The Department of Health and Human Services generally may not purchase personal protective equipment, critical medical supplies, or certain fabric products not produced in the United States for the Strategic National Stockpile.

The Department of State shall report annually to Congress information about (1) foreign individuals and entities that materially contributed to China's failure to comply with the Joint Declaration or the Basic Law; and (2) foreign financial institutions that knowingly conducted a significant transaction with such identified individuals and entities. An individual, entity, or financial institution may be excluded from this report for various reasons, such as to protect an intelligence source. The President may impose property-blocking sanctions on an individual or entity named in a report, and visa-blocking sanctions on a named individual. Such sanctions are mandatory if an individual or entity is named in two reports. The President shall impose various sanctions on a financial institution named in a report, such as prohibiting the institution from receiving loans from a U.S. financial institution.

Additionally, drug manufacturers must issue rebates to the CMS for drugs dispensed to eligible low-income individuals. Subject to civil monetary penalties, a Medicare or MA PDP sponsor must report, both to drug manufacturers and to the CMS, specified information related to the determination and payment of such rebates.

**Long Title**: This resolution calls on the Hong Kong government to begin negotiations with protesters to address their five central demands, including the formal withdrawal of the extradition bill that prompted the protests and the complete implementation of universal adult suffrage. It also condemns (1) the Hong Kong government's use of force against the demonstrators, (2) the government's characterizations of the protests as "riots" and attempts to blame the United States for the city's political situation, and (3) Chinese state media for targeting staff and family members of the U.S. Consulate General in Hong Kong. (Hong Kong is a part of China but has a mostly separate legal system, which includes protection for civil liberties including freedom from arbitrary imprisonment. Protests sprung up in opposition to the introduction of an extradition bill that critics say would allow extradition to jurisdictions that do not have such protections, in particular mainland China.)

**Bill Name**: HB6402
**Long Title**: Increases flexibility for state and local agencies to provide continuity of services during the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) national emergency. In particular, the bill allows certain state and local unobligated funds to be used for administrative purposes to carry out local workforce investment activities under one-stop delivery systems if the funds are used to respond to such emergency. (A one-stop delivery system is a system under which entities responsible for administering separate workforce investment, educational, and other human resource programs and funding streams (referred to as one-stop partners) collaborate to create a seamless system of service delivery that will enhance access to the programs' services and improve long-term employment outcomes for individuals receiving assistance.) The bill also allows the use of certain state reserved unobligated funds for (1) responding to the national emergency, and (2) distributing by the governor of such state to local boards most impacted by the coronavirus for activities related to responding to such emergency. The Department of Labor must award national dislocated worker grants, with emphasis on state or local areas most impacted by the emergency for activities directly supporting the response to the emergency and related-recovery efforts (e.g., training and temporary employment and certain layoff response activities).

**Long Title**: Establishes the Emergency Social Insurance Program to coordinate and deliver direct payments to small businesses and workers affected by COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019). Specifically, the Social Security Administration and the Department of Labor shall assist participating states, through existing state agency mechanisms, to offer expanded unemployment insurance for workers who are unemployed or idle because of COVID-19. Through an agreement with Labor, participating states must provide temporary emergency COVID-19 unemployment or short-time compensation payments to such workers, plus specified additional amounts for certain categories of workers. Such compensation payments shall not be regarded as income. If an individual receives compensation payments through a knowing false statement or misrepresentation, such individual shall be ineligible for further assistance and subject to prosecution. The Small Business Administration must provide grants to certain small businesses that have suffered substantial economic injury as a result of COVID-19, giving priority consideration to (1) small businesses with fewer than 100 employees per location; (2) small businesses owned by minorities, women, or veterans; (3) small businesses where the owner's pay is equal to or less than 25 times the average employee's pay; and (4) small businesses that have not fired or laid off employees, reduced salaries, or changed any labor contracts. The amount of such grants shall not exceed necessary maintenance costs (e.g., payroll support and increased costs of obtaining unavailable materials), and any overpayment of grants shall be automatically considered as zero-interest loans. Such grant amounts shall be excluded from gross income, for income tax purposes.

**Long Title**: Requires the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to make low-income housing assistance available for otherwise qualifying families with at least one member who has eligible immigration status. Specifically, a family with at least one member who has been affirmatively established as eligible for assistance, and no member who has been affirmatively established as ineligible due to immigration status, is eligible for prorated assistance based on the number of family members with established eligibility. Current law specifies that any assistance to such a mixed-status family must be prorated, and HUD has generally allowed such a family to receive assistance in this manner. However, a proposed HUD rule from May 10, 2019, would generally prohibit assistance to mixed-status families. The bill further specifies that, if such assistance for an individual is to be terminated on the basis of immigration status, it may instead be continued if necessary to avoid the division of a family in which any member has eligible immigration status. Under current law, such assistance may be continued under these circumstances only if the head of household or the individual's spouse has eligible immigration status.
