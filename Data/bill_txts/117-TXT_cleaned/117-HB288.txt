cials breathing room to make reasonable mistakes of 
1
fact and law.

(2) The Supreme Court has observed that

qualified immunity balances two important interests, 
4
the need to hold law enforcement officers account-
5
able when they exercise power irresponsibly and the 
6
need to shield officers from harassment, distraction, 
7
and liability when they perform their duties reason-
8
ably.
