H1254
2 
•HR 1254 IH
(1) Under the status quo, empty Federal agen-
1
cy office buildings cannot be sold by agencies that 
2
want to be efficient. Instead, each agency must let 
3
their vacant office spaces remain a purposeless and 
4
excessive cost on their balance sheets. 
5
(2) According to a 2017 Congressional Re-
6
search Service report, in fiscal year 2016, U.S. Fed-
7
eral agencies owned 3,120 buildings that were va-
8
cant or unutilized and owned another 7,859 build-
9
ings that were partially empty or underutilized. 
10
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
11
gress that— 
12
(1) Federal agencies should not be limited when 
13
placing unused or underused office space on the 
14
market for sale; and 
15
(2) Federal agencies should be able to sell their 
16
unused offices to provide for greater fiscal responsi-
17
bility and better stewardship of taxpayer dollars.
