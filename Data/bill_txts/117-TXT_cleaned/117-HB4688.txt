(1) the Federal Government serves the people

improve public services provided by the Federal Gov-
1
ernment based on customer feedback; 
2
(2) the people of the United States deserve a 
3
Federal Government that provides efficient, effec-
4
tive, equitable, and high-quality services and cus-
5
tomer experiences across multiple channels; 
6
(3) many agencies, offices, programs, and Fed-
7
eral employees provide excellent customer experi-
8
ences to individuals, but many parts of the Federal 
9
Government still fall short on delivering the cus-
10
tomer experience that individuals have come to ex-
11
pect from the private sector; 
12
(4) according to the 2020 American Customer 
13
Satisfaction Index, the Federal Government ranks 
14
among the bottom of all industries in the United 
15
States in customer satisfaction; 
16
(5) providing an equitable, reliable, transparent, 
17
and responsive customer experience to individuals 
18
improves the confidence of the people of the United 
19
States in their Government and helps agencies 
20
achieve greater impact and fulfill their missions; and 
21
(6) improving service to individuals requires 
22
agencies to work across organizational boundaries, 
23
leverage technology, collect and share standardized

data, and develop customer-centered mindsets and 
1
experience strategies. 
2
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
3
gress that— 
4
(1) all agencies should strive to provide a high- 
5
quality, courteous, effective, and efficient customer 
6
experience to the people of the United States and 
7
seek to measure, collect, report, and use metrics re-
8
lating to the experience of individuals interacting 
9
with agencies to continually improve the customer 
10
experience of the people of the United States; and 
11
(2) adequate Federal funding is needed to en-
12
sure agency staffing levels that can provide the pub-
13
lic with an improved customer experience.
