tury between Romania and the United States;

Whereas over more than a century, the Romanian-American 
community’s rich cultural heritage is a valued part of 
American society; 
Whereas over the past 25 years, Romania has advanced secu-
rity and democratic principles in Central and Eastern 
Europe and the Black Sea region, and has actively con-
tributed, as a member of NATO and the European 
Union, to forging a strong transatlantic partnership, in-
cluding as one of the top troop contributors to NATO’s 
almost 2-decade mission in Afghanistan; 
Whereas Romania is a founding member of the Bucharest 
Nine regional NATO cooperation format, aimed at 
strengthening defense and deterrence on the eastern 
flank of the alliance; 
Whereas Romania’s commitment to transatlantic common de-
fense includes hosting the Aegis Ashore Missile Defense 
System, which protects NATO members from ballistic 
missile threats; 
Whereas Romania has played a pivotal role in NATO’s ef-
forts to counter Russian aggression, consistently meeting 
or exceeding NATO’s 2 percent of GDP defense spending 
target, and offering to host one of NATO’s 4 new multi-
national battlegroups; 
Whereas Romania’s efforts and commitment to support 
Ukraine in the face of Russia’s unprovoked and illegal 
military invasion deserve full recognition; 
Whereas Romania provides critical assistance to the Ukrain-
ian people, offering refuge and safe passage to over one 
million Ukrainians fleeing Russia’s invasion;
