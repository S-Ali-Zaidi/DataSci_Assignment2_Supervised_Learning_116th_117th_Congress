pital or unit. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Access to Inpatient

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:

•HR 8746 IH
(1) Intensive, coordinated medical rehabilitation 
1
provided in inpatient rehabilitation hospitals and 
2
units is critical to Medicare beneficiaries with inju-
3
ries, illnesses, disabilities, and chronic conditions in 
4
order to return to health, full function, independent 
5
living, and a high quality of life. 
6
(2) The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Serv-
7
ices (in this section referred to as ‘‘CMS’’) uses an 
8
‘‘intensity of therapy’’ requirement to help determine 
9
which Medicare beneficiaries are appropriate for 
10
treatment in an inpatient rehabilitation hospital or 
11
unit. CMS has interpreted the intensity of therapy 
12
requirement through application of the so-called 
13
‘‘Three Hour Rule’’ (42 C.F.R. 412.622(a)(3)(ii)) 
14
which requires the patient to be able to participate 
15
in three hours of rehabilitation therapy per day, five 
16
days per week, or 15 hours of rehabilitation therapy 
17
over a one-week period. 
18
(3) In 1989, a Federal district court held that 
19
‘‘Medicare determinations for hospital rehabilitation 
20
care are to be based upon an assessment of each in-
21
dividual patient’s need for care’’ and ‘‘denials of ad-
22
missions, services, and/or Medicare coverage based 
23

‘Three Hour Rule’, or other ‘rules of thumb’ are not 
1
appropriate.’’ Hooper v. Sullivan, No. H–80–99 (D. 
2
Conn. 1989). 
3
(4) Before 2010, a CMS ruling explicitly stated 
4
that physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech 
5
therapy, and orthotics and prosthetics were counted 
6
toward the Three Hour Rule on an as-needed basis. 
7
In addition, the CMS ruling stated that ‘‘other 
8
therapeutic modalities’’ that were determined by the 
9
physician and the rehabilitation team to be needed 
10
by the patient ‘‘on a priority basis’’ would quality to-
11
ward satisfaction of the rule (HCFA Ruling 85–2). 
12
(5) This language allowed physicians with spe-
13
cialized training and experience in inpatient hospital 
14
rehabilitation to prescribe the mix of skilled thera-
15
pies and services appropriate to meet the needs of 
16
each individual patient in order to satisfy the Three 
17
Hour Rule in the inpatient rehabilitation hospital or 
18
unit setting. 
19
(6) CMS by regulation (74 Fed. Reg. 39811 
20
(August 7, 2009)) revised these prior requirements, 
21
effective January 1, 2010. The Secretary of Health 
22
and Human Services acknowledged that he is bound 
23
by the court’s decision in Hooper v. Sullivan that 
24
‘‘rules of thumb’’, including the Three Hour Rule, 
25

•HR 8746 IH
may not be imposed to deny IRF coverage. The Sec-
1
retary stated that he would ‘‘monitor the appro-
2
priateness of instances where IRFs demonstrate the 
3
required level of intensity’’ without meeting the 
4
Three Hour Rule. 
5
(7) The Secretary’s 2010 regulation limited the 
6
Three Hour Rule to recognize only four skilled serv-
7
ices (namely, physical therapy, occupational therapy, 
8
and speech language pathology services as well as 
9
orthotics and prosthetics) and required that the pa-
10
tient’s physician must certify that the patient re-
11
quires, at admission, at least two of the four therapy 
12
modalities, one of which must be either physical 
13
therapy or occupational therapy. The Secretary’s 
14
2010 regulation removed the discretion of the physi-
15
cian, in consultation with the rehabilitation team, to 
16
prescribe other skilled modalities and therapeutic 
17
services needed by the patient that would count to-
18
ward satisfaction of the Three Hour Rule. As a re-
19
sult, the full complement of medically necessary, 
20
skilled therapy services may not be available to inpa-
21
tient rehabilitation hospital patients as part of their 
22
plan of care. 
23
(8) Skilled, therapeutic modalities in addition to 
24
physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech lan-
25

•HR 8746 IH
guage pathology services, and orthotic and prosthetic 
1
services that should be counted toward the Three 
2
Hour Rule include recreational therapy services, res-
3
piratory therapy, and other skilled modalities as de-
4
termined by the Secretary when such skilled services 
5
are medically necessary and prescribed by a physi-
6
cian as part of the patient’s plan of care. 
7
(b) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act is to restore 
8
reliance on the professional judgment of the treating phy-
9
sician, in consultation with the rehabilitation team, when 
10
determining whether a Medicare patient meets the inten-
11
sity of therapy requirement of an inpatient rehabilitation 
12
hospital or unit in order for that patient to gain access 
13
to the appropriate mix of medically necessary, rehabilita-
14
tion services in that setting. This Act retains the current 
15
requirement that the patient must need at admission phys-
16
ical therapy, occupational therapy, speech language pa-
17
thology services, or orthotic and prosthetic services but 
18
permits the patient’s physician to modify the intensive re-
19
habilitation therapy program after admission to include 
20
additional necessary therapy modalities.
