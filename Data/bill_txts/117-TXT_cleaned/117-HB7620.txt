(c) WAIVER AUTHORIZED.— 
9
(1) IN GENERAL.—A recipient described in sub-
10
section (a) may request a waiver from the Secretary 
11
of Education of one or more of the requirements 
12
under such subsection on the basis that the require-
13
ment poses an insurmountable financial burden to 
14
the recipient and the recipient has been unable to se-
15
cure sufficient grants under subsection (d). 
16
(2) ALTERNATIVE PLAN.—The waiver process 
17
shall include requiring the recipient to submit an al-
18
ternative plan for ensuring students are aware of 
19
their rights under title IX of the Education Amend-
20
ments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.) and have 
21
access to a Title IX Coordinator. At the very min-
22
imum within their alternative plan, the recipient 
23
shall establish a partnership, through a memo-
24
randum of understanding, with a local rape crisis

TO
FOLLOW
ALTERNATIVE 
9
PLAN.—If a recipient has such a waiver approved 
10
but does not follow their alternative plan, or the Sec-
11
retary of Education deems their plan was insuffi-
12
cient to prevent and respond to sexual harassment 
13
and assault, the Secretary shall take such action as 
14
may be appropriate to withhold Federal financial as-
15
sistance. A waiver granted under this subsection 
16
shall be valid for 2 years. 
17
(d) GRANTS.—To carry out this section, there are au-
18
thorized to be appropriated to the Secretary of Education 
19
