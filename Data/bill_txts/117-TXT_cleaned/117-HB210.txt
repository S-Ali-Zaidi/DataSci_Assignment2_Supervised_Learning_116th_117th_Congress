A BILL 
To coordinate Federal research and development efforts fo-
cused on STEM education and workforce development 
in rural areas, including the development and application 
of new technologies to support and improve rural STEM 
education, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 210 IH
(1) The supply of STEM workers is not keeping 
1
pace with the rapidly evolving needs of the public 
2
and private sector, resulting in a deficit often re-
3
ferred to as a STEM skills shortage. 
4
(2) According to the Bureau of Labor Statis-
5
tics, the United States will need one million addi-
6
tional STEM professionals than it is on track to 
7
produce in the coming decade. 
8
(3) Many STEM occupations offer higher 
9
wages, more opportunities for advancement, and a 
10
higher degree of job security than non-STEM jobs. 
11
(4) The 60,000,000 individuals in the United 
12
States who live in rural settings are significantly 
13
under-represented in STEM. 
14
(5) According to the National Center for Edu-
15
cation Statistics, nine million students in the United 
16
States—nearly 20 percent of the total K–12 popu-
17
lation—attend rural schools, and for reasons rang-
18
ing from teacher quality to shortages of resources, 
19
these students often have fewer opportunities for 
20
high-quality STEM learning than their peers in the 
21
Nation’s urban and suburban schools. 
22
(6) Rural areas represent one of the most 
23
promising, 
yet 
underutilized, 
opportunities 
for 
24
00:50 Feb 05, 2021
H210

•HR 210 IH
STEM education to impact workforce development 
1
and regional innovation, including agriculture. 
2
(7) The study of agriculture, food, and natural 
3
resources involves biology, engineering, physics, 
4
chemistry, math, geology, computer science, and 
5
other scientific fields. 
6
(8) Employment in computer and information 
7
technology occupations is projected to grow 11 per-
8
cent from 2019 to 2029. To help meet this demand, 
9
it is important rural students have the opportunity 
10
to acquire computing skills through exposure to com-
11
puter science learning in grades Pre-K through 12 
12
and in informal learning settings. 
13
(9) More than 293,000,000 individuals in the 
14
United States use high-speed broadband to work, 
15
learn, access healthcare, and operate their busi-
16
nesses, while 19,000,000 individuals in the United 
17
States still lack access to high-speed broadband. 
18
Rural areas are hardest hit, with over 26 percent of 
19
individuals in rural areas in the United States lack-
20
ing access to high-speed broadband compared to 1.7 
21
percent of individuals in urban areas in the United 
22
States.
