SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Since the onset of airborne naval military 
3
training in Nevada as early as 1944, residents of the 
4
Silver State have coped with the direct and indirect 
5
effects of training overflights and bombing ranges. 
6
(2) Such effects are heard, seen, and felt most 
7
acutely near the military installations and bombing 
8
ranges dedicated to furthering the mission interests 
9
of the United States Armed Forces, but such effects 
10
can extend more than 100 miles beyond the bound-
11
aries of the installation or range, as exemplified by 
12
Naval Air Station Fallon. 
13
(3) Additionally, Nevadans who live, work, and 
14
engage in recreational activities beneath dedicated 
15
air training routes throughout central, north-central, 
16
and northwestern Nevada must deal with persistent 
17
noise and periodic disruptions related to training ac-
18
tivities day and night. 
19

•HR 5243 IH
(4) The economic, environmental, and commu-
1
nity impacts of the Fallon Range Training Complex 
2
and Naval Air Station Fallon are seen throughout 
3
all of northern Nevada and are not limited to just 
4
the geographic footprint of the Fallon Range Train-
5
ing Complex. 
6
(5) Although direct impacts of military training 
7
are centered in Churchill County to the north, east, 
8
and south of Naval Air Station Fallon, adjoining 
9
counties of Elko, Eureka, Lander, Lyon, Mineral, 
10
Nye, Pershing, and Washoe also commonly endure 
11
both high- and low-level overflights. 
12
(6) Providing for the common sense rationaliza-
13
tion of the 19th century checkerboard land-owner-
14
ship and public interest conveyances of land, for ex-
15
ample, for fire stations, airports, and municipal 
16
parks, represents reasonable mitigation for ongoing 
17
impacts to Nevada’s communities. 
18
(7) On April 15, 2020, and again on October 
19
1, 2020, the Churchill County Board of Commis-
20
sioners passed resolutions supporting legislation to 
21
address and mitigate the Fallon Range Training 
22

24

(B) the wilderness areas are generally not 
13
suitable for use or development of new water re-
