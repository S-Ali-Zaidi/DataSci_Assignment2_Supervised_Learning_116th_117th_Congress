To direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection 
Agency to take certain actions related to pesticides that 
may affect pollinators, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Pollination services are a vital part of agri-
3
cultural 
production, 
valued 
at 
over 
4
$125,000,000,000 globally. According to a 2014 
5
Presidential memorandum, pollinators provide for an 
6
annual amount of $24,000,000,000 to the economy 
7
of the United States and honey bees account for 
8
$15,000,000,000 of such amount. Similarly, polli-
9
nation services of native pollinators, such as bumble-
10
bees, squash bees, and mason bees, contribute over 
11
$3,000,000,000 to the United States agricultural 
12
economy and are estimated to contribute between 
13
$937,000,000 and $2,400,000,000 to the economy 
14
of California alone. 
15
(2) One-third of food produced in North Amer-
16
ica—including nearly 100 varieties of fruits and 
17
vegetables such as almonds, avocados, cranberries, 
18
and apples—depends on pollination by bees. 
19
(3) Over the past several years, documented in-
20
cidents of colony collapse disorder and other forms 
21
of excess bee mortality have been at a record high, 
22
with some beekeepers repeatedly losing 100 percent 
23
of their operations. The national honey crop re-
24
ported in 2017 was the lowest in many decades. 
25
00:30 Jul 10, 2021
H4079

•HR 4079 IH
(4) National surveys sponsored by the Federal 
1
Government indicates that United States beekeepers 
2
lost between 35 and 46 percent of their hives annu-
3
ally between 2012 and 2018. On average, two-thirds 
4
of beekeepers experienced loss rates greater than the 
5
established acceptable winter mortality rates. 
6
(5) According to scientists at the Department 
7
of Agriculture, current losses of honey bee colonies 
8
are too high to confidently ensure the United States 
9
will be able to meet the pollination demands for agri-
10
cultural crops. 
11
(6) Native pollinators, such as bumblebees, have 
12
also suffered alarming population declines. There are 
13
currently more than 40 pollinator species federally 
14
listed as threatened or endangered, and most re-
15
cently, the iconic monarch butterfly has declined by 
16
90 percent. 
17
(7) Scientists have linked the use of a certain 
18
class of systemic insecticides, known as neonicotin-
19
oids, to the rapid decline of pollinators and to the 
20
deterioration of pollinator health. 
21
(8) Neonicotinoids cause sublethal effects, in-
22
cluding impaired foraging and feeding behavior, dis-
23
orientation, weakened immunity, delayed larval de-
24
velopment, and increased susceptibility to viruses, 
25

•HR 4079 IH
diseases, and parasites. Numerous reports also docu-
1
ment acute, lethal effects from the application of 
2
neonicotinoids. 
3
(9) Conclusions from a recent global review of 
4
the impacts of systemic pesticides, primarily neonico-
5
tinoids, warn that they are causing significant dam-
6
age to a wide range of beneficial invertebrate spe-
7
cies, are a key factor in the decline of bees, and pose 
8
a global threat to biodiversity and ecosystem serv-
9
ices. Another recent global review documented high 
10
levels of freshwater contamination. 
11
(10) Science has demonstrated that a single 
12
corn kernel coated with a neonicotinoid is toxic 
13
enough to kill a songbird. Peer-reviewed research 
14
from the Netherlands has shown that the most se-
15
vere bird population declines occurred in those areas 
16
where neonicotinoid pollution was highest. Starlings, 
17
tree sparrows, and swallows were among the most 
18
affected. 
19
(11) In June 2013, over 50,000 bumblebees 
20
were killed as a direct result of exposure to a neonic-
21
otinoid applied to linden trees for cosmetic purposes. 
22
(12) In February 2014, Eugene, Oregon, voted 
23
to ban the use of neonicotinoid pesticides on city 
24
property. Similar bans and restrictions have been 
25
00:30 Jul 10, 2021
H4079

•HR 4079 IH
enacted in Thurston County, Spokane, and Seattle, 
1
Washington, Portland, Oregon, Skagway, Alaska, 
2
and several other communities across the United 
3
States. The States of Connecticut, Maryland, and 
4
Vermont have all passed laws restricting consumer 
5
use of neonicotinoids in favor of less toxic alternative 
6
products and practices. 
7
(13) In June 2014, a Presidential memo-
8
randum established a Pollinator Health Task Force 
9
after identifying pollinator decline as a threat to the 
10
sustainability of food production systems, the agri-
11
cultural economy, and the health of the environment 
12
in the United States. 
13
(14) In July 2014, the United States Fish and 
14
Wildlife Service announced plans to phase out 
15
neonicotinoid pesticides in all national wildlife ref-
16
uges across the United States by January 2016. The 
17
United States Fish and Wildlife Service recognized 
18
that the prophylactic use of neonicotinoids for agri-
19
cultural purposes harms a wide range of nontarget 
20
species and is therefore inconsistent with the man-
21
agement policy of the United States Fish and Wild-
22
life Service. 
23
(15) In October 2014, an assessment by the 
24
Environmental Protection Agency found that neonic-
25
00:30 Jul 10, 2021
H4079
6 
•HR 4079 IH
otinoid seed coatings provide little benefit to overall 
1
soybean crop yield. Additional studies determined 
2
that in approximately 80 to 90 percent of row crop 
3
uses, neonicotinoid coatings are unnecessary. The 
4
prophylactic overuse of neonicotinoids violates the 
5
fundamental principles of integrated pest manage-
6
ment. 
7
(16) In November 2014, the Province of On-
8
tario, Canada, announced the province will move to 
9
restrict the use of neonicotinoid-coated corn and soy-
10
bean seeds because of the broad harms from their 
11
overuse, with a goal of 80 percent reduction by 
12
2017. 
13
(17) In September 2015, the Circuit Court of 
14
the United States for the Ninth Circuit ruled to re-
15
voke the Environmental Protection Agency’s ap-
16
proval for sulfoxaflor—a neonicotinoid pesticide. 
17
(18) In November 2016, Health Canada, the 
18
department of the Government of Canada respon-
19
sible for national public health, proposed a ban on 
20
almost all outdoor uses of the neonicotinoid 
21
imidacloprid, saying it is contaminating Canadian 
22
waterways at levels that can harm insects and the 
23
ecosystem.

(19) The President’s budget for fiscal year 
1
2018 cuts funding for pesticide review programs of 
2
the Environmental Protection Agency by 20 percent 
3
delaying reviews of new, potentially safer pesticides 
4
as well as reviews of older, more dangerous pes-
5
ticides such as neonicotinoids. 
6
(20) In 2018, the European Union permanently 
7
banned 
outdoor 
uses 
of 
the 
neonicotinoids 
8
imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam after 
9
the European Food Safety Authority confirmed their 
10
risks to honey bees and wild bees. 
11
(21) In August 2018, Health Canada, proposed 
12
a ban on almost all outdoor uses of clothianidin and 
13
thiamethoxam similar to the proposed ban on 
14
imidacloprid, citing concerns that the chemicals are 
15
contaminating Canadian waterways at levels that 
16
can harm insects and the ecosystem. 
17
(22) Worldwide, insects are experiencing popu-
18
lation declines twice as high as those of vertebrate 
19
species, with a rate of local species extinction eight 
20
times higher than that of vertebrate species. About 
21
one-third of all insect species are threatened with ex-
22
tinction, with 1 percent added every year. Such de-
23
clines result in an annual 2.5 percent loss in bio-
24

•HR 4079 IH
mass, which threatens the overall functioning and 
1
stability of ecosystems worldwide. 
2
(23) Insect biodiversity is essential to the prop-
3
er functioning of ecosystems, and declines are dis-
4
rupting pollination, natural pest control, food re-
5
sources, nutrient recycling, and decomposition serv-
6
ices provided by insects. 
7
(24) Major declines in insect populations can be 
8
traced to the expansion of intensive, industrial agri-
9
culture, including the systematic and widespread use 
10
of insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, and chemical 
11
fertilizers. 
12
(25) Because insects constitute the world’s 
13
most abundant and speciose animal group and pro-
14
vide critical services within ecosystems, such event 
15
cannot be ignored and should prompt decisive action 
16
to avert a catastrophic collapse of nature’s eco-
17
systems.
