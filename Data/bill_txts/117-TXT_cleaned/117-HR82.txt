Whereas the gentlewoman from Georgia, Representative Mar-
jorie Taylor Greene, serves on the Committee on Edu-
cation and Labor and the Committee on the Budget, two 
committees of considerable influence within the House of 
Representatives; 
Whereas clause 1 of rule XXIII of the Rules of the House 
of Representatives provides, ‘‘A Member, Delegate, Resi-
dent Commissioner, officer, or of the House shall behave 
at all times in a manner that shall reflect creditably on 
the House.’’;

Whereas Representative Greene’s actions and statements do 
not reflect the values of decency, morality, or civility, and 
represent a pattern of appalling behavior wholly unac-
ceptable in the House of Representatives and the United 
States; 
Whereas Representative Greene has fomented divisions within 
Congress and the United States as a whole by advocating 
for and encouraging more extremism, violence, and sedi-
tion, making racist statements, and spreading baseless 
conspiracy theories; 
Whereas Representative Greene has consistently advocated 
for extremism, violence, and sedition against Members of 
Congress and former elected officials, specifically— 
(1) supporting individuals calling for the execution 
of Democratic leaders, including former President Barack 
Obama, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and Speaker 
Nancy Pelosi on social media; 
(2) liking a comment on social media that urged for 
a ‘‘civil war 2.0’’ to begin; 
(3) posting on social media a photoshopped picture 
of herself holding a rifle alongside photos of Democratic 
Representatives Ilhan Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, 
and Rashida Tlaib, captioned ‘‘Squad’s worst night-
mare’’; 
(4) as part of an effort to raise funds for her cam-
paign, using an expletive to describe House Speaker 
Nancy Pelosi, writing that ‘‘we’re going to kick that 
b—— out of Congress’’; and 
(5) liking a comment on Facebook that said, ‘‘a bul-
let to the head would be quicker’’ to remove House 
Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and another comment that said

‘‘through removal or death, doesn’t matter, as long as 
she goes’’; 
Whereas Representative Greene has consistently made racist, 
anti-Semitic, and Islamaphobic statements, including— 
(1) saying she would feel ‘‘proud’’ to see a Confed-
erate monument if she were Black because it symbolizes 
progress made since the Civil War; 
(2) calling George Soros, a Holocaust survivor, a 
‘‘Nazi himself trying to continue what was not finished’’; 
and 
(3) calling Black voters ‘‘slaves’’ to the Democratic 
Party and comparing the election of Muslim lawmakers 
to an ‘‘Islamic invasion of the U.S. government’’; 
Whereas Representative Greene has consistently spread de-
bunked and baseless far-right extremist conspiracy theo-
ries, including— 
(1) perpetuating false claims of massive voter fraud 
in the 2020 election, which was a direct catalyst for the 
insurrection at the United States Capitol on January 6, 
2021; 
(2) spreading damaging and hurtful false claims 
that several deadly school shootings had been staged, in-
cluding the tragedies of Sandy Hook Elementary School 
in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012, and Marjory 
Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, in 
2018, and confronting David Hogg, a survivor of the 
2018 Parkland school shooting, calling him a ‘‘coward’’ 
and accusing him of being paid by George Soros, a liberal 
philanthropist; and 
(3) promoting the QAnon conspiracy theory, which 
claims that prominent Americans are engaged in a secret 
plot to control the world and exploit children, which has

been deemed by the FBI to ‘‘motivate some domestic ex-
tremists, wholly or in part, to engage in criminal or vio-
lent activity’’; 
Whereas the Department of Homeland Security recently 
issued a warning to ‘‘alert the public about the growing 
threat of ‘ideologically-motivated violent extremists’ ’’ agi-
tated about President Biden’s inauguration and ‘‘per-
ceived grievances fueled by false narratives’’, and Rep-
resentative Greene’s statements and actions directly sow 
these warnings; 
Whereas Representative Greene’s continued presence on the 
Committee of Education and Labor and the Committee 
on the Budget would bring disrepute to the House of 
Representatives and would interfere with the important 
business of those committees to undertake a fact-based 
analysis of the issues facing the American people; and 
Whereas Representative Greene should be immediately re-
moved from her committee assignments in light of the 
aforementioned conduct she has exhibited: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the following named Member be, and 
1
is hereby, removed from the following standing committees
