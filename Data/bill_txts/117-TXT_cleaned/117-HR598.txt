Articles of Impeachment exhibited by the House of 
4
Representatives of the United States of America in the 
5
name of itself and of the people of the United States of 
6
America, against Joseph Robinette Biden, President of the

United States of America, in maintenance and support of

its impeachment against him for dereliction of duty by

leaving behind thousands of American civilians and Af-

In his conduct as President of the United States, in

ARTICLE I 
4
Whereas Joe Biden failed to secure the extraction of 
5
thousands of American civilians and Afghan allies before 
6
and during the withdrawal between August 14 and August 
7
16, 2021, putting thousands of lives in imminent danger 
8
from the Taliban. 
9
Whereas, as Commander-in-Chief, Joe Biden has 
10
armed our enemies by leaving numerous weapons, ammu-
11
nition, and other military equipment which could be used 
12
against American citizens, allies, and other civilians in Af-
13
ghanistan. 
14
Whereas Joe Biden has shown the American people 
15
that his administration failed to properly prepare for the 
16
extraction of civilian and military assets from the nation 
17
of Afghanistan. 
18
Whereas Joe Biden abandoned tens of thousands of 
19
American citizens and Afghan allies stuck in Afghanistan 
20
at danger of being captured, tortured, held hostage for 
21
ransom, or killed. 
22
In each of these actions, Joseph R. Biden showed 
23
grave dereliction of duty and continues to demonstrate

that he is unfit to hold the office of President of the 
1
United States. 
2
Wherefore President Biden, by such conduct, has 
3
demonstrated that he will remain a threat to national se-
4
curity and the Constitution if allowed to remain in office, 
5
and has acted in a manner grossly incompatible with self- 
6
governance and the rule of law. President Biden thus war-
7
rants impeachment and trial, removal from office, and dis-
8
qualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust, 
9
or profit under the United States.
