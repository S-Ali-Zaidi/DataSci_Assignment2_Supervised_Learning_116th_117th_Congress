•HR 3632 IH
(1) Caregiving is an essential element of family 
1
life and a vital service for children, the ill, the dis-
2
abled, and the elderly. 
3
(2) The establishment of a caregiver credit 
4
would bolster the economic prospects of unpaid care-
5
givers and would provide them with vital retirement 
6
security. 
7
(3) According to projections of the Office of the 
8
Chief Actuary of the Social Security Administration 
9
published in November of 2020, the combined Old- 
10
Age and Survivors Insurance and Federal Disability 
11
Insurance Trust Funds will be able to pay scheduled 
12
benefits in full until 2034. 
13
(b) SENSE OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.— 
14
It is the sense of the House of Representatives that the 
15
United States Congress must address the unfair exclusion 
16
of professional and hardworking home care providers who 
17
are not eligible to receive Social Security or Medicare be-
18
cause they provide paid care to a family member with a 
19
disability under programs operated at the State and local 
20
level for general health and welfare protection.
