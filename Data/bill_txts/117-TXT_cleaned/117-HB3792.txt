SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
3
Congress finds that— 
4
(1) childhood trauma is a pervasive public 
5
health issue with long-term negative effects that 
6
costs the United States thousands of lives and bil-
7
lions of dollars; 
8
(2) addressing childhood and adolescent trauma 
9
requires a comprehensive Federal approach that rec-
10
ognizes its severe impact and prioritizes trauma-in-
11
formed prevention and treatment that is reparative, 
12
healing-centered, gender-responsive, culturally spe-
13
cific, and community-based; 
14
(3) adults who have suffered from adverse 
15
childhood experiences are at much greater risk of 
16
death, including as the result of heart disease, lung 
17
disease, cancer, substance use disorder, and suicide; 
18
(4) childhood and adolescent exposures to ad-
19
verse childhood experiences are generational and 
20
persistent and can lead to complex trauma and toxic 
21
stress impacting brain development and triggering 
22
epigenetics; 
23
(5) any Federal effort to prevent and treat 
24
trauma must acknowledge and address the impact of

but are not limited to, the trauma of— 
2
(A) historical and ongoing systemic racism, 
3
sexism, xenophobia, homophobia, transphobia, 
4
and ableism that have led to generations of vio-
5
lence and injustice and have robbed commu-
6
nities of their health, freedom, and peace of

8
(B) police brutality, racial profiling, and 
9
criminalization, as well as heightened police ac-
10
tivity and surveillance in some areas with high-
11
er police-reported crime, whether as a result of 
12
community violence or of racial profiling; 
13
(C) poverty and other systemic inequities, 
14
including lack of health care, housing insta-
15
bility, poor housing conditions, hunger and food 
16
instability and the accompanying malnutrition, 
17
and environmental injustice resulting from gen-
18
erations of racist policies, historic redlining,
