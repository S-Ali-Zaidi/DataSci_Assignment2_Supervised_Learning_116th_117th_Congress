duced by the agency, as the committee or subcommittee 
10
considers necessary, a senior responsible official shall ei-
11
ther comply with that request or file written objections 
12
within the time frame for response set forth in the request. 
13
‘‘(b) If the senior responsible official files written ob-
14
jections within the timeframe for response, the committee

or subcommittee shall seek to resolve these objections 
16
through negotiation and accommodation. If a resolution 
17
cannot be reached, staff shall so certify to the chair of 
18
the committee.

‘‘(c) If the senior responsible official fails to file ob-
20

12
‘‘(e) The senior responsible official and other wit-

14
be accompanied only by non-government private counsel 
15
during all proceedings conducted pursuant to this clause 
16
(even if the witness is a government official or employee).

The committee in taking testimony will follow the proce-

19
objections to questions that are prescribed by the Com-
20

with respect to the records, information, and witnesses at

objections. The senior responsible official shall personally 
4
attend this hearing but may not assert executive privilege 
5
on behalf of the President, and the committee chair may 
6
grant an exception for good cause shown. 
7
‘‘(g) If the committee overrules some or all of the ob-
8
jections asserted, it may issue an order of compliance 
9
which states the grounds for rejection of the objections, 
10
the date for compliance, and an advisement of the legal 
11
consequences of a failure to comply. The senior responsible 
12
official and subpoenaed witnesses shall comply with such 
13
order within the timeframe for response. If prior to such 
14
time, the President asserts a claim of executive privilege, 
15
it shall be made personally and in writing, and will be con-
16
sidered by the committee with all other timely objections. 
17
Witnesses may not assert a claim of executive privilege 
18
in the absence of such an assertion by the President.

rises to the level of a breach of the constitutional privilege

shall include a detailed history and nature of the con-
4
troversy and attempts at accommodation; the legal issues 
5
raised; the legislative need for the information sought; the 
6
legal and practical reasons for the determination that the

objections were rejected; and the recommended penalty

under paragraph (j).

11

14
for passage of the resolution. At the conclusion of the al-
15
lotted period for presentations, questions and debate, a 
16
vote on passage of the resolution will be taken. If the vote 
17

•HRES 869 IH 
‘‘(2)(A) If the recommended penalty as approved by

the House is a monetary penalty, the contemnor may be 
2
assessed by the House an initial penalty of not more than 
3
$25,000 and total penalties of not more than $100,000. 
4
The amount of the ultimate penalty depends on the timeli-
5

6

7
$25,000 may be increased by the chair of the committee 
8
involved by increments of not more than $25,000 after a 
9
one-time waiting period of 10 calendar days from the ini-
10
tial penalty until the $100,000 maximum is reached. The 
11
10-day waiting period shall only be observed after the first 
12
penalty. Upon expiration of the 10-day waiting period, if 
13
the chair deems the measure of compliance by the 
14
contemnor to be insufficient to satisfy the legislative needs 
15
of the committee, the chair may, over a period of not more 
16
than fifteen days, at his or her discretion, increase the 
17
penalty by increments of not more than $25,000 until the 
18
maximum is reached. Upon expiration of the 10-day wait-
19
ing period, the General Counsel is authorized to recover

any accrued penalties, but only if the contemnor has failed

to comply with the subpoena before the end of such 10-

11
penalty imposed by the House. Nor shall any person,

group, entity, organization, or corporation be permitted to 
13
pay any monetary penalties directly on behalf of a 
14
contemnor. The House may regard such actions to com-

pensate, reimburse or provide remunerations or payments

to a contemnor as an obstruction of its investigative and
