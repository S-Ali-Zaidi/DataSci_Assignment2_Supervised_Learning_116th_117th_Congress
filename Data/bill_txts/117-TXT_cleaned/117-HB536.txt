the Secretary of Homeland Security may arrest an 
22
alien and, in accordance with this section, may,

6
to an unaccompanied alien child (as defined in sec-
7
tion 462(g)(2) of the Homeland Security Act of 
8
2002 (6 U.S.C. 279(g)(2))). Such an alien shall be

48 hours after taking an alien into custody, the Sec-
17
retary of Homeland Security shall make an initial 
18
custody determination with regard to that alien, and 
19
provide that determination in writing to the alien. If 
20
the Secretary determines that the release without 
21
conditions of an alien will not reasonably assure the 
22
appearance of the alien as required or will endanger 
23
the safety of any other person or the community, the 
24
custody determination under this paragraph will im-

pose the least restrictive conditions, as described in 
1
paragraph (4).

‘‘(2) TIMING.—If an alien seeks to challenge 
3
the initial custody determination under paragraph 
4
(1), the alien shall be provided with the opportunity 
5
for a hearing before an immigration judge to deter-
6
mine whether the alien should be detained, which 
7
hearing shall occur not later than 72 hours after the 
8
initial custody determination, except that an immi-
9
gration judge may grant a reasonable continuance 
10
upon the alien’s request for additional time to pre-
11
pare for the hearing. 
12
‘‘(3) PRESUMPTION OF RELEASE.—In a hearing 
13
under this subsection, there shall be a rebuttable 
14
presumption that the alien should be released. The 
15
Government shall have the duty of rebutting this 
16
presumption by clear and convincing evidence based 
17
on credible and individualized information that es-
18
tablishes that the use of alternatives to detention 
19
will not reasonably assure the appearance of the 
20
alien at removal proceedings, or that the alien is a 
21
threat to another person or the community. The fact 
22
that an alien has a prior conviction or a criminal 
23
charge pending against the alien may not be the sole 
24
factor to justify the continued detention of the alien.
