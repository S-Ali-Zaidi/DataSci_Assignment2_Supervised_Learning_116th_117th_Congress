A BILL 
To establish a process for the creation of minority impact 
assessments to determine whether pending bills, if en-
acted, are likely to create or exacerbate disparate out-
comes among racial or ethnic minority groups, and for 
other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Wayne Ford Racial

Impact Statement Act of 2022’’.

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:

•HR 8795 IH
(1) Minority impact assessments are a tool for 
1
lawmakers to evaluate potential disparities of pro-
2
posed legislation prior to adoption and implementa-
3
tion. 
4
(2) There are 5,000 criminal penalties in Fed-
5
eral law and the number of Federal statutes car-
6
rying a criminal penalty has increased by 50 percent 
7
since the 1980s. 
8
(3) The enactment of criminal laws and pen-
9
alties is a serious matter and the legislative process 
10
should reflect the gravity of this process. 
11
(4) The United States Sentencing Commission 
12
was created to reduce sentencing disparities, which 
13
provides a strong foundation for equity action in this 
14
branch of Government. 
15
(5) Criminal laws conceived and voted on in 
16
haste can lead to the enactment of unnecessary, du-
17
plicative, ineffective, or prejudicial criminal pen-
18
alties. 
19
(6) In 2008, Iowa was the first State to enact 
20
minority impact assessment legislation, authored by 
21
former State Representative Wayne Ford, requiring 
22
that criminal justice legislation be evaluated with re-
23
spect to whether it will disproportionately impact 
24
specified minority groups. 
25

•HR 8795 IH
(7) The Iowa law created a measurable decline 
1
in Black incarceration rates from 13.6 per 1 White 
2
resident to 9 to 1 White residents, demonstrating 
3
that minority impact assessments can effectively ad-
4
dress disparities in lawmaking and sentencing. 
5
(8) Similar legislation has since been considered 
6
or enacted in New York, Arizona, Arkansas, Cali-
7
fornia, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Lou-
8
isiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, 
9
Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, 
10
Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Washington, 
11
Wisconsin, Connecticut, Oregon, New Jersey, Colo-
12
rado, Maine, and Virginia. 
13
(9) The NAACP and the National Black Cau-
14
cus of State Legislators have adopted resolutions in 
15
support of Federal legislation providing for the use 
16
of minority impact assessments. 
17
(10) Precedent for adopting procedural meas-
18
ures that increase critical deliberation and require 
19
independent analysis at the Federal level of racial 
20
disparities in criminal justice already exists in the 
21
form of scores from the Congressional Budget Of-
22
fice. 
23
(11) Deeply rooted discriminatory policies and 
24
practices in our legal system fuel systemic inequal-
25

•HR 8795 IH
ities and cycles of poverty and hardship, stigmatize 
1
and exclude people with criminal records, and im-
2
pede community integration. 
3
(12) Requiring an independent assessment with 
4
sobering information on the impact of legislation 
5
that adds or increases criminal penalties is one way 
6
to level the inequities that disproportionately impact 
7
people of color, LGBTQ individuals, individuals with 
8
disabilities, and other vulnerable groups in sen-
9
tencing. 
10
(13) Congress must institutionalize a more de-
11
liberate and evidence-based process prior to voting to 
12
criminalize conduct and impose harsh sentences. 
13
(b) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act is to provide 
14
a tool for lawmakers and Federal agencies to determine 
15
whether pending bills and proposed rules, if enacted, are 
16
likely to create or exacerbate disparate outcomes among 
17
racial or ethnic minority groups.
