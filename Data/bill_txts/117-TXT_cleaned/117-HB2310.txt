SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress makes the following findings: 
2
(1) The evidence for human-induced climate 
3
change is overwhelming and undeniable. 
4
(2) Atmospheric carbon can be significantly re-
5
duced through conservation, by shifting to renewable 
6
energy sources such as solar, wind, tidal, and geo-
7
thermal, and by increasing the efficiency of build-
8
ings, including domiciles, and transportation. 
9
(3) Providing clear information about climate 
10
change, in a variety of forms, can remove the fear 
11
and the sense of helplessness, and encourage individ-
12
uals and communities to take action. 
13
(4) Implementation of measures that promote 
14
energy efficiency, conservation, and renewable en-
15
ergy will greatly reduce human impact on the envi-
16
ronment. 
17
(5) Informing people of new technologies and 
18
programs as they become available will ensure max-
19
imum understanding and maximum effect of those 
20
measures. 
21
(6) More than 3,000,000 students graduate 
22
from high schools and colleges in the United States 
23
each year, armed with attitudes, skills, and knowl-
24
edge about the climate that inform their actions. 
25

H2310

•HR 2310 IH
(7) The effect on the climate, positive or nega-
1
tive, of each of those 3,000,000 students lasts be-
2
yond a lifetime. 
3
(8) Those students need to be prepared to im-
4
plement changes in professional and personal prac-
5
tices, to support and help develop new technology 
6
and policy, and to address the coming social and 
7
economic challenges and opportunities arising from a 
8
changing climate. 
9
(9) It has been demonstrated that the people of 
10
the United States overwhelmingly support teaching 
11
students about the causes, consequences, and poten-
12
tial solutions to climate change in all 50 States and 
13
more than 3,000 counties across the United States. 
14
(10) Only 30 percent of middle school and 45 
15
percent of high school science teachers understand 
16
the extent of the scientific consensus on climate 
17
change.
