SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The COVID–19 pandemic precipitated a 
3
global response to the need for treatments, thera-
4
peutics, and vaccines, challenging the life sciences 
5
community to innovate at an unprecedented pace. 
6
(2) In response to this need, life sciences com-
7
panies across the globe have brought over 600 novel 
8
COVID–19 treatments under development, including 
9
130 vaccines in clinical trials and 176 in pre-clinical 
10
trials. 
11
(3) Predictable, transparent, and enforceable 
12
intellectual property rights have been a cornerstone 
13
of establishing the United States as an innovation 
14
hub before and during the pandemic. 
15
(4) The first two COVID–19 vaccines to be au-
16
thorized for emergency use in the United States em-
17
ploy mRNA technology that applies years of sci-
18
entific research driven by effective, internationally 
19
recognized intellectual property rights, underscoring 
20
the historic mobilization in response to the pandemic 
21
that has resulted in unprecedented partnerships be-
22
tween governments and business to develop and de-
23
ploy intellectual property solutions in record time. 
24
(5) The petition, led by India and South Africa, 
25
before the World Trade Organization’s Trade-Re-

lated Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights Coun-
1
cil, seeking a waiver to suspend all intellectual prop-
2
erty rights associated with COVID–19 innovations, 
3
would establish unnecessary barriers to innovation 
4
that put at risk the life-saving solutions to the pan-
5
demic the world desperately needs. 
6
(6) Proper and effective intellectual property 
7
rights enable the greatest access to life-saving cures 
8
and treatments through voluntary licensing agree-
9
ments and other valuable partnerships already being 
10
established between life sciences innovators and vac-
11
cine manufacturers across the globe. 
12
(7) Inadequate United States leadership in de-
13
fending intellectual property rights internationally 
14
invites foreign competitor governments, including the 
15
Government of China, to take advantage of weak 
16
global protections, thereby undermining American 
17
investment and United States leadership in the life 
18
sciences. 
19
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
20
It is the sense of Congress that— 
21
(1) the United States should continue to pro-
22
mote strong international property rights inter-
23
nationally; and

(2) it is in the national interest of the United 
1
States to oppose efforts to transfer American intel-
2
lectual property and technology to China or other 
3
countries seeking to profit off United States invest-
4
ments.

SEC. 4. PROHIBITION ON USE OF FUNDS.

otherwise made available to the United States Trade Rep-

negotiation or approval of—

(1) the ‘‘Waiver from Certain Provisions of the

TRIPS Agreement for the Prevention, Containment, 
12
and Treatment of COVID–19’’ put forth by India 
13
and South Africa; or 
14
