•HR 3054 IH
(1) In 1935, during the Great Depression, 
1
President Franklin Delano Roosevelt established 
2
The Federal Writers’ Project of the New Deal Era. 
3
This program was organized to employ writers, edi-
4
tors, historians, researchers, journalists, librarians, 
5
broadcasters, photographers, and others to document 
6
American society. 
7
(2) The Federal Writers Project employed up to 
8
10,000 people between its founding in 1935 during 
9
the Great Depression and the publication of its first 
10
guides in 1943. 
11
(3) The original Federal Writers’ Project had 
12
many successes, such as— 
13
(A) the American Guide Series, which cov-
14
ered 48 States, 40 cities, 18 regions and terri-
15
tories and countless counties, with John 
16
Steinbeck calling the Series, ‘‘the most com-
17
prehensive account of the United States ever 
18
got together, and nothing since has even ap-
19
proached it. It was compiled during the depres-
20
sion by the best writers in America’’; 
21
(B) creating opportunities for writers who 
22
went on to become some of America’s greatest 
23
authors, including Ralph Ellison, Richard 
24
Wright, Saul Bellow, and Zora Neale Hurston;

(C) developing the Slave Narrative Project, 
1
the largest project to document the experience 
2
of formerly enslaved people, which included oral 
3
histories and photography telling the story of 
4
10,000 Americans in 17 States; 
5
(D) creating over 1,000 books and pam-
6
phlets covering local and regional histories, folk-
7
lore collections, humor, ethnic studies, and na-
8
ture studies. 
9
(4) The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the 
10
decline of local newspapers and other local news out-
11
lets, with more than 60 local newsrooms closing over 
12
the course of 2020 and other newsrooms enduring 
13
cutbacks. More than 200 counties have no daily or 
14
weekly newspaper and 68 percent of these counties 
15
are nonmetro areas, home to small towns and rural 
16
communities. 
17
(5) Following the death of more than 550,000 
18
people due to COVID-19 and more than a year of 
19
physical restrictions, the United States has experi-
20
enced a historic period with a profound and lasting 
21
impact on society. 
22
(6) The original Federal Writers’ Project pro-
23
vided the opportunity to observe and document the 
24
Great Depression. Further, the impact of COVID-
