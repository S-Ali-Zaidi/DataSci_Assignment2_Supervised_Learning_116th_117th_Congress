SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds that— 
2
(1) meat and poultry slaughter and processing 
3
is a particularly dangerous occupation, with meat 
4
and poultry processing workers suffering injuries at 
5
measurably higher rates than workers in other pri-
6
vate sector industries; 
7
(2) meat and poultry processing workers face 
8
double the rate of amputations as the average work-
9
er in private industry, and injuries such as sprains, 
10
lacerations, and contusions are common among poul-
11
try workers; 
12
(3) meat and poultry processing workers suffer 
13
from musculoskeletal injuries, such as carpal tunnel 
14
syndrome, ‘‘trigger finger’’, tendinitis, rotator cuff 
15
injuries, lower back injuries, and chronic pain and 
16
numbness, in numbers that can exceed 50 percent of 
17
workers; 
18
(4) higher line speeds in meat and poultry proc-
19
essing facilities is a recognized risk factor that leads 
20
to increased risk of both laceration and musculo-
21
skeletal injuries;

•HR 6250 IH
(5) meat and poultry processing work was and 
1
continues to be particularly dangerous during the 
2
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID–19) pandemic 
3
due to, among other factors— 
4
(A) the easily transmissible nature of the 
5
virus via aerosol and droplet; 
6
(B) the close proximity of meat processing 
7
workers; 
8
(C) cold conditions inside meat processing 
9
facilities; and 
10
(D) the pace and physical rigor of meat 
11
and poultry processing work; 
12
(6) during the COVID–19 pandemic, covered 
13
establishments have implemented policies and proce-
14
dures that have— 
15
(A) increased workers’ risk of exposure to 
16
SARS–CoV–2; 
17
(B) prioritized processing rates over work-
18
er health and welfare; and 
19
(C) caused a disparate adverse impact on 
20
Asian, Black, and Latino workers in the meat 
21
and poultry processing industry; 
22
(7) enforcement of requirements of the Occupa-
23
tional Safety and Health Administration in the meat

and poultry processing industry has been fundamen-

2
(8) meat and poultry processing workers are 
3
subjected to exploitative conditions and abusive be-
4
havior by employers— 
5
(A) including— 
6
(i) use of abusive and humiliating 
7
shouting by supervisors accusing workers 
8
of not working fast enough and harassing 
9
them to work ‘‘faster’’ and ‘‘harder’’; 
10
(ii) use of sexualized language to har-
11
ass women workers to work ‘‘harder’’ and 
12
‘‘faster’’; 
13
(iii) patterns of direct sexual harass-
14
ment and incidents of sexual assault; and 
15
(iv) little or no accountability or re-
16
dress for emotional, sexualized, or psycho-
17
logical abuse due to— 
18
(I) weak enforcement of, and 
19
noncompliance 
with,
