A BILL 
To amend chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, to provide 
that major rules of the executive branch shall have no 
force or effect unless a joint resolution of approval is 
enacted into law. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Regulations from the 
4
Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act of 2021’’. 
5
SEC. 2. PURPOSE. 
6
The purpose of this Act is to increase accountability 
7
for and transparency in the Federal regulatory process. 
8
Section 1 of article I of the United States Constitution 
9
grants all legislative powers to Congress. Over time, Con-
10
gress has excessively delegated its constitutional charge 
11
while failing to conduct appropriate oversight and retain 
12
accountability for the content of the laws it passes. By 
13
requiring a vote in Congress, the REINS Act will result 
14
in more carefully drafted and detailed legislation, an im-
15
proved regulatory process, and a legislative branch that 
16
is truly accountable to the American people for the laws 
17
imposed upon them.
