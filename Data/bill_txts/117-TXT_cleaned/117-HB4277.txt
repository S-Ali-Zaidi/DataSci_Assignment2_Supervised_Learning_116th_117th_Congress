SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Overdraft Protection 
2
Act of 2021’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. 
4
(a) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) Overdraft coverage is a form of short-term 
6
credit that financial institutions market for con-
7
sumer accounts. Historically, financial institutions 
8
covered overdrafts for a fee on an ad hoc basis. 
9
(2) With the growth in specially designed soft-
10
ware programs and in consumer use of debit cards, 
11
overdraft coverage for a fee has become more preva-
12
lent. 
13
(3) Many financial institutions market a range 
14
of overdraft options but aggressively encourage con-
15
sumers to consent to the most expensive option, 
16
where a high flat fee is collected for every individual 
17
overdraft transaction. 
18
(4) Many financial institutions collect a high 
19
flat fee, including for small dollar transactions, each 
20
time the institution covers an overdraft, impose mul-
21
tiple overdraft coverage fees within a single day, and 
22
charge additional fees for each day during which the 
23
account remains overdrawn. 
24
(5) Such abusive practices in connection with 
25
overdraft coverage fees have deprived consumers of 
26
19:28 Jul 26, 2021
H4277
3 
•HR 4277 IH
meaningful options and placed significant financial 
1
burdens on low- and moderate-income consumers. 
2
(6) African Americans and Latinos are dis-
3
proportionately harmed by overdraft coverage fees 
4
and more likely to pay multiple overdraft coverage 
5
fees annually. 
6
(b) PURPOSE.—It is the purpose of this Act to pro-
7
tect consumers by limiting abusive overdraft coverage fees 
8
and practices, and by providing meaningful disclosures 
9
and consumer choice in connection with overdraft coverage 
10
fees. 
11
SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. 
12
(a) ADDITIONAL DEFINITIONS.—Section 140B of the 
13
Truth in Lending Act, as added by section 4, is amended 
14

20
other than a travelers check.
