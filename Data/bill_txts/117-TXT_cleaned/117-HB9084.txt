5
application of applicable State law or regulation, the State

of California (including any agency or board of the State

11
yield is greater than it otherwise would have been under 
12
the Preferred Alternative, then that additional yield shall 
13
be made available to the SWP for delivery to SWP Con-
14
tractors to offset that reduced water supply. If it is nec-
15
essary to reduce water supplies for any authorized uses 
16
of the CVP or CVP Contractors to make available to the

SWP that additional yield, such reductions shall be ap-
18
plied proportionately to those authorized uses or CVP con-
