ered company violated this Act, the Federal Trade 
8
Commission may commence a civil action, in its own 
9
name by any of its attorneys designated by it for

which the defendant resides or is found or has an 
1
agent, without respect to the amount in controversy, 
2
and shall recover threefold the damages by the devel-
3
oper sustained and the cost of suit, including a rea-
4
sonable attorney’s fee. The court may award under 
5
this paragraph, pursuant to a motion by such devel-
6
oper promptly made, simple interest on actual dam-
7
ages for the period beginning on the date of service 
8
of the pleading of the developer setting forth a claim 
9
under this Act and ending on the date of judgment, 
10
or for any shorter period therein, if the court finds 
11
that the award of such interest for such period is 
12
just in the circumstances. In determining whether 
13
an award of interest under this paragraph for any 
14
period is just in the circumstances, the court shall 
15
consider only— 
16
(A) whether the developer or the opposing 
17
party, or either party’s representative, made 
18
motions or asserted claims or defenses so lack-
19
ing in merit as to show that such party or rep-
20
resentative acted intentionally for delay or oth-
21
erwise acted in bad faith; 
22
(B) whether, in the course of the action in-
23
volved, the developer or the opposing party, or 
24
either party’s representative, violated any appli-

•HR 7030 IH
cable rule, statute, or court order providing for 
1
sanctions for dilatory behavior or otherwise pro-
2
viding for expeditious proceedings; and 
3
(C) whether the developer or the opposing 
4
party, or either party’s representative, engaged 
5
in conduct primarily for the purpose of delaying 
6
the litigation or increasing the cost thereof. 
7
(2) INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.—Except as provided 
8
in paragraph (3), any developer shall be entitled to 
9
sue for and have injunctive relief, in any court of the 
10
United States having jurisdiction over the parties, 
11
against threatened loss or damage by a violation of 
12
this Act, when and under the same conditions and 
13
principles as injunctive relief against threatened con-
14
duct that will cause loss or damage is granted by 
15
courts of equity, under the rules governing such pro-
16
ceedings, and upon the execution of proper bond 
17
against damages for an injunction improvidently 
18
granted and a showing that the danger of irrep-
19
arable loss or damage is immediate, a preliminary 
20
injunction may issue. In any action under this para-
21
graph in which the plaintiff substantially prevails, 
22
the court shall award the cost of suit, including a 
23
reasonable attorney’s fee, to such plaintiff.
