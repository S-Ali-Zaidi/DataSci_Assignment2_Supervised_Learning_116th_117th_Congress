RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the United States should reengage with trading partners, 
particularly like-minded Allies with market-based econo-
mies and high labor and environmental standards, to 
promote trade in environmental goods, services, and tech-
nologies in new or existing bilateral and plurilateral dia-
logues with a view to negotiating a new environmental 
goods agreement with updated product coverage to 
broaden United States export opportunities, support

United States jobs, and enhance the environmental con-
tribution of any new trade agreement. 
Whereas innovation and access to affordable new environ-
mental goods and technologies are key to addressing cli-
mate change while preserving economic opportunity and 
energy security for countries in all stages of economic de-
velopment; 
Whereas goods manufactured in the United States are 40 
percent more carbon-efficient than the world average; 
Whereas the United States is currently responsible for ap-
proximately 12 percent of global greenhouse gas emis-
sions; 
Whereas the United States is a global innovation leader, in-
cluding with respect to cutting-edge technologies that re-
duce carbon emissions, improve energy efficiency, benefit 
the environment, and make workers safer and more pro-
ductive; 
Whereas a structural imbalance exists in the global environ-
mental goods trade as United States environmental goods 
are subject to higher tariffs (in some cases more than 40 
percent) in some markets, including India and China, 
while the United States imposes very low tariffs on im-
ported environmental goods; 
Whereas China is a net exporter of environmental goods and 
Chinese manufacturers enjoy significantly greater global 
market share than United States producers despite very 
low levels of Chinese consumption of environmental 
goods; 
Whereas high tariffs imposed on environmental goods by for-
eign countries undermine global efforts to reduce green-
house gas emissions, achieve gains in energy efficiency,

advance resilient communities, and improve air and water 
quality, while disadvantaging United States manufactur-
ers and workers that make such products by reducing ex-
port opportunities; 
Whereas eliminating foreign tariffs on such products would 
enable the United States and other countries to more 
easily export high-quality, affordable environmental prod-
ucts to aid in global efforts to combat climate change, re-
duce pollution, and improve energy efficiency, while also 
leveling the playing field for United States manufacturers 
and supporting green jobs; 
Whereas the United States environmental services industry 
also is a global leader, and improved market access for 
United States environmental goods also can create more 
opportunities around the world for United States environ-
mental service providers; 
Whereas, on July 8, 2014, the United States and other mem-
ber countries of the World Trade Organization, account-
ing for nearly 90 percent of global exports in environ-
mental goods, initiated negotiations to establish an Envi-
ronmental Goods Agreement (EGA) to eliminate tariffs 
on a number of important environmental products, in-
cluding wind turbines, solar panels, water treatment fil-
ters, solar water heaters, and air pollution controls; 
Whereas the United States played a leading role in negotia-
tions to establish the EGA while such negotiations were 
active from 2014 to 2016; 
Whereas United States innovators have developed new clean 
energy products since 2016, and increased global sales of 
these products can increase opportunities for United

States workers while reducing carbon emissions and im-
proving energy efficiency; 
Whereas a high-standard environmental goods agreement 
would not undermine enforcement of United States laws 
and regulations, including those that respond to unfair 
trade practices and block imports produced by forced 
labor; and 
Whereas initiatives to facilitate trade in environmental goods, 
services, and technologies should be part of a larger set 
of efforts aimed at addressing climate change, boosting 
innovation, and strengthening the United States econ-
omy: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-

(A) goods produced by United States in-

tive impact on the environment if trade in those 
7
goods increased; 
8
(B) the United States share of global ex-

10
(C) the market access barriers that prevent

environmental goods around the world;
