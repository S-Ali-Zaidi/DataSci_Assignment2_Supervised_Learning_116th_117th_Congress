dent of the United States. 
Resolved, That Merrick Brian Garland, Attorney Gen-

States Senate:

Articles of impeachment exhibited by the House of 
3
Representatives of the United States of America in the 
4
name of itself and of the people of the United States of 
5
America, against Merrick Brian Garland, Attorney Gen-
6
eral of the United States of America, in maintenance and 
7
support of its impeachment against him for endangering, 
8
compromising, and undermining the justice system of the 
9
United States by facilitating the persecution of President 
10
Joseph R. Biden, Jr.’s, political rival, Donald J. Trump, 
11
the 45th President of the United States. 
12
The Constitution provides that the House of Rep-
13
resentatives ‘‘shall have the sole Power of Impeachment’’ 
14
and that the Attorney General, as a civil officer of the 
15
United States, ‘‘shall be removed from Office on Impeach-
16
ment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other 
17
high Crimes and Misdemeanors’’. 
18
In his conduct as Attorney General of the United 
19
States, in violation of his constitutional oath faithfully to 
20
execute the office of the Attorney General of the United 
21
States, and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect, 
22
and defend, the Constitution of the United States, Merrick 
23
Brian Garland continues to materially endanger the jus-
24
tice system of the United States and empower President

Attorney General Garland’s personal approval to seek 
5
a search warrant for the raid on the home of the 45th 
6
President of the United States, Donald J. Trump, con-
7
stitutes a blatant attempt to persecute a political oppo-

nent. 
9
Rather than adhering to an oath he took to defend 
10
and secure our country and uphold the Constitution when 
11
he was sworn in as Attorney General on March 11, 2021, 
12
Attorney General Garland has willingly refused to ensure 
13
that the laws passed by Congress and signed by the Presi-
14
dent are faithfully executed. 
15
Attorney General Garland has failed to uphold his 
16
oath and has instead overseen a denigration of the prin-
17
ciples of our democratic republic by politicizing the De-
18
partment of Justice, and utilizing the Federal Bureau of 
19
Investigation as a Federal police force to punish or intimi-
20
date anyone who questions or opposes the current regime. 
21
Attorney General Garland has taken measures to si-
22
lence the voice of millions of citizens of the United States 
23
by persecuting the former duly elected and lawful Presi-
24
dent of the United States, and potential Presidential can-
25
didate, Donald J. Trump.

ARTICLE II

The Supreme Court upheld in Department of the 
3
Navy v. Egan that the President, as Commander in Chief, 
4
has the power to control the classification and declassifica-
5
tion of documents pertaining to national security. 
6
The Executive Vesting Clause of the Constitution 
7
grants the President the authority to declassify documents 
8
in the public interest that originated in any department 
9
or agency of the executive branch, pursuant to Executive 
10
Order 13526. 
11
Attorney General Garland, in persecuting former 
12
President Donald J. Trump over documents he legally de-
13
classified, has engaged in a pattern of conduct that is in-
14
compatible with his duties as a civil officer of the United 
15
States. 
16
Attorney General Garland, in his failure to uphold 
17
the oath he took, has, by his actions, lost the trust of citi-
18
zens of the United States to faithfully execute the laws 
19
of the United States without partisan bias. 
20
Attorney General Garland’s effort to unseal the 
21
search warrant for the home of former President Donald 
22
J. Trump constitutes an attempt to intimidate, harass, 
23
and potentially disqualify a political challenger to Presi-
24

Attorney General Garland’s actions run counter to 
1
the steps that employees of the executive branch must take 
2
to avoid ‘‘an appearance of loss of impartiality’’. 
3
Attorney General Garland’s failure to address the 
4
conflict of interest arising from the persecution of his em-
5
ployer, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr.’s, political adver-
6
sary, Donald J. Trump, demonstrates that he is unfit to 
7
hold the office of Attorney General. 
8
Attorney General Garland, by such conduct, has dem-
9
onstrated that he will remain a threat to the justice system 
10
of the United States of America if allowed to remain in 
11
office, and has acted in a manner grossly incompatible 
12
with democracy, self-governance, and the rule of law. 
13
Wherefore, Merrick Brian Garland, thus warrants 
14
impeachment and trial, removal from office, and disquali-
15
fication to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust, or 
16
profit under the United States.
