A BILL 
To direct the Secretary of Energy to establish a program 
to reduce the vulnerability of the electric grid to physical 
attack, cyber attack, and other events, including by en-
suring that large power transformers and other critical 
electric grid equipment are strategically located to ensure 
timely replacement of such equipment as may be nec-
essary, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

IENCE PROGRAM. 
6
(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—The Secretary shall establish 
7
a program to reduce the vulnerability of the electric grid 
8
to physical attack, cyber attack, electromagnetic pulse, 
9
geomagnetic disturbances, severe weather, climate change, 
10
and seismic events, including by— 
11
(1) ensuring that large power transformers, 
12
generator step-up transformers, power conversion 
13
equipment, and other critical electric grid equipment 
14
are strategically located to ensure timely replace-
15
ment of such equipment as may be necessary to re-
16
store electric grid function rapidly in the event of se-
17
vere damage to the electric grid due to physical at-
18
tack, cyber attack, electromagnetic pulse, geo-
19
magnetic disturbances, severe weather, climate 
20
change, or seismic events; and 
21
(2) establishing a coordinated plan to facilitate 
22
transportation of large power transformers, gener-
23
ator step-up transformers, power conversion equip-
24
ment, and other critical electric grid equipment.

(b) TRANSFORMER RESILIENCE.—In carrying out 
1
the program established under subsection (a), the Sec-
2
retary shall— 
3
(1) improve large power transformers, gener-
4
ator step-up transformers, power conversion equip-
5
ment, and other critical electric grid equipment by 
6
reducing their vulnerabilities; 
7
(2) develop, test, and deploy innovative equip-
8
ment designs that are more flexible and offer greater 
9
resiliency of electric grid functions; 
10
(3) coordinate with industry and manufacturers 
11
to standardize large power transformers, generator 
12
step-up transformers, power conversion equipment, 
13
and other critical electric grid equipment; 
14
(4) monitor and test large power transformers, 
15
generator step-up transformers, power conversion 
16
equipment, and other critical electric grid equipment 
17
that the Secretary determines may pose a risk to the 
18
bulk-power system or national security; and 
19
(5) facilitate the domestic manufacturing of 
20
large power transformers, generator step-up trans-
21
formers, power conversion equipment, and other crit-
22
ical electric grid equipment through the issuance of 
23
grants and loans, and through the provision of tech-
24
nical support.

(c) STRATEGIC EQUIPMENT RESERVES.— 
1
(1) AUTHORIZATION.—In carrying out the pro-
2
gram established under subsection (a), the Secretary 
3
may establish one or more federally owned strategic 
4
equipment reserves, as appropriate, to ensure na-
5
tionwide access to large power transformers, gener-
6
ator step-up transformers, power conversion equip-
7
ment, and other critical electric grid equipment. 
8
(2) CONSIDERATION.—In establishing any fed-
9
erally owned strategic equipment reserve, the Sec-
10
retary may consider existing spare transformer and 
11
equipment programs and requirements established 
12
by the private sector, Regional Transmission Organi-
13
zations, Independent System Operators, and State 
14
regulatory authorities. 
15
(3) IRON AND STEEL.— 
16
(A) IN GENERAL.—In establishing any fed-
17
erally owned strategic equipment reserve, no 
18
Federal funds shall be used for the purchase of 
19
large power transformers, generator step-up 
20
transformers, power conversion equipment, or 
21
other critical electric grid equipment unless all 
22
of the iron and steel products used in such 
23
equipment are produced in the United States.
