Whereas parents and active, involved members of our commu-
nities have a First Amendment right to express their per-
sonal opinions on schooling decisions; 
Whereas parents should be empowered to directly commu-
nicate with Federal, State, and local education profes-
sionals regarding decisions that directly shape and deter-
mine their children’s education, development, health, and 
well-being; 
Whereas open and cooperative relationships between parents 
and schools have significant and long-lasting positive ef-
fects on the academic and socioemotional development of 
children; 
Whereas parents’ concerns over inappropriate or unwanted 
materials deserves to be expressed and should be fully 
considered by school professionals; 
Whereas parents are joining together to form grassroots or-
ganizations and community coalitions to present concerns

Whereas community input that is presented in a lawful and 
appropriate manner should always be received and not 
discouraged: Now, therefore, be it
