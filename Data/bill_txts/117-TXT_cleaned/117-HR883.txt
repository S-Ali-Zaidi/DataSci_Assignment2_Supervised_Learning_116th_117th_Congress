RESOLUTION 
Recognizing National Sanctity of Human Life Day. 
Whereas life is inherently valuable at every stage and should 
be protected; 
Whereas condoning abortion based on the sex or a disability 
of a child in the womb is barbaric and should be con-
demned; 
Whereas a child in the womb is a unique person with his or 
her own genetic code and is a different being than the 
mother; 
Whereas pro-life crisis pregnancy centers provide millions of 
dollars in free care annually to women seeking alter-
natives to abortion; 
Whereas the pro-life movement has made a concerted effort 
to care for women, children, and families not just during 
pregnancy, but afterwards as well;

Whereas the abortion industry deceives women about the bio-
logical realities of children in the womb, falsely claiming 
that children in the womb are ‘‘clumps of cells’’; 
Whereas, as early as eight weeks, a child in the womb begins 
developing hands, feet, and teeth, and neural pathways 
are formed during this time that will last through the 
child’s entire life; 
Whereas a growing body of scientific literature indicates that 
children in the womb feel pain prior to 15 weeks gesta-
tion, and nearly every major organ is present and func-
tional by then; 
Whereas a child in the womb has a heart that will beat 
roughly 15,000,000 times by 15 weeks; 
Whereas abortion not only ends the life of a human being in 
the womb, but abortion also poses serious health risks 
and complications for mothers; 
Whereas the abortion industry does not disclose the emotional 
and psychological toll a woman will face when ending a 
pregnancy through abortion; 
Whereas, across the world, elective abortions past 20 weeks 
are permissible in only a handful of nations such as 
North Korea, China, and unfortunately, the United 
States; 
Whereas since Roe v. Wade was decided on January 22, 
1973, an estimated 62 million lives have been lost to 
abortion; 
Whereas, in recent years, States across the country have 
taken the bold and noble stand to provide protections for 
the unborn and ensure their right to live;

Whereas just governments have an obligation to protect vul-
nerable and innocent children, including voiceless children 
in the womb; 
Whereas failing to protect the rights of children in the womb 
is a failure to live up to the ideals found in the Declara-
tion of Independence ‘‘that all men are created equal, 
that they are endowed by their Creator with certain 
unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty 
and the pursuit of Happiness’’; 
Whereas abortion is a moral wrong that has no place in 
American society; 
Whereas we mourn the suffering and loss of life since Roe 
v. Wade; and 
Whereas January 22 would be an appropriate day to estab-
lish National Sanctity of Human Life Day: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the designation of National Sanc-
2
tity of Human Life Day; and 
3
(2) supports and encourages every American to 
4
reflect on the value of life and defending life at all 
5
stages.
