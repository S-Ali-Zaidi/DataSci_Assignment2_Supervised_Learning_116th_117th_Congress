tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
1
It is the sense of Congress that: 
2
(1) The Center for Medicare and Medicaid In-
3
novation (CMI) represents a valuable tool for testing 
4
innovative health care payment and service delivery 
5
models which can improve the coordination, quality, 
6
and efficiency of health care services. 
7
(2) The model testing process is intended to 
8
test concepts on a limited scale first in Phase I, then 
9
assess initial results, and, if results merit, expand 
10
the model to a larger test in Phase II to confirm the 
11
initial results. 
12
(3) Starting model testing on a limited scale, 
13
assessing results, and then expanding the model to 
14
confirm initial results protects the integrity of the 
15
Medicare program by minimizing unintentional 
16
losses or negative impacts to the patients or pro-
17
viders participating in Phase I model testing. 
18
(4) CMI should focus its attention on models 
19
most likely to succeed and should continually assess 
20
models and terminate those which are not gener-
21
ating results in keeping with its purpose—lowering 
22
costs while maintaining or preserving patient out-
23
comes. 
24
(5) Mandatory models may be necessary to test 
25
certain payment models but should be used judi-
26

•HR 5125 IH
ciously and be as limited in scope as possible to min-
1
imize accidental adverse impacts. 
2
(6) As CMI may waive certain provisions of 
3
Medicare regulations, Congress may block models 
4
which functionally alter or change the underlying ex-
5
isting statutes.
