SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Substance use problems are a significant 
3
problem among veterans and can negatively impact 
4
a veteran’s health and quality of life. 
5
(2) Veterans can turn to alcohol or drugs in an 
6
attempt to relieve stress or the symptoms of mental 
7
health disorders. 
8
(3) Rates of substance use disorder among 
9
women veterans range from three to 16 percent of 
10
the population 
11
(4) Women veterans face a unique set of chal-
12
lenges associated with their military service that can 
13
lead to substance abuse. 
14
(5) Women veterans aged 35 and older were 
15
found to have higher rates of substance-use dis-
16
orders than their non-veteran counterparts. 
17
(6) Studies indicate women veterans are twice 
18
as likely as men veterans to develop posttraumatic 
19
stress disorder, twice as likely to have serious psy-
20
chological distress, and approximately one out of 
21
four women veterans reports military sexual trauma. 
22
(7) Studies indicate that women veterans with 
23
a substance-use disorder diagnosis have higher rates 
24
of suicide than their non-veteran peers, and women 
25

•HR 344 IH
veterans are more than twice as likely to die by sui-
1
cide than non-veteran women. 
2
(8) Health services that are women-specific can 
3
be important to effective care, and women veterans 
4
consider the availability of women-specific care as 
5
extremely important. 
6
(9) While the Secretary of Veterans Affairs pro-
7
vides women veterans with substance use treatment 
8
through a number of programs, the Women Vet-
9
erans’ Therapeutic Transitional Residence Program 
10
is a model for providing treatment and rehabilitative 
11
services to women veterans with drug and alcohol 
12
dependency, and it is critical that the Secretary 
13
identifies the need for, and feasibility of, similar pro-
14
grams throughout the health care system of the De-
15
partment.
