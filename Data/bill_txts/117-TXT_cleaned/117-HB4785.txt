Congress finds the following:

•HR 4785 IH
(1) The People’s Republic of China (PRC) con-
1
tinues to repress the distinct Islamic, Turkic identity 
2
of Uyghurs and members of other minority groups 
3
of 
the 
Xinjiang 
Uyghur 
Autonomous 
Region 
4
(XUAR) in northwestern China. 
5
(2) Uyghurs, and other predominantly Muslim 
6
ethnic minorities living in the XUAR, have main-
7
tained throughout their history a distinct religious 
8
and cultural identity. 
9
(3) Human rights, including freedom of religion 
10
or belief, and respect for the Uyghurs’ unique Mus-
11
lim identity are legitimate interests of the inter-
12
national community, including the particular concern 
13
of Islamic nations. 
14
(4) The People’s Republic of China has ratified 
15
the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and 
16
Cultural Rights and is thereby bound by its provi-
17
sions. China has also signed the International Cov-
18
enant on Civil and Political Rights. Article One of 
19
both covenants state that all peoples have the right 
20
to self-determination. 
21
(5) An official campaign to encourage Han Chi-
22
nese migration into the XUAR has placed immense 
23
pressure on those who seek to preserve the ethnic, 
24
cultural, religious, and linguistic traditions of the 
25

Uyghurs people. Chinese authorities have supported 
1
an influx of Han Chinese economic immigrants into 
2
the XUAR, implemented discrimination against 
3
Uyghurs in hiring practices, and provided unequal 
4
access to healthcare services. 
5
(6) The authorities of the People’s Republic of 
6
China have manipulated the strategic objectives of 
7
the international war on terror to increase their cul-
8
tural and religious oppression of the Muslim popu-
9
lation residing in the XUAR. 
10
(7) Following unrest in the region, in 2014, 
11
Chinese authorities launched their ‘‘Strike Hard 
12
against Violent Extremism’’ campaign, in which du-
13
bious threats of widespread extremist activity were 
14
used as justification for gross human rights viola-
15
tions committed against members of the Uyghur 
16
community in the XUAR. 
17
(8) Chinese authorities have made use of the 
18
legal system as a tool of repression, including for the 
19
imposition of arbitrary detentions and for torture 
20
against members of the Uyghur and other popu-
21
lations. 
22
(9) Uyghurs and Kazakhs who have secured 
23
citizenship or permanent residency outside of China

have attested to repeated threats, harassment, and 
1
surveillance by Chinese officials. 
2
(10) Reporting from international news organi-
3
zations has found that over the past decade, family 
4
members of Uyghurs living outside of China have 
5
gone missing or been detained to force their return 
6
to China or silence dissent. 
7
(11) Credible evidence from human rights orga-
8
nizations, think tanks, and journalists confirms that 
9
more than 1,000,000 Uyghurs and members of other 
10
Muslim ethnic minority groups have been imprisoned 
11
in ‘‘political reeducation’’ centers. 
12
(12) Independent accounts from former detain-
13
ees of ‘‘political reeducation’’ centers describe inhu-
14
mane conditions and treatment including forced po-
15
litical indoctrination, torture, beatings, rape, forced 
16
sterilization, and food deprivation. Former detainees 
17
also confirmed that they were told by guards the 
18
only way to secure release was to demonstrate suffi-
19
cient political loyalty. 
20
(13) News surrounding the ongoing atrocities in 
21
the XUAR and advocacy efforts to assist Uyghurs 
22
remains muted in most Muslim majority nations 
23
around the world.

(14) Both Secretary of State Antony Blinken

have stated that the Chinese government in Xinjiang 
3
has committed genocide and crimes against human-
4
ity.
