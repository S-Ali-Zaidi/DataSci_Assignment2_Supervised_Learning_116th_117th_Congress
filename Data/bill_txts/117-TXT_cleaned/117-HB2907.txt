SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
1
It is the sense of Congress that— 
2
(1) the ability of the United States to attract 
3
foreign direct investment is directly linked to the 
4
long-term economic prosperity, global competitive-
5
ness, and security of the United States; 
6
(2) it is a top national priority to enhance the 
7
global competitiveness, prosperity, and security of 
8
the United States by— 
9
(A) removing unnecessary barriers to for-
10
eign direct investment and the jobs that such 
11
investment creates throughout the United 
12
States; 
13
(B) promoting policies to ensure the 
14
United States remains the premier global des-
15
tination to invest, hire, innovate, provide serv-
16
ices and manufacture products; and 
17
(C) promoting policies to ensure the 
18
United States remains the global leader in de-
19
veloping and deploying cutting-edge tech-
20
nologies such as self-driving vehicle technology, 
21
artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, quan-
22
tum computing, blockchain, and the like; 
23
(3) maintaining the United States commitment 
24
to open investment policy encourages other countries 
25

new markets abroad for United States companies 
1
and their products; 
2
(4) while foreign direct investment can enhance 
3
the United States economic strength, policies regard-
4
ing foreign direct investment should reflect national 
5
security interests and should not disadvantage do-
6
mestic investors or companies; 
7
(5) United States efforts to attract foreign di-
8
rect investment should be consistent with efforts to 
9
maintain and improve the domestic standard of liv-
10
ing; and 
11
(6) as digital information becomes increasingly 
12
important to the United States economy and the de-
13
velopment of new technologies and services that will 
14
be crucial to the country’s competitiveness in the 
15
21st century global economy, barriers such as data 
16
localism and infringement of intellectual property 
17
rights must be addressed.
