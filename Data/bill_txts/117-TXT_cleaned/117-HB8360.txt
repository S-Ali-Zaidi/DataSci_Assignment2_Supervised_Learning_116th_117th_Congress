which the same or a similar housing unit

was readily obtainable for rental or pur-
2
chase in the same area from other sellers

during the energy emergency period.

(C) MITIGATING FACTOR.—The mitigating 
5
factor described in this subparagraph is wheth-
6
er the quantity of any housing dwelling units 
7
such person made available for rental or sale in 
8
an area covered by the proclamation during the 
9
30-day period following the date on which the 
10
proclamation was issued increased over the 
11
quantity such person made available for rental 
12
or sale during the 30-day period before the date 
13
on which the proclamation was issued, taking 
14
into account any usual seasonal demand vari-
15
ation. 
16
(b) AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE.—It shall be an affirma-
17
tive defense in any civil action or administrative action to 
18
enforce subsection (a), with respect to the renting out or

20
or sale price of such housing reasonably reflects additional 
21
costs that were paid, incurred, or reasonably anticipated 
22
by such person, or reasonably reflects additional risks 
23
taken by such person, to rent or sell such housing unit 
24
under the circumstances.
