SEC. 2. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
1
It is the policy of the United States to prioritize ef-
2
forts to control the ongoing desert locust outbreak in East 
3
Africa and other affected regions, mitigate the impacts on 
4
food security, economic productivity, and political sta-
5
bility, improve interagency coordination to prevent future 
6
outbreaks, and promote resilience in affected countries.

SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
8
Congress finds the following: 
9
(1) The United States Agency for International 
10
Development reports that countries in East Africa 
11
are currently suffering the worst desert locust out-
12
break in decades, which will devour crops and pas-
13
ture and destroy local livelihoods across the region. 
14
(2) As of December 2020, the Food and Agri-
15
culture Organization reported that there were 42 
16
million people experiencing acute food insecurity in 
17
East Africa, which numbers are projected to in-
18
crease if the desert locust outbreak is not controlled. 
19
(3) The desert locust outbreak in East Africa, 
20
particularly in Kenya, Ethiopia, and Somalia, is neg-
21
atively impacting food security, local livelihoods and 
22
economic productivity, and may threaten political 
23
stability in the region. 
24
(4) Proactive investments now to control the 
25
desert locust outbreak could reduce the need for a

much larger United States humanitarian response 
1
effort later, as well as support economic and political 
2
stability and build resilience in affected countries. 
3
(5) In order to optimize the United States re-
4
sponse to the desert locust outbreak, an interagency 
5
working group should be established to develop and 
6
implement a comprehensive, strategic plan to control 
7
the desert locust outbreak in East Africa and other 
8
affected regions, mitigate impacts on food security, 
9
economic productivity, and political stability and 
10
prevent future outbreaks.
