SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Incentives and encouragement for the con-
3
servation and appropriate handling of nutrients con-
4
tained in organic matter are necessary. 
5
(2) Biogas systems will save Federal, State, and 
6
local taxpayers money by converting waste into use-
7
ful products, such as fuel, fertilizer, thermal heat, 
8
feedstock for hydrogen fuel cells, and renewable 
9
chemicals. 
10
(3) Manure resource recovery systems will save 
11
Federal, State, and local taxpayers money by recov-
12
ering the nutrients contained in organic matter from 
13
their source, rather than recovering the nutrients 
14
after they have entered landfills or waterways.
