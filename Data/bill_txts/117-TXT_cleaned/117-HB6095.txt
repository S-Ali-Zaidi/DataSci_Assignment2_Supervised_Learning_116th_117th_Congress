SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) On August 4, 2020, one of the most power-
3
ful explosions ever to impact an urban population 
4
ripped through the Lebanese capital of Beirut. The 
5
blast—linked to 2,750 metric tons of ammonium ni-
6
trate stored in a warehouse—killed at least 220 peo-
7
ple, wounded approximately 7,000, left an estimated 
8
300,000 people homeless, and caused approximately 
9
$15,000,000,000 in property damage. 
10
(2) The COVID–19 pandemic has taken a 
11
heavy toll on Lebanon, which has recorded over 
12
628,000 cases and 8,400 deaths since the pandemic 
13
began. Lebanon’s public health system, already 
14
weakened by the Beirut disaster and political up-
15
heaval, has struggled to cope in the face of the pan-
16
demic. 
17
(3) While progress has been made towards a re-
18
turn to political normalcy, Lebanon lacked a fully 
19
formed government for much of the COVID–19 pan-
20
demic and the political establishment remains highly 
21
polarized and divided. 
22
(4) Lebanon has been experiencing one of the 
23
worst economic crises in its history at the same time 
24
as the COVID–19 pandemic, Beirut Port explosion, 
25
and political crisis.

(5) According to the United Nations, up to 78 
1
percent of the Lebanese population (3,000,000 peo-
2
ple) were living in poverty as of March 2021. 
3
(6) Per the United Nations, 36 percent of the 
4
Lebanese population (1,380,000 people) are experi-
5
encing extreme poverty. 
6
(7) Since October 2019, the Lebanese pound 
7
has lost 90 percent of its value, resulting in a year- 
8
on-year inflation rate of more than 120 percent from 
9
May 2020 to May 2021. 
10
(8) Food prices have skyrocketed, increasing 
11
400 percent in 2020 alone. 
12
(9) In July 2021, the United Nations Chil-
13
dren’s Fund (UNICEF) warned that Lebanon’s 
14
water system is on the verge of collapse, with more 
15
than 70 percent of the country facing critical water 
16
shortages. In January 2019, 1,000 Lebanese pounds 
17
bought 4 liters of water. By August 2021, it only 
18
bought half a liter. 
19
(10) Dire fuel shortages plague Lebanon, lead-
20
ing the American University of Beirut Medical Cen-
21
ter, Beirut’s top hospital and one of the leading 
22
medical centers in the region, to issue a warning in 
23
August 2021 that hundreds of patients would die if 
24

•HR 6095 IH
they failed to secure enough fuel to keep their gen-
1
erators running. 
2
(11) The combined crises have strained many of 
3
Lebanon’s public institutions to the breaking point, 
4
including the Lebanese Army, whose budget and sol-
5
diers’ salaries have been devastated by the devalu-
6
ation of the Lebanese Pound. 
7
(12) On October 14, 2021, gunmen fired on a 
8
crowd of protestors gathered near the Beirut Justice 
9
Palace sparking heavy armed clashes in nearby 
10
neighborhoods. The ensuing fighting killed at least 
11
seven individuals and wounded more than 30 others. 
12
As of October 28, 2021, 68 people have been 
13
charged with murder, attempted murder, stirring 
14
sectarian strife, possession of illicit war weapons, 
15
and destroying private and public property. 
16
(13) Tensions remain extremely high as the in-
17
vestigation into the clashes is still ongoing leading to 
18
fears of further violence and instability. 
19
(14) Numerous residents of Beirut living in the 
20
vicinity of the clashes have been quoted by domestic 
21
and international media comparing the October 14th 
22
clashes and ongoing tensions to the devastating 
23
1975–1990 Lebanese civil war, reflecting well-found-
24
04:55 Dec 09, 2021

5 
•HR 6095 IH
ed fears of the potential for a return to significant 
1
sectarian violence. 
2
(15) The United States has long stood with the 
3
Lebanese people in times of need and standing with 
4
them now is both morally right and in line with our 
5
national interests. 
6
(16) President Biden’s pledge of an additional 
7
$98,000,000 in aid to Lebanon on the first anniver-
8
sary of the Beirut Port explosion was a good first 
9
step in supporting the Lebanese people, and desig-
10
nating Lebanon for Temporary Protected Status 
11
(TPS) is the logical next step given the cir-
12
cumstances. 
13
(17) Lebanon needs significant continued inter-
14
national support to prevent the worsening of its eco-
15
nomic, social, political, and public health crises and 
16
to rebuild from this period of extraordinary difficulty 
17
for the Lebanese people. 
18
(18) A country is designated for TPS when it 
19
is determined by the United States Government that 
20
it is unsafe for its citizens to return to due to ‘‘ongo-
21
ing armed conflict’’, ‘‘environmental disaster’’, or 
22
‘‘extraordinary and temporary conditions in the for-
23
eign state that prevent aliens who are nationals of 
24
the state from returning to the state in safety’’.

(19) The combined crises facing Lebanon 
1
amount to extraordinary and temporary conditions 
2
that prevent Lebanese nationals from safely return-
3
ing to Lebanon. Any returned individual would have 
4
to contend without access to clean water, adequate 
5
healthcare, and affordable basic necessities—all in 
6
the face of the very real threat of significant political 
7
violence. After years of uncertainty, these individuals 
8
deserve stability and temporary relief in the United 
9
States.
