‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—In carrying out the 
17
activities authorized under paragraph (1), the 
18
Director shall select and establish up to four 
19
computational materials and chemistry science 
20
centers to develop open-source, robust, and vali-
21
dated computational codes and user-friendly

‘‘(B) SELECTION.—The Director shall se-
5
lect centers under paragraph (1) on a competi-
6
tive, merit-reviewed basis. The Director shall 
7
consider applications from the National Labora-
8
tories, institutes of higher education, multi-in-
9
stitutional collaborations, and other appropriate 
10
entities. 
11
‘‘(C) DURATION.—A center established 
12
under this subsection shall receive support for 
13
a period of not more than 5 years, subject to 
14
the availability of appropriations. 
15
‘‘(D) RENEWAL.—Upon the expiration of 
16
any period of support of a center under this 
17
paragraph, the Director may renew support for 
18
the center, on a merit-reviewed basis, for a pe-
19
riod of not more than 5 years.

‘‘(E) TERMINATION.—Consistent with the 
21
existing authorities of the Department, the Di-
22
rector may terminate an underperforming cen-
23
ter for cause during the performance period.
