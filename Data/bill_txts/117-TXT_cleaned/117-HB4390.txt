SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. 
1
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The 340B drug pricing program is an es-
3
sential part of the Nation’s health care safety net. 
4
(2) 340B enables safety-net providers to stretch 
5
scarce resources further to offer services and treat 
6
patients through the savings these providers receive 
7
under the program. 
8
(3) 340B savings support hospitals, clinics, and 
9
health centers’ care for patients who have low in-
10
comes, including those with low incomes enrolled in 
11
Medicare and Medicaid. 
12
(4) 340B savings are critically important to 
13
rural hospitals that operate on very slim margins 
14
and serve patients in isolated areas with limited ac-
15
cess to health care. 
16
(5) 340B supports care for those in need with-
17
out using taxpayer dollars. 
18
(6) Some commercial payers and pharmacy ben-
19
efit managers are paying less to 340B covered enti-
20
ties and their contract pharmacies for 340B drugs, 
21
requiring identification of 340B drug claims or oth-
22
erwise discriminating against 340B covered entities 
23
and their contract pharmacies on the basis of their 
24
status as providers or pharmacies that dispense 
25
340B drugs.

•HR 4390 IH
(7) These types of discriminatory actions un-
1
dermine the purpose of the 340B program and harm 
2
the patients served by 340B covered entities. Com-
3
mercial payers and pharmacy benefit managers’ im-
4
position of requirements on a 340B pharmacy be-
5
cause it is a pharmacy that dispenses 340B drugs, 
6
or requirements with respect to the use of and bill-
7
ing for drugs purchased under 340B because they 
8
are 340B drugs is inconsistent with public policy be-
9
cause of the deleterious effects on the nation’s 
10
health care safety net. 
11
(b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this Act are the fol-
12
lowing: 
13
(1) To prohibit discriminatory actions, includ-
14
ing several specified actions, by a pharmacy benefit 
15
manager, a group health plan, a health insurance 
16
issuer offering group or individual health insurance, 
17
or a sponsor of a Medicare part D prescription drug 
18
plan against 340B covered entities and their phar-
19
macies and requiring them to be treated as any 
20
other provider or pharmacy. 
21
(2) To provide for the imposition of civil mone-
22
tary penalties on pharmacy benefit managers that 
23
violate the new protections and require the Health
