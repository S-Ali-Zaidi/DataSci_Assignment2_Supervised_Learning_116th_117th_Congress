RESOLUTION 
Acknowledging that in the aftermath of September 11, 2001, 
individuals experienced hate and were targeted by the 
government on account of their faith, race, national ori-
gin and immigration status, and suggesting various 
forms of relief to support those affected. 
Whereas, on September 11, 2001, our Nation experienced the 
deadliest attacks ever perpetrated on American soil; 
Whereas nearly 3,000 people perished in the September 11, 
2001 attacks;

Whereas over 3,000 people have died from 9/11 related ill-
nesses, and many still suffer long-term, bodily trauma 
from inhaling toxic dust and rubble; 
Whereas the United States experienced immeasurable fear, 
sorrow, outrage and loss; 
Whereas Balbir Singh Sodhi, a Sikh, was murdered in Mesa, 
Arizona, on September 15, 2001; 
Whereas Waqar Hasan in Dallas, Texas, and Adel Karas in 
San Gabriel, California, were killed on September 15, 
2001; 
Whereas in the first week after the attack, community orga-
nizations documented 645 incidents of bias and hate in 
the workplace, houses of worship, schools, homes, and in 
public life against Americans perceived to be of Middle 
Eastern or South Asian descent; 
Whereas hundreds of police, fire fighters and first responders 
lost their lives in the rescue effort, including members 
from the Arab, Muslim, Middle Eastern, South Asian and 
Sikh communities; 
Whereas Arab, Muslim, Middle Eastern, South Asian, and 
Sikh communities have long experienced discrimination 
and violence in the United States, which intensified after 
the attacks; 
Whereas there was a climate of hate in which Arab, Muslim, 
Middle Eastern, South Asian, and Sikh communities ex-
perienced bullying and violence in their everyday lives 
and in their workplaces, businesses, community centers 
and houses of worship; 
Whereas the government targeted Arab, Muslim, Middle 
Eastern, South Asian and Sikh communities with over-

cies that resulted in wrongful interrogation, coercion, de-
tention, deportation, arrest, and incarceration; 
Whereas core principles like due process, presumption of in-
nocence, and evidence of wrongdoing were replaced with 
mob mentality and guilt by association; 
Whereas the fearmongering and hateful rhetoric witnessed in 
the aftermath of the attacks remain commonplace today; 
Whereas border officials and government authorities cast 
aside constitutional rights and engaged in discriminatory 
searches and seizures of Arab, Muslim, Middle Eastern, 
South Asian, and Sikh community members; 
Whereas false narratives about Arabs, Islam and American 
Muslims abound, and are encouraged and justified by a 
network of closely connected and well-funded organiza-
tions and activists that seek to propagate misinformation 
about these communities and provide support for policies 
that curtail their rights; 
Whereas the conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere, as 
well as human rights violations ranging from torture at 
Guantanamo Bay to extrajudicial drone strikes, also con-
tributed to this climate of hate and the government tar-
geting of these communities; 
Whereas Arab, Muslim, Middle Eastern, South Asian, and 
Sikh communities have experienced humiliation, stigma, 
deprivation of due process, and loss of liberty because of 
government targeting, which reinforced the climate of 
hate; 
Whereas the climate of hate and government targeting im-
pacted the ability of these communities to exercise their 
constitutionally protected rights including to organize, 
speak, travel, and worship freely;

Whereas the 2002 National Security Entry-Exit Registration 
System required men and boys as young as 16 years of 
age with temporary visas from 25 predominantly Muslim 
countries to register at local immigration offices for 
fingerprinting, photographs and invasive interviews; 
Whereas by July 2003, the National Security Entry-Exit 
Registration System slated 13,000 out of 83,000 reg-
istered men and boys for deportation, decimating entire 
communities and resulting in zero terror-related convic-
tions; 
Whereas the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Immi-
gration and Naturalization Service questioned thousands 
of Muslims who they believed might have information 
about or connections to criminal activity based on im-
proper criteria such as officer hunch or an anonymous tip 
from people wrongfully suspicious of their Muslim neigh-
bors; 
Whereas immediately after the September 11 attacks, the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation and immigration au-
thorities arrested and detained as many as 1,200 Mus-
lims, and none of these ‘‘special interest’’ detained people 
were ultimately indicted for terrorist activity; 
Whereas to this day, Joint Terrorism Task Forces, the De-
partment of Justice Racial Profiling Guidance, Preemp-
tive Prosecutions, Countering Violent Extremism Pro-
grams, Suspicious Activity Reporting, Watchlists, Fusion 
Centers, travel bans on people from Muslim and Black- 
majority countries from entering the United States, and 
other policies continue to profile and unfairly target 
Arab, Muslim, Middle Eastern, South Asian, Sikh, Black, 
and African communities;

Whereas many politicians and influential members of the gen-
eral public continue to explicitly endorse, espouse and act 
upon this hateful rhetoric and use it for their own polit-
ical benefit, including Members of Congress and State 
and local elected officials; and 
Whereas Arab, Muslim, Middle Eastern, South Asian, and 
Sikh communities have met these challenges with unwav-
ering courage, strength, compassion, and resilience, and 
united in the aftermath of 9/11 to advocate for civil and 
human rights, work which continues to this day to benefit 
all Americans: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
