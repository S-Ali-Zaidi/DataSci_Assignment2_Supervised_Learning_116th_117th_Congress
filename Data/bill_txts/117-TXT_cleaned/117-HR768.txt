RESOLUTION 
Condemning the Biden administration for incentivizing illegal 
immigration by compensating illegal migrants who cross 
the southern border illegally and for stopping construc-
tion on the southern border wall and failing to enforce 
Migrant Protection Protocols. 
Whereas the Biden administration is considering payments to 
illegal migrants that could amount to $1,000,000 a fam-
ily or up to $450,000 for each migrant; 
Whereas the Biden administration’s failed border policies 
have created the worst border crisis in 30 years;
