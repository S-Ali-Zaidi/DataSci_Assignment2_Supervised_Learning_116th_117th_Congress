RESOLUTION 
Establishing the Select Committee to Investigate the January 
6th Attack on the United States Capitol. 
Whereas January 6, 2021, was one of the darkest days of our 
democracy, during which insurrectionists attempted to 
impede Congress’s Constitutional mandate to validate the 
presidential election and launched an assault on the 
United States Capitol Complex that resulted in multiple 
deaths, physical harm to over 140 members of law en-
forcement, and terror and trauma among staff, institu-
tional employees, press, and Members; 
Whereas, on January 27, 2021, the Department of Homeland 
Security issued a National Terrorism Advisory System 
Bulletin that due to the ‘‘heightened threat environment 
across the United States,’’ in which ‘‘[S]ome ideologi-
cally-motivated violent extremists with objections to the

•HRES 503 IH 
exercise of governmental authority and the presidential 
transition, as well as other perceived grievances fueled by 
false narratives, could continue to mobilize to incite or 
commit violence.’’ The Bulletin also stated that— 
(1) ‘‘DHS is concerned these same drivers to vio-
lence will remain through early 2021 and some DVEs 
[domestic violent extremists] may be emboldened by the 
January 6, 2021 breach of the U.S. Capitol Building in 
Washington, D.C. to target elected officials and govern-
ment facilities.’’; and 
(2) ‘‘Threats of violence against critical infrastruc-
ture, including the electric, telecommunications and 
healthcare sectors, increased in 2020 with violent extrem-
ists citing misinformation and conspiracy theories about 
COVID–19 for their actions’’; 
Whereas, on September 24, 2020, Director of the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation Christopher Wray testified before 
the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of 
Representatives that— 
(1) ‘‘[T]he underlying drivers for domestic violent 
extremism – such as perceptions of government or law 
enforcement overreach, sociopolitical conditions, racism, 
anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, misogyny, and reactions to 
legislative actions – remain constant.’’; 
(2) ‘‘[W]ithin the domestic terrorism bucket cat-
egory as a whole, racially-motivated violent extremism is, 
I think, the biggest bucket within the larger group. And 
within the racially-motivated violent extremists bucket, 
people subscribing to some kind of white supremacist- 
type ideology is certainly the biggest chunk of that.’’; and 
(3) ‘‘More deaths were caused by DVEs than inter-
national terrorists in recent years. In fact, 2019 was the 
01:23 Jun 29, 2021
HR503

•HRES 503 IH 
deadliest year for domestic extremist violence since the 
Oklahoma City bombing in 1995’’; 
Whereas, on April 15, 2021, Michael Bolton, the Inspector 
General for the United States Capitol Police, testified to 
the Committee on House Administration of the House of 
Representatives that— 
(1) ‘‘The Department lacked adequate guidance for 
operational planning. USCP did not have policy and pro-
cedures in place that communicated which personnel were 
responsible for operational planning, what type of oper-
ational planning documents its personnel should prepare, 
nor when its personnel should prepare operational plan-
ning documents.’’; and 
(2) ‘‘USCP failed to disseminate relevant informa-
tion obtained from outside sources, lacked consensus on 
interpretation of threat analyses, and disseminated con-
flicting intelligence information regarding planned events 
for January 6, 2021.’’; and 
Whereas the security leadership of the Congress under-pre-
pared for the events of January 6th, with United States 
Capitol Police Inspector General Michael Bolton testi-
fying again on June 15, 2021, that— 
(1) ‘‘USCP did not have adequate policies and pro-
cedures for FRU (First Responder Unit) defining its 
overall operations. Additionally, FRU lacked resources 
and training for properly completing its mission.’’; 
(2) ‘‘The Department did not have adequate policies 
and procedures for securing ballistic helmets and vests 
strategically stored around the Capitol Complex.’’; and 
(3) ‘‘FRU did not have the proper resources to com-
plete its mission.’’: Now, therefore, be it
