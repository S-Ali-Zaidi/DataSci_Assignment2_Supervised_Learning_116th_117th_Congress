SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Congressional Over-
4
sight of Unjust Policing Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) On January 6, 2021, organized individuals 
8
violently attacked the United States Capitol while 
9
both chambers of Congress were in session, putting 
10
the lives of Members, Congressional staff, and sup-
11
port staff at risk. 
12
(2) Various media reports suggest that certain 
13
members of rank and file law enforcement officers 
14
aided and abetted individuals who breached security 
15
at the Capitol on January 6. 
16
(3) Various media reports indicate that neither 
17
the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) nor the 
18
Department of Homeland Security (DHS) conducted 
19
a risk assessment of demonstration activities, nor 
20
issued a joint department bulletin as is customary 
21
for large and notable public events. 
22
(4) Officers Brian Sicknick and Howard 
23
Liebengood died after defending the Capitol Com-

plex and protecting those serving and working there 
1
on January 6, 2021. 
2
(5) The United States Capitol Police provides 
3
limited information to the public about employee 
4
misconduct, and the Office of the Inspector General 
5
of the United States Capitol Police does not publicly 
6
disclose its reports, unlike the vast majority of other 
7
Inspectors General. 
8
(6) In recent decades, community organizers 
9
have formed social justice and criminal reform move-
10
ments to call for substantive changes in response to 
11
various incidents across the country in which law en-
12
forcement has used excessive force against civilians, 
13
often resulting in the death of those who present or 
14
identify as Black or Brown. 
15
(7) In the Nation’s Capital, and on the United 
16
States Capitol grounds, the disparate treatment of 
17
individuals is ever-present, as various Members of 
18
Congress and Congressional staff who come from 
19
communities of color have documented instances of 
20
refusal of entry and mistreatment by United States 
21
Capitol Police (USCP) officers. 
22
(8) Further, in 2013, agents from the United 
23
States Secret Service and United States Capitol Po-
24
lice shot Miriam Carey, an unarmed individual, more 
25

•HR 276 IH
than 20 times while she was in her car with her in-
1
fant, hitting Carey five times and killing her. 
2
(9) In 2018, United States Secret Service 
3
agents took Jessica Ford into custody without exces-
4
sive force, even though she intentionally rammed a 
5
White House checkpoint with a gun in her hand. 
6
(10) In 2017, during debates about Public Law 
7
115–97, United States Capitol Police officers forc-
8
ibly dragged peaceful demonstrators from the dis-
9
ability community out of wheelchairs and other sup-
10
portive medical devices. 
11
(11) In 2020, armed members of the District of 
12
Columbia National Guard were dispatched to stand 
13
guard on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial amidst 
14
peaceful protests. 
15
(12) In 2020, United States Park Police and 
16
National Guard troops forced people into unmarked 
17
vans and used tear gas and fired rubber bullets to 
18
disperse peaceful protestors for the President’s 
19
planned visit to St. John’s Episcopal Church. 
20
(13) In 2017, the FBI reported that white su-
21
premacists posed a ‘‘persistent threat of lethal vio-
22
lence’’ that has produced more fatalities than any 
23
other category of domestic terrorists since 2000. 
24
01:40 Feb 08, 2021

•HR 276 IH
(14) In 2015, the FBI’s Counterterrorism Pol-
1
icy Directive and Policy Guide warned that subjects 
2
of ‘‘domestic terrorism investigations focused on mi-
3
litia extremists, white supremacist extremists, and 
4
sovereign citizen extremists often have identified ac-
5
tive links to law enforcement officers’’. 
6
(15) A 2006 intelligence assessment, based on 
7
FBI investigations and open sources warned of 
8
‘‘white supremacist infiltration of law enforcement . 
9
. . by organized groups and by self-initiated infiltra-
10
tion by law enforcement personnel sympathetic to 
11
white supremacist causes’’. 
12
(16) Since 2000, hundreds of Federal, State, 
13
and local law enforcement officials have been caught 
14
expressing racist, nativist, and sexist views on social 
15
media.
