2
Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal and the ad hoc Amer-
3
ican and Allied military tribunals throughout the 
4
Asia Pacific from 1945 to 1951 was to obtain justice 
5
for the maltreatment of POWs. Approximately sev-
6
enty-five percent of the more than 5,600 defendants 
7
were charged with offenses against POWs. This re-
8
flects the July 26, 1945, Potsdam Declaration’s 
9
warning that, ‘‘stern justice shall be meted out to all 
10
war criminals, including those who have visited cru-
11
elties upon our prisoners’’.

(17) President Ronald Reagan first proclaimed 
13

21
many people, including prisoners of wars, those who 
22
have undergone tragic experiences in the Bataan Pe-
23

other places’’.

1
ated an annual visitation program for former United 
2
States POWs of Japan and family members to visit 
3
Japan for remembrance, reconciliation, and healing. 
4
(20) It is time to recognize the ordinary men 
5
and women who found uncommon courage in ex-
6
traordinary circumstances to fight the impossible 
7
and endure the unimaginable for freedom from tyr-
8
anny and oppression.

(21) The Congressional Gold Medal is an ap-
10
propriate way to honor the service of the United
