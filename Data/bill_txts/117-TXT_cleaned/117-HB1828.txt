A BILL 
To provide grants to States to ensure that all students in 
the middle grades are taught an academically rigorous 
curriculum with effective supports so that students com-
plete the middle grades prepared for success in secondary 
school and postsecondary endeavors, to improve State 
and local educational agency policies and programs relat-
ing to the academic achievement of students in the mid-
dle grades, to develop and implement effective middle 
grades models for struggling students, and for other 
purposes.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Success in the Middle 
4
Act of 2021’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Research shows that Federal funding for 
8
students in middle school and high school, particu-
9
larly grades 6 through 12, is significantly lower than 
10
funding for elementary and postsecondary students. 
11
(2) International comparisons indicate that stu-
12
dents in the United States do not start out behind 
13
students of other nations in mathematics and 
14
science, but that they fall behind by the end of the 
15
middle grades. 
16
(3) Approximately 66 percent of students in 
17
grade 8 read below the proficient level on the 2019 
18
National Assessment of Educational Progress. Aver-
19
age reading scores were lower at grade 8 for all ra-
20
cial/ethnic groups compared to 2017 except for 
21
Asian/Pacific Islander students. 
22
(4) In mathematics, 37 percent of students in 
23
grade 8 show skills at or above the proficient level 
24
on the 2019 National Assessment of Educational 
25
18:49 May 12, 2021
H1828

•HR 1828 IH
Progress, which is not a significant change since 
1
2017. Nationwide, 19 percent of 8th grade public 
2
school students in the Nation who took the mathe-
3
matics assessment had teachers who reported that a 
4
lack of adequate instructional materials and supplies 
5
was a moderate or serious problem. 
6
(5) Evidence demonstrates substantial learning 
7
loss for the Nation’s students, including students 
8
from the middle grades, resulting from the COVID- 
9
19 pandemic. Black and Hispanic students, in par-
10
ticular, were less likely to have access to the pre-
11
requisites of learning—devices, internet access, and 
12
live contact with teachers. Left unaddressed, these 
13
opportunity gaps could translate into wider achieve-
14
ment gaps. 
15
(6) By grade 6, a student who attends school 
16
less than 80 percent of the time, receives unsatisfac-
17
tory marks for mild but sustained misbehavior, or 
18
who fails English or mathematics, has only a 10 to 
19
20 percent chance of graduating on time. Without 
20
effective interventions and proper supports, these 
21
students are at risk of subsequent failure in sec-
22
ondary school, or of dropping out. 
23
(7) According to Gallup, student engagement is 
24
strong at the end of elementary school, with nearly 
25
18:49 May 12, 2021
H1828
4 
•HR 1828 IH
3⁄4 of 5th graders (74%) reporting high levels of en-
1
gagement. But similar surveys have shown a gradual 
2
and steady decline in engagement for older students, 
3
with approximately 1⁄2 of students in middle school 
4
reporting high levels of engagement. 
5
(8) Student transitions from elementary school 
6
to the middle grades and to secondary school are 
7
often complicated by poor curriculum alignment, in-
8
adequate counseling services, and unsatisfactory 
9
sharing of student performance and academic 
10
achievement data between grades. 
11
(9) Middle grades improvement strategies 
12
should be tailored based on a variety of performance 
13
indicators and data, so that— 
14
(A) educators can create and implement 
15
successful school improvement strategies to ad-
16
dress the needs of the middle grades; and 
17
(B) teachers can provide effective instruc-
18
tion and adequate assistance to meet the needs 
19
of at-risk students. 
20
(10) Middle grade teachers face unique chal-
21
lenges due to the increased individual subject matter 
22
focus of the curriculum combined with the physical, 
23
intellectual, and emotional changes faced by early 
24

adolescents transitioning from elementary school to

high school. 
2
(11) Combining measures of academic achieve-
3
ment and motivation, social engagement, and self- 
4
regulation—the behavioral domains essential for suc-
5
cess across the school and work continuum—pro-
6
vides a more holistic picture of students, including 
7
their likelihood of enrolling in an institution of high-
8
er education following high school graduation. This 
9
information, available in middle school, allows for 
10
early identification of and intervention with students 
11
who may be less likely to complete secondary school 
12
and attend an institution of higher education. 
13
(12) Appropriate academic accommodations, 
14
age-appropriate discipline, access to assistive tech-
15
nology, and evidence-based interventions must be 
16
used with students with disabilities, particularly in 
17
the middle grades, as— 
18
(A) the dropout rate for learning disabled 
19
students is nearly 3 times the dropout rate of 
20
all students; 
21
(B) more than half of young adults with 
22
learning disabilities have been involved in the 
23
justice system; and 
24
18:49 May 12, 2021
H1828

•HR 1828 IH
(C) students with disabilities have a grad-
1
uation rate nearly 20 percentage points lower 
2
than the graduation rate for general education 
3
students. 
4
(13) Local educational agencies and State edu-
5
cational agencies often do not have the capacity to 
6
provide support for school improvement strategies. 
7
Successful models do exist for turning around low- 
8
performing middle grades, and Federal support 
9
should be provided to increase the capacity to apply 
10
promising practices based on evidence from success-
11
ful schools.
