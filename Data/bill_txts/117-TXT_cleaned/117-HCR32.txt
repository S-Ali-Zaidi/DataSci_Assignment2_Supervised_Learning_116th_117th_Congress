CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 
Commemorating the 30th anniversary of Operation Provide 
Comfort. 
Whereas after the uprising against Saddam Hussein in 
March 1991, Hussein turned tanks and helicopter 
gunships on the defenseless citizens of Kurdistan; 
Whereas overwhelmed by the Hussein regime’s superior fire-
power, and having already experienced the genocidal 
death of some 200,000 Kurds, along with the wanton de-
struction of 4,500 Kurdish villages and deadly chemical 
bombardment, hundreds of thousands of Kurdish men, 
women, and children fled to Iraq’s northern and eastern 
borders, fearing that the regime would use poison gas 
against them, as during the Anfal campaign and in 
Halabja only 3 years before;

Whereas in the early days of this refugee crisis, the daily 
death toll of fleeing Kurds at one point exceeded 1,000, 
with victims having no time to gather any possessions or 
winter protective gear and thus succumbing to exposure, 
malnutrition, and disease; 
Whereas the United States, in response to the unfolding 
human catastrophe, led what became the largest humani-
tarian operation of its kind ever, ‘‘Operation Provide 
Comfort’’, delivering humanitarian relief and enforcing a 
no-fly zone; 
Whereas Operation Provide Comfort saved the lives of count-
less thousands of Kurds from near certain death on 
Kurdistan’s freezing and rugged border mountains; 
Whereas Kurds, to this day, credit American-led Operation 
Provide Comfort, particularly the no-fly zone that pro-
tected the Kurdish people until 2003, for the stable, 
peaceful, and welcoming environment Kurdistan is today; 
Whereas the Kurdistan Region of Iraq serves, as one of the 
world’s largest safe havens for those fleeing conflict and 
religious and political persecution; and 
Whereas the Kurdistan Regional Government and the Kurd-
ish Peshmerga remain among the most dependable and 
steadfast partners of the United States in the fight 
against extremism and terrorism: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate 
1
concurring), That Congress hereby—

(1) commemorates the 30th anniversary of Op-

eration Provide Comfort;
