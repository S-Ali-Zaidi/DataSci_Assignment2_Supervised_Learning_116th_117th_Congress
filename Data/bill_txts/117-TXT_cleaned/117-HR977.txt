RESOLUTION 
Commemorating the life and legacy of Jean-Louis de 
Ke´rouac on the centennial of his birth on March 12, 2022. 
Whereas Jean-Louis de Ke´rouac, better known as ‘‘Jack’’, 
was a giant of American literature and favorite son of 
Lowell, Massachusetts; 
Whereas, alongside Allen Ginsberg and William Burroughs, 
Jack Kerouac ignited the literary movement in the 1950s 
known as the ‘‘Beat Generation’’; 
Whereas the Beat Generation’s rebuke against traditional 
values and materialism created the foundation for subse-
quent counterculture movements in America and beyond; 
Whereas the beatnik stereotype dominated popular media and 
culture in the 1950s and 1960s, an amalgamation of 
Kerouac’s self-expressive, unconventional characters;

•HRES 977 IH 
Whereas the ‘‘Beatles’’ took their name after the movement, 
while artists such as Bob Dylan and Jim Morrison cite 
Kerouac’s work as major influences; and 
Whereas, more than half a century since his death, Kerouac’s 
novels still fire the imagination, particularly of young 
people, and serve as a tribute to their culture-changing 
origins: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives recog-
1
nizes and commemorates the enduring contribution of 
2
Jack Kerouac’s work to American literary culture and be-
3
yond on the centennial of his birth.
