•HR 9147 IH
(1) According to a United Nations estimate, ap-
1
proximately 167 criminal gangs operated in Haiti in 
2
October 2021, exerting territorial control over as 
3
much as two-thirds of the country. 
4
(2) Haitian armed criminal gangs, the most 
5
prominent of which are the G9 Family and Allies 
6
and 400 Mawozo gangs, conduct violent crimes, in-
7
cluding murder, rape, arms and drug trafficking, 
8
racketeering, kidnapping, and blockades of fuel and 
9
aid deliveries. These crimes have perpetuated the on-
10
going security and humanitarian crises in Haiti, 
11
which have worsened since the assassination of 
12
President Jovenel Moise on July 7, 2021. 
13
(3) The United Nations Office of the High 
14
Commissioner for Human Rights and the Human 
15
Rights Service jointly found a 333 percent increase 
16
in human rights violations and abuses against the 
17
rights to life and security in Haiti between July 
18
2018 and December 2019. 
19
(4) At least 19,000 Haitians were forcibly dis-
20
placed during 2021 due to rising criminal violence. 
21
(5) At least 803 kidnappings were reported in 
22
Haiti during the first 10 months of 2021, including 
23
the kidnapping of more than 16 United States citi-

zens, giving Haiti having the highest per capita kid-
1
napping rate of any country in the world. 
2
(6) There is significant evidence of collusion be-
3
tween criminal gangs and economic and political 
4
elites in Haiti, including members of the Haitian 
5
National Police, which has resulted in widespread 
6
impunity and directly contributed to Haiti’s current 
7
security crisis.

(7) On December 10, 2020, the Office of For-
9
eign Assets Control of the Department of the Treas-
10

12
Ministry of the Interior Fednel Monchery, and 
13
