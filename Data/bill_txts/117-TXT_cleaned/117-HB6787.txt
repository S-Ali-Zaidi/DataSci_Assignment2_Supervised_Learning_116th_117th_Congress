•HR 6787 IH
(1) As of February 2022, the Consumer Price 
1
Index rose 7.5 percent from one year ago, the larg-
2
est increase in 40 years. 
3
(2) Compared with 2021, the energy index rose 
4
27 percent and food costs rose 7 percent, placing an 
5
unprecedented burden on American families. 
6
(3) Shipping costs have increased year-over- 
7
year, raising the price of important groceries like 
8
milk, eggs, bread, meat, and other goods. 
9
(4) According to data from the Federal High-
10
way Administration, the average American driver 
11
drives 14,263 miles per year. A suspension of the 
12
Federal gas tax would save the average American 
13
more than $100 per year. 
14
(5) The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs 
15
Act provided $118 billion in funding from the gen-
16
eral fund to supplement the Highway Trust Fund. 
17
(6) The 18.4 cent Federal gas tax dispropor-
18
tionately impacts rural Americans, who must travel 
19
longer distances to go to the grocery store, see their 
20
doctors, go to the pharmacy to pick up their pre-
21
scriptions, or travel to their jobs or school. 
22
(7) On August 30, 2021, the Federal Trade 
23
Commission announced enhanced efforts to step up 
24
enforcement on oil and gas companies for alleged 
25

collusion that led to increased gas prices for Amer-
1
ican consumers. 
2
(8) Since 2008, Congress has transferred funds 
3
from the general fund to the Highway Trust Fund 
4
three times to ensure the fund remained solvent. 
5
(9) Oil companies reported record profits in 
6
2021 while Americans continue to struggle under 
7
high gas prices, inflation, and ongoing impacts of a 
8
pandemic. 
9
(10) The Organization of Petroleum Exporting 
10
Countries (OPEC) takes actions to control oil pro-
11
duction by considerably influencing international oil 
12
prices at the expense of American consumers. 
13
(11) A temporary gas tax holiday is one way to 
14
lower prices for American consumers as we continue 
15
to work towards long-term energy independence.
