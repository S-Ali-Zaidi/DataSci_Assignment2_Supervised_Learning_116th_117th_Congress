(2) Congress found that to earn the Medal of 
1
Honor ‘‘the deed of the person . . . must be so out-
2
standing that it clearly distinguishes his gallantry 
3
beyond the call of duty from lesser forms of brav-
4
ery’’. 
5
(3) The actions of Medal of Honor recipients 
6
inspire bravery in those currently serving in the 
7
Armed Forces and those who will come to serve in 
8
the future. 
9
(4) Those listed on the Medal of Honor Roll 
10
have come to exemplify the best traits of members 
11
of the Armed Forces, a long and proud lineage of 
12
those who went beyond the call of service to the 
13
United States of America. 
14
(5) To date the Medal of Honor has been 
15
awarded only 3,522 times, including only 145 times 
16
for the Korean War, 126 times in World War I, 23 
17
times during the Global War on Terror, and 20 
18
times for the massacre at Wounded Knee. 
19
(6) The Medal of Honor is awarded in the 
20
name of Congress. 
21
(7) As found in Senate Concurring Resolution 
22
153 of the 101st Congress, on December 29, 1890 
23
the 7th Cavalry of the United States engaged a trib-
24
al community ‘‘resulting in the tragic death and in-

jury of approximately 350–375 Indian men, women, 
1
and children’’ led by Lakota Chief Spotted Elk of 
2
the Miniconjou band at ‘‘Cankpe’ Opi Wakpa’’ or 
3
‘‘Wounded Knee Creek’’. 
4
(8) This engagement became known as the 
5
‘‘Wounded Knee Massacre’’, and took place between 
6
unarmed Native Americans and soldiers, heavily 
7
armed with standard issue army rifles as well as 
8
four ‘‘Hotchkiss guns’’ with five 37 mm barrels ca-
9
pable of firing 43 rounds per minute. 
10
(9) Nearly two-thirds of the Native Americans 
11
killed during the Massacre were unarmed women 
12
and children who were participating in a ceremony 
13
to restore their traditional homelands prior to the 
14
arrival of European settlers. 
15
(10) Poor tactical emplacement of the soldiers 
16
meant that most of the casualties suffered by the 
17
United States troops were inflicted by friendly fire. 
18
(11) On January 1st, 1891, Major General Nel-
19
son A. Miles, Commander of the Division of Mis-
20
souri, telegraphed Major General John M. Schofield, 
21
Commander-in-Chief of the Army notifying him that 
22
‘‘[I]t is stated that the disposition of four hundred 
23
soldiers and four pieces of artillery was fatally defec-
24
tive and large number of soldiers were killed and 
25

wounded by the fire from their own ranks and a very 
1
large number of women and children were killed in 
2
addition to the Indian men’’. 
3
(12) The United States awarded 20 Medals of 
4
Honor to soldiers of the U.S. 7th Cavalry following 
5
their participation in the Wounded Knee Massacre. 
6
(13) In 2001, the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, 
7
a member Tribe of the Great Sioux Nation, upon in-
8
formation provided by Lakota elders and by vet-
9
erans, passed Tribal Council Resolution No. 132–01, 
10
requesting that the Federal Government revoke the 
11
Medals of Honor from the soldiers of the United 
12
States Army, 7th Cavalry issued following the mas-
13
sacre of unarmed men, women, children, and elderly 
14
of the Great Sioux Nation on December 29, 1890, 
15
on Tribal Lands near Wounded Knee Creek. 
16
(14) The National Congress of American Indi-
17
ans requested in a 2007 Resolution that the Con-
18
gress ‘‘renounce the issuance of said medals, and/or 
19
to proclaim that the medals are null and void, given 
20
the atrocities committed upon unarmed men, women, 
21
children and elderly of the Great Sioux Nation’’. 
22
(15) General Miles contemporaneously stated 
23
that a ‘‘[w]holesale massacre occurred and I have 
24

•HR 2226 IH
never heard of a more brutal, cold-blooded massacre 
1
than that at Wounded Knee’’. 
2
(16) Allowing any Medal of Honor, the United 
3
States highest and most prestigious military decora-
4
tion, to recognize a member of the Armed Forces for 
5
distinguished service for participating in the mas-
6
sacre of hundreds of unarmed Native Americans is 
7
a disservice to the integrity of the United States and 
8
its citizens, and impinges on the integrity of the 
9
award and those who have earned the Medal since.
