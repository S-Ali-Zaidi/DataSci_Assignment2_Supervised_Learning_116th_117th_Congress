RESOLUTION 
Commending the actions of Cuban human rights and democ-
racy activist Jose´ Daniel Ferrer Garcia, and all pro- 
democracy and human rights activists, in demanding fun-
damental civil liberties in Cuba and speaking out against 
Cuba’s brutal, totalitarian Communist regime. 
Whereas, on July 11, 2021, protestors in more than 40 cities 
marched in the streets of Cuba to exercise their funda-
mental right to peacefully assemble and express their op-
position to the Cuban regime, resulting in the largest 
anti-government demonstration on the island in decades; 
Whereas the Cuban protestors, in a clear message— 
(1) called for an end to communism, censorship, and 
oppression in Cuba; and

(2) demanded basic human rights and their God- 
given freedom; 
Whereas, during the July 2021 protests, in a crude and sav-
age effort to silence the Cuban people, the Communist 
party— 
(1) deployed a wave of terror throughout Cuba by 
unleashing its secret police and military forces on the 
peaceful protestors; 
(2) harassed and threatened men, women, and chil-
dren, some of whom were in their homes; 
(3) abducted and tortured civil society leaders; and 
(4) detained more than 1,300 Cubans, according to 
media reports; 
Whereas Felix Navarro Rodriguez, a renowned pro-democracy 
activist who was arrested during the ‘‘Black Spring’’ of 
2003, is the President of the Pedro Luis Boitel Abraham 
Democracy Party, and is a member of the Executive Sec-
retariat of the Democratic Action Unity Table (MUAD), 
was arrested, then charged with the alleged crime of ‘‘at-
tack and public disorder’’, after merely appearing at a 
police unit in Cuba to inquire about the status of mem-
bers of his group who were detained during the July 11 
protest; 
Whereas, in August 2021, Felix Navarro Rodriguez, in pro-
test of his unlawful arrest, the terrible conditions in 
which he was being held and the cruelty he suffered in 
prison, went on a hunger strike for 30 days, remains iso-
lated, is in a delicate state of health, and is restricted 
from communicating with his family; 
Whereas Jose´ Daniel Ferrer Garcia, leader of the Patriotic 
Union of Cuba (UNPACU), is a Cuban human rights

and democracy activist, who has worked incessantly to 
promote fundamental civil liberties for the Cuban people; 
Whereas Jose´ Daniel Ferrer Garcia, who was born in 
Santiago de Cuba on July 29, 1970, has dedicated most 
of his adult life in peaceful protest against Cuba’s brutal 
and totalitarian Communist dictatorship to ensure that 
Cubans are allowed to have a voice in matters concerning 
their own country; 
Whereas Jose´ Daniel Ferrer Garcia was among the hundreds 
of activists who were unlawfully detained by the Cuban 
regime and has been unjustly imprisoned in isolation for 
nearly 180 days, where he has been subjected to physical 
and psychological torture by the brutal Communist 
Cuban regime; 
Whereas, according to Jose´ Daniel Ferrer Garcia’s family, his 
health is dire, he is suffering from severe headaches, 
mouth bleeding, malnutrition, bouts of coughing, and the 
inability to sleep, all of which was caused by the cruel 
torture and inhumane treatment he received from the 
Cuban regime; 
Whereas a host of other pro-democracy activists have been 
imprisoned solely for peacefully exercising their rights to 
freedom of expression, including Ciro Alexis Casanovas 
Pe´rez, Loreto Herna´ndez Garcı´a and wife, Donaida Pe´rez 
Paseiro, Didier Eduardo Almagro Toledo, Nidia Bienes 
Paseiro, Demis Valde´s Sarduy, Misael Dı´az Paseiro, 
Arianna Lo´pez Roque, twin sisters Lisdani Rodrı´guez 
Isaac and Lisdiani Rodrı´guez Isaac, and Ivan Hernandez 
Carrillo; 
Whereas, during the week of Christmas 2021, many of these 
peaceful demonstrators were convicted on charges of sedi-

tion and sentenced to decades in prison just for demand-
ing basic human rights; and 
Whereas the totalitarian regime is terrified of brave and cou-
rageous leaders who stand resolute in fighting for a free 
Cuba, and will persecute, kidnap, torture, or kill anyone 
who stands up against their tyranny: Now, therefore, be 
it
