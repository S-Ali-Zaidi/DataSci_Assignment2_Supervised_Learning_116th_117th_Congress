Congress finds the following:

•HR 2640 IH
(1) Labor unions make significant political con-
1
tributions and expenditures that directly or indi-
2
rectly influence the election of candidates and sup-
3
port or oppose political causes. Decisions to use 
4
union dues for political contributions and expendi-
5
tures are usually made by union leadership and 
6
management, rather than union membership. 
7
(2) Unions, acting through their management, 
8
should be obligated to conduct business in the best 
9
interests of their membership. 
10
(3) Historically, union members have not had a 
11
way to know, or to influence, the political activities 
12
of unions that are supposed to represent them. 
13
Union members and the public have a right to know 
14
how unions are spending members’ dues to make po-
15
litical contributions or expenditures benefitting can-
16
didates, political parties, and political causes. 
17
(4) Unions should be accountable to their mem-
18
bership in making political contributions or expendi-
19
tures affecting Federal governance and public policy. 
20
Requiring the express approval of a union’s member-
21
ship for political contributions or expenditures will 
22
establish necessary accountability.
