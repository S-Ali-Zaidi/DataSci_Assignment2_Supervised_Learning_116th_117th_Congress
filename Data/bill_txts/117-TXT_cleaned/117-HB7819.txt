A BILL 
To amend the Communications Decency Act to remove im-
munity for online firearms marketplaces, and for other 
purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Accountability for On-
4
line Firearms Marketplaces Act of 2022’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) The core purpose of section 230 of the 
8
Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 230) (com-

•HR 7819 IH
monly known as the ‘‘Communications Decency 
1
Act’’) (referred to in this section as ‘‘Section 230’’) 
2
is to provide a specific protection for online plat-
3
forms acting as Good Samaritans to stop online 
4
abuse. Specifically, Section 230 states that providers 
5
of interactive computer services will not be treated 
6
as publishers or speakers of user-generated content. 
7
In turn, the provision entrusted providers to act as 
8
Good Samaritans police their platforms by blocking 
9
and screening offensive content. 
10
(2) Section 230 bars actions that hold providers 
11
liable as publishers of third-party content, but the 
12
statute is irrelevant to claims unrelated to such pub-
13
lications. If a claim does not treat the defendant as 
14
a publisher, Section 230 should not apply. 
15
(3) However, courts have interpreted Section 
16
230 as providing sweeping immunity for a broad 
17
array of providers, including providers alleged to 
18
have facilitated violations of criminal laws online. 
19
This interpretation is overly broad and discourages 
20
the self-policing that Section 230 intended to 
21
incentivize. 
22
(4) In Daniel v. Armslist, the Wisconsin Su-
23
preme Court read Section 230 to bar claims against 
24
an online firearms marketplace. The court’s decision

swept so broadly as to cover websites designed to en-
1
courage and facilitate firearms trafficking in viola-
2
tion of chapter 44 of title 18, United States Code. 
3
(5) Online firearms marketplaces have made it 
4
increasingly easy for people who are prohibited from 
5
gun ownership to purchase guns online. Online fire-
6
arms marketplaces facilitate such sales because 
7
while Federal law requires licensed gun dealers to 
8
perform background checks on prospective buyers, it 
9
does not require unlicensed sellers to do so. For 
10
more than a decade, online firearms marketplaces 
11
have exploited this legal loophole by allowing unli-
12
censed sellers to sell guns directly to people prohib-
13
ited from gun ownership. 
14
(6) Every year, unlicensed sellers post more 
15
than 1,000,000 advertisements on online firearms 
16
marketplaces in States that do not legally require a 
17
background check. Individuals with criminal his-
18
tories and other prohibited purchasers rely on these 
19
postings to evade basic background check laws and 
20
procure firearms. One study found that nearly 1 in 
21
9 prospective gun buyers who respond to advertise-
22
ments from unlicensed sellers on a major online fire-
23
arms marketplace would not pass a background 
24
check, which is a rate that is 7 times higher than 
25

the denial rate in contexts where background checks 
1
are required. 
2
(7) Congress did not intend for Section 230 to 
3
bar otherwise valid claims against online firearms 
4
marketplaces for their own design of a website that 
5
encourages and contributes to its users circum-
6
venting Federal laws, including Federal gun laws.

(B) by adding at the end the following:
