(1) only two-thirds indicated they knew where to 
seek mental health resources on campus; 
(2) less than half indicated they felt comfortable 
seeking mental health support on campus; and 
(3) just over half reported they knew how to help a

ence issues including stress, eating disorders, burnout, 
depression, and anxiety which in the most severe cases if 
left untreated may lead to suicide or suicidal ideation;

seek counseling and other professional help services;

tributes to student athletes not seeking needed care or 
vocalizing their mental health concerns to parents, peers, 
and coaches; 
Whereas student athletes experience unique stressors, includ-
ing expectations to perform and achieve in sports on top 
of their academic requirements; 
Whereas coaches and support staff are mentors to student 
athletes, and their knowledge of stigmatizing language 
and mental health services and resources can make a dif-
ference in the lives of athletes; 
Whereas prominent athletes have forgone competitions to ad-
dress their mental health needs; 
Whereas mental health and physical health are equally impor-
tant components of overall health; 
Whereas better publicly available data is needed to track the 
mental health of student athletes, including the rate of 
suicide among this demographic; and
