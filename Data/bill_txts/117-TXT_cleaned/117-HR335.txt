RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the designation of May as Ehlers- 
Danlos Syndrome Awareness Month to increase the 
knowledge of this little-known, potentially fatal, genetic 
disease. 
Whereas Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome represents multiple genetic 
disorders involving mutations in connective tissue that 
are characterized by looseness, instability, and dislocation 
of the joints and fragile skin that easily bruises and 
scars; 
Whereas there are 13 types of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome 
caused by genetic defects in collagen, one of the major 
structural components of the body; 
Whereas it is estimated that the prevalence of all types of the 
syndrome affect at least 1 in 5,000 people worldwide;

Whereas a network of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome support 
groups can help connect those managing life with the dis-
ease as well as better inform the health care community 
and the public; 
Whereas early and accurate diagnosis can provide the oppor-
tunity to create lifesaving medical plans and ensure the 
quality of life; 
Whereas there is currently no treatment for Ehlers-Danlos 
Syndrome and no known cure; 
Whereas further medical research and awareness bring hope 
for treatment and a cure; and 
Whereas the month of May would be an appropriate month 
to designate as Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome Awareness 
Month: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the designation of Ehlers-Danlos 
2
Syndrome Awareness Month; 
3
(2) honors those bravely suffering from Ehlers- 
4
Danlos Syndrome; and 
5
(3) encourages scientific research and funding 
6
to find a cure for Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome.
