SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds that— 
2
(1) following a major disaster declared by the 
3
President under section 401 of the Robert T. Staf-
4
ford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act 
5
(42 U.S.C. 5170), the subset of communities that 
6
are most impacted and distressed as a result of the 
7
disaster face critical social, economic, and environ-
8
mental obstacles to recovery, including insufficient 
9
public and private resources to address disaster-re-
10
lated housing and community development needs for 
11
lower income households and distressed commu-
12
nities; 
13
(2) unmet disaster recovery needs, including 
14
housing assistance needs, can be especially wide-
15
spread among persons with extremely low, low, and 
16
moderate incomes; 
17
(3) economic, social, and housing hardships 
18
that affect communities before disasters are exacer-
19
bated during crises and can delay and complicate 
20
long-term recovery, especially after catastrophic 
21
major disasters; 
22
(4) States, units of local government, and In-
23
dian Tribes within the most impacted and distressed 
24
areas resulting from major disasters benefit from 
25
flexibility to design programs that meet local needs,

but face inadequate financial, technical, and staffing

capacity to plan and carry out sustained recovery, 
2
restoration, and mitigation activities; 
3
(5) the speed and effectiveness considerations of 
4
long-term recovery from catastrophic major disasters 
5
is improved by predictable investments that support 
6
disaster relief, long-term recovery, restoration of

housing and infrastructure, and economic revitaliza-

11
fects of future natural disasters and extreme weath-
12
er and increase the stock of affordable housing, in-
13
cluding affordable rental housing, as part of long- 
14
term recovery can significantly reduce future fiscal 
15
and social costs, especially within high-risk areas, 
16
and can help to address outstanding housing and 
17
community development needs by creating jobs and 
18
providing other economic and social benefits within 
19
