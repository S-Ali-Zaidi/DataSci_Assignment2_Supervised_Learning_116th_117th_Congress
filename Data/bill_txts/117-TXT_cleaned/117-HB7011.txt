SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) According to the Centers for Disease Con-
3
trol and Prevention— 
4
(A) in the United States, 1 in 169 births 
5
are affected by stillbirth each year amounting 
6
to 23,500 stillbirths annually, of which 6,900 of 
7
these are Black or African-American stillbirths; 
8
(B) the number of stillbirths each year is 
9
greater than the number of babies that die dur-
10
ing the first year of life; 
11
(C) annual stillbirths are more than ten 
12
times the number of annual deaths due to Sud-
13
den Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS); 
14
(D) stillbirth occurs across all demo-
15
graphics and in otherwise healthy pregnancies. 
16
It is most common, however, among women 
17
who— 
18
(i) are Black or African American, at 
19
two times more likely than White women 
20
to have a stillbirth; 
21
(ii) are of lower socioeconomic status; 
22
(iii) are diagnosed with high blood 
23
pressure, diabetes, obesity, or other med-
24
ical conditions; 
25
(iv) are 35 years of age or older;

(v) smoke cigarettes while pregnant; 
1
(vi) have previously experienced preg-
2
nancy loss; or 
3
(vii) have multiple pregnancies, for ex-
4
ample triplets; and 
5
(E) while the rate of stillbirth has declined 
6
since the 1940s due to improvements in mater-
7
nity care, in recent years, the decline has 
8
slowed or halted. 
9
(2) According to a study by researcher Wall- 
10
Wieler et al., published in Obstetrics and Gyne-
11
cology, ‘‘the risk of severe maternal morbidity 
12
among stillbirth deliveries was more than fourfold 
13
higher compared with live birth deliveries’’. 
14
(3) According to a study by researcher McClure 
15
et al., published in the International Journal of Gyn-
16
ecology and Obstetrics, ‘‘stillbirth was significantly 
17
associated with maternal mortality’’. 
18
(4) According to a review article by Murphy 
19
and Cacciatore, published in Seminars in Fetal & 
20
Neonatal Medicine, stillbirth has psychological im-
21
pacts on parents like grief, shame, and guilt and im-
22
pacts to family functioning and well-being.

(5) Stillbirth, and the disparity in those im-
1
pacted by stillbirth requires further research, sup-
2
port, and prevention programming.
