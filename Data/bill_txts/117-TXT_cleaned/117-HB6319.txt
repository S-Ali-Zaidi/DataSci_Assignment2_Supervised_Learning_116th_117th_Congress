A BILL 
To provide for the imposition of sanctions with respect to 
forced organ harvesting within the People’s Republic of 
China, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Falun Gong Protection

Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 6319 IH
(1) Falun Gong is a spiritual practice in the 
1
Buddhist tradition that espouses the principles of 
2
truthfulness, compassion, and forbearance. The 
3
practice was introduced in China by Mr. Li Hongzhi 
4
in 1992 and aims to improve physical, psychological, 
5
and spiritual well-being through exercise, meditation, 
6
and moral improvement. 
7
(2) On July 20, 1999, after years of escalating 
8
harassment by the government, then-General Sec-
9
retary Jiang Zemin launched an intensive, nation-
10
wide persecution designed to eradicate Falun Gong. 
11
Since then, the People’s Republic of China (PRC) 
12
has detained hundreds of thousands of Falun Gong 
13
practitioners. 
14
(3) In its 2020 Report on International Reli-
15
gious Freedom, released on May 12, 2021, the De-
16
partment of State stated in its entry on China, 
17
‘‘Prior to the government’s 1999 ban on Falun 
18
Gong, the government estimated there were 70 mil-
19
lion adherents. Falun Gong sources estimate tens of 
20
millions continue to practice privately, and Freedom 
21
House estimates seven to 20 million practitioners.’’. 
22
(4) Freedom House in its Freedom in the 
23
World 2021 report entry on China stated that ‘‘the 
24
regime’s campaign to eradicate the Falun Gong spir-
25

itual group continued in 2020. Hundreds of Falun 
1
Gong practitioners have received long prison terms 
2
in recent years, and many others are arbitrarily de-
3
tained in various ‘legal education’ facilities. Detain-
4
ees typically face torture aimed at forcing them to 
5
abandon their beliefs, sometimes resulting in deaths 
6
in custody.’’. 
7
(5) In its 2021 report, the United States Com-
8
mission on International Religious Freedom stated 
9
in its key findings for China, ‘‘according to reports, 
10
thousands of Falun Gong practitioners were har-
11
assed and arrested during 2020 for practicing their 
12
faith, and some likely died due to abuse and torture 
13
while in custody. Credible international reports also 
14
suggested that organ harvesting, including from 
15
Falun Gong practitioners, likely continued.’’. 
16
(6) The widespread, systematic, state-sponsored 
17
persecution of the Falun Gong by the Chinese Com-
18
munist Party leadership of the PRC constitutes a 
19
clear violation of Falun Gong practitioners’ basic 
20
human rights and may constitute genocide. 
21
(7) The campaign against Falun Gong is over-
22
seen by central branches of the Chinese Communist 
23
Party, including the so-called ‘‘Central Leading 
24
Group on Preventing and Dealing with Heretical Re-
25

ligions’’. On May 12, 2021, Yu Hui, a former Office 
1
Director of this group, was targeted for sanctions by 
2
the United States Government. 
3
(8) Reports, such as those mentioned in this 
4
legislation, suggest that China’s organ transplan-
5
tation system does not comply with the majority of 
6
the World Health Organization’s Guiding Principles 
7
on Human Cell, Tissue and Organ Transplantation, 
8
insofar as organs are said to be primarily sourced 
9
from prisoners without voluntary consent, organs are 
10
reported to be traded for payment, the level of trans-
11
parency and traceability in the organ procurement 
12
process is low, and the Chinese Communist Party 
13
has prevented independent or impartial inspection, 
14
scrutiny and verification of its transplant system. 
15
(9) On June 14, 2021, a joint statement by 
16
United Nations human rights experts expressed ex-
17
treme alarm over ‘‘reports of alleged ‘organ har-
18
vesting’ targeting minorities, including Falun Gong 
19
practitioners, Uyghurs, Tibetans, Muslims, and 
20
Christians in detention in China’’. 
21
(10) Based on independent research and official 
22
statistics, it is clear that many organ transplants 
23
conducted in the PRC do not meet internationally 
24
accepted ethical standards. 
25

•HR 6319 IH
(11) Freedom House in its Freedom in the 
1
World 2021 report entry on China stated that ‘‘The 
2
government claims it has ended the transplantation 
3
of organs from executed prisoners. However, the 
4
scale of the transplantation industry and the speed 
5
with which some organs are procured far exceed 
6
what is feasible via the country’s nascent voluntary 
7
donation system and there is growing international 
8
attention to possible crimes against humanity in con-
9
nection with the practice.’’. 
10
(12) A 2019 forensic statistical analysis of 
11
organ donation data in the PRC, published in the 
12
BMC Medical Ethics journal, concluded the fol-
13
lowing: ‘‘China’s apparent systematic falsification of 
14
national organ donation data severely undermines 
15
the good faith efforts being made to integrate China 
16
into the international transplantation community.’’. 
17
(13) The United States had approximately 145 
18
million registered organ donors in 2019: 19,257 per-
19
sons donated their organs, resulting in 39,719 trans-
20
plants; the ratio of actual donors to registered do-
21
nors is approximately 0.00013. Similar ratios are 
22
observed in the United Kingdom, Canada and other 
23
countries. By contrast, the PRC claimed to have 
24
more than 900,000 registered organ donors by early 
25
19:41 Dec 27, 2021
H6319

•HR 6319 IH
2019; data from China also indicates 5,818 organ 
1
donors and 19,454 transplants in 2019, resulting in 
2
a ratio of actual donors to registered donors of 
3
0.0057. Although this comparison does not control 
4
for other possible variables, the fact that China’s 
5
nascent organ donation program yielded 44 times 
6
more organ donors from its organ donation pool 
7
than that of the United States in 2019 merits inter-
8
national scrutiny. 
9
(14) Credible evidence suggests that Falun 
10
Gong practitioners are subject to widespread forced 
11
organ harvesting and are specifically targeted for 
12
this barbaric practice. 
13
(15) In January of 2007, Canadian human 
14
rights attorney David Matas and former Canadian 
15
Secretary of State for the Asia Pacific region David 
16
Kilgour published findings confirming the likelihood 
17
that forced organ harvesting of Falun Gong practi-
18
tioners was occurring in China. They also concluded 
19
that there was no evidence of a voluntary donation 
20
system in the PRC at the time and that, in spite of 
21
this, the Chinese Government reported a dramatic 
22
escalation in its organ transplantation infrastructure 
23
(a three-fold increase) between 1999 and 2004, par-
24
allel to the onset of the persecution of Falun Gong. 
25
19:41 Dec 27, 2021
H6319
7 
•HR 6319 IH
(16) In 2016, Matas, Kilgour, and investigative 
1
journalist Ethan Gutmann published an exhaustive 
2
report concluding that it is likely that between 
3
60,000 and 100,000 organ transplants had been 
4
conducted per year since 2000, and that Falun Gong 
5
practitioners are the main source of organs for 
6
transplant in China. 
7
(17) In its annual report for 2020, the Con-
8
gressional-Executive Commission on China ref-
9
erenced reports raising concerns about the PRC fal-
10
sifying organ donation data, casting additional doubt 
11
on the CCP’s claim to have ended forced organ har-
12
vesting. 
13
(18) On March 1, 2020, the Independent Tri-
14
bunal into Forced Organ Harvesting from Prisoners 
15
of Conscience in China, an investigative entity 
16
known as a people’s tribunal commissioned by the 
17
International Coalition to End Transplant Abuse in 
18
China, composed of relevant legal, cultural, and 
19
medical experts and led by Sir Geoffrey Nice, re-
20
leased its final judgment, including— 
21
(A) very large numbers of transplant oper-
22
ations have been carried out in the PRC. The 
23
Tribunal assessed as credible the numbers of 
24
operations being between 60,000 and 90,000

annually in the years 2000 to 2014. The num-
1
ber of eligible registered donors was reportedly 
2
5,146 in 2017, leaving an incomprehensible 
3
gap; 
4
(B) ‘‘Forced organ harvesting has been 
5
committed for years throughout China on a sig-
6
nificant scale and that Falun Gong practi-
7
tioners have been one—and probably the 
8
main—source of organ supply’’; 
9
(C) ‘‘Falun Gong practitioners in detention 
10
were systematically subjected to blood tests and 
11
organ examinations’’ while other prisoners were 
12
not tested, suggesting that Falun Gong practi-
13
tioners were specifically selected or targeted for 
14
these medical examinations; and 
15
(D) ‘‘. . . the PRC and its leaders actively 
16
incited the persecution, the imprisonment, mur-
17
der, torture and the humiliation of Falun Gong 
18
practitioners with the sole purpose of elimi-
19
nating the practice of, and belief in, the value 
20
of Falun Gong.’’. 
21
(19) The international nongovernmental organi-
22
zation Doctors Against Forced Organ Harvesting 
23
presented a petition with over three million signa-
24
tures collected worldwide between 2012 to 2018 to

the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
1
Rights, calling for an investigation into forced organ 
2
harvesting of Falun Gong that went unheeded. 
3
(20) In June 2016, the House of Representa-
4
tives passed its fifth resolution condemning China’s 
5
persecution of Falun Gong with H. Res. 343 114, 
6
‘‘Expressing concern regarding persistent and cred-
7
ible reports of systematic, state-sanctioned organ 
8

9
science in the People’s Republic of China, including 
10
from large numbers of Falun Gong practitioners and 
11
members of other religious and ethnic minority

groups’’ and calling for an end to the ‘‘eradication’’ 
13
campaign of Falun Gong and forced organ har-
14

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
16
It is the sense of Congress that— 
17
(1) killing a human being through involuntary 
18
organ extraction is an egregious violation of uni-
19
versal standards of medical ethics and is in direct 
20
contradiction of basic standards of human decency; 
21
(2) the forced harvesting of organs violates Ar-
22
ticle 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human 
23
Rights, which states that ‘‘Everyone has the right to 
24
life, liberty and security of person.’’, and Article 4, 
25
19:41 Dec 27, 2021

10 
•HR 6319 IH
which states that ‘‘No one shall be held in slavery 
1
or servitude.’’; 
2
(3) the United Nations Human Rights Council 
3
should issue a formal condemnation of the People’s 
4
Republic of China (PRC) for its persecution of 
5
Falun Gong; 
6
(4) any collaboration with or participation in 
7
the PRC’s organ transplant system by the United 
8
States Government or a United States person or or-
9
ganization presents serious ethical challenges that 
10
would jeopardize the integrity of the United States 
11
organ transplantation system; and 
12
(5) the Chinese Communist Party’s state-spon-
13
sored persecution of Falun Gong must come to an 
14
immediate end. 
15
SEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
16
It is the policy of the United States to— 
17
(1) avoid any cooperation with the PRC in the 
18
organ transplantation field while the Chinese Com-
19
munist Party remains in power; 
20
(2) take appropriate measures, including using 
21
relevant sanctions authorities, to coerce the Chinese 
22
Communist Party to end any state-sponsored organ 
23
harvesting campaign; and
