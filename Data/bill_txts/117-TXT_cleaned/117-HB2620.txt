securities markets and to the participation of retail 
1
investors in those markets. 
2
(2) Issuers, brokers, dealers, and investment 
3
advisers hold powerful advantages over investors, 
4
and mandatory arbitration clauses, including con-
5
tracts that force investors to submit claims to arbi-
6
tration or to waive the right of investors to partici-
7
pate in a class action lawsuit, leverage those advan-
8
tages to severely restrict the ability of defrauded in-
9
vestors to seek redress. 
10
(3) Investors should be free to— 
11
(A) choose arbitration to resolve disputes if 
12
they judge that arbitration truly offers them 
13
the best opportunity to efficiently and fairly set-
14
tle disputes; and 
15
(B) pursue remedies in court should they 
16
view that option as superior to arbitration.
