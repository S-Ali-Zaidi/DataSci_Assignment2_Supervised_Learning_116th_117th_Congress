RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the United States should formally withdraw from the 
Paris Agreement. 
Whereas President Obama unilaterally accepted the Paris 
Agreement in August 2016 under the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change, rather than 
ratifying it as a treaty with the advice and consent of the 
Senate, a requirement stated in article II, section 2 of 
the Constitution; 
Whereas the agreement entered into force on November 4, 
2016;

Whereas, on June 1, 2017, President Trump announced that 
the United States would cease all implementation of the 
Paris Agreement; 
Whereas, on January 20, 2021, President Biden followed 
President Obama’s precedent by unilaterally rejoining the 
Paris Agreement without congressional consent; 
Whereas in addition to the United States having entered into 
the agreement without congressional approval, burden-
some regulatory measures will put the United States at 
a competitive disadvantage, costing American jobs and 
increasing energy costs for consumers and taxpayers; 
Whereas according to one report, implementing policies to 
comply with the Paris Agreement will increase electricity 
costs for a family of 4 between 13 and 20 percent annu-
ally; 
Whereas a cost-benefit analysis was not conducted at the 
time of commitments, and subsequent reports have found 
that meeting the commitments agreed to could cost the 
United States GDP $250,000,000,000 and 2,700,000 
jobs by 2025; 
Whereas all 28 European Union countries are falling short of 
their commitments under the Paris Agreement, and 
meanwhile, the world’s worst emitters, China, Russia, 
and India, are exempted from its requirements; 
Whereas according to the International Energy Agency, the 
United States has seen the largest absolute decline in 
emissions among all countries since 2000; 
Whereas a recent study showed that the Paris Agreement will 
not have any meaningful impact on climate change, re-
ducing global average temperatures by just 0.086°F in 
2100;

•HRES 113 IH 
Whereas the United States is pioneering environmental pro-
tection without international interference, is a world lead-
er at reducing pollutants known to cause immediate harm 
to humans, and is ranked number one in the world for 
clean water, according to the World Health Organiza-
tion’s airborne particulate matter standards and the En-
vironmental Protection Agency; and 
Whereas instead of binding the United States to international 
agreements that put Americans at a national security 
and economic disadvantage to its competitors abroad, the 
United States should be focused on continuing to reduce 
emissions, developing and exporting clean energy tech-
nologies, and making its communities more resilient, all 
while ensuring affordable, reliable energy prices and 
prioritizing the consumer, American security, and pros-
perity: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the United States should formally re-
1
submit its notification to withdraw from the Paris Agree-

ment.
