years less than women, and American Indian/Alaska Na-
tive and African-American men have the lowest life ex-
pectancy; 
Whereas heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and unintentional in-

men in 2 age groups, from ages 1 through 19 and ages 
20 through 44; 
Whereas men on average experience a heart attack 7 years 
earlier than women; 
Whereas testicular cancer is one of the most common cancers 
in men between the ages of 15 and 34, and when de-
tected early, has a 95-percent survival rate; 
Whereas, according to the American Cancer Society, the 
number of colorectal cancer cases among men is expected 
to be over 80,000 in 2022, and over 28,320 men are ex-
pected to die from it; 
Whereas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, 13 out of every 100 American men will de-
velop prostate cancer during their lifetime; 
Whereas, according to the American Cancer Society, an esti-
mated 268,490 men will be diagnosed with prostate can-
cer in 2022, and an estimated 34,500 of them will die 
from the disease; 
Whereas African-American men in the United States have the 
highest incidence of prostate cancer; 
Whereas African-American men are 1.7 times more likely to 
be diagnosed with, and 2.1 times more likely to die from, 
prostate cancer than White men; 
Whereas significant numbers of predominantly male-related 
health problems, such as prostate cancer, testicular can-
cer, infertility, and colon cancer, could be detected and 
treated in the early stages if men were more widely aware 
of the many early detection and screening tools and pre-
ventive measures currently available;

Whereas educating both the public and health care providers 
about the importance of early detection of male health 
problems will result in reducing rates of mortality for 
these diseases; 
Whereas appropriate use of tests such as prostate-specific 
antigen (PSA) exams and blood pressure and cholesterol 
screens, in conjunction with clinical examination and self- 
testing for problems such as testicular cancer, can result 
in the detection of many of these problems in their early 
stages and increases in the survival rates to nearly 100 
percent; 
Whereas, according to the 2019 Cleveland Clinic MENtion It 
Survey, two-thirds (65 percent) of men tend to wait as 
long as possible to see their doctor if they have any 
health symptoms or an injury, and among men surveyed, 
men ages 35 to 54 are more likely to agree they tend to 
tough it out as long as possible before going to the doctor 
(72 percent), compared to men 55 and up (59 percent); 
Whereas women are twice as likely as men to visit the doctor 
for annual examinations and preventive services; 
Whereas men are less likely than women to visit their health 
center or physician for regular screening examinations of 
male-related problems for a variety of reasons, including 
fear of learning or confirming health status or condition, 
embarrassment, lack of health insurance, lack of informa-
tion, and high out-of-pockets costs; 
Whereas ‘‘National Men’s Health Week’’ was established by 
Congress and first celebrated in 1994 and urges men and 
their families to engage in appropriate health behaviors, 
and the resulting increased awareness has improved 
health-related education and helped prevent illness;

been celebrated each June by hundreds of States, cities, 
localities, public health departments, health care entities, 
churches, and community organizations throughout the 
Nation that promote health awareness events focused on 
men and families; 
Whereas the ‘‘National Men’s Health Week’’ website has 
been established at www.menshealthmonth.org and fea-
tures proclamations from Governors and mayors, and

Whereas men who are educated about the value that preven-
tive health care can play in prolonging their lifespan and 
their role as productive family members will be more like-
ly to participate in health screenings; 
Whereas men and their families are encouraged to increase 
their awareness of the importance of a healthy lifestyle, 
regular exercise, and medical checkups; and 
Whereas June 13 through June 19, 2022, is ‘‘National Men’s

aging early detection and treatment of disease among
