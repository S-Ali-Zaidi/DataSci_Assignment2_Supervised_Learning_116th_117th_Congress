SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
The Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) On December 8, 1941, the United States 
3
declared war against the Empire of Japan, followed 
4
by declarations of war against Germany and Italy on 
5
December 11, 1941. In 1935, there were fewer than 
6
600 U.S. Army Nurses and 1,700 U.S. Navy Nurses 
7
on active duty. By the time World War II ended, 
8
more than 59,000 Army Nurses and 14,000 Navy 
9
Nurses had volunteered to serve. 
10
(2) The Army Reorganization Act of 1920 
11
granted women in the Nurse Corps ‘‘relative rank’’. 
12
This gave them the right to wear the military insig-
13
nia, but did not confer military status or privileges. 
14
This arrangement meant women serving throughout 
15
WWII received 50 percent of the pay as compared 
16
to their male counterparts, and none of the veteran 
17
benefits. Because they did not receive military sta-
18
tus, they received no orientation or training before 
19
being deployed to hospitals near the frontlines. 
20
(3) Nurses served under fire in field hospitals 
21
and evacuation hospitals across six continents, on 
22
hospital trains and ships, and as flight nurses on 
23
medical transport planes. Several nurses were killed 
24
in action when their ships were torpedoed or field 
25
hospitals were bombed. Some even entered into com-
26

bat areas as flight nurses to retrieve the wounded, 
1
and 2 groups were captured as prisoners of war by 
2
the Japanese. 
3
(4) General Douglas MacArthur ordered Army 
4
Nurses to the Bataan Peninsula to prepare 2 emer-
5
gency hospitals for U.S. and Filipino forces. General 
6
Hospital 1 received casualties directly from the front 
7
lines, and more than 1,200 battle casualties requir-
8
ing major surgery were admitted within a month. 
9
General Hospital 2 accepted patients strong enough 
10
for evacuation, as it was out in the open, with no 
11
tents or buildings, and only tree canopy to conceal 
12
them from Japanese aircraft. Hospital 1 was 
13
bombed on March 29, 1942, killing or wounding 
14
more than 100 patients, but the nurses carried on 
15
with their duties as well as they were able. Following 
16
the U.S. Army surrender of the Philippines to the 
17
Japanese on May 6, 1942, 67 Army Nurses were 
18
taken to Santo Tomas Internment Camp in Manila, 
19
where they remained until February 1945. During 
20
the 37 months in captivity, these women endured 
21
primitive conditions and starvation rations, but con-
22
tinued to care for the ill and injured in the intern-
23
ment camp hospital.

(5) Early in the morning of November 8, 1942, 
1
60 nurses attached to the 48th Surgical Hospital 
2
landed off the coast of North Africa. The nurses 
3
wore helmets and carried full packs containing med-
4
ical equipment. Without weapons, they waded ashore 
5
amid enemy sniper fire and ultimately took shelter 
6
in an abandoned civilian hospital, where they began 
7
caring for invasion casualties. There was no elec-
8
tricity or running water, and the only medical sup-
9
plies available were those the nurses had brought 
10
themselves. 
11
(6) In Anzio, Italy, nurses dug foxholes outside 
12
their tents or under their cots and cared for patients 
13
under German shellfire. The field hospital tents were 
14
marked by large red crosses and were sometimes de-
15
liberately hit with artillery shells and bombs. On 
16
February 7, 1944, a German pilot being pursued by 
17
British fighter planes dropped 5 antipersonnel 
18
bombs on the hospital, destroying 29 ward tents, 
19
killing 26 and wounding 64. The dead included 3 
20
nurses, 2 medical officers, a Red Cross worker, 14 
21
enlisted men and 6 patients. Troops came to refer 
22
to the hospital area as ‘‘Hell’s Half-Acre’’ because it 
23
was hit so frequently by enemy fire. At least 200 
24
23:31 May 18, 2022

•HR 7759 IH
nurses took part in the Anzio campaign, caring for 
1
more than 33,000 patients behind enemy lines. 
2
(7) Enlisted nurses acclimated quickly to dif-
3
ficult and dangerous conditions with a minimum of 
4
complaints, and were essential members of the field 
5
armies. 
6
(8) The presence of nurses at the front im-
7
proved morale because soldiers realized that they 
8
would receive skilled care in the event they were 
9
wounded. 
10
(9) Thanks largely to the efforts of these 
11
nurses, fewer than 4 percent of the American sol-
12
diers who received medical care in the field or under-
13
went evacuation died from wounds or disease. 
14
(10) After the war, broad public health mis-
15
sions required that enlisted nurses supervise commu-
16
nicable disease measures as former enemy countries 
17
were reorganized. In Hiroshima, these officers cared 
18
for victims of the atomic bombs. In Munich, they 
19
prevented mass epidemic in refugee camps. Enlisted 
20
nurses even provided prenatal, infant, and mental 
21
health care in other former-enemy territories. 
22
(11) Nurses received 1,619 medals, citations, 
23
and commendations during the war, reflecting the 
24
courage and dedication of all who served. Sixteen 
25

•HR 7759 IH
medals were awarded posthumously to nurses who 
1
died as a result of enemy fire, including 6 nurses 
2
who died at Anzio, 6 who died when the Hospital 
3
Ship Comfort was attacked by a Japanese suicide 
4
plane, and 4 flight nurses. Thirteen other flight 
5
nurses died in weather-related crashes while on duty. 
6
(12) In 1944, Congress passed a bill that 
7
granted Army and Navy Nurses actual military rank 
8
and benefits, approved for the duration of the war 
9
plus 6 months. 
10
(13) In 1947, Congress passed legislation estab-
11
lishing a permanent Army and Navy Nursing Corps 
12
and gave members permanent officer status with 
13
equal pay and the same benefits as those given to 
14
male officers. 
15
(14) In 1948, all military branches were inte-
16
grated and female doctors were finally admitted to 
17
the Army Medical Corps. 
18
(15) Although African-American Nurses were 
19
fully qualified and prepared to serve as nurses at the 
20
onset of World War II, racial segregation and dis-
21
crimination made it difficult for Black women to join 
22
the ranks of the Army Nurse Corps (referred to in 
23
this Act as the ‘‘ANC’’). 
24
23:31 May 18, 2022

•HR 7759 IH
(16) As the ANC began expanding its recruit-
1
ing process, thousands of Black nurses who wanted 
2
to serve their country filled out applications. 
3
(17) While the Army did eventually integrate 
4
African-American Nurses in 1941, it did so 
5
unwillingly and placed a quota on the number of Af-
6
rican-American Nurses that they would accept, cap-
7
ping the number allowed to join at 56. 
8
(18) Many of them had hardship tours and 
9
were sent to segregated camps to take care of Afri-
10
can-American Soldiers and would rotate and allow 
11
White nurses reprieve in taking care of German 
12
13
nurses allowed to enlist remained low, although the 
14
quota was officially lifted in July 1944. 
15
(19) The extraordinary efforts of these women 
16
are deserving of belated official recognition. 
17
(20) The United States is eternally grateful to 
18
the nurses of the Army and Navy Nurse Corps for 
19
their bravery and dedication to their patients 
20
through World War II, which saved lives and made 
21
significant contributions to the defeat of the Axis 
22
powers.
