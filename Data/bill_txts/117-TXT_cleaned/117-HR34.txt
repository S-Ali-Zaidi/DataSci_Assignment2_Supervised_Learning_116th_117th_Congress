In his conduct of the office of President of the United

States—in violation of his constitutional oath to faithfully

execute the office of President of the United States and,

to the best of his ability, preserve, protect, and defend the 
7
Constitution of the United States, and in violation of his 
8
constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully

10
Presidency in an attempt to circumvent and subvert the 
11
rule of law by inciting an insurrection against the Govern-
12
ment of the United States of America, in that: 
13
In a pattern of conduct attempting to create an insur-
14
rection against the Government of the United States, Don-
15
ald J. Trump spread disinformation and allegations un-
16
supported by any evidence regarding voter fraud in the 
17
2020 United States Presidential election and the results 
18
of the 2020 United States Presidential election, and ex-
19
plicitly encouraged his supporters to descend on Wash-
20
ington, DC, on January 6, 2021, while Congress engaged 
21
in its constitutionally mandated legislative business of cer-
22
tifying the electoral college results of the 2020 United 
23
States Presidential election.

Prior to January 6, 2021, Donald J. Trump told 
25
white supremacists to ‘‘stand back and stand by’’, an ap-

peal to white supremacy consistent with his prior remarks 
1
and conduct, including an August 31, 2020, statement in 
2
defense of an extremist charged with murdering peaceful 
3
protestors and an August 15, 2017, statement defending 
4
white supremacists who had committed violence in Char-
5
lottesville, Virginia, as ‘‘very fine people’’. On December 
6
20, 2020, Donald J. Trump stated that the January 6, 
7
2021, show of force he purposefully incited would be 
8
‘‘wild’’. 
9
On January 6, 2021, Donald J. Trump explicitly told 
10
his supporters to ‘‘fight like hell’’, and ‘‘you’ll never take 
11
back our country with weakness. You have to show 
12
strength.’’. Shortly thereafter, those same supporters en-
13
gaged in mass riots and insurrection on the grounds of 
14
the United States Capitol, leading to the breach and de-
15
struction of the Capitol building while Congress was in 
16
session conducting legislative business, as well as the 
17
death of at least five individuals, including a Capitol Police 
18
officer. The siege of the United States Capitol at the 
19
hands of Donald J. Trump created widespread terror, 
20
threatened the lives of members of the United States Con-
21
gress, completely disrupted legislative business, threatened 
22
the continuity of government, and exposed the United 
23
States to grave national security risks.

In a pattern of conduct dedicated to corrupting the 
1
electoral process, Donald J. Trump solicited a foreign gov-
2
ernment, Ukraine, to intervene in the 2020 United States 
3
Presidential election by requesting that the Government 
4
of Ukraine publicly announce baseless investigations into 
5
his political rival to the benefit of his potential reelection. 
6
Donald J. Trump sought to ensure such investigations by 
7
conditioning United States Government support and acts 
8
of value on the acquiescence of the Government of Ukraine 
9
to Donald J. Trump’s demands. In so doing, Donald J. 
10
Trump abused the power of the Presidency by subverting 
11
the rule of law in a manner that undermined national se-
12
curity and violated his duties to preserve, protect, and de-
13
fend the Constitution. 
14
Following the results of the 2020 United States Pres-
15
idential election, in a January 2, 2021, discussion between 
16
Donald J. Trump and Georgia State officials, Donald J. 
17
Trump solicited the assistance of the Georgia Secretary 
18
of State in overturning the free and fair election results 
19
in the State of Georgia, stating that ‘‘I just want to find 
20
11,780 votes, which is one more than we have’’. When the 
21
Georgia Secretary of State did not agree to his demands, 
22
Donald J. Trump threatened the Georgia officials with 
23
criminal prosecution if they didn’t comply, stating that 
24
leaving the vote counts intact would be a ‘‘big risk’’.

Further, during the 2016 United States Presidential 
1
election, Donald J. Trump approved and directed a sur-
2
reptitious and unlawful payment of substantial sums of 
3
money to obtain the silence of persons with unfavorable 
4
information about him in order to influence the 2016 
5
United States Presidential election.

In all of this, Donald J. Trump has undermined the 
7
integrity of his office, has betrayed his trust as President, 
8
has acted in a manner which threatens the integrity and 
9
security of the United States Government and its people, 
10
has subverted the Constitution of the United States, the 
11
democratic process, and the rule of law and justice, has 
12
purposefully and maliciously corrupted public faith and 
13
trust in the electoral process, and has behaved in a man-
14
ner grossly incompatible with the office of the President 
15
of the United States to the manifest injury of the people

of the United States.

II, section 1, clause 7 of the Constitution, has accepted 
3
emoluments from foreign states without the consent of 
4
Congress and has received and accepted emoluments from 
5
the United States and from individual States, and in doing 
6
so, Donald J. Trump has run afoul of anticorruption pro-
7
visions of the United States Constitution, in that: 
8
In attempts to leverage the office of the President 
9
of the United States for personal profit, Donald J. Trump 
10
solicited and received from foreign governments presents 
11
and emoluments, designed to curry favor and to influence 
12
him. To facilitate his receipt of emoluments from foreign 
13
states, Donald J. Trump has failed to divest his ownership 
14
stakes in, or meaningfully separate himself from, the 
15
Trump Organization’s vast network of business holdings, 
16
which engage with foreign governments. Through those 
17
business holdings, Donald J. Trump has received, and 
18
continues to receive, presents and emoluments, either di-
19
rectly or indirectly, from foreign governments. His receipt 
20
of presents and emoluments from foreign states creates 
21
both a conflict of interest between his personal business 
22
interests and his responsibilities as President of the 
23
United States, and an appearance that he is beholden to 
24
the foreign states from which he received the emoluments.

Donald J. Trump has failed to disclose to Congress, 
1
or the public, the full extent of the presents or emoluments 
2
he has received from foreign states through his business 
3
interests, thereby violating his constitutional responsibility 
4
to obtain congressional consent to obtain such emoluments 
5
as required by article I, section 9, clause 8. 
6
Further, Donald J. Trump’s receipt of emoluments 
7
and additional payments—including from lease agree-
8
ments, other rental property agreements such as that with 
9
the General Services Administration for the Trump Inter-
10
national Hotel in Washington, DC, and payments from 
11
Federal agencies such as the United States Secret Serv-
12
ice—from the United States and from individual States 
13
beyond his salary directly violates article II, section 1, 
14
clause 7 of the United States Constitution, which prohibits 
15
the President from receiving benefits, monetary or other-
16
wise, from the Federal Government, State governments, 
17
local governments, or their instrumentalities beyond the 
18
fixed Presidential compensation.

In all of this, Donald J. Trump has used the power

of his office for improper personal gain, has abused and

exceeded the lawful powers of his office, has undermined
