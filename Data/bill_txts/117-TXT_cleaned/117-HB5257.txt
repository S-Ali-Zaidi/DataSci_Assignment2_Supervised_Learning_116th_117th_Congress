(1) approximately 25 percent of adults in the 
1
United States do not own a computer;

number of students forced to share a computer with 
7
another member of their household, potentially forc-
8
ing the household to choose between important on-

line activities such as work and learning; 
10
(4) for those households without a computer or 
11
tablet, most cannot afford one; and

among high-income households, 40 percent of low-in-
