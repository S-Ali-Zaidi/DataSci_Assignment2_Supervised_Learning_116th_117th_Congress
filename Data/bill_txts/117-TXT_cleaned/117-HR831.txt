committed to democracy and the collective defense of its 
members;

Whereas democracies across the alliance face external threats 
from authoritarian regimes such as Russia and China 
and internal threats from proponents of illiberalism; 
Whereas there is a broad agreement within the alliance of the 
need to strengthen the democracies of NATO members, 
partners, and aspirant countries; 
Whereas, in April 2020, NATO Secretary General Jens 
Stoltenberg appointed an independent Reflection Group 
tasked with supporting a forward-looking reflection proc-
ess meant to strengthen the political dimension of the al-
liance; 
Whereas the Reflection Group’s report, ‘‘NATO 2030: United 
for a New Era’’, included analyses and recommendations 
for the alliance to address ‘‘ ‘democratic recession,’ the 
global erosion of democratic norms, and the rise of 
authoritarianism’’, including— 
(1) ‘‘A shared democratic identity is what distin-
guishes the Alliance from the principal threats and chal-
lenges it faces.’’; 
(2) ‘‘NATO should reassert its core identity as an 
Alliance rooted in the principles of democracy.’’; 
(3) ‘‘Any commitment to strengthening NATO’s po-
litical cohesion therefore has to be orientated toward 
those shared values and ideals, grounded in democracy, 
rule of law and individual liberty.’’; and 
(4) recommending the establishment of a Center of 
Excellence for Democratic Resilience in order to strength-
en NATO democracies against external threats; 
Whereas the Brussels Summit Communique´ issued by the

liance in history. It guarantees the security of our terri-
tory and our one billion citizens, our freedom, and the 
values we share, including individual liberty, human 
rights, democracy, and the rule of law.’’; 
(2) ‘‘State and non-state actors challenge the rules- 
based international order and seek to undermine democ-
racy across the globe.’’; and 
(3) ‘‘We reaffirm the Alliance’s shared democratic 
principles as well as our commitment to the spirit and 
the letter of the North Atlantic Treaty.’’; 
Whereas in Brussels the Allies also committed to updating 
NATO’s Strategic Concept; 
Whereas NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has reit-
erated that one of the primary purposes of updating the 
Strategic Concept must be a recommitment to the found-
ing values of the alliance; 
Whereas the NATO Parliamentary Assembly supports a new 
Strategic Concept that reaffirms that the support and 
strengthening of democratic institutions is foundational 
to the collective security of Allies; and 
Whereas the NATO Parliamentary Assembly has endorsed

Democratic Resilience within NATO headquarters for the

mocracy, human rights, and the rule of law and facili-
tating democracy and governance assistance to member, 
partner, and aspirant states, when requested: Now, there-
fore, be it
