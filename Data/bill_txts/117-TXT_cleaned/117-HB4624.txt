11
MENT FOR OFFICE OF CONNECTED CARE OF 
12
DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS. 
13
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following find-
14
ings: 
15
(1) The COVID–19 pandemic caused the De-
16
partment of Veterans Affairs to exponentially in-
17
crease telehealth and virtual care modalities, includ-
18
ing VA Video Connect, to deliver health care services 
19
to veteran patients. 
20
(2) Between January 2020 and January 2021, 
21
the number of telehealth appointments offered by 
22
the Department increased by 1,831 percent. 
23
(3) The Department maintains strategic part-
24
nerships, such as the Digital Divide Consult, with a 
25
00:58 Aug 05, 2021
H4624
30 
•HR 4624 IH
goal of ensuring veterans who reside in rural, highly 
1
rural, or medically underserved areas have access to 
2
high-quality telehealth services offered by the De-
3
partment. 
4
(4) As of 2019, veterans who reside in rural 
5
and highly rural areas make up approximately 1⁄3 of 
6
veteran enrollees in the patient enrollment system, 
7
and are on average, older than their veteran peers 
8
in urban areas, experience higher degrees of finan-
9
cial instability, and live with a greater number of 
10
complex health needs and comorbidities. 
11
(5) The Federal Communications Commission 
12
estimated in 2020 that 15 percent of veteran house-
13
holds do not have an internet connection. 
14
(6) Under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and 
15
Economic Security Act (Public Law 116–136), Con-
16
gress granted the Department additional authority 
17
to enter into short-term agreements or contracts 
18
with private sector telecommunications companies to 
19
provide certain broadband services for the purposes 
20
of providing expanded mental health services to iso-
21
lated veterans through telehealth or VA Video Con-
22
nect during a public health emergency. 
23
01:00 Aug 06, 2021
H4624
31 
•HR 4624 IH
(7) The authority described in paragraph (6) 
1
was not utilized to the fullest extent by the Depart-
2
ment. 
3
(8) Though the Department has made signifi-
4
cant progress in expanding telehealth services of-
5
fered to veterans who are enrolled in the patient en-
6
rollment system, significant gaps still exist to ensure 
7
all veterans receive equal and high-quality access to 
8
virtual care. 
9
(9) Questions regarding the efficacy of using 
10
telehealth for certain health care services and speci-
11
alities remain, and should be further studied. 
12
(10) The Department continues to expand tele-
13
health and virtual care offerings for primary care, 
14
mental health care, specialty care, urgent care, and 
15
even remote intensive care units. 
16
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
17
gress that the telehealth services offered by the Depart-
18
ment of Veterans Affairs should be routinely measured 
19
and evaluated to ensure the telehealth technologies and 
20
modalities delivered to veteran patients to treat a wide va-
21
riety of health conditions are as effective as in-person 
22
treatment for primary care, mental health care, and other 
23
forms of specialty care.

9
(1) Although section 161 of the VA MISSION

Act of 2018 (Public Law 115–182; 132 Stat. 1438) 
11
expanded the program of comprehensive assistance 
12

DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS PRO-

VIDING EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENTS FOR

THE DIAGNOSIS OF TREATMENT-RESISTANT 
6
DEPRESSION. 
7
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following find-
8
ings: 
9
(1) A systematic review in 2019 of the econom-
10
ics and quality of life relating to treatment-resistant 
11
depression summarized that major depressive dis-
12
order (in this subsection referred to as ‘‘MDD’’) is 
13
a global public health concern and that treatment- 
14
resistant depression in particular represents a key 
15
unmet need. The findings of that review highlighted 
16
the need for improved therapies for treatment-resist-
17
ant depression to reduce disease burden, lower med-
18
ical costs, and improve the quality of life of patients. 
19
(2) The Clinical Practice Guideline for the 
20
Management of MDD (in this subsection referred to 
21
as the ‘‘CPG’’) developed jointly by the Department 
22
of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense 
23
defines treatment-resistant depression as at least 
24

47 
•HR 4624 IH
two adequate treatment trials and lack of full re-
1
sponse to each. 
2
(3) The CPG recommends electro-convulsive 
3
therapy (in this subsection referred to as ‘‘ECT’’) as 
4
a treatment strategy for patients who have failed 
5
multiple other treatment strategies. 
6
(4) The CPG recommends offering repetitive 
7
transcranial magnetic stimulation (in this subsection 
8
referred to as ‘‘rTMS’’), an intervention that is indi-
9
cated by the Food and Drug Administration, for 
10
treatment during a major depressive episode in pa-
11
tients with treatment-resistant MDD. 
12
(5) The final report of the Creating Options for 
13
Veterans’ Expedited Recovery Commission (com-
14
monly referred to as the ‘‘COVER Commission’’) es-
15
tablished under section 931 of the Jason Simcakoski 
16
Memorial and Promise Act (title IX of Public Law 
17
114–198; 38 U.S.C. 1701 note) found that treat-
18
ment-resistant depression is a major issue through-
19
out the mental health treatment system, and that an 
20
estimated 50 percent of depressed patients are inad-
21
equately treated by available interventions. 
22
(6) The COVER Commission also reported data 
23
collected from the Department of Veterans Affairs 
24
that found that only approximately 1,166 patients 
25

throughout the Department were referred for ECT
