Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1

Congress finds the following:

•HR 4779 IH
(1) Direct support professionals play a critical 
1
role in the care provided to children and adults with 
2
intellectual and developmental disabilities. 
3
(2) Providers of home- and community-based 
4
services are experiencing difficulty hiring and retain-
5
ing direct support professionals, with a national 
6
turnover rate of 45 percent as identified in a 2016 
7
study by the National Core Indicators. 
8
(3) High turnover rates can lead to instability 
9
for individuals receiving services, and this may result 
10
in individuals not receiving enough personalized care 
11
to help them reach their goals for independent liv-
12
ing. 
13
(4) A discrete occupational category for direct 
14
support professionals will help States and the Fed-
15
eral Government— 
16
(A) better interpret the shortage in the 
17
labor market of direct support professionals; 
18
and 
19
(B) collect data on the high turnover rate 
20
of direct support professionals. 
21
(5) The Standard Occupational Classification 
22
system is designed and maintained solely for statis-
23
tical purposes, and is used by Federal statistical 
24
agencies to classify workers and jobs into occupa-
25

tional categories for the purpose of collecting, calcu-
1
lating, analyzing, or disseminating data. 
2
(6) Occupations in the Standard Occupational 
3
Classification system are classified based on work 
4
performed and, in some cases, on the skills, edu-
5
cation, or training needed to perform the work. 
6
(7) Establishing a discrete occupational cat-
7
egory for direct support professionals will— 
8
(A) correct an inaccurate representation in 
9
the Standard Occupational Classification sys-
10
tem; 
11
(B) recognize these professionals for the 
12
critical and often times overlooked work that 
13
they perform for the disabled community, which 
14
work is different than the work of a home 
15
health aide or a personal care aide; and 
16
(C) better align the Standard Occupational 
17
Classification system with related classification 
18
systems.
