RESOLUTION 
Honoring the lives and legacies of the ‘‘Radium Girls’’. 
Whereas Marie and Pierre Curie discovered radium in 1898, 
sparking a craze for radium-infused consumer goods in 
the early 20th century; 
Whereas many entrepreneurs touted radium’s supposedly lim-
itless curative properties, even as some scientists began 
to report serious health hazards associated with the ele-
ment; 
Whereas the ‘‘Radium Girls’’ were teenaged girls and young 
women who, starting in 1917, worked in United States 
factories painting watch dials and airplane instruments 
using glow-in-the-dark, radium-infused paint;

Whereas the early Radium Girls painted watches and instru-
ments that United States troops relied on during World 
War I; 
Whereas the majority of the Radium Girls worked for cor-
porations located in Orange, New Jersey, Ottawa, Illi-
nois, and Waterbury, Connecticut; 
Whereas the Radium Girls primarily came from working-class 
backgrounds and some were first- and second-generation 
Americans; 
Whereas, in several instances, the radium corporations’ lead-
ership knew that the element could be harmful to human 
health, but they did not inform the Radium Girls of the 
risks or implement basic safety standards; 
Whereas, in many cases, the radium corporations’ manage-
ment encouraged the Radium Girls to keep their paint-
brush tips moist and as fine as possible by putting the 
paint-covered brushes between their lips, a technique 
known as ‘‘lip-pointing’’; 
Whereas, due to lip-pointing, many of the early Radium Girls 
ingested extremely harmful quantities of radium; 
Whereas the Radium Girls breathed in radium-infused dust 
and touched radium-infused paint, and they often glowed 
by the end of the workday due to the radioactive paint 
on their clothes and skin; 
Whereas many of the Radium Girls began to experience mys-
terious health problems, including necrosis (rotting) of 
the jaw, cancer, anemia, bone fractures, and infertility; 
Whereas many of the Radium Girls were eventually plagued 
by debilitating physical pain and severe disabilities;

Whereas an unknown number of the approximately 4,000 Ra-
dium Girls died prematurely or experienced the dev-
astating health effects of radium poisoning; 
Whereas some physicians and dentists initially dismissed the 
Radium Girls’ hypothesis that their illnesses were linked 
to their occupations; 
Whereas, in some cases, the radium corporations conspired 
with members of the medical community to conceal the 
origins of the Radium Girls’ illnesses and smear their 
reputations; 
Whereas a number of the Radium Girls, in different States, 
fought to secure justice for themselves, their families, and 
their colleagues by suing the radium corporations; 
Whereas the Radium Girls’ difficult and prolonged legal bat-
tles and often horrific medical conditions drew national 
attention; 
Whereas some of the Radium Girls who challenged the ra-
dium corporations were shunned by their communities for 
harming the reputation of a prominent local employer; 
Whereas many of the surviving Radium Girls volunteered to 
participate in scientific studies on the effects of radium 
on the human body; 
Whereas investigations of the Radium Girls’ illnesses led to 
the creation of the new scientific field of human 
radiobiology; 
Whereas the Federal Government relied on data from the Ra-
dium Girls’ cases to develop safety standards for radium 
and other radioactive materials for factory workers, med-
ical personnel, and scientists, including the workers and 
scientists of the Manhattan Project;

Whereas some of the Radium Girls and their families received 
either no compensation or only meager compensation re-
lated to their harmful exposure to radium and their con-
tributions to science; 
Whereas the Radium Girls’ highly publicized case was among 
the first in which the courts held an employer responsible 
for the safety and health of its workers; 
Whereas the Radium Girls’ struggle for justice was a turning 
point in the movement to protect workers’ safety and ul-
timately spurred Congress to enact critical occupational 
health reforms; and 
Whereas many workers in the United States today are still 
fighting for a safe and equitable workplace: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) honors the Radium Girls and their deter-
2
mination to seek justice in the face of overwhelming 
3
obstacles; 
4
(2) recognizes the invaluable contributions of 
5
the Radium Girls to developing modern workplace 
6
safety laws and standards; and 
7
(3) reaffirms the commitment of the Federal 
8
Government to protecting the health and safety of 
9
all workers in the United States.
