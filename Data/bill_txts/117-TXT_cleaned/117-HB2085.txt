A BILL 
To amend title 18, United States Code, with respect to 
civil forfeitures relating to certain seized animals. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Help Extract Animals 
4
from Red Tape Act of 2021’’ or the ‘‘HEART Act of 
5
2021’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
7
Congress finds the following: 
8
(1) Animal fighting is one of the most heinous 
9
forms of animal cruelty.

(2) Federal law prohibits sponsoring, exhibiting, 
1
or attending an animal fight, causing an individual 
2
under the age of 16 to attend an animal fight, using 
3
the postal service for promoting an animal fighting 
4
venture, as well as the interstate commerce in ani-
5
mal fighting paraphilia and animals for the partici-
6
pation in animal fights. 
7
(3) Animal fighting is often associated with 
8
other forms of criminal activity including illegal 
9
gambling, drug trafficking, and domestic violence. 
10
(4) In order to rescue animals from further cru-
11
elty, provide needed veterinary care, and protect 
12
communities, Federal agencies often seize animals 
13
suspected of being used in animal fighting ventures. 
14
(5) Federal agencies tasked with enforcing the 
15
Federal animal fighting statutes often lack the infra-
16
structure and expertise to hold animals after seizure 
17
and instead partner with animal welfare organiza-
18
tions and local animal shelters to hold animals until 
19
the final judgement of the seizure cases. 
20
(6) The significant length of time animals are 
21
held before courts determine their disposition can re-
22
sult in serious physical and behavioral deterioration 
23
due to chronic stress, even when shelters provide 
24
high quality care.

(7) Federal animal fighting cases often involve 
1
dozens, if not hundreds of seized animals. 
2
(8) Between 2016 and 2019, the United States 
3
Department of Justice seized over 1,000 dogs in ani-
4
mal fighting cases. 
5
(9) Holding times for animals seized in Federal 
6
animal fighting cases can stretch on for over a year. 
7
After 64 dogs were seized from twelve locations in 
8
a Federal animal fighting case in 2016, some ani-
9
mals were held for up to 436 days. 
10
(10) Seizing 367 dogs in a Federal animal 
11
fighting case in 2013 required sheltering dogs for up 
12
to 390 days. Fifty-three percent of the dogs in that 
13
case declined behaviorally, with 30 percent of them 
14
deteriorating to such a degree that they had to be 
15
humanely euthanized. 
16
(11) Reducing the time that seized animals 
17
must be held before courts determine their legal dis-
18
position is the best way to minimize the trauma ani-
19
mals have experienced at the hands of their abusers. 
20
(12) The unique nature of animals compared to 
21
other seized assets requires higher costs to the gov-
22
ernment and to partnering animal welfare organiza-
23
tions.

(13) Animal welfare organizations have shel-
1
tered animals for several Federal investigations at 
2
costs ranging from $900,000 to more than $3 mil-
3
lion. 
4
(14) Uncertainty regarding who is ultimately 
5
responsible for the cost of care for the seized ani-
6
mals discourages future animal fighting investiga-
7
tions, which means fewer animals saved. 
8
(15) Expediting the disposition process for ani-
9
mals seized in Federal animal fighting cases will 
10
provide better outcomes for animals, reduce financial 
11
burdens on animal welfare organizations partnering 
12
with Federal agencies, and will provide more space 
13
in shelters for other animals in need.
