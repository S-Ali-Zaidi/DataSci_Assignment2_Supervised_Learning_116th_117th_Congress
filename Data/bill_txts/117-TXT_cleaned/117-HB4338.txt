ING GRANTS.

(a) IN GENERAL.—The amount of a grant awarded 
21
for an eligible workforce development program or post-sec-
22

23
mined by the Secretary, in consultation with the Board, 
24

03:46 Jul 23, 2021
H4338

•HR 4338 IH
(1) The program’s impact on participant earn-
1
ings or participant graduation and degree comple-
2
tion rates relative to costs (as determined under 
3
guidance issued pursuant to subsection (b)). 
4
(2) Whether the program was evaluated 
5
through a randomized control experimental study, a 
6
quasi-experimental study, or a correlational study, 
7
and the overall quality of the evidence behind the 
8
program, including the sample size and number of 
9
evaluations, the statistical quality of the evaluations, 
10
the magnitude of the impacts detected, and the 
11
strength of the causal connection between the pro-
12
gram and key economic outcomes measured. 
13
(3) The number of additional participants that 
14
the program expects to enroll as a result of receiving 
15
such grant. 
16
(4) Whether the program has been dem-
17
onstrated to improve equity, in particular for popu-
18
lations of individuals or communities (which may in-
19
clude rural communities) historically held furthest 
20
from opportunity. 
21
(b) IMPACT RELATIVE TO COSTS STANDARD.—The 
22
Board shall devise and publish a minimum impact relative 
23
to costs standard comparing the impact on worker earn-
24
ings or student graduation and degree completion rates

•HR 4338 IH
as a result of an eligible workforce development program 
1
or post-secondary education program and the annual cost 
2
per participant under such program. Such standard 
3
shall— 
4
(1) set forth a minimum required demonstrable 
5
increase in earnings or graduation and degree com-
6
pletion rates over time (based on previous evalua-
7
tions) per dollar of program cost per participant;

(2) allow for additional flexibility for programs 
10
that specifically or primarily serve individuals with

SEC. 4. INDEPENDENT BOARD. 
19
(a) ESTABLISHMENT OF INDEPENDENT BOARD.— 
20

ferred to as the ‘‘Board’’) consisting of 5 members ap-
22
pointed by the Secretary in accordance with subsection (c).

•HR 4338 IH
Secretary with respect to the awarding of such grants. The 
1
Board shall, in their recommendation to the Secretary re-
2
garding program selection, prioritize programs that have 
3
demonstrated a larger impact relative to costs (as deter-
4
mined under guidance issued pursuant to subsection (b)), 
5
that have been evaluated by more well-designed and well- 
6
implemented studies, and that have been evaluated by ran-
7
domized control experimental studies rather than quasi- 
8
experimental studies or correlational studies. The Board 
9
shall, in their recommendation to the Secretary regarding 
10
grant size, prioritize higher funding levels to programs 
11
that have demonstrated a larger impact relative to costs 
12
(as so determined), that have been evaluated by more well- 
13
designed and well-implemented studies, that have been 
14
evaluated by randomized control experimental studies 
15
rather than quasi-experimental studies or correlational 
16
studies, and that expect to enroll more participants as a 
17
result of receiving such grant. For the purposes of these 
18
recommendations, the Board shall devise a quality stand-
19
ard for evaluations to determine which evaluations are 
20
more well-designed and well-implemented compared to 
21
others. 
22
(c) APPOINTMENT.—The Secretary shall appoint in-
23
dividuals to serve on the Board who meet the qualifica-
24

2
Partnerships established under section 2057 of the Social 
3
Security Act.

(d) QUALIFICATIONS OF MEMBERS.—An individual 
5
who meets the qualifications described in this subsection 
6
is an individual who is an academic, nonprofit, or execu-
7

10
vidual shall— 
11
(1) be an expert in program evaluation and evi-
12
dence-based policy, including evaluation methodolo-
13
gies that are appropriately rigorous and reliant upon 
14
independent data; 
15
(2) have relevant professional or personal expe-
16
rience in a field related to one or more of the out-
17
comes listed in this division; or

19
ence with underserved communities and under- 
20
resourced families that this Act is intended to serve. 
21
(e) STAFFING.—In administering the program under 
22
this Act, the Secretary may hire such staff as necessary, 
23
including by using placement authorities under the Inter-
24
governmental Personnel Act of 1970, and any other direct

11
(1) IN GENERAL.—The Board, in consultation 
12
with the Commission of Social Impact Partnerships 
13
established under section 2057 of the Social Security 
14
Act, shall develop and make publicly available guid-
15
ance regarding best practices for the evaluation of 
16
eligible workforce development programs and eligible 
17
post-secondary education programs to be used to as-
18
sess the quality of each evaluation as required under 
19
subsection (b). Such guidance shall seek to ensure 
20
that— 
21
(A) the evaluation accurately models a par-
22
ticipant group population that is representative 
23
of the overall population served by the program;

•HR 4338 IH
(B) aggregate shifts that might affect 
1
baseline numbers are controlled for by the eval-
2
uation; and 
3
(C) regardless of any other factors, all pos-
4
sible safeguards are undertaken to avoid statis-
5
tical creaming, in which the impact of a pro-
6
gram is over measured as recruited participants 
7
become more highly skilled prior to participa-
8
tion over time. 
9
(2) PROCEDURE.—In issuing the guidance and 
10
performance benchmarks defined above, the Board 
11
shall release and circulate draft guidance, regula-
12
tions, and performance benchmarks, which shall be 
13
circulated to the Commission, and shall not be 
14
adopted unless approved by a majority vote of the 
15
Commission at a public meeting, and the Commis-
16
sion shall receive proposed draft guidance or per-
17
formance benchmarks not less than 30 days prior to 
18
voting to approve it. The Board shall use the draft 
19
guidance, regulations, and performance benchmarks, 
20
once approved by the Commission, to review grant 
21
applications under this Act and make recommenda-
22
tions to the Secretary with respect to the awarding 
23
of such grants, as described in subsection (b).
