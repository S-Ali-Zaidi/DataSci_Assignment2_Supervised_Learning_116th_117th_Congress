SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
1
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following find-
2
ings: 
3
(1) The information landscape in North Korea 
4
is the most repressive in the world, consistently 
5
ranking last or near-last in the annual World Press 
6
Freedom Index. 
7
(2) Under the brutal rule of Kim Jung Un, the 
8
country’s leader since 2012, the North Korean re-
9
gime has tightened controls on access to informa-
10
tion, as well as enacted harsh punishments for con-
11
sumers of outside media, including sentencing to 
12
time in a concentration camp and a maximum pen-
13
alty of death. 
14
(3) Such repressive and unjust laws sur-
15
rounding information in North Korea resulted in the 
16
death of 22-year-old United States citizen and uni-
17
versity student Otto Warmbier, who had traveled to 
18
North Korea in December 2015 as part of a guided 
19
tour. 
20
(4) Otto Warmbier was unjustly arrested, sen-
21
tenced to 15 years of hard labor, and severely mis-
22
treated at the hands of North Korean officials. 
23
While in captivity, Otto Warmbier suffered a serious 
24
medical emergency that placed him into a comatose 
25
07:28 Sep 13, 2022

•HR 8799 IH
state. Otto Warmbier was comatose upon his release 
1
in June 2017 and died 6 days later. 
2
(5) Despite increased penalties for possession 
3
and viewership of foreign media, the people of North 
4
Korea have increased their desire for foreign media 
5
content, according to a survey of 200 defectors con-
6
cluding that 90 percent had watched South Korean 
7
or other foreign media before defecting. 
8
(6) On March 23, 2021, in an annual resolu-
9
tion, the United Nations General Assembly con-
10
demned ‘‘the long-standing and ongoing systematic, 
11
widespread and gross violations of human rights in 
12
the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’’ and ex-
13
pressed grave concern at, among other things, ‘‘the 
14
denial of the right to freedom of thought, conscience, 
15
and religion . . . and of the rights to freedom of 
16
opinion, expression, and association, both online and 
17
offline, which is enforced through an absolute mo-
18
nopoly on information and total control over orga-
19
nized social life, and arbitrary and unlawful state 
20
surveillance that permeates the private lives of all 
21
citizens’’. 
22
(7) In 2018, Typhoon Yutu caused extensive 
23
damage to 15 broadcast antennas used by the 
24
United States Agency for Global Media in Asia, re-

sulting in reduced programming to North Korea. 
1
The United States Agency for Global Media has re-
2
built 5 of the 15 antenna systems as of June 2021. 
3
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
4
gress that— 
5
(1) in the event of a crisis situation, particu-
6
larly where information pertaining to the crisis is 
7
being actively censored or a false narrative is being 
8
put forward, the United States should be able to 
9
quickly increase its broadcasting capability to deliver 
10
fact-based information to audiences, including those 
11
in North Korea; and 
12
(2) the United States International Broad-
13
casting Surge Capacity Fund is already authorized 
14
under section 316 of the United States International 
15
Broadcasting Act of 1994 (22 U.S.C. 6216), and ex-
16
panded authority to transfer unobligated balances 
17
from expired accounts of the United States Agency 
18
for Global Media would enable the Agency to more 
19
nimbly respond to crises. 
20
SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
21
It is the policy of the United States— 
22
(1) to provide the people of North Korea with 
23
access to a diverse range of fact-based information; 
24
07:28 Sep 13, 2022

•HR 8799 IH
(2) to develop and implement novel means of 
1
communication and information sharing that in-
2
crease opportunities for audiences in North Korea to 
3
safely create, access, and share digital and non-dig-
4
ital news without fear of repressive censorship, sur-
5
veillance, or penalties under law; and 
6
(3) to foster and innovate new technologies to 
7
counter North Korea’s state-sponsored repressive 
8
surveillance and censorship by advancing internet 
9
freedom tools, technologies, and new approaches.
