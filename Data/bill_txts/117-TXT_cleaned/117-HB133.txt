SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds that— 
7
(1) the incidence of violence motivated by the 
8
actual or perceived race, color, national origin, reli-
9
gion, sexual orientation, gender, or disability of the 
10
victim poses a serious national problem;

•HR 133 IH
(2) such violence disrupts the tranquility and 
1
safety of communities and is deeply divisive; 
2
(3) existing Federal law is inadequate to ad-
3
dress this problem; 
4
(4) such violence affects interstate commerce in 
5
many ways, including— 
6
(A) by impeding the movement of members 
7
of targeted groups and forcing such members to 
8
move across State lines to escape the incidence 
9
or risk of such violence; and 
10
(B) by preventing members of targeted 
11
groups from purchasing goods and services, ob-
12
taining or sustaining employment or partici-
13
pating in other commercial activity; 
14
(5) perpetrators cross State lines to commit 
15
such violence; 
16
(6) instrumentalities of interstate commerce are 
17
used to facilitate the commission of such violence; 
18
(7) such violence is committed using articles 
19
that have traveled in interstate commerce; 
20
(8) violence motivated by bias that is a relic of 
21
slavery can constitute badges and incidents of slav-
22
ery; 
23
(9) although many local jurisdictions have at-
24
tempted to respond to the challenges posed by such

•HR 133 IH
violence, the problem is sufficiently serious, wide-
1
spread, and interstate in scope to warrant Federal 
2
intervention to assist such jurisdictions; and 
3
(10) many States have no laws addressing vio-
4
lence based on the actual or perceived race, color, 
5
national origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender, 
6
or disability of the victim, while other States have 
7
laws that provide only limited protection.
