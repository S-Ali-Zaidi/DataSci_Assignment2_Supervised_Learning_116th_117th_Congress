6
heat-health implications. 
7
(5) HEAT-HEALTH.—The term ‘‘heat-health’’

17
intensity of heat waves and increased ambient tem-
18
perature.

•HR 5296 IH
(8) URBAN HEAT ISLAND.—The term ‘‘urban 
1
heat island’’ means the phenomenon observed in ur-
2
banized areas in which heat is more extreme than in 
3
the surrounding exurban areas and heat is hetero-
4
geneously distributed within urbanized areas, due to 
5
factors including— 
6
(A) low albedo and impervious surfaces; 
7
(B) low vegetation coverage; and 
8
(C) waste heat produced in urban areas. 
9
SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
10
Congress makes the following findings: 
11
(1) Extreme heat events have been the leading 
12
cause of weather-related death in the United States 
13
over the last 30 years, according to the Centers for 
14
Disease Control and Prevention and the National 
15
Weather Service. 
16
(2) The fourth National Climate Assessment, 
17
mandated by the Global Change Research Act of 
18
1990 (15 U.S.C. 2921 et seq.), finds that during the 
19
next few decades, annual average temperature over 
20
the contiguous United States is projected to increase 
21
by a further 2.2° F relative to current temperatures, 
22
regardless of future scenarios. The National Climate 
23
Assessment projects that the frequency and intensity

•HR 5296 IH
of extreme heat events will increase in the future as 
1
global temperature increases. 
2
(3) Exposure to extreme heat can cause acute 
3
heat-related illnesses, such as heat stroke, which re-
4
sult in more than 65,000 emergency room visits 
5
each year and exacerbate respiratory and cardio-
6
vascular illnesses. 
7
(4) Heat poses the greatest health risks for 
8
adults older than 65 years of age, pregnant people, 
9
young children, low-income communities, urban com-
10
munities, communities with low air conditioning 
11
prevalence, socially isolated individuals, people with 
12
mental or physical disabilities, people with under-
13
lying medical conditions, agricultural or other out-
14
door workers, workers without sufficient access to 
15
cooling, athletes, incarcerated individuals, people ex-
16
periencing homelessness, and military personnel. 
17
(5) Increasingly common environmental expo-
18
sures exacerbated by climate change, such as ex-
19
treme heat, are significantly associated with serious 
20
adverse pregnancy outcomes across the United 
21
States. Those adverse pregnancy outcomes dispro-
22
portionately impact Black mothers. 
23
(6) Heat exposure is an issue of environmental 
24
justice, as people living in low-income communities, 
25

•HR 5296 IH
communities of color, and Tribal communities face a 
1
number of interacting factors that render them more 
2
vulnerable to extreme heat. 
3
(7) The impacts of heat on human health are 
4
more severe in urban areas where land surface prop-
5
erties create an urban heat island, particularly in 
6
neighborhoods with limited availability of or access 
7
to green spaces, shade, and tree cover, higher den-
8
sity of building structures, and more vehicular traf-
9
fic. 
10
(8) Limited availability of tree cover and higher 
11
temperatures are correlated with low-income neigh-
12
borhoods in urban areas. In Richmond, Virginia, 
13
Baltimore, Maryland, and Washington, DC, re-
14
searchers found that heat risk is disproportionately 
15
distributed to communities of color in patterns asso-
16
ciated with segregation and redlining. 
17
(9) Researchers have found that few commu-
18
nities in the United States have sufficient climate 
19
and health information, guidance, and resources for 
20
heat planning, preparedness, and response. 
21
(10) The risks associated with extreme heat 
22
have complex interactions and impacts, and the 
23
management of those risks requires a transdiscipli-
24
nary approach.

•HR 5296 IH
(11) Regions, communities, and populations 
1
that face the greatest health consequences of ex-
2
treme heat often may experience the lowest heat risk 
3
perceptions, have limited incentives, or have access 
4
to the fewest resources for responding to extreme 
5
heat, and as such, may be less likely to take pre-
6
cautions. 
7
(12) Research on the impacts of extreme heat 
8
on human health and the effectiveness of solutions 
9
under varying climate, social, and other contexts is 
10
stymied by a lack of access to reliable, timely health 
11
observations and surveillance due to proprietary data 
12
rights, expense, privacy and security concerns, incon-
13
sistent reporting of health outcomes and contribu-
14
tory factors, poor data integration and interoper-
15
ability, few incentives and little systematic coordina-
16
tion to address those problems, and a lack of ade-
17
quate climate observation, modeling, and assessment 
18
in urban, indoor, and occupational settings. 
19
(13) Integrated climate and health research and 
20
information, when developed in a collaborative, 
21
transdisciplinary manner, can inform long- and me-
22
dium-range scenario-based planning and decision 
23

24

treme heat, and address factors that increase vulner-
1
ability. 
2
(14) Heat action plans and early warning sys-
3
tems can reduce heat-related morbidity and mor-
4
tality by clearly identifying roles and responsibilities 
5
as well as evidence-based actions and thresholds to 
6
enhance preparedness, and by promoting behavior 
7
changes and actions taken by local governments, 
8
communities, and individuals through awareness and 
9
increased risk perception among those most vulner-
10
able to the health impacts of heat.
