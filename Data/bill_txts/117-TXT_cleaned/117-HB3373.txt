(c) OBJECTIVES.—In developing the strategy re-
8
quired by subsection (a), the Chief Executive Officer of 
9
the Corporation shall consider the following, to the max-
10
imum extent practicable: 
11
(1) How the full range of financing products 
12
and technical assistance tools available to the Cor-
13
poration can be used to help counter malign foreign 
14
influence in Oceania that entraps host countries with 
15
development projects that result in high indebted-
16
ness and financial imbalance. 
17
(2) How the Corporation can create an invest-
18
ment portfolio that complements existing United 
19
States foreign economic assistance programs in the 
20
countries of Oceania, including specifically those ac-
21
tivities aimed at advancing the long-term growth,

15
(5) How the capacity of the private sector and

economic constraints of the countries in Oceania 
17
may, at times, require that investment and develop-
18
ment are better supported by government rather 
19
than the private sector.

AND UNREGULATED FISHING IN OCEANIA. 
13
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
14
gress that— 
15
(1) many countries of the Oceania region de-
16
pend on commercial tuna fisheries as a critical com-
17
ponent of their economies; 
18
(2) the Government of the People’s Republic of 
19
China has used its licensed fishing fleet to exert 
20
greater influence in Oceania, but at the same time, 
21
its licensed fishing fleet is also a major contributor 
22
to illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing (in 
23
this section referred to as ‘‘IUU fishing’’) activities; 
24

•HR 3373 IH
(3) the sustainability of Oceania’s fisheries is 
1
threatened by IUU fishing, which depletes both com-
2
mercially important fish stocks and non-targeted 
3
species that help maintain the integrity of the ocean 
4
ecosystem; 
5
(4) IUU fishing puts pressure on protected spe-
6
cies of marine mammals, sea turtles, and sea birds, 
7
which also jeopardizes the integrity of the ocean eco-
8
system; 
9
(5) because IUU fishing goes unrecorded, the 
10
loss of biomass compromises the work of scientists 
11
to assess and model fishery stocks and advise man-
12
agers on sustainable catch levels; 
13
(6) beyond the damage to living marine re-
14
sources, IUU fishing also contributes directly to ille-
15
gal activity in the Oceania region, such as food 
16
fraud, smuggling, and human trafficking; 
17
(7) current approaches to IUU fishing enforce-
18
ment rely on established methods, such as vessel 
19
monitoring systems, logbooks maintained by govern-
20
ment fisheries enforcement authorities to record the 
21
catches landed by fishing vessels, and corroborating 
22
data on catches hand-collected by human observer 
23
programs; 
24
00:07 Jul 03, 2021
H3373
40 
•HR 3373 IH
(8) such established methods are imperfect be-
1
cause— 
2
(A) vessels can turn off monitoring sys-
3
tems and unlicensed vessels do not use them; 
4
and 
5
(B) observer coverage is thin and subject 
6
to human error and corruption; 
7
(9) maritime domain awareness technology so-
8
lutions for vessel monitoring have gained credibility 
9
in recent years and include systems such as observ-
10
ing instruments deployed on satellites, crewed and 
11
uncrewed air and surface systems, aircraft, and sur-
12
face vessels, as well as electronic monitoring systems 
13
on fishing vessels; 
14
(10) maritime domain awareness technologies 
15
hold the promise of significantly augmenting the 
16
current IUU fishing enforcement capacities; and 
17
(11) maritime domain awareness technologies 
18
offer an avenue for addressing key United States na-
19
tional interests, including those interests related 
20
to— 
21
(A) increasing bilateral diplomatic ties with 
22
key allies and partners in the Oceania region; 
23

(B) countering illicit trafficking in arms,

IUU fishing; 
3
(C) advancing security, long-term growth, 
4
and development in the Oceania region; 
5
(D) supporting ocean conservation objec-
