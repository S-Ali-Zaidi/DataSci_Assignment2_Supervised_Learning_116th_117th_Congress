and condemning violations of human rights and state- 
sponsored terrorism by the Iranian Government. 
Whereas beginning in 2017, and continuing for several 
months after protests erupted in more than 100 cities,

sive forces that resulted in at least 25 deaths and 4,000 
arrests, including decorated wrestling champion Navid 
Afkari, who was later executed in September 2020 
amidst international outrage; 
Whereas, on November 15, 2019, popular protests against

Council can monitor such violations;

stances, and deprivation of medical care’’; 
Whereas, from January 11 to 13, 2020, protesters gathered 
across Iran chanting against Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali 
Khamenei and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps 
after it shot down a Ukrainian passenger plane killing

and live ammunition against the protesters; 
Whereas the Iranian regime has routinely violated the human 
rights of Iranian citizens, including by implementing on-

sion of political demonstrations in 1999, 2009, and 2017, 
and pressure the Government of Iran to provide family 
members detailed information that they were denied 
about the final resting places of any missing victims of 
such abuses’’; 
Whereas the killings were carried out on the orders of a 
judge, an official from the Ministry of Intelligence, and 
a state prosecutor, known to the prisoners as ‘‘Death 
Commissions’’, which were formed on July 19, 1988, and 
undertook proceedings in a manner designed to eliminate 
the regime’s opponents; 
Whereas Amnesty International described as a ‘‘momentous 
breakthrough’’ marking a ‘‘turning point’’ the September 
3, 2020, communication by seven United Nations human 
rights experts, regarding information that ‘‘between July 
and September 1988, the Iranian authorities forcibly dis-
appeared and extrajudicially executed thousands of im-
prisoned political dissidents affiliated with political oppo-
sition groups in 32 cities in secret and discarded their 
bodies, mostly in unmarked mass graves’’, as United Na-
tions experts warned that ‘‘the situation may amount to 
crimes against humanity’’;

munity to take action to investigate the cases through the 
establishment of an international investigation;

Whereas senior Iranian Government, military, judicial, and

egregious human rights violations and acts of terror; 
Whereas the Iranian people have been deprived of their fun-
damental freedoms for which reason they rejected 
monarchic dictatorship and are opposing religious tyr-
anny; 
Whereas, on June 30, 2018, tens of thousands of people 
gathered in Paris at the Free Iran gathering where they 
supported advocates for a democratic, secular, and non- 
nuclear Republic of Iran, and showed support for the op-
position leader Mrs. Maryam Rajavi’s 10-point plan for

Iran’s diplomat Assadollah Assadi to the maximum sen-
tence of 20 years imprisonment for his role in planning

his 3 accomplices were given jail terms of 15 to 18 years 
and stripped of their Belgian citizenship; 
Whereas Assadi took an Iranian-made bomb from Iran to 
Europe on a commercial flight, and delivered it to his ac-
complices with the aim of causing mass casualties at the 
Free Iran gathering in Paris in 2018; 
Whereas the Belgium court found ‘‘that the four defendants 
are part of a larger terrorist group within a specific Ira-
nian intelligence service. This appears from the sums of 
money paid to the defendants, the way information was 
gathered, the meetings in Iran, the use of diplomatic sta-
tus, and the making and testing of the explosive device 
in Iran itself.’’; 
Whereas, on July 10, 2018, a senior Department of State of-
ficial said, ‘‘Iran uses embassies as cover to plot terrorist 
attacks’’, and that ‘‘The most recent example is the plot

out of the Austrian Embassy as part of the plot to bomb 
a meeting of Iranian opposition leaders in Paris.’’;

Iran (PMOI/MEK); 
Whereas, in January 2020, the Government of Albania ex-
pelled two other Iranian diplomats also for planning ter-
rorist activities against the MEK; 
Whereas the expulsion of the Iranian Ambassador by the 
Government of Albania is a positive and important step, 
which sends the right message that no Iranian embassies 
should be used for plotting terror and conducting spying 
activities against dissidents; 
Whereas Iran’s malign activities in the Balkans, specifically 
its presence and activities in Albania, pose a serious 
threat to United States national security interests; 
Whereas the Department of State has urged ‘‘all nations to
