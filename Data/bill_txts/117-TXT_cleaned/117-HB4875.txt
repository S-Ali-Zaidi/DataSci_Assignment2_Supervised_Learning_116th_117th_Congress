SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. 
1
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Many consumers pay as much for DSL as 
3
they do for fiber, despite fiber offering significantly 
4
faster speeds and greater reliability. 
5
(2) Internet service providers are less likely to 
6
upgrade to fiber as a transmission medium in low- 
7
income communities. Households where fiber net-
8
works are deployed have a median income 34 per-
9
cent higher than those with only DSL. 
10
(3) Communities of color are more likely to 
11
have slower and less reliable internet service. This 
12
disparity creates significant barriers to accessing 
13
employment opportunities, educational opportunities, 
14
healthcare resources, and diminishes opportunities 
15
for civic engagement. 
16
(4) The creation of significant disparities in 
17
internet service within a geographic area imposes 
18
significant costs not only on the individuals with 
19
slower or less reliable service, but on government at 
20

the local, State and Federal level by requiring gov-
1
ernments to provide non-digital as well as digital 
2
means of accessing benefits, paying bills, sharing in-
3
formation, and otherwise choosing between either of-
4
fering redundant non-digital means of interaction or 
5
excluding residents without access to high speed, re-
6
liable broadband. 
7
(5) Communities with poor quality broadband 
8
have difficulty attracting businesses, attracting new 
9
residents, and have difficulty competing with com-
10
munities with superior broadband options available. 
11
(6) Companies can deploy fiber to most lower 
12
income communities and generate sufficient revenue 
13
to recoup the cost of deployment. 
14
(7) Broadband is an essential service and con-
15
sumers, regardless of income, race, ethnicity, color 
16
or 
national 
origin 
deserve 
affordable 
reliable 
17
broadband. 
18
(8) Competition between internet service pro-
19
viders within a specific neighborhood is an important 
20
means of ensuring quality service and lower prices to 
21
the residents of that neighborhood. By contrast, 
22
neighborhoods with a single provider often suffer 
23
from lower quality service and higher prices.

•HR 4875 IH
(9) Internet service providers, State and local 
1
governments, and the Federal Communications 
2
Commission have all identified arrangements by 
3
ISPs between landlords, housing associations, and 
4
other relevant private entities designed (collectively 
5
‘‘landlords’’) to thwart access by competitors as a 
6
significant contributing factor to digital redlining by 
7
preventing or discouraging access to superior service 
8
and eliminating the threat of competition to the pre-
9
ferred provider. These arrangements may take the 
10
form of exclusive access for a single provider, dis-
11
counts to residents on rent, utility payments, or 
12
other landlord generated charges, additional ex-
13
penses to either the resident or the competing pro-
14
vider to access and install necessary equipment or 
15
inside wiring. Landlords may also impose restric-
16
tions on access by rival providers for purposes of 
17
marketing rival services, or otherwise limit commu-
18
nication between rival providers and residents. 
19
(10) Although the Federal Communications 
20
Commission formally prohibited express exclusive 
21
agreements between landlords and broadband pro-
22
viders in 2007, these arrangements continue to per-
23
sist as a consequence of loopholes and the lack of an 
24

•HR 4875 IH
effective enforcement mechanism to ensure swift ac-
1
cess of willing competitors to willing customers. 
2
(11) Even where local and State authorities 
3
have reached agreements with competing internet 
4
service providers to deploy in neighborhoods suf-
5
fering redlining, the presence of these agreements 
6
has thwarted competitive entry and aggravated dig-
7
ital redlining. 
8
(12) As a consequence of agreements between 
9
landlords and internet service providers, Americans 
10
can lose the benefits of competition, leading to high-
11
er prices and poorer service. 
12
(13) Traditionally, wireless technologies have 
13
been less subject to digital redlining because a single 
14
tower can cover an area of many miles. Newer wire-
15
less technologies, such as 5G, employ towers with 
16
much smaller coverage areas—sometimes requiring 
17
multiple towers to provide adequate coverage within 
18
a neighborhood. This has generated concern that, 
19
without Congressional action, communities that now 
20
suffer digital redlining from wireline services may 
21
suffer similar wireless digital redlining in the future.

services are a well-established regulatory tool, and 
1
do not constitute an unconstitutional taking. 
2
(b) PURPOSE.—It is the purpose of this Act— 
3
(1) to identify and remedy ‘‘digital redlining’’, 
4
regardless of the level of competition in the market 
5
as a whole, by ensuring all Americans, especially 
6
those in traditionally underserved or marginalized 
7
communities, have access to competing broadband 
8
networks at the same quality of service, at reason-
9
able prices, as available in other similarly situated 
10
communities with higher median incomes or dif-
11
ferent demographic makeup; 
12
(2) to empower and require the Federal Com-
13
munications Commission to identify what constitutes 
14
digital redlining, and to empower and require the 
15
Commission to enact regulations designed to elimi-
16
nate digital redlining; and 
17
(3) to enable competing broadband providers 
18
frustrated by exclusive arrangements between rival 
19
providers and landlords to serve willing customers.

SEC. 4. RULES REQUIRED TO PREVENT DIGITAL RED-
3
LINING. 
4
(a) RULES REQUIRED.—Not later than 2 years after 
5
the date of the enactment of this Act and based on the 
6
findings from the notice of inquiry under section 3, the 
7
Commission shall promulgate rules that do the following: 
8
(1) Overcome identified barriers from such no-
9
tice of inquiry, including rules to prevent discrimina-
10
tion of access based on income level, race, color, reli-
11
gion, or national origin. 
12
(2) Define the granularity of the geographic 
13
area in which the Commission considers compliance 
14
with the rules adopted, taking into account whether 
15
information at a census-block level or a more dis-
16
crete level is needed to identify areas where redlining 
17
is occurring. 
18
(3) Determine what factors would permit an 
19
ISP to not deploy to the entirety of a clearly defined 
20
geographic area with comparable robust broadband 
21
service, taking into account that deployment plan-
22
ning for areas may proceed in differing stages. In 
23
developing this determination, the Commission shall 
24
establish a process by which a provider may request 
25

•HR 4875 IH
an exemption from a requirement to deploy robust 
1
broadband to the entirety of a clearly defined geo-
2
graphic area upon a showing that factors other than 
3
income level, race, color, religion, or national origin 
4
are the causes of the inability to deploy broadband. 
5
(b) COMMISSION POLICIES.—The Commission shall 
6
ensure that the policies of the Commission promote equal 
7
access to robust broadband by prohibiting deployment dis-
8
