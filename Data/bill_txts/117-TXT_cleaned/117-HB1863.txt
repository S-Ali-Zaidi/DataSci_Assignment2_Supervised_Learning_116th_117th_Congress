A BILL 
To establish a grant program to fund the installation of 
green roof systems on public school buildings, and for 
other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Public School Green 
4
Rooftop Program’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Green roofs on educational facilities can 
8
provide an easily accessible site to teach students

and visitors about biology, math, STEM, art, sus-
1
tainability, green roof technology, and the benefits of 
2
green roofs. 
3
(2) The Environmental Protection Agency rec-
4
ognizes the installation of green roofs throughout a 
5
city can help reduce surface urban heat islands and 
6
cool the air. 
7
(3) The General Services Administration recog-
8
nizes a typical green roof lasts more than 40 years 
9
before requiring replacement, whereas the life of an 
10
unvegetated conventional roof could be 10 to 15 
11
years. By making the roof membranes last longer, 
12
green roofs can save taxpayer money and reduce the 
13
amount of waste that is diverted into landfills. 
14
(4) The National Park Service recognizes green 
15
roofs can improve the energy performance of build-
16
ings, help manage stormwater, reduce airborne emis-
17
sions, and mitigate the effects of urban heat islands. 
18
(5) The Food and Agriculture Organization of 
19
the United Nations encourages and supports coun-
20
tries to promote school gardens with educational 
21
goals to help students, school staff, and families 
22
make the connection between growing food and good 
23
diets, develop life skills, and increase environmental 
24
awareness.

•HR 1863 IH
(6) Greater weatherization and insulation of-
1
fered by green roof assemblies reduce the amount of 
2
energy needed to moderate the temperature of a 
3
building, as roofs can be the source of the greatest 
4
heat loss in the winter and the hottest temperatures 
5
in the summer. 
6
(7) A green roof can protect waterproofing 
7
membranes from exposure to ultraviolet radiation 
8
and wide temperature fluctuations. This protection 
9
feature can greatly extend the lifespan and cost ef-
10
fectiveness of waterproofing membranes. 
11
(8) Green roofs can contribute to landfill diver-
12
sion by prolonging the life cycle of waterproofing 
13
membranes and insulation materials. By increasing 
14
the life cycle and reducing roof replacement costs, 
15
less roofing materials over the life of the building 
16
need to be disposed of. Green roofs generate the 
17
need for recycled components in growing media. 
18
Green roofs can prolong the service life of heating, 
19
ventilation, and HVAC systems through decreased 
20
use. 
21
(9) Green roofs can reduce the amount of 
22
stormwater runoff and also delay the time at which 
23
runoff occurs, resulting in decreased stress on sewer 
24

systems and streams at peak flow periods and de-
1
creased pollution in United States waterways. 
2
(10) The plants on green roofs can capture air-
3
borne pollutants, atmospheric deposition, and can 
4
filter noxious gases, as well as provide habitat for 
5
and habitat connectivity for local species of polli-
6
nators. 
7
(11) Green roofs can provide much needed ad-
8
ditional greenspaces to urban centers. These 
9
greenspaces can create new habitats for a wide vari-
10
ety of plants, animals, and insects needed for 
11
healthy biosystems. 
12
(12) Green roofs can provide much needed 
13
greenspaces for healthy human habitation of dense 
14
urban spaces. Green roofs can be used for passive 
15
and active recreation and relaxation spaces for hu-
16
mans. 
17
(13) Green roofs can generate potential employ-
18
ment for green roof installation and maintenance 
19
personnel. Specialized green roof installations can 
20
generate income and employment for urban farm op-
21
erations. 
22
(14) The temperature moderating effects of 
23
green roofs can reduce demand for electrical power 
24
and other energy and fuel sources, and potentially 
25

•HR 1863 IH
decrease the amount of CO2 and other polluting by- 
1
products being released into the air. 
2
(15) Through natural transpiration, plants on 
3
vertical and horizontal surfaces are able to cool cities 
4
during hot summer months and reduce the urban 
5
heat island effect. 
6
(16) Green roofs plants can capture dust and 
7
particulate matter throughout cities, as well as the 
8
production of smog. This can play a role in reducing 
9
greenhouse gas emissions and adapting urban areas 
10
to a future climate with warmer summers. 
11
(17) Green roofs improve human health and 
12
wellbeing through improvement of local air quality, 
13
regulation of temperature, and sequestration of 
14
harmful airborne substances, particularly among 
15
children and other vulnerable or at-risk commu-
16
nities. 
17
(18) Green roofs on public infrastructure pro-
18
vide cost-savings for the life of the project, through 
19
defraying future replacement and energy costs. 
20
(19) Green roofs contribute to the stabilization 
21
of neighborhoods as a result of improved health, sce-
22
nic qualities, and elevated nearby property valuation. 
23
(20) Green roofs provide habitat for wildlife 
24
such as pollinators and migratory birds.
