SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
5
Congress find the following: 
6
(1) An estimated 4,600,000 minors in the 
7

8

(2) Seventy-three percent of children under the 
1
age of 10 living in homes with firearms reported 
2
knowing the location of their parents’ firearms. 
3
Thirty-six percent of those children reported han-
4
dling their parents’ unsecured firearms. 
5
(3) The presence of unsecured firearms in the 
6
home increases the risk of unintentional and inten-
7
tional shootings. Over 75 percent of firearms used in 
8
youth suicide attempts and unintentional firearm in-
9
juries were stored in the residence of the victim, a 
10
relative, or a friend. 
11
(4) The United States Secret Service and the 
12
Department of Education report that in 65 percent 
13
of deadly school shootings the attacker obtained the 
14
firearm from his or her own home or that of a rel-
15
ative. 
16
(5) In the last decade, nearly 2,000,000 fire-
17
arms have been reported stolen. In 2016 alone, 
18
238,000 firearms were reported stolen in the United 
19
States. Between 2010 and 2016, police recovered 
20
more than 23,000 stolen firearms across jurisdic-
21
tions that were used to commit kidnappings, armed 
22
robberies, sexual assaults, murders, and other vio-
23
lent crimes.

(6) Higher levels of neighborhood gun violence 
1
drive depopulation, discourages commercial activity, 
2
and decreases property values, resulting in fewer 
3
business establishments, fewer jobs, lower home val-
4
ues, and lower home ownership rates. 
5
(7) The negative economic impact of gun vio-
6
lence in communities is tied directly to the national 
7
economy and interstate commerce. 
8
(8) Congress has the power under the interstate 
9
commerce clause and other provisions of the Con-
10
stitution of the United States to enact measures en-
11
suring firearms are securely stored.
