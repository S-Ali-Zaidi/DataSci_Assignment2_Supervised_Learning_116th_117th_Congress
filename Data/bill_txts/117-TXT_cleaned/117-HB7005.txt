•HR 7005 IH
(1) High inflation erodes the earnings and sav-
1
ings of hard-working individuals across the United 
2
States. 
3
(2) The Consumer Price Index rose 7.5 percent 
4
from January 2021 to January 2022, which is the 
5
largest increase in a 12-month period in over 30 
6
years. 
7
(3) The current environment, where high infla-
8
tion is paired with low interest rates, pushes real 
9
savings yields deep into negative territory. 
10
(4) While the yield of a 1-year Treasury bill in 
11
January 2022 was 0.5 percent, the real yield of the 
12
bill was negative 7 percent. 
13
(5) Negative savings returns adversely affect all 
14
who save, especially retirees and those who rely on 
15
savings to build wealth or to prepare for large ex-
16
penses, such as college tuition or a down payment on 
17
a home.
