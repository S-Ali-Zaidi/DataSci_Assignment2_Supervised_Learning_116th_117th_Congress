eran’s eligibility for care and services furnished by

the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
7
(4) The use or possession of cannabis is prohib-
8
ited on all Department property and in all Depart-
9
ment facilities pursuant to Federal law, which ap-
10
plies at such locations and not the laws of the State 
11
where the property or facility is located. 
12

13
the desires of their patients to seek alternative forms 
14
of treatment.

19
addiction treatment solely by reason of medicinal 
20
cannabis use.

22
to discuss cannabis use as part of comprehensive 
23

and a veteran should have the freedom to seek a sec-
1
ond opinion if the veteran feels the change is not 
2
fair.

(8) Department medical providers will annotate 
4
a veteran’s cannabis use in the medical record of the

8
protected under patient privacy and confidentiality 
9
laws and regulations. Department medical providers 
10
will not record that a patient has a marijuana addic-
11
tion problem in their medical record if the patient is

responsibly using medicinal cannabis.

(9) Department clinicians shall follow Federal 
14
laws and regulations relating to medicinal cannabis. 
15
(10) Department medical providers may not be

fired nor have any other adverse personnel action 
17
taken against them for discussing cannabis use with 
18
their patients.

20
search on cannabis benefits and risks under regu-
21
latory approval. 
22
(12) Department medical providers may not 
23
dissuade participation in non-Department medicinal
