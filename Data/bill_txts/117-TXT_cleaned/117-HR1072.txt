Whereas there is no cure for hepatitis B and individuals with 
chronic hepatitis B require lifelong medical care; 
Whereas chronic hepatitis B represents one of the most com-
mon causes of liver cancer; 
Whereas 1 in every 4 individuals with unmanaged chronic

with hepatitis B risk factors, are recommended to be vac-
cinated against hepatitis B;

Whereas the number of reported acute hepatitis B cases in-
creased by 11 percent nationwide between 2014 and 
2018; 
Whereas as a result of the opioid epidemic, there have been 
significant regional increases in acute hepatitis B cases 
in the United States, including—

ple who inject drugs; 
Whereas according to the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, hepatitis B is 50 to 100 times more infec-
tious than HIV and 5 to 10 times more infectious than 
hepatitis C; and 
Whereas there are significant opportunities, particularly with-
in the setting of the opioid epidemic, to prevent new hep-
atitis B infections and thereby reduce the incidence of 
liver cancer and cirrhosis through efforts to— 
(1) increase adult hepatitis B vaccination; and 
(2) maintain childhood hepatitis B vaccination: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
