Act, the Administrator shall develop procedures to 
1
appropriately and respectfully screen self-identified 
2
transgender passengers. In developing such proce-
3
dures, the Administrator shall take into consider-
4
ation the particular needs of persons whose gender 
5
identity is different or is perceived to be different 
6
from their assigned sex at birth and the particular 
7
impact of screening on transgender passengers as 
8
opposed to the general population of passengers.

(2) PASSENGERS WITH RELIGIOUS HEADWEAR 
10
AND OTHER ARTICLES OF FAITH.—Not later than 
11
60 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, 
12
the Administrator shall develop procedures to appro-
13
priately and respectfully screen individuals traveling 
14
with religious headwear or other articles of faith. In 
15
developing such procedures, the Administrator shall 
16
take into consideration the particular needs of per-
17
sons whose religious faith requires traveling with ar-
18
ticles of faith and the particular impact of screening 
19
on these passengers as opposed to the general popu-
20
lation of passengers.

(b) TRAINING OF TSOS AND IMPLEMENTATION OF 
22
PROCEDURES.—Not later than 90 days after the date of

The Administrator shall take such steps as may be 
7
necessary to ensure each of the following with respect to 
8
passenger screening: 
9
(1) The prohibition on human viewing of indi-
10
vidual passenger images. 
11
(2) The prohibition on retention of individual 
12
passenger image data. 
13
(3) That passengers are provided with an alter-
14
native to advanced imaging technology scans. 
15
(4) That pat-downs of passengers are required 
16
to be conducted by an officer of the gender re-
17
quested by the passenger. 
18
(5) That each passenger is provided with the 
19
option of a private screening in an area with a mir-
20
ror and with the witness of the passenger’s choice. 
21
(6) That passengers are not required to lift or 
22
remove clothing exposing sensitive areas of the body

is available and the passenger is provided with visual 
1
privacy via a drape or other means in a private 
2
screening area. 
3
(7) That pat-downs or other secondary screen-
4
ing measures shall be no more intrusive than nec-
5
essary to resolve an alarm or other concern raised 
6
by primary screening (including consideration of less 
7
intrusive alternatives such as a self pat-down with 
8
explosive trace detection, a limited pat-down, or ca-
9
nine detection and consideration of the sensitivity of 
10
the groin, chest, and other body areas and the sensi-
11
tivity of religious articles of faith, including religious 
12
headwear). 
13
(8) The prohibition of profiling or other dis-
14
crimination on the basis of race, color, national ori-
15
gin, religion, age, disability, genetic information, pa-
16
rental status, or sex (including on the basis of sexual

(a) STUDY.—Not later than 180 days after the date

of the enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall con-
21
duct a study on the cost and feasibility of retrofitting ad-
22
vanced image technology screening equipment, or of devel-
23
oping new such equipment, with the capability to distin-

10
(a) STUDY.—Not later than 180 days after the date 
11
of the enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall con-
12
duct a study that evaluates the particular impact that ad-

14
nonconforming passengers, passengers whose religious 
15
faith requires them to travel with articles of faith includ-
16
ing religious headwear, and passengers traveling with as-
17
sistive devices, as opposed to the general population of 
18
passengers. Such study shall include an examination of in-
19
stances since 2010 in which a self-identified transgender 
20
or gender nonconforming passenger or a passenger with 
21
religious headwear was required to undergo an additional 
22
screening procedure after screening with advanced imag-
23
ing technology resulted in an alarm.
