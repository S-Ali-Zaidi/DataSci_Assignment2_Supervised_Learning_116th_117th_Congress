States, do not have access to benefits and protec-
1
tions typically provided through traditional full-time 
2
employment.

(2) These independent workers are independent 
4
contractors, temporary workers, or self-employed, or 
5
work pursuant to other contingent or alternative 
6
work arrangements. 
7
(3) According to a 2015 study by the Comp-
8
troller General of the United States, the size of the 
9
contingent workforce grew from 35 percent of em-
10
ployed workers in 2006 to 40 percent of employed 
11
workers in 2010. 
12
(4) According to a 2016 study by economists 
13
Lawrence Katz and Alan Krueger, 94 percent of net 
14
employment growth in the United States economy 
15
from 2005 to 2015 occurred in alternative work ar-
16
rangements. 
17
(5) As the population of independent workers
