•HR 1970 IH
(1) Foreign governments and foreign political 
1
parties attempt to influence the government and po-
2
litical system of the United States through donations 
3
to nonprofit charitable organizations especially think 
4
tanks and cultural organizations. 
5
(2) While institutions of higher learning are re-
6
quired to disclose foreign gifts to the Department of 
7
Education pursuant to the Higher Education Act, 
8
no such requirement exists for think tanks.

(3) A number of think tanks and cultural orga-
10
nizations incorporated in the United States have re-
11
ceived money from the United Front Work Depart-
12
ment of the Chinese Communist Party—an organi-
13
zation based on conducting political warfare against 
14
enemies of the Chinese Communist Party and under-
15
mining democracy around the world.

(4) The Department of Defense found in its

Military and Strategic Developments Involving the

People’s Republic of China 2019 Report that: 
19
‘‘China conducts influence operations against cul-
20
tural institutions, media organizations, and the busi-
21

tanks, and state-run media to advance its soft power

campaign in support of China’s security interests.’’.

(5) A report by the U.S. China Security and 
4
Economic Commission noted that a number of 
5
Washington DC think tanks and universities have 
6
received funding from Tung Cheehwa, a vice chair-
7
man of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative 
8
Conference, which is a group that directs the United

Front Work Department.

(6) The Center for a New American Security 
11
noted in its 2019 report ‘‘Rising to the China Chal-
12
lenge’’ that: ‘‘A number of U.S. universities, aca-
13
demic departments, individual scholars, think tanks, 
14
and other civil society organizations receive substan-
15
tial funding from Beijing that is often targeted at 
16
shaping views and discourse on China. Higher de-
17
grees of transparency can help to ensure that this 
18
funding is not generating hidden forms of foreign 
19
lobbying, self censorship, or other activities that un-
20
dermine core U.S. democratic principles.’’.

(7) Bill Gertz of the Washington Free Beacon 
22
reported on August 28, 2018, that: ‘‘In addition to

Johns Hopkins, other think tanks linked to China
