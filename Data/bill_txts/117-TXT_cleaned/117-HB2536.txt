Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

Immigrant Violence Act of 2021’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 2536 IH
(1) Anti-immigrant violence is on the rise, with 
1
the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) reporting 
2
an 0.95-percent increase in hate crimes against indi-
3
viduals for 2019 compared to 2018 and an observed 
4
shift in crimes against individuals as opposed to 
5
property. The FBI data shows that 57.6 percent of 
6
hate crimes reported were motivated by race, eth-
7
nicity, or ancestry. In addition, the 51 hate crime 
8
murders recorded in 2019 are the highest ever re-
9
ported by the FBI since it began tracking hate 
10
crimes in 1991. Since 2014, FBI hate crime statis-
11
tics have shown an increasing trend in hate crimes, 
12
with the highest yearly gains so far reported for 
13
2017 at 17 percent. 
14
(2) The vast majority of the reported hate 
15
crimes are related to race, ethnicity, or ancestry. Ac-
16
cording to the Department of Justice’s Bureau of 
17
Justice Statistics (BJS), Hispanics experience close 
18
to double the rate of hate crime victimization that 
19
non-Hispanic Whites (1.3 vs 0.7 per 1,000). The 
20
2019 National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) 
21
data shows that non-U.S. citizens are victimized at 
22
a rate of approximately 12.5 victims per 1,000 non- 
23
U.S. citizens.

•HR 2536 IH
(3) BJS has shown a precipitous decline in re-
1
porting of hate crimes since 2014, with BJS’s 
2
NCVS data showing that between 2013 and 2017 
3
more than half of all hate crimes (>100,000) went 
4
unreported annually. NCVS 2019 statistics show 
5
that after declining by more than 60 percent in the 
6
past 21 years, the number of violent crime victims 
7
has steadily increased since 2015; and that the rate 
8
of unreported violent crimes continues to rise; in-
9
creasing from 9.5 to 12.9 per 1,000 persons between 
10
2015 and 2018. 
11
(4) Many immigrant advocates cite fear of de-
12
portation as one of the reasons people are not com-
13
ing forward to report crimes. The threat of being re-
14
ported to Immigration and Customs Enforcement 
15
(ICE) is used by perpetrators of hate crimes to si-
16
lence both victims and witnesses and to avoid crimi-
17
nal prosecution. 
18
(5) Detention and removal of victims of hate 
19
crimes undermine the rule of law and gives perpetra-
20
tors the means by which to escape prosecution. The 
21
deportation of victims and witnesses denies them the 
22
ability to see justice served, prevents law enforce-
23
ment from keeping communities safe, and exacer-

bates the problems communities face in the rise of 
1
anti-immigrant violence. 
2
(6) Lack of resources has prevented law en-
3
forcement, prosecutors, and victimized communities 
4
from learning about available tools for their protec-
5
tion and the prosecution of these crimes. Everyone 
6
seeking justice for victims and eager to see a reduc-
7
tion in hate crimes must be afforded the resources 
8
to learn and educate the public of these available 
9
tools.

11
U VISA MAY BE ISSUED; ADDITIONAL U VISAS

MADE AVAILABLE.

(a) EXPANSION
OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITY.—Section 
14
101(a)(15)(U)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act 
15
(8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(U)) is amended by inserting after 
16
‘‘fraud in foreign labor contracting (as defined in section 
17
1351 of title 18, United States Code);’’ the following: 
18
‘‘hate crime acts;’’. 
19
(b) ADDITIONAL VISAS MADE AVAILABLE.—Section 
20
214(p)(2)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 
21
U.S.C. 1184(p)(2)(A)) is amended by striking ‘‘10,000’’ 
22
and inserting ‘‘12,000’’, thus designating the additional 
23
2,000 visas for victims of hate crimes.

1
PENDING PETITIONS AND APPLICATIONS.

(a) IN GENERAL.—A non-citizen described in sub-
3
section (b) shall not be removed from the United States 
4
under section 240 of the Immigration and Nationality Act 
5
(8 U.S.C. 1229a) or any other provision of law until there

(b) NON-CITIZENS DESCRIBED.—A non-citizen is de-
9
scribed in this subsection if the non-citizen—

11

240A(b)(2), or 244(a)(3) (as in effect on March 31, 
13
1997) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 
14
U.S.C. 1101, 1229a, 1254a); or 
15

16

Act, with a pending application for relief.

WITH PENDING PETITIONS AND APPLICA-
20
TIONS.

Section 236 of the Immigration and Nationality Act 
22
(8 U.S.C. 1226) is amended by adding at the end the fol-
23

‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—Notwithstanding any other 
1
provision of this Act, there shall be a presumption 
2
that the non-citizen described in paragraph (2) 
3
should be released from detention. The Secretary of 
4
Homeland Security shall have the duty of rebutting 
5
this presumption, which may only be shown based on 
6
clear and convincing evidence, including credible and 
7
individualized information, that the use of alter-
8
natives to detention will not reasonably ensure the 
9
appearance of the non-citizen at removal pro-
10
ceedings, or that the non-citizen is a threat to an-
11
other person or the community. The fact that a non- 
12
citizen has a criminal charge pending against the 
13
non-citizen may not be the sole factor to justify the 
14
continued detention of the non-citizen.

is described in this paragraph if the non-citizen—
