RESOLUTION 
Raising awareness for the cancer chordoma. 
Whereas chordoma is a slow growing, yet aggressive bone 
cancer of the skull and spine; 
Whereas it strikes people of all ages and affects more than 
25,000 individuals worldwide; 
Whereas each year, thousands of people are diagnosed with 
chordoma including about 300 people annually in the 
United States; 
Whereas chordomas are among the most complicated tumors 
to treat due to involvement of critical structures such as 
the brain stem, spinal cord, and important nerves and ar-
teries;
