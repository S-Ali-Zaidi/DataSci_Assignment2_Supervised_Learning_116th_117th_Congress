mination pilot program (referred to in this section as 
1
‘‘PAID pilot program’’). 
2
(2) The Secretary of Labor, acting through the 
3
Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division, es-
4
tablished the PAID pilot program to complement en-
5
forcement and compliance assistance tools under-
6
taken by the Wage and Hour Division of the De-
7
partment of Labor. 
8
(3) The Secretary has a longstanding practice 
9
of providing self-audit and office audit programs, as 
10
noted by Secretary Marty Walsh in a response for 
11
the record following a hearing before the Committee 
12
on Education and Labor of the House of Represent-
13
atives on June 9, 2021. 
14
(4) The Wage and Hour Division, through the 
15
PAID pilot program, worked with employers on a 
16
voluntary basis to remedy unintentional violations of 
17
the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 
18
201 et seq.), which is the Federal statute estab-
19
lishing minimum wage, overtime pay, recordkeeping, 
20
and youth-employment requirements affecting em-
21
ployees in the private sector and in Federal, State, 
22
and local governments. 
23
(5) The PAID pilot program yielded positive re-
24
sults for employers and employees. Between April 1, 
25

•HR 5743 IH
2018, and September 15, 2019, the Wage and Hour 
1
Division concluded 74 PAID pilot program cases, 
2
representing less than one percent of all compliance 
3
actions under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 
4
1938, with a total of $4,131,238 in back wages paid 
5
to 7,429 employees through such PAID pilot pro-
6
gram cases. 
7
(6) Self-audits through the PAID pilot program 
8
by employers returned more back wages to employ-
9
ees in less time than compliance actions overall. In 
10
fact, during the period described in paragraph (5)— 
11
(A) the average back wages paid per case 
12
for PAID pilot program cases ($55,828) were 
13
more than 4 times the average back wages paid 
14
per compliance action ($11,355); 
15
(B) the average back wages paid per en-
16
forcement hour for PAID pilot program cases 
17
($2,864) was more than 10 times greater than 
18
the average back wages paid per enforcement 
19
hour for compliance actions ($279); 
20
(C) on average, nearly 10 times more em-
21
ployees received back wages in each PAID pilot 
22
program case than in investigations conducted 
23
using traditional methods; 
24
22:40 Nov 02, 2021

•HR 5743 IH
(D) self-audits through the PAID pilot 
1
program averaged 19 hours per case as com-
2
pared to 41 hours per case for the Secretary 
3
conducted using traditional methods; and 
4
(E) self-audits through the PAID pilot 
5
program reached employers that the Wage and 
6
Hour Division would not typically prioritize for 
7
enforcement, including government establish-
8
ments and industry sectors with higher wage 
9
occupations.
