SEC. 101. FINDINGS. 
5
Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) United States colleges and universities are 
7
required publicly to report foreign gifts and con-
8
tracts to the Department of Education. Codified at 
9
section 117 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 
10
(20 U.S.C. 1011f), this mandate requires nearly all 
11
colleges and universities to report, twice each year, 
12
foreign gifts and contracts the value of which is 
13
$250,000 or more (considered alone or in combina-
14
tion with other gifts or contracts with a foreign 
15
source) and to disclose any foreign ownership or 
16
control to the Secretary of Education. 
17
(2) Congress applauds the Department of Edu-
18
cation for taking concrete steps to enforce section 
19
117, including the opening of 12 compliance inves-
20
tigations yielding important and actionable informa-
21
tion and catalyzed disclosure of $6,500,000,000 in 
22
previously unreported foreign money.

(3) On average, fewer than 300 of the approxi-
1
mately 6,000 United States colleges and universities 
2
report receiving foreign money each year. 
3
(4) It is in the interest of scientific and aca-
4
demic integrity that foreign funding is disclosed by 
5
the recipient. 
6
(5) Institutions have an obligation to comply 
7
with all applicable laws and regulations requiring 
8
disclosure of foreign funding.
