Museum is the steward of—

(9) Since the grand opening of the Strategic 
17
Air Command and Aerospace Museum, the museum 
18
has attracted nearly 3,000,000 visitors from around 
19
the world, of which the largest percentage are 
20
United States citizens from across the Nation. 
21
(10) There is an urgent need to preserve the 
22
stories, artifacts, and heroic achievements of the 
23
post-World War II era that saw the emergence of 
24
the United States as the sole superpower before the

1
Nuclear Deterrence and Containment of Com-
2
munism, eventually ending in the collapse of the So-
3

4
(11) The United States has a need to forever 
5
preserve the knowledge and history of its most im-
6
portant post-World War II responsibility of the 20th 
7
century, and to teach that history to citizens, visi-
8
tors, and school children for centuries to come. 
9
(12) The Strategic Air Command and Aero-
10
space Museum has not sought congressional funding 
11
for its facility and operations. 
12
(13) Thousands of donors across the Nation 
13
have contributed millions of dollars to help build this 
14
national institution, including individuals and foun-
15
dations. 
16
(14) The Strategic Air Command and Aero-
17
space Museum should always be the Nation’s mu-
18
seum of the American experience in the Cold War 
19
years (1946–1991) where people go to learn about 
20
this critical period and where the history of the Na-
21
tion’s monumental post-World War II responsibility 
22
will be preserved so that future generations may un-

(15) The Strategic Air Command and Aero-

space Museum seeks to educate a diverse group of 
4
audiences through its collection of artifacts, photo-
5
graphs, letters, documents, and firsthand personal 
6
accounts of the participants in the Cold War on the 
7
home front during one of history’s darkest hours. 
8
(16) The Strategic Air Command and Aero-
9
space Museum is devoted to the combat experience 
10
of the Nation’s citizen soldiers in all theaters of op-
11
eration and to the heroic efforts of the men and 
12
women domestically who supported the overt and 
13
covert operations from the period beginning in 1946 
14
and ending in 1991. 
15
(17) The Strategic Air Command and Aero-
16
space Museum continues to add to and maintain one 
17
of the Nation’s largest personal history collections of 
18
the men and women who participated in the Cold 
19
War.

21
such totality and depth, the span of time from the 
22
era of George F. Kennan to the collapse of the 
23
U.S.S.R. and the Cold War’s influence on pop cul-

(19) The Strategic Air Command and Aero-

space Museum is currently a 300,000-square-foot in-
4
stitution, including core exhibitions on the Cold War, 
5
Strategic Air Command, and Strategic Nuclear De-
6
terrence. 
7
(20) The Strategic Air Command and Aero-
8
space Museum is planning an expansion that will in-
9
clude a Missileers Hall and a large exhibition dedi-
10
cated to the men and women that served in the Cold 
11
War years and their families. 
12
(21) The planned Comprehensive Facility Rede-
13
velopment Plan will describe the role played by every 
14
State and territory during the Cold War years, and 
15
the database of the Strategic Air Command and 
16
Aerospace Museum’s exhibition program will be 
17
made available to the teachers and school children of 
18
every State and territory. 
19
(22) The Strategic Air Command and Aero-
20
space Museum is an official Smithsonian affiliate in-
21

22
nian artifacts for future exhibitions.

1
including the National Cryptologic Museum, the Na-
2
tional Reconnaissance Center for Interpretation, 
3
NASA Space Centers, and USAF Museum Program, 
4
among others. 
5
(24) As the Strategic Air Command’s motto 
6
was ‘‘Peace is our Profession’’, and the heraldry of 
7
the organization includes a Mailed Fist offering both 
8
Olive Branches and Thunderbolts, with the former 
9
headquarters and two major bases within a 50-mile 
10
radius. 
11
(25) The Strategic Air Command and Aero-
12
space Museum supports opportunities for ethical dis-
13
cussion of both nuclear and anti-nuclear defense pol-
14
icy within the context of the Cold War; as the literal 
15
and figurative epicenter or ‘‘ground zero’’ for an 
16
intercontinental thermonuclear exchange, the area 
17
represents our national tradition of free speech that 
18
simultaneously embraces both public support and 
19
protests. 
20
(26) As the Cold War did not ‘‘end’’ but was 
21
‘‘won’’, it is proper and fitting that the Strategic Air 
22
Command and Aerospace Museum, generally located 
23
near the geographical center of our great Republic 
24
in the breadbasket of the Nation, represents the cul-

1
tions relevant to the history of the Cold War. 
2
(27) The 1992 stand-down of the Strategic Air 
3
Command represented an awareness of the winning 
4
of the Cold War and transition to a changed inter-
5
national leadership role. 
6
(28) Academics and academic institutions have 
7
engaged the Strategic Air Command and Aerospace 
8
Museum favorably for research and advanced degree 
9
seminars regarding the Cuban Missile Crisis, Gen-
10
eral Curtis E. LeMay, the evolution of aerospace, 
11
and the Cold War, including— 
12
(A) the United States Army School of Ad-
13

(B) Sandia National Laboratories; and 
16
(C) Dr. James Blight and Dr. Janet Lang 
17

18

19

space Museum collaborates with other museums to 
22
share the current story of STRATCOM, Minuteman

4
United States Army Air Corps and then the United 
5

6
cluding—

9

10
Tuskegee Airman in the community);

12

United States Air Force as the first fully inte-
19
grated military branch; and 
20
(E) education involvement with community 
21

Strategic Air Command and Aerospace Museum as
