Whereas, in 1968, the United Nations International Con-
ference on Human Rights declared that ‘‘parents have a 
basic human right to determine freely and responsibly the 
number and spacing of their children’’; 
Whereas access to contraceptives in the United States is rec-
ognized as a fundamental right under the constitutional 
right to privacy through the Supreme Court’s decisions in 
Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965) and 
Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438 (1972); 
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) recognized family planning in its published list of 
the ‘‘Ten Greatest Public Health Achievements in the 
20th Century’’; 
Whereas target 3.7 of the United Nations Sustainable Devel-
opment Goals (SDGs), which was adopted by the United 
States and 192 other United Nations (UN) member 
states, calls on countries ‘‘by 2030, to ensure universal 
access to sexual and reproductive health-care services, in-
cluding for family planning, information and education, 
and the integration of reproductive health into national 
strategies and programs’’; 
Whereas contraception, specifically condoms, decreases the 
spread of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and 
could eliminate the 3.5 million annual cases of infertility 
in low- and middle-income countries that are caused by 
untreated gonorrhea or chlamydia; 
Whereas the ability of individuals to control the number and 
spacing of their children reduces rates of unwanted preg-
nancy; 
Whereas in developing countries, public health experts esti-
mate that access to contraceptives would result in 76 mil-

lion fewer unintended pregnancies, 26 million fewer un-
safe abortions, and 186,000 fewer maternal deaths; 
Whereas significant racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic dispari-
ties exist in sexual and reproductive health, particularly 
in maternal mortality and infant mortality with Black, 
American Indian, and Alaska Native women two to three 
times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes 
than White women; 
Whereas contraceptive choices are unduly influenced by struc-
tural racism, gender discrimination, and socioeconomic 
barriers, and research shows that both historically and 
today, medical racism has resulted in experiments on, ex-
ploitation of, and mistrust of Black women’s sexual and 
reproductive health; 
Whereas effective contraception has been shown to be an im-
portant strategy to maintaining and improving mental 
health and well-being for women, particularly in relation 
to postpartum depression from unplanned pregnancies; 
Whereas planning, delaying, and spacing births helps people 
achieve their education and career goals; 
Whereas young women with access to the pill before age 21 
graduated from college in significantly higher numbers 
than did women of the same era who came of age before 
the pill was available to them; 
Whereas children born to mothers with access to United 
States federally funded family planning programs, which 
increase access to affordable contraception and family 
planning services, were more likely to complete at least 
12, 13, and 16 years of schooling, and had two-percent 
higher family incomes as adults;

•HRES 685 IH 
Whereas globally, access to contraception increases labor 
force participation boosting economic health and pros-
perity of developing communities; 
Whereas many women face challenges in accessing birth con-
trol and using it effectively, and globally, 270 million 
women (14 percent) have an unmet need for family plan-
ning using modern contraception; 
Whereas in the United States, one-third of adult United 
States women who have ever tried to obtain prescription 
contraception reported barriers to access; 
Whereas 12 States in America allow some health care pro-
viders to refuse to provide services related to contracep-
tion; 
Whereas studies show that preventing teenagers from access-
ing contraceptives puts teens at risk of unintended preg-
nancies and sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV; 
Whereas 9 States in America have adopted restrictions on 
emergency contraception by excluding emergency contra-
ception from a State’s family planning program, contra-
ceptive coverage mandate, or by allowing pharmacists to 
refuse to dispense emergency contraceptives; 
Whereas according to the UN, globally, 19 percent of govern-
ments apply one or more restrictions on contraceptive ac-
cess, and these include restrictions on the age and mar-
ital status of the person seeking access to contraception, 
parental consent, and restrictions on access to emergency 
contraceptive pills or sterilization; 
Whereas researchers propose some women of color experience 
implicit and explicit racism when interacting with the 
medical system, lack of quality information about effec-

tive family planning methods, and an inability to access 
or afford reproductive health care; 
Whereas while comprehensive sex education has been proven 
to reduce rates of unintended pregnancy and STIs, only 
20 States and the District of Columbia require sex edu-
cation to include information on birth control; 
Whereas globally, many countries have made advances in de-
veloping policies to improve access to comprehensive sex 
education, however, there remain significant gaps be-
tween global and regional policies and implementation on 
the ground such as limited teacher training capacity; 
Whereas existing research highlights uninsured women were 
30 percent less likely to report using prescription contra-
ceptive methods than women with private or public health 
insurance and women identify affordability among the 
top three factors in determining which contraception to 
use; 
Whereas LGBTQ+ individuals, particularly transgender indi-
viduals undergoing transition, experience unique barriers 
to contraception access; 
Whereas there are continued efforts to defund or eliminate 
contraceptive programs, even though they are proven to 
reduce unintended pregnancies; 
Whereas reproductive justice is the human right to maintain 
personal bodily autonomy, have children, not have chil-
dren, and parent the children we have in safe and sus-
tainable communities; 
Whereas people of color, indigenous people, immigrant com-
munities, and people with disabilities have been exploited 
in the service of contraceptive development, and been co-
erced into using contraception, or sterilized against their

when they need it; and 
Whereas Congress has repeatedly recognized the importance 
of women’s ability to access contraceptives through sup-
port for the Medicaid program, title X of the Public 
Health Service Act, and the Federal Employee Health 
Benefits Program: Now, therefore, be it

15
ported separately (for example, the contraceptive

patch or vaginal ring);

(6) the House of Representatives and the Ad-
