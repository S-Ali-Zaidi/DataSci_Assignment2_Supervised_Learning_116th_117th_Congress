the World War II Memorial is the first national me-
4
morial dedicated to all who served during World 
5

6
achievement of the entire Nation.

(4) The Memorial honors the 16,000,000 who 
8
served in the Armed Forces of the United States 
9
during World War II, the more than 400,000 who 
10
died, and the millions who supported the war effort

world.
