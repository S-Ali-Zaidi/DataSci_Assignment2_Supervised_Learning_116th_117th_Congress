A BILL 
To improve United States consideration of, and strategic 
support for, programs to prevent and respond to gender- 
based violence beginning with the onset of humanitarian 
emergencies, to build the capacity of humanitarian assist-
ance to address the immediate and long-term challenges 
resulting from such violence, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Safe from the Start 
2
Act of 2021’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) Displaced, refugee, and stateless women and 
6
girls in humanitarian emergencies, conflict settings, 
7
and natural disasters face extreme violence and 
8
threats, including— 
9
(A) rape and sexual assault; 
10
(B) domestic or intimate partner violence; 
11
(C) child, early, and forced marriage; 
12
(D) trafficking for the purposes of sexual; 
13
(E) exploitation and forced labor; 
14
(F) harmful traditional practices such as 
15
female genital mutilation or cutting; and 
16
(G) harassment, exploitation, and abuse by 
17
humanitarian personnel. 
18
(2) Gender-based violence is known to increase 
19
during humanitarian emergencies. Violent acts such 
20
as intimate partner violence and child marriage that 
21
take place during times of stability are often exacer-
22
bated during times of crisis. 
23
(3) For example, according to the United Na-
24
tions Organization Stabilization Mission in the 
25
Democratic Republic of the Congo, there was an in-
26
00:23 Feb 20, 2021

•HR 571 IH
crease of 56 percent in reported cases of conflict-re-
1
lated sexual violence between 2016 and 2017. 
2
(4) Nearly 1 in 5 women report experiencing 
3
sexual violence during a humanitarian emergency. 
4
(5) Intimate partner violence is pervasive and 
5
becomes increasingly common during times of con-
6
flict and crisis. Residence in a conflict-affected dis-
7
trict is associated with a 50-percent increase in risk 
8
of intimate partner violence, and women who have 
9
experienced 4–5 cumulative years of conflict are al-
10
most 90 percent more likely to experience such vio-
11
lence than women who are not living in conflict set-
12
tings. 
13
(6) Child, early, and forced marriages increase 
14
during humanitarian crises and can be used as a 
15
tool of last resort to cope with economic hardship 
16
and to protect girls from increased violence. Conflict 
17
can exacerbate cultural norms of child, early, and 
18
forced marriage or create harmful cultural behaviors 
19
where they had not previously existed. 
20
(7) Women and girls are especially vulnerable 
21
to trafficking during humanitarian crises, particu-
22
larly by non-state armed groups who abduct and 
23
traffic women and girls for sexual exploitation, do-
24

•HR 571 IH
mestic servitude, and child, early, and forced mar-
1
riage, among other forms of exploitation. 
2
(8) The power imbalance between aid workers 
3
and displaced people, combined with the economic 
4
hardship caused by crises, creates markets for sexual 
5
exploitation and abuse that are too frequently 
6
abused by aid workers and peacekeepers seeking sex-
7
ual services from displaced or vulnerable people. 
8
(9) In 2018, the United Nations received a 
9
total of 148 sexual exploitation and abuse allegations 
10
directly involving United Nations aid workers, and 
11
111 involving staff from partner organizations im-
12
plementing United Nations programs. 
13
(10) According to United Nations High Com-
14
missioner for Refugees, while women and girls are 
15
most 
vulnerable 
to 
gender-based 
violence, 
16
marginalized populations are also at particular risk 
17
of gender-based violence in humanitarian crises, in-
18
cluding adolescent girls, older women, women and 
19
children with disabilities, sexual and gender minori-
20
ties, and female heads of households. 
21
(11) Gender-based violence is under-reported, 
22
both in times of stability and during crises. While 
23
data may not be immediately available in each crisis 
24
or conflict, evidence shows that gender-based vio-
25
00:23 Feb 20, 2021

•HR 571 IH
lence is consistently a major and pressing concern 
1
for women and girls facing humanitarian emergency 
2
contexts and should be assumed to be a protection 
3
concern in all humanitarian planning and risk as-
4
sessment, even in the absence of data. 
5
(12) Men and boys play a critical role in pre-
6
venting gender-based violence, and engaging them in 
7
prevention and accountability activities while empow-
8
ering women and girls in the transformation of gen-
9
der roles and combating harmful norms that lead to 
10
increased rates of gender-based violence at the onset 
11
of emergencies, leads to lasting results. 
12
(13) Survivors of gender-based violence during 
13
humanitarian emergencies and their families require 
14
immediate, life-saving assistance, including post-rape 
15
care or access to other comprehensive medical and 
16
psychosocial services, to address the physical, psy-
17
chological, and social impacts of gender-based vio-
18
lence. They also require long-term support such as 
19
opportunities to earn livelihoods, build skills or re-
20
ceive an education, and access to justice and com-
21
munity-level reintegration. Early medical interven-
22
tions after incidents of rape can help to prevent in-
23
fections, HIV, and pregnancy.

(15) 
The 
international 
community 
has 
9
prioritized addressing the issue of gender-based vio-
10
lence in humanitarian contexts by launching a Glob-
11
al Call to Action on Protection from Gender-Based 
12
Violence in Emergencies in 2013, which the United 
13
States implemented through establishing the ‘‘Safe 
14
from the Start’’ initiative, carried out by the Depart-
15
ment of State and the United States Agency for 
16
International Development. 
17
(16) Safe from the Start aimed to prevent and 
18
respond to gender-based violence at the onset of an 
19
emergency and to provide resources to strengthen 
20
the core capacity of humanitarian assistance imple-
21
menters to address gender-based violence at the ear-

liest phases of an emergency, including through sup-
23
porting the development of training, guidelines, tool-
