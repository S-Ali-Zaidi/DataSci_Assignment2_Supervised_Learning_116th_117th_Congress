Whereas, across the United States, clean and readily abun-
dant forms of energy are powering more homes and busi-
nesses than ever before; 
Whereas clean energy generation is readily available from 
zero- and low-emissions sources; 
Whereas the clean energy sector is a growing part of the 
economy and has been a key driver of economic growth 
in the United States in recent years; 
Whereas technological innovation can further reduce costs 
and increase deployment of clean energy sources; 
Whereas the 2021 report entitled ‘‘U.S. Energy and Employ-
ment Report’’ published by the Department of Energy 
found that, at the end of 2020, the energy and energy 
efficiency sectors in the United States employed approxi-
mately 7,500,000 individuals; 
Whereas the scaling of clean energy is essential to reducing 
harmful emissions; 
Whereas clean energy jobs are inherently local, contribute to 
the growth of local economies, and cannot be outsourced 
due to the onsite nature of construction, installation, and 
maintenance; and 
Whereas innovative clean energy solutions and clean energy 
jobs are part of the energy future of the United States: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
