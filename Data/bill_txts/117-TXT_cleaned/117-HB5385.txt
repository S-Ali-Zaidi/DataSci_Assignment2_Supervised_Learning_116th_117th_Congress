SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The United States is experiencing an ongo-
3
ing affordable housing crisis that the Federal Gov-
4
ernment has failed to adequately or proportionately 
5
address. The Harvard Housing Center found that 
6
01:55 Sep 29, 2021
H5385
3 
•HR 5385 IH
about half of all renters in the United States spent 
1
more than 30 percent of their incomes on rent and 
2
utilities, while 1 in 4 renters spent more than half 
3
their incomes on housing in 2018. Although devel-
4
opers have increased new home construction in re-
5
cent years, the impacts of increased supply have not 
6
alleviated pricing pressures evenly across income dis-
7
tributions. Often, housing developers focus new de-
8
velopment on the most profitable sectors, increasing 
9
construction in the luxury housing market and leav-
10
ing a void in affordable home construction. The most 
11
disadvantaged populations are left defenseless, with-
12
out affordable housing options and at risk of eviction 
13
and displacement due to rising rents. 
14
(2) In 2019, an average of 568,000 people ex-
15
perienced homelessness at a single point in time. De-
16
spite this large number of unhoused people in the 
17
United States, the housing choice voucher program, 
18
one of our most essential housing safety nets, had 
19
multi-year wait lists in many areas. The public hous-
20
ing agencies that administer these vouchers continue 
21
to experience serious underfunding since Congress 
22
has only provided funding for administrative ex-
23
penses prorated at 80 percent.

(3) The current housing affordability crisis does 
1
not impact all Americans equally—it is felt most 
2
acutely by people of color, and in particular African 
3
Americans, a testament to the lingering impacts of 
4
discriminatory housing policies. African Americans 
5
represent 40 percent of all people experiencing 
6
homelessness in the United States, while only ac-
7
counting for 13 percent of the United States popu-
8
lation. 
9
(4) In 1933, the Federal Government created 
10
the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation, which played 
11
a pivotal role in the development and racial segrega-
12
tion of the United States housing market, also 
13
known as redlining. By deeming certain neighbor-
14
hoods as hazardous and limiting investment in oth-
15
ers, the Federal Government firmly established ra-
16
cially segregated neighborhoods throughout the 
17
United States. 
18
(5) Predatory use of eminent domain in pre-
19
dominantly African-American neighborhoods was 
20
coupled by Federal urban renewal projects in the 
21
latter half of the 20th century, which cleared out 
22
homes and businesses throughout many of these 
23
communities. 
24
01:55 Sep 29, 2021
H5385

•HR 5385 IH
(6) Several areas of the United States saw an 
1
influx of African Americans migrating from the 
2
Deep South in pursuit of better economic opportuni-
3
ties. The Federal Government and State and local 
4
municipalities and their policies heavily influenced 
5
where this population settled. 
6
(7) Historical restrictions on homeownership 
7
have driven disparate impacts for Black Americans, 
8
indigenous people, and people of color across most 
9
sectors of social existence. In the fourth quarter of 
10
2018, the homeownership rate among Black Ameri-
11
cans was 43.6 percent, while the Hispanic homeown-
12
ership rate was 46.9 percent. In comparison, the 
13
White (non-Hispanic) homeownership rate was 73.6 
14
percent in the fourth quarter of 2018, more than the 
15
all-minority homeownership rate. Creating policies 
16
and programs that encourage homeownership for the 
17
most disadvantaged is necessary to achieve equitable 
18
outcomes for all people in the United States. 
19
(8) Generations of African Americans have been 
20
systematically displaced and that legacy is still felt 
21
by descendants today. 
22
(9) Despite these clear and documented pat-
23
terns, the Federal Government has not dedicated 
24
significant attention and resources to remedy the 
25
01:55 Sep 29, 2021
H5385
6 
•HR 5385 IH
historical legacies of redlining, urban renewal, and 
1
other explicitly and intentionally racist housing poli-
2
cies. 
3
(10) Housing impacts education policy and out-
4
comes. Low-income students who lack a quality edu-
5
cation are less likely to pursue education or training 
6
beyond high school, and thus more likely to live in 
7
low-income neighborhoods. Schools with a large con-
8
centration of low-income students are classified as 
9
title I schools, and in 2016, the largest racial demo-
10
graphic in those schools were African-American chil-
11
dren, followed by White children. Generally, school 
12
districts are largely funded by local property taxes, 
13
and low-income neighborhoods have lower home val-
14
ues. School districts are therefore unable to provide 
15
a high quality education to their students. The prop-
16
erty value funding mechanism perpetuates a system-
17
atic cycle that keeps low-income African-American 
18
people in poverty, with very little opportunity for up-
19
ward mobility. Some States have tried to wrestle 
20
with this systematic cycle by redesigning the funding 
21
formula, yet the lasting implications of inequitable 
22
funding structures remain. 
23
(11) Data demonstrates that communities of 
24
color and low-income families experience the adverse 
25
01:55 Sep 29, 2021
H5385
7 
•HR 5385 IH
consequence of displacement the most due to Fed-
1
eral, State, and local inequitable housing policies. As 
2
a result, disparities have occurred, diminishing or 
3
outright denying opportunities to obtain homeowner-
4
ship and access to generational wealth within these 
5
means. As living preferences change, current trends 
6
demonstrate that urban areas once comprised of 
7
higher concentrations of low income people and peo-
8
ple of color have become more desirable and sought 
9
after by affluent people with different identities of 
10
those displaced—this is also known as gentrification. 
11
(12) Congress should address and continue to 
12
study the ramifications of structural racism and so-
13
cial class disparities within Federal housing policies. 
14
This can be done by targeting displacement, home-
15
lessness, housing affordability, enforcing tenant pro-
16
tections, providing landlords with incentives to par-
17
ticipate in affordable housing programs, and facili-
18
tating access to resources that lead to homeowner-
19
ship. 
20
(13) This Act aims to address the shortcomings 
21
of our current housing policies and funding levels by 
22
holistically addressing disparities and systematic ob-
23
stacles and ensuring an equitable outcome for the 
24
most vulnerable Americans.
