SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) As of 2019, more than 54,000,000 Ameri-
3
cans were age 65 or older. By 2030, the Census Bu-
4
reau projects that one in five Americans will be 65 
5
or older. More than 80 percent of older Americans 
6
suffer from chronic conditions which require person- 
7
centered, coordinated care that helps them to live in 
8
a home- or community-based setting. In 2012, the 
9
Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that 
10
34 percent of Americans who are age 60 or older re-
11
ported needing assistance performing activities of 
12
daily living. According to a 2015 GAO report, be-
13
tween 67 and 78 percent of older adults who likely 
14
need home-based care receive limited or no help with 
15
their difficulties. 
16
(2) Direct-care workers (referred to in this sec-
17
tion as ‘‘DCWs’’) provide an estimated 70 to 80 per-
18
cent of the paid hands-on long-term care and per-
19
sonal assistance received by elders and people with 
20
disabilities or other chronic conditions in the United 
21
States. These workers help their clients bathe, dress, 
22
and negotiate a range of other daily tasks. They are 
23
a lifeline for those they serve, as well as for families 
24
and friends struggling to provide high-quality care.

•HR 6149 IH
(3) Eldercare and disability services positions 
1
account for nearly one-third of the 18,000,000 
2
health care jobs in the United States. The direct- 
3
care workforce alone accounts for nearly 4,600,000 
4
jobs and is expected to add nearly 1,300,000 new 
5
positions within the next decade. 
6
(4) The majority of DCWs are now employed in 
7
home- and community-based settings, and not in in-
8
stitutional settings such as nursing care facilities or 
9
hospitals. In 2019, DCWs providing home-based 
10
care already outnumbered DCWs in nursing homes 
11
by more than 4 to 1. 
12
(5) A 2008 Institute of Medicine report, enti-
13
tled ‘‘Re-tooling for an Aging America: Building the 
14
Health Care Workforce’’, called for new models of 
15
care delivery and coordination, and dedicated a 
16
chapter to the central importance of the direct-care 
17
workforce in a ‘‘re-tooled’’ eldercare delivery system. 
18
(6) An Institute of Medicine report on the fu-
19
ture of nursing, released in 2016, recommended 
20
nurses should practice to the full extent of their edu-
21
cation and training. The report also states that all 
22
health care professionals should work collaboratively 
23
in team-based models, and that the goal should be 
24
to encourage care models that use every member of 
25

•HR 6149 IH
the team to the full capacity of his or her training 
1
and skills. 
2
(7) The Patient Protection and Affordable Care 
3
Act (Public Law 111–148) emphasizes the need for 
4
improving care and lowering costs by better coordi-
5
nation of care and integration of services, particu-
6
larly for consumers with multiple chronic conditions. 
7
This has required developing new models of care for 
8
those receiving long-term services and supports.
