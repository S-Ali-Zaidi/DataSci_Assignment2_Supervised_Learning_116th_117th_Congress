(4) 25 convicted rapists are sentenced to some form 
of incarceration; 
Whereas on average, in the last 5 years 463,632 Americans 
aged 12 and over experienced sexual violence, according 
to the Department of Justice; 
Whereas nearly 1 in 5 women, or 21.3 percent, and 1 in 38 
men, or 2.6 percent, surveyed in the United States in 
2015 experienced a rape or attempted rape at some time 
in their lives, according to the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention; 
Whereas sexual violence is a burden for many individuals who 
serve in the United States Armed Forces, and the De-
partment of Defense estimates that in 2018, approxi-
mately 20,500 servicemembers experienced some form of 
sexual assault; 
Whereas children and young adults are at significant risk of 
sexual assault, as up to 44 percent of sexual assault vic-
tims are under 18 years of age, and the majority of sex-
ual assault victims are under 30 years of age; 
Whereas according to the Child Maltreatment Survey of 
2019, child protective services agencies substantiated, or 
found strong evidence to indicate, that 60,927 children 
under 18 years of age were victims of sexual abuse;

LGBTQ communities, commercial sex trafficking, sexual 
harassment, and stalking; 
Whereas according to a 2010 Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention survey, approximately 1 in 8 lesbian 
women (13 percent), nearly half of bisexual women (46 
percent), and 1 in 6 heterosexual women (17 percent) 
have been raped in their lifetimes, and this translates to 
an estimated 214,000 lesbian women, 1,500,000 bisexual 
women, and 19,000,000 heterosexual women; 
Whereas in addition to the immediate physical and emotional 
costs of sexual assault, sexual assault has numerous ad-
verse consequences, which can include post-traumatic 
stress disorder, substance abuse, major depression, home-
lessness, eating disorders, and suicide, according to the 
National Alliance to End Sexual Violence; 
Whereas many sexual assaults are not reported to law en-
forcement agencies, and many States have restrictive 
criminal statutes of limitations, which enable many rap-
ists to evade prosecution for their crimes; 
Whereas approximately 68 percent of sexual crimes are com-
mitted by individuals who are known to the victim; 
Whereas sexual assault survivors suffer emotional scars long 
after the physical scars have healed; 
Whereas DNA technology has enabled perpetrators to be 
identified and prosecuted in many rape cases; 
Whereas national, State, territorial, and Tribal coalitions, 
community-based rape crisis centers, and other organiza-
tions across the United States are committed to— 
(1) serving survivors of sexual violence; 
(2) eliminating sexual violence through prevention 
and education; and

Violence, at least 62 percent of rape crisis centers have 
a waiting list for counseling services and rely on Federal, 
State, and local funding sources to provide services to 
survivors and prevention activities in their communities; 
Whereas student survivors in K–12 and postsecondary edu-
cation need access to accommodations and support, and 
schools have a responsibility to respond to and prevent 
sexual violence; 
Whereas important partnerships have been formed among 
criminal and juvenile justice agencies, health profes-
sionals, public health workers, educators, first respond-
ers, and victim service providers; 
Whereas thousands of volunteers and staff at rape crisis cen-
ters, State coalitions against sexual assault, and non-
profit organizations across the United States play an im-
portant role in making crisis hotlines and other services 
available to survivors of sexual assault; 
Whereas free, confidential help is available to all victims and 
survivors of sexual assault through— 
(1) the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network’s 
(RAINN) victim service programs, including the National 
Sexual Assault Hotline (800–656–HOPE and on-
line.rainn.org), which helped a total of 60,437 people in 
May and June of 2020 alone, up 18 percent from the 
same period in 2019; and

to prevent all forms of sexual violence; and

feel that there is no path to justice; 
Whereas in the last year the powerful stories of sexual as-
sault survivors have brought attention to the importance 
of addressing sexual violence to the forefront of our soci-
ety; and 
Whereas April 2021 is recognized as ‘‘National Sexual As-
sault Awareness and Prevention Month’’: Now, therefore,
