(b) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
1
(1) Certain negative events, circumstances, or 
2
maltreatment to which children may be exposed, 
3
known as adverse childhood experiences, are associ-
4
ated with negative health outcomes. 
5
(2) Childhood psychological, physical, or sexual 
6
abuse; household challenges such as violence, sub-
7
stance use, mental illness, separation or divorce, or 
8
incarceration of a family member; and emotional or 
9
physical neglect have been shown to negatively im-
10
pact a person’s long-term health and well-being. 
11
(3) Adverse childhood experiences and associ-
12
ated conditions such as living in under-resourced or 
13
racially segregated neighborhoods, frequently mov-
14
ing, experiencing food insecurity, and other insta-
15
bility can cause toxic stress, a prolonged activation 
16
of the stress-response system. 
17
(4) Experiencing one or more adverse childhood 
18
experiences is associated with higher risks of some 
19
of the leading causes of death and disability in the 
20
United States. 
21
(5) More than half of all Americans have expe-
22
rienced one or more adverse childhood experiences.

as a major public health concern and made it a pri-
1
ority area for focus in the National Center for In-
2
jury Prevention and Control at the Centers for Dis-
3
ease Control and Prevention. 
4
(7) Further research is needed to better define 
5
adverse childhood experiences, understand the causal 
6
pathway between adverse childhood experiences and 
7
physical health outcomes, and identify protective fac-
8
tors against adverse childhood experiences and their 
9
effects, in order to inform and improve current pro-
10
grams and future efforts to promote public health. 
11
(8) Evidence-based prevention and mitigation 
12
strategies to address adverse childhood experiences 
13
have been identified, but efforts are needed to facili-
14
tate implementation in communities.
