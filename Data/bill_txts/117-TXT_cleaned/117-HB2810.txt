•HR 2810 IH
(1) the United States must make significant in-
1
vestments to install, upgrade, or replace the public 
2
works infrastructure of the United States; 
3
(2) with respect to investments in the infra-
4
structure of the United States, taxpayers expect that 
5
their public works infrastructure will be produced in 
6
the United States by American workers; 
7
(3) United States taxpayer dollars invested in 
8
public infrastructure should not be used to reward 
9
companies that have moved their operations, invest-
10
ment dollars, and jobs to foreign countries or foreign 
11
factories, particularly those that do not share or 
12
openly flout the commitments of the United States 
13
to environmental, worker, and workplace safety pro-
14
tections; 
15
(4) in procuring materials for public works 
16
projects, entities using taxpayer-financed Federal as-
17
sistance should give a commonsense procurement 
18
preference for the materials and products produced 
19
by companies and workers in the United States in 
20
accordance with the high ideals embodied in the en-
21
vironmental, worker, workplace safety, and other 
22
regulatory requirements of the United States;

24
extend beyond economics;

(6) by incentivizing domestic manufacturing, 
1
domestic content preferences reinvest tax dollars in 
2
companies and processes using the highest labor and 
3
environmental standards in the world; 
4
(7) strong domestic content preference policies 
5
act to prevent shifts in production to countries that 
6
rely on production practices that are significantly 
7
less energy efficient and far more polluting than 
8
those in the United States; 
9
(8) for over 75 years, Buy America and other 
10
domestic preference laws have been part of the 
11
United States procurement policy, ensuring that the 
12
United States can build and rebuild the infrastruc-
13
ture of the United States with high-quality Amer-
14
ican-made materials; 
15
(9) Buy America laws create demand for do-
16
mestically produced goods, helping to sustain and 
17
grow domestic manufacturing and the millions of 
18
jobs domestic manufacturing supports throughout 
19
product supply chains; 
20
(10) as of the date of enactment of this Act, 
21
domestic procurement preference policies apply to all 
22
Federal Government procurement and to various 
23
Federal-aid infrastructure programs;

(11) a robust domestic manufacturing sector is 
1
a vital component of the national security of the 
2
United States; 
3
(12) as more manufacturing operations of the 
4
United States have moved offshore, the strength and 
5
readiness of the defense industrial base of the 
6
United States has been diminished; and 
7
(13) domestic procurement preference laws— 
8
(A) are fully consistent with the inter-
9
national obligations of the United States; and 
10
(B) together with the government procure-
11
ments to which the laws apply, are important 
12
levers for ensuring that United States manufac-
13
turers can access the government procurement 
14
markets of the trading partners of the United
