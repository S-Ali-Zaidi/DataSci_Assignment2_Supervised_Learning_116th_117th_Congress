date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the 
7
Environmental Protection Agency in consultation with 
8
Secretary of Transportation and other relevant Federal 
9
agencies determined by the Administrator, shall establish 
10
a 3-year pilot grant program with eligible entities to meas-
11
ure noise and emissions, including greenhouse gases, par-
12
ticulate matter, ultrafine particles, and other toxic pollut-
13
ants, in communities near airports or air flight pathways 
14
using sophisticated methods and technology that allow 
15
tracing of noise and emissions to specific sources such as 
16
aircraft and airport related noise and emissions near such 
17
communities, including identifying specific neighborhoods, 
18
structures, or areas impacted by such noise and emissions. 
19
(b) GRANT ACTIVITIES.—Recipients of grants under 
20
subsection (a) shall— 
21
(1) use technology capable of producing data 
22
that can be used for wedge analysis to decipher the 
23
sources of noise and emissions so communities may 
24
better understand the primary contributors of noise 
25
and emissions;

17
the grantee determines useful to the project; 
18
(5) work with community-based organizations, 
19
some of which may be selected for a grant under
