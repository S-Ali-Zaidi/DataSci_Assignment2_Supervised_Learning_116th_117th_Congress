RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the United States should support, and not limit access 
to, all domestic sources of energy development in an 
effort to achieve full energy security. 
Whereas, in 2018, 29 percent of all United States petroleum 
imports came from countries that belong to the Organiza-
tion of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), in-
cluding the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia; 
Whereas due to OPEC’s outsized share of the global petro-
leum market, any instability in one of its member coun-
tries can directly impact global energy markets;

Whereas thanks to the United States energy renaissance, 
more oil and natural gas are being produced domestically 
than by any other nation in the world; 
Whereas the United States energy industry is a leader in cre-
ating and supporting new, high-quality jobs; 
Whereas technological advances in the domestic energy indus-
try have resulted in large reductions in the dispersal of 
harmful pollutants into the environment; 
Whereas nuclear power has supplied approximately one-fifth 
of annual United States electricity since 1990 and pro-
vides approximately 60 percent of the carbon-free elec-
tricity of the United States; 
Whereas renewable sources of energy account for 11 percent 
of domestic energy consumption; 
Whereas the United States has abundant coal reserves, in-
cluding a demonstrated reserve base estimated to contain 
475 billion short tons; 
Whereas it is in the national security interests of the United 
States to control its own energy supply; 
Whereas the Biden administration has taken Executive ac-
tions to limit the productivity of American energy pro-
ducers in the oil and natural gas sectors, putting at risk 
the United States goal of securing its energy future; 
Whereas these Executive actions will increase the demand for 
foreign sources of energy, which tend to be dirtier and 
subject to fewer safety and environmental regulations; 
and 
Whereas these Executive actions would result in American 
job losses and threaten the $11.7 billion tax revenue 
stream that funds critical health care and educational
