Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Haliwa-Saponi Indian 
4
Tribe of North Carolina Recognition Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) The Haliwa-Saponi Indian Tribe of North 
8
Carolina is a confederated Tribe that is a political 
9
successor to the historical Saponi Nation and to the 
10

•HR 9536 IH
Nansemond and affiliated Tribes that inhabited the 
1
Piedmont and coastal regions of what are now Vir-
2
ginia and North Carolina. 
3
(2) ‘‘Haliwa’’ is a geographical designation that 
4
is derived from the physical location of the Tribe, 
5
which is primarily in Halifax and Warren Counties, 
6
North Carolina. 
7
(3) In North Carolina, in 1733, the Saponi Na-
8
tion made peace with the Tuscarora and moved to 
9
a portion of the Tuscarora reservation in modern 
10
Bertie County, North Carolina, occupying a village 
11
known as Sapona Town. 
12
(4) In 1754, Captain William Hurst observed 
13
the residence of Saponi warriors and many women 
14
and children on Colonel William Eaton’s lands in the 
15
Granville District (modern Granville, Warren, and 
16
Vance Counties, North Carolina). 
17
(5) In 1761, the Saponi Indians were living on 
18
10,000 acres of land in the Granville District on and 
19
near the Roanoke River (modern-day Warren Coun-
20
ty, North Carolina), along with the Meherrin and 
21
Tuscarora. 
22
(6) In Virginia, as acknowledged by Congress in 
23
the Thomasina E. Jordan Indian Tribes of Virginia 
24
Federal Recognition Act of 2017 (Public Law 115– 
25

121; 132 Stat. 59 et seq.), there were two sections 
1
of the Nansemond Tribe, one of which remained in 
2
Virginia and was accorded Federal recognition in 
3
2018 concurrently with five other Tribes still resi-
4
dent in Virginia by that same statute. 
5
(7) Another section of the Nansemond Tribe 
6
had migrated to North Carolina due to hostilities in 
7
Virginia, and today enrolled citizens of the Haliwa- 
8
Saponi Indian Tribe include lineal descendants of 
9
those Nansemond. 
10
(8) After the American Revolution (1775– 
11
1783), the Nansemond and Saponi merged together 
12
for mutual protection and survival in Halifax, War-
13
ren, Nash, and Franklin Counties, in an area known 
14
as ‘‘The Meadows’’. 
15
(9) Among the surrounding communities, the 
16
Haliwa-Saponi Indian Tribe has often been referred 
17
to as the ‘‘Meadows Indians’’. 
18
(10) In 1889, Warren County, North Carolina 
19
resident G.B. Alston wrote to the Smithsonian Insti-
20
tution anthropologist James Mooney and confirmed 
21
the residence of a Tribe of 300–600 Indians in the 
22
Meadows in Halifax and Warren Counties.

(11) The Tribe has continually existed as a sep-
1
arate community, with leaders exhibiting clear polit-
2
ical authority. 
3
(12) While local non-Indians recognized the In-
4
dian and Tribal identity of the Haliwa-Saponi, oth-
5
ers insisted on classifying Tribal citizens as ‘‘col-
6
ored’’ rather than Indian, due to segregation. 
7
(13) During the era of school segregation, the 
8
Tribe opened its own school, the Haliwa Indian 
9
School, operated with the Tribe’s own funds. 
10
(14) Since 1957 the State of North Carolina 
11
has had continuous dealings with the recognized po-
12
litical leaders of the Haliwa-Saponi. 
13
(15) In 1957, the Tribe opened the Haliwa In-
14
dian School. 
15
(16) Between 1960 and 1963, students from 
16
the Haliwa-Saponi Indian Tribe attended Bacone 
17
College for Indians in Muscogee, Oklahoma. 
18
(17) In 1965, the Haliwa-Saponi Indian Tribe 
19
won a lawsuit against the North Carolina Division 
20
of Vital Statistics to correct the race of Haliwa- 
21
Saponi citizens on official records to read ‘‘Indian’’. 
22
(18) In 1965 the State of North Carolina took 
23
formal legislative action recognizing the Haliwa- 
24
Saponi Indian Tribe.

(19) In the early 1970s, local public school dis-
1
tricts started receiving Federal funds from the De-
2
partment of Education, Office of Indian Education, 
3
for Haliwa-Saponi Indian students. 
4
(20) In 1998, the Haliwa-Saponi Indian Tribe 
5
began receiving a formula allocation from the De-
6
partment of Housing and Urban Development, Na-
7
tive American Housing Assistance and Self Deter-
8
mination Act. 
9
(21) In 2000, the Tribe opened the Haliwa- 
10
Saponi Tribal School, a charter school under the 
11
State of North Carolina, at the location of the origi-
12
nal Haliwa Indian School, and the school currently 
13
receives Federal funds from the Department of Edu-
14
cation, Office of Indian Education for Haliwa- 
15
Saponi Indian students.
