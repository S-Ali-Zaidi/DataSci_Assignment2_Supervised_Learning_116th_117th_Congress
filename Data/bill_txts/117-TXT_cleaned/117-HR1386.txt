Whereas clean energy generation is readily available from 
zero- and low-emissions sources; 
Whereas the clean energy sector is a growing part of the 
economy and has been a key driver of economic growth 
in the United States in recent years; 
Whereas technological innovation can further reduce costs, 
enhance reliability, and increase deployment of clean en-
ergy sources; 
Whereas the 2022 report entitled ‘‘United States Energy and 
Employment Report’’ published by the Department of 
Energy found that, at the end of 2021, the energy and 
energy efficiency sectors in the United States employed 
approximately 7,800,000 individuals; 
Whereas the scaling of affordable and exportable clean energy 
is essential to reducing global emissions; 
Whereas clean energy jobs are inherently local, contribute to 
the growth of local economies, and cannot be outsourced 
due to the onsite nature of construction, installation, and 
maintenance; 
Whereas innovative clean energy solutions and clean energy 
jobs are part of the energy future of the United States; 
and 
Whereas September 26 through September 30, 2022, should 
be considered ‘‘National Clean Energy Week’’: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
