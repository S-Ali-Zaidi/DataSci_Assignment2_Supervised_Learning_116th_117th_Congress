Whereas national marine sanctuaries are living laboratories

resource management and advance innovative public-pri-

Whereas national marine sanctuaries can help make the 
ocean and Great Lakes more resilient by protecting eco-
systems that sequester carbon, safeguarding coastal com-
munities from flooding and storms, and protecting bio-
diversity;
