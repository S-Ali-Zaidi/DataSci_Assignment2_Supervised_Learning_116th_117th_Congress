SEC. 2. ALTERNATIVE FUEL AND LOW-EMISSION AVIATION 
1
TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM. 
2
(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—The Secretary of Transpor-
3
tation, in consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture, 
4
the Secretary of Energy, and the Administrator of the En-
5
vironmental Protection Agency, shall establish a competi-
6
tive grant program to provide grants to eligible entities 
7
to carry out projects located in the United States that 
8
produce, transport, blend, or store sustainable aviation 
9
fuel, or develop, demonstrate, or apply low-emission avia-
10
tion technologies. 
11
(b) CONSIDERATIONS.—In carrying out subsection 
12
(a), the Secretary shall consider, with respect to a pro-
13
posed project— 
14
(1) the capacity for the eligible entity to in-
15
crease the domestic production and deployment of 
16
sustainable aviation fuel or the use of low-emission 
17
aviation technologies among the United States com-
18
mercial aviation and aerospace industry; 
19
(2) the projected greenhouse gas emissions 
20
from such project, including emissions resulting 
21
from the development of the project, and the poten-
22
tial the project has to reduce or displace, on a 
23
lifecycle basis, United States greenhouse gas emis-
24
sions associated with air travel; 
25

(3) the capacity to create new jobs and develop 
1
supply chain partnerships in the United States; 
2
(4) for projects related to the production of sus-
3
tainable aviation fuel, the projected lifecycle green-
4
house gas emissions benefits from the proposed 
5
project, which shall include feedstock and fuel pro-
6
duction and potential direct and indirect greenhouse 
7
gas emissions (including resulting from changes in 
8
land use); and 
9
(5) the benefits of ensuring a diversity of feed-
10
stocks for sustainable aviation fuel, including the use 
11
of waste carbon oxides and direct air capture. 
12
(c) FUEL EMISSIONS REDUCTION TEST.—For pur-
13
poses of clause (ii) of subsection (f)(7)(E), the Secretary 
14
shall, not later than 1 year after the date of enactment 
15
of this section, adopt at least 1 methodology for testing 
16
lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions that meets the require-
17
ments of such clause. 
18
(d) FUNDING.— 
19
(1) AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.—Out 
20
of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appro-
21
priated, there are authorized to be appropriated for 
22
each 
of 
fiscal 
years 
2023 
through 
2027, 
23
$200,000,000 to carry out the purposes of this sec-

(2) FUNDING DISTRIBUTION.—Subject to para-
1
graph (4), of any amount made available under 
2
paragraph (1)— 
3
(A) 30 percent of such amount shall be 
4
awarded for projects that develop, demonstrate, 
5
or apply low-emission aviation technologies; and

the cost of a project carried out using a grant pro-
11
vided under this section may not exceed 90 percent 
12

13
consider the extent to which a proposed project 
14

15
in determining the Federal share under this para-
16
graph. 
17
(4) ADMINISTRATION.—The Secretary may re-
