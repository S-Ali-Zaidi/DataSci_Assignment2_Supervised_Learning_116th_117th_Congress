A BILL 
To provide for the coverage of medically necessary food and 
vitamins and individual amino acids for digestive and 
inherited metabolic disorders under Federal health pro-
grams and private health insurance, to ensure State and 
Federal protection for existing coverage, and for other 
purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Medical Nutrition Eq-
2
uity Act of 2021’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) Each year, thousands of children and adults 
6
in the United States are diagnosed with certain di-
7
gestive or inherited metabolic disorders that prevent 
8
their bodies from digesting or metabolizing the food 
9
they need to survive. For them, medically necessary 
10
food, which can often be administered as an orally 
11
consumed formula, is their treatment. 
12
(2) Without medically necessary food, these pa-
13
tients risk malnutrition, surgery, and repeated hos-
14
pitalizations. They may suffer intellectual disability 
15
or even death. Risks in pediatric populations are 
16
particularly profound and often severe and also in-
17
clude inadequate growth, abnormal development, 
18
cognitive impairment, and behavioral disorders. Spe-
19
cialized medically necessary food is standard-of-care 
20
therapy for these patients and is essential to pre-
21
venting such outcomes. 
22
(3) While not every person diagnosed with these 
23
conditions needs to be treated with medically nec-
24
essary food for a prolonged period, it is critical that 
25
patients and their physicians be able to consider the 
26
17:17 Jun 29, 2021

•HR 3783 IH
full range of options and select the treatment that 
1
will be most effective for each patient. 
2
(4) Insurance companies will typically cover 
3
pharmaceuticals or biologics for treatment of many 
4
of these conditions, if there is a therapy approved by 
5
the Food and Drug Administration. However, these 
6
types of treatments may not be the first-line therapy 
7
a physician would recommend, do not work for all 
8
patients, and can have undesirable risks, such as 
9
cancer or suppression of the immune system, which 
10
can increase a patient’s risk of infection. 
11
(5) Even when an insurance company does 
12
cover medically necessary food, it can come with the 
13
stipulation the formula be administered through a 
14
feeding tube, placed through the nose into the stom-
15
ach or surgically placed directly into the stomach or 
16
jejunum, even if a patient is capable of taking the 
17
formula orally without these devices. Surgical place-
18
ment of feeding tubes unnecessarily results in in-
19
creased risk to the patient and increased cost to the 
20
health care system. 
21
(6) Testing for select inherited metabolic dis-
22
orders is required in all States, and approximately 
23
2,000 babies per year are diagnosed with one of 
24
these disorders that requires treatment through 
25

medically necessary food. Yet, policies on medically 
1
necessary food vary significantly and do not always 
2
make it possible for families to get sufficient nutri-
3
tion for their affected children which can lead to de-
4
layed development, brain damage, and even death. 
5
(7) The worsening of food insecurity during the 
6
COVID–19 pandemic has had a significant impact 
7
on patients who rely on medical nutrition, and the 
8
cost of meeting their dietary needs has been a major 
9
burden to individuals facing financial challenges as 
10
a result of the pandemic.
