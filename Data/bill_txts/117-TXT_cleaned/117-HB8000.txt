A BILL 
To provide incentives for States to recover fraudulently paid 
Federal and State unemployment compensation, and for 
other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Chase COVID Unem-

Congress finds the following:

•HR 8000 IH
(1) Throughout the COVID–19 pandemic crimi-
1
nal organizations, including international cybercrime 
2
rings and opportunistic foreign actors, exploited a 
3
national crisis to steal billions from American tax-
4
payers. Fraud delayed legitimate payments to unem-
5
ployed workers and turned thousands of Americans 
6
into unwitting identity theft victims. 
7
(2) The size, scope, and severity of pandemic 
8
unemployment fraud is not fully known. 
9
(3) The Labor Department’s Office of the In-
10
spector General estimates that at least $163 billion 
11
of the $872.5 billion in Federal-State unemployment 
12
benefits paid during the pandemic could have been 
13
improperly paid, with a significant portion attrib-
14
utable to fraud. Just over $4 billion of these funds 
15
have been recovered. 
16
(4) The White House has estimated an 18.71 
17
percent improper payment rate in the Federal-State 
18
unemployment insurance program in fiscal year 
19
2021. This estimate does not include improper pay-
20
ments made in the Pandemic Unemployment Assist-
21
ance program, nor does it include the period of 
22
greatest fraudulent activity when generous $600 
23
weekly Federal supplements made unemployment a 
24
lucrative target for fraudsters.

•HR 8000 IH
(5) According to the Government Accountability 
1
Office, from March 2020 through October 2021, 145 
2
individuals pleaded guilty to Federal charges of de-
3
frauding unemployment insurance programs and 
4
Federal charges are pending against 250 individuals. 
5
(6) As of January 2022, the Labor Depart-
6
ment’s Inspector General reported opening more 
7
than 31,000 investigative matters involving alleged 
8
unemployment fraud and reported that it assisted 
9
other Federal and State agencies in identifying and 
10
recovering more than $565 million in fraudulently 
11
stolen unemployment benefits. 
12
(7) In California, State workforce officials con-
13
firmed they paid out fraudulent unemployment 
14
claims totaling $11 billion and identified another 
15
$20 billion in claims still under investigation. 
16
(8) The Pandemic Response Accountability 
17
Committee published a report compiling the results 
18
of investigations from 16 State auditors, finding $39 
19
billion in pandemic unemployment fraud. 
20
(9) There is growing evidence that criminal 
21
groups perpetrating unemployment fraud pose a 
22
threat to national security. 
23
(10) According to the Department of Justice 
24
and U.S. Secret Service, a significant amount of 
25
22:57 Jun 23, 2022

•HR 8000 IH
fraud was driven by known transnational organized 
1
criminal networks, including cartels with origins in 
2
countries including China, Ghana, Nigeria, Romania, 
3
and Russia. 
4
(11) The Department of Justice reports that 
5
the International Organized Crime Intelligence Op-
6
erations Center has referred a large number of un-
7
employment fraud cases to the Federal Bureau of 
8
Investigation. 
9
(12) The American people expect Congress to 
10
be an effective steward of taxpayer dollars and vigi-
11
lant in pursuit and recovery of funds when taxpayer 
12
dollars are improperly paid. 
13
(13) Congress has a responsibility to gain res-
14
titution for American taxpayers by ensuring aggres-
15
sive identification, investigation, and prosecution of 
16
criminal fraud in pandemic unemployment pro-
17
grams.
