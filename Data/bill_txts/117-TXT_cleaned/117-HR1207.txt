Whereas confirming the gravity of the catastrophe, the Presi-
dent issued an emergency declaration for the State of 
Florida on June 25, 2021, authorizing the Federal Emer-
gency Management Agency (FEMA) to coordinate the re-
sponse and recovery effort and to supplement State and 
local resources; 
Whereas first responders and emergency response profes-
sionals at the Federal, State, and local levels responded 
to the tragedy, searching the wreckage for survivors and 
remains of deceased residents and worked to reunite fam-
ilies; 
Whereas countless generous volunteers, charitable organiza-
tions, and individual donors have contributed to support 
the Surfside community; 
Whereas while dozens of Champlain Towers South residents 
were thankfully reunified with friends and family, 98 peo-
ple tragically lost their lives in the collapse; 
Whereas survivors, victims’ friends and family, first respond-
ers, and members of the local community have experi-
enced severe emotional trauma, as many have lost loved 
ones, homes, pets, or cherished personal belongings; and

ards and Technology (NIST) with $22,000,000 to initiate 
a technical investigation into the causes of the partial col-
lapse of the Champlain Towers South condominiums and 
the inquiry is ongoing: Now, therefore, be it
