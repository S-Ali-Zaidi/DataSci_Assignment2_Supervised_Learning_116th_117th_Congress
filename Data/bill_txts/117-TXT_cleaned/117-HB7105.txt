Section 519B of the Public Health Service Act (42

U.S.C. 290bb–25b) is amended by striking subsections (a) 
4
through (f) and inserting the following: 
5
‘‘(a) DEFINITIONS.—For purposes of this section: 
6
‘‘(1) The term ‘alcohol beverage industry’ 
7
means the brewers, vintners, distillers, importers, 
8
distributors, and retail or online outlets that sell or 
9
serve beer, wine, and distilled spirits. 
10
‘‘(2) The term ‘school-based prevention’ means 
11
programs, which are institutionalized, and run by 
12
staff members or school-designated persons or orga-
13
nizations in any grade of school, kindergarten 
14
through 12th grade. 
15
‘‘(3) The term ‘youth’ means persons under the 
16
age of 21. 
17
‘‘(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of the 
18
Congress that: 
19
‘‘(1) A multifaceted effort is needed to more 
20
successfully address the problem of underage drink-
21
ing in the United States. A coordinated approach to 
22
prevention, intervention, treatment, enforcement, 
23
and research is key to making progress. This section 
24
recognizes the need for a focused national effort, 
25
and addresses particulars of the Federal portion of

that effort, as well as Federal support for State ac-
1
tivities. 
2
‘‘(2) The Secretary shall continue to conduct 
3
research and collect data on the short- and long- 
4
range impact of alcohol use and abuse upon adoles-
5
cent brain development and other organ systems. 
6
‘‘(3) States and communities, including colleges 
7
and universities, are encouraged to adopt com-
8
prehensive prevention approaches, including— 
9
‘‘(A) evidence-based screening, programs, 
10
and curricula; 
11
‘‘(B) brief intervention strategies; 
12
‘‘(C) consistent policy enforcement; and 
13
‘‘(D) science-based strategies to reduce un-
14
derage drinking. 
15
‘‘(4) Public health groups, consumer groups, 
16
and the alcohol beverage industry should continue 
17
and expand evidence-based efforts to prevent and re-
18
duce underage drinking. 
19
‘‘(5) The entertainment industries and social 
20
media platforms have a powerful impact on youth, 
21
and they should use rating systems and marketing 
22
codes to reduce the likelihood that underage audi-
23
ences will be exposed to movies, recordings, tele-

vision programs, or social media with unsuitable al-
1
cohol content. 
2
‘‘(6) The National Collegiate Athletic Associa-
3
tion, its member colleges and universities, and ath-
4
letic conferences should affirm a commitment to a 
5
policy of discouraging alcohol use among underage 
6
students and other young fans. 
7
‘‘(7) Alcohol is a unique product and should be 
8
regulated differently than other products by the 
9
States and Federal Government. States have pri-
10
mary authority to regulate alcohol distribution and 
11
sale, and the Federal Government should support 
12
and supplement these State efforts. States also have 
13
a responsibility to fight youth access to alcohol and 
14
reduce underage drinking. Continued State regula-
15
tion and licensing of the manufacture, importation, 
16
sale, distribution, transportation, and storage of al-
17
coholic beverages are clearly in the public interest 
18
and are critical to promoting responsible consump-
19
tion, preventing illegal access to alcohol by persons 
20
under 21 years of age from commercial and non-
21
commercial sources, maintaining industry integrity 
22
and an orderly marketplace, and furthering effective 
23
State tax collection.

‘‘(8) The age-21 minimum drinking law, en-
1
acted in 1984, has been a remarkably effective pub-
2
lic health and safety policy, as evidenced by the fact 
3
that the percentage of 12th graders who have drunk 
4
alcohol in the past month has fallen by one-half 
5
since the enactment of such law. 
6
‘‘(9) The age-21 law has also has been signifi-
7
cantly effective in reducing drinking and driving 
8
traffic fatalities, as the National Highway Traffic 
9
Safety Administration (NHTSA) estimates that the 
10
age-21 law has saved over 31,000 lives since its in-
11
ception.
