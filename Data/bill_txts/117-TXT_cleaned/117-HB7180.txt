(1) the term ‘‘Director’’ means the Director of 
1
the National Science Foundation; 
2
(2) the term ‘‘National Academies’’ means the 
3
National Academies of Science, Engineering, and 
4
Medicine; and 
5
(3) the term ‘‘eligible entity’’ means an institu-

tion of higher education (as such term is defined in

SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
12
Congress makes the following findings: 
13
(1) The COVID–19 pandemic has disrupted 
14
nearly every aspect of life across the globe. Further-
15
more, it has produced major disruptions of individ-
16
ual’s physical and mental health, including with re-
17
spect of children and adolescents. 
18
(2) Historical epidemiological perspectives sug-
19
gest an association between exposure to general res-
20
piratory viruses and subsequent disruption of reg-
21
ular cognitive processes. 
22
(3) Early research suggests that one in three 
23
individuals diagnosed with a COVID–19 infection 
24

•HR 7180 IH
experiences a disruption of regular cognitive proc-
1
esses within six months of such diagnosis. 
2
(4) Research is urgently needed to better un-
3
derstand why disruption in regular cognitive proc-
4
esses occur in patients as a consequence of a 
5
COVID–19 infection and how long such disruptions 
6
can continue after recovery. 
7
(5) The National Science Foundation has a 
8
deep history of supporting interdisciplinary, basic re-
9
search that spans the social, behavioral, and funda-
10
mental biological sciences and paves the way for sci-
11
entific advancements. 
12
SEC. 4. NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION RESEARCH. 
13
The Director shall award grants to eligible entities, 
14
including through the RAPID funding mechanism, on a 
15
competitive, merit-reviewed basis to support interdiscipli-
16
nary research on the disruption of regular cognitive proc-
17
esses associated with both short-term and long-term 
18
COVID–19 infections, including with respect to children 
19
and adolescents. Such research may include the following: 
20
(1) Foundational studies on the effects of cog-
21
nition, emotion, and neural structure and function 
22
relating to any disruption of regular cognitive proc-
23
esses associated with COVID-19 infection.

•HR 7180 IH
(2) Analysis of findings on the disruption of 
1
regular cognitive processes associated with COVID– 
2
19 infection, including the development of predictive 
3
theoretical frameworks to guide future research. 
4
(3) Development of physical and conceptual 
5
tools needed to evaluate cognition, emotion, and neu-
6
ral structure and function of the brain as a con-
7
sequence of a COVID–19 infection, and the potential 
8
relevance of such infection to the disruption of reg-
9
ular cognitive processes. 
10
(4) Studies on the relevance of psychological 
11
and psychosocial factors, including major disruptions 
12
of physical health, mental health, and economic sta-
13
bility associated with the COVID–19 pandemic, on 
14
the disruption of regular cognitive processes, includ-
15
ing an identification and evaluation of such factors. 
16
(5) Any other activities the Director determines 
17
will support interdisciplinary research and collabora-
18
tion on the disruption of regular cognitive processes 
19
associated with COVID–19 infection, including with 
20
respect to children and adolescents.

the date of the enactment of this Act, the Director 
2
shall enter into an agreement with the National 
3
Academies to study and produce a report on the dis-
4
ruption of cognitive processes associated with

(A) review the research literature and iden-
7
tify research gaps regarding Federal programs

short-term and long-term consequences associ-
10
ated with COVID–19 infection;

(B) assess the necessity of establishing 
12
causal inference approaches into research on 
13
the impacts of COVID-19 infection on cognitive 
14
processes to determine reverse causation; 
15
(C) evaluate and make recommendations 
16
regarding the coordination of research and data
