SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Stop Anti-Abortion 
2
Disinformation Act’’ or the ‘‘SAD Act’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) Abortion services are an essential compo-
6
nent of reproductive healthcare. 
7
(2) The freedom to decide whether and when to 
8
have a child is key to the ability of an individual to 
9
participate fully in our democracy. 
10
(3) Crisis pregnancy centers (CPCs) are anti- 
11
abortion organizations that present themselves as 
12
comprehensive reproductive healthcare providers 
13
with the intent of discouraging pregnant people from 
14
having abortions. 
15
(4) According to the Journal of Medical Inter-
16
net Research (JMIR) Public Health and Surveil-
17
lance, there are more than 2,500 CPCs in the 
18
United States, though some anti-abortion groups 
19
claim that the number is closer to 4,000. 
20
(5) According to 2020 data from JMIR Public 
21
Health and Surveillance, on average, CPCs out-
22
number abortion clinics nationwide by an average of 
23
3 to 1. In some States, this statistic is higher. For 
24
example, The Alliance: State Advocates for Women’s 
25
Rights & Gender Equality (The Alliance) found that 
26

•HR 8210 IH
in Pennsylvania, CPCs outnumber abortion clinics 
1
by 9 to 1. The Alliance also found that in Min-
2
nesota, CPCs outnumber abortion clinics by 11 to 1. 
3
(6) CPCs routinely engage in a variety of de-
4
ceptive tactics, including making false claims about 
5
reproductive health care and providers, dissemi-
6
nating inaccurate, misleading, and stigmatizing in-
7
formation about the risks of abortion and contracep-
8
tion, and using illegitimate or false citations to 
9
imply that deceptive claims are supported by legiti-
10
mate medical sources. 
11
(7) CPCs typically advertise themselves as pro-
12
viders of comprehensive healthcare. However, most 
13
CPCs in the United States do not employ licensed 
14
medical personnel or provide referrals for birth con-
15
trol or abortion care. 
16
(8) By using these deceptive tactics, CPCs pre-
17
vent people from accessing reproductive healthcare 
18
and intentionally delay access to time-sensitive abor-
19
tion services. 
20
(9) CPCs target underresourced neighborhoods 
21
and communities of color, including Black, Latino, 
22
Indigenous, Asian American, Pacific Islander, and 
23
immigrant communities, by locating their facilities 
24
near social services centers and comprehensive re-

productive health care providers. CPCs place adver-
1
tisements in these neighborhoods that mislead and 
2
draw people away from nearby providers that offer 
3
evidence-based sexual and reproductive health care, 
4
including abortion care. This exacerbates existing 
5
health barriers and delays access to time-sensitive 
6
care. 
7
(10) People are entitled to honest, accurate, 
8
and timely information when seeking reproductive 
9
healthcare.
