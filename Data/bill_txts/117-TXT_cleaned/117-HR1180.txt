RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
fatherhood is essential to the development of all children, 
and that the increased involvement of fathers in the 
home will lead to economic prosperity, educational excel-
lence, and improved social mobility for children across 
all racial and ethnic groups. 
Whereas fathers play an important role in providing nurture 
and support for children, enabling them to learn, develop, 
and reach their full potential;

Whereas fatherlessness and the lack of important role models 
in the lives of children today are a root cause of the vio-
lence and unrest we are witnessing in our Nation; 
Whereas despite some successful legislation and the creation 
of fatherhood initiatives, fatherless homes are still preva-
lent; 
Whereas research shows children do best when raised by two 
parents in a committed and long-term marriage; 
Whereas, according to the United States Census Bureau, 
18,400,000 children in the United States live without a 
father in the home; 
Whereas data supports the hypothesis that having strong 
male role models in the home helps prevent suicide, be-
havioral disorders, juvenile detention, substance abuse, 
aggression, violence, and teen pregnancy; 
Whereas fathers play an important role in teaching important 
life skills, providing guidance through challenges, and 
helping children persevere through adversity; and 
Whereas by promoting fatherhood with amended policies that 
incentivize two-parent households and increasing evi-
dence-based practices, the number of fatherless homes 
will decrease across all communities: Now, therefore, be 
it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) affirms the importance of fatherhood in car-

out their lives;
