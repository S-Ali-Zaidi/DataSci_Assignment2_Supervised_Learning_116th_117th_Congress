RESOLUTION 
Urging the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab 
Emirates to honor their partnership with the United States. 
Whereas the United States, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, 
and the United Arab Emirates have traditionally had a 
close partnership based on mutual interests, security co-
operation, the stability of oil markets, information shar-
ing, economic development, and other forms of coopera-
tion; 
Whereas, on October 31, 1950, President Harry Truman 
stated that Saudi Arabia’s ‘‘steadfast loyalty and good 
will, alike in times of stress as in days of happiness and 
well-being, have ever been sources of pride and pleasure 
to me and to the American people’’;

Whereas, on May 24, 1977, President Jimmy Carter said, ‘‘I 
don’t believe there is any other nation with whom we’ve 
had better friendship and a deeper sense of cooperation 
than we’ve found in Saudi Arabia. . .Saudi Arabia is a 
nation which has grown in many ways in the last few 
years in world importance. Their supplies of energy are 
crucial to the well-being of people in many nations. They 
produce their own oil for world consumption beyond the 
level which perhaps would be best for them.’’; 
Whereas, on February 11, 1985, President Ronald Reagan 
said, ‘‘The friendship and cooperation between our gov-
ernments and people are precious jewels whose value we 
should never underestimate. The positive nature of our 
relations demonstrates that cultural differences, as dis-
tinct as our own, need not separate or alienate peoples 
from one another.’’; 
Whereas, on March 10, 2006, President George W. Bush 
stated, ‘‘In order to win the war on terror, we have got 
to strengthen our relationships and friendships with mod-
erate Arab countries in the Middle East. UAE is a com-
mitted ally in the war on terror. They are a key partner 
for our military in a critical region.’’; 
Whereas, on March 9, 2016, then Vice President Joe Biden 
underscored the strong bilateral relationship between the 
United States and the United Arab Emirates, calling the 
bond between the United Arab Emirates and the United 
States ‘‘one of the most significant in the region’’; 
Whereas, on April 21, 2016, President Barack Obama said, 
‘‘The fact of the matter is, is that the friendship and co-
operation that exist between the United States and the 
Gulf countries has been consistent for decades. During 
the course of our administration, the GCC countries have

•HRES 1112 IH 
extensively cooperated with us on counterterrorism, on 
curbing the financing of terrorist activities.’’; 
Whereas the United States came to the aid of Persian Gulf 
allies following Saddam Hussein’s invasion of Kuwait on 
August 2, 1990, including more than 500,000 American 
troops deployed to Saudi Arabia as part of Operation 
Desert Shield, protecting the territorial integrity of the 
Kingdom and further solidifying the relationship between 
the United States and Persian Gulf allies; 
Whereas, like Saddam Hussein’s invasion of Kuwait that 
threatened the security of United States Persian Gulf al-
lies, Russian President Vladimir Putin is executing a war 
of choice by invading Ukraine that threatens to upend 70 
years of international laws and norms; 
Whereas, since 1979, the United States has sold over 
$138,000,000,000 
to 
Saudi 
Arabia 
and 
over 
$26,000,000,000 to the United Arab Emirates in weap-
ons, defense services, and military training to assist both 
countries combat security risks in the region, including 
from terrorism, nonstate actors, and neighboring coun-
tries; 
Whereas, since 2015, the United States has assisted the 
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates 
defend their territorial integrity against Ansar Allah, also 
known as the Houthis, and other threats emanating from 
Yemen, including al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula; 
Whereas, following the September 14, 2019, attack on the 
Abqaiq oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, the United States 
deployed approximately 3,000 troops to Saudi Arabia, in-
cluding fighter squadrons, an air expeditionary wing, and 
other air defense personnel and equipment;

Whereas, in June 2021, President Joe Biden reported to 
Congress that there were approximately 2,700 United 
States military forces in the Kingdom, deployed and ‘‘op-
erating in coordination with the Government of the King-
dom of Saudi Arabia, provide air and missile defense ca-
pabilities and support the operation of United States 
fighter aircraft’’; 
Whereas, on September 11, 2021, Department of Defense 
Spokesman John Kirby said, ‘‘The Defense Department 
continues to maintain tens of thousands of forces and a 
robust force posture in the Middle East representing 
some of our most advanced air power and maritime capa-
bilities, in support of U.S. national interests and our re-
gional partnerships.’’; 
Whereas the State Department licenses contractors that 
maintain and sustain the Saudi Royal Air Force amid 
hostilities in Yemen and its continued bombing campaign 
against Ansar Allah; 
Whereas the United States currently has 2,000 American 
troops at Al-Dhafra Air Base, United Arab Emirates, in-
cluding drones and advanced F–35 fighters, in order to 
assist the United Arab Emirates defend its territory; 
Whereas, on January 24, 2022, and January 31, 2022, 
United States personnel assisted the United Arab Emir-
ates intercept ballistic missiles fired by Ansar Allah in 
Yemen with United States-administered Patriot missile 
defense batteries; 
Whereas there are many factors contributing to the high 
price of oil, including structural market issues that pre-
date Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and uncertainty about 
global demand;

•HRES 1112 IH 
Whereas the agreement between the Organization of the Pe-
troleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), led primarily by 
the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and Russia to maintain a 
steady, limited increase in monthly petroleum production 
is also a major factor in the rising price of gasoline 
worldwide; 
Whereas, despite their close and long-lasting strategic rela-
tionship with the United States, Saudi Arabia and the 
United Arab Emirates have chosen not to increase petro-
leum outputs beyond OPEC-agreed levels amid a major 
increase in global fuel prices; 
Whereas attempts by the White House to engage with United 
States Gulf partners on potentially increasing petroleum 
production have gone unanswered, with reports sug-
gesting that the leaders of Saudi Arabia and United Arab 
Emirates refused calls with President Joe Biden on the 
issue; 
Whereas Article 2.B of OPEC’s founding charter states ‘‘the 
Organization shall devise ways and means of ensuring the 
stabilization of prices in international oil markets with a 
view to eliminating harmful and unnecessary fluctua-
tions’’; 
Whereas, following a decline in demand after the outbreak of 
the COVID–19 pandemic and a request from President 
Donald Trump, Saudi Arabia made drastic changes to 
crude oil production and output in the face of previous 
crises, including finalizing an OPEC deal in April 2020 
that slashed 9,700,000 barrels a day, or close to 10 per-
cent of the world’s output; 
Whereas, while the United States and the world move toward 
expanding the use of clean energy, petroleum production 
00:25 May 13, 2022

•HRES 1112 IH 
should increase in the short term to mitigate rising oil 
prices; 
Whereas Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are un-
derstood by experts to be the only countries with the abil-
ity to increase production that could be felt by consumers 
worldwide; 
Whereas Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have 
approximately a combined additional 1,800,000 to 
3,000,000 barrels a day of spare production capacity; 
and 
Whereas activating their spare production would increase 
supply more rapidly than currently projected and help 
stabilize global crude prices: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives urges

the Persian Gulf partners of the United States, including

the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emir-

ates, to—

(1) honor their lasting friendship with the
