SEC. 2. NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE ESTIMATE ON ESCA-
1
LATION AND DE-ESCALATION OF GRAY ZONE 
2
ACTIVITIES IN GREAT POWER COMPETITION. 
3
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
4
(1) The conventional power of the United 
5
States has driven foreign adversaries to a level of 
6
competition that does not always depend on military 
7
confrontation with the United States. 
8
(2) Rather than challenging the United States 
9
in a manner that could provoke a kinetic military re-
10
sponse, foreign adversaries of the United States have 
11
turned to carrying out gray zone activities to ad-
12
vance the interests of such adversaries, weaken the 
13
power of the United States, and erode the norms 
14
that underpin the United States-led international 
15
order. 
16
(3) Gray zone activity falls on a spectrum of at-
17
tribution and deniability that ranges from covert ad-
18
versary operations, to detectible covert adversary op-
19
erations, to unattributable adversary operations, to 
20
deniable adversary operations, to open adversary op-
21
erations. 
22
(4) To adequately address such a shift to gray 
23
zone activity, the United States must understand 
24
what actions tend to either escalate or de-escalate 
25
such activity by our adversaries. 
26

•HR 6452 IH
(5) The laws, principles, and values of the 
1
United States are strategic advantages in great 
2
power competition with authoritarian foreign adver-
3
saries that carry out gray zone activities, because 
4
such laws, principles, and values increase the appeal 
5
of the governance model of the United States, and 
6
the United States-led international order, to states 
7
and peoples around the world. 
8
(6) The international security environment has 
9
demonstrated numerous examples of gray zone ac-
10
tivities carried out by foreign adversaries, including 
11
the following activities of foreign adversaries: 
12
(A) Information operations, such as efforts 
13
by Russia to influence the 2020 United States 
14
Federal elections (as described in the March 15, 
15
2021, intelligence community assessment of the 
16
Office of the Director of National Intelligence 
17
made publicly available on March 15, 2021). 
18
(B) Adversary political coercion operations, 
19
such as the wielding of energy by Russia, par-
20
ticularly in the context of Ukrainian gas pipe-
21
lines, to coerce its neighbors into compliance 
22
with its policies. 
23

•HR 6452 IH
(C) Cyber operations, such as the use by 
1
China of cyber tools to conduct industrial espio-
2
nage. 
3
(D) Provision of support to proxy forces, 
4
such as the support provided by Iran to 
5
Hezbollah and Shia militia groups. 
6
(E) Provocation by armed forces controlled 
7
by the government of the foreign adversary 
8
through measures that do not rise to the level 
9
of an armed attack, such as the use of the 
10
China Coast Guard and maritime militia by 
11
China to harass the fishing vessels of other 
12
countries in the South China Sea. 
13
(F) Alleged uses of lethal force on foreign 
14
soil, such as the 2018 attempts by Russia to 
15
poison Sergei Skripal in London. 
16
(G) The potential use by an adversary of 
17
technology that causes anomalous health inci-
18
dents among United States Government per-
19
sonnel. 
20
(b) NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE ESTIMATE.— 
21
(1) REQUIREMENT.—The Director of National 
22
Intelligence, acting through the National Intelligence 
23
Council, shall produce a National Intelligence Esti-
24
mate on how foreign adversaries use gray zone ac-
25

•HR 6452 IH
tivities to advance interests, what responses by the 
1
United States (or the allies or partners of the 
2
United States) would tend to result in the escalation 
3
or de-escalation of such gray zone activities by for-
4
eign adversaries, and any opportunities for the 
5
United States to minimize the extent to which for-
6
eign adversaries use gray zone activities in further-
7
ance of great power competition. 
8
(2) MATTERS INCLUDED.—To the extent deter-
9
mined appropriate by the National Intelligence 
10
Council, the National Intelligence Estimate produced 
11
under paragraph (1) may include an assessment of 
12
the following topics: 
13
(A) Any potential or actual lethal or harm-
14
ful gray zone activities carried out against the 
15
United States by foreign adversaries, including 
16
against United States Government employees 
17
and United States persons, whether located 
18
within or outside of the United States. 
19
(B) To the extent such activities have oc-
20
curred, or are predicted to occur— 
21
(i) opportunities to reduce or deter 
22
any such activities; and 
23
(ii) any actions of the United States 
24
Government that would tend to result in 
25

•HR 6452 IH
the escalation or de-escalation of such ac-
1
tivities. 
2
(C) Any incidents in which foreign adver-
3
saries could have used, but ultimately did not 
4
use, gray zone activities to advance the inter-
5
ests of such adversaries, including an assess-
6
ment as to why the foreign adversary ultimately 
7
did not use gray zone activities. 
8
(D) The effect of lowering the United 
9
States Government threshold for the public at-
10
tribution of detectible covert adversary oper-
11
ations, unattributable adversary operations, and 
12
deniable adversary operations. 
13
(E) The effect of lowering the United 
14
States Government threshold for responding to 
15
detectible 
covert 
adversary 
operations, 
16
unattributable adversary operations, and deni-
17
able adversary operations. 
18
(F) The extent to which the governments 
19
of foreign adversaries exercise control over any 
20
proxies or parastate actors used by such gov-
21
ernments in carrying out gray zone activities. 
22
(G) The extent to which gray zone activi-
23
ties carried out by foreign adversaries affect the 
24
private sector of the United States.

(H) The international norms that provide 
1
the greatest deterrence to gray zone activities 
2
carried out by foreign adversaries, and opportu-
3
nities for strengthening those norms. 
4
(I) The effect, if any, of the strengthening 
5
of democratic governance abroad on the resil-
6
ience of United States allies and partners to 
7
gray zone activities.

(J) Opportunities to strengthen the resil-
9
ience of United States allies and partners to 
10
gray zone activities, and associated tactics, car-
11
ried out by foreign adversaries.

(K) Opportunities for the United States to 
13
improve the detection of, and early warning for, 
14
such activities and tactics.

galvanize international support in responding to

such activities and tactics.
