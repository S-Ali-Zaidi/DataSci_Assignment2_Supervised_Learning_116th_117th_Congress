This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Regional Ocean Part-
2

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS; PURPOSES. 
4
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following find-
5
ings: 
6
(1) The ocean and coastal waters of the United 
7
States are foundational to the economy, security, 
8
global competitiveness, and well-being of the United 
9
States and continuously serve the people of the 
10
United States and other countries as an important 
11
source of food, energy, economic productivity, recre-
12
ation, culture, beauty, and enjoyment. 
13
(2) Over many years, the resource productivity 
14
and water quality of the ocean and coastal areas of 
15
the United States have been diminished by pollution, 
16
increasing population demands, economic develop-
17
ment, and natural and man-made hazard events, 
18
both acute and chronic. 
19
(3) Ocean and coastal areas of the United 
20
States are managed by State and Federal resource 
21
agencies and regulated on an interstate and regional 
22
scale by various overlapping Federal authorities, 
23
thereby creating a significant need for interstate co-
24
ordination to enhance regional priorities, including 
25
the ecological and economic health of those areas.

(4) Tribes and Indigenous communities have 
1
unique expertise and knowledge important for the 
2
stewardship of our ocean and coastal waters. 
3
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
4
gress that— 
5
(1) the United States should seek to support 
6
interstate coordination of shared regional priorities 
7
relating to the management, conservation, resilience, 
8
and restoration of ocean and coastal areas to maxi-
9
mize efficiencies through collaborative regional ef-
10
forts by regional ocean partnerships, in consultation 
11
with Federal and State agencies, Tribal govern-
12
ments, and local authorities; 
13
(2) such efforts would enhance existing and ef-
14
fective State coastal management efforts based on 
15
shared regional priorities; and 
16
(3) regional ocean partnerships should either 
17
directly include representation from Tribal govern-
18
ments or have dedicated consultation with such gov-
19
ernments. 
20
(c) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this subtitle are as 
21
follows: 
22
(1) To complement and expand cooperative vol-
23
untary efforts intended to manage and restore ocean

1
boundaries. 
2
(2) To expand Federal support for monitoring, 
3
data management, and restoration activities in ocean 
4
and coastal areas. 
5
(3) To commit the United States to a com-
6
prehensive cooperative program to achieve improved 
7
water quality in, and improvements in the produc-
8
tivity of living resources of, all coastal ecosystems. 
9
(4) To authorize regional ocean partnerships as 
10
intergovernmental coordinators for shared interstate 
11
and regional priorities relating to the collaborative 
12
management of the large marine ecosystems, thereby 
13
reducing duplication of efforts and maximizing op-
14
portunities to leverage support in the ocean and 
15
coastal regions. 
16
(5) To empower States and Tribes to take a 
17
lead role in managing oceans and coasts. 
18
(6) To incorporate Tribal interests in the man-
19
agement of our oceans and coasts and provide fund-
20
ing to support Tribal and Indigenous ocean and 
21
coastal resiliency activities in coordination with re-
22
gional ocean partnerships.
