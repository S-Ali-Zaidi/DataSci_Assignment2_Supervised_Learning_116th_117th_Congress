A BILL

ment authorities of cases in which the national instant 
criminal background check system indicates that a fire-
arm has been sought to be acquired by a prohibited 
person, so that authorities may pursue criminal charges 
under State law, and to ensure that the Department 
of Justice reports to Congress on prosecutions secured 
against prohibited persons who attempt to acquire a fire-
arm.
