To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to protect 
children’s health by denying any deduction for adver-
tising and marketing directed at children to promote 
the consumption of food of poor nutritional quality. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Stop Subsidizing 
4
Childhood Obesity Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 9299 IH
(1) Childhood obesity has more than doubled in 
1
children and tripled in adolescents in the past 30 
2
years. Currently, more than one-third of children 
3
and adolescents are overweight or obese. 
4
(2) A report by the Robert Wood Johnson 
5
Foundation found that if the population of the 
6
United States continues on its current trajectory, 
7
adult obesity rates could exceed 60 percent in a 
8
number of States by 2030. 
9
(3) Health-related behaviors, such as eating 
10
habits and physical activity patterns, develop early 
11
in life and often extend into adulthood. The diets of 
12
American children and adolescents depart substan-
13
tially from recommended patterns that put their 
14
health at risk. Overall, American children and youth 
15
are not achieving basic nutritional goals. They are 
16
consuming excess calories and added sugars and 
17
have higher than recommended intakes of sodium, 
18
total fat, and saturated fats. 
19
(4) According to a 2012 report from the Fed-
20
eral Trade Commission, the total amount spent on 
21
food marketing to children is about $2,000,000,000 
22
a year. 
23
(5) Companies market food to children through 
24
television, radio, internet, magazines, product place-

ment in movies and video games, schools, product 
1
packages, toys, clothing and other merchandise, and 
2
almost anywhere a logo or product image can be 
3
shown. 
4
(6) According to a comprehensive review by the 
5
National Academy of Medicine, studies demonstrate 
6
that television food advertising affects children’s 
7
food choices, food purchase requests, diets, and 
8
health. 
9
(7) A 2005 report from the National Academy 
10
of Medicine confirmed that marketing of high-calorie 
11
foods to children and adolescents has been identified 
12
as one of the major contributors to childhood obe-
13
sity. 
14
(8) Nearly three-quarters of the foods adver-
15
tised on television shows intended for children are 
16
for sweets and convenience or fast foods.
