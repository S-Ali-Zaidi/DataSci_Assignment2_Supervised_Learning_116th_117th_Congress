RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
United States policy should encourage Russian Govern-
ment officials, including diplomats, to abandon Putin’s 
war with Ukraine, and that Russian officials who defect 
should be granted expedited admission to the United 
States as refugees if they clear all applicable vetting 
and security procedures. 
Whereas, on February 24, 2022, the Russia military began 
a shameless full-scale invasion of Ukraine, including car-
rying attacks on cities with ballistic missiles, artillery, 
and tanks; 
Whereas some government officials are forced to support 
Putin’s war;
