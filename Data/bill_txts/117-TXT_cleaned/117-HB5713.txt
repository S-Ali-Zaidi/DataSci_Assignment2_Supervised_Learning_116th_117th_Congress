A BILL 
To empower independent music creator owners to collectively 
negotiate with dominant online platforms regarding the 
terms on which their music may be distributed. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Protect Working Musi-
4
cians Act of 2021’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Music is a cultural treasure and a unique 
8
source of spiritual inspiration, emotional comfort,

community connection, and joy. It is also a powerful 
1
economic driver that directly and indirectly supports 
2
nearly 2 million American jobs and almost $150 bil-
3
lion in annual economic activity. 
4
(2) A healthy music ecosystem is a fundamental 
5
bedrock for a healthy society. 
6
(3) Fair and competitive markets for the use 
7
and licensing of recorded music are integral to a 
8
healthy music ecosystem. 
9
(4) As music distribution has moved online, the 
10
market for use and licensing has become distorted 
11
and imbalanced. The largest Dominant Online Music 
12
Distribution Platforms use their market power to 
13
distort legal requirements and force music creators 
14
into licensing agreements that do not reflect market 
15
value. Those agreements essentially dictate a price 
16
to music creators. If music creators do not agree to 
17
licensing terms, the online platforms profit from un-
18
licensed uploads of music anyway. 
19
(5) These platforms game the system created 
20
by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which al-
21
lows dominant online platforms to ignore and profit 
22
from unlicensed use of music and places the respon-
23
sibility for finding each and every instance of unli-
24
censed use of music on music creators. This ‘‘notice

and takedown’’ scheme has been described as a gig-
1
abit-speed game of whack-a-mole. 
2
(6) The trade association for the major record 
3
labels spends millions of dollars engaged in this ef-
4
fort which it says has grown to be ‘‘largely useless.’’ 
5
The trade association for the independent record la-
6
bels agrees, calling it a ‘‘dysfunctional relic’’. 
7
(7) An effort that is largely useless for major 
8
and independent record labels is an exercise in futil-
9
ity for Independent Music Creator Owners—those 
10
who own the copyrights and market their work 
11
themselves. Independent Music Creator Owners lack 
12
the economic, legal, and political resources to stand 
13
up to the Dominant Online Music Distribution Plat-
14
forms and have no way to meaningfully negotiate 
15
fair licensing rates for their work. 
16
(8) That power imbalance means that Inde-
17
pendent Music Creator Owners are forced to take 
18
whatever terms dominant online platforms offer for 
19
their work. If they decline, the platforms simply ig-
20
nore them since in most cases lacking access to any 
21
single artists’ work does not present a threat to the 
22
platforms’ overall attractiveness to consumers. 
23
(9) This imbalance has decimated careers in 
24
music at an untold cost to our society and culture.

(10) The antitrust laws were intended to and

do provide important economic and civic benefits.

(12) While antitrust exemptions are generally 
10
disfavored, should the application of the antitrust

laws ever be applied in a manner that conflicts with 
12
their purpose—such as protecting the online market-
