Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Combating Wildlife

Trafficking Financing and Proceeds Study Act’’.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 6477 IH
(1) The 2017 report by the think tank, Global 
1
Financial Integrity, entitled ‘‘Transnational Crime 
2
and the Developing World’’, determined that the an-
3
nual global retail value of illegal wildlife trade is be-
4
tween $5 billion to $23 billion, and when losses to 
5
ecosystem services are considered, the World Bank 
6
estimates the cost of environmental crime is between 
7
$1 trillion and $2 trillion, annually. 
8
(2) Wildlife traffickers do not prefer particular 
9
species or commodities, but instead, according to the 
10
non-governmental organization, United for Wildlife, 
11
wildlife traffickers focus on the demand, availability, 
12
profit potential, and relatively low risk associated 
13
with acquiring, trading, and distributing wildlife 
14
globally. 
15
(3) The trafficking of wildlife affects human 
16
health because of undetected spread of zoonotic dis-
17
eases, scarcity in food resources, and the environ-
18
mental results of degraded ecosystems. 
19
(4) Also, the trafficking of illicit wildlife such as 
20
pangolins from Africa, macaws from Peru, turtles 
21
from the United States, and rosewood species smug-
22
gled globally threatens our national security at home 
23
and American interests abroad because rogue orga-
24
nizations, including transnational criminal organiza-

tions, use the proceeds to fund illegal and violent 
1
acts throughout the world, fueling corruption and 
2
benefiting from corrupt government officials, weak-
3
ening the rule of law, and distorting commercial 
4
markets. 
5
(5) Many of these supply chains are affected by 
6
Chinese activity, from the criminal organizations in-
7
volved in the initial poaching of targeted commod-
8
ities to the demand for goods produced from endan-
9
gered plants and animals. 
10
(6) The Organized Crime Drug Enforcement 
11
Task Forces conducted an investigation known as 
12
‘‘Operation Apex’’ which identified extensive overlaps 
13
among drug trafficking organizations, professional 
14
money launderers, and wildlife trafficking syn-
15
dicates. 
16
(7) A study conducted by Federal entities that 
17
examined wildlife trafficking networks determined 
18
that— 
19
(A) more than two-thirds of persons traf-
20
ficking wildlife also trafficked narcotics; 
21
(B) 10 percent of persons trafficking wild-
22
life were doing so to finance terrorism; and 
23

•HR 6477 IH
(C) a small percentage of persons traf-
1
ficking wildlife were doing so to finance the pro-
2
liferation of nuclear materials. 
3
(8) Because wildlife trafficking is executed as 
4
part of a commodity-agnostic global enterprise, the 
5
United States and allies of the United States should 
6
focus efforts to reduce wildlife trafficking on cur-
7
tailing the expansive networks that traffic wildlife 
8
and other goods and on bringing enforcement ac-
9
tions against persons who launder the proceeds of 
10
those persons who traffic wildlife rather than pursue 
11
specific nations, groups, or commodities. 
12
(9) In the past decade, the illicit wildlife trade 
13
has moved online, mainly to social media platforms, 
14
creating jurisdictional and technical challenges for 
15
law enforcement.
