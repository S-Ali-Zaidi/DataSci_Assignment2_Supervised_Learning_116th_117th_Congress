RESOLUTION 
Remembering the 80th anniversary of the Solomon Islands 
campaign, including the battles of Guadalcanal and 
Ironbottom Sound. 
Whereas, following Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor on De-
cember 7, 1941, and the United States entry into World 
War II, Japan commenced its occupation of the Western 
Pacific, expanding its forward base of operations, dis-
rupting key trade and supply routes, and threatening key 
Allies like Australia; 
Whereas one of the most strategic positions in the Western 
Pacific was the Solomon Islands and its main island of

Guadalcanal, which Japan occupied together with its sur-
rounding seas; 
Whereas, on the morning of August 7, 1942, the United 
States Marines and Navy and Allies mounted the first 
major amphibious landing of World War II at Guadal-
canal; 
Whereas after fierce fighting on the Solomon Islands of Gua-
dalcanal, Tulagi, and Florida, the Marines occupied Gua-
dalcanal on August 9 and renamed the captured Japa-
nese runway Henderson Field; 
Whereas immediately following occupation of Guadalcanal, 
the first of many deadly naval battles occurred at the in-
famous Ironbottom Sound off the coast of the island; 
Whereas the fight for control of Guadalcanal, its critical air-
field, and the seas around them continued for months, 
with both sides losing men, ships, and aircraft while also 
fighting tropical diseases in a threatening environment; 
Whereas among many legendary efforts, the celebrated Cac-
tus Air Force, operating from Henderson Field and com-
prised of aviators from the Navy, Marine Corps, Army, 
and Allies, sank or destroyed large enemy vessels and 
shot down hundreds of enemy aircraft, which thwarted 
the enemy’s attempts to retake the island; 
Whereas, in February 1943, after 6 months of fierce and in-
tense battles, the Japanese withdrew their final forces 
and left the island and surrounding seas under United 
States control; 
Whereas securing Guadalcanal, Henderson Field, and the 
surrounding islands and seas became a critical turning 
point in the war and a critical Allied base for the subse-

quent island-hopping campaign toward mainland Japan 
that brought an end to Japanese imperialism; 
Whereas the Solomon Islands campaign cost the United 
States and its Allies 
the 
lives 
of 
some 
7,000 
servicemembers, with an additional 7,000 servicemembers 
wounded, 29 ships sunk in and around Ironbottom 
Sound, and over 600 aircraft shot down; 
Whereas, as a direct result of the sacrifice of thousands of 
Allied lives at and around Guadalcanal, both the Solomon 
Islands and Japan and the broader Indo-Pacific have 
lived and prospered under 3 generations of democracy; 
and 
Whereas it is appropriate that the United States remember 
those lives lost and harmed 80 years ago, and rededicate 
the United States to a democratic Indo-Pacific: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
