•HR 115 IH
(1) As a Member of Congress from the Tenth 
1
Congressional District of Texas, as majority leader 
2
of the U.S. Senate, Vice President and President of 
3
the United States, Lyndon Baines Johnson’s accom-
4
plishments in the fields of civil rights, education, 
5
and economic opportunity rank among the greatest 
6
achievements of the past half century. 
7
(2) As President, Lyndon Johnson proposed, 
8
championed, led to passage, and signed into law on 
9
August 6, 1965, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 
10
which swept away barriers impeding millions of 
11
Americans from meaningful participation in Amer-
12
ican political life. 
13
(3) On July 30, 1965, President Johnson 
14
signed into law the Social Security Amendments Act 
15
of 1965, popularly known as Medicare, which has 
16
transformed the delivery of health care in the United 
17
States and which, along with Social Security, re-
18
duced the rate of poverty among the elderly from 
19
28.5 percent in 1966 to 9.1 percent in 2012. 
20
(4) On July 2, 1964, President Johnson se-
21
cured passage and signed into law the most sweep-
22
ing civil rights legislation since Reconstruction, the

modations based on race, color, religion, or national 
1
origin.

(5) On November 8, 1965, President Johnson 
3
signed into law the Higher Education Act, which 
4
provided need-based financial aid to students in the 
5
form of scholarships, work-study grants, and loans, 
6
and thus made higher education more accessible to 
7
populations of persons who were previously unable to 
8
attend college because of economic circumstances.

(6) On October 3, 1965, President Johnson 
10
signed into law the Immigration and Naturalization 
11
Act of 1965, which transformed the Nation’s immi-
12
gration system by abolishing the racially based quota 
13
system that had defined American immigration pol-
14
icy for four decades and replaced it with a policy 
15
whose central purpose was family reunification, with 
16
a preference for immigrants with specific skill sets. 
17
(7) According to Robert A. Caro, the pre-
18
eminent biographer of Lyndon Baines Johnson, with 
19
the single exception of Lincoln, President Johnson 
20
was the greatest champion of the poor and under-
21
privileged in the history of the Republic and was the 
22
President ‘‘who wrote mercy and justice into the 
23
statute books by which America was governed’’.
