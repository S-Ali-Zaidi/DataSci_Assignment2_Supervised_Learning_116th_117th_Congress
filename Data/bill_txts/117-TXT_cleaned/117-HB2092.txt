that enters correctional facilities, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Contraband Elimi-
4
nation and Safety Act of 2021’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6

7
(1) Mail service is one of the oldest and most 
8
commonly used methods to introduce contraband

into correction facilities, creating an expensive and 
1
often lethal problem for both inmates and employees 
2
of the Federal prison facility. 
3
(2) Processing mail in-house puts staff mem-
4
bers in danger of substance exposure and increases 
5
risk of contraband items entering the facility. 
6
(3) Studies have consistently found that pris-
7
oners who maintain close contact with their family 
8
members while incarcerated have better post-release 
9
outcomes and lower recidivism rates. 
10
(4) Effective offsite mail processing ensures 
11
that prisoners’ right to receive mail is protected and 
12
gives prison officials a safe, defensible alternative to 
13
mail restrictions that are unreasonable and arbi-
14
trary.
