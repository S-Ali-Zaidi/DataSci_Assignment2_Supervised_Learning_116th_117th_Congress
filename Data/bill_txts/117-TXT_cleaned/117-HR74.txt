be bestowed upon an individual serving in the United 
States Armed Forces; 
Whereas, since its first presentation in 1863, 3,515 members 
of the Armed Forces have received the Congressional 
Medal of Honor with just less than half being awarded

have played vital roles in military operations throughout 
the history of the United States; 
Whereas 88 African Americans have been awarded the Con-
gressional Medal of Honor for military valor; 
Whereas Sergeant William Harvey Carney, a member of 
Company C of the 54th Massachusetts Colored Infantry, 
was the first African American to earn the Congressional 
Medal of Honor when, during the attack on Fort Wagner 
on July 18, 1863, he risked his own life above and be-
yond the call of duty to save the American flag while 
under heavy fire and prevent its capture, despite being 
wounded several times by Confederate fire; 
Whereas William Harvey Carney was not presented with the 
Congressional Medal of Honor until nearly 37 years after 
his acts of bravery;

the criteria for awarding medals during World War II; 
Whereas after an exhaustive review, the study recommended

in the Armed Forces play a critical role in the defense 
and security of the United States: Now, therefore, be it
