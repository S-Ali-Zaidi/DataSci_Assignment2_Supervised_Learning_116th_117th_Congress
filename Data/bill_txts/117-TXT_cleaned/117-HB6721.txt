(1) In 1960, Corona established the Corona 
1
Municipal Airport to provide recreational opportuni-
2
ties for aviators throughout southern California. 
3
(2) The City of Corona initially entered into a 
4
lease agreement with the U.S. Army Corps of Engi-
5
neers on December 24, 1959. 
6
(3) The City’s lease with the Corps of Engi-
7
neers enabled the construction of the airport into its 
8
current configuration. 
9
(4) For over 60 years, the Corona Municipal 
10
Airport has supported local businesses, tourism, and 
11
recreation for local residents and the region. 
12
(5) The Corona Municipal Airport maintains 
13
the capability to assist in public safety efforts to 
14
protect life and property where aviation assets may 
15
be necessary. 
16
(6) The Corona Municipal Airport supports ap-
17
proximately one dozen local, small businesses. 
18
(7) The Corona Municipal Airport continues to 
19
drive business development and local tourism for the 
20
City of Corona and connect people throughout 
21
southern California to those opportunities.

without an opportunity to grandfather the facility 
1
under existing policies. 
2
(9) The closure of the Corona Municipal Air-
3
port would deprive aviators of significant opportuni-
4
ties to enjoy this recreation pastime as fewer small, 
5
recreational airports in the region remain open and 
6
accessible. 
7
(10) Extending the City’s lease with the Corps 
8
of Engineers would allow this culturally and eco-
9
nomically significant facility to continue serving avi-
10
ators in the region.
