SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
3
Congress finds the following: 
4
(1) Transfers to and from Iran of arms or re-
5
lated materiel or military equipment represent a con-
6
tinuing threat to regional and international security, 
7
as evidenced by Iran’s continued military support 
8
that fuels ongoing conflict in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, 
9
and Yemen. 
10
(2) Iran benefits from engaging in the conven-
11
tional arms trade by strengthening its relationships 
12
with other outlier regimes, lessening its international 
13
isolation, and deriving revenue that it uses to sup-
14
port terror groups and fund malign activities. 
15
(3) Chinese and Russian arms transfers to Iran 
16
are a threat to the national security of the United 
17
States and to its allies and partners in the region, 
18
including Israel, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab 
19
Emirates, and others. 
20
(4) The arms embargo imposed on Iran by the 
21
United Nations Security Council found in United 
22
National Security Council Resolutions 1747 and 
23
1929 was terminated by the Joint Comprehensive 
24
Plan of Action (JCPOA), otherwise known as the

Iran nuclear deal, which ended the long-standing 
1
prohibition on arms transfers to and from Iran in 
2
October 2020 as part of UN Security Council Reso-
3
lution 2231. 
4
(5) In response to the expiration of the United 
5
Nations arms embargo, the United States imposed 
6
sanctions on international arms transfers to and 
7
from Iran in Executive Order 13949 (85 Fed. Reg. 
8
