tation shall enter into an agreement with the Transpor-
1
tation Research Board of the National Academies to con-
2
duct a study of the actions needed to ensure that Federal 
3
agencies are taking into account current and future cli-
4
mate conditions in planning, designing, building, oper-
5
ating, maintaining, investing in, and upgrading any feder-
6
ally funded transportation infrastructure investments. 
7
(b) METHODOLOGIES.—In conducting the study, the 
8
Transportation Research Board shall build on the meth-
9
odologies examined and recommended in— 
10
(1) the 2018 report issued the American Soci-
11
ety of Civil Engineers, titled ‘‘Climate-Resilient In-
12
frastructure: Adaptive Design and Risk Manage-
13
ment’’; and 
14
(2) the report issued by the California Climate- 
15
Safe Infrastructure Working Group, titled ‘‘Paying 
16
it Forward: The Path Toward Climate-Safe Infra-
17
structure in California’’. 
18
(c) CONTENTS OF STUDY.—The study shall include 
19
specific recommendations regarding the following: 
20
(1) Integrating scientific knowledge of projected 
21
climate change impacts, and other relevant data and 
22
information, into Federal infrastructure planning, 
23
design, engineering, construction, operation and 
24
maintenance.

(2) Addressing critical information gaps and 
1
challenges. 
2
(3) Financing options to help fund climate-resil-
3
ient infrastructure. 
4
(4) A platform or process to facilitate commu-
5
nication between climate scientists and other experts 
6
with infrastructure planners, engineers and other 
7
relevant experts. 
8
(5) A stakeholder process to engage with rep-
9
resentatives of State, local, tribal and community 
10
groups. 
11
(6) A platform for tracking Federal funding of 
12
climate-resilient infrastructure. 
13
(7) Labor and workforce needs to implement 
14
climate-resilient 
transportation 
infrastructure 
15
projects including new and emerging skills, training 
16
programs, competencies and recognized postsec-
17
ondary credentials that may be required to ade-
18
quately equip the workforce. 
19
(8) Outlining how Federal infrastructure plan-
20
ning, design, engineering, construction, operation, 
21
and maintenance impact the environment and public 
22
health of disproportionately exposed communities. 
23
For purposes of this paragraph, the term ‘‘dis-
24
proportionately exposed communities’’ means a com-

munity in which climate change, pollution, or envi-
1
ronmental destruction have exacerbated systemic ra-
2
cial, regional, social, environmental, and economic 
3
injustices by disproportionately affecting indigenous 
4
peoples, communities of color, migrant communities, 
5
deindustrialized communities, depopulated rural 
6
communities, the poor, low-income workers, women, 
7
the elderly, people experiencing homelessness, people 
8
with disabilities, people who are incarcerated, or

youth. 
10
(d) CONSIDERATIONS.—In carrying out the study, 
11
the Transportation Research Board shall determine the 
12
need for information related to climate resilient transpor-
13
tation infrastructure by considering— 
14
(1) the current informational and institutional 
15
barriers to integrating projected infrastructure risks 
16
posed by climate change into federal infrastructure 
17
planning, design, engineering, construction, oper-
18
ation and maintenance; 
19
(2) the critical information needed by engineers, 
20
planners and those charged with infrastructure up-
21
grades and maintenance to better incorporate cli-
22
mate change risks and impacts over the lifetime of 
23
projects;

(3) how to select an appropriate, adaptive engi-
1
neering design for a range of future climate sce-
2
narios as related to infrastructure planning and in-
3
vestment; 
4
(4) how to incentivize and incorporate systems 
5
thinking into engineering design to maximize the 
6
benefits of multiple natural functions and emissions 
7
reduction, as well as regional planning; 
8
(5) how to take account of the risks of cas-
9
cading infrastructure failures and develop more ho-
10
listic approaches to evaluating and mitigating cli-
11
mate risks; 
12
(6) how to ensure that investments in infra-
13
structure resilience benefit all communities, includ-
14
ing communities of color, low-income communities 
15
and tribal communities that face a disproportionate 
16
risk from climate change and in many cases have ex-
17
perienced long-standing unmet needs and under-
18
investment in critical infrastructure; 
19
(7) how to incorporate capital assessment and 
20
planning training and techniques, including a range 
21
of financing options to help local and State govern-
22
ments plan for and provide matching funds; 
23
(8) how federal agencies can track and monitor 
24
federally funded resilient infrastructure in a coordi-

nated fashion to help build the understanding of the 
1
cost-benefit of resilient infrastructure and to build 
2
the capacity for implementing resilient infrastruc-
3
ture; and 
4
(9) the occupations, skillsets, training pro-
5
grams, competencies and recognized postsecondary 
6
credentials that will be needed to implement such 
7
climate-resilient 
transportation 
infrastructure 
8
projects, and how to ensure that any new jobs cre-
9
ated by such projects ensure that priority hiring con-
10
siderations are given to individuals facing barriers to 
11
employment, communities of color, low-income com-
12
munities and tribal communities that face a dis-
13
proportionate risk from climate change and have 
14
been excluded from job opportunities.
