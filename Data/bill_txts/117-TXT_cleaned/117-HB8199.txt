A BILL 
To ban certain small, high-powered magnets, and for other 
purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Magnet Injury Preven-
4
tion Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress makes the following findings: 
7
(1) Small, high-powered magnets are commonly 
8
sold in sets of 200 or more individual magnets. 
9
(2) Small, high-powered magnets pose a hidden 
10
hazard to infants, children, and teens.

(3) When 2 or more high-powered magnets are 
1
ingested, or a high-powered magnet and a ferromag-
2
netic object are ingested, the force (or flux) allows 
3
magnets to find each other across or between dif-
4
ferent segments of body tissue, such as GI tissue. 
5
(4) When magnets, or magnets and ferromag-
6
netic objects, connect across or between different 
7
segments of body tissue, the result can be perfora-
8
tions, abscesses, fistulas, or other life-threatening 
9
conditions. 
10
(5) Sometimes, the magnetic force causes the 
11
body tissue, such as intestines, to twist, cutting off 
12
blood supply and leading to bowel necrosis. 
13
(6) Ingestion of 2 or more high-powered 
14
magnets, or a high-powered magnet and a ferromag-
15
netic object, confers a high risk of abdominal catas-
16
trophe and death. 
17
(7) Ingestion of 2 or more high-powered 
18
magnets has resulted in numerous deaths and seri-
19
ous injuries. 
20
(8) Children almost universally require high- 
21
cost medical intervention following high-powered 
22
magnet ingestions. 
23
(9) Evidence does not exist that warning infor-
24
mation, alone, will sufficiently reduce the hazard as-

sociated with the ingestion of small, high-powered 
1
magnets. 
2
(10) The absence of final regulatory action to 
3
reinstate standards for small, high-powered magnet 
4
sets requires legislative action.

SEC. 3. BAN ON CERTAIN MAGNETS. 
6
(a) BAN
ON
CERTAIN
SMALL, HIGH-POWERED 
7
MAGNETS.—Not later than 90 days after the date of en-
8
actment of this Act, covered small, high-powered magnets, 
9
regardless of the date of manufacture, shall be considered 
10
a banned hazardous product under section 8 of the Con-
11
sumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2057). 
12
(b) COVERED SMALL, HIGH-POWERED MAGNET DE-
13
FINED.—In this section, the term ‘‘covered small, high- 
14
powered magnet’’ means any individual or set of separable 
15
magnets that— 
16
(1) is— 
17
(A) a consumer product (as defined in sec-
18
tion 3 of the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 
19
U.S.C. 2052)) that is— 
20
(i) designed, marketed, or intended to 
21
be used for entertainment, jewelry (includ-
22
ing children’s jewelry), mental stimulation, 
23
stress relief, or a combination of these;

2
(iii) not children’s jewelry that is sub-
3
ject to ASTM F2923 (or any successor 
4
standard); or 
5
(B) a component of a consumer product 
6
described in subparagraph (A); 
7
(2) is or contains any individual magnet that 
8
fits completely within the small parts cylinder de-
9
scribed in section 1501.4 of title 16, Code of Federal 
10
Regulations; and 
11
(3) is or contains any individual magnet with a 
12
flux index of 50 kG2 mm2 or greater.

SEC. 4. CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY STANDARD FOR 
14
OTHER SMALL, HIGH-POWERED MAGNETS. 
15
(a) FINAL STANDARD FOR OTHER SMALL, HIGH- 
16
17
the date of enactment of this Act, the Consumer Product 
18
Safety Commission shall promulgate, in accordance with 
19
section 553 of title 5, United States Code, a final con-
20
sumer product safety standard for other small, high-pow-
21
ered magnets if the Commission determines that a con-
22
sumer product safety standard is reasonably necessary to 
23
protect children from death or injury related to such 
24
magnets. The determination made by the Commission 
25

(c) OTHER SMALL, HIGH-POWERED MAGNETS DE-
10
FINED.—In this section, the term ‘‘other small, high-pow-
11
ered magnets’’ means any individual or set of separable
