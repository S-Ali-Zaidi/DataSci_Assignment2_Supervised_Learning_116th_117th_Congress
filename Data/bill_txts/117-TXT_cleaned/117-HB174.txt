pendents and to qualifying students, and for other pur-
poses. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 174 IH
(1) The Federal earned income tax credit is a 
1
refundable tax credit for lower- and middle-income 
2
working individuals and families whose earnings are 
3
below an income threshold. 
4
(2) Since its establishment in 1975, the credit 
5
has increased family income, reduced child poverty, 
6
and promoted employment by supplementing the 
7
earnings of low-wage workers, including military 
8
families. 
9
(3) The credit has a positive impact on the edu-
10
cation and health of children living in poverty. 
11
(4) The credit has a positive economic impact 
12
on local economies and businesses because it puts 
13
more money in the hands of low- and middle-income 
14
working people who spend the money on immediate 
15
needs, such as groceries, school supplies, car repairs, 
16
rent, and health care. 
17
(5) The widening gap between the incomes of 
18
the wealthiest Americans and those of middle- and 
19
lower-income Americans is alarming. 
20
(6) There is an urgent need to address that 
21
gap, including through measures like this legislation 
22
and by raising the Federal minimum wage which to-
23
gether increase the wages of working Americans,
