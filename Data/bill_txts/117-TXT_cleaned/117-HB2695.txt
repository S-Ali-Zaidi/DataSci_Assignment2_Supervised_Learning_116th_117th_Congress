Congress makes the following findings:

(1) According to the report issued by the Na-
5
tional Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Med-
6
icine in 2018 entitled ‘‘Sexual Harassment of 
7
Women: Climate, Culture, and Consequences in Aca-
8
demic Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine’’— 
9
(A) sexual harassment is pervasive in insti-
10
tutions of higher education; 
11
(B) the most common type of sexual har-
12
assment is gender harassment, which includes 
13
verbal and nonverbal behaviors that convey in-
14
sulting, hostile, and degrading attitudes about 
15
members of one gender; 
16
(C) 58 percent of individuals in the aca-
17
demic workplace experience sexual harassment, 
18
the second highest rate when compared to the 
19
military, the private sector, and Federal, State, 
20
and local government;

•HR 2695 IH
(D) women who are members of racial or 
1
ethnic minority groups are more likely to expe-
2
rience sexual harassment and to feel unsafe at 
3
work than White women, White men, or men 
4
who are members of such groups; 
5
(E) the training for each individual who 
6
has a doctor of philosophy in the science, tech-
7
nology, engineering, and mathematics fields is 
8
estimated to cost approximately $500,000; and 
9
(F) attrition of an individual so trained re-
10
sults in a loss of talent and money. 
11
(2) Sexual harassment undermines career ad-
12
vancement for women. 
13
(3) According to a 2017 University of Illinois 
14
study, among astronomers and planetary scientists, 
15
18 percent of women who are members of racial or 
16
ethnic minority groups and 12 percent of White 
17
women skipped professional events because they did 
18
not feel safe attending. 
19
(4) Many women report leaving employment at 
20
institutions of higher education due to sexual har-
21
assment. 
22
(5) Research shows the majority of individuals 
23
do not formally report experiences of sexual harass-
24
23:09 May 14, 2021

•HR 2695 IH
ment due to a justified fear of retaliation or other 
1
negative professional or personal consequences. 
2
(6) Reporting procedures with respect to such 
3
harassment are inconsistent among Federal science 
4
agencies and have varying degrees of accessibility. 
5
(7) There is not adequate communication 
6
among Federal science agencies and between such 
7
agencies and grantees regarding reports of sexual 
8
harassment, which has resulted in harassers receiv-
9
ing Federal funding after moving to a different in-
10
stitution.
