SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress makes the following findings: 
2
(1) The United States values its longstanding 
3
alliance with the Republic of Turkey and its friend-
4
ship with the people of Turkey, and seeks to pro-
5
mote their democratic aspirations. 
6
(2) Actions taken by the Government of Turkey 
7
in the aftermath of the attempted coup of July 2016 
8
have significantly expanded the government’s crack-
9
down on freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly, 
10
and association. Freedom House assessed Turkey to 
11
be ‘‘not free’’ in its Freedom in the World 2021 re-
12
port. 
13
(3) Since July 2016, Turkish authorities have 
14
detained tens of thousands of people they accused of 
15
aiding the coup attempt or supporting terrorism, 
16
sweeping up journalists, opposition politicians, dis-
17
sidents, and others. The end of the state of emer-
18
gency in 2018 has not led to an improvement in fun-
19
damental freedoms in Turkey as the Government of 
20
Turkey has codified some of the provisions from the 
21
state of emergency into law. 
22

•HR 4546 IH
(4) The Government of Turkey has used the at-
1
tempted coup as justification for a broader crack-
2
down. 
3
(5) The 2020 Country Reports on Human 
4
Rights Practices: Turkey states, ‘‘Under broad 
5
antiterror legislation passed in 2018 the government 
6
continued to restrict fundamental freedoms and 
7
compromised the rule of law. Since the 2016 coup 
8
attempt, authorities have dismissed or suspended 
9
more than 60,000 police and military personnel and 
10
approximately 125,000 civil servants, dismissed one- 
11
third of the judiciary, arrested or imprisoned more 
12
than 90,000 citizens, and closed more than 1,500 
13
nongovernmental organizations on terrorism-related 
14
grounds, primarily for alleged ties to the movement 
15
of cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom the government ac-
16
cused of masterminding the coup attempt and des-
17
ignated as the leader of the ‘Fethullah Terrorist Or-
18
ganization.’ ’’. 
19
(6) A 2020 Reuters investigative press report 
20
revealed that the Government of Turkey terminated 
21
4,000 judges and prosecutors since 2016. A 2020 
22
Human Rights Watch report highlighted the contin-
23
ued arbitrary detention of lawyers, which runs con-
24
trary to Turkey’s obligations under the International

(7) Turkey is the world’s second worst jailer of 
8
journalists, according to the Committee to Protect 
9
Journalists. 
10
(8) President Recep Tayyip Erdog˘an began a 
11
crackdown on journalism before the 2016 coup at-
12
tempt, which he then intensified. The Committee to 
13
Protect Journalists estimated that Turkey was hold-
14
ing at least 37 journalists in jail at the end of 2020. 
15
According to a September 18, 2019, joint statement 
16
by civil society organizations, at least 180 media 
17
outlets have been forcibly closed since the coup at-
18
tempt of which Kurdish-language and Kurdish-fo-
19
cused media outlets are especially vulnerable. 
20
(9) The Government of Turkey has also tar-
21
geted writers and academics. Of roughly 2,000 aca-
22
demics who signed a January 2016 petition calling 
23
for a restart to peace negotiations between the gov-
24
ernment and the armed Kurdistan Workers’ Party, 
25

•HR 4546 IH
more than 700 scholars were criminally charged with 
1
making propaganda for a terrorist organization. 
2
(10) The Government of Turkey continues its 
3
unjust, 3-year detention of civil society leader 
4
Osman Kavala. In 2017, Turkish authorities 
5
charged Kavala and 15 others with ‘‘attempting to 
6
overthrow the government or to prevent it from per-
7
forming its duties’’ based on ill-founded accusations 
8
regarding the group’s role in 2013 protests. In De-
9
cember 2019, the European Court of Human Rights 
10
(ECHR) ruled that Kavala’s detention took place in 
11
the absence of sufficient evidence that he had com-
12
mitted an offence, in violation of his right to liberty 
13
and security under the European Convention on 
14
Human Rights. Turkey responded by acquitting 
15
Kavala, but immediately rearresting him under new 
16
charges relating to the 2016 coup attempt and espi-
17
onage and has continued to ignore the binding 
18
ECHR ruling. 
19
(11) In 2017, Turkish police arrested Amnesty 
20
International Turkey’s board chair, Taner Kilic¸, and 
21
its director, Idil Eser, charging them as members of 
22
a terrorist organization. The charges against Kilic¸ 
23
were based on the mere allegation, later found to be 
24
false, that he had downloaded a messaging applica-
25
02:15 Aug 03, 2021

•HR 4546 IH
tion. Yet in July 2020, a Turkish court sentenced 
1
Kilic¸ to over 6 years in prison and Eser was sen-
2
tenced to more than 2 years in prison. 
3
(12) The Government of Turkey continues its 
4
unjust detention of Selhattin Demirtas¸, a Kurdish 
5
politician detained with other members of the Peo-
6
ple’s Democratic Party on November 4, 2016. 
7
Demirtas was a member of parliament at the time 
8
of his arrest for allegedly ‘‘carrying out terrorist 
9
propaganda’’ by speaking in support of peace nego-
10
tiations with the Kurdistan Workers’ Party. The Eu-
11
ropean Court of Human Rights ruled in November 
12
2018 that his detention ‘‘had pursued the predomi-
13
nant ulterior purpose of stifling pluralism and lim-
14
iting freedom of political debate, which was at the 
15
very core of the concept of a democratic society’’. In 
16
December 2020, the ECHR ruled that Turkey must 
17
‘‘immediately release’’ Demirtas from prison, which 
18
Turkey continues to ignore. 
19
(13) The Government of Turkey has targeted 
20
lawyers, with particular focus on criminal defense 
21
lawyers, prosecuting them for discharging their pro-
22
fessional duties and associating them, without evi-
23
dence, with the alleged crimes of their clients. Fair 
24
trial rights and protections for lawyers have been re-
25

•HR 4546 IH
stricted just as they are most critically needed given 
1
mass detentions and the wider crackdown on dissent. 
2
Police have also intimidated lawyers and obstructed 
3
their work 
4
(14) The Government of Turkey heavily re-
5
stricts and censors the internet. In 2019, the gov-
6
ernment blocked more than 408,000 websites, 
7
40,000 tweets, 10,000 YouTube videos, and 6,200 
8
Facebook shares, and blocked Wikipedia between 
9
2017 and 2020. In early 2021, the government en-
10
acted a new social media law, which threatens social 
11
media companies that do not obey requests to re-
12
move content. Twitter, and its live video-streaming 
13
services, are currently facing pressure in the form of 
14
advertising bans by the Government of Turkey as a 
15
result of their unwillingness to appoint local rep-
16
resentatives to handle government removal requests. 
17
(15) Turkey ranks among the countries with 
18
the highest number of content removal requests sent 
19
to Twitter and Facebook, according to the compa-
20
nies’ transparency reports. 
21
(16) The Government of Turkey has dem-
22
onstrated a disregard for fundamental freedoms be-
23
yond Turkey’s borders, including in the United 
24
States. In 2016, members of President Erdog˘an’s

security detail engaged in violence against journal-
1
ists reporting on an event at the Brookings Institu-
2
tion. During President Erdog˘an’s May 2017 visit to 
3
Washington, DC, individuals from the Turkish Em-
4
bassy grounds pushed past District of Columbia po-
5
lice officers to brutally attack individuals dem-
6
onstrating peacefully in opposition to policies of the 
7
Government of Turkey. 
8
(17) The Government of Turkey has abused 
9
international institutions to target critics, ‘‘trig-
10
gering a flood of Interpol ‘red notice’ requests to de-
11
tain critics abroad’’, according to Freedom House. 
12
(18) Since 2014, the Government of Turkey has 
13
pursued opponents and critics in more than 30 coun-
14
tries, securing the renditions of at least 58 people 
15
without due process in what Freedom House has 
16
characterized as a ‘‘campaign of transnational re-
17
pression’’, unrivaled by any other country. In a 
18
March 3, 2021 report, the Office of the High Com-
19
missioner for Human Rights stated that the increase 
20
in cases in arbitrary detention ‘‘may constitute 
21
crimes against humanity’’. 
22
(19) The Government of Turkey threatens to 
23
escalate its targeting of critics internationally, con-
24
sistent with an overly broad domestic counterter-

rorism campaign. On October 30, 2019, President 
1
Erdog˘an stated, ‘‘Some countries eliminate terrorists 
2
whom they consider as a threat to their national se-
3
curity, wherever they are. Therefore, this means 
4
those countries accept Turkey has the same right. 
5
This includes the terrorists they shake hands with 
6
and praise.’’ He added that he hoped to deliver 
7
‘‘good news’’ on the matter soon.

(1) the Government of Turkey must—
