RESOLUTION 
Congratulating the Tampa Bay Lightning for winning the 
2021 Stanley Cup Final. 
Whereas, on July 7, 2021, the Tampa Bay Lightning won 
the 2021 National Hockey League Stanley Cup Final at 
Amalie Arena in Tampa; 
Whereas back-to-back years, the Lightning repeat as Stanley 
Cup champs, this time, at home in a 9-month span; 
Whereas the Lightning won a second straight Stanley Cup 
Wednesday night with a 1–0 victory in Game 5 against 
the Canadiens to seal a 4–1 series win and made Tampa 
Bay just the second team since the salary cap era began 
in 2005–2006 to win back-to-back Stanley Cups, joining 
the 2016–2017 Pittsburgh Penguins;

Whereas community heroes were recognized at every Tampa 
Bay Lightning game; 
Whereas when the Tampa Bay Lightning play, it is ‘‘electri-
fying’’; 
Whereas Pat Maroon became the first player in nearly 40 
years to win the Cup in three consecutive seasons; 
Whereas Maroon won his third straight Cup, including last 
season with the Lightning and 2018–2019 with the 
Blues; 
Whereas no big-time team has ever gone back-to-back in 
Tampa Bay like the Lightning have done; 
Whereas the Lightning are third in the National Hockey 
League (NHL) in regular-season victories and are now 
one of four teams to have won two Stanley Cups in that 
time; 
Whereas Andrei Vasilevskiy ended the season with his record 
fifth straight series-clinching shutout in the playoffs; 
Whereas Vasilevskiy, who made 22 saves in the victory, won 
the Conn Smythe Trophy as the postseason’s most valu-
able player, a rarity for a goaltender; 
Whereas Vasilevskiy claimed the postseason Most Valuable 
Player award after the Lightning’s 1–0 win over the 
Montreal Canadiens, repeating as Stanley Cup cham-
pions, becoming the first goaltender born outside of 
North America and the third Russian to win the honor, 
and the third goalie in NHL history to post multiple 
shutouts in Stanley Cup clinching games; 
Whereas Vasilevskiy is also the first goaltender since the 
Canadiens’ Ken Dryden to play in every playoff game en 
route to back-to-back Stanley Cups (1977–1978);

Whereas Vasilevskiy becomes the 16th goalie to win the 
award and the first Lightning goaltender to do so; 
Whereas Vasilevskiy won the Conn Smythe Trophy, and is 
the first goaltender to win the award since the Kings’ 
Jonathan Quick in 2012; 
Whereas rookie forward Ross Colton and defenseman David 
Savard, acquired at the trade deadline, connected for the 
game’s only goal with 6:33 left in the second period; 
Whereas the Lightning won a puck battle against the near 
boards, and the puck landed with Savard along the far 
side, and once the Lightning won possession, Colton won 
a joust with Canadiens defenseman Joel Edmundson for 
positioning in front of the net, and he redirected Savard’s 
pass through traffic into the back of the net; 
Whereas the Lightning have not lost back-to-back games at 
any point over their last two playoff runs, moving to 14– 
0 on Wednesday following the Game 4 overtime loss in 
Montreal; 
Whereas first-line mate Brayden Point had a playoff-high 14 
goals and scored in 9 consecutive games; 
Whereas Victor Hedman, last season’s Conn Smythe winner, 
led all defensemen with 18 points; 
Whereas the Lightning have dominated the NHL over the 
past seven seasons in ways few teams can: six playoff 
berths, five conference final appearances, three Stanley 
Cup Finals appearances, and two Cups; 
Whereas defenseman Ryan McDonagh dug the puck out of a 
scrum along the leftside boards and passed to Savard, 
who skated to the right faceoff dot, and Savard sent a 
shot-pass into the slot for Colton, who one-timed the

puck past Price to put the Lightning ahead with 6:33 to 
play in the second period; 
Whereas Colton redirected a David Savard pass into the slot 
with 6:33 remaining in the second period as Tampa Bay 
became the first team since Chicago in 2015 to win an 
NHL title on home ice; 
Whereas the entire roster contributed to the Stanley Cup vic-
tory: Nikita Kucherov, Andrei Vasilevskiy, Steven 
Stamkos, Brayden Point, Patrick Maroon, Ross Colton, 
Victor Hedman, David Savard, Tyler Johnson, Ryan 
McDonagh, Alex Killorn, Matieu Joseph, Blake Coleman, 
Anthony Cirelli, Mikhail Sergachev, Yanni Gourde, Erik 
Cˇerna´k, Curtis McElhinney, Barclay Goodrow, Luke 
Schenn, Maria´n Ga´borı´k, Jan Rutta, Christopher Gibson, 
Ondrˇej Pala´t, Alex Barre´-Boulet, Callan Foote, Gemel 
Smith, Daniel Walcott, Anders Nilsson, Mitchell Ste-
phens, Andreas Borgman, Fredrik Claesson, Brois 
Katchouk, Taylor Raddysh, Spencer Martin, and Ben 
Thomas; 
Whereas the Lightning defeated the Dallas Stars in Sep-
tember to win the Cup in the bubble in Edmonton, Al-
berta, and the franchise’s only other Cup title came in 
2004; 
Whereas, in 2021, they repeated to become the fastest team 
ever to bag consecutive titles, doing so by a margin of 
nearly 3 months; 
Whereas star forward Nikita Kucherov was also a key factor 
down the stretch for the Lightning, and he joined Mario 
Lemiuex as the only players to lead the NHL in points 
in consecutive playoffs;

Whereas Kucherov finished the 2021 postseason with 32 
points as he tallied 8 goals and 24 assists after missing 
the entire regular season due to hip surgery; and 
Whereas the Lightning forward has recorded 66 points over 
the past two postseasons, which is tied for fifth-most over 
two consecutive postseasons: Now, therefore, be it
