SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Suspending Normal 
2
Trade Relations with Russia and Belarus Act’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) The United States is a founding member of 
6
the World Trade Organization (WTO) and is com-
7
mitted to ensuring that the WTO remains an effec-
8
tive forum for peaceful economic engagement. 
9
(2) Ukraine is a sovereign nation-state that is 
10
entitled to enter into agreements with other sov-
11
ereign states and to full respect of its territorial in-
12
tegrity. 
13
(3) The United States will be unwavering in its 
14
support for a secure, democratic, and sovereign 
15
Ukraine, free to choose its own leaders and future. 
16
(4) Ukraine acceded to the Marrakesh Agree-
17
ment Establishing the World Trade Organization 
18
(WTO Agreement) and has been a WTO member 
19
since 2008. 
20
(5) Ukraine’s participation in the WTO Agree-
21
ment creates both rights and obligations vis-a`-vis 
22
other WTO members. 
23
(6) The Russian Federation acceded to the 
24
WTO on August 22, 2012, becoming the 156th 
25
3 
•HR 7108 EH
WTO member, and the Republic of Belarus has ap-
1
plied to accede to the WTO. 
2
(7) From the date of its accession, the Russian 
3
Federation committed to apply fully all provisions of 
4
the WTO. 
5
(8) The United States Congress authorized per-
6
manent normal trade relations for the Russian Fed-
7
eration through the Russia and Moldova Jackson- 
8
Vanik Repeal and Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law 
9
Accountability Act of 2012 (Public Law 112–208). 
10
(9) Ukraine communicated to the WTO General 
11
Council on March 2, 2022, urging that all WTO 
12
members take action against the Russian Federation 
13
and ‘‘consider further steps with the view to sus-
14
pending the Russian Federation’s participation in 
15
the WTO for its violation of the purpose and prin-
16
ciples of this Organization’’. 
17
(10) Vladimir Putin, a ruthless dictator, has led 
18
the Russian Federation into a war of aggression 
19
against Ukraine, which— 
20
(A) denies Ukraine and its people their col-
21
lective rights to independence, sovereignty, and 
22
territorial integrity; 
23
(B) constitutes an emergency in inter-
24
national relations, because it is a situation of 
25
4 
•HR 7108 EH
armed conflict that threatens the peace and se-
1
curity of all countries, including the United 
2
States; and 
3
(C) denies Ukraine its rightful ability to 
4
participate in international organizations, in-
5
cluding the WTO. 
6
(11) The Republic of Belarus, also led by a 
7
ruthless dictator, Aleksander Lukashenka, is pro-
8
viding important material support to the Russian 
9
Federation’s aggression. 
10
(12) The Russian Federation’s exportation of 
11
goods in the energy sector is central to its ability to 
12
wage its war of aggression on Ukraine. 
13
(13) The United States, along with its allies 
14
and partners, has responded to recent aggression by 
15
the Russian Federation in Ukraine by imposing 
16
sweeping financial sanctions and stringent export 
17
controls. 
18
(14) The United States cannot allow the con-
19
sequences of the Russian Federation’s actions to go 
20
unaddressed, and must lead fellow countries, in all 
21
fora, including the WTO, to impose appropriate con-
22
sequences for the Russian Federation’s aggression.
