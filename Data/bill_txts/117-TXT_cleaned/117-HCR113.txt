CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 
Commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Federal Water 
Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, commonly 
known as the ‘‘Clean Water Act’’. 
Whereas the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (commonly 
known, and referred to in this resolution, as the ‘‘Clean 
Water Act’’) is one of the most important environmental 
laws in the United States and the Nation’s principal safe-
guard against pollution, degradation, and destruction of 
surface waters, including streams, rivers, wetlands, and 
lakes; 
Whereas implementation of the Clean Water Act has resulted 
in progress towards the objective of the legislation to ‘‘re-
store and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological 
integrity of the Nation’s waters’’ by—

(1) significantly reducing water pollution; 
(2) substantially improving the quality of tens of 
thousands of waterbodies; and 
(3) dramatically reducing the rate of wetlands loss; 
Whereas, despite the improvements brought about by imple-
mentation of the Clean Water Act, failure to fully achieve 
the intended goals of the Clean Water Act are due to— 
(1) changes to interpretation of the Clean Water 
Act, which have weakened protections for the Nation’s 
waters; 
(2) lack of adequate and equitable investments in 
clean water infrastructure and funding to implement and 
enforce the Clean Water Act; and 
(3) weak and inequitable enforcement and implemen-
tation of critical provisions of the Clean Water Act; 
Whereas, as the United States embarks on the next 50 years 
of the Clean Water Act, Congress envisions— 
(1) expanded access to clean water for every commu-
nity by— 
(A) protecting waters with cultural, historical, 
spiritual, and religious significance; 
(B) ensuring that rivers, streams, and other 
waterbodies are fishable and swimmable and serve as 
safe and reliable sources of recreation, drinking 
water, and subsistence; 
(C) restoring and safeguarding waterways and 
wetlands that provide vital fish and wildlife habitat 
and protect communities from floods and droughts; 
and 
(D) making healthy shorelines, waterfronts, and 
water-related recreation available and welcoming to 
all;

tion; 
(3) providing incentives for natural infrastructure 
and nature-based solutions;

(6) ensuring affordable clean water services for all; 
(7) protecting and restoring ecosystems by— 
(A) eliminating harmful algal blooms, algal tox-
ins in drinking water supplies, and ‘‘dead zones’’ by 
reducing inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus from the 
most significant sources; 
(B) preventing destruction and degradation of 
remaining wetlands and restoring and protecting 
wetlands across the country; 
(C) restoring all waters, especially the most pol-
luted waterways and waterways in the communities 
most impacted by pollution; 
(D) incorporating climate change science and 
modeling and indigenous knowledge into planning 
and restoration efforts; 
(E) improving water quality, healthy river 
flows, and groundwater recharge;
