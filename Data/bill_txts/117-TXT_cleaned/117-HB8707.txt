SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. 
1
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Food insecurity, epidemic levels of obesity, 
3
hypertension, diabetes, and youth osteoporosis are 
4
caused by improper nutrition yielded by lack of nu-
5
tritious, reliable, and locally available healthy food 
6
options. 
7
(2) The American Diabetes Association esti-
8
mated a 41-percent increase in costs of diagnosed 
9
diabetes from 2007 ($174,000,000,000) to 2012 
10
($245,000,000,000) with most of these costs (62 
11
percent) coming from senior health programs such 
12
as Medicare and Medicaid. 
13
(3) Since sequestration in 2008, there has been 
14
no funding increase for the Seniors Farmers’ Market 
15
Nutrition Program. 
16
(4) From 2008 to 2020, the moderate at home 
17
food cost for a family of 2 (aged 51–70 years old) 
18
increased by an average of $70 a month. Seniors 
19
Farmers’ Market Nutrition Program funding has 
20
not kept pace with such inflation. 
21
(5) According to the Department of Agri-
22
culture, Seniors Farmers’ Market Nutrition Pro-
23
gram has a total program funding backlog of 
24
$20,065,021 and a season benefit level backlog of 
25
20:25 Oct 25, 2022

•HR 8707 IH
$16,120,741 across all participating States, terri-
1
tories, and Native American Tribes. 
2
(6) Roughly 1 in 10 United States senior citi-
3
zens (about 5,146,000) are forced to live well below 
4
the Federal poverty level, and the Seniors Farmers’ 
5
Market Nutrition Program is only able to reach 
6
about 725,000 due to inadequate funding. 
7
(7) Since sequestration in 2008, funding for 
8
farmers’ market nutrition programs has fallen by 
9
over $6,000,000 and never rebounded. 
10
(8) The farmers’ market nutrition program is a 
11
vital safeguard for the nearly 1 in 7 children who 
12
will be born into poverty in the United States and 
13
will be at nutritional risk. 
14
(9) According to the Department of Agri-
15
culture, the farmers’ market nutrition program has 
16
a total program and seasonal benefit funding back-
17
log of $6,198,432 across all participating States, 
18
territories, and Native American Tribes. 
19
(10) In the United States, food banks will pro-
20
vide meals to 1 in 7 people. 
21
(11) Many food banks share special relation-
22
ships with local farmers who often donate their 
23
crops to food banks. The partnership allows for 
24
20:25 Oct 25, 2022

•HR 8707 IH
more efficient and sustainable procurement for food 
1
banks. 
2
(12) Assisting food banks to grow their own 
3
food will aid local procurement and allow food banks 
4
to serve as farming resources to their communities, 
5
especially to those who are food insecure. 
6
(13) The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 
7
specifically required looking at ways to incorporate 
8
local goods to reduce food waste. 
9
(b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this Act are— 
10
(1) to increase and enhance funding for farm-
11
ers’ market nutrition programs to support seniors, 
12
food insecure families, and to increase market capac-
13
ity for local farmers; 
14
(2) to provide funding assistance for the expan-
15
sion and construction of farmers markets in both 
16
rural and urban food desert areas; and 
17
(3) to increase local food production through 
18
partnership with food banks by local farmer con-
19
tracting and funding assistance to food banks to 
20
grow necessary produce through traditional or con-
21
trolled environment agricultural farming.
