SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Current law and regulations require certain 
8
financial institutions, including depository institu-
9
tions, savings associations, and credit unions, to 
10
have a Customer Identification Program to identify 
11
customers who wish to open accounts. 
12
(2) A financial institution must have risk-based 
13
procedures for evaluating new customers that allow 
14
the financial institution to form a reasonable belief 
15
that the financial institution knows the true identity 
16
of the customer. 
17
(3) Guidance on the Consumer Identification 
18
Program has not been updated since the staff of the 
19
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 
20
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Financial 
21
Crimes Enforcement Network, National Credit 
22
Union Administration, Office of the Comptroller of 
23

1
agency Interpretive Guidance on Customer Identi-
2
fication Program Requirements under Section 326 
3
of the USA PATRIOT Act, 2005 FAQs’’. 
4
(4) Over the last decade more than two dozen 
5
cities and counties in the United States have insti-
6
tuted municipal identification programs, issuing a 
7
form of identification to residents who typically do 
8
not have driver’s licenses, including young people, 
9
the elderly, homeless residents, and immigrants. 
10
(5) Municipal identification programs help vul-
11
nerable populations access private and public serv-
12
ices, including library services, utility accounts, food, 
13
medical care, and housing assistance. 
14
(6) While the Agencies have issued statements 
15
about the use of municipal identification for con-
16
sumer identification, many financial institutions 
17
have been hesitant to incorporate municipal identi-
18
fication into the Consumer Identification Programs, 
19
limiting access to banking for underserved popu-
20
lations. 
21
(7) It is important for the Agencies to clarify, 
22
in guidance, that financial institutions may accept 
23
municipal identification to establish a customer’s 
24
identity if such identification enables the bank to

to state that an identification card issued by a munici-
