RESOLUTION 
Condemning the use of hunger as a weapon of war and 
recognizing the effect of conflict on global food security 
and famine. 
Whereas in 2020, 155,000,000 people experienced crisis lev-
els of food insecurity (Integrated Food Security Phase 
Classification phase 3 or above), with nearly 100,000,000 
people living in environments where conflict was the main 
driver of this crisis, and the COVID–19 pandemic has 
worsened rising global food insecurity; 
Whereas conflict acutely impacts vulnerable populations such 
as women and children, persons with disabilities, refu-
gees, and internally displaced persons; 
Whereas armed conflict impacts on food security can be di-
rect, such as displacement from land, destruction of live-

stock grazing areas and fishing grounds, or destruction 
of food stocks and agricultural assets, or indirect, such 
as disruptions to food systems, leading to increased food 
prices or decreased household purchasing power, or de-
creased access to supplies that are necessary for food 
preparation, including water and fuel; 
Whereas conflict disrupts the distribution and buying and 
selling of food within a food system due to a shortage of 
produce, risk, or perceived risk of travel, the formation 
of illegal distribution channels and markets, and the 
breakdown of a government’s ability to enforce regula-
tions or perform its judiciary functions; 
Whereas aerial bombing campaigns targeting agricultural 
heartlands, scorched earth methods of warfare, and the 
use of landmines and other explosive devices have direct 
impacts on the ability of vulnerable populations to feed 
themselves; 
Whereas effective humanitarian response in armed conflict, 
including in the threat of conflict-induced famine and 
food insecurity in situations of armed conflict, requires 
respect for international humanitarian law by all parties 
to the conflict, and allowing and facilitating the rapid 
and unimpeded movement of humanitarian relief to all 
those in need; 
Whereas efforts to restrict humanitarian aid and the oper-
ational integrity and impartiality of humanitarian aid 
works and distribution efforts, including through block-
ades, security impediments, or irregular bureaucratic re-
quirements is another means by which combatants em-
ploy starvation and food deprivation as a weapon of war;

the Global Food Security Act of 2016 (Public Law 114–
