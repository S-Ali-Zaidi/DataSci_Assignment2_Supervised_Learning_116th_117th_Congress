RESOLUTION 
Supporting the goals and ideals of ‘‘Deep Vein Thrombosis 
and Pulmonary Embolism Awareness Month’’. 
Whereas deep vein thrombosis (referred to in this resolution 
as ‘‘DVT’’) is a condition that occurs when a blood clot 
forms in the deep veins of the body, most commonly in 
the leg, although it can occur anywhere in the body, such 
as the veins in the arm, abdomen, or around the brain; 
Whereas a potentially life-threatening complication of DVT is 
pulmonary embolism (in this resolution referred to as 
‘‘PE’’), where a blood clot breaks off, travels through the 
blood stream and lodges in the lung; 
Whereas DVT/PE is a serious, but often preventable, medical 
condition;

•HRES 1174 IH 
Whereas DVT/PE occurs in an estimated 900,000 individuals 
in the United States each year; 
Whereas DVT/PE kills an estimated 100,000 individuals in 
the United States each year, more than AIDS, breast 
cancer, and prostate cancer combined; 
Whereas DVT/PE deaths are often preventable; 
Whereas DVT/PE is the leading cause of preventable hospital 
death in the United States; 
Whereas DVT/PE is a common complication in cancer pa-
tients and the leading cause of death in people with can-
cer after the cancer itself; 
Whereas pregnancy increases risk of DVT/PE, and that risk 
remains elevated for up to 6 weeks after giving birth; 
Whereas immobility, surgery, older age, a family history of 
clotting, and thrombophilia increase risk of DVT/PE; 
Whereas 
DVT/PE 
contributes 
to 
an 
estimated 
$10,000,000,000 in incremental medical costs each year 
in the United States; and 
Whereas the establishment of March as Deep Vein Throm-
bosis and Pulmonary Embolism Awareness Month would 
raise awareness about this life-threatening but prevent-
able condition: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
