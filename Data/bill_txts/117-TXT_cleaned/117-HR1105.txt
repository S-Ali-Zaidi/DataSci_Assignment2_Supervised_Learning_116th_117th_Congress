RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for increasing the number of Latino stu-
dents and young professionals entering careers in science, 
technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. 
Whereas the Latino population in the United States has 
grown significantly over the years on a national basis and 
Latinos accounted for more than 62,000,000 residents in 
2020; 
Whereas the number of Latinos enrolled at an institution of 
higher education has increased from 2,900,000 in 2010, 
to 3,600,000 in 2019;

Whereas Latinos are responsible for 78 percent of the growth 
of the United States labor force since the Great Reces-
sion of 2007 to 2009; 
Whereas the Latino population is growing more rapidly than 
the non-Latino population, and has a younger median 
age of 29.5, as compared to 40.6 years among non- 
Latinos; 
Whereas the overall number of science, technology, engineer-
ing, and mathematics (STEM) graduates increased, but 
Latino workers remain underrepresented in the STEM 
workforce, making up 18 percent of total employees 
across all occupations, but only 8 percent of all STEM 
workers; 
Whereas the percentage of Latino workers in STEM occupa-
tions has increased, but the increase has only been 1 per-
cent annually since 2016; 
Whereas the attractiveness of STEM career paths is evi-
denced by the fact that the number of bachelor’s degrees 
in STEM increased for all citizens of the United States 
by 62 percent between 2010 and 2018 in comparison to 
a 20 percent growth for all other degrees; 
Whereas while surveys indicate that Latino students are in-
terested in STEM education and aspire to STEM careers 
at similar rates as overrepresented groups, they make up 
a disproportionately low share of the STEM workforce; 
Whereas many Latino students are not adequately prepared 
or well-positioned to take full advantage of financial aid 
opportunities to attend an institution of higher education; 
Whereas the National Center for Education Statistics reports 
that with 70 percent of Latino students having unmet fi-
nancial needs, the highest of any demographic, this is es-

pecially true in the case of first generation college stu-
dents in Latino families, making it far more difficult for 
them to pursue STEM education and careers; 
Whereas the growth of well-paying STEM jobs is expected to 
outpace non-STEM jobs in the coming years, making 
STEM fields even more attractive for Latino students 
and young adults and increasing the need for new strate-
gies to facilitate their entrance; and 
Whereas greater investment in the Latino community will 
generate more individuals eager to pursue STEM jobs 
and will greatly increase our domestic high-skilled work-
force: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the goal of increasing Latino indi-
2
viduals in science, technology, engineering, and 
3
mathematics (STEM) as a way to promote economic 
4
empowerment and sustainability, not only in their 
5
community, but in the overall United States econ-
6
omy; 
7
(2) acknowledges that, while Latino individuals 
8
have been a foundation for the United States econ-
9
omy, they are underrepresented in STEM fields to 
10
the detriment of these industries and the broader 
11
United States economy; 
12
(3) acknowledges that a strong commitment to-
13
ward diversity and inclusion, which has been shown 
14
to improve the performance of the STEM workforce, 
15
will require greater investment in our Latino com-

munity and this emphasis will help develop talented 
1
and capable STEM workers, reduce our Nation’s de-
2
pendence on foreign workers, and secure our Na-
3
tion’s future as a leader in STEM; 
4
(4) encourages increased Federal support for 
5
initiatives aimed at boosting the number of Latino 
6
students who pursue STEM education and career 
7
paths, particularly engineering; and 
8
(5) recognizes the important role that Hispanic- 
9
serving institutions and all institutions of higher 
10
education must play in order to achieve this goal of 
11
increasing Latino individuals in STEM.
