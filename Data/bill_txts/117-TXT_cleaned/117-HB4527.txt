less than one percent of the American population 
1
serves in the Armed Forces. 
2
(2) Each branch of the Armed Forces (Army, 
3
Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Space Force, and 
4
Coast Guard) instills in its members a sense of duty 
5
and obligation to the United States, their branch of 
6
service, and their comrades-in-arms. 
7
(3) The Department of Veterans Affairs esti-
8
mates that approximately 20 veterans of the Armed 
9
Forces commit suicide each day, and a veteran’s risk 
10
of suicide is 21 percent higher than an adult who 
11
has not served in the Armed Forces. 
12
(4) The Department of Veterans Affairs is ag-
13
gressively undertaking measures to prevent these 
14
tragic outcomes, yet suicide rates among veterans 
15
remain unacceptably high. 
16
(5) Upon enlistment or appointment in the 
17
Armed Forces, a new member is obligated to take an 
18
oath of office or oath of enlistment. 
19
(6) Most members of the Armed Forces view 
20
this oath not as an imposition, but as a promise that 
21
they are bound to fulfill.

23
tion 502 of title 10, United States Code, is amended—
