A BILL 
To amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to 
allow the sponsor of a drug to use a non-animal test 
as an alternative to an animal test for purposes of dem-
onstrating the safety and effectiveness of a drug if such 
approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable 
statutes and regulations. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
5
The Congress finds that— 
6
(1) the Food and Drug Administration (in this 
7
section referred to as the ‘‘FDA’’) often requires 
8
pharmaceutical companies to conduct or commission 
9
testing on dogs and other animals to assess the safe-
10
ty or effectiveness of new drugs, even though such 
11
testing is inefficient, expensive, and ineffective; 
12
(2) the National Institutes of Health states, 
13
‘‘Approximately 30 percent of promising medications 
14
have failed in human clinical trials because they are 
15
found to be toxic despite promising preclinical stud-
16
ies in animal models. About 60 percent of candidate 
17
drugs fail due to lack of efficacy’’; 
18
(3) current FDA nonbinding pharmaceutical 
19
testing guidelines support the use of alternatives to 
20
animal testing to improve the effectiveness and effi-
21
ciency of drug development; 
22
(4) current FDA drug testing guidance for the 
23
pharmaceutical 
industry 
states, 
‘‘consideration 
24
should be given to use of new in vitro alternative 
25
methods for safety evaluation’’;

•HR 1905 IH
(5) the FDA’s drug testing guidance for indus-
1
try additionally states, ‘‘alternative approaches . . . 
2
can also be used . . . . The use of any of these ap-
3
proaches can reduce overall animal use in drug de-
4
velopment’’; 
5
(6) the FDA writes that alternatives to animal 
6
testing, ‘‘may help bring FDA-regulated products to 
7
market faster, with improved efficacy, or prevent 
8
products with increased toxicological risk from 
9
reaching the market. Also critical is the potential for 
10
these advances to replace, reduce, and/or refine ani-
11
mal testing’’; 
12
(7) pharmaceutical companies are reducing ani-
13
mal testing by investing in the development and use 
14
of alternative methods, which studies show are often 
15
more effective and efficient than traditional animal 
16
use; 
17
(8) the FDA states, ‘‘FDA encourages sponsors 
18
to consult with us if they wish to use a non-animal 
19
testing method they believe is suitable, adequate, 
20
validated, and feasible’’; and 
21
(9) in some cases, drug manufacturers and 
22
sponsors have not been allowed by the FDA to use 
23
alternatives to animal testing to fulfill regulatory re-

quirements, despite the FDA’s support for this tech-

nology in its industry guidance document.

SEC. 3. ALTERNATIVES TO ANIMAL TESTS. 
3
Section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic 
4
Act (21 U.S.C. 355) is amended by adding at the end the 
5
following new subsection: 
6
‘‘(z) ALTERNATIVES TO ANIMAL TESTS.—The Sec-
7
retary shall allow the sponsor of a drug to use a non-ani-
8
mal test as an alternative to an animal test for purposes 
9
of demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of a drug 
10
under this section if such approach satisfies the require-
11
ments of the applicable statutes and regulations.’’.
