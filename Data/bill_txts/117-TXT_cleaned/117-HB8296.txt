A BILL 
To protect a person’s ability to determine whether to con-
tinue or end a pregnancy, and to protect a health care 
provider’s ability to provide abortion services. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Women’s Health Pro-
4
tection Act of 2022’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. 
6
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) On June 24, 2022, in its decision in Dobbs 
8
v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the Su-
9
20:44 Jul 07, 2022
H8296
2 
•HR 8296 IH
preme Court overruled Roe v. Wade, reversing dec-
1
ades of precedent recognizing the constitutional 
2
right to terminate a pregnancy before fetal viability, 
3
and to terminate a pregnancy after fetal viability 
4
where it is necessary, in the good-faith medical judg-
5
ment of the treating health care professional, for the 
6
preservation of the life or health of the person who 
7
is pregnant. 
8
(2) In their joint dissent, Justices Breyer, 
9
Sotomayor, and Kagan write, ‘‘[The majority] says 
10
that from the very moment of fertilization, a woman 
11
has no rights to speak of. A State can force her to 
12
bring a pregnancy to term, even at the steepest per-
13
sonal and familial costs.’’. 
14
(3) The dissenting Justices continue, ‘‘The Mis-
15
sissippi law at issue here bars abortions after the 
16
15th week of pregnancy. Under the majority’s rul-
17
ing, though, another State’s law could do so after 
18
ten weeks, or five or three or one—or, again, from 
19
the moment of fertilization. States have already 
20
passed such laws, in anticipation of today’s ruling. 
21
More will follow.’’. 
22
(4) The dissenting Justices also stated, ‘‘one re-
23
sult of [the] decision is certain; the curtailment of 
24
20:44 Jul 07, 2022
H8296
3 
•HR 8296 IH
women’s rights, and of their status as free and equal 
1
citizens.’’. 
2
(5) Indeed, some States acted to ban abortion 
3
outright in the immediate aftermath of the Dobbs 
4
decision, with half the States in the country expected 
5
to ban abortion entirely in the days and weeks to 
6
come. 
7
(6) Even before Roe was overturned, access to 
8
abortion services had been obstructed across the 
9
United States in various ways, including blockades 
10
of health care facilities and associated violence, pro-
11
hibitions of, and restrictions on, insurance coverage; 
12
parental involvement laws (notification and consent); 
13
restrictions that shame and stigmatize people seek-
14
ing abortion services; and medically unnecessary reg-
15
ulations that neither confer any health benefit nor 
16
further the safety of abortion services, but which 
17
harm people by delaying, complicating access to, and 
18
reducing the availability of, abortion services. 
19
(7) Abortion services are essential to health 
20
care, and access to those services is central to peo-
21
ple’s ability to participate equally in the economic 
22
and social life of the United States. Abortion access 
23
allows people who are pregnant to make their own 
24
20:44 Jul 07, 2022
H8296
4 
•HR 8296 IH
decisions about their pregnancies, their families, and 
1
their lives. 
2
(8) Reproductive justice requires every indi-
3
vidual to have the right to make their own decisions 
4
about having children regardless of their cir-
5
cumstances and without interference and discrimina-
6
tion. Reproductive Justice is a human right that can 
7
and will be achieved when all people, regardless of 
8
actual or perceived race, color, national origin, immi-
9
gration status, sex (including gender identity, sex 
10
stereotyping, or sexual orientation), age, or disability 
11
status have the economic, social, and political power 
12
and resources to define and make decisions about 
13
their bodies, health, sexuality, families, and commu-
14
nities in all areas of their lives, with dignity and 
15
self-determination. 
16
(9) Reproductive justice seeks to address re-
17
strictions on reproductive health, including abortion, 
18
that perpetuate systems of oppression, lack of bodily 
19
autonomy, white supremacy, and anti-Black racism. 
20
This violent legacy has manifested in policies includ-
21
ing enslavement, rape, and experimentation on Black 
22
women; forced sterilizations; medical experimen-
23
tation on low-income women’s reproductive systems; 
24
and the forcible removal of Indigenous children. Ac-
25
20:44 Jul 07, 2022
H8296
5 
•HR 8296 IH
cess to equitable reproductive health care, including 
1
abortion services, has always been deficient in the 
2
United States for Black, Indigenous, and other Peo-
3
ple of Color (BIPOC) and their families. 
4
(10) The legacy of restrictions on reproductive 
5
health, rights, and justice is not a dated vestige of 
6
a dark history. Presently, the harms of abortion-spe-
7
cific restrictions fall especially heavily on people with 
8
low incomes, BIPOC, immigrants, young people, 
9
people with disabilities, and those living in rural and 
10
other medically underserved areas. Abortion-specific 
11
restrictions are even more compounded by the ongo-
12
ing criminalization of people who are pregnant, in-
13
cluding those who are incarcerated, living with HIV, 
14
or with substance-use disorders. These communities 
15
already experience health disparities due to social, 
16
political, and environmental inequities, and restric-
17
tions on abortion services exacerbate these harms. 
18
Removing medically unjustified restrictions on abor-
19
tion services would constitute one important step on 
20
the path toward realizing Reproductive Justice by 
21
ensuring that the full range of reproductive health 
22
care is accessible to all who need it. 
23
(11) Abortion-specific restrictions are a tool of 
24
gender oppression, as they target health care serv-
25
20:44 Jul 07, 2022
H8296
6 
•HR 8296 IH
ices that are used primarily by women. These pater-
1
nalistic restrictions rely on and reinforce harmful 
2
stereotypes about gender roles, women’s decision- 
3
making, and women’s need for protection instead of 
4
support, undermining their ability to control their 
5
own lives and well-being. These restrictions harm the 
6
basic autonomy, dignity, and equality of women, and 
7
their ability to participate in the social and economic 
8
life of the Nation. 
9
(12) The terms ‘‘woman’’ and ‘‘women’’ are 
10
used in this bill to reflect the identity of the majority 
11
of people targeted and affected by restrictions on 
12
abortion services, and to address squarely the tar-
13
geted restrictions on abortion, which are rooted in 
14
misogyny. However, access to abortion services is 
15
critical to the health of every person capable of be-
16
coming pregnant. This Act is intended to protect all 
17
people with the capacity for pregnancy—cisgender 
18
women, transgender men, non-binary individuals, 
19
those who identify with a different gender, and oth-
20
ers—who are unjustly harmed by restrictions on 
21
abortion services. 
22
(13) Since 2011, States and local governments 
23
have passed nearly 500 restrictions singling out 
24
health care providers who offer abortion services, 
25
20:44 Jul 07, 2022
H8296
7 
•HR 8296 IH
interfering with their ability to provide those services 
1
and the patients’ ability to obtain those services. 
2
(14) Many State and local governments have 
3
imposed restrictions on the provision of abortion 
4
services that are neither evidence-based nor gen-
5
erally applicable to the medical profession or to 
6
other medically comparable outpatient gynecological 
7
procedures, such as endometrial ablations, dilation 
8
and curettage for reasons other than abortion, 
9
hysteroscopies, loop electrosurgical excision proce-
10
dures, or other analogous non-gynecological proce-
11
dures performed in similar outpatient settings in-
12
cluding vasectomy, sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy. 
13
(15) Abortion is essential health care and one 
14
of the safest medical procedures in the United 
15
States. An independent, comprehensive review of the 
16
state of science on the safety and quality of abortion 
17
services, published by the National Academies of 
18
Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine in 2018, found 
19
that abortion in the United States is safe and effec-
20
tive and that the biggest threats to the quality of 
21
abortion services in the United States are State reg-
22
ulations that create barriers to care. These abortion- 
23
specific restrictions conflict with medical standards 
24
and are not supported by the recommendations and 
25
20:44 Jul 07, 2022
H8296
8 
•HR 8296 IH
guidelines issued by leading reproductive health care 
1
professional organizations including the American 
2
College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Soci-
3
ety of Family Planning, the National Abortion Fed-
4
eration, the World Health Organization, and others. 
5
(16) Many abortion-specific restrictions do not 
6
confer any health or safety benefits on the patient. 
7
Instead, these restrictions have the purpose and ef-
8
fect of unduly burdening people’s personal and pri-
9
vate medical decisions to end their pregnancies by 
10
making access to abortion services more difficult, 
11
invasive, and costly, often forcing people to travel 
12
significant distances and make multiple unnecessary 
13
visits to the provider, and in some cases, foreclosing 
14
the option altogether. For example, a 2018 report 
15
from the University of California San Francisco’s 
16
Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health 
17
research group found that in 27 cities across the 
18
United States, people have to travel more than 100 
19
miles in any direction to reach an abortion provider. 
20
(17) An overwhelming majority of abortions in 
21
the United States are provided in clinics, not hos-
22
pitals, but the large majority of counties throughout 
23
the United States have no clinics that provide abor-
24
tion. 
25
20:44 Jul 07, 2022
H8296
9 
•HR 8296 IH
(18) These restrictions additionally harm peo-
1
ple’s health by reducing access not only to abortion 
2
services but also to other essential health care serv-
3
ices offered by many of the providers targeted by the 
4
restrictions, including— 
5
(A) screenings and preventive services, in-
6
cluding contraceptive services; 
7
(B) testing and treatment for sexually 
8
transmitted infections; 
9
(C) LGBTQ health services; and 
10
(D) referrals for primary care, intimate 
11
partner violence prevention, prenatal care and 
12
adoption services. 
13
(19) The cumulative effect of these numerous 
14
restrictions has been to severely limit, and now 
15
eliminate entirely, the availability of abortion serv-
16
ices in some areas, creating a patchwork system 
17
where the provision of abortion services is legal in 
18
some States and illegal in others. A 2019 report 
19
from the Government Accountability Office exam-
20
ining State Medicaid compliance with abortion cov-
21
erage requirements analyzed seven key challenges 
22
(identified both by health care providers and re-
23
search literature) and their effect on abortion access, 
24
20:44 Jul 07, 2022
H8296
10 
•HR 8296 IH
and found that access to abortion services varied 
1
across the States and even within a State. 
2
(20) International human rights law recognizes 
3
that access to abortion is intrinsically linked to the 
4
rights to life, health, equality and non-discrimina-
5
tion, privacy, and freedom from ill-treatment. United 
6
Nations (UN) human rights treaty monitoring bod-
7
ies have found that legal abortion services, like other 
8
reproductive health care services, must be available, 
9
accessible, affordable, acceptable, and of good qual-
10
ity. UN human rights treaty bodies have likewise 
11
condemned medically unnecessary barriers to abor-
12
tion services, including mandatory waiting periods, 
13
biased counseling requirements, and third-party au-
14
thorization requirements. 
15
(21) Core human rights treaties ratified by the 
16
United States protect access to abortion. For exam-
17
ple, in 2018, the UN Human Rights Committee, 
18
which oversees implementation of the ICCPR, made 
19
clear that the right to life, enshrined in Article 6 of 
20
the ICCPR, at a minimum requires governments to 
21
provide safe, legal, and effective access to abortion 
22
where a person’s life and health is at risk, or when 
23
carrying a pregnancy to term would cause substan-
24
tial pain or suffering. The Committee stated that 
25
20:44 Jul 07, 2022
H8296
11 
•HR 8296 IH
governments must not impose restrictions on abor-
1
tion which subject women and girls to physical or 
2
mental pain or suffering, discriminate against them, 
3
arbitrarily interfere with their privacy, or place them 
4
at risk of undertaking unsafe abortions. Further-
5
more, the Committee stated that governments should 
6
remove existing barriers that deny effective access to 
7
safe and legal abortion, refrain from introducing 
8
new barriers to abortion, and prevent the stigmatiza-
9
tion of those seeking abortion. 
10
(22) UN independent human rights experts 
11
have expressed particular concern about barriers to 
12
abortion services in the United States. For example, 
13
at the conclusion of his 2017 visit to the United 
14
States, the UN Special Rapporteur on extreme pov-
15
erty and human rights noted concern that low-in-
16
come women face legal and practical obstacles to ex-
17
ercising their constitutional right to access abortion 
18
services, trapping many women in cycles of poverty. 
19
Similarly, in May 2020, the UN Working Group on 
20
discrimination against women and girls, along with 
21
other human rights experts, expressed concern that 
22
some states had manipulated the COVID–19 crisis 
23
to restrict access to abortion, which the experts rec-
24
ognized as ‘‘the latest example illustrating a pattern 
25
20:44 Jul 07, 2022
H8296
12 
•HR 8296 IH
of restrictions and retrogressions in access to legal 
1
abortion care across the country’’ and reminded 
2
U.S. authorities that abortion care constitutes essen-
3
tial health care that must remain available during 
4
and after the pandemic. They noted that barriers to 
5
abortion access exacerbate systemic inequalities and 
6
cause particular harm to marginalized communities, 
7
including low-income people, people of color, immi-
8
grants, people with disabilities, and LGBTQ people. 
9
(23) Abortion-specific restrictions affect the 
10
cost and availability of abortion services, and the 
11
settings in which abortion services are delivered. 
12
People travel across State lines and otherwise en-
13
gage in interstate commerce to access this essential 
14
medical care, and more would be forced to do so ab-
15
sent this Act. Likewise, health care providers travel 
16
across State lines and otherwise engage in interstate 
17
commerce in order to provide abortion services to 
18
patients, and more would be forced to do so absent 
19
this Act. 
20
(24) Health care providers engage in a form of 
21
economic and commercial activity when they provide 
22
abortion services, and there is an interstate market 
23
for abortion services. 
24
20:44 Jul 07, 2022
H8296
13 
•HR 8296 IH
(25) Abortion restrictions substantially affect 
1
interstate commerce in numerous ways. For exam-
2
ple, to provide abortion services, health care pro-
3
viders engage in interstate commerce to purchase 
4
medicine, medical equipment, and other necessary 
5
goods and services. To provide and assist others in 
6
providing abortion services, health care providers en-
7
gage in interstate commerce to obtain and provide 
8
training. To provide abortion services, health care 
9
providers employ and obtain commercial services 
10
from doctors, nurses, and other personnel who en-
11
gage in interstate commerce and travel across State 
12
lines. 
13
(26) It is difficult and time and resource-con-
14
suming for clinics to challenge State laws that bur-
15
den or impede abortion services. Litigation that 
16
blocks one abortion restriction may not prevent a 
17
State from adopting other similarly burdensome 
18
abortion restrictions or using different methods to 
19
burden or impede abortion services. There is a his-
20
tory and pattern of States passing successive and 
21
different laws that unduly burden abortion services. 
22
(27) When a health care provider ceases pro-
23
viding abortion services as a result of burdensome 
24
and medically unnecessary regulations, it is often 
25
20:44 Jul 07, 2022
H8296
14 
•HR 8296 IH
difficult or impossible for that health care provider 
1
to recommence providing those abortion services, 
2
and difficult or impossible for other health care pro-
3
viders to provide abortion services that restore or re-
4
place the ceased abortion services. 
5
(28) Health care providers are subject to license 
6
laws in various jurisdictions, which are not affected 
7
by this Act except as provided in this Act. 
8
(29) Congress has the authority to enact this 
9
Act to protect abortion services pursuant to— 
10
(A) its powers under the commerce clause 
11
of section 8 of article I of the Constitution of 
12
the United States; 
13
(B) its powers under section 5 of the Four-
14
teenth Amendment to the Constitution of the 
15
United States to enforce the provisions of sec-
16
tion 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment; and 
17
(C) its powers under the necessary and 
18
proper clause of section 8 of Article I of the 
19
Constitution of the United States. 
20
(30) Congress has used its authority in the past 
21
to protect access to abortion services and health care 
22
providers’ ability to provide abortion services. In the 
23
early 1990s, protests and blockades at health care 
24
facilities where abortion services were provided, and 
25
20:44 Jul 07, 2022

15 
•HR 8296 IH
associated violence, increased dramatically and 
1
reached crisis level, requiring Congressional action. 
2
Congress passed the Freedom of Access to Clinic 
3
Entrances Act (Public Law 103–259; 108 Stat. 694) 
4
to address that situation and protect physical access 
5
to abortion services. 
6
(31) Congressional action is necessary to put an 
7
end to harmful restrictions, to federally protect ac-
8
cess to abortion services for everyone regardless of 
9
where they live, and to protect the ability of health 
10
care providers to provide these services in a safe and 
11
accessible manner. 
12
(b) PURPOSE.—It is the purpose of this Act— 
13
(1) to permit health care providers to provide 
14
abortion services without limitations or requirements 
15
that single out the provision of abortion services for 
16
restrictions that are more burdensome than those re-
17
strictions imposed on medically comparable proce-
18
dures, do not significantly advance reproductive 
19
health or the safety of abortion services, and make 
20
abortion services more difficult to access; 
21
(2) to promote access to abortion services and 
22
women’s ability to participate equally in the eco-
23
nomic and social life of the United States; and

(3) to invoke Congressional authority, including 
1
the powers of Congress under the commerce clause

of section 8 of article I of the Constitution of the 
3
United States, its powers under section 5 of the 
4
Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the

through (11) of subsection (a), any limitation or require-
7
ment that—

(1) Whether the limitation or requirement, in a

24
with a health care provider’s ability to provide care 
25

•HR 8296 IH
and render services, or poses a risk to the patient’s 
1
health or safety. 
2
(2) Whether the limitation or requirement is 
3
reasonably likely to delay or deter some patients in 
4
accessing abortion services. 
5
(3) Whether the limitation or requirement is 
6
reasonably likely to directly or indirectly increase the 
7
cost of providing abortion services or the cost for ob-
8
taining abortion services (including costs associated 
9
with travel, childcare, or time off work). 
10
(4) Whether the limitation or requirement is 
11
reasonably likely to have the effect of necessitating 
12
a trip to the offices of a health care provider that 
13
would not otherwise be required. 
14
(5) Whether the limitation or requirement is 
15
reasonably likely to result in a decrease in the avail-
16
ability of abortion services in a given State or geo-
17
graphic region. 
18
(6) Whether the limitation or requirement im-
19
poses penalties that are not imposed on other health 
20
care providers for comparable conduct or failure to 
21
act, or that are more severe than penalties imposed 
22
on other health care providers for comparable con-
23
duct or failure to act.

(7) The cumulative impact of the limitation or 
1
requirement combined with other new or existing 
2
limitations or requirements. 
3
(d) EXCEPTION.—To defend against a claim that a 
4
limitation or requirement violates a health care provider’s 
5
or patient’s statutory rights under subsection (b), a party 
6
must establish, by clear and convincing evidence, that— 
7
(1) the limitation or requirement significantly 
8
advances the safety of abortion services or the health 
9
of patients; and 
10
(2) the safety of abortion services or the health 
11
of patients cannot be advanced by a less restrictive 
12
alternative measure or action.
