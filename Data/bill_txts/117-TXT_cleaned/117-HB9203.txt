SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Mahsa Amini Human 
2
rights and Security Accountability Act’’ or the ‘‘MAHSA 
3
Act’’.

SEC. 2. IMPOSITION OF SANCTIONS ON IRAN’S SUPREME 
5
LEADER’S OFFICE, ITS APPOINTEES, AND ANY 
6
AFFILIATED PERSONS. 
7
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
8
(1) The Supreme Leader is an institution of the 
9
Islamic Republic of Iran. 
10
(2) The Supreme Leader holds ultimate author-
11
ity over Iran’s judiciary and security apparatus, in-
12
cluding the Ministry of Intelligence and Security, 
13
law enforcement forces under the Interior Ministry, 
14
the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), and 
15
the Basij, a nationwide volunteer paramilitary group 
16
subordinate to the IRGC, all of which have engaged 
17
in human rights abuses in Iran. Additionally the 
18
IRGC, a United States designated Foreign Terrorist 
19
Organization, which reports to the Supreme Leader, 
20
continues to perpetrate terrorism around the globe, 
21
including attempts to kill and kidnap American citi-
22
zens on United States soil. 
23
(3) The Supreme Leader appoints the head of 
24
Iran’s judiciary. International observers continue to 
25
criticize the lack of independence of Iran’s judicial 
26

system and maintained that trials disregarded inter-
1
national standards of fairness. 
2
(4) The revolutionary courts, created by Iran’s 
3
former Supreme Leader Ruhollah Khomeini, within 
4
Iran’s judiciary, are chiefly responsible for hearing 
5
cases of political offenses, operate in parallel to 
6
Iran’s criminal justice system and routinely hold 
7
grossly unfair trials without due process, handing 
8
down predetermined verdicts and rubberstamping 
9
executions for political purpose. 
10
(5) The Iranian security and law enforcement 
11
forces engage in serious human rights abuse at the 
12
behest of the Supreme Leader. 
13
(6) Iran’s President, Ebrahim Raisi, sits at the 
14
helm of the most sanctioned cabinet in Iranian his-
15
tory which includes internationally sanctioned rights 
16
violators. Raisi has supported the recent crackdown 
17
on protestors and is rights violator himself, having 
18
served on a ‘‘death commission’’ in 1988 that led to 
19
the execution of several thousand political prisoners 
20
in Iran. He most recently served as the head of 
21
Iran’s judiciary, a position appointed by Iran’s cur-
22
rent Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, and may likely 
23
be a potential candidate to replace Khamenei as 
24
Iran’s next Supreme Leader.

(7) On September 16th, 2022, 22-year-old 
1
woman, Mahsa Amini, died in the detention of the 
2
Morality Police after being beaten and detained for 
3
allegedly transgressing discriminatory dress codes 
4
for women. This tragic incident triggered wide-
5
spread, pro-women’s rights, pro-democracy protests 
6
across all of Iran’s 31 provinces, calling for the end 
7
to Iran’s theocratic regime. 
8
(8) In the course of the protests, the Iranian 
9
security forces’ violent crackdown includes mass ar-
10
rests, well documented beating of protestors, throt-
11
tling of the internet and telecommunications serv-
12
ices, and shooting protestors with live ammunition. 
13
Five weeks into the protests, Iranian security forces 
14
have reportedly killed hundreds of protestors and 
15
other civilians, including women and children, and 
16
wounded many more. 
17
(9) Iran’s Supreme Leader is the leader of the 
18
‘‘Axis of Resistance’’, which is a network of 
19
Tehran’s terror proxy and partner militias material 
20
supported by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps 
21
that targets the United States as well as its allies 
22
and partners.
