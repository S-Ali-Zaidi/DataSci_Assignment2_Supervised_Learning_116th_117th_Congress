Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) According to the Department of Health and 
3
Human Services, a nationwide public health emer-
4
gency caused by the COVID–19 pandemic began on 
5
January 27, 2020. 
6
(2) To curb the spread of the disease, State 
7
and local governments enacted necessary restrictions 
8
on businesses. 
9
(3) On June 8, 2020, the National Bureau of 
10
Economic Research announced that the United 
11
States entered into a recession in March 2020. 
12
(4) According to the Bureau of Labor Statis-
13
tics, in April 2020, the nationwide unemployment 
14
rate of 14.7 percent was the highest recorded 
15
monthly rate since the Great Depression. 
16
(5) By August 2021, the unemployment rate 
17
was down to 5.2 percent, still 1.7 percent higher 
18
than in February 2020, before the pandemic began. 
19
(6) The duration of unemployment has in-
20
creased over the course of the pandemic. 
21
(7) The percentage of unemployed individuals 
22
who have been unemployed for 27 weeks or more

(8) As of August 2021, 5.6 million people re-

demic.

6
highest rate of decline since before World War II. 
7
(10) In the initial months of the pandemic, 74 
8
percent of small employers reported revenue loss. 
9
(11) Although the economy has improved since 
10
April 2020, many indicators show the economy has 
11
not fully recovered, and in some cases, economic re-
12
covery is slowing. 
13
(12) Experts at the Centers for Disease Control 
14
and Prevention, World Health Organization, and 
15
other public health experts in the United States and 
16
around the world have identified proven measures to 
17
curb the spread of the virus that causes COVID–19, 
18
including the use of properly fitted masks and other 
19
face coverings, social distancing, and mass vaccina-
20
tion. 
21
(13) As of September 17, 2021, the Commis-
22
sioner of Food and Drugs has approved one vaccine 
23
and issued emergency use authorizations for two ad-

cantly reduce the rate of infection of COVID–19 and 
1
the risk of serious disease, hospitalization, and 
2
death. 
3
(14) The widespread use of these measures has 
4
allowed many employers, schools, and other entities 
5
to safely resume prepandemic operations. 
6
(15) Studies show that full vaccination against 
7
SARS–CoV–2 is between 85 to 95 percent effective 
8
in preventing infection and between 96 and 100 per-
9
cent effective in preventing severe, critical, or fatal 
10
disease. 
11
(16) School closures due to COVID–19 have 
12
impacted labor force participation. 
13
(17) Between February and September 2020, 
14
approximately 900,000 mothers and 300,000 fathers 
15
left the workforce. 
16
(18) One in ten working mothers quit a job due 
17
to COVID–19 and more than half reported school 
18
closures as a reason for leaving the workforce. 
19
(19) Three out of ten working mothers missed 
20
work due to school or daycare closures. 
21
(20) The Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
22

23
schools stay open and avoid outbreaks of COVID– 
24
19.
