SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Mothers and Offspring 
2
Mortality and Morbidity Awareness Act’’ or the ‘‘MOM-
3
MA’s Act’’. 
4
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
5
Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) Every year, across the United States, nearly 
7
4,000,000 women give birth, about 700 women suf-
8
fer fatal complications during pregnancy, while giv-
9
ing birth or during the postpartum period, and 
10
about 70,000 women suffer near-fatal, partum-re-
11
lated complications. 
12
(2) The maternal mortality rate is often used as 
13
a proxy to measure the overall health of a popu-
14
lation. While the infant mortality rate in the United 
15
States has reached its lowest point, the risk of death 
16
for women in the United States during pregnancy, 
17
childbirth, or the postpartum period is higher than 
18
such risk in many other high-income countries. The 
19
estimated maternal mortality rate (deaths per 
20
100,000 live births) for the 48 contiguous States 
21
and Washington, DC, increased from 14.5 percent in 
22
2000 to 17.3 in 2017. The United States is the only 
23
industrialized nation with a rising maternal mor-
24
tality rate.

(3) The National Vital Statistics System of the 
1
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has 
2
found that in 2018, there were 17.4 maternal deaths 
3
for every 100,000 live births in the United States. 
4
This ratio is more than double that of most other 
5
high-income countries. 
6
(4) It is estimated that more than 60 percent 
7
of maternal deaths in the United States are prevent-
8
able. 
9
(5) According to the Centers for Disease Con-
10
trol and Prevention, the maternal mortality rate var-
11
ies drastically for women by race and ethnicity. 
12
There are about 13 deaths per 100,000 live births 
13
for White women, 40.8 deaths per 100,000 live 
14
births for non-Hispanic Black women, and 29.7 
15
deaths per 100,000 live births for American Indian/ 
16
Alaskan Native women. While maternal mortality 
17
disparately impacts Black women, this urgent public 
18
health crisis traverses race, ethnicity, socioeconomic 
19
status, educational background, and geography. 
20
(6) In the United States, non-Hispanic Black 
21
women are about 3 times more likely to die from 
22
causes related to pregnancy and childbirth compared 
23
to non-Hispanic White women, which is one of the 
24
most disconcerting racial disparities in public health. 
25

•HR 3407 IH
This disparity widens in certain cities and States 
1
across the country. 
2
(7) According to the National Center for Health 
3
Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control and 
4
Prevention, the maternal mortality rate heightens 
5
with age, as women 40 and older die at a rate of 
6
81.9 per 100,000 births compared to 10.6 per 
7
100,000 for women under 25. This translates to 
8
women over 40 being 7.7 times more likely to die 
9
compared to their counterparts under 25 years of 
10
age. 
11
(8) The COVID–19 pandemic risks exacer-
12
bating the maternal health crisis. A recent study of 
13
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sug-
14
gests that pregnant women are at a significantly 
15
higher risk for severe outcomes, including death, 
16
from COVID–19 as compared to non-pregnant 
17
women. The COVID–19 pandemic has also de-
18
creased access to prenatal and postpartum care. 
19
(9) The findings described in paragraphs (1) 
20
through (8) are of major concern to researchers, 
21
academics, members of the business community, and 
22
providers across the obstetric continuum represented

bolism, mental health conditions (including sub-

and cerebrovascular accidents, and anesthesia com-
8
plications are the predominant medical causes of 
9
maternal-related deaths and complications. Most of 
10
these conditions are largely preventable or manage-
11
able. Even when these conditions are not prevent-
12
able, mortality and morbidity may be prevented 
13
when conditions are diagnosed and treated in a 
14
timely manner. 
15
(11) According to a study published by the 
16
Journal of Perinatal Education, doula-assisted 
17
mothers are 4 times less likely to have a low-birth-
18
weight baby, 2 times less likely to experience a birth 
19
complication involving themselves or their baby, and 
20
significantly more likely to initiate breastfeeding. 
21
Doula care has also been shown to produce cost sav-
22
ings resulting in part from reduced rates of cesarean 
23
and pre-term births.

(12) Intimate partner violence is one of the 
1
leading causes of maternal death, and women are 
2
more likely to experience intimate partner violence 
3
during pregnancy than at any other time in their 
4
lives. It is also more dangerous than pregnancy. In-
5
timate partner violence during pregnancy and 
6
postpartum crosses every demographic and has been 
7
exacerbated by the COVID–19 pandemic. 
8
(13) Oral health is an important part of 
9
perinatal health. Reducing bacteria in a woman’s 
10
mouth during pregnancy can significantly reduce her 
11
risk of developing oral diseases and spreading decay- 
12
causing bacteria to her baby. Moreover, some evi-
13
dence suggests that women with periodontal disease 
14
during pregnancy could be at greater risk for poor 
15
birth outcomes, such as preeclampsia, pre-term 
16
birth, and low-birth weight. Furthermore, a woman’s 
17
oral health during pregnancy is a good predictor of 
18
her newborn’s oral health, and since mothers can 
19
unintentionally spread oral bacteria to their babies, 
20
putting their children at higher risk for tooth decay, 
21
prevention efforts should happen even before chil-
22
dren are born, as a matter of pre-pregnancy health 
23
and prenatal care during pregnancy.

•HR 3407 IH
(14) In the United States, death reporting and 
1
analysis is a State function rather than a Federal 
2
process. States report all deaths—including mater-
3
nal deaths—on a semi-voluntary basis, without 
4
standardization across States. While the Centers for 
5
Disease Control and Prevention has the capacity and 
6
system for collecting death-related data based on 
7
death certificates, these data are not sufficiently re-
8
ported by States in an organized and standard for-
9
mat across States such that the Centers for Disease 
10
Control and Prevention is able to identify causes of 
11
maternal death and best practices for the prevention 
12
of such death. 
13
(15) Vital statistics systems often underesti-
14
mate maternal mortality and are insufficient data 
15
sources from which to derive a full scope of medical 
16
and social determinant factors contributing to ma-
17
ternal deaths, such as intimate partner violence. 
18
While the addition of pregnancy checkboxes on death 
19
certificates since 2003 have likely improved States’ 
20
abilities to identify pregnancy-related deaths, they 
21
are not generally completed by obstetric providers or 
22
persons trained to recognize pregnancy-related mor-
23
tality. Thus, these vital forms may be missing infor-
24
mation or may capture inconsistent data. Due to 
25
00:02 Jun 03, 2021
H3407
9 
•HR 3407 IH
varying maternal mortality-related analyses, lack of 
1
reliability, and granularity in data, current maternal 
2
mortality informatics do not fully encapsulate the 
3
myriad medical and socially determinant factors that 
4
contribute to such high maternal mortality rates 
5
within the United States compared to other devel-
6
oped nations. Lack of standardization of data and 
7
data sharing across States and between Federal en-
8
tities, health networks, and research institutions 
9
keep the Nation in the dark about ways to prevent 
10
maternal deaths. 
11
(16) Having reliable and valid State data ag-
12
gregated at the Federal level are critical to the Na-
13
tion’s ability to quell surges in maternal death and 
14
imperative for researchers to identify long-lasting 
15
interventions. 
16
(17) Leaders in maternal wellness highly rec-
17
ommend that maternal deaths and cases of maternal 
18
morbidity, including complications that result in 
19
chronic illness and future increased risk of death, be 
20
investigated at the State level first, and that stand-
21
ardized, streamlined, de-identified data regarding 
22
maternal deaths be sent annually to the Centers for 
23
Disease Control and Prevention. Such data stand-
24
ardization and collection would be similar in oper-

ation and effect to the National Program of Cancer

Registries of the Centers for Disease Control and 
2
Prevention and akin to the Confidential Enquiry in 
3
Maternal Deaths Programme in the United King-
4
dom. Such a maternal mortalities and morbidities 
5
registry and surveillance system would help pro-
6
viders, academicians, lawmakers, and the public to 
7
address questions concerning the types of, causes of, 
8
and best practices to thwart, maternal mortality and 
9
morbidity. 
10
(18) The United Nations’ Millennium Develop-
11
ment Goal 5a aimed to reduce by 75 percent, be-
12
tween 1990 and 2015, the maternal mortality rate, 
13
yet this metric has not been achieved. In fact, the 
14
maternal mortality rate in the United States has 
15
been estimated to have more than doubled between 
16
2000 and 2014. 
17
(19) Many States have struggled to establish or 
18
maintain Maternal Mortality Review Committees 
19
(referred to in this section as ‘‘MMRC’’). On the 
20
State level, MMRCs have lagged because States have 
21
not had the resources to mount local reviews. State- 
22
level reviews are necessary as only the State depart-
23
ments of health have the authority to request med-

ical records, autopsy reports, and police reports crit-
1
ical to the function of the MMRC. 
2
(20) The United States has no comparable, co-
3
ordinated Federal process by which to review cases 
4
of maternal mortality, systems failures, or best prac-
5
tices. Many States have active MMRCs and leverage 
6
their work to impact maternal wellness. For exam-
7
ple, the State of California has worked extensively 
8
with their State health departments, health and hos-
9
pital systems, and research collaborative organiza-
10
tions, including the California Maternal Quality Care 
11
Collaborative and the Alliance for Innovation on Ma-
12
ternal Health, to establish MMRCs, wherein such 
13
State has determined the most prevalent causes of 
14
maternal mortality and recorded and shared data 
15
with providers and researchers, who have developed 
16
and implemented safety bundles and care protocols 
17
related to preeclampsia, maternal hemorrhage, 
18
peripartum cardiomyopathy, and the like. In this 
19
way, the State of California has been able to lever-
20
age its maternal mortality review board system, gen-
21
erate data, and apply those data to effect changes 
22
in maternal care-related protocol. To date, the State 
23
of California has reduced its maternal mortality

rate, which is now comparable to the low rates of the 
1
United Kingdom. 
2
(21) Hospitals and health systems across the 
3
United States lack standardization of emergency ob-
4
stetric protocols before, during, and after delivery. 
5
Consequently, many providers are delayed in recog-
6
nizing critical signs indicating maternal distress that 
7
quickly escalate into fatal or near-fatal incidences. 
8
Moreover, any attempt to address an obstetric emer-
9
gency that does not consider both clinical and public 
10
health approaches falls woefully under the mark of 
11
excellent care delivery. State-based perinatal quality 
12
collaboratives, or entities participating in the Alli-
13
ance for Innovation on Maternal Health (AIM), have 
14
formed obstetric protocols, tool kits, and other re-
15
sources to improve system care and response as they 
16
relate to maternal complications and warning signs 
17
for such conditions as maternal hemorrhage, hyper-
18
tension, and preeclampsia. These perinatal quality 
19
collaboratives serve an important role in providing 
20
infrastructure that supports quality improvement ef-
21
forts addressing obstetric care and outcomes. State- 
22
based perinatal quality collaboratives partner with 
23
hospitals, physicians, nurses, patients, public health, 
24
and other stakeholders to provide opportunities for

collaborative learning, rapid response data, and qual-
1
ity improvement science support to achieve systems- 
2
level change. 
3
(22) The Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
4
vention reports that nearly half of all maternal 
5
deaths occur in the immediate postpartum period— 
6
the 42 days following a pregnancy—whereas more 
7
than one-third of maternal deaths occur while a per-
8
son is still pregnant. Further, 21 percent of mater-
9
nal deaths occur between 1 and 6 weeks postpartum, 
10
and 12 percent of maternal deaths occur during the 
11
remaining portion of the postpartum year. Yet, for 
12
women eligible for the Medicaid program on the 
13
basis of pregnancy, such Medicaid coverage lapses at 
14
the end of the month on which the 60th postpartum 
15
day lands. 
16
(23) The experience of serious traumatic 
17
events, such as being exposed to domestic violence, 
18
substance use disorder, or pervasive and systematic 
19
racism, can over-activate the body’s stress-response 
20
system. Known as toxic stress, the repetition of 
21
high-doses of cortisol to the brain, can harm healthy 
22
neurological development and other body systems, 
23
which can have cascading physical and mental health 
24
consequences, as documented in the Adverse Child-

hood Experiences study of the Centers for Disease 
1
Control and Prevention. 
2
(24) A growing body of evidence-based research 
3
has shown the correlation between the stress associ-
4
ated with systematic racism and one’s birthing out-
5
comes. The undue stress of sex and race discrimina-
6
tion paired with institutional racism has been dem-
7
onstrated to contribute to a higher risk of maternal 
8
mortality, irrespective of one’s gestational age, ma-
9
ternal age, socioeconomic status, educational level, 
10
or individual-level health risk factors, including pov-
11
erty, limited access to prenatal care, and poor phys-
12
ical and mental health (although these are not nomi-
13
nal factors). Black women remain the most at risk 
14
for pregnancy-associated or pregnancy-related causes 
15
of death. When it comes to preeclampsia, for exam-
16
ple, for which obesity is a risk factor, Black women 
17
of normal weight remain at a higher at risk of dying 
18
during the perinatal period compared to non-Black 
19
obese women. 
20
(25) The rising maternal mortality rate in the 
21
United States is driven predominantly by the dis-
22
proportionately high rates of Black maternal mor-
23
tality.

(26) Compared to women from other racial and 
1
ethnic demographics, Black women across the socio-
2
economic spectrum experience prolonged, unrelenting 
3
stress related to systematic racial and gender dis-
4
crimination, contributing to higher rates of maternal 
5
mortality, giving birth to low-weight babies, and ex-
6
periencing pre-term birth. Racism is a risk-factor for 
7
these aforementioned experiences. This cumulative 
8
stress, called weathering, often extends across the 
9
life course and is situated in everyday spaces where 
10
Black women establish livelihood. Systematic racism, 
11
structural barriers, lack of access to care, lack of ac-
12
cess to nutritious food, and social determinants of 
13
health exacerbate Black women’s likelihood to expe-
14
rience poor or fatal birthing outcomes, but do not 
15
fully account for the great disparity. 
16
(27) Black women are twice as likely to experi-
17
ence postpartum depression, and disproportionately 
18
higher rates of preeclampsia compared to White 
19
women. 
20
(28) Racism is deeply ingrained in United 
21
States systems, including in health care delivery sys-
22
tems between patients and providers, often resulting 
23
in disparate treatment for pain, irreverence for cul-
24
tural norms with respect to health, and dismissive-

ness. However, the provider pool is not primed with

many people of color, nor are providers (whether

maternity care clinicians or maternity care support 
3
personnel) consistently required to undergo implicit 
4
bias, cultural competency, respectful care practices, 
5
or empathy training on a consistent, on-going basis. 
6
(29) Not all people who have been pregnant or

given birth identify as being a ‘‘woman’’. The terms
