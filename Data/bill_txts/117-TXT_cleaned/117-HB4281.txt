SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Congress listed Tibet as a separate country 
3
from the People’s Republic of China in the Export- 
4
Import Bank Act Amendments of 1986. 
5
(2) The Foreign Relations Authorization Act, 
6
Fiscal Years 1992 and 1993 declares that Congress 
7
views Tibet as an ‘‘occupied country’’, and that Chi-
8
na’s control of Tibet remains illegal under inter-
9
national law. 
10
(3) The Foreign Relations Authorization Act, 
11
Fiscal Years 1992 and 1993 further establishes that 
12
‘‘it is the policy of the United States to oppose ag-
13
gression and other illegal uses of force by one coun-
14
try against the sovereignty of another as a manner 
15
of acquiring territory, and to condemn violations of 
16
international law, including the illegal occupation of 
17
one country by another’’. 
18
(4) The Foreign Relations Authorization Act, 
19
Fiscal Years 1994 and 1995 conveyed the Sense of 
20
Congress that ‘‘the United States should seek to es-
21
tablish a dialogue with those recognized by Congress 
22
as the true representatives of the Tibetan people, the 
23
Dalai Lama, his representatives and the Tibetan 
24
Government in Exile’’.

(5) On November 18, 2020, the United States 
1
House of Representatives approved without objection 
2
H. Res. 697, which ‘‘affirms the cultural and reli-
3
gious significance of the goal of genuine autonomy 
4
for the people of Tibet and the deep bond between 
5
the American and Tibetan people’’. 
6
(6) In 1951, the People’s Republic of China co-
7
erced Tibetan representatives to sign, under duress, 
8
an unlawful settlement known as the Seventeen 
9
Point Agreement. This agreement states that ‘‘the 
10
Tibetan people have the right to exercise national re-
11
gional autonomy under the unified leadership of the 
12
Central People’s Government’’ and additionally, that 
13
‘‘the central authorities will not alter the existing po-
14
litical system in Tibet’’. 
15
(7) The establishment of the independent state 
16
of Tibet predates the 1951 Seventeen Point Agree-
17
ment by many hundreds of years. 
18
(8) In rejecting the seven-decade long illegal oc-
19
cupation of Tibet by the forces of the Chinese Com-
20
munist Party, the United States of America would 
21
provide relief to a long-suffering people and reinforce 
22
its reputation as a strident defender of global human 
23
rights.

(9) It would benefit the national security of the 
1
United States to recognize Tibet, which comprises 
2
the original three Tibetan provinces of Amdo, Kham, 
3
and U–Tsang, as a separate, independent country.

12
ple’s Republic of China over the area known as 
13
Tibet, which comprises the original three Tibetan 
14
provinces of Amdo, Kham, and U–Tsang, are invalid 
15
and without merit; and

Tibetan Administration, is the only governing au-
19
thority of Tibet.
