SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Deter PRC Support 
2
to the Russian War Effort Act’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) The People’s Republic of China (in this sec-
6
tion referred to as the ‘‘PRC’’) and the Russian 
7
Federation have, in recent years, forged a closer re-
8
lationship, based largely on their shared interest in 
9
challenging the rules-based international order, in an 
10
attempt to reshape that order into one that is more 
11
welcoming to their authoritarian systems of govern-
12
ment. 
13
(2) The rhetoric of the PRC’s leaders, including 
14
Xi Jinping, who called for the unification ‘‘by force’’ 
15
of Taiwan with the People’s Republic of China, mir-
16
rors the Russian Federation’s justification for invad-
17
ing Ukraine, poses a danger to international peace 
18
and security and the agreed to status quo on Taiwan 
19
in the Three Communiques exchanged between Bei-
20
jing and Washington, and should be condemned by 
21
the international community. 
22
(3) On February 24, 2022, Russia launched an 
23
unprovoked and unjustified full-scale invasion of 
24
Ukraine, and has since killed and injured thousands 
25
of innocent Ukrainian civilians across the country.

•HR 8544 IH
(4) The PRC’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson 
1
refused to categorize Russia’s attacks as an ‘‘inva-
2
sion’’ or ‘‘war’’ and referred repeatedly to the Rus-
3
sian Federation’s statements on Ukraine, including 
4
reiterating criticisms of the North Atlantic Treaty 
5
Organization (NATO) and blaming the United 
6
States for starting the conflict. 
7
(5) In the days and weeks since Russia’s full- 
8
scale invasion of Ukraine, the Biden Administration 
9
has imposed several tranches of sanctions on Putin’s 
10
Russia. 
11
(6) On February 22, 2022, President Biden 
12
issued Executive Order 14065, which blocks prop-
13
erty of certain persons and prohibits certain trans-
14
actions with respect to continued Russian efforts to 
15
undermine the sovereignty and territorial integrity of 
16
Ukraine, and expands the scope of the national 
17
emergency declared in Executive Order 13660 of 
18
March 6, 2014, Executive Order 13661 of March 
19
16, 2014, and Executive Order 13662 of March 20, 
20
2014, and takes additional steps with respect to Ex-
21
ecutive Order 13685 of December 19, 2014, and Ex-
22
ecutive Order 13849 of September 20, 2018, finding 
23
that the Russian Federation’s purported recognition 
24
of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic (DNR) or

•HR 8544 IH
Luhansk People’s Republic (LNR) regions of 
1
Ukraine contradicts Russia’s commitments under 
2
the Minsk agreements and further threatens the 
3
peace, stability, sovereignty, and territorial integrity 
4
of Ukraine, and thereby constitutes an unusual and 
5
extraordinary threat to the national security and for-
6
eign policy of the United States. 
7
(7) On March 8, 2022, President Biden issued 
8
Executive Order 14066, which prohibits certain im-
9
ports and new investments with respect to continued 
10
Russian Federation efforts to undermine the sov-
11
ereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, and ex-
12
pands the scope of the national emergency declared 
13
in Executive Order 14024 of April 15, 2021, and 
14
takes additional steps with respect to Executive 
15
Order 14039 of August 20, 2021, finding that the 
16
Russian 
Federation’s 
unjustified, 
unprovoked, 
17
unyielding, and unconscionable war against Ukraine, 
18
including its recent further invasion in violation of 
19
international law, including the United Nations 
20
Charter, further threatens the peace, stability, sov-
21
ereignty, and territorial integrity of Ukraine, and 
22
thereby constitutes an unusual and extraordinary 
23
threat to the national security and foreign policy of 
24
the United States.

(8) On March 11, 2022, President Biden issued 
1
Executive Order 14068, which further prohibits cer-
2
tain imports and new investments with respect to 
3
continued Russian Federation efforts to undermine 
4
the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, 
5
and takes additional steps with respect to the na-
6
tional emergency declared in Executive Order 14024 
7
of April 15, 2021, and Executive Order 14039 of 
8
August 20, 2021, and expanded by Executive Order 
9
14066 of March 8, 2022. 
10
(9) On April 6, 2022, President Biden issued 
11
Executive Order 14071, prohibiting new investment 
12
and certain services to the Russian Federation in re-
13
sponse to continued Russian Federation aggression, 
14
and takes additional steps with respect to the na-
15
tional emergency declared in Executive Order 14024 
16
of April 15, 2021, expanded by Executive Order 
17
14066 of March 8, 2022, and relied on for addi-
18
tional steps taken in Executive Order 14039 of Au-
19
gust 20, 2021, and Executive Order 14068 of March 
20
11, 2022. 
21
(10) In March 2022, as the Biden Administra-
22
tion continued to increase pressure on Putin’s re-
23
gime through rollouts of the aforementioned sanc-
24
tions, the head of the PRC’s banking and insurance 
25

•HR 8544 IH
regulator said the PRC will not participate in the 
1
sanctions regime Western nations imposed on Russia 
2
and ‘‘will continue to maintain normal economic, 
3
trade and financial exchanges’’ with Russia despite 
4
its aggression against Ukraine. 
5
(11) Indeed, that same month, according to 
6
PRC customs data, Russia bought 9,950 metric tons 
7
of alumina from the PRC, which is nearly 10 times 
8
more than what it purchased in the same period a 
9
year earlier. The PRC’s first-quarter exports of alu-
10
mina to Russia are nearly six times the volume of 
11
all of 2021, suggesting the PRC may find new ways 
12
of providing support to Russia. 
13
(12) On June 28, 2022, the U.S. Department 
14
of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, 
15
added five Chinese companies to the Entity List, in 
16
response to their continued support to Russia’s mili-
17
tary efforts since the imposition of export controls in 
18
response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

sia’s intelligence and security services against the 
1
people of Ukraine should be strongly condemned; 
2
(2) any country or entity that provides material 
3
support for Russia’s invasion is furthering Russia’s 
4
unlawful belligerence and committing of war crimes; 
5
(3) Chinese Government officials and individ-
6
uals and entities associated with People’s Republic 
7
of China that assist the Russian Federation, includ-

10
providing material support or in evading sanctions 
11
imposed following the Russian Federation’s invasion 
12
of Ukraine are, in so doing, supporting the Russian 
13
Federation’s unprovoked attack on Ukraine and the 
14
Ukrainian people, including alleged war crimes com-
15
mitted by Russian Armed Forces against civilians; 
16
(4) the President should continue to seek unity 
17
with European and other key partners and to uphold 
18
sanctions that continue to impose costs on Putin’s 
19
regime and deplete the Russian Federation’s war 
20
chest; 
21
(5) the President should impose sanctions with 
22
respect to those sectors and individuals and entities 
23
of the Russian Federation, including Russian Gov-

that is similar to the provisions of this Act.
