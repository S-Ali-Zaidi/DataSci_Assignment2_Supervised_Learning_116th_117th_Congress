3
Congress finds the following: 
4
(1) Throughout our Nation’s history, national 
5
banks have played a crucial role in financing most 
6
of our Nation’s public infrastructure. The largest 
7
banks included: The First (1791–1811) and Second 
8
(1816–1836) Banks of the United States, President 
9

•HR 3339 IH
Lincoln’s national banking system, and President 
1
Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s Reconstruction Finance 
2
Corporation (1932–1957). 
3
(2) These national banks were enacted with 
4
broad bi-partisan support, and financed the con-
5
struction of: roads, turnpikes, bridges, and canals; 
6
the Transcontinental Railroad; the Hoover Dam; 
7
rural electrification; manufacturing start-ups; and 
8
rail, school, and farm improvements in every corner 
9
of our country. Investments created the conditions 
10
for improved productivity, economic growth, and job 
11
creation; helped lift us out of the Great Depression; 
12
and contributed to our victory in World War II. 
13
(3) The American Society of Civil Engineers 
14
(hereinafter referred to as ‘‘ASCE’’), in its 2021 Re-
15
port Card and Failure to Act Series, estimates that 
16
$6,109,000,000,000 is needed over the next ten 
17
years (2020–2029) to meet all of our country’s in-
18
frastructure 
needs. 
Of 
that 
amount, 
19
$3,483,000,000,000 is expected to be financed by: 
20
the Federal government through its normal budget 
21
appropriations process; and by States, counties, cit-
22
ies, utilities, and port and airport authorities 
23
through their general revenues, special taxes, user 
24
fees, and borrowing. Even with this spending, how-
25

•HR 3339 IH
ever, a financing gap of $2,626,000,000,000 re-
1
mains. To close this gap, our nation will need to in-
2
crease investment, by all levels of government, from 
3
2.5 percent to 3.5 percent of GDP by 2025. 
4
(4) 
ASCE 
estimates 
that 
the 
added 
5
$2,626,000,000,000 needed over a ten year period to 
6
bring systems up to a state of good repair is as fol-
7
lows (amounts in parentheses): 
8
(A) 
Roads, 
bridges, 
and 
transit 
9
($1,035,000,000,000). 
10
(B) Drinking water, wastewater, and 
11
stormwater systems ($801,000,000,000). 
12
(C) Schools ($250,000,000,000). 
13
(D) Electricity generation, transmission, 
14
distribution ($197,000,000,000). 
15
(E) Aviation ($111,000,000,000). 
16
(F) Dams, levees, inland waterways, and 
17
ports ($109,000,000,000). 
18
(G) Passenger rail ($45,000,000,000). 
19
(H) 
Public 
parks 
and 
recreation 
20
($78,000,000,000). 
21
(5) 
Expanded 
investment 
of 
at 
least 
22
$2,374,000,000,000 is needed for— 
23
(A) new affordable housing; a 9,000 mile 
24
high speed rail network; 
25
02:51 Jul 02, 2021

(B) affordable and complete broadband ac-
1
cess; 
2
(C) major water projects; 
3
(D) science and technology drivers; 
4
(E) to accommodate population growth 
5
and save on energy use; and 
6
(F) improvements in rural, urban, and low- 
7
income areas that the private sector is not cur-
8
rently serving. 
9
(6) Although Federal grant programs, along 
10
with matching State and local funding, should con-
11
tinue to play a coordinating role in financing infra-
12
structure in the United States, current and foresee-
13
able demands on existing Federal, State, and local 
14
budgets exceed the resources to support these pro-
15
grams by a wide margin. In addition, a severe eco-
16
nomic downturn in 2020, resulting in significant un-
17
employment, business losses, and public budget defi-
18
cits, has placed further limits on infrastructure 
19
spending. 
20
(7) The establishment of a United States public 
21
deposit money bank would provide direct loans and 
22
other financing of up to $5,000,000,000,000 for 
23
qualifying infrastructure projects without requiring 
24
additional Federal taxes or deficits. Such funding 
25
02:51 Jul 02, 2021
H3339

•HR 3339 IH
would be adequate to finance all of the United 
1
States’ unfunded infrastructure needs, in all parts of 
2
the country, according to well-developed strategic 
3
plans. At the same time, it would return the United 
4
States to its most recent ‘‘golden age’’ when a Na-
5
tional Infrastructure Bank was in place (1933– 
6
1957), during which time total factor productivity 
7
advanced by 3.5 percent per year, the economy grew 
8
on average 5.5 percent per year, income inequality 
9
fell by one-third, and Federal and State tax receipts 
10
rose dramatically.
