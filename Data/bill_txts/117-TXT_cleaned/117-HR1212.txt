RESOLUTION 
Affirming the constitutional right to travel freely and volun-
tarily within the United States, District of Columbia, 
Tribal lands, and the territories of the United States. 
Whereas the right to travel freely and voluntarily among the 
several States is one of the chief privileges and immuni-
ties guaranteed to all citizens of the United States by the 
14th Amendment and one of the fundamental rights 
guaranteed to all persons under the 14th Amendment’s 
Equal Protection Clause; 
Whereas section 5 of the 14th Amendment empowers Con-
gress to enforce, by appropriate legislation, its provisions; 
Whereas the Supreme Court has repeatedly held that ‘‘a cit-
izen of one State who travels in other States, intending 
to return home at the end of his journey, is entitled to

enjoy the ‘Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the 
several States’ that he visits’’ (Saenz v. Roe, 526 U.S. 
489, 501 (1999) (citing Corfield v. Coryell, 6 F. Cas. 546 
(No. 3,230) (C.C.E.D.Pa.1823); Edwards v. California, 
314 U.S. 160 (1941); United States v. Guest, 383 U.S. 
745 (1966))); and 
Whereas the Supreme Court long ago decided that one of the 
privileges or immunities that the Constitution guarantees 
is the ‘‘fundamental’’ right to travel from one State to 
another to seek and obtain services lawful in the latter 
State, including medical services, on terms of substantial 
equality with the residents of that State (Toomer v. 
Witsell, 334 U.S. 385, 396 (1948); Hicklin v. Orbeck, 
437 U.S. 518, 525 (1978); Doe v. Bolton, 410 U.S. 179, 
200 (1973) (citing Ward v. Maryland, 79 U.S. 418 
(1870)); Chalker v. Birmingham & N.W.R. Co., 249 U.S. 
522, 527 (1919); Shaffer v. Carter, 252 U.S. 37, 52, 53 
(1920)): Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-
