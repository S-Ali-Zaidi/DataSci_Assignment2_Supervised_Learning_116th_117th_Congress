‘‘(A) A do-not-resuscitate order or similar 
1
physician’s order shall not be instituted, either 
2
orally or in writing, unless at least one parent 
3
or legal guardian of such unemancipated minor 
4
has first been informed of the physician’s intent 
5
to institute such an order and a reasonable at-
6
tempt has been made to inform the other par-

formation must be provided both orally and in 
10
writing unless, in reasonable medical judgment, 
11
the urgency of the decision requires reliance on 
12
only providing the information orally. Oral pro-
13
vision of such information shall include speak-
14
ing to at least one parent or legal guardian in 
15
person or on the telephone, and shall not be 
16
limited to recorded voice messages. Provision of 
17
such information shall include at least 72 hours 
18

11

12
Any such refusal of consent must be contem-

the unemancipated minor. No do-not-resuscitate

been such a refusal of consent.

5
paragraph (A), a parent or legal guardian may 
6
request a transfer of the unemancipated minor 
7
patient or resident to another facility or dis-
