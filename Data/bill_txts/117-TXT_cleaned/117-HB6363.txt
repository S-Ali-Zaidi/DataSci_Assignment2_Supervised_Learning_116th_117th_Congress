1
to which the Department of Health and Human Services

(referred to in this section as the ‘‘Department’’) utilizes 
3
or provides funding to entities that utilize such funds for 
4
human genomic sequencing services or genetic services (as 
5
such term is defined in section 201(6) of the Genetic In-
6
formation Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (42 U.S.C. 
7

13
(1) consider— 
14
(A) what is known about the extent to 
15
which the country or countries of concern could 
16
obtain human genomic information of citizens 
17
and residents of the United States from such 
18
entities that sequence, analyze, collect, or store 
19
human genomic information and which the Di-
20
rector of National Intelligence or the head of 
21
another Federal department or agency reason-
22
ably anticipates may use such information in a 
23
manner inconsistent with the national security

20
necessary to complete such study, investigate specific in-
21

or genetic services, as described in subsection (a), to 
23
produce estimates of the potential prevalence of such utili-
24
zation among entities in receipt of Departmental funds.
