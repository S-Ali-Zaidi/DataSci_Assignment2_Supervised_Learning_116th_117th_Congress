SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) In the past decades it has become standard 
3
practice to publish versions of the White House and 
4
other agency websites in Spanish. 
5
(2) At least 36,000,000 United States residents 
6
who speak Spanish as their first language depend 
7
upon these websites to access important information 
8
that can play a critical role in their life. 
9
(3) In 2010, for 59,000,000 people, English 
10
was not their first language. 
11
(4) In addition to English, the top languages in 
12
the United States are Spanish, Chinese, Tagalog, 
13
Vietnamese, and French. 
14
(5) Millions of people within the United States 
15
will benefit by having websites translated into mul-
16
tiple languages. 
17
(6) The United States of America is a diverse 
18
Nation and, as such, does not have an official lan-
19
guage. 
20
(7) Since our founding, our country has been in 
21
a constant state of growth. We have consistently 
22
grown more multilingual because of people from 
23
across the world seeking a better future while car-
24
rying a hope of achieving the American dream.

(8) As this is happening, the United States 
1
must adapt and make our democracy more accessible 
2
for everyone.

SEC. 3. PURPOSE. 
4
The purpose of this Act is to— 
5

6
provide resources in multiple languages so that peo-
7
ple can read information in the language they are 
8
most comfortable with; and 
9
(2) acknowledge the diversity of our country 
10
and use creative solutions to make sure that there 
11
is equity in accessing information from our govern-
12
ment.
