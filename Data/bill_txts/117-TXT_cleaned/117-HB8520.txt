SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
1
It is the sense of Congress that— 
2
(1) the national security of the United States is 
3
affected by the telecommunications security of 
4
United States allies, partners, and other countries 
5
around the globe; 
6
(2) the importance of mobile and internet serv-
7
ices makes such services tempting and effective tools 
8
for malign influence and economic coercion; 
9
(3) Huawei Technologies Company and ZTE 
10
Corporation (and any subsidiary or affiliate of either 
11
such entity) should not serve as a vendor of tele-
12
communications equipment or services given the 
13
close ties to, and control over, such entities by the 
14
People’s Republic of China; and 
15
(4) it is in the economic and national security 
16
interests of the United States to ensure that coun-
17
tries around the globe use trusted telecommuni-
18
cations equipment or services.
