grams and provide for wider dissemination of the Youth 
Corps model. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 854 IH
(1) 
Nationally, 
there 
are 
an 
estimated 
1
5,500,000 youth, ages 16 through 24, out-of-school 
2
and out-of-work, with an additional over 500,000 
3
young people dropping out of school each year. At 
4
present, the unemployment rate for youth ages 16 
5
through 24 is approximately 17 percent. For youth 
6
who are in low-income or minority communities, or 
7
who have disabilities, this rate is significantly high-
8
er. 
9
(2) Youth Service and Conservation Corps pro-
10
grams, descended from the Civilian Conservation 
11
Corps of the 1930s, have been preparing disadvan-
12
taged and disconnected youth for careers in resource 
13
conservation, environmental restoration, land man-
14
agement, building renovation and weatherization, 
15
education, human services, health care, homeland se-
16
curity, and disaster relief for over 4 decades. To 
17
date, nearly a million young people have found a 
18
new start through a Youth Service and Conservation 
19
Corps program. 
20
(3) Today, over 125 Youth Service and Con-
21
servation Corps programs are being carried out in 
22
50 States and the District of Columbia, and employ-
23
ing a research-driven strategy, called the Youth 
24
Corps model, to reengage and provide educational

and economic opportunity to around 30,000 young 
1
people each year. These Corps members participate 
2
in 13.5 million hours of community service annually. 
3
(4) According to a recent study by the Corpora-
4
tion for National and Community Service, partici-
5
pating in service increases your likelihood of finding 
6
employment by 27 percent. When limited to individ-
7
uals living in rural areas or without a high school di-
8
ploma, the increase in likelihood of gaining employ-
9
ment jumps to 55 percent and 51 percent, respec-
10
tively. 
11
(5) Due to the many benefits and positive out-
12
comes, not only for program participants but also 
13
for the communities in which they serve, the Youth 
14
Corps model is a proven strategy for reengaging dis-
15
connected youth in education and the workforce, 
16
while improving communities and the environment.
