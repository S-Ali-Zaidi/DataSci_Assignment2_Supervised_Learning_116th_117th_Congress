SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
23
Congress finds the following: 
24
01:14 Jun 03, 2021
H1883
4 
•HR 1883 IH
(1) The Constitution gives Congress absolute 
1
power to create a uniform rule of naturalization 
2
under Article I, Section 8, Clause 4. 
3
(2) Between 2013 and 2014, the number of un-
4
accompanied children apprehended at the border in-
5
creased nearly 80 percent, from 38,759 in fiscal year 
6
2013 (October 2012–September 2013) to 68,541 in 
7
fiscal year 2014 (October 2013–September 2014). 
8
(3) The New York Times concluded that the 
9
William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection 
10
Reauthorization Act of 2008 (Public Law 110–457, 
11
hereafter ‘‘Wilberforce Act’’) enacted during the 
12
transition to the Obama administration was at the 
13
root of the calamitous flow of unaccompanied minors 
14
to the Nation’s southern border in 2014. 
15
(4) According to Cable News Network (CNN), 
16
the Wilberforce Act contributed to the surge of child 
17
migrants from Central America by preventing the 
18
United States from sending the children back with-
19
out an asylum hearing. 
20
(5) According to then-Presidential Candidate 
21
Biden, it is a ‘‘moral failing when children are 
22
locked away in overcrowded detention centers’’. 
23
(6) According to the Los Angeles Times, Presi-
24
dent Obama’s Administration, under the leadership

of Vice President Joe Biden, Homeland Security 
1
Secretary Jeh Johnson and Deputy Secretary 
2
Alejandro Mayorkas, built the overcrowded detention 
3
centers (so-called ‘‘cages’’). 
4
(7) President Biden has made the following ac-
5
tions concerning immigration: 
6
(A) Revoked President Trump’s travel ban 
7
(Executive Order 13780) and allowed visa proc-
8
essing to begin again. 
9
(B) Stopped all construction of a Southern 
10
border wall and started the process to redirect 
11
the funds appropriated for building a border 
12
wall. 
13
(C) Given Federal agencies the power to 
14
completely overhaul President Trump’s immi-
15
gration policies (Executive Order 13993). 
16
(D) Declared that Federal agents can no 
17
longer deputize local law enforcement to assist 
18
at the border when they are overwhelmed (Ex-
19
ecutive Order 13993). 
20
(E) Directed the Department of Homeland 
21
Security to preserve and fortify DACA. 
22
(F) Directed the Department of Homeland 
23
Security to expand pathways for individuals 
24
from the Northern Triangle to enter the United

States, including by chain migration, and re-
1
introduces ‘‘catch and release’’ immigration 
2
practices (Executive Order 14010). 
3
(G) Stopped President Trump’s efforts to 
4
halt immigration in order to slow the spread of 
5
COVID–19 (Executive Order 14010). 
6
(H) Targeted President Trump’s Migra-
7
tion Protection Protocols for probable recission 
8
so that asylum seekers can enter more easily 
9
(Executive Order 14010). 
10
(8) President Trump supported deporting all 
11
undocumented immigrants (‘‘inadmissible aliens’’) 
12
and called for an end to unnaturalized birthright 
13
citizenship in the United States. 
14
(9) According to the BBC, border detentions 
15
significantly increased under the Trump Administra-
16
tion. 
17
SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
18
It is the sense of Congress that: 
19
(1) The legal immigration system of the United 
20
States should be curtailed to those that can con-
21
tribute not only economically but have demonstrated 
22
respect for this Nation’s culture and rule of law. 
23
01:14 Jun 03, 2021
H1883
7 
•HR 1883 IH
(2) America’s borders must be defended, and il-
1
legal immigration must be stopped without excep-
2
tion. 
3
(3) A measure of a country’s greatness is the 
4
value recognized in being a citizen. As such, America 
5
cannot tarnish the citizenship designation by reward-
6
ing those who fail to follow the laws at the expense 
7
of those who do. 
8
(4) Amnesty must be rejected in all forms. 
9
(5) Unnaturalized birthright citizenship—which 
10
actively encourages hostile interests to undermine 
11
the legitimacy of democratic self-governance by en-
12
gaging in subversive ‘‘birth tourism’’ and chain mi-
13
gration—is contrary to the intent of the 14th 
14
Amendment to the Constitution. 
15
(6) Federally imposed refugee resettlement pro-
16
grams should be rejected due both to disruption to 
17
local communities and the corruption rampant with-
18
in these programs.
