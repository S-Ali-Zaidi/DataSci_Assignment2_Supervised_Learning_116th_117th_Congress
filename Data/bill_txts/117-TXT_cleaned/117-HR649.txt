RESOLUTION 
Supporting the goals and ideals of National HIV/AIDS and 
Aging Awareness Day. 
Whereas National HIV/AIDS and Aging Awareness Day is a 
nationwide observance that brings attention to the grow-
ing number of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) 
who are living long and full lives, to their health, and to 
their social needs; 
Whereas, more than 40 years into the epidemic, the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that in the 
United States there are more than 1,200,000 PLWHA, 
and every year approximately 40,000 people acquire HIV/ 
AIDS;

Whereas over half of PLWHA in the United States and de-
pendent areas are individuals who are someone aged 50 
or older; 
Whereas, globally, there are 5,700,000 PLWHA aged 50 and 
older; 
Whereas, in the United States, one in six of every new HIV 
diagnosis is of someone aged 50 and over; 
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention re-
ports over 100,000 PLWHA are over the age of 65 now 
in the United States, and this trend of the aging of the 
HIV population increases every year and it’s projected 
that by 2030 75 percent of PLWHA in the United States 
will be over the age of 50; 
Whereas research indicates that older Americans are more 
likely than younger Americans to be diagnosed with HIV 
late in the course of their disease progression, and are 
more likely to be diagnosed with advanced HIV or AIDS; 
Whereas the Department of Health and Human Services re-
ports that those people living with HIV/AIDS for many 
years can exhibit clinical characteristics observed in 
aging, including multiple chronic diseases or coexisting 
conditions, the use of multiple medications, changes in 
physical and cognitive abilities, and increased vulner-
ability to stressors; 
Whereas PLWHA contract comorbidities on average earlier 
in age, sometimes by as much as 15 years, and at higher 
rates by 2 to 5 times; 
Whereas comorbidities may include heart disease, kidney dis-
ease, bone disease, cancers, cognitive dysfunction, and 
mental and physical impairment or disability;

•HRES 649 IH 
Whereas recent studies report reduced life expectancy and 
greater mortality rates for older PLWHA, African Ameri-
cans, and women with HIV have higher rates of 
comorbidities and risk for mortality; and 
Whereas September 18 of each year is now recognized as Na-
tional HIV/AIDS and Aging Awareness Day: Now, there-
fore, be it

5
services, especially access to medications such as 
6
