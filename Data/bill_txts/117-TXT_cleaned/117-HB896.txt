SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
The Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Dr. Li Wenliang was a 34-year-old ophthal-
3
mologist in Wuhan, China, who died from the 2019 
4
novel coronavirus (COVID–19) after he sought to 
5
draw attention to the spread of the virus despite the 
6
Chinese government’s effort to suppress him. 
7
(2) Research indicates that the first patient in-
8
fected with COVID–19 exhibited symptoms in early 
9
December 2019, if not earlier. 
10
(3) In December 2019, Dr. Li Wenliang noti-
11
fied his colleagues in the medical community in 
12
China about the outbreak of COVID–19. 
13
(4) On January 3, 2020, after raising concerns 
14
about the spread of COVID–19, Dr. Li Wenliang 
15
and seven other doctors were detained and ques-
16
tioned by Chinese officials. Dr. Li Wenliang was 
17
forced to sign a statement retracting his warnings 
18
about the virus and confessing that he had spread 
19
illegal rumors. 
20
(5) Chinese government authorities played down 
21
dangers to the public for weeks as COVID–19 con-
22
tinued to spread, with more than 42,000 confirmed 
23
cases in China alone and at least 1,000 deaths re-
24
ported as of February 11, 2020.

(6) Dr. Li Wenliang continued to work at 
1
Wuhan Central Hospital despite his knowledge of 
2
the outbreak, and appears to have been infected 
3
himself with COVID–19 after coming in contact 
4
with a patient he was treating. 
5
(7) In February 2020, in the hospital where he 
6
worked, Dr. Li Wenliang died after contracting 
7
COVID–19. 
8
(8) Before his death, Dr. Li Wenliang stated, 
9
‘‘If the officials had disclosed information about the 
10
epidemic earlier, I think it would have been a lot 
11
better. There should be more openness and trans-
12
parency.’’. 
13
(9) The people of China expressed their grief 
14
and anger on social media after the death of Dr. Li 
15
Wenliang with the phrase ‘‘I want freedom of 
16
speech’’, which was quickly censored by the Govern-
17
ment of the People’s Republic of China. 
18
(10) The Chinese government inflicted incalcu-
19
lable damage on their own people and the rest of the 
20
world by trying to extinguish the news of the 
21
COVID–19 rather than mobilize global efforts to 
22
battle it. 
23
(11) Awarding Dr. Li Wenliang the Congres-
24
sional Gold Medal, would not only recognize his bold

actions to draw attention to the spread of COVID–

19, but call global attention to China’s lack of trans-
2
parency and censorship of speech.
