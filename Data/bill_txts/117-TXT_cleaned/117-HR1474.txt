RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the 75th anniversary of Everglades National 
Park. 
Whereas Everglades National Park celebrates its 75th anni-
versary on December 6, 2022; 
Whereas when President Harry S. Truman dedicated Ever-
glades National Park on December 6, 1947, he stated: 
‘‘Here is land, tranquil in its quiet beauty, serving not as 
the source of water, but as the last receiver of it. To its 
natural abundance we owe the spectacular plant and ani-
mal life that distinguishes this place from all others in 
our country’’;

Whereas Marjory Stoneman Douglas gave the Everglades the 
name ‘‘River of Grass’’ stating, ‘‘There are no other Ev-
erglades in the world’’; 
Whereas Everglades National Park has been designated an 
International Biosphere Reserve, a World Heritage Site, 
and a Wetland of International Importance, in recogni-
tion of its significance to all the people of the world; 
Whereas the Everglades ecosystem encompasses 3,000,000 
acres of wetlands and is the largest subtropical wilder-
ness in the United States featuring slow-moving fresh-
water that flows south from Lake Okeechobee through 
sawgrass and tree islands to the mangroves and 
seagrasses of Florida Bay; 
Whereas Everglades National Park is home to rare and en-
dangered species, such as the American crocodile, the 
Florida panther, and the West Indian manatee, and more 
than 350 species of birds, including the Great Egret, 
Wood Stork, Swallow-tailed Kite, and Roseate Spoonbill; 
Whereas the Central and South Florida region is an inter-
national center for business, agriculture, and tourism, 
with a rapidly growing population of varying demo-
graphics, all of which are dependent on a sustainable 
framework for the water resources of the region to re-
store the Everglades ecosystem, provide adequate fresh-
water supplies, and promote a healthy and sustainable 
economy and overall quality of life; 
Whereas the Everglades provides freshwater for 9,000,000 
Floridians and countless tourists each year; 
Whereas the Biscayne Aquifer is replenished by the flow of 
water through the Everglades, which provides drinking 
water to South Florida;
