Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Two-State Solution 
4
Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) In May 2021, President Joseph R. Biden 
8
stated, ‘‘the Palestinians and Israelis equally deserve 
9
to live safely and securely, and enjoy equal measures 
10
of freedom, prosperity and democracy’’. 
11
(2) The United States has, under Democratic 
12
and Republican administrations since 2002, sup-
13
ported a two-state solution. 
14
(3) On December 6, 2019, the House of Rep-
15
resentatives passed House Resolution 326 on a bi-
16
partisan basis, expressing the sense of the House of 
17
Representatives that ‘‘only the outcome of a two- 
18
state solution that enhances stability and security 
19
for Israel, Palestinians, and their neighbors can both 
20
ensure the state of Israel’s survival as a Jewish and 
21
democratic state and fulfill the legitimate aspirations 
22
of the Palestinian people for a state of their own’’ 
23
and that ‘‘a United States proposal to achieve a

just, stable, and lasting solution to the Israeli-Pales-
1
tinian conflict should expressly endorse a two-state 
2
solution as its objective and discourage steps by ei-
3
ther side that would put a peaceful end to the con-
4
flict further out of reach’’. 
5
(4) Democratic and Republican presidents have 
6
identified Israeli settlements as an obstacle to peace. 
7
President Ronald Reagan said, ‘‘further settlement 
8
activity is in no way necessary for the security of 
9
Israel and only diminishes the confidence of the 
10
Arabs that a final outcome can be freely and fairly 
11
negotiated’’. In 2003, President George W. Bush 
12
stated, ‘‘As progress is made towards peace, settle-
13
ment activity in the occupied territories must end.’’. 
14
(5) On April 21, 1978, State Department Legal 
15
Adviser Herbert J. Hansell issued a legal opinion 
16
concluding that ‘‘the establishment of the Israeli ci-
17
vilian settlements in the territories occupied by 
18
Israel is inconsistent with international law’’. Sec-
19
retary of State Mike Pompeo repudiated the 1978 
20
legal opinion on November 18, 2019. 
21
(6) During the Trump Administration, Israel 
22
accelerated its advancement of settlement plans by 
23
more than 154 percent, as compared to the prior ad-
24
ministration.

•HR 5344 IH
(7) During the final year of the Trump Admin-
1
istration, the Israeli Government demolished 273 
2
homes belonging to Palestinian families in the West 
3
Bank, the highest number of demolitions since 2016. 
4
As a result, 1,006 Palestinians, 519 of them minors, 
5
were displaced. 
6
(8) The Arms Export Control Act places nu-
7
merous conditions and restrictions on the assistance 
8
it authorizes, including a prohibition on the use of 
9
such assistance ‘‘for purposes other than those for 
10
which [it has been] furnished’’ without prior presi-
11
dential consent and a requirement that sales agree-
12
ments entered into after November 29, 1999 allow 
13
the United States to verify ‘‘credible reports’’ that 
14
assistance has been used for unauthorized purposes. 
15
The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 also places con-
16
ditions and restrictions on the aid it authorizes and 
17
mandates that international security assistance pro-
18
grams ‘‘promote and advance human rights and 
19
avoid identification of the United States, through 
20
such programs, with governments which deny to 
21
their people internationally recognized human rights 
22
and fundamental freedoms, in violation of inter-
23
national law or in contravention of the policy of the 
24
United States’’.

(9) Dating back to the administration of Presi-
1
dent Dwight D. Eisenhower, the United States has

delineated explicitly authorized uses of the aid it

provides to Israel. 
4
(10) Congress passed and President George W. 
5
Bush signed into law the Fiscal Year 2003 Emer-
6
gency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act 
7
(Public 
Law 
108–11), 
which 
authorized 
8
$9,000,000,000 in loan guarantees for Israel over 3 
9
years and $1,000,000,000 in military grants. Public 
10
Law 108–11 stated, ‘‘guarantees may be issued 
11
under this section only to support activities in the 
12
geographic areas which were subject to the adminis-

tration of the Government of Israel before June 5,

The purpose of this Act is to preserve conditions for,

and improve the likelihood of a two-state solution that se-

cures Israel’s future as a democratic state and a national

with international law;

•HR 5344 IH
(4) that settlement expansion, demolitions of 
1
Palestinian homes, revocations of residency permits, 
2
and forced evictions of Palestinian civilians by Israel 
3
impede the establishment of a Palestinian state and 
4
violate the human rights of the Palestinian people; 
5
(5) to continue to implement fully the Memo-
6
randum of Understanding between the United States 
7
and Israel signed in 2016 and to help Israel address 
8
the myriad challenges it faces, including terrorism, 
9
and threats posed by actors in the region, such as 
10
Iran; 
11
(6) that the use of United States funding pro-
12
vided through the 2016 Memorandum of Under-
13
standing by the Government of Israel for activities 
14
that put a two-state solution further out of reach, 
15
including those that expand settlements, would be 
16
detrimental to Israel’s security and inconsistent with 
17
section 2754 of title 22, United States Code, under 
18
which ‘‘Defense articles and defense services shall be

sold or leased by the United States Government 
20

4
occupied Palestinian territories, including the arrest 
5
of activists, journalists, and peaceful protesters, and 
6
to support an end to the torture or abuse of individ-
7

8
(9) that a Palestinian government that respects 
9
civil and human rights and enjoys legitimacy among 
10
the Palestinian people is both necessary in its own 
11
right and important for productive negotiations on a

two-state solution.

(2) Since 2007, the militant organization 
1
Hamas, a United States-designated terrorist organi-

ernance, recurrent conflict, and the Israeli and

Egyptian blockade that restricts the movement of

population centers, resulting in deaths of civilians in

Israel, as well as Palestinian civilians in Gaza due

to misfires.
