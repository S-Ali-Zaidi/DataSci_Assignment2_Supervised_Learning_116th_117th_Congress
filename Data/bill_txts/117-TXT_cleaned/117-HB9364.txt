SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 9364 IH
(1) By 2035, the gross domestic product of Af-
1
rican 
countries 
is 
projected 
to 
increase 
by 
2
$450,000,000,000 with the implementation of the 
3
AfCFTA and lift 30,000,000 Africans out of ex-
4
treme poverty while boosting the wages of African 
5
women and unskilled workers in particular, accord-
6
ing to World Bank estimates. 
7
(2) According to the World Bank, the total 
8
intracontinental exports from African countries 
9
would increase by 81 percent under the AfCFTA. 
10
By economic sector, the AfCFTA is expected to be 
11
especially important for expanding manufacturing, 
12
by increasing intracontinental manufacturing exports 
13
by 110 percent, which will diversify African econo-
14
mies and decrease the reliance of such economies 
15
upon extracting natural resources. 
16
(3) The AfCFTA will also increase African 
17
manufacturing exports to the rest of the world by 46 
18
percent. As a result of the AfCFTA creating new 
19
commercial opportunities and diversifying global 
20
supply chains, the rest of the world’s gross domestic 
21
product is expected to increase by $76,000,000,000.
