SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Nearly two-thirds of Americans—about 68 
3
percent—favor marijuana legalization. 
4
(2) A total of 33 States, the District of Colum-
5
bia, Puerto Rico, and Guam have legalized mari-
6
juana for medicinal use, and of those, 10 States and 
7
the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana 
8
for adult non-medicinal use. 
9
(3) Despite State legalization, marijuana re-
10
mains illegal under Federal law, listed in schedule I 
11
under the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 
12
et seq.). 
13
(4) Every day, more Americans die from over-
14
dosing on opioids. In 2016, the Centers for Disease 
15
Control and Prevention estimated that more than 
16
42,000 Americans died from opioid-related drug 
17
overdoses. President Trump has, on 2 separate occa-
18
sions, declared the opioid crisis as a public health 
19
emergency. 
20
(5) Studies suggest that increased access to 
21
marijuana is associated with reductions in opioid 
22
abuse and opioid-related deaths, among other eco-
23
nomic and social benefits: 
24
(A) A study published in the Journal of 
25
the American Medical Association (JAMA) in 
26

•HR 3043 IH
2014 that compared mortality rates between 
1
States that legalized medical marijuana versus 
2
States that have not legalized medical mari-
3
juana found that States that had legalized med-
4
ical marijuana had, on average, 20 percent 
5
fewer opioid-related overdose deaths in the first 
6
year of legalization compared to States that had 
7
not legalized marijuana. This difference wid-
8
ened in subsequent years after legalization. 
9
(B) A study published in the American 
10
Journal of Public Health in 2017 found that 
11
opioid-related deaths tended to decline after the 
12
legalization of non-medicinal marijuana for 
13
adults in the State of Colorado. This study esti-
14
mated a 6.5-percent reduction in opioid-related 
15
deaths compared to pre-legalization. 
16
(6) Due to marijuana legalization, States have 
17
generated millions in taxes and revenue and have al-
18
located these funds into public health, education, 
19
economic development, restorative justice, and job 
20
creation, such as— 
21
(A) substance use disorder treatment and 
22
drug use prevention programs; 
23
(B) school construction; 
24
(C) behavioral health programs;

(G) youth drug use prevention; 
5
(H) jail diversion; 
6
(I) mental health treatment; and 
7
(J) job creation and placement. 
8
(7) A robust and properly regulated marijuana 
9
industry wherein States are allowed to operate mari-
10
juana programs free from Federal interference 
11
stands to benefit States’ public health, education, 
12
economic, and law enforcement and judicial sectors.
