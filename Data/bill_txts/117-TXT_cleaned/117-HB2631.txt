individual health insurance coverage to provide coverage 
for such screening tests furnished to at-risk enrollees

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS. 
3
(a) SHORT TITLE.—This Act may be cited as the 
4
‘‘Amputation Reduction and Compassion Act of 2021’’ or 
5
the ‘‘ARC Act of 2021’’. 
6
(b) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following find-
7
ings: 
8
(1) Atherosclerosis occurs when blood flow is 
9
reduced because arteries become narrowed or 
10
blocked with fatty deposits. 
11
(2) Atherosclerosis is responsible for more 
12
deaths in the United States than any other condi-
13
tion, and heart attacks, resulting from clogged coro-
14
nary arteries, are the leading cause of death in 
15
America. 
16
(3) Atherosclerosis also occurs in the legs and 
17
is known as peripheral artery disease (in this sub-
18
section referred to as ‘‘PAD’’) and having PAD sig-
19
nificantly increases the risk for heart attack, stroke, 
20
amputation, and death. 
21

•HR 2631 IH
(4) While most Americans are aware of athero-
1
sclerosis in the heart, many Americans have never 
2
heard of PAD and Americans with PAD are often 
3
unaware of the serious risks of the disease. 
4
(5) An estimated 21 million Americans have 
5
PAD, and about 200,000 of them—disproportion-
6
ately minorities—suffer avoidable amputations every 
7
year as a result of such disease. 
8
(6) According to the Dartmouth Atlas, amputa-
9
tion risks for African Americans living with diabetes 
10
are as much as four times higher than the national 
11
average. 
12
(7) Data analyses have similarly found that Na-
13
tive Americans are more than twice as likely to be 
14
subjected to amputation and Hispanics are up to 75 
15
percent more likely to have an amputation. 
16
(8) Fifty-two percent of patients with an above- 
17
the-knee amputation and 33 percent of patients with 
18
a below-the-knee amputation will die within two 
19
years of their amputation. 
20
(9) Screening and arterial testing for PAD is 
21
cost-effective and should be part of routine medical 
22
care. 
23
02:06 Jun 09, 2021
H2631
4 
•HR 2631 IH
(10) Once PAD is detected, amputations and 
1
deaths can be reduced through the use of national, 
2
evidence-based PAD care guidelines. 
3
(11) Americans with a PAD diagnosis are asso-
4
ciated with a 67 percent increase in the risk of car-
5
diac death compared to people without a PAD diag-
6
nosis. Consequently, screening for PAD enables 
7
health care professionals to identify cardiac risk fac-
8
tors earlier and take proactive measures to reduce 
9
the risk of cardiac death.
