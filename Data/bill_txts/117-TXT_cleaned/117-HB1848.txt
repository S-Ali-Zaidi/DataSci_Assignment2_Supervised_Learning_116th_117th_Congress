SEC. 15001. FURTHER DEPLOYMENT OF NEXT GENERATION 
4
9–1–1. 
5
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) The 9–1–1 systems of the United States, 
7
while a model for the entire world, lack the advanced 
8
functionality, interoperability, reliability, and capa-
9
bilities that come with the adoption of new digital 
10
communications technologies. 
11
(2) 
Communications 
technologies 
currently 
12
available to the public, including first responders 
13
and other public safety personnel, have substantially 
14
outpaced the legacy communications technologies 
15
still used by most emergency communications cen-
16
ters in the 9–1–1 systems of the United States. 
17
(3) This lack of modern technology, when cou-
18
pled with other challenges, is impacting the ability of 
19
the 9–1–1 systems of the United States to efficiently 
20
and effectively provide responses to emergencies. 
21
(4) Modernizing the 9–1–1 systems of the 
22
United States to incorporate the new and evolving 
23
capabilities of broadband voice and data communica-
24
tions is essential for the safety and security of the 
25

H1848
179 
•HR 1848 IH
public, including first responders and other public 
1
safety personnel. 
2
(5) Efforts to modernize the 9–1–1 systems of 
3
the United States to date, while laudable and impor-
4
tant, have been limited due to a lack of funding and 
5
inconsistent or unclear policies related to the govern-
6
ance, deployment, and operations of Next Genera-
7
tion 9–1–1. 
8
(6) A nationwide strategy for Next Generation 
9
9–1–1 has become essential to help guide the transi-
10
tion and create a common framework for implemen-
11
tation of Next Generation 9–1–1 while preserving 
12
State, regional, and local control over the governance 
13
and technology choices of the 9–1–1 systems of the 
14
United States. 
15
(7) Accelerated implementation of Next Genera-
16
tion 9–1–1 will— 
17
(A) increase compatibility with emerging 
18
communications trends; 
19
(B) enhance the flexibility, reliability, and 
20
survivability of the 9–1–1 systems of the United 
21

22
(C) improve emergency response for the

6
(E) increase the cost effectiveness of oper-
7

(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
9
gress that— 
10
(1) the 9–1–1 professionals in the United 
11
States perform important and lifesaving work every 
12
day, and need the tools and communications tech-
13
nologies to perform the work effectively in a world 
14
with digital communications technologies; 
15
(2) the transition from the legacy communica-
16
tions technologies used in the 9–1–1 systems of the 
17
United States to Next Generation 9–1–1 is a na-
18
tional priority and a national imperative; 
19
(3) the United States should complete the tran-
20
sition described in paragraph (2) as soon as prac-
21
ticable; 
22
(4) the United States should develop a nation-
23
wide framework that facilitates cooperation among

181 
•HR 1848 IH
Federal, State, and local officials on deployment of 
1
Next Generation 9–1–1 in order to meet that goal;

3
becomes outdated in a broadband environment and 
4
9–1–1 centers are increasingly and appropriately 
5
being referred to as emergency communications cen-
6
ters; and 
7
(6) 9–1–1 authorities and emergency commu-

9
implement Next Generation 9–1–1, including re-
10
sources to support associated geographic information 
11
systems (commonly known as ‘‘GIS’’), and cyberse-
12
curity measures.

(c) STATEMENT OF POLICY.—It is the policy of the 
14
United States that— 
15
(1) Next Generation 9–1–1 should be techno-
16
logically and competitively neutral; 
17
(2) Next Generation 9–1–1 should be interoper-

able and reliable; 
19
(3) the governance and control of the 9–1–1 
20
systems of the United States, including Next Gen-
21

and local level; and
