tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
The Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) There is a unique Federal legal and political 
3
relationship between the United States and Indian 
4
tribes. 
5
(2) Indian tribes have the responsibility and au-
6
thority to provide governmental programs and serv-
7
ices to tribal citizens, develop tribal economies, and 
8
build community infrastructure to ensure that In-
9
dian reservation lands serve as livable, permanent 
10
homes. 
11
(3) The United States Constitution, U.S. Fed-
12
eral Court decisions, Executive orders, and numer-
13
ous other Federal laws and regulations recognize 
14
that Indian tribes are governments, retaining the in-
15
herent authority to tax and operate as other govern-
16
ments, including (inter alia) financing projects with 
17
government bonds and maintaining eligibility for 
18
general tax exemptions via their government status. 
19
(4) Codifying tax parity with respect to tribal 
20
governments is consistent with Federal treaties rec-
21
ognizing the sovereignty of tribal governments. 
22
(5) That Indian tribes face historic disadvan-
23
tages in accessing the underlying capital to build the 
24
necessary infrastructure for job creation, and that 
25
certain statutory restrictions on tribal governance 
26

•HR 4054 IH
further inhibit tribes’ ability to develop strong gov-
1
ernance and economies. 
2
(6) Indian tribes are sometimes excluded from 
3
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 in key provisions 
4
which results in unfair tax treatment for tribal citi-
5
zens or unequal enforcement authority for tribal en-
6
forcement agencies. 
7
(7) Congress is vested with the authority to 
8
regulate commerce with Indian tribes, and hereby 
9
exercises that authority in a manner which furthers 
10
tribal self-governance, and in doing so, further af-
11
firms the United States government-to-government 
12
relationship with Indian tribes.
