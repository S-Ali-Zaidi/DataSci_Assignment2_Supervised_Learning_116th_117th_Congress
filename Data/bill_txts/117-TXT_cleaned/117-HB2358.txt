TITLE V—DEMOCRACY 
15
RESTORATION 
16
SEC. 5001. FINDINGS. 
17
Congress makes the following findings: 
18
(1) The right to vote is the most basic constitu-
19
tive act of citizenship. Regaining the right to vote 
20
reintegrates individuals with criminal convictions 
21
into free society, helping to enhance public safety. 
22
(2) Article I, section 4, of the Constitution 
23
grants Congress ultimate supervisory power over 
24
00:03 Jun 03, 2021
H2358
127 
•HR 2358 IH
Federal elections, an authority which has repeatedly 
1
been upheld by the Supreme Court. 
2
(3) Basic constitutional principles of fairness 
3
and equal protection require an equal opportunity 
4
for citizens of the United States to vote in Federal 
5
elections. The right to vote may not be abridged or 
6
denied by the United States or by any State on ac-
7
count of race, color, gender, or previous condition of 
8
servitude. The 13th, 14th, 15th, 19th, 24th, and 
9
26th Amendments to the Constitution empower Con-
10
gress to enact measures to protect the right to vote 
11
in Federal elections. The 8th Amendment to the 
12
Constitution provides for no excessive bail to be re-
13
quired, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and 
14
unusual punishments inflicted. 
15
(4) There are 3 areas in which discrepancies in 
16
State laws regarding criminal convictions lead to un-
17
fairness in Federal elections: 
18
(A) The lack of a uniform standard for 
19
voting in Federal elections leads to an unfair 
20
disparity and unequal participation in Federal 
21
elections based solely on where a person lives. 
22
(B) Laws governing the restoration of vot-
23
ing rights after a criminal conviction vary 
24
throughout the country, and persons in some 
25
00:03 Jun 03, 2021
H2358
128 
•HR 2358 IH
States can easily regain their voting rights 
1
while in other States persons effectively lose 
2
their right to vote permanently. 
3
(C) State disenfranchisement laws dis-
4
proportionately impact racial and ethnic minori-
5
ties. 
6
(5) Two States (Maine and Vermont), the Dis-
7
trict of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto 
8
Rico do not disenfranchise individuals with criminal 
9
convictions at all, but 48 States have laws that deny 
10
convicted individuals the right to vote while they are 
11
in prison. 
12
(6) In some States disenfranchisement results 
13
from varying State laws that restrict voting while in-
14
dividuals are under the supervision of the criminal 
15
justice system or after they have completed a crimi-
16
nal sentence. In 30 States, convicted individuals may 
17
not vote while they are on parole and 27 States dis-
18
enfranchise individuals on felony probation as well. 
19
In 11 States, a conviction can result in lifetime dis-
20
enfranchisement. 
21
(7) Several States deny the right to vote to in-
22
dividuals convicted of certain misdemeanors. 
23
(8) An estimated 5,200,000 citizens of the 
24
United States, or about 1 in 44 adults in the United 
25
00:03 Jun 03, 2021
H2358
129 
•HR 2358 IH
States, currently cannot vote as a result of a felony 
1
conviction. Of the 5,200,000 citizens barred from 
2
voting, only 24 percent are in prison. By contrast, 
3
75 percent of the disenfranchised reside in their 
4
communities while on probation or parole or after 
5
having completed their sentences. Approximately 
6
2,200,000 citizens who have completed their sen-
7
tences remain disenfranchised due to restrictive 
8
State laws. In at least 6 States—Alabama, Florida, 
9
Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Virginia— 
10
more than 5 percent of the total voting-age popu-
11
lation is disenfranchised. 
12
(9) In those States that disenfranchise individ-
13
uals post-sentence, the right to vote can be regained 
14
in theory, but in practice this possibility is often 
15
granted in a non-uniform and potentially discrimina-
16
tory manner. Disenfranchised individuals must ei-
17
ther obtain a pardon or an order from the Governor 
18
or an action by the parole or pardon board, depend-
19
ing on the offense and State. Individuals convicted 
20
of a Federal offense often have additional barriers to 
21
regaining voting rights. 
22
(10) State disenfranchisement laws dispropor-
23
tionately impact racial and ethnic minorities. More 
24
than 6 percent of the African-American voting-age 
25
00:03 Jun 03, 2021
H2358
130 
•HR 2358 IH
population, or 1,800,000 African Americans, are 
1
disenfranchised. Currently, 1 of every 16 voting-age 
2
African Americans are rendered unable to vote be-
3
cause of felony disenfranchisement, which is a rate 
4
more than 3.7 times greater than non-African Amer-
5
icans. Over 6 percent of African-American adults are 
6
disenfranchised whereas only 1.7 percent of non-Af-
7
rican Americans are. In 7 States (Alabama, 16 per-
8
cent; Florida, 15 percent; Kentucky, 15 percent; 
9
Mississippi, 16 percent; Tennessee, 21 percent; Vir-
10
ginia, 16 percent; and Wyoming, 36 percent), more 
11
than 1 in 7 African Americans are unable to vote 
12
because of prior convictions, twice the national aver-
13
age for African Americans. 
14
(11) Latino citizens are disproportionately 
15
disenfranchised based upon their disproportionate 
16
representation in the criminal justice system. In re-
17
cent years, Latinos have been imprisoned at 2.5 
18
times the rate of Whites. More than 2 percent of the 
19
voting-age Latino population, or 560,000 Latinos, 
20
are disenfranchised due to a felony conviction. In 34 
21
states Latinos are disenfranchised at a higher rate 
22
than the general population. In 11 states 4 percent 
23
or more of Latino adults are disenfranchised due to 
24
a felony conviction (Alabama, 4 percent; Arizona, 7

percent; Arkansas, 4 percent; Idaho, 4 percent; 
1
Iowa, 4 percent; Kentucky, 6 percent; Minnesota, 4 
2
percent; Mississippi, 5 percent; Nebraska, 6 percent; 
3
Tennessee, 11 percent, Wyoming, 4 percent), twice 
4
the national average for Latinos. 
5
(12) Disenfranchising citizens who have been 
6
convicted of a criminal offense and who are living 
7
and working in the community serves no compelling 
8
State interest and hinders their rehabilitation and 
9
reintegration into society. 
10
(13) State disenfranchisement laws can sup-
11
press electoral participation among eligible voters by 
12
discouraging voting among family and community 
13
members of disenfranchised persons. Future elec-
14
toral participation by the children of disenfranchised 
15
parents may be impacted as well. 
16
(14) The United States is the only Western de-
17
mocracy that permits the permanent denial of voting 
18
rights for individuals with felony convictions.
