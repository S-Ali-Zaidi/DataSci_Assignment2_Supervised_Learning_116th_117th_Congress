Whereas, before this rise in hate incidents, online hate speech 
against Asians increased 2,770 percent between 2019 
and 2020; 
Whereas the use of anti-Asian rhetoric related to COVID–19, 
such as the ‘‘Chinese virus’’, ‘‘Wuhan virus’’, and ‘‘kung 
flu’’, has perpetuated anti-Asian stigma that has resulted 
in Asian Americans being harassed, assaulted, and 
scapegoated for the COVID–19 pandemic and economic 
distress in the United States;

and by extension Asian nationals, as enemies of the 
United States has further contributed to the scapegoating 
of Asian Americans and the rise in anti-Asian hate;

and existential enemy or which seeks to make all of 
China responsible for the coronavirus, contrary to advice 
from the World Health Organization, contributes to anti- 
Asian hate;

dress the rise of anti-Asian hate and improve hate crimes 
reporting, was passed with strong bipartisan support in 
both the House and Senate; and 
Whereas the people of the United States continue to remem-
ber the victims of these shootings and stand in solidarity 
with those affected by this senseless tragedy: Now, there-
fore, be it
