14
with the National Academy of Medicine (in this section

which NAM, or such other appropriate entity, agrees to 
18
conduct a study on the following: 
19
(1) The uniform screening panel review and

recommendation processes to identify factors that 
21
impact decisions to add new conditions to the uni-
22
form screening panel, to describe challenges posed 
23
by newly nominated conditions, including low-inci-

25

(2) The barriers that preclude States from add-
1
ing new uniform screening panel conditions to their 
2
State screening panels with recommendations on re-
3
sources needed to help States implement uniform 
4
screening panel recommendations.

(3) The current state of federally and privately 
6
funded newborn screening research with rec-
7
ommendations for optimizing the capacity of this re-
8
search, including piloting multiple prospective condi-
9
tions at once and addressing rare disease questions.

(4) New and emerging technologies that would 
11
permit screening for new categories of disorders, or 
12
would make current screening more effective, more 
13
efficient, or less expensive.

17
through newborn screening and improve public

health surveillance.
