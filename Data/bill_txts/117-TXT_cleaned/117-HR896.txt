RESOLUTION 
Condemning the Burmese military for perpetrating gross vio-
lations of human rights as part of its brutal campaign 
to suppress the democratic aspirations of the people of 
Burma, a year after the coup d’e´tat on February 1, 
2021. 
Whereas after a decade of promising democratic reforms in 
Burma, the Burmese military (hereinafter referred to as 
the ‘‘Tatmadaw’’) launched a coup against the civilian

government on February 1, 2021, preventing a democrat-
ically elected Parliament from being seated; 
Whereas the Tatmadaw seized control of the Government, de-
clared a national state of emergency, and unlawfully de-
tained many democratically elected officials, including 
State Councilor Aung San Suu Kyi, President Win 
Myint, and dozens of Members of Parliament affiliated 
with the National League for Democracy (NLD); 
Whereas Burma’s elections in November 2020 resulted in the 
NLD securing enough seats in Parliament to form the 
next government, notwithstanding the disenfranchisement 
of more than 1,500,000 voters, mostly from ethnic minor-
ity communities in the Kachin, Karen, Mon, Rakhine, 
Shan, and Chin states; 
Whereas, on February 1, 2021, President Biden issued a 
statement condemning the coup as a ‘‘direct assault on 
[Burma’s] transition to democracy and the rule of law’’ 
and called on the international community to come to-
gether to press the Tatmadaw to relinquish power; 
Whereas the House of Representatives adopted H. Res. 134 
on March 19, 2021, condemning the coup and calling for 
the restoration of civilian government and the release of 
detained officials; 
Whereas the people of Burma, insistent that their country 
continue along the path toward democracy, courageously 
organized a civil disobedience movement and took to the 
streets to demand that the Tatmadaw relinquish power; 
Whereas, on April 16, 2021, democratically elected Members 
of Parliament, who had been denied the opportunity to 
serve by the Tatmadaw, formed a National Unity Gov-

ernment that asserts it is the legitimate Government of 
Burma; 
Whereas the Tatmadaw has used lethal force, including 
extrajudicial executions, to violently suppress the pro-
democracy movement, killing more than 1,400 unarmed 
people since the coup began last year; 
Whereas the Tatmadaw has relied heavily on mass arrests to 
stifle dissent and has detained more than 10,700 pro-
testers, activists, and journalists since February 2021; 
Whereas the Tatmadaw has used brutal and inhumane meth-
ods to intimidate, degrade, and torture detainees; 
Whereas Tatmadaw soldiers have perpetrated rape and other 
forms of sexual violence with impunity; 
Whereas the Tatmadaw has employed digital authoritarian 
tools and tactics to silence opposition, including internet 
shutdowns, online censorship, and high-tech surveillance; 
Whereas the Tatmadaw has eroded the independence of the 
Burmese judiciary and conducted sham trials to convict 
political prisoners including State Councilor Aung San 
Suu Kyi and President Win Myint; 
Whereas the Tatmadaw continues to perpetrate a horrific 
ethnic cleansing campaign against the Rohingya Muslim 
population in Burma’s Rakhine State and has also com-
mitted atrocities against other ethnic minority commu-
nities in the Kachin, Karen, Mon, Rakhine, Shan, and 
Chin States, that the United Nations Independent Inves-
tigative Mechanism for Myanmar has indicated amount 
to crimes against humanity; 
Whereas the House of Representatives adopted H. Res. 1091 
on December 13, 2018, expressing the sense of the 
House of Representatives that the atrocities committed

against the Rohingya by the Tatmadaw constitute geno-
cide; 
Whereas the turmoil caused by the coup and the Tatmadaw’s 
violence and mismanagement of the economy have re-
sulted in a severe humanitarian crisis that, according to 
a recent United Nations report, is projected to drive 
nearly half the Burmese population into poverty this 
year; 
Whereas the deteriorating security situation in Burma fol-
lowing the coup has resulted in the internal displacement 
of nearly 300,000 people and prompted thousands more 
to flee the country as refugees; 
Whereas the Biden administration has frozen more than 
$1,000,000,000 in Burmese Government funds held in 
the United States and coordinated with the European 
Union, Canada, and the United Kingdom to impose tar-
geted sanctions against individuals and entities respon-
sible for the coup, including Min Aung Hlaing, the com-
mander in chief of the Tatmadaw; 
Whereas numerous civil society and human rights groups 
have recommended additional sanctions targeting the 
largest sources of the Tatmadaw’s foreign currency rev-
enue such as the state-controlled natural gas, mining, 
and timber entities, including the highly lucrative 
Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise; and 
Whereas the Independent Investigative Mechanism for 
Myanmar, which was established by the United Nations 
Human Rights Council to investigate the Tatmadaw’s 
crimes against humanity and compile evidence for future 
prosecutions, is crucial to ensuring accountability for
