To obtain and direct the placement in the Capitol or on 
the Capitol Grounds of a statue to honor Associate Jus-
tice of the Supreme Court of the United States Sandra 
Day O’Connor and a statue to honor Associate Justice 
of the Supreme Court of the United States Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. FINDINGS.

(a) SANDRA DAY O’CONNOR.—Congress finds the 
4
following:

•HR 4814 IH
(1) Sandra Day O’Connor was born in 1930 in 
1
El Paso, Texas, and spent her childhood on her fam-
2
ily’s isolated Arizona cattle ranch. She lived with her 
3
grandmother in El Paso during the school year, 
4
away from her home and parents. 
5
(2) O’Connor matriculated to Stanford Univer-
6
sity at the age of 16, and combined her under-
7
graduate and law school curricula, graduating with 
8
a bachelor’s degree in economics and a law degree 
9
in just 6 years. She was third in her law school 
10
class, behind William Rehnquist, her future col-
11
league on the Supreme Court of the United States 
12
(in this section referred to as the ‘‘Supreme Court’’). 
13
(3) Despite her qualifications, O’Connor could 
14
not find work as an attorney because of bias against 
15
women in the law. She ended up negotiating for an 
16
unpaid position in the San Mateo County District 
17
Attorney’s office at a shared desk, while her hus-
18
band, John, finished at Stanford Law School 1 year 
19
later. 
20
(4) O’Connor traveled to Frankfurt, Germany, 
21
in 1954 with her husband John, who had joined the 
22
United States Army Judge Advocate General’s 
23
Corps, where she was able to find work as a civilian 
24
attorney with the United States Army Quarter-

master Corps. In 1957, O’Connor returned to Ari-
1
zona and still could not find work with a traditional 
2
law firm due to her gender, so she ‘‘hung out a shin-
3
gle’’ as a sole practitioner. 
4
(5) In 1965, O’Connor was hired as an Assist-
5
ant Attorney General for the State of Arizona. 
6
(6) Active in Republican Party politics and 
7
well-received for her work at the Arizona State Cap-
8
itol, O’Connor was appointed to an Arizona State 
9
Senate seat in 1969 when the incumbent, also a 
10
woman, was appointed to a Federal position and va-
11
cated the office. 
12
(7) In 1970, O’Connor was elected to the Ari-
13
zona State Senate and served 2 consecutive terms. 
14
In 1972, she was selected as majority leader of the 
15
Arizona State Senate, the first time a woman held 
16
such a position in any State. 
17
(8) In 1974, O’Connor ran for office as a trial 
18
court judge. She won and was later appointed to the 
19
Arizona Court of Appeals in 1979. 
20
(9) On August 19, 1981, President Ronald 
21
Reagan nominated O’Connor to be an Associate Jus-
22
tice of the Supreme Court, to fill the seat vacated 
23
by Associate Justice Potter Stewart. On September 
24
21, 1981, the Senate confirmed O’Connor’s nomina-
25

•HR 4814 IH
tion by a unanimous vote, making her the first 
1
woman to serve on the Supreme Court. 
2
(10) O’Connor established herself as a prag-
3
matic, independent voice on the Supreme Court, 
4
casting decisive votes during a time when the Court 
5
was being asked to resolve politically charged issues. 
6
(11) In the 1982 case of Mississippi University 
7
for Women v. Hogan, O’Connor wrote the majority 
8
opinion holding that the State could not prevent 
9
men from enrolling in an all-women’s nursing school, 
10
writing that laws discriminating on the basis of sex 
11
would be allowed only if there was an ‘‘exceedingly 
12
persuasive justification’’ for them. 
13
(12) O’Connor sought, when possible, to find 
14
the middle ground between her often-divided col-
15
leagues, frequently joining the majority decision but 
16
presenting her views in concurring opinions that es-
17
chewed broad constitutional doctrine in favor of re-
18
solving the cases before the Court. 
19
(13) O’Connor put a very public face on the 
20
role of the Supreme Court, domestically and around 
21
the world. She became the Court’s most prolific pub-
22
lic speaker, traveling to all 50 States and to count-
23
less law schools, libraries, and public events to de-
24
scribe how the Court works and its role in our con-
25

stitutional form of government. She traveled world-
1
wide as an ambassador for the Rule of Law and the 
2
independence of judiciaries everywhere. 
3
(14) After 24 years on the Supreme Court, 
4
O’Connor announced her retirement to care for her 
5
ailing husband, who had Alzheimer’s disease. Presi-
6
dent George W. Bush nominated John Roberts, Jr. 
7
for the vacancy, but before Roberts was confirmed, 
8
Chief Justice Rehnquist passed away, creating a sec-
9
ond vacancy. President Bush personally appealed to 
10
O’Connor to remain on the Court so he could nomi-
11
nate Roberts for the Chief Justice vacancy and have 
12
more time to make a second nomination to the 
13
Court. In yet another act of public service, O’Connor 
14
agreed to serve until Samuel Alito was confirmed to 
15
fill her seat on January 31, 2006. 
16
(15) O’Connor began her retirement with 2 
17
goals. One was to convince more States to adopt 
18
merit selection of judges for filling vacancies in 
19
State courts. The second was to educate the public 
20
on the importance of an independent judiciary. Her 
21
judicial independence work led to her awareness of 
22
a national civics education deficit. 
23
(16) In 2009, O’Connor created iCivics.org to 
24
educate young Americans about civics and what it 
25

•HR 4814 IH
means to be a citizen. That endeavor grew to become 
1
the largest civics education platform in the country, 
2
with over 7,000,000 students annually enrolling in 
3
the programs. Its popularity was due to a capti-
4
vating online, interactive gaming approach. The pro-
5
gram was free to all and had no advertising. iCivics 
6
played a crucial role in Educating for American De-
7
mocracy, a federally-funded initiative to improve 
8
civics and history education, which released its re-
9
ports in March 2021.

(b) RUTH BADER GINSBURG.—Congress finds the 
11
following: 
12
(1) Ruth Bader Ginsburg was born in 1933 in 
13
Brooklyn, New York, and grew up in a low-income, 
14
working-class neighborhood. 
15
(2) Ginsburg graduated from Cornell University 
16
in 1954, finishing first in her class. Following her 
17
graduation, Ginsburg enrolled at Harvard Law 
18
School in 1956, entering into a class of 552 men 
19
and only 8 other women. 
20
(3) As a law student, Ginsburg became the first 
21
female member of the Harvard Law Review, a pres-
22
tigious legal journal. She also cared for her husband, 
23
Martin Ginsburg, who had been diagnosed with can-
24
cer, and their young daughter. Ginsburg finished her 
25

•HR 4814 IH
legal education at Columbia Law School, where she 
1
graduated first in her class in 1959. 
2
(4) Ginsburg taught at Rutgers University Law 
3
School from 1963 to 1972 and at Columbia Law 
4
School from 1972 to 1980, where she became the 
5
school’s first female tenured professor. 
6
(5) During the 1970s, Ginsburg served as the 
7
director of the Women’s Rights Project of the Amer-
8
ican Civil Liberties Union. In this position, she led 
9
the fight against gender discrimination and success-
10
fully argued 6 landmark cases before the Supreme 
11
Court. 
12
(6) Ginsburg won 5 cases on gender discrimina-
13
tion before the Supreme Court, including the case 
14
Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, which involved a portion 
15
of the Social Security Act that favored women over 
16
men, because the Act granted certain benefits to 
17
widows, but not widowers. 
18
(7) In 1980, President Jimmy Carter nomi-
19
nated Ginsburg to a seat on the United States Court 
20
of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. 
21
(8) On June 22, 1993, President Bill Clinton 
22
nominated Ginsburg to be an Associate Justice of 
23
the Supreme Court, to fill the seat vacated by Asso-
24
ciate Justice Byron White. On August 3, 1993, the 
25
22:36 Aug 09, 2021
H4814

•HR 4814 IH
Senate confirmed Ginsburg’s nomination to the Su-
1
preme Court by a 96 to 3 vote. 
2
(9) Ginsburg became the second female justice 
3
to serve on the Supreme Court, as well as the first 
4
Jewish female justice to serve on the Supreme 
5
Court. 
6
(10) As a justice, Ginsburg presented a strong 
7
voice in favor of gender equality, voting rights, the 
8
rights of workers, and the separation of church and 
9
state. 
10
(11) In 1996, Ginsburg wrote the Supreme 
11
Court’s landmark decision in United States v. Vir-
12
ginia, which held that the State-supported Virginia 
13
Military Institute could not refuse to admit women. 
14
(12) Ginsburg famously dissented in Ledbetter 
15
v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., where the plaintiff, 
16
a female worker being paid significantly less than 
17
males with her same qualifications, sued under title 
18
VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 
19
2000e et seq.), but was denied relief under a statute 
20
of limitation issue. Ginsburg broke with tradition 
21
and wrote a high colloquial version of her dissent to 
22
read from the bench. In her dissent, she also called 
23
for Congress to undo this interpretation of the law.

•HR 4814 IH
(13) Ginsburg’s impactful dissent in Ledbetter 
1
v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. led to the successful 
2
passage of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 
3
(Public Law 111–2; 123 Stat. 5), which was the 
4
first piece of legislation signed by President Barack 
5
Obama. 
6
(14) Until the 2018 term, Ginsburg had not 
7
missed a day of oral arguments, not even when she 
8
was undergoing chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer, 
9
after surgery for colon cancer, or the day after her 
10
husband passed away in 2010. 
11
(15) Ginsburg passed away on September 18, 
12
2020.
