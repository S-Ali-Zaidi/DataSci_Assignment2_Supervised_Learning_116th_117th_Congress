A BILL 
To direct the President to use authority under the Defense 
Production Act of 1950 to ensure an adequate supply 
equipment necessary for limiting the spread of COVID– 
19, to require the Director of the Defense Logistics 
Agency to establish a system for States and localities 
to access covered items during a covered emergency, 
and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Pandemic Supplies 
2
Production Act’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) The global shortage of medical and sanita-
6
tion supplies due to the COVID–19 pandemic has 
7
paralyzed health care systems and strained emer-
8
gency response capabilities of governments around 
9
the world. 
10
(2) The pandemic demonstrated the inter-
11
dependent nature and the limitations of global sup-
12
ply chains as both our Nation and the world com-
13
petes for a finite number of suppliers for critical 
14
medical and sanitation resources. 
15
(3) Providing a comprehensive understanding of 
16
how to procure, manage, deliver, and sustain at scale 
17
was necessary during this crisis, and will be critical 
18
as the United States replenishes current supplies 
19
and plans for future crises. 
20
(4) The Federal Emergency Management Agen-
21
cy and the Department of Health and Human Serv-
22
ices were challenged to rapidly identify, procure and 
23
deploy large quantities of goods and services while 
24
simultaneously responding and planning for the re-
25
22:29 May 18, 2021
H2032

•HR 2032 IH
covery of the United States from this global pan-
1
demic. 
2
(5) The traditional interagency emergency re-
3
sponse structure, built to respond to natural disas-
4
ters typically defined by geographic locales, does not 
5
have the capacity to scale quickly to address a crisis 
6
of this magnitude. 
7
(6) The Department of Defense leveraged ac-
8
quisition and supply chain expertise are uniquely 
9
suited to rapidly scale and establish acquisition 
10
strategies, for both procurement of supplies, expan-
11
sion of industrial capabilities and distribution of 
12
such supplies as the COVID–19 response require-
13
ments evolved. 
14
(7) As the combat logistics support agency for 
15
the Nation, the Defense Logistics Agency (‘‘DLA’’) 
16
manages the global supply chain—from raw mate-
17
rials to end user to disposition—for the Army, Ma-
18
rine Corps, Navy, Air Force, Space Force, Coast 
19
Guard, 11 combatant commands, other Federal 
20
agencies, and partner and allied nations. 
21
(8) DLA has supported the COVID–19 re-
22
sponse of the Department of Defense by increasing 
23
the production and acquisition of critical items 
24
22:29 May 18, 2021
H2032
4 
•HR 2032 IH
through existing large-scale contracts across multiple 
1
supply chains. 
2
(9) As a logistics integrator and acquisition and 
3
service provider, DLA has the unique capability to 
4
manage the supply chain that few other organiza-
5
tions, public or private, can match to assist States, 
6
local governments, hospitals, and health care pro-
7
viders around the country with supplies so they are 
8
not needlessly competing against one another. 
9
(10) The understanding of the reliance of the 
10
United States on foreign suppliers, often many tiers 
11
down in the supply chain, and the impact of that re-
12
liance on producing at scale, has allowed the Sec-
13
retary of Health and Human Services to better plan 
14
for replenishment of the Strategic National Stock-
15
pile. 
16
(11) DLA should provide direct support for 
17
States during the COVID–19 pandemic and future 
18
emergencies. 
19
(12) DLA can identify private sector capacity 
20
and assess additional needs for vaccines, thera-
21
peutics, tests, personal protective equipment, and 
22
supplies during the COVID–19 pandemic and during 
23
future emergencies.
