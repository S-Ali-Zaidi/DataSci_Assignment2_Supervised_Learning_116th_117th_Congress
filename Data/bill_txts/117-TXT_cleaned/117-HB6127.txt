5
‘‘(a) REQUIREMENT.—Except as provided by sub-

section (b), a funeral honors detail that presents a folded 
7
flag of the United States in connection with the death of 
8
a member of the Armed Forces or veteran under section 
9
1491 of title 10, section 2301 of title 38, or other applica-
10
ble provision of law, shall recite the following (to be known 
11
as the ‘13 Folds of Honor’) as part of such presentment: 
12
‘‘The 1st fold of the flag is a symbol of life. 
13
‘‘The 2nd fold is a symbol of the belief in eternal life. 
14
‘‘The 3rd fold is made in honor and remembrance of 
15
the veterans departing the ranks who gave a portion of 
16
their lives for the defense of the country to attain peace 
17
throughout the world. 
18
‘‘The 4th fold represents the weaker nature, for as 
19
American citizens trusting in God, it is to Him we turn 
20
in times of peace as well as in the time of war for His 
21
divine guidance. 
22
‘‘The 5th fold is a tribute to the country, for in the 
23
words of Stephen Decatur, ‘Our Country, in dealing with

other countries, may she always be right; but it is still 
1
our country, right or wrong.’ 
2
‘‘The 6th fold is for where people’s hearts lie. It is 
3
with their heart that they pledge allegiance to the flag of 
4
the United States of America, and the Republic for which 
5
it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with Liberty 
6
and Justice for all. 
7
‘‘The 7th fold is a tribute to its Armed Forces, for 
8
it is through the Armed Forces that they protect their 
9
country and their flag against all her enemies, whether 
10
they be found within or without the boundaries of their 
11
republic. 
12
‘‘The 8th fold is a tribute to the one who entered 
13
the valley of the shadow of death, that we might see the 
14
light of day. 
15
‘‘The 9th fold is a tribute to womanhood and Moth-
16
ers. For it has been through their faith, their love, loyalty, 
17
and devotion that the character of the men and women 
18
who have made this country great has been molded. 
19
‘‘The 10th fold is a tribute to the father, for he, too, 
20
has given his sons and daughters for the defense of their 
21
country since they were first born. 
22
‘‘The 11th fold represents the lower portion of the 
23
seal of King David and King Solomon and glorifies in the 
24
Hebrews eyes, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

‘‘The 12th fold represents an emblem of eternity and 
1
glorifies, in the Christians eyes, God the Father, the Son 
2
and Holy Spirit.

‘‘The 13th fold, or when the flag is completely folded, 
4
the stars are uppermost reminding them of their Nation’s 
5
motto, ‘In God We Trust.’.

a deceased member of the Armed Forces or veteran may
