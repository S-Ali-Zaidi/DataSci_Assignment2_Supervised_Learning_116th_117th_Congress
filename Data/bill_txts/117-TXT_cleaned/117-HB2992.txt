SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
3
Congress finds the following: 
4
(1) According to the Centers for Disease Con-
5
trol and Prevention, there were approximately 2.9 
6
million traumatic brain injury-related emergency de-
7
partment visits, hospitalizations, and deaths in the 
8
United States in 2014. 
9
(2) Effects of traumatic brain injury (TBI) can 
10
be short-term or long-term, and include impaired 
11
thinking or memory, movement, vision or hearing, or 
12
emotional functioning, such as personality changes 
13
or depression. 
14
(3) Currently, between 3.2 million and 5.3 mil-
15
lion persons are living with a TBI-related disability 
16
in the United States. 
17
(4) About 7 or 8 percent of Americans will ex-
18
perience post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) at 
19
some point in their lives, and about 8 million adults 
20
have PTSD during the course of a given year. 
21
(5) TBI and PTSD have been recognized as the 
22
signature injuries of the Wars in Iraq and Afghani-
23
stan.

(6) According to the Department of Defense, 
1
383,000 men and women deployed to Iraq and Af-
2
ghanistan sustained a brain injury while in the line 
3
of duty between 2000 and 2018. 
4
(7) Approximately 13.5 percent of Operations 
5
Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom veterans 
6
screen positive for PTSD, according to the Depart-
7
ment of Veteran Affairs. 
8
(8) About 12 percent of Gulf War Veterans 
9
have PTSD in a given year while about 30 percent 
10
of Vietnam Veterans have had PTSD in their life-
11
time. 
12
(9) Physical signs of TBI can include motor im-
13
pairment, dizziness or poor balance, slurred speech, 
14
impaired depth perception, or impaired verbal mem-
15
ory, while physical signs of PTSD can include agita-
16
tion, irritability, hostility, hypervigilance, self-de-
17
structive behavior, fear, severe anxiety, or mistrust. 
18
(10) Physical signs of TBI and PTSD often 
19
overlap with physical signs of alcohol or drug im-
20
pairment, which complicate a first responder’s abil-
21
ity to quickly and effectively identify an individual’s 
22
condition.
