16
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following find-
17
ings: 
18
(1) Congress has explicit and broad authority to 
19
regulate the time, place, and manner of Federal elec-
20
tions under the Elections Clause under article I, sec-
21
tion 4, clause 1 of the Constitution, including by es-
22
tablishing standards for the fair, impartial, and uni-
23
form administration of Federal elections by State 
24
and local officials. 
25
17:02 Jul 21, 2021
H4064

•HR 4064 IH
(2) The Elections Clause was understood from 
1
the framing of the Constitution to contain ‘‘words of 
2
great latitude’’, granting Congress broad power over 
3
Federal elections and a plenary right to preempt 
4
State regulation in this area. As made clear at the 
5
Constitutional Convention and the State ratification 
6
debates that followed, this grant of congressional au-
7
thority was meant to ‘‘insure free and fair elec-
8
tions’’, promote the uniform administration of Fed-
9
eral elections, and ‘‘preserve and restore to the peo-
10
ple their equal and sacred rights of election.’’. 
11
(3) In the founding debates on the Elections 
12
Clause, many delegates also argued that a broad 
13
grant of authority to Congress over Federal elections 
14
was necessary to check any ‘‘abuses that might be 
15
made of the discretionary power’’ to regulate the 
16
time, place, and manner of elections granted the 
17
States, including attempts at partisan entrenchment, 
18
malapportionment, and the exclusion of political mi-
19
norities. As the Supreme Court has recognized, the 
20
Elections Clause empowers Congress to ‘‘protect the 
21
elections on which its existence depends’’, Ex parte 
22
Yarbrough, 110 U.S. 651, 658 (1884), and ‘‘protect 
23
the citizen in the exercise of rights conferred by the 
24
Constitution of the United States essential to the

healthy organization of the government itself’’, id. at 
1
666. 
2
(4) The Elections Clause grants Congress ‘‘ple-
3
nary and paramount jurisdiction over the whole sub-
4
ject’’ of Federal elections, Ex parte Siebold, 100 
5
U.S. 371, 388 (1879), allowing Congress to imple-
6
ment ‘‘a complete code for congressional elections’’. 
7
Smiley v. Holm, 285 U.S. 355, 366 (1932). The 
8
Elections Clause, unlike, for example, the Commerce 
9
Clause, has been found to grant Congress the au-
10
thority to compel States to alter their regulations as 
11
to Federal elections, id. at 366–67, even if these al-
12
terations would impose additional costs on the 
13
States to execute or enforce. Association of Commu-
14
nity Organizations for Reform Now v. Miller, 129 
15
F.3d 833 (6th Cir. 1997). 
16
(5) The phrase ‘‘manner of holding elections’’ 
17
in the Elections Clause has been interpreted by the 
18
Supreme Court to authorize Congress to regulate all 
19
aspects of the Federal election process, including 
20
‘‘notices, registration, supervision of voting, protec-
21
tion of voters, prevention of fraud and corrupt prac-
22
tices, counting of votes, duties of inspectors and can-
23
vassers, and the making and publication of election

returns’’. Smiley v. Holm, 285 U.S. 355, 366 
1
(1932). 
2
(6) The Supreme Court has recognized the 
3
broad ‘‘substantive scope’’ of the Elections Clause 
4
and upheld Federal laws promulgated thereunder 
5
regulating redistricting, voter registration, campaign 
6
finance, primary elections, recounts, party affiliation 
7
rules, and balloting. 
8
(7) The authority of Congress under the Elec-
9
tions Clause also entails the power to ensure en-
10
forcement of its laws regulating Federal elections. 
11
‘‘[I]f Congress has the power to make regulations, it 
12
must have the power to enforce them.’’. Ex parte 
13
Siebold, 100 U.S. 371, 387 (1879). The Supreme 
14
Court has noted that there can be no question that 
15
Congress may impose additional penalties for of-
16
fenses committed by State officers in connection 
17
with Federal elections even if they differ from the 
18
penalties prescribed by State law for the same acts. 
19
Id. at 387–88. 
20
(8) The fair and impartial administration of 
21
Federal elections by State and local officials is cen-
22
tral to ‘‘the successful working of this government’’, 
23
Ex parte Yarbrough, 110 U.S. 651, 666 (1884), and 
24
17:02 Jul 21, 2021
H4064
7 
•HR 4064 IH
to ‘‘protect the act of voting . . . and the election 
1
itself from corruption or fraud’’, id. at 661–62. 
2
(9) The Elections Clause thus grants Congress 
3
the authority to ensure that the administration of 
4
Federal elections is free of political bias or discrimi-
5
nation and that election officials are insulated from 
6
political influence or other forms of coercion in dis-
7
charging their duties in connection with Federal 
8
elections. 
9
(10) In some States, oversight of local election 
10
administrators has been allocated to State Election 
11
Boards, or special commissions formed by those 
12
boards, that are appointed by the prevailing political 
13
party in a State, as opposed to nonpartisan or elect-
14
ed office holders. 
15
(11) In certain newly enacted State policies, 
16
these appointed statewide election administrators 
17
have been granted wide latitude to suspend or re-
18
move local election administrators in cases where the 
19
statewide election administrators identify whatever 
20
the State deems to be a violation. There is no re-
21
quirement that there be a finding of intent by the 
22
local election administrator to commit the violation. 
23
(12) Local election administrators across the 
24
country can be suspended or removed according to 
25
17:02 Jul 21, 2021
H4064
8 
•HR 4064 IH
different standards, potentially exposing them to dif-
1
ferent political pressures or biases that could result 
2
in uneven administration of Federal elections. 
3
(13) The Elections Clause grants Congress the 
4
ultimate authority to ensure that oversight of State 
5
and local election administrators is fair and impar-
6
tial in order to ensure equitable and uniform admin-
7
istration of Federal elections.
