SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) The Hong Kong National Security Law pro-
6
mulgated on July 1, 2020— 
7
(A) contravenes the Basic Law of the 
8
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (re-
9
ferred to in this Act as ‘‘the Basic Law’’) that 
10
provides in Article 23 that the Legislative 
11
Council of Hong Kong shall enact legislation re-
12
lated to national security; 
13
(B) violates the PRC’s commitments under 
14
international law, as defined by the Joint Dec-
15
laration; and 
16
(C) causes severe and irreparable damage 
17
to the ‘‘one country, two systems’’ principle and 
18
further erodes global confidence in the PRC’s 
19
commitment to international law. 
20
(2) On July 14, 2020, in response to the pro-
21
mulgation of the Hong Kong National Security Law, 
22
President Trump signed an Executive order on 
23
Hong Kong normalization that, among other policy 
24
actions, suspended the special treatment of Hong

Kong persons under U.S. law with respect to the 
1
issuance of immigrant and nonimmigrant visas. 
2
(3) The United States has a long and proud 
3
history as a destination for refugees and asylees flee-
4
ing persecution based on race, religion, nationality, 
5
political opinion, or membership in a particular so-
6
cial group. 
7
(4) The United States also shares deep social, 
8
cultural, and economic ties with the people of Hong 
9
Kong, including a shared commitment to democracy, 
10
to the rule of law, and to the protection of human 
11
rights. 
12
(5) The United States has sheltered, protected, 
13
and welcomed individuals who have fled authori-
14
tarian regimes, including citizens from the PRC fol-
15
lowing the violent June 4, 1989, crackdown in 
16
Tiananmen Square, deepening ties between the peo-
17
ple of the United States and those individuals seek-
18
ing to contribute to a free, open society founded on 
19
democracy, human rights, and the respect for the 
20
rule of law. 
21
(6) The United States has reaped enormous 
22
economic, cultural, and strategic benefits from wel-
23
coming successive generations of scientists, doctors, 
24
entrepreneurs, artists, intellectuals, and other free-

1
lent Islamist extremism, and other repressive 
2
ideologies, including in the cases of Nazi Germany, 
3
the Soviet Union, and Soviet-controlled Central Eu-
4
rope, Cuba, Vietnam, and Iran. 
5
(7) A major asymmetric advantage of the 
6
United States in its long-term strategic competition 
7
with the Communist Party of China is the ability of 
8
people from every country in the world, irrespective 
9
of their race, ethnicity, or religion, to immigrate to 
10
the United States and become American citizens. 
11
SEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
12
It is the policy of the United States— 
13
(1) to reaffirm the principles and objectives set 
14
forth in the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 
15
1992 (Public Law 102–383), namely that—

(A) the United States has ‘‘a strong inter-
17
est in the continued vitality, prosperity, and 
18
stability of Hong Kong’’; 
19
(B) ‘‘support for democratization is a fun-
20
damental principle of United States foreign pol-
21
icy’’ and therefore ‘‘naturally applies to United 
22
States policy toward Hong Kong’’;

4
(D) Hong Kong must remain sufficiently 
5
autonomous from the PRC to ‘‘justify treat-
6
ment under a particular law of the United 
7
States, or any provision thereof, different from 
8
that accorded the People’s Republic of China’’;

(2) to continue to support the high degree of

‘‘ultimate aim’’ of the selection of the Chief Execu-
