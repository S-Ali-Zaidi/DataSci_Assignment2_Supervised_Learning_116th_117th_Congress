strokes, as well as have increased risk for falls, injury, 
and depression; 
Whereas the majority of people with vision impairment and 
blindness are over the age of 50 years;

Whereas the overall relative reduction in employment of peo-
ple with sight loss of working age is 30 percent; 
Whereas correcting vision improves educational outcomes, in-
creases personal earnings by 5 percent, increases produc-
tivity of the working poor by more than 20 percent, im-
proves literacy rates, decreases rates of early retirement, 
and results in safer drivers and roads; 
Whereas a slight vision impairment can reduce productivity 
in the workplace by 10 percent and accuracy by 40 per-
cent; 
Whereas 50 percent of blindness and low vision in children 
can be easily prevented or treated, most often with noth-
ing more than a pair of glasses; 
Whereas globally, at least 450,000,000 children have a sight 
condition that needs treatment, with 90,000,000 children 
living with some form of sight loss; 
Whereas children with vision loss are 2 to 5 times less likely 
to be in formal education in low- and middle-income 
countries; 
Whereas glasses are one of the most effective health interven-
tions for children, reducing the odds of failing a class by 
44 percent; and 
Whereas October 13 is recognized as ‘‘World Sight Day’’:
