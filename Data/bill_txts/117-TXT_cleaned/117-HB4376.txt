A BILL 
To identify and take action against international trade prac-
tices of high income countries that unfairly exploit inno-
vation by deviating from market-based policies and un-
fairly exploit United States innovation, and for other 
purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:

•HR 4376 IH
(1) Pharmaceutical price controls in foreign 
1
markets distort global trade flows and competition 
2
by depressing the prices of innovative drugs and ex-
3
ploiting pharmaceutical innovations researched and 
4
developed in the United States. 
5
(2) By setting prices at levels that are not mar-
6
ket-based, such price controls undervalue the dis-
7
covery of new, innovative treatments, diminish op-
8
portunities and incentives for global innovation in 
9
new medicines, and threaten to restrict access to 
10
new treatments and cures for United States patients 
11
and consumers. 
12
(3) Recognizing these dynamics, it is critical 
13
that the United States use all available trade tools 
14
to address such free-riding, consistent with the nego-
15
tiating objectives set forth in the Bipartisan Con-
16
gressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 
17
2015 (19 U.S.C. 4201 et seq.), to ensure that for-
18
eign government regulatory reimbursement regimes 
19
are transparent, provide procedural fairness, are 
20
non-discriminatory, and provide full market access 
21
to United States products. 
22
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
23
gress that—

•HR 4376 IH
(1) ensuring the security of innovative and af-
1
fordable healthcare is a top priority for Americans 
2
and for Congress; 
3
(2) foreign government policies that mandate 
4
artificially low drug prices in foreign markets under-
5
mine this priority by reducing global incentives to in-
6
vest in the development of new medicines; 
7
(3) such exploitative behavior unfairly shifts the 
8
cost of developing new treatments to the United 
9
States and unduly relies on America’s patients and 
10
taxpayers to finance global pharmaceutical innova-
11
tion; and 
12
(4) safeguarding access to life-saving treat-
13
ments for American patients requires combating 
14
such behavior so that foreign countries pay their fair 
15
share of the costs associated with the development of 
16
new drugs.
