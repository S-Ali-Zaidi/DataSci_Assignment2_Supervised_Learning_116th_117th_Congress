A BILL 
To prohibit the use of funds for the research and develop-
ment, production, or deployment of the nuclear-armed 
sea-launched cruise missile and its associated nuclear 
warhead. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Nuclear SLCM Ban 
4
Act of 2021’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress makes the following findings:

•HR 1554 IH
(1) The United States nuclear arsenal com-
1
prises approximately 3,800 nuclear warheads in the 
2
active stockpile and a force structure of long-range 
3
and short-range delivery systems, including— 
4
(A) land-based intercontinental ballistic 
5
missiles; 
6
(B) submarine-launched ballistic missiles 
7
that can deliver both low-yield and higher-yield 
8
nuclear warheads; 
9
(C) long-range strategic bomber aircraft 
10
capable of carrying nuclear-armed air-launched 
11
cruise missile and nuclear gravity bombs; and 
12
(D) short-range fighter aircraft that can 
13
deliver nuclear gravity bombs. 
14
(2) In 2010, the United States retired the nu-
15
clear-armed sea-launched cruise missile, or the 
16
TLAM–N, after concluding in the 2010 Nuclear 
17
Posture Review that the capability ‘‘serve[d] a re-
18
dundant purpose in the U.S. nuclear stockpile’’. 
19
(3) Ten years later, in 2020, the United States 
20
initiated studies into a new nuclear-armed sea- 
21
launched cruise missile and associated warhead, 
22
after concluding in the 2018 Nuclear Posture Re-
23
view that the weapon system would provide a ‘‘non- 
24
22:55 Apr 17, 2021
H1554
3 
•HR 1554 IH
strategic regional presence’’ and ‘‘an assured re-
1
sponse capability’’. 
2
(4) The United States possesses an array of nu-
3
clear weapons systems, including both air- and sea- 
4
based capabilities, that provide an effective regional 
5
deterrent presence, making the nuclear-armed sea- 
6
launched cruise missile a redundant, unnecessary ca-
7
pability. 
8
(5) 
Deploying 
nuclear-armed 
sea-launched 
9
cruise missiles on attack submarines or surface ships 
10
risks detracting from the core military missions of 
11
such submarines and ships, such as tracking enemy 
12
submarines, protecting United States carrier groups, 
13
and conducting conventional strikes on priority land 
14
targets. 
15
(6) 
Stationing 
nuclear-armed 
sea-launched 
16
cruise missiles on such submarines or ships also 
17
risks complicating port visits and joint operations 
18
with some allies and partners of the United States, 
19
which in turn would reduce the operational effective-
20
ness of such submarines and ships and the deterrent 
21
value of deployed nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise 
22
missiles. 
23
(7) A January 2019 analysis of the Congres-
24
sional Budget Office estimated that the projected 
25
22:55 Apr 17, 2021
H1554
4 
•HR 1554 IH
costs of the nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise mis-
1
sile program from 2019 to 2028 would total 
2
$9,000,000,000, adding additional costs and re-
3
source requirements to the United States nuclear 
4
modernization program and increasing pressure on 
5
the Navy budget as the service plans for increases 
6
in shipbuilding while funding the Columbia-class 
7
submarine program. 
8
(8) The cost of this new program will be larger, 
9
as this estimate did not account for costs related to 
10
integrating nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise mis-
11
siles on attack submarines or surface ships, nuclear 
12
weapons-specific training for Navy personnel, or 
13
storage and security for nuclear warheads.

None of the funds authorized to be appropriated or 
20
otherwise made available for fiscal year 2022 or any fiscal 
21
year thereafter for the Department of Defense or the De-
22
