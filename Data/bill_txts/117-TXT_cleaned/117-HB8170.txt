A BILL 
To require elementary schools and secondary schools that 
receive Federal funds to obtain parental consent before 
facilitating a child’s gender transition in any form, and 
for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Empower Parents to 
4
Protect Their Kids Act of 2022’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 8170 IH
(1) School districts across the country are vio-
1
lating parental and familial rights by encouraging or 
2
instructing staff to deceive or withhold information 
3
from parents if their child expresses confusion about 
4
their gender and is seeking to ‘‘transition’’. Without 
5
parental knowledge or consent, schools are facili-
6
tating ‘‘social gender transitions’’ by changing the 
7
names and pronouns of children in school, or even 
8
allowing children to change which sex-segregated fa-
9
cilities they use, such as rest rooms, locker rooms, 
10
and dormitories or other housing for overnight field 
11
trips. 
12
(2) Powerful teachers unions and activist orga-
13
nizations are pressuring more schools to adopt poli-
14
cies to enable and encourage children, of any age, to 
15
change their ‘‘gender identity’’ at school without pa-
16
rental notice or consent. 
17
(3) Contrary to the unfounded assertions of ac-
18
tivists, ‘‘socially transitioning’’ a child is not an evi-
19
dence-based practice and it is not a neutral or 
20
uncontroversial decision. This practice is an experi-
21
mental social and psychological intervention that has 
22
immediate effects on a child’s psychology and a high 
23
likelihood of changing the life path of a child. A ‘‘so-
24
cial gender transition’’ may make it more difficult 
25
18:36 Jul 01, 2022

•HR 8170 IH
for a child to reverse course later on, thereby in-
1
creasing the likelihood that the child will continue on 
2
to a ‘‘medical transition’’, resulting in life-changing, 
3
irreversible consequences. 
4
(4) Any policies that attempt to circumvent pa-
5
rental authority are a violation of parents’ constitu-
6
tionally protected rights to direct the care, custody, 
7
and upbringing of their children as recognized by 
8
the Supreme Court. Further, policies that withhold 
9
information from parents or ask children about inti-
10
mate details of their family life violate Federal stat-
11
utes designed to uphold a parent’s rights and duties 
12
in education. School districts implementing such 
13
policies are misrepresenting or entirely ignoring 
14
these statutes and constitutional protections. 
15
(5) Schools should never be allowed to intrude 
16
on family life by misleading or excluding parents 
17
and confusing children.

19
(a) IN GENERAL.—No Federal funds shall be made

reached 18 years of age, complies with each of the fol-
24
lowing requirements:

•HR 8170 IH
(1) School employees do not proceed with any 
1
accommodation intended to affirm a student’s pur-
2
ported ‘‘gender identity’’, where the student’s pur-
3
ported ‘‘gender identity’’ is incongruous with the 
4
student’s biological sex, or any action to facilitate a 
5
‘‘gender transition’’, including referral or rec-
6
ommendation to any third-party medical provider, 
7
unless the employees have received express parental 
8
consent to do so. 
9
(2) School employees do not facilitate, encour-
10
age, or coerce students to withhold information from 
11
their parents regarding the student’s ‘‘gender transi-
12
tion’’ or the student’s purported ‘‘gender identity’’, 
13
where the student’s purported ‘‘gender identity’’ is 
14
incongruous with the student’s biological sex. 
15
(3) School employees do not withhold or hide 
16
information from parents about a student’s desired 
17
‘‘gender transition’’ or a student’s purported ‘‘gen-

identity’’ is incongruous with the student’s biological 
20
sex. 
21
(4) School employees do not encourage, pres-
22
sure, or coerce the parents of students, or students

24
vention to affirm the student’s purported ‘‘gender

7
event that the school employee knows or has a rea-
8
sonable suspicion that the student is at risk of phys-
9
ical abuse, as defined in section 1169 of title 18, 
10
United States Code; or 
11

12
volved in a child’s actions or discussions about gen-
13
der transition, without the due process of law. 
14
(c) ENSURING COMPLIANCE.—The head of each Fed-
15
eral agency shall require each application for Federal as-
16
sistance submitted by a State educational agency or local

19
school and secondary school served by the State edu-
20
cational agency or local educational agency proposes 
21
to take to ensure compliance with the requirements 
22
under this section and how these steps preserve and 
23
protect the authority of the family; and
