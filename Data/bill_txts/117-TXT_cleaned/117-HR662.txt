RESOLUTION 
Honoring the victims resulting from hate crimes, Islamo-
phobia and anti-immigrant sentiment, in the aftermath 
of September 11, 2001, where individuals were targeted 
by violence and hatred because they were Muslim or 
perceived to be Muslim. 
Whereas Arab, South Asian, Sikh, and Muslim-American 
communities have been the targets of numerous hate 
crimes over the past two decades since the events of Sep-
tember 11, 2001;

•HRES 662 IH 
Whereas Islamophobia has been a growing threat to commu-
nities and is on the rise since the events of September 
11, 2001; 
Whereas the use of Islamophobic language has resulted in 
Muslim Americans or those who were perceived to be 
Muslim being harassed, assaulted, and scapegoated for 
many forms of terrorism; 
Whereas Islamophobia is actively being spread by a network 
of closely connected and well-funded organizations and 
activists that seek to propagate misinformation about 
Arabs, Islam, and American Muslims and provide support 
for legislation that curtails the rights of religious minori-
ties; 
Whereas the Muslim population in the United States is esti-
mated at around 3,500,000 and is made up of diverse 
ethnic members; 
Whereas the Arab population in the United States is esti-
mated at around 3,500,000, and that community is made 
up of diverse religious beliefs and countries of national 
origin; 
Whereas, though many people may identify Muslims as being 
Arab, close to two-thirds of the Arab population is Chris-
tian; 
Whereas the Muslim community is incredibly diverse and not 
limited to Arabs, but also Middle East and North Afri-
cans, Afrasians, African Americans, South Asians, Turks, 
Iranians, Bosnians, Malays, Indonesians, Nigerians, So-
malis, Liberians, Kenyans, and Senegalese, among oth-
ers; 
Whereas the Federal Bureau of Investigation (in this resolu-
tion referred to as the ‘‘FBI’’) identifies hate crime as 
01:35 Sep 21, 2021

•HRES 662 IH 
‘‘traditional offense like murder, arson, or vandalism with 
an added element of bias’’; 
Whereas, during the past year, race has been cited as the pri-
mary reason for discrimination, making up over 90 per-
cent of incidents; 
Whereas the war on terror in response to the September 11, 
2001, attacks has increased instances of Islamophobia 
and hate crimes committed against Muslims, or those 
thought to be Muslim; 
Whereas, in 2001, reported FBI data showed there were 481 
incidents made up of 546 offenses having 554 victims of 
crimes motivated by bias toward the Islam or committed 
against those perceived to be Muslim; 
Whereas, from 2001 to 2019, reported FBI data show there 
were 3,489 incidents made up of 4,058 offenses having 
4,234 victims of crimes motivated by bias toward the 
Islam or committed against those perceived to be Muslim; 
Whereas hate crimes touch not only the individual victim, but 
they also affect the entire group associated with the par-
ticular bias motivation; 
Whereas unfair and inaccurate stereotyping can make victims 
of all who share the same race, religion, ethnicity, na-
tional origin, sexual orientation, or disability; 
Whereas there remains much to be done to ensure that Mus-
lims or those who are perceived to be Muslim are not un-
fairly targeted in the United States and have access to 
resources and a voice in the government; 
Whereas the rise of hate speech in the media contributes to-
ward creating social bias against a sector of society, 
which fuels the ignorance that can drive certain individ-
uals toward acts of hatred and violence;

•HRES 662 IH 
Whereas hate crimes harm not only the victim or victims, but 
also traumatize entire communities and damage public 
confidence in their safety; 
Whereas the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee 
documented over 700 violent incidents targeting Arab 
Americans in the first nine weeks following the Sep-
tember 11, 2001, terrorist attacks; 
Whereas Balbir Singh Sodhi, a Sikh, was gunned down in 
Mesa, Arizona, on September 15, 2001; 
Whereas Waqar Hasan was murdered in Dallas, Texas, on 
September 15, 2001; 
Whereas Adel Karas, an Egyptian Coptic Christian, was mur-
dered in San Gabriel, California, on September 15, 2001; 
Whereas Ali Almansoop was murdered in Lincoln Park, 
Michigan, on September 17, 2001; 
Whereas Abdo Ali Ahmed was murdered in Reedly, Cali-
fornia, on September 29, 2001; 
Whereas Vasudev Patel, a Hindu, was murdered in Dallas, 
Texas, on October 4, 2001; 
Whereas Abdullah Nimer was murdered in Los Angeles, Cali-
fornia, on October 13, 2001; 
Whereas Ali W. Ali was murdered in Minneapolis, Minnesota, 
on October 15, 2001; and 
Whereas Ramez Younan was murdered in Los Angeles, Cali-
