A BILL 
To provide for a coordinated Federal research initiative to 
ensure continued United States leadership in engineering 
biology. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Bioeconomy Research

and Development Act of 2021’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
The Congress makes the following findings:

•HR 4521 IH
(1) Cellular and molecular processes may be 
1
used, mimicked, or redesigned to develop new prod-
2
ucts, processes, and systems that improve societal 
3
well-being, strengthen national security, and con-
4
tribute to the economy. 
5
(2) Engineering biology relies on a workforce 
6
with a diverse and unique set of skills combining the 
7
biological, 
physical, 
chemical, 
and 
information 
8
sciences and engineering. 
9
(3) Long-term research and development is nec-
10
essary to create breakthroughs in engineering biol-
11
ogy. Such research and development requires govern-
12
ment investment as many of the benefits are too dis-
13
tant or uncertain for industry to support alone. 
14
(4) Research is necessary to inform evidence- 
15
based governance of engineering biology and to sup-
16
port the growth of the engineering biology industry. 
17
(5) The Federal Government has an obligation 
18
to ensure that ethical, legal, environmental, safety, 
19
security, and societal implications of its science and 
20
technology research and investment follows policies 
21
of responsible innovation and fosters public trans-
22
parency. 
23
(6) The Federal Government can play an im-
24
portant role by facilitating the development of tools 
25

and technologies to further advance engineering biol-
1
ogy, including user facilities, by facilitating public- 
2
private partnerships, by supporting risk research, 
3
and by facilitating the commercial application in the 
4
United States of research funded by the Federal 
5
Government. 
6
(7) The United States led the development of 
7
the science and engineering techniques that created 
8
the field of engineering biology, but due to increas-
9
ing international competition, the United States is 
10
at risk of losing its competitive advantage if it does 
11
not strategically invest the necessary resources. 
12
(8) A National Engineering Biology Initiative 
13
can serve to establish new research directions and 
14
technology goals, improve interagency coordination 
15
and planning processes, drive technology transfer to 
16
the private sector, and help ensure optimal returns 
17
on the Federal investment.
