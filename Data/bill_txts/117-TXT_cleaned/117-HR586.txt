RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the United States Government to 
be a guaranteed buyer of vaccines and for the United 
States to develop a ‘‘Marshall Plan’’ for global vaccina-
tions. 
Whereas, as the United States recovery from COVID–19 ac-
celerates, the United States has an opportunity and a re-
sponsibility to provide global leadership in both vaccine 
procurement and delivery in the battle against the pan-
demic; 
Whereas the American Rescue Plan provided $11.5 billion to 
support a global COVID–19 response, including $750

million for global health activities to aid our global part-
ners with health security, disease detection and response, 
and immunization; 
Whereas the Biden administration has committed to donating 
millions of vaccines to partners across the world and 
pledged to work with COVID–19 Vaccines Global Access, 
or COVAX, and other partners to ensure these doses are 
delivered fairly; 
Whereas United States diplomatic leadership led to the com-
mitment of an additional 870 million doses of COVID– 
19 vaccines at the G7 summit, to ensure fair global ac-
cess and pave the way to global recovery to address the 
secondary impacts of the pandemic including routine 
health service disruption, interrupted education, and ex-
acerbated inequalities; 
Whereas expanding vaccine production and assuring safe and 
widespread distribution will give the United States great-
er leverage in vaccine diplomacy and act as a counter-
weight to the role being sought by China and Russia; 
Whereas just as the Marshall Plan aided in Europe’s recovery 
from the devastation of World War II, the commitment 
of United States vaccine resources can save countless 
lives and contribute to the recovery of global economies 
by leading a global vaccination initiative to beat back the 
pandemic and build response capacity for the future; 
Whereas a global population of over 7 billion people, many 
in low- and middle-income nations, and the likelihood of 
each of these 7 billion needing 2 to 4 doses of vaccine, 
both initially and as booster shots, will require the pro-
duction of more than 12 billion doses immediately;

Whereas administering vaccines safely and efficiently using 
multidose vials and separate syringes in nations with lim-
ited medical infrastructure and isolated populations pre-
sents significant logistical challenges; 
Whereas these delays can, and have already, led to the emer-
gence of more dangerous and highly contagious variants 
of the disease; 
Whereas these immunizations cannot be administered without 
health care workers, all of whom must be prioritized in 
order to ensure those who are ill have medical profes-
sionals who are healthy and able to provide the necessary 
care; 
Whereas the United States should increase direct investments 
in the full vaccine manufacturing supply chain through 
public-private partnerships that will create jobs, leverage 
vaccine diplomacy, support the biomanufacturing indus-
try, and enable the world to be better prepared for future 
pandemics; 
Whereas investment in the full supply chain, including fill 
and finish capacity, will allow the United States also to 
lead in addressing a major cause of health care-associ-
ated injury and death; and 
Whereas the United States has a responsibility to lead the 
world in COVID–19 immunization: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—

health of all persons;
