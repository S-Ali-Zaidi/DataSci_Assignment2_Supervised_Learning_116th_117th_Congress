SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
The Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) In 2018, according to the Department of 
3
Agriculture, 37,200,000 individuals in the United 
4
States (including 11,100,000 children) lived in food 
5
insecure households. That equals 1 in 9 individuals 
6
and 1 in 7 children. 
7
(2) In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, 
8
food insecurity in the United States soared, with the 
9
Census Household Pulse Survey finding that at least 
10
22 percent of Americans, and 28 percent of children 
11
in the United States, suffered from food insecurity 
12
in the height of the pandemic. 
13
(3) In 2018, according to the Bureau of the 
14
Census, 
34,000,000 
individuals 
(including 
15
10,500,000 children) lived below the Federal poverty 
16
line. The majority of these individuals living in pov-
17
erty were working people, children, older individuals, 
18
and individuals with disabilities. 
19
(4) Many low-income individuals work multiple 
20
jobs and, contrary to common misconceptions, if un-
21
employed, they spend a great deal of time looking 
22
for work. They often travel by public transportation, 
23
laboriously making multiple connections to shuttle 
24
between home, work, social service agencies, houses 
25
of worship, and grocery stores. For those living in 
26
03:45 Jun 02, 2021
H2336
3 
•HR 2336 IH
rural and suburban areas far from work and without 
1
adequate public transportation they rely upon vehi-
2
cles to get to work, but these are often less reliable 
3
secondhand vehicles, that often break down. From 
4
traveling greater distances between available jobs 
5
and livable areas with affordable housing options, 
6
seeking out scarce childcare options that fit a tight 
7
budget and a constrained travel schedule, and caring 
8
for elderly parents or grandparents because a senior 
9
living facility is not financially realistic, low-income 
10
individuals have little spare time. 
11
(5) While government safety net programs help 
12
tens of million of individuals avoid starvation, home-
13
lessness, and other outcomes even more dreadful 
14
than everyday poverty, there are significant obstacles 
15
that those seeking and maintaining government as-
16
sistance face for as long as they are eligible. Quali-
17
fied applicants are often required to travel signifi-
18
cant distances to multiple government offices, pre-
19
paring and submitting piles of nearly identical pa-
20
perwork to access the different government assist-
21
ance programs. Even when the application process 
22
begins online, the eligible applicant is typically still 
23
required to physically follow up with each govern-
24
ment office with physical copies, for near identical 
25
03:45 Jun 02, 2021
H2336

•HR 2336 IH
meetings. As a result, many low-income people are 
1
actually unaware of all the government benefits for 
2
which they are eligible, reducing the amount of help 
3
going to individuals in need by tens of billions of 
4
dollars every year. The lines in these offices can 
5
seem endless, and sometimes clients need to wait 
6
outside, for hours, in the worst kinds of weather. 
7
Many offices don’t have weekend or night hours, so 
8
an applicant is at risk of losing wages when often 
9
their only option is to apply for government help 
10
during work hours. 
11
(6) Each year, many vital government programs 
12
go underutilized because eligible beneficiaries are 
13
hindered by obtrusive, time consuming, and repet-
14
itive application barriers. In 2017, according to the 
15
Department of Agriculture, 16 percent of all people 
16
eligible for supplemental nutrition assistance pro-
17
gram (SNAP), 53 percent of the ‘‘working poor’’ eli-
18
gible for SNAP, and 52 percent of adults over 60 
19
who were eligible failed to receive it. 
20
(7) The United States has hundreds of thou-
21
sands of nonprofit groups providing high quality and 
22
much needed social services, but it is nearly impos-
23
sible for struggling people to determine which of 
24
those organizations provides services they need, 
25
03:45 Jun 02, 2021
H2336
5 
•HR 2336 IH
whether the organization is conveniently located, and 
1
for which services they are eligible. If they do deter-
2
mine that a nonprofit (or multiple nonprofits) could 
3
help, they need to take yet more time to visit each 
4
one. 
5
(8) Since many government and nonprofit pro-
6
grams require frequent reapplications and recertifi-
7
cations, a low-income person often has to repeat the 
8
same endless and frustrating process. 
9
(9) Technology has fundamentally revamped the 
10
lives of most individuals, usually for the better. Ac-
11
cording to the Pew Research Center, 71 percent of 
12
low-income individuals have a smart phone as of 
13
2019 (not because a smart phone is a luxury but be-
14
cause it is an essential tool of learning and work in 
15
modern America) but they rarely can use these de-
16
vices to apply for benefits. Digital technology, com-
17
bined with policy improvements, can simplify the 
18
lives and boost the long-term self-sufficiency of our 
19
lowest income residents.
