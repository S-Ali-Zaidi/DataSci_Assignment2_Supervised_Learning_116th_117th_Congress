A BILL 
To establish that no Federal statute is intended to preempt 
a cause of action against an airport maintained in any 
State small claims or superior court by any individual 
or city within 5 miles of an airport when an action 
is brought for noise or nuisance caused by ground-based 
noise in violation of a State statute as specified, and 
for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Low-frequency Ener-
2
getic Acoustics and Vibrations Exasperate Act’’ or the 
3
‘‘LEAVE Act’’.

SEC. 2. STANDARD FOR NOISE OR NUISANCE ACTIONS. 
5
(a) STANDARD.—Notwithstanding any other provi-
6
sion of law, a standard enforceable in State court may be 
7
set by one or more States participating in a study de-
8
scribed in subsection (b) upon publication of such study. 
9
(b) STUDY.— 
10
(1) IN
GENERAL.—One or more States may 
11
conduct one or more studies of ground-based noise 
12
from aircraft operations at an airport within a 
13
State. 
14
(2) COLLABORATION.—States may collaborate 
15
on developing the methodology and standards for a 
16
study under this Act. 
17
(3) CONTENT.—A study under this Act shall— 
18
(A) identify the amount of ground-based 
19
noise emanating from one or more airports in 
20
the State or States during the study period; 
21
(B) identify the noise level above which 
22
there is present a substantial negative impact to 
23
residents and businesses within 5 miles of any 
24
airport that is studied; and 
25

•HR 4926 IH
(C) identify any diminution of real prop-
1
erty values from those that might otherwise be 
2
attained in the absence of the noise that creates 
3
a substantial negative impact. 
4
(4) BASELINE.—A study under this Act shall 
5
identify a baseline value of ground-based noise above 
6
which an airport in the study is presumed to be per-
7
mitting an excess of noise to propagate to a commu-
8
nity within 5 miles of an airport. 
9
(5) FACTORS.—Recognizing that topography, 
10
characteristics of airport construction, weather, and 
11
variable air traffic volumes are among many factors 
12
affecting the amount of perceived ground-based 
13
noise emanating from an airport, a State— 
14
(A) need not establish a uniform standard 
15
of exceedance for every airport; 
16
(B) need not limit its analysis to such fac-
17
tors; and 
18
(C) shall establish a reasonable method-
19
ology for establishing such a standard and 
20
apply such methodology across the State or 
21
States. 
22
(6) METHODOLOGY.—The methodology for es-
23
tablishing the standard may take into account— 
24

•HR 4926 IH
(A) a history of ground-based noise ema-
1
nating from the airport; 
2
(B) the reasonable expectations of im-
3
pacted residents for the quiet use and enjoy-
4
ment of owned or rented property; and 
5
(C) any other factors that a State con-
6
siders appropriate to reduce substantial nega-
7
tive impacts of noise propagating to a commu-
8
nity within 5 miles of an airport.

(7) SETTING
ASIDE
OF
METHODOLOGY
OR 
10
STANDARD.—A methodology or standard established 
11
by a State shall not be set aside unless a Federal 
12
court determines such methodology or standard to 
13
be arbitrary or capricious. 
14
(8) PUBLICATION.—A study described in this 
15
subsection shall be published. 
16
(c) PREEMPTION.—Congress hereby finds and de-
17
clares that no Federal statute is intended to preempt a 
18
cause of action against an airport maintained in any State 
19
small claims or superior court, by any individual or city 
20
within 5 miles of the airport, when an exceedance of a 
21
standard established by a State pursuant to this Act for 
22
an airport is averred. 
23
(d) DEFINITIONS.—In this Act, the following defini-
24
tions apply:

•HR 4926 IH
(1) 
GROUND-BASED
NOISE.—The 
term 
1
‘‘ground-based noise’’ means noise emanating from 
2
an aircraft operating on the ground predominately 
3
consisting of noise of 200 Hz or below. 
4
(2) SUBSTANTIAL
NEGATIVE
IMPACT.—The 
5
term ‘‘substantial negative impact’’ means a noise 
6
exceedance that is injurious to health, offensive to 
7
the senses, or an obstruction to the free use of prop-
8
erty, and interferes with the comfortable enjoyment 
9
of life or property by an entire community or neigh-
10
borhood, or by any considerable number of persons, 
11
whether or not the entire community or those con-
12
siderable number of persons participate in the cause 
13
of action.
