access point to the Gulf of Mexico with a mission to cre-
ate prosperity and to provide global access to the world’s 
cargo; 
Whereas the Houston Ship Channel has grown to sustain 
over 1,000,000 jobs in Texas and 3,200,000 jobs in the

Whereas 75 percent of the jobs created by the Houston Ship 
Channel are located in disadvantaged communities, pro-
viding ladders of opportunity to millions of individuals in 
the United States; 
Whereas the cargo traversing the Houston Ship Channel 
touches every congressional district in the United States 
and generates over $803,000,000,000 in economic impact 
across the Nation; 
Whereas expanding the Houston Ship Channel through 
Project 11 will create a safer, faster, and cleaner channel 
for all users and enable the Port of Houston to continue 
to lead the Nation as first among ports in the United 
States in total tonnage, driving regional prosperity; 
Whereas Project 11 is a pioneering approach for delivering 
this $1,000,000,000 project through Federal, local, and 
private partnerships and for rapidly providing economic 
and environmental benefits to the communities of Hous-
ton, demonstrating the collaborative power of the people 
of the United States; 
Whereas Project 11 will create hundreds of acres of bird is-
lands, marshes, and oyster reefs to protect and foster 
local ecosystems; 
Whereas Project 11 is one of the cleanest projects Port 
Houston has initiated to date and will reduce emissions 
through cleaner dredge equipment and sustainable con-
struction practices; and 
Whereas, upon completion, Project 11 will enable the millions 
of people in the United States who rely on the Houston 
Ship Channel to continue to thrive: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives com-
