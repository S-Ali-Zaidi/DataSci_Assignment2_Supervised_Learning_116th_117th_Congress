A BILL 
To authorize the National Science Foundation to award a 
monetary prize for achievement in electricity storage. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Keep Earth’s Energy 
4
Prepared and Stored Act’’ or the ‘‘KEEPS Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
The Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Dramatic advances have been made in the 
8
manner and means of acquiring oil, natural gas, 
9
coal, and other forms of carbon-based energy fuel.

(2) Dramatic advances have been made in the 
1
manner and means of producing new sources of en-
2
ergy. 
3
(3) Dramatic advances have been made in the 
4
manner and means of producing electricity from var-
5
ious forms of fuel. 
6
(4) No dramatic advances have been made in 
7
the manner and means of storing electricity, so elec-
8
tricity, when produced, must flow and be used 
9
promptly or lost. 
10
(5) If the technology and the ability to store 
11
electricity for even weeks or months were developed, 
12
the energy needs of our Nation could be met 
13
through 
completely 
clean 
and 
environmentally 
14
friendly means. 
15
(6) The value to the United States of being able 
16
to efficiently store electricity for 30 days or more is 
17
incalculable and would free the Nation from reliance 
18
on any foreign energy or environmentally destructive 
19
sources. 
20
(7) Though $500,000,000 is a sizable cash 
21
prize, if such a prize produced the technology and 
22
the ability to store electricity, it would save every 
23
American incalculable amounts of money.
