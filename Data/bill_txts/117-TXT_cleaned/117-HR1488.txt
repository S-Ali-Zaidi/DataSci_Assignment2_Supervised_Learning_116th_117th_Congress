tect and preserve the lives of all Americans, including

Whereas the continued introduction of antitransgender legis-
lation has fueled violence against transgender Americans; 
Whereas the pressure some State legislatures have pushed on 
State and local authorities to treat gender-affirming 
health care as child abuse has led to a spike in bullying 
and assault in schools, and to parents afraid their chil-
dren will be deprived of medical care or be removed from 
their homes; 
Whereas the transgender community has shown great resil-
ience in the face of adversity in all aspects of their lives, 
including housing, education, employment, and health
