Whereas the Tatmadaw has detained the elected civilian lead-
ers of the country, nullified the results of the November 
2020 democratic elections, and installed a junta, the 
State Administration Council, under a ‘‘state of emer-
gency’’; 
Whereas the Tatmadaw has restricted freedom of movement, 
telecommunications, internet service, and the media, lim-
iting access to information to and from Burma during a 
political crisis and international pandemic; 
Whereas protests opposing the coup have continued across 
Burma, and hundreds of innocent people have died at the 
hands of the Tatmadaw through the brutal use of force; 
Whereas the United States has sanctioned Tatmadaw offi-
cials, including Commander in Chief Min Aung Hlaing 
and Burma’s chief of police, Than Hlaing, and Bureau 
of Special Operations commander, Lieutenant General 
Aung Soe; 
Whereas the United States has also designated two entities 
linked to the coup leaders, Myanma Economic Holdings 
Public Company Limited (MEHL) and Myanmar Eco-
nomic Corporation Limited (MEC); 
Whereas, on April 13, 2021, the United Nation’s High Com-
missioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet said, 
‘‘There are clear echoes of Syria in 2011.’’ in the current 
situation in Burma, and warned, ‘‘I fear the situation in 
Myanmar is heading towards a full-blown conflict. States 
must not allow the deadly mistakes of the past in Syria 
and elsewhere to be repeated.’’; and 
Whereas, on February 3, 2021, United Nations Secretary 
General Anto´nio Guterres stated, ‘‘We will do everything 
we can to mobilize all the key actors and international
