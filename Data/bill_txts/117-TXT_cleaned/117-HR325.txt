RESOLUTION 
Recognizing linemen, the profession of linemen, the contribu-
tions of these brave men and women who protect public 
safety, and expressing support for the designation of 
April 18, 2021, as National Lineman Appreciation Day. 
Whereas the profession of linemen is steeped in personal, 
family, and professional tradition; 
Whereas linemen are often first responders during storms 
and other catastrophic events, working to make the scene 
safe for other public safety heroes; 
Whereas linemen must work high atop powerlines 24 hours 
a day, 365 days a year, to keep electricity flowing;
