RESOLUTION 
Supporting the designation of July 2021 as Uterine Fibroids 
Awareness Month. 
Whereas fibroids may cause significant morbidity through 
their presence in the uterus and pelvic cavity, causing 
significant pelvic pain, abnormal uterine bleeding, repro-
ductive dysfunction, miscarriages, and even infertility; 
Whereas the pain, discomfort, stress, and other physical and 
emotional symptoms of living with fibroids may signifi-
cantly interfere with a woman’s quality of life, compro-
mising her ability to function normally, work, or care for 
her family, and may lead to more severe health and 
wellness issues;

Whereas uterine fibroids are the most prevalent medical con-
dition affecting women, with an estimated 30 percent of 
women developing a uterine fibroid by age 35, and 80 
percent of women developing a uterine fibroid by age 50; 
Whereas the exact number of affected women is unknown, as 
early detection and diagnosis are difficult because only 1 
out of 4 women who have a uterine fibroid exhibit symp-
toms severe enough to require treatment; 
Whereas the overall incidence of uterine fibroids is estimated 
to disproportionately impact Black and Hispanic women, 
who also experience more severe symptoms, resulting in 
an incidence rate that is 3 times greater in women with 
Black ancestry and 2 times greater in Hispanic women 
compared to Caucasian women; 
Whereas a hysterectomy, or removal of the uterus, is among 
the most common surgical treatments for uterine 
fibroids, and more than 200,000 hysterectomies are per-
formed each year to treat uterine fibroids, at an esti-
mated annual cost of more than $2,000,000,000; 
Whereas uterine fibroids were estimated to cost the United 
States $5,900,000,000 to $34,400,000,000 annually with 
an estimated annual lost work cost of $1,600,000,000 to 
$17,200,000,000 through absenteeism and short-term 
disability in women ages 25 to 54; and 
Whereas public awareness and education campaigns on uter-
ine fibroids prevention, screening, and symptoms are held 
during the month of July each year: Now, therefore, be 
it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
