SEC. 2. FINDINGS; STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
1
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following find-
2
ings: 
3
(1) The stability and territorial unity of Libya 
4
is critical to the security of the United States, Eu-
5
rope, North Africa, and the Sahel, as well as mari-
6
time routes in the southern Mediterranean Sea. 
7
(2) 
United 
States 
Africa 
Command 
8
(AFRICOM) has identified containing instability in 
9
Libya as one of its six main lines of effort in Africa

and works to support diplomatic efforts to reconsti-
1
tute the Libyan State and to disrupt terrorist orga-
2
nizations that impede that process or threaten 
3
United States interests. 
4
(3) According to the Defense Intelligence Agen-
5
cy, the Islamic State in Libya (ISIS-Libya) is ‘‘de-
6
graded’’. However, AFRICOM continues to ‘‘keep 
7
pressure on ISIS and other violent extremist organi-
8
zations as they seek to take advantage of the secu-
9
rity vacuum created by the civil war in Libya’’. 
10
(4) On April 4, 2019, Khalifa Haftar, the com-
11
mander of the Libyan National Army (LNA) or-
12
dered forces loyal to him to begin a unilateral mili-
13
tary operation to take control of Tripoli, the capital 
14
of Libya and seat of the Government of National Ac-
15
cord (GNA), an interim body that emerged from 
16
previous United Nations-backed negotiations which 
17
the United States Government and the United Na-
18
tions Security Council have recognized since 2015. 
19
(5) During the fighting, both the LNA, the 
20
GNA, and their associated forces failed to observe 
21
their obligations under international humanitarian 
22
law, increased the geographic scope of the conflict in 
23
Libya, recruited foreign mercenaries, and intensified 
24
ground and air campaigns using heavy weapons, air-

craft, and reportedly using armed drones provided 
1
by foreign powers. 
2
(6) According to the United Nations, since the 
3
LNA offensive began in April 2019, the conflict in 
4
Libya has led to the deaths of more than 500 civil-
5
ians and the displacement of more than 200,000 
6
people. 
7
(7) Parties to the conflict in Libya have killed 
8
civilians, committed torture and abuse, committed 
9
mass extrajudicial killings, requisitioned the houses 
10
of civilians, targeted medical facilities, and blocked 
11
humanitarian access to food, health, and other life- 
12
saving services, worsening humanitarian conditions. 
13
(8) According to the United Nations, as of No-
14
vember 2020, more than 574,000 migrants and refu-
15
gees remained in Libya and the ‘‘continued arbitrary 
16
detention of migrants and refugees in formal deten-
17
tion centers and at informal smuggler sites remains 
18
a critical concern in Libya’’. Migrants and refugees, 
19
including women and children, are routinely sub-
20
jected to discrimination, arrest, arbitrary detention, 
21
torture and other human rights violations and 
22
abuses. The United Nations has called for the imme-
23
diate release, evacuation, and protection of refugees 
24
and migrants detained in conflict zones.

(9) In November 2019, the GNA and the Gov-
1
ernment of Turkey signed a Memorandum of Under-
2
standing on maritime boundaries in the Mediterra-
3
nean Sea. 
4
(10) A November 2020 Department of Defense 
5
Inspector General report estimated there are ap-
6
proximately 2,000 mercenary forces affiliated with 
7
the Wagner Group, a Russian private military com-
8
pany, as well as approximately 2,000 Russian- 
9
backed Syrian fighters, advanced equipment, and ad-
10
vanced capabilities supporting the LNA and Russian 
11
objectives in North Africa. 
12
(11) The most recent AFRICOM posture state-
13
ment claims, ‘‘Russia continues to harvest benefits 
14
from the instability in Libya—its military meddling 
15
has prolonged the conflict and exacerbated casualties 
16
and humanitarian suffering.’’. 
17
(12) The Department of Defense Inspector 
18
General reported that, ‘‘Turkey has hundreds of reg-
19
ular military personnel deployed to Libya in order to 
20
train GNA-aligned militias and to operate Turkish 
21
military equipment’’ and sent thousands of Syrian 
22
mercenaries to Libya in support of the GNA. 
23
(13) On January 19, 2020, at a peace con-
24
ference in Berlin, representatives of the Govern-

ments of Algeria, China, Egypt, France, Germany, 
1
Italy, Russia, Turkey, the Republic of Congo, the 
2
United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and 
3
the United States, as well as regional and multilat-
4
eral organizations, agreed to refrain from inter-
5
ference in Libya’s internal affairs, abide by the 
6
United Nations arms embargo, and advance a 55- 
7
point communique to resolve the conflict in Libya. 
8
(14) On February 13, 2020, the United Na-
9
tions Security Council adopted Resolution 2510, 
10
which endorses the Conclusions of the International 
11
Conference on Libya held in Berlin, affirms the need 
12
for a lasting ceasefire, demands full compliance by 
13
all member states with the United Nations arms em-
14
bargo, and expresses unequivocal support for the 
15
United Nations Special Representative and the ongo-
16
ing United Nations Support Mission in Libya 
17
(UNSMIL)-facilitated intra-Libyan dialogue. 
18
(15) On October 23, 2020, the warring parties 
19
in Libya agreed a ceasefire, which called for the 
20
withdrawal of all armed forces from conflict lines 
21
and the departure of all mercenaries and foreign 
22
fighters within three months, and was hailed by 
23
United Nations Secretary General Anto´nio Guterres

as ‘‘a fundamental step toward peace and stability 
1
in Libya’’. 
2
(16) At a November 2020 meeting of the Liby-
3
an Political Dialogue Forum, under the auspices of 
4
UNSMIL, participants agreed on a roadmap to 
5
credible, inclusive, and democratic national elections 
6
to be held in December 2021. 
7
(17) On December 2, 2020, United Nations 
8
Acting Special Representative Stephanie Williams 
9
asserted that, despite repeated international agree-
10
ments, 20,000 foreign fighters remain in Libya 
11
which represents ‘‘a serious crisis’’ and ‘‘a shocking 
12
violation of Libyan sovereignty’’. 
13
(18) On December 29, 2020, United Nations 
14
Secretary General Guterres recommended that inter-
15
national monitors deploy to Libya under United Na-
16
tions auspices to observe the October 2020 ceasefire, 
17
warned that military activities by forces supporting 
18
the warring parties and military cargo flights contin-
19
ued to impede the ceasefire, and urged implementa-
20
tion of the United Nations arms embargo. 
21
(19) On January 21, 2021, the United States 
22
joined the Governments of France, Germany, Italy, 
23
and the United Kingdom to remind all Berlin Con-
24
ference participants of the need to ‘‘continue to sup-

port a ceasefire, restore full respect for the UN arms 
1
embargo, and end the toxic foreign interference that 
2
undermines the aspirations of all Libyans to reestab-
3
lish their sovereignty and choose their future peace-
4
fully through national elections’’. 
5
(20) On February 5, 2021, the Libyan Political 
6
Dialogue Forum voted to select a new unified execu-
7
tive authority charged with leading the country until 
8
elections on December 21, 2021, an important mile-
9
stone in the Libyan political process. 
10
(21) On February 5, 2021, the United States 
11
and the Governments of France, Germany, Italy, 
12
and the United Kingdom jointly called ‘‘on all cur-
13
rent Libyan authorities and actors to ensure a 
14
smooth and constructive handover of all competences 
15
and duties to the new unified executive authority’’. 
16
(b) STATEMENT OF POLICY.—It is the policy of the 
17
United States— 
18
(1) to advance a peaceful resolution to the con-
19
flict in Libya through a United Nations-facilitated
