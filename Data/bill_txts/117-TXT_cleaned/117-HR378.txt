Whereas working forests have contributed to an increase in 
the number of trees planted in the United States and are 
sustainably managed, with less than 2 percent of working 
forests nationally harvested each year; 
Whereas a key factor in preventing forest conversion and de-
forestation is keeping forests productive; 
Whereas working forests are a critical part of a nature-based 
solution to climate change, and by providing a continuous 
cycle of growing, harvesting, and replanting, active forest 
management maximizes the ability to sequester and store 
carbon and improves forest resilience; 
Whereas private forests play an important role in conserving 
at-risk and declining species, and collaborative conserva-
tion efforts can benefit species while also helping to keep 
forests as forests; 
Whereas sustainably grown wood can be used in a wide vari-
ety of resilient infrastructure and building applications— 
from traditional timber framing to high-tech bridges to 
high-rise buildings made of mass timber—and as a nat-
ural, renewable, and biodegradable material, substituting 
wood for other materials in buildings and bridges could 
significantly decrease global carbon emissions; 
Whereas the Arbor Day Foundation and the Tree City USA 
program have been committed to greening cities and 
towns across the country since 1976, and in that time, 
more than 3,400 communities have made the commit-
ment to becoming a Tree City USA; 
Whereas Tree City USA communities are home to more than 
143,000,000 people in the United States who are dedi-
