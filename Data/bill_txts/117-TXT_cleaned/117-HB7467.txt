This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Opportunity Zones Im-

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress makes the following findings:

(1) The 8,764 population census tracts des-
8
ignated as qualified opportunity zones under section

•HR 7467 IH
1400Z–1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 span 
1
across all 50 States, the District of Columbia, and 
2
5 Territories and overwhelmingly represent commu-
3
nities that have been economically left behind as the 
4
American economy has surged forward. 
5
(2) The average poverty rate of qualified oppor-
6
tunity zone residents is 26.4 percent. 
7
(3) Fifty-four percent of the country’s pockets 
8
of concentrated persistent poverty—meaning census 
9
tracts in which at least 40 percent of the population 
10
has lived in poverty since at least 1980—are quali-
11
fied opportunity zones. 
12
(4) More adults in qualified opportunity zones 
13
lack a high school diploma than have a four-year col-
14
lege degree. 
15
(5) The Investing in Opportunity Act, which 
16
originally proposed opportunity zones, originally in-
17
corporated reporting requirements to evaluate the 
18
impact the incentive will have on designated commu-
19
nities and it is critical that Congress act to reinstate 
20
reporting requirements as soon as possible.
