SECTION 1. FINDINGS. 
3

(2) Ginsburg graduated from Cornell University 
1
in 1954, finishing first in her class. 
2
(3) Ginsburg enrolled at Harvard Law School 
3
in 1956, entering into a class of 552 men and only 
4
8 other women. 
5
(4) As a law student, Ginsburg became the first 
6
female member of the prestigious legal journal, the 
7
Harvard Law Review. She also cared for her hus-
8
band, Martin Ginsburg, who had been diagnosed 
9
with cancer, and their young daughter. 
10
(5) Ginsburg finished her legal education at Co-
11
lumbia Law School, where she graduated first in her 
12
class in 1959. 
13
(6) Ginsburg taught at Rutgers University Law 
14
School from 1963 to 1972 and at Columbia Law 
15
School from 1972 to 1980, where she became the 
16
school’s first female tenured professor. 
17
(7) During the 1970s, Ginsburg served as the 
18
director of the Women’s Rights Project of the Amer-
19
ican Civil Liberties Union. In this position, she led 
20
the fight against gender discrimination and success-
21
fully argued 6 landmark cases before the Supreme 
22
Court of the United States (in this section referred 
23
to as the ‘‘Supreme Court’’).

(8) Ginsburg won 5 cases on gender discrimina-
1
tion before the Supreme Court, including the case 
2
Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, which involved a portion 
3
of the Social Security Act that favored women over 
4
men, because the Act granted certain benefits to 
5
widows, but not widowers. 
6
(9) In 1980, President Jimmy Carter appointed 
7
Ginsburg to the United States Court of Appeals for 
8
the District of Columbia Circuit. 
9
(10) In 1993, President Bill Clinton appointed 
10
Ginsburg to the Supreme Court to fill the seat va-
11
cated by Associate Justice Byron White. 
12
(11) On August 3, 1993, the Senate confirmed 
13
Ginsburg’s nomination to the Supreme Court by a 
14
96 to 3 vote. 
15
(12) Ginsburg became the second female justice 
16
to serve on the Supreme Court as well as the first 
17
Jewish female justice to serve on the Supreme 
18
Court. 
19
(13) As a justice, Ginsburg presented a strong 
20
voice in favor of gender equality, voting rights, the 
21
rights of workers, and the separation of church and 
22
State. 
23
(14) In 1996, Ginsburg wrote the Supreme 
24
Court’s landmark decision in United States v. Vir-
25

ginia, which held that the State-supported Virginia 
1
Military Institute could not refuse to admit women. 
2
(15) Despite her reputation for restrained writ-
3
ing, Ginsburg gathered considerable attention for 
4
her dissenting opinion in Bush v. Gore by subtly 
5
concluding her decision with the words, ‘‘I dissent’’, 
6
a significant departure from the traditional ‘‘respect-
7
fully dissent’’. 
8
(16) Ginsburg famously dissented in Ledbetter 
9
v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., where the plaintiff, 
10
a female worker being paid significantly less than 
11
males with her same qualifications, sued under title 
12
VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 
13
2000e et seq.), but was denied relief under a statute 
14
of limitation issue. Ginsburg broke with tradition 
15
and wrote a high colloquial version of her dissent to 
16
read from the bench. In her dissent, she also called 
17
for Congress to undo this improper interpretation of 
18
the law. 
19
(17) Ginsburg’s impactful dissent in Ledbetter 
20
v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. led to the successful 
21
passage of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 
22
(Public Law 111–2; 123 Stat. 5), which was the 
23
first piece of legislation signed by President Barack 
24
Obama.

(18) In 2013, when the Supreme Court ruled in 
1
a 5–4 decision in Shelby County v. Holder to gut the 
2
Voting Rights Act of 1965 (52 U.S.C. 10301 et 
3
seq.), Ginsburg wrote, ‘‘Throwing out preclearance 
4
when it has worked and is continuing to work to 
5
stop discriminatory changes is like throwing away 
6
your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not 
7
getting wet.’’. 
8
(19) Until the 2018 term, Ginsburg had not 
9
missed a day of oral arguments, not even when she 
10
was undergoing chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer, 
11
after surgery for colon cancer, or the day after her 
12
husband passed away in 2010.
