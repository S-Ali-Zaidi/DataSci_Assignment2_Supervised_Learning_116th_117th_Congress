A BILL 
To amend the National Organ Transplant Act to clarify 
the definition of valuable consideration, to clarify that 
pilot programs that honor and promote organ donation 
do not violate that Act, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Organ Donation Clari-
4
fication Act of 2021’’.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 3569 IH
(1) As of March 2021, 108,000 people await an 
1
organ transplant, with 91,000 of those people wait-
2
ing for a kidney, and average wait times are ap-
3
proaching five years for a kidney, with over one-and- 
4
a-half times as many people being added to the wait-
5
ing lists as getting a transplant. 
6
(2) Of the nearly three million Americans who 
7
die annually, under 30,000, representing about one 
8
percent of all deaths each year, possess major or-
9
gans healthy enough for transplanting. 
10
(3) On average, 17 people a day died while 
11
waiting for an organ in 2020, with the majority of 
12
those people waiting for a kidney. 
13
(4) In 2020, approximately 3,800 people were 
14
removed from kidney waiting lists and approximately 
15
1,600 from liver, heart, and lungs waiting lists be-
16
cause they became permanently too sick to receive a 
17
transplant. 
18
(5) Over 75 percent of dialysis patients are not 
19
employed because dialysis requires multiple treat-
20
ments per week which last several hours and leave 
21
patients drained, thus creating a huge financial bur-
22
den on the patients, their families, and the govern-
23
ment; moreover, lost tax revenue from these individ-
24
uals is not included in the cost estimates above.

•HR 3569 IH
(6) A patient receiving a kidney transplant, and 
1
thus no longer needing dialysis, can enjoy a much 
2
higher quality of life for another 10–15 years on av-
3
erage. 
4
(7) As medical advances extend people’s lives on 
5
dialysis, the number of patients on dialysis will in-
6
crease significantly, as will the costs for individuals 
7
and the Federal Government. 
8
(8) Roughly seven percent of the Medicare 
9
budget goes to the End Stage Renal Disease Pro-
10
gram, with dialysis costing Medicare over $90,000 
11
per patient per year, as Federal law dictates that 
12
Medicare will cover dialysis for everyone who has 
13
made minimal Social Security tax payments. 
14
(9) A kidney transplant pays for itself in less 
15
than two years, with each transplant saving an aver-
16
age of $146,000 in medical costs over a 10-year pe-
17
riod, 75 percent of which is savings to the taxpayers. 
18
(10) Experts project that if the supply of trans-
19
plant kidneys could be increased to meet the de-
20
mand, 
taxpayers 
would 
save 
more 
than 
21
$14,000,000,000 per year in medical costs. 
22
(11) The World Health Organization estimates 
23
that 10 percent of all transplants take place on the 
24
international black market, the last choice for des-

perate patients facing an alternative of death, how-
1
ever recipients often receive infected kidneys and 
2
suffer poor health outcomes and donors are often 
3
victimized. 
4
(12) Present policy on domestic donation has 
5
never been subject to studies or pilots to determine 
6
effectiveness in increasing the availability of donated 
7
organs and the effectiveness of safeguards that pre-
8
vent coercion or exploitation, precludes all but altru-
9
istic donation, prohibiting any form of incentive or 
10
benefit for donors. 
11
(13) In 2010, Israel implemented sweeping 
12
changes to its national organ donation program in-
13
cluding reducing financial burdens on donors, giving 
14
future transplantation priority to registered organ 
15
donors and their families, and promoting donation 
16
by reimbursing the donor’s medical costs, 40 days of 
17
lost wages, and five years of medical and life insur-
18
ance costs, and as a result saw organ donation ap-
19
proximately triple over a 10-year period. 
20
(14) Experts are arriving at a consensus that 
21
trials are necessary to find new methods of pro-
22
moting additional organ donation which will save 
23
lives and reduce organ trafficking.
