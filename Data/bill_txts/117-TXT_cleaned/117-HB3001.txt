SEC. 5. ACTIONS TO COMBAT ONLINE CENSORSHIP AND 
1
SURVEILLANCE IN VIETNAM. 
2
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
3
(1) Vietnam continues to have one of the 
4
world’s most restrictive internet environments, with 
5
pervasive filtering of content and the frequent ar-
6
rests of bloggers and others whose only offense is to 
7
advocate online for positions different than those 
8
held by the government. 
9
(2) Since 2013, the Government of Vietnam has 
10
issued laws and decrees, including a cybersecurity 
11
law, that increased its ability to surveil its citizens 
12
without judicial oversight or recourse. The cyberse-
13
curity law has been used to charge Vietnamese citi-
14
zens with vague crimes of ‘‘negating revolutionary 
15
achievements’’ and distributing ‘‘misleading informa-
16
tion among the people’’. Vietnam’s Penal Code and 
17
Decree 15 have also been used to render many legiti-
18
mate online activities illegal, leading to the arrest 
19
and detentions of political prisoners. 
20
(3) The Government of Vietnam uses the cyber-
21
security law to require United States companies to 
22
store information in Vietnam, censor social media 
23
posts on demand, and to turn over sensitive personal 
24
information 
about 
users. 
Companies 
such 
as 
25
Facebook and Google comply with these requests, in-
26
02:33 Jun 22, 2021

10 
•HR 3001 IH
cluding through the censorship of social media con-
1
tent of United States citizens and permanent resi-
2
dent aliens. 
3
(4) United States companies Facebook and 
4
YouTube have been instrumental in this crackdown, 
5
complying with Vietnam’s request to censor and 
6
‘‘geoblock’’ content determined to violate local Viet-
7
namese law, which often contradicts international 
8
law and Vietnam’s treaty obligations. 
9
(5) In the first half of 2020, Facebook in-
10
creased its content restrictions in Vietnam by 983 
11
percent, a dramatic increase from the second half of 
12
2019. 
13
(6) Facebook complied with 90 percent of Viet-
14
nam’s censorship requests in 2020 and YouTube 
15
with 95 percent of such requests, a fact the Govern-
16
ment of Vietnam noted with satisfaction. 
17
(7) The local legal provisions that directly en-
18
abled Facebook and YouTube’s censorship, Articles 
19
117 and 331 of Vietnam’s Penal Code, also were 
20
used to imprison most of the 27 prisoners of con-
21
science who were jailed in 2020. 
22

23

3
advance national security; 
4
(B) are critical to the advancement of both 
5
United States economic interests and inter-
6
nationally recognized human rights globally; 
7
and 
8
(C) are severely hindered by Vietnam’s cy-
9
bersecurity law which would allow the Govern-
10
ment of Vietnam to access private data, spy on 
11
users, require United States businesses to turn 
12
over personally identifiable information or block 
13
content of users, including outside of Vietnam, 
14
and further restrict already limited online 
15
speech.

SEC. 8. INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM. 
9
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
10
(1) The promotion and protection of the univer-
11
sally recognized right to the freedom of religion is a 
12
priority of United States foreign policy as stated in 
13
section 402 of the International Religious Freedom 
14
Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6442) and the Bipartisan 
15
Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability 
16
Act of 2015 (title I of Public Law 114–26; 19 
17
U.S.C. 4201 et seq.) which requires the Administra-
18
tion to take religious freedom into account when ne-
19
gotiating trade agreements. 
20
(2) Countries that protect religious freedom are 
21
more prosperous, stable, peaceful and democratic. 
22
Thus, the severe restrictions faced by religious 
23
groups in Vietnam, such as members of the United 
24
Buddhist Church of Vietnam (UBCV), Catholics, 
25

•HR 3001 IH
and independent Hoa Hao Buddhists, Cao Dai, and 
1
Protestants groups, are detrimental to the interests 
2
of both the United States and Vietnam. 
3
(3) The Government of Vietnam has reportedly 
4
stepped up its efforts to force Montagnard and 
5
Hmong Christians to renounce their faith, expro-
6
priate lands and other real properties belonging to 
7
independent religious communities, destroy Hoa Hao 
8
Buddhist and Cao Dai houses of worship, and arrest 
9
and detain religious leaders. Religious leaders and 
10
advocates of religious freedom remain in prison. 
11
(b) STATEMENT OF POLICY.—Since the protection of 
12
religious freedom is vital to peace, stability, and pros-
13
perity, and countries with the highest levels of restrictions 
14
on religious freedom are often those countries seeking to 
15
undermine United States national interests or ignore 
16
international legal norms and standards, it is the policy 
17
of the United States to— 
18
(1) prioritize religious freedom in bilateral rela-
19
tions, including with the Government of Vietnam, by 
20
fully implementing the provisions of the Frank R. 
21
Wolf International Religious Freedom Act (Public 
22
Law 114–281); and

1
tools under the International Religious Freedom Act 
2
of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6401 et seq.). 
3
(c) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
4
gress that— 
5
(1) Vietnam should be designated as a country 
6
of particular concern for religious freedom under 
7
section 402(b) of the International Religious Free-
8
dom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6442(b)) because there 
9
are a significant number of individuals imprisoned 
10
for their religious activity or advocacy for religious 
11
freedom and for ‘‘systematic, egregious, and ongo-
12
ing’’ violations of religious freedom; 
13
(2) the President, in making the annual des-
14
ignations under section 402(b) of such Act, should 
15
take into account the annual report of the United 
16
States Commission on International Religious Free-
17
dom under section 203 of such Act and the Commis-
18
sion’s assessment that the designation of Vietnam as 
19
a country of particular concern for religious freedom 
20
from 2004 to 2006 led to tangible improvements in 
21
religious freedom conditions while trade and security 
22
cooperation increased; and 
23
(3) because the Government of Vietnam tightly 
24
controls religious institutions and then persecutes

those individuals who establish or operate inde-

should—

(A) use all available diplomatic, develop-
5
ment, economic assistance, and political tools to 
6
ensure that independent religious and civil soci-
7
ety organizations can operate freely and without 
8
restriction in Vietnam; and 
9
(B) raise these issues in all appropriate 
10
statements, dialogues, reports, and negotiations

SEC. 9. UNITED STATES ASSISTANCE TO SUPPORT COUNT-
15
ING OF WOMEN AND GIRLS IN VIETNAM. 
16
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
17
(1) Vietnam remains a ‘‘source and, to a lesser 
18
extent, a destination country . . . for sex trafficking 
19
and forced labor.’’. 
20
(2) Vietnamese men and women are subject to 
21
forced labor in ‘‘rehabilitation’’ centers, detention 
22

23

(b) IMPLEMENTATION OF THE GIRLS COUNT ACT OF 
6
2015 IN VIETNAM.— 
7
(1) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
8
(A) Vietnam’s male to female sex-ratio dis-
9
parity has increased despite the Vietnamese 
10
Government’s ending of its policy limiting mar-
11
ried couples to 2 children. 
12
(B) Experts believe sex ratio disparities 
13
have critical economic and social ramifications 
14
that effect United States interests, exacerbating 
15
the vulnerabilities of women to trafficking, child 
16
marriage, and reducing the ability of women to 
17
seek employment and participate in educational 
18
opportunities and civil society. 
19
(2) AUTHORIZATION.—The Secretary of State 
20
is authorized to establish and support programs to— 
21
(A) monitor and halt bride and sex traf-
22
