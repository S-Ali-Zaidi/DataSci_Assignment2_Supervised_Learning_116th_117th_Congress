fiduciary determines, in the exercise of its

fiduciary discretion, that failure to recover

payment.

payments of a non-decreasing periodic benefit

by reducing future benefit payments—

plan has recovered the full dollar amount

calendar year does not exceed the sum of the

of this subparagraph.

a civil action brought in Federal or State

‘‘(H) In determining the amount of

recoupment to seek, the responsible plan fidu-

EFFECT
OF
CULPABILITY.—Subpara-
20
graphs (A) through (F) of paragraph (4) shall not 
21
apply to protect a participant or beneficiary who is 
22
culpable. For purposes of this paragraph, a partici-
23

responsibility for the overpayment (such as through 
25

misrepresentations or omissions that led to the over-
1
payment), or if the individual knew, or had good 
2
reason to know under the circumstances, that the 
3
benefit payment or payments were materially in ex-
4
cess of the correct amount. Notwithstanding the pre-
5
ceding sentence, an individual is not culpable merely 
6
because the individual believed the benefit payment 
7
or payments were or might be in excess of the cor-
8
rect amount, if the individual raised that question 
9
with an authorized plan representative and was told 
10
the payment or payments were not in excess of the 
11
correct amount. With respect to a culpable partici-
12
pant or beneficiary, efforts to recoup overpayments 
13
shall not be made through threats of litigation, un-
14
less a lawyer for the plan could make the representa-
15
tions required under Rule 11 of the Federal Rules 
16
of Civil Procedure if the litigation were brought in
