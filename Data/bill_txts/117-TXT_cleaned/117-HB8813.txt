SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress makes the following findings: 
2
(1) In its Resolution 42/25 adopted on Sep-
3
tember 27, 2019, the United Nations Human Rights 
4
Council established an independent fact-finding mis-
5
sion, the Independent International Fact-Finding 
6
Mission on the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (in 
7
this section referred to as the ‘‘Fact-Finding Mis-
8
sion’’) ‘‘to investigate extrajudicial executions, en-
9
forced disappearances, arbitrary detentions and tor-
10
ture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treat-
11
ment since 2014 with a view to ensuring full ac-
12
countability for perpetrators and justice for vic-
13
tims’’. The mandate of the Fact-Finding Mission 
14
was extended by the United Nations Human Rights 
15
Council on October 6, 2020, for an additional two 
16
years, until September 2022, through its Resolution 
17
45/20. 
18
(2) The Fact-Finding Mission has identified 
19
specific incidents and patterns establishing reason-
20
able grounds to conclude that violations of inter-
21
national human rights and criminal law have been 
22
committed in Venezuela, according to its September 
23
2020 report. 
24
(3) The Fact-Finding Mission has faced several 
25
constraints, including lack of access to work in-coun-
26

try, travel limitations due to the COVID–19 pan-
1
demic, disrupted interviews due to electricity and 
2
internet failures, and limited ability to secure wit-
3
ness statements and key documents. Despite these 
4
challenges, the Fact-Finding Mission was able to 
5
carry out its investigative and analytical work and 
6
generate reports that serve as an invaluable resource 
7
for victims, civil society organizations, and inter-
8
national accountability mechanisms. 
9
(4) The United States has historically used its 
10
voice, vote, and influence at the United Nations to 
11
address human rights abuses around the world and 
12
to seek to hold perpetrators accountable. 
13
(5) Marta Valin˜as, Chair of the Fact-Finding 
14
Mission, reported at the 49th session of the Human 
15
Rights Council that the Venezuelan people ‘‘have en-
16
dured a decade of deepening economic, humanitarian 
17
and human rights crises, as well as the breaking 
18
down of State institutions, all of this exacerbated, 
19
most recently, by the impact of COVID–19. The 
20
clearest showing of this are the more than six mil-
21
lion people who have had to leave the country.’’.
