6
(a) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act is to improve 
7
the safety and security of Federal judges, including senior, 
8
recalled, or retired Federal judges, and their immediate 
9
family, to ensure Federal judges are able to administer 
10
justice fairly without fear of personal reprisal from indi-

viduals affected by the decisions they make in the course 
1
of carrying out their public duties. 
2
(b) RULES OF CONSTRUCTION.— 
3
(1) IN GENERAL.—Nothing in this Act shall be 
4
construed— 
5
(A) to prohibit, restrain, or limit— 
6
(i) the lawful investigation or report-
7
ing by the press of any unlawful activity or 
8
misconduct alleged to have been committed 
9
by an at-risk individual or their immediate 
10
family; or 
11
(ii) the reporting on an at-risk indi-
12
vidual or their immediate family regarding 
13
matters of public concern; 
14
(B) to impair access to decisions and opin-
15
ions from a Federal judge in the course of car-
16
rying out their public functions; or 
17
(C) to limit the publication or transfer of 
18
personally identifiable information that the at- 
19
risk individual or their immediate family mem-
20
ber voluntarily publishes on the internet after 
21
the date of enactment of this Act.

(2) PROTECTION
OF
PERSONALLY
IDENTIFI-

2
SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
3
Congress finds the following: 
4
(1) Members of the Federal judiciary perform 
5
the important function of interpreting our Constitu-
6
tion and administering justice in a fair and impartial 
7
manner. 
8
(2) In recent years, partially as a result of the 
9
rise in the use of social media and online access to 
10
information, members of the Federal judiciary have 
11
been exposed to an increased number of personal 
12
threats in connection to their role. The ease of ac-
13
cess to free or inexpensive sources of personally 
14
identifiable information has considerably lowered the 
15
effort required for malicious actors to discover where 
16
individuals live, where they spend leisure hours, and 
17
to find information about their family members. 
18
Such threats have included calling a judge a traitor 
19
with references to mass shootings and serial killings, 
20
calling for an ‘‘angry mob’’ to gather outside a 
21
judge’s home and, in reference to a United States 
22
courts of appeals judge, stating how easy it would be 
23
to ‘‘get them.’’ 
24

•HR 4436 IH
(3) Between 2015 and 2019, threats and other 
1
inappropriate 
communications 
against 
Federal 
2
judges and other judiciary personnel increased from 
3
926 in 2015 to approximately 4,449 in 2019. 
4
(4) Over the past decade, several members of 
5
the Federal judiciary have experienced acts of vio-
6
lence against themselves or a family member in con-
7
nection to their Federal judiciary role, including the 
8
murder of the family of United States District 
9
Judge for the Northern District of Illinois Joan 
10
Lefkow in 2005. 
11
(5) On Sunday July 19, 2020, an assailant 
12
went to the home of Esther Salas, a judge for the 
13
United States District Court for the District of New 
14
Jersey, impersonating a package delivery driver, 
15
opening fire upon arrival, and killing Daniel Anderl, 
16
the 20-year-old only son of Judge Salas, and seri-
17
ously wounding Mark Anderl, her husband. 
18
(6) In the aftermath of the recent tragedy that 
19
occurred to Judge Salas and in response to the con-
20
tinuous rise of threats against members of the Fed-
21
eral judiciary, there is an immediate need for en-
22
hanced security procedures and increased availability 
23
of tools to protect Federal judges and their families.
