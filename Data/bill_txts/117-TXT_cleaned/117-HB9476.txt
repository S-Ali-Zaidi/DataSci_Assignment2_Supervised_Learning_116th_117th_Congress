A BILL 
To protect against seasonal and pandemic influenza, and 
for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Protecting America 
4
from Seasonal and Pandemic Influenza Act of 2022’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

The Congress finds the following:

•HR 9476 IH
(1) Influenza occurs seasonally each year, and 
1
throughout 
history 
has 
caused 
devastating 
2
pandemics. The 1918 influenza pandemic killed an 
3
estimated 675,000 Americans. 
4
(2) In an average season, influenza results in 
5
12,000 to 52,000 deaths in the United States, in-
6
cluding over 100 pediatric deaths. Additionally, in-
7
fluenza causes hundreds of thousands of hospitaliza-
8
tions and millions of illnesses. 
9
(3) The Council of Economic Advisors issued a 
10
report in 2019 estimating that seasonal influenza 
11
costs 
the 
United 
States 
approximately 
12
$361,000,000,000 per year, and that an influenza 
13
pandemic has the potential to cause up to 
14
$3,790,000,000,000 in losses. This report was 
15
issued prior to the COVID–19 pandemic, which will 
16
cost 
the 
United 
States 
an 
estimated 
17
$16,000,000,000,000. 
18
(4) Most funding for pandemic influenza pre-
19
paredness up until fiscal year 2018 was derived from 
20
supplemental appropriations that dated back to the 
21
2009 H1N1 pandemic. 
22
(5) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
23
(in this preamble referred to as the ‘‘CDC’’) studies 
24

nicity during 10 influenza seasons from 2009 to 
1
2019 showed that people from racial and ethnic mi-
2
nority groups are at higher risk for being hospital-
3
ized with influenza. 
4
(6) The COVID–19 pandemic response has 
5
been built on the pandemic influenza response eco-
6
system. 
7
(7) Strategies that increase seasonal influenza 
8
vaccination rates will also improve pandemic readi-
9
ness. 
10
(8) The National Influenza Vaccine Moderniza-
11
tion Strategy of 2020–2030 of the Department of 
12
Health and Human Services should be implemented 
13
as quickly as possible to ensure the Nation’s vaccine 
14
enterprise is highly responsive, flexible, scalable, and 
15
effective at reducing the impact of seasonal and pan-
16
demic influenza viruses. 
17
(9) Influenza surveillance has been improved 
18
significantly over the last several years by deploying 
19
next-generation gene sequencing tools to analyze cir-
20
culating influenza viruses. The technology allows the 
21
CDC to study more influenza viruses faster and in 
22
more detail, and to monitor genetic changes in influ-
23
enza viruses to better understand and improve the 
24
effectiveness of influenza vaccines.

•HR 9476 IH
(10) Vaccine hesitancy in the United States has 
1
reached a tipping point where it is adversely affect-
2
ing public health. Misinformation is widely available 
3
on social media, and traditional sources of informa-
4
tion on the value and efficacy of vaccines are not 
5
trusted by many Americans, especially those who are 
6
vaccine hesitant. 
7
(11) Support for vaccine communication, out-
8
reach, and administration across public health and 
9
health care settings is critical to drive demand of in-
10
fluenza vaccines, treatments, and medical counter-
11
measures and ensure equitable uptake of these inno-
12
vations.
