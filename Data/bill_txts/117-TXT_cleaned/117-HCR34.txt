Whereas a carbon tax will lead to less economic growth; 
Whereas American families will be harmed the most from a 
carbon tax; 
Whereas, according to the Energy Information Administra-
tion, the share of energy consumption during 2019 in the 
United States that was derived from fossil fuels was ap-
proximately 80 percent; 
Whereas a carbon tax will increase the cost of every good 
manufactured in the United States; 
Whereas a carbon tax will impose disproportionate burdens 
on certain industries, jobs, States, and geographic re-
gions and would further restrict the global competitive-
ness of the United States; 
Whereas American ingenuity has led to innovations in energy 
exploration and development and has increased produc-
tion of domestic energy resources on private and State- 
owned land which has created significant job growth and 
private capital investment; 
Whereas the energy policy of the United States should en-
courage continued private sector innovation and develop-
ment and not increase the existing tax burden on manu-
facturers; 
Whereas the production of American energy resources in-
creases the ability of the United States to maintain a 
competitive advantage in today’s global economy; 
Whereas a carbon tax would reduce America’s global competi-
tiveness and would encourage development abroad in 
countries that do not impose this exorbitant tax burden;
