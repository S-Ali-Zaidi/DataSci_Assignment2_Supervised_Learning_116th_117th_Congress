To amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to provide 
States an option to cover a children’s program of all- 
inclusive coordinated care (ChiPACC) under Medicaid 
program. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘ChiPACC Act of

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds that—

•HR 4952 IH
(1) serious illnesses and health conditions that 
1
are potentially life-threatening place significant 
2
stress on both the child and family; 
3
(2) palliative care relieves children’s symptoms 
4
such as pain, fatigue, anxiety, nausea, and sleep 
5
problems, and may be provided at any age or stage 
6
of serious illness, and has been shown to enhance 
7
the quality of life for both the child and family; 
8
(3) many critical barriers to end-of-life care for 
9
children exist under the current health care system, 
10
including the limitation of hospice care under the 
11
Medicaid program to children expected to live six 
12
months or less, a prognosis that medical profes-
13
sionals and families are reluctant to make; 
14
(4) the Children’s Program of All-inclusive Co-
15
ordinated Care (referred to in this Act as 
16
‘‘ChiPACC’’) provides all-inclusive care for children 
17
with life-threatening conditions and their families 
18
from the time of diagnosis and— 
19
(A) fills a gap in coverage under the Med-
20
icaid program of integrated, multi-disciplinary 
21
services that are reasonable and necessary for 
22
the palliation and management of seriously ill 
23
children;

•HR 4952 IH
(B) serves a population that includes chil-
1
dren who are not yet hospice eligible; and 
2
(C) provides greater coordination of pallia-
3
tive and curative services for children through-
4
out the course of their illness or condition, 
5
which may begin at the time of diagnosis; 
6
(5) some States have opted to provide services 
7
targeted to this population through waivers under 
8
subsections (b) and (c) of section 1915 of the Social 
9
Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396n), each of which re-
10
quires the approval of the Centers for Medicare & 
11
Medicaid Services of the initial waiver application 
12
and any subsequent renewal of such waiver; 
13
(6) since 2005, the Secretary of Health and 
14
Human Services has approved home and community- 
15
based service waivers under section 1915(c) of such 
16
Act (42 U.S.C. 1396n(c)) to operate ChiPACC in 
17
five States; 
18
(7) in States operating ChiPACC under such a 
19
waiver— 
20
(A) the respective State’s Medicaid pro-
21
gram achieved significant cost savings through 
22
a reduction in inpatient care and an increase in 
23
less expensive outpatient care; 
24
17:01 Aug 24, 2021
H4952
4 
•HR 4952 IH
(B) access to CHIPACC services in such 
1
States reduced more costly utilizations of other 
2
services; and 
3
(C) services provided through ChiPACC 
4
are less costly to the State’s Medicaid program 
5
because ChiPACC facilitates children receiving 
6
palliative care at home rather than receiving 
7
such services in an inpatient hospital setting; 
8
and 
9
(8) allowing States the option to implement 
10
ChiPACC through a State plan amendment would— 
11
(A) give States the ability to make such 
12
program a part of a State’s Medicaid program 
13
while avoiding the lengthy waiver process; and 
14
(B) give States the flexibility to establish 
15
and design its program to fit the needs of the 
16
respective State.
