SENT ORDERS.—Any consent order entered into by the 
2
Commission shall include a termination clause that the

consent order shall expire not later than 8 years after the 
4
date on which the consent order is entered into, unless 
5
such consent order relates to alleged fraud by the entity 
6
subject to the consent order and requires a time limit 
7
longer than 8 years based on the factors described in this 
8
subsection. In determining the time limit for any termi-
9

‘‘(1) The impact of technological progress on 
12
the continuing relevance of the consent order.

‘‘(2) Whether there is reason to believe that the

entity would engage in activities that violate this sec-
15
tion without the consent order 8 years after the con-
16
sent order is entered into by the Commission.

‘‘(p) CONSENT ORDER REVIEW.—Any consent order 
18
entered into by the Commission that is unrelated to al-
19
leged fraud by the entity subject to the consent order and 
20
has a termination date more than 5 years after such con-
21
sent order is entered into shall include a clause providing 
22
for Commission review of the consent order 5 years after 
23
the date on which the order is entered into. Such clause 
24
shall require the Commission to evaluate whether the con-

sent order continues to serve its initial purposes based on 
1
the factors described in subsection (o). The clause shall

4
poses, the Commission shall terminate the consent order.

‘‘(q) PETITION FOR REVIEW OF EXISTING CONSENT 
6
ORDERS.—Any entity that as of the effective date of this 
7
subsection is subject to a consent order that is unrelated 
8
to alleged fraud and has been effective for a period of at 
9
least five years may petition the Commission to terminate 
10
such consent order. In evaluating a petition to terminate 
11
a consent order under this subsection, the Commission 
12
shall consider whether the consent order continues to serve 
13
its initial purposes based on each of the factors described 
14
in subsection (o). If, based on such evaluation, the Com-
15
mission determines that the consent order no longer serves 
16
its purposes, the Commission shall terminate the consent 
17
order.’’.

19
ment made by subsection (a) shall take effect on the date
