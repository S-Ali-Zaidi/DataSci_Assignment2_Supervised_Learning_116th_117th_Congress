(1) According to the Association of Schools of 
1
Public Health, projections indicate a nationwide 
2
shortage of up to 250,000 public health workers 
3
needed by 2020. 
4
(2) Similar trends are projected for other health 
5
professions indicating shortages across disciplines, 
6
including within the fields of nursing (500,000 by 
7
2025), dentistry (15,000 by 2025), pharmacy 
8
(38,000 by 2030), mental and behavioral health, pri-
9
mary care (46,000 by 2025), and community and al-
10
lied health. 
11
(3) A nationwide health workforce shortage will 
12
result in serious health threats and more severe and 
13
costly health care needs, due to, in part, a delayed 
14
response to food-borne outbreaks, emerging infec-
15
tious diseases, natural disasters, fewer cancer 
16
screenings, and delayed treatment. 
17
(4) Vulnerable and underserved populations and 
18
health professional shortage areas will be most se-
19
verely impacted by the health workforce shortage. 
20
(5) According to the Migration Policy Institute, 
21
over 2,000,000 college-educated immigrants in the 
22
United States today are unemployed or under-
23
employed in low- or semi-skilled jobs that fail to 
24
draw on their education and expertise.
