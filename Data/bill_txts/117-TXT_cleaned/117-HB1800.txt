A BILL 
To require a review of women and lung cancer, and for 
other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Women and Lung Can-

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds as follows: 
7
(1) According to the American Cancer Society, 
8
in the United States, approximately 171 women die

each day of lung cancer, or about one woman every 
1
8.4 minutes. 
2
(2) Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer 
3
death among women. 
4
(3) The American Cancer Society estimates 
5
that 62,470 women will die of lung cancer in 2021. 
6
(4) Studies have shown a higher incidence rate 
7
of lung cancer for women who were never smokers 
8
compared to men who were never smokers. 
9
(5) According to the American Cancer Society, 
10
new cases of lung cancer dropped by 3 percent per 
11
year in men from 2011 to 2015, while new cases in 
12
women only dropped 1.5 percent per year in the 
13
same time period. 
14
(6) According to the 2014 report, ‘‘The Health 
15
Consequences of Smoking—50 Years of Progress: A 
16
Report of the Surgeon General, 2014’’, the relative 
17
risk of developing lung cancer increased tenfold 
18
among female smokers between 1959 and 2010. 
19
(7) According to the American Cancer Society, 
20
approximately 40 percent of lung cancers are adeno-
21
carcinoma, a subtype of non-small cell lung cancer, 
22
which is the most common type of cancer seen in 
23
non-smokers and is more common in women than in 
24
men.

(8) According to the Environmental Protection 
1
Agency, exposure to radon accounts for approxi-
2
mately 21,000 deaths from lung cancer each year 
3
and is the leading cause of lung cancer in non-smok-
4
ers. 
5
(9) A Government Accountability Office report 
6
published on October 22, 2015, called for the Na-
7
tional Institutes of Health to do more in evaluating 
8
gender differences in research. 
9
(10) Additional research strategies, including 
10
clinical trials, are necessary to explore the dif-
11
ferences in lung cancer risk factors, incidence, and 
12
treatment response in women, and to address the 
13
disparate impact of lung cancer on women who have 
14
never smoked. 
15
(11) Lung cancer screening, which can detect 
16
lung cancer at its earliest, most curable stage, is a 
17
covered service available without cost-sharing for 
18
those at high risk. 
19
(12) Published peer-reviewed actuarial studies 
20
indicate that lung cancer screening individuals at 
21
high risk may be cost-effective. 
22
(13) The National Framework of Excellence in 
23
Lung Cancer Screening and Continuum of Care, 
24
launched in 2012, demonstrated that lung cancer 
25

screening can be safely and effectively carried out in 
1
community hospital settings around the Nation. 
2
(14) Information on the impact of lung cancer 
3
on women and the importance of early detection 
4
should be incorporated into all relevant public health 
5
awareness campaigns. 
6
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS CONCERNING WOMEN AND 
7
LUNG CANCER. 
8
It is the sense of Congress that— 
9
(1) there is a disparate impact of lung cancer 
10
on women and, in particular, on women who have 
11
never smoked; 
12
(2) additional research strategies to explore the 
13
differences in women with respect to lung cancer 
14
risk factors, incidence, histology, and response to 
15
treatment are justified and necessary; 
16
(3) the implementation of lung cancer preven-
17
tive services for women should be accelerated; and 
18
(4) the public health agencies of the Federal 
19
Government should coordinate public education and 
20
awareness programs on the impact of lung cancer on 
21
women and the importance of early detection.

(a) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary of Health and

and

(b) CONTENT.—The review and recommendations 
17
under subsection (a) shall include—

(1) a review and comprehensive report on the 
19
outcomes of previous research, the status of existing 
20
research activities, and knowledge gaps related to

eliminate knowledge gaps in research; 
2
(B) evaluate environmental and genomic
