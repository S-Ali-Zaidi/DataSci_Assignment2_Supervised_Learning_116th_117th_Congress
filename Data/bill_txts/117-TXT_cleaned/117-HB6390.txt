A BILL 
To make financial assistance under the Rural Energy for 
America program available with respect to certain electric 
vehicle supply equipment expenses. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Electric Vehicle Charg-
4
ing Infrastructure for Farmers Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
The Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) The transition to electric vehicles is a crit-
8
ical step towards reducing global emissions. Accord-
9
ing to the United States Department of Energy,

‘‘electric vehicles produce fewer emissions that con-
1
tribute to climate change and smog than internal 
2
combustion vehicles’’. 
3
(2) Nearly half of all people in the United 
4
States live in counties with unhealthy levels of ozone 
5
or particle pollution. Every year, more than 20,000 
6
people in the United States die prematurely from 
7
pollution stemming from the transportation sector. 
8
(3) Demand for publicly accessible electric vehi-
9
cle chargers continues to grow. The National Renew-
10
able Energy Laboratory estimates that by 2050, be-
11
tween 106,000 and 138,000 stations with 343,000 
12
and 447,000 ports could be needed to meet con-
13
sumer demand. 
14
(4) Travel by people who live in rural areas 
15
constitutes 68 percent of our Nation’s lane miles, 
16
but such people represent only 19 percent of our Na-
17
tion’s population. The cost per mile traveled is lower 
18
for electric vehicles, saving rural drivers thousands 
19
of dollars over the lifetimes of their vehicles.
