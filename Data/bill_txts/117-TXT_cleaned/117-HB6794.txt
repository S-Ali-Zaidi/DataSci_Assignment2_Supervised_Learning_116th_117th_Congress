SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Our border security is directly tied to our 
3
national security. 
4
(2) U.S. Customs and Border Protection faces 
5
a daunting challenge in maintaining situational 
6
awareness along the United States northern and 
7
southern borders. 
8
(3) The United States northern border is the 
9
longest common non-militarized border between two 
10
countries. 
11
(4) The United States southern border is nearly 
12
2,000 miles long, stretching across rugged and var-
13
ied terrain. 
14
(5) Emerging technologies present an oppor-
15
tunity to reduce current strains on manpower while 
16
improving situational awareness along the northern 
17
and southern borders. 
18
(6) U.S. Customs and Border Protection is cur-
19
rently testing a number of emerging technology pro-
20
grams that will help improve situational awareness 
21
along the northern and southern borders. 
22
(7) Successfully integrating these technologies 
23
into a layered border defense requires a strategic 
24
plan for transitioning new programs from the testing

land Security shall develop and submit to the Committee 
9
on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives 
10
and the Committee on Homeland Security and Govern-
11
mental Affairs of the Senate a plan to identify, deploy, 
12
and integrate emerging and advanced technologies, such 
13
as artificial intelligence, machine-learning, automation, 
14
fiber-optic sensing technology, nanotechnology, optical and 
15
cognitive radar, modeling and simulation technology, 
16
hyperspectral and LIDAR sensors, imaging, identification, 
17
and categorization systems, and other similar emerging 
18
and advanced technologies, to achieve greater situational 
19
awareness along the northern and southern borders of the 
20
United States between ports of entry.

2
along the northern and southern borders of the 
3
United States. 
4
(2) An assessment of how border security capa-
5
bility gaps can be addressed through the integration 
6
and deployment of such technologies. 
7
(3) Cost estimates for the acquisition and main-
8
tenance, as the case may be, of technologies referred 
9
to in such subsection. 
10
(4) Metrics to measure how technologies re-
11
ferred to in such subsection will assist in supporting

21
Federal departments and agencies not in use by 
22
CBP that could assist in improving situational 
23
awareness, and how such technologies would be uti-
24
lized.
