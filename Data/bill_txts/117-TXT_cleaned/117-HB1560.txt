SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Resources for Victims 
2
of Gun Violence Act of 2021’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) In the United States, more than 100 indi-
6
viduals are killed with guns every day, totaling near-
7
ly 40,000 individuals who die from gun violence 
8
every year. 
9
(2) Additionally, more than 230 individuals sus-
10
tain a nonfatal gun injury every day. According to 
11
a recent national poll, an estimated 10,000,000 indi-
12
viduals in the United States have been shot and in-
13
jured in their lifetimes. 
14
(3) In that same poll, approximately 58 percent 
15
of adults in the United States reported that they, or 
16
someone they care for, have experienced a form of 
17
gun violence, including a gun suicide, a gun homi-
18
cide, domestic violence involving a gun, or an unin-
19
tentional shooting. 
20
(4) Nearly two-thirds of gun-related deaths in 
21
the United States are suicides. Most individuals who 
22
attempt suicide do not die—unless they use a gun. 
23
Approximately 90 percent of gun suicide attempts 
24
end in death, whereas 4 percent of suicide attempts 
25
not involving a firearm result in death.

•HR 1560 IH
(5) This is particularly concerning for veterans, 
1
children, and teenagers. Veterans are 1.5 times more 
2
likely than non-veterans to die by suicide, and in 
3
2017, 69 percent of veteran suicides were by gun. 
4
Among children and teenagers, the rate of gun sui-
5
cide has increased 59 percent over the past 10 years. 
6
(6) An estimated 40,000,000 adults in the 
7
United States report someone they cared for had at-
8
tempted or died by suicide with a gun. 
9
(7) More than one-third of gun-related deaths 
10
in the United States are homicides, and in 2015, the 
11
gun homicide rate in the United States was nearly 
12
25 times higher than in other high-income countries. 
13
(8) Gun homicides in the United States occur 
14
disproportionately in cities, particularly in racially 
15
segregated neighborhoods with high rates of poverty. 
16
Gun homicide disproportionately affects communities 
17
of color, and Black Americans represent the major-
18
ity of gun homicide victims. 
19
(9) More than 600 mass shootings, defined as 
20
shootings in which 4 or more individuals were shot 
21
and killed or injured, took place in the United States 
22
in 2020, and more than 2,600 mass shootings have 
23
taken place since the shooting at Sandy Hook Ele-
24
mentary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012.

•HR 1560 IH
(10) Firearms are the leading cause of death 
1
for children and teenagers. In 2019, more than 
2
3,300 children and teenagers were shot and killed. 
3
Each year, approximately 15,600 children and teen-
4
agers are shot and injured. Black children and teen-
5
agers are 14 times more likely than their white peers 
6
to die by gun homicide. 
7
(11) During an average year in the United 
8
States, more than 600 women are shot to death by 
9
an intimate partner, and many more women are shot 
10
and injured by an intimate partner. Nearly 
11
1,000,000 women in the United States who are alive 
12
today have been shot or shot at by an intimate part-
13
ner, and approximately 4,500,000 women in the 
14
United States today have been threatened with a 
15
gun by an intimate partner. 
16
(12) More than 10,300 violent hate crimes com-
17
mitted in the United States in an average year in-
18
volve a gun, or more than 28 each day. The vast 
19
majority of hate crimes are directed against commu-
20
nities of color, religious minorities, and individuals 
21
in the LGBTQ+ community. 
22
(13) In 2020, communities and cities across the 
23
United States experienced an increase in gun vio-
24
lence and gun homicides as the country struggled 
25
22:08 Apr 17, 2021
H1560

•HR 1560 IH
with the economic and social uncertainty caused by 
1
the COVID–19 pandemic. 
2
(14) From March 2020 through November 
3
2020, an estimated 17,400,000 guns were sold, an 
4
81 percent increase over the same period in 2019. 
5
This unprecedented surge in gun sales put children, 
6
victims of domestic abuse, and communities of color 
7
at an even greater risk of gun violence. 
8
(15) The individuals who survive gun violence 
9
every year in the United States face a lifelong proc-
10
ess of physical and emotional healing, in addition to 
11
the heavy economic costs faced by those survivors, 
12
their families and communities, and society as a 
13
whole. Furthermore, victims of gun violence are 
14
often unaware of or have trouble accessing many 
15
available resources that could help them in their re-
16
covery. 
17
(16) Victims of gun violence experience per-
18
sistent mental health problems, including post-trau-
19
matic stress, depression, self-harm, anxiety, and sub-
20
stance abuse. The National Center for PTSD (Post- 
21
Traumatic Stress Disorder) of the Department of 
22
Veterans Affairs estimates that 28 percent of indi-
23
viduals who witness a mass shooting develop PTSD, 
24
and about one-third of those individuals develop 
25
22:08 Apr 17, 2021

•HR 1560 IH
acute stress disorder. Victims of gun violence suffer 
1
from increased rates of unemployment, and young 
2
victims of gun violence are more likely to have lower 
3
grades and more absences from school. 
4
(17) Young people who survive gun-related inci-
5
dents are also at risk of experiencing gun violence 
6
again in the future. One study estimated that nearly 
7
one-fourth of the individuals who survive a gun 
8
shooting at age 24 or younger will be shot again 
9
within the next 10 years. 
10
(18) Given the immense physical and emotional 
11
toll of gun violence on victims, Congress must do 
12
more to ensure that victims of gun violence have ac-
13
cess to the resources they need to recover from their 
14
trauma—especially for victims experiencing common, 
15
everyday gun violence in racially segregated neigh-
16
borhoods with high rates of poverty and chronic dis-
17
investment.
