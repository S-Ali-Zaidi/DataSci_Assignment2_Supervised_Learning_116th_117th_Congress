SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) The North Korean Human Rights Act of 
8
2004 (Public Law 108–333; 22 U.S.C. 7801 et seq.) 
9
and subsequent reauthorizations were the product of

broad, bipartisan consensus regarding the promotion 
1
of human rights, documentation of human rights 
2
violations, transparency in the delivery of humani-
3
tarian assistance, and the importance of refugee pro-
4
tection. 
5
(2) The human rights and humanitarian condi-
6
tions within the Democratic People’s Republic of 
7
North Korea (DPRK) remain deplorable and have 
8
been intentionally perpetuated against the people of 
9
North Korea through policies endorsed and imple-
10
mented by Kim Jong-Un and the Korean Workers’ 
11
Party. 
12
(3) According to a 2014 report released by the 
13
United Nations Commission of Inquiry, between 
14
80,000 and 120,000 children, women, and men are 
15
currently being held in political prison camps in 
16
North Korea and are subjected to deliberate starva-
17
tion, forced labor, executions, torture, rape, forced 
18
abortion, and infanticide. 
19
(4) North Korea continues to hold a number of 
20
South Koreans abducted after the signing of the 
21
1953 armistice agreement and refuses to acknowl-
22
edge the abduction of over 100,000 South Koreans 
23
during the Korean war in violation of the Geneva 
24
Convention.

(5) Human rights violations in North Korea, 
1
which include forced starvation, sexual violence 
2
against women and children, restrictions on freedom 
3
of movement, arbitrary detention, torture, execu-
4
tions, and enforced disappearances, amount to 
5
crimes against humanity according to the United 
6
Nations Commission of Inquiry (COI) on Human 
7
Rights in the DPRK. 
8
(6) The effects of the COVID–19 pandemic and 
9
the DPRK’s strict lockdown of its borders and 
10
crackdowns on informal market activities and small 
11
entrepreneurship have drastically increased food in-
12
security for its people and given rise to famine con-
13
ditions in parts of the country. 
14
(7) The DPRK’s COVID–19 border lockdown 
15
measures also include shoot-to-kill orders that has 
16
resulted in the killing of North Koreans attempting 
17
to cross the border and at least one South Korean 
18
citizen in September 2020. 
19
(8) The Government of the People’s Republic of 
20
China (PRC) is aiding and abetting in crimes 
21
against humanity by forcibly repatriating North Ko-
22
rean refugees to the DPRK. Upon repatriation, 
23
North Koreans are sent to prison camps, harshly in-
24
terrogated, tortured, or executed. The Government

of the People’s Republic of China’s forcible repatri-
1
ation of North Korean refugees violates its non- 
2
refoulement obligations, under the United Nations 
3
Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, done 
4
at Geneva July 28, 1951 (as made applicable by the 
5
Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, done at 
6
New York January 31, 1967 (19 UST 6223)). 
7
(9) The DPRK continues to bar freedom of re-
8
ligion and persecute religious minorities, especially 
9
Christians. Eyewitnesses reported that Christians in 
10
North Korea have been tortured, forcibly detained, 
11
and even executed for possessing a Bible or pro-
12
fessing Christianity. 
13
(10) Broadcasting operations into the DPRK 
14
serve as a critical source of outside news and infor-
15
mation for the North Korean people and provides a 
16
valuable service for countering propaganda and false 
17
narratives. 
18
(11) The position of Special Envoy on North 
19
Korean Human Rights Issues has been vacant since 
20
January 2017, although the President is required to 
21
appoint a Senate-confirmed Special Envoy to fill this 
22
position in accordance with section 107 of the North 
23
Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 (22 U.S.C. 
24

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
1
It is the sense of Congress that— 
2
(1) promoting information access in North 
3
Korea continues to be a successful method of coun-
4
tering DPRK propaganda and the United States 
5
Government should continue to support nongovern-
6
mental radio broadcasting to North Korea and pro-
7
mote other emerging methods in this space; 
8
(2) because refugees among North Koreans 
9
fleeing into China face severe punishments upon 
10
their forcible return, the United States should urge 
11
the Government of the People’s Republic of China 
12
to— 
13
(A) immediately halt its forcible repatri-
14
ation of North Koreans who would face perse-
15
cution or torture upon return; 
16
(B) allow the United Nations High Com-
17
missioner for Refugees (UNHCR) unimpeded 
18
access to North Koreans inside China to deter-
19
mine whether they are refugees and whether 
20
they require assistance; 
21
(C) fulfill its obligations under the 1951 
22
United Nations Convention Relating to the Sta-
23
tus of Refugees, the 1984 Convention against 
24
Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrad-
25

3
China to UNHCR Branch Office in the Peo-
4
ple’s Republic of China (signed December 1,

1995); 
6
(D) address the concerns of the United 
7
Nations Committee against Torture by incor-
8
porating into domestic legislation the principle 
9
of non-refoulement; and 
10
(E) recognize the legal status of North Ko-
11
rean women who marry or have children with 
12
Chinese citizens, and ensure that all such moth-
13
ers and children are granted resident status 
14
and access to education and other public serv-
15
ices in accordance with Chinese law and con-
16
sistent with international standards; 
17
(3) the United States Government should con-
18
tinue to promote the effective and transparent deliv-
19
ery and distribution of any humanitarian aid pro-
20
vided in North Korea to ensure it reaches its in-
21

(4) the United States currently blocks United 
1
States passports from being used to travel to North 
2
Korea without a special validation from the Depart-
3
ment of State, and the Department of State should 
4
continue to take steps to increase public awareness 
5
about the risks and dangers of travel by United 
6
States citizens to North Korea; 
7
(5) the United Nations has a significant role to 
8
play in promoting and improving human rights in 
9
North Korea and should press for access for the 
10
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights 
11
in North Korea, as well as for the United Nations 
12
High Commissioner for Human Rights; 
13
(6) the Special Envoy for North Korean 
14
Human Rights Issues should be appointed without 
15
delay to properly promote and coordinate North Ko-
16
rean human rights and humanitarian issues and to 
17
participate in policy planning and implementation 
18
with respect to refugee issues;

(7) the United States should urge North Korea 
20
to repeal the Reactionary Thought and Culture De-
21
nunciation Law and other draconian laws, regula-
22
tions, and decrees as their implementation mani-
23

(8) the United States should urge North Korea

to ensure that any restrictions on addressing the

COVID–19 pandemic are necessary, proportionate, 
5
nondiscriminatory, time-bound, and transparent, and 
6
allow international staff to operate inside the DPRK 
7
to provide international assistance based on inde-
8
pendent needs assessments; 
9
(9) the United States should continue to seek 
10
cooperation from all foreign governments to allow 
11
the UNHCR access to process North Korean refu-
12
gees overseas for resettlement; and 
13
(10) the Secretary of State, through diplomacy 
14
by senior officials, including United States ambas-
15
sadors to Asia-Pacific countries, and in close co-
16
operation with South Korea, should make every ef-
17
