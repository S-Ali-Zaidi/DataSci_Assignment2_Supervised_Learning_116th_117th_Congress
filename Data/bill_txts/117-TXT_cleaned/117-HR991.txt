RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the President of the United States should take immediate 
steps to support the transfer of requested fighter aircraft 
to the Government of Ukraine for self-defense against 
invasion of their sovereign state. 
Whereas, on February 24, 2022, Russia initiated a malicious, 
unprovoked invasion of the sovereign state of Ukraine; 
Whereas this onslaught has continued and intensified in the 
days and weeks since; 
Whereas the Ukrainian leadership, its military, and its citi-
zens have demonstrated fierce commitment to fight the

Russian aggression, and the nation’s brave and steadfast 
resistance has significantly hindered the invasion and has 
earned the admiration, praise, and sympathy of the vast 
majority of the international community; 
Whereas Russia has significantly increased its targeting of 
innocent men, women, children, and elderly, as well as ci-
vilian infrastructure such as houses, apartment buildings, 
schools, and hospitals; 
Whereas Russia has both failed to negotiate in good faith and 
to abide by commitments to provide for safe humani-
tarian corridors for civilians to flee the war to safety; 
Whereas equipping the Ukrainian Air Force to secure its own 
airspace, to suppress aerial attacks and reconnaissance, 
and to increase the safe mobility of Ukrainian ground 
forces could help reduce the need for, and the pressure 
on, the international community to enter the war on hu-
manitarian grounds, thus reducing risk of involving addi-
tional combatants; 
Whereas the United States has consistently maintained that 
it would supply Ukraine with weapons to defend its bor-
ders and sovereignty, and has already delivered signifi-
cantly on that pledge; 
Whereas Congress has appropriated and the President has 
signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, in-
cluding approximately $13,600,000,000 in additional 
emergency assistance for the situation in Ukraine; 
Whereas Poland has recently made an offer to provide 28 
MiG–29 fighter aircraft for the purpose of delivery to 
Ukraine; and 
Whereas Ukrainian pilots are already trained to fly and 
maintain this aircraft, and their delivery could help se-
