buyer makes some form of a down payment to the 
1
owner, receives the deed or title to the home and 
2
then makes installment payments to the owner over 
3
a defined period of time. 
4
(2) Owner financers provide financing in lieu of 
5
the buyer choosing to obtain a loan from a bank. 
6
(3) The owner finance industry consists of 
7
small business owners who own real estate and pro-
8
vide financing on those properties to underserved 
9
buyers who cannot or would prefer not to obtain tra-
10
ditional bank or loan-based financing. 
11
(4) Owner financers are governed by real estate 
12
and consumer protection laws (including, but not 
13
limited to, ability to repay, deceptive trade practices, 
14
and usury laws) of each State, as well as State and 
15
Federal fair housing and equal opportunity laws. 
16
(5) Using owner financing will benefit home 
17
values, increase neighborhood stabilization, and as-
18
sist with family wealth creation through increased 
19
homeownership as more homes are sold with owner 
20
financing. 
21
(6) None of the amendments made by this Act 
22
are applicable to transactions known as Contracts 
23
for Deed or Land Installment Contracts, Lease Op-
24
tions, Lease with Option to Buy and Rent to Own.
