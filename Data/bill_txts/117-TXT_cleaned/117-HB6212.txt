SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress makes the following findings: 
2
(1) U.S. Customs and Border Protection 
3
Preclearance is the strategic stationing of CBP per-
4
sonnel at designated foreign locations to inspect 
5
travelers prior to boarding United States-bound 
6
flights, trains, ships, and ferries. With preclearance, 
7
travelers bypass Customs and Border Protection and 
8
Transportation Security Administration inspections 
9
upon United States arrival and proceed directly to 
10
their connecting flight or destination. 
11
(2) The preclearance program enhances the se-
12
curity of all travelers while facilitating efficient trade 
13
and travel. The program increases collaboration and 
14
coordination between the United States and host 
15
governments through daily interaction with local law 
16
enforcement partners and other government authori-
17
ties 
18
(3) More than 600 U.S. Customs and Border 
19
Protection officers and specialists are stationed in 
20
Aruba, The Bahamas, Bermuda, Canada, Ireland, 
21
and The United Arab Emirates. 
22
(4) A preclearance program at Taiwan’s 
23
Taoyuan International Airport (TPE) would signal 
24
Taiwan’s importance as a strategic security partner

to the United States and compliance with inter-
1
national aviation rules. 
2
(5) In 2012, the United States announced Tai-
3
wan’s designation for participation in the Visa Waiv-
4
er Program, which allows for Taiwanese passport 
5
holders to enter and remain in the United States for 
6
up to 90 days without obtaining a United States 
7
visa. 
8
(6) In 2017, Taiwan became the third location 
9
in East Asia and the 12th nation worldwide to be 
10
eligible for the Global Entry program, which allows 
11
for expedited immigration and customs clearance 
12
and pre-approval. 
13
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
14
It is the sense of Congress that— 
15
(1) Taiwan is a steadfast partner of the United 
16
States in the common pursuit of a free and open 
17
Indo-Pacific region; and 
18
(2) the United States should prioritize the es-
19
tablishment of preclearance facilities and other secu-
20
rity programs with allies and partners in the Indo- 
21
Pacific region, including Taiwan.
