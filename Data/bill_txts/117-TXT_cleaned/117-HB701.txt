•HR 701 IH
(1) The public has a right to know the benefits 
1
and costs of regulation. Effective regulatory pro-
2
grams provide important benefits to the public, in-
3
cluding protecting the environment, worker safety, 
4
and human health. Regulations also impose signifi-
5
cant costs on individuals, employers, and State, 
6
local, and Tribal governments, diverting resources 
7
from other important priorities. 
8
(2) Better regulatory analysis and review 
9
should improve the quality of agency decisions, in-
10
creasing the benefits and reducing unwarranted 
11
costs of regulation. 
12
(3) Disclosure and scrutiny of key information 
13
underlying agency decisions should make the Fed-
14
eral Government more accountable to the public it 
15
serves.
