A BILL 
To amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to 
establish nonvisual accessibility standards for certain de-
vices with digital interfaces, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Medical Device Non-
4
visual Accessibility Act of 2021’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Rapid advances in digital technology have 
8
led to increasingly complex user interfaces for every-

day products, such as life-sustaining medical devices 
1
and technologies. 
2
(2) Many of these new devices utilize displays 
3
that can only be operated visually and require user 
4
interaction with on-screen menus and other inter-
5
faces that are inaccessible to consumers who are 
6
blind or have low-vision. 
7
(3) Medical devices designed for use in the 
8
home are being increasingly utilized to lessen the 
9
cost of inpatient care for consumers. 
10
(4) Devices such as blood pressure monitors, 
11
sleep apnea machines, and in-home chemotherapy 
12
treatments generally lack nonvisual accessibility. 
13
(5) If a medical device is not accessible in a 
14
nonvisual manner, a blind or low-vision individual 
15
cannot use it safely. 
16
(6) Many technology companies have incor-
17
porated screen access technology functions into 
18
products developed and sold by such companies. 
19
(7) Screen access technology is not the only 
20
mechanism by which medical devices can be made 
21
accessible to blind or low-vision consumers. 
22
(8) Tactile markings, audible tones, or cost ef-
23
fective and widely available text-to-speech technology

may be sufficient to make such devices fully acces-
1
sible. 
2
(9) Devices that utilize these mechanisms will 
3
be more user-friendly in general by increasing meth-
4
ods for confirmation of readings, which has the po-
5
tential to lead to less waste and fewer mistakes. 
6
(10) Devices can be designed to work with non-
7
visual access technology used by individuals who are 
8
blind or have low-vision at little or no extra cost as 
9
long as such compatibility is taken into consider-
10
ation at the beginning of the design process. 
11
(11) Consumers who are blind or have low-vi-
12
sion must be able to operate medical devices in an 
13
equally effective and equally integrated manner and 
14
with equivalent ease of use as consumers without 
15
disabilities.

SEC. 3. NONVISUAL ACCESSIBILITY STANDARDS FOR CER-
17

16
bilitation Act of 1973), conduct training to educate manu-
17
facturers of a digital interface of a device described in sec-
