RESOLUTION 
Supporting the designation of March 2022 as National 
Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month. 
Whereas colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer 
among men and woman in the United States; 
Whereas colorectal cancer is the second leading combined 
cause of cancer death among men and women in the 
United States; 
Whereas the incidence—the number of new cancers per 
100,000—of colorectal cancer adenocarcinoma in adults 
between the ages of 40 to 49 years has increased by al-
most 15 percent from 2000–2002 to 2014–2016; 
Whereas in 2022, the American Cancer Society estimates 
that more than 151,030 Americans will be diagnosed

with colorectal cancer and approximately 52,580 Ameri-
cans will die from it; 
Whereas colorectal cancer is one of the most highly prevent-
able forms of cancer because of a growing number of 
more widely available screening tests that can detect pol-
yps that can be removed before becoming cancerous; 
Whereas colonoscopies, immunochemical tests, fecal-occult 
blood tests, and multi-target stool DNA tests screening 
tests can detect the presence of colorectal cancer early, 
when treatment works best; 
Whereas the most important predictor of colorectal cancer 
survival is stage at diagnosis and the relative survival 
rate for colorectal cancer is 64 percent at five years fol-
lowing diagnosis; 
Whereas The American Cancer Society and the US Preven-
tive Services Task Force now recommend individuals at 
average risk for colorectal cancer should begin regular 
screenings starting at age 45 and continue through age 
75; 
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention esti-
mates that if every individual aged 50 or older had reg-
ular screening tests, as many as 60 percent of deaths 
from colorectal cancer could be prevented; 
Whereas the 5-year survival rate for patients with localized 
colorectal cancer is 91 percent, but only 39 percent of all 
diagnoses occur at this stage; 
Whereas colorectal cancer screenings can effectively reduce 
colorectal cancer incidence and mortality, yet, 1 in 3 
adults over 50 years of age are not up to date with rec-
ommended colorectal cancer screening;

•HRES 958 IH 
Whereas the decrease in colorectal cancer diagnosis during 
the COVID–19 pandemic due in part to delayed or de-
ferred screening and testing deprives at-risk individuals 
from the benefits of early detection and intervention; 
Whereas the President’s Cancer Panel established in 1971 
when the National Cancer Act was signed by President 
Richard Nixon monitors the activities of the National 
Cancer Program and reports to the President of the 
United States on barriers to progress in reducing the 
burden of cancer; 
Whereas the President’s Cancer Panel has found that Black 
and American Indian/Alaska Native men are more likely 
to be diagnosed with or die from colorectal cancer than 
other populations; 
Whereas the President’s Cancer Panel has found that Black 
and American Indian/Alaska Native populations also are 
more likely to be diagnosed at a later stage of disease; 
Whereas public awareness and education campaigns on 
colorectal cancer prevention, screening, and symptoms 
are held during the month of March each year; and 
Whereas educational efforts can help provide information to 
the public of methods of prevention and screening, as 
well as about symptoms for early detection: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
