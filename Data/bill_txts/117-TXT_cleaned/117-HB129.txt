(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:

•HR 129 IH
(1) In recent years it has become clear that 
1
programs funded by the Edward Byrne Memorial 
2
Justice Assistance Grant program (referred to in 
3
this Act as the ‘‘Byrne grants program’’) have per-
4
petuated racial disparities, corruption in law enforce-
5
ment, and the commission of civil rights abuses 
6
across the country. This is especially the case when 
7
it comes to the program’s funding of hundreds of re-
8
gional antidrug task forces because the grants for 
9
these antidrug task forces have been dispensed to 
10
State governments with very little Federal oversight 
11
and have been prone to misuse and corruption. 
12
(2) Numerous Government Accountability Of-
13
fice reports have found that the Department of Jus-
14
tice has inadequately monitored grants provided 
15
under the Byrne grants program. A 2001 General 
16
Accounting Office report found that one-third of the 
17
grants did not contain required monitoring plans. 
18
Seventy percent of files on such grants did not con-
19
tain required progress reports. Forty-one percent of 
20
such files did not contain financial reports covering 
21
the full grant period. A 2002 report by the Heritage 
22
Foundation reported that ‘‘there is virtually no evi-
23
dence’’ that the Byrne grants program has been suc-
24

•HR 129 IH
cessful in reducing crime and that the program lacks 
1
‘‘adequate measures of performance’’. 
2
(3) A 2002 report by the American Civil Lib-
3
erties Union of Texas identified 17 recent scandals 
4
involving antidrug task forces in Texas that receive 
5
funds under the Byrne grants program. Such scan-
6
dals include cases of the falsification of government 
7
records, witness tampering, fabricating evidence, 
8
false imprisonment, stealing drugs from evidence 
9
lockers, selling drugs to children, large-scale racial 
10
profiling, sexual harassment, and other abuses of of-
11
ficial capacity. Recent scandals in other States in-
12
clude the misuse of millions of dollars in Byrne 
13
grants program money in Kentucky and Massachu-
14
setts, wrongful convictions based on police perjury in 
15
Missouri, and negotiations with drug offenders to 
16
drop or lower their charges in exchange for money 
17
or vehicles in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Massa-
18
chusetts, New York, Ohio, and Wisconsin. 
19
(4) The most well-known Byrne-funded task 
20
force scandal occurred in Tulia, Texas, where dozens 
21
of African-American residents (totaling over 16 per-
22
cent of the town’s African-American population) 
23
were arrested, prosecuted, and sentenced to decades 
24
in prison, based solely on the uncorroborated testi-
25

mony of one undercover officer whose background 
1
included past allegations of misconduct, sexual har-
2
assment, unpaid debts, and habitual use of a racial 
3
epithet. The undercover officer was allowed to work 
4
alone, and not required to provide audiotapes, video 
5
surveillance, or eyewitnesses to corroborate his alle-
6
gations. Despite the lack of physical evidence or cor-
7
roboration, the charges were vigorously prosecuted. 
8
After the first few trials resulted in convictions and 
9
lengthy sentences, many defendants accepted plea 
10
bargains. Suspicions regarding the legitimacy of the 
11
charges eventually arose after two of the accused de-
12
fendants were able to produce convincing alibi evi-
13
dence to prove that they were out of State or at 
14
work at the time of the alleged drug purchases. 
15
Texas Governor Rick Perry eventually pardoned the 
16
Tulia defendants (after four years of imprisonment), 
17
but these kinds of scandals continue to plague Byrne 
18
grant program spending. 
19
(5) A case arose in a Federal court in Waco, 
20
Texas, concerning the wrongful arrests of 28 African 
21
Americans out of 4,500 other residents of Hearne, 
22
Texas. In November 2000, these individuals were ar-
23
rested on charges of possession or distribution of 
24
crack cocaine, and they subsequently filed a case 
25
20:58 Jan 28, 2021

•HR 129 IH
against the county government. On May 11, 2005, 
1
a magistrate judge found sufficient evidence that a 
2
Byrne-funded antidrug task force had routinely tar-
3
geted African Americans to hold the county liable 
4
for the harm suffered by the plaintiffs. Plaintiffs in 
5
that lawsuit alleged that for the past 15 years, based 
6
on the uncorroborated tales of informants, task force 
7
members annually raided the African-American com-
8
munity in eastern Hearne to arrest the residents 
9
identified by the confidential informants, resulting in 
10
the arrest and prosecution of innocent citizens with-
11
out cause. On the eve of trial the counties involved 
12
in the Hearne task force scandal settled the case, 
13
agreeing to pay financial damages to the plaintiffs. 
14
(6) Scandals related to the Byrne grants pro-
15
gram have grown so prolific that the Texas legisla-
16
ture has passed several reforms in response to them, 
17
including outlawing racial profiling and changing 
18
Texas law to prohibit drug offense convictions based 
19
solely on the word of an undercover informant. The 
20
Criminal Jurisprudence Committee of the Texas 
21
House of Representatives issued a report in 2004 
22
recommending that all of the State’s federally fund-
23
ed antidrug task forces be abolished because they 
24
are inherently prone to corruption. The Committee 
25
20:58 Jan 28, 2021

•HR 129 IH
reported, ‘‘Continuing to sanction task force oper-
1
ations as stand-alone law enforcement entities—with 
2
widespread authority to operate at will across mul-
3
tiple jurisdictional lines—should not continue. The 
4
current approach violates practically every sound 
5
principle of police oversight and accountability appli-
6
cable to narcotics interdiction.’’ The Texas legisla-
7
ture passed a law that ends the ability of a narcotics 
8
task force to operate as an entity with no clear ac-
9
countability. The legislation transfers authority for 
10
multicounty drug task forces to the Department of 
11
Public Safety and channels one-quarter of asset for-
12
feiture proceeds received by the task forces to a spe-
13
cial fund to support drug abuse prevention pro-
14
grams, drug treatment, and other programs de-
15
signed to reduce drug use in the county where the 
16
assets are seized. 
17
(7) Texas’s ‘‘corroboration’’ law was passed 
18
thanks to a coalition of Christian conservatives and 
19
civil rights activists. As one Texas preacher related, 
20
requiring corroboration ‘‘puts a protective hedge 
21
around the ninth commandment, ‘You shall not bear 
22
false witness against your neighbor.’ As long as peo-
23
ple bear false witness against their neighbors, this 
24
Biblical law will not be outdated.’’

•HR 129 IH
(8) During floor debate, conservative Texas leg-
1
islators pointed out that Mosaic law requires cor-
2
roboration: ‘‘One witness shall not rise up against a 
3
man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that 
4
he sinneth: at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the 
5
mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be estab-
6
lished.’’ Deuteronomy 19:15. Jesus concurred with 
7
the corroboration rule: ‘‘If thy brother shall trespass 
8
against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee 
9
and him alone. . . . But if he will not hear thee, 
10
then take with thee one or two more, that in the 
11
mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be 
12
established.’’ Matthew 18:15–16. 
13
(9) Texas’s ‘‘corroboration’’ law had an imme-
14
diate positive impact. Once prosecutors needed more 
15
than just the word of one person to convict someone 
16
of a drug offense they began scrutinizing law en-
17
forcement tactics. This new scrutiny led to the un-
18
covering of massive corruption and civil rights abuse 
19
by the Dallas police force. In what became known 
20
nationally as the ‘‘Sheetrock’’ scandal, Dallas police 
21
officers and undercover informants were found to 
22
have set up dozens of innocent people, mostly Mexi-
23
can immigrants, by planting fake drugs on them 
24
consisting of chalk-like material used in sheetrock 
25

•HR 129 IH
and other brands of wallboard. The revelations led 
1
to the dismissal of over 40 cases (although some of 
2
those arrested were already deported). In April 
3
2005, a former Dallas narcotics detective was sen-
4
tenced to five years in prison for his role in the 
5
scheme. Charges against others are pending. 
6
(10) Many regional antidrug task forces receive 
7
up to 75 percent of their funding from the Byrne 
8
grant program. As such, the United States Govern-
9
ment is accountable for corruption and civil rights 
10
abuses inherent in their operation. 
11
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
12
gress that— 
13
(1) grants under the Byrne grants program 
14
should be prohibited for States that do not exercise 
15
effective control over antidrug task forces; 
16
(2) at a minimum, no State that fails to pro-
17
hibit criminal convictions based solely on the testi-
18
mony of a law enforcement officer or informants 
19
should receive a grant under such program; and 
20
(3) corroborative evidence, such as video or 
21
audio tapes, drugs, and money, should always be re-
22
quired for such criminal convictions to be sustained.
