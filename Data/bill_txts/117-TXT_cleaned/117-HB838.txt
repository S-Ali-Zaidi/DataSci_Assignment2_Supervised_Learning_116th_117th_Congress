disabilities, guaranteed by the Rehabilitation Act of 
1
1973 (29 U.S.C. 701 et seq.) and the Individuals 
2
with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1400 et 
3
seq.). 
4
(2) More than 7,000,000 school-aged children 
5
with disabilities, approximately 13 percent of the 
6
total student enrollment, are currently entitled to in-
7
dividualized education and related services mandated 
8
by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. 
9
(3) Nearly 500,000 infants and toddlers, as 
10
well as their families, receive supports and services 
11
under the Individuals with Disabilities Education 
12
Act and these early interventions have been proven 
13
to improve education outcomes. 
14
(4) Under the Individuals with Disabilities Edu-
15
cation Act, schools and lead agencies responsible for 
16
the administration of funds under part C of the In-
17
dividuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 
18
1431 et seq.) (referred to in this Act as ‘‘lead agen-
19
cies’’) are required to provide early intervention, spe-
20
cial education, and related services to children with 
21
disabilities, an obligation that requires services out-
22
lined in a child’s individualized family service plan 
23
(referred to as an ‘‘IFSP’’) or individualized edu-
24
cation program (referred to as an ‘‘IEP’’).

(5) Children with disabilities have been dis-
1
proportionately impacted by the disruptions to edu-
2
cation resulting from the COVID–19 pandemic, with 
3
many children with disabilities needing additional 
4
supports and services to meet their IEP and IFSP 
5
goals as the delivery of education and services has 
6
shifted from in-person to remote formats. 
7
(6) Local educational agencies and lead agen-
8
cies face extra costs associated with adjusting serv-
9
ices and continuing to provide a free, appropriate 
10
public education while children with disabilities are 
11
receiving services through distance learning and re-
12
mote service delivery. 
13
(7) Schools are facing unprecedented budget 
14
challenges due to the rising costs of responding to 
15
COVID–19, coupled with State and local revenue 
16
shortfalls, as well as the severe and persistent under-
17
funding of the Individuals with Disabilities Edu-
18
cation Act. 
19
(8) To ensure that schools and lead agencies 
20
continue to meet the needs of children with disabil-
21
ities and their families, including providing trained 
22
and certified special educators and education sup-
23
port specialists, emergency supplemental funding is 
24

needed under the Individuals with Disabilities Edu-
1
cation Act. 
2
(9) Emergency supplemental funding is also 
3
needed under the Assistive Technology Act of 1998 
4
(29 U.S.C. 3001 et seq.) because services provided 
5
under that Act help ensure that students with dis-
6
abilities have the technology devices and services 
7
they need to access equal educational opportunities.
