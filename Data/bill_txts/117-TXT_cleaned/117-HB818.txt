SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Most Americans, including most children 
3
and adolescents, consume on average only about half 
4
of the recommended amounts of dairy foods daily. 
5
(2) Milk is a source of many nutrients essential 
6
to health, and is the leading source of and is a 
7
source of twelve essential nutrients (calcium, phos-
8
phorus, vitamin A, vitamin D (in fortified products), 
9
riboflavin, vitamin B12, protein, potassium, zinc, 
10
choline, magnesium, and selenium) in the diets of 
11
children and adolescents, including three nutrients 
12
of public health concern: vitamin D, calcium, and 
13
potassium. 
14
(3) Dairy foods are associated with improved 
15
bone health, a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, a bene-
16
ficial or neutral effect on blood pressure, and may 
17
help reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, coro-
18
nary heart disease, and stroke.

20

nized that there has been recent research and

healthy dietary patterns but in the absence of 
11
clear evidence justifying a departure from cur-
12
rent recommendations, such expert panel chose 
13
to remain consistent with current guidance rec-
14
ommending whole milk for most children ages 
15
12 to 24 months and fat-free (skim) or low-fat 
16
(1 percent) milk for children ages 2 years and
