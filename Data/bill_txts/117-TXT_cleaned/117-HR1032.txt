RESOLUTION 
Supporting the designation of April 2022 as the ‘‘Month 
of the Military Child’’. 
Whereas thousands of brave Americans have demonstrated 
their courage and commitment to freedom by serving the 
Armed Forces of the United States of America in active- 
duty posts in Afghanistan, Iraq, and around the world; 
Whereas there are more than 1,600,000 children connected to 
the military across the United States; 
Whereas it is only fitting that we take time to recognize their 
contributions, celebrate their spirit, and let our men and 
women in uniform know that while they are taking care 
of us, we are taking care of their children and youth;

•HRES 1032 IH 
Whereas the recognition of a ‘‘Month of the Military Child’’ 
will allow us to pay tribute to military children and youth 
for their commitment, their struggles, and their uncondi-
tional support of our troops because when someone joins 
the military, it’s a family commitment to our country, 
military children are heroes in their own way; and 
Whereas a monthlong salute to military children and youth 
will encourage our country to provide direct support to 
military children and families: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports a ‘‘Month of the Military Child’’; 
2
and 
3
(2) urges all citizens, business, and government 
4
leaders to observe the month with appropriate cere-
5
monies and activities that honor, support, and show 
6
appreciation for military children.
