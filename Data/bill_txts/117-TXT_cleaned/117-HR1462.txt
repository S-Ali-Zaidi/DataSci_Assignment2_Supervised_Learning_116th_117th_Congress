RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for designating November 2022 as 
‘‘National Career Development Month’’. 
Whereas November 2022 marks the 109th year that the Na-
tional Career Development Association is committed to 
its mission of inspiring and empowering individuals to 
achieve their career and life goals; 
Whereas a competitive global economy requires workers who 
make informed career choices to prepare for skilled pro-

sure gainful employment best utilizing one’s skills and 
talent, while providing potential employers with a well-

prepared workforce ready to meet the challenges of the 
global marketplace; 
Whereas career development programs enable students to 
gain a realistic understanding of how formal education 
prepares them for post-high school plans, which may in-
clude immediate employment in a civilian or military oc-
cupation, or further education at a vocational program, 
community college, or university; 
Whereas career development activities in our communities 
contribute to lower unemployment as people identify ca-
reers that match their interests and desired work envi-
ronments; 
Whereas freedom of occupational and career choice is one of 
the most important birthrights of every United States cit-
izen, and this freedom will be protected and enhanced 
throughout life; 
Whereas professional career development assistance, includ-
ing career counseling, should be available to all persons 
throughout their lifespans; 
Whereas career development assistance is a community part-
nership effort involving the education system, the home 
and family structure, business, industry, and a wide vari-
ety of community agencies and organizations, and is not 
carried out by career development professionals alone; 
Whereas equity, not just equality, of career development op-
portunities should be available for all persons; 
Whereas the right to change occupations or career directions 
is fully as important as the right to choose an occupation 
or career direction; 
Whereas accurate, up-to-date information about educational 
and occupational opportunities is vital;

Whereas helping individuals increase self-understanding of 
their abilities, interests, values, and goals is a vital foun-
dation of the career development process; 
Whereas career professionals help to provide career develop-
ment services to inspire and empower our citizens’ atten-
tion to where it is needed most: empowering the national 
economy through maximum individual productivity; 
Whereas, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, as of 
September 2022, 5,750,000 workers are unemployed; 
Whereas career professionals help the United States worker 
meet the very real and immediate challenges of economic 
development, student achievement, and global competi-
tiveness; 
Whereas career professionals are a vital resource for the live-
lihood of our Nation’s workforce and are underutilized 
relative to their potential need and value; 
Whereas a Harris Interactive Poll, conducted in partnership 
with the National Career Development Association, exam-
ined the perceptions of today’s workforce on the effective-
ness of career counselors, the need for expanded work-
force training opportunities, and the hardships implicit in 
selecting, changing, or getting a job in the current eco-
nomic climate, and the feedback is very clear; and 
Whereas the 2021 Harris Interactive Poll results revealed 
that— 
(1) only 13 percent of adults report that they had 
worked with a career specialist such as a school or pri-
vate counselor, but 85 percent of Americans find profes-
sional career development assistance valuable; and
