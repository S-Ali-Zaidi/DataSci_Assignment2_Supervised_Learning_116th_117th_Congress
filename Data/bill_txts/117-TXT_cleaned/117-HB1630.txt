•HR 1630 IH
(1) The Government of the People’s Republic of 
1
China has a long history of repressing Turkic Mus-
2
lims and other Muslim minority groups, particularly 
3
Uyghurs, in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region 
4
(‘‘Xinjiang’’ or ‘‘XUAR’’), also known as East 
5
Turkestan. Central and regional Chinese government 
6
policies have systematically discriminated against 
7
these minority groups by denying them a range of 
8
civil and political rights, particularly freedom of reli-
9
gion. 
10
(2) In May 2014, the Government of the Peo-
11
ple’s Republic of China launched its latest ‘‘Strike 
12
Hard Against Violent Extremism’’ campaign, using 
13
wide-scale, internationally linked threats of terrorism 
14
as a pretext to justify pervasive restrictions on and 
15
serious human rights violations against members of 
16
ethnic minority communities in Xinjiang. The Au-
17
gust 2016 appointment of former Tibet Autonomous 
18
Region Party Secretary Chen Quanguo to be Party 
19
Secretary of the XUAR accelerated the crackdown 
20
across the region. Scholars, human rights organiza-
21
tions, journalists, and think tanks have provided 
22
ample evidence substantiating the establishment by 
23
the Government of the People’s Republic of China of 
24
internment camps. Since 2017, the Government of 
25
02:25 May 05, 2021

•HR 1630 IH
the People’s Republic of China has detained more 
1
than 1,000,000 Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, 
2
and members of other Muslim minority groups in 
3
these camps. The total ethnic minority population of 
4
Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region was approxi-
5
mately 13,000,000 at the time of the last census 
6
conducted by the People’s Republic of China in 
7
2010. 
8
(3) The Government of the People’s Republic of 
9
China’s actions against Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs, 
10
Kyrgyz, and members of other Muslim minority 
11
groups in Xinjiang violate international human 
12
rights laws and norms, including— 
13
(A) the International Convention on the 
14
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimina-
15
tion, to which the People’s Republic of China 
16
has acceded; 
17
(B) the Convention against Torture and 
18
Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment 
19
or Punishment, which the People’s Republic of 
20
China has signed and ratified; 
21
(C) The Convention on the Prevention and 
22
Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, which 
23
the People’s Republic of China has signed and

ratified;

(D) the International Covenant on Civil

and Political Rights, which the People’s Repub-
2
lic of China has signed; and

(E) the Universal Declaration of Human 
4
Rights and the International Labor Organiza-
5
tion’s Force Labor Convention (no. 29) and the 
6
Abolition of Forced Labor Convention (no.

8
(4) Senior Chinese Communist Party officials 
9
bear direct responsibility for gross human rights vio-
10
lations committed against Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs, 
11
Kyrgyz, and members of other Muslim minority 
12
groups. These abuses include the arbitrary detention 
13
of more than 1,000,000 Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs, 
14
Kyrgyz, and members of other Muslim minority 
15
groups, separation of working age adults from their 
16
children and elderly parents, and the integration of 
17
forced labor into supply chains. 
18
(5) Those held in detention facilities and intern-
19
ment camps in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous 
20
Region have described forced political indoctrination, 
21
torture, beatings, food deprivation, sexual assault, 
22
coordinated campaigns to reduce birth rates among 
23
Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims through forced 
24
sterilization, and denial of religious, cultural, and

linguistic freedoms. These victims have confirmed 
1
they were told by guards that the only way to secure 
2
their release was to demonstrate adequate political 
3
loyalty. Poor conditions and lack of medical treat-
4
ment at such facilities appear to have contributed to 
5
the deaths of some detainees, including the elderly 
6
and infirm. Recent media reports indicate that since 
7
2019 the Government of the People’s Republic of 
8
China has newly constructed, expanded, or fortified 
9
at least 60 detention facilities with higher security 
10
or prison-like features. 
11
(6) In September 2018, United Nations High 
12
Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet 
13
noted ‘‘the deeply disturbing allegations of large- 
14
scale arbitrary detentions of Uighurs and other Mus-
15
lim communities, in so-called reeducation camps 
16
across Xinjiang’’. 
17
(7) In 2019, the Congressional-Executive Com-
18
mission on China concluded that, based on available 
19
evidence, the establishment and actions committed in 
20
the internment camps in Xinjiang Uyghur Autono-
21
mous Region may constitute ‘‘crimes against human-
22
ity’’.
