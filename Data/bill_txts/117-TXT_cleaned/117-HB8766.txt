SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
1
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The Strategic Petroleum Reserve was cre-
3
ated through the Energy Policy and Conservation 
4
Act (42 U.S.C. 6231 et seq.) to address ‘‘severe en-
5
ergy supply interruptions’’ and provided the execu-
6
tive branch authority to draw down these reserves 
7
provided that specific conditions are met. 
8
(2) According to the U.S. Energy Information 
9
Administration’s Annual Energy Outlook 2022, pe-
10
troleum and natural gas will remain the most-con-
11
sumed sources of energy in the United States 
12
through 2050. 
13
(3) As of August 19, 2022, the Strategic Petro-
14
leum Reserve fell to 453.1 million barrels, from a 
15
maximum capacity of 714 million barrels, which is 
16
the lowest level since 1985. 
17
(4) Emergency sales in 2022 from the Strategic 
18
Petroleum Reserve were purchased by Unipec, a 
19
subsidiary of Chinese oil giant Sinopec, and deliv-
20
ered to the People’s Republic of China, the principle 
21
strategic competitor to the United States. 
22
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
23
gress that— 
24
(1) continuing to limit energy production in the 
25
United States will only provide further leverage and 
26

funding for our adversaries and continue to weaken 
1
global security; and 
2
(2) the energy independence of the United 
3
States is critical to national security and should in-
4
clude the production of all available energy sources, 
5
including coal, natural gas, oil, nuclear, and renew-
6
ables, as well as strategic minerals critical to electric 
7
vehicles and other clean energy sources.

(a) STUDIES AND ASSESSMENT.— 
11
(1) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 1 year after 
12
the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of

15

17
(A) the results of a study of metrics that 
18
may be used for determining the adequacy of 
19
the amounts of petroleum products stored in 
20
the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to support 
21
United States energy security objectives, taking 
22
into consideration gross crude oil imports, net 
23
crude oil imports, and refining capacity and uti-
24
lization, and a determination of which such

metrics are the most appropriate for such pur-
1
pose; 
2
(B) the results of a study and analysis of 
3
domestic crude oil refining capacity (including 
4
technical configuration of refineries, down-
5
stream charge capacity, and atmospheric crude 
6
distillation units) and issues relating to aging 
7
infrastructure that would inhibit the ability to 
8
meet production demand, and any recommenda-
9
tions for improvements; and 
10
(C) an assessment of acquisition proce-
11
dures and identification of any provisions of 
12
Federal law or regulation that either limit or 
13
prohibit accelerated replenishment of the Stra-
14
tegic Petroleum Reserve necessary to maintain 
15
and support United States energy security ob-
16
