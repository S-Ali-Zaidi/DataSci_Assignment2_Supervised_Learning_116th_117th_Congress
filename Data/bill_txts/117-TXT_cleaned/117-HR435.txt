RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the 100th Anniversary of the 1921 Tulsa Race 
Massacre. 
Whereas, in the early 1900s, many Black individuals and 
families settled throughout Oklahoma, setting up vibrant 
communities and dozens of all-Black towns. These indi-
viduals came looking for new opportunities, freedom, and 
a chance for a better life; 
Whereas the most famous and prosperous of these Black 
communities was in Tulsa’s Greenwood District; 
Whereas O.W. Gurley, a wealthy Black business owner, 
moved to Tulsa in 1906 and purchased tracts of land

1
Massacre was the worst race massacre in the history 
2
of the United States; 
3

4
massacre in the history of the United States, several 
5
hundred Black residents of the Greenwood District 
6

7
night, and the most prosperous Black community in

the United States was decimated;

14
such as the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre Centennial

18
curately told and remembered;

(5) believes that while significant progress has 
20
been made in the 100 years since the 1921 Tulsa

for, people of different races;

the areas where more work is needed;
