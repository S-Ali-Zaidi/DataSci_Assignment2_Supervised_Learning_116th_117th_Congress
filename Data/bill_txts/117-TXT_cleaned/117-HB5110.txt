•HR 5110 IH
(1) Oral and general healths are inseparable, 
1
and good dental care is critical to our overall phys-
2
ical health and well-being. 
3
(2) A 1999 Institute of Medicine study found 
4
that the prevention and management of oral infec-
5
tion have significant health implications when such 
6
infection has the potential to increase morbidity in 
7
Medicare patients who are at risk of adverse out-
8
comes from underlying health problems. 
9
(3) Improved oral health care may reduce mor-
10
tality and morbidity rates of Medicare patients suf-
11
fering from head and neck cancer, leukemia, 
12
lymphoma, organ transplantation, and heart valve 
13
disease. 
14
(4) The Medicare program, from its inception, 
15
has excluded coverage for services in connection with 
16
the care, treatment, filling, removal, or replacement 
17
of teeth or structures directly supporting the teeth. 
18
(5) The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Serv-
19
ices has approved coverage exceptions for limited 
20
dental services and proposed additional exceptions 
21
based on the argument that oral health services 
22
would reduce the risk of infection and other com-
23
plications of medical care.

(6) The Institute of Medicine study concluded 
1
that it is reasonable for Congress to update the stat-
2
utory language relating to coverage of dental serv-
3
ices for Medicare beneficiaries so that it clearly cov-
4
ers dental care that is effective in preventing or re-
5
ducing oral and systemic complications associated 
6
with serious medical conditions and treatments.
