RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the Congress that the Parthenon 
Marbles should be returned to Greece. 
Whereas the Parthenon was built on the hill of the Acropolis 
in Athens, Greece, in the mid-fifth century B.C. under 
the direction of the Athenian statesman Pericles and the 
design of the sculptor Phidias; 
Whereas the Parthenon is the ultimate expression of the ar-
tistic genius of Greece, the preeminent symbol of the 
Greek cultural heritage, including its art, architecture, 
and democracy, and of the contributions that modern 
Greeks and their forefathers have made to civilization; 
Whereas the Parthenon has served as a place of worship for 
ancient Greeks, Christians, and Muslims;

Whereas the Parthenon has been adopted by imitation by the 
United States in many preeminent public buildings, in-
cluding the Lincoln Memorial; 
Whereas over 100 pieces of the Parthenon’s sculptures, now 
known as the Parthenon Marbles, were removed from the 
Parthenon under questionable circumstances between 
1801 and 1816 by British nobleman Thomas Bruce, sev-
enth Earl of Elgin, while Greece was still under Ottoman 
rule; 
Whereas the removal of the Parthenon Marbles, including 
their perilous voyage to Great Britain and their careless 
storage there for many years, greatly endangered the 
Marbles; 
Whereas the Parthenon Marbles were removed to grace the 
private home of Lord Elgin, who transferred the Marbles 
to the British Museum only after severe personal eco-
nomic misfortunes; 
Whereas the sculptures of the Parthenon were designed as an 
integral part of the structure of the Parthenon temple, 
the carvings of the friezes, pediments, and metopes are 
not merely statuary, movable decorative art, but are inte-
gral arts of the Parthenon, which can best be appreciated 
if all the Parthenon Marbles are reunified; 
Whereas the Parthenon is a universal symbol of culture, de-
mocracy, and freedom, making the Parthenon Marbles of 
concern not only to Greece but to all the world; 
Whereas, since obtaining independence in 1830, Greece has 
sought the return of the Parthenon Marbles; 
Whereas the return of the Parthenon Marbles would be a 
profound demonstration by the United Kingdom of its

appreciation and respect for the Parthenon and classical 
art; 
Whereas returning the Parthenon Marbles to Greece would be 
a gesture of good will on the part of the British Par-
liament, and would set no legal precedent, nor in any 
other way affect the ownership or disposition of other ob-
jects in museums in the United States or around the 
world; 
Whereas the United Kingdom should return the Parthenon 
Marbles in recognition that the Parthenon is part of the 
cultural heritage of the entire world and, as such, should 
be made whole; 
Whereas Greece would provide care for the Parthenon Mar-
bles equal or superior to the care provided by the British 
Museum, especially considering the irreparable harm 
caused by attempts by the museum to remove the original 
color and patina of the Marbles with abrasive cleaners; 
Whereas Greece opened the New Acropolis Museum in 2009 
which houses the Marbles that were not removed to the 
United Kingdom by Lord Elgin and displays them along-
side plaster replicas of the Marbles currently in the Brit-
ish Museum so visitors can see the entire frieze as it was 
designed around the Temple of Athena; 
Whereas it has been 200 years since the British Government 
voted to purchase the Marbles; 
Whereas the Greek Government has publicly supported work-
ing with the British Government in a diplomatic manner 
to negotiate mutually agreeable conditions for the return 
of the Parthenon Marbles; 
Whereas the people of Greece have a greater, ancient bond 
to the Parthenon Marbles, which were in Greece for over

2,200 years of the over 2,430-year history of the Par-
thenon; and 
Whereas British Members of Parliament across the political 
spectrum have supported legislation to authorize the re-
turn of the Marbles to Greece: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Congress that 
1
the Government of the United Kingdom should enter into 
2
negotiations with the Government of Greece to facilitate 
3
return of the Parthenon Marbles to Greece.
