Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

Congress finds the following:

•HR 816 IH
(1) As the Nation continues to feel the dev-
1
astating economic impacts of Coronavirus Disease 
2
2019 (COVID-19), many urban and rural commu-
3
nities are still suffering from the effects of under-
4
water mortgages, vacancy, abandoned properties, 
5
blight, aging housing stock, properties with deferred 
6
maintenance and harmful materials such as lead, as-
7
bestos, and mold, unemployment, and population 
8
loss. 
9
(2) While some cities and counties struggle with 
10
disinvestment and population loss, there are also 
11
pockets of economic distress in otherwise prosperous, 
12
growing areas. 
13
(3) Investments targeted to these communities 
14
left behind will be critical to ensure equitable eco-
15
nomic recovery, job creation, and housing and neigh-
16
borhood infrastructure revitalization. 
17
(4) The need to revitalize neighborhoods is 
18
greater than what can be supported with existing 
19
local tax bases. 
20
(5) Communities continue to suffer from the 
21
impact of governmental policies and private sector 
22
practices that forbade or discouraged mortgage lend-
23
ing in neighborhoods having significant minority 
24
populations. 
25
17:38 Feb 24, 2021

•HR 816 IH
(6) Many State and local governments, land 
1
banks, and nonprofit organizations across the 
2
United States have responded to the housing crisis 
3
by creating cost-effective strategies to revitalize 
4
neighborhoods. 
5
(7) 2016 data from the United States Census 
6
Bureau shows that non-Hispanic, White households 
7
have an average net worth of $143,600, while Black 
8
households have an average net worth of $12,920, 
9
and Hispanic households have an average net worth 
10
of $21,420. 
11
(8) Housing equity is a significant portion of 
12
Black and Hispanic households’ net worth, making 
13
up nearly 57 percent of Black households’ net worth, 
14
66.5 percent of Hispanic households’ net worth, and 
15
40.8 percent of White households’ net worth, accord-
16
ing to the Urban Institute’s calculations from the 
17
2016 Survey of Consumer Finances. 
18
(9) The 2008 Great Recession and the COVID- 
19
19 Recession have exacerbated the racial wealth gap. 
20
(10) Funding innovative local neighborhood 
21
strategies will allow the United States to close the 
22
racial wealth gap, ensure equitable access to housing 
23
and economic mobility, and counter the lasting leg-
24
acy of redlining policies.

(11) Despite the strong requirement to affirma-
1
tively furthering fair housing under the Fair Hous-
2
ing Act, the lack of accountability measures imple-
3
mented by the Department of Housing and Urban 
4
Development to ensure equitable use of housing and 
5
community development dollars in Federal programs 
6
has allowed for the perpetuation of the legacy of red-
7
lining and neighborhood disinvestment. 
8
(12) It is imperative that the Federal Govern-
9
ment make funding available for the best local strat-
10
egies to increase homeownership and preserve home 
11
equity in impacted areas, access to safe and afford-
12
able rental housing, economic growth, job creation, 
13
and to build on local assets to improve communities 
14
in ways that affirmatively further fair housing.
