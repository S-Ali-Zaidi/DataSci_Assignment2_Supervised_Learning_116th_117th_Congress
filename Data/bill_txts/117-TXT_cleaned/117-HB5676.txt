(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:

•HR 5676 IH
(1) Over the course of an 8-year-period fol-
1
lowing the release of individuals from Federal pris-
2
ons, the United States Sentencing Commission 
3
found that 49.3 percent of such individuals were re-
4
arrested, 31.7 percent were reconvicted, and 24.6 
5
percent were reincarcerated. 
6
(2) The Bureau of Justice Statistics found that 
7
over a similar time period as described in paragraph 
8
(1), 83 percent of people released from State prisons 
9
were rearrested. 
10
(3) A broad spectrum of prison education pro-
11
gramming can prepare individuals for the contem-
12
porary workforce pre-release, ensuring that upon re-
13
lease the individuals are best situated to be produc-
14
tive members of their communities. 
15
(4) Education for people in prisons has a clear 
16
public safety benefit, reducing recidivism rates by 
17
over 43 percent. 
18
(5) Employment is 13 percent higher for indi-
19
viduals who participated in either academic or voca-
20
tional programs in prison, and 28 percent higher for 
21
individuals who participated in vocational programs 
22
alone. 
23
(6) During the first 3 years after an individual 
24
is released, each dollar spent on funding prison edu-

•HR 5676 IH
cation programs reduces incarceration costs by 4 to 
1
5 dollars. 
2
(7) Prison education helps to improve the safety 
3
of the prison environment, not only for incarcerated 
4
individuals, but also for correctional officers and 
5
prison staff. 
6
(8) A 2016 analysis of the Bureau of Prisons 
7
education programs found that the Bureau of Pris-
8
ons spends 20 percent as much on inmate education 
9
as the nearest-sized State prison systems and experi-
10
ences a proportionally low return. 
11
(9) The 2016 analysis described in paragraph 
12
(8) also found that the Bureau of Prisons lacked the 
13
staff, programmatic strategy and alignment, budget, 
14
assessment, and educational support to effectively 
15
administer educational programs. 
16
(b) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act is to create 
17
a dedicated office within the Bureau of Prisons to— 
18
(1) improve the prison education programs pro-
19
vided by the Bureau of Prisons; 
20
(2) ensure access to quality education programs 
21
across all Federal penal and correctional institu-
22
tions;

(3) create partnerships with education providers 
24
to offer quality programs; and
