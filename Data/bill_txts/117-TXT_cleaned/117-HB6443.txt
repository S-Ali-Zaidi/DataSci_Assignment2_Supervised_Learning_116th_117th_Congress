SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
1
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following find-
2
ings: 
3
(1) The Department of Defense has warned 
4
that the Government of the People’s Republic of 
5
China may conclude that it can successfully invade 
6
and seize control of Taiwan in the latter half of the 
7
2020s. 
8
(2) In October 2021, the Minister of National 
9
Defense of Taiwan, Chiu Kuo-cheng, echoed these 
10
warnings when he stated that the People’s Republic 
11
of China— 
12
(A) ‘‘is capable now’’ of invading Taiwan; 
13
and 
14
(B) will have ‘‘lowered the costs and 
15
losses’’ associated with invading Taiwan ‘‘to a 
16
minimum’’ after 2025. 
17
(3) If the People’s Republic of China were to 
18
invade and seize control of Taiwan, it would deal a 
19
severe blow to United States interests by— 
20
(A) destroying one of the world’s leading 
21
democracies; 
22
(B) casting doubt on the ability and re-
23
solve of the United States to uphold its security 
24
commitments; 
25
03:28 Jan 22, 2022
H6443

•HR 6443 IH
(C) incentivizing other countries in the 
1
Indo-Pacific region to bandwagon with the Peo-
2
ple’s Republic of China; and 
3
(D) facilitating the formation of a regional 
4
order dominated by the People’s Republic of 
5
China in which the Government of the People’s 
6
Republic of China may— 
7
(i) regulate or otherwise limit the abil-
8
ity of individuals in the United States to 
9
trade in the Indo-Pacific region, which 
10
would have dire effects on the livelihoods 
11
and freedoms of such individuals; and 
12
(ii) use the Indo-Pacific region as a 
13
secure base from which to project military 
14
power into other regions, including the 
15
Western Hemisphere. 
16
(4) Taiwan’s proximity to the People’s Republic 
17
of China, coupled with investments by the People’s 
18
Republic of China in capabilities designed to delay 
19
intervention by the United States Armed Forces in 
20
support of Taiwan, means that Taiwan may be 
21
forced to delay, degrade, and deny an invasion by 
22
the People’s Republic of China with limited support 
23
from the United States Armed Forces for the initial 
24
days, weeks, or months of such an invasion. 
25

•HR 6443 IH
(5) If Taiwan is unable to delay, degrade, and 
1
deny an invasion by the People’s Republic of China 
2
with limited support from the United States Armed 
3
Forces, especially in the initial period of war, then 
4
the People’s Republic of China may conclude that it 
5
is, or may actually be, capable of— 
6
(A) invading and seizing control of Taiwan 
7
before the United States or any other partner 
8
country of Taiwan is able to respond effectively, 
9
thereby achieving a fait accompli; and 
10
(B) potentially rendering any attempt by 
11
the United States or any other partner country 
12
of Taiwan to reverse territorial gains by the 
13
People’s Republic of China prohibitively dif-
14
ficult, costly, or both. 
15
(6) To defend itself effectively, especially in the 
16
initial period of war, it is imperative that Taiwan ac-
17
celerate deployment of cost-effective and resilient 
18
asymmetric defense capabilities, including mobile 
19
coastal and air defenses, naval mines, missile boats, 
20
man-portable anti-armor weapons, civil defense 
21
forces, and their enablers. 
22
(7) The deployment of such asymmetric defense 
23
capabilities by Taiwan would not only improve the 
24
ability of Taiwan to defend itself, but also reduce 
25
03:28 Jan 22, 2022
H6443
5 
•HR 6443 IH
operational risk to members of the United States 
1
Armed Forces under a Taiwan contingency. 
2
(8) The President of Taiwan, Tsai Ing-Wen, 
3
has— 
4
(A) vowed to bolster the national defense 
5
of Taiwan and demonstrate Taiwan’s deter-
6
mination to defend itself so as to ensure that 
7
Taiwan will not be forced to take the path that 
8
the People’s Republic of China has laid out for 
9
Taiwan; and 
10
(B) advocated the deployment of asym-
11
metric defense capabilities. 
12
(9) The Government of Taiwan has begun tak-
13
ing steps to improve Taiwan’s defenses, including by 
14
increasing Taiwan’s defense budget and through 
15
Taiwan’s new proposed special defense budget, but 
16
far more is needed, and quickly, to ensure that Tai-
17
wan is able to maintain a sufficient self-defense ca-
18
pability. 
19
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
20
gress that— 
21
(1) the threat of an invasion of Taiwan by the 
22
People’s Republic of China is increasing rapidly and 
23
expected to reach especially dangerous levels by the 
24
latter half of the 2020s; 
25
03:28 Jan 22, 2022
H6443

•HR 6443 IH
(2) the United States has a strong interest in 
1
preventing the People’s Republic of China from in-
2
vading and seizing control of Taiwan, especially by 
3
ensuring that Taiwan is able to maintain a sufficient 
4
self-defense capability; 
5
(3) the United States should establish a secu-
6
rity assistance initiative so as to accelerate, to the 
7
greatest extent possible, Taiwan’s deployment of 
8
cost-effective and resilient asymmetric defense capa-
9
bilities; 
10
(4) the United States should provide such as-
11
sistance on the condition that Taiwan— 
12
(A) matches investments by the United 
13
States in its asymmetric defense capabilities; 
14
(B) increases its defense spending to a 
15
level commensurate with the threat it faces; 
16
(C) prioritizes acquiring cost-effective and 
17
resilient asymmetric defense capabilities as rap-
18
idly as possible, including from foreign sup-
19
pliers, if necessary; and 
20
(D) demonstrates progress on defense re-
21
forms required to maximize the effectiveness of 
22
its asymmetric defenses, with special regard to 
23
Taiwan’s reserve forces; and 
24
03:28 Jan 22, 2022
H6443
7 
•HR 6443 IH
(5) in the course of executing such a security 
1
assistance initiative, the United States should— 
2
(A) seek to co-produce or co-develop cost- 
3
effective and resilient asymmetric defense capa-
4
bilities with suppliers in Taiwan, including by 
5
providing incentives to that effect, so long as 
6
those suppliers can produce such capabilities at 
7
a reasonable cost, in the quantities required, as 
8
rapidly, and to the same quality and technical 
9
standards as suppliers in the United States or 
10
other countries; and 
11
(B) encourage other countries, particularly 
12
United States allies and partners, to sell, lease, 
13
or otherwise provide appropriate asymmetric 
14
defense capabilities to Taiwan so as to facilitate 
15
Taiwan’s rapid deployment of the asymmetric 
16
defense capabilities required to deter or, if nec-
17
essary, defeat an invasion by the People’s Re-
18
public of China.

(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
5
gress that— 
6
(1) historically, the Government of Taiwan has 
7
prioritized the acquisition of conventional weapons 
8
that would be of limited utility in deterring or de-
9
feating an invasion by the People’s Republic of 
10
China at the expense of the timely acquisition of 
11
cost-effective and resilient asymmetric defense capa-
12
bilities; 
13
(2) the United States Government has often 
14
shared responsibility for the misguided prioritization 
15
of defense acquisitions described in paragraph (1) by 
16
approving sales of conventional weapons to Taiwan, 
17
despite knowledge that such sales would do little to 
18
enhance, and may even undermine, the ability of 
19
Taiwan to deter or defeat an invasion by the Peo-
20
ple’s Republic of China; 
21
(3) the misguided prioritization of defense ac-
22
quisitions described in paragraph (1) has not only 
23
undermined the ability of Taiwan to deter or defeat 
24
an invasion by the People’s Republic of China, but

has also placed at greater risk of death or injury 
1
members of the United States Armed Forces who 
2
may come under attack or be asked to come to the 
3
aid of Taiwan to repel such an invasion; and 
4
(4) any future sales, leases, or other provision 
5
of conventional weaponry to Taiwan by the United 
6
States should be conditioned on meaningful progress 
7
by the Government of Taiwan on the acquisition of

appropriate asymmetric defense capabilities.

(b) STATEMENT
OF POLICY.—For each of fiscal 
10
years 2023 through 2027, the United States Government 
11
shall not sell, lease, or otherwise provide military capabili-
12
ties to Taiwan other than asymmetric defense capabilities 
13
described in subsection (e) of section 3 until the earlier 
14
of—

(1) the date on which the Secretary of Defense

has submitted a notification under subsection (f)(4)

of that section for the fiscal year in which the Gov-

Taiwan to deter or, if necessary, defeat an inva-

detract from or undermine the ability of Taiwan

to deploy such asymmetric defense capabilities.
