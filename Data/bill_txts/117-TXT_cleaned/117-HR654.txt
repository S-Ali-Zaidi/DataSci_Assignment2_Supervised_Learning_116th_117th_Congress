RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the designation of September 17, 
2021, as ‘‘National Concussion Awareness Day’’. 
Whereas mild traumatic brain injury, otherwise known as a 
‘‘concussion’’, is an important health concern for chil-
dren, teens, and adults; 
Whereas, according to information from the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention— 
(1) there are as many as 1,600,000 to 3,800,000 
sports-related concussions annually; 
(2) as many as 5,300,000 individuals live with a dis-
ability because of a traumatic brain injury; 
(3) between 2010 and 2016, an estimated 2,000,000 
children under age 18 visited an emergency department 
because of a traumatic brain injury sustained during 
sports- or recreation-related activities;

(4) an estimated 283,000 children seek care in 
United States emergency departments each year for a 
sports- or recreation-related traumatic brain injury, with 
traumatic brain injuries sustained in contact sports ac-
counting for approximately 45 percent of these visits; and 
(5) research suggests that many children with a 
traumatic brain injury do not seek care in emergency de-
partments or do not seek care at all, resulting in a sig-
nificant underestimate of prevalence; 
Whereas the seriousness of concussions should not be mini-
mized in athletics, and return-to-play and return-to-learn 
protocols can help ensure recovery; 
Whereas concussions can affect physical, mental, and social 
health, and a greater awareness and understanding of 
proper diagnosis and management of concussions is crit-
ical to improved outcomes; and 
Whereas the House of Representatives can raise awareness 
about concussions among the medical community and the 
public: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) expresses support for the designation of 
2
‘‘National Concussion Awareness Day’’; 
3
(2) recognizes that mild traumatic brain injury 
4
(‘‘mTBI’’), otherwise known as a concussion, is an

important health concern;

(3) commends the organizations and individuals

that raise awareness about mild traumatic brain in-
