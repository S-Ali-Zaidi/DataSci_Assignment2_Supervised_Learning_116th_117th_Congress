•HR 7294 IH
(1) Female students who are enrolled at institu-
1
tions of higher education and experiencing un-
2
planned pregnancies may face pressure that their 
3
only option is to receive an abortion or risk academic 
4
failure. 
5
(2) 27.6 percent of all abortions in the United 
6
States are performed on women of college age, be-
7
tween the ages of 20 and 24, according to a 2019 
8
report by the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
9
vention. 
10
(3) A significant proportion of abortions in the 
11
United States are performed on women of college 
12
age who may be unaware of their rights under title 
13
IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (20 
14
U.S.C. 1681) or deprived of an alternative to receiv-
15
ing an abortion. 
16
(4) Additionally, women on college campuses 
17
may fear institutional reprisal, loss of athletic schol-
18
arship, and possible negative impact on academic op-
19
portunities. 
20
(5) An academic disparity exists because of the 
21
lack of resources, support, and notifications available 
22
for female college students who do not wish to re-
23
ceive an abortion or who carry their unborn babies 
24
to term.
