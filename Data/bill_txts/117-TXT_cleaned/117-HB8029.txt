Relations Act (22 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.), in ensuring 
1
that Taiwan has all resources necessary to defend 
2
itself, especially by asymmetric ways and means,

(2) the threat of military action by the People’s

7
rapidly than many anticipated, with the current and

cific Command testifying that the Government of the

11
tary balance over Taiwan as favorable to an invasion

well before 2035 and potentially as soon as 2027;

(3) it is imperative that the United States pro-
14
vide Taiwan with defensive resources with urgency, 
15
not only so that Taiwan can better defend itself 
16
against military action by the People’s Republic of 
17
China, but also to reduce the operational risk to the 
18
United States Armed Forces, if the President com-
19
mits such forces to Taiwan’s defense following the 
20
initiation of hostilities by the Government of the 
21
People’s Republic of China;

(4) the inclusion of Taiwan in Country Group
