RESOLUTION 
Acknowledging and commemorating the women in the Army 
who served in the Women’s Army Auxiliary Corps and 
the Women’s Army Corp during World War II. 
Whereas Congresswoman Edith Nourse Rogers of Massachu-
setts introduced a bill, H.R. 6293 (77th Congress), to 
create the Women’s Army Auxiliary Corps (referred to in 
this preamble as the ‘‘WAAC’’) to expand the types of 
jobs women could hold in the Army to address manpower 
shortages; 
Whereas President Franklin D. Roosevelt established the 
WAAC by signing the Act entitled ‘‘An Act to establish 
a Women’s Army Auxiliary Corps for service with the 
Army of the United States’’, approved May 14, 1942 
(commonly known as the ‘‘W.A.A.C. (Women’s Army

Auxiliary Corps) Act’’) (Public Law 77–554; 56 Stat. 
278), into law; 
Whereas while 35,000 women had served in the enlisted 
ranks of the Army primarily in nursing positions during 
World War I, women had little formal means to serve in 
non-medical roles prior to the creation of the WAAC; 
Whereas despite widely held stigmas associated with women 
in the military and numerous false allegations of impro-
priety among members of the WAAC, women applied to 
serve in such high numbers that enrollment ceilings were 
reached within the first year; 
Whereas under the leadership of Colonel Oveta Culp Hobby, 
service in the WAAC quickly exceeded the 25,000 women 
initially expected; 
Whereas Secretary of War Henry Stimson had to raise the 
limit on WAAC recruitment to 150,000 women because 
of high levels of enrollment; 
Whereas the WAAC worked across the country, from Wash-
ington to Tennessee and from New Mexico to South 
Carolina, as well as overseas; 
Whereas members of the WAAC served in numerous capac-
ities, including as switchboard operators, mechanics, 
bakers, drivers, cryptographers, lab technicians, and 
nurses; 
Whereas members of the WAAC, despite the quality and 
value of their contributions to the war effort, were not 
given benefits or pay equal to those of their male coun-
terparts, and were not recognized as full members of the 
Army; 
Whereas President Roosevelt signed the Act entitled ‘‘An Act 
to establish a Women’s Army Corps for service in the

Army of the United States’’, approved July 1, 1943 
(commonly known as the ‘‘W.A.C. (Women’s Army 
Corps) Act’’) (Public Law 78–110; 57 Stat. 371), into 
law, which converted the WAAC into the Women’s Army 
Corp (referred to in this preamble as the ‘‘WAC’’), gave 
the women official military status and the same ranks 
and privileges of their male counterparts, and allowed the 
women to serve overseas; 
Whereas during World War II, members of the WAC served 
overseas as drivers, clerks, nurses, and mechanics, ena-
bling the release of more than 7 divisions of men to serve 
in combat roles; 
Whereas towards the end of World War II, General Douglas 
MacArthur stated that the members of the WAC were 
‘‘[his] best soldiers’’, noting their dedication to hard work 
and discipline; 
Whereas General and future President Dwight D. Eisenhower 
said that the WAC’s ‘‘contributions in efficiency, skill, 
spirit, and determination are immeasurable’’; 
Whereas the WAC served as an important precursor to the 
complete gender integration of the military in 1978; and 
Whereas the brave women who served in the WAAC and the 
WAC are owed a great debt of gratitude for their service 
to the United States: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) honors the women who served the United

States in the Women’s Auxiliary Army Corp (re-

ferred to in this resolution as the ‘‘WAAC’’) and the
