RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for designation of September 2022 as 
‘‘Gospel Music Heritage Month’’ and honoring gospel 
music for its valuable and longstanding contributions 
to the culture of the United States. 
Whereas gospel music is a beloved art form unique to the 
United States, spanning decades, generations, and races; 
Whereas gospel music is one of the cornerstones of the musi-
cal tradition of the United States and has grown beyond 
its roots to achieve pop-culture and historical relevance; 
Whereas gospel music has spread beyond its geographic ori-
gins to touch audiences around the world;

can-American spirituals that blended diverse elements 
from African music and melodic influences from Irish 
folk songs and hymns, and gospel music ultimately bor-
rowed from uniquely American musical styles, including 
ragtime, jazz, and blues; 
Whereas that tradition of diversity remains today, as the in-
fluence of gospel music can be found infused in all forms 
of secular music, including rock and roll, country, soul, 
rhythm and blues, and countless other styles; 
Whereas the legacy of gospel music includes some of the most 
memorable voices and musical pioneers in the history of 
the United States, such as Thomas Dorsey, Mahalia 
Jackson, James Vaughan, Roberta Martin, Virgil 
Stamps, Diana Washington, Stamps Quartet, The High-
way QCs, The Statesmen, The Soul Stirrers, Point of 
Grace, Smokie Norful, Terry Woods, James Cleveland, 
Billy Ray Hearns, Rex Humbard, Joe Ligon and The 
Mighty Clouds of Joy, Kirk Franklin, V. Michael McKay, 
Theola Booker, Yolanda Adams, Edwin and Walter Haw-
kins, Sandi Patty, The Winans, Kathy Taylor, Mavis 
Staples and the Staple Singers, and Brenda Waters, Carl 
Preacher, Shirley Joiner of B, C & S; 
Whereas many of the biggest names in music emerged from 
the gospel music tradition or have recorded gospel music, 
including Sam Cooke, Al Green, Elvis Presley, Marvin 
Gaye, Aretha Franklin, Whitney Houston, Little Richard, 
Ray Charles, Buddy Holly, Alan Jackson, Dolly Parton, 
Mariah Carey, Bob Dylan, and Randy Travis; 
Whereas, regardless of their musical styles, those artists and 
so many more have turned to gospel music as the source 
and inspiration for their music, which has blurred the 
boundaries between secular and gospel music;

Whereas, beyond its contribution to the musical tradition of 
the United States, gospel music has provided a cultural 
and musical backdrop across all of mainstream media, 
from hit television series to major Hollywood motion pic-
tures, including ‘‘American Idol’’, ‘‘Heroes’’, ‘‘Dancing 
with the Stars’’, ‘‘O Brother, Where Art Thou?’’, ‘‘Sister 
Act’’, ‘‘The Preacher’s Wife’’, ‘‘Evan Almighty’’, and 
more; 
Whereas gospel music has a huge audience around the coun-
try and around the world, a testament to the universal 
appeal of a historical American art form that both in-
spires and entertains across racial, ethnic, religious, and 
geographic boundaries; and 
Whereas September 2022 would be an appropriate month to 
designate as ‘‘Gospel Music Heritage Month’’: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives supports 
1
the designation of ‘‘Gospel Music Heritage Month’’, which 
2
would recognize the contributions to the culture of the 
3
United States derived from the rich heritage of gospel

music and gospel music artists.
