RESOLUTION 
Supporting the designation of September 19, 2022, as ‘‘Na-
tional Stillbirth Prevention Day’’, recognizing tens of 
thousands of American families that have endured a 
stillbirth, and seizing the opportunity to keep other fami-
lies from experiencing the same tragedy. 
Whereas, 23,000 pregnancies in the United States end in 
stillbirth each year, and the COVID–19 pandemic has ex-
acerbated the crisis; 
Whereas racial disparities persist in birth outcomes, with 
Black, Hispanic, and Indigenous families at the greatest 
risk of losing a baby to stillbirth;

Whereas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, the annual number of stillbirths far exceeds 
the number of deaths among children under 15 years of 
age due to sudden infant death syndrome, car accidents, 
drowning, guns, fire, poison, and flu combined; 
Whereas, in the last 2 decades, the stillbirth rate in the 
United States declined by a negligible 0.4 percent, and in 
a report published by the World Health Organization 
comparing progress in improving stillbirth rates, the 
United States ranked 183 out of 195 countries; 
Whereas stillbirths are devastating and have a profound and 
lifelong impact on the families who endure them; 
Whereas stillbirth is linked to an increased risk of maternal 
mortality; 
Whereas, with increased awareness and better data collection, 
the United States will be able to better understand why 
stillbirths in the United States are happening at an 
alarming rate and identify what can be done to combat 
this crisis; 
Whereas proven stillbirth prevention efforts have the power to 
save a minimum of 7,500 babies every year from prevent-
able stillbirth in the United States, and innovations in 
stillbirth prevention could save thousands of additional 
families in the United States from the heartache of losing 
a baby each year; 
Whereas recognizing ‘‘National Stillbirth Prevention Day’’ is 
an opportunity to increase awareness, support evidence- 
based prevention efforts, promote research, encourage im-
proved data collection and greater understanding, and 
provide community to those who have experienced still-
birth; and

•HRES 1363 IH 
Whereas ‘‘National Stillbirth Prevention Day’’ calls on the 
President and all other Federal officials to use their au-
thorities to reduce stillbirths in the United States by at 
least 33 percent and ensure every expectant family is 
educated on how to reduce the risk of losing a baby to 
stillbirth: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the goals and ideals of ‘‘National 
2
Stillbirth Prevention Day’’; 
3
(2) understands the importance of advancing 
4
evidence-based prevention efforts; and 
5
(3) requests that the President issue a procla-
6
mation calling upon the people of the United States 
7
to observe National Stillbirth Prevention Day with 
8
appropriate awareness programs and activities.
