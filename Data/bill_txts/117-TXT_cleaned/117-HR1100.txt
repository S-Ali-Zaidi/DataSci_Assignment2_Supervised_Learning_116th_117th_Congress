Whereas National Nurses Week is a time of year to reflect 
on the important contributions that nurses make to pro-
vide safe, high-quality health care; 
Whereas nurses serve on the front lines, risking their lives 
treating the injured and sick during wartime, natural dis-
asters, and public health emergencies, including the 
COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas nurses are known to be patient advocates, acting to 
protect the lives of individuals under their care; 
Whereas nurses represent the largest single component of the 
health care profession, with an estimated population of 
more than 4,000,000 registered nurses in the United 
States; 
Whereas nurses are leading in the delivery of quality care in 
a transformed health care system that improves patient 
outcomes and safety; 
Whereas the Future of Nursing report of the Institute of 
Medicine has highlighted the need for the nursing profes-
sion to meet the call for leadership in a team-based deliv-
ery model; 
Whereas, when nurse staffing levels increase, the risk of pa-
tient complications and lengthy hospital stays decreases, 
resulting in cost savings; 
Whereas nurses are experienced researchers, and the work of 
nurses encompasses a wide scope of scientific inquiry, in-
cluding clinical research, health systems and outcomes re-
search, and nursing education research; 
Whereas nurses provide care that is sensitive to the cultures 
and customs of individuals across the United States;

tice of all nurses; and

the nurses care; 
Whereas there is a need— 
(1) to strengthen nursing workforce development 
programs at all levels, including the number of doctorally

entists who can develop new nursing care models to im-
prove the health status of the diverse population of the 
United States; 
Whereas nurses touch the lives of the people of the United 
States through every stage of life; and
