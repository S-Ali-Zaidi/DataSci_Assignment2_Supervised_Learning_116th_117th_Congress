creasing revenues, the number of employees, and the 
1
likelihood that the business venture will be success-
2
ful for participants. 
3
(2) According to the Kauffman Foundation— 
4
(A) minority-owned and women-owned 
5
businesses are half as likely to employ people 
6
than nonminority-owned and men-owned busi-
7
nesses; and 
8
(B) if minorities started businesses at the 
9
same rate as nonminorities, approximately 
10
9,500,000 jobs would be added to the economy 
11
of the United States. 
12
(3) The Kauffman Foundation also found that 
13
the percentage of startups in rural communities has 
14
dropped from 20 percent in the 1980s to 12.2 per-
15
cent. 
16
(4) According to the Martin Prosperity Insti-
17
tute, less than 1 percent of all venture capital fund-
18
ing goes to businesses located in rural areas. 
19
(5) According to PitchBook, around 2 percent 
20
of all venture capital funding goes to businesses with 
21
women founders. 
22
(6) According to Crunchbase, less than 3 per-
23
cent of all venture capital funding goes to businesses 
24
with Black and Hispanic founders.

SEC. 3. PURPOSES.

The purposes of the Innovation Centers Program es-
7

8
added by this Act, are to— 
9
(1) spur economic growth in underserved com-
10
munities by creating good paying jobs and pathways 
11
to prosperity; 
12
(2) increase prospects for success for small 
13
business concerns in underserved communities, 
14
which often suffer from higher business failure rates 
15
than the national average; 
16
(3) help create a pipeline for small business 
17
concerns in underserved and rural markets into 
18
high-growth sectors, where they are generally under-
19
represented; 
20
(4) help address the multi-decade decline in the 
21
rate of new business creation; 
22
(5) close the gaps that underserved small busi-
23
ness concerns often have in terms of revenue and
