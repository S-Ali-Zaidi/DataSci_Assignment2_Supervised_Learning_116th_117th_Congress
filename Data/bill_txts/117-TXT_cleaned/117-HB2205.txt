A BILL 
To amend title 49, United States Code, to provide grants 
and develop value capture policy. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Incentivizing Value 
4
Capture for Greener Transportation Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) In 2018, greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) 
8
rose sharply by 3.4 percent, the second-largest an-
9
nual gain in more than 20 years, and GHG emis-

sions have grown by approximately 1.5 percent every 
1
year over the last decade. 
2
(2) Greenhouse gas emissions from the trans-
3
portation sector, including cars and trucks, are the 
4
largest source of GHG emissions in the United 
5
States with the transportation sector emitting 
6
1,900,000,000 tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) annu-
7
ally. 
8
(3) Annual vehicle miles traveled (VMT) in the 
9
United States have nearly tripled since 1971, rising 
10
to 3,210,000,000,000 in 2018. 
11
(4) Consequently, in 2018, Americans lost an 
12
average of 97 hours a year due to congestion, cost-
13
ing them nearly $87,000,000,000. 
14
(5) Residents in communities located near high- 
15
capacity transit are twice as likely not to own a car 
16
as residents who live elsewhere, and they own half 
17
as many cars per household. 
18
(6) Increasing transit ridership and improving 
19
our transit systems in urban, suburban, and exurban 
20
areas, using innovative solutions such as land value 
21
capture, will help reduce VMT, congestion, GHG 
22
emissions, and reliance on fossil fuels and vehicles. 
23
By reducing such factors, the United States can help 
24
curb the effects of climate change.

‘‘(i) IN GENERAL AND POSSIBLE RE-
