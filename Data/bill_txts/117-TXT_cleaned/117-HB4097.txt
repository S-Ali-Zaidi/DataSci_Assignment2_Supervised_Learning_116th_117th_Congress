To support educational entities in fully implementing title 
IX and reducing and preventing sex discrimination in 
all areas of education, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Patsy T. Mink and

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 4097 IH
(1) Title IX of the Education Amendments of 
1
1972 (20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.) (in this Act referred 
2
to as ‘‘title IX’’) and the implementing regulations 
3
of title IX prohibit sex discrimination in federally 
4
funded education programs and activities. 
5
(2) Although title IX requires that schools treat 
6
students equally with regard to athletic participation 
7
opportunities, athletic scholarships, and the benefits 
8
and services provided to athletic teams, female par-
9
ticipation rates, especially for girls of color, lag far 
10
behind male participation rates. Nationally, for ex-
11
ample, boys receive more than 1,130,000 more op-
12
portunities to play high school sports than girls. 
13
(3) Furthermore, a recent study from the Wom-
14
en’s Sports Foundation found that African-American 
15
youth and youth from low-income households were 
16
least likely to be current players (35 percent and 28 
17
percent respectively) and most likely to have never 
18
played sports (49 percent, and 54 percent respec-
19
tively) compared to others. These disparities were 
20
especially prominent for girls from low-income fami-
21
lies (25 percent current players, 58 percent never 
22
played) and African-American families (28 percent 
23
current players, 55 percent never played). The gaps 
24
in participation in high school sports have not sig-
25
01:46 Jul 10, 2021

•HR 4097 IH
nificantly narrowed in the past 20 years—with 40 
1
percent of predominantly minority-serving high 
2
schools having large gaps between the percentage of 
3
spots on teams for girls and the percentage of stu-
4
dents who are girls (compared to only 16 percent of 
5
predominantly White high schools that have such 
6
gaps). 
7
(4) Female student athletes have been found to 
8
have higher levels of self-esteem, as well as reduced 
9
risk 
for 
cardiovascular 
disease, 
diabetes, 
10
osteoporosis, and breast cancer, compared to those 
11
who do not play sports. In addition, female student 
12
athletes are more likely to graduate from high school 
13
than female students who do not play sports. Girls 
14
who play sports in high school go on to earn 7 per-
15
cent higher annual wages than those who do not 
16
play sports, and are more likely to enter the labor 
17
force and pursue higher-skill, previously male-domi-
18
nated positions. Generally, sports participation for 
19
women is associated with a lower prevalence of expe-
20
riencing intimate partner violence, reinforcing that 
21
athletic access not only strengthens health, edu-
22
cational, and workplace outcomes, but also personal 
23
safety.

•HR 4097 IH
(5) Although the availability of athletic scholar-
1
ships facilitates access to higher education, many in-
2
stitutions of higher education fail to award propor-
3
tional athletic financial aid to women, which can af-
4
fect their long-term employment outcomes and eco-
5
nomic security. According to the Department of 
6
Education’s Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act data 
7
from 2019, male athletes at NCAA Division I and 
8
II schools received $240,000,000 more in athletic 
9
scholarships than female athletes at those schools. 
10
(6) Although title IX ensures gender equity in 
11
career and technical education, women are severely 
12
underrepresented in fields nontraditional to their 
13
gender. A recent study by the National Coalition for 
14
Women and Girls in Education indicated that 
15
women make up more than 80 percent of workers 
16
with training or certification in historically women- 
17
dominated occupations that pay less than $30,000 
18
per year, including child care, early childhood edu-
19
cation, home care, and cosmetology. Women rep-
20
resent less than 40 percent of workers trained or 
21
certified in high-paying and historically male-domi-
22
nated fields, including transportation, advanced 
23
manufacturing, and construction.

•HR 4097 IH
(7) Although title IX ensures gender equity in 
1
the fields of science, technology, engineering, and 
2
mathematics 
(in 
this 
section 
referred 
to 
as 
3
‘‘STEM’’) education, women are disproportionately 
4
lost at nearly every stage of the STEM pipeline. A 
5
recent report by the National Center for Education 
6
Statistics showed that women earned only 32 per-
7
cent of all STEM degrees in 2017, and nearly 1⁄2 of 
8
these women were White. Women of color earned 
9
about 12 percent of STEM degrees in that same 
10
year. Furthermore, in STEM fields where women 
11
are particularly underrepresented, such as com-
12
puting and engineering, women earned an even 
13
smaller percentage of degrees, including only 19 per-
14
cent of computing bachelor’s degrees, and 21 per-
15
cent of engineering bachelor’s degrees. 
16
(8) Although title IX prohibits sex discrimina-
17
tion in employment in federally funded education 
18
programs, a recent report by the American Associa-
19
tion of University Women found that women com-
20
prise only 36 percent of tenured faculty and 30 per-
21
cent of university presidents. A similar study by the 
22
National Science Foundation confirmed that women 
23
only hold 34 percent of all tenured and tenure-track 
24
positions, and 27 percent of full professor positions 
25
01:46 Jul 10, 2021

in STEM fields. Furthermore, Black and Latina 
1
women, together, hold only 4 percent of all tenured 
2
and tenure-track positions, and barely over 2 percent 
3
of full professor positions in STEM fields. Asian- 
4
American women hold around 5 percent of all 
5
tenured and tenure-track positions, and less than 3 
6
percent of full professor positions in STEM fields. 
7
(9) Although title IX protects against sexual 
8
and sex-based harassment and violence, more than 
9
50 percent of girls and 40 percent of boys in grades 
10
7 through 12 experience sexual harassment each 
11
year, and approximately 10 percent of high school 
12
students experience dating violence each year. A re-
13
cent GLSEN report indicated that 87 percent of les-
14
bian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and ques-
15
tioning (referred to in this section as ‘‘LGBTQ’’) 
16
students have experienced harassment or assault 
17
based on a personal characteristic, and nearly 66 
18
percent have experienced LGBTQ-related verbal har-
19
assment at school based on sexual orientation. Re-
20
search has shown that LGBTQ students who experi-
21
ence harassment at school are more likely to experi-
22
ence depression and anxiety, to engage in unhealthy 
23
and antisocial behaviors, and to have more unex-
24
cused absences from school.

•HR 4097 IH
(10) Although title IX prohibits discrimination 
1
on the basis of pregnancy or parenting status, the 
2
limited availability of accommodations, including lac-
3
tation accommodations, excused absences for preg-
4
nancy-related medical conditions, and child care 
5
needs (including caring for a sick child) is a leading 
6
reason that parenting mothers drop out of high 
7
school. A recent report by the National Women’s 
8
Law Center indicated that only half of teenage 
9
mothers earn a high school diploma by the age of 
10
22, compared with 89 percent of women who do not 
11
have a child during their teenage years, and that 
12
one-third of young mothers will never get a diploma 
13
or GED, further limiting continuing opportunities 
14
for education and employment. 
15
(11) Although title IX protects against dis-
16
crimination based on stereotypes of actual or per-
17
ceived sex, many people carry implicit or uncon-
18
scious biases that can unintentionally influence atti-
19
tudes, beliefs, behaviors, and decisionmaking proc-
20
esses. Research has shown that unconscious biases 
21
can impact classroom environments, teaching meth-
22
ods, student evaluations, disciplinary practices, and 
23
career and counseling guidance, which can lead to 
24
discrimination against students based on race, color,

national origin, and disability, particularly for stu-
1
dents who are pursuing nontraditional fields. 
2
(12) Nationally, the Feminist Majority Founda-
3
tion has estimated there at least 100,000 title IX co-
4
ordinators are needed, but a recent report only iden-
5
tified 23,000 title IX coordinators in 2016. The 
6
Feminist Majority Foundation has found that 
7
schools serving children in prekindergarten through 
8
grade 12 rarely have their own title IX coordinators.
