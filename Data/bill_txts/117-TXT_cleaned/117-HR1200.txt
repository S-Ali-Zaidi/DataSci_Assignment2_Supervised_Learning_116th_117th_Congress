RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the significance of the 40th anniversary of 
Vincent Chin’s death. 
Whereas June 23, 2022, marks the 40th anniversary of the 
death of Vincent Jen Chin; 
Whereas Chin, a United States citizen of Chinese descent, 
lived in Michigan during an economic recession when fac-
tories were being closed and workers were being laid off, 
leading some to blame Japanese imports for the chal-
lenges facing the United States automobile industry; 
Whereas the economic challenges in Detroit resulted in strong 
anti-Japanese sentiments, including acts of vandalism 
against Japanese cars, threats against Japanese car own-

ers, disparaging signs, and attempts to burn the Japa-
nese flag in protest; 
Whereas Chin, who was celebrating his upcoming wedding 
with friends in the Detroit area, was chased down and 
beaten to death with a baseball bat by two men who ac-
cused him of being responsible for the loss of automobile 
manufacturing jobs in the United States; 
Whereas Chin’s killers were found guilty of manslaughter and 
sentenced to 3 years of probation and a $3,000 fine, 
never serving a day in jail for Chin’s murder; 
Whereas the tragedy of Chin’s death became a primary cata-
lyst for a unified, panethnic Asian American and Pacific 
Islander (AAPI) movement and united people from all 
communities to fight against hate; 
Whereas the lessons of Chin’s death still hold critical rel-
evance today as we address the ongoing challenges of 
hate crimes, profiling, xenophobia, and bullying; 
Whereas anti-Asian hate has occurred throughout our na-
tion’s history and continues in the present day; 
Whereas it was anti-Asian hate that fueled the Chinese 
American Exclusion Act of 1882, the imprisonment of 
120,000 innocent Japanese Americans during World War 
II, and attacks targeting Muslim, Middle Eastern, Arab, 
Sikh, and South Asian communities after 9/11; 
Whereas, in 2021, anti-Asian hate crimes increased by 339 
percent, and in 2020, they increased by 124 percent; 
Whereas over 11,000 anti-Asian hate incidents have been re-
ported to Stop AAPI Hate since March 2020, and many 
more have gone unreported;

Whereas far too many have lost their lives to the most recent 
wave of anti-Asian hate; 
Whereas a recent survey found that between 2021 and 2022, 
Americans have become more likely to suspect that Asian 
Americans are more loyal to the countries they or their 
families immigrated from than the United States; 
Whereas the most recent wave of anti-Asian hate stems not 
only from the pandemic but also from broader rhetoric 
around economic competition with China, mirroring the 
hate that fueled the brutal attack that killed Vincent 
Chin; and 
Whereas history is once again repeating itself as anti-Asian 
hate rises in a time of economic anxiety: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) recognizes the significance of the 40th anni-
2
versary of Vincent Chin’s death as an important 
3
time to reflect on the dangers of xenophobia and 
4
scapegoating of Asian and Asian-American commu-
5
nities; 
6
(2) recognizes that anti-Asian hate continues to 
7
plague our country; and 
8
(3) mourns all those who have lost their lives to 
9
anti-Asian hate.
