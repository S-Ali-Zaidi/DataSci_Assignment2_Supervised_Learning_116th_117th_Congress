To reauthorize and improve a grant program to assist insti-
tutions of higher education in establishing, maintaining, 
improving, and operating Student Veteran Centers. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Veteran Education 
4
Empowerment Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Over 1,000,000 veterans attend institutions 
8
of higher education each year.

(2) Veterans face unique challenges in transi-
1
tioning from the battlefield to the classroom and 
2
eventually to the workforce, including: age dif-
3
ferences, family obligations, significant time away 
4
from academic life, and service-related disabilities. 
5
(3) The National Education Association found 
6
that student veterans can feel lonely and vulnerable 
7
on campus and that ‘‘connecting student veterans 
8
can effectively ease this isolation’’ by bringing to-
9
gether new student veterans with those who have al-
10
ready successfully navigated the first few semesters 
11
of college. 
12
(4) According to Mission United—a United 
13
Way program that helps veterans re-acclimate to ci-
14
vilian life—it is often ‘‘essential’’ for student vet-
15
erans to be mentored by ‘‘another veteran who un-
16
derstands their mindset and experience’’. 
17
(5) Student Veteran Centers are recognized as 
18
an institutional best practice by Student Veterans of 
19
America. 
20
(6) The American Council on Education, which 
21
represents more than 1,700 institutions of higher 
22
education across the United States, has called hav-
23
ing a dedicated space for veterans on campus ‘‘a 
24
promising way for colleges and universities to better 
25

•HR 3586 IH
serve veterans on campus’’ and a ‘‘critical’’ compo-
1
nent of many colleges’ efforts to serve their student 
2
veterans. 
3
(7) The Department of Education included as 
4
one of its 8 Keys to Veterans’ Success that colleges 
5
and universities should ‘‘coordinate and centralize 
6
campus efforts for all veterans, together with the 
7
creation of a designated space for them’’. 
8
(8) Budget constraints often make it difficult or 
9
impossible for institutions of higher education to 
10
dedicate space to veteran offices, lounges, or student 
11
centers. 
12
(9) The 110th Congress authorized the funding 
13
of Student Veteran Centers through the Centers of 
14
Excellence for Veteran Student Success under part 
15
T of title VIII of the Higher Education Act of 1965 
16
(20 U.S.C. 1161t). Congress also chose to appro-
17
priate funding for this program for fiscal year 2015 
18
under the Consolidated and Further Continuing Ap-
19
propriations Act, 2015 (Public Law 113–235). 
20
(10) According to the Department of Edu-
21
cation, federally funded Student Veteran Centers 
22
and staff have generated improved recruitment, re-
23
tention, and graduation rates, have helped student 
24
veterans feel better connected across campus, and
