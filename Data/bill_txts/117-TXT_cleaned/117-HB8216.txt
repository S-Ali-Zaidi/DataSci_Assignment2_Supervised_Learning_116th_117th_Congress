A BILL 
To promote digital citizenship and media literacy. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Digital Citizenship and 
4
Media Literacy Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) People in the United States rely on infor-
8
mation from mass media, social media, and digital 
9
media to make decisions about all aspects of social, 
10

economic, and political life, including products and 
1
services consumption, employment, career and pro-
2
fessional development, family and leisure choices, 
3
health and wellness, and democratic engagement. 
4
Ensuring that people in the United States possess 
5
the skills to make these informed decisions based on 
6
media begins early in life. 
7
(2) Adversaries from Russia, China, and Iran 
8
are using information warfare to influence democ-
9
racies across the world, and terrorist organizations 
10
often use digital communications to recruit mem-
11
bers. The United States can fight these influences 
12
by ensuring that citizens of the United States pos-
13
sess the necessary skills to discern disinformation 
14
and misinformation and think critically about their 
15
digital activities. 
16
(3) Media literacy education has proven critical 
17
to allies of the United States in building national re-
18
silience to foreign disinformation campaigns. Coun-
19
tries like Estonia, Finland, and Ukraine have devel-
20
oped and implemented successful media literacy edu-
21
cation programs in schools that have helped counter 
22
Russian disinformation campaigns. The United 
23
States has also invested in and promoted media lit-
24
eracy education abroad, including in the Baltics.

•HR 8216 IH
(4) Following Russia’s increased aggression to-
1
wards Ukraine and the West this year, and Russia’s 
2
invasion of Ukraine, media literacy skills have been 
3
important in ensuring Ukrainians and citizens of 
4
Western allied countries are not influenced by Rus-
5
sian disinformation. 
6
(5) In order to build similar national resilience 
7
against foreign disinformation in the United States, 
8
Congress has recommended investing in media lit-
9
eracy education. 
10
(6) The bipartisan and bicameral Cyberspace 
11
Solarium Commission’s 2020 report recommended 
12
that the United States invest in media literacy, writ-
13
ing that ‘‘[b]y promoting modern civics education 
14
and digital literacy programs, the U.S. government 
15
can assist in enhancing the average American’s abil-
16
ity to discern the trustworthiness of online content, 
17
and thereby reduce the impact of malicious foreign 
18
cyber-enabled information campaigns’’, and con-
19
cluded that Congress should authorize a grant pro-
20
gram ‘‘to improve digital citizenship and to incor-
21
porate effective digital literacy curricula in American 
22
classrooms at the K-12 level and beyond’’. 
23
(7) Similarly, the Select Committee on Intel-
24
ligence of the Senate stated, in a bipartisan report 
25
22:43 Jul 07, 2022
H8216
4 
•HR 8216 IH
released during the 116th Congress, ‘‘Addressing the 
1
challenge of disinformation in the long-term will ulti-
2
mately need to be tackled by an informed and dis-
3
cerning population of citizens who are both alert to 
4
the threat and armed with the critical thinking skills 
5
necessary to protect against malicious influence.’’ 
6
The Committee then recommended that a ‘‘public 
7
initiative—propelled by Federal funding but led in 
8
large part by state and local education institutions— 
9
focused on building media literacy from an early age 
10
would help build long-term resilience to foreign ma-
11
nipulation of our democracy’’. 
12
(8) Media literacy and digital citizenship edu-
13
cation also empowers young people and is critical to 
14
improving the health and wellness of young people, 
15
preventing cyberbullying, and enabling young people 
16
to make informed decisions about products and serv-
17
ices, including advertisements and controlled sub-
18
stances. 
19
(9) Social media and other online activities have 
20
been shown to have serious negative impacts on the 
21
mental and physical health of young people. Many 
22
studies have found that media literacy education is 
23
one of the most successful strategies for countering 
24
body image issues and eating disorders in children. 
25
22:43 Jul 07, 2022
H8216
5 
•HR 8216 IH
The National Eating Disorders Association, in part-
1
nership with California State University, Northridge, 
2
published a Digital Media Literacy toolkit to help 
3
students, including high school students, learn skills 
4
to think critically about body images and the online 
5
content they see. 
6
(10) Education and childhood development ex-
7
perts, as well as academic and medical researchers, 
8
have recommended that a key method for preventing 
9
and countering the negative impacts described in 
10
paragraph (9) is to teach media literacy skills to 
11
young people beginning early in their education. 
12
(11) A successful and inclusive media literacy 
13
program must be directed at students beginning in 
14
kindergarten and should continue throughout the 
15
completion of postsecondary education. Media lit-
16
eracy education must be inclusive and accessible for 
17
all students, including multilingual students, stu-
18
dents with limited proficiency in English, and stu-
19
dents with disabilities. Learning to critically analyze 
20
and create media is a lifelong process that can be 
21
developed by integrating media literacy competencies 
22
into academic curriculum across content areas and 
23
disciplines.
