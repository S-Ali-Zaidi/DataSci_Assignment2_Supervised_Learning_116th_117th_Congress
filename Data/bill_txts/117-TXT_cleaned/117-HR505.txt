RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the people of Afghanistan, con-
demning the Taliban’s assault on human rights, and 
calling for the Federal Government to protect the Afghan 
citizens who bravely served alongside the Armed Forces 
of the United States by providing adequate resources 
for the special immigrant visa program established under 
the Afghan Allies Protection Act of 2009.

•HRES 505 IH 
Whereas the House of Representatives must maintain the in-
tegrity of the United States by reaffirming the commit-
ment of our Nation to the brave Afghan citizens who 
stood by the side of the Armed Forces of the United 
States in Afghanistan at great personal risk; 
Whereas the mission of the United States in Afghanistan has 
been supported by thousands of brave Afghan citizens 
who have worked as interpreters, translators, and con-
tractors, among other important roles, and have risked 
their lives, and those of their families, to facilitate the se-
curity operations of the United States and our partners; 
Whereas the Taliban and Islamic State both view these Af-
ghan citizens as traitors, whose involvement with United 
States forces should be punished by death, and have fol-
lowed through on their threats with executions of locals 
who helped, and protected the lives of, United States per-
sonnel deployed to Afghanistan; 
Whereas, since 2018, over 300 Afghan interpreters have been 
murdered by the Taliban for their support of the Armed 
Forces of the United States; 
Whereas the willingness of these individuals to accept dif-
ficult and dangerous work was informed by the prospect 
of qualifying for lawful permanent residence in the 
United States under the Afghan Allies Protection Act of 
2009 (8 U.S.C. 1101 note) should they or their family 
members experience a serious threat as a consequence of 
their employment; 
Whereas the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (Public 
Law 116–260) authorized 4,000 additional special immi-
grant visas for Afghan principal aliens, for a total of 
26,500 visas allocated since December 19, 2014;

•HRES 505 IH 
Whereas the authority to issue special immigrant visas to Af-
ghan nationals under section 602(b) of the Afghan Allies 
Protection Act of 2009 (8 U.S.C. 1101 note) will con-
tinue until all visa numbers allocated under that Act are 
issued; 
Whereas, despite an authorized cap of 26,500 special immi-
grant visas, only about 16,000 visas have been issued 
since the program began; 
Whereas just 237 visa applications were granted in the last 
3 months of 2020, plus 1,084 more for family members; 
Whereas the current special immigrant visa program does not 
allow for family members of a primary applicant to con-
tinue with the process if the primary applicant dies be-
fore filing a petition with U.S. Citizenship and Immigra-
tion Services; 
Whereas there are roughly 18,000 total applications pending, 
with about 15,000 of those still at the early stages of the 
process—including roughly 5,000 of those waiting for ini-
tial action by the United States mission in Afghanistan 
and Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs—to de-
termine whether the applications can proceed; 
Whereas approximately 19,000 courageous individuals, and 
an unknown number of their family members, are still 
awaiting their special immigrant visa as the United 
States continues its path for withdrawal; 
Whereas it could take upward of 2 years for the Department 
of State to complete its processing of the current pool, 
assuming that applicant numbers and processing rates 
remain static, although numbers are expected to rise as 
the United States military withdraws by September 2021;

•HRES 505 IH 
Whereas Congress has authorized only 4,000 special immi-
grant visas for Afghan principal aliens for 2021 and, 
given the delays associated with utilizing previous years’ 
visa authorizations, it is unlikely to clear the backlog of 
applicants by the September 2021 withdrawal deadline; 
Whereas, on April 14, 2021, President Biden announced that 
the United States would begin withdrawing its military 
forces from Afghanistan on May 1, 2021, with the goal 
of completing the military withdrawal by September 
2021, heralding a possible end to the nearly 2-decade 
United States military presence; 
Whereas, even if all available visas are used, many of special 
immigrant visa applicants and their families—and more 
who are likely to apply in the coming months—will re-
main in Afghanistan following the United States military 
withdrawal; 
Whereas, without significant action by the administration to 
clear the visa backlog, our former partners and their 
families could potentially be persecuted once the United 
States military withdraws from Afghanistan; 
Whereas, if the United States fails to adequately protect its 
partners when it withdraws from the Afghanistan con-
flict, future partners could be less willing to cooperate 
with the United States military, undermining national se-
curity interests; 
Whereas bipartisan Members of the House of Representatives 
and the Senate have pressed the Biden Administration to 
expedite processing for the special immigrant visa pro-
gram and pledged to start a working group to coordinate 
White House engagement;

•HRES 505 IH 
Whereas bipartisan Members of the House of Representatives 
and the Senate have urged the Biden Administration to 
plan for, and, if required, organize, an emergency evacu-
ation of Afghan partners before the United States mili-
tary drawdown, if the visa backlog could not be resolved 
in time; and 
Whereas the United States and its allies and partners must 
stand together with our Afghan partners and provide safe 
haven from Taliban retribution: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) recognizes the sacrifices and bravery of the 
2
Afghan people in their struggle for democracy, rule 
3
of law, and respect for human rights while enduring 
4
decades-long conflict and oppression by the Taliban; 
5
(2) condemns the continued human rights viola-
6
tions committed by the Taliban against women, civil 
7
society activists, opposition leaders, students, edu-
8
cators, medical personnel, and journalists, among 
9
others, and calls for the group to halt any further 
10
acts of violence against its own citizens; 
11
(3) recognizes the danger that many formerly 
12
United States-employed Afghan partners and their 
13
families face should the Taliban regain control of Af-
14
ghanistan; 
15
(4) understands that the United States has a 
16
moral obligation and a national security interest in

(5) calls for Congress to increase by 8,000 the 
3
visa allocation for the special immigrant visa pro-
4
gram established under the Afghan Allies Protection 
5
Act of 2009 (8 U.S.C. 1101 note) and allocate fund-
6
ing that cover the costs of each special immigrant

visa under such Act;

(6) urges the Secretary of State, in coordina-
9
tion with other relevant agencies as needed, to expe-
10
dite processing of the thousands of applications sub-
11
mitted under such Act that are awaiting further 
12
processing by the Bureau of Consular Affairs fol-
13
lowing the results of interagency security vetting; 
14
(7) calls on the Secretary of State to press the 
15
Department of Defense to improve its contributions 
16
to the special immigrant visa process under such Act 
17
and dedicate increased resources to special immi-
18
grant visa employment verification, another signifi-
19
cant contributor to delays in processing under such 
20
Act; 
21
(8) calls on the Secretary of State to utilize 
22
other applicable visa categories and sufficiently sup-
23
port refugee screening that will be vital to help Af-

2
(9) calls on the Secretary of State to modify the

special immigrant visa system to allow family mem-
4
bers of a primary applicant to continue the applica-
5
tion process even if the primary applicant dies before

filing a petition with U.S. Citizenship and Immigra-

conduct prudent planning for the possible evacuation

of Afghan partners and their families if the security

situation in Afghanistan continues to deteriorate and

the Taliban assume control of the Government;

(11) urges the United States Government to

work with our allies and partners in taking all avail-
16
able measures to prevent a resurgence of increased

violence against defenders of human rights in Af-

rights of women and girls, hold political office, are

involved in the peace processes, or are otherwise in
