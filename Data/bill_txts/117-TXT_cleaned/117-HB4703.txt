A BILL 
To require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint coins 
to honor and memorialize the tragedy of the Sultana 
Steamboat explosion of 1865, which is the greatest mari-
time disaster in United States history. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Sultana Steamboat 
4
Disaster Commemorative Coin Act of 2021’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
The Congress finds the following:

•HR 4703 IH
(1) On April 27, 1865, the Sultana, a Mis-
1
sissippi River paddlewheel steamboat, exploded kill-
2
ing nearly 1,200 of the 2,137 passengers and crew 
3
on board. Based on the number of recorded casual-
4
ties, this event is the worst maritime disaster in 
5
United States history. 
6
(2) The Sultana was launched on January 3, 
7
1863, and was built for speed and capacity. Its four 
8
tubular, fire-tube boilers could generate twice as 
9
much steam per fuel load as conventional fuel boilers 
10
at that time. However, these advantages came with 
11
shortcomings in safety. In a tubular boiler system, 
12
the water levels had to always be maintained. Any 
13
slight dip in the water would cause sediment build 
14
up around the boilers or lead to hot spots on the 
15
boilers leading to metal fatigue. Both occurrences 
16
greatly increased the risk of explosion. Additionally, 
17
the Sultana was built with highly flammable light-
18
weight wood that was covered with paint and var-
19
nish. The likelihood of any such explosion would be 
20
devastating. 
21
(3) Those aboard the boat were mostly paroled 
22
Union soldiers having been taken prisoners of war 
23
and sent to the notoriously overcrowded Confederate 
24
prisons of Cahaba in Alabama and Andersonville in 
25

Georgia. These men largely hailed from the States 
1
of Ohio, Tennessee, Indiana, Michigan, Kentucky, 
2
and West Virginia. The POWs that survived these 
3
prisons at the end of the Civil War in April 1865 
4
were marched to Vicksburg, Mississippi, for their re-
5
turn north. 
6
(4) The Union army was paying the Sultana’s 
7
captain $5 for each enlisted man and $10 for each 
8
officer taken aboard. The Sultana originally was 
9
only built for a capacity of 376 people, and now 
10
found itself crowded with 2,137 people. 
11
(5) Bound for Cairo, Illinois, and forcing itself 
12
against the strong Mississippi River current, the 
13
Sultana was ten miles upriver from Memphis, Ten-
14
nessee, at 2 a.m., when the strained boilers ex-
15
ploded. Many were killed instantly by the explosion; 
16
many others were killed by fire, falling timbers, 
17
shrapnel, searing steam from the boilers, and drown-
18
ing. 
19
(6) The remains of the Sultana took about 
20
twenty minutes to burn to the waterline and resting 
21
in the mud on the Arkansas-side of the Mississippi 
22
River. It is believed to be buried today under twenty 
23
feet of soil beneath a soybean field near Marion, Ar-
24
kansas, in Crittenden County.

(7) Many of the dead were buried in Memphis 
1
cemeteries. Bodies of the deceased that could be 
2
identified were taken home where cemetery markers 
3
pay tribute. 
4
(8) The Sultana disaster was overshadowed in 
5
the press by other major events surrounding the end 
6
of the American Civil War, including the assassina-
7
tion of President Abraham Lincoln on April 15, 
8
1865, and subsequently, the killing of President Lin-
9
coln’s assassin, John Wilkes Booth, on April 26, 
10
1865, just one day before the Sultana disaster. 
11
(9) A small group in Marion, Arkansas, formed 
12
the Sultana Historical Preservation Society and 
13
opened a modest museum in 2015. The Society, a 
14
501(c)(3) organization, is now planning a new Sul-
15
tana Disaster Museum to be located in the center of 
16
the City of Marion, at the site of the original Marion 
17
Public School gymnasium, a Works Progress Admin-
18
istration era building opened in 1939. 
19
(A) On April 27, 2021, the 156th anniver-
20
sary of the steamboat explosion, the Society an-
21
nounced an initial $7.5 million capital campaign 
22
to fund the new museum. The goal has since in-
23
creased to $14 million to accommodate up-
24
graded exhibit designs.

(B) The future museum will commemorate 
1
and honor those who experienced the horrific 
2
disaster and preserve a piece of United States 
3
history. 
4
(C) The museum is projected to attract 
5
50,000 visitors to Marion, Arkansas, annually, 
6
with tourists projected to contribute over $3.5 
7
million in spending in the surrounding cities. 
8
(10) The commemorative coins will contribute 
9
to additional funding for the future Sultana disaster 
10
museum, while recognizing and remembering this 
11
historical tragedy and those who perished in the ex-
12
plosion.
