TITLE III—PROTECTING WORK-

ERS FOR A CLEAN FUTURE 
12
ACT 
13
SEC. 9. FINDINGS. 
14
Congress finds the following: 
15
(1) The fossil fuel and fossil fuel-dependent in-
16
dustries have been major drivers of employment and 
17
economic growth in regions throughout California. 
18
Yet, despite the success of these industries, many 
19
local residents are unemployed or live in poverty. In 
20
addition, nearby communities often suffer from pol-
21
lution, poor air and water quality, and other health 
22
hazards. The goal of community transition grants is 
23
to develop a vision for a future economy based on 
24
equity, sustainability, and shared prosperity. A re-
25
16:39 Nov 15, 2021
H5896
25 
•HR 5896 IH
gional approach requires bringing together a diverse 
1
set of stakeholders that represent the whole commu-
2
nity. This coalition must be capable of developing 
3
and implementing strategies to support workers and 
4
communities that will be affected by the transition 
5
away from fossil fuels. To be effective, coalitions 
6
should work closely with high road employers and in-
7
dustry leaders to identify in-demand skills and work-
8
force strategies that promote emerging and expand-
9
ing sectors of the regional economy. 
10
(2) These strategies should provide pathways 
11
for impacted workers to transition to other sustain-
12
able jobs and careers. They should also include the 
13
frontline communities who have historically been ex-
14
cluded from the economic benefits of the fossil fuel 
15
industry, while bearing the greatest costs of pollu-
16
tion and ecological damage. 
17
(3) Partnerships should include organizations 
18
representing workers and communities impacted by 
19
the fossil fuel industry and the transition to a car-
20
bon-constrained economy. Workers, residents, and 
21
community leaders have inherent knowledge of re-
22
gional dynamics, issues, and needs, and should func-
23
tion at the center of developing regional solutions. 
24
16:39 Nov 15, 2021
H5896
26 
•HR 5896 IH
(4) In addition, coalitions should be diverse and 
1
represent a wide range of regional interests and 
2
stakeholders, including organizations representing 
3
labor, environmental justice, industry, economic de-
4
velopment, local tribal and municipal government, 
5
and educational institutions. 
6
(5) As the United States and global economies 
7
shift from fossil fuels to more sustainable sources of 
8
energy, the fossil fuel workforce cannot be left be-
9
hind. They must be part of the conversation and 
10
have a role in shaping the transition.
