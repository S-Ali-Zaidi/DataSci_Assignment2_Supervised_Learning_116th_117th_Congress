To establish limitations on modifications to trade agreements, 
and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Protecting American 
4
Innovation Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

H7430

•HR 7430 IH
(1) Section 8 of article I of the United States 
1
Constitution provides Congress with authority over 
2
international trade. Congress has used that author-
3
ity to approve a number of trade agreements, includ-
4
ing the WTO Agreement. 
5
(2) Section 8 of article I of the United States 
6
Constitution provides Congress with authority to 
7
provide intellectual property protections in order to 
8
‘‘promote the progress of science and useful arts’’. 
9
People in the United States rely on those protections 
10
to support jobs and continue the highly successful 
11
leadership of the United States with respect to inno-
12
vation. 
13
(3) The United States may not withdraw or 
14
otherwise alter the rights and obligations for the 
15
United States arising from a congressionally ap-
16
proved trade agreement without the consent of Con-
17
gress. 
18
(4) The United States is a global leader in con-
19
taining and ending the COVID–19 pandemic. 
20
(5) Innovators in the United States successfully 
21
and rapidly brought to fruition vaccines that provide 
22
highly effective protection against COVID–19. At fa-
23
cilities across the United States, thousands of 
24
United States workers are working around the clock

to manufacture COVID–19 vaccines, contributing to 
1
the rapid, global scale up of manufacturing that is 
2
expected to reach at least 10,000,000,000 doses by 
3
the end of 2021. 
4
(6) The United States is a founding member of 
5
the World Trade Organization. The United States 
6
has secured and supported critical commitments in 
7
the WTO for protection of intellectual property of 
8
United States persons and globally, including under 
9
the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property 
10
Rights Agreement or the TRIPS Agreement. 
11
(7) In implementing the Uruguay Round, Con-
12
gress established under section 315 of the Uruguay 
13
Round Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. 3581) that it is 
14
the objective of the United States to ‘‘accelerate the 
15
implementation’’ of the TRIPS Agreement and to 
16
‘‘seek enactment and effective implementation by 
17
foreign countries of laws to protect and enforce in-
18
tellectual property rights that supplement and 
19
strengthen the standards’’ of the TRIPS Agreement. 
20
(8) Longstanding intellectual property protec-
21
tions are critical to efforts by the United States and 
22
the biopharmaceutical industry to develop and man-
23
ufacture vaccines for both people in the United 
24
States and around the world.

•HR 7430 IH
(9) The United States is committed to pro-
1
viding global access to COVID–19 vaccines. 
2
(10) In order to accelerate production and dis-
3
tribution of COVID–19 vaccines, biopharmaceutical 
4
manufacturers in the United States are collaborating 
5
at a scale that previously was unimaginable, includ-
6
ing by entering into hundreds of voluntary manufac-
7
turing, production, and other partnerships around 
8
the world. 
9
(11) Manufacturing each of the COVID–19 
10
vaccines involves highly specialized and unique infra-
11
structure and equipment, as well as highly trained 
12
and experienced personnel. Manufacturing and dis-
13
tributing safe and effective COVID–19 vaccines on 
14
a global scale is incredibly challenging. Many experts 
15
on vaccine production and distribution are warning 
16
that waiving intellectual property protections will un-
17
dermine the global response to the COVID–19 pan-
18
demic and compromise vaccine safety, including by 
19
disrupting the distribution of scarce raw materials 
20
for vaccines that existing vaccine makers with prov-
21
en track records for delivering high-quality, safe, 
22
and effective vaccines need to continue their own 
23
production.

•HR 7430 IH
(12) The United States Trade Representative 
1
announced without any consultation with Congress 
2
that the United States will support a waiver of intel-
3
lectual property protections under the TRIPS Agree-
4
ment for COVID–19 vaccines. That decision is not 
5
consistent with the intellectual property negotiating 
6
objectives of the United States set forth in section 
7
315 of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (19 
8
U.S.C. 3581). 
9
(13) That waiver announcement created confu-
10
sion, and raised concerns that a successful effort to 
11
suspend protections will weaken already strained 
12
supply chains and foster the proliferation of ineffec-
13
tive and potentially dangerous vaccines. 
14
(14) The Trade Representative has not ex-
15
plained how a waiver of the TRIPS Agreement will 
16
expand vaccine production and access, particularly 
17
considering that the major impediments to vaccina-
18
tion efforts include the following: 
19
(A) The difficulty in meeting the technical 
20
specifications of production and appropriately 
21
ensuring that finished vaccines are high-quality, 
22
safe, and effective. 
23
(B) The scarcity of raw materials for the 
24
vaccines.

•HR 7430 IH
(C) Last-mile distribution and cold-chain 
1
storage. 
2
(D) Trade barriers to the free flow of in-
3
puts and finished products. 
4
(15) The Government of the People’s Republic 
5
of China and the Government of the Russian Fed-
6
eration are engaged in large scale industrial espio-
7
nage and technology theft of intellectual property of 
8
United States persons. The Department of Justice 
9
has issued indictments in connection with attempts 
10
sponsored by the Government of the People’s Repub-
11
lic of China to steal United States vaccine research 
12
with respect to COVID–19. 
13
(16) The Government of the People’s Republic 
14
of China and the Government of the Russian Fed-
15
eration are using their vaccines as part of diplomatic 
16
efforts that may be contrary to the national security 
17
interests of the United States. Vaccines for COVID– 
18
19 manufactured by persons in the People’s Repub-
19
lic of China and the Russian Federation appear to 
20
be less efficacious than those manufactured by pro-
21
ducers in the United States. The Academy of Mili-
22
tary Science, the scientific arm of the military of the 
23
People’s Republic of China, is sponsoring the prin-
24

cipal effort by the People’s Republic of China to de-
1
velop its own mRNA vaccine. 
2
(17) At a hearing before the Committee on Fi-
3
nance of the Senate on May 12, 2021, the Trade 
4
Representative would not commit either— 
5
(A) to ensure that any waiver of the 
6
TRIPS Agreement would exclude the People’s 
7
Republic of China and the Russian Federation; 
8
or 
9
(B) to ensure that Congress has advance 
10
access to the negotiating proposals of the 
11
United States for any such waiver. 
12
(18) The innovative biopharmaceutical compa-
13
nies in the United States contribute more than 
14
$1,100,000,000,000 annually to the United States 
15
economy, and employ more than 500,000 workers 
16
making 1.4 times the average earnings in the United 
17
States, including 153,000 workers who do not have 
18
a college degree. 
19
(19) Waiving intellectual property protections, 
20
particularly of the mRNA technology platform in 
21
which the Defense Advanced Research Project Agen-
22
cy invested not less than $250,000,000, raises seri-
23
ous economic and national security concerns.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
1
It is the sense of Congress that— 
2
(1) the United States should continue to act as 
3
a global leader to help contain and end the COVID– 
4
19 pandemic at home and abroad; 
5
(2) innovators in the United States are already 
6
heroes for their breakthrough work in developing 
7
and producing COVID–19 vaccines; 
8
(3) it should be a priority of the global commu-
9
nity, with the assistance of the United States, to ef-
10
ficiently and quickly manufacture and distribute 
11
COVID–19 vaccines around the world, and in par-
12
ticular to those countries that are most vulnerable; 
13
(4) current impediments to further vaccination 
14
efforts are due to— 
15
(A) the technically difficult manufacturing 
16
requirements for vaccines; 
17
(B) the need to appropriately ensure that 
18
vaccines are high-quality, safe, and effective; 
19
(C) raw material constraints; and 
20
(D) difficulties in distribution; 
21
(5) 
intellectual 
property 
protections 
for 
22
COVID–19 vaccines have not impeded vaccination 
23
efforts for COVID–19;

•HR 7430 IH
(6) intellectual property protections in fact help 
1
ensure the safe and efficient manufacturing of 
2
COVID–19 vaccines; 
3
(7) waiving intellectual property protections 
4
could lead to the production of substandard, ineffec-
5
tive, and potentially unsafe COVID–19 vaccines; 
6
(8) the Trade Representative must consult with 
7
Congress before taking a position on the current 
8
TRIPS Agreement waiver proposal before the WTO 
9
and any further proposals to waive or weaken intel-
10
lectual property obligations under the TRIPS Agree-
11
ment; 
12
(9) Congress and the people of the United 
13
States are entitled to comprehensive expert analysis 
14
regarding the implications of a waiver to the TRIPS 
15
Agreement for jobs, economic growth, public health, 
16
and national security in the United States; and 
17
(10) the United States must oppose any waiver 
18
to intellectual property obligations under the TRIPS 
19
Agreement for the response to the COVID–19 pan-
20
demic until those implications are fully analyzed.
