RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the Congress that a commemorative 
postage stamp series should be issued honoring women 
veterans, and that the Citizens’ Stamp Advisory Com-
mittee should recommend to the Postmaster General that 
such a stamp series be issued. 
Whereas there are approximately two million women veterans 
living in the United States, who have served their Nation 
with honor and distinction, yet their service is often for-
gotten and they become ‘‘invisible veterans’’; 
Whereas such women have made invaluable contributions 
since the American Revolution;
