(3) The involvement of women in the Nation’s 
1
history is inadequately chronicled, commemorated, 
2
and celebrated as reflected in the following: 
3
(A) Fewer than 5 percent of the 2,596 na-
4
tional historic landmarks chronicle women’s 
5
achievements. 
6
(B) Only nine of the 112 statues in the 
7
Capitol’s Statuary Hall are of women. 
8
(C) The National Park Service notes that 
9
only three of the 130 national monuments in 
10
the United States are dedicated to historic fe-
11
male figures. 
12
(D) Of the 5,575 outdoor sculpture por-
13
traits of historical figures in the United States, 
14
559 portray women according to the Smithso-
15
nian American Art Museum’s online inventories 
16
catalog. 
17
(E) Six of the 89 National Historic Sites 
18
commemorate women. 
19
(F) Only 219 United States Postal Stamps 
20
were issued to commemorate women. 
21
(4) The National Women’s Hall of Fame will 
22
complete rehabilitation of its new home at the 
23
former Seneca Falls Knitting Mill, which is a his-
24
toric building included in the National Historic Reg-

istry. The new building has over 20,000 square feet 
1
available for artifacts to ensure that women’s history 
2
and women’s contribution to American history will 
3
be preserved and recounted for future generations.

(5) The National Women’s Hall of Fame plans 
5
to design an educational program utilizing video con-
6
ference technology with students and teachers par-
7
ticipating in interactive lessons led by educators 
8
from the National Women’s Hall of Fame. This pro-
9
gram will provide important lessons on the impact 
10
that women have had on mathematics, geography, 
11
education, sciences, medicine, military, government, 
12
civil rights, economics, industrial technology, arts, 
13
and communication.
