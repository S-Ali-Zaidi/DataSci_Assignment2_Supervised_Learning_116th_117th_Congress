SEC. 2. PURPOSE. 
1
The purpose of this Act is to structure means-tested 
2
welfare programs so that— 
3
(1) welfare programs work in an integrated 
4
manner and provide social workers with the tools to 
5
assist people holistically; 
6
(2) welfare programs work together in a 
7
streamlined and comprehensible manner, and, over 
8
time, individuals on such programs will earn enough 
9
income on their own to transition off of means-test-
10
ed welfare programs; and 
11
(3) means-tested welfare programs increase em-
12
ployment, encourage healthy families and further 
13
educational attainment so that households maintain 
14
an income above the poverty level without services 
15
and benefits from the Federal Government.
