SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) In 1948, George F. Kennan observed that, 
3
‘‘In broadest definition, political warfare is the em-
4
ployment of all the means at a nation’s command, 
5
short of war, to achieve its national objectives.’’. 
6
(2) Today, this coercive activity is referred to 
7
by many names within the United States Govern-
8
ment and the academic community, most notably 
9
‘‘gray zone’’ operations. 
10
(3) Although increasingly employed as a means 
11
of political warfare, the full contours of gray zone 
12
operations remain ambiguous. However, central fea-
13
tures of gray zone operations include that they are 
14
ultimately directed by state actors, consist of efforts 
15
not associated with routine statecraft, and are in-
16
tended to advance a country’s objectives at the ex-
17
pense of a rival, without crossing a threshold that 
18
results in kinetic military conflict. They include such 
19
operations and tactics as the following: 
20
(A) Information warfare, including con-
21
ducting 
disinformation 
campaigns 
or 
the 
22
spreading of propaganda.

(B) Encouraging internal strife within tar-
1
get countries. 
2
(C) Coordinated efforts to unduly influence 
3
democratic elections or related political activi-
4
ties. 
5
(D) Economic coercion. 
6
(E) Cyber operations, below the threshold 
7
of conflict, aimed at coercion, espionage, or oth-
8
erwise undermining a target. 
9
(F) Support of domestic or foreign proxy 
10
forces. 
11
(G) Coercive investment and bribery for 
12
political aims. 
13
(H) Industrial policy designed to monopo-
14
lize a strategic industry or to destroy such an 
15
industry in other nations, especially when co-
16
ordinated with other gray zone operations. 
17
(I) Military, paramilitary, or similar provo-
18
cations and operations short of war. 
19
(J) Government financing or sponsorship 
20
of activities described in subparagraphs (A) 
21
through (I). 
22
(4) Various gray zone operations are frequently 
23
linked together into a coordinated campaign, that 
24
may also include tools of routine diplomacy, and that 
25

•HR 9096 IH
is designed to achieve a state’s political or military 
1
objective. 
2
(5) Gray zone campaigns are attractive to state 
3
actors for several reasons, including reduced costs 
4
compared to the deployment of conventional forces, 
5
thereby allowing states to pursue their objectives 
6
with limited resources. 
7
(6) The People’s Republic of China, the Rus-
8
sian Federation, the Islamic Republic of Iran, and 
9
other countries actively advance their own strategic 
10
objectives and challenge United States interests 
11
through the extensive use of gray zone operations. 
12
(7) Unwelcome escalation by adversarial pow-
13
ers—especially over the last decade—from routine 
14
statecraft into gray zone competition is a defining 
15
feature of the recent reemergence of great-power 
16
competition and requires an appropriate United 
17
States response. 
18
(8) The United States has not sufficiently de-
19
terred or responded to gray zone campaigns, thereby 
20
risking undermining United States national inter-
21
ests, diminishing United States influence and credi-
22
bility, and encouraging rivals to further employ such 
23
tactics.

(9) Successfully responding to adversary gray 
1
zone campaigns relies upon the full integration of in-
2
struments of national power across multiple domains 
3
and the ability to deploy such capacities in a coordi-
4
nated, real-time campaign. 
5
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
6
It is the sense of Congress that— 
7
(1) gray zone competition is a central and en-
8
during aspect of great-power competition, and the 
9
United States should elevate the effective response 
10
to adversary gray zone campaigns as a central fea-
11
ture of its approach to great-power competition; 
12
(2) an effective, whole-of-government approach 
13
is essential to meeting the gray zone challenges 
14
posed by competitors of the United States; and 
15
(3) since gray zone activity takes place below 
16
the threshold of kinetic military conflict and since 
17
narrative formation is frequently a critical aspect of 
18
gray zone campaigns, the Department of State 
19
should take a preeminent role in coordinating, within 
20
applicable interagency processes, the disparate 
21
means of national power as the United States seeks 
22
to respond to adversary gray zone campaigns. 
23
SEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
24
It is the policy of the United States to— 
25

•HR 9096 IH
(1) seek effective responses, particularly at the 
1
Department of State, to adversary gray zone cam-

3
of such responses to the national interests of the 
4
United States; 
5
(2) continue upholding the international rule of 
6
law and the rules-based international order, which is 
7
a core national security interest of the United 
8
States; and 
9
(3) call on United States allies and partners to 
10
employ sufficient national resources to equitably con-
11
tribute to the response to gray zone challenges.
