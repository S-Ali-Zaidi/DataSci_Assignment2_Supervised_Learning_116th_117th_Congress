To authorize assistance to aid in the prevention and treat-
ment of obstetric fistula in foreign countries, and for 
other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 7869 IH
(1) Every two minutes, one woman dies from 
1
pregnancy-related complications. This means ap-
2
proximately 830 women die from pregnancy- or 
3
childbirth-related complications around the world 
4
every day. Of these deaths, 99 percent occur in de-
5
veloping countries. Over half of these deaths are in 
6
sub-Saharan Africa and one-third are in South Asia. 
7
(2) Obstetric fistula is one of the most severe 
8
and tragic pregnancy-related injuries, which occurs 
9
when a woman experiences prolonged, obstructed 
10
labor in the absence of trained medical assistance, 
11
which is most commonly a Caesarean section, nec-
12
essary for a safe delivery. 
13
(3) Obstetric fistula is a hole that is formed be-
14
tween the bladder and the vagina, or the rectum and 
15
the vagina (or both). In the struggle to pass through 
16
the birth canal, the fetus puts constant pressure, 
17
sometimes for several days, on the bladder and vag-
18
inal or rectal walls, destroying the tissue that then 
19
dies and sloughs off, resulting in the abnormal open-
20
ing or hole. 
21
(4) In approximately 90 percent of obstetric fis-
22
tula cases, the baby will be stillborn. A mother will 
23
experience physical pain and multiple physical dis-
24
abilities, as well as social and emotional trauma

from living with incontinence and from the loss of 
1
her child. 
2
(5) In addition to constant uncontrollable leak-
3
ing of urine, feces, or both, the physical conse-
4
quences of obstetric fistula may include frequent 
5
bladder infections, painful sores, kidney failure, in-
6
fertility, foul odor, orthopedic injury, and nerve 
7
damage that makes normal walking impossible and 
8
internal genital scarring that destroys normal sexual 
9
function. 
10
(6) Women and girls with obstetric fistula are 
11
commonly ostracized by their families and commu-
12
nities, leading to depression, anxiety, post-traumatic 
13
stress disorder, social isolation and discrimination, 
14
suicidal thoughts or actions, and lack of adequate 
15
economic opportunities, resulting in deepening pov-
16
erty, isolation, and vulnerability. 
17
(7) Although data on obstetric fistula is scarce, 
18
the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and 
19
Johns Hopkins University estimates that an esti-
20
mated 500,000 women and girls live with obstetric 
21
fistula with thousands more occurring annually. 
22
(8) Obstetric fistula was once common through-
23
out the world, but over the last century has been vir-
24
tually eliminated in Europe, North America, and 
25

other developed regions through improved access to 
1
high-quality, timely medical interventions, particu-
2
larly emergency obstetric care including Caesarean 
3
sections. 
4
(9) Obstetric fistula is preventable through 
5
timely medical interventions and providing access to 
6
family planning for all women who need it. Social 
7
interventions such as alleviating poverty, delaying 
8
early marriage and early childbearing, educating and 
9
empowering young women, remedying gender and 
10
socioeconomic inequalities, and addressing malnutri-
11
tion can also help prevent this complication. 
12
(10) The majority of obstetric fistula cases can 
13
be surgically treated. When performed by a skilled, 
14
competent surgeon, the procedure is relatively inex-
15
pensive with high rates of success. 
16
(11) In 2003, the UNFPA, EngenderHealth, 
17
and other partners launched a global Campaign to 
18
End Fistula (the Campaign) to identify and address 
19
obstetric fistula in an effort to develop a means to 
20
treat and support those women who are suffering 
21
and provide the necessary health services to prevent 
22
further cases. Operating in more than 55 countries 
23
across Africa, Asia, and the Arab region, the Cam-
24
paign has four main goals: the prevention of fistula 
25

•HR 7869 IH
cases, treatment of existing fistula cases, social re-
1
integration and follow up for fistula survivors, and 
2
advocacy for ending fistula. 
3
(12) In order to meet these goals, The Cam-
4
paign supports and participates in the emerging 
5
‘‘safe surgery’’ community of practice that strength-
6
ens surgical ecosystems in low- and middle-income 
7
countries (LMIC) towards better access to essential 
8
and life-saving surgeries, which includes improved 
9
training, equipment, supplies, infrastructure and 
10
health worker density for timely access to Caesarean 
11
sections and for environments that optimize out-
12
comes of fistula surgery. 
13
(13) Since 2003, UNFPA has directly sup-
14
ported more than 85,000 fistula repairs, with addi-
15
tional repairs supported by Campaign partners. 
16
(14) The COVID–19 pandemic caused over-
17
loaded health systems and reallocation of human and 
18
financial resources with disruptions to services re-
19
sulting in an undermining of the sexual and repro-
20
ductive health and rights of women and girls. Begin-
21
ning in 2020, Fistula repairs were widely halted or 
22
slowed down due to COVID–19, as they were 
23
deemed nonurgent and unsafe during the pandemic.

This may result in an increased backlog of fistula

cases.

(15) The United States Agency for Inter-
3
national Development (USAID), in accordance with 
4
the United States Government’s commitment to end-
5
ing preventable maternal and newborn deaths and 
6
disabilities, currently supports fistula treatment 
7
services in seven countries. As part of a comprehen-
8
sive approach, USAID addresses fistula prevention 
9
as well as reintegration support to women as they 
10
re-enter their community and family life after sur-
11
gery. Cumulatively, USAID fistula support has 
12
trained thousands of medical personnel and volun-
13
teers, including 350 fistula surgeons. Since 2004, 
14
more than 56,200 women have received fistula re-
15
pairs with USAID support. 
16
(16) The United States has committed to join-
17
ing multilateral efforts involving the United Nations 
18
and others to make progress toward achieving the 
19
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including 
20
through the Global Strategy for Women’s, Children’s 
21
and Adolescents’ Health (2016–2030). Eliminating 
22
obstetric fistula is key to achieving the SDGs’ vision 
23
of ‘‘leaving no one behind.’’.

•HR 7869 IH
(17) In his July 2020 report prepared for the 
1
General Assembly called Intensifying efforts to end 
2
obstetric fistula within a decade, United Nations 
3
Secretary General Antonio Guterres underscored the 
4
urgency around action to end fistula in the wake of 
5
the COVID–19 pandemic, noting that ‘‘the pan-
6
demic caused by COVID–19 has disrupted health 
7
services 
and 
exacerbated 
gender-based, 
socio-
8
economic and intersectional inequalities. The health 
9
of women and girls, in particular those in fragile 
10
contexts, is adversely affected by the reallocation of 
11
resources and priorities. Essential health services in-
12
cluding contraception and emergency obstetric care 
13
remain critical to prevent maternal mortality and 
14
fistula. Since fistula surgery is considered to be elec-
15
tive care and, therefore, suspended during the pan-
16
demic to protect the safety of patients, new strate-
17
gies will be required in the post-COVID–19 recovery 
18
period to address the expected backlog of cases.’’.

10
suring that all women who need a Caesarean section 
11
are able to have access to such life-saving surgery in 
12
a timely, safe, and high-quality care environment, 
13
and address the growing threat of iatrogenic fistula 
14
that most often results from Caesarean delivery done 
15
poorly and under conditions with inadequate staff, 
16
supplies, or equipment.
