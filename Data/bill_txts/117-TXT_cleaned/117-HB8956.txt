SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘FedRAMP Authoriza-
2
tion Act’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) Ensuring that the Federal Government can 
6
securely leverage cloud computing products and serv-
7
ices is key to expediting the modernization of legacy 
8
information technology systems, increasing cyberse-
9
curity within and across departments and agencies, 
10
and supporting the continued leadership of the 
11
United States in technology innovation and job cre-
12
ation. 
13
(2) According to independent analysis, as of 
14
calendar year 2019, the size of the cloud computing 
15
market had tripled since 2004, enabling more than 
16
2,000,000 
jobs 
and 
adding 
more 
than 
17
$200,000,000,000 to the gross domestic product of 
18
the United States. 
19
(3) The Federal Government, across multiple 
20
presidential administrations and Congresses, has 
21
continued to support the ability of agencies to move 
22
to the cloud, including through— 
23
(A) President Barack Obama’s ‘‘Cloud 
24
First Strategy’’; 
25
3 
•HR 8956 EH
(B) President Donald Trump’s ‘‘Cloud 
1
Smart Strategy’’; 
2
(C) the prioritization of cloud security in 
3
Executive Order No. 14028 (86 Fed. Reg. 
4
26633; relating to improving the nation’s cyber-
5
security), which was issued by President Joe 
6
Biden; and 
7
(D) more than a decade of appropriations 
8
and authorization legislation that provides 
9
agencies with relevant authorities and appro-
10
priations to modernize on-premises information 
11
technology systems and more readily adopt 
12
cloud computing products and services. 
13
(4) Since it was created in 2011, the Federal 
14
Risk and Authorization Management Program (re-
15
ferred to in this section as ‘‘FedRAMP’’) at the 
16
General Services Administration has made steady 
17
and sustained improvements in supporting the se-
18
cure authorization and reuse of cloud computing 
19
products and services within the Federal Govern-
20
ment, including by reducing the costs and burdens 
21
on both agencies and cloud companies to quickly and 
22
securely enter the Federal market. 
23
(5) According to data from the General Services 
24
Administration, as of the end of fiscal year 2021, 
25
4 
•HR 8956 EH
there were 239 cloud providers with FedRAMP au-
1
thorizations, and those authorizations had been re-
2
used more than 2,700 times across various agencies. 
3
(6) Providing a legislative framework for 
4
FedRAMP and new authorities to the General Serv-
5
ices Administration, the Office of Management and 
6
Budget, and Federal agencies will— 
7
(A) improve the speed at which new cloud 
8
computing products and services can be se-
9
curely authorized; 
10
(B) enhance the ability of agencies to ef-
11
fectively evaluate FedRAMP authorized pro-
12
viders for reuse; 
13
(C) reduce the costs and burdens to cloud 
14
providers seeking a FedRAMP authorization; 
15
and 
16
(D) provide for more robust transparency 
17
and dialogue between industry and the Federal 
18
Government to drive stronger adoption of se-
19
cure cloud capabilities, create jobs, and reduce 
20
wasteful legacy information technology.
