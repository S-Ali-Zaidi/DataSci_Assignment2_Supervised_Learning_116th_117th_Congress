Recognizing the importance of the blueberry industry to the 
United States and supporting the designation of July 
2021 as National Blueberry Month.

portant United States agricultural industry; 
Whereas highbush blueberries have a harvested area esti-
mated at 102,700 acres and are produced in 48 States

Whereas highbush blueberry production in the United States 
increased, with particular growth in the past two years, 
to reach a harvest of 680,700,000 pounds in 2019; 
Whereas blueberries are low in fat, and a source of fiber, vi-
tamins, and minerals; 
Whereas blueberries are being studied to examine the role 
they may play in promoting good health in areas such as 
cardiovascular health, brain health, exercise, insulin re-
sponse, and gut health; and 
Whereas highbush blueberries are harvested in the United 
States from April through September, with the harvest 
reaching its peak in July: Now, therefore, be it
