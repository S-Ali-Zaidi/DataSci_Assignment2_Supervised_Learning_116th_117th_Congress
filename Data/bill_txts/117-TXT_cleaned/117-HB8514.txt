SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
1
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Certain cetaceans, namely orcas, beluga 
3
whales, false killer whales, and pilot whales are 
4
large-brained mammals who engage in creative prob-
5
lem solving, intentional communication, show signs 
6
of empathy for others and complex emotions, and 
7
form lifelong bonds. 
8
(2) Science increasingly supports that the spe-
9
cies listed in paragraph (1) suffer in captivity. They 
10
die prematurely, engage in stereotypic behavior that 
11
is indicative of suffering and distress, are held in 
12
barren tanks, and are sometimes isolated from mem-
13
bers of their own species, among other harms. 
14
(3) Current Federal laws allow the species list-
15
ed in paragraph (1) to be confined in concrete tanks 
16
that fail to meet their basic psychological, physical, 
17
and social needs. 
18
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
19
gress that the species listed in paragraph (1) of subsection 
20
(a) should not be subject to restraint, coercion, or control 
21
by any person for purposes of public display.

SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON EXPORTATION, TAKING, AND IM-

24
(a) PROHIBITION ON EXPORTATION.—Section 102 of

5
cies— 
6
‘‘(A) to a marine mammal sanctuary with a de-
7
termination by the Secretary that the transportation 
8
to such sanctuary is in the best interest of the indi-
9
vidual marine mammal; or 
10
‘‘(B) for release to the wild. 
11
‘‘(2) In this subsection, the term ‘sanctuary’ means 
12
a place of refuge where marine mammals— 
13
‘‘(A) live in a captive setting as close as possible 
14
to their natural environment; 
15
‘‘(B) are prioritized individually with respect to 
16
well-being and autonomy; and 
17
‘‘(C) are not used for profit or breeding for the 
18
purpose of public display.’’.

6
er whale, or pilot whale for the purpose of public display.
