CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 
Declaring a state of emergency due to the Russian invasion 
of Ukraine, in order to establish a waiver of the min-
imum tonnage requirements of section 55305 of title 
46, United States Code. 
Whereas, in March and April 2014, the Russian military in-
vaded and annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea, 
and the Russian Federation took action to establish pro- 
Russian separatist states in the Donbas region of 
Ukraine; 
Whereas the Russian Federation has failed to follow the 
cease-fire agreements established by the Minsk 1 and 
Minsk 2 accords, and conflict has been present in 
Ukraine since such invasion and annexation;

Whereas, throughout 2021, Russia amassed troops, weapon 
systems, and hardware on the border of Russia and 
Ukraine; 
Whereas, on December 17, 2021, the Russian Federation 
presented the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (re-
ferred to in this preamble as ‘‘NATO’’) with a list of se-
curity demands, including that NATO would never allow 
Ukraine, or other former Soviet states, into the alliance; 
Whereas such demands are non-starters for NATO and its 
‘‘open door policy’’, which dates to the alliance’s founding 
and gives no third party a say in such deliberations, and 
such demands were only offered as a justification for a 
Russian invasion; 
Whereas, on February 21, 2022, President Vladimir Putin 
officially recognized the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk 
as independent states despite international consensus 
that those regions remain part of the sovereign territory 
of Ukraine; 
Whereas, on February 22, 2022, President Putin ordered 
Russian troops to enter Donetsk and Luhansk on a 
‘‘peacekeeping mission’’ while setting the stage for a larg-
er invasion; 
Whereas, on February 24, 2022, President Putin ordered 
Russian forces to conduct a full-scale invasion, moving 
beyond the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, and initi-
ating attacks throughout broader Ukrainian territory; 
Whereas Russian forces continue to devastate Ukraine’s hos-
pitals, schools, homes, and other civilian infrastructure, 
and threaten nuclear power plants with heavy artillery, 
multi-launch rocket systems, and munitions systems, with 
no regard for civilian casualties;

Whereas an October 19, 2017, Government Accountability 
Office Report stated that a ‘‘2015 analysis of agency 
data found that the application of [cargo preference for 
food aid] requirements increased United States Agency 
for International Development’s and United States De-
partment of Agriculture’s costs for shipping food aid by 
about 23 percent, or $107 million, compared with the es-
timated shipping costs without application of CPFA re-
quirements, from April 2011 through fiscal year 2014.’’; 
Whereas in a United States Agency for International Devel-
opment fact sheet titled: ‘‘Food Aid Reform: Behind the 
Numbers’’, the United States Agency for International 
Development stated that eliminating the mandatory cargo 
preference reimbursements will reduce the deficit by an 
estimated $50,000,000 per year; 
Whereas, in March 2020, the American Enterprise Institute 
published a report titled ‘‘The Cost of Cargo Preferences 
for International Food Aid Programs’’, which— 
(1) found ‘‘that removing cargo preference require-
ments would allow for between $36 and $64 million of al-
ready appropriated funds to go to feeding the hungry and 
would benefit U.S. soft power globally’’; and 
(2) concluded that ‘‘cargo preference for food aid 
imposes substantial costs of USAID’s Title II program 
budget . . . The impacts are substantial, reducing the 
funds available for additional food aid programs by 
$52.83 million a year.’’; 
Whereas in a March 25, 2022, information note titled ‘‘The 
importance of Ukraine and the Russian Federation for 
global agricultural markets and the risks associated with 
the current conflict’’, the Food and Agriculture Organiza-

tion (referred to in this preamble as the ‘‘FAO’’) of the 
United Nations stated that— 
(1) the invasion of Ukraine could raise food prices 
‘‘by 8 to 22 percent above their already elevated baseline 
levels’’; 
(2) ‘‘current indications are that, as a result of the 
conflict, between 20 and 30 percent of areas sown to win-
ter crops in Ukraine will remain unharvested during the 
2022/23 season, with the yields of these crops also likely 
to be adversely affected’’; and 
(3) ‘‘FAO’s simulations suggest that under such a 
scenario, the global number of undernourished people 
could increase by 8 to 13 million people in 2022/23, with 
the most pronounced increases taking place in Asia-Pa-
cific, followed by sub-Saharan Africa, and the Near East 
and North Africa.’’; 
Whereas, on April 8, 2022, the Associated Press published 
that ‘‘The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization said 
its Food Price Index, which tracks monthly changes in 
international prices for a basket of commodities, averaged 
159.3 points last month, up 12.6% from February’’, and 
that ‘‘As it is, the February index was the highest level 
since its inception in 1990.’’; 
Whereas, on April 27, 2022, the United States Agency for 
International Development said in a press release that 
‘‘The world is suffering from historic levels of global food 
insecurity, which is being exacerbated by the impact Rus-
sia’s war on Ukraine is having on global food supplies. 
Available estimates suggest that an additional 40 million 
people could be pushed into poverty and food insecurity 
as a result of Russia’s aggression.’’;

Whereas, on April 27, 2022, the Administrator of the United 
States Agency for International Development, Samantha 
Power, said that ‘‘In Ukraine, which provides 10 percent 
of the world’s wheat, farmers are struggling to plant and 
harvest their crops for fear of shelling and Russian land-
mines, and their path to exporting these vital commod-
ities is severely restricted by Russia’s invasion, which 
caused the closure of Ukraine’s ports.’’; and 
Whereas, on April 27, 2022, Secretary of Agriculture Tom 
Vilsack, said that ‘‘Russia’s unprovoked war on Ukraine, 
a fellow major agricultural export country, is driving food 
and energy costs higher for people around the world.’’: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate 
1
concurring), That— 
2
(1) a state of emergency exists due to the Rus-
3
sian invasion of Ukraine; 
4
(2) such state of emergency— 
5
(A) for the purposes of subparagraph (B), 
6
shall be in effect beginning on May 1, 2022, 
7
and ending on February 1, 2025; and 
8
(B) justifies a waiver during such period of 
9
time of the minimum tonnage requirements, in 
10
accordance with section 55305(c) of title 46, 
11
United States Code, for the transport of equip-
12
ment, materials, or commodities related to hu-
13
