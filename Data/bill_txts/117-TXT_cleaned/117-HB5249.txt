A BILL 
To amend the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch 
Act to establish a pilot program to provide selected 
States with an increased reimbursement for school 
lunches that are comprised of locally grown foods, and 
for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Small Farm to School 
4
Act of 2021’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. 
6
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:

•HR 5249 IH
(1) Across the United States, school food serv-
1
ice directors of school lunch programs face very tight 
2
budgets, and many find it challenging to shift their 
3
procurement practices without additional support. 
4
(2) One way to encourage school food service 
5
directors to procure more locally produced foods is 
6
to offer reimbursements to provide financial incen-
7
tives for purchases and ease the process of shifting 
8
existing procurement practices. 
9
(3) Research suggests that providing financial 
10
incentives to school food service directors for pur-
11
chasing of locally produced foods, can result in an 
12
overall positive economic effect for farmers and local 
13
economies. 
14
(4) In one such study, Cornell University re-
15
searchers found that providing an additional $0.05- 
16
per-lunch subsidy incentive to school food service di-
17
rectors in New York State that use local fruits or 
18
vegetables one day per week would have an overall 
19
positive economic effect for farmers and local econo-
20
mies. 
21
(5) In a report on Michigan’s ‘‘10 Cents a Meal 
22
for School Kids and Farms’’ State pilot program, re-
23
searchers found that providing schools with up to 
24
$0.10-per-meal in incentive match funding to pur-
25

•HR 5249 IH
chase and serve Michigan-grown fruits, vegetables, 
1
and dry beans resulted in an overall positive eco-
2
nomic effect for the State’s economy, doubling the 
3
investment of such State in the program. 
4
(b) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act is to provide 
5
incentives for school food service directors of school lunch 
6
programs to increase purchases of locally produced, proc-
7
essed, and unprocessed foods from small farmers, thereby 
8
providing healthier lunches for children and creating a 
9
positive economic effect for small farmers and local econo-
10
mies.
