To rename the Provo Veterans Center in Orem, Utah, as

1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF THE GAIL S. HALVORSEN 
3
‘‘CANDY BOMBER’’ VETERANS CENTER. 
4
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) Gail Halvorsen was born in Salt Lake City, 
6
Utah, on October 10, 1920, and spent his youth 
7
with his family on small farms in Utah and Idaho. 
8
(2) After a brief stint at Utah State University, 
9
Gail Halvorsen joined the Civilian Pilot Training

Program where he earned his pilot’s license in 1941. 
1
During that same year, Halvorsen joined the Civil 
2
Air Patrol as a pilot. 
3
(3) Gail Halvorsen joined the United States 
4
Army Air Corps in 1942 and trained flying fighter 
5
jets with the Royal Air Force. Upon his return from 
6
training, he was assigned to fly transport missions 
7
in the South Atlantic Theater. 
8
(4) After World War II and the division of Ber-
9
lin into occupation zones, disputes broke out between 
10
the Western Allies and the Soviet Union over the fu-
11
ture of Europe. 
12
(5) Negotiations deteriorated, and in June of 
13
1948 Soviet forces locked down all land routes con-
14
necting Western Germany with the allied portions of 
15
Berlin. Approximately 2,000,000 people in West 
16
Berlin were left completely isolated. Starvation, pov-
17
erty, and desperate want ensued. 
18
(6) In an effort to alleviate the immense human 
19
suffering, the allies decided to drop supplies to peo-
20
ple of West Berlin from the air until a diplomatic 
21
solution to the blockade could be reached. Termed 
22
by United States forces ‘‘Operation Vittles’’, the 
23
Berlin Airlift began on June 26, 1948.

(7) Gail Halvorsen was assigned to Germany in 
1
1948 to work as an airlift pilot where he flew C–47 
2
and C–54 cargo planes as part of Operation Vittles. 
3
(8) While on mission at Tempelhof Airport in 
4
Berlin, Halvorsen noticed a group of German chil-
5
dren standing just outside the barb wire fence. 
6
(9) The children were destitute and clearly had 
7
very little to eat. Halvorsen gave the children two 
8
sticks of gum he had in his pocket, which they split 
9
into little pieces to share among themselves. 
10
(10) Colonel Halvorsen was deeply affected by 
11
the experience and wanted to do more to help. He 
12
promised the children he would drop more candy to 
13
them from his plane as he flew his regular airlift 
14
missions. 
15
(11) Halvorsen told the children they would rec-
16
ognize his plane by a back-and-forth waggle of his 
17
wings as he flew over. 
18
(12) Colonel Halvorsen enlisted his copilot and 
19
engineer in the project and began attaching their 
20
candy rations to miniature parachutes which they 
21
dropped from their plane to the starving children 
22
below. 
23
(13) The children of Berlin gave Halvorsen 
24
many nicknames including ‘‘Uncle Wiggly Wings’’, 
25

‘‘The Chocolate Flier’’, ‘‘The Gum Drop Kid’’, and 
1
‘‘The Chocolate Uncle’’. He eventually became 
2
known around the world as ‘‘The Candy Bomber’’. 
3
(14) Lieutenant General William H. Turner, 
4
who directed the Berlin Airlift, learned about 
5
Halvorsen’s efforts and officially expanded the idea 
6
into a full-blown operation known as ‘‘Little Vittles’’ 
7
as a play on the broader operation’s name. 
8
(15) As the candy drops continued, word of Op-
9
eration Little Vittles reached the United States. 
10
Families, schoolchildren, and candymakers in the 
11
United States began contributing candy and home-
12
made parachutes that Halvorsen and other pilots 
13
could drop. 
14
(16) When the Berlin Airlift ended, an esti-
15
mated 250,000 parachutes containing approximately 
16
21 tons of candy had been dropped by Halvorsen 
17
and his fellow airmen as a part of Operation Little 
18
Vittles. 
19
(17) Halvorsen retired from the military in 
20
1974 after 31 years of service and more than 8,000 
21
hours of flying time. 
22
(18) Since his retirement, Halvorson has con-
23
tinued his humanitarian service. He has voluntarily 
24
represented the United States Air Force and the 
25

United States abroad and has re-enacted his famous 
1
candy drops several times in Berlin and around the 
2
world. 
3
(19) Halvorsen has also been a tremendous 
4
boon to his community through church service and 
5
other local contributions. 
6
(20) Gail Halvorsen turned 100 years old on 
7
October 10, 2020.

9
the Department of Veterans Affairs located at 360 State 
10
Street, Orem, Utah, shall after the date of the enactment 
11
of this Act be known and designated as the ‘‘Gail S. 
12
Halvorsen ‘Candy Bomber’ Veterans Center’’.

14
tion, map, document, paper, or other record of the United
