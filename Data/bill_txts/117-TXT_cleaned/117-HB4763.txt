A BILL 
To direct the Secretary of Agriculture to carry out a program 
to award grants to eligible entities to carry out projects 
that further agricultural resiliency and modernization, 
and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Future of Agricultural

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 4763 IH
(1) The evidence for human-induced climate 
1
change is undeniable and our agricultural commu-
2
nities are increasingly experiencing the impacts of 
3
climate change. 
4
(2) The volatility of weather patterns, ranging 
5
from more frequent and severe droughts, floods, and 
6
wildfires can negatively impact agricultural produc-
7
tivity. 
8
(3) Rural communities, that often lack Federal 
9
and State resources, are especially vulnerable to the 
10
impacts of climate change, such as revenue losses, 
11
hours lost at work, and infrastructure damages. 
12
(4) Climate resilient practices and technologies 
13
are needed to help save Federal, State, and local 
14
taxpayers money. These technologies include manure 
15
resource recovery systems, which recover the nutri-
16
ents contained in organic matter from their source 
17
help protect water quality. 
18
(5) The need for measures that promote energy 
19
and water use efficiency, conservation, and renew-
20
able energy will greatly reduce the adverse impacts 
21
of climate change. 
22
(6) Many farmers and agricultural producers 
23
are currently utilizing environmentally beneficial 
24
practices that also better their production costs.

(7) Excessive heat exposure poses a direct 
1
threat to farm workers and the economy. Climate 
2
change increases this danger, as 18 of the 19 hottest 
3
years on record have occurred since 2001. Rising 
4
temperatures are projected to cause an increase in 
5
heat-related workplace injuries, illnesses, loss in 
6
labor capacity, and decreased productivity. In light 
7
of these findings, the Federal Government has an 
8
obligation to protect farmworkers, outdoor workers, 
9
and employers in the United States from climate 
10
change. 
11
(8) The Department of Agriculture should use 
12
research and development programs to make dairy 
13
digesters more affordable while mitigating environ-
14
mental effects. Further, the Department should pro-
15
vide technical assistance, community support, and fi-
16
nancial incentives and grants for farmers to partner 
17
together to build cooperative digester models. The 
18
Department should use cross-agency collaborative 
19
models and utilize existing Federal programs, such 
20
as the Environmental Protection Agency’s AgSTAR 
21
program to increase farmer access and engagement 
22
in these efforts. 
23
(9) The Department should engage in partner-
24
ships with other Federal agencies to control invasive

species, in a manner that protects the environment,

infrastructure, and agricultural lands in the United 
2
States.

(10) Federal assistance is needed to help farm-
4
ing practices become more resilient and sustainable 
5
for the long-term.
