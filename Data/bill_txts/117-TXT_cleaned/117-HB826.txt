SEC. 2. CONSULTATIONS ON REUNITING KOREAN AMERI-
1
CANS WITH FAMILY MEMBERS IN NORTH 
2
KOREA. 
3
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following find-
4
ings: 
5
(1) The division of the Korean Peninsula into 
6
South Korea and North Korea separated thousands 
7
of Koreans from family members. 
8
(2) Since the signing of the Agreement Con-
9
cerning a Military Armistice in Korea, signed at 
10
Panmunjom July 27, 1953 (commonly referred to as 
11
the ‘‘Korean War Armistice Agreement’’), there has 
12
been little to no contact between Korean Americans 
13
and family members who remain in North Korea. 
14
(3) North Korea and South Korea first agreed 
15
to reunions of divided families in 1985 and have 
16
since held 21 face-to-face reunions and multiple 
17
video link reunions. 
18
(4) Those reunions have subsequently given ap-
19
proximately 24,500 Koreans the opportunity to 
20
briefly reunite with loved ones. 
21
(5) The most recent family reunions between 
22
North Korea and South Korea took place in August 
23
2018 and did not include any Korean Americans. 
24
(6) The United States and North Korea do not 
25
maintain diplomatic relations and certain limitations

•HR 826 IH
exist on Korean Americans participating in face-to- 
1
face reunions. 
2
(7) According to the most recent census, more 
3
than 1,700,000 people living in the United States 
4
are of Korean descent. 
5
(8) The number of first generation Korean and 
6
Korean American family members divided from fam-
7
ily members in North Korea is rapidly diminishing 
8
given the advanced age of those family members. 
9
More than 3,000 elderly South Koreans die each 
10
year without having been reunited with their family 
11
members. 
12
(9) Many Korean Americans with family mem-
13
bers in North Korea have not seen or communicated 
14
with those family members in more than 60 years. 
15
(10) The inclusion of Korean American families 
16
in the reunion process, with the support of inter-
17
national organizations with expertise in family trac-
18
ing, would constitute a positive humanitarian ges-
19
ture by the Government of North Korea. 
20
(11) Section 1265 of the National Defense Au-
21
thorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 (Public Law 
22
110–181; 122 Stat. 407) required the President to 
23
submit to Congress a report on ‘‘efforts, if any, of 
24
the United States Government to facilitate family re-

unions between United States citizens and their rel-
1
atives in North Korea’’. 
2
(12) The position of Special Envoy on North 
3
Korean Human Rights Issues has been vacant since 
4
January 2017, although the President is required to 
5

6
position in accordance with section 107 of the North 
7
Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 (22 U.S.C.

7817).

10

11
panying H.R. 3081, 111th Congress (House Report 
12
111–187), the Committee urged ‘‘the Special Rep-
13
resentative on North Korea Policy, as the senior of-
14
ficial handling North Korea issues, to prioritize the 
15
