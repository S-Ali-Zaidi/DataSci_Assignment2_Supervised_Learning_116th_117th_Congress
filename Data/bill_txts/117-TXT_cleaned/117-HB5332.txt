SEC. 2. SOLAR COMPONENT MANUFACTURING SUPPLY 
1
CHAIN ASSISTANCE. 
2
(a) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds that it is in the 
3
interest of the United States— 
4
(1) to have a viable solar component manufac-
5
turing supply chain; and 
6
(2) to reduce the reliance of United States 
7
manufacturers on solar components made in China. 
8
(b) ESTABLISHMENT.—Not later than 180 days after 
9
the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall es-
10
tablish and carry out a program to award grants and loans 
11
to eligible entities to carry out projects in the United 
12
States for— 
13
(1) the construction of new facilities that manu-
14
facture solar components; and 
15
(2) retooling, retrofitting, or expanding existing 
16
facilities that manufacture solar components. 
17
(c) PRIORITIZATION.—In awarding grants and loans 
18
under the program, the Secretary shall give priority to 
19
projects— 
20
(1) that are strategically located near manufac-

(A) provide the greatest potential for both 
5
direct and indirect domestic job creation; 
6
(B) result in economic development or eco-
7
nomic diversification in economically distressed 
8
