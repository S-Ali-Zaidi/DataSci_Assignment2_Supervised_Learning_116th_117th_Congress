•HR 1763 IH
(1) The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (Public 
1
Law 115–123) improved program accountability for 
2
effectively serving unemployed workers and made a 
3
significant new investment in reemployment services. 
4
(2) Research shows the longer workers are out 
5
of work, the harder it can be to maintain their skills, 
6
professional network, and stable home life. 
7
(3) Reemployment services give workers who 
8
might otherwise struggle to find new jobs the tools 
9
that they need to get back to work—such as individ-
10
ualized career counseling and job search help as well 
11
as local labor market information—and they can 
12
serve as an entry point to the workforce development 
13
system. 
14
(4) Reemployment services have been dem-
15
onstrated to reduce the number of weeks that pro-
16
gram participants receive unemployment benefits by 
17
improving their employment outcomes, including 
18
earnings. 
19
(5) State unemployment benefits replace less 
20
than half of working income, on average, so workers 
21
who find new jobs quickly suffer less financial hard-
22
ship. 
23
(6) Combining targeted reemployment services 
24
with unemployment benefits helps keep people at-

tached to the labor force who might otherwise be-
1
come discouraged and drop out. 
2
(7) The Congressional Budget Office estimates 
3
that, over time, investments in reemployment serv-
4
ices create savings for taxpayers and unemployment 
5
trust funds by reducing spending on unemployment 
6
benefits. 
7
(8) Many different types of workers can benefit 
8
from reemployment services. Reemployment services 
9
should be used to shorten the duration of unemploy-
10
ment for workers even if they are not projected to 
11
fully exhaust their unemployment benefits.

14
506(a)) is amended— 
15
(1) by striking ‘‘individuals referred to reem-
16
ployment services as described in section 303(j)’’ 
17
and inserting ‘‘claimants for unemployment com-
18
pensation, including claimants referred to reemploy-
19
ment services as described in section 303(j),’’; and 
20
(2) by striking ‘‘such individuals’’ and inserting 
21
