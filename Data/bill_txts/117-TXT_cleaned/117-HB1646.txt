A BILL 
To require the Secretary of the Treasury to instruct the 
United States Executive Director at the World Bank 
and other international financial institutions to support 
assistance for nuclear energy, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘International Nuclear

Energy Financing Act of 2021’’.

The Congress finds as follows:

(1) Nuclear power provides clean energy with 
1
greater reliability than wind or solar energy, and 
2
with comparable life cycle greenhouse gas emissions. 
3
(2) According to W. Gyude Moore, the former 
4
Minister of Public Works for Liberia, ‘‘Obstacles to 
5
the financing of nuclear power in emerging econo-
6
mies work to prevent countries like my own from in-
7
dustrializing our economies and building climate-re-
8
silient infrastructure. This is especially bad timing 
9
as the next generation of nuclear technologies, in-
10
cluding small modular reactors and microreactors, 
11
are especially suitable to emerging markets. Such re-
12
strictions are an example of climate injustice, not a 
13
reaction against it.’’. 
14
(3) The People’s Republic of China and the 
15
Russian Federation have sought to export nuclear 
16
reactors to Europe, Eurasia, Latin America, and 
17
South Asia using technologies which, according to a 
18
2017 study by Columbia University’s Center on 
19
Global Energy Policy, are associated with higher 
20
safety risk than American and Japanese reactor de-
21
signs. 
22
(4) In a 2019 letter to congressional leaders, 38 
23
national security experts emphasized the importance 
24
of nuclear energy finance to counter Chinese and

Russian ambitions, writing: ‘‘In the nuclear energy 
1
sector, the initial supply of a reactor typically leads 
2
to the supplier’s involvement throughout the hun-
3
dred-year life of the nuclear program, enabling long- 
4
term influence on nuclear safety, security and non-
5
proliferation, as well as the ability to advance energy 
6
security and broader foreign policy interests.’’.

(5) As Rafael Mariano Grossi, Director General 
8
of the International Atomic Energy Agency, wrote in 
9
Climate Change and Nuclear Power 2020, ‘‘Nuclear 
10
power, currently being generated in 30 countries, is 
11
already reducing carbon dioxide emissions by about 
12
two gigatons per year. That is the equivalent of tak-
13
ing more than 400 million cars off the road—every 
14
year.’’. He continued, ‘‘Nuclear power now provides 
15
about 10 percent of the world’s electricity, but it 
16
contributes almost 30 percent of all low carbon elec-
17
tricity. Nuclear power will be essential for achieving 
18
the low carbon future which world leaders have 
19
agreed to strive for.’’.
