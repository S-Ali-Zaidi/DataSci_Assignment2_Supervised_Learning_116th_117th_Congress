Whereas under the leadership of President Luis Abinader, 
who took office on August 16, 2020, the Government of 
the Dominican Republic has taken steps to effectively ad-
dress the COVID–19 pandemic, fully vaccinating over 60 
percent of its adult population, one of the highest vac-
cination rates in Latin America and the Caribbean, and 
acquiring sufficient surplus vaccines to provide donations 
to other countries in the region; 
Whereas in response to the COVID–19 pandemic, the Gov-
ernment of the Dominican Republic has committed to 
working with the United States, other Group of 7 coun-

gional post-pandemic economic recovery efforts;

ture; 
Whereas the Government of the Dominican Republic has 
committed to strengthening security cooperation with the 
United States to address the threats posed by 
transnational criminal organizations and human traf-
ficking, drug trafficking, and money laundering networks; 
Whereas a humanitarian crisis, rampant crime, gang violence, 
and instability in neighboring Haiti, a situation exacer-
bated by the July 7, 2021, assassination of President 
Jovenel Moise, has deepened the suffering of the Haitian 
people, increased risks to the Dominican Republic posed 
by organized criminal groups along its borders, and 
strained the economic capacity of the Government of the 
Dominican Republic to address the humanitarian needs 
of Haitian migrants; 
Whereas President Abinader has taken significant steps to 
make the Government of the Dominican Republic more 
accountable and effective, including by addressing corrup-
tion and impunity, appointing an independent Public 
Prosecutor, requiring additional transparency in public 
procurement, and proposing legislation to modernize 
asset forfeiture laws;
