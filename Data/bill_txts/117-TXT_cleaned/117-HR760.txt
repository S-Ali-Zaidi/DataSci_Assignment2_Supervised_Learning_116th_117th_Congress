RESOLUTION 
Expressing solidarity with Cuban citizens demonstrating 
peacefully for fundamental freedoms, condemning the 
Cuban regime’s acts of repression, and calling for the 
immediate release of arbitrarily detained Cuban citizens. 
Whereas, on July 11, 2021, thousands of Cubans took to the 
streets to express their dissatisfaction with Cuba’s contin-
ued repression of its people, its worsening economic situ-
ation, and shortages of food and medicine; 
Whereas these demonstrations were the largest protests on 
the island in over 25 years, with courageous Cuban men, 
women, and youth taking to the streets in cities and 
towns across the country;

Whereas the Cuban regime arbitrarily denied a request to 
allow a peaceful demonstration on November 15, 2021, 
which the organizers have specified would be ‘‘against vi-
olence, to demand that all the rights of all Cubans be re-
spected, for the release of political prisoners and for the 
solution of our differences through democratic and peace-
ful means’’; 
Whereas the Cuban regime also denied an earlier request for 
protests to be held on November 20, 2021, stating that 
date was off-limits because it would conflict with ‘‘na-
tional defense day’’ and claiming without evidence that 
‘‘subversive organizations’’ with links to the United 
States Government were promoting the protest; 
Whereas artists, academics, activists, and journalists have 
been long engaged in ongoing protests calling for an end 
to Cuba’s persecution, censorship, arbitrary detention, 
and other human rights violations; 
Whereas expanded internet access is foundational for the 
Cuban people to be able to exercise their internationally 
recognized human rights of access to information and 
freedom of expression, creating opportunities for Cubans 
to communicate more openly with one another and for 
their voices to be heard around the world; 
Whereas numerous public reports and first-hand accounts re-
vealed that the Cuban regime deliberately blocked access 
to certain websites and messaging apps, throttled inter-
net access, and launched targeted attacks to disrupt the 
internet connections of private Cuban citizens; 
Whereas during the July protests, regime security officials 
physically assaulted domestic and international journal-
ists, including Associated Press correspondent Ramon

Espinosa, and prevented dozens of reporters from leaving 
their homes to report on the protests, according to the 
Committee to Protect Journalists; 
Whereas Cuba is among the most restrictive countries in the 
world for journalists, ranked 171 of 180 countries in Re-
porters Without Borders’ 2021 World Press Freedom 
Index; 
Whereas Cuban human rights groups report there were al-
ready at least 150 political prisoners in Cuba before the 
July 11 protests, and Cuba has reportedly been respon-
sible for over 400 additional arrests or forced disappear-
ances since then; 
Whereas hundreds of Cubans who participated in the July 
protests continue to face unjust detention and other 
forms of retribution, including dozens who have been sen-
tenced in summary trials without due process and dozens 
of others who remain unaccounted for; 
Whereas United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights Michelle Bachelet expressed concern about ‘‘the 
excessive force against demonstrators in Cuba and the 
arrest of a large number of people, including journalists’’ 
and noted ‘‘it is particularly worrying that these include 
individuals allegedly held incommunicado and people 
whose whereabouts are unknown’’; 
Whereas, on July 25, 2021, Secretary of State Antony 
Blinken and the foreign ministers of 20 countries issued 
a statement to ‘‘condemn the mass arrests and detentions 
of protestors in Cuba and call on the government to re-
spect the universal rights and freedoms of the Cuban 
people, including the free flow of information to all Cu-
bans’’;

Whereas, on October 17, 2021, Assistant Secretary of State 
for Western Hemisphere Affairs Brian A. Nichols said 
‘‘Denying the right of peaceful assembly to Cubans this 
November 15th shows the Cuban regime’s disregard for 
the human rights and freedoms of its people. This and 
other blatant attempts to intimidate their citizens is a 
clear sign the regime won’t listen to what Cubans have 
to say.’’; 
Whereas over the summer, Cuba has seen record numbers of 
COVID–19 infections and deaths, pushing hospitals and 
health centers to near collapse; and 
Whereas basic medicines and common goods have become 
scarce throughout the country and economists estimate 
Cuba’s economic conditions will become even worse in the 
coming months: Now, therefore, be it
