Whereas Sikhism teaches peace, reconciliation, and over-
coming differences to build community; 
Whereas Sikhism is the world’s fifth largest religion, with 
more than 25,000,000 followers worldwide and about 
1,000,000 in the United States; 
Whereas Sikhs first arrived in the United States in 1899, 
and many early pioneers worked to build the Nation’s 
railroads and other pieces of critical infrastructure; 
Whereas, by 1910, many Sikh pioneers had begun agriculture 
enterprises and helped feed the people of the United 
States; 
Whereas the first Sikh gurdwara was established in Stockton, 
California, in 1912, and continues to operate in the 
present day; 
Whereas there are now more than 200 gurdwaras in the 
United States; 
Whereas Sikhs have fought courageously for and alongside 
the United States in every conflict since World War I; 
Whereas despite these undeniable contributions to American 
society, Sikhs have faced discrimination in the United 
States; 
Whereas World War I veteran Bhagat Singh Thind coura-
geously campaigned for the right of Sikhs and East Indi-
ans to become citizens, but was denied this right by the 
Supreme Court in the 1923 case United States v. Bhagat 
Singh Thind; 
Whereas legislation to authorize Sikhs and other East Indian 
immigrants to naturalize as United States citizens was 
not enacted until 1946;

Whereas, in 1957, Dalip Singh Saund became the first Sikh 
American, the first Indian American, and the first Asian 
American elected to the United States House of Rep-
resentatives; 
Whereas Sikh Americans today still face attacks on their 
identity and culture, including hate crimes that tragically 
claim lives, as in Elk Grove, California, in 2011 and Oak 
Creek, Wisconsin, in 2012; 
Whereas despite this troubling history, Sikh Americans today 
have overcome these challenges to become successful in 
all aspects of American life and openly celebrate their 
culture through events at gurdwaras, parades, and fes-
tivals; 
Whereas members of the Sikh community continue to make 
outstanding contributions to the economic vibrancy of the 
region in industries including agriculture, transportation, 
education, medicine, and retail; 
Whereas the Sikh community’s generous philanthropy has as-
sisted many and serves as a testimony of the commitment 
of Sikhs to the teachings of Guru Nanak and their love 
of country; 
Whereas Sikh elected officials increasingly and proudly rep-
resent their respective communities in public office; 
Whereas the patriotic efforts of Lieutenant Colonel Kamal 
Kalsi helped open the door to Sikhs serving their country 
in the Armed Forces while maintaining their religious 
traditions and culture; 
Whereas an increasing number of Sikh young people have 
been inspired by Lieutenant Colonel Kalsi’s example and 
have enlisted in the Armed Forces in recent years; and
