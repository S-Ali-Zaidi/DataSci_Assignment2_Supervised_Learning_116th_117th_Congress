SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Global Health Security 
2
Act of 2021’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) In December 2009, President Obama re-
6
leased the National Strategy for Countering Biologi-
7
cal Threats, which listed as one of seven objectives 
8
‘‘Promote global health security: Increase the avail-
9
ability of and access to knowledge and products of 
10
the life sciences that can help reduce the impact 
11
from outbreaks of infectious disease whether of nat-
12
ural, accidental, or deliberate origin’’. 
13
(2) In February 2014, the United States and 
14
nearly 30 other nations launched the Global Health 
15
Security Agenda (GHSA) to address several high- 
16
priority, global infectious disease threats. The 
17
GHSA is a multi-faceted, multi-country initiative in-
18
tended to accelerate partner countries’ measurable 
19
capabilities to achieve specific targets to prevent, de-
20
tect, and respond to infectious disease threats, 
21
whether naturally occurring, deliberate, or acci-
22
dental. 
23
(3) In 2015, the United Nations adopted the 
24
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which in-
25
clude specific reference to the importance of global 
26

•HR 391 IH
health security as part of SDG 3 ‘‘ensure healthy 
1
lives and promote well-being for all at all ages’’ as 
2
follows: ‘‘strengthen the capacity of all countries, in 
3
particular developing countries, for early warning, 
4
risk reduction and management of national and 
5
global health risks’’. 
6
(4) On November 4, 2016, President Obama 
7
signed Executive Order No. 13747, ‘‘Advancing the 
8
Global Health Security Agenda to Achieve a World 
9
Safe and Secure from Infectious Disease Threats’’. 
10
(5) In October 2017 at the GHSA Ministerial 
11
Meeting in Uganda, the United States and more 
12
than 40 GHSA member countries supported the 
13
‘‘Kampala Declaration’’ to extend the GHSA for an 
14
additional 5 years to 2024. 
15
(6) In December 2017, President Trump re-
16
leased the National Security Strategy, which in-
17
cludes the priority action: ‘‘Detect and contain bio-
18
threats at their source: We will work with other 
19
countries to detect and mitigate outbreaks early to 
20
prevent the spread of disease. We will encourage 
21
other countries to invest in basic health care systems 
22
and to strengthen global health security across the 
23
intersection of human and animal health to prevent 
24
infectious disease outbreaks’’.

(7) In September 2018, President Trump re-
1
leased the National Biodefense Strategy, which in-
2
cludes objectives to ‘‘strengthen global health secu-
3
rity capacities to prevent local bioincidents from be-
4
coming epidemics’’, and ‘‘strengthen international 
5
preparedness to support international response and

recovery capabilities’’.

SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.

It is the policy of the United States to— 
9
(1) promote global health security as a core na-
10
tional security interest; 
11
(2) advance the aims of the Global Health Se-
12
curity Agenda;
