RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
Congress should enact the Voters with Disabilities Bill 
of Rights to establish that voters with disabilities have 
equal access to the ballot as nondisabled persons. 
Whereas, according to the 2018 American Community Sur-
vey, 40,600,000 people with disabilities live in the United 
States, totaling approximately 13 percent of the non-
institutionalized United States population; 
Whereas researchers from the School of Management and 
Labor at Rutgers University found a continued gap in 
participation between voters with and without disabilities 
in the November 2020 elections;

Whereas a national survey sponsored by the Election Assist-
ance Commission found that 11 percent of voters with 
disabilities experienced difficulties with voting in the No-
vember 2020 elections, nearly twice the rate of voters 
without disabilities; 
Whereas, despite the size, diversity, and the interest of people 
with disabilities to participate in the United States elec-
toral system, elections in the United States are woefully, 
inexcusably, and unjustly not fully accessible to all voters; 
and 
Whereas, despite the demonstrated investment of the disabled 
community in elections, people with disabilities continue 
to turn out to vote at a lower rate than their nondisabled 
peers: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-
1
resentatives that Congress should enact the Voters with 
2
Disabilities Bill of Rights to establish that voters with dis-
3
abilities have equal access to the ballot as nondisabled per-
