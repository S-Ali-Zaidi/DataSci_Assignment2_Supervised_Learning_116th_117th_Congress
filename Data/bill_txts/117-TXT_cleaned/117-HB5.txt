A BILL 
To prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex, gender 
identity, and sexual orientation, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Equality Act’’.

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:

•HR 5 IH
(1) Discrimination can occur on the basis of the 
1
sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, pregnancy, 
2
childbirth, or a related medical condition of an indi-
3
vidual, as well as because of sex-based stereotypes. 
4
Each of these factors alone can serve as the basis 
5
for discrimination, and each is a form of sex dis-
6
crimination. 
7
(2) A single instance of discrimination may 
8
have more than one basis. For example, discrimina-
9
tion against a married same-sex couple could be 
10
based on the sex stereotype that marriage should 
11
only be between heterosexual couples, the sexual ori-
12
entation of the two individuals in the couple, or 
13
both. In addition, some persons are subjected to dis-
14
crimination based on a combination or the intersec-
15
tion of multiple protected characteristics. Discrimi-
16
nation against a pregnant lesbian could be based on 
17
her sex, her sexual orientation, her pregnancy, or on 
18
the basis of multiple factors. 
19
(3) Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and 
20
queer (referred to as ‘‘LGBTQ’’) people commonly 
21
experience discrimination in securing access to pub-
22
lic accommodations—including restaurants, senior 
23
centers, stores, places of or establishments that pro-
24
vide entertainment, health care facilities, shelters, 
25

government offices, youth service providers including 
1
adoption and foster care providers, and transpor-
2
tation. Forms of discrimination include the exclusion 
3
and denial of entry, unequal or unfair treatment, 
4
harassment, and violence. This discrimination pre-
5
vents the full participation of LGBTQ people in so-
6
ciety and disrupts the free flow of commerce. 
7
(4) Women also have faced discrimination in 
8
many establishments such as stores and restaurants, 
9
and places or establishments that provide other 
10
goods or services, such as entertainment or transpor-
11
tation, including sexual harassment, differential pric-
12
ing for substantially similar products and services, 
13
and denial of services because they are pregnant or 
14
breastfeeding. 
15
(5) Many employers already and continue to 
16
take proactive steps, beyond those required by some 
17
States and localities, to ensure they are fostering 
18
positive and respectful cultures for all employees. 
19
Many places of public accommodation also recognize 
20
the economic imperative to offer goods and services 
21
to as many consumers as possible. 
22
(6) Regular and ongoing discrimination against 
23
LGBTQ people, as well as women, in accessing pub-
24
lic accommodations contributes to negative social

and economic outcomes, and in the case of public ac-
1
commodations operated by State and local govern-
2
ments, abridges individuals’ constitutional rights. 
3
(7) The discredited practice known as ‘‘conver-
4
sion therapy’’ is a form of discrimination that harms 
5
LGBTQ people by undermining individuals’ sense of 
6
self worth, increasing suicide ideation and substance 
7
abuse, exacerbating family conflict, and contributing 
8
to second-class status. 
9
(8) Both LGBTQ people and women face wide-
10
spread discrimination in employment and various 
11
services, including by entities that receive Federal fi-
12
nancial assistance. Such discrimination— 
13
(A) is particularly troubling and inappro-
14
priate for programs and services funded wholly 
15
or in part by the Federal Government; 
16
(B) undermines national progress toward 
17
equal treatment regardless of sex, sexual ori-
18
entation, or gender identity; and 
19
(C) is inconsistent with the constitutional 
20
principle of equal protection under the Four-
21
teenth Amendment to the Constitution of the 
22
United States. 
23
(9) Federal courts have widely recognized that, 
24
in enacting the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Congress 
25
00:50 Feb 19, 2021

•HR 5 IH
validly invoked its powers under the Fourteenth 
1
Amendment to provide a full range of remedies in 
2
response to persistent, widespread, and pervasive 
3
discrimination by both private and government ac-
4
tors. 
5
(10) Discrimination by State and local govern-
6
ments on the basis of sexual orientation or gender 
7
identity in employment, housing, and public accom-
8
modations, and in programs and activities receiving 
9
Federal financial assistance, violates the Equal Pro-
10
tection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the 
11
Constitution of the United States. In many cir-
12
cumstances, such discrimination also violates other 
13
constitutional rights such as those of liberty and pri-
14
vacy under the due process clause of the Fourteenth 
15
Amendment. 
16
(11) Individuals who are LGBTQ, or are per-
17
ceived to be LGBTQ, have been subjected to a his-
18
tory and pattern of persistent, widespread, and per-
19
vasive discrimination on the bases of sexual orienta-
20
tion and gender identity by both private sector and 
21
Federal, State, and local government actors, includ-
22
ing in employment, housing, and public accommoda-
23
tions, and in programs and activities receiving Fed-
24
eral financial assistance. This discrimination inflicts 
25
00:50 Feb 19, 2021
H5
7 
•HR 5 IH
a range of tangible and intangible harms, sometimes 
1
even including serious physical injury or death. An 
2
explicit and comprehensive national solution is need-
3
ed to address this discrimination, including the full 
4
range of remedies available under the Civil Rights 
5
Act of 1964. 
6
(12) Discrimination based on sexual orientation 
7
includes discrimination based on an individual’s ac-
8
tual or perceived romantic, emotional, physical, or 
9
sexual attraction to other persons, or lack thereof, 
10
on the basis of gender. LGBTQ people, including 
11
gender nonbinary people, also commonly experience 
12
discrimination because of sex-based stereotypes. 
13
Many people are subjected to discrimination because 
14
of others’ perceptions or beliefs regarding their sex-
15
ual orientation. Even if these perceptions are incor-
16
rect, the identity imputed by others forms the basis 
17
of discrimination. 
18
(13) Numerous provisions of Federal law ex-
19
pressly prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex, 
20
and Federal courts and agencies have correctly in-
21
terpreted these prohibitions on sex discrimination to 
22
include discrimination based on sexual orientation, 
23
gender identity, and sex stereotypes. In particular, 
24
the Supreme Court of the United States correctly 
25
00:50 Feb 19, 2021
H5
8 
•HR 5 IH
held in Bostock v. Clayton County, 140 S. Ct. 1731 
1
(2020) that the prohibition on employment discrimi-
2
nation because of sex under title VII of the Civil 
3
Rights Act of 1964 inherently includes discrimina-
4
tion because of sexual orientation or transgender 
5
status. 
6
(14) This Act makes explicit that existing Fed-
7
eral statutes prohibiting sex discrimination in em-
8
ployment 
(including 
in 
access 
to 
benefits), 
9
healthcare, housing, education, credit, and jury serv-
10
ice also prohibit sexual orientation and gender iden-
11
tity discrimination. 
12
(15) LGBTQ people often face discrimination 
13
when seeking to rent or purchase housing, as well as 
14
in every other aspect of obtaining and maintaining 
15
housing. LGBTQ people in same-sex relationships 
16
are often discriminated against when two names as-
17
sociated with one gender appear on a housing appli-
18
cation, and transgender people often encounter dis-
19
crimination when credit checks or inquiries reveal a 
20
former name. 
21
(16) National surveys, including a study com-
22
missioned by the Department of Housing and Urban 
23
Development, show that housing discrimination 
24
against LGBTQ people is very prevalent. For in-
25
00:50 Feb 19, 2021
H5
9 
•HR 5 IH
stance, when same-sex couples inquire about housing 
1
that is available for rent, they are less likely to re-
2
ceive positive responses from landlords. A national 
3
matched-pair testing investigation found that nearly 
4
one-half of same-sex couples had encountered ad-
5
verse, differential treatment when seeking elder 
6
housing. According to other studies, transgender 
7
people have half the homeownership rate of non- 
8
transgender people and about 1 in 5 transgender 
9
people experience homelessness. Another survey 
10
found that 82 percent of gender nonbinary people 
11
experiencing homelessness lacked access to shelter. 
12
(17) As a result of the absence of explicit prohi-
13
bitions against discrimination on the basis of sexual 
14
orientation and gender identity, credit applicants 
15
who are LGBTQ, or are perceived to be LGBTQ, 
16
have unequal opportunities to establish credit. 
17
LGBTQ people can experience being denied a mort-
18
gage, credit card, student loan, or many other types 
19
of credit simply because of their sexual orientation 
20
or gender identity. 
21
(18) 
Numerous 
studies 
demonstrate 
that 
22
LGBTQ people, especially transgender people and 
23
women, are economically disadvantaged and at a 
24
higher risk for poverty compared with other groups 
25
00:50 Feb 19, 2021
H5
10 
•HR 5 IH
of people. For example, the poverty rate for older 
1
women in same-sex couples is twice that of older dif-
2
ferent-sex couples. 
3
(19) The right to an impartial jury of one’s 
4
peers and the reciprocal right to jury service are 
5
fundamental to the free and democratic system of 
6
justice in the United States and are based in the 
7
Bill of Rights. There is, however, an unfortunate 
8
and long-documented history in the United States of 
9
attorneys discriminating against LGBTQ individ-
10
uals, or those perceived to be LGBTQ, in jury selec-
11
tion. Failure to bar peremptory challenges based on 
12
the actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender 
13
identity of an individual not only erodes a funda-
14
mental right, duty, and obligation of being a citizen 
15
of the United States, but also unfairly creates a sec-
16
ond class of citizenship for LGBTQ victims, wit-
17
nesses, plaintiffs, and defendants. 
18
(20) Numerous studies document the shortage 
19
of qualified and available homes for the approxi-
20
mately 424,000 youth in the child welfare system 
21
and the negative outcomes for the many youth who 
22
live in group care as opposed to a loving home or 
23
who age out of care without a permanent family 
24
placement. Although same-sex couples are 7 times 
25
00:50 Feb 19, 2021
H5
11 
•HR 5 IH
more likely to foster or adopt than their different- 
1
sex counterparts, many child-placing agencies refuse 
2
to serve same-sex couples and LGBTQ individuals. 
3
This has resulted in a reduction of the pool of quali-
4
fied and available homes for youth in the child wel-
5
fare system who need placement on a temporary or 
6
permanent basis. It also sends a negative message 
7
about LGBTQ people to children and youth in the 
8
child welfare system about who is, and who is not, 
9
considered fit to be a parent. While the priority 
10
should be on providing the supports necessary to 
11
keep children with their families, when removal is re-
12
quired, barring discrimination in foster care and 
13
adoption will increase the number of homes available 
14
to foster children waiting for foster and adoptive 
15
families. 
16
(21) LGBTQ youth are overrepresented in the 
17
foster care system by at least a factor of two and 
18
report twice the rate of poor treatment while in care 
19
compared 
to 
their 
non-LGBTQ 
counterparts. 
20
LGBTQ youth in foster care have a higher average 
21
number of placements, higher likelihood of living in 
22
a group home, and higher rates of hospitalization for 
23
emotional reasons and of juvenile justice involvement 
24
than their non-LGBTQ peers because of the high 
25
00:50 Feb 19, 2021
H5
12 
•HR 5 IH
level of bias and discrimination that they face and 
1
the difficulty of finding affirming foster placements. 
2
Further, due to their physical distance from friends 
3
and family, traumatic experiences, and potentially 
4
unstable living situations, all youth involved with 
5
child welfare services are at risk for being targeted 
6
by traffickers seeking to exploit children. Barring 
7
discrimination in child welfare services will ensure 
8
improved treatment and outcomes for LGBTQ foster 
9
children. 
10
(22) Courts consistently have found that the 
11
government has a compelling interest in preventing 
12
and remedying discrimination. For example, the Su-
13
preme Court of the United States found there to be 
14
a compelling government interest in eliminating sex 
15
discrimination in Board of Directors of Rotary 
16
International v. Rotary Club of Duarte, 481 U.S. 
17
537, 549 (1987). Because discrimination based on 
18
sexual orientation or gender identity inherently is a 
19
form of sex discrimination, as held in Bostock v. 
20
Clayton County, 140 S. Ct. 1731 (2020), this Act 
21
furthers the compelling government interest in pro-
22
viding redress for the serious harms to mental and 
23
physical health, financial security and wellbeing, 
24
civic participation, freedom of movement and oppor-
25
00:50 Feb 19, 2021

•HR 5 IH
tunity, personal dignity, and physical safety that re-
1
sult from discrimination. Consistent with the role 
2
nondiscrimination laws play in protecting lives and 
3
livelihoods, alleviating suffering, and improving indi-
4
vidual and public health, the Supreme Court of the 
5
United States has long recognized, under the deci-
6
sion in Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United 
7
States, 379 U.S. 241 (1964), that these laws also 
8
benefit society as a whole by ending the ‘‘disruptive 
9
effect’’ discrimination has on travel and commerce, 
10
and by creating a level field for all participants in 
11
a given sector. 
12
(23) As with all prohibitions on invidious dis-
13
crimination, this Act furthers the government’s com-
14
pelling interest in the least restrictive way because 
15
only by forbidding discrimination is it possible to 
16
avert or redress the harms described in this sub-
17
section. 
18
(b) PURPOSE.—It is the purpose of this Act to ex-
19
pand as well as clarify, confirm and create greater consist-
20
ency in the protections and remedies against discrimina-
21
tion on the basis of all covered characteristics and to pro-
22
vide guidance and notice to individuals, organizations, cor-
23
