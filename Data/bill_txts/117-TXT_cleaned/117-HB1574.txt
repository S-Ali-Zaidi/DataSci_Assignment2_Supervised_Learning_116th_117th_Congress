Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Berta Ca´ceres Human 
4
Rights in Honduras Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) The Honduran military and police are wide-
8
ly established to be deeply corrupt and commit 
9
human rights abuses, including torture, rape, illegal 
10
detention, and murder, with impunity. 
11
(2) The New York Times revealed documents 
12
on April 15, 2016, indicating that top officials of the 
13
Honduran police ordered the killings of drug-crime 
14
investigators Julia´n Arı´stides Gonza´les and Alfredo 
15
Landaverde in 2009 and 2011, respectively, with the 
16
subsequent knowledge of top police and, evidently, 
17
high-ranking government officials. The Times sug-
18
gested in a subsequent article that the revelations 
19
were being manipulated by the President of Hon-
20
duras for his own corrupt purposes. Both cases re-
21
main in impunity. 
22
(3) Individuals in the military and police with 
23
documented records of having committed gross 
24
human rights abuses with impunity continue to serve

in, and be appointed and reappointed to high posi-
1
tions with state security forces. Former Army gen-
2
eral in the Armed Forces Julian Pacheco Tinoco, the 
3
Minister of Security, was the highest ranking official 
4
in charge of the repression of protesters by the po-
5
lice following the November 27, 2017, election, and 
6
has been twice named in United States Federal 
7
court as overseeing drug trafficking. He was re-
8
appointed to his position by President Juan Orlando 
9
Herna´ndez in December 2018. 
10
(4) Other individuals who previously served in 
11
high-ranking positions and who are documented to 
12
have committed gross human rights abuses continue 
13
in impunity. In January 2021, United States Fed-
14
eral prosecutors filed new motions with the Depart-
15
ment of Justice in the Southern District of New 
16
York that implicate senior military, police, political, 
17
and business figures in laundering money, bribery, 
18
and murder, including former head of National Po-
19
lice, Juan Carlos ‘‘El Tigre’’ Bonilla Valladares. 
20
(5) International human rights bodies have re-
21
ported that the Honduran military and police com-
22
mit human rights abuses, including killings, with im-
23
punity. The Associated Press has documented death 
24
squad activity by police. Human Rights Watch has 
25
23:47 Apr 17, 2021
H1574

•HR 1574 IH
reported: ‘‘The use of lethal force by the national po-
1
lice is a chronic problem.’’. The United Nations 
2
Working Group on Business and Human Rights 
3
stated in 2019 that ‘‘numerous evictions, seeking to 
4
allow business to operate, have been conducted with 
5
the excessive use of force by police and military . . . 
6
resulting in the loss of life and grave injury to peo-
7
ple’’. 
8
(6) The Department of State’s 2019 Human 
9
Rights Report for Honduras reported: ‘‘Civilian au-
10
thorities at times did not maintain effective control 
11
over the security forces.’’. It summarized: ‘‘Signifi-
12
cant human rights issues included: unlawful or arbi-
13
trary killings, including extrajudicial killings; tor-
14
ture; harsh and life-threatening prison conditions; 
15
arbitrary arrest or detention.’’. In 2020, Human 
16
Rights Watch reported that ‘‘Security forces com-
17
mitted abuses while enforcing a nationwide COVID– 
18
19 
lockdown 
that 
President 
Juan 
Orlando 
19
Herna´ndez imposed in March.’’. 
20
(7) Repeated efforts to clean up the Honduran 
21
police have largely failed. A recent commission 
22
charged with cleaning up the police reports that it 
23
has cleaned up over 5,000 members, but the great 
24
majority of those were separated for reasons of re-
25

structuring, retirements, or disabilities. Only ap-
1
proximately 100 cases of alleged criminal activity 
2
have been forwarded to the Public Ministry for pros-
3
ecution. Few of those are being prosecuted. The ac-
4
tions and results of the police cleanup commission 
5
have not been independently verified, moreover, and 
6
its directors include Julian Pacheco Tinoco, the Min-
7
ister of Security, named as a drug trafficker, and 
8
Vilma Morales, one of the top two negotiators for 
9
the leader of the 2009 coup. Long-lasting, funda-
10
mental reform of the police still needs to be enacted. 
11
UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
12
rights defenders determined that, ‘‘progress (on po-
13
lice clean up) is diminished by the involvement of 
14
the armed forces in carrying out police functions and 
15
maintaining public order since 2011’’. In its report 
16
for 2020, Human Rights Watch concludes: ‘‘Efforts 
17
to reform public-security institutions have stalled. 
18
Marred by corruption and abuse, the judiciary and 
19
police remain largely ineffective. Impunity for 
20
human rights abuses, violent crime, and corruption 
21
remains the norm’’. 
22
(8) Evidence indicates that topmost officials in 
23
charge of the police have been allegedly involved in 
24
drug trafficking. The National Director of the Police 
25
23:47 Apr 17, 2021
H1574

•HR 1574 IH
and his top two lieutenants have been documented 
1
by the Associated Press to have previously partici-
2
pated in cocaine trafficking. Julian Pacheco Tinoco, 
3
the Minister of Security, reappointed in December 
4
2018, has been twice named in United States Fed-
5
eral court as overseeing drug trafficking. United 
6
States Federal prosecutors have released documents 
7
implicating Honduran President Juan Orlando 
8
Herna´ndez in a drug trafficking and money laun-
9
dering conspiracy with his brother Juan Antonio 
10
Herna´ndez. In October 2019, Tony Herna´ndez was 
11
convicted of drug conspiracy in United States Fed-
12
eral Court. 
13
(9) Human rights organizations have docu-
14
mented that the Fifteenth Battalion of the Hon-
15
duran Armed Forces allegedly participated with po-
16
lice and private security forces in some of the 
17
killings of over 100 small-farmer, agrarian reform 
18
activists in the Agua´n Valley beginning in 2010. In 
19
2015, Human Rights Watch confirmed that the 
20
killings of Agua´n farmers were met with no con-
21
sequences. To date there has been one confirmed 
22
conviction of a private security guard. Assassinations 
23
of key activists continue. In October 2016, Jose´ 
24
Angel 
Flores, 
the 
president 
of 
the 
Unified

•HR 1574 IH
Campesino Movement of the Agua´n (MUCA), and 
1
Silmer Dionisio George, another MUCA member, 
2
were assassinated, with impunity. Local human 
3
rights organizations report a chronic problem with 
4
witness intimidation coupled with reports that the 
5
identity of witnesses is leaked by police investigators. 
6
Violence, threats, and criminalization of agrarian re-
7
form advocates in the region continues. 
8
(10) Further examples abound of human rights 
9
abuses by the military: in July 2013 members of the 
10
Armed Forces shot and killed Toma´s Garcı´a, a 
11
Lenca Indigenous activist, and injured his son while 
12
they were peacefully protesting a dam project; in 
13
May 2014, nine members of the Ninth Infantry re-
14
portedly tortured and killed Amado Maradiaga 
15
Quiroz and tortured his son, Milton Noe Maradiaga 
16
Varela. The case remains in impunity. In an em-
17
blematic case, on December 27, 2015, the Honduran 
18
Navy reportedly killed Joel Palacios Lino and Elvis 
19
Armando Garcı´a, two Garı´funa Afro-Indigenous men 
20
who were engaged in digging a car out of the sand 
21
on a beach. Ten members of the Honduran military 
22
were convicted of the killing of these 2 men, under-
23
scoring that egregious human rights are committed 
24
by state security forces. On June 20, 2019, Eblin

•HR 1574 IH
Noe Corea, a 17-year-old student leader was killed 
1
by the military while participating in a protest with 
2
the Platform in Defense of Health and Education. 
3
On April 24, 2020, state security forces beat three 
4
brothers in Omoa, Cortes, shooting two of them and 
5
killing one after they were arbitrarily detained for 
6
selling bread. A member of the Army assigned to the 
7
Maya Chorti Task Force, is accused of the killing. 
8
(11) The current Government of Honduras has 
9
expanded the military’s reach into domestic policing, 
10
including the creation of a 4,300-member Military 
11
Police in clear violation of the Honduran constitu-
12
tion and with disastrous results, including the 
13
killings of a 15-year-old boy, Ebed Yanes, in 2012 
14
and a student, Erlin Misael Carı´as Moncada, in 
15
2014, after they had passed unarmed through check-
16
points, and the January 2, 2017, killing of 17-year- 
17
old Edgardo Moreno Rodriquez. While one member 
18
of the armed forces was convicted and sentenced in 
19
the case of Yanes, the case of the United States- 
20
trained colonel who allegedly subsequently ordered a 
21
cover-up remains in impunity. Since the creation of 
22
the Military Police, ‘‘allegations of human rights 
23
abuses by the military have increased notably’’, re-
24
ports Human Rights Watch. The Military Police

now count 9 battalions and plan 2 additional battal-
1
ions. 
2
(12) During the crisis that erupted following 
3
the highly contested November 2017 Presidential 
4
election, massive protests against electoral fraud and 
5
the constitutionality of disputed re-election campaign 
6
of President Juan Orlando Herna´ndez emerged 
7
throughout the country. The United Nations and the 
8
Committee of Families of the Detained and Dis-
9
appeared in Honduras (COFADEH) have docu-
10
mented that in response, Honduran state security 
11
forces killed at least 23 people, many of them pro-
12
testers and bystanders; one additional person re-
13
mains forcibly disappeared by state security forces. 
14
The great majority of the victims, according to the 
15
UN and COFADEH reports, were killed by the Mili-
16
tary Police. All these cases remain in impunity. In 
17
addition, 3 people accused of crimes while protesting 
18
were imprisoned for 2 years while awaiting trial 
19
under dire, life-threatening conditions; 3 years later 
20
they continue to be subjected to criminal proceedings 
21
characterized by procedural delays and obstruction 
22
of fundamental rights including the right to work. A 
23
fourth remains in exile.

(13) The Military Police continue to commit se-
1
rious human rights abuses. On November 30, 2017, 
2
Daniel Isaac Varela, age 12, was wounded by mem-
3
bers of the military police in Comayagu¨ela during a 
4
post-election demonstration while he was purchasing 
5
candy with friends and the military opened fire. On 
6
December 3, 2017, Manuel de Jesu´s Bautista Sal-
7
vador disappeared while held in detention by the 
8
Military Police in Cofradı´a, Corte´s, and his where-
9
abouts remain unknown. In response to the COVID– 
10
19 pandemic, the Government of Honduras declared 
11
a state of emergency in March 2020 authorizing a 
12
militarized lockdown and suspension of constitu-
13
tional guarantees resulting in an ‘‘alarming in-
14
crease’’ in human rights violations by state security 
15
forces, including attacks on human rights defenders, 
16
journalists, 
and 
citizens 
protesting 
for 
food. 
17
COFADEH reports that with militarization of the 
18
country, there has been a reactivation of death 
19
squads resulting in 17 forced disappearances in 
20
2020. 
21
(14) The Honduran judicial system has been 
22
widely documented to be rife with corruption. 
23
Judges, prosecutors, and other officials are inter-
24
23:47 Apr 17, 2021
H1574
11 
•HR 1574 IH
connected with organized crime and drug traffickers, 
1
contributing to near-complete impunity. 
2
(15) The Department of State in its 2019 
3
Human Rights Report for Honduras reports that 
4
‘‘there were several reports that the government or 
5
its agents committed arbitrary or unlawful killings’’. 
6
It noted that ‘‘Impunity remained a serious problem, 
7
with significant delays in some prosecutions and 
8
sources alleging corruption in judicial proceedings.’’. 
9
(16) Overall, the judicial system remains inef-
10
fective and corrupt. The IACHR report for 2019 
11
states, ‘‘The lack of access to justice has created a 
12
situation of structural impunity that has the effect 
13
of perpetuating and, in certain cases, favoring the 
14
repetition of serious human rights violations.’’. 
15
(17) Summarizing the situation, Human Rights 
16
Watch reported for 2019 that ‘‘Judges face inter-
17
ference from the executive branch and others, in-
18
cluding private actors with connections in govern-
19
ment.’’. It concludes: ‘‘Efforts to reform public-secu-
20
rity institutions have stalled. Marred by corruption 
21
and abuse, the judiciary and police remain largely 
22
ineffective. Impunity for crimes and human rights 
23
abuses is the norm.’’.

(18) The March 2, 2016, assassination of 
1
prominent Lenca Indigenous and environmental ac-
2
tivist Berta Ca´ceres, world-renowned recipient of the 
3
2015 Goldman Environmental Prize for her work 
4
defending Indigenous land rights against a hydro-
5
electric dam project, illustrates the human rights cri-
6
sis in Honduras, and the deep complicity of the 
7
Honduran government. Ca´ceres, the leader of 
8
COPINH, the Council of Indigenous and Popular 
9
Organizations of Honduras, had reported to authori-
10
ties 33 threats previous to her killing, but none had 
11
been investigated, and the government had failed to 
12
provide adequate protection measures as mandated 
13
by the Inter-American Commission on Human 
14
Rights, with protection by Honduran security being 
15
withdrawn the day of her death. 
16
(19) In December 2019, seven men were con-
17
victed in the killing of Ca´ceres. One of them was an 
18
active duty officer in the military at the time of his 
19
arrest and two others are former military. Prosecu-
20
tion of the intellectual authors is still pending. Evi-
21
dence made public in the trial indicates the partici-
22
pation of several executives and directors of DESA 
23
Corporation, the dam construction company, in the 
24
murder scheme. However, only the president of 
25
23:47 Apr 17, 2021
H1574
13 
•HR 1574 IH
DESA, a former military officer has been charged. 
1
Though charged in March 2018, his trial has yet to 
2
begin due to unreasonable delays initiated by defense 
3
lawyers and permitted by the judiciary. The convic-
4
tions raise serious questions about the role of the 
5
Honduran military in her assassination, including 
6
higher ranks in the chain of command within the 
7
military as well as the identity of the intellectual au-
8
thors of the assassination. Evidence in the docu-
9
ments in the case file indicate that members of the 
10
Honduran elite were responsible for ordering 
11
Ca´ceres’s assassination, and remain in impunity. 
12
Evidence also indicates possible involvement of indi-
13
viduals of higher rank in the military, but there is 
14
no indication that prosecutors are investigating these 
15
individuals. 
16
(20) The Government of Honduras continues to 
17
unduly limit legally mandated access by Ms. 
18
Ca´ceres’s family to participation in the prosecution 
19
as permitted under Honduran law. 
20
(21) In this context of corruption and human 
21
rights abuses, trade unionists, journalists, lawyers, 
22
Afro-Indigenous 
activists, 
Indigenous 
activists, 
23
small-farmer activists, LGBTI activists, human 
24
rights defenders, environmental defenders, and crit-

•HR 1574 IH
ics of the government remain at severe risk; and pre-
1
vious human rights abuses against them remain 
2
largely unpunished. 
3
(22) Journalists continue to be attacked with 
4
impunity. On May 2, 2016, prominent opposition 
5
journalist Fe´lix Molina was shot multiple times in 
6
the legs hours after he had posted information po-
7
tentially linking Ca´ceres’s killing to a top govern-
8
ment official, members of an elite family, and one of 
9
the prosecutors in the case. Those who report on 
10
protests against the government are threatened and 
11
attacked by state security forces. On November 26, 
12
2018, journalist Geovanny Sierra from the UNETV 
13
opposition television station was in the process of re-
14
porting on the repression by security forces of a pro-
15
test marking the one-year anniversary of the dis-
16
puted 2017 elections when he was fired upon by 
17
members of the police assigned to the National Peni-
18
tentiary. He survived the attack but suffered exten-
19
sive injuries to his right arm. Both cases remain in 
20
impunity. Four journalists were killed in 2020. 
21
(23) United States agencies allocated approxi-
22
mately $39 million that Congress appropriated 
23
through the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017,
