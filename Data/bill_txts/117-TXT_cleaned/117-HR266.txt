success, making good on the administration’s promise in 
2020 to ‘‘. . . deliver by the end of this year a vaccine 
at scale to treat the American people’’; 
Whereas Operation Warp Speed’s rate of vaccine development 
was particularly astonishing, having completely shattered 
expectations about the development timeline by delivering 
two candidates described as ‘‘gold standard vaccines’’ in 
only 9 months, rather than years; 
Whereas the Trump administration supported the scientists 
at Moderna, Inc., Pfizer, Inc., and Johnson & Johnson 
through the Biomedical Advanced Research and Develop-
ment Authority;

Advanced Research Projects Agency in conjunction with 
the Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Bio-
logical, Radiological and Nuclear Defense, partnered with 
the Department of Health and Human Services to opti-
mally deliver and administer a COVID–19 vaccine;

Management and Business Analytics at Johns Hopkins 
University, said, ‘‘Without Operation Warp Speed, there 
would be no Moderna vaccine’’; 
Whereas the Director of the National Institutes of Health, 
Dr. Francis Collins, praised the Trump administration 
for the unprecedented success of Operation Warp Speed 
and the multiple effective vaccines developed within 1

Whereas, by October 16, 2020, the Trump administration

Executive order ensuring the most vulnerable populations 
and Americans have priority access to the vaccine;

tered, setting the United States on pace to meet the 
Biden administration’s goal of 150,000,000 vaccines in 
his first 100 days; 
Whereas President Trump and Operation Warp Speed placed 
special emphasis on national security during a global 
health crisis, ensuring our vaccines were developed in the 
United States and met the strict standards of safety of 
United States vaccine development and deployment; and
