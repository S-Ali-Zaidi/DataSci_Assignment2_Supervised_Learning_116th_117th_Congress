Urging that the International Olympic Committee rebid the 
2022 Olympic Winter Games, and expressing the sense 
of Congress that the United States Olympic & 
Paralympic Committee should not participate if the 
Games are held in the People’s Republic of China and 
that the United States Government should lead an inter-
national boycott if the Games are held in the People’s 
Republic of China, and for other purposes. 
Whereas, in 2015, the International Olympic Committee an-
nounced Beijing, the capital city of the People’s Republic

of China, as the host city of the 2022 Olympic Winter 
Games; 
Whereas the Olympic charter states the goal of Olympism is 
to promote ‘‘a peaceful society concerned with the preser-
vation of human dignity’’; 
Whereas, according to the September 2020 House of Rep-
resentatives China Task Force Report, the Government 
of China is the leading human rights abuser in the world, 
depriving 1,400,000,000 human beings of their funda-
mental rights; 
Whereas, since 2017, the Government of China has detained 
and persecuted up to 1,800,000 Turkic Muslims, includ-
ing ethnic Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and Kyrgyz, in ‘‘political 
re-education’’ centers, and many detainees who have not 
‘‘graduated’’ from the facilities have been convicted of 
formal crimes and sentenced to prison terms; 
Whereas detained and imprisoned Muslim minorities in the 
Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) are held 
arbitrarily and without due process, coerced to disavow 
religious beliefs and cultural practices, forced to work in 
factories, deprived of food and other essential needs, and 
subjected to physical abuse, including torture and alleged 
organ harvesting; 
Whereas the Government of China is implementing a policy 
of employing large numbers of Uyghurs, including former 
detainees, in labor-intensive factories in Xinjiang and 
elsewhere in China under forced labor conditions; 
Whereas the Government of China has implemented policies 
against minority groups in the XUAR to lower birth 
rates, including forced abortions, sterilizations, and con-
traception;

Whereas according to the Australian Strategic Policy Insti-
tute, an estimated 8,500 mosques have been demolished 
in the XUAR, and nearly 30 percent of Islamic shrines, 
cemeteries, and other sites of religious importance in the 
region have been damaged or destroyed, mostly since 
2017; 
Whereas the annual report of the Congressional-Executive 
Commission on China for 2020 indicates— 
(1) the Government of China and the Chinese Com-
munist Party (CCP) have taken unprecedented steps in 
the last year to extend their repressive policies through 
censorship, intimidation, and the detention of individuals 
and groups for exercising their fundamental human 
rights, especially in the XUAR and Hong Kong; 
(2) in XUAR, it is now estimated that up to 1.8 mil-
lion Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Hui, and others have 
been arbitrarily detained in a system of extrajudicial 
mass internment camps where they are subjected to 
forced labor, torture, and political indoctrination; 
(3) forced labor in the XUAR is widespread and sys-
tematic and exists within the mass internment camps and 
elsewhere throughout the region, as part of a targeted 
campaign of repression against Turkic and Muslim mi-
norities; 
(4) detention of Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Hui, 
and others in mass internment camps in the XUAR since 
around April 2017, and authorities have also increasingly 
sentenced ethnic minority individuals to lengthy prison 
terms for political reasons since 2017; 
(5) in Hong Kong, the ‘‘one country, two systems’’ 
framework has been dismantled, severely undermining 
the rule of law and respect for human rights that the ter-
ritory has long enjoyed, and authorities arrested pro-

democracy leaders, prevented journalists from reporting, 
applied political pressure on the judiciary, and allowed 
the Hong Kong Police Force to grow increasingly abusive 
toward nonviolent protesters; and 
(6) the Government of China and CCP have further 
intensified campaigns that aim to bring religion in China 
under closer official control, and authorities have ex-
panded campaigns to target, control, and surveil not only 
religions deemed ‘‘foreign’’ like Christianity, Islam, and 
Tibetan Buddhism, but also traditional Chinese religions; 
Whereas Article 2 of the 1948 United Nations Convention on 
the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Geno-
cide, which both the United States and China have rati-
fied, defines genocide as ‘‘any of the following acts com-
mitted with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a na-
tional, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such: (a) kill-
ing members of the group; (b) causing serious bodily or 
mental harm to members of the group; (c) deliberately in-
flicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring 
about its physical destruction in whole or in part; (d) im-
posing measures intended to prevent births within the 
group; [or] (e) forcibly transferring children of the group 
to another group.’’; 
Whereas, on January 19, 2021, the Department of State de-
termined that the Government of China, under the direc-
tion and control of the CCP, ‘‘has committed genocide 
against the predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and other 
ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang’’, and on 
the same day, Secretary of State Antony Blinken agreed, 
stating, ‘‘forcing men, women and children into con-
centration camps, trying to in effect re-educate them to

be adherents to the Chinese Communist Party—all of 
that speaks to an effort to commit genocide’’; 
Whereas, in June 2020, the legislature of China passed a na-
tional security law for Hong Kong restricting basic polit-
ical rights and authorizing severe punishments for anyone 
inside or outside Hong Kong found guilty of broad vague-
ly defined crimes, effectively ending the longstanding 
‘‘one country, two systems’’ policy; 
Whereas, in September 2020, the House Foreign Affairs 
Committee Minority Staff Report on the origins of the 
COVID–19 global pandemic found that— 
(1) authorities in China harassed, detained, and dis-
appeared individuals who told the truth about the CCP’s 
handling of the COVID–19 pandemic; 
(2) during the early outbreak of the COVID–19 pan-
demic, the Government of China failed to meet an inter-
national legal requirement to inform the World Health 
Organization of the COVID–19 outbreak in Wuhan, 
Hubei Province, China; 
(3) during the early stages of the COVID–19 pan-
demic, the Government of China knew of the deadly 
human-to-human transmission capabilities of the virus 
and took steps to hide it from the public and global com-
munity; and 
(4) in February 2020, the Government of China na-
tionalized their medical supply chain to stockpile personal 
protective equipment and stop foreign exports to other 
countries battling the COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas the Department of State’s 2020 Trafficking in Per-
sons Report (TIP) relating to the People’s Republic of 
China—

(1) indicates that the Trafficking in Victims Protec-
tion Act defines ‘‘severe forms’’ of trafficking in persons 
as: sex trafficking in which a commercial sex act is in-
duced by force, fraud, or coercion, or in which the person 
induced to perform such an act has not attained 18 years 
of age; or the recruitment, harboring, transportation, 
provision, or obtaining of a person for labor or services, 
through the use of force, fraud, or coercion for the pur-
pose of subjection to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt 
bondage, or slavery; 
(2) states that Tier 3 is the most severe category for 
trafficking activity and defines Tier 3 as ‘‘countries 
whose governments do not fully comply with the min-
imum standards and are not making significant efforts to 
do so’’; and 
(3) indicates that the Government of China has been 
designated in Tier 3 by the Department of State in the 
TIP since 2017; 
Whereas, on February 3, 2021, the British Broadcasting 
Corporation (BBC) reported several shocking and appall-
ing firsthand accounts of an organized system of mass 
rape, sexual abuse, and torture of the Uyghurs in the 
XUAR; 
Whereas, on February 11, 2021, the PRC banned the BBC 
for its reporting on human rights abuses in XUAR; 
Whereas, in October 2020, United Kingdom Foreign Sec-
retary Dominic Raab stated, regarding a potential boy-
cott of the 2022 Winter Olympics due to human rights 
violations against the Uyghurs, that ‘‘my instinct is to 
separate sport from diplomacy and politics, but there 
comes a point where that may not be possible’’;

human rights organizations wrote to the International 
Olympic Committee requesting the committee ‘‘reverse its 
mistake in awarding Beijing the honor of hosting the 
Winter Olympic Games in 2022’’; 
Whereas, in November 2020, the Australian Parliament de-
bated a motion calling on the ‘‘Australian Government to 
work with the Australian Olympic Committee to ensure 
Australia boycotts the 2022 Winter Olympics games in 
Beijing’’; 
Whereas, in January 2020, the editorial board of The Wash-
ington Post opposed the Government of China hosting 
the 2022 Winter Olympics and stated, ‘‘the world must 
ask whether China, slowly strangling an entire people, 
has the moral standing to host the 2022 Winter Olympic 
Games. We think not.’’; 
Whereas, in 1980, in H. Con. Res. 249, the House of Rep-
resentatives voted 386 to 12, and the Senate voted 88 to 
4, to urge the United States Olympic Committee to pro-
pose the transfer or cancellation of the 1980 Summer 
Olympics in Moscow; to urge the International Olympic 
Committee to adopt such a proposal; and, if the Inter-
national Olympic Committee rejected the proposal, to 
urge the United States Olympic Committee and those of 
other countries not to participate in the Games and to 
conduct alternative games of their own, due to concerns 
over the Soviet Union’s invasion of Afghanistan; 
Whereas since the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing,

ence of China have severely worsened and do not meet

Whereas the Olympic Games is a celebration of international 
culture, a festival of humanity, and is intended to be 
independent of political, ideological, and diplomatic dis-
agreements, but hosting the 2022 Winter Olympics 
Games in the PRC, where organized atrocities in the 
XUAR are ongoing, where the freedoms of Hong Kong’s 
citizens are being trampled, where the fundamental right 
to worship is brutally persecuted, and in the wake of the 
ongoing global devastation from COVID–19, would be 
immoral, unethical, and wrong: Now, therefore, be it
