SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
1
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The assured supply of critical minerals and 
3
the resiliency of critical mineral supply chains are 
4
essential to the economic prosperity and national de-
5
fense of the United States. 
6
(2) The United States is heavily dependent on 
7
foreign sources of critical minerals and on foreign 
8
supply chains resulting in the potential for strategic 
9
vulnerabilities to both the economy and the military. 
10
(3) As deployment of clean energy technologies 
11
and emissions control devices increase, the demand 
12
for critical minerals will grow significantly. 
13
(4) The United States is import-reliant for 30 
14
of the 35 minerals designated as critical by the De-
15
partment of the Interior and relies completely on im-
16
ports to meet demand for 13 of these minerals. 
17
(5) Over the past two decades China has pro-
18
duced more than 80 percent of the world’s rare- 
19
earth elements and processed chemicals and has had 
20
similar supply control over other critical minerals. 
21
(6) China’s projected total metals demand 
22
growth rate suggests that within a decade China’s 
23
total annual metals demand will increase from to-
24
day’s 55% to more than 75% of the total world pro-
25
duction of all metals.

•HR 2637 IH
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
1
gress that to break from China’s control on the mineral 
2
supply chain, the United States should support significant 
3
research and development activities to drive innovation in 
4
domestic critical minerals production, promote responsible 
5
development of critical minerals, and encourage inter-
6
national collaboration to limit the impact of mineral sup-
7
ply disruptions.
