A BILL 
To establish a Federal program of cumulative impact assess-
ments under the Clean Water Act and Clean Air Act, 
and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Cumulative Impacts

Congress finds the following:

•HR 9218 IH
(1) All Americans, regardless of income, race, 
1
ethnicity, color, national origin, gender, or sexual 
2
identity, deserve to live in clean and healthy commu-
3
nities free from the burdens of environmental pollu-
4
tion and degradation. 
5
(2) Communities of color and lower-income 
6
communities have historically been subjected to dis-
7
proportionate amounts of air, water, and soil pollu-
8
tion, including pollution from numerous and con-
9
centrated industrial, commercial, and governmental 
10
facilities located in those communities. 
11
(3) As a result, residents of these overburdened 
12
communities have suffered from increased adverse 
13
health risks, including asthma, cancer, elevated 
14
blood lead levels, respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular 
15
disease, and developmental disorders. Children are 
16
most vulnerable to the effects of pollution and can 
17
suffer lifelong consequences. The adverse effects of 
18
pollution harm the well-being and stability of these 
19
communities and their residents. 
20
(4) These disproportionate burdens have been 
21
the consequence of policy decisions at all levels of 
22
government over many years, and government now 
23
has the responsibility and moral imperative to cor-
24
rect these injustices. 
25
23:08 Oct 25, 2022
H9218

•HR 9218 IH
(5) No community should bear a dispropor-
1
tionate share of the adverse environmental and pub-
2
lic health impacts of pollution caused by economic or 
3
any other activity. 
4
(6) Overburdened communities should be em-
5
powered legally and politically to participate in any 
6
decision to allow additional facilities which by their 
7
nature increase environmental and public health 
8
stressors to locate in their communities. 
9
(7) It is in the public interest to limit the fu-
10
ture placement and expansion of such facilities in 
11
overburdened communities. 
12
(8) The burden of proof that a proposed action 
13
will not harm communities should fall on polluting 
14
industries and on the Federal Government in its reg-
15
ulatory role, not the communities themselves. 
16
(9) Pollutants currently regulated by the Fed-
17
eral Government, including for example criteria air 
18
pollutants, may have additive and synergistic nega-
19
tive effects on human health and the environment 
20
when combined. 
21
(10) Cumulative impacts are the public health 
22
and environmental risks and impacts caused by the 
23
combined past, present, and reasonably foreseeable 
24
future releases of environmental pollution in a spe-
25

cific geographic area. Cumulative impact assessment 
1
considers sensitive populations and other social fac-
2
tors that may heighten vulnerability to environ-
3
mental pollution and associated health risks. 
4
(11) Cumulative impact assessments built into 
5
permitting decisions are one critical tool for pre-
6
venting increased environmental and public health 
7
degradation in overburdened communities. At its 
8
most basic, cumulative impact assessment requires 
9
studying the impacts of having multiple pollution 
10
sources and stressors combined together on public 
11
health and the environment. While the effects of a 
12
single pollutant from a single source may be less sig-
13
nificant when analyzed in isolation, the cumulative 
14
impacts of multiple pollutants from multiple sources 
15
in combination with each other and with other social 
16
vulnerabilities degrade public health and the environ-
17
ment substantially. Cumulative impact assessments 
18
should be incorporated into pollution permitting de-
19
cisions such that Federal regulators are required to 
20
deny permits that threaten public health and the en-
21
vironment. 
22
(12) The general failure of the Federal Govern-
23
ment to consider and regulate potential cumulative 
24
impacts in pollution permitting decisions has re-
25
23:08 Oct 25, 2022
H9218
5 
•HR 9218 IH
sulted in the inequitable distribution of pollution 
1
across regions and overburdening of certain commu-
2
nities. 
3
(13) Federal Government inaction has forced 
4
some State and local governments to act on their 
5
own to regulate cumulative impacts, including Cali-
6
fornia and New Jersey, creating a patchwork of cu-
7
mulative impact regulations across the country. 
8
(14) The Federal Government is aware of the 
9
importance of cumulative impact assessment in other 
10
types of environmental review, such as with environ-
11
mental assessments conducted under the National 
12
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 
13
et seq.). 
14
(15) The Federal Government should adopt and 
15
operationalize cumulative impact assessment in all 
16
pollution permitting decisions, especially in overbur-
17
dened communities, and should deny permits that 
18
create a reasonable certainty of harm to commu-
19
nities.
