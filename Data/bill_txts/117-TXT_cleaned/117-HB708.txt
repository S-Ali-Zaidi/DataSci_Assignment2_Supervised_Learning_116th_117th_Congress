A BILL 
To provide temporary licensing reciprocity for telehealth and 
interstate health care treatment. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Temporary Reciprocity 
4
to Ensure Access to Treatment Act’’ or the ‘‘TREAT 
5
Act’’. 
6
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
7
Congress finds the following: 
8
(1) It is necessary to regulate, on a temporary 
9
and emergency basis, the provision of interstate

commerce as it pertains to treatment by medical 
1
professionals licensed in one State to patients in 
2
other States. 
3
(2) COVID–19, the disease caused by SARS– 
4
CoV–2, has created a national public health emer-
5
gency, as declared by the Secretary of Health and 
6
Human Services under section 319 of the Public 
7
Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 247d) on January 
8
31, 2020, and by the President under the National 
9
Emergencies Act on March 13, 2020. 
10
(3) The COVID–19 pandemic has resulted in 
11
closing many businesses and nonprofit organizations, 
12
including colleges and universities, and large areas 
13
of the country remain under full or partial stay-at- 
14
home orders, precluding the ability to seek routine 
15
or elective medical treatment and consultation. The 
16
closing of campus-based in-person learning at insti-
17
tutions of higher education has also meant that up 
18
to 1,000,000 students have returned to live with 
19
their families across State lines from where they 
20
may have been receiving medical care in the univer-
21
sity setting. Furthermore, in many rural areas, in- 
22
person medical treatment is inaccessible. Even in 
23
urban areas, the pandemic has severely disrupted ac-
24
cess to medical care, requiring medical professionals 
25

licensed in one State to provide treatment to pa-
1
tients residing nearby but across a State line and 
2
unable to visit the medical professional’s office in 
3
the State of licensure. 
4
(4) It is vital that hospitals, temporary surge or 
5
field facilities, skilled nursing facilities, and nursing 
6
homes in areas with high caseloads of COVID–19 
7
patients be able to have access to qualified medical 
8
professionals, including such professionals licensed 
9
in other States, without the delays that would be re-
10
quired for individualized licensing during a time 
11
when State agencies’ capacity to review and process 
12
licensing requests are limited by the pandemic. 
13
(5) The provision of services by medical profes-
14
sionals, including services provided at no cost and 
15
services provided to patients in a State other than 
16
the State or States in which the medical professional 
17
maintains an office for professional services, affects 
18
interstate commerce. When used to provide services 
19
to patients located in a State other than the State 
20
in which the medical professional is located, tele-
21
health services, as defined in section 3, utilize facili-
22
ties of interstate commerce. 
23
(6) The inability of patients to visit in-State 
24
health care providers during the current crisis sub-
25
00:55 Mar 07, 2021

•HR 708 IH
stantially affects interstate commerce. Economic ac-
1
tivity has been limited by public health authorities 
2
and other government officials to ‘‘flatten the curve’’ 
3
of infections and hospitalizations and thereby pre-
4
vent the health care system from becoming over-
5
whelmed. Maximizing the efficient and effective use 
6
of health care resources is therefore vital to reopen-
7
ing the economy. 
8
(7) Barriers to the efficient delivery of health 
9
care services will lead to a shortage of those services 
10
that substantially affect health care availability 
11
across State lines. Shortages in health care services 
12
in one State prompt interstate travel to obtain 
13
health care in other States, even though discour-
14
aging such travel, particularly among the sick, is 
15
vital to containing the contagion and reopening the 
16
national economy.
