(2) as reported by the National Academy of 
3
Sciences in 2001, striking disparities exist in what 
4
children know and can do that are evident well be-
5
fore they enter kindergarten; these differences are 
6
strongly associated with social and economic cir-
7
cumstances, and they are predictive of subsequent 
8
academic performance; 
9
(3) research has consistently demonstrated that 
10
investments in high-quality programs that serve in-
11
fants and toddlers better position those children for 
12
success in elementary, secondary, and postsecondary 
13
education as well as helping children develop the 
14
critical physical, emotional, social, and cognitive 
15
skills that they will need for the rest of their lives; 
16

17
toddlers living in the United States and 49 percent 
18
of these children came from low-income families liv-
19

children, including those from low-income families, 
2

3
(6) MIECHV is an evidence-based policy initia-
4
tive and its authorizing legislation requires that at 
5
least 75 percent of funds dedicated to the program 
6
must support programs to implement evidence-based 
7
home visiting models, which includes the home-based 
8
model of Early Head Start; 
9
(7) in fiscal year 2016, MIECHV served ap-
10
proximately 160,000 parents and children, which is 
11
only a small portion of those eligible, in 893 counties 
12
covering all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and
