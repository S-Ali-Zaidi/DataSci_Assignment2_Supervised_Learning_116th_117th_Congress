A BILL 
To measure the progress of post-disaster recovery and efforts 
to address corruption, governance, rule of law, and media 
freedoms in Haiti. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Haiti Development, 
4
Accountability, and Institutional Transparency Initiative 
5
Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
7
Congress finds the following: 
8
(1) On January 12, 2010, a massive earth-
9
quake struck near the Haitian capital city of Port- 
10
23:36 May 27, 2021

•HR 2471 IH
au-Prince, leaving at least 220,000 people dead, in-
1
cluding 103 United States citizens, 101 United Na-
2
tions personnel, and nearly 18 percent of Haiti’s 
3
civil service, as well as 300,000 injured, 115,000 
4
homes destroyed, and 1,500,000 Haitians displaced. 
5
(2) The international community, led by the 
6
United States and the United Nations, mounted an 
7
unprecedented humanitarian response to the earth-
8
quake 
in 
Haiti. 
Through 
2018, 
more 
than 
9
$8,000,000,000 has been disbursed by donors. Since 
10
the 2010 earthquake, the United States Government 
11
has disbursed more than $4,000,000,000 in recovery 
12
and development funding. 
13
(3) On October 4, 2016, Hurricane Matthew 
14
struck southwestern Haiti on the Tiburon Peninsula, 
15
causing widespread damage and flooding and leaving 
16
1.4 million people in need of immediate assistance. 
17
Recovery efforts continue more than four years 
18
later. 
19
(4) Prior to both the 2010 earthquake and 
20
2016 hurricane, Haiti registered among the lowest 
21
in socioeconomic indicators and had the second high-
22
est rate of income disparity in the world—conditions 
23
that have further complicated disaster recovery and 
24
resilience efforts. As of November 2020, 4,400,000 
25
23:36 May 27, 2021
H2471
3 
•HR 2471 IH
people are in need of humanitarian assistance in 
1
Haiti. 
2
(5) With United States assistance, more than 
3
30,000 jobs have been created since the 2010 earth-
4
quake, largely in the apparel industry at the Caracol 
5
Industrial Park (in partnership with the Inter-Amer-
6
ican Development Bank, the Haitian Government, 
7
and the private sector) in northern Haiti. 
8
(6) Since 2018, tens of thousands of Haitians 
9
have participated in popular demonstrations de-
10
manding accountability over government manage-
11
ment of Petrocaribe resources. In early 2019, the 
12
Haitian superior court of auditors released a series 
13
of reports implicating high-level government officials 
14
in the misappropriation of funds. 
15
(7) The United Nations Human Rights Office 
16
of the High Commissioner and the Human Rights 
17
Service jointly found a 333 percent increase in 
18
human rights violations and abuses against the 
19
rights of life and security from July 2018 through 
20
December 2019. There were 131 violations in 2018 
21
and 567 violations in 2019, including the shooting of 
22
at least one journalist covering the protests. 
23
(8) Leading members of civil society have faced 
24
attacks, including Monferrier Dorval, a constitu-
25
23:36 May 27, 2021

•HR 2471 IH
tional law expert and president of the Port-au- 
1
Prince bar who was killed on August 28, 2020. 
2
(9) On November 13, 2018, according to the 
3
Haitian National Human Rights Defense Network, 
4
at least 71 people were shot and killed and 18 peo-
5
ple were raped in the Port-au-Prince neighborhood 
6
of La Saline. 
7
(10) On December 10, 2020, the Department of 
8
the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control des-
9
ignated former Haitian National Police officer 
10
Jimmy Cherizier, former Director General of the 
11
Ministry of the Interior Fednel Monchery, and 
12
former Departmental Delegate Joseph Pierre Rich-
13
ard Duplan pursuant to the Global Magnitsky Exec-
14
utive Order for being foreign persons responsible for 
15
or complicit in, or having directly or indirectly en-
16
gaged in, serious human rights abuse for their con-
17
nection to the La Saline massacre. 
18
(11) Following the La Saline massacre, similar 
19
attacks have occurred in Port-au-Prince neighbor-
20
hoods, including the November 2019 and August 
21
2020 attacks on Bel Air, in which 24 people were 
22
killed and hundreds of families were displaced. 
23
(12) Parliamentary elections scheduled for Oc-
24
tober 2019 did not take place, and since January

•HR 2471 IH
13, 2020, President Jovenel Moı¨se has ruled by de-
1
cree. At least five decrees have been cited as increas-
2
ingly authoritarian by Haitian civic and political 
3
leaders and the international community, including 
4
the October 30, 2020, decision to constitute a five- 
5
member group to draft a new constitution, the No-
6
vember 6, 2020, decision to reduce the control of 
7
anti-corruption entities like the Superior Court of 
8
Accounts and Administrative Litigation, the Novem-
9
ber 26, 2020, anti-terrorism decree that establishes 
10
sanctions applicable to Haitian police officers not 
11
stopping demonstrations, the November 26, 2020, 
12
creation of the National Intelligence Agency, and the 
13
February 11, 2021, appointment of three new judges 
14
to the Supreme Court of Haiti outside of constitu-
15
tional procedures. 
16
(13) Although there has been no parliament in 
17
place since January 2020, the Haitian Government 
18
approved a budget on September 30, 2020, but the 
19
delay prevented the International Monetary Fund 
20
and other multilaterals from disbursing millions in 
21
international assistance. 
22
(14) In September 2020, President Moı¨se by-
23
passed the Supreme Court to appoint a Provisional 
24
Electoral Council (CEP) by executive decree. Several 
25
21:09 Jun 03, 2021

6 
•HR 2471 IH
civil society groups that traditionally participate in 
1
Haiti’s electoral councils criticized the decision and 
2
have declined to be represented in the CEP. 
3
(15) On February 7, 2021, President Moı¨se al-
4
leged that a coup had been attempted against him 
5
leading to 23 subsequent arrests, including of Judge 
6
Yviquel Dabre´sil of the Supreme Court of Haiti. The 
7
Department of State noted that ‘‘the situation re-
8
mains murky and we await the results of the police 
9
investigation’’. President Moı¨se later forced the re-
10
tirement of three Supreme Court judges on Feb-
11
ruary 9, 2021, who were named as possible transi-
12
tional presidents by political opponents, and replaced 
13
them with individuals he unilaterally selected.
