SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘PrEP Access and Cov-
2
erage Act’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
4
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds as follows: 
5
(1) The Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
6
vention estimates that approximately 1,100,000 peo-
7
ple in the United States are living with HIV. 
8
(2) In 2019, there were 36,398 new diagnoses 
9
of HIV in the United States. 
10
(3) HIV disproportionately impacts gay and bi-
11
sexual men, transgender women, and, in particular, 
12
people of color. For example, in 2019, approximately 
13
66 percent of new HIV diagnoses were among gay 
14
and bisexual men, 42 percent of new HIV diagnoses 
15
were among Black people, and 22 percent of new 
16
HIV diagnoses were among Latinx people. Recent 
17
studies suggest that transgender women are up to 
18
49 times more likely to be diagnosed with HIV than 
19
the general population. Members of communities at 
20
the intersections of these groups are most heavily 
21
impacted. 
22
(4) Pre-exposure prophylaxis (referred to in this 
23
section as ‘‘PrEP’’) is a daily antiretroviral medica-
24
tion that helps prevent individuals from acquiring 
25
HIV. Daily PrEP use reduces the risk of getting 
26
23:23 Dec 10, 2021
H6117
3 
•HR 6117 IH
HIV from sex by about 99 percent. It reduces the 
1
risk of getting HIV from injection drug use by at 
2
least 74 percent. 
3
(5) Many individuals at risk of exposure to HIV 
4
do not use PrEP. Of the approximately 1,100,000 
5
people in the United States who could benefit from 
6
PrEP, only 23 percent, or nearly 285,000 individ-
7
uals, filled prescriptions for the drug in 2019. 
8
(6) PrEP usage is inconsistent across racial 
9
and gender lines. In 2019, only 8 percent of Black/ 
10
African American and 14 percent of Hispanic/Latinx 
11
persons who were eligible for PrEP were prescribed 
12
it, compared to 63 percent of White persons. Addi-
13
tionally, slightly less than 10 percent of women eligi-
14
ble for PrEP received a prescription in 2019. 
15
(7) There are currently 2 brand name drugs 
16
and 1 generic drug approved by the Food and Drug 
17
Administration for the use of PrEP on a daily basis. 
18
Other types of HIV prevention treatments, including 
19
a long-acting injectable, which is currently under 
20
FDA review, and long-acting oral pills, implants, 
21
and vaginal rings are in the research pipeline. These 
22
new innovations can increase widespread use of 
23
PrEP along with adherence, which can speed the

Nation’s goal to end HIV and address inequities in 
1
health care. 
2
(8) Section 2713 of the Public Health Service 
3
Act (42 U.S.C. 300gg–13) requires most private 
4
health insurance plans to cover preventive services 
5
without cost-sharing, including such services with a 
6
rating of ‘‘A’’ or ‘‘B’’ under recommendations of the 
7
United States Preventive Services Task Force. On 
8
June 11, 2019, the United States Preventive Serv-
9
ices Task Force issued a final recommendation giv-
10
ing an ‘‘A’’ grade for PrEP for individuals at high 
11
risk of HIV; non-grandfathered private health insur-
12
ance plans have to cover PrEP for such individuals 
13
without cost-sharing effective January 2021. 
14
(9) Joint guidance issued by the Department of 
15
Labor, the Department of Health and Human Serv-
16
ices, and the Department of the Treasury on July 
17
19, 2021, clarifies that ancillary services necessary 
18
to maintain the PrEP regime, including subsequent 
19
provider visits, clinical testing, and other services, is 
20
required to be covered by health insurers without 
21
cost-sharing. 
22
(10) Permanently expanding access to cost-free 
23
PrEP and ancillary services for all individuals, in-
24
cluding individuals who do not have health insur-

ance, through legislation, is a critical step towards 
1
eliminating HIV transmission. 
2
(11) Post-exposure prophylaxis (referred to in 
3
this section as ‘‘PEP’’) is a daily antiretroviral 
4
treatment which, when initiated promptly after a 
5
sexual or other exposure to blood or body fluids that 
6
is associated with a high risk of HIV transmission, 
7
is highly effective at preventing HIV infection. 
8
(12) The Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
9
vention recommends PEP for an individual who has 
10
experienced a high-risk exposure incident, provided 
11
that the individual tests HIV-negative, initiates such 
12
treatment no later than 72 hours after exposure, 
13
and continues the treatment for 28 days. 
14
(13) Despite PEP’s proven effectiveness in pre-
15
venting HIV infection after high-risk sexual expo-
16
sures, awareness of PEP is low among individuals 
17
who would benefit from the treatment. Studies sug-
18
gest that awareness of PEP and of the importance 
19
of its prompt initiation is particularly low among 
20
young gay and bisexual men of color, transgender 
21
persons, and women of all gender identities. 
22
(14) Adequate knowledge of guidelines issued 
23
by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
24
for assessing indications for PEP and for initiating 
25
23:23 Dec 10, 2021

•HR 6117 IH
and sustaining PEP are low among health care pro-
1
viders and staff. Because PEP is an emergency 
2
intervention, insufficient knowledge among providers 
3
and staff in hospital emergency rooms, urgent care 
4
centers, community health centers, and primary care 
5
physicians is of particular concern. 
6
(15) Private and public health insurance plans 
7
and programs frequently impose requirements for 
8
coverage of PEP, including pre-authorization re-
9
quirements and requirements to obtain the medica-
10
tions through designated specialty pharmacies and 
11
mail-order programs that pose significant obstacles 
12
to timely initiation of treatment. 
13
(16) Insurance deductibles and co-payments for 
14
PEP medications create significant barriers to PEP 
15
utilization by many individuals who have experienced 
16
high-risk incidents. 
17
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
18
gress that the Department of Labor, the Department of 
19
Health and Human Services, and the Department of the 
20
Treasury should ensure compliance with the requirements
