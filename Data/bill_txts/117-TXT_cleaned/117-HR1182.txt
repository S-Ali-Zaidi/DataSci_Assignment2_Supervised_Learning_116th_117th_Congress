RESOLUTION 
Recognizing June 19, 2022, as this year’s observance of 
the historical significance of Juneteenth Independence Day. 
Whereas news of the end of slavery did not reach frontier 
areas of the United States, and in particular the South-
western States, for more than 21⁄2 years after President 
Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation, which was issued 
on January 1, 1863, and months after the conclusion of 
the Civil War; 
Whereas, on June 19, 1865, Union soldiers led by Major 
General Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston, Texas,

with news that the Civil War had ended and that the 
enslaved were free; 
Whereas African-Americans who had been slaves in the 
Southwest celebrated June 19th, commonly known as 
‘‘Juneteenth Independence Day’’, as the anniversary of 
their emancipation; 
Whereas African-Americans from the Southwest continue the 
tradition of celebrating Juneteenth Independence Day as 
inspiration and encouragement for future generations; 
Whereas for more than 150 years, Juneteenth Independence 
Day celebrations have been held to honor African-Amer-
ican freedom while encouraging self-development and re-
spect for all cultures; 
Whereas, on June 18, 2020, H.R. 7232, the Juneteenth Na-
tional Independence Day Act was introduced and reintro-
duced as H.R. 1320, on February 25, 2021, in the House 
of Representatives, marking the first time in Congress a 
bill had been introduced to declare Juneteenth a Federal 
holiday; 
Whereas, on June 17, 2022, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., 
signed into law the bill that established Juneteenth as a 
Federal holiday, one day before the first anniversary of 
the introduction of H.R. 7232, making it the most recent 
addition to the list of Federal holidays; and 
Whereas the faith and strength of character demonstrated by 
former slaves remains an example for all people of the 
United States, regardless of background, religion, or 
race: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That —
