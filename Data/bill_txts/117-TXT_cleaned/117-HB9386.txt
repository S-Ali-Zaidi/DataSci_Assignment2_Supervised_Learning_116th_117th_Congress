A BILL 
To protect clean air and public health by expanding fenceline 
and ambient air monitoring and access to air quality 
information for communities affected by air pollution, 
to require hazardous air pollutant monitoring at the 
fenceline of facilities whose emissions are linked to local 
health threats, to ensure the Environmental Protection 
Agency promulgates rules that require hazardous air pol-
lutant data measurement and electronic submission at 
fencelines and stacks of industrial source categories, to 
expand and strengthen the national ambient air quality

of the relevant pollutant reached 98 percent of 
5
the level of the national ambient air quality

standard under section 109 of the Clean Air
