RESOLUTION 
Encouraging the Department of Agriculture to lead efforts, 
in partnerships with States, localities, universities, and 
various farming and ranching groups, to prepare for 
the disruptive transformation of the entire agriculture 
industry. 
Whereas the world’s population is expected to reach 7.8 bil-
lion people in 2021; 
Whereas demographic trends point to an estimated 10.9 bil-
lion people on Earth by 2100; 
Whereas as populations grow and urbanization expands, rural 
and agricultural land decreases;

Whereas climate change over the coming decades will increase 
the unpredictability of weather patterns for crops and 
water supply; 
Whereas advances in discovering genetic diversity in plants 
allow for an increase in plant species diversification, 
which can provide immunity against diseases that could 
cause entire plant species to die out; 
Whereas recent breakthroughs in photosynthesis in certain 
plant species raise the possibility of increasing crop yields 
on less land; 
Whereas biotechnology, including gene-editing and CRISPR, 
synthetic biology, and other modern techniques are im-
perative for crops to survive a changing climate and in-
creasing productivity on less arable land with less water 
to meet a growing world population; 
Whereas science has proven countless times that such foods 
are safe for human and animal consumption; 
Whereas the Department of Agriculture and various academic 
institutions have focused on research and development of 
innovative biotechnologies; 
Whereas outreach and education to farmers growing such 
crops remain imperative; and 
Whereas expanding acceptance for gene-edited crops is nec-
essary, including for cross-border trade and consumption: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
