A BILL 
To establish the Avi Kwa Ame National Monument in the 
State of Nevada, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Avi Kwa Ame National 
4
Monument Establishment Act of 2022’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds as follows: 
7
(1) The Federal public lands in southernmost 
8
Nevada comprise a nationally significant cultural 
9
and natural landscape.

(2) These lands are considered sacred by nu-
1
merous Indian Tribes, and the lands are tied to the 
2
Indian Tribes’ creation, cosmology, and well-being, 
3
containing numerous cultural sites and objects. 
4
(3) Avi Kwa Ame, or Spirit Mountain, located 
5
on the eastern edge of the proposed monument, is 
6
designated a Traditional Cultural Property on the 
7
National Register of Historic Places in recognition 
8
of its religious and cultural importance. 
9
(4) The lands showcase the progression of 
10
human history in the Eastern Mojave Desert, a lit-
11
eral crossroads of the American West. There are sig-
12
nificant elements of Native American, Western- 
13
American, and Mining History, including the historic 
14
Mojave Trail/Road, originally used by Mojave and 
15
other Native Americans to transport goods from the 
16
southwest to trade with the Chumash and other 
17
coastal Tribes and later used in Western expansion, 
18
as well as the historic Walking Box Ranch which fig-
19
ures prominently in the history of movie making in 
20
America. 
21
(5) The lands contain several prominent geo-
22
logical features, such as the volcanic Highland 
23
Range within the northern section of the Avi Kwa 
24
Ame landscape, which is about 10 miles long and re-
25

markably rugged and ragged. The multicolored vol-
1
canic peaks, several thousand feet in elevation, tower 
2
above the surrounding valley and are remarkably 
3
scenic and are a designated Crucial Bighorn Sheep 
4
Habitat area. 
5
(6) The lands are a rare biological hotspot that 
6
contain intact ecosystems, Joshua tree forests, out-
7
standing wildlife habitat, and essential wildlife mi-
8
gration corridors. 
9
(7) The remote nature of the area protects the 
10
ability to enjoy increasingly rare natural quiet and 
11
dark night sky and solitude. 
12
(8) The lands provide important recreational 
13
opportunities. 
14
(9) Establishing the Federal public lands within 
15
the Avi Kwa Ame landscape as a national monument 
16
will permanently protect these natural and cultural 
17
resources for the benefit and enjoyment of present 
18
and future generations.
