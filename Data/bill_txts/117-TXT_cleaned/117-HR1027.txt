portant health outcomes outside of the pandemic such as 
maternal mortality; 
Whereas, in 2020, the life expectancy at birth for the popu-
lation of the United States declined by 1.5 years, which 
is the largest drop in life expectancy since 1943; 
Whereas many of the leading causes of death for individuals 
in the United States result from chronic conditions, 
which are among the most common, costly, and prevent-
able of all health challenges; 
Whereas there are significant differences in the health status 
of individuals living in the healthiest States and those liv-
ing in the least healthy States, including differences in 
obesity rates, the prevalence of chronic disease, and the 
prevalence of infectious disease; 
Whereas racial and ethnic minority populations in the United 
States continue to experience disparities in the burden of 
illness and death, as compared with the entire population 
of the United States; 
Whereas violence is a leading cause of premature death, and 
it is estimated that more than 7 individuals per hour die 
a violent death in the United States; 
Whereas deaths from homicides cost the economy of the 
United States billions of dollars, and the violence of 
homicides can cause social and emotional distress, com-
munity trauma, injury, disability, depression, anxiety, 
and post-traumatic stress disorder; 
Whereas over 47,500 lives were lost due to suicide in 2019, 
and in May 2020, during the COVID–19 pandemic,

Whereas an estimated 1 in 7 children in the United States 
experience child abuse and neglect, with 1,840 children 
dying of abuse and neglect in 2019; 
Whereas despite significant progress in reducing the infant

5.6 infant deaths per 1,000 live births in 2019, the in-
fant mortality rate in the United States still greatly var-
ies among States; 
Whereas women die from pregnancy-related complications in 
the United States at a higher rate than in many other 
developed countries, and an estimated 60 percent of ma-
ternal deaths in the United States are preventable;

3 to 4 times higher than White mothers; 
Whereas there were an estimated 100,306 drug overdose 
deaths in the United States during the 12-month period

percent from the 78,056 deaths during the same period 
the year before; 
Whereas cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable 
disease and death in the United States, accounting for 
more than 480,000 deaths every year, including more

use; 
Whereas data from the National Youth Tobacco Survey 
showed that in 2020 almost 40 percent of high school e- 
cigarette users were using an e-cigarette on 20 or more 
days out of the month, and almost a quarter of high 
school e-cigarette users were using e-cigarettes every day,

19,000 of deaths in 2018; 
Whereas, from 2018 to 2019, the United States spent nearly 
$13 per person on climate change adaptation in the 
health sector, far less than what is needed to prevent the 
growing health impacts of climate change; 
Whereas, in 2016, fine particulate air pollution led to more 
than 64,000 premature deaths in the United States, and 
Black and Hispanic individuals in the United States were 
disproportionately impacted; 
Whereas voting helps shape the conditions in which people 
can be healthy, and good health is consistently positively 
associated with higher likelihood of voter participation; 
Whereas public health organizations use National Public 
Health Week to educate public policymakers and public 
health professionals on issues that are important to im-
proving the health of the people of the United States; 
Whereas studies show that small strategic investments in dis-
ease prevention can result in significant savings in health 
care costs;

Whereas vaccination is one of the most significant public 
health achievements in history and has resulted in sub-

associated with vaccine-preventable diseases; and

able diseases; 
Whereas each 10-percent increase in local public health

demic;

severe storms; and 
(3) other disasters, including disasters caused by 
human activity and public health emergencies; 
Whereas public health professionals collaborate with partners 
outside of the health sector, including city planners, 
transportation officials, education officials, and private 
sector businesses, recognizing that other sectors can in-
fluence health outcomes; 
Whereas in communities across the United States, individuals 
are changing the way they care for their health by avoid-
ing tobacco use, eating healthier, increasing physical ac-
