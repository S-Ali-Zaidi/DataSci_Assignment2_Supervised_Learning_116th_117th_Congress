It is the policy of the United States that— 
5
(1) the United States should aggressively re-
6
duce greenhouse gas emissions to achieve the Biden 
7
administration’s climate change commitments which 
8
align with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
9
Change (IPCC) pathway for a 66-percent chance of 
10
avoiding 1.5 degrees Celsius warming, and should 
11
harness the full potential of America’s public lands 
12
and waters to help deliver on these critical emission 
13
reduction goals; 
14
(2) public lands should be managed to rapidly 
15
reduce greenhouse gas emissions and co-pollutant 
16
emissions and to respond to unavoidable impacts of 
17
climate change through increased resilience of eco-
18
systems and wildlife habitats;

(3) the protection of ocean ecosystems is vital

to promoting ocean health and increasing resilience

2

(4) energy development and production deci-
4

5
by the goals of— 
6
(A) protecting human well-being, biodiver-
7
sity, and the environment for present and fu-
8
ture generations; 
9
(B) avoiding the most harmful impacts of

and equitable transition to a clean energy econ-
13
omy; and

(D) preserving natural carbon storage

16
(5) Tribal nations and environmental justice 
17
communities are more vulnerable to the direct and 
18
indirect effects of emissions from public lands and 
19
oceans and often have the least resources to re-
20
spond; thus, they should be meaningfully engaged in 
21
government decision making as our Nation reduces 
22
emissions from public lands and oceans and builds 
23
its climate resilience against the effects of those

13
States and communities that will result from the

8
shall first be subjected to a climate screening policy before

12
termination in that Emissions Reduction Strategy. Condi-
13
tions the Secretary must consider in a climate screening 
14
tool include, at a minimum— 
15
(1) whether the mass of lifecycle greenhouse 
16
gas emissions associated with any proposed leasing 
17
action, including lease sales and the issuance of re-

19
pathways for meeting climate targets; and

21
ing action would remain economically viable in a
