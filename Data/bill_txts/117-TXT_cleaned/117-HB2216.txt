SEC. 2. PURPOSE. 
1
It is the purpose of this Act to provide women with 
2
increased access to preventive and life-saving cancer 
3
screening, including clinical breast exams and cervical, 
4
ovarian, uterine, vaginal, and vulvar cancer screening, pro-
5
vided by leading women’s health care providers who— 
6
(1) serve populations most at risk; and 
7
(2) play an outsized role in the prevention and 
8
detection of cancer in order to serve the goal of in-
9
creasing access to quality health screenings, care, 
10
and services, reducing health care disparities and 
11
mortality rates among low-income women and 
12
women of color, decreasing health care spending, 
13
and expanding health literacy, access, and education 
14
about the benefits of regular preventive cancer 
15
screening for women. 
16
SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
17
Congress finds as follows: 
18
(1) Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer 
19
death in women under the age of 54, and the Amer-
20
ican Cancer Society recommends that women in 
21
their 20s and 30s have a clinical breast exam at 
22
least every 3 years. 
23
(2) Ovarian cancer causes more deaths than 
24
any other cancer of the female reproductive system, 
25
04:37 May 25, 2021
H2216
3 
•HR 2216 IH
but it accounts for only about 3 percent of all can-
1
cers in women. 
2
(3) The cancers that most frequently impact 
3
women include breast, uterine, ovarian, and cervical 
4
cancer, and there were 341,171 new cases of these 
5
cancers in 2017. 
6
(4) Rates of incidence and death for gynecologic 
7
cancers by race and ethnicity show that, while for 
8
some cancers, like ovarian cancer, the rates of inci-
9
dence and death are similar among all races, for 
10
other cancers, like cervical cancer, women of color 
11
have disproportionate incidence and mortality rates. 
12
While the incidence of uterine cancer is similar for 
13
White women and Women of Color, rates of death 
14
for uterine cancer are 2 times higher for Black 
15
women than for White women. 
16
(5) Cervical cancer incidence and mortality 
17
rates are higher for women living in rural and un-
18
derserved regions in the United States. Women liv-
19
ing in these areas face unique barriers in accessing 
20
reproductive health care services to prevent and 
21
treat cervical cancer, including a lack of practicing 
22
gynecologists in rural areas and challenges around 
23
transportation to preventive and follow-up appoint-
24
ments. 
25
04:37 May 25, 2021
H2216
4 
•HR 2216 IH
(6) Prevention and cancer screening are the 
1
best approaches to protecting women from cancer 
2
and ensuring early detection and life-saving treat-
3
ment. Many deaths from breast and cervical cancers 
4
could be avoided if cancer screening rates and diag-
5
nostic care and services increased among women at 
6
risk. Deaths from these cancers occur disproportion-
7
ately among women who are uninsured or under-
8
insured. 
9
(7) Due to enhanced screening, cervical cancer, 
10
which used to be the leading cause of cancer death 
11
for women in the United States, is now a much more 
12
preventable and treatable cancer. It is also highly 
13
curable when found and treated early. 
14
(8) Increased access to education, information, 
15
including information on the human papillomavirus 
16
vaccine, and preventive cancer screening increase 
17
women’s ability to survive cancer. 
18
(9) While more than 15 percent of cases of cer-
19
vical cancer are found in women over the age of 65, 
20
it becomes less likely that women are tested for cer-
21
vical cancer ever or within the previous 5 years as 
22
their age increases. 
23
(10) Women’s health care providers that are 
24
primarily engaged in family planning services, such 
25
04:37 May 25, 2021
H2216
5 
•HR 2216 IH
as Planned Parenthood health centers, provide nec-
1
essary screening tests, education, and information to 
2
women, especially women of color who face the high-
3
est risks of breast cancer and other gynecologic can-
4
cers. 
5
(11) Access to preventive gynecological screen-
6
ing is also critical for transgender men who have 
7
comparable rates of susceptibility to cervical cancer 
8
as cisgender women, but often have less access to 
9
preventive screenings. 
10
(12) Discrimination and racism in health care 
11
continues to contribute to disparate rates of gyneco-
12
logical cancer in non-White women. Black, Indige-
13
nous, and other Women of Color die at higher rates 
14
from cervical cancer than White women, even though 
15
fewer women overall die from cervical cancer. 
16
(13) Black women with endometrial cancer 
17
often receive surgery less often than White women 
18
and are more likely to be diagnosed at an advanced 
19
stage of the disease, contributing to disparities in 
20
mortality in Black women.
