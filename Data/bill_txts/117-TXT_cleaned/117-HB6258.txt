section (b) using relevant scientific, social, and economic

3
assessment, the Secretary may consider a cluster of loca-
4
tions in close proximity with similar conditions as a single 
5
inventory item, provided that each of the locations meets 
6
the criteria established in this section. Based on the fac-
7

8
in section 101, the Secretary shall make a determination 
9
based on the totality of the circumstances whether a site 
10
under consideration is suitable for sustainable offshore 
11
aquaculture. If the Secretary determines that a site is 
12
suitable, then the site shall be listed in the inventory, 
13
along with— 
14
(1) a description of the site, including its co-
15
ordinates and a map; 
16
(2) a thorough evaluation of each factor de-
17
scribed in subsection (d), and the Secretary’s find-
18
ings regarding each of those factors; and

20
Secretary’s determination that the site is suitable for 
21
sustainable offshore aquaculture.

8
uses of the site, and the areas in reasonable prox-
9
imity to the site.

escape of cultured species, or from cultured species 
12
becoming invasive or hybridizing with wild stocks 
13
within the region.

15
culture, where cultured species provide ecosystem 
16
services to one another.

18
ture and other land-based support facilities to sup-
19
port offshore aquaculture operations.

Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. App.), 
12
convene workshops of particular aquaculture stake-
13

PETITION.—The Governor of any 
12
coastal State or territory, or a Tribal government in 
13
a fisheries management region under the Magnuson-

11
OPPORTUNITY
AREAS.—The Secretary may adjust 
12
the dimensions of an established aquaculture oppor-
13
tunity area as necessary, while accounting for im-

(g) DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS.—In order to test 
19
the viability of sustainable offshore aquaculture in a site 
20
