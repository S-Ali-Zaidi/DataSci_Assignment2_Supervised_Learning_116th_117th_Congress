A BILL 
To amend title 10, United States Code, to codify certain 
clean energy targets of the Department of Defense, and 
for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Depend on Domestic 
4
Clean Energy Act’’ or the ‘‘DOD Clean Energy Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) The Department of Defense, the agency 
8
charged with protecting the national security of the 
9
15:43 Jun 03, 2022
H7882

•HR 7882 IH
United States, observed as early as 1990 that cli-
1
mate change threatens our military readiness. 
2
(2) As of 2019, the Department of Defense is 
3
the single largest consumer of energy in the United 
4
States, and the single largest institutional consumer 
5
of petroleum in the world. 
6
(3) Since 2001, the Department of Defense has 
7
consistently consumed between 77 and 80 percent of 
8
all energy consumption of the United States Govern-
9
ment. 
10
(4) As climate change brings more extreme 
11
weather, water and soil stress, sea-level rise, ocean 
12
acidification, glacial melt, and pollution, greater 
13
global tensions over food and water insecurity, re-
14
source scarcity, living patterns, and climate-related 
15
migration will emerge. 
16
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
17
It is the sense of Congress that any unobligated 
18
amounts for the Energy Resilience and Conservation In-
19
vestment Program of the Department of Defense at the 
20
end of fiscal year 2022 should remain available for obliga-
21
tion by the Department after such fiscal year for deserving 
22
projects so that the Department is able to appropriately 
23
vet those projects while increasing staffing.
