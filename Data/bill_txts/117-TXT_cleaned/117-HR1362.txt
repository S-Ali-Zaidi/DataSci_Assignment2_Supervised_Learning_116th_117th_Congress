Articles of Impeachment exhibited by the House of 
1
Representatives of the United States of America in the 
2
name of itself and of the people of the United States of

High Crimes and Misdemeanors’’. 
14
In his conduct as President of the United States, in

office of the President of the United States, and, to the 
17
best of his ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Con-
18
stitution of the United States—Joseph Robinette Biden 
19

President Biden’s decision to liquidate the United 
1
States Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) demonstrates 
2
his administration is more concerned with enriching other 
3
nations than protecting United States citizens at home, 
4
even when those nations do not need United States’ oil 
5
to survive. 
6
According to Reuters News on July 5, 2022, ‘‘more 
7
than 5 million barrels of oil that were part of a historic 
8
U.S. emergency reserves release. . .were exported to Eu-
9
rope and Asia last month, according to data and sources, 
10
even as U.S. gasoline and diesel prices hit record highs’’. 
11
Reuters further reported that ‘‘cargoes of SPR crude 
12
oil were also headed to the Netherlands and to a Reliance 
13
refinery in India, an industry source said. A third cargo 
14
headed to China, another source said. . .the latest exports 
15
follow three vessels that carried SPR crude oil to Europe 
16
in April helping replace Russian crude oil supplies’’. 
17
India and China do not need oil from the United 
18
States since both Asian nations import oil from Russia. 
19
In fact, Business Standard reported that India’s oil im-
20
ports from Russia jumped ‘‘over 50 times since April 
21
[2022]’’. Reuters relayed that China’s imports of Russian 
22
oil from May 2022 set a record, surpassing Saudi Arabia 
23
as the top oil exporter to China.

India spent $5,000,000,000 on Russian oil in the 
1
first part of 2022, a five-fold increase from their pur-
2
chases of oil from 2021. 
3
According 
to 
Bloomberg, 
China 
spent 
4
$19,000,000,000 on Russian oil, gas, and coal in the first 
5
part of 2022, double the amount they spent on the same 
6
resources over the same period in 2021. 
7
While citizens of the United States are facing ex-
8
treme price increases for food and fuel under Biden’s pres-
9
idency, his administration is selling the United States’ 
10
emergency fuel supply to China and other nations.

ARTICLE II

13
President Biden’s decision to liquidate the SPR re-
14
veals his plan to endanger the security of the United 
15
States, both economically and politically, while empow-
16
ering adversaries to do grave harm to us and our allies. 
17
Congress authorized the creation of the SPR in 1975 
18
under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. 
19
By December 1994, the SPR had been filled to 
20
591,700,000 barrels. 
21
In mid-November of 2001, President George W. Bush 
22
ordered the SPR filled to 700,000,000 barrels. 
23
The SPR was filled to its then 727-million-barrel au-
24
thorized storage capacity on December 27, 2009; the in-

ventory of 726,600,000 barrels was the highest ever held 
1
in the SPR. 
2
The SPR’s current authorized storage capacity is 
3
714,000,000 barrels of crude oil. 
4
When President Joe Biden entered office, the SPR 
5
contained 638,000,000 barrels of crude oil. In 2021, the 
6
United States consumed an average of 19,780,000 barrels 
7
of petroleum per day, a total of 7,220,000,000 barrels of 
8
petroleum. 
9
In 2021, 134,830,000,000 gallons of finished motor 
10
gasoline was consumed in the United States, an average 
11
of about 369,000,000 gallons per day. 
12
In 2021, diesel fuel consumption by the United States 
13
transportation sector was 46,820,000,000 gallons, an av-
14
erage of about 128,000,000 gallons per day. 
15
President Biden announced on March 31, 2022, that 
16
his administration would begin releasing at least 
17
1,000,000 barrels of oil from the SPR on a daily basis, 
18
with a target total of more than 180,000,000 barrels of 
19
oil. 
20
The national average price of unleaded gasoline and 
21
diesel fuel in June 2022, was $5, an all-time high. 
22
The SPR currently holds 427,200,000 barrels of 
23
crude oil as of September 16, 2022. This is after Reuters 
24
02:52 Sep 20, 2022
HR1362

•HRES 1362 IH 
reported in August that the SPR ‘‘fell to the lowest level 
1
since 1984’’. 
2
No President in the history of the United States has 
3
ordered a liquidation of the SPR of this scale. Even in 
4
1991, during the Gulf war, the United States liquidated 
5
only 17,000,000 barrels of crude oil from the SPR to pro-
6
vide further stability to the global crude oil market. Fol-
7
lowing Hurricane Katrina, the United States released 
8
some 20,000,000 barrels of crude oil to the United States 
9
domestic market following the destruction of major oil re-
10
fineries in the gulf coast region. 
11
In 2021, the Department of Energy sold crude oil 
12
from the SPR to a foreign government for the first time. 
13
President Biden is emptying the SPR of medium-sour 
14
crude oil, which is a crucial type of oil that domestic refin-
15
ers process into gasoline. The Department of Energy re-
16
leased 4,600,000 barrels of medium-sour crude oil in late 
17
July. This decision could cause oil prices to skyrocket in 
18
the long-term as refineries seek to re-acquire more easily 
19
processed crude. 
20
President Biden’s decision to liquidate this enormous 
21
amount of crude oil from the SPR has put the United 
22
States in unprecedented danger by reducing its essential 
23
supply of natural resources in the event of a natural dis-
24
aster, global supply chain crisis, or war.

•HRES 1362 IH 
President Biden’s decision to deplete the SPR is un-
1
necessary, since the United States had already materially 
2
demonstrated that it was energy-independent and fully ca-
3
pable of producing sufficient amounts of crude oil domesti-
4
cally under the Trump administration. 
5
These actions demonstrate a concerted effort to de-
6
prive the United States of its energy stability and security 
7
while providing other nations with essential goods and 
8
services. 
9
President Biden’s decision to ban United States im-
10
ports of Russian oil has provided Russia with more rea-
11
sons to sell oil to India and China, increasing the economic 
12
ties between those nations and empowering the strength 
13
of the Russian ruble as the United States dollar declines. 
14
Russia has amassed $13,000,000,000 in additional 
15
oil revenue from India and China in 2022, compared to 
16
the same period in 2021. 
17
President Biden’s decision to send crude oil from the 
18
SPR to China is a blatantly strategic sabotage against the 
19
United States, a move which will only serve to assist Chi-
20
na’s ascendancy to displace the United States as the global 
21
economic and military hegemon. 
22
China is likely to use the oil received from the SPR 
23
to empower its military to invade Taiwan at a future date.

The White House Press Secretary stated in July 
1
2022, that she was not aware of the reports outlining the 
2
transfer of SPR barrels to China, indisputably the United 
3
States’ major geopolitical adversary. 
4
These actions demonstrate that the Biden adminis-
5
tration has intentionally aided and abetted foreign powers 
6
rather than address the rising economic burdens faced by 
7
millions of citizens of the United States.

President Biden’s decision to liquidate the SPR 
11
plainly shows his disdain for the plight of citizens of the 
12
United States who are facing the worst inflationary crisis 
13
since June 1981. 
14
Citizens of the United States are struggling to afford 
15
basic goods and services because of the rampant inflation 
16
caused by Democrat’s out-of-control spending and the 
17
Federal Reserve’s loose monetary policy.

The following increases in the average retail food and 
19
energy prices, according to the Bureau of Labor and Sta-
20
tistics, since July of 2021, includes—

3
(8) gasoline, per gallon, by 43.4-percent; and

(9) diesel fuel, per gallon, by 69.6-percent. 
5
President Biden canceled the continued construction 
6
of the Keystone XL Pipeline and plans to block all new 
7
drilling in the Atlantic and Pacific ocean regions within 
8
United States waters. 
9
The Biden administration has canceled Federal land 
10
and offshore leasing permits, increased regulation and 
11
proposed taxes, depleted the strategic oil reserves, and 
12
turned to foreign oil production, doing everything in its 
13
power to hamper domestic oil production. 
14
President Biden recently took a trip to Saudi Arabia 
15
where he continues to encourage members of the Organi-
16
zation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to expand 
17
output rather than promoting energy independence domes-
18
tically. 
19
The United States energy sector has repeatedly 
20
reached out to President Biden to show him the potential 
21
of United States energy production sites, with no reply 
22
from the White House.

•HRES 1362 IH 
President Biden’s decision to ignore United States 
1
domestic energy producers is a clear sign of his apathy 
2
towards the very people he is sworn to protect. 
3
Wherefore President Biden, by such conduct, has 
4
demonstrated that he will remain a threat to the United 
5
States’ national and energy security if allowed to remain 
6
in office, and has acted in a manner grossly incompatible 
7
with self-governance and the rule of law. 
8
President Biden thus warrants impeachment and 
9
trial, removal from office, and disqualification to hold and 
10
enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United 
11
States.
