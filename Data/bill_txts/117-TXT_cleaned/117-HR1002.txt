RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
Vice President Kamala Harris should be removed from 
her position as the head of the Biden administration’s

Whereas, on March 24, 2021, Vice President Kamala Harris 
was named ‘‘Border Czar’’ in charge of leading efforts to 
stem migration across the United States-Mexico border;

•HRES 1002 IH 
Whereas Vice President Harris has visited the southern bor-
der once since President Biden appointed her to lead ef-
forts to stem migration across the United States-Mexico 
border; 
Whereas border security is national security and the ongoing 
influx of migrants poses a significant threat to the public 
health and safety of our communities; 
Whereas, under the Biden administration, a historic number 
of illegal immigrants, violent criminals, and deadly drugs 
have flooded into our communities through the southern 
border; 
Whereas over two million migrants illegally crossed our 
southern border in the fiscal year 2021; 
Whereas U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) re-
ported a 1,066 percent increase in fentanyl seized at 
eight southern Texas ports during fiscal year 2021 under 
President Biden; 
Whereas the Biden administration has allowed for mass mi-
gration to the United States by allowing politics to cloud 
its judgment when assessing policies; 
Whereas our southern border is less safe now than it ever has 
been; and 
Whereas U.S. Customs and Border Protection is underfunded 
and lacks resources needed due to Vice President Har-
ris’s refusal to address the issues: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives urges

the Biden administration to—
