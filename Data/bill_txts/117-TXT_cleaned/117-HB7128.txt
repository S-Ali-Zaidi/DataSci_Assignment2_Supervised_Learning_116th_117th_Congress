SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The Financial Crimes Enforcement Net-
3
work (FinCEN) is the Financial Intelligence Unit of 
4
the United States tasked with safeguarding the fi-
5
nancial system from illicit use, combating money 
6
laundering and its related crimes including ter-
7
rorism, and promoting national security. 
8
(2) Per statute, FinCEN may require domestic 
9
financial institutions and financial agencies to take 
10
certain ‘‘special measures’’ against jurisdictions, in-
11
stitutions, classes of transactions, or types of ac-
12
counts determined to be of primary money laun-
13
dering concern, providing the Secretary with a range 
14
of options, such as enhanced record-keeping, that 
15
can be adapted to target specific money laundering 
16
and terrorist financing and to bring pressure on 
17
those that pose money laundering threats. 
18
(3) This special-measures authority was grant-
19
ed in 2001, when most cross-border transactions oc-
20
curred through correspondent or payable-through ac-
21
counts held with large financial institutions which 
22
serve as intermediaries to facilitate financial trans-
23
actions on behalf of other banks. 
24
(4) Innovations in financial services have trans-
25
formed and expanded methods of cross-border trans-
26

actions that could not have been envisioned 20 years 
1
ago when FinCEN was given its special-measures 
2
authority. 
3
(5) These innovations, particularly through dig-
4
ital assets and informal value transfer systems, while 
5
useful to legitimate consumers and law enforcement, 
6
can be tools abused by bad actors like sanctions 
7
evaders, fraudsters, money launderers, and those 
8
who commit ransomware attacks on victimized U.S. 
9
companies and which abuse the financial system to 
10
move and obscure the proceeds of their crimes. 
11
(6) Ransomware attacks on U.S. companies re-
12
quiring payments in cryptocurrencies have increased 
13
in recent years, with the U.S. Treasury estimating 
14
that ransomware payments in the United States 
15
reached $590 million in just the first half of 2021, 
16
compared to a total of $416 million in 2020. 
17
(7) In July 2021, the White House, with sup-
18
port of U.S. allies, asserted that the People’s Repub-
19
lic of China was responsible for ransomware oper-
20
ations against private companies that included de-
21
mands of millions of dollars, including the 2021 
22
ransomware attacks that breached Microsoft email 
23
systems and affected thousands of consumers, State 
24
and local municipalities, and government contractors

attributed to a cyber espionage group with links to 
1
the Chinese Ministry of State Security. 
2
(8) As ransomware attacks organized by Chi-
3
nese and other foreign bad actors continue to grow 
4
in size and scope, modernizing FinCEN’s special 
5
measure authorities will empower FinCEN to adapt 
6
its existing tools, monitor and obstruct global finan-
7
cial threats, and meet the challenges of combating 
8
21st century financial crime.
