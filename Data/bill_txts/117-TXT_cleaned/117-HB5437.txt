SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
The Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The U.S. Air Force is an essential and inte-
3
gral part U.S. national security and diplomatic ef-
4
forts, often called upon to enter extremely dangerous 
5
situations and provide support and safety for combat 
6
and non-combat missions worldwide. 
7
(2) A U.S. Air Force C–17 Globemaster III air-
8
crew, assigned to the 6th Airlift Squadron, 305 Air 
9
Mobility Wing, based at Joint Base McGuire-Dix- 
10
Lakehurst (JBMDL), callsign Reach 871, was de-
11
ployed to Afghanistan in support of Operation Allies 
12
Refuge to assist in non-combatant evacuation oper-
13
ations. 
14
(3) Reach 871 safely evacuated over 800 Af-
15
ghans fleeing the Taliban takeover of Kabul. 
16
(4) U.S. Air Force confirmed that Reach 871’s 
17
evacuation flight set a record for the number of per-

those civilian lives and safety above all else.
