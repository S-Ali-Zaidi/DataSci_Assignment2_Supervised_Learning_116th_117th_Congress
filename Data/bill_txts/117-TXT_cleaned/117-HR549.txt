RESOLUTION 
Condemning the assassination of the Haitian President, and 
urging United States and global support of Haitian- 
led solutions. 
Whereas, on July 7, 2021, Haitian President Jovenel Moise 
was assassinated, and his wife was critically wounded at 
their home in Port-au-Prince; 
Whereas, prior to this heinous attack, Haiti was already 
mired in a series of crises, including growing political un-
rest, poverty, and a threefold increase in kidnappings; 
Whereas Haiti has long been one of the most vulnerable na-
tions in the Western Hemisphere; 
Whereas over 1,000,000 persons of Haitian descent live 
throughout the United States;

Whereas Haiti’s stability has significant economic and secu-
rity implications for the United States and the region; 
Whereas the close proximity of Haiti to the shores of the 
United States, in conjunction with the common bond of 
mutual values and commitment to democracy, ensures 
lasting comity of nations and continued trade and diplo-
matic relations; and 
Whereas Haiti, the only republic to rise from a successful 
slave rebellion, inspires pride, solidarity, and self-reliance: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) joins with President Biden in extending the 
2
condolences of the American people to the people of 
3
Haiti, First Lady Martine Moise, and the Moise 
4
family on the tragic loss of President Jovenel Moise; 
5
(2) condemns, in the strongest terms, the assas-
6
sination of Haitian President Jovenel Moise on July 
7
7, 2021, and supports United States contributions

9
to bring the persons responsible to justice;

11
ical actors and civil society to conduct free and fair 
12
elections and charter a path back to democratic rule;

14
ernment to engage Haitian civil society and not rush
