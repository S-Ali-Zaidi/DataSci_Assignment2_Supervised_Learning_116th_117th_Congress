Whereas malnutrition can be driven by social determinants of 
health, including poverty or economic instability, access 
to affordable health care, and low health literacy; 
Whereas there are inextricable and cyclical links between pov-
erty and malnutrition; 
Whereas the Department of Agriculture defines food insecu-
rity as when a person or household does not have regular, 
reliable access to the foods needed for good health; 
Whereas communities of color, across all age groups, are dis-
proportionately likely to experience both food insecurity 
and malnutrition;

in a food-insecure household than White children; 
Whereas infants, older adults, people with chronic diseases, 
and other vulnerable populations are particularly at risk 
for malnutrition; 
Whereas the American Academy of Pediatrics has found that 
failure to provide key nutrients during early childhood 
may result in lifelong deficits in brain function; 
Whereas disease-associated malnutrition affects between 30 
and 50 percent of patients admitted to hospitals, and the 
medical costs of hospitalized patients with malnutrition 
can be 300 percent more than the medical costs of prop-
erly nourished patients; 
Whereas, according to the ‘‘National Blueprint: Achieving 
Quality Malnutrition Care for Older Adults, 2020 Up-
date’’, as many as half of older adults living in the

cent of older adults receiving meals at senior centers and 
other congregate facilities report improved health out-
comes, and 84 percent of older adults receiving home-de-
livered meals indicate the same; 
Whereas disease-associated malnutrition in older adults alone 
costs the United States more than $51,300,000,000 each 
year; and
