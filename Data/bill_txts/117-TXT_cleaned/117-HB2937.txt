SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Rail Passenger Fair-
2
ness Act’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
(1) Congress created Amtrak under the Rail 
5
Passenger Service Act of 1970 (Public Law 91– 
6
158). 
7
(2) Amtrak began serving customers on May 1, 
8
1971, taking over the operation of most intercity 
9
passenger trains that private, freight railroads were 
10
previously required to operate. In exchange for as-
11
suming these passenger rail operations, Amtrak was 
12
given access to the national rail network. 
13
(3) In return for relief from the obligation to 
14
provide intercity passenger service, railroads over 
15
which Amtrak operated (referred to in this section 
16
as ‘‘host railroads’’) were expected to give Amtrak 
17
passenger trains preference over freight trains when 
18
using the national rail network. 
19
(4) In 1973, Congress passed the Amtrak Im-
20
provement Act of 1973 (Public Law 93–146), which 
21
gives intercity and commuter rail passenger trans-
22
portation preference over freight transportation in 
23
using a rail line, junction, or crossing. This right, 
24
which is now codified as section 24308(c) of title 49, 
25
United States Code, states, ‘‘Except in an emer-
26

•HR 2937 IH
gency, intercity and commuter rail passenger trans-
1
portation provided by or for Amtrak has preference 
2
over freight transportation in using a rail line, junc-
3
tion, or crossing unless the Board orders otherwise 
4
under this subsection. A rail carrier affected by this 
5
subsection may apply to the Board for relief. If the 
6
Board, after an opportunity for a hearing under sec-
7
tion 553 of title 5, decides that preference for inter-
8
city and commuter rail passenger transportation ma-
9
terially will lessen the quality of freight transpor-
10
tation provided to shippers, the Board shall establish 
11
the rights of the carrier and Amtrak on reasonable 
12
terms.’’. 
13
(5) Many host railroads have ignored the law 
14
referred to in paragraph (4) by refusing to give pas-
15
senger rail the priority to which it is statutorily enti-
16
tled and giving freight transportation the higher pri-
17
ority. As a result, Amtrak’s on time performance on 
18
most host railroads is poor, has declined between 
19
2014 through 2019, and continues to decline. 
20
(6) According to Amtrak, 6,500,000 customers 
21
on State-supported and long-distance trains arrived 
22
at their destination late during fiscal year 2019. 
23
Nearly 70 percent of these delays were caused by 
24
host railroads, amounting to a total of 3,200,000 
25

minutes. The largest cause of these delays was 
1
freight train interference, which accounted for more 
2
than 1,000,000 minutes of delay for Amtrak pas-
3
sengers, or approximately 2 years, because host rail-
4
roads chose to give freight trains priority. 
5
(7) Poor on-time performance wastes taxpayer 
6
dollars. According to a 2019 report by Amtrak’s Of-
7
fice of Inspector General, a 5 percent improvement 
8
of on-time performance on all Amtrak routes would 
9
result in $12,100,000 in cost savings to Amtrak in 
10
the first year. If on-time performance on long-dis-
11
tance routes reached 75 percent for a year, Amtrak 
12
would realize an estimated $41,900,000 in operating 
13
cost 
savings, 
with 
a 
one-time 
savings 
of 
14
$336,000,000 due to a reduction in equipment re-
15
placement needs. 
16
(8) Historical data suggests that on-time per-
17
formance on host railroads is driven by the existence 
18
of an effective means to enforce Amtrak’s preference 
19
rights: 
20
(A) Two months after the date of the en-
21
actment of the Passenger Rail Investment and 
22
Improvement Act of 2008 (division B of Public 
23
Law 110–432), which included provisions for 
24
the enforcement of these preference rights, was 
25

•HR 2937 IH
enacted, the on-time performance of long-dis-
1
tance trains improved from 56 percent to 77 
2
percent and Class I freight train interference 
3
delays across all routes declined by 40 percent. 
4
(B) One year after such date of enactment, 
5
freight train interference delays had declined by 
6
54 percent and the on-time performance of 
7
long-distance trains reached 85 percent. 
8
(C) In 2014, after some of the provisions 
9
in the Passenger Rail Investment and Improve-
10
ment Act of 2008 related to enforcement of 
11
preference were ruled unconstitutional by a 
12
D.C. Circuit Court, long-distance train on-time 
13
performance declined from 72 percent to 50 
14
percent, and freight train interference delays in-
15
creased 59 percent. 
16
(D) The last time long-distance trains 
17
achieved an on-time rate of more than 80 per-
18
cent in a given month was February 2012. 
19
(9) As a result of violations of Amtrak’s right 
20
to preference, Amtrak has been consistently unable 
21
on host railroad networks to meet its congressionally 
22
mandated mission and goals, which are codified in 
23
section 24101 of title 49, United States Code (relat-
24

•HR 2937 IH
ing to providing on-time and trip-time competitive 
1
service to its passengers). 
2
(10) Amtrak does not have an effective mecha-
3
nism to enforce its statutory preference right in 
4
order to fulfill its mission and goals. Only the Attor-
5
ney General can bring a civil action for equitable re-
6
lief in a district court of the United States to en-
7
force Amtrak’s preference rights. 
8
(11) In Amtrak’s entire history, the only en-
9
forcement action initiated by the Attorney General 
10
was against the Southern Pacific Transportation 
11
Company in 1979. 
12
(12) Congress supports continued authority for 
13
the Attorney General to initiate an action, but Am-
14
trak should also be entitled to bring a civil action be-
15
fore a Federal district court to enforce its statutory 
16
preference rights.
