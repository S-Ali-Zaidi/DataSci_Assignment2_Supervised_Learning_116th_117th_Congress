alter the standard operation of the Federal Rules of 
16
Criminal Procedure, or the Federal Rules of Evi-
17
dence, as such rules would function in the absence 
18
of an evidentiary privilege.

(c) REQUIREMENTS FOR FEDERAL USE OF FOREN-
20
SIC ALGORITHMS.—Any Federal law enforcement agency 
21

1
duct an internal validation according to the requirements 
2
outlined in the Computational Forensic Algorithm Testing 
3
Standards and make the results publicly available. The in-
4
ternal validation shall be updated when there is a material 
5
change in the software that triggers a retesting by the 
6
Computational Forensic Algorithm Testing Program. 
7
(d) TESTING PROGRAM.—The Director of the Na-
8
tional Institute of Standards and Technology shall estab-
9
lish a Computational Forensic Algorithm Testing Pro-
10
gram, whose activities include the following: 
11
(1) Testing individual software programs using 
12
the testing requirements established in the Computa-
13
tional Forensic Algorithm Testing Standards. 
14
(2) Using realistic sample testing data similar 
15
to what would be used by law enforcement in crimi-
16
nal investigations in performing such testing, includ-
17
ing incomplete and contaminated samples. 
18
(3) Using testing data that represents diversity 
19
of racial, ethnic, and gender identities and intersec-
20
tions of these identities in performing such testing. 
21
(4) Using testing data that tests the limits of 
22
the software and demonstrates the boundaries of re-
23
