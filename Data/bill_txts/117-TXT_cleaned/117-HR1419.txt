RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the roles and the contributions of United States 
certified nurse-midwives and certified midwives in pro-
viding high-quality, evidence-based, and cost-effective 
health care services to women and childbearing families. 
Whereas certified nurse-midwives (CNMs) and certified mid-
wives (CMs) are essential to the United States maternal 
health care system, providing a wide-range of health care 
services for women and childbearing families, including 
the independent provision of primary care, gynecologic 
services, preconception care, care during pregnancy, 
childbirth and the postpartum period, and care of the un-
complicated newborn during the first 28 days of life;

approximately 10 percent of our Nation’s births annually 
and serve as frontline essential health care providers; 
Whereas midwifery-led care is evidence-based and has been 
shown to reduce maternal and neonatal mortality, rates 
of stillbirth, perineal trauma, instrumental births, 
intrapartum analgesia use, rates of severe blood loss, 
preterm birth, low birth weight, and neonatal hypo-
thermia, and has been associated with more efficient use 
of resources and improved outcomes including increased 
rates 
of 
spontaneous 
labor, 
vaginal 
birth, 
and 
breastfeeding; 
Whereas women and childbearing families who receive mid-
wifery-led care have higher rates of satisfaction, pain re-
lief in labor, and supported maternal-newborn inter-
action; 
Whereas CNMs and CMs play an integral role in improving 
health outcomes in all communities; 
Whereas midwifery-led care is a significant source of mater-
nal health services in rural, underserved and low- 
resourced and vulnerable communities, and CNMs and 
CMs attend over 30 percent of deliveries in rural hos-
pitals; 
Whereas CNMs and CMs provide care in every setting in 
which maternal and women’s health care services are de-
livered, including hospitals, private office practices, public 
health departments, community health centers, rural 
health centers, the Armed Forces, the Veterans Health 
Administration, the Indian Health Service, freestanding 
birth centers, and in the home setting; and 
Whereas since 1988, National Midwifery Week has been cele-
brated during the last week of September or the first
