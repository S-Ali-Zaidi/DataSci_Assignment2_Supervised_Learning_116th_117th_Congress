SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
1
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) In April 2012, six miners assigned to clear 
3
bat guano from the Mojiang coal mine in Mojiang, 
4
Yunnan, China fell ill and 3 of them died. A team 
5
of scientists from the Wuhan Institute of Virology 
6
were called in to take samples of bats and found 
7
multiple new coronaviruses. 
8
(2) Scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Virol-
9
ogy did not announce the existence of the new 
10
coronaviruses nor their connections to the coal mine 
11
and the miners that became ill until 2021. 
12
(3) Dr. Shi Zhengli, lead scientist at Wuhan In-
13
stitute of Virology, described experiments to World 
14
Health Organization (WHO) scientists that could be 
15
described as gain of function research. These experi-
16
ments included manipulating certain spike proteins 
17
from coronaviruses found in bats and making them 
18
capable of infecting human cells. 
19
(4) The Wuhan Institute of Virology has been 
20
conducting experiments on a coronavirus identified 
21
as RaTG13, which was among the viruses found in 
22
the Mojiang mineshaft. 
23
(5) The Wuhan Institute of Virology has identi-
24
fied RaTG13 to be the most similar to SARS–CoV– 
25

•HR 4080 IH
2, the virus that causes COVID–19 with a 96.2 per-
1
cent similarity. 
2
(6) In November 2019 three scientists at the 
3
Wuhan Institute of Virology became ill ‘‘with symp-
4
toms consistent with both COVID–19 and common 
5
seasonal illness’’. All 3 scientists sought treatment 
6
at a hospital. 
7
(7) A lab leak would not be unprecedented in 
8
China. In 2004, a SARS outbreak stemming from 2 
9
scientists at the Chinese Institute of Virology in Bei-
10
jing infected 9 people and killed one. 
11
(8) China refused to allow scientists to inves-
12
tigate the potential origins of COVID–19 until Jan-
13
uary 2021, more than a year after COVID–19 began 
14
its spread. 
15
(9) China only agreed to a WHO investigation 
16
if it had veto power over the scientists chosen for the 
17
trip and privilege to review and edit the final report 
18
before release. Thirty to sixty members of the Chi-
19
nese participants were not scientists. 
20
(10) China would not allow the international 
21
team access to blood bank samples, raw data of any 
22
kind, lab logs, lab biosafety requirements, or to 
23
interview staff members.

(11) The WHO team was required to remain 
1
separate from Chinese scientists unless in approved 
2
settings and were allowed only 3 hours inside the 
3
Wuhan lab under strict conditions. 
4
(12) Chinese scientists examined the medical 
5
records of 76,000 people in a province of nearly 60 
6
million people. Of that 76,000, only 92 were chosen 
7
to be tested for COVID–19 antibodies long after 
8
they could have faded and without any explanation 
9
to the WHO team of the criterion in which they 
10
were chosen. 
11
(13) The COVID–19 pandemic, whether natu-
12
rally occurring or not, was made worse due to the 
13
lies and misinformation promulgated by the Chinese 
14
Communist Party (CCP). 
15
(14) On January 3, 2020, China’s National 
16
Health Commission ordered medical institutions and 
17
labs not to publish any information about the new 
18
virus without specific government approval. The no-
19
tice also ordered labs to destroy their samples or 
20
send them to other designated institutions. 
21
(15) Even after the CCP knowingly delayed no-
22
tifying the world of the COVID–19 virus and did not 
23
share the genome sequence until January 11, 2020, 
24
the WHO repeatedly defended them.

•HR 4080 IH
(16) For weeks after various physicians in 
1
Wuhan warned of the possibility of human-to-human 
2
transmission, China refused to admit any such cases 
3
existed, as reported by the BBC. 
4
(17) Dr. Li Wenliang and eight other doctors 
5
warned of the dangers of the new virus in December 
6
2019. 
7
(18) In January 2020, the doctors were sum-
8
moned by the Public Security Bureau and silenced. 
9
(19) On January 14, 2020, the WHO tweeted 
10
‘‘preliminary investigations conducted by China have 
11
found no clear evidence of human-to-human trans-
12
mission’’. 
13
(20) On January 30, 2020, the WHO finally 
14
declares the outbreak to be a global health emer-
15
gency. 
16
(21) On February 24, 2020, following a 9-day 
17
field excursion in China, a joint team of CCP and 
18
WHO scientists held a news conference in which the 
19
WHO stated China’s actions slowed the spread of 
20
the epidemic and prevented or delayed thousands of 
21
cases. 
22
(22) On February 28, 2020, the joint team 
23
praised China for the ‘‘remarkable speed’’ of their 
24
response in isolating the virus. 
25
23:28 Jul 16, 2021

•HR 4080 IH
(23) Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the 
1
WHO’s director-general, visited China and praised 
2
the country’s leadership for ‘‘setting a new standard 
3
for outbreak response’’. Another month and a half 
4
went by before the WHO called COVID–19 a pan-
5
demic, at which point the virus had killed more than 
6
4,000 people and had infected 118,000 people across 
7
nearly every continent. 
8
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
9
gress that the People’s Republic of China and the CCP 
10
are fully responsible and liable for all deaths, injuries, and 
11
financial losses suffered in the United States by reason 
12
of the spread of COVID–19.
