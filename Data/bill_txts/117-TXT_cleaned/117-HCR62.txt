Whereas COVID–19 has affirmed the dedication of public 
health professionals, including environmental health pro-
fessionals, epidemiologists, public health nurses, health 
educators, mental health professionals, microbiologists, 
and many other critical professionals; 
Whereas the dedicated individuals who work to advance the 
public health play an instrumental role in lessening the 
burden of disease through research, surveillance and 
monitoring, education, and prevention by developing 
strategies, tools, policies, and programs, and in so doing 
are essential to improving quality of life and extending 
life expectancy; 
Whereas public health professionals have continuously shown 
their value in reducing and abating health and environ-
mental threats such as influenza, tracing and addressing 
food-borne illnesses and other disease outbreaks, and pro-
moting wellness by encouraging healthy behaviors; 
Whereas almost half a million Americans die each year from 
smoking, and more than 1,000 cases of acute vaping-re-
lated disease have been documented across the country 
since June 2019; 
Whereas poor air quality, poor water quality, inadequate 
sanitation, social determinants, and behavioral factors ex-
acerbate disease; 
Whereas, as of November 1, 2021, COVID–19, a global pan-
demic, has claimed the lives of more than 745,535 Amer-
icans and 5,000,000 individuals across the globe; 
Whereas public health professionals continue to tirelessly 
serve as a first line of defense against COVID–19;

•HCON 62 IH 
Whereas first responders who put themselves in harm’s way 
to protect and defend the public health are an imperative 
resource to the United States and its citizens; 
Whereas public health professionals are devoted to preventing 
other infectious diseases from spreading and to reducing 
the impact of the spectrum of longstanding and emerging 
global health threats in order to forestall and minimize 
the damage of future outbreaks; 
Whereas public health professionals play a critical role in 
combating opioid addiction and opioid-related overdose 
deaths, which are devastating communities across the 
Nation, an epidemic concurrent with the COVID–19 pan-
demic; 
Whereas public health professionals are pivotal to combating 
antimicrobial resistance, which affects 2,800,000 people 
in the United States and leads to the deaths of at least 
35,000 Americans and 700,000 individuals globally each 
year; 
Whereas public health professionals play a central role in re-
ducing racial, ethnic, and geographical disparities in 
health and health care that erode the Nation’s strength, 
prosperity, and productivity; 
Whereas COVID–19 has intensified health disparities, dis-
proportionately affecting communities of color and cre-
ating acute health care challenges in rural areas of the 
Nation; and 
Whereas public health professionals are among the heroic 
first responders who confront and work to prevent nat-
ural disasters and environmental hazards that present a 
persistent threat to the life, health, and safety of all indi-
viduals in the United States: Now, therefore, be it
