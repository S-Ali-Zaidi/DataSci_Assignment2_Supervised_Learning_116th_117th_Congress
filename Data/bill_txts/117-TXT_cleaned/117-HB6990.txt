Congress finds the following:

•HR 6990 IH
(1) Doris Miller, like other African-American 
1
sailors of his day, was generally relegated to service- 
2
based roles on ships, as the Navy did not allow sail-
3
ors of color to enlist in combat roles. 
4
(2) On December 7, 1941, Doris Miller was 
5
serving aboard the USS West Virginia in Hawaii 
6
when Japanese torpedo bombers attacked his ship 
7
and others at the Pearl Harbor Naval Base—head-
8
quarters of the U.S. Pacific Fleet. During this infa-
9
mous attack, Doris Miller manned a gun magazine 
10
amidships. When a torpedo damaged the magazine, 
11
Doris Miller helped carry the wounded to safety, in-
12
cluding his ship’s commander, Captain Mervyn S. 
13
Bennion. Doris Miller then manned a .50 caliber 
14
antiaircraft gun, for which he had no training, and 
15
continued firing on the enemy until he ran out of 
16
ammunition and received the order to abandon ship. 
17
(3) Doris Miller was acknowledged in the USS 
18
West Virginia Action Report, individually, along 
19
with other brave personnel for having ‘‘carried out 
20
every order promptly and enthusiastically, even when 
21
it meant danger to themselves. They did not attempt 
22
to abandon the bridge until ordered to do so.’’. 
23
(4) Doris Miller aided other service members 
24
and ‘‘was instrumental in hauling people along 
25

through oil and water to the quarterdeck, thereby 
1
unquestionably saving the lives of a number of peo-
2
ple who might otherwise have been lost.’’. 
3
(5) On December 15, 1941, the Navy released 
4
its commendations for actions in Pearl Harbor 
5
which included one ‘‘unnamed Negro’’. It wasn’t 
6
until March of 1942, at the behest of the NAACP, 
7
that the Navy formally recognized Miller’s heroism. 
8
(6) Doris Miller was recognized by the Navy 
9
and awarded the Navy Cross Medal with the citation 
10
reading ‘‘For distinguished devotion to duty, ex-
11
traordinary courage and disregard for his own per-
12
sonal safety during the attack on the Fleet in Pearl 
13
Harbor, Territory of Hawaii, by Japanese forces on 
14
December 7, 1941. While at the side of his Captain 
15
on the bridge, Miller, despite enemy strafing and 
16
bombing and in the face of a serious fire, assisted 
17
in moving his Captain, who had been mortally 
18
wounded, to a place of greater safety, and later 
19
manned and operated a machine gun directed at 
20
enemy Japanese attacking aircraft until ordered to 
21
leave the bridge.’’. 
22
(7) On May 27, 1942, Admiral Chester Nimitz 
23
personally pinned the Navy Cross to Miller’s left

(8) Doris Miller died in action on November 24, 
3
1943, on board the USS Liscome Bay in the Pacific 
4
Ocean after a single Japanese torpedo sank the ves-
5
sel off the coast of Butaritari Island.
