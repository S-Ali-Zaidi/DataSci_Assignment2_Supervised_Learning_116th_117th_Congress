19
(a) CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND DECLARATION 
20
OF PURPOSES.— 
21
(1) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
22
(A) In 1984, the Drug Price Competition 
23
and Patent Term Restoration Act (Public Law 
24
98–417) (referred to in this Act as the ‘‘1984 
25
05:34 Oct 02, 2021
H5260
228 
•HR 5260 IH
Act’’), was enacted with the intent of facili-
1
tating the early entry of generic drugs while 
2
preserving incentives for innovation. 
3
(B) Prescription drugs make up approxi-
4
mately 10 percent of the national health care 
5
spending. 
6
(C) Initially, the 1984 Act was successful 
7
in facilitating generic competition to the benefit 
8
of consumers and health care payers, although 
9
88 percent of all prescriptions dispensed in the 
10
United States are generic drugs, they account 
11
for only 28 percent of all expenditures. 
12
(D) Generic drugs cost substantially less 
13
than brand name drugs, with discounts off the 
14
brand price averaging 80 to 85 percent. 
15
(E) Federal dollars currently account for 
16
over 40 percent of the $325,000,000,000 spent 
17
on retail prescription drugs, and this share is 
18
expected to rise to 47 percent by 2025. 
19
(F)(i) In recent years, the intent of the 
20
1984 Act has been subverted by certain settle-
21
ment agreements in which brand name compa-
22
nies transfer value to their potential generic 
23
competitors to settle claims that the generic 
24
05:34 Oct 02, 2021
H5260
229 
•HR 5260 IH
company is infringing the branded company’s 
1
patents. 
2
(ii) These ‘‘reverse payment’’ settlement 
3
agreements— 
4
(I) allow a branded company to share 
5
its monopoly profits with the generic com-
6
pany as a way to protect the branded com-
7
pany’s monopoly; and 
8
(II) have unduly delayed the mar-
9
keting of low-cost generic drugs contrary 
10
to free competition, the interests of con-
11
sumers, and the principles underlying anti-
12
trust law. 
13
(iii) Because of the price disparity between 
14
brand name and generic drugs, such agree-
15
ments are more profitable for both the brand 
16
and generic manufacturers than competition 
17
and will become increasingly common unless 
18
prohibited. 
19
(iv) These agreements result in consumers 
20
losing the benefits that the 1984 Act was in-
21
tended to provide. 
22
(G) In 2010, the Biologics Price Competi-
23
tion and Innovation Act (Public Law 111–148) 
24
(referred to in this Act as the ‘‘BPCIA’’), was 
25

•HR 5260 IH
enacted with the intent of facilitating the early 
1
entry of biosimilar and interchangeable follow- 
2
on versions of branded biological products while 
3
preserving incentives for innovation. 
4
(H) Biological drugs play an important 
5
role in treating many serious illnesses, from 
6
cancers to genetic disorders. They are also ex-
7
pensive, representing more than 40 percent of 
8
all prescription drug spending. 
9
(I) Competition from biosimilar and inter-
10
changeable biological products promises to 
11
lower drug costs and increase patient access to 
12
biological medicines. But ‘‘reverse payment’’ 
13
settlement agreements also threaten to delay 
14
the entry of biosimilar and interchangeable bio-
15
logical products, which would undermine the 
16
goals of BPCIA. 
17
(2) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this Act 
18
are— 
19
(A) to enhance competition in the pharma-
20
ceutical market by stopping anticompetitive 
21
agreements between brand name and generic 
22
drug and biosimilar biological product manufac-
23
turers that limit, delay, or otherwise prevent

•HR 5260 IH
competition from generic drugs and biosimilar 
1
biological products; and 
2
(B) to support the purpose and intent of 
3
antitrust law by prohibiting anticompetitive 
4
practices in the pharmaceutical industry that 
5
harm consumers.

(b) UNLAWFUL COMPENSATION FOR DELAY.— 
7
(1) IN GENERAL.—The Federal Trade Commis-
8
sion Act (15 U.S.C. 44 et seq.) is amended by in-
9
serting after section 26 (15 U.S.C. 57c–2) the fol-
