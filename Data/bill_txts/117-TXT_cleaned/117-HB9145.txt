SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress makes the following findings: 
2
(1) To prepare students for success in the mod-
3
ern global economy, opportunities for study abroad 
4
should be included as part of a well-rounded edu-
5
cation. 
6
(2) Study abroad programs provide students 
7
with unparalleled access to international knowledge, 
8
an unmatched opportunity to learn foreign lan-
9
guages, and a unique environment for developing 
10
cultural understanding, all of which are knowledge 
11
and skills needed in today’s global economy. 
12
(3) Because only 10 percent of United States 
13
college students study abroad before they graduate, 
14
meaning that 90 percent of graduates are entering 
15
the workforce without the global skills, knowledge, 
16
and experiences afforded by study abroad programs 
17
that will position them for success in the global 
18
economy. Minority students, first generation college 
19
students, community college students, and students 
20
with disabilities are also significantly underrep-
21
resented in study abroad participation. 
22
(4) Congress authorized the establishment of 
23
the Commission on the Abraham Lincoln Study 
24
Abroad Fellowship Program pursuant to section 104 
25
of the Miscellaneous Appropriations and Offsets Act,

•HR 9145 IH
2004 (division H of Public Law 108–199). Pursuant 
1
to its mandate, the Lincoln Commission submitted 
2
to Congress and the President a report of its rec-
3
ommendations for greatly expanding the opportunity 
4
for students at institutions of higher education in 
5
the United States to study abroad, with special em-
6
phasis on studying in developing nations. 
7
(5) According to the Lincoln Commission, 
8
‘‘[e]xperience shows that leadership from adminis-
9
trators and faculty will drive the number of study 
10
abroad participants higher and improve the quality 
11
of programs. Such leadership is the only way that 
12
study abroad will become an integral part of the un-
13
dergraduate experience.’’. A competitive grant pro-
14
gram is necessary to encourage and support such 
15
leadership. 
16
(6) Student health, safety, and security while 
17
studying abroad is and must continue to be a pri-
18
ority for institutions of higher education and study 
19
abroad programs. 
20
(7) The COVID–19 pandemic has limited or 
21
prevented students from participating in study 
22
abroad due to travel restrictions and reduced budg-
23
ets. In a post-pandemic world, increasing access to 
24
study abroad for students at institutions of higher

education across the United States will be critical to 
1
ensuring that those students gain the skills, knowl-
2
edge, and experiences necessary to maintain the 
3
leadership of the United States in tackling global 
4
challenges, like pandemics, and succeeding in a glob-
5
al economy. 
6
SEC. 3. PURPOSES. 
7
The purposes of this Act are— 
8
(1) to ensure that significantly more students 
9
have access to quality study abroad opportunities; 
10
(2) to ensure that the diversity of students 
11
studying abroad reflects the diversity of students 
12
and institutions of higher education in the United 
13
States; 
14
(3) to encourage greater diversity in study 
15
abroad destinations by increasing the portion of 
16
study abroad that takes place in nontraditional 
17
study abroad destinations, especially in developing 
18
countries; and 
19
(4) to encourage a greater commitment by in-
20
stitutions of higher education to expand study 
21
abroad opportunities.
