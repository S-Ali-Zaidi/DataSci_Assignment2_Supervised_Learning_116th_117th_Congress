Whereas individuals of color are at a higher risk of being un-
insured than non-Hispanic White individuals; 
Whereas 73.7 percent of uninsured adults said that they were 
uninsured because the cost of coverage was too high; 
Whereas in the first half of 2020, 43.4 percent of adults were 
inadequately insured, which meant they were either unin-
sured, were insured but had experienced a coverage gap 
in the last year, or were insured but had such high costs 
relative to their income that they were effectively under-
insured; 
Whereas 4,000,000 uninsured people could have health care 
if the Medicaid expansion was adopted by the 12 remain-
ing States; 
Whereas there are approximately 12,100,000 uninsured peo-
ple who are potential marketplace shoppers, but are not 
enrolled in health care; 
Whereas every person in the United States has health care 
issues of his or her own or knows someone who needs 
health care in some form, and the need for care in in-
stances of disability, illness, or injury is universal and 
nonpartisan; 
Whereas the COVID–19 pandemic caused many individuals 
to be more cognizant of the need for health care; 
Whereas there is no month dedicated to educating Americans 
on all the ways health care affects our national commu-
nity and each individual life, including social deter-
minants of health care and health care equity, and how 
to advocate for improvements to health care; 
Whereas Congress constantly considers legislation related to 
health issues;
