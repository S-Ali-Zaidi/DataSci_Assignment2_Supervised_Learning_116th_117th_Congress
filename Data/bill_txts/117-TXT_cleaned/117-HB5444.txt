(1) assimilation processes, such as the Indian 
1
Boarding School Policies, were adopted by the 
2
United States Government to strip American Indian, 
3
Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian children of 
4
their Indigenous identities, beliefs, and languages to 
5
assimilate them into non-Native culture through fed-
6
erally funded and controlled Christian-run schools, 
7
which had the intent and, in many cases, the effect, 
8
of termination, with dire and intentional con-
9
sequences on the cultures and languages of Indige-
10
nous peoples; 
11
(2) assimilation processes can be traced back 
12
to— 
13
(A) the enactment of the Act of March 3, 
14
1819 (3 Stat. 516, chapter 85) (commonly 
15
known as the ‘‘Indian Civilization Fund Act of 
16
1819’’), which created a fund to administer the 
17
education, healthcare, and rations promised to 
18
Tribal nations under treaties those Tribal na-
19
tions had with the United States; and 
20
(B) the Grant Administration’s peace pol-
21
icy with Tribal nations in 1868, which, among 
22
other things, authorized amounts in the fund 
23
established under the Act of March 3, 1819 (3

‘‘Indian Civilization Fund Act of 1819’’), to be 
1
used by churches; 
2
(3) according to research from the National 
3
Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition, 
4
the Federal Government funded church-run boarding 
5
schools for Native Americans from 1819 through the 
6
1960s under the Act of March 3, 1819 (3 Stat. 516, 
7
chapter 85), which authorized the forced removal of 
8
hundreds of thousands of American Indian and 
9
Alaska Native children as young as 3 years old, relo-
10
cating them from their traditional homelands to 1 of 
11
at least 367 known Indian boarding schools, of 
12
which 73 remain open today, across 30 States; 
13
(4) beginning in 1820, missionaries from the 
14
United States arrived in Hawai‘i, bringing a similar 
15
desire to civilize Native Hawaiians and convert ‘‘Ha-
16
waiian heathens’’ to Christians, establishing day 
17
schools and boarding schools that followed models 
18
first imposed on Tribal nations on the East Coast of 
19
the United States; 
20
(5) as estimated by David Wallace Adams, pro-
21
fessor emeritus of history and education at Cleve-
22
land State University in Ohio, by 1926, nearly 83 
23
percent of American Indian and Alaska Native 
24
school-age children were enrolled in Indian boarding

schools in the United States, but, the full extent of 
1
the Indian Boarding School Policies has yet to be 
2
fully examined by— 
3
(A) the Federal Government or the church-
4
es who ran those schools; or 
5
(B) other entities who profited from the 
6
existence of those schools; 
7
(6) General Richard Henry Pratt, the founder 
8
and superintendent of the Carlisle Indian Industrial 
9
School in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, stated that the 
10
ethos of Indian Boarding School Policies was to ‘‘kill 
11
the Indian in him, and save the man’’; 
12
(7) in 1878, General Pratt brought a group of 
13
American Indian warriors held as prisoners of war 
14
to what was then known as the Hampton Agricul-
15
tural and Industrial School in Hampton, Virginia, 
16
for a residential experiment in the education of In-
17
digenous people; 
18
(8) prior to arriving to the Hampton Agricul-
19
tural and Industrial School in 1878, the American 
20
Indian warriors held as prisoners of war had already 
21
spent 3 years imprisoned, during which time they 
22
were forced to shave their traditionally grown hair, 
23
dress in military uniforms, participate in Christian 
24
worship services, and adopt an English name;

(9) General Samuel C. Armstrong, founder and, 
1
in 1878, principal, of the Hampton Agricultural and 
2
Industrial School, was influenced by his parents and 
3
other missionaries in the United States involved in 
4
the education of Native Hawaiian children; 
5
(10) General Armstrong modeled the Hampton 
6
Agricultural and Industrial School after the Hilo 
7
Boarding School in Hawai‘i, a missionary-run board-
8
ing school that targeted high performing Native Ha-
9
waiians to become indoctrinated in Protestant ide-
10
ology, which was similar to boarding schools led by 
11
missionaries in the similarly sovereign Five Tribes of 
12
Oklahoma, including the Cherokee and Chickasaw; 
13
(11) in addition to bringing a group of Amer-
14
ican Indian warriors held as prisoners of war to the 
15
Hampton Agricultural and Industrial School in 
16
1878, General Pratt influenced Sheldon Jackson, a 
17
Presbyterian missionary who, in 1885, was ap-
18
pointed by the Secretary of the Interior to be a Gen-
19
eral Agent of Education in the Alaska Territory; 
20

22
Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians until

(13) founded in 1879, the Carlisle Indian In-

3
the United States, where more than 10,000 Amer-
4
ican Indian and Alaska Native children were en-
5
rolled from more than 140 Indian Tribes; 
6
(14) Indian boarding schools, and the policies 
7
that created, funded, and fueled their existence, were 
8
designed to assimilate American Indian, Alaska Na-
9
tive, and Native Hawaiian children into non-Native 
10
culture by stripping them of their cultural identities, 
11
often through physical, sexual, psychological, indus-
12

(15) many of the children who were taken to 
14
Indian boarding schools did not survive, and of those 
15
who did survive, many never returned to their par-
