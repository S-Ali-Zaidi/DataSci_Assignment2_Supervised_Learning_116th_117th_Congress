RESOLUTION 
Condemning the inhumane treatment and human rights 
abuses toward women and girls in Afghanistan by 
Taliban forces through their strict interpretation of 
Sharia law. 
Whereas when the Taliban seized power in Afghanistan in 
1996, their interpretation of Sharia law facilitated several 
oppressive social, political, and religious freedoms against 
women and girls; 
Whereas, in 2001, the Taliban relinquished power in Afghani-
stan ensuring more rights for women were set to return; 
Whereas, in 2004, women were once again given the right to 
vote in elections, and girls and women joined the army 
and police forces, trained as surgeons and judges, and

worked as journalists among many other professions pre-
viously prohibited to them; 
Whereas, in 2009, the Elimination of Violence Against 
Women (EVAW) became law in Afghanistan facilitating 
a rise in holding those accountable for abuses against 
women, and shining a light on the atrocities plaguing 
women in the nation; 
Whereas the Elimination of Violence Against Women makes 
22 acts of abuse toward women criminal offenses, includ-
ing rape, battery, forced marriage, preventing women 
from owning property, and prohibiting women and girls 
from attending school or working; 
Whereas, despite progress made toward improving basic 
human rights for women and girls, many cases of rape, 
sexual abuse, strict dress codes, restrictions on women 
and girls’ movement, and the exchanging of girls and 
young women to settle disputes or repay debts continued 
in rural areas of Afghanistan; 
Whereas when the Taliban seized control on August 15, 
2021, they insisted nearly all women stay away from 
work until the security situation improves, and security 
issues were one of the reasons the Taliban gave when 
they controlled Afghanistan in the 1990s to prevent 
women from working; 
Whereas, on August 24, 2021, the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights ‘‘received credible re-
ports of serious violations of international human law, 
and human rights abuses taking place in many areas 
under effective Taliban control’’ including executions of 
civilians and members of the Afghan national security 
forces, restrictions on the rights of women and girls to

move around freely and attend schools, the recruitment 
of child soldiers, and repression of peaceful protest and 
expressions of dissent; 
Whereas though the Taliban stated the new Taliban govern-
ment was more progressive toward women’s rights, there 
was not a single woman in the new cabinet and Taliban 
officials announced women could only study at univer-
sities in gender-segregated classrooms while adhering to 
traditional, strict Islamic dress; 
Whereas, in early September 2021, women were marching 
peacefully chanting ‘‘we want equal rights, we want 
women in government’’ before the Taliban arrived and 
began beating the women with whips and batons emitting 
electric shocks; 
Whereas the Elimination of Violence Against Women law im-
plemented by the former democratic Government of Af-
ghanistan should remain intact to combat discriminatory 
and violent offenses against women and girls in Afghani-
stan; and 
Whereas a Taliban-dominated government under their inter-
pretation of Sharia law threatens international legal pro-
tections for the fundamental rights of Afghan women and 
girls, who play a vital role in civil society: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) condemns any actions taken by any terrorist 
2
organization or form of government in Afghanistan 
3
to oppress women and girls; 
4
(2) demands the Taliban regime preserve and
