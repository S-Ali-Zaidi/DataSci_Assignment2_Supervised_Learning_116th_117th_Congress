•HR 4112 IH
(1) The February 2015 report of the Bureau of 
1
Consumer Financial Protection titled ‘‘Consumer 
2
Voices on Credit Reports and Scores’’ found that 
3
some consumers are reluctant to comparison shop 
4
for loans and other types of consumer credit prod-
5
ucts out of fear that they will lower their credit 
6
scores by doing so. 
7
(2) The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protec-
8
tion found that one of the most common barriers for 
9
people in reviewing their own credit reports and 
10
shopping for the best credit terms was a lack of un-
11
derstanding of the differences between ‘‘soft’’ and 
12
‘‘hard’’ inquiries and whether requesting a copy of 
13
their own report would adversely impact their credit 
14
standing. 
15
(3) The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protec-
16
tion revealed that consumers with accurate percep-
17
tions of their creditworthiness may be better 
18
equipped to shop for favorable credit terms.
