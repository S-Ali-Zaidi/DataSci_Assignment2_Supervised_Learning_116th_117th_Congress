SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress find that— 
2
(1) as technology advances and vehicle systems 
3
become more advanced, vehicle repair and mainte-
4
nance will require access to extensive vehicle data, 
5
software, sophisticated replacement components, 
6
training, diagnostic tools and enhanced diagnostic 
7
repair services; 
8
(2) consumers and their designees must have 
9
access to vehicle-generated data and aftermarket 
10
parts that are necessary to maintain consumer 
11
choice and competitive pricing; 
12
(3) consumer choice, consumer control, motor 
13
vehicle cybersecurity, and safety are all valid con-
14
cerns and do not have to be mutually exclusive; 
15
(4) vehicles generate increasingly massive 
16
amounts of data and the Federal Trade Commission 
17
and the National Highway Traffic Safety Adminis-
18
tration are uniquely positioned, after considering 
19
consumers’ privacy and cybersecurity needs, to des-
20
ignate additional types of data not specifically con-
21
sidered or identified by Congress that consumers 
22
should be able to easily share with persons they 
23
choose for the reasons they choose and examine fair 
24
competition in evolving motor vehicle technologies; 
25
and

(5) it is in the interest of the United States to 
1
foster competition in the motor vehicle repair indus-

try and not limit consumers in their choices for
