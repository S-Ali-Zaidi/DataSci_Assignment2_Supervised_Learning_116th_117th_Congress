A BILL 
To encourage States to allow local governments to implement 
laws to reduce gun violence, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Local Public Health 
4
And Safety Protection Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) When it comes to gun violence, local laws 
8
serve the important purpose of addressing the 
9

•HR 4888 IH
unique issues and dangers facing each different com-
1
munity. 
2
(2) Most State constitutions generally allocate 
3
authority to local governments to regulate in the in-
4
terests of the public health, safety, and welfare. 
5
States that have removed authority from local gov-
6
ernments to regulate guns and ammunition have cre-
7
ated a dangerous exception to the traditional rule of 
8
local authority. 
9
(3) Broad State preemption statutes ignore im-
10
portant local variations that may necessitate distinct 
11
approaches to the problem of gun violence. State 
12
preemption statutes threaten public safety because 
13
they prevent local governments from implementing 
14
customized solutions to gun violence in their commu-
15
nities. 
16
(4) By mandating a one-size-fits-all approach to 
17
firearms regulation, preemption statutes deprive the 
18
public of a critical problem-solving resource—local 
19
innovation. Local governments are often the source 
20
of cutting-edge laws to reduce gun violence, which 
21
are proven successful and later adopted at the state-
22
wide level. 
23
(5) State preemption statutes impede local gov-
24
ernment’s ability to fill regulatory gaps created by 
25

•HR 4888 IH
inaction at the State and Federal level. Restrictions 
1
on State and Federal resources also make an extra 
2
level of local involvement necessary to properly en-
3
force many gun laws. For example, local law en-
4
forcement may provide much needed oversight of 
5
gun businesses, which the Bureau of Alcohol, To-
6
bacco, Firearms and Explosives is too underfunded 
7
to provide. 
8
(6) States should not prohibit or restrict a local 
9
government from imposing or implementing laws 
10
that are more restrictive than the laws of the rel-
11
evant State with respect to— 
12
(A) any background check requirement in 
13
relation to any firearm transaction; 
14
(B) the ability to carry a firearm in public 
15
places or in locations owned or controlled by a 
16
unit of local government; 
17
(C) any requirement relating to the sale of 
18
ammunition, such as a limitation on the 
19
amount an individual is allowed to purchase at 
20
one time; 
21
(D) any additional requirements relating to 
22
licensing or permitting the purchase of a fire-
23
arm; 
24

•HR 4888 IH
(E) any requirement that firearm owners 
1
safely store their firearms, or prevent children 
2
or any other unauthorized person from access-
3
ing their firearms; 
4
(F) taxes on the sale of firearms and am-
5
munition, unless the State prohibits or restricts 
6
local governments from imposing such taxes on 
7
most other consumer products; 
8
(G) the sale, transfer, or possession of spe-

cific types of unusually dangerous firearms and 
10
accessories, such as assault weapons, bump

stocks, and high capacity magazines;

(H) the discharge of firearms in public
