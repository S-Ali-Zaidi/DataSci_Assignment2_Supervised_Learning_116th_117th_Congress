A BILL 
To amend the Public Health Service Act to prohibit govern-
mental discrimination against health care providers that 
do not participate in abortion. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Conscience Protection 
4
Act of 2021’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds as follows: 
7
(1) Thomas Jefferson stated a conviction com-
8
mon to our Nation’s founders when he declared in 
9
1809 that ‘‘[n]o provision in our Constitution ought 
10
to be dearer to man than that which protects the 
11
rights of conscience against the enterprises of the 
12
civil authority’’. 
13
(2) In 1973, the Supreme Court concluded that 
14
the government must leave the abortion decision ‘‘to 
15
the medical judgment of the pregnant woman’s at-
16
tending physician’’, recognizing that a physician may 
17
choose not to participate in abortion. Roe v. Wade, 
18
410 U.S. 113, 164 (1973). The Court cited with ap-
19
proval a policy that ‘‘neither physician, hospital, nor 
20
hospital personnel shall be required to perform any 
21

•HR 6060 IH
act violative of personally-held moral principles’’, 
1
410 U.S. at 143 n. 38, and cited State laws uphold-
2
ing this principle. Doe v. Bolton, 410 U.S. 179, 
3
197–8 (1973). 
4
(3) Religious diversity adds to the strength of 
5
our medical field, and no doctor should have to 
6
choose between giving up their faith or moral convic-
7
tions and abandoning a vital medical mission. Con-
8
gress’ enactments to protect this right of conscience 
9
in health care include the Church amendments (42 
10
U.S.C. 300a–7), the Coats/Snowe amendment (42 
11
U.S.C. 238n), and the Weldon amendment approved 
12
by Congresses and Presidents of both parties every 
13
year since 2004 (including in section 507(d) of divi-
14
sion A of the Further Consolidated Appropriations 
15
Act, 2020 (Public Law 116–94; 133 Stat. 2534, 
16
2607)). 
17
(4) Courts have declined to find that these laws 
18
provide a ‘‘private right of action’’ thereby leaving 
19
victims of discrimination unable to defend their con-
20
science rights in court, while at the same time ad-
21
ministrative enforcement by the Office for Civil 
22
Rights of the Department of Health and Human 
23
Services has been inconsistent, at times allowing 
24
cases to languish for years without resolution.

(5) Defying the Weldon amendment, Califor-
1
nia’s Department of Managed Health Care has man-
2
dated coverage for elective abortions in all health 
3
plans under its jurisdiction. Other States such as 
4
New York, Illinois, and Washington have taken or 
5
considered similar action, and some States may go 
6
farther to require all physicians and hospitals to pro-
7
vide or facilitate abortions. On June 21, 2016, the 
8
Office for Civil Rights of the Department of Health 
9
and Human Services under the Obama Administra-
10
tion concluded a nearly 2-year investigation of this 
11
matter by determining that California’s decision to 
12
require insurance plans under the California Depart-
13
ment for Managed Health Care authority to cover 
14
abortion services did not violate the Weldon amend-
15
ment. At least 28,000 individuals and families sub-
16
sequently lost abortion-free health plans as a result 
17
of this mandate. 
18
(6) On January 24, 2020, the Office for Civil 
19
Rights of the Department of Health and Human 
20
Services disavowed its prior findings and issued a 
21
notice of violation of the Weldon amendment to Cali-
22
fornia. After the State’s continued noncompliance 
23
with the Weldon amendment, the Centers for Medi-
24
care & Medicaid Services, on December 16, 2020, 
25
05:01 Dec 07, 2021

•HR 6060 IH
announced the disallowance of $200,000,000 per 
1
quarter in Federal funds to California beginning in 
2
the first quarter of 2021. Unless the Biden Adminis-
3
tration provides effective and continuing enforce-
4
ment against California and other States, individuals 
5
will continue to be coerced contrary to law into 
6
choosing between violating their consciences or for-
7
going health care coverage for themselves, their em-
8
ployees, or their families. 
9
(7) On May 21, 2019, the Secretary of Health 
10
and Human Services issued a final conscience rule 
11
that implements approximately 25 Federal con-
12
science protection provisions and provides mecha-
13
nisms to enforce protections enacted by Congress to 
14
ensure that the government and government-funded 
15
entities are not unlawfully discriminating against in-
16
dividuals, health care providers, or health care enti-
17
ties. Despite this regulation providing for enforce-
18
ment of laws passed by Congress, a Federal district 
19
court vacated the rule. Now, litigation is pending be-
20
fore the United States Court of Appeals for the Sec-
21
ond Circuit where 78 members of Congress have 
22
filed a brief in support of the rule, as well as the 
23
United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir-
24
cuit. Litigation in both Circuits have been halted be-
25

H6060
6 
•HR 6060 IH
cause the Biden Administration has indicated its in-
1
tent to revisit the rule. 
2
(8) The vast majority of medical professionals 
3
do not perform abortions, with up to 86 percent of 
4
obstetricians/gynecologists unwilling to provide them 
5
(Obstetrics & Gynecology, Sept. 2011) and the great 
6
majority of hospitals choosing to do so only in rare 
7
cases or not at all. 
8
(9) A health care provider’s decision not to par-
9
ticipate in an abortion, like Congress’ decision not to 
10
fund most abortions, erects no barrier to those seek-
11
ing to perform or undergo abortions but leaves each 
12
party free to act as he or she wishes. 
13
(10) Such protection poses no conflict with 
14
other Federal laws, such as the law requiring stabi-
15
lizing treatment for a pregnant woman and her un-
16
born child when either needs emergency care (Emer-
17
gency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act). As 
18
previous Administrations have said, these areas of 
19
law have operated side by side for many years and 
20
both should be fully enforced (76 Fed. Reg. 9968– 
21
77 (2011) at 9973). 
22
(11) Reaffirming longstanding Federal policy 
23
on conscience rights and providing a right of action 
24

in cases where it is violated allows longstanding and
