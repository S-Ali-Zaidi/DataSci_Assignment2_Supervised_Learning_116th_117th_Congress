(1) small business participation in the Federal 
1
marketplace is key to ensuring a strong industrial 
2
base; 
3
(2) the Business Opportunity Development Re-
4
form Act of 1988 (Public Law 100–656) sets forth 
5
the requirement for the President to establish Gov-
6
ernmentwide goals for procurement contracts award-
7
ed to small businesses; 
8
(3) each year, the Small Business Administra-
9
tion works with each Federal agency to set their re-
10
spective contracting goals and publishes a scorecard 
11
to ensure that the total of all Federal agency goals 
12
meets the required targets for the Federal Govern-
13
ment; 
14
(4) the Department has received among the 
15
highest scorecard letter grades 10 years in a row 
16
and is the largest Federal agency to have such a 
17
track record; 
18
(5) in virtually every segment of the economy of 
19
the United States, including the homeland security 
20
community, there are small businesses working to 
21
support the mission and playing a critical role in de-
22
livering efficient and innovative solutions to the ac-
23
quisition needs of the Federal Government;

3
tive acquisition techniques across the Homeland 
4
Security Enterprise;

(B) provides a forum to test new ideas, 
6
share lessons learned, and promote best prac-
7
tices; 
8
(C) fosters cultural changes that promote 
9
innovation and managed risk taking through a 
10
continuous cycle of testing, obtaining feedback, 
11
sharing information, and retesting where appro-
12
priate; and 
13
(D) aims to make the acquisition process 
14
more smooth and innovative within the con-
15
struct of the Federal Acquisition Regulation for 
16
both the Federal Government and contractors; 
17
and 
18
(7) despite progress in the adoption of new and 
19
better business practices by many Federal agencies, 
20
the overall adoption of modernized business practices 
21
and advanced technologies across the Federal Gov-
22
ernment remains slow and uneven.
