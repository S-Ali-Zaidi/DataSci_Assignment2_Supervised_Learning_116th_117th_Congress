•HR 6805 IH
(1) during the period beginning in 1619 and 
1
ending in 1865, millions of African Americans 
2
throughout the United States were enslaved; 
3
(2) slaveholders often— 
4
(A) controlled where and how deceased 
5
slaves were buried; and 
6
(B) prohibited the burial of slaves on valu-
7
able land; 
8
(3) as a result of the practices described in 
9
paragraph (2), slave burial grounds were often con-
10
fined to remote areas or marginal property; 
11
(4) slave burial grounds— 
12
(A) were rarely documented; and 
13
(B) infrequently appear on historical maps; 
14
(5) a lack of accurate information is typical of 
15
African-American cemeteries originating before the 
16
Civil War; 
17
(6) following the end of slavery, many African- 
18
American families continued to face restrictions on 
19
where the deceased could be buried; 
20
(7) across many areas of the United States, 
21
local laws segregated burial sites by race; 
22
(8) African-American burial grounds often 
23
failed to receive the type of maintenance and record-

keeping that predominantly White burial grounds 
1
enjoyed; 
2
(9) many African-American burial grounds 
3
from before and after the Civil War are in a state 
4
of disrepair or inaccessibility due to overgrowth of 
5
vegetation, crumbling physical structures, and other 
6
challenges; 
7
(10) there is no official national record or data-
8
base for African-American burial ground locations; 
9
(11) the location of many African-American 
10
burial sites is unknown; 
11
(12) as a result of the issues described in para-
12
graphs (10) and (11), the family members and de-
13
scendants of the individuals interred are unable to 
14
visit the burial sites to honor and remember their 
15
ancestors; 
16
(13) 
abandoned 
African-American 
burial 
17
grounds are often discovered when construction 
18
projects inadvertently disturb human remains, which 
19
slows or halts completion of the projects; 
20
(14) the presence and location of historic Afri-
21
can-American burial grounds should be recorded; 
22
(15) there should be coordinated national, 
23
State, local, and Tribal efforts to preserve and re-
24
store African-American burial grounds;

(16) African-American burial grounds are an 
1
integral component of the heritage of the United 
2
States; and 
3
(17) establishing a program to preserve pre-
4
viously abandoned, underserved, and other African- 
5
American burial grounds would help communities 
6
identify and record burial grounds and preserve local 
7
history, while better informing development decisions

and community planning.

SEC. 3. PURPOSE. 
10
The purpose of this Act is to authorize the National 
11
Park Service to coordinate and facilitate Federal activities 
12
and non-Federal activities to identify, interpret, research, 
13
preserve, and record unmarked, previously abandoned, un-
14
derserved, and other African-American burial grounds.
