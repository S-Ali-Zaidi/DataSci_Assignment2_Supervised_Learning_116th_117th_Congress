RESOLUTION 
Condemning the Biden administration’s plans for seeking 
to remove sanctions on the oppressive Maduro regime 
and negotiating with Iran in response to the crisis in 
Ukraine, and instead calling for Congress and the admin-
istration to support the production of American energy. 
Whereas the United States was a net energy exporter before 
President Biden took office; 
Whereas America’s energy independence ended within 1 year 
of the Biden Presidency; 
Whereas President Biden’s hostile policies toward American 
energy production discouraged investment in domestic en-
ergy infrastructure and production; 
Whereas President Biden issued Executive orders to revoke 
permitting for the Keystone XL Pipeline and issued a 
moratorium on energy production on Federal lands on 
day 1 of his Presidency; 
Whereas President Biden supported the Russian oil industry 
by refusing to sanction the Nord Stream 2 pipeline; 
Whereas a lack of domestically produced energy forces the 
United States to rely on imported oil; 
Whereas because of the suspension of Russian oil imports 
after Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, officials 
in the Biden administration have met with Venezuelan 
and Iranian officials to negotiate oil imports to replace 
banned Russian oil imports; 
Whereas President Biden’s Department of State acknowl-
edges that the Governments of Venezuela and Iran fre-
quently violate the human rights of their citizens with ar-
bitrary arrests, use of torture, extrajudicial killings,

State-sanctioned murder of protestors, and the holding of 
prisoners of conscience; 
Whereas, on January 28, 2019, the Trump administration 
imposed sanctions that prohibit the importation of Ven-
ezuelan oil in response to the Maduro regime’s subversion 
of democratically elected President of Venezuela, Juan 
Guaido´; 
Whereas, instead of importing oil from another autocratic re-
gime and enriching human rights abusers, the oil that 
United States consumers need could be produced domes-
tically; 
Whereas increasing oil and natural gas production in the 
United States will significantly reduce energy costs for 
American households and reduce the inflationary burden 
faced by American families; and 
Whereas unleashing the full force of the patriotic and hard- 
working United States energy producers to supply the 
needs of Europe and reduce their reliance on Russian en-
ergy will significantly reduce the ability of Russian war 
criminal Vladimir Putin to fund his genocidal attack 
against the free people of the democratic Nation of 
Ukraine: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That—

(1) the House of Representatives calls on the
