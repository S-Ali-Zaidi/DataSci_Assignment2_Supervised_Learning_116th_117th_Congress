In this Act:

•HR 4832 IH
water is transferred from the land to the atmosphere 
1
by— 
2

3
faces; and 
4
(B) transpiration from plants. 
5
(2) PROGRAM.—The term ‘‘program’’ means 
6
the Open Access Evapotranspiration (OpenET) Data 
7
Program established under section 4(a). 
8
(3) PROGRAM PARTNER.—The term ‘‘program 
9
partner’’ means— 
10
(A) an institution of higher education; 
11
(B) a State (including a State agency); 
12

SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
20
Congress finds that— 
21
(1) evapotranspiration is the second largest 
22
component of the water budget, which is an account-
23
ing of the allocation of water resources to various 
24
water uses; 
25
01:10 Aug 10, 2021
H4832

•HR 4832 IH
(2) evapotranspiration is a measure of the 
1
water that is consumed and lost from a water sys-
2
tem, removed from available supplies, and unavail-
3
able for other uses within a watershed; 
4
(3) accurate information on evapotranspiration 
5
is required to balance water supply and water de-
6
mand in a watershed and ensure that adequate 
7
water supplies for beneficial uses are available over 
8
time; 
9
(4) water users and managers are impeded in 
10
more efficient decisionmaking by— 
11
(A) the lack of consistent and comprehen-
12
sive water use data; and 
13
(B) the fact that access to existing data is 
14
often limited and cost-prohibitive; and 
15
(5) evapotranspiration data may be applied for 
16
the purposes of— 
17
(A) assisting users and decisionmakers to 
18
better manage resources and protect financial 
19
viability of farm operations during drought; 
20
(B) developing more accurate water budg-
21
ets and innovative management programs to 
22
better promote conservation and sustainability 
23
efforts; and

SEC. 4. OPEN ACCESS EVAPOTRANSPIRATION (OPENET) 
4
DATA PROGRAM. 
5
(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—The Secretary shall establish 
6
an Open Access Evapotranspiration (OpenET) Data Pro-
7
gram under which the Secretary shall provide for the deliv-
8
ery of satellite-based evapotranspiration data— 
9
(1) to advance the quantification of evaporation 
10
and consumptive water use; and 
11
(2) to provide data users with field-scale esti-
12
mates of evapotranspiration data across large land-
13
scapes over certain periods of time. 
14
(b) PURPOSE.—The purpose of the program is to 
15
support the operational distribution of satellite-based 
16
evapotranspiration data generated under the program to 
17
sustain and enhance water resources in the United States. 
18
(c) DUTIES.—In carrying out the program, the Sec-
19
retary shall— 
20
(1) evaluate, use, and modify sources of sat-
21
ellite-based evapotranspiration data based on best 
22
available science and technologies; and 
23
(2) coordinate and consult with—

17
an emphasis on carrying out activities that would— 
18
(1) support the development and maintenance 
19
of evapotranspiration data and software systems and 
20
associated research and development in a manner 
21
that ensures that program data are reflective of the
