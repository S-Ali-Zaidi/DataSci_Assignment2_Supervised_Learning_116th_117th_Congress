SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The true date of America’s founding is July 
3
4, 1776, the day the Declaration of Independence 
4
was adopted by the Second Continental Congress. 
5
(2) The self-evident truths set forth by that 
6
Declaration are the fundamental principles upon 
7
which America was founded. 
8
(3) An activist movement is now gaining mo-
9
mentum to deny or obfuscate this history by claim-
10
ing that America was not founded on the ideals of 
11
the Declaration but rather on slavery and oppres-
12
sion. 
13
(4) This distortion of American history is being 
14
taught to children in public school classrooms via the 
15
New York Times’ ‘‘1619 Project’’, which claims that 
16
‘‘nearly everything that has truly made America ex-
17
ceptional’’ grew ‘‘out of slavery’’. 
18
(5) The 1619 Project is a racially divisive and 
19
revisionist account of history that threatens the in-
20
tegrity of the Union by denying the true principles 
21
on which it was founded. 
22
(6) The Federal Government has a strong in-
23
terest in promoting an accurate account of the Na-
24
tion’s history through public schools and forming
