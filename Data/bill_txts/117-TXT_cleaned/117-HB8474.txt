Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

Congress finds the following:

•HR 8474 IH
(1) The public service loan forgiveness program 
1
under section 455(m) of the Higher Education Act 
2
of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1087e(m)) was created in 2007 
3
to attract individuals to public service by forgiving 
4
an individual’s Federal loans under part D of title 
5
IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 
6
1071 et seq.; 20 U.S.C. 1087a et seq.) after 10 
7
years of employment in areas of national need. 
8
(2) These public service careers, which include 
9
employment in military, emergency management, 
10
government, public safety, law enforcement, public 
11
health, education, child care, social work, services for 
12
individuals with disabilities, services for the elderly, 
13
public interest legal services, and library sciences, 
14
pay substantially less than similar careers in the pri-
15
vate sector. 
16
(3) The public sector also repeatedly experi-
17
ences workforce shortages, especially following the 
18
COVID–19 pandemic. 
19
(4) An undergraduate degree, certification, or 
20
advanced degree is a prerequisite to enter or ad-
21
vance in these public service careers. Yet, research 
22
suggests that the prospect of several decades of stu-
23
dent loan payments often deters individuals from 
24
pursuing careers in public service. 
25

•HR 8474 IH
(5) The public service loan forgiveness program 
1
has substantially failed. In 2018, 99 percent of the 
2
borrowers who applied for relief under the program 
3
were denied due to improper type of loans, employ-
4
ment, or repayment plan, or the number of pay-
5
ments that they had made. 
6
(6) Advocates and enforcement agencies, includ-
7
ing 38 State Attorneys General and the Bureau of 
8
Consumer Financial Protection, have repeatedly 
9
found that all of the major Federal student loan 
10
servicers provided inaccurate information to bor-
11
rowers who were interested in or relying upon the 
12
public service loan forgiveness program. They also 
13
found that servicers repeatedly steered borrowers 
14
away from public service loan forgiveness into higher 
15
monthly 
payments 
and 
into 
deferment 
and 
16
forbearances. 
17
(7) This has caused millions of public servants 
18
irreparable economic harm, including preventing 
19
them from buying a home, opening a small business, 
20
starting a family, or retiring, because of their stu-
21
dent debt. 
22
(8) Despite the recent actions of President 
23
Biden’s administration to improve the public service 
24
loan forgiveness program, these actions are limited 
25

and will not fully atone for the repeated, pervasive, 
1
and systemic actions by Federal student loan 
2
servicers to prevent public servants from fully bene-
3
fitting from this program.
