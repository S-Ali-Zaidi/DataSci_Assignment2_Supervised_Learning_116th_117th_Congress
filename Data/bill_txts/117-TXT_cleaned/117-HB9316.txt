3
versary of the United States Marine Corps.

the course of its illustrious 250-year history, fought 
6
gallantly in defense of the United States. 
7
(3) The United States Marine Corps has estab-
8
lished itself as a leading military force, always pre-

pared for tomorrow’s challenges and to contend with 
10
the future character of war. 
11
(4) The United States Marine Corps continues 
12
to exemplify the warrior ethos that has made it a 
13
fighting force of international repute. 
14
(5) All Americans should commemorate the leg-
15
acy of the United States Marine Corps and recog-
16
nize the significant contributions the values em-
17
bodied in the Corps have made in protecting the 
18
United States against its enemies.

20

3
Heritage Center opened to the public, with exhibits 
4
that share the history of the Marine Corps from 
5
1775 until 1975, and with planned future exhibits

on modern day Marine Corps history from the end 
7
of the Vietnam War through the wars in Iraq and
