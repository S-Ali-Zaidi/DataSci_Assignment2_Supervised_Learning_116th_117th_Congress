Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Ensuring Accurate and 
4
Complete Abortion Data Reporting Act of 2021’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Reporting abortion data has been voluntary 
8
in the past, which has not resulted in complete data 
9
being submitted to the Centers for Disease Control 
10
and Prevention. 
11
(2) While the Centers for Disease Control and 
12
Prevention requests specific data points from each 
13
State and the District of Columbia, there is a great 
14
variety in the information collected and published by 
15
the States. 
16
(3) In fact, there is not a single abortion data 
17
point publicly reported for all fifty States and the 
18
District of Columbia. 
19
(4) Even more alarming, three States that to-
20
gether account for 15 percent of the United States 
21
population of women of childbearing age do not re-
22
port any abortion data to the Centers for Disease 
23
Control and Prevention.

1
and those who survive abortion attempts is critical 
2
to public health and policy analysis.
