•HR 3984 IH
(1) The Chinese Communist Party covered up 
1
the existence and downplayed the seriousness of 
2
SARS–CoV–2, hereinafter referred to as COVID– 
3
19, at least as early as December 2019. 
4
(2) Chinese government officials engaged in a 
5
campaign to silence and delegitimize doctors—in-
6
cluding Dr. Li Wenliang—who were warning their 
7
colleagues and others about COVID–19. 
8
(3) Chinese government officials ordered the de-
9
struction of laboratory samples and research regard-
10
ing COVID–19 in January 2020. 
11
(4) Chinese government officials have detained 
12
or otherwise silenced researchers, journalists, and 
13
citizens who attempted to share information that 
14
could have proven unflattering to the Chinese gov-
15
ernment’s response to the COVID–19 outbreak. 
16
(5) Chinese government officials have expelled 
17
American journalists who were covering the COVID– 
18
19 outbreak in China. 
19
(6) Chinese government officials have attempted 
20
to censor or destroy academic research into COVID– 
21
19 and its origins that might disagree with the offi-
22
cial positions of the Chinese government. 
23
(7) Chinese government officials have inten-
24
tionally underreported or altered official numbers of

•HR 3984 IH
COVID–19 infections and deaths in China, leading 
1
world health experts to make flawed analyses that 
2
severely underestimated the nature and seriousness 
3
of COVID–19. 
4
(8) Academic studies have shown that, had ap-
5
propriate interventions occurred to stop the spread 
6
of COVID–19 even just weeks earlier, the spread of 
7
COVID–19 would have been severely curtailed. 
8
(9) The cover-up of COVID–19 by the Chinese 
9
government has caused significant economic harm in 
10
the United States and around the world. 
11
(10) The cover-up of COVID–19 by the Chinese 
12
government has caused significant death and injury 
13
in the United States and around the world. 
14
(11) The cover-up of COVID–19 by the Chinese 
15
government is, at minimum, grossly negligent behav-
16
ior causing significant injury.
