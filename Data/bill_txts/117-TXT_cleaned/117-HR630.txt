RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of Congress that President Biden must 
secure the United States from terror threats by denying 
entry to certain individuals due to a heightened terror 
threat from an unstable Afghanistan. 
Whereas the Biden administration’s evacuation of United 
States citizens, military personnel, and Afghan allies 
from Afghanistan was ill-executed and required addi-
tional military personnel to be placed in a dangerously 
untenable position to complete an unnecessarily hasty 
withdrawal; 
Whereas the resulting instability in Afghanistan threatens the 
safety of American citizens and the security of the Amer-
ican homeland;

Whereas 13 United States soldiers were killed by a terrorist 
attack at Hamid Karzai International Airport on August 
26, 2021; 
Whereas estimates indicate 5,000 to 7,000 prisoners were re-
leased by the Taliban when they captured Bagram Air 
Base, including many al-Qaida operatives; 
Whereas Afghanistan has previously been a hub for terrorist 
activity and training; 
Whereas Pentagon officials have warned that extremist 
groups could regenerate in Afghanistan within two years 
of the United States withdrawing military forces; 
Whereas, in July 2021, U.S. Customs and Border Protection 
reported 212,672 encounters on the southwest border, 
the highest recorded level; 
Whereas the Biden administration has rescinded or weakened 
border security policies including the southwest border 
wall, the Migrant Protection Protocols, and title 42 ex-
pulsion; and 
Whereas the President has broad authority under section 
212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act to deny 
entry to aliens who pose a threat to the United States 
and the American people: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives calls on 
1
President Biden to use his executive authority under sec-
2
tion 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act to se-
3
cure the border and points of entry by denying entry to 
4
individuals from Afghanistan who pose a terrorist threat 
5
to the United States.
