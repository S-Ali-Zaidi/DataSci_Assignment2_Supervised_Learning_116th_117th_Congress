Congress finds the following:

(1) Every day, public safety officers, including 
1
police officers, firefighters, emergency medical tech-
2
nicians, and others, work to maintain the safety, 
3
health, and well-being of the communities they serve. 
4
(2) From time to time this means being called 
5
to respond to stressful and potentially traumatic sit-
6
uations, sometimes even putting their own lives in 
7
danger. 
8
(3) This work not only puts them at risk for ex-
9
periencing harm, serious injury, and severe trauma, 
10
but also places them at up to 25.6 times higher risk 
11
for developing post-traumatic stress disorder when 
12
compared to those without such experiences. 
13
(4) Psychological evidence indicates law en-
14
forcement officers experience significant job-related 
15
stressors and exposures that may confer increased 
16
risk for mental health morbidities (for example post- 
17
traumatic stress disorder, and suicidal thoughts and 
18
behaviors), and hastened mortality. 
19
(5) Public safety officers often do not have the 
20
resources or support they need, leaving them at 
21
higher risk for long-term mental health con-
22
sequences. 
23
(6) In 2017, the Department of Justice ap-
24
proved 481 Public Safety Officer Benefit (PSOB)

claims, but not one of them for the over 240 public 
1
safety officers who died by suicide that year. 
2
(7) As it currently stands, officers who have 
3
died or are disabled as a result of suicide or post- 
4
traumatic stress disorder do not qualify for this pro-
5
gram, despite officers being more likely to die by 
6
suicide than in the line of duty.

Section 1201 of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe

Streets Act of 1968 (34 U.S.C. 10281) is amended by

adding at the end the following:

‘‘(o) As determined by the Bureau— 
14
‘‘(1) post-traumatic stress disorder or acute 
15
stress disorder suffered by a public safety officer, 
16
and diagnosed by a licensed medical or mental 
17
health professional, shall be presumed to constitute 
18
a personal injury within the meaning of subsection 
19
(a), sustained in the line of duty by the officer, if 
20
the officer, while on duty, engages in situations in-

and 
3
‘‘(2) in the case that a public safety officer de-
4
scribed in paragraph (1) dies by suicide (for pur-
5
poses of a claim under subsection (a)), or is perma-
6
nently and totally disabled as a result of post-trau-
7
matic stress disorder or acute stress disorder, in-
8
cluding as a result of attempted suicide (for pur-
9
poses of a claim under subsection (b)), such death 
10
or disability shall be presumed to be a direct and 
11
proximate result of such engagement, 
12
unless competent psychological or medical evidence estab-
13
lishes that the post-traumatic stress disorder or acute 
14
stress disorder was unrelated to the engagement or was 
15
directly and proximately caused by something other than 
16
the mere presence of post-traumatic stress disorder or 
17
acute stress disorder risk factors. For purposes of para-
18
graph (2), a public safety officer shall be considered per-
19
manently and totally disabled as a result of post-traumatic 
20
stress disorder or acute stress disorder if the officer is un-
21
able to serve as a public safety officer in the same or sub-
22
stantially similar role as the officer was serving prior to 
23
suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder or acute
