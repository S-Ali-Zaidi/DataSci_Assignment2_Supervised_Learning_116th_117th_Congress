•HR 669 IH
(1) The Constitution gives Congress the sole 
1
power to declare war. 
2
(2) The framers of the Constitution understood 
3
that the monumental decision to go to war, which 
4
can result in massive death and the destruction of 
5
civilized society, must be made by the representa-
6
tives of the people and not by a single person. 
7
(3) As stated by section 2(c) of the War Powers 
8
Resolution (Public Law 93–148; 50 U.S.C. 1541), 
9
‘‘the constitutional powers of the President as Com-
10
mander-in-Chief to introduce United States Armed 
11
Forces into hostilities, or into situations where im-
12
minent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated 
13
by the circumstances, are exercised only pursuant to 
14
(1) a declaration of war, (2) specific statutory au-
15
thorization, or (3) a national emergency created by 
16
attack upon the United States, its territories or pos-
17
sessions, or its armed forces’’. 
18
(4) Nuclear weapons are uniquely powerful 
19
weapons that have the capability to instantly kill 
20
millions of people, create long-term health and envi-
21
ronmental consequences throughout the world, di-
22
rectly undermine global peace, and put the United 
23
States at existential risk from retaliatory nuclear 
24
strikes.

•HR 669 IH
(5) A first-use nuclear strike carried out by the 
1
United States would constitute a major act of war. 
2
(6) A first-use nuclear strike conducted absent 
3
a declaration of war by Congress would violate the 
4
Constitution. 
5
(7) The President has the sole authority to au-
6
thorize the use of nuclear weapons, an order which 
7
military officers of the United States must carry out 
8
in accordance with their obligations under the Uni-
9
form Code of Military Justice. 
10
(8) Given its exclusive power under the Con-
11
stitution to declare war, Congress must provide 
12
meaningful checks and balances to the President’s 
13
sole authority to authorize the use of a nuclear 
14
weapon. 
15
(b) DECLARATION OF POLICY.—It is the policy of the 
16
United States that no first-use nuclear strike should be 
17
conducted absent a declaration of war by Congress.
