SEC. 2. PURPOSE AND POLICY. 
1
Congress declares that the following is the policy of 
2
the United States: 
3
(1) Labor-management relationships and part-
4
nerships are based on trust, mutual respect, open 
5
communication, bilateral consensual problem solving, 
6
and shared accountability. Labor-management co-
7
operation fully utilizes the strengths of both parties 
8
to best serve the interests of the public, operating as 
9
a team, to carry out the public safety mission in a 
10
quality work environment. In many public safety 
11
agencies, it is the union that provides the institu-
12
tional stability as elected leaders and appointees 
13
come and go. 
14
(2) State and local public safety officers play an 
15
essential role in the efforts of the United States to 
16
detect, prevent, and respond to terrorist attacks, and 
17
to respond to natural disasters, hazardous materials, 
18
and other mass casualty incidents. State and local 
19
public safety officers, as first responders, are a com-
20
ponent of the National Incident Management Sys-
21
tem, developed by the Department of Homeland Se-
22
curity to coordinate response to and recovery from 
23
terrorism, major natural disasters, and other major 
24
emergencies. Public safety employer-employee co-
25

•HR 3225 IH
operation is essential in meeting these needs and is, 
1
therefore, in the National interest. 
2
(3) The Federal Government needs to encour-
3
age conciliation, mediation, and arbitration to aid 
4
and encourage employers and the representatives of 
5
their employees to reach and maintain agreements 
6
concerning rates of pay, hours, and working condi-
7
tions, and to make all reasonable efforts through ne-
8
gotiations to settle their differences by mutual agree-
9
ment reached through collective bargaining or by 
10
such methods as may be provided for in any applica-
11
ble agreement for the settlement of disputes. 
12
(4) The absence of adequate cooperation be-
13
tween public safety employers and employees has im-
14
plications for the security of employees and can af-
15
fect interstate and intrastate commerce. The lack of 
16
such labor-management cooperation can detrimen-
17
tally impact the upgrading of law enforcement, fire, 
18
and emergency medical services of local commu-
19
nities, the health and well-being of public safety offi-
20
cers, and the morale of law enforcement, fire, and 
21
EMS departments. Additionally, these factors could 
22
have significant commercial repercussions. Moreover, 
23
providing minimal standards for collective bar-
24
gaining negotiations in the public safety sector can 
25

•HR 3225 IH
prevent industrial strife between labor and manage-
1
ment that interferes with the normal flow of com-
2
merce. 
3
(5) Many States and localities already provide 
4
public safety officers with collective bargaining 
5
rights comparable to or greater than the rights and 
6
responsibilities set forth in this Act, and such State 
7
and local laws should be respected.
