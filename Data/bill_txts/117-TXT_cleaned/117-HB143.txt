SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS. 
1
(a) SHORT TITLE.—This Act may be cited as the 
2
‘‘Helping to Encourage Real Opportunity for Veterans 
3
Transitioning from Battlespace to Workplace Act of 
4
2021’’ or the ‘‘HERO Transition from Battlespace to 
5
Workplace Act of 2021’’. 
6
(b) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) 
The 
majority 
of 
men 
and 
women 
8
transitioning from the Armed Services to the civilian 
9
sector have experienced difficulty in making the 
10
transition and regard their greatest challenge to be 
11
finding a job that is meaningful to them even though 
12
nearly 90 percent of them believe they have the gen-
13
eral skills needed to land their ideal job such as 
14
problem solving, leadership, ethics, and time man-
15
agement and most believe they possess specific mar-
16
ketable skills, such as information technology, health 
17
care, mechanical, and aviation. 
18
(2) Among the biggest challenges veterans face 
19
in securing suitable employment in the civilian sector 
20
are: overcoming the difficulty in translating to em-
21
ployers the value of the skills they learned in the 
22
military; competing with candidates who have been 
23
in the workforce longer; the perceived reluctance of 
24
employers to hire due to concerns about multiple de-
25
ployments or military training and time commit-

ments of the Reserve Component; and fears of deal-
1
ing with veterans’ disabilities. 
2
(3) Studies have shown that more than 80 per-
3
cent of veterans transitioning from military service 
4
to the civilian sector regard employer-provided vet-
5
eran support programs as ‘‘critical’’ or ‘‘important’’ 
6
to their success and believe it is important for em-
7
ployers to provide flexible leave for the health issues 
8
they face.
