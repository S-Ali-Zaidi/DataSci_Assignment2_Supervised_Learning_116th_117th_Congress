A BILL 
To authorize appropriations to offset costs resulting from 
reductions in research productivity in connection with 
the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID–19), and for 
other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Research Investment 
4
to Spark the Economy Act of 2021’’ or the ‘‘RISE Act 
5
of 2021’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
7
Congress finds the following: 
8
(1) Federal agencies have provided Federal re-
9
search awardees flexibility during the Coronavirus 
10
Disease 2019 (COVID–19) pandemic to support 
11
graduate and undergraduate students, post-doctoral 
12
students, principal investigators, and administrative 
13
and technical support staff. 
14
(2) Federal agencies may need to provide cur-
15
rent Federal research awardees extensions to cover 
16
time lost in awardee facilities and in the field that 
17
will affect the completion of that agencies’ research 
18
missions and priorities. Additionally, agencies have 
19
allowed federally funded laboratories to donate nec-
20
essary equipment, such as personal protective equip-

ment, to support hospitals and first responders, 
1
which may need to be repurchased and will create 
2
additional expenses under Federal contracts, grants, 
3
and cooperative agreements. 
4
(3) The United States needs to sustain the crit-
5
ical human infrastructure that undergirds the 
6
United States research enterprise, which has created 
7
a longstanding government-university partnership, 
8
that has made the United States the global leader 
9
in innovation, strengthening the health of citizens of 
10
the United States, the economy of the United 
11
States, and national security. 
12
(4) While the Federal Government has made 
13
significant investments in new biomedical research 
14
to address COVID–19, existing research has been 
15
slowed down or stopped due to COVID–19-modified 
16
operations of campuses and laboratories. 
17
(5) Given the modified operations of many uni-
18
versity-based and national laboratories due to the 
19
pandemic, Congress is concerned that the people 
20
who comprise the research workforce (for example, 
21
graduate and undergraduate students, post-doctoral 
22
students, principal investigators, and administrative 
23
and technical support staff) and the future health 
24
and strength of the United States research enter-

prise and manufacturing and technology economies, 
1
among others, are at risk. 
2
(6) While the research capacity of the United 
3
States has demonstrated that it can absorb shocks 
4
and pivot to address immediate national threats, the 
5
scale of the COVID–19 pandemic is still growing 
6
and unprecedented in duration and effect. 
7
(7) Without additional funding, future innova-
8
tions in areas such as quantum, artificial intel-
9
ligence, robotics, computing, advanced wireless, 
10
space exploration, digital agriculture, earth system 
11
observation and prediction, health, and science, tech-
12
nology, engineering, and mathematics education in-
13
frastructure will be forestalled as agencies are forced 
14
to use future appropriations intended for new re-
15
search to cover existing awards. The United States 
16
must innovate to launch the next 50 years of unpar-
17
alleled economic leadership and be prepared for any 
18
future pandemics. 
19
(8) It is vital that the Federal Government take 
20
measures to help relieve the strain that Federal 
21
agencies will be forced to face and sustain the 
22
strength of the ability of the United States to re-
23
main a global leader in an increasingly competitive 
24
global research environment, as other countries con-
