SEC. 3. FINDINGS OF GENERAL CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHOR-
1
ITY. 
2
Congress finds that the Constitution of the United 
3
States grants explicit and broad authority to protect the 
4
right to vote, to regulate elections for Federal office, and 
5
to defend the Nation’s democratic process. Congress en-
6
acts the ‘‘For the People Act of 2021’’ pursuant to this 
7
broad authority, including but not limited to the following: 
8
(1) Congress finds that it has broad authority 
9
to regulate the time, place, and manner of congres-
10
sional elections under the Elections Clause of the 
11
Constitution, article I, section 4, clause 1. The Su-
12
preme Court has affirmed that the ‘‘substantive 
13
scope’’ of the Elections Clause is ‘‘broad’’; that 
14
‘‘Times, Places, and Manner’’ are ‘‘comprehensive 
15
words which embrace authority to provide for a com-
16
plete code for congressional elections’’; and ‘‘[t]he 
17
power of Congress over the Times, Places and Man-
18
18:47 Jan 12, 2021
H1
17 
•HR 1 IH
ner of congressional elections is paramount, and may 
1
be exercised at any time, and to any extent which 
2
it deems expedient; and so far as it is exercised, and 
3
no farther, the regulations effected supersede those 
4
of the State which are inconsistent therewith’’. Ari-
5
zona v. Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, 570 U.S. 1, 
6
8–9 (2013) (internal quotation marks and citations 
7
omitted). Indeed, ‘‘Congress has plenary and para-
8
mount jurisdiction over the whole subject’’ of con-
9
gressional elections, Ex parte Siebold, 100 U.S. (10 
10
Otto) 371, 388 (1879), and this power ‘‘may be ex-
11
ercised as and when Congress sees fit’’, and ‘‘so far 
12
as it extends and conflicts with the regulations of 
13
the State, necessarily supersedes them’’. Id. At 384. 
14
Among other things, Congress finds that the Elec-
15
tions Clause was intended to ‘‘vindicate the people’s 
16
right to equality of representation in the House’’. 
17
Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 U.S. 1, 16 (1964). 
18
(2) Congress also finds that it has both the au-
19
thority and responsibility, as the legislative body for 
20
the United States, to fulfill the promise of article IV, 
21
section 4, of the Constitution, which states: ‘‘The 
22
United States shall guarantee to every State in this 
23
Union a Republican Form of Government[.]’’. Con-
24
gress finds that its authority and responsibility to 
25
18:47 Jan 12, 2021
H1
18 
•HR 1 IH
enforce the Guarantee Clause is particularly strong 
1
given that Federal courts have not enforced this 
2
clause because they understood that its enforcement 
3
is committed to Congress by the Constitution. 
4
(3)(A) Congress also finds that it has broad au-
5
thority pursuant to section 5 of the Fourteenth 
6
Amendment to legislate to enforce the provisions of 
7
the Fourteenth Amendment, including its protec-
8
tions of the right to vote and the democratic process. 
9
(B) Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment 
10
protects the fundamental right to vote, which is ‘‘of 
11
the most fundamental significance under our con-
12
stitutional structure’’. Ill. Bd. of Election v. Socialist 
13
Workers Party, 440 U.S. 173, 184 (1979); see 
14
United States v. Classic, 313 U.S. 299 (1941) (‘‘Ob-
15
viously included within the right to choose, secured 
16
by the Constitution, is the right of qualified voters 
17
within a state to cast their ballots and have them 
18
counted . . .’’). As the Supreme Court has repeatedly 
19
affirmed, the right to vote is ‘‘preservative of all 
20
rights’’, Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 370 
21
(1886). Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment 
22
also protects the right to vote, granting Congress 
23
additional authority to reduce a State’s representa-
24
tion in Congress when the right to vote is denied. 
25

•HR 1 IH
(C) As a result, Congress finds that it has the 
1
authority pursuant to section 5 of the Fourteenth 
2
Amendment to protect the right to vote. Congress 
3
also finds that States and localities have eroded ac-
4
cess to the right to vote through restrictions on the 
5
right to vote including excessively onerous voter 
6
identification requirements, burdensome voter reg-
7
istration procedures, voter purges, limited and un-
8
equal access to voting by mail, polling place closures, 
9
unequal distribution of election resources, and other 
10
impediments. 
11
(D) Congress also finds that ‘‘the right of suf-
12
frage can be denied by a debasement or dilution of 
13
the weight of a citizen’s vote just as effectively as by 
14
wholly prohibiting the free exercise of the franchise’’. 
15
Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 555 (1964). Con-
16
gress finds that the right of suffrage has been so di-
17
luted and debased by means of gerrymandering of 
18
districts. Congress finds that it has authority pursu-
19
ant to section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to 
20
remedy this debasement. 
21
(4)(A) Congress also finds that it has authority 
22
to legislate to eliminate racial discrimination in vot-
23
ing and the democratic process pursuant to both sec-
24
tion 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, which grants 
25
18:47 Jan 12, 2021

•HR 1 IH
equal protection of the laws, and section 2 of the 
1
Fifteenth Amendment, which explicitly bars denial 
2
or abridgment of the right to vote on account of 
3
race, color, or previous condition of servitude. 
4
(B) Congress finds that racial discrimination in 
5
access to voting and the political process persists. 
6
Voting restrictions, redistricting, and other electoral 
7
practices and processes continue to disproportion-
8
ately impact communities of color in the United 
9
States and do so as a result of both intentional ra-
10
cial discrimination, structural racism, and the ongo-
11
ing structural socioeconomic effects of historical ra-
12
cial discrimination. 
13
(C) Recent elections and studies have shown 
14
that minority communities wait longer in lines to 
15
vote, are more likely to have their mail ballots re-
16
jected, continue to face intimidation at the polls, are 
17
more likely to be disenfranchised by voter purges, 
18
and are disproportionately burdened by voter identi-
19
fication and other voter restrictions. Research shows 
20
that communities of color are more likely to face 
21
nearly every barrier to voting than their white coun-
22
terparts. 
23
(D) Congress finds that racial disparities in dis-
24
enfranchisement due to past felony convictions is 
25
18:47 Jan 12, 2021

•HR 1 IH
particularly stark. In 2020, according to the Sen-
1
tencing Project, an estimated 5,200,000 Americans 
2
could not vote due to a felony conviction. One in 16 
3
African Americans of voting age is disenfranchised, 
4
a rate 3.7 times greater than that of non-African 
5
Americans. In seven States–Alabama, Florida, Ken-
6
tucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, Virginia, and Wyo-
7
ming–more than one in seven African Americans is 
8
disenfranchised, twice the national average for Afri-
9
can Americans. Congress finds that felony disenfran-
10
chisement was one of the tools of intentional racial 
11
discrimination during the Jim Crow era. Congress 
12
further finds that current racial disparities in felony 
13
disenfranchisement are linked to this history of voter 
14
suppression, structural racism in the criminal justice 
15
system, and ongoing effects of historical discrimina-
16
tion. 
17
(5)(A) Congress finds that it further has the 
18
power to protect the right to vote from denial or 
19
abridgment on account of sex, age, or ability to pay 
20
a poll tax or other tax pursuant to the Nineteenth, 
21
Twenty-Fourth, and Twenty-Sixth Amendments.

age.

SEC. 1401. SHORT TITLE. 
9
This subtitle may be cited as the ‘‘Democracy Res-
10
toration Act of 2021’’. 
11
SEC. 1402. FINDINGS. 
12
Congress makes the following findings: 
13
(1) The right to vote is the most basic constitu-
14
tive act of citizenship. Regaining the right to vote 
15
reintegrates individuals with criminal convictions 
16
into free society, helping to enhance public safety. 
17
(2) Article I, section 4, of the Constitution 
18
grants Congress ultimate supervisory power over 
19
Federal elections, an authority which has repeatedly 
20
been upheld by the Supreme Court. 
21
(3) Basic constitutional principles of fairness 
22
and equal protection require an equal opportunity 
23
for citizens of the United States to vote in Federal 
24
elections. The right to vote may not be abridged or 
25
18:47 Jan 12, 2021
H1
137 
•HR 1 IH
denied by the United States or by any State on ac-
1
count of race, color, gender, or previous condition of 
2
servitude. The 13th, 14th, 15th, 19th, 24th, and 
3
26th Amendments to the Constitution empower Con-
4
gress to enact measures to protect the right to vote 
5
in Federal elections. The 8th Amendment to the 
6
Constitution provides for no excessive bail to be re-
7
quired, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and 
8
unusual punishments inflicted. 
9
(4) There are 3 areas in which discrepancies in 
10
State laws regarding criminal convictions lead to un-
11
fairness in Federal elections: 
12
(A) The lack of a uniform standard for 
13
voting in Federal elections leads to an unfair 
14
disparity and unequal participation in Federal 
15
elections based solely on where a person lives. 
16
(B) Laws governing the restoration of vot-
17
ing rights after a criminal conviction vary 
18
throughout the country, and persons in some 
19
States can easily regain their voting rights 
20
while in other States persons effectively lose 
21
their right to vote permanently. 
22
(C) State disenfranchisement laws dis-
23
proportionately impact racial and ethnic minori-
24
ties. 
25
18:47 Jan 12, 2021
H1
138 
•HR 1 IH
(5) Two States (Maine and Vermont), the Dis-
1
trict of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto 
2
Rico do not disenfranchise individuals with criminal 
3
convictions at all, but 48 States have laws that deny 
4
convicted individuals the right to vote while they are 
5
in prison. 
6
(6) In some States disenfranchisement results 
7
from varying State laws that restrict voting while in-
8
dividuals are under the supervision of the criminal 
9
justice system or after they have completed a crimi-
10
nal sentence. In 30 States, convicted individuals may 
11
not vote while they are on parole and 27 States dis-
12
enfranchise individuals on felony probation as well. 
13
In 11 States, a conviction can result in lifetime dis-
14
enfranchisement. 
15
(7) Several States deny the right to vote to in-
16
dividuals convicted of certain misdemeanors. 
17
(8) An estimated 5,200,000 citizens of the 
18
United States, or about 1 in 44 adults in the United 
19
States, currently cannot vote as a result of a felony 
20
conviction. Of the 5,200,000 citizens barred from 
21
voting, only 24 percent are in prison. By contrast, 
22
75 percent of the disenfranchised reside in their 
23
communities while on probation or parole or after 
24
having completed their sentences. Approximately 
25
18:47 Jan 12, 2021
H1
139 
•HR 1 IH
2,200,000 citizens who have completed their sen-
1
tences remain disenfranchised due to restrictive 
2
State laws. In at least 6 States—Alabama, Florida, 
3
Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Virginia— 
4
more than 5 percent of the total voting-age popu-
5
lation is disenfranchised. 
6
(9) In those States that disenfranchise individ-
7
uals post-sentence, the right to vote can be regained 
8
in theory, but in practice this possibility is often 
9
granted in a non-uniform and potentially discrimina-
10
tory manner. Disenfranchised individuals must ei-
11
ther obtain a pardon or an order from the Governor 
12
or an action by the parole or pardon board, depend-
13
ing on the offense and State. Individuals convicted 
14
of a Federal offense often have additional barriers to 
15
regaining voting rights. 
16
(10) State disenfranchisement laws dispropor-
17
tionately impact racial and ethnic minorities. More 
18
than 6 percent of the African-American voting-age 
19
population, or 1,800,000 African Americans, are 
20
disenfranchised. Currently, 1 of every 16 voting-age 
21
African Americans are rendered unable to vote be-
22
cause of felony disenfranchisement, which is a rate 
23
more than 3.7 times greater than non-African Amer-
24
icans. Over 6 percent of African-American adults are 
25
18:47 Jan 12, 2021

•HR 1 IH
disenfranchised whereas only 1.7 percent of non-Af-
1
rican Americans are. In 7 States (Alabama, 16 per-
2
cent; Florida, 15 percent; Kentucky, 15 percent; 
3
Mississippi, 16 percent; Tennessee, 21 percent; Vir-
4
ginia, 16 percent; and Wyoming, 36 percent), more 
5
than 1 in 7 African Americans are unable to vote 
6
because of prior convictions, twice the national aver-
7
age for African Americans. 
8
(11) Latino citizens are disproportionately 
9
disenfranchised based upon their disproportionate 
10
representation in the criminal justice system. In re-
11
cent years, Latinos have been imprisoned at 2.5 
12
times the rate of Whites. More than 2 percent of the 
13
voting-age Latino population, or 560,000 Latinos, 
14
are disenfranchised due to a felony conviction. In 34 
15
states Latinos are disenfranchised at a higher rate 
16
than the general population. In 11 states 4 percent 
17
or more of Latino adults are disenfranchised due to 
18
a felony conviction (Alabama, 4 percent; Arizona, 7 
19
percent; Arkansas, 4 percent; Idaho, 4 percent; 
20
Iowa, 4 percent; Kentucky, 6 percent; Minnesota, 4 
21
percent; Mississippi, 5 percent; Nebraska, 6 percent; 
22
Tennessee, 11 percent, Wyoming, 4 percent), twice 
23
the national average for Latinos.

•HR 1 IH
(12) Disenfranchising citizens who have been 
1
convicted of a criminal offense and who are living 
2
and working in the community serves no compelling 
3
State interest and hinders their rehabilitation and 
4
reintegration into society. 
5
(13) State disenfranchisement laws can sup-
6
press electoral participation among eligible voters by 
7
discouraging voting among family and community 
8
members of disenfranchised persons. Future elec-
9
toral participation by the children of disenfranchised 
10
parents may be impacted as well.

Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) The right to vote for all Americans is sac-
8
rosanct and rules for voting and election administra-
9
tion should protect the right to vote and promote 
10
voter participation. 
11
(2) The Voting Rights Act has empowered the 
12
Department of Justice and Federal courts for nearly 
13
a half a century to block discriminatory voting prac-
14
tices before their implementation in States and local-
15
ities with the most troubling histories and ongoing 
16
records of racial discrimination. 
17
(3) There continues to be an alarming move-
18
ment to erect barriers to make it more difficult for 
19
Americans to participate in our Nation’s democratic 
20
process. The Nation has witnessed unprecedented ef-
21
forts to turn back the clock and erect barriers to 
22
voting for communities of color which have faced

historic and continuing discrimination, as well as

(4) The Supreme Court’s 2013 Shelby County 
1
v. Holder decision gutted decades-long Federal pro-
2
tections for communities of color that face historic 
3
and continuing discrimination, emboldening States 
4
and local jurisdictions to pass voter suppression laws 
5
and implement procedures, such as those requiring 
6
photo identification, limiting early voting hours, 
7
eliminating same-day registration, purging voters 
8
from the rolls, and reducing the number of polling 
9
places. Congress is committed to reversing the dev-
10
astating impact of this decision. 
11
(5) Racial discrimination in voting is a clear 
12
and persistent problem. The actions of States and 
13
localities around the country post-Shelby County, in-
14
cluding at least 10 findings by Federal courts of in-
15
tentional discrimination, underscore the need for 
16
Congress to conduct investigatory and evidentiary 
17
hearings to determine the legislation necessary to re-
18
store the Voting Rights Act and combat continuing 
19
efforts in America that suppress the free exercise of 
20
the franchise in communities of color.

22
tions provide further evidence that systemic voter 
23

24
communities of color across the country, making it

clear that democracy reform cannot be achieved 
1

4

5
respond by modernizing the electoral system to—

(A) improve access to the ballot; 
7
(B) enhance the integrity and security of 
8
our voting systems;

10
traditional addresses for residents on Indian reserva-
11
tions, inadequate language assistance for Tribal

Congress finds the following: 
18
(1) The 705,000 District of Columbia residents 
19
deserve voting representation in Congress and local 
20
self-government, which only statehood can provide. 
21

national legislature and local self-government to the

2
in the District of Columbia should not be granted 
3
statehood.

(4) Since the founding of the United States, the 
5
residents of the District of Columbia have always 
6
carried all of the obligations of citizenship, including 
7
serving in all of the Nation’s wars and paying Fed-
8
eral taxes, but have been denied voting representa-
9
tion in Congress and freedom from congressional in-
10
terference in purely local matters.

(5) The District of Columbia pays more Federal 
12
taxes per capita than any State and more Federal 
13
taxes than 22 States.

(6) The District of Columbia has a larger popu-
15

Congress finds the following:

(1) Criminals, terrorists, and corrupt govern-

ment officials frequently abuse anonymously held 
8
Limited Liability Companies (LLCs), also known as 
9
‘‘shell companies,’’ to hide, move, and launder the 
10
dirty money derived from illicit activities such as 
11
trafficking, bribery, exploitation, and embezzlement. 
12
Ownership and control of the finances that run 
13
through shell companies are obscured to regulators 
14
and law enforcement because little information is re-
15
quired and collected when establishing these entities. 
16
(2) The public release of the ‘‘Panama Papers’’ 
17
in 2016 and the ‘‘Paradise Papers’’ in 2017 revealed 
18
that these shell companies often purchase and sell 
19
United States real estate. United States anti-money

ficiaries and transactions from regulators and law

(3) Since the Supreme Court’s decisions in Citi-
3
zens United v. Federal Election Commission, 558 
4
U.S. 310 (2010), millions of dollars have flowed into 
5
super PACs through LLCs whose funders are anon-
6
ymous or intentionally obscured. Criminal investiga-
7
tions have uncovered LLCs that were used to hide 
8
illegal campaign contributions from foreign criminal 
9
fugitives, to advance international influence-buying 
10
schemes, and to conceal contributions from donors 
11
who were already under investigation for bribery and 
12
racketeering. Voters have no way to know the true 
13
sources of the money being routed through these 
14
LLCs to influence elections, including whether any 
15
of the funds come from foreign or other illicit 
16
sources. 
17
(4) Congress should curb the use of anonymous 
18
shell companies for illicit purposes by requiring 
19
United States companies to disclose their beneficial 
20
owners, strengthening anti-money laundering and 
21
counter-terrorism finance laws.

Congress makes the following findings: 
14
(1) On January 6, 2017, the Office of the Di-
15
rector of National Intelligence published a report ti-
16
tled ‘‘Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in 
17
Recent U.S. Elections’’, noting that ‘‘Russian Presi-
18
dent Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign 
19
in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election * * 
20
*’’. Moscow’s influence campaign followed a Russian 
21
messaging strategy that blends covert intelligence 
22

23
by Russian Government agencies, state-funded

media, third-party intermediaries, and paid social 
1
media users or ‘‘trolls’’. 
2
(2) On November 24, 2016, The Washington 
3
Post reported findings from 2 teams of independent 
4
researchers that concluded Russians ‘‘exploited 
5
American-made technology platforms to attack U.S. 
6
democracy at a particularly vulnerable moment * * 
7
* as part of a broadly effective strategy of sowing 
8
distrust in U.S. democracy and its leaders.’’. 
9
(3) Findings from a 2017 study on the manipu-
10
lation of public opinion through social media con-
11
ducted by the Computational Propaganda Research 
12
Project at the Oxford Internet Institute found that 
13
the Kremlin is using pro-Russian bots to manipulate 
14
public discourse to a highly targeted audience. With 
15
a sample of nearly 1,300,000 tweets, researchers 
16
found that in the 2016 election’s 3 decisive States, 
17
propaganda constituted 40 percent of the sampled 
18
election-related tweets that went to Pennsylvanians, 
19
34 percent to Michigan voters, and 30 percent to 
20
those in Wisconsin. In other swing States, the figure 
21
reached 42 percent in Missouri, 41 percent in Flor-
22
ida, 40 percent in North Carolina, 38 percent in 
23
Colorado, and 35 percent in Ohio.

(4) On September 6, 2017, the Nation’s largest 
1
social media platform disclosed that between June 
2
2015 and May 2017, Russian entities purchased 
3
$100,000 in political advertisements, publishing 
4
roughly 3,000 ads linked to fake accounts associated 
5
with the Internet Research Agency, a pro-Kremlin 
6
organization. According to the company, the ads 
7
purchased focused ‘‘on amplifying divisive social and 
8
political messages * * *’’. 
9
(5) In 2002, the Bipartisan Campaign Reform 
10
Act became law, establishing disclosure requirements 
11
for political advertisements distributed from a tele-
12
vision or radio broadcast station or provider of cable 
13
or satellite television. In 2003, the Supreme Court 
14
upheld regulations on electioneering communications 
15
established under the Act, noting that such require-
16
ments ‘‘provide the electorate with information and 
17
insure that the voters are fully informed about the 
18
person or group who is speaking.’’. 
19
(6) According to a study from Borrell Associ-
20
ates, in 2016, $1,415,000,000 was spent on online 
21
advertising, more than quadruple the amount in 
22
2012.

provider—has greatly facilitated the scope and effec-
1
tiveness of disinformation campaigns. For instance, 
2
the largest platform has over 210,000,000 Ameri-
3
cans users—over 160,000,000 of them on a daily 
4
basis. By contrast, the largest cable television pro-
5
vider has 22,430,000 subscribers, while the largest 
6
satellite television provider has 21,000,000 sub-
7
scribers. And the most-watched television broadcast 
8
in United States history had 118,000,000 viewers. 
9
(8) The public nature of broadcast television, 
10
radio, and satellite ensures a level of publicity for 
11
any political advertisement. These communications 
12
are accessible to the press, fact-checkers, and polit-
13
ical opponents; this creates strong disincentives for 
14
a candidate to disseminate materially false, inflam-
15
matory, or contradictory messages to the public. So-
16
cial media platforms, in contrast, can target portions 
17
of the electorate with direct, ephemeral advertise-
18
ments often on the basis of private information the 
19
platform has on individuals, enabling political adver-
20
tisements that are contradictory, racially or socially 
21
inflammatory, or materially false. 
22
(9) According to comScore, 2 companies own 8 
23
of the 10 most popular smart phone applications as 
24
of June 2017, including the most popular social

media and email services—which deliver information 
1
and news to users without requiring proactivity by 
2
the user. Those same 2 companies accounted for 99 
3
percent of revenue growth from digital advertising in 
4
2016, including 77 percent of gross spending. 79 
5
percent of online Americans—representing 68 per-
6
cent of all Americans—use the single largest social 
7
network, while 66 percent of these users are most 
8
likely to get their news from that site. 
9
(10) In its 2006 rulemaking, the Federal Elec-
10
tion Commission noted that only 18 percent of all 
11
Americans cited the internet as their leading source 
12
of news about the 2004 Presidential election; by con-
13
trast, the Pew Research Center found that 65 per-
14
cent of Americans identified an internet-based 
15
source as their leading source of information for the 
16
2016 election. 
17
(11) The Federal Election Commission, the 
18
independent Federal agency charged with protecting 
19
the integrity of the Federal campaign finance proc-
20
ess by providing transparency and administering 
21

Campaigns’’, multiple expert witnesses testified that 
2
while the disinformation tactics of foreign adver-
3
saries have not necessarily changed, social media 
4
services now provide ‘‘platform[s] practically pur-
5
pose-built for active measures[.]’’ Similarly, as Gen. 
6
Keith B. Alexander (RET.), the former Director of 
7
the National Security Agency, testified, during the 
8
Cold War ‘‘if the Soviet Union sought to manipulate 
9
information flow, it would have to do so principally 
10
through its own propaganda outlets or through ac-
11
tive measures that would generate specific news: 
12
planting of leaflets, inciting of violence, creation of 
13
other false materials and narratives. But the news 
14
itself was hard to manipulate because it would have 
15
required actual control of the organs of media, which 
16
took long-term efforts to penetrate. Today, however, 
17
because the clear majority of the information on so-
18
cial media sites is uncurated and there is a rapid 
19
proliferation of information sources and other sites 
20
that can reinforce information, there is an increasing 
21
likelihood that the information available to average 
22
consumers may be inaccurate (whether intentionally 
23
or otherwise) and may be more easily manipulable 
24
than in prior eras.’’.

SEC. 4204. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
5
It is the sense of Congress that— 
6
(1) the dramatic increase in digital political ad-
7
vertisements, and the growing centrality of online 
8
platforms in the lives of Americans, requires the 
9
Congress and the Federal Election Commission to 
10
take meaningful action to ensure that laws and reg-
11
ulations provide the accountability and transparency 
12
that is fundamental to our democracy; 
13
(2) free and fair elections require both trans-
14
parency and accountability which give the public a 
15
right to know the true sources of funding for polit-
16
ical advertisements in order to make informed polit-
17
ical choices and hold elected officials accountable; 
18
and 
19
(3) transparency of funding for political adver-
20
tisements is essential to enforce other campaign fi-
21
nance laws, including the prohibition on campaign 
22
spending by foreign nationals.

Subtitle A—Findings Relating to

Citizens United Decision 
2
SEC. 5001. FINDINGS RELATING TO CITIZENS UNITED DECI-
3
SION. 
4
Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) The American Republic was founded on the 
6
principle that all people are created equal, with 
7
rights and responsibilities as citizens to vote, be rep-
8
resented, speak, debate, and participate in self-gov-
9
ernment on equal terms regardless of wealth. To se-
10
cure these rights and responsibilities, our Constitu-
11
tion not only protects the equal rights of all Ameri-
12
cans but also provides checks and balances to pre-
13
vent corruption and prevent concentrated power and 
14
wealth from undermining effective self-government. 
15
(2) The Founders designed the First Amend-
16
ment to help prevent tyranny by ensuring that the 
17
people have the tools they need to ensure self-gov-
18
ernment and to keep their elected leaders responsive 
19
to the public. The Amendment thus guarantees the 
20
right of everyone to speak, to petition the govern-
21
ment for redress, to assemble together, and for a 
22
free press. If only the wealthiest individuals can par-
23
ticipate meaningfully in our democracy, then these 
24
First Amendment principles become an illusion. 
25
18:47 Jan 12, 2021
H1
533 
•HR 1 IH
(3) Campaign finance laws promote these First 
1
Amendment interests. They increase robust debate 
2
from diverse voices, enhance the responsiveness of 
3
elected officeholders, and help prevent corruption. 
4
They do not censor anyone’s speech but simply en-
5
sure that no one’s speech is drowned out. The Su-
6
preme Court has failed to recognize that these laws 
7
are essential, proactive rules that help guarantee 
8
true democratic self-government. 
9
(4) The Supreme Court’s decisions in Citizens 
10
United v. Federal Election Commission, 558 U.S. 
11
310 (2010) and McCutcheon v. FEC, 572 U.S. 185 
12
(2014), as well as other court decisions, erroneously 
13
invalidated even-handed rules about the spending of 
14
money in local, State, and Federal elections. These 
15
rules do not prevent anyone from speaking their 
16
mind, much less pick winners and losers of political 
17
debates. Although the Court has upheld other con-
18
tent-neutral laws like these, it has failed to apply to 
19
same logic to campaign finance laws. These flawed 
20
decisions have empowered large corporations, ex-
21
tremely wealthy individuals, and special interests to 
22
dominate election spending, corrupt our politics, and 
23
degrade our democracy through tidal waves of un-
24
limited and anonymous spending. These decisions 
25
18:47 Jan 12, 2021
H1
534 
•HR 1 IH
also stand in contrast to a long history of efforts by 
1
Congress and the States to regulate money in poli-
2
tics to protect democracy, and they illustrate a trou-
3
bling deregulatory trend in campaign finance-related 
4
court decisions. Additionally, an unknown amount of 
5
foreign money continues to be spent in our political 
6
system as subsidiaries of foreign-based corporations 
7
and hostile foreign actors sometimes connected to 
8
nation-states work to influence our elections. 
9
(5) The Supreme Court’s misinterpretation of 
10
the Constitution to empower monied interests at the 
11
expense of the American people in elections has seri-
12
ously eroded over 100 years of congressional action 
13
to promote fairness and protect elections from the 
14
toxic influence of money. 
15
(6) In 1907, Congress passed the Tillman Act 
16
in response to the concentration of corporate power 
17
in the post-Civil War Gilded Age. The Act prohibited 
18
corporations from making contributions in connec-
19
tion with Federal elections, aiming ‘‘not merely to 
20
prevent the subversion of the integrity of the elec-
21
toral process [but] * * * to sustain the active, alert 
22
responsibility of the individual citizen in a democ-
23
racy for the wise conduct of government’’.

(7) By 1910, Congress began passing disclosure 
1
requirements and campaign expenditure limits, and 
2
dozens of States passed corrupt practices Acts to 
3
prohibit corporate spending in elections. States also 
4
enacted campaign spending limits, and some States 
5
limited the amount that people could contribute to 
6
campaigns.

8
corporations and unions from making campaign con-

tributions or other expenditures to influence elec-
10
tions. In 1962, a Presidential commission on election 
11
spending recommended spending limits and incen-
12
tives to increase small contributions from more peo-
13
ple. 
14
(9) The Federal Election Campaign Act of 
15
1971 (FECA), as amended in 1974, required disclo-
16
sure of contributions and expenditures, imposed con-
17
tribution and expenditure limits for individuals and 
18
groups, set spending limits for campaigns, can-
19
didates, and groups, implemented a public funding 
20
system for Presidential campaigns, and created the 
21
Federal Election Commission to oversee and enforce 
22
the new rules. 
23
(10) In the wake of Citizens United and other 
24
damaging Federal court decisions, Americans have 
25

•HR 1 IH
witnessed an explosion of outside spending in elec-
1
tions. Outside spending increased more than 700 
2
percent between the 2008 and 2020 Presidential 
3
election years. Spending by outside groups nearly 
4
doubled again from 2016 to 2020 with super PACs, 
5
tax-exempt groups, and others spending more than 
6
$3,000,000,000. And as political entities adapt to a 
7
post-Citizens United, post-McCutcheon landscape, 
8
these trends are getting worse, as evidenced by the 
9
record-setting 2020 elections which cost more than 
10
$14,000,000,000 in total. 
11
(11) Since the landmark Citizens United deci-
12
sion, 21 States and more than 800 municipalities, 
13
including large cities like New York, Los Angeles, 
14
Chicago, and Philadelphia, have gone on record sup-
15
porting a constitutional amendment. Transcending 
16
political leanings and geographic location, voters in 
17
States and municipalities across the country that 
18
have placed amendment questions on the ballot have 
19
routinely supported these initiatives by considerably 
20
large margins. 
21
(12) The Court has tied the hands of Congress 
22
and the States, severely restricting them from set-
23
ting reasonable limits on campaign spending. For 
24
example, the Court has held that only the Govern-
25

•HR 1 IH
ment’s interest in preventing quid pro quo corrup-
1
tion, like bribery, or the appearance of such corrup-
2
tion, can justify limits on campaign contributions. 
3
More broadly, the Court has severely curtailed at-
4
tempts to reduce the ability of the Nation’s wealthi-
5
est and most powerful to skew our democracy in 
6
their favor by buying outsized influence in our elec-
7
tions. Because this distortion of the Constitution has 
8
prevented other critical regulation or reform of the 
9
way we finance elections in America, a constitutional 
10
amendment is needed to achieve a democracy for all 
11
the people. 
12
(13) The torrent of money flowing into our po-
13
litical system has a profound effect on the demo-
14
cratic process for everyday Americans, whose voices 
15
and policy preferences are increasingly being 
16
drowned out by those of wealthy special interests. 
17
The more campaign cash from wealthy special inter-
18
ests can flood our elections, the more policies that 
19
favor those interests are reflected in the national po-
20
litical agenda. When it comes to policy preferences, 
21
our Nation’s wealthiest tend to have fundamentally 
22
different views than do average Americans when it 
23
comes to issues ranging from unemployment benefits 
24
to the minimum wage to health care coverage.

(14) At the same time millions of Americans

have signed petitions, marched, called their Members 
2
of Congress, written letters to the editor, and other-
3
wise demonstrated their public support for a con-
4
stitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United 
5
that will allow Congress to reign in the outsized in-
6
fluence of unchecked money in politics. Dozens of 
7
organizations, representing tens of millions of indi-
8
viduals, have come together in a shared strategy of 
9
supporting such an amendment. 
10
(15) In order to protect the integrity of democ-
11
racy and the electoral process and to ensure political 
12
equality for all, the Constitution should be amended 
13
so that Congress and the States may regulate and 
14

4
(a) SHORT TITLE.—This subtitle may be cited as the 
5
‘‘Help America Run Act’’. 
6
(b) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Everyday Americans experience barriers to 
8
entry before they can consider running for office to 
9
serve their communities. 
10
(2) Current law states that campaign funds 
11
cannot be spent on everyday expenses that would 
12
exist whether or not a candidate were running for 
13
office, like childcare and food. While the law seems 
14
neutral, its actual effect is to privilege the independ-
15
ently wealthy who want to run, because given the de-
16
mands of running for office, candidates who must 
17
work to pay for childcare or to afford health insur-
18
ance are effectively being left out of the process, 
19
even if they have sufficient support to mount a via-
20
ble campaign. 
21
(3) Thus current practice favors those prospec-
22
tive candidates who do not need to rely on a regular 
23
paycheck to make ends meet. The consequence is 
24
that everyday Americans who have firsthand knowl-
25
18:47 Jan 12, 2021
H1
637 
•HR 1 IH
edge of the importance of stable childcare, a safety 
1
net, or great public schools are less likely to get a 
2
seat at the table. This governance by the few is anti-
3
thetical to the democratic experiment, but most im-
4
portantly, when lawmakers do not share the con-
5
cerns of everyday Americans, their policies reflect 
6
that. 
7
(4) These circumstances have contributed to a 
8
Congress that does not always reflect everyday 
9
Americans. The New York Times reported in 2019 
10
that fewer than 5 percent of representatives cite 
11
blue-collar or service jobs in their biographies. A 
12
2015 survey by the Center for Responsive Politics 
13
showed that the median net worth of lawmakers was 
14
just over $1 million in 2013, or 18 times the wealth 
15
of the typical American household. 
16
(5) These circumstances have also contributed 
17
to a governing body that does not reflect the nation 
18
it serves. For instance, women are 51 percent of the 
19
American population. Yet even with a record number 
20
of women serving in the One Hundred Sixteenth 
21
Congress, the Pew Research Center notes that more 
22
than three out of four Members of this Congress are 
23
male. The Center for American Women And Politics 
24
found that one third of women legislators surveyed 
25
18:47 Jan 12, 2021

•HR 1 IH
had been actively discouraged from running for of-
1
fice, often by political professionals. This type of dis-
2
couragement, combined with the prohibitions on 
3
using campaign funds for domestic needs like 
4
childcare, burdens that still fall disproportionately 
5
on American women, particularly disadvantages 
6
working mothers. These barriers may explain why 
7
only 10 women in history have given birth while 
8
serving in Congress, in spite of the prevalence of 
9
working parents in other professions. Yet working 
10
mothers and fathers are best positioned to create 
11
policy that reflects the lived experience of most 
12
Americans. 
13
(6) Working mothers, those caring for their el-
14
derly parents, and young professionals who rely on 
15
their jobs for health insurance should have the free-
16
dom to run to serve the people of the United States. 
17
Their networks and net worth are simply not the 
18
best indicators of their strength as prospective pub-
19
lic servants. In fact, helping ordinary Americans to 
20
run may create better policy for all Americans. 
21
(c) PURPOSE.—It is the purpose of this subtitle to 
22
ensure that all Americans who are otherwise qualified to 
23
serve this Nation are able to run for office, regardless of 
24
their economic status. By expanding permissible uses of
