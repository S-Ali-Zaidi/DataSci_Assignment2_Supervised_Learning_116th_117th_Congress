RESOLUTION 
Remembering kindness in the United States and affirming 
our commitment to fostering community and building 
resiliency through every day acts of kindness. 
Whereas kindness means doing something for someone else 
with no expectation of anything in return; 
Whereas kindness can change a family, a neighborhood, a 
school, a city, a nation, and ultimately, our world; 
Whereas residents within the United States have a long his-
tory of demonstrating kindness daily in their homes, 
schools, places of faith, businesses, community organiza-
tions, and throughout their neighborhoods; 
Whereas kindness has the power to connect people and to 
build community and is the mortar that connects and 
builds the social infrastructure of the United States;

tackle the challenges that face the United States in a 
nonpartisan manner: Now, therefore, be it
