A BILL 
To amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to 
provide for the treatment of payments for child care 
and other personal use services as an authorized cam-
paign expenditure, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; PURPOSE.

(a) SHORT TITLE.—This Act may be cited as the 
4
‘‘Help America Run Act’’. 
5
(b) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:

(1) Everyday Americans experience barriers to 
1
entry before they can consider running for office to 
2
serve their communities. 
3
(2) Current law states that campaign funds 
4
cannot be spent on everyday expenses that would 
5
exist whether or not a candidate were running for 
6
office, like rent and food. While the law seems neu-
7
tral, its actual effect is to privilege the independently 
8
wealthy who want to run, because given the de-
9
mands of running for office, candidates who must 
10
work to pay for childcare or to afford health insur-
11
ance are effectively being left out of the process, 
12
even if they have sufficient support to mount a via-
13
ble campaign. 
14
(3) Thus current practice favors those prospec-
15
tive candidates who do not need to rely on a regular 
16
paycheck to make ends meet. The consequence is 
17
that everyday Americans who have firsthand knowl-
18
edge of the importance of stable childcare, a safety 
19
net, or great public schools are less likely to get a 
20
seat at the table. This governance by the few is anti-
21
thetical to the democratic experiment, but most im-
22
portantly, when lawmakers do not share the con-
23
cerns of everyday Americans, their policies reflect 
24
that.

(4) These circumstances have contributed to a 
1
Congress that does not always reflect everyday 
2
Americans. The New York Times reported in 2019 
3
that fewer than 5 percent of representatives cite 
4
blue-collar or service jobs in their biographies. A 
5
2015 survey by the Center for Responsive Politics 
6
showed that the median net worth of lawmakers was 
7
just over $1 million in 2013, or 18 times the wealth 
8
of the typical American household. 
9
(5) These circumstances have also contributed 
10
to a governing body that does not reflect the Nation 
11
it serves. For instance, women are 51 percent of the 
12
American population. Yet even with a record number 
13
of women serving in the One Hundred Sixteenth 
14
Congress, the Pew Research Center notes that more 
15
than three out of four Members of this Congress are 
16
male. The Center for American Women And Politics 
17
found that one-third of women legislators surveyed 
18
had been actively discouraged from running for of-
19
fice, often by political professionals. This type of dis-
20
couragement, combined with the prohibitions on 
21
using campaign funds for domestic needs like 
22
childcare, burdens that still fall disproportionately 
23
on American women, particularly disadvantages 
24
working mothers. These barriers may explain why 
25

•HR 1515 IH
only 10 women in history have given birth while 
1
serving in Congress, in spite of the prevalence of 
2
working parents in other professions. Yet working 
3
mothers and fathers are best positioned to create 
4
policy that reflects the lived experience of most 
5
Americans. 
6
(6) Working mothers, those caring for their el-
7
derly parents, and young professionals who rely on 
8
their jobs for health insurance should have the free-
9
dom to run to serve the people of the United States. 
10
Their networks and net worth are simply not the 
11
best indicators of their strength as prospective pub-
12
lic servants. In fact, helping ordinary Americans to 
13
run may create better policy for all Americans. 
14
(c) PURPOSE.—It is the purpose of this Act to ensure 
15
that all Americans who are otherwise qualified to serve 
16
this Nation are able to run for office, regardless of their 
17
economic status. By expanding permissible uses of cam-
18
paign funds and providing modest assurance that testing 
19
a run for office will not cost one’s livelihood, the Help 
20
America Run Act will facilitate the candidacy of represent-
21
atives who more accurately reflect the experiences, chal-
22
lenges, and ideals of everyday Americans.
