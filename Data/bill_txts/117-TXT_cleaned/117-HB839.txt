SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) A free and independent press is necessary 
3
for citizens to make informed choices on issues of 
4
public concern, to have the information necessary to 
5
recognize truth from falsehood, and to hold the pow-
6
erful and government officials to account. 
7
(2) As reflected in the First Amendment to the 
8
United States Constitution, a free press is essential 
9
to safeguard democracy. 
10
(3) The suppression of the press is historically 
11
associated with authoritarian rule. 
12
(4) As provided in Article 19 of the United Na-
13
tions Universal Declaration of Human Rights and 
14
the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
15
Rights, all people enjoy the right to freedom of opin-
16
ion and expression, which includes the right to seek, 
17
receive, and impart information. 
18
(5) An informed public is fundamental to a free 
19
society. 
20
(6) In accordance with a long United States 
21
history of championing freedom of the press around 
22
the globe, the Daniel Pearl Freedom of the Press 
23
Act of 2009 was enacted into law (Public Law 111– 
24
166).

(7) Since the passage of the Daniel Pearl Free-
1
dom of the Press Act of 2009, the global environ-
2
ment for a free and independent press has become 
3
more repressive. 
4
(8) According to 2020 data from the Committee 
5
to Protect Journalists, for the fifth consecutive year, 
6
at least 250 journalists were imprisoned globally in 
7
2020, and there was complete impunity in an esti-
8
mated 86 percent of cases of murdered journalists in 
9
the last decade. 
10
(9) According to 2019 data from Freedom 
11
House, in seven of the last 10 years, more countries 
12
have seen declines in press freedom scores than im-
13
provements. In the last five years, nearly 50 percent 
14
more countries have seen a net decline in press free-
15
dom. 
16
(10) According to 2019 data from Reporters 
17
Without Borders, 63 percent of the journalists killed 
18
last year were deliberately targeted and 59 percent 
19
were killed outside warzones. 
20
(11) In 2018, the brutal murder of Jamal 
21
Khashoggi at the hands of Saudi intelligence officers 
22
acting on explicit orders of the Saudi Government 
23
underscored the extent to which those in power will 
24
go to stifle the freedom of expression, silence their
