A BILL 
To ensure that the United States, States, and local govern-
ments are liable for monetary damages for constitutional 
violations by law enforcement officers. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Constitutional Ac-
4
countability Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) The 14th Amendment to the Constitution of 
8
the United States was passed by Congress and rati-

fied by the people of the United States against the 
1
backdrop of numerous State laws, policies, and prac-
2
tices that denied African Americans and others their 
3
enjoyment of fundamental rights. 
4
(2) Congress drafted the 14th Amendment to 
5
broadly protect fundamental rights and guarantee 
6
equality to all persons. 
7
(3) To help realize the promise of equality pro-
8
tected in the 14th Amendment, Congress passed sec-
9
tion 1979 of the Revised Statutes (42 U.S.C. 1983) 
10
(referred to in this section as ‘‘section 1983’’), cre-
11
ating a statutory remedy for violations of the Con-
12
stitution of the United States and Federal law. Ac-
13
cording to Mitchum v. Foster, 407 U.S. 225, 242 
14
(1972), section 1983 was intended ‘‘to interpose the 
15
Federal courts between the States and the people, as 
16
guardians of the people’s Federal rights’’. 
17
(4) By creating this remedy, Congress recog-
18
nized that civil suits are a necessary and powerful 
19
tool to protect individual rights. Suits under section 
20
1983 can not only make whole victims who are 
21
wronged. The suits can incentivize actors to take the 
22
steps necessary to avoid wrongdoing in the first 
23
place.

(5) Unfortunately, the Supreme Court’s current 
1
crabbed interpretation of section 1983 undermines 
2
its ability to accomplish these goals. 
3
(6) Private employers are responsible for the 
4
torts of their employees under the doctrine of 
5
respondeat superior. The risk of liability incentivizes 
6
private employers to effectively hire, supervise, train, 
7
and discipline their employees. 
8
(7) In contrast, under Monell v. Department of 
9
Social Services of the City of New York, 436 U.S. 
10
658 (1978), municipal defendants are not subject to 
11
respondeat superior liability for the constitutional 
12
torts of their officers. Cities may only be held liable 
13
for the constitutional torts of their officers only 
14
when the plaintiff can show that the violation was 
15
the result of a municipal policy or custom. Under 
16
Will v. Michigan Department of State Police, 491 
17
U.S. 58 (1989), States cannot be held liable at all. 
18
(8) The Monell doctrine requires judges to re-
19
solve difficult questions regarding which officials are 
20
policymakers, whether an official was acting in State 
21
or local capacity, and municipalities’ training and 
22
hiring processes.

(9) In Board of County Commissioners v. 
24
Brown, 520 U.S. 397, 430 (1997), Justice Breyer

•HR 6327 IH
criticized this ‘‘highly complex body of interpretive 
1
law’’ and called for a reexamination of ‘‘the legal 
2
soundness’’ of the Monell doctrine. Numerous schol-
3
ars, as well as other jurists, have criticized the 
4
Monell doctrine as convoluted, inconsistent, arbi-
5
trary, and unintelligible. 
6
(10) There is no statutory cause of action for 
7
constitutional violations by Federal officials. Victims 
8
can only bring their claims if courts infer a cause of 
9
action, which they are increasingly unlikely to do. 
10
(11) Police officers are regularly called upon to 
11
make split-second, life-or-death decisions. The cur-
12
rent liability regime, however, is not sufficient to en-
13
sure that police departments adequately hire, train, 
14
supervise, and discipline their officers so that they 
15
can respond to these situations in a constitutional 
16
manner. 
17
(12) There are over 18,000 police departments 
18
in the United States and no uniform standard on 
19
how officers should be trained. Departments gen-
20
erally require significantly more training on how to 
21
deploy force than when it is appropriate to do so. As 
22
recently as 2017, 34 States did not mandate de-es-
23
calation training for all officers.

(13) A National Public Radio study of fatal po-
1
lice shootings of unarmed Black people nationwide 
2
found that several officers were involved in multiple 
3
shootings without consequences. The same study 
4
found that departments hired officers with histories 
5
of domestic violence, as well as officers who were 
6
fired or forced out of other police departments due 
7
to prior misconduct. 
8
(14) According to United States v. Georgia, 
9
546 U.S. 151, 158 (2006), Congress has the power 
10
under section 5 of the 14th Amendment to the Con-
11
stitution of the United States to provide for direct 
12
enforcement of section 1 of the 14th Amendment 
13
‘‘by creating private remedies’’, including ones 
14
‘‘against the States’’. 
15
(15) Eliminating restrictions on the liability of 
16
State and local governments is necessary to ensure 
17
that no ‘‘State [shall] deprive any person of life, lib-
18
erty, or property, without due process of law; nor 
19
deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal 
20
protection of the laws’’.
