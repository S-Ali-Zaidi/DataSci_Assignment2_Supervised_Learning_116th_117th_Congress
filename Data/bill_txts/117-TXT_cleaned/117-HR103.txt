Whereas participants in the violent January 6, 2021, siege on 
the United States Capitol carried, wore, and displayed 
overt White supremacist slogans and symbols of QAnon, 
which the Federal Bureau of Investigation has labeled a 
domestic terror threat; 
Whereas the violent siege was in part organized by members 
of the Proud Boys, a group known to be Islamophobic, 
misogynist, nativist, and with ties to known anti-Semites, 
White supremacists, and conspiracy theorists; 
Whereas known White supremacists helped organize the riot 
and were visibly present among the group; 
Whereas the Federal Bureau of Investigation has reported 
that dozens of those who attended the siege are known 
White supremacists who are on a terrorist watchlist; 
Whereas visible in the crowd were Nazi flags, swastikas, and 
messages of Holocaust denial, including slogans like 
‘‘Work Brings Freedom’’, a phrase printed on the gates 
of the Nazi concentration camp in Auschwitz, and 
‘‘6MWE’’, which stands for ‘‘6 Million Wasn’t Enough’’, 
a reference to the 6,000,000 Jews murdered in the Holo-
caust; 
Whereas the Nazi swastika is a global symbol of hate, geno-
cide, and bigotry, and an anathema to democratic and 
free-thinking societies; 
Whereas rioters at the Capitol waved the racist and anti- 
American Confederate battle flag and carried it through 
the halls of the Capitol, something which Union soldiers 
fought and died to prevent; 
Whereas the Confederate battle flag, wielded by southern 
Dixiecrats to inflict terror, represents the ‘‘Lost Cause’’ 
myth, segregationists, and White nationalism, and con-

tinues to represent terrorism, violence, and the oppres-
sion of Black people; 
Whereas these symbols of oppression were visible in the 
crowd when they were addressed by then President Don-
ald Trump and Members of Congress; 
Whereas one of the Members of Congress who spoke to the 
crowd outside the Capitol said ‘‘Hitler was right on one 
thing . . .’’; 
Whereas Hitler was a mass murderer, propagandist, and dic-
tator who orchestrated the Holocaust; 
Whereas the seditionists who planned and participated in the 
attempted coup against the United States Government 
and the violent siege of the United States Capitol while 
carrying long guns, Molotov cocktails, explosive devices, 
and zip ties, were treated with more respect and less hos-
tility than the protesters who peacefully assembled to 
protest racial injustice in the plaza between St. John’s 
Church and Lafayette Square where they were tear 
gassed to create a path for then President Trump to take 
a staged photo at the church; 
Whereas despite early requests for additional reinforcements 
from the National Guard, the Trump administration re-
fused to approve the request while President Trump 
failed to condemn the terrorists storming the United 
States Capitol; 
Whereas, even after this group began acting violently, Presi-
dent Trump offered encouragement saying, ‘‘We love 
you’’; 
Whereas supporters of the seditionists have continued to 
argue that peaceful protesters of color and people of color

are a greater threat to our country than an armed siege 
of the United States Capitol; 
Whereas even after the siege, Senator Josh Hawley, Con-
gressman Mo Brooks, Congressman Paul Gosar, Con-
gresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, and Congress-
woman Lauren Boebert continued to support the 
seditionists who perpetrated this heinous and treasonous 
act; 
Whereas Senator Hawley and Congressman Brooks have 
compared peaceful protesters of color to terrorists and ri-
oters; 
Whereas Congressman Paul Gosar justified the murder of a 
peaceful Black Lives Matter protester as ‘‘self-defense’’ 
but has continued to support an armed attempted coup 
of the United States Government and has been accused 
of allegedly participating in planning the coup; 
Whereas Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene has said 
that Muslims do not belong in the government, has called 
Black voters ‘‘slaves’’, and continues to support baseless 
theories that the election was stolen; 
Whereas Congresswoman Lauren Boebert, during the debate 
on the second impeachment of Donald Trump, argued 
openly that peaceful protests for racial justice and demo-
cratic values are a greater threat to the United States 
than the seditionists that actively tried to overthrow the 
United States Government by stopping the peaceful tran-
sition of power through a premeditated, violent siege of 
the United States Capitol; 
Whereas Congressman Madison Cawthorn, who has implied 
in political communication that those who support the 
election of people of color ‘‘aim to ruin White males’’,

called upon the insurrectionists to ‘‘lightly threaten’’ 
their Congressperson and state ‘‘I’m coming after you’’ 
the morning of the riot and only expressed concern over 
the siege after receiving push back in his own district; 
Whereas Congresswoman Lauren Boebert supported the sedi-
tion and recklessly put her House colleagues in danger by 
posting a message on Twitter saying, ‘‘The Speaker has 
been removed from the chambers’’ as a pro-Trump mob 
breached the Capitol; 
Whereas certain Republican Members of Congress allegedly 
led a reconnaissance mission through the Capitol on Jan-
uary 5, the preceding day before insurrectionists took 
part in a deadly siege on the legislative branch; 
Whereas in advance of the Capitol riots the panic buttons in-
stalled in Representative Ayanna Pressley’s office to pro-
tect her and her staff were removed from her office with-
out her consent, thus putting her safety at risk; 
Whereas in the midst of a pandemic that has disproportion-
ately affected people of color because of long standing 
structural health and economic inequalities, several Re-
publican Members of Congress refused to take pre-
cautions against COVID–19 while in lockdown, which re-
sulted in multiple Members of Congress later testing 
positive for the coronavirus due to the negligence of their 
colleagues; 
Whereas more than a dozen Republican State and local law-
makers referred to the insurrectionists who stormed the 
Capitol as ‘‘patriots’’ and attended the Capitol insurrec-
tion that led to the death of at least 5 people including 
1 Capitol police officer;

•HRES 103 IH 
Whereas Republican National Committee members expressed 
their continued support for President Trump the morning 
after the Capitol riot occurred despite the fact that the 
insurrection left 5 dead and many more wounded due to 
the violence Donald Trump encouraged; 
Whereas Members of Congress and staff who identify as ra-
cial and religious minorities have expressed extreme dis-
tress and a decreased level of safety knowing that some 
of their colleagues aided in inciting the siege; 
Whereas people of color and religious minorities across the 
United States have expressed alarm and a decreased level 
of safety over the racial motivators of the siege on the 
Capitol; 
Whereas Joseph Biden and Kamala Harris, the first woman, 
Black, and Asian Vice President of the United States, in-
disputably won the 2020 election; 
Whereas that election was certified by a bipartisan vote of 
the House of Representatives and Senate; 
Whereas many Republican Members of Congress cast their 
votes to overturn the election results not out of genuine 
conviction, but for short-term political ambition and gain; 
Whereas Donald Trump has frequently used openly racist 
rhetoric and stoked fear and animosity against people of 
color and religious minorities while engaging with his 
supporters; and 
Whereas Donald Trump and the elected officials who support 
him spent the months following the election espousing 
unsubstantiated claims that the election was stolen: Now, 
therefore, be it
