•HR 6892 IH
(1) On February 24, 2022, Vladimir Putin 
1
launched a ‘‘special military operation’’ in Ukraine, 
2
and has since authorized hundreds of missile and ar-
3
tillery attacks against Ukraine and sent tens of 
4
thousands of Russian troops into Ukraine in an un-
5
lawful and unprovoked act of war. 
6
(2) On February 27, 2022, Vladimir Putin or-
7
dered his nuclear forces to be on high alert. 
8
(3) Conservative approximations estimate that 
9
hundreds of Ukrainians have been killed and thou-
10
sands wounded as a result of Russian attacks, and 
11
that more Ukrainians will die or be severely wound-
12
ed if Russia does not end its attack on Ukraine. 
13
(4) During ongoing Russian attacks on Ukrain-
14
ian soil, millions of Ukrainian citizens have had to 
15
seek shelter in their homes, bomb shelters, and sub-
16
way stations. 
17
(5) Due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, al-
18
most 900,000 Ukrainian refugees have already fled 
19
the country to neighboring countries, such as Po-
20
land, Hungary, and Slovakia. 
21
(6) It is estimated that there will be up to 4 
22
million refugees as a result of Russian attacks on 
23
Ukraine if the conflict continues to escalate.

(7) Russian airstrikes against Ukraine have se-
1
verely damaged residential buildings and key resi-
2
dential infrastructure in Ukraine, including major 
3
airports, a public square and opera house in 
4
Kharkiv, a hospital area in Vuhledar, and Kyiv’s 
5
main television tower, causing television broadcasts 
6
in Ukraine’s capital to temporarily cease. 
7
(8) On February 24, 2022, the U.N. Secretary 
8
General stated of the Russian invasion of Ukraine: 
9
‘‘The use of force by one country against another is 
10
the repudiation of the principles that every country 
11
has committed to uphold. . . . We know the toll of 
12
war. With deaths rising, we are seeing images of 
13
fear, anguish and terror in every corner of 
14
Ukraine.’’. 
15
(9) On February 24, 2022, the U.N. High 
16
Commissioner on Refugees stated of the Russian in-
17
vasion of Ukraine: ‘‘The humanitarian consequences 
18
on civilian populations will be devastating. There are 
19
no winners in war, but countless lives will be torn 
20
apart.’’. 
21
(10) On February 24, 2022, the UNICEF Ex-
22
ecutive Director stated of the Russian invasion of 
23
Ukraine: ‘‘UNICEF is deeply concerned that inten-
24
sifying hostilities in Ukraine pose an immediate 
25

threat to the lives and wellbeing of the country’s 7.5 
1
million children. Heavy weapons fire along the line 
2
of contact has already damaged critical water infra-
3
structure and education facilities in recent days. Un-
4
less the fighting subsides, tens of thousands of fami-
5
lies could be displaced, dramatically escalating hu-
6
manitarian needs.’’. 
7
(11) On February 26, 2022, the United Na-
8
tions Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian 
9
Affairs released their first report on the impact of 
10
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, noting that: ‘‘Signifi-
11
cant infrastructural damage has left hundreds of 
12
thousands of people without electricity or water, 
13
while bridges and roads damaged by shelling have 
14
left communities cut off from markets for food and 
15
other basic supplies.’’. 
16
(12) On February 24, 2022, the State Depart-
17
ment issued a Travel Advisory Level 4: Do Not 
18
Travel. This advisory read, in part: ‘‘Do not travel 
19
to Ukraine due to armed conflict and COVID-19. 
20
. . . On February 24, Russia’s forces attacked 
21
major Ukrainian cities, and the Ukrainian govern-
22
ment closed its airspace to commercial flights due to 
23
Russia’s military actions. . . . The security situation 
24
throughout Ukraine is highly volatile, and conditions 
25

may deteriorate without warning. U.S. citizens 
1
should remain vigilant and take appropriate steps to 
2
increase their security awareness. Know the location 
3
of your closest shelter or protected space. In the 
4
event of mortar and/or rocket fire, follow the in-
5
structions from local authorities and seek shelter im-
6
mediately. If you feel your current location is no 
7
longer safe, you should carefully assess the potential 
8
risks involved in moving to a different location.’’. 
9
(13) While United States policy advises Ameri-
10
cans that current conditions make it unsafe to travel 
11
to Ukraine, the same conditions make it dangerous 
12
and inappropriate to forcibly repatriate Ukrainians 
13
at this time. 
14
(14) Ukraine’s recent crisis and existing dan-
15
gers to anyone located in Ukraine, which have been 
16
recognized by domestic and international actors, 
17
clearly make Ukrainian nationals currently in the 
18
United States eligible for temporary protected status 
19
under subparagraphs (B) and (C) of sections 
20
244(b)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act 
21
(commonly known as ‘‘TPS’’). 
22
(15) There are more than 30,000 Ukrainian 
23
nationals residing in the United States who could 
24
00:34 Mar 09, 2022

6 
•HR 6892 IH
benefit from TPS designation during this ongoing 
1
conflict. 
2
(16) TPS grants temporary protection from de-
3
portation to nationals of a country in which environ-
4
mental or political events have occurred which make 
5
it temporarily unsafe to deport them. TPS has been 
6
granted to nationals of many countries due to ongo-
7
ing armed conflicts in these nationals’ home coun-
8
tries. 
9
(17) TPS is appropriate and necessary to grant 
10
to Ukrainians in the United States given the ongo-
11
ing violent conflict in Ukraine.
