SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The total amount of outstanding student 
3
loans just surpassed $1,500,000,000,000. 
4
(2) Student loans are the biggest category of 
5
consumer borrowing after mortgages. 
6
(3) Since the Consumer Financial Protection 
7
Act of 2010 (12 U.S.C. 5481 et seq.) established the 
8
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Bureau 
9
has fought to ensure families receive a fair shake as 
10
they strive for the American Dream. 
11
(4) The Consumer Financial Protection Act of 
12
2010 created a Student Loan Ombudsman at the 
13
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. In 2011, 
14
the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau estab-
15
lished an Office for Students and Young Consumers, 
16
led by the Student Loan Ombudsman, to assist stu-
17
dents who are mistreated or misled by predatory 
18
lenders. 
19
(5) Since its creation, the Office of Students 
20
and Young Consumers, led by the Student Loan 
21
Ombudsman, has defended military families in the 
22
United States from predatory lenders and for-profit 
23
colleges, and other unscrupulous businesses. 
24
(6) The Office of Students and Young Con-
25
sumers helped tens of thousands of active-duty mili-

tary service members who were being overcharged 
1
for student loans, and coordinating with the United 
2
States Justice Department, succeeded in returning 
3
$60,000,000 to the service members, and required 
4
the industry to improve its practices. 
5
(7) The Office of Students and Young Con-
6
sumers has collected and analyzed hundreds of thou-
7
sands of student complaints. 
8
(8) The Office of Students and Young Con-
9
sumers has recovered more than $750,000,000 on 
10
behalf of defrauded students. 
11
(9) The Office of Students and Young Con-
12
sumers has been instrumental in the shutdown of 
13
for-profit universities and colleges that had been ac-
14
cused of predatory practices. 
15
(10) The Office of Students and Young Con-
16
sumers collected data and authored a report that 
17
showed large banks overcharged college students fees 
18
that were higher than many of their competitors. 
19
The report remained unpublished by the Administra-
20
tion until a recent FOIA request opened it to the 
21
public. 
22
(11) The Department of Education Office of 
23
Inspector General released a concerning report on 
24
February 12, 2019, that highlighted the alarming
