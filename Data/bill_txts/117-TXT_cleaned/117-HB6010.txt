The Congress finds the following:

•HR 6010 IH
(1) The Davis-Bacon Act of 1931 (40 U.S.C. 
1
3141 et seq.) requires that contractors and sub-
2
contractors on certain government projects pay con-
3
struction workers locally prevailing wages as deter-
4
mined by the Department of Labor. 
5
(2) Locally prevailing wages vary by job classi-
6
fication and consist of a basic hourly rate of pay and 
7
benefits. 
8
(3) Generally, the Davis-Bacon Act applies to 
9
projects that meet the following three criteria: 
10
(A) There is a contract for construction in 
11
excess of $2,000. 
12
(B) The United States or the District of 
13
Columbia is a party to the contract. 
14
(C) The contract is for construction, alter-
15
ation, or repair of a public building or public 
16
work. 
17
(4) Under the Davis-Bacon Act, the Govern-
18
ment may terminate a contract if locally prevailing 
19
wages have not been paid to employees working on 
20
the project. 
21
(5) For 90 years, the Davis-Bacon Act has 
22
helped ensure quality craftsmanship on Federal 
23
projects, protected the standard of living of skilled 
24
and trained blue-collar construction workers, im-

proved workplace safety by discouraging ‘‘fly-by- 
1
night’’ contractors from bidding, incentivized work-
2
force training, and stimulated the economy. 
3
(6) The Wage and Hour Division of the De-
4
partment of Labor administers the Davis-Bacon Act 
5
by, among other things, determining prevailing wage 
6
rates and prescribing regulations and standards to 
7
be observed by contracting agencies. 
8
(7) Contracting agencies, such as the Corps of 
9
Engineers, however, have the primary day-to-day re-
10
sponsibility for enforcement of the Davis-Bacon Act 
11
and its labor standards requirements pursuant to 
12
subparts 22.406 and 22.407 of the Federal Acquisi-
13
tion Regulation and part 5 of title 29, Code of Fed-
14
eral Regulations and Reorganization Plan No. 14 of 
15
1950 (5 U.S.C. app.). 
16
(8) Some irresponsible contractors and sub-
17
contractors often avoid their prevailing wage obliga-
18
tions by, among other things, engaging in craft 
19
misclassification. 
20
(9) Craft misclassification refers to the practice 
21
in which contractors misclassify high-skilled workers 
22
as general laborers or other classifications in order 
23
to avoid paying the higher prevailing wage rate ap-
24
plicable to the high-skilled work actually performed.

•HR 6010 IH
(10) As part of the National Defense Author-
1
ization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 (Public Law 116– 
2
92), Congress directed the Comptroller General of 
3
the United States to conduct a study on the con-
4
tracting practices of the Army Corps of Engineers. 
5
(11) The Government Accountability Office 
6
(GAO) published their report on this study on 
7
March 10, 2021 with recommendations to the Army 
8
Corps of Engineers to ensures contractor employees 
9
are paid prevailing wages as required by the Davis- 
10
Bacon Act. 
11
(12) In their report, GAO found that from Fis-
12
cal Years 2015 to 2019, there were five times as 
13
many subcontractors, compared to prime contrac-
14
tors, found to be in violation of the Davis-Bacon 
15
Act. None were recommended to the Department of 
16
Labor for debarment from receiving future con-
17
tracts. 
18
(13) GAO found that the Army Corps of Engi-
19
neers Headquarters guidance to their 38 districts 
20
lacks sufficient information to ensure consistent 
21
monitoring of contractors’ compliance with the 
22
Davis-Bacon Act from one Army Corps district to 
23
the next.
