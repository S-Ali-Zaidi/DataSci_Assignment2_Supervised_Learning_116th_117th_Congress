A BILL 
To provide for security in the Black Sea region, and for 
other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Black Sea Security 
4
Act of 2022’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress makes the following findings: 
7
(1) The Black Sea region is of critical impor-
8
tance to the national security of six nations: 
9
01:26 Dec 22, 2022
H9511
2 
•HR 9511 IH
Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova, Romania, Bulgaria, and 
1
Turkey. 
2
(2) The Black Sea region has been a zone of in-
3
creasing tension and conflict on the eastern border 
4
of the European Union and the North Atlantic Trea-
5
ty Organization (NATO) following President Vladi-
6
mir Putin’s 2014 and 2022 invasions of Ukraine 
7
and 2008 invasion of Georgia, which still has terri-
8
tories illegally occupied by the Russian Federation. 
9
(3) Since the illegal attempted annexation of 
10
Ukraine’s Crimea region in 2014, the Russian Fed-
11
eration has enhanced the Black Sea Fleet to in-
12
crease its presence in the region, enhanced its air 
13
and coastal defenses, disregarded international law 
14
regarding freedom of navigation to interrupt in reg-
15
ular shipping routes, and threatened freedom of 
16
navigation exercises in the Black Sea. 
17
(4) Since its military interventions in the Black 
18
Sea region starting in 2008, the Russian Federation 
19
has undertaken persistent hybrid measures to fur-
20
ther destabilize the region through malign influence 
21
campaigns. 
22
(5) Since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine by the 
23
Russian Federation, the unity among Black Sea 
24
countries has strengthened, particularly among 
25
01:26 Dec 22, 2022
H9511
3 
•HR 9511 IH
NATO member countries Romania, Bulgaria, and 
1
Turkey. 
2
(6) The Russian Federation is leveraging its il-
3
legal claim over Black Sea waters and the territories 
4
of Black Sea region states to execute military exer-
5
cises to threaten the territorial sovereignty of 
6
Ukraine and kill innocent civilians. 
7
(7) Russia has a long history of using its posi-
8
tion in the Black Sea and Crimea to threaten NATO 
9
allies, including the HMS Defender incident of June 
10
2021, when a British ship was harassed by Russian 
11
ships while undertaking a freedom of navigation pa-
12
trol in waters near the Crimean Peninsula. 
13
(8) While NATO has conducted routine exer-
14
cises in the region, the United States presence in the 
15
Black Sea has decreased since Russia’s annexation 
16
of Crimea due to competing security priorities 
17
among allies, a lack of available ships and resources, 
18
and a lack of a clearly defined regional strategy. 
19
(9) While, in February 2022, Turkey blocked 
20
the entry of Russian warships into the Black Sea 
21
pursuant to the Convention regarding the Regime of 
22
the Straits, signed at Montreux, Switzerland July 
23
20, 1936 (commonly known as the ‘‘Montreux Con-
24
vention’’), the Montreux Convention does not ac-
25
01:26 Dec 22, 2022

•HR 9511 IH
count for the increase in size, weight, and capabili-
1
ties of modern warships, and Russia does not have 
2
the same limits on tonnage as non-littoral states. 
3
(10) Turkey has resisted attempts to change its 
4
interpretation of the Montreux Convention to avoid 
5
weakening their position in the region. 
6
(11) While NATO has long recognized the stra-
7
tegic importance of the Black Sea, Russia has 
8
sought to capitalize on at times divergent priorities 
9
among NATO members in the region to advance ex-
10
pansionist claims. 
11
(12) On February 24, 2022, Russian Federa-
12
tion 
President 
Vladimir 
Putin 
instigated 
an 
13
unprovoked, unjustified, and unlawful war violating 
14
the territorial integrity of the sovereign country of 
15
Ukraine and is using the Russian Federation’s mili-
16
tary presence on the Black Sea to kill innocent 
17
Ukrainian civilians. 
18
(13) The Russian Federation’s unprovoked war 
19
on Ukraine has underscored the importance of the 
20
Black Sea region to United States national security 
21
interests. 
22
(14) The Russian Federation’s unprovoked war 
23
has caused a food security crisis as 20,000,000– 
24
30,000,000 tons of Ukrainian grain remain unable 
25
01:26 Dec 22, 2022
H9511
5 
•HR 9511 IH
to leave Ukraine in an efficient and secure manner. 
1
The war has also impeded Ukraine’s ability to 
2
produce and transport next year’s harvest. 
3
(15) The Russian Federation’s actions in and 
4
around the Black Sea have also disrupted secure, re-
5
liable access to energy resources throughout Europe. 
6
Notably, Gazprom suspended natural gas supplies to 
7
Poland and Bulgaria on April 27, 2022, after the 
8
two countries refused to abide by a March 31, 2022, 
9
Russian decree that all payments be made in rubles, 
10
in violation of the terms of their contracts with 
11
Gazprom. 
12
(16) The People’s Republic of China (PRC)’s 
13
coercive economic policies also threaten the economic 
14
stability of the Black Sea region. 
15
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON BLACK SEA SECURITY. 
16
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
17
gress that— 
18
(1) it is in the interest of the United States to 
19
prevent the spread of further armed conflict in Eu-

21
arena of Russian aggression;

critical in countering aggression by the Government

of the Russian Federation and maintaining the col-
1
lective security of the NATO alliance; 
2
(3) the repeated, illegal, unprovoked, and vio-
3
lent attempts of the Russian Federation to expand 
4
its territory and control access to the Mediterranean 
5
through the Black Sea constitutes a threat to the 
6
national security of the United States and the 
7
NATO alliance; 
8
(4) the United States condemns attempts by 
9
the Russian Federation to change or alter bound-
10
aries in the Black Sea region by any means contrary 
11
to international law;

(5) the United States and its allies should 
13
robustly counter Russia’s illegal territorial claims on 
14
the Crimean Peninsula, along Ukraine’s territorial 
15
waters in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, in the 
16
Black Sea’s international waters, and in the terri-
17
tories it is illegally occupying in Ukraine; 
18
(6) the United States should continue to work 
19
within NATO and with NATO allies to develop a 
20
long-term strategy to enhance security, establish a 
21
permanent, sustainable presence in the eastern 
22
flank, and bolster the democratic resilience of its al-
23
lies and partners in the region;

H9511

•HR 9511 IH
(7) the United States should also work with the 
1
European Union in coordinating a strategy to sup-
2
port democratic initiatives and economic prosperity 
3
in the region, which includes two European Union 
4
members and four aspirant nations; 
5
(8) the United States should explore efforts to 
6
rebuild trust and bilateral relations with Turkey, a 
7
key ally in the Black Sea region and a bulwark 
8
against Iran; 
9
(9) it is in the interest of the United States 
10
that NATO adopt a robust strategy toward the 
11
Black Sea, including by working with interested 
12
partner countries in the region to advance common 
13
security objectives; 
14
(10) the United States should work to foster 
15
dialogue among countries within the Black Sea re-
16
gion to improve communication and intelligence 
17
sharing and increase cyber defense capabilities; 
18
(11) countries with historic and economic ties 
19
to Russia are looking to the United States and Eu-
20
rope to provide a positive economic presence in the 
21
broader region as a counterbalance to the Russian 
22
Federation’s malign influence in the region;

(12) it is in the interest of the United States 
1
to support and bolster the economic ties between the

United States and Black Sea partners;

(13) the United States should support the ini-
4
tiative undertaken by central and eastern European 
5
states to advance the Three Seas Initiative Fund to 
6
strengthen transport, energy, and digital infrastruc-
7
ture connectivity in the region between the Adriatic

10
for increased investment and economic expansion, 
11
particularly on energy, climate, and transport infra-
12
structure initiatives, between the United States and 
13
Black Sea states and the broader region; 
14
(15) improved economic ties between the United 
15
States and the Black Sea states and the broader re-
16
gion can lead to a strengthened strategic partner-
17
ship; 
18
(16) the United States must address the food 
19
security challenges arising from closure of Ukraine’s 
20
Black Sea ports, as this global challenge will have 
21
critical national security implications for the United 
22
States, our partners, and allies;

(17) Russia has a brutal history of using hun-
24
ger as a weapon and must be stopped; and
