•HR 3900 IH
age of 18, to permit the facilities of the person or organi-
1
zation to be used to perform any abortion on such a minor, 
2
or to assist in the performance of any abortion on such 
3
a minor if the person or organization has failed to comply 
4
with all of the following requirements: 
5
(1) The provision of written notification to the 
6
parents (as defined in subsection (e)) of the minor 
7
informing the parents that an abortion has been re-
8
quested for the minor, except that such notification 
9
is not required for a parent if the physician is pre-
10
sented with documentation showing with a reason-
11
able degree of certainty that a court of record in the 
12
minor’s State of residence has waived any parental 
13
notification. The court of record shall not waive any 
14
parental notification requirement unless there is 
15
clear and convincing evidence of physical abuse of 
16
the minor by such parent. 
17
(2) Compliance with a 96-hour waiting period 
18
after notice has been received by the parents. 
19
(3) Compliance with any injunction granted 
20
under section 3 relating to the abortion. 
21
(b) FINE FOR VIOLATION.—Whoever willfully violates 
22
subsection (a) shall be fined not more than $100,000 or 
23
imprisoned not more than one year, or both, for each viola-
24
tion.

(c) EXCEPTION.—Subsection (a) shall not apply with 
1
respect to an unemancipated minor for whom an abortion 
2
is sought if a physician (other than the physician with 
3
principal responsibility for making the decision to perform 
4
the abortion) makes a determination that— 
5
(1) a medical emergency exists which, with rea-
6
sonable medical certainty, so complicates the medical 
7
condition of the minor that the death of the minor 
8
would result from the failure to immediately treat 
9
her physical condition even though the treatment 
10
may result in the death of her unborn child; 
11
(2) parental notification is not possible as a re-
12
sult of the medical emergency; and 
13
(3) certifications regarding compliance with 
14
paragraphs (1) and (2) have been entered in the 
15
medical records of the minor, together with the rea-
16
sons upon which the determinations are based, in-
17
cluding a statement of relevant clinical findings. 
18
(d) PARENTAL NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS.—For 
19
purposes of this section, any parental notification provided 
20
to comply with the provisions of subsection (a) for a par-
21
ent shall be— 
22
(1) delivered personally to the parent; or 
23
(2) provided through certified mail in accord-
24
ance with all of the following procedures:

10
guardian of the minor.

SEC. 3. PARENTAL INTERVENTION. 
12
Any parent required to be notified pursuant to sec-
13
tion 2 regarding an abortion of an unemancipated minor 
14
may bring an action in the Federal district court where 
15
the parent resides or where the unemancipated minor is 
16
located to enjoin the performance of the abortion. The 
17
court shall issue a temporary injunction barring the per-
18
formance of the abortion until the issue has been adju-
19
dicated and the judgment is final. The court shall issue 
20
relief permanently enjoining the abortion unless the court 
21
determines that granting such relief would be unlawful. 
22
SEC. 4. PREEMPTION. 
23
Nothing in this Act shall be construed to preempt any 
24
provision of State law to the extent that such State law

tion thereof, is found unconstitutional, that finding shall
