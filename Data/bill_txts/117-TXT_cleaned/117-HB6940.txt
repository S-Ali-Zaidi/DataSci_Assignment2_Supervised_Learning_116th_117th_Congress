SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Israel Anti-Boycott 
2
Act’’. 
3
SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
4
It is the sense of Congress that— 
5
(1) the Government of the United States should 
6
use its voice, vote, and influence with and in inter-
7
national governmental organizations to actively op-
8
pose politically motivated actions to boycott, divest 
9
from, or sanction Israel; 
10
(2) the Government of the United States com-
11
bats anti-Israel boycotts and other discriminatory 
12
activity under the Export Control Reform Act of 
13
2018 (subtitle B of title XVII of Public Law 115– 
14
232), under part VI of title X of the Tax Reform 
15
Act of 1976 (Public Law 94–455; 90 Stat. 1649) 
16
(commonly referred to as the ‘‘Ribicoff Amend-
17
ment’’), through trade promotion authorities, in free 
18
trade agreements, and in accession negotiations to 
19
the World Trade Organization; however, due to the 
20
increased anti-Israel economic activity in inter-
21
national governmental organizations, it is necessary 
22
to update Federal authorities to combat anti-Israel 
23
boycotts and other discriminatory activity in such 
24
fora, including the United Nations Human Rights 
25
Council;

(3) actions to boycott, divest from, or sanction 
1
Israel represent a concerted effort to extract conces-
2
sions from Israel outside of direct negotiations be-
3
tween the Israelis and Palestinians; and 
4
(4) the United States-Israel Strategic Partner-
5
ship Act of 2014 (Public Law 113–296; 128 Stat. 
6
4075) should be fully implemented through en-
7
hanced, governmentwide, coordinated United States- 
8
Israel scientific and technological cooperation in ci-
9
vilian areas, such as with respect to energy, water, 
10
agriculture, alternative fuel technology, civilian space 
11
technology, and security in order to counter the ef-
12
fects of actions to boycott, divest from, or sanction 
13
Israel.
