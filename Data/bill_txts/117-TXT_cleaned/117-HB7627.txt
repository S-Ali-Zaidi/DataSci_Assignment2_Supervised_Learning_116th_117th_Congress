A BILL 
To address systemic racism through the arts and humanities 
in the United States. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Advancing Equity 
4
Through the Arts and Humanities Act of 2022’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress makes the following findings: 
7
(1) Access to the arts and cultural program-
8
ming influences positive social determinants and is 
9
integral to healthy communities.

(2) In America, the received narrative is that 
1
the arts are for entertainment or for artists, but a 
2
deeper look shows the profound effect access to the 
3
arts has on those most impacted by the justice sys-
4
tem, children, veterans, low-income communities, 
5
and self-designated non-artists. 
6
(3) Concentrated cultural districts are associ-
7
ated with reduced poverty without neighborhood dis-
8
placement, improved child welfare, and lower mor-
9
bidity. 
10
(4) Low-income neighborhoods with cultural re-
11
sources have 14 percent fewer cases of child abuse 
12
and neglect, and 18 percent less serious crime than 
13
low-income neighborhoods without cultural re-
14
sources. 
15
(5) Low-income students who participate in the 
16
arts, both in school and after school, have a dropout 
17
rate of just 4 percent or 5 times lower than their 
18
peers. Children with access to arts programming in 
19
schools showed a 22.55 percent improvement in 
20
math proficiency, a 12.62 percent improvement in 
21
reading, and suspensions were reduced by as much 
22
as 89 percent. 
23
(6) Seventy-one percent of at-risk students with 
24
high arts involvement attend college, whereas only 
25
18:03 May 18, 2022
H7627
3 
•HR 7627 IH
48 percent of at-risk students with low arts involve-
1
ment attend college. 
2
(7) Participation in after-school arts programs 
3
causes juvenile crime to fall by 4.2 percent on aver-
4
age, and slightly more (5.4 percent) in lower-income 
5
cities. 
6
(8) Arts programming in prisons showed an 89- 
7
percent drop in infractions. 
8
(9) The cultural economy is significant not only 
9
in cities, but also in rural and tribal communities. 
10
Forty percent of Native American households on the 
11
Pine Ridge Reservation in Kyle, South Dakota, de-
12
pend on home-based arts enterprises. 
13
(10) The arts heal the mental, physical, and 
14
moral injuries of war for military servicemembers 
15
and veterans, as well as aid in their reintegration 
16
into the community. 
17
(11) Arts and culture is an $878,000,000,000 
18
industry in the U.S. (nonprofit, commercial, edu-
19
cation). The nonprofit arts industry alone generates 
20
$166,300,000,000 in annual economic activity 
21
spending by organizations and their audience, which 
22
supports 
4,600,000 
jobs 
and 
generates 
23
$27,500,000,000 in government revenue.

(12) The National Endowment for the Arts is 
1
the only arts funder in the United States, public or 
2
private, that provides access to the arts in all 50 
3
States, the District of Columbia, and territories of 
4
the United States. 
5
(13) Many of the most far-reaching victories for 
6
racial healing in the United States have been greatly 
7
enhanced by the involvement, support, and dedica-
8
tion of individuals from any and all racial groups. 
9
(14) At the same time, much of the progress to-
10
ward racial healing and racial equity in the United 
11
States has been limited or reversed by our failure to 
12
address the root cause of racism, the belief in the 
13
myth of a hierarchy of human value based on super-
14
ficial physical characteristics such as skin color and 
15
facial features. 
16
(15) Limited arts access is linked to economic 
17
and racial inequities as well as resource deprivation. 
18
(16) Arts organizations serving communities of 
19
color are, in general, much less financially secure 
20
and far smaller than their counterparts in White 
21
communities. The median budgets of the 20 largest 
22
arts organizations serving communities of color in a 
23
given discipline, such as dance, theater, or music, 
24
18:03 May 18, 2022
H7627

•HR 7627 IH
were more than 90 percent smaller than the budgets 
1
of the largest organizations in that discipline. 
2
(17) Children of color, who make up the over-
3
whelming percentage of the children living in poverty 
4
in the United States, and other students with lower 
5
socioeconomic status, have a lower probability of ac-
6
cessing arts education. 
7
(18) Access to arts education declined signifi-
8
cantly more for Black and Brown students than it 
9
did for White children between 1982 and 2008. 
10
There was less than a 2 percent decrease for White 
11
children, while there was a 49 percent decrease for 
12
Black children and a 40 percent decrease for Latin 
13
children. 
14
(19) The arts are in everyone. Everyone should 
15
have access to the arts. 
16
(20) Racial and ethnic inequality is a result of 
17
systematic and internalized racism and racist public 
18
and private policies and practices. Dismantling 
19
structural racism through the arts and humanities is 
20
critical to the health of our Nation.
