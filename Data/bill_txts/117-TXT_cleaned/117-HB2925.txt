tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

Congress makes the following findings:

•HR 2925 IH
(1) The Federal Government has intentionally 
1
separated and detained families seeking asylum in 
2
the United States purportedly to deter other foreign 
3
nationals from coming to the United States in the 
4
future. Such method of deterrence is ineffective, con-
5
trary to human rights norms, and likely violates 
6
United States and international law. 
7
(2) On September 7, 2018, the Secretary of 
8
Homeland Security issued a proposed rule entitled 
9
‘‘Apprehension, Processing, Care, and Custody of 
10
Alien Minors and Unaccompanied Alien Children’’ 
11
(83 Fed. Reg. 45486 (September 7, 2018)) that at-
12
tempted to circumvent a 1997 court agreement com-
13
monly known as the ‘‘Flores Settlement Agreement’’ 
14
to undermine current legal protections for children 
15
and families and increase family detention. 
16
(3) Detaining families can have long-term con-
17
sequences on children, such as— 
18
(A) difficulty regulating emotions, achiev-
19
ing developmental milestones, and forming 
20
healthy relationships; 
21
(B) increased rates of anxiety, depression, 
22
and post-traumatic stress disorder; and 
23
(C) heightened risks of suicide and self- 
24
harm.

•HR 2925 IH
(4) When family units are placed in family de-
1
tention facilities— 
2
(A) family members experience feelings of 
3
isolation and increased stress; 
4
(B) the ability of the parents to care for 
5
their children is compromised by the constraints 
6
of detention; and 
7
(C) the detention setting creates barriers 
8
to— 
9
(i) accessing counsel and legal serv-
10
ices; and 
11
(ii) successfully obtaining relief from 
12
removal. 
13
(5) Nondetention-based practices, such as fam-
14
ily case management and community-based pro-
15
grams, are effective and humane alternatives to fam-
16
ily detention.
