technologies, and modern information and commu-
1
nication systems have transformed the way people in 
2
the United States work, live, and interact. 
3
(2) The United States must establish policies 
4
and create programs capable of responding to chang-
5
ing economic realities. 
6
(3) The United States must develop strategies 
7
to maximize current assets and help grow a United 
8
States economy and workforce that can thrive in a 
9
challenging environment of constant change and re-
10
invention. 
11
(4) The Nation needs to strengthen and im-
12
prove Federal support for a Next Generation econ-
13
omy and workforce. 
14
(5) The United States must explore sustainable 
15
strategies to create jobs that will endure, will remain 
16
reliant on a local workforce, and are unlikely to 
17
move overseas. 
18
(6) There is great value and untapped potential 
19
in the Nation’s rich history, the creative freedoms 
20
enjoyed by its people, and the many cultures and 
21
traditions that make the United States so unique. 
22
(7) Promoting local arts and enhancing the cre-
23
ative economy of the United States would support 
24
the Nation’s diverse citizenry, rich traditions, and 
25

vast creative talents, including the unique history 
1
and continuing vitality of Native American commu-
2
nities. 
3
(8) The United States must embrace the oppor-
4
tunities and challenges the country faces and re-
5
imagine the role of the Federal Government in pro-
6
viding support for local arts activity and expanding 
7
the creative economy. 
8
(9) The United States needs to engage workers 
9
from around the Nation to develop, hone, and share 
10
expressions of their cultural heritage, including lan-
11
guages, creative collaborations, and artistic skills. 
12
(10) The Nation needs to recognize that there 
13
is a broad range of undervalued and underutilized 
14
human potential in the United States, and the exist-
15
ence of that human potential has profound social, 
16
economic, and workforce ramifications. 
17
(11) Securing the future well-being of individ-
18
uals, families, communities, and the Nation will de-
19
pend in part on adopting Federal policies that will 
20
increase support for the creative economy. 
21
(12) The Nation needs to improve creative 
22
workforce readiness and develop an education and 
23
job training plan, including a plan for education and 
24
training through specialized vocational schools and 
25

apprenticeship programs, to ensure that individuals 
1
of all ages in the United States can realize their full 
2
creative potential now and in the future. 
3
(13) Investing in a creative economy workforce 
4
would help showcase the Nation’s creative arts, 
5
strengthen its capacity for job growth, promote eco-
6
nomic inclusion, boost entrepreneurship, improve 
7
and revitalize rural, remote, and underserved areas, 
8
and empower communities to share their stories.
