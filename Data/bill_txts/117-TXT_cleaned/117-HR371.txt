icy and other understandings ensuring Taiwan’s security

democratic interests of the United States in the Indo-Pa-
cific region; 
Whereas Taiwan continues to embody and promote demo-
cratic values, freedom, and human rights within the is-
land and throughout the surrounding region; 
Whereas trade between the United States and Taiwan con-
tributes meaningfully to our mutual economic growth; 
Whereas Taiwan implemented rapid, restrained, and effective 
policies that successfully mitigated the impacts of 
COVID–19 on the island and also played a significant 
role in distributing personal protective equipment and 
other important resources internationally to bolster other 
countries’ efforts to combat the spread of the novel 
coronavirus, despite being cut off from international 
health organizations and other fora by the People’s Re-
public of China; 
Whereas the People’s Liberation Army of China has engaged 
in deeply concerning military activities in Taiwanese 
waters and airspace that threaten the maintenance of 
peaceful cross-strait relations;

rhetoric and actions an openness to the forceful reunifica-

bility and security; 
Whereas Chinese President Xi Jinping’s efforts to establish 
a ‘‘Great Rejuvenation of the Chinese Nation’’ through 
policies that mandate national uniformity and assimila-
tion to ‘‘Xi Jinping Thought’’ erodes natural human dif-
ferences and human flourishing and have been the ideo-
logical catalyst for many of China’s malevolent activities; 
Whereas former Secretary of State Michael Pompeo and cur-
rent Secretary of State Antony Blinken have determined 
that the Communist government of China is actively im-
plementing a policy of genocide and crimes against hu-
manity against Uyghur and other ethnic minority groups 
in Xinjiang; 
Whereas the central government of China and party 
apparatchiks in Hong Kong have fundamentally annihi-
lated Hong Kong’s democratic system, as well as its peo-
ple’s civic and political freedoms, flagrantly violating the 
terms of the Sino-British Joint Declaration; 
Whereas under China’s Law on Safeguarding National Secu-
rity in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, 
passed on June 30, 2020, Chinese officials have mass ar-
rested pro-democracy leaders, democratically elected offi-
cials to the Legislative Council, those seeking to escape 
China’s oppressive grip over Hong Kong, and anyone who 
dares to oppose or criticize the Communist Party of 
China, and denied these individuals access to legal coun-
sel and of their legal rights guaranteed under Chinese 
and Hong Kong law; 
Whereas the Chinese Government has established a consistent 
pattern of violating freedom of navigation and inter-

in contravention of the UN Convention on the Law of the 
Sea tribunal’s ruling against China’s expansionist activi-
ties there; 
Whereas since 1997, the Chinese Communist Party has se-
verely persecuted Falun Gong practitioners and those 
who are sympathetic to Falun Dafa, including subjecting 
these individuals to forced organ harvesting, physical 
abuse, torture, arbitrary detainment, and other forms of 
discrimination and persecution; and 
Whereas the United States remains committed to supporting 
Taiwan through legally permissible means, including 
through diplomatic, educational, and military exchanges:
