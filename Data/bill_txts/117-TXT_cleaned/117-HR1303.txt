RESOLUTION 
Establishing the Marxist roots of critical race theory and 
detail the threat this divisive ideology poses to the Amer-
ican republic. 
Whereas critical race theory is a newly prominent vein of 
thought that has arisen in the United States with the 
purpose of calling into question the founding and moral 
legitimacy of the United States, both here and through-
out the world, and is for many reasons a pressing issue 
of debate for the American people; 
Whereas critical race theory identifies a special kind of prop-
erty, ‘‘whiteness’’, created by White people originally

from Europe in order to grant themselves power and 
privilege while excluding other racial groups from ‘‘white-
ness’’ and its putative benefits; 
Whereas critical race theory teaches children that they are ei-
ther oppressors or oppressed based solely on the color of 
their skin; 
Whereas critical race theory accordingly claims to identify a 
racial stratification of American society and its institu-
tions created by access to and exclusion from ‘‘whiteness’’ 
as a specialized form of racial property that confers social 
capital upon those with access to it; 
Whereas critical race theory designates as ‘‘privileged’’ those 
granted access to ‘‘whiteness’’, contends that this ‘‘white 
privileged’’ status is maintained by an ideological com-
mitment to what it calls ‘‘white supremacy’’, by which it 
means maintenance of this form of racial ‘‘property’’ and 
the capacity to exclude certain people from it, and thus 
establishes therein a racial hierarchy within the United 
States; 
Whereas critical race theory frames the alleged racial-class 
stratification of American society as racial-class antag-
onism across this line of stratification; 
Whereas critical race theory explicitly frames this racial-class 
antagonism as structural in nature under the terms 
‘‘structural racism’’ and ‘‘systemic racism’’, sees it as 
structurally determinant upon the character of United 
States citizens, and defines it in terms of a structural di-
alectic analogous to Karl Marx’s doctrines of structural 
classism, material determinism, and dialectical mate-
rialism;

Whereas critical race theory claims that ‘‘structural racism’’ 
is the fundamental organizing principle of United States 
society and its ‘‘ordinary state of affairs’’, thus framing 
the United States as an intrinsically unjust, oppressive, 
and racist nation, and this being in direct analogy to 
Karl Marx’s views on the structural nature of capitalism, 
which was his caricature of the free-market principles 
that underlie United States society, especially inalienable 
property rights; 
Whereas critical race theory contends that its purpose is to 
awaken a racial-class consciousness pursuant to, in its 
own defining words, ‘‘calling into question the very foun-
dations of the liberal order, including equality theory, 
legal reasoning, Enlightenment rationalism, and the neu-
tral principles of constitutional law’’; 
Whereas critical race theorists consider themselves ‘‘highly 
suspicious of . . . rights’’ and thus set themselves in op-
position to the Declaration of Independence, the Con-
stitution, the American founding ideals of inalienable 
rights secured by a government, and the social fabric of 
the American Republic; 
Whereas critical race theory, in its own words, ‘‘contains an 
activist dimension’’ such that ‘‘it not only tries to under-
stand our social situation, but to change it; it sets out 
not only to ascertain how society organizes itself along 
racial lines and hierarchies, but to transform it for the 
better’’, and thereby affirms the dialectical conception of 
the world and man’s role in it put forth by Karl Marx 
in such a way that its implementation by the government 
threatens to violate of the Establishment Clause of the 
First Amendment;

•HRES 1303 IH 
Whereas critical race theory claims that the only solution to 
this state of affairs is to ‘‘abolish whiteness’’, explicitly 
eschewing ‘‘incremental and step-by-step progress’’, in 
perfect analogy to Karl Marx’s demand in the ‘‘Com-
munist Manifesto’’ to abolish bourgeois private property, 
with this being the clearly stated purpose of raising the 
racial consciousness; 
Whereas certain prominent advocates of critical race theory 
have publicly called for the principles of critical race the-
ory to be insinuated not only into all vital and secondary 
American institutions and businesses under terms with 
deceptive specialist definitions, including ‘‘diversity’’, ‘‘eq-
uity’’, ‘‘inclusion’’, and ‘‘antiracism’’, but also into the 
United States Government with power over all public pol-
icy on the local, State, and Federal level, in effect estab-
lishing a ‘‘dictatorship of the antiracists’’ analogous to 
the Marxist vanguard concept of a ‘‘dictatorship of the 
proletariat’’ and inimical to the American way of life and 
republican form of government; 
Whereas the creators of critical race theory openly describe 
themselves as Marxists and recognizing that critical race 
theory is the primary tool of the twentieth century move-
ment called ‘‘Critical Marxism’’; 
Whereas prominent critical race theorists have explicitly de-
clared that the only remedy to past discrimination is 
present and future discrimination in the reverse direction 
to the ‘‘structural racism’’ from those with access to 
‘‘whiteness’’ to those allegedly excluded from it, in viola-
tion of the Fourteenth Amendment and its equal protec-
tion clause; 
Whereas critical race theory therefore not only calls for illegal 
racial discrimination and ‘‘structurally determined’’ racial

stereotyping but also leads to the racial scapegoating of 
‘‘whiteness’’ and those who allegedly have access to it; 
and 
Whereas the response from critical race theorists to this reso-
lution will be to accuse this resolution, its authors, and 
its supporters of malicious and racist intent: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—

danger to the Republic, its citizens, and the States,
