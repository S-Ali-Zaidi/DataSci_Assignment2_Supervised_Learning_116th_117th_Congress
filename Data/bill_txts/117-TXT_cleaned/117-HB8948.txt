‘‘(1) youth who have become homeless or who

permission are at risk of developing, and have a dis-

4

5
emotional challenges because they lack sufficient re-

sources to obtain care and may live on the street for

extended periods of time, thereby endangering them-

‘‘(2) many such young people, because of their 
10
age and situation, are urgently in need of temporary 
11
shelter and services, including services that consider 
12
their age, gender, and social and developmental 
13
needs, are culturally and linguistically appropriate, 
14
and acknowledge the environment of youth seeking 
15
these services; 
16
‘‘(3) research has documented the fluid experi-
17
ences of homelessness of youth, where many youth 
18
experience 2 or more different types of homeless-
19
ness, including couch surfing, living in motels, and 
20
staying on the streets;

veloped and provided using a positive youth develop-
8

19
problem, it is the responsibility of the Federal Gov-
20

21
system to report the prevalence of youth homeless-

‘‘(8) improved coordination and collaboration at 
13
the Federal level between programs that serve run-
14
away and homeless youth are necessary for the de-
15
velopment of a long-term strategy for responding to 
16
the needs of this population; 
17
‘‘(9) runaway and homeless youth are at a high 
18
risk of substance use disorders and becoming victims 
19
of sexual exploitation and trafficking; 
20
‘‘(10) since research has shown that the preva-
21
lence of homelessness among youth is similar in 
22
rural and urban communities, runaway and homeless 
23
youth programs, such as those funded under this 
24
title, are integral services that every community
