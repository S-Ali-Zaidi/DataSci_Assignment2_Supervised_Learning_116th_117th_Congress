SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Marijuana Opportunity 
2
Reinvestment and Expungement Act of 2021’’ or the 
3
‘‘MORE Act of 2021’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
5
The Congress finds as follows: 
6
(1) The communities that have been most 
7
harmed by cannabis prohibition are benefiting the 
8
least from the legal marijuana marketplace. 
9
(2) A legacy of racial and ethnic injustices, 
10
compounded by the disproportionate collateral con-
11
sequences of 80 years of cannabis prohibition en-
12
forcement, now limits participation in the industry. 
13
(3) 37 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto 
14
Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands have 
15
adopted laws allowing legal access to cannabis, and 
16
15 States, the District of Columbia, the Common-
17
wealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam 
18
have adopted laws legalizing cannabis for adult rec-
19
reational use. 
20
(4) A total of 47 States have reformed their 
21
laws pertaining to cannabis despite the Schedule I 
22
status of marijuana and its Federal criminalization. 
23
(5) 
Legal 
cannabis 
sales 
totaled 
24
$20,000,000,000 in 2020 and are projected to reach 
25
$40,500,000,000 by 2025.

•HR 3617 IH
(6) According to the American Civil Liberties 
1
Union (ACLU), enforcing cannabis prohibition laws 
2
costs taxpayers approximately $3.6 billion a year. 
3
(7) The continued enforcement of cannabis pro-
4
hibition laws results in over 600,000 arrests annu-
5
ally, disproportionately impacting people of color 
6
who are almost 4 times more likely to be arrested 
7
for cannabis possession than their White counter-
8
parts, despite equal rates of use across populations. 
9
(8) People of color have been historically tar-
10
geted by discriminatory sentencing practices result-
11
ing in Black men receiving drug sentences that are 
12
13.1 percent longer than sentences imposed for 
13
White men and Latinos being nearly 6.5 times more 
14
likely to receive a Federal sentence for cannabis pos-
15
session than non-Hispanic Whites. 
16
(9) In 2013, simple cannabis possession was the 
17
fourth most common cause of deportation for any of-
18
fense and the most common cause of deportation for 
19
drug law violations. 
20
(10) Fewer than one-fifth of cannabis business 
21
owners identify as minorities and only approximately 
22
4 percent are black. 
23
(11) Applicants for cannabis licenses are lim-
24
ited by numerous laws, regulations, and exorbitant 
25
06:18 Jul 03, 2021
H3617
4 
•HR 3617 IH
permit applications, licensing fees, and costs in these 
1
States, which can require more than $700,000. 
2
(12) Historically disproportionate arrest and 
3
conviction rates make it particularly difficult for 
4
people of color to enter the legal cannabis market-
5
place, as most States bar these individuals from par-
6
ticipating. 
7
(13) Federal law severely limits access to loans 
8
and capital for cannabis businesses, disproportion-
9
ately impacting minority small business owners. 
10
(14) Some States and municipalities have taken 
11
proactive steps to mitigate inequalities in the legal 
12
cannabis marketplace and ensure equal participation 
13
in the industry.
