RESOLUTION 
Opposing engaging Russia for reviving any form of the Joint 
Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) with Iran, op-

support of terrorist activities remains unchanged, oppos-
ing restoring any form of the JCPOA while the issue

of Iran’s undeclared nuclear activities remains unre-
solved. 
Whereas Russian President Putin bombards Ukrainian cities, 
intentionally targeting civilians, and the Biden adminis-
tration continues to partner with Russian diplomats to 
negotiate a return to a lesser and worse form of the 
failed JCPOA, giving billions of dollars in sanctions relief 
to the world’s worst state sponsor of terrorism; 
Whereas guidance sent out by the Department of State call-
ing for isolating Russia makes an explicit exception for 
talks to revive the failed Iran nuclear deal; 
Whereas involving Russia in negotiating a new Iran deal only 
helps and strengthens Russia; 
Whereas Russia demands for a guarantee from the United 
States that sanctions imposed over the Ukraine crisis 
would not affect Russia’s trade with Iran; 
Whereas, under a Russia-facilitated new deal— 
(1) Russia may be in a position to strengthen its 
power base in the Middle East; 
(2) assist Iran in threatening the United States and 
our allies through nuclear extortion; 
(3) the financial gain funneled through Russia’s 
arms sales to Iran can be used to fund Russia’s ongoing 
and future aggression; and 
(4) Russia is seeking to use Iran as a sanctions- 
busting loophole to offset the costs of sanctions due to its 
invasion of Ukraine; 
Whereas the Islamic Republic of Iran has been designated a 
‘‘State Sponsor of Terrorism’’ since 1984 by the Depart-
ment of State, and remains the world’s leading state 
sponsor of terrorism to this day;

Whereas there have been extremely concerning recent reports 
indicating that the Biden administration seeks to lift 
nonnuclear sanctions on Iran’s Supreme Leader’s Office, 
the Leader’s network of appointees, as well as on some 
of Iran’s worst human rights abusers, torturers, and ter-
rorists; 
Whereas among the most notorious whose sanctions would be 
removed are— 
(1) former Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Gen-
eral, Hossein Dehghan, who was involved in the 1983 
Beirut barracks bombing that killed 241 United States 
Marines; 
(2) Iran’s President, Ebrahim Raisi, who is respon-
sible for enforced disappearance and torture of thousands 
of Iranians; and 
(3) Iran’s Vice President, Mohsen Rezaei, who is on 
INTERPOL Red Notice for his role in the AMIA bomb-
ing in Argentina in 1994 that killed 85 people; 
Whereas lifting, waiving, or otherwise weakening sanctions on 
Iran related to terrorism while Iran continues to sponsor 
terrorism will only provide the Iranian regime and terror-
ists supported by it access to the United States financial 
system and endanger United States national security; 
Whereas the Biden administration claims that restoring the 
nuclear deal with Iran would prevent Iran from devel-
oping a nuclear-weapons capability; 
Whereas any nuclear agreement with Iran that is not pre-
mised on a complete and fully verified declaration of 
Iran’s past and present nuclear activities could never 
achieve that goal;

Whereas such a deal would significantly weaken the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty; and 
Whereas the Biden administration concludes a new nuclear 
agreement with Iran, it has shown a distaste for both 
diplomatic and economic pressure against the Iranian re-
gime, allowing Tehran to accrue more revenue through il-
licit oil sales and have a freer hand with added resources 
to destabilize the region: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) rejects and opposes engaging Russia as a 
2
main intermediary for reviving any nuclear agree-
3
ment with Iran as defined by the Iran Nuclear 
4
Agreement Review Act (INARA); 
5
(2) rejects and opposes giving Russia any sanc-
6
tions exemption or waiver as a condition to any nu-
7
clear agreement with Iran as defined by INARA; 
8
(3) rejects and opposes any agreement that lifts 
9
sanctions on Iran and legitimizes the regime’s illicit 
10
nuclear program amidst an International Atomic 
11
Energy Agency investigation into undeclared sites, 
12
facilities, and material in Iran; 
13
(4) reaffirms that any nuclear deal with Iran 
14
reached by the Biden administration without con-
15
gressional approval or Senate ratification as a treaty 
16
is illegitimate; 
17
(5) reaffirms to take every legislative oppor-
18
tunity to overturn such an agreement;

restrictive measure, designation, waiver, or general

license the Biden administration removes;

(7) reaffirms to limit the Biden administra-
4
tion’s or any future administration’s ability to issue

or restrictive measures; and

(8) reaffirms that any nuclear agreement with

Iran will not prevent the Congress from standing

nonnuclear threats, which include terrorism, weap-
