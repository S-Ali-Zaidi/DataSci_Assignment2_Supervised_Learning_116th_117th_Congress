RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the designation of September 2021 
as ‘‘National Brain Aneurysm Awareness Month’’. 
Whereas an unruptured brain aneurysm can lead to double 
vision, vision loss, loss of sensation, weakness, loss of bal-
ance, uncoordination, and speech problems; 
Whereas a brain aneurysm is often discovered when it rup-
tures and causes a subarachnoid hemorrhage; 
Whereas a subarachnoid hemorrhage can lead to brain dam-
age, hydrocephalus, stroke, and death; 
Whereas, each year, more than 30,000 people in the United 
States suffer from ruptured brain aneurysms, and 40 
percent of these people die as a result;

Whereas, annually, between 3,000 and 4,500 people in the 
United States with ruptured brain aneurysms die before 
reaching the hospital; 
Whereas a number of advancements have been made in re-
cent years regarding the detection of aneurysms, includ-
ing the computerized tomography (CT) scan, the mag-
netic resonance imaging (MRI) test, and the cerebral 
arteriogram, and early detection can save lives; 
Whereas various research studies are currently being con-
ducted in the United States in order to better under-
stand, prevent, and treat brain aneurysms; 
Whereas organizations, such as the Brain Aneurysm Founda-
tion, serve as global leaders for brain aneurysm aware-
ness, education, support, advocacy, and research funding; 
and 
Whereas the month of September would be an appropriate 
month to designate as ‘‘National Brain Aneurysm Aware-
ness Month’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the designation of a ‘‘National 
2
