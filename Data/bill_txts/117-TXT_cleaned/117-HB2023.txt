(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:

•HR 2023 IH
(1) More than 30,000,000 adults in the United 
1
States are not able to read or write above a third- 
2
grade level. 
3
(2) Of adults in the United States who live in 
4
poverty, nearly half have low levels of literacy. 
5
(3) Children whose parents have low levels of 
6
literacy are more than 70 percent more likely to also 
7
have low levels of literacy and are more likely to get 
8
poor grades, display behavioral problems, have high 
9
absentee rates, repeat school years, or drop out. 
10
(4) The 2019 National Assessment of Edu-
11
cational Progress 4th Grade Reading Level Assess-
12
ment showed the national average reading score for 
13
2019 was lower than 2017. 
14
(5) More than 70 percent of State prison in-
15
mates have low levels of literacy. 
16
(6) Low levels of literacy are connected to over 
17
$230,000,000,000 a year in health care costs in the 
18
United States. 
19
(7) Dyslexia is thought to be the most common 
20
neurocognitive disorder, affecting about 10 percent 
21
of children in school. 
22
(8) In 1997, Congress asked the Director of the 
23
National Institute of Child Health and Human De-
24

consultation with the Secretary of Education, to con-
1
vene a national panel, the National Reading Panel, 
2
to assess the status of research-based knowledge, in-
3
cluding the effectiveness of various approaches to 
4
teaching children to read. The report, released in 
5
2000, documented overwhelming evidence that in-
6
struction in phonics enhances all students’ success in 
7
learning to read. 
8
(9) In 2014, in response to the Pennsylvania 
9
General Assembly’s passage of Act 69 of 2014, the 
10
Pennsylvania Department of Education developed 
11
the Dyslexia Screening and Early Literacy Interven-
12
tion Pilot Program, which established a three-year 
13
early literacy intervention and dyslexia pilot program 
14
using evidence-based screening and then evidence- 
15
based instruction and intervention for students 
16
found to be at risk for future reading difficulties. 
17
Such Program identified students in kindergarten 
18
who were deemed at risk for reading difficulties, in-
19
cluding dyslexia, using screening tests.

Alabama, 
Arkansas,
