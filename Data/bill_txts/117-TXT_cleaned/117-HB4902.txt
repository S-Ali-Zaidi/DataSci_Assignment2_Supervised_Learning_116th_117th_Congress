SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) One in 3 families with infants and toddlers 
3
struggles to provide the diapers their children need. 
4
(2) Low-income families with infants spend 14 
5
percent of their income on diapers alone, which is 
6
roughly $936 per child, per year. 
7
(3) Low-income families spend twice as much 
8
on diapers for their children, compared to families 
9
who have the means to buy diapers in bulk at a 
10
lower price. 
11
(4) More than 5 million children under the typ-
12
ical potty training age of 3-years-old live in low-in-
13
come families. 
14
(5) Diaper need affects not only the health and 
15
well-being of the child but it can affect the economic 
16
security of the entire family. 
17
(6) Over half of families in diaper need who 
18
rely on child care in order to go to work or school, 
19
missed work or school in the preceding month be-
20
cause they did not have the diapers they needed to 
21
put their child in child care. 
22
(7) No State or Federal child safety-net pro-
23
gram allocates dollars specifically for the purchase of 
24
diapers.
