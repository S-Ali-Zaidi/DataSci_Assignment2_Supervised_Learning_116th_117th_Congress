SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The United States is a world leader in ad-
3
dressing climate change risks through private sector- 
4
led innovation and technological advancement. 
5
(2) The United States Energy Information Ad-
6
ministration estimates that United States energy-re-
7
lated carbon dioxide emissions, since peaking in 
8
2007, have declined by an average of 1.3 percent per 
9
year, starting well before the United States became 
10
a party to the Paris Agreement. This decline 
11
brought greenhouse gas emissions to their lowest lev-
12
els since 1992. 
13
(3) Nuclear energy accounts for nine of the ten 
14
highest-generating power plants in the United 
15
States, and produces one-third the carbon dioxide 
16
emissions of current solar technologies. 
17
(4) According to the International Energy 
18
Agency (IEA), in terms of carbon dioxide emissions, 
19
the United States has conducted ‘‘the largest abso-
20
lute decline among all countries since 2000’’. 
21
(5) President Obama unilaterally joined the 
22
Paris Agreement without involving Congress, with-
23
out consulting outside stakeholders such as energy 
24
companies, and without conducting a cost-benefit 
25
analysis, including an analysis of how a United 
26

•HR 407 IH
States nationally determined contribution (NDC) 
1
would impact competitiveness with countries like the 
2
People’s Republic of China (PRC) that threaten 
3
United States national and economic security. 
4
(6) A report prepared by NERA Economic Con-
5
sulting in 2017 found that meeting the commitments 
6
President Obama made as part of the Paris Agree-
7
ment could reduce the United States gross domestic 
8
product 
by 
$250,000,000,000 
and 
eliminate 
9
2,700,000 jobs by 2025. 
10
(7) Despite being the world’s second largest 
11
economy, the PRC was permitted to be classified as 
12
a ‘‘developing country’’ for purposes of the Paris 
13
Agreement and abused this classification when mak-
14
ing its NDC under the Paris Agreement. 
15
(8) The PRC is the world’s largest emitter of 
16
greenhouse gases, and according to the NDC sub-
17
mitted by the Chinese Communist Party, it will con-
18
tinue raising emissions until 2030. 
19
(9) On September 22, 2020, CCP General Sec-
20
retary Xi Jinping announced his intention for China 
21
to become carbon neutral by 2060, a full decade 
22
later than the 2050 target date committed to by 
23
other major economies.

(10) According to the IEA, coal-fired power 
1
plants were the single largest emitter of carbon diox-
2
ide 
in 
2018. 
China 
has 
dedicated 
over 
3
$50,000,000,000 through the Belt and Road Initia-
4
tive to developing coal projects across 150 countries 
5
in the past seven years, signaling a lack of genuine 
6
intent to combat climate change. 
7
(11) During Paris negotiations, then-Secretary 
8
of State John Kerry acknowledged that even if all 
9
the developed world, which in this context does not 
10
include China, cut carbon dioxide emissions to zero, 
11
it would not offset the emissions coming from the 
12
rest of the globe.
