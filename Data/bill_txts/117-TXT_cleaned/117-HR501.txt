Supporting the members of the 87th Texas Legislature who

Whereas members of the 87th Texas Legislature expressed

against it; 
Whereas members of the Texas House of Representatives for 
the 87th Legislature are recognized as a coalition of the 
courageous for their valiant efforts to uphold voting

Whereas this coalition of the courageous joins the ranks of 
a group of Texas Representatives and Senators who em-
ployed the procedural walkout tactic in 2003 to delay 
voted on mid-Census redistricting; 
Whereas Senate Bill 7 is just one of many recent iterations 
of State-sanctioned voter suppression reported across the 
United States, with an overall total of 389 voter restric-
tion bills introduced in 48 States during 2021 legislative 
sessions according to the Brennan Center; 
Whereas due to the increase in voter restriction and suppres-
sion legislation coupled with the upcoming 56th anniver-
sary of the enactment of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 
it is imperative that Congress pass H.R. 1, the For the 
People Act, and H.R. 4, the John Lewis Voting Rights 
Advancement Act, to preserve the right to free, fair, and 
safe elections for all Americans; and 
Whereas the following Texas Democrats fought against the 
State’s Senate Bill 7 with every tool they had: Represent-
atives Joe Deshotel (HD–22), Ron Reynolds (HD–27), 
Ryan Guillen (HD–31), Abel Herrero (HD–34), Oscar
