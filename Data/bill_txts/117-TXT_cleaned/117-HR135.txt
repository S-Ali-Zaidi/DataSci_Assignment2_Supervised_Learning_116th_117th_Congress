RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the designation of May 2021 as 
‘‘Spondyloarthritis Awareness Month’’. 
Whereas spondyloarthritis is the name given to a family of 
closely related, chronic rheumatic diseases that pose a 
major health concern in the United States, impacting 1 
in 100 Americans; 
Whereas spondyloarthritis affects 3.2 million adults in the 
United States, more than rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and multiple scle-
rosis (MS) combined; 
Whereas spondyloarthritis can occur early in a person’s life 
and is a condition for which there is no known cure; 
Whereas early diagnosis is critical in effectively treating the 
disease, preventing certain complications, and improving

quality of life and function for those impacted with 
spondyloarthritis; 
Whereas many women, especially Black women, impacted by 
the disease remain undiagnosed due to inadequate aware-
ness, with the average diagnostic delay being seven to ten 
years; 
Whereas there are fewer than 400 pediatric rheumatologists 
in the United States and almost one-fourth of the 
300,000 children with arthritis must travel 80 or more 
miles to see a rheumatologist; 
Whereas spondyloarthritis includes ankylosing spondylitis, 
psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis, enteropathic arthri-
tis, 
juvenile 
spondyloarthritis, 
undifferentiated 
spondyloarthritis, 
peripheral 
spondyloarthritis, 
axial 
spondyloarthritis, 
and 
nonradiographic 
axial 
spondyloarthritis; 
Whereas symptoms of spondyloarthritis typically begin before 
the age of 45, with early signs including frequent pain 
and stiffness in the lower back and buttocks, pain in a 
peripheral joint such as the hip, ankle, elbow, heel, or 
shoulder; 
Whereas a portion of people with spondyloarthritis will 
progress to spinal fusion and become prone to fractures, 
thoracic kyphosis, or eroded peripheral joints especially 
the hips and shoulders; 
Whereas complications from spondyloarthritis may cause seri-
ous inflammation in other organs including the heart, 
lungs, skin, gastrointestinal tract, nerves, and eyes; 
Whereas public awareness and education campaigns on 
spondyloarthritis and its symptoms, targeting both med-
ical professionals and the general public, can increase the

likelihood of earlier diagnosis to improve health outcomes 
for patients and support an informed society; and 
Whereas people living with this potentially debilitating disease 
should be provided with the resources, education, and 
support needed for a timely diagnosis, and improved 
treatment outcomes, so that they can live their lives to 
the fullest: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) 
supports 
the 
designation 
of

‘‘Spondyloarthritis Awareness Month’’; 
3
(2) recognizes that adequate awareness leads to 
4
earlier diagnosis, which can reduce the severity of 
5
the disease, especially in the African-American com-
6
munity; and 
7
(3) supports national efforts to educate medical 
8
professionals 
and 
communities 
about 
9
spondyloarthritis and the need for more research 
10
funding, early detection initiatives, and effective 
11
treatments.
