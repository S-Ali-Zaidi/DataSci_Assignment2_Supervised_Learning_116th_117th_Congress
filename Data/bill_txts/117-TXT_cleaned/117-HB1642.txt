A BILL 
To direct the Attorney General to prioritize the investigation 
and prosecution of Federal firearms offenses, and for 
other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Prosecuting Gun 
4
Crimes Saves Lives Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
The Congress finds as follows: 
7
(1) Promoting public safety, addressing gun- 
8
based homicides, and enforcing Federal firearms 
9

•HR 1642 IH
laws are among the highest priorities of the Con-
1
gress. 
2
(2) Point-of-sale background checks can reduce 
3
the risk of gun-based homicides by preventing crimi-
4
nals and prohibited persons from purchasing fire-
5
arms while protecting access for law-abiding citizens. 
6
(3) Under the Gun Control Act of 1968, cat-
7
egories of persons who may pose a threat to public 
8
safety, including violent felons, fugitives from jus-
9
tice, and persons convicted of domestic violence 
10
crimes, are prohibited from shipping, transporting, 
11
receiving, or possessing firearms or ammunition. 
12
(4) Thousands of prohibited persons illegally at-
13
tempt to purchase firearms every year. In 2017, the 
14
FBI’s NICS Section referred 112,090 denied trans-
15
actions to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms 
16
and Explosives (ATF). Of these NICS denials, only 
17
12, or 0.09 percent, were prosecuted in 2017. 
18
(5) On March 12, 2018, former Attorney Gen-
19
eral Jeff Sessions issued a memo directing Depart-
20
ment of Justice prosecutors to prioritize ‘‘vigorous 
21
and appropriate’’ prosecution of cases involving false 
22
statements on Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Ex-
23
plosives Form 4473. The memo stated that ‘‘Crimi-
24
nals and other prohibited persons who attempt to 
25
00:35 May 01, 2021

•HR 1642 IH
thwart the background check process by lying on the 
1
required forms threaten to undermine this important 
2
crime prevention tool’’ and that ‘‘we must vigilantly 
3
protect the integrity of the background system 
4
through appropriate prosecution of those who at-
5
tempt to circumvent the law’’. The Department of 
6
Justice’s efforts to reclaim the integrity of the back-
7
ground check system yielded a 23-percent increase 
8
in the number of defendants charged with unlawful 
9
possession of a firearm in the 3 months following 
10
issuance of the memo. 
11
(6) On November 13, 2019, Attorney General 
12
William Barr announced the launch of a new initia-
13
tive, Project Guardian, to reduce gun-based homi-
14
cides by investigating, prosecuting, and preventing 
15
firearm crimes. Project Guardian will address gun- 
16
based homicides by encouraging coordinated pros-
17
ecution efforts, enforcement of the background check 
18
system, improved information-sharing, response to 
19
mental health denials, and crime gun intelligence co-
20
ordination. 
21
(7) Congress must ensure Federal, State, and 
22
local entities tasked with preventing prohibited indi-
23
viduals from purchasing firearms, recovering fire-
24
arms from prohibited individuals, and investigating 
25

and prosecuting lying and buying and lying and try-
1
ing cases have sufficient information and resources 
2
to carry out their missions and promote public safe-
3
ty. 
4
(8) Congress urges the Attorney General to 
5
prioritize the investigation and prosecution of Fed-
6
eral firearm offenses to protect Americans and pre-
7
vent and deter the illegal purchase and possession of 
8
firearms.

SEC. 3. INFORMATION-SHARING WITH STATE FUSION CEN-
10
TERS. 
11
Not later than 60 days after the date of the enact-
12
ment of this Act, the Attorney General may direct the Bu-
13
reau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to reg-
14
ularly provide to State and local law enforcement agencies, 
15
including through State law enforcement fusion centers 
16
(as defined in section 210A(j)(1) of the Homeland Secu-
17
rity Act of 2002) a report listing individuals for whom 
18
the National Instant Criminal Background Check System 
19
has issued firearm transfer denials, including the basis for 
20
the denial, with the purpose of equipping law enforcement 
21
with the information they need to prevent persons from 
22
illegally purchasing, receiving, or possessing firearms.
