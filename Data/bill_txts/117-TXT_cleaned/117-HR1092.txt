RESOLUTION 
Supporting the goals and ideals of National Hurricane 
Preparedness Week. 
Whereas the Atlantic and central Pacific hurricane season be-
gins June 1, 2022, and ends November 30, 2022, and 
the eastern Pacific hurricane season runs from May 15, 
2022, through November 30, 2022; 
Whereas an average of 14 tropical storms develop per year 
over the Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea, and the Gulf 
of Mexico, and an average of 7 of these storms become 
hurricanes; 
Whereas in an average 3-year period, roughly 5 hurricanes 
strike the coastlines of the United States, which can re-
sult in multiple deaths, and 40 percent of which are typi-

cally labeled ‘‘major’’ or ‘‘intense’’ category 3 hurricanes 
as measured on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale; 
Whereas millions of Americans face great risks from tropical 
storms and hurricanes, as 50 percent of Americans live 
along the coast and millions of tourists visit the oceans 
each year; 
Whereas the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season was the 3rd 
most active on record, included 21 named storms, con-
sisting of 7 hurricanes, 4 of which were category 3 or 
higher, and 8 storms made landfall in the United States; 
Whereas during a hurricane, homes, businesses, public build-
ings, and infrastructure may be damaged or destroyed by 
heavy rain, strong winds, and storm surge; 
Whereas damage from a hurricane is usually substantial, as 
debris can break windows and doors, roads and bridges 
can be washed away, homes can be flooded, and destruc-
tive tornadoes can occur well away from the storm’s cen-
ter; 
Whereas experts at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration’s National Hurricane Center and the Na-
tional Weather Service agree that it is critical for all peo-
ple to know if they live in an area prone to hurricanes, 
to figure out their home’s vulnerability in the event of a 
storm surge, flooding, and heavy winds, and to develop 
a written family disaster plan based on this knowledge; 
Whereas between 1963–2012, inland flooding was responsible 
for a quarter of deaths associated with tropical storms 
and hurricanes in the United States; 
Whereas the National Weather Service recommends that 
when a hurricane threatens the United States, people in 
potential flood zones evacuate if told to do so, keep

abreast of road conditions through the news media, move 
to a safe area before access is cut off by flood water, de-
velop a flood emergency action plan, and do not attempt 
to cross flowing water in an automobile, because as little 
as 6 inches of water may cause one to lose control of the 
vehicle; 
Whereas the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administra-
tion provides more detailed information about hurricanes 
and hurricane preparedness via its website, https:// 
www.weather.gov/wrn/hurricane-preparedness; and 
Whereas National Hurricane Preparedness Week will be the 
week of May 1 through May 7, 2022: Now, therefore, be 
it
