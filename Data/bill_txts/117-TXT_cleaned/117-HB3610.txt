Congress makes the following findings:

•HR 3610 IH
(1) Over the last 50 years, the demographics of 
1
the Nation’s workforce have undergone significant 
2
changes. As a result of the changes, the modern 
3
workforce has a more diverse set of needs. 
4
(2) Over time, increasing numbers of women 
5
have joined the workforce. The Bureau of Labor 
6
Statistics reports that in 1960 women composed 33 
7
percent of employed persons, whereas in 2010 they 
8
were 47 percent of employed persons. 
9
(3) Fewer households have at least 1 parent at 
10
home. According to the Bureau of the Census, more 
11
than 70 percent of children are raised in families 
12
that are headed by either a working single parent or 
13
2 working parents. Furthermore, the number of 
14
households with married parents and children, in 
15
which both parents were in the workforce, rose to 66 
16
percent in 2010. The number of single-parent fami-
17
lies has also increased, almost tripling over the last 
18
50 years, from 5 percent in 1960, to 14 percent in 
19
2010. 
20
(4) More households are caring for older rel-
21
atives. According to the Bureau of the Census, the 
22
average life expectancy for a child born in 2010 is 
23
78.3 years, almost 10 years longer than for a child 
24
born in 1960. The National Alliance for Caregiving 
25
05:37 Jun 24, 2021

•HR 3610 IH
found that 57 percent of persons who provide unpaid 
1
care to an adult or to a child with special needs are 
2
employed, with 46 percent working full time and 11 
3
percent working part time. 
4
(5) Many jobs are now located outside of city 
5
centers. Low-wage employees in particular have dif-
6
ficulty reaching jobs through public transportation 
7
during off-peak shifts, such as shifts that start in 
8
the evening or early morning. 
9
(6) In response to the needs of the modern 
10
workforce some employers have instituted flexible 
11
work arrangements, which, according to Georgetown 
12
University Law School’s Workforce Flexibility 2010 
13
initiative, are voluntary arrangements between em-
14
ployees and employers that alter the time or place 
15
at which work is conducted, or the amount of work 
16
that is conducted, in order to allow employees to 
17
more easily meet the needs of both work and family 
18
life. 
19
(7) The National Study of the Changing Work-
20
force, published in 2002 by the Families and Work 
21
Institute, found that employees with access to flexi-
22
ble work arrangements reported less interference be-
23
tween their job and family life, and fewer mental 
24
health problems.

(8) Corporate Voices for Working Families 
1
found that implementing workplace flexibility im-
2
proves employee satisfaction, morale, and teamwork 
3
as well as employee health, well-being, and resilience, 
4
and helps to reduce stress. 
5
(9) Flexible work arrangements have also been 
6
shown to improve the bottom line for businesses. 
7
Corporate Voices for Working Families found that 
8
implementing workplace flexibility improves the bot-
9
tom line by helping businesses to attract and retain 
10
key talent, increase employee retention and reduce 
11
turnover, reduce overtime and absenteeism, and en-
12
hance employee productivity, effectiveness, and en-
13
gagement. 
14
(10) The President’s Council of Economic Advi-
15
sors found that, as more businesses adopt flexibility 
16
practices, the benefits to society, in the form of re-
17
duced traffic, improved employment outcomes, and 
18
more efficient allocation of employees to employers, 
19
may be greater than the gains to individual busi-
20
nesses and employees. 
21
(11) According to a 2011 Government Account-
22
ability Office report, a flexible work environment can 
23
increase and enhance employment opportunities for 
24
individuals with disabilities.

(12) The Society for Human Resource Manage-

ment believes that the key to getting the best out of 
2
every employee is a flexible work environment.

(13) According to the National Partnership for 
4
Women and Families, businesses can retain their 
5
most valuable asset—a trained and committed work-
6
force—by offering flexible workplace policies.
