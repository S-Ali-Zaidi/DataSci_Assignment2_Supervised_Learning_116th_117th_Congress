SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
11
It is the sense of Congress that— 
12
(1) in much of the United States renewable 
13
generation projects and energy storage projects face 
14
unfair and inefficient barriers to Commission-juris-
15
dictional interconnection with the electric grid; 
16
(2) legislation is needed to accelerate the timely 
17
and efficient interconnection of renewable generation 
18
projects and energy storage projects, and to ensure 
19
that individual interconnection customers are not 
20
forced to bear disproportionate amounts of shared 
21
network upgrade costs; 
22
(3) network upgrades required to be con-
23
structed 
to 
interconnect 
renewable 
generation 
24
projects and energy storage projects benefit all 
25

•HR 4027 IH
transmission system customers as well as parties 
1
that receive power delivered over such transmission 
2
systems; 
3
(4) the practice of exclusive or disproportionate 
4
participant funding, whereby the costs of network 
5
upgrades are assigned solely or disproportionately to 
6
individual interconnection customers, is unduly dis-
7
criminatory, harmful to consumers, and not in the 
8
public interest; 
9
(5) in certain cases, the deployment of grid en-
10
hancing technologies can substitute for, and thereby 
11
reduce the need for, time required, or cost to con-
12
struct, a traditional transmission upgrade or addi-
13
tion, such as modifying or adding a conductor or 
14
substation element, that otherwise would be required 
15
to interconnect a new generation project or energy 
16
storage project; 
17
(6) by reducing the need for, and the time nec-
18
essary to construct, a traditional transmission up-
19
grade or addition, such as modifying or adding a 
20
conductor or substation element, the deployment of 
21
grid enhancing technologies would facilitate timely, 
22
efficient, and cost-effective interconnections, and the 
23
renewable generation projects and energy storage 
24
projects dependent on those interconnections, and

•HR 4027 IH
the delivery of clean and reliable electricity produced 
1
by those projects; and 
2
(7) collectively, the development and construc-
3
tion of renewable generation projects, energy storage 
4
projects, and grid enhancing technologies should cre-
5
ate tens of thousands of family-sustaining jobs, fa-
6
cilitate rural economic development, enhance Federal 
7
and State tax revenues, and further the timely and 
8
cost-effective delivery of clean, affordable, and reli-
9
able electricity. 
10
SEC. 3. EQUITABLE COST ALLOCATION. 
11
(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 180 days after the 
12
date of enactment of this Act, the Commission shall issue 
13
a new regulation, or revise existing regulations, to prohibit 
14
the use of exclusive or disproportionate participant fund-
15
ing. 
16
(b) ALLOCATION OF COSTS.— 
17
(1) IN GENERAL.—In prohibiting the use of ex-
18
clusive or disproportionate participant funding under 
19
subsection (a), the Commission shall, except as pro-
20
vided in paragraph (4), require that each public util-
21
ity— 
22
(A) may not allocate the costs of a network 
23
upgrade solely to the requesting interconnection 
24
customer; and 
25

•HR 4027 IH
(B) shall reasonably allocate such costs to 
1
parties that— 
2
(i) use the transmission facility or the 
3
transmission system; 
4
(ii) take electricity from the trans-
5
mission facility or the transmission system; 
6
or 
7
(iii) otherwise benefit from a network 
8
upgrade of the transmission facility or the 
9
transmission system. 
10
(2) INTERCONNECTION
TO
MULTIPLE
TRANS-
11
MISSION SYSTEMS.—With respect to a network up-
12
grade that is associated with a generation project or 
13
an energy storage project that has a significant im-
14
pact on two or more transmission systems, the costs 
15
for such a network upgrade shall be allocated pursu-
16
ant to a methodology designed jointly by the im-
17
pacted transmission systems to ensure that all such 
18
costs are equitably shared by the parties that benefit 
19
from such network upgrade. 
20
(3) DETERMINATION
OF
BENEFITTING
PAR-
21
TIES.—In determining which parties benefit for pur-
22
poses of paragraph (1)(B)(iii) and paragraph (2),

(A) those that cannot be directly quan-
1
tified, including resilience benefits; and

3
duced and avoided emissions of greenhouse 
4
gases and conventional air pollutants.

(4) GENERATOR TIE LINES.—A public utility 
6
may require an interconnection customer to pay for 
7
the costs of construction of any generator tie lines 
8
that will be used to transmit power from the inter-
9
connection customer’s generation project or energy 
10
storage project, as applicable, to the transmission fa-
11
cility or the transmission system. 
12
(5) VOLUNTARY PAYMENT.— 
13
(A) IN GENERAL.—An interconnection cus-
14
tomer may pay upfront some or all of the costs 
15
of a network upgrade at the transmission facil-
16

17
to interconnect their generation project or en-
18
ergy storage project in accordance with sub-
19
paragraph (B). 
20
(B) 
REPAYMENT.—Any 
interconnection 
21
customer that pays costs under subparagraph
