1

•HR 6966 IH
(1) The Internal Revenue Service administers 
1
and enforces the Federal tax laws of the United 
2
States and should seek to continually improve cus-
3
tomer service based on taxpayer needs and feedback. 
4
(2) The people of the United States deserve a 
5
communication system with the Internal Revenue 
6
Service that is reliable, efficient, accessible, and easy 
7
to navigate across multiple channels. 
8
(3) Many agencies, offices, programs, and Fed-
9
eral employees provide excellent customer experi-
10
ences to taxpayers. However, many aspects of the 
11
Federal Government still fall short on delivering the 
12
customer experience that individuals have come to 
13
expect from the private sector. 
14
(4) According to the 2020 American Customer 
15
Satisfaction Index Benchmark, which ranges from 0 
16
to 100, the Internal Revenue Service scored at or 
17
below average compared to customer satisfaction 
18
with other Federal agencies. The average score from 
19
individual e-filers was a 76, small business and self- 
20
employed filers gave an average score of 67, and 
21
large business and international filers and individual 
22
paper filers gave an average score of 59. 
23
(5) The amount of funding spent on taxpayer 
24
assistance and education decreased by $5,000,000

between fiscal year 2010 and fiscal year 2020. The 
1
number of employees providing these services 
2
dropped by 29 percent, and the number of customer 
3
service representatives decreased by 41 percent. 
4
(6) The Internal Revenue Service spent nearly 
5
15 percent less during fiscal year 2020 when com-
6
pared to fiscal year 2010 in examinations and collec-
7
tions. During this time period, the number of Inter-
8
nal Revenue Service employees working in this area 
9
declined by 32 percent and the number of Internal 
10
Revenue Service employees working as revenue 
11
agents declined by 40 percent. 
12
(7) Completing the hiring process for prospec-
13
tive Internal Revenue Service employees can take the 
14
agency approximately six to eight months. 
15
(8) Taxpayers will experience an easier, clearer, 
16
and quicker tax filing system if the Internal Revenue 
17
Service provides more reliable and efficient customer 
18
service and taxpayer support services. 
19
(9) To improve services to taxpayers, the Inter-
20
nal Revenue Service should work across its depart-
21
ments, leverage updated technology to track tax re-
22
turns, and enhance the customer service experience.

It is the sense of Congress that—

•HR 6966 IH
(1) the Internal Revenue Service should im-
1
prove its taxpayer support services and customer 
2
service experiences for the people of the United 
3
States. To do this, the Internal Revenue Service 
4
must develop an efficient system that enables tax-
5
payers to track the process of their tax submissions 
6
and receive timely support when submitting an in-
7
quiry to the Internal Revenue Service, 
8
(2) adequate funding is needed to ensure that 
9
Internal Revenue Service workforce, staffing levels, 
10
and technological resources can provide the public 
11
with improved customer service and problem resolu-
12
tion. A significant portion of Internal Revenue Serv-
13
ice funding should be spent on increasing the num-
14
ber of employees in taxpayer-facing positions, includ-
15
ing employees working to address taxpayer questions 
16
and as customer service staff, 
17
(3) Congress should appropriate the funding 
18
necessary to enable the IRS to achieve these im-
19
proved standards for taxpayer services and support, 
20
(4) the Internal Revenue Service should accel-
21
erate its hiring timeline for onboarding new employ-
22
ees, to enable an easy career transition for incoming 
23
employees and ensure the Internal Revenue Service

is not losing prospective employees because of a slow

hiring process, and 
2
(5) the Internal Revenue Service should expe-
3
dite its ongoing efforts to develop and expand elec-
4
tronic portals, through which taxpayers can check 
5
the status of their tax returns and submit inquiries 
6
to the Internal Revenue Service.
