RESOLUTION 
Expressing the need for protecting and conserving at least 
50 percent of the lands and oceans in the United States 
and encouraging diplomatic efforts to achieve this goal 
worldwide. 
Whereas the Earth is facing a biodiversity and extinction cri-
sis; 
Whereas there has been an average 68-percent decrease in 
population sizes of mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, 
and fish between 1970 and 2016; 
Whereas the global rate of species extinction is at least tens 
to hundreds of times higher than the average rate over 
the past 10,000,000 years and is accelerating;

Whereas humans are causing an unprecedented decline in 
natural ecosystems and global biodiversity, and at current 
rates could cause the extinction of more than 1,000,000 
species; 
Whereas climate change and the destruction of natural envi-
ronments present existential crises for humans and mil-
lions of other species around the world; 
Whereas all life depends on essential ecosystems, including 
for food, clean air and water, protection from extreme 
weather events, and as a source for new medicines; 
Whereas damaging or erasing ecosystems can therefore have 
a profound impact on wildlife and human health and 
well-being; 
Whereas inequitable policies have led to a targeted denuding 
of biodiversity in communities of color and low-income 
communities, creating great harm and preventing these 
communities from having equal access to the benefits of 
biodiversity; 
Whereas land degradation is one of the largest contributors 
to climate change and is responsible for the loss of tril-
lions of dollars’ worth of ecosystem benefits each year; 
Whereas scientific studies indicate that if current trends in 
habitat conversion and anthropogenic emissions do not 
peak by 2030, global temperatures will rise more than 
1.5° Celsius, resulting in severe impacts to ecosystems 
globally; 
Whereas the late E.O. Wilson has estimated that protecting 
half of the Earth’s land and seas would be sufficient to 
preserve 85 percent of the planet’s species, and with it, 
global biodiversity;

Whereas conserving and restoring natural ecosystems pro-
vides greater net economic benefits than destroying nat-
ural spaces and wildlife for profit; 
Whereas jobs that do not harm biodiversity, such as the out-
door recreation industry that alone accounted for 1.8 per-
cent ($374,000,000,000) of current-dollar gross domestic 
product and created 4,300,000 direct jobs in 2020, en-
able individuals to have meaningful careers outside of 
toxic industries that harm their health; 
Whereas public-private partnerships play a notable role in 
achieving conservation efforts within the United States 
and around the world; 
Whereas studies have shown that communities often experi-
ence economic and employment growth and health im-
provements when local natural areas are protected; 
Whereas establishing protected natural areas can reduce local 
rates of infectious diseases, provide cleaner drinking 
water, improve diets, reduce air pollution, and generally 
provide for a healthier population; 
Whereas access to nature ensures cultural and spiritual en-
richment, as well as physical and mental health benefits; 
Whereas biodiversity conservation is essential to ensure that 
pollinators and other beneficial species for food produc-
tion, 
globally 
valued 
at 
up 
to 
more 
than 
$500,000,000,000, will continue to thrive; 
Whereas natural areas such as forests, wetlands, grasslands, 
and mangroves can sequester large amounts of carbon, 
and protecting these areas prevents sequestered carbon 
from being released into the atmosphere; 
Whereas the disappearance and destruction of natural habitat 
is the primary cause of biological diversity loss at every

level and is a cause of zoonotic spillover that can con-
tribute to pandemics; 
Whereas only by the preservation of substantial, more nat-
ural, intact habitat than previously envisioned can 
human-driven extinctions be eliminated; and 
Whereas the America the Beautiful Initiative and its goal of 
conserving 30 percent of lands and oceans in the United 
States by 2030 is a crucial first step to protecting bio-
diversity and mitigating the effects of climate change: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-

resentatives that—

(1) the Earth is facing an imminent crisis from

the extinction of species and the decline of biodiver-
4
sity; and 
5
(2) Congress should work to support protecting

and conserving at least 50 percent of the lands and 
7
oceans in the United States and encourage diplo-

matic efforts to achieve this goal worldwide.
