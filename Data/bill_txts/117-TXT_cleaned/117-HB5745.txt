1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

Congress finds the following:

•HR 5745 IH
(1) A public health emergency regarding the 
1
COVID–19 pandemic was first declared on January 
2
31, 2020, and has been subsequently renewed re-
3
peatedly, most recently on July 19, 2021, by the 
4
Secretary of Health and Human Services under both 
5
Republican and Democratic administrations. 
6
(2) In the spring of 2020, the only tests avail-
7
able to determine whether a person had a recent or 
8
prior infection of SARS–CoV–2 were serology tests 
9
which could identify whether a person had antibodies 
10
specific to the SARS–CoV–2 virus. 
11
(3) On May 8, 2020, the Centers for Medicare 
12
& Medicaid Services (CMS), citing the ongoing 
13
COVID–19 public health emergency, issued an in-
14
terim final rule which recognized on an interim basis 
15
that certain Food and Drug Administration-author-
16
ized serology tests fall under the Medicare benefit 
17
category for diagnostic laboratory tests. 
18
(4) On March 5, 2021, the Food and Drug Ad-
19
ministration issued the first authorization for the 
20
emergency use of a cellular (T-cell) immune re-
21
sponse COVID–19 test intended for use as an aid in 
22
identifying individuals with an adaptive T-cell im-
23
mune response to SARS–CoV–2, indicating recent or 
24
prior infection with SARS–CoV–2.

(5) CMS has yet to update its May 8, 2020, in-
1
terim final rule or provide separate guidance to clar-
2
ify that Medicare coverage extends to other Food 
3
and Drug Administration-authorized tests, including 
4
T-cell tests, that are intended for diagnosing recent 
5
or prior infection with SARS–CoV–2. 
6
(6) In research and development related to in-
7
fectious diseases and vaccines, including SARS– 
8
CoV–2, historically the antibody response, which is 
9
only half of the adaptive immune system, has been 
10
the primary tool for assessment. 
11
(7) The other half of the adaptive immune re-
12
sponse, the T-cell response, has historically been 
13
more difficult to assess, but scientific and techno-
14
logical advances now allow for standardized and sen-
15
sitive methods to measure T-cells. 
16
(8) The National Institutes of Health have inte-
17
grated T-cell testing into certain studies regarding 
18
the impact of T-cells in detecting and defending 
19
against SARS–CoV–2 variants, and there exist addi-
20
tional research opportunities regarding the cellular 
21
immune response to SARS–CoV–2, including— 
22
(A) identifying the type and duration of T- 
23
cell response that confers immunity (including 
24

to variants) following natural infection, vaccina-
1
tion, or both; 
2
(B) understanding the T-cell response in 
3
different populations, including children, the el-
4
derly, and immunocompromised individuals; and 
5
(C) understanding the T-cell response in 
6
patients facing long-term COVID–19 symp-
7
toms. 
8
(9) Evidence shows T-cells play an important 
9
role in the immune response to COVID–19 and 
10
points to the need for a concerted research effort, 
11
which could have profound consequences on public 
12
health, such as policies on boosters or the develop-
13
ment of therapeutics for patients suffering from 
14
post-acute sequelae of COVID–19 infection.

SEC. 3. CLARIFYING MEDICARE COVERAGE OF COVID–19 DI-
16
AGNOSTIC LABORATORY TESTS. 
17
(a) IN GENERAL.—The Administrator of the Centers 
18
for Medicare & Medicaid Services shall by interim rule, 
19
subregulatory guidance, or otherwise, provide for coverage 
20
of T-cell diagnostic laboratory tests furnished during the 
21
period beginning on January 1, 2022, and ending on the 
22
last date of the public health emergency period (described 
23
in section 1135(g)(1)(B) of the Social Security Act (42 
24
U.S.C. 1320b–5(g)(1)(B))) for beneficiaries with current

1
or suspected past COVID–19 infection. 
2
(b) T-CELL DIAGNOSTIC LABORATORY TEST DE-
3
FINED.—For purposes of subsection (a), the term ‘‘T-cell 
4
diagnostic laboratory test’’ means a clinical laboratory test 
5
that is— 
6
(1) intended to identify an adaptive T-cell im-
7
mune response to SARS–CoV–2 indicative of recent 
8
or prior infection with SARS–CoV–2; and 
9
(2) cleared, approved, or otherwise authorized 
10
