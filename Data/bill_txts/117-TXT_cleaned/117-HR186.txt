Whereas Trevor Reed was accused of grabbing the arm of the 
police officer driving the vehicle and elbowing another of-
ficer while en route to the police station, causing the ve-
hicle to swerve and therefore endangering the lives of the 
police officers; 
Whereas the United States Embassy in Moscow has filed nu-
merous diplomatic notes with the Russian Foreign Min-
istry regarding Trevor Reed being denied consular access, 
communications, medical treatment, family visitations, 
and other violations of the Vienna Convention on Con-
sular Relations; 
Whereas Trevor Reed was not given food or water until ap-
proximately 72 hours after his initial arrest; 
Whereas Trevor Reed was not given a medical evaluation of 
his injuries until 10 days following his arrest;

to the courts that disproves the police officers’ statements 
of supposed endangerment and wrongdoing; 
Whereas Trevor Reed’s defense team was denied access to 
additional video evidence from inside the police vehicle 
and police station that had the potential to prove his in-
nocence, the requests for all video recordings are docu-
mented, and the existence of the other videos was con-
firmed by police officials and investigators; 
Whereas the police officers claimed emotional and physical 
damages, but did not sustain any visible injury, or claim

lice officers victims;

Jurisdiction concurred that Russian procedural law was 
violated in the way that Trevor Reed’s bail was revoked; 
Whereas the United States Embassy in Moscow has filed 
complaints with the Russian Foreign Ministry regarding 
denial of communications with Trevor Reed; 
Whereas during the trial, the defense counsel presented 59 
minutes of traffic camera video from four traffic cam-
eras, and senior Russian Government officials analyzed 
the video recordings and confirmed that the videos 
showed the police car— 
(1) did not change direction or leave its lane; 
(2) did not swerve; and 
(3) did not stop or slow down; 
Whereas witnesses following directly behind the police car in 
a private vehicle never witnessed any dangerous move-
ment of the police car; 
Whereas the two police officers changed their testimonies in 
writing, in their interviews, and at least three times dur-
ing defense questioning, with final answers to the judge 
being ‘‘I don’t remember.’’, causing court attendees and 
the judge to laugh; 
Whereas the Investigative Bureau and Golovinsky District 
Court Judge Arnout denied Trevor Reed’s requests to in-
vestigate how his injuries occurred; 
Whereas, on July 30, 2020, Golovinsky District Court Judge 
Arnout read a verdict that dismissed all defense evidence, 
witnesses, and government experts and only considered 
pieces of the police officers’ statements; 
Whereas the judge sentenced Trevor Reed to 9 years in pris-
on camp and was ordered to pay 100,000 rubles to each 
police officer for moral and physical injuries;

Whereas Trevor Reed had already been detained in Russia 
for one year at the time of the judge’s verdict; 
Whereas a Consul representing the United States Embassy in 
Moscow attended all of Trevor Reed’s trial hearings; 
Whereas the United States Ambassador to Russia, John Sul-
livan, upon Trevor’s sentencing, stated that the prosecu-
tion’s case and the evidence presented against Mr. Reed 
were ‘‘so preposterous that they provoked laughter in the 
courtroom’’, the conviction and sentence were ‘‘ridicu-
lous’’, and ‘‘justice was not even considered’’; 
Whereas, upon appeal to the Moscow City Court, the 
Golovinsky District Court failed to provide Trevor Reed 
with translated copies of the court’s decision and trial 
transcripts per law; and 
Whereas the appeal court returned the case to the Golovinsky 
District Court to review omissions and incorrect state-
ments in the trial transcripts, and the official court audio 
recordings were reviewed by the defense and the correc-
tions were certified by a third-party notarization firm, 
with the result being Judge Arnout refusing to include 
any corrections to the corrupted transcripts: Now, there-
fore, be it
