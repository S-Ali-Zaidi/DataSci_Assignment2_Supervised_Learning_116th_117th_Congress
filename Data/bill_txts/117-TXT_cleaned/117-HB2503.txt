(1) There is a significant body of evidence 
1
showing that economic and social conditions have a

powerful impact on individual and population health 
3
outcomes and well-being, as well as medical costs. 
4
(2) State, local, and Tribal governments and 
5
the service delivery partners of such governments 
6
face significant challenges in coordinating benefits 
7
and services delivered through the Medicaid program 
8
and other social services programs because of the 
9
fragmented and complex nature of Federal and 
10
State funding and administrative requirements. 
11
(3) The Federal Government should prioritize 
12
and proactively assist State and local governments 
13
to strengthen the capacity of State and local govern-
14
ments to improve health and social outcomes for in-
15
dividuals, thereby improving cost-effectiveness and 
16
return on investment.

(b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this Act are as fol-
18
lows:

(2) To build a pipeline of State and locally de-
1
signed, cross-sector interventions and strategies that

generate rigorous evidence about how to improve

fectiveness of, and return on investment from, Fed-
5
eral, State, local, and Tribal health and social serv-
6
ices programs. 
7
(3) To enlist State and local governments and 
8
the service providers of such governments as part-

administrative challenges in improving the health 
11

12
turn on investment from, Federal spending on indi-
13
viduals enrolled in Medicaid. 
14
(4) To develop strategies to improve health and
