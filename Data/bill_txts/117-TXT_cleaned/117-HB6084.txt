(1) IN GENERAL.—The Energy Product Reli-
8
ability Organization may impose a penalty on a user, 
9
owner, or operator of an energy pipeline for a viola-
10
tion of an energy product reliability standard ap-
11
proved by the Commission under subsection (e) if 
12
the Energy Product Reliability Organization, after 
13
notice and an opportunity for a hearing— 
14
(A) finds that the user, owner, or operator 
15
has violated an energy product reliability stand-
16
ard approved by the Commission under sub-
17
section (e); and 
18
(B) files notice and the record of the pro-
19
ceeding with the Commission. 
20
(2) PROCEDURES.—A penalty imposed under 
21
paragraph (1) may take effect not earlier than the 
22
31st day after the Energy Product Reliability Orga-
23

24
alty and the record of proceedings. Such penalty 
25
23:25 Dec 08, 2021
H6084

•HR 6084 IH
shall be subject to review by the Commission, on its 
1
own motion or upon application by the user, owner, 
2
or operator that is the subject of the penalty filed 
3
within 30 days after the date such notice is filed 
4
with the Commission. Application to the Commission 
5
for review, or the initiation of review by the Commis-
6
sion on its own motion, shall not operate as a stay 
7
of such penalty unless the Commission otherwise or-
8
ders upon its own motion or upon application by the 
9
user, owner, or operator that is the subject of such 
10
penalty. In any proceeding to review a penalty im-
11
posed under paragraph (1), the Commission, after 
12
notice and opportunity for hearing (which hearing 
13
may consist solely of the record before the Energy 
14
Product Reliability Organization and opportunity for 
15
the presentation of supporting reasons to affirm, 
16
modify, or set aside the penalty), shall by order af-
17
firm, set aside, reinstate, or modify the penalty, and, 
18
if appropriate, remand to the Energy Product Reli-
19
ability Organization for further proceedings. The 
20
Commission shall implement expedited procedures 
21
for such hearings.

23
motion or upon complaint, the Commission may 
24
order compliance with an energy product reliability

•HR 6084 IH
standard and may impose a penalty against a user, 
1
owner, or operator of an energy pipeline if the Com-
2
mission finds, after notice and opportunity for a 
3
hearing, that the user, owner, or operator of the en-
4
ergy pipeline has engaged or is about to engage in 
5
any acts or practices that constitute or will con-
6
stitute a violation of an energy product reliability 
7
standard. 
8
(4) PROTECTION OF INFORMATION.—Any no-
9
tice of enforcement or record pertaining to a viola-
10
tion of an energy product reliability standard relat-
11

12
shall be deemed to be critical electric infrastructure 
13
information (as defined in section 215A of the Fed-
14
eral Power Act (16 U.S.C. 824o–1)). 
15
(5) EPRO 
COMPLIANCE.—The Commission 
16
may take such action as is necessary or appropriate 
17

19
ability standard or any Commission order affecting 
20
the Energy Product Reliability Organization. 
21
(6) CONSIDERATIONS.—Any penalty imposed 
22
under this section shall bear a reasonable relation to 
23
the seriousness of the violation and shall take into 
24
23:25 Dec 08, 2021

12 
•HR 6084 IH
consideration the efforts of the user, owner, or oper-
1
ator to remedy the violation in a timely manner. 
2
(h) CHANGES IN EPRO RULES.—The Energy Prod-
3
uct Reliability Organization shall, with respect to the rules 
4
of the Energy Product Reliability Organization, file with 
5
the Commission for approval any proposed rule or pro-
6
posed rule change, accompanied by an explanation of its 
7
basis and purpose. The Commission, upon its own motion 
8
or complaint, may propose a change to the rules of the 
9
Energy Product Reliability Organization. A proposed rule 
10
or proposed rule change shall take effect upon a finding 
11
by the Commission, after notice and opportunity for com-
12
ment, that the change is just, reasonable, not unduly dis-
13
criminatory or preferential, is in the public interest, and 
14
satisfies the requirements of subsection (d).

19
standard, taking into consideration any rec-
20
ommendation of the Energy Product Reliability 
21
Organization.
