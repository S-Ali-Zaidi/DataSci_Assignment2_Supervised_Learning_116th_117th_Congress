ment, or for any shorter period therein, if the court finds

interest under this section for any period is just in the

circumstances, the court shall consider only— 
11
(1) whether such person or the opposing party, 
12
or either party’s representative, made motions or as-
13
serted claims or defenses so lacking in merit as to 
14
show that such party or representative acted inten-
15
tionally for delay, or otherwise acted in bad faith; 
16
(2) whether, in the course of the action in-
17
volved, such person or the opposing party, or either 
18
party’s representative, violated any applicable rule, 
19
statute, or court order providing for sanctions for 
20
dilatory behavior or otherwise providing for expedi-
21
tious proceedings; and 
22
(3) whether such person or the opposing party,

or either party’s representative, engaged in conduct

injunctive relief, in any court of the United States having

jurisdiction over the parties, against threatened loss or

threatened conduct that will cause loss or damage is 
10
granted by courts of equity, under the rules governing
