•HR 2660 IH
(1) In June 2015, the Corps of Engineers and 
1
the Environmental Protection Agency published a 
2
final rule (hereinafter referred to as the ‘‘2015 
3
WOTUS rule’’) to revise regulations defining the 
4
scope of waters protected and regulated under the 
5
Clean Water Act. 
6
(2) The 2015 WOTUS rule significantly ex-
7
panded the scope of Federal jurisdiction under the 
8
Clean Water Act over virtually all waters and wet 
9
areas in the United States. 
10
(3) On April 21, 2020, the Environmental Pro-
11
tection Agency and the Corps of Engineers revisited 
12
the 2015 WOTUS rule and finalized a revised defi-
13
nition of the term ‘‘waters of the United States’’ to 
14
address legal, economic, and jurisdictional concerns 
15
surrounding the previous definition. 
16
(4) The 2015 WOTUS rule infringed on the 
17
rights of property owners, particularly in agricul-
18
tural communities, and represented an alarming reg-
19
ulatory overreach of the executive branch into poli-
20
cies that should be addressed by the legislative 
21
branch through the legislative process. 
22
SEC. 3. DEFINITION.
