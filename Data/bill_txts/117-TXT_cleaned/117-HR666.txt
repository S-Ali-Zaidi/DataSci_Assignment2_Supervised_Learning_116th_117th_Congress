Whereas Rail Safety Week was launched to raise awareness 
about the need for increased education on how to be safe 
around highway-rail grade crossings and railroad tracks 
and to highlight efforts to further reduce collisions, inju-
ries, and fatalities; 
Whereas highway-rail grade crossing and trespassing acci-
dents constituted approximately 96 percent of all rail-re-
lated fatalities during 2020; 
Whereas, since 2005— 
(1) the number of public highway-rail grade cross-
ings has decreased by 9.8 percent; and 
(2) the number of gates at such crossings has in-
creased by 38.1 percent; 
Whereas, in 2020, 47 percent of all highway-rail grade cross-
ing collisions and 69 percent of all fatal highway-rail 
grade crossing collisions occurred at gated highway-rail 
grade crossings; 
Whereas preliminary Federal statistics indicate that 1,901 
highway-grade crossing collisions occurred in the United 
States in 2020, resulting in 198 deaths and another 685 
individuals injured; 
Whereas many collisions between trains and motor vehicles or 
pedestrians could have been prevented by increased edu-
cation, engineering, and enforcement; 
Whereas Operation Lifesaver, the foremost public information 
and education program on rail safety, administers a pub-
lic education program about grade-crossing safety and 
trespassing prevention; 
Whereas, during Rail Safety Week, from September 20 
through 26, and throughout the year, everyone is encour-

aged to take added caution as motorists or pedestrians 
approach tracks or trains; 
Whereas the United States, Canada, and Mexico will concur-
rently observe Rail Safety Week; and

safety awareness and a reduction in highway-rail grade 
crossing collisions and other railroad incidents: Now, 
therefore, be it
