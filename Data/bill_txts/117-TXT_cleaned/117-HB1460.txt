SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
7
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
8
(1) Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas 
9
produced by burning any fuel. Exposure to 
10

•HR 1460 IH
unhealthy levels of carbon monoxide can lead to car-
1
bon monoxide poisoning, a serious health condition 
2
that could result in death. 
3
(2) Unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning 
4
from motor vehicles and improper operation of fuel- 
5
burning appliances, such as furnaces, water heaters, 
6
portable generators, and stoves, annually kills more 
7
than 400 individuals and sends approximately 
8
15,000 individuals to hospital emergency rooms for 
9
treatment. 
10
(3) Research shows that installing carbon mon-
11
oxide alarms close to the sleeping areas in residen-
12
tial homes and other dwelling units can help avoid 
13
fatalities. 
14
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
15
gress that Congress should promote the installation of car-
16
bon monoxide alarms in residential homes and dwelling 
17
units across the United States in order to promote the 
18
health and public safety of citizens throughout the United 
19
