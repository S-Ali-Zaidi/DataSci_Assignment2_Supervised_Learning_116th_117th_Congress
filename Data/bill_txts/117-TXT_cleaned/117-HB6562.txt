A BILL 
To amend the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to require the 
Secretary of Energy to create a plan for research, devel-
opment, and commercialization projects capable of mak-
ing significant reductions in global greenhouse gas emis-
sions or carbon intensity of qualified fuel production 
facilities, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

‘‘(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 180 days after 
13
the date of enactment of this section, the Secretary of En-
14
ergy shall transmit to the Congress a plan outlining oppor-
15
tunities for research, development and commercialization 
16
projects capable of making significant reductions in global 
17
greenhouse gas emissions and/or carbon intensity of quali-
18
fied fuel production facilities, including a road map for 
19
advancing the readiness level of such technologies from 
20
laboratory scale to industrial use for the 5-year period be-
21
ginning on the date of the submission of the plan. 
22
‘‘(b) PROGRAM.—Not later than 180 days after the 
23
Secretary submits the plan under subsection (a) to Con-

not limited to energy usage reductions, use of ad-
4
vanced catalysts, electrification of heat and steam 
5
generation, hydrogen firing, low grade waste heat re-
6
covery, membrane separations, and other process im-

‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—In carrying out the pro-
16
gram under subsection (b), the Secretary may award 
17
funds for commercial-scale demonstration projects 
18
for qualified fuel production facilities that test the 
19
scale of technology necessary for commercial oper-
20
ation, in accordance with this subsection.
