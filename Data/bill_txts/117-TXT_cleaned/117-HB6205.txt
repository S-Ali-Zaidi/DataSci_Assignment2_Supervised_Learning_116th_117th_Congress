A BILL 
To reauthorize title II of the Higher Education Act of 1965, 
and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘EDUCATORS for 
4
America Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Despite an increased need for prekinder-
8
garten through grade 12 teachers, the number of 
9

•HR 6205 IH
students completing bachelor’s degrees in education 
1
has been in decline over the last 2 decades. 
2
(2) Pay is by far the reason that undergradu-
3
ates cite most often for not pursuing teaching as a 
4
career. Pay was named as such a reason by 72 per-
5
cent of respondents in a large 2018 survey of pro-
6
spective college students. 
7
(3) Because they earn less than other bachelor’s 
8
degree recipients, teachers face particular challenges 
9
repaying student loans. Estimated payments on the 
10
average amount education graduates have borrowed 
11
is equivalent to 9 percent of the average starting 
12
teacher salary, well in excess of the 7 percent 
13
threshold recommended by economists as affordable 
14
for borrowers at that income level. 
15
(4) The number of students earning under-
16
graduate and graduate degrees in the high-demand 
17
specialties of mathematics, science, and foreign lan-
18
guage education are in decline and the numbers 
19
earning degrees in special education and teaching 
20
English as a second language are insufficient to 
21
meet demand in many localities. 
22
(5) Prior to COVID–19, the number of institu-
23
tions offering degrees in education was stable, but 
24
the number with small programs was on the rise. 
25

•HR 6205 IH
One-third of the 1,500 institutions that award bach-
1
elor’s and master’s degrees in education granted 30 
2
or fewer such degrees in 2019. 
3
(6) An October 2020 survey of American Asso-
4
ciation of Colleges for Teacher Education members, 
5
which includes 700 schools, colleges, and depart-
6
ments of education at public and private 4-year col-
7
leges and universities, revealed that nearly 60 per-
8
cent have experienced a decline in undergraduate en-
9
rollment due to COVID–19, 83 percent have had 
10
budget cuts, and half have reduced staffing. The As-
11
sociation predicts that, absent additional support, a 
12
sizable number of educator preparation programs 
13
will close, eliminating needed capacity to produce the 
14
profession-ready teachers that the Nation needs. 
15
(7) A 2015 Government Accountability Office 
16
analysis showed that only 19 percent of students 
17
who were eligible for the Federal Teacher Education 
18
Assistance for College and Higher Education Grant 
19
program (referred to as ‘‘TEACH Grants’’) in the 
20
2013–2014 academic year utilized this program, yet 
21
the cost of college remains a barrier for many stu-
22
dents who seek to become teachers. Institutions like 
23
the University of Northern Iowa have successfully 
24
utilized TEACH Grants for 57 percent of its 
25
22:37 Dec 17, 2021
H6205
4 
•HR 6205 IH
TEACH Grant-eligible teacher candidates, with over 
1
one thousand moving into teaching positions in high- 
2
need fields in high-need schools. 
3
(8) Only 22 percent of educators feel they are 
4
‘‘very prepared’’ to teach social and emotional learn-
5
ing in classrooms, and 51 percent report that the 
6
level of social and emotional learning professional 
7
development offered at their school is not sufficient. 
8
(9) Our Nation’s schools are experiencing a se-
9
vere diversity gap that negatively impacts student 
10
achievement and school culture. Fifty percent of cur-
11
rent students are from minority groups while only 
12
18 percent of teachers are from such groups, accord-
13
ing to a 2016 study by the Brookings Institution. 
14
(10) A 2016 report conducted by the Depart-
15
ment of Education shows that teachers of color tend 
16
to provide more culturally relevant teaching and bet-
17
ter understand the situations that students of color 
18
may face. These factors help develop trusting teach-
19
er-student relationships. Researchers from Vander-
20
bilt University also found that greater racial and 
21
ethnic diversity among school principals benefits stu-
22
dents, especially students of color. 
23
(11) Research shows that increasing diversity in 
24
the teaching profession can have positive impacts on 
25
22:37 Dec 17, 2021
H6205
5 
•HR 6205 IH
student educational experiences and outcomes. Stu-
1
dents of color demonstrate greater academic achieve-
2
ment and social-emotional development in classes 
3
with teachers of color. Studies also suggest that all 
4
students, including White students, benefit from 
5
having teachers of color because they bring distinc-
6
tive knowledge, experiences, and role modeling to the 
7
student body as a whole. 
8
(12) Effective school leadership is second only 
9
to direct classroom instruction among school-based 
10
factors in raising student achievement, and principal 
11
impact is greatest in low-achieving, high-poverty, 
12
and minority schools. 
13
(13) Principals improve teaching and learning 
14
through their ability— 
15
(A) to shape a vision of academic success 
16
for all students; 
17
(B) to create a safe and supportive school 
18
climate; 
19
(C) to cultivate leadership among teachers 
20
and other school staff; 
21
(D) to improve instruction; and 
22
(E) to manage people, data, and processes 
23
to foster school improvement.

22:37 Dec 17, 2021

•HR 6205 IH
(14) Recent research from the Wallace Founda-
1
tion on principals’ impact on students and schools 
2
notes that it is difficult to envision a higher return 
3
on investment in kindergarten through grade 12 
4
education than the cultivation of high-quality school 
5
leadership. 
6
(15) In the 2015–2016 school year, only 22 
7
percent of public school principals were individuals 
8
of color, including 11 percent who identified as 
9
Black and 8 percent who identified as Hispanic. 
10
(16) Minority teachers, school leaders, and 
11
other educators can also serve as cultural ambas-
12
sadors who help students feel more welcome at 
13
school or as role models.
