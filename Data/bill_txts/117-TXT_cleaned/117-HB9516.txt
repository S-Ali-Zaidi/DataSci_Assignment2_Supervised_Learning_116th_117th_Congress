A BILL 
To support national training, technical assistance, and re-
source centers, to ensure that all individuals with signifi-
cant expressive communication disabilities have access 
to the augmentative and alternative communication the 
individuals need to interact with others, in order to learn, 
work, socialize, and take advantage of all aspects of 
life in the United States. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Augmentative and Al-
2
ternative Communication Centers to Establish National 
3
Training Act’’ or the ‘‘AACCENT Act’’. 
4
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
5
Congress makes the following findings: 
6
(1) Communication is a basic human need and 
7
fundamental right, and is essential to self-deter-
8
mination, social inclusion, and emotional and phys-
9
ical well-being. In enacting a provision of the Ameri-
10
cans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (referred to in 
11
this section as the ‘‘ADA’’), Congress recognized 
12
that ‘‘physical or mental disabilities in no way di-
13
minish a person’s right to fully participate in all as-
14
pects of society,’’ and that ‘‘the discriminatory ef-
15
fects of communication barriers’’ are a form of dis-
16
crimination. 
17
(2) Three decades after the passage of the 
18
ADA, Americans with significant expressive commu-
19
nication disabilities still experience discrimination in 
20
the form of communication barriers, institutionaliza-
21
tion, segregation, and relegation to lesser services, 
22
programs, activities, benefits, jobs, or other opportu-
23
nities compared to Americans without significant ex-
24
pressive communication disabilities. 
25

•HR 9516 IH
(3) Data about augmentative and alternative 
1
communication is lacking, but it is estimated there 
2
are at least 4,000,000 people in the United States 
3
who cannot reliably meet their daily communication 
4
needs using natural speech. 
5
(4) The population of individuals with signifi-
6
cant expressive communication difficulties is at sub-
7
stantial risk for limited education, unemployment, 
8
poor health outcomes, poverty, and low quality of 
9
life. 
10
(5) People can acquire a significant expressive 
11
communication disability and need augmentative and 
12
alternative communication as a result of many 
13
health and developmental conditions at all stages of 
14
life. 
15
(6) Research indicates that individuals who be-
16
long to racial or ethnic minority communities face a 
17
greater likelihood of being born with or acquiring ex-
18
pressive communication disabilities, as well as added 
19
difficulties in obtaining intervention services, includ-
20
ing augmentative and alternative communication. 
21
(7) Individuals with significant expressive com-
22
munication disabilities, schools, families, employers, 
23
direct support providers, health care providers, the 
24
justice system, and the general public need more in-

formation about how to effectively deploy, imple-
1
ment, and ensure continued access to robust commu-
2
nication tools, services, and other supports for indi-
3
viduals with significant expressive communication 
4
disabilities. 
5
(8) The lived experiences and writings of indi-
6
viduals with significant expressive communication 
7
disabilities demonstrate the positive impact aug-
8
mentative and alternative communication has on 
9
their lives. These lived experiences and writings also 
10
illustrate the harm that results from denying aug-
11
mentative and alternative communication to those 
12
who need it. 
13
(9) The leadership of individuals with signifi-
14
cant expressive communication disabilities is critical 
15
in crafting and implementing effective policies and 
16
programs affecting their lives, including policies and 
17
programs regarding augmentative and alternative 
18
communication. 
19
(10) The freedoms of expression, and to be un-
20
derstood, are essential to both democracy and to in-
21
dividual well-being. Individuals with significant ex-
22
pressive communication disabilities must be afforded 
23
equal rights, opportunities, strategies, technologies, 
24
services, and other supports to effectively express

SEC. 3. PURPOSE. 
3

4
