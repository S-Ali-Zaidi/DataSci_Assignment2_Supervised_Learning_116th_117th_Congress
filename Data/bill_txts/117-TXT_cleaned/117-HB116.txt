A BILL 
To require that activities carried out by the United States 
in South Sudan relating to governance, reconstruction 
and development, and refugee relief and assistance sup-
port the basic human rights of women and women’s 
participation and leadership in these areas. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Equal Rights and Ac-
4
cess for the Women of South Sudan Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress makes the following findings:

•HR 116 IH
(1) Despite the 2011 referendum for secession 
1
that established the independent state of South 
2
Sudan, South Sudanese women continue to experi-
3
ence brutal violation of their human rights. 
4
(2) Strong and continued United States support 
5
can ensure that the advances made by South Suda-
6
nese women since July 2011 when the Republic of 
7
South Sudan gained its independence will continue 
8
and grow, rather than recede. 
9
(3) The United States has made a substantial 
10
contribution to the emergency relief and humani-
11
tarian efforts for South Sudan. Completing the 
12
United States mission in South Sudan will also re-
13
quire significant and long-term investments in devel-
14
opment and reconstruction assistance. 
15
(4) An inadequate healthcare system has re-
16
sulted in high maternal and infant mortality rates. 
17
The maternal mortality rate is 1,054 deaths per 
18
100,000 live births, making it one of the highest in 
19
the world. 
20
(5) South Sudan faces many difficulties with its 
21
lack of infrastructure and lacks significant human 
22
development factors, which can further marginalize 
23
women.

•HR 116 IH
(6) Over 80 percent of women and girls in 
1
South Sudan are illiterate, and thus it is imperative 
2
to both secure and inform women’s rights within the 
3
national development. 
4
(7) With the assistance of internal aid and the 
5
proliferation of local women’s organizations, wom-
6
en’s equality can be integrated into South Sudan’s 
7
nation-building efforts. 
8
(8) South Sudan has made gains in incor-
9
porating women into the new regime with efforts 
10
such as inclusion in the legislative assembly, thus 
11
additional support from the United States serves to 
12
reinforce these ideals and implementations. 
13
(9) The women of South Sudan are taking the 
14
initiative to reach across the conflict divide and fos-
15
ter peace. Women’s perspectives and experiences in 
16
seeking solutions to conflicts are necessary to ensure 
17
lasting peace. 
18
(10) Adequate security in both urban and rural 
19
areas, particularly on military borders, is essential if 
20
women and girls are to exercise their human rights, 
21
work, attend school, and otherwise participate in and 
22
benefit from humanitarian and development pro-
23
grams sponsored by the United States.
