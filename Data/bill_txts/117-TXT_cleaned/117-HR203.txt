RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the President of the United States should take Executive 
action to declare National COVID–19 Vaccination 
Awareness Day as a one-time Federal holiday to act 
as a galvanizing moment to promote the more rapid 
distribution of COVID–19 vaccines to all areas of the 
country, show appreciation for the heroic partnership 
between government and health care stakeholders to de-
velop effective and safe vaccines in record time, and 
increase public awareness of the important role vaccina-

tion can play for a return to normalcy as soon as pos-
sible. 
Whereas, starting in 2020, COVID–19 created a global pan-
demic that has had a catastrophic impact on human life, 
our communities, and our economy; 
Whereas COVID–19 has caused more than 2,500,000 deaths 
across the globe and more than 500,000 deaths in the 
United States; 
Whereas COVID–19 has caused not only a public health cri-
sis, but also an unprecedented economic crisis in the 
United States that has led to business closures, high un-
employment rates, and a reduction in the production of 
goods and services; 
Whereas due to COVID–19, the United States Gross Domes-
tic Product decreased 3.5 percent in 2020, the largest 
year-over-year decrease since 1946 and recorded its 
steepest quarterly drop in economic output on record, a 
decrease of 9.1 percent in the second quarter of 2020; 
Whereas, the American people have struggled to live through 
one of the country’s most tragic years, but should remain 
cautious until we can reach herd immunity and vaccinate 
most of the population to keep our family, friends, and 
colleagues safe; 
Whereas, the country’s battle with COVID–19 is not over, 
but there is reason for optimism to return to normalcy 
in the near future; 
Whereas the House of Representatives recognizes the efforts 
of Operation Warp Speed, which through American will-
power, ingenuity, and might was able to develop multiple 
vaccines with record-breaking speed because of the pri-

vate-public partnership facilitated by the United States 
Government; 
Whereas despite confusion and misinformation about avail-
able vaccines, they are an important part of family and 
public health and prevent the spread of dangerous and 
deadly contagious diseases; 
Whereas it has been scientifically established that the 
COVID–19 vaccines are highly effective in preventing 
vaccine recipients from developing severe or life-threat-
ening symptoms and will help to protect Americans from 
COVID–19; 
Whereas mass vaccination programs have been highly suc-
cessful in reducing the 57,000,000 deaths caused by in-
fectious diseases in the world each year; 
Whereas we are in a galvanizing moment for our country, 
with the promise of more vaccine supplies and better dis-
tribution avenues that will lead to a return to normalcy; 
Whereas the delivery of the vaccine to the American public 
requires precise coordination across Federal, State, local, 
Tribal, and territorial governments and many public and 
private partners to ensure that every American who 
wants to receive a COVID–19 vaccine can receive one; 
Whereas the House of Representatives commends the cre-
ativity, innovation, and willingness of local, county, and 
State efforts to distribute vaccines to all areas of the 
country through a variety of venues, to cities and rural 
communities alike, while also striving to maximize effi-
ciency and prevent any waste; 
Whereas the House of Representatives encourages Federal, 
State, local, Tribal, and territorial governments and pub-

lic and private stakeholders to take these successful mod-
els and continue to improve upon vaccine distribution; 
Whereas the House of Representatives recognizes the heroic 
effort undertaken by our health care workers, first re-
sponders and leaders at all levels working together to re-
alize a truly American accomplishment of developing vac-
cines in record time, working to effectively distribute the 
vaccine, and collectively aim to have a majority of the 
country vaccinated this summer; 
Whereas the House of Representatives recognizes the impor-
tance of public health awareness campaigns and a mass 
vaccination program for the betterment of the American 
public; and 
Whereas the House of Representatives understands the im-
portance of returning to normalcy through a mass vac-
cination program for the American people and the econ-
omy to recover from the devastating effects of COVID– 
19: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
