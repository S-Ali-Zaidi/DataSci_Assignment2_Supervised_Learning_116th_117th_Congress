Whereas Hurricane Maria is the second deadliest storm in re-
corded United States history after the Great Galveston 
Hurricane of 1900; 
Whereas the people of Puerto Rico living on both the main-
land United States and the island have shown an incred-
ible and resilient spirit in rebuilding after their record 
losses; 
Whereas Puerto Rico faced one of the longest blackouts in 
United States history, where millions of residents were 
left without power and basic services for nearly a year, 
triggering physical and mental health, migration, hous-
ing, and infrastructure crises; 
Whereas four years since Hurricane Maria made landfall in 
Puerto Rico, the electrical grid on the island remains un-
reliable leaving millions without a secure source of power 
as they suffer intermittent brownouts and blackouts; 
Whereas thousands of people in Puerto Rico and the U.S. 
Virgin Islands still have blue tarps over their roofs due 
to the impacts of Hurricanes Maria and Irma; 
Whereas hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans were up-
rooted and some have relocated to the mainland United 
States as a result of Hurricane Maria; 
Whereas hundreds of Puerto Ricans displaced by Hurricane 
Maria continue to need housing assistance from the terri-
torial and Federal Government due to unaddressed dam-
age to their homes on the island; 
Whereas Puerto Rico’s economic health continues to waiver 
as the preexisting debt crisis was exacerbated by the im-
pact of Hurricane Maria;

Whereas Hurricane Maria is the third most costly United 
States tropical cyclone recorded, with damages estimated 
at $98,100,000,000; 
Whereas the Federal Government has allocated almost 
$72,000,000,000 in disaster relief funding to help the 
people of Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Is-
lands rebuild from disasters since Hurricane Maria 
struck; 
Whereas the official death toll from Hurricane Maria now 
stands at 2,975 victims in Puerto Rico, although some 
academic estimates place the toll at 4,645; 
Whereas many of the underlying vulnerabilities contributing 
to the massive death toll on the Island, such as an under-
funded healthcare system and a shortage of medical phy-
sicians and specialists are still present; 
Whereas the over 8,000 residents of the island municipality 
of Vieques, Puerto Rico lost their primary hospital and 
to this date, do not have an adequate and comprehensive 
healthcare facility; 
Whereas the Federal Emergency and Management Agency 
(FEMA) Office of the Inspector General found in a Sep-
tember 2020 report FEMA mismanaged the distribution 
of commodities in response to Hurricanes Irma and 
Maria in Puerto Rico; 
Whereas it is known that FEMA lost visibility of approxi-
mately 38 percent of its commodity shipments to Puerto 
Rico, worth an estimated $257,000,000; 
Whereas the Department of Housing and Urban Develop-
ment (HUD) Office of the Inspector General found in an 
April 2021 report the Trump administration created bu-
reaucratic 
hurdles
