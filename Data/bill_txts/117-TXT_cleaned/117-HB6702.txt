A BILL 
To require more accurate reporting of abortion drug pre-
scribing and related adverse events, and for other pur-
poses. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Safeguarding Women’s 
4
and Children’s Health Act of 2022’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

The Congress finds the following:

•HR 6702 IH
(1) Many data limitations affect the accuracy of 
1
statistics related to chemical abortions in the United 
2
States, and there is no central database tracking 
3
this information. 
4
(2) States may voluntarily choose to share abor-
5
tion data with the Centers for Disease Control and 
6
Prevention (CDC), but the Guttmacher Institute, 
7
which directly surveys abortion providers, consist-
8
ently documents 30 to 40 percent more abortions 
9
than the CDC. 
10
(3) Some States with high volumes of abortion, 
11
such as California, do not report to the CDC. 
12
(4) Only 28 States require abortion providers to 
13
report complications, but there is rarely an enforced 
14
penalty for noncompliance. Only 12 States require 
15
other physicians, coroners, or emergency rooms to 
16
report complications or deaths for investigation, and 
17
frequently these facilities and physicians are un-
18
aware of these reporting requirements. 
19
(5) These data problems are a significant limi-
20
tation to United States studies on abortion complica-
21
tions. 
22
(6) Women experiencing complications will 
23
often present to an emergency room rather than re-
24
turn to the abortion provider, and researchers fre-
25
02:21 Feb 17, 2022
H6702

•HR 6702 IH
quently ignore the difficulty in obtaining accurate 
1
International Classification of Diseases coding in 
2
emergency rooms due to search engine failure to dis-
3
cover induced abortion codes, which leads to 
4
miscoding and frequently attributing induced abor-
5
tion complications to spontaneous abortions. 
6
(7) When compared to surgical abortions, chem-
7
ical abortions are over 50 percent more likely to re-
8
sult in an abortion-related visit to an emergency 
9
room, and by 2015, 60 percent of chemical abortion- 
10
related emergency room visits were incorrectly coded 
11
as miscarriages. 
12
(8) Better quality, international records-link-
13
ages studies, and meta-analyses document far higher 
14
rates of complications and mortality from abortion, 
15
casting doubt on the validity of the reported data by 
16
which United States public health decisions are 
17
made. 
18
(9) Independent systematic analysis of adverse 
19
event reports submitted to the Food and Drug Ad-
20
ministration (FDA) between 2000 and 2019 re-
21
vealed approximately 3,000 United States adverse 
22
events out of an expected 185,000 adverse events 
23
based on the known and published complication rate 
24
after mifepristone misoprostol abortions. Thus, the 
25
02:21 Feb 17, 2022
H6702
4 
•HR 6702 IH
Adverse Event Reporting System of the FDA cap-
1
tured only 1.7 percent of the actual adverse events 
2
occurring in United States women, the majority of 
3
which occurred prior to 2016 when mifepristone pre-
4
scribers were required to report adverse events as 
5
part of the risk evaluation and mitigation strategy. 
6
(10) In 2016, the FDA relaxed the gestational 
7
age dispensing from a limitation of 7 weeks gesta-
8
tion to a limitation of 10 weeks gestation, and at the 
9
same time the FDA no longer required mifepristone 
10
prescribers to report adverse events other than 
11
death. These simultaneous changes ensured that 
12
there would be no way to capture the increased ad-
13
verse events resulting from the relaxation of the ges-
14
tational age requirements. 
15
(11) In order to fulfil the statutory requirement 
16
of the FDA to oversee and evaluate the safety of 
17
mifepristone use as an abortifacient, substantial 
18
changes 
in 
the 
adverse 
event 
reporting 
for 
19
mifepristone must be implemented to obtain an ac-
20
curate evaluation of the impact of mifepristone-re-
21
lated adverse events on United States women.
