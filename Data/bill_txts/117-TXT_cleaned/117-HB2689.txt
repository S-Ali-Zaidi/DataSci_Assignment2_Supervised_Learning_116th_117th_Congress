SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. 
1
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) During times of economic downturn or re-
3
cession, communities of color, and businesses within 
4
those communities, are generally more adversely af-
5
fected, which requires an expansion of the ability of 
6
the Federal Government to infuse resources into 
7
those communities. 
8
(2) Despite the growth in the number of minor-
9
ity business enterprises, gaps remain with respect to 
10
key metrics for those enterprises, such as access to 
11
capital, revenue, number of employees, and survival 
12
rate. Specifically— 
13
(A) according to the Department of Com-
14
merce, minority business enterprises are 2 to 3 
15
times more likely to be denied loans than non- 
16
minority business enterprises; 
17
(B) according to the Bureau of the Cen-
18
sus, the average non-minority business enter-
19
prise reports receipts that are more than 3 
20
23:37 Jun 02, 2021
H2689
4 
•HR 2689 IH
times higher than receipts reported by the aver-
1
age minority business enterprise; and 
2
(C) according to the Kauffman Founda-
3
tion— 
4
(i) minority business enterprises are 
5
1⁄2 as likely to employ individuals, as com-
6
pared with non-minority business enter-
7
prises; and 
8
(ii) if minorities started and owned 
9
businesses at the same rate as non-minori-
10
ties, the United States economy would 
11
have more than 1,000,000 additional em-
12
ployer businesses and more than 9,500,000 
13
additional jobs. 
14
(3) Because of the conditions described in para-
15
graph (2), it is in the interest of the United States 
16
and the economy of the United States to expedi-
17
tiously ameliorate the disparities that minority busi-
18
ness enterprises experience. 
19
(4) Many individuals who own minority busi-
20
ness enterprises are socially disadvantaged because 
21
those individuals identify as members of certain 
22
groups that have suffered the effects of discrimina-
23
tory practices or similar circumstances over which 
24
23:37 Jun 02, 2021
H2689
5 
•HR 2689 IH
those individuals have no control, including individ-
1
uals who are— 
2
(A) Black or African American; 
3
(B) Hispanic or Latino; 
4
(C) American Indian or Alaska Native; 
5
(D) Asian; and 
6
(E) Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Is-
7
lander. 
8
(5) Discriminatory practices and similar cir-
9
cumstances described in paragraph (4) are a signifi-
10
cant determinant of overall economic disadvantage 
11
in the United States, which is evident in the per-
12
sistent racial wealth gap in the United States. 
13
(6) While other Federal agencies focus only on 
14
small businesses and businesses that represent a 
15
broader demographic than solely minority business 
16
enterprises, the Agency focuses exclusively on— 
17
(A) the unique needs of minority business 
18
enterprises; and 
19
(B) enhancing the capacity of minority 
20
business enterprises. 
21
(b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this Act are to— 
22
(1) require the Agency to promote and admin-
23
ister programs in the public and private sectors to

5
