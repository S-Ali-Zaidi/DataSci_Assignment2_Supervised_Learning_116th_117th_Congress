RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the benefits of natural gas to the United States 
economy and environment, and recognizing natural gas 
as an affordable and ‘‘green’’ energy. 
Whereas proposals to implement punitive fees on methane 
emissions would result in a regressive tax on all Ameri-
cans, including low-income and fixed-income Americans; 
Whereas a natural gas tax or methane emissions fee would 
result in higher bills on natural gas customers, including 
families, farmers, and small businesses; 
Whereas any natural gas tax or methane emissions fee would 
disproportionately impact natural gas producing regions,

and businesses across the natural gas supply would be 
harmed by government-imposed taxes and fees; 
Whereas, since 2005, two-thirds of the power sector green-
house gas emissions reductions are a direct result of the 
switch to natural gas; 
Whereas, because of increased innovation and technology in 
the natural gas industry, United States methane emis-
sions were 10 percent lower in 2020 compared to 2005, 
despite the United States increasing production of nat-
ural gas by nearly 100 percent between 2005 to 2020; 
Whereas, according to the Energy Information Administra-
tion, using natural gas to generate energy results in 
fewer emissions of nearly all types of air pollutants, in-
cluding carbon dioxide, compared to other fossil fuels; 
Whereas, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, 
since 1970, combined emissions of criteria and precursor 
pollutants have dropped by 78 percent in the United 
States; 
Whereas, on March 9, 2022, the European Commission ap-
proved a Complementary Climate Delegated Act that 
specifies certain nuclear and natural gas activities are 
covered by the European Union taxonomy and thus con-
sidered ‘‘green’’ investments; 
Whereas the European Commission’s Complementary Climate 
Delegated Act allows natural gas and nuclear energy ac-
tivities to be considered as renewable or green invest-
ments, which will spur private and public investments in 
natural gas and nuclear energy and make Europe less re-
liant on Russian energy in the future; 
Whereas, on March 25, 2022, the United States announced 
an agreement with the European Union for the United

States to supply the European Union with up to 
15,000,000,000 additional cubic meters of liquefied nat-
ural gas by the end of 2022; 
Whereas, in 2021, 45 percent of the European Union’s nat-
ural gas imports were from Russia, accounting for 
155,000,000,000 cubic meters of liquefied natural gas; 
Whereas the Biden administration and Congress must reduce 
regulatory burdens and increase the production of United 
States natural gas in order to export clean United States 
natural gas to help reduce the European Union’s reliance 
on Russian energy; 
Whereas increased usage of natural gas domestically will also 
reduce United States dependence on foreign energy and 
strengthen United States national security; and 
Whereas natural gas is abundant in the United States, and 
the Energy Information Administration estimates the 
United States has enough dry natural gas to last nearly 
a century, and the potential for even more with advances 
in technology and exploration: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) recognizes natural gas produced in the 
2
United States as an affordable and ‘‘green’’ energy; 
3
(2) recognizes that the United States should be 
4
committed to an ‘‘all of the above’’ approach to meet 
5
United States energy needs, and that natural gas is 
6
necessary for the United States to be energy inde-
7
pendent; and

(3) encourages the Biden administration, in-
