the United States and expressing the sense of the House 
of Representatives regarding comprehensive reproductive

Whereas the Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized that 
any concept of liberty must include the right to make

personal decisions about bodily integrity, autonomy, fam-
ily, and relationships; 
Whereas June 7, 2022, marks the 57th anniversary of the 
landmark Griswold v. Connecticut (381 U.S. 479 (1965)) 
decision in which the Supreme Court first held that the 
Constitution protects the right to use contraception; 
Whereas Eisenstadt v. Baird (405 U.S. 438 (1972)) con-
firmed the constitutional right of all people to legally ac-
cess contraception regardless of marital status; 
Whereas Roe v. Wade (410 U.S. 113 (1973)) established that 
the constitutional right to privacy includes the right to 
abortion; 
Whereas the Supreme Court is now (as of the date of adop-
tion of this resolution) considering Dobbs v. Jackson 
Women’s Health Organization (141 S.Ct. 2619 (2021)), 
a case that the Justices could use to overturn or severely 
undermine Roe v. Wade; 
Whereas a leaked draft opinion of the majority opinion in 
Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization signals 
the intent of the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. 
Wade; 
Whereas the gutting or overturning of Roe v. Wade threatens 
precedent protecting marital, familial, and sexual privacy, 
including the right to contraception, that has been re-
peatedly affirmed by the Supreme Court, including in 
Obergefell v. Hodges (576 U.S. 644 (2015)), and relied 
upon in this country for almost 60 years; 
Whereas the overturning of Roe v. Wade will activate ‘‘trig-
ger laws’’ in various States that would create a near-total 
ban on abortion and, in some States, make performing an 
abortion a felony under State law, and as of this writing,

•HRES 1155 IH 
13 States have already passed trigger laws, while other 
States have introduced trigger laws in their State legisla-
tures; 
Whereas the Office of Women’s Health within the Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services defines contracep-
tion as ‘‘any method, medicine, or device used to prevent 
pregnancy’’, and the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration iden-
tify a wide variety of drugs and devices as meeting this 
definition, including emergency contraceptives and intra-
uterine devices; 
Whereas States have attempted to define abortion expansively 
so as to include contraception in State bans on abortion 
and have also restricted access to emergency contracep-
tion; 
Whereas access to contraception is crucial to people’s ability 
to decide if and when to have children and control their 
own bodies and well-being; 
Whereas the United States has a long history of reproductive 
coercion, including the childbearing forced upon enslaved 
women, as well as the forced sterilization of Black 
women, Puerto Rican women, indigenous women, immi-
grant women, and disabled women, and that these abuses 
continue to occur; 
Whereas contraception is key to sexual and reproductive 
health, as it prevents unintended pregnancy, is highly ef-
fective in preventing and treating a wide array of often 
severe medical conditions, and decreases the risk of cer-
tain cancers;

Whereas family planning improves health outcomes for 
women, their families, and their communities and reduces 
rates of maternal and infant mortality and morbidity; 
Whereas the ability to prevent, plan, and space pregnancies 
is critical to people’s educational attainment and eco-
nomic advancement, and has been vital to advancing 
equal opportunity and economic security for women; 
Whereas fully one-third of the wage gains women have made 
since the 1960s are the result of access to oral contracep-
tives; 
Whereas access to comprehensive reproductive health care, 
including contraception and abortion, is essential to wom-
en’s equality under the law; 
Whereas the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act 
(commonly referred to as the ‘‘ACA’’) requires that most 
insurance plans cover evidence-based preventive services 
for women, including contraception without cost sharing, 
and the Department of Health and Human Services esti-
mates that 62,000,000 women have this coverage; 
Whereas the ACA’s contraceptive coverage requirement has 
been under attack from and undermined by those who 
would allow employers to dictate contraceptive decision-
making for employees; 
Whereas restrictions on contraceptive access deny people the 
ability to determine when and if to become pregnant, 
make essential health care cost prohibitive, and infringe 
on people’s constitutional rights; 
Whereas contraceptive care and coverage restrictions dis-
proportionately impact people of color, working class and 
low-income people, LGBTQ people, immigrants, young 
people, and people with disabilities;

Whereas title X is the only Federal program dedicated to 
providing family planning services for people with low in-
comes, but has come under increasing attack in the past 
10 years; 
Whereas providers’ refusals to offer contraception based on 
their own personal beliefs impede patients from obtaining 
their preferred method, with laws in 12 States specifically 
allowing health care providers to refuse to provide serv-
ices related to contraception; 
Whereas violations of the Medicaid free choice of provider re-
quirement, thus far in Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri, 
and Texas, infringe on people’s ability to access their 
contraceptive care; 
Whereas insurance plans and pharmacy benefit managers fail 
to comply with the contraception coverage requirement, 
with insurance plans routinely refusing to cover certain 
contraceptive products, imposing administrative hurdles 
like prior authorizations and step therapy, and requiring 
unallowable patient cost sharing; and 
Whereas any policy that restricts contraception, including 
long-acting reversible contraceptive methods and emer-
gency contraception, erodes existing legal protections 
thereof, or limits coverage thereof, imperils people’s re-
ceipt of essential health services and the associated gains 
in social equality: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) affirms that people deserve access to the 
2
contraception and related services that they want or 
3
need, when they want or need them, without any ob-

stacles;
