A BILL 
To require the Secretary of Health and Human Services 
to establish a new program which ensures meaningful 
access to claims data by clinician-led clinical data reg-
istries, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This part may be cited as the ‘‘Meaningful Access 
4

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds as follows:

•HR 5394 IH
(1) Clinician-led clinical data registries serve an 
1
important role in promoting, facilitating, and con-
2
ducting medical research and improving quality of 
3
healthcare by providing timely and actionable feed-
4
back to practitioners on their performance in rela-
5
tion to other practitioners and best clinical practices. 
6
(2) Clinician-led clinical data registries are hin-
7
dered in their ability to promote medical research 
8
and quality improvement by their lack of meaningful 
9
access to claims data. 
10
(3) While the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid 
11
Services has established programs for providing ac-
12
cess to claims data, those programs fail to provide 
13
clinician-led clinical data registries with meaningful 
14
access to such data. 
15
(4) Ensuring clinician-led clinical data reg-
16
istries meaningful access to claims data will enable 
17
such entities to better track patient outcomes over 
18
time, expand their ability to assess the safety and ef-
19
fectiveness of medical treatments, and provide them 
20
with the information necessary to assess the cost-ef-
21
fectiveness of therapies.
