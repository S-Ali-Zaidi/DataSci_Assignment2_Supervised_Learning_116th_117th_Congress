RESOLUTION 
Supporting the designation of September 17, 2021, as ‘‘Na-
tional Physician Suicide Awareness Day’’ to raise aware-
ness of, and promote a national discussion about, physi-
cian suicide and to reduce the stigma of mental health 
issues. 
Whereas, prior to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID–19) 
pandemic, numerous health care workers suffered from 
work-related burnout and depression; 
Whereas physicians work under intense pressure and are ex-
posed to trauma on the job; 
Whereas the suicide rate among—

(1) male physicians is 1.41 times higher than the 
general male population; and 
(2) female physicians is even more pronounced, 
being 2.27 times higher than the general female popu-
lation; 
Whereas physicians, nurses, and allied health providers serv-
ing on the frontlines of the COVID–19 pandemic are 
under a critically high degree of stress and burnout; 
Whereas shortages of personal protective equipment, difficult 
working conditions, burdensome administrative tasks, 
long hours, grief over losing patients, and watching the 
families of patients suffer added a layer of extreme stress 
for many frontline workers; 
Whereas mental health and physical health are equally impor-
tant components of overall health; 
Whereas there are structural barriers in place that discourage 
self-care and mental health help-seeking behaviors among 
physicians; and 
Whereas a day of public awareness and education campaigns 
to shine a light on the tragedy of physician suicide is held 
on September 17 each year: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the goals of National Physician

Suicide Awareness Day to bring national attention 
3
to the mental health crisis affecting physicians in 
4
the United States; 
5
(2) dedicates a day of reflection to honor the

memory of physicians who have died by suicide;
