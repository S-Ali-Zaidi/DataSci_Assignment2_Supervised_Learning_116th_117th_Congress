Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

Congress finds the following:

•HR 6206 IH
(1) The H–1B visa has become a program used 
1
to supplant American workers with inexpensive for-
2
eign labor. 
3
(2) 60 percent of H–1B visas are assigned wage 
4
levels substantially below the local median wages for 
5
their relevant occupations. 
6
(3) The ability to hire non-American workers at 
7
wages substantially below median wage levels, ad-
8
justed 
for 
locality 
and 
occupation, 
clearly 
9
disincentivizes the hiring of American workers. 
10
(4) In 2019, Big Tech companies like Amazon, 
11
Google, Microsoft, Facebook, IBM, and Apple were 
12
6 of the top 8 initial approval recipients for H–1B 
13
visas. This trend has existed since 2014. 
14
(5) The Optional Practical Training Program 
15
was created without Congressional Authority, was 
16
expanded by the Obama Administration, and is most 
17
beneficial to Big Tech. 
18
(6) The Optional Practical Training Program 
19
allows student visa holders who have completed their 
20
studies and earned a degree in Science, Technology, 
21
Engineering, or Math (STEM) to work for up to 
22
three years, and waives their employer’s payroll tax 
23
obligations for the OPT participant.

(7) The Optional Practical Training Program 
1
functions as a tax break for employers who do not 
2
employ Americans, and actively incentivizes such.
