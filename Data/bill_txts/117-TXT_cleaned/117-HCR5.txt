CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 
Censuring and condemning President Donald J. Trump for 
trying to unlawfully overturn the 2020 Presidential elec-
tion and violating his oath of office on January 6, 2021. 
Whereas, on January 6, 2021, pursuant to the 12th Amend-
ment of the Constitution of the United States, the Vice 
President of the United States, the House of Representa-
tives, and the Senate met at the United States Capitol 
for a Joint Session of Congress to count the votes of the 
Electoral College; 
Whereas in the months preceding the Joint Session, Presi-
dent Trump repeatedly issued false statements asserting 
that the Presidential election results were the product of

widespread fraud and should not be accepted by the 
American people or certified by State or Federal officials; 
Whereas shortly before the Joint Session commenced, Presi-
dent Trump addressed a crowd at the Ellipse in Wash-
ington, DC; 
Whereas there, he reiterated false claims that ‘‘we won this 
election, and we won it by a landslide’’; 
Whereas he also made statements that, in context, encour-
aged—and foreseeably resulted in—lawless action at the 
Capitol, such as: ‘‘if you don’t fight like hell you’re not 
going to have a country anymore’’; 
Whereas members of the crowd he had addressed, in an at-
tempt to, among other objectives, interfere with the Joint 
Session’s solemn constitutional duty to certify the results 
of the 2020 Presidential election, unlawfully breached 
and vandalized the Capitol, injured and killed law en-
forcement personnel, menaced Members of Congress, the 
Vice President, and Congressional personnel, and en-
gaged in other violent, deadly, destructive, and seditious 
acts; 
Whereas President Trump’s conduct on January 6, 2021, fol-
lowed his prior efforts to subvert and obstruct the certifi-
cation of the results of the 2020 Presidential election; 
Whereas those prior efforts included a phone call on January 
2, 2021, during which President Trump urged the Sec-
retary of State of Georgia, Brad Raffensperger, to ‘‘find’’ 
enough votes to overturn the Georgia Presidential elec-
tion results and threatened Secretary Raffensperger if he 
failed to do so;

Whereas in all of this, President Trump gravely endangered 
the security of the United States and its institutions of 
Government; 
Whereas he threatened the integrity of the democratic sys-
tem, interfered with the peaceful transition of power, and 
imperiled a coequal branch of Government; and 
Whereas he thereby betrayed his trust as President, to the 
manifest injury of the people of the United States: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate 
1
concurring), That Congress—
