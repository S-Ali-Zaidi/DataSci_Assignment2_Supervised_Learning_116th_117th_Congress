RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the harm associated with restraints in schools. 
Whereas there were 70,833 American public school students 
subjected to physical restraint throughout the 2017 to 
2018 school year; 
Whereas the Government Accountability Office’s report on se-
clusions and restraints revealed at least 20 student fatali-
ties linked to incorrect restraint techniques since 2009; 
Whereas trauma resulting from physical restraint can inter-
rupt and impede a child’s brain development throughout 
early childhood;

Whereas elementary school-age children are sometimes too 
small to be restrained using standard handcuffs and are 
forced into unnatural, uncomfortable, and potentially 
dangerous positions, such as being restrained by their bi-
ceps; 
Whereas physical restraints may trigger short-term problems 
in sleep, learning, relationship building, and trust; 
Whereas physical force can create a lasting distrust of adults 
and authority figures and has the potential to breed ag-
gressive tendencies into adulthood; 
Whereas some children who experienced physical restraints at 
an early age in a school setting were hospitalized after 
experiencing suicidal thoughts, while others were hos-
pitalized for their bruises and physical injuries; 
Whereas the Department of Education noted that restraints 
have not been shown to alter behavior; 
Whereas secondary traumatic stress is defined as trauma de-
veloped by individuals who are exposed to the trauma of 
others through their professional roles; 
Whereas law enforcement officers witness trauma daily, 
which increases the likelihood of developing post-trau-
matic stress disorder and other traumatic symptoma-
tology; and 
Whereas educators, administrators, educator support profes-
sionals, school resource officers, and law enforcement of-
ficers may experience secondary trauma as a result of 
witnessing or administering restraints on a child: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
