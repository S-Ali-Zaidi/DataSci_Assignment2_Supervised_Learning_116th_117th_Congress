(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 402 of the Health Care 
4
Quality Improvement Act of 1986 (42 U.S.C. 11101; Pub-
5
lic Law 99–660) is amended by adding at the end the fol-
6
lowing new paragraph: 
7
‘‘(6) Some peer reviewed decisions may be 
8
based on factors other than competence or profes-
9
sional conduct. The stated reason for a professional 
10
review action may not be the actual reason for the 
11
action, and the actual reason may not be apparent 
12
from the face of the action. The need to provide in-
13
centive and protection for physicians engaging in ef-
14
fective professional peer review must be balanced 
15
against the need to protect competent physicians 
16
from peer review decisions that are not based on 
17
professional competence or conduct.’’. 
18
(b) EFFECTIVE DATE.—The amendment made by 
19
subsection (a) shall take effect as if included in the enact-
20
ment of the Health Care Quality Improvement Act of 
21
1986.
