A BILL 
To amend title XXVII of the Public Health Service Act 
to require group health plans and health insurance 
issuers offering group or individual health insurance cov-
erage to provide benefits for lung cancer screenings for 
certain individuals without the imposition of cost sharing. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Katherine’s Lung Can-
4
cer Early Detection and Survival Act of 2021’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 238 IH
(1) Lung cancer is the number 1 killer of all 
1
cancers. 
2
(2) Lung cancer causes more deaths than pros-
3
tate cancer, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer 
4
combined. 
5
(3) The reason for the extremely low 5-year 
6
survival rate in lung cancer patients is the difficulty 
7
to find it at early stages (as patients have no symp-
8
toms at early stages). 
9
(4) For all stages of lung cancer, the overall 5- 
10
year survival rate is 19 percent, while such rate is 
11
98 percent for prostate cancer and 90 percent for 
12
breast cancer (all stages). 
13
(5) Early detection of lung cancer through 
14
screening could dramatically increase survival rates 
15
for patients. 
16
(6) Current law mandates free screening for 
17
breast cancer, prostate cancer, and colorectal cancer 
18
at much earlier ages than for lung cancer, regardless 
19
of preexisting conditions of the individual to be 
20
screened. 
21
(7) Free screening starts at age 40 for breast 
22
cancer but for lung cancer does not start until age 
23
55, and then and only for those with a history of 
24
smoking thirty or more packs of cigarettes per year.
