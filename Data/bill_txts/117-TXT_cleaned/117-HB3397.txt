(2) Dual language immersion engenders an in-
1
clusive learning environment for all students. 
2
(3) Studies have demonstrated that all students 
3
in multilanguage immersion programs have higher 
4
academic achievement as measured by statewide ex-
5
amination, regardless of socioeconomic status. 
6
(4) Dual language immersion has proven to be 
7
one of the most effective and longest lasting inter-
8
vention methods for English learners. 
9

10
participation in dual language immersion programs 
11
is correlated with closing or substantial reduction of 
12
achievement gaps for historically underserved stu-
13
dents. 
14
(6) Few children from low-income families, par-
15
ticularly African-American children, have had access

to a well-developed and well-implemented dual lan-
17
guage program.

19
ence substantial gains in language, literacy, and
