CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of Congress regarding the importance 
of including small business concerns, especially minority- 
owned small business concerns, in any efforts to leverage 
the Defense Production Act in response to the COVID– 
19 pandemic. 
Whereas, on January 21, 2021, the President announced a 
national strategy and signed an Executive order to com-
bat the COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas a cornerstone of the President’s national strategy 
and Executive order includes exercising his authority 
under the Defense Production Act of 1950 (50 U.S.C. 
4501 et seq.) to increase production of critical medical

supplies, including testing supplies, vaccination supplies, 
and personal protective equipment (‘‘PPE’’); 
Whereas small businesses are bearing the brunt of the 
COVID–19 pandemic, as shown by the fact that from 
January 2020 through December 31, 2020, the number 
of open small businesses decreased by 29.7 percent; 
Whereas minority-owned small businesses, in particular, have 
been disproportionately affected by the COVID–19 pan-
demic; 
Whereas a National Bureau of Economic Research study 
found that during the first two months of the pandemic, 
41 percent of small businesses owned by African Ameri-
cans and 32 percent of small businesses owned by His-
panics were forced to close their doors, compared to 22 
percent of small businesses overall; 
Whereas small businesses are resilient and proven innovators, 
and several have pivoted to manufacturing medical sup-
plies, including PPE, in order to fill the gaps and retain 
their workforce; and 
Whereas sections 108 and 701 of the Defense Production Act 
of 1950 (50 U.S.C. 4518; 4551) establish a preference 
for small business concerns, and in particular, section 
701 states that ‘‘Small business concerns shall be given 
the maximum practicable opportunity to participate as 
contractors, and subcontractors at various tiers, in all 
programs to maintain and strengthen the Nation’s indus-
trial base and technology base undertaken pursuant to 
this Act.’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate 
1
concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that the 
2
President should ensure small business concerns, espe-
