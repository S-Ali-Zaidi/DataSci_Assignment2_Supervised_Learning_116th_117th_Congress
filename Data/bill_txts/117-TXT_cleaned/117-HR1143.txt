RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the service of the Los Angeles-class attack sub-
marine, the USS Oklahoma City, and the crew of the 
USS Oklahoma City, who served the United States with 
valor and bravery. 
Whereas the USS Oklahoma City (SSN–723) is a nuclear- 
powered fast attack submarine named after Oklahoma 
City, the capital and most populous city in Oklahoma, 
and is the second ship in the United States Navy’s his-
tory to bear that name; 
Whereas the motto of the USS Oklahoma City is The Sooner, 
The Better, which is a testament to both the spirit of the 
people of Oklahoma City and the readiness of the 140- 
person crew of the USS Oklahoma City;
