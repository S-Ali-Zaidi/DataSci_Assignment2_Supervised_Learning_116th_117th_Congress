act or practice within the meaning of section 5(a)(1) of 
5
the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45(a)(1))

for a person, in connection with the assertion of a United

ing written communications that state or represent that 
9
the recipients are or may be infringing, or have or may 
10
have infringed, the patent and bear liability or owe com-
11
pensation to another, if— 
12
(1) the sender of the communications, in bad 
13
faith, states or represents in the communications 
14
that— 
15

to license or enforce the patent at the time the 
17
communications are sent, and the sender is not 
18
a person with such a right;

close that such license is unrelated to the al-
10
leged infringement or the patent asserted in the 
11
communications; 
12
(H) an investigation of the recipient’s al-
13
leged infringement occurred; or 
14
(I) the sender or an affiliate of the sender 
15
previously filed a civil action asserting a claim

of infringement of the patent based on the ac-
17
tivity that is the subject of the written commu-
18
nication when the sender knew such activity 
19
was held, in a final determination, not to in-
20
fringe the patent;

faith, seeks compensation for—

claim or claims that are the subject of the com-
8
munications, by a person with the right to li-

cense the patent; or

13
right to license the patent to, or enforce the 
14
patent against, the recipient, including the iden-
15
tity of any parent entity and the ultimate par-
16
ent entity of such person, unless such person is 
17
a public company and the name of the public 
18
company is identified;

sertions or claims relating to the patent con-

(b) AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE.—With respect to sub-
11

12
statements, representations, or omissions were not made 
13
in bad faith (as defined in subparagraphs (B) and (C) of 
14
section 5(1)) if the sender can demonstrate that such 
15
statements, representations, or omissions were mistakes 
16
made in good faith, which may be demonstrated by a pre-
17
ponderance of evidence that the violation was not inten-
18
tional and resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding 
19
the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to 
20
avoid any such error.

(c) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.—For purposes of sec-
