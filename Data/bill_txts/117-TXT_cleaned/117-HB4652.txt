•HR 4652 IH
(1) As directed by Congress in section 713 of 
1
the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 613), 
2
as added by section 305 of the Telecommunications 
3
Act of 1996 (Public Law 104–104; 110 Stat. 126), 
4
the Federal Communications Commission began en-
5
forcing rules requiring full closed captioning of most 
6
English television programming on January 1, 2006. 
7
(2) The Federal Communications Commission 
8
rules also require that video programming be fully 
9
captioned in Spanish by 2010. 
10
(3) More than 37,500,000 Americans are con-
11
sidered deaf or hard of hearing, and many require 
12
captioning services to participate in mainstream ac-
13
tivities. 
14
(4) The National Institute on Deafness and 
15
other Communication Disorders estimates that one 
16
in 3 Americans over the age of 60 has already expe-
17
rienced hearing loss. The 79,000,000 Americans who 
18
are identified as ‘‘baby boomers’’ represent 39 per-
19
cent of the population of the United States and most 
20
baby boomers began to reach age 60 just in the last 
21
few years. 
22
(5) Closed captioning is a continuous source of 
23
emergency information for people in mass transit 
24
and other congregate settings.
