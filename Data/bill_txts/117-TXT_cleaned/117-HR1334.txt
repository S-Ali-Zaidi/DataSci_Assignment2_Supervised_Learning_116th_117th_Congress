RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
all 50 States should include the events of the September 
11th terrorist attacks in their the curriculum of elemen-
tary and secondary schools so that the American people 
may never forget that fateful day. 
Whereas the attacks of September 11, 2001, marked the 
deadliest terrorist attack on American soil in United 
States history, claiming 2,997 lives in the span of only 
a few short hours, and countless others due to injury and 
illness in the following decades; 
Whereas on the morning of September 11, 2001, firefighters, 
emergency medical personnel, and police officers serving 
in the five boroughs bravely rushed into the World Trade 
Center to rescue the thousands of civilians who had be-

come injured and trapped, and at the same time, first re-
sponders in Washington, DC, Arlington, Virginia, and 
Shanksville, Pennsylvania, rushed to the aid of military 
personnel and civilians who had been victimized as part 
of a coordinated effort to cripple the United States econ-
omy and defense network; 
Whereas despite mounting losses, the first responders in New 
York, Washington, DC, Virginia, and Pennsylvania car-
ried out the greatest rescue operation in American his-
tory, saving thousands that would have otherwise per-
ished; 
Whereas the events of September 11, 2001, signaled a shift 
in the United States national security posture, demand-
ing an unwavering commitment to vigilance, proactivity, 
and caution that persists to the present day, and forever 
changing how we approach defending the homeland from 
threats foreign and domestic; 
Whereas the first generation of Americans born following 
September 11, 2001, are reaching adulthood, yet only 14 
States require America’s youth be educated on the events 
of this fateful day; 
Whereas all students across the country should be provided 
education about the events of September 11, 2001; 
Whereas failing to educate the next generation of Americans 
about the events of September 11, 2001, would be a dis-
service to the memories of the 2,997 innocent individuals 
who were murdered on that day, as well as the thousands 
of first responders and survivors who have been diag-
nosed with, or have died as a result of 9/11-related can-
cers and other illnesses in the 21 years since the attacks;

Whereas it is imperative to educate the next generation of 
Americans about the events of September 11, 2001, so as 
to prepare future leaders, Members of Congress, 
servicemembers, homeland security professionals, and ev-
eryday Americans with valuable insights and context crit-
ical to preventing future attacks on the United States; 
and 
Whereas in memory of all those who perished during these 
attacks and those who continue to perish because of their 
efforts on this day, we must uphold our commitment to 
honoring their sacrifice by ensuring that this funda-
mental part of the American story not be lost to future 
generations: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-

resentatives that all 50 States should include the events

of the September 11th terrorist attacks in the curriculum 
3
of elementary and secondary schools so that the American

people may never forget that fateful day.
