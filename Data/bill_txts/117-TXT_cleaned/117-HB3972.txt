1
(a) Congress makes the following findings: 
2
(1) The United States has consistently sought 
3
to advance peace and stability in East Asia as a cen-
4
tral element of U.S. foreign policy toward the region. 
5
(2) Peace and stability in East Asia has pro-
6
vided the necessary environment for the tremendous 
7
economic growth experienced by the region and re-
8
mains critical to the continued development and 
9
prosperity of all people in the Indo-Pacific. 
10
(3) The Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 (Public 
11
Law 96–8; 22 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.) and the ‘‘Six As-
12
surances’’, provided by the United States to Taiwan 
13
in July 1982, are the cornerstones of U.S.-Taiwan

relations and continue to guide U.S. policy toward 
1
Taiwan. 
2
(4) The Taiwan Relations Act states that it is 
3
the policy of the United States to— 
4
‘‘(A) preserve and promote extensive, close, 
5
and friendly commercial, cultural, and other re-
6
lations between the people of the United States 
7
and the people on Taiwan, as well as the people 
8
on the China mainland and all other peoples of 
9
the Western Pacific area; 
10
‘‘(B) declare that peace and stability in the 
11
area are in the political, security, and economic 
12
interests of the United States, and are matters 
13
of international concern; 
14
‘‘(C) make clear that the United States de-
15
cision to establish diplomatic relations with the 
16
People’s Republic of China rests upon the ex-
17
pectation that the future of Taiwan will be de-
18
termined by peaceful means; 
19
‘‘(D) consider any effort to determine the 
20
future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means, 
21
including by boycotts or embargoes, a threat to 
22
the peace and security of the Western Pacific 
23
area and of grave concern to the United States;

‘‘(E) provide Taiwan with arms of a defen-

‘‘(F) maintain the capacity of the United 
3
States to resist any resort to force or other 
4
forms of coercion that would jeopardize the se-
5
curity, or the social or economic system, of the 
6
people on Taiwan.’’. 
7
(5) The Government of the People’s Republic of 
8
China (PRC), especially since the election of Tsai 
9
Ing-Wen in 2016, has conducted a coordinated cam-
10
paign to weaken Taiwan diplomatically, economi-
11
cally, and militarily in a manner that threatens to 
12
erode U.S. policy and create a fait accompli on ques-
13
tions surrounding Taiwan’s future. 
14
(6) In order to ensure the longevity of U.S. pol-
15
icy and preserve the ability of the people of Taiwan 
16
to determine their future independently, it is nec-
17
essary to reinforce Taiwan’s diplomatic, economic, 
18
and physical space. 
19
(b) It is the policy of the United States to— 
20
(1) maintain the position that peace and sta-
21
bility in the Western Pacific are in the political, se-
22
curity, and economic interests of the United States, 
23
and are matters of international concern; and

MEANINGFUL 
PARTICIPA-

TION IN THE INTERNATIONAL

8
SEC. 101. FINDINGS. 
9
Congress makes the following findings: 
10
(1) Taiwan has provided monetary, humani-
11
tarian, and medical assistance to combat diseases 
12
such as AIDS, tuberculosis, Ebola, and dengue fever 
13
in countries around the world. During the COVID– 
14
19 pandemic, Taiwan donated millions of pieces of 
15
personal protective equipment and COVID–19 tests 
16
to countries in need. 
17
(2) Since 2016, the Gambia, Sao Tome and 
18
Principe, Panama, the Dominican Republic, Burkina 
19
Faso, El Salvador, the Solomon Islands, and 
20
Kiribati have severed diplomatic relations with Tai-
21
wan in favor of diplomatic relations with China. 
22
(3) Taiwan was invited to participate in the 
23
World Health Assembly, the decision-making body of 
24
the World Health Organization (WHO), as an ob-
25

server annually between 2009 and 2016. Since the 
1
2016 election of President Tsai, the PRC has in-
2
creasingly resisted Taiwan’s participation in the 
3
WHA. Taiwan was not invited to attend the WHA 
4
in 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, or 2021. 
5
(4) The Taipei Flight Information Region re-
6
portedly served 1.75 million flights and 68.9 million 
7
passengers in 2018 and is home to Taiwan Taoyuan 
8
International airport, the eleventh busiest airport in 
9
the world. Taiwan has been excluded from partici-
10
pating at the International Civil Aviation Organiza-
11
tion (ICAO) since 2013. 
12
(5) United Nations (UN) General Assembly 
13
Resolution 2758 does not address the issue of rep-
14
resentation of Taiwan and its people at the United 
15
Nations, nor does it give the PRC the right to rep-
16
resent the people of Taiwan.

SEC. 102. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON TAIWAN’S MEANINGFUL 
18
PARTICIPATION 
IN 
THE 
INTERNATIONAL 
19
COMMUNITY. 
20
It is the sense of Congress that— 
21
(1) Taiwan is free, democratic, and prosperous, 
22
and is home to 23.5 million people. It is an impor-
23
tant contributor to the global community, as a model 
24
for democracy, and by providing expertise in global

health, international aviation security, emerging 
1
technology development, and with forward looking 
2
environmental policies; 
3
(2) multiple United States Government admin-
4
istrations of both political parties have taken impor-
5
tant steps to advance Taiwan’s meaningful partici-
6
pation in international organizations; 
7
(3) existing efforts to enhance U.S. cooperation 
8
with Taiwan to provide global public goods, includ-
9
ing through development assistance, humanitarian 
10
assistance, and disaster relief in trilateral and multi-
11
lateral fora is laudable and should continue; 
12
(4) nonetheless, significant structural, policy, 
13
and legal barriers remain to advancing Taiwan’s 
14
meaningful participation in the international com-
15
munity; and 
16
(5) efforts to share Taiwan’s expertise with 
17
other parts of the global community could be further 
18
enhanced through a systematic approach, along with 
19
greater attention from Congress and the American 
20
public to such efforts.
