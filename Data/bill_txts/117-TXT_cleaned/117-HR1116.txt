RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the annual Childhood Apraxia of 
Speech Awareness Day on May 14, 2022, coinciding 
with Better Hearing and Speech Month. 
Whereas childhood apraxia of speech is a motor speech neu-
rological condition affecting 1 to 2 out of 1,000 children 
in the United States; 
Whereas children diagnosed with childhood apraxia of speech 
generally have a good sense of the language and know 
what they want to say, however, they have difficulty 
learning and carrying out the complex and sequenced 
movements that are necessary for intelligible speech; 
Whereas childhood apraxia of speech is often misdiagnosed or 
undiagnosed, leading to a greater gap for children who 
require intensive speech therapy;
