SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) GENERAL FINDINGS.— 
3
(A) 
Consumer 
reporting 
agencies 
4
(‘‘CRAs’’) are companies that collect, compile, 
5
and provide information about consumers in the 
6
form of consumer reports for certain permis-
7
sible statutory purposes under the Fair Credit 
8
Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.) 
9
(‘‘FCRA’’). The three largest CRAs in this 
10
country 
are 
Equifax, 
TransUnion, 
and 
11
Experian. These CRAs are referred to as na-
12
tionwide CRAs and the reports that they pre-
13
pare are commonly referred to as credit reports. 
14
Furnishers, such as creditors, lenders, and debt 
15
collection agencies, voluntarily submit informa-
16
tion to CRAs about their accounts such as the 
17
total amount for each loan or credit limit for 
18
each credit card and the consumer’s payment 
19
history on these products. Reports also include 
20
identifying information about a consumer, such 
21
as their birthdate, previous mailing addresses, 
22
and current and previous employers. 
23
(B) In a December 2012 paper, ‘‘Key Di-
24
mensions and Processes in the U.S. Credit Re-
25
porting System: A review for how the nation’s 
26

•HR 4115 IH
largest credit bureaus manage consumer data’’, 
1
the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection 
2
(‘‘Consumer Bureau’’) noted that the three na-
3
tionwide CRAs maintain credit files on approxi-
4
mately 200 million adults and receive informa-
5
tion from about 10,000 furnishers. On a 
6
monthly basis, these furnishers provide infor-
7
mation on over 1.3 billion consumer credit ac-
8
counts or other trade lines. 
9
(C) The 10 largest institutions furnishing 
10
credit information to each of the nationwide 
11
CRAs account for more than half of all ac-
12
counts reflected in consumers’ credit files. 
13
(D) Consumer reports play an increasingly 
14
important role in the lives of American con-
15
sumers. Most creditors, for example, review 
16
these reports to make decisions about whether 
17
to extend credit to consumers and what terms 
18
and conditions to offer them. As such, informa-
19
tion contained in these reports affects whether 
20
a person is able to get a private education loan 
21
to pay for college costs, to secure a mortgage 
22
loan to buy a home, or to obtain a credit card, 
23
as well as the terms and conditions under which 
24
21:57 Jul 26, 2021
H4115
5 
•HR 4115 IH
consumer credit products or services are offered 
1
to them. 
2
(E) Credit reports are also increasingly 
3
used for many noncredit decisions, including by 
4
landlords to determine whether to rent an 
5
apartment to a prospective tenant and by em-
6
ployers to decide whether to hire potential job 
7
applicants or to offer a promotion to existing 
8
employees. 
9
(F) CRAs have a statutory obligation to 
10
verify independently the accuracy and complete-
11
ness of information included on the reports that 
12
they provide. 
13
(G) The nationwide CRAs have failed to 
14
establish and follow reasonable procedures, as 
15
required by existing law, to establish the max-
16
imum level of accuracy of information contained 
17
on consumer reports. Given the repeated fail-
18
ures of these CRAs to comply with accuracy re-
19
quirements on their own, legislation is intended 
20
to provide them with detailed guidance improv-
21
ing the accuracy and completeness of informa-
22
tion contained in consumer reports, including 
23
procedures, policies, and practices that these 
24
21:57 Jul 26, 2021
H4115
6 
•HR 4115 IH
CRAs should already be following to ensure full 
1
compliance with their existing obligations. 
2
(H) The presence of inaccurate or incom-
3
plete information on these reports can result in 
4
substantial financial and emotional harm to 
5
consumers. Credit reporting errors can lead to 
6
the loss of a new employment opportunity or a 
7
denial of a promotion in an existing job, stop 
8
someone from being able to access credit on fa-
9
vorable terms, prevent a person from obtaining 
10
rental housing, or even trigger mental distress. 
11
(I) Current industry practices impose an 
12
unfair burden of proof on consumers trying to 
13
fix errors on their reports. 
14
(J) Consumer reports containing inac-
15
curate or incomplete credit information also un-
16
dermine the ability of creditors and lenders to 
17
effectively and accurately underwrite and price 
18
credit. 
19
(K) Recognizing that credit reporting af-
20
fects the lives of almost all consumers in this 
21
country and that the consequences of errors on 
22
a consumer report can be catastrophic for a 
23
consumer, the Consumer Bureau began accept-
24
21:57 Jul 26, 2021
H4115
7 
•HR 4115 IH
ing consumer complaints about credit reporting 
1
in October 2012. 
2
(L) As of February 2017, the Consumer 
3
Bureau has handled approximately 185,717 
4
credit reporting complaints, making credit re-
5
porting consistently the third most-complained- 
6
about subject matter on which the Consumer 
7
Bureau accepts consumer complaints. 
8
(M) In the ‘‘Monthly Complaint Report 
9
Volume 20’’, released in February 2017, the 
10
Consumer Bureau noted that 76 percent of 
11
credit reporting complaints involved incorrect 
12
information on reports, with consumers fre-
13
quently expressing their frustrations about the 
14
burdensome and time-consuming process to dis-
15
puting items. 
16
(N) Other common types of credit report-
17
ing complaints submitted to the Consumer Bu-
18
reau related to the improper use of a report, 
19
trouble obtaining a report or credit score, 
20
CRAs’ investigations, and credit monitoring or 
21
identity protection. 
22
(O) In the summer 2015 ‘‘Supervisory 
23
Highlights’’, the Consumer Bureau noted that 
24
one or more of the largest CRAs failed to ade-
25
21:57 Jul 26, 2021
H4115

•HR 4115 IH
quately oversee furnishers to ensure that they 
1
were adhering to the CRA’s vetting policies and 
2
to establish proper procedures to verify public 
3
record information. 
4
(P) According to the fall 2016 ‘‘Super-
5
visory Highlights’’, Consumer Bureau exam-
6
iners determined that one or more debt collec-
7
tors never investigated indirect disputes that 
8
lacked detail or were not accompanied by at-
9
tachments with relevant information from the 
10
consumer. Examiners also found that notifica-
11
tions sent to consumers about disputes consid-
12
ered frivolous failed to identify for the con-
13
sumers the type of material that they could pro-
14
vide in order for the debt collector to complete 
15
the investigation of the disputed item. 
16
(Q) A February 2014 Consumer Bureau 
17
report titled ‘‘Credit Reporting Complaint 
18
Snapshot’’ found that consumers are confused 
19
about the extent to which the nationwide CRAs 
20
are required to provide them with validation 
21
and documentation of a debt that appears on 
22
their credit report. 
23
(R) As evidence that the current system 
24
lacks sufficient market incentives for CRAs to 
25
21:57 Jul 26, 2021
H4115
9 
•HR 4115 IH
develop more robust procedures to increase the 
1
accuracy and completeness of information on 
2
credit reports, litigation discovery documented 
3
by 
the 
National 
Consumer 
Law 
Center 
4
(‘‘NCLC’’), as part of a January 2009 report 
5
titled, ‘‘Automated Injustice: How a Mecha-
6
nized Dispute System Frustrates Consumers 
7
Seeking to Fix Errors in Their Credit Re-
8
ports’’, showed that at least two of the three 
9
largest CRAs use quota systems to force em-
10
ployees to process disputes hastily and without 
11
the opportunity for conducting meaningful in-
12
vestigations. At least one nationwide CRA only 
13
allowed dispute resolution staff five minutes to 
14
handle a consumer’s call. Furthermore, these 
15
CRAs were found to have awarded bonuses for 
16
meeting quotas and punished those who didn’t 
17
meet production numbers with probation. 
18
(S) Unlike most other business relation-
19
ships, where consumers can register their satis-
20
faction or unhappiness with a particular credit 
21
product or service simply by taking their busi-
22
ness elsewhere, consumers have no say in 
23
whether their information is included in the 
24
CRAs databases and limited legal remedies to 
25
21:57 Jul 26, 2021
H4115
10 
•HR 4115 IH
hold the CRAs accountable for inaccuracies or 
1
poor service. 
2
(T) Accordingly, despite the existing statu-
3
tory mandate for CRAs to follow reasonable 
4
procedures to assure the maximum possible ac-
5
curacy of the information whenever they pre-
6
pare consumer reports, numerous studies, the 
7
high volume of consumer complaints submitted 
8
to the Consumer Bureau about incorrect infor-
9
mation on consumer reports, and supervisory 
10
activities by the Consumer Bureau demonstrate 
11
that CRAs continue to skirt their obligations 
12
under the law. 
13
(2) PRIVATE EDUCATION LOANS.— 
14
(A) The Consumer Bureau’s October 2014 
15
report titled ‘‘Annual Report of the CFPB Stu-
16
dent Loan Ombudsman’’ noted many private 
17
education loan borrowers, who sought to nego-
18
tiate a modified repayment plan when they were 
19
experiencing a period of financial distress, were 
20
unable to get assistance from their loan holders, 
21
which often resulting in them defaulting on 
22
their loans. This pattern resembles the dif-
23
ficulty that a significant number of mortgage 
24
loan borrowers experienced when they sought to 
25
21:57 Jul 26, 2021
H4115
11 
•HR 4115 IH
take responsible steps to work with their mort-
1
gage loan servicer to avoid foreclosure during 
2
the Great Recession. 
3
(B) Although private student loan holders 
4
may allow a borrower to postpone payments 
5
while enrolled in school full-time, many limit 
6
this option to a certain time period, usually 48 
7
to 66 months. This limited time period may not 
8
be sufficient for those who need additional time 
9
to obtain their degree or who want to continue 
10
their education by pursing a graduate or profes-
11
sional degree. The Consumer Bureau found 
12
that borrowers who were unable to make pay-
13
ments often defaulted or had their accounts 
14
sent to collections before they were even able to 
15
graduate. 
16
(3) DECEPTIVE PRACTICES AT CERTAIN PRO-
17
PRIETARY EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS AND CAREER 
18
EDUCATION PROGRAMS.— 
19
(A) NCLC cited the proliferation of law 
20
enforcement actions against many for-profit 
21
schools in its June 2014 report, titled ‘‘Ensur-
22
ing Educational Integrity: 10 Steps to Improve 
23
State Oversight of For-profit Schools’’, to dem-
24
onstrate the pervasive problem in this sector of 
25
21:57 Jul 26, 2021
H4115
12 
•HR 4115 IH
targeting low-income students with deceptive 
1
high-pressure sales techniques involving inflated 
2
job placement rates and misleading data on 
3
graduate wages, and false representations about 
4
the transferability of credits and the employ-
5
ability of graduates in occupations that require 
6
licensure. Student loan borrowers at these 
7
schools may be left with nothing but worthless 
8
credentials and large debt. Those who default 
9
on their student loans face years with damaged 
10
credit that will adversely impact their ability to 
11
rent or buy homes, purchase cars, and find em-
12
ployment. 
13
(B) The closure and bankruptcy of Corin-
14
thian Colleges, which was found to have de-
15
ceived students by steering them into high-in-
16
terest student loans based on misleading grad-
17
uation rates and employment data, is a good 
18
example of the problem. Even after its closure, 
19
many Corinthian students remained saddled 
20
with student loan debt, worthless degrees, and 
21
few prospects for employment. 
22
(C) Attending a two-year, for-profit college 
23
costs, on average, four times as much as at-
24
tending a community college. Students at for- 
25
21:57 Jul 26, 2021
H4115
13 
•HR 4115 IH
profit colleges represent only about 11 percent 
1
of the total higher education population but a 
2
startling 44 percent of all Federal student loan 
3
defaults, according to the United States De-
4
partment of Education (‘‘DOE’’). 
5
(D) According to NCLC, a dispropor-
6
tionate number of for-profit students are low-in-
7
come and people of color. These schools target 
8
veterans, working parents, first-generation stu-
9
dents, and non-English speaking students, who 
10
may be more likely than their public or private 
11
nonprofit school counterparts to drop out, incur 
12
enormous student debt, and default on this 
13
debt. In the 2011–2012 school year, 28 percent 
14
of African Americans and 15 percent of Latinos 
15
attending four-year institutions were enrolled in 
16
a for-profit school, compared to 10 percent of 
17
Whites. 
18
(E) As highlighted in a press release titled 
19
‘‘Obama Administration Announces Final Rules 
20
to Protect Students from Poor-Performing Ca-
21
reer College Programs’’, that was issued by the 
22
DOE on October 30, 2014, ‘‘øt¿oo often, stu-
23
dents at career colleges—including thousands of 
24
veterans—are charged excessive costs, but don’t

get the education they paid for. Instead, stu-
1
dents in such programs are provided with poor 
2
quality training, often for low-wage jobs or in 
3
occupations where there are simply no job op-
4
portunities. They find themselves with large 
5
amounts of debt and, too often, end up in de-
6
fault. In many cases, students are drawn into 
7
these programs with confusing or misleading in-
8
formation.’’. 
9
(4) MEDICAL DEBT.— 
10
(A) Research by the Consumer Bureau has 
11
found that the inclusion of medical collections 
12
on consumer reports has unfairly reduced con-
13
sumers’ credit scores. 
14
(B) The Consumer Bureau’s review of 5 
15
million anonymized credit files from September 
16
2011 to September 2013, for example, found 
17
that credit scores may underestimate a person’s 
18
creditworthiness by up to 10 points for those 
19
who owe medical debt, and may underestimate 
20
a person’s creditworthiness by up to 22 points 
21
after the medical debt has been paid. For con-
22
sumers with lower credit scores, especially those 
23
on the brink of what is considered subprime, a 
24
10 to 22 point decrease in their credit scores 
25
21:57 Jul 26, 2021
H4115
15 
•HR 4115 IH
can have a significant impact on their lives, in-
1
cluding by affecting whether they are able to 
2
qualify for credit and, if so, the terms and con-
3
ditions under which it is extended to them. 
4
(C) The Consumer Bureau found that half 
5
of all collections trade lines that appear on con-
6
sumer reports are related to medical bills 
7
claimed to be owed to hospitals and other med-
8
ical providers. These trade lines affect the re-
9
ports of nearly 1/5 of all consumers in the cred-
10
it reporting system. 
11
(D) The Consumer Bureau has found that 
12
there are no objective or enforceable standards 
13
that determine when a debt can or should be 
14
reported as a collection trade line. Because debt 
15
buyers and collectors determine whether, when, 
16
and for how long to report a collection account, 
17
there is only a limited relationship between the 
18
time period reported, the severity of a delin-
19
quency, and when or whether a collection trade 
20
line appears on a consumer’s credit report. 
21
(E) Medical bills can be complex and con-
22
fusing for many consumers, which results in 
23
consumers’ uncertainty about what they owe, to 
24
whom, when, or for what, that may cause some 
25
21:57 Jul 26, 2021
H4115
16 
•HR 4115 IH
people, who ordinarily pay their bills on time, to 
1
delay or withhold payments on their medical 
2
debts. This uncertainty can also result in med-
3
ical collections appearing on consumer reports. 
4
In a December 2014 report titled ‘‘Consumer 
5
Credit Reports: A Study of Medical and Non- 
6
Medical Collections’’, the Consumer Bureau 
7
found that a large portion of consumers with 
8
medical collections show no other evidence of fi-
9
nancial distress and are consumers who ordi-
10
narily pay their other financial obligations on 
11
time. Unlike with most credit products or serv-
12
ices, such as credit cards, installment loans, 
13
utilities, or wireless or cable services that have 
14
contractual account disclosures describing the 
15
terms and conditions of use, most consumers 
16
are not told what their out-of-pocket medical 
17
costs will be in advance. Consumers needing ur-
18
gent or emergency care rarely know, or are pro-
19
vided, the cost of a medical treatment or proce-
20
dure before the service is rendered. 
21
(F) The Consumer Bureau concluded that 
22
the presence of medical collections is less pre-
23
dictive of future defaults or serious delin-
24
quencies than the presence of a nonmedical col-
25
21:57 Jul 26, 2021
H4115

•HR 4115 IH
lection in a study titled ‘‘Data Point: Medical 
1
Debt and Credit Scores’’, issued in May 2014. 
2
(G) FICO’s latest credit scoring model, 
3
‘‘FICO 9’’, changes the treatment of paid col-
4
lections to disregard any collection matters that 
5
the consumer has paid in full. FICO 9, how-
6
ever, is not yet widely used by lenders. 
7
(H) VantageScore’s latest credit scoring 
8
model, ‘‘VantageScore 4.0’’, will be available in 
9
the fall of 2017. This model will penalize med-
10
ical collections less than non-medical ones. 
11
(I) The three nationwide CRAs entered 
12
into a settlement agreement with the New York 
13
State attorney general in 2015 to address defi-
14
ciencies in their dispute resolution process and 
15
enhance the accuracy of items on reports. These 
16
policy changes will be implemented in a three- 
17
phrased rollout, culminating by June 2018. 
18
Subsequently, these CRAs entered into a coop-
19
erative agreement with 31 State Attorneys Gen-
20
eral, which was the basis of the creation of the 
21
National Consumer Assistance Plan (‘‘NCAP’’) 
22
to change some of their business practices. 
23
(J) While the CRAs appear to be volun-
24
tarily adopting policy changes on a nationwide 
25
21:57 Jul 26, 2021
H4115
18 
•HR 4115 IH
basis, they are not obligated to do so for con-
1
sumers who reside in States that are not party 
2
to any of the consent orders. 
3
(K) As a result of the settlement agree-
4
ments, the three nationwide CRAs will set a 
5
180-day waiting period before including medical 
6
collections on a report and will remove a med-
7
ical collection from a report once it is paid by 
8
an insurance company. While this change will 
9
benefit many, once a medical collection appears 
10
on a report, it will only be deleted or suppressed 
11
if it is found to have been the insurance com-
12
pany’s obligation to pay and the insurer pays it. 
13
Given the research showing there is little pre-
14
dictive value in medical debt information, med-
15
ical collections that are paid or settled should 
16
quickly be removed from a report, regardless of 
17
who pays or settles this debt. 
18
(5) FINANCIAL ABUSE BY KNOWN PERSONS.— 
19
(A) Financial abuse and exploitation are 
20
frequently associated with domestic violence. 
21
This type of abuse may result in fraudulent 
22
charges to a credit card or having fraudulent 
23
accounts created by the abuser in the survivor’s 
24
name. Financial abuse may also result in the

their valid obligations due to loss or changes in 
2
income that can occur when their abuser steals 
3
from or coerces the survivor to relinquish their 
4
paychecks or savings. 
5
(B) By racking up substantial debts in the 
6
survivor’s name, abusers are able to exercise fi-
7
nancial control over their survivors to make it 
8
economically difficult for the survivor, whose 
9
credit is often destroyed, to escape the situa-
10
tion. 
11
(C) Domestic abuse survivors with poor 
12
credit are likely to face significant obstacles in 
13
establishing financial independence from their 
14
abusers. This can be due, in part, because con-
15
sumer reports may be used when a person at-
16
tempts to obtain a checking account, housing, 
17
insurance, utilities, employment, and even a se-
18
curity clearance as required for certain jobs. 
19
(D) Providing documentation of identity 
20
(‘‘ID’’) theft in order to dispute information on

lenging for those who know their financial

(E) While it is easier for consumers who 
1
obtain a police report to remove fraudulent in-
2
formation from their consumer report and pre-
3
vent it from reappearing in the future, accord-
4
ing to the Empire Justice Center, safety and 
5
other noncredit concerns may impact the capac-
6
ity of a survivor of financial abuse committed 
7
by a known person to turn to law enforcement 
8
to get a police report. 
9
(F) According to the Legal Aid Society in 
10
New York, domestic abuse survivors, seeking to 
11
remove adverse information stemming from fi-
12
nancial abuse by contacting their furnishers di-
13
rectly, are likely to face skepticism about claims 
14
of ID theft perpetrated by a partner because of 
15
an assumption that they are aware of, and may 
16
have been complicit in, the activity which the 
17
survivor alleges stems from financial abuse.

(6) DECEPTIVE AND MISLEADING MARKETING 
19
PRACTICES.— 
20
(A) The Consumer Bureau’s February 
21
2015 report titled ‘‘Consumer Voices on Credit 
22
Reports and Scores’’ found that some con-
23
sumers did not obtain a copy of their consumer 
24
report due to concerns about security or of

•HR 4115 IH
being trapped into purchasing unwanted prod-
1
ucts like an additional report or a credit moni-
2
toring service. 
3
(B) In January 2017, the Consumer Bu-
4
reau fined TransUnion and Equifax for decep-
5
tively marketing credit scores for purchase by 
6
consumers as the same credit scores typically 
7
used by lenders to determine creditworthiness 
8
and for luring consumers into costly subscrip-
9
tion services that were advertised as ‘‘free’’ or 
10
‘‘$1’’ that automatically charged recurring fees 
11
unless cancelled by consumers. The Consumer 
12
Bureau also found that Equifax was illegally 
13
advertising its products on webpages that con-
14
sumers 
accessed 
through 
15
AnnualCreditReport.com before consumers ob-
16
tained their free disclosures. Because of these 
17
troubling practices, TransUnion was ordered to 
18
pay $13.9 million in restitution to harmed con-
19
sumers and a civil penalty of $3 million to the 
20
Consumer Bureau. Equifax was ordered to pay 
21
more than $3.7 million to affected consumers 
22
as well as a civil money penalty of $2.5 million 
23
to the Consumer Bureau. As part of the con-
24
sent orders, the CRAs are also supposed to 
25
21:57 Jul 26, 2021
H4115
22 
•HR 4115 IH
change the way that they sell their products to 
1
consumers. The CRAs must also obtain con-
2
sumers’ express consent before enrolling them 
3
into subscription services as well as make it 
4
easer for consumers to cancel these programs. 
5
(C) The Consumer Bureau fined the other 
6
nationwide CRA—Experian—in March 2017 
7
for deceiving consumers about the use of credit 
8
scores that it marketed and sold to consumers 
9
as credit scores that were used by lenders and 
10
for illegally advertising its products on web 
11
pages 
that 
consumers 
accessed 
through 
12
AnnualCreditReport.com before they obtained 
13
their free annual disclosures. Experian was or-
14
dered to pay more than $3.7 million in restitu-
15
tion to harmed consumers and a civil monetary 
16
penalty of $2.5 million to the Consumer Bu-
17
reau. 
18
(D) The Consumer Bureau’s January and 
19
March 2017 consent orders with the three na-
20
tionwide CRAs show that these CRAs have en-
21
ticed consumers into purchasing products and 
22
services that they may not want or need, in 
23
some instances by advertising products or serv-
24
ices ‘‘free’’ that automatically converted into an 
25
21:57 Jul 26, 2021
H4115
23 
•HR 4115 IH
ongoing subscription service at the regular price 
1
unless cancelled by the consumer. Although 
2
these CRAs must now change their deceptive 
3
marketing practices, codifying these duties is an 
4
appropriate way to ensure that these companies 
5
never revert back to such misleading tactics. 
6
(E) Given the ubiquitous use of consumer 
7
reports in consumers’ lives and the fact that 
8
consumers’ participation in the credit reporting 
9
system is involuntary, CRAs should also 
10
prioritize providing consumers with the effective 
11
means to safeguard their personal and financial 
12
information and improve their credit standing, 
13
rather than seeking to exploit consumers’ con-
14
cerns and confusion about credit reporting and 
15
scoring, to boost their companies’ profits. 
16
(F) Vulnerable consumers, who have legiti-
17
mate concerns about the security of their per-
18
sonal and financial information, deserve clear, 
19
accurate, and transparent information about 
20
the credit reporting tools that may be available 
21
to them, such as fraud alerts and freezes.

(7) PROTECTIONS FOR CONSUMERS’ CREDIT IN-
23
FORMATION.— 
24
21:57 Jul 26, 2021
H4115
24 
•HR 4115 IH
(A) Despite heightened awareness, inci-
1
dents of ID theft continue to rise. In February 
2
2015, the FTC reported that ID theft was the 
3
top consumer complaint that it received for the 
4
15th consecutive year. As these incidents in-
5
crease, consumers experience significant finan-
6
cial loss and emotional distress from the inabil-
7
ity to safeguard effectively and inexpensively 
8
their credit information from bad actors. 
9
(B) According to a Carnegie Mellon study, 
10
children are 50 times more likely than adults to 
11
have their identities stolen. Child identities are 
12
valuable to thieves because most children do not 
13
have existing files, and their parents may not 
14
notice fraudulent activity until their child ap-
15
plies for a student loan, a job, or a credit card. 
16
As a result, the fraudulent activity of the bad 
17
actors may go undetected for years. 
18
(C) Despite the increasing incidents of 
19
children’s ID theft, parents who want to 
20
proactively prevent their children from having 
21
their identity stolen, may not be able to do so. 
22
Only one of the three nationwide CRAs cur-
23
rently allows parents from any State to set up 
24
a freeze for a minor child. At the other two na-
25
21:57 Jul 26, 2021
H4115
25 
•HR 4115 IH
tionwide CRAs, parents can only obtain a freeze 
1
after a child has become an ID theft victim be-
2
cause, it is only at this point, that these CRAs 
3
have an existing credit file for the child. While 
4
many States have enacted laws to address this 
5
problem, there is no existing Federal law. 
6
(D) According to Javelin Strategy & 
7
Research’s 2015 Identity Fraud study, $16 bil-
8
lion was stolen by fraudsters from 12.7 million 
9
American consumers in 2014. Similarly, the 
10
United States Department of Justice found an 
11
estimated 7 percent of all residents age 16 or 
12
older (about 17.6 million persons) in this coun-
13
try were victims of one or more incidents of ID 
14
theft in 2014, and the number of elderly victims 
15
age 65 or older (about 86 percent) increased 
16
from 2.1 million in 2012 to 2.6 million in 2014. 
17
(E) Consumers frequently express concern 
18
about the security of their financial informa-
19
tion. According to a 2015 MasterCard survey, 
20
a majority of consumers (77 percent) have anx-
21
iety about the possibility that their financial in-
22
formation and Social Security numbers may be 
23
stolen or compromised, with about 55 percent 
24
of consumers indicating that they would rather 
25
21:57 Jul 26, 2021
H4115
26 
•HR 4115 IH
have naked pictures of themselves leaked online 
1
than have their financial information stolen. 
2
(F) That survey also revealed that con-
3
sumers’ fears about the online security of their 
4
financial information even outweighed con-
5
sumers’ worries about other physical security 
6
dangers such as having their houses robbed (59 
7
percent) or being pickpocketed (46 percent). 
8
(G) According to Consumer Reports, 
9
roughly 50 million American consumers spent 
10
about $3.5 billion in 2010 to purchase products 
11
aimed at protecting their identity, with the an-
12
nual cost of these services ranging from $120 
13
to $300. As risks to consumers’ personal and fi-
14
nancial information continue to grow, con-
15
sumers need additional protections to ensure 
16
that they have fair and reasonable access to the 
17
full suite of ID theft and fraud prevention 
18
measures that may be right for them.
