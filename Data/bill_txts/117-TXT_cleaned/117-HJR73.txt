JOINT RESOLUTION 
Formally apologizing for the nuclear legacy of the United 
States in the Republic of the Marshall Islands and af-
firming the importance of free association between the 
Government of the United States and the Government 
of the Marshall Islands. 
Whereas the United States freed the islands now known as 
the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Republic of 
Palau, and the Federated States of Micronesia from 
Japan through bloody battles during World War II; 
Whereas the United States persuaded the United Nations to 
designate those islands as United Nations Trust Terri-

tory and the United States as Administering Authority of 
those islands pending the development of self-government 
on such islands; 
Whereas, in response to United Nations Security Council con-
cerns with respect to such administration, President 
Harry S. Truman wrote that the people of the Marshall 
Islands ‘‘will be accorded all rights which are the normal 
constitutional rights of the citizens under the Constitu-
tion’’ and ‘‘will be dealt with as wards of the United 
States for whom this country has special responsibil-
ities’’; 
Whereas the United States used the northern atolls of the 
Marshall Islands— 
(1) to conduct extensive nuclear weapons testing 
during the Cold War; and 
(2) to dispose of radioactive waste from the Nevada 
Test Site; 
Whereas the nuclear weapons testing program of the United 
States contaminated at least 11 of the 29 atolls of the 
Marshall Islands; 
Whereas March 1 is Nuclear Victims Remembrance Day in 
the Marshall Islands, which memorializes the 67 thermo-
nuclear tests the United States conducted in the Marshall 
Islands between 1946 and 1958 and which produced on 
average approximately 1.7 times the explosive yield of the 
bomb that destroyed Hiroshima every day for 12 years; 
Whereas the Castle Bravo test on March 1, 1954, remains 
the largest ever nuclear test by the United States, which 
yielded an explosion equivalent to approximately 1,000 
times the power of the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima, 
and the unexpected size of the blast, combined with shift-

ing wind conditions, led to radioactive exposure of civil-
ians on multiple atolls, who were not evacuated for more 
than 48 hours after the blast; 
Whereas a 2019 study by Columbia University researchers 
found that levels of radioactive contamination on the 4 
atolls most affected by nuclear testing exceeded the levels 
of radioactive contamination in Chernobyl, Ukraine, and 
Fukushima, Japan; 
Whereas the resettlement of individuals on such atolls, which 
were later found to be unsafe due to direct exposure to 
nuclear fallout, contributed to increased cancer rates, 
birth defects, and other illnesses among the people of the 
Marshall Islands; 
Whereas the United States conducted medical research on in-
dividuals in the Marshall Islands without their knowledge 
or consent; 
Whereas, from January 1, 1977, to December 31, 1980, a 
joint task group of members of the Armed Forces and ci-
vilian employees and contractors conducted radiological 
cleanup and built the Runit Dome (also known as the 
Cactus Crater containment structure) on Enewetak Atoll 
to house more than 110,000 cubic yards of radioactively 
contaminated soil and debris; 
Whereas, in addition to the radioactive waste from the Ne-
vada Test Site that was dumped into the Enewetak La-
goon, more than 99 percent of all plutonium at Enewetak 
Atoll remains outside the Runit Dome; 
Whereas, since 2012, the Secretary of Energy has been re-
sponsible, under section 103(f)(1) of the Compact of Free 
Association Amendments Act of 2003 (48 U.S.C. 
1921b(f)(1)), for quadrennial studies of the groundwater

surrounding and in the Cactus Crater containment struc-
ture, but the Secretary has failed to complete such stud-
ies; 
Whereas, in October 2012, an official of the Department of 
Energy testified before Congress that seawater is ‘‘com-
municating’’ with the radioactive material in Cactus Cra-
ter; 
Whereas many of the members of the Armed Forces who par-
ticipated in the cleanup of Enewetak Atoll have remained 
largely ineligible for benefits related to radiation expo-
sure; 
Whereas the Government and the people of the Marshall Is-
lands have long argued that compensation and assistance 
from the United States for personal injuries, adverse ef-
fects on health, the loss of land, and property damages 
have been inadequate; 
Whereas a study by the National Cancer Institute, published 
in August 2010, found that 55 percent of the cancers in 
Rongelap Atoll and 10 percent of cancers in Utrik Atoll 
during such period may be attributable to fallout expo-
sure; 
Whereas, in section 2(c) of the Radiation Exposure Com-
pensation Act (Public Law 101–426; 42 U.S.C. 2210 
note), Congress apologized to individuals affected by 
above-ground nuclear testing in the Southwest United 
States, but the United States has made no such apology 
for the legacy of United States nuclear testing in the 
Marshall Islands; 
Whereas the Marshall Islands is one of the countries most 
vulnerable to the climate crisis;

Whereas rising sea levels threaten to engulf the entire nation, 
which has no elevation higher than six feet; 
Whereas Hilda Heine, former President of the Marshall Is-
lands, stated that a failure of developed countries to pur-
sue bolder climate action meant that her country was 
‘‘facing death row’’; 
Whereas the United States continues to have a critical na-
tional security relationship with the Marshall Islands, 
which— 
(1) is home to a facility the Joint Chiefs of Staff 
refer to as ‘‘the world’s premiere range for interconti-
nental ballistic missile testing and space operations sup-
port’’; and 
(2) in conjunction with the other Freely Associated 
States, guarantees the United States strategic control of 
an area of the Northern Pacific Ocean between the Phil-
ippines and Hawaii that is roughly the size of the conti-
nental United States; 
Whereas a sustained commitment by the United States to the 
Freely Associated States would— 
(1) ensure that the United States maintains control 
of shipping lanes in the Pacific Ocean; and 
(2) deter efforts by the Peoples Republic of China 
to alienate the people of the Freely Associated States 
from the United States; 
Whereas the Marshall Islands are more important to the na-
tional interests of the United States now than they have 
been at any time since World War II; 
Whereas President Ronald Reagan encouraged the people of 
the Marshall Islands to ratify the Compact of Free Asso-
ciation Between the United States and the Republic of

the Marshall Islands, done at Majuro June 25, 1983, by 
telling such people, ‘‘you will always be family to us’’; 
and 
Whereas the United States has a moral responsibility and a 
national security imperative— 
(1) to formally apologize to the people of the Mar-
shall Islands for the consequences of the nuclear weapons 
testing program; 
(2) to reaffirm the kinship and commitment of the 
United States to, and concern for, the people of the Free-
ly Associated States; and 
(3) to demonstrate that the United States lives up 
to its history and responsibilities in the vital Indo-Pacific 
region and elsewhere: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives

That Congress—

(A) the United States nuclear testing pro-
