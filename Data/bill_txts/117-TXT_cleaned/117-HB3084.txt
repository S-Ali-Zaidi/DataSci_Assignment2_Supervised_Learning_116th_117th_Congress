SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSES. 
6
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) The Taiwan Relations Act (Public Law 96– 
8
8; 22 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.) affirmed United States 
9
policy ‘‘to preserve and promote extensive, close, and

friendly commercial, cultural, and other relations be-
1
tween the people of the United States and the people 
2
on Taiwan, as well as the people on the China main-
3
land and all other peoples of the Western Pacific 
4
area’’. 
5
(2) Consistent with the Asia Reassurance Ini-
6
tiative Act of 2018 (Public Law 115–409), the 
7
United States has grown its strategic partnership 
8
with Taiwan’s vibrant democracy of 23,000,000 peo-
9
ple. 
10
(3) Despite a concerted campaign by the Peo-
11
ple’s Republic of China to isolate Taiwan from its 
12
diplomatic partners and from international organiza-
13
tions, including the World Health Organization, Tai-
14
wan has emerged as a global leader in the 
15
coronavirus global pandemic response, including by 
16
donating more than 2,000,000 surgical masks and 
17
other medical equipment to the United States. 
18
(4) The creation of a United States fellowship 
19
program with Taiwan would support— 
20
(A) a key priority of expanding people-to- 
21
people exchanges, which was outlined in Presi-
22

23
rity Strategy;

1
ment to Taiwan, ‘‘a leading democracy and a 
2
critical economic and security partner’’, as ex-
3
pressed in his March 2021 Interim National Se-
4
curity Strategic Guidance; and 
5
(C) April 2021 guidance from the Depart-
6
ment of State based on a review required under 
7
the Taiwan Assurance Act of 2020 (subtitle B 
8
of title III of division FF of Public Law 116–

260) to ‘‘encourage U.S. government engage-
10
ment with Taiwan that reflects our deepening 
11

12
(b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this Act are— 
13
(1) to further strengthen the United States-Tai-
14
wan strategic partnership and broaden under-
15
standing of the Indo-Pacific region by temporarily 
16
assigning officials of agencies of the United States 
17
Government to Taiwan for intensive study in Man-
18
darin Chinese and placement as Fellows with the 
19
governing authorities on Taiwan or a Taiwanese
