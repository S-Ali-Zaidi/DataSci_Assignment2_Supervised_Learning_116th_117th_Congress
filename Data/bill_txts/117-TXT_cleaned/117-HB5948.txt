(1) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds that— 
5
(A) for over half a century, scientific inves-
6
tigation and environmental protection has been 
7
the principal activity of the Federal Govern-
8
ment and United States citizens in Antarctica; 
9
(B) the National Science Foundation funds 
10
and manages the United States Antarctic Pro-
11
gram, the national program of scientific re-
12
search in Antarctica, together with associated 
13
logistical support activities, infrastructure, as 
14
well as broad environmental stewardship re-
15
sponsibilities in Antarctica; 
16
(C) land- and ship-borne tourism in Ant-
17
arctica, including tourism hat United States- 
18
based companies organize or originate, con-
19
tinues to increase at a significant rate; 
20
(D) achievement of the United States Ant-
21
arctic Program scientific objectives requires the 
22
full commitment of the operational and logistics 
23
capabilities of the Program;

Antarctica has been not to offer support or 
1
other services to private expeditions in Antarc-
2
tica, and, instead to encourage complete oper-
3
ational and financial self-sufficiency on the part 
4
of nongovernmental expeditions to Antarctica; 
5
(F) in limited emergency situations the 
6
United States may attempt, at its discretion 
7
and in accordance with international law and 
8
humanitarian principles, the rescue of private 
9
individuals provided that no unacceptable risks 
10
are posed to United States personnel and the 
11
rescue can be accomplished by the United 
12
States within locally available means; 
13
(G) increased tourism and other non-
14
governmental activities could result in addi-
15
tional health and safety, search and rescue, 
16
medical care and evacuation costs. These costs 
17
could increase the financial burden on the 
18
United States Antarctic Program, increase the 
19
risks to the safety of those involved in search 
20
and rescue, and jeopardize scientific objectives 
21
through the diversion of resources; and

23
