SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS. 
1
(a) SHORT TITLE.—This Act may be cited as the 
2
‘‘Save Democracy Act’’. 
3
(b) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
4
(1) Congress recognizes that the legitimacy of 
5
the United States representative democracy rests on 
6
the integrity of our Federal elections and confidence 
7
our citizens have in them. 
8
(2) Consistent with article I, section 4, clause 
9
1 of the Constitution of the United States and the 
10
principles of federalism, primary authority to regu-
11
late Federal elections is reserved to the States, while 
12
Congress’s role is secondary. 
13
(3) While exercising its primary role in deter-
14
mining the manner in which Federal elections shall 
15
be carried out, States must seek to protect the fair-
16
ness, accessibility, and integrity of the elections. 
17
(4) Congress should limit its secondary role in 
18
regulating Federal elections to instances in which 
19
State regulation of Federal elections has contributed 
20
to or proven unsuccessful in preventing impropriety.
