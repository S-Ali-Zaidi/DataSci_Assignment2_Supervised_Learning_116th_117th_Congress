In the case of a State plan for medical assistance 
2
under title XIX of the Social Security Act that the Sec-
3
retary of Health and Human Services determines requires 
4
State legislation (other than legislation appropriating 
5
funds) in order for the plan to meet the additional require-
6
ment imposed by the amendments made under this sec-
7
tion, the State plan shall not be regarded as failing to 
8
comply with the requirements of such title solely on the 
9
basis of its failure to meet this additional requirement be-
10
fore the first day of the first calendar quarter beginning 
11
after the close of the first regular session of the State leg-
12
islature that begins after the date of the enactment of this 
13
Act. For purposes of the previous sentence, in the case 
14
of a State that has a 2-year legislative session, each year 
15
of such session shall be deemed to be a separate regular 
16
session of the State legislature.
