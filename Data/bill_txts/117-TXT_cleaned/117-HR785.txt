Whereas the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1001 
et seq.) was focused on increasing postsecondary access 
and success for students, particularly including low-in-
come and first-generation students; 
Whereas the Act helped usher in programs necessary for 
postsecondary access, retention, and completion for low- 
income, first-generation college students, including the 
Federal TRIO Programs under chapter 1 of subpart 2 of 
part A of title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 
(20 U.S.C. 1070a–11 et seq.) and the Federal Pell Grant 
program under section 401 of the Higher Education Act 
of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070a); 
Whereas the Federal TRIO Programs under chapter 1 of 
subpart 2 of part A of title IV of the Higher Education 
Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070a–11 et seq.) are the pri-
mary national effort supporting underrepresented stu-
dents in postsecondary education and are designed to 
identify individuals from low-income, first-generation 
backgrounds and prepare them for postsecondary edu-
cation, provide support services, and motivate and pre-
pare students for doctoral programs; 
Whereas the Federal Pell Grant program under section 401 
of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070a) 
is the primary Federal investment in financial aid for 
low-income college students, and is used by students at 
institutions of higher education of their choice; 
Whereas a ‘‘first-generation college student’’ means an indi-
vidual whose parents did not complete a baccalaureate 
degree, or in the case of any individual who regularly re-
sided with and received support from only one parent, an 
individual whose parent did not complete a baccalaureate 
degree;
