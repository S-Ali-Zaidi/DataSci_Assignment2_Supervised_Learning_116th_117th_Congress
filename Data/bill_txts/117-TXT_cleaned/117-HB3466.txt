SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

•HR 3466 IH
(1) In 1921, Greenwood (a community in 
1
Tulsa, Oklahoma) was one of the most prosperous 
2
African-American communities in the United States. 
3
At the time, an estimated 11,000 African Americans 
4
lived in Greenwood, and its commercial district was 
5
known nationally as the ‘‘Black Wall Street’’. The 
6
community boasted two newspapers, over a dozen 
7
churches, and hundreds of African-American-owned 
8
businesses. 
9
(2) On the evening of May 31, 1921, the Afri-
10
can-American Greenwood community of Tulsa, Okla-
11
homa was ravaged by a White mob, some of whom 
12
were deputized and armed by law enforcement. By 
13
the conclusion of the massacre at midday, June 1, 
14
virtually every building in a 42-square-block area of 
15
the community—homes, schools, churches, and busi-
16
nesses—was burned to the ground and thousands 
17
were left homeless. Over 1,200 homes were de-
18
stroyed. Every church, school, and business in 
19
Greenwood was set on fire. Approximately 8,000 Af-
20
rican Americans were left homeless and penniless. 
21
Unable to rebuild, thousands of residents spent the 
22
winter of 1921 to 1922 in tents. 
23
(3) Credible evidence supports the belief that 
24
approximately 300 African Americans were killed

during the massacre, but the exact death toll re-
1
mains unknown. 
2
(4) In the wake of the destruction, a State-con-
3
vened grand jury officially placed responsibility for 
4
the violence on the African-American community, ex-
5
onerating Whites of all responsibility. No one was 
6
ever prosecuted or punished for the violent criminal 
7
acts. 
8
(5) None of the nearly 200 contemporaneously 
9
filed lawsuits by residents and property owners in 
10
Greenwood were successful in recovering damages 
11
from insurance companies to assist in the recon-
12
struction of the community. After the city attempted 
13
to block their redevelopment efforts, victims were 
14
forced to rebuild with their own resources or aban-
15
don the community. 
16
(6) State and local governments suppressed or 
17
ignored issues and claims arising from the 1921 
18
massacre, effectively excising it from collective mem-
19
ory, until the Oklahoma Legislature created a com-
20
mission to study the event in 1997. The commis-
21
sion’s February 28, 2001, report uncovered new in-
22
formation and detailed, for the first time, the extent 
23
of involvement by the State and city government in

prosecuting and erasing evidence of the massacre 
1
(Okla. Stat. Tit. 74 Section 8000.1 (West 2005)). 
2
(7) The documentation assembled by the ‘‘1921 
3
Tulsa Race Riot Commission’’ provides strong evi-
4
dence that some local municipal and county officials 
5
failed to take actions to calm or contain the situa-
6
tion once violence erupted and, in some cases, be-
7
came participants in the subsequent violence, and 
8
even deputized and armed many Whites who were 
9
part of a mob that killed, looted, and burned down 
10
the Greenwood area. 
11
(8) Based on information contained in the re-
12
port, the Greenwood claimants filed suit, pursuant 
13
to the laws codified in sections 1981, 1983, and 
14
1985 of title 42 of the United States Code and the 
15
14th Amendment, seeking damages for the injuries 
16
sustained in the massacre as a result of the govern-
17
ment’s involvement. Their claims were dismissed as 
18
time barred by the court, and so were not deter-
19
mined on the merits (382 F.3d 1206 (10th Cir. 
20
2004), rehrg en banc denied (with dissent), 391

(1) To ensure that laws governing claims made 
1
in connection with the Tulsa, Oklahoma race mas-
2
sacre of 1921 and its aftermath further the United 
3
States policy of providing compensation to any 
4
Greenwood race massacre victim, who was physically 
5
injured or killed or who had their property destroyed 
6
or taken as a result of the actions of the individuals 
7
acting under color of State, county, or municipal au-
8
thorization, their heirs, and beneficiaries. 
9
(2) To ensure that claims made in connection 
10
with the Tulsa, Oklahoma race massacre of 1921 
11
and its aftermath are not unfairly barred by statutes 
12
of limitations or laches or other similar provision of 
13
any applicable law relating to the timeliness of the 
14
filing of claims that might prevent a claim from 
15
being heard on its merits, or any notice require-
16
ments imposed by State law, but are resolved in a 
17
just and fair manner.
