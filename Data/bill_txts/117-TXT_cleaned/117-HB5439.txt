SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Children increasingly consume digital enter-
8
tainment on the internet and are uniquely suscep-
9
tible to manipulation online, given their lack of im-

portant neurological and psychological capabilities 
1
which are developed later in adulthood. 
2
(2) Today’s digital media environment, which is 
3
constantly evolving and now includes high-tech expe-
4
riences, such as augmented reality and virtual re-
5
ality, is largely designed in non-transparent ways to 
6
ensure children interact with content that reflect the 
7
interests and goals of content producers, online plat-
8
forms, and marketers. 
9
(3) Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and 
10
other complex systems are used to make continuous 
11
decisions about how online content for children can 
12
be personalized to increase engagement. 
13
(4) Online companies gather, analyze, and use 
14
data for behavioral marketing directed at children. 
15
(5) Companies employ sophisticated strategies, 
16
including neuromarketing, to affect consumer behav-
17
ior and manipulate online users’ decision making. 
18
(6) Branded content in various forms of multi-
19
media, including native advertising and influencer 
20
marketing, exposes children to marketing that is in-
21
herently manipulative or purposely disguised as en-
22
tertainment or other information.
