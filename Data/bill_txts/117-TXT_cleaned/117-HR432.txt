civic leaders of West Texas, recognized the need for im-
proved VA healthcare and access; 
Whereas Lubbock, Texas, a city with a population of nearly 
300,000, was 200 miles from the nearest VA clinic; 
Whereas data provided by the VA showed that of 323,000 
veterans in West Texas, only 167,000 were enrolled in 
the VA and this clinic will drastically improve the 
healthcare of those veterans; 
Whereas the City of Lubbock averages zero homeless veterans 
per 1,000 veterans; 
Whereas the Lubbock VA clinic— 
(1) will provide radiology and cardiology services; 
(2) will provide CT, MRI, and X-ray services; 
(3) will provide mental and behavioral health serv-
ices; 
(4) will contribute economic growth and jobs to the 
local economy; 
(5) will alleviate the inconvenience of traveling over 
200 miles to receive care; and 
(6) will be capable of assisting a larger number of 
veterans on a day-to-day basis: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives cele-
