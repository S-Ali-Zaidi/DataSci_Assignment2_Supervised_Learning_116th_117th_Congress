A BILL 
To establish collective bargaining rights for college athletes, 
and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘College Athlete Right 
4
to Organize Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) The National Labor Relations Act (29 
8
U.S.C. 151 et seq.) seeks to remedy the inequality 
9
of bargaining power between employees and employ-
10

ers primarily through establishing and protecting the 
1
rights of employees to self-organize and designate 
2
representatives of their own choosing for the purpose 
3
of negotiating the terms and conditions of their em-
4
ployment or other mutual aid or protection. 
5
(2) Labor organizations often originate to rem-
6
edy unfair and exploitative labor practices by em-
7
ployers through assisting employees in securing more 
8
equitable terms and conditions of their employment, 
9
including fair compensation and safe working condi-
10
tions, which individual employees would be unlikely 
11
to negotiate successfully for on their own. 
12
(3) Labor organizations serve unique and essen-
13
tial purposes for professional athletes competing in 
14
sports leagues, where it is desirable to establish uni-
15
form rules and standards across multiple employers. 
16
These rules and standards bear significant con-
17
sequences to the athletes in terms of compensation, 
18
health and safety, and the ability or lack thereof for 
19
athletes to choose their employer, among other 
20
issues related to the athletes’ well-being. 
21
(4) The formation of labor organizations rep-
22
resenting athletes in professional sports leagues in 
23
the United States has helped end exploitative prac-
24
tices by team owners and management, particularly

•HR 3895 IH
through establishing collective-bargaining agree-
1
ments that have secured athletes a fair share of the 
2
revenues their talent and labor produces, as well as 
3
more equitable terms of their employment and pro-
4
tections for their short- and long-term health. 
5
(5) College athletes face exploitative and unfair 
6
labor practices by the National Collegiate Athletic 
7
Association (referred to in this section as the 
8
‘‘NCAA’’) and its member institutions, primarily 
9
through the denial of the basic economic and labor 
10
rights of such athletes, which the NCAA and its 
11
member institutions have justified by defining col-
12
lege athletes as amateurs. 
13
(6) The NCAA and its member institutions 
14
have denied college athletes a fair wage for their 
15
labor by colluding to cap compensation; they main-
16
tain strict and exacting control over the terms and 
17
conditions of college athletes’ labor; and they exer-
18
cise the ability to terminate an athlete’s eligibility to 
19
compete if the athlete violates these terms and con-
20
ditions. 
21
(7) College athletes exhibit the markers of em-
22
ployment as established under the common law defi-
23
nition of the term ‘‘employee’’: They perform a valu-
24
able service for their respective colleges under a con-
25

tract for hire in the form of grant-in-aid agreements; 
1
these agreements assert significant control over how 
2
athletes perform their work and the conditions under 
3
which they work; and they receive compensation in 
4
the form of grant-in-aid and stipends in exchange 
5
for their athletic services. 
6
(8) To establish more equitable terms and con-
7
ditions for college athletes’ labor, college athletes 
8
need representation of their own choosing to nego-
9
tiate collective-bargaining agreements with their re-
10
spective colleges and the athletic conferences that 
11
help set rules and standards across an entire league. 
12
(9) To organize effectively, college athletes 
13
must be able to form collective bargaining units 
14
across institutions of higher education that compete 
15
against each other, including within athletic con-
16
ferences; and, accordingly, to establish effective col-
17
lective bargaining rights for college athletes under 
18
this Act, the National Labor Relations Act must be 
19
amended to cover both private and public institu-
20
tions of higher education to the extent that college 
21
athletes attending such institutions fall within the 
22
definition of ‘‘employee’’ under that Act, as amended 
23
by this Act.

(10) The Constitution of the United States 
1
vests Congress with the power to regulate commerce 
2
between the States, and intercollegiate sports, which 
3
are maintained by athletic associations that host 
4
competitions between colleges across States, involves 
5
interstate commerce that generates annual revenue 
6
of more than $15,000,000,000. 
7
(11) Intercollegiate sports’ significant engage-
8
ment in interstate commerce justifies application of 
9
the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 151 et 
10
seq.) to regulate the labor market within which pub-
11
lic and private institutions of higher education com-
12
pete and set rules pertaining to the wages and work-
13
ing conditions of college athletes.
