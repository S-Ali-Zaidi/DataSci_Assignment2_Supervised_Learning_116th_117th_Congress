RESOLUTION 
Expressing the hope for justice for the victims of Bloody 
Sunday, one of the most tragic of days during the Trou-
bles, on its 50th anniversary as well as acknowledging 
the progress made in fostering peace in Northern Ireland 
and on the island of Ireland in recent decades. 
Whereas, on January 30, 1972, 26 unarmed civilians were 
shot by British soldiers during a protest that began 
peacefully in Derry, resulting in the death of 14 individ-
uals in a massacre now known as Bloody Sunday; 
Whereas, as a result of the soldiers’ unjustifiable use of force, 
the individuals known as John ‘‘Jackie’’ Duddy, Patrick 
‘‘Paddy’’ Doherty, Bernard ‘‘Barney’’ McGuigan, Hugh

Gilmour, Kevin McElhinney, Michael Kelly, John Young, 
William Nash, Michael McDaid, James Wray, Gerald 
Donaghy, Gerard McKinney, William McKinney, and 
John Johnston tragically lost their lives; 
Whereas Bloody Sunday represents one of the most signifi-
cant and deadly injustices to take place during the Trou-
bles, and exacerbated the conflict in Northern Ireland; 
Whereas none of those shot by British Army soldiers posed 
a threat of causing death or serious injury, or were doing 
anything else that could justify their shooting; 
Whereas the families of the victims of Bloody Sunday were 
denied for decades an honest and comprehensive assess-
ment of the events that took place on Bloody Sunday; 
Whereas, in 1998, after campaigns from the families of those 
injured and killed on Bloody Sunday, a second inquiry 
was established by the British Government; 
Whereas this second Bloody Sunday Inquiry found without 
doubt that the shootings that took place on Bloody Sun-
day were the result of wrongful actions taken by British 
soldiers; 
Whereas, on June 15, 2010, then-Prime Minister David 
Cameron while addressing the House of Commons apolo-
gized on behalf of the British Government saying that 
the events that took place on Bloody Sunday were ‘‘un-
justified’’, ‘‘unjustifiable’’, and ‘‘wrong’’; 
Whereas despite these findings and acknowledgment made by 
the British Government, none of the individuals involved 
in the unlawful use of force that led to the murder of 14 
innocent civilians on Bloody Sunday have been held ac-
countable;

Whereas the lack of accountability and justice provided to 
those who perished from this unlawful use of force on 
Bloody Sunday is both shameful and dangerous; 
Whereas accountability and justice for the victims of Bloody 
Sunday would represent one step toward addressing 
Northern Ireland’s legacy of violence and promoting rec-
onciliation; 
Whereas an environment which fosters accountability and jus-
tice for the events of the Troubles must be established by 
British authorities and subsequently maintained; 
Whereas the full implementation of the Good Friday Agree-
ment with a devolved government in Northern Ireland as 
well as healthy ‘‘north-south’’ and ‘‘east-west’’ relations 
provide appropriate, useful, and productive avenues for 
discussion and negotiation to prevent violence, uphold 
peace, maintain stability, and promote the interests of all 
parties and communities involved; 
Whereas the avoidance of a hard border on the island of Ire-
land is essential for maintaining the peace, resulting from 
the Good Friday Agreement; 
Whereas the full implementation of the Northern Ireland 
Protocol as agreed upon as part of the United Kingdom’s 
withdrawal from the European Union will help preserve 
peace and stability on the island of Ireland; 
Whereas in the political and societal realm, intercommunity 
discussion is essential for maintaining peace; 
Whereas it is in the interest of all parties in Northern Ireland 
to foster intercommunity relations as well as integration 
in civil and societal structures to promote communication 
and mutual understanding; and

Whereas, on January 30, 2022, peace activists, concerned in-
dividuals, and the descendants of those lost to this vio-

commit themselves to the peace process established by 
the Good Friday Agreement: Now, therefore, be it
