(1) President Biden’s recent Executive order on

COVID–19 vaccine mandates is both unconstitu-

made and known between an individual and his or 
5
her doctor.

an infringement upon an individual’s freedom,

not properly consider the strength of natural immu-

14
not to be vaccinated against COVID–19.
