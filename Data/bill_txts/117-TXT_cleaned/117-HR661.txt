Whereas dizziness accounts for 2.6 percent of all primary 
care visits and nearly 2.5 percent of emergency depart-
ment visits; 
Whereas vestibular disorder patients may consult four or 
more physicians and spend 50 months or more in the 
search for a diagnosis; 
Whereas the Vestibular Disorders Association celebrates 
‘‘Balance Awareness Week’’ to reduce the time it takes 
to diagnose a vestibular disorder by helping patients rec-
ognize their symptoms and encouraging them to seek 
help from a qualified vestibular specialist; and 
Whereas the week of September 19, 2021, through Sep-
tember 25, 2021, would be an appropriate week to des-
ignate as ‘‘Balance Awareness Week’’: Now, therefore, be 
it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the designation of ‘‘Balance 
2
Awareness Week’’; and 
3
(2) recognizes the importance of raising public
