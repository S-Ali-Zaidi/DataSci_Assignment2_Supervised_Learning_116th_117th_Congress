Congress finds the following:

H5088
2 
•HR 5088 IH
(1) Funds derived from the sale of minerals in 
1
Afghanistan will be used by the Taliban and its al-
2
lies to finance terrorist and military activities, over-
3
throw legitimate governments, subvert international 
4
efforts to promote peace and stability, and commit 
5
horrifying atrocities against unarmed civilians. 
6
(2) The United States spent 20 years and two 
7
trillion dollars to attempt to bring peace and inter-
8
national comity to Afghanistan, only to see the 
9
Taliban supported by other international actors 
10
overthrow the legal government in a matter of hours. 
11
(3) The United States spent tens of millions of 
12
dollars funding critical mineral surveys and mineral 
13
exploration to help build an alternative economy for 
14
the legitimate peaceful Government of Afghanistan 
15
and that data has now fallen into the hands of the 
16
Taliban and its allies. 
17
(4) Prohibiting the Taliban and its allies from 
18
profiting from the use of these mineral resources will 
19
ensure that threats to international peace and secu-
20
rity posed by the Taliban will not be funded with 
21
these minerals.
