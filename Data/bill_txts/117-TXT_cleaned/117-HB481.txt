Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

(a) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds that—

•HR 481 IH
(1) floods are the most common natural dis-
1
aster in the United States, causing injuries, damage, 
2
and destruction in all 50 States since 2012; 
3
(2) recent storms have strained the capacity of 
4
many local and State governments to respond and 
5
recover, necessitating significant increases in dis-
6
aster assistance from the Federal Government; 
7
(3) the Congressional Budget Office has cau-
8
tioned that U.S. economic losses associated with 
9
heavy precipitation, storm surges, and hurricane 
10
winds could average $54 billion every year and re-
11
quire Federal spending averaging $17 billion per 
12
year; 
13
(4) according to the Federal Emergency Man-
14
agement Agency, nearly 250 weather-related disas-
15
ters in the United States have caused at least $1 bil-
16
lion in damage each since 1980; 
17
(5) since 2005 alone, Federal funding for dis-
18
aster assistance has exceeded $450 billion, including 
19
over $19 billion in supplemental appropriations 
20
signed into law in June of 2019; 
21
(6) after reviewing just a portion of the Federal 
22
Government property inventory, the Office of Man-
23
agement and Budget identified significant flood

risks, including more than $80 billion in Federal as-
1
sets located in designated flood zones; 
2
(7) a 2017 study of Federal mitigation grants 
3
conducted by National Institute of Building Sciences 
4
Multihazard Mitigation Council demonstrated that 
5
mitigation investment can save the Nation, on aver-
6
age, $6 in future disaster costs for every $1 spent 
7
on hazard mitigation; and 
8
(8) the Government Accountability Office has 
9
recommended that enhanced Federal and local ef-
10
forts to improve resilience can reduce the effects and 
11
costs of future disasters. 
12
(b) PURPOSE.—It is the purpose of this Act— 
13
(1) to improve the resiliency of communities 
14
and assets of the Federal Government against flood-
15
ing, thereby limiting damage, reducing the need to 
16
rebuild after floods, and saving taxpayer dollars; and 
17
(2) provide a flexible framework for full consid-
18
eration of sensible resilience alternatives without re-
19
quiring any specific construction or mitigation meth-
20
ods.

SEC. 3. FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT. 
22
(a) EVALUATION OF POTENTIAL FOR FLOODING.— 
23
When carrying out an agency action involving a federally 
24
funded project, the head of each agency shall evaluate the 
25
15:40 Feb 14, 2021
H481
4 
•HR 481 IH
potential for flooding throughout the planned lifetime or 
1
duration of the federally funded project to— 
2
(1) reduce the risk of financial and property 
3
losses, including taxpayer losses resulting from 
4
floods; 
5
(2) take practicable steps toward ensuring that 
6
Federal resources will be allocated to structures and 
7
projects that will remain flood resistant throughout 
8
their intended design life; 
9
(3) preserve and utilize, to the extent reason-
10
able, the capacity of natural systems to protect 
11
against the damages of flooding; 
12
(4) prevent, to the extent possible, the disrup-
13
tion of critical services during flood events, including 
14
the closure of strategic transportation routes, inac-
15
cessibility of health care facilities, or loss of power 
16
or essential water and wastewater services; and 
17
(5) minimize the impact of current and future 
18
floods on human safety, health, and welfare. 
19
(b) DETERMINATION REGARDING SITING IN FLOOD-
20
PLAIN.—In carrying out the review of agency actions re-
21
quired under Executive Order 11988 (42 Fed. Reg. 
22
26951; relating to floodplain management), the head of 
23
each agency shall determine whether the federally funded 
24
project (as such term is defined in subsection (e)) under

•HR 481 IH
review is sited in a floodplain currently or is expected to 
1
lie within or take place in a floodplain during the expected 
2
duration or design life of the project, taking into consider-
3
ation— 
4
(1) the most recent flood insurance rate map 
5
published by the Administrator of the Federal Emer-
6
gency Management Agency for the community in 
7
which the project shall take place, including prelimi-
8
nary and advisory maps prepared by the Adminis-
9
trator; 
10
(2) relevant and available assessments of future 
11
flooding vulnerabilities conducted or used by the 
12
agency, other agencies, or State or local govern-
13
ments; 
14
(3) additional available information regarding 
15
expected future conditions, including changes in land 
16
use, watershed characteristics, and infrastructure; 
17
and 
18
(4) additional available hydrologic and hydrau-
19
lic data from public and private sources regarding 
20
current and future flood risk, including information 
21
on expected changes in precipitation patterns, ero-
22
sion, and sea level. 
23
(c) ALTERNATE DESIGN LEVELS FOR RESILIENT IN-
24
FRASTRUCTURE.—If, after considering the available infor-
25
15:40 Feb 14, 2021
H481

•HR 481 IH
mation required under subsection (b), the head of an agen-
1
cy determines that such information is not adequate or 
2
sufficiently credible to understand and characterize cur-
3
rent and future flood risks to the project, the head of the 
4
agency shall use the following design standards in evalu-
5
ating resilience for or alternatives to the investment: 
6
(1) NON-CRITICAL
PROJECTS.—If the project 
7
under review is not considered critical, the head of 
8
the agency shall assume, at a minimum, that flood 
9
heights would be expected to be 2 feet higher than 
10
the base flood elevation for the current 1 percent an-
11
nual chance flood or the flood elevation for the cur-
12
rent 0.2 percent annual chance flood, whichever is 
13
greater. 
14
(2) CRITICAL PROJECTS.—If the project under 
15
review is considered critical, the head of the agency 
16
shall assume, at a minimum, that flood heights 
17
would be expected to be 3 feet higher than the base 
18
flood elevation for the current 1 percent annual 
19
chance flood or 1 foot higher than the flood elevation 
20
for the current 0.2 percent annual chance flood, 
21
whichever is greater. 
22
(3) RESILIENCE STANDARD.—In evaluating re-
23
silience options, the flood heights specified in pre-
24
ceding paragraphs shall establish a standard design 
25
15:40 Feb 14, 2021
H481

•HR 481 IH
level to which a structure or facility evaluated under 
1
this subsection shall be made functionally resilient. 
2
This may include using structural or nonstructural 
3
methods to reduce or prevent damage, elevating a 
4
structure, or where appropriate, designing it to 
5
adapt to, withstand, and rapidly recover from the 
6
corresponding flood event. 
7
(4) ALTERNATIVES.—In evaluating alternatives, 
8
including alternative sites and designs, the head of 
9
the agency shall fully consider the ability of natural 
10
systems and nature-based processes to achieve or 
11
support flood risk reduction and cost savings over 
12
the long term. 
13
(d) GUIDELINES FOR AGENCIES.— 
14
(1) GUIDELINES.—Agencies shall amend their 
15
regulations and procedures to incorporate the resil-
16
ience standards established under subsections (b) 
17
and (c) to establish new flood risk management 
18
standards. Agency standards shall, at a minimum, 
19
incorporate provisions to implement subsection (a) 
20
and shall require that the construction of Federal 
21
structures and facilities and construction of struc-
22
tures and facilities using Federal funds be in accord-
23
ance with the standards and criteria established 
24
under subsections (b) and (c) and comply with appli-

3
the National Flood Insurance Program. 
4
(2) ISSUANCE.—Not later than the expiration 
5
of the 18-month period beginning on the date of the 
6

7
Floodplain Management Task Force shall issue 
8
guidelines to be used by agencies in meeting the re-
9
quirements of this Act. 
10
(3) REQUIRED CONTENT.—At a minimum, such 
11
guidelines shall— 
12
(A) establish appropriate tracking and re-
13
porting procedures for agencies to follow; and 
14
(B) establish limits on the extent to which 
15
exceptions for a particular agency may be al-
16
lowed in cases in which an exception is in the 
17
interest of national security, is deemed to be an 
18
emergency action, or is determined to present a 
19
conflict with other existing statutory require-
20
ments. 
21
(4) OTHER
CONTENT.—Such guidelines may 
22
also identify cases in which an agency may conduct 
23
a general review of types of projects that are similar
