Whereas the McGovern-Dole Program was established by sec-
tion 3107 of the Farm Security and Rural Investment 
Act of 2002 (7 U.S.C. 1736o–1) to procure agricultural 
commodities and provide financial and technical assist-
ance to carry out preschool and school food for education 
programs in foreign countries and maternal, infant, and 
child nutrition programs for pregnant women, nursing 
mothers, infants, and children who are 5 years of age or 
younger; 
Whereas the McGovern-Dole Program has provided over 5.5 
billion school meals benefitting over 31 million school-age 
children and their communities; 
Whereas the McGovern-Dole Program has been successfully 
administered by the Foreign Agricultural Service of the 
Department of Agriculture; 
Whereas the McGovern-Dole Program is a key program of 
the Department of Agriculture aligned with the govern-
mentwide Global Food Security Strategy; 
Whereas in fiscal year 2021 alone, McGovern-Dole Program 
projects have directly benefitted more than 4.5 million 
children and community members through the distribu-
tion of United States-produced commodities that provide 
daily nutritious and high-quality meals and mitigate food 
insecurity; 
Whereas the McGovern-Dole Program partners with Amer-
ican farmers, who provide 46,770 metric tons (‘‘MT’’) of 
food commodities in support of fiscal year 2021 McGov-
ern-Dole Program grants in Central America, Africa, and 
Asia; 
Whereas the McGovern-Dole Program complements United

chased locally to support farmers and markets within 
their own communities and to build the capacity of local 
governments and communities to continue and sustain 
the benefits of the McGovern-Dole Program into the fu-
ture; 
Whereas during the COVID–19 pandemic when school clo-
sures were commonplace, the McGovern-Dole Program 
effectively shifted from providing meals in schools to pro-
viding take-home rations and distributed approximately 
23,000 MT of commodities donated by the United States 
and 550 MT of locally procured commodities to more 
than 1,700,000 McGovern-Dole Program participants 
and their families across 26 active projects, ensuring that 
children continued to receive daily meals and learn while 
at home; 
Whereas the McGovern-Dole Program recognizes the value of 
educating young girls and contributes to overcoming the 
barriers they encounter in accessing a high-quality edu-
cation by promoting equality and the reduction of gender- 
based violence; 
Whereas school meals provide an incentive for families to 
send girls to school and help girls to stay in school, effec-
tively preventing early marriage and delaying first preg-
nancy, which can trap young women in poverty and limit 
their future potential; 
Whereas the McGovern-Dole Program strengthens local com-
munity health and education through the formation of 
parent-teacher associations, teacher training, and improv-
ing the infrastructure of schools, classrooms, commodity 
storerooms, latrines, and water sources; and
