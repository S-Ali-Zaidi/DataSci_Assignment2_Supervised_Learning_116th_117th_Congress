17
the relevance and significance of STEM careers and 
18
expose students to role models in the fields of STEM 
19
and near-peer mentors to foster their interest in 
20
STEM; 
21
(2) Partnerships with education providers, 
22
STEM focused competitions, and academic pro-
23
grams, have become important aspects of private 
24
sector efforts to strengthen the STEM workforce;
