Congress finds the following:

•HR 9040 IH
(1) In the United States, there are approxi-
1
mately 1 in 4 adults with disabilities, 1 in 10 indi-
2
viduals with disabilities who are able to become 
3
pregnant, and approximately 4,100,000 parents with 
4
disabilities. 
5
(2) All people, including individuals with dis-
6
abilities, have the right to decide if, when, and how 
7
to start and raise a family. 
8
(3) Title II and III of the Americans with Dis-
9
abilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12131 et seq. and 
10
12181 et seq.), section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act 
11
of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794), and section 1557 of the 
12
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (42 
13
U.S.C. 18116) provide individuals with disabilities 
14
with the right to equitably access and receive health 
15
care. 
16
(4) Disabled people face unique barriers when 
17
accessing reproductive health care, including accessi-
18
bility at health care facilities, lack of accessible med-
19
ical diagnostic equipment, barriers to accessible trav-
20
el, delay in receiving preventative services, and lack 
21
of health care providers with training and knowledge 
22
on the needs of individuals with disabilities receiving 
23
reproductive health care.

•HR 9040 IH
(5) The United States Access Board has estab-
1
lished standards for accessible medical diagnostic 
2
equipment, however without enforceable standards 
3
adopted by the Department of Health and Human 
4
Services and Department of Justice, systemic im-
5
provements in the availability of accessible medical 
6
diagnostic equipment will not be achieved. 
7
(6) Disabled people have an equal right to re-
8
productive autonomy, but harmful stereotypes create 
9
barriers to getting care that respects that autonomy. 
10
(7) Laws that restrict access to reproductive 
11
health 
care, 
including 
abortion 
care, 
12
disproportionally harm people who already face bar-
13
riers to reproductive health care which includes dis-
14
abled people. 
15
(8) Individuals with and without disabilities 
16
want children at the same frequency, but individuals 
17
with disabilities experience less likelihood of receiv-
18
ing contraception counseling and timely prenatal 
19
care, experience a higher rate of sterilization, and 
20
are at a greater risk for adverse pregnancy out-
21
comes. 
22
(9) Diversity and inclusion in the health care 
23
workforce is a critical factor in the delivery of high- 
24
quality, culturally competent health care and im-

proves patient outcomes. However, the rate of stu-
1
dents and trainees with disabilities in medical and 
2
allied health education remains low compared to

those without disabilities.
