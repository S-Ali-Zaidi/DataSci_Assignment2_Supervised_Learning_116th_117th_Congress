CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 
Supporting United States bids to host the Men’s and 
Women’s Rugby World Cup tournaments. 
Whereas, on October 20, 2021, USA Rugby, the national 
governing body for the sport in the United States, and 
partner organizations publicly launched the United States 
bid to host the Men’s Rugby World Cup in 2027 or 2031, 
and the Women’s Rugby World Cup in 2029; 
Whereas rugby is one of the fastest growing sports in the 
United States, with more than 100,000 USA Rugby 
members playing in over 2,500 clubs nationwide, college 
and high school age players comprising nearly half of the 
community, and new professional and top-level rugby or-
ganizations continuing to build interest in the game;

Whereas the Women’s Rugby World Cup tournament will 
bring teams from 16 nations and the Men’s Rugby World 
Cup tournament will bring teams from 20 nations, pre-
senting an opportunity for the United States as host 
country to demonstrate the highest achievable standards 
for hosting a global sporting event and to serve as a 
benchmark for future organizers; 
Whereas hosting Men’s and Women’s Rugby World Cup tour-
naments in the United States brings with it the prospect 
of record-setting attendance and financial performance, 
with recent Rugby World Cup events bringing more than 
242,000 fans from around the world to host countries 
and more than 1,700,000 spectators to stadiums, allow-
ing revenues and tourism generated by the competition to 
be used for the further development of rugby and eco-
nomic growth throughout our Nation; 
Whereas 28 American cities are working with USA Rugby to 
plan for hosting upcoming Men’s and Women’s Rugby 
World Cup matches, with each of these cities embodying 
the diversity and enthusiasm of the world’s leading sports 
market and guaranteeing each participating team and its 
followers an exciting and welcoming atmosphere; 
Whereas the United States offers a valuable and receptive 
market within which to further develop the sport of 
rugby, which in turn will have significant impact on and 
off the field through the sport’s contributions to healthy 
lifestyles, community development, and economic growth; 
Whereas the United States possesses all necessary state-of- 
the-art infrastructure in its stadiums and potential host 
cities to ensure that the tournaments set a new standard 
of quality, comfort, security, and safety for players, offi-
cials, spectators, media, and sponsors alike;

Whereas hosting Men’s and Women’s Rugby World Cup tour-
naments in the United States would serve as a tremen-
dous impetus to national and international goodwill, as 
the competition would bring people from many nations, 
along with a diverse domestic audience, together to enjoy 
a sport rooted in respect, inclusivity, and integrity; and 
Whereas pursuant to World Rugby bidding procedures, cer-
tain Federal agencies have been asked to issue guaran-
tees that, upon authorization or appropriation, would es-
tablish the conditions required to help make Men’s and 
Women’s Rugby World Cup tournaments hosted in the 
United States the most successful in history: Now, there-
fore, be it
