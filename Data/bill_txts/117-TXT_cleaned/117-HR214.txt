RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
Iran must cease enriching uranium to 20 percent purity 
and abandon its pursuit of a nuclear weapon. 
Whereas it is in the vital interest of the United States and 
its allies to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons; 
Whereas Iran remains a leading state sponsor of terrorism, 
continues to develop and test missile technology in defi-
ance of United Nations Security Council resolutions, 
threatens United States forces and interests, continues to 
imprison American citizens, threatens regional allies and 
partners, and utilizes the Islamic Revolutionary Guard 
Corps-Quds Force (IRGC–QF) and proxy militias like 
Hezbollah to destabilize the Middle East;

•HRES 214 IH 
Whereas Iran’s malign activities and continued defiance of 
the Non-Proliferation Treaty threaten regional and global 
security; 
Whereas, on January 4, 2021, Iran announced it will further 
enrich uranium to 20 percent purity, which will signifi-
cantly reduce the time needed to acquire the weapons- 
grade uranium for a bomb to as little as 3 months; 
Whereas civilian nuclear energy plants require material en-
riched to no more than 3 to 4 percent, and any civilian 
needs above that can be satisfied by purchasing material 
abroad at substantially reduced costs; and 
Whereas this action is escalatory and should be taken as a 
serious message that the Iranian Government is not in-
terested in joining the community of nations: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-
1
resentatives that— 
2
(1) the Government of Iran’s decision to enrich 
3
uranium to 20 percent purity is escalatory and in-
4
tended to decrease breakout time to produce a nu-
5
clear weapon; and 
6
(2) the Government of Iran should immediately 
7
reverse its decision to enrich uranium to 20 percent 
8
and abandon its pursuit of a nuclear weapon.
