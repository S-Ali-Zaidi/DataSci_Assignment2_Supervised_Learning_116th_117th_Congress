•HR 1553 IH
(1) An estimated 6.5 million people in the 
1
United States, or 1 in 50 people, have an 
2
unruptured brain aneurysm. 
3
(2) Each year, an estimated 30,000 people in 
4
the United States suffer a brain aneurysm rupture. 
5
Ruptured brain aneurysms are fatal in about 50 per-
6
cent of cases. Of those who survive, about 66 per-
7
cent suffer some permanent neurological deficit. 
8
(3) Brain aneurysms are more likely to occur in 
9
women than in men by a 3 to 2 ratio. This Act rep-
10
resents all those who have been affected and died 
11
due to a ruptured brain aneurysm, and their loved 
12
ones. People who experienced a brain aneurysm rup-
13
ture include the following: 
14
(A) Ellie Helton. On July 16, 2014, Ellie 
15
Helton, a vibrant, loving 14-year-old from Apex, 
16
North Carolina, passed away as a result of a 
17
ruptured aneurysm, stunning her parents, two 
18
sisters, and many, many loved ones. A day ear-
19
lier, on her second day of high school, she woke 
20
up with a terrible headache after a plum-sized 
21
aneurysm on her brain stem ruptured. While 
22
she suffered headaches throughout her life, she 
23
was never diagnosed. Ellie was an avid reader 
24
and excellent student, loved the arts, and was

incredibly creative. She had an unwavering, 
1
constant love for the family and friends in her 
2
life. 
3
(B) Lisa Colagrossi. On March 20, 2015, 
4
Lisa Colagrossi—WABC Eyewitness News re-
5
porter, wife of 17 years, and mother of two 
6
sons—unexpectedly passed away at the age of 
7
49 years after suffering a massive ruptured 
8
brain aneurysm. Despite experiencing one of 
9
the classic warning signs of a brain aneurysm 
10
(the ‘‘worst headache of my life’’), Lisa’s pass-
11
ing came as a tremendous shock to her family 
12
and friends, who did not know what a brain an-
13
eurysm was, let alone its signs and symptoms. 
14
She is remembered for being a loving wife, a 
15
mother, and a successful reporter, and for her 
16
love of the New York Rangers. 
17
(C) Kristen Shafer Englert. On November 
18
24, 2013, Kristen Shafer Englert, a devoted 
19
wife, mother, daughter, sister, aunt, and friend, 
20
passed away from a ruptured brain aneurysm 
21
at the age of 25, just weeks after giving birth 
22
to her son. Prior to her passing, she went to the 
23
emergency room with symptoms of a brain an-
24
eurysm and was sent home without a scan.

Kristen was a dedicated teacher who loved chil-
1
dren. She was thrilled to become a mother. 
2
Sadly, she only experienced motherhood for a 
3
few short days. Kristen’s family members have 
4
been dedicated advocates since her passing. 
5
(D) Teresa Anne Lawrence. On December 
6
8, 1983, Teresa Anne Lawrence,a devoted 
7
mother of three, beloved wife, and staple of her 
8
community, collapsed while visiting her son’s 
9
school. She had been struggling with and taking 
10
medication for hypertension for several years. 
11
At age 34, after being unconscious for four 
12
days, she passed away as a result of a brain an-
13
eurysm. Her loving husband and extended fam-
14
ily were left to raise their children, whom Te-
15
resa cherished so much. 
16
(E) Jennifer Sedney. On December 25, 
17
2013, Jennifer Sedney, a beautiful, accom-
18
plished young woman, passed away suddenly at 
19
the age of 27 from a ruptured brain aneurysm. 
20
Her only symptom was the ‘‘worst headache of 
21
her life’’, which none of her friends or family 
22
realized was a symptom of a potentially fatal 
23
condition. Jenny was a jogger, a disciplined ex-
24
erciser, and a successful health care consultant

and had recently launched a health blog found-
1
ed on three principles—‘‘bee curious, bee radi-
2
ant, bee well’’. Her brother, mother, and father, 
3
and a large devoted network of friends and rel-
4
atives, remember her every day. 
5
(4) Brain aneurysm ruptures have a significant 
6
fiscal impact on survivors, caretakers, and the health 
7
care community. The annual estimated pre-insur-
8
ance direct cost of brain aneurysm ruptures to 
9
American patients is approximately $1,400,000,000, 
10
and the estimated direct cost to hospitals each year 
11
is approximately $2,700,000,000. The length of stay 
12
in the intensive care unit is the largest driver of cost 
13
for brain aneurysm ruptures, and estimates do not 
14
reflect indirect costs including travel, food, childcare, 
15
and wage losses for patients and caretakers. 
16
(5) Despite the widespread prevalence of this 
17
condition and the high societal cost it imposes on the 
18
Nation, the Federal Government only spends ap-
19
proximately $2.08 per year on brain aneurysm re-
20
search for each person afflicted with a brain aneu-
21
rysm.

(6) The first three iterations of the Inter-
23
national Study on Unruptured Intracranial Aneu-
24
rysms (ISUIA) have advanced researchers’ and clini-
