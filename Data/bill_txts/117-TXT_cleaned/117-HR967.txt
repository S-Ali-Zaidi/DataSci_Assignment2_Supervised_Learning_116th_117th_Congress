Whereas child bereavement disproportionately impacts minor-
ity communities; 
Whereas children losing primary caregivers have a higher risk 
of experiencing substance abuse and mental health prob-
lems, including anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic 
stress disorder; 
Whereas bereaved children are at higher risk of reduced em-
ployment and housing instability, and experience lower 
rates of academic attainment and higher dropout rates; 
Whereas parental bereavement is associated with a higher 
likelihood of risky behaviors that threaten the health and 
safety of bereaved children;
