•HR 8452 IH
(1) On June 24, 2022, in its decision in Dobbs 
1
v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the Su-
2
preme Court overruled Roe v. Wade, reversing dec-
3
ades of precedent recognizing the constitutional 
4
right to terminate a pregnancy. 
5
(2) The abortion access landscape was already 
6
strained. This decision will decimate access for mil-
7
lions of people in the United States. Roughly half of 
8
States are predicted to ban or severely restrict abor-
9
tion in the coming months. 
10
(3) The implications of this decision will fall 
11
hardest on people who already face barriers to 
12
health care access, particularly Black people, Indige-
13
nous people, and other people of color, people with 
14
disabilities, people in rural areas, young people, peo-
15
ple with documentation barriers, and those having 
16
difficulty making ends meet. 
17
(4) People have always had abortions and al-
18
ways will, even in the face of legal, financial, and 
19
logistical barriers, or criminalization. While some 
20
will self-manage their abortions, and have the option 
21
of using pills that are medically safe and effective, 
22
many others are traveling hundreds of miles out of 
23
State, or forced to carry pregnancies to term.

•HR 8452 IH
(5) Abortion funds and practical support funds 
1
are community-based organizations that support 
2
people in overcoming financial and logistical barriers 
3
to abortion care. 
4
(6) Funds work together to remove financial 
5
and logistical barriers to abortion access and have 
6
been doing this work for years. Some of these bar-
7
riers are, but are not limited to, transportation, 
8
food, lodging, childcare, translation, and doula serv-
9
ices. 
10
(7) Many funds are led by people who have had 
11
abortions themselves, including a growing base of 
12
Black and Brown leaders who have themselves faced 
13
abortion obstacles and understand the complex cir-
14
cumstances callers may face. 
15
(8) Abortion funds have a history of being 
16
underresourced and rely mostly on volunteer time 
17
and energy to support communities. 
18
(9) Abortion and practical support funds hold 
19
some of the closest ties to people who are having 
20
abortions and have the first-hand experience, up-to- 
21
date and on-the-ground knowledge, and the regional 
22
and national connections needed to support abortion 
23
seekers financially, emotionally, or logistically.

•HR 8452 IH
(10) Clinics in States where abortion is legal 
1
and more accessible are receiving an influx of people 
2
seeking abortions. Provider shortages plus this rapid 
3
increase in patients will cause longer waits for ap-
4
pointments. 
5
(11) When people are not able to access an 
6
abortion when they need it, they are often pushed 
7
much further into pregnancy. This increases costs 
8
exponentially. For many, the increased financial bur-
9
den will push abortion care completely out of reach. 
10
(12) A rapidly changing access landscape, as 
11
bans are implemented and challenged, means that 
12
the window to access care in certain States may be 
13
limited. People who are put in a position where they 
14
must postpone their care due to financial or other 
15
constraints may face appointment cancellations due 
16
to overnight changes in legality. 
17
(13) Funds often work with each other if they 
18
cannot fully assist a caller, or if a caller is traveling 
19
across regions. A national network of almost 100 
20
abortion and practical support funds has dem-
21
onstrated these funds are uniquely positioned to lead 
22
in this moment and need support.
