(b) TRANSNATIONAL REPRESSION ACCOUNTABILITY 
1
AND PREVENTION.— 
2
(1) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following 
3
findings: 
4
(A) The International Criminal Police Or-
5
ganization (INTERPOL) works to prevent and 
6
fight crime through enhanced cooperation and 
7
innovation on police and security matters, in-
8
cluding 
kleptocracy, 
counterterrorism, 
9
cybercrime, counternarcotics, and transnational 
10
organized crime. 
11
(B) United States membership and partici-
12
pation in INTERPOL advances the national se-
13
curity and law enforcement interests of the 
14
United States related to combating kleptocracy, 
15
terrorism, 
cybercrime, 
narcotics, 
and 
16
transnational organized crime. 
17
(C) Article 2 of INTERPOL’s Constitution 
18
states that the organization aims ‘‘[to] ensure 
19
and promote the widest possible mutual assist-
20
ance between all criminal police authorities . . . 
21
in the spirit of the ‘Universal Declaration of 
22
Human Rights’ ’’. 
23
(D) Article 3 of INTERPOL’s Constitu-
24
tion states that ‘‘[i]t is strictly forbidden for the 
25
04:33 Sep 11, 2021
H5209
39 
•HR 5209 IH
Organization to undertake any intervention or 
1
activities of a political, military, religious or ra-
2
cial character’’. 
3
(E) These principles provide INTERPOL 
4
with a foundation based on respect for human 
5
rights and avoidance of politically motivated ac-
6
tions by the organization and its members. 
7
(F) According to the Justice Manual of the 
8
United States Department of Justice, ‘‘[i]n the 
9
United States, national law prohibits the arrest 
10
of the subject of a Red Notice issued by an-
11
other INTERPOL member country, based upon 
12
the notice alone’’. 
13
(2) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
14
Congress that some INTERPOL member countries 
15
have repeatedly misused INTERPOL’s databases 
16
and processes, including Notice and Diffusion mech-
17
anisms, for activities of an overtly political or other 
18
unlawful character and in violation of international 
19
human rights standards, including making requests 
20
to harass or persecute political opponents, human 
21
rights defenders, or journalists.
