A BILL 
To provide for research and education with respect to uterine 
fibroids, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Stephanie Tubbs Jones

Uterine Fibroid Research and Education Act of 2021’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds as follows: 
7
(1) It is estimated that 20 percent to 50 per-
8
cent of women of reproductive age currently have 
9

•HR 2007 IH
uterine fibroids, and up to 77 percent of women will 
1
develop fibroids before menopause. 
2
(2) In the United States, an estimated 
3
26,000,000 women between the ages of 15 and 50 
4
have uterine fibroids, and approximately 15,000,000 
5
of these individuals experience symptoms. Uterine 
6
fibroids may cause significant morbidity through 
7
their presence in the uterus and pelvic cavity, and 
8
symptoms can include pelvic pain, several menstrual 
9
bleeding, iron-deficiency anemia, fatigue, bladder or 
10
bowel dysfunction, infertility, and pregnancy com-
11
plications and loss. 
12
(3) The pain, discomfort, stress, and other 
13
physical and emotional symptoms of living with 
14
fibroids may significantly interfere with a woman’s 
15
quality of life, compromising her ability to function 
16
normally or work or care for her family, and may 
17
lead to more severe health and wellness issues. 
18
(4) Most women will experience uterine fibroids 
19
by the age of 50, yet few data exist describing the 
20
overall patient experience with fibroids. 
21
(5) Many people with fibroids are likely 
22
undiagnosed. Patients wait on average 3.6 years be-
23
fore seeking treatment, and over 40 percent of pa-
24
tients see two or more health care providers prior to 
25
03:14 May 15, 2021

•HR 2007 IH
receiving a diagnosis, underscoring the need for im-
1
proved awareness and education. 
2
(6) People of color are more likely to develop 
3
uterine fibroids. It is estimated that more than 80 
4
percent of Black women and about 70 percent of 
5
white women develop fibroids by the time they reach 
6
menopause. Black individuals with fibroids have also 
7
been shown to have more severe symptoms and de-
8
velop early-onset uterine fibroids that develop into 
9
larger tumors. 
10
(7) Current research and available data do not 
11
provide adequate information on the prevalence and 
12
incidence of fibroids in Asian, Hispanic, and Black 
13
individuals. 
14
(8) Symptomatic uterine fibroids can cause re-
15
productive problems, including infertility. People 
16
with uterine fibroids are much more likely to mis-
17
carry during early pregnancy than people without 
18
them. 
19
(9) According to the Evidence Report Summary 
20
on the Management of Uterine Fibroids, as compiled 
21
by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality 
22
of the Department of Health and Human Services, 
23
there is a ‘‘remarkable lack of high-quality evidence 
24
03:14 May 15, 2021
H2007

•HR 2007 IH
supporting the effectiveness of most interventions for 
1
symptomatic fibroids’’. 
2
(10) Most medical options for managing fibroid 
3
symptoms regulate or suppress menstruation and 
4
prevent pregnancy. There is a great need for mini-
5
mally invasive, fertility-friendly therapies, as well as 
6
biomarkers, imaging assessments, or risk-based algo-
7
rithms that can help predict patient response to 
8
therapy. 
9
(11) The presence of symptomatic uterine 
10
fibroids 
is 
the 
most 
common 
reason 
for 
11
hysterectomies, 
accounting 
for 
39 
percent 
of 
12
hysterectomies annually in the United States. Ap-
13
proximately 42 per 1,000 women are hospitalized 
14
annually because of uterine fibroids, but Black pa-
15
tients 
have 
higher 
rates 
of 
hospitalization, 
16
hysterectomies, and myomectomies compared to 
17
white women. Uterine fibroids are also the leading 
18
cause of hospitalization related to a gynecological 
19
disorder. 
20
(12) The personal and societal costs of uterine 
21
fibroids in the United States are significant. Uterine 
22
fibroid tumors have been estimated to cost the 
23
United States $5,900,000,000 to $34,400,000,000 
24
annually. The annual direct costs, including surgery, 
25
03:14 May 15, 2021
H2007
5 
•HR 2007 IH
hospital admissions, outpatient visits, and medica-
1
tions, 
were 
estimated 
at 
$4,100,000,000 
to 
2
$9,400,000,000 annually. Estimated lost work-hour 
3
costs 
ranged 
from 
$1,550,000,000 
to 
4
$17,200,000,000 annually. Obstetric outcomes that 
5
were attributed to fibroid tumors resulted in costs of 
6
$238,000,000 to $7,760,000,000 annually. 
7
(13) At the federal level, uterine fibroid re-
8
search remains drastically underfunded as compared 
9
to patient disease burden. In 2019, fibroid research 
10
received about $17,000,000 in funding from the Na-
11
tional Institutes of Health, putting it in the bottom 
12
50 of 292 funded conditions.
