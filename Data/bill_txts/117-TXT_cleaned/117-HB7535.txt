A BILL 
To encourage the migration of Federal Government informa-
tion technology systems to quantum-resistant cryptog-
raphy, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Quantum Computing 
4
Cybersecurity Preparedness Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
6
(a) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Cryptography is essential for our national 
8
security and the functioning of our economy.

(2) The most widespread encryption protocols 
1
today rely on computational limits of classical com-
2
puters to provide cybersecurity. 
3
(3) Quantum computers might one day have the 
4
ability to push computational boundaries, allowing 
5
us to solve problems that have been intractable thus 
6
far, such as integer factorization, which is important 
7
for encryption. 
8
(4) The rapid progress of quantum computing 
9
suggests the potential for adversaries to steal sen-
10
sitive encrypted data today using classical com-
11
puters, and wait until sufficiently powerful quantum 
12
systems are available to decrypt it. 
13
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
14
gress that— 
15
(1) a strategy for the migration of information 
16
technology systems of the Federal Government to 
17
post-quantum cryptography is needed; and 
18
(2) the Governmentwide and industrywide ap-
19
proach 
to 
post-quantum 
cryptography 
should 
20
prioritize developing applications, hardware intellec-
21
tual property (IP), and software that can be easily 
22
updated to support developing cryptographic agility.

(1) MIGRATION TO POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOG-
1
RAPHY.—Not later than 1 year after the date on 
2
which the Director of NIST has issued post-quan-
3
tum cryptography standards, the Director of OMB, 
4
in consultation with the Chief Information Officers 
5
Council, shall begin to prioritize the migration to 
6
post-quantum cryptography and assessment of infor-
7
mation technology systems of executive agencies that 
8
does not use post-quantum cryptography, including 
9
digital signatures.

OF

FOR

11
TION.—Not later than 1 year after the date on 
12
which post-quantum cryptography standards have 
13
been set by NIST and on an ongoing basis there-
14
after, the Director of OMB, in consultation with the 
15
Chief Information Officers Council, shall designate 
16
and prioritize for migration to post-quantum cryp-
17
tography information technology systems of execu-
18
tive agencies based on the risk of systems that do 
19
not use post-quantum cryptography.

(b) REPORT ON POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHY.— 
21
Not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of 
22
this section, the Director of OMB shall submit to Congress

•HR 7535 IH
(1) A strategy to address the risk posed by the 
1
vulnerabilities of information technology systems of

executive agencies to weakened encryption due to the 
3
potential and possible capability of a quantum com-
4
puter to breach such encryption.

(2) The funding necessary to secure such infor-
6

adversarial access to quantum computers.

(3) A description and analysis of ongoing co-
9
ordination efforts, including any framework and 
10
timeline, with international standards development

12
national Organization for Standardization) to de-
13

(d) DEFINITIONS.—In this section: 
3
(1) CLASSICAL
COMPUTER.—The term ‘‘clas-
4
sical computer’’ means a device that accepts digital 
5
data and manipulates the information based on a 
6
program or sequence of instructions for how data is 
7
to be processed and encodes information in binary 
8
bits that can either be 0s or 1s. 
9
(2) DIRECTOR OF NIST.—The term ‘‘Director 
10
of NIST’’ means the Director of the National Insti-
11
tute for Standards and Technology. 
12
(3) DIRECTOR OF OMB.—The term ‘‘Director of 
13
OMB’’ means the Director of the Office of Manage-
14
ment and Budget. 
15

16
agency’’ has the meaning given the term ‘‘Executive 
17
agency’’ in section 105 of title 5, United States 
18
Code.

(5) INFORMATION
TECHNOLOGY.—The term 
20

2
tographic system that— 
3
(A) is secure against decryption attempts 
4
using a quantum computer or classical com-
5
puter; and 
6
(B) can interoperate with existing commu-
7
nications protocols and networks.

(7) QUANTUM COMPUTER.—The term ‘‘quan-
9
tum computer’’ means a device for computation that 
10
uses quantum mechanics like superposition and en-
11
tanglement to perform computational operations on
