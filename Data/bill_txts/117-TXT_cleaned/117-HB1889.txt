•HR 1889 IH
(1) Communities of color, low-income commu-
1
nities, Tribal and indigenous communities, fossil 
2
fuel-dependent communities, and other vulnerable 
3
populations, such as persons with disabilities, chil-
4
dren, and the elderly, are disproportionately bur-
5
dened by environmental hazards that include expo-
6
sure to polluted air, waterways, and landscapes. 
7
(2) Environmental justice disparities are also 
8
exhibited through a lack of equitable access to infor-
9
mation and data on potential exposure to environ-
10
mental hazards. 
11
(3) Communities experiencing environmental in-
12
justice have been subjected to systemic racial, social, 
13
and economic injustices and face a disproportionate 
14
burden of adverse human health or environmental 
15
effects, a higher risk of intentional, unconscious, and 
16
structural discrimination, and disproportionate en-
17
ergy burdens. 
18
(4) These disproportionate burdens are being 
19
exacerbated by the COVID–19 pandemic. 
20
(5) Citizen science will be essential for environ-
21
mental justice communities to protect themselves 
22
during this pandemic.
