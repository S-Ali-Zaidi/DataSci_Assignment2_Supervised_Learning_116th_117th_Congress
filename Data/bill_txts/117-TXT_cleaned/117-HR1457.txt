RESOLUTION 
Supporting the goals and ideals of ‘‘National Poppy Day’’. 
Whereas poppies are worn and displayed as a symbolic trib-
ute to fallen and future veterans and members of the 
Armed Forces; 
Whereas the use of the poppy symbolically comes from the 
poem ‘‘In Flanders Fields’’, which movingly begins, ‘‘In 
Flanders Fields the poppies blow, between the crosses, 
row on row’’, referring to the poppies that sprang up in 
the battlefields and newly dug soldiers’ graves in parts of 
Belgium and France during World War I; 
Whereas John McCrae’s poem inspired Moina Belle Michael 
of Athens, Georgia, to write her own poem entitled ‘‘We 
Shall Keep the Faith’’, in which she promised to wear a

red poppy to memorialize American soldiers killed in 
World War I; 
Whereas the American Legion family and the Veterans of 
Foreign Wars adopted the poppy as a symbol of freedom 
and the blood shed by those who have served in the 
United States Armed Forces; 
Whereas the red poppy has been worn in the United States 
for more than 80 years as a way to remember those indi-
viduals who died fighting for freedom and democracy 
around the world and to raise money to help disabled vet-
erans; 
Whereas the poppy is worn throughout the world to com-
memorate members of the Armed Forces who have died 
in the line of duty, as part of Remembrance Day, Armi-
stice Day, or Poppy Day ceremonies; 
Whereas, as the United States commemorates yearly the lives 
of Americans who gave the ultimate sacrifice of their 
lives on Memorial Day, it is fitting to attach the symbolic 
meaning of the poppy and formally recognize its historic 
symbolism; 
Whereas wearing a poppy can unite citizens from across the 
country who wish to show their patriotism and apprecia-
tion for those who serve as members of the United States 
Armed Forces; and 
Whereas the Friday before each Memorial Day is an appro-
priate day to recognize as ‘‘National Poppy Day’’: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—

(1) supports the goals and ideals of ‘‘National
