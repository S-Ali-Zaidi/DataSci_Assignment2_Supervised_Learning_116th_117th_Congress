RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the amount of the Members’ Representational Allowance 
should be increased in response to increasing threats 
against Members of the House.

congressional event in Tucson, Arizona, critically wound-
ing Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and killing a con-
gressional staff member and five members of the public; 
Whereas, on June 14, 2017, a gunman with a rifle and side-
arm opened fire on at least seventeen Members of Con-

Whereas, in a hearing on July 16, 2019, Capitol Police Chief 
Steven Sund stated that threats against Members of Con-
gress are increasing at a record pace; 
Whereas, on January 6, 2021, a violent assault took place at 
the United States Capitol; 
Whereas the Capitol was on lockdown while Members of Con-
gress were forced to barricade doors and hide under 
desks in credible fear for their lives; 
Whereas law enforcement agents later discovered weapons 
and explosive devices on the Capitol Grounds; 
Whereas four civilians and Capitol Police Officer Brian D. 
Sicknick died from injuries sustained during the Capitol 
assault, and Officer Howard Liebengood died off-duty 
shortly after responding to the Capitol assault; 
Whereas, since the events of January 6, 2021, several Mem-
bers of Congress have faced heightened threats and har-
assment while traveling through airports; and 
Whereas every Member of the House of Representatives is in 
dire need of additional security in response to these in-
creased threats to the public, themselves, their families, 
and their staff: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-
