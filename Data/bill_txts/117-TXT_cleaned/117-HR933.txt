RESOLUTION 
Supporting the goals and ideals of National Engineers Week. 
Whereas engineers employ their scientific knowledge and ana-
lytical skills for the betterment of the United States and 
for the protection of the public health, safety, and wel-
fare; 
Whereas the mission of DiscoverE (formerly the National En-
gineers Week Foundation) is to sustain and grow a dy-
namic engineering profession through outreach, edu-
cation, celebration, and volunteerism as needed to keep

the United States a global leader in engineering and en-
gineering education; 
Whereas the sponsors of National Engineers Week are work-
ing together to transform the engineering workforce 
through greater inclusion of women and underrepresented 
communities in the science, technology, engineering, and 
mathematics (STEM) fields; 
Whereas, by engaging young students, parents, and educators 
in hands-on STEM activities, engineers help them dis-
cover how they can make a meaningful difference in the 
world; 
Whereas the partnership between engineers and teachers in-
spires future generations of engineering and technology 
talent; 
Whereas tens of thousands of engineers and engineering stu-
dents will serve their communities not only through their 
work but, at this time of year, by reaching into hundreds 
of local communities; 
Whereas the perspective and technical expertise of engineers 
is vital to solving today’s most pressing global chal-
lenges—including infrastructure, national security, and 
environmental sustainability—and the professional engi-
neer’s commitment to high ethical standards is necessary 
for the protection of public health, safety, and welfare; 
Whereas ‘‘science creates more opportunity for the next gen-
eration’’, according to the National Science Board’s 2018 
Science and Engineering Indicators; 
Whereas engineers are a crucial link in research, develop-
ment, and the transformation of scientific discoveries into 
useful products and jobs, as the people of the United 
States look more than ever to engineers and their imagi-

nation, knowledge, and analytical skills to meet the chal-
lenges of the future; 
Whereas the National Science Board’s 2018 Science and En-
gineering Indicators show that the number of students 
obtaining engineering bachelor’s degrees in the United 
States has increased steadily for the last 15 years for 
which data are available, yet the rates for women do not 
reflect our national demographics, with only 20 percent 
of bachelor’s degrees in engineering being earned by 
women; 
Whereas the National Science Board’s ‘‘Science and Engi-
neering Indicators 2020’’ shows that historically under-
represented racial and ethnic groups, particularly Black 
and Hispanic populations, ‘‘remain underrepresented in 
the [science & engineering (S&E)] workforce relative to 
their overall presence in the workforce and the popu-
lation’’; 
Whereas the National Science Foundation’s National Center 
for Science and Engineering Statistics report on 
‘‘Women, Minorities, and Persons with Disabilities in 
Science and Engineering 2017’’ shows that women are 
closing the gap with men in S&E educational attainment 
but are still underrepresented in S&E occupations; 
Whereas only around 4 percent of the Nation’s workforce is 
comprised of scientists and engineers, yet this group dis-
proportionately creates jobs for the other 96 percent; 
Whereas DiscoverE has grown into a formal coalition of more 
than 100 professional societies, major corporations, and 
government agencies that serves as a hub of engineering 
outreach dedicated to ensuring a diverse and well-edu-
cated engineering workforce, promoting literacy in

science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, and 
raising public awareness and appreciation of the con-
tributions of engineers to society; 
Whereas Congress has recognized National Engineers Week 
every year since 1951; and 
Whereas February 20, 2022, through February 26, 2022, has 
been designated as National Engineers Week by 
DiscoverE and the theme is ‘‘Reimagining the Possible’’, 
recognizing how engineers continuously create new possi-
bilities, from green buildings, to fuel-efficient cars, to life- 
saving vaccines, and how engineers work together to de-
velop new technologies, products, and opportunities that 
change how we live and inspire the next generation: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the goals and ideals of National 
2
Engineers Week to increase understanding of and

interest in engineering and technology careers and to

promote technological literacy and engineering edu-

cation; 
6
(2) recognizes that engineering education is a 
7
critical component of STEM (science, technology,

engineering, and mathematics) education and essen-

tial to improving the United States educational sys-
10
tem and economic prosperity; and
