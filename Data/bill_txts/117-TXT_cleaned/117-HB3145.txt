To require Executive agency review of occupational licensing 
requirements, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Freedom to Work 
4
Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 3145 IH
(1) Occupational licensing has grown exponen-
1
tially, comprising nearly 25 percent of the United 
2
States workforce today, up from 5 percent nearly 60 
3
years ago. 
4
(2) According to a 2018 Bureau of Labor Sta-
5
tistics survey, 84.4 percent of employed people with 
6
a certification or license responded that their creden-
7
tial was required for their job. 
8
(3) Studies show little evidence that licensing 
9
improves quality of services and instead costs con-
10
sumers $203,000,000,000 annually, reduces the 
11
number of jobs by 2,850,000, with the most impact 
12
on low-income workers seeking to enter occupations 
13
for the first time. 
14
(4) Occupations experience slower employment 
15
growth in States where they are licensed, compared 
16
to States where they are not, proving occupational li-
17
censing serves as a barrier to employment. 
18
(5) Enacted into Federal law in 2014, the stat-
19
ed purpose of the Workforce Innovation and Oppor-
20
tunity Act (29 U.S.C. 3101 et seq.) is to strengthen 
21
the United States workforce development system 
22
through innovation in, and alignment and improve-
23
ment of, employment, training, and education pro-

grams in the United States, and to promote indi-
1
vidual and national economic growth. 
2
(6) In fiscal year 2021, Congress appropriated 
3
$2,845,332,000 for States to assist Americans in 
4
overcoming barriers to employment and help employ-
5
ers hire and retain workers. 
6
(7) If States enact unnecessary occupational li-
7
censing requirements that create barriers for indi-
8
vidual job seekers, when no requirement or a less re-
9
strictive alternative may serve the same purpose, 
10
States are acting in contradiction to the goals of 
11
Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (29 
12
U.S.C. 3101 et seq.). 
13
(8) On December 14, 2020, the Executive Of-
14
fice of the President published Executive Order 
15
13966, Increasing Economic and Geographic Mobil-
16
ity to establish it as the policy of the United States 
17
to alleviate unnecessary regulatory burdens on the 
18
American people and require the Federal Govern-
19
ment to review and report on authorities, regula-
20
tions, guidance, and policies to alleviate such occupa-
21
tional licensing burdens. 
22
(9) Policymakers at all levels of government 
23
should require evidence to determine if there is a 
24
demonstrated need to regulate an occupation and 
25

should consider a range of less restrictive alter-

natives such as, quality ratings, voluntary third-

party professional certifications, bonding or insur-
3
ance, or inspection requirements.
