tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Blockchain or distributed ledger technology 
3
allows computers connected by a peer-to-peer net-
4
work to reach agreement over a shared ledger of 
5
data. Changes to the shared ledger can only be ef-
6
fected if the majority of the computers in the net-
7
work verify the validity of the change and agree to 
8
its inclusion in the ledger. 
9
(2) The Connected Commerce Council found 
10
that 72 percent of small businesses increased their 
11
use of digital tools during the COVID–19 crisis, and 
12
48 percent utilized a new digital tool. 
13
(3) As small businesses increasingly move their 
14
operations online, it is critical that any and all infor-
15
mation relevant to the business is protected and se-
16
cure. Blockchain technology is an additional tool 
17
that small businesses can leverage to ensure that the 
18
operation is adequately protected from cyberattack. 
19
(4) Blockchains are decentralized and distrib-
20
uted across peer-to-peer networks that are contin-
21
ually updated and kept in sync. Because these net-
22
works are not contained in a central location, they 
23
do not have a single point of failure and cannot be 
24
changed from a single computer operating within the 
25
network. These features of blockchain technology

make stealing data or engaging in fraud significantly 
1
more difficult. 
2
(5) Blockchain technology has the ability to bol-
3
ster trust and efficiency. All participants in the 
4
blockchain networks have access to the same infor-
5
mation, which is not only immutable but also up-
6
dated in real time, which means that information 
7
sharing and verification is streamlined and accessible 
8
to all relevant parties.
