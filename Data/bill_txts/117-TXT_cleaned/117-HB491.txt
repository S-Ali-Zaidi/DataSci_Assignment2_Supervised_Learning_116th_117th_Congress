SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds that— 
2
(1) the New River was born out of the Colorado 
3
River’s occasional flows into the Salton Sink and the 
4
erosion of the New River channel which formed the 
5
deep river canyon between 1905 and 1907; 
6
(2) the New River starts in Mexicali, Mexico, 
7
flows north into the United States through Calexico, 
8
passes through the Imperial Valley and drains into 
9
the Salton Sea, roughly 66 miles north of the inter-
10
national boundary, and the sub-watershed covers ap-
11
proximately 750 square miles, with 63 percent of 
12
that in Mexico and 37 percent in the United States; 
13
(3) the New River has been widely recognized 
14
for its significant water pollution problems, pri-
15
marily because of agricultural runoff, raw sewage, 
16
pesticides, and discharges of wastes from domestic, 
17
agricultural, and industrial sources in Mexico and 
18
the Imperial Valley; 
19
(4) by the 1980s, the New River acquired the 
20
reputation of being one of the most polluted rivers 
21
in the United States, with many of the pollutants 
22
posing serious human health hazards to local popu-
23
lations, particularly those in Calexico and Mexicali; 
24
(5) in 1992, the International Boundary Water 
25
Commission’s Treaty Minute No. 288 established a

sanitation strategy for the New River water quality 
1
problems at the international boundary and divided 
2
the sanitation projects into two immediate repairs 
3
projects, the Mexicali I and the Mexicali II, which 
4
totaled about $50 million dollars and were funded by 
5
both countries through the North American Develop-
6
ment Bank; 
7
(6) in 1995, the Environmental Protection 
8
Agency provided funds to the California Regional 
9
Water Quality Control Board to monitor and docu-
10
ment the water quality at the international boundary 
11
on a monthly basis; 
12
(7) in the late 1990s, the United States and 
13
Mexico spent $100 million (45 percent paid by Mex-
14
ico and 55 percent paid by the United States) to 
15
build the Las Arenitas and Zaragoza Wastewater 
16
Treatment plants, and untreated New River water 
17
passing through four microbial treatment cells at 
18
Las Arenitas was then chlorinated and fed into a re- 
19
forestation project along the desiccated Rio Hardy 
20
which stretches to the Sea of Cortez; 
21
(8) a 10-year effort by community groups, law-
22
yers, regulatory agencies, and politicians addressed 
23
the problem at the source by federally funding a new

sewage treatment plant in Mexicali and developing a 
1
site plan for the river on the United States side; 
2
(9) in 2009, the State of California required the 
3
California-Mexico Border Relations Council to create 
4
a strategic plan to study, monitor, remediate, and 
5
enhance the New River’s water quality to protect 
6
human health and develop a river parkway suitable 
7
for public use; 
8
(10) in 2012, the California-Mexico Border Re-
9
lations Council approved the strategic plan for the 
10
New River Improvement Project prepared by the 
11
New River Improvement Project Technical Advisory 
12
Committee; 
13
(11) in 2016, the New River Improvement 
14
Project Technical Advisory Committee revised the 
15
recommended infrastructure of the New River Im-
16
provement Project, and the State of California ap-
17
propriated $1.4 million to provide grants or con-
18
tracts to implement the necessary planning, design, 
19
environmental review, and permitting work; 
20
(12) the revised New River Improvement 
21
Project includes the installation of a large trash 
22
screen, a conveyance system, aeration devices, a new 
23
pump station and managed wetlands; and
