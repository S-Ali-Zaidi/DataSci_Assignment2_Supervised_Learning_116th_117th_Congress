To amend the Clean Air Act to eliminate the corn ethanol 
mandate for renewable fuel. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Food before Fuel Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
5
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) Ukraine accounts for 16 percent of global 
7
corn exports and 12 percent of wheat exports. 
8
(2) The United States could more than com-
9
pensate for the loss of Ukraine’s exports by divert-

ing crops that are to be made into biofuels into food 
1
production instead. 
2
(3) Almost 70 percent of all United States 
3
grain production is corn, but almost half is formu-
4
lated into ethanol to drive cars and trucks. 
5
(4) Converting corn into fuel happens only be-
6
cause of a mass of Federal regulations and subsidies 
7
that began during the Carter administration. 
8
(5) While ethanol may have small environ-
9
mental advantages over gasoline, the benefits are 
10
nullified by ethanol’s toll on world food output. 
11
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
12
gress that the Federal Government should not be 
13
incentivizing farmers to grow corn for ethanol while Rus-
14
sia’s invasion of Ukraine is jeopardizing the lives of 
15
Ukraine’s citizens and is on track to cause a severe mal-
16
nutrition across the world. As this supply is cut off, food 
17
prices which are already at record levels, will increase at 
18
a time when the economic fallout from the pandemic is 
19
already harming household budgets, particularly in low- 
20
income countries.
