encouraging President Biden to make the resolution of 
the Cyprus problem a top foreign policy priority.

tion (NATO) member since 1952 and is thus a treaty 
ally of the United States; 
Whereas modern Turkey was founded upon the principles of 
republicanism and laı¨cite´; 
Whereas Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the au-
thoritarian leader of Turkey since 2003, has grounded

Whereas under President Erdogan, Turkey seeks to establish 
itself as the hegemon of the Eastern Mediterranean, 
North Africa, and the Caucuses, and as a result has 
taken provocative actions toward NATO allies, the Euro-
pean Union, and the broader region; 
Whereas President Erdogan’s expansionist political ideology 
necessitates aggression toward Cyprus; 
Whereas the Government of Turkey ordered its military to in-
vade the Republic of Cyprus in 1974 in violation of the 
Treaty of Establishment, the Treaty of Alliance, the 
North Atlantic Treaty, and the Treaty of Guarantee, 
which established the Republic of Cyprus and guaranteed 
the independence of the Republic of Cyprus, as well as 
the United Nations Charter and customary international 
law; 
Whereas the Government of Turkey has tolerated or abetted 
the desecration of more than 500 Orthodox Christian 
churches and religious sites in the territory of the Repub-
lic of Cyprus that the Turkish military occupies; 
Whereas the Government of Turkey has brought in over 
200,000 illegal settlers into the occupied area of Cyprus 
to change the sociopolitical and demographic fabric of the 
area, in violation of the Geneva Conventions; 
Whereas Turkey is a member state of the European Court 
of Human Rights (ECHR); 
Whereas the ECHR has issued decisions and judgments in 
which the Court confirms that persons, including United 
States citizens, who hold title to real property located in 
the area of the Republic of Cyprus occupied by the Turk-
ish military are the only rightful owners of that real

property, but Turkey has refused to comply with the 
ECHR judgment; 
Whereas despite having agreed to do so, the Government of 
Turkey has failed to support international efforts to find 
and identify the remains of persons, including four 
United States citizens who remain missing since the 
Turkish invasion of the Republic of Cyprus in 1974; 
Whereas Turkey illegally violates Cyprus Exclusive Economic 
Zones; 
Whereas President Erdogan has illegally reopened the beach 
in Varosha, a once-thriving tourist town which the Turk-
ish military ethnically cleansed of its Greek Cypriot popu-
lation in 1974; 
Whereas President Erdogan has openly called for a ‘‘two- 
state’’ solution regarding Cyprus, in violation of United 
Nations resolutions, international law, and the position of 
the United States Government, which is that a Cyprus 
solution should be within the framework of a bizonal, 
bicommunal federation; and 
Whereas in a January 27, 1989, letter to a prominent Greek- 
American leader from Delaware, Dr. Dean Lomis, then- 
Senator Biden stated: ‘‘. . . we must urge the new Ad-
ministration [President George H.W. Bush] to make Cy-
prus a higher policy priority in American foreign policy 
. . . we cannot lose sight of the fact that the rights of 
Greek Cypriots have been trampled upon, and we must 
ensure that their claims to ancestral land and property 
seized during the 1974 invasion are not compromised. Fi-
nally, we must send a signal to Turkey that until it has 
removed every last soldier from Cyprus, it will never be
