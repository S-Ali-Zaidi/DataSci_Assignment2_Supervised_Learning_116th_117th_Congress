RESOLUTION 
Expressing support of the designation of May 18, 2021, 
as ‘‘CASA/GAL Volunteers’ Day’’. 
Whereas Court Appointed Special Advocate (referred to this 
preamble as ‘‘CASA’’) and Guardian ad Litem (referred 
to in this preamble as ‘‘GAL’’) volunteers are trained and 
qualified to advocate nationwide for the best interests of 
children before courts in cases with allegations of abuse 
or neglect; 
Whereas more than 424,000 children in the United States 
enter the foster care system, through no fault of their 
own, due to allegations of abuse or neglect and rely on 
adults to advocate on their behalf;

Whereas children of color are more likely to stay in the foster 
care system for longer periods of time and are less likely 
to be reunited with their biological families; 
Whereas CASA and GAL volunteers, appointed by a judge— 
(1) provide the court with the comprehensive and ob-
jective information the court needs to make the most 
well-informed decisions and help ensure positive outcomes 
for children and youth; and 
(2) take time to build meaningful and authentic re-
lationships with such children and youth; 
Whereas CASA and GAL communities across the country re-
main committed to the recruitment and retention of vol-
unteers who reflect the diversity of the children they 
serve; 
Whereas research shows that when a caring and consistent 
adult like a CASA or GAL volunteer is assigned to a 
case, outcomes are strengthened for children and fami-
lies, a higher number of services are ordered, and chil-
dren are significantly less likely to reenter the child wel-
fare system, perform better academically and behavior-
ally, and have higher levels of hope; 
Whereas, in January 1974, Congress enacted the Child Abuse 
Prevention Treatment Act (42 U.S.C. 5101 et seq.); 
Whereas the Child Abuse Prevention Treatment Act provides 
financial assistance to States for the prevention and 
treatment of child abuse and neglect and includes a re-
quirement that in every case a GAL must be appointed 
to represent the best interest of the child; 
Whereas such GAL requirement was subsequently amended 
to provide that the GAL may be an attorney or a court- 
appointed special advocate; and

•HRES 412 IH 
Whereas, today, CASA and GAL volunteers span 49 States 
and the District of Columbia, including 948 State organi-
zations and local programs, and more than 96,000 volun-
teers offer their services to nearly 277,000 children, 
youth, and families: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) expresses support for the designation of 
2
‘‘National CASA/GAL Volunteers’ Day’’; and 
3
(2) commends and celebrates CASA and GAL 
4
volunteers for their dedication and hard work in ad-
5
vocating for the best interest of children so that 
6
every child who has experienced abuse or neglect can 
7
be safe, have a permanent home, and have the op-
8
portunity to thrive.
