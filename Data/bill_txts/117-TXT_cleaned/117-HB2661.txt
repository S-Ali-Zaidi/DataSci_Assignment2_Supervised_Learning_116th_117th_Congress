(1) The environmental health workforce is vital 
1
to protecting the health and safety of the public. 
2
(2) For years, State and local governmental 
3
public health agencies have reported substantial 
4
workforce losses and other challenges to the environ-
5
mental health workforce. 
6
(3) According to the Association of State and 
7
Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO) and the Na-
8
tional Association of County and City Health Offi-
9
cials (NACCHO), more than 50,600 State and local 
10
environmental health workforce jobs have been lost 
11
since 2008. This represents approximately 22 per-
12
cent of the total State and local environmental 
13
health workforce. 
14
(4) In the coming years, the retiring Baby 
15
Boomer Generation will lead to a further decrease in 
16
the environmental health workforce. 
17
(5) According to the National Environmental 
18
Health Association, more than 67 percent of Tribal 
19
environmental health programs, 64 percent of State 
20
environmental health programs, and 60 percent of 
21
local environmental health programs report insuffi-
22
cient staffing capacity to respond to new issues pre-
23
sented by the COVID–19 pandemic. Industry work-

ers also reported insufficient access to training and 
1
high levels of burnout. 
2
(6) Currently, only 27 States require a creden-
3
tial for environmental health workers that is an im-
4
partial, third-party endorsement of an individual’s 
5
professional knowledge and experience. 
6
(7) Educating and training existing and new 
7
environmental health professionals should be a na-
8
tional public health goal.
