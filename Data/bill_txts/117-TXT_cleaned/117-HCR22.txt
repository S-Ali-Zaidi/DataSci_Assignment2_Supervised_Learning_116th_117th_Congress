ings, necessitate that it be nonpartisan, straightforward,

Whereas Honore´ prejudicially condemned officers of the 
United States Capitol Police by tweeting on January 6,

is [sic] responsible for this. They knew this was coming. 
They let people in. They gave them hours to voluntarily 
decide to leave.’’;

P[olice]’’; 
Whereas Honore´ prejudicially condemned officers of the 
United States Capitol Police and the House and Senate 
Sergeant at Arms by tweeting on January 6, 2021, ‘‘po-
lice underestimated the violent crowd’’ because they were 
‘‘white and pro-Trump’’ and ‘‘Capitol Police and the Ser-
geant at Arms in the House and Senate may have been 
complicit in aiding and abetting the Capitol riots’’; 
Whereas Honore´ endorsed via the social media platform Twit-
ter (tweeted) on January 6 and 7 the notion that Presi-
dent ‘‘[T]rump’s minions were installed at the Depart-
ment of Defense to help him in his seditious coup’’ and

ago. It appears he knew this was coming on December 
19 at the latest—and was prepared for it’’ and ‘‘they left 
the Capitol Police undermanned and without the right 
equipment to deal with a violent mob.’’;
