A BILL 
To establish a new Directorate for Technology and Innova-
tion in the National Science Foundation, to establish 
a regional technology hub program, to require a strategy 
and report on economic security, science, research, inno-
vation, manufacturing, and job creation, to establish a 
critical supply chain resiliency program, and for other 
purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Endless Frontier Act’’. 
2
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
3
Congress finds the following: 
4
(1) For over 70 years, the United States has 
5
been the unequivocal global leader in scientific and 
6
technological innovation, and as a result the people 
7
of the United States have benefitted through good- 
8
paying jobs, economic prosperity, and a higher qual-
9
ity of life. 
10
(A) Today, however, this leadership posi-
11
tion is being eroded and challenged by foreign 
12
competitors, some of which are stealing intellec-
13
tual property and trade secrets of the United 
14
States and aggressively investing in research 
15
and commercialization to dominate the key ex-
16
isting and future technology fields. 
17
(B) While the United States once led the 
18
world in the share of our economy invested in 
19
research, our Nation now ranks 9th globally in 
20
total research and development and 12th in 
21
publicly financed research and development. 
22
(C) While wages for American workers 
23
rose in parallel with growth in national produc-
24
tivity from the end of World War II through 
25
most of the 1970s, since then wage growth has 
26
22:50 Jun 01, 2021
H2731
3 
•HR 2731 IH
been uneven and labor’s share in national in-
1
come has declined. 
2
(2) Without a significant increase in investment 
3
in research, education, technology transfer, intellec-
4
tual property, manufacturing, and other core 
5
strengths of the United States innovation ecosystem, 
6
it is only a matter of time before the global competi-
7
tors of the United States overtake the United States 
8
in terms of technological primacy. The country that 
9
wins the race in key technologies—such as artificial 
10
intelligence, quantum computing, advanced commu-
11
nications, and advanced manufacturing—and uses 
12
technological innovation to support high-quality jobs 
13
and incomes will be the superpower of the future. 
14
(3) The Federal Government must catalyze 
15
United States innovation by boosting research in-
16
vestments focused on discovering, creating, commer-
17
cializing, and demonstrating new technologies and 
18
manufacturing 
those 
technologies 
domestically 
19
throughout the country to ensure the leadership of 
20
the United States in the industries of the future. 
21
(4) The distribution of innovation jobs and in-
22
vestment in the United States has become largely 
23
concentrated in just a few locations, while much of 
24
the Nation has been left out of growth in the innova-
25

•HR 2731 IH
tion sector. More than 90 percent of the Nation’s in-
1
novation sector employment growth in the last 15 
2
years was generated in just 5 major metropolitan 
3
areas. The Federal Government must address this 
4
imbalance in opportunity by— 
5
(A) dramatically increasing funding for 
6
science and engineering research and expanding 
7
partnerships with the private sector to build 
8
new technology hubs across the country; 
9
(B) spreading high-quality innovation sec-
10
tor jobs more broadly; 
11
(C) increasing the participation of under-
12
represented populations, engaging workers, and 
13
collaborating with labor organizations in inno-
14
vation efforts to tap the talent and potential of 
15
the entire Nation to ensure the United States 
16
leads the industries of the future; and 
17
(D) building regional capacity in such crit-
18
ical areas as entrepreneurship, access to capital 
19
and other investment, and supply chain develop-
20
ment. 
21
(5) As President Franklin D. Roosevelt stated, 
22
‘‘[N]ew frontiers of the mind are before us, and if 
23
they are pioneered with the same vision, boldness, 
24
and drive with which we have waged this war we can 
25
22:50 Jun 01, 2021
H2731
5 
•HR 2731 IH
create a fuller and more fruitful employment and a 
1
fuller and more fruitful life.’’ 
2
(6) As Vannevar Bush stated in his 1945 re-
3
port entitled Science, The Endless Frontier, ‘‘New 
4
products, new industries, and more jobs require con-
5
tinuous additions to knowledge of the laws of nature, 
6
and the application of that knowledge to practical 
7
purposes. Similarly, our defense against aggression 
8
demands new knowledge so that we can develop new 
9
and improved weapons. This essential, new knowl-
10
edge can be obtained only through basic scientific re-
11
search.’’ 
12
(7) Since their inception, the National Science 
13
Foundation and other key Federal agencies, like the 
14
Department of Energy, have carried out vital work 
15
supporting basic and applied research to create 
16
knowledge that is a key driver of the economy of the 
17
United States and enhances the Nation’s security.
