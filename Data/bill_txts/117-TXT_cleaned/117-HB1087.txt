rectly influence the election of candidates and sup-
1
port or oppose political causes; 
2
(2) decisions to use corporate funds for political 
3
contributions and expenditures are usually made by 
4
corporate boards and executives, rather than share-
5
holders; 
6
(3) corporations, acting through boards and ex-
7
ecutives, are obligated to conduct business for the 
8
best interests of their owners, the shareholders; 
9

10
way to know, or to influence, the political activities 
11
of corporations they own; 
12
(5) shareholders and the public have a right to 
13
know how corporate managers are spending com-
14
pany funds to make political contributions and ex-
15
penditures benefitting candidates, political parties, 
16
and political causes; and 
17
(6) corporations should be accountable to share-
18
holders in making political contributions or expendi-
19
tures affecting Federal governance and public policy.
