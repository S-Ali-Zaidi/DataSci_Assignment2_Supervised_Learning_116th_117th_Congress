A BILL 
To amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide 
for coverage of cancer care planning and coordination 
under the Medicare program. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
(a) SHORT TITLE.—This Act may be cited as the 
4
‘‘Cancer Care Planning and Communications Act of 
5
2021’’. 
6
(b) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following find-

ings:

•HR 4414 IH
(1) Cancer care in the United States is often 
1
described as the best in the world because patients 
2
have access to many treatment options, including 
3
cutting-edge therapies that save lives and improve 
4
the quality of life. 
5
(2) Access to the best treatment options is not 
6
equal across all populations and in all communities. 
7
The 1999 Institute of Medicine report entitled ‘‘The 
8
Unequal Burden of Cancer’’ found that low-income 
9
people often lack access to adequate cancer care and 
10
that ethnic minorities have not benefitted fully from 
11
cancer treatment advances. 
12
(3) In addition, despite access to high-quality 
13
treatment options for many, individuals with cancer 
14
often do not have access to a cancer care system 
15
that incorporates shared decision making and the co-
16
ordination of all elements of care. 
17
(4) Cancer survivors often experience the 
18
under-diagnosis and under-treatment of the symp-
19
toms of cancer and side effects of cancer treatment, 
20
a problem that begins at the time of diagnosis and 
21
may become more severe with disease progression 
22
and at the end of life. The failure to treat the symp-
23
toms, side effects, and late effects of cancer and can-
24
cer treatment may have a serious adverse impact on 
25
04:13 Jul 27, 2021
H4414

•HR 4414 IH
the health, survival, well-being, and quality of life of 
1
cancer survivors. 
2
(5) Individuals with cancer often do not partici-
3
pate in a shared decision-making process that con-
4
siders all treatment options and do not benefit from 
5
coordination of all elements of active treatment and 
6
palliative care. 
7
(6) Quality cancer care should incorporate ac-
8
cess to psychosocial services and management of the 
9
symptoms of cancer and the symptoms of cancer 
10
treatment, including pain, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, 
11
and depression. 
12
(7) Quality cancer care should include a means 
13
for engaging cancer survivors in a shared decision- 
14
making process that produces a comprehensive care 
15
summary and a plan for follow-up care after primary 
16
treatment to ensure that cancer survivors have ac-
17
cess to follow-up monitoring and treatment of pos-
18
sible late effects of cancer and cancer treatment, in-
19
cluding appropriate psychosocial services. 
20
(8) The Institute of Medicine report entitled 
21
‘‘Ensuring Quality Cancer Care’’ described the ele-
22
ments of quality care for an individual with cancer 
23
to include—

•HR 4414 IH
(A) the development of initial treatment 
1
recommendations by an experienced health care 
2
provider; 
3
(B) the development of a plan for the 
4
course of treatment of the individual and com-
5
munication of the plan to the individual; 
6
(C) access to the resources necessary to 
7
implement the course of treatment; 
8
(D) access to high-quality clinical trials; 
9
(E) a mechanism to coordinate services for 
10
the treatment of the individual; and 
11
(F) psychosocial support services and com-
12
passionate care for the individual. 
13
(9) In its report ‘‘From Cancer Patient to Can-
14
cer Survivor: Lost in Transition’’, the Institute of 
15
Medicine recommended that individuals with cancer 
16
completing primary treatment be provided a com-
17
prehensive summary of their care along with a fol-
18
low-up survivorship plan of treatment. 
19
(10) In ‘‘Cancer Care for the Whole Patient’’, 
20
the Institute of Medicine stated that the develop-
21
ment of a plan that includes biomedical and psycho-
22
social care should be a standard for quality cancer 
23
care in any quality measurement system.

•HR 4414 IH
(11) The Commission on Cancer has encour-
1
aged survivorship care planning by making the de-
2
velopment of such plans for patients one of the 
3
standards of accreditation for cancer care providers, 
4
but cancer care professionals report difficulties com-
5
pleting the plans. 
6
(12) Because more than half of all cancer diag-
7
noses occur among elderly Medicare beneficiaries, 
8
addressing cancer care inadequacies through Medi-
9
care reforms will provide benefits to millions of 
10
Americans. Providing Medicare beneficiaries more 
11
routine access to cancer care plans and survivorship 
12
care plans is a key to shared decision making and 
13
better coordination of care. 
14
(13) Important payment and delivery reforms 
15
that incorporate cancer care planning and coordina-
16
tion are already being tested in the Medicare pro-
17
gram; the Oncology Care Model has been imple-
18
mented in a number of oncology practices, and addi-
19
tional models that will include care planning have 
20
been proposed. 
21
(14) The alternative payment models, including 
22
the Oncology Care Model, provide access to cancer 
23
care planning for Medicare beneficiaries who receive 
24
their cancer care in practices that are part of the 
25
04:13 Jul 27, 2021

•HR 4414 IH
Oncology Care Model. Other Medicare beneficiaries 
1
who are not enrolled in these delivery demonstra-
2
tions may not have access to a cancer care plan or 
3
appropriate care coordination. 
4
(15) The failure to provide a cancer care plan 
5
to patients in many care settings relates in part to 
6
inadequate Medicare payment for such planning and 
7
coordination services. 
8
(16) Changes in Medicare payment for cancer 
9
care planning and coordination will support shared 
10
decision making that reviews all treatment options 
11
and will contribute to improved care for individuals 
12
with cancer from the time of diagnosis through the 
13
end of the life. Medicare payment for cancer care 
14
planning may begin a reform process that helps us 
15
realize the well-planned and well-coordinated cancer 
16
care that has been recommended by the Institute of 
17
Medicine/National Academy of Medicine and that is 
18
preferred by cancer patients across the Nation.
