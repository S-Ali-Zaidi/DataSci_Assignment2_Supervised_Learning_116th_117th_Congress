heroism in military operations against an opposing 
1
armed force as Aircraft Commander of a CH–3E 
2
helicopter of the 21st Special Operations Squadron, 
3
56th Special Operations Wing, Nakhon Phanom 
4
Royal Thai Air Base, Thailand, in action in Laos on 
5
October 6, 1969. 
6
(2) The military referred to Laos as ‘‘a classi-
7
fied location in Southeast Asia’’ until decades after 
8
the Vietnam War ended when the role of the United 
9
States in Laos was declassified. 
10
(3) While attempting to rescue the crew of a 
11
downed helicopter, Major Conran’s aircraft was hit 
12
by intense hostile ground fire, yet despite the hostile 
13
ground fire, Major Conran continued the rescue op-
14
eration and landed in the vicinity of the downed 
15
crewmen. 
16
(4) Once on the ground, he successfully evacu-
17
ated his aircraft and assumed a major role in de-
18
fending the crash site against an overwhelming hos-
19
tile force until rescue was possible six hours later. 
20
(5) Major Conran repeatedly exposed himself to 
21
heavy barrages of enemy automatic weapons fire to 
22
extract essential equipment from the downed heli-
23
copters.

(6) In spite of receiving a severe leg wound 
1
while exposed to enemy fire and trying to strengthen 
2
their position, Major Conran continued to encourage 
3
the others and did not mention his wound until he 
4
had lost all feeling in his leg. 
5
(7) Major Conran’s decision to come to the aid 
6
of his downed comrades, his heroic actions above 
7
and beyond the call of duty while under severe hos-
8
tile fire, and his positive attitude throughout the or-
9
deal were instrumental in enabling the two heli-
10
copter crews and 44 friendly troops to withstand su-
11
perior odds until a rescue could be made. 
12
(b) AUTHORIZATION.—Notwithstanding the time lim-
13
itations specified in section 9274 of title 10, United States 
14
Code, or any other time limitation with respect to the 
15
awarding of certain medals to persons who served in the 
16
Armed Forces, the President is authorized to award the 
17
Medal of Honor under section 9271 of such title to retired 
18
Colonel Philip J. Conran Air Force for the acts of valor
