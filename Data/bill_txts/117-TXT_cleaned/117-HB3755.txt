A BILL 
To protect a person’s ability to determine whether to con-
tinue or end a pregnancy, and to protect a health care 
provider’s ability to provide abortion services. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Women’s Health Pro-
4
tection Act of 2021’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. 
6
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Abortion services are essential to health 
8
care and access to those services is central to peo-
9
ple’s ability to participate equally in the economic 
10
and social life of the United States. Abortion access 
11
allows people who are pregnant to make their own 
12

decisions about their pregnancies, their families, and 
1
their lives. 
2
(2) Since 1973, the Supreme Court repeatedly 
3
has recognized the constitutional right to terminate 
4
a pregnancy before fetal viability, and to terminate 
5
a pregnancy after fetal viability where it is nec-
6
essary, in the good-faith medical judgment of the 
7
treating health care professional, for the preserva-
8
tion of the life or health of the person who is preg-
9
nant. 
10
(3) Nonetheless, access to abortion services has 
11
been obstructed across the United States in various 
12
ways, including blockades of health care facilities 
13
and associated violence, prohibitions of, and restric-
14
tions on, insurance coverage; parental involvement 
15
laws (notification and consent); restrictions that 
16
shame and stigmatize people seeking abortion serv-
17
ices; and medically unnecessary regulations that nei-
18
ther confer any health benefit nor further the safety 
19
of abortion services, but which harm people by de-
20
laying, complicating access to, and reducing the 
21
availability of, abortion services. 
22
(4) Reproductive justice requires every indi-
23
vidual to have the right to make their own decisions 
24
about having children regardless of their cir-
25
03:21 Jul 13, 2021

•HR 3755 IH
cumstances and without interference and discrimina-
1
tion. Reproductive Justice is a human right that can 
2
and will be achieved when all people, regardless of 
3
actual or perceived race, color, national origin, immi-
4
gration status, sex (including gender identity, sex 
5
stereotyping, or sexual orientation), age, or disability 
6
status have the economic, social, and political power 
7
and resources to define and make decisions about 
8
their bodies, health, sexuality, families, and commu-
9
nities in all areas of their lives, with dignity and 
10
self-determination. 
11
(5) Reproductive justice seeks to address re-
12
strictions on reproductive health, including abortion, 
13
that perpetuate systems of oppression, lack of bodily 
14
autonomy, white supremacy, and anti-Black racism. 
15
This violent legacy has manifested in policies includ-
16
ing enslavement, rape, and experimentation on Black 
17
women; forced sterilizations; medical experimen-
18
tation on low-income women’s reproductive systems; 
19
and the forcible removal of Indigenous children. Ac-
20
cess to equitable reproductive health care, including 
21
abortion services, has always been deficient in the 
22
United States for Black, Indigenous, and other Peo-
23
ple of Color (BIPOC) and their families.

(6) The legacy of restrictions on reproductive 
1
health, rights, and justice is not a dated vestige of 
2
a dark history. Presently, the harms of abortion-spe-
3
cific restrictions fall especially heavily on people with 
4
low incomes, BIPOC, immigrants, young people, 
5
people with disabilities, and those living in rural and 
6
other medically underserved areas. Abortion-specific 
7
restrictions are even more compounded by the ongo-
8
ing criminalization of people who are pregnant, in-
9
cluding those who are incarcerated, living with HIV, 
10
or with substance-use disorders. These communities 
11
already experience health disparities due to social, 
12
political, and environmental inequities, and restric-
13
tions on abortion services exacerbate these harms. 
14
Removing medically unjustified restrictions on abor-
15
tion services would constitute one important step on 
16
the path toward realizing Reproductive Justice by 
17
ensuring that the full range of reproductive health 
18
care is accessible to all who need it. 
19
(7) Abortion-specific restrictions are a tool of 
20
gender oppression, as they target health care serv-
21
ices that are used primarily by women. These pater-
22
nalistic restrictions rely on and reinforce harmful 
23
stereotypes about gender roles, women’s decision- 
24
making, and women’s need for protection instead of 
25

support, undermining their ability to control their 
1
own lives and well-being. These restrictions harm the 
2
basic autonomy, dignity, and equality of women, and 
3
their ability to participate in the social and economic 
4
life of the Nation. 
5
(8) The terms ‘‘woman’’ and ‘‘women’’ are used 
6
in this bill to reflect the identity of the majority of 
7
people targeted and affected by restrictions on abor-
8
tion services, and to address squarely the targeted 
9
restrictions on abortion, which are rooted in misog-
10
yny. However, access to abortion services is critical 
11
to the health of every person capable of becoming 
12
pregnant. This Act is intended to protect all people 
13
with the capacity for pregnancy—cisgender women, 
14
transgender men, non-binary individuals, those who 
15
identify with a different gender, and others—who 
16
are unjustly harmed by restrictions on abortion serv-
17
ices. 
18
(9) Since 2011, States and local governments 
19
have passed nearly 500 restrictions singling out 
20
health care providers who offer abortion services, 
21
interfering with their ability to provide those services 
22
and the patients’ ability to obtain those services. 
23
(10) Many State and local governments have 
24
imposed restrictions on the provision of abortion 
25
03:21 Jul 13, 2021
H3755

•HR 3755 IH
services that are neither evidence-based nor gen-
1
erally applicable to the medical profession or to 
2
other medically comparable outpatient gynecological 
3
procedures, such as endometrial ablations, dilation 
4
and curettage for reasons other than abortion, 
5
hysteroscopies, loop electrosurgical excision proce-
6
dures, or other analogous non-gynecological proce-
7
dures performed in similar outpatient settings in-
8
cluding vasectomy, sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy. 
9
(11) Abortion is essential health care and one 
10
of the safest medical procedures in the United 
11
States. An independent, comprehensive review of the 
12
state of science on the safety and quality of abortion 
13
services, published by the National Academies of 
14
Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine in 2018, found 
15
that abortion in the United States is safe and effec-
16
tive and that the biggest threats to the quality of 
17
abortion services in the United States are State reg-
18
ulations that create barriers to care. These abortion- 
19
specific restrictions conflict with medical standards 
20
and are not supported by the recommendations and 
21
guidelines issued by leading reproductive health care 
22
professional organizations including the American 
23
College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Soci-

ety of Family Planning, the National Abortion Fed-
1
eration, the World Health Organization, and others. 
2
(12) Many abortion-specific restrictions do not 
3
confer any health or safety benefits on the patient. 
4
Instead, these restrictions have the purpose and ef-
5
fect of unduly burdening people’s personal and pri-
6
vate medical decisions to end their pregnancies by 
7
making access to abortion services more difficult, 
8
invasive, and costly, often forcing people to travel 
9
significant distances and make multiple unnecessary 
10
visits to the provider, and in some cases, foreclosing 
11
the option altogether. For example, a 2018 report 
12
from the University of California San Francisco’s 
13
Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health 
14
research group found that in 27 cities across the 
15
United States, people have to travel more than 100 
16
miles in any direction to reach an abortion provider. 
17
(13) An overwhelming majority of abortions in 
18
the United States are provided in clinics, not hos-
19
pitals, but the large majority of counties throughout 
20
the United States have no clinics that provide abor-
21
tion. 
22
(14) These restrictions additionally harm peo-
23
ple’s health by reducing access not only to abortion 
24
services but also to other essential health care serv-
25
03:21 Jul 13, 2021
H3755

•HR 3755 IH
ices offered by many of the providers targeted by the 
1
restrictions, including— 
2
(A) screenings and preventive services, in-
3
cluding contraceptive services; 
4
(B) testing and treatment for sexually 
5
transmitted infections; 
6
(C) LGBTQ health services; and 
7
(D) referrals for primary care, intimate 
8
partner violence prevention, prenatal care and 
9
adoption services. 
10
(15) The cumulative effect of these numerous 
11
restrictions has been to severely limit the availability 
12
of abortion services in some areas, creating a patch-
13
work system where access to abortion services is 
14
more available in some States than in others. A 
15
2019 report from the Government Accountability Of-
16
fice examining State Medicaid compliance with abor-
17
tion coverage requirements analyzed seven key chal-
18
lenges (identified both by health care providers and 
19
research literature) and their effect on abortion ac-
20
cess, and found that access to abortion services var-
21
ied across the States and even within a State. 
22
(16) International human rights law recognizes 
23
that access to abortion is intrinsically linked to the 
24
rights to life, health, equality and non-discrimina-
25
03:21 Jul 13, 2021
H3755
10 
•HR 3755 IH
tion, privacy, and freedom from ill-treatment. United 
1
Nations (UN) human rights treaty monitoring bod-
2
ies have found that legal abortion services, like other 
3
reproductive health care services, must be available, 
4
accessible, affordable, acceptable, and of good qual-
5
ity. UN human rights treaty bodies have likewise 
6
condemned medically unnecessary barriers to abor-
7
tion services, including mandatory waiting periods, 
8
biased counseling requirements, and third-party au-
9
thorization requirements. 
10
(17) Core human rights treaties ratified by the 
11
United States protect access to abortion. For exam-
12
ple, in 2018, the UN Human Rights Committee, 
13
which oversees implementation of the ICCPR, made 
14
clear that the right to life, enshrined in Article 6 of 
15
the ICCPR, at a minimum requires governments to 
16
provide safe, legal, and effective access to abortion 
17
where a person’s life and health is at risk, or when 
18
carrying a pregnancy to term would cause substan-
19
tial pain or suffering. The Committee stated that 
20
governments must not impose restrictions on abor-
21
tion which subject women and girls to physical or 
22
mental pain or suffering, discriminate against them, 
23
arbitrarily interfere with their privacy, or place them 
24
at risk of undertaking unsafe abortions. Further-
25
03:21 Jul 13, 2021
H3755
11 
•HR 3755 IH
more, the Committee stated that governments should 
1
remove existing barriers that deny effective access to 
2
safe and legal abortion, refrain from introducing 
3
new barriers to abortion, and prevent the stigmatiza-
4
tion of those seeking abortion. 
5
(18) UN independent human rights experts 
6
have expressed particular concern about barriers to 
7
abortion services in the United States. For example, 
8
at the conclusion of his 2017 visit to the United 
9
States, the UN Special Rapporteur on extreme pov-
10
erty and human rights noted concern that low-in-
11
come women face legal and practical obstacles to ex-
12
ercising their constitutional right to access abortion 
13
services, trapping many women in cycles of poverty. 
14
Similarly, in May 2020, the UN Working Group on 
15
discrimination against women and girls, along with 
16
other human rights experts, expressed concern that 
17
some states had manipulated the COVID–19 crisis 
18
to restrict access to abortion, which the experts rec-
19
ognized as ‘‘the latest example illustrating a pattern 
20
of restrictions and retrogressions in access to legal 
21
abortion care across the country’’ and reminded 
22
U.S. authorities that abortion care constitutes essen-
23
tial health care that must remain available during 
24
and after the pandemic. They noted that barriers to 
25
03:21 Jul 13, 2021
H3755
12 
•HR 3755 IH
abortion access exacerbate systemic inequalities and 
1
cause particular harm to marginalized communities, 
2
including low-income people, people of color, immi-
3
grants, people with disabilities, and LGBTQ people. 
4
(19) Abortion-specific restrictions affect the 
5
cost and availability of abortion services, and the 
6
settings in which abortion services are delivered. 
7
People travel across State lines and otherwise en-
8
gage in interstate commerce to access this essential 
9
medical care, and more would be forced to do so ab-
10
sent this Act. Likewise, health care providers travel 
11
across State lines and otherwise engage in interstate 
12
commerce in order to provide abortion services to 
13
patients, and more would be forced to do so absent 
14
this Act. 
15
(20) Health care providers engage in a form of 
16
economic and commercial activity when they provide 
17
abortion services, and there is an interstate market 
18
for abortion services. 
19
(21) Abortion restrictions substantially affect 
20
interstate commerce in numerous ways. For exam-
21
ple, to provide abortion services, health care pro-
22
viders engage in interstate commerce to purchase 
23
medicine, medical equipment, and other necessary 
24
goods and services. To provide and assist others in 
25
03:21 Jul 13, 2021
H3755
13 
•HR 3755 IH
providing abortion services, health care providers en-
1
gage in interstate commerce to obtain and provide 
2
training. To provide abortion services, health care 
3
providers employ and obtain commercial services 
4
from doctors, nurses, and other personnel who en-
5
gage in interstate commerce and travel across State 
6
lines. 
7
(22) It is difficult and time and resource-con-
8
suming for clinics to challenge State laws that bur-
9
den or impede abortion services. Litigation that 
10
blocks one abortion restriction may not prevent a 
11
State from adopting other similarly burdensome 
12
abortion restrictions or using different methods to 
13
burden or impede abortion services. There is a his-
14
tory and pattern of States passing successive and 
15
different laws that unduly burden abortion services. 
16
(23) When a health care provider ceases pro-
17
viding abortion services as a result of burdensome 
18
and medically unnecessary regulations, it is often 
19
difficult or impossible for that health care provider 
20
to recommence providing those abortion services, 
21
and difficult or impossible for other health care pro-
22
viders to provide abortion services that restore or re-
23
place the ceased abortion services.

(24) Health care providers are subject to license 
1
laws in various jurisdictions, which are not affected 
2
by this Act except as provided in this Act. 
3
(25) Congress has the authority to enact this 
4
Act to protect abortion services pursuant to— 
5
(A) its powers under the commerce clause 
6
of section 8 of article I of the Constitution of 
7
the United States; 
8
(B) its powers under section 5 of the Four-
9
teenth Amendment to the Constitution of the 
10
United States to enforce the provisions of sec-
11
tion 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment; and 
12
(C) its powers under the necessary and 
13
proper clause of section 8 of Article I of the 
14
Constitution of the United States. 
15
(26) Congress has used its authority in the past 
16
to protect access to abortion services and health care 
17
providers’ ability to provide abortion services. In the 
18
early 1990s, protests and blockades at health care 
19
facilities where abortion services were provided, and 
20
associated violence, increased dramatically and 
21
reached crisis level, requiring Congressional action. 
22
Congress passed the Freedom of Access to Clinic 
23
Entrances Act (Public Law 103–259; 108 Stat. 694)

•HR 3755 IH
to address that situation and protect physical access 
1
to abortion services. 
2
(27) Congressional action is necessary to put an 
3
end to harmful restrictions, to federally protect ac-
4
cess to abortion services for everyone regardless of 
5
where they live, and to protect the ability of health 
6
care providers to provide these services in a safe and 
7
accessible manner. 
8
(b) PURPOSE.—It is the purpose of this Act— 
9
(1) to permit health care providers to provide 
10
abortion services without limitations or requirements 
11
that single out the provision of abortion services for 
12
restrictions that are more burdensome than those re-
13
strictions imposed on medically comparable proce-
14
dures, do not significantly advance reproductive 
15
health or the safety of abortion services, and make

abortion services more difficult to access;

(2) to promote access to abortion services and 
18
women’s ability to participate equally in the eco-
19
nomic and social life of the United States; and 
20
(3) to invoke Congressional authority, including 
21
the powers of Congress under the commerce clause

11
for seeking abortion services, or a limitation on the 
12
provision or obtaining of abortion services at any

point or points in time prior to fetal viability based

on any actual, perceived, or potential reason or rea-
15
sons of the patient for obtaining abortion services,

•HR 3755 IH
(1) is the same as or similar to one or more of 
1
the limitations or requirements described in sub-
2
section (a); or 
3
(2) both— 
4
(A) expressly, effectively, implicitly, or as 
5
implemented singles out the provision of abor-
6
tion services, health care providers who provide 
7
abortion services, or facilities in which abortion 
8
services are provided; and 
9
(B) impedes access to abortion services. 
10
(c) FACTORS FOR CONSIDERATION.—Factors a court 
11
may consider in determining whether a limitation or re-
12
quirement impedes access to abortion services for purposes 
13
of subsection (b)(2)(B) include the following: 
14
(1) Whether the limitation or requirement, in a 
15
provider’s good-faith medical judgment, interferes 
16
with a health care provider’s ability to provide care 
17
and render services, or poses a risk to the patient’s 
18
health or safety. 
19
(2) Whether the limitation or requirement is 
20
reasonably likely to delay or deter some patients in 
21
accessing abortion services. 
22
(3) Whether the limitation or requirement is 
23
reasonably likely to directly or indirectly increase the 
24
cost of providing abortion services or the cost for ob-
25

22 
•HR 3755 IH
taining abortion services (including costs associated 
1
with travel, childcare, or time off work). 
2
(4) Whether the limitation or requirement is 
3
reasonably likely to have the effect of necessitating 
4
a trip to the offices of a health care provider that 
5
would not otherwise be required. 
6
(5) Whether the limitation or requirement is 
7
reasonably likely to result in a decrease in the avail-
8
ability of abortion services in a given State or geo-
9
graphic region. 
10
(6) Whether the limitation or requirement im-
11
poses penalties that are not imposed on other health 
12
care providers for comparable conduct or failure to 
13
act, or that are more severe than penalties imposed 
14
on other health care providers for comparable con-
15
duct or failure to act. 
16
(7) The cumulative impact of the limitation or 
17
requirement combined with other new or existing 
18
limitations or requirements. 
19
(d) EXCEPTION.—To defend against a claim that a 
20
limitation or requirement violates a health care provider’s 
21
or patient’s statutory rights under subsection (b), a party 
22
must establish, by clear and convincing evidence, that— 
23
03:21 Jul 13, 2021
H3755
23 
•HR 3755 IH
(1) the limitation or requirement significantly 
1
advances the safety of abortion services or the health 
2
of patients; and 
3
(2) the safety of abortion services or the health 
4
of patients cannot be advanced by a less restrictive 
5
alternative measure or action.
