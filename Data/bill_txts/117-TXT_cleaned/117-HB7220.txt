•HR 7220 IH
(1) more than 17 million people live in manu-
1
factured homes, benefiting from high-quality afford-
2
able homes that can provide them stability; 
3
(2) owners of manufactured homes are dis-
4
proportionately low-income households: in 2013, the 
5
median annual household income for those living in 
6
manufactured housing was $28,400; 
7
(3) about 75 percent of manufactured home 
8
households earn less than $50,000; 
9
(4) over 10 percent of United States veterans 
10
live in manufactured homes; 
11
(5) in the late 1990s, manufactured housing 
12
represented two-thirds of the new affordable housing 
13
produced in the United States, and it remains the 
14
largest source of unsubsidized affordable housing in 
15
the country; 
16
(6) as of 2015, the average cost per square foot 
17
for a new manufactured home was $48, less than 
18
half the $101 per square foot of the structure-only 
19
cost of a new site-built home; 
20
(7) in 2009, 43 percent of all new homes that 
21
sold for less than $150,000 were manufactured 
22
homes; 
23
(8) manufactured homes account for 23 percent 
24
of new home sales under $200,000; 
25

(9) more than 50,000 manufactured home com-
1
munities, or ‘‘mobile home parks’’, exist throughout 
2
the United States; 
3
(10) more than 2.9 million manufactured homes 
4
are placed in manufactured home communities; 
5
(11) manufactured home communities provide 
6
critical affordable housing but receive very little 
7
local, State, or Federal funds subsidizing the cost of 
8
these homes; 
9
(12) manufactured home owners in commu-
10
nities may own the home, but they do not own the 
11
land under their homes, leaving them vulnerable to 
12
rent increases, arbitrary rule enforcement, and even 
13
closure of the community if the community owner 
14
decides to convert the land to some other use; 
15
(13) eviction or closure of manufactured home 
16
communities is very disruptive to residents who may 
17
be unable to pay the thousands of dollars it takes to 
18
move their home or even find a new location for 
19
their home; 
20
(14) in the past two decades, a national net-
21
work of housing providers has helped residents pur-
22
chase and own the land and manage the community 
23
in order to preserve a crucial source of affordable 
24
housing;

(15) nationwide, there are more than 1,000 of 
1
these stable, permanent ownership cooperatives or 
2
nonprofit-owned developments in more than a dozen 
3
States; 
4
(16) members continue to own their own homes 
5
individually and an equal share of the land beneath 
6
the entire neighborhood where everyone has a say in 
7
the way the resident-owned community is run, and 
8
major decisions are made by democratic vote by a 
9
member-elected board of directors; 
10
(17) in New Hampshire, more than 20 percent 
11
of manufactured home communities are owned by 
12
residents; 
13
(18) in Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, 
14
Washington, Oregon, and Minnesota, resident-owned 
15
cooperatives and nonprofit ownership have flour-
16
ished; 
17
(19) nationwide, only 2 percent of all manufac-
18
tured home communities are resident- or nonprofit- 
19
owned; 
20
(20) owners are frequently reluctant to sell the 
21
community because they would prefer to pass the 
22
property on to their heirs tax free and avoid capital 
23
gains taxes; 
24

•HR 7220 IH
(21) when the owner dies, the heirs frequently 
1
sell the community to the highest bidder resulting in 
2
displacement for dozens and sometimes hundreds of 
3
families; and 
4
(22) a Federal tax benefit needs to be estab-
5
lished to induce owners to sell to residents they have 
6
known for decades or to nonprofit organizations in 
7
order to preserve the community for years to come.
