SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Puppies Assisting 
2
Wounded Servicemembers for Veterans Therapy Act’’ or 
3
the ‘‘PAWS for Veterans Therapy Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
5
Congress makes the following findings: 
6
(1) According to the analyses of veteran suicide 
7
published by the Department of Veterans Affairs in 
8
August 2016 and titled ‘‘Suicide Among Veterans 
9
and Other Americans’’, and in June 2018, titled 
10
‘‘VA National Suicide Date Report’’— 
11
(A) an average of 20 veterans died by sui-
12
cide each day in 2014; 
13
(B) mental health disorders, including 
14
major depression and other mood disorders, 
15
have been associated with increased risk for sui-
16
cide; 
17
(C) since 2001, the proportion of users of 
18
the Veterans Health Administration with men-
19
tal health conditions or substance use disorders 
20
has increased from approximately 27 percent in 
21
2001 to more than 40 percent in 2014; and 
22
(D) overall, suicide rates are highest 
23
among patients with mental health and sub-
24
stance use disorder diagnoses who are in treat-
25
ment and lower among those who received a

mental health diagnosis but were not at risk 
1
enough to require enhanced care from a mental 
2
health provider. 
3
(2) The Department of Veterans Affairs must 
4
be more effective in its approach to reducing the 
5
burden of veteran suicide connected to mental health 
6
disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder 
7
(in this section referred to as ‘‘PTSD’’), and new, 
8
rigorous scientific research provides persuasive 
9
weight to the growing anecdotal evidence that serv-
10
ice dogs ameliorate the symptoms associated with 
11
PTSD, and in particular, help prevent veteran sui-
12
cide. 
13
(3) Several organizations have proven track 
14
records of training service dogs for veterans with se-
15
vere PTSD and dramatically improving those vet-
16
erans’ quality of life, ability to re-enter society, and, 
17
most importantly, their chances of survival.
