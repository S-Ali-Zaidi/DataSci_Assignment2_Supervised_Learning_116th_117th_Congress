tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The lack of accessible, developmentally ap-
3
propriate, culturally aware, and trauma-informed 
4
emergency response protocols for children and youth 
5
in public schools, early child care and education set-
6
tings, and institutions of higher education is not a 
7
trivial issue: 
8
(A) In 2016, there were 12,032,000 chil-
9
dren from ages 3 to 5 enrolled in preprimary 
10
education programs, and almost one-quarter of 
11
children under the age of 5 are in some form 
12
of child care arrangement, including nurseries, 
13
child care centers, and preschools. 
14
(B) In the 2017–2018 school year— 
15
(i) 14 percent of students in grades 
16
kindergarten through grade 12 had a dis-
17
ability; and 
18
(ii) 
11 
percent 
of 
students 
in 
19
postbaccalaureate programs self-identified 
20
as having a disability. 
21
(2) As of the date of enactment of this Act, lit-
22
tle has been done to integrate specific populations, 
23
such as children and youth at various developmental 
24
stages or children and youth with disabilities, into 
25
emergency preparedness planning. 
26
21:34 May 26, 2022
H7859

•HR 7859 IH
(3) In 2018 alone, there were 108 natural dis-
1
asters in the United States, including severe thun-
2
derstorms, floods, wildfires, droughts, earthquakes, 
3
and other extreme weather. 
4
(4) During the 16 academic years from 2000 
5
through 2015, there were 85 fatal fires in dor-
6
mitories, fraternities, sororities, and off-campus 
7
housing, resulting in 118 fatalities—an average of 
8
approximately 7 per school year. 
9
(5) The risks associated with natural and man-
10
made disasters have a disproportionate impact on in-
11
dividuals with disabilities. People with disabilities 
12
are 2 to 4 times more likely to die or sustain critical 
13
injuries during a disaster than people without dis-
14
abilities. 
15
(6) Technology plays an increasingly vital role 
16
in emergency communications but remains largely 
17
inaccessible for many individuals with disabilities. 
18
(7) The rise of gun violence and gun violence- 
19
related deaths has contributed to the expansion of 
20
school security technologies and devices. While such 
21
technologies and devices have the potential to save 
22
lives, they have largely been developed without con-
23
sideration of the needs of students at various devel-
24
opmental stages or students with disabilities. Thus, 
25
21:34 May 26, 2022
H7859
4 
•HR 7859 IH
there may be inherent biases within these tech-
1
nologies and devices that disadvantage or create bias 
2
toward specific populations. 
3
(8) As of the date of enactment of this Act, 92 
4
percent of schools nationwide have an active shooter 
5
lockdown protocol. More than 1,000,000 elementary- 
6
age children experienced a lockdown in the 2017– 
7
2018 school year, and among that group, at least 
8
220,000 were in kindergarten or prekindergarten. 
9
(9) While the Department of Homeland Secu-
10
rity active shooter emergency guidelines recommend 
11
that students and personnel in school and early child 
12
care and education settings ‘‘Run, Hide, and Fight’’, 
13
these strategies can exacerbate danger for young 
14
children in prekindergarten and child care centers, 
15
and can exclude and put at risk students with a 
16
wide range of disabilities. 
17
(10) At the height of the 2019 novel 
18
coronavirus (COVID–19) pandemic, emergency clo-
19
sures of early education centers, elementary schools, 
20
secondary schools, and institutions of higher edu-
21
cation created great disruptions in learning and cast 
22
a light on educational institutions’ lack of prepared-
23
ness protocols for public health emergencies. 
24
21:34 May 26, 2022
H7859
5 
•HR 7859 IH
(11) During the pandemic, early care and edu-
1
cation remains indispensable for the development of 
2
children and for millions of health care workers, first 
3
responders, educators, and essential personnel, and 
4
it is imperative that early care and education centers 
5
and schools have emergency preparedness plans to 
6
ensure the safety of students and educators. 
7
(12) Emergency preparation drills and real-life 
8
lockdowns where danger may be external can create 
9
undue stress, fear, and trauma in children, youth, 
10
employees, and other specific populations in schools, 
11
early child care and education settings, and institu-
12
tions of higher education. 
13
(13) Traumatic events have a long-lasting and 
14
profound sensory impact on young children, as birth 
15
to age 5 is a critical developmental age. Frightening 
16
visual stimuli, loud noises, violent movements, and 
17
other sensations associated with an unpredictable 
18
frightening event, such as in an emergency prepara-
19
tion drill or lockdown, can cause substantial stress. 
20
Unlike older children, young children cannot express 
21
in words whether they feel afraid, overwhelmed, or 
22
helpless, and may have difficulty regulating their be-
23
havior and emotions after experiencing trauma. 
24
21:34 May 26, 2022
H7859
6 
•HR 7859 IH
(14) There is an increasing need to ensure the 
1
establishment of accessible, developmentally appro-
2
priate, culturally aware, and trauma-informed emer-
3
gency response protocols, including gun violence re-
4
sponse and prevention protocols, natural disaster 
5
preparedness procedures, fire drills, and other emer-
6
gency preparation drills or lockdown procedures, in 
7
public schools, early child care and education set-
