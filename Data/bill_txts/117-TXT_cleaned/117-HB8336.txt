‘‘(1) STANDARDS.—The Administrator shall, by 
5
regulation, require each vessel on a covered voyage 
6
to comply with standards for the carbon intensity of 
7
the fuel used by such vessel so that such carbon in-
8
tensity is— 
9
‘‘(A) in each of calendar years 2027 
10
through 2029, at least 20 percent less than the 
11
carbon intensity baseline; 
12
‘‘(B) in each of calendar years 2030 
13
through 2034, at least 45 percent less than the 
14
carbon intensity baseline; 
15
‘‘(C) in each of calendar years 2035

‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—If the Administrator 
7
determines that a reduction in carbon intensity 
8
required under paragraph (1) is not techno-
9
logically or economically feasible by the applica-
10
ble deadline under such paragraph, the Admin-
11
istrator, in lieu of promulgating the standard 
12
otherwise required by paragraph (1), shall pro-
13
mulgate a standard that will achieve the max-
14
imum reduction in the carbon intensity of the 
15
fuel used by vessels on covered voyages that is 
16
technologically and economically feasible by 
17
such applicable deadline. 
18
‘‘(B) CONSIDERATIONS.—In determining 
19
technological and economic feasibility for pur-
20
poses of subparagraph (A), the Administrator 
21
shall take into account the net reduction of 
22
emissions of greenhouse gases and potential ad-
23
verse impacts on public health, safety, and the 
24
environment, including with respect to air qual-

posal of solid waste.

‘‘(4) HARMONIZATION
WITH
INTERNATIONAL 
3
STANDARDS.—If the Administrator determines that 
4
standards mandated by the International Maritime 
5
Organization for reduction of the carbon intensity of 
6
fuel used by vessels for a calendar year are equally 
7
or more stringent than the standards under para-
8
graph (1) for such calendar year, the Administrator 
9
may adopt such standards. 
10
‘‘(5) EXEMPTION.—Any vessel that is on cov-
11
ered voyages for 30 days or fewer during a calendar 
12
year shall be exempt from the standards promul-
13
gated under this subsection for that year. 
14
‘‘(6) COMMON OWNERSHIP OR CONTROL.—For 
15
purposes of determining compliance with any stand-
16
ard established under this subsection, the Adminis-
17
trator may allow the carbon intensity of the fuels 
18
used by vessels under common ownership or control 
19
to be averaged. 
20
‘‘(7) OVERCOMPLIANCE.—The Administrator 
21
may allow vessels to credit overcompliance with any 
22
standard established under this subsection towards 
23
demonstrating compliance with any future standard 
24
under this subsection.

For each calendar year, a vessel shall report to the
