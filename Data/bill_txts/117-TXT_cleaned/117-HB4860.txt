A BILL 
To amend the Child Abuse Protection and Treatment Act 
to incentivize States to eliminate civil and criminal stat-
utes of limitations and revive time-barred civil claims 
for child abuse cases, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Statutes of Limitation 
4
for Child Sexual Abuse Reform Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 4860 IH
(1) Child sexual abuse is a pernicious crime 
1
perpetrated through threats of violence, intimidation, 
2
manipulation, and abuse of power. 
3
(2) The prevalence of child sexual abuse is dif-
4
ficult to determine because it is often not reported; 
5
however, data suggests that child sexual abuse is a 
6
public health epidemic that affects 1 in 5 girls, and 
7
1 in 13 boys in the Nation. 
8
(3) The prevalence of child sex trafficking is 
9
difficult to estimate, but NCMEC estimates that at 
10
least 100,000 children are victims of trafficking, 
11
with some estimates as high as 2 or 3 million chil-
12
dren. 
13
(4) It is estimated that there are approximately 
14
9 million cases of child abuse and exploitation re-
15
ported every year in the United States. 
16
(5) Historically, 90 percent of child victims 
17
never go to the authorities and the vast majority of 
18
claims have expired before the victims were capable 
19
of getting to court. 
20
(6) Due to the subversive nature of this crime, 
21
the average age of disclosure of child sexual abuse 
22
does not occur until a victim is over 52 years old. 
23
(7) Because many State statutes of limitations 
24
applicable to laws involving child sexual abuse fail to 
25

•HR 4860 IH
give victims adequate time to come forward and re-
1
port their abuse, numerous victims are unable to 
2
seek fair and just remediation against their abusers. 
3
(8) Due to the especially heinous nature of 
4
child sexual abuse, it is imperative that perpetrators 
5
of this crime are punished, prevented from re-
6
offending, and victims have the opportunity to see 
7
their abusers brought to justice. 
8
(9) The negative effects over a survivor’s life-
9
time generate many costs that impact the Nation’s 
10
health care, education, criminal justice, and welfare 
11
systems, with the economic burden of child sexual 
12
abuse estimated at nearly $2 trillion annually.
