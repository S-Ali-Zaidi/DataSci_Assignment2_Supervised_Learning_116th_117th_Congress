A BILL 
To prohibit discrimination on the basis of religion, sex (in-
cluding sexual orientation and gender identity), and mar-
ital status in the administration and provision of child 
welfare services; to improve safety, well-being, and per-
manency for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and 
queer/questioning foster youth, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘John Lewis Every 
2
Child Deserves a Family Act’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. 
4
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) Every child or youth unable to live with 
6
their family of origin is entitled to a supportive and 
7
affirming foster care placement. Federal law re-
8
quires, and child welfare experts recommend, that 
9
children and youth be placed with a family or in the 
10
most family-like setting available. 
11
(2) Thousands of children and youth lack a sta-
12
ble, safe, and loving temporary or permanent home 
13
and have been placed in a congregate care setting, 
14
which is associated with more placements, poorer 
15
educational outcomes, and greater risk of further 
16
trauma. More homes are needed to accommodate the 
17
growing number of children and youth involved with 
18
child welfare services. 
19
(3) On the last day of fiscal year 2019, there 
20
were an estimated 424,000 children and youth in the 
21
United States foster care system, and 122,000 were 
22
waiting to be adopted. Tragically, approximately 
23
20,000 ‘‘aged out’’ of the child welfare system with-
24
out a forever family, placing them at higher risk of 
25
21:32 Jul 26, 2021
H3488

•HR 3488 IH
negative outcomes including poverty, homelessness, 
1
incarceration, and early parenthood. 
2
(4) Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 
3
U.S.C. 2000d et seq.) protects people from discrimi-
4
nation based on race, color, or national origin in 
5
programs, activities, and services administered or 
6
performed by child welfare agencies. Eliminating dis-
7
crimination in child welfare based on religion, sex 
8
(including sexual orientation and gender identity), 
9
and marital status would increase the number and 
10
diversity of foster and adoptive homes able to meet 
11
the individual needs of children and youth removed 
12
from their homes. 
13
(5) Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and 
14
queer/questioning (referred to in this Act as 
15
‘‘LGBTQ’’) youth are overrepresented in the foster 
16
care system by at least a factor of 2, comprising at 
17
least 30 percent of children and youth in foster care; 
18
these numbers are higher for transgender and non-
19
binary youth compared to their cisgender LGBQ 
20
counterparts. 
21
(A) While some LGBTQ youth enter foster 
22
care for similar reasons as non-LGBTQ youth, 
23
the two most common reasons for LGBTQ 
24
21:32 Jul 26, 2021
H3488

•HR 3488 IH
youth are high rates of physical abuse and con-
1
flict with parents. 
2
(B) LGBTQ foster youth report twice the 
3
rate of poor treatment while in care experienced 
4
by foster youth who do not identify as LGBTQ 
5
and are more likely to experience discrimina-
6
tion, harassment, and violence in the child wel-
7
fare system than their LGBTQ peers not in the 
8
child welfare system. 
9
(C) Because of high levels of bias, LGBTQ 
10
foster youth have a higher average number of 
11
placements and higher likelihood of living in a 
12
group home than their non-LGBTQ peers, neg-
13
atively affecting mental health outcomes and 
14
long-term prospects. 
15
(D) Approximately 28 percent of homeless 
16
youth with histories of time in foster care iden-
17
tified as LGBTQ and were significantly more 
18
likely to experience 7 of 8 adverse events com-
19
pared to their peers with no foster care history. 
20
(E) LGBTQ youth in foster care had near-
21
ly 3 times greater odds of reporting a past-year 
22
suicide attempt compared to LGBTQ youth 
23
who were never in foster care (35% versus 
24
13%); these numbers were even higher for 
25
21:32 Jul 26, 2021
H3488
5 
•HR 3488 IH
LGBTQ foster youth of color (38%) and high-
1
est for transgender and non-binary foster youth 
2
(45%). 
3
(F) LGBTQ youth who had been in foster 
4
care had over 3 times greater odds of being 
5
kicked out, abandoned, or running away due to 
6
treatment based on their LGBTQ identity com-
7
pared to those who were never in foster care 
8
(27% versus 8%); these numbers were higher 
9
for LGBTQ foster youth of color (30%) and 
10
highest for transgender and non-binary foster 
11
youth (40%). 
12
(6) ‘‘Conversion therapy’’ is a form of discrimi-
13
nation that harms LGBTQ people. It undermines an 
14
individual’s sense of self-worth, increases suicide ide-
15
ation and substance abuse, exacerbates family con-
16
flict, and contributes to second-class status. No sci-
17
entifically valid evidence supports this discredited 
18
practice, which is prohibited by many States and 
19
foreign nations. Approximately 350,000 LGBTQ 
20
adults were subjected to so-called ‘‘conversion ther-
21
apy’’ as adolescents, and an estimated 16,000 
22
LGBTQ youth ages 13 to 17 will be subjected to it 
23
by a licensed health care professional before age 18. 
24

•HR 3488 IH
(7) Many youth, especially LGBTQ youth, in-
1
volved with child welfare services identify with a 
2
cross-section of marginalized communities. Youth of 
3
color are overrepresented in the foster care system, 
4
and the majority of LGBTQ foster youth are youth 
5
of color. Children and youth with multiple margina-
6
lized identities often experience more stress and 
7
trauma than other youth, compounding the negative 
8
effects of discrimination and increasing the likeli-
9
hood of negative outcomes. 
10
(8) Prospective parents who experience the 
11
heartbreak and dignitary harm of discrimination 
12
based on religion, sex (including sexual orientation 
13
and gender identity), or marital status may not be 
14
able or willing to apply at another agency, resulting 
15
in fewer available homes, and knowing that discrimi-
16
nation exists may deter them from even attempting 
17
to foster or adopt. 
18
(9) Professional organizations that serve chil-
19
dren in the fields of medicine, psychology, law, and 
20
child welfare oppose discrimination against prospec-
21
tive parents in adoption and foster care. 
22
(10) Religious organizations play a critical role 
23
in providing child welfare services. Most welcome all 
24
children, youth, and families and affirm a diversity 
25
21:32 Jul 26, 2021
H3488
7 
•HR 3488 IH
of religions and faiths. State assessments, planning, 
1
and counseling should connect children and youth 
2
for whom spirituality and religion are important 
3
with affirming, faith-based resources consistent with 
4
the faith of the child or youth. 
5
(11) Child welfare agencies that refuse to serve 
6
same-sex couples and LGBTQ individuals reduce the 
7
pool of qualified and available homes for children 
8
and youth who need placement on a temporary or 
9
permanent basis. 
10
(A) Same-sex couples are 7 times more 
11
likely to foster and adopt than their different- 
12
sex counterparts. 
13
(B) Same-sex couples raising adopted chil-
14
dren tend to be older than, just as educated as, 
15
and have access to the same economic resources 
16
as other adoptive parents. 
17
(C) Research shows that sexual orientation 
18
is a nondeterminative factor in parental success 
19
and that children with same-sex parents have 
20
the same advantages and expectations for 
21
health, social, and psychological development as 
22
children whose parents are different-sex. 
23
(D) Discrimination against qualified pro-
24
spective foster and adoptive parents for non- 
25
21:32 Jul 26, 2021

•HR 3488 IH
merit related reasons denies religious minority, 
1
LGBTQ, and unmarried relatives the oppor-
2
tunity to become foster and adoptive parents 
3
for their own kin in care, including grand-
4
children. 
5
(12) LGBTQ families of origin are at risk for 
6
discrimination in child welfare referrals, investiga-
7
tions, removals, reunification, kinship placements, 
8
and other case management services. A study of low- 
9
income African-American mothers showed that those 
10
who identified as lesbian or bisexual were four times 
11
more likely than their non-LGBTQ counterparts to 
12
lose custody of their children in child welfare pro-
13
ceedings. LGBTQ-positive services are necessary to 
14
shield families and protect parents’ rights to reunifi-
15
cation. 
16
(13) Single people are more likely than couples 
17
to experience challenges in adopting due to biases 
18
that persist against single-parent adoption. During 
19
fiscal year 2019, 29 percent of adoptions from foster 
20
care were completed by unmarried single people, in-
21
cluding adoptions by 2,200 single men and more 
22
than 16,800 single women. Studies show that the 
23
outcomes for children adopted and raised by single 
24
21:32 Jul 26, 2021

9 
•HR 3488 IH
parents are just as good as, if not better than, out-
1
comes for children adopted by couples. 
2
(14) More nationwide data about the experi-
3
ences of LGBTQ children and youth involved with 
4
child welfare services is needed to understand fully 
5
the extent and impact of discrimination and ensure 
6
accountability. States must report and researchers 
7
must collect this sensitive data in an ethical, affirm-
8
ing, and non-intrusive manner, with appropriate 
9
safeguards to protect respondents.

(b) PURPOSE.—The purposes of this Act are—

15
Federal funds; and 
16
(2) to improve safety, well-being, and perma-
17
