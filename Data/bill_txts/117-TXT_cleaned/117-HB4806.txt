SEC. 2. TRANSNATIONAL REPRESSION ACCOUNTABILITY 
1
AND PREVENTION.

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following find-
3
ings: 
4
(1) The International Criminal Police Organiza-
5
tion (INTERPOL) works to prevent and fight crime 
6
through enhanced cooperation and innovation on po-
7
lice and security matters, including kleptocracy, 
8
counterterrorism, cybercrime, counternarcotics, and 
9
transnational organized crime. 
10
(2) United States membership and participation 
11
in INTERPOL advances the national security and 
12
law enforcement interests of the United States re-
13
lated 
to 
combating 
kleptocracy, 
terrorism, 
14
cybercrime, narcotics, and transnational organized 
15
crime. 
16
(3) Article 2 of INTERPOL’s Constitution 
17
states that the organization aims ‘‘[to] ensure and 
18
promote the widest possible mutual assistance be-
19
tween all criminal police authorities . . . in the spir-
20
it of the ‘Universal Declaration of Human Rights’ ’’. 
21
(4) Article 3 of INTERPOL’s Constitution 
22
states that ‘‘[i]t is strictly forbidden for the Organi-
23
zation to undertake any intervention or activities of 
24
a political, military, religious or racial character’’. 
25

•HR 4806 IH
(5) These principles provide INTERPOL with a 
1
foundation based on respect for human rights and 
2
avoidance of politically motivated actions by the or-
3
ganization and its members. 
4
(6) According to the Justice Manual of the 
5
United States Department of Justice, ‘‘[i]n the 
6
United States, national law prohibits the arrest of 
7
the subject of a Red Notice issued by another 
8
INTERPOL member country, based upon the notice 
9
alone’’. 
10
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
11
gress that some INTERPOL member countries have re-
12
peatedly misused INTERPOL’s databases and processes, 
13
including Notice and Diffusion mechanisms, for activities 
14
of an overtly political or other unlawful character and in 
15
violation of international human rights standards, includ-
16
ing making requests to harass or persecute political oppo-
17
nents, human rights defenders, or journalists. 
18
(c) SUPPORT FOR INTERPOL INSTITUTIONAL RE-
19
FORMS.—The Attorney General and the Secretary of State 
20
shall— 
21
(1) use the voice, vote, and influence of the 
22

23
General Assembly and Executive Committee to pro-
24

18

19
