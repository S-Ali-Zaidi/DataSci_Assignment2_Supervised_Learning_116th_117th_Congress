and indigenous music from across the United States, 
have all transcended boundaries; 
Whereas the Hip Hop genre has been reinvented often over 
the years since 1973, reflecting the State, city, and re-

Coast, to Bass and Trap in the South, to Drill in the 
Midwest, to many other sounds from coast to coast and 
from abroad, including the New School, which continues 
that trend; 
Whereas Hip Hop artists and supporters, originally of Afri-

ethnicities, religions, locations, political affiliations, and 
socioeconomic statuses, which demonstrates the melting- 
pot quality of Hip Hop art and culture; 
Whereas the art and culture of Hip Hop have been adapted 
in many innovative forms that are inspirational, chal-
lenging, humorous, thought-provoking, and spiritual;
