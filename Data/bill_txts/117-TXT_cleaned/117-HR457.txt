RESOLUTION 
Expressing that the United States must establish electricity 
as a basic human right and public good, and eradicate 
the reliance on monopolized, profit-driven utility corpora-
tions and providers and the flawed regulatory regime 
that has failed to regulate these utilities in the public 
interest. 
Whereas scientists globally have determined that the human- 
caused climate emergency is bringing widespread harms, 
including deadly heat waves and drought, severe flooding 
and storm events, threats to public health and safety, 
limited and inconsistent water and energy access, and 
rampant biodiversity loss;

Whereas energy, water, broadband, and other utilities are 
basic needs for survival and good health and should be 
publicly owned and accessible to all; 
Whereas the current energy system reflects historically en-
trenched, structural racism, whereby Black, Brown, In-
digenous, and other communities of color face dispropor-
tionately high energy burdens, the threat of and actual 
disconnection from service, and local air and water pollu-
tion from fossil fuel energy generation; 
Whereas, one-third of people in the United States struggle 
annually to pay their electricity bills, with Black, Brown, 
Indigenous, and people of color hit the hardest of 
25,000,000 households that have had to forgo food or 
medicine to pay utilities bills, 7,000,000 said they had to 
make that decision every month; 
Whereas pollution from gas infrastructure, often owned by 
the private energy industry, has increased the risk of 
cancer for 1,000,000 Black Americans, and Black com-
munities have 1.54 times the exposure to particulate mat-
ter compared to the overall American population; 
Whereas the status quo energy system threatens to bring the 
planet past climate tipping points that cannot be re-
versed, which threaten more catastrophic impacts; 
Whereas to mitigate the climate emergency and maintain a 
chance of meeting the 1.5 degree Celsius global warming 
target, United States greenhouse gas emissions must de-
cline to zero by 2030; 
Whereas the United States is the world’s largest historic 
emitter of greenhouse gas pollution, responsible for ap-
proximately 25 percent of cumulative carbon dioxide 
emissions since 1870;

•HRES 457 IH 
Whereas the electricity sector, along with the building and 
transportation sectors, is the leading source of United 
States greenhouse gas emissions, and with the transition 
off gas and petroleum products, there will be a substan-
tial need to expand electrification; 
Whereas scientists have highlighted the importance of imme-
diately halting all new fossil fuel infrastructure projects 
in the United States to meet 1.5 degree Celsius targets; 
Whereas major investor-owned utilities are not on track to 
meet national decarbonization goals and currently rely 
heavily on fossil fuels; 
Whereas the utilities crisis in Texas in 2021, grid failures in 
California, annual Atlantic hurricanes, Midwest heat 
waves, and West Coast wildfires act as potent examples 
of the failures of an investor-owned and heavily 
marketized system to ensure reliability and resilience to 
climate catastrophes; 
Whereas renewable energy resources, particularly solar plus- 
storage, microgrids, and other distributed sources provide 
climate and economic resilience benefits to communities; 
Whereas investor-owned utilities and the State utility com-
missions tasked to regulate them are failing to meet their 
collective mandates to serve the public interest and pro-
vide customers with just and reasonable electricity rates; 
Whereas in 2020 nearly 4,800,000 low-income households in 
the United States live in a state of energy insecurity in 
which they were unable to afford their energy bill; 
Whereas there is a fundamental conflict when shareholder 
gains determine the prices and accessibility of funda-
mental public goods;

•HRES 457 IH 
Whereas there are limited avenues for legitimate public par-
ticipation, transparency, and community wealth-building 
from existing investor-owned utility business models and 
regulations; 
Whereas private monopolies and market-centric models have 
proven incapable of managing the transition to renewable 
energy at the pace and scale necessary to address the cli-
mate crisis, and without intention to repair harms of the 
fossil fueled system to Black, indigenous, people of color, 
and low-wealth communities; 
Whereas investor-owned utilities, fossil fuel energy companies, 
and their industry associations fund and coordinate ob-
struction of renewable energy policies and programs, in-
cluding rooftop and community solar requirements and 
incentives; 
Whereas many investor-owned utilities have a history of abus-
ing relationships with legislators and regulators and pro-
moting disinformation to maintain the status quo fossil 
fuel system and protect profits; 
Whereas investor-owned utilities and fossil fuel energy com-
panies valuations are based evaluating fossil fuel infra-
structure over time frames incompatible with planetary 
survival; 
Whereas some existing public and cooperative utilities have 
serious yet resolvable issues related to governance, regu-
lation, legacy debt, and climate impacts that must be ac-
knowledged and overcome to develop an effective and 
100-percent renewable public utility system; and 
Whereas truly public ownership of utilities would allow for 
improved oversight, accountability, high-road labor stand-
