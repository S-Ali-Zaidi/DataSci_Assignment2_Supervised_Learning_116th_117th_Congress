SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE. 
1
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following find-
2
ings: 
3
(1) Social determinants of health are the condi-
4
tions in which people are born, grow, live, play, work 
5
and age; they include factors like socioeconomic sta-
6
tus, education, housing, transportation, nutrition 
7
and literacy. 
8
(2) Research has shown that addressing social 
9
determinants of health is important for improving 
10
overall health and reducing health inequities. 
11
(3) Social determinants that negatively impact 
12
health can have harmful neurodevelopmental and bi-
13
ological consequences that develop in childhood and 
14
manifest in adulthood. 
15
(4) There is a growing body of evidence sug-
16
gesting that policies that specifically address social 
17
needs, including policies targeting children and fami-
18
lies, can improve community health outcomes and 
19
have the potential to reduce health care spending. 
20
(5) Some State Medicaid programs have begun 
21
testing innovative delivery and payment models de-
22
signed to improve health outcomes and reduce costs 
23
by implementing strategies to address social deter-
24
minants of health under existing Medicaid authori-
25
ties as well as through the use of waivers, though

•HR 3894 IH
payment incentives linked to social determinant of 
1
health are not common. 
2
(6) Despite a growing focus on social deter-
3
minants of health in State managed care contracts, 
4
most States do not provide necessary guidance for 
5
managed care organizations as to how they may use 
6
existing authority under Federal law to provide pa-
7
tients with services that can improve health by ad-
8
dressing social determinants. 
9
(7) Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 
10
guidance and technical assistance are critical tools 
11
that could increase adoption of strategies to address 
12
social determinants of health among State Medicaid 
13
agencies. 
14
(b) PURPOSES.—It is the purpose of this Act to pro-
15
vide States with additional operational clarity and exam-
16
ples of the strategies they can leverage through existing 
17
authority and waivers to address social determinants of 
18
health for the Medicaid population.
