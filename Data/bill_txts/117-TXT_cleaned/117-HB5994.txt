H5994
45 
•HR 5994 IH
(1) harassment is a persistent and significant 
1
problem in the workplace in the United States; 
2
(2) workers are harassed because of their sex 
3
(including sexual orientation, gender identity, preg-
4
nancy, childbirth, or a medical condition related to 
5
pregnancy or childbirth, and a sex stereotype), race, 
6
color, religion, national origin, age, disability, genetic 
7
information, and uniformed services status; 
8
(3) Congress enacted title VII of the Civil 
9
Rights Act of 1964 intending to provide broad pro-
10
tection from many forms of bias in the workplace; 
11
(4) the Supreme Court has recognized in City 
12
of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power v. 
13
Manhart, 435 U.S. 702 (1978), that the protection 
14
against sex discrimination in the terms, conditions, 
15
or privileges of employment under title VII of the 
16
Civil Rights Act of 1964 reflects Congress’ intent to 
17
‘‘strike at the entire spectrum’’ of sex-based dis-
18
crimination in employment; 
19
(5) in 1980, the Equal Employment Oppor-
20
tunity Commission (referred to in this section as 
21
‘‘the Commission’’) amended its Guidelines on Dis-
22
crimination Because of Sex (referred to in this sec-
23
tion as ‘‘the Guidelines’’) to specify that sexual har-
24

H5994
46 
•HR 5994 IH
assment is a form of sex discrimination prohibited 
1
by title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; 
2
(6) in the Guidelines, the Commission explained 
3
that harassing conduct is unlawful where— 
4
(A) ‘‘submission to such conduct is made 
5
either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition 
6
of an individual’s employment’’; 
7
(B) ‘‘submission to or rejection of such 
8
conduct by an individual is used as the basis for 
9
employment decisions’’; or 
10
(C) the conduct ‘‘has the purpose or effect 
11
of unreasonably interfering with an individual’s 
12
work performance or creating an intimidating, 
13
hostile, or offensive working environment’’; 
14
(7) the Commission further explained that, with 
15
respect to the evidence required to support a finding 
16
of unlawful harassment, it ‘‘will look at the record 
17
as a whole and at the totality of the circumstances, 
18
such as the nature of the sexual advances and the 
19
context in which the alleged incidents occurred’’ and 
20
emphasized that the ‘‘determination of the legality of 
21
a particular action will be made from the facts, on 
22
a case by case basis’’; 
23
(8) six years later, the Supreme Court in 
24

25
20:00 Nov 19, 2021
H5994

•HR 5994 IH
(1986), recognized that the protections under title 
1
VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 are not limited 
2
to discrimination that causes ‘‘economic’’ or ‘‘tan-
3
gible’’ loss, and held that the phrase ‘‘terms, condi-
4
tions, or privileges of employment’’ in title VII of 
5
such Act is an ‘‘expansive concept that sweeps with-
6
in its protective ambit’’ the practice of creating a 
7
hostile work environment based on discrimination in 
8
the form of harassment; 
9
(9) in reaching this conclusion in the Meritor 
10
decision, the Supreme Court cited and approved the 
11
Guidelines; 
12
(10) in the Meritor decision, the Supreme Court 
13
cited with approval lower court decisions that con-
14
cluded that a hostile work environment based on 
15
race, religion, or national origin violates the prohibi-
16
tion of discrimination in the terms, conditions, or 
17

18

4
(E) Cariddi v. Kansas City Chiefs Football 
5

6
(11) in defining the evidence required to prove 
7
a violation of title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 
8
1964, in the Meritor decision, the Supreme Court 
9
noted that harassment would be actionable when it 
10
is ‘‘sufficiently severe or pervasive ‘to alter the con-
11
ditions of [the victim’s] employment and create an 
12
abusive working environment’ ’’ (quoting Rogers v. 
13
EEOC, 454 F.2d 234 (5th Cir. 1971)); 
14
(12) in Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc., 510 
15
U.S. 17 (1993), the Supreme Court clarified that 
16
harassment need not seriously affect an employee’s 
17
psychological well-being or lead the employee to suf-
18
fer injury in order to be unlawful, but rather, need 
19
merely create a work environment that a reasonable 
20
person in the protected class would find hostile or 
21
abusive; 
22
(13) in Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc., the Su-
23
preme Court held that whether a work environment 
24
is unlawfully hostile or abusive does not depend on 
25
20:00 Nov 19, 2021
H5994
49 
•HR 5994 IH
any mathematically precise test, but rather, is to be 
1
determined by looking at all of the circumstances, 
2
with no single factor required; 
3
(14) in National Railroad Passenger Corp. v. 
4
Morgan, 536 U.S. 101 (2002), the Supreme Court 
5
reaffirmed the Harris decision and further held that 
6
the hostility or abusiveness of each harassing act 
7
should be considered in the aggregate, not in isola-
8
tion, regardless of whether such acts occur over days 
9
or even years; 
10
(15) notwithstanding the rulings of the Su-
11
preme Court specified in this subsection, some lower 
12
court decisions have treated harassing conduct’s se-
13
verity or pervasiveness as the only 2 relevant factors 
14
in evaluating whether such conduct violates title VII 
15
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; 
16
(16) some lower court decisions have treated 
17
‘‘severe or pervasive’’ as a threshold for liability, 
18
when the relevant inquiry is whether the harassing 
19
conduct actually altered the terms, conditions, or 
20
privileges of employment; 
21
(17) some lower court decisions further have in-
22
terpreted the ‘‘severe or pervasive’’ language in the 
23
Meritor decision so narrowly as to recognize only the 
24
most egregious conduct as unlawful, despite Con-

gress’ intent that title VII of the Civil Rights Act of

(18) examples of decisions that use the erro-

3
(20) in contrast, other lower court decisions ap-
4
plying the Meritor case and its progeny have appro-
5
priately recognized that a wide range of harassing

behavior may alter the terms, conditions, or privi-

8
or duration of conduct required to make a showing 
9
of severe or pervasive harassment; 
10
(21) for example, in the context of harassment 
11

12
(A) conduct need not be physical to create

•HR 5994 IH
(D) gender-based epithets were based on

was objectively hostile, as in Gallagher v. C.H.

Robinson Worldwide, Inc., 567 F.3d 263 (6th

9
(22) similarly, in the context of harassment 
10
based on other protected characteristics, other 
11

17
(B) repeatedly calling an individual with
