tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
00:15 Dec 07, 2022
H9390
2 
•HR 9390 IH
(1) Congress is dependent on providing discre-
1
tion to executive officials and agencies (including 
2
independent agencies) to implement its statutes. 
3
Congress provides appropriate oversight of the use 
4
of this discretion. 
5
(2) Regulatory legislation is often phrased in 
6
broad terms, with an intelligible principle, to em-
7
power agencies to address issues, such as those pre-
8
sented by technological, scientific, or social develop-
9
ments that were not precisely foreseen when the leg-
10
islation was enacted; and to draw upon the agency’s 
11
specialized knowledge, experience, and responsibility 
12
for implementing the statute. 
13
(3) Such broad authorizing language is often 
14
necessary to empower the administering agency to 
15
take effective action when new or unforeseen issues 
16
arise, provided that the rule does not exceed clear 
17
limits in statute nor implement it in an impermis-
18
sible manner. 
19
(4) A rule that an agency has adopted to imple-
20
ment a broadly worded regulatory statute should 
21
generally not be held to be invalid on the basis that 
22
Congress has not addressed the agency’s proposed 
23
course of action in specific terms. 
24

H9390

•HR 9390 IH
(5) A rule that an agency has adopted to imple-
1
ment a regulatory statute should generally not be 
2
held to be invalid on the basis that the agency has 
3
not previously adopted a similar rule or scheme of 
4
regulation. 
5
(6) The expectation that a rule will have broad 
6
economic, political, or social signficance, should not, 
7
standing alone, negate application of the principle 
8
stated in paragraph (1), (2), or (3). 
9
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
10
It is the sense of Congress that— 
11
(1) agency economic analyses of regulatory ac-
12
tions commonly underestimate the benefits of regu-
13
latory actions that protect public health and safety 
14
and overestimate the costs of regulatory action to in-
15
dustry; 
16
(2) agency regulatory actions often fail to ade-
17
quately consider the distributional effects and social 
18
equity impact of regulatory action; and 
19
(3) an agency shall prioritize the statutory di-
20
rection of Congress when taking regulatory action.
