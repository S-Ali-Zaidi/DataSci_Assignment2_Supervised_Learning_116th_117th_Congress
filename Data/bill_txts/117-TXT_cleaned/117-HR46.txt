RESOLUTION 
Removing Representative Mo Brooks from the House of 
Representatives. 
Whereas, before the Presidential election of 2020, President 
Donald J. Trump repeatedly claimed without cause that 
if he lost on November 3, 2020, it would be because of 
election fraud; 
Whereas, on November 3, 2020, voters went to the polls and, 
by a six-million vote majority and an Electoral College 
majority of 306 to 232, chose Joseph R. Biden to be the 
next President; 
Whereas, since November 3, 2020, President Trump has or-
chestrated, through both his own words and those of his

surrogates, a public relations misinformation campaign to 
convince the American people of the lie that the election 
was stolen from him and that he actually won the elec-
tion in a landslide; 
Whereas Representative Mo Brooks of Alabama has continu-
ously used his role as an elected official and presidential 
surrogate to publicly promote President Trump’s baseless 
and dangerous election theft narrative; 
Whereas Representative Brooks has baselessly alleged mas-
sive voter fraud in a safe, secure United States election 
in an attempt to overturn the valid results of that elec-
tion and deprive the American people of their right to 
choose their representatives in Congress and the White 
House; 
Whereas, on January 6, 2021, at a White House rally orga-
nized by supporters of the President and featuring Presi-
dent Trump himself, speakers repeatedly urged the thou-
sands present to march to the United States Capitol to 
‘‘stop the steal’’; 
Whereas, on the morning of Wednesday, January 6, 2021, 
Representative Mo Brooks gave a profanity-laden speech 
to an angry crowd of supporters of President Trump, in-
cluding language such as ‘‘Today is the day American pa-
triots start taking down names and kicking ass’’; 
Whereas, in this speech, Representative Brooks included the 
following incitement to violence: ‘‘Our ancestors sacrificed 
their blood, their sweat, their tears, their fortunes, some-
times their lives, to give us, their descendants, an Amer-
ica that is the greatest Nation in world history. So I have 
a question for you. Are you willing to do the same? My 
answer is yes. Louder, are you willing to do what it takes

to fight for America? Louder, will you fight for Amer-
ica?’’; 
Whereas Representative Brooks’ words and actions leading 
up to and including his speech on January 6, 2021, in-
cited insurrection in the hearts and minds of members of 
the crowd by encouraging them to believe baseless con-
spiracy theories about the Presidential election, by taking 
the stage after other speakers had encouraged the mob 
to march on the Capitol, and by encouraging them to ‘‘do 
what it takes to fight for America’’; 
Whereas, soon after those remarks, that crowd turned to 
march on the United States Capitol, seizing control of 
the Capitol, damaging government property, and endan-
gering the lives of the Vice President, Speaker Pelosi, 
Members of Congress, and the staff working in the build-
ings; 
Whereas members of the insurrectionist mob looking for 
Members of Congress were found with tactical gear de-
signed for taking prisoners, including plastic handcuffs, 
bear spray, and other weapons; 
Whereas a United States Capitol Police officer was killed by 
the mob during the assault on the Capitol and another 
lost his life as a result of this attack; 
Whereas Representative Brooks has refused to apologize and 
doubled down on this hateful rhetoric; and 
Whereas Representative Brooks has repeatedly and baselessly 
blamed others, including unnamed fascists, rather than 
accept responsibility for the weight of his words as a 
leader: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That Representative Mo Brooks of Alabama 
1
is using the power of his office to subvert the will of the

bring dishonor to the House of Representatives; and
