ma informed services that address the needs of 
marginalized students and improve academic outcomes, 
and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Over the last 50 years, our Nation’s schools 
3
have become sites for increased criminalization and 
4
surveillance of young people, particularly Black, Na-
5
tive American, and Latino students, immigrant stu-
6
dents, students with disabilities, LGBTQ students, 
7
students experiencing homelessness, students in-
8
volved in the foster care system, and other histori-
9
cally marginalized students. 
10
(2) Despite significant decreases in the rate of 
11
serious crimes and violence on school campuses over 
12
the past 20 years, improving upon already low rates, 
13
67 percent of high school students, 45 percent of 
14
middle school students, and 19 percent of elemen-
15
tary school students attend a school with a police of-
16
ficer. 
17
(3) Since 1999, the Federal Government has in-
18
vested more than $1,000,000,000 to subsidize the 
19
placement of police in schools, resulting in roughly 
20
46,000 school resource officers patrolling the halls of 
21
elementary and secondary public schools across the 
22
Nation. 
23
(4) A growing body of research has not found 
24
any evidence that school resource officers make 
25
schools safer, and school resource officers have been 
26
16:53 Jul 20, 2021
H4011
3 
•HR 4011 IH
shown to increase the likelihood that children will be 
1
arrested, often by the school resource officer while 
2
on campus. 
3
(5) Research has shown that schools with a des-
4
ignated school law enforcement officer on duty ar-
5
rested students at 5 times the rate of comparable 
6
schools without such an officer. 
7
(6) When police are present in schools, students 
8
of color face an increased risk of being assaulted by 
9
police. Student-recorded videos of police violence in 
10
schools regularly circulate through news channels, 
11
articles, and social media, exposing violence per-
12
petrated by police within schoolhouse gates. 
13
(7) Black, Native American, and Latino stu-
14
dents are more likely than their white peers to at-
15
tend schools with police officers on campus and are 
16
more likely to be referred to law enforcement or ar-
17
rested while in school. 
18
(8) Black students represent 31 percent of all 
19
school-related arrests, despite making up only 15 
20
percent of all public school students, and are 3 times 
21
more likely to be suspended or expelled than white 
22
students. Native American and Pacific Islander and 
23
Native Hawaiian students are more than twice as 
24
likely to be arrested as white students. 
25

•HR 4011 IH
(9) Students with disabilities are more likely 
1
than their peers without disabilities to be referred to 
2
law enforcement or arrested. Students of color with 
3
disabilities are more likely to be referred to law en-
4
forcement than either their white peers with disabil-
5
ities, or their peers of color without disabilities. 
6
These students are also disproportionately restrained 
7
and secluded in schools. Of the 87,000 students who 
8
were restrained during the 2015–2016 school year, 
9
71 percent received special education services and 27 
10
percent of students restrained were Black. 
11
(10) According to the Department of Edu-
12
cation, while Black girls comprise only 16 percent of 
13
girls in elementary and secondary schools, they make 
14
up 42 percent of girls receiving the most severe 
15
forms of school discipline and severe punishment, 
16
such as corporal punishment, and represent 34 per-
17
cent of girls arrested on campus. 
18
(11) Research shows that these racial dispari-
19
ties in discipline rates are not a result of differences 
20
in student behavior but instead reflect the ways in 
21
which students of color face more punitive discipline 
22
than their white peers for similar behavior. 
23
(12) Students who are LGBTQ often have 
24
intersecting marginalized identities and experience 
25
16:53 Jul 20, 2021
H4011
5 
•HR 4011 IH
exclusionary discipline at disproportionate rates that 
1
make it more likely they will interact with the juve-
2
nile justice system than their non-LGBTQ peers. 
3
(13) Students who are suspended or expelled 
4
are nearly threefold more likely to be in contact with 
5
the juvenile justice system the following year. 
6
(14) According to the Federal Bureau of Inves-
7
tigation, more than 30,000 children under the age of 
8
10 were arrested since 2013. On school campuses, 
9
more than 290,000 students were referred to law en-
10
forcement. The United States spends $240 daily, on 
11
average, per youth detained in juvenile facilities. 
12
(15) While schools should be sanctuaries for all 
13
students, reports have shown instances where school 
14
resource officers collect tips and disciplinary infor-
15
mation from teachers and school administrators and 
16
share it with U.S. Immigration and Customs En-
17
forcement agents to build deportation cases against 
18
students and their families. 
19
(16) School hardening, including the presence 
20
of school resource officers on campus, causes stu-
21
dents to experience higher levels of fear, perpetuate 
22
the school to prison pipeline, and undermine the 
23
ability of schools and educators to build learning en-
24

•HR 4011 IH
vironments undergirded by mutual trust, respect, 
1
and safety. 
2
(17) Ninety percent of students are in public 
3
schools where the number of counselors, social work-
4
ers, nurses, and psychologists do not meet rec-
5
ommended 
professional 
standards. 
Professional 
6
standards recommend at least 1 counselor and 1 so-
7
cial worker for every 250 students and at least 1 
8
nurse and 1 psychologist for every 750 students and 
9
every 700 students, respectively. 
10
(18) 1,700,000 students attend schools with po-
11
lice but not 1 counselor. 
12
(19) 3,000,000 students attend schools with po-
13
lice but not 1 school nurse. 
14
(20) 6,000,000 students attend schools with po-
15
lice but no school psychologists. 
16
(21) 10,000,000 students attend schools with 
17
police but no social workers.

20
(1) address the needs of marginalized students, 
21
