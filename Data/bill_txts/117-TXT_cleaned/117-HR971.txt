RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
corporations should commit to utilizing the benefits of 
gender diversity in boards of directors and other senior 
management positions. 
Whereas Catalyst, a non-profit and non-partisan organiza-
tion, found in their 2020 report entitled ‘‘Women on Cor-
porate Boards’’ that women are 56 percent of the labor 
force, yet only account for 30 percent of board directors 
of S&P 500 companies, and another Catalyst report enti-
tled ‘‘Women CEOs of the S&P 500’’ found that women 
accounted for only 6 percent of all CEOs in 2020; 
Whereas a McKinsey report entitled ‘‘Women in the Work-
place’’ published in 2021, found that women of color con-

tinue to have even lower representation at every level of 
corporate employment and leadership; 
Whereas the Sadie Collective’s paper titled ‘‘Why are Black 
Women Missing from Corporate Leadership?’’ published 
in November 2020 showed that the number of Black 
women completing degrees in economics, finance, ac-
counting, and math fields is declining, which are often 
fields associated with corporate leadership; 
Whereas such study found that measures to remove barriers 
to the pipeline of corporate leadership for Black women 
in male-dominated fields include access to information, 
earlier education, and exposure to female mentors; 
Whereas The American Economic Association’s study entitled 
‘‘AEA Profession Climate Survey: Final Report’’ pub-
lished in September 2019 found that women, especially 
Black women, had to take the most measures to avoid 
possible harassment, discrimination and unfair treatment, 
hindering efforts to climb the corporate ladder; 
Whereas an Egon Zehnder study entitled ‘‘Global Board Di-
versity Tracker: Who’s Really on Board?’’ published in 
December 2020, showed that companies with more di-
verse executive teams and boards of directors perform 
better financially; 
Whereas such study showed that women directors contribute 
to important corporate-level outcomes because they play 
roles as leaders and mentors, as well as indirect roles as 
symbols of opportunity for other women, and inspire 
those women to achieve and stay with their corporations; 
Whereas such study found that more recognition of the valu-
able contribution of women directors to corporation value 
is needed;

Whereas such study showed that corporations need a critical 
mass of at least 3 women serving on boards of directors 
with average membership of 11 individuals to access the 
benefits of diversity for overall organizational perform-
ance and prevent the negative impacts of tokenism on 
leadership teams; 
Whereas a Harvard Business study entitled ‘‘An Institutional 
Approach to Gender Diversity and Firm Performance’’ 
published in 2019 found that increased gender diversity 
results in more productive companies in terms of market 
value and revenue; 
Whereas Credit Suisse’s global research study entitled ‘‘CS 
Gender 3000’’ published in October 2019 reviewed 3,000 
corporations worldwide to find that women serving on 
corporate boards improved corporation performance with 
respect to key metrics, including stock performance, and 
that companies with a higher proportion of women senior 
managers demonstrated returns on investment that were 
both higher and more stable overall; 
Whereas such study found that corporations with women 
serving as directors tend to be somewhat risk-averse and 
carry less debt, on average, compared to corporations 
with no women directors, and that net income growth for 
such corporations was also higher; and 
Whereas a Stanford University study entitled ‘‘Do Investors 
Value Gender Diversity in Firms?’’ released in 2019 
found that investors react positively to substantive in-
creases in gender diversity with a significant increase in 
stock prices following corporate announcements regarding 
increased diversity, demonstrating the economic con-
sequences of increased diversity: Now, therefore, be it
