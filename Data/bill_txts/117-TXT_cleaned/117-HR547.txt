Whereas women and girls in Afghanistan suffered enormous 
anguish under Taliban rule; 
Whereas the Taliban government brutally oppressed women, 
including by prohibiting women and girls from attending 
school, banning women from working, and perpetrating 
egregious acts of violence such as rape; 
Whereas, following the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan and 
subsequent overthrow of the Taliban government, oppor-
tunities for women in Afghanistan have dramatically im-
proved; 
Whereas Afghan women are now able to vote, attend school, 
work, and run for elected office; 
Whereas Afghan women have assumed leadership roles such 
as ministers, provincial governors, judges, police officers, 
members of Parliament, and journalists, and are an im-
portant part of Afghan civil society; 
Whereas Afghan women and girls tragically remain targets of 
violence, recently illustrated on May 8, 2021, when ter-
rorists killed at least 85 people and wounded more than 
100 people in three explosions near a high school for girls 
in Kabul; 
Whereas the Taliban’s history of brutality against women and 
the absence of significant female representation through-
out negotiations have created concern for the future of 
women in Afghanistan; and 
Whereas President Biden has pledged the United States will 
‘‘continue to support the rights of Afghan women and 
girls by maintaining significant humanitarian and devel-
opment assistance’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
