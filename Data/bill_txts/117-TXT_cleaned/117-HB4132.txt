8
(2) whether the implementation, compliance, 
9
administration, enforcement, imposition of unfunded 
10
mandates, or other costs of the major rule or set of

major rules to the economy are not justified by the 
12
benefits to society within the United States produced 
13
by the expenditure of those costs; 
14

15
has been rendered unnecessary or obsolete, taking

5
rule or set of major rules;

has excessive compliance costs, user fees, imposes 
10
unfunded mandates, or is otherwise excessively bur-
11
densome, as compared to alternatives that— 
12

13
than conduct or manners of compliance; 
14
(B) establish economic incentives to en-
15
courage desired behavior;

information
