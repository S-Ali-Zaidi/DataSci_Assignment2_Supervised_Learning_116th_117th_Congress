A BILL 
To require the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforce-
ment to further develop, finalize, and implement updated 
regulations for offshore oil and gas pipelines to address 
long-standing limitations regarding its ability to ensure 
active pipeline integrity and address safety and environ-
mental risks associated with decommissioning, and for 
other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

Not later than 18 months after the date of enactment

of this Act, the Secretary of the Interior, acting through

the Director of the Bureau of Safety and Environmental 
5
Enforcement, shall issue final regulations relating to Oil 
6
and Gas and Sulphur Operations in the Outer Continental 
7
Shelf—Pipelines and Pipeline Rights-of-Way (72 Fed. 
8
Reg. 56,442 (Oct. 3, 2007)). Such regulations shall re-
9
quire owners of oil and gas pipelines subject to such regu-
10
lations— 
11
(1) to provide for internal and external inspec-
12
tions of pipelines by a third-party no less frequently 
13
than every two years, unless the Director of the Bu-
14
reau determines that any such inspection is not re-
15
quired; and 
16
(2) to equip such pipelines with a leak detection 
17
system or device that provides continuous volumetric 
18
comparison between the pipeline’s product input and 
19
output and includes alarms and adequate sensitivity 
20
to detect variations between input and discharge vol-
21
umes to enable any leaks from the pipeline to be de-
22
tected as quickly as possible.

(a) STUDY ON ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS OF DECOM-

MISSIONING PIPELINES VERSUS REMOVING PIPELINES.— 
4
(1) STUDY.—The Directors of the Bureau of 
5
Safety and Environmental Enforcement and the Bu-
6
reau of Ocean Energy Management shall jointly con-
7
duct a study to evaluate the environmental risks as-
8
sociated with decommissioning oil and gas pipelines 
9
in place on the sea floor compared to removing such 
10
pipelines. Such study shall include— 
11
(A) an evaluation of pipelines that have 
12
been decommissioned in place, identifying de-
13
commissioned pipelines at high-risk of causing 
14
safety and environmental harm, causing ob-
15
structions, or otherwise unduly interfering with 
16
present or future uses of the outer continental

shelf; and 
18
(B) recommendations on the best uses of 
19
the revenues generated by the annual pipelines

(2) REPORT.—Not later than 18 months after

(b) REQUIRED CONSIDERATIONS IN REVIEWING DE-
4
COMMISSIONING APPLICATIONS.—In determining whether 
5
to permit an owner to decommission an oil or gas pipeline, 
6
the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, 
7
shall fully consider whether the offshore oil and gas pipe-
8
line constitutes a hazard to navigation and commercial 
9
fishing operations, unduly interferes with other uses of the 
10
outer continental shelf, or has adverse environmental ef-
11
fects.

(c) ONGOING MONITORING
OF DECOMMISSIONED 
13
PIPELINES.—The Bureau of Safety and Environmental 
14
Enforcement shall continually monitor the condition and 
15
location of all oil and gas pipelines that have been decom-
16
missioned and remain in place, and shall maintain all rel-
17
evant records of such monitoring. 
18
(d) ANNUAL PIPELINE OWNERS FEE.—Not later 
19
than 180 after the date of enactment of this Act, the Bu-
20
reau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement shall issue 
21
regulations to assess an annual fee on owners of offshore 
22
oil and gas pipelines for the purpose of providing the Bu-
23
reau with funds to decommission or remove such pipelines

in the event an owner files for bankruptcy. Such fee shall

be no less than—

(1) $10,000 per mile for such pipelines in water

with a depth of 500 feet or greater; and

of under 500 feet.

If the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforce-
9
ment identifies any exposed segment of any active or de-
10
commissioned pipeline, the Bureau shall either remove the 
11
pipeline from the ocean or ensure it is properly decommis-
12
sioned and does not pose a threat. If a segment of any 
13
active pipeline is exposed or shifts, the Bureau shall re- 
14
secure such segment to the sea floor.

(a) COMPLETION OF STUDY.—The Bureau of Safety 
19
and Environmental Enforcement shall complete a study 
20
addressing the risks to the environment of chemical prod-
21
ucts used in oil and gas operations including umbilical 
22
lines. In conducting the study, the Bureau shall seek input
