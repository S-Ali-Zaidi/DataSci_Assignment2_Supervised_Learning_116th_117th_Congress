SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
3
Congress makes the following findings: 
4
(1) Semiconductors underpin the United States 
5
and global economies, including manufacturing sec-
6
tors. Semiconductors are also essential to the na-
7
tional security of the United States. 
8
(2) A shortage of semiconductors, brought 
9
about by the COVID–19 pandemic and other com-
10
plex factors impacting the overall supply chain, has 
11
threatened the economic recovery of the United 
12
States and industries that employ millions of United 
13
States citizens. 
14
(3) Addressing current challenges and building 
15
resilience against future risks requires ensuring a se-
16
cure and stable supply chain for semiconductors that 
17
will support the economic and national security 
18
needs of the United States and its allies. 
19
(4) The supply chain for semiconductors is 
20
complex and global. While the United States plays 
21
a leading role in certain segments of the semicon-
22
ductor industry, securing the supply chain requires 
23
onshoring, reshoring, or diversifying vulnerable seg-
24
ments, such as for—

(A) fabrication; 
1
(B) advanced packaging; and 
2
(C) materials and equipment used to man-
3
ufacture semiconductor products. 
4
(5) The Federal Government can leverage for-
5
eign direct investment and private dollars to grow 
6
the domestic manufacturing and production capacity 
7
of the United States for vulnerable segments of the 
8
semiconductor supply chain. 
9
(6) The SelectUSA program of the Department 
10
of Commerce, in coordination with other Federal 
11
agencies and State-level economic development orga-
12
nizations, is positioned to boost foreign direct invest-
13
ment in domestic manufacturing and to help secure 
14
the semiconductor supply chain of the United States.

SEC. 4. COORDINATION WITH STATE-LEVEL ECONOMIC DE-
16
VELOPMENT ORGANIZATIONS. 
17
Not later than 180 days after the date of the enact-
18
ment of this Act, the Executive Director of SelectUSA 
19
shall solicit comments from State-level economic develop-
20
ment organizations—

lated production; 
2
(B) what barriers to such investment may

exist and how to amplify State efforts to attract 
4
such investment; 
5
(C) public opportunities those organiza-
6
tions have identified to attract foreign direct in-
7
vestment to help increase investment described 
8
in subparagraph (A); and 
9
(D) resource gaps or other challenges that 
10
prevent those organizations from increasing 
11
such investment; and 
12
(2) to develop recommendations for— 
13
(A) how SelectUSA can increase such in-
14
vestment independently or through partnership 
15
with those organizations; and 
16
(B) working with countries that are allies 
17
or partners of the United States to ensure that 
18
foreign adversaries (as defined in section 
19
8(c)(2) of the Secure and Trusted Communica-
20
tions Networks Act of 2019 (47 U.S.C. 
21
1607(c)(2))) do not benefit from United States
