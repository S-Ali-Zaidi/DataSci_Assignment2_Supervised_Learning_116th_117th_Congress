1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 2. PURPOSE AND FINDINGS. 
1
(a) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act is to provide 
2
grants to States, units of local government, and Indian 
3
Tribes to reform their criminal justice system to encour-
4
age the replacement of the use of payment of money bail 
5
as a condition of pretrial release in criminal cases. 
6
(b) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) The justice system of the United States, a 
8
cornerstone of our free society, is built on the ideals 
9
that all accused people are presumed innocent unless 
10
and until proven guilty, that all accused people have 
11
the right to assert their innocence in a trial, that lib-
12
erty should not be denied absent due process of law, 
13
that rich and poor people should be treated equally, 
14
and that people should be judged by their own indi-
15
vidual actions, and not prejudged based on the ac-
16
tions of others. 
17
(2) Pretrial detention and the money bail sys-
18
tems prevalent in most States undermine these 
19
ideals by jailing people unnecessarily before a find-
20
ing of guilt and with minimal due process, and by 
21
establishing a system that allows wealthy people to 
22
pay for their liberty, while poor people remain in 
23
jail. 
24
21:55 May 26, 2021
H2152

•HR 2152 IH
(3) The inability to post money bail may result 
1
in innocent people pleading guilty to low-level crimes 
2
they did not commit so they can be released. 
3
(4) Money bail systems have resulted in dis-
4
parate harms to poor people and communities of 
5
color. Compared to white men charged with the 
6
same crime and with the same criminal histories, Af-
7
rican-American men receive bail amounts that are 
8
35 percent higher, and for Latino men, bail is set 
9
19 percent higher than for white men. 
10
(5) African Americans are 24 percent more 
11
likely to be denied bail and 21 percent less likely to 
12
be granted non-financial release than whites with 
13
similar legal characteristics. Latinos are 25 percent 
14
less likely to be granted nonfinancial conditions of 
15
release. 
16
(6) Although most women in jail are charged 
17
with nonviolent crimes, women are less likely to be 
18
able to afford money bail, and women in jail before 
19
trial earn scarcely more per year than the average 
20
bail amount of $10,000. 
21
(7) Detaining people who would otherwise be 
22
highly likely to succeed in pretrial compliance, even 
23
just for a few days, is strongly correlated with high-
24
21:55 May 26, 2021
H2152
4 
•HR 2152 IH
er rates of new criminal activity both during the pre-
1
trial period and years after case disposition. 
2
(8) When held for 2 to 3 days, people who 
3
would have been highly likely to succeed in their 
4
communities are almost 40 percent more likely to be 
5
arrested for new crimes before trial than similarly 
6
situated defendants held no more than 24 hours. 
7
(9) Court reminder programs are a low-cost, 
8
highly effective way of improving court appearance 
9
rates. One review of different forms of court remind-
10
ers found failure-to-appear rates were reduced by 23 
11
to 43 percent with the use of reminders. 
12
(10) Pretrial supervision is most effective for 
13
people with a decreased probability of appearing in 
14
court, reducing failures to appear by 33 to 38 per-
15
cent. 
16
(11) Jailing individuals before trial is the great-
17
est expense generated by current pretrial justice 
18
practice. Unconvicted detainees account for 95 per-
19
cent of jail population growth, nationally, since 
20
2000. 
Taxpayers 
now 
spend 
approximately 
21
$38,000,000 per day to jail individuals who are 
22
awaiting 
trial. 
Annually, 
this 
adds 
up 
to 
23
$14,000,000,000 used to detain individuals.
