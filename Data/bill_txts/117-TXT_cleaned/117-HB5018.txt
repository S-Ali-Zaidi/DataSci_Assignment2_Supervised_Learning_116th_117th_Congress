SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Wealth inequality is steadily rising in the 
3
United States. As the disparities between the richest 
4
Americans and the poorest Americans widen, White 
5
Americans have grown disproportionately wealthier, 
6
while the median wealth of Black Americans has 
7
stagnated. 
8
(2) In 1968, and with the amounts adjusted for 
9
inflation, the median middle-class Black household 
10
had $6,674 in wealth, while the median middle-class 
11
White household had $70,786 in wealth. In 2016, 
12
the typical middle-class Black household had 
13
$13,024 in wealth compared to $149,703 for the 
14
median White household. 
15
(3) As of 2019, the typical White family has 
16
eight times the wealth of the typical Black family 
17
and five times the wealth of the typical Hispanic 
18
family. 
19
(4) As of 2019, White families have the highest 
20
level of both median wealth: $188,200. Black fami-
21
lies’ median and mean wealth is less than 15 percent 
22
that of White families, at $24,100. Hispanic fami-
23
lies’ median and mean wealth is $36,100. 
24
(5) As of 2019, families who are Asian, Amer-
25
ican Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, or Pa-
26

•HR 5018 IH
cific Islander have lower wealth than White families, 
1
but higher wealth than Black and Hispanic families. 
2
(6) The family income gap between Black and 
3
White Americans today remains at almost exactly 
4
the level it was in the 1960s. 
5
(7) In 2016, the median annual income for 
6
Asian American adults was $51,288, compared with 
7
$47,958 for White Americans, $31,082 for African 
8
Americans, and $30,400 for Hispanic Americans. 
9
(8) As of the last quarter of 2019, the median 
10
White worker made 28 percent more than the typical 
11
Black worker and more than 35 percent more than 
12
the median Latinx worker. 
13
(9) On average, women are paid 82 cents for 
14
every dollar paid to men. For every dollar paid to 
15
White men, Black women are paid 63 cents, Native 
16
American women are paid 60 cents, and Latinas are 
17
paid 55 cents. 
18
(10) Asian American and Pacific Islander 
19
(AAPI) women make 85 cents for every dollar paid 
20
to White men, and different groups within America’s 
21
AAPI community have unique experiences with eco-
22
nomic discrimination. For example, between 2015 
23
and 2019, Hmong women earned 60 cents for every 
24
dollar paid to White men.

(11) Disparities in wealth between genders are 
1
even more stark. As of 2013, the average wealth for 
2
working single women was $3,210, whereas the sin-
3
gle working man had a median wealth of $10,150. 
4
Single Black women had a median wealth of $200, 
5
and single Hispanic women had a median wealth of 
6
$100: less than a penny for every dollar of wealth 
7
owned by single White non-Hispanic men. 
8
(12) The COVID–19 pandemic has exacerbated 
9
existing inequalities in America. Many longstanding 
10
economic conditions, such as lower levels of income 
11
and wealth and higher levels of housing and food in-
12
security, leave individuals of color, particularly 
13
women of color and Black women, with less cushion, 
14
making them more vulnerable during the COVID–19 
15
economic crisis. 
16
(13) Informed and well-designed policies are 
17
needed to curb the growing inequality between 
18
Americans of different races and income levels. In 
19
order to meet this need, Congress needs access to 
20
standardized, reliable information about the socio-
21
economic consequences of the legislation it enacts.
