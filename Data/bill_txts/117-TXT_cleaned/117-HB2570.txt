•HR 2570 IH
(1) climate change poses a significant and in-
1
creasing threat to the growth and stability of the 
2
economy of the United States; 
3
(2) many sectors of the economy of the United 
4
States and many American businesses are exposed 
5
to climate-related risk, which may include exposure 
6
to— 
7
(A) the physical impacts of climate change, 
8
including the rise of the average global tem-
9
perature, accelerating sea-level rise, desertifica-
10
tion, ocean acidification, intensification of 
11
storms, increase in heavy precipitation, more 
12
frequent and intense temperature extremes, 
13
more severe droughts, and longer wildfire sea-
14
sons; 
15
(B) the economic disruptions and security 
16
threats that result from the physical impacts 
17
described in subparagraph (A) including con-
18
flicts over scarce resources, conditions condu-
19
cive to violent extremism, the spread of infec-
20
tious diseases, and forced migration;

(C) the transition impacts that result as 
22
the global economy transitions to a clean and 
23

sil fuel assets becoming stranded and it be-
1
comes uneconomic for companies to develop fos-
2
sil fuel assets as policymakers act to limit the 
3
worst impacts of climate change by keeping the 
4
rise in average global temperature to 1.5 de-
5
grees Celsius above pre-industrial levels; and 
6
(D) actions by Federal, State, Tribal, and 
7
local governments to limit the worst effects of 
8
climate change by enacting policies that keep 
9
the global average surface temperature rise to 
10
1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels; 
11
(3) assessing the potential impact of climate-re-
12
lated risks on national and international financial 
13
systems is an urgent concern; 
14
(4) companies have a duty to disclose financial 
15
risks that climate change presents to their investors, 
16
lenders, and insurers; 
17
(5) the Commission has a duty to promote a 
18
risk-informed securities market that is worthy of the 
19
trust of the public as families invest for their fu-
20
tures; 
21
(6) investors, lenders, and insurers are increas-
22
ingly demanding climate risk information that is 
23
consistent, comparable, reliable, and clear;

change risk and opportunity disclosure that is useful 
2
for decision makers in annual reports to the Com-
3
mission will increase transparency with respect to 
4
risk accumulation and exposure in financial markets; 
5
(8) requiring companies to disclose climate-re-
6
lated risk exposure and risk management strategies 
7
will encourage a smoother transition to a clean and 
8
renewable energy, low-emissions economy and guide 
9
capital allocation to mitigate, and adapt to, the ef-
10
fects of climate change and limit damages associated 
11
with climate-related events and disasters; and 
12
(9) a critical component in fighting climate 
13
change is a transparent accounting of the risks that 
14
climate change presents and the implications of con-
15
tinued inaction with respect to climate change.
