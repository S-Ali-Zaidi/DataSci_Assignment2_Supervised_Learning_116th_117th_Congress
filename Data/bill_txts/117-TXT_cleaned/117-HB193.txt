SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2

5
States. 
6
(2) According to an independent task force re-
7
port by the Atlantic Council’s Latin America Cen-

12
ruption as widespread; 
13
(C) citizens in El Salvador, Guatemala, 
14
and Honduras do not trust the government in-
15
stitutions responsible for curtailing corruption; 
16
and 
17
(D) investigations have revealed massive 
18
networks dedicated to co-opting public funds for 
19
the personal enrichment of government officials. 
20
(3) There exists the potential for foreign assist-
21
ance from the United States to be misused by cen-
22
tral government officials in El Salvador, Guatemala,

24
