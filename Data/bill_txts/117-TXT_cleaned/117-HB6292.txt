A BILL 
To direct the Department of Defense to report to Congress 
on the potential integration of advanced propulsion sys-
tems into F–35 aircraft, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. FINDINGS. 
3
Congress finds the following: 
4
(1) Fighter propulsion is one of the few areas 
5
in which the United States maintains a clear advan-
6
tage over near-peer adversaries, specifically China 
7
and its threat to the Indo-Pacific region.

(2) The F–35 will be one of the key elements 
1
of the frontline fighter forces of the military services 
2
and United States allies and partners for decades to 
3
come. 
4
(3) Failure to develop an adaptive cycle engine 
5
and make it available for production on the F–35 
6
would constitute a missed opportunity and open a 
7
door for United States adversaries to overtake field-
8
ed engine technology. 
9
(4) Maintaining a strong industrial base and 
10
competition is critical to supporting the National 
11
Defense Strategy.

13
TION STRATEGY FOR THE F–35A AIRCRAFT. 
14
(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 90 days after the 
15
date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the 
16
Air Force, in consultation with the Under Secretary of De-
17
fense for Acquisition and Sustainment, shall submit to the 
18
congressional defense committees a report on the integra-
19
tion of the Adaptive Engine Transition Program propul-
20
sion system into the F–35A aircraft. 
21
(b) ELEMENTS.—The report required under sub-
22
section (a) shall include the following: 
23
(1) A competitive acquisition strategy, informed 
24
by fiscal considerations, to—

(A) integrate the Adaptive Engine Transi-
1
tion Program propulsion system into the F–35A 
2
aircraft; and 
3
(B) begin, in fiscal year 2027, activities to 
4
retrofit all F–35A aircraft with such propulsion 
5
system. 
6
(2) An implementation plan to implement such 
7
strategy. 
8
(3) A schedule annotating pertinent milestones 
9
and yearly fiscal resource requirements for the im-
10
plementation of such strategy.

CRAFT. 
14
(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 90 days after the 
15
date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the 
16
Navy, in consultation with the Under Secretary of Defense 
17
for Acquisition and Sustainment, shall submit to the con-
18
gressional defense committees a report on the integration 
19
of an advanced propulsion system into F–35B and F–35C 
20
aircraft. 
21
(b) ELEMENTS.—The report required under sub-
22
section (a) shall include the following: 
23
(1) An analysis of the effects of an advanced 
24
propulsion system on the combat effectiveness and

sustainment costs of F–35B and F–35C aircraft, in-
1
cluding any effects resulting from— 
2
(A) increased thrust, fuel efficiency, ther-
3
mal capacity, and electrical generation; and 
4
(B) improvements in acceleration, speed, 
5
range, and overall mission effectiveness. 
6
(2) An assessment of how the integration of an 
7
advanced propulsion system may result in— 
8
(A) a reduction in dependency on support 
9
assets, including air refueling and replenish-
10
ment tankers; and 
11
(B) an overall cost benefit to the Depart-
12
ment from reduced acquisition and sustainment 
13
for such support assets. 
14
(3) A competitive acquisition strategy informed 
15
by fiscal considerations, the assessment of combat 
16
effectiveness under paragraph (1), and consideration 
17
of technical limitations— 
18
(A) to integrate an advanced propulsion 
19
system into F–35B aircraft and F–35C air-
20
craft; 
21
(B) to begin, not later than fiscal year 
22
2027, activities to produce all F–35B aircraft 
23
and all F–35C aircraft with such propulsion 
24
systems; and

and all F–35C aircraft with such propulsion 
3
systems.

(c) ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEM DEFINED.—In 
5
this section, term ‘‘advanced propulsion system’’ means— 
6
(1) a derivative of the propulsion system devel-
7
oped for the F–35 aircraft under the Adaptive En-
8
gine Transition Program of the Air Force; or 
9
(2) a derivative of a propulsion system pre-
10
viously developed for the F–35 aircraft.
