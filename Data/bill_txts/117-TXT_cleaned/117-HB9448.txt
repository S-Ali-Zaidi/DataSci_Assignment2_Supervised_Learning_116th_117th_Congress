A BILL 
To prohibit the Federal Government from taking certain 
action relating to social media companies, and for other 
purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Free Speech Defense 
4
Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 9448 IH
(1) The First Amendment guarantees freedoms 
1
concerning religion, expression, assembly, and peti-
2
tion of the government. The First Amendment guar-
3
antees the freedom of expression by prohibiting the 
4
government from restricting the press or the right of 
5
an individual to speak freely. The First Amendment 
6
also guarantees the right of an individual to assem-
7
ble peaceably and to petition the government. 
8
(2) The Fourth Amendment states that each in-
9
dividual is secure from unreasonable searches and 
10
seizures of property by the government. The Fourth 
11
Amendment protects against arbitrary arrests, wire-
12
taps, and other forms of surveillance conducted with-
13
out a search warrant. 
14
(3) In July 2021, the White House press sec-
15
retary, Jen Psaki, admitted that the White House 
16
was working with social media companies to identify 
17
‘‘misinformation.’’ 
18
(4) Specifically, Psaki said, ‘‘[W]e’re regularly 
19
making sure social media platforms are aware of the 
20
latest narratives, dangerous to public health that we 
21
and many other Americans are seeing across all of 
22
social and traditional media.’’. Psaki also said, 
23
‘‘[W]e work to engage with them to better under-
24

•HR 9448 IH
stand the enforcement of social media platform poli-
1
cies.’’. 
2
(5) 286 pages of documents produced in July 
3
2022 by the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
4
vention, in response to a Freedom of Information 
5
Act request submitted by the America First Legal 
6
Foundation, revealed shocking information, includ-
7
ing the following: 
8
(A) The Centers for Disease Control and 
9
Prevention sent to officials of Twitter a chart 
10
of tweets that the Centers for Disease Control 
11
and Prevention determined to be ‘‘misinforma-
12
tion’’. 
13
(B) The Centers for Disease Control and 
14
Prevention held regular BOLO (Be On The 
15
Lookout) meetings in which the Centers for 
16
Disease Control and Prevention would share 
17
with social media companies, including Twitter 
18
and Facebook, what the Centers for Disease 
19
Control and Prevention determined to be ‘‘mis-
20
information’’. In the meetings, the Centers for 
21
Disease Control and Prevention would provide 
22
slide decks requesting, among other things, 
23
‘‘[p]lease do not share outside your trust and 
24
safety teams’’.

•HR 9448 IH
(C) The Centers for Disease Control and 
1
Prevention recommended to Twitter that infor-
2
mation about the Vaccine Adverse Event Re-
3
porting System be added to tweets. 
4
(D) Officials from the Centers for Disease 
5
Control and Prevention directly engaged with 
6
Facebook, requesting that Facebook flag cer-
7
tain posts as disinformation and ensure that 
8
‘‘verifiable 
information 
sources’’ 
were 
not 
9
blocked because posts on Facebook by State 
10
Health Departments were being blocked as vac-
11
cine misinformation. 
12
(E) The Centers for Disease Control and 
13
Prevention created a COVID–19 Misinforma-
14
tion Reporting Channel for the Centers for Dis-
15
ease Control and Prevention and the Census 
16
Bureau to make reports to Facebook and held 
17
a ‘‘training meeting’’ about the Misinformation 
18
Reporting Channel. 
19
(F) $15,000,000 of Facebook advertising 
20
credits were provided to the Centers for Disease 
21
Control and Prevention and the Department of 
22
Health and Human Services as a ‘‘non-mone-
23
tary 
gift’’ 
to 
promote 
vaccines, 
social 
24
distancing, travel, and priority communication

messages, which may have violated the limita-
1
tion on voluntary services described in section 
2
1342 of the Antideficiency Act (31 U.S.C. 
3
1342). 
4
(6) The Secretary of Homeland Security, 
5
Alejandro Mayorkas, failed to provide clear answers 
6
to Congress about the so-called ‘‘Disinformation 
7
Governance Board’’ and the selection of Nina 
8
Jankowicz to lead the Disinformation Governance 
9
Board. 
10
(7) Damning whistleblower documents revealed 
11
by Senators Josh Hawley and Chuck Grassley show 
12
the shocking extent to which the Disinformation 
13
Governance Board was willing to spy on Americans, 
14
without a warrant, and flag posts for social media 
15
companies as so-called ‘‘disinformation’’. 
16
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
17
It is the sense of Congress that: 
18
(1) The records produced by the Centers for 
19
Disease Control and Prevention in response to the 
20
Freedom of Information Act request described in 
21
section 2(5) reveal the extent to which the Biden 
22
Administration is willing to engage in unconstitu-
23
tional and otherwise unlawful activities in total dis-
24
regard of the rights of the American people. 
25
21:52 Dec 14, 2022

•HR 9448 IH
(2) The ‘‘Disinformation Governance Board’’ 
1
established by the Department of Homeland Secu-
2
rity is unconstitutional and should be terminated im-
3
mediately. 
4
(3) The failure of Secretary Mayorkas to pro-
5
vide clear answers about the Disinformation Govern-
6
ance Board is disqualifying, and Secretary Mayorkas 
7
should resign immediately. 
8
(4) The antidote to ‘‘misinformation’’ and 
9
‘‘disinformation’’ is not censorship but more infor-
10
mation, so the American people can make informed 
11
decisions independently. 
12
(5) The Federal Government should not be al-
13
lowed to circumvent the Constitution of the United 
14
States through intermediaries and third parties to 
15
violate the rights of the American people to informa-
16
tion and freedom from intrusion by the Federal Gov-
17
ernment, even if the information is not consistent 
18
with the views of officials in the Federal Govern-
19
ment.
