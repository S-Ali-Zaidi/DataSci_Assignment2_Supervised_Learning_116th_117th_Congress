SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) The United Nations Population Fund 
8
(UNFPA) is the United Nations reproductive health 
9
agency. 
10
(2) UNFPA was founded with the leadership of 
11
the United States 50 years ago and works in more 
12
than 150 countries to end preventable maternal 
13
deaths, the unmet need for contraception, and gen-
14
der-based violence and other harmful practices, in-
15
cluding female genital mutilation and child mar-
16
riage. 
17
(3) UNFPA also ensures access to health care 
18
and essential supplies for women and families im-
19
pacted by emergencies.

the United States, at the 1994 International Con-
1
ference for Population and Development. The prin-
2
ciples include that ‘‘reproductive health care pro-
3
grams should provide the widest range of services 
4
without any form of coercion. All couples and indi-
5
viduals have the basic right to decide freely and re-
6
sponsibly the number and spacing of their children 
7
and to have the information, education and means to 
8
do so.’’. 
9
(5) UNFPA is currently working to address the 
10
needs of the following: 
11
(A) The 810 women and adolescent girls 
12
who die each day from preventable causes re-
13
lated to pregnancy and childbirth, 99 percent of 
14
which deaths occur in developing countries and 
15
more than half of which occur in fragile and 
16
humanitarian settings. 
17
(B) The more than 218,000,000 women of 
18
reproductive age in low- and middle-income 
19
countries who want to avoid pregnancy and are 
20
not using a modern contraceptive method. 
21
(C) The estimated 1 in 3 women who expe-
22
rience gender-based violence.

(D) The estimated 200,000,000 women 
1
who have survived some form of female genital 
2
mutilation. 
3
(E) The estimated 15,000,000 girls who 
4
are forcibly married before the age of 18 each 
5
year. 
6
(6) In recent years, the United States has been 
7
the third-largest overall donor to UNFPA, and its 
8
second-largest donor for humanitarian response. 
9
(7) UNFPA, which works in three times as 
10
many countries as the United States Agency for 
11
International Development, extends the impact of 
12
United States foreign assistance by reaching people 
13
in politically unstable regions. UNFPA also plays a 
14
pivotal role in meeting protection and health care 
15
needs in countries experiencing humanitarian emer-
16
gencies like Syria, Yemen, and Iraq. 
17
(8) Voluntary family planning is central to gen-
18
der equality and women’s empowerment, and it is a 
19
key factor in reducing poverty. 
20
(9) UNFPA is responding to the needs of 
21
women and girls affected by the COVID–19 out-
22
break by focusing on countries that have weak public 
23
health and social support systems to limit potential 
24
increases in unmet need for family planning, gender

9
and to attain the highest standard of sexual and re-
10
productive health, is a basic human right. 
11

14
right.

16
status of women and expanding access to voluntary

18
ices throughout the world.

20
and reproductive health programs are voluntary and 
21
centered on protecting human rights.

24
health, development, and human rights, and the
