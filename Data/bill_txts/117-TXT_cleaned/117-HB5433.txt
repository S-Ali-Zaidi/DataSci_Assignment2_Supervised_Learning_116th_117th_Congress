business with them as provided for in this title and that

SEC. 103. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following: 
4
(1) Individuals are endowed with rights to se-
5
cure and protect data related to their lives, their 
6
patterns of movement and commercial exchange and 
7
any other information that is classified as sensitive 
8
pursuant to this title. 
9
(2) Individuals have a right to complete trans-
10
parency with respect to the exchanges they make in 
11
terms of a complete accounting of both the nonpecu-
12
niary and pecuniary costs allocated to and collected 
13
from them. 
14
(3) While the internet and other technologies 
15
have produced enormous benefits to the Nation, they 
16
have also had unintentional consequences in eroding 
17
individual data privacy rights. 
18
(4) The Nation needs to update individual 
19
rights to include adequate and effective protections 
20
to secure and sustain individual rights to data pri-
21
vacy. 
22
(5) That protection of individual data privacy 
23
rights should be secured with due consideration of 
24
the collateral rights of entities to pursue businesses
