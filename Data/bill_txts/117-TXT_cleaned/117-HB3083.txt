Congress makes the following findings:

•HR 3083 IH
(1) Positive relationships are important for chil-
1
dren and youth. An estimated 20 percent of youth 
2
do not have caring adults in their lives—rep-
3
resenting 8,500,000 youth. Children who have a 
4
positive caring relationship with an adult can also 
5
benefit from additional positive relationships. 
6
(2) Research shows that mentors make a dif-
7
ference in young people’s lives. At-risk youth who 
8
have mentors are 55 percent more likely to enroll in 
9
college. Students who meet regularly with their men-
10
tors are 52 percent less likely than their peers to 
11
skip a day of school. Youth who have mentors are 
12
also 130 percent more likely to hold a leadership po-
13
sition. 
14
(3) Young people that have mentors have im-
15
proved relationships with adults, fewer disciplinary 
16
referrals, and more confidence to achieve their goals. 
17
(4) In 2017, 442,995 youth were in foster care. 
18
Of those youth 70,858 were between the ages of 10 
19
and 13, and 101,983 were between the ages of 14 
20
and 20. 
21
(5) Mentoring programs that serve foster youth 
22
are unique and require additional considerations, in-
23
cluding specialized training and support necessary to 
24

•HR 3083 IH
provide for consistent, long-term relationships for 
1
children in foster care. 
2
(6) Mentoring programs can be used as an ef-
3
fective preventative or intervention strategy to sup-
4
port positive outcomes for foster youth. 
5
(7) Mentoring programs targeting at-risk 
6
youth, community-based programs, and programs 
7
lasting 1 year or more are more frequently found to 
8
be effective. 
9
(8) Increasing evidence is showing that peer 
10
mentoring and support can be very effective in en-
11
gaging young people. Alumni of and youth in foster 
12
care have noted the importance of the support and 
13
service delivery by individuals with lived experience, 
14
including peers.
