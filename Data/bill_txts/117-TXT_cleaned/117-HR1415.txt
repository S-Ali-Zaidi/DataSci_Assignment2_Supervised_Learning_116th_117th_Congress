RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the need for diapers and expressing support 
for donating generously to diaper banks, diaper drives, 
and organizations that distribute diapers to families in 
need. 
Whereas diaper need, the condition of not having a sufficient 
supply of clean diapers to keep babies and toddlers clean, 
dry, and healthy, can adversely affect the health and 
well-being of babies, toddlers, and their families; 
Whereas national surveys and research studies report that 1 
in 3 families struggle with diaper need, and 48 percent 
of families delay changing a diaper to extend the avail-
able supply;

Whereas infants and toddlers go through 6 to 12 diapers 
each day during the 2 to 3 years they wear diapers; 
Whereas purchasing enough diapers to keep a baby or toddler 
clean, dry, and healthy can consume 14 percent of a low- 
wage family’s post-tax income, making it difficult to pro-
vide the necessary supply; 
Whereas a daily or weekly supply of diapers is generally an 
eligibility requirement for babies and toddlers to partici-
pate in child care programs and high-quality early-edu-
cation programs that enable children to thrive and par-
ents to work; 
Whereas many parents struggling with diaper need report 
missing an average of 4 days of work each month due to 
an insufficient supply of diapers; 
Whereas parents missing work due to diaper need hinders 
their ability to provide for their family financially, creates 
workforce problems for small businesses, and hurts the 
local economy; 
Whereas, without enough diapers, babies and toddlers risk in-
fections and health problems that may require medical 
attention resulting in medical costs, and parents may be 
prevented from accessing child care needed to go to work 
or school, thereby destabilizing the family’s economic 
prospects and well-being; 
Whereas addressing diaper need can lead to economic oppor-
tunity for families and communities and improved health 
for children, thus ensuring all children and families have 
access to the basic necessities required to thrive and 
reach their full potential; 
Whereas diaper banks and the staff and volunteers who run 
them are community leaders and logistics experts who en-

for members of their communities; and 
Whereas through their important work of addressing diaper 
need, diaper banks play a critical role in supporting fami-
lies, improving infant health and well-being, and advanc-
ing local and State economic growth: Now, therefore, be 
it
