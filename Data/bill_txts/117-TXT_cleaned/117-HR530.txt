RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that

enforcement agencies conduct critical operations to keep 
the United States safe and secure.

threats and have set an example of high standards for 
every Nation around us; 
Whereas the Department of Homeland Security was created 
after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks that took 
the lives of almost 3,000 Americans; 
Whereas since the creation of the Department of Homeland 
Security, there has been no major terrorist attack on 
United States soil; 
Whereas many Americans employed by these agencies risk 
their lives to protect United States citizens each day from 
threats to our Nation; 
Whereas Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and 
agents protect United States citizens from illegal immi-
gration and enforce our immigration laws within the 
United States; 
Whereas on an average day, Immigration and Customs En-
forcement seizes 4,000 pounds of narcotics, $4.93 million 
in illicit currency and assets, and manages 3.26 million 
immigration cases; 
Whereas Homeland Security Investigations agents are on the 
front lines defending our Nation and saving individuals 
from the abhorrent practice of human trafficking; 
Whereas Customs and Border Protection defends and main-
tains our borders, prevents criminals from entering our 
country illegally, and filters through contraband, such as 
illegal drugs and firearms, being transported over the 
border and into the United States; 
Whereas on an average day, Customs and Border Protection 
processes over 650,000 passengers and pedestrians, con-
ducts $216 million in duties and taxes on imports, and

seizes $3.6 million worth of products with intellectual 
property rights violations; 
Whereas the agencies within the Department of Homeland 
Security have found great success in safeguarding our 
Nation, and anyone who tries to say otherwise has failed 
to realize the role they play in having a safe and secure 
Nation; 
Whereas there have been numerous instances of elected offi-
cials claiming that continued funding will undermine 
trust in law enforcement, and it would be irresponsible 
for the Federal Government to continue funding this de-
partment; 
Whereas elected officials have been quoted saying the simple 
answer is to eliminate funding for Customs and Border 
Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and 
their parent organization, the Department of Homeland 
Security; and 
Whereas there has been legislation introduced in Congress to 
dismantle Immigration and Customs Enforcement: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives recog-
1
nizes that— 
2
(1) the Department of Homeland Security has 
3
and will continue to provide essential protection for 
4
our country from threats foreign and domestic; 
5
(2) these agencies have turned the United 
6
States into one of the safest countries in the world

today;

(3) defunding these essential organizations 
1
would be detrimental to the national security of the 
2
United States, and these efforts should never be en-
3
tertained by Congress; 
4
(4) rhetoric from elected officials claiming the 
5
Department of Homeland Security and its compo-
6
nents are harmful are utter falsehoods and are dam-
7
aging to the United States; and 
8
(5) any attempt to undermine the Department 
9
of Homeland Security by limiting its resources or 
10
changing its legal mandate does nothing but put 
11
American citizens in greater danger.
