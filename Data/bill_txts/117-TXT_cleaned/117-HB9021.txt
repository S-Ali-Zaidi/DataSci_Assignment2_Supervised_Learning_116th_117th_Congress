SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. 
1
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Section 2(b)(1) of the Americans with Dis-
3
abilities Act of 1990 states that the Act provides ‘‘a 
4
clear and comprehensive national mandate for the 
5
elimination of discrimination against individuals with 
6
disabilities’’ (42 U.S.C. 12101(b)(1)). 
7
(2) In 1990, websites and applications were es-
8
sentially nonexistent, but Congress made clear that 
9
the ADA ‘‘should keep pace with the rapidly chang-
10
ing technology of the times’’ (H.R. Rep. No. 101– 
11
485, pt. 2, at 381 (1990)), as reprinted in 1990 
12
U.S.C.C.A.N. 303, 391). 
13
(3) Section 102 of the ADA (42 U.S.C. 12112), 
14
section 202 of the ADA (42 U.S.C. 12132), and sec-
15
tion 302 of the ADA (42 U.S.C. 12182) broadly 
16
prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability in 
17
regard to employment, services, programs, or activi-
18
ties of public entities, and of goods, services, facili-
19
ties, privileges, advantages, and accommodations of 
20
any place of public accommodation, respectively. 
21
(4) The Department of Justice has promulgated 
22
regulations to address the intersection of the ADA 
23
and emerging technologies, including the obligation 
24
to ensure effective communication with and by indi-
25
viduals with disabilities by using technologies such 
26
02:25 Oct 08, 2022
H9021

•HR 9021 IH
as video remote interpreting, real-time computer- 
1
aided transcription, open and closed captioning, 
2
audio description, videophones, captioned telephones, 
3
screen reader software, optical readers, and tele-
4
phone systems that interact properly with internet- 
5
based relay systems. 
6
(5) The activities of a vast number of ADA-cov-
7
ered entities now occur in whole or in part through 
8
websites and applications, a shift that has been ac-
9
celerated by a global pandemic. The digital economy 
10
accounts for nearly 10 percent of the United States 
11
gross domestic product, and 85 percent of United 
12
States adults visit the internet at least once per day. 
13
(6) Many entities, including those covered by 
14
the ADA, rely on third-party technology providers to 
15
deliver goods and services via websites and applica-
16
tions, yet these websites and applications are often 
17
created and developed in a manner that is inacces-
18
sible to individuals with disabilities. 
19
(7) Despite the ADA’s clear language covering 
20
all services, programs, and activities of public enti-
21
ties, all goods, services, facilities, privileges, advan-
22
tages, and accommodations of public accommoda-
23
tions, and all terms, conditions, and privileges of em-
24
ployment and certain actions of employers, including 
25
02:25 Oct 08, 2022
H9021
4 
•HR 9021 IH
when conducted through websites and applications, 
1
most websites and applications contain significant 
2
barriers for individuals with disabilities. 
3
(8) When Congress enacted the ADA in 1990, 
4
Congress intended for the ADA to keep pace with 
5
rapidly changing technology. The Department of 
6
Justice has rightly acknowledged that the ADA re-
7
quires covered entities to ensure that their websites 
8
are accessible to individuals with disabilities. 
9
(9) Some courts have misconstrued the ADA, 
10
saying the ADA does not cover websites despite the 
11
clear language of the ADA’s provisions. 
12
(10) Without equal access to websites and ap-
13
plications, many individuals with disabilities are 
14
treated as second-class citizens and are excluded 
15
from equal participation in and equal access to all 
16
aspects of society. 
17
(b) PURPOSE.—It is the purpose of this Act— 
18
(1) to affirm that the ADA and this Act require 
19
that websites and applications used by any covered 
20
entity to communicate or interact with applicants, 
21
employees, participants, customers, or other mem-
22
bers of the public be readily accessible to and use-
23
able by individuals with disabilities, whether the en-
24
tity has a physical location or is digital only; 
25
02:25 Oct 08, 2022

•HR 9021 IH
(2) to require the Department of Justice and 
1
the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to 
2
set and enforce standards for websites and applica-
3
tions and to periodically update such standards; 
4
(3) to address and remedy the systemic nation-
5
wide problem of inaccessible websites and applica-
6
tions that exclude individuals with disabilities from 
7
equal participation in and equal access to all aspects 
8
of society; and 
9
(4) to create effective mechanisms to respond to 
10
emerging technologies and to ensure that such tech-
11
nologies do not impair the rights and abilities of in-
12
dividuals with disabilities to participate in all aspects 
13
of society.
