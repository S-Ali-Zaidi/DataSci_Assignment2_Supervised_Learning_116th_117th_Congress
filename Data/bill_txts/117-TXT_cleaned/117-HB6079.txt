A BILL 
To protect our democracy by preventing abuses of presi-
dential power, restoring checks and balances and ac-
countability and transparency in government, and de-
fending elections against foreign interference, and for 
other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Congressional Sub-
4
poena Compliance and Enforcement Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

The Congress finds as follows:

•HR 6079 IH
(1) As the Supreme Court has repeatedly af-
1
firmed, including in its July 9, 2020, holding in 
2
Trump v. Mazars, Congress’s ‘‘power of inquiry— 
3
with process to enforce it—is an essential and ap-
4
propriate auxiliary to the legislative function’’. 
5
Congress’s power to obtain information, including 
6
through the issuance of subpoenas and the enforce-
7
ment of such subpoenas, is ‘‘broad and indispen-
8
sable’’. 
9
(2) Congress ‘‘suffers a concrete and particular-
10
ized injury when denied the opportunity to obtain in-
11
formation necessary’’ to the exercise of its constitu-
12
tional functions, as the U.S. Court of Appeals for 
13
the District of Columbia Circuit correctly recognized 
14
in its August 7, 2020, en banc decision in Com-
15
mittee on the Judiciary of the U.S. House of Rep-
16
resentatives v. McGahn. 
17
(3) Accordingly, the Constitution secures to 
18
each House of Congress an inherent right to enforce 
19
its subpoenas in court. Explicit statutory authoriza-
20
tion is not required to secure such a right of action, 
21
and the contrary holding by a divided panel of the 
22
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia 
23
Circuit in McGahn, entered on August 31, 2020, 
24
was in error.
