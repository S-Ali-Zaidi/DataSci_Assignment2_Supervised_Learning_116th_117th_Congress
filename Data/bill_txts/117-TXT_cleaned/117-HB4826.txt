SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) There are an estimated 2,200,000 domestic 
3
workers across the United States working in private 
4

homes to provide home and personal care, child care, 
1
and house-cleaning services. 
2
(2) Domestic work is a job-enabling job that 
3
makes all other work possible. It is labor that cannot 
4
be outsourced to individuals abroad, nor is it close 
5
to being automated. Without the millions of domes-
6
tic workers caring for children, seniors, and people 
7
with disabilities, and cleaning homes, much of the 
8
economy would come to a standstill. 
9
(3) During the COVID–19 pandemic, domestic 
10
work and other low-wage service jobs, disproportion-
11
ately held by women, women of color, and immi-
12
grants, have been deemed essential. This crisis has 
13
shown how essential these jobs have always been to 
14
our economy. At great risk to the health of them-
15
selves and their families, domestic workers have 
16
worked on the frontlines of the pandemic to provide 
17
care to those more vulnerable to COVID–19, seniors, 
18
and individuals with disabilities, and have provided 
19
child care for the children of essential workers. A 
20
study of Black immigrant domestic workers con-
21
ducted by the Institute for Policy Studies and the 
22
National Domestic Workers Alliance in May and 
23
June of 2020 found that 25 percent of workers sur-
24
veyed experienced or lived with someone who has ex-
25

•HR 4826 IH
perienced COVID–19 symptoms. 73 percent of such 
1
workers surveyed indicated that they did not re-
2
ceived personal protective equipment (‘‘PPE’’) from 
3
their employers. 
4
(4) Domestic workers experienced a rapid and 
5
sustained loss of jobs during the COVID–19 pan-
6
demic, which exacerbated the existing financial inse-
7
curity experienced by many domestic workers. Sur-
8
veys from the National Domestic Workers Alliance 
9
and NDWA Labs between March and September 
10
2020 found that for 6 consecutive months more than 
11
half of domestic workers surveyed were unable to 
12
pay their rent or mortgage. Nearly 3⁄4 of workers 
13
surveyed did not receive any compensation when 
14
their jobs were canceled. 
15
(5) The employment of individuals in domestic 
16
service in households affects commerce, as described 
17
in section 2(a) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 
18
1938 (29 U.S.C. 202(a)). 
19
(6) Domestic workers are hired or contacted for 
20
work by phone, mail, or internet, or through news-
21
paper ads, and travel to work through transpor-
22
tation on interstate highways, interstate transit, or 
23
vehicles in interstate commerce.

(7) In 2019, the Bureau of Labor Statistics 
1
predicted that between 2019 and 2029— 
2
(A) the number of new jobs for home 
3
health and personal care aides will increase by 
4
34 percent, which is an increase of 1,159,500 
5
jobs and the largest increase in new jobs of any 
6
occupational category during such period; and 
7
(B) the number of new jobs for child care 
8
and house cleaning positions will increase by 6 
9
to 7 percent. 
10
(8) The COVID–19 pandemic has increased the 
11
demand for in-home child care. According to the 
12
Center for Translational Neuroscience, the percent-
13
age of parents reporting use of home-based child 
14
care has grown since the onset of the pandemic from 
15
27 percent to 31 percent. 
16
(9) An increasing number of workers, including 
17
domestic workers, are finding work on online plat-
18
forms. An analysis from the JPMorgan Chase Insti-
19
tute found that between 2013 and 2018, the per-
20
centage of adults that had earned income from on-
21
line platforms increased from 0.3 percent to 1.5 per-
22
cent. 
23
(10) 9 out of 10 domestic workers are women, 
24
and such women are disproportionately people of 
25
17:23 Aug 24, 2021

•HR 4826 IH
color and immigrants. Women, people of color, and 
1
immigrants have historically faced barriers to em-
2
ployment and economic advancement. According to 
3
the Economic Policy Institute, domestic workers also 
4
tend to be older than other workers. 2 in 5 domestic 
5
workers are age 50 or older, while just 1⁄3 of all 
6
other workers are at least 50 years old. 
7
(11) Domestic workers are paid low wages, can 
8
be subjected to workplace health and safety hazards, 
9
and face difficulties saving for retirement. An Eco-
10
nomic Policy Institute analysis of data from the 
11
Current Population Survey indicates that the aver-
12
age wage for a domestic worker is approximately 
13
$12 per hour or $15,980 per year if working full- 
14
time. In practice, the average wage for a domestic 
15
worker is less than such approximation given that 
16
domestic work has largely been negotiated in the in-
17
formal labor market. 
18
(12) Low-wage workers, including domestic 
19
workers, experience high rates of minimum wage 
20
and overtime violations, violations of laws related to 
21
workers’ compensation and other workplace benefits, 
22
and illegal retaliation. A 2017 study from the Eco-
23
nomic Policy Institute found that 2,400,000 work-
24
ers—17 percent of the low-wage workforce—experi-
25

ences wage theft. A 2009 report from the National 
1
Employment Law Project found that employment in 
2
private homes was one of the 3 industries with the 
3
highest rates of employment and labor law viola-
4
tions. 
5
(13) A landmark study of domestic workers 
6
published in 2012 by the National Domestic Work-
7
ers Alliance and the Center for Urban Economic De-
8
velopment of the University of Illinois at Chicago 
9
Data Center titled ‘‘Home Economics: The Invisible 
10
and Unregulated World of Domestic Work’’ indi-
11
cated poor working conditions across the domestic 
12
workers industry. The findings of such study in-
13
cluded that— 
14
(A) domestic workers have little control 
15
over their working conditions, and employment 
16
is usually arranged without a written contract; 
17
(B) 35 percent of domestic workers inter-
18
viewed reported that they worked long hours 
19
without breaks in the year immediately pre-
20
ceding the interview; 
21
(C) 25 percent of live-in domestic workers 
22
had responsibilities that prevented them from 
23
getting at least 5 hours of uninterrupted sleep 
24

•HR 4826 IH
at night during the week immediately preceding 
1
the interview; and 
2
(D) 91 percent of domestic workers inter-
3
viewed who encountered problems with their 
4
working conditions in the year immediately pre-
5
ceding the interview did not complain about 
6
their working conditions because they were 
7
afraid they would lose their job. 
8
(14) The study described in paragraph (13) 
9
found that domestic workers have little access to 
10
federally supported employment benefits. For in-
11
stance— 
12
(A) less than 2 percent of such workers re-
13
ceive retirement or pension benefits, and less 
14
than 9 percent of such workers work for em-
15
ployers that collect payroll taxes on wages paid 
16
to such workers to provide eligibility for Social 
17
Security benefits; and 
18
(B) 65 percent of such workers do not 
19
have health insurance, and only 4 percent of 
20
such workers receive employer-provided insur-
21
ance, despite the fact that domestic work is 
22
hazardous and often results in illness or phys-
23
ical injuries. 
24
17:23 Aug 24, 2021
H4826
10 
•HR 4826 IH
(15) Compounding these challenges is the fact 
1
that many domestic workers have been, and in many 
2
cases continue to be, excluded from key provisions of 
3
labor and employment laws like the Occupational 
4
Health and Safety Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 651 et 
5
seq.), and the National Labor Relations Act (29 
6
U.S.C. 151 et seq.). Live-in domestic workers em-
7
ployed by private households remain excluded from 
8
the overtime protections in the Fair Labor Stand-
9
ards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 201 et seq.). Minimum 
10
employee threshold rules, misclassification of domes-
11
tic workers as independent contractors, and exclu-
12
sion of independent contractors from coverage mean 
13
that most domestic workers are also de facto ex-
14
cluded from Federal civil rights protections, includ-
15
ing protections under title VII of the Civil Rights 
16
Act of 1964 (29 U.S.C. 2000e et seq.) and other 
17
laws. 
18
(16) The International Labour Organization’s 
19
Domestic Workers Convention, adopted in 2011, 
20
calls for domestic workers to have the right to free-
21
dom of association and collective actions, protections 
22
against harassment, privacy rights, and the right to 
23
be informed of conditions of employment. This Con-
24
vention also calls for the right of domestic workers 
25
17:23 Aug 24, 2021
H4826
11 
•HR 4826 IH
to keep their travel documents, the right to overtime 
1
compensation and rest breaks, the right to minimum 
2
wage coverage, the right to occupational safety and 
3
health protections, and mechanisms to pursue com-
4
plaints and ensure compliance with the law. 
5
(17) The unique nature of their work, in pri-
6
vate homes with individuals and families, also often 
7
makes it difficult for domestic workers to use Fed-
8
eral programs and policies to improve their skills 
9
and training and to join together collectively to ne-
10
gotiate better pay and working conditions. 
11
(18) Many domestic workers are also vulnerable 
12
to discrimination and sexual harassment. These 
13
issues are further exacerbated by the unique working 
14
conditions faced by domestic workers, such as isola-
15
tion, poverty, immigration status, the lack of famili-
16
arity with the law and legal processes, limited net-
17
works for support, language barriers, and fear of re-
18
taliation and deportation. 
19
(19) Millions of older individuals, individuals 
20
with disabilities, and families are increasingly relying 
21
on domestic workers. By bringing domestic work out 
22
of the shadows and creating incentives and invest-
23
ments that help raise wages and standards for do-
24
mestic workers, the Federal Government can lift mil-

lions of the most vulnerable workers out of poverty, 
1
reduce turnover due to poor working conditions, 
2
thereby enhancing quality of care, and support the 
3
millions of working and retired people of the United 
4
States who rely on them.
