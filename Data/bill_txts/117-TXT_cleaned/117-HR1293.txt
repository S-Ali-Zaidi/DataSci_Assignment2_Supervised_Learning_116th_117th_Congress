RESOLUTION 
Recognizing and honoring Elisjsha Dicken for his demonstra-
tion of courage, self-sacrifice, and fidelity to his fellow 
Americans. 
Whereas Elisjsha Dicken of Seymour, Indiana, demonstrated 
uncommon courage in defending his fellow citizens 
against an armed shooter at a mall in Greenwood, Indi-
ana, on July 17, 2022; 
Whereas a recent decision by the State of Indiana to repeal 
a requirement mandating that citizens obtain a permit 
before carrying a handgun in public enabled Mr. Dicken 
to carry his 9mm Glock lawfully;

•HRES 1293 IH 
Whereas restrictions on gun ownership and the imposition of 
failed gun control policies, to include gun-free zones, 
make Americans less safe; 
Whereas a 2013 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
study found that defensive gun uses range from about 
500,000 to more than 3,000,000 on an annual basis; 
Whereas only 15 seconds elapsed between the beginning of 
the Greenwood Park Mall shooting and Mr. Dicken’s 
intervention that eliminated the shooter, saving countless 
lives; 
Whereas Elisjsha Dicken is an American hero who deserves 
the thanks of a Nation; and 
Whereas Mr. Dicken was described by Greenwood Police 
Chief James Ison as ‘‘responsible’’, ‘‘very proficient’’, and 
‘‘very tactically sound’’, and Ison further remarked that 
Mr. Dicken’s actions ‘‘were nothing short of heroic’’: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives recog-
1
nizes and honors Elisjsha Dicken for his demonstration 
2
of courage, self-sacrifice, and fidelity to his fellow Ameri-

cans.
