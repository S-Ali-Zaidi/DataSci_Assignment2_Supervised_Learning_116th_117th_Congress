RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the duty of the Federal Government to create 
a Green New Deal. 
Whereas the October 2018 report entitled ‘‘Special Report on 
Global Warming of 1.5 oC’’ by the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change and the November 2018 
Fourth National Climate Assessment report found that— 
(1) human activity is the dominant cause of ob-
served climate change over the past century; 
(2) a changing climate is causing sea levels to rise 
and an increase in wildfires, severe storms, droughts, and 
other extreme weather events that threaten human life, 
healthy communities, and critical infrastructure; 
(3) global warming at or above 2 degrees Celsius be-
yond preindustrialized levels will cause— 
(A) mass migration from the regions most af-
fected by climate change; 
(B) more than $500,000,000,000 in lost annual 
economic output in the United States by the year 
2100; 
(C) wildfires that, by 2050, will annually burn 
at least twice as much forest area in the western 
United States than was typically burned by wildfires 
in the years preceding 2019; 
(D) a loss of more than 99 percent of all coral 
reefs on Earth; 
(E) more than 350,000,000 more people to be 
exposed globally to deadly heat stress by 2050; and

•HRES 332 IH 
(F) a risk of damage to $1,000,000,000,000 of 
public infrastructure and coastal real estate in the 
United States; and 
(4) global temperatures must be kept below 1.5 de-
grees Celsius above preindustrialized levels to avoid the 
most severe impacts of a changing climate, which will re-
quire— 
(A) global reductions in greenhouse gas emis-
sions from human sources of 40 to 60 percent from 
2010 levels by 2030; and 
(B) net-zero global emissions by 2050; 
Whereas, because the United States has historically been re-
sponsible for a disproportionate amount of greenhouse 
gas emissions, having emitted 20 percent of global green-
house gas emissions through 2014, and has a high tech-
nological capacity, the United States must take a leading 
role in reducing emissions through economic trans-
formation; 
Whereas the United States is currently experiencing several 
related crises, with— 
(1) life expectancy declining while basic needs, such 
as clean air, clean water, healthy food, and adequate 
health care, housing, transportation, and education, are 
inaccessible to a significant portion of the United States 
population; 
(2) 
a 
4-decade 
trend 
of 
wage 
stagnation, 
deindustrialization, and antilabor policies that has led 
to— 
(A) hourly wages overall stagnating since the 
1970s despite increased worker productivity; 
01:52 Apr 21, 2021

•HRES 332 IH 
(B) the third-worst level of socioeconomic mo-
bility in the developed world before the Great Reces-
sion; 
(C) the erosion of the earning and bargaining 
power of workers in the United States; and 
(D) inadequate resources for public sector 
workers to confront the challenges of climate change 
at local, State, and Federal levels; and 
(3) the greatest income inequality since the 1920s, 
with— 
(A) the top 1 percent of earners accruing 91 
percent of gains in the first few years of economic 
recovery after the Great Recession; 
(B) a large racial wealth divide amounting to a 
difference of 20 times more wealth between the aver-
age White family and the average Black family; and 
(C) a gender earnings gap that results in 
women earning approximately 80 percent as much 
as men, at the median; 
Whereas climate change, pollution, and environmental de-
struction have exacerbated systemic racial, regional, so-
cial, environmental, and economic injustices (referred to 
in this preamble as ‘‘systemic injustices’’) by dispropor-
tionately affecting indigenous peoples, communities of 
color, migrant communities, deindustrialized commu-
nities, depopulated rural communities, the poor, low-in-
come workers, women, the elderly, the unhoused, people 
with disabilities, and youth (referred to in this preamble 
as ‘‘frontline and vulnerable communities’’); 
Whereas climate change constitutes a direct threat to the na-
tional security of the United States—

(1) by impacting the economic, environmental, and 
social stability of countries and communities around the 
world; and 
(2) by acting as a threat multiplier; 
Whereas the Federal Government-led mobilizations during 
World War II and the New Deal created the greatest 
middle class that the United States has ever seen, but 
many members of frontline and vulnerable communities 
were excluded from many of the economic and societal 
benefits of those mobilizations; and 
Whereas the House of Representatives recognizes that a new 
national, social, industrial, and economic mobilization on 
a scale not seen since World War II and the New Deal 
era is a historic opportunity— 
(1) to create millions of good, high-wage jobs in the 
United States; 
(2) to provide unprecedented levels of prosperity and 
economic security for all people of the United States; and 
(3) to counteract systemic injustices: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-

(1) it is the duty of the Federal Government to

create a Green New Deal—
