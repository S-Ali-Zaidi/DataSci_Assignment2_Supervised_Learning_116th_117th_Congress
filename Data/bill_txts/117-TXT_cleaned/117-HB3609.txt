A BILL 
To improve public trust in the Federal Government by estab-
lishing customer experience as a central measure of per-
formance for agencies and the Federal Government, and 
for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Trust in Public Service 
4
Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7

2 
•HR 3609 IH
(1) Although the public believes that the Fed-
1
eral Government serves an indispensable role and 
2
often performs quite well, overall trust in the Fed-
3
eral Government is at historic lows. 
4
(2) Agencies face competing requirements and 
5
respond to evolving and diverse needs in a context 
6
of uncertainty and constrained resources. To per-
7
form this challenging job for the benefit of the pub-
8
lic, experimentation, learning, and failure should be 
9
expected and welcomed. Congress must support 
10
agencies throughout this process by balancing tradi-
11
tional oversight with dedicated efforts to celebrate 
12
progress and locate setbacks within a broader con-
13
text. 
14
(3) Improving public trust requires delivering 
15
tangible results that address the needs of the public, 
16
including those needs that span agencies or require 
17
coordination with State, local, Tribal, or territorial 
18
governments. But improving public trust also re-
19
quires the Federal Government to consider much 
20
more deeply how interaction with the public shapes 
21
public perceptions and how communication by the 
22
Federal Government can provide better context on 
23
the many ways in which the Federal Government 
24
serves the public.

•HR 3609 IH
(4) In terms of public interaction, whether seek-
1
ing a small business loan, veterans’ services, Social 
2
Security benefits, or other service or information, 
3
the people of the United States deserve a customer 
4
experience that matches or exceeds that of leading 
5
private sector organizations. This level of customer 
6
experience means experiences are seamless, con-
7
nected, inclusive, effective, consistent, and reliable. 
8
(5) Customer experience (commonly referred to 
9
as ‘‘CX’’) is a vital means for agencies to pursue 
10
their missions in a more effective and responsive 
11
way and at a lower cost, as research shows that cus-
12
tomer experience is linked to— 
13
(A) more accurate and timely data submis-
14
sions; 
15
(B) increased feedback that improves serv-
16
ices through 3 different means, which include— 
17
(i) process, procedure, product, or 
18
safety improvement; 
19
(ii) uncovering unmet customer needs 
20
that require a new or innovative approach; 
21
and 
22
(iii) informing leadership decision 
23
making so that agencies are grounded in 
24
improving customer outcomes;

(C) improved compliance with agency regu-
1
lations and guidance; and 
2
(D) improved workforce morale and reten-
3
tion. 
4
(6) Customer experience is also highly cor-
5
related with public trust in the Federal Government 
6
and is therefore essential for broader efforts of the 
7
Federal Government to earn and maintain the con-
8
sent of the governed. 
9
(7) Yet the Forrester’s 2020 Federal Customer 
10
Experience Index noted that Federal customer expe-
11
rience lags behind all sectors of private industry. 
12
While the Federal Government faces constraints that 
13
the private sector does not face, including competing 
14
requirements, such as balancing speed and com-
15
bating fraud, an obligation to serve the entire public, 
16
less nimble workforce and hiring policies, and per-
17
sonnel and spending constraints, the Federal Gov-
18
ernment has both the ability and imperative to im-
19
prove customer experience. 
20
(8) Research also shows a strong correlation be-
21
tween employee engagement and the quality of cus-
22
tomer experience. Employees provide better cus-
23
tomer experience when they feel valued and identify 
24
with the missions of their agencies, and, as customer

experience and confidence in the agency improves, 
1
those employees become even more committed, cre-
2
ative, and professional.

4
cant progress on improving customer experience, in-
5
cluding through— 
6
(A) efforts within the General Services Ad-
7

7
(10) With respect to communication, agencies 
8
have both a constitutional duty and an operational 
9
imperative to better communicate how those agen-
10
cies serve the public, including through stories of 
11
human-level impact, compelling design, and inter-
12
active platforms that make the public feel valued 
13
and included, particularly if agencies work in 
14
counterintuitive, preventative, or subtle ways. 
15
(11) A push towards open government, in par-
16
ticular through data.gov, performance.gov, chal-
17
lenge.gov, and other transparency efforts, are vital 
18
steps to improving public confidence and decision- 
19
making and service delivery. Additionally, open data 
20
is a vital service for the public that researchers, 
21
businesses, nonprofit organizations, and the public 
22
alike can use to innovate, promote economic growth, 
23
and take an active role in improving communities 
24
alongside the Federal Government. 
25
06:02 Jul 03, 2021
H3609

•HR 3609 IH
(12) But open government is not enough. To 
1
truly nourish a debate about the achievements and 
2
role of the Federal Government, rather than simply 
3
making information available, agencies must commu-
4
nicate their mandates, performance, and data in a 
5
manner that ensures that the public understands the 
6
broader context in which those agencies operate and 
7
the real-world impact of those agencies. 
8
(13) In performing the tasks described in para-
9
graph (12), the Federal Government has broad lati-
10
tude to communicate to the public in tailored, cre-
11
ative, and compelling ways. Provisions in annual ap-
12
propriations Acts typically bar agencies from engag-
13
ing in impermissible publicity or propaganda. Al-
14
though those provisions prohibit agencies from en-
15
gaging in self-aggrandizement, covert propaganda 
16
and purely partisan communications, those provi-
17
sions do not restrict agencies from engaging in le-
18
gitimate activities to inform the public about agency 
19
programs. Full compliance with those provisions pre-
20
sents no bar for an agency to fully implement the 
21
activities authorized and encouraged in this Act. As 
22
necessary, agencies may seek decisions and informal 
23
technical assistance from the Comptroller General of 
24

the United States concerning the applicability of 
1
prohibitions against publicity or propaganda. 
2
(14) USA.gov and other-Government wide plat-
3
forms, such as login.gov, have the potential to be-
4
come interactive, personalized, and compelling por-
5
tals to the Federal Government and enable the pub-
6
lic to both address its needs, learn about the myriad 
7
ways in which the Federal Government improves the 
8
lives of the public, and develop a greater sense of 
9
pride in the Federal Government. However, the cur-
10
rent incarnations of Government-wide communica-
11
tion platforms fall well short of this vision. 
12
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
13
Is it the sense of Congress that— 
14
(1) agencies must— 
15
(A) continue to develop customer-centered 
16
mindsets as a means to providing high-quality, 
17
responsive, inclusive, reliable, transparent, em-
18
pathetic, courteous, and efficient services to the 
19
people of the United States; and 
20
(B) use public feedback and human-cen-
21
tered design practices to continually improve 
22
services; 
23
(2) all agency interaction with the public must 
24
be seen as an invaluable opportunity to strengthen 
25
06:02 Jul 03, 2021
H3609
10 
•HR 3609 IH
the bond of trust between the people of the United 
1
States and the Federal Government as a whole; 
2
(3) to this end, the Federal Government 
3
must— 
4
(A) adopt a whole-of-Government, inte-
5
grated, and enterprise approach to service deliv-
6
ery; 
7
(B) build out the technical capacity of the 
8
Federal Government, as has been done with the 
9
establishment of the United States Digital 
10
Service and the Technology Transformation 
11
Service of the General Services Administration, 
12
that creates a strategy, accountability, and per-
13
formance framework for identifying and defin-
14
ing experiences and managing improvements 
15
across agency delivery systems; 
16
(C) enhance customer experience based on 
17
an understanding of true needs of the public, 
18
rather solely on individual agency or program 
19
mandates; 
20
(D) identify ambitious agency and Govern-
21
ment-wide customer experience priorities; 
22
(E) develop consistent approaches to cus-
23
tomer experience across the Federal Govern-

ment, as consistency is central to building Gov-
1
ernment-wide trust; and 
2
(F) mobilize resources to support the Chief 
3
of Staffs, Chief Operating Officers, or equiva-
4
lent officials, of agencies and hold those offi-
5
cials 
accountable 
for 
customer 
experience

through statutorily-established councils, such as 
7
the Performance Improvement Council, the 
8
Chief Information Officers Council, the Chief 
9
Data Officers Council, the Evaluation Officer 
10
Council, the Chief Human Capital Officers 
11
Council, and the President’s Management 
12
Council; 
13
(4) while the imperative to improve customer 
14
experience particularly applies to high-impact service 
15
providers, which have frequent interaction with the 
16
public or high profiles, all agencies, no matter the 
17
scope of the mission of an agency or the manner in 
18
which an agency works, have an obligation and op-
19
portunity to proactively and effectively communicate 
20
how those agencies serve the public as a means to-
21
wards increasing responsiveness and contributing to 
22
public trust in the Federal Government; 
23
(5) to understand if information is effectively 
24
communicated by agencies, agency communication

(A) human-level stories; 
3
(B) proactive outreach; 
4
(C) modern design, including multimedia; 
5
(D) opportunities for public participation; 
6
and 
7
(E) feedback and testing; 
8
(6) to inspire Federal employees and contrac-
9
tors to serve the public in a responsive, creative, and 
10
professional manner, agencies must improve em-
11
ployee engagement, including by— 
12
(A) regularly soliciting and responding to 
13
employee feedback and improving internal agen-
14
cy services, such as human resources and infor-
15
mation technology; and 
16
(B) using human-centered design practices; 
17
and 
18
(7) similarly, when agencies provide information 
19
or services to each other, these interactions should 
20
be characterized by effectiveness, ease, and respon-
21
siveness to help enable fellow agencies to provide the 
22
public with high-quality customer experience.
