A BILL 
To direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to carry out 
a pilot program for the cognitive care of veterans, and 
for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Innovative Cognitive 
4
Care for Veterans Act of 2022’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) According to a 2020 study by the Office of 
8
the Assistant Deputy Under Secretary for Health 
9
for Policy and Planning of the Department of Vet-

erans Affairs, it is projected that the number of vet-
1
erans with Alzheimer’s dementia will increase by 
2
28.9 percent between fiscal year 2021 and fiscal 
3
year 2033, amounting to an estimated 48,000 new 
4
patients with cognitive impairments. 
5
(2) The cost of expenditures of the Department 
6
of Veterans Affairs for long-term care is growing 
7
rapidly, as demonstrated by a 2020 Government Ac-
8
countability Office report that estimates such ex-
9
penditures 
are 
projected 
to 
double 
to 
10
$14,300,000,000 by 2037. 
11
(3) As described in the report specified in para-
12
graph (2), the Department of Veterans Affairs also 
13
faces both a current and incoming workforce short-
14
age, in addition to other challenges relating to the 
15
provision of long-term care services to the more than 
16
2,800,000 estimated veterans who are enrolled in 
17
the patient enrollment system of the Department es-
18
tablished and operated under section 1705(a) of title 
19
38, United States Code, and live in rural areas. 
20
(4) As observed by the Secretary of Veterans 
21
Affairs, veterans can also be prone to unique factors 
22
that increase the risk for future cognitive impair-
23
ment. For example, it has been found that veterans 
24
who served during the Vietnam era and, while so

serving, were exposed to Agent Orange are nearly 
1
twice as likely as those without such exposure to re-
2
ceive a diagnosis of dementia. 
3
(5) This data compels the United States Gov-
4
ernment to do more for veterans and their cognitive 
5
care.
