SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE. 
1
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Since its founding, America has steadily 
3
worked to ensure the right to vote for all through 
4
State law, Federal law, and constitutional amend-
5
ments. 
6
(2) Almost a quarter of the electorate will be 65 
7
years old or older in 2020. 
8
(3) Of the 37,000,000 voting age individuals 
9
with 
disabilities 
in 
America, 
an 
estimated 
10
14,300,000 citizens with disabilities reported voting 
11
in the November 2018 election.

•HR 2941 IH
(4) Older individuals who have been lifelong 
1
voters and who now find it difficult to leave their 
2
home often cannot vote in person. 
3
(5) Despite Federal laws requiring fully acces-
4
sible voting places, barriers to vote for people with 
5
disabilities and older individuals still exist. 
6
(6) In 2016 only 40 percent of polling places 
7
were architecturally accessible and only 45 percent 
8
of voting booths were accessible. 
9
(7) Combining deficiencies in architectural and 
10
voting booth access, only 17 percent of polling places 
11
could be considered fully accessible in 2016. 
12
(8) People with disabilities voted at a rate of 
13
4.7 percent less than non-disabled individuals in 
14
2016. 
15
(9) In 2017, the Native American Voting 
16
Rights Coalition found that the distance needed to 
17
travel to polling locations and drop off boxes for ab-
18
sentee ballots greatly affected the ability of Native 
19
Americans to cast ballots. 
20
(10) The National Congress of American Indi-
21
ans found that the turnout rate for Native Ameri-
22
cans and Alaska Native registered voters is between 
23
5 to 14 percent lower than turnout rates of other ra-
24
cial and ethnic groups.

(11) According to the United States Census 
1
Bureau, there are nearly 26,000,000 individuals in 
2
the United States with limited English proficiency 
3
and more than 66,000,000 who speak a language 
4
other than English at home. Americans with limited 
5
English proficiency can face challenges when at-
6
tempting to register to vote and cast a ballot. 
7
(12) A strong legislative focus on the needs of 
8
older individuals, individuals with disabilities, Native 
9
Americans, Alaska Natives, and individuals with lim-
10
ited proficiency in the English language is necessary 
11
to remove obstacles to vote and ensure they can ex-
12
ercise their right to vote. 
13
(b) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act is to improve 
14
access for older individuals, individuals with disabilities, 
15
Native Americans, Alaska Natives, and individuals with 
16
limited proficiency in the English language to register to 
17
vote and to cast a ballot by— 
18
(1) providing States and local governments with 
19
resources to improve accessibility when registering to 
20
vote, voting by absentee, and casting a ballot in per-
21
son; and 
22
(2) expanding Federal oversight and support to 
23
ensure greater accessibility to State voting systems.
