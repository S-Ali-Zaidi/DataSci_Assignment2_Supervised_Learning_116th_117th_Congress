Whereas innovations in chemistry continue to spur economic 
growth and job creation, and have applications for a wide 
range of industries; 
Whereas the practitioners of chemistry are catalysts of posi-
tive change in their communities and the world; 
Whereas National Chemistry Week is part of a broader vision 
to improve human life through chemistry and to advance 
the chemistry enterprise; 
Whereas the purpose of National Chemistry Week is to reach 
the public with educational messages about chemistry in 
order to foster greater understanding of and appreciation 
for the applications and benefits of chemistry; 
Whereas National Chemistry Week strives to stimulate the 
interest of young people, including women and underrep-
resented groups, in enthusiastically studying science, 
technology, engineering, and mathematics, and in pur-
suing science-related careers that lead to innovations and 
major scientific breakthroughs; 
Whereas National Chemistry Week signifies the collaborative 
nature of science and promotes partnership between sci-
entific societies, academia, industry, and the public; 
Whereas National Chemistry Week highlights many of the ev-
eryday uses of chemistry, including in food, dyes and pig-
ments, plastics, soaps and detergents, health products, 
and energy technologies; 
Whereas the theme of the 33rd annual National Chemistry 
Week is ‘‘Fabulous Fibers: The Chemistry of Fabrics’’; 
and 
Whereas students who participate in National Chemistry 
Week deserve recognition and support for their efforts: 
Now, therefore, be it
