A BILL 
To direct the Attorney General to establish a pilot program 
to determine the effectiveness of body-worn camera con-
tinuous training programs. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. FINDINGS. 
3
Congress finds the following: 
4
(1) Although several studies have found signifi-
5
cant improvements in police-citizen encounters fol-
6
lowing the implementation of body-worn cameras a 
7
recent meta-analysis of the available research lit-
8
erature found that overall, the use of body-worn

cameras had no statistically significant impact on of-
1
ficers’ use of force. 
2
(2) Evidence suggests that one barrier to con-
3
tinuous quality improvement through use of body- 
4
worn cameras is lack of monitoring or a structured 
5
system of accountability. Body-worn camera footage 
6
appears to be used for other purposes, such as con-
7
firming the details of events for reports, rather than 
8
quality improvement efforts. 
9
(3) Preliminary evidence from health care set-
10
tings suggests that body-worn cameras can have sig-
11
nificant effects on behavior if they are used for the 
12
purpose of continuous quality improvement and feed-
13
back is provided. 
14
(4) Researchers have suggested that the imple-
15
mentation of the health care model may show similar 
16
positive outcomes in police accountability.
