A BILL 
To amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide 
hereditary cancer genetic testing for individuals with a 
history of a hereditary cancer gene mutation in a blood 
relative or a personal or ancestral history suspicious for 
hereditary cancer, and to provide coverage of certain 
cancer screenings or preventive surgeries that would re-
duce the risk for individuals with a germline (inherited) 
mutation associated with a high risk of developing a 
preventable cancer.
