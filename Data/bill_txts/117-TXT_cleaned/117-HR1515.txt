RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the draft United Nations General 
Assembly Resolution A/C.1/77/L.62 calling upon member 
states to commit not to conduct destructive direct-ascent 
anti-satellite missile tests, introduced by the United 
States at the 77th Session of the United Nations General 
Assembly. 
Whereas the United States is joined by countries around the 
world in relying on Earth-orbiting satellites for— 
(1) navigation; 
(2) communications; 
(3) financial transactions; 
(4) media broadcasting; 
(5) agriculture;

(6) detection and surveillance of threats and disas-
ters; 
(7) scientific research; and 
(8) monitoring and forecasting of environmental pa-
rameters, including— 
(A) weather; 
(B) ocean conditions; and 
(C) vegetation health; 
Whereas the United States is tracking more than 47,000 ob-
jects orbiting the Earth that are larger than 10 centi-
meters, an increase of 47 percent since January 2021, 
and further estimates a population of more than 
100,000,000 objects larger than 1 millimeter orbiting the 
Earth; 
Whereas orbital maneuvering to avoid collisions consumes on-
board propellant and shortens the lifespans of spacecraft 
missions; 
Whereas the proliferation of satellites and debris orbiting the 
Earth results in millions of potential collision warnings 
issued by the United States Space Command each year, 
while satellites and debris are expected to continue in-
creasing exponentially; 
Whereas destructive direct-ascent anti-satellite missile tests 
create large and dispersed orbiting debris fields that deny 
satellites access to needed orbital space and threaten to 
inadvertently destroy other satellites and spacecraft for 
decades after such tests; 
Whereas a destructive direct-ascent anti-satellite missile test 
conducted by the Russian Federation on November 15, 
2021, long after the dangers of orbital debris became well 
known, produced more than 1,500 pieces of identifiable

debris and threatened the safety of astronauts and cos-
monauts aboard the International Space Station; 
Whereas a destructive direct-ascent anti-satellite missile test 
conducted by the People’s Republic of China on January 
11, 2007, created at least 3,400 pieces of debris, of which 
79 percent is predicted to be in orbit 100 years after the 
event; 
Whereas the United States adopted a voluntary moratorium 
on the destructive testing of direct-ascent anti-satellite 
missile systems in April 2022; 
Whereas methods other than destructive direct-ascent anti- 
satellite tests are available to test defense capabilities; 
Whereas the international community has previously banned 
destructive activities in space, including the atmospheric 
testing of nuclear weapons; 
Whereas during a meeting of the Disarmament and Inter-
national Security Committee of the United Nations (UN) 
General Assembly, the United States introduced draft 
UN General Assembly Resolution A/C.1/77/L.62 calling 
upon member states to commit not to conduct destructive 
direct-ascent anti-satellite missile tests; 
Whereas on November 1, 2022, the Disarmament and Inter-
national Security Committee approved the draft resolu-
tion by a vote of 154 to 8, demonstrating broad inter-
national support for the efforts of the United States and 
sending it to the UN General Assembly for consideration; 
and 
Whereas 8 countries have followed the example of the United 
States and committed not to conduct destructive direct- 
ascent anti-satellite missile testing, including Canada in 
May 2022, New Zealand in July 2022, Germany in Sep-

with significant assets in space and that have pre-
