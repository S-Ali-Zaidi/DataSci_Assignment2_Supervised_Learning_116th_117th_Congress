•HR 4388 IH
(1) Presidential travel to commercial entities 
1
owned in whole or in part by the President or First 
2
Family results in the American taxpayer effectively 
3
subsidizing the President’s businesses. 
4
(2) President Trump spent more during his 
5
first four months in office than President Obama 
6
did, on average, in roughly two years. 
7
(3) It is unacceptable for the President to 
8
maintain an interest in traveling to properties in 
9
which he has a direct financial interest, as the U.S. 
10
Government is responsible for renting space for per-
11
sonnel in said private commercial entities. 
12
(4) Every time the President travels to Mar-a- 
13
Lago, he necessarily promotes his private business 
14
interests via free press at the Government’s expense. 
15
(5) The State Department’s promotion of Mar- 
16
a-Lago on its official website raises serious ethics 
17
concerns.
