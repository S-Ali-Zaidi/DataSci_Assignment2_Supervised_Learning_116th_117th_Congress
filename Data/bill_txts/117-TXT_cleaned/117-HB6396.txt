SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
3
Congress finds the following: 
4
(1) According to the 2018 National Climate As-
5
sessment, climate change due to global warming has 
6
caused, and is expected to continue to cause, sub-
7
stantial interference with and growing losses to 
8
human health and safety, infrastructure, property, 
9
industry, recreation, natural resources, agricultural 
10
systems, and quality of life in the United States. 
11
(2) According to the National Oceanic and At-
12
mospheric Administration, climate change is already 
13
increasing the frequency and severity of extreme 
14
weather and other climate-related disasters, includ-
15
ing drought, wildfire, and storms that include pre-
16
cipitation. 
17
(3) According to the National Oceanic and At-
18
mospheric Administration, in 2020, there were a 
19
record 22 weather and climate disasters costing 
20
$1,000,000,000 or more across the country, shat-
21
tering the prior annual record of 16. These events 
22
totaled $95,000,000,000 in damages. 
23
(4) Since 2015, the United States has experi-
24
enced more than 81 individual disasters, amounting 
25
04:04 Jan 21, 2022
H6396
dlhill on DSK120RN23PROD with BILLS
3 
•HR 6396 IH
to $630,200,000,000 in economic losses, and close to 
1
4,000 deaths. 
2
(5) Researchers have found that Black, Latino, 
3
and low-income families are more likely to live in 
4
high-risk areas like flood zones, less likely to have 
5
money to harden infrastructure and homes in ad-
6
vance of disasters, and less likely to receive assist-
7
ance during recovery periods. 
8
(6) According to Dr. Beverly Wright and Dr. 
9
Robert Bullard, ‘‘environmental and public health 
10
threats from natural and human-made disasters are 
11
not randomly distributed, affecting some commu-
12
nities more than others’’, and therefore our response 
13
to disasters necessitates the adoption of policies and 
14
processes rooted in principles of racial equity, self- 
15
determination, and democracy. 
16
(7) Research from the University of Colorado 
17
shows that the top 10 percent of disaster hotspots 
18
account for about 30 percent of the contiguous 
19
United States but are home to nearly 60 percent of 
20
buildings in the country. 
21
(8) According to testimony in November 2017 
22
from former Federal Emergency Management Agen-
23
cy Administrator Brock Long, ‘‘I cannot overstate 
24
the importance of focusing on investing in mitigation 
25
04:04 Jan 21, 2022
H6396
dlhill on DSK120RN23PROD with BILLS
4 
•HR 6396 IH
before a disaster strikes. Building more resilient 
1
communities is the best way to reduce risks to peo-
2
ple, property, and taxpayer dollars.’’. 
3
(9) The Government Accountability Office 
4
found that the Federal Emergency Management 
5
Agency spends 88 percent of its budget on 
6
postdisaster mitigation. 
7
(10) For fiscal year 2020 grant application 
8
cycle, the Federal Emergency Management Agency 
9
received nearly $4,000,000,000 in applications for 
10
their grant programs. However, in fiscal year 2020, 
11
the Federal Emergency Management Agency only 
12
made $700,000,000 available for predisaster mitiga-
13
tion. 
14
(11) Public-sector investment in mitigation 
15
since 1995 by the Federal Emergency Management 
16
Agency and the Housing and Urban Development 
17
Agency cost the country $27,000,000,000 but is pro-
18
jected to save $160,000,000,000, totaling $6 saved 
19
per $1 invested. 
20
(12) The United States has an opportunity to 
21
use disaster mitigation to minimize risk, improve re-
22
siliency, and address social problems.
