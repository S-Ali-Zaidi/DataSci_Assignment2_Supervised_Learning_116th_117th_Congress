1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
1
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Every eligible person who wishes to cast a 
3
ballot in a Federal election must be permitted to do 
4
so according to law, and their ballot must be exam-
5
ined according to law, and, if it meets all lawful re-
6
quirements, counted. 
7
(2) Congress has long required States to main-
8
tain Federal voter registration lists in a manner that 
9
promotes voter confidence. 
10
(3) The changes included herein are not in-
11
tended to be an expansion of Federal power but 
12
rather a clarification of State authority. 
13
(4) The Fifteenth Amendment, the Nineteenth 
14
Amendment, the Twenty-Fourth Amendment, and 
15
the Twenty-Sixth Amendment, among other ref-
16
erences, make clear that the Constitution prohibits 
17
voting by noncitizens in Federal elections. 
18
(5) Congress has the constitutional authority, 
19
including under the aforementioned amendments, to 
20
pass statutes preventing noncitizens from voting in 
21
Federal elections, and did so with the Illegal Immi-
22
gration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 
23
1996. 
24
(6) Congress may further exercise its constitu-
25
tional authority to ensure the Constitution’s prohibi-
26
22:43 Jun 22, 2022

•HR 7959 IH
tion on noncitizen voting in Federal elections is 
1
upheld. 
2
(7) Since the Constitution prohibits noncitizens 
3
from voting in Federal elections, such ineligible per-
4
sons must not be permitted to be placed on Federal 
5
voter registration lists. 
6
(8) Improper placement of an ineligible noncit-
7
izen on a Federal voter registration list leads to— 
8
(A) confusion on the part of the ineligible 
9
person with respect to their ineligibility to cast 
10
a ballot; and 
11
(B) an increased likelihood that human 
12
error will permit ineligible persons to cast bal-
13
lots in Federal elections. 
14
(9) State officials have confirmed that poorly 
15
maintained voter registration lists lead to ineligible 
16
persons casting ballots in Federal elections. 
17
(10) A former Broward County, Florida, elec-
18
tions supervisor has confirmed that ineligible non-
19
voters were able to cast ballots in previous elections 
20
and that she was not able to locate as many as 
21
2,040 ballots during the 2018 midterm recount. 
22
(11) This clarification of State authority to 
23
maintain Federal voter registration lists to ensure 
24
noncitizens are not included on such lists will pro-
25

•HR 7959 IH
mote voter confidence in election processes and out-
1
comes. 
2
(12) Congress has the authority to ensure that 
3
no Federal elections funding is used to support 
4
States that permit noncitizens to cast ballots in any 
5
election. 
6
(13) Federal courts and executive agencies have 
7
much of the information States may need to main-
8
tain their Federal voter registration lists, and those 
9
entities should make that information accessible to 
10
State election authorities. 
11
(14) It is important to clarify the penalty for 
12
any violation of law that allows a noncitizen to cast 
13
a ballot in a Federal election. 
14
(15) To protect the confidence of voters in Fed-
15
eral elections, it is important to implement the policy 
16
described herein. 
17
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
18
gress that— 
19
(1) allowing noncitizens to cast ballots in Amer-
20
ican elections weakens our electoral system and the 
21
value of citizenship and sows distrust in our elec-
22
tions system; 
23
22:43 Jun 22, 2022
H7959

•HR 7959 IH
(2) even if a State has the sovereign authority, 
1
no State should permit noncitizens to cast ballots in 
2
State or local elections; 
3
(3) States should use all information available 
4
to them to maintain Federal voter registration lists 
5
and should inform Congress if such data is insuffi-
6
cient; and 
7
(4) Congress may take further action in the fu-
8
ture to address this problem.
