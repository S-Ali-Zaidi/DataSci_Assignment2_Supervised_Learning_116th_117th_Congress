7
people free services and material items that were es-
8
timated to be worth approximately $270,000,000. 
9
(3) The services, which are generally provided 
10
at no cost to the patient, included almost 732,000 
11
pregnancy 
tests, 
more 
than 
486,000 
free 
12
ultrasounds, 160,200 STI/STD tests, offering more 
13
than 291,000 clients parenting and prenatal edu-
14

12

It is the sense of Congress that— 
6
(1) terror attacks against pregnancy centers, 
7
including arson, fire bombings, vandalism, and other 
8
property damage, violate section 248 of title 18, 
9
United States Code, and are punishable by fines and 
10
imprisonment; and 
11
(2) the Department of Justice, which is respon-
12
sible for investigating potential violations of section 
13
248 of title 18, United States Code, and prosecuting 
14
the individuals threatening, vandalizing, and dam-
