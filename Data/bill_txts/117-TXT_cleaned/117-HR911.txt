RESOLUTION 
Supporting the goals and ideals of ‘‘National Black HIV/ 
AIDS Awareness Day’’. 
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) estimates that in the United States more than 
1,189,000 people are living with HIV, and 13 percent do 
not know they are infected; 
Whereas in the United States, more than 700,000 people 
with AIDS have died since the beginning of the epidemic, 
including nearly 16,000 in 2018; 
Whereas each year nearly 40,000 people become newly diag-
nosed with HIV in the United States;

Whereas since the beginning of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in 
the United States, racial and ethnic minorities have been 
disproportionately affected by the disease; 
Whereas African Americans are diagnosed with AIDS later 
than their White counterparts, are confronted with great-
er barriers in accessing care and treatment, and face 
higher morbidity and mortality outcomes; 
Whereas African Americans account for nearly half of all 
those with AIDS who have died in the United States 
since the beginning of the epidemic; 
Whereas, in 2017, 2,620 African Americans died of HIV or 
AIDS, accounting for 47 percent of total deaths attrib-
uted to the disease that year; 
Whereas, in 2014, HIV/AIDS was the 6th leading cause of 
death for Black men overall and for Black women ages 
25 to 34, and the 5th for Black men ages 35 to 44 and 
4th for Black women ages 35 to 44, ranking higher than 
their respective counterparts in any other racial or ethnic 
group; 
Whereas, in 2018, African Americans represented 42 percent 
of all people living with HIV in the United States, despite 
comprising just 13 percent of the United States popu-
lation; 
Whereas, in 2018, over 16,000 African Americans were diag-
nosed with HIV; 
Whereas African-American gay and bisexual men are more 
affected by HIV than any other group in the United 
States, accounting for a higher proportion of HIV diag-
noses, those living with HIV, those ever diagnosed with 
AIDS, and HIV/AIDS-related deaths;

Whereas, in 2018, more than half of African Americans diag-
nosed with HIV were gay or bisexual men; 
Whereas, in 2018, among all gay and bisexual men who had 
received an HIV diagnosis, African Americans accounted 
for the highest number (39 percent); 
Whereas according to a 2016 study by the CDC, an esti-
mated half of Black gay men will be diagnosed with HIV 
in their lifetime, if current HIV diagnosis rates persist; 
Whereas homophobia, stigma, and discrimination pose major 
obstacles to HIV testing, treatment and other prevention 
services for gay and bisexual African-American men; 
Whereas data show a 22 percent decrease in new HIV infec-
tions among Black women between 2010 and 2019; 
Whereas among all women in the United States, Black 
women account for the largest share of 6,400 new HIV 
infections (3,400 or 53 percent) in 2019; 
Whereas African-American women face the highest risk of 
HIV and other sexually transmitted infections compared 
with women of other groups; 
Whereas the rate of new HIV infections among Black women 
(18.9 per 100,000) is nearly 11 times as high as the rate 
among White women (1.8 per 100,000) and nearly 4 
times as high as the rate among Latinas (4.9 per 
100,000); 
Whereas among African-American women, the leading trans-
mission category of HIV infection is heterosexual contact, 
followed by intravenous drug use; 
Whereas research indicates that the high incarceration rates 
of Black men may contribute to the disproportionate 
rates of HIV infections among Black women;

•HRES 911 IH 
Whereas, in 2010, the most recent data available, there were 
more than 20,000 inmates with HIV/AIDS in State and 
Federal prisons, a prevalence that is 4 times the rate of 
HIV in the general population; 
Whereas among incarcerated populations, African-American 
men are 5 times as likely as White men, and twice as 
likely as Hispanic/Latino men, to be diagnosed with HIV; 
Whereas among incarcerated populations, African-American 
women are more than twice as likely to be diagnosed with 
HIV as White or Hispanic/Latino women; 
Whereas transgender women in the United States are at high 
risk for HIV; 
Whereas more than half of all transgender people diagnosed 
with HIV are Black or African American; 
Whereas, in 2018, the South made up 51 percent of the new 
HIV diagnoses in the United States; 
Whereas African Americans are severely and disproportion-
ately affected by HIV in the South, accounting for 52 
percent of all new HIV infections in the region; 
Whereas socioeconomic issues impact the rates of HIV infec-
tion among African Americans in the South and through-
out the United States; 
Whereas socioeconomic factors like income inequality, pov-
erty, and lack of access to HIV prevention education and 
basic 
health 
services, 
and 
cultural 
factors 
like 
homophobia, transphobia, and racism all pose significant 
challenges to combating the HIV/AIDS epidemic; 
Whereas we are seeing signs of progress; 
Whereas, from 2014 to 2018, HIV diagnoses among African- 
American women fell by over 10 percent and have also 
21:27 Feb 04, 2022

•HRES 911 IH 
fallen sharply among African Americans who inject 
drugs; 
Whereas testing, education, counseling, and harm reduction 
practices are all critical to prevent HIV; 
Whereas life-saving treatment is also a proven prevention 
tool, and research shows that antiretroviral drugs can re-
duce the amount of virus to undetectable levels (also 
known as viral suppression), effectively resulting in no 
risk of transmission of HIV; 
Whereas, in 2012, the Food and Drug Administration ap-
proved preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) as prevention for 
people who are HIV-negative; 
Whereas PrEP can reduce the risk of HIV infection for HIV- 
negative people by up to 99 percent; 
Whereas, in 1998, Congress and the Clinton administration 
created the National Minority AIDS Initiative to help co-
ordinate funding, build capacity, and provide prevention, 
care, and treatment services within the African-American, 
Hispanic, Asian Pacific Islander, and Native American 
communities; 
Whereas the National Minority AIDS Initiative assists with 
leadership development of community-based organizations 
(CBOs), establishes and links provider networks, builds 
community prevention infrastructure, promotes technical 
assistance among CBOs, and raises awareness among Af-
rican-American communities; 
Whereas 2022 marks the twenty-fourth year of the National 
Minority AIDS Initiative which has successfully estab-
lished life-saving services and programs to address the 
needs of those communities, families, and individuals 
most impacted and burdened by HIV;

•HRES 911 IH 
Whereas, in 2010, the Obama administration unveiled the 
first National HIV/AIDS Strategy, which identified a set 
of priorities and strategic action steps tied to measurable 
outcomes for moving the Nation forward in addressing 
the domestic HIV epidemic; 
Whereas, in December 2021, the National HIV/AIDS Strat-
egy for the United States (2022–2025) was released and 
included actions and goals in order to reduce HIV-related 
disparities and inequalities; 
Whereas, in 2016, Prevention Access Campaign and commu-
nity members living with HIV launched the U=U move-
ment to build and communicate a consensus about the 
largely unknown fact that people living with HIV who are 
on treatment and have an undetectable viral load cannot 
sexually transmit HIV; 
Whereas, when people living with HIV are on treatment and 
have an undetectable viral load, they protect their own 
health, they cannot transmit HIV to their sexual part-
ners, and their HIV is untransmittable; 
Whereas, in 2013, the National Association for the Advance-
ment of Colored People (NAACP) released a manual of 
best practices for faith leaders to mobilize communities, 
advocate for community support for people infected with 
and affected by HIV/AIDS, and organize dialogues on 
HIV/AIDS as a social justice issue as part of ‘‘The Black 
Church and HIV: The Social Justice Imperative’’; 
Whereas the Affordable Care Act’s expansion of Medicaid 
and reforms to the individual insurance market have 
helped lower the uninsured rates for nonelderly African 
Americans by more than one-third between 2013 and

2016, leading to better health outcomes for African 
Americans living with or at risk of HIV; 
Whereas ‘‘National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day’’ was 
founded by 5 national organizations in 1999 to provide 
capacity-building assistance to Black communities and 
organizations; and 
Whereas each year on February 7, individuals, organizations, 
and policymakers across the Nation participate in ‘‘Na-
tional Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day’’ to promote HIV 
education, testing, community involvement, and treat-
ment in Black communities: Now, therefore, be it
