A BILL 
To enforce the Twenty-sixth Amendment, and for other 
purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Protect the Youth Vote 
4
Act of 2021’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) The right to vote is a fundamental right of 
8
citizens of the United States.

•HR 1366 IH
(2) The Twenty-sixth Amendment of the United 
1
States Constitution guarantees that ‘‘The right of 
2
citizens of the United States, who are eighteen years 
3
of age or older, to vote shall not be denied or 
4
abridged by the United States or by any State on 
5
account of age.’’. 
6
(3) The Twenty-sixth Amendment of the United 
7
States Constitution grants Congress the power to 
8
enforce the Amendment by appropriate legislation. 
9
(4) The language of the Twenty-sixth Amend-
10
ment closely mirrors that of the Fifteenth Amend-
11
ment and the Nineteenth Amendment. Like those 
12
Amendments, the Twenty-sixth Amendment not only 
13
prohibits denial of the right to vote but also pro-
14
hibits any actions that abridge the right to vote. 
15
(5) Youth voter suppression undercuts partici-
16
pation in our democracy by introducing arduous ob-
17
stacles to new voters and discouraging a culture of 
18
democratic engagement. 
19
(6) Voting is habit forming, and allowing youth 
20
voters unobstructed access to voting ensures that 
21
more Americans will start a life-long habit of voting 
22
as soon as possible. 
23
(7) Youth voter suppression is a clear, per-
24
sistent, and growing problem. The actions of States 
25
01:43 Mar 31, 2021
H1366
3 
•HR 1366 IH
and political subdivisions resulting in at least four 
1
findings of Twenty-sixth Amendment violations as 
2
well as pending litigation demonstrate the need for 
3
Congress to take action to enforce the Twenty-sixth 
4
Amendment. 
5
(8) In League of Women Voters of Florida, Inc. 
6
v. Detzner (2018), the United States District Court 
7
in the Northern District of Florida found that the 
8
Secretary of State’s actions that prevented in-person 
9
early voting sites from being located on university 
10
property revealed a stark pattern of discrimination 
11
that was unexplainable on grounds other than age 
12
and thus violated university students’ Twenty-sixth 
13
Amendment rights. 
14
(9) In 2019, Michigan agreed to a settlement to 
15
enhance college-age voters’ access after a Twenty- 
16
sixth Amendment challenge was filed in federal 
17
court. The challenge prompted the removal of a 
18
Michigan voting law which required first time voters 
19
who registered by mail or through a third-party 
20
voter registration drive to vote in person for the first 
21
time, as well as the removal of another law which re-
22
quired the address listed on a voter’s driver license 
23
to match the address listed on their voter registra-
24
tion card.

•HR 1366 IH
(10) Youth voter suppression tactics are often 
1
linked to other tactics aimed at minority voters. For 
2
example, students at Prairie View A&M University 
3
(PVAMU), a historically Black university in Texas, 
4
have been the targets of voter suppression tactics for 
5
decades. Before the 2018 election, PVAMU students 
6
sued Waller County on the basis of both racial and 
7
age discrimination over the County’s failure to en-
8
sure equal early voting opportunities for students, 
9
spurring the County to reverse course and expand 
10
early voting access for students. 
11
(11) The more than 25 million United States 
12
citizens ages 18–24 deserve equal opportunity to 
13
participate in the electoral process as guaranteed by 
14
the Twenty-sixth Amendment. 
15
SEC. 3. PREVENTING AGE DISCRIMINATION IN VOTING. 
16
(a) RIGHT TO VOTE.—No voting qualification or pre-
17
requisite to voting or standard, practice, or procedure shall 
18
be imposed or applied by any State or political subdivision 
19
in a manner which results in a denial or abridgement of 
20
the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on 
21
account of age, as provided in subsection (b). 
22
(b) VIOLATION OF RIGHT TO VOTE.— 
23
(1) IN GENERAL.—A violation of subsection (a) 
24
is established if, based on the totality of cir-
25
01:43 Mar 31, 2021
H1366
5 
•HR 1366 IH
cumstances, it is shown that the political processes 
1
leading to nomination or election in the State or po-
2
litical subdivision are not equally open to participa-
3
tion by members of a class of citizens protected by 
4
subsection (a) in that its members have less oppor-
5
tunity than other members of the electorate to par-
6
ticipate in the political process and to elect rep-
7
resentatives of their choice: Provided, That nothing 
8
in this section establishes a right to have members 
9
of a protected class under subsection (a) elected in 
10
numbers equal to their proportion in the population. 
11
(2) VIOLATIONS.—A violation under subsection 
12
(a) shall include: 
13
(A) Laws or requirements implemented in 
14
a State or political subdivision that reduce or 
15
abridge the ability for students who attend an 
16
institution of higher education and reside in the 
17
jurisdiction of the institution while attending 
18
the institution to register to vote in elections in 
19
that jurisdiction. 
20
(B) Addition of seats elected at-large in a 
21
State or political subdivision or conversion of 
22
one or more seats elected from a single member 
23
district to one or more at-large seats or seats 
24
from a multi-member district in a State or po-

designed to reduce the proportion of the polit-
4
ical subdivision’s voting-age population that is 
5
comprised of youth age voters in a State or po-
6
litical subdivision with a significant proportion 
7
of youth age voters. 
8
(D) Requirements for documentation or 
9
proof of identity to vote that exceed or are more 
10
stringent than the requirements for voting that 
11
are described in section 303(b) of the Help 
12
America Vote Act of 2002 (52 U.S.C. 
13
21083(b)) or any other requirements for docu-
14
mentation or proof of identity to vote that have 
15
the purpose or effect of denying or abridging 
16
the right to vote on account of age. 
17
(E) Reduction of voting materials or alter-
18
nation of the manner in which such materials 
19
are provided or distributed at institutions of 
20
higher education, where no similar reduction or 
21
alteration occurs in materials provided at other 
22
sites for such election. 
23

24
tion of voting locations, including early, absen-

SEC. 4. FEDERAL OBSERVERS TO PREVENT AGE DISCRIMI-
4
NATION. 
5
(a) FEDERAL OBSERVERS.—Whenever the Attorney 
6
General or an aggrieved person institutes a proceeding 
7
under any statute to enforce the voting guarantees of the 
8
Twenty-sixth Amendment in any State or political subdivi-
9
sion the court shall authorize the appointment of Federal 
10
observers by the United States Office of Personnel Man-
11
agement to serve for such period of time and for such po-
12
litical subdivisions as the court shall determine is appro-
13
priate to enforce the voting guarantees of the Twenty- 
14
sixth Amendment (1) as part of any interlocutory order 
15
if the court determines that the appointment of such ob-
16
servers is necessary to enforce such voting guarantees or 
17
(2) as part of any final judgment if the court finds that 
18
violations of the Twenty-sixth Amendment, violations of 
19
this Act, or violations of any Federal law that prohibits 
20
discrimination in voting on the basis of age, justifying eq-
21
uitable relief have occurred in such State or subdivision: 
22
Provided, That the court need not authorize the appoint-
23
ment of observers if any incidents of denial or abridgement 
24
of the right to vote on account of age, (1) have been few 
25

in number and have been promptly and effectively cor-
1
rected by State or local action, (2) the continuing effect 
2
of such incidents has been eliminated, and (3) there is no 
3
reasonable probability of their recurrence in the future. 
4
(b) JURISDICTION.—If any action under any statute 
5
in which a party (including the Attorney General) seeks 
6
to enforce the voting guarantees of the Twenty-sixth 
7
Amendment in any State or political subdivision the court 
8
finds that violations of the Twenty-sixth Amendment, vio-
9
lations of this Act, or violations of any Federal law that 
10
prohibits discrimination in voting on the basis of age, jus-
11
tifying equitable relief have occurred within the territory 
12
of such State or political subdivision, the court, in addition 
13
to such relief as it may grant, shall retain jurisdiction for 
14
such period as it may deem appropriate and during such 
15
period no voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or 
16
standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting dif-
17
ferent from that in force or effect at the time the action 
18
was commenced shall be enforced unless and until the 
19
court finds that such qualification, prerequisite, standard, 
20
practice, or procedure does not have the purpose and will 
21
not have the effect of denying or abridging the right to 
22
vote on account of age: Provided, That such qualification, 
23
prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure may be en-
24
forced if the qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice,

•HR 1366 IH
or procedure has been submitted by the chief legal officer 
1
or other appropriate official of such State or subdivision 
2
to the Attorney General and the Attorney General has not 
3
interposed an objection within sixty days after such sub-
4
mission, except that neither the court’s finding nor the 
5
Attorney General’s failure to object shall bar a subsequent 
6
action to enjoin enforcement of such qualification, pre-
7
requisite, standard, practice, or procedure. 
8
(c) ENFORCEMENT BY ATTORNEY GENERAL.—The 
9
Attorney General is authorized to monitor and enforce the 
10
voting guarantees of the Twenty-sixth Amendment, viola-
11
tions of this Act, or violations of any Federal law that 
12
prohibits discrimination in voting on the basis of age, 
13
whenever Federal observers are appointed under any pro-
14
vision of Federal law.

SEC. 5. DETERMINATION OF VOTING RIGHTS VIOLATION. 
16
For purposes of this Act, a voting rights violation oc-
17

18
lowing applies: 
19
(1) FINAL JUDGEMENT; VIOLATION OF TWEN-
20
TY-SIXTH AMENDMENT.—In a final judgment (which 
21
has not been reversed on appeal), any court of the 
22
United States has determined that a denial or 
23
abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United 
24
States to vote on account of age, in violation of the 
25
01:43 Mar 31, 2021

1
the State or subdivision. 
2
(2) FINAL JUDGEMENT; VIOLATIONS OF THIS 
3
ACT.—In a final judgment (which has not been re-
4
versed on appeal), any court of the United States 
5
has determined that a voting qualification or pre-
6
requisite to voting or standard, practice, or proce-
7
dure with respect to voting was imposed or applied 
8
or would have been imposed or applied anywhere 
9
within the State or subdivision in a manner that re-
10
sulted or would have resulted in a denial or 
11
abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United 
12

13
tion 3. 
14
(3) FINAL JUDGEMENT; DENIAL OF DECLARA-
15
TORY JUDGEMENT.—In a final judgment (which has 
16
not been reversed on appeal), any court of the 
17
United States has denied the request of the State or 
18
subdivision for a declaratory judgment under section 
19
3(b), and thereby prevented a voting qualification or 
20
prerequisite to voting or standard, practice, or pro-
21
cedure with respect to voting from being enforced 
22
anywhere within the State or subdivision. 
23
(4) OBJECTION BY ATTORNEY GENERAL.—The 
24
Attorney General has interposed an objection under 
25
01:43 Mar 31, 2021
H1366
11 
•HR 1366 IH
section 3(b) (and the objection has not been over-
1
turned by a final judgment of a court or withdrawn 
2
by the Attorney General), and thereby prevented a 
3
voting qualification or prerequisite to voting or 
4
standard, practice, or procedure with respect to vot-
5
ing from being enforced anywhere within the State 
6
or subdivision.
