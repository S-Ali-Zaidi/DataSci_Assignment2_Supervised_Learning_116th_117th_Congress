1
OWNER EMPOWERMENT PILOT PROGRAM. 
2
(a) IN GENERAL.—The Administrator of the Federal 
3
Emergency Management Agency shall carry out a pilot 
4
program to make grants to units of local government to 
5
enhance the mapping of urban flooding and associated 
6
property damage and the availability of such mapped data 
7
to homeowners, businesses, and units of local government 
8
to enable them to minimize the risk of such flooding. 
9
(b) OBJECTIVES.—Amounts from grants made under 
10
the pilot program under this section may be used only to 
11
carry out activities to meet the following objectives: 
12
(1) To develop a methodology for assessing 
13
urban flood risk through the deployment of tech-
14
nology-based mapping tools that are easily under-
15
standable by the public and effectively convey infor-
16
mation regarding the level of flood risk. 
17
(2) To provide structure-specific projections of 
18
annual chance flood frequency. 
19
(3) To provide structure-based flood-risk assess-
20
ments. 
21
(4) To provide urban flood-risk mitigation pro-
22
gram design. 
23
(5) To incorporate information regarding cli-
24
mate trends into urban flooding risk assessments.

nologies to mitigate the effects of urban flooding. 
6
(l) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Congress 
7
that, because the pilot program is limited with respect to 
8
scope and resources, communities that participate in the 
9
pilot program should acknowledge that the most successful 
10
efforts to mitigate the effects of urban flooding— 
11
(1) take a structural-based mitigation approach 
12
with respect to construction, which includes— 
13
(A) recognizing any post-storm damage 
14
that may occur; and 
15
(B) pursuing designs that proactively mini-
16
mize future flood damage; 
17
(2) make individuals in the community aware, 
18
through any cost-effective and available means of 
19
education, of the best approaches regarding the con-
20
struction of properties that are able to survive 
21
floods, which reduces the cost of future repairs; and 
22
(3) encourage home and property owners to 
23
consider the measures described in paragraphs (1) 
24
and (2), which are the most cost-effective and pru-
25
