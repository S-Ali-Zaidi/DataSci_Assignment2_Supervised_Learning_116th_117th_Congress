SEC. 2. PURPOSE AND FINDINGS. 
6
(a) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act is to increase 
7
the base exemption used by the Social Security Adminis-
8
tration in determining the annual earnings limit for early

retirees before monthly benefits are reduced. This legisla-
1
tion would increase the annual earnings limitation to 
2
$30,000 (or $2,500 per month for less than full year cal-
3
culations) for the year 2023 and adjusted for wage infla-
4
tion in the following years as required by current law. 
5
(b) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) Allowing early retirees to earn more while 
7
retaining their Social Security benefits will have no 
8
impact on the solvency of the program because, 
9
under current law, any reductions in benefits for ex-
10
cess earnings are returned to the beneficiary after 
11
attaining full retirement age through increased 
12
monthly benefits. 
13
(2) Increasing the earning limit for Social Secu-
14
rity beneficiaries will result in the potential for in-
15
creased collection of FICA taxes used to fund the 
16
program.

by striking ‘‘the taxable year ending after 1993 
10

12

13
