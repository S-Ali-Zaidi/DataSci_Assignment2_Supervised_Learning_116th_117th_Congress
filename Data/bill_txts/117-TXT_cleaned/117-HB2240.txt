(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 2 years after the 
5
date of enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General 
6

11
jections on whether the enactment, full funding, 
12
and implementation of particular Federal legis-
13
lation are likely to cause a net increase or de-
14
crease in global greenhouse gas emissions over 
15
a specified period; and 
16
(B) to quantify any such projected increase 
17
or decrease; and 
18
(2) submit a report to the Congress containing

13
generation; transportation; residential, commer-
14
cial, and industrial fuel use; natural gas and oil 
15
systems; coal mining and abandoned mines; ag-
