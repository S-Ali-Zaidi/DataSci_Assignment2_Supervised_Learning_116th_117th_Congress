CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY FOR ENACT-

MENT. 
8
Congress finds and declares the following: 
9
(1) Medical and other authorities now know 
10
more about human prenatal development than ever 
11
before including that— 
12
(A) an unborn child begins to move about 
13
in the womb and reacts to touch at approxi-
14
mately 8 weeks gestation; 
15
(B) the eyes begin to form at 5 weeks ges-
16
tation and finish forming by 10 weeks gesta-
17
tion; eye movements can be detected by 
18
ultrasound at 12 weeks gestation; 
19
(C) by 8 to 9 weeks gestation, the unborn 
20
child has detectable brain waves;

•HR 8814 IH
(D) at 9 weeks gestation, an unborn child’s 
1
diaphragm is developing, and he or she may 
2
even hiccup, and he or she is beginning to move 
3
about freely in the womb; 
4
(E) at 9 to 11 weeks gestation, teeth as 
5
well as external genitalia begin to form; 
6
(F) by 10 weeks gestation all of an unborn 
7
child’s organ rudiments are formed and in 
8
place, the digestive system and kidneys start to 
9
function at this time, and the unborn child will 
10
show a preference for either right handedness 
11
or left handedness; 
12
(G) at 12 weeks gestation, an unborn child 
13
can open and close his or her fingers, starts to 
14
make sucking motions, senses stimulation from 
15
the world outside the womb, and fingernails and 
16
fingerprints begin to form; and 
17
(H) the Supreme Court has acknowledged 
18
that, by at least 12 weeks gestation, an unborn 
19
child has taken on ‘‘the human form’’ in all rel-
20
evant aspects (Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 U.S. 
21
124, 160 (2007)). 
22
(2) Pain receptors (nociceptors) begin forming 
23
at 7 weeks gestational age. Nerves linking these pain 
24
receptors to the brain’s thalamus and subcortical 
25
01:48 Sep 15, 2022
H8814
4 
•HR 8814 IH
plate form between 12 and 20 weeks gestational age. 
1
It is no later than 16 weeks gestational age that the 
2
first contact occurs between the subcortical plate 
3
and these forming fibers. 
4
(3) In considering the use of anesthesia for 
5
invasive medical procedures performed on the fetus, 
6
evidence has concluded that from as early as 12 
7
weeks, and certainly by 15 weeks gestational age on-
8
ward, the fetus is extremely sensitive to painful 
9
stimuli, making it necessary to apply adequate anal-
10
gesia and anesthesia to prevent fetal suffering. 
11
(4) Substantial evidence indicates that neural 
12
elements, such as the thalamus and subcortical 
13
plate, develop at specific times during the early de-
14
velopment of an unborn child, serve as pain-proc-
15
essing structures, and are different from the neural 
16
elements used for pain processing by adults. Recent 
17
evidence, particularly since 2016, demonstrates that 
18
structures responsible for pain show signs of suffi-
19
cient maturation from 15 weeks of gestation and 
20
thereafter. 
21
(5) In the unborn child, application of such 
22
painful stimuli is associated with significant in-
23
creases in stress hormones known as the stress re-
24
sponse. 
25
01:48 Sep 15, 2022
H8814
5 
•HR 8814 IH
(6) Subjection to such painful stimuli is associ-
1
ated with long-term harmful neurodevelopmental ef-
2
fects, such as altered pain sensitivity and, possibly, 
3
emotional, behavioral, and learning disabilities later 
4
in life. 
5
(7) For the purposes of surgery on unborn chil-
6
dren, fetal anesthesia is routinely administered and 
7
is associated with a decrease in stress hormones 
8
compared to their level when painful stimuli are ap-
9
plied without such anesthesia. 
10
(8) The assertion by some medical experts that 
11
the unborn child is incapable of experiencing pain 
12
until a point in pregnancy later than 24 weeks ges-
13
tational age predominately rests on the assumption 
14
that the ability to experience pain depends on the 
15
cerebral cortex and requires nerve connections be-
16
tween the thalamus and the cortex. However, recent 
17
medical research and analysis, especially since 2007, 
18
provides strong evidence for the conclusion that a 
19
functioning cortex is not necessary to experience 
20
pain. 
21
(9) Substantial evidence indicates that children 
22
born missing the bulk of the cerebral cortex, such as 
23
those with hydranencephaly, nevertheless experience 
24
pain. 
25
01:48 Sep 15, 2022
H8814
6 
•HR 8814 IH
(10) In adult humans and in animals, stimula-
1
tion or ablation of the cerebral cortex does not alter 
2
pain perception, while stimulation or ablation of the 
3
thalamus does. 
4
(11) The assertion of some medical experts that 
5
the unborn child remains in a coma-like sleep state 
6
that precludes the unborn child from experiencing 
7
pain is inconsistent with the documented reaction of 
8
unborn children to painful stimuli and with the expe-
9
rience of fetal surgeons who have found it necessary 
10
to sedate an unborn child with anesthesia and pro-
11
vide analgesia to prevent the unborn child from en-
12
gaging in vigorous movement in reaction to invasive 
13
surgery. 
14
(12) Consequently, there is substantial medical 
15
evidence that an unborn child is capable of experi-
16
encing pain at least by 15 weeks gestational age, if 
17
not earlier. 
18
(13) Abortion carries significant physical and 
19
psychological risks to the pregnant woman, and 
20
these physical and psychological risks increase with 
21
gestational age. 
22
(14) The majority of abortion procedures per-
23
formed after 15 weeks gestation are dismemberment 
24
abortion procedures which involve the use of surgical 
25
01:48 Sep 15, 2022
H8814
7 
•HR 8814 IH
instruments to crush and tear the unborn child 
1
apart before removing the pieces of the dead child 
2
from the womb. 
3
(15) Medical complications from dismember-
4
ment abortions include, but are not limited to, pelvic 
5
infection; incomplete abortions (retained tissue); 
6
blood clots; heavy bleeding or hemorrhage; lacera-
7
tion, tear, or other injury to the cervix; puncture, 
8
laceration, tear, or other injury to the uterus; injury 
9
to the bowel or bladder; depression; anxiety; sub-
10
stance abuse; and other emotional or psychological 
11
problems. Further, in abortions performed after 15 
12
weeks gestation, there is a higher risk of requiring 
13
a hysterectomy, other reparative surgery, or blood 
14
transfusion. 
15
(16) Subparagraphs (J) and (K) of section 
16
2(14) of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 
17
(Public Law 108–105; 117 Stat. 1202) find that a 
18
late-term abortion, such as a dismemberment abor-
19
tion, ‘‘confuses the medical, legal, and ethical duties 
20
of physicians to preserve and promote life, as the 
21
physician acts directly against the physical life of a 
22
child’’ and ‘‘undermines the public’s perception of 
23
the appropriate role of a physician’’.

•HR 8814 IH
(17) ‘‘The [United States Supreme] Court has 
1
given state and federal legislatures wide discretion to 
2
pass legislation in areas where there is medical and 
3
scientific uncertainty’’ that ‘‘the law need not give 
4
abortion doctors unfettered choice in the course of 
5
their medical practice, nor should it elevate their 
6
status above other physicians in the medical commu-
7
nity,’’ and that ‘‘medical uncertainty does not fore-
8
close the exercise of legislative power in the abortion 
9
context any more than it does in other contexts,’’ 
10
(Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 U.S. at 124). 
11
(18) The Supreme Court has held that ‘‘It is 
12
time to heed the Constitution and return the issue 
13
of abortion to the people’s elected representatives’’. 
14
(Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, 
15
142 S. Ct. 2228, 2243 (2022)). 
16
(19) It is the purpose of the Congress to assert 
17
a compelling governmental interest in protecting the 
18
lives of unborn children from the stage at which sub-
19
stantial medical evidence indicates that they are ca-
20
pable of feeling pain. 
21
(20) The Supreme Court has also held that ‘‘a 
22
law regulating abortion, like other health and wel-
23
fare laws, is entitled to a ‘strong presumption of va-
24
lidity.’ . . . It must be sustained if there is a rational

basis on which the legislature could have thought 
1
that it would serve legitimate state interests. . . . 
2
These legitimate interests include respect for and 
3
preservation of prenatal life at all stages of develop-
4
ment . . . ; the protection of maternal health and 
5
safety; the elimination of particularly gruesome or 
6
barbaric medical procedures; the preservation of the 
7
integrity of the medical profession; the mitigation of 
8
fetal pain; and the prevention of discrimination on 
9
the basis of race, sex, or disability.’’ (Dobbs v. Jack-
10
son Women’s Health Organization, 142 S. Ct. at 
11
2239). 
12
(21) Congress has authority to extend protec-
13
tion to pain-capable unborn children under the Su-
14
preme Court’s Commerce Clause precedents and 
15
under the Constitution’s grants of powers to Con-
16
gress under the Equal Protection, Due Process, and 
17
Enforcement Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.
