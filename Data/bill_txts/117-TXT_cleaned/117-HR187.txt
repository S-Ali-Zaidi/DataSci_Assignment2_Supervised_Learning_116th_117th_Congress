Whereas approximately 48 million Americans have some de-
gree of hearing loss and people with hearing impairments 
wait on average 7 years before seeking help; 
Whereas hearing issues are the most common service-con-
nected disability among American veterans; 
Whereas the number of adults in the United States 20 years 
or older with hearing loss is expected to increase from 
44.1 million in 2020 to 73.5 million by 2060; 
Whereas individuals with mild hearing loss are 3 times more 
likely to experience a fall, and falls are the leading cause 
of fatal injury for Americans over 65; 
Whereas seniors with hearing loss are more likely to develop 
cognitive problems and experience cognitive decline up to 
40 percent faster than those without hearing loss; 
Whereas untreated hearing loss can lead to depression, anx-
iety, and social isolation, especially during the coronavi-
rus (COVID–19) pandemic; 
Whereas uneven coverage of and access to hearing technology 
and services contribute to significant disparities in hear-
ing care; and 
Whereas timely access to diagnosis and treatment for hearing 
and vestibular conditions by qualified hearing health care 
professionals can improve outcomes and reduce overall 
cost of care: Now, therefore, be it
