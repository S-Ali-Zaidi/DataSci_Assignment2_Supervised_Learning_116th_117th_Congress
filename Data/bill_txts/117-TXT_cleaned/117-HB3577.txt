SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
17
Congress finds the following: 
18
(1) In World War II, the Army formed 6 Rang-
19
er Battalions and 1 provisional battalion. All mem-
20
bers of the Ranger Battalions were volunteers. The 
21
initial concept of Ranger units drew from the British 
22
method of using highly trained ‘‘commando’’ units 
23
and the military tradition of the United States of 
24
utilizing light infantry for scouting and raiding oper-
25
ations.

(2) The Ranger Battalions of World War II 
1
consisted of— 
2
(A) the 1st Ranger Infantry Battalion, 
3
which was activated on June 19, 1942, in 
4
Northern Ireland; 
5
(B) the 2d Ranger Infantry Battalion, 
6
which was activated on April 1, 1943, at Camp 
7
Forrest, Tennessee; 
8
(C) the 3d Ranger Infantry Battalion, 
9
which was— 
10
(i) activated as provisional on May 21, 
11
1943, in North Africa; and 
12
(ii) constituted on July 21, 1943, and 
13
concurrently consolidated with the provi-
14
sional unit described in clause (i); 
15
(D) the 4th Ranger Infantry Battalion, 
16
which was— 
17
(i) activated as provisional on May 29, 
18
1943, in North Africa; and 
19
(ii) constituted on July 21, 1943, and 
20
concurrently consolidated with the provi-
21
sional unit described in clause (i); 
22
(E) the 5th Ranger Infantry Battalion, 
23
which was activated on September 1, 1943, at 
24
Camp Forrest, Tennessee; 
25

•HR 3577 IH
(F) the 6th Ranger Infantry Battalion, 
1
which was— 
2
(i) originally activated on January 20, 
3
1941, at Fort Lewis, Washington, as the 
4
98th Field Artillery Battalion; and 
5
(ii) converted and redesignated on 
6
September 26, 1944, as the 6th Ranger 
7
Infantry Battalion; and 
8
(G) the 29th Ranger Infantry Battalion, a 
9
provisional Army National Guard unit that 
10
was— 
11
(i) activated on December 20, 1942, 
12
at Tidworth Barracks, England; and 
13
(ii) disbanded on October 18, 1943. 
14
(3) The first combat operations of Army Rang-
15
ers occurred on August 19, 1942, when 50 Rangers 
16
took part in the British-Canadian raid on the 
17
French coastal town of Dieppe. 
18
(4) The 1st Ranger Battalion, under the leader-
19
ship of Major William O. Darby, was used in full 
20
strength during the landings at Arsew, Algeria, dur-
21
ing the North African campaign. Due to the success 
22
of the Rangers in several difficult battles, particu-
23
larly at El Guettar in March and April of 1943, 2 
24
06:37 Jun 22, 2021

•HR 3577 IH
additional Ranger Battalions were organized in 
1
North Africa. 
2
(5) During the North African campaign, the 1st 
3
Ranger Battalion was awarded battle honors for its 
4
actions in Tunisia. On March 18, 1943, the Bat-
5
talion penetrated enemy lines and captured the posi-
6
tion Djebel el Auk in a nighttime attack, taking 
7
more than 200 prisoners. Two days later, the bat-
8
talion was attacked by the 10th Panzer division of 
9
the German Afrika Korps and, despite heavy losses, 
10
continued to defend its position. The following day, 
11
the 1st Battalion counterattacked to clear high 
12
ground overlooking the positions held by the Armed 
13
Forces. These actions demonstrated the ability of 
14
the Rangers to fight in difficult terrain and the 
15
courage to endure despite being outnumbered and 
16
exposed to heavy enemy fire. 
17
(6) The 29th provisional Ranger Battalion was 
18
formed from volunteers drawn from the 29th Infan-
19
try Division stationed in England in the fall of 1942. 
20
The Battalion was activated on December 20, 1942, 
21
and accompanied British commandos on 2 small- 
22
scale raids in Norway. Nineteen members of the 
23
29th Ranger Battalion conducted a raid on a Ger-
24
man radar site in France on the night of September 
25
06:37 Jun 22, 2021

•HR 3577 IH
3, 1943. After that raid, the 29th Ranger Battalion 
1
was disbanded because new Ranger units, the 2d 
2
and 5th Battalions, were being formed. 
3
(7) During the summer and fall of 1943, the 
4
1st, 3d, and 4th Ranger Battalions were heavily in-
5
volved in the campaign in Sicily and the landings in 
6
Italy. The 1st and 4th Ranger Battalions conducted 
7
a night amphibious landing in Sicily and secured the 
8
landing beaches for the main force. The 3d Bat-
9
talion landed separately at Licata, Sicily, and was 
10
able to silence gun positions on an 82-foot cliff over-
11
looking the invasion beaches. 
12
(8) During the invasion of Italy, the 1st and 
13
4th Ranger Battalions landed at Maiori with the 
14
mission of seizing the high ground and protecting 
15
the flank of the remainder of the main landing by 
16
the United States. Enemy forces in the area were es-
17
timated to outnumber the Rangers by approximately 
18
8 to 1. Despite these odds, the Rangers took the po-
19
sition and held off 7 enemy counterattacks. 
20
(9) After the invasion of Italy, Rangers contin-
21
ued to be used, often in night attacks, to seize key 
22
terrain ahead of the advancing Allied forces. At the 
23
Anzio beachhead, the majority of the 1st, 3d, and 
24
4th Ranger Battalions sustained heavy casualties 
25

after being cut off behind German lines. The Rang-
1
ers had planned to infiltrate German positions under 
2
the cover of darkness and make a dawn attack on 
3
a critical road junction but were pinned down by 
4
enemy tanks and an elite German paratrooper unit. 
5
After 12 hours of desperate fighting and a failed re-
6
lief attempt, the majority of the Ranger force was 
7
killed, wounded, or captured. Only 6 Rangers from 
8
the 1st and 3d Battalions, out of more than 767 
9
men, returned to friendly lines. The 4th Battalion, 
10
which had been in reserve, also suffered 60 killed 
11
and 120 wounded out of 550 men. These 3 battal-
12
ions were inactivated and the survivors were trans-
13
ferred to other units. 
14
(10) In the United States, and later in Scot-
15
land, the 2d and 5th Ranger Battalions were formed 
16
to undertake operations in Western Europe. Those 
17
Battalions were engaged on D-Day, assaulting Ger-
18
man positions at the Pointe du Hoc coastal battery, 
19
and remained in combat through September of 
20
1944. Specifically, Rangers in the 2d Battalion, 
21
under the command of Lieutenant Colonel James E. 
22
Rudder—

(A) overcame underwater mines, machine 
1
gun fire, and enemy artillery while scaling the 
2
100-foot high cliffs at Pointe du Hoc; 
3
(B) held against intense German efforts to 
4
retake the position; and 
5
(C) after reaching the top of the cliffs, 
6
moved inland roughly 1 mile and sustained 
7
heavy casualties while searching for, and ulti-
8
mately destroying, a German heavy artillery 
9
battery. 
10
(11) During June, July, and August of 1944, 
11
the 2d and 5th Ranger Battalions were engaged in 
12
the campaign in Brest, which included close-range 
13
fighting in hedgerows and numerous villages. Later, 
14
in operations in Western Germany, the Battalions 
15
were frequently used to attack in darkness and gain 
16
vital positions to pave the way for the main Army 
17
attacks. 
18
(12) During the final drive into Germany in 
19
late February and early March 1945, the 5th Rang-
20
er Battalion was cited for battle honors for out-
21
standing performance. Under the cover of darkness, 
22
the unit drove into German lines and seized high 
23
ground blocking the main German supply route in 
24
the sector. The Germans attacked the position of the 
25
06:37 Jun 22, 2021
H3577
9 
•HR 3577 IH
Rangers from both sides, resulting in heavy Ranger 
1
casualties during 5 days of fighting. As a result of 
2
the actions of the Rangers, the main Army attack 
3
was able to overcome German defenses more easily, 
4
occupy the vital city of Trier, and reach the Rhine 
5
River. 
6
(13) The 6th Ranger Battalion operated in the 
7
Pacific. In the most notable exploit of the 6th Rang-
8
er Battalion, in January and February of 1945, the 
9
Battalion formed the nucleus of a rescue force that 
10
liberated more than 500 Allied prisoners, including 
11
prisoners from the United States, from the Caba-
12
natuan prisoner of war camp in the Philippines. 
13
With the help of local Filipino guerillas, the Rang-
14
ers, led by Lieutenant Colonel Henry A. Mucci, dem-
15
onstrated extraordinary heroism by infiltrating Jap-
16
anese-held territory to reach the prisoners of war 
17
and prevent them from being killed by the Japanese. 
18
After a 25-mile march at night through the jungle, 
19
the unit killed all Japanese sentries with no loss of 
20
life of the prisoners of war. The unit successfully re-
21
turned to American lines having lost only 2 soldiers 
22
killed and having another 2 wounded.
