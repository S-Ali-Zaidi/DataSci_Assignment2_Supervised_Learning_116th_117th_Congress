SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress makes the following findings: 
2
(1) The founding principles of the United 
3
States include the belief, enshrined in the Declara-
4
tion of Independence, that ‘‘all men are created 
5
equal’’ and ‘‘are endowed by their Creator with cer-
6
tain unalienable Rights’’. 
7
(2) The United States commitment to the equal 
8
dignity and natural rights of all mankind is the 
9
strongest possible defense against racism and op-
10
pression of all kinds. 
11
(3) The mission of the United States Armed 
12
Forces is to ‘‘support and defend the Constitution of 
13
the United States against all enemies, foreign and 
14
domestic’’ and ‘‘bear true faith and allegiance to the 
15
same’’. 
16
(4) To carry out this mission, the Armed 
17
Forces must train leaders who love the United 
18
States, its citizens, and the aforementioned founding 
19
principles. 
20
(5) Anti-American and racist theories, such as 
21
‘‘Critical Race Theory’’, teach that the United 
22
States is a fundamentally racist Nation, that the 
23
Constitution is a fundamentally racist document, 
24
and that certain races are fundamentally oppressive 
25
or oppressed.

(6) Such theories encourage people to judge 
1
and treat others differently on the basis of their 
2
race, rather than treating them as equal citizens and 
3
human beings with equal dignity and protection 
4
under the law. 
5
(7) Anti-American and racist theories, such as 
6
Critical Race Theory, teach students to distrust and 
7
even hate their country and fellow citizens. 
8
(8) The United States Armed Forces should not 
9
promote or otherwise encourage anti-American and 
10
racist theories that demoralize and divide its mem-
11
bers while undermining its mission to ‘‘bear truth 
12
faith and allegiance’’ to the Constitution.
