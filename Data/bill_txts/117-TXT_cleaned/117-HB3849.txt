•HR 3849 IH

businesses.

change to an interoperability interface maintained by

the covered platform that will affect the interoper-

18
trast, location, the length of time it appears, 
19
and other characteristics, must stand out from

so that it is easily noticed, read, and under-
22
stood.

24
telephone or streaming video, must be delivered

1
ordinary consumers to easily hear and under-
2
stand it.

4
active electronic medium, such as the Internet 
5
or software, the disclosure must be unavoidable. 
6
(E) The disclosure must use diction and 
7
syntax understandable to ordinary consumers 
8
and must appear in each language in which the 
9
triggering representation appears. 
10
(F) The disclosure must comply with these 
11
requirements in each medium through which it 
12
is received, including all electronic devices and 
13
face-to-face communications. 
14
(G) The disclosure must not be contra-
15
dicted or mitigated by, or inconsistent with, 
16
anything else in the communication. 
17
(H) When the representation or sales prac-
18
tice targets a specific audience, such as chil-
19
dren, the elderly, or the terminally ill, ‘‘ordinary 
20
consumers’’ includes reasonable members of 
21

16
age entry by reducing or eliminating the network ef-
17
fects that limit competition with the covered plat-

to interoperability.

reasonably proportional to the cost, complexity, and

risk to the covered platform of providing such ac-
13
