RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the duty of the Federal Government to imple-
ment an agenda to Transform, Heal, and Renew by 
Investing in a Vibrant Economy (‘‘THRIVE’’). 
Whereas families and communities throughout the United 
States share similar hopes and dreams of a good life that 
is free from worry about meeting basic needs, with reli-
able and fulfilling work, a dignified and healthy standard 
of living, and the ability to enjoy time with loved ones;

Whereas the United States faces the stress of multiple, over-
lapping crises—old and new—that prevent the achieve-
ment of these fundamental human rights and needs, in 
which the COVID–19 pandemic has killed over 400,000 
United States residents; more than 10,000,000 United 
States workers remain unemployed; rising economic in-
equality has made working families vulnerable; tens of 
millions of individuals do not get the health care they 
need; and intensifying climate change increases the 
threats to our health, economy, and livelihoods; 
Whereas these health, economic, and climate crises have mag-
nified centuries-old injustices, causing high rates of death 
and hardship among Black, Brown, and Indigenous com-
munities due to long-standing systemic racism—a fact 
spotlighted by an emerging, multiracial movement to end 
violence against Black people; 
Whereas these crises are causing the inequitable workloads of 
women—particularly women of color—to grow, especially 
as women of color overwhelmingly make up the essential 
workforce, bearing the weight of the increased care needs 
of children, the elderly, and the sick; 
Whereas, even before the COVID–19 crisis, many rural com-
munities and independent family farmers suffered from 
poverty, declining economic opportunity, and alarming 
rates of farm bankruptcy, including loss of land from 
Black farmers and the exploitation of Black, Brown, and 
Indigenous farmers caused by predatory and racist pub-
lic, private, and governmental institutions and policies; 
Whereas the root of our interlocking economic and environ-
mental crises is society’s historical willingness to treat 
some communities and workers as disposable; 
22:18 Feb 13, 2021

•HRES 104 IH 
Whereas it is necessary to counteract systemic injustice and 
value the dignity of all individuals in order to address un-
employment, pandemics, or climate change and ensure 
the survival of the Nation and the planet; 
Whereas the choices made in response to these crises will 
shape the United States direction for the 21st century 
and beyond, offering an opportunity to reshape our soci-
ety to provide a good life for each of us and for our chil-
dren and grandchildren; and 
Whereas the United States has the means to support ful-
filling livelihoods for millions of people—Black, Indige-
nous, Brown, Latinx, Asian/Pacific Islander, White, im-
migrant, urban and rural, old and young, of many faiths, 
genders, abilities, and talents—while working to heal 
harms, protect communities, and invest in a future that 
fosters justice, not crisis: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-
