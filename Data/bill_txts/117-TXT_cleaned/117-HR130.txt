RESOLUTION 
Condemning the continued violation of rights and freedoms 
of the people of Hong Kong by the People’s Republic 
of China and the Government of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region. 
Whereas despite international condemnation, the Government 
of the People’s Republic of China (‘‘PRC’’) continues to 
disregard its international legal obligations under the 
Joint Declaration of the Government of the United King-
dom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Gov-
ernment of the People’s Republic of China on the Ques-
tion of Hong Kong (‘‘Joint Declaration’’), in which the 
PRC committed that— 
(1) Hong Kong would enjoy a high degree of auton-
omy;

(2) for at least 50 years the ‘‘social and economic 
systems in Hong Kong’’ would remain unchanged; and 
(3) the personal rights and freedoms of the people 
of Hong Kong would be protected by law; 
Whereas, as part of its continued efforts to undermine the es-
tablished rights of the Hong Kong people, the PRC Na-
tional People’s Congress Standing Committee (‘‘Standing 
Committee’’) passed and imposed upon Hong Kong op-
pressive and intentionally vague national security legisla-
tion on June 30, 2020, that grants Beijing sweeping 
powers to punish acts of ‘‘separating the country, sub-
verting state power, and organizing terroristic activities’’; 
Whereas the legislative process by which the Standing Com-
mittee imposed the national security law on Hong Kong 
bypassed Hong Kong’s local government in a potential 
violation of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Ad-
ministrative Region of the People’s Republic of China 
(‘‘Basic Law’’), and involved unusual secrecy, as dem-
onstrated by the fact that the legislation was only the 
second law since 2008 that the Standing Committee has 
passed without releasing a draft for public comment; 
Whereas, on July 30, 2020, election officials of the Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) disquali-
fied twelve pro-democracy candidates from participating 
in the September 6 Legislative Council elections, which 
were subsequently postponed for a year until September 
5, 2021, by citing the public health risk of holding elec-
tions during the COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas, on July 31, 2020, in an attempt to assert 
extraterritorial jurisdiction, the HKSAR Government an-
nounced indictments of and arrest warrants for six Hong 
Kong activists living overseas, including United States

citizen Samuel Chu, for alleged violations of the national 
security law; 
Whereas, on November 11, 2020, the HKSAR Government 
removed four lawmakers from office for allegedly vio-
lating the law after the Standing Committee passed addi-
tional legislation barring those who promoted or sup-
ported Hong Kong independence and refused to acknowl-
edge PRC sovereignty over Hong Kong, or otherwise vio-
lates the national security law, from running for or serv-
ing in the Legislative Council; 
Whereas, on December 2, 2020, pro-democracy activists 
Joshua Wong, Agnes Chow, and Ivan Lam were sen-
tenced to prison for participating in 2019 protests; 
Whereas ten of the twelve Hong Kong residents (also known 
as ‘‘the Hong Kong 12’’) who sought to flee by boat from 
Hong Kong to Taiwan on August 23, 2020, were taken 
to mainland China and sentenced on December 30, 2020, 
to prison terms ranging from seven months to three years 
for illegal border crossing; 
Whereas, on December 31, 2020, Hong Kong’s highest court 
revoked bail for Jimmy Lai Chee-Ying, a pro-democracy 
figure and publisher, who was charged on December 12 
with colluding with foreign forces and endangering na-
tional security under the national security legislation; 
Whereas, on January 4, 2021, the Departments of Justice in 
Henan and Sichuan province threatened to revoke the li-
censes of two lawyers hired to help the Hong Kong 12; 
and 
Whereas, on January 5, 2021, the Hong Kong Police Force 
arrested more than fifty opposition figures, including pro- 
democracy officials, activists, and an American lawyer,
