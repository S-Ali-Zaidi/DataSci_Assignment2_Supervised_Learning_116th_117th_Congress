(a) CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY STATEMENT.— 
7
This section is enacted pursuant to the power conferred 
8
by the Constitution of the United States upon each House 
9
of Congress by— 
10
(1) article I, section 5, clauses 2 and 3 to deter-
11
mine the rules and keep a journal of its proceedings, 
12
respectively;

(2) article I, section 7, clause 2 to ensure that

2
article III, section 2 of the Constitution of the United

States. 
4
(c) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) The Constitution of the United States vests 
6
all legislative powers granted therein in Congress. 
7
(2) Each Member of Congress is elected by the 
8
people to whom the Member is accountable, and 
9
Members must represent the people of their respec-
10
tive State or District in exercising their legislative 
11
powers. 
12
(3) Establishing a Government of enumerated 
13
powers, article I, section 1 of the Constitution of the 
14
United States obliges Congress to exercise only those 
15
legislative powers provided for in the Constitution of 
16
the United States, and article VI of the Constitution 
17
of the United States requires that each Member of 
18
Congress be bound by oath or affirmation to support 
19
the Constitution of the United States by enacting 
20
only those laws, and making only those resolutions, 
21
that are pursuant to the Constitution of the United 
22
States and not prohibited thereby. 
23
(4) To ensure that Congress is politically and 
24
legally accountable to the people, article I, section 5 
25
15:37 Feb 14, 2021
H470
14 
•HR 470 IH
of the Constitution of the United States requires 
1
each House of Congress to keep a journal of its pro-
2
ceedings and from time to time publish the same. 
3
(5) To ensure that no legislation is passed with-
4
out effective representation of the interests of the 
5
people by the elected Members of Congress, article 
6
I, section 7 of the Constitution of the United States 
7
provides that only a bill ‘‘which shall have passed 
8
the House of Representatives and the Senate,’’ and 
9
not vetoed by the President, shall ‘‘become a law’’. 
10
(6) According to section I of the Manual of 
11
Parliamentary Practice for the Use of the Senate of 
12
the United States, written by Thomas Jefferson in 
13
1801 (referred to in this section as ‘‘Jefferson’s 
14
Manual’’), ‘‘nothing tended more to throw power 
15
into the hands of administration and those who 
16
acted with the majority . . . than a neglect of, or 
17
departure from, the rules of proceeding [which] op-
18
erated as a check and control of the actions of the 
19
majority [and] a shelter and protection to the minor-
20
ity’’. 
21
(7) According to sections XXII and XL of Jef-
22
ferson’s Manual, it was the rule of the Senate that 
23
every bill receive 3 readings, 2 full readings by the 
24
Clerk of the Senate, and a third reading of the title 
25
15:37 Feb 14, 2021

15 
•HR 470 IH
of the bill only, because ‘‘every member of the Sen-
1
ate had a printed copy [of the bill] in his hand.’’. 
2
(8) According to sections XXIV, XXV, and XL 
3
of Jefferson’s Manual, it was the rule of the House 
4
of Representatives, following the parliamentary pro-
5
cedure of the English House of Commons, that every 
6
bill receive 2 full readings by the Clerk of the House 
7
of Representatives, and a reading of the whole con-
8
tents of the bill verbatim by the Speaker of the 
9
House of Representatives before the House of Rep-
10
resentatives voted on the bill. 
11
(9) Under the current rules of the Senate, the 
12
Senate has departed from its original practice of a 
13
full first and second reading of each bill, and of en-
14
suring that each Senator has a printed or other ver-
15
batim copy of each bill before passage thereof, hav-
16
ing by rule XIV of the Standing Rules of the Senate 
17
limited each reading of a bill to the reading of the 
18
title of the bill only, unless the Senate in any case 
19
shall otherwise order. 
20
(10) Under the current rules of the House of 
21
Representatives, the House of Representatives has 
22
by rule XVI (8) and rule XVIII (5) embraced its 
23
original practice of full first and second readings of 
24
each bill, but has regularly departed from this prac-

•HR 470 IH
tice by unanimous consent of the House of Rep-
1
resentatives, and has dispensed altogether its origi-
2
nal practice of a verbatim third reading of each bill 
3
before passage, limiting such third reading to the 
4
reading of the title only, including the reading of the 
5
title only even when Members of the House of Rep-
6
resentatives have no printed or other verbatim copy 
7
of the bill before passage. 
8
(11) Although section 106 of title 1, United 
9
States Code, requires a bill to be made available in 
10
written form to each Member of Congress before 
11
final passage, Congress has by statute conferred 
12
upon itself the power, during the last 6 days of a 
13
session of Congress, by concurrent resolution, to 
14
vote for passage of a bill that is not in written form 
15
at the time of final passage. 
16
(12) As a direct consequence of the departure 
17
of the Senate and the House of Representatives 
18
from the salutary practice of full, verbatim readings 
19
of each bill before final passage, and further, as a 
20
direct consequence of Congress, by concurrent reso-
21
lution and otherwise, having permitted certain ap-
22
propriation, budget, and regulatory bills to be en-
23
acted into law without such bills being printed and

passage, Congress has— 
2
(A) imposed upon the people of the United 
3
States excessively long bills, largely written by 
4
an unelected bureaucracy, resulting in generally 
5
incomprehensible, cumbersome, oppressive, and 
6
burdensome laws, containing hidden provisions 
7
for special interests; 
8
(B) deprived the people of the United 
9
States and their elected Senators and Members 
10
of a full and fair opportunity to examine the 
11
text of bills, and all amendments thereto, prior 
12
to passage;

ments thereto; and 
18
(D) has called into question the integrity 
19
and reliability of the legislative processes in 
20
both Houses of Congress by its failure to en-
