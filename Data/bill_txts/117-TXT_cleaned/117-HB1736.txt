(1) Beyond Traffic 2045, a comprehensive as-
1
sessment of the national transportation system re-
2
cently published by the Department of Transpor-
3
tation, identified transportation trends that need to 
4
be proactively addressed, including— 
5
(A) the population of the United States 
6
will increase by 70,000,000 during the 30-year 
7
period ending in 2045; 
8
(B) emerging megaregions could absorb 75 
9
percent of the United States population by 
10
2050; 
11
(C) freight volume will increase by more 
12
than 40 percent by 2045; 
13
(D) Americans are currently stuck in traf-
14
fic for more than 42 hours each year, on aver-
15
age; 
16
(E) the current annual cost of congestion 
17
in 
delays 
and 
lost 
fuel 
amounts 
to 
18
$160,000,000,000; 
19
(F) 96 people die in motor vehicle crashes 
20
in the United States every day, on average, and 
21
nearly 6,700 are injured per day; and

3
tation, in 2015— 
4
(A) traffic crash-related deaths increased

(3) In 2015, the Secretary of Transportation 
11
created the Smart City Challenge to assist cities in 
12
addressing the challenges facing our Nation’s trans-
13
portation system through innovative and creative 
14
means, utilizing both the public and the private sec-
15
tors. 
16
(4) By asking American cities to use emerging 
17
transportation technologies to address their most 
18
pressing problems, the Smart City Challenge aimed 
19
to spark and spread innovation through a mixture of 
20
collaboration, competition, and experimentation. 
21
(5) The following outcomes were expected from 
22
the original Smart City Challenge and are expected 
23
to result from the SMART grants awarded under
