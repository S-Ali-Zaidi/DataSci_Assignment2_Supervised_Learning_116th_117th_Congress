12
MENT ON DETERMINATION.—In conducting the eval-
13
uation under paragraph (1), the Commission may 
14
not determine that spectrum usage rights are unuti-
15
lized or underutilized if— 
16
(A) in the case of a license that contains 
17
terms regarding when the licensee is required to 
18
deploy infrastructure or to begin utilizing such 
19
spectrum usage rights, the licensee is in compli-
20
ance with such terms; or

the Commission determines in the evaluation con-

evaluation, issue a recommendation to the licensee 
13
that the licensee lease such unutilized or underuti-
14
lized spectrum usage rights to other entities for the 
15
provision of broadband service in such area, in ac-
16
cordance with subpart X of part 1 of title 47, Code

CENSE SIZES.—It is the sense of Congress that, in issuing 
20
any covered license (except for a renewal of such a li-

22
area in which such license permits the use of spectrum 
23
is as small as feasible, as determined by the Commission.
