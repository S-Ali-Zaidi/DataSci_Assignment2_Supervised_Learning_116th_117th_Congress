A BILL 
To establish Federal policies and procedures to notify the 
next-of-kin or other emergency contact upon the death, 
or serious illness or serious injury, of an individual in 
Federal custody, to provide model policies for States, 
units of local government, and Indian Tribes to imple-
ment and enforce similar policies and procedures, and 
for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Family Notification 
2
of Death, Injury, or Illness in Custody Act of 2021’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) In the event an individual dies or becomes 
6
seriously ill or injured while being detained, ar-
7
rested, or while in law enforcement custody, their 
8
family members deserve to be notified in a timely 
9
and compassionate manner. Such notification is nec-
10
essary to uphold the basic human dignity of incar-
11
cerated people, a concept rooted in the Eighteenth 
12
Amendment and Due Process Clause of the Four-
13
teenth Amendment. 
14
(2) The lack of a national standard governing 
15
notification of death, illness, and injury that occur 
16
in prisons, jails and police custody can lead to inhu-
17
mane treatment of incarcerated people and their 
18
loved ones. Poor communication regarding the death 
19
of a loved one may exacerbate the grief and other 
20
physical and psychological reactions of surviving rel-
21
atives. 
22
(3) On Easter Sunday of 2016, Wakiesha Wil-
23
son was found dead in her cell in the Los Angeles 
24
Police Department’s Metropolitan Detention Center. 
25
Her mother called the police to determine Ms. Wil-
26
23:31 Dec 23, 2021
H6296
3 
•HR 6296 IH
son’s whereabouts but was not initially given any in-
1
formation. It was not until March 30, 3 days later, 
2
when Ms. Wilson’s mother was told to call the cor-
3
oner that she learned her daughter had died. 
4
(4) In Georgia, Jennifer Bradley testified before 
5
the General Assembly in September 2021 that she is 
6
still waiting for answers about the stabbing death of 
7
her 23-year-old son at Macon State Prison in March 
8
2020. She told the committee that it was an incar-
9
cerated person, not a prison official, who first noti-
10
fied her of her son’s death. As of the hearing, she 
11
had not yet received his belongings. 
12
(5) Jordan Fisher found out about the death of 
13
her father, Thomas Willis, at Valdosta State Prison 
14
in Georgia when a letter she had sent her father was 
15
returned back to her stamped: ‘‘Return to sender: 
16
inmate dead’’. She was unable to obtain further in-
17
formation about her father’s death from prison offi-
18
cials. What information she uncovered came from 
19
letters from her father’s cellmate. 
20
(6) Sara Roth did not receive notice from the 
21
Clayton County Jail in Georgia that her mother, Re-
22
gina Salman, had fallen and suffered serious inju-
23
ries, including a collapsed lung that required hos-
24
pitalization. When her mother’s longtime boyfriend 
25
23:31 Dec 23, 2021
H6296
4 
•HR 6296 IH
went to visit the jail, he was told Ms. Salman was 
1
no longer there but was not provided additional in-
2
formation. More than a month later, the hospital 
3
called Ms. Roth and informed her that her mother 
4
was on a ventilator and dying of a severe brain 
5
tumor. Her mother was taken off the ventilator 3 
6
days later without ever regaining consciousness. 
7
(7) The failure to release autopsy results can 
8
prevent families and loved ones from seeking justice 
9
for wrongful deaths. After Harvey Hill was arrested 
10
for trespassing and booked into jail in Canton, Mis-
11
sissippi, guards beat him severely and kicked him re-
12
peatedly in the head. Mr. Hill died in an isolation 
13
cell. The State medical examiner’s report recorded 
14
his death as a homicide, but it was not released until 
15
25 months after his death and 13 months after the 
16
statute of limitations expired for assault. 
17
(8) In recent years, deaths in custody have 
18
reached the highest levels on record. In 2018, two 
19
years prior to the rapid spread of COVID–19 behind 
20
bars, at least 1,120 people died while detained in 
21
local jails and 4,513 people died in the custody of 
22
State and Federal prisons. This represented an all- 
23
time high in the number of deaths in both local jails 
24
23:31 Dec 23, 2021
H6296
5 
•HR 6296 IH
and State prisons since the Bureau of Justice Sta-
1
tistics (BJS) started collecting mortality data. 
2
(9) The spread of COVID–19 behind bars sig-
3
nificantly increased the death toll of people in cus-
4
tody. At least 2,700 people are estimated to have 
5
died of COVID–19 in prisons, jails and detention 
6
centers, and the COVID–19 death rate in State and 
7
Federal prisons between April 2020 and April 2021 
8
was more than double that of the general population. 
9
This is likely a significant undercount, given uneven 
10
and inconsistent reporting. In some instances, people 
11
are released from local jails to die in hospitals, 
12
whether of COVID–19 or other causes, and their 
13
deaths are not recorded as a death in custody.
