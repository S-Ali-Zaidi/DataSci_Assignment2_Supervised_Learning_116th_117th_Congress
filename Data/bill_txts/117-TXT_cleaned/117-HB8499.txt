Secretary of Energy, the Administrator of the Envi-

10
Interior, the Secretary of Transportation, the Chair 
11
of the Council on Environmental Quality, and the

Chair of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
13
to address greenhouse gas emissions, including the 
14
regulation or prohibition of the exploration, mining, 
15
production, and use of coal and other fossil fuels as 
16
energy sources, the social cost of greenhouse gases, 
17
specifically the social cost of carbon, the social cost 
18
of methane, and the social cost of nitrous oxide, rep-
19
resents the hypothetical cost of 1 incremental ton of 
20
carbon dioxide, methane, or nitrous oxide emissions

(B) instructs Federal agencies to include

discount rates of 3 and 7 percent and evaluate 
10
the costs and benefits of the regulatory action 
11
that accrue to citizens and residents of the 
12
United States;

working group that included the Department of En-
15

17

18
of carbon and the subsequently developed social cost 
19
of methane and social cost of nitrous oxide fail to 
20
comply with the 3- and 7-percent discount rates pre-

rying out an evaluation of the global effects of a

rule, regulation, or action, the evaluation shall be re-
5
ported separately from domestic costs and benefits 
6
of that rule, regulation, or action, the social cost of
