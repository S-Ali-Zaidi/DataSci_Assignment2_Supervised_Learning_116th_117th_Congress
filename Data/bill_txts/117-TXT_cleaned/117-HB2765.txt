A BILL 
To promote equity in advanced coursework and programs 
at elementary and secondary schools. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Advanced Coursework 
4
Equity Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. PURPOSE. 
6
The purposes of this Act are— 
7
(1) to expand access to advanced courses and 
8
programs at under-resourced elementary and sec-
9
ondary schools;

(2) to advance equitable enrollment practices, 
1
so that all students who are ready to engage in more 
2
rigorous coursework can benefit from advanced 
3
courses and programs; and 
4
(3) to equip dramatically more students, espe-
5
cially students from historically underrepresented 
6
groups, with the twenty-first century skills needed to 
7
succeed in college and a competitive global work-
8
force.

SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
10
Congress finds the following: 
11
(1) Black, Latino, and Native American stu-
12
dents, students with disabilities, and students from 
13
low-income families are underrepresented in ad-
14
vanced programs and courses. 
15
(2) While 1 in 10 students in schools in the 
16
United States participate in the Advanced Place-
17
ment (AP) program, just over 1 in 20 low-income, 
18
Black, and Native American students participate in 
19
Advanced Placement, and fewer than 1 in 50 stu-
20
dents with disabilities participate. 
21
(3) Taking the mathematics course Algebra I in 
22
grade 8 is necessary for most students to be on 
23
track for enrolling in advanced courses, such as Cal-
24
culus, in high school; however, Black students are 
25
23:07 Jun 04, 2021
H2765

•HR 2765 IH
half as likely as White students to take Algebra I in 
1
grade 8. 
2
(4) A low-income student with reading and 
3
math achievement levels equal to those of a high-in-
4
come student is half as likely to receive gifted serv-
5
ices as the high-income student. Black students are 
6
approximately half as likely as White peers with the 
7
same mathematics and reading achievement levels to 
8
be referred to gifted services. 
9
(5) A major barrier for Black and Latino stu-
10
dents and students with disabilities to access ad-
11
vanced courses and programs is the over-reliance on 
12
subjective criteria, such as the recommendation of 
13
teachers and counselors, in the advanced course ad-
14
mittance process. When Denver Public Schools im-
15
plemented universal screening for gifted and talented 
16
programs, Latino students were identified for the 
17
program at twice the rate as the year before. 
18
(6) Just 1 in 12 students in the United States 
19
scored in the top 2 proficiency levels on the 2018 
20
PISA 
math 
assessment. 
This 
is 
below 
the 
21
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Devel-
22
opment (OECD) average and less than half the rate 
23
of South Korea, Japan, and Switzerland.

(7) Public elementary schools and secondary 
1
schools face a $305,000,000,000 budget shortfall 
2
due to COVID-19 related tax revenue decreases and 
3
new COVID-19 related expenses. As school districts 
4
prepare to make drastic cuts to educational pro-
5
gramming, access to advanced coursework and pro-
6
grams is in jeopardy for millions of students, espe-
7
cially students from underrepresented groups and 
8
students attending under-resourced schools. Addi-
9
tional funding and reforms are needed to maintain 
10
and expand access to advanced coursework and pro-
11
grams, especially for marginalized students in com-
12
munities hit hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic.
