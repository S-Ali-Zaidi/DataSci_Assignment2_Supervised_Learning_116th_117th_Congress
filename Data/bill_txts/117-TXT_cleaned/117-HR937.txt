(5) Education.

(7) Energy and environment. 
(8) Immigration. 
(9) Technical innovation. 
(10) Defense and veterans. 
Whereas the United States is the greatest, most benevolent, 
most prosperous, and most successful country in the his-
tory of human civilization; 
Whereas the Constitution of the United States, which has en-
dured for nearly a quarter of a millennium, is a towering 
and unparalleled achievement that has made the United 
States the world’s oldest democracy and oldest inde-
pendent constitutional republic; 
Whereas the United States is built on the rule of law and in-
stitutional equality; 
Whereas the rights of the people of the United States derive 
from natural law and are transcendent and inalienable; 
our rights do not derive from any temporal authority, 
government, national origin, or any racial or ethnic iden-
tification; this vision is as revolutionary today as it was 
almost 250 years ago; 
Whereas the United States tradition of principled pluralism 
has allowed it to become a bastion of civil rights and in-
dividual liberty as evidenced by the abolition of slavery, 
women’s suffrage, and the success of free market cap-
italism; 
Whereas the United States helped bring an end to World 
War I, defeated totalitarianism in World War II, imple-
mented the Marshall Plan, and defeated Soviet Com-

munism in the Cold War, making America and the world 
more free, prosperous, and secure; 
Whereas the United States constitutional Government and 
the free enterprise system it enables is the key to our fu-
ture freedom and prosperity, and is the world’s best hope 
for confronting 21st-century economic, technological, so-
cial, and political challenges; 
Whereas no economic system has lifted more people out of 
poverty than the free enterprise system; 
Whereas Socialist policies have failed catastrophically, par-
ticularly in United States cities, and inflicted enormous 
economic pain and injustice on predominantly middle to 
lower income families and minority communities; 
Whereas policymakers have a moral and institutional respon-
sibility to create the conditions for the creation of 21st- 
century jobs for American workers; 
Whereas United States national security depends on its eco-
nomic security, which is imperiled by the Federal Govern-
ment’s unsustainable fiscal course and national debt; 
Whereas Congress should restore regular order, end the era 
of ‘‘omnibus’’ spending bills, and aspire to consider legis-
lation that addresses one subject with one bill in a man-
ner that it is targeted, transparent, and comprehensible 
to the public; 
Whereas the House of Representatives is the People’s House 
and should be accessible and open to ensure that every 
citizen has a right to petition their government; 
Whereas the United States health care system is operating 
within an antiquated regulatory framework created in 
1942 that is incompatible with the 21st-century economy;

•HRES 937 IH 
Whereas the problem in health care is not that the free mar-
ket has failed; the problem is it has never been tried; 
Whereas patients in the United States are demanding free-
dom, choice, and control; 
Whereas socialized, government-run health care systems like 
those in the United Kingdom would be cruelly inefficient 
and lead to rationing; 
Whereas the reckless, irresponsible, and ineffective Green 
New Deal suggests a permanent lockdown on the Amer-
ican economy not unlike the economic duress of COVID– 
19, grant Communist China a competitive advantage, and 
inflict injustice on American communities through higher 
energy prices all while doing nothing to reduce global 
temperatures; 
Whereas using concerns about climate to advance unrelated 
Socialist goals like government-run health care and uni-
versal basic income is an irresponsible tactic that delays 
reforms that can improve environmental stewardship; 
Whereas an ‘‘all of the above’’ energy policy that utilizes re-
newables, nuclear energy, and fossil fuels is superior to 
an ‘‘everything but’’ policy that naively and dangerously 
undermines American energy independence; 
Whereas hydraulic fracking, a private sector innovation, has 
done more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions than any 
other innovation or government regulation in the past 
two decades; 
Whereas free economies are clean economies; 
Whereas central planning traps people in poverty and slows 
innovation;

•HRES 937 IH 
Whereas a carbon tax is a coercive and counterproductive 
government mechanism that would delay the development 
and deployment of clean energy technology; 
Whereas the Democrats’ climate alarmism is intellectually 
dishonest based on their unwillingness to take immediate 
action; 
Whereas the First Amendment guarantees of free speech and 
free expression of thought are essential to developing ef-
fective policies that advance the public good and facilitate 
the peaceful resolution of conflict; 
Whereas illiberalism or ‘‘cancel culture’’ is anti-intellectual, 
anti-American, and a rejection of the foundational prin-
ciples of pluralism; 
Whereas the Second Amendment was created to protect the 
First Amendment; 
Whereas failing schools for American children is the foremost 
civil liberties issue in American society, and parents must 
have the right to choose the best educational opportunity 
for their own child; 
Whereas China is set to overtake the United States as the 
global leader in key categories if the United States fails 
to advance a bold freedom agenda; 
Whereas China is actively working to build a strategic alli-
ance with totalitarian and antidemocratic states like Iran, 
Russia, and North Korea; and 
Whereas the Democrats’ failed border policy is a threat to 
the Nation’s security and the rule of law: Now, therefore,
