than 200,000 individuals in the United States; 
Whereas more than 7,000 rare diseases affect approximately 
30,000,000 people in the United States and their fami-
lies; 
Whereas children with rare diseases account for a significant 
proportion of the population affected by rare diseases; 
Whereas many rare diseases are serious, life-threatening, and 
lack an effective treatment;

Whereas rare diseases and conditions cross the medical spec-
trum; 
Whereas individuals with rare diseases experience challenges 
that include difficulty in obtaining an accurate diagnosis, 
limited treatment options, and difficulty finding physi-
cians or treatment centers with expertise in their disease; 
Whereas although over 840 drugs and biologics have been ap-
proved for the treatment of rare diseases by the Food 
and Drug Administration, millions of people in the 
United States have rare diseases for which there is no 
approved treatment; 
Whereas lack of effective treatments and difficulty in obtain-
ing reimbursement for life-altering and often lifesaving 
treatments remain significant challenges for individuals 
with rare diseases and their families; 
Whereas as a result of the Orphan Drug Act, there have been 
important advances in research on and treatment for rare 
diseases; 
Whereas the Food and Drug Administration has taken great 
strides in gathering patient perspectives to inform the 
drug review process as part of its Patient-Focused Drug 
Development program, an initiative that was reaffirmed 
under the Food and Drug Administration Reauthoriza-
tion Act of 2017; 
Whereas the 115th Congress passed a 10-year extension of 
the Children’s Health Insurance Program, ensuring cov-
erage for many children with rare diseases; 
Whereas both the Food and Drug Administration and the 
National Institutes of Health have established special of-
fices to support and facilitate rare disease research and 
treatments;

Whereas the National Organization for Rare Disorders spon-
sors ‘‘Rare Disease Day’’ in the United States and part-
ners with many other major rare disease organizations to 
increase public awareness of rare diseases; 
Whereas ‘‘Rare Disease Day’’ is observed each year on the

Whereas ‘‘Rare Disease Day’’ was observed in the United 
States for the first time on February 28, 2009, and ob-
served in more than 100 countries in 2019; and
