A BILL 
To amend the Fair Credit Reporting Act to ban the use 
of credit information for most employment decisions, and 
for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Restricting Credit 
4
Checks for Employment Decisions Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) The use of credit reports as a factor in 
8
making hiring decisions has been found to be preva-
9
lent in a diverse array of occupations, and is not

limited to certain high-level management or execu-
1
tive positions. 
2
(2) According to the California Labor Federa-
3
tion, only 25 percent of employers researched the 
4
credit history of job applicants in 1998. However, 
5
this practice had increased to 43 percent by 2006 
6
and to 60 percent by 2011. 
7
(3) A study titled ‘‘Do Job Applicant Credit 
8
Histories Predict Job Performance Appraisal Rat-
9
ings or Termination Decisions?’’, published in 2012, 
10
found that, while credit history might conceptually 
11
measure a person’s level of responsibility, ability to 
12
meet deadlines, dependability, or integrity, it does 
13
not, in practice, actually predict an employee’s per-
14
formance or likelihood to quit. Credit reports contain 
15
many inaccuracies and credit history can be con-
16
taminated by events that are sometimes outside a 
17
person’s control, such as a sudden medical expense 
18
after an accident or the loss of a job during an eco-
19
nomic downturn. The study found that there is no 
20
benefit from using credit history to predict job per-
21
formance or turnover. 
22
(4) Despite the absence of data showing a cor-
23
relation between job performance and credit-worthi-
24
ness, employers continue to use credit checks as a 
25

proxy for assessing character and integrity. Accord-
1
ing to a 2012 Society for Human Resource Manage-
2
ment survey, organizations indicated that they used 
3
credit checks on job candidates primarily to reduce 
4
or prevent theft and embezzlement and to minimize 
5
legal liability for negligent hiring. 
6
(5) The use of credit checks for employment 
7
purposes creates a true ‘‘catch-22’’ for unemployed 
8
people with impaired credit. For example, the finan-
9
cial hardship caused by losing a job may cause some 
10
unemployed individuals to make late or partial pay-
11
ments on their bills, but their poor credit standing 
12
caused by this negative information on their con-
13
sumer report can also impede their chances of ob-
14
taining a new job to end their financial distress. 
15
(6) A September 2014 report by the New York 
16
City Council’s Committee on Civil Rights noted that, 
17
for those who have been unemployed for an extended 
18
period of time and whose credit has suffered as they 
19
fell behind on bills, the use of credit reports in the 
20
hiring process can exacerbate and perpetuate an al-
21
ready precarious situation. 
22
(7) In a March 2013 Demos report titled ‘‘Dis-
23
credited: How Employment Credit Checks Keep Out 
24
Qualified Workers Out of a Job’’, one in four survey 
25

•HR 4144 IH
participants who were unemployed said that a poten-
1
tial employer had requested to check their credit re-
2
port as part of a job application. Among job appli-
3
cants with blemished credit histories in the survey, 
4
one in seven had been told that they were not being 
5
hired because of their credit history. 
6
(8) While job applicants must give prior ap-
7
proval for a prospective employer to pull their credit 
8
reports under the FCRA, this authorization, as a 
9
practical matter, does not constitute an effective 
10
consumer protection because an employer may reject 
11
any job applicant who refuses a credit check. 
12
(9) Some negative information on a report may 
13
stem from uncontrollable circumstances, or signifi-
14
cant life events in a consumer’s life, such as a med-
15
ical crisis or a divorce. Demos found that poor credit 
16
is associated with household unemployment, lack of 
17
health coverage, and medical debt, which are factors 
18
that reflect economic conditions in the country and 
19
personal misfortune that have little relationship with 
20
how well a job applicant would perform at work. 
21
(10) In October 2011, FICO noted that from 
22
2008 to 2009 approximately 50 million people expe-
23
rienced a 20-point drop in their credit scores and 
24
about 21 million saw their scores decline by more

than 50 points. While the Great Recession reduced 
1
many consumers’ credit scores due to foreclosures 
2
and other financial hardships, the financial crisis 
3
had a particularly harsh impact on African Ameri-
4
cans and Latinos, as racial and ethnic minorities 
5
and communities of color were frequently targeted 
6
by predatory mortgage lenders who steered bor-
7
rowers into high-cost subprime loans, even when 
8
these borrowers would have qualified for less costly 
9
prime credit. 
10
(11) A May 2006 Brookings Institution report 
11
titled ‘‘Credit Scores, Reports, and Getting Ahead in 
12
America’’ found that counties with a relatively high-
13
er proportion of racial and ethnic minorities in the 
14
United States tended to have lower credit scores 
15
compared with counties that had a lower concentra-
16
tion of communities of color. 
17
(12) Studies have consistently found that Afri-
18
can-American and Latino households tend, on aver-
19
age, to have lower credit scores than White house-
20
holds. The growing use of credit checks, therefore, 
21
may disproportionately screen otherwise qualified ra-
22
cial and ethnic minorities out of jobs, leading to dis-
23
criminatory hiring practices, and further exacer-
24
bating the trend where unemployment for African-

American and Latino communities is elevated well 
1
above the rate of Whites. 
2
(13) A 2012 Demos survey found that 65 per-
3
cent of White respondents reported having good or 
4
excellent credit scores while over half of African- 
5
American households reported only having fair or 
6
bad credit.
