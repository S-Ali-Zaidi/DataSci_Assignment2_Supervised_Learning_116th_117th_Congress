SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
3
Congress finds that: 
4
(1) Federal regulation serves important goals 
5
and has achieved important objectives. The accumu-
6
lation of Federal regulations over the decades, how-
7
ever, is of concern. The Code of Federal Regulations 
8
currently contains over 180,000 pages of regula-
9
tions, many of which may be outdated, no longer 
10
needed, or duplicative. 
11
(2) Unneeded or inefficient regulation reduces 
12
the ability of United States employers and workers 
13
to generate and obtain more jobs and higher wages. 
14
It also increases the expenses of United States 
15
households and hinders the overall performance and 
16
competitiveness of the United States economy in the 
17
global marketplace. 
18
(3) Unneeded or inefficient regulation is par-
19
ticularly problematic as United States employers, 
20
01:17 May 28, 2021
H2212

•HR 2212 IH
workers, and households continue to respond to and 
1
seek to recover from the COVID–19 pandemic. 
2
(4) A timely and prioritized review of existing 
3
regulations to identify those that can and should be 
4
modified, consolidated, harmonized, or repealed to 
5
promote higher jobs and wages, reduce household ex-
6
penses, and improve economic performance and com-
7
petitiveness in and by the United States is needed. 
8
(5) Such a review, moreover, is needed to accel-
9
erate and strengthen the recovery of United States 
10
employers, workers, and households from the 
11
COVID–19 pandemic and ensure that Federal regu-
12
lations do not inhibit or impede preparedness for 
13
and effective responses to future pandemics. 
14
(6) The establishment of an expert commission, 
15
charged to conduct such a review and recommend to 
16
Congress legislation to effectuate a prioritized set of 
17
regulatory modifications, consolidations, harmoni-
18
zations, and repeals, can ensure that such a review 
19
will be completed in the timeliest possible way. 
20
(7) In light of the adverse impacts of and cir-
21
cumstances caused by the COVID–19 pandemic, it 
22
is particularly important that such a commission 
23
prioritize in its review the elimination of regulatory 
24
obstacles to the United States, the several States’,

COVID–19 pandemic and possible future pandemics,

(A) impeded preparedness for or response

to the COVID–19 pandemic, including those 
6
that were suspended or for which enforcement 
7
was waived after the outbreak of the pandemic 
8
under the authority of Executive Order 13924

(85 Fed. Reg. 31353; relating to regulatory re-
10
lief to support economic recovery) or any other 
11
authority; 
12
(B) could impede preparedness for or re-
13
sponse to a future pandemic; 
14
(C) otherwise impeded or could impede 
15
health, economic performance, or the stability 
16
of wages or employment during the COVID–19 
17
pandemic or a future pandemic, including those 
18
that were suspended or for which enforcement 
19
was waived after the outbreak of the pandemic 
20
under the authority of Executive Order 13924

or any other authority; and
