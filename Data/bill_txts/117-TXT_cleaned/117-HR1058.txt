RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the United States should accede to the Rome Statute 
and become a full member of the International Criminal 
Court. 
Whereas the crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, 
and war crimes are uniquely heinous and of global con-
cern; 
Whereas the United States has been a global leader in the 
field of international criminal justice for atrocity crimes 
since the Nuremberg trials; 
Whereas the fundamental principles of rule of law and ac-
countability for atrocity crimes are central to the United 
States’ values and interests at home and abroad;

•HRES 1058 IH 
Whereas the United States has demonstrated its commitment 
to these values and interests by tangibly supporting nu-
merous domestic, international, and hybrid courts for 
atrocity crimes, including the International Criminal Tri-
bunal for the Former Yugoslavia, the International 
Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, the Special Court for Si-
erra Leone, the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of 
Cambodia, the Extraordinary African Chambers, and the 
Special Tribunal for Lebanon; 
Whereas the United States further demonstrates this commit-
ment by being party to the Convention on the Prevention 
and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, the United 
Nations Convention Against Torture, and the Geneva 
Conventions; 
Whereas the United States further demonstrates this commit-
ment by the existence of dedicated offices at the Depart-
ments of Justice and Homeland Security to pursuing and 
apprehending the perpetrators of atrocity crimes, as well 
as the existence of a dedicated Office of Global Criminal 
Justice at the Department of State; 
Whereas the United States signed the Rome Statute of the 
International Criminal Court on December 31, 2000, but 
has yet to accede to the statute and join the Court as a 
full member; 
Whereas the International Criminal Court is an important in-
stitution in the global fight against impunity for war 
crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide; 
Whereas the International Criminal Court operates on the 
principle of complementarity and as a court of last resort; 
Whereas, because of these principles, the International Crimi-
nal Court does not hold jurisdiction over countries that

are willing and able to prosecute those accused of atrocity 
crimes in their domestic courts; 
Whereas, despite the United States not being a member of 
the Court, administrations of both political parties have 
recognized its utility for the national interests of the 
United States; 
Whereas only by becoming a member of the International 
Criminal Court can the United States credibly shape the 
Court’s activities and priorities; 
Whereas the vast majority of the United States’ oldest and 
closest allies are states parties to the International Crimi-
nal Court; and 
Whereas it is in line with American values, interests, and 
proud history as a global leader in the fight against im-
punity and for justice that the United States becomes a 
full member of the International Criminal Court: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-
1
resentatives that the United States should accede to the

Rome Statute and become a full member of the Inter-
