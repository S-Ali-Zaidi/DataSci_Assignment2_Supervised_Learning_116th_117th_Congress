17
Congress finds the following: 
18
(1) On January 1, 1998, nearly 25 years after 
19
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 
20
1974 was enacted and the employee stock ownership 
21
plan (hereafter in this section referred to as an 
22
‘‘ESOP’’) was created, employees were first per-
23
mitted to be owners of subchapter S corporations 
24
pursuant to the Small Business Job Protection Act 
25
of 1996 (Public Law 104–188). 
26
23:39 May 04, 2021
H2954
46 
•HR 2954 IH
(2) With the passage of the Taxpayer Relief 
1
Act of 1997 (Public Law 105–34), Congress de-
2
signed incentives to encourage businesses to become 
3
ESOP-owned S corporations. 
4
(3) Since that time, several thousand companies 
5
have become ESOP-owned S corporations, creating 
6
an ownership interest for several million Americans 
7
in companies in every State in the country, in indus-
8
tries ranging from heavy manufacturing to construc-
9
tion and contracting to services. 
10
(4) Every United States worker who is an em-
11
ployee-owner of an S corporation company through 
12
an ESOP has a valuable qualified retirement savings 
13
account. 
14
(5) Recent studies have shown that employees 
15
of ESOP-owned S corporations enjoy greater job 
16
stability, wages and benefits than employees of com-
17
parable companies; and ESOP companies are better 
18
able to weather economic downturns. 
19
(6) Studies also show that employee-owners of 
20
S corporation ESOP companies have amassed mean-
21
ingful retirement savings through their ESOP ac-
22
counts that will give them the means to retire with 
23
dignity.

foster employee ownership of S corporations through

or payments were or might be in excess of the cor-
4
rect amount, if the individual raised that question

with an authorized plan representative and was told

the payment or payments were not in excess of the
