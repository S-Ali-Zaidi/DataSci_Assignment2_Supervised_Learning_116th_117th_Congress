cause of death for American Indian and Alaska Native 
women between 25 and 34 years of age; 
Whereas in some Tribal communities, American Indian 
women face murder rates that are more than 10 times 
the national average; 
Whereas Native Hawaiians experience a disproportionately 
high rate of human trafficking with 64 percent of human 
trafficking victims in the State of Hawai’i identifying as 
at least part Native Hawaiian; 
Whereas American Indian and Alaska Native women and 
girls have a heightened risk for sex trafficking and con-
tinue to go missing and murdered across the country at 
disproportionate rates; 
Whereas American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawai-
ian victims of violence include women and girls, children, 
men, two-spirit individuals, and elders; 
Whereas the current spectrum of violence against American 
Indian and Alaska Native women is exacerbated by the 
systemic barriers embedded within the Federal Govern-
ment that have created living conditions where women 
are vulnerable to violence; 
Whereas there is little data that exists on the number of 
missing and murdered American Indian and Alaska Na-
tive women and girls in the United States due to complex 
jurisdictional issues at the Tribal, State, and Federal lev-
els; 
Whereas investigation into cases of missing and murdered 
American Indian and Alaska Native women and girls is 
made difficult for Tribal law enforcement agencies due to 
a lack of resources and the complex jurisdictional scheme 
that exists in Indian country;

•HRES 368 IH 
Whereas violence against American Indian and Alaska Native 
women and girls exists in less pressing times, and the 
COVID–19 pandemic has increased the prevalence of vio-
lence by exacerbating already existing issues including: 
lack of safe housing, lack of space in to maintain 
COVID–19 safety protocols, lack of personal protective 
equipment for staff at Tribal shelters and victim services 
programs, limited transportation to shelters, and lack of 
access to life-saving health care; 
Whereas the current funding available in Indian country is 
inadequate to address the needs of victims, from the pro-
vision of basic, emergency services and responses to more 
comprehensive, long-term services in normal times, and 
even less so during the COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas Federal agencies must implement the Not Invisible 
Act and Savanna’s Act and work with the Department of 
the Interior’s Missing & Murdered Unit to prioritize in-
vestigations of missing and murdered American Indians 
and Alaska Natives; and 
Whereas without recognition of this crisis and adequate Fed-
eral assistance and improved distribution of lifesaving re-
sources for Tribal governments, American Indian and 
Alaska Native women and girls will continue to experi-
ence disproportionate rates of violence, and go missing 
and be murdered at the highest rates in the country: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) expresses support for the designation of the

‘‘National Day of Awareness for Missing and Mur-
