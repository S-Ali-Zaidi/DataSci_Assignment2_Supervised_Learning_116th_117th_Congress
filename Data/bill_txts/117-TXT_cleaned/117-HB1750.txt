SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. 
6
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Child welfare service providers, both individ-
8
uals and organizations, have the inherent, funda-

mental, and inalienable right to free exercise of reli-
1
gion protected by the United States Constitution. 
2
(2) The right to free exercise of religion for 
3
child welfare service providers includes the freedom 
4
to refrain from conduct that conflicts with their sin-
5
cerely held religious beliefs. 
6
(3) Most States provide government-funded 
7
child welfare services through various charitable, re-
8
ligious, and private organizations. 
9
(4) Religious organizations, in particular, have 
10
a lengthy and distinguished history of providing 
11
child welfare services that predates government in-
12
volvement. 
13
(5) Religious organizations have long been and 
14
should continue contracting with and receiving 
15
grants from governmental entities to provide child 
16
welfare services. 
17
(6) Religious organizations cannot provide cer-
18
tain child welfare services, such as foster-care or 
19
adoption placements, without receiving a government 
20
contract, grant or license. 
21
(7) Religious organizations display particular 
22
excellence when providing child welfare services. 
23

•HR 1750 IH
(8) Children and families benefit greatly from 
1
the child welfare services provided by religious orga-
2
nizations. 
3
(9) Governmental entities and officials admin-
4
istering federally funded child welfare services in 
5
some States, including Massachusetts, California, Il-
6
linois, and the District of Columbia, have refused to 
7
contract with religious organizations that are unable, 
8
due to sincerely held religious beliefs or moral con-
9
victions, to provide a child welfare service that con-
10
flicts, or under circumstances that conflict, with 
11
those beliefs or convictions; and that refusal has 
12
forced many religious organizations to end their long 
13
and distinguished history of excellence in the provi-
14
sion of child welfare services. 
15
(10) Ensuring that religious organizations can 
16
continue to provide child welfare services will benefit 
17
the children and families that receive those federally 
18
funded services. 
19
(11) States also provide government-funded 
20
child welfare services through individual child wel-
21
fare service providers with varying religious and 
22
moral convictions. 
23
(12) Many individual child welfare service pro-
24
viders maintain sincerely held religious beliefs or 
25
19:36 May 03, 2021
H1750
4 
•HR 1750 IH
moral convictions that relate to their work and 
1
should not be forced to choose between their liveli-
2
hood and adherence to those beliefs or convictions. 
3
(13) Because governmental entities provide 
4
child welfare services through many charitable, reli-
5
gious, and private organizations, each with varying 
6
religious beliefs or moral convictions, and through 
7
diverse individuals with varying religious beliefs or 
8
moral convictions, the religiously impelled inability 
9
of some religious organizations or individuals to pro-
10
vide certain services will not have a material effect 
11
on a person’s ability to access federally funded child 
12
welfare services. 
13
(14) The provisions of this Act are remedial 
14
measures that are congruent and proportional to 
15
protecting the constitutional rights of child welfare 
16
service providers guaranteed under the Fourteenth 
17
Amendment to the United States Constitution. 
18
(15) Congress has the authority to pass this 
19
Act pursuant to its spending clause power and en-
20
forcement power under section 5 of the Fourteenth 
21
Amendment to the United States Constitution. 
22

23
lows:
