Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

Commission (in this Act referred to as the ‘‘Com-
1
mission’’) pursuant to section 3622(d)(3) of title 39, 
2
United States Code, resulted in the Commission’s 
3
Order Number 5763 (submitted on November 30, 
4
2020) adopting final rules for the system of regu-
5
lating rates and classes for market dominant prod-
6
ucts. 
7
(2) Such final rules rely in major part upon an 
8
earlier finding of the Commission that the then-ex-
9
isting system of market-dominant ratemaking had 
10
not enabled the United States Postal Service to 
11
achieve medium- and long-term financial stability. 
12
(3) The Commission’s findings as to medium- 
13
and long-term financial stability rested upon its cal-
14
culation of deficits (largely relating to retiree benefit 
15
obligations) accumulated on the Postal Service’s 
16
books of account. 
17
(4) Section 102(c)(1) of the USPS Fairness 
18
Act (section 102 of Public Law 117–108) canceled 
19
the unpaid Postal Service obligations under section 
20
8909a of title 5, United States Code, thereby remov-
21
ing an essential basis of such final rules. 
22
(5) Such final rules also did not adequately 
23
take into account the benefit to the Postal Service’s 
24
financial condition from the growth of its competi-
