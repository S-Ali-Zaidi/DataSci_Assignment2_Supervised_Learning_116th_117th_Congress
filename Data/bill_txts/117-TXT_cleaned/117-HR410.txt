Whereas, with the amendment, the Commonwealth became 
trustee of these resources and shall conserve and main-
tain them for the benefit of all the people;

ous organizations including the Pennsylvania Federation 
of Sportsmen’s Clubs, the Pennsylvania Bar Association,

essary as other constitutional rights in Pennsylvania;

eral Assembly and advance it on the primary ballot to 
provide Pennsylvania’s environment with permanent pro-
tection in the Commonwealth’s constitution: Now, there-
