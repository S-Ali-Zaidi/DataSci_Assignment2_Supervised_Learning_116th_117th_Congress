•HR 3587 IH
(1) the United States has a unique, legally af-
1
firmed government-to-government relationship with 
2
Tribal Governments, as set forth in the Constitution 
3
of the United States, treaties, statutes, Executive or-
4
ders, and court decisions; 
5
(2) the United States recognizes the right of 
6
Tribal Governments to self-govern and supports 
7
Tribal sovereignty and self-determination; 
8
(3) the United States, through treaties, stat-
9
utes, and historical relations, has defined a unique 
10
trust relationship and responsibility to protect and 
11
support Tribal Governments; 
12
(4) owing to this trust relationship, the United 
13
States has a responsibility to consult with Tribal 
14
Governments on a government-to-government basis 
15
when formulating policies and undertaking activities 
16
that may have impacts on Tribal lands and interests; 
17
(5) procedures for such consultation should be 
18
designed and structured to give Tribal Governments 
19
the opportunity to provide meaningful, informed 
20
input throughout the development and decision-mak-
21
ing processes; 
22
(6) increasing Federal and Tribal capacities for 
23
effective consultation while building institutional

knowledge fosters greater efficiency and will benefit 
1
future actions; 
2
(7) the consultation process should be formal-
3
ized according to best practices that are designed 
4
and administered by the agency and that fulfill the 
5
legal requirements mandated by this Act; 
6
(8) consulting with Tribal Governments during 
7
the formulation of long-term management plans re-
8
duces the likelihood of project delays and increases 
9
the efficiency of project implementations; and 
10
(9) effective consultation demands ongoing, re-
11
spectful communication between agencies and Tribal 
12
Governments. 
13
(b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this Act are— 
14
(1) to establish and support a process of reg-
15
ular, meaningful consultation and collaboration with 
16
Tribal Governments in the initiation of Federal ac-
17
tivities and the development of Federal policies and 
18
regulations that impact Tribal lands and interests; 
19
(2) to strengthen the United States govern-
20
ment-to-government relationship with Tribal Govern-
21
ments; and 
22
(3) to establish minimum standard procedures 
23
to ensure the above goals are achieved.

SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
1
It is the sense of Congress that— 
2
(1) consultation constitutes more than simply 
3
notifying an Tribal Government about a planned un-
4
dertaking; 
5
(2) effective, meaningful consultation requires a 
6
two-way exchange of information, a willingness to 
7
listen, an attempt to understand and to genuinely 
8
consider each other’s opinions, beliefs, and desired 
9
outcomes, and a seeking of agreement on how to 
10
proceed concerning the issues at hand; and 
11
(3) consultation can be considered effective and 
12
meaningful when each party demonstrates a genuine 
13
commitment to learn, acknowledge, and respect the 
14
positions, perspectives, and concerns of the other 
15
parties and when Federal agencies accommodate 
16
Tribal concerns to the extent feasible and consistent 
17
with applicable law.
