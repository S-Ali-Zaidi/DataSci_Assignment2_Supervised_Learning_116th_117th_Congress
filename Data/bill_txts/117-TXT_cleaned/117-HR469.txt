RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the designation of June 2021 as 
‘‘Migraine and Headache Awareness Month’’. 
Whereas approximately 60,000,000 Americans live with mi-
graine disease, more than have asthma or diabetes com-
bined, and 6,000,000 Americans experience chronic mi-
graine, a highly disabling neurological disorder and the 
second-leading cause of global disability; 
Whereas a migraine attack can cause severe throbbing pain 
or a pulsing sensation, usually on one side of the head, 
which is often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and ex-
treme sensitivity to light, sound, and smells; 
Whereas migraine attacks can last for hours to days, with 
pain so severe that it interferes with daily activities and 
quality of life;

Whereas the pain of cluster headache attacks is one of the 
most excruciating human experiences; 
Whereas persons living with migraine disease and headache 
disorders also experience significant stigma, often coming 
from friends, family, and coworkers; 
Whereas migraine disease and headache disorders dispropor-
tionately impact women; 
Whereas migraine disease affects approximately 45,000,000 
women in the United States, and 85 percent of those 
with chronic migraine are women; 
Whereas more than 567,000 veterans, 30 percent of whom 
are women, are diagnosed with migraine and receive their 
headache care within a Veterans Health Administration 
medical center; 
Whereas migraine disease and headache disorders are not 
only physical conditions that require living with chronic 
pain, but there is also the constant worry that these at-
tacks can strike at any moment, taking an emotional toll 
and increasing the likelihood of anxiety and depression; 
Whereas differences in diagnosis and treatment of headache 
and migraine disorders in Black, indigenous, and people 
of color communities may indicate racial and ethnic dis-
parities in access and quality of care for these patients; 
Whereas the physical pain of women is routinely dismissed by 
medical professionals and society as a whole, contributing 
to their pain and the cascading effects therefrom; 
Whereas the physical pain of Black, indigenous, and people 
of color individuals is routinely dismissed by medical pro-
fessionals and society as a whole, contributing to their 
pain and the cascading effects therefrom;

•HRES 469 IH 
Whereas studies have shown that racial bias can affect how 
doctors assess and treat pain, including a 2016 study 
that showed trainees who believed that Black people are 
not as sensitive to pain as White people were less likely 
to treat Black people’s pain appropriately; 
Whereas migraine disease is three times more common in 
women, reaching peak prevalence between 30 and 39 
years of age, at a time when many women are rapidly 
growing in their career and balancing work, family, and 
social obligations, further contributing to the wage gap; 
Whereas more than 2,300,000 women have left the United 
States workforce since the beginning of the COVID–19 
pandemic, reversing decades of labor participation rates 
and resulting in a regressive effect on gender equality; 
Whereas women account for a large majority of the estimated 
$78,000,000,000 in migraine-associated economic costs 
in the United States, representing about 80 percent of 
both direct medical costs and lost labor costs including 
presenteeism and absenteeism; 
Whereas migraine disease has significant negative con-
sequences for individuals, their families, and society as a 
whole; 
Whereas the National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded less 
than $40,000,000 in headache disorders research in fiscal 
year 2019, amounting to 0.1 percent of the total NIH 
budget, and comparisons with NIH funding of other dis-
eases of similar disability and disease burden indicate 
that funding of headache disorders research should in-
stead exceed $200,000,000 each year; 
Whereas migraine disease and cluster headache are disabling 
diseases but largely symptomatic, without reliable diag-

nostic physical signs or lab findings, meaning that Fed-
eral regulations prohibiting claimant symptoms from sup-
porting SSDI/SSI eligibility as medically determinable 
impairments in sequential evaluation unfairly prevent 
their inclusion; and 
Whereas access to relief from cluster headache is often 
inexplicably limited by lack of insurance and Medicare 
coverage of safe and effective oxygen therapy: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) expresses support for the designation of

‘‘Migraine and Headache Awareness Month’’ in 
3
order to highlight invisible diseases like migraine 
4
and headache disorders which have a dispropor-
5
tionate impact on women; 
6
(2) emphasizes the need for additional Federal 
7
support for migraine disease and headache dis-
8
orders, including increased Federal research fund-
9
ing, access to treatment options and diagnostic 
10
methods including telemedicine, and economic incen-
11
tives for additional employer accommodations; and 
12
(3) recognizes and reaffirms a commitment to 
13
public education about migraine disease and head-

ache disorders to reduce stigma.
