To require the Secretary of Energy to establish a net-nega-
tive carbon dioxide baseload power development and com-
mercialization program, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

Congress finds the following:

•HR 4891 IH
(1) Electricity, like air, food, and water, is one 
1
of life’s necessities. 
2
(2) The Department of Energy properly con-
3
cluded in its January 2017 report to Congress, titled 
4
‘‘Valuation of Energy Security for the United 
5
States’’, the following: 
6
(A) ‘‘Electricity is essential for supporting 
7
and sustaining nearly every sector of the mod-
8
ern economy ranging from industrial output 
9
and services to national security.’’. 
10
(B) ‘‘A secure, reliable electric power sec-
11
tor is necessary for economic growth, public 
12
safety, societal well-being and proper func-
13
tioning of critical infrastructure, national secu-
14
rity defense, lifeline networks, transportation 
15
communications, water and sewer.’’. 
16
(C) ‘‘Without access to reliable electricity 
17
much of the economy and all electricity-enabled 
18
critical infrastructure are at risk.’’. 
19
(3) The service and reliability of the electric 
20
grid of the United States depends significantly on 
21
baseload coal-fueled power plants. 
22
(4) Communities across the Nation are depend-
23
ent upon, for electricity supply and their economic

well-being, coal-fueled power plants and a healthy 
1
coal supply chain industry. 
2
(5) Power plants, co-fueled by coal and bio-
3
mass, that incorporate carbon capture, utilization, 
4
and storage, have net-negative carbon dioxide emis-
5
sions. 
6
(6) Baseload power plants, co-fueled by coal 
7
and biomass, that incorporate carbon capture can 
8
provide a steady supply of carbon dioxide for the 
9
manufacture of carbon-based chemicals, carbon- 
10
based building materials, and other value-added 
11
products which can use carbon dioxide. 
12
(7) The Federal Government is likely to adopt 
13
climate change policies that abruptly drive reduction 
14
in greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, the Fed-
15
eral Government should also incentivize the commer-
16
cialization of net-negative carbon dioxide power 
17
plant technology to achieve emissions reduction tar-
18
gets, improve the reliability of the United States 
19
electricity grid, and protect coal communities from 
20
devastating economic loss. 
21
(8) The United States should lead the world in 
22
developing 21st century net-negative baseload power 
23
technologies that will allow developing countries to

continue to use their domestic energy resources,
