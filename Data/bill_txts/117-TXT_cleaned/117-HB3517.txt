Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Increasing Access to 
2
Osteoporosis Testing for Medicare Beneficiaries Act of 
3
2021’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
5
The Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) The total annual expense of providing care 
7
for osteoporotic fractures among Medicare bene-
8
ficiaries, including direct medical costs as well as in-
9
direct societal costs related to productivity losses 
10
and informal caregiving, has been estimated at $57 
11
billion in 2018, with an expected increase to over 
12
$95 billion in 2040. 
13
(2) Osteoporosis is a silent disease that often is 
14
not discovered until a fracture occurs. One out of 
15
two women and up to one of four men will suffer an 
16
osteoporotic fracture in their lifetimes. 
17
(3) Osteoporosis disproportionately impacts 
18
women, who account for 71 percent of osteoporotic 
19
fractures, and 75 percent of costs. 
20
(4) Most women are not aware of their personal 
21
risk factors for osteoporosis, the prevalence of, or 
22
the morbidity and mortality associated with the dis-
23
ease, despite the fact that broken bones due to 
24
osteoporosis lead to more hospitalizations and great-

er health care costs than heart attack, stroke, or 
1
breast cancer in women age 55 and above. 
2
(5) A woman’s risk of hip fracture is equal to 
3
her combined risk of breast, uterine, and ovarian 
4
cancer. More women die in the United States in the 
5
year following a hip fracture than from breast can-
6
cer. 
7
(6) One out of four people who have an 
8
osteoporotic hip fracture will need long-term nursing 
9
home care. Half of those who experience osteoporotic 
10
hip fractures are unable to walk without assistance. 
11
(7) Nearly one in five Medicare patients die 
12
within one year of a new osteoporotic fracture. 
13
Beneficiaries with a hip fracture had the highest 
14
mortality where approximately 30 percent died with-
15
in 12 months of the fracture. 
16
(8) Bone density testing is more powerful in 
17
predicting fractures than cholesterol is in predicting 
18
myocardial infarction or blood pressure in predicting 
19
stroke. 
20
(9) Since 2007, Medicare has cut DXA reim-
21
bursement by over 72 percent. By 2019, the pay-
22
ment cuts caused a loss of 44 percent of DXA office 
23
providers resulting in declines in expected DXA test-

ing, leaving 1.65 million women undiagnosed and 
1
untreated for osteoporosis. 
2
(10) A decade of steady decline in hip fractures 
3
stopped abruptly in 2013. As of 2019, there have 
4
been more than 71,775 additional hip fractures, 
5
costing almost $3 billion, leading to almost 16,000 
6
additional deaths than expected if the decline had 
7
continued. 
8
(11) An estimated 205,000 Medicare Fee For 
9
Service beneficiaries, or about 15 percent of those 
10
who had a new osteoporotic fracture, suffered one or 
11
more subsequent fractures within 12 months of the 
12
initial fracture.

14
TION AND TREATMENT.

Section 1848(b) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.
