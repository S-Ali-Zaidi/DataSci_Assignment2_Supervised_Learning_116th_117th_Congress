A BILL 
To direct the Secretary of Labor to establish a renewable 
energy transition grant program and to establish a Na-
tional Employment Corps, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Protecting Workers 
4
for a Clean Future Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) The fossil fuel and fossil fuel-dependent in-
8
dustries have been major drivers of employment and

economic growth in regions throughout California. 
1
Yet, despite the success of these industries, many 
2
local residents are unemployed or live in poverty. In 
3
addition, nearby communities often suffer from pol-
4
lution, poor air and water quality, and other health 
5
hazards. The goal of community transition grants is 
6
to develop a vision for a future economy based on 
7
equity, sustainability, and shared prosperity. A re-
8
gional approach requires bringing together a diverse 
9
set of stakeholders that represent the whole commu-
10
nity. This coalition must be capable of developing 
11
and implementing strategies to support workers and 
12
communities that will be affected by the transition 
13
away from fossil fuels. To be effective, coalitions 
14
should work closely with high road employers and in-
15
dustry leaders to identify in-demand skills and work-
16
force strategies that promote emerging and expand-
17
ing sectors of the regional economy. 
18
(2) These strategies should provide pathways 
19
for impacted workers to transition to other sustain-
20
able jobs and careers. They should also include the 
21
frontline communities who have historically been ex-
22
cluded from the economic benefits of the fossil fuel 
23
industry, while bearing the greatest costs of pollu-
24
tion and ecological damage.

(3) Partnerships should include organizations 
1
representing workers and communities impacted by 
2
the fossil fuel industry and the transition to a car-
3
bon-constrained economy. Workers, residents, and 
4
community leaders have inherent knowledge of re-
5
gional dynamics, issues, and needs, and should func-
6
tion at the center of developing regional solutions. 
7
(4) In addition, coalitions should be diverse and 
8
represent a wide range of regional interests and 
9
stakeholders, including organizations representing 
10
labor, environmental justice, industry, economic de-
11
velopment, local tribal and municipal government, 
12
and educational institutions. 
13
(5) As the United States and global economies 
14
shift from fossil fuels to more sustainable sources of 
15
energy, the fossil fuel workforce cannot be left be-
16
hind. They must be part of the conversation and 
17
have a role in shaping the transition.
