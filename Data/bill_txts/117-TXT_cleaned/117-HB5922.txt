Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Sarah Keys Evans

Congressional Gold Medal Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 5922 IH
(1) Sarah Keys Evans was born on April 18, 
1
1929, in Washington, North Carolina, in a town 
2
called Keysville, the second oldest of seven children. 
3
(2) Sarah Keys, an Army veteran and civil 
4
rights pioneer, is a living example that change is 
5
possible if we are willing to stand up and fight for 
6
what is right. 
7
(3) Before the 1955 arrest of Rosa Parks and 
8
the Montgomery bus boycott that followed, there was 
9
Sarah Keys Evans. Her refusal to give up her seat 
10
on an interstate charter bus prompted the landmark 
11
court case, Sarah Keys v. Carolina Coach Company, 
12
in which the Interstate Commerce Commission 
13
(ICC) outlawed the segregation of Black passengers 
14
in buses traveling across State lines. 
15
(4) On August 1, 1952, Women’s Army Corps, 
16
Private First Class Sarah Keys, boarded a bus in 
17
Trenton, New Jersey, for her first home visit to 
18
Washington, North Carolina, since joining the mili-
19
tary. The bus she boarded would take her directly to 
20
her North Carolina destination without any required 
21
bus changes. 
22
(5) Once the bus reached Roanoke Rapids, 
23
North Carolina, a new driver took over the bus and 
24
as was custom, went through the bus and rechecked

tickets. When he came to Ms. Keys, he told her to 
1
give up her seat to a White Marine who boarded the 
2
bus in Roanoke Rapids and move to the back of the 
3
bus. Tired from her long journey and understanding 
4
her rights, Sarah refused. 
5
(6) Six years prior, in 1946, there was a Su-
6
preme Court decision (Morgan v. Virginia) that said 
7
it was illegal to practice passenger segregation on 
8
interstate buses, but local jurisdictions found ways 
9
to circumvent Federal laws. 
10
(7) Frustrated with her persistence, the bus 
11
driver announced that all passengers would be mov-
12
ing to a different bus, but ‘‘that woman’’ who re-
13
fused to change her seat, referring to Ms. Keys, 
14
would not be allowed to board the new bus and 
15
would not be allowed to continue the trip. 
16
(8) Shortly thereafter, two police officers ar-
17
rived at the bus terminal, took Sarah by the arms 
18
into a patrol car and drove her to the Roanoke Rap-
19
ids police station. Because she refused to be sub-
20
jected to unjust discrimination and prejudice, she 
21
was forced to stay in jail overnight and was fined 
22
$25.00 (would be $240.00 today) before her release.

(9) Once Sarah arrived home and informed her 
1
family of the injustice she endured, her father en-
2
couraged her to seek legal action. 
3
(10) The National Association for the Advance-
4
ment of Colored People (NAACP) referred the fam-
5
ily to attorney Dovey Johnson Roundtree, a Captain 
6
in the Women’s Army Corps, who brought her case 
7
before the ICC. The ICC meeting in the District of 
8
Columbia took place on May 12, 1954. It was de-
9
cided by only one member of the ICC. 
10
(11) New York Congressman Adam Clayton 
11
Powell, Jr., agreed it was not fair that the other 10 
12
members of the ICC were not involved in the deci-
13
sion. Congressman Powell helped persuade the ICC 
14
to reconsider its decision. 
15
(12) After the Supreme Court decision on 
16
Brown v. Board of Education on May 17, 1954, and 
17
with the support of Department of Justice Attorney 
18
General Herbert Brownell, the ICC reached a new 
19
decision. A majority of the ICC members had de-
20
cided that it was wrong for people on State-to-State 
21
trips to be forced to sit in certain seats on a bus be-
22
cause of the color of their skin and that it was 
23
against the law.

(13) The ICC decision on November 25, 1955, 
1
went further than the Supreme Court’s ruling in 
2
1946 which had outlawed only unfair laws that a 
3
State might make, not rules that a bus company 
4
might make. 
5
(14) In Sarah Keys v. Carolina Coach Com-
6
pany, the ICC ruled in favor of Keys Evans. In their 
7
decision, the Commission found the Interstate Com-
8
merce Act forbids segregation as the practice sub-
9
jects passengers to ‘‘unjust discrimination, and 
10
undue and unreasonable prejudice and disadvantage, 
11
in violation of section 216(d) of the Interstate Com-
12
merce Act and is therefore unlawful’’.
