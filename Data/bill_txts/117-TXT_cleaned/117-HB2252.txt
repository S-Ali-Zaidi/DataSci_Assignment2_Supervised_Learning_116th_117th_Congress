•HR 2252 IH
(1) The brutal lynching of Emmett Till and the 
1
subsequent bravery and boldness of his mother, 
2
Mamie Till-Mobley, became a catalyst for the civil 
3
rights movement. 
4
(2) On August 28, 1955, 14-year-old Emmett 
5
Till was kidnapped, beaten, and shot in Money, Mis-
6
sissippi, where he had traveled from Chicago to stay 
7
with his great uncle, Moses Wright. 
8
(3) The corpse of Emmett Till was discovered 
9
3 days later in the Tallahatchie River and his mur-
10
derers were acquitted despite Moses Wright pro-
11
viding an eyewitness testimony that the men on trial 
12
kidnapped Emmett Till. 
13
(4) Mamie Till-Mobley, the mother of Emmett 
14
Till, demonstrated her love for her son and her cour-
15
age and strength in suffering in the days that fol-
16
lowed as she brought the body of Emmett Till back 
17
to Chicago for burial and demanded an open casket 
18
funeral, which drew more than 50,000 attendees. 
19
(5) Mamie Till-Mobley further allowed a photo-
20
graph to be taken of Emmett Till in his casket, 
21
which was shown throughout the world. 
22
(6) The original casket of Emmett Till stands 
23
on display at the National Museum of African Amer-
24
ican History and Culture as an enduring reminder

•HR 2252 IH
of the racial violence that is a part of the history of 
1
the United States that the people of the United 
2
States must confront. 
3
(7) The heroic actions of Mamie Till-Mobley in 
4
the midst of evil, injustice, and grief became a cata-
5
lyst for the civil rights movement and continued in 
6
the years to come as she worked for justice and hon-
7
ored the legacy of Emmett Till. 
8
(8) Mamie Till-Mobley went on to create the 
9
Emmett Till Players, which was a significant na-
10
tional cultural contribution as teenagers traveled 
11
throughout the country presenting Martin Luther 
12
King, Jr., speeches in the name of Emmett Till. 
13
(9) Mamie Till-Mobley also served as chair and 
14
co-founder of the Emmett Till Justice Campaign, 
15
which had the dual mission of reopening the murder 
16
of Emmett Till for a reinvestigation and a passage 
17
into law of Federal legislation to ensure that other 
18
racially motivated murders during the civil rights era 
19
were investigated and, when possible, prosecuted. 
20
(10) The efforts of the Emmett Till Justice 
21
Campaign led to the successful joint investigation by 
22
the State of Mississippi, the Federal Bureau of In-
23
vestigation, and the Department of Justice in 2004,

of Mamie Till-Mobley that led to the civil rights
