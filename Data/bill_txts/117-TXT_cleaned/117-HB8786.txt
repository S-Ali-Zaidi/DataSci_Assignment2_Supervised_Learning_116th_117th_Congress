Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘National Land Bank 
4
Network Act of 2022’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Vacant and abandoned properties desta-
8
bilize rural, suburban, and urban neighborhoods 
9
across the United States by creating fire and other

public safety hazards, driving down property values, 
1
and draining local tax dollars. 
2
(2) The cost of repairs to maintain vacant and 
3
abandoned properties, as well as the potential un-
4
paid taxes and public liens on vacant and abandoned 
5
properties, often exceed the property values of va-
6
cant and abandoned properties, driving away pur-
7
chasers. 
8
(3) The lack of an insurable and marketable 
9
title frequently prevents vacant and abandoned prop-
10
erties from returning to productive use. 
11
(4) Low-income neighborhoods and commu-
12
nities of color disproportionately bear the burden of 
13
living near vacant and abandoned properties and the 
14
hazards associated with those properties. 
15
(5) Existing property disposition practices fre-
16
quently prioritize the ease of disposition and maxi-
17
mizing sale prices instead of the needs of commu-
18
nities and homeowners. 
19
(6) Land banks— 
20
(A) have been developed to respond to the 
21
challenges posed by vacant and abandoned 
22
properties; and 
23
(B) are primarily focused on the return of 
24
vacant, abandoned, and tax delinquent prop-

erties to productive use in accordance with lo-
1
cally determined goals and priorities. 
2
(7) Land banks, regardless of the location, size 
3
of inventory, or duration of existence of a particular 
4
land bank, share challenges in accessing best prac-
5
tices, research, technical assistance, and other re-
6
sources. 
7
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
8
It is the sense of Congress that a national land bank 
9
network would provide the tools necessary to ensure that 
10
land banks— 
11
(1) use best practices; 
12
(2) operate transparently; 
13
(3) prioritize positive community outcomes; 
14
(4) develop partnerships and programming to 
15
drive community redevelopment forward; and 
16
(5) access education, expertise, and research to 
17
strengthen the critical work of land banks in sup-
18
porting equitable communities.
