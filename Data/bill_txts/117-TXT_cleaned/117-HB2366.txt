SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
3
Congress finds the following: 
4
(1) The opioid epidemic has led to a rise in 
5
overdose deaths across the Nation. 
6
(2) In 2017, the number of overdose deaths in-
7
volving opioids, including fentanyl, was six times 
8
higher than in 1999. 
9
(3) The age-adjusted rate of drug overdose 
10
deaths involving synthetic opioids other than metha-
11
done increased by 10 percent from 2017 to 2018. 
12
(4) The COVID–19 pandemic has been associ-
13
ated with substance use. According to the Centers 
14
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 13 per-
15
cent of surveyed adults had started or increased sub-
16
stance use to cope with stress or emotions related to 
17
COVID–19. 
18
(5) Federal agencies, along with Federal, State, 
19
and local lawmakers, have worked together to re-
20
spond to the rise in overdose deaths through in-
21
creased funding and targeted policy initiatives. 
22
(6) This includes the successful passage of the 
23
Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016 
24
(CARA), the 21st Century Cures Act, and the Sub-
25

stance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes 
1
Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and 
2
Communities Act (SUPPORT for Patient and Com-
3
munities Act). 
4
(7) These efforts have helped prevent, treat, 
5
and combat the opioid epidemic, but the rise in over-
6
dose deaths involving synthetic opioids like fentanyl 
7
means that not all communities are seeing a reduc-
8
tion in fatalities. 
9
(8) Drug overdose deaths in the United States 
10
involving fentanyl have risen from 2011 through 
11
2016, growing from 1,600 fentanyl overdose related 
12
deaths in 2011 and 2012 to 18,000 deaths in 2016. 
13
(9) This rise in fentanyl overdose related deaths 
14
has disproportionately impacted communities of 
15
color. 
16
(10) According to the Centers for Disease Con-
17
trol and Prevention (CDC), drug overdose death 
18
rates involving fentanyl for non-Hispanic African 
19
Americans had the largest annual percentage in-
20
crease from 2011 to 2016 at 140.6 percent per year, 
21
followed by Hispanic persons at 118.3 percent per 
22
year. Fentanyl-involved overdose rates for non-His-
23
panic White persons increased by 108.8 percent 
24
from 2013 to 2016. 
25
18:34 Jun 05, 2021
H2366
5 
•HR 2366 IH
(11) According to the CDC, rates of drug over-
1
dose deaths involving fentanyl increased exponen-
2
tially from 2011 through 2016 for most regions of 
3
the United States. 
4
(12) Fentanyl is increasingly being identified in 
5
nonopioid substances, like methamphetamine and co-
6
caine. 
7
(13) By 2017, over half of heroin and cocaine 
8
overdose death records involved synthetic opioids. 
9
(14) Previous policies to counter the widespread 
10
use of illicit substances through tougher sentencing 
11
guidelines disproportionately impact communities of 
12
color. 
13
(15) There is a growing need for a comprehen-
14
sive plan focused on monitoring, researching, treat-
15
ing, and preventing fentanyl overdose deaths. 
16
(16) Taking a public health approach to revers-
17
ing overdose death trends and promoting equity 
18
should emphasize increasing research and expanding 
19
access to treatment.
