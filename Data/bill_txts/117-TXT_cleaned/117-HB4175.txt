(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
6
gress that— 
7
(1) it is in the United States national interest

10
and preserve peace and security; 
11
(2) the United States fully stands behind com-
12
mitments to its allies in Northeast Asia as articu-
13
lated in the Mutual Defense Treaty Between the 
14
United States and the Republic of Korea and the 
15
Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between 
16
the United States and Japan; 
17
(3) the alliances between the United States and 
18
the Republic of Korea and between the United 
19
States and Japan form the bedrock of regional sta-
20
bility in the Indo-Pacific region, including with re-
21
spect to the threat posed by North Korea; 
22
(4) the withdrawal or significant reduction of 
23

the appropriate congressional committees a report

13
serving deterrence on the Korean Peninsula; 
14
(B) the anticipated reaction of North

certifies to the appropriate congressional committees

States allies in the region;

13
sulted with allies of the United States, includ-

ing the Republic of Korea and Japan, regarding
