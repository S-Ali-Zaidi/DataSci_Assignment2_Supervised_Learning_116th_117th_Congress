RESOLUTION 
Expunging the January 13, 2021, impeachment of President 
Donald John Trump. 
Whereas the Constitution provides that the House of Rep-
resentatives ‘‘shall have the sole Power of Impeachment’’ 
and that the President ‘‘shall be removed from Office on 
Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or 
other high Crimes and Misdemeanors’’; 
Whereas, on January 13, 2021, the House of Representatives 
passed H. Res. 24, Agreeing to Article I of the Resolu-
tion Impeaching Donald John Trump, President of the

United States, for high Crimes and Misdemeanors, by a 
vote of 232 Yeas, 197 Nays, and 4 Not Voting; 
Whereas Article I of the Resolution, entitled ‘‘Incitement of 
Insurrection’’, contains a subjective account of that which 
transpired at the Capitol on January 6, 2021; 
Whereas Article I of the Resolution omits any discussion of 
the circumstances, unusual voting patterns, and voting 
anomalies of the 2020 Presidential election itself; 
Whereas prior to considering and voting on the Impeachment 
Resolution, Democratic leadership in the House made no 
effort to understand the rationale behind the widespread 
mistrust harbored by American voters in the wake of the 
2020 Presidential election; 
Whereas President Trump won 18 of the 19 bellwether coun-
ties across the country that have predicted the winner of 
every Presidential election since 1980; 
Whereas President Trump received approximately 10,100,000 
more votes than in the 2016 Presidential election, mak-
ing President Trump the first incumbent President in 
132 years, since Grover Cleveland’s failed bid for reelec-
tion in 1888, to have increased his vote from his initial 
election and seemingly still not won reelection in the sub-
sequent cycle; 
Whereas Secretaries of State and State boards of election 
across the country changed State election laws sua sponte 
in the name of ‘‘health and safety’’ in the wake of the 
COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas public officials in numerous States issued guidance 
to counties that local election officials were precluded 
from performing on-the-spot signature analysis, ensuring 
absentee ballots could not be rejected because an election

official believed the voter’s signature on a ballot envelope 
did not match the signature on file; 
Whereas four Democratic lawmakers (Senators Warren, Klo-
buchar, Wyden, and Representative Pocan), formerly en-
thusiastic proponents of voting machine integrity, went so 
far as to send a 2019 letter to voting system companies, 
providing real examples of voting machine problems (such 
as switching votes, rejecting paper ballots, vulnerability 
to cyberattack) yet, following the 2020 Presidential elec-
tion, any individual who raised the same concerns was 
dismissed by Democrats and pundits in the mainstream 
media as spreading ‘‘misinformation’’ and as being noth-
ing more than a ‘‘conspiracy theorist’’; 
Whereas recount efforts following the 2020 Presidential elec-
tion were vociferously opposed by Governors and Secre-
taries of State in key swing States like Arizona, Pennsyl-
vania, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Georgia; 
Whereas public officials in key swing States ignored, and 
took great steps to resist, calls for accountability and 
transparency in election administration and the counting 
and recounting of ballots in their respective States, fur-
ther sowing the seed of doubt in the electorate as to the 
legitimacy and fairness in the final result; 
Whereas rather than setting forth facts and evidence sup-
porting the need to impeach a President a matter of days 
before he leaves office, Article I of the Resolution cites 
two quotes from President Trump’s January 6, 2021, 
speech on the Ellipse that lack any context, and are 
viewed in a light most unfavorable to the President; 
Whereas Article I of the Resolution grasps at the fact that 
President Trump stated ‘‘we won this election, and we

•HRES 1131 IH 
won it by a landslide’’, as well as ‘‘if you don’t fight like 
hell you’re not going to have a country anymore’’, as un-
deniable evidence that ‘‘high Crimes and Misdemeanors’’ 
were committed, and that President Trump engaged in 
‘‘insurrection or rebellion against the United States’’; 
Whereas Article I of the Resolution conveniently fails to men-
tion the fact that President Trump explicitly stated, ‘‘I 
know that everyone here will soon be marching over to 
the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make 
your voices heard’’; 
Whereas the consideration of the Resolution by the House of 
Representatives failed to follow any meaningful legislative 
process whatsoever; 
Whereas not a single evidentiary hearing on the Resolution 
was held, no witnesses were heard, and no process or op-
portunity to respond was provided to President Trump; 
Whereas no Members of Congress were provided an oppor-
tunity to review or amend the Resolution before it came 
before the full House of Representatives for consider-
ation; 
Whereas the Committee on Rules of the House of Represent-
atives is the only committee that published an official 
Committee Report for the Resolution, that being the Re-
port accompanying H. Res. 41, the rule providing for 
floor consideration of the Resolution; 
Whereas while a ‘‘Majority Staff Report’’ was released by 
Democrats on the House Committee on the Judiciary, the 
Committee did not issue an official Committee Report, 
via regular order, for H. Res. 24, the Resolution itself; 
Whereas failing to issue a Committee Report for H. Res. 24 
conveniently precluded House Judiciary Committee Re-

•HRES 1131 IH 
publicans a forum in which they may have showcased 
their dissenting views on the Resolution; 
Whereas to assert that a lone Committee Report accom-
panying a procedural rule for floor consideration provided 
sufficient due process to the Trump administration or the 
American people via their elected representatives, and to 
assert that voting Yea on the Resolution was justified, 
runs contrary to the Oath of Office taken by all Members 
of the House of Representatives; 
Whereas neither the Committee Report issued by the Com-
mittee on Rules of the House of Representatives, nor the 
text of the Impeachment Resolution itself, contain any 
mention of the text of section 3 of article I of the Con-
stitution, which provides that ‘‘Judgment in Cases of Im-
peachment shall not extend further than to removal from 
Office’’; 
Whereas a plain reading of the text of section 3 of article I 
of the Constitution demonstrates that an official tried, 
and convicted, in the Senate must first occupy the ‘‘Of-
fice’’ from which he is to be removed, let alone forever 
be disqualified from ‘‘hold[ing] any office . . . under the 
United States’’; 
Whereas in frantically passing the Impeachment Resolution 
on January 13, 2021, only 2 days after it was introduced 
in a frenzy of hysteria, House Democrats, and 10 House 
Republicans, left the Senate only one week to conduct a 
complete trial and convict President Trump before he left 
office; 
Whereas doing so left the Senate virtually no chance to com-
port with section 3 of article I of the Constitution; 
02:53 May 19, 2022

•HRES 1131 IH 
Whereas unsurprisingly, 31 days passed before the Senate 
held a vote and failed to convict President Trump, 23 
days after he had left office; and 
Whereas as further indication of the partisan political motiva-
tions behind the Resolution, once the Article of Impeach-
ment was passed by the House of Representatives and 
transmitted to the Senate, the Chief Justice of the Su-
preme Court refused to serve as the presiding officer for 
the trial, as required by section 3 of article I of the Con-
stitution, and instead the Senate President pro tempore, 
Senator Pat Leahy, a Democrat from Vermont, and a re-
liably partisan politician, served as the presiding officer, 
perfecting the entirety of the process as nothing more 
than an unconstitutional exercise in futility, moot, and 
fantastical political theater: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the January 13, 2021, impeachment 
1
of President Donald John Trump is expunged, as if such 
2
Article had never passed the full House of Representa-
3
tives, as the facts and circumstances upon which such Ar-
4
ticle was based met the burden of proving neither that 
5
President Trump committed ‘‘high Crimes and Mis-
6
demeanors’’, as set forth in section 4 of article II of the 
7
Constitution, nor that President Trump engaged in ‘‘in-
8
surrection or rebellion against the United States’’, such 
9
that he is forever precluded from ‘‘hold[ing] any office 
10
. . . under the United States’’ pursuant to section 3 of 
11
the 14th Amendment to the Constitution.
