Whereas tens of thousands of elementary and middle school 
students have participated in No Name-Calling Week

analyzing the pervasive harassment and victimization 
faced by elementary students and lesbian, gay, bisexual,

Whereas 26 percent of elementary students reported hearing 
others say hurtful things based on another student’s race 
or ethnic background;

Whereas 44 percent of LGBTQ+ middle and high school stu-
dents frequently or often hear negative remarks about
