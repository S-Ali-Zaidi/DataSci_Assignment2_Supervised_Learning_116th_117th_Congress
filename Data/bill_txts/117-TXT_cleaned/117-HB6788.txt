SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
The Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The 761st Tank Battalion, known as the 
3
‘‘Black Panthers’’, was activated on April 1, 1942, 
4
and served as the first predominantly Black Amer-
5
ican armored battalion in the European Theater of 
6
World War II until its deactivation on June 1, 1946, 
7
in Germany. 
8
(2) Lieutenant Jackie Robinson, the first Black 
9
Major League baseball player, was among the few 
10
Black officers in the 761st, but he was court 
11
martialed before seeing combat for an act of civil 
12
disobedience in refusing to move to the back of a 
13
bus. 
14
(3) Despite resistance from many top-level 
15
American politicians and military officers, the 761st 
16
served valiantly under Lieutenant General George S. 
17
Patton. 
18
(4) In his welcoming speech, Patton said, ‘‘I 
19
would never have asked for you if you weren’t good. 
20
I have nothing but the best in my Army. I don’t care 
21
what color you are as long as you go up there and 
22
kill those. . .’’. 
23
(5) After entering combat in late fall 1944, the 
24
761st lived up to their motto, ‘‘Come Out Fighting’’, 
25
05:33 Mar 01, 2022

•HR 6788 IH
enduring 183 days of combat without being pulled 
1
from the line. 
2
(6) The 761st played a crucial role in numerous 
3
battles including the Battle of the Bulge and helped 
4
break out the encircled American paratroopers in the 
5
town of Bastogne. 
6
(7) During their time in combat, the 761st in-
7
flicted 130,000 casualties on the Germans while en-
8
during a casualty rate of almost 50 percent with the 
9
loss of 71 tanks. 
10
(8) As the spearhead for several of Patton’s 
11
moves toward Germany, they were the first Amer-
12
ican unit to break through the Siegfried Line and 
13
they were one of the first American units to link up 
14
with the Russian Army at the Enns River at Steyr, 
15
Austria. 
16
(9) Sadly, like other Black soldiers in World 
17
War II, members of the 761st did not receive the 
18
recognition that was due them upon returning home, 
19
and instead faced prejudice at home after the war. 
20
(10) The accomplishments of the 761st were 
21
largely unrecognized until 1978 when, over three 
22
decades after the war, the battalion finally received 
23
a Presidential Unit Citation. 
24

(11) The citation acknowledges ‘‘the extraor-
1
dinary gallantry, courage, professionalism, and high 
2
esprit de corps displayed in the accomplishment of 
3
unusually difficult and hazardous operations in the 
4
European Theater of Operations’’. 
5
(12) In addition to that citation, individual 
6
members of the 761st had earned the following: 1 
7
Medal of Honor, 11 Silver Stars, and approximately 
8
300 Purple Hearts. 
9
(13) The United States is eternally grateful to 
10
the soldiers of the 761st Tank Battalion for their 
11
crucial role in the success of Allied forces in Europe 
12
and for helping ensure freedom around the globe.
