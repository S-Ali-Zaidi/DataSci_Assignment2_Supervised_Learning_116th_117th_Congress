(a) FINDINGS.— 
4
(1) EFFECT
ON
HEALTH
CARE
ACCESS
AND 
5
COSTS.—Congress finds that the current civil justice 
6
system is adversely affecting patient access to health 
7
care services, better patient care, and cost-efficient 
8
health care, in that the health care liability system 
9
without reform is a costly and inefficient mechanism 
10
for resolving claims of health care liability and com-
11
pensating injured patients, and is a deterrent to the 
12
sharing of information among health care profes-
13
sionals which impedes efforts to improve patient 
14
safety and quality of care.

(2) EFFECT ON FEDERAL SPENDING.—

•HR 9584 IH
(A) Congress finds that the health care li-
1
ability litigation systems existing throughout 
2
the United States have a significant effect on 
3
the amount, distribution, and use of Federal 
4
funds because of— 
5
(i) the large number of individuals 
6
who receive health care benefits under pro-
7
grams operated or financed by the Federal 
8
Government; 
9
(ii) the large number of individuals 
10
who benefit because of the exclusion from 
11
Federal taxes of the amounts spent to pro-
12
vide them with health insurance benefits; 
13
and 
14
(iii) the large number of health care 
15
providers who provide items or services for 
16
which the Federal Government makes pay-
17
ments. 
18
(B) Congress finds that the Federal deficit 
19
would be reduced by $28,000,000,000 over the 
20
next decade if Federal health care liability re-
21
forms were enacted, as verified by the Congres-
22
sional Budget Office. 
23
(3) EFFECT
ON
INTERSTATE
COMMERCE.— 
24
Congress finds that the health care and insurance 
25
05:11 Dec 28, 2022
H9584
4 
•HR 9584 IH
industries are industries affecting interstate com-
1
merce and the health care liability litigation systems 
2
existing throughout the United States are activities 
3
that affect interstate commerce by contributing to 
4
the high costs of health care and premiums for 
5
health care liability insurance purchased by health 
6
care system providers. 
7
(b) PURPOSE.—It is the purpose of this Act to imple-
8
ment reasonable, comprehensive, and effective health care 
9
liability reforms designed to— 
10
(1) improve the availability of health care serv-
11
ices in cases in which health care liability actions 
12
have been shown to be a factor in the decreased 
13
availability of services; 
14
(2) reduce the incidence of ‘‘defensive medi-
15
cine’’ and lower the cost of health care liability in-
16
surance, all of which contribute to the escalation of 
17
health care costs; 
18
(3) ensure that persons with meritorious health 
19
care injury claims receive fair and adequate com-
20
pensation, including reasonable noneconomic dam-
21
ages; 
22
(4) improve the fairness and cost-effectiveness 
23
of our current health care liability system to resolve 
24
disputes over, and provide compensation for, health 
25

care liability by reducing uncertainty in the amount 
1
of compensation provided to injured individuals; and 
2
(5) provide an increased sharing of information 
3
in the health care system which will reduce unin-
4
tended injury and improve patient care.

SEC. 3. ENCOURAGING SPEEDY RESOLUTION OF CLAIMS. 
6
(a) STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.—The time for the 
7
commencement of a health care lawsuit shall be 3 years 
8
after the date of injury or 1 year after the claimant dis-
9
covers, or through the use of reasonable diligence should 
10
have discovered, the injury, whichever occurs first. In no 
11
event shall the time for commencement of a health care 
12
lawsuit exceed 3 years after the date of injury unless tolled 
13
for any of the following— 
14
(1) upon proof of fraud; 
15
(2) intentional concealment; or 
16
(3) the presence of a foreign body, which has no 
17
therapeutic or diagnostic purpose or effect, in the 
18
person of the injured person. 
19
Actions by a minor shall be commenced within 3 years 
20
from the date of the injury except that actions by a minor 
21
under the full age of 6 years shall be commenced within 
22
3 years of injury, or 1 year after the injury is discovered, 
23
or through the use of reasonable diligence should have 
24
been discovered, or prior to the minor’s 8th birthday, 
25
05:11 Dec 28, 2022
H9584
6 
•HR 9584 IH
whichever provides a longer period. Such time limitation 
1
shall be tolled for minors for any period during which a 
2
parent or guardian and a health care provider have com-
3
mitted fraud or collusion in the failure to bring an action 
4
on behalf of the injured minor. 
5
(b) STATE FLEXIBILITY.—No provision of subsection 
6
(a) shall be construed to preempt any State law (whether 
7
effective before, on, or after the date of the enactment of 
8
this Act) that— 
9
(1) specifies a time period of less than 3 years 
10
after the date of injury or less than 1 year after the 
11
claimant discovers, or through the use of reasonable 
12
diligence should have discovered, the injury, for the 
13
filing of a health care lawsuit; 
14
(2) that specifies a different time period for the 
15
filing of lawsuits by a minor; 
16
(3) that triggers the time period based on the 
17
date of the alleged negligence; or 
18
(4) establishes a statute of repose for the filing 
19
of health care lawsuit. 
20
SEC. 4. COMPENSATING PATIENT INJURY. 
21
(a) UNLIMITED AMOUNT OF DAMAGES FOR ACTUAL 
22
ECONOMIC LOSSES IN HEALTH CARE LAWSUITS.—In any 
23
health care lawsuit, nothing in this Act shall limit a claim-
24
05:11 Dec 28, 2022
H9584
7 
•HR 9584 IH
ant’s recovery of the full amount of the available economic 
1
damages, notwithstanding the limitation in subsection (b). 
2
(b) ADDITIONAL NONECONOMIC DAMAGES.—In any 
3
health care lawsuit, the amount of noneconomic damages, 
4
if available, shall not exceed $250,000, regardless of the 
5
number of parties against whom the action is brought or 
6
the number of separate claims or actions brought with re-
7
spect to the same injury. 
8
(c) NO DISCOUNT OF AWARD FOR NONECONOMIC 
9
DAMAGES.—For purposes of applying the limitation in 
10
subsection (b), future noneconomic damages shall not be 
11
discounted to present value. The jury shall not be in-
12
formed about the maximum award for noneconomic dam-
13
ages. An award for noneconomic damages in excess of 
14
$250,000 shall be reduced either before the entry of judg-
15
ment, or by amendment of the judgment after entry of 
16
judgment, and such reduction shall be made before ac-
17
counting for any other reduction in damages required by 
18
law. If separate awards are rendered for past and future 
19
noneconomic damages and the combined awards exceed 
20
$250,000, the future noneconomic damages shall be re-
21
duced first. 
22
(d) FAIR SHARE RULE.—In any health care lawsuit, 
23
each party shall be liable for that party’s several share 
24
of any damages only and not for the share of any other 
25
05:11 Dec 28, 2022
H9584
8 
•HR 9584 IH
person. Each party shall be liable only for the amount of 
1
damages allocated to such party in direct proportion to 
2
such party’s percentage of responsibility. Whenever a 
3
judgment of liability is rendered as to any party, a sepa-
4
rate judgment shall be rendered against each such party 
5
for the amount allocated to such party. For purposes of 
6
this section, the trier of fact shall determine the propor-
7
tion of responsibility of each party for the claimant’s 
8
harm. 
9
(e) STATE FLEXIBILITY.—No provision of this sec-
10
tion shall be construed to preempt any State law (whether 
11
effective before, on, or after the date of the enactment of 
12
this Act) that specifies a particular monetary amount of 
13
economic or noneconomic damages (or the total amount 
14
of damages) that may be awarded in a health care lawsuit, 
15
regardless of whether such monetary amount is greater 
16
or lesser than is provided for under this section. 
17
SEC. 5. MAXIMIZING PATIENT RECOVERY. 
18
(a) COURT SUPERVISION OF SHARE OF DAMAGES 
19
ACTUALLY PAID TO CLAIMANTS.—In any health care law-
20
suit, the court shall supervise the arrangements for pay-
21
ment of damages to protect against conflicts of interest 
22
that may have the effect of reducing the amount of dam-
23
ages awarded that are actually paid to claimants. In par-
24
ticular, in any health care lawsuit in which the attorney 
25
05:11 Dec 28, 2022
H9584
9 
•HR 9584 IH
for a party claims a financial stake in the outcome by vir-
1
tue of a contingent fee, the court shall have the power 
2
to restrict the payment of a claimant’s damage recovery 
3
to such attorney, and to redirect such damages to the 
4
claimant based upon the interests of justice and principles 
5
of equity. In no event shall the total of all contingent fees 
6
for representing all claimants in a health care lawsuit ex-
7
ceed the following limits: 
8
(1) Forty percent of the first $50,000 recovered 
9
by the claimant(s). 
10
(2) Thirty-three and one-third percent of the 
11
next $50,000 recovered by the claimant(s). 
12
(3) Twenty-five percent of the next $500,000 
13
recovered by the claimant(s). 
14
(4) Fifteen percent of any amount by which the 
15
recovery by the claimant(s) is in excess of $600,000. 
16
(b) APPLICABILITY.—The limitations in this section 
17
shall apply whether the recovery is by judgment, settle-
18
ment, mediation, arbitration, or any other form of alter-
19
native dispute resolution. In a health care lawsuit involv-
20
ing a minor or incompetent person, a court retains the 
21
authority to authorize or approve a fee that is less than 
22
the maximum permitted under this section. The require-
23
ment for court supervision in the first two sentences of 
24
subsection (a) applies only in civil actions.

3
this Act) that specifies a lesser percentage or lesser total 
4
value of damages which may be claimed by an attorney 
5
representing a claimant in a health care lawsuit. 
6
SEC. 6. ADDITIONAL HEALTH BENEFITS. 
7
(a) COLLATERAL SOURCE BENEFITS.—In any health 
8
care lawsuit involving injury or wrongful death, any party 
9
may introduce evidence of collateral source benefits. If a 
10
party elects to introduce such evidence, any opposing party 
11
may introduce evidence of any amount paid or contributed 
12
or reasonably likely to be paid or contributed in the future 
13
by or on behalf of the opposing party to secure the right 
14
to such collateral source benefits. 
15
(b) SUBROGATION.—No provider of collateral source 
16
benefits shall recover any amount against the claimant or 
17
receive any lien or credit against the claimant’s recovery 
18
or be equitably or legally subrogated to the right of the 
19
claimant in a health care lawsuit involving injury or 
20
wrongful death. 
21
(c) APPLICABILITY.—This section shall apply to any 
22
health care lawsuit that is settled as well as a health care

(a) IN GENERAL.—In any health care lawsuit, if an 
12
award of future damages, without reduction to present 
13
value, equaling or exceeding $50,000 is made against a 
14
party with sufficient insurance or other assets to fund a 
15
periodic payment of such a judgment, the court shall, at 
16
the request of any party, enter a judgment ordering that 
17
the future damages be paid by periodic payments, in ac-
18
