SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. 
1
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that— 
2
(1) the manufacture, distribution, and importa-
3
tion of firearms is inherently commercial in nature; 
4
05:12 May 13, 2022
H7730
3 
•HR 7730 IH
(2) firearms regularly move in interstate com-
1
merce; 
2
(3) to the extent that firearms trafficking is 
3
intrastate in nature, it arises out of and is substan-
4
tially connected with a commercial transaction that, 
5
when viewed in the aggregate, substantially affects 
6
interstate commerce; 
7
(4) because the intrastate and interstate traf-
8
ficking of firearms are so commingled, full regula-
9
tion of interstate commerce requires the incidental 
10
regulation of intrastate commerce; 
11
(5) firearm-related assaults in the United 
12
States during the 19-year period between 2001 and 
13
2019 were— 
14
(A) associated with the majority of homi-
15
cides and half of all suicides; and 
16
(B) the seventh leading cause of nonfatal 
17
violent injuries; 
18
(6) on the afternoon of May 10, 2007, Blair 
19
Holt, a junior at Julian High School in Chicago, was 
20
killed on a public bus riding home from school when 
21
he used his body to shield a girl who was in the line 
22
of fire after a young man boarded the bus and start-
23
ed shooting;

•HR 7730 IH
(7) since 2007, when 32 students and teachers 
1
were killed at Virginia Tech, 7 of the 11 most deadly 
2
mass shootings in the United States have taken 
3
place; 
4
(8) since 2012, when 20 first graders and 
5
teachers were murdered with an assault rifle at 
6
Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Con-
7
necticut, more than 230 school shootings have oc-
8
curred in the United States; 
9
(9) in 2015, there were 335 mass shootings, in-
10
cluding, notably, the shooting at Umpqua Commu-
11
nity College in Oregon, the Charleston church shoot-
12
ing in South Carolina, the theater shooting in La-
13
fayette, Louisiana, and the Isla Vista community 
14
shootings in California; 
15
(10) since 2016, the country has witnessed 4 of 
16
the 10 most deadly mass shootings in modern 
17
United States history; 
18
(11) in February 2018, 17 members of the 
19
Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School community 
20
in Parkland, Florida, lost their lives at the hands of 
21
a 19-year-old armed with an AR–15 semiautomatic 
22
assault rifle; 
23
(12) according to the Federal Bureau of Inves-
24
tigation, the criminal homicide rate increased from 
25
05:12 May 13, 2022
H7730
5 
•HR 7730 IH
5.1 per 100,000 people in 2019 to 6.5 per 100,000 
1
people in 2020, the largest single year increase in at 
2
least the past 6 decades and approximately 73 per-
3
cent of 2019 criminal homicides are estimated to 
4
have been firearms-related, while approximately 77 
5
percent of 2020 criminal homicides are estimated to 
6
have been firearms-related; 
7
(13) communities of color suffer disproportion-
8
ately from gun violence, with Black children and 
9
teens 14 percent more likely to die of gun violence 
10
than their White counterparts and Latino children 
11
and teens 3 times more likely to die of gun violence 
12
than their White counterparts; and 
13
(14) between 2015 and 2020, there were 2,429 
14
mass shootings, including 611 in 2020 alone. 
15
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
16
gress that— 
17
(1) firearms trafficking is prevalent and wide-
18
spread in and among the States, and it is usually 
19
impossible to distinguish between intrastate traf-
20
ficking and interstate trafficking; and 
21
(2) it is in the national interest and within the 
22
role of the Federal Government to ensure that the 
23
regulation of firearms is uniform among the States, 
24
that law enforcement can quickly and effectively 
25

trace firearms used in crime, and that firearms own-
1
ers know how to use and safely store their firearms. 
2
(c) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this Act and the 
3
amendments made by this Act are— 
4
(1) to protect the public against the unreason-
5
able risk of injury and negligent or reckless death 
6
associated with the unrecorded sale or transfer of 
7
qualifying firearms to criminals and youths; 
8
(2) to ensure that owners of qualifying firearms 
9
are knowledgeable in the safe use, handling, and 
10
storage of those firearms; 
11
(3) to restrict the availability of qualifying fire-
12
arms to criminals, youth, and other persons prohib-
13
ited by Federal law from receiving firearms; 
14
(4) to facilitate the tracing of qualifying fire-
15
arms used in crime by Federal and State law en-
16
forcement agencies; and 
17
(5) to hold criminally and civilly liable those 
18
who facilitate the transfer of qualifying firearms, 
19
causing risk of injury and negligent or reckless 
20
death associated with the transfer of those quali-
21
fying firearms.
