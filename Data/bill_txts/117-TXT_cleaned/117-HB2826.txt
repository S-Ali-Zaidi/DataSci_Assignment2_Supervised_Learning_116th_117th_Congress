SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
1
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) According to the Intergovernmental Panel 
3
on Climate Change, the Earth’s climate is now 
4
changing faster than at any point in history. 
5
(2) The October 2018 report entitled ‘‘Special 
6
Report on Global Warming of 1.5o C’’ by the Inter-
7
governmental Panel on Climate Change and the No-
8
vember 2018 Fourth National Climate Assessment 
9
report found that a changing climate is— 
10
(A) causing sea levels to rise; 
11
(B) contributing to an increase in wildfires 
12
and temperature extremes in some parts of the 
13
world; and 
14
(C) contributing to an increase in heavy 
15
precipitation in certain locations. 
16
(3) Forced displacement and forced migration 
17
are increasing in the context of environmental 
18
changes and climate-induced disruptions, including 
19
weather-related disasters, drought, famine, and ris-
20
ing sea levels. 
21
(4) A December 2019 Oxfam International re-
22
port found that climate-related events forced an esti-

mated 20,000,000 people from their homes every 
1
year during the previous decade. 
2
(5) The United Nations Human Rights Council 
3
has recognized that climate change poses an existen-
4
tial threat that has already negatively affected the 
5
fulfilment of human rights, specifically noting that— 
6
(A) parties should, when taking action to 
7
address climate change, respect, promote and 
8
consider their respective obligations on human 
9
rights; and 
10
(B) the adverse effects of climate change 
11
are felt most acutely by those segments of the 
12
population that are already in vulnerable situa-
13
tions owing to factors such as geography, pov-
14
erty, gender, age, indigenous or minority status, 
15
national or social origin, birth, or other status 
16
and disability. 
17
(6) The Office of the United Nations High 
18
Commissioner for Human Rights has suggested that 
19
a person who cannot be reasonably expected to re-
20
turn to his or her country of origin— 
21
(A) should be considered a victim of forced 
22
displacement; and 
23

(B) should be granted at least a temporary 
1
stay in the country where they have found ref-
2
uge. 
3
(7) The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
4
Change affirms with high confidence that societal 
5
adaptations in the near term can help reduce the 
6
risks of climate change throughout the 21st century. 
7
(8) In 2013, Super Typhoon Haiyan made 
8
landfall 
in 
the 
Philippines, 
affecting 
nearly 
9
15,000,000 people and displacing more than 
10
4,000,000 people. 
11
(9) Since 2017, violence in Burma’s Rakhine 
12
State has forced more than 740,000 Rohingya refu-
13
gees into Bangladesh, where they remain exposed to 
14
the country’s vulnerability to the effects of extreme 
15
flooding and landslides worsened by climate change. 
16
(10) In 2020, extreme rainfall and flooding in 
17
Northeast India’s Assam State displaced more than 
18
3,300,000 people. 
19
(11) The small Pacific island Nation of Kiribati 
20
is preparing for large swaths of the country to be 
21
uninhabitable and for its people to migrate with the 
22
skill to integrate into their new host nation. 
23
(12) More than 150,000,000 people around the 
24
world now live on land that may be below sea level

or regular flood levels by the end of the century un-
1
less adaptation measures are taken. 
2
(13) The effects of climate change also exacer-
3
bate social, economic, and political tensions within 
4
and among nations. 
5
(14) A 2020 CARE report, ‘‘Evicted by Climate 
6
Change: Confronting the Gendered Impacts of Cli-
7
mate-Induced Displacement’’, notes that— 
8
(A) the climate crisis exacerbates gender 
9
inequality and makes it harder to achieve gen-
10
der justice; 
11
(B) more than half of the 41,000,000 peo-
12
ple internally displaced in 2018 were women; 
13
(C) poor women and children are up to 14 
14
times more likely to be killed than men by a cli-
15
mate-fueled disaster, such as a hurricane, ty-
16
phoon, cyclone, or flood; and 
17
(D) women who are displaced by climate 
18
change related impacts often have less access to 
19
relief resources. 
20
(15) In 2014, the Department of Defense 
21
Quadrennial Defense Review cited the effects of cli-
22
mate change as a ‘‘threat multiplier’’ that could lead 
23
to violence abroad.

(16) In 2016, a memorandum from the Na-
1
tional Intelligence Counsel entitled ‘‘Implications for 
2
U.S. National Security of Anticipated Climate 
3
Change’’ highlighted how climate change could cre-
4
ate or aggravate tensions between nations in already 
5
disputed regions, such as the Arctic. 
6
(17) The 2020 Ecological Threat Register pub-
7
lished by the Institute for Economics and Peace 
8
projects that climate-related threats will continue to 
9
cause significant displacement worldwide over the 
10
coming decades. Nineteen countries, with a com-
11
bined population of 2,100,000,000 people, are noted 
12
to be most at risk given population growth, water 
13
stress, food insecurity, droughts, floods, cyclones and 
14
rising temperature and sea levels. 
15
(18) In February 2021, President Biden sig-
16
naled his intention to raise the United States ref-
17
ugee resettlement goal. 
18
(19) In January 2021, President Biden issued 
19
Executive Order 14008 on tackling the climate crisis 
20
domestically and abroad. The order affirmed climate 
21
considerations essential to United States foreign and 
22
defense policy, reaffirmed the role of the Special 
23
Envoy for Climate John Kerry, created a national 
24
climate task force, and set timelines to produce

strategies and implementation plans for integrating 
1
climate considerations into foreign policy efforts. 
2
(20) Previous presidential administrations have 
3
not systematically and specifically acted to address 
4
climate displacement or to provide appropriate dura-
5
ble solutions to those who are displaced. 
6
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
7
gress that the United States should— 
8
(1) reduce its domestic greenhouse gas emis-
9
sions on a scale and rate proportionate to its histor-
10
ical responsibility and the urgency of the threat of 
11
climate change; 
12
(2) welcome the shared responsibility of climate 
13
change adaptation, global disaster risk reduction, re-
14
siliency building, and disaster response and recovery; 
15
(3) assist in providing durable solutions for cli-
16
mate-displaced persons; 
17
(4) aid other countries in their climate change 
18
mitigation efforts; and 
19
(5) work with the international community— 
20
(A) to establish a framework to share such 
21
responsibilities; and 
22
(B) to ensure that the human rights of cli-
23
mate-displaced persons are acknowledged, re-
24
spected, protected, and fulfilled.
