SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Approximately 37,000,000 adults in the 
3
United States have a chronic kidney disease, and 
4
kidney diseases are the ninth leading cause of death 
5
in the United States. 
6
(2) Each day in the United States, on average, 
7
340 people begin dialysis and 13 people die waiting 
8
for a kidney transplant. 
9
(3) Rare kidney diseases like focal segmental 
10
glomerulosclerosis 
and 
immunoglobulin 
A 
11
nephropathy are particularly difficult to treat, and 
12
there are no approved treatments for these diseases. 
13
04:24 Apr 15, 2022
H7506
3 
•HR 7506 IH
(4) In the absence of approved treatment op-
1
tions, more than 100,000 people live with rare glo-
2
merular kidney disease and face dialysis, transplant, 
3
or death. 
4
(5) Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is asso-
5
ciated with a 50 percent risk of end-stage kidney 
6
disease within 5 years of diagnosis if partial or com-
7
plete remission is not achieved. 
8
(6) Between 20 and 40 percent of individuals 
9
with immunoglobulin A nephropathy are expected to 
10
develop end-stage kidney disease within 20 years. 
11
(7) Rare kidney diseases disproportionately af-
12
fect Black Americans, who are 3.5 times more likely 
13
to develop end-stage kidney disease, and 5 times 
14
more likely than the general population to have focal 
15
segmental glomerulosclerosis. 
16
(8) Because approximately one-third of Black 
17
Americans with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis 
18
cases are associated with a particular gene, commu-
19
nities of color would benefit from additional re-
20
sources to support earlier detection, including ge-
21
netic and genomic testing and referrals to high-qual-
22
ity providers. 
23
(9) The prevalence of end-stage kidney disease 
24
is exacerbated by diagnostic challenges, barriers to 
25
04:24 Apr 15, 2022
H7506
4 
•HR 7506 IH
high-quality care, and lack of awareness of disease 
1
risks. 
2
(10) Federal spending on end-stage kidney dis-
3
ease currently accounts for approximately 7 percent 
4
of Federal Medicare spending. 
5
(11) The total Medicare spending on both 
6
chronic kidney disease and end-stage kidney disease 
7
patients exceeded $120,000,000,000 per year in re-
8
cent years. 
9
(12) A focus on renal health and the prevention 
10
of end-stage kidney disease would improve patient 
11
outcomes, extend lives, mitigate racial health care 
12
disparities, and reduce government spending. 
13
(13) Due in large part to the 21st Century 
14
Cures Act, new regulatory paradigms have unleashed 
15
a wave of clinical innovation in the rare kidney dis-
16
ease space. 
17
(14) In 2020, the first-ever Rare Kidney Dis-
18
ease Roundtable outlined urgent needs in the areas 
19
of diagnosis, education, communities of color, and 
20
patient support for rare kidney disease patients and 
21
their families in the United States. 
22
(15) In 2021, there are over 30 ongoing clinical 
23
trials underway for treatments for a range of rare 
24
kidney diseases, offering the first hope for novel 
25
04:24 Apr 15, 2022

therapies for patients living with rare kidney dis-
1
eases, a new era of preventing end-stage kidney dis-
2
ease and related Federal costs, and the possibility of 
3
improving chronic kidney care writ large.
