It is the policy of the United States— 
2
(1) to strengthen the prohibition against the 
3
importation of goods made with forced labor, includ-

7

8
all ‘‘goods, wares, articles, and merchandise mined, 
9
produced or manufactured wholly or in part in any 
10
foreign country by * * * forced labor’’; 
11
(2) to lead the international community in end-
12
ing forced labor practices wherever such practices 
13
occur through all means available to the United 
14
States Government, including by stopping the impor-
15
tation of any goods made with forced labor, includ-
16
ing those goods mined, produced, or manufactured 
17
wholly or in part in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autono-
18

9
