clude health care fraud, health insurance fraud, counter-
feit prescription drug fraud, funeral and cemetery fraud, 
‘‘anti-aging’’ product fraud, telemarketing fraud, and

olution, exploiting the ongoing Coronavirus Disease 2019

ety of scams, including Economic Impact Payment 
scams, test kit scams, contact tracing scams, work-from- 
home scams, and COVID–19 vaccine survey scams;

mittee on Aging of the Senate has received more than 
10,000 complaints reporting possible scams from individ-

through the internet and telephone increases as more cre-
ative schemes emerge;

older of $1,300, nearly 4 times the median amount lost
