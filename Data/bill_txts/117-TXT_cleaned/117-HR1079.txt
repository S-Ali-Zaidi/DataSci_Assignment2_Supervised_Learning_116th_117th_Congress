RESOLUTION 
Supporting the designation of December 5 of each year as 
‘‘National Soil Health Day’’. 
Whereas soil is an essential natural resource, and farmers 
and professionals in the United States play a critical role 
in managing United States soil and water resources; 
Whereas the Natural Resources Conservation Service of the 
Department of Agriculture defines soil health as the con-
tinued capacity of soil to function as a vital living eco-
system that sustains plants, animals, and humans; 
Whereas the concept of soil health across the United States 
landscape is not new, but is only recently recognized as 
needed to prevent soil degradation and combat climate 
change;

Whereas the degradation of soil can be rapid, while the for-
mation and regeneration processes can be very slow; 
Whereas the protection of United States soil is essential to 
the long-term prosperity and sustainability of the soil and 
water resources of the Nation; 
Whereas the 6 basic principles of soil health necessary for 
that protection are to— 
(1) minimize soil disturbance and external inputs, 
including reduced tillage; 
(2) maximize plant and microbial diversity; 
(3) maintain the presence of living roots; 
(4) keep the soil covered, including with cover crops 
and crop residue, to armor the soil; 
(5) integrate animals into land management, includ-
ing grazing animals, birds, beneficial insects, or keystone 
species, such as earthworms; and 
(6) incorporate the context of local conditions in de-
cision making, including, for example, soil type, topog-
raphy, and time of year; 
Whereas soil health principles and its associated practices of 
no-till, cover crops, nutrient management plans, and 
longer crop rotations enhance the ability of farmers to 
meet the nonpoint source pollution goals for nitrate-nitro-
gen and phosphorus; 
Whereas it is essential to reduce the amount of nutrients 
flowing off of farm fields and into United States water-
sheds, and with these reduced nutrient losses from agri-
culture lands, farmers will be able to meet desired out-
comes as outlined by the Mississippi River Basin Hypoxia 
Task Force for the Gulf of Mexico;

Whereas soil health principles provide for the reduction of 
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere through the sequestra-
tion of carbon within the upper reaches of the soil profile, 
and this carbon mitigation improves the organic matter 
content in the soil and provides a stable biome for soil 
organisms, improves nutrient transfer from soil to root, 
and increases water infiltration and water-holding capac-
ity; 
Whereas despite soil’s importance to human health, the envi-
ronment, nutrition and food, feed, fiber, and fuel produc-
tion, there is little public awareness of the importance of 
soil protection; and 
Whereas the United States should be actively raising aware-
ness of the importance of soil health and promoting its 
stewardship to safeguard this resource for future genera-
tions of United States citizens: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the designation of ‘‘National Soil 
2
Health Day’’; and 
3
(2) calls upon this celebration and its related 
4
activities to improve the awareness of United States 
5
farmers and agribusiness toward the importance of 
6
the air and water quality environment for all of the 
7
citizens of the United States.
