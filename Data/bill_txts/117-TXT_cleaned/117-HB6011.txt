ings:

•HR 6011 IH
(1) Excessive globalization has been a disaster 
1
for United States workers in the manufacturing sec-
2
tor. 
3
(2) The erosion of the domestic industrial base 
4
of the United States is the result of the lack of ade-
5
quate protection for both domestic industry and 
6
United States workers from import competition. 
7
(3) Since 2001, approximately 60,000 factories 
8
have shuttered in the United States. 
9
(4) The COVID–19 pandemic revealed the de-
10
gree to which the United States is dependent on the 
11
People’s Republic of China for certain critical manu-
12
factured goods. 
13
(5) The United States currently mandates do-
14
mestic sourcing by requiring certain government 
15
agencies to purchase only goods that are produced in 
16
whole or in part in the United States. 
17
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
18
gress that a targeted regime of local content requirements 
19
across manufactured goods sold in the United States 
20
should be deployed to boost domestic industry, repatriate 
21
supply chains, and nurture infant industries.
