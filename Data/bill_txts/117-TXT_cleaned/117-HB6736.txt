SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
1
It is the sense of Congress that— 
2
(1) the victim-centered approach must become 
3
universally understood, adopted, and practiced; 
4
(2) criminal justice efforts must increase the 
5
focus on, and adeptness at, investigating and pros-
6
ecuting forced labor cases; 
7
(3) corporations must eradicate forced labor 
8
from their supply chains; 
9
(4) the Department of Homeland Security must 
10
lead by example— 
11
(A) by ensuring that its government supply 
12
chain of contracts and procurement are not 
13
tainted by forced labor; and 
14
(B) by leveraging all of its authorities 
15
against the importation of goods produced with 
16
forced labor; and 
17
(5) human trafficking training, awareness, iden-
18
tification, and screening efforts— 
19
(A) are a necessary first step for preven-
20
tion, protection, and enforcement; and 
21
(B) should be evidence-based to be most 
22
effective.
