CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 
Recognizing international days of peace, coexistence, and 
cooperation. 
Whereas the preamble to the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights says that ‘‘disregard and contempt for 
human rights have resulted in barbarous acts which have 
outraged the conscience of humankind, and the advent of 
a world in which human beings shall enjoy freedom of 
speech and belief and freedom from fear and want has 
been proclaimed as the highest aspiration of the common 
people’’; 
Whereas the Constitution of the United Nations Educational, 
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) reminds

us that ‘‘a peace based exclusively upon the political and 
economic arrangements of Governments would not be a 
peace which could secure the unanimous, lasting and sin-
cere support of the peoples of the world, and the peace 
must therefore be founded, if it is not to fail, upon the 
intellectual and moral solidarity of mankind’’; 
Whereas the 2021 Global Peace Index found peacefulness has 
declined year-on-year for 9 of the last 13 years; 
Whereas the 2021 Global Peace Index also noted that for the 
past 15 years there has been a persistent decrease in the 
world’s peacefulness and that global violence cost $14.96 
trillion in 2020; 
Whereas strengthening and supporting domestic and global 
efforts to study, discuss, teach, and develop techniques 
and methods to encourage and augment global peace ef-
forts is a critical international goal; 
Whereas, on November 30, 1981, during the 77th plenary 
meeting, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a 
resolution to declare the third Tuesday of September as 
the International Day of Peace; 
Whereas nearly 20 years later, the United Nations General 
Assembly adopted A/RES/55/282, which officially des-
ignated September 21 as a global day to recognize and 
celebrate international cease-fire and nonviolence; 
Whereas, in 2001, the United Nations Economic and Social 
Council Organization proclaimed November 10 as World 
Science Day for Peace and Development; 
Whereas, on February 24, 2003, the United Nations General

darity as a fundamental and universal value underlying

Whereas, on June 15, 2007, the United Nations General As-

the efforts of the international community to promote 
peace, tolerance, inclusion, understanding and solidarity, 
in order to build a sustainable world of peace, solidarity 
and harmony’’; 
Whereas attaining peace involves the active and persistent 
process of persuading people of the benefits of peace, co-
operation, tolerance, and nonviolence; 
Whereas peace is only attainable via a sustained commitment 
by a critical mass of those striving to do good; and 
Whereas peace is a global goal that can only be achieved 
through thoughtful, deliberative, cooperative actions that 
center peace as their primary objective: Now, therefore, 
be it
