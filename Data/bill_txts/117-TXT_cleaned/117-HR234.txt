RESOLUTION 
Acknowledging the history and lasting impact of the Federal 
Government-created problem of redlining and the respon-
sibility of the Federal Government to address such im-
pact. 
Whereas access to opportunity plays a fundamental role in 
determining the prospects of an individual with respect to 
achieving upward mobility and the American Dream;

Whereas where an individual lives plays an outsized role in 
determining the access of such individual to life-altering 
opportunities, such as finding a well-paying job and 
avoiding illnesses caused by environmental factors; 
Whereas a persistent wealth gap exists in the United States 
between the wealthy and the vast majority of Americans, 
a gap that particularly impacts communities of color; 
Whereas a lack of wealth increases the vulnerability of a fam-
ily to socioeconomic emergencies, such as health-related 
emergencies that can cause financial ruin; 
Whereas an income gap only explains a small portion of the 
racial wealth gap; 
Whereas housing, as the most common household asset and 
largest source of private wealth, is the largest driver of 
the racial wealth gap; 
Whereas Federal Government redlining provided the financial 
foundation and legal impetus for the racially discrimina-
tory housing practices principally responsible for a dis-
parity in housing wealth; 
Whereas redlining used the authority of the Federal Govern-
ment and leveraged the borrowing power of that Govern-
ment to reinforce racially discriminatory incentive struc-
tures in the housing market that substantially contrib-
uted to the persistent segregation still seen today; 
Whereas segregation creates an additional barrier to upward 
mobility for minority communities by concentrating dis-
advantage regardless of income; 
Whereas neighborhoods with high concentrations of Jews and 
immigrants from Ireland, Italy, Poland, and other East-
ern European countries were also redlined, creating a 
multiethnic diaspora of the intentionally marginalized;

Whereas the financial crisis of 2007 and 2008 exacerbated 
the racial wealth gap; 
Whereas intentionally malicious and racially motivated lend-
ing practices by large financial institutions directly re-
sulted in the widening of the racial wealth gap in the 
ruthless pursuit of profits; 
Whereas efforts to incentivize the private sector to lend to the 
victims of redlining and historically financially under-
served areas have failed to generate the private lending 
necessary to close the wealth gap or address disparate ac-
cess to credit; and 
Whereas the COVID–19 pandemic has disproportionately im-
pacted communities of color and further exacerbated the 
systemic poverty and barriers to opportunity and wealth 
cultivation that are woven into the fabric of the economic 
infrastructure of the United States: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That— 
1
(1) the history and lasting impact of the Fed-
2
eral Government-created problem of redlining; and 
3
(2) that the Federal Government has a respon-
4
sibility to take any and all necessary affirmative ac-
5
tions to ameliorate the direct negative impacts of 
6
redlining, including through the creation, preserva-
7
tion, and maintenance of equitable economic oppor-
8
tunities and recovery efforts in response to the 
9
COVID–19 pandemic.
