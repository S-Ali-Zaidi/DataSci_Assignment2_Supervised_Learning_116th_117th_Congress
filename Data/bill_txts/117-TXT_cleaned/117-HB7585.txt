SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
1
The Congress finds as follows: 
2
(1) The population of racial and ethnic minori-
3
ties is expected to increase over the next few dec-
4
ades, yet racial and ethnic minorities have the poor-
5
est health status and face substantial cultural, so-
6
cial, and economic barriers to obtaining high-quality 
7
health care. 
8
(2) Health disparities are a function of not only 
9
access to health care, but also the social deter-
10
minants of health—including the environment, the 
11
physical structure of communities, nutrition and 
12
food options, educational attainment, employment, 
13
race, ethnicity, sex, geography, language preference, 
14
immigrant or citizenship status, sexual orientation, 
15
gender identity, socioeconomic status, or disability 
16
status—that directly and indirectly affect the health, 
17
health care, and wellness of individuals and commu-
18
nities. 
19
(3) Over the next few decades, the United 
20
States will face a shortage of health care providers 
21
and allied health workers. 
22
(4) All efforts to reduce health disparities and 
23
barriers to high-quality health services require better 
24
and more consistent data, and better and more con-
25
sistent collection of and access to data.

•HR 7585 IH
(5) A full range of culturally and linguistically 
1
appropriate health care and public health services 
2
must be available and accessible in every community. 
3
(6) Racial and ethnic minorities and under-
4
served populations must be included early and equi-
5
tably in health reform innovations. 
6
(7) Efforts to improve minority health have 
7
been limited by inadequate resources in funding, 
8
staffing, stewardship, and accountability. Targeted 
9
investments that are focused on disparities elimi-
10
nation must be made in providing care and services 
11
that are community-based, including prevention and 
12
policies addressing social determinants of health. 
13
(8) In 2011, the Department of Health and 
14
Human Services developed the HHS Action Plan to 
15
Reduce Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities and 
16
the National Stakeholder Strategy for Achieving 
17
Health Equity, which are 2 strategic plans that rep-
18
resent the first coordinated roadmap in the United 
19
States to reducing health disparities. These com-
20
prehensive plans, along with the National Prevention 
21
Strategy issued by the National Prevention Council 
22
of the Department of Health and Human Services,

2012 National Healthcare Quality and Disparities 
2
Reports, will work to increase the number of people 
3
in the United States who are healthy at every stage 
4
of life. 
5
(9) The Secretary of Health and Human Serv-
6
ices has also reviewed and advanced updated clinical 
7
guidelines and developed other strategic planning 
8
documents to combat health disparities with a high 
9
impact on minority populations and to provide high- 
10
quality family planning services. Such guidelines and 
11
documents include the National HIV/AIDS Strategy, 
12
the Action Plan for the Prevention, Care, and Treat-
13
ment of Viral Hepatitis, and recommendations of the 
14
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the 
15

11
(a) DEFINITIONS.—In this title, the definitions in 
12
section 3400 of the Public Health Service Act, as added 
13
by section 2004, shall apply. 
14
(b) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
15
(1) Effective communication is essential to 
16
meaningful access to quality physical and mental 
17
health care. 
18
(2) Research indicates that the lack of appro-
19
priate language services creates language barriers 
20
that result in increased risk of misdiagnosis, ineffec-
21
tive treatment plans, and poor health outcomes for 
22
individuals with limited English proficiency and indi-
23
viduals with communication disabilities such as cog-
24
nitive, hearing, vision, or print impairments.

•HR 7585 IH
(3) The number of limited English speaking 
1
residents in the United States who speak English 
2
less than very well and, therefore, cannot effectively 
3
communicate with health and social service providers 
4
continues to increase significantly. 
5
(4) The responsibility to fund language services 
6
in the provision of health care and health care-re-
7
lated services to individuals with limited English 
8
proficiency and individuals with communication dis-
9
abilities such as cognitive hearing, vision, or print 
10
impairments is a societal one that cannot fairly be 
11
placed solely upon the health care, public health, or 
12
social services community. 
13
(5) Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 
14
U.S.C. 2000d et seq.) prohibits discrimination based 
15
on the grounds of race, color, or national origin by 
16
any entity receiving Federal financial assistance. In 
17
order to avoid discrimination on the grounds of na-
18
tional origin, all programs or activities administered 
19
by the Federal Government must take adequate 
20
steps to ensure that their policies and procedures do 
21
not deny or have the effect of denying individuals 
22
with limited English proficiency with equal access to 
23
benefits and services for which such persons qualify.

(6) Both the Americans with Disabilities Act of 
1
1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.) and the Rehabilita-
2
tion Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 701 et seq.) prohibit 
3
discrimination on the basis of disability and require 
4
the provision of appropriate auxiliary aids and serv-
5
ices necessary to ensure effective communication 
6
with individuals with disabilities. The type of auxil-
7
iary aid or service necessary to ensure effective com-
8
munication will vary in accordance with the method 
9
of communication used by the individual; the nature, 
10
length, and complexity of the communication in-
11
volved; and the context in which the communication 
12
is taking place. A public accommodation should con-
13
sult with individuals with disabilities whenever pos-
14
sible to determine what type of auxiliary aid is need-
15
ed to ensure effective communication. The public ac-
16
commodation should use the individual’s preferred 
17
method of communication whenever possible, unless 
18
it would be an undue burden to the public accommo-
19
dation and an alternative would provide an equally 
20
effective means of communication. The ultimate de-
21
cision as to what measures to take rests with the 
22
public accommodation, provided that the method 
23
chosen results in effective communication.

24
Medical Colleges and other expert entities, such as

•HR 7585 IH
the Health Resources and Services Administration, 
1
have indicated a nationwide shortage of up to 
2
121,900 physicians, split evenly between primary 
3
care and specialists, by 2032. 
4
(2) Primarily due to the growing and aging 
5
population, over the next decade, physician demand 
6
is expected to grow up to 17 percent. 
7
(3) The United States Census Bureau estimates 
8
that the United States population will grow from 
9
321,000,000 in 2015 to 347,000,000 in 2025. Fur-
10
ther, the number of Medicare beneficiaries is esti-
11
mated to increase from 47,800,000 in 2015 to ap-
12
proximately 66,000,000 in 2025. 
13
(4) Approximately 36 percent of practicing phy-
14
sicians are over the age of 55 and are likely to retire 
15
within the next decade. 
16
(5) A nationwide physician shortage will result 
17
in many individuals in the United States waiting 
18
longer and traveling farther for health care; seeking 
19
nonemergent care in emergency departments; and 
20
delaying treatment until the health care needs of 
21
such individuals become more serious, complex, and 
22
costly. 
23
(6) Changing demographics (such as an aging 
24
population), new health care delivery models (such 
25
20:42 Jun 23, 2022
H7585
230 
•HR 7585 IH
as medical homes), and other factors (such as dis-
1
aster preparedness) are contributing to a shortage of 
2
both generalist and specialist physicians. 
3
(7) These shortages will have the most severe 
4
impact on vulnerable and underserved populations, 
5
including racial and ethnic minorities and the ap-
6
proximately 20 percent of people in the United 
7
States who live in rural or inner-city locations des-
8
ignated as health professional shortage areas. 
9
(8) The health care utilization equity model of 
10
the Association of American Medical Colleges esti-
11
mates that if racial and ethnic minorities and indi-
12
viduals from rural areas utilized health care in a 
13
similar way to their Caucasian counterparts living in 
14
metropolitan areas, the physician shortage would re-
15
quire an additional 96,000 physicians. 
16
(9) To address the physician shortage in rural 
17
and medically underserved areas, medical education 
18
and training need to be accessible to underrep-
19
resented minorities (including individuals who are 
20
African American, Hispanic, Native American, or 
21
Native Hawaiian), and need to increase pathway 
22
programs for such underrepresented minorities who 
23
make up less than 12 percent of individuals enrolled 
24
in graduate medical education and for international

students who make up 25 percent of individuals en-
1
rolled in graduate medical education. Immigration 
2
pathways like student, exchange-visitor, and employ-
3
ment visas, and programs like the National Interest 
4
Waiver and Conrad 30 J–1 Visa Waiver, help im-
5
prove health access across the United States. 
6
(10) United States medical school enrollment 
7
was expected to grow by 30 percent from 2018 to 
8
2019 to help reduce the shortage of quality physi-
9
cians in the United States. 
10
(11) An increase in United States medical 
11
school graduates must be accompanied by an in-
12
crease of 4,000 graduate medical education training 
13
positions each year. 
14
(12) Graduate medical education programs and 
15
teaching hospitals provide venues in which the next 
16
generation of physicians learns to work collabo-
17
ratively with other physicians and health profes-
18
sionals, adopt more efficient care delivery models 
19
(such as care coordination and medical homes), in-
20
corporate health information technology and elec-
21
tronic health records in every aspect of their work, 
22
apply new methods of assuring quality and safety, 
23
and participate in groundbreaking clinical and public 
24
health research.

(13) The Medicare program under title XVIII 
1
of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.) 
2
(having more beneficiaries than any other health 
3
care program), supports its ‘‘fair share’’ of the costs 
4
associated with graduate medical education. 
5
(14) In general, the level of support of graduate 
6
medical education by the Medicare program has 
7
been capped since 1997 and has not been increased 
8
to support the expansion of graduate medical edu-
9
cation programs needed to avert the projected physi-
10
cian shortage or to accommodate the increase in 
11
United States medical school graduates. 
12
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
13
gress that eliminating the limit of the number of residency 
14
positions that receive some level of Medicare support 
15
under section 1886(h) of the Social Security Act (42 
16
U.S.C. 1395ww(h)), also referred to as the Medical grad-
17
uate medical education cap, is critical to— 
18
(1) ensuring an appropriate supply of physi-
19
cians to meet the health care needs in the United 
20
States; 
21
(2) facilitating equitable access for all who seek 
22
health care;

physicians in the United States; and

ALLY EDUCATED HEALTH PROFESSIONALS.

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) According to a 2018 study, the State and 
6
local public health workforce has shrunk by more 
7
than 50,000 individuals since the beginning of the 
8
2008 Great Recession, and almost one quarter of in-
9
dividuals comprising the governmental public health 
10
workforce plan to leave or retire in the coming years. 
11
(2) Shortages are projected for other health 
12
professions, including within the fields of nursing 
13
(500,000 by 2025), dentistry (15,000 by 2025), 
14
pharmacy (38,000 by 2030), mental and behavioral 
15
health (236,880 by 2025), and primary care (46,000 
16
by 2025). 
17
(3) A nationwide health workforce shortage will 
18
result in serious health threats and more severe and 
19
costly health care needs, due to, in part, a delayed 
20
response to food-borne outbreaks, emerging infec-
21
tious diseases, natural disasters, fewer cancer 
22
screenings, and delayed treatment.

2
verely impacted by the health workforce shortage.

(5) According to the Migration Policy Institute, 
4
more than 2,000,000 college-educated immigrants in 
5
the United States today are unemployed or under-
6
employed in low- or semi-skilled jobs that fail to 
7
draw on their education and expertise. 
8
(6) Approximately 2 out of every 5 internation-
9
ally educated immigrants are unemployed or under-
10
employed. 
11
(7) According to the Drexel University Center 
12
for Labor Markets and Policy, underemployment for 
13
internationally educated immigrant women is 28 per-
14
cent higher than for their male counterparts. 
15
(8) According to the Drexel University Center 
16
for Labor Markets and Policy, the mean annual 
17
earnings 
of 
underemployed 
immigrants 
were 
18
$32,000, or 43 percent less than United States born 
19
college graduates employed in the college labor mar-
20
ket. 
21
(9) According to Upwardly Global and the Wel-
22
come Back Initiative, with proper guidance and sup-
23
port, underemployed skilled immigrants typically in-
24
crease their income by 215 percent to 900 percent.

•HR 7585 IH
(1) A special group of nurses in the Nation are 
1
the Hispanic nurses. 
2
(2) Hispanic nurses provide culturally and eth-
3
nically competent care and are educated to be sen-
4
sitive to regional and community customs of persons 
5
needing care. 
6
(3) Hispanic nurses are well-positioned to pro-
7
vide leadership to eliminate health care disparities 
8
that exist in the Nation. 
9
(4) Since 1975, the National Association of 
10
Hispanic Nurses (NAHN) has represented Hispanic 
11
nurses (RNs/LPNs) in the United States and is the 
12
only nursing organization for Hispanic nurses whose 
13
mission is to advance the health in Hispanic commu-
14
nities and to lead, promote, and advocate for edu-
15
cational, professional, and leadership opportunities 
16
for Hispanic nurses. 
17
(5) Since September is the month that has been 
18
set aside to honor the contributions of Hispanics, it 
19
is only fitting that Hispanic nurses be recognized 
20
and honored during this time for their outstanding 
21
contributions to their community and country.

100 nursing leaders from academia, research, edu-
4
cation, and practice in the District of Columbia for 
5
a day on Capitol Hill promoting legislation that im-
6
proves the health of Hispanic communities.

(8) Hispanic nurses are strong allies to Con-

17
Subtitle F—Equitable Health Care 
18
For All 
19
SEC. 4501. FINDINGS. 
20
Congress finds the following: 
21
(1) In 1966, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., said 
22
‘‘Of all the forms of inequality, injustice in health 
23
care is the most shocking and inhuman because it 
24
often results in physical death.’’. 
25
20:42 Jun 23, 2022
H7585
470 
•HR 7585 IH
(2) Inequity in health care remains a persistent 
1
and devastating reality for many communities, and, 
2
in particular, communities of color. 
3
(3) The provision of inequitable health care has 
4
complex causes, many stemming from systemic in-
5
equality in access to health care, housing, nutrition, 
6
economic opportunity, education, and other factors. 
7
(4) Health care outcomes for Black commu-
8
nities in particular lag far behind those of the popu-
9
lation as a whole. 
10
(5) Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the Na-
11
tional Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, 
12
said on April 7, 2020, the coronavirus outbreak is 
13
‘‘shining a bright light’’ on ‘‘unacceptable’’ health 
14
disparities in the Black community. 
15
(6) A contributing factor in health disparities is 
16
explicit and implicit bias in the delivery of health 
17
care, resulting in inferior care and poorer outcomes 
18
for some patients on the basis of factors that include 
19
race, national origin, sex (including sexual orienta-
20
tion or gender identity), disability, age, and religion. 
21
(7) The National Academy of Medicine (for-
22
merly known as the ‘‘Institute of Medicine’’) issued 
23
a report in 2002 titled ‘‘Unequal Treatment’’, find-
24
ing that racial and ethnic minorities receive lower- 
25
20:42 Jun 23, 2022
H7585
471 
•HR 7585 IH
quality health care than Whites do, even when insur-
1
ance status, income, age, and severity of condition is 
2
comparable. 
3
(8) Just as Congress has sought to eliminate 
4
bias, both explicit and implicit, in employment, hous-
5
ing, and other parts of our society, the elimination 
6
of bias and the legacy of structural racism in health 
7
care is of paramount importance.

BARRIERS TO ABORTION ACCESS AND VITAL

SOLUTIONS.

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
19
(1) Affordable, comprehensive health insurance 
20
that includes coverage for a full range of pregnancy- 
21
related care, including abortion, is critical to the 
22
health of every person regardless of actual or per-
23
ceived race, color, national origin, immigration sta-
24

•HR 7585 IH
tity, pregnancy, childbirth, a medical condition relat-
1
ing to pregnancy or childbirth, or sex stereotyping), 
2
age, or disability status. 
3
(2) Abortion services are essential to health 
4
care and access to those services is central to peo-
5
ple’s ability to participate equally in the economic 
6
and social life of the United States. Abortion access 
7
allows people who are pregnant to make their own 
8
decisions about their pregnancies, their families, and 
9
their lives. 
10
(3) Reproductive justice seeks to address re-
11
strictions on reproductive health, including abortion, 
12
that perpetuate systems of oppression, lack of bodily 
13
autonomy, White supremacy, and anti-Black racism. 
14
The violent legacy of these systems of oppression has 
15
manifested in policies including enslavement, rape, 
16
and experimentation on Black people, forced steri-
17
lizations, medical experimentation on low-income 
18
people’s reproductive systems, and the forcible re-
19
moval of Indigenous children. Access to equitable re-
20
productive health care, including abortion services, 
21
has always been deficient in the United States for 
22
Black, Indigenous, and other People of Color 
23
(BIPOC) and their families. Transgender, non-
24
binary, and gender-expansive individuals, and spe-

842 
•HR 7585 IH
cifically those who are Black, disabled, and at the 
1
intersections of multiple forms of oppression, also 
2
experience inequitable access to abortion services due 
3
to systemic violence. Centering abortion rights and 
4
access as a ‘‘women’s health’’ issue restricts access 
5
to those with reproductive needs who do not identify 
6
as cisgender women. In order to work towards repro-
7
ductive justice for all communities, transgender, 
8
nonbinary, and gender expansive must be centered 
9
in conversations of abortion access. Improving abor-
10
tion access for this community requires a gender- 
11
neutral approach to abortion care, rights, and justice 
12
policy. 
13
(4) The legacy of restrictions on reproductive 
14
health, rights, and justice is not a dated vestige of 
15
a dark history. Access to abortion services is ob-
16
structed across the United States in various ways, 
17
including blockades of health care facilities and asso-
18
ciated violence, prohibitions of, and restrictions on, 
19
insurance coverage, parental involvement laws (noti-
20
fication and consent), restrictions that shame and 
21
stigmatize people seeking abortion services, and 
22
medically unnecessary regulations that neither con-
23
fer any health benefit nor further the safety of abor-
24
tion services, but which harm people by delaying, 
25
20:42 Jun 23, 2022
H7585
843 
•HR 7585 IH
complicating access to, and reducing the availability 
1
of, abortion services. As of December 2, 2021, 19 
2
States have enacted 106 restrictions, including 12 
3
new abortion bans, making 2021 the year with the 
4
highest number of restrictions passed since Roe v. 
5
Wade was decided in 1973. Additionally, 21 States 
6
are poised to immediately ban or significantly re-
7
strict access to abortion services if the Supreme 
8
Court chooses to overturn or weaken Roe v. Wade. 
9
These unprecedented attacks on abortion rights and 
10
access fall especially heavily on people with low in-
11
comes, BIPOC, immigrants, young people, people 
12
with disabilities, those living in rural and other 
13
medically underserved areas, and transgender, non-
14
binary, and gender expansive individuals. 
15
(5) Since 1976, the Federal Government has 
16
withheld funds for abortion coverage in most cir-
17
cumstances through the Hyde amendment and simi-
18
lar coverage restrictions, affecting individuals of re-
19
productive age in the United States who are insured 
20
through the Medicaid program, as well as individuals 
21
who receive insurance or care through other Federal 
22
health plans and programs. Of women aged 15 to 44 
23
enrolled in Medicaid in 2017, 55 percent lived in the 
24
35 States and the District of Columbia that do not 
25
20:42 Jun 23, 2022
H7585
844 
•HR 7585 IH
cover abortion, except in limited circumstances. This 
1
amounts to roughly 7,300,000 women of reproduc-
2
tive age, including 3,100,000 women living below the 
3
Federal poverty level. Women of color are dispropor-
4
tionately likely to be insured by the Medicaid pro-
5
gram, and nationwide, 32 percent of Black women 
6
and 27 percent of Hispanic women aged 15 to 44 
7
were enrolled in Medicaid in 2017, compared with 
8
16 percent of White women. 
9
(6) Abortion-specific restrictions are even more 
10
compounded by the ongoing criminalization of people 
11
who are pregnant, including those who are incarcer-
12
ated, living with HIV, or with substance-use dis-
13
orders. These communities already experience health 
14
inequities due to social, political, and environmental 
15
inequities, and restrictions on abortion services exac-
16
erbate these harms. Removing medically unjustified 
17
restrictions on abortion services would constitute one 
18
important step on the path toward realizing repro-
19
ductive justice by ensuring that the full range of re-
20
productive health care is accessible to all who need 
21
it. 
22
(7) Abortion-specific restrictions are a tool of 
23
gender oppression, as they target health care serv-
24
ices that are used primarily by individuals with re-
25
20:42 Jun 23, 2022
H7585
845 
•HR 7585 IH
productive needs. These paternalistic restrictions 
1
rely on and reinforce harmful stereotypes about gen-
2
der roles, people’s decision making, and people’s 
3
need for protection instead of support, undermining 
4
their ability to control their own lives and well-being. 
5
These restrictions harm the basic autonomy, dignity, 
6
and equality of individuals with reproductive health 
7
needs, and their ability to participate in the social 
8
and economic life of the Nation. 
9
(8) Many abortion-specific restrictions do not 
10
confer any health or safety benefits on the patient. 
11
Instead, these restrictions have the purpose and ef-
12
fect of unduly burdening people’s personal and pri-
13
vate medical decisions to end their pregnancies by 
14
making access to abortion services more difficult, 
15
invasive, and costly, often forcing people to travel 
16
significant distances and make multiple unnecessary 
17
visits to the provider, and in some cases, foreclosing 
18
the option altogether. 
19
(9) Congress has used its authority in the past 
20
to protect access to abortion services and health care 
21
providers’ ability to provide abortion services. In the 
22
early 1990s, protests and blockades at health care 
23
facilities where abortion services were provided, and 
24
associated violence, increased dramatically and 
25
20:42 Jun 23, 2022
H7585
846 
•HR 7585 IH
reached crisis level, requiring congressional action. 
1
Congress passed the Freedom of Access to Clinic 
2
Entrances Act (Public Law 103–259; 108 Stat. 694) 
3
to address that situation and protect physical access 
4
to abortion services. 
5
(10) Congressional action is necessary to put an 
6
end to harmful restrictions, to federally protect ac-
7
cess to abortion services for everyone regardless of 
8
where they live, and to protect the ability of health 
9
care providers to provide these services in a safe and 
10
accessible manner. 
11
(11) The Equal Access to Abortion Coverage in 
12
Health Insurance Act of 2021 or the EACH Act of 
13
2021 (H.R. 2234, S. 1021) introduced in the 117th 
14
Congress, would reverse the Hyde amendment and 
15
related abortion coverage restrictions. It would cre-
16
ate an enforceable statutory right for people who re-
17
ceive health coverage or care through enumerated 
18
Federal programs (including Medicaid, the Chil-
19
dren’s Health Insurance Program, Medicare, the In-
20
dian Health Service, among others) and plans (in-
21
cluding government-sponsored health insurance due 
22
to a current or former employment relationship) to 
23
receive abortion coverage. It would require the Fed-
24
eral government to facilitate abortion access for indi-

•HR 7585 IH
viduals eligible to receive health care in Federal fa-
1
cilities or in facilitates with which it contracts to 
2
provide health care, such as immigration detention 
3
centers. It also prohibits the Federal Government 
4
from prohibiting, restricting, or otherwise inhibiting 
5
State or local governments or private health insur-
6
ance issuers from providing abortion coverage. 
7
(12) The Women’s Health Protection Act of 
8
2021 (H.R. 3755, S. 1975) introduced in the 117th 
9
Congress, would establish an enforceable statutory 
10
right for health care providers to provide, and abor-
11
tion patients to receive, abortions free from medi-
12
cally unnecessary restrictions, limitations, and bans 
13
that delay, and at times, completely obstruct, access

SEC. 6001. MENTAL HEALTH FINDINGS. 
19
Congress finds the following: 
20
(1) Despite the existence of effective treat-
21
ments, inequities lie in the availability, accessibility, 
22
and quality of mental health services for racial and 
23
ethnic minorities and people with disabilities. 
24
20:42 Jun 23, 2022
H7585
1015 
•HR 7585 IH
(2) These inequities have powerful significance 
1
for minority groups and for society as a whole. 
2
(3) Racial and ethnic minorities bear a greater 
3
burden from unmet mental health needs and thus 
4
suffer a greater loss to their overall health and pro-
5
ductivity. 
6
(4) Improving community conditions and one’s 
7
home environment, paired with high-quality, acces-
8
sible, and culturally and linguistically tailored men-
9
tal health services, can reduce the likelihood, fre-
10
quency, and intensity of challenges to one’s mental 
11
health. 
12
(5) The presence of strong social connections 
13
and trust, opportunities to experience and share cul-
14
tural identity, safe gathering places, and economic 
15
opportunity are community factors that benefit men-
16
tal health. 
17
(6) The social, physical, economic, and other 
18
conditions, otherwise known as social determinants 
19
of health, in communities can have tremendous in-
20
fluence on daily stressors that shape mental health 
21
outcomes. 
22
(7) Significant barriers include the cost of and 
23
access to quality care, societal stigma, mental health 
24
workforce shortages, the fragmented organization of 
25

1016 
•HR 7585 IH
services and needed social supports, and the history 
1
of racism and discrimination in the mental health 
2
system. 
3
(8) People with severe and persistent mental ill-
4
ness who are racial or ethnic minorities often have 
5
co-occurring health and mental health conditions 
6
and experience direct inequities in access to nec-
7
essary supports, resources, and services which, with-
8
out proper accommodations and support, further 
9
stigmatize them and limit their participation in soci-
10
ety. 
11
(9) African-American, Latinx, Asian American, 
12
Pacific Islander, Native, Middle Eastern and North 
13
African (MENA), and other people of color commu-
14
nities are more likely to experience systemic dis-
15
crimination by health care and social service pro-
16
viders and may be reluctant to seek mental health 
17
care and other health interventions. 
18
(10) Mental health conditions and substance 
19
abuse disorders retain considerable stigma in many 
20
communities of color and seeking treatment is not 
21
always encouraged. 
22
(11) Addressing mental health stigma and in-
23
creasing access to culturally and linguistically appro-
24
priate treatments and supports in communities will

help to increase utilization of mental health services 
1
for people who have functional difficulties because of 
2
mental health challenges. 
3
(12) There is a link between a mental health di-
4
agnosis and the likelihood of an individual commit-
5
ting suicide. 
6
(13) A comprehensive public health approach to 
7
behavioral health is one that fosters and finances 
8
protective factors in racial and ethnic communities 
9
that support mental health. 
10
(14) Approaches to mental health and trauma 
11
must keep in mind the historical and present day 
12
and cultural trauma that impacts many communities 
13
of color, including trauma and loss caused by ad-
14
verse weather events and structural violence. 
15
(15) Culturally and linguistically appropriate 
16
treatments and supports must keep approaches of 
17
individual communities to mental health in mind, in-
18
cluding by considering— 
19
(A) approaches to cultural healing prac-
20
tices; and 
21
(B) the diverse mental health professionals 
22
needed for such practices, such as peer support

(16) Approaches to mental health and address-

2
intersectionality of individuals; that individuals may 
3
experience many inequities that shape the way they 
4
process and experience everyday life. 
5
SEC. 6002. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
6
It is the sense of the Congress that it is imperative 
7
that a comprehensive public health approach to addressing

trauma and mental health care be focused on care delivery

that is culturally and linguistically appropriate.

IMPACT MINORITY DISEASES

Subtitle A—Cancer 
3
SEC. 7001. LUNG CANCER MORTALITY REDUCTION. 
4
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following find-
5
ings: 
6
(1) Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer 
7
death for both men and women, accounting for 25 
8
percent of all cancer deaths. 
9
(2) Since the National Cancer Act of 1971 
10
(Public Law 92–218; 85 Stat. 778), coordinated and 
11
comprehensive research has raised the 5-year sur-
12
vival rates for breast cancer to 90 percent, for pros-
13
tate cancer to 99 percent, and for colon cancer to 
14
64 percent. 
15
(3) The 5-year survival rate for lung cancer is 
16
still only 18 percent, and a similar coordinated and 
17
comprehensive research effort is required to achieve 
18
increases in lung cancer survivability rates. 
19
(4) Sixty percent of lung cancer cases are now 
20
diagnosed in nonsmokers or former smokers. 
21
(5) Two-thirds of nonsmokers diagnosed with 
22
lung cancer are women. 
23
(6) Certain minority populations, such as Afri-
24
can-American males, have disproportionately high 
25
20:42 Jun 23, 2022
H7585
1178 
•HR 7585 IH
rates of lung cancer incidence and mortality, despite 
1
their smoking rate being similar to other racial 
2
groups. 
3
(7) Members of the Baby Boomer Generation 
4
are entering their 60s, the most common age at 
5
which people develop lung cancer. 
6
(8) Tobacco addiction and exposure to other 
7
lung cancer carcinogens such as Agent Orange and 
8
other herbicides and battlefield emissions are serious 
9
problems among military personnel and war vet-
10
erans. 
11
(9) Significant and rapid improvements in lung 
12
cancer mortality can be expected through greater 
13
use and access to lung cancer screening tests for at- 
14
risk individuals. 
15
(10) Recent research has shown that screening 
16
with low-dose computed tomography scan reduced 
17
lung cancer death mortality by 20 percent for those 
18
with a high risk of lung cancer through early detec-
19
tion. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 
20
supports annual lung cancer screening for high-risk 
21
patients with low-dose computed tomography. 
22
(11) Additional strategies are necessary to fur-
23
ther enhance the existing tests and therapies avail-
24
able to diagnose and treat lung cancer in the future.

•HR 7585 IH
(12) The August 2001 Report of the Lung 
1
Cancer Progress Review Group of the National Can-
2
cer Institute stated that funding for lung cancer re-
3
search was ‘‘far below the levels characterized for 
4
other common malignancies and far out of propor-
5
tion to its massive health impact’’. 
6
(13) The Report of the Lung Cancer Progress 
7
Review Group identified as its ‘‘highest priority’’ the 
8
creation of integrated, multidisciplinary, multi-insti-
9
tutional research consortia organized around the 
10
problem of lung cancer rather than around specific 
11
research disciplines. 
12
(14) The United States must enhance its re-
13
sponse to the issues raised in the Report of the 
14
Lung Cancer Progress Review Group, and this can 
15
be accomplished through the establishment of a co-
16
ordinated effort designed to reduce the lung cancer

mortality rate by 50 percent by 2020 and targeted

SEC. 7002. EXPANDING PROSTATE CANCER RESEARCH,

OUTREACH, SCREENING, TESTING, ACCESS,

AND TREATMENT EFFECTIVENESS. 
10
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following find-
11
ings: 
12
(1) Prostate cancer is the second leading cause 
13
of cancer death among men. 
14
(2) In 2020, an estimated 191,930 individuals 
15
in the United States will be diagnosed with prostate 
16
cancer and approximately 33,330 will die from the 
17
disease. 
18
(3) Roughly 2,000,000 to 3,000,000 people in 
19
the United States are living with a diagnosis of pros-
20
tate cancer and its consequences. 
21
(4) Although prostate cancer generally affects 
22
older individuals, younger men are also at risk for 
23
the disease, and when prostate cancer appears in 
24

early middle age, it frequently takes on a more ag-
1
gressive form. 
2
(5) There are significant racial and ethnic dis-
3
parities that demand attention, for example, African 
4
Americans have prostate cancer mortality rates that 
5
are more than double those in the White population. 
6
(6) Underserved rural populations have higher 
7
rates of mortality compared to their urban counter-
8
parts, and innovative and cost-efficient methods to 
9
improve rural access to high-quality care should take 
10
advantage of advances in telehealth to diagnose and 
11
treat prostate cancer when appropriate. 
12
(7) Certain populations of veterans may have 
13
nearly twice the incidence of prostate cancer as the 
14
general population of the United States. 
15
(8) Urologists may constitute the specialists 
16
who diagnose and treat the vast majority of prostate 
17
cancer patients. 
18
(9) Although much basic and translational re-
19
search has been completed and much is currently 
20
known, there are still many unanswered questions, 
21
such as the extent to which known disparities are at-
22
tributable to disease etiology, access to care, or edu-
23
cation and awareness in the community.

•HR 7585 IH
(10) Causes of prostate cancer are not known. 
1
There is not good information regarding how to dif-
2
ferentiate accurately, early on, between aggressive 
3
and indolent forms of the disease. As a result, there 
4
is significant overtreatment in prostate cancer. 
5
There are no treatments that can durably arrest 
6
growth or cure prostate cancer once it has metasta-
7
sized. 
8
(11) A significant proportion of cases may be 
9
clinically indolent and ‘‘overdiagnosed’’, resulting in 
10
significant overtreatment. More accurate tests will 
11
allow men and their families to face less physical, 
12
psychological, financial, and emotional trauma, and 
13
billions of dollars could be saved in private and pub-
14
lic health care systems. 
15
(12) Prostate cancer research and health care 
16
programs across Federal agencies should be coordi-
17
nated to improve accountability and actively encour-
18
age the translation of research into practice and to 
19
identify and implement best practices in order to

foster an integrated and consistent focus on effective

18
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following find-
19
ings: 
20
(1) Prostate cancer has reached epidemic pro-
21
portions, particularly among African-American men, 
22
and strikes and kills men in numbers comparable to 
23
the number of women who lose their lives from 
24
breast cancer. 
25
20:42 Jun 23, 2022
H7585
1206 
•HR 7585 IH
(2) Life-saving breakthroughs in screening, di-
1
agnosis, and treatment of breast cancer resulted 
2
from the development of advanced imaging tech-
3
nologies led by the Federal Government. 
4
(3) Men should have accurate and affordable 
5
prostate cancer screening exams and minimally 
6
invasive treatment tools, similar to what women have 
7
for breast cancer. 
8
(4) While it is important for men to take ad-
9
vantage of current prostate cancer screening tech-
10
niques, a recent NCI-funded study demonstrated 
11
that the most common available methods of detect-
12
ing prostate cancer (PSA blood test and physical 
13
exams) are not foolproof, causing numerous false 
14
alarms and false reassurances. 
15
(5) The absence of advanced imaging tech-
16
nologies for prostate cancer causes the lack of accu-
17
rate information critical for clinical decisions, result-
18
ing in missed cancers and lost lives, as well as un-
19
necessary and costly medical procedures, with re-
20
lated complications. 
21
(6) With prostate imaging tools, men and their 
22
families would face less physical, psychological, fi-
23
nancial, and emotional trauma and billions of dollars

AND PREVENTION.

(a) SHORT TITLE.—This section may be cited as the 
9
‘‘Viral Hepatitis and Liver Cancer Control and Prevention 
10
Act of 2022’’. 
11
(b) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
12
(1) In the United States, nearly 5,000,000 per-
13
sons are living with the hepatitis B virus (referred 
14
to in this section as ‘‘HBV’’) or the hepatitis C virus 
15
(referred to in this section as ‘‘HCV’’). 
16
(2) The Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
17
vention (referred to in this section as the ‘‘CDC’’), 
18
has recognized HCV as the Nation’s most common 
19
chronic bloodborne virus infection and HBV as the 
20
deadliest vaccine-preventable disease. 
21
(3) HBV is transmitted through contact with 
22
infectious blood, semen, or other bodily fluids and is 
23
100 times more infectious than HIV. HCV is trans-
24
mitted by contact with infectious blood, particularly 
25
20:42 Jun 23, 2022
H7585
1233 
•HR 7585 IH
through percutaneous exposures (such as puncture 
1
through the skin). 
2
(4) In the United States, chronic HBV and 
3
HCV are the most common causes of liver cancer, 
4
the second deadliest and fastest growing cancer in 
5
this country. These viruses are the most common 
6
cause of chronic liver disease, liver cirrhosis, and the 
7
most common indications for liver transplantation. 
8
In 2019, nearly 16,000 deaths per year in the 
9
United States were attributed to chronic HBV and 
10
HCV. Chronic HCV is also a leading cause of death 
11
in Americans living with HIV/AIDS, many of those 
12
living with HIV/AIDS are coinfected with chronic 
13
HBV, chronic HCV, or both. 
14
(5) The CDC estimates that in 2019, 57,500 
15
people in the United States were newly infected with 
16
HCV and 20,700 people in the United States were 
17
newly infected with HBV. These estimates could be 
18
much higher due to many reasons, including lack of 
19
screening education and awareness, and perceived 
20
marginalization of the populations at risk. 
21
(6) The CDC reported a 374 percent increase 
22
in hepatitis C cases from 2010 to 2017, stemming 
23
from the opioid, heroin, and overdose epidemics af-
24
fecting communities nationwide. From 2014 to 
25
20:42 Jun 23, 2022
H7585
1234 
•HR 7585 IH
2015, the number of reported cases of acute hepa-
1
titis B infection in the United States rose for the 
2
first time since 2006, increasing by 20.7 percent, 
3
which is also largely attributable to the opioid epi-
4
demic. 
5
(7) HBV and HCV disproportionately affect 
6
certain populations in the United States. Although 
7
representing only about 6 percent of the population, 
8
Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders account for 
9
half of all chronic HBV cases in the United States. 
10
Baby boomers (those born between 1945 and 1965) 
11
account for approximately 75 percent of domestic 
12
chronic HCV cases. In addition, African Americans, 
13
Latinos, and American Indian and Native Alaskans 
14
are among the groups which have disproportionately 
15
high rates of HBV or HCV infections in the United 
16
States. 
17
(8) Liver cancer is a leading cause of cancer 
18
death among the Asian American and Pacific Is-
19
lander community. Asian and Pacific Islander men 
20
and women are more than twice as likely to develop 
21
liver cancer compared to the non-Hispanic White 
22
population. The higher incidence rate of liver cancer 
23
is partially explained by higher incidence rates of 
24
hepatitis B and diabetes, which are comorbidities 
25

H7585
1235 
•HR 7585 IH
shown to increase an individual’s risk of developing 
1
liver cancer. 
2
(9) Chronic HBV and chronic HCV usually do 
3
not cause symptoms early in the course of the dis-
4
ease, but after many years of a clinically ‘‘silent’’ 
5
phase, CDC estimates show more than 33 percent of 
6
infected individuals will develop cirrhosis, end-stage 
7
liver disease, or liver cancer. Since most individuals 
8
with chronic HBV, HCV, or both are unaware of 
9
their infection, they do not know to take precautions 
10
to prevent the spread of their infection and can un-
11
knowingly exacerbate their own disease progression. 
12
For those chronically infected with HBV or HCV, 
13
regular monitoring can lead to the early detection of 
14
liver cancer at a stage where a treatment is still pos-
15
sible. 
16
(10) For both chronic HBV and chronic HCV, 
17
behavioral changes and appropriate medical care can 
18
slow disease progression if diagnosis is made early. 
19
Early diagnosis, which is determined through simple 
20
blood tests, can reduce the risk of transmission and 
21
disease progression through education and vaccina-
22
tion of household members and other susceptible 
23
persons at risk. 
24
20:42 Jun 23, 2022
H7585
1236 
•HR 7585 IH
(11) Treatment for chronic HCV can eradicate 
1
the disease in approximately 90 percent of those cur-
2
rently treated. While there is no cure for chronic 
3
HBV, available treatments can effectively suppress 
4
viral replication in the overwhelming majority of 
5
those treated, thereby reducing the risk of trans-
6
mission and progression to liver scarring or liver 
7
cancer. 
8
(12) The annual health care costs attributable 
9
to HBV and HCV in the United States are signifi-
10
cant. For HBV, it is estimated to be approximately 
11
$2,500,000,000 ($2,000 per infected person). In 
12
2000, the lifetime cost of HBV, before the avail-
13
ability of most current therapies, was approximately 
14
$80,000 per chronically infected person, totaling 
15
more than $100,000,000,000. For HCV, medical 
16
costs for patients are expected to increase from 
17
$30,000,000,000 in 2009 to over $85,000,000,000 
18
in 2024. Avoiding these costs by screening and diag-
19
nosing individuals earlier, and connecting them to 
20
appropriate treatment and care, will save lives and 
21
critical health care dollars. Currently, without a 
22
comprehensive screening, testing, and diagnosis pro-
23
gram, most patients are diagnosed too late when 
24
they need a liver transplant costing at least 
25
20:42 Jun 23, 2022
H7585
1237 
•HR 7585 IH
$314,000 for uncomplicated cases or when they have 
1
liver cancer or end-stage liver disease which costs 
2
$30,980 to $110,576 per hospital admission. As 
3
health care costs continue to grow, it is critical that 
4
the Federal Government invests in effective mecha-
5
nisms to avoid documented cost drivers. 
6
(13) In 2021, the Department of Health and 
7
Human Services released its ‘‘Viral Hepatitis Na-
8
tional Strategic Plan: A Roadmap for Elimination 
9
for the United States, 2021–2025’’ (referred to in 
10
this section as the ‘‘HHS Strategic Plan’’). In 
11
March 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, 
12
Engineering, and Medicine released a report enti-
13
tled, ‘‘A National Strategy for the Elimination of 
14
Hepatitis B and C: Phase Two Report’’ (referred to 
15
in this section as the ‘‘NAS report’’), recommending 
16
specific actions to eliminate viral hepatitis as public 
17
health problems in the United States by 2030. 
18
(14) According to the NAS report, chronic 
19
HBV and HCV infections cause substantial mor-
20
bidity and mortality despite being preventable and 
21
treatable. Deficiencies in the implementation of es-
22
tablished guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, 
23
and medical management of chronic HBV and HCV 
24
infections perpetuate personal and economic bur-

dens. Existing grants are not sufficient for the scale 
1
of the health burden presented by HBV and HCV. 
2
(15) Screening and testing for HBV and HCV 
3
is aligned with the goals of Healthy People 2030 to 
4
increase immunization rates, reduce rates of infec-
5
tious diseases, and improve health for people with 
6
chronic infections. Awareness of disease and access 
7
to prevention and treatment remain essential compo-
8
nents for reducing infectious disease transmission. 
9
(16) Federal support is necessary to increase 
10
knowledge and awareness of HBV and HCV and to 
11
assist State and local prevention and control efforts 
12
in reducing the morbidity and mortality of these 
13
epidemics.

15
ices has the discretion to carry out this section (in-
16
cluding the amendments made by this section) di-
17
rectly and through whichever of the agencies of the

‘‘Bone Marrow Failure Disease Research and Treatment

Act of 2020’’. 
20
(b) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds the following: 
21
(1) Between 20,000 and 30,000 people in the 
22
United States are diagnosed each year with 
23
myelodysplastic syndromes, aplastic anemia, parox-

•HR 7585 IH
ysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, and other acquired 
1
bone marrow failure diseases. 
2
(2) Acquired bone marrow failure diseases have 
3
a debilitating and often fatal impact on those diag-
4
nosed with these diseases. 
5
(3) While some treatments for acquired bone 
6
marrow failure diseases can prolong and improve the 
7
quality of patients’ lives, there is no single cure for 
8
these diseases. 
9
(4) The prevalence of acquired bone marrow 
10
failure diseases in the United States will continue to 
11
grow as the general public ages. 
12
(5) Evidence exists suggesting that acquired 
13
bone marrow failure diseases occur more often in 
14
minority populations, particularly in Asian-American 
15
and Latino or Hispanic populations. 
16
(6) The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Insti-
17
tute and the National Cancer Institute have con-
18
ducted important research into the causes of and 
19
treatments for acquired bone marrow failure dis-
20
eases. 
21
(7) The National Marrow Donor Program Reg-
22
istry has made significant contributions to the fight 
23
against bone marrow failure diseases by connecting 
24
20:42 Jun 23, 2022

millions of potential marrow donors with individuals 
1
and families suffering from these conditions. 
2
(8) Despite these advances, a more comprehen-
3
sive Federal strategic effort among numerous Fed-
4
eral agencies is needed to discover a cure for ac-
5
quired bone marrow failure disorders. 
6
(9) Greater Federal surveillance of acquired 
7
bone marrow failure diseases is needed to gain a bet-
8
ter understanding of the causes of acquired bone 
9
marrow failure diseases. 
10
(10) The Federal Government should increase 
11
its research support for and engage with public and 
12
private organizations in developing a comprehensive 
13
approach to combat and cure acquired bone marrow 
14
failure diseases.

impede access to prevention, treatment, and care for 
5
people living with HIV or disproportionately im-
6
pacted by HIV; 
7
(4) accelerate research for more efficacious HIV

persons living with HIV. 
12
SEC. 7202. FINDINGS. 
13
The Congress finds the following: 
14
(1) Over 1,100,000 people are estimated to be 
15
living with HIV in the United States according to 
16
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 14 
17
percent of whom are unaware they are living with 
18
HIV. 
19
(2) The Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
20
vention estimates that, in 2019, there were approxi-
21
mately 34,800 people newly diagnosed with HIV. 
22
New HIV infections declined 8 percent from 37,800 
23
in 2015, after a period of general stability. From 
24
2015 to 2019, new infections among young gay and 
25
20:42 Jun 23, 2022
H7585
1300 
•HR 7585 IH
bisexual men (ages 13 to 24) dropped 33 percent 
1
overall, with declines in young men of all races, but 
2
African Americans, Hispanics, and Latinos continue 
3
to be severely and disproportionately affected. 
4
(3) HIV disproportionately affects certain popu-
5
lations in the United States. Though Blacks/African 
6
Americans represent approximately 13 percent of 
7
the population, they account for almost half (44 per-
8
cent) of all people living with HIV in the United 
9
States. Black/African-American men who have sex 
10
with men account for 26 percent of all new HIV in-
11
fections and have remained stable from 2010 to 
12
2019. 
13
(4) Disparities continue to exist among Latinos 
14
and Hispanics; in 2019, Latinos and Hispanics 
15
made up 18 percent of the United States population 
16
and 30 percent of new infections. 
17
(5) Though the rate of new infections among 
18
American Indians and Alaska Natives (referred to in 
19
this section as ‘‘AI/AN’’) is proportional to their 
20
population size, from 2015 to 2019, the annual 
21
number of HIV diagnoses increased among Amer-
22
ican Indians and Alaska Natives. 
23
(6) Asian Americans account for about 2 per-
24
cent of new HIV infections, but in 2013, 22 percent 
25

H7585

•HR 7585 IH
were undiagnosed, the highest rate of undiagnosed 
1
HIV among any race or ethnicity. Between 2010 
2
and 2016, the number of Asian Americans receiving 
3
an HIV diagnosis increased by 42 percent. 
4
(7) The latest data from the Centers for Dis-
5
ease Control and Prevention indicates that new in-
6
fections among women remained stable for women in 
7
2019. 
8
(8) The history of HIV shows that culturally 
9
relevant and gender-responsive supportive services, 
10
including psychosocial support, treatment literacy, 
11
case management, and transportation are necessary 
12
strategies to reach and engage women and girls in 
13
medical care. 
14
(9) From 2015 through 2019 in the United 
15
States and 6 dependent areas, the number of diag-
16
noses of HIV infection for transgender adults and 
17
adolescents increased. In 2019, among transgender 
18
adults and adolescents, the largest percentage (93 
19
percent) of diagnoses of HIV infections was for 
20
transgender male-to-female (MTF) people. By age, 
21
in 2019, the largest percentage (24 percent) of diag-
22
noses of HIV infection among transgender persons 
23
was for transgender MTF adults and adolescents 
24
aged 20 to 24 years, followed by transgender MTF 
25

1302 
•HR 7585 IH
adults and adolescents aged 25 to 29 years (23 per-
1
cent). 
2
(10) Stigma and discrimination contribute to 
3
such disparities. 
4
(11) The Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
5
vention has determined that increasing the propor-
6
tion of people who know their HIV status is an es-
7
sential component of comprehensive HIV treatment 
8
and prevention efforts and that early diagnosis is 
9
critical in order for people with HIV to receive life- 
10
extending therapy. Additionally, the Centers for Dis-
11
ease Control and Prevention recommend routine 
12
HIV screening in health care settings for all patients 
13
aged 13 to 64, regardless of risk. 
14
(12) In 1998, Congress created the National 
15
Minority AIDS Initiative to provide technical assist-
16
ance, build capacity, and strengthen outreach efforts 
17
among local institutions and community-based orga-
18
nizations that serve racial and ethnic minorities liv-
19
ing with or vulnerable to HIV. 
20
(13) To combat the HIV epidemic in the United 
21
States, the National HIV/AIDS Strategy (referred 
22
to in this section as ‘‘NHAS’’) provides a framework 
23
of increasing access to care, reducing new infections, 
24
and eliminating HIV-related health disparities. The 
25
20:42 Jun 23, 2022
H7585
1303 
•HR 7585 IH
vision of NHAS is ‘‘The United States will be a 
1
place where new HIV infections are prevented, every 
2
person knows their status, and every person with 
3
HIV has high-quality care and treatment, lives free 
4
from stigma and discrimination, and can achieve 
5
their full potential for health and well-being across 
6
the lifespan. This vision includes all people, regard-
7
less of age, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, 
8
race, ethnicity, religion, disability, geographic loca-
9
tion, or socioeconomic circumstance.’’. 
10
(14) In January 2019, the Department of 
11
Health and Human Services began implementing the 
12
initiative ‘‘Ending the HIV Epidemic: A Plan for 
13
America’’. The initiative seeks to reduce the number 
14
of new HIV infections in the United States by 75 
15
percent by 2025, and then by at least 90 percent by 
16
2030, for an estimated 250,000 total HIV infection 
17
averted. 
18
(15) At present, many States and United 
19
States territories have criminal statutes based on 
20
‘‘exposure’’ to HIV. Most of these laws were adopted 
21
before the availability of effective antiretroviral 
22
treatment for HIV/AIDS. 
23
(16) Research shows that stable housing leads 
24
to better health outcomes for those living with HIV. 
25
20:42 Jun 23, 2022
H7585
1304 
•HR 7585 IH
Inadequate or unstable housing is not only a barrier 
1
to effective treatment, but also increases the likeli-
2
hood of engaging in risky behaviors leading to HIV 
3
infection. Insecure housing puts people with HIV/ 
4
AIDS at risk of premature death from exposure to 
5
other diseases, poor nutrition, and lack of medical 
6
care. 
7
(17) Due to advances in treatment, many peo-
8
ple living with HIV today are living healthy lives and 
9
have the ability and desire to fully participate in all 
10
aspects of community life, including employment. 
11
Research associates being employed with tremendous 
12
economic, social, and health benefits for many people 
13
living with HIV. 
14
(18) Despite the tremendous progress made in 
15
the treatment and prevention of HIV/AIDS, dis-
16
criminatory policies stemming from continued stig-
17
matization of HIV/AIDS and the LGBTQ+ commu-
18
nity continue to plague the scientific community. 
19
This includes blood donation guidance updated by 
20
Food and Drug Administration in 2020 that rec-
21
ommends a 3-month deferral policy for gay and bi-
22
sexual men before they are eligible to donate blood.

Health agencies in the United States must imple-

science and that do not unfairly single out any 
1
group of individuals. 
2
(19) The common benefits associated with em-
3
ployment include income, autonomy, productivity, 
4
and status within society, daily structure, making a 
5
contribution to one’s community, and increased skills 
6
and self-esteem. Research also indicates that many 
7
people with disabilities, including people living with 
8
HIV, report perceiving themselves as being less dis-
9
abled or not disabled at all, when working. Further-
10
more, some studies link working with better physical 
11
and mental health outcomes for people living with 
12
HIV when compared to those who are not working. 
13
Preliminary data also suggest that transitioning to 
14
employment is associated with reduced HIV-related 
15
health risk behavior for many people. 
16
(20) In July 2012, the Food and Drug Admin-
17
istration approved the first drug to be used as pre- 
18
exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). PrEP reduces the risk 
19
of HIV infection in HIV-negative individuals. Stud-
20
ies have shown that PrEP reduces HIV transmission 
21
from sex by about 99 percent when taken consist-
22
ently. Despite increases in PrEP uptake, PrEP use 
23
remains low among gay and bisexual men of color. 
24
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
25
20:42 Jun 23, 2022
H7585
1306 
•HR 7585 IH
found that uptake was lower among African-Amer-
1
ican (26 percent) and Latino (30 percent) men com-
2
pared with White men (42 percent). Similarly, PrEP 
3
awareness was lower among African-American (86 
4
percent) and Latino (87 percent) men compared 
5
with White men (95 percent). While clinical research 
6
on transgender populations and PrEP is currently 
7
limited, the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
8
tion recommends PrEP use in transgender popu-
9
lations. In September 2019, the Food and Drug Ad-
10
ministration approved the second drug to be used as 
11
PrEP. 
12
(21) Syringe service programs have been associ-
13
ated with lowered HIV infections, lower hepatitis C 
14
infections, and increased linkage to substance use 
15
treatment. 
16
(22) There is now conclusive scientific evidence 
17
that a person living with HIV who is on 
18
antiretroviral therapy and is durably virally sup-
19
pressed (defined as having a consistent viral load of 
20
less than 200 copies/ml) does not sexually transmit 
21
HIV. The conclusive evidence about the highly effec-
22
tive preventative benefits of antiretroviral therapy

provides an unprecedented opportunity to improve

SEC. 7215. REVIEW OF ALL FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS, 
17
18
THE CRIMINAL PROSECUTION OF INDIVID-
19
UALS FOR HIV-RELATED OFFENSES. 
20
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following find-
21
ings: 
22
(1) At present, 32 States and 2 United States 
23
territories have criminal statutes based on perceived 
24
exposure to HIV, rather than behaviors motivated by 
25
20:42 Jun 23, 2022
H7585
1329 
•HR 7585 IH
an intent to harm, presenting a significant risk of 
1
transmission and resulting in actual transmission of 
2
HIV to another. 11 States have HIV-specific laws 
3
that make spitting or biting a felony, even though it 
4
is not possible to transmit HIV via saliva. 24 States 
5
require persons who are aware that they have HIV 
6
to disclose their status to sexual partners, regardless 
7
of whether they are noninfectious. 14 of these 24 
8
States also require disclosure to needle-sharing part-
9
ners. 25 States criminalize 1 or more behaviors that 
10
pose a low or negligible risk for HIV transmission. 
11
(2) HIV-specific criminal laws are classified as 
12
felonies in 28 States. In 3 States, a person’s expo-
13
sure to another to HIV does not subject the person 
14
to criminal prosecution for that act alone but may 
15
result in a sentence enhancement. 18 States impose 
16
sentences of up to 10 years per violation, 7 States 
17
impose sentences between 11 and 20 years, and 5 
18
States impose sentences of greater than 20 years. 
19
(3) When members of the Armed Forces ac-
20
quire HIV, they are issued orders that require them 
21
to disclose and use a condom under all cir-
22
cumstances including when the known risk of trans-
23
mission is 0. Failure to disclose can result in pros-
24
20:42 Jun 23, 2022
H7585
1330 
•HR 7585 IH
ecution under the Uniform Code of Military Justice 
1
(UCMJ). 
2
(4) The number of prosecutions, arrests, and 
3
instances where HIV-based charges are used to in-
4
duce plea agreements is unknown. Because State- 
5
level prosecution and arrest data are not readily 
6
available in any national legal database, the societal 
7
impact of these laws may be underestimated and 
8
most cases that go to trial are not reduced to writ-
9
ten, published opinions. 
10
(5) State and Federal criminal law does not 
11
currently reflect the 4 decades of medical advances 
12
and discoveries made with regard to transmission 
13
and treatment of HIV/AIDS. 
14
(6) According to the CDC, correct and con-
15
sistent male or female condom use, or adherence to 
16
a preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) regimen that re-
17
sults in viral suppression, are very effective in pre-
18
venting HIV transmission. However, most State 
19
HIV-specific laws and prosecutions do not treat the 
20
use of a condom during sexual intercourse or adher-
21
ence to PrEP as a mitigating factor or evidence that 
22
the defendant did not intend to transmit HIV. 
23
(7) Criminal laws and prosecutions do not take 
24
into account the benefits of effective antiretroviral 
25
20:42 Jun 23, 2022
H7585
1331 
•HR 7585 IH
medications, which suppress the virus to extremely 
1
low levels and further reduce the already low risk of 
2
transmitting HIV to near 0. 
3
(8) In addition to HIV-specific criminal laws, 
4
general criminal laws are often misused to prosecute 
5
people based on their HIV status. Although HIV, 
6
and even AIDS, currently is viewed as a treatable, 
7
chronic, medical condition, people living with HIV 
8
have been charged under aggravated assault, at-
9
tempted murder, and even bioterrorism statutes be-
10
cause prosecutors, courts, and legislators continue to 
11
view and characterize the blood, semen, and saliva of 
12
people living with HIV as a ‘‘deadly weapon’’. 
13
(9) Multiple peer-reviewed studies demonstrate 
14
that HIV-specific laws do not reduce risk-taking be-
15
havior or increase disclosure by people living with or 
16
at risk of HIV, and there is increasing evidence that 
17
these laws reduce the willingness to get tested. Fur-
18
thermore, placing legal responsibility for preventing 
19
the transmission of HIV and other pathogens that 
20
can be sexually transmitted exclusively on people di-
21
agnosed with a sexually transmitted infection under-
22
mines the public health message that all people are 
23
responsible for practicing behaviors that protect 
24
themselves from HIV and other sexually transmitted 
25
20:42 Jun 23, 2022
H7585
1332 
•HR 7585 IH
infections. Unfortunately, some State laws create an 
1
expectation of disclosure work against public health 
2
communication and discourage risk-reduction meas-
3
ures that could prevent transmission as a result of 
4
those who are acutely infected and unaware of their 
5
status. 
6
(10) The identity of an individual subject to an 
7
HIV-based prosecution is broadcast through media 
8
reports, potentially destroying employment opportu-
9
nities and relationships and violating the person’s 
10
right to privacy. 
11
(11) Individuals who are convicted after an 
12
HIV-based prosecution often must register as sex of-
13
fenders even in cases involving consensual sexual ac-
14
tivity. Their employability is destroyed, and their 
15
family relationships are fractured. 
16
(12) The United Nations, including the Joint 
17
United 
Nations 
Programme 
on 
HIV/AIDS 
18
(UNAIDS), urges governments to ‘‘limit criminaliza-
19
tion to cases of intentional transmission’’. This re-
20
quirement would limit prosecutions to situations 
21
‘‘where a person knows his or her HIV-positive sta-
22
tus, acts with the intention to transmit HIV, and 
23
does in fact transmit it’’. UNAIDS also recommends 
24
20:42 Jun 23, 2022
H7585
1333 
•HR 7585 IH
that criminal law should not be applied to cases 
1
where there is no significant risk of transmission. 
2
(13) In 2010, the Federal Government released 
3
the first ever National HIV/AIDS Strategy (NHAS), 
4
which addressed HIV-specific criminal laws, stating: 
5
‘‘While we understand the intent behind these laws, 
6
they may not have the desired effect and they may 
7
make people less willing to disclose their status by 
8
making people feel at even greater risk of discrimi-
9
nation. In some cases, it may be appropriate for leg-
10
islators to reconsider whether existing laws continue 
11
to further the public interest and public health. In 
12
many instances, the continued existence and enforce-
13
ment of these types of laws run counter to scientific 
14
evidence about routes of HIV transmission and may 
15
undermine the public health goals of promoting HIV 
16
screening and treatment.’’. The NHAS also states 
17
that State legislatures should consider reviewing 
18
HIV-specific criminal statutes to ensure that they 
19
are consistent with current knowledge of HIV trans-
20
mission and support public health approaches to pre-
21
venting and treating HIV. 
22
(14) The Global Commission on HIV and the 
23
Law was launched in June 2010 to examine laws 
24
and practices that criminalize people living with and 
25
20:42 Jun 23, 2022
H7585
1334 
•HR 7585 IH
vulnerable to HIV and to develop evidence-based rec-
1
ommendations for effective HIV responses. The 
2
Commission calls for ‘‘governments, civil society and 
3
international bodies to repeal punitive laws and 
4
enact laws that facilitate and enable effective re-
5
sponses to HIV prevention, care and treatment serv-
6
ices for all who need them’’. The Commission rec-
7
ommends against the enactment of ‘‘laws that ex-
8
plicitly criminalize HIV transmission, exposure or 
9
non-disclosure of HIV status, which are counter-
10
productive’’. 
11
(15) In February 2019, the Department of 
12
Health and Human Services (HHS) launched ‘‘End-
13
ing the HIV Epidemic: A Plan for America’’, a new 
14
initiative with an ambitious goal to end the domestic 
15
HIV epidemic in 10 years by reducing new cases of 
16
HIV by 75 percent by 2025 and by 90 percent by 
17
2030. In this plan, HHS notes that stigma ‘‘can be 
18
a debilitating barrier preventing people living with, 
19
or at risk for, HIV from receiving the health care, 
20
services, and respect they need and deserve’’. Many 
21
of the States and jurisdictions identified as a pri-
22
ority for the first 5 years of the plan have stigma- 
23
based criminal statutes for perceived exposure to 
24
HIV. These statutes run counter to the goals of this

SEC. 7304. CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE. 
14
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds as follows: 
15
(1) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (re-
16
ferred to in this subsection as ‘‘COPD’’) refers to 
17
chronic bronchitis and emphysema, incurable dis-
18
eases that make it difficult to exhale all the air from 
19
one’s lungs, and that can cause persistent coughing, 
20
shortness of breath, and sputum. 
21
(2) COPD exacerbations—episodes of acute dif-
22
ficulty breathing and moderate to severe fatigue— 
23
are dangerous, and their treatment often requires 
24
hospitalization. 
25
20:42 Jun 23, 2022
H7585
1425 
•HR 7585 IH
(3) While smoking is the primary risk factor for 
1
COPD, other risk factors include air pollution, occu-
2
pational exposures, heredity, a history of childhood 
3
respiratory infections, and socioeconomic status. 
4
(4) It is estimated that over 16,000,000 adults 
5
in the United States have COPD. 
6
(5) COPD is a leading cause of death in the 
7
United States, claiming over 156,000 lives in 2019. 
8
(6) Since 2000, deaths for women with COPD 
9
have exceeded deaths in men. 
10
(7) Although African Americans have a lower 
11
prevalence of COPD in the United States, research-
12
ers have shown that African Americans may be 
13
underdiagnosed. Furthermore, research has shown 
14
that African Americans develop COPD with less cu-
15
mulative smoke exposure and at a younger age.

(b) IN GENERAL.—The Director of the Centers for 
17
Disease Control and Prevention shall conduct, support,

(b) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following find-
21
ings:

(2) Disparities in TB exist and significantly im-
1
pact minority communities in the United States. The 
2
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (re-
3
ferred to in this section as ‘‘CDC’’) finds that 89

percent of people diagnosed with TB disease in 2020 
5
self-identified as racial and ethnic minorities. 
6
(3) African Americans comprised 19.6 percent 
7
of people diagnosed with TB disease during 2020. 
8
The population-adjusted rate of TB among African 
9
Americans is 1.5 times higher than the national 
10
total, and 8.0 times higher than among Whites. 
11
(4) Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and 
12
other Pacific Islanders comprised 37.4 percent of 
13
people diagnosed with TB disease during 2020. The 
14
population-adjusted rate of TB among Asian Ameri-
15
cans is 6 times higher than the national total, and

33.25 times higher than among Whites. The popu-

Hispanics and Latinos is 1.6 times higher than the

•HR 7585 IH
national total, and 8.75 times higher than among 
1
Whites. 
2
(6) TB is both preventable and curable, but the 
3
current rate of decline of TB in the United States 
4
remains too slow to achieve TB elimination in this 
5
century. 
6
(7) TB is transmitted through the air when a 
7
person who has TB disease in their lungs coughs or 
8
sneezes. People who are in close proximity to the 
9
person with TB can breathe in the TB bacteria, and 
10
the bacteria will initially settle in their lungs. Living 
11
conditions related to poverty, such as crowded hous-
12
ing and poor ventilation, can greatly increase the 
13
risk of transmission. Without proper and timely di-
14
agnosis and access to treatment, the TB bacteria 
15
may grow and spread to other parts of their body. 
16
(8) As many as 13,000,000 people in the 
17
United States may have latent TB infection (re-
18
ferred to in this section as ‘‘LTBI’’). People with 
19
LTBI have TB bacteria in their bodies, but their 
20
immune system is containing the bacteria, and they 
21
are not sick, nor do they have any current risk of 
22
spreading TB to others. LTBI can activate into in-
23
fectious, life-threatening TB if not treated. Modeling 
24
20:42 Jun 23, 2022
H7585
1431 
•HR 7585 IH
has shown that eliminating TB is not possible with-
1
out addressing LTBI. 
2
(9) Comorbidities associated with TB include 
3
cancer, diabetes mellitus, and HIV. People with 
4
these medical conditions and compromised immune 
5
systems are more likely to develop active TB disease 
6
and to have worse outcomes from TB. Many of the 
7
communities placed at highest risk of other adverse 
8
health outcomes and injustices are also dispropor-
9
tionately impacted by TB, and these include people 
10
experiencing homelessness and housing instability, 
11
people in congregate living and carceral settings, and 
12
people born outside of the United States. 
13
(10) Forms of active TB that do not show drug 
14
resistance are classified as drug-susceptible TB (re-
15
ferred to in this section as ‘‘DS–TB’’). Drug-resist-
16
ant TB (referred to in this section as ‘‘DR–TB’’) is 
17
a rising threat to the public health of the United 
18
States. DR–TB that exhibits resistance to two or 
19
more first-line drugs is referred to as multi-drug re-
20
sistant TB (referred to in this section as ‘‘MDR– 
21
TB’’). MDR–TB that also is resistant to at least 
22
one fluoroquinolone, and at least one additional

sively drug-resistant TB (referred to in this section 
1
as ‘‘XDR–TB’’). 
2
(11) Approximately 56 people in the United 
3
States were diagnosed with MDR–TB in 2020. One 
4
person was diagnosed with XDR–TB in the same 
5
year. 
6
(12) In the United States, $503,000,000 was 
7
spent in 2020 to treat TB; direct treatment costs 
8
average $20,211 to treat a patient with DS–TB, 
9
$182,186 to treat a patient with MDR–TB, and 
10
$567,708 to treat a patient with XDR–TB. When 
11
factoring in productivity losses during treatment, 
12
DS–TB averages $24,661, MDR–TB averages 
13
$347,324, and XDR–TB averages $729,039. Treat-
14
ment is often difficult, with daily complex multi-pill 
15
regimens, with side-effects ranging from hearing and 
16
vision loss to mental health issues. 
17
(13) Recognizing the public health, economic, 
18
and societal costs to the threat of MDR–TB, the 
19
National Action Plan to Combat MDR–TB was de-
20
veloped by the White House to provide the United 
21

(14) Additional Federal support is necessary to 
4
expand TB control efforts in case finding and treat-
5
ment to address LTBI in a national prevention ini-
6
tiative. Key policy and research breakthroughs in-
7
crease the success of a TB prevention initiative: the 
8
U.S. Preventative Services Task Force recommenda-
9
tion’s ‘‘B’’ rating, screening for LTBI among high- 
10
risk adults as a covered service increases the likeli-
11
hood that impacted racial and ethnic minority 
12
groups can get tested for TB; a new, shorter course 
13
treatment regimen reduces the length of treatment 
14
for LTBI from every day for 6 to 9 months to one 
15
dose per week for 12 weeks, increasing the likelihood 
16
of treatment completion; and the use of blood-based 
17
diagnostic tests, Interferon-gamma release assays or 
18
IGRAs, increases the ability to detect LTBI among 
19
patients in affected communities.

SEC. 7401. FINDINGS. 
10
Congress finds as follows: 
11
(1) Eighty percent of African-American women 
12
and nearly 74 percent of Hispanic men are either 
13
overweight or obese, speeding the onset and progres-
14
sion of knee arthritis. 
15
(2) Arthritis affects 58,500,000 people in the 
16
United States, and that number will rise to 
17
78,000,000 by the year 2040. 
18
(3) 32,500,000 people in the United States suf-
19
fer from osteoarthritis, the most common form of ar-
20
thritis, making it the leading cause of disability in 
21
the United States. Osteoarthritis is sometimes re-
22
ferred to as degenerative joint disease. 
23
(4) Obesity accelerates the onset of arthritis: 70 
24
percent of obese adults with mild osteoarthritis of 
25

•HR 7585 IH
the knee at age 60 will develop advanced end-stage 
1
disease by age 80. In contrast, just 43 percent of 
2
non-obese adults will have end-stage disease over the 
3
same time period. 
4
(5) Arthritis affects 1 in 4 people in the United 
5
States and is the single greatest cause of chronic 
6
pain and disability in the United States. 
7
(6) Women, Black Americans, and Hispanics 
8
have more severe arthritis and functional limitations. 
9
These same individuals are more likely to be obese 
10
and diabetic, and have a higher incidence of heart 
11
diseases. 
12
(7) Arthritis costs $304,000,000,000 a year, in-
13
cluding $140,000,000,000 in direct costs (medical) 
14
and $164,000,000,000 in indirect costs (lost earn-
15
ings). 
16
(8) Obesity and other chronic health conditions 
17
exacerbate the debilitating impact of arthritis, lead-
18
ing to inactivity, loss of independence, and a per-
19
petual cycle of comorbid chronic conditions. 
20
(9) Sixty-one percent of arthritis sufferers are 
21
women, and women represent 64 percent of an esti-
22
mated 43,000,000 annual visits to physicians’ offices 
23
and outpatient clinics where arthritis was the pri-
24
mary diagnosis. Women also represented 60 percent 
25

•HR 7585 IH
of approximately 1,000,000 hospitalizations that oc-
1
curred in 2003 for which arthritis was the primary 
2
diagnosis. 
3
(10) Women ages 65 and older have up to 21⁄2 
4
times more disabilities than men of the same age. 
5
Higher rates of obesity and arthritis among this 
6
group explained up to 48 percent of the gender gap 
7
in disability, above all other common chronic health 
8
conditions. 
9
(11) The primary indication for total knee 
10
arthroplasty (referred to in this section as ‘‘TKA’’), 
11
also known as knee replacement, is relief of signifi-
12
cant, disabling pain caused by severe arthritis. 
13
(12) Knee replacement is surgery for people 
14
with severe knee damage. Knee replacement can re-
15
lieve pain and allow an individual to be more active. 
16
The process for a total knee replacement involves 
17
the surgeon removing damaged cartilage and bone 
18
from the surface of the knee joint and replacing the 
19
cartilage and bone with a man-made surface of 
20
metal and plastic. In a partial knee replacement, the 
21
surgeon only replaces part of the knee joint. 
22
(13) Total hip replacement, also called total hip 
23
arthroplasty (referred to in this section as ‘‘THA’’), 
24
is used if hip pain interferes with daily activities and

more conservative treatments have not helped. Ar-
1
thritis damage is the most common reason to need 
2
hip replacement. 
3
(14) The odds of a family practice physician 
4
recommending TKA to a male patient with moderate 
5
arthritis are twice that of a female patient, while the 
6
odds of an orthopedic surgeon recommending TKA 
7
to a male patient with moderate arthritis are 22 
8
times that of a female patient. 
9
(15) Black Americans with doctor-diagnosed ar-
10
thritis have a higher prevalence of severe pain attrib-
11
utable to arthritis, compared with White Americans 
12
(34.0 percent versus 22.6 percent). Black Ameri-
13
cans, compared to White Americans, report a higher 
14
proportion of work limitations (39.5 percent versus 
15
28.0 percent) and a higher prevalence of arthritis-at-
16
tributable work limitation (6.6 percent versus 4.6 
17
percent). 
18
(16) Hispanics are 50 percent more likely than 
19
non-Hispanic Whites to report needing assistance 
20
with at least one instrumental activity of daily living 
21
and to have difficulty walking. 
22
(17) Black Americans and Hispanics were 1.3 
23
times more likely to have activity limitation, 1.6 
24
times more likely to have work limitations, and 1.9 
25
20:42 Jun 23, 2022

•HR 7585 IH
times more likely to have severe joint pain than 
1
Whites. 
2
(18) In 2003, the National Academy of Medi-
3
cine reported that the rates of TKA and THA 
4
among Black American and Hispanic patients are 
5
significantly lower than for Whites—even for those 
6
with equitable health care coverage such as through 
7
Medicare or the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
8
(19) According to the Centers for Disease Con-
9
trol and Prevention, in 2000, Black American Medi-
10
care enrollees were 37 percent less likely than White 
11
Medicare enrollees to undergo total knee replace-
12
ments. In 2006, the disparity increased to 39 per-
13
cent. 
14
(20) Even after adjusting for insurance and 
15
health access, Hispanics and Black Americans are 
16
almost 50 percent less likely to undergo total knee 
17
replacement than Whites.

(b) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
21
(1) Decrements in sleep health such as sleep 
22
apnea, insufficient sleep time, and insomnia, affect 
23
50,000,000 to 70,000,000 adults in the United 
24
States. An estimated 25,000,000 adults in the 
25

1447 
•HR 7585 IH
United States have sleep apnea, a chronic disorder 
1
characterized by one or more pauses in breathing 
2
which can last from a few seconds to minutes. They 
3
may occur 30 times or more an hour, disrupting 
4
sleep and resulting in excessive daytime sleepiness 
5
and loss in productivity. 
6
(2) Seventy percent of high school students are 
7
not getting enough sleep on school nights, while 35 
8
percent of people in the United States get fewer 
9
than 7 hours of sleep per night, and roughly 1,550 
10
fatal motor vehicle crashes are caused by drowsy 
11
drivers. 
12
(3) Insufficient sleep and insomnia are more 
13
prevalent in women. Women who are pregnant and 
14
have sleep apnea are at an increased risk of cardio-
15
vascular complications during pregnancy. The im-
16
pact of disparities in sleep health is associated with 
17
a growing number of health problems, including the 
18
following: 
19
(A) Hypertension. 
20
(B) Cancer. 
21
(C) Stroke. 
22
(D) Cardiac arrhythmia.

(F) Diabetes. 
1
(G) Cognitive functioning and behavior. 
2
(H) Depression and bipolar disorder. 
3
(I) Substance abuse. 
4
(4) A sleep disparity exists in that poor sleep 
5
quality is strongly associated with poverty, race, and 
6
social determinants of health. Factors such as em-
7
ployment, education, and health status, amongst 
8
others, significantly mediated this effect only in poor 
9
subjects, suggesting a differential vulnerability to 
10
these factors in poor relative to nonpoor individuals 
11
in the context of sleep quality. 
12
(5) Black Americans sleep worse than White 
13
Americans. Black Americans take longer to fall 
14
asleep, report poorer sleep quality, have more light 
15
and less deep sleep, and nap more often and longer. 
16
(6) Black Americans and individuals in lower 
17
socioeconomic status groups may be at an increased 
18
risk for sleep disturbances and associated health 
19
consequences. 
20
(7) Among young Black Americans, the likeli-
21
hood of having sleep disordered breathing and exhib-
22
iting risk factors for poor sleep is twice that in 
23
young White Americans. Frequent snoring is more 
24
common among Black American and Hispanic

women and Hispanic men compared to non-Hispanic 
1
White Americans, independent of other factors in-
2
cluding obesity. 
3
(8) Black Americans with sleep-disordered 
4
breathing develop symptoms at a younger age than 
5
Caucasians but appear less likely to be diagnosed 
6
and treated in a timely manner. This delay may at 
7
least in part be due to reduced access to care. 
8
(9) Sleep loss contributes to increased risk for 
9
chronic conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and hy-
10
pertension, all of which have increased prevalence in 
11
underserved, underrepresented minorities. Racial 
12
and ethnic disparities related to obesity may also 
13
contribute to disparities in health outcomes related 
14
to sleep-disordered breathing. 
15
(10) Underrepresented minorities in the United 
16
States report an insomnia rate of 12.9 percent com-
17
pared to only 6.6 percent for White Americans. 
18
(11) Black women have a higher incidence of 
19
insomnia than Black men, perhaps related in part to 
20
higher risk for chronic persisting symptoms.

ings:

(1) Kidney diseases impact 37,000,000 individ-
16
uals in the United States. 
17
(2) Black Americans comprise just 13 percent 
18
of the United States population, but 33 percent of 
19
the United States dialysis patient population. Com-
20
pared to White Americans, kidney failure prevalence 
21
is about 3.7 times greater in Black Americans, 1.4 
22
times greater in Native Americans, and 1.5 times 
23
greater in Asian Americans.

(3) Peritoneal dialysis and home hemodialysis 
1
use is 40–50 percent lower among Black Americans 
2
and Hispanics. 
3
(4) Every racial and ethnic minority group in 
4
the United States is significantly less likely to be 
5
treated with home dialysis than Whites, and demo-
6
graphic and clinical characteristics are insufficient to 
7
explain this differential use. 
8
(5) Black Americans on dialysis, irrespective of 
9
dialysis modality, and Hispanics undergoing PD or 
10
in-center HD, are significantly less likely than their 
11
White counterparts to receive a kidney transplant. 
12
(6) Black Americans, Hispanics, and Asian 
13
Americans are less likely to receive living donor kid-
14
ney transplants than Whites. Efforts to reduce dis-
15
parities in live donor kidney transplantation for 
16
Black American, Hispanic, and Asian patients with 
17
kidney failure have been largely unsuccessful.

likely to receive a preemptive transplant from a de-
20
ceased donor compared to private insurance patients 
21
(5 percent and 11 percent versus 24 percent), and

24

1
and 5 percent of Hispanic patients compared with 
2
18 percent of White patients). 
3
(8) Low-income populations are significantly 
4
more likely to progress to kidney failure. 
5
(9) Low socioeconomic status is associated with 
6
increased incidence of chronic kidney disease, pro-
7
gression to kidney failure, inadequate dialysis treat-
8
ment, and reduced access to kidney transplantation.

SEC. 9005. SENSE OF CONGRESS CONCERNING FULL FUND-
11
ING OF ACTIVITIES TO ELIMINATE RACIAL 
12
AND ETHNIC HEALTH DISPARITIES. 
13
(a) FINDINGS.—The Congress makes the following 
14
findings: 
15
(1) The health status of the population of the 
16
United States is declining, and the United States 
17
currently ranks below most industrialized nations in 
18
health status measured by longevity, sickness, and 
19
mortality. 
20
(2) Racial and ethnic minority populations tend 
21
to have the poorest health status and face substan-
22
tial cultural, social, political, and economic barriers 
23
to obtaining high-quality health care.

•HR 7585 IH
(3) Racial and ethnic minority populations ex-
1
perience and suffer from the extreme and egregious 
2
health disparities and inequities that are caused by 
3
racism, discrimination, and implicit racial and ethnic 
4
bias in and throughout the health care system. 
5
(4) Communities of color with intersecting iden-
6
tities and backgrounds, including children, older 
7
adults, women, people with disabilities, people with 
8
limited English proficiency, immigrants, lesbian, 
9
gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning 
10
populations, and people with lower incomes experi-
11
ence significant personal and structural barriers to 
12
obtaining affordable, high-quality health care. 
13
(5) Efforts to reduce and eliminate racial and 
14
ethnic health disparities and inequities, and improve 
15
minority health, have been limited by inadequate re-
16
sources (funding, staffing, and stewardship), a lack 
17
of prioritization, and a lack of accountability from 
18
the Federal Government, particularly due to stag-
19
nant or declining appropriations that are not in line 
20
with the dire need faced by communities that are 
21
impacted. 
22
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of the 
23
Congress that—

(1) health disparities negatively impact out-
1
comes for health and human security of the Nation; 
2
(2) reducing racial, ethnic, age, sexual, and 
3
gender disparities in prevention and treatment are 
4
unique civil and human rights challenges and, as 
5
such, Federal agencies and health care entities and 
6
systems receiving Federal funds should be account-
7
able for their role in causing disparities and in-
8
equity;

(3) funding for the National Institute on Mi-
10
nority Health and Health Disparities, the Office of 
11
Civil Rights in the Department of Health and 
12

15
racial and ethnic disparities elimination in health 
16
and health care as a matter of health and national 
17
security;

(4) adequate funding by fiscal year 2023, and 
19
subsequent funding increases, should be provided for

may determine, based on a pattern of com-
15

SEC. 10002. FINDINGS. 
8
Congress finds as follows: 
9
(1) Social determinants of health are the great-
10
est predictors of health outcomes. 
11
(2) Social determinants of health, including 
12
health-related behaviors, social and economic factors, 
13
and physical environment factors account for 80 per-
14
cent of health outcomes, whereas clinical care ac-
15
counts for 20 percent of improved health outcomes. 
16
Yet, in 2017, public health spending represented 
17
only 2.5 percent of all health spending in the United 
18
States. 
19
(3) There are more opportunities to improve 
20
health for everyone when we understand that health 
21
starts, first, not in a medical setting, but in our 
22
families, in our schools and workplaces, in our 
23
neighborhoods, in the air we breathe, and in the 
24
water we drink.

(4)(A) Healthy People 2030 identifies health 
1
and health care quality as a function of not only ac-
2
cess to health care, but also the social determinants 
3
of health, categorized into the following: neighbor-
4
hoods and the built environment; social and commu-
5
nity context; education; and economic stability. 
6
(B) The following examples illustrate the nexus 
7
between the unequal distribution of the social deter-
8
minants of health and health inequities: 
9
(i) The built environment influences resi-
10
dents’ level of physical activity. Neighborhoods 
11
with high levels of poverty are significantly less 
12
likely to have places where children can be 
13
physically active, such as parks, green spaces, 
14
and bike paths and lanes. Neighborhoods and 
15
communities can provide opportunities for phys-
16
ical activity and support active lifestyles 
17
through accessible and safe parks and open 
18
spaces and through land use policy, zoning, and 
19
healthy community design. 
20
(ii) Emotional and physical health and 
21
well-being are directly impacted by perceived 
22
levels of safety, such as unlit streets at night. 
23
Community members have expressed that safety 
24
is not only a barrier to accessing programs and 
25
20:42 Jun 23, 2022
H7585
1643 
•HR 7585 IH
services that increase quality of life, but also a 
1
barrier to accessing physical activity in their 
2
community through the built environment. 
3
(iii) Historical and institutional racism in 
4
the United States has shaped the way in which 
5
social and economic resources and exposure to 
6
health promoting environments are distributed. 
7
Income, education, occupation, neighborhood 
8
conditions, schools, workplaces, the use of 
9
health and social services, and experiences with 
10
the criminal justice system are all highly pat-
11
terned by race, with people of color experiencing 
12
more that is health harming. Finding ways to 
13
uncouple the link between race and access to re-
14
sources and healthy environments is a principal 
15
means of reducing health inequities. Addition-
16
ally, the anticipation of racism itself causes 
17
higher psychological and cardiovascular stress 
18
levels that are linked to poor health outcomes. 
19
Remedying discriminatory practices at the indi-
20
vidual and systemic levels will likely reduce 
21
health inequities caused by this unequal dis-
22
tribution of stress. 
23
(iv) Poor health among Native Americans 
24
has largely been driven by post-colonial oppres-
25
20:42 Jun 23, 2022
H7585
1644 
•HR 7585 IH
sion and historical trauma. The expropriation of 
1
native lands and territories to the American 
2
state had severe consequences on Native Amer-
3
ican health. This resulted in the deprivation of 
4
traditional food sources—and nutrients—for 
5
Native Americans and also the destruction of 
6
traditional economies and community organiza-
7
tion. Today, Native Americans have twice the 
8
rate of diabetes of non-Hispanic Whites. Rec-
9
ognition of the origins of diabetes as having a 
10
social and community context, rather than just 
11
individual responsibility and genetic predisposi-
12
tion, will shape better policy to provide food se-
13
curity. 
14
(v) In the context of prisons, overcrowding 
15
has led to the deterioration of the physical and 
16
mental health of individuals after they leave 
17
prison. In particular, the mass incarceration of 
18
African-American males as a result of inequities 
19
within and treatment in the criminal justice 
20
system has contributed to an overburdening of 
21
certain infectious diseases within the African- 
22
American community. As a social institution, 
23
incarceration amplifies existing adverse health 
24
conditions by concentrating diseases and harm-
25
20:42 Jun 23, 2022
H7585
1645 
•HR 7585 IH
ful health behaviors such as tobacco use, drug 
1
use, and violence. 
2
(vi) Educational attainment is the strong-
3
est predictor of adult mortality. It is a basic 
4
component of socioeconomic status that shapes 
5
earning potential to access resources that pro-
6
mote health. People with more education are 
7
less likely to report that they are in poor health, 
8
and are also less likely to have diabetes and 
9
other chronic diseases. 
10
(vii) Individuals with lower levels of edu-
11
cational attainment are much more likely to re-
12
port to be current smokers. In 2017, smoking 
13
prevalence was 36.8 percent among adults with 
14
a GED diploma, 23.1 percent with less than a 
15
high school diploma, and 18.7 percent with a 
16
high school diploma, while dropping signifi-
17
cantly to 7.1 percent among adults with an un-
18
dergraduate college degree and 4.1 percent with 
19
a postgraduate college degree. 
20
(viii) Income inequality differences account 
21
for a large part of health inequities. For exam-
22

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following find-
8
ings: 
9
(1) Health impact assessment is a tool to help 
10
planners, health officials, decision makers, and the 
11
public make more informed decisions about the po-
12
tential health effects of proposed plans, policies, pro-
13
grams, and projects in order to maximize health 
14
benefits and minimize harms. 
15
(2) Health impact assessments foster commu-
16
nity leadership, ownership, and participation in deci-
17
sion-making processes. 
18
(3) Health impact assessments can build com-
19
munity support and reduce opposition to a project or 
20
policy, thereby facilitating economic growth by aid-
21
ing the development of consensus regarding new de-
22
velopment proposals. 
23
(4) Health impact assessments facilitate col-
24
laboration across sectors.

SEC. 10011. INVESTING IN COMMUNITY HEALING. 
3
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
4
(1) According to the Bureau of Justice Statis-
5
tics, African Americans are more likely to have face- 
6
to-face contact with law enforcement and are 2.5 
7
times more likely to experience a threat or use of 
8
nonfatal force by police. 
9
(2) Research shows that young men who have 
10
experienced these law enforcement practices display 
11
higher levels of stress, anxiety, and trauma associ-
12
ated with the interaction. 
13
(3) Witnessing or experiencing invasive encoun-
14
ters with law enforcement can also be an everyday 
15
stressor for racial and ethnic minorities, leading to 
16
physiological and psychological strain. 
17
(4) Racial and ethnic minorities face inequities 
18
in accessing mental health services. 
19
(5) Addressing the stigma in some communities 
20
of color associated with receiving mental health serv-
21
ices and informing individuals about available treat-
22
ment can encourage better utilization of these serv-
23
ices.

vironmental justice communities as a result of sys-
1
temic injustices relating to factors that include race 
2
and income; 
3
(2) environmental justice communities have in-
4
creased vulnerability to the adverse effects of climate 
5
change and need significant investment to face cur-
6
rent and future environmental hazards; 
7
(3) the Federal Government has lacked a cohe-
8
sive and consistent strategy to carry out the respon-
9
sibilities of Federal agencies described in Executive 
10
Order 12898 (42 U.S.C. 4321 note; relating to Fed-
11
eral actions to address environmental justice in mi-
12
nority populations and low-income populations); 
13
(4) it is necessary that the Federal Government 
14
meaningfully engage environmental justice commu-
15
nities in the process of developing a robust strategy 
16
to address environmental justice, including high lev-
17
els of review, input, and consent; 
18
(5) there is a lack of nationwide high-quality 
19
data relating to environmental justice concerns, such 
20
as socioeconomic factors, air pollution, water pollu-
21
tion, soil pollution, and public health, and a failure 
22
to update the existing data with adequate frequency; 
23
(6) there is no nationally consistent method to 
24
identify environmental justice communities based on

1729 
•HR 7585 IH
the cumulative effects of socioeconomic factors, pol-
1
lution burden, and public health; 
2
(7) a method described in paragraph (6) is 
3
needed to correct for racist and unjust practices 
4
leading to historical and current environmental in-
5
justices through the targeted investment in environ-
6
mental justice communities of at least 40 percent of 
7
the funds provided for a clean energy transition and 
8
other related investments, including transportation 
9
infrastructure, housing infrastructure, and water 
10
quality infrastructure; 
11
(8) funds targeted for environmental justice 
12
communities should include set-asides for technical 
13
assistance and capacity building for environmental 
14
justice communities to access the funds; 
15
(9) particular oversight and care are necessary 
16
when investing in environmental justice communities 
17
to ensure that existing issues are not exacerbated 
18
and new issues are not created, particularly issues 
19
relating to pollution burden and the displacement of 
20
residents; 
21
(10) several States, academic institutions, and 
22
nonprofit organizations have engaged in cumulative 
23
impact environmental justice mapping efforts that 
24
can serve as references for a Federal mapping effort;

(11) many environmental justice communities, 
1
such as communities in ‘‘Cancer Alley’’ in the State 
2
of Louisiana, have been clearly affected by extreme 
3
environmental hazards such that the communities— 
4
(A) are identifiable before the establish-
5
ment of the tool under paragraph (2) of sub-
6
section (d) and the completion of the data gap 
7
audit under paragraph (4) of that subsection; 
8
and 
9
(B) should be eligible for programs tar-
10
geted toward environmental justice communities 
11
that have faced extreme environmental hazards 
12
before the establishment of that tool and the 
13
completion of that audit; 
14
(12) in addition to investment in environmental 
15
justice communities, pollution reduction is essential 
16
to achieving equitable access to a healthy and clean 
17
environment and an equitable energy system; and 
18
(13) specific policy and permitting decisions 
19
and investments may rely on different combinations 
20
of data sets and indicators relating to environmental 
21
justice, and race alone may be considered a criterion 
22
when assessing the susceptibility of a community to 
23
environmental injustice.

SEC. 10013. ANTIRACISM IN PUBLIC HEALTH. 
12
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following find-
13
ings: 
14
(1) For centuries, structural racism, defined by 
15
the National Museum of African American History 
16
and Culture as an ‘‘overarching system of racial bias 
17
across institutions and society,’’ in the United States 
18
has negatively affected communities of color, espe-
19
cially Black, Latinx, Asian American, Pacific Is-
20
lander, and American Indian and Alaska Native peo-
21
ple, to expand and reinforce White supremacy. 
22
(2) Structural racism determines the conditions 
23
in which people are born, grow, work, live, and age 
24
and determine people’s access to quality housing, 
25

H7585
1762 
•HR 7585 IH
education, food, transportation, and political power, 
1
and other social determinants of health. 
2
(3) Structural racism serves as a major barrier 
3
to achieving health equity and eliminating racial and 
4
ethnic inequities in health outcomes that exist at 
5
alarming rates and are determined by a wider set of 
6
forces and systems. 
7
(4) Due to structural racism in the United 
8
States, people of color are more likely to suffer from 
9
chronic health conditions (such as heart disease, dia-
10
betes, asthma, hepatitis, and hypertension) and in-
11
fectious diseases (such as HIV/AIDS, and COVID– 
12
19) compared to their White counterparts. 
13
(5) Due to structural racism in maternal health 
14
care in the United States, Black and American In-
15
dian and Alaska Native infants are more than twice 
16
as likely to die than White infants, Black women are 
17
3 to 4 times more likely to die from pregnancy-re-
18
lated causes than White women, and American In-
19
dian and Alaska Native women are 5 times more 
20
likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than 
21
White women. This trend persists even when adjust-
22
ing for income and education. 
23
(6) Due to structural racism in the United 
24
States, Non-Hispanic Black women have the highest 
25
20:42 Jun 23, 2022
H7585
1763 
•HR 7585 IH
rates for 22 of 25 severe morbidity indicators used 
1
by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention 
2
(CDC). 
3
(7) Due to structural racism in the United 
4
States, people of color comprise a disproportionate 
5
percentage of persons with disabilities in the United 
6
States. 
7
(8) Due to structural racism in the United 
8
States, Black men are up to three and a half times 
9
as likely to be killed by police as White men, and 1 
10
in every 1,000 Black men will die as a result of po-
11
lice violence. Policing has adverse effects on mental 
12
health in Black communities. 
13
(9) Due to the confluence of structural racism 
14
and factors such as gender, class, and sexual ori-
15
entation or gender identity, commonly referred to as 
16
intersectionality, Black and Latinx transgender 
17
women are more likely to die due to violence and 
18
homicide than their White counterparts. 
19
(10) Due to structural racism, inequitable ac-
20
cess to quality health care and long-term services 
21
and supports also disproportionately burdens com-
22
munities of color; people of color and immigrants are 
23
less likely to be insured and are more likely to live 
24
in medically underserved areas. 
25
20:42 Jun 23, 2022
H7585
1764 
•HR 7585 IH
(11) Due to structural racism, older adults of 
1
color are also more likely to be admitted to nursing 
2
homes and assisted living facilities and to reside in 
3
those of poor quality, and when older adults of color 
4
do receive home and community based services, Med-
5
icaid spends less money on their services and they 
6
are more likely to be hospitalized than older White 
7
adults. 
8
(12) In addition, the Federal Government’s fail-
9
ure to honor the unique political status of American 
10
Indian and Alaska Native people, to respect the in-
11
herent sovereignty of Tribal Nations, and to uphold 
12
its trust and treaty obligations to Tribal Nations 
13
and American Indian and Alaska Native people, is 
14
an ongoing and unjust manifestation of centuries of 
15
oppression, with the consequence of adverse health 
16
outcomes for Native peoples. 
17
(13) The COVID–19 pandemic has exposed the 
18
devastating impact of structural racism on the 
19
United States ability to ensure equitable health out-
20
comes for people of color, and made these commu-
21
nities more likely to suffer from severe outcomes due 
22
to the coronavirus infection. 
23
(14) Racial and ethnic inequity in public health 
24
is a result of systematic, personally mediated, and 
25

IMPROVING 
SOCIAL 
DETERMINANTS 
OF 
16
HEALTH. 
17
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
18
(1) Healthy People 2030 defines social deter-
19
minants of health as conditions in the environments 
20
where people are born, live, learn, work, play, wor-
21
ship, and age that affect a wide range of health, 
22
functioning, and quality-of-life outcomes and risks. 
23
(2) One of the overarching goals of Healthy 
24
People 2030 is to ‘‘create social, physical, and eco-
25
20:42 Jun 23, 2022
H7585
1796 
•HR 7585 IH
nomic environments that promote attaining the full 
1
potential for health and well-being for all’’. 
2
(3) Healthy People 2030 developed a ‘‘place- 
3
based’’ organizing framework, reflecting five key 
4
areas of social determinants of health namely— 
5
(A) economic stability; 
6
(B) education access and quality; 
7
(C) social and community context; 
8
(D) health care access and quality; and 
9
(E) neighborhood and built environment. 
10
(4) It is estimated that medical care accounts 
11
for only 10 to 20 percent of the modifiable contribu-
12
tors to healthy outcomes for a population. 
13
(5) The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Serv-
14
ices has indicated the importance of the social deter-
15
minants in its work stating that, ‘‘As we seek to fos-
16
ter innovation, rethink rural health, find solutions to 
17
the opioid epidemic, and continue to put patients 
18
first, we need to take into account social deter-
19
minants of health and recognize their importance.’’. 
20
(6) The Department of Health and Human 
21
Services’ Public Health 3.0 initiative recognizes the 
22
role of public health in working across sectors on so-
23
cial determinants of health, as well as the role of 
24
20:42 Jun 23, 2022
H7585
1797 
•HR 7585 IH
public health as chief health strategist in commu-
1
nities. 
2
(7) Through its Health Impact in 5 Years ini-
3
tiative, the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
4
tion has highlighted nonclinical, community-wide ap-
5
proaches that show positive health impacts, results 
6
within five years, and cost-effectiveness or cost-sav-
7
ings over the lifetime of the population or earlier. 
8
(8) Health departments and the Centers for 
9
Disease Control and Prevention are not funded for 
10
such cross-cutting work.
