RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the designation of the week of August 
25 through August 31, 2021, as ‘‘Black Breastfeeding 
Week’’ to bring national attention to the United States 
maternal child health crisis in the Black community and 
the important role that breastfeeding plays in improving 
maternal and infant health outcomes. 
Whereas according to the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention 2019 statistics, Black mothers ‘‘breastfeeding 
initiation rate was nearly 74 percent compared to White 
mothers’’ rate of 86 percent; 
Whereas breastfeeding directly impacts the health and 
wellness of infants and the mothers who care for them;

Whereas Black mothers have reported greater barriers to 
breastfeeding compared to their counterparts, including 
pain or discomfort while breastfeeding, concerns about 
breastfeeding in public, insufficient availability of pro-
motional and educational efforts, and the interference of 
breastfeeding with paid employment and other activities; 
Whereas some Black mothers have also reported lack of a so-
cial support system for continued breastfeeding; 
Whereas in North Carolina, only 70 percent of Black mothers 
attempted to breastfeed in 2019, versus 84 percent of 
White mothers and State average of 81 percent of all 
birthing parents in the State who breastfed during the 
same period; 
Whereas Black babies suffer over a two times higher infant 
mortality rates than White babies in North Carolina; 
Whereas low breastfeeding initiation rates directly correlate 
to high infant mortality rates; 
Whereas babies who are breastfed for at least three months 
have a 38-percent reduced risk of infant mortality annu-
ally across the United States; 
Whereas Black children are at a greater risk for childhood 
disease, and the inability to exclusively breastfeed for the 
recommended six months has been attributed to twice as 
many deaths and three times as many childhood diseases 
in Black infants as compared to White infants; 
Whereas one in four mothers in the United States return to 
work within ten days of giving birth; 
Whereas 60 percent of working mothers in the United States 
who are breastfeeding express breast milk in inadequate 
and unsanitary places on the job;

•HRES 603 IH 
Whereas COVID–19 has tragically exposed the unfortunate 
impact of racial inequities in health for Black commu-
nities; 
Whereas these inequities have led to Black communities being 
disproportionately impacted by the virus, including forced 
separations of mothers and infants after birth when 
breast milk is the safest and most reliable form of infant 
feeding during an emergency or pandemic; 
Whereas understanding such historical and contemporary ra-
cial inequities is important to address systemic injustices 
preventing families from achieving their breastfeeding po-
tential; 
Whereas if mothers could meet current medical recommenda-
tions for breastfeeding, it would save the United States 
economy nearly $13 billion per year in pediatric health 
costs and premature deaths; 
Whereas Black Breastfeeding Week is an opportunity to raise 
awareness about the maternal child health crisis in Black 
communities and the important role that breastfeeding 
plays in improving maternal and infant health outcomes; 
Whereas this week is dedicated to increasing awareness of the 
critical role of breastfeeding and the work of Black com-
munity-led groups in improving family health and reduc-
ing infant mortality rates in Black communities; and 
Whereas a week highlighting a unique and targeted approach 
to address the challenges facing Black mothers and fami-
lies is critical to eliminating racial disparities in breast-
feeding and breast cancer survival: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives recog-
