SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Authoritarian leaders in foreign countries 
3
abuse their power to steal assets from state institu-
4
tions, enrich themselves at the expense of their coun-
5
tries’ economic development, and use corruption as 
6
a strategic tool both to solidify their grip on power 
7
and to undermine democratic institutions abroad. 
8
(2) Global corruption harms the competitiveness 
9
of United States businesses, weakens democratic 
10
governance, 
feeds 
terrorist 
recruitment 
and 
11
transnational organized crime, enables drug smug-
12
gling and human trafficking, and stymies economic 
13
growth. 
14
(3) Illicit financial flows often penetrate coun-
15
tries through what appear to be legitimate financial 
16
transactions, as kleptocrats launder money, use shell 
17
companies, amass offshore wealth, and participate in 
18
a global shadow economy. 
19
(4) The Government of the Russian Federation 
20
is a leading model of this type of kleptocratic sys-

tem, using state-sanctioned corruption to both erode 
1
democratic governance from within and discredit de-
2
mocracy abroad, thereby strengthening the authori-
3
tarian rule of Vladimir Putin. 
4
(5) Corrupt individuals and entities in the Rus-
5
sian Federation, often with the backing and encour-
6
agement of political leadership, use stolen money— 
7
(A) to purchase key assets in other coun-
8
tries, often with a goal of attaining monopolistic 
9
control of a sector; 
10
(B) to gain access to and influence the 
11
policies of other countries; and 
12
(C) to advance Russian interests in other 
13
countries, particularly those that undermine 
14
confidence and trust in democratic systems. 
15
(6) Systemic corruption in the People’s Repub-
16
lic of China, often tied to, directed by, or backed by 
17
the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and 
18
the Chinese Government is used— 
19
(A) to provide unfair advantage to certain 
20
People’s Republic of China economic entities; 
21
(B) to increase other countries’ economic 
22
dependence on the People’s Republic of China 
23
to secure greater deference to the People’s Re-

public of China’s diplomatic and strategic goals; 
1
and 
2
(C) to exploit corruption in foreign govern-
3
ments and among other political elites to enable 
4
People’s Republic of China state-backed firms 
5
to pursue predatory and exploitative economic 
6
practices. 
7
(7) Thwarting these tactics by Russian, Chi-
8
nese, and other kleptocratic actors requires the 
9
international community to strengthen democratic 
10
governance and the rule of law. International co-
11
operation in combating corruption and illicit finance 
12
is vital to such efforts, especially by empowering re-
13
formers in foreign countries during historic political 
14
openings for the establishment of the rule of law in 
15
those countries. 
16
(8) Technical assistance programs that combat 
17
corruption and strengthen the rule of law, including 
18
through assistance provided by the Department of 
19
State’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law 
20
Enforcement Affairs and the United States Agency 
21
for International Development, and through pro-
22
grams like the Department of Justice’s Office of
