SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Jobs, On-the-Job 
2
‘Earn-While-You-Learn’ Training, and Apprenticeships 
3
for Young African Americans Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
5
Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) Young African-American men and women 
7
are the hardest hit by economic instability. Declared 
8
and affirmed by the Federal Reserve, African Ameri-
9
cans face unemployment rates that are two to three 
10
times higher than their White counterparts for the 
11
last several decades. 
12
(2) During economic recessions in 1974 
13
through 1975, 1981 through 1982, 1990 through 
14
1991, and 2008, the African-American community 
15
faced significantly higher unemployment rates than 
16
their White counterparts. 
17
(3) Even during times of economic growth, Af-
18
rican-American communities experience prolonged fi-
19
nancial vulnerability and delayed recovery. Unem-
20
ployment rates decline at a slower rate for African- 
21
American men, and even a slower rate for African- 
22
American women as compared to their White coun-
23
terparts. 
24
(4) Affirmed by the Department of Labor, di-
25
versity and inclusion within the workforce benefits

employees and businesses across all industries, in-
1
cluding apprenticeship programs, which provide eco-
2
nomic mobility to its participants. 
3
(5) Through the combined efforts of building 
4
trades unions and community partners at the State 
5
and local level, there have been established more 
6
than 150 apprenticeship readiness programs across 
7
the United States that focus on creating pathways 
8
to Registered Programs for people of color, women, 
9
and veterans. Overall, from 2009 to 2019, building 
10
trades unions and their signatory contractors have 
11
invested over $100,000,000 in outreach efforts tar-
12
geting under-represented communities to participate 
13
in apprenticeship readiness programs. Of the 4,800 
14
individuals who have successfully completed a build-
15
ing trades apprenticeship readiness program since 
16
2016, 70 percent were from communities of color 
17
and 22 percent were women. 
18
(6) The disproportionately high-unemployment 
19
rates, combined with low participation rates from 
20
African Americans in registered apprenticeship pro-
21
grams not only constitute a national crisis but a na-
22
tional tragedy for the young African Americans, 
23
many of whom are fathers and mothers who, without
