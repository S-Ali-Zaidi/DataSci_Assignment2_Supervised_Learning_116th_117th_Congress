the social, economic, and political environments that led 
to the development of discriminatory laws targeting 
Asians and Pacific Islanders and their relation to current 
events, and the impact and contributions of Asian Ameri-
cans to the development and enhancement of American 
life, United States history, literature, the economy, poli-
tics, body of laws, and culture, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Teaching Asian Pacific

American History Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) The United States of America has benefited 
8
from the integral role Asian Americans and Pacific 
9
Islanders have played in our country’s history and 
10
contributions to the world. 
11
(2) The Pacific Island Territories of Guam, 
12
American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the 
13
Northern Mariana Islands have unique histories that 
14
are often overlooked in American history despite 
15
their immense contributions to our Nation. 
16
(3) The traditional American K–12 curriculum 
17
continues to be taught from a Eurocentric point of 
18
view and exclude histories of racist immigration laws 
19
relevant to policies today.

(4) K–12 social studies textbooks poorly rep-
1
resent Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, over-
2
look the diversity within those communities, and 
3
print images of Asian Americans and Pacific Island-
4
ers in stereotypical roles. 
5
(5) The Federal Government, through support 
6
for educational activities of national museums estab-
7
lished under Federal law, can assist teachers in ef-
8
forts to incorporate historically accurate instruction 
9
on the comprehensive history of Asian Americans 
10
and Pacific Islanders and assist students in their ex-
11
ploration of Asian Pacific American history as an in-
12
tegral part of American history. 
13
(6) The history of America’s system of immi-
14
gration is rife with racism, embedded in goals of hir-
15
ing workers to work for cheaper wages and labor in 
16
heinous working conditions. 
17
(7) Congress has continuously passed anti- 
18
Asian laws as the result of the scapegoating of Asian 
19
immigrant laborers for the United States economic 
20
downturns. 
21
(8) The history of South Asian Americans in 
22
the United States dates back to the late 1700s.

(9) The history of Native Hawaiians and Pa-
1
cific Islanders in what is now considered to be the 
2
United States predates the founding of our Nation. 
3
(10) In 1993, Congress passed a resolution that 
4
was signed into law formally apologizing for the 
5
United States role in the illegal overthrow of the 
6
Kingdom of Hawaii, which resulted in the suppres-
7
sion of the inherent sovereignty of the Native Ha-
8
waiian people. 
9
(11) Twelve thousand Chinese laborers worked 
10
in atrocious conditions to build the Transcontinental 
11
Railroad, many dying from harsh weather conditions 
12
and the dangers of handling explosives. 
13
(12) The Page Act of 1875 was the United 
14
States first restrictive immigration law, which 
15
sought to prevent the entry of Asian women per-
16
ceived as immoral or suspected of prostitution. 
17
(13) After the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 
18
banned Chinese immigrants from immigrating to the 
19
United States, Japanese were hired. After the Japa-
20
nese were banned from immigrating due to the Gen-
21
tleman’s Agreement of 1907, which halted immigra-
22
tion from Japan, Filipinos were hired under 3-year 
23
contracts.

(14) Filipino farm workers helped found the 
1
farm worker labor movement. 
2
(15) The Immigration Act of 1917 restricted 
3
immigration to the United States by barring immi-
4
gration from the Asia-Pacific zone. 
5
(16) The Immigration Act of 1924 set a na-
6
tional origin quota to deter immigration. 
7
(17) President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Execu-
8
tive Order 9066 authorized the incarceration of over 
9
120,000 persons of Japanese ancestry, two-thirds of 
10
whom were American citizens, based solely on race. 
11
(18) Beginning in 1954, the United States dis-
12
placed over 3,000,000 refugees from Cambodia, 
13
Laos, and Vietnam due to covert and overt United 
14
States military operations in Southeast Asia. 
15
(19) The Immigration Act of 1965 made family 
16
unification and skills-based migration the bedrock 
17
principle of immigration to the United States. 
18
(20) The United States conducted nuclear test-
19
ing on the Bikini and Enewetak Atoll of the Mar-
20
shall Islands have made parts of the island nation 
21
uninhabitable and caused forced migration and 
22
health complications that still impact the community 
23
today.

(21) The United States ratified a Compact of 
1
Free Association with the Federated States of Mi-
2
cronesia, Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the 
3
Republic of Palau enabling citizens of these Pacific 
4
Island nations to legally migrate to the United 
5
States visa-free while the United States retains cer-
6
tain strategic military rights over their territorial 
7
waters. 
8
(22) In the aftermath of the Vietnam War, the 
9
Refugee Act of 1980 helped more than 500,000 
10
Southeast Asians gain permanent resident status in 
11
the United States within the first decade of its pas-
12
sage. 
13
(23) The Pacific Islander community represents 
14
the largest concentration of any ethnic group en-
15
listed in the United States military, as well as rep-
16
resenting the highest numbers of casualties in the 
17
current wars on terror. 
18
(24) The ‘‘model minority’’ myth perpetuates 
19
the stigma of Asian Americans as perpetual for-
20
eigners, and such stereotypes are used to pit minor-
21
ity groups against one another. 
22
(25) The pattern of hate crimes and hate inci-
23
dents directed at Asians and Asian Americans has 
24
repeated itself throughout history.

(26) Asian-American and African-American his-
1
tories of fighting against oppression and racism are 
2
intertwined, from the Black Power Movement of the 
3
1960s that birthed the Asian American Movement to 
4
civil rights protests today.

(27) Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and 
6
their allies continue to fight discrimination, racial 
7

8
