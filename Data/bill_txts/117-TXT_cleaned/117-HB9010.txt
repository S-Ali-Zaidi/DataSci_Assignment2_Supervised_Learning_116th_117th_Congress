SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Since 1949, the close relationship between 
3
the United States and Taiwan has been of enormous 
4
benefit to both parties and to the Indo-Pacific region 
5
as a whole.

(2) The Taiwan Relations Act (Public Law 96– 
1
8; 22 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.) has enabled the people 
2
of the United States and the people of Taiwan to 
3
maintain a strong and important relationship that 
4
promotes regional security, prosperity, and shared 
5
democratic values. 
6
(3) The security of Taiwan and the ability for 
7
the people of Taiwan to determine their own future 
8
is fundamental to United States interests and val-
9
ues. 
10
(4) The Taipei Economic and Cultural Rep-
11
resentative Office in the United States and the 
12
American Institute in Taiwan facilitate critical con-
13
sular relations that— 
14
(A) protect the interests of the people of 
15
the United States and the people of Taiwan; 
16
and 
17
(B) strengthen people-to-people ties. 
18
(5) Increased engagement between public offi-
19
cials, commercial interests, civil society leaders, and 
20
others enhances United States-Taiwan relations and 
21
its economic, security, and democratic dimensions. 
22
(6) Taiwan serves as a critical partner on re-
23
gional and transnational issues, such as public 
24
health, climate change, critical and emerging tech-

nologies, cybersecurity, trade, and freedom of navi-
1
gation. 
2
(7) Taiwan exemplifies a thriving democracy 
3
consisting of more than 23,000,000 people who 
4
value their suffrage, free markets, right to due proc-
5
ess, freedom of expression, and other individual lib-
6
erties. 
7
(8) President Xi Jinping of the People’s Repub-
8
lic of China (referred to in this Act as the ‘‘PRC’’) 
9
continues to repeat his desire to stifle the freedom 
10
of Taiwan, as evidenced by his July 2021 proclama-
11
tion, in which he stated, ‘‘All sons and daughters of 
12
China, including compatriots on both sides of the 
13
Taiwan Strait, must work together and move for-
14
ward in solidarity, resolutely smashing any Taiwan 
15
independence plots.’’. 
16
(9) As President Xi Jinping consolidates his 
17
power in the Chinese Communist Party (referred to 
18
in this Act as the ‘‘CCP’’), he is escalating the 
19
PRC’s campaign of coercion and intimidation 
20
against Taiwan, as evidenced by— 
21
(A) the accelerated preparations made by 
22
the PRC and its People’s Liberation Army (re-
23
ferred to in this Act as the ‘‘PLA’’) for an of-
24
fensive attack against Taiwan, such as the

4
tions in the Taiwan Strait, such as amphibious

8
forts to isolate Taiwan, such as abusing its po-

(D) threats and actions to compromise 
14
Taiwan’s economy and critical suppliers, such 
15
as draconian export controls and the ‘‘31 Meas-
16
ures’’ intended to lure Taiwanese talent to 
17
mainland China and away from Taiwan; 
18
(E) persistent and targeted cyberattacks, 
19
numbering nearly 20,000,000 per month, which 
20
are intended to compromise Taiwan’s critical 
21
infrastructure and inflict civilian harm;

(10) On multiple occasions, through both for-
4
mal and informal channels, the United States has 
5
expressed its concern for the PRC’s destabilizing ac-
6

7

(C) reaffirms that Taiwan’s future must be 
16
determined peacefully and in accordance with 
17

19
(12) The PRC considers stifling the freedom of 
20
Taiwan as a critical and necessary step to displacing 
21
the United States as the preeminent military power 
22
in the Indo-Pacific and continues its modernization

the United States to defend Taiwan for the purposes 
8
of— 
9
(A) mitigating the PLA’s ability to project 
10
power and establish contested zones within the

TITLE V—ENHANCED DEVELOP-

MENT AND ECONOMIC CO-
4
OPERATION 
BETWEEN 
THE 
5
UNITED STATES AND TAIWAN 
6
SEC. 501. FINDINGS. 
7
Congress makes the following findings: 
8
(1) Taiwan has been an important trading part-
9
ner of the United States for many years, accounting 
10
for $114,000,000,000 in two-way trade in 2021. 
11
(2) Taiwan has demonstrated the capacity to 
12
hold a strong economic partnership with the United 
13
States. Along with a robust trading profile of goods 
14
and services, Taiwan supports an estimated 208,000 
15
American jobs and its cumulative investment in the 
16
United States is at least $13,700,000,000, numbers 
17
that will only increase with a comprehensive bilateral 
18
trade agreement. 
19
(3) In addition to supplementing United States 
20
goods and services, Taiwan is a reliable partner in 
21
many United States industries, which is not only 
22
critical for diversifying United States supply chains, 
23
but is also essential to reducing the United States 
24
reliance on other countries, such as China, who seek 
25
19:24 Oct 28, 2022
H9010
75 
•HR 9010 IH
to leverage supply chain inefficiencies in their path 
1
to regional and global dominance. Such diversifica-
2
tion of United States supply chains is critical to our 
3
national security. 
4
(4) The challenges to establishing an agreement 
5
with Taiwan, such as reaching an agreement on ag-
6
ricultural standards, must not prevent the comple-
7
tion of a bilateral trade agreement. Taiwan has al-
8
ready taken steps to further the progress towards 
9
such an agreement by announcing its intent to lift 
10
restrictions on United States pork and beef prod-
11
ucts, which will greatly increase the accessibility of 
12
American farmers and ranchers to Taiwan markets. 
13
In light of this important development, the United 
14
States should immediately move forward with sub-
15
stantial negotiations for a comprehensive bilateral 
16
trade agreement with Taiwan. 
17
(5) A free and open Indo-Pacific is a goal that 
18
needs to be actively pursued to counter China’s use 
19
of unfair trading practices and other policies to ad-
20
vance its economic dominance in the Indo-Pacific re-
21
gion. An agreement with Taiwan would— 
22
(A) help the United States accomplish this 
23
goal by building a network of like-minded gov-
24
ernments dedicated to fair competition and 
25
19:24 Oct 28, 2022
H9010
76 
•HR 9010 IH
open markets that are free from government 
1
manipulation; and 
2
(B) encourage other nations to deepen eco-
3
nomic ties with Taiwan. 
4
(6) Since November 2020, Taiwan and the 
5
United States have engaged in the U.S.-Taiwan Eco-
6
nomic Prosperity Partnership Dialogue, covering a 
7
broad range of economic issues including— 
8
(A) 5G networks and telecommunications 
9
security; 
10
(B) supply chains resiliency; 
11
(C) infrastructure cooperation; 
12
(D) renewable energy; 
13
(E) global health; and 
14
(F) science and technology. 
15
(7) A trade agreement between the United 
16
States and Taiwan would promote security and eco-
17
nomic growth for the United States, Taiwan, and 
18
the entire Indo-Pacific region. 
19
(8) Excluding Taiwan from the Indo-Pacific 
20
Economic Framework would— 
21
(A) create significant distortions in the re-
22
gional and global economic architecture; and 
23
(B) run counter to the United States eco-
24
nomic interests.

(9) Taiwan is the United States largest trading

partner with whom we do not have an income tax 
2
treaty or agreement. Taiwan has such agreements 
3
with 34 countries, including countries that have 
4
trade agreements with the United States and do not 
5
maintain diplomatic relations with Taiwan. 
6
(10) The American Chamber of Commerce in 
7
Taipei, in its ‘‘2022 Taiwan White Paper’’, called 
8
for the United States and Taiwan to continue ex-
9
ploring an income tax agreement to boost bilateral 
10

and increasing economic efficiency and integration.
