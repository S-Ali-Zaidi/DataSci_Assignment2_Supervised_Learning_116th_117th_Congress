RESOLUTION 
Condemning and censuring Representative Marjorie Taylor 
Greene of Georgia. 
Whereas on May 20, 2021, during an interview on Real 
America’s Voice network’s ‘‘The Water Cooler’’, Rep-
resentative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia compared 
proof of a COVID–19 vaccination to the Holocaust and 
said, ‘‘We can look back at a time in history where people 
were told to wear a gold star [sic] and they were defi-
nitely treated like second-class citizens, so much so that 
they were put in trains and taken to gas chambers in 
Nazi Germany and this is exactly the type of abuse that 
Nancy Pelosi is talking about.’’; 
Whereas on May 25, 2021, Representative Greene repeated 
the comparison in a tweet that said, ‘‘Vaccinated employ-
ees get a vaccination logo just like the Nazis forced Jew-

ish people to wear a gold star [sic]. Vaccine passports & 
mask mandates create discrimination against unvaxxed 
people who trust their immune systems to a virus that is 
99% survivable.’’; 
Whereas on May 25, 2021, Representative Greene posted a 
tweet about universities requiring students to be vac-
cinated that said, ‘‘It appears Nazi practices have already 
begun on our youth. Show your VAX papers or no in per-
son class for you. This is exactly what I was saying about 
the gold star [sic].’’; 
Whereas on June 14, 2021, after visiting the United States 
Holocaust Memorial Museum, Representative Greene of-
fered an apology and said, ‘‘There are words that I have 
said, remarks that I’ve made that I know are offensive, 
and for that I’d like to apologize.’’; 
Whereas on September 1, 2022, despite her earlier apology, 
Representative Greene posted a tweet correlating Presi-
dent Joe Biden to Adolf Hitler that said, ‘‘Joe Biden is 
Hitler. #NaziJoe has to go.’’; 
Whereas on September 1, 2022, Representative Greene post-
ed another tweet that included doctored video to show 
President Biden speaking with audio of Hitler, swastikas 
in the background, and a mustache akin to that of Hit-
ler; 
Whereas Representative Greene’s repeated comments debase 
the memory of the 6,000,000 Jews murdered by the 
Nazis, the survivors of the Holocaust, and their families, 
as well as all those who fought and died defending de-
mocracy against Hitler and his evil;

Whereas the United States has recently experienced a dan-
gerous rise in hate, racism, and violence directed at Jews 
as well as other racial, ethnic, and religious minorities; 
Whereas Congress as a whole, and Members individually, 
have a duty to condemn rather than amplify hate, big-
otry, and racism; and 
Whereas Representative Greene’s intentional diminishment of 
the horrors of the Nazis, her repeated inappropriate com-
parisons to a genocide involving the systematic murder of 
6,000,000 Jews, her demonstration that her June 2021 
apology was insincere, and her callous refusal to refrain 
from her hateful rhetoric has brought shame on the 
House of Representatives and jeopardized its reputation 
and institutional integrity: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That— 
1
(1) Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of 
2
Georgia be condemned and censured; 
3
(2) Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene 
4
forthwith present herself in the well of the House of 
5
Representatives for the pronouncement of censure; 
6
and 
7
(3) Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene be 
8
censured with the public reading of this resolution 
9
by the Speaker.
