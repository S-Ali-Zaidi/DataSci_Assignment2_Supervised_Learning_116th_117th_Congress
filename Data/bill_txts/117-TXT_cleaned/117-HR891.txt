RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the article of amendment (commonly known as the 
‘‘Equal Rights Amendment’’) to the Constitution is valid. 
Whereas 2⁄3 of each House of the 92d Congress duly proposed 
in 1972 an article of amendment (commonly known as 
the ‘‘Equal Rights Amendment’’) to the Constitution that 
provides the following: 
‘‘SECTION 1. Equality of rights under the law shall not 
be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State 
on account of sex. 
‘‘SEC. 2. The Congress shall have the power to enforce, 
by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article. 
‘‘SEC. 3. This amendment shall take effect two years 
after the date of ratification.’’; 
Whereas the Equal Rights Amendment provides a stronger 
constitutional basis for combating sex discrimination and 
provides Congress with more authority to enact laws that 
ensure sex equality; 
Whereas the House of Representative passed the Equal 
Rights Amendment on October 12, 1971, with a vote of

(38) Virginia (January 27, 2020); 
Whereas no time limit exists within the text of the proposed 
amendment that was ratified by more than 3⁄4 of the 
States; 
Whereas the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868 was published 
to the Constitution despite 2 States purporting to rescind 
their ratifications; 
Whereas the Archivist of the United States has a statutory 
and ministerial duty to certify that a proposed amend-
ment to the Constitution is valid and has become part of 
the Constitution once it is ratified by more than 3⁄4 of the 
States; and 
Whereas section 3 of the Equal Rights Amendment states 
that the amendment shall take effect 2 years after the 
last constitutionally necessary State ratification occurs, 
which was January 27, 2020: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-
1
resentatives that the article of amendment to the Constitu-
