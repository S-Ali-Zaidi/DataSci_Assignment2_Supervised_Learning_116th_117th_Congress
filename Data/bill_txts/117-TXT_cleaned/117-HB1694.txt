transfer of personal property to Federal and State agen-
cies, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Stop Militarizing Law 
4
Enforcement Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress makes the following findings: 
7
(1) Under section 2576a of title 10, United 
8
States Code, the Department of Defense is author-
9
ized to provide excess property to local law enforce-
10
ment agencies. The Defense Logistics Agency, ad-
11
ministers such section by operating the Law En-
12
forcement Support Office program. 
13
(2) New and used material, including mine-re-
14
sistant ambush-protected vehicles and weapons de-
15
termined by the Department of Defense to be ‘‘mili-
16
tary grade’’ are transferred to Federal, Tribal, 
17
State, and local law enforcement agencies through 
18
the program. 
19
(3) As a result local law enforcement agencies, 
20
including police and sheriff’s departments, are ac-
21
quiring this material for use in their normal oper-
22
ations. 
23

•HR 1694 IH
(4) As a result of the wars in Iraq and Afghani-
1
stan, military equipment purchased for, and used in, 
2
those wars has become excess property and has been 
3
made available for transfer to local and Federal law 
4
enforcement agencies. 
5
(5) In Fiscal Year 2017, $504,000,000 worth 
6
of property was transferred to law enforcement 
7
agencies. 
8
(6) More than $6,800,000,000 worth of weap-
9
ons and equipment have been transferred to police 
10
organizations in all 50 States and four territories 
11
through the program. 
12
(7) In May 2012, the Defense Logistics Agency 
13
instituted a moratorium on weapons transfers 
14
through the program after reports of missing equip-
15
ment and inappropriate weapons transfers. 
16
(8) Though the moratorium was widely pub-
17
licized, it was lifted in October 2013 without ade-
18
quate safeguards. 
19
(9) On January 16, 2015, President Barack 
20
Obama issued Executive Order 13688 to better co-
21
ordinate and regulate the Federal transfer of mili-
22
tary weapons and equipment to State, local, and 
23
Tribal law enforcement agencies. 
24
21:56 May 06, 2021

•HR 1694 IH
(10) In July, 2017, the Government Account-
1
ability Office reported that the program’s internal 
2
controls were inadequate to prevent fraudulent appli-
3
cants’ access to the program. 
4
(11) On August 28, 2017, President Donald 
5
Trump rescinded Executive Order 13688 despite a 
6
July 2017 Government Accountability Office report 
7
finding deficiencies with the administration of the 
8
1033 program. 
9
(12) As a result, Federal, State, and local law 
10
enforcement departments across the country are eli-
11
gible again to acquire free ‘‘military-grade’’ weapons 
12
and equipment that could be used inappropriately 
13
during policing efforts in which people and taxpayers 
14
could be harmed. 
15
(13) The Department of Defense categorizes 
16
equipment eligible for transfer under the 1033 pro-
17
gram as ‘‘controlled’’ and ‘‘un-controlled’’ equip-
18
ment. ‘‘Controlled equipment’’ includes weapons, ex-
19
plosives such as flash-bang grenades, mine-resistant 
20
ambush-protected vehicles, long-range acoustic de-
21
vices, aircraft capable of being modified to carry ar-
22
mament that are combat coded, and silencers, 
23
among other military grade items.
