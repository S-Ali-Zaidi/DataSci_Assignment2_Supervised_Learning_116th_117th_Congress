RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives regard-
ing the boycott of certain companies that continue to 
operate in Russia and provide financial benefits to the

Whereas, on February 24, 2022, the Government of Russia, 
led by Vladimir Putin, invaded the sovereign country of 
Ukraine under the direction of the President of the Rus-
sian Federation Vladimir Putin;

Whereas, as of April 6, 2022, according to the United Na-
tions, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has caused at least 
3,776 civilian casualties and forced more than 4,278,000 
refugees to flee Ukraine, with estimates likely severely 
undercounting the actual toll; 
Whereas, on March 16, 2022, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy 
urged ‘‘All American companies must leave Russia . . . 
leave their market immediately, because it is flooded with 
[Ukrainian] blood’’; 
Whereas in the same speech, President Zelenskyy called on 
Congress to lead by pressuring companies ‘‘who finance 
the Russian military machine’’ and conduct ‘‘business in 
Russia’’ and to ‘‘make sure that the Russians do not re-
ceive a single penny that they use to destroy people in 
Ukraine’’; 
Whereas Jeffrey Sonnenfeld of the Yale School of Manage-
ment has compiled a list of some 600 companies which 
have withdrawn permanently or temporarily from Russia 
as of April 6, 2022; 
Whereas according to the same Yale database, some 33 com-
panies form a ‘‘hall of shame’’ by refusing to exit Russia 
or reduce their business activities there; 
Whereas by refusing to reduce, cease, or withdraw operations 
in Russia, these companies contribute to undermining the 
sanctions imposed by the United States and its allies that 
are intended to deter further Russian aggression; and 
Whereas a number of United States and multinational com-
panies that do business in Russia do not provide life-sav-
ing or health-related goods and services to the Russian 
people and contribute to Putin’s ability to wage war in 
Ukraine and continue to commit war crimes by providing
