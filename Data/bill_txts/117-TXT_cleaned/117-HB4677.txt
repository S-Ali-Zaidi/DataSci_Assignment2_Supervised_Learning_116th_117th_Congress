Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 4677 IH
(1) The New York-New Jersey Watershed, 
1
which encompasses all the watersheds that flow into 
2
New York-New Jersey Harbor and their associated 
3
estuaries, such as the Hudson, Mohawk, Raritan, 
4
Passaic, Hackensack, and Bronx River Watersheds 
5
and the Hudson River Estuary, provide multiple 
6
benefits to diverse stakeholders including regarding 
7
fisheries and wildlife, conservation of natural re-
8
sources and public and private lands, critical urban 
9
greenspaces and quality of life, and conservation of 
10
ocean and coastal resources. 
11
(2) These resources support one of the most 
12
densely populated and economically important re-
13
gions in the country. 
14
(3) Managing this public resource and its many 
15
services requires leadership from the Department of 
16
the Interior and coordination among other Federal 
17
agencies, two States, hundreds of counties, cities 
18
and towns, and millions of property owners. 
19
(4) These ongoing challenges are compounded 
20
by the likely impacts of rising air and water tem-
21
peratures, increases in incidences of extreme weather 
22
from large storms to rainfall, and rising sea levels. 
23
(5) The New York-New Jersey Harbor contrib-
24
utes $8,500,000,000 annually in Federal, State, and

local tax revenue and is directly or indirectly respon-
1
sible for 629,000 jobs with $90,500,000,000 in an-
2
nual personal and business wages. 
3
(6) The New York-New Jersey Watershed sup-
4
ports 
multiple 
industries 
that 
attract 
over 
5
$60,700,000,000 in annual revenue through tour-
6
ism, commercial fishing, and recreational activities. 
7
(7) The Mohawk River’s water resources play 
8
an important role in tourism, shipping, and related 
9
businesses, with tourism alone valued at more than 
10
$1,340,000,000 annually. 
11
(8) Management of the shorelines of the New 
12
York-New Jersey Watershed is critical to flood miti-
13
gation and habitat for fish and wildlife. Further, fol-
14
lowing the loss of life and billions of dollars of dam-
15
ages caused by Hurricanes Sandy, Irene and Lee, 
16
Federal, State, and local governments recognize that 
17
natural and nature-based flood hazard mitigation 
18
measures, including living shorelines and restoring 
19
the function of riparian corridors, are cost-effective 
20
solutions. 
21
(9) Restoration activities in the New York-New 
22
Jersey Watershed are supported through several 
23
Federal and State programs, and funding for those 
24
important programs should continue and com-

plement the establishment of the New York-New 
1
Jersey Watershed Restoration Program, which is in-
2
tended to build on and help coordinate restoration 
3
and protection funding mechanisms at the Federal, 
4
State, regional, and local levels. 
5
(10) Millions of people rely on the Mohawk, 
6
Raritan, and Hackensack Rivers as sources of drink-
7
ing water. 
8
(11) The New York-New Jersey Watershed 
9
supports Federal threatened species and endangered 
10
species, including the shortnose sturgeon and Atlan-
11
tic sturgeon. 
12
(12) Many residents of the region of the New 
13
York-New Jersey Watershed live in communities 
14
lacking in environmental justice, where access to and 
15
enjoyment of fish, wildlife, clean water, and other 
16
natural resources have been impaired or com-
17
promised. 
18
(13) Drawing on existing management plans 
19
and existing and ongoing voluntary conservation ef-
20
forts in the New York-New Jersey Watershed will 
21
improve efficiency and cost-effectiveness, as well as 
22
increase private-sector investments and coordination 
23
of Federal and non-Federal resources.
