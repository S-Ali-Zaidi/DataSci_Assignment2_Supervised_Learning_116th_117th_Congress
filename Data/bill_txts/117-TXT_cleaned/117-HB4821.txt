This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Combating the Perse-
2
cution of Christians in China Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress makes the following findings: 
5
(1) According to the Department of State’s 
6
International Religious Freedom reports, there are 
7
an estimated 12,000,000 Chinese Catholics and 
8
60,000,000 to 80,000,000 Chinese Protestants wor-
9
shiping in both officially registered and unregistered 
10
churches in China. 
11
(2) The practice of Christianity is overseen by 
12
four major entities: Three-Self Patriotic Movement, 
13
the China Christian Council, the Chinese Patriotic 
14
Catholic Association, and the Bishops Conference of 
15
Catholic Church in China. 
16
(3) The activities of state-sanctioned religious 
17
organizations are regulated by the Chinese Com-
18
munist Party, which manages all aspects of religious 
19
life. 
20
(4) The Chinese Communist Party is actively 
21
seeking to control, govern, and manipulate all as-
22
pects of faith through the ‘‘Sinicization of Religion’’, 
23
a process intended to shape religious traditions and 
24
doctrines so they conform with the objectives of the 
25
Chinese Communist Party.

(5) On February 1, 2018, the Chinese govern-
1
ment implemented new religious regulations that im-
2
posed restrictions on Chinese contacts with overseas 
3
religious organizations, required government ap-
4
proval for religious schools, websites, and any online 
5
religious service, and effectively banned unauthorized 
6
religious gatherings and teachings. 
7
(6) Since February 1, 2018, forced closures of 
8
churches, arbitrary detention, and arrest of Chris-
9
tian clergy and practitioners have steadily increased, 
10
including the arrest and 9-year prison sentence of 
11
Pastor Wang Yi of the Early Rain Covenant 
12
Church. 
13
(7) In September 2018, the Holy See an-
14
nounced that a Provisional Agreement on the ap-
15
pointment of bishops had been signed with the Chi-
16
nese government; however, several news sources have 
17
reported that since the agreement was signed Chi-
18
nese authorities have detained clergy, pressured 
19
them to join an ‘‘independent church’’, closed unreg-
20
istered churches, and removed children from church-
21
es. 
22
(8) There are credible reports of Chinese au-
23
thorities raiding house churches, removing crosses, 
24
confiscating religious paraphernalia, installing sur-

veillance cameras on church property, pressuring 
1
churches to sing songs of the Chinese Communist 
2
Party and display the national flag during commu-
3
nity worship, forcing churches to replace images of 
4
Jesus Christ or the Virgin Mary with pictures of 
5
President Xi Jinping, and banning children and stu-
6
dents from attending church services. 
7
(9) It has been reported that China is rewriting 
8
and will issue a version of the Bible with the ‘‘cor-
9
rect understanding’’ of the text according to the Chi-
10
nese Communist Party. 
11
(10) According to the Department of State’s 
12
International Religious Freedom reports, the Chi-
13
nese government has imprisoned thousands of indi-
14
viduals of all faiths for practicing their religious be-
15
liefs and often labels them as ‘‘cults’’. 
16
(11) Prisoners include Pastor Zhang Shaojie, a 
17
Three-Self church pastor from Nanle County in Chi-
18
na’s central Henan was sentenced in July 2014 to 
19
12 years in prison for ‘‘gathering a crowd to disrupt 
20
the public order’’, and Pastor John Cao, a United 
21
States permanent resident from Greensboro, North 
22
Carolina, who was sentenced for 7 years in prison in 
23
March 2018 under contrived charges of organizing 
24
illegal border crossings.

5
ities and Accountability Act of 2015 states that the 
6
United States overall trade negotiating objectives 
7
must ‘‘take into account conditions relating to reli-
8
gious freedom of any party to negotiations for a 
9
trade agreement with the United States’’.

11
United States issued in 2017, 2015, 2006, 2002, 
12
1999, 1998, and 1997, committed the United States

(d) REDESIGNATION OF CHINA AS A COUNTRY OF 
3
PARTICULAR CONCERN.—It is the policy of the United 
4

as defined by the International Religious Freedom Act of 
8
1998 (Public Law 105–292). 
9
(e) INTERNATIONAL MINISTERIAL TO ADVANCE RE-

11
that the Department of State will host once every two 
12
years the Ministerial to Advance Religious Freedom in

SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
19
It is the sense of Congress that the United States 
20
should promote religious freedom in China by— 
21
(1) strengthening religious freedom diplomacy 
22
on behalf of Christians and other religious minorities 
23
facing restrictions in China;

•HR 4821 IH
(2) raising cases relating to religious or political 
1
prisoners at the highest levels with Chinese officials 
2
because experience demonstrates that consistently 
3
raising prisoner cases can result in improved treat-
4
ment, reduced sentences, or in some cases, release 
5
from custody, detention, or imprisonment; 
6
(3) encouraging Members of Congress to 
7
‘‘adopt’’ a prisoner of conscience in China through 
8
the Lantos Human Rights Commission’s ‘‘Defending 
9
Freedom Project’’, raise the case with Chinese offi-
10
cials, and work publicly for their release; 
11
(4) calling on the Chinese Government to un-
12
conditionally release religious and political prisoners 
13
or, at the very least, ensure that detainees are treat-
14
ed humanely with access to family, the lawyer of 
15
their choice, independent medical care, and the abil-
16
ity to practice their faith while in detention; and 
17
(5) encouraging the global faith community to 
18
speak in solidarity with the persecuted religious 
19
groups in China, including Christians.
