A BILL 
To prevent the misuse of drones, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Drone Act of 2022’’. 
4
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
5
Congress finds that— 
6
(1) drone technology has the potential to revo-
7
lutionize commerce, military operations, law enforce-
8
ment, and various industries, as well as recreation in 
9
general;

•HR 7965 IH
(2) drone technology also presents a potential 
1
danger to public safety and national security; 
2
(3) drone technology is increasingly being used 
3
by drug trafficking and human trafficking organiza-
4
tions at the southern border— 
5
(A) to assist in smuggling into the United 
6
States high-value items; 
7
(B) for conducting reconnaissance; and 
8
(C) even as offensive weapons against com-
9
peting criminal organizations; 
10
(4) drone technology has been used to deliver 
11
into Federal correctional centers contraband such as 
12
cell phones, wire cutters, screwdrivers, and hack-
13
saws; 
14
(5) there were 875 drone sightings in restricted 
15
airport airspace in 2020, and 766 such sightings in 
16
the first half of 2021, including 36 such sightings in 
17
the vicinities of runways; and 
18
(6) while existing Federal law includes some 
19
criminal provisions relating to misuse of drones, 
20
those provisions are fragmentary in nature and 
21
therefore fail to restrain and deter the most serious 
22
drone-related crimes.
