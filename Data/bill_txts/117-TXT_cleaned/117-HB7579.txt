(1) Our neighbors in the Western Hemisphere 
1
play a vital role in ensuring peace, security, and de-
2
mocracy. 
3
(2) Instability and lack of economic opportuni-
4
ties in the region are major drivers of migration in 
5
violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act. 
6
(3) According to the United States Census Bu-
7
reau, in 2021 the United States exported $174.62

and imported $121 billion. 
10
(4) The United States is a net exporter with

Central and South America.

14
stability to the region. 
15
(6) There is significant opportunity to expand 
16
the free flow of goods and services in the Western 
17
Hemisphere. 
18
(7) Closer relations among the Americas 
19
through free trade agreements and trade liberaliza-
20
tion would encourage further economic development 
21
and stability in the region. 
22
(8) The United States should exercise its influ-
23
ence to encourage privatization, free markets, and 
24
economic cooperation in the region.

(9) Countries in the region should combat cor-
1
ruption, strengthen the rule of law, reduce bureau-
2
cratic red tape, streamline permitting, and embrace 
3
free market principles to encourage further private 
4
sector investment. 
5
(10) With cooperation from the United States, 
6
regional countries must take serious steps to curb 
7
migration in violation of the Immigration and Na-
8
tionality Act. 
9
(11) The Western Hemisphere has supply 
10
chains that are vulnerable due to their over depend-
11
ence on the People’s Republic of China. 
12
(12) Free trade and expanded commercial ties 
13
between the United States and Western Hemisphere 
14
partners will foster economic and commercial co-
15
operation, increase investment opportunities, de-
16
crease migration in violation of the Immigration and 
17
Nationality Act, reduce our dependence on the Peo-
18
ple’s Republic of China, and create jobs for Amer-
19
