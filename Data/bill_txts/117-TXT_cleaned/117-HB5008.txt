A BILL 
To protect the voting rights of Native American and Alaska 
Native voters. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. 
7
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
8
00:29 Aug 14, 2021
H5008
2 
•HR 5008 IH
(1) The Constitution explicitly and implicitly 
1
grants Congress broad general powers to legislate on 
2
issues relating to Indian Tribes, powers consistently 
3
described as plenary and exclusive. These powers 
4
arise from the grant of authority in the Indian Com-
5
merce Clause and through legislative matters arising 
6
under the Treaty Clause. 
7
(2) The Federal Government is responsible for 
8
upholding the obligations to which the Federal Gov-
9
ernment has agreed through treaties, legislation, and 
10
executive orders, referred to as the Federal trust re-
11
sponsibility toward Indian Tribes and their mem-
12
bers. 
13
(3) The Supreme Court has repeatedly relied on 
14
the nature of this ‘‘government to government’’ rela-
15
tionship between the United States and sovereign 
16
Indian Tribes for congressional authority to enact 
17
‘‘legislation that singles out Indians for particular 
18
and special treatment’’. Morton v. Mancari, 417 
19
U.S. 535, 554–555 (1974). 
20
(4) Legislation removing barriers to Native 
21
American voting is vital for the fulfillment of Con-
22
gress’ ‘‘unique obligation’’ toward Indians, particu-
23
larly ensuring that Native American voters are fully 
24
included as ‘‘qualified members of the modern body

politic’’. Board of County Comm’rs v. Seber, 318 
1
U.S. 705, 715 (1943). 
2
(5) Under the Elections Clause of article I, sec-
3
tion 4 of the Constitution, Congress has additional 
4
power to regulate any election conducted to select 
5
Members of Congress. Taken together, the Indian 
6
Commerce Clause and the Election Clause give Con-
7
gress broad authority to enact legislation to safe-
8
guard the voting rights of Native American voters. 
9
(6) Despite Congress’ decision to grant Native 
10
Americans Federal citizenship, and with it the pro-
11
tections of the Fifteenth Amendment, with passage 
12
of the Act of June 2, 1924 (Chapter 233; 43 Stat. 
13
253) (commonly known as the ‘‘Indian Citizenship 
14
Act of 1924’’), States continued to deploy distinct 
15
methods for disenfranchising Indians by enacting 
16
statutes to exclude from voter rolls Indians living on 
17
Indian lands, requiring that Indians first terminate 
18
their relationship with their Indian Tribe, restricting 
19
the right to vote on account of a Tribal member’s 
20
‘‘guardianship’’ status, and imposing literacy tests. 
21
(7) Barriers to voter access for Native Ameri-
22
cans persist today, and such barriers range from ob-
23
structing voter access to vote dilution and inten-
24
tional malapportionment of electoral districts.

(8) The Native American Voting Rights Coali-
1
tion’s nine field hearings in Indian Country and 
2
four-State survey of voter discrimination revealed a 
3
number of additional obstacles that Native Ameri-
4
cans must overcome in some States, including— 
5
(A) a lack of accessible registration and 
6
polling sites, either due to conditions such as 
7
geography, lack of paved roads, the absence of 
8
reliable and affordable broadband connectivity, 
9
and restrictions on the time, place, and manner 
10
that eligible people can register and vote, in-
11
cluding unequal opportunities for absentee, 
12
early, mail-in, and in-person voting; 
13
(B) nontraditional or nonexistent addresses 
14
for residents on Indian reservations, lack of res-
15
idential mail delivery and pick up, reliance on 
16
distant post offices with abbreviated operating 
17
hours for mail services, insufficient housing 
18
units, overcrowded homes, and high incidence of 
19
housing insecurity and homelessness, lack of ac-
20
cess to vehicles, and disproportionate poverty 
21
which make voter registration, acquisition and 
22
dropping off of mail-in ballots, receipt of voting 
23
information and materials, and securing re-
24
quired identification difficult, if not impossible; 
25
00:29 Aug 14, 2021
H5008

•HR 5008 IH
(C) inadequate language assistance for 
1
Tribal members, including lack of outreach and 
2
publicity, the failure to provide complete, accu-
3
rate, and uniform translations of all voting ma-
4
terials in the relevant Native language, and an 
5
insufficient number of trained bilingual poll 
6
workers; and 
7
(D) voter identification laws that discrimi-
8
nate against Native Americans. 
9
(9) The Department of Justice and courts also 
10
recognized that some jurisdictions have been unre-
11
sponsive to reasonable requests from federally recog-
12
nized Indian Tribes for more accessible voter reg-
13
istration sites and in-person voting locations. 
14
(10) According to the National Congress of 
15
American Indians, there is a wide gap between the 
16
voter registration and turnout rates of eligible Amer-
17
ican Indians and Alaska Natives and the voter reg-
18
istration and turnout rates of non-Hispanic White 
19
and other racial and ethnic groups. 
20
(11) Despite these obstacles, the Native-Amer-
21
ican vote continues to play a significant role in Fed-
22
eral, State, and local elections. 
23
(12) In Alaska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and 
24
South Dakota, Native Americans, American Indians, 
25

and Alaska Natives comprise approximately 10 per-
1
cent or more of the voting population. 
2
(13) The Native-American vote also holds great 
3
potential, with over 1,000,000 voters who are eligible 
4
to vote, but are not registered to vote. 
5
(b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this Act are— 
6
(1) to fulfill the Federal Government’s trust re-
7
sponsibility to protect and promote Native-Ameri-
8
cans’ exercise of their constitutionally guaranteed 
9
right to vote, including the right to register to vote 
10
and the ability to access all mechanisms for voting; 
11
(2) to establish Tribal administrative review 
12
procedures for a specific subset of State actions that 
13
have been used to restrict access to the polls on In-
14
dian lands; 
15
(3) to expand voter registration under the Na-
16
tional Voter Registration Act of 1993 (52 U.S.C. 
17
20501 et seq.) to cover Federal facilities; 
18
(4) to afford equal treatment to forms of identi-
19
fication unique to Indian Tribes and their members; 
20
(5) to ensure American Indians and Alaska Na-
21
tives experiencing homelessness, housing insecurity, 
22
or lacking residential mail pickup and delivery can 
23
pool resources to pick up and return ballots;

3
Alaska Natives under section 203 of the Voting 
4
Rights Act of 1965 (52 U.S.C. 10503);

(8) to study the prevalence of nontraditional or

nonexistent mailing addresses in Native communities

and identify solutions to voter access that arise from
