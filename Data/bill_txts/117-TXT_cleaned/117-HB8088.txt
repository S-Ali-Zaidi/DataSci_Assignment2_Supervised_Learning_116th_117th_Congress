SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
3
Congress makes the following findings: 
4
(1) India is the second most populous country 
5
in the world with a population of approximately 
6
1,334,000,000 people and is the fifth largest econ-
7
omy in the world with a nominal gross domestic 
8
product of approximately $2,940,000,000,000. 
9
(2) India is among the countries most vulner-
10
able to climate change, with hundreds of millions of 
11
people susceptible to events exacerbated by climate 
12
change, such as the spread of infectious diseases, sea 
13
level rise and extreme flooding, droughts, storms, 
14
and landslides triggered by extreme weather. 
15
(3) India releases approximately 2,500,000,000 
16
tons (carbon dioxide equivalent) of greenhouse gases 
17

annually, making it the third largest greenhouse gas 
1
emitter after the People’s Republic of China and the 
2
United States. 
3
(4) India is one of the largest energy markets 
4
in the world and is projected to be the largest source 
5
of global energy demand growth through 2040. In-
6
stalled power capacity in India more than doubled 
7
between 2011 and 2021. 
8
(5) Per capita energy consumption in India is 
9
relatively low among emerging economic powers. 
10
(6) Reliable access to power is crucial for the 
11
storage of vaccines and antiretroviral and other life-
12
saving medical drugs, as well as for the operation of 
13
modern lifesaving medical equipment. 
14
(7) Access to power can also provide improved 
15
information and communication technologies that 
16
can greatly improve health and education outcomes, 
17
as well as economic and commercial opportunities. 
18
(8) In 2000, only 43 percent of the population 
19
of India had access to power. That percentage more 
20
than doubled between 2000 and 2020, with approxi-
21
mately 700,000,000 people in India gaining access 
22
to electricity during that period.

(9) 
Prime 
Minister 
Narendra 
Modi 
has 
1
prioritized improving citizen access to electricity and 
2
electrifying every household in India. 
3
(10) The Power for All initiative of the Govern-
4
ment of India aims to provide electricity to all 
5
households in India 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. 
6
(11) Without action, climate change threatens 
7
to push millions more people into poverty. Invest-
8
ments in clean energy offer an opportunity to curb 
9
climate change while combating poverty and increas-
10
ing capacity to respond to the impacts of climate 
11
change. 
12
(12) As of June 2020, coal makes up the larg-
13
est domestic source of energy supply and electricity 
14
generation for India. In October 2020, the Ministry 
15
of New and Renewable Energy reported that renew-
16
able energy comprises approximately 12 percent of 
17
energy generation in India. 
18
(13) India imports 80 percent of its oil needs, 
19
and that amount is projected to increase in the com-
20
ing decades due to aging oil fields and a lack of new 
21
oil discoveries in India. India is increasing its oil re-
22
fining capacity to maintain supply to meet the rising 
23
domestic demand for energy. 
24

(14) India is projected to surpass the People’s 
1
Republic of China in oil consumption by 2030. 
2
(15) On September 22, 2020, the People’s Re-
3
public of China announced a pledge to achieve net 
4
zero carbon emissions by 2060 in its updated Na-
5
tionally Determined Contribution to the Paris Agree-
6
ment, done at Paris December 12, 2015, but given 
7
the need to accelerate the reduction of global emis-
8
sions along a 2050 timeline, that pledge is insuffi-
9
cient to avoid an increase of 2 degrees Celsius in the 
10
global average temperature. 
11
(16) India, in contrast, is demonstrating that 
12
climate action is a priority through concrete steps 
13
including a climate plan compatible with the goal of 
14
limiting global average temperature rise below 2 de-
15
grees Celsius. 
16
(17) India’s unconditional emissions target, as 
17
outlined in the Intended Nationally Determined Con-
18
tribution of India to the Paris Agreement, aims to 
19
reduce emissions intensity of gross domestic product 
20
by 33 percent to 35 percent below 2005 levels by 
21
2030. 
22
(18) In its Intended Nationally Determined 
23
Contribution, India has also pledged to increase the 
24
share of its installed electricity capacity that comes

create 
an 
additional 
2,500,000,000

2
3,000,000,000 tons of carbon sinks. 
3
(19) In 2019, Prime Minister Modi announced 
4
an ambitious domestic target of installing 450 
5
gigawatts of renewable energy capacity by 2030. 
6
(20) India is among the top 5 clean energy pro-
7
ducers globally. Installed electricity capacity from re-
8
newables in India grew by 144 percent from 2014 to 
9
2020, and between 2014 and 2019 there was ap-
10
proximately $42,000,000,000 in investment in the 
11
renewable energy sector in India. 
12
(21) Numerous global funds, private equity 
13
firms, and multilateral finance institutions are con-
14
tinuing to invest billions of dollars in the growing re-
15
newable energy sector in India. 
16
(22) India leads the International Solar Alli-
17
ance, a 75-country initiative to which the United 
18
States 
does 
not 
yet 
belong, 
to 
mobilize 
19
$1,000,000,000,000 in solar energy investment by 
20
2030. 
21
(23) Increased ownership of appliances and 
22
cooling needs could lead to a doubling or even tri-
23
pling of energy use in India by 2040. One billion air

(24) Under the Kigali Amendment to the Mon-
3
treal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone 
4
Layer, done at Montreal September 16, 1987, India 
5
has agreed to freeze its manufacturing and con-
6
sumption of hydrofluorocarbons in 2028. 
7
(25) In 2005, the United States and India es-
8
tablished a formal energy cooperation dialogue, the 
9
United States-India Energy Dialogue, which in-
10
cluded engagement on clean, low carbon tech-
11
nologies. In 2009, the United States and India ex-
12
panded the United States-India Energy Dialogue to 
13
advance clean and sustainable energy development. 
14
The expansion in 2009 included the Partnership to 
15

16

17

development, 
and

14

15
(29) In 2015, the United States and India 
16
launched the U.S.-India Clean Energy Finance Task 
17
Force, which draws on the finance expertise of the 
18
governments and private sectors of both countries to 
19
tailor business and finance models to scale India’s 
20
clean energy sector.

22

2
(31) In 2018, the United States Government 
3
established the Asia Enhancing Development and 
4
Growth through Energy initiative, commonly re-
5
ferred to as ‘‘Asia EDGE’’, to support sustainable 
6
and secure energy markets throughout the Indo-Pa-
7
cific. Asia EDGE integrates elements of the Part-
8
nership to Advance Clean Energy initiative along 
9
with new programs such as the South Asia Group 
10
for Energy. 
11
(32) In 2018, the Governments of India and 
12
the United States elevated the energy partnership to 
13
the U.S.-India Strategic Energy Partnership to ad-
14
vance energy security, expand energy innovation, 
15
and increase stakeholder engagement. That partner-
16
ship included pillars of cooperation on power and en-
17
ergy 
efficiency, 
renewable 
energy, 
sustainable 
18
growth, and oil and gas. The Governments of India 
19
and the United States also continued clean energy 
20
research and development under the Partnership to 
21
Advance Clean Energy Research. 
22
(33) In 2021, the United States Government,

(34) In 2021, at the Leaders Summit on Cli-
5

6
U.S.-India Climate and Clean Energy Agenda 2030 
7
Partnership to mobilize finance toward and accel-
8
erate clean energy deployment, demonstrate and 
9
scale innovative clean technologies, and build capac-
10

11
climate-related impacts. The Partnership has two 
12
main tracks, the Strategic Clean Energy Partnership 
13
(led by the Department of Energy) and the Climate 
14
Action and Finance Mobilization Dialogue (led by 
15
the Office of the Special Presidential Envoy for Cli-
