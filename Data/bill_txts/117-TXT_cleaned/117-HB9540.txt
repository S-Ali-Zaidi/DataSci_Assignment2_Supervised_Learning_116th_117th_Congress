SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Legacies of War Rec-
2
ognition and Unexploded Ordnance Removal Act’’.

SEC. 2. RECOGNITION OF THE COMMUNITIES WHO SUP-
4
AND 
DEFENDED 
THE 
ARMED 
5
FORCES IN SOUTHEAST ASIA.

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) During the conflict in Southeast Asia dur-
8
ing the 1960s and 1970s, many Hmong, Cham, 
9
Cambodians, Iu-Mien, Khmu, Lao, Montagnard, and 
10
Vietnamese people— 
11
(A) fought and died with the Armed 
12
Forces; 
13
(B) rescued United States pilots shot down 
14
in enemy-controlled territory and returned the 
15
pilots to safety; 
16
(C) gathered and provided intelligence to 
17
the Armed Forces about enemy troop positions, 
18
movement, and strength; and 
19
(D) provided food, shelter, and support to 
20
members of the Armed Forces. 
21
(2) The national armed forces of Cambodia fa-
22
cilitated the evacuation of the United States Em-
23
bassy in Phnom Penh on April 12, 1975, by fighting 
24
Khmer Rouge forces that advanced upon the capital.

(3) A tragic legacy of the conflict in Southeast 
1
Asia is the lethal risk posed by landmines, 
2
unexploded ordnance (in this Act, referred to as 
3
‘‘UXO’’), and explosive remnants of war in Vietnam, 
4
Laos, and Cambodia that still litter forests, rice 
5
fields, villages, school grounds, roads, and other pop-
6
ulated areas, hindering development and efforts to 
7
reduce poverty. 
8
(4) Vietnam remains one of the world’s most 
9
contaminated countries, with an estimated 800,000 
10
tons of UXO left over from the conflict in Southeast 
11
Asia that ended more than 40 years ago. Since 
12
1975, UXO accidents have caused more than 
13
105,000 casualties, including more than 38,000 
14
deaths of Vietnamese civilians. 
15
(5) In Laos, much of the country’s land re-
16
mains contaminated with tens of millions of small, 
17
unexploded cluster munitions. Since 1964, UXO and 
18
other explosive remnants of war have injured or 
19
killed more than 50,000 civilians in Laos. 
20
(6) Cambodia has experienced one of the high-
21
est rates of landmine and UXO casualties in the 
22
world. Over 64,000 Cambodians have been injured 
23
or killed by landmines, UXO, or other explosive rem-
24
nants of war since 1979.

(7) The United States is the world’s leading fi-
1
nancial supporter of demining and programs to re-
2
move UXO. Since 1993, the United States has pro-
3
vided more than $3,700,000,000 in assistance to lo-
4
cate and destroy UXO and other explosive remnants 
5
of war in more than 100 countries, including more 
6
than $148,000,000 in Vietnam, $230,000,000 in 
7
Laos, and $154,000,000 in Cambodia.

(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
9
gress that— 
10
(1) the Hmong, Cham, Cambodian, Iu-Mien, 
11
Khmu, Lao, Montagnard, and Vietnamese people de-
12
serve recognition for their support and defense of 
13
the Armed Forces during the conflict in Southeast 
14
Asia; and 
15
(2) the United States should continue to sup-
16
port activities to clear landmines, UXO, and other 
17
explosive remnants of war in Vietnam, Laos, and 
18
Cambodia, while strengthening people-to-people ties 
19
and reaffirming the long-standing commitment of 
20
the United States to Southeast Asia.
