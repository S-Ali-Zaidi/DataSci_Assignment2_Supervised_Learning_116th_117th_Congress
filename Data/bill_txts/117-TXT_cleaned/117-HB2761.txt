A BILL 
To establish a national mercury monitoring program, and 
for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Comprehensive Na-
4
tional Mercury Monitoring Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds that— 
7
(1) mercury is a potent neurotoxin of signifi-
8
cant ecological and public health concern;

•HR 2761 IH
(2) it is estimated that approximately 200,000 
1
children born each year in the United States are ex-
2
posed to levels of mercury in the womb that are high 
3
enough to impair neurological development; 
4
(3) based on estimates from the Centers for 
5
Disease Control and Prevention, between 2000 and 
6
2010, between 2 and 6 percent of women in the 
7
United States of childbearing age have exceeded 
8
blood mercury levels determined to be safe by the 
9
Environmental Protection Agency; 
10
(4) exposure to mercury occurs largely by the 
11
consumption of contaminated fish, but fish and 
12
shellfish are important sources of dietary protein 
13
and micronutrients, and a healthy fishing resource is 
14
important to the economy of the United States; 
15
(5) in many locations, the primary route for 
16
mercury input to aquatic ecosystems is atmospheric 
17
emissions, transport, and deposition; 
18
(6) existing broad-scale data sets are important 
19
but insufficient to track changes in mercury levels in 
20
the environment over time, test model predictions, 
21
and assess the impact of changing mercury emis-
22
sions and deposition; and 
23
(7) a comprehensive national mercury moni-
24
toring network to accurately quantify regional and 
25

•HR 2761 IH
national changes in atmospheric mercury deposition, 
1
ecosystem contamination, and bioaccumulation of 
2
mercury in fish and wildlife in response to changes 
3
in mercury emissions would help policy makers, sci-
4
entists, and the public to better understand the 
5
sources, consequences, and trends of mercury pollu-
6
tion in the United States.
