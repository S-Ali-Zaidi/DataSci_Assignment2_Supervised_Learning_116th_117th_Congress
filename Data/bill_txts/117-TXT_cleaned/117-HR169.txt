RESOLUTION 
Commending the officers of the United States Capitol Police 
Department, the Metropolitan Police Department of 
Washington, DC, and other law enforcement personnel 
for their selfless and heroic service in defense of Amer-
ican democracy in responding to the assault on the 
United States Capitol by domestic terrorists on January 
6, 2021. 
Whereas the United States Capitol Police dates back to 1800 
when Congress moved from Philadelphia to Washington,

DC, and a lone watchman was hired to protect the Cap-
itol Building; 
Whereas, in 1827, President John Quincy Adams asked that 
a regular Capitol police force be established and on May 
2, 1828, Congress passed an Act that expanded the po-
lice regulations of the city of Washington, DC, to include 
the Capitol and Capitol Square; 
Whereas the United States Capitol Police expanded its force 
after the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, and 
again following the historic merger with the Library of 
Congress Police in 2009; 
Whereas in addition to the more than 2,000 sworn members 
of the force, the United States Capitol Police Department 
has over 350 civilian personnel who provide operational 
and administrative support and its diverse workforce is 
comprised of employees from nearly all 50 States and the 
United States territories; 
Whereas the United States Capitol Police embodies the best 
in American policing and serve as a model in security, 
urban crime prevention, dignitary protection, specialty re-
sponse capabilities, and homeland security; 
Whereas as ambassadors of Congress, officers of the United 
States Capitol Police Department are often the first face 
that visitors and employees encounter, leaving a lasting 
impression that is reflective of the legislative branch and 
its role in America’s democracy; 
Whereas officers of the United States Capitol Police Depart-
ment each day proudly protect the legislative process, the 
symbol of the Nation’s democracy, the people who carry 
out the process, and the millions of visitors who travel 
here to see democracy in action;

Whereas there is no finer example of the selfless devotion to 
duty, love of country, and fidelity to their oath to pre-
serve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the officers 
of the United States Capitol Police Department’s than 
their valiant, heroic, and courageous response to the as-
sault on the Capitol Building by thousands of domestic 
terrorists, insurrectionists, and rioters sent there by then- 
President of the United States to ‘‘fight like hell’’ to dis-
rupt and derail the constitutionally required Joint Meet-
ing of Congress to open, count, and publicly confirm the 
vote tally of the Presidential electors and announce the 
persons who had been elected President and Vice Presi-
dent of the United States on January 6, 2021; 
Whereas the District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser and 
the Metropolitan Police Department have a distinguished 
record of protecting all groups, regardless of their beliefs, 
who come to the Nation’s capital to exercise their First 
Amendment rights peaceably to assemble, and to petition 
the Government for a redress of grievances; 
Whereas at the direction of Mayor Bowser, and in advance 
of the scheduled demonstrations, mutual aid was re-
quested by the Metropolitan Police Department from sev-
eral area police departments to be on standby in the Dis-
trict, including neighboring law enforcement departments, 
the Metropolitan Transit Police and non-law enforcement 
agencies such as the District’s Homeland Security and 
Emergency Management Agency and the Fire and Emer-
gency Medical Services Department; 
Whereas the sustained assault on the Capitol precipitated an 
equally unprecedented response, necessitating the urgent 
request of the United States Capitol Police for the Metro-
politan Police Department to come defend the Capitol to

which the Metropolitan Police Department responded im-
mediately with several Civil Disturbance Unit Platoons 
and proceeded to deploy to the west front of the Capitol 
and arrived within minutes; 
Whereas the violent mob overran protective measures at the 
Capitol and by 1:50 p.m., the Metropolitan Police De-
partment had declared the assembly to be a riot and im-
mediately began working to achieve the objectives of stop-
ping domestic terrorists from entering the Capitol Build-
ing and removing those that were already inside, secure 
a perimeter so that the Capitol could be cleared for law-
makers to resume the Joint Meeting of Congress to dem-
onstrate to the Nation and the world the robustness and 
vitality of America’s democracy, and making arrests of 
anyone violating the law; 
Whereas during the height of the siege of the Capitol, ap-
proximately 850 Metropolitan Police Department mem-
bers were at the Capitol, with another 250 in the area 
to directly support the response and aftermath; 
Whereas people around the country and the world were 
shocked and moved by the video of a Metropolitan Police 
Department officer being beaten by a crowd of insur-
gents, including one wielding an American flag, and of 
another in agony as he was crushed between a door and 
a riot shield but also awed by their bravery in the face 
of this unprovoked and vicious attack, bravery that was 
matched that day by countless other unheralded Metro-
politan Police Department officers; 
Whereas the siege on the Capitol resulted in one of the worst 
days of injuries for law enforcement in the United States 
since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks;

Whereas officers of the United States Capitol Police Depart-
ment, the Metropolitan Police Department of Wash-
ington, DC, and other uniformed law enforcement offi-
cers stood their ground in defense of American democ-
racy while being attacked by the angry mob of domestic 
terrorists with metal pipes, discharged chemical irritants, 
and other weapons; 
Whereas at least 138 officers, 73 from the United States 
Capitol Police Department, and 65 from the Metropolitan 
Police Department of Washington DC, sustained injuries 
during the attack on the Capitol Building, several of 
whom required hospitalization; 
Whereas the injuries sustained ranged from bruises and lac-
erations to more serious damage such as concussions, rib 
fractures, burns, and even a mild heart attack; 
Whereas one United States Capitol Police Department officer 
died from injuries sustained while physically engaging 
with protesters and two officers involved in the response 
have died by suicide; 
Whereas dozens, if not hundreds, of officers whom law en-
forcement officials estimate will suffer in years to come 
from post-traumatic stress disorder as will the dozens of 
law enforcement officers who contracted the coronavirus 
from the unmasked domestic terrorists and rioters who 
stormed the Capitol; 
Whereas at least 38 Capitol Police officers have tested posi-
tive or were exposed to the coronavirus as were nearly 
200 National Guard personnel who were deployed to pro-
tect the Capitol; 
Whereas the seven hours between the urgent call for help 
from the Capitol Police to the Metropolitan Police De-

partment and the resumption of work by both Houses of 
Congress will be indelibly etched in the memories of every 
law enforcement officer who was on the scene, as it is in 
the minds of the Senators, Representatives, congressional 
and support staff, and members of the media corps who 
were forced to seek safety behind locked doors; and 
Whereas despite being overwhelmed and outnumbered, the in-
domitable forces of American democracy, symbolized by 
the resolve of the officers of the United States Capitol 
Police Department, prevailed and the seditious attack 
was quelled, the Capitol Building preserved, and the lives 
of Senators and Representatives protected, as well as 
those of congressional and support staff, and order was 
restored so that the Joint Meeting of Congress resumed 
and timely completed its constitutionally required duty of 
counting and announcing the votes of the Presidential 
electors, an essential step in the peaceful transfer of 
power that has been a hallmark of American democracy 
and an example to the world for more than two centuries: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
