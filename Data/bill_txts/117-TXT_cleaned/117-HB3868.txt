Congress finds as follows: 
2
(1) In December 2019, reports began circu-
3
lating that hospitals in Wuhan, China were seeing 
4
cases of a pneumonia-like respiratory illness of un-
5
known origins.

(2) On December 31, 2019, an automated 
1
translation of a Chinese media report about a novel 
2
respiratory outbreak was posted to ProMED, one of 
3
the largest public emerging disease and outbreak re-
4
porting systems used to promote communication 
5
among infectious disease specialists, including sci-
6
entists, physicians, veterinarians, epidemiologists, 
7
and public health professionals. 
8
(3) The ProMED posting prompted the World 
9
Health Organization (WHO) to instruct its China 
10
Country Office to request verification of the out-
11
break from the communist government of the Peo-
12
ple’s Republic of China. 
13
(4) In response to the WHO-prompted inquiry, 
14
the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued its 
15
first public statement on the outbreak, saying it had 
16
identified 27 cases. 
17
(5) On January 3, 2020, in what is clear con-
18
duct by the Chinese government to cover up the ori-
19
gins and dangers posed by the outbreak, Dr. Li 
20
Wenliang, a physician at Wuhan Central Hospital, 
21
was reprimanded by local police in the Public Secu-
22
rity Bureau for spreading allegedly ‘‘false state-
23
ments’’ about the outbreak online.

•HR 3868 IH
(6) On January 3, 2020, the Chinese Center for 
1
Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) Direc-
2
tor-General Gao Fu told the United States Centers 
3
for Disease Control and Prevention (United States 
4
CDC) Director Robert Redfield about a pneumonia 
5
outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. 
6
(7) On January 6, 2020, the United States De-
7
partment of Health and Human Services (HHS) 
8
Secretary Alex M. Azar II and United States CDC 
9
Director Redfield offered to send United States 
10
CDC experts to China, and United States CDC 
11
issued a ‘‘Watch Level 1 Alert’’ for Wuhan, meaning 
12
that the CDC recognized a heightened risk for trav-
13
elers, cautioning travelers to use health precautions 
14
when traveling to areas in China. 
15
(8) On January 11, 2020, a team led by Pro-
16
fessor Yong-zhen Zhang of Fudan University in 
17
Shanghai posted the genetic sequence of the novel 
18
virus on an open-access platform, sharing it with the 
19
world. 
20
(9) On January 14, 2020, the WHO tweeted, 
21
‘‘Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chi-
22
nese authorities have found no clear evidence of

China’’. The WHO’s assertion has been proven false 
1
and completely contrary to medical science given 
2
that there have been nearly 163,000,000 cases of in-
3
fection worldwide, resulting in more than 3,380,000 
4
deaths. 
5
(10) On January 20, 2020, China confirmed 
6
person-to-person 
transmission 
of 
the 
novel 
7
coronavirus and infections among medical workers. 
8
(11) On January 21, 2020, the United States 
9
CDC announced the first COVID–19 case in the 
10
United States. 
11
(12) On January 30, 2020, WHO Director- 
12
General Tedros declared the epidemic a Public 
13
Health Emergency of International Concern, and 
14
President Donald J. Trump announced the forma-
15
tion of the President’s Coronavirus Task Force. In 
16
a statement from the WHO regarding the second 
17
meeting of its International Health Regulations 
18
(2005) Emergency Committee regarding the out-
19
break of novel coronavirus (2019–nCoV), the Com-
20
mittee specifically did ‘‘not recommend any travel or 
21
trade restriction based on the current information 
22
available’’. 
23
(13) On January 31, 2020, President Trump 
24
suspended entry into the United States of most for-

eigners who were physically present in mainland 
1
China during the preceding 14-day period, effective 
2
February 2, 2020, and Secretary Azar declared a 
3
public health emergency for the United States to aid 
4
response to the novel coronavirus. 
5
(14) On February 1, 2020, then-presidential 
6
candidate Joe Biden recklessly downplayed the risk 
7
of the virus, suggesting in a tweet that President 
8
Trump’s efforts to limit the spread of the virus were 
9
nothing more than ‘‘hysteria, xenophobia, and fear- 
10
mongering’’. 
11
(15) Numerous individuals criticized these trav-
12
el restrictions. When asked ‘‘if you had to, would 
13
you close down the borders?’’ to stop the spread of 
14
coronavirus, Senator Bernie Sanders said, ‘‘no’’. 
15
When asked about these travel restrictions, Rep-
16
resentative Nancy Pelosi stated, ‘‘[a]ctually tens of 
17
thousands of people were allowed in from China, it 
18
wasn’t as it was described as this great moment’’. 
19
WHO 
Director-General 
Tedros 
Adhanom 
20
Ghebreyesus was reported to say that widespread 
21
travel bans and restrictions were not needed to stop 
22
the outbreak and could ‘‘have the effect of increas-
23
ing fear and stigma, with little public health ben-
24
efit’’. Reportedly, Representative Ami Bera stated 
25
04:29 Jul 14, 2021
H3868
7 
•HR 3868 IH
that the travel ban ‘‘probably doesn’t make sense’’ 
1
since the outbreak had already spread to several 
2
other countries, that such measures were causing an 
3
antagonistic relationship with the Chinese, and such 
4
mandatory quarantines ‘‘may be overkill’’. 
5
(16) Health experts have since noted that the 
6
early United States restrictions imposed on travelers 
7
from China saved American lives. Former CDC di-
8
rector Dr. Tom Frieden noted that ‘‘[t]he travel ban 
9
with China made a difference . . . It resulted in a 
10
significant delay in the number of people coming in 
11
with infection and because of that, that bought time 
12
in the U.S. to better prepare.’’. While testifying be-
13
fore the House of Representatives, Dr. Anthony 
14
Fauci was asked if he believed that the travel re-
15
strictions saved lives, to which Dr. Fauci answered, 
16
‘‘yes, I do’’. 
17
(17) On February 26, 2020, United States 
18
CDC confirmed a case of COVID–19 in California 
19
in a person who reportedly did not have relevant 
20
travel history or exposure to another known patient 
21
with COVID–19. 
22
(18) On February 29, 2020, United States 
23
CDC reported the first COVID–19 death in United 
24
States, though later public reports indicated that the

•HR 3868 IH
first death from COVID–19 may have been weeks 
1
earlier. 
2
(19) In a 60 Minutes interview posted on 
3
March 8, 2020, Dr. Anthony Fauci stated that 
4
‘‘right now in the United States, people should not 
5
be walking around with masks . . . there’s no rea-
6
son to be walking around with a mask. When you’re 
7
in the middle of an outbreak wearing a mask might 
8
make people feel a little bit better, and it might even 
9
block a droplet, but it’s not providing the perfect 
10
protection that people think that it is. And often, 
11
there are unintended consequences, people keep fid-
12
dling with the masks, and they keep touching their 
13
face . . . But, when you think masks, you should 
14
think of healthcare providers needing them and peo-
15
ple who are ill. The people who, when you look at 
16
the films of foreign countries and you see eight-five 
17
percent of the people wearing masks, that’s fine. 
18
That’s fine. I’m not against it. If you want to do it, 
19
that’s fine . . . It could lead to a shortage of masks 
20
for the people who really need it.’’. 
21
(20) On April 3, 2020, United States CDC up-
22
dated its guidance on facial coverings, recom-
23
mending that Americans wear facial coverings in

public settings and especially when social distancing 
1
measures are difficult to maintain. 
2
(21) On May 15, 2020, the Trump administra-
3
tion announced the establishment of Operation Warp 
4
Speed, a public-private partnership to expedite the 
5
timeline for development, large scale manufacturing, 
6
and delivery of a safe and effective COVID–19 vac-
7
cine to the American public. The initial goal of the 
8
project was to develop at least 1 vaccine and begin 
9
administering it to Americans before the end of 
10
2020. As reported on BioCentury, Dr. Anthony 
11
Fauci noted that the fastest a vaccine might be 
12
ready for use in an emergency would be 1 year, al-
13
though the process could take up to 2 years. Before 
14
the Senate on March 3, 2020, Dr. Fauci stated that 
15
the process would likely take at least 1 to 11⁄2 years 
16
to have a vaccine that could be administered to 
17
American persons. Some, such as the analytics firm 
18
Clarivate, concluded that it might take at least 5 
19
years for the leading vaccine candidates, like 
20
Moderna, to complete the development process 
21
through full regulatory approval. 
22
(22) Operation Warp Speed and other govern-
23
ment actions sped COVID–19 vaccine development 
24
by enabling typical vaccine development steps to be 
25
04:29 Jul 14, 2021
H3868
10 
•HR 3868 IH
taken simultaneously with manufacturing and dis-
1
tribution planning. As part of these actions, the 
2
Federal Government made investments in critical 
3
manufacturing capacity, giving pharmaceutical com-
4
panies confidence that if they invested in developing 
5
a vaccine, once the vaccine received authorization 
6
from the Food and Drug Administration, these com-
7
panies would be able to immediately begin distrib-
8
uting the vaccine. 
9
(23) Despite efforts to speed vaccine develop-
10
ment to address the COVID–19 pandemic, the emer-
11
gency use authorization (EUA) process utilized by 
12
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) appears 
13
to have met rigorous safety and efficacy standards. 
14
(24) On July 14, 2020, United States CDC 
15
issued stronger recommendations to wear masks as 
16
a strategy for preventing the spread of COVID–19. 
17
United States CDC Director Robert Redfield, in a 
18
news release from the agency, identified masks as 
19
‘‘one of the most powerful weapons we have to slow 
20
and stop the spread of the virus’’. 
21
(25) On December 11, 2020, the FDA issued 
22
the first EUA for a vaccine for the prevention of 
23
COVID–19 in individuals 16 years of age and older. 
24
04:29 Jul 14, 2021
H3868
11 
•HR 3868 IH
The EUA allowed the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID–19 
1
Vaccine to be distributed in the United States. 
2
(26) On December 18, 2020, the FDA issued 
3
an EUA for the second vaccine for the prevention of 
4
COVID–19 in individuals 16 years of age and older. 
5
The EUA allowed the Moderna COVID–19 Vaccine 
6
to be distributed in the United States for use in in-
7
dividuals 18 years of age and older. 
8
(27) On February 27, 2021, the FDA issued an 
9
EUA for the third vaccine for the prevention of 
10
COVID–19. The EUA allowed the Janssen COVID– 
11
19 Vaccine to be distributed in the United States for 
12
use in individuals 18 years of age and older. 
13
(28) Because of the hard work of countless 
14
Americans, this public-private partnership, and the 
15
funding and support from Congress, multiple safe 
16
and effective COVID–19 vaccines have been, and are 
17
still being, developed and manufactured, and, as of 
18
May 16, 2021, about 273,000,000 vaccine doses had 
19
been administered in the United States. 
20
(29) Despite the successful development and 
21
rollout of the current COVID–19 vaccines, it is not 
22
fully known whether these vaccines will protect peo-
23
ple from the emergence and potential future emer-
24
04:29 Jul 14, 2021
H3868
12 
•HR 3868 IH
gence of variants of SARS–CoV–2, the virus that 
1
causes COVID–19. 
2
(30) The emergence of future variants of 
3
SARS–CoV–2 could require that the United States 
4
continue to develop new COVID–19 vaccines and 
5
that people receive a COVID–19 booster shot on a 
6
regular, potentially annual, basis to maintain immu-
7
nity. 
8
(31) According to the FDA fact sheets on 
9
COVID–19 vaccines, there are certain populations 
10
for whom existing COVID–19 vaccines are not indi-
11
cated or authorized or for whom there is insufficient 
12
data to inform vaccine-related risks including— 
13
(A) people with severe allergies to vaccine 
14
components or who are immunocompromised; 
15
(B) people with certain pre-existing condi-
16
tions such as bleeding disorders and women 
17
who are pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or 
18
breastfeeding; and 
19
(C) children under the age of 18. 
20
(32) Because of potential risks that the vaccine 
21
poses to certain people, it is important that every 
22
patient is able to consult his or her doctor to deter-
23
mine whether one of the COVID–19 vaccines is ap-
24
propriate for that patient. 
25

•HR 3868 IH
(33) Consistent with fundamental human 
1
rights, and medical and legal ethics and proper 
2
standards of medical care, every American has the 
3
right to ‘‘informed consent’’ with respect to medical 
4
treatment, meaning that he or she has a right to be 
5
fully informed about the nature of his or her health 
6
care and to participate in and voluntarily make deci-
7
sions related to his or her care. In addition, every 
8
patient has a right to medical privacy to expect that 
9
the decisions and nature of care will be kept con-
10
fidential by his or her health care provider and any-
11
one who has access to the individual’s medical 
12
records, including vaccination records. 
13
(34) At various times in history, governments 
14
and medical professionals have violated these and 
15
other inherent rights including by coercing patients, 
16
failing to properly inform patients of, or even inten-
17
tionally begin deceptive with patients about, their 
18
rights and the risks inherent with various medical 
19
procedures, experiments, and studies—including the 
20
Tuskegee syphilis experiments, forced sterilization, 
21
lobotomy procedures, electro-shock therapy, certain 
22
psychological studies, collection and utilization of in-
23
dividuals’ cells and parts of their body, or from fetal

tissue of a patient’s offspring, without knowledge or 
1
consent, and eugenics laws. 
2
(35) The absence of informed consent not only 
3
constitutes a violation of medical ethics and stand-
4
ards of care, in some cases, treatment may also con-
5
stitute a crime, such as battery. 
6
(36) Criminal battery stemming from violations 
7
of medical ethics and informed consent standards 
8
have led to a significant degree of distrust of the 
9
government, public health officials, and medical pro-
10
fessionals by certain groups and communities includ-
11
ing among the most vulnerable populations such as 
12
ethnic minorities, immigrants, economically dis-
13
advantaged, unmarried mothers, those with disabil-
14
ities, and those with mental illnesses. 
15
(37) On January 12, 2021, United States CDC 
16
issued an order requiring proof of a negative 
17
COVID–19 test for all air passengers arriving from 
18
a foreign country to the United States, and on Feb-
19
ruary 14, 2021, the United States CDC announced 
20
it would not recommend required testing for domes-
21
tic air travel. 
22
(38) On March 19, 2021, the WHO released 
23
draft recommendations for a Smart Vaccine Certifi-
24
cate—what amounts to a form of a ‘‘vaccine pass-

1
Certificate Working Group’’, ‘‘support COVID–19 
2
vaccine delivery and monitoring’’ and to serve ‘‘cur-
3
rent and future requirements, toward the dual pur-
4
poses of (1) supporting continuity of care; and (2) 
5
cross-border uses’’. 
6
(39) The International Air Transport Associa-
7
tion has developed the Travel Pass Initiative to 
8
gather information on entry and exit testing require-
9
ments, allow passengers to create a digital passport 
10
that verifies testing and vaccination status, and es-
11
tablish the capability of sharing health data with 
12
government authorities. 
13
(40) The European Commission has proposed a 
14
Digital Green Certificate on March 17, 2021, to 
15
prove a passenger’s vaccination status, test results, 
16
and COVID–19 antibodies that may be adopted by 
17
a country for public health restrictions. 
18
(41) The State of New York is testing a vaccine 
19
certification to be used for admission into public 
20
events. 
21
(42) More than 225 companies and organiza-
22
tions are involved in what is known as the Vaccina-
23
tion Credential Initiative, a program intended to es-
24

•HR 3868 IH
tablish standards for developers to build digital vac-
1
cine passports. 
2
(43) On April 2, 2021, the United States CDC 
3
announced vaccinated people could travel safely. On 
4
April 5, 2021, the United States CDC rec-
5
ommended, but did not require, passengers to be 
6
vaccinated, though cruise ships are still not per-
7
mitted to resume normal operations. 
8
(44) The White House, while saying the 
9
COVID–19 Task Force will not create a vaccine 
10
passport, has engaged in a multi-agency coordina-
11
tion effort led by the Office of the National Coordi-
12
nator for Health Information Technology to develop 
13
criteria and principles for a vaccine passport created 
14
by the private sector. 
15
(45) The private sector, which includes many 
16
large technology companies that previously have 
17
shown disregard for privacy and a willingness to en-
18
gage in censorship of Americans while bowing to the 
19
will of the Chinese Communist party, are pursuing 
20
digital vaccine passports that can be adopted by gov-
21
ernments and other public establishments to authen-
22
ticate personal health information. 
23
(46) During a March 2, 2021, virtual meeting 
24
lead by the Federal Health IT Coordinating Council 
25
04:29 Jul 14, 2021
H3868
17 
•HR 3868 IH
on behalf of the Biden Administration, a slide pres-
1
entation included the following: ‘‘Proof of individual 
2
COVID-related health status is likely to be an im-
3
portant component of pandemic response, proof of 
4
immunization will likely become a major, if not the 
5
primary, form of health status validation,’’ and a 
6
‘‘unified Federal approach [is] required to ensure 
7
Federal activities are working toward the same com-
8
mon goals for vaccine [passports].’’ Additionally, the 
9
presentation suggested the Biden Administration ex-
10
pects that ‘‘Federal entities’’ would ‘‘likely require 
11
vaccine verification for a variety of purposes’’ and 
12
that the ‘‘Federal government will inevitably by in-
13
volved with vaccine credential solutions . . . .’’. 
14
(47) The Federal Health IT Coordinating 
15
Council also listed a number of international organi-
16
zations and private companies that are working on 
17
the development of vaccine passports. 
18
(48) The development, implementation, and uti-
19
lization of vaccine passports, whether by Federal or 
20
State government, or the private sector, has the po-
21
tential for significant misuse and abuse, leading to 
22
the denial of constitutionally protected freedoms 
23
such as freedom of association and freedom of move-
24
ment, and could allow the government or corporate

interests to begin to track people’s health status on 
1
a large-scale basis. 
2
(49) There currently exists no clear regulatory 
3
framework to fully protect the privacy of United 
4
States citizens and United States nationals with re-
5
spect to their vaccination records and negative 
6
COVID–19 test results. 
7
(50) The widespread utilization of vaccine pass-
8
ports will certainly lead to discrimination by busi-
9
nesses that provide public accommodations as they 
10
could begin to require a customer to demonstrate his 
11
or her health status, through the presentment of a 
12
vaccine passport or other ‘‘papers’’ or by requiring 
13
that the customer disclose his or her protected

health information, before the business agrees to 
15
serve or otherwise do business with such individual, 
16
meaning the denial of service in such cases could be 
17
based on an individual’s disability, health status, or 
18
familial status, such as a restaurant denying service 
19
to a man who has not been vaccinated based on the 
20
advice of his doctor due to a previous anaphylaxis 
21
(allergic) reaction to an ingredient found in the 
22
COVID–19 vaccines. 
23
(51) The widespread acceptance of vaccine 
24
passports could also lead to employment discrimina-

tion, where employers take adverse employment ac-
1
tions against employees who are not vaccinated be-
2
cause of an underlying health condition and without 
3
regard to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 
4
1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.) (ADA), which re-
5
quires an interactive process whereby the employer 
6
follows the law to assess if the employee can and 
7
should be reasonably accommodated under the ADA. 
8
For example, without proper disability protections, 
9
an employer could terminate a female employee who 
10
has not been vaccinated based on the advice of her 
11
doctor simply because she is pregnant. 
12
(52) In February 2021, a business in New York 
13
told its employees that the business was instituting 
14
a vaccine mandate and, when a woman who worked 
15
there decided against getting a COVID–19 vaccine 
16
because she was trying to get pregnant, she was told 
17
her employment was being terminated. 
18
(53) In March 2021, a woman in Cumberland 
19
County, Pennsylvania was suspended from her job 
20
after her employer issued a vaccine mandate for its 
21
employees. The woman, who said she is not anti-vac-
22
cination, wanted sufficient time to consult with her 
23
doctor to see if the vaccine was appropriate for her.

(54) 
For 
women 
who 
are 
pregnant 
or 
1
breastfeeding, the CDC has indicated that ‘‘the po-
2
tential risks of COVID–19 vaccines to the pregnant 
3
person and the fetus are unknown because these 
4
vaccines have not been studied in pregnant people’’. 
5
Accordingly, it is highly likely that the implementa-
6
tion and use of vaccine passports, refusal to provide 
7
services to unvaccinated persons, and decision by 
8
employers to impose a vaccine mandate and to take 
9
adverse employment actions against unvaccinated 
10
employees, are likely to be unfair and discrimina-
11
tory, disparately impacting women because of their 
12
sex. 
13
(55) Given that several COVID–19 vaccines are 
14
not recommended for children under the age of 12, 
15
the implementation and widespread utilization of 
16
vaccine passports could lead to the refusal to provide 
17
services to unvaccinated persons, such as the denial 
18
of services to families with small children, meaning 
19
certain vaccine-related policies could lead to age or 
20
familial-status-related discrimination. 
21
(56) The denial of public services and public ac-
22
commodations, as well as adverse employment ac-
23
tions, based on COVID–19 vaccination status, lack 
24
of or refusal to present a vaccine passport, refusal

to get vaccinated, or requiring an individual to ex-

plain the underlying reason why they are not vac-
2
cinated, could constitute unlawful discrimination, in-
3
cluding as to sex, age, familial status, disability, or 
4
based on genetic or other health condition. 
5
(57) Any United States person that requests 
6
the vaccine records of a United States individual, in-
7
cluding data such as a copy or other digital record 
8
of a vaccine passport or similar proof of vaccination, 
9
should be regarded as having collected ‘‘protected 
10
health information’’ and should be regarded as a 
11
‘‘covered entity’’ as defined under the Health Insur-
12
ance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 
13
(Public Law 104–191). 
14
(58) The policy of the United States is to rec-
15
ognize, defend, and protect the inherent rights of the 
16
individual, including the right to privacy, the right 
17
of liberty, the right to be secure in one’s person, the

right of the individual to be informed about any 
19
medical procedures, treatment, or vaccination, and 
20
the right of the individual to provide or withhold

take advantage of, manipulate, or enflame public 
2
fear, stoke hatred of minority groups, or increase in-
3
tolerance toward the diversity that builds our Na-

5
(60) Congress finds that there is a clear need

for the Federal Government to take specific action

without fear of coercion, forced vaccination, loss of
