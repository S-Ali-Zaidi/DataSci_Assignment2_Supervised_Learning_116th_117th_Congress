SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Cameroon TPS Act 
2
of 2021’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) Cameroon is in the midst of four ongoing 
6
armed conflicts generally characterized by state- 
7
sponsored violence, nonstate transnational terrorism, 
8
and widespread human rights violations, making 
9
safe return to Cameroon impossible. 
10
(2) Since late 2016, the conflict between the 
11
government and armed separatists has displaced 
12
over 700,000 people in the Anglophone regions of 
13
Cameroon and resulted in thousands of civilian cas-
14
ualties. 
15
(3) This conflict has also exacerbated long-
16
standing tensions between farmers and nomadic 
17
herders over natural resources, resulting in violence 
18
and increased civilian casualties in the Northwest re-
19
gion of Cameroon. 
20
(4) Cameroon’s presidential election in 2018 
21
and local elections in 2020 exacerbated long-sim-
22
mering political and ethnic tensions, and each re-
23
sulted in uprisings and violence. 
24
(5) In the Far North region, Boko Haram and 
25
the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) continue 
26

to terrorize communities, including by using kidnap-
1
ping and child soldiers in suicide bombings of 
2
schools, mosques, and refugee camps. 
3
(6) The civil war in the Central African Repub-
4
lic has also spilled over to Cameroon, with cross-bor-
5
der militias initiating conflicts in the East region. 
6
(7) These conflicts have led to critical shortages 
7
of essentials such as water, food, housing, and 
8
health care, leaving an estimated 4.4 million people 
9
in need of urgent humanitarian assistance and 
10
roughly 1 million people displaced internally. 
11
(8) In 2020, the Department of State reported 
12
that Cameroonian authorities used these conflicts as 
13
a pretext to engage in extrajudicial killings, arbi-
14
trary detentions, torture, and targeted violence 
15
against marginalized populations. 
16
(9) Cameroonian authorities have also targeted 
17
Cameroonians who have fled to the United States. 
18
Prior to scheduled removal flights leaving the United 
19
States, government-led protests in front of the 
20
United States Embassy in Yaounde´ called on the 
21
United States Government to either criminally 
22
charge or deport asylum seekers who they alleged 
23
were backers of Anglophone separatists. 
24

(10) The United States nevertheless deported a 
1
significant number of Cameroonians, reportedly 
2
under duress, to face politically motivated detention 
3
and torture at the hands of their government. 
4
(11) Reports also indicate that upon arrival, 
5
Cameroonian authorities confiscated identity docu-
6
ments and monitored activities of all deported indi-
7
viduals. Family members of such individuals report 
8
that their loved ones are unaccounted for and fear 
9
that they may have been redetained by security 
10
forces. 
11
(12) Cameroonians in the United States cannot 
12
return safely to Cameroon without risking detention, 
13
torture, or displacement. After years of uncertainty, 
14
these individuals deserve stability and temporary re-
15
lief in the United States.
