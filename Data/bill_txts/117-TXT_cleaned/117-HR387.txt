RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the Nation’s law enforcement 
agencies. 
Whereas law enforcement officers protect the American peo-
ple from criminals who seek to perpetrate violence and 
harm innocent lives regardless of the political cir-
cumstances of the day; 
Whereas the brave men and women of the law enforcement 
community continually summon the courage to fulfill 
their solemn oath to ensure the safety of our commu-
nities and provide peace of mind for our Nation’s citi-
zens; 
Whereas America’s law enforcement community also seeks to 
assist the communities they serve through a variety of 
nontraditional means, including nonarrest pathways that 
connect individuals with treatment and recovery pro-

grams to overcome addiction, and juvenile diversion pro-
grams to prevent minors from entering the criminal jus-
tice system; 
Whereas supporting law enforcement officers with the equip-
ment, training, and funding necessary to serve our com-
munities and keep our streets safe has long been a bipar-
tisan issue, dating back to President Clinton and then- 
Senator Biden joining their Republican colleagues to pass 
the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 
1994; 
Whereas law enforcement officers willingly face dangerous 
circumstances and the threat of serious bodily injury or 
death on a daily basis to ensure the safety of all Ameri-
cans; 
Whereas the National Law Enforcement Memorial and Mu-
seum reports that as of December 31, 2020, 1,763 law 
enforcement officers had died in the line of duty during 
the past decade; 
Whereas the National Law Enforcement Memorial and Muse-
um’s 2020 Law Enforcement Officers Fatalities Report 
detailed that 264 law enforcement officers were killed in 
the line of duty in 2020, an increase of 96 percent from 
the previous year, including 48 officers who were killed 
in firearms-related incidents in 2020; 
Whereas peaceful protests have been hijacked by violent ex-
tremists seeking to sow discord, damage property, loot 
businesses, and inflict harm against civilians and law en-
forcement officers; 
Whereas law enforcement officers have been run over, shot, 
hit with objects, and stabbed attempting to maintain 
peace and the rule of law;

Whereas progressive politicians and interest groups have re-
sponded to this violence with calls to defund law enforce-
ment agencies across the Nation; 
Whereas defunding or otherwise handcuffing law enforcement 
officers will make officers less likely to intervene in dan-
gerous situations and will result in law enforcement pull-
ing back from the neighborhoods they are entrusted to 
protect; 
Whereas violent crime increases when law enforcement is 
forced to withdraw from neighborhoods; 
Whereas the New York Police Department reported that the 
number of shootings soared 97 percent from 777 in 2019 
to 1,531 in 2020 and the number of murders jumped by 
44 percent as police faced a stiff round of budget cuts 
and reduced support from local officials; 
Whereas the Los Angeles Police Department reported 322 
homicides as of December 12, 2020, up 30.4 percent 
from 247 at the same point last year, after the depart-
ment’s budget was cut by $150,000,000; 
Whereas violent crimes soared by 21 percent in Minneapolis 
last year as Minneapolis City Council officials continue 
pushing to dismantle the city’s police department while 
hiring private security details for their own personal pro-
tection; 
Whereas the vilification of the Nation’s law enforcement offi-
cers and the embracing of hateful rhetoric against these 
brave men and women only places them further in harm’s 
way; 
Whereas these brave men and women must operate in an en-
vironment where their moral and legal authority is con-
stantly being scrutinized, and they undertake the critical

yet difficult task of addressing the actions of those af-
fected by addiction, homelessness, and mental illness; and 
Whereas efforts to defund police departments will cause ir-
reparable and lasting damage to the Nation: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
