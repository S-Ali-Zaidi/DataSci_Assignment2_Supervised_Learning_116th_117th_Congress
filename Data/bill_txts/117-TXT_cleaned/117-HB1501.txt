A BILL 
To reauthorize the Neighborhood Stabilization Program, and 
for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Affordable Housing

Redevelopment Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds that— 
7
(1) even before the economic hardship caused 
8
by the COVID–19 pandemic, the United States 
9
faced a shortage of more than 7,000,000 affordable

•HR 1501 IH
rental homes to meet the needs of extremely low-in-
1
come renters; 
2
(2) due to financial burdens and loss of income 
3
resulting from the pandemic, millions of people in 
4
the United States are at risk of eviction or fore-
5
closure, and the need for affordable housing is ex-
6
pected to increase dramatically; 
7
(3) homelessness is projected to rise by as much 
8
as 45 percent across the United States as a result 
9
of the pandemic and economic crisis, meaning nearly 
10
1,000,000 people in the United States could be expe-
11
riencing homelessness in the very near future; 
12
(4) in addition to making long-term investments 
13
in the affordable housing stock in the United States, 
14
it is also critically important to focus resources on 
15
more immediate solutions, such as acquiring and re-
16
habilitating existing buildings and placing afford-
17
ability requirements on the housing that is produced; 
18
(5) acquisition and rehabilitation provides two 
19
distinct advantages by lowering per-unit construction 
20
costs and making affordable housing units available 
21
to low-income households much faster; 
22
(6) in addition to rehabilitation of residential 
23
properties, there are opportunities for adaptive reuse 
24
and the conversion of non-residential office and re-

tail properties to create new affordable housing in 
1
communities across the United States; and 
2
(7) helping States, local governments, and non-
3
profit organizations acquire blighted, abandoned, va-
4
cant, foreclosed, or surplus properties and convert 
5
them into affordable housing will allow for the rapid 
6
development of new affordable units, while stimu-
7
lating local economies and creating jobs.
