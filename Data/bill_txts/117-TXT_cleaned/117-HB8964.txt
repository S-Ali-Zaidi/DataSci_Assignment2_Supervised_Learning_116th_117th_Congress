SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Education And Train-
2
ing for Health Act of 2022’’ or the ‘‘EAT for Health Act 
3
of 2022’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
5
Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) According to 2019 National Health Expend-
7
iture Account data, the growth in total national 
8
healthcare expenditures in 2019 reached $3.8 tril-
9
lion, or $11,582 per person. 
10
(2) According to the Center for Disease Control 
11
and Prevention (CDC) around 90 percent of annual 
12
health expenditures are for people with chronic and 
13
mental health conditions. 
14
(3) According to the CDC most people in the 
15
United States don’t eat a healthy diet and consume 
16
too much sodium, saturated fat, and sugar, increas-
17
ing their risk of chronic diseases. Fewer than 1 in 
18
10 adolescents and adults eat enough fruits or vege-
19
tables. 
20
(4) According to National Center for Chronic 
21
Disease 
Prevention 
and 
Health 
Promotion 
22
(NCCDPHP) six in ten Americans live with at least 
23
one chronic disease, like heart disease and stroke, 
24
cancer, or diabetes. 
25

•HR 8964 IH
(5) Seven out of 10 deaths among people in the 
1
United States each year are from chronic diseases 
2
such as cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, and 
3
cancer. 
4
(6) According to NCCDPHP eating healthy 
5
helps prevent, delay, and manage heart disease, type 
6
2 diabetes, and other chronic diseases. (5) According 
7
to the CDC, heart disease is the leading cause of 
8
death for American adults. Approximately 659,000 
9
American adults die each year from cardiovascular 
10
disease. Coronary heart disease alone costs Amer-
11
ican taxpayers $363 billion each year. 
12
(7) Research has shown that following a health-
13
ful diet, including a plant-based diet, can not only 
14
reduce symptoms related to cardiovascular disease 
15
but can also actually reverse damage done to the ar-
16
teries. 
17
(8) According to the Journal of the American 
18
Medical Association, two-thirds of adults in the 
19
United States are currently overweight, and half of 
20
those overweight individuals are obese. One in three 
21
children are overweight, and one-fifth of children are 
22
obese. The United States spends about $147 to 
23
$210 billion a year on obesity related diseases, in-
24

cluding type 2 diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, 
1
and arthritis. 
2
(9) An estimated 34.2 million people in the 
3
United States have diabetes. Another 88 million 
4
American adults have prediabetes. The Centers for 
5
Disease Control and Prevention predicts that one in 
6
three children born in 2000 will develop diabetes at 
7
some point in their lives. Total direct estimated 
8
costs of diagnosed diabetes increased from $188 bil-
9
lion in 2012 to $237 billion in 2017. 
10
(10) A consensus statement endorsed by Amer-
11
ican Association of Clinical Endocrinology, sup-
12
ported by the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, 
13
and co-sponsored by the Endocrine Society reports 
14
that plant-based diets and other nutrition interven-
15
tions aid type 2 diabetes remission. 
16
(11) According to the American Cancer Society, 
17
there will be an estimated 1,918,030 new cancer 
18
cases diagnosed and 609,360 cancer deaths in the 
19
United States in 2022. That is equivalent to about 
20
1,670 deaths per day and accounts for nearly 1 of 
21
every 4 deaths. The National Cancer Institute esti-
22
mates that cancer-related direct medical costs in the 
23
U.S. were $183 billion in 2015 and are projected to 
24

increase to $246 billion by 2030, a 34% increase 
1
based only on population growth and aging. 
2
(12) According to a 2008 survey published in 
3
Journal of the American College of Nutrition, physi-
4
cians felt inadequately trained to provide proper nu-
5
trition advice. Ninety-four percent felt nutrition 
6
counseling should be included during primary care 
7
visits, but only 14 percent felt adequately trained to 
8
provide such counseling. 
9
(13) A 1985 National Academy of Sciences re-
10
port recommended that all medical schools require at 
11
least 25 contact hours of nutrition education. Ac-
12
cording to a 2009 national survey of medical colleges 
13
published in Academic Medicine, only 38 percent of 
14
medical schools met these minimum standards by re-
15
quiring 25 hours of nutrition education as part of 
16
their general curricula in 2004. By 2010, that num-
17
ber had shrunk to 27 percent. 
18
(14) According to the Journal of Nutrition in 
19
Clinical Practice in 2010, more than half of grad-
20
uating medical students felt their nutrition edu-
21
cation was insufficient. 
22
(15) Recognizing the importance of nutrition, 
23
Healthy People 2030—the Federal Government’s 
24
framework for a healthier Nation—includes a goal 
25
16:54 Oct 07, 2022
H8964

•HR 8964 IH
(NWS–05) to increase the proportion of health care 
1
visits by adults with obesity that include counseling 
2
or education related to nutrition, weight loss, or 
3
physical activity. According to Healthy People 2030, 
4
only 24.8 percent of physician office visits included 
5
counseling about nutrition or diet in 2016. 
6
(16) According to Mission: Readiness, obesity 
7
disqualifies 31 percent of youth from serving if they 
8
so choose. 
9
(17) According to the Journal of American 
10
Health Promotion, the military spends well over $1 
11
billion a year to treat weight-related health problems 
12
such as heart disease and diabetes through its 
13
TRICARE health insurance for active duty per-
14
sonnel, reservists, retirees and their families. 
15
(18) According to the Department of Health 
16
and Human Services, racial and ethnic minority 
17
groups experience higher rates of chronic health con-
18
ditions, including diabetes, hypertension, obesity, 
19
heart disease, and cancer when compared to their 
20
White counterparts due to Social Determinants of 
21
Health, including lack of access to nutritious food.
