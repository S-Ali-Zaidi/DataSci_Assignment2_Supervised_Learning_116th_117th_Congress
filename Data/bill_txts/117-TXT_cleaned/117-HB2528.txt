•HR 2528 IH
(1) the African Burial Ground National His-
1
toric Landmark in New York, New York, holds the 
2
remains of up to 20,000 enslaved Africans and 
3
early-generation African Americans from the colonial 
4
era; 
5
(2) the Africans and African Americans that 
6
suffered under slavery show us the strength of the 
7
human character and provide us with a model of 
8
courage, commitment, and perseverance; 
9
(3) as President George W. Bush stated on 
10
July 8, 2003, during his remarks at Goree Island, 
11
Senegal: ‘‘For 250 years the captives endured an as-
12
sault on their culture and their dignity. The spirit 
13
of Africans in America did not break. . . . All the 
14
generations of oppression under the laws of man 
15
could not crush the hope of freedom and defeat the 
16
purposes of God.’’; 
17
(4) on February 27, 2006, President George W. 
18
Bush established the National Monument, which was 
19
comprised of the approximately 15,000-square-foot 
20
parcel of the National Historic Landmark that was 
21
bounded by Duane and Elk Streets in Lower Man-
22
hattan; 
23
(5) an international memorial museum facility

dedicated to those individuals who suffered the grave

injustice of slavery in the United States, while at the 
1
same time helping to build the country, would— 
2
(A) reflect the significance of the African 
3
Burial Ground; and 
4
(B) help the people of the United States 
5
understand the past and honor the history of all 
6
people in the United States; 
7
(6) in 1998, the Secretary of the Smithsonian 
8
Institution— 
9
(A) stated that the African Burial Ground 
10
affords the perfect opportunity to gain insight 
11
into— 
12
(i) the institution of slavery, as prac-
13
ticed in urban, rural, northern, and south-
14
ern parts of the United States; and 
15
(ii) the international slave trade; and 
16
(B) proposed that a partnership be formed 
17
among the Smithsonian, the National Park 
18
Service, and the General Services Administra-
19
tion to further develop the African Burial 
20
Ground; 
21
(7) the National Museum of African American 
22
History and Culture Act (20 U.S.C. 80r et seq.), 
23
which authorized construction of a museum in 
24
Washington, DC, identified the period of slavery as

•HR 2528 IH
one of the periods of the African-American diaspora 
1
that would be encompassed by the museum; 
2
(8) the African Burial Ground— 
3
(A) is unlike any other anthropological and 
4
symbolic site in the United States or the world; 
5
(B) includes DNA samples from the re-
6
markably well-preserved human remains that 
7
will enable researchers to trace the home 
8
‘‘roots’’ in Africa of those individuals buried at 
9
the African Burial Ground; and 
10
(C) provides a fitting location for a na-
11
tional memorial facility, relating to the National 
12
Museum of African American History and Cul-
13
ture that would— 
14
(i) pay special tribute to— 
15
(I) the thousands of enslaved in-
16
dividuals who are buried at the Afri-
17
can Burial Ground; and 
18
(II) all of the individuals who 
19
were enslaved during the history of 
20
the United States; 
21
(ii) examine the African cultural tra-
22
ditions brought to the United States by the 
23
enslaved; and

(A) was first recommended by a Federal 
5
steering committee in 1992; and 
6
(B) in conjunction with the World Trade 
7
Center memorial and other nearby sites, would

attract millions of visitors from the United

10
tribution to the development and revitalization 
11
of Lower Manhattan in response to the attacks 
12
on the World Trade Center of September 11, 
13
2001; 
14
(10) Public Law 99–511 (100 Stat. 2080) en-
15
couraged support for the establishment of a com-
16
memorative structure within the National Park Sys-
17
tem or on other Federal land that is dedicated to the 
18
promotion of understanding, knowledge, opportunity, 
19
and equality for all people; 
20
(11) similar to the National Museum of the Na-
21
