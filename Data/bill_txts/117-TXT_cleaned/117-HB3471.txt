A BILL 
To amend the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to require 
issuers to disclose to the Securities and Exchange Com-
mission information regarding workforce management 
policies, practices, and performance, and for other pur-
poses. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Workforce Investment

Disclosure Act of 2021’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 3471 IH
(1) One of the keys to the 20th century post- 
1
war economic success of the United States was the 
2
ability to prepare workers over the course of their 
3
lives for success through multiple sectors across soci-
4
ety. Unfortunately, during the several decades pre-
5
ceding the date of enactment of this Act, there has 
6
been a shift in business norms and in society. While 
7
Congress recognizes that the technology and job 
8
skills required for some jobs has changed dramati-
9
cally, the private and public partnership to hire 
10
workers at different education levels and invest in 
11
them for the long-term is broken. 
12
(2) Available data from the 10-year period pre-
13
ceding the date of enactment of this Act suggests 
14
that businesses are investing less in worker training 
15
during that time period, not more. 
16
(3) In the wake of the 2008 global financial cri-
17
sis, there was a well-documented decline in overall 
18
business investment. That decline coincides with the 
19
wage polarization of workers and an increase in 
20
spending on share buybacks and dividends, leading 
21
several researchers to conclude that companies are 
22
de-emphasizing investment at the expense of increas-
23
ing returns for shareholders. The onset of a global 
24

•HR 3471 IH
pandemic may make that trend worse, especially 
1
with respect to investments in workers. 
2
(4) As part of the overall decline in investment 
3
described in paragraph (3), publicly traded compa-
4
nies are being provided with incentives to prioritize 
5
investments in physical assets over investments in 
6
their workforces, meaning that those companies are 
7
investing in robots instead of individuals. In fact, 
8
there are already signs that automation has in-
9
creased during the COVID–19 pandemic. 
10
(5) More than ever, the Federal Government, 
11
through company disclosure practices, needs to un-
12
derstand exactly how companies are investing in 
13
their workers. Over the several months preceding the 
14
date of enactment of this Act, companies across the 
15
United States have taken extreme actions to adapt 
16
and respond to evolving workforce challenges pre-
17
sented by COVID–19. 
18
(6) JUST Capital has been tracking the re-
19
sponses of the Standard and Poor’s 100 largest pub-
20
lic companies to their workers and has found wide 
21
variation in the policies implemented, as well as with 
22
respect to the disclosure of those policies. Through 
23
different responses to their workforces, from layoffs 
24
to workplace safety to paid leave, the COVID–19 
25

pandemic is exposing the myriad ways that work-
1
force management practices of companies pose oper-
2
ational and reputational risks for short- and long- 
3
term financial performance. 
4
(7) Even before the COVID–19 pandemic, there 
5
was a growing body of research establishing a rela-
6
tionship between measurable workforce management, 
7
which is the way that companies manage their em-
8
ployees, and firm performance. In a study of 2,000 
9
large companies, Harvard Law School’s Labor and 
10
Work Life Program found that forward-thinking 
11
workforce policies that prioritize workers, such as 
12
how companies train, retain, and pay their workers, 
13
are correlated with long-term financial performance. 
14
(8) Disclosure of workforce management poli-
15
cies should be part of a Government-wide economic 
16
recovery strategy. Just as a set of generally accepted 
17
accounting 
principles 
(commonly 
known 
as 
18
‘‘GAAP’’) was urgently adopted after the Great De-
19
pression, standardized, comparable metrics of work-
20
force disclosure requirements in the context of the 
21
COVID–19 pandemic are critical for investors to ac-
22
curately measure and project company performance, 
23
both in the present and in the future. 
24
07:27 Jun 22, 2021
H3471

•HR 3471 IH
(9) Because many companies already track 
1
workforce metrics internally, moving towards a 
2
transparent disclosure regime would allow investors 
3
to better judge whether companies are managing 
4
risks 
and 
making 
the 
investments 
in 
their 
5
workforces that are needed for long-term growth. 
6
(10) Businesses increasingly rely on workforce 
7
innovation and intellectual capital for competitive-
8
ness. Workplace benefits, particularly paid sick 
9
leave, medical leave, and flexible work arrangements, 
10
critically support employee mental and physical well- 
11
being. 
12
(11) Race- and gender-based workplace dis-
13
crimination have been tied to negative health out-
14
comes, as well as lower productivity, trust, morale, 
15
and satisfaction and higher rates of absenteeism and 
16
turnover. Organizational reporting on practices to 
17
reduce discrimination can increase employee job sat-
18
isfaction, performance, and engagement. 
19
(12) According to the Centers for Disease Con-
20
trol and Prevention, work-related stress is the lead-
21
ing occupational health risk and, per the American 
22
Institute of Stress, job stress costs United States in-
23
dustry more than $300,000,000,000 per year in ac-

cidents, absenteeism, employee turnover, diminished 
1
productivity, and medical, legal, and insurance costs. 
2
(13) Employee health and well-being is a key 
3
asset to delivering long-term value, with 80 percent 
4
of public companies that took concrete actions on 
5
health and well-being having seen larger improve-
6
ments in financial performance. 
7
(14) Organizational well-being interventions can 
8
create cost savings of up to 10 dollars for every dol-
9
lar invested. Specifically, for every dollar that em-
10
ployers spend on workplace disease prevention and 
11
well-being programs, there is a $3.27 reduction in 
12
employee medical costs and a $2.73 reduction in ab-
13
senteeism costs. Employers that implement work-
14
place health promotion programs have seen reduc-
15
tions in sick leave, health plan costs, and workers’ 
16
compensation and disability insurance costs of ap-
17
proximately 25 percent. 
18
(15) The Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
19
vention has found that preventable chronic condi-
20
tions are a major contributor to insurance premium 
21
and employee medical claim costs, which are at an 
22
all-time high, and a Milken Institute study shows 
23
that employers paid $2,600,000,000,000 in 2016 for 
24
the indirect costs of employee chronic disease due to 
25
07:27 Jun 22, 2021
H3471
7 
•HR 3471 IH
work absences, lost wages, and reduced economic 
1
productivity. 
2
(16) The COVID–19 pandemic has severely im-
3
pacted employee physical, mental, and emotional 
4
well-being by increasing stress, depression, burnout, 
5
and mortality rates of chronic disease and by reduc-
6
ing work-life balance and financial security, with 
7
these challenges likely to persist due to uncertainty 
8
and instability even as employees return to work. 
9
Before the COVID–19 pandemic, but especially in 
10
the face of that pandemic, employers that advance 
11
policies and practices that support workforce health, 
12
safety, and well-being are likely to outperform com-
13
petitors and benefit from lower costs.
