•HR 7265 IH
(1) Cerebral palsy is the most common motor 
1
disability in children, affecting more than 1,000,000 
2
Americans, 1 in 345 children, and over 17,000,000 
3
people worldwide. 
4
(2) In the United States, more than 10,000 ba-
5
bies are diagnosed with cerebral palsy each year. 
6
(3) Cerebral palsy is a broad group of disorders 
7
disrupting a person’s ability to move, sit, stand, 
8
walk, talk, and use their hands. 
9
(4) In more than 80 percent of cases, the cause 
10
of cerebral palsy is unknown. 
11
(5) Seventy-five percent of individuals with cer-
12
ebral palsy also have 1 or more additional develop-
13
mental disabilities including epilepsy, intellectual dis-
14
abilities, communication problems, learning and at-
15
tention disorders, chronic pain, autism, hearing dis-
16
orders, and visual impairments or blindness. 
17
(6) Children with cerebral palsy are more likely 
18
to die from the flu and related viruses, including 
19
COVID–19, than children without neurologic dis-
20
orders. 
21
(7) There is no consensus of best practices for 
22
a person with cerebral palsy at the time of diagnosis 
23
or through the lifespan.

•HR 7265 IH
(8) It is estimated that the lifetime care and 
1
medical costs for all people with cerebral palsy who 
2
were born in 2000 alone will total more than 
3
$13,500,000,000. The loss of productivity and lost 
4
wages of the individual with cerebral palsy and their 
5
family members is more than $35,000,000,000. 
6
(9) There is no known cure for cerebral palsy, 
7
and in most cases, it is not preventable.
