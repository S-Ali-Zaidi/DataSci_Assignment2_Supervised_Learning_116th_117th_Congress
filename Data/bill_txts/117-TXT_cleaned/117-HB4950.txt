ommendations for institutions of higher education on

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Beyond the Box for

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 4950 IH
(1) An estimated 70,000,000 Americans have 
1
some type of arrest or conviction record that would 
2
appear in a criminal background check. 
3
(2) Each year, more than 600,000 people re-
4
turn to society from State or Federal prison. 
5
(3) Nearly 11,000,000 Americans are admitted 
6
to city and county jails each year, with an average 
7
daily population of more than 700,000 people. 
8
(4) An estimated 2,100,000 youth under the 
9
age of 18 are arrested every year in the United 
10
States. 
11
(5) 1,700,000 juvenile delinquency cases are 
12
disposed of in juvenile courts annually. 
13
(6) Juvenile records are not always confidential; 
14
many States disclose information about youth in-
15
volvement with the juvenile justice system or do not 
16
have procedures to seal or expunge juvenile records. 
17
(7) The compounding effects of collateral con-
18
sequences due to criminal justice involvement hinder 
19
the ability of individuals to reenter society success-
20
fully. 
21
(8) People of color and low-income people are 
22
disproportionately impacted by the collateral con-
23
sequences of criminal justice involvement.

(9) Incarceration leads to decreased earnings, 
1
unemployment, and poverty. 
2
(10) Upon reentry, lower educational attain-
3
ment, a lack of work skills or history, and the stig-
4
ma of a criminal record can hinder a formerly incar-
5
cerated person’s ability to return to their commu-
6
nities successfully. 
7
(11) One way to improve reentry outcomes is to 
8
increase educational opportunities for people with a 
9
criminal or juvenile justice history. 
10
(12) By reducing rearrests and reconvictions, 
11
and by increasing educational attainment, formerly 
12
incarcerated individuals are better situated to find 
13
stable employment, contributing to their commu-
14
nities.
