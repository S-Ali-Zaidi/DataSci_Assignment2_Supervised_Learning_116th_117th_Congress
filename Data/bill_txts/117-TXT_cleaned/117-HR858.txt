RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the week of December 26, 2021, as the ‘‘Week 
of the Quincentennial of the Fight Against Black Slavery 
in the Americas’’. 
Whereas, on the 26th day of December 1521, the first his-
torically recorded rebellion of enslaved African people 
took place in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic; 
Whereas tragically there is no perspective of the rebellion 
from the slaves, however, it was described in detail in the 
Historia General y Natural de las Indias, by Gonzalo 
Ferna´ndez de Oviedo; 
Whereas on the sugar plantation of Diego Colon, eldest son 
of Christopher Columbus and Viceroy of the Indies, ap-
proximately 20 African people who had been forcibly kid-
napped and enslaved rebelled;

Whereas those individuals, taking notice of the lowered guard 
of their kidnappers, conspired to free themselves on the 
second day of Christmas of the year 1521; 
Whereas after rising up and escaping their confinement, 
these 20 individuals were joined by many others, both Af-
rican and Taino, in order to maintain their freedom; 
Whereas these individuals moved toward the mountains in the 
middle of the island, during which time they saw combat 
with the White kidnappers and farmers who tried to con-
fine them again; 
Whereas after some time, the Spanish colonist killed or cap-
tured all those who had escaped, and thereafter created 
a series of ordinances that severely limited movement of 
freedom of the already enslaved peoples, and provided 
new mechanisms for keeping them from ever rebelling 
again; 
Whereas this set of ordinances, being one of the first of its 
kind, enforcing the economy of mass enslavement in the 
New World, has left an indelible and infamous mark on 
the history of the laws, not just of the Dominican Repub-
lic, but of this Nation as well; 
Whereas this early revolt of human beings against those who 
believed them to be property, was perhaps the first time 
in this hemisphere, after the first contact of Christopher 
Columbus, that the values that we extol in these United 
States, liberty and freedom, were manifested; and 
Whereas on the quincentennial anniversary of such an 
impactful event, the fight for those values Africans and 
Taino rebels adamantly defended is ongoing, continued 
by their descendants and all freedom-loving people in 
these United States: Now, therefore, be it
