SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress the finds the following: 
2
(1) The use of animals in research has been an 
3
issue of public concern since the mid-20th century, 
4
because animals used in research will, in most cases, 
5
experience fear, pain, confinement, and premature 
6
death. 
7
(2) Section 495 of the Health Research Exten-
8
sion Act is the statutory basis for the public health 
9
service policy of the Federal Government with re-
10
spect to humane care and use of laboratory animals. 
11
(3) Currently, the public health service policy of 
12
the Surgeon General does not cover the post re-
13
search treatment of such animals. 
14
(4) Animals used in research include animals 
15
commonly kept as companion animals by the public. 
16
(5) More than 64,000 dogs, 18,000 cats, and 
17
145,000 rabbits are used in experiments in the 
18
United States each year and much of the research 
19
is conducted at facilities that receive public funding 
20
through the National Institutes of Health. 
21
(6) Due to an absence of Federal requirements, 
22
12 States have enacted laws governing the post re-
23
search placement for dogs and cats used in publicly 
24
funded research institutions.

(7) A national requirement is needed to ensure 
1
that research institutions that receive tax payer 
2
funding establish adoption policies for companion 
3
animals that are no longer used for research, includ-
4
ing finding such animals a home and adopting trans-
5
parent policies concerning the success of such re-
6
quirement.
