RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the designation of September 2022 
as ‘‘National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month’’. 
Whereas more than 3,100,000 men in the United States are 
living with prostate cancer; 
Whereas 1 in 8 men in the United States will be diagnosed 
with prostate cancer in their lifetimes and 1 in 41 men 
in the United States will die from prostate cancer; 
Whereas prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed 
nonskin cancer and the second-leading cause of cancer- 
related deaths among men in the United States;

Whereas the American Cancer Society estimates that, in 
2022, 268,490 men will be diagnosed with, and more 
than 34,500 men will die of, prostate cancer; 
Whereas 40 percent of newly diagnosed prostate cancer cases 
occur in men under the age of 65; 
Whereas the odds of developing prostate cancer rise rapidly 
after age 50; 
Whereas African-American men suffer from a prostate cancer 
incidence rate that is significantly higher than that of 
White men and have more than double the prostate can-
cer mortality rate than that of White men; 
Whereas having a father or brother with prostate cancer 
more than doubles the risk of a man developing prostate 
cancer, with a higher risk for men who have a brother 
with the disease and the highest risk for men with several 
affected relatives; 
Whereas screening by a digital rectal examination and a pros-
tate-specific antigen blood test can detect the disease at 
the earlier, more treatable stages, which could increase 
the chances of survival for more than 5 years to nearly 
100 percent; 
Whereas only 30 percent of men survive more than 5 years 
if diagnosed with prostate cancer after the cancer has 
metastasized; 
Whereas there are typically no noticeable symptoms of pros-
tate cancer in the early stages, making appropriate 
screening critical; 
Whereas, in fiscal year 2022, the Director of the National In-
stitutes 
of 
Health 
will 
support 
approximately 
$280,000,000 in research projects focused specifically on 
prostate cancer;

•HRES 1336 IH 
Whereas, in fiscal year 2022, Congress appropriated 
$110,000,000 for the Prostate Cancer Research Program 
of the Department of Defense; 
Whereas the Department of Veterans Affairs has established 
20 Precision Oncology Centers of Excellence in order to 
deliver precision oncology services to veterans suffering 
from prostate cancer; 
Whereas ongoing research promises further improvements in 
prostate cancer prevention, early detection, and treat-
ment; and 
Whereas educating people in the United States, including 
health care providers, about prostate cancer and early de-
tection strategies is crucial to saving the lives of men and 
preserving and protecting families: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
