1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) According to Article 1, Section 4 of the 
3
Constitution of the United States, the States have 
4
the primary role in establishing ‘‘(t)he Times, Places 
5
and Manners of holding Elections for Senators and 
6
Representatives’’, while Congress has a purely sec-
7
ondary role in this space and must restrain itself 
8
from acting improperly and unconstitutionally.

•HR 8528 IH
(2) Federal election legislation should never be 
1
the first step and must never impose burdensome, 
2
unfunded Federal mandates on State and local elec-
3
tions officials. When Congress does speak, it must 
4
devote its efforts only to resolving highly significant 
5
and substantial deficiencies to ensure the integrity of 
6
our elections. State legislatures are the primary 
7
venues to establish rules for governing elections and 
8
correct most issues. 
9
(3) All eligible voters who wish to participate 
10
must have the opportunity to vote, and all lawful 
11
votes must be counted. 
12
(4) States must balance appropriate election 
13
administration structures and systems with acces-
14
sible access to the ballot box. 
15
(5) Political speech is protected speech. 
16
(6) The First Amendment protects the right of 
17
all Americans to state their political views and do-
18
nate money to the candidates, causes, and organiza-
19
tions of their choice without fear of retribution. 
20
(7) Redistricting decisions are best made at the 
21
State level. 
22
(8) States must maintain the flexibility to de-
23
termine the best redistricting processes for the par-
24
ticular needs of their citizens.

(9) Congress has independent authority under 
1
the Fourteenth, Fifteenth, Nineteenth, Twenty- 
2
Fourth, and Twenty-Sixth Amendments to ensure 
3
elections are conducted without unlawful discrimina-
4
tion. 
5
(10) The Voting Rights Act, which is not an-
6
chored in Article 1, Section 4 of the Constitution, 
7
has seen much success since its first passage in 
8
1965, and Congress should continue to exercise its 
9
constitutional authority in this space as appropriate.

SEC. 101. FINDINGS RELATING TO ELECTION ADMINISTRA-
15
TION. 
16
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
17
gress that constitutional scholar Robert Natelson has done 
18
invaluable work with respect to the history and under-
19
standing of the Elections Clause. 
20
(b) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
21
(1) The Constitution reserves to the States the 
22
primary authority to set election legislation and ad-
23
minister elections—the ‘‘times, places, and manner 
24
of holding of elections’’—and Congress’ power in 
25
17:01 Sep 13, 2022
H8528
8 
•HR 8528 IH
this space is purely secondary to the States’ power 
1
and is to be employed only in the direst of cir-
2
cumstances. History, precedent, the Framers’ words, 
3
debates concerning ratification, the Supreme Court, 
4
and the Constitution itself make it exceedingly clear 
5
that Congress’ power over elections is not unfet-
6
tered. 
7
(2) The Framing Generation grappled with the 
8
failure of the Articles of Confederation, which pro-
9
vided for only a weak national government incapable 
10
of preserving the Union. Under the Articles, the 
11
States had exclusive authority over Federal elections 
12
held within their territory; but, given the difficulties 
13
the national government had experienced with State 
14
cooperation (e.g., the failure of Rhode Island to send 
15
delegates to the Confederation Congress), the Fed-
16
eralists, including Alexander Hamilton, were con-
17
cerned with the possibility that the States, in an ef-
18
fort to destroy the Federal Government, simply 
19
might not hold elections or that an emergency, such 
20
as an invasion or insurrection, might prevent the op-
21
eration of a State’s government, leaving the Con-
22
gress without Members and the Federal Government 
23
unable to respond. 
24

•HR 8528 IH
(3) Quite plainly, Alexander Hamilton, a lead-
1
ing Federalist and proponent of our Constitution, 
2
understood the Elections Clause as serving only as 
3
a sort of emergency fail-safe, not as a cudgel used 
4
to nationalize our elections process. Writing as 
5
Publius to the people of New York, Hamilton fur-
6
ther expounds on the correct understanding of the 
7
Elections Clause: ‘‘T[he] natural order of the subject 
8
leads us to consider, in this place, that provision of 
9
the Constitution which authorizes the national legis-
10
lature to regulate, in the last resort, the election of 
11
its own members.’’. Alexander Hamilton (writing as 
12
Publius), Federalist no. 59, Concerning the Power of 
13
Congress to Regulate the Election of Members, N.Y. 
14
PACKET (Fri., Feb. 22, 1788). 
15
(4) When questioned at the States’ constitu-
16
tional ratifying conventions with respect to this pro-
17
vision, the Federalists confirmed this understanding 
18
of a constitutionally limited, secondary congressional 
19
power under Article 1, Section 4. (‘‘[C]onvention 
20
delegate James McHenry added that the risk to the 
21
federal government [without a fail-safe provision] 
22
might not arise from state malice: An insurrection 
23
or rebellion might prevent a state legislature from 
24
administering an election.’’); (‘‘An occasion may 
25
17:01 Sep 13, 2022
H8528
10 
•HR 8528 IH
arise when the exercise of this ultimate power of 
1
Congress may be necessary . . . if a state should be 
2
involved in war, and its legislature could not assem-
3
ble, (as was the case of South Carolina and occa-
4
sionally of some other states, during the [Revolu-
5
tionary] war).’’); (‘‘Sir, let it be remembered that 
6
this power can only operate in a case of necessity, 
7
after the factious or listless disposition of a par-
8
ticular state has rendered an interference essential 
9
to the salvation of the general government.’’). See 
10
Robert G. Natelson, The Original Scope of the Con-
11
gressional Power to Regulate Elections, 13 U. PA. 
12
J. CONST. L. 1, 12–13 (Nov. 2010). 
13
(5) John Jay made similar claims in New York. 
14
And, as constitutional scholar Robert Natelson notes 
15
in his invaluable article, The Original Scope of the 
16
Congressional Power to Regulate Elections, ‘‘Alex-
17
ander Contee Hanson, a member of Congress whose 
18
pamphlet supporting the Constitution proved pop-
19
ular, stated flatly that Congress would exercise its 
20
times, places, and manner authority only in cases of 
21
invasion, legislative neglect or obstinate refusal to 
22
pass election laws [providing for the election of 
23
Members of Congress], or if a state crafted its elec-
24
tion laws with a ‘sinister purpose’ or to injure the 
25
17:01 Sep 13, 2022
H8528
11 
•HR 8528 IH
general government.’’ Cementing his point, Hanson 
1
goes further to decree, ‘‘The exercise of this power 
2
must at all times be so very invidious, that congress 
3
will not venture upon it without some very cogent 
4
and substantial reason.’’. Alexander Contee Hanson 
5
(writing as Astrides), Remarks on the Proposed 
6
Plan: 31 January, reprinted in John P. Kaminski, 
7
Gaspare J. Saladino, and Richard Leffler (eds.), 3 
8
Commentaries on the Constitution, public and pri-
9
vate 18 December 1787 to 31 January 1788 522– 
10
26 (1984). 
11
(6) In fact, had the alternate view of the Elec-
12
tions Clause been accepted at the time of the Con-
13
stitution’s drafting—that is, that it offers Congress 
14
unfettered power over Federal elections— it is likely 
15
that the Constitution would not have been ratified or 
16
that an amendment to this language would have 
17
been required. 
18
(7) Indeed, at least seven of the original 13 
19
States—over half and enough to prevent the Con-
20
stitution from being ratified—expressed specific con-
21
cerns with the language of the Elections Clause. See 
22
1 Annals of Cong. 799 (1789), Joseph Gales (ed.) 
23
(1834). However, ‘‘[l]eading Federalists . . .’’ as-
24
sured them ‘‘. . . that, even without amendment, 
25
17:01 Sep 13, 2022
H8528
12 
•HR 8528 IH
the [Elections] Clause should be construed as lim-
1
ited to emergencies’’. Three States, New York, 
2
North Carolina, and Rhode Island, specifically made 
3
their ratification contingent on this understanding 
4
being made express. Ratification of the Constitution 
5
by the State of New York (July 26, 1788) (‘‘Under

5
(8) Congress finds that the Framers designed 
6
and the ratifying States understood the Elections 
7
Clause to serve solely as a protective backstop to en-
8
sure the preservation of the Federal Government, 
9
not as a font of limitless power for Congress to 
10
wrest control of Federal elections from the States. 
11
(9) This understanding was also reinforced by 
12
debate during the first Congress that convened 
13
under 
the 
Constitution 
where 
Representative 
14
Aedanus Burke proposed a constitutional amend-
15
ment to limit the Times, Places and Manner Clause 
16
to emergencies. Although the amendment failed, 
17
those on both sides of the Burke amendment debate 
18
already understood the Elections Clause to limit 
19
Federal elections power to emergencies. 
20
(10) History clearly shows that even in the first 
21
Congress that convened under the Constitution, it 
22
was acknowledged and understood through the de-
23
bates that ensued over the Elections Clause provi-
24
sion that Congress’ control over elections is limited. 
25
17:01 Sep 13, 2022
H8528
15 
•HR 8528 IH
(11) Similarly, proponent Representative Smith 
1
of South Carolina also believed the original text of 
2
the Elections Clause already limited the Federal 
3
Government’s power over Federal elections to emer-
4
gencies and so thought there would be no harm in 
5
supporting an amendment to make that language ex-
6
press. Annals of Congress 801 (1789) Joseph Gales 
7
Edition. A Century of Lawmaking for a New Na-
8
tion: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 
9
1774–1875 (loc.gov). So, even the records of the 
10
First Congress reflect a recognition of the emer-
11
gency nature of congressional power over Federal 
12
elections. 
13
(12) Similarly, the Supreme Court has sup-
14
ported this understanding. In Smiley v. Holm, the 
15
Court held that Article 1, Section 4 of the Constitu-
16
tion reserved to the States the primary ‘‘. . . au-
17
thority to provide a complete code for congressional 
18
elections, not only as to times and places, but in re-
19
lation to notices, registration, supervision of voting, 
20
protection of voters, prevention of fraud and corrupt 
21
practices, counting of votes, duties of inspectors and 
22
canvassers, and making and publication of election 
23
returns; in short, to enact the numerous require-
24
ments as to procedure and safeguards which experi-
25
17:01 Sep 13, 2022
H8528
16 
•HR 8528 IH
ence shows are necessary in order to enforce the 
1
fundamental right involved. And these requirements 
2
would be nugatory if they did not have appropriate 
3
sanctions in the definition of offenses and punish-
4
ments. All this is comprised in the subject of ‘times, 
5
places and manner of holding elections’, and involves 
6
lawmaking in its essential features and most impor-
7
tant aspect.’’. Smiley v. Holm, 285 U.S. 355, 366 
8
(1932). 
9
(13) This holding is consistent with the under-
10
standing of the Elections Clause since the framing 
11
of the Constitution. The Smiley Court also held that 
12
while Congress maintains the authority to ‘‘. . . 
13
supplement these state regulations or [to] substitute 
14
its own[]’’, such authority remains merely ‘‘a general 
15
supervisory power over the whole subject.’’. Id. 
16
(14) More recently, the Court noted in Arizona 
17
v. Inter-Tribal Council of Ariz., Inc. that ‘‘[t]his 
18
grant of congressional power [that is, the fail-safe 
19
provision in the Elections Clause] was the Framers’ 
20
insurance against the possibility that a State would 
21
refuse to provide for the election of representatives 
22
to the Federal Congress.’’. Arizona v. Inter-Tribal 
23
Council of Arizona, Inc., 570 U.S. 1, 7–9 (2013). 
24
The Court explained that the Elections Clause ‘‘. . . 
25
17:01 Sep 13, 2022
H8528
17 
•HR 8528 IH
imposes [upon the States] the duty . . . to prescribe 
1
the time, place, and manner of electing Representa-
2
tives and Senators[.]’’. Id. at 8. And, while, as the 
3
Court noted, ‘‘[t]he power of Congress over the 
4
‘Times, Places, and Manner’ of congressional elec-
5
tions is paramount, and may be exercised at any 
6
time, and to any extent which it deems expedient; 
7
and so far as it is exercised, and no farther, the reg-
8
ulations effected supersede those of the State which 
9
are inconsistent therewith[]’’, id. at 9, the Inter- 
10
Tribal Court explained, quoting extensively from the 
11
Federalist no. 59, that it was clear that the congres-
12
sional fail-safe included in the Elections Clause was 
13
intended for the sorts of governmental self-preserva-

(b) FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.— 
23
(1) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
24
17:01 Sep 13, 2022
H8528
24 
•HR 8528 IH
(A) Every eligible person who wishes to 
1
cast a ballot in a Federal election must be per-
2
mitted to do so according to law, and their bal-
3
lot must be examined according to law, and, if 
4
it meets all lawful requirements, counted. 
5
(B) Congress has long required States to 
6
maintain Federal voter registration lists in a 
7
manner that promotes voter confidence. 
8
(C) The changes included herein are not 
9
intended to be an expansion of Federal power 
10
but rather a clarification of State authority. 
11
(D) The Fifteenth Amendment, the Nine-
12
teenth Amendment, the Twenty-Fourth Amend-
13
ment, and the Twenty-Sixth Amendment, 
14
among other references, make clear that the 
15
Constitution prohibits voting by non-citizens in 
16
Federal elections. 
17
(E) Congress has the constitutional au-
18
thority, including under the aforementioned 
19
amendments, to pass statutes preventing non- 
20
citizens from voting in Federal elections, and 
21
did so with the Illegal Immigration Reform and 
22
Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. 
23
(F) Congress may further exercise its con-
24
stitutional authority to ensure the Constitu-
25
17:01 Sep 13, 2022
H8528
25 
•HR 8528 IH
tion’s prohibition on non-citizen voting in Fed-
1
eral elections is upheld. 
2
(G) Since the Constitution prohibits non- 
3
citizens from voting in Federal elections, such 
4
ineligible persons must not be permitted to be 
5
placed on Federal voter registration lists. 
6
(H) Improper placement of an ineligible 
7
non-citizen on a Federal voter registration list 
8
leads to— 
9
(i) confusion on the part of the ineli-
10
gible person with respect to their ineligi-
11
bility to cast a ballot; and 
12
(ii) 
an 
increased 
likelihood 
that 
13
human error will permit ineligible persons 
14
to cast ballots in Federal elections. 
15
(I) State officials have confirmed that 
16
poorly maintained voter registration lists lead to 
17
ineligible persons casting ballots in Federal 
18
elections. 
19
(J) A former Broward County, Florida, 
20
elections supervisor has confirmed that ineli-
21
gible non-voters were able to cast ballots in pre-
22
vious elections and that she was not able to lo-
23
cate as many as 2,040 ballots during the 2018 
24
midterm recount. 
25

26 
•HR 8528 IH
(K) This clarification of State authority to 
1
maintain Federal voter registration lists to en-
2
sure non-citizens are not included on such lists 
3
will promote voter confidence in election proc-
4
esses and outcomes. 
5
(L) Congress has the authority to ensure 
6
that no Federal elections funding is used to 
7
support States that permit non-citizens to cast 
8
ballots in any election. 
9
(M) Federal courts and executive agencies 
10
have much of the information States may need 
11
to maintain their Federal voter registration 
12
lists, and those entities should make that infor-
13
mation accessible to State election authorities. 
14
(N) It is important to clarify the penalty 
15
for any violation of law that allows a non-citizen 
16
to cast a ballot in a Federal election. 
17
(O) To protect the confidence of voters in 
18
Federal elections, it is important to implement 
19
the policy described herein. 
20
(2) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
21
Congress that— 
22
(A) many States have not adequately met 
23
the requirements concerning the removal of in-
24

1
Voter Registration Act of 1993 (52 U.S.C. 
2
20507) and should strive to audit and update 
3
their voter registration rolls on a routine basis; 
4
(B) allowing non-citizens to cast ballots in 
5
American elections weakens our electoral sys-
6
tem and the value of citizenship and sows dis-
7
trust in our elections system; 
8
(C) even if a State has the sovereign au-
9
thority, no State should permit non-citizens to 
10
cast ballots in State or local elections; 
11
(D) States should use all information 
12
available to them to maintain Federal voter reg-
13
istration lists and should inform Congress if 
14
such data is insufficient; and 
15
(E) Congress may take further action in 
16
the future to address this problem.

(a) SHORT TITLE.—This section may be cited as the

6
(b) FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.— 
7
(1) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
8
(A) Photo voter identification programs es-
9
tablished by the States should be administered 
10
without unlawful discrimination and with an 
11
eye toward balancing appropriate access to the 
12
ballot box with election integrity and voter con-
13
fidence goals. 
14
(B) As confirmed by the bipartisan Com-
15
mission on Federal Election Reform (commonly 
16
known as the Carter-Baker Commission), 
17
‘‘[v]oters in nearly 100 democracies use a photo 
18
identification card without fear of infringement 
19
of their rights’’. 
20
(C) As confirmed by the Carter-Baker 
21
Commission, ‘‘[t]he right to vote is a vital com-
22
ponent of U.S. citizenship and all States should 
23
use their best efforts to obtain proof of citizen-
24
ship before registering voters.’’.

•HR 8528 IH
(D) The Carter-Baker Commission was 
1
correct in its 2005 report when it recommended 
2
that the REAL ID Act be ‘‘modestly adapted 
3
for voting purposes to indicate on the front or 
4
back whether the individual is a U.S. citizen.’’. 
5
(E) Congress acknowledges the important 
6
work completed by the Carter-Baker Commis-
7
sion and, by amending the REAL ID Act, re-
8
solves the concerns in the Commission’s report 
9
that ‘‘[t]he REAL ID Act does not require that 
10
the card indicates citizenship, but that would 
11
need to be done if the card is to be used for 
12
voting purposes’’. 
13
(F) Photographic voter identification is im-
14
portant for ensuring voter confidence in election 
15
processes and outcomes. 
16
(G) Requiring photographic voter identi-
17
fication is well within States’ constitutional 
18
competence, including pursuant to the Quali-
19
fications Clause of the Constitution of the 
20
United States (article I, section 2, clause 2), 
21
the Presidential Electors Clause of the Con-
22
stitution (article II, section 1, clause 2), and 
23
the Seventeenth Amendment.

(H) The Fifteenth Amendment, the Nine-
1
teenth Amendment, the Twenty-Fourth Amend-
2
ment, and the Twenty-Sixth Amendment, 
3
among other references, make clear that the 
4
Constitution prohibits voting by non-citizens in 
5
Federal elections. 
6
(I) Congress has the constitutional author-
7
ity, including under the aforementioned amend-
8
ments, to pass statutes preventing non-citizens 
9
from voting in Federal elections, and did so 
10
with the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immi-
11
grant Responsibility Act of 1996. 
12
(J) Congress may further exercise its con-
13
stitutional authority to ensure the Constitu-
14
tion’s prohibition on non-citizen voting in Fed-
15
eral elections is upheld. 
16
(2) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
17
Congress that the States should implement the sub-
18
stance of the recommendation of the Carter-Baker 
19
Commission that, ‘‘[t]o ensure that persons pre-
20
senting themselves at the polling place are the ones 
21
on the registration list, the Commission recommends 
22
that states [encourage] voters to use the REAL ID 
23
card, which was mandated in a law signed by the 
24
President in May 2005’’.

20
the election of members to each House, each House

6
than 100 election contests have been filed with the

9
sent out official congressional observers to watch the

administration of congressional elections in the

States and territories.

develop its own factual record in preparation for

eventual contests and for other reasons.

(1) the right to vote is a fundamental right of

citizens of the United States, as described by the 
15
Constitution of the United States; 
16
(2) the Committee on House Administration of 
17
the House of Representatives, which is charged with 
18
investigating election irregularities, received reports 
19
through its official Election Observer Program for 
20
the 2018 general election and the 2020 general elec-
21
tion, as well as from other stakeholders, that individ-
22
uals other than voters themselves were depositing 
23
large amounts of absentee ballots at polling places 
24
throughout California and other States, a practice 
25
colloquially known as ‘‘ballot harvesting’’; 
26
17:01 Sep 13, 2022
H8528
67 
•HR 8528 IH
(3) the practice of ballot harvesting creates sig-
1
nificant vulnerabilities in the chain-of-custody of bal-
2
lots because individuals collecting ballots are not re-
3
quired to be registered voters and are not required 
4
to identify themselves at a voter’s home, and the 
5
State does not track how many ballots are harvested 
6
in an election; 
7
(4) in North Carolina, a congressional election 
8
was invalidated due to fraud associated with ballot 
9
harvesting committed by a political operative, and it 
10
is unlikely such activity would have been detected 
11
were it not for the prohibition against ballot har-
12
vesting in the State; 
13
(5) ballot harvesting invites electioneering activ-
14
ity at home and weakens States’ long-standing voter 
15
protection procedures, which remain in place at poll-
16
ing locations, creating the possibility of undue influ-
17
ence over voters by political operatives and other bad 
18
actors; and

18
its core statutory functions, including serving as a 
19
clearinghouse for information on election administra-

tion, providing grants, and testing and certifying 
1
election equipment. 
2
(2) The American people are best served when 
3
Federal agency election assistance is offered by a 
4
single agency with expertise in this space. The Elec-
5
tion Assistance Commission, composed of four elec-
6
tion experts from different political parties, is best 
7
situated among the Federal Government agencies to 
8
offer assistance services to citizens and to guide 
9
other Federal agencies that have responsibilities in 
10
the elections space. The Commission is also best 
11
suited to determine the timing of the issuance of any 
12
advisories and to disburse all appropriated election 
13
grant funding. 
14
(3) To this end, Congress finds that the Elec-
15
tion Assistance Commission should be viewed as the 
16
lead Federal Government agency on all election ad-
17
ministration matters, and other Federal agencies op-
18
erating in this space should look to the Commission 
19
for guidance, direction, and support on election ad-
20

Subtitle A—Findings Relating to

13
SEC. 201. FINDINGS RELATING TO MILITARY VOTING. 
14
Congress finds the following: 
15
(1) Participation in the voting process by Amer-
16
icans who serve in the Armed Forces is vital to the 
17
future of the Republic; however, due to the realities 
18
of service around the globe and despite many best 
19
efforts, the Nation has not always lived up to its 
20
commitment to servicemembers that their vote be 
21
counted. 
22
(2) The Military and Overseas Empowerment 
23
(MOVE) Act made great progress in solving prob-
24
lems with voting that many servicemembers faced.

112 
•HR 8528 IH
Yet, for many, it is still difficult to exercise the fran-
1
chise, with many ballots not reaching State elections 
2
officials until after the deadline, negating their voice. 
3
After 13 years, Congress must address the remain-
4
ing issues. 
5
(3) Congress finds that it is a moral imperative 
6
of national importance that every eligible American 
7
servicemember has the opportunity to cast a ballot 
8
in each election and, not only that such ballot be re-
9
ceived in time to be counted, but that it actually be 
10
counted according to law.

LITICAL SPEECH AND CAM-
9
PAIGN FINANCE REFORM 
10
Subtitle A—Protecting Political 
11
Speech 
12
SEC. 301. FINDINGS. 
13
Congress finds the following: 
14
(1) The structure of the Constitution and its 
15
amendments represents the radical idea that any 
16
sovereign power exercised by the Federal Govern-
17
ment flows either directly from the people or 
18
through the States they established to govern them-
19
selves. In the words of the Ninth and Tenth Amend-
20
ments, ‘‘[t]he enumeration in the Constitution, of 
21
certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or dis-
22
parage others retained by the people.’’ ‘‘The powers 
23
not delegated to the United States by the Constitu-
24
17:01 Sep 13, 2022
H8528
114 
•HR 8528 IH
tion, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved 
1
to the States respectively, or to the people.’’ 
2
(2) Among the many freedoms it protects, the 
3
First Amendment prevents Congress from making 
4
any law abridging the freedom of speech, the right 
5
of the people peaceably to assemble, or the right of 
6
the people to petition the Government for the re-
7
dress of grievances. 
8
(3) Any proposed Federal action concerning 
9
freedom of speech, protest, or petition must start 
10
with an analysis of the First Amendment. Congress 
11
must ask whether the proposed action would abridge 
12
these freedoms, and any uncertainty must be deter-
13
mined in favor of fewer restrictions on speech. 
14
(4) In particular, political speech, uttered in the 
15
furtherance of self-government, must raise an even 
16
higher bar to congressional abridgement. The mech-
17
anisms and media used to offer political speech must 
18
realize the same protections. 
19
(5) As the Supreme Court has recognized, the 
20
Constitution grants Congress only a very narrow in-
21
terest in the regulation of political speech, the pre-
22
vention of corruption or the appearance of corrup-
23
tion. 
24
17:01 Sep 13, 2022
H8528
115 
•HR 8528 IH
(6) In order to uphold and effectuate the Con-
1
stitution, any Federal statute that goes beyond this 
2
interest must be repealed, and Congress must exer-
3
cise its Article 1 authorities to do so.

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
19
(1) While Federal law permits the Federal 
20
Election Commission to engage in certain ‘‘gap-fill-
21
ing’’ activities as it administers the Federal Election 
22
Campaign Act of 1971, the regulations promulgated 
23

are not tied specifically to any particular provision 
1
of the Act, and while these regulations generally du-
2
plicate the provisions of the Act, they also impose 
3
additional and unnecessary burdens on political com-
4
mittees which seek to engage in joint fundraising ac-
5
tivities, such as a requirement for written agree-
6
ments between the participating committees. 
7
(2) It is therefore not necessary at this time to 
8
direct the Federal Election Commission to repeal the 
9
existing regulations which govern joint fundraising 
10
activities of multiple political committees, as some 
11
political committees may have reasons for following 
12
the provisions of such regulations which impose ad-
13
ditional and unnecessary burdens on these activities.

15
