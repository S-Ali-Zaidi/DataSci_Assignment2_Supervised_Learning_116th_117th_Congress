SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds as follows: 
2
(1) In the 1980s and 1990s, pharmaceutical 
3
companies began developing new drugs for pain 
4
treatment, including extended release oxycodone. 
5
These companies aggressively marketed these drugs 
6
to the medical community as a way to address 
7
‘‘under-treatment’’ of physical pain. Drug companies 
8
distributed 
76,000,000,000 
oxycodone 
and 
9
hydrocodone pain pills nationwide from 2006 to 
10
2012. 
11
(2) The combination of a rising number of pre-
12
scriptions, misinformation about the addictive prop-
13
erties of prescription opioids, and the perception 
14
that prescription drugs are less harmful than illicit 
15
drugs has caused an increase in drug misuse. 
16
23:47 Jul 31, 2021
H4341

•HR 4341 IH
(3) As legitimate production and illegal diver-
1
sion of opioids skyrocketed, so did the number of 
2
opioid overdose deaths. From 1999 to 2017, almost 
3
218,000 people died in the United States from 
4
overdoses related to prescription opioids. More re-
5
cently, fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid, sur-
6
passed prescription opioids as the most lethal over-
7
dose substance and now is linked to nearly 3 times 
8
as many deaths. 
9
(4) The scale of the opioid crisis is staggering: 
10
(A) In 2018, approximately 10,300,000 
11
people in the United States age 12 and older 
12
misused opioids. 
13
(B) On average, 130 people in the United 
14
States die every day from an opioid overdose. 
15
(C) The opioid crisis has cost the United 
16
States economy at least $631,000,000,000. 
17
(D) From 2013 to 2017, the number of 
18
children in foster care nationwide increased 10 
19
percent to nearly 442,995. Parental drug use 
20
was cited as a factor in 36 percent of cases. 
21
(5) The opioid crisis has also led to a cascade 
22
of other negative health impacts. For example, sy-
23
ringe sharing among people who inject drugs has led 
24
23:47 Jul 31, 2021
H4341
5 
•HR 4341 IH
to increases in hepatitis C virus infections and infec-
1
tive endocarditis, as well as localized HIV outbreaks. 
2
(6) The United States health care system has 
3
struggled to catch up to the crisis: 
4
(A) The majority of people in the United 
5
States with an opioid use disorder do not re-
6
ceive substance use treatment, and many who 
7
do receive such treatment do not receive evi-
8
dence-based treatment. Although medication-as-
9
sisted treatment has been endorsed by the Na-
10
tional Institutes of Health and the World 
11
Health Organization, only one-third of treat-
12
ment programs offer any of the 3 drugs ap-
13
proved by the Food and Drug Administration 
14
for the treatment of opioid use disorder, and 
15
just 6 percent of medication-offering facilities 
16
provide all 3. 
17
(B) Facilities that provide medications for 
18
the treatment of opioid disorder are con-
19
centrated in the Northeast and Southwest, leav-
20
ing many of the areas hit hardest by the opioid 
21
crisis without access to evidence-based treat-
22
ment. The need is particularly acute in rural 
23
areas, which often do not have enough providers 
24
to meet the demand. 
25
23:47 Jul 31, 2021
H4341

•HR 4341 IH
(C) Unlike other health care needs, sub-
1
stance use treatment is largely funded by State 
2
and local revenues and Federal block grants, 
3
rather than the Medicare program, the Med-
4
icaid program, and private insurance. 
5
(D) While new substances, particularly 
6
synthetic drugs, continue to make inroads into 
7
communities in the United States, funding 
8
streams are often dedicated to particular sub-
9
stances, limiting providers’ ability to adapt to 
10
changing needs. 
11
(E) The stigma associated with substance 
12
use disorder prevents people from seeking treat-
13
ment. Too often, people enter substance use 
14
treatment only after committing a criminal of-
15
fense, whether through a court mandate, as a 
16
condition of parole or probation supervision, or 
17
as a condition of regaining employment after 
18
conviction. In 2003, 36 percent of all substance 
19
use treatment admissions, 40 percent of all al-
20
cohol abuse treatment admissions, and 57 per-
21
cent of all marijuana use treatment admissions 
22
were referrals from the criminal justice system. 
23
(F) The stigma of substance use disorder 
24
also limits people’s ability to find jobs and 
25
23:47 Jul 31, 2021
H4341

•HR 4341 IH
housing. These obstacles are exacerbated by the 
1
criminalization of substance use disorder—even 
2
convictions for drug possession for personal use 
3
can create lifelong collateral consequences. The 
4
absence of stable housing and employment 
5
make it even more difficult for people to live 
6
drug free. 
7
(7) Not all people in the United States have 
8
equal access to substance use treatment in the com-
9
munity. Current research has found that Black and 
10
Latinx Americans are less likely to receive substance 
11
use treatment when controlling for other relevant 
12
factors, like socioeconomic status. 
13
(8) Inadequate access to substance use treat-
14
ment can exacerbate other health disparities. Indi-
15
viduals with substance use disorders have higher 
16
rates of suicide attempts than individuals in the gen-
17
eral population, high health care expenses, and sig-
18
nificant disability. 
19
(9) A comprehensive public health approach 
20
that tackles both the causes and the consequences of 
21
substance use disorder is necessary to stem the tide.

SEC. 402. DEFLECTION AND PRE-ARREST DIVERSION. 
5
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) Law enforcement officers and other first re-
7
sponders are at the front line of the opioid epidemic. 
8
However, a traditional law enforcement response to 
9
substance use often fails to disrupt the cycle of ad-
10
diction and arrest, or reduce the risk of overdose. 
11
(2) Law enforcement-assisted deflection and di-
12
version programs have the potential to improve pub-
13
lic health, decrease the number of people entering 
14
the criminal justice system for low-level offenses, 
15
and address racial disparities. 
16
(3) According to the Bureau of Justice Assist-
17
ance of the Department of Justice, ‘‘Five pathways 
18
have been most commonly associated with opioid 
19
overdose prevention and diversion to treatment.’’ 
20
The 5 pathways are— 
21
(A) ‘‘self-referral’’, in which— 
22
(i) an individual voluntarily initiates 
23
contact with a first responder, such as a 
24
law enforcement officer, firefighter, or 
25

1
for a treatment referral (without fear of 
2
arrest); and 
3
(ii) the first responder personally in-
4
troduces the individual to a treatment pro-
5
vider (commonly known as a ‘‘warm hand-
6
off’’); 
7
(B) ‘‘active outreach’’, in which a law en-
8
forcement officer or other first responder— 
9
(i) identifies or seeks out individuals 
10
in need of substance use disorder treat-
11
ment; and 
12
(ii) makes a warm handoff of such an 
13
individual to a treatment provider, who en-
14
gages the individual in treatment; 
15
(C) ‘‘naloxone plus’’, in which a law en-
16
forcement officer or other first responder en-
17
gages an individual in treatment as a follow-up 
18
to an overdose response; 
19
(D) ‘‘officer prevention referral’’, in which 
20
a law enforcement officer or other first re-
21
sponder initiates treatment engagement with an 
22
individual, but no criminal charges are filed 
23
against the individual; and

(ii)(I) criminal charges are filed
