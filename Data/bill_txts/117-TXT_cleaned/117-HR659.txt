Whereas grandparents and other relatives residing in urban, 
rural, and suburban households in every county of the 
United States have stepped forward out of love and loy-
alty to care for children during times in which biological 
parents are unable to do so; 
Whereas kinship caregivers provide safety, promote well- 
being, and establish stable households for vulnerable chil-
dren; 
Whereas kinship care enables a child— 
(1) to maintain family relationships and cultural 
heritage; and 
(2) to remain in the community of the child; 
Whereas kinship care is a national resource that provides lov-
ing homes for children at risk; 
Whereas kinship caregivers face daunting challenges to keep 
countless children from entering foster care; 
Whereas the House of Representatives is proud to recognize 
the many kinship care families in which a child is raised 
by grandparents or other relatives; 
Whereas the House of Representatives wishes to honor the 
many kinship caregivers who throughout the history of 
the United States have provided loving homes for 
parentless children; 
Whereas National Kinship Care Month provides an oppor-
tunity to urge people in every State to join in recognizing 
and celebrating kinship caregiving families and the tradi-
tion of families in the United States to help raise chil-
dren; 
Whereas much remains to be done to ensure that all children 
have a safe, loving, nurturing, and permanent family, re-
gardless of age or special needs;

•HRES 659 IH 
Whereas, during the COVID–19 pandemic, kinship caregivers 
who are often older grandparents with health vulnerabili-
ties are parenting children in their homes, often without 
supports; 
Whereas, since more that 40 States and the District of Co-
lumbia have over 300 laws related to kinship caregiving 
and there are many Federal child welfare laws, it is clear 
that kinship care is acknowledged as the nationally ac-
cepted term for grandparents, relatives, and fictive kin 
who are caring for children; 
Whereas over 40 States are implementing kinship navigator 
services that support kinship caregivers who are not fos-
ter parents; and 
Whereas States increasingly rely on kin as foster parents, 
and are working to increase the percentages of kinship 
foster care: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the designation of ‘‘National Kin-
2
ship Care Month’’; 
3
(2) encourages the Congress to implement poli-
4
cies to improve the lives of vulnerable children and 
5
families; 
6
(3) honors the commitment and dedication of 
7
kinship caregivers and the advocates and allies who 
8
work tirelessly to provide assistance and services to 
9
kinship caregiving families; and 
10
(4) reaffirms the need to continue working to 
11
improve the outcomes of all vulnerable children
