RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the designation of the week of 
October 24, 2022, to October 31, 2022, as ‘‘Bat Week’’. 
Whereas bats are vital to the sustainability of natural eco-
systems, national economies, and human health by con-
trolling damaging insect pests, pollinating plants that 
produce fruits and vegetables, dispersing seeds to ensure 
healthy functioning forests and fields, and saving farmers 
in the United States more than $3,000,000,000 in pest 
control every year; 
Whereas bats have captured the human imagination through 
backyard sightings, folklore, art, myths, and legends, 
making outreach and education about the importance of 
bats instrumental;

Whereas bats are present throughout the world, except in ex-
tremely cold regions, and are the second-largest order of 
mammals with over 1,400 species; 
Whereas white-nose syndrome, a fungal disease that has 
killed millions of bats in North America, has now spread 
to 38 States and 12 species of hibernating bats; 
Whereas the disease has caused significant declines in popu-
lations of the tricolored bat, the little brown bat, and the 
northern long-eared bat, which is listed as threatened 
under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 
1531 et seq.); 
Whereas the Department of the Interior, through the United 
States Fish and Wildlife Service, United States Geologi-
cal Survey, National Park Service, and Bureau of Land 
Management, is leading the international response to the 
disease in partnership with the Forest Service and more 
than 150 Federal and State agencies, Tribes, nongovern-
mental organizations, and universities; 
Whereas the United States Geological Survey and the United 
States Fish and Wildlife Service colead the multinational, 
multiagency North American Bat Monitoring Program 
(NABat) which, since 2015, has consolidated nearly 
68,000,000 records from partners in 49 States, 8 Cana-
dian Provinces, and 10 Tribal organizations, dem-
onstrating the power of collaborative conservation science 
to monitor changes in North American bat populations; 
Whereas the United States Geological Survey conducts sci-
entific research on bats that helps resource managers and 
policymakers make informed decisions regarding the con-
servation of bats across North America; and

ending this epidemic: Now, therefore, be it
