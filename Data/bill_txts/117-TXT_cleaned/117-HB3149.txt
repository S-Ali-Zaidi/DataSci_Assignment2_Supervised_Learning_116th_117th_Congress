A BILL 
To expand access to health care services for immigrants 
by removing legal and policy barriers to health insurance 
coverage, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Health Equity and 
4
Access under the Law for Immigrant Families Act of 
5
2021’’ or the ‘‘HEAL for Immigrant Families Act of 
6
2021’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE. 
8
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds as follows: 
9
(1) Health insurance coverage reduces harmful 
10
racial, economic, gender, and health inequities by al-
11
leviating cost barriers to, and increasing utilization 
12
of, necessary health care services, especially among 
13
low-income and underserved populations. 
14
(2) Based solely on their immigration status, 
15
many immigrants and their families face legal and 
16
policy restrictions on their ability to obtain afford-
17
able health insurance coverage through Medicaid, 
18
the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), 
19
and the health insurance exchanges.

(3) Lack of health insurance coverage contrib-
1
utes to persistent inequities in the prevention, diag-
2
nosis, and treatment of health conditions. This leads 
3
to negative health outcomes for immigrants and 
4
their families, especially Black, Indigenous, Latinx, 
5
Asian, Pacific Islander, and other Immigrants of 
6
Color. 
7
(4) Black immigrant women often cite cost as 
8
a major barrier to health care. Many who are un-
9
documented forgo doctor visits altogether due to the 
10
financial burden in addition to consistent racial bias 
11
by medical practitioners and racism in health care. 
12
(5) Nearly half of immigrant women are of re-
13
productive age. Immigrant women, lesbian, gay, bi-
14
sexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) immi-
15
grants, and immigrants with disabilities dispropor-
16
tionately live in households with low incomes and 
17
lack health insurance coverage. Legal and policy bar-
18
riers to affordable health insurance coverage signifi-
19
cantly exacerbate their risk of negative pregnancy- 
20
related and other reproductive and sexual health 
21
outcomes, with lasting health and economic con-
22
sequences for immigrant women, LGBTQ immi-
23
grants, immigrants with disabilities, and their fami-
24
lies and society as a whole.

(6) Immigrants who identify as LGBTQ experi-
1
ence compounding discrimination from health care 
2
providers and systems based on race and ethnicity, 
3
primary language, immigration status, sexual ori-
4
entation, and gender identity. Nearly one in five 
5
transgender patients have been refused care due to 
6
their gender non-conforming status, and providers 
7
have denied care to undocumented immigrants be-
8
cause of immigration status. These inequities are ex-
9
acerbated by legal and policy barriers that restrict 
10
access to health coverage on the basis of immigra-
11
tion status, exposing LGBTQ immigrant commu-
12
nities to disproportionate gaps in affordable, com-
13
prehensive health care. These compounding barriers 
14
are especially harmful for LGBTQ immigrants who 
15
are escaping interpersonal and state violence due to 
16
their sexual orientation and gender identity. 
17
(7) Denying health insurance coverage or im-
18
posing waiting periods for health insurance coverage 
19
on the basis of immigration status unfairly hinders 
20
immigrants’ ability to reach and maintain their opti-
21
mal levels of health and undermines the economic 
22
well-being of their families. 
23
(8) International human rights standards hold 
24
that governments have an affirmative obligation to 
25

ensure that everyone, including immigrants, can ac-
1
cess safe, respectful, culturally and linguistically ap-
2
propriate, and high-quality pregnancy-related care, 
3
including postpartum care, free from discrimination 
4
or violence. Medicaid is the nation’s single largest 
5
payer for pregnancy-related care. Nevertheless, bar-
6
riers to health coverage persist for pregnant and 
7
postpartum people, particularly immigrants. 
8
(9) Immigrants—especially Black, Indigenous, 
9
Latinx, Asian, and Pacific Islander immigrants—are 
10
among those most harmed by the United States’ 
11
pregnancy-related morbidity and mortality epidemic, 
12
which is the worst among high-income nations. 
13
Black people are nearly four times more likely than 
14
white people to suffer pregnancy-related death, and 
15
twice as likely to suffer maternal morbidity. Indige-
16
nous people are two and a half times more likely 
17
than white people to die from a pregnancy-related 
18
death. The majority of United States pregnancy-re-
19
lated deaths are preventable. Lack of access to 
20
health care, immigration status, poverty, and expo-
21
sure to racism, sexism, and xenophobia in and be-
22
yond the health care system contribute to the dis-
23
proportionately high number of pregnancy-related 
24
deaths among BIPOC birthing and postpartum peo-

ple. Unnecessary barriers that limit pregnant and 
1
postpartum immigrants’ access to health care under-
2
mine their health, safety, and human rights. 
3
(10) One in seven United States residents is 
4
foreign-born, approximately one in four children in 
5
the United States has at least one immigrant par-
6
ent, and the population of immigrant families in the 
7
United States is expected to continue to grow in the 
8
coming years. It is therefore in our collective public 
9
health and economic interest to remove legal and 
10
policy barriers to affordable health insurance cov-
11
erage that are based on immigration status. 
12
(11) Although individuals granted relief under 
13
the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) 
14
program are authorized to live and work in the 
15
United States, they have been unfairly excluded 
16
from the definitions of lawfully present and lawfully 
17
residing for purposes of health insurance coverage 
18
provided through the Department of Health and 
19
Human Services, including Medicaid, CHIP, and the 
20
health insurance exchanges. 
21
(12) Since immigration law evolves constantly, 
22
new immigration categories for individuals with fed-
23
erally authorized presence in the United States may 
24
be created.

(13) Some States continue to unwisely restrict 
1
Medicaid access for immigrants who have long re-
2
sided in the United States, fueling significant health 
3
inequities and increasing health care costs for indi-
4
viduals and the public. 
5
(14) Congress restored Medicaid eligibility for 
6
individuals living in the United States under the 
7
Compacts of Free Association as part of bipartisan 
8
legislation in December 2020 and should build on 
9
that success by ensuring all immigrants can access 
10
care. 
11
(b) PURPOSE.—It is the purpose of this Act to— 
12
(1) ensure that all individuals who are lawfully 
13
present in the United States are eligible for all fed-
14
erally funded health care programs; 
15
(2) advance the ability of undocumented indi-
16
viduals to obtain health insurance coverage through 
17
the health insurance exchanges established under 
18
part II of the Patient Protection and Affordable 
19
Care Act, Public Law 111–148; 
20
(3) eliminate the authority for States to restrict 
21
Medicaid eligibility for lawful permanent residents;

and

(4) eliminate other barriers to accessing Med-
24
