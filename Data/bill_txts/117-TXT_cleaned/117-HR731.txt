RESOLUTION 
To recognize the centennial of the Tomb of the Unknown 
Soldier. 
Whereas, on October 24, 1921, the body of one unidentified 
member of the Armed Forces who died during World 
War I was selected as the United States Unknown Sol-
dier; 
Whereas, on November 11, 1921, the Unknown Soldier from 
World War I was placed on a horse-drawn caisson and 
carried in a procession through the District of Columbia 
and across the Potomac River; 
Whereas a state funeral ceremony was held that day at Ar-
lington National Cemetery’s new Memorial Amphitheater, 
and the Unknown Soldier was interred in the Tomb of 
the Unknown Soldier; 
Whereas, in March 1926, soldiers from nearby forts were 
first assigned to guard the Tomb of the Unknown Sol-
dier, where guards presented only during visiting hours 
and discouraged visitors from disrespecting the tomb, and 
in 1937, the guards began a continuous presence, stand-
ing watch over the tomb at all times; 
Whereas the Nation observed two minutes of silence during 
the ceremony for the burial of the World War I Un-
known, and President Warren G. Harding spoke at the 
ceremony and placed the Medal of Honor, the Nation’s 
highest military decoration, on the casket; 
Whereas, following World War II, many Americans supported 
interring and honoring an Unknown from that war; how-
ever, the start of the Korean war in 1950 delayed those 
plans;

Vietnam War; 
Whereas, on May 28, 1984, an unidentified member of the

Lt. Michael J. Blassie, and reburied in Jefferson Bar-
racks National Cemetery, with the empty crypt subse-
quently capped with an engraved cover to honor all miss-
ing members of the Armed Forces from the Vietnam 
War; 
Whereas, since the creation of the Tomb of the Unknown Sol-
dier, millions of visitors have come to Arlington National 
Cemetery to mourn and pay their respects to the Un-
known Soldier and the military personnel he represents; 
and 
Whereas 100 years after the burial of the Unknown Soldier 
from World War I, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier 
continues to be a powerful symbol of service and sac-
rifice, mourning, and memory: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
