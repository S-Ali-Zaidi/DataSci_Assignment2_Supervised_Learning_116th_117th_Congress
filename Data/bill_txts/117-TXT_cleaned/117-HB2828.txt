SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds as follows: 
2
(1) Dairy products are an important part of a 
3
healthy diet for both children and adults, according 
4
to the 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans 
5
(referred to in this section as the ‘‘Dietary Guide-
6
lines’’) published by the Department of Agriculture 
7
and the Department of Health and Human Services. 
8
The Dietary Guidelines state that most Americans 
9
are not meeting recommended intake for the dairy 
10
food group. 
11
(2) Consumption of dairy foods provides numer-
12
ous health benefits, including lowering the risk of di-
13
abetes, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, 
14
and obesity. 
15
(3) The Dietary Guidelines state that dairy 
16
foods are sources of critical nutrients for human 
17
health, including vitamin D, calcium, and potassium, 
18
all of which are under consumed by people of the 
19
United States. Even though average consumption 
20
falls short of amounts recommended by the Food 
21
Patterns of the Department of Agriculture, on aver-
22
age across the calorie levels dairy foods still con-
23
tribute about 68 percent of calcium, 76 percent of 
24
vitamin D, and 31 percent of magnesium.

(4) Beginning at age nine and persisting 
1
throughout every subsequent life-stage, individuals 
2
in the United States on average fail to meet the rec-
3
ommended amount of dairy intake for their age 
4
group, according to the Dietary Guidelines. The Die-
5
tary Guidelines note the gap between recommended 
6
and current intake of dairy widens throughout life 
7
stages and find the age-related decreasing intake of 
8
dairy for youth ages 2–18 to be ‘‘notable and con-
9
cerning’’. Overall, approximately 90 percent of the 
10
entire population of the United States does not meet 
11
the daily dairy intake recommendation. 
12
(5) The Dietary Guidelines state that the nutri-
13
ent composition of dairy foods highlights the impor-
14
tance of adequate consumption, finding this to be es-
15
pecially relevant for the intake of calcium and vita-
16
min D throughout an individual’s life. The Dietary 
17
Guidelines note that calcium and vitamin D are im-
18
portant at any age, that adolescents have an in-
19
creased need for these nutrients to support accrual 
20
of bone mass, and that adults should give particular 
21
attention to consuming adequate amounts of foods 
22
with these nutrients to promote optimal bone health 
23
and prevent the onset of osteoporosis. Yet, close to 
24
30 percent of men and 60 percent of women older 
25

•HR 2828 IH
than age 19 do not consume enough calcium, and 
1
more than 90 percent do not consume enough vita-
2
min D. According to the Dietary Guidelines, dietary 
3
patterns that do not meet recommended consump-
4
tion amounts for food groups and subgroups which 
5
include sources of calcium and vitamin D, such as 
6
dairy foods, contribute to low intake of these nutri-
7
ents. 
8
(6) The Dietary Guidelines state that many 
9
products sold as ‘‘milks’’ but made from plants (e.g., 
10
almond, rice, coconut, oat, and hemp ‘‘milks’’) do 
11
not have an overall nutritional content similar to 
12
real milk and that most have significantly less pro-
13
tein than real milk and are not always fortified with 
14
calcium and vitamin D. The amount of calcium per 
15
calorie is lower for most plant-based alternative milk 
16
products. To obtain the amount of calcium contained 
17
in one cup of nonfat fluid milk from a plant-based 
18
milk alternative, the portion size and calorie intake 
19
must be greater. 
20
(7) Similarly, imitation dairy products, such as 
21
plant-based products derived from rice, nuts, soy-
22
beans, hemp, coconut, algae, and other foods that 
23
imitate milk, yogurt, and cheese, often do not pro-
24

•HR 2828 IH
vide the same nutrition content as real cheese and 
1
yogurt derived from dairy cows. 
2
(8) Plant-based products labeled as milk are 
3
misleading to consumers. 
4
(9) The Food and Drug Administration has 
5
regulations that define milk and cream as the ‘‘lac-
6
teal secretion, practically free from colostrum, ob-
7
tained by the complete milking of one or more 
8
healthy cows’’ (section 131.110 of title 21, Code of 
9
Federal Regulations). This definition further applies 
10
to milk used to create other dairy products, includ-
11
ing yogurt and cheese, as specified in sections 131 
12
and 133 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations. 
13
(10) Given the proliferation of plant-based 
14
products in the marketplace that are mislabeled as 
15
milk despite the standard of identity defined for this 
16
substance, enforcement by the Food and Drug Ad-
17
ministration against these practices should be im-
18
proved to avoid misleading consumers.

21

a dairy product if the food does not meet the criterion 
23
set forth for dairy products under paragraph (z)(2) of sec-

10
‘‘(2) For purposes of this paragraph, a food is a dairy 
11
product only if the food is, contains as a primary ingre-
12
dient, or is derived from, the lacteal secretion, practically 
13
free from colostrum, obtained by the complete milking of 
14
one or more hooved mammals. 
15
‘‘(3) A market name for a dairy product described 
16
in this subparagraph means the dairy product terms de-
17

18

19
135.110, 135.115, and 135.140 of title 21, Code of Fed-

23
lated with a dairy product (as described in subparagraph
