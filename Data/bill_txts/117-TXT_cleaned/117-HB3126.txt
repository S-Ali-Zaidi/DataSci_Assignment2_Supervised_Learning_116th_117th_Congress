SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Healthy Maternity and 
2
Obstetric Medicine Act’’ or the ‘‘Healthy MOM Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. 
4
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) Pregnancy is a significant life event for mil-
6
lions of women in the United States each year. 
7
(2) For more than 30 years, our Nation, 
8
through the Medicaid program, has recognized that 
9
pregnant women need immediate access to afford-
10
able care, and has allowed women who meet income- 
11
eligibility requirements to enroll in Medicaid cov-
12
erage when they become pregnant. 
13
(3) Congress recognized the central importance 
14
of maternity coverage by classifying maternity and 
15
newborn care as one of the ten essential health bene-
16
fits that must now be covered on most individual 
17
and small group health insurance plans under sec-
18
tion 1302(b)(1) of the Patient Protection and Af-
19
fordable Care Act (42 U.S.C. 18022(b)(1)). 
20
(4) Congress has also recognized the significant 
21
challenge of maternal mortality and the need to 
22
eliminate disparities in maternal health outcomes for 
23
pregnancy-related and pregnancy-associated deaths, 
24
and to improve health outcomes for both mothers

and babies through passage of the Preventing Ma-
1
ternal Deaths Act of 2018 (Public Law 115–344). 
2
(5) Access to comprehensive maternity coverage 
3
allows women to access important pregnancy-related 
4
care, which is demonstrated to improve health out-
5
comes for women and newborns and reduce financial 
6
costs for both consumers and insurers. 
7
(6) Uninsured women, women with grand-
8
fathered and transitional health plans, self-funded 
9
student health plans, and catastrophic and high-de-
10
ductible health plans may lack access to comprehen-
11
sive and affordable maternity coverage. 
12
(7) Employer health plans that exclude depend-
13
ent daughters from maternity coverage leave young 
14
women without coverage for their pregnancy, even 
15
though Federal law has long held that treating preg-
16
nancy differently than other conditions is sex-based 
17
discrimination. 
18
(8) A special enrollment period is especially im-
19
portant for young adults, who are at high risk for 
20
unintended pregnancies, yet young adults are fre-
21
quently enrolled in catastrophic coverage, which 
22
often has fewer benefits, more restrictions, and high-
23
er deductibles. 
24

•HR 3126 IH
(9) This coverage would be an equalizer for 
1
communities of color. The maternal mortality rate 
2
varies drastically by race and ethnicity, and where a 
3
woman lives. The rising maternal mortality rate in 
4
the United States is driven predominantly by the 
5
disproportionately high African-American maternal 
6
mortality rate, which is four times more than the 
7
rate for White women. 
8
(10) According to the Centers for Disease Con-
9
trol and Prevention, about 700 women die each year 
10
in the United States from pregnancy-related com-
11
plications. Black and American Indian/Alaska Native 
12
women are about three times more likely to die from 
13
a pregnancy-related cause than White women. 
14
(11) Data demonstrates that 3 in 5 pregnancy 
15
related deaths could be prevented. Improving access 
16
to care is one way to help prevent deaths, regardless 
17
of race or ethnicity. 
18
(12) Timely maternity care improves the health 
19
of pregnant women, as well as birth outcomes and 
20
the health of babies throughout their lifetimes. Preg-
21
nancy-related maternal mortality is three to four 
22
times higher among women who receive no maternity 
23
care compared to women who do. Regular maternity 
24
care can detect or mitigate serious pregnancy-related 
25

•HR 3126 IH
health complications, including preeclampsia, pla-
1
cental abruption, complications from diabetes, com-
2
plications from heart disease, and Graves’ disease, 
3
all of which can result in morbidity or mortality for 
4
the mother or newborn. 
5
(13) The Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
6
vention reports that more than half of all maternal 
7
deaths occur at delivery or in the first postpartum 
8
year, whereas just more than one-third of preg-
9
nancy-related or pregnancy-associated deaths occur 
10
while a person is still pregnant. Yet, for women eligi-
11
ble for the Medicaid program on the basis of preg-
12
nancy, such Medicaid coverage lapses at the end of 
13
the month on which the 60th postpartum day lands. 
14
(14) Timely maternity care and adequate 
15
postpartum care can reduce short- and long-term 
16
health care costs. If a woman does not have access 
17
to affordable maternity care during her pregnancy, 
18
and she or her newborn experiences pregnancy com-
19
plications that result in health problems after birth, 
20
their insurer may end up paying much higher costs 
21
than if the insurer had covered the woman’s mater-
22
nity care during her pregnancy. Intensive maternity 
23
care can reduce hospital and neonatal intensive care 
24
unit admissions among infants, resulting in cost sav-
25

H3126

•HR 3126 IH
ings of $1,768 to $5,560 per birth. For women with 
1
high-risk pregnancies, intensive maternity care saves 
2
$1.37 for every $1 invested in maternity care. 
3
(b) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act is to protect 
4
the health of women and newborns by ensuring that all 
5
women eligible for coverage through the Exchanges estab-
6
lished under title I of the Patient Protection and Afford-
7
able Care Act (Public Law 111–148) and women eligible 
8
for other individual or group health plan coverage can ac-
9
cess affordable health coverage during their pregnancy.
