RESOLUTION 
Urging the International Olympic Committee to take into 
consideration the mass detention of Uyghurs and con-
sider all options to uphold the fundamental rights of 
persecuted minorities in China ahead of the 2022 Olym-
pic Games. 
Whereas more than 1,000,000 ethnic Uyghurs have been de-
tained in a continuing campaign of mass arbitrary deten-
tion in camps in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Re-
gion of the People’s Republic of China on the basis of 
their ethnicity, culture, and religion, raising the spectre 
of crimes against humanity and genocide;

Whereas authorities of the Government of China have report-
edly imposed widespread forced sterilization, abortions, 
and birth control against Uyghur women, potentially rep-
resenting a systematic campaign to prevent births within 
a specific ethnic group; 
Whereas there remain over 300 mass detention facilities in 
the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, including 
forced labor camps, ‘‘re-education’’ or indoctrination 
camps, prisons, and other detention facilities, where 
Uyghurs and other Muslim or Turkic minorities are arbi-
trarily detained, over 60 of which have shown signs of ex-
pansion in the past year; 
Whereas a recent Chinese Communist Party white paper 
claims that between 2014 and 2019, over 1,000,000 
Uyghurs a year received ‘‘vocational training’’, a euphe-
mism understood to indicate political and linguistic indoc-
trination accompanied by requirements that detainees re-
nounce their Uyghur religious and ethnic identity; 
Whereas there have been multiple credible reports that de-
tained Uyghurs are subjected to torture and sexual 
abuse, as well as forced labor at factories producing 
goods for export inside and outside the detention facili-
ties; 
Whereas, in October 2020, 39 countries at the United Na-
tions Third Committee of the General Assembly appealed 
for action on the mass arbitrary detentions and other 
crimes against the Uyghur Muslim population of the 
Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region; 
Whereas the 2018 concluding observations of the United Na-
tions Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimina-

tion decried reports of mass arbitrary detention of 
Uyghurs; 
Whereas over 400 international nongovernmental organiza-
tions have joined together to decry the mass arbitrary de-
tentions of Uyghurs in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous 
Region; 
Whereas the Olympic Charter states that the practice of 
sport ‘‘is a human right’’ that ‘‘shall be secured without 
discrimination of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, sex-
ual orientation, language, religion, political or other opin-
ion, national or social origin, property, birth or other sta-
tus’’—a right that by definition cannot be secured in a 
country in which over 1,000,000 people are imprisoned in 
camps because of their race, language, and religion; 
Whereas the 2008 Olympics in Beijing were accompanied by 
widespread tracking, arrest, and intimidation of foreign 
journalists and bloggers, as well as restrictions on move-
ment of journalists, contrary to explicit commitments 
made by the Government of the People’s Republic of 
China to the International Olympic Committee; 
Whereas the Government of China denied visas for some 
journalists granted press accreditation for the 2008 
Olympic Games, and the Beijing Organising Committee 
of the Olympic Games repeatedly refused to address inci-
dents involving freedom of expression; and 
Whereas the International Olympic Committee faced broad 
criticism for failing to adequately anticipate infringe-
ments by the Government of the People’s Republic of 
China’s on freedom of expression and press for inter-
national media and 2008 Olympics participants, and fail-
ing to hold the Government of the People’s Republic of

China to their own commitments to safeguard human 
rights during the 2008 games: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives urges 
1
the International Olympic Committee to— 
2
(1) consider that the Olympic Charter’s prin-
3
ciples of solidarity and nondiscrimination are hard to 
4
reconcile with holding the 2022 Winter Games in a 
5
country the government of which stands credibly ac-
6
cused of perpetrating crimes against humanity and 
7
genocide against ethnic and religious minorities; 
8
(2) take into account the recent precedent of 
9
the 2008 games, at which Olympic athletes, spec-
10
tators, and international media had their funda-
11
mental freedoms severely challenged, and the likely 
12
limitations the Government of China will seek to en-
13
force on participants speaking out about ongoing 
14
persecution of the Uyghurs and other human rights 
15
abuses in China, despite repeated commitments by 
16
the Government of China; 
17
(3) emphasize that the International Olympic 
18
Committee is not opposed to moving an Olympic 
19
competition in all circumstances, and will keep this 
20
option available as demanded by the human rights 
21
situation, and initiate an emergency search process 
22
for suitable replacement facilities for the 2022 Win-
23

lease all arbitrarily held Uyghurs from mass deten-

tion centers and prisons; 
2
(4) affirm the International Olympic Commit-
3
tee’s— 
4
(A) desire to stay above politics does not 
5
permit turning a blind eye to mass atrocity 
6
crimes, which cannot and should not be dis-
7
missed as mere political concerns; and 
8
(B) commitment to the fundamental rights 
9
instruments of the international system, which 
10
are beyond partisan or domestic policy, and 
11
upon which the success of the entire Olympic 
12
project depends; and 
13
(5) propose a set of clear, executable actions to 
14
be taken by the International Olympic Committee 
15
upon infringement of freedom of expression by a 
16
host country’s government during any Olympics

event, including the 2022 Winter Olympics, against

athletes, participants, and international media.
