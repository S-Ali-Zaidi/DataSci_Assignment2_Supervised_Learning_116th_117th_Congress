SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds as follows:

(1) The Americans with Disabilities Act, section

•HR 1235 IH
Act (ACA) prohibit discrimination against individ-
1
uals with disabilities in organ transplantation and 
2
the rationing of organs. 
3
(2) Despite these protections, there are findings 
4
and cases that show that individuals with disabilities 
5
are being denied organ transplants and related serv-
6
ices solely based on the fact that they have a dis-
7
ability, as is documented by the National Council on 
8
Disability and others. 
9
(3) Sixteen States have crafted state level policy 
10
to prohibit organ transplant discrimination against 
11
individuals with disabilities, however, Federal action 
12
is required to protect Americans with disabilities and 
13
to enforce existing law regardless of the state in 
14
which they live. 
15
(4) Continuing cases of discrimination against 
16
individuals with disabilities calls for further clarity 
17
by Congress to which actions constitute discrimina-
18
tion within the existing legal context, which entities 
19
are covered, and the remedies available to individ-
20
uals experiencing potential discrimination. 
21
(5) Licensed providers of health care services 
22
who perform organ transplants and related services 
23
in exchange for medical fees are engaging in an eco-

nomic transaction with patients that occurs in or 
1
substantially impacts interstate commerce. 
2
(6) There are 11 geographic regions that are 
3
used for U.S. organ allocation with organs being 
4
transported across state lines for transplantation 
5
procedures. 
6
(7) Discrimination in organ transplantation 
7
limits individuals with disabilities from participating 
8
in a manner that allows equal access to interstate 
9
commerce. 
10
(8) The existence of arbitrary discrimination 
11
against individuals with disabilities in organ trans-
12
plantation and related services burdens the flow of 
13
organs through legal channels of interstate com-
14
merce. 
15
(9) Congress is empowered to regulate and pro-
16
tect the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, 
17
persons, or things in interstate commerce, even 
18
though the threat may come only from intrastate ac-
19
tivities. 
20
(10) Congress’ commerce authority includes the 
21
power to regulate those activities having substantial 
22
relation to interstate commerce and activities that 
23
substantially affect interstate commerce.
