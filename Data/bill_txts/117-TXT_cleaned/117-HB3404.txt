SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) As expressed in the Water Supply Act of 
3
1958, Congress has recognized the primary respon-
4
sibilities of the States and local interests in devel-
5
oping water supplies for domestic, municipal, indus-
6
trial, and other purposes, and that the Federal Gov-
7
ernment should participate and cooperate in these 
8
projects. 
9
(2) There is a long and robust legal precedent 
10
of Federal deference to State primacy in water law 
11
and the legal system that States establish for resolv-
12
ing disputes over water use, with the Supreme Court 
13
finding in Kansas v. Colorado that ‘‘Congress cannot 
14
enforce either rule upon any State’’ in matters of 
15
the right regulation of water rights. 
16
(3) The entire American West and Southwest 
17
are facing forecasts of prolonged droughts that will 
18
leave States facing major water shortages and cata-
19
strophic wildfires. 
20
(4) Recent periods of drought in the American 
21
West have also occurred with higher temperatures 
22
and reduced snowpack and led to what climate sci-
23
entists recently concluded was possibly the most se-
24
vere drought in California in over 1,200 years. 
25
05:26 Jun 30, 2021
H3404

•HR 3404 IH
(5) The Colorado River has been under drought 
1
conditions since 2000, and the chances of a 
2
‘‘megadrought’’ striking the Southwest and central 
3
Great Plains are on the rise according to forecasts 
4
from climate scientists. 
5
(6) Addressing water shortages today and in 
6
the future will require action from the Federal Gov-
7
ernment that respects State, local, and Tribal law, 
8
and that the policies that respond to droughts 
9
should not pit State against State, region against re-
10
gion, or stakeholders against one another. 
11
(7) Congress recognizes the range of separate, 
12
distinct Federal agencies with authorities and re-
13
sources that play a role in water supply, including 
14
treatment and remediation of groundwater, surface 
15
water storage, water recycling and reuse, and other 
16
clean water infrastructure, and to avoid duplication 
17
and ensure the efficiency and effectiveness of these 
18
various Federal roles, there is a need for improved 
19
coordination, streamlining, and collaboration, both 
20
among Federal agencies and with drought-impacted 
21
States and localities. 
22
(8) It is the policy of the United States to re-
23
spect California’s coequal goals, established by the 
24
Delta Reform Act of 2009, of providing a more reli-
25
05:26 Jun 30, 2021
H3404

•HR 3404 IH
able water supply for California and protecting, re-
1
storing, and enhancing the Delta ecosystem, and 
2
these coequal goals shall be achieved in a manner 
3
that protects and enhances the unique cultural, rec-
4
reational, natural resource, and agricultural values 
5
of the Delta as an evolving place. 
6
(9) The State of California, in CA Water Code 
7
section 85021, has established a policy to reduce re-
8
liance on the Delta in meeting California’s future 
9
water supply needs through a statewide strategy of 
10
investing in improved regional supplies, conservation, 
11
and water use efficiency; California law directs each 
12
region that depends on water from the Delta water-
13
shed to improve its regional self-reliance for water 
14
through investment in water use efficiency, water re-
15
cycling, advanced water technologies, local and re-
16
gional water supply projects, and improved regional 
17
coordination of local and regional water supply ef-
18
forts; and it is the intent of Congress to ensure that 
19
Federal programs, policies, and investments respect 
20
and compliment, and do not undermine or conflict 
21
with, California’s policy of reducing reliance on 
22
Delta diversions. 
23

24
reau of Reclamation’s Central Valley Project in Cali-

fornia in compliance with all Federal and State laws, 
1
including biological opinions, while working with the 
2
State to maximize operational flexibility in order to 
3
deliver as much water as reasonably possible to 
4
drought-impacted areas and minimize the harm suf-
5
fered by fish and wildlife as a result of drought. 
6
(11) The Reclamation Fund was established in 
7
1902 with the express purpose of providing for the 
8
construction and maintenance of water infrastruc-
9
ture for the economic development of the Western 
10
States and territories, with revenues deposited into 
11
the fund out of public land sales within these West-
12
ern States and territories. 
13
(12) Since 1902, the Reclamation Fund has 
14
been supplemented with additional revenues from 
15
Federal water resources development and mineral 
16
and natural resource leases on Federal lands, such 
17
that the surplus within the Reclamation Fund now 
18
exceeds $17,000,000,000. 
19
(13) The Reclamation Fund represents a trans-
20
fer of a portion of receipts from Federal lands and 
21
Federal natural resources in the West back to the 
22
West for water development, and the Reclamation 
23
Fund’s surplus should be used to assist the West in 
24
meeting its water needs for public health and safety, 
25

•HR 3404 IH
for expanding water recycling, reuse, and reclama-
1
tion, and for meeting the emergency needs of com-
2
munities impacted by drought. 
3
(14) The Federal funding provided in this Act 
4
will support near-term and long-term water supply 
5
reliability for the Western States, including through 
6
the use of the Reclamation Fund surplus to support 
7
long-term water infrastructure investment. 
8
(15) The Federal funding authorized in title I 
9
of this Act can help provide additional water sup-
10
plies to the Western States in the near-term, includ-
11
ing 650,000 acre-feet per year in additional average 
12
yield through water reuse projects, 350,000 acre-feet 
13
per year in additional average yield through water 
14
storage projects, and 100,000 acre-feet per year in 
15
additional average yield through water desalination 
16
projects. 
17
(16) Robust Federal investment and support is 
18
needed to assist the Western States in developing fu-
19
ture drought resiliency in the face of climate change, 
20
which will continue to exacerbate existing water sup-
21
ply challenges in an already arid region of the coun-
22
try.
