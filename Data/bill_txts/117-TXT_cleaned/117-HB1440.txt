OF POLICY.—The Congress hereby finds and declares the 
7
following: 
8
‘‘(1) At-risk children deserve a safe and caring 
9
family, and reducing the number of vulnerable chil-
10
dren without a permanent home is in the Federal in-
11
terest. 
12
‘‘(2) There is a national deficit in the number 
13
of adoptive and foster parents and the private agen-
14
cies qualified to serve these children. Federal and 
15
State governments should cooperate to encourage 
16
new agencies to join the effort to serve the needs of 
17
vulnerable children, alongside private agencies that 
18
have already been doing that crucial work for dec-
19
ades, including agencies whose commitment to serve 
20
arises from profound religious convictions. 
21
‘‘(3) By providing safe and welcoming homes to 
22
vulnerable children, adoptive and foster care parents 
23
serve the best interests of children and contribute to 
24
the common good of our communities in ways that 
25

•HR 1440 IH
are irreplaceable. Such parents should be empowered 
1
to adopt children based on their merits as parents, 
2
without being thwarted by discriminatory obstacles. 
3
‘‘(4) By finding safe and welcoming homes for 
4
vulnerable children, religious and other providers of 
5
adoption and foster care services, facilitate connec-
6
tions between good parents and vulnerable children. 
7
In doing so, such providers also contribute to the 
8
common good of our communities in ways that are 
9
irreplaceable. 
10
‘‘(5) The indirect funding program created by 
11
this section is intended to be a permanent and fully 
12
funded program that links vulnerable children to 
13
good parents in order to serve the best interests of 
14
children. This indirect funding program will do so by 
15
ensuring that diverse adoption and foster-care pro-
16
viders, including religious providers, will continue to 
17

‘‘(6) Therefore, it is the policy of the Federal 
19
Government to protect the best interests of at-risk 
20
children by establishing minimum Federal standards 
21
that guarantee the equal treatment of qualified fam-
22
