A BILL 
To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to tax bona 
fide residents of the District of Columbia in the same 
manner as bona fide residents of possessions of the 
United States. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘No Taxation Without 
4
Representation Act’’.

The Congress finds the following:

•HR 1295 IH
(1) The phrase ‘‘no taxation without represen-
1
tation’’ was a rallying cry of many American colo-
2
nists during the period of British rule in the 1760s 
3
and early 1770s. The slogan gained widespread no-
4
toriety after the passage of the Sugar Act on April 
5
5, 1764. 
6
(2) American colonists increasingly resented 
7
having taxes levied upon them without having any 
8
legislators they elected who were voting in Par-
9
liament in London. The idea that there should be no 
10
taxation without representation dated back even fur-
11
ther. Benjamin Franklin stated, ‘‘it is suppos’d an 
12
undoubted Right of Englishmen not to be taxed but 
13
by their own Consent given thro’ their Representa-
14
tives.’’. 
15
(3) This issue became even more defined in 
16
1765 with the passage of the Stamp Act which was 
17
the first true attempt to levy a direct tax on the 
18
American colonies. Ultimately the tax was repealed, 
19
but the idea of no taxation without representation 
20
persisted. 
21
(4) Article I, section 2, clause 1 of the United 
22
States Constitution, states, ‘‘The House of Rep-
23
resentatives shall be composed of Members chosen 
24
every second Year by the People of the SEVERAL

STATES, and the Electors in each State shall have 
1
the Qualifications requisite for Electors of the most 
2
numerous Branch of the State Legislature.’’. 
3
(5) The Organic Act of 1801 placed Wash-
4
ington, DC, under the exclusive jurisdiction of the 
5
United States Congress and people in the District 
6
were no longer considered residents of Virginia or 
7
Maryland. 
8
(6) Many in Washington, DC, were immediately 
9
opposed to the idea of being taxed without congres-
10
sional representation and over the years several con-
11
gressional leaders introduced constitutional amend-
12
ments to give the District of Columbia voting rep-
13
resentation, though none were successful. 
14
(7) In 1898, Puerto Rico was acquired by the 
15
United States and currently has a Resident Commis-
16
sioner with limited voting rights. Section 933 of the 
17
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 exempts bona fide 
18
citizens who are residents of Puerto Rico for the en-
19
tire taxable year from Federal taxes on income 
20
earned in Puerto Rico. 
21
(8) On March 31, 1917, the United States took 
22
possession of the Virgin Islands and in 1927, the 
23
territory’s residents were granted citizenship. Under 
24
section 932 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,

•HR 1295 IH
individuals who are bona fide residents of the United 
1
States Virgin Islands during the entire taxable year, 
2
and who fully pay all income tax liabilities to the 
3
United States Virgin Islands, are not subject to Fed-
4
eral income taxes on their income. 
5
(9) Guam was established as a territory of the 
6
United States after the passage of the Guam Or-
7
ganic Act of 1950. Under the provisions of section 
8
935 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, residents 
9
of Guam are required to file tax returns with Guam, 
10
but not with the United States Federal Government 
11
and therefore the residents do not have to pay 
12
United States Federal income taxes. 
13
(10) The Commonwealth of the Northern Mar-
14
iana Islands was established in 1975 after residents 
15
decided not to pursue independence, but instead they 
16
opted to enter into territory negotiations. The tax 
17
treatment of the Northern Mariana Islands is simi-
18
lar to the structure of Guam in that bona fide resi-
19
dents are not required to pay Federal income taxes. 
20
(11) American Samoa, which is technically con-
21
sidered ‘‘unorganized’’ because no Organic Acts have 
22
been passed by Congress, is governed by section 931 
23
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Under this 
24
section, bona fide year-round residents are exempt 
25

•HR 1295 IH
from Federal taxes on income they earn in Samoa, 
1
Guam, and Northern Mariana Islands, but are sub-
2
ject to Federal taxes on income earned elsewhere. 
3
(12) In keeping with the early history and 
4
democratic traditions of the United States, the prin-
5
ciples established in the Constitution, and in con-
6
formance with the other territories of the United 
7
States which have delegates but no Representative, 
8
the residents of the District of Columbia should be 
9
exempt from paying United States Federal income 
10
taxes.
