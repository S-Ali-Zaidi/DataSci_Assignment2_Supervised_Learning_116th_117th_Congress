Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Turkey and Ecumeni-

Congress finds the following:

•HR 3056 IH
(1) The promotion and protection of the univer-
1
sally recognized right to the freedom of religion is a 
2
priority of United States foreign policy as stated in 
3
section 402 of the International Religious Freedom 
4
Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6442). 
5
(2) The Ecumenical Patriarchate is the spir-
6
itual home of the world’s oldest and second largest 
7
Christian Church. 
8
(3) Within the 2,000-year-old Sacred See of the 
9
Ecumenical Patriarchate, the New Testament was 
10
codified and the Nicene Creed was created. 
11
(4) Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew is one 
12
of the world’s preeminent spiritual leaders and 
13
peacemakers representing over 300 million Orthodox 
14
Christians worldwide. 
15
(5) The disappearance of the See would mean 
16
the end of a crucial link between the Christian and 
17
the Muslim world since the continuing presence of 
18
the Ecumenical Patriarchate in Turkey is a living 
19
testimony of religious co-existence since 1453. 
20
(6) The Ecumenical Patriarch has direct juris-
21
diction over the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of 
22
America and thus is the spiritual and ecclesiastical 
23
leader of its 1.5 million adherents.

•HR 3056 IH
(7) The Ecumenical Patriarch is, in a sense, 
1
also an American spiritual leader and should be af-
2
forded the protections of an American spiritual lead-
3
er. 
4
(8) Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew was 
5
awarded the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest 
6
award bestowed by the United States Congress, and 
7
he coordinated with religious leaders around the 
8
world to issue a condemnation of the September 11, 
9
2001, attacks on the United States as an anti-reli-
10
gious act. 
11
(9) The Ecumenical Patriarchate has a record 
12
of reaching out and working for peace and reconcili-
13
ation amongst all faiths and has fostered dialogue 
14
among Christians, Jews, and Muslims. 
15
(10) The Ecumenical Patriarchate co-sponsored 
16
the Peace and Tolerance Conference in Istanbul 
17
which issued the Bosphorus Declaration that stated, 
18
‘‘A crime committed in the name of religion is a 
19
crime against religion.’’. 
20
(11) Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew stated 
21
in Brussels in 2004, ‘‘The Ecumenical Patriarchate 
22
is a supranational ecclesiastical institution . . . 
23
which demonstrates religious tolerance as a beautiful 
24
reality. For we bear respect toward all of our hu-

mans, irrespective of their faith. Without any trace 
1
of fanaticism or discrimination on account of dif-
2
ferences of religion, we coexist peacefully and in a 
3
spirit that honors each and every human being.’’. 
4
(12) In 1993, the European Union defined the 
5
membership criteria for accession to the European 
6
Union at the Copenhagen European Council, obli-
7
gating candidate countries to have achieved certain 
8
levels of reform, including stability of institutions 
9
guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, and human 
10
rights, and respect for and protection of minorities. 
11
(13) Turkey’s persecution of religious minori-
12
ties violates the European Union Charter of Funda-
13
mental Rights as well as the United Nations Inter-
14
national Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
15
which Turkey has signed and ratified, and which 
16
guarantees freedom of religion. 
17
(14) The Government of Turkey has failed to 
18
recognize the international legal personality of the 
19
Ecumenical Patriarchate. 
20
(15) The Government of Turkey and the gov-
21
ernments of all nations should accord to the Ecu-
22
menical Patriarchate the diplomatic rights and im-
23
munities under the Vienna Convention.

(16) The Government of Turkey has and con-
1
tinues to violate the rights and privileges of the Ecu-
2
menical Patriarchate under the Treaty of Lausanne 
3
of 1923 and prior treaties. 
4
(17) The Government of Turkey has limited 
5
candidates available to the Holy Synod of the Ecu-
6
menical Patriarchate to Turkish nationals and 
7
reneged on its agreement to reopen the Theological 
8
School at Halki, thus impeding the training for Or-
9
thodox clergy. 
10
(18) The Government of Turkey has confiscated 
11
75 percent of Ecumenical Patriarchate properties 
12
and has placed a 42-percent retroactive tax on the 
13
Balukli Hospital of Istanbul which is operated by 
14
the Ecumenical Patriarchate. 
15
(19) Turkey has systematically converted or de-
16
stroyed minority religious symbols and property, in-
17
cluding converting the Hagia Sophia and Church of 
18
the Holy Saviour in Chora, UNESCO-designated 
19
museums located in Istanbul, into mosques, in viola-
20
tion of the UNESCO convention. 
21
(20) The European Council has agreed to open 
22
accession negotiations with Turkey, conditional upon 
23
the continuation by Turkey of reform processes to

increase protection and support for human rights

and civil liberties. 
2
(21) Although the Constitution of Turkey os-
3
tensibly provides for freedom of religion, the United 
4
States Commission on International Religious Free-
5
dom’s 2021 Annual Report on International Reli-
6
gious Freedom maintains that, ‘‘In 2020, religious 
7
freedom conditions in Turkey continued to follow a 
8
troubling trajectory. In July, Turkish President 
9
Recep Tayyip Erdogan issued a decree converting 
10
back into a mosque the famous Hagia Sophia, a 
11
former church that had been serving as a museum, 
12
in a move that many denounced as divisive and hos-
13
tile to Turkey’s religious minorities. . . The govern-
14
ment furthermore made little to no effort to address 
15
many longstanding religious freedom issues and it 
16
ignored the continued targeting and vandalization of 
17
religious minority properties throughout the country. 
18
Despite repeated requests by religious minority com-
19
munities for permission to hold board member elec-
20
tions for non-Muslim foundations, the government 
21
did not permit those elections during the year. Simi-
22
larly, the government disregarded calls for the re-
23
opening of the Greek Orthodox Halki Seminary and 
24
continued to deny legal personality to all religious

communities. . . In December, Turkey’s parliament 
1
passed a law that human rights groups warned 
2
would increase governmental control over civil soci-
3
ety, including religious groups, by subjecting them to 
4
intensified oversight and new limitations on online 
5
fundraising. . . Many religious minorities continued 
6
to feel threatened in connection with incidents per-
7
petrated by nonstate actors or due to direct pressure 
8
from the state. . . Throughout the year, authorities 
9
brought politically motivated charges of blasphemy 
10
against individuals and groups, while others in offi-
11
cial positions utilized rhetoric characterized as hate 
12
speech that denigrated nonreligious individuals and 
13
members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, 
14
and intersex (LGBTI) community. Religious sites— 
15
including places of worship and cemeteries—were 
16
subject to vandalism, damage, and, in some cases, 
17
destruction, which the government regularly fails to 
18
prevent or punish.’’. 
19
(22) Accordingly, in its 2021 Annual Report on 
20
International Religious Freedom, the United States 
21
Commission on International Religious Freedom rec-
22
ommended that the Department of State ‘‘[i]nclude 
23

It is the sense of Congress that— 
5
(1) the designation of Turkey as a country on 
6
the ‘‘Special Watch List’’ for severe violations of re-
7
ligious freedom pursuant to section 402(b)(1)(A)(iii) 
8
of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 
9
(22 U.S.C. 6442(b)(1)(A)(iii)) would be a powerful 
10
and effective tool in— 
11
(A) highlighting abuses of religious free-
12
dom in Turkey and against the Ecumenical Pa-
13
triarchate; and 
14
(B) in encouraging improvement with the 
15
respect to religious freedoms and the rights of 
16
the Ecumenical Patriarchate in Turkey; and 
17
(2) the President should, in accordance with the 
18
recommendation of the United States Commission 
19
on International Religious Freedom, designate Tur-
20
key as a country on such ‘‘Special Watch List’’.
