SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON FUNDING THE LOAN-LOSS

RESERVE FUND FOR SMALL DOLLAR LOANS.

The sense of Congress is the following: 
3
(1) The Community Development Financial In-
4
stitutions Fund (the ‘‘CDFI Fund’’) is an agency of 
5
the Department of the Treasury, and was estab-
6
lished by the Riegle Community Development and 
7
Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994. The mission 
8
of the CDFI Fund is ‘‘to expand economic oppor-
9
tunity for underserved people and communities by 
10
supporting the growth and capacity of a national 
11
network of community development lenders, inves-
12
tors, and financial service providers’’. A community 
13
development financial institution (a ‘‘CDFI’’) is a 
14
specialized financial institution serving low-income 
15
communities and a Community Development Entity 
16
(a ‘‘CDE’’) is a domestic corporation or partnership 
17

that is an intermediary vehicle for the provision of 
1
loans, investments, or financial counseling in low-in-
2
come communities. The CDFI Fund certifies CDFIs 
3
and CDEs. Becoming a certified CDFI or CDE al-
4
lows organizations to participate in various CDFI 
5
Fund programs as follows: 
6
(A) The Bank Enterprise Award Program, 
7
which provides FDIC-insured depository institu-
8
tions awards for a demonstrated increase in 
9
lending and investments in distressed commu-
10
nities and CDFIs. 
11
(B) The CDFI Program, which provides 
12
Financial and Technical Assistance awards to 
13
CDFIs to reinvest in the CDFI, and to build 
14
the capacity of the CDFI, including financing 
15
product development and loan loss reserves. 
16
(C) The Native American CDFI Assistance 
17
Program, which provides CDFIs and spon-
18
soring entities Financial and Technical Assist-
19
ance awards to increase lending and grow the 
20
number of CDFIs owned by Native Americans 
21
to help build capacity of such CDFIs. 
22
(D) The New Market Tax Credit Program, 
23
which provides tax credits for making equity in-

vestments in CDEs that stimulate capital in-
1
vestments in low-income communities. 
2
(E) The Capital Magnet Fund, which pro-
3
vides awards to CDFIs and nonprofit affordable 
4
housing organizations to finance affordable 
5
housing solutions and related economic develop-
6
ment activities. 
7
(F) The Bond Guarantee Program, a 
8
source of long-term, patient capital for CDFIs 
9
to expand lending and investment capacity for 
10
community and economic development purposes. 
11
(2) The Department of the Treasury is author-
12
ized to create multi-year grant programs designed to 
13
encourage low-to-moderate income individuals to es-
14
tablish accounts at federally insured banks, and to 
15
improve low-to-moderate income individuals’ access 
16
to such accounts on reasonable terms. 
17
(3) Under this authority, grants to participants 
18
in CDFI Fund programs may be used for loan-loss 
19
reserves and to establish small-dollar loan programs 
20
by subsidizing related losses. These grants also allow 
21
for the providing recipients with the financial coun-
22
seling and education necessary to conduct trans-
23
actions and manage their accounts. These loans pro-
24
vide low-cost alternatives to payday loans and other 
25

•HR 6745 IH
nontraditional forms of financing that often impose 
1
excessive interest rates and fees on borrowers, and 
2
lead millions of Americans to fall into debt traps. 
3
Small-dollar loans can only be made pursuant to 
4
terms, conditions, and practices that are reasonable 
5
for the individual consumer obtaining the loan. 
6
(4) Program participation is restricted to eligi-
7
ble institutions, which are limited to organizations 
8
listed in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue 
9
Code and exempt from tax under 501(a) of such 
10
Code, federally insured depository institutions, com-
11
munity development financial institutions and State, 
12
local, or Tribal government entities. 
13
(5) According to the CDFI Fund, some pro-
14
grams attract as much as $10 in private capital for 
15
every $1 invested by the CDFI Fund. The Adminis-
16
tration and the Congress should prioritize appropria-
17
tion of funds for the loan loss reserve fund and tech-
18
nical assistance programs administered by the Com-
19
munity Development Financial Institution Fund.
