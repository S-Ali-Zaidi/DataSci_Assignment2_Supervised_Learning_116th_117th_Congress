HJ29
2 
•HJ 29 IH 
(1) In response to unconstitutional executive 
1
branch actions that introduced United States Forces 
2
into hostilities without congressional authorization, 
3
Congress passed the War Powers Resolution (50 
4
U.S.C. 1541 et seq.) to clarify and strengthen its 
5
constitutional war powers authorities. 
6
(2) The War Powers Resolution remains a cur-
7
rent and constitutionally valid law. The War Powers 
8
Resolution includes the authority of Congress to re-
9
move United States Armed Forces from unauthor-
10
ized engagement in hostilities through adoption of a 
11
concurrent resolution or passage of a joint resolu-
12
tion. 
13
(3) While Congress possesses robust war powers 
14
authorities under the Constitution and the War 
15
Powers Resolution, in many cases the executive 
16
branch has disregarded these authorities by intro-
17
ducing United States Forces into hostilities without 
18
congressional authorization. 
19
(b) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this joint resolution 
20
is to— 
21
(1) reassert Congress’ constitutional war pow-
22
ers authorities, further strengthen the War Powers 
23
Resolution, and end the current ‘‘forever wars’’ of 
24
the United States; and 
25
01:02 Mar 10, 2021
HJ29

•HJ 29 IH 
(2) prevent the executive branch from intro-
1
ducing United States Forces into hostilities, with ex-
2
ceptions in the case of an armed attack upon or im-
3
minent threat to the United States, its Forces, or its 
4
citizens overseas, without authorization from Con-
5
gress.
