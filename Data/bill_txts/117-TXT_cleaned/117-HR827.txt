Recognizing the contributions made by the 305-meter radio 
telescope at the Arecibo Observatory. 
Whereas the Department of Defense began developing the 
Arecibo Observatory located in Barrio Esperanza, Are-
cibo, Puerto Rico, during the 1950s, and its char-
acteristic instrument, a large radio telescope of 305 me-
ters in diameter was completed in 1963; 
Whereas the facility was later owned by the National Science 
Foundation, and supported by the National Aeronautics 
and Space Administration and various university part-
ners; 
Whereas the Arecibo Observatory’s 305-meter fixed spherical 
radio telescope, was the world’s largest single-dish radio

telescope until the Five-Hundred-Meter Aperture Spher-
ical Radio Telescope located in Gizhou, China, began ob-
serving in 2016; 
Whereas the 305-meter radio telescope made unparalleled 
contributions to the fields of radio astronomy, planetary, 
and atmospheric sciences, and played a role in inspiring 
thousands of students in Puerto Rico, the Nation, and 
the world to pursue careers in STEM fields through the 
Arecibo Observatory Education and Public Outreach Pro-
grams; 
Whereas the radio telescope significantly advanced the field 
of radio astronomy, including the first indirect detection 
of gravitational waves, the first detection of extrasolar 
planets, innumerable contributions to the field of time do-
main astronomy and the study of the interstellar me-
dium, and played a key role in the search for extra-
terrestrial intelligence; 
Whereas the Arecibo Observatory had the best planetary 
radar system in the world, used by the National Aero-
nautics and Space Administration for near-Earth object 
detection and was an essential part of the agency’s plan-
etary defense program; 
Whereas the planetary radar at the Arecibo Observatory has 
contributed fundamentally and significantly to the knowl-
edge of the solar system; 
Whereas the Arecibo Observatory’s Incoherent Scatter Radar 
and supporting facilities have provided fundamental un-
derstanding of the ionosphere and upper atmosphere, and 
the interface between the atmosphere and space that pro-
tects the planet from solar wind, meteors, and other po-
tential threats; and

Whereas December 1, 2021, marks the 1-year anniversary of 
the uncontrolled collapse sustained by the radio telescope 
after a series of cable failures in tower 4: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) acknowledges the loss of the Arecibo Ob-
2
servatory’s radio telescope due to its collapse and its 
3
implications for the loss of a unique world-class mul-
4
tidisciplinary science facility which conducted re-
5
search in the areas of space and atmospheric 
6
sciences, radar astronomy and planetary sciences, 
7
astronomy, and astrophysics; 
8
(2) acknowledges that the uncontrolled collapse 
9
of the 305-meter radio telescope represents a re-
10
markable loss of astronomical observation capabili-
11
ties, scientific research and development, planetary 
12
defense capabilities, and applied science advantage 
13
for the United States; 
14
(3) recognizes the rich scientific, educational, 
15
and economic benefits that the Arecibo Telescope 
16
has made to the people of Puerto Rico, the Nation, 
17
and the world; 
18
(4) recognizes the work and contributions made 
19
by the thousands of dedicated staff who have sup-
20
ported the Arecibo Observatory for close to 6 dec-
21
ades;

(5) commends the National Science Foundation 
1
for convening a virtual workshop in June 2021, to 
2
explore ideas for future scientific and educational ac-
3
tivities at the Arecibo Observatory; and 
4
(6) encourages the National Science Founda-
