A BILL 
To amend chapter 44 of title 18, United States Code, to 
prohibit the distribution of 3D printer plans for the 
printing of firearms, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘3D Printed Gun Safety 
2
Act of 2021’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) Three dimensional, or ‘‘3D’’ printing, in-
6
volves the programming of a 3D printing machine 
7
with a computer file that provides the schematics for 
8
the item to be printed. 
9
(2) Recent technological developments have al-
10
lowed for the 3D printing of firearms and firearm 
11
parts, including parts made out of plastic, by unli-
12
censed individuals in possession of relatively inexpen-
13
sive 3D printers. 
14
(3) Because 3D printing allows individuals to 
15
make their own firearms out of plastic, they may be 
16
able to evade detection by metal detectors at security 
17
checkpoints, increasing the risk that a firearm will 
18
be used to perpetrate violence on an airplane or 
19
other area where people congregate. 
20
(4) The availability of online schematics for the 
21
3D printing of firearms and firearm parts increases 
22
the risk that dangerous people, including felons, do-
23
mestic abusers, and other people prohibited from 
24
possessing firearms under Federal law, will obtain a 
25
firearm through 3D printing.

(5) On June 7, 2013, an assailant used a gun 
1
he had constructed by himself to kill his father, 
2
brother, and 3 other people at Santa Monica College 
3
in California. The person had failed a background 
4
check when he tried to purchase a gun from a li-
5
censed gun dealer. The gun he used was made from 
6
an unfinished AR–15-style receiver, similar to a re-
7
ceiver that can now be made with a 3D printer. 
8
(6) Firearms tracing is a powerful investigative 
9
tool. When law enforcement agencies recover fire-
10
arms that have been used in crimes, the agencies 
11
work with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Fire-
12
arms, and Explosives to trace these firearms to their 
13
first retail purchaser. The agencies can use that in-
14
formation to investigate and solve the crimes. In 
15
2019 alone, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Fire-
16
arms, and Explosives traced and recovered 269,250 
17
firearms. 
18
(7) Firearms tracing depends on the ability to 
19
identify firearms based on their serial number. Tra-
20
ditionally, when a firearm is manufactured domesti-
21
cally or imported from abroad, it is engraved with 
22
a serial number and markings that identify the man-
23
ufacturer or importer, make, model, and caliber, and 
24
are unique to the firearm. Firearms made by unli-

censed individuals with 3D printers, however, do not 
1
contain genuine serial numbers. 
2
(8) Criminals seek firearms without serial num-
3
bers because they cannot be traced. In July 2018, 
4
the Los Angeles Police Department completed a 6- 
5
month-long investigation that resulted in the seizure 
6
of 45 firearms, some of which had been assembled 
7
without serial numbers in order to be untraceable. If 
8
the schematics for 3D printing firearms and firearm 
9
parts are available online, people intending to com-
10
mit gun crimes may create similarly untraceable 
11
firearms in order to avoid accountability for these 
12
crimes. 
13
(9) Interstate gun trafficking, including the 
14
trafficking of untraceable firearms, interferes with 
15
lawful commerce in firearms and significantly con-
16
tributes to gun crime. Of the 269,250 firearms 
17
traced by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, 
18
and Explosives in 2019, 75,513 of those firearms 
19
were originally sold by a licensed firearms dealer in 
20
a State other than the State where they were recov-
21
ered. These guns made up 28.0 percent of all fire-
22
arm recoveries in 2019. 
23
(10) The proliferation of 3D printed firearms 
24
threatens to undermine the entire Federal firearms

regulatory scheme and to endanger public safety and 
1
national security. By making illegal the distribution 
2
of certain computer code that can be used automati-
3
cally to program 3D printers and create firearms— 
4
the only means of combating this unique threat— 
5
Congress seeks not to regulate the rights of com-
6
puter programmers under the First Amendment to 
7
the Constitution of the United States, but rather to 
8
curb the pernicious effects of untraceable—and po-
9
tentially undetectable—firearms. 
10
SEC. 3. PROHIBITION. 
11
Section 922 of title 18, United States Code, is 
12
amended by adding at the end the following: 
13
‘‘(aa) It shall be unlawful for any person to inten-
14
tionally distribute, over the Internet or by means of the 
15
World Wide Web, digital instructions in the form of Com-
16
puter Aided Design files or other code that can automati-
17
cally program a 3-dimensional printer or similar device to 
18
produce a firearm or complete a firearm from an unfin-
19
ished frame or receiver.’’.
