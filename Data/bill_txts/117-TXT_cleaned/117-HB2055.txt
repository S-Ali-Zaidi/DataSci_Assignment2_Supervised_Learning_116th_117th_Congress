Executive Office of the President, and rendered in accord-
10
ance with sections 511–513 of title 28, United States

13
authorizes the commencement of that civil action.

11
the subpoena or order involved is presumptively priv-
12
ileged based upon the President’s generalized inter-
13
est in confidentiality, the House may overcome this 
14
presumption by showing that— 
15
(A) the House, or a committee or sub-
16
committee thereof, has a specific need for the 
17
information or material in order to carry out its 
18
constitutional obligations; and

expedited to assure to the extent possible that the matter

is fully resolved during the Congress in which the action 
10
was commenced.
