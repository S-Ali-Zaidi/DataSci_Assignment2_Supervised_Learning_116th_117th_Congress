SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Cultivating Oppor-
2
tunity and Recovery from the Pandemic through Service 
3
Act’’ or the ‘‘CORPS Act’’. 
4
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
5
Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) The United States has a strong history of 
7
citizen response to national calls to service in order 
8
to help the Nation recover in times of crisis. 
9
(2) More than 80 years ago, the Nation rose to 
10
the challenge of the Great Depression with the cre-
11
ation of citizen service programs. 
12
(3) Millions of participants benefitted from paid 
13
employment and opportunities to develop their skills 
14
while constructing national parks and public lands 
15
infrastructure and producing cultural works still en-
16
joyed today. 
17
(4) Founded in 1990, the Corporation for Na-
18
tional and Community Service today coordinates na-
19
tional service by individuals in the United States 
20
across every State and territory, partnering with 
21
State-level commissions and supporting locally driv-
22
en services in partnership with nongovernmental or-
23
ganizations and State governments. 
24
(5) National service programs provide public 
25
health, education, employment training, and nutri-

tion services for which the Nation has a critical need 
1
in the current crisis. 
2
(6) The signature programs of the Corporation 
3
for National and Community Service, which are the 
4
AmeriCorps State and National, AmeriCorps Na-
5
tional Civilian Community Corps, AmeriCorps Vol-
6
unteers in Service to America (referred to in this 
7
Act as ‘‘VISTA’’), and National Senior Service 
8
Corps programs, can and should be expanded to 
9
meet current needs. 
10
(7) The novel coronavirus pandemic has in-
11
fected and killed individuals in every State and terri-
12
tory, causing more than 31,000,000 cases and 
13
560,000 deaths so far. 
14
(8) In response, States, Tribal governments, 
15
and cities across the country have closed down busi-
16
nesses, schools, and public events, leading to dra-
17
matic swings in the economy. 
18
(9) Millions of people in the United States have 
19
filed for unemployment benefits since the start of 
20
the pandemic, with unemployment rates peaking at 
21
an unprecedented level. 
22
(10) More than 1 in every 10 adults in the 
23
United States has applied for unemployment insur-
24
ance since the crisis began.

•HR 4100 IH
(11) The pandemic and the associated economic 
1
consequences have disproportionately impacted peo-
2
ple of color across many States. 
3
(12) To recover, the Nation needs meaningful 
4
employment opportunities, as well as a significant 
5
expansion of the human capital working to address 
6
community needs around public health, behavioral 
7
health, hunger, education, and conservation. 
8
(13) Experience has demonstrated the cen-
9
trality of community participation in pandemic re-
10
sponse, to overcome stigma and structural barriers 
11
and meet the full needs of all members of a diverse 
12
community. 
13
(14) As the Nation works to respond to and re-
14
cover from the current twin challenges of a public 
15
health pandemic and an economic crisis, national 
16
service presents a unique opportunity for flexible, lo-
17
cally driven responses to meet State and local em-
18
ployment and recovery needs. 
19
SEC. 3. PURPOSES. 
20
The purposes of this Act are— 
21
(1) to provide for annual growth in the number 
22
of participants, over 3 years, in national service pro-
23

24
pandemic and economic crisis;

(2) to ensure that participant allowances cover 
1
the reasonable cost of participation and provide par-
2
ticipants with economic and educational opportunity; 
3
(3) to stabilize such national service programs 
4
during economic crisis, including by supporting ad-
5
aptations to service models in light of the crisis; and 
6
(4) to support opportunities for all individuals

in the United States to engage in service, including
