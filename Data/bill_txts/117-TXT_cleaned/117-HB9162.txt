SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
The Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The number of annual drug overdose deaths 
3
in the United States has quintupled since 1999. 
4
(2) According to the Centers for Disease Con-
5
trol and Prevention, deaths involving illicit fentanyl 
6
are on the rise, and the number of overdose deaths 
7
involving synthetic opioids in 2020 was more than 
8
18 times the number in 2013. 
9
(3) The Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
10
vention states that in 2020 more than 56,000 people 
11
died from overdoses involving synthetic opioids 
12
(other than methadone) in the United States, ac-
13
counting for over 82 percent of all opioid-involved 
14
deaths. 
15
(4) According to the National Center for Health 
16
Statistics, the age-adjusted rate of drug overdose 
17
deaths involving synthetic opioids other than metha-
18
done (such as fentanyl) increased 56 percent, from 
19
11.4 in 2019 to 17.8 in 2020 per 100,000 standard 
20
population. 
21
(5) The Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
22
vention finds that reports on increases in synthetic 
23
opioid-involved deaths ‘‘are being driven by increases 
24
in fentanyl-involved overdose deaths, and the source

of the fentanyl is more likely to be illicitly manufac-
1
tured than pharmaceutical’’. 
2
(6) In August 2021, the U.S.-China Economic 
3
and Security Review Commission published an issue 
4
brief noting that, in response to China’s May 2019 
5
fentanyl scheduling announcements, ‘‘Chinese illegal 
6
fentanyl producers began seeking new ways to evade 
7
authorities, including developing new fentanyl pre-
8
cursors, working with traffickers in other countries, 
9
and using technology to avoid detection’’. 
10
(7) According to the Drug Enforcement Agen-
11
cy, fentanyl is being mixed with other illicit drugs to 
12
increase the potency of the drug, sold as powders 
13
and nasal spray, and increasingly pressed into pills 
14
made to look like legitimate prescription opioids. 
15
(8) In an August 2022 op-ed, Dr. Rahul Gupta, 
16
Director of the Office of National Drug Control Pol-
17
icy, wrote, ‘‘While clandestinely produced drugs such 
18
as fentanyl hardly ever leave China in their final 
19
form, precursor chemicals for these drugs often are 
20
imported by criminals from China to Mexico, where 
21
lethal synthetic drugs are produced and trafficked to 
22
countries across the globe, including the U.S.’’. 
23
(9) In fiscal year 2022, U.S. Customs and Bor-
24
der Protection seized 12,900 pounds of illicit

fentanyl, which was primarily manufactured in for-
1
eign laboratories and smuggled into the United 
2
States through Mexico—a sufficient quantity to kill 
3
over 2.9 billion people. 
4
(10) Current policies to counter the continued 
5
proliferation of illicit fentanyl have been shown to be 
6
inadequate at protecting the Nation’s communities.
