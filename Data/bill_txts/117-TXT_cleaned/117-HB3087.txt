A BILL 
To amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide 
coverage for custom fabricated breast prostheses fol-
lowing a mastectomy. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS. 
3
(a) SHORT TITLE.—This Act may be cited as the 
4
‘‘Breast Cancer Patient Equity Act’’. 
5
(b) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) There are currently more than 3,800,000 
7
women with a history of breast cancer in the United

States, many of whom experience unreconstructed 
1
breast loss. 
2
(2) In 2021, an estimated 281,550 women will 
3
be diagnosed with invasive breast cancer that re-
4
quired surgery, with many having to undergo sur-
5
gical breast removal. 
6
(3) In 2021, an estimated 43,600 women in the 
7
United States are expected to die from breast can-
8
cer. 
9
(4) Annually, there are 144,000 women in the 
10
United States who undergo mastectomies, a surgical 
11
removal of the breast. 
12
(5) The number of breast mastectomies in the 
13
United States has increased among younger women, 
14
ages 18 to 34 years old, at a rate of 30 percent and 
15
at a rate of 15 percent for women ages 35 to 44 
16
years old. 
17
(6) The results of breast reconstruction surgery 
18
can vary and, as with any surgical procedure, there 
19
are inherent risks associated with such surgery. Ad-
20
ditionally, reconstruction of the breast using im-
21
plants requires lifelong follow up to ensure the 
22
health of the patient. 
23
(7) While the number of women choosing to un-
24
dergo surgical breast reconstruction continues to in-
25

crease, many women continue to lack the viable op-
1
tion of custom fabricated prosthetic breasts to re-
2
store the lost breast. 
3
(8) Both older women and minority women are 
4
less likely to be offered or undergo surgical breast 
5
reconstruction and are disproportionately disadvan-
6
taged by a lack of access to the option of custom 
7
fabricated prosthetic breasts. 
8
(9) Currently, the Medicare program provides 
9
coverage and reimbursement for custom fabricated 
10
prostheses for any body part, with the exception of 
11
breasts, that has been lost. 
12
(10) Following passage of the Women’s Health 
13
and Cancer Rights Act of 1998 (Public Law 105– 
14
277; 42 U.S.C. 201 note), many private insurers 
15
and group health plans began to provide coverage 
16
for custom fabricated breast prostheses as an alter-
17
native to surgical breast reconstruction. 
18
(11) While the Medicare program recognizes 
19
custom fabricated breast prostheses as a discrete de-
20
vice and valid treatment option, having assigned a 
21
billing code for such option under the Healthcare 
22
Common Procedure Coding System (‘‘HCPCS’’) and 
23
setting a maximum allowable fee, Medicare does not 
24
provide reimbursement and denies claims as ‘not

medically necessary’. Medicare does provide reim-
1
bursement, however, for more costly surgical breast 
2
reconstruction. 
3
(12) Due to the fact that the Medicare program 
4
does not provide reimbursement for custom fab-
5
ricated breast prostheses, many private insurance 
6
companies have also begun to limit their reimburse-
7
ment for them. 
8
(13) The Department of Veterans Affairs does 
9
provide the option of a custom fabricated prosthetic 
10
breast for women post-mastectomy. 
11
(14) Providing coverage for custom fabricated 
12
prosthetic breast devices and components will not in-
13
crease the incidence of breast mastectomies.
