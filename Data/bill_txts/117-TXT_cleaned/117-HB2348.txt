A BILL 
To maximize land management efficiencies, promote land 
conservation, generate education funding, and for other 
purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds that— 
7
(1) at statehood, Congress granted each of the 
8
western States land to be held in trust by the States

•HR 2348 IH
and used for the support of public schools and other 
1
public institutions; 
2
(2) since the statehood land grants, Congress 
3
and the executive branch have created multiple Fed-
4
eral conservation areas on Federal land within the 
5
western States, including National Parks, National 
6
Monuments, national conservation areas, national 
7
grassland, components of the National Wilderness 
8
Preservation System, wilderness study areas, and 
9
national wildlife refuges; 
10
(3) since statehood land grant land owned by 
11
the western States are typically scattered across the 
12
public land, creation of Federal conservation areas 
13
often include State land grant parcels with substan-
14
tially different management mandates, making land 
15
and resource management more difficult, expensive, 
16
and controversial for both Federal land managers 
17
and the western States; and 
18
(4) allowing the western States to relinquish 
19
State trust land within Federal conservation areas 
20
and to select replacement land from the public land 
21
within the respective western States, would— 
22
(A) enhance management of Federal con-
23
servation areas by allowing unified management 
24
of those areas; and 
25
