SEC. 201. FINDINGS. 
9
Congress finds the following: 
10
(1) In every congressional district, career and 
11
technical education programs and career-connected 
12
pathways programs play a vital role in ensuring 
13
workers remain competitive in high-wage, high-skill, 
14
and in-demand career fields, including computer 
15
science, robotics, information technology, health 
16
care, and the skilled trades, all of which have hun-
17
dreds of thousands of job openings across the United 
18
States. 
19
(2) Every student should have access to career 
20
and technical education opportunities to learn how 
21
their academic background will prepare them for 
22
postsecondary education and a career. 
23
(3) Curriculum and course offerings should not 
24
be based on the assumption that every student has 
25
23:24 Sep 16, 2021
H5252
khammond on DSKJM1Z7X2PROD with BILLS
31 
•HR 5252 IH
the same academic needs, interests, and goals. In-
1
stead, schools should prepare students for their indi-
2
vidualized career goals by providing opportunities for 
3
students to discover and delve into their interests. 
4
These opportunities may include career and tech-
5
nical education, personalized learning, apprentice-
6
ships, early college and dual enrollment, and lan-
7
guage immersion programs. 
8
(4) Specifically, career and technical education 
9
and dual enrollment programs integrate classroom 
10
learning with technical, job-specific skills to prepare 
11
students for high-skill careers in industries such as 
12
information 
technology, 
manufacturing, 
health 
13
science, nursing, medical professions, construction, 
14
engineering, and more. Under the Carl D. Perkins 
15
Vocational and Technical Education Act (20 U.S.C. 
16
2301 et seq.), States receive funding to integrate ca-
17
reer pathway programs with academic learning for 
18
students who choose to enroll in career and technical 
19
education programs. 
20
(5) Career and technical education programs 
21
currently serve 12,500,000 high school and college 
22
students and boast a high school graduation rate of 
23
about 90 percent, which is 15 percent higher than 
24
the national average.

(6) Career-connected learning programs, which 
1
integrate college preparatory academics, technical 
2
training, work-based learning, and support, have had 
3
positive outcomes for students. 
4
(7) According to the Association for Career and 
5
Technical Education, 6 out of 10 students plan to 
6
pursue a career related to the career-connected 
7
learning programs they are exploring in high school. 
8
(8) Many skills-based industries have chron-
9
ically struggled to fill open positions, as they face an 
10
increasing number of retiring baby boomers as well 
11
as a lack of qualified candidates with technical skills. 
12
For instance, of the 3,400,000 manufacturing jobs 
13
expected to open over the next decade, 2,000,000 
14
are projected to go unfilled, accounting for approxi-
15
mately 9 percent, or $2,400,000,000, in forgone 
16
yearly revenue. 
17
(9) While career and technical education models 
18
have been piloted across the United States, grant 
19
programs need to be expanded to not only encourage 
20
additional school districts to offer students opportu-
21
nities for career-connected learning, including ap-
22
prenticeships, and project-based learning pathways
