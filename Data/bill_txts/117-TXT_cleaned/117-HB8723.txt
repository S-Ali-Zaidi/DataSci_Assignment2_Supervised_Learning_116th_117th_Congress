A BILL 
To amend the Energy Act of 2020 to require the Secretary 
of Energy to establish a program to accelerate the avail-
ability of commercially produced high-assay, low-enriched 
uranium in the United States and to make high-assay, 
low-enriched uranium produced from Department of En-
ergy inventories available for use in advanced nuclear 
reactors, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
4
It is the sense of Congress that— 
5
(1) the Department of Energy (referred to in 
6
this section as the ‘‘Department’’) should prioritize 
7
activities to establish a domestic high-assay, low-en-
8
riched uranium (referred to in this section as 
9
‘‘HALEU’’) enrichment capability, consistent with 
10
subsection (c) of section 2001 of the Energy Act of 
11
2020 (42 U.S.C. 16281); 
12
(2) domestic HALEU enrichment will not be 
13
commercially available at the scale needed in time to 
14
meet the needs of advanced nuclear reactor dem-
15
onstration projects; and 
16
(3) the Department needs to make available 
17
HALEU, produced from inventories owned by the 
18
Department, for use by advanced nuclear reactors 
19
consistent with subsection (d) of section 2001 of the 
20
Energy Act of 2020 (42 U.S.C. 16281), until such 
21
time as commercial HALEU enrichment capability 
22
exists consistent with that subsection.
