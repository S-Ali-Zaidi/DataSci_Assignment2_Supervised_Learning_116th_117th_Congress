RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the goals and ideals of ‘‘National 
Hydrocephalus Awareness Month’’. 
Whereas hydrocephalus, an abnormal accumulation of cere-
brospinal fluid in the brain, is a life-threatening condition 
that affects approximately 1,000,000 Americans of all 
ages; 
Whereas, each year, one in 770 babies develops hydro-
cephalus; 
Whereas hospitalization charges for pediatric hydrocephalus 
cases alone cost the United States health care system 
$2,000,000,000 per year; 
Whereas adults living with hydrocephalus add exponentially 
to health care system costs, as well as costs related to re-
duced productivity in the workplace;

Whereas the incidence of undiagnosed and untreated hydro-
cephalus in older Americans can result in unnecessary 
confinement to assisted living facilities and nursing 
homes; 
Whereas up to two-thirds (24,000 potential cases) of our cur-
rent and former military servicemembers suffering from 
moderate to severe traumatic brain injuries are at risk of 
developing hydrocephalus; 
Whereas many individuals with hydrocephalus live with other 
serious medical comorbidities, particularly seniors who 
have Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus, putting them at a 
higher risk for severe illness from COVID–19; 
Whereas there is no cure for this condition, and the only 
treatment is costly brain surgery which frequently must 
be repeated to replace the shunt, a medical device that 
is the most common treatment for the condition and has 
one of the highest failure rates of all medical devices; 
Whereas various research studies are currently being con-
ducted in the United States in order to better under-
stand, prevent, and treat hydrocephalus; 
Whereas organizations, such as the Pediatric Hydrocephalus 
Foundation and the Hydrocephalus Association, serve as 
global leaders for hydrocephalus awareness, education, 
support, advocacy, and research funding; 
Whereas the Pediatric Hydrocephalus Foundation established 
‘‘National Hydrocephalus Awareness Month’’ in 2009; 
and 
Whereas the Pediatric Hydrocephalus Foundation and the 
Hydrocephalus Association recognize September as ‘‘Na-
tional Hydrocephalus Awareness Month’’: Now, therefore, 
be it
