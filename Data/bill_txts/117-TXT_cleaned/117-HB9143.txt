A BILL 
To prevent the use of additional Internal Revenue Service 
funds from being used for audits of taxpayers with tax-

and middle-income earning American taxpayers from an 
onslaught of audits from an army of new Internal Rev-
enue Service auditors funded by an unprecedented, near-
ly $80,000,000,000, infusion of new funds. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
