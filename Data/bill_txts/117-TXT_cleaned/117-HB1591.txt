Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
1
(a) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The manufacturing sector consists of estab-
3
lishments that are primarily engaged in the trans-
4
formation of materials, substances, or components 
5
into products. 
6
(2) A healthy, innovative manufacturing base 
7
plays a central role in the United States economy 
8
and national defense. 
9
(3) The Federal Government supports manufac-
10
turing in a variety of ways; support for manufac-
11
turing-related activities are dispersed across several 
12
agencies in the executive branch. 
13
(4) Manufacturing employment, output, and ex-
14
ports are impacted by a myriad of factors including 
15
the state of infrastructure and transportation, tax 
16
policies, environmental and other business regula-
17
tions, trade policies, innovation ecosystems, work-
18
force development, and education initiatives. Legisla-
19
tion and executive actions can have unintended im-
20
pact on the growth of manufacturing in the United 
21
States. 
22
(5) Manufacturers account for 11 percent of 
23
the total gross domestic product output in the 
24
United States, employing 8 percent of the workforce. 
25
Total output from manufacturing is more than 2 
26

•HR 1591 IH
trillion dollars. There are nearly 13 million manufac-
1
turing employees in the United States, with an aver-
2
age annual compensation of about $85,000. 
3
(6) Given that 99 percent of manufacturing 
4
firms are small and medium size enterprises with a 
5
predominantly local employment footprint, workforce 
6
development programs must be rooted in local cir-
7
cumstance and requirements. 
8
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
9
gress that a well-designed National Manufacturing Strat-
10
egy would benefit the United States economy in several 
11
important ways, including the following: 
12
(1) A revitalized manufacturing sector would 
13
enable the United States to increase its economic 
14
growth from domestic and export production. 
15
(2) Manufacturing jobs continue to pay higher 
16
wages and benefits than non-manufacturing jobs. 
17
Average domestic wages would rise in response to 
18
growing manufacturing output. 
19
(3) Manufacturing industries undertake two- 
20
thirds of private-sector research and development, 
21
which fuels the innovation that serves as a primary 
22
engine of economic growth. A growing manufac-
23
turing sector would help lay the foundations for fu-
24
ture economic expansion. 
25

(4) The United States would expand its long- 
1
standing leadership in advanced manufacturing tech-
2
nologies with Federal investments in manufacturing 
3
research and development, education, and workforce 
4
training. 
5
(5) There exists a longstanding connection be-
6
tween domestic manufacturing, national defense, and 
7
homeland security. A strong and innovative manu-
8
facturing industry will maintain the technical superi-
9
ority of the United States military and secure supply 
10
chain integrity.
