SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Iran Hostages Con-
2
gressional Gold Medal Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
The Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) On January 20, 1981, United States dip-
6
lomats, military personnel, and civilians were re-
7
leased after being held hostage for 444 days by mili-
8
tant student supporters of Iran’s Ayatollah Ruhollah 
9
Khomeini in a violation of international law. They 
10
were taken from the United States Embassy in 
11
Tehran, Iran, this came to be known as the Iran 
12
Hostage Crisis. 
13
(2) The hostages were subjected to intense 
14
physical and psychological torture throughout their 
15
captivity, such as mock execution, beatings, solitary 
16
confinement, and inhospitable living conditions. 
17
(3) Throughout their time held, they were rou-
18
tinely told to denounce the United States, when they 
19
refused, they were tortured, yet they remained 
20
strong in their spirit. 
21
(4) One hostage wrote ‘‘Viva la roja, blanco, y 
22
azul’’ which translates to ‘‘Long live the red, white, 
23
and blue’’ on the wall of his cell as a reminder of 
24
the values he swore to protect.

(5) The hostages showed extraordinary courage 
1
by continually engaging in acts of resistance against 
2
their captors in the face of gross violations of their 
3
human rights, such as refusing to sign condemna-
4
tions of the United States. 
5
(6) Many of the hostages still experience trau-
6
ma as a result of the events of the crisis and deserve 
7
to have their suffering recognized. 
8
(7) While 35 of the hostages are still living, it 
9
is important that we reflect on their resilience and 
10
strength which serve as an example to current gen-
11
erations. Let us acknowledge them as heroes, who 
12
stood in positions of great tribulation but who, for 
13
us, endured so that we may know the blessing of 
14
being an American. Let us be more like them. 
15
(8) On January 22, 1981, President Jimmy 
16
Carter met with the hostages in West Germany and 
17
stated, ‘‘One of the acts in my life which has been 
18
the most moving and gratifying in meeting with and 
19
discussing the future and the past with the now lib-
20
erated Americans who were held hostage in Iran for 
21
so long. I pointed out to them that, since their cap-
22
ture by the Iranian terrorists and their being held 
23
in this despicable act of savagery, that the American 
24
people’s hearts have gone out to them and the na-

tion has been united as perhaps never before in his-
1
tory and that the prayers that have gone up from 
2
the people throughout the world to God for their 
3
safety have finally been answered.’’. 
4
(9) On January 28, 1981, when welcoming the 
5
hostages home, President Ronald Reagan stated, 
6
‘‘You‘ve come home to a people who for 444 days 
7
suffered the pain of your imprisonment, prayed for 
8
your safety, and most importantly, shared your de-
9
termination that the spirit of free men and women 
10
is not a fit subject for barter. You’ve represented 
11
under great stress the highest traditions of public 
12
service. Your conduct is symbolic of the millions of 
13
professional diplomats, military personnel, and oth-
14
ers who have rendered service to their country.’’. 
15
(10) During the 444 days the brave Americans 
16
were held, the rest of the country held its breath, 
17
waiting for news of the hostages. The country hoped 
18
and prayed together, as one, for the hostages’ safe 
19
return. 
20
(11) United States Ambassador to Iran from 
21
1979 to 1980 Bruce Laingen, the highest ranking 
22
diplomat held hostage, summed up the experience by 
23
saying ‘‘Fifty-three Americans who will always have 
24
a love affair with this country and who join with you

in a prayer of thanksgiving for the way in which this 
1
crisis has strengthened the spirit and resilience and 
2
strength that is the mark of a truly free society.’’. 
3
It is now our responsibility to honor the spirit, resil-
4
ience, and strength that the hostages displayed dur-
5
ing their 444 days of imprisonment. 
6
(12) Now, more than four decades later, we 
7
continue to honor the hostages. The recipients of 
8
this award are heroes in every sense of the word. 
9
They are role models that wore their American pride 
10
with esteem and have allowed for subsequent genera-
11
tions to appreciate the blessing of being an Amer-
12
ican. Today, as we prepare to mark 40 years after 
13
their release, we acknowledge their endurance, 
14
strength, and contributions to seeing a more peace-
15
ful world. They suffered for America and now it is 
16
our duty to recognize them for it.
