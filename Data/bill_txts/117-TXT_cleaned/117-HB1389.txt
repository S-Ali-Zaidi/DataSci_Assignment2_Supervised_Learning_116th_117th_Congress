SEC. 5. STUDY ON PROTECTION OF FORESTS FROM NON- 
6
NATIVE PESTS AND PATHOGENS. 
7
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following find-
8
ings: 
9
(1) many separate Federal agencies have impor-
10
tant roles to play in addressing non-native plant 
11
pests and pathogens for stewardship and manage-
12
ment of American forests; 
13
(2) because of a lack of national policy non-na-
14
tive pests of forests have a low priority within all 
15
Federal agencies; 
16
(3) efforts to prevent the introduction and 
17
spread of such pests and pathogens, and especially 
18
to reduce the resulting damage and restore tree spe-
19
cies to forests, lack coordination and action. 
20
(b) STUDY.—The Secretary of Agriculture shall enter 
21
into an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences, 
22
or another nongovernmental entity the Secretary deter-
23
mines to be most appropriate, under which the National 
24
Academy of Sciences (or such other entity) will analyze 
25

•HR 1389 IH
available resources in Federal agencies for research of, 
1
and solutions to non-native forest pests and pathogens. 
2
Such study shall make recommendations with respect to— 
3
(1) establishing a national policy to counter ef-
4
fectively the threat posed by non-native insects and 
5
disease pathogens to tree species, including pre-
6
venting the introduction and spread of such pests, 
7
minimizing the damage caused by such pests, and 
8
restoring affected tree species to the forest; 
9
(2) correcting the lack of mission identification 
10
and leadership among Federal agencies with respon-
11
sibility for management and repair of the decimation 
12
of affected species and associated ecological destruc-
13
tion; 
14
(3) addressing the low prioritization by such 
15
agencies of non-native pests of forests; 
16
(4) identifying expertise and site and facility re-
17
sources within such agencies, and improving coordi-
18
nation among such agencies with respect to manage-
19
ment of such damage, including coordination with 
20
academic institutions and other appropriate non- 
21
profits; and 
22
(5) the establishment within the Department of 
23
Agriculture of a center for forest pest control, pre-
24
vention, and species restoration, including potential

4
the Agriculture Research Service, the National Insti-
5
tute of Food and Agriculture, the Natural Resources

7
other agency the Secretary determines is appro-
8
priate.

(c) CONSULTATION.—The agreement referred to in 
10
subsection (b) shall require the National Academy of 
11
Sciences (or such other entity), in conducting such study, 
12
to consult with specialists in entomology, genetics, forest 
13
pathology, tree breeding, forest and urban ecology, and 
14
invasive species management. 
15
(d) USE OF EXISTING RESOURCES.—The agreement 
16
referred to in subsection (b) shall require the National 
17
Academy of Sciences (or such other entity), in making rec-
18
ommendations pursuant to the study conducted under 
19
such subsection, to make recommendations that use exist-
