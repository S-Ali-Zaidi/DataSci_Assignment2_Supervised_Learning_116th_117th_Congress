A BILL 
To require the Secretary of Energy to complete and publish 
a study and develop a plan related to the ability of 
the electric system to meet the electricity demand of 
new electric vehicle charging infrastructure, and for other 
purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3

(a) STUDY.— 
5
(1) IN
GENERAL.—Not later than 6 months 
6
after the date of enactment of this section, the Sec-
7
retary of Energy shall complete and publish on the 
8
website of the Department of Energy a study that 
9
assesses the ability of the electric system to meet the 
10
electricity demand of electric vehicle charging infra-
11
structure that is installed on or after the date of en-
12
actment of this section. 
13
(2) INCLUSIONS.—The study completed and 
14
published under paragraph (1) shall— 
15
(A) include an estimate of— 
16
(i) the amount of growth in the use of 
17
electric vehicles that is necessary to meet 
18
the President’s greenhouse gas reduction 
19
target; and 
20
(ii) how much additional electrical 
21
generation, transmission, and distribution 
22
capacity will need to be added to the elec-
23
tric system to meet the electricity demand 
24
of electric vehicle charging infrastructure 
25
that is installed on or after the date of en-

actment of this section, including how such 
1
electricity demand varies by geography, 
2
population density, vehicle-grid interaction 
3
scenario, and the time of usage of such 
4
electric vehicle charging infrastructure; 
5
and 
6
(B) identify geographic areas in which 
7
greater investment in the electric system is nec-
8
essary to meet the electricity demand of electric 
9
vehicle charging infrastructure installed on or 
10
after the date of enactment of this section in 
11
such geographic areas. 
12
(b) PLAN AND RECOMMENDATIONS.—Not later than 
13
3 months after the date on which the study is published 
14
under subsection (a), the Secretary of Energy shall, in co-
15
ordination with the Building a Better Grid Initiative of 
16
the Office of Electricity and the Vehicle Technologies Of-
17
fice of the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable En-
18
ergy— 
19
(1) develop a plan, based on such study, for 
20
how the Department of Energy may assist the elec-
21
tric system with meeting the increase in the demand 
22
for electricity estimated in such study; and 
23
(2) provide to Congress recommendations for

(1) ELECTRIC
VEHICLE
CHARGING
INFRA-
7
STRUCTURE.—The term ‘‘electric vehicle charging 
8
infrastructure’’ means the charging infrastructure 
9
necessary to support light duty, medium duty, and 
10
heavy duty on-road electric vehicles, including such 
11
charging infrastructure that is located at a work-
12
place, recreational destination, vehicle corridor, 
13
home, or depot. 
14
(2) PRESIDENT’S
GREENHOUSE
GAS
REDUC-
15
TION TARGET.—The term ‘‘President’s greenhouse 
16
gas reduction target’’ means the President’s target 
17
of reducing greenhouse gas pollution by 50 to 52 
18
percent from 2005 levels by 2030.
