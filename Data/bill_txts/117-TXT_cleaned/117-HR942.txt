RESOLUTION 
Recognizing and celebrating the significance of Black History 
Month. 
Whereas the theme for Black History Month 2022 is ‘‘Black 
Health and Wellness’’, which considers activities, rituals, 
and initiatives that Black communities have done to be 
well; 
Whereas Black communities continue to face health chal-
lenges unique in their severity in the United States; 
Whereas COVID–19 data show that Black-American popu-
lations in the United States experience higher rates of 
COVID–19-related hospitalization and death compared 
with non-Hispanic White populations; 
Whereas, in Michigan, Black Americans are 133 percent 
more likely to contract the novel coronavirus and are 
overrepresented for deaths related to COVID–19, ac-
counting for 40 percent of all deaths statewide; 
Whereas structural racism and residential segregation have 
forced a disproportionate number of Black Americans 
into low-income neighborhoods that make social isolation 
practices more challenging to implement due to physical 
crowding and lack of resources; 
Whereas a national analysis of county-level data confirmed 
that these adverse socioeconomic conditions have caused

counties with higher proportions of Black Americans to 
have higher numbers of COVID–19 cases and deaths; 
Whereas inequities in education, employment, income, polic-
ing and incarceration, health care access, chronic stress, 
and multiple other factors that affect health increase, to 
varying degrees, Black Americans’ risk for morbidity and 
mortality in general; 
Whereas on average, although Black women are younger 
(36.1 years) than United States women overall (39.6 
years), they have a higher prevalence of many health con-
ditions, including heart disease, stroke, cancers, diabetes, 
maternal morbidities, obesity, and stress; 
Whereas infant mortality rates for children born to non-His-
panic Black women are twice as high as those for chil-
dren born to non-Hispanic White women; 
Whereas it is estimated that non-Hispanic Black women are 
three to almost four times more likely to die while preg-
nant or within one year postpartum than their non-His-
panic White and Latina counterparts; 
Whereas research suggests that chronic exposure to environ-
mental stressors, such as racism, across the life span con-
tributes to the weathering of the health of Black women, 
increasing their allostatic load and, consequently, compro-
mising their reproductive health; 
Whereas obesity is a major source of morbidity and mortality 
for all United States populations, but non-Hispanic Black 
Americans have a higher age-adjusted prevalence of obe-
sity than any other racial/ethnic group, with estimates 
ranging from 34 percent to 50 percent;

Whereas there are numerous institutions and individuals 
fighting to improve these health outcomes for Black indi-
viduals; 
Whereas four historically Black (HBCU) medical schools are 
currently 
in 
operation: 
Meharry 
Medical 
College 
(Meharry), Howard University College of Medicine (How-
ard), Morehouse School of Medicine (Morehouse), and 
Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science 
(CDU); 
Whereas 13 other HBCU medical schools were operating in 
the late 1800s to early 1900s and were closed owing to 
low enrollment and limited resources; 
Whereas HBCU medical schools have a two-fold mission: to 
diversify the health care workforce and deliver high-qual-
ity and compassionate care to underserved and under-
privileged populations; 
Whereas Morehouse School of Medicine’s M.D. program is 
noted for its low student-faculty ratio and for successfully 
matching nearly 70 percent of its graduates in primary 
care specialties; 
Whereas notable alumni of Meharry Medical College include 
the first Black-American woman epidemiologist, Theresa 
Green Reed, and the first Black-American president of 
the American Heart Association, Edward S. Cooper; 
Whereas Bernard Tyson (1959–2019) was the first Black 
chairman and CEO of Kaiser Permanente and was 
named one of Time Magazine’s 100 Most Influential Peo-
ple in 2017 for his dedicated mission to provide quality 
and affordable health care for all; 
Whereas Dr. Ala Stanford, a pediatric surgeon in Philadel-
phia, Pennsylvania, launched the Black Doctors COVID–

19 Consortium (BDCC), an independent testing effort 
that has tested over 10,000 people; 
Whereas Dr. Betty Smith Williams is not only the first Black 
person to graduate from the Frances Payne Bolton 
School of Nursing in Cleveland, Ohio, but she also went 
on to become the first Black person to teach at the col-
lege or university level in the entire State of California; 
Whereas Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, the first Black woman to 
be the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and 
Medicaid Services, is well-known for playing a major part 
in implementing the Patient Protection and Affordable 
Care Act (ACA) during the Obama administration; 
Whereas Tracey D. Brown is the first Black woman and per-
son living with type 2 diabetes to be CEO of the Amer-
ican Diabetes Association (ADA), the largest voluntary 
health organization in the United States; 
Whereas because of the efforts of these and other heroic indi-
viduals, health outcomes for Black Americans have seen 
massive improvement; 
Whereas according to the National Center for Health Statis-
tics, the infant mortality rate among Black Americans 
has dropped by more than 20 percent since the late 
1990s; 
Whereas, since 1990, the overall cancer death rate has 
dropped faster in Black Americans than White Ameri-
cans among both men and women, largely driven by more 
rapid declines in cancers of the lung, colorectum, and 
prostate for Black Americans; 
Whereas, from 2006 to 2014, the teen birth rate among 
Black Americans declined by 44 percent;

Whereas of the more than 20,000,000 people who have 
gained health care coverage under the ACA, 2,800,000 of 
them are Black Americans; 
Whereas due to improvements in hygiene, medicine, and other 
public health measures, life expectancy for Black Ameri-
cans has nearly doubled since the turn of the 20th cen-
tury, a win for Black health which cannot be overstated; 
Whereas the month of February is officially celebrated as 
Black History Month, which dates to 1926 when Dr. 
Carter G. Woodson set aside a special period in February 
to recognize the heritage and achievement of Black 
Americans; and 
Whereas the birthdays of Abraham Lincoln and Frederick 
Douglass inspired the creation of Negro History Week, 
the precursor to Black History Month: Now, therefore, be 
it
