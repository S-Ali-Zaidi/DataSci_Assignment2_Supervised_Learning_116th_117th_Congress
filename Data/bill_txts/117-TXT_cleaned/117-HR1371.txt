ries, and fatalities; 
Whereas highway-rail grade crossing and trespassing inci-
dents constituted approximately 95 percent of all rail-re-
lated fatalities during 2021;

ings has decreased by 13 percent; and 
(2) the number of gates at such crossings has in-
creased by 39 percent; 
Whereas, in 2021, 48 percent of all highway-rail grade cross-
ing incidents and 68 percent of all fatal highway-rail 
grade crossing incidents occurred at gated highway-rail 
grade crossings; 
Whereas preliminary Federal statistics indicate that 2,145 
highway-grade crossing incidents occurred in the United 
States in 2021, resulting in 235 deaths and another 669 
individuals injured; 
Whereas many incidents between trains and motor vehicles or 
pedestrians could have been prevented by increased edu-
cation, engineering, and enforcement; 
Whereas Operation Lifesaver, the foremost public information 
and education program on rail safety, administers a pub-
lic education program about grade-crossing safety and 
trespassing prevention; 
Whereas, during Rail Safety Week, from September 19

aged to take added caution as motorists or pedestrians 
approach tracks or trains;
