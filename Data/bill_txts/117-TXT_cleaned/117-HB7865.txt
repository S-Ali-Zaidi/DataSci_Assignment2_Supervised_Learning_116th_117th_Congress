14
velopment or occupancy in flood-prone

floodproofing nor elevation to the base

flood elevation is practicable; and

‘‘(II) if such structure is located 
17
within a designated regulatory flood-
18
way, such official has determined that 
19
the repair or improvement does not 
20
result in any increase in base flood

levels during the base flood discharge.

that the variance will not result in in-
