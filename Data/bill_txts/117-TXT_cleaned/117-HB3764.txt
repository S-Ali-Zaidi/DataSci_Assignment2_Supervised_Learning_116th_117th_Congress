(2) DETERMINATION
OF
ADVERSE
IMPACT.—

7
posing agency and subject to public comment, shall 
8
determine whether the proposed agency action will 
9
cause an adverse impact on the carbon storage, car-
10
bon sequestration, ecosystem, or habitat of a blue 
11
carbon area of significance. 
12
(3) ALTERNATIVE.—With respect to any pro-
13
posed action the Administrator determines will have 
14
an adverse impact under paragraph (2), the pro-
15
posing agency, in consultation with the Adminis-

trator, shall determine whether there is an alter-
17
native action that would prevent such adverse im-
18
pact and fulfill the purpose of the proposed action.

(A) in consultation with the Administrator, 
3
take measures to mitigate such adverse impact;

9
storage, lasting an equivalent time period as the 
10
carbon storage lost by the adverse impact; 
11
(C) demonstrate quantitatively, using the 
12
best available science, that the carbon storage 
13
offset will result in a net increase in ecological 
14
carbon storage and is located in close proximity 
15
to the original site to keep the affected commu-
16
nities whole;

18
for a period of time to be determined by the

SEC. 211. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE IMPOR-
3
TANCE OF OFFSHORE WIND ENERGY. 
4
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that— 
5
(1) the United States should aggressively re-
6
duce greenhouse gas emissions from United States 
7
public lands and oceans and strive to achieve net- 
8
zero emissions as soon as possible; 
9
(2) the United States can and must address 
10
this climate crisis by putting people to work building 
11
the necessary infrastructure to reduce carbon emis-
12
sions; 
13
(3) the United States offshore wind resources 
14
must be responsibly harnessed in order to both rap-
15
idly reduce our carbon emissions and put people 
16
back to work; and 
17
(4) achieving the goal of 30 gigawatts of off-
18
shore wind energy capacity by 2030 is anticipated to 
19
result in the creation of tens of thousands of living 
20
wage, family-supporting union jobs while positioning 
21
America to lead a clean energy revolution and tackle 
22
the climate crisis. 
23
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
24
gress that— 
25
23:41 Jul 19, 2021
H3764
39 
•HR 3764 IH
(1) the United States should rapidly develop its 
1
offshore wind resources as a key part of achieving 
2
a national goal of net-zero emissions; 
3
(2) offshore wind lease areas should be deter-
4
mined by a robust and transparent stakeholder proc-
5
ess that incorporates early engagement and input 
6
from diverse user groups as well as Federal, State, 
7
Tribal, and local governments; 
8
(3) development of offshore wind resources 
9
must ensure ecosystem health and the protection of 
10
threatened and endangered species and their habi-
11
tats; and 
12
(4) permitting agencies must have sufficient re-
13
sources to carry out a robust and efficient review 
14
and permitting process.

8
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following find-
9
ings: 
10
(1) As a party to the Law of the Sea Conven-
11
tion, the United States would be a powerful voting 
12
Council member of the International Seabed Author-
13
ity, a body that is critical to negotiations regarding 
14
deep seabed mining, which is a practice that could 
15
have significant potential climate, environmental, 
16
and economic impacts. 
17
(2) Being party to the Convention and holding 
18
membership on the International Seabed Authority 
19
is in the United States’ best interests in regard to 
20
competition with other countries over future rare 
21
earth element resources found on the seafloor. 
22
(3) Without being party to the Convention, the 
23
United States cannot play a role in negotiating and 
24
providing international legitimacy to claims to the 
25
23:41 Jul 19, 2021
H3764
179 
•HR 3764 IH
Arctic, an area that is rapidly becoming more acces-
1
sible due to climate change. 
2
(4) As a party to the Convention, the United 
3
States would be better able to participate in negotia-
4
tions regarding the management of high seas fish 
5
stocks, migratory fish stocks, and marine mammals, 
6
which will become more important as the climate 
7
continues to change and species shift. 
8
(5) The Convention imposes minimum require-
9
ments for ocean protections; the United States is al-
10
ready meeting or exceeding those requirements and 
11
could therefore positively influence international ma-
12
rine conservation by being party to the Convention. 
13
(6) A diverse array of bipartisan Presidents and 
14
lawmakers, military leaders, industry stakeholders, 
15
and environmental organizations support ratification 
16
of the Convention, finding that it is in the United 
17
States’ best economic, political, and environmental 
18
interest to ratify. 
19
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
20
gress that— 
21
(1) the United States Senate should give its ad-
22
vice and consent to accession to the Law of the Sea 
23
Convention, adopted by the Third United Nations

5

6
(A) the Convention on the Territorial Sea

SEC. 1101. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS; PURPOSES. 
11
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following find-
12
ings: 
13
(1) The ocean and coastal waters of the United 
14
States are foundational to the economy, security, 
15
global competitiveness, and well-being of the United 
16
States and continuously serve the people of the 
17
United States and other countries as an important 
18
source of food, energy, economic productivity, recre-
19
ation, culture, beauty, and enjoyment. 
20
(2) Over many years, the resource productivity 
21
and water quality of the ocean and coastal areas of 
22
the United States have been diminished by pollution, 
23
increasing population demands, economic develop-

ment, and natural and man-made hazard events, 
1
both acute and chronic. 
2
(3) Ocean and coastal areas of the United 
3
States are managed by State and Federal resource 
4
agencies and regulated on an interstate and regional 
5
scale by various overlapping Federal authorities, 
6
thereby creating a significant need for interstate co-
7
ordination to enhance regional priorities, including 
8
the ecological and economic health of those areas. 
9
(4) Tribes and Indigenous communities have 
10
unique expertise and knowledge important for the 
11
stewardship of our ocean and coastal waters. 
12
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
13
gress that— 
14
(1) the United States should seek to support 
15
interstate coordination of shared regional priorities 
16
relating to the management, conservation, resilience, 
17
and restoration of ocean and coastal areas to maxi-
18
mize efficiencies through collaborative regional ef-
19
forts by regional ocean partnerships, in consultation 
20
with Federal and State agencies, Tribal govern-
21
ments, and local authorities; 
22
(2) such efforts would enhance existing and ef-
23
fective State coastal management efforts based on 
24
shared regional priorities; and 
25

•HR 3764 IH
(3) regional ocean partnerships should either 
1
directly include representation from Tribal govern-
2
ments or have dedicated consultation with such gov-
3
ernments. 
4
(c) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this subtitle are as 
5
follows: 
6
(1) To complement and expand cooperative vol-
7
untary efforts intended to manage and restore ocean 
8
and coastal areas spanning across multiple State 
9
boundaries. 
10
(2) To expand Federal support for monitoring, 
11
data management, and restoration activities in ocean 
12
and coastal areas. 
13
(3) To commit the United States to a com-
14
prehensive cooperative program to achieve improved 
15
water quality in, and improvements in the produc-
16
tivity of living resources of, all coastal ecosystems. 
17
(4) To authorize regional ocean partnerships as 
18
intergovernmental coordinators for shared interstate 
19
and regional priorities relating to the collaborative 
20
management of the large marine ecosystems, thereby 
21
reducing duplication of efforts and maximizing op-
22
portunities to leverage support in the ocean and 
23
coastal regions.

4
ing to support Tribal and Indigenous ocean and

•HR 3764 IH
whales and blue whales, die from vessel strikes each 
1
year. 
2
(4) Background ambient noise levels have in-
3
creased significantly since the 1950s and can be at-
4
tributed to vessel noise, impeding foraging, breeding, 
5
communication, and other behaviors of marine ani-
6
mals, including of threatened species and endan-
7
gered species. 
8
(5) Slower ship speeds reduce the lethality of 
9
vessel strikes on marine life, moderate underwater 
10
noise, and provide climate benefits through reduced 
11
fuel consumption and lower particulate emissions. 
12
(6) In 2019, the Vessel Speed Reduction Pro-
13
gram in the Santa Barbara Channel region and the 
14
San Francisco Bay region saved over 17,000 metric
