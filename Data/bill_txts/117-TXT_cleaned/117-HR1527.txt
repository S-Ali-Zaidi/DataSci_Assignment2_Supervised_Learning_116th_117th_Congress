RESOLUTION 
Condemning former President Donald J. Trump’s calls to 
terminate the Constitution on the basis of false allega-
tions of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 Presidential 
election. 
Whereas, on December 3, 2022, former President Donald J. 
Trump posted to the Truth Social media platform, ‘‘So, 
with the revelation of MASSIVE & WIDESPREAD 
FRAUD & DECEPTION in working closely with Big 
Tech Companies, the DNS, & the Democrat Party, do 
you throw the Presidential Election Results of 2020 OUT 
and declare the RIGHTFUL WINNER, or do you have 
a NEW ELECTION? A Massive Fraud of this type and 
magnitude allows for the termination of all rules, regula-
tions, and articles, even those found in the Constitution.

Our great ‘Founders’ did not want, and would not con-
done, False & Fraudulent Elections!’’; 
Whereas former President Trump’s false allegations of mas-
sive and widespread voter fraud in the 2020 Presidential 
election have not been substantiated; 
Whereas more than 60 lawsuits filed by former President 
Trump, the Trump campaign, or other entities on his be-
half challenging the 2020 Presidential election or its out-
come have been lost or dismissed in various Federal and 
State courts; 
Whereas former President Trump used these false allegations 
in a social media post as the basis to call for the termi-
nation of the ‘‘rules, regulations, and articles’’ in the 
Constitution; 
Whereas the Constitution is a sacrosanct document that 
guarantees the rule of law and free and equal elections 
in the United States; and 
Whereas calls for the termination of the Constitution in re-
sponse to losing a legitimately conducted Federal election 
are undemocratic: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—

(1) condemns former President Donald J.

Trump for calling for the termination of the rules,
