SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
The Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The Vietnam War, (1954–1975), a conflict 
3
that pitted the communist Government of North 
4
Vietnam and its allies in South Vietnam, known as 
5
the Viet Cong, against the Government of South 
6
Vietnam, involved thousands of U.S. servicemembers 
7
and volunteers over its course. U.S. military advis-
8
ers, present in small numbers throughout the 1950s, 
9
were introduced on a large scale beginning in 1961, 
10
and active combat units were introduced in 1965. As 
11
early as February 1962, the number of American 
12
military forces in Vietnam warranted the assignment 
13
of American Red Cross field directors. 
14
(2) Women were not subject to the Vietnam-era 
15
draft, but thousands volunteered. The first American 
16
Red Cross Field Directors were sent to South Viet-
17
nam in February 1962. The last Red Cross staff 
18
members to serve in-country departed in March 
19
1973. Official records indicate that a total of 1,120 
20
women served with the Red Cross in Vietnam during 
21
that 11-year period. Of that number, 627 were 
22
young women who were part of the organization’s 
23
Supplemental 
Recreation 
Activities 
Overseas 
24
(SRAO) program.

(3) Based on Red Cross estimates, around 
1
280,500 servicemen took part in these recreation 
2
programs and the women, affectionately known as 
3
‘‘Donut Dollies’’, traveled 27,000 miles by jeep, 
4
truck, airplane, and helicopter every month. Red 
5
Cross officials estimate that, during the seven years 
6
the program was in operation, the women logged 
7
over 2,125,000 miles. The first SRAO unit opened 
8
at Danang in September 1965. Others quickly fol-
9
lowed at Bien Hoa, Nha Trang, Cam Ranh Air 
10
Force and Army bases, Dian, Quang Tri, Phu Bai, 
11
Lai Khe, Dong Tam, Qui Nhon, Xuan Loc, and 
12
more. In all, there were 28 SRAO unit locations 
13
throughout the country. 
14
(4) Military commanders expressed high praise 
15
for the Red Cross volunteers, calling the services of 
16
the organization ‘‘indispensable’’ and ‘‘prime fac-
17
tors’’ in their efforts to maintain the high morale of 
18
their men and to look after their welfare. Writing to 
19
Red Cross national headquarters in 1968, General 
20
William Westmoreland, then commander of the U.S. 
21
forces in Southeast Asia, stated, ‘‘Serving our men 
22
on the battlefields here in Vietnam, the American 
23
Red Cross is a hotline to the folks back home, an

oasis in the heat of battle, and a comfort during 
1
hospitalization.’’. 
2
(5) These Red Cross volunteers shared with 
3
military personnel the hardship and privation of life 
4
in a war zone and were subject to the dangers of 
5
war. Many staff were injured. Five American Red 
6
Cross workers died in-country. Three of those were 
7
women, Hanna E. Crews, Virginia E. Kirsch, and 
8
Lucinda J. Richter, all of whom were members of 
9
the SRAO program. 
10
(6) The Donut Dollies volunteered to be sent to 
11
the frontlines to support servicemembers directly en-
12
gaged with the enemy during the Vietnam conflict. 
13
The extraordinary efforts of these volunteers 
14
throughout the extent of America’s involvement in 
15
the Vietnam conflict is deserving of official recogni-
16
tion.
