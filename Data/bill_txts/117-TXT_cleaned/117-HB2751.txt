A BILL 
To amend the Toxic Substances Control Act to codify a 
Federal cause of action and a type of remedy available 
for individuals significantly exposed to per- and 
polyfluoroalkyl substances, to encourage research and ac-
countability for irresponsible discharge of those sub-
stances, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘PFAS Accountability 
2
Act of 2021’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds that— 
5
(1) the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
6
tion has detected numerous perfluoroalkyl and 
7
polyfluoroalkyl substances (referred to in this Act as 
8
‘‘PFAS’’) in the blood serum of individuals in the 
9
United States, all of which come from manufac-
10
turing and use of PFAS by humans, as there is no 
11
natural source of PFAS in human blood; 
12
(2) peer-reviewed studies by other organizations 
13
have detected PFAS in the drinking water of at 
14
least 200,000,000 individuals in the United States; 
15
(3) PFAS are introduced into the market every 
16
year, and little research is conducted to ensure the 
17
safety of PFAS for individuals; 
18
(4) as of the day before the date of enactment 
19
of this Act, a Federal statutory cause of action does 
20
not exist for individuals harmed by the long-term ef-
21
fects of PFAS exposure; and 
22
(5) PFAS exposure, even at low levels, has been 
23
linked to chronic diseases, including cancer, repro-
24
ductive and developmental harms, and harms to the 
25
immune system.

SEC. 3. PURPOSES. 
1
The purposes of this Act are— 
2
(1) to encourage PFAS research and provide 
3
accountability for irresponsible PFAS manufacturing 
4
and irresponsible use of PFAS in manufacturing by 
5
codifying— 
6
(A) a Federal cause of action for individ-
7
uals significantly exposed to PFAS; and 
8
(B) a medical monitoring remedy for those 
9
individuals; 
10
(2) to help address harm to individuals signifi-
11
cantly exposed to PFAS by— 
12
(A) codifying that harm as an injury at 
13
law and equity; and 
14
(B) shifting the costs of medical moni-
15
toring from those individuals to the parties re-
16
sponsible for the exposure; and 
17
(3) to provide incentives for industry to fund 
18
PFAS safety research.

SEC. 4. CAUSE OF ACTION AND REMEDIES. 
20
(a) IN GENERAL.—The Toxic Substances Control Act 
21
is amended by inserting after section 24 (15 U.S.C. 2623) 
22
the following:

•HR 2751 IH
‘‘SEC. 25. INDIVIDUALS EXPOSED TO PERFLUOROALKYL 
1
AND POLYFLUOROALKYL SUBSTANCES. 
2
‘‘(a) DEFINITION OF PFAS.—In this section, the 
3
term ‘PFAS’ means a perfluoroalkyl or polyfluoroalkyl 
4
substance with at least 1 fully fluorinated carbon atom. 
5
‘‘(b) CAUSE OF ACTION.—An individual who is sig-
6
nificantly exposed to PFAS or has reasonable grounds to 
7
suspect that the individual was significantly exposed to 
8
PFAS may bring a claim, individually or on behalf of a 
9
class of similarly situated individuals, in any district court 
10
of the United States for appropriate legal and equitable 
11
relief against any person that— 
12
‘‘(1) engaged in any portion of a manufacturing 
13
process that created the PFAS to which the indi-
14
vidual was significantly exposed, including any 
15
telomer, fluorosurfactant, or toll manufacturing 
16
process leading to the creation of the PFAS to 
17
which the individual was significantly exposed; and 
18
‘‘(2) foresaw or reasonably should have foreseen 
19
that the creation or use of PFAS would result in 
20
human exposure to PFAS. 
21
‘‘(c) MEDICAL MONITORING.— 
22
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—A court may award medical 
23
monitoring to an individual or class of individuals 
24
bringing a claim under subsection (b) if—

•HR 2751 IH
‘‘(A) the individual or class has been sig-
1
nificantly exposed to PFAS; 
2
‘‘(B) as a result of that exposure, the indi-
3
vidual or class has suffered an increased risk of 
4
developing a disease associated with exposure to 
5
PFAS; 
6
‘‘(C) as a result of that increased risk, 
7
there is a reasonable basis for the individual or 
8
class to undergo periodic diagnostic medical ex-
9
aminations of a nature or frequency that is dif-
10
ferent from or additional to what would be pre-
11
scribed in the absence of the exposure; and 
12
‘‘(D) those medical examinations are effec-
13
tive in detecting a disease associated with expo-
14
sure to PFAS. 
15
‘‘(2) PRESUMPTION
OF
SIGNIFICANT
EXPO-
16
SURE.— 
17
‘‘(A) INDIVIDUALS.—An individual plain-
18
tiff shall be presumed to have been significantly 
19
exposed to PFAS under paragraph (1)(A) if the 
20
individual— 
21
‘‘(i) demonstrates that—

PFAS to which the individual was sig-
5
nificantly exposed; and

‘‘(II) the PFAS described in sub-
7
clause (I) were released into 1 or 
8
more areas where the individual would

have been exposed for a cumulative 
10
period of not less than 1 year; or

‘‘(ii) offers testing results that dem-
12
onstrate that PFAS or metabolites of 
13
PFAS have been or are currently detected 
14
in the body or blood serum of the indi-
15
vidual. 
16
‘‘(B) CLASS ACTIONS.—In a class action, a 
17
presumption of significant exposure to PFAS 
18
under paragraph (1)(A) shall be established for 
19
the class by—

‘‘(i) demonstrating that—

23

of the PFAS to which the class mem-
4
bers were significantly exposed; and

‘‘(II) the PFAS described in sub-
6
clause (I) were released into 1 or

more areas where a representative

portion of the class members would

have been exposed for a cumulative

period of not less than 1 year; or

16
mon exposure characteristics with the

‘‘(3) REBUTTING THE PRESUMPTION.— 
19
‘‘(A) IN
GENERAL.—A defendant may 
20
rebut a presumption of significant exposure 
21
with respect to an individual plaintiff or class 
22
member for which testing results are not of-

1
vidual or class member of testing that—

‘‘(i) uses a generally accepted method 
3
for detecting the particular PFAS or me-
4
tabolites of PFAS at issue; 
5
‘‘(ii) is performed by an independent 
6
provider agreed on by both parties; and 
7
‘‘(iii) confirms that the relevant PFAS 
8
or metabolites of PFAS likely were not 
9
present in the body of the individual or 
10
class member at the relevant time in a suf-
11
ficient quantity to qualify as significant ex-
12
posure under paragraph (1)(A). 
13
‘‘(B) COSTS.—A defendant shall be re-
14
sponsible for the costs of testing under subpara-
15
graph (A).

‘‘(C) INDEPENDENT
PROVIDER.—If both 
17
parties cannot agree on an independent pro-
18
vider under subparagraph (A)(ii), the court

increased risk of developing a disease associated 
1
with exposure to any individual PFAS or group 
2
of PFAS under paragraph (1)(B), a court may 
3
lower the standard for scientific proof with re-
4
gard to the increased risk of developing that 
5
disease until independent and reliable toxi-
6
cological data is available with respect to that

individual PFAS or group of PFAS. 
8
‘‘(B) ORDERING STUDIES.—To make avail-
9
able independent and reliable toxicological data 
10
described in subparagraph (A) with respect to 
11
an individual PFAS or group of PFAS, a court

may order new or additional epidemiological,

of that individual PFAS or group of PFAS as 
15
part of a medical monitoring remedy awarded

under paragraph (1).

18
gress that courts should encourage more reliable and inde-
19
pendent research into the latent health effects of PFAS.

‘‘(e) EFFECT ON STATE LAW CLAIMS AND REM-
21
EDIES.—Nothing in this section—
