SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:

•HR 7207 IH
(1) From 1959 to 1999, Venezuela, officially 
1
known as the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, had 
2
a form of government that embraced democratic 
3
principles. 
4
(2) In 1999, Hugo Cha´vez was elected as the 
5
President of Venezuela, where he maintained power 
6
by redistributing the country’s vast oil reserves to-
7
wards social welfare programs, suppressing dissent 
8
and independent media, and corrupting Venezuela’s 
9
democratic institutions, while simultaneously nation-
10
alizing the country’s private businesses, which he did 
11
so until his death on March 5, 2013. 
12
(3) On April 24, 2013, Nicola´s Maduro became 
13
President of Venezuela, notwithstanding multiple 
14
claims of election fraud and constitutional violations 
15
against Maduro. 
16
(4) During this time, Venezuela’s economy had 
17
become strongly dependent on the exportation of oil, 
18
with crude accounting for 86 percent of its exports. 
19
(5) However, in 2014, Venezuela entered into 
20
an economic recession, which led to the Venezuelan 
21
regime’s partnership with Petro´leos de Venezuela, 
22
S.A. (PDVSA), a state oil company, to combat the 
23
highly fluctuating price of oil in Venezuela along 
24
19:53 Mar 29, 2022

•HR 7207 IH
with the country’s overall steep decrease in oil pro-
1
duction. 
2
(6) In 2015, Venezuela’s economic struggles 
3
continued, with Venezuela having the world’s highest 
4
rate of inflation that surpassed 100 percent, result-
5
ing from the Maduro regime’s socialist economic pol-
6
icy that ultimately redistributed the oil-generated 
7
wealth to Venezuela’s oligarchs. 
8
(7) In January 2016, Maduro declared an ‘‘eco-
9
nomic emergency’’ due to the country’s inability to 
10
provide for basic human needs to its citizens, leading 
11
to riots in the streets of Venezuela. 
12
(8) In 2017, Maduro announced that leading 
13
opposition parties would be barred from taking part 
14
in the country’s Presidential election, which led the 
15
United States and other countries formally recog-
16
nizing Juan Guaido´ as the President of Venezuela, 
17
although countries such as China, Russia, Cuba, and 
18
Iran still continued to recognize President Nicola´s 
19
Maduro. 
20
(9) In August 2019, President Donald Trump 
21
signed an Executive order to impose tough sanctions 
22
against Maduro’s totalitarian regime. 
23
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
24
gress that Congress— 
25
19:53 Mar 29, 2022

•HR 7207 IH
(1) recognizes that Venezuela has been im-
1
pacted by hyperinflation, rampant crime, and signifi-
2
cant government corruption; 
3
(2) condemns the totalitarian Maduro regime 
4
and calls for the return of constitutional democratic 
5
government to Venezuela similar to the form of gov-
6
ernment that existed in the country from 1959 to 
7
1999; and 
8
(3) calls on President Joseph Biden to use rel-
9
evant constitutional and statutory authorities that 
10
grant emergency powers to waive unnecessary envi-
11
ronmental permitting requirements until the United 
12
States can reliably produce enough oil and natural 
13
gas to recapture America’s global energy dominance.

SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.

17
ezuela for freedom and democracy;

19

20
from Venezuela in the midst of the ongoing Russian 
21
attack on Ukraine; 
22
(3) to stress the importance of American energy 
23
independence, particularly from countries such as 
24
Russia and Venezuela; and
