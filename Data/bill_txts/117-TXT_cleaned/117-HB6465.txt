SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY. 
1
(a) FINDINGS.—The Congress makes the following 
2
findings: 
3
(1) Women and girls possess the same funda-
4
mental human rights and civil rights as men and are 
5
essential to the formation of stable, peaceful soci-
6
eties. 
7
(2) Approximately 126,000,000 women and 
8
girls are missing from the world population due to 
9
systematic violence against women and girls, par-
10
ticularly sex-selection abortions, according to the 
11
United Nations Population Fund. 
12
(3) United States law prohibits the dissimilar 
13
treatment of males and females who are similarly 
14
situated and prohibits sex discrimination in various 
15
contexts, including the provision of employment, 
16
education, housing, health insurance coverage, and 
17
athletics. 
18
(4) A ‘‘sex-selection abortion’’ is an abortion 
19
undertaken for purposes of eliminating an unborn 
20
child of an undesired sex. Sex-selection abortion is 
21
described by scholars and civil rights advocates as 
22
an act of sex-based or gender-based violence, predi-
23
cated on sex discrimination. By definition, sex-selec-
24
tion abortions do not implicate the health of the 
25

H6465
3 
•HR 6465 IH
mother of the unborn, but instead are elective proce-
1
dures motivated by sex or gender bias. 
2
(5) The targeted victims of sex-selection abor-
3
tions performed in the United States and worldwide 
4
are overwhelmingly female. 
5
(6) Sex-selection abortions are not expressly 
6
prohibited by United States law, and only 7 States 
7
ban abortions for reason of sex selection at some 
8
point in pregnancy. Sex is an immutable char-
9
acteristic ascertainable at the earliest stages of 
10
human development through existing medical tech-
11
nology and procedures commonly in use, including 
12
maternal-fetal bloodstream DNA sampling, amnio-
13
centesis, chorionic villus sampling or ‘‘CVS’’, and 
14
obstetric ultrasound. 
15
(7) Sex-selection abortions have the effect of di-
16
minishing the representation of women in the Amer-
17
ican population, and therefore, the American elec-
18
torate. 
19
(8) Sex-selection abortions reinforce sex dis-
20
crimination and have no place in a civilized society. 
21
(9) The history of the United States includes 
22
many examples of sex discrimination. The people of 
23
the United States ultimately responded in the 
24
strongest possible legal terms by enacting a constitu-
25
23:05 Jan 24, 2022
H6465
4 
•HR 6465 IH
tional amendment correcting an element of this dis-
1
crimination. Women, once subjected to sex discrimi-
2
nation that denied them the right to vote, now have 
3
suffrage guaranteed by the 19th Amendment. The 
4
elimination of discriminatory practices has been and 
5
is among the highest priorities and greatest achieve-
6
ments of American history. 
7
(10) Implicitly approving the discriminatory 
8
practices of sex-selection abortion by choosing not to 
9
prohibit them will reinforce sex discrimination, and 
10
coarsen society to the value of females. Thus, Con-
11
gress has a compelling interest in acting—indeed it 
12
must act—to prohibit sex-selection abortion. 
13
(b) CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY.—In accordance 
14
with the above findings, Congress enacts the following 
15
pursuant to Congress’ power under— 
16
(1) the Commerce Clause; 
17
(2) section 5 of the 14th Amendment, including 
18
the power to enforce the prohibition on government 
19
action denying equal protection of the laws; and 
20
(3) section 8 of article I to make all laws nec-
21
essary and proper for the carrying into execution of 
22
powers vested by the Constitution in the Govern-
23
ment of the United States.
