RESOLUTION 
Expressing condemnation for police brutality wherever in the 
world it occurs. 
Whereas, in 2020 and 2021, there have been significant 
peaceful assemblies protesting against police brutality 
throughout the world, including in the United States; 
Whereas police brutality may include human rights violations 
such as the use of excessive force, extrajudicial killings, 
arbitrary detention, torture, and the use of lethal rounds 
and the unnecessary use of ‘‘less-lethal’’ crowd control 
weapons by law enforcement, in response to peaceful as-
semblies;

Whereas police brutality may occur prior to an arrest, during 
crowd control operations, during an arrest, and while an 
individual is in custody; 
Whereas the Small Arms Survey identified that between 
2007–2012, 19,000 people worldwide were killed by po-
lice annually; 
Whereas a 2017 United Nations Development Program re-
port found that more than 70 percent of individuals who 
had joined violent extremist groups across Africa self-re-
ported that ‘‘government action’’, including police bru-
tality, was the determining factor in their decision to join 
such groups; 
Whereas the United States is the largest arms exporter in the 
world, including as the top provider to 13 out of 19 coun-
tries in the Middle East; 
Whereas the United States is the largest developer and ex-
porter of ‘‘less-lethal’’ weapons, including tear gas, in the 
world; 
Whereas the United States, especially under the auspices of 
the wars on drugs and global terrorism, has in recent 
decades dramatically increased its influence on the tac-
tics, equipment, and purpose of policing around the 
world; 
Whereas during that same period and under those same aus-
pices, domestic police forces at the State, local, and Fed-
eral level have become increasingly militarized in both 
equipment and tactics; 
Whereas several United States embassies in Africa released 
statements in the aftermath of the May 25, 2020, police 
killing of Minneapolis resident George Floyd, explicitly

recognizing the foreign policy dimension of domestic po-
lice violence; 
Whereas many of those statements included reminders of the 
importance of an impartial judicial system and account-
ability for state security forces who commit human rights 
violations; 
Whereas on a global scale, police brutality occurs on every 
continent, in both democracies and dictatorships, and in 
countries that are both partners and adversaries of the 
United States; 
Whereas on a global scale, police brutality disproportionately 
harms already vulnerable people, including racial, ethnic, 
and religious minorities, women, migrants, people with 
disabilities, and members of the LGBTQIA+ community; 
and 
Whereas on a global scale, impunity for both individual police 
officers and departments or units who commit police bru-
tality is an endemic problem: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
