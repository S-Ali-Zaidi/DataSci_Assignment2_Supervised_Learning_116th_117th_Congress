(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that— 
2
(1) as a result of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 
3
(COVID–19) pandemic, more than 40,000,000 peo-
4
ple in the United States have filed claims for unem-
5
ployment benefits since March 2020, which is a level 
6
of unemployment not seen since the Great Depres-
7
sion; 
8
(2) investments in fish, wildlife, and habitat 
9
restoration and outdoor recreation infrastructure 
10
generate as many as 33 jobs per $1,000,000 in-
11
vested, as demonstrated by the American Recovery 
12
and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111–5; 
13
123 Stat. 115); 
14
(3) the outdoor recreation economy— 
15
(A) generates $887,000,000,000 in eco-
16
nomic activity each year, which is 2.2 percent 
17
of the gross domestic product of the United 
18
States, according to the Bureau of Economic 
19
Analysis; and

(4) the demand for outdoor recreation has in-
1
creased dramatically during the Coronavirus Disease 
2
2019 (COVID–19) pandemic; 
3
(5) the Federal Government and State and local

governments and agencies have many ‘‘shovel-ready’’

projects and green infrastructure maintenance back-
6
log projects that would— 
7
(A) improve the quality of life and outdoor 
8
experiences of people of the United States; 
9
(B) make communities, especially commu-
10
nities that are traditionally underserved, more 
11
resilient to climate change, natural disasters, 
12
and wildfires; and 
13
(C) provide access to outdoor recreation 
14
opportunities to all people of the United States; 
15
(6) many facilities and natural resources lo-
16
cated on dedicated conservation land are in disrepair 
17

jobs in the conservation field; and 
5
(C) benefit the economy and environment 
6
of the United States; and

in place but need additional resources in order to

scale up the activities of the conservation corps to

meet growing deferred maintenance needs on public

land. 
12
(b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this Act are— 
13
(1) to employ, during the 5-year period begin-
14
ning on the date of enactment of this Act, a total 
15
of 1,000,000 people in the United States in dedi-
16
cated conservation land projects to support the 
17
growing backlog of deferred conservation land 
18
projects; 
19
(2) to expose Participants to public service 
20
while furthering the understanding and appreciation 
21
of the Participants of the natural and cultural re-
22
