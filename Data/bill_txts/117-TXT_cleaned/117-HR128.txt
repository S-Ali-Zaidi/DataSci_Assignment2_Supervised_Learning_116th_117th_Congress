RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the rise of cardiovascular disease as the world’s 
leading cause of preventable death and disability and 
as the global public health crisis of our generation and 
supporting the recognition of February 2021, as ‘‘Amer-
ican Heart Month’’. 
Whereas the World Health Organization estimates that in 
2017, 17,800,000 people died from cardiovascular dis-
eases (CVDs) globally; 
Whereas of these deaths, 85 percent were due to heart at-
tacks and strokes and over three-quarters of CVD deaths 
occur in low- and middle-income countries;

•HRES 128 IH 
Whereas CVDs result in tremendous health care costs and 
lost productivity and, if not addressed, the United States 
alone will spend over $1,000,000,000,000 by 2035 on 
costs relating to CVD; 
Whereas educational attainment, household income, residen-
tial environment, access to health care, and structural 
racism contribute significantly to disparities in CVD mor-
tality in the United States; 
Whereas the global COVID–19 pandemic poses significantly 
high risk to individuals with CVD and risk factors; 
Whereas the heavy burden of death and disability from CVDs 
can be decreased through changes in behavior linked to 
major risk factors, including reduced tobacco use and salt 
consumption and improvements in access to medical 
treatment and services; 
Whereas essential quality-assured medicines and technologies 
are critical components to address the global burden of 
CVDs; and 
Whereas United States leadership and support has strength-
ened surveillance, enhanced workforce capacity, and pro-
vided valuable technical exchanges in the area of CVD: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports recognition of American Heart 
2
Month to bring awareness to the cardiovascular dis-
3
ease (CVD) public health crisis in the United States
