Whereas children who live in poverty are often subject to 
other adverse circumstances including homelessness, in-
cluding 1,500,000 children in the 2017–2018 academic 
school year; 
Whereas children who live in poverty are often subject to 
other adverse circumstances including abuse; 
Whereas children who live in poverty can face long-term neg-
ative outcomes, including poverty as an adult and lifelong 
health consequences; 
Whereas lost productivity, worsened health, and increased 
crime stemming from child poverty cost the Nation about 
$700,000,000,000 dollars a year, or about 3.5 percent of 
GDP; 
Whereas the COVID–19 public health emergency has in-
creased the likelihood of child poverty; 
Whereas, since May 2020, the share of children with at least 
1 unemployed parent has consistently remained above 
rates reported during the peak of the Great Recession, 
with more than 4 in 10 children living in a household 
struggling to meet basic expenses; and 
Whereas recent studies suggest that food insecurity has in-
creased among families with children by 280 percent: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the designation of National Child 
2
Poverty Prevention Month; 
3
(2) recognizes the national impact of the preva-

lence of poverty among America’s children;
