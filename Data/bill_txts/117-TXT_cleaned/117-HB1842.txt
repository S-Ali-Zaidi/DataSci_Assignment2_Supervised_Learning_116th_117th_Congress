SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Harriet Tubman was a formerly enslaved 
3
abolitionist who guided about 70 people from slavery 
4
to freedom in 10 years. 
5
(2) Born in March 1822, Tubman was a nota-
6
ble abolitionist who not only freed herself, but also 
7
freed others from slavery. 
8
(3) Harriet Ross Tubman, born Araminta 
9
‘‘Minty’’ Ross, was born enslaved on the plantation 
10
of Anthony Thompson in Dorchester County, Mary-
11
land. 
12
(4) With the help of the Underground Railroad 
13
network, in the fall of 1849, Tubman escaped from 
14
Poplar Neck in Caroline County, Maryland, heading 
15
north to freedom in Pennsylvania. 
16
(5) With the passing of the Fugitive Slave Act 
17
as part of the Compromise of 1850, the operations 
18
to help enslaved persons escape became dangerous 
19
and she risked her life to rescue them from slavery. 
20
(6) Despite passage of the Compromise of 1850 
21
and the Fugitive Slave Act, Tubman continued her 
22
work, escorting her refugees to Canada instead. 
23
(7) It was during the 1850s that Tubman made 
24
13 trips back to Maryland, guiding approximately 70 
25
enslaved persons to the North, including family 
26

members, and providing instruction to about 70 
1
more who found their way to freedom on their own. 
2
(8) Regardless of the arduous process of help-
3
ing fugitive enslaved persons escape through the Un-
4
derground Railroad, not a single person was recap-
5
tured under Tubman’s supervision. 
6
(9) During 1859, Tubman aided abolitionist 
7
John Brown by recruiting supporters for his raid on 
8
Harper’s Ferry, a planned insurrection against 
9
slaveholders in Virginia and Maryland. 
10
(10) In the beginning of the Civil War, Tubman 
11
served as a spy, cook, and nurse in South Carolina 
12
and Florida. 
13
(11) Tubman also recruited newly freed Afri-
14
can-American men to join regiments of African- 
15
American soldiers called United States Colored 
16
Troops. 
17
(12) In recognition of her abilities, Tubman 
18
served as an army scout and spy for Major General 
19
David Hunter and Colonel James Montgomery. Har-
20
riet Tubman was inducted into the Military Intel-
21
ligence Corps Hall of Fame. 
22
(13) Tubman distinguished herself as the first 
23
woman to lead an armed expedition in the Civil War, 
24

•HR 1842 IH
the Combahee River Raid, resulting in more than 
1
700 enslaved persons in South Carolina being freed. 
2
(14) After the Civil War, Tubman frequently 
3
sheltered and fed newly freed enslaved persons at 
4
her home on South Street in Auburn, New York, 
5
which she purchased from Secretary of State Wil-
6
liam Henry Seward, even though she had little 
7
money herself. She found a means to an end by 
8
working as a domestic, selling produce from her gar-
9
den, taking in donations of food, loans from friends, 
10
and raising pigs on her farm. 
11
(15) Tubman became active in the women’s 
12
movement as early as 1860. She attended meetings 
13
and gave speeches in her home State of New York, 
14
as well as in Boston and Washington, D.C. 
15
(16) Tubman was an avid advocate for African- 
16
American women and their civil rights. In 1896, she 
17
was invited as a speaker at the first meeting of the 
18
National Association of Colored Women in Wash-
19
ington, D.C. 
20
(17) Although living in financial insecurity, 
21
Tubman transferred a 25-acre parcel of land to the 
22
African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church in 1903, 
23
which eventually became The Harriet Tubman 
24
Home for the Aged and Indigent Negroes. At the 
25

time, few social services existed for elderly and ill 
1
people of color. 
2
(18) Escaping slavery, risking everything to 
3
save her family and friends, aiding enslaved persons 
4
in escape from slavery, leading a military raid, 
5
championing the cause of women’s suffrage, advo-
6
cating for civil rights and access to health care, Har-
7
riet Tubman is an individual that has performed 
8
achievements that have had profound impacts on 
9
history and culture in the United States.
