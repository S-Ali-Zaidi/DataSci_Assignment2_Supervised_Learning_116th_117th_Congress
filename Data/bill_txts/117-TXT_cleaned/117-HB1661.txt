A BILL 
To support and expand civic engagement and political leader-
ship of adolescent girls around the world, and other 
purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Girls Leadership, En-
4
gagement, Agency, and Development Act of 2021’’ or the 
5
‘‘Girls LEAD Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
7
Congress makes the following findings: 
8
(1) Inclusive democracy and governance are 
9
fundamental objectives and critical foundations for 
10

•HR 1661 IH
sustainable development and global peace. Pro-
1
motion of democracy, human rights, and governance 
2
is a reflection of fundamental American values and 
3
identity. 
4
(2) Democracies score consistently higher than 
5
nondemocracies on a broad range of socioeconomic 
6
development indicators, including infant and child 
7
mortality, life expectancy, primary school enrollment, 
8
adult literacy, female youth literacy, female sec-
9
ondary school enrollment, and access to clean water. 
10
(3) Women’s political participation results in 
11
tangible gains for democracy, including greater re-
12
sponsiveness to citizen needs, increased cooperation 
13
across party and ethnic lines, and more sustainable 
14
peace, as emphasized in the Women, Peace, and Se-
15
curity Act (Public Law 115–68). 
16
(4) Women in leadership positions are more 
17
likely to resolve national crises without resorting to 
18
violence, sustain peace agreements over longer peri-
19
ods of time, advocate for social issues that benefit 
20
all, and allocate budgets to health and education. 
21
(5) Despite comprising over 50 percent of the 
22
world’s population, women are underrepresented at 
23
all levels of public sector decision making. At the 
24

•HR 1661 IH
current rate of progress, it will take over 100 years 
1
to achieve gender parity in political participation. 
2
(6) Engaging adolescent girls more in civil and 
3
political activities contributes to increased political 
4
participation and women’s leadership around the 
5
world over time. Adolescents who participate actively 
6
in their community from early on are more likely to 
7
become engaged citizens and voters, with higher lev-
8
els of ambition for future leadership positions in 
9
both politics and the private sector. Their safe, 
10
meaningful, and appropriate participation is key to 
11
creating democratic societies with informed and en-
12
gaged citizens. 
13
(7) Adolescence is a critical period in a girl’s 
14
life, when significant physical, emotional, and social 
15
changes shape her future. Adolescent girls are par-
16
ticularly vulnerable to HIV/AIDS and other STDs 
17
and STIs, child, early, and forced marriage, and 
18
other forms of gender-based violence, including traf-
19
ficking in persons and sexual exploitation, harass-
20
ment, and assault, which are detrimental to their fu-
21
tures. 
22
(8) School closures related to the COVID–19 
23
pandemic have pushed nearly 743,000,000 girls 
24
around the world out of school, on top of the ap-
25
21:08 May 05, 2021
H1661
4 
•HR 1661 IH
proximately 132,000,000 girls between the ages of 6 
1
and 17 already out of school. 
2
(9) The economic impacts of the COVID–19 
3
crisis are projected to put an additional 2,500,000 
4
girls at risk of child marriage between 2020 and 
5
2025, in addition to the 12,000,000 adolescent girls 
6
under 18 who will marry annually. The number one 
7
cause of death for adolescent girls 15 to 19 years old 
8
is childbirth, and 90 percent of births to adolescent 
9
girls 15 to 19 occur within a marriage. 
10
(10) Every 10 minutes, somewhere in the 
11
world, an adolescent girl dies as a result of violence. 
12
A girl’s risk of dying as a result of violence increases 
13
from early to late adolescence. Violence is the second 
14
leading cause of death among adolescent girls glob-
15
ally. Girls with disabilities may face up to 10 times 
16
more violence than girls without disabilities. 
17
(11) Empowering adolescent girls and young 
18
women in childhood and as they transition to become 
19
adults, investing in their leadership potential, and 
20
ensuring there are established pathways to positions 
21
of political leadership and civic engagement con-
22
tribute to ensuring a world where women can thrive 
23
as political leaders and decision makers, in economic 
24
spaces and across society as a whole.
