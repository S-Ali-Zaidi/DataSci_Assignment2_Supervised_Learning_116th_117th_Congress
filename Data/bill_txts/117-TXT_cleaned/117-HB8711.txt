(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following find-
2
ings: 
3
(1) The United States and Ecuador have a his-
4
tory of bilateral cooperation grounded in mutual re-
5
spect, shared democratic values, and mutual security 
6
interests. 
7
(2) On February 7, 2021, and April 11, 2021, 
8
Ecuador held democratic elections that included par-
9
ties from across the political spectrum, paving the 
10
way for continued progress towards strengthening 
11
democratic institutions. 
12
(3) The United States and Ecuador share stra-
13
tegic interests in strengthening Ecuador’s demo-
14
cratic institutions, generating inclusive economic 
15
growth, and building capacity in law enforcement, 
16
anti-corruption, and conservation efforts. 
17
(4) The United States and Ecuador historically 
18
have enjoyed strong commercial, investment, and 
19
economic ties, yet Ecuador continues to face signifi-

cant challenges to inclusive economic development, 
1
including— 
2
(A) the heavy economic toll of the COVID– 
3
19 pandemic; 
4
(B) vulnerabilities with respect to the 
5
growing role of the People’s Republic of China 
6
in the financing and refinancing of Ecuador’s 
7
debts, and in strategic infrastructure projects 
8
and sectors of the Ecuadorian economy; and 
9
(C) the need to develop and strengthen 
10
open and transparent economic policies that 
11
strengthen Ecuador’s integration with global 
12
markets, inclusive economic growth, and oppor-
13
tunities for upward social mobility for the Ec-
14
uadorian people. 
15
(5) Since its establishment in December 2019, 
16
the United States Development Finance Corporation 
17
has provided more than $440,000,000 in financing 
18
to Ecuador. 
19
(6) Ecuador’s justice system has taken impor-
20
tant steps to fight corruption and criminality and to 
21
increase accountability. However, enduring chal-
22
lenges to the rule of law in Ecuador, including the 
23
activities of transnational criminal organizations, il-
24

1
going risks for political and social stability in Ecua-

(7) The activities undertaken by the Govern-
4
ment of the People’s Republic of China in Ecuador, 
5
including its development of the ECU–911 video 
6
surveillance and facial recognition system, financing 
7
of the corruptly managed and environmentally dele-
8
terious Coca Codo Sinclair Dam, and support for il-
9
legal, unreported, and unregulated fishing practices 
10
around the Galapagos Islands, pose risks to demo-
11
cratic governance and biodiversity in the country. 
12
(8) Ecuador, which is home to several of the 
13
Earth’s most biodiverse ecosystems, including the 
14
Galapagos Islands, the headwaters of the Amazon 
15
river, the Condor mountain range, and the Yasuni 
16
Biosphere Reserve, has seen a reduction in its 
17
rainforests between 1990 and 2016, due in part to 
18
the incursion of criminal networks into protected 
19
areas. 
20
(9) On March 24, 2021, the Senate unani-
21
mously approved Senate Resolution 22 (117th Con-
