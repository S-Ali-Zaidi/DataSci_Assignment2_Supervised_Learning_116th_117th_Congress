Whereas a land acknowledgment is a practice that honors 
and respects contemporary indigenous peoples’ connection 
to their ancestral lands; 
Whereas a land acknowledgment is an expression of gratitude 
and appreciation to Tribes who first resided in this coun-
try; 
Whereas a land acknowledgment serves as a reminder and a 
reflection on the impacts of colonialism, past and present; 
Whereas a land acknowledgment recognizes indigenous peo-
ples’ voices that have been devalued in past contexts; 
Whereas a land acknowledgment is a way to show both grati-
tude and appreciation for those who were first on the 
land and encourages a broadening of awareness of indige-
nous peoples; and 
Whereas it is encouraged that formal land acknowledgments 
be performed at introductions of public and ceremonial 
events: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) honors the legacy of indigenous peoples who 
2
inhabited the land before the establishment of the

6
tions to the United States; and 
7
(2) calls on State and local governments to en-
8
