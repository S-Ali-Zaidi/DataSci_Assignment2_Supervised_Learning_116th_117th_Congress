Whereas the River of Grass is essential for the environment, 
providing freshwater to nearly 10,000,000 Floridians and 
protection against hurricanes and floods; 
Whereas Everglades National Park, the third-largest national 
park in the lower 48 States, attracts more than 
1,000,000 annual visitors who enjoy kayaking hundreds 
of miles of water trails, biking through pine rocklands, 
and world-class fishing; 
Whereas a healthy ecosystem is dependent upon reversing the 
unintended consequences of past changes to the waters 
and habitats of the Everglades; 
Whereas a unique Federal and State intergovernmental part-
nership is working to restore the Everglades ecosystem 
along with an army of dedicated people in nonprofits and 
environmental advocacy groups who care about this vi-
brant national treasure and are seeing through that it 
will be passed along to future generations; 
Whereas recent years of historic Federal investment in Ever-
glades restoration has led to unprecedented momentum in 
advancing vital projects, including the Everglades Agri-
cultural Area Reservoir; and

it is ours to destroy or preserve, this the kingdom of 
otter, kingfisher, alligator, heron’’: Now, therefore, be it
