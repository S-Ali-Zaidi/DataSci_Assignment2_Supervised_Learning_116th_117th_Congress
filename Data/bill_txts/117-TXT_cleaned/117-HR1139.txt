RESOLUTION 
Commemorating the 30th anniversary of the establishment 
of the VetFran program at the International Franchise 
Association and IFA Foundation. 
Whereas the VetFran program was established in 1991 with 
the vision of serving veterans returning from the Gulf 
war; 
Whereas VetFran is a strategic initiative of the International 
Franchise Association and the IFA Foundation; 
Whereas the mission of VetFran is to educate both veterans 
and franchisors about the unique match between the 
skills and aptitude of entrepreneurial veterans and the 
demands and opportunities of being a franchisee;

Whereas VetFran works to facilitate the transition of vet-
erans into franchising by encouraging franchisors to offer 
discounts and incentives to veterans on the one hand, and 
to assemble resources, tools and a database of franchising 
opportunities for veterans on the other; 
Whereas the VetFran program is led by a dedicated com-
mittee of volunteers from the franchising industry, com-
posed of chief executive officers, senior franchise execu-
tives, and multi-unit franchisees, the members of the 
committee bring unparalleled experience and insight to 
the program; 
Whereas many of the committee members are veterans them-
selves and all of them volunteer their time and expertise 
because they share a deep commitment to the veterans 
community and have a passionate belief in the opportuni-
ties and prosperity that the franchise business model cre-
ates; 
Whereas franchising is one of America’s most enduring con-
tributions to the world of business; 
Whereas the franchise business model allows individuals to go 
into business for themselves, but not by themselves; 
Whereas veterans emerge from service with strong leadership 
skills and a thorough understanding of teams; 
Whereas military experience includes leading and motivating 
people, improving processes, and accomplishing a defined 
mission; and 
Whereas, like the military, successful franchisees, and em-
ployees accomplish the mission with a team: Now, there-
fore, be it
