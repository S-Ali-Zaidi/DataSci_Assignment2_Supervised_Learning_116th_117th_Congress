24
move, upgrade, enhance environmental performance, or 
25
00:12 Jul 31, 2021

45 
•HR 4375 IH
retrofit for hydropower production. The assessment is in-

19
(A) dams that continue to serve vital roles 
20
and may be priorities for upgrades, environ-
21
mental performance enhancements, or retrofits 
22
to add or replace generation at powered and 
23
non-powered facilities; and

12
ard classifications, condition assessment, envi-
13
ronmental improvement opportunities, climate 
14
change risks, known functions and other factors 
15
determined by the Lead agencies to meet the
