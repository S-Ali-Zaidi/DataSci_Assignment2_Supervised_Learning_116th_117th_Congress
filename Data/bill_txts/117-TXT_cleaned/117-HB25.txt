SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS. 
1
(a) FINDINGS
RELATING
TO
FEDERAL
INCOME 
2
TAX.—Congress finds the Federal income tax— 
3
(1) retards economic growth and has reduced 
4
the standard of living of the American public; 
5
(2) impedes the international competitiveness of 
6
United States industry; 
7
(3) reduces savings and investment in the 
8
United States by taxing income multiple times; 
9
(4) slows the capital formation necessary for 
10
real wages to steadily increase; 
11
(5) lowers productivity; 
12
23:15 Jan 22, 2021
H25
3 
•HR 25 IH
(6) imposes unacceptable and unnecessary ad-
1
ministrative and compliance costs on individual and 
2
business taxpayers; 
3
(7) is unfair and inequitable; 
4
(8) unnecessarily intrudes upon the privacy and 
5
civil rights of United States citizens; 
6
(9) hides the true cost of government by embed-
7
ding taxes in the costs of everything Americans buy; 
8
(10) is not being complied with at satisfactory 
9
levels and therefore raises the tax burden on law 
10
abiding citizens; and 
11
(11) impedes upward social mobility. 
12
(b) FINDINGS RELATING
TO FEDERAL PAYROLL 
13
TAXES.—Congress finds further that the Social Security 
14
and Medicare payroll taxes and self-employment taxes— 
15
(1) raise the cost of employment; 
16
(2) destroy jobs and cause unemployment; and 
17
(3) have a disproportionately adverse impact on 
18
lower income Americans. 
19
(c) FINDINGS RELATING TO FEDERAL ESTATE AND 
20
GIFT TAXES.—Congress finds further that the Federal es-
21
tate and gift taxes— 
22
(1) force family businesses and farms to be sold 
23
by the family to pay such taxes; 
24
23:15 Jan 22, 2021
H25
4 
•HR 25 IH
(2) discourage capital formation and entrepre-
1
neurship; 
2
(3) foster the continued dominance of large en-
3
terprises over small family-owned companies and 
4
farms; and 
5
(4) impose unacceptably high tax planning costs 
6
on small businesses and farms. 
7
(d) FINDINGS
RELATING
TO
NATIONAL
SALES 
8
TAX.—Congress finds further that a broad-based national 
9
sales tax on goods and services purchased for final con-
10
sumption— 
11
(1) is similar in many respects to the sales and 
12
use taxes in place in 45 of the 50 States; 
13
(2) will promote savings and investment; 
14
(3) will promote fairness; 
15
(4) will promote economic growth; 
16
(5) will raise the standard of living; 
17
(6) will increase investment; 
18
(7) will enhance productivity and international 
19
competitiveness; 
20
(8) will reduce administrative burdens on the 
21
American taxpayer; 
22
(9) will improve upward social mobility; and 
23
(10) will respect the privacy interests and civil 
24
rights of taxpayers.

•HR 25 IH
(e) FINDINGS RELATING TO ADMINISTRATION OF 
1
NATIONAL SALES TAX.—Congress further finds that— 
2
(1) most of the practical experience admin-
3
istering sales taxes is found at the State govern-
4
mental level; 
5
(2) it is desirable to harmonize Federal and 
6
State collection and enforcement efforts to the max-
7
imum extent possible; 
8
(3) it is sound tax administration policy to fos-
9
ter administration and collection of the Federal sales 
10
tax at the State level in return for a reasonable ad-
11
ministration fee to the States; and 
12
(4) businesses that must collect and remit taxes 
13
should receive reasonable compensation for the cost 
14
of doing so. 
15
(f) FINDINGS RELATING TO REPEAL OF PRESENT 
16
FEDERAL TAX SYSTEM.—Congress further finds that the 
17
16th Amendment to the United States Constitution should 
18
be repealed.
