A BILL 
To establish reasonable controls on firearms manufacturers 
and importers, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Firearm Industry 
4
Crime and Trafficking Accountability Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
The Congress finds as follows: 
7
(1) The firearm industry has engaged in dan-
8
gerous business practices, flooding American com-
9
munities with weapons of war like AR–15s and other 
10

•HR 8740 IH
semiautomatic weapons. Despite these practices, the 
1
firearm industry is not required to monitor its dis-
2
tribution to ensure that its products are not used for 
3
unlawful purposes. 
4
(2) A study conducted by the Bureau of Alco-
5
hol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) found 
6
that 5 percent of licensed dealers sell about 90 per-
7
cent of guns used in crimes (also known as ‘‘crime 
8
guns’’). Firearm manufacturers, through trace data 
9
provided by the ATF, often know exactly which deal-
10
ers and distributors disproportionately sell these 
11
crime guns. 
12
(3) Despite these indicators of diversion, fire-
13
arm manufacturers have failed to adequately curtail 
14
their distribution practices and sought to evade any 
15
responsibility for preventing the widespread misuse 
16
of their products—rejecting ATF resources and fail-
17
ing to effect change at the top of the distribution 
18
pyramid. 
19
(4) Firearm manufacturers also sell dangerous 
20
firearms to distributors and retailers who, according 
21
to ATF data, can fail to comply with Federal fire-
22
arms law. The trace analysis of 2,000 firearms deal-
23
ers cited by the ATF found that half of the dealers 
24
sold firearms to customers without conducting the 
25
02:16 Aug 25, 2022
H8740
3 
•HR 8740 IH
background checks required by Federal law. Fire-
1
arms dealers often flouted Federal laws and regula-
2
tions, sold weapons to convicted felons and domestic 
3
abusers, lied to investigators, and falsified records. 
4
SEC. 3. REQUIREMENT TO CREATE REASONABLE CON-
5
TROLS AND MONITORING SYSTEM. 
6
Each manufacturer or importer of firearms in or af-
7
fecting interstate commerce shall implement reasonable 
8
controls to prevent, and create and maintain a monitoring 
9
database to retain essential facts concerning, the criminal 
10
diversion or potential misuse of their products. 
11
SEC. 4. PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES. 
12
It shall be unlawful for any manufacturer or importer 
13
of firearms in or affecting interstate commerce to— 
14
(1) supply a firearm to a distributor or retailer 
15
of the firearm, knowing or having reasonable cause 
16
to believe that the distributor or retailer has failed 
17
to implement reasonable controls or engaged in dis-
18
tribution, sales, or other practices likely to result in 
19
a high risk of criminal diversion or misuse; 
20
(2) fail to investigate or inquire as to the dis-
21
tribution practices of such a distributor or retailer, 
22
knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that 
23
the distributor or retailer has failed to implement 
24
reasonable controls or engaged in distribution, sales,

or other practices likely to result in a high risk of 
1
criminal diversion or misuse; or 
2
(3) supply a quantity of firearms to a State or 
3
distribution area, knowing or having reasonable 
4
cause to believe that the quantity exceeds the lawful 
5
demand for firearms in the State or distribution 
6
area. 
7
SEC. 5. REQUIRED ACTIVITIES. 
8
Each manufacturer or importer of firearms in or af-
9
fecting interstate commerce shall— 
10
(1) report to the Director on any pattern, dis-
11
tribution, or repeated instances of a distributor or 
12
retailer of a firearm whom the firearm manufacturer 
13
or importer knows or has reasonable cause to believe 
14
has failed to implement reasonable controls or en-
15
gaged in distribution, sales, or other practices likely 
16
to result in a high risk of criminal diversion or mis-
17
use; 
18
(2) report to the Director annually, in such 
19
form and manner as the Director shall prescribe, all 
20
instances of criminal diversion or misuse of a prod-
21
uct distributed or sold by the manufacturer or im-
22
porter, as the case may be, of which the manufac-
23
turer or importer, as the case may be, is aware, and

4
information pertaining to the monitoring database of 
5
the manufacturer or importer, as the case may be.
