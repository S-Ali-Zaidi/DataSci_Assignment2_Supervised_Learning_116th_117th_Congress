SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Stealthing is a type of sexual violence used 
3
to describe non-consensual condom removal during 
4
sex. 
5
(2) In October 2021, California became the 
6
first State to outlaw stealthing at the State level. 
7
This law creates a civil remedy so that victims of 
8
stealthing can sue for damages. 
9
(3) A 2019 study from Health Psychology re-
10
ported that almost 10 percent of male participants 
11
reported engaging in non-consensual condom re-
12
moval since the age of 14 years, with an average of 
13
3.62 times and a range of 1–21 times. 
14
(4) A 2019 study from the Jacobs Institute of 
15
Women’s Health found that 12 percent of women 
16
have experienced stealthing. 
17
(5) A 2018 Australian study from PLoS ONE 
18
found that one in three female respondents and one 
19
in five gay male respondents have experienced 
20
stealthing. 
21
(6) Stealthing is a grave violation of autonomy, 
22
dignity, and trust that is considered emotional and 
23
sexual abuse.
