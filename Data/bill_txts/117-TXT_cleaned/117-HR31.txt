RESOLUTION 
Condemning and censuring Representative Mo Brooks of 
Alabama. 
Whereas, on January 6, 2021, Representative Mo Brooks ad-
dressed a rally in Washington, DC, attended by numer-
ous members of known extremist and antigovernment 
groups, including the Proud Boys, QAnon, Boogaloo 
Boys, and Oathkeepers, who would shortly thereafter 
march to seize the United States Capitol; 
Whereas participants in the rally and march openly boasted 
on public social media sites well in advance that they in-
tended to storm the Capitol to forcibly stop the certifi-
cation of the Presidential election, often referring to Jan-
uary 6 as the day when the ‘‘final battle’’ in a ‘‘revolu-
tion’’ or ‘‘cleansing’’ would occur, threatening violence

against members of Congress, and promising to give their 
lives if necessary in the fight; 
Whereas Representative Brooks said to participants in the 
rally, ‘‘Today is a time of choosing and tomorrow is a 
time of fighting. Today is also a day of revelation and 
separation . . . Today, by their votes, Americans will 
learn which Republican congressmen and senators love 
their bourbon, love their cigars, love their prestige, love 
their personal power, love their special interest group 
money more than they love America.’’; 
Whereas Representative Brooks then exhorted the audience, 
‘‘Today is the day American patriots start taking down 
names and kicking ass’’; 
Whereas participants in the rally then proceeded to march to 
the United States Capitol, which they forcibly and unlaw-
fully entered, many armed with metal rods, bats, and 
firearms, hoisting Confederate battle flags, assaulting po-
lice officers, leading to the murder of United States Cap-
itol Police Officer Brian Sicknick and four other deaths, 
dozens of injuries, and causing physical damage to 
United States Capitol property; 
Whereas Representative Brooks’ speech on January 6 encour-
aged and incited violence against his fellow Members of 
Congress, as part of an assault on the United States 
Capitol intended to prevent the House of Representatives 
and the Senate from discharging their Constitutional du-
ties to count Electoral College votes; 
Whereas after inciting these acts of insurrection that resulted 
in injuries and loss of life, Representative Brooks has 
shown no remorse or regret for his comments, instead

stating, ‘‘I make no apology for doing my absolute best 
to inspire patriotic Americans’’; and 
Whereas Representative Brooks’ actions encouraged and 
fueled the mob, brought shame on the House of Rep-
resentatives, jeopardizing its reputation and institutional 
integrity, as well as the safety of its Members and staff: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That— 
1
(1) Representative Mo Brooks of Alabama be

censured;

(2) Representative Mo Brooks forthwith present

himself in the well of the House of Representatives

the public reading of this resolution by the Speaker.
