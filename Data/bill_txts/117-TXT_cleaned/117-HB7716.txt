Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Coordinating Sub-
4
stance Use and Homelessness Care Act of 2022’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) The United States has a homelessness cri-
8
sis, with more than 580,000 people experiencing 
9
homelessness on a single night according to the De-
10
partment of Housing and Urban Development’s 
11
2020 Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Con-
12
gress. 
13
(2) While the lack of affordable housing is the 
14
primary driver of homelessness, behavioral health 
15
conditions, including substance use disorders, can 
16
exacerbate homelessness and can also be a con-
17
sequence of homelessness. 
18
(3) Research shows that people experiencing 
19
homelessness have higher rates of substance use dis-
20
order than people with housing stability. Some peo-
21
ple who experience homelessness use substances to 
22
cope with the trauma and deprivations of their cir-
23
cumstances, but substance use disorders frequently

•HR 7716 IH
make it more difficult for people experiencing home-
1
lessness to secure permanent housing. 
2
(4) Many individuals with substance use dis-
3
order who experience homelessness have co-occurring 
4
illnesses. The combined effect of physical illness, 
5
mental illness, and lack of housing results in higher 
6
mortality rates for individuals experiencing home-
7
lessness. 
8
(5) Safely and securely housing individuals who 
9
are experiencing both homelessness and behavioral 
10
health issues, including substance use disorders, 
11
often requires supportive services and close coordina-
12
tion between housing and social service providers, in 
13
addition to low-barrier, affordable housing. Sub-
14
sidized housing is critical, but not enough—access to 
15
additional voluntary person-centered supportive serv-
16
ices is needed. 
17
(6) Nevertheless, it is imperative that when 
18
people experiencing homelessness, including those 
19
with a behavioral health condition such as substance 
20
use disorder, choose to seek help that housing as 
21
well as health care and person-centered supportive 
22
services be coordinated, particularly given their 
23
acute needs and the significant costs incurred by 
24

•HR 7716 IH
communities for law enforcement, correctional, and 
1
emergency department care for failing to do so. 
2
(7) Providing access to health care and vol-
3
untary person-centered supportive services can be 
4
beneficial in securing and successfully maintaining 
5
stable housing. 
6
(8) Integration of health and homelessness serv-
7
ices to achieve optimal outcomes for people experi-
8
encing homelessness, significant behavioral health 
9
conditions such as substance use disorder, and other 
10
health conditions can be challenging for State and 
11
local governments, continuums of care, and commu-
12
nity-based organizations that administer both health 
13
and homelessness services and providers of homeless-
14
ness services. 
15
(9) Capacity-building is needed to create sys-
16
tems-level linkages between the two sets of services 
17
to allow for smoother pathways and simpler naviga-
18
tion. 
19
(10) Black, Hispanic, and Indigenous people 
20
are disproportionately underserved by person-cen-
21
tered supportive services. In order to address critical 
22
services deficits and affirmatively serve protected 
23
classes of people with significant behavioral health 
24
conditions, including substance use disorders, who 
25
23:25 May 12, 2022

•HR 7716 IH
are experiencing homelessness, the grant program 
1
established under this Act can be used to build the 
2
capacities of homelessness services providers that 
3
have demonstrated cultural competencies in service 
4
provision and a record of serving Black, Hispanic, 
5
and Indigenous people and other underserved popu-
6
lations experiencing homelessness that also suffer 
7
from substance use disorders.
