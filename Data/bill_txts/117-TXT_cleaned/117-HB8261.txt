A BILL 
To prohibit unfair and deceptive advertising of rates for 
hotel rooms and other places of short-term lodging. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Hotel Advertising 
4
Transparency Act of 2022’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress makes the following findings: 
7
(1) As of the day before the date of the enact-
8
ment of this Act, hotel rooms, short-term rentals, 
9
and other places of lodging are often advertised at 
10

•HR 8261 IH
a rate and later in the buying process mandatory 
1
fees are disclosed that were not included in the ad-
2
vertised room rate. 
3
(2) The mandatory fees described in paragraph 
4
(1) are sometimes called by names such as ‘‘resort 
5
fees’’, ‘‘cleaning fees’’, or ‘‘facility fees’’ and they are 
6
all mandatory and charged by a place of short-term 
7
lodging in addition to advertised room rates. 
8
(3) The number of short-term lodging facilities 
9
that charge mandatory resort fees is growing. 
10
(4) Advertising that does not reflect the true 
11
mandatory cost of a stay at a place of short-term 
12
lodging is deceptive. 
13
(5) The Federal Trade Commission has author-
14
ity under section 5 of the Federal Trade Commis-
15
sion Act (15 U.S.C. 45) to regulate and prohibit un-
16
fair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting 
17
commerce. 
18
(6) In 2012 and 2013, the Federal Trade Com-
19
mission exercised its authority under such section 5 
20
to issue warning letters to 35 hotel operators and 11 
21
online travel agents. In those letters, the Commis-
22
sion cautioned hotel operators and online travel 
23
agents that mandatory resort fees could confuse con-
24

sumers in violation of section 5(a) of such Act (15 
1
U.S.C. 45(a)). 
2
(7) In 2017, an economist at the Federal Trade 
3
Commission published an issue paper that found 
4
that forcing consumers to click through additional 
5
webpages to see a hotel’s resort fee increases the 
6
time spent searching and learning the hotel’s price, 
7
and went on to state the following: ‘‘Separating the 
8
room rate from the resort fee increases the cognitive 
9
costs of remembering the hotel’s price. When it be-
10
comes more costly to search and evaluate an addi-
11
tional hotel, a consumer’s choice is either to incur 
12
higher total search and cognitive costs or to make an 
13
incomplete, less informed decision that may result in 
14
a more costly room, or both.’’.
