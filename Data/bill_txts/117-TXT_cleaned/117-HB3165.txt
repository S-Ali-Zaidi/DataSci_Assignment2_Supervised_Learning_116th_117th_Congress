SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS; FINDINGS.

(a) SHORT TITLE.—This Act may be cited as the 
4
‘‘Nurse Staffing Standards for Hospital Patient Safety 
5
and Quality Care Act of 2021’’.

(b) TABLE OF CONTENTS.—The table of contents for 
1
this Act is as follows: 
2
Sec. 1. Short title; table of contents; findings. 
Sec. 2. Minimum direct care registered nurse staffing requirement. 
Sec. 3. Enforcement of requirements through Federal programs. 
Sec. 4. Nurse workforce initiative. 
(c) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
3
(1) The Federal Government has a substantial 
4
interest in promoting quality care and improving the 
5
delivery of health care services to patients in health 
6
care facilities in the United States. 
7
(2) Recent changes in health care delivery sys-
8
tems that have resulted in higher acuity levels 
9
among patients in health care facilities increase the 
10
need for improved quality measures in order to pro-
11
tect patient care and reduce the incidence of medical 
12
errors. 
13
(3) Inadequate and poorly monitored registered 
14
nurse staffing practices that result in too few reg-
15
istered nurses providing direct care jeopardize the 
16
delivery of quality health care services. 
17
(4) Numerous studies have shown that patient 
18
outcomes are directly correlated to direct care reg-
19
istered nurse staffing levels, including a 2010 
20
Health Services Research study that concluded that 
21
implementation of minimum nurse-to-patient staff-
22
ing ratios in California has led to improved patient

outcomes and nurse retention and a 2014 Agency 
1
for Healthcare Research and Quality study that con-
2
cluded increases in nurse staffing and skill mix lead 
3
to improved quality and reduced length of stay at no 
4
additional cost. 
5
(5) Requirements for direct care registered 
6
nurse staffing ratios will help address the registered 
7
nurse shortage in the United States by aiding in re-
8
cruitment of new registered nurses and improving 
9
retention of registered nurses who are considering 
10
leaving direct patient care because of demands cre-
11
ated by inadequate staffing. 
12
(6) Establishing adequate minimum direct care 
13
registered nurse-to-patient ratios that take into ac-
14
count patient acuity measures will improve the deliv-
15
ery of quality health care services and guarantee pa-
16
tient safety. 
17
(7) Establishing safe staffing standards for di-
18
rect care registered nurses is a critical component of 
19
assuring that there is adequate hospital staffing at 
20
all levels to improve the delivery of quality care and 
21
protect patient safety.
