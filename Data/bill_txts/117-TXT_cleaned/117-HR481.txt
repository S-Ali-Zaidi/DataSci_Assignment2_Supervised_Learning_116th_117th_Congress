RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for health and wellness coaches. 
Whereas lifestyle-related chronic diseases are at the heart of 
the current health care crisis in the United States; 
Whereas the United States Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention has deemed chronic disease ‘‘the public health 
challenge of the 21st century’’; 
Whereas decades of research have linked lifestyle factors, 
such as inactivity, poor diet, tobacco smoking, and sus-
tained stress, with increased risk for major illnesses and 
death; 
Whereas attempts to reduce these lifestyle-related chronic dis-
eases and costs have proven to be financially unsustain-
able within a system that rewards hospitalizations and 
invasive procedures;

Whereas incentives for interventions and technologies that 
achieve desired outcomes such as outpatient care, risk 
management, patient support, and health coaching should 
be encouraged; 
Whereas a large gap exists between health care provider rec-
ommendations and sustainable health-related behavior 
change; 
Whereas health coaches are a new type of health care worker 
who serve as wellness guides and supportive mentors that 
motivate individuals to cultivate positive health choices 
and move them toward those specific goals; 
Whereas health coaches serve a vital role in improving an in-
dividual’s wellness that complements and does not replace 
the work of health care professionals; and 
Whereas there are an increasing number of studies that show 
the effectiveness of health and wellness coaches in im-
proving individual health and wellness and reducing 
health care costs: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives supports 
1
the efforts of health and wellness coaches of the United 
2
States on their important work to improve the health and 
3
wellness of the Nation.
