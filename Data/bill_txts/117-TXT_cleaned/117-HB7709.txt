16
human rights experts, the Taliban is currently insti-
17
tutionalizing large-scaled systematic gender-based 
18
discrimination against Afghan women and girls.

20
secondary and tertiary education based on their gen-
21
der.

2
(6) The United States and the international 
3
community have expressed concern about Afghan 
4
women and girls, their rights to education, work, 
5
and freedom of movement, and called on those in po-
6
sitions of power and authority across Afghanistan to 
7
guarantee their protection. 
8
(7) The United States and the international 
9
community have affirmed that ‘‘Afghan women and 
10
girls, as all Afghan people, deserve to live in safety, 
11
security and dignity’’.

18
economic status, ethnicity, or religion should have

the opportunity to pursue an education without fear 
20
of discrimination.
