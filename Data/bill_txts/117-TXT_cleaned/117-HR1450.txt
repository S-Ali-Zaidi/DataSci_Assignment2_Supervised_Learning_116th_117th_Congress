RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the recognition of October 30, 2022, 
as the International Day of Political Prisoners. 
Whereas the number of political prisoners across the world, 
including cases of journalists, academics, peace and polit-
ical activists, political oppositionists and dissidents, and 
human rights defenders being detained, arrested, con-
victed, and otherwise punished for political motives with-
out connection to any credible offence has steadily in-
creased; 
Whereas the United States Government estimates that there 
are more than 1 million political prisoners worldwide; 
Whereas authoritarian and repressive regimes around the 
world have engaged in systematic destruction of inde-
pendent voices, including but not limited to the Russian 
and Belarusian Governments;

Whereas national governments and legislative bodies have an 
obligation to raise awareness about the plight of political 
prisoners; 
Whereas national governments and legislative bodies should 
advocate with states holding political prisoners their 
prompt release; 
Whereas, on October 30, 1974, Soviet human rights activists 
and dissidents initiated the idea of marking the day of 
political prisoners in the USSR and consequently held a 
hunger strike that day while in jail; 
Whereas, in 1978, the Moscow Helsinki Group—founded in 
1976, disbanded in 1982 due to KGB intimidation, and 
reestablished by former USSR political prisoners and 
human rights activists in 1989—declared October 30 Po-
litical Prisoner Day; and 
Whereas October 30, 1991, marked the first annual Remem-
brance Day for the Victims of Political Repression ob-
served in Russia: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) deplores all forms of political repression and

imprisonment;

Government condemning political imprisonment and
