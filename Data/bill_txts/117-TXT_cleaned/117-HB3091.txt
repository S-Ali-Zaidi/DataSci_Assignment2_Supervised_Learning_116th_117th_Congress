•HR 3091 IH
(1) Court rulings have affirmed the Cherokee 
1
Nation and the Chickasaw Nation have reservations 
2
that constitute Indian country for purposes of crimi-
3
nal jurisdiction, the boundaries of which are set 
4
forth in each Nation’s respective treaties with the 
5
United States. 
6
(2) Each Nation has worked with the State, in-
7
cluding certain political subdivisions of the State, to 
8
ensure cooperation and coordination on law enforce-
9
ment and public safety within the respective reserva-
10
tions of the Nations. 
11
(3) Legally effective compacts are important 
12
tools of Tribal self-determination and are useful in 
13
avoiding jurisdictional disputes within Indian coun-
14
try; 
15
(4) The Nations and the State have successfully 
16
implemented intergovernmental agreements on polic-
17
ing, taxation, child welfare, gaming, hunting and 
18
fishing, and other matters implicating their respec-
19
tive sovereign authorities, rights, and interests. 
20
(5) Sections 1152 and 1153 of title 18, United 
21
States Code, and other Federal laws preempt the 
22
Nations and the State from forming effective com-
23
pacts respecting criminal jurisdiction in Indian coun-
24
try.
