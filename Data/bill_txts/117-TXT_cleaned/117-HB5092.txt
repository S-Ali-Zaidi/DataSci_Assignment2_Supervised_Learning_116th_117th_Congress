A BILL 
To prohibit the Federal Government from requiring any cit-
izen to be vaccinated, including Federal agencies from 
requiring its employees to take any vaccination, without 
the citizen being fully advised in writing of all known 
potential risks from the vaccine and consultation with 
a physician followed by the voluntary informed consent 
of the citizen, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
1
It is the sense of Congress that: 
2
(1) The Constitution does not permit a vaccine 
3
mandate, including a mandate by the executive 
4
branch imposed on Federal employees as a condition 
5
to maintain the employment they need to feed their 
6
families. 
7
(2) It is unconscionable for any entity to use 
8
force or coercion to compel individuals to take a vac-
9
cine, and even more egregiously unconscionable for 
10
a vaccine to be administered under emergency use 
11
authorization (EUA) without adequate warnings of 
12
known potential risks. 
13
(3) Mandating vaccines, including experimental 
14
vaccines, does not fall within any of the executive 
15
authorities, according to article II, section 2 of the 
16
United States Constitution. 
17
(4) The Constitution reserves ‘‘police power’’, 
18
for the protection of health, safety, and morals, to 
19
the States. 
20
(5) Even though a State has police power, strict 
21
scrutiny is still applied when laws infringe on funda-
22
mental liberties, and in such instance, government 
23
action is only constitutional when it both achieves a 
24
compelling goal and is narrowly tailored or the least 
25
restrictive alternative to achieve that goal. 
26

•HR 5092 IH
(6) Over the last year, the Federal agencies 
1
have not only encouraged telework, but have even 
2
mandated it, regardless of whether an individual em-
3
ployee assessed the office environment to present an 
4
unreasonable known risk to his or her health, and 
5
regardless of whether the conditions at home were 
6
suitable for productivity or work. In certain cases, 
7
States have done the same with their government 
8
workforces. Arbitrarily requiring an individual to get 
9
vaccinated or lose his or her employment cannot pos-
10
sibly be the least restrictive alternative to a public 
11
health goal at the Federal or State level. Individuals 
12
who object to taking a vaccine or an experimental 
13
vaccine, for any reason, do not impose an inordinate 
14
known risk to the workplace, when every individual 
15
has the liberty to make health decisions for them-
16
selves, including vaccination, masking, social dis-
17
tancing, or other possibly preventive measures. 
18
(7) In our constitutional republic, the Federal 
19
Government must exercise power only in keeping 
20
with the strict limits as enumerated in the Constitu-
21
tion. 
22
(8) The Government is never in a better posi-
23
tion to assess the wisdom and necessity of a par-
24
ticular medical intervention than the individual and

his or her own physician; failing to acknowledge this 
1
most self-evident of truths is anathema to the prin-
2
ciple of self-governance on which our Nation was 
3
founded. 
4
(9) This individual right has been steadfastly 
5
upheld by human rights advocates not only in our 
6
own Nation, but also around the world. 
7
(10) Even the United Nations Committee on 
8
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR) 
9
states in no uncertain terms that health freedoms in-
10
clude the right to control one’s health and body and 
11
‘‘. . . the right to be free from interference, such as 
12
the right to be free from torture, non-consensual 
13
medical treatment and experimentation.’’. 
14
(11) Article 21 ‘‘Health-Informed Consent’’ 
15
prepared by the International Disability Caucus af-
16
firms this ancient truth based in the natural law as 
17
follows: ‘‘Thus, health is not a public good to be pur-
18
sued independent of the will of each individual, but 
19
requires respect for the will of the individual person 
20
with respect to his or her own well-being.’’. 
21
(12) Should the Biden administration, any 
22
agency of the Federal Government, or any State or 
23
locality of this union pursue the path of forced vac-
24
cination, they are choosing to intentionally disregard 
25

•HR 5092 IH
the U.S. Constitution, natural law, human rights 
1
norms, and the will of the individual in making a de-
2
cision that most directly affects his or her own 
3
health and bodily integrity. 
4
(13) This discussion, necessitated by the dan-
5
gerous actions and rhetoric of the left in America, 
6
further compromises the long-enshrined legal re-
7
quirement of informed consent. 
8
(14) There is currently no Federal law requir-
9
ing informed consent because the decisions that 
10
would implicate it have correctly been understood as 
11
matters to be determined at the State and local 
12
level. 
13
(15) Left-wing extremists in the United States 
14
have threatened individuals in such a way that it is 
15
now necessary to pursue a Federal informed consent 
16
law to protect our citizens. 
17
(16) Informed consent must be voluntary.

SEC. 3. INFORMED CONSENT REQUIRED FOR THE ADMINIS-
3
TRATION OF EVERY DOSING OF A VACCINE IN 
4
THE UNITED STATES. 
5
(a) IN GENERAL.—Informed consent shall be re-
6
quired from every individual who receives any dose of any 
7
vaccine administered in the United States. This require-
8
ment applies to FDA-approved vaccines and also vaccines 
9
authorized for emergency use. 
10
(b) DEFINITIONS.— 
11
(1) Informed consent is defined as the vol-
12
untary, explicit written agreement to proceed with 
13
vaccination, made by the individual receiving vac-
14
cination and with complete knowledge of all relevant 
15
facts, including known risks involved or any avail-
16
able alternatives. All known potential risks involved 
17
in accepting or rejecting such vaccination must be 
18
disclosed. Informed consent is based on the moral 
19
and legal premise of individual autonomy: The indi-
20
vidual has the right to make decisions about the in-
21
dividual’s own health and medical conditions and 
22
treatment.
