4
nial Commemorative Coin Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
The Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Built between 1817 and 1825, the original 
8
Erie Canal traversed 363 miles from Albany to Buf-
9
falo.

(2) The Erie Canal was the longest artificial 
1
waterway and the greatest public works project in 
2
North America. 
3
(3) The Erie Canal was one of the most impor-
4
tant steps in the United States initiating its indus-
5
trial revolution, rapidly increasing the productivity 
6
of agriculture and the spread of machinery and 
7
manufactured goods. 
8
(4) The Erie Canal cut the travel time between 
9
Albany and Buffalo in half and reduced freight rates 
10
by 90 percent. This allowed midwestern farmers and 
11
industry to have new access to distant markets. 
12
(5) The Erie Canal opened up the American in-
13
terior for settlement and enabled a new flow of peo-
14
ple and ideas. This fueled social reform movements 
15
such as abolitionism, women’s suffrage, utopian 
16
communities, and multiple religious movements 
17
along the canal corridor. 
18
(6) The Erie Canal continues to define the ge-
19
ography of upstate New York with 80 percent of the 
20
upstate New York population living withing 25 miles 
21
of the corridor. 
22
(7) After 200 years the Erie Canal is still a re-
23
source for its local communities as a close to home
