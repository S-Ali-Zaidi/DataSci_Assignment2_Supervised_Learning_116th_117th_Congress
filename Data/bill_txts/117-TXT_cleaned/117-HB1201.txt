SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress makes the following findings: 
5
(1) Around the world, LGBTQI people face vio-
6
lence, discrimination, hatred, and bigotry. 
7
(2) Sixty-nine countries criminalize same-sex re-
8
lations and at least three countries prohibit the pub-
9
lic support of the LGBTQI community. That is 
10
equal to 35 percent of United Nations member 
11
states. 
12
(3) In several countries, homosexuality is a 
13
crime that is punishable by death. 
14
(4) Intersex people experience prejudice and 
15
discrimination, including the common performance 
16
of medically unnecessary surgeries without their con-
17
sent or approval, because their bodies do not con-
18
form to other people’s expectations about sex and 
19
gender. 
20
(5) Violence and discrimination based on sexual 
21
orientation and gender identity are documented in 
22
the Department of State’s annual Human Rights 
23
Report to Congress. The 2019 report continues to 
24
show a clear pattern of human rights violations in

every region of the world based on sexual orientation 
1
and gender identity. These violations include mur-
2
der, rape, torture, death threats, extortion, and im-
3
prisonment, as well as loss of employment, housing, 
4
access to health care, and other forms of societal 
5
stigma and discrimination. The report further docu-
6
ments LGBTQI-specific restrictions on basic free-
7
doms of assembly, press, and speech in every region 
8
of the world. 
9
(6) In 2013, the Russian Duma passed a law 
10
banning so-called ‘‘homosexual propaganda’’, which 
11
effectively makes it a crime to publicly support 
12
LGBTQI equality or even discuss homosexuality. 
13
This pernicious law is the basis for similar so-called 
14
‘‘antipropaganda’’ legislation in countries across 
15
Eastern Europe and Central Asia, including in 
16
Moldova, Kyrgyzstan, and Belarus. 
17
(7) On April 1, 2017, the Russian newspaper 
18
Novaya Gazeta reported that the government of the 
19
autonomous republic of Chechnya had been arrest-
20
ing, detaining, and torturing gay and bisexual men 
21
in secret prisons since early 2017. An Organization 
22
for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) 
23
fact-finding report released in December 2018 con-
24
firmed the atrocities, documenting ‘‘several waves of

violations of human rights abuses of persons based 
1
on their sexual orientation and gender identity’’. Re-
2
ports throughout 2020 suggest the purge has contin-
3
ued. 
4
(8) In May 2020, the Hungarian Parliament 
5
voted to eliminate the ability for transgender and 
6
intersex Hungarians to legally change their gender 
7
on official documents. In June 2020, Poland’s presi-
8
dent pledged to ban the ‘‘propagation of LGBT ide-
9
ology,’’ and nearly a third of Polish towns and mu-
10
nicipalities have now declared themselves to be 
11
‘‘LGBT-free zones’’. 
12
(9) In December 2013, under the guise of pro-
13
hibiting marriage equality through the Same Sex 
14
Marriage (Prohibition) Act, the Government of Nige-
15
ria adopted a law that further criminalized same-sex 
16
relations and support for LGBTQI people, endan-
17
gering neighbors, friends, doctors, and landlords of 
18
LGBTQI people. In August 2018, 57 men at a party 
19
in Lagos were arrested under this law and 47 were 
20
later charged in December 2019 for ‘‘public show of 
21
same sex amorous relationship’’. While the case was 
22
thrown out in October 2020 due to deficiencies in 
23
the prosecution, the men suffered significant harm 
24
over the course of the two-year trial.

(10) Several countries in South Asia continue 
1
to have draconian laws that criminalize homosexual 
2
acts, which place LGBTQI people in danger and un-
3
dermine their ability to live free from persecution. 
4
(11) In February 2014, the Government of 
5
Uganda adopted a law making ‘‘aggravated homo-
6
sexuality’’ a crime punishable with life imprisonment 
7
and concurrently, the Government of Uganda also 
8
passed laws severely limiting the basic freedoms of 
9
speech and assembly for LGBTQI citizens. Although 
10
the Constitutional Court overturned the Anti-Homo-
11
sexuality Act on a technicality in August 2014, 
12
LGBTQI Ugandans continue to be subjected to dis-
13
crimination and violence, and their government has 
14
in recent years forcibly shut down even private Pride 
15
celebrations in Kampala. 
16
(12) In November 2016, the Government of 
17
Tanzania banned all HIV and AIDS outreach 
18
projects aimed at gay men, including those funded 
19
by the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief 
20
(PEPFAR), forcing the closure of United States- 
21
funded programs providing testing, condoms, and 
22
care to gay men, exacerbating the health needs of 
23
gay men in Tanzania, about 30 percent of whom are 
24
HIV positive. In 2018, various government officials 
25

announced crackdowns on the LGBTQI community, 
1
including a threat by the governor of the largest 
2
city, who announced a purge on LGBTQI individ-
3
uals and asked the public to report them. 
4
(13) A 2020 report by Human Rights Watch 
5
found that in the Northern Triangle countries of El 
6
Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, ‘‘gangs specifi-
7
cally target LGBT people, killing, assaulting, threat-
8
ening or extorting them’’. A 2016 report noted that 
9
transgender women in El Salvador have an average 
10
life expectancy of less than 35 years due to violence, 
11
discrimination, and femicide. 
12
(14) Extreme violence in El Salvador, Nica-
13
ragua, Guatemala, and Honduras has driven 
14
LGBTQI people to flee their countries or origin to 
15
the United States for protection. At the United 
16
States border with Mexico, LGBTQI asylum seekers 
17
face additional violence and many have been re-
18
turned to face persecution in their home countries or 
19
in third countries that are not safe. 
20
(15) On May 23, 2017, and again on July 13, 
21
2018, gay men were publicly caned in the Indo-
22
nesian province of Aceh, while thousands of spec-
23
tators snapped pictures outside a mosque. More re-
24
cently, including in August 2020, police in Indonesia

have arrested men at private parties, sometimes re-
1
leasing their photographs to the news media, endan-
2
gering their lives. The August 2020 raid fits a dis-
3
turbing pattern of Indonesian authorities using the 
4
pornography law as a weapon to target LGBTQI 
5
people. 
6
(16) The Department of State Human Rights 
7
Report for 2019 notes that Egyptian police arrest 
8
LGBTQI persons on charges such as ‘‘debauchery’’, 
9
‘‘prostitution’’, and ‘‘violating the teachings of reli-
10
gion’’, leading to prison sentences of up to 10 years. 
11
According to a local group, there have been more 
12
than 250 arrests since 2013. Arrests have continued 
13
apace in 2020. Rights groups also have reported on 
14
the discredited use of ‘‘virginity’’ and ‘‘anal tests’’ 
15
by Egyptian authorities to attempt to prove sexual 
16
activity, assaults that may constitute cruel, degrad-
17
ing, and inhuman treatment that can rise to the 
18
level of torture under international human rights 
19
law. 
20
(17) Anti-LGBTQI laws not only endanger all 
21
LGBTQI individuals, but also pose serious risks for 
22
those associated with or caring for LGBTQI people. 
23
Studies have shown that when LGBTQI people, es-
24
pecially LGBTQI youth, face discrimination, they

2
(18) According to the Trans Murder Monitoring 
3
Project, which monitors homicides of transgender in-
4
dividuals, 350 trans and gender-diverse were killed 
5
between October 1, 2019, and September 30, 2020, 
6
representing a 6 percent increase in reported mur-
7
ders from the 2019 update. 
8
(19) According to the International Guidelines 
9
on HIV/AIDS and Human Rights, as published by 
10
the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
11
Rights, and according to the reports of the United 
12
Nations Independent Expert on protection against 
13
violence and discrimination based on sexual orienta-
14
tion and gender identity, countries should review 
15
and reform criminal laws and correctional systems to 
16
ensure that they are consistent with international 
17
human rights obligations and are not misused or 
18
targeted against vulnerable groups. 
19
(20) Removing institutionalized discrimination 
20
and targeted persecution against LGBTQI people 
21
around the world is a critical step in the promotion 
22
of human rights and global health internationally.

1
jection, homelessness, and limited educational and 
2

increased risks of substance abuse, suicide, and HIV 
4
infection among LGBTQI youth.

(22) On December 6, 2011, President Barack 
6
Obama released the ‘‘Presidential Memorandum— 
7
International Initiatives to Advance the Human 
8
Rights of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender 
9
Persons’’. The memorandum directed all Federal 
10
agencies engaged abroad to ensure that United 
11
States diplomacy and foreign assistance promote and 
12
protect the human rights of LGBTQI persons. 
13
(23) On February 23, 2015, Secretary of State 
14
John Kerry appointed senior diplomat Randy Berry 
15
as the Department of State’s first-ever Special 
16
Envoy for the Human Rights of LGBTI Persons. 
17
No person was named to that position during the 
18
Trump Administration.

4

5

6
were imposed on British colonies around the world. 
7
She also announced the creation of a fund to sup-
8
port legal reform efforts. 
9
(26) In April 2018, Trinidad and Tobago’s 
10
High Court of Justice issued a landmark ruling de-
11
claring that laws which criminalize same-sex rela-
12
tionships between consenting adults are unconstitu-
13
tional. 
14
(27) In September 2018, the Supreme Court of 
15
India decriminalized same-sex relationships. The 
16
same court also has affirmed the rights of 
17
transgender people as a protected ‘‘third gender’’ 
18
under the Constitution of India. 
19
(28) Angola decriminalized same-sex relation-
20
ships in January 2019, and prohibited discrimina-
21

22

(29) In January 2018, the Inter-American 
1
Court of Human Rights issued an advisory opinion 
2
declaring that the American Convention on Human 
3
Rights, adopted at San Jose November 22, 1969, 
4
grants the right of transgender people to change 
5
their name and gender on public documents, and 
6
that same-sex couples must be granted full legal 
7
rights, including the right to marriage. This ruling 
8
is animating legal reforms and human rights cases 
9
across the Americas. 
10
(30) In September 2018, the legislature in 
11
Chile passed a groundbreaking legal gender recogni-
12
tion law, which allows transgender individuals to 
13
self-determine their legal gender in official docu-
14
ments without a judicial determination or medical 
15
interventions. The Government of Uruguay passed a 
16
similarly expansive gender recognition law in 2018. 
17
(31) In May 2020, the United Nations Inde-
18
pendent Expert on protection against violence and 
19
discrimination based on sexual orientation and gen-
20
der identity released a report on so-called ‘‘conver-
21
sion therapy,’’ which is an umbrella term used to de-
22
scribe interventions based on a belief that a person’s 
23
sexual orientation or gender identity can and should 
24
be changed. The report concludes that such practices

represent significant violations of rights to bodily au-
1
tonomy, health, and free expression, and can breach 
2
the prohibition against torture and ill-treatment. 
3
The Independent Expert concludes by calling for a 
4
global ban on conversion therapy, noting that ‘‘the 
5
psychological pain and suffering inflicted by prac-
6
tices of ‘conversion therapy’ are deep and long-last-
7
ing and often exacerbate the risk of suicide’’. 
8
(32) The global COVID–19 pandemic has exac-
9
erbated inequalities that LGBTQI individuals face, 
10
including access to healthcare, stigma, and discrimi-
11
nation. 
12
(33) Some governments have enacted measures 
13
that target or discriminate against LGBTQI individ-
14
uals and communities under the guise of COVID–19 
15
public health precautions. 
16
(34) In March 2020, Ugandan police arbitrarily 
17
arrested 20 LGBTQI people living in a homeless 
18
shelter, charging them with ‘‘a negligent act likely to 
19
spread infection of disease’’. They were released and 
20
all charges were dropped after nearly two months in 
21
prison. 
22

23

24

transphobic and homophobic rhetoric, as religious 
1
leaders and others scapegoat LGBTQI people for 
2
the spread of the disease. 
3
(36) COVID–19 has also increased barriers to 
4
access health care for LGBTQI individuals. In addi-
5
tion to discrimination in care, the health needs of 
6
LGBTQI people may be deprioritized. For example, 
7
HIV prevention activities have largely ceased due to 
8
the pandemic, elevating risks for transmission 
9
among key population groups. 
10
(37) Due to stay-at-home restrictions, LGBTQI 
11
people may be confined to hostile households, put-
12
ting them at increased risk for gender-based violence 
13
and compounding mental health challenges. 
14
(38) LGBTQI individuals may be unable to ac-
15
cess a government’s COVID support services due to 
16
discrimination. In response, LGBTQI-led civil soci-
17
ety organizations have been forced to shift their pro-
18
grams to provide humanitarian support to their com-
19
munities, sidelining other programs previously per-
20
