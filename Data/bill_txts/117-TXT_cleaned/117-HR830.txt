December 14, 2021. 
Whereas, each December, we recognize the positive contribu-
tions of interscholastic athletic administrators; 
Whereas the position of school athletic administrator is recog-
nized as a profession, which, like other academic profes-
sions, benefits greatly from continued education and cer-
tification; 
Whereas school athletic programs develop young people phys-
ically, mentally, socially, and emotionally by the life les-
sons learned through participation and competition; 
Whereas interscholastic athletic participation is an integral 
part of a student’s educational experience and enhances 
the learning and maturation process;

Whereas athletic administrators preserve, enhance, and pro-
mote the educational values of athletics in our schools 
through professional growth in the areas of education, 
leadership, and service;

ethics, sportsmanship, and personal conduct, and encour-
age coaching staffs, student athletes, and community

trators continue to be at the forefront of developing and 
implementing safety practices, exhibiting wisdom in prep-
aration, adaptation, change, and collaboration; and
