Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Internet Freedom and

Operations Act of 2022’’ or ‘‘INFO Act of 2022’’.

SEC. 2. GLOBAL INTERNET FREEDOM. 
6
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) More than 3,000,000,000 people use the 
8
internet around the world every day to access infor-
9
mation. 
10
(2) Authoritarian and repressive governments 
11
routinely use internet access as a means of sup-

•HR 9397 IH
pressing information sharing and communications 
1
between people, civil society organizations, and jour-
2
nalists. 
3
(3) Following the arrest and subsequent murder 
4
of a 22-year-old woman, Mahsa Amini, while in the 
5
custody of Iran’s ‘‘morality police’’, the government 
6
imposed severe internet and mobile network restric-
7
tions, in an attempt to isolate and intimidate its 
8
people. 
9
(4) Under the cover of such internet blackouts, 
10
the Iranian Government has intensified a brutal 
11
crackdown on peaceful protestors, killing hundreds 
12
and arresting thousands more. 
13
(5) Following its illegal invasion of Ukraine, the 
14
Russian Government has sought to restrict access to 
15
independent reporting and eliminate free speech by 
16
forcing the closure of independent press outlets and 
17
banning social media websites. 
18
(6) Under this expanding policy of state censor-
19
ship and surveillance, the Russian Government has 
20
blocked over 3,300 websites, including both social 
21
media sites such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twit-
22
ter, as well as the BBC, Associated Press, and other 
23
international news outlets.

(7) This authoritarian abuse of technology has 
1
dramatically reduced access to independent informa-
2
tion and has increased the Kremlin’s control over 
3
the daily lives of the Russian people through secret 
4
monitoring systems designed to unmask and surveil 
5
government critics and democracy activists. 
6
(8) The United States has a commitment to 
7
promote and uphold a free and open internet glob-
8
ally. 
9
(9) The demand for internet freedom software, 
10
tools, and technology has increased exponentially in 
11
recent years as authoritarian regimes have pursued 
12
policies of censorship and surveillance. 
13
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
14
gress that— 
15
(1) the United States should provide direct as-
16
sistance to technology and communications entities 
17
engaged in internet freedom programs in countries 
18
restricting internet access and repressing democratic 
19
and civil society; and 
20
(2) the United States should help grow the ca-
21
pacity of these entities to respond rapidly to censor-
22
ship events by supporting the development, licensing, 
23
and launch of platforms that enable direct internet 
24

access and circumvent authoritarian governments’

restrictions. 
2

3
United States to promote internet freedom through pro-
4
grams of the Department of State and the United States 
5

7
net as an open, global space for freedom of expression and 
8
association, which shall be prioritized for countries— 
9

10
pression on the internet; and 
11
(2) that are important to the national interest 
12
of the United States.
