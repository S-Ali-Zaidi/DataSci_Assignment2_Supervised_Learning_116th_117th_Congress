RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the annual Heart Valve Disease 
Awareness Day on February 22, 2022, coinciding with 
American Heart Month. 
Whereas, as many as 11,600,000 people in the United States 
have heart valve disease, which involves damage to one or 
more of the heart’s valves and can reduce blood flow, 
causing the heart to work harder and the body to get less 
oxygen; 
Whereas around 25,000 people in the United States die from 
heart valve disease every year; 
Whereas more than 1 in 10 people age 75 and older are esti-
mated to have moderate to severe valve disease; 
Whereas if not treated, some forms of heart valve disease can 
lead to major health problems including decreased mobil-

ity, disability, loss of independence, heart failure, stroke, 
blood clotting, or even death; 
Whereas when aortic stenosis, a common form of valve dis-
ease, becomes severe, the average survival rate without 
surgical intervention is as low as 50 percent at 2 years 
after the onset of symptoms and 20 percent at 5 years 
after such onset; 
Whereas patients with severe mitral regurgitation, which can 
be caused by mitral valve prolapse, who don’t have sur-
gery have mortality rates of 20 percent after 1 year and 
50 percent after 5 years; 
Whereas symptoms of heart valve disease such as shortness 
of breath, excessive fatigue, and fainting are often dis-
missed as normal aspects of aging; 
Whereas people are at higher risk of developing heart valve 
disease if they have high blood pressure, high cholesterol, 
insulin resistance, diabetes, coronary heart disease, a con-
genital heart abnormality or family history of valve dis-
ease, a history of heart problems like heart attack or 
heart failure, rheumatic fever or infective endocarditis, or 
previous valve disease; 
Whereas people are also at higher risk of developing heart 
valve disease if they are a smoker, overweight or obese, 
get little physical activity or exercise, or are older in age; 
Whereas heart valve disease, with proper education and 
awareness, can often be detected through a simple phys-
ical exam and treated with either valve repair or valve re-
placement; and 
Whereas February 22, 2022, is the designated day to observe 
Heart Valve Disease Awareness Day: Now, therefore, be 
it
