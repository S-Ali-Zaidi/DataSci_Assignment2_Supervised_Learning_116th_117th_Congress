Whereas the number of colorectal cancer cases among men is 
expected to be over 79,520 in 2021, and over 28,320 men 
are expected to die from it; 
Whereas the likelihood that a man will develop prostate can-
cer is 1 in 8; 
Whereas an estimated 248,530 men will be diagnosed with 
prostate cancer in 2021, and an estimated 34,130 of 
them will die from the disease; 
Whereas African-American men in the United States have the 
highest incidence of prostate cancer; 
Whereas significant numbers of male-related health problems, 
such as prostate cancer, testicular cancer, infertility, and 
colon cancer, could be detected and treated if men’s 
awareness of such problems were more pervasive; 
Whereas educating both the public and health care providers 
about the importance of early detection of male health 
problems will result in reducing rates of mortality for 
these diseases; 
Whereas appropriate use of tests such as prostate-specific 
antigen (PSA) exams and blood pressure and cholesterol 
screens, in conjunction with clinical examination and self- 
testing for problems such as testicular cancer, can result 
in the detection of many of these problems in their early 
stages and increases in the survival rates to nearly 100 
percent; 
Whereas women are twice as likely as men to visit the doctor 
for annual examinations and preventive services; 
Whereas men are less likely than women to visit their health 
center or physician for regular screening examinations of 
male-related problems for a variety of reasons, including

fear, lack of health insurance, lack of information, and 
cost factors;

Whereas the Governors of all 50 States have issued proclama-
tions annually declaring Men’s Health Week in their 
States, as have mayors of over 350 cities; 
Whereas, since 1994, National Men’s Health Week has been 
celebrated each June by hundreds of States, cities, local-
ities, public health departments, health care entities, 
churches, and community organizations throughout the 
Nation that promote health awareness events focused on 
men and families; 
Whereas the National Men’s Health Week website has been 
established at www.menshealthmonth.org and features 
proclamations from Governors and mayors, and National 
Men’s Health Week events; 
Whereas men who are educated about the value that preven-
tive health care can play in prolonging their lifespan and 
their role as productive family members will be more like-
ly to participate in health screenings; 
Whereas men and their families are encouraged to increase 
their awareness of the importance of a healthy lifestyle, 
regular exercise, and medical checkups; and
