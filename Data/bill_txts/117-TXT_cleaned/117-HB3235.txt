SECTION 1. PROHIBITION ON EXECUTIVE AGENCIES ACT-
1
ING 
IN 
CONTRAVENTION 
OF 
EXECUTIVE 
2
ORDER 13950. 
3
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
4
(1) On September 22, 2020, President Trump 
5
issued Executive Order (EO) 13950 ‘‘Combating 
6
Race and Sex Stereotyping’’. 
7
(2) EO 13950 was designed ‘‘to promote econ-
8
omy and efficiency in Federal contracting, to pro-
9
mote unity in the Federal workforce, and to combat 
10
offensive and anti-American race and sex stereo-
11
typing and scapegoating’’. 
12
(3) Specifically EO 13950, among other things, 
13
prohibited Federal agencies from teaching, advo-
14
cating, acting upon, or promoting in any training to 
15
agency employees certain divisive concepts, such as 
16
those that hold ‘‘(1) one race or sex is inherently su-
17
perior to another race or sex; (2) the United States 
18
is fundamentally racist or sexist; (3) an individual, 
19
by virtue of his or her race or sex, is inherently rac-
20
ist, sexist, or oppressive, whether consciously or un-
21
consciously; (4) an individual should be discrimi-
22
nated against or receive adverse treatment solely or 
23
partly because of his or her race or sex; (5) members 
24
of one race or sex cannot and should not attempt to 
25
treat others without respect to race or sex; (6) an

•HR 3235 IH
individual’s moral character is necessarily deter-
1
mined by his or her race or sex; (7) an individual, 
2
by virtue of his or her race or sex, bears responsi-
3
bility for actions committed in the past by other 
4
members of the same race or sex; (8) any individual 
5
should feel discomfort, guilt, anguish, or any other 
6
form of psychological distress on account of his or 
7
her race or sex; or (9) meritocracy or traits such as 
8
a hard work ethic are racist or sexist, or were cre-
9
ated by a particular race to oppress another race’’. 
10
(4) EO 13950 further required that diversity 
11
and inclusion efforts of Federal agencies must ‘‘first 
12
and foremost, encourage agency employees not to 
13
judge each other by their color, race, ethnicity, sex, 
14
or any other characteristic protected by Federal 
15
law’’. 
16
(5) EO 13950 was issued soon after Office of 
17
Management and Budget Director Russell Vought 
18
issued a September 4, 2020, memorandum wherein 
19
he explained— 
20
(A) millions of taxpayer dollars have been 
21
spent on training Federal Government workers 
22
to ‘‘believe divisive, anti-American propaganda’’;

(B) training sessions that have taught 
1
‘‘virtually all White people contribute [or ben-
2
efit from] to racism’’; and 
3
(C) training sessions have claimed that 
4
‘‘there is racism embedded in the belief that 
5
America is the land of opportunity or the belief 
6
that the most qualified person should receive a 
7
job’’. 
8
(6) In the September 4, 2020, memorandum, 
9
Director 
Vought 
further 
explained 
that 
such 
10
trainings, ‘‘not only run counter to the fundamental 
11
beliefs for which our Nation has stood since its in-
12
ception, but they also engender division and resent-
13
ment within the Federal workforce’’. 
14
(7) EO 13950 and the September 4, 2020, 
15
memorandum stood as a direct rebuke of so-called 
16
‘‘Critical Race Theory’’. 
17
(8) Critical Race Theory, according to Heritage 
18
Foundation visiting fellow Chris Rufo, is ‘‘the idea 
19
that the United States is a fundamentally racist 
20
country and that all of our institutions including the 
21
law, culture, business, the economy are all designed 
22
to maintain white supremacy’’.

(9) Critical Race Theory is, at its core, un- 
1
American, discriminatory, and based on Marxist ide-
2
ology. 
3
(10) Critical Race Theory relies on a Marxist 
4
analytical framework, viewing society in terms of op-
5
pressed and oppressor, and instills a defeatist men-
6
tality in those it casts as the oppressed. 
7
(11) Critical Race Theory’s objective is the de-
8
struction and replacement of Western Enlighten-
9
ment Liberalism with a Marxist influenced govern-
10
ment. 
11
(12) Critical Race Theory intentionally seeks to 
12
undermine capitalism and western values, such as 
13
property rights, free speech, and the very concept of 
14
Lockean natural rights. 
15
(13) At the Department of Homeland Security, 
16
Rufo explained, trainers ‘‘insisted that statements 
17
such as ‘America is the land of opportunity’, ‘Every-
18
body can succeed in this society, if they work hard 
19
enough’, and ‘I believe the most qualified person 
20
should get the job’ are racist and harmful’’. 
21
(14) At a training session at the National Cred-
22
it Union Administration, Howard Ross taught that 
23
‘‘It is irrefutable that [America society] is a system 
24
based on racism’’ and ‘‘good and decent [white] peo-
25

•HR 3235 IH
ple . . . support the status quo [of] a system of sys-
1
tematized racism’’. 
2
(15) According to Rufo, employees of the De-
3
partment of the Treasury and Federal financial 
4
agencies attended a series of events at which diver-
5
sity trainer Howard Ross taught employees that all 
6
White Americans are complicit in White supremacy 
7
‘‘by automatic response to the ways were taught 
8
Whiteness includes white privilege and white su-
9
premacy’’. 
10
(16) Martin Luther King Jr., in his ‘‘I have a 
11
dream speech’’ said, ‘‘I look to a day when people 
12
will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by 
13
the content of their character’’. 
14
(17) By teaching that certain individuals, by 
15
virtue of inherent characteristics, are inherently 
16
flawed, Critical Race Theory contradicts the basic 
17
principle upon which our Nation was founded that 
18
all men and women are created equal. 
19
(18) Critical Race Theory’s teachings stand in 
20
contrast to the overarching goal of the Civil Rights 
21
Act of 1964 to prevent discrimination on the basis 
22
of race, color, or national origin in the United 
23
States.

•HR 3235 IH
(19) Critical Race Theory seeks to portray the 
1
United States not as a united Nation of people, fam-
2
ilies, and communities striving for a common pur-
3
pose, but rather one of many victimized groups 
4
based on sex, race, national origin, and gender. 
5
(20) Critical Race Theory, and its emphasis on 
6
predetermining the thoughts, beliefs, and actions of 
7
a person, flouts the Constitution of the United 
8
States guarantee of equal protection under the law 
9
to all men and women. 
10
(21) On January 20, 2021, President Joe 
11
Biden issued an Executive order revoking President 
12
Trump’s EO 13950. 
13
(22) The American people should defend the 
14
civil rights of all people and seek to eliminate racism 
15
wherever it exists. Critical Race Theory and its 
16
propagation within the Federal Government through 
17
President Biden’s executive action desecrates this 
18
paramount pursuit. 
19
(b) PROHIBITION.—No executive agency (as defined 
20
in section 105 of title 5, United States Code) may act in 
21
contravention of Executive Order 13950 (85 Fed. Reg.
