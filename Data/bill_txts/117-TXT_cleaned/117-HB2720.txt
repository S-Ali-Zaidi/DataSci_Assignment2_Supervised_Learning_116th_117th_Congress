•HR 2720 IH
(1) The COVID–19 pandemic has exposed the 
1
vulnerability of the United States supply chains for, 
2
and lack of domestic production of, personal protec-
3
tive equipment (PPE). 
4
(2) The United States requires a robust, secure, 
5
and wholly domestic PPE supply chain to safeguard 
6
public health and national security. 
7
(3) Issuing a strategy that provides the govern-
8
ment’s anticipated needs over the next three years 
9
will enable suppliers to assess what changes, if any, 
10
are needed in their manufacturing capacity to meet 
11
expected demands. 
12
(4) In order to foster a domestic PPE supply 
13
chain, United States industry needs a strong and 
14
consistent demand signal from the Federal Govern-
15
ment providing the necessary certainty to expand 
16
production capacity investment in the United States. 
17
(5) In order to effectively incentivize investment 
18
in the United States and the re-shoring of manufac-
19
turing, long-term contracts must be no shorter than 
20
three years in duration. 
21
(6) The United States needs a long-term invest-
22
ment strategy for the domestic production of PPE

items critical to the United States national response
