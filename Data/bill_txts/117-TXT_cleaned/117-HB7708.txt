SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

7
(1) From April to September 1975, the United 
8

130,000 Vietnamese refugees to the United States 
1
following the end of the Vietnam War. During this 
2
time, more than 50,000 Vietnamese refugees were 
3
processed through Camp Pendleton for resettlement 
4
in southern California. 
5
(2) In the 4 decades since they fled Vietnam as 
6
refugees, Vietnamese Americans have woven their 
7
stories into the American fabric. 
8
(3) The largest concentrations of Vietnamese 
9
Americans can be found in Orange County, Cali-
10
fornia, followed by San Jose (California), Houston 
11
(Texas), Seattle (Washington), Northern Virginia, 
12
and New Orleans (Louisiana). 
13
(4) According to the American Community Sur-
14
vey, 1.4 million Americans speak Vietnamese at 
15
home, the fourth-most-common language other than 
16
English. 
17
(5) Immigrants may find it difficult to assimi-
18
late into their new communities as a result of the 
19
trauma of war. A 2018 study published by Rashmi 
20
Gangamma and Daran Shipman in the Journal of 
21
Marital and Family Therapy noted that ‘‘the trau-
22
matic nature of (an immigrant’s) forced displace-
23
ment flight, and resettlement can increase vulner-
24
ability to mental distress.’’ First generation immi-

grant children are especially vulnerable to gang vio-
1
lence when their parents find it difficult to navigate 
2
their new communities culturally and politically. 
3
(6) In 2008, the United States and Vietnam 
4
signed a bilateral repatriation agreement, hereinafter 
5
known as the 2008 Vietnam-U.S. Memorandum of 
6
Understanding (MOU). 
7
(7) According to Section 2, Article 2 of the 
8
2008 Vietnam-U.S. MOU, ‘‘Vietnamese citizens are 
9
not subject to return to Vietnam under this Agree-
10
ment if they arrived in the United States before July 
11
12, 1995, the date on which diplomatic relations 
12
were re-established between the U.S. Government 
13
and the Vietnamese Government. The U.S. Govern-
14
ment and the Vietnamese Government maintain 
15
their respective legal positions relative to Vietnamese 
16
citizens who departed Vietnam for the United States 
17
prior to that date.’’. 
18
(8) Under President George Bush and Presi-
19
dent Barack Obama, the United States recognized 
20
the 2008 Vietnam-U.S. MOU’s protections and re-
21
frained from deporting pre-1995 Vietnamese refu-
22
gees.

24
Trump’s Administration signed a new agreement

3
nent residents who have committed certain minor 
4
crimes and others who came to the United States as
