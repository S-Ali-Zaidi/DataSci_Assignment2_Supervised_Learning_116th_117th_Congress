1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

able Care Act (42 U.S.C. 300u–11) was designed 
1
‘‘to provide for expanded and sustained national in-
2
vestment in prevention and public health programs 
3
to improve health and help restrain the rate of 
4
growth in private and public health care costs’’. 
5
(2) Funding under such section is essential to 
6
core efforts at the Department of Health and 
7
Human Services and in State, local, Tribal, and ter-
8
ritorial health departments to prevent and control 
9
the spread of infectious disease, and prevent injuries 
10
and the development of chronic conditions. 
11
(3) Prevention and Public Health Fund dollars 
12
support evidenced-based investments in tobacco use 
13
prevention and cessation, nutrition, mental health, 
14
childhood lead poisoning prevention, elder care ini-
15
tiatives, and immunizations, among other prevention 
16
initiatives. Funding gives States and communities 
17
the flexibility to respond to public health threats 
18
that may be unique to their communities and bol-
19
sters the State, local, Tribal, and territorial response 
20
to global public health threats, including COVID–19. 
21
(4) Such prevention efforts have shown to be 
22
effective. Funding increases for community-based 
23
public health programs reduce infant deaths and 
24
preventable deaths caused by cancer, diabetes, and

cardiovascular disease. Every dollar spent on preven-
1
tion saves nearly $6 in health spending and every 
2
dollar spent on childhood vaccines saves $16.50 in 
3
future health care costs. 
4
(5) Investments in prevention reduce the cost of 
5
health care in the United States. $2,900,000,000 in 
6
investments in community-based disease prevention 
7
is estimated to save $16,500,000,000 annually with-
8
in 5 years. 
9
(6) Cuts to the Prevention and Public Health 
10
Fund and other public health prevention efforts un-
11
dermine efforts to create an affordable and acces-
12
sible health care system, and a better quality of life 
13
for Americans. 
14
(7) Cuts to the Prevention and Public Health 
15
Fund endanger the ability of States and localities to 
16
distribute vaccinations and public health information 
17
successfully. The Prevention and Public Health 
18
Fund is critical to the growth of the Immunization 
19
Program and to the Epidemiology and Laboratory 
20
Capacity Program of the Centers for Disease Con-
21
trol and Prevention under section 317 of the Public 
22
Health Service Act. 
23
(8) Restoring Prevention and Public Health 
24
Fund funding to $2,000,000,000 annually will allow

success.

Fund funding to $2,000,000,000 will give the Cen-

ters for Disease Control and Prevention and State,

funding that they need to invest in prevention ef-
