To amend the Tibetan Policy Act of 2002 to modify certain 
provisions of that Act. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Promoting a Resolu-
4
tion to the Tibet-China Conflict Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) It has been the long-standing policy of the 
8
United States to encourage meaningful and direct 
9
dialogue between People’s Republic of China au-

thorities and the Dalai Lama or his representatives, 
1
without preconditions, to seek a settlement that re-
2
solves differences. 
3
(2) Ten rounds of dialogue held between 2002 
4
and 2010 between the People’s Republic of China 
5
authorities and the 14th Dalai Lama’s representa-
6
tives failed to produce a settlement that resolved dif-
7
ferences, and the two sides have not met since Janu-
8
ary 2010. 
9
(3) An obstacle to further dialogue is that the 
10
Government of the People’s Republic of China con-
11
tinues to impose conditions on His Holiness the 
12
Dalai Lama for a resumption of dialogue, including 
13
a demand that he say that Tibet has been part of 
14
China since ancient times, which the Dalai Lama 
15
has refused to do because it is false. 
16
(4) United States Government statements that 
17
the United States considers Tibet a part of the Peo-
18
ple’s Republic of China have reflected the reality on 
19
the ground that the Government of the People’s Re-
20
public of China has exerted effective control over 
21
Tibet. 
22
(5) The United States Government has never 
23
taken the position that Tibet was a part of China 
24
since ancient times or that the means by which the

Government of the People’s Republic of China came 
1
to exert effective control over Tibet was consistent 
2
with international law or included the free or mean-
3
ingful consent of the Tibetan people. 
4
(6) United States Government documents dated 
5
January 9, 1919, June 1, 1944, June 17, 1949, 
6
April 4, 1951, December 3, 1951, March 23, 1961, 
7
and February 14, 1963, listed Tibet as an entity 
8
separate and distinct from China. 
9
(7) Article 1 of the International Covenant on 
10
Civil and Political Rights and Article 1 the Inter-
11
national Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
12
Rights provide that ‘‘All peoples have the right of 
13
self-determination. By virtue of that right they freely 
14
determine their political status and freely pursue 
15
their economic, social and cultural development.’’. 
16
(8) Under international law, including United 
17
Nations General Assembly Resolution 2625, the 
18
right to self-determination is the right of a people to 
19
determine its own destiny and the exercise of this 
20
right can result in a variety of outcomes ranging 
21
from independence, federation, protection, some 
22
form of autonomy or full integration within a State. 
23
(9) United Nations General Assembly Resolu-
24
tion 1723, adopted on December 20, 1961, called for

the ‘‘cessation of practices which deprive the Tibetan 
1
people of their fundamental human rights and free-
2
doms, including their right to self-determination.’’. 
3
(10) In a December 30, 1950, note to the Gov-
4
ernments of the United Kingdom and India, the De-
5
partment of State wrote that ‘‘The United States, 
6
which was one of the early supporters of the prin-
7
ciple of self-determination of peoples, believes that 
8
the Tibetan people has the same inherent right as 
9
any other to have the determining voice in its polit-
10
ical destiny. It is believed further that, should devel-
11
opments warrant, consideration could be given to 
12
recognition of Tibet as an independent State.’’. 
13
(11) In a June 2, 1951, telegram to the United 
14
States Embassy in New Delhi, the State Depart-
15
ment wrote that Tibet should not ‘‘be compelled by 
16
duress [to] accept [the] violation [of] its autonomy’’ 
17
and that the Tibetan people should ‘‘enjoy certain 
18
rights [of] self-determination, commensurate with 
19
[the] autonomy Tibet has maintained since [the] 
20
Chinese revolution.’’ 
21
(12) Secretary of State Antony Blinken, in a 
22
May 26, 2022, speech entitled ‘‘The Administra-
23
tion’s Approach to the People’s Republic of China,’’ 
24
said that the rules-based international order’s 
25

•HR 8365 IH
‘‘founding documents include the UN Charter and 
1
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which 
2
enshrined concepts like self-determination, sov-
3
ereignty, the peaceful settlement of disputes. These 
4
are not Western constructs. They are reflections of 
5
the world’s shared aspirations.’’. 
6
(13) The Tibetan Policy Act of 2002 (22 
7
U.S.C. 6901 note), in directing the United States 
8
Government ‘‘to promote the human rights and dis-
9
tinct religious, cultural, linguistic, and historical 
10
identity of the Tibetan people’’ acknowledges that 
11
the Tibetan people possess a distinct religious, cul-
12
tural, linguistic, and historical identity. 
13
(14) Department of State reports on human 
14
rights and religious freedom have consistently docu-
15
mented repression by the People’s Republic of China 
16
authorities against Tibetans as well as acts of defi-
17
ance and resistance by Tibetan people against the 
18
People’s Republic of China policies. 
19
(15) Section 355 of the Foreign Relations Au-
20
thorization Act, Fiscal Years 1992 and 1993 (Public 
21
Law 102–138; 105 Stat. 713) stated that it is the 
22
sense of Congress that— 
23
(A) ‘‘Tibet, including those areas incor-
24

3
(B) ‘‘Tibet’s true representatives are the 
4
Dalai Lama and the Tibetan Government in 
5
exile as recognized by the Tibetan people’’; 
6
(C) ‘‘Tibet has maintained throughout its 
7
history a distinctive and sovereign national, cul-
8
tural, and religious identity separate from that 
9
of China and, except during periods of illegal 
10
Chinese occupation, has maintained a separate 
11
and sovereign political and territorial identity’’; 
12
(D) ‘‘historical evidence of this separate 
13
identity may be found in Chinese archival docu-
14
ments and traditional dynastic histories, in 
15
United States recognition of Tibetan neutrality 
16
during World War II, and in the fact that a 
17
number of countries including the United 
18
States, Mongolia, Bhutan, Sikkim, Nepal, 
19
India, Japan, Great Britain, and Russia recog-
20
nized Tibet as an independent nation or dealt

to oppose aggression and other illegal uses of

to condemn violations of international law, in-

(G) ‘‘numerous United States declarations

since the Chinese invasion have recognized Ti-

15
pany division K of the Consolidated Appropriations

Act for Fiscal Year 2022 (Public Law 117–103)

states that ‘‘Funds appropriated by the Act should

20
Tibet, including the Tibet Autonomous Region and 
21

SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
4
It is the policy of the United States that— 
5
(1) the Tibetan people are a people entitled to 
6
the right of self-determination under international 
7
law, including the International Covenant on Civil 
8
and Political Rights and the International Covenant 
9
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and that 
10
their ability to exercise this right is precluded by the 
11
current policies of the People’s Republic of China; 
12
and 
13
(2) the conflict between Tibet and the People’s 
14
Republic of China is unresolved, and that the legal 
15
status of Tibet remains to be determined in accord-
16
ance with international law. 
17
SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
18
It is the sense of Congress that— 
19
(1) claims made by officials of the People’s Re-
20
public of China and the Chinese Communist Party 
21
that Tibet has been a part of China since ancient 
22
times are historically false; 
23
(2) the Government of the People’s Republic of 
24
China has failed to meet the expectations of the

the Dalai Lama or his representatives toward a

tween Tibet and the People’s Republic of China; and
