3
portation Security Administration, in coordination with 
4
U.S. Customs and Border Protection, is authorized to con-
5
duct a pilot program at not more than ten foreign last 
6
point of departure airports to permit passengers and their 
7
accessible property arriving on direct flights or flight seg-
8
ments originating at such participating foreign airports to 
9
continue on additional flights or flight segments origi-
10
nating in the United States without additional security re- 
11
screening if—

14
ment described in subsection (c); 
15

16
eign airports are unable to access their checked bag-
17
gage prior to arrival at their final destination; and

sengers arriving from participating foreign airports 
20

(b) RE-SCREENING OF CHECKED BAGGAGE.—The 
1
Administrator may determine whether, based on risk, 
2
checked baggage arriving from participating foreign air-
3
ports referenced in subsection (a) must be re-screened in 
4
the United States by an explosives detection system before 
5
such baggage continues on any additional flight or flight 
6
segment. 
7
(c) AVIATION SECURITY SCREENING AGREEMENT 
8
DESCRIBED.—An aviation security screening agreement 
9
described in this subsection is an agreement with a foreign 
10
country that delineates and implements security standards 
11
and protocols utilized at a foreign last point of departure 
12
airport that are determined by the Administrator to be 
13
comparable to those of the United States and therefore 
14
sufficiently effective to enable passengers and their acces-
15
sible property to deplane into sterile areas of airports in 
16
the United States without the need for re-screening. 
17
(d) RE-SCREENING REQUIREMENT.—If the Adminis-
18
trator determines that the foreign country participating 
19
in the aviation security screening agreement has not main-
20
tained and implemented security standards and protocols 
21
comparable to those of the United States at foreign last 
22
point of departure airports at which a pilot program has 
23
been established in accordance with this section, the Ad-
24
ministrator shall ensure that passengers and their prop-

3
States. 
4
(e) TERMINATION.—Each aviation security screening 
5
agreement shall— 
6
(1) be executed no later than three years after 
7

8
(2) be in effect for up to four years from the 
9
date of execution. 
10
(f) BRIEFINGS TO CONGRESS.—The Administrator 
11
shall brief the appropriate committees of Congress on— 
12
(1) the substance of each aviation security 
13
screening agreement within 90 days after the agree-
14
ment is executed; and 
15
(2) the status of the pilot program annually 
16
until the expiration of the last aviation security 
17
screening agreement. 
18
(g) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.—Nothing in this sec-
19
tion may be construed as limiting the authority of U.S. 
20
