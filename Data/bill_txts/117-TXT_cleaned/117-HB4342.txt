(1) Too many Americans cannot achieve finan-
1
cial stability due to income volatility, the rising cost 
2
of living, wage stagnation, and a lack of affordable 
3
housing. 
4
(2) Real wages have failed to keep pace with in-
5
flation, meaning the purchasing power of American 
6
households has not changed in 40 years. 
7
(3) Income volatility, defined as an annual in-
8
come fluctuation of 25 percent or more, impacts 
9
nearly half of the United States population. 
10
(4) Thirty-six percent of American households 
11
indicate that they would face difficulty covering a 
12
$400 emergency expense with readily available cash 
13
or a checking account. There are significant dispari-
14
ties based on race and ethnicity: While only 38 per-
15
cent of White households report difficulty meeting 
16
an unexpected $400 expense, the same is true for 
17
more than half of Black and Latinx households. 
18
(5) Full-time minimum wage earners cannot af-
19
ford an average 2-bedroom apartment anywhere in 
20
the United States.

(6) The changing nature of the economy, in-
22
cluding the rise of the gig economy, unemployment 
23
risks posed by automation, and the fluctuating na-
