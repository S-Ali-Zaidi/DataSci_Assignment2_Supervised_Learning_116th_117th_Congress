SECTION 1. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following: 
4
(1) The Founders of the United States viewed 
5
intellectual property rights as fundamental rights 
6
that must be protected by the government.

8
States Constitution affirmatively defends the individ-

ing Congress power ‘‘to promote the Progress of 
1
Science and Useful arts, by securing, for limited 
2
Times, to Authors and Inventors, the exclusive Right 
3
to their respective Writings and Discoveries’’. 
4
(3) The Commission on the Theft of American 
5
Intellectual Property estimates that intellectual 
6
property theft costs the United States economy ap-
7
proximately $600 billion annually. 
8
(4) A March 1, 2019, CNBC poll found that 
9
one-in-five United States corporations say that 
10
China has stolen proprietary intellectual property 
11
within the last year and one-in-three United States 
12
corporations state that China has stolen their intel-
13
lectual property within the last decade. 
14
(5) The Commission on the Theft of American 
15
Intellectual Property further reports that China’s in-
16
dustrial policies call for the ‘‘absorption, digestion, 
17
and re-innovation of foreign intellectual property to 
18
meet the Made in China 2025 goal of 40 percent 
19
self-sufficiency by 2020 and 75 percent by 2025’’. 
20
(6) The Chinese Government remains the 
21
world’s principle source of intellectual property theft. 
22
(7) China engages in foreign ownership restric-
23
tions that include joint venture requirements and ad-
24

companies to transfer intellectual property and pro-
1
prietary technology to Chinese companies. 
2
(8) China imposes harmful contractual obliga-
3
tions on United States companies seeking to license 
4
their proprietary technology to Chinese-based firms 
5
and is engaged in a purposeful and unfair practice 
6
of acquiring United States businesses to generate 
7
technology transfers. 
8
(9) The Chinese Government is engaged in 
9
cyberattacks against United States businesses, mili-
10
tary installations, and government entities, including 
11
the United States Office of Personnel Management, 
12
resulting in the theft of untold proprietary informa-
13
tion and commercial trade secrets. 
14
(10) China is undertaking the ‘‘greatest intel-
15
lectual property theft in human history’’ according 
16
to former Secretary of Defense Mark Esper. 
17
(11) Congress must take bold action to combat 
18
the Chinese Government’s concerted efforts to per-
19
petrate cyber-attacks against United States entities 
20
and steal United States intellectual property. 
21
(12) Denial orders are issued by the Assistant 
22

export privileges prohibits the person from partici-
1
pating in any way in any transaction subject to the 
2
Export Administration Regulations (EAR). Further-
3
more, it is unlawful for any other entity or indi-
4
vidual to participate in any way in an export trans-
5
action subject to the EAR with a person subject to 
6
a denial order.

(13) On April 16, 2018, former Secretary of 
8
Commerce Wilbur Ross announced that the Bureau 
9
of Industry and Security of the Department of Com-
10
merce had issued an order to deny the export privi-
11
leges of Zhongxing Telecommunications Equipment 
12
Corporation of Shenzhen, China (‘‘ZTE Corpora-
13
tion’’) and ZTE Kangxun Telecommunications Ltd. 
14
of Hi-New Shenzhen, China. 
15
SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
16
It is the sense of Congress that— 
17
(1) denial orders are an important foreign pol-
18
icy tool to use against foreign entities and individ-
19
uals, especially Chinese persons, with a pattern of 
20
violating United States laws, especially laws relating 
21
to intellectual property; and 
22
(2) the Department of Commerce should vigor-
23
ously utilize denial orders to hold such persons ac-
24
countable.

SEC. 3. STRATEGY. 
1
Not later than one year after the date of the enact-
2
ment of this Act, the Secretary of Commerce, in consulta-
3
tion with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Treas-
4
ury, and Attorney General, shall submit to Congress a 
5
strategy regarding how denial orders issued by the Bureau 
6
of Industry and Security of the Department of Commerce 
7
to deny the export privileges of foreign entities and indi-
8
viduals, especially entities and individuals located in 
9
China, can be better utilized as part of a holistic approach 
10
to hold such entities and individuals accountable for theft 
11
of United States intellectual property.
