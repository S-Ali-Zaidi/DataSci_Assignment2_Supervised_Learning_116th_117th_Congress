Congress finds the following:

•HR 4258 IH
(1) The lack of an easy, affordable, and reliable 
1
way for organizations, businesses, and government 
2
agencies to identify whether an individual is who 
3
they claim to be online creates an attack vector that 
4
is widely exploited by adversaries in cyberspace, and 
5
precludes many high-value transactions from being 
6
available online. 
7
(2) Incidents of identity theft and identity 
8
fraud continue to rise in the United States, where 
9
more than 164,000,000 consumer records containing 
10
personally identifiable information were breached in 
11
2019, increasing the total number of data breaches 
12
by 17 percent from the previous year. 
13
(3) In 2019, losses resulting from identity 
14
fraud amounted to $16,900,000,000. 
15
(4) In 2019, the Director of the Treasury De-
16
partment Financial Crimes Enforcement Network 
17
stated, ‘‘The abuse of personally identifiable infor-
18
mation, and other building blocks of identity, is a 
19
key enabler behind much of the fraud and 
20
cybercrime affecting our nation today.’’. 
21
(5) Trustworthy digital identity solutions can 
22
help under-banked and unbanked individuals better 
23
access to digital financial services through innovative 
24
delivery channels that promote financial inclusion.

•HR 4258 IH
(6) The inadequacy of current digital identity 
1
solutions degrades security and privacy for all Amer-
2
icans, and next generation solutions are needed that 
3
improve both security and privacy. 
4
(7) 
Government 
entities, 
as 
authoritative 
5
issuers of identity in the United States, are uniquely 
6
positioned to deliver critical components that ad-
7
dress deficiencies in our digital identity infrastruc-
8
ture and augment private sector digital identity and 
9
authentication solutions. 
10
(8) State governments are particularly well 
11
suited to play a role in enhancing digital identity so-
12
lutions used by both the public and private sectors, 
13
given the role of State governments as the issuers of 
14
driver’s licenses and other identity documents com-
15
monly used today. 
16
(9) The private sector drives much of the inno-
17
vation around digital identity in the United States 
18
and has an important role to play in delivering dig-
19
ital identity solutions. 
20
(10) The 2016 bipartisan Commission on En-
21
hancing National Cybersecurity called for the Fed-
22
eral Government to ‘‘create an interagency task 
23
force directed to find secure, user-friendly, privacy- 
24
centric ways in which agencies can serve as one au-

thoritative source to validate identity attributes in 
1
the broader identity market. This action would en-
2
able government agencies and the private sector to 
3
drive significant risk out of new account openings 
4
and other high-risk, high-value online services, and 
5
it would help all citizens more easily and securely 
6
engage in transactions online’’. 
7
(11) The public and private sectors should col-
8
laborate to deliver solutions that promote confidence, 
9
privacy, choice, and innovation. 
10
(12) It should be the policy of the Government 
11
to use the authorities and capabilities of the Govern-
12
ment to enhance the security, reliability, privacy, 
13
and convenience of digital identity solutions that 
14
support and protect transactions between individ-
15
uals, government entities, and businesses, and that 
16
enable Americans to prove who they are online.
