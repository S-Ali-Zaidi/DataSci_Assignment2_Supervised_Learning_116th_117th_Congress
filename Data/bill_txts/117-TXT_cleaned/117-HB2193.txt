A BILL 
To direct the Occupational Safety and Health Administration 
to issue an occupational safety and health standard to 
protect workers from heat-related injuries and illnesses. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE AND FINDINGS. 
3
(a) SHORT TITLE.—This Act may be cited as the 
4
‘‘Asuncion Valdivia Heat Illness and Fatality Prevention 
5
Act of 2021’’. 
6
(b) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Excessive heat exposure poses a direct 
8
threat to workers and the economy. Climate change 
9
01:07 May 21, 2021

•HR 2193 IH
increases this danger, as 19 of the 20 hottest years 
1
on record have occurred since 2001. Rising tempera-
2
tures are projected to cause an increase in heat-re-
3
lated workplace injuries and illnesses, a dramatic 
4
loss in labor capacity, and decreased productivity. 
5
(2) On average, 3 times as many people die 
6
from extreme heat in the United States each year 
7
than from hurricanes, floods, and tornadoes com-
8
bined. 
9
(3) Heat-related illnesses can arise when high 
10
temperatures rise above the body’s capacity to dispel 
11
heat. Impacts range from comparatively minor prob-
12
lems such as heat cramps to severe afflictions such 
13
as organ damage, heat exhaustion, stroke, and 
14
death. 
15
(4) Heat stress and COVID–19 are a combined 
16
threat to workers. Respiratory infections, such as 
17
COVID–19, and protective equipment, like essential 
18
face masks, can increase susceptibility to heat ex-
19
haustion and heat stroke. Many of the symptoms of 
20
COVID–19 and heat stress may combine to cause 
21
acute illness that is especially deadly. 
22
(5) Jobs at highest risk of heat stress illness 
23
and death are disproportionately held by Black and 
24
01:07 May 21, 2021
H2193
3 
•HR 2193 IH
Brown workers, a disparity that reflects the racial 
1
injustice inherent in our economic system. 
2
(6) Farmworkers and construction workers suf-
3
fer the highest incidence of heat illness, but all out-
4
door and indoor workers employed in excessively hot 
5
and humid environments are at significant risk of 
6
material impairment of health or functional capacity. 
7
(7) Asuncion Valdivia was a California farm-
8
worker who died of heat stroke in 2004 after picking 
9
grapes for 10 straight hours in 105 degree tempera-
10
tures. Instead of calling an ambulance, his employer 
11
told his son to drive Mr. Valdivia home. On his way 
12
home, he started foaming at the mouth and died. 
13
(8) People working in excessive heat suffer di-
14
minished mental acuity and physical ability, which 
15
increases the risk of accidents. Heat-related injuries 
16
and illnesses increase workers’ compensation costs 
17
and medical expenses. 
18
(9) The costs of lower labor productivity under 
19
rising temperatures is estimated to reach up to 
20
$160,000,000,000 in lost wages per year in the 
21
United States by 2090 according to the 2018 Na-
22
tional Climate Assessment. The drop in productivity 
23
decreases income for employers and workers. Global 
24
gross domestic product losses from heat are pro-
25
01:07 May 21, 2021
H2193
4 
•HR 2193 IH
jected to be greater than 20 percent by the end of 
1
this century. 
2
(10) Every year, thousands of workers become 
3
sick and some die from exposure to heat. Between 
4
1992 and 2017, 815 United States workers died 
5
from heat and almost 70,000 were seriously injured. 
6
These numbers are generally understood to be gross 
7
undercounts because many heat-related illnesses and 
8
deaths are blamed on natural causes. 
9
(11) Workers have a legal right to a safe work-
10
place. The vast majority of heat-related workplace 
11
deaths and illnesses can be prevented by access to 
12
water, rest, and shade. Many employers don’t pro-
13
vide these simple measures for workers according to 
14
the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. 
15
(12) Employers often retaliate against employ-
16
ees if they report or seek assistance due to problems 
17
with heat. Many employees are therefore afraid to 
18
report problems and face increased risk of heat-re-
19
lated illnesses or death. 
20
(13) In the absence of a Federal standard, mul-
21
tiple branches of the United States Armed Forces— 
22
including the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air 
23
Force—have issued heat prevention guidelines, and 
24
several States—California, Washington, and Min-
25
01:07 May 21, 2021
H2193

•HR 2193 IH
nesota—have issued heat prevention standards. The 
1
National Institute for Occupational Safety and 
2
Health (NIOSH) issued criteria for such a standard 
3
in 1972, updating it in 1986 and 2016. 
4
(14) Congress created the Occupational Safety 
5
and Health Administration to ensure safe and 
6
healthful working conditions by setting and enforc-
7
ing standards pursuant to section 6 of the Occupa-
8
tional Safety and Health Act of 1970. Employees 
9
are exposed to grave danger from exposure to exces-
10
sive heat. The Occupational Safety and Health Ad-
11
ministration must develop a standard to protect 
12
workers from the significant risks of heat-related ill-
13
ness and death. 
14
(15) While heat stress is often associated with 
15
outdoor jobs, some indoor workers are also at risk 
16
from dangerously high temperatures. Indoor heat 
17
stress is prevalent in enclosed workplaces without 
18
climate control or adequate ventilation, such as 
19
warehouses and factories, and workplaces with heat- 
20
generating machinery such as steel mills, electrical 
21
utilities, bakeries, commercial kitchens, and laun-
22
dries.
