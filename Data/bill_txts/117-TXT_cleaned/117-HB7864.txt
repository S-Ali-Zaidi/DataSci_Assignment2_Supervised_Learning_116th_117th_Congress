A BILL 
To authorize assistance to train and retain obstetrician-gyne-
cologists and sub-specialists in urogynecology and to help 
improve the quality of care to meet the health care 
needs of women in least developed countries, and for 
other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Physician Education

for Fistula Treatment Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 7864 IH
(1) Obstetric fistula, an abnormal opening be-
1
tween a woman’s genital tract and her urinary tract 
2
or rectum, is a devastating childbirth injury caused 
3
by prolonged, obstructed labor in the absence of 
4
timely and quality medical care. 
5
(2) Worldwide, an estimated 500,000 women 
6
and girls live with obstetric fistula with thousands 
7
more occurring annually. It occurs disproportion-
8
ately 
among 
impoverished, 
vulnerable, 
and 
9
marginalized girls and women. 
10
(3) Women who experience an obstetric fistula 
11
suffer life-shattering consequences including chronic 
12
incontinence, shame, social isolation, poverty, and 
13
physical, mental, and emotional health problems. 
14
(4) Obstetric fistula is a violation of human 
15
rights and an indicator of the failure of health sys-
16
tems to deliver universally accessible, timely, and 
17
quality health care to women and girls who need it. 
18
(5) Obstetric fistula is preventable. Universal 
19
health coverage and universal access to quality care 
20
are essential in ending preventable maternal and 
21
newborn deaths and disabilities, including fistula. 
22
Skilled health personnel at birth, emergency obstet-
23
ric and newborn care, and universal access to mod-

ern contraception are the most effective interven-
1
tions to prevent maternal mortality and fistula. 
2
(6) Safeguarding the rights and dignity of 
3
women and girls and addressing underlying gender 
4
and socioeconomic inequalities and discrimination 
5
which drive obstetric fistula are equally important to 
6
end the condition. 
7
(7) In 2018 and 2020, the United Nations Gen-
8
eral Assembly resolutions on fistula were adopted, 
9
calling for ‘‘Ending fistula within a decade’’. This 
10
represents a turning point in the global fight to 
11
eliminate fistula, as it brings the global objective and 
12
timeline for ending fistula into alignment with 
13
achieving 
the 
Sustainable 
Development 
Goals 
14
(SDGs)/Agenda 2030. The resolutions also call for 
15
an increased focus on social determinants to tackle 
16
the root causes of fistula. 
17
(8) Obstetric fistula can be surgically treated. 
18
The impact of an obstetric fistula-repair surgery is 
19
immediate and women can be reintegrated into soci-
20
ety. There is however a high unmet need for treat-
21
ment and social reintegration of fistula survivors. 
22
(9) The Covid–19 pandemic caused overloaded 
23
health systems and reallocation of human and finan-
24
cial resources with disruptions to services resulting 
25

•HR 7864 IH
in an undermining of the sexual and reproductive 
1
health and rights of women and girls. In 2020, fis-
2
tula repairs were widely halted or slowed down due 
3
to Covid–19, as they were deemed non-urgent and 
4
unsafe during the pandemic. This may result in an 
5
increased backlog of fistula cases. 
6
(10) The United Nations Population Fund 
7
(UNFPA)-led global Campaign to End Fistula, is a 
8
key contributor to promoting the rights, dignity, and 
9
well-being of women and girls. The Campaign fo-
10
cuses on prevention, treatment, social reintegration, 
11
and advocacy. Aimed at ‘‘leaving no one behind’’ and 
12
‘‘reaching the furthest behind’’, it contributes to 
13
achieving the SDGs and has also helped restore 
14
overall health, dignity, hope, and a sense of self- 
15
worth and agency to some of the poorest, most 
16
marginalized women and girls worldwide through its 
17
holistic, gender-sensitive, and rights-based approach 
18
to policies and programs for the elimination of ob-
19
stetric 
fistula 
and 
several 
other 
maternal 
20
morbidities. 
21
(11) UNFPA has supported over 129,000 sur-
22
gical repairs from 2003 through 2021. The Cam-
23
paign to End Fistula and its partners has made re-
24
markable progress, but the needs remain great.

(12) With 8 years to reach the global goal of 
1
ending fistula by 2030, significantly intensified in-
2
vestment, efforts, and partnerships at the inter-
3
national and national levels are required. 
4
(13) The International Day to End Obstetric 
5
Fistula which takes place on May 23, 2022, will be 
6
commemorated this year with the theme: ‘‘End Fis-
7
tula Now: Invest in Quality Healthcare, Empower 
8
Communities!’’, calling for investments to improve 
9
the quality of care and emphasizing the key role of 
10
communities in addressing social, cultural, political, 
11
and economic determinants that impact maternal 
12
health and sexual reproductive health, and reproduc-
13
tive rights.
