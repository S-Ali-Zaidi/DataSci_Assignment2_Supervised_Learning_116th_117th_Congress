SEC. 4. FINDINGS RELATING TO S CORPORATION ESOPs. 
24
Congress finds the following: 
25
16:44 Jun 23, 2021
H2927
9 
•HR 2927 IH
(1) On January 1, 1998, nearly 25 years after 
1
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 
2
1974 was enacted and the employee stock ownership 
3
plan (hereafter in this section referred to as an 
4
‘‘ESOP’’) was created, employees were first per-
5
mitted to be owners of subchapter S corporations 
6
pursuant to the Small Business Job Protection Act 
7
of 1996 (Public Law 104–188). 
8
(2) With the passage of the Taxpayer Relief 
9
Act of 1997 (Public Law 105–34), Congress de-
10
signed incentives to encourage businesses to become 
11
ESOP-owned S corporations. 
12
(3) Since that time, several thousand companies 
13
have become ESOP-owned S corporations, creating 
14
an ownership interest for several million Americans 
15
in companies in every State in the country, in indus-
16
tries ranging from heavy manufacturing to construc-
17
tion and contracting to services. 
18
(4) Every United States worker who is an em-
19
ployee-owner of an S corporation company through 
20
an ESOP has a valuable qualified retirement savings 
21
account. 
22
(5) Recent studies have shown that employees 
23
of ESOP-owned S corporations enjoy greater job 
24
stability, wages and benefits than employees of com-
25

H2927

•HR 2927 IH
parable companies; and ESOP companies are better 
1
able to weather economic downturns. 
2
(6) Studies also show that employee-owners of 
3
S corporation ESOP companies have amassed mean-
4
ingful retirement savings through their ESOP ac-
5
counts that will give them the means to retire with 
6
dignity. 
7
(7) It is the goal of Congress to preserve and 
8
foster employee ownership of S corporations through 
9
ESOPs.
