Whereas teachers exhibited resilience during challenges, 
strength in times of uncertainty, and an unwavering com-
mitment to innovative pedagogical protocols and strate-
gies for emergency deployed remote instruction; 
Whereas teachers are expected to meet the diverse academic, 
social, emotional, and behavioral needs of individual stu-
dents while simultaneously meeting the demands of re-
quired accountability measures, conferencing with par-
ents, and adapting to new programs and initiatives re-
quired by State and local education agencies; 
Whereas teachers are experiencing secondary trauma and 
compassion fatigue; 
Whereas a 2021 survey found that since the start of the pan-
demic, 27 percent of teachers self-reported symptoms 
consistent with clinical depression, 37 percent self-re-
ported symptoms consistent with anxiety disorder, and 19 
percent self-reported increased use of substances to cope 
with stress; 
Whereas a 2021 study found that teachers are almost twice 
as likely to experience frequent job-related stress and 
nearly 3 times as likely to experience symptoms of de-
pression than the general adult population; 
Whereas a 2021 report found that teachers are asking for 
more mental health training and resources, access to on-
site therapeutic resources, and more time to both fulfill 
their professional responsibilities and to focus explicitly 
on their own mental health; 
Whereas a 2022 survey revealed that more than half of 
teachers said they were considering leaving the field or 
retiring more now than they were before the pandemic;

Whereas teacher well-being is often overlooked as a part of 
school health and a component of ensuring academic suc-
cess; and 
Whereas it would be appropriate to observe the week of May 
23 through May 27, 2022, as ‘‘Educator Mental Health 
Awareness Week’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the designation of ‘‘Educator Men-
2
tal Health Awareness Week’’ to acknowledge the ex-
3
periences teachers and staff are facing each day and 
4
to prioritize their mental health; 
5
(2) recognizes every teacher and staff’s well- 
6
being and mental health as important to the health 
7
of students nationwide; 
8
(3) applauds the unity of Federal, State, and 
9
local educational organizations working to promote 
10
public awareness of teacher and staff mental health 
11
and providing critical information and resources dur-
12
ing trying times; and 
13
(4) encourages all to draw on ‘‘Educator Men-
14
tal Health Awareness Week’’ as an opportunity to 
15
promote mental well-being and awareness, not only 
16
for the educators of today, but also for their stu-
17
