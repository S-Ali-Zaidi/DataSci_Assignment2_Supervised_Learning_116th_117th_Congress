RESOLUTION 
Calling on the President to deter further Russian aggression 
against Ukraine, particularly the threat of nuclear, bio-
logical, or chemical attacks. 
Whereas the Russian Federation is currently engaged in a 
brutal, illegal, premeditated, and destructive war against 
the sovereign, democratic country of Ukraine; 
Whereas the Russian Federation’s war against Ukraine is in 
gross, clear, and uncorrected violation of the principles of 
the Helsinki Final Act, in contravention of the United 
Nations Charter, in violation of its obligations under the 
1994 Budapest Memorandum, and an unmitigated moral 
stain on its countenance; 
Whereas the Russian leadership has made numerous implied 
and overt threats regarding the potential use of nuclear,

biological, or chemical weapons of mass destruction in 
connection with its barbaric war on Ukraine; 
Whereas the Russian war on Ukraine is not only a humani-
tarian catastrophe and a global and national security cri-
sis, but also a direct and potentially irreparable threat to 
global nonproliferation, including notorious and gross 
Russian violations of its obligations under the Budapest 
Memorandums and the conduct of a civilized state; 
Whereas, in exchange for Ukraine eliminating all nuclear 
weapons from its territory, the 1994 Budapest Memo-
randum committed its signatories, the Russian Federa-
tion, the United Kingdom, and the United States, to re-
frain from the threat or use of force or economic coercion 
against Ukraine, and provided guarantees for the inde-
pendence and sovereignty and territorial integrity of 
Ukraine; 
Whereas the employment of chemical or biological weapons by 
the Russian Federation would be in violation of its obli-
gations under the Chemical Weapons Convention, the Ge-
neva Protocol, and the Biological Weapons Convention; 
and 
Whereas the United States does not seek war, and urges an 
immediate end to Russian aggression in and against 
Ukraine, but the Russian military’s potential use of nu-
clear, chemical, or biological weapons of mass destruction 
constitutes grave escalation over redlines that imperil 
United States national security and international peace: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) calls upon the President to declare that the

Russian employment of nuclear, chemical, or biologi-

cal weapons of mass destruction (WMDs), including 
1
low-yield ‘‘tactical’’ nuclear weapons, ‘‘false flag’’ op-

erations utilizing WMDs, and the purposeful or de-
3
liberate targeting or neglect of nuclear facilities that 
4
leads to a nuclear event, against or in connection 
5
with its war on Ukraine would represent crimes

against humanity; 
7
(2) calls upon the President to treat such 
8
crimes against humanity as an urgent national and 
9
global security threat that may require, in concert 
10
with North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies, the 
11
employment of any available conventional means as 
12
necessary to secure the peace, including the potential 
13
need to degrade and destroy offending Russian 
14
forces in Ukraine; 
15
(3) calls upon the President to make immediate 
16
efforts to provide the military and other material 
17
means needed for the legitimate democratic Govern-
18
ment of Ukraine to be able to defend its national 
19
sovereignty; and

(4) stands ready to make additional appropria-
21
tions or legislation to meet the needs of securing

Ukraine’s, Europe’s, and the United States common

struggle against Russian fascism.
