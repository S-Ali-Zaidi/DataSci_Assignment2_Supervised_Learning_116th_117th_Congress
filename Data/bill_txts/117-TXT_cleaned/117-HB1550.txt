•HR 1550 IH
(1) The human papillomavirus (referred to in 
1
this Act as ‘‘HPV’’) causes six different types of 
2
cancer (anal, cervical, oropharynx, penile, vaginal, 
3
and vulvar). 
4
(2) Almost 35,000 cases of cancer are caused 
5
by HPV each year impacting both women and men. 
6
(3) About 90 percent of cervical and anal can-
7
cers are thought to be caused by HPV. 
8
(4) Black and Hispanic women are more likely 
9
to get HPV-associated cervical cancer than women 
10
of other races and ethnicities. 
11
(5) Approximately 60 to 70 percent of 
12
oropharynx cancer is tied to HPV. 
13
(6) Most HPV infections that can lead to can-
14
cer can be prevented by vaccines. 
15
(7) HPV vaccines can also help prevent recur-
16
rent respiratory papillomatosis, anal and genital 
17
warts. 
18
(8) Vaccination for HPV is approved for men 
19
and women. 
20

21
tered when an individual is between the ages of 9 
22
and 12.

24
pleted the HPV vaccine series.
