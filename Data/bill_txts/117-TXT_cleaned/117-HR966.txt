use the voice, vote, and influence of the United States 
to immediately promote the establishment of an appro-
priate regional or international justice mechanism to in-
vestigate and prosecute possible international crimes

further calling upon the President to convoke and con-
vene the world’s democracies for the purposes of estab-
lishing such an international justice mechanism at the 
earliest possible time, and for other purposes. 
Whereas Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter (‘‘UN 
Charter’’) states that ‘‘All Members shall refrain in their

ber 8, 1991, the Soviet Union was dissolved by the 
Belovezh Accords and Ukraine was recognized as inde-
pendent; 
Whereas the United States recognized the independence of 
Ukraine on Christmas Day, 1991; 
Whereas both Ukraine and the Russian Federation are suc-
cessor states to the Ukrainian SSR and the Soviet Union 
that signed the UN Charter; 
Whereas, on December 5, 1994, the Russian Federation 
signed the Budapest Memorandum, in which Russia 
agreed to: ‘‘respect the Independence and Sovereignty 
and the existing borders of Ukraine . . . refrain from the 
threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or 
political independence of Ukraine, and that none of their 
weapons will ever be used against Ukraine except in self- 
defense or otherwise in accordance with the Charter of 
the United Nations . . . [and] to refrain from economic 
coercion designed to subordinate to their own interest the 
exercise by Ukraine of the rights inherent in its sov-
ereignty and thus to secure advantages of any kind.’’; 
Whereas, in February and March 2014, the Russian Federa-
tion military entered and occupied the Crimean region of 
Ukraine, the Ukrainian Autonomous Republic of Crimea, 
ejected the legitimate Ukrainian authorities, annexed the 
region to the Russian Federation, and subsequently sus-
tained a brutal campaign of repression against Crimean 
Tatars, ethnic Ukrainians, and members of other minor-
ity ethnic and religious groups in the Ukrainian Autono-
mous Republic of Crimea, initiating a period of conflict

Whereas, on February 12, 2015, the Russian Federation 
signed the Minsk Agreement in which Russia agreed, 
inter alia, to ‘‘An immediate and comprehensive ceasefire 
in individual areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions 
of Ukraine . . . withdrawal of all heavy weapons by both 
parties . . . Restoration of full control over the state bor-
der of Ukraine by Ukraine’s government throughout the 
whole conflict area . . . [and] withdrawal of all foreign 
armed forces, military equipment, as well as mercenaries 
from the territory of Ukraine’’; 
Whereas the Russian Federation has failed to meet its obliga-
tions under the Minsk Agreement, and a state of conflict 
persisted until this year in the Donbas region; 
Whereas, on February 21, 2022, Russian Federation Presi-
dent Vladimir Putin, alone among UN Member States, 
contrary to international law, and contrary to Russia’s

eastern Ukrainian oblasts in the Donbas region as inde-
pendent states, which he called the Donetsk People’s Re-
public and the Luhansk People’s Republic; 
Whereas, following Russian Federation President Vladimir 
Putin’s illegal February 21, 2022, recognition of the 
independence of the Ukrainian oblasts of Donetsk and

occupy these oblasts;

Whereas these and other actions perpetrated by the Russian 
Federation and all other national groups may constitute 
international crimes, to include the crime of aggression; 
Whereas, on February 24, 2022, contrary to Russian Federa-
tion President Vladimir Putin’s commitments under the

oblasts of Donetsk, Luhansk, the occupied Ukrainian Au-
tonomous Republic of Crimea, and the country of 
Belarus; 
Whereas, on February 20, 2022, the Washington Post re-
ported that United States Representative to the Office of 
the United Nations and Other International Organiza-
tions in Geneva, Ambassador Bathsheba Nell Crocker, in-
formed UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, 
Michelle Bachelet, that the United States has ‘‘credible 
information that indicates Russian forces are creating 
lists of identified Ukrainians to be killed or sent to camps 
following a military occupation . . .’’ and ‘‘. . . credible 
information that Russian forces will likely use lethal 
measures to disperse peaceful protests or otherwise 
counter peaceful exercises of perceived resistance from ci-
vilian populations. . . .’’; 
Whereas, on February 27, 2022, Russian Federation Presi-
dent Vladimir Putin publicly put his strategic nuclear 
forces on alert, thus exponentially escalating the serious-
ness of his invasion of Ukraine, and implicitly threat-
ening NATO countries and others with nuclear annihila-
tion; 
Whereas the Russian Federation is a permanent member of 
the United Nations Security Council, with veto power;

•HRES 966 IH 
Whereas the international community has previously estab-
lished ad hoc tribunals and special courts and other jus-
tice mechanisms through the United Nations to bring 
justice in specific countries where there have been war 
crimes; 
Whereas various tribunals, including the International Crimi-
nal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, the International 
Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, and the Special Court for 
Sierra Leone, have successfully investigated and pros-
ecuted war crimes, and there are many positive lessons 
to be learned from these three ad hoc tribunals; 
Whereas the crime of aggression is an international crime 
and recognized as such by most nations of the world; and 
Whereas, if the United Nations is unwilling or unable to act, 
the world’s democracies have an interest in seeing ac-
countability for international crimes, to include the crime 
of aggression committed against a fellow democracy: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-

(1) the United States should urge the Govern-
3
ments of the Russian Federation, Ukraine, and

other groups involved in the war in Ukraine to im-

tiations to end the bloodshed, while demanding that

12
and other crimes against Ukraine, and to prosecute 
13
the perpetrators of such serious crimes committed 
14
during the period of conflict in Ukraine; 
15
(4) in the event that the United Nations is un-
16
able or unwilling to establish a tribunal for Russian 
17
war crimes and other crimes against Ukraine, the

19
democracies for the purposes of establishing such a

this regional or international justice mechanism for

Russian war crimes and other crimes against

ners in this effort to develop judicial procedures that 
1
enable the fair and open prosecution of those per-
2
sons guilty of perpetrating such serious crimes; 
3
(6) the United States should encourage, sup-
4
port, and collect any and all information that can be

supplied to an appropriate regional or international

justice mechanism for Russian war crimes and other 
7
crimes against Ukraine for use as evidence to sup-

port the indictment and trial of any persons respon-

sible for international crimes to include the crime of

aggression in Ukraine an immediate priority; and

(7) the United States should urge all other in-

custody of an appropriate regional or justice mecha-
14
nism for Russian war crimes and other crimes 
15
against Ukraine persons indicted for international

crimes and urge all interested states to provide any

and all data and information pertaining to such
