SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) GENERAL FINDINGS.— 
3
(A) 
Consumer 
reporting 
agencies 
4
(‘‘CRAs’’) are companies that collect, compile, 
5
and provide information about consumers in the 
6
form of consumer reports for certain permis-
7
sible statutory purposes under the Fair Credit 
8
Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.) 
9
(‘‘FCRA’’). The three largest CRAs in this 
10
country 
are 
Equifax, 
TransUnion, 
and 
11
Experian. These CRAs are referred to as na-
12
22:32 Jul 22, 2021
H4113

•HR 4113 IH
tionwide CRAs and the reports that they pre-
1
pare are commonly referred to as credit reports. 
2
Furnishers, such as creditors, lenders, and debt 
3
collection agencies, voluntarily submit informa-
4
tion to CRAs about their accounts such as the 
5
total amount for each loan or credit limit for 
6
each credit card and the consumer’s payment 
7
history on these products. Reports also include 
8
identifying information about a consumer, such 
9
as their birthdate, previous mailing addresses, 
10
and current and previous employers. 
11
(B) In a December 2012 paper, ‘‘Key Di-
12
mensions and Processes in the U.S. Credit Re-
13
porting System: A review for how the nation’s 
14
largest credit bureaus manage consumer data’’, 
15
the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection 
16
(‘‘Consumer Bureau’’) noted that the three na-
17
tionwide CRAs maintain credit files on approxi-
18
mately 200 million adults and receive informa-
19
tion from about 10,000 furnishers. On a 
20
monthly basis, these furnishers provide infor-
21
mation on over 1.3 billion consumer credit ac-
22
counts or other trade lines. 
23
(C) The 10 largest institutions furnishing 
24
credit information to each of the nationwide 
25
22:32 Jul 22, 2021
H4113
4 
•HR 4113 IH
CRAs account for more than half of all ac-
1
counts reflected in consumers’ credit files. 
2
(D) Consumer reports play an increasingly 
3
important role in the lives of American con-
4
sumers. Most creditors, for example, review 
5
these reports to make decisions about whether 
6
to extend credit to consumers and what terms 
7
and conditions to offer them. As such, informa-
8
tion contained in these reports affects whether 
9
a person is able to get a private education loan 
10
to pay for college costs, to secure a mortgage 
11
loan to buy a home, or to obtain a credit card, 
12
as well as the terms and conditions under which 
13
consumer credit products or services are offered 
14
to them. 
15
(E) Credit reports are also increasingly 
16
used for many noncredit decisions, including by 
17
landlords to determine whether to rent an 
18
apartment to a prospective tenant and by em-
19
ployers to decide whether to hire potential job 
20
applicants or to offer a promotion to existing 
21
employees. 
22
(F) CRAs have a statutory obligation to 
23
verify independently the accuracy and complete-
24
22:32 Jul 22, 2021
H4113
5 
•HR 4113 IH
ness of information included on the reports that 
1
they provide. 
2
(G) The nationwide CRAs have failed to 
3
establish and follow reasonable procedures, as 
4
required by existing law, to establish the max-
5
imum level of accuracy of information contained 
6
on consumer reports. Given the repeated fail-
7
ures of these CRAs to comply with accuracy re-
8
quirements on their own, legislation is intended 
9
to provide them with detailed guidance improv-
10
ing the accuracy and completeness of informa-
11
tion contained in consumer reports, including 
12
procedures, policies, and practices that these 
13
CRAs should already be following to ensure full 
14
compliance with their existing obligations. 
15
(H) The presence of inaccurate or incom-
16
plete information on these reports can result in 
17
substantial financial and emotional harm to 
18
consumers. Credit reporting errors can lead to 
19
the loss of a new employment opportunity or a 
20
denial of a promotion in an existing job, stop 
21
someone from being able to access credit on fa-
22
vorable terms, prevent a person from obtaining 
23
rental housing, or even trigger mental distress. 
24
22:32 Jul 22, 2021

•HR 4113 IH
(I) Current industry practices impose an 
1
unfair burden of proof on consumers trying to 
2
fix errors on their reports. 
3
(J) Consumer reports containing inac-
4
curate or incomplete credit information also un-
5
dermine the ability of creditors and lenders to 
6
effectively and accurately underwrite and price 
7
credit. 
8
(K) Recognizing that credit reporting af-
9
fects the lives of almost all consumers in this 
10
country and that the consequences of errors on 
11
a consumer report can be catastrophic for a 
12
consumer, the Consumer Bureau began accept-
13
ing consumer complaints about credit reporting 
14
in October 2012. 
15
(L) As of February 2017, the Consumer 
16
Bureau has handled approximately 185,717 
17
credit reporting complaints, making credit re-
18
porting consistently the third most-complained- 
19
about subject matter on which the Consumer 
20
Bureau accepts consumer complaints. 
21
(M) In the ‘‘Monthly Complaint Report 
22
Volume 20’’, released in February 2017, the 
23
Consumer Bureau noted that 76 percent of 
24
credit reporting complaints involved incorrect 
25

•HR 4113 IH
information on reports, with consumers fre-
1
quently expressing their frustrations about the 
2
burdensome and time-consuming process to dis-
3
puting items. 
4
(N) Other common types of credit report-
5
ing complaints submitted to the Consumer Bu-
6
reau related to the improper use of a report, 
7
trouble obtaining a report or credit score, 
8
CRAs’ investigations, and credit monitoring or 
9
identity protection. 
10
(O) In the summer 2015 ‘‘Supervisory 
11
Highlights’’, the Consumer Bureau noted that 
12
one or more of the largest CRAs failed to ade-
13
quately oversee furnishers to ensure that they 
14
were adhering to the CRA’s vetting policies and 
15
to establish proper procedures to verify public 
16
record information. 
17
(P) According to the fall 2016 ‘‘Super-
18
visory Highlights’’, Consumer Bureau exam-
19
iners determined that one or more debt collec-
20
tors never investigated indirect disputes that 
21
lacked detail or were not accompanied by at-
22
tachments with relevant information from the 
23
consumer. Examiners also found that notifica-
24
tions sent to consumers about disputes consid-
25
22:32 Jul 22, 2021
H4113
8 
•HR 4113 IH
ered frivolous failed to identify for the con-
1
sumers the type of material that they could pro-
2
vide in order for the debt collector to complete 
3
the investigation of the disputed item. 
4
(Q) A February 2014 Consumer Bureau 
5
report titled ‘‘Credit Reporting Complaint 
6
Snapshot’’ found that consumers are confused 
7
about the extent to which the nationwide CRAs 
8
are required to provide them with validation 
9
and documentation of a debt that appears on 
10
their credit report. 
11
(R) As evidence that the current system 
12
lacks sufficient market incentives for CRAs to 
13
develop more robust procedures to increase the 
14
accuracy and completeness of information on 
15
credit reports, litigation discovery documented 
16
by 
the 
National 
Consumer 
Law 
Center 
17
(‘‘NCLC’’), as part of a January 2009 report 
18
titled, ‘‘Automated Injustice: How a Mecha-
19
nized Dispute System Frustrates Consumers 
20
Seeking to Fix Errors in Their Credit Re-
21
ports’’, showed that at least two of the three 
22
largest CRAs use quota systems to force em-
23
ployees to process disputes hastily and without 
24
the opportunity for conducting meaningful in-
25
22:32 Jul 22, 2021
H4113
9 
•HR 4113 IH
vestigations. At least one nationwide CRA only 
1
allowed dispute resolution staff five minutes to 
2
handle a consumer’s call. Furthermore, these 
3
CRAs were found to have awarded bonuses for 
4
meeting quotas and punished those who didn’t 
5
meet production numbers with probation. 
6
(S) Unlike most other business relation-
7
ships, where consumers can register their satis-
8
faction or unhappiness with a particular credit 
9
product or service simply by taking their busi-
10
ness elsewhere, consumers have no say in 
11
whether their information is included in the 
12
CRAs databases and limited legal remedies to 
13
hold the CRAs accountable for inaccuracies or 
14
poor service. 
15
(T) Accordingly, despite the existing statu-
16
tory mandate for CRAs to follow reasonable 
17
procedures to assure the maximum possible ac-
18
curacy of the information whenever they pre-
19
pare consumer reports, numerous studies, the 
20
high volume of consumer complaints submitted 
21
to the Consumer Bureau about incorrect infor-
22
mation on consumer reports, and supervisory 
23
activities by the Consumer Bureau demonstrate 
24
22:32 Jul 22, 2021
H4113
10 
•HR 4113 IH
that CRAs continue to skirt their obligations 
1
under the law.

(2) INCORRECT
INFORMATION
ON
CONSUMER 
3
REPORTS.— 
4
(A) Consumers are entitled to dispute er-
5
rors on their consumer reports with either the 
6
CRA, who issued the report, or directly with 
7
furnishers, who supplied the account informa-
8
tion to the CRA, and request that mistakes be 
9
deleted or removed. Consumers, who believe an 
10
investigation has not correctly resolved their 
11
dispute, however, have few options, other than 
12
requesting that a statement about the dispute 
13
be included with their future reports. 
14
(B) CRAs have a statutory obligation 
15
under the FCRA to perform a reasonable inves-
16
tigation by conducting a substantive and 
17
searching inquiry when a consumer disputes an 
18
item on their report. In doing so, CRAs must 
19
conduct an independent review about the accu-
20
racy of any disputed item and cannot merely 
21
rely 
on 
a 
furnisher’s 
‘‘rubber-stamp’’ 
22
verification of the integrity of the information 
23
they have provided to CRAs. 
24

•HR 4113 IH
(C) 
The 
Federal 
Trade 
Commission 
1
(‘‘FTC’’), in a ‘‘Report to Congress Under Sec-
2
tion 319 of the Fair and Accurate Credit 
3
Transactions Act of 2003’’ released in Decem-
4
ber 2012, found that 26 percent of survey par-
5
ticipants identified at least one potentially ma-
6
terial error on their consumer reports, and 13 
7
percent experienced a change in their credit 
8
score once the error was fixed. 
9
(D) Consumer Bureau examiners have 
10
identified repeated deficiencies with the nation-
11
wide CRAs’ information collection. In the sum-
12
mer 2015 ‘‘Supervisory Highlights’’ released in 
13
June 2015, the Consumer Bureau noted contin-
14
ued weaknesses with CRAs’ methods and proc-
15
esses for assuring maximum possible accuracy 
16
in their reports. Examiners also found, with 
17
certain exceptions, no quality control policies 
18
and procedures in place to test consumer re-
19
ports for accuracy. 
20
(E) In its ‘‘Credit Reporting Complaint 
21
Snapshot’’ released in February 2014, the Con-
22
sumer Bureau found that consumers were un-
23
certain about the depth and validity of the in-
24
vestigations performed about a disputed item. 
25
22:32 Jul 22, 2021
H4113
12 
•HR 4113 IH
Consumers also expressed frustration that, even 
1
though they provided supporting materials that 
2
they believed demonstrated the inaccuracy of 
3
the information provided by furnishers, errors 
4
continued to remain on their reports. 
5
(F) In the winter 2015 ‘‘Supervisory High-
6
lights’’ released in March 2015, the Consumer 
7
Bureau reported that one or more nationwide 
8
CRAs failed to adequately fulfill their dispute- 
9
handling obligations, including by not for-
10
warding to furnishers all relevant information 
11
found in letters and supporting documents sup-
12
plied by consumers when they submitted dis-
13
putes failing to notify consumers that they had 
14
completed investigations, and not providing con-
15
sumers with the results of the CRAs’ reviews 
16
about their disputes. 
17
(G) Consumer Bureau examiners also 
18
noted in the fall 2016 ‘‘Supervisory Highlights’’ 
19
released in October 2016 that one or more enti-
20
ties failed to provide adequate guidance and 
21
training to staff about how to differentiate 
22
FCRA disputes from general customer inquir-
23
ies, complaints, or debt validation requests. 
24
Consumer Bureau supervisors also directed one

•HR 4113 IH
or more entities to develop and implement rea-
1
sonable procedures to ensure that direct and in-
2
direct disputes are appropriately logged, cat-
3
egorized, and resolved. 
4
(H) Consumers’ increasing frustration 
5
about the difficulties of trying to fix credit re-
6
porting errors, evidenced through the volume of 
7
consumer complaints related to errors sub-
8
mitted to the Consumer Bureau, are also 
9
echoed in another FTC study issued in January 
10
2015. In the ‘‘Report to Congress under Sec-
11
tion 319 for the Fair and Accurate Credit 
12
Transactions Act of 2003’’, the FTC found that 
13
nearly 70 percent (84 people) of participants 
14
from a previous survey that had filed disputes 
15
with CRAs continued to believe that at least 
16
some of the disputed information remained in-
17
accurate at the time of the follow-up survey. 
18
Despite these views, 50 percent (42 people) of 
19
the survey participants decided to just give up 
20
trying to fix the errors, with only 45 percent 
21
(38 people) of them planning to continue to try 
22
to resolve their disputes. 
23
(I) The consistently high volume of con-
24
sumer complaints submitted to the Consumer

H4113
14 
•HR 4113 IH
Bureau about credit reporting errors, coupled 
1
with the largest CRAs’ repeated quality control 
2
weaknesses found by Consumer Bureau exam-
3
iners, show that the nationwide CRAs have 
4
failed to establish and follow reasonable proce-
5
dures to assure maximum accuracy of informa-
6
tion and to conduct independent investigations 
7
of consumers’ disputes. These ongoing problems 
8
demonstrate the need for legislation to— 
9
(i) enhance obligations on furnishers 
10
to substantiate information and require 
11
furnishers to keep records for the same 
12
amount of time that adverse information 
13
about these accounts may appear on a per-
14
son’s consumer report; 
15
(ii) eliminate CRAs’ discretion to de-
16
termine the relevancy of materials provided 
17
by consumers to support their dispute 
18
claims by instead requiring them to pass 
19
all material onto furnishers and elimi-
20
nating CRA’s discretion to deem some dis-
21
putes frivolous or irrelevant when a con-
22
sumer resubmits a claim that they believe 
23
has been inadequately resolved; 
24
22:32 Jul 22, 2021
H4113
15 
•HR 4113 IH
(iii) enhance educational content on 
1
CRAs’ websites to improve consumers’ un-
2
derstanding of the dispute process and to 
3
make it easier for all consumers to initiate 
4
claims, including by providing these disclo-
5
sures in other languages besides English; 
6
and 
7
(iv) create a new consumer right to 
8
appeal reviews by CRAs and furnishers of 
9
the initial disputes. 
10
(3) INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.— 
11
(A) Despite the fact that the FCRA cur-
12
rently provides implicit authority for injunctive 
13
relief, consumers have been prevented from ex-
14
ercising this right. Legislation explicitly clari-
15
fying this right is intended to underscore con-
16
gressional intent that injunctive relief should be 
17
viewed as a remedy available to consumers. 
18
(B) Myriad findings by the courts, regu-
19
lators, consumers, and consumer advocates 
20
make clear that CRAs have failed to establish 
21
adequate standards for the accuracy and com-
22
pleteness of consumer reports, yet the nation-
23
wide CRAs have demonstrated little willingness 
24
22:32 Jul 22, 2021
H4113
16 
•HR 4113 IH
to voluntarily retool their policies and proce-
1
dures to fix the problems. 
2
(C) Providing courts with explicit authority 
3
to issue injunctive relief, by telling the CRAs to 
4
remedy unlawful practices and procedures, 
5
would further CRAs’ mandate under the FCRA 
6
to assure the maximum possible accuracy and 
7
completeness of information contained on credit 
8
reports. 
9
(D) Absent explicit authority to issue in-
10
junctions, history suggests that the nationwide 
11
CRAs are likely to continue conducting business 
12
as usual in treating any monetary settlements 
13
with individual consumers and fines imposed by 
14
State attorneys general and Federal regulators, 
15
simply as the ‘‘cost of doing business’’. 
16
(4) DECEPTIVE AND MISLEADING MARKETING 
17
PRACTICES.— 
18
(A) The Consumer Bureau’s February 
19
2015 report titled ‘‘Consumer Voices on Credit 
20
Reports and Scores’’ found that some con-
21
sumers did not obtain a copy of their consumer 
22
report due to concerns about security or of 
23
being trapped into purchasing unwanted prod-
24
22:32 Jul 22, 2021
H4113
17 
•HR 4113 IH
ucts like an additional report or a credit moni-
1
toring service. 
2
(B) In January 2017, the Consumer Bu-
3
reau fined TransUnion and Equifax for decep-
4
tively marketing credit scores for purchase by 
5
consumers as the same credit scores typically 
6
used by lenders to determine creditworthiness 
7
and for luring consumers into costly subscrip-
8
tion services that were advertised as ‘‘free’’ or 
9
‘‘$1’’ that automatically charged recurring fees 
10
unless cancelled by consumers. The Consumer 
11
Bureau also found that Equifax was illegally 
12
advertising its products on webpages that con-
13
sumers 
accessed 
through 
14
AnnualCreditReport.com before consumers ob-
15
tained their free disclosures. Because of these 
16
troubling practices, TransUnion was ordered to 
17
pay $13.9 million in restitution to harmed con-
18
sumers and a civil penalty of $3 million to the 
19
Consumer Bureau. Equifax was ordered to pay 
20
more than $3.7 million to affected consumers 
21
as well as a civil money penalty of $2.5 million 
22
to the Consumer Bureau. As part of the con-
23
sent orders, the CRAs are also supposed to 
24
change the way that they sell their products to 
25
22:32 Jul 22, 2021
H4113
18 
•HR 4113 IH
consumers. The CRAs must also obtain con-
1
sumers’ express consent before enrolling them 
2
into subscription services as well as make it 
3
easer for consumers to cancel these programs. 
4
(C) The Consumer Bureau fined the other 
5
nationwide CRA—Experian—in March 2017 
6
for deceiving consumers about the use of credit 
7
scores that it marketed and sold to consumers 
8
as credit scores that were used by lenders and 
9
for illegally advertising its products on web 
10
pages 
that 
consumers 
accessed 
through 
11
AnnualCreditReport.com before they obtained 
12
their free annual disclosures. Experian was or-
13
dered to pay more than $3.7 million in restitu-
14
tion to harmed consumers and a civil monetary 
15
penalty of $2.5 million to the Consumer Bu-
16
reau. 
17
(D) The Consumer Bureau’s January and 
18
March 2017 consent orders with the three na-
19
tionwide CRAs show that these CRAs have en-
20
ticed consumers into purchasing products and 
21
services that they may not want or need, in 
22
some instances by advertising products or serv-
23
ices ‘‘free’’ that automatically converted into an 
24
ongoing subscription service at the regular price 
25
22:32 Jul 22, 2021
H4113
19 
•HR 4113 IH
unless cancelled by the consumer. Although 
1
these CRAs must now change their deceptive 
2
marketing practices, codifying these duties is an 
3
appropriate way to ensure that these companies 
4
never revert back to such misleading tactics. 
5
(E) Given the ubiquitous use of consumer 
6
reports in consumers’ lives and the fact that 
7
consumers’ participation in the credit reporting 
8
system is involuntary, CRAs should also 
9
prioritize providing consumers with the effective 
10
means to safeguard their personal and financial 
11
information and improve their credit standing, 
12
rather than seeking to exploit consumers’ con-
13
cerns and confusion about credit reporting and 
14
scoring, to boost their companies’ profits. 
15
(F) Vulnerable consumers, who have legiti-
16
