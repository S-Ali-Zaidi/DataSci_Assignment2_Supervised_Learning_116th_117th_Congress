SEC. 4. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS. 
1
It is the sense of the Congress that— 
2
(1) the right of the people to keep and bear 
3
arms is a fundamental component of self-govern-
4
ment, self-defense, and the preservation of individual 
5
liberty; 
6
(2) deprivation of the constitutional right to 
7
bear arms requires due process under the Fifth and 
8
Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the 
9
United States; 
10
(3) ignoring appeals of determinations made by 
11
the National Instant Criminal Background Check 
12
System (NICS) violates due process; and 
13
(4) NICS should have the burden of showing a 
14
valid reason for the denial of this constitutional 
15
right.
