SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Benjamin Berell 
2
Ferencz Congressional Gold Medal Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) Benjamin ‘‘Ben’’ Berell Ferencz was born 
6
on March 11, 1920, in Transylvania, now modern 
7
day Hungary. 
8
(2) In 1920, Ben and his family fled anti-Se-
9
mitic persecution and emigrated to the United 
10
States. Ben grew up in New York City, and in 1940, 
11
was awarded a scholarship to Harvard Law School 
12
where he graduated with honors. 
13
(3) After the onset of World War II, Ben en-
14
listed in the United States Army in 1943, and joined 
15
an anti-aircraft artillery battalion preparing for the 
16
invasion of France. As an enlisted man under Gen-
17
eral Patton, he fought in most of the major cam-
18
paigns in Europe. 
19
(4) As Nazi atrocities were uncovered, Ben was 
20
transferred to a newly created War Crimes Branch 
21
of the Army to gather evidence of war crimes that 
22
could be used in a court of law to prosecute persons 
23
responsible for these crimes. Ben documented the 
24
horrors perpetrated by Nazi Germany, visiting con-
25
centration camps as they were liberated.

(5) At the end of 1945, Ben was honorably dis-
1
charged from the United States Army with the rank 
2
of Sergeant of Infantry. He had been awarded five 
3
battle stars. 
4
(6) In 1946, the United States Government re-
5
cruited Ben to join the team working on the Nurem-
6
berg tribunals, a novel independent court established 
7
to try top-ranking Nazi officials for crimes per-
8
petrated during the course of the war, including 
9
those crimes we now call the Holocaust. Mr. Ferencz 
10
was sent to Berlin to oversee a team of 50 research-
11
ers investigating official Nazi records, which pro-
12
vided overwhelming evidence to implicate German 
13
doctors, lawyers, judges, generals, industrialists, and 
14
others in genocide. 
15
(7) By 1948, at age 27, Ben had secured 
16
enough evidence to prosecute 22 SS members of 
17
Nazi killing squads charged for the murder of over 
18
1,000,0000 Jewish, Roma, Soviet, and other men, 
19
women, and children in shooting massacres in occu-
20
pied Soviet territory. He was appointed chief pros-
21
ecutor in the Einsatzgruppen Trial, in what the As-
22
sociated Press called ‘‘the biggest murder trial in 
23
history’’. The court found 20 Nazi officials guilty of 
24
war crimes, crimes against humanity, and member-

ship in a criminal organization for their roles in the 
1
murder of over a million people. An additional two 
2
defendants were found guilty for membership in a 
3
criminal organization. 
4
(8) After the Nuremberg trials ended, Ben 
5
fought for compensation for victims and survivors of 
6
the Holocaust, the return of stolen assets, and other 
7
forms of restitution for those who had suffered at 
8
the hands of the Nazis. 
9
(9) Since the 1970s, Ben has worked tirelessly 
10
to promote development of international mechanisms 
11
to outlaw and punish aggressive war and the crimes 
12
of genocide, crimes against humanity and war 
13
crimes. His efforts contributed to the establishment 
14
of the International Criminal Court and to the rec-
15
ognition of aggression as an international crime. 
16
(10) Ben is a tireless advocate for international 
17
criminal justice and the conviction that the rule of 
18
law offers the world a sustainable path to stem con-
19
flict and reach peaceful conclusions to geopolitical 
20
disputes. His unwavering goal has been ‘‘to establish 
21
a legal precedent that would encourage a more hu-
22
mane and secure world in the future’’. 
23
(11) Ben, at age 101, is still active, giving 
24
speeches throughout the world about lessons learned 
25

during his extraordinary career. He is compelled by 
1
the imperative to ‘‘replace the rule of force with the 
2
rule of law’’, promoting judicial mechanisms that 
3
can resolve conflict. He often tells young people to 
4
‘‘never give up’’ because the fight for peace and jus-
5
tice is worth the long struggle ahead.
