SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) On July 4, 1776, the Second Continental 
3
Congress unanimously declared the independence of 
4
the 13 colonies, and the achievement of peace was 
5
recognized as one of the highest duties of the new 
6
organization of free and independent States by de-
7
claring, ‘‘We hold these truths to be self-evident, 
8
that all men are created equal, that they are en-
9
dowed by their Creator with certain unalienable 
10
Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the 
11
pursuit of Happiness.’’. 
12
(2) The Constitution of the United States, in 
13
its preamble, further sets forth the insurance of the 
14
cause of peace in stating, ‘‘We the People of the 
15
United States, in Order to form a more perfect 
16
Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tran-

quility, provide for the common defence, promote the 
1
general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty 
2
to ourselves and our Posterity’’. 
3
(3) The United States has been at peace for 
4
only 21 entire years since its birth during the Revo-
5
lutionary War. During the course of the 20th cen-
6
tury, more than 100,000,000 people perished in 
7
wars. Many of our citizens today have never known 
8
a peaceful year in their lifetimes. 
9
(4) Thus far in the 21st century, nearly 
10
1,000,000 people have died in conflict and war. The 
11
United Nations reports that as of 2019 over 79.6 
12
million people have fled their homes due to war, per-
13
secution and conflict. Since late 2001, the United 
14
States appropriated and was obligated to spend an 
15
estimated $6.4 trillion through Fiscal Year 2020 in 
16
budgetary costs related to and caused by post 9/11 
17
wars and an additional minimum of $1 trillion to 
18
care for veterans of these wars for several decades. 
19
(5) The physical, emotional, monetary, and 
20
other costs of violence are enormous, cut across all 
21
sectors of society in the United States, dispropor-
22
tionately impact people of color, and are inter-
23
related. A World Health Organization report esti-
24
mates that interpersonal violence within the United 
25
22:34 Mar 12, 2021

•HR 1111 IH
States costs approximately $300 billion annually, not 
1
including war-related costs. The Centers for Disease 
2
Control and Prevention reports one in four children 
3
experience some form of child abuse or neglect in 
4
their lifetimes; nearly one in four women report hav-
5
ing experienced severe physical violence from an inti-
6
mate partner; Native American women are sexually 
7
assaulted, murdered and disappeared at higher rates 
8
than other American women. There are 3.3 million 
9
reports of violence against children that result in 
10
foster care placements every year; 25 percent of kids 
11
in foster care experience PTSD, fewer than 3 per-
12
cent earn a college degree; 20 percent become home-
13
less after the age of 18; and only 50 percent will be 
14
employed by the age of 24. One in five high school 
15
students reported being bullied at school during 
16
2017 and cyberbullying impacts many young people. 
17
Criminalization disproportionately impacts African 
18
Americans and other people of color, including high 
19
rates of school suspensions and expulsions and in-
20
carceration. African Americans are incarcerated at 
21
more than five times the rate of Whites. Suicide im-
22
pacts young people in both affluent and non-affluent 
23
communities. In 2015, 17 percent of students con-
24
sidered attempting suicide. Suicide is the second

leading cause of death among American Indian and 
1
Alaska Natives aged 10 to 34. Approximately 20 
2
veterans a day commit suicide nationwide. About 14 
3
young people die from homicides each day. Research 
4
shows victims of one form of violence are more likely 
5
to experience other forms of violence. A past history 
6
of violence, including domestic violence; use of alco-
7
hol or illegal drugs; being young and male; or a per-
8
sonal history of physical or sexual abuse or trauma, 
9
increases the risk of more violence, obesity, high-risk 
10
sexual behavior, depression, academic difficulties, 
11
school dropout and suicide. 
12
(6) More people have died from guns in the 
13
United States since 1968 than on battlefields of all 
14
the wars in United States history. Every year 
15
250,000 people are killed by gun violence around the 
16
world, a third of those in Brazil and the United 
17
States. Firearms are the second leading cause of 
18
death for American children and teens and the first 
19
leading cause of death for Black children and teens. 
20
Every day 47 children and teens in the United 
21
States are shot and 96 Americans are killed by gun 
22
violence. During 2017 and 2018, there was one mass 
23
shooting almost every day in the United States.

3
(7) According to a report by the Institute of 
4
Economics and Peace, which measures the economic 
5
impact of violence and conflict to the global econ-
6
omy, the economic impact of violence to the global 
7
economy was $14.76 trillion in 2017. The report 
8
also found that the regional impact of violence in 
9
North America, 99 percent of which can be attrib-
10
uted to the United States, amounted to $2.73 tril-
11
lion in 2017. If violence containment spending was 
12
reduced by 15 percent, the world would save $1.4 
13
trillion, which would be the funding required to 
14
achieve the United Nations Millennium Development 
15
Goals of halving extreme poverty rates, ensuring 
16
healthy lives for all, halting the spread of HIV and 
17
AIDS, providing universal primary education, decent 
18
jobs, gender equality, promoting peaceful, inclusive 
19
and just societies, and more. Three percent of 
20
United States military spending could end starvation 
21
on earth. 
22
(8) Peace is the essential prerequisite for the 
23
survival of humanity as we know it in the 21st cen-
24
tury. Preventing violence and redirecting funds spent

•HR 1111 IH
on the costs of violence free monies and resources to 
1
create conditions that are conducive to a culture of 
2
peace. 
3
(9) Violence prevention is cost effective. For 
4
every dollar spent on violence prevention and 
5
peacebuilding, thousands of lives and dollars are 
6
saved. Research indicates that investing early to pre-
7
vent conflicts from escalating into violent crises is, 
8
on average, 60 times more cost effective than inter-
9
vening after violence erupts. The philosophy and 
10
techniques of nonviolence and the science of 
11
peacebuilding provide tools and techniques that can 
12
be applied not only at the levels of individual and 
13
community growth, but also within the Federal Gov-
14
ernment and at national and international levels. 
15
(10) The United Nations recognizes that pro-
16
motion of peace is vital for the full enjoyment of all 
17
human rights and the United Nations Declaration 
18
on the Right of Peoples to Peace mandates that 
19
preservation of the right to peace is a fundamental 
20
obligation of each country. In 1999, the United Na-
21
tions adopted a Programme of Action on a Culture 
22
of Peace, stating that a culture of peace is an inte-
23
gral approach to preventing violence and violent con-
24
flicts, an alternative to the culture of war and vio-

lence, and is based on education for peace, the pro-
1
motion of sustainable economic and social develop-
2
ment, respect for human rights, equality between 
3
women and men, democratic participation, tolerance, 
4
the free flow of information, and disarmament. The 
5
United Nations declared the years 2001 through 
6
2010 an International Decade for a Culture of Peace 
7
and Non-Violence for the Children of the World, and 
8
the United Nations supports a culture of peace. In 
9
2015, the United Nations adopted 17 sustainable 
10
development goals, including promotion of peaceful 
11
and inclusive societies which recognize the link be-
12
tween justice, human rights, and government based 
13
on the rule of law and peace. 
14
(11) Peacebuilding is defined by the United Na-
15
tions as a range of measures targeted to reduce the 
16
risk of lapsing or relapsing into conflict by strength-
17
ening national capacities at all levels for conflict 
18
management and to lay the foundations for sustain-
19
able peace and development. Peacebuilding is built 
20
upon research into the root causes of violence in the 
21
United States and the world, through promotion and 
22
promulgation of effective policies and programs that 
23
ameliorate those root causes of violence, and through 
24
providing all citizens, organizations, and govern-

mental bodies with opportunities to learn about and

practice the essential tools of nonviolent conflict res-
2
olution and peacebuilding. 
3
(12) In 2000, the Earth Charter Commission 
4
released the Earth Charter, an international declara-
5
tion of fundamental values and principles created to 
6
build a just, sustainable, and peaceful global society. 
7
The preamble of the Earth Charter provides, ‘‘To 
8
move forward we must recognize that in the midst 
9
of a magnificent diversity of cultures and life forms 
10
we are one human family and one Earth community 
11
with a common destiny. We must join together to 
12
bring forth a sustainable global society founded on 
13
respect for nature, universal human rights, economic 
14
justice, and a culture of peace.’’. Peacebuilding is 
15
working together with all countries to protect both 
16
life and land and hold the Earth in balance. 
17
(13) Systemic racism is a significant driver of 
18
violence and key obstacle to peace in the United 
19
States. Confronting and uprooting systemic racism 
20
in America will require efforts by the Federal Gov-
21
ernment both to properly acknowledge, memorialize, 
22
and be a catalyst for progress toward permanently 
23
eliminating persistent racial inequities, including
