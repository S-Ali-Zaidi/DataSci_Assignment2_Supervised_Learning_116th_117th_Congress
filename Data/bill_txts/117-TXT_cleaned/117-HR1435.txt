‘‘maintain international peace and security, and to that 
end: to take effective collective measures for the preven-
tion and removal of threats to the peace, and for the sup-
pression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the 
peace, and to bring about by peaceful means, and in con-
formity with the principles of justice and international
