SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Mental Health Justice 
2
and Parity Act of 2022’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) Needless institutionalization (including in 
6
psychiatric hospitals) of people with disabilities is 
7
generally a violation of the Americans with Disabil-
8
ities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.), and the 
9
failure to provide sufficient community-based serv-
10
ices (such as supported housing, assertive commu-
11
nity treatment, mobile crisis, peer support, and sup-
12
ported employment) has resulted in needless institu-
13
tionalization as well as incarceration of persons with 
14
mental illness or an intellectual or developmental 
15
disability. 
16
(2) In the landmark 1999 Supreme Court case 
17
Olmstead v. L.C., the Supreme Court ruled that the 
18
‘‘unjustified institutional isolation of persons with 
19
disabilities is a form of discrimination’’ prohibited by 
20
the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 
21
U.S.C. 12101 et seq.). 
22
(3) Regulations promulgated by the Attorney 
23
General in 1991 affirm that title II of the Ameri-
24
cans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12131 
25
et seq.) requires public entities to ‘‘administer serv-
26

•HR 7254 IH
ices, programs, and activities in the most integrated 
1
setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individ-
2
uals with disabilities’’ (28 C.F.R. 35.130(d)). The 
3
regulation defines ‘‘the most integrated setting’’ as 
4
one that ‘‘enables individuals with disabilities to 
5
interact with nondisabled persons to the fullest ex-
6
tent possible’’ (28 C.F.R. pt. 35, App. B). 
7
(4) Yet today, persons with a mental illness or 
8
an intellectual or developmental disability are more 
9
likely to be incarcerated and to be subject to exces-
10
sive use of force by law enforcement officers. For ex-
11
ample— 
12
(A) one out of every four of the deaths 
13
caused by law enforcement officers is a person 
14
with mental illness; and 
15
(B) persons with a mental illness or an in-
16
tellectual or developmental disability are often 
17
charged with minor, nonviolent offenses, and 
18
for many of these persons, arrest and incarcer-
19
ation could have been avoided if they had access 
20
to intensive community-based services and sta-
21
ble housing. 
22
(5) Many of the police encounters that lead to 
23
the incarceration (and in too many cases, death) of 
24
people with mental illness or an intellectual or devel-
25
23:02 Mar 29, 2022
H7254
4 
•HR 7254 IH
opmental disability could be avoided by having in 
1
place systems that ensure that calls to 9–1–1 or to 
2
law enforcement result in dispatch of mental health 
3
professionals, peer support workers, or others rather 
4
than law enforcement officers. 
5
(6) Many people who are incarcerated would be 
6
better served in community services. If there were 
7
sufficient community services, and persons with 
8
mental illness or an intellectual or developmental 
9
disability were connected to those services rather 
10
than being arrested, thousands of people with men-
11
tal illness or an intellectual or developmental dis-
12
ability would avoid needless admissions to hospitals 
13
or jails. Further, jails and hospitals would experi-
14
ence less crowding.
