RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the designation of July 20, 2022, 
as ‘‘National Heroes Day’’ to honor the sacrifices of 
everyday heroes who save lives and improve their commu-
nities. 
Whereas, 10 years ago, on July 20, 2012, in Aurora, Colo-
rado, 12 lives were taken and many more were injured, 
yet we saw remarkable acts of bravery in the face of un-
speakable violence and everyday people risked their lives 
to save countless others; 
Whereas, first inspired by the two servicemembers and two 
civilians whose lives were taken while shielding others on 
July 20, 2012, in an Aurora theater, we recognize July 
20 as ‘‘National Heroes Day’’ to honor the sacrifices of
