SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
The Congress finds as follows: 
2
(1) In an April 2016 forum at the Council on 
3
Foreign Relations, then-Secretary of the Treasury 
4
Jacob Lew stated that, under the Joint Comprehen-
5
sive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the United States 
6
committed to lifting its nuclear sanctions, ‘‘but the 
7
U.S. financial system is not open to Iran, and that 
8
is not something that is going to change’’. 
9
(2) In September 2016, however, the Depart-
10
ment of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets 
11
Control (OFAC) issued licenses authorizing United 
12
States financial institutions ‘‘to engage in all trans-
13
actions necessary to provide financing or other fi-
14
nancial services’’ in order to effectuate the sale of 
15
aircraft to flagship state-owned carrier Iran Air. The 
16
Department had sanctioned Iran Air in 2011 for its 
17
use of commercial passenger aircraft to transport 
18
rockets, missiles, and other military cargo on behalf 
19
of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) 
20
and Iran’s Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces 
21
Logistics, both of which had been sanctioned under 
22
Executive Order No. 13382 for weapons prolifera-
23
tion-related activities. In October 2017, the IRGC 
24
went on to be designated under Executive Order No. 
25
13224 for its support of the IRGC–Qods Force,

which has provided support to terrorist groups such 
1
as Hizballah, Hamas, and the Taliban. Iran Air had 
2
also delivered missile or rocket components to the 
3
Assad government in Syria, which like Iran is classi-
4
fied as a state sponsor of terrorism. 
5
(3) Iran remains classified by the Department 
6
of the Treasury as a jurisdiction of primary money 
7
laundering concern. In 2019, the Financial Crimes 
8
Enforcement Network (FinCEN) issued a final rule 
9
‘‘to prohibit the opening or maintaining of cor-
10
respondent accounts in the United States for, or on 
11
behalf of, Iranian financial institutions, and the use 
12
of foreign financial institutions’ correspondent ac-
13
counts at covered U.S. financial institutions to proc-
14
ess transactions involving Iranian financial institu-
15
tions’’. This measure, according to FinCEN, was re-
16
lated to important United States policy goals, 
17
‘‘namely to deny the Iranian regime resources to 
18
support terrorism, develop nuclear weapons and/or 
19
the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, ad-
20
vance its ballistic missile program, oppress the Ira-
21
nian people, and fuel conflicts in Syria, Afghanistan, 
22
Yemen and elsewhere’’. At the time this measure 
23
was imposed, FinCEN stated that it ‘‘will further 
24
protect the U.S. financial system from Iran by en-
25

suring that U.S. financial institutions are not ex-
1
posed to Iran’s ongoing illicit finance activities, in-
2
cluding its support for international terrorism’’. 
3
(4) In February 2020, the Financial Action 
4
Task Force (FATF) determined that Iran had not 
5
completed its action plan to address strategic defi-
6
ciencies in countering money laundering, terrorist fi-
7
nancing, and weapons proliferation. The FATF 
8
therefore returned Iran to its ‘‘black list’’ and re-
9
newed its call for countries to apply countermeasures 
10
against Iran in order to protect the international fi-
11
nancial system. 
12
SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON AUTHORIZATIONS FOR UNITED 
13
STATES FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. 
14
The Secretary of the Treasury may not authorize a 
15
transaction by a U.S. financial institution (as defined 
16
under section 561.309 of title 31, Code of Federal Regula-
17
tions) in connection with the importation from or expor-
18
tation to the Islamic Republic of Iran of any goods, serv-
19
ices, or technology, other than the sale of agricultural 
20
commodities, food, medicine, or medical devices benefit-
21
ting the civilian population of Iran.

(12 U.S.C. 635(b)) is amended by adding at the end the
