RESOLUTION 
Recognizing that it is the duty of the Federal Government 
to develop and implement a Transgender Bill of Rights 
to protect and codify the rights of transgender and non-
binary people under the law and ensure their access 
to medical care, shelter, safety, and economic security. 
Whereas an estimated 1,400,000 transgender adults live in 
the United States; 
Whereas title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 requires 
equal treatment under the law regardless of sex; 
Whereas the Supreme Court affirmed in Bostock v. Clayton 
County that Federal protection against discrimination on 
the basis of sex includes protection from discrimination 
on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity; 
Whereas despite these protections, transgender people still ex-
perience discrimination in medical care, employment, 
housing, education, lending, and other basic necessities; 
Whereas the right of transgender and nonbinary people to 
seek lifesaving, gender-affirming care and counseling is 
under threat across the Nation; 
Whereas transgender and nonbinary people face significant 
barriers to legal recognition of their truest selves on gov-
ernment documentation and identification; 
Whereas transgender and nonbinary people experience dis-
proportionately high rates of poverty, homelessness, vio-
lence, and suicide; and 
Whereas transgender and nonbinary people detained in jails, 
prisons, and immigration detention centers are especially 
vulnerable to violence and abuse and are often deprived
