•HR 4838 IH
(1) There are currently 1.8 billion young people 
1
in the world, the largest number ever to have ex-
2
isted. One in 4 youth are directly involved in and af-
3
fected by conflict. 
4
(2) Youth represent the majority of the popu-
5
lation in many conflict-affected countries, where on 
6
average 50 percent of the population is below the 
7
age of 20, and in some countries more than 70 per-
8
cent of the population is below the age of 30. 
9
(3) Around the world, youth remain under-rep-
10
resented in peace building and conflict prevention, 
11
management, and resolution, and post-conflict relief 
12
and recovery efforts. 
13
(4) Violence impacts over 1 billion people glob-
14
ally each year. 
15
(5) Youth and youth-led groups and movements 
16
led by them have demonstrated the capacity to play 
17
critical roles in— 
18
(A) de-escalating destructive conflict from 
19
spreading; 
20
(B) preventing recurring cycles of violence; 
21
(C) effectively encouraging defection from 
22
armed groups; 
23
(D) improving the effectiveness and sus-
24
tainability of peace processes and agreements;

(E) improving social cohesion and toler-
1
ance between and among groups; 
2
(F) building resilience to violence and re-
3
cruitment; 
4
(G) strengthening a culture of peace and 
5
security; and 
6
(H) contributing to improved and more in-
7
clusive democracy and governance. 
8
(6) Youth are critical actors in development at 
9
all levels of society, despite personal risks, oper-
10
ational challenges, and limited technical and finan-
11
cial support for their work. 
12
(7) Preventive and resilience-based approaches 
13
to youth are more effective at reducing violence than 
14
hard security responses and at-risk and remedial ap-
15
proaches, which are often counterproductive. 
16
(8) Youth who have participated in United 
17
States-supported civic engagement and development 
18
programs were less likely to participate in or support 
19
political violence. 
20
(9) Youth participation in the design and imple-
21
mentation of community development strategies is 
22
critical for effectively reducing violence and extre-
23
mism, and increasing peace.

(10) Young people, particularly girls, around 
1
the world face the added pressure of online harass-
2
ment, which limits their ability to participate in on-
3
line peacebuilding movements. In a study by PLAN 
4
International, 58 percent of girls reported that they 
5
have personally experienced some form of online har-
6
assment on social media platforms, and activists in 
7
particular attract additional harassment. In the 
8
same study, 47 percent of respondents reported 
9
being attacked for their opinions. 
10
(11) The shrinking of global civic spaces facing 
11
youth, as documented in the United Nations Office 
12
of the Secretary General’s Envoy on Youth’s report, 
13
‘‘If I Disappear’’, shows the complexity of the grave 
14
threats, challenges, and barriers against diverse 
15
groups of youth active in the civic space, taking the 
16
forms of sociocultural, financial, political, legal, dig-
17
ital, and physical. 
18
(12) Many national and international mecha-
19
nisms for the protection of human rights defenders, 
20
peacebuilders, and humanitarians usually apply to 
21
adults and adolescents, excluding youth, due to their 
22
age.

(14) United Nations Security Council Resolu-
5
tion 2419 on Youth, Peace, and Security, which was 
6
adopted on June 6, 2018, calls for increasing and 
7
formalizing the role of youth in negotiating and im-
8
plementing peace agreements.

(15) United Nations Security Council Resolu-
10
tion 2535 on Youth, Peace, and Security, which was 
11
adopted on July 14, 2020, advocates for the in-
12
creased protection of youth peacebuilders at risk of 
13
violence, creates a two-year reporting mechanism on 
14
Youth, Peace, and Security, and recognizes the crit-
15

16
such as COVID–19.
