Whereas public safety telecommunications professionals play 
a critical role in emergency response; 
Whereas the work that public safety telecommunications pro-

safety telecommunications professional, whose negotiation 
skills can prevent the situation from worsening; 
Whereas, during crises, public safety telecommunications pro-
fessionals, while collecting vital information to provide 
situational awareness for responding officers— 
(1) coach callers through first aid techniques; and 
(2) give advice to those callers to prevent further 
harm; 
Whereas the work done by individuals who serve as public 
safety telecommunications professionals has an extreme 
emotional and physical toll on those individuals, which is 
compounded by long hours and the around-the-clock na-
ture of the job; 
Whereas public safety telecommunications professionals 
should be recognized by all levels of government for the 
lifesaving and protective nature of their work; 
Whereas major emergencies, including natural disasters and 
the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID–19) pandemic, 
highlight the dedication of public safety telecommuni-
cations professionals and their important work in pro-
tecting the public and police, fire, and emergency medical 
officials; and 
Whereas public safety telecommunications professionals are 
often called as witnesses to provide important testimony 
in criminal trials: Now, therefore, be it
