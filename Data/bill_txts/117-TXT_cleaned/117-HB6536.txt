•HR 6536 IH
(1) Slavery and involuntary servitude are in-
1
compatible with American society and law. 
2
(2) The 13th Amendment to the United States 
3
Constitution abolished legal slavery and involuntary 
4
servitude in the United States. 
5
(3) Despite slavery being abolished in 1865, 
6
modern forms of slavery still exist throughout the 
7
United States. 
8
(4) Every year, hundreds of thousands of Amer-
9
icans and immigrants are coerced into commercial 
10
sex acts against their will. 
11
(5) In addition to sexual exploitation, victims of 
12
trafficking suffer repeated physical, mental, and 
13
emotional abuse at the hands of their traffickers. 
14
(6) Abortion providers and facilities aid sex 
15
traffickers by turning a blind eye to the plight of 
16
abused women. 
17
(7) The Department of State’s 2017 Traf-
18
ficking in Persons Report indicated that sex traf-
19
fickers coerce women into receiving abortions against 
20
their will. 
21
(8) Research conducted by Laura J. Lederer

and Christopher A. Wetzel, entitled ‘‘The Health

ties’’ published in the Annals of Health Law Jour-
1
nal, indicated that 71 percent of women coerced into 
2
commercial sex acts reported at least one pregnancy 
3
and 21 percent reported five or more pregnancies 
4
while trafficked (23 Annals Health L. 61 (2014)). 
5
(9) Lederer and Wetzel’s research found that 
6
almost a third of women trafficked reported under-
7
went numerous abortions as victims of trafficking. 
8
More than half of respondents answered that their 
9
abortion while a victim of sex trafficking was a re-
10
sult of coercion. One victim of sex trafficking re-
11
counted, ‘‘[in most of my six abortions,] I was under 
12
serious pressure from my pimps to abort the ba-
13
bies’’. 
14
(10) A moral obligation exists to report sus-
15
pected instances of sex trafficking to authorities. 
16
(11) Section 2 of the 13th Amendment empow-
17
ers Congress to enact appropriate legislation to com-
18
bat all forms of slavery and involuntary servitude, 
19
including forced sex trafficking.
