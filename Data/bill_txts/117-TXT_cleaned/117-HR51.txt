the United States Capitol in a violent attempt to over-
turn the 2020 electoral college results; 
Whereas, on that day, President Trump addressed the insur-
rectionists and continued his previous attacks on the 
media, calling journalists ‘‘the biggest problem we have’’; 
Whereas President Trump then falsely claimed that the 2020 
Presidential election was ‘‘stolen by the fake news 
media’’; 
Whereas President Trump then labeled the media ‘‘the enemy 
of the people’’ and again referred to it as ‘‘the biggest 
problem we have in this country’’; 
Whereas the insurrectionists then surrounded, threatened, 
and struck journalists, destroying equipment and forcing 
personnel to flee for fear of their safety; 
Whereas insurrectionists continued to target journalists 
throughout their invasion of the Capitol, vandalizing one 
door with their intent to ‘‘Murder the media’’; and 
Whereas despite the overwhelming threats to their lives, jour-
nalists bravely continued to report on the bloody January 
6th insurrection while also protecting and caring for vic-
tims caught in the attack: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
