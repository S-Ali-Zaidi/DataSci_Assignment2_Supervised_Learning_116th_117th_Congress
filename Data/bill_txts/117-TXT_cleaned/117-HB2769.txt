SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress makes the following findings: 
2
(1) An effective transportation system for the 
3
Nation requires dedicated, predictable Federal fund-
4
ing for various capital and operating expenses, as 
5
demonstrated by the Highway Trust Fund, which 
6
supports all Federal highway programs, most public 
7
transit programs, and many Federal transportation 
8
safety programs. 
9
(2) Intercity passenger rail is the only surface 
10
transportation mode in the United States that— 
11
(A) does not receive any Federal funding 
12
through a trust fund for capital investment; 
13
and 
14
(B) is completely dependent on annual dis-
15
cretionary appropriations for both its capital ex-
16
penses and its operating costs. 
17
(3) In fiscal year 2019, Amtrak experienced 
18
record ridership, a historic low operating loss, and a 
19
record capital spend rate. 
20
(4) In markets with sufficient infrastructure 
21
and train frequency, Amtrak has proven to be an ef-
22
fective mode of transportation compared to commer-
23
cial air and bus service and private automobile use. 
24
(5) Intercity passenger rail offers substantial 
25
safety, energy, and environmental advantages com-

•HR 2769 IH
pared to most other transportation modes, but dec-
1
ades of in sufficient capital funding has drastically 
2
limited the role that intercity passenger rail can play 
3
in the Nation’s overall transportation network. 
4
(6) There are critical capital needs for the 
5
Northeast Corridor and the National Network, in-
6
cluding infrastructure, fleet, stations, and facilities. 
7
(7) Adding to the urgency of these capital in-
8
vestment needs, due to changing demographics, pop-
9
ulation growth, urbanization, and changing travel 
10
trends, intercity passenger rail will be needed to help 
11
move our Nation into the future. 
12
(8) For these reasons, an Intercity Passenger 
13
Rail Trust Fund is needed now, more than ever, to 
14
ensure a safe, sustainable, convenient transportation 
15
option for the people of the United States.
