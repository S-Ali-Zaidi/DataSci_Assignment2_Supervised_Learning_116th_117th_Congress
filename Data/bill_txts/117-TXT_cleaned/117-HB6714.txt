A BILL 
To direct the Secretary of the Navy to close the Red Hill 
Bulk Fuel Storage Facility in Hawaii, and for other 
purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Red Hill Watershed 
4
and Aquifer Initiative Act’’ or the ‘‘Red Hill WAI Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress makes the following findings: 
7
(1) The Red Hill Underground Fuel Storage 
8
Facility (in this section referred to as the ‘‘Red Hill 
9
facility’’ ) was constructed in September 1943.

•HR 6714 IH
(2) The Red Hill facility was constructed un-
1
derground in hollowed-out volcanic rock to allow for 
2
maximum protection of the fuel supply. 
3
(3) The Red Hill facility’s 20 steel tanks are 
4
encased by 2.5 to 4 feet of concrete and surrounded 
5
by basalt bedrock. 
6
(4) The Red Hill facility is the largest single 
7
Department of Defense fuel storage facility in the 
8
Pacific theater. 
9
(5) The Red Hill facility can store approxi-
10
mately 250,000,000 gallons of fuel. The fuels stored 
11
are marine diesel, F–76, and two types of jet fuel: 
12
JP–5 and JP–8. 
13
(6) The Red Hill facility is located approxi-
14
mately 100 feet above the basal groundwater table 
15
and sits directly above the island of Oahu’s federally 
16
designated sole-source groundwater aquifer, the 
17
Southern Oahu Basal Aquifer, which provides ap-
18
proximately 77 percent of Oahu’s drinking water. 
19
(7) Historic records compiled by the Navy in a 
20
2008 groundwater protection plan indicate that the 
21
Red Hill facility has had dozens of fuel leaks dating 
22
back to 1947.

(8) The Red Hill facility’s fuel leaks pose an ex-
1
istential threat to Oahu’s federally designated sole- 
2
source groundwater aquifer. 
3
(9) The Navy and the Defense Logistics Agency 
4
are responsible for protecting the public from un-
5
scheduled fuel leaks that may pose a risk to the 
6
drinking water. 
7
(10) Until the mid-1980s most underground 
8
storage tanks (in this section referred to as 
9
‘‘USTs’’) were made of bare steel, which is likely to 
10
corrode over time and allow UST contents to leak 
11
into the environment. The greatest potential hazard 
12
from a leaking UST is that its contents (petroleum 
13
or other hazardous substances) can seep into the soil 
14
and contaminate groundwater, the source of drink-
15
ing water for nearly half of all Americans. 
16
(11) To address a nationwide problem of leak-
17
ing USTs, Congress passed a series of laws to pro-
18
tect human health and the environment, including 
19
the Solid Waste Disposal Act, the Superfund 
20
Amendments Reauthorization Act, the Energy Policy 
21
Act of 2005, and the American Recovery And Rein-
22
vestment Act of 2009 (commonly referred to as the 
23
‘‘Recovery Act’’).

(12) The State of Hawaii obtained Environ-
1
mental Protection Agency State Program approval, 
2
effective on September 2, 2002, for Hawaii’s UST 
3
program to operate in lieu of the Environmental 
4
Protection Agency UST program. 
5
(13) In January 2014, The Red Hill facility 
6
leaked approximately 27,000 gallons of fuel. 
7
(14) In 2015, the Environmental Protection 
8
Agency and the State of Hawaii Department of 
9
Health negotiated an enforceable agreement, an Ad-
10
ministrative Order on Consent, with the Navy and 
11
the Defense Logistics Agency (EPA DKT NO. 
12
RCRA 7003–R9–2015–01/DOH DKT NO. 15– 
13
UST–EA–01). 
14
(15) The 2015 Administrative Order on Con-
15
sent includes a Statement of Work that lays out the 
16
specific tasks the Navy and the Defense Logistics 
17
Agency must implement. The Statement of Work 
18
consists of 8 sections on overall project management, 
19
as follows: 
20
(A) Tank inspection. 
21
(B) Repair and maintenance. 
22
(C) Tank upgrade alternatives. 
23
(D) Release detection and tank tightness 
24
testing.

(F) Investigation and remediation of re-
2
leases.

(G) Groundwater protection and evalua-
4
tion. 
5
(H) Risk and vulnerability assessment.

(16) On May 6, 2021, a burst pipeline in Red 
7
Hill spilled fuel into the facility’s lower access tunnel 
8
and the Navy failed to recover the entirety of the 
9
leaked fuel. While the Navy initially estimated that 
10
1,618 gallons of fuel spilled, with all but 38 gallons 
11
recovered, several months later, the Navy’s esti-
12
mated amount of fuel spilled increased to 19,000 
13
gallons, with most of the spilled fuel not recovered. 
14
(17) On November 20, 2021, the Navy an-
15
nounced a spill of 14,000 gallons of a water and fuel 
16
mixture from a fire suppression drain line located 
17
0.25 miles downhill of the fuel tanks at Red Hill due 
18
to operator error. 
19
(18) On November 22, 2021, the Navy an-
20
nounced that the water and fuel mixture was re-
21
moved from the tunnel and put into a storage tank 
22
above ground and that there were no signs that the 
23
fuel had escaped into the environment. The Navy 
24
communicated that the water was safe to drink.

(19) On November 28, 2021, military families 
1
and civilians living in the Joint Base Pearl Harbor- 
2
Hickam military housing installation began report-
3
ing contaminated tap water. 
4
(20) Impacted families shared personal experi-
5
ences of the immediate and ongoing health impacts 
6
of exposure to the contaminated water in their 
7
homes including chemical burns, stomach and head 
8
pain, dizziness and nauseousness, rashes and more. 
9
(21) Families reported noxious odors in im-
10
pacted homes that continued to make this housing 
11
unsuitable for many families. 
12
(22) After it was definitively confirmed that the 
13
Red Hill well was contaminated with petroleum, the 
14
State of Hawaii Department of Health issued an 
15
emergency order on December 6, 2021, to the 
16
United States Navy to suspend operations and 
17
defuel the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility. That 
18
emergency order was contested by the Navy in late 
19
December, and on January 3, 2022, it was re-
20
affirmed by the State of Hawaii, Department of 
21
Health in its final decision and order. 
22
(23) The December 6, 2021, emergency order 
23
has had broad support from the communities of 
24
Oahu, the Governor, the Department of Health,

the City and County Board of Water Supply, city 
2
council members, and State legislators. In short, the 
3
whole-of-government in Hawaii believes that the 
4
Navy should comply with the emergency order. 
5
(24) On December 7, 2021 the Navy announced 
6
that they will contest the State of Hawaii’s order to 
7
drain the fuel tanks. 
8
(25) On December 10, 2021, the Navy con-
9
firmed samples taken from the Navy Red Hill Shaft 
10
contained fuel levels 350 times more than the State 
11
of Hawaii’s safe drinking limit. 
12
(26) On February 2, 2022, the Department of 
13
Justice filed an appeal in both Federal and State 
14
court over the State of Hawaii’s order to defuel Red 
15
Hill.
