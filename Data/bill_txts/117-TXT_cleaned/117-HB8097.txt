istrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Adminis-
tration to establish an initiative to conduct research, 
development, and demonstration on technologies capable

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress makes the following findings: 
2
(1) Air travel currently contributes approxi-
3
mately 3 percent to global carbon emissions, but 
4
emissions from this sector are expected to triple by 
5
2050. 
6
(2) A healthy, thriving aviation sector contrib-
7
utes to the quality of life and economic well-being of 
8
the United States. In 2016, the Federal Aviation 
9
Administration found that civil aviation accounted 
10
for 5.2 percent of the United States gross domestic 
11
product, generated $1.8 trillion, and supported 
12
10,900,000 jobs. 
13
(3) Existing aircraft technologies contribute to 
14
noise pollution that has adverse impacts on the qual-
15
ity of life in affected communities. As air traffic vol-
16
umes increase and the adoption of performance- 
17
based navigation technology proceeds, the problem of 
18
noise pollution is becoming more severe in some 
19
areas. 
20
(4) The United States has adopted a goal of 
21
net-zero greenhouse gas emissions from the United 
22
States aviation sector by 2050. 
23
(5) Research on technologies to lessen the envi-
24
ronmental and noise impacts of aviation is ongoing, 
25
but should accelerate, and should include work on 
26
