RESOLUTION 
Honoring the individuals fighting and the individuals who 
have fallen responding to wildland fires during the ongo-
ing 2021 wildfire season. 
Whereas more than 5,000,000 acres have burned in wildfire 
in 2021; 
Whereas changing climates, resulting in long-term trends of 
warmer and drier weather, and mismanagement of the 
forests of the United States are exacerbating the threat 
of wildfires and contributing to the greater than normal 
fire activity in Western States, resulting in dangerous 
conditions for wildland firefighters; 
Whereas more than 16,000 personnel have been assigned to 
contain and combat the fires that threaten the West;

demic has exacerbated the public health and public safety 
risks inherent in combating wildfires;

firefighters were established more than 30 years ago and 
should be re-evaluated based on the current wildfire risk 
and job market; and

community leaders have acted bravely and risked their 
lives to contain dangerous wildfires across the United 
States to protect families and critical infrastructure:
