RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the People’s Republic of China should be held account-
able for its handling of COVID–19. 
Whereas the first reported case of Coronavirus Disease 2019 
(commonly referred to as ‘‘COVID–19’’) was reported as 
early as November 17, 2019; 
Whereas the first human-to-human transmission of the dis-
ease was recorded by doctors in Wuhan, China on De-
cember 8, 2019; 
Whereas the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission did not 
inform the World Health Organization (WHO) of the

Whereas Chinese social media censors curbed alerts of the 
outbreak to the public, including by blocking a com-
prehensive list of coronavirus-related terms from online 
discussion; 
Whereas Dr. Li Wenliang, a physician at Wuhan Central hos-
pital who warned his colleagues of the possible outbreak 
of COVID–19 in December 2019, was summoned and ad-
monished by Wuhan police for ‘‘making false comments 
on the Internet’’, and later died of the virus; 
Whereas, on January 3, 2020, China’s National Health Com-
mission (NHC) ordered institutions ‘‘not to publish any 
information related to the unknown disease’’ and ordered 
labs to ‘‘transfer any samples they had to designated 
testing institutions or to destroy them’’; 
Whereas the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, Dr. Robert Redfield, was not notified by his 
Chinese colleagues of COVID–19 until January 3, 2020, 
47 days after the first reported case of the virus; 
Whereas nearly six weeks after doctors in Wuhan raised the 
possibility of human-to-human transmission of the virus, 
Chinese officials continued to deny any recorded cases of 
such transmissions; 
Whereas Chinese authorities did not begin taking steps to-
ward locking down the city of Wuhan until January 23, 
2020, over two months after the first reported case of 
COVID–19; 
Whereas critics of China’s slow response to the outbreak, in-
cluding Chinese businessman Ren Zhiqiang, were re-
ported to have disappeared; and 
Whereas the Chinese Communist Party actively engaged in a 
cover-up designed to obfuscate data and hide relevant

public health information, and these actions continue to 
limit efforts to identify the original source of COVID–19: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-
1
resentatives that— 
2
(1) the global outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 
3
2019 (commonly referred to as ‘‘COVID–19’’) is a 
4
direct result of the People’s Republic of China’s long 
5
and appalling record of human rights abuses, includ-
6
ing its suppression of the freedom of expression, as 
7
well as its aggressive domestic and global propa-
8
ganda campaign; 
9
(2) the People’s Republic of China should be 
10
held accountable for its handling of the COVID–19; 
11
and 
12
(3) the United States and other countries 
13
should permanently withhold payments on debts 
14
owed to the People’s Republic of China in amounts 
15
equal to the public costs incurred by such countries 
16
relating to COVID–19.
