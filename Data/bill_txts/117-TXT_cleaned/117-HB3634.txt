SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Taiwan Diplomatic Re-
2
view Act’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) Pursuant to the Taiwan Relations Act (22 
6
U.S.C. 3301(b)(1)), it is the policy of the United 
7
States to ‘‘promote extensive, close, and friendly 
8
commercial, cultural, and other relations between 
9
the people of the United States and the people of 
10
Taiwan’’. 
11
(2) In May 2019, the Taiwanese counterpart to 
12
the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), the Coordi-
13
nation Council for North American Affairs was re-
14
named Taiwan Council for U.S. Affairs. 
15
(3) It is the policy of the United States to refer 
16
to Taiwan as ‘‘Taiwan’’, not ‘‘Taipei’’ or ‘‘Chinese 
17
Taipei’’. 
18
(4) The Taipei Economic and Cultural Rep-
19
resentative Office (TECRO) is inaptly named as it 
20
works to cultivate the extensive, close, and friendly 
21
commercial, cultural, and other relations between 
22
the people of the United States and the people, orga-
23
nizations, and enterprises of Taiwan, not merely 
24
those in Taipei.

•HR 3634 IH
(5) The Director of the AIT serves as the prin-
1
cipal representative of the United States in Taiwan 
2
and is responsible for preserving and promoting ex-
3
tensive, close, and friendly commercial, cultural, and 
4
other relations between the people of the United 
5
States and the people on Taiwan on behalf of the 
6
United States Government. 
7
(6) As Taiwan is a critical partner of the 
8
United States in the Indo-Pacific, robust oversight 
9
over United States policy towards the island is nec-
10
essary. 
11
(7) Requiring the advice and consent of the 
12
Senate with regards to the Director of the AIT sig-
13
nals the importance of the U.S.-Taiwan relationship. 
14
(8) Several officers with relatively limited policy 
15
roles when compared to the Director of the Amer-
16
ican Institute in Taiwan are subject to the advice 
17
and consent of the Senate including the officials at 
18
the John F. Kennedy Center For The Performing 
19
Arts and the Barry Goldwater Scholarship And Ex-
20
cellence In Education Foundation. 
21
(9) Officers at non-profit corporations may be 
22
subject to the advice and consent of the Senate, in-
23
cluding the United States Institutes of Peace, which 
24
is ‘‘an independent nonprofit corporation and an or-

ganization described in section 170(c)(2)(B) of the 
1
Internal Revenue Code of 1986’’. 
2
(10) Congress has the power to create positions 
3
that are ‘‘officers of the United States’’ pursuant to 
4
the Appointments Clause that are not employees of 
5
the United States Government. 
6
(11) As the United States does not have diplo-
7
matic relations with Taiwan, Taiwanese officials and 
8
diplomats do not receive diplomatic visas; instead, 
9
they are provided investor visas, which do not accu-
10
rately represent their purpose in the United States 
11
as official representatives of Taiwan.
