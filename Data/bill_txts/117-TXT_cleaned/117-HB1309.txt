(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
8
(1) Eating disorders affect approximately 
9
30,000,000 Americans (or nine percent of the popu-
10
lation) during their lifetime, including individuals 
11
from every age, gender, body size, race, ethnicity, 
12
and socioeconomic status. 
13
(2) Eating disorders are severe, biologically 
14
based, mental illnesses caused by a complex inter-
15
action of genetic, biological, social, behavioral, and 
16
psychological factors. 
17
(3) Eating disorders result in the second high-
18
est case fatality rate of any mental illness, with one 
19
death occurring every 52 minutes as a direct result 
20
of an eating disorder due to serious medical co- 
21
morbidities and suicide. 
22
(4) Untreated eating disorders cost the econ-
23
omy of the United States $64.70 billion annually, 
24
with families and individuals experiencing an eco-
25
nomic loss of $23.50 billion annually.

(5) A study from the Armed Forces Health 
1
Surveillance Branch found that diagnoses of eating 
2
disorders among military personnel increased by 26 
3
percent from 2013 to 2016. Although accurate esti-
4
mates are challenging due to underreporting, the 
5
prevalence of eating disorders in the military is two 
6
to three times higher than in the civilian population. 
7
(6) The Defense Health Board found that fe-
8
male members of the Armed Forces on active duty 
9
experience high rates of eating disorders, which can 
10
adversely affect their readiness and health. 
11
(7) Risk factors for eating disorders in the mili-
12
tary include pressure to maintain weight and fitness 
13
standards, trauma, sexual harassment, weight stig-
14
matization, and post-traumatic stress disorder. 
15
(8) Family members of members of the Armed 
16
Forces have a higher prevalence of eating disorders 
17
than the general population, with 21 percent of chil-
18
dren and 26 percent of spouses of members of the 
19
Armed Forces found at risk of developing an eating 
20
disorder. 
21
(9) Research demonstrates a strong correlation 
22
between a military spouse and their adolescent 
23
child’s risk for an eating disorder. Adolescent female 
24
military dependents are more likely to be at risk for 
25
