RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the 2021 United Nations Climate 
Change Conference in Glasgow and reaffirming the 
United States commitment to international cooperation 
combating climate change. 
Whereas global climate change is an immediate threat to the 
United States national security, public health, national 
economy, and the legacy we will leave to our children; 
Whereas leaders of the world’s religious communities recog-
nize the grave threat to humanity posed by climate 
change and our moral obligation to protect the Earth and 
its people publicly have called upon politicians, business 
leaders, and the faithful to take action to address climate 
change; 
Whereas the most vulnerable communities, including commu-
nities of color, women, children, the elderly, persons with 
disabilities, low-income communities, and those with un-
derlying health conditions, face even greater health risks 
as a result of climate change; 
Whereas the United States is already seeing climate change 
exacerbate extreme weather events, with 2020 seeing the 
most active Atlantic hurricane season on record with 30

named storms and six major hurricanes, the 2019 
issuance of the first-ever Extreme Red Flag Warning for 
wildfires, hundreds of thousands of acres in the Western 
United States currently or recently experiencing dev-
astating wildfires, and communities around the country 
regularly facing ‘‘100-Year Floods’’; 
Whereas there is expert-level consensus within the Federal 
Government, from the intelligence community and De-
partment of Defense to the Department of Agriculture, 
Department of Transportation, and the National Oceanic 
and Atmospheric Administration, that climate change is 
real, currently impacting the United States, and poses a 
dire threat to our well-being and national security if left 
unaddressed; 
Whereas, on November 23, 2018, the United States Global 
Change Research Program, a collaboration of thirteen 
Federal agencies, released volume II of its fourth Na-
tional Climate Assessment outlining the impact climate 
change will have on human and societal welfare, in-
creased major severe weather events, adverse impacts on 
national infrastructure, and significant consequences for 
human health, in the face of Federal inaction toward 
combating climate change; 
Whereas, on August 6, 2021, the United Nations Intergov-
ernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released its 
Working Group I report which found that, unless imme-
diate and broad reductions in greenhouse gas emissions 
are made by the international community, it will be im-
possible to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius, the 
warming level which the scientific community believes will 
precipitate catastrophic climate-related consequences;

•HRES 755 IH 
Whereas the IPCC Working Group I report found that con-
tinued global warming will cause increasingly intense 
rainfall, flooding, and droughts, sea levels rising and 
more severe coastal flooding, and further melting of gla-
ciers and ice sheets; 
Whereas, on September 29, 2021, the United States Fish and 
Wildlife Service proposed the removal of 23 species from 
the Federal Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife 
due to extinction, listing climate change as a central vari-
able driving the increased extinction of a variety of spe-
cies; 
Whereas, on May 6, 2019, the United Nations Intergovern-
mental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Eco-
system Services (IPBES) released its updated Global As-
sessment, which found that approximately one million 
species, 1 in 4, are at risk of extinction as a direct result 
of climate change; 
Whereas the United Nations Secretary-General Anto´nio 
Guterres stated that the IPCC Working Group I report 
is a ‘‘code red for humanity . . . [G]reenhouse-gas emis-
sions from fossil-fuel burning and deforestation are chok-
ing our planet and putting billions of people at immediate 
risk,’’ and that ‘‘[g]reenhouse gas concentrations are at 
record levels. Extreme weather and climate disasters are 
increasing in frequency and intensity. That is why this 
year’s United Nations climate conference in Glasgow is 
so important’’; 
Whereas the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) 
Emissions Gap Report 2020, released in December 2020, 
highlighted that, while the COVID–19 has caused a 
slight reduction in carbon emissions, reduction targets 
will not be met ‘‘unless countries pursue an economic re-

covery that incorporates strong decarbonization,’’ and 
that ‘‘[i]t is not too late to seize future opportunities’’ in 
order for emissions reduction targets under the Paris 
Agreement to be met; 
Whereas the UNEP Emissions Gap Report 2020 also high-
lights the important role of nature-based solutions such 
as large-scale landscape restoration and reforestation, 
both in the United States and around the world, in order 
to meet the climate goals of the Paris Agreement; 
Whereas the United Nations Program on Reducing Emissions 
from Deforestation 2020 Annual Report highlights the 
critical role of continued and sustained reduction in de-
forestation and forest degradation around the world, the 
difficulties the COVID–19 pandemic has presented in 
slowing deforestation, and the central role that this effort 
has in combating climate change; 
Whereas, in September 2021, the Department of Defense re-
leased its Climate Adaptation Plan highlighting climate 
change’s significant threat to American national security 
and identifying ways climate change impacts the United 
States 
defense 
posture, 
including 
climate-related 
vulnerabilities of American defense installations, the role 
of climate change as a threat multiplier driving regional 
conflict, the potential for disruptions in the defense sup-
ply chain, and substantial ongoing operational challenges 
due to climate change; 
Whereas, in September 2021, the Department of Homeland 
Security released its Climate Action Plan addressing cli-
mate change’s impact on domestic security, identifying 
the potential for weather events to disrupt emergency 
communications infrastructure, the expected increasing of 
severe domestic weather events driving loss of life and

property while straining Federal resources, and the po-
tential for climate-related phenomena to drive regional 
migration; 
Whereas investing in energy efficiency and clean energy tech-
nologies is an extraordinary job creation opportunity for 
the United States that already employs more than 3 mil-
lion people, with solar and wind technicians being among 
the fastest growing jobs in the entire United States econ-
omy; 
Whereas the United States can lead the world in innovation 
and manufacturing clean energy technologies, creating 
good-paying jobs, modernizing the energy grid, and grow-
ing new companies that will be the titans of a new, clean 
energy economy; 
Whereas domestic clean energy jobs continue to be among the 
fastest growing occupations despite a temporary setback 
from the COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas President Joseph R. Biden announced his intent to 
rejoin the Paris Agreement on January 20, 2021, re-
affirming the United States commitment to fight against 
climate change and to collectively work with the inter-
national community toward that goal; 
Whereas the Paris Agreement is an international accord that 
aims to limit the increase in global temperatures to less 
than two degrees Celsius and urges efforts to limit the 
increase to one and a half degrees Celsius above 
preindustrial levels; 
Whereas the Paris Agreement highlights the importance of 
environmental justice and equity in our climate solutions, 
particularly in light of the impact climate change is ex-

pected to have on vulnerable communities around the 
globe; 
Whereas 195 parties are signatories and 191 are officially 
party to the Paris Agreement, including the largest 
emitters of carbon pollution, China, the European Union, 
and India; 
Whereas the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Con-
ference (COP26) is scheduled to be held in Glasgow, 
Scotland, between October 31 and November 12, 2021; 
Whereas the goals of COP26 are to— 
(1) secure global net-zero by 2050 and work to-
gether to ensure the 1.5 degrees Celsius global warming 
threshold is not exceeded; 
(2) facilitate all countries to protect and restore eco-
systems already impacted by climate change, and to en-
hance our resiliency and adaptation towards the future 
expected impacts of climate change; 
(3) work to ensure international financial contribu-
tions toward climate are mobilized; and 
(4) work to finalize the Paris rulebook to make the 
Paris Agreement operational and work to accelerate glob-
al action on climate through mobilization of government, 
businesses, and civil society; and 
Whereas the United States, historically as one of the world’s 
top emitters of carbon pollution, has an obligation to ac-
tively participate in global efforts to curb climate change: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
