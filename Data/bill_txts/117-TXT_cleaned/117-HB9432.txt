onstration, and commercial application program to be 
1
known as the ‘‘Airborne Wind Energy Research and De-
2
velopment Program’’ (in this section referred to as the 
3
‘‘Program’’) to improve understanding of the following: 
4
(1) The quantity, quality, and complementary 
5
nature of wind resources at elevations above 200 me-
6
ters. 
7
(2) Various airborne wind energy concepts 
8
through modeling and simulation, including power 
9
density, robust controls, and scaling potential. 
10
(3) Potential benefits of airborne wind energy, 
11
such as portability, low material inputs, viewshed, 
12
and existing grid interconnections. 
13
(4) Environmental impacts of airborne wind en-
14
ergy technology. 
15
(5) Noise and visual impacts, as well as any 
16
other human impacts of airborne wind energy tech-
17
nology. 
18
(b) ACTIVITIES.—In carrying out the Program, the 
19
Secretary of Energy shall carry out research, development, 
20
demonstration, and commercial application activities to 
21
improve the following: 
22
(1) Wind resource data capabilities in the 
23
200m–800m elevation range onshore and offshore, 
24
including mesoscale modeling techniques.

(2) Airborne wind energy designs and tech-
1
nologies, including the following: 
2
(A) Generators and generator placement. 
3
(B) Design load and structural integrity 
4
across varying concepts, including soft and rigid 
5
wings. 
6
(C) Tether technologies. 
7
(D) Flight operation, such as flying cross-
8
wind or remaining stationary. 
9
(E) Takeoff and landing, including autono-
10
mous landings. 
11
(3) Understanding of social and environmental 
12
impacts of airborne wind energy on wildlife, nearby 
13
communities, radar, and airspace, as well as any 
14
other concerns. 
15
(c) AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.—The fol-
16
lowing are authorized to be appropriated to carry out the 
17
Program: 
18
(1) $5,000,000 for fiscal year 2023. 
19
(2) $5,250,000 for fiscal year 2024. 
20
(3) $5,512,500 for fiscal year 2025.
