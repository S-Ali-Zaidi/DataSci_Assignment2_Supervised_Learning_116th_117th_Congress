SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds that— 
2
(1) air pollution inflicts disproportionate harm 
3
on Black people, Indigenous people, and people of 
4
color; 
5
(2) air quality can vary up to 800 percent from 
6
block to block within a single neighborhood; 
7
(3) it is possible to identify and attribute 
8
sources of pollution based on fingerprint analysis of 
9
multiple pollutants; 
10
(4) existing methods that are prescribed for 
11
basin-wide air quality monitoring— 
12
(A) are cost-prohibitive for monitoring 
13
community-scale air quality; and 
14
(B) do not, as of the date of enactment of 
15
this Act, measure the intrinsic variability of 
16
persistently poor air quality in environmental 
17
justice communities at the neighborhood block 
18
level; and 
19
(5) the Environmental Protection Agency has 
20
existing authority under the Clean Air Act to ad-
21
dress air pollutants, including greenhouse gases.
