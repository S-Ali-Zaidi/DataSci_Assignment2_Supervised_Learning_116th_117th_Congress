A BILL 
To establish the Future of Local News Committee to examine 
and report on the role of local news gathering in sus-
taining democracy in the United States and the factors 
contributing to the demise of local journalism, and to 
propose policies and mechanisms that could reinvigorate 
local news to meet the critical information needs of the 
people of the United States in the 21st century. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Future of Local News 
2
Act’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds and declares the following: 
5
(1) The United States of America was founded 
6
on the press freedom principle enshrined in the First 
7
Amendment to the Constitution, declaring that 
8
‘‘Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the 
9
freedom of speech, or of the press . . . .’’. 
10
(2) Democracy demands wisdom and vision in 
11
its citizens, and an informed citizenry depends on 
12
accurate and unbiased news reporting to inform the 
13
people’s judgments. 
14
(3) Thomas Jefferson famously and wisely 
15
wrote, ‘‘[W]ere it left to me to decide whether we 
16
should have a government without newspapers or 
17
newspapers without a government, I should not hesi-
18
tate a moment to prefer the latter.’’. 
19
(4)(A) According to research by the University 
20
of North Carolina School of Media and Journalism, 
21
Center for Innovation and Sustainability in Local 
22
Media: 
23
(i) The United States has lost more than 
24
2,100 local print outlets since 2004.

•HR 3169 IH
(ii) More than 200 counties in the United 
1
States have no newspaper at all, creating a 
2
news shortage for the 3,200,000 residents of 
3
those counties. 
4
(iii) Of the remaining counties, more than 
5
half, or 1,528, have only one newspaper, often 
6
a weekly newspaper, to cover populations rang-
7
ing from under 1,000 to more than 1,000,000 
8
residents. 
9
(iv) More than half of all United States 
10
newspapers have changed owners in the past 
11
decade, and in 2018 just 25 companies owned 
12
two-thirds of all daily newspapers. 
13
(v) Of the surviving 6,700 newspapers in 
14
the United States, at least 1,000 qualify as 
15
‘‘ghost newspapers’’, or newspapers ‘‘whose re-
16
porting staffs are so significantly reduced that 
17
they can no longer provide much of the break-
18
ing news or public service journalism that once 
19
informed readers about vital issues in their 
20
communities’’. 
21
(vi) Rural counties are among the counties 
22
most deeply impacted. More than 500 of the 
23
2,100 newspapers that have closed or merged 
24
since 2004 have been in rural counties.

(B) According to the Pew Research Center, 
1
total newsroom employment (meaning in news-
2
papers, television, radio, and digital) dropped by 
3
roughly 25 percent from 2008 to 2018, while the 
4
plunge in newspaper newsrooms alone was much 
5
worse, at 47 percent. 
6
(C) According to the program ‘‘On the Media’’ 
7
of WNYC Studios, beat reporting, meaning the day- 
8
to-day coverage of a particular field that allows a 
9
journalist to develop expertise and cultivate sources, 
10
has been gutted. 
11
(D) Freedom of Information Act requests sub-
12
mitted by local newspapers to local, State, and Fed-
13
eral agencies fell by nearly 50 percent between 2005 
14
and 2010, demonstrating a significant drop in the 
15
extent to which reporters request government 
16
records. 
17
(E) According to the Pew Research Center, 
18
newspapers alone lost more than $35,000,000,000 in 
19
advertising revenue between 2004 and 2018. 
20
(F) A 2018 study by American Indian Media 
21
Today found that the number of American Indian 
22
print media sources has shrunk dramatically in re-
23
cent years, from 700 media outlets in 1998 to only 
24
200 in 2018.

(5) According to the Native American Journal-
1
ists Association, Tribal news outlets are often de-
2
pendent on Tribal governments for funding, but 
3
most Tribal news outlets lack the policy structure 
4
necessary to fully protect journalistic independence. 
5
(6) As a result, freedoms of speech and press 
6
among Tribal nations are inconsistent, as Tribal 
7
media journalists report experiencing punitive budg-
8
etary restrictions, censorship, required prior ap-
9
proval of content, and workplace harassment in pur-
10
suit of Tribal reporting. 
11
(7) In its 2019 call-to-action report, ‘‘Losing 
12
the News: The Decimation of Local Journalism and 
13
the Search for Solutions’’, PEN America proposed 
14
‘‘a major reimagining of the local news space, in 
15
which local reporting is re-conceptualized as a public 
16
good’’, calling on society and government to urgently 
17
address the alarming demise of local journalism. 
18
(8) Half a century ago, Congress perceived that 
19
the commercial television industry would not on its 
20
own provide the educational and public interest 
21
broadcasting that was appropriate and necessary for 
22
the country, and, informed by an independent report 
23
prepared by the Carnegie Commission on Edu-
24
cational Television, saw fit to create the Corporation 
25

H3169

•HR 3169 IH
for Public Broadcasting, which has since ensured 
1
that radio and television include public interest edu-
2
cational and reporting programs, using annually ap-
3
propriated funds. 
4
(9) In order to determine an appropriate course 
5
of action to preserve and sustain local news across 
6
the United States, including in all States, territories, 
7
insular communities, and Tribal areas, it is desirable 
8
to establish a Federal advisory committee on the fu-
9
ture of local news to prepare a report that would 
10
make recommendations to Congress.
