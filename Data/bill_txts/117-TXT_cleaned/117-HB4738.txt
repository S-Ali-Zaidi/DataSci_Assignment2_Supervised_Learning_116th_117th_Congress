(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds as follows:

•HR 4738 IH
(1) COVID–19 is a highly infectious respiratory 
1
illness caused by a virus called SARS–CoV–2. This 
2
disease has caused a worldwide pandemic affecting 
3
millions of people and has fundamentally altered the 
4
operations of the world’s cities, businesses, and 
5
schools. 
6
(2) The outbreak of COVID–19 was first de-
7
tected in Wuhan, China, and on January 21, 2020, 
8
the first confirmed case of COVID–19 was diag-
9
nosed in the United States. 
10
(3) The World Health Organization (WHO) de-
11
clared COVID–19 a global pandemic on March 11, 
12
2020, and the President of the United States issued 
13
a national emergency declaration concerning the 
14
pandemic on March 13, 2020. 
15
(4) To date, 194 million individuals have tested 
16
positive for COVID–19. Of those, 35 million are 
17
Americans; that is, more than one of every 10 Amer-
18
icans. Almost 4.2 million people have died from 
19
COVID–19 globally, and over 610,000 deaths have 
20
occurred in the United States. 
21
(5) The first American received the COVID–19 
22
vaccine on December 14, 2020. Since then, 163 mil-
23
lion Americans have been vaccinated and 188.5 mil-
24
lion have received at least one dose. The vaccine be-

came available to every American adult 18 and older 
1
on April 19, 2021. 
2
(6) While there are still remaining cases, and 
3
healthcare professionals and researchers are tire-
4
lessly working to eradicate the disease, it is impor-
5
tant we begin work to fully capture the firsthand 
6
personal stories of those impacted by COVID–19, a 
7
major national event in the history of this country. 
8
(7) Oral histories are of immeasurable value to 
9
historians, researchers, authors, journalists, film 
10
makers, scholars, students, and citizens of all walks 
11
of life. Survivors of the pandemic, survivors of loved 
12
ones who lost their lives to COVID–19, and frontline 
13
healthcare workers should be remembered and can 
14
provide valuable firsthand knowledge on how this 
15
pandemic impacted their everyday lives. 
16
(8) It is in the Nation’s best interest to collect 
17
and catalog oral histories of Americans who were af-
18
fected by the pandemic so that future generations 
19
will have original sources of information regarding 
20
the lives and times of those who lived through or 
21
died from the COVID–19 pandemic and conditions 
22
under which they endured. These accounts will allow 
23
an opportunity for Americans to remember those 
24
who lost their lives and may learn firsthand of the 
25

•HR 4738 IH
heroics, loneliness, horrors, and triumphs of the 
1
healthcare workers who combated this pandemic. 
2
(9) The Library of Congress, as the Nation’s 
3
oldest Federal cultural institution and largest and 
4
most inclusive library in human history, is an appro-
5
priate repository to collect, preserve, and make avail-
6
able to the public an archive of these oral histories. 
7
The Library’s American Folklife Center has exper-
8
tise in the management of documentation projects 
9
and experience in the development of cultural and 
10
educational projects for the public. 
11
(b) PURPOSE.—It is the purpose of this Act to create 
12
a new federally sponsored, authorized, and funded project 
13
that will coordinate at a national level the collection of 
14
video and audio recordings of personal histories and 
15
testimonials, written materials, and photographs of Ameri-
16
cans who contracted COVID–19, individuals who lost fam-
17
ily members and friends to COVID–19, and healthcare 
18
workers who fought to treat the illness. These stories will 
19
inform, assist, and encourage local efforts to preserve the 
20
stories of this pandemic and the ones who lost their battle 
21
to the pandemic.
