SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Iran is the world’s leading state sponsor of 
3
terrorism. It seeks ‘‘death to America’’ and the de-
4
struction of the state of Israel. 
5
(2) Iran’s pursuit of nuclear weapons, its desta-
6
bilizing behavior in the Middle East, its support of 
7
terrorism, its development of ballistic missiles, and 
8
its gross violations of human rights against its own 
9
people and the peoples of the Middle East are a 
10
threat to the national security of the United States, 
11
our allies, and international peace and security. 
12
(3) Iran and its proxies have planned, directed, 
13
sponsored, and funded terrorist plots throughout the 
14
world and on United States soil, including the 2011 
15
attempted assassination of the Saudi Arabian Am-
16
bassador to the United States in Washington, DC, 
17
the 1994 bombing of the Asociacion Mutual Israelita 
18
Argentina in Buenos Aires, Argentina which killed 
19
over 85 people, and the 2012 bus bombing in 
20
Burgas, Bulgaria which killed five Israelis. 
21
(4) According to multiple American Directors of 
22
National Intelligence, Iran has the largest arsenal of 
23
ballistic missiles in the Middle East. Iran is also de-
24
veloping a robust cruise missile arsenal and ad-
25
23:54 Jul 16, 2021
H2718
5 
•HR 2718 IH
vanced drone capability, which threaten American 
1
and allied air and missile defenses. 
2
(5) Iran tests, transfers, and even uses these 
3
systems in military operations abroad. 
4
(6) Iran has given ballistic missiles and associ-
5
ated technology to the Houthis in Yemen, Shiite mi-
6
litias in Iraq, the Assad regime in Syria, and 
7
Hezbollah in Lebanon, and is also helping to traffic 
8
precision-guided munitions parts through the Middle 
9
East to upgrade the rocket forces of its chief proxy, 
10
Hezbollah. 
11
(7) Iran continues to hold Americans hostage, 
12
including 
Baquer 
and 
Siamak 
Namazi, 
Bob 
13
Levinson, and others. 
14
(8) The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action 
15
negotiated by former President Barack Obama was 
16
fatally flawed, did not eliminate Iran’s pathway to a 
17
nuclear weapons, and allowed Iran to retain and re-
18
fine its nuclear weapons capability. 
19
(9) The verification and compliance mecha-
20
nisms of the failed Iran nuclear deal were weak and 
21
insufficient. 
22
(10) The failed Iran nuclear agreement did 
23
nothing to address Iran’s continued development of 
24
23:54 Jul 16, 2021
H2718
6 
•HR 2718 IH
ballistic and cruise missiles capable of delivering nu-
1
clear warheads. 
2
(11) The failed Iran nuclear agreement pro-
3
vided Iran with over $100,000,000,000 in sanctions 
4
relief that was used by Iran to fuel proxy wars 
5
across the Middle East, including supporting the 
6
brutal regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria, and lin-
7
ing the pockets of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard 
8
Corps, Hizballah, Hamas, the Houthis, and the Ira-
9
nian backed terrorist militias in Iraq. 
10
(12) The failed Iran nuclear agreement lifted 
11
the United Nations arms embargo on Iran in Octo-
12
ber 2020, permitting Russia and China to engage in 
13
international arms sales with Iran. This also allows 
14
Iran to proliferate weapons across the world includ-
15
ing to Venezuela and the Assad regime in Syria. 
16
(13) A central strategic flaw of the failed Iran 
17
nuclear deal was the idea that an agreement with 
18
Iran should solely focus on the issue of nuclear 
19
weapons alone, and not address non-nuclear issues. 
20
(14) On May 21, 2018, two weeks after Presi-
21
dent Trump withdrew from the failed Iran nuclear 
22
deal, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made 
23
an address at The Heritage Foundation entitled 
24
‘‘After the Deal: A New Iran Strategy’’ where he an-
25
23:54 Jul 16, 2021
H2718
7 
•HR 2718 IH
nounced that the Trump administration would 
1
‘‘apply unprecedented financial pressure on the Ira-
2
nian regime’’ and laid out twelve demands that 
3
would need to be met by Iran as part of any agree-
4
ment related to the lifting of sanctions, and the re- 
5
establishment of diplomatic and commercial relations 
6
with Iran. 
7
(15) In his remarks on May 21, 2018, Pompeo 
8
stated that ‘‘Iran advanced its march across the 
9
Middle East during the JCPOA. Qasem Soleimani 
10
has been playing with house money that has become 
11
blood money. Wealth created by the West has fueled 
12
his campaigns. Strategically, the Obama administra-
13
tion made a bet that the deal would spur Iran to 
14
stop its rogue state actions and conform to inter-
15
national norms. That bet was a loser with massive 
16
repercussions for all of the people living in the Mid-
17
dle East.’’. 
18
(16) Former President Donald J. Trump’s 
19
maximum pressure campaign on Iran denied the re-
20
gime unprecedented revenue it would have otherwise 
21
spent on terrorism. 
22
(17) On December 31, 2019, Iranian President 
23
Hassan Rouhani admitted that Iran had lost $200 
24
billion in revenue because of U.S. sanctions. 
25

•HR 2718 IH
(18) Iran’s oil minister Bijan Zanganeh on 
1
three separate occasions has likened U.S. sanctions 
2
under the maximum pressure campaign to having 
3
made the economic situation worse than the Iran- 
4
Iraq War (1980–1988). 
5
(19) Iran’s 2019 defense budget cut defense 
6
spending by 28 percent, including a 17 percent cut 
7
to the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, a 
8
designated foreign terrorist organization. 
9
(20) The Iranian rial lost around 70 percent of 
10
its value since the beginning of President Trump’s 
11
maximum pressure campaign. 
12
(21) According to the International Monetary 
13
Fund (IMF), Iran’s accessible foreign exchange re-
14
serves plunged to $4 billion in 2020 from $123 bil-
15
lion in 2018, or a decrease of over 96 percent. 
16
(22) Due to the maximum pressure campaign, 
17
Hezbollah terrorists and Iranian backed militias 
18
were denied resources and were forced to cut sala-
19
ries of their fighters. 
20
(23) During the maximum pressure campaign, 
21
the United States was able to achieve the release of 
22
two hostages in Iran, Xiyue Wang and Michael 
23
White, without lifting sanctions or transferring cash 
24
to Iran.

•HR 2718 IH
(24) Former Special Representative for Syria 
1
Engagement James Jeffery stated on May 20th, 
2
2020, ‘‘We have seen the Iranians pulling in some 
3
of their outlying activities and such in Syria because 
4
of, frankly, financial problems . . . in terms of the 
5
huge success of the Trump administration’s sanc-
6
tions policies against Iran. It’s having a real effect 
7
in Syria.’’. 
8
(25) President Joe Biden has repeatedly 
9
pledged to re-enter the failed Iran nuclear agree-
10
ment and lift sanctions on Iran if Iran comes into 
11
compliance with the agreement. 
12
(26) On March 2, 2021, the Republican Study 
13
Committee’s Steering Committee formally adopted 
14
an official position supporting former President 
15
Trump’s maximum pressure campaign on Iran and 
16
pledged to work to fight against and work to reverse 
17
any and all sanctions relief for Iran unless Iran met 
18
all 12 demands laid out by former Secretary of State 
19
Pompeo. 
20
(27) On March 18, 2021, in an interview with 
21
BBC Persian, President Biden’s Special Envoy for 
22
Iran Robert Malley stated ‘‘President Biden and all 
23
of his senior advisers have said this—the maximum 
24
pressure campaign has failed. It was a failure, a pre-

dicted failure. It hasn’t made life any better for the 
1
Iranian people; it hasn’t made life any better for the

U.S. and the region; it hasn’t brought us any closer

to this better deal that President Trump spoke

about.’’.

SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
6
It is the policy of the United States as follows: 
7

12
fluence and activities in the Middle East. 
13

(4) To require that any new agreement with 
16
Iran should be submitted to the Senate for ratifica-
17
tion as a treaty. 
18
(5) To impose maximum economic pressure on 
19
Iran, and keep all sanctions in place on Iran, until 
20

22
2018:
