RESOLUTION 
Supporting the designation of May 10, 2022, as National 
Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander 
Mental Health Day. 
Whereas the Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific 
Islander (AANHPI) community is among the fastest 
growing population groups in the United States and has 
made significant economic, cultural, and social contribu-
tions; 
Whereas the AANHPI community is extremely diverse in 
terms of socioeconomic levels, education, employment,

language, cultures of origin, acculturation, migrant, and 
colonization status; 
Whereas 76 percent of the estimated 2.3 million AANHPIs 
who meet criteria for a mental health problem do not re-
ceive treatment; 
Whereas AANHPIs have among the lowest rates of utiliza-
tion of mental health services; 
Whereas, in 2019, AANHPI youth ages 15 to 24 in the 
United States were the only racial or ethnic population 
in this age category whose leading cause of death was 
suicide; 
Whereas it is imperative to disaggregate AANHPI population 
data to get an accurate representation of the depth and 
breadth of the mental health issues for each subpopula-
tion so that specific culturally and linguistically appro-
priate solutions can be developed; 
Whereas language access continues to be a critical issue 
whether due to the limited number of providers with the 
necessary language skills to provide in-language services 
or the significant language loss faced by Native Hawaiian 
and Pacific Islander communities due to colonization; 
Whereas there is a need to significantly increase the number 
of providers, including paraprofessionals, representing 
AANHPI communities and providing them with the nec-
essary training and ongoing support; 
Whereas historical discrimination and current racial violence 
toward AANHPIs increases trauma and stress, under-
lying precursors to mental health problems; 
Whereas there is a critical need to raise awareness about and 
improve mental health literacy among the AANHPI com-

munity to reduce the stigma associated with mental 
health issues; 
Whereas May is Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, an 
opportunity to celebrate the vast contributions of the 
AANHPI population to American society; and 
Whereas May is also Mental Health Awareness Month, recog-
nizing the importance of mental health to the well-being 
and health of families and communities and connecting 
the importance of one’s cultural heritage to good mental
