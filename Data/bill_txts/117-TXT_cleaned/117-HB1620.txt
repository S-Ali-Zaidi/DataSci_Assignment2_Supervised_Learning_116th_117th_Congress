TITLE VII—ECONOMIC SECURITY

FOR VICTIMS 
21
SEC. 701. FINDINGS. 
22
Congress finds the following: 
23
(1) Over 1 in 3 women experience sexual vio-
24
lence, and 1 in 5 women have survived completed or 
25
19:09 Mar 09, 2021

attempted rape. Such violence has a devastating im-
1
pact on women’s physical and emotional health, fi-
2
nancial security, and ability to maintain their jobs, 
3
and thus impacts interstate commerce and economic 
4
security. 
5
(2) The Office on Violence Against Women of 
6
the Department of Justice defines domestic violence 
7
as a pattern of abusive behavior in any relationship 
8
that is used by one intimate partner to gain or 
9
maintain power and control over another intimate 
10
partner. Domestic violence can include physical, sex-
11
ual, emotional, economic, or psychological actions or 
12
threats of actions that influence another person. Do-
13
mestic violence includes any behaviors that intimi-
14
date, manipulate, humiliate, isolate, frighten, ter-
15
rorize, coerce, threaten, blame, hurt, injure, or 
16
wound an individual. 
17
(3) The Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
18
vention report that domestic violence or intimate 
19
partner violence is a serious public health issue for 
20
millions of individuals in the United States. Nearly 
21
1 in 4 women and 1 in 9 men in the United States 
22
have suffered sexual violence, physical violence, or 
23
stalking by an intimate partner.

•HR 1620 IH
(4) Transgender and gender non-conforming 
1
people face extraordinary levels of physical and sex-
2
ual violence. 
3
(5) More than 1 in 4 transgender people have 
4
faced bias-driven assault, and this rate is higher for 
5
trans women and trans people of color. 
6
(6) The American Foundation for Suicide Pre-
7
vention has found that transgender and gender non- 
8
conforming people had an elevated prevalence of sui-
9
cide attempts, especially when they have suffered 
10
physical or sexual violence. 
11
(7) Homicide is one of the leading causes of 
12
death for women on the job. Domestic partners or 
13
relatives commit 43 percent of workplace homicides 
14
against women. One study found that intimate part-
15
ner violence resulted in 142 homicides among women 
16
at work in the United States from 2003 to 2008, a 
17
figure which represents 22 percent of the 648 work-
18
place homicides among women during the period. In 
19
fact, in 2010, homicides against women at work in-
20
creased by 13 percent despite continuous declines in 
21
overall workplace homicides in recent years. 
22
(8) Women in the United States are 11 times 
23
more likely to be murdered with guns than women 
24
in other high-income countries. Female intimate 
25
19:09 Mar 09, 2021
H1620
130 
•HR 1620 IH
partners are more likely to be murdered with a fire-
1
arm than all other means combined. The presence of 
2
a gun in domestic violence situations increases the 
3
risk of homicide for women by 500 percent. 
4
(9) Violence can have a dramatic impact on the 
5
survivor of such violence. Studies indicate that 44 
6
percent of surveyed employed adults experienced the 
7
effect of domestic violence in the workplace, and 64 
8
percent indicated their workplace performance was 
9
affected by such violence. Another recent survey 
10
found that 78 percent of offenders used workplace 
11
resources to express anger, check up on, pressure, or 
12
threaten a survivor. Sexual assault, whether occur-
13
ring in or out of the workplace, can impair an em-
14
ployee’s work performance, require time away from 
15
work, and undermine the employee’s ability to main-
16
tain a job. Nearly 50 percent of sexual assault sur-
17
vivors lose their jobs or are forced to quit in the 
18
aftermath of the assaults. 
19
(10) Studies find that 60 percent of single 
20
women lack economic security and 81 percent of 
21
households with single mothers live in economic inse-
22
curity. Significant barriers that survivors confront 
23
include access to housing, transportation, and child 
24
care. Ninety-two percent of homeless women have 
25
19:09 Mar 09, 2021
H1620
131 
•HR 1620 IH
experienced domestic violence, and more than 50 
1
percent of such women cite domestic violence as the 
2
direct cause for homelessness. Survivors are deprived 
3
of their autonomy, liberty, and security, and face 
4
tremendous threats to their health and safety. 
5
(11) The Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
6
vention report that survivors of severe intimate part-
7
ner violence lose nearly 8 million days of paid work, 
8
which is the equivalent of more than 32,000 full- 
9
time jobs and almost 5,600,000 days of household 
10
productivity each year. Therefore, women dispropor-
11
tionately need time off to care for their health or to 
12
find safety solutions, such as obtaining a restraining 
13
order or finding housing, to avoid or prevent further 
14
violence. 
15
(12) Annual costs of intimate partner violence 
16
are estimated to be more than $8,300,000,000. Ac-
17
cording to the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
18
vention, the costs of intimate partner violence 
19
against women in 1995 exceeded an estimated 
20
$5,800,000,000. 
These 
costs 
included 
nearly 
21
$4,100,000,000 in the direct costs of medical and 
22
mental health care and nearly $1,800,000,000 in the 
23
indirect costs of lost productivity. These statistics 
24
are generally considered to be underestimated be-
25

H1620
132 
•HR 1620 IH
cause the costs associated with the criminal justice 
1
system are not included. 
2
(13) Fifty-five percent of senior executives re-
3
cently surveyed said domestic violence has a harmful 
4
effect on their company’s productivity, and more 
5
than 70 percent said domestic violence negatively af-
6
fects attendance. Seventy-eight percent of human re-
7
sources professionals consider partner violence a 
8
workplace issue. However, more than 70 percent of 
9
United States workplaces have no formal program or 
10
policy that addresses workplace violence, let alone 
11
domestic violence. In fact, only four percent of em-
12
ployers provided training on domestic violence. 
13
(14) Studies indicate that one of the best pre-
14
dictors of whether a survivor will be able to stay 
15
away from his or her abuser is the degree of his or 
16
her economic independence. However, domestic vio-
17
lence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking 
18
often negatively impact a survivor’s ability to main-
19
tain employment. 
20
(15) Abusers frequently seek to exert financial 
21
control over their partners by actively interfering 
22
with their ability to work, including preventing their 
23
partners from going to work, harassing their part-
24
ners at work, limiting their partners’ access to cash 
25

or transportation, and sabotaging their partners’ 
1
child care arrangements. 
2
(16) Economic abuse refers to behaviors that 
3
control an intimate partner’s ability to acquire, use, 
4
and maintain access to, money, credit, ownership of 
5
assets, or access to governmental or private financial 
6
benefits, including defaulting on joint obligations 
7
(such as school loans, credit card debt, mortgages, 
8
or rent). Other forms of such abuse may include pre-
9
venting someone from attending school, threatening 
10
to or actually terminating employment, controlling 
11
or withholding access to cash, checking, or credit ac-
12
counts, and attempting to damage or sabotage the 
13
creditworthiness of an intimate partner, including 
14
forcing an intimate partner to write bad checks, 
15
forcing an intimate partner to default on payments 
16
related to household needs, such as housing, or forc-
17
ing an intimate partner into bankruptcy. 
18
(17) The Patient Protection and Affordable 
19
Care Act (Public Law 111–148), and the amend-
20
ments made by such Act, ensures that most health 
21
plans must cover preventive services, including 
22
screening and counseling for domestic violence, at no 
23
additional cost. In addition, it prohibits insurance

TITLE IX—SAFETY FOR INDIAN 
20
WOMEN 
21
SEC. 901. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. 
22
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
23
(1) American Indians and Alaska Natives are 
24
2.5 times as likely to experience violent crimes—and 
25
19:09 Mar 09, 2021
H1620
166 
•HR 1620 IH
at least 2 times more likely to experience rape or 
1
sexual assault crimes—compared to all other races. 
2
(2) More than 4 in 5 American Indian and 
3
Alaska Native women, or 84.3 percent, have experi-
4
enced violence in their lifetime. 
5
(3) The vast majority of Native victims—96 
6
percent of women and 89 percent of male victims— 
7
report being victimized by a non-Indian. 
8
(4) Native victims of sexual violence are three 
9
times as likely to have experienced sexual violence by 
10
an interracial perpetrator as non-Hispanic White 
11
victims and Native stalking victims are nearly 4 
12
times as likely to be stalked by someone of a dif-
13
ferent race. 
14
(5) While Tribes exercising jurisdiction over 
15
non-Indians have reported significant successes, the 
16
inability to prosecute crimes related to the Special 
17
Domestic Violence Criminal Jurisdiction crimes con-
18
tinues to leave Tribes unable to fully hold domestic 
19
violence offenders accountable. 
20
(6) Tribal prosecutors report that the majority 
21
of domestic violence cases involve children either as 
22
witnesses or victims, and Department of Justice re-
23
ports that American Indian and Alaska Native chil-
24
19:09 Mar 09, 2021
H1620
167 
•HR 1620 IH
dren suffer exposure to violence at rates higher than 
1
any other race in the United States. 
2
(7) Childhood exposure to violence has imme-
3
diate and long-term effects, including: increased 
4
rates of altered neurological development, poor phys-
5
ical and mental health, poor school performance, 
6
substance abuse, and overrepresentation in the juve-
7
nile justice system. 
8
(8) According to the Centers for Disease Con-
9
trol and Prevention, homicide is the third leading 
10
cause of death among American Indian and Alaska 
11
Native women between 10 and 24 years of age and 
12
the fifth leading cause of death for American Indian 
13
and Alaska Native women between 25 and 34 years 
14
of age. 
15
(9) On some reservations, Indian women are 
16
murdered at more than 10 times the national aver-
17
age. 
18
(10) According to a 2010 Government Account-
19
ability Office report, United States Attorneys de-
20
clined to prosecute nearly 52 percent of violent 
21
crimes that occur in Indian country. 
22
(11) Investigation into cases of missing and 
23
murdered Indian women is made difficult for Tribal 
24
19:09 Mar 09, 2021
H1620
168 
•HR 1620 IH
law enforcement agencies due to a lack of resources, 
1
such as— 
2
(A) necessary training, equipment, or 
3
funding; 
4
(B) a lack of interagency cooperation; and 
5
(C) a lack of appropriate laws in place. 
6
(12) Domestic violence calls are among the 
7
most dangerous calls that law enforcement receives. 
8
(13) The complicated jurisdictional scheme that 
9
exists in Indian country— 
10
(A) has a significant negative impact on 
11
the ability to provide public safety to Indian 
12
communities; 
13
(B) has been increasingly exploited by 
14
criminals; and 
15
(C) requires a high degree of commitment 
16
and cooperation among Tribal, Federal, and 
17
State law enforcement officials. 
18
(14) Restoring and enhancing local, Tribal ca-
19
pacity to address violence against women provides 
20
for greater local control, safety, accountability, and 
21
transparency. 
22
(15) In States with restrictive land settlement 
23
acts such as Alaska, ‘‘Indian country’’ is limited, re-
24
sources for local Tribal responses either nonexistent 
25

•HR 1620 IH
or insufficient to meet the needs, jurisdiction unnec-
1
essarily complicated and increases the already high 
2
levels of victimization of American Indian and Alas-
3
ka Native women. According to the Tribal Law and 
4
Order Act Commission Report, Alaska Native 
5
women are over-represented in the domestic violence 
6
victim population by 250 percent; they comprise 19 
7
percent of the State population, but are 47 percent 
8
of reported rape victims. And among other Indian 
9
Tribes, Alaska Native women suffer the highest 
10
rates of domestic and sexual violence in the country. 
11

12
(1) to clarify the responsibilities of Federal,

TITLE XVI—KEEPING CHILDREN 
13
SAFE FROM FAMILY VIOLENCE 
14
SEC. 1601. SHORT TITLE. 
15
This title may be cited as the ‘‘Keeping Children Safe 
16
From Family Violence Act’’ or ‘‘Kayden’s Law’’. 
17
SEC. 1602. FINDINGS. 
18
Congress finds the following: 
19
(1) Approximately 15 million children are ex-
20
posed each year to domestic violence and/or child 
21
abuse. 
22
(2) Most child abuse is perpetrated in the fam-
23
ily and by a parent. Intimate partner violence and 
24
child abuse overlap in the same families at rates of 
25

•HR 1620 IH
30 to 60 percent. A child’s risk of abuse increases 
1
after a perpetrator of intimate partner violence sepa-
2
rates from their domestic partner, even when the 
3
perpetrator had not previously directly abused the 
4
child. Children who have witnessed intimate partner 
5
violence are approximately four times more likely to 
6
experience direct child maltreatment than children 
7
who have not witnessed intimate partner violence. 
8
(3) More than 75 percent of child sexual abuse 
9
is perpetrated by a family member or a person 
10
known to the child. U.S. Department of Justice data 
11
shows that family members are almost half (49 per-
12
cent) of the perpetrators of child sex assault victims 
13
under age 6. 
14
(4) Research suggests a child’s exposure to a 
15
batterer is among the strongest indicators of risk of 
16
incest victimization. One study found female children 
17
whose fathers were batterers of the mother were six- 
18
and-a-half times more likely to experience father- 
19
daughter incest than female children who do not 
20
have an abusive father. 
21
(5) Child abuse is a major public health issue 
22
in the United States. Total lifetime financial costs 
23
associated with just one year of confirmed cases of 
24
child maltreatment (including child physical abuse, 
25

•HR 1620 IH
sexual abuse, psychological abuse and neglect) re-
1
sults in $124 billion in annual costs to the U.S. 
2
economy, or approximately one percent of the gross 
3
domestic product. 
4
(6) Empirical research indicates that allegations 
5
of child physical and sexual abuse are regularly dis-
6
counted by courts when raised in child custody 
7
cases, with fewer than one-fourth of claims that a 
8
father has committed child physical or sexual abuse 
9
believed; and where the allegedly abusive parent 
10
claimed the mother was ‘‘alienating’’ the child, only 
11
1 out of 51 claims of sexual molestation by a father 
12
were believed. Independent research indicates that 
13
child sexual abuse allegations are credible 50 to 70 
14
percent of the time. 
15
(7) Empirical research shows that alleged or 
16
known abusive parents are often granted custody or 
17
unprotected parenting time by courts. Approximately 
18
one-third of parents alleged to have committed child 
19
abuse took primary custody from the protective par-
20
ent reporting the abuse, placing children at ongoing 
21
risk. 
22
(8) Researchers have documented nearly 800 
23
children murdered in the United States since 2008 
24
by a divorcing or separating parent. More than 100 
25
19:09 Mar 09, 2021
H1620
251 
•HR 1620 IH
of these child murders are known to have occurred 
1
after a court ordered the child into contact with the 
2
dangerous parent over the objection of a safe parent 
3
or caregiver. 
4
(9) Scientifically unsound theories that treat 
5
mothers’ abuse allegations as likely false attempts to 
6
undermine the father are frequently applied in fam-
7
ily court to minimize or deny parents’ and children’s 
8
reports of abuse. Many experts who testify against 
9
abuse allegations lack expertise in the relevant type 
10
of alleged abuse, relying instead on unsound and 
11
unproven theories. 
12
(10) Judges presiding over custody cases with 
13
allegations of child abuse, child sexual abuse, and 
14
domestic violence are rarely required to receive 
15
training on these subjects, nor have most states es-
16
tablished standards for such trainings. 
17
SEC. 1603. PURPOSES. 
18
The purposes of this title are to: 
19
(1) increase the priority given to child safety in 
20
any private state court proceeding affecting chil-
21
dren’s care and custody, excluding child protective 
22
and social service proceedings; 
23
(2) strengthen courts’ abilities to recognize and 
24
adjudicate domestic violence and child abuse allega-

tions based on valid, admissible evidence, and to 
1
enter orders which protect and minimize the risk of 
2
harm to children as the first priority; and 
3
(3) ensure that professional personnel involved 
4
in cases containing abuse allegations receive trauma- 
5
informed and culturally appropriate training on the 
6
dynamics, signs and impact of domestic violence and 
7
child abuse, including child sexual abuse.
