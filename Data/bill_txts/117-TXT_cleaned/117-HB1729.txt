SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds that— 
2
(1) article I of the Constitution of the United 
3
States guarantees the people of the United States 
4
the right to enact public policy through the free and 
5
fair election of representatives and through the ac-
6
tions of State legislatures and Congress; 
7
(2) banks rightly objected to the Operation 
8
Choke Point initiative through which certain govern-
9
ment agencies pressured banks to cut off access to 
10
financial services to lawful sectors of the economy; 
11
(3) banks are now, however, increasingly em-
12
ploying subjective, category-based evaluations to 
13
deny certain persons access to financial services in 
14
response to pressure from advocates from across the 
15
political spectrum whose policy objectives are served 
16
when banks deny certain customers access to finan-
17
cial services; 
18
(4) the privatization of the discriminatory prac-
19
tices underlying Operation Choke Point by banks 
20
represents as great a threat to the national economy, 
21
national security, and the soundness of banking and 
22
financial markets in the United States as Operation 
23
Choke Point itself; 
24
(5) banks are supported by the United States 
25
taxpayers and enjoy significant privileges in the fi-

nancial system of the United States and should not 
1
be permitted to act as de facto regulators or 
2
unelected legislators by withholding financial services 
3
to otherwise credit worthy businesses based on sub-
4
jective political reasons, bias or prejudices; 
5
(6) banks are not well-equipped to balance risks 
6
unrelated to financial exposures and the operations 
7
required to deliver financial services; 
8
(7) the United States taxpayers came to the aid 
9
for large banks during the great recession of 2008 
10
because they were deemed too important to the na-
11
tional economy to be permitted to fail; 
12
(8) when a bank predicates the access to finan-
13
cial services of a person on factors or information 
14
(such as the lawful products a customer manufac-
15
tures or sells or the services the customer provides) 
16
other than quantitative, impartial risk-based stand-
17
ards, the bank has failed to act consistent with basic 
18
principles of sound risk management and failed to 
19
provide fair access to financial services; 
20
(9) banks have a responsibility to make deci-
21
sions about whether to provide a person with finan-
22
cial services on the basis of impartial criteria free 
23
from prejudice or favoritism;

(10) while fair access to financial services does 
1
not obligate a bank to offer any particular financial 
2
service to the public, or to operate in any particular 
3
geographic area, or to provide a service the bank of-
4
fers to any particular person, it is necessary that— 
5
(A) the financial services a bank chooses to 
6
offer in the geographic areas in which the bank 
7
operates be made available to all customers 
8
based on the quantitative, impartial risk-based 
9
standards of the bank, and not based on wheth-
10
er the customer is in a particular category of 
11
customers; 
12
(B) banks assess the risks posed by indi-
13
vidual customers on a case-by-case basis, rather 
14
than category-based assessment; and 
15
(C) banks implement controls to manage 
16
relationships commensurate with these risks as-
17
sociated with each customer, not a strategy of 
18
total avoidance of particular industries or cat-
19
egories of customers; 
20
(11) banks are free to provide or deny financial 
21
services to any individual customer, but first, the

banks must rely on empirical data that are evaluated

consistent with the established, impartial risk-man-

The purposes of this Act are to— 
8
(1) ensure fair access to financial services and 
9
fair treatment of customers by financial service pro-
10
viders, including national and State banks, Federal 
11
savings associations, and State and Federal credit 
12
unions; 
13
(2) ensure banks conduct themselves in a safe 
14
and sound manner, comply with laws and regula-
15
tions, treat their customers fairly, and provide fair 
16
access to financial services; 
17
(3) protect against banks being able to impede 
18
otherwise lawful commerce and thereby achieve cer-
19
tain public policy goals; 
20
(4) ensure that persons involved in politically 
21
unpopular businesses but that are lawful under Fed-
22
eral law receive fair access to financial services 
23
under the law; and

using empirical data evaluated under quantifiable
