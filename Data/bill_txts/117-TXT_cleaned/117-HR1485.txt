the 2017 suicide rate for the most rural counties was 1.8 
times higher than the suicide rate for the most urban 
counties;

sionals in rural areas;

more susceptible to negative public attitudes in small 
communities;

Planning and Evaluation of the Department of Health 
and Human Services show that uninsured rates in rural 
areas have been 2 to 3 percentage points higher than in 
urban areas over the 2010 to 2019 period; and 
Whereas, to improve mental health services and delivery in 
rural America, the United States must first raise greater 
public awareness of the current challenges: Now, there-
fore, be it
