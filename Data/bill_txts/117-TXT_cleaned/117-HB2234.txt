A BILL 
To ensure affordable abortion coverage and care for every 
person, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Equal Access to Abor-
4
tion Coverage in Health Insurance Act of 2021’’ or the 
5
‘‘EACH Act of 2021’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
7
Congress makes the following findings: 
8
(1) All people should have access to abortion 
9
services regardless of actual or perceived race, color, 
10
ethnicity, language, ancestry, citizenship, immigra-
11
tion status, sex (including a sex stereotype; preg-
12
nancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition; 
13
sexual orientation or gender identity; and sex char-
14
acteristics), age, disability, or sex work status or be-
15
havior.

(2) A person’s income level, wealth, or type of 
1
insurance should not prevent them from having ac-
2
cess to a full range of pregnancy-related health care, 
3
including abortion services. 
4
(3) No person should have the decision to have, 
5
or not to have, an abortion made for them based on 
6
the ability or inability to afford the health care serv-
7
ice. 
8
(4) Since 1976, the Federal Government has 
9
banned the use of Federal funds to pay for abortion 
10
services and allows for exceptions only in very nar-
11
row circumstances. This ban affects people of repro-
12
ductive age in the United States who are insured 
13
through the Medicaid program, as well as individuals 
14
who receive insurance or care through other feder-
15
ally-funded health programs and plans. 
16
(5) Women make up the majority of Medicaid 
17
enrollees (54 percent) and, in 2019, approximately 
18
14 million women of reproductive age relied on the 
19
program for care. Due to systematic barriers and 
20
discrimination, a disproportionately higher number 
21
of women of color and Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, 
22
Transgender, or Queer (LGBTQ) individuals are en-
23
rolled in the program.

(6) Women of color are more likely to be in-
1
sured by the Medicaid program. Nationwide, 29 per-
2
cent of Black women and 25 percent of Hispanic 
3
women aged 15–49 were enrolled in Medicaid in 
4
2018 , compared with 15 percent of white women. 
5
(7) In the aggregate, nearly one-fifth (19 per-
6
cent) of Asian American and Pacific Islander women 
7
are enrolled in the Medicaid program, while enroll-
8
ment rates for certain Asian ethnic subgroups are 
9
much higher (at 62 percent of Bhutanese women, 43 
10
percent of Hmong women and 32 percent of Paki-
11
stani women). 
12
(8) Medicaid also provides coverage to more 
13
than one in four (27 percent) nonelderly American 
14
Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) adults and half of 
15
AIAN children. 
16
(9) In a 2014 nationwide survey of LGBT peo-
17
ple with incomes less than 400 percent Federal Pov-
18
erty Level (FPL), 61 percent of all respondents had 
19
incomes in the Medicaid expansion range—up to 
20
138 percent of the FPL—including 73 percent of 
21
African-American respondents, 67 percent of Latino 
22
respondents, and 53 percent of white respondents. 
23
Another survey found that 32 percent of Asian and 
24

Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander transgender people 
1
were living in poverty. 
2
(10) Of women aged 15–44 enrolled in Med-
3
icaid in 2018, 55 percent lived in the 34 States and 
4
the District of Columbia where Medicaid does not 
5
cover abortion services except in limited cir-
6
cumstances. This amounted to 7.2 million women of 
7
reproductive age, including 3 million women living 
8
below the FPL. Of this population, Black, Indige-
9
nous, and other People of Color (BIPOC) women ac-
10
counted for 51 percent of those enrolled. 
11
(11) The Indian Health Service (IHS) is the 
12
federally funded health program for American Indi-
13
ans and Alaska Natives. The IHS serves a popu-
14
lation of approximately 2.56 million and as a feder-
15
ally funded system, since 1988, it has been barred 
16
from providing abortion services except for very lim-
17
ited cases. American Indians and Alaska Natives 
18
often face higher levels of poverty and limited access 
19
to health care for a number of intersecting oppres-
20
sions thus leaving them without recourse for the fed-
21
eral ban on abortion services. 
22
(12) Moreover, 26 States also prohibit coverage 
23
of abortion services in the marketplaces and 11 pro-
24
hibit coverage in private health insurance plans

under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care 
1
Act of 2010 (Public Law 111–148). 
2
(13) A recent report details how restrictions on 
3
abortion services coverage interfere with a person’s 
4
individual decision-making, with their health and 
5
well-being, with their economic security, with their 
6
vulnerability to intimate partner violence, and with 
7
their constitutionally protected right to a safe and 
8
normal health care service. 
9
(14) About 25 percent of women covered by 
10
Medicaid seeking abortion services must carry their 
11
pregnancies to term because they are unable to ob-
12
tain funds for their care. Government-imposed bar-
13
riers to abortion services restrict people’s decisions 
14
on if, when, and how to parent, and have long-last-
15
ing and life-altering harmful effects on the pregnant 
16
person, their families and their communities. Those 
17
who seek and are denied abortion services are more 
18
likely to remain in or fall into poverty than those 
19
who access the care they need. 
20
(15) Restrictions on abortion service coverage 
21
have a disproportionately harmful impact on women 
22
with low incomes, women of color, immigrant 
23
women, LGBTQ people, and young women. Addi-
24
tionally, numerous state-imposed barriers make it 
25
02:59 May 25, 2021

•HR 2234 IH
disparately difficult for low-income people, people of 
1
color, immigrants, LGBTQ people, and young people 
2
to access the health care and resources necessary to 
3
prevent unintended pregnancy or to assure that they 
4
are able to carry healthy pregnancies to term. Fur-
5
thermore, young people of reproductive age (15–24) 
6
are more likely to have a lower income than those 
7
older than that, and this income gap is greater for 
8
young BIPOC. More than 40 percent of youth and 
9
children under age 19 and almost a quarter of 
10
young people age 19 to 25 have health insurance 
11
through government programs. Without insurance 
12
coverage for abortion services, young people are at 
13
greater risk of not having the economic means to af-
14
ford care outside of insurance. Young people face 
15
disproportionate access barriers to abortion includ-
16
ing parental involvement requirement (notification 
17
and consent) and cost, in addition to barriers to con-
18
traception and inadequate and incomplete sexual(ity) 
19
education. These challenges, which are magnified for 
20
BIPOC and queer, trans, and nonbinary youth, can 
21
cause significant delays in access to needed care, 
22
and could ultimately harm the life of the young per-
23
son seeking abortion services. These institutionalized 
24
barriers deny young people’s right to bodily auton-

omy and can force young people to encounter an 
1
abusive parent or guardian, ignores trusted relation-
2
ships young people may have with adults other than 
3
a parent or legal guardian, and in the case of the 
4
judicial bypass process, may force young BIPOC to 
5
interact with a legal system that has historically tar-
6
geted and caused harm to communities of color. 
7
(16) These and other government-created and 
8
government-institutionalized barriers—including the 
9
restriction on funding for abortion services in Fed-
10
eral programs—exacerbate and create poverty and 
11
racial inequality in income, wealth-generation, and 
12
access to services. 
13
(17) Access to health care, including abortion 
14
services, promotes the general welfare of people liv-
15
ing in the United States. Singling out abortion serv-
16
ices for funding restrictions in health care programs 
17
otherwise designed to promote the health and 
18
wellbeing of people in the United States has cost 
19
pregnant people their lives, their livelihoods, their 
20
ability to obtain or maintain economic security for 
21
themselves and their families, their ability to meet 
22
their family’s basic needs, their ability to continue 
23
their education without disruption, and their ability 
24
to break free of abusive relationships.

(18) Like other health care and health insur-
1
ance markets in the United States, abortion services 
2
and public insurance programs are commercial ac-
3
tivities that affect interstate commerce. Providers 
4
and patients travel across state lines, and otherwise 
5
engage in interstate commerce, to provide and access 
6
abortion services. Material goods, services, and fed-
7
erally-regulated medications used in abortion serv-
8
ices circulate in interstate commerce.

11
other services pursuant to— 
12
(A) its powers under the necessary and
