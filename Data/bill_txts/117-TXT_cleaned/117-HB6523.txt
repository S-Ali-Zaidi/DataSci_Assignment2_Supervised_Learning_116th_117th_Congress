SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Access to AEDs Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE. 
3
The Congress makes the following findings: 
4
(1) Heart disease is the leading cause of death 
5
in the United States. 
6
(2) Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is a life- 
7
threatening emergency that is caused by a malfunc-
8
tion in the heart’s electrical system or structure, 
9
which is caused by an abnormality from birth or one 
10
that develops over time. 
11
(3) Studies show that 1 in 300 youth has an 
12
undetected heart condition that puts them at risk. 
13
(4) SCA is the leading cause of death for stu-
14
dent athletes. 
15
(5) Sports-related SCA accounted for 39 per-
16
cent of SCAs among children 18 years old or young-
17
er. 
18
(6) In 2018, there were nearly 394,000 sudden 
19
cardiac arrests that occurred in the United States, 
20
with 9 out of 10 being fatal. Only 1 in 10 victims 
21
survive a sudden cardiac arrest. 
22
(7) An estimated 7,000 to 23,000 young people 
23
are stricken by SCA annually.

(8) The American Heart Association estimates 
1
that 5 in 10 victims of SCA could survive if bystand-
2
ers gave CPR and used an AED immediately. 
3
(9) The chain of survival includes prompt noti-
4
fication of emergency services and early CPR, 
5
defibrillation, and advanced cardiac life support. 
6
(10) Health education should include basic 
7
emergency lifesaving skills. Incorporating these life-
8
saving training programs into the health curriculum 
9
of elementary and secondary schools will give school 
10
children these skills.
