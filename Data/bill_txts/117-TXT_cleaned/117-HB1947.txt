ing renters is substantial and has contributed to a 
1
growing rental income shortfall throughout the econ-
2
omy during the pandemic; 
3
(2) while other economic stimulus efforts have 
4
been very important, there is a gap in rental pay-
5
ments; 
6
(3) rigorous research shows that tenant-based 
7
housing vouchers, which help families afford decent 
8
stable housing in the private market, are the single 
9
most effective policy for reducing homelessness, 
10
housing instability, and overcrowding among ex-
11
tremely low-income persons; and 
12
(4) the Federal response must include, in the 
13
near term, an increase in the amount of provided 
14
under direct rental assistance programs, which are 
15
varied and can interact with the public through a va-
16
riety of different methods.
