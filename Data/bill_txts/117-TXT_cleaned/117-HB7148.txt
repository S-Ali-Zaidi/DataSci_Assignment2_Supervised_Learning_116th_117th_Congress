Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Bunker Buster Act’’.

Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) The United States Nuclear Regulatory 
7
Commission defines ‘‘high-enriched uranium’’ as

uranium enriched to at least 20 percent uranium– 
1
235. 
2
(2) Under the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan 
3
of Action, Iran agreed to refrain from producing en-
4
riched uranium containing more than 3.67 percent 
5
uranium–235 for 15 years. 
6
(3) On January 13, 2019, the head of the 
7
Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, Dr. Ali Akbar 
8
Salehi, told the Fars News Agency, ‘‘If we want to 
9
come out of the nuclear deal and produce, within 
10
four days we could start our 20 percent.’’. 
11
(4) On June 17, 2019, the spokesman for 
12
Iran’s 
Atomic 
Energy 
Organization, 
Behrouz 
13
Kamalvandi, suggested that Iran’s enrichment could 
14
reach up to 20 percent. 
15
(5) On April 16, 2021, the head of the Atomic 
16
Energy Organization of Iran, Dr. Ali Akbar Salehi, 
17
told the state television that Iran had begun enrich-
18
ing uranium to 60 percent. 
19
(6) On July 14, 2021, the former President of 
20
Iran, President Hassan Rouhani, says during a 
21
press conference that Iran has the knowledge and 
22
ability to enrich weapons-grade uranium at 90 per-
23
cent.

•HR 7148 IH
(7) On September 7, 2021, the International 
1
Atomic Energy Agency warned in their quarterly re-
2
port of the knowledge gained by Iran about ad-
3
vanced centrifuge performance and higher-level en-
4
richment that cannot be fully reversed. The report 
5
showed that the stockpile of 60 percent enriched 
6
uranium grew from 2.4 kilograms in May to 10 kilo-
7
grams. It also indicated Iran reconfigured its 60 
8
percent production lines at Natanz and appears to 
9
be enriching to that level more efficiently and con-
10
sistently. 
11
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
12
It is the sense of Congress that the United States 
13
should— 
14
(1) seek to extend the limitations on Iran’s en-
15
riched uranium, including through engagement in 
16
multilateral diplomatic initiatives; 
17
(2) ensure that Israel and other allies are pre-
18
pared for all contingencies if Iran pursues develop-
19
ment of a nuclear weapon; 
20
(3) send a clear signal to Iran that development 
21
of a nuclear weapon will never be tolerated; and 
22
(4) reaffirm the United States commitment to 
23
deter Iranian nuclear development with a credible 
24
military threat.

8
nuclear weapon. Such study shall include an analysis of 
9
gaps in Israel’s security requirements, including infra-

the extent to which the transfer of United States ordnance 
12
to Israel would advance the national interests of both 
13
countries.
