RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the designation of the week of Sep-
tember 19 through September 25, 2021, as ‘‘Purple Star 
Families Week’’. 
Whereas it is recognized that wounds sustained through 
armed service to the United States of America are both 
visible and invisible; 
Whereas these invisible wounds are frequently undertreated 
and poorly healed; 
Whereas the Department of Veterans Affairs has determined 
that an average of more than 20 veterans die by suicide 
per day; 
Whereas veterans account for a disproportionate percentage 
of all adult suicides in the United States;

Whereas surviving family members of veterans who succumb 
to the invisible wounds of war are often forgotten and 
isolated; 
Whereas these family members lose their link to the support 
and strength of the military and veteran communities 
after their loss; 
Whereas the need for formal recognition of these families is 
vital to the strength, health, and survival of the commu-
nity of United States veterans; 
Whereas these families may be designated for recognition and 
support as ‘‘Purple Star Families’’; and 
Whereas the week of September 19 through September 25, 
2021, is an appropriate week to designate as ‘‘Purple 
Star Families Week’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives supports 
1
the designation of ‘‘Purple Star Families Week’’.
