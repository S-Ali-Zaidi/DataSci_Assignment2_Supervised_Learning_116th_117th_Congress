RESOLUTION 
Recognizing ‘‘Banned Books Week’’ and the sweeping attacks 
on books in the United States today, acknowledging the 
central role books play in promoting democratic and civil 
discourse, and urging recognition of the illegitimate tac-
tics being used to ban books in K–12 classrooms, univer-
sities, prisons, and libraries. 
Whereas the First Amendment of the Constitution protects

Whereas Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human

Whereas an increasing number of book bans have departed 
from best practice guidelines outlined by the National Co-
alition Against Censorship, the National Council of 
Teachers of English, and the American Library Associa-
tion; 
Whereas the sharing of all ideas and the freedom to read are 
essential for a strong democracy; 
Whereas books do not require readers to agree with topics or 
themes but instead allow readers to explore and engage 
with differing perspectives to form and inform their own 
views; 
Whereas suppressing the freedom to read and denying access 
to literature, history, and knowledge are inherently 
illiberal and antidemocratic tactics used by authoritarian 
regimes against their people; 
Whereas book bans often seek to impose restrictions on all 
students and families based on the political, ideological, 
or cultural preferences of the individuals calling for book 
bans; 
Whereas book bans have multifaceted, harmful consequences 
on—

(1) students who have a right to access a diverse 
range of stories and perspectives; 
(2) students, from historically marginalized back-
grounds, whose communities are often underrepresented 
in literature; 
(3) educators and librarians who are operating in 
some states in an increasingly punitive and surveillance- 
oriented environment with a chilling effect on teaching 
and learning; 
(4) the authors whose works are being targeted; and 
(5) parents who want to raise students in schools 
that remain open to curiosity, discovery, and the freedom 
to read; 
Whereas classic and award-winning literature and books that

Margaret Atwood, ‘‘Anne Frank’s Diary: The Graphic 
Adaptation’’, ‘‘Their Eyes Were Watching God’’ by Zora 
Neale Hurston, and ‘‘To Kill a Mockingbird’’ by Harper

Whereas 674 books referring to LGBTQ+ themes or with 
LGBTQ+ characters have been banned in the United 
States this year, including children’s books such as

depict the vital diversity of American civic life, and the 
painful historical realities of the human experience, in-
cluding in the Holocaust; 
Whereas books addressing death, grief, mental illness, and 
suicide are targeted alongside nonfiction books that dis-
cuss feelings and emotions written for teenage and young 
adult audiences that confront these topics frequently; 
Whereas soft censorship, the quiet removal or hiding of 
books, presents a subtle challenge that may be obscuring 
the magnitude of the problem; 
Whereas educators throughout the country have been tar-
geted for simply teaching students the truth about 
United States history including, for example, the extreme 
action by the Oklahoma secretary of education in seeking 
to revoke the teaching certificate of an educator who 
merely provided students a link to Brooklyn Public Li-
brary’s Books Unbanned project, which provides young

pose book bans; 
Whereas an overwhelming majority of American voters sup-
port educators teaching about the Civil Rights Movement, 
the history and experiences of Native Americans, 
enslaved Africans, immigrants facing discrimination, and

Whereas, in 1969, the Supreme Court held in Tinker v. Des 
Moines Independent Community School District that stu-
dents do not ‘‘shed their constitutional rights to freedom
