(a) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this section is to pro-
8
vide for the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, 
9
and Medicine (in this section referred to as the ‘‘Acad-
10
emies’’), an independent nonprofit scientific organization

14
posure to toxic substances.

3
agreement between the Secretary and the Academies

under this section, the Academies shall review and summa-
5
rize the scientific evidence, and assess the strength there-

(d) SCIENTIFIC DETERMINATIONS CONCERNING DIS-
11
EASES.—For each disease reviewed under subsection (c),

the Academies shall determine, to the extent that available

scientific data permit meaningful determinations— 
14
(1) whether an association exists between expo-
15

disease, taking into account the strength of the sci-
17
entific evidence and the appropriateness of the sta-
18
tistical and epidemiological methods used to detect 
19
the association;

(2) the increased risk of the disease among 
21
those exposed to toxic substances during active mili-
22
tary, naval, or air service; and

(3) whether there exists a plausible biological 
24
mechanism or other evidence of a causal relationship
