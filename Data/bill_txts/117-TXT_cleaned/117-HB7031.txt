A BILL 
To amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to modify 
the application and review process for changes of control, 
and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Change of Ownership 
4
and Conversion Improvement Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Institutions of higher education in the 
8
United States frequently merge with, consolidate, 
9

•HR 7031 IH
and acquire other institutions that result in a 
1
change in ownership. 
2
(2) These transactions are generally good for 
3
students, as they promote innovation, drive competi-
4
tion, and prevent stagnation. 
5
(3) Changing demographics and evolving higher 
6
education enrollment patterns may lead to more 
7
mergers and acquisitions in the future. 
8
(4) Proprietary institutions that voluntarily 
9
convert to nonprofit status or are acquired by non-
10
profit and public entities can have a positive impact 
11
on students and society. 
12
(5) The Department of Education has an inter-
13
est in safeguarding Federal student aid funds and 
14
therefore should conduct thorough and comprehen-
15
sive reviews of all changes in ownership involving in-
16
stitutions of higher education. 
17
(6) These reviews are necessary to ensure that 
18
the acquiring entity has the financial and adminis-
19
trative capacity to manage the target institutions. 
20
(7) The Department of Education should con-
21
duct these reviews in a thorough and comprehensive 
22
manner but should do so as quickly as possible to 
23
promote the execution of these transactions. 
24

•HR 7031 IH
(8) As of May 2021, the Department of Edu-
1
cation had ‘‘very few staff’’ assigned to evaluate 
2
pretransaction, change of control, and conversion ap-
3
plications on a full-time basis. 
4
(9) Consequently, these transactions are proc-
5
essed by the Department of Education at an ex-
6
traordinary slow rate of speed, with some institu-
7
tions waiting up to 5 years before receiving a final 
8
determination. 
9
(10) One of the primary challenges in proc-
10
essing these applications quickly is the lack of fund-
11
ing to hire enough qualified staff. 
12
(11) Currently, general taxpayers are bearing 
13
the cost of reviewing these transactions. 
14
(12) It is in the interest of institutions and the 
15
United States to charge a fee for applications involv-
16
ing changes in ownership at institutions of higher 
17
education that are submitted to the Department of 
18
Education. 
19
(13) In consideration for the fee, the Depart-
20
ment of Education will be required to guarantee an 
21
expedited review process for all applicants, absent 
22
compelling circumstances where good cause exists 
23
for delay.

•HR 7031 IH
(14) The Government Accountability Office has 
1
identified weaknesses in the Department of Edu-
2
cation’s post-transaction monitoring process, which 
3
will likewise require additional staff to be hired to 
4
conduct monitoring. 
5
(15) Institutions that have converted from pro-
6
prietary status to nonprofit status and have an on-
7
going financial relationship with the former owners 
8
of the institution are at highest risk of entering into 
9
financial arrangements that result in improper pri-
10
vate inurement. 
11
(16) These institutions should be closely mon-
12
itored for a period after these transactions occur and 
13
should be required to pay a fee to support the hiring 
14
of staff to conduct this monitoring. 
15
(17) The Government Accountability Office has 
16
likewise found weaknesses in the Internal Revenue 
17
Service review process for conversion requests and 
18
the post-transaction monitoring process. 
19
(18) In order to support a more thorough re-
20
view of these applications and to conduct moni-
21
toring, the Department of Education will remit part 
22
of the fee paid by institutions to the Internal Rev-
23
enue Service for these purposes.
