SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS. 
1
(a) SHORT TITLE.—This Act may be cited as the 
2
‘‘LEO Fair Retirement Act of 2022’’. 
3
(b) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
4
(1) Federal law enforcement officers are never 
5
‘‘off-duty’’. They are counted on to respond at any 
6
time of the day or night, regardless of their official 
7
duty status, to protect the public safety. Outside of 
8
our Nation’s Armed Forces, theirs is the only pro-
9
fession comprised of individuals who are routinely 
10
called upon to put their lives on the line to keep 
11
America safe. 
12
(2) Though the Federal Government may house 
13
the largest variety of occupations of any U.S. em-
14
ployer across its panoply of agencies and entities, 
15
Federal law enforcement is absolutely unique among 
16
them, and the Federal law enforcement officer has 
17
no counterpart in the private sector. It is one of the 
18
most stressful, most dangerous, and most rewarding 
19
careers for those who meet the rigorous require-
20
ments of the job. 
21
(3) It was in recognition of the unique nature 
22
of the occupation, and the demanding schedules re-
23
quired of those who fill its ranks, that Congress es-
24
tablished distinct pay and benefit systems for Fed-
25

•HR 8087 IH
eral law enforcement positions. This includes basic 
1
pay, retirement, and even overtime compensation. 
2
(4) Under current law, however, the payment of 
3
overtime compensation is limited, and is only pay-
4
able to the extent that the payments do not cause 
5
the aggregate of the law enforcement officer’s bi-
6
weekly or annual pay to exceed the pay caps estab-
7
lished under section 5547 of title 5, United States 
8
Code. This often results in a law enforcement officer 
9
working significant amounts of overtime hours year 
10
after year for which the officer is never com-
11
pensated. 
12
(5) In light of the continuing homeland and na-
13
tional security threats facing our Nation, it is in the 
14
interest of the Federal Government to ensure that it 
15
can continue to recruit and retain the highest caliber 
16
personnel by allowing Federal law enforcement offi-
17
cers the opportunity to reclaim full credit in retire-
18
ment for overtime hours worked but never paid.
