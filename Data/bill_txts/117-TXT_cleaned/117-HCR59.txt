CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 
Condemning the October 25, 2021, military coup in Sudan 
and standing with the people of Sudan. 
Whereas the people of the Republic of Sudan suffered for 
three decades under the despotic rule of President Omar 
Hassan Ahmad al-Bashir, whose government was respon-
sible for the suppression of civil liberties, grand corrup-
tion, support for international terrorism, and the commis-
sion of crimes against humanity and genocide; 
Whereas, throughout 2019, a coalition of Sudanese civic 
groups, including professional associations, labor unions, 
community groups, democracy activists, and opposition 
parties, led a mass protest movement to demand the end

of Bashir’s reign and the transition to democracy in 
Sudan; 
Whereas, on April 11, 2019, Sudanese military officers de-
posed Bashir, and, following continued protests, agreed 
to form a transitional government in partnership with a 
civilian pro-democracy coalition on July 17, 2019; 
Whereas, on June 3, 2019, Sudanese forces led by the Rapid 
Support Forces (RSF), largely comprised of Janjaweed 
militia involved in genocidal campaigns across Darfur for 
decades, opened fire on protesters at an army command 
headquarters in Khartoum, killing at least 127 people, at 
least 40 of whom were found in the Nile River; 
Whereas the military and civilian elements agreed to a 39- 
month transition to democracy, with a Civilian-Led Tran-
sitional Government (CLTG) comprised of a predomi-
nantly civilian cabinet led by Prime Minister Abdallah 
Hamdok, a Sovereign Council, an executive body with ci-
vilian and military members chaired for the first half of 
the transitional period by Lieutenant General Abdel 
Fattah al-Burhan, and a Transitional Legislative Coun-
cil, which has yet to be formed; 
Whereas the United States and the international community 
supported Sudan’s transition to democracy, with the 
United States identifying more than $1,000,000,000 in 
foreign assistance, and the multilateral Friends of Sudan 
group pledging $1,800,000,000 from roughly 50 coun-
tries and international organizations; 
Whereas the CLTG made progress in human rights reforms, 
including guaranteeing the people of Sudan freedom of 
religion and gender equality under the transitional con-

stitution, banning female genital mutilation, and decrimi-
nalizing apostasy; 
Whereas, in August 2021, when the Sudanese Cabinet rati-
fied the Rome Statute of the International Criminal 
Court (ICC), the CLTG made progress towards ending 
impunity for abusers of human rights, stating its inten-
tion to deliver Omar al-Bashir to the ICC to stand trial 
for genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity, 
and formed civilian committees to investigate corruption 
and crimes against humanity perpetrated by the Bashir 
regime; 
Whereas the transitional government negotiated a peace 
agreement with several rebel groups, a step towards end-
ing decades of conflict in the regions of Darfur, South 
Kordofan, and Blue Nile, which killed hundreds of thou-
sands of civilians and left more than 3,000,000 people 
displaced within Sudan; 
Whereas Sudan continues to face a serious humanitarian sit-
uation, with an estimated 13,400,000 people, or 29 per-
cent of the population, in need of humanitarian assist-
ance in 2021; 
Whereas Sudan faces a severe economic crisis, exacerbated by 
the COVID–19 pandemic, which caused the price of food 
and consumer goods to increase significantly, while aus-
terity measures imposed to stabilize the economy resulted 
in the reduction or elimination of subsidies for commod-
ities including wheat and fuel; 
Whereas the political tensions between the civilian and mili-
tary elements and within factions of the civilian coalition 
undermined the CLTG and contributed to widespread un-
rest within the Sudanese population relating to a range

of issues, including the economic crisis, ethnic and tribal 
conflict in peripheral regions, and the unsatisfactory pace 
of reforms; 
Whereas, on September 21, 2021, some members of the mili-
tary reportedly attempted a coup d’e´tat against the tran-
sitional government, which failed to depose the govern-
ment but succeeded in precipitating the most serious po-
litical crisis of the transition period; 
Whereas, on October 21, 2021, hundreds of thousands of 
people across Sudan demonstrated in support of demo-
cratic civilian rule, to counter a smaller protest days 
prior demanding the military take complete control of the 
government; 
Whereas, on October 25, 2021, Lieutenant General Burhan, 
with the support of General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, 
also known as ‘‘Hemedti’’, seized control of the govern-
ment, deployed the military to the streets of Khartoum 
and Omdurman, and arrested and detained Prime Min-
ister Hamdok and other civilian officials; 
Whereas the African Union Peace and Security Council con-
vened on October 27, 2021, strongly condemned the 
coup, reaffirmed the mandate of the CLTG, and subse-
quently suspended Sudan from the regional body ‘‘with 
immediate effect . . . until the effective restoration’’ of 
the CLTG; 
Whereas the actions of Lieutenant General Burhan and the 
Sudanese military violate Sudan’s Constitutional Charter 
and threaten to plunge Sudan into isolation and insta-
bility; 
Whereas the United States Government publicly condemned 
the coup, suspended its foreign assistance to Sudan, and
