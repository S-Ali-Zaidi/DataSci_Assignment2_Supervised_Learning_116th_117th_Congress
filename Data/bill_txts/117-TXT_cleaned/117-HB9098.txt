(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
20
gress that— 
21
(1) the United States and the allies of the

(2) the Department should— 
1
(A) prioritize activities to increase domes-
2

3
(B) accelerate efforts to establish a domes-
4
tic high-assay, low-enriched uranium enrich-
5
ment capability; and

(3) if domestic enrichment of high-assay, low- 
7
enriched uranium will not be commercially available

at the scale needed in time to meet the needs of the 
9
advanced nuclear reactor demonstration projects of 
10
the Department, the Secretary shall consider and

12
(A) all viable options to make high-assay,

(C) other countries determined by the Sec-
13
retary to be insecure supply sources with re-

(2) to expeditiously increase domestic produc-
16
tion of high-assay, low-enriched uranium by an an-
17
nual quantity, and in such form, determined by the 
18
Secretary to be sufficient to meet the needs of—
