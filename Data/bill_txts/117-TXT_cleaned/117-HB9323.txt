A BILL 
To establish a task force on child and family economic 
security and stability for economic growth. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Lifting American Chil-
4
dren From Poverty Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) According to the United States Census Bu-
8
reau, poverty rates for children under the age of 18 
9
have increased to 16.1 percent in 2020, from 14.4 
10
16:38 Nov 23, 2022

percent in 2019. The increase means that now 
1
11,600,000 children live in poverty, as opposed to 
2
10,000,000 in 2019. 
3
(2) Data from the Children’s Defense Fund 
4
show that child poverty is an issue that is con-
5
centrated in the American south, with statistics 
6
showing that Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mis-
7
sissippi, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Carolina, 
8
Tennessee, Texas, and West Virginia have over a 
9
quarter of their child population living in poverty. 
10
(3) A 2018 Social Work Research report esti-
11
mated that the annual economic costs of child pov-
12
erty was $36,000,000,000 to $177,000,000,000, 
13
demonstrating how child poverty stalls economic pro-
14
ductivity. 
15
(4) Recent data from the Census Bureau Cur-
16
rent Population Survey shows that child poverty in-
17
creased sharply during the COVID–19 pandemic 
18
among Black and Latino families. More specifically, 
19
child poverty rose by 4.2 percent in Latino families 
20
and 2.8 percent in Black families. 
21
(5) A report from the Urban Institute dem-
22
onstrates that poverty is closely associated with a 
23
lack of educational achievement. For instance, only 
24
16:38 Nov 23, 2022
H9323
3 
•HR 9323 IH
64 percent of persistently poor children graduate 
1
from high school. 
2
(6) The problem of child poverty also acutely 
3
affects children of color, with 1 in 5 living in pov-
4
erty. Another statistic from the Children’s Defense 
5
Fund (2019) shows that 71 percent of children liv-
6
ing in poverty were children of color. Children of 
7
color are also 2.5 times more likely to live in poverty 
8
than their White counterparts. 
9
(7) The Census Bureau Current Population 
10
Survey also shows that COVID–19 erased recent 
11
gains in the United States toward combating child 
12
poverty. In September 2020, child poverty rates 
13
were at its lowest since 1973. 
14
(8) 3.4 percent of families reported not having 
15
enough to eat prepandemic, but during the pandemic 
16
that number rose to 12 percent according to Center 
17
on Budget and Policy Priorities analysis. Among 
18
households with children, that number was 16 per-
19
cent. 
20
(9) Data published by the National Public 
21
Radio show that the child tax credit cut monthly 
22
child poverty rates by 30 percent and kept 
23
3,700,000 children out of poverty. In addition, 91 
24
percent of low-income families spent the tax credit 
25
16:38 Nov 23, 2022

•HR 9323 IH
on basic needs, such as food. The monthly payments 
1
cut food insufficiency by 25 percent. 
2
SEC. 3. PURPOSE. 
3
The purpose of this Act is to establish an interagency 
4
task force that would create a strategic and comprehensive 
5
plan to reduce child poverty, particularly in States with 
6
higher poverty rates than the national average of 21 per-
7
cent, by— 
8
(1) analyzing the state of child and intergenera-
9
tional poverty and its causes; 
10
(2) creating an inventory of all available Fed-
11
eral programs aimed at reducing child poverty; and 
12
(3) making recommendations for improving the 
13
effectiveness and efficiency of Federal programs that 
14
reduce child poverty.
