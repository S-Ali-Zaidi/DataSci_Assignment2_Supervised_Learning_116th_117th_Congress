RESOLUTION 
Calling for the establishment of an app ratings board to 
enforce consistent and accurate age and content ratings 
of apps on internet-ready devices and calling on tech-
nology companies to ensure the implementation of user- 
friendly and streamlined parental controls on devices 
used by minors. 
Whereas internet-ready devices, and the applications that run 
on such devices, are used by millions of minors daily; 
Whereas the most-downloaded apps often include content that 
is not consistent with the age rating or description of 
such apps;

Whereas clarity in the rating of apps is a critical part of so-
cial responsibility on the part of leading technology com-
panies when including apps in their databases for their 
users to download; 
Whereas parents of minors deserve transparency and accu-
racy in the ratings of apps and the meanings behind 
those ratings; 
Whereas no third-party organization is holding app devel-
opers accountable to ensure that app age ratings are con-
sistent and accurate across devices and that app descrip-
tions adequately explain the content and advertising 
available to minors in such apps; 
Whereas no third-party organization has the authority to im-
pose sanctions for nondisclosure related to app content 
and advertising; 
Whereas apps contain unique risks of both exposure to inap-
propriate content and predators, so a specific app rating 
system that takes these unique risks into account is need-
ed; 
Whereas social media is increasingly being used to recruit 
and sexually exploit young users for sexual abuse or sex 
trafficking; 
Whereas social media is increasingly used for sexual harass-
ment and sexualized bullying, including unsolicited sexu-
ally explicit images, repeated requests for sexually explicit 
imagery, sexual images that are not consensually shared, 
and unwanted exposure to pornographic images; 
Whereas recent studies indicate that excessive use of social 
media, particularly in young girls, can lead to an increase 
in depressive symptoms;

•HRES 721 IH 
Whereas suicide rates, depression, and mental health issues 
among adolescents in the United States have been found 
to increase as social media use has surged within the 
same age group; 
Whereas many providers and users of interactive computer 
services covered by section 230 of the Communications 
Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 230), as added by section 509 
of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, have failed 
to comply with basic best business practices in connection 
with the protection of minors from harmful content, 
therefore instigating interest in a review of the status of 
such providers and users under section 230 unless the 
business practices of such providers and users come into 
alignment with reasonable care and best business prac-
tices of such providers and users appropriate for pro-
tecting minors; 
Whereas popular apps often do not include parental controls 
or have inadequate parental controls; 
Whereas the parental controls provided on internet-ready de-
vices are often insufficient, ignore the age of users, con-
tain loopholes, and are difficult to implement, leaving mi-
nors unprotected from sexual abuse and exploitation; and 
Whereas the improper use of internet-ready devices during 
school hours contributes to student distraction and lower 
test scores and the use of such devices during bedtime 
hours can lead to sleep disturbance: Now, therefore, be 
it
