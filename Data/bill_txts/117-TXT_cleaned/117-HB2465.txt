A BILL 
To allow Americans to earn paid sick time so that they 
can address their own health needs and the health needs 
of their families. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Healthy Families Act’’. 
4
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
5
Congress makes the following findings: 
6
(1) Working people need time to meet their own 
7
health care needs and to care for family members. 
8
The absence of paid sick time has forced working 
9
people to make untenable choices between needed in-
10
come and jobs on the one hand and caring for their 
11
own and their family’s health on the other. It is in 
12
the national interest to ensure that all working peo-
13
23:26 May 27, 2021

•HR 2465 IH
ple can care for their own health and the health of 
1
their families while prospering at work. 
2
(2) Twenty-nine percent of the private sector 
3
workforce and 9 percent of the public sector work-
4
force lack paid sick time. Millions more theoretically 
5
have access to sick time, but have not been on the 
6
job long enough to use it. Millions more lack sick 
7
time they can use to care for a sick child or ill fam-
8
ily member. 
9
(3) Working people without paid sick days are 
10
more likely to go to work sick and delay or forgo 
11
needed health care. A 2016 study in the journal 
12
Health Affairs found that working adults without 
13
paid sick days are 3 times more likely to forgo med-
14
ical care for themselves, and 1.6 times more likely 
15
to forgo medical care for their family, compared to 
16
working adults with paid sick days. Lack of paid 
17
sick days is also a barrier to receiving annual health 
18
screenings and preventive care, according to a 2017 
19
study in the American Journal of Nursing. 
20
(4) Nearly 1 in 4 parents without paid sick 
21
time reports sending a sick child to school or child 
22
care because the parent has to go to work. When 
23
children go to school and child care sick, they risk 
24
their own health and that of other children, teach-
25

ers, and administrators. Research suggests that 
1
schools play a key role in transmitting contagious ill-
2
nesses like influenza. 
3
(5) A 2012 study published in the American 
4
Journal of Public Health found that a lack of work-
5
place policies like paid sick days contributed to an 
6
additional 5,000,000 cases of influenza-like illness 
7
during the H1N1 pandemic of 2009. 
8
(6) A National Bureau of Economic Research 
9
analysis examining influenza rates following the im-
10
plementation of comprehensive paid sick time laws 
11
in 7 major cities in the United States found that 
12
when workers gained access to paid sick time in 
13
those cities, the general influenza rate in the popu-
14
lation decreased by 5.5 to 6.5 percent. This analysis 
15
estimates that those laws helped prevent about 100 
16
influenza-like infections per week for every 100,000 
17
people. 
18
(7) Paid sick days contribute to more cost-effec-
19
tive use of health care resources. A 2011 study by 
20
the Institute for Women’s Policy Research found 
21
that a universal paid sick days policy would reduce 
22
preventable visits to the emergency room and result 
23
in cost savings of $1,100,000,000 per year, includ-
24
23:26 May 27, 2021

5 
•HR 2465 IH
ing $500,000,000 in savings for public health insur-
1
ance programs like Medicare and Medicaid. 
2
(8) The American Productivity Audit completed 
3
in 2003 found that lost productivity due to illness 
4
costs $226,000,000,000 ($308,000,000,000 in 2019 
5
dollars) annually, and that 71 percent of that cost 
6
stems from presenteeism—the practice of employees 
7
coming to work while ill. Studies in the Journal of 
8
Occupational and Environmental Medicine and the 
9
Journal of the American Medical Association show 
10
that presenteeism is a larger productivity drain than 
11
either absenteeism or short-term disability. 
12
(9) Working while sick also increases a worker’s 
13
probability of suffering an injury on the job. A 2012 
14
study published by the American Journal of Public 
15
Health found that workers with access to paid sick 
16
leave were 28 percent less likely than workers with-
17
out paid sick leave to suffer nonfatal occupational 
18
injuries. 
19
(10) Workers’ access to paid sick time varies 
20
dramatically by wage level, as demonstrated by the 
21
following: 
22
(A) For private sector workers— 
23
(i) for workers in the lowest quartile 
24
of earners, 55 percent lack paid sick time; 
25
23:26 May 27, 2021
H2465
6 
•HR 2465 IH
(ii) for workers in the next 2 quar-
1
tiles, 27 and 17 percent, respectively, lack 
2
paid sick time; and 
3
(iii) even for workers in the highest 
4
quartile, 10 percent lack paid sick time. 
5
(B) For public sector workers— 
6
(i) for workers in the lowest quartile 
7
of earners, 21 percent lack paid sick time; 
8
(ii) for workers in the next 2 quar-
9
tiles, 5 and 3 percent, respectively, lack 
10
paid sick time; and 
11
(iii) for workers in the highest quar-
12
tile, 5 percent lack paid sick time. 
13
(11) Workers’ access to paid sick days also var-
14
ies depending on their occupation and race. For ex-
15
ample, more than 80 percent of workers in food 
16
preparation and serving occupations lack access to 
17
paid sick days, compared to only 23 percent of work-
18
ers in management occupations. More than half of 
19
Latino workers and nearly half of Native American 
20
or Alaskan Native workers do not have access to 
21
paid sick days, compared to nearly 40 percent of 
22
White and Black workers. 
23
(12) According to the Centers for Disease Con-
24
trol and Prevention, more than 1 in 3 women and 
25
23:26 May 27, 2021
H2465
7 
•HR 2465 IH
more than 1 in 4 men in the United States report 
1
having experienced rape, physical abuse, or some 
2
form of unwanted sexual contact at some point in 
3
their lives. Women and men of color are even more 
4
likely to report being impacted by intimate partner 
5
violence. Too many people, and especially women, 
6
are forced to risk losing their jobs or critical income 
7
when they need to take time away from work to ad-
8
dress domestic-violence-related issues, such as ob-
9
taining a restraining order or finding housing, in 
10
order to avoid or prevent physical or sexual abuse. 
11
(13) Without paid sick time that can be used 
12
to address the effects of domestic violence, these vic-
13
tims are in grave danger of losing their jobs. In a 
14
2018 survey of domestic violence survivors, nearly 3⁄4 
15
(73 percent) reported that financial problems forced 
16
them to remain with their abusers longer than they 
17
wanted or to return to their abusers after having 
18
left, and more than half (53 percent) said they lost 
19
a job because of the abuse. The loss of employment 
20
can be particularly devastating for victims of domes-
21
tic violence, who often need economic security to en-
22
sure safety. 
23
(14) The Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
24
vention has estimated that intimate partner violence 
25
23:26 May 27, 2021
H2465
8 
•HR 2465 IH
costs over $700,000,000 annually due to the victims’ 
1
lost productivity in employment. 
2
(15) A 2018 study published in the American 
3
Journal of Orthopsychiatry found that workers with-
4
out paid sick leave benefits have higher levels of psy-
5
chological distress and are 1.45 times more likely to 
6
report that their distress symptoms interfere ‘‘a lot’’ 
7
with their daily life activities. 
8
(16) Efforts to assist abused employees result 
9
in positive outcomes for employers as well as em-
10
ployees because employers can retain workers who 
11
might otherwise be compelled to leave. 
12
(17) Dozens of States, cities, and localities have 
13
or will soon have paid sick time laws in place and 
14
evidence shows that those laws are working well for 
15
workers, businesses, and the economy. 
16
(18) A 2009 study by the Center for Economic 
17
and Policy Research found that, of 22 countries with 
18
comparable economies, the United States was 1 of 
19
only 3 countries that did not provide any paid time 
20
off for workers with short-term illnesses.

families by requiring employers to permit employees 
1
to earn up to 56 hours of paid sick time including 
2
paid time for family care; 
3
(2) to diminish public and private health care 
4
costs by enabling workers to seek early and routine 
5
health care for themselves and their family members; 
6
(3) to assist employees who are, or whose fam-
7
ily members are, victims of domestic violence, sexual 
8
assault, or stalking, by providing the employees with 
9
paid time away from work to allow the victims to re-
10
ceive treatment and to take the necessary steps to 
11
ensure their protection; 
12
(4) to address the historical and persistent 
13
widespread pattern of employment discrimination on 
14
the basis of gender by both private and public sector 
15
employers;
