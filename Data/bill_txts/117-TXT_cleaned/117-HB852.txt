Congress makes the following findings:

(1) The Department of Veterans Affairs reports

that between 11 and 20 percent of veterans who

served in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation 
1
Enduring Freedom have post-traumatic stress dis-
2
order (PTSD) in a given year. In addition, that fig-
3
ure amounts to about 12 percent of Gulf War vet-
4
erans and up to 30 percent of Vietnam veterans. 
5
(2) The Department of Veterans Affairs reports 
6
that among women veterans of the conflicts in Iraq 
7
and Afghanistan, almost 20 percent have been diag-
8
nosed with PTSD. 
9
(3) In the United States, it is thought that 70 
10
percent of Americans have experienced at least one 
11
traumatic event in their lifetime, and approximately 
12
20 percent of those persons have struggled or con-
13
tinue to struggle with symptoms of PTSD. 
14
(4) Studies show that PTSD has links to home-
15
lessness and substance abuse in the United States. 
16
The Department of Veterans Affairs estimates that 
17
approximately 11 percent of the homeless population 
18
are veterans and the Substance Abuse and Mental 
19
Health Services Administration estimates that about 
20
7 percent of veterans have a substance abuse dis-
21
order. 
22
(5) Our ally Israel, under constant attack from 
23
terrorist groups, experiences similar issues with 
24
Israeli veterans facing PTSD symptoms. Tel Aviv

University’s National Center for Traumatic Stress 
1
and Resilience found that 5 to 8 percent of combat 
2
soldiers experience some form of PTSD, and during 
3
wartime, that figure rises to 15 to 20 percent. 
4
(6) Current treatment options in the United 
5
States focus on cognitive therapy, exposure therapy, 
6
or eye movement desensitization and reprocessing, 
7
but the United States must continue to look for 
8
more effective treatments. Several leading Israeli 
9
hospitals, academic institutions, and nonprofits dedi-
10
cate research and services to treating PTSD.
