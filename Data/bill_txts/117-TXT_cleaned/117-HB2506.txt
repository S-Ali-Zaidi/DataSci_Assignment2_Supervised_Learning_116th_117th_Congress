A BILL 
To counter Saudi Arabia’s possible pursuit of weapons of 
mass destruction, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Stopping Activities Un-
4
derpinning Development In Weapons of Mass Destruction 
5
Act’’ or the ‘‘SAUDI WMD Act’’. 
6
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
7
Congress makes the following findings: 
8
(1) The People’s Republic of China (in this Act 
9
referred to as ‘‘China’’), became a full-participant of 
10
02:29 May 28, 2021
H2506

•HR 2506 IH
the Nuclear Suppliers Group in 2004, committing it 
1
to apply a strong presumption of denial in exporting 
2
nuclear-related items that a foreign country could 
3
divert to a nuclear weapons program. 
4
(2) China also committed to the United States, 
5
in November 2000, to abide by the foundational 
6
principles of the 1987 Missile Technology Control 
7
Regime (MTCR) to not ‘‘assist, in any way, any 
8
country in the development of ballistic missiles that 
9
can be used to deliver nuclear weapons (i.e., missiles 
10
capable of delivering a payload of at least 500 kilo-
11
grams to a distance of at least 300 kilometers)’’. 
12
(3) In the 1980s, China secretly sold the King-
13
dom of Saudi Arabia (in this Act referred to as 
14
‘‘Saudi Arabia’’) conventionally armed DF–3A bal-
15
listic missiles, and in 2007, reportedly sold Saudi 
16
Arabia dual-use capable DF–21 medium-range bal-
17
listic missiles of a 300 kilometer, 500-kilogram 
18
range and payload threshold which should have trig-
19
gered a denial of sale under the MTCR. 
20
(4) The 2020 Department of State Report on 
21
the Adherence to and Compliance with Arms Con-
22
trol, Nonproliferation, and Disarmament Agree-
23
ments and Commitments found that China ‘‘contin-
24
ued to supply MTCR-controlled goods to missile pro-

•HR 2506 IH
grams of proliferation concern in 2019’’ and that 
1
the United States imposed sanctions on nine Chinese 
2
entities for covered missile transfers to Iran. 
3
(5) A June 5, 2019, press report indicated that 
4
China allegedly provided assistance to Saudi Arabia 
5
in the development of a ballistic missile facility, 
6
which if confirmed, would violate the purpose of the 
7
MTCR and run contrary to the longstanding United 
8
States policy priority to prevent weapons of mass de-
9
struction proliferation in the Middle East. 
10
(6) The Arms Export and Control Act of 1976 
11
(Public Law 93–329) requires the President to sanc-
12
tion any foreign person or government who know-
13
ingly ‘‘exports, transfers, or otherwise engages in the 
14
trade of any MTCR equipment or technology’’ to a 
15
country that does not adhere to the MTCR. 
16
(7) China concluded two nuclear cooperation 
17
agreements with Saudi Arabia in 2012 and 2017, re-
18
spectively, which may facilitate China’s bid to build 
19
two reactors in Saudi Arabia to generate 2.9 
20
Gigawatt-electric (GWe) of electricity. 
21
(8) On August 4, 2020, a press report revealed 
22
the alleged existence of a previously undisclosed ura-
23
nium yellowcake extraction facility in Saudi Arabia 
24
allegedly constructed with the assistance of China, 
25
02:29 May 28, 2021
H2506
4 
•HR 2506 IH
which if confirmed, would indicate significant 
1
progress by Saudi Arabia in developing the early 
2
stages of the nuclear fuel cycle that precede uranium 
3
enrichment. 
4
(9) Saudi Arabia’s outdated Small Quantities 
5
Protocol and its lack of an in force Additional Pro-
6
tocol to its International Atomic Energy Agency 
7
(IAEA) Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement se-
8
verely curtails IAEA inspections, which has led the 
9
Agency to call upon Saudi Arabia to either rescind 
10
or update its Small Quantities Protocol. 
11
(10) On January 19, 2021, in response to a 
12
question about Saudi Arabia’s reported ballistic mis-
13
sile cooperation with China, Secretary of State-to-be 
14
Antony J. Blinken stated that ‘‘we want to make 
15
sure that to the best of our ability all of our part-
16
ners and allies are living up to their obligations 
17
under various nonproliferation and arms control 
18
agreements and, certainly, in the case of Saudi Ara-
19
bia that is something we will want to look at.’’. 
20
(11) On March 15, 2018, the Crown Prince of 
21
Saudi Arabia, Mohammad bin-Salman, stated that 
22
‘‘if Iran developed a nuclear bomb, we would follow 
23
suit as soon as possible,’’ raising questions about 
24
whether a Saudi Arabian nuclear program would re-

•HR 2506 IH
main exclusively peaceful, particularly in the absence 
1
of robust international IAEA safeguards. 
2
(12) An August 9, 2019, study by the United 
3
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
4
found that the Saudi Arabia-led military coalition 
5
airstrikes in Yemen and its restrictions on the flow 
6
of humanitarian assistance to the country, both of 
7
which have disproportionately impacted civilians, 
8
may be violations of international humanitarian law.
