A BILL 
To amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to codify 
value-based purchasing arrangements under the Medicaid 
program and reforms related to price reporting under 
such arrangements, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Medicaid VBPs for 
4
Patients Act’’ or the ‘‘MVP Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
The Congress finds the following:

•HR 7389 IH
(1) Value-based payment (VBP) arrangements 
1
are a critical component of a modernized reimburse-
2
ment system. By codifying elements of the recently 
3
finalized ‘‘multiple best price’’ policies of the Centers 
4
for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Congress is en-
5
shrining a sustainable and flexible payment ap-
6
proach for innovative treatments and cures. 
7
(2) Many of these treatments, including gene 
8
therapies, are different from traditional pharma-
9
ceutical and biologic products in that they can offer 
10
long-lasting—sometimes lifelong—benefits for pa-
11
tients and long-term value for the health care system 
12
alike. 
13
(3) There are hundreds of innovative, curative, 
14
and life-changing treatments currently in develop-
15
ment in the United States. However, the current re-
16
imbursement structure was not designed with these 
17
therapies in mind, and allowing for innovative pay-
18
ment arrangements will spur greater development 
19
and access to future cures and treatments. 
20
(4) Medicaid is currently losing out on innova-
21
tive ways to ensure patients have access to these 
22
treatments, while private payors continue to see the 
23
value provided through flexible payment arrange-
24
ments. 
25

•HR 7389 IH
(5) VBP arrangements include the ability to 
1
pay based on evidence-based outcomes and, over 
2
time, spreading the risk across all entities involved 
3
in the contract and ensuring that these often costly 
4
treatments are accessible. 
5
(6) Evidence-based outcomes can demonstrate 
6
decreased cost to the health system and to patients, 
7
including reduced hospitalizations and lower utiliza-
8
tion of other health care expenditures, including lab 
9
work, other medications, and office visits. 
10
(7) By allowing VBPs in Medicaid, the health 
11
care system will continue to move towards quality 
12
over quantity, holding manufacturers and providers 
13
accountable for the best treatment for every patient.
