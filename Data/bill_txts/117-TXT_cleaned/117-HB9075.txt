SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress makes the following findings: 
2
(1) Article 3 of the Universal Declaration of 
3
Human Rights guarantees the right to life, liberty, 
4
and security of person. Article 9 of such Declaration 
5
prohibits arbitrary arrests or detentions and Article 
6
18 of such Declaration guarantees the right to free-
7
dom of thought, conscience, and religion. 
8
(2) As a member state of the United Nations 
9
and other international institutions, the Islamic Re-
10
public of Iran is bound by international commit-
11
ments concerning human rights and the rule of law. 
12
Nevertheless, the Islamic Republic of Iran has sys-
13
tematically and consistently curtailed the ability of 
14
Iranian citizens to exercise fundamental freedoms 
15
without fear of retribution. 
16
(3) On September 13, 2022, 22-year-old Masha 
17
Amini was detained by the Islamic Republic of 
18
Iran’s Morality Police, for allegedly having visible 
19
hair under her headscarf. 
20
(4) On September 19, 2022, in response to her 
21
death, protesters took to the streets across Iran. The 
22
Iranian Government sought to put down these pro-
23
tests with violence, which has resulted in the deaths 
24
of at least 48 people, including 20-year-old Hadis 
25
Najafi, who was shot multiple times by security

forces according to eyewitnesses, and the arrests of 
1
hundreds more. 
2
(5) On October 6, 2021, the United Nations 
3
Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights 
4
released a statement expressing grave concern re-
5
garding the consistent practice of the Islamic Repub-
6
lic of Iran to deny medical treatment to detainees, 
7
including political prisoners. Denials of medical 
8
treatment worsened during the year 2021 due to the 
9
spread of COVID–19 throughout prisons. The state-
10
ment also called for the unconditional release of 
11
human rights defenders, attorneys, political pris-
12
oners, peaceful protesters, and all other persons de-
13
prived of liberty for expressing views or otherwise 
14
exercising rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
15
(6) On December 16, 2021, the General Assem-
16
bly of the United Nations adopted Resolution 76/ 
17
178, criticizing the practices of the Islamic Republic 
18
of Iran and calling on the Islamic Republic of Iran 
19
to implement significant reforms, including— 
20
(A) ensuring that no person is subject to 
21
torture or other cruel, inhuman, or degrading 
22
treatment; 
23
(B) ceasing the widespread and systematic 
24
use of arbitrary arrests and detentions; 
25

•HR 9075 IH
(C) releasing persons detained for exer-
1
cising the human rights and fundamental free-
2
doms; and 
3
(D) improving the conditions of prisons. 
4
(7) According to the 2021 Country Reports on 
5
Human Rights Practices issued by the Department 
6
of State, the Islamic Republic of Iran took few steps 
7
during the year 2021 to identify, investigate, pros-
8
ecute, or punish persons at all levels of the Iranian 
9
Government and the Iranian security forces. Such 
10
reports include credible accounts that the Islamic 
11
Republic of Iran or agents of the Islamic Republic 
12
of Iran, have been implicated in— 
13
(A) unlawful or arbitrary killings; 
14
(B) forced disappearances; 
15
(C) torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrad-
16
ing treatment; 
17
(D) arbitrary arrest or detention; 
18
(E) harsh or life-threatening prison condi-
19
tions; 
20
(F) lack of judiciary independence, particu-
21
larly regarding the revolutionary courts; 
22
(G) severe restrictions on free expression 
23
and media, including censorship, criminalization 
24
of libel and slander, and violence, threats of vio-
25

lence, unjustified arrests, and prosecutions 
1
against journalists; and 
2
(H) serious restrictions on and harassment 
3
of domestic or international human rights orga-
4
nizations. 
5
(8) The 2021 Country Reports on Human 
6
Rights Practices further reported that political pris-
7
oners in the Islamic Republic of Iran were at greater 
8
risk of torture and abuse in detention and were 
9
often mixed with the general prison population. 
10
Former prisoners in the Islamic Republic of Iran re-
11
ported that government authorities often threatened 
12
political prisoners with transfer to criminal wards, 
13
where attacks by fellow prisoners were more likely. 
14
Human rights activists and international media or-
15
ganizations reported cases of political prisoners con-
16
fined with persons accused of and convicted of vio-
17
lent crime. The Islamic Republic of Iran also often 
18
exiled political prisoners to prisons in remote prov-
19
inces far from the families of such prisoners as a 
20
means of reprisal, denied such prisoners a right to 
21
correspondence and access to legal counsel, and held 
22
such prisoners in solitary confinement for long peri-
23
ods.

(9) According to the organization Iran Human 
1
Rights, in October of 2021, political prisoners 
2
Shapour Ehsanirad, Pouya Ghobadi, Esmail Gerami, 
3
Akbar Bagheri, and Akbar Shirazi were seriously in-
4
jured after being attacked by prisoners accused of or 
5
convicted of violent crime. 
6
(10) According to the United Nations Special 
7
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the 
8
Islamic Republic of Iran, the Ministry of Intelligence 
9
of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Intelligence 
10
Organization of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard 
11
Corps control secret detention centers with ‘‘deplor-
12
able’’ conditions. Such centers often house, for ex-
13
tended pretrial detentions, political prisoners and 
14
other persons arbitrarily arrested on national secu-
15
rity charges. For example, Ali Younesi and 
16
Amirhossein Moradi have been arbitrarily detained 
17
in section 209 of Evin Prison since such persons 
18
were arrested in April of 2020. Evin Prison, a noto-
19
rious facility located in Tehran, is under the control 
20
of the Ministry of Intelligence of the Islamic Repub-
21
lic of Iran and is a primary prison for political de-
22
tainees. 
23
(11) Attorneys who defend political prisoners 
24
detained by the Islamic Republic of Iran are regu-
25
17:51 Oct 20, 2022

•HR 9075 IH
larly arrested, detained, and subjected to excessive 
1
punishments for engaging in regular professional ac-
2
tivities. The Islamic Republic of Iran also continues 
3
to imprison attorneys and others affiliated with the 
4
advocacy group Defenders of Human Rights Center. 
5
According to the Center for Human Rights in Iran, 
6
not less than 5 human rights attorneys—Soheila 
7
Hejab, Payam Derafshan, Mohammad Nafari, 
8
Amirsalar Davoudi, and Nasrin Sotoudeh—were in 
9
prison during the year 2021 for performing human 
10
rights work. 
11
(12) With limited options for recourse, political 
12
prisoners regularly participate in hunger strikes to 
13
raise awareness about prison conditions and the 
14
plight of political prisoners, who are often denied 
15
medical treatment. In January of 2022, according to 
16
reporting by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, 6 
17
prisoners in Evin Prison went on a hunger strike 
18
following the death of jailed Iranian poet and 
19
filmmaker Baktash Abtin. At least 3 other prisoners 
20
at the Gharchak Women’s Prison and the Greater 
21
Tehran Central Penitentiary joined the hunger 
22
strike. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported 
23
that dozens of prisoners are believed to have died in 
24
the prisons of the Islamic Republic of Iran due to 
25
17:51 Oct 20, 2022

•HR 9075 IH
mistreatment, including beatings, torture, and a lack 
1
of proper medical care. 
2
(13) In August of 2021, following the release of 
3
footage of mistreatment and torture at Evin Prison, 
4
the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and 
5
Labor of the Department of State issued a state-
6
ment stating that the ‘‘recently leaked footage of 
7
[the] notorious Evin Prison confirms what we have 
8
long known: torture is systemic in Iranian prisons. 
9
We call on the Islamic Republic of Iran to release 
10
all political prisoners and to treat all prisoners with 
11
dignity’’. 
12
(14) According to the organization United for 
13
Iran, more than 556 prisoners of conscience, includ-
14
ing persons jailed for religious beliefs, were held in 
15
200 or more prisons in the Islamic Republic of Iran 
16
as of May of 2022.

SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
18
It is the policy of the United States that— 
19
(1) the Islamic Republic of Iran should allow 
20
the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the situa-
21

22
unimpeded access to facilitate the full implementa-
23
tion of the mandate of the United Nations Special
