CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 
Finding that the January 6, 2021, attack on the United 
States Capitol Complex and the corresponding attempt 
to bypass constitutional order and obstruct through cor-
rupt means the counting of certified electoral votes of 
the several States under section 15 of title 3, United 
States Code, on January 6, 2021, with intent to displace 
the lawfully elected President of the United States or

thwart the will of the majority of electors, constitute 
an insurrection against the United States, and that any 
person who participated in the attack, or conspired or 
attempted to bypass constitutional order and obstruct 
through corrupt means the counting of certified electoral 
votes of the several States under section 15 of title 
3, United States Code, on January 6, 2021, with intent 
to displace the lawfully elected President of the United 
States or thwart the will of the majority of electors, 
is deemed to have engaged in an insurrection in violation 
of section 3 of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution. 
Whereas section 3 of the 14th Amendment to the Constitu-
tion states ‘‘No Person shall be a Senator or Representa-
tive in Congress, or elector of President and Vice-Presi-
dent, or hold any office, civil or military, under the 
United States, or under any State, who, having pre-
viously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as 
an officer of the United States, or as a member of any 
State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of 
any State, to support the Constitution of the United 
States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion 
against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies 
thereof. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of 
each House, remove such disability.’’; 
Whereas the 14th Amendment, ratified following the Civil 
War, included section 3, which originally was intended to 
address insurrection against the United States by, among 
other things, preventing those who joined the Confed-
eracy from holding future State or Federal office; 
Whereas the language of section 3 of the 14th Amendment, 
and subsequent congressional actions and judicial deci-
sions, all uniformly establish that disqualification from

•HCON 93 IH 
holding future Federal or State office is applicable to cov-
ered persons who participate in any and all future rebel-
lions or insurrections, and not merely covered persons 
who joined the Confederacy; 
Whereas invoking section 3 of the 14th Amendment does not 
impose criminal punishment, but merely acts to ensure 
that those entrusted with public office have not acted 
dangerously towards the Union in the past by previously 
participating in an insurrection against the United 
States, as was stated by Senator Waitman T. Willey from 
West Virginia during the debate on ratifying the 14th 
Amendment, the ban on office holding is not ‘‘penal in 
its character, it is precautionary’’; 
Whereas Congress has broad authority under article I, sec-
tion 8 of the Constitution to protect the functions of the 
government and has authority to pass appropriate resolu-
tions to enforce section 3 of the 14th Amendment, fol-
lowing the decisive precedent established by Congress in 
1869 when it invoked section 3 through a Joint Resolu-
tion in 1869 ordering the removal of civil officeholders 
who had not received amnesty from Congress; 
Whereas Congress previously passed the Ku Klux Klan Act 
of 1871 which, among other things, enforced section 3 of 
the 14th Amendment by giving priority to civil actions 
seeking to remove ineligible officials and imposing crimi-
nal penalties for knowing violations of this constitutional 
provision; and 
Whereas the framers of the 14th Amendment intended that 
‘‘office, civil or military, under the United States’’ include 
the Office of the President and Vice President, and the 
term ‘‘officer of the United States’’ include the President 
and Vice President: Now, therefore, be it
