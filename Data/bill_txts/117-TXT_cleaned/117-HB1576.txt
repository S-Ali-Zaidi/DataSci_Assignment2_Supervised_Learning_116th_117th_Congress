SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress makes the following findings: 
2
(1) In the last 50 years, more individuals in the 
3
United States have died from gunshots than in all 
4
wars in which the United States was a combatant, 
5
combined. 
6
(2) The rate of gun violence deaths in the 
7
United States is more than double that of other 
8
high-income nations. 
9
(3) Guns accounted for 74 percent of homicides 
10
and 51 percent of suicides in 2016, totaling over 
11
37,000 deaths in the United States. 
12
(4) Gun violence disproportionately affects ra-
13
cial minorities, with African Americans comprising 
14
nearly 60 percent of homicide victims and 22 per-
15
cent of unintentional injury deaths in 2016. 
16
(5) Provisions in appropriations Acts dating 
17
back to 1996 have had a chilling effect on Federal 
18
funding for research on gun violence across the Fed-
19
eral Government and, as a result, research on gun 
20
violence is significantly underfunded relative to other 
21
leading causes of death. 
22
(6) Research examining the nature, causes, con-
23
sequences, and prevention of gun-related violence, 
24
suicide, and unintentional injury and death does not 
25

•HR 1576 IH
constitute advocacy in support of, or opposition to, 
1
gun control policies or regulations. 
2
(7) More research and high-quality data relat-
3
ing to gun violence are needed to inform the develop-
4
ment of effective strategies to reduce the incidence 
5
of gun-related injury and death.
