(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The test center within National Tele-
3
communications and Information Administration (in 
4
this subsection referred to as the ‘‘NTIA’’) rep-
5
resents executive branch agencies on spectrum issues 
6
before the Federal Communications Commission. 
7
(2) Understanding radio frequency propagation 
8
characteristics and modeling is a critical component 
9
of making spectrum decisions. 
10
(3) Federal agencies rely on expert engineering 
11
studies, simulations, and analyses to make deter-
12
minations about system relocations to make spec-
13
trum available for commercial use as well as identify 
14
spectrum sharing opportunities through the NTIA. 
15
(4) Clearing of Federal spectrum, when fea-
16
sible, is the priority action to make Federal spec-
17
trum available for commercial uses. 
18
(5) Sharing of Federal spectrum between Fed-
19
eral entities and commercial entities provides access 
20
to Federal spectrum for commercial uses in cir-
21
cumstances where clearing is not possible. 
22
(6) The test center within NTIA, is the Govern-
23
ment’s premier expert laboratory for spectrum re-
24
search activities, spectrum sharing innovation and 
25
testing, spectrum interference studies, and all activi-

ties related to advancing next generation wireless 
1
technologies. 
2
(7) The test center within NTIA is critical for 
3
undertaking engineering studies and analyses, iden-
4
tifying clearing or sharing opportunities, and facili-
5
tating policy decisions to maximize the efficient use 
6
of spectrum resources.

(b) OPERATION OF TEST CENTER.—Part A of the 
8
National Telecommunications and Information Adminis-
9
tration Organization Act (47 U.S.C. 901 et seq.) is
