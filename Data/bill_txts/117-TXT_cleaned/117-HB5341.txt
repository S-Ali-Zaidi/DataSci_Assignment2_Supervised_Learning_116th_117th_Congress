SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Between 2016 and 2020, on average, 89 
8
percent of wildfires in the United States have been 
9
human-caused.

(2) Human-caused fires tend to occur in or 
1
near the wildland-urban interface (as defined in sec-
2
tion 101 of the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 
3
2003 (16 U.S.C. 6511)), where there is a greater 
4
risk to people and communities and a higher cost to 
5
suppress fires. 
6
(3) The wildland-urban interface is the fastest- 
7
growing land use type in the United States, posing 
8
challenges for fire management and suppression. 
9
(4) Over the last 10 years, an annual average 
10
of 62,805 wildfires have impacted 7,516,855 acres. 
11
In 2020, 58,950 wildfires impacted 10,122,336 
12
acres nationwide. Approximately 70 percent of this 
13
acreage impacted Federal land, of which 48 percent 
14
(or 4,800,000 acres) was on National Forest System 
15
land. 
16
(5) Additionally, visitation at National Forests 
17
has increased, while staffing has declined. Notably, 
18
in fiscal year 2020, the Forest Service estimated 
19
168.2 million National Forest recreation visits, an 
20
increase of over 18.2 million recreation visits from 
21
2019, which amounts to a 12.1 percent increase. 
22
(6) The Forest Service continues to suffer from 
23
chronic staffing shortages, with several National 
24
Forests and Grasslands struggling to maintain their
