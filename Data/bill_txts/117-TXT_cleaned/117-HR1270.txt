RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the importance of independent living for individ-
uals with disabilities made possible by the Americans 
with Disabilities Act of 1990 and calling for further 
action to strengthen home and community living for indi-
viduals with disabilities. 
Whereas, in enacting the Americans with Disabilities Act of 
1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.), Congress recognized 
that ‘‘historically, society has tended to isolate and seg-
regate individuals with disabilities, and, despite some im-
provements, such forms of discrimination against individ-

uals with disabilities continue to be a serious and perva-
sive social problem’’; 
Whereas the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 recog-
nizes the rights of individuals with disabilities to fully 
participate in their communities through independent liv-
ing, equality of opportunity, and economic self-suffi-
ciency; 
Whereas 32 years after the date of the enactment of the 
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and 23 years 
after the date of the decision of the Supreme Court of 
the United States in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 
(1999), many individuals with disabilities continue to live 
in segregated institutional settings because of a lack of 
support services; 
Whereas the continuation of segregated institutional settings 
has hindered the inclusion of individuals with disabilities 
in communities, schools, and workplaces, undermining 
the promise of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 
1990; 
Whereas individuals with disabilities living in institutional 
and long-term care settings have endured dispropor-
tionate rates of infection and death during the COVID– 
19 pandemic; 
Whereas individuals of color with disabilities have been dis-
parately affected by the COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas individuals of color with disabilities experience dis-
proportionately greater barriers to high quality and ac-
cessible healthcare, education, and employment opportu-
nities, infringing on their right to fully participate in 
their communities under the Americans with Disabilities 
Act of 1990; and
