The Congress finds that— 
7
(1) according to the Centers for Disease Con-
8
trol and Prevention (CDC), on average between 
9

•HR 7165 IH
2011 and 2016, approximately 590,000 or 2.5 per-
1
cent of children under the age of 6 in the United 
2
States had elevated blood lead levels above the CDC 
3
reference value of 3.5 micrograms per deciliter (μg/ 
4
dL); 
5
(2) there is no safe blood lead level in children; 
6
(3) according to the CDC, the effects of lead 
7
poisoning are immediate and permanent—childhood 
8
exposure to lead, even at very low levels, can have 
9
lifelong consequences, including decreased IQ and 
10
cognitive function, developmental delays, and behav-
11
ioral problems; 
12
(4) higher exposures to lead at a young age can 
13
cause seizures, coma, and even death; 
14
(5) under current law, children whose families 
15
participate in the Housing Choice Voucher Program 
16
must have been identified as having an elevated 
17
blood lead exceeding 3.5 micrograms per deciliter, as 
18
established by the CDC, or exhibit symptoms of lead 
19
poisoning before a lead hazard risk assessment oc-
20
curs; and 
21
(6) while some localities have required property 
22
owners to conduct risk assessments and abate lead 
23
when a child under the age of 6 will reside in a 
24
dwelling unit, the Massachusetts Fair Housing Cen-

ter recently sued the Massachusetts Department of 
1
Public Health for instituting such a policy that the 
2
Fair Housing Center argues led to augmented in-
3
stances of housing discrimination on the basis of fa-
4
milial status, as defined by section 802 of the Fair 
5
Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3602(k)), making housing 
6
opportunities less available for families with children
