A BILL 
To amend the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to require 
disclosures related to the Paris Climate Agreement, and 
for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Paris Climate Agree-
4
ment Disclosure Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) 197 parties, including the United States, 
8
are parties to the United Nations Framework Con-
9
vention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the prin-

cipal framework to stabilize greenhouse gas con-
1
centrations at a level that would prevent dangerous 
2
human-induced interference with the climate system. 
3
(2) On December 12, 2015, parties of the 
4
UNFCCC adopted the Paris Agreement, the first 
5
comprehensive agreement among all nations to keep 
6
global warming below 2 degrees Celsius. 
7
(3) The Paris Agreement aims to strengthen 
8
the global response to the threat of climate change 
9
by holding the increase in the global average tem-
10
perature to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre- 
11
industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the 
12
temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius above 
13
pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would sig-
14
nificantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate 
15
change. 
16
(4) The ‘‘Special Report on Global Warming of 
17
1.5 °C’’ by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
18
Change found that at 1.5 degrees Celsius warming, 
19
climate-related risks to human health, livelihoods, 
20
food security, human security, water supply, and 
21
economic growth will all increase, and will increase 
22
even more at 2 degrees Celsius warming. 
23
(5) In 2017, the World Economic Forum issued 
24
the Compact for Responsive and Responsible Lead-

ership with 140 CEOs pledging to align their cor-
1
porate values and strategies with the United Na-
2
tion’s Sustainable Development Goals. 
3
(6) In September 2020, the World Economic 
4
Forum and its International Business Council re-
5
leased Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics—a set of en-
6
vironmental, social and governance metrics and dis-
7
closures which measure the long-term enterprise 
8
value creation for all stakeholders. 
9
(7) The September 2020 World Economic 
10
Forum report recognizes that there is an emerging 
11
consensus among companies that long-term value is 
12
most effectively created by serving the interests of 
13
all stakeholders. 
14
(8) On January 26, 2021, 61 CEOs of some of 
15
the world’s largest companies publicly endorsed the 
16
Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics. 
17
(9) One of the core metrics and disclosures de-
18
fined in the Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics is for 
19
companies to disclose whether they have set, or have 
20
committed to set, greenhouse gas emissions targets 
21
that are in line with the goals of the Paris Agree-
22
ment.
