RESOLUTION 
Urging United States policy toward Guatemala to support 
the rule of law and address challenges of kleptocracy, 
organized crime, private and public sector corruption, 
illicit campaign financing, criminalization of and attacks 
on justice operators, journalists, and human rights de-
fenders, and restrictions resulting in the closure of civic 
space. 
Whereas in the June 2021 United States Strategy on Coun-
tering Corruption, President Joe Biden stated that ‘‘Cor-
ruption threatens United States national security, eco-

nomic equity, global anti-poverty and development efforts, 
and democracy itself’’; 
Whereas, according to the Department of State report for 
2021 on Human Rights Conditions in Guatemala, cor-
ruption and impunity continue to be serious problems in 
Guatemala, asserting that ‘‘prominent anticorruption 
prosecutors were fired or removed from significant cases, 
and corrupt actors threatened independent judges by fil-
ing complaints based on spurious charges to strip them 
of immunity to prosecution’’; 
Whereas the Department of State included Guatemalan At-
torney General Maria Consuelo Porras on the Undemo-
cratic and Corrupt Actors list released September 20, 
2021, due to her ‘‘involvement in significant corruption’’ 
and pattern of obstructing justice, including by report-
edly ‘‘ordering prosecutors in Guatemala’s Public Min-
istry to ignore cases based on political considerations and 
firing prosecutors who investigate cases involving acts of 
corruption’’; 
Whereas, on May 16, 2022, after President Alejandro 
Giammattei reappointed Maria Consuelo Porras as Attor-
ney General, the United States deemed her ineligible for 
entry into the United States ‘‘due to her involvement in 
significant corruption’’; 
Whereas, as of June 2022, at least 24 justice operators in-
volved in fighting corruption, including public prosecu-
tors, judges, a magistrate from the Constitutional Court, 
and two former attorneys general had been forced into 
exile;

•HRES 1481 IH 
Whereas, as of May 2022, at least 6 anticorruption prosecu-
tors have been detained by Guatemalan authorities based 
on spurious or frivolous charges; 
Whereas, according to the Inter-American Commission on 
Human Rights 2021 Annual Report on Guatemala, the 
weakening of human rights institutions and setbacks to 
the fight against corruption and impunity have a dis-
proportionate impact on women, children, indigenous peo-
ples, and other historically marginalized populations; 
Whereas the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights reported that ‘‘throughout 2021, attacks and judi-
cial persecution against justice operators for their legiti-
mate work continued’’ in a pattern that ‘‘undermines the 
rule of law and judicial independence’’; 
Whereas, on June 21, 2021, a law entered into force in Gua-
temala which imposes onerous administrative require-
ments for nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), mak-
ing it difficult or impossible for them to operate and giv-
ing the government the ability to close NGOs at will; 
Whereas the excessive and unjustified use of states of excep-
tion has created a situation in which numerous 
warrantless arrests are conducted, often targeting indige-
nous community leaders defending their rights to land; 
Whereas Guatemalan human rights group La Unidad de 
Proteccio´n a Defensoras y Defensores de Derechos 
Humanos—Guatemala (UDEFEGUA) documented over 
589 acts of violence and aggression against human rights 
defenders, justice operators, and journalists from Janu-
ary to June 2022;

Whereas, in 2021, at least 179 attacks were reported against 
indigenous and campesino leaders who defend land, terri-
tory, and the environment; and 
Whereas since January 1, 2021, after receiving threats that 
led them to fear for their lives, 6 journalists have fled 
into exile, and on July 29, 2022, award-winning jour-
nalist Jose´ Rube´n Zamora, founder and president of the 
newspaper El Perio´dico, was arrested at his home and re-
mains detained: Now, therefore, be it
