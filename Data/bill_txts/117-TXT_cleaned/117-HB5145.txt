A BILL 
To authorize new grants for research into riparian forest 
genetics and climate adaptation. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. FINDINGS. 
3
Congress finds that— 
4
(1) because most native plant species are ge-
5
netically adapted to their local environment, climate 
6
change and invasive species result in plants no 
7
longer being locally adapted; 
8
(2) to promote restoration success, a network of 
9
integrated field trials (also known as provenance

trials or common gardens) is crucial to determine 
1
which populations of dominant plants can survive 
2
current and projected future conditions, which in 
3
turn will enable the development of precision models 
4
to forecast climate change impacts on key native ri-
5
parian forest species and the species that depend 
6
upon them for their survival; and 
7
(3) riparian systems are integral to and essen-
8
tial to wetland health and preservation, research 
9
into, and efforts to restore and protect the health of 
10
riparian ecosystems is essential.

SEC. 2. RESEARCH GRANTS FOR PROJECTS RELATED TO 
12
RIPARIAN FOREST GENETICS AND CLIMATE 
13
ADAPTATION. 
14
The Secretary of the Interior shall establish a grant 
15
program for eligible entities to carry out projects that in-
16
volve long-term research into plant genetics and genomics 
17
to make riparian forests and streams more resilient to cli-
18
mate change and invasive species and to provide critical 
19
habitat for birds, native fish, endangered species and other 
20
animals and plants that are suffering from lost, degraded, 
21
or threatened habitat. The Secretary shall determine enti-
22
ties eligible to receive such grants, projects eligible for 
23
such grants, application and approval procedures for such 
24
grants, and any limitations on the amount and uses of 
25

such grants, and any other terms and conditions the Sec-
1
retary determines appropriate. 
2
SEC. 3. DEFINITION OF RIPARIAN FOREST. 
3
As used in this Act, the term ‘‘riparian forest’’ means 
4
any riparian area and includes all plant, animal, insect, 
5
and microbial communities in such areas. 
6
SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. 
7
There is authorized to be appropriated to the Sec-
8
retary of the Interior $13,000,000 for each of fiscals years 
9
2022 through 2031 to carry out the grant program estab-
10
