Homeland Security, for high crimes and misdemeanors. 
Resolved, That Alejandro Nicholas Mayorkas, Sec-
1
retary of Homeland Security, is impeached for high crimes 
2
and misdemeanors and that the following articles of im-
3
peachment be exhibited to the United States Senate: 
4
Articles of impeachment exhibited by the House of 
5
Representatives of the United States of America in the 
6
name of itself and of the people of the United States of 
7

8
of Homeland Security, in maintenance and support of its

impeachment against him for high crimes and mis-

demeanors.

ARTICLE I 
3
Alejandro Nicholas Mayorkas, in his conduct while 
4
Secretary of Homeland Security, engaged in a pattern of 
5
conduct that is incompatible with his duties as an Officer 
6
of the United States, as follows: 
7
Secretary Mayorkas took an oath to defend and se-
8
cure our country and uphold the Constitution when he was 
9
sworn in as Secretary of Homeland Security on February 
10
2, 2021. Article II of the U.S. Constitution tasks the Ex-
11
ecutive branch—which today includes the Secretary of 
12
Homeland Security—with ensuring the laws passed by 
13
Congress and signed into law by the President are faith-
14
fully executed. 
15
Secretary Mayorkas has failed to faithfully uphold his 
16
oath and has instead presided over a reckless abandon-
17
ment of border security and immigration enforcement, at 
18
the expense of the Constitution and the security of the 
19
United States. Secretary Mayorkas has violated, and con-
20
tinues to violate, this requirement by failing to maintain 
21
operational control of the border and releasing hundreds 
22
of thousands of illegal aliens into the interior of the United 
23
States. 
24
Secretary Mayorkas has willfully refused to maintain 
25
operational control of the border as required by the Secure

Fence Act of 2006. His actions have directly led to an 
1
increase in illegal aliens and illegal narcotics, including 
2
deadly fentanyl, entering the United States. 
3
The Secure Fence Act of 2006 (Public Law 109–367) 
4
requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to take all 
5
actions ‘‘necessary and appropriate to achieve and main-
6
tain operational control over the entire international land 
7
and maritime borders of the United States[.]’’. The Act 
8
defines ‘‘operational control’’ as the ‘‘prevention of all un-
9
lawful entries into the United States, including entries by 
10
terrorists, other unlawful aliens, instruments of terrorism, 
11
narcotics, and other contraband.’’. 
12
During the Trump Administration, the Department 
13
of Homeland Security constructed approximately 450 
14
miles of new and replacement border wall system; an addi-
15
tional 285 miles were either under construction or in the 
16
pre-construction phase at the end of the Trump Adminis-
17
tration in January 2021. Under Secretary Mayorkas’s di-
18
rection, the Department of Homeland Security terminated 
19
contracts for additional border wall construction despite 
20
funds being appropriated by Congress for this purpose. 
21
His decision has left key portions of the southern border 
22
unsecure and cost American taxpayers billions of dollars. 
23
Secretary Mayorkas has willfully violated the Immi-
24
gration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.) by

releasing illegal aliens into the interior of the United 
1
States despite the plain language of the Act, which re-
2
quires the Secretary of Homeland Security to detain inad-
3
missible aliens arriving into the United States or aliens 
4
who are present in the United States without inspection 
5
while such aliens are processed under expedited removal 
6
or placed in removal proceedings. The Secretary of Home-
7
land Security does not have the option of simply releasing 
8
those aliens into the interior of the United States. 
9
Secretary Mayorkas reinstituted the catch and re-
10
lease policies of the Obama administration and has even 
11
released inadmissible aliens into the interior of the United 
12
States without issuing the aliens notices to appear for im-
13
migration proceedings. He is relying on the aliens to re-
14
port on their own volition to U.S. Immigration and Cus-
15
toms Enforcement offices to be placed into removal pro-
16
ceedings, a practice that violates the law and defies logic 
17
and common sense. Department of Homeland Security 
18
data show that over 80 percent of these released illegal 
19
aliens are failing to report to a U.S. Immigration and Cus-
20
toms Enforcement field office. 
21
On May 13, 2021, Secretary Mayorkas admitted dur-
22
ing testimony before the Senate Committee on Homeland 
23
Security and Governmental Affairs that U.S. Customs and 
24
Border Protection was releasing inadmissible aliens, whom

•HRES 582 IH 
the Department of Homeland Security is required to de-
1
tain, into the interior of the United States. This was an 
2
admission that under his direction, the Department of 
3
Homeland Security is violating the law. 
4
Secretary Mayorkas terminated the Migrant Protec-
5
tion Protocols, which provided a lawful pathway to process 
6
claims and served as a deterrent to illegal immigration and 
7
aliens making fraudulent asylum claims. 
8
Secretary Mayorkas has even refused to tell aliens not 
9
to attempt to enter the United States illegally. During a 
10
White House press briefing on March 1, 2021, Secretary 
11
Mayorkas stated, ‘‘We are not saying, ‘Don’t come’.’’ 
12
As a result of Secretary Mayorkas’s actions and poli-
13
cies, the border and the country are less secure today than 
14
when he began serving as Secretary. U.S. Customs and 
15
Border Protection encounters have increased each month 
16
since he became Secretary. Since February 2021, more 
17
than 800,000 aliens have been encountered by U.S. Cus-
18
toms and Border Protection personnel at the southwest 
19
land border. This number does not include the increasing 
20
number of ‘‘got aways’’, aliens who have evaded Border 
21
Patrol apprehension, of which there have been estimated 
22
to be approximately 1,000 per day.

•HRES 582 IH 
In addition to illegal aliens, Secretary Mayorkas’s 
1
policies have led to a significant increase in illegal drug 
2
smuggling across the southern border. 
3
Secretary Mayorkas’s actions have made the border 
4
less secure and encouraged aliens to enter the United 
5
States illegally, instead of taking actions to maintain oper-
6
ational control of the border. His actions have subverted 
7
the will of Congress and the core tenants of the Constitu-
8
tion. 
9
Wherefore, Alejandro Nicholas Mayorkas, by such 
10
conduct, warrants impeachment and trial, and removal 
11
from office. 
12
ARTICLE II 
13
Alejandro Nicholas Mayorkas, in his conduct while 
14
Secretary of Homeland Security, engaged in a pattern of 
15
conduct that has placed departmental personnel and 
16
American citizens at risk of exposure to and contracting 
17
COVID-19, by refusing to take necessary steps to prevent 
18
potentially contagious illegal aliens from entering the 
19
United States. 
20
On March 20, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control 
21
and Prevention issued an order, pursuant to sections 362 
22
and 365 of the Public Health Service Act (commonly 
23
known as ‘‘title 42’’) (42 U.S.C. 265 and 268), suspending 
24
the right to introduce certain persons into the United 
25
States from countries where a quarantinable commu-

nicable disease exists. This order has been extended mul-
1
tiple times since it was first issued, most recently on Au-
2
gust 2, 2021. According to the Centers for Disease Con-
3
trol and Prevention, this order is necessary ‘‘to protect 
4
the public health from an increase in the serious danger 
5
of the introduction of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID- 
6
19) into the [ports of entry] POEs, and the Border Patrol 
7
stations between POEs, at or near the United States bor-
8
ders with Canada and Mexico.’’. 
9
The law requires Border Patrol agents and other 
10
U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers to enforce 
11
the order. Despite this requirement, Secretary Mayorkas 
12
has refused to faithfully implement this order, as evi-
13
denced by the increasing number of aliens processed by 
14
U.S. Customs and Border Protection under title 8, United 
15
States Code, instead of expelled pursuant to sections 362 
16
and 365 of the Public Health Service Act (commonly 
17
known as ‘‘title 42’’) (42 U.S.C. 265 and 268). According 
18
to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data from Feb-
19
ruary 2021, approximately 26 percent of aliens encoun-
20
tered by the Border Patrol were processed pursuant to 
21
such title 8 instead of pursuant to sections 362 and 365 
22
of the Public Health Service Act (commonly known as 
23
‘‘title 42’’) (42 U.S.C. 265 and 268), and in June 2021, 
24

8 
•HRES 582 IH 
nearly 42 percent of aliens encountered by Border Patrol 
1
were processed pursuant to such title 8. 
2
If the Secretary of Homeland Security is unable to 
3
expel aliens pursuant to sections 362 and 365 of the Pub-
4
lic Health Service Act (commonly known as ‘‘title 42’’) 
5
(42 U.S.C. 265 and 268), the Secretary should not release 
6
aliens into the interior of the United States where they 
7
can spread COVID-19. However, instead of detaining 
8
aliens as required by law, under Secretary Mayorkas’s di-
9
rection, the Department of Homeland Security has re-
10
leased and transported hundreds of thousands of aliens 
11
into the interior of the United States without properly 
12
screening the aliens for COVID-19 to ensure that the 
13
aliens would not spread COVID-19. In many other cases, 
14
aliens known by the Department of Homeland Security 
15
to have COVID-19 were released into the interior of the 
16
United States. These actions have subjected the American 
17
people to unnecessary and avoidable risks and have 
18
strained border communities’ limited health services and 
19
resources.

In failing to use authority under sections 362 and 
21
365 of the Public Health Service Act (commonly known 
22
as ‘‘title 42’’) (42 U.S.C. 265 and 268) to the fullest ex-
23
tent possible, and by releasing potentially contagious 
24
aliens into the interior of the United States and trans-

•HRES 582 IH 
porting said aliens throughout the United States, Sec-
1
retary Mayorkas has placed Department of Homeland Se-
2
curity personnel and the American people at risk. Sub-
3
jecting Department of Homeland Security personnel and 
4
the American people to these risks is unnecessary, avoid-
5
able, and a violation of Secretary Mayorkas’s duty.

Wherefore, Alejandro Nicholas Mayorkas, by such

conduct, warrants impeachment and trial, and removal

from office.
