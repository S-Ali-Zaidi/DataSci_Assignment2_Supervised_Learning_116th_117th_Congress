SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS. 
1
(a) SHORT TITLE.—This Act may be cited as the 
2
‘‘Duty to Report Act’’. 
3
(b) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following find-
4
ings: 
5
(1) Political contributions and express-advocacy 
6
expenditures are an integral aspect of the process by 
7
which Americans elect officials to Federal, State, 
8
and local government offices. 
9
(2) It is fundamental to the definition of a na-
10
tional political community that foreign citizens do 
11
not have a constitutional right to participate in, and 
12
thus may be excluded from, activities of democratic 
13
self-governance. 
14
(3) The United States has a compelling interest 
15
in limiting the participation of foreign citizens in ac-
16
tivities of democratic self-government, and in there-
17
by preventing foreign influence over the United 
18
States political process. 
19
(4) Foreign donations and expenditures have a 
20
corrupting influence on the campaign process and 
21
limiting the activities of foreign citizens in our elec-
22
tions is necessary to preserve the basic conception of 
23
a political community and democratic self-govern-
24
ance.
