A BILL 
To combat trafficking in persons for the removal of their 
organs, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Stop Predatory Organ 
4
Trafficking Act of 2021’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Global Financial Integrity estimates that up 
8
to 10 percent of all transplants rely on organs that

•HR 1434 IH
have been illicitly obtained. These organs are often 
1
bought from vulnerable, impoverished persons. 
2
(2) The illicit organ trade is lucrative; demand 
3
is high, and buyers can pay up to over $200,000 to 
4
secure a kidney outside the legitimate market ac-
5
cording to Global Financial Integrity. By some esti-
6
mates, organ trafficking raises between $840 million 
7
and $1.7 billion. This can bankroll terrorist and 
8
transnational crime activity. 
9
(3) It has been reported that the Islamic State 
10
has used stolen organs to finance its war activities 
11
and to treat injured fighters, sanctioning the re-
12
moval of organs from living captives. 
13
(4) A severe shortage of transplanted organs 
14
helps fuel organ trafficking. As of 2014, according 
15
to the Global Observatory on Donation and Trans-
16
plantation, the 120,000 transplants conducted glob-
17
ally only accounted for 10 percent of the patients 
18
waiting for an organ transplant. 
19
(5) According to a 2013 United Nations report 
20
from the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in per-
21
sons, especially women and children, the economic 
22
and social divisions within and among countries is 
23
notably reflected in the illicit organ trafficking mar-

ket, in which the victims are commonly poor, unem-
1
ployed, and more susceptible to deceit and extortion. 
2
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
3
It is the sense of Congress that establishing efficient 
4
voluntary organ donation systems with strong enforcement 
5
mechanisms is an effective way to combat trafficking in 
6
persons for purposes of the removal of organs. 
7
