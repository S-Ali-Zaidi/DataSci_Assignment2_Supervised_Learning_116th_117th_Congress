•HR 6635 IH
(1) As part of efforts to control equine popu-
1
lations under law, the Bureau of Land Management 
2
is directed to humanely capture wild free-roaming 
3
horses and burros for adoption. 
4
(2) The Bureau of Land Management contracts 
5
directly with private enterprises, including helicopter 
6
companies, to round up equines at rates between 
7
$500–$800 per animal. 
8
(3) The use of helicopters to chase equines over 
9
prolonged distances, usually on rough terrain, is par-
10
ticularly dangerous, and can frighten the animals 
11
and lead to deadly situations. 
12
(4) In January 2022, during the horse gath-
13
ering at the Pancake Complex in central Nevada, a 
14
young colt was chased for miles by helicopter, ulti-
15
mately gravely injuring itself, and necessitating the 
16
need for the animal to be shot and killed. 
17
(5) Since 2011, the Bureau of Land Manage-
18
ment’s top three helicopter contractors have col-
19
lected over $36.8 million in taxpayer funding for 
20
their services, including over $5.3 million since 2021 
21
alone. 
22
(6) Scientific research shows that more humane 
23
and cost-effective alternatives exist to control equine 
24
populations, including fertility controls.

(7) Currently, the Bureau of Land Manage-
1
ment’s Wild Horse and Burro Program spends less 
2
than one percent of its budget on implementing fer-
3
tility controls. 
4
(8) The elimination of helicopters from the Bu-
5
reau of Land Management’s gatherings would pro-
6
vide a more humane method of capturing equines, 
7
and provide significant savings to taxpayers.
