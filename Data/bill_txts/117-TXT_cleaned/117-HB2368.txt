CERTAIN AIRBORNE HAZARDS.

(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
4
gress that— 
5
(1) as in past theaters of operation, Southwest 
6
Asia and its supporting theaters of operation pose 
7
numerous natural and manmade hazards that nega-
8
tively affect the health outcomes of individuals serv-
9
ing in these foreign environments; 
10
(2) toxic exposures from burn pits, oil well 
11
fires, and other regional airborne hazards increase 
12
the potential for immediate and long-term illnesses 
13
to emerge among members of the Armed Forces; 
14
and 
15
(3) legislation is necessary— 
16
(A) to confront the scientific challenge of 
17
producing clear associations between in-theater 
18
toxic exposures and the illnesses confronting 
19
veterans who served in Southwest Asia and be-
20
yond; 
21
(B) to address the insufficient data hin-
22
dering the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, the 
23
Secretary of Defense, and relevant partners 
24
from reaching proactive determinations regard-
25
ing such associations; and
