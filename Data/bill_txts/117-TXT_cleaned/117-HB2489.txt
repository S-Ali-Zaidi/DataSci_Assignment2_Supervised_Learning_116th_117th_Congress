To amend the Communications Act of 1934 to ensure just 
and reasonable charges for confinement facility commu-
nications services, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 2489 IH
(1) Prison, jails, and other confinement facili-
1
ties in the United States have unique telecommuni-
2
cations needs due to safety and security concerns. 
3
(2) Unjust and unreasonable charges for tele-
4
phone and advanced communications services in con-
5
finement facilities negatively impact the safety and 
6
security of communities in the United States by 
7
damaging relationships between incarcerated persons 
8
and their support systems, thereby exacerbating re-
9
cidivism. 
10
(3) All people in the United States, including 
11
anyone who pays for confinement facility commu-
12
nications services, should have access to communica-
13
tions services at charges that are just and reason-
14
able. 
15
(4) Certain markets for confinement facility 
16
communications services are distorted due to reverse 
17
competition, in which the financial interests of the 
18
entity making the buying decision (the confinement 
19
facility) are aligned with the seller (the provider of 
20
confinement facility communications services) and 
21
not the consumer (the incarcerated person or a 
22
member of his or her family). This reverse competi-
23
tion occurs because site commission payments to the 
24
confinement facility from the provider of confine-
25
23:39 May 27, 2021
H2489
3 
•HR 2489 IH
ment facility communications services are the chief 
1
criterion many facilities use to select their provider 
2
of confinement facility communications services. 
3
(5) Charges for confinement facility commu-
4
nications services that have been shown to be unjust 
5
and unreasonable are often a result of site commis-
6
sion payments that far exceed the costs incurred by 
7
the confinement facility in accommodating these 
8
services. 
9
(6) Unjust and unreasonable charges have been 
10
assessed for both audio and video services and for 
11
both intrastate and interstate communications from 
12
confinement facilities. 
13
(7) Mrs. Martha Wright-Reed led a campaign 
14
for just communications rates for incarcerated peo-
15
ple for over a decade. 
16
(8) Mrs. Wright-Reed was the lead plaintiff in 
17
Wright v. Corrections Corporation of America, CA 
18
No. 00–293 (GK) (D.D.C. 2001). 
19
(9) That case ultimately led to the Wright Peti-
20
tion at the Federal Communications Commission, 
21
CC Docket No. 96–128 (November 3, 2003). 
22
(10) As a grandmother, Mrs. Wright-Reed was 
23
forced to choose between purchasing medication and 
24
communicating with her incarcerated grandson.

(11) Mrs. Wright-Reed passed away on Janu-
1
ary 18, 2015, before fully realizing her dream of just 
2
communications rates for all people.
