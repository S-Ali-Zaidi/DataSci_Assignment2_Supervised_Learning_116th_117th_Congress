Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
(a) FINDINGS RELATED TO THE UNITED STATES 
2
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM.—Congress finds the fol-
3
lowing: 
4
(1) Although the United States has less than 5 
5
percent of the world’s population, the United States 
6
holds approximately 19 percent of the world’s incar-
7
cerated population and has the highest rate of incar-
8
ceration in the world, with more than 1,700,000 
9
people incarcerated in State and Federal prisons and 
10
local jails. 
11
(2) The prison population of the United States 
12
has increased by more than 270 percent over a 40- 
13
year period preceding the date of enactment of this 
14
Act. 
15
(3) The United States incarcerates citizens of 
16
the United States at 5 to 10 times the rate of other 
17
industrialized nations. 
18
(4) The face of incarceration in the United 
19
States is not exclusively male. Although less than 5 
20
percent of women in the world live in the United 
21
States, the United States houses nearly 30 percent 
22
of the world’s incarcerated women. 
23
(5) The growth of the incarceration of women 
24
in the United States has outpaced that of men by 
25
nearly 2-to-1, growing more than 475 percent be-
26
00:40 Dec 10, 2022
H9431

•HR 9431 IH
tween 1980 and 2020. Fifty-eight percent of incar-
1
cerated women are mothers of minor children and 
2
most are the primary caretakers for their children. 
3
(6) The overall prison population of the United 
4
States peaked in 2009 and declined at an annual 
5
rate of 1 percent during the subsequent decade. At 
6
this pace, it would take until 2078, or 56 years, to 
7
reduce the prison population by 50 percent. 
8
(7) In 2020, the prison population declined by 
9
15 percent in response to safety precautions related 
10
to the COVID–19 pandemic, but some prison popu-
11
lations have since bounced back up. 
12
(8) Nearly 50 percent of the United States 
13
Federal prison population in 2022 is incarcerated 
14
for a drug trafficking offense. 
15
(b) FINDINGS RELATED TO THE NEED FOR A SEC-
16
OND LOOK.—Congress finds the following: 
17
(1) A second look at the sentences for incarcer-
18
ated individuals is needed. 
19
(2) Life sentences of imprisonment and long 
20
sentences without the possibility of review violate 
21
human rights standards. 
22
(3) One out of 7 incarcerated individuals is cur-
23
rently serving a life sentence or a virtual life sen-
24
tence of 50 years or longer. More than 25 percent 
25
00:40 Dec 10, 2022
H9431
4 
•HR 9431 IH
of those individuals are sentenced to life without pa-
1
role. One out of every 15 women in prison, or nearly 
2
7,000 women, is serving a life sentence or virtual life 
3
sentence. 
4
(4) In 2020, 147,920 people were serving a life 
5
sentence or virtual life sentence in the United 
6
States, and 55,945 people were serving a sentence of 
7
life without parole, compared to a total of 63 people 
8
serving a life sentence without the possibility of re-
9
lease in the United Kingdom. 
10
(5) Mandatory minimum penalties continue to 
11
result in long sentences in the Federal prison sys-
12
tem, and— 
13
(A) as of 2016— 
14
(i) 55.7 percent of the Federal prison 
15
population had been sentenced under a 
16
mandatory minimum provision; and 
17
(ii) 25 percent of Federal prisoners 
18
serving life or virtual life sentences have 
19
been convicted of nonviolent crimes, includ-
20
ing 30 percent for a drug crime; and 
21
(B) in 2021, the average sentence length 
22
for individuals who were convicted of an offense 
23
carrying a mandatory minimum penalty was 
24
139 months of imprisonment. 
25
00:40 Dec 10, 2022
H9431
5 
•HR 9431 IH
(6) Among those individuals serving life without 
1
parole sentences, 40 percent have been convicted of 
2
a drug related crime. 
3
(7) The United States has much more punitive 
4
sentencing laws than the rest of the world, as— 
5
(A) sentence lengths in most European 
6
countries rarely exceed 20 years; 
7
(B) Norway abolished life sentences in 
8
1981, and under Norwegian law, the maximum 
9
prison term is 21 years; 
10
(C) in Denmark and Sweden, individuals 
11
serving life sentences can be released after 12 
12
years and 18 years of imprisonment, respec-
13
tively; and 
14
(D) in Latin America, only 6 out of 19 
15
countries maintain statutes that allow life im-
16
prisonment. 
17
(8) With the abolition of parole under the Sen-
18
tencing Reform Act of 1984 (Public Law 98–473; 
19
98 Stat. 1987), there are extremely limited options 
20
for review of Federal sentences, which differs greatly 
21
from the rest of the world, as— 
22
(A) Belgium requires a parole review of life 
23
sentences after 10 years; 
24
00:40 Dec 10, 2022
H9431
6 
•HR 9431 IH
(B) Germany requires a parole review of 
1
life sentences after 15 years; and 
2
(C) the International Criminal Court re-
3
quires a parole review of life sentences after 25 
4
years. 
5
(9) An incarcerated individual should not be 
6
precluded from receiving a second look review of 
7
their sentence because of the nature of the crime for 
8
which the individual was convicted, as— 
9
(A) individuals tend to age out of criminal 
10
activity starting around 25 years of age; 
11
(B) released individuals over the age of 50 
12
have a very low recidivism rate; 
13
(C) several studies, State policies and pro-
14
grams, and the National Institute of Correc-
15
tions of the Bureau of Prisons consider incar-
16
cerated individuals aged 50 and above to be el-
17
derly; 
18
(D) incarcerated people age at an acceler-
19
ated rate because they are more likely than the 
20
general public to experience stresses including 
21
long histories of alcohol and drug misuse, insuf-
22
ficient diet, lack of medical care, financial 
23
struggles, and stress of maintaining safety 
24
while behind bars; 
25
00:40 Dec 10, 2022
H9431
7 
•HR 9431 IH
(E) the Office of the Inspector General of 
1
the Department of Justice has found that 
2
‘‘aging inmates commit less misconduct while 
3
incarcerated and have a lower rate of re-arrest 
4
once released’’ and has recommended the early 
5
release of aging inmates to help manage the in-
6
mate population and reduce costs at the Bureau 
7
of Prisons; 
8
(F) the cost to State taxpayers to incar-
9
cerate the approximately 250,000 individuals 
10
aged 50 or older behind bars as of the date of 
11
enactment 
of 
this 
Act 
is 
approximately 
12
$16,000,000,000 each year; 
13
(G) incarceration of individuals beyond the 
14
age during which the individuals are likely to 
15
commit crime is a drain on taxpayer dollars 
16
that does nothing to increase public safety; 
17
(H) individuals are capable of redemption; 
18
and 
19
(I) in the words of Bryan Stevenson, ‘‘each 
20
of us is more than the worst thing we’ve ever 
21
done’’.
