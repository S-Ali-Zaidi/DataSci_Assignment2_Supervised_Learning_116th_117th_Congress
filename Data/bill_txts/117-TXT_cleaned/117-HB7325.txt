(1) The Chinese Communist Party poses perva-
1
sive and growing threats to United States domestic 
2
national security. 
3
(2) On November 1, 2018, the Department of 
4
Justice launched a new initiative, referred to as the 
5
‘‘China Initiative’’, to address some of the most crit-
6
ical threats to United States domestic national secu-
7
rity posed by the Chinese regime. 
8
(3) The China Initiative has sought to identify 
9
and prosecute Chinese trade secret theft and eco-
10
nomic espionage and to protect American critical in-
11
frastructure and supply chains from covert influence. 
12
(4) The Chinese Communist Party’s aggression 
13
is a pervasive and growing problem, as approxi-
14
mately 80 percent of all Federal economic espionage 
15
prosecutions involve alleged conduct that would ben-
16
efit the Chinese Communist Party, and about 60 
17
percent of all United States trade secret theft cases 
18
have a nexus to the Chinese Communist Party. 
19
(5) According to the Commission on the Theft 
20
of American Intellectual Property, the Chinese Com-
21
munist Party’s theft of United States intellectual 
22
property is estimated to cost the United States econ-
23
omy 
between 
$225,000,000,000 
to 
24
$600,000,000,000 annually.

(6) The Department of Justice has identified 
1
academia as one of the sectors of the United States 
2
economy that are most vulnerable to trade secret 
3
theft and economic espionage by the Chinese Com-
4
munist Party. The Chinese Communist Party ex-
5
ploits the American tradition of openness and the 
6
free flow of ideas for its own benefit. 
7
(7) The widespread and dangerous threats 
8
posed by the Chinese Communist Party has been un-
9
derscored by the most senior-level United States 
10
Government officials. 
11
(8) On November 1, 2018, the former Assistant 
12
Attorney for the Department of Justice’s National 
13
Security Division stated, ‘‘China wants the fruits of 
14
America’s brainpower to harvest the seeds of its 
15
planned economic dominance. Preventing this from 
16
happening will take all of us, here at the Justice De-
17
partment, across the U.S. Government, and within 
18
the private sector’’. 
19
(9) On June 24, 2020, the former National Se-
20
curity Advisor of the White House stated that the 
21
Chinese Communist Party ‘‘is seeking leverage over 
22
individual Americans’’ and ‘‘collecting your most in-
23
timate data—your words, your actions, your pur-
24
chases, your whereabouts, your health records, your

social media posts, your texts, and mapping your 
1
network of friends, family, and acquaintances’’. 
2
(10) On July 7, 2020, the Director of the Fed-
3
eral Bureau of Investigation warned that ‘‘[t]he 
4
greatest long-term threat to our nation’s information 
5
and intellectual property, and to our economic vital-
6
ity, is the counterintelligence and economic espio-
7
nage threat from China’’. 
8
(11) The Director of the Federal Bureau of In-
9
vestigation added that ‘‘[w]e’ve now reached the 
10
point where the FBI is opening a new China-related 
11
counterintelligence case about every 10 hours. Of the 
12
nearly 5,000 active FBI counterintelligence cases 
13
currently underway across the country, almost half 
14
are related to China’’. 
15
(12) On July 16, 2020, the former Attorney 
16
General of the Department of Justice stated that 
17
‘‘[t]he ultimate ambition of China’s rulers isn’t to 
18
trade with the United States. It is to raid the 
19
United States’’. 
20
(13) On July 23, 2020, the former Secretary of 
21
the Department of State stated that ‘‘[w]e [the 
22
United States] must admit a hard truth that should 
23
guide us in the years and decades to come, that if 
24
we want a free 21st century, and not the Chinese

century of which Xi Jingping dreams, the old para-
1
digm of blind engagement with China simply won’t 
2
get it done. We must not continue it and we must 
3
not return it’’. 
4
(14) Actions by the Biden administration have 
5
raised serious concerns about its commitment to 
6
confront the national security threats posed by the 
7
Chinese Communist Party. 
8
(15) In July 2021, the Biden administration’s 
9
Department of Justice moved to dismiss charges 
10
against several suspected Chinese researchers ac-
11
cused of concealing ties to the Chinese military. 
12
(16) On February 23, 2022, the Biden adminis-
13
tration’s Department of Justice announced the end 
14
of its national security program aimed at prioritizing 
15
and countering legitimate threats of economic espio-
16
nage, theft of American intellectual property and re-
17
search, and other threats posed by the Chinese Com-
18
munist Party to the United States. 
19
(17) This action comes at a time when Presi-
20
dent Biden’s leadership in only a short period has 
21
resulted in many foreign policy missteps, notably in 
22
Afghanistan, Russia, and Iran. 
23
(18) The United States efforts to combat the 
24
Chinese Communist Party’s malign activities should
