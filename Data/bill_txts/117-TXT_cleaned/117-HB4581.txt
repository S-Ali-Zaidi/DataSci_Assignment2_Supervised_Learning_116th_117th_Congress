11
County, Mamie Till-Mobley cautioned him about the 
12
dangers of the segregated South, instructing him to 
13
‘‘be very careful . . . humble himself to the extent 
14
of getting down on his knees’’. 
15

tured that it was only recognizable from his father’s

ring on his finger.

(9) When Emmett Till’s body was recovered,

minal, falling in grief at its sight. 
11
(11) Mamie Till-Mobley demonstrated exem-
12
plary bravery, requesting an open-casket funeral for 
13
her son, because in her words, ‘‘everybody needed to

16
tors viewed Emmett Till’s body at the Roberts Tem-
17
ple Church of God in Christ.

23
scribe Emmett Till’s open-casket funeral as the 
24
‘‘big-bang’’ of the civil rights movement.
