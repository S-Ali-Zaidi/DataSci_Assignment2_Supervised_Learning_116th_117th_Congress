RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the designation of November 21, 
2021, as the ‘‘National Warrior Call Day’’ and recog-
nizing the importance of connecting our warriors to sup-
port structures necessary to transitioning from the bat-
tlefield. 
Whereas establishing an annual ‘‘National Warrior Call Day’’ 
will draw attention to those members of the Armed 
Forces whose connection to one another is key to our vet-
erans and first responders who may be dangerously dis-
connected from family, friends, and support systems;

Whereas the number of suicides of members of the Armed 
Forces serving on active duty increased to 377 in 2020, 
a figure up from 348 the previous year; 
Whereas the epidemic of veteran suicide has steadily in-
creased since 2014 with 6,435 veterans taking their own 
lives in 2018; 
Whereas, after adjusting for sex and age, the rate of veteran 
suicide in 2018 was 27.5 per 100,000 individuals, higher 
than the rate among all United States adults at 18.3; 
Whereas more veterans have died by suicide in the last 10 
years than members of the Armed Forces who died from 
combat in Vietnam; 
Whereas roughly two-thirds of these veterans who take their 
own lives have had no contact with the Department of 
Veterans Affairs; 
Whereas the COVID–19 pandemic has only increased isola-
tion and disconnection, further exacerbating mental and 
physical ailments such as post-traumatic stress disorder 
and traumatic brain injury; 
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention note 
that law enforcement officers and firefighters are more 
likely to die by suicide than in the line of duty, and emer-
gency medical services providers are 1.39 times more 
likely to die by suicide than members of the general pub-
lic; 
Whereas invisible wounds linked to an underlying and 
undiagnosed traumatic brain injury can mirror many 
mental health conditions, a problem that can be ad-
dressed through connections to members of the Armed 
Forces and veterans who can better identify and address 
these wounds;

•HRES 512 IH 
Whereas urgent research is needed to highlight the connec-
tion between traumatic brain injury as a root cause of in-
visible wounds and suicide by members of the Armed 
Forces and veterans; and 
Whereas November 21, 2021, would be an appropriate date 
to designate as the ‘‘National Warrior Call Day’’: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the designation of a ‘‘National 
2
Warrior Call Day’’; 
3
(2) encourages all Americans, especially mem-
4
bers of the Armed Forces serving on active duty and 
5
veterans, to call up a warrior, have an honest con-
6
versation, and connect them with support, under-
7
standing that making a warrior call could save a life; 
8
and 
9
(3) implores all Americans to recommit them-
10
selves to engaging with members of the Armed 
11
Forces through ‘‘National Warrior Call Day’’ and 
12
constructive efforts that result in solutions and 
13
treatment for the invisible scars they carry.
