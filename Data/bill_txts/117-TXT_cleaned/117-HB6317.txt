•HR 6317 IH
(1) Cooperative businesses operate on the basis 
1
of 1 member, 1 vote. 
2
(2) Cooperatives have helped to improve the 
3
economic conditions of the people of the United 
4
States for more than a century by increasing com-
5
petition and helping small players gain parity in the 
6
market. 
7
(3) Research has shown that cooperatives are 
8
more resilient to economic business cycles than other 
9
business models because cooperatives require mem-
10
ber-owners of the cooperative to work together and 
11
prepare for the future. 
12
(4) The mission of the Small Business Adminis-
13
tration (referred to in this Act as the ‘‘Administra-
14
tion’’) is to help the people of the United States 
15
start, build, and grow businesses. 
16
(5) The requirement of the Administration that 
17
some borrowers provide a personal guarantee with 
18
respect to certain Administration loans has pre-
19
vented cooperatives from accessing the safe and af-
20
fordable financing available from the Administration.
