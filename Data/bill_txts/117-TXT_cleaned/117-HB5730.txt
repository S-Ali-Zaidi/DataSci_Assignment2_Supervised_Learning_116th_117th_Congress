A BILL 
To amend part E of title IV of the Social Security Act 
to require States to prohibit genital surgery on foster 
children with variations in sex characteristics who are 
under six years of age as a condition of receiving grants 
under such part. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. PREAMBLE. 
3
(a) The Congress opposes all forms of prejudice, bias, 
4
and discrimination, and affirms its commitment to the 
5
dignity and autonomy of all people, including those born 
6
with variations in their physical sex characteristics. The

Congress especially notes the importance of protecting 
1
children within the guardianship of the foster care system. 
2
(b) ‘‘Variations in physical sex characteristics’’ is an 
3
umbrella term used to describe a wide range of natural 
4
bodily variations in traits including genitals, gonads, hor-
5
mone function, and chromosomal patterns. 
6
(c) People born with variations in their physical sex 
7
characteristics are a part of the fabric of the Nation’s di-
8
versity and are equally entitled to dignity and bodily au-
9
tonomy. 
10
(d) People born with variations in their physical sex 
11
characteristics are regularly subjected in infancy to sur-
12
geries to change the appearance or function of those vari-
13
ations, even though such surgeries may result in lasting 
14
harm. 
15
(e) The Congress recognizes that surgeries on infants 
16
with variations in their physical sex characteristics are 
17
often justified by generalized assumptions about people’s 
18
preferences about their bodies’ appearance and function. 
19
These assumptions perpetuate gender stereotypes and 
20
may not reflect an individual’s actual preferences when 
21
they are capable of articulating their wishes. 
22
(f) Not all persons with variations in their physical 
23
sex characteristics will need or desire the surgeries that 
24
may be recommended or performed on them in infancy.

•HR 5730 IH
People born with variations in their physical sex character-
1
istics should be free to choose whether to undergo sur-
2
geries that impact not only their bodily autonomy but also 
3
their reproductive and sexual futures. 
4
(g) The Congress recognizes that leading pediatric 
5
hospitals have begun to institute partial bans on these sur-
6
geries on patients who are too young to participate in a 
7
meaningful discussion of the implications of these sur-
8
geries. 
9
(h) Therefore, the Congress calls upon the States to 
10
hold health professionals responsible for safeguarding the 
11
bodily autonomy of people born with variations in their 
12
physical sex characteristics and ensuring patient-centered 
13
care that conforms with best practices in the medical pro-
14
fession by ending the practice of performing specified sur-
15
geries on such children when they are under the age of 
16
six and the surgery is not required to address an imme-
17
diate risk of physical harm, as provided.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
19
The Congress finds the following: 
20
(1) Individuals with variations in their physical 
21
sex characteristics may present with differences in 
22
genital anatomy, internal reproductive structures, 
23
chromosomes, or hormonal variations. ‘‘Intersex’’ re-
24
fers to the variety of different physical indicators 
25
17:41 Nov 01, 2021
H5730

•HR 5730 IH
that create those differences. As many as 1.7 per-
1
cent of babies are born with physical sex characteris-
2
tics which do not conform to the expectations for a 
3
typical male or female. The vast majority of babies 
4
born with these variations do not require surgical 
5
intervention related to their physical sex characteris-
6
tics immediately, if at all. 
7
(2) Beginning in the 1950s physicians in the 
8
United States began performing irreversible sur-
9
geries (often referred to as genital-normalizing sur-
10
geries) on infants with variations in their physical 
11
sex characteristics without medical justification. 
12
(3) As many as two-thirds of these irreversible 
13
surgeries occur on infants under the age of two. A 
14
literature review of genital surgery conducted on 
15
children with variations in their physical sex charac-
16
teristics published in the Journal of Steroid Bio-
17
chemistry and Molecular Biology found that between 
18
2005 and 2012 the average age of patients was 11.2 
19
months old and the median age was 9.9 months at 
20
initial surgery. 
21
(4) These surgeries, which include unnecessary 
22
infant vaginoplasties, clitoral reductions and reces-
23
sions, and removal of gonadal tissues, are often per-
24
formed before a child can even speak or stand, 
25
17:41 Nov 01, 2021
H5730
5 
•HR 5730 IH
meaning the individual is excluded from the decision 
1
whether to undergo these irreversible procedures. 
2
(5) There is evidence that these surgeries cause 
3
severe psychological and physiological harm when 
4
performed without the informed consent of the indi-
5
vidual. These harms may include scarring, chronic 
6
pain, urinary incontinence, loss of sexual sensation 
7
and function, sterilization, depression, post-trau-
8
matic stress disorder, suicidality, and incorrect gen-
9
der assignment. 
10
(6) A number of domestic and international 
11
human rights organizations have conducted thorough 
12
inquiries into genital surgeries on infants with vari-
13
ations in their physical sex characteristics and have 
14
concluded that these procedures are cruel and cata-
15
strophic, as follows: 
16
(A) 
The 
United 
Nations 
Special 
17
Rapporteur on Torture and Other Cruel, Inhu-
18
man or Degrading Treatment or Punishment 
19
explained in 2013, ‘‘children who are born with 
20
atypical sex characteristics are often subject to 
21
irreversible sex assignment, involuntary steri-
22
lization, involuntary genital normalizing sur-
23
gery, performed without their informed consent, 
24
or that of their parents, ‘in an attempt to fix 
25
17:41 Nov 01, 2021
H5730

•HR 5730 IH
their sex,’ leaving them with permanent, irre-
1
versible infertility and causing severe mental 
2
suffering.’’. 
3
(B) The United Nations High Commis-
4
sioner for Human Rights explained in 2015, 
5
‘‘medically unnecessary surgeries and other 
6
invasive treatment of intersex babies and chil-
7
dren . . . are rarely discussed and even more 
8
rarely investigated or prosecuted. . . . The re-
9
sult is impunity for the perpetrators; lack of 
10
remedy for victims; and a gap between legisla-
11
tion and the lived realities of intersex people.’’. 
12
(C) The World Health Organization ex-
13
plained in 2015, that children with variations in 
14
their physical sex characteristics have been 
15
‘‘subjected to medically unnecessary, often irre-
16
versible, interventions that may have lifelong 
17
consequences for their physical and mental 
18
health, including irreversible termination of all 
19
or some of their reproductive and sexual capac-
20
ity. . . . Human rights bodies and ethical and 
21
health professional organizations have rec-
22
ommended that free and informed consent 
23
should be ensured in medical interventions for 
24
people with intersex conditions, including full 
25

•HR 5730 IH
information, orally and in writing, on the sug-
1
gested treatment, its justification and alter-
2
natives.’’. 
3
(D) Physicians for Human Rights has 
4
‘‘call[ed] for an end to all medically unneces-
5
sary surgical procedures on intersex children 
6
before they are able to give meaningful consent 
7
to such surgeries.’’. 
8
(E) Human Rights Watch concluded that 
9
these surgeries are ‘‘often catastrophic, the sup-
10
posed benefits are largely unproven, and there 
11
are generally no urgent health considerations at 
12
stake. Procedures that could be delayed until 
13
intersex children are old enough to decide 
14
whether they want them are instead performed 
15
on infants who then have to live with the con-
16
sequences for a lifetime.’’. 
17
(7) Intersex advocacy groups led by individuals 
18
with variations in their physical sex characteristics 
19
themselves advocate for the postponing or banning 
20
of these surgeries, as follows: 
21
(A) Those subjected to surgery to alter 
22
their variations in sex characteristics at a 
23
young age express despair over the fact that 
24
they were unable to make these decisions for 
25
17:41 Nov 01, 2021
H5730
8 
•HR 5730 IH
themselves, publishing about their experiences 
1
in major news outlets: ‘‘I know firsthand the 
2
devastating impact [these surgeries] can have, 
3
not just on our bodies but on our souls. We are 
4
erased before we can even tell our doctors who 
5
we are. Every human rights organization that 
6
has considered the practice has condemned it, 
7
some even to the point of recognizing it as akin 
8
to torture.’’. 
9
(B) Young people born with variations in 
10
their physical sex characteristics who have been 
11
able to participate in these life-altering deci-
12
sions are thriving, such as a young California 
13
resident with variation of sex characteristics 
14
who was not forced to undergo surgery in in-
15
fancy and instead participated in the decision at 
16
the age of 16. They told reporters that for 
17
them, surgery ‘‘was the right choice, but that’s 
18
very much an anomaly for intersex people. . . . 
19
The important thing was that I was old enough 
20
to make that decision for myself.’’. 
21
(8) The United States Department of State has 
22
acknowledged Intersex Awareness Day in both 2016 
23
and 2017 by recognizing the harm of these sur-
24
geries. In both years the Department released state-
25
02:33 Nov 02, 2021
H5730

•HR 5730 IH
ments recognizing that ‘‘at a young age, intersex 
1
persons routinely face forced medical surgeries with-
2
out free or informed consent. These interventions 
3
jeopardize their physical integrity and ability to live 
4
freely.’’. 
5
(9) In light of ongoing advocacy by the intersex 
6
community, in 2005 the San Francisco Human 
7
Rights Commission performed an investigation into 
8
this topic and issued an in-depth report, recom-
9
mending that ‘‘ ‘normalizing’ interventions should 
10
not occur in infancy or childhood. Any procedures 
11
that are not medically necessary should not be per-
12
formed unless the patient gives their legal consent.’’. 
13
(10) Physicians who have participated in these 
14
surgeries have also expressed remorse that their 
15
training did not properly prepare them to respect 
16
the bodily autonomy of people born with variations 
17
in their physical sex characteristics. As a Stanford- 
18
educated urologist explains: ‘‘I know intersex women 
19
who have never experienced orgasm because clitoral 
20
surgery destroyed their sensation; men who under-
21
went a dozen penile surgeries before they even hit 
22
puberty; people who had false vaginas created that 
23
scarred and led to a lifetime of pain during inter-
24
course . . . the psychological damage caused by 
25
17:41 Nov 01, 2021
H5730
10 
•HR 5730 IH
intervention is just as staggering, as evidenced by 
1
generations of intersex adults dealing with post-trau-
2
matic stress disorder, problems with intimacy and 
3
severe depression. Some were even surgically as-
4
signed a gender at birth, only to grow up identifying 
5
with the opposite gender.’’. 
6
(11) When the physical health of an infant born 
7
with variations in their physical sex characteristics is 
8
threatened and medical attention cannot be safely 
9
deferred, all therapeutic treatment options should re-
10
main available to children, families, and medical pro-
11
fessionals to ensure that the imminent physical dan-
12
ger is addressed. 
13
(12) The United States should serve as a model 
14
of competent and ethical medical care and has a 
15
compelling interest in protecting the physical and 
16
psychological well-being of children, including those 
17
born with variations in their physical sex character-
18
istics.
