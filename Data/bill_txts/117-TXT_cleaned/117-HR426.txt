RESOLUTION 
Expressing opposition to removing sanctions with respect 
to the Nord Stream II pipeline. 
Whereas Nord Stream II is an underwater natural gas pipe-
line that, if completed, will transport natural gas from 
the Russian Federation through the Baltic Sea to Ger-
many; 
Whereas Russia controls the supply of nearly 40 percent of 
Europe’s natural gas and 11 European countries rely on 
Russian natural gas for 75 percent or more for their an-
nual needs; 
Whereas Nord Stream II will increase Russian control over 
the European energy market;

Whereas President Joe Biden has called Nord Stream II a 
‘‘bad deal for Europe’’; 
Whereas, in his confirmation hearing, Secretary of State 
Antony Blinken stated, ‘‘I am determined to do whatever 
we can to prevent that completion.’’; 
Whereas the Biden administration has identified Nord 
Stream II AG and Nord Stream II AG head Matthias 
Warnig as engaged in sanctionable activity; 
Whereas a national interest waiver was granted by the Biden 
administration to Nord Stream II AG and Nord Stream 
II AG head Matthias Warnig; 
Whereas it is in the national interest of the United States to 
support Ukraine’s sovereignty, stand with European al-
lies against Russian aggression, and fight corruption; 
Whereas Nord Stream II AG is in part driven by Gerhard 
Schroeder, former German chancellor and now Putin as-
sociate, who has become emblematic of autocrats hiring 
former western officials; 
Whereas 
the 
Biden 
administration 
has 
stated 
that 
anticorruption is one of its policy priorities and Nord 
Stream II provides a pathway for corruption to enter 
western 
democracies, 
compounding 
Russia’s 
weaponization of corruption; 
Whereas the Biden administration has stated that climate ac-
tion is one of its policy priorities and Nord Stream II ex-
acerbates climate change; 
Whereas Donald Tusk, the former President of the European 
Council, stated that Nord Stream II would not help di-
versification, nor would it reduce European dependency 
on Russian gas;

Whereas it has been longstanding United States policy to 
support European energy security through diversification 
of supplies, such as the Southern Gas Corridor which will 
deliver Caspian Sea energy resources to Southern and 
Central Europe; 
Whereas the existing Ukrainian gas transit system currently 
has 55,000,000,000 cubic meters of spare capacity which 
is equal to Nord Stream II’s planned capacity; 
Whereas Ukraine has been a stable and reliable transit hub 
for energy flowing to European destinations; 
Whereas Russia’s geopolitical interest in Nord Stream II is 
not to increase European energy security, but rather to 
drive a wedge between countries in Europe and dras-
tically diminish Ukraine’s political leverage regarding 
Russia and the significant income Ukraine derives from 
transit fees; 
Whereas Members of Congress on a bipartisan basis have ex-
pressed strong opposition to Nord Stream II through 
statements and legislation; and 
Whereas Congress has mandated sanctions against those in-
volved in the construction of the Nord Stream II pipeline 
on the basis of its constitutional authority to regulate 
commerce: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) finds that Nord Stream II is a drastic step 
2
backwards for European energy security and United 
3
States interests; 
4
(2) calls upon the Biden administration to re-
5
voke the national interest waiver granted to Nord
