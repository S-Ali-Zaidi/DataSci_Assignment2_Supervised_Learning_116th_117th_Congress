1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2

3
FORCE SHIPS IN THE COMBAT FORCES OF 
4

7

posed of 10 amphibious assault ships general-pur-
1
pose and multi-purpose, and 21 amphibious trans-
2
port dock types, in order to meet global commit-
3
ments. 
4
(2) Amphibious warfare ships provide fleet com-
5
manders and joint force commanders with credible 
6
deterrence, support active campaigning strategies, 
7
and offer an option for the rapid aggregation of for-
8
ward, tailored, and ready forces to respond to crisis 
9
and conflict. 
10
(3) Due to their utility across the spectrum of 
11
competition and conflict, including substantial deter-
12
rent value during periods of uncertainty, amphibious 
13
warfare ships are one of the assets most requested 
14
by combatant commanders. 
15
(4) A single three-ship amphibious ready group 
16
formation with an embarked Marine Expeditionary 
17
Unit provides over 2,000 sailors and marines, 5th 
18
generation fighters, helicopters, tiltrotor aircraft, 
19
anti-air capabilities, lethal fires, and a suite of sen-
20
sor and communication systems that provide fleet 
21
and joint force commanders with tailored options 
22
that support naval expeditionary and joint force 
23
campaigns.

(5) Amphibious-based forces employ these capa-
1
bilities from sovereign territory aboard ship, without 
2
the need for overseas basing, as such these forces 
3
provide a unique and consequential offering to the 
4
joint force. 
5
(6) Reductions in amphibious warfare ship pro-
6
curement profile and decommissioning plans that re-
7
sult in less than the proscribed composition of 31 
8
amphibious ships will negatively impact the ability of 
9
the Navy to execute distributed maritime operations; 
10
combatant commanders’ access to a flexible, nimble, 
11
and capable force; and the Nation’s ability to force 
12
project. 
13
(7) Strategic global competition will continue to 
14
require the need for forward postured, combat cred-
15
ible, strategically maneuverable forces, capable of op-
16
erating across a range of missions and threat envi-
17
ronments—amphibious warfare ships are critical to 
18
providing this capability. 
19
(b) MINIMUM REQUIREMENT.—Section 8062 of title 
20
10, United States Code, is amended— 
21
(1) by redesignating subsections (c) through (f) 
22
as subsections (d) through (g), respectively; and 
23
(2) by inserting after subsection (b) the fol-
24
lowing new subsection:

‘‘(c) The naval combat forces of the Navy shall in-
1

2

poses of this subsection, an operational amphibious battle 
4
force ship includes such a ship that is temporarily unavail-
5
able for worldwide deployment due to routine or scheduled 
6
maintenance or repair.’’.
