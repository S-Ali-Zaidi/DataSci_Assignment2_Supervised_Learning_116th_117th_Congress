Congress makes the following findings:

•HR 7710 IH
(1) Trafficking in persons is a multi-billion dol-
1
lar transnational illicit enterprise. 
2
(2) Globally, millions of people, including chil-
3
dren, are trafficked each year through sexual exploi-
4
tation or forced labor. 
5
(3) Human trafficking impacts every country 
6
around the world, including the United States, 
7
whether as the country of origin, transit, or destina-
8
tion, or combination of all three. 
9
(4) Science and technology have important roles 
10
to play in combatting human trafficking. The 2019 
11
United Nations Interagency Coordination Group 
12
Against Trafficking in Persons report states that 
13
technology can help practitioners combat trafficking, 
14
such as by aiding investigations, enhancing prosecu-
15
tions, raising awareness, providing service to victims, 
16
and shedding light on the make-up and operation of 
17
trafficking networks. 
18
(5) Limited data sources and data fragmenta-
19
tion are major barriers to anti-trafficking efforts, 
20
both domestically and globally, and has limited the 
21
ability to carry out rigorous study of human traf-
22
ficking.

(6) Key areas of need for research and tech-
24

ongoing efforts to combat trafficking, understanding

long and short-term needs of victims and survivors,

12
with human trafficking, and evaluating the efficacy 
13
and impact of anti-trafficking interventions.

(7) To improve efforts to counter human traf-
15
ficking, the Federal Government must address major 
16
barriers to human trafficking research and tech-
17

18
ordination of research efforts and information shar-
