SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) In the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Re-
3
gion of China, the Government of the People’s Re-
4
public of China has, since 2017, arbitrarily detained 
5
as many as 1.8 million Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, 
6
and members of other Muslim minority groups in a 
7
system of extrajudicial mass internment camps, in 
8
addition to arbitrarily detaining many in formal 
9
prisons and detention centers, and has subjected de-
10
tainees to forced labor, torture, political indoctrina-
11
tion, and other severe human rights abuses. 
12
(2) Forced labor exists within the Xinjiang 
13
Uyghur Autonomous Region’s system of mass in-
14
ternment camps, and throughout the region, and is 
15
confirmed by the testimony of former camp detain-
16
ees, satellite imagery, official media reports, publicly 
17
available documents, official statements, and official 
18
leaked documents from the Government of the Peo-
19
ple’s Republic of China as part of a targeted cam-
20
paign of repression of Muslim ethnic minorities. 
21
(3) In addition to reports from researchers and 
22
civil society groups documenting evidence that many 
23
factories and other suppliers in the Xinjiang Uyghur 
24
Autonomous Region are exploiting forced labor, the 
25
Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and

Security on July 22, 2020, added eleven entities to 
1
the entity list after determining the entities had 
2
been ‘‘implicated in human rights violations and 
3
abuses in the implementation of China’s campaign of 
4
repression, mass arbitrary detention, forced labor 
5
and high-technology surveillance against Uyghurs, 
6
Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority 
7
groups in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Re-
8
gion’’. 
9
(4) Audits and efforts to vet products and sup-
10
ply chains in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Re-
11
gion are unreliable due to the extent forced labor 
12
has been integrated into the regional economy, the 
13
mixing of involuntary labor with voluntary labor, the 
14
inability of witnesses to speak freely about working 
15
conditions given government surveillance and coer-
16
cion, and the incentive of government officials to 
17
conceal government-sponsored forced labor. 
18
(5) The Department of State’s June 2020 Traf-
19
ficking in Persons Report found that ‘‘Authorities 
20
offer subsidies incentivizing Chinese companies to 
21
open factories in close proximity to the internment 
22
camps, and to receive transferred detainees at sat-
23
ellite manufacturing sites in other provinces. Local 
24
governments receive additional funds for each in-

mate forced to work in these sites at a fraction of 
1
minimum wage or without any compensation.’’. 
2
(6) U.S. Customs and Border Protection has 
3
issued 11 ‘‘Withhold Release Orders’’ on products 
4
suspected to be produced with prison or forced labor 
5
in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. Prod-
6
ucts subject to the ‘‘Withhold Release Orders’’ in-
7
clude all cotton, cotton products, tomatoes, and to-
8
mato products as well as certain garments, hair 
9
products, apparel, computer parts, and other prod-
10
ucts. 
11
(7) In its 2019 Annual Report, the Congres-
12
sional-Executive Commission on China (CECC) 
13
found that products reportedly produced with forced 
14
labor by current and former mass internment camp 
15
detainees included textiles, electronics, food prod-
16
ucts, shoes, tea, and handicrafts. 
17
(8) Reports in 2020 indicated that, in recent 
18
years, People’s Republic of China Government au-
19
thorities had organized a labor training and transfer 
20
system on a mass scale. Under this system, hun-
21
dreds of thousands of rural residents of the Tibet 
22
Autonomous Region participated in ‘‘military-style’’ 
23
training, ideological education, and vocational train-
24
ing before being transferred to job postings in the

Tibetan Autonomous Region or elsewhere in China. 
1
The similarity of the Tibet Autonomous Region sys-
2
tem to that in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Re-
3
gion raised fears that coercive practices or rights 
4
abuses may be taking place in the Tibet Autonomous 
5
Region. 
6
(9) Section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 
7
U.S.C. 1307) states that it is illegal to import into 
8
the United States ‘‘goods, wares, articles, and mer-
9
chandise mined, produced, or manufactured wholly 
10
or in part’’ by forced labor. Such merchandise is 
11
subject to exclusion or seizure and may lead to 
12
criminal investigation of the importer. 
13
(10) The policies of the Government of the Peo-
14
ple’s Republic of China are in contravention of inter-
15
national human rights instruments signed by that 
16
government, including— 
17
(A) the Universal Declaration of Human 
18
Rights and the International Covenant on Civil 
19

lic of China has signed but not yet ratified;
