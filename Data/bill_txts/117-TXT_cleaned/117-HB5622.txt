SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) More than 700,000 COVID–19 deaths have 
3
been reported in the United States and many public 
4
health experts believe this to be an undercount of 
5
the actual death toll of the virus. 
6
(2) There are three vaccines that have received 
7
either FDA approval or Emergency Use Authoriza-
8
tion, have undergone rigorous testing, and have been 
9
proven to be safe and highly effective. 
10
(3) These vaccines are free and widely available 
11
in the United States to protect individuals against 
12
COVID–19. 
13
(4) Full vaccination has been proven to reduce 
14
the risk of moderate to severe COVID–19 infection 
15
by five times and hospitalization and death by more 
16
than ten times. 
17
(5) Over 20 percent of Americans eligible to re-
18
ceive the vaccine remain unvaccinated. 
19
(6) COVID–19 hospitalizations of unvaccinated 
20
individuals have cost the U.S. health system an esti-
21
mated $5.7 billion between June 2021 and August 
22
2021. 
23
(7) Some health insurers have proposed or pre-
24
dicted increases in premium costs due to higher 
25

H5622
3 
•HR 5622 IH
health care costs and higher utilization because of 
1
COVID–19-related services. 
2
(8) Evidence shows that the ongoing COVID– 
3
19 pandemic continues to impact Americans’ phys-
4
ical and mental health negatively, has increased sub-
5
stance use and drug overdoses, and has led to hos-
6
pitals rationing care for non-COVID–19-related 
7
care. 
8
(9) The over 20 percent of eligible Americans 
9
who have not been vaccinated against COVID–19 
10
are jeopardizing their own health, the health of their 
11
communities, and the ability of local health systems 
12
to provide comprehensive, high-quality care to every-
13
one who needs it. 
14
(10) The over 20 percent of eligible Americans 
15
who have not been vaccinated against COVID–19 
16
are disproportionately responsible for the continu-
17
ation of community spread of COVID–19 and the 
18
public health emergency in America, as well as its 
19
associated economic consequences.

SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS RELATED TO THE SERIOUS-
3
NESS OF PRESENTING, CREATING, OR DIS-
4
TRIBUTING 
FRAUDULENT 
VACCINATION 
5
CARDS. 
6
It is the sense of Congress that— 
7
(1) any individual falsely representing them-
8
selves as vaccinated against COVID–19 undermines 
9
mitigation efforts, endangers public health, and puts 
10
those around them at increased risk for contracting 
11
COVID–19; 
12
(2) the presentation, sale, purchase, or distribu-
13
tion of counterfeit COVID–19 vaccination cards ap-
14
pearing to be issued by the Centers for Disease Con-
15
trol and Prevention or official vaccination cards 
16
filled out with information falsely indicating that a 
17
person who has not received the COVID–19 vaccina-
18
tion is indeed vaccinated is a serious crime in viola-
19
tion of Federal law; 
20
(3) an individual guilty of the crime of pre-
21
senting or purchasing a fraudulent vaccination card 
22
should, in accordance with law, be subject to a fine 
23
of not less than $5,000; and 
24

H5622
9 
•HR 5622 IH
(4) an individual or organization guilty of the 
1
crime of selling or distributing a fraudulent vaccina-
2
tion card should receive the maximum penalty per-
3
missible under section 1017 of title 18, United 
4
States Code, in accordance with the scope of the 
5
crime.
