•HR 3945 IH
(1) The leadership of the People’s Republic of 
1
China has gone unchallenged in its perverse pursuits 
2
of human rights abuses across decades, including in 
3
its commission of the following: 
4
(A) The Campaign to Suppress Counter-
5
revolutionaries, which killed 712,000 people. 
6
(B) The Chinese Land Reform Movement, 
7
which may have killed up to a million Chinese 
8
citizens. 
9
(C) The Great Chinese Famine, a man- 
10
made disaster that may have killed approxi-
11
mately 30,000,000 people; of that total, it is es-
12
timated that anywhere between 2,000,000 and 
13
3,000,000 people were beaten or tortured to 
14
death. 
15
(D) The crackdown of the pro-democracy 
16
Tiananmen Square protests in 1989, which may 
17
have killed up to 10,000 people. 
18
(2) In recent years, the Chinese Communist 
19
Party (CCP) has continued its barbaric and uncivi-
20
lized rule, including by— 
21
(A) harvesting the organs of up to thou-
22
sands of Chinese citizens every year, many of 
23
whom are Falun Gong practitioners;

(B) coercing over half a million Tibetans 
1
to work in forced labor camps in the first seven 
2
months of 2020, and forcibly sending thousands 
3
of Tibetans to areas within the People’s Repub-
4
lic of China (PRC); and 
5
(C) imprisoning up to 2,000,000 Uyghurs 
6
and ethnic Kazaks and Uzbeks in ‘‘re-edu-
7
cation’’ camps since April 2017, as well as 
8
condoning and facilitating the practice of forced 
9
abortion, sterilization, and other forms of sex-
10
ual abuse on women imprisoned in these camps. 
11
(3) On January 19, 2021, then-Secretary of 
12
State Michael R. Pompeo determined that the CCP 
13
has committed genocide against the predominantly 
14
Muslim Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious mi-
15
nority groups in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous 
16
Region. 
17
(4) Since late 2016, when the CCP escalated its 
18
‘‘Strike Hard Campaign Against Violent Terrorism’’, 
19
Xinjiang province’s criminal justice system has con-
20
victed and sentenced more than 250,000 people to 
21
imprisonment, often without the defendant having 
22
committed a ‘‘genuine’’ offense. 
23
(5) The blatant disregard that the CCP has for 
24
basic human decency runs contrary to the well-func-
25

tioning of an open and civilized society, and respon-
1
sibility for the ongoing genocide in Xinjiang and 
2
human rights abuses throughout China must lie with 
3
the head of state of the People’s Republic of China. 
4
(6) The title of ‘‘President’’ has often been uti-
5
lized to describe the office of the head of state of the 
6
People’s Republic of China, in both the United 
7
States Government and private publications. 
8
(7) Addressing the head of state of the People’s 
9
Republic of China as a ‘‘President’’ grants the incor-
10
rect assumption that the people of the state, via 
11
democratic means, have readily legitimized the lead-
12
er who rules them. 
13
(8) The head of state of the People’s Republic 
14
of China derives all power and authority from the 
15
CCP and is accountable only to them. 
16
(9) The bipartisan U.S.-China Economic and 
17
Security Review Commission stated the following in 
18
the Executive Summary of their 2019 report to Con-
19
gress: ‘‘If there were glimmers of political opening in 
20
China, they have been firmly extinguished. It is for 
21
this reason that this year the Commission made the 
22
decision to start referring to Xi Jinping using the 
23
title by which he derives his authority: General Sec-
24
retary of the Chinese Communist Party. China is

not a democracy, and its citizens have no right to 
1
vote, assemble, or speak freely. Giving General Sec-
2
retary Xi the unearned title of ‘President’ lends a 
3
veneer of democratic legitimacy to the CCP and Xi’s 
4
authoritarian rule.’’. 
5
SEC. 3. UNITED STATES POLICY. 
6
It is the policy of the United States to— 
7
(1) condemn in the strongest possible terms the 
8
horrific human rights abuses being perpetuated and 
9
enabled by the leadership of the CCP; 
10
(2) urge all countries to do the same; 
11
(3) recognize the deep friendship between the 
12
United States and the citizens of the People’s Re-
13
public of China, the first victims of their govern-
14
ment’s cruelty; and 
15
(4) honor the memory of all those who have 
16
died as a result of the callous rule of the CCP.
