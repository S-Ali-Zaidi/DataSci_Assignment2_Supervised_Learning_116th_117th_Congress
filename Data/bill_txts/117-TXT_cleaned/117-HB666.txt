SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Anti-Racism in Public 
2
Health Act of 2021’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress makes the following findings: 
5
(1) For centuries, structural racism, defined by 
6
the National Museum of African American History 
7
and Culture as an ‘‘overarching system of racial bias 
8
across institutions and society,’’ in the United States 
9
has negatively affected communities of color, espe-
10
cially Black, Latinx, Asian American, Pacific Is-
11
lander, and American Indian and Alaska Native peo-
12
ple, to expand and reinforce White supremacy. 
13
(2) Structural racism determines the conditions 
14
in which people are born, grow, work, live, and age 
15
and determine people’s access to quality housing, 
16
education, food, transportation, and political power, 
17
and other social determinants of health. 
18
(3) Structural racism serves as a major barrier 
19
to achieving health equity and eliminating racial and 
20
ethnic inequities in health outcomes that exist at 
21
alarming rates and are determined by a wider set of 
22
forces and systems. 
23
(4) Due to structural racism in the United 
24
States, people of color are more likely to suffer from 
25
chronic health conditions (such as heart disease, dia-
26
18:56 Feb 21, 2021
H666

•HR 666 IH
betes, asthma, hepatitis, and hypertension) and in-
1
fectious diseases (such as HIV/AIDS, and COVID– 
2
19) compared to their White counterparts. 
3
(5) Due to structural racism in maternal health 
4
care in the United States, Black and American In-
5
dian and Alaska Native infants are more than twice 
6
as likely to die than White infants, Black women are 
7
3 to 4 times more likely to die from pregnancy-re-
8
lated causes than White women, and American In-
9
dian and Alaska Native women are 5 times more 
10
likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than 
11
White women. This trend persists even when adjust-
12
ing for income and education. 
13
(6) Due to structural racism in the United 
14
States, Non-Hispanic Black women have the highest 
15
rates for 22 of 25 severe morbidity indicators used 
16
by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention 
17
(CDC). 
18
(7) Due to structural racism in the United 
19
States, people of color comprise a disproportionate 
20
percentage of persons with disabilities in the United 
21
States. 
22
(8) Due to structural racism in the United 
23
States, Black men are up to three and a half times 
24
as likely to be killed by police as White men, and 1 
25
18:56 Feb 21, 2021

•HR 666 IH
in every 1,000 Black men will die as a result of po-
1
lice violence. Policing has adverse effects on mental 
2
health in Black communities. 
3
(9) Due to the confluence of structural racism 
4
and factors such as gender, class, and sexual ori-
5
entation or gender identity, commonly referred to as 
6
intersectionality, Black and Latinx transgender 
7
women are more likely to die due to violence and 
8
homicide than their White counterparts. 
9
(10) Due to structural racism, inequitable ac-
10
cess to quality health care and longterm services and 
11
supports also disproportionately burdens commu-
12
nities of color; people of color and immigrants are 
13
less likely to be insured and are more likely to live 
14
in medically underserved areas. 
15
(11) Due to structural racism, older adults of 
16
color are also more likely to be admitted to nursing 
17
homes and assisted living facilities and to reside in 
18
those of poor quality, and when older adults of color 
19
do receive home and community based services, Med-
20
icaid spends less money on their services and they 
21
are more likely to be hospitalized than older White 
22
adults. 
23
(12) In addition, the Federal Government’s fail-
24
ure to honor the unique political status of American 
25
18:56 Feb 21, 2021

5 
•HR 666 IH
Indian and Alaska Native people, to respect the in-
1
herent sovereignty of Tribal Nations, and to uphold 
2
its trust and treaty obligations to Tribal Nations 
3
and American Indian and Alaska Native people, is 
4
an ongoing and unjust manifestation of centuries of 
5
oppression, with the consequence of adverse health 
6
outcomes for Native peoples. 
7
(13) The COVID–19 pandemic has exposed the 
8
devastating impact of structural racism on the 
9
United States ability to ensure equitable health out-
10
comes for people of color, and made these commu-
11
nities more likely to suffer from severe outcomes due 
12
to the coronavirus infection. 
13
(14) Racial and ethnic inequity in public health 
14
is a result of systematic, personally mediated, and 
15
internalized racism and racist public and private 
16
policies and practices, and dismantling structural 
17
racism is integral to addressing public health.
