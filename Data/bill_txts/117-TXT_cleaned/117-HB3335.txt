(a) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds the following:

•HR 3335 IH
(1) Greyhounds have existed for thousands of 
1
years and are the only canines mentioned by name 
2
in the Bible. 
3
(2) Commercial greyhound racing was first le-
4
galized in Florida in 1931. 
5
(3) Modern racetracks require internet-based 
6
wire communications to process bets and wagers, 
7
calculate odds, broadcast races, announce results, 
8
and pay winnings to gamblers. 
9
(4) Public records reveal that some greyhounds 
10
used for live commercial racing suffer serious inju-
11
ries including broken backs, broken necks, head 
12
trauma, paralysis, seizures, and electrocution. 
13
(5) State records show that some racing grey-
14
hounds test positive for drugs including cocaine, am-
15
phetamines, barbituates, opiods, and steroids. 
16
(6) State investigatory files document that rac-
17
ing greyhounds are kept confined for 20-23 hours a 
18
day in stacked, metal cages, typically with little op-
19
portunity to socialize with other dogs. 
20
(7) Many small animals, including but not lim-
21
ited to rabbits and hares, are bought, sold, delivered, 
22
transported, and received in interstate and foreign 
23
commerce for use as live bait in the training of rac-
24
ing greyhounds and in open field coursing.

(8) Typically, animals used in the live lure 
1
training of greyhounds may be dragged on ropes, 
2
hung from a horizontal pole which rotates around a 
3
training track or simply set loose to be chased and 
4
mauled. Alive or dead, helpless bait animals may be 
5
used repeatedly until they are torn apart. 
6
(9) Live lure training is prohibited in more 
7
than a dozen States, but there is no Federal statute. 
8
In the late 1970’s, the National Greyhound Associa-
9
tion, a membership organization representing breed-
10
ers, trainers and other industry participants, an-
11
nounced a policy against live lure training in order 
12
to convince then-Senators Birch Bayh and Robert 
13
Dole to withdraw their proposed legislation. 
14
(10) Open field coursing preceded commercial 
15
dog racing and is an activity in which greyhounds or 
16
other sighthounds are released to pursue and kill 
17
bait animals, often in a fenced area. Greyhounds 
18
often collide and suffer injuries in the chase. 
19
(11) Dog owners travel from multiple States 
20
and countries to compete and win prizes and some-
21
times gamble on open field coursing events. 
22
(12) As with commercial greyhound racing, 
23
internet sites are used to promote coursing tour-
24
naments and post results to a worldwide audience.

(13) The National Field Coursing Association is 
1
the umbrella group for coursing clubs nationwide 
2
and had 12 clubs in California as of 2006. 
3
(14) Open field coursing is illegal in as many 
4
as 12 States. 
5
(15) Open field coursing was prohibited as a 
6
blood sport in Scotland in 2002 and in the United 
7
Kingdom in 2004. 
8
(16) Twenty-five years ago, there were 60 grey-
9
hound tracks in the United States. Once a voter-ap-
10
proved ballot measure prohibiting greyhound racing 
11
takes full effect in Florida in 2020 and the vol-
12
untary shut down of Southland Park in Arkansas 
13
takes place as of 2022, no more than 5 tracks will 
14
remain throughout the country. 
15
(17) According to the State of Florida, track 
16
owners had been collectively losing more than $30 
17
million annually because of sagging attendance and 
18
decreased wagering. According to a State-commis-
19
sioned report, the State spent more money regu-
20
lating the industry in its national hub than it gen-
21
erated in tax revenue. 
22
(18) As of December 31, 2022, live commercial 
23
dog racing will be illegal in 41 States. This dying in-

dustry will remain legal and operational in no more

than 4 States.

(b) POLICY.—It is the policy of the Congress in this 
3
chapter to prohibit the use of wire communications for the 
4
purpose of gambling on live, commercial greyhound racing 
5
and open field coursing events and to prohibit the trans-
6
port of animals including but not limited to greyhounds, 
7
rabbits, and hares in interstate and foreign commerce in 
8
furtherance of these activities.

15
wire communications or to permit the transport of animals 
16
for the purpose of conducting or furthering commercial 
17
dog racing, live lure training or field coursing.’’.
