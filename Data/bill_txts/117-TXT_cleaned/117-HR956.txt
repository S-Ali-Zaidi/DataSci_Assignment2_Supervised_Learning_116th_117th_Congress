ritory to be a part of Russia;

•HRES 956 IH 
Whereas the decision to recognize the self-proclaimed 
Luhansk People’s Republic and Donetsk People’s Repub-
lic as independent and order Russian troops into that ter-
ritory was not only in violation of international law, 
Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and the 
Minsk agreements, but also tantamount to a declaration

and reaffirmed an ‘‘iron-clad’’ commitment to Article 5; 
Whereas the European Commission, France, Germany, Italy, 
the United Kingdom, and Canada joined with the United 
States, committed to coordinated economic sanctions, in-
cluding severe restrictions, against Russia’s Central Bank 
and full blocking sanctions against Vladimir Putin; 
Whereas United States leadership is integral to nations 
around the world in condemning and imposing costs on 
the Russian Federation for its illegal, full-scale, renewed 
invasion; 
Whereas Russian forces have targeted civilians and have com-
mitted war crimes and crimes against humanity; 
Whereas, in the days since the renewed full-scale invasion 
began, Russian citizens have taken to the streets in cities 
and towns across Russia to protest Putin’s illegitimate 
and destructive war waged against a peaceful and sov-
ereign Ukraine; and
