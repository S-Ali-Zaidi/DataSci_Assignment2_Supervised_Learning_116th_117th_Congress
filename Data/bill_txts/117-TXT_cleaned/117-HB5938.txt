A BILL 
To direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to conduct a 
review on opioid overdose deaths among veterans, and 
for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Veterans Heroin Over-
4
dose Prevention Examination Act’’ or the ‘‘Veterans 
5
HOPE Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
7
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
8
(1) New research shows that a dramatic rise in 
9
opioid overdose deaths among veterans in recent 
10

years has happened increasingly among veterans 
1
dying from heroin and synthetic opioids. 
2
(2) Furthermore, patients of the Veterans 
3
Health Administration of the Department of Vet-
4
erans Affairs are seven more times likely to suffer 
5
from an opioid use disorder than commercially in-
6
sured patients. 
7
(3) Using records of the Veterans Health Ad-
8
ministration linked to National Death Index data, 
9
the veterans’ rate of overdose deaths from all opioids 
10
increased by 65 percent from 2010 to 2016, a rate 
11
change that includes adjustments for demographic 
12
changes in the veteran population over time. 
13
(4) Furthermore, among all opioid overdose de-
14
cedents, prescription opioid receipt within three 
15
months before death declined from 54 percent in 
16
2010 to 26 percent in 2016, yet veteran overdoses 
17
resulting in death from heroin, synthetic opioids 
18
such as fentanyl, and nonprescription opioids still 
19
occurred. 
20
(5) In fact, between 2010 and 2016, the vet-
21
eran death rate from heroin or from taking multiple 
22
opioids almost quintupled and the death rate from 
23
synthetic opioids such as fentanyl increased by more 
24
than five-fold.

•HR 5938 IH
(6) Trends would suggest that, while the aggre-
1
gate rise in opioid overdose deaths among veterans 
2
parallel those seen in the general population, the in-
3
crease occurred mainly because of a rise in deaths 
4
from nonprescribed sources such as heroin, fentanyl, 
5
other powerful synthetic opioids, or multiple opioids 
6
in concurrent use. 
7
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
8
gress that further veterans overdose prevention efforts and 
9
research should extend beyond patients actively receiving 
10
opioid prescriptions.
