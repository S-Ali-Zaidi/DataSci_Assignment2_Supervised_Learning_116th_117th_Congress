•HR 5510 IH
(1) many types of health care professionals in-
1
cluding physicians, technicians, nurses, physician as-
2
sistants, and other allied practitioners are engaged 
3
in providing services in health care settings, and all 
4
of these individuals play an important and distinct 
5
role in the health care delivery system; 
6
(2) the exchange of information between pa-
7
tients and their health care professionals is critical 
8
to helping patients understand their health care 
9
choices; 
10
(3) consumers are often unaware of the dif-
11
ferences in, and seek more information about, the 
12
qualifications, training, and education of their health 
13
care professionals; 
14
(4) evidence exists of patient confusion result-
15
ing from ambiguous health care nomenclature and 
16
related advertisements and marketing products; and 
17
(5) nationwide surveys conducted in 2008 and 
18
2010 revealed the depth of confusion regarding the 
19
education, skills, and training of health care profes-
20
sionals and indicated strong support for increasing 
21
clarity in the advertising and marketing claims of 
22
health care professionals.
