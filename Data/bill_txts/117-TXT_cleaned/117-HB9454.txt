SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
5
Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) The future strength of the Nation’s democ-
7
racy, as well as the Nation’s economy, is dependent 
8
upon the investments made in children and youth 
9
today. 
10
(2) Evidence demonstrates that effective part-
11
nerships among schools and communities increase 
12
student achievement by addressing the academic 
13
needs of students as well as the challenges the stu-
14
dents face outside the classroom. For example: 
15
(A) Chicago public schools lead one of the 
16
Nation’s largest community school initiatives 
17
and found that students in grades 9 through 12 
18
who attend a community school have 61 percent 
19
21:14 Dec 12, 2022

•HR 9454 IH
fewer school-day absences than their non-com-
1
munity school counterparts. When compared to 
2
non-community school counterparts— 
3
(i) students in grades 9 through 12 
4
were found to have more positive edu-
5
cational experiences; 
6
(ii) students in grades 4 through 8 
7
had higher emotional health scores on the 
8
survey; and 
9
(iii) students in kindergarten through 
10
grade 3 had 53 percent fewer suspensions 
11
and 55 percent fewer misconducts. 
12
(B) In a 7-year study of 200 Chicago pub-
13
lic schools, sociologist Anthony Bryk found that 
14
in schools where grassroots organizations forge 
15
strong connections with their schools, trust lev-
16
els and parent involvement are greater. 
17
(C) United Way of Salt Lake’s Promise 
18
Partnership, an initiative across multiple school 
19
districts in the Salt Lake, Utah area, has 
20
helped increase student achievement and grad-
21
uation rates. Since the program’s launch in 
22
2014, 5 out of the 8 targeted indicators have 
23
improved, even in light of the challenges posed 
24
by COVID–19. Kindergarten readiness in 
25

numeracy increased by 3 percent, 8th grade 
1
math proficiency improved by 8 percent, high 
2
school graduation rose by 5 percent, postsec-
3
ondary readiness grew by 4 percent, and post-
4
secondary completion increased by 5 percent. 
5
To overcome pandemic-related learning loss in 
6
literacy, Promise Partnership school Mill Creek 
7
Elementary collaborated with 80 volunteers 
8
from organizations including Goldman Sachs 
9
and Dominion Energy to offer tutoring support 
10
through the iReady program. By the end of the 
11
2020–2021 school year, the number of 3rd 
12
grade students participating in the program 
13
testing at or above grade level tripled. 
14
(D) From 2015 to 2018, the New York 
15
City Community School Initiative improved at-
16
tendance, on-time grade progression, and grad-
17
uation rates across elementary and secondary 
18
students. During the same 3-year period, this 
19
initiative led to a reduction in disciplinary inci-
20
dents for elementary and middle school stu-
21
dents while also improving math achievement 
22
scores. Middle school students attending com-
23
munity schools scored 4.2 percentage points 
24
higher on math exams compared their peers at 
25

non-community schools, and high school stu-
1
dents attending community schools earned 12 
2
percent more credits per academic year than 
3
students enrolled at non-community schools. 
4
(E) In Wisconsin, where formal partner-
5
ships with community agencies are required for 
6
grant programs, non-traditional partners have 
7
proven to be instrumental for smaller commu-
8
nities to enrich after school programs. Those 
9
partners have included— 
10
(i) local trucking companies; 
11
(ii) statewide nonprofit organizations, 
12
such as The Grange; 
13
(iii) Farm Bureau; 
14
(iv) small retailers; and 
15
(v) retirees. 
16
(F) The Union City Public Schools school 
17
district in New Jersey proves that by breaking 
18
down institutional ‘‘silos’’ and creating deep 
19
partnerships, through collaboration and munic-
20
ipal involvement, schools can be vibrant places 
21
of hope despite poverty, unemployment, and 
22
lack of affordable housing.

promote school readiness among children while 
1
also providing parents with educational services, 
2
community resources, and leadership opportuni-
3
ties. A 2017 report indicates that with the as-
4
sistance of English language proficiency sup-
5
ports, 70 percent of Redwood City community 
6
school parents were able to participate in their 
7
children’s school meetings, attend professional 
8
development programs, and engage in family-to- 
9
family education and outreach. Over the course 
10
of a 3-year period, students whose parents par-
11
ticipated in family engagement programs had a 
12
40 percent increase in attendance and were 
13
more likely to see improvement in their math 
14
and English language test scores. 
15
(H) By meeting the comprehensive needs 
16
of students, Communities In Schools, a national 
17
dropout prevention organization, found that 99 
18
percent of participating students stayed in 
19
school, 78 percent of participating students met 
20
or made progress toward their attendance goals, 
21
90 percent met or made progress toward their 
22
behavior goals, and 88 percent met or made 
23
progress toward their academic improvement 
24
goals.

(3) In adopting the Every Student Succeeds 
1
Act (Public Law 114–95), Congress recognized com-
2
munity schools as a strategy to significantly improve 
3
the coordination and integration, accessibility, and 
4
effectiveness of services for children and families, 
5
particularly for children attending high-poverty 
6
schools, including high-poverty rural schools. Con-
7
gress recognized community schools as an effective 
8
use of funds for school districts in the American 
9
Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117–2). 
10
(4) Approximately 86 percent of 9th graders 
11
graduate from high school within 4 years. Of stu-
12
dents who graduate from high school, 63 percent en-
13
roll in a 2- or 4-year college in the fall after com-
14
pleting high school. Only about half (64 percent) of 
15
first-time, full-time college freshmen seeking a 4- 
16
year degree receive a bachelor’s degree within 6 
17
years or less. 
18
(5) Over the past 4 decades, the United States 
19
has slipped from being first in the world in high 
20
school and college graduation rates to 21st and 
21
14th, respectively, putting the Nation at a growing 
22
competitive disadvantage with other countries.

sults indicate that between 2020 and 2022, students 
1
experienced a 5-percent drop in reading scores, the 
2
largest drop since 1990, and a 7-percent decrease, 
3
the first ever drop, in math scores. Black student 
4
scores in math fell by 13 percent as compared to a 
5
5-percent decrease by their White peers, thus ex-
6
panding the achievement gap from 25 percentage 
7
points to 33 percent percentage points in just 2 
8
years. 
9
(7) In a study conducted by Hanover Research, 
10
data showed that quality partnerships between 
11
schools and their communities can result in im-
12
proved attendance, motivation, conduct, and aca-
13
demic achievement. Community-level strategies like 
14
focusing on parental involvement, community build-
15
ing, and cultural competence were shown to con-
16
tribute to decreases in the achievement gap between 
17
lower- and upper-income students. 
18
(8) Research from the Government Account-
19
ability Office found that students who change 
20
schools less frequently are more likely to perform at 
21
grade level and less likely to repeat a grade than 
22
their less stable peers.

versity, school ‘‘connectedness’’ is identified as im-
1
portant to student learning, achievement, and well- 
2
being. When students feel a sense of connection with 
3
the larger world and community institutions, they 
4
are more engaged in instructional activities and ex-
5
press greater commitment to school. 
6
(10) It has been learned from successful experi-
7
ences that hundreds of thousands of arts, cultural, 
8
service, sports, college, and other youth organiza-
9
tions, as well as civic and faith-based groups, want 
10
to partner with schools and educators to reinforce 
11
learning, but far too often, neither the school nor 
12
the community know how to effectively connect with 
13
each other. 
14
(11) In order for the United States to compete 
15
in a global economy, the co-partnering efforts of gov-
16
ernment, social services, business, arts, home, com-
17
munity-based organizations, and philanthropy need 
18
to concentrate their efforts where they are most 
19
needed: in our schools. 
20
(12) Research from Johns Hopkins University 
21
has shown that access to summer learning opportu-
22
nities leads to significant student learning gains not 
23
experienced by students who cannot access summer 
24
learning opportunities.

(13) A 2011 study conducted by the RAND 
1
Corporation found that students who attend summer 
2
learning programs, particularly those featuring indi-
3
vidualized instruction, parental involvement, and 
4
small class sizes, experience clear benefits in over-
5
coming the achievement gap between low- and 
6
upper-income students. 
7
(14) Research from the Community School 
8
Partnership found that community schools see a re-
9
turn of $7.11 for every dollar of investment in com-
10
munity schools coordinators. 
11
(15) A 2017 report from the Learning Policy 
12
Institute found that teacher retention has a direct 
13
impact on student learning and academic perform-
14
ance. Implementing strategies such as teacher resi-
15
dency programs, high-quality mentoring, grow your 
16
own models, principal training and State leadership 
17
academies can lead to higher rates of educator re-
18
tention and career satisfaction. For example, Cali-
19
fornia’s Paraprofessional Teacher Training Program 
20
has prepared more than 2,200 paraprofessionals to 
21
become fully certified teachers with 92 percent of 
22
graduates obtaining teaching positions in California 
23
public schools.

(16) According to the National Center for Edu-
1

3
cant teaching position in the spring of 2022. Of 
4
those schools with reported unfilled teaching posi-
