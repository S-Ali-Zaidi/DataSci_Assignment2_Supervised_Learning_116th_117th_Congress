SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Knowing the Efficiency

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
5
Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) On January 21, 2020, the United States 
7
confirmed the Nation’s first case of the 2019 novel 
8
coronavirus (which presents as the disease COVID– 
9
19). 
10
(2) On January 31, 2020, the Secretary of 
11
Health and Human Services (in this Act referred to 
12
as the ‘‘Secretary’’) declared a public health emer-
13
gency in response to COVID–19. 
14
(3) By March, the disease reached the pan-
15
demic level according to the World Health Organiza-
16
tion, and the President proclaimed the COVID–19 
17
outbreak in the United States to constitute a na-
18
tional emergency. 
19
(4) This emergency declaration authorizes the 
20
Secretary ‘‘to temporarily waive or modify certain 
21
requirements of the Medicare, Medicaid, and State 
22
Children’s Health Insurance programs and of the 
23
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 
24
Privacy Rule throughout the duration of the public

health emergency declared in response to the 
1
COVID–19 outbreak’’. 
2
(5) Under this authority, the Secretary, and the 
3
Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Med-
4
icaid Services (in this Act referred to as the ‘‘Ad-
5
ministrator’’) acting under the Secretary’s authority, 
6
issued numerous rules, regulations, and waivers ena-
7
bling the expansion of telehealth services during the 
8
public health emergency. 
9
(6) Telehealth services play a critical role in en-
10
hancing access to care for patients while simulta-
11
neously reducing the risk of exposure to the corona-
12
virus for both patients and providers. 
13
(7) The Administrator expanded access to tele-
14
health services under the public health emergency to 
15
all Medicare beneficiaries (including clinician-pro-
16
vided services to new and established patients). 
17
(8) On April 23, 2020, the Administrator re-
18
leased a telehealth toolkit to assist States in expand-
19
ing the use of telehealth through Medicaid and 
20
CHIP. 
21
(9) Expanded telehealth options are valuable 
22
for all Americans during this public health crisis, 
23
but especially for high-risk patients and rural Ameri-
24
cans who already have difficulty accessing care.
