RESOLUTION 
Supporting the designation of July 21, 2021, as 
‘‘Glioblastoma Awareness Day’’. 
Whereas approximately 13,000 new cases of glioblastoma will 
be diagnosed in the United States in 2021; 
Whereas glioblastoma is— 
(1) the most common malignant, cancerous brain 
tumor, accounting for approximately half of all primary 
malignant brain tumors; and 
(2) the most aggressive, complex, difficult to treat, 
and deadly type of brain tumor; 
Whereas it is estimated that more than 10,000 individuals in 
the United States will succumb to glioblastoma every 
year;

Whereas the 5-year survival rate for glioblastoma patients is 
only 7.2 percent and the median length of survival for 
glioblastoma patients is only 8 months; 
Whereas glioblastoma is described as a disease that affects 
the ‘‘essence of self’’, as the treatment and removal of 
glioblastoma presents significant challenges due to the 
uniquely complex and fragile nature of the brain, the pri-
mary organ in the human body that controls not only 
cognitive ability but also the actions of every organ and 
limb; 
Whereas relative to other types of cancers, brain cancer 
has— 
(1) the highest per-patient initial cost of care, with 
an annualized mean net cost of care approaching 
$150,000; and 
(2) the highest annualized mean net costs for last- 
year-of-life care, with a cost of between $135,000 and 
$210,000 per patient, depending on the age and gender 
of a patient; 
Whereas although research advances may fuel the develop-
ment of new treatments for glioblastoma, challenging ob-
stacles to accelerating progress toward new treatments 
for glioblastoma remain and there are no screening or 
early detection methods; 
Whereas although glioblastoma was first described in medical 
and scientific literature in the 1920s, and despite its dev-
astating prognosis, only 4 drugs and 1 medical device 
have been approved by the Food and Drug Administra-
tion to treat glioblastoma since the 1920s and the mor-
tality rates associated with glioblastoma have changed lit-
tle during the past 30 years;

•HRES 391 IH 
Whereas as a promising first step since the first Glioblastoma 
Awareness Day, the National Cancer Institute established 
the Glioblastoma Therapeutics Network (referred to in 
this preamble as ‘‘GTN’’) in 2020, as part of a national 
infrastructure to enhance and support the discovery and 
development of glioblastoma therapies, with an initial 
$6,000,000 available for multi-institutional GTN teams 
to drive therapeutic agents through pre-clinical studies 
and early-phase clinical trials necessary to rapidly evalu-
ate potential treatments to advance toward cures and im-
proved quality of life; and 
Whereas there is a need for greater public awareness of glio-
blastoma, including awareness of both— 
(1) the urgent unmet medical needs of glioblastoma 
patients; and 
(2) the opportunities for research and treatment ad-
vances for glioblastoma: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the designation of ‘‘Glioblastoma 
2
Awareness Day’’; 
3
(2) encourages increased public awareness of 
4
glioblastoma; 
5
(3) honors the individuals who have lost their 
6
lives to glioblastoma, a devastating disease, or are 
7
currently living with it; 
8
(4) supports efforts to develop better treat-
9
ments for glioblastoma that will improve the long- 
10
term prognosis and quality of life of individuals di-
11
agnosed with the disease;

(5) expresses its support for the individuals who 
1
are battling brain tumors, as well as the families, 
2
friends, and caregivers of those individuals; 
3
(6) urges a collaborative approach to brain 
4
tumor research, which is a promising means of ad-
5
vancing the understanding and treatment of glio-
6
blastoma; and 
7
(7) encourages continued Federal investments

in glioblastoma research and treatments, including 
9
through the Glioblastoma Therapeutics Network and 
10
other existing brain tumor research resources.
