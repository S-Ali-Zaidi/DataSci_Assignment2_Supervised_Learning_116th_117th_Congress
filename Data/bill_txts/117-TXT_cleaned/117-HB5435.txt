SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The brain and central nervous system make 
3
up the body’s most complex organ system. 
4
(2) Nearly one in five adults in the United 
5
States (more than 50 million) live with a mental ill-
6
ness, disproportionately impacting women, people re-
7
porting two or more races, and individuals under age 
8
fifty. 
9
(3) Neuropsychiatric disorders are the leading 
10
cause of disability in the Nation, making up 18.7 
11
percent of years lost to disability and premature 
12
death. 
13
(4) Brain disorders, injuries, and diseases are 
14
estimated to cost the United States more than $1.5 
15
trillion per year. 
16
(5) Mental health and substance use disorder 
17
treatment spending is expected to total $280.5 bil-
18

19
(6) The SARS–CoV–2 virus can cause serious 
20
psychiatric and neurologic effects and the COVID–

19 pandemic has exacerbated the burden of brain 
22
and central nervous system conditions. 
23
(7) Products targeting the brain and central 
24
nervous system, including those conditions with few 
25
or no approved treatments, take longer to develop
