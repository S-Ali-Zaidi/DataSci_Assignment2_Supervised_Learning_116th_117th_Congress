ican civic society; 
Whereas USCIS data indicate that the processing times for 
immigrations benefits have increased substantially over

creased by over 100 percent while its overall case volume

prosperity; 
Whereas the Federal Government has acknowledged to Con-
gress that USCIS policies have contributed to the growth 
in delayed cases;

with limited notice or transparency, increasing uncer-
tainty and inefficiency throughout our legal immigration 
system; 
Whereas individuals and employers have received from 
USCIS requests for additional information or have been 
required to undergo additional procedures that are un-
necessary, duplicative, and further delay adjudications; 
Whereas unnecessary and duplicative procedures will not ad-
vance the purpose of preventing fraud; and 
Whereas individuals and employers, as well as members of 
Congress, are frequently unable to obtain timely USCIS
