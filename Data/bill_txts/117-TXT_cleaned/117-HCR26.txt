nonconforming people around the world, and to recognize 
the bravery it takes to live openly and authentically; 
Whereas International Transgender Day of Visibility is also 
a time to raise awareness of the discrimination and vio-
lence that the transgender community still faces, which 
make it difficult and even unsafe for many transgender 
people to be visible; 
Whereas the transgender community has suffered dispropor-
tionately in many ways, including by workplace and edu-
cational discrimination and being subject to violence, and 
these forms of oppression are exacerbated for transgen-
der people of color, people with limited resources, immi-
grants, and people living with disabilities; 
Whereas the transgender community has made it clear that 
it will not be erased and must be accorded all of the 
rights and opportunities made available to all; 
Whereas transgender, nonbinary, and gender nonconforming 
people continue to bravely tell their stories and push for 
full equity under the law; 
Whereas the civil rights struggle has been strengthened and 
inspired by the leadership of the transgender community; 
Whereas six transgender candidates were elected to State of-
fice in the 2020 general election, increasing to seven the 
total number of transgender-elected officials in State leg-
islatures; 
Whereas voters in the State of Delaware elected the Nation’s 
first openly transgender State senator; 
Whereas the first openly transgender Federal official was 
confirmed by the United States Senate and is the highest 
ranking openly transgender Federal Government official 
in United States history;
