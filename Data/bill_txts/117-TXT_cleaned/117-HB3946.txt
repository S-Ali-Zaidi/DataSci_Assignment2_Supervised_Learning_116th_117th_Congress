Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Pell Grant Preserva-
4
tion and Expansion Act of 2021’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) The United States needs individuals with 
8
the knowledge, skills, and abilities that enable them 
9
to thrive as educated citizens in society and success-
10
fully participate in an interconnected economy. 
11
(2) Investments in higher education through 
12
student aid such as the Federal Pell Grant program 
13
under section 401 of the Higher Education Act of 
14
1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070a) help students and families 
15
reach, afford, and complete education and training 
16
opportunities beyond high school. 
17
(3) The Federal Pell Grant program is the larg-
18
est source of federally funded grant aid for postsec-
19
ondary education. 
20
(4) The Federal Pell Grant program allows mil-
21
lions of people of the United States to attend college 
22
and is especially vital for students of color. Three in 
23
5 African American undergraduate students, and 
24

H3946

•HR 3946 IH
one-half of all Latino undergraduate students, rely 
1
on the Federal Pell Grant program. 
2
(5) The Federal Pell Grant program should 
3
continue to be a reliable source of funding for aspir-
4
ing students, their families, and future generations 
5
that they can count on to be there for them when 
6
they seek higher education. 
7
(6) To stabilize Federal Pell Grant funding and 
8
ensure the grant will continue to serve millions of 
9
students now and in the future, the program should 
10
become a fully mandatory program that grows with 
11
inflation. 
12
(7) Restoring prior eligibility cuts and expand-
13
ing access to underserved students will give millions 
14
of students and families the critical student aid sup-
15
port they need and deserve.
