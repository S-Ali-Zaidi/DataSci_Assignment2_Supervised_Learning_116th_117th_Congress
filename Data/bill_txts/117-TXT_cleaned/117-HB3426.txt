A BILL 
To authorize the establishment of a Technology Partnership 
among democratic countries, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Democracy Technology 
4
Partnership Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) The 21st century will increasingly be de-
8
fined by economic competition rooted in techno-
9
logical advances. Leaders in adopting emerging tech-

nologies, such as artificial intelligence, quantum 
1
computing, biotechnology, and next-generation tele-
2
communications, and those who shape the use of 
3
such technologies, will garner economic, military, 
4
and political strength for decades. 
5
(2) These technologies offer opportunities for 
6
the empowerment of citizens, but also and challenges 
7
to basic norms of democratic governance and inter-
8
nationally recognized human rights. The collection 
9
and analysis of data from individuals allows govern-
10
ments to know more about their residents’ behaviors, 
11
preferences, interests, and activities than was pos-
12
sible years ago. The concentration of this data in 
13
key technologies, such as smart phones, search data-
14
bases, and facial recognition databases, along with 
15
the sharing of data among governments, creates 
16
pressing concerns about individuals’ scope to exer-
17
cise their fundamental political and social rights. 
18
(3) This challenge arises as the integrity and 
19
efficacy of post-World War II international institu-
20
tions are increasingly challenged. New approaches to 
21
multilateral cooperation and arrangements are need-
22
ed to tackle the challenges ahead to ensure that the 
23
United States continues to lead in critical tech-
24
nologies.

•HR 3426 IH
(4) As information and communications tech-
1
nologies have matured and increasingly mediate 
2
large swathes of social, political and economic activ-
3
ity, it is incumbent on democratic governments to 
4
address the ways in which these technologies have 
5
undermined democratic values, consumer protec-
6
tions, and social cohesion. Moreover, as authori-
7
tarian regimes increasingly shape and deploy tech-
8
nologies to bolster repression, stifle free expression, 
9
and interfere with free and fair elections in other 
10
countries, the world’s advanced democracies will 
11
need to shape technology standards so that emerging 
12
and critical technologies reflect democratic values, 
13
including freedom of expression and privacy. 
14
(5) Technological leadership by the world’s 
15
major liberal-democratic nations collectively will be 
16
essential to safeguarding democratic institutions, 
17
norms, and values, and contributing to global peace 
18
and prosperity, especially as authoritarian govern-
19
ments seek to promote closed information systems 
20
and technology that is not interoperable, often 
21
through trade and investment practices that are in-
22
compatible with global norms. A unified approach by 
23
like-minded nations is needed to counteract growing

investments in, and deployments of, emerging tech-
1
nologies by authoritarian powers. 
2
(6) In addition to the development of emerging 
3
technologies, democratic nations must lead in shap-
4
ing expectations for the responsible use of such tech-
5
nologies and push back against laissez faire ap-
6
proaches and authoritarian interests on internet gov-
7
ernance advanced in multilateral forums by— 
8
(A) advocating against efforts to crim-
9
inalize or limit political dissent and freedom of 
10
speech online, such as those spearheaded by the 
11
Russian Federation, which seek to undermine 
12
the 
Council 
of 
Europe’s 
Convention 
on 
13
Cybercrime, done at Budapest November 23, 
14
2001, in favor of a statist alternative; and 
15
(B) prioritizing protections for elections, 
16
and other processes essential for healthy democ-
17
racies, from cyber-attack. 
18
(7) The world’s leading democracies must also 
19
confront new challenges to their market-driven eco-
20
nomic systems to ensure their continued leadership 
21
in technology and innovation. The People’s Republic 
22
of China (referred to in this Act as the ‘‘PRC’’) is 
23
pursuing an industrial policy to achieve dominance 
24
in key technologies, including 5G, artificial intel-

(8) The PRC seeks to use technological superi-
4
ority for national security, military-civil fusion, and 
5
economic gains, according to its strategic plans, in-
6
cluding— 
7
(A) the Made in China 2025 strategy; 
8
(B) the Five-Year Plan for Standardiza-
9
tion and China Standards 2035; 
10
(C) the 2006 Medium-to-Long Term S&T 
11
Plan; 
12
(D) the 2010 State Council Decision on 
13
Accelerating the Development of Strategic 
14
Emerging Industries; and 
15
(E) the 13th Five-Year Plan for the Devel-
16
opment of Strategic Emerging Industries. 
17
(9) The PRC seeks to advance in areas in 
18
which democratic countries currently have a techno-
19
logical advantage and move ahead in emerging tech-
20
nologies where China seeks a unique opportunity to 
21
overtake such countries. 
22
(10) For many years, the PRC has pursued in-
23

•HR 3426 IH
(A) heavily subsidizing Chinese companies,

restricting

forced technology transfers, and using both licit 
3
and illicit means to access research and devel-
4

7
(B) providing significant government fund-
8

ness; 
11
(C) seeking to ensure global adoption of 
12
Chinese technologies, and the success of Chi-
13

17
through initiatives such as the Belt and Road 
18
Initiative, which includes the Digital Silk Road 
19
and the Health Silk Road, as well as the Smart 
20

21
the use of Chinese exports by offering far

cheaper rates and bundling these deals into 
23
larger development and aid packages;

4
nical experts; and 
5
(E) leveraging the international standard 
6
setting bodies to advance the vision of the PRC 
7
regarding standards and technologies. 
8
(11) As a result of these practices in support of 
9
Chinese companies, the PRC is increasing its influ-
10
ence in AI, 5G, and a wide range of other science 
11
and technology disciplines that constitute long-term 
12
economic and security threats to the United States, 
13
its allies, and like-minded partners. According to 
14
market research firm Dell’Oro Group, Huawei’s 
15
share of worldwide telecommunications revenue 
16
equipment grew from 20 percent in 2014 to 31 per-
17
cent in 2020. 
18
(12) While the United States semiconductor in-
19
dustry is the worldwide industry leader with approxi-
20
mately 50 percent of global market share and sales 
21
of $193,000,000,000 in 2019, the situation may be 
22
changing. In 2019, all 6 of the new semiconductor 
23
fabrication plants that opened worldwide were lo-
24
cated outside of the United States, with 4 of these

plants built in China. The Government of the PRC 
1
plans to spend $150,000,000,000 on its computer 
2
chip industry during the next 10 years. 
3
(13) The PRC uses technologies, such as AI, 
4
facial recognition, and biometrics, to increase control 
5
over its population, facilitating mass surveillance, 
6
scalable censorship, and technology-enabled social 
7
control, including against ethnic and religious mi-
8
norities 
including 
Tibetans, 
Uyghurs, 
ethnic 
9
Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and members of other Muslim mi-
10
nority groups. 
11
(14) The PRC uses its economic power to co-
12
erce and censor companies, individuals and coun-
13
tries. 
14
(15) In the past decade, the Government of the 
15
PRC— 
16
(A) blocked exports of rare earth elements 
17
to Japan; 
18
(B) threatened to curtail domestic sales of 
19
German cars; 
20
(C) cut off tourism to South Korea; 
21
(D) restricted banana imports from the 
22
Philippines; and 
23
(E) imposed large tariffs on Australian 
24
barley exports.

(16) The Government of the PRC— 
1
(A) has banned United States technology 
2
companies, including Facebook, Google, and 
3
Twitter; 
4
(B) has pressured movie studios based in 
5
the United States to alter content in movies 
6
that it deemed objectionable; and 
7
(C) has retaliated against a range of 
8
American companies for actual or perceived 
9
support for a range of political positions, in-
10
cluding recognizing territorial claims of coun-
11
tries in border disputes with China, recognizing 
12
Tibet, and more. 
13
(17) Third countries have become particular 
14
targets of Chinese investments in technology. These 
15
third country investments provide access to innova-
16
tion, data that allows Chinese companies to refine 
17
their own systems, and influence over the policies of 
18
these governments. The terms on which Chinese in-
19
vestments are made often are attractive in the short- 
20
term but create conditions for Chinese ownership of, 
21
or influence over, major industries in those coun-
22
tries. 
23
(18) After decades of being the world leader in 
24
key technologies, the United States is at risk of fall-

•HR 3426 IH
ing behind the PRC in key technologies of the fu-
1
ture. While private-sector research and development 
2
investments have steadily increased in the United 
3
States, Federal Government spending has declined 
4
as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product from ap-
5
proximately 1.2 percent in 1976 to approximately 
6
0.7 percent in 2018. The decline has been even 
7
steeper in the physical sciences. The Federal Gov-
8
ernment plays a unique and critical role in Amer-
9
ica’s innovation ecosystem. Government research and 
10
development spending spurs private-sector invest-
11
ments, and the United States Government remains 
12
the largest source of basic research funding, which 
13
is foundational to game-changing technological 
14
achievements. 
15
(19) During the past several years, the PRC 
16
has quadrupled its research and development spend-
17
ing and is on the brink of surpassing the United 
18
States in total investments in key technologies, with 
19
its growth in research and development spending 
20
doubling the United States Government’s spending 
21
increase in this area. Chinese patent publications 
22
have surged in the fields of artificial intelligence, 
23
machine learning, and deep learning.

(20) The United States is highly dependent on 
1
China for key components of critical technologies in 
2
its supply chains, such as rare earths. 
3
(21) The United States remains a leader in the 
4
science and technology areas of engineering and biol-
5
ogy as well as key components, including tele-
6
communications equipment and semiconductors. The 
7
United States does not have a domestic manufac-
8
turer of radio access network equipment for 5G net-
9
works, but is well-positioned to lead in 6G tele-
10
communications, which depend on software and 
11
semiconductors, areas of United States strength. 
12
(22) Other countries have unique knowledge, 
13
expertise, and capabilities in numerous cutting edge 
14
technologies, including semiconductor manufacturing 
15
equipment, such as extreme ultraviolet lithography 
16
machines for semiconductor fabrication and machine 
17
tools for fabrication of custom components. In order 
18
to successfully compete against the PRC, the United 
19
States must partner with such countries. 
20
(23) The private sector in the United States 
21
and partner countries, including Japan, Korea, Aus-
22
tralia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the 
23
European Union has considerable expertise in both 
24
technology and in standard setting, given the role of

It is the sense of Congress that— 
5
(1) emerging technology governance regimes 
6
driven by undemocratic governments that do not re-
7
flect democratic values are gaining traction inter-
8
nationally through coercive, diplomatic, and unfair 
9
economic, trade, and development practices; 
10
(2) the United States is failing to lead inter-
11
national efforts or prioritize multilateral coordina-
12
tion, institutions, and legal compatibility in the area 
13
of technology governance, ceding leadership to au-
14
thoritarian regimes and risking the growth of anti- 
15
democratic norms and standards around tech-
16
nologies; and 
17
(3) promoting greater coordination, common 
18
functional problem-solving institutional mechanisms, 
19
and more compatible legal regimes among demo-
20
cratic nations is essential to create an international 
21
technology governance architecture that benefits all
