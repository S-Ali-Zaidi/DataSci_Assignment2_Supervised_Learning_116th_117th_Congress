SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Protecting Commu-
2
nities from Plastics Act’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds that— 
5
(1) plastics production is exacerbating the cli-
6
mate crisis and driving environmental injustice in 
7
vulnerable communities located near petrochemical 
8
facilities; 
9
(2) plastics production is on track to double in 
10
the decade following the date of enactment of this 
11
Act, locking in harmful emissions for decades; 
12
(3) plastics and other petrochemicals are fore-
13
casted to become the largest driver of oil and hy-
14
draulically fractured gas demand by 2050; 
15
(4) some studies have projected that the plas-
16
tics industry will emit more greenhouse gas emis-
17
sions than coal plants in the United States by 2030; 
18
(5) petrochemical facilities that produce plastics 
19
are more likely to be located in low-income commu-
20
nities and communities of color, disproportionately 
21
exposing those communities to harmful pollutants; 
22
(6) plastics production and certain disposal fa-
23
cilities pollute surrounding communities with chemi-
24
cals that are known to cause cancer, birth defects, 
25
and other serious illnesses;

•HR 9388 IH
(7) transitioning off fossil fuels for power gen-
1
eration and transportation only to replace that de-
2
mand with more fossil fuel-based plastics production 
3
is not a viable strategy and fails to protect commu-
4
nities; 
5
(8) plastics carry impacts throughout their 
6
lifecycles, including the impacts of— 
7
(A) oil and gas extraction; 
8
(B) plastics refining, manufacturing, and 
9
certain methods of disposal; and 
10
(C) plastics pollution that ends up in com-
11
munities and in the environment, where the de-
12
grading plastics leach chemical additives and 
13
emit greenhouse gases; 
14
(9) addressing the plastics crisis requires a shift 
15
away from single-use plastics in nonessential set-
16
tings; and 
17
(10) technologies that convert plastics to fuel, 
18
use plastics for energy generation, generate feed-
19
stocks for the chemical industry, or produce haz-
20
ardous waste and toxic air pollution are not a sus-
21
tainable solution to the plastics crisis.
