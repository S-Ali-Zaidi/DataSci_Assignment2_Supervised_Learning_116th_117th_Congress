SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Wage Theft Prevention 
2
and Wage Recovery Act’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) Wage theft occurs when an employer does 
6
not pay an employee for work that the employee has 
7
performed, depriving the worker of wages and earn-
8
ings to which the worker is legally entitled. This 
9
theft occurs in many forms, including by employers 
10
violating minimum wage requirements, failing to pay 
11
overtime compensation, requiring off-the-clock work, 
12
failing to provide final payments, misclassifying em-
13
ployees as being exempt from overtime compensation 
14
or as independent contractors rather than as em-
15
ployees, and improperly withholding tips. 
16
(2) Wage theft poses a serious and growing 
17
problem across industries for working individuals of 
18
the United States. Wage theft is widespread and is 
19
estimated 
to 
cost 
workers 
more 
than 
20
$15,000,000,000 per year. In certain industries, 
21
compliance with Federal wage and hour laws is less 
22
than 50 percent. 
23
(3) Wage theft is closely associated with em-
24
ployment discrimination, with women, immigrants, 
25
and racial and ethnic minorities being disproportion-
26

ately affected. Women are significantly more likely 
1
to experience minimum wage violations than men, 
2
foreign-born workers are nearly 2 times as likely to 
3
experience minimum wage violations as their coun-
4
terparts born in the United States, and African 
5
Americans are 3 times more likely to experience 
6
minimum wage violations than their White counter-
7
parts. 
8
(4) Wage theft is closely associated with unsafe 
9
working conditions. 
10
(5) Wage theft— 
11
(A) depresses the wages of working fami-
12
lies who are already struggling to make ends 
13
meet; 
14
(B) strains social services funds; 
15
(C) diminishes consumer spending power 
16
and hurts local economies; 
17
(D) reduces vital State and Federal tax 
18
revenues; 
19
(E) places law-abiding employers at a com-
20
petitive disadvantage with noncompliant em-
21
ployers; 
22
(F) burdens commerce and the free flow of 
23
goods; and 
24
20:42 May 11, 2022
H7701
4 
•HR 7701 IH
(G) lowers labor standards throughout 
1
labor markets. 
2
(6) Low-wage workers are at the greatest risk 
3
of suffering from wage theft. A survey of 4,387 low- 
4
wage workers in New York, Los Angeles, and Chi-
5
cago found that 68 percent of the workers surveyed 
6
had experienced some form of wage theft in the 
7
workweek immediately before the survey was con-
8
ducted. These workers experienced a range of wage 
9
and hour violations: 26 percent of such workers were 
10
not paid minimum wage; 76 percent of such workers 
11
who worked more than 40 hours in the workweek 
12
immediately before the survey was conducted were 
13
not paid at the overtime rate; and, in the year before 
14
the survey was conducted, 43 percent of the workers 
15
who attempted to address such issues by filing a 
16
complaint with their employer or who attempted to 
17
form a labor organization experienced retaliation by 
18
their employers, including by being fired, suspended, 
19
or receiving threats of reductions in their hours or 
20
pay. 
21
(7) In 2012, State and Federal authorities as 
22
well as private attorneys recovered at least 
23
$933,000,000 in wage theft enforcement actions, 
24
which was nearly 3 times the value of all bank rob-
25

•HR 7701 IH
beries, residential robberies, convenience store and 
1
gas station robberies, and street robberies in the 
2
United States during that year. 
3
(8) A Department of Labor study of wage theft 
4
in California and New York found that wage theft 
5
deprived workers of 37 percent to 49 percent of 
6
their income, pushing at least 15,000 families below 
7
the poverty line and driving another 50,000 to 
8
100,000 families deeper into poverty. 
9
(9) A study analyzing wage theft claims in the 
10
State of Washington from 2009 to 2013 estimated 
11
that the total economic cost of wage theft to the 
12
State totaled more than $64,000,000 resulting from 
13
the lower economic activity and spending of low- 
14
wage workers due to their lost wages. 
15
(10) A Department of Labor study of wage vio-
16
lations in California and New York found that wage 
17
theft deprived families of $5,600,000 in possible 
18
earned income tax credits and resulted in a 
19
$22,000,000 
loss 
in 
State 
tax 
revenue, 
a 
20
$238,000,000 loss in payroll tax revenue, and a 
21
$113,000,000 loss in Federal income tax revenue. 
22
(11) Barriers to addressing wage theft continue 
23
to exist decades after the enactment of the Fair 
24
Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 201 et 
25
20:42 May 11, 2022
H7701
6 
•HR 7701 IH
seq.). These barriers have resulted, in significant 
1
part, because enforcement of such Act has not 
2
worked as Congress originally intended and because 
3
many of the provisions of such Act do not include 
4
sufficient penalties to discourage violations. Improve-
5
ments to enforcement and amendments to such Act 
6
are necessary to ensure that such Act provides effec-
7
tive protection to individuals subject to wage theft. 
8
(12) The lack of a Federal right for employees 
9
to receive full compensation at the agreed upon wage 
10
rate for all work performed by the employee has re-
11
sulted in workers being able to recover only the ap-
12
plicable minimum wage, or the overtime rate if ap-
13
plicable, when employers engage in wage theft. 
14
(13) The lack of a Federal requirement to pro-
15
vide employees with paystubs indicating how their 
16
pay is calculated or to allow employees to inspect 
17
their employers’ payroll records significantly impedes 
18
efforts to identify and challenge wage theft. 
19
(14) The lack of a Federal requirement to pay 
20
employees their final payments in a timely manner 
21
upon termination of the employment relationship be-
22
tween the employer and employee has led to unrea-
23
sonable, and sometimes indefinite, delays in com-
24
pensation after an employment relationship ends.

(15) While the Fair Labor Standards Act of 
1
1938, and regulations promulgated by the Secretary 
2
of Labor, as in effect on the day before the date of 
3
enactment of this Act, require employers to com-
4
pensate employees at the minimum wage rate and to 
5
provide overtime compensation when appropriate, 
6
the lack of civil penalties for most violations of these 
7
requirements has dampened their effectiveness. 
8
(16) While the Fair Labor Standards Act of 
9
1938 and regulations promulgated by the Secretary 
10
of Labor, as in effect on the day before the date of 
11
enactment of this Act, provide employees who are 
12
subject to wage theft with the right to unpaid min-
13
imum wages or unpaid overtime compensation plus 
14
an additional equal amount as liquidated damages, 
15
this low level of damages has proved insufficient to 
16
deter employers from stealing the wages of their em-
17
ployees. 
18
(17) While the Fair Labor Standards Act of 
19
1938 and regulations promulgated by the Secretary 
20
of Labor, as in effect on the day before the date of 
21
enactment of this Act, require employers to keep 
22
records of employees’ pay, the lack of remedies be-
23
yond injunctive relief for this requirement diminishes 
24
the effectiveness of the requirement.

(18) While the Fair Labor Standards Act of 
1
1938 and regulations promulgated by the Secretary 
2
of Labor, as in effect on the day before the date of 
3
enactment of this Act, provide for limited criminal 
4
penalties when employers violate the provisions of 
5
such Act, the Secretary of Labor rarely resorts to 
6
these penalties, causing them to serve as a hollow 
7
threat. 
8
(19) The statute of limitations under section 6 
9
of the Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947 (29 U.S.C. 255), 
10
as in effect on the day before the date of enactment 
11
of this Act, precludes employees from commencing a 
12
claim for wage theft more than 2 years after the 
13
cause of action accrued, or more than 3 years after 
14
the cause of action accrued if the claim is with re-
15
spect to a willful violation by the employer. Addition-
16
ally, the statute of limitations is not automatically 
17
suspended while the Secretary of Labor investigates 
18
a complaint. These strict confines of the statute of 
19
limitations sometimes result in employees being de-
20
prived of their ability to institute a private lawsuit 
21
against their employer in order to recover their sto-
22
len wages. 
23
(20) Section 16(b) of the Fair Labor Standards 
24
Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 216(b)), as in effect on the 
25
20:42 May 11, 2022
H7701
9 
•HR 7701 IH
day before the date of enactment of this Act, re-
1
quires employees to affirmatively ‘‘opt-in’’ in order 
2
to be a party plaintiff in a collective action brought 
3
by another aggrieved employee seeking to recover 
4
stolen wages in court. This provision limits the abil-
5
ity of employees to unite and pursue private lawsuits 
6
against employers. 
7
(21) Under the penalty structure of the Fair 
8
Labor Standards Act of 1938, as in effect on the 
9
day before the date of enactment of this Act, many 
10
employers who are caught violating such Act con-
11
tinue to violate the Act. A Department of Labor in-
12
vestigation found that one-third of employers who 
13
had previously engaged in wage theft continued to 
14
do so. 
15
(22) The Government Accountability Office and 
16
the Department of Labor have recognized that when 
17
employers are assessed civil penalties, they are more 
18
likely to comply with the law in the future and other 
19
employers in the same region—regardless of indus-
20
try—are also more likely to comply with the law. 
21
(23) States that have enacted legislation to ad-
22
dress wage theft by increasing the damages to which 
23
employees are entitled following violations of wage 
24
and hour laws have positively impacted the workers 
25
20:42 May 11, 2022
H7701
10 
•HR 7701 IH
in such States. However, many States have not en-
1
acted such legislation and, worse still, some States 
2
do not have any laws protecting workers from wage 
3
theft or even agencies to enforce workers’ rights to 
4
compensation for work. This discrepancy in State 
5
laws has resulted in a fragmentation of workers’ 
6
rights across the United States, with some workers 
7
having a measure of protection from wage theft and 
8
other workers being left extremely vulnerable to 
9
wage theft. 
10
(24) Effective enforcement of wage and hour 
11
laws is critical to increasing compliance. Given the 
12
limited resources available for enforcement, en-
13
hanced strategic enforcement of Federal wage and 
14
hour laws is crucial. 
15
(25) For enhanced strategic enforcement to be 
16
effective, government regulators must work with 
17
community stakeholders who have direct knowledge 
18
of ongoing violations of Federal wage and hour re-
19
quirements and who are in a position to prevent 
20
such violations. 
21
(26) Partnerships between regulators, workers, 
22
nonprofit organizations, and businesses can increase 
23
compliance by educating workers about their rights, 
24
collecting evidence, reporting violations, identifying 
25
20:42 May 11, 2022
H7701
11 
•HR 7701 IH
noncompliant employers, and modeling good prac-
1
tices. 
2
(27) Partnerships between regulators, workers, 
3
nonprofit organizations, and businesses have been 
4
successful in combating wage theft. In 2006, the Di-
5
vision of Labor Standards Enforcement of the State 
6
of California created a janitorial enforcement team 
7
to work closely with a local janitorial watchdog orga-
8
nization. As of 2015, the partnership had resulted in 
9
countless administrative, civil, and criminal actions 
10
against employers and in the collection of more than 
11
$68,000,000 in back pay for janitorial workers. 
12
(28) The Comptroller General of the United 
13
States has recommended that the Department of 
14
Labor identify ways to leverage its resources to bet-
15
ter combat wage theft by improving services pro-
16
vided through partnerships.
