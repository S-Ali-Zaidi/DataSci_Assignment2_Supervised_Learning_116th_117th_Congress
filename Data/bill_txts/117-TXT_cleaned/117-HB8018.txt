(1) clean and safe drinking water is necessary

to ensure public health and a vibrant economy; 
2
(2) communities that are dependent on private 
3
groundwater supplies to meet domestic drinking 
4
water needs, as well as those that continue to experi-
5
ence drinking water infrastructure challenges from 
6
public water supplies, including with infrastructure 
7
into and within households and living facilities, are 
8
disproportionately impacted by drinking water qual-
9
ity issues; 
10
(3) in many instances, those communities and 
11
their households have been adversely impacted by 
12
the presence of 1 or more naturally occurring and 
13
human-caused contaminants found in drinking 
14
water, such as lead, arsenic, nitrate, nitrite, and 
15
volatile organic compounds, as well as federally un-
16
regulated contaminants, including perfluoroalkyl and 
17
polyfluoroalkyl substances and hexavalent chromium

among the major diseases and contaminants that

(5) investments in projects to improve and sup-
3
port drinking water infrastructure are critically im-
4
portant to addressing water quality in the United 
5
States, but because those projects can typically take 
6
many years to complete, the current, and in some 
7
cases the ongoing, needs of communities impacted 
8
with immediate drinking water quality challenges

cannot be or are not addressed in a timely manner;

(6) as an interim measure (and in some cases

in rural areas, for longer term or permanently),

point-of-entry and point-of-use water quality im-

to provide financial assistance for eligible grant re-
