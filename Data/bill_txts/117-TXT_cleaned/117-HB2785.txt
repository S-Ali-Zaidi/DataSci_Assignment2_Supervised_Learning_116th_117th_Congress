A BILL 
To establish in the Department of State the United States 
Energy Resource Governance Initiative to promote sound 
mining sector governance and resilient energy mineral 
supply chains by bringing countries together to engage 
on advancing governance principles, sharing best prac-
tices, and encouraging a level playing field for invest-
ment, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Energy Resource Gov-
2
ernance Initiative Act of 2021’’. 
3
SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
4
It is the sense of Congress that— 
5
(1) diverse and resilient energy and mineral 
6
supply chains are vital for the United States, our 
7
partners and allies, and for global economic stability; 
8
(2) many green and renewable energy tech-
9
nologies, including electric vehicles, wind turbines, 
10
and battery storage technology, require high inputs 
11
of specific energy minerals, which may cause the 
12
global demand for these products to skyrocket over 
13
the coming decades; 
14
(3) United States and international efforts to 
15
drive global emission reductions and net zero goals 
16
rely on these critical minerals to deploy clean energy 
17
technologies; 
18
(4) vulnerable critical mineral supply chains 
19
present a significant risk to United States national 
20
security interests, including— 
21
(A) overreliance on a single or limited sup-
22
ply source for critical mineral inputs; and 
23
(B) poor mineral sector governance, includ-
24
ing weak labor standards, limited environmental 
25
protections, failure to develop a social license to

operate, which deters responsible investment 
1
and limits the long-term sustainability of min-
2
ing operations; 
3
(5) the People’s Republic of China (PRC) leads 
4
the world in the mining and production of rare earth 
5
metals, comprising nearly 90 percent of the global 
6
market, and it is in the national security interest of 
7
the United States to provide an alternative to PRC 
8
domination of these supply chains; and 
9
(6) the United States should build upon the ef-
10
forts made with the Governments of Australia, Bot-
11
swana, Canada, and Peru in creating the Energy 
12
Resource Governance Initiative (ERGI) to advance 
13
governance principles and best practices for mineral 
14
extraction. 
15
SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
16
It is the policy of the United States to— 
17
(1) promote sound mining sector governance 
18
and resilient energy mineral supply chains by bring-
19
ing countries together to engage on advancing gov-
20
ernance principles, sharing best practices, and en-
21
couraging a level playing field for investment; 
22
(2) encourage governments to incorporate re-
23
sponsible mineral supply chain sourcing principles

into their national climate strategies and clean en-
1
ergy technology procurement plans; and 
2
(3) encourage companies, including green and 
3
renewable energy, to source 100 percent of their 
4
critical mineral supply from responsible and environ-
5
mentally sound supply chains by 2030.

14
practices globally by enabling sharing of best prac-
15
tices for mineral extraction management and govern-
16
ance. 
17
(2) Foster integrated and resilient supply 
18
chains and help identify options to diversify and 
19
strengthen supply chains. 
20
(3) Facilitate trade and industry connections to 
21
promote responsible critical mineral sourcing and 
22
advance mineral sector good governance.

commercialize critical mineral sector resources, and 
2
mitigate supply chain vulnerabilities.

(5) Encourage the international community to 
4
incorporate 
responsible 
mineral 
supply 
chain
