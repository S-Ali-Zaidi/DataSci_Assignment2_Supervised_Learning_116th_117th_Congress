SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:

•HR 8651 IH
(1) Extradition is the formal surrender of a 
1
person by one state to another state for prosecution 
2
or punishment. 
3
(2) Refusal by other nations to extradite or oth-
4
erwise render to the United States fugitives within 
5
their jurisdiction who have been convicted of com-
6
mitting crimes on United States soil impedes the ju-
7
dicial process and undermines the rule of law. 
8
(3) The United States has bilateral extradition 
9
treaties with more than 100 nations and an extra-
10
dition agreement with the European Union. 
11
(4) The United States has bilateral extradition 
12
treaties with Portugal and Cuba. 
13
(5) The failure to bring criminal fugitives to 
14
justice in the United States is an affront to the vic-
15
tims of those crimes. 
16
(6) The refusal of Portugal, a close ally and 
17
good friend of the United States, to extradite George 
18
Wright, convicted of the 1962 murder of Walter 
19
Patterson, fugitive from justice since his 1970 es-
20
cape from the Bayside State Prison in New Jersey, 
21
is a deplorable example of a failure to extradite, and 
22
has caused ongoing suffering and stress to Mr. Pat-
23
terson’s surviving family and friends.

(7) The refusal of Cuba to extradite or other-
1
wise render Joanne Chesimard, an escaped convict 
2
who fled to Cuba after killing Werner Foerster, New 
3
Jersey State Trooper, is a deplorable example of a 
4
failure to extradite or otherwise render, and has 
5
caused ongoing suffering and stress to Mr. 
6
Foerster’s surviving family and friends. 
7
(8) The refusals to extradite George Wright 
8
and Joanne Chesimard are emblematic of a number 
9
of such refusals from other nations, such that 
10
United States policies and efforts to secure extra-
11
dition and the extradition policies of countries from 
12
which the United States seeks extradition and ren-
13
dition bear further examination. 
14
(9) Such examination will be promoted by the 
15
issuance of a public report on the status of extra-
16
dition requests by the United States and related 
17
matters. 
18
(b) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act is to provide 
19
information necessary to evaluate and thereby strengthen 
20
United States Government efforts to extradite fugitives. 
21
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
22
It is the sense of Congress that in meetings with for-
23
eign officials of countries from which the United States 
24
seeks the extradition of fugitives, United States ambas-

3
murderer of Walter Patterson of New Jersey, and Joanne 
4
Chesimard, an escaped convict and the murderer of New 
5
Jersey State Trooper Werner Foerster.
