coyotes, foxes, and wild dogs suspected of preying on 
1
livestock and poultry. 
2
(2) Sodium cyanide is registered for restricted 
3
use under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and 
4
Rodenticide Act (7 U.S.C. 136 et seq.) as a Cat-
5
egory One acute toxicant, the most hazardous Envi-
6
ronmental Protection Agency classification available, 
7
due to the harm it poses to people and the environ-
8
ment. 
9
(3) Poisoning by sodium cyanide leads to cen-
10
tral nervous system depression, cardiac arrest, res-
11
piratory failure, paralysis, and blindness. 
12
(4) The Environmental Protection Agency au-
13
thorizes the use of M–44 devices nationwide, and in 
14
recent years, M–44s were used in Colorado, Idaho, 
15
North Dakota, Nebraska, New Mexico, Nevada, 
16
Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, 
17
and Wyoming. 
18
(5) In 2017, an M–44 device exposed an Idaho 
19
child to a sublethal dose of sodium cyanide with sub-
20
sequent short-term and long-term medical complica-
21
tions. Two Wyoming children were also exposed to 
22
the poison from another M–44 device. Three family 
23
dogs died in these two separate incidents.

(6) The indiscriminate M–44 device commonly 
1
harms nontarget wildlife and people; at least 42 peo-
2
ple have accidentally triggered a cyanide bomb caus-
3
ing exposure to cyanide gas and injuries since 1984. 
4
(7) M–44 devices kill targeted animals only 53 
5
percent of the time. Thousands of nontarget species 
6
of animals have been killed by M–44s, including bald 
7
eagles, golden eagles, gray wolves, black bears, griz-
8
zly bears, bobcats, fishers, and family dogs. 
9
(8) Despite the United States Fish and Wildlife 
10
Service determining in 1993 that M–44 devices 
11
could kill endangered species like the California Con-
12
dor, the use of the M–44 continues in areas where 
13
endangered species are found and continues to result 
14
in the deaths of endangered species.
