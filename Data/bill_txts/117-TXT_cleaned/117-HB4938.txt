SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
1
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following find-
2
ings: 
3
(1) In the United States, according to the Cen-
4
ters for Disease Control and Prevention, there are 
5
more than 61,000,000 adults who are individuals 
6
with disabilities and, according to the Bureau of the 
7
Census, there are more than 47,800,000 adults age 
8
65 or older. 
9
(2) There have been more than 80 hurricanes, 
10
resulting in thousands of deaths, in the United 
11
States since 2005. 
12
(3) The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Ad-
13
ministration estimates that— 
14
(A) the cumulative damage from weather- 
15
and climate-related disasters in 2017 cost the 
16
United States over $300,000,000,000; and 
17
(B) 17 of the disasters in 2017 cost over 
18
$1,000,000,000 each. 
19
(4) Individuals with disabilities and older adults 
20
have been found to die at higher rates, compared to 
21
the general population, during disasters. 
22
(5) According to the Federal Emergency Man-
23
agement Administration— 
24
18:48 Aug 12, 2021
H4938
3 
•HR 4938 IH
(A) more than 48,000,000 people were af-
1
fected by hurricanes and wildfires between Au-
2
gust and December of 2017; and 
3
(B) more than 12,000,000, or one quarter, 
4
of those peoples were adults who were individ-
5
uals with disabilities. 
6
(6) An estimated 70 percent of the deaths at-
7
tributed to Hurricane Maria in 2017 were to people 
8
age 70 or older. 
9
(7) Failure to provide accessibility for, or plan 
10
for accommodating, individuals with physical or sen-
11
sory disabilities, chronic illness, or mental disabilities 
12
decreases the ability of those individuals to evacuate 
13
prior to or during a disaster. 
14
(8) Households of individuals with disabilities 
15
are more likely to need assistance and are less likely 
16
to be able to evacuate in advance of disasters. 
17
(9) Less than a third of individuals with intel-
18
lectual disabilities and individuals needing personal 
19
care attendants have planned with their personal 
20
care providers what to do in a disaster. 
21
(10) Evacuation information, including orders, 
22
is not uniformly communicated in ways and via 
23
media that are accessible to individuals with disabil-
24
ities, including being communicated in ways that 
25
18:48 Aug 12, 2021
H4938
4 
•HR 4938 IH
lack use of American Sign Language, captions, and 
1
plain language on websites, instructional materials, 
2
and television and radio announcements. 
3
(11) Displaced individuals with disabilities 
4
served in general population shelters have better ac-
5
cess to information and material resources than indi-
6
viduals with disabilities in specially designed shel-
7
ters. 
8
(12) Despite better access to information and 
9
resources, personnel in general population shelters 
10
often do not have the resources or training to ad-
11
dress the needs of individuals with disabilities and 
12
older adults. 
13
(13) Public shelters often do not have dis-
14
ability-related accommodations, often forcing individ-
15
uals with disabilities and older adults to be seg-
16
regated, sometimes apart from their families and 
17
natural supports during disasters. 
18
(14) Households with individuals with disabil-
19
ities sustain more costly property damage from dis-
20
asters than households without individuals with dis-
21
abilities. 
22
(15) Historically, disaster-related recommenda-
23
tions for individuals with disabilities and older 
24
adults have been typically aimed at caregivers and 
25
18:48 Aug 12, 2021
H4938

•HR 4938 IH
service providers, not individuals with disabilities 
1
and older adults. 
2
(16) Thousands of individuals with disabilities 
3
have been denied their civil rights because they do 
4
not receive accessible notice during disasters— 
5
(A) of spoken instructions via phone or 
6
video; or 
7
(B) of instructions regarding evacuations, 
8
sheltering, and other procedures during disas-
9
ters. 
10
(17) Disaster shelters and services do not rou-
11
tinely have American Sign Language interpreters 
12
nor procedures written or presented in plain lan-
13
guage. 
14
(18) Individuals with disabilities and older 
15
adults are more at risk for loss of life, loss of inde-
16
pendence, or violation of civil rights than the general 
17
population during times of disasters, response, and 
18
recovery. 
19
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
20
gress that— 
21
(1) individuals with disabilities and older adults 
22

(3) individuals with disabilities and older adults 
14
should have access to shelters and other services 
15
during disasters in the same locations and settings 
16
as the general population; 
17
(4) individuals with disabilities and older adults 
18

19
