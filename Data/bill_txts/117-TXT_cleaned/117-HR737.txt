age for all occupations and double the national average 
for all occupations as reported by the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics; and 
(3) personal appearance services such as shampooing 
and makeup services are projected to grow 17.8 percent 
from 2019 to 2029; 
Whereas all States require barbers, hairstylists, cosmetolo-
gists, and skincare specialists to be licensed, and to qual-
ify for a license candidates are required to graduate from 
a State-approved barber or cosmetology program and 
then pass a State-administered licensing exam; 
Whereas most States regulate massage therapy and require 
massage therapists to complete a postsecondary edu-
cation program of 500 or more hours of study and expe-
rience, in most cases leading to the candidate obtaining 
a license or certification; and 
Whereas without proper education in health and safety re-
quirements, applied technical abilities, and acquired soft 
skills, individuals seeking to enter these in-demand occu-
pations would be unable to acquire the knowledge and 
proficiency required to successfully pass the required 
exam and enter the workforce: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the goals and ideals of ‘‘National 
2
Beauty and Wellness Education Day’’; 
3
(2) recognizes that population growth and the 
4
growing importance of self-care to well-being will 
5
lead to greater demand for beauty and wellness serv-
