•HRES 789 IH 
Whereas the video was posted on Representative Gosar’s offi-
cial Instagram account and used the resources of the 
House of Representatives to further violence against 
elected officials; 
Whereas Representative Gosar issued a statement on Novem-
ber 9, 2021, defending the video as a ‘‘symbolic cartoon’’ 
and spreading hateful and false rhetoric about immi-
grants; 
Whereas the leadership of the Republican Party has failed to 
condemn Representative Gosar’s threats of violence 
against the President of the United States and a fellow 
Member of Congress; 
Whereas the Speaker of the House made clear that threats 
of violence against Members of Congress and the Presi-
dent of the United States should not be tolerated and 
called on the Committee on Ethics of the House and law 
enforcement to investigate the video; 
Whereas depictions of violence can foment actual violence and 
jeopardize the safety of elected officials, as witnessed in 
this chamber on January 6, 2021; 
Whereas violence against women in politics is a global phe-
nomenon meant to silence women and discourage them 
from seeking positions of authority and participating in 
public life, with women of color disproportionately im-
pacted; 
Whereas a 2016 survey by the Inter-Parliamentary Union 
found that 82 percent of women parliamentarians have 
experienced psychological violence and 44 percent re-
ceived threats of death, sexual violence, beatings, or ab-
duction during their term; and
