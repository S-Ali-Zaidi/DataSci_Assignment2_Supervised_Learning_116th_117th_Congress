RESOLUTION 
Affirming the role of the United States in eliminating sexual 
violence in conflict. 
Whereas sexual violence has been used as a weapon of war 
throughout history, whether to subjugate, terrorize, or 
ethnically cleanse populations; 
Whereas the term ‘‘conflict-related sexual violence’’ refers to 
rape, sexual slavery, forced prostitution, forced abortion, 
enforced sterilization, forced marriage, and any other 
form of sexual violence that is directly or indirectly linked 
to a conflict; 
Whereas conflict-related sexual violence directly correlates 
with the resurgence of hostilities, militarization, the pro-

liferation of small arms and light weapons, mass popu-
lation displacement, the rise of violent extremism, the col-
lapse of the rule of law and social support systems; 
Whereas conflict-related sexual violence has been considered 
a war crime, crime against humanity, and an act of geno-
cide and torture under international jurisprudence; 
Whereas despite the numerous international resolutions, con-
ventions, and treaties, sexual violence continues to occur 
in many conflicts across the world with almost total im-
punity; 
Whereas, in 2021, 3,293 verified cases of conflict-related sex-
ual violence were committed, 800 more than in 2020, 
representing a significant increase; 
Whereas substantial gaps remain in the areas of prevention, 
accountability, and compliance; 
Whereas many prescribed prevention measures are inad-
equately implemented and enforced; 
Whereas when perpetrators go unpunished, they are 
emboldened to strike again, perpetuating and encour-
aging vicious cycles of sexual violence even when a coun-
try emerges from conflict; 
Whereas rendering justice to the victims is a precondition for 
reconciliation and peace to take hold; 
Whereas the COVID–19 pandemic led to a global spike in 
gender-based violence and increased challenges to access-
ing services for survivors of conflict-related sexual vio-
lence; 
Whereas the lockdowns, curfews, quarantines, and pandemic- 
related mobility restrictions compounded the chronic 
underreporting of conflict-related sexual violence and fur-

ther complicated the pursuit of justice and redress as the 
work of investigators, judges, prosecutors, and lawyers 
was impacted; 
Whereas women and girls in congested refugee and displace-
ment settings were among the hardest hit by the inter-
secting crises of COVID–19 and conflict, facing elevated 
risks of sexual violence, child marriage, exploitation, and 
trafficking, a situation that was exacerbated by an overall 
decline in humanitarian reach and resources; 
Whereas an individual’s gender, ethnicity, religion, disability, 
socioeconomic status, or displacement status may in-
crease their vulnerability to becoming a victim of conflict- 
related sexual violence; 
Whereas harmful cultural and social norms related to honor, 
shame, victim blaming, and gender discrimination persist 
as both a root cause of sexual violence and an obstacle 
to effective prevention and response efforts; 
Whereas conflict-related sexual violence is also targeted at 
men and boys; 
Whereas a staggering number of children living in conflict 
areas are living near armed groups that perpetrate sexual 
violence; 
Whereas, since 2006, more than 20,000 cases of conflict-re-
lated sexual violence were perpetrated against children; 
Whereas sexual violence against children can be especially 
damaging to their physical and mental health, both in the 
near- and long-term, and can prevent them from reaching 
their full potential; 
Whereas access to safe and effective emergency health care, 
clinics and shelters, reporting mechanisms, justice, and

redress for victims are essential to eliminating sexual vio-
lence in times of conflict; 
Whereas the United States recognizes that successfully elimi-
nating conflict-related sexual violence requires meaningful 
inclusion of women in peace and security processes; 
Whereas the United States continues to serve as a global 
leader in efforts to promote and elevate the women’s par-
ticipation in economic, civic, and security decisionmaking 
and peace processes; and 
Whereas, in 2015, the United Nations General Assembly pro-
claimed June 19 of each year the International Day for 
the Elimination of Sexual Violence in Conflict to raise 
awareness of the need to put an end to conflict-related 
sexual violence, to honor the victims and survivors, and 
to pay tribute to all those who have devoted their lives 
to standing up for the eradication of these crimes: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) affirms the leadership and commitment of 
2
the United States Government in efforts to prevent 
3
conflict-related sexual violence to support and pro-

(2) calls on the United States to ensure mecha-

nisms to hold perpetrators of sexual violence ac-

and that women participate fully in such peace proc-

esses in accordance with the Women, Peace, and Se-
