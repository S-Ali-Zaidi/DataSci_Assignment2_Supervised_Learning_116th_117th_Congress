A BILL 
To reduce instances of placement of inmates in restrictive 
housing, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Solitary Confinement 
4
Reform Act of 2022’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Restrictive housing takes many forms, and 
8
the experience in segregation can vary considerably

depending on certain external factors, such as the 
1
length of stay, conditions of confinement, and degree 
2
of social isolation, as well as factors specific to each 
3
confined person, such as age and psychological resil-
4
iency. 
5
(2) Confined individuals located in restrictive 
6
housing broadly express severe psychological disturb-
7
ances with lasting detrimental consequences as a re-
8
sult of their experience in security housing units. 
9
The Stanford Lab’s interviews revealed a range of 
10
common impairments and adverse consequences as-
11
sociated with long-term, indefinite incarceration. 
12
(3) The majority of confined members endorsed 
13
feeling mood symptoms consistent with the Diag-
14
nostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 
15
(DSM 5) diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder, 
16
including depressed mood, hopelessness, anger, irri-
17
tability, anhedonia, anger, fatigue, feelings of guilt, 
18
loss of appetite, and insomnia. 
19
(4) Nearly all members also endorsed a sense of 
20
anxiety symptoms characteristic of DSM 5 diagnoses 
21
of panic disorder, traumatic stress disorders, and/or 
22
obsessive-compulsive disorders, such as nervousness, 
23
worry, increased heart rate and respiration, sweat-

ing, muscle tension, hyperarousal, paranoia, night-
1
mares, intrusive thoughts, and fear of losing control. 
2
(5) Psychiatric symptoms and diminished ca-
3
pacity for socialization continue to cause psycho-
4
logical suffering and problems with social function 
5
for most of the men now in general population. 
6
(6) Confined members cited emotional numbing 
7
and desensitization as some of the most common re-
8
sponses to living in SHU. 
9
(7) This sense of emotional suppression and 
10
dysregulation continues to be problematic for pris-
11
oners following the transition to the general popu-
12
lation. Class members also reported significant alter-
13
ations in cognition and perception. 
14
(8) Problems with attention, concentration, and 
15
memory were common, and described as persistent 
16
and worsening. 
17
(9) Some of the most pronounced and enduring 
18
effects of long-term isolation appeared to have re-
19
sulted from relational estrangement and social isola-
20
tion; prisoners frequently reported losing, over time, 
21
the motivation to seek social connection.
