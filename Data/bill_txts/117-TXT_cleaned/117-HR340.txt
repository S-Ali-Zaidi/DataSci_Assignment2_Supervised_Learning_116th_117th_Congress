Whereas Russia is a signatory of the Helsinki Final Act 
obliging the Government of Russia to respect and protect

Magnitsky who died tragically in a Russian prison;

ical role in ensuring Russian and global audiences hear

renal failure and heart problems, and in a moribund 
state;

Mr. Navalny; and

ger: Now, therefore, be it
