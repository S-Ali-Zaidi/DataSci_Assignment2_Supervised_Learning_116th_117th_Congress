for All Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) In 1966, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., said 
3
‘‘Of all the forms of inequality, injustice in health 
4
care is the most shocking and inhuman because it 
5
often results in physical death.’’. 
6
(2) Inequity in health care remains a persistent 
7
and devastating reality for many communities, but, 
8
in particular, communities of color. 
9
(3) The provision of inequitable health care has 
10
complex causes, many stemming from systemic in-
11
equality in access to health care, housing, nutrition, 
12
economic opportunity, education, and other factors. 
13
(4) Health care outcomes for Black commu-
14
nities in particular lag far behind those of the popu-
15
lation as a whole. 
16
(5) Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the Na-
17
tional Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, 
18
said on April 7, 2020, the coronavirus outbreak is 
19
‘‘shining a bright light’’ on ‘‘unacceptable’’ health 
20
disparities in the Black community. 
21
(6) A contributing factor in health disparities is 
22
explicit and implicit bias in the delivery of health 
23
care, resulting in inferior care and poorer outcomes 
24
for some patients on the basis of factors including 
25
22:40 Nov 02, 2021
H5742
3 
•HR 5742 IH
race, national origin, sex (including sexual orienta-
1
tion or gender identity), disability, age, or religion. 
2
(7) The National Academy of Medicine (for-
3
merly known as the ‘‘Institute of Medicine’’) issued 
4
a report in 2002 titled ‘‘Unequal Treatment’’, find-
5
ing that racial and ethnic minorities receive lower- 
6
quality health care than Whites do, even when insur-
7
ance status, income, age, and severity of condition is 
8
comparable. 
9
(8) Just as Congress has sought to eliminate 
10
bias, both explicit and implicit, in employment, hous-
11
ing, and other parts of our society, the elimination 
12
of bias and the legacy of structural racism in health 
13
care is of paramount importance.

19
cant public importance. 
20
(B) CASES BY REFERRAL.—The Director 
21
may determine, based on a pattern of com-
22
plaints, a pattern of violations, a review of data 
23
reported by a health care provider covered by 
24
subsection (a), or any other means, that there 
25
22:40 Nov 02, 2021
H5742
19 
•HR 5742 IH
is reasonable cause to believe a health care pro-
1
vider is engaged in a pattern or practice that 
2
violates subsection (a). If the Director makes 
3
such a determination, the Director shall refer 
4
the related findings to the Attorney General. If

cause exists, the Attorney General may com-
7
mence a civil action in any appropriate district

court of the United States.

15
whom the subpoena was addressed resides, was 
16
served, or transacts business.

ACTIONS.—
