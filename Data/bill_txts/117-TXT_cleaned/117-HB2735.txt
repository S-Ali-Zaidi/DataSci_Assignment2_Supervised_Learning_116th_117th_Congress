Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

Congress finds the following:

•HR 2735 IH
(1) The global financial crisis cost Americans 
1
$19 trillion in lost wealth. 
2
(2) The global financial crisis was caused by fi-
3
nancial firms taking great financial risks without 
4
disclosing those risks to their investors or their regu-
5
lators, and by regulatory failures to adequately po-
6
lice the financial services markets for crime, unfair 
7
or deceptive practices, fraud, lack of transparency, 
8
and mismanagement. 
9
(3) Deceptive, illegal, and speculative financial 
10
practices have harmed public confidence in the integ-
11
rity and fairness of many United States financial in-
12
stitutions, and threaten the basic strengths of the 
13
United States economic system. 
14
(4) American citizens provided the money to 
15
stabilize the financial sector, making $700 billion 
16
available to 800 financial institutions, automakers, 
17
and insurance companies. 
18
(5) The global financial crisis, along with the 
19
wars, unabated and unaddressed climate change, 
20
unsustainable tax cuts, and a continuing unemploy-
21
ment crisis, if unaddressed, will deprive a generation 
22
of a meaningful role in the larger economy. 
23
(6) Nurses, teachers, public safety officers, and 
24
other public sector workers have faced drastic fund-

ing cuts, harming our long-term public safety and 
1
prospects for economic growth. 
2
(7) Extreme weather events rooted in climate 
3
change, including flood, drought, fire, super storms 
4
like Sandy, as well as ‘‘slow-onset’’ events like sea 
5
level rise, are wreaking havoc in the United States 
6
and across the globe resulting in climate change im-
7
pacts that jeopardize the lives and livelihoods of 
8
Americans, causing large-scale food and energy inse-
9
curity in developing countries, and extolling untold 
10
economic costs. 
11
(8) According to economists, a small tax on 
12
transfer of ownership of every financial trade could 
13
generate hundreds of billions annually in revenue, 
14
which when invested could help create millions of 
15
good-paying jobs in both the public and private sec-
16
tors every year, as well as provide urgently needed 
17
funding for programs to combat climate change and 
18
address global health and development issues. 
19
(9) A transactions tax will help limit high fre-
20
quency trading which may be as high as 70 percent 
21
of the market and results in declining market sta-
22
bility through extreme price volatility, distorted mar-
23
ket prices, and structural vulnerability to speculation

far in excess of the liquidity needs of commercial 
1
hedgers. 
2
(10) A securities transfer tax would have a neg-
3
ligible impact on the average investor. 
4
(11) The United States had a transfer tax from 
5
1914 to 1966: The Revenue Act of 1914 (Act of 
6
Oct. 22, 1914 (ch. 331, 38 Stat. 745)) levied a 0.02 
7
percent tax on all sales or transfers of stock which 
8
was doubled in 1932 to help overcome the budgetary 
9
challenges during the Great Depression. 
10
(12) Forty nations have or have had some form 
11
of a financial transactions tax; it is endorsed by 
12
more than 1,000 economists; and 10 European 
13
countries are moving forward on implementing a co-
14
ordinated financial transactions tax after European 
15
Union finance ministers signaled approval in Janu-
16
ary 2013. 
17
(13) Revenue generated by this tax could be 
18
available to— 
19
(A) create a more dynamic economy and 
20
enhance economic opportunity by providing free 
21
college education and lessening student debt;
