Earth’s surface, including the three sub-regions 
1
of Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia; and 
2
(C) face shared challenges in development 
3
that have distinct local contexts, including cli-
4
mate change and rising sea levels, geographic 
5
distances from major markets, and vulnerability 
6
to external shocks such as natural disasters. 
7
(2) The United States is a Pacific country with 
8
longstanding ties and shared values and interests 
9
with the Pacific Islands, including through the Com-
10
pacts of Free Association with the Freely Associated 
11
States, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the 
12
Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of 
13
Palau. 
14
(3) The United States has vital national secu-
15
rity interests in the Pacific Islands, including— 
16

(4) Successive United States administrations 
1
have recognized the importance of the Pacific region, 
2
including the Pacific Islands, in high-level strategic 
3
documents, including the following: 
4
(A) The 2015 National Security Strategy, 
5
which first declared the rebalance to Asia and 
6
the Pacific, affirmed the United States as a Pa-
7
cific nation, and paved the way for subsequent 
8
United States engagement with the Pacific Is-
9
lands, including several new policies focused on 
10
conservation and resilience to climate change 
11
announced in September 2016. 
12
(B) The 2017 National Security Strategy, 
13
which includes a commitment to ‘‘shore up 
14
fragile partner states in the Pacific Islands re-
15
gion to reduce their vulnerability to economic 
16
fluctuations and natural disasters’’. 
17
(C) The 2019 Indo-Pacific Strategy Re-
18
port, which identified the Pacific Islands as 
19
‘‘critical to U.S. strategy because of our shared 
20
values, interests, and commitments’’ and com-
21
mitted the United States to ‘‘building capacity 
22
and resilience to address maritime security; Ille-
23

trafficking; and resilience to address climate 
1
change and disaster response’’. 
2
(5) The United States has deepened its diplo-
3
matic engagement with the Pacific Islands through 
4
several recent initiatives, including— 
5
(A) the Pacific Pledge, which provided an 
6
additional 
$100,000,000 
in 
2019 
and 
7
$200,000,000 in 2020, on top of the approxi-
8
mately $350,000,000 that the United States 
9
provides annually to the region to support 
10
shared priorities in economic and human devel-
11
opment, climate change, and more; and 
12
(B) the Small and Less Populous Island 
13
Economies (SALPIE) Initiative launched in 
14
March 2021 to strengthen United States col-
15
laboration with island countries and territories, 
16
including in the Pacific Islands, on COVID–19 
17
economic challenges, long-term economic devel-
18
opment, climate change, and other shared inter-
19
ests. 
20
(6) The Boe Declaration on Regional Security, 
21
signed by leaders of the Pacific Islands Forum in 
22
2018, affirmed that climate change ‘‘remains the 
23
single greatest threat to the livelihoods, security, and 
24
wellbeing of the peoples of the Pacific’’ and asserted 
25
17:02 Jun 23, 2021

•HR 2967 IH
‘‘the sovereign right of every Member to conduct its 
1
national affairs free of external interference and co-
2
ercion’’.

(7) The Asian Development Bank has estimated 
4
that the Pacific Islands region needs upwards of 
5
$2.8 billion a year in investment needs through 
6
2030, in addition to $300 million a year for climate 
7
mitigation and adaptation over the same period. 
8
(8) The Pacific Islands swiftly enacted effective 
9
policies to prevent and contain the spread of the 
10
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (commonly referred to as 
11
‘‘COVID–19’’) pandemic to their populations. The 
12
United States has provided over $130,000,000 in as-
13
sistance to the Pacific Islands for their COVID–19 
14
response. However, priorities must be met to ensure 
15
continued success in preventing the spread of the 
16
COVID–19 pandemic, achieving swift and wide-
17
spread vaccinations, and pursuing long-term eco-
18
nomic recovery in the Pacific Islands, including 
19
through— 
20
(A) expanding testing capacity and acquisi-
21
tion of needed medical supplies, including avail-
22
able COVID–19 vaccines and supporting vac-
23
cination efforts, through a reliable supply chain;

4
system and the reliance on food and energy im-
5
ports as well as lost tourism revenue and other 
6
economic and food security damages caused by 
7
the pandemic. 
8
(9) Since 1966, thousands of Peace Corps vol-
9
unteers have proudly served in the Pacific Islands, 
10
building strong people-to-people relationships and 
11
demonstrating the United States commitment to 
12
peace and development in the region. Prior to the 
13
COVID–19 pandemic, the Peace Corps maintained 
14
presence in four countries of the Pacific Islands. 
15
Peace Corps volunteers continue to be in high de-
16
mand in the Pacific Islands and have been requested 
17
across the region.
