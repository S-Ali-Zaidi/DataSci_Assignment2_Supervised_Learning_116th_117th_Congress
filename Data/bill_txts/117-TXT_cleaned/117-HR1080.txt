RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the designation of May 4, 2022, 
as a ‘‘National Day of Reason’’ and recognizing the 
central importance of reason in the betterment of human-
ity. 
Whereas the application of reason has been the essential pre-
condition for humanity’s extraordinary scientific, medical, 
technological, and social progress since before the found-
ing of our country; 
Whereas reason provides vital hope today for confronting the 
environmental 
crises 
of 
our 
day, 
including 
the 
civilizational emergency of climate change, and for culti-
vating the rule of law, democratic institutions, justice, 
and peace among nations;

Whereas irrationality, magical and conspiratorial thinking, 
and disbelief in science have undermined the national ef-
fort to combat the COVID–19 pandemic, contributing to 
the deaths of nearly 1,000,000 people in the United 
States; 
Whereas America’s Founders insisted upon the primacy of 
reason and knowledge in public life, and drafted the Con-
stitution to prevent official establishment of religion and 
to protect freedom of thought, speech, and inquiry in civil 
society; 
Whereas James Madison, author of the First Amendment 
and fourth President of the United States, stated that 
‘‘The advancement and diffusion of knowledge is the only 
guardian of true liberty’’, and ‘‘Knowledge will forever 
govern ignorance, and a people who mean to be their own 
governors, must arm themselves with the power knowl-
edge gives’’; and 
Whereas May 4, 2022, would be an appropriate date to des-
ignate as a ‘‘National Day of Reason’’: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the designation of a ‘‘National 
2
Day of Reason’’; and 
3
(2) encourages all citizens, residents, and visi-
4
tors to join in observing this day and focusing on the 
5
central importance of reason, critical thought, the 
6
scientific method, and free inquiry to resolving social 
7
problems and promoting the welfare of humankind.
