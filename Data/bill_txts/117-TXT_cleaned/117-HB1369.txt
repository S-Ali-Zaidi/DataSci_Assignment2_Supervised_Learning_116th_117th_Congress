and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘American Space Com-
4
merce Act of 2021’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) The United States is the only nation with 
8
a competitive commercial space launch industry.

(2) A robust domestic launch industry and ca-
1
pability is crucial to the United States’ continuing 
2
economic, national security, scientific, and explo-
3
ration leadership. 
4
(3) Commercial space launch vehicles manufac-
5
tured and launched in the United States by United 
6
States launch service providers benefit national secu-
7
rity and the national economy, earth and space 
8
science, and human spaceflight, and are enablers of 
9
the global space economy. 
10
(4) Commercial space launch vehicles manufac-
11
tured and launched in the United States by United 
12
States launch service providers are used for virtually 
13
all United States national security payloads, and 
14
therefore, are indispensable to the security of the 
15
United States, as well as its allies and friends. 
16
(5) Multiple American companies are developing 
17
small launch vehicles to compete in the domestic and 
18
international commercial launch market. These com-
19
panies are financed predominately by private capital, 
20
are independently developing capabilities, and are 
21
primarily serving commercial customers. 
22
(6) Several foreign governments have taken no-
23
tice of U.S. market growth and have begun to fund 
24
their own vehicles to compete within the same mar-

ket. While some of these international vehicles are 
1
putatively ‘‘private,’’ most benefit from subsidies or 
2
developmental support from their national govern-
3
ments. 
4
(7) The 2019 Report to Congress of the United 
5
States-China Economic and Security Review Com-
6
mission stated, ‘‘China is taking steps to establish a 
7
commanding position in the commercial launch and 
8
satellite sectors relying in part on aggressive state- 
9
backed financing that foreign market-driven compa-
10
nies cannot match’’. 
11
(8) The report further adds, ‘‘China has al-
12
ready succeeded in undercutting some U.S. and 
13
other foreign launch and satellite providers in the 
14
international market, threatening to hollow out these 
15
countries’ space industrial bases’’. 
16
(9) China announced a plan to advance its 
17
Space ambitions by creating a Space Economic Zone 
18
to generate $10 trillion annually. 
19
(10) The U.S. commercial launch industry, 
20
whose viability the National Aeronautics and Space 
21
Administration and the Department of Defense de-
22
pend on to launch critical national assets, is forced 
23
to compete with state-backed launch enterprises

across the globe whose launch providers are not re-
1
quired to be profitable. 
2
(11) A strong domestic space launch industry is 
3
in the national security interest of the United 
4
States. 
5
(12) Foreign launch providers are heavily sub-
6
sidized by their governments and use these subsidies 
7
to intentionally price below cost in an effort to un-
8
dercut American competition, materially harming the 
9
American industrial base. 
10
(13) Increased use of United States-manufac-
11
tured commercial launch vehicles launched in the 
12
United States by United States launch service pro-
13
viders should be encouraged. 
14
(14) Congress supports continued United States 
15
leadership in space.
