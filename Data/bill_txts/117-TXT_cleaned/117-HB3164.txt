•HR 3164 IH
(1) Children and pets left unattended in vehi-
1
cles, or children independently accessing unoccupied 
2
vehicles, are a significant public health and safety 
3
problem. 
4
(2) Millions of children are transported every 
5
day in the back seat of vehicles and are at risk of 
6
being unknowingly left behind and dying or suffering 
7
serious injuries from heatstroke. 
8
(3) Data collected by KidsAndCars.org found 
9
information about at least 8,000 children left alone 
10
in hot cars or as a result of gaining access independ-
11
ently into unoccupied cars between 1990 and 2020. 
12
Of those, over 990 children have been killed due to 
13
heatstroke and more than 1,200 children were in-
14
jured. 
15
(4) Over the past 30 years, child hot car deaths 
16
have continued to trend upwards despite widespread 
17
education programs and public awareness. 
18
(5) Inexpensive technology is currently available 
19
to detect the presence of an occupant unattended in 
20
a vehicle and engage a warning. 
21
(b) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act is to reduce 
22
the deaths and injuries that result from occupants being 
23
left unattended in vehicles and instances in which children 
24
independently access an unoccupied vehicle.
