A BILL 
To extend Federal recognition to the Mono Lake Kutzadikaa 
Tribe, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Mono Lake Kutzadikaa 
4
Tribe Recognition Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds as follows: 
7
(1) The Mono Lake Kutzadikaa Tribe has ex-
8
isted for time immemorial in the Mono Basin of 
9
east-central California and adjacent Nevada.

(2) The Mono Lake Kutzadikaa people were 
1
first encountered in 1825 by early trappers in the 
2
area, but were officially documented by the Federal 
3
Government in June 1852 by Army Lieutenant 
4
Tredwell Moore, who was in pursuit of hostile Indi-
5
ans in the Yo-Ham-i-te (today ‘‘Yosemite’’) Valley, 
6
and tracked them through a previously undiscovered 
7
pass through the Sierra Mountains that lead to 
8
Mono Lake. The pass was later named ‘‘Mono Pass’’ 
9
also known as ‘‘Tsadoba’’, after the ‘‘Indians of that 
10
name’’. 
11
(3) The Tribe, like all tribes in California, was 
12
not the beneficiary of a reservation through the trea-
13
ty process and remained landless and without Fed-
14
eral protection in the wake of the California gold 
15
rush and other non-Indian encroachment into the 
16
Tribe’s aboriginal lands. 
17
(4) In 1904, the plight of the Tribe was 
18
brought to the attention of the Committee on Indian 
19
Affairs by the Northern California Indian Associa-
20
tion through a petition and extensive, but not ex-
21
haustive, study documenting the landless Indians in 
22
California. The study identified the numerous tribal 
23
communities in California who were in desperate 
24
need of land, as well as Federal support and protec-
25

tion, and the Mono Lake Kutzadikaa community was 
1
among those surveyed. As a result of the petition, 
2
Congress began to appropriate funding for the pur-
3
chase of lands in California for the ‘‘homeless Indi-
4
ans’’. 
5
(5) In 1907, historical members of the Tribe 
6
were issued individual allotted lands near Mono 
7
Lake under the General Allotment Act. In accord-
8
ance to the General Allotment Act, allotted lands 
9
were only provided to Indians shown to be recog-
10
nized or entitled to be recognized members of an 
11
‘‘Indian tribe’’. The Federal Government determined 
12
that Mono Lake Kutzadikaa members met this cri-
13
teria. 
14
(6) In the early 1920s, the Los Angeles Depart-
15
ment of Water and Power began purchasing lands 
16
throughout Inyo and Mono Counties in its effort to 
17
secure a reliable water supply for the expanding city 
18
of Los Angeles in southern California. The Mono 
19
Lake Kutzadikaa allottees were not immune to the 
20
pressures of Los Angeles Department of Water and 
21
Power and were encouraged to sell their land, which 
22
most did. However, Tribal members remained at 
23
Mono Lake working and living on local farms and in 
24

some cases squatting on Los Angeles Department of 
1
Water and Power or other Federal lands. 
2
(7) Although Tribal members were once again 
3
landless, they remained under the jurisdiction of the 
4
Federal Government and appeared on the Bureau of 
5
Indian Affairs census records, their children at-
6
tended Bureau of Indian Affairs boarding schools, 
7
and members received (and do today) health care 
8
services, and other Federal benefits and services. 
9
(8) Federal representatives worked with the 
10
Tribe to no avail in the 1920s and 1930s to secure 
11
a land base, and these efforts are well documented 
12
in official Bureau of Indian Affairs correspondence 
13
and records. 
14
(9) In June 1950, Tribal members submitted a 
15
petition to the Committee on Interior and Insular 
16
Affairs and the Subcommittee on Indian Affairs, re-
17
questing an investigation into their living conditions. 
18
In the petition, they stated that they hoped that 
19
through an investigation, the agencies might ‘‘appro-
20
priate, rehabilitate, or set aside land for us’’. H.R. 
21
Muskrat, a Bureau of Indian Affairs field represent-
22
ative who investigated the conditions of Tribal mem-
23
bers, reported to J.M. Stewart, the Bureau of Indian 
24
Affairs Area Director for California, that there were 
25
02:28 Jun 26, 2021

•HR 3649 IH
no public lands available for the Tribe or its mem-
1
bers, and all water resources were owned by the Los 
2
Angeles Department of Water and Power. 
3
(10) On December 26, 1950, a formal petition 
4
was filed before the Indian Claims Commission on 
5
behalf of the Northern Paiute Nation, which in-
6
cluded various individual Northern Paiute Indians 
7
and several reservation tribes, all located in Nevada. 
8
The original claim, designated as Docket No. 87, did 
9
not include California Paiute tribes from the Owens 
10
Valley, Mono Lake, Deep Springs Valley, or Fish 
11
Lake Valley. During the course of the liability phase 
12
of the trial, expert testimony was introduced cor-
13
recting the oversight, and on August 8, 1951, an 
14
amended petition was filed that included the Tribe 
15
and other overlooked California Paiute Nations. Un-
16
fortunately, the Commission awarded only meager 
17
compensation to individual members and did not 
18
provide lands to the Tribe. 
19
(11) In 1955, the Tribe submitted a petition to 
20
State Senator Charles Brown of Sacramento, Cali-
21
fornia, seeking to establish a reservation that in-
22
cluded 66,000 acres of land. The petition rested on 
23
a 1912 Presidential Executive order that had set 
24
aside lands for the Tribe and other tribes in Inyo 
25

and Mono County, but was later withdrawn because 
1
the original land identified was unsuitable. The 
2
Tribe’s petition was again met with the statement 
3
that there was no land available for a reservation. 
4
(12) Believing that recognition might lead to 
5
land for the Tribe, the Tribe submitted a letter of 
6
‘‘Intent to Petition for Recognition’’ in 1976 to the 
7
Office of Federal Acknowledgment and began work-
8
ing on a petition for recognition, an effort that con-
9
tinues today. 
10
(13) In 1977, the Tribe adopted formal Articles 
11
of Association to define its enrollment criteria and 
12
election of Tribal leaders. 
13
(14) Also in 1977, the Tribe petitioned and was 
14
recognized by the BIA as an ‘‘adult Indian commu-
15
nity of one-half degree of Indian blood’’ under the 
16
Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 (25 U.S.C. 5101 
17
et seq.). However, the Bureau of Indian Affairs 
18
made clear that this status did not give Federal rec-
19
ognition to the Tribe. The status did solidify that 
20
Tribal members were recognized as ‘‘Indians’’ and 
21
entitled to Federal benefits and services. 
22
(15) Even without formal Tribal recognition, 
23
the Tribe has remained a political force and the pro-
24
tector of Mono Lake, Kutzapaa’ which is at the cen-

ter of the Tribe’s culture and history and provided 
1
its ancestors with a critical food source. On March 
2
19, 1983, Jessie Durant, a revered Tribal elder, tes-
3
tified before the Subcommittee on Public Lands and 
4
National Parks on the importance of Mono Lake to 
5
the Mono Lake people and culture. Mono Lake is 
6
now known as the Mono Lake Tufa State Natural 
7
Reserve thanks in large part to the efforts of the 
8
Tribe and the Mono Lake Foundation. 
9
(16) On April 28, 1989, the Senate Select Com-
10
mittee on Indian Affairs held hearings in Sac-
11
ramento, California, on SB 611, a bill to Establish 
12
Administrative Procedures to Determine Status of 
13
Certain Indian Groups. Tribal member Richard 
14
Blaver was invited to and provided testimony on be-
15
half of the Tribe on the difficulties encountered by 
16
tribes seeking recognition through the Bureau of In-
17
dian Affairs’ administrative acknowledgment proc-
18
ess. 
19
(17) The Federal agencies that now manage 
20
Federal lands, some of which are the ancestral lands 
21
of the Tribe, share a deep respect for the Tribe, and 
22
acknowledge that the Kutzadikaa members are the 
23
aboriginal people of the Mono Basin. Small examples 
24
can be seen from the Forest Service, that in 1991 
25
02:28 Jun 26, 2021
H3649

•HR 3649 IH
worked with the Tribe in protecting the Tribe’s ‘‘In-
1
dian’’ cemetery located in part on Forest Service 
2
lands. 
3
(18) In 1993, the Forest Service hosted a dedi-
4
cation in honor of the elders of the Kutzadikaa Tribe 
5
by setting aside a grove of Jeffrey pine trees for tra-
6
ditional purposes and designated the area as the 
7
Piaga Park. The Forest Service specifically dedi-
8
cated the trees in ‘‘honor of the Mono Lake 
9
[Kutzadikaa] Elders who have historically harvested 
10
the [Piaga] from the area’’. 
11
(19) In 1996, the National Park Service issued 
12
a directive to all Yosemite Entrance Station per-
13
sonnel informing them that members of the Tribe 
14
were to be granted entrance to the Yosemite Na-
15
tional Park at no cost. More recent examples are the 
16
ongoing Federal, State, and county agencies con-
17
sultations with the Tribe on proposed environmental 
18
projects, land management planning, and repatri-
19
ation of Tribal funerary objects and artifacts under 
20
the Native American Graves Protection and Repatri-
21
ation Act when encountered on Federal lands. 
22
(20) In 2000, the Tribe partnered with the 
23
Mono County Board of Supervisors to seek funding 
24
to assist the county in completing a community cen-
25

ter in Lee Vining, California. The Tribe was award-
1
ed a State Community Development Block Grant 
2
from the California Native American Allocation for 
3
$475,000, which was used to complete construction 
4
of the community center. In exchange for this con-
5
tribution, the county has dedicated office space to 
6
the Tribe and a large meeting room for Tribal gen-
7
eral council meetings, and the building is identified 
8
as the ‘‘Mono Lake Indian and Lee Vining Commu-
9
nity Center’’. 
10
(21) In 2003, the Tribe adopted a Constitution 
11
and other governing documents to formalize its Trib-
12
al Government structure, enrollment process, and 
13
elections of its leaders. Even without Federal finan-
14
cial assistance to carry out its governmental func-
15
tions or a land base, the Tribe remains a distinct 
16
community both politically and culturally. The Tribe 
17
works with its Federal, State, and county agency 
18
partners to protect cultural and sacred sites, the en-
19
vironment, Mono Lake, and habitat. In recent years, 
20
the Tribe has established the ‘‘Mono Lake/Yosemite 
21
Traditional Walk’’, which is the revitalization of the 
22
walk their ancestors took from Mono Lake to Yo-
23
semite in order to trade with and engage with family 
24
and neighboring tribes. The Tribe celebrates and 
25

honors their elders and veterans through community 
1
events and Tribal functions on an annual basis. 
2
(22) Federal recognition of the Tribe through 
3
this Act is supported by the Mono County Board of 
4
Supervisors, all five federally recognized Tribes in 
5
Inyo County, the non-federally recognized tribe 
6
Southern Sierra Muwuk Nation, and the federally 
7
recognized tribes of Tuolumne Band of Me-Wuk In-
8
dians, Picayune Rancheria of the Chuckansi Tribe, 
9
and the North Fork Rancheria of Mono Indians. 
10
Support also comes from the National Park Service, 
11
the Sierra Club, Friends of Inyo County, the An-
12
thropology Department of California State Univer-
13
sity Chico, California Indian Legal Services, and 
14
other organizations.
