RESOLUTION 
Calling upon all Americans on this Memorial Day, 2021, 
to honor the men and women of the Armed Forces 
who have died in the pursuit of freedom and peace.

has always been a valued objective of this Nation; 
Whereas hundreds of thousands of United States men and 
women have selflessly given their lives in sacrifice in serv-
ice as peacemakers and peacekeepers;

the appreciation and gratitude these patriots deserve and 
to commemorate the ultimate sacrifice they made in serv-
ice to our Nation; and 
Whereas Memorial Day is the day of the year to remember 
the sacrifices made by these defenders who now lie in hal-
lowed ground throughout the world and serves as an ex-
pression of our faith in democracy, our faith in our val-
ues, and our faith that those who fight for freedom will 
defeat those whose cause is unjust: Now, therefore, be it
