their communities safe.

(2) Public safety officers, including police offi-

12
safety officers develop behavioral health conditions

15
20 percent of the general population that develops

1
Law Enforcement Mental Health and Wellness Act 
2
of 2017 (Public Law 115–113; 131 Stat. 2276), the 
3
Director of the Office of Community Oriented Polic-
4
ing Services of the Department of Justice developed 
5
a report (referred to in this section as the

‘‘LEMHWA report’’) that expressed that many law 
7
enforcement agencies do not have the capacity or 
8
local access to the mental health professionals nec-
9
essary for treating their law enforcement officers.

(9) The LEMHWA report recommended meth-
11
ods for establishing remote access or regional mental 
12
health check programs at the State or Federal level. 
13
(10) Individual police and fire departments gen-
14
erally do not have the resources to employ full-time 
15
mental health experts who are able to treat public 
16
safety officers with state-of-the-art techniques for 
17
the purpose of treating job-related post-traumatic 
18
stress disorder and acute stress disorder.
