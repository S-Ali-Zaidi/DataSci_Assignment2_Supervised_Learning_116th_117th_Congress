RESOLUTION 
To express the support of the House of Representatives 
that no governmental entity should designate what jobs 
are deemed essential and nonessential. 
Whereas government entities determined which businesses 
could remain open during the COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas this intervention prevented Americans from earning 
a paycheck to support themselves; 
Whereas these actions forced many workers onto government 
programs instead of working wage paying jobs; 
Whereas no one should exchange the ability to earn a pay-
check for dependence on government;

Whereas any job that provides a paycheck to cover living ex-
penses is essential for the individual; 
Whereas many businesses were never able to recover from 
these forced closures; 
Whereas the government should never be picking winners or 
losers; and 
Whereas the United States of America was built on the foun-
dation of individual liberties including the ability to work 
and earn a living: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives ex-
1
presses the following: 
2
(1) Every job that delivers a paycheck to cover 
3
living expenses is essential. 
4
(2) No Federal, State, or local government

should deem what businesses have the right to oper-

ate and which must close.
