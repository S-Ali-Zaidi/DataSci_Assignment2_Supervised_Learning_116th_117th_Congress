A BILL 
To support the development of limited equity cooperatives 
in the United States, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Affordable CO-OP

(Collective Opportunities for Owning Property) Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

The Congress finds the following:

•HR 7697 IH
(1) Limited equity cooperative housing stems 
1
from the premise that housing should provide shel-
2
ter, not a speculative opportunity. Residents pur-
3
chase a below market-rate ‘‘equity’’ share of the co-
4
operative corporation that owns the property of the 
5
cooperative and residents are charged affordable 
6
monthly carrying charges. The amount the share 
7
price increases over time is limited by the coopera-
8
tive by-laws, creating an affordable entry point into 
9
housing that stays affordable over time. Members 
10
can sell their equity share at a specific rate to main-
11
tain affordability over a longer time period. In this 
12
way, limited equity cooperatives provide an impor-
13
tant form of affordable homeownership and foster 
14
community among shareholders. 
15
(2) Over 1.5 million families and seniors benefit 
16
from cooperative housing models in the United 
17
States. There are over 200,000 units of limited eq-
18
uity housing units across the Nation. Limited equity 
19
cooperatives range in size, from single family de-
20
tached cooperative structures to dense, mixed-use, 
21
multi-family models. 
22
(3) The largest limited equity housing coopera-
23
tive in North America is Co-op City, located in the 
24
Bronx, New York. Co-op City provides over 44,000

residents with affordable, democratically controlled 
1
housing in an increasingly expensive region. This 
2
community can serve as a model for the nation on 
3
how to build and sustain decommodified housing and 
4
homeownership opportunities for those who are dis-
5
proportionately exploited by the traditional housing 
6
market, banking, and credit system, including Black 
7
and brown households, low-income households, sen-
8
iors, and people with disabilities. 
9
(4) Limited equity cooperatives do not enjoy 
10
strong Federal support relative to other forms of 
11
homeownership.
