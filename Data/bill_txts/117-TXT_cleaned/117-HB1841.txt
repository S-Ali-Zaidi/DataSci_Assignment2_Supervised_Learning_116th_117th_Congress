•HR 1841 IH
(B) access health care and essential serv-
1
ices, obtain education, and build careers;

(2) digital exclusion—

4
cost;

(B) materially harms the opportunity of an 
6
individual with respect to the economic success, 
7

8
comes, social inclusion, and civic engagement of

11
gaps, especially those experienced by covered 
12
populations; 
13

15
vestment and research efforts;

tribal, territorial, and local governments, have made 
18
social, legal, and economic obligations that nec-
19
essarily extend to how the citizens and residents of 
20
those governments access and use the internet; and 
21
(5) achieving digital equity is a matter of social 
22
and economic justice and is worth pursuing.
