(1) climate change most severely impacts vul-
1
nerable and disadvantaged communities in the 
2
United States and around the world; 
3
(2) it is the responsibility of the United States 
4
Government to work with its global partners to pro-
5
mote environmental justice and climate justice; 
6
(3) the report of the United Nations Environ-
7
ment Programme entitled ‘‘Climate Change and the 
8
Cost of Capital in Developing Countries’’, dated May 
9
2018, found that, in the 10 years prior to the publi-
10
cation of the report, climate vulnerability has cost 
11
the 20 nations most affected by catastrophes rooted 
12
in climate change an additional $62,000,000,000 in 
13
interest payments alone; 
14
(4) individuals and families, particularly com-
15
munities of color, indigenous communities, and low- 
16
income communities, that are on the frontlines of 
17
climate change across the globe are often in close 
18
proximity to environmental stressors or sources of 
19
pollution; 
20
(5) the communities described in paragraph 
21
(4)—

causes and impacts of climate change; and

(B) have the fewest resources with which

to mitigate those impacts or to relocate; 
2
(6) all efforts to adapt to and mitigate climate

change must include specific protections for and ac-
4
knowledgment of the harm of climate change to 
5
communities of color, indigenous peoples, women, 
6
and other frontline communities and marginalized 
7
peoples around the world; 
8
(7) in Paris, on December 12, 2015, the parties 
9
to the United Nations Framework Convention on 
10
Climate Change adopted the Paris Agreement, a 
11
benchmark agreement— 
12
(A) to combat climate change; and 
13
(B) to accelerate and intensify the actions 
14
and investments needed for a sustainable low 
15
carbon future; 
16
(8) the Paris Agreement, to which the United 
17
States is a party, acknowledges, ‘‘Parties should, 
18
when taking action to address climate change, re-
19
spect, promote and consider their respective obliga-
20

2
(9) the Paris Agreement— 
3
(A) notes the importance of ‘‘climate jus-
4
tice’’ when mitigating and adapting to climate 
5
change; and 
6
(B) recognizes ‘‘the need for an effective 
7
and progressive response to the urgent threat of 
8
climate change’’; 
9
(10) it is imperative for all countries to under-
10
take mitigation activities to rapidly meet the goal of 
11
limiting global warming to not more than 1.5 de-
12
grees Celsius; 
13
(11) developed countries have the greatest ca-
14
pacity to mitigate their greenhouse gas emissions, 
15
while— 
16
(A) developing countries have the least ca-
17
pacity to engage in mitigation activities; and 
18
(B) the capacity of developing countries to 
19
engage in mitigation activities is less than the 
20
national mitigation potential of those developing 
21
countries; 
22
(12) the determination for the fair share of 
23
mitigation and adaptation activities for each country 
24
must take into account—

(A) the historic greenhouse gas emissions

of each country; and 
2
(B) the current capacity of each country to 
3
both mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and 
4
adapt to climate impacts; 
5
(13) developed countries that have historically 
6
emitted a disproportionately high share of green-
7
house gas emissions, and reaped the economic bene-
8
fits of those polluting activities, have a cor-
9
responding disproportionately greater responsibility 
10
to engage in global mitigation and adaptation activi-
11
ties, as compared to less industrialized countries 
12
that have historically polluted far less; 
13
(14) the only realistic way for less industri-
14
alized countries to meet their full mitigation poten-
15
tial is through international climate financing by 
16
more developed countries; 
17
(15) in the 2009 Copenhagen Accord, developed 
18
countries committed to jointly mobilize, starting in 
19
2020, $100,000,000,000 per year in public climate 
20
financing (as well as private investment and other 
21
alternative forms of finance), for developing coun-
22
tries, a commitment reaffirmed in 2015 in Decision

2
(16) the $100,000,000,000 commitment de-
3
scribed in paragraph (15) was a political com-
4
promise that falls short of the actual financing needs

for climate action in developing countries;

(17) Bloomberg New Energy Finance has esti-

mated that the transition to renewable energy

11
gramme has estimated that adaptation needs relat-
12
ing to climate change in developing countries may be 
13
as much as $300,000,000,000 annually by 2030; 
14
(19) the Green Climate Fund was created in

2010 by 194 countries to serve as a crucial financ-
16
ing mechanism to help developing countries limit or

Green Climate Fund, though only 1⁄3 of this pledge

of the Green Climate Fund (‘‘GCF–1’’), covering the

22
combat climate change; and 
23
(2) that—

oped by recipient countries and communities; 
4
(C) is designed and implemented with the 
5
free, prior, and informed consent of indigenous 
6
peoples and other impacted communities; 
7
(D) promotes gender equality as essential

by climate financing;

(E) includes best practices for environ-
11
mental and social safeguards to ensure that 
12
projects and programs supported by climate fi-
13
nancing respect fundamental human rights; and

(F) addresses both mitigation and adapta-
15
tion as essential aspects of responding to cli-
