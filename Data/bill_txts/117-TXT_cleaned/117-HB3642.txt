A BILL 
To award a Congressional gold medal to the 369th Infantry 
Regiment, 
commonly 
known 
as 
the 
‘‘Harlem 
Hellfighters’’, in recognition of their bravery and out-
standing service during World War I. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Harlem Hellfighters 
4
Congressional Gold Medal Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) When the United States officially entered 
8
World War I in April 1917, the Armed Forces were 
9
still segregated, even though African-American sol-
10
diers had served and distinguished themselves in 
11
every war since the Revolutionary War, and even the 
12
Colonial Wars preceding the American Revolution. 
13
(2) After several years of advocacy and debate, 
14
in 1916 the State of New York authorized the re-
15
cruitment of the 15th New York National Guard 
16
Regiment, which was called to Federal service on 
17
July 25, 1917, soon after arriving for training at 
18
Camp Whitman, New York. 
19
(3) The 15th completed its basic military prac-
20
tice training at Camp Whitman, New York.

(4) To receive combat training, the 15th re-
1
ported, on October 8, 1917, to Camp Wadsworth, in 
2
Spartanburg, South Carolina, where it experienced 
3
many incidents of racial discrimination. 
4
(5) Consequently, the government agreed to re-
5
move the 15th from Camp Wadsworth, but, instead 
6
of receiving further training, the regiment began 
7
preparing for deployment to France in November. 
8
(6) The 15th arrived in Saint Nazaire, France, 
9
on January 1, 1918, where it was redesignated the 
10
369th Infantry Regiment. 
11
(7) Partly because many White soldiers within 
12
the American Expeditionary Forces (hereinafter, the 
13
‘‘AEF’’) refused to perform combat duty with Black 
14
soldiers, members of the 369th were initially as-
15
signed manual labor tasks, such as loading and un-
16
loading supplies, and constructing roads and rail-
17
roads. 
18
(8) After receiving pressure from the 369th reg-
19
imental commander about not having a combat mis-
20
sion, the AEF attached the 369th to the French 
21
Fourth Army. 
22
(9) By mid-March of 1918, the 369th went to 
23
the Argonne Forest with the French 16th Division 
24
for training and soon entered the trenches.

(10) The 369th encountered its first German 
1
soldiers in combat in April, 1918. 
2
(11) In May of 1918, Private Henry Johnson 
3
of the 369th received the French Croix de Guerre, 
4
with Palm, for extraordinary valor, becoming one of 
5
the first American soldiers to be awarded this honor. 
6
(12) Johnson also belatedly received a Purple 
7
Heart, was awarded the Distinguished Service 
8
Cross, and in, 2015, was awarded the Medal of 
9
Honor. 
10
(13) Throughout the remainder of the spring 
11
and into the summer the 369th served at Minacourt, 
12
in the Champagne-Marne Defensive, and during the 
13
Aisne-Marne Offensive in support of the French 
14
161st Infantry Division. 
15
(14) As summer turned to autumn, the 369th 
16
went on to participate in the Meuse-Argonne offen-
17
sive, where it captured the important village of 
18
Sechault despite sustaining severe losses. 
19
(15) On October 14, 1918, the 369th advanced 
20
to Alsace. 
21
(16) On November 20, 1918, the 369th reached 
22
the banks of the Rhine River as part of the French 
23
Army of Occupation, the first Allied unit to do so.

(17) The 369th was relieved of its assignment 
1
with the French 161st Division in December, 1918, 
2
and elements of the regiment sailed for New York 
3
in late January and early February, 1919. 
4
(18) The 369th Infantry Regiment received a 
5
parade up 5th Avenue in New York City on Feb-
6
ruary 17, 1919, receiving applause and cheers from 
7
hundreds of thousands of onlookers. 
8
(19) The 369th was demobilized on February 
9
28, 1919. 
10
(20) Over 170 individual members of the 369th 
11
received the Croix de Guerre, many were awarded 
12
the Distinguished Service Cross, and the 369th was 
13
awarded a unit citation. 
14
(21) It is generally believed that the 369th was 
15
dubbed the ‘‘Harlem Hellfighters’’ by German sol-
16
diers, who found the men to be incredibly deter-
17
mined and courageous in battle. 
18
(22) The 369th was the first regiment of Afri-
19
can Americans to deploy overseas during World War 
20
I and spent 191 days on the front line in World War 
21
I, more than any other American regimental sized 
22
unit.

(23) The 369th never lost a foot of ground nor 
1
had a man taken prisoner, despite suffering a high 
2
number of casualties.
