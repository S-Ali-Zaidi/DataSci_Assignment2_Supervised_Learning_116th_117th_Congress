4
Act of 2021’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
The Congress finds as follows:

•HR 125 IH
(1) There is nearly one mass shooting per day 
1
in the United States—355 mass shootings in 2015. 
2
(2) In December 2012, a gunman walked into 
3
Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Con-
4
necticut, and killed 20 children, 6 adults, and him-
5
self. 
6
(3) Since December 2012, there have been at 
7
least 1,518 mass shootings, with at least 1,715 peo-
8
ple killed and 6,089 wounded. 
9
(4) On the night of October 1, 2017, a gunman 
10
opened fire on a large crowd of concertgoers at the 
11
Route 91 Harvest music festival on the Las Vegas 
12
Strip, leaving 58 people dead and 527 injured. 
13
(5) Every day, on average, 92 Americans are 
14
victims of gun violence, resulting in more than 
15
33,000 deaths annually. 
16
(6) States with higher gun ownership rates have 
17
higher gun murder rates—as much as 114 percent 
18
higher than States with lower gun ownership rates. 
19
(7) A recent study by the Centers for Disease 
20
Control and Prevention looking at 30 years of homi-
21
cide data found that for every 1 percent increase in 
22
a State’s gun ownership rate, there is a nearly 1 
23
percent increase in its firearm homicide rate.

•HR 125 IH
(8) Gun death rates are generally lower in 
1
States with restrictions such as safe storage require-
2
ments or assault weapons bans. 
3
(9) Mass shootings stopped by armed civilians 
4
in the past 33 years: 0. 
5
(10) Because more than 75 percent of the 
6
weapons used in mass shootings between 1982 and 
7
2012 were obtained legally, stronger legislation is 
8
needed to prevent guns from getting into the wrong 
9
hands.
