RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
it is the duty of Congress to uphold the Constitution 
and principles on which the United States of America 
was founded and that nothing in the Constitution or 
Declaration of Independence is meant to be construed 
as racist or harmful. 
Whereas it is the duty of Congress to uphold the Constitution 
and principles on which the United States of America 
was founded; 
Whereas no idea in the Constitution, Declaration of Inde-
pendence, or Bill of Rights is meant to be construed as 
racist;

Whereas the principles contained in America’s founding docu-
ments actually served as a force for liberation and not 
tyranny; 
Whereas this idea is premised on the fact that abolitionists 
and proponents for civil rights continually cited these 
founding documents as inspiration in their struggle 
against repression; 
Whereas the society of the United States is built on the 
ideals of equality, tolerance, and acceptance; 
Whereas the National Archives and Records Administration 
recently put a ‘‘harmful content’’ warning label on the 
founding documents of the United States; 
Whereas this type of censorship showcases a frightening igno-
rance of the true history of the United States; 
Whereas Congress is proud of the founding documents and 
the freedom guaranteed to Americans within these docu-
ments; 
Whereas all Americans should be grateful for the sacrifices 
of those who gave their lives in defense of the Constitu-
tion and the spread of freedom; and 
Whereas this censorship betrays the harmful nature of pro-
gressive skepticism of American exceptionalism: Now, 
therefore, be it
