A BILL 
To require the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to distribute 
an optional and anonymous survey to certain Commission 
employees to ultimately find solutions to improve the 
efficiency and effectiveness of the Commission, and for 
other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Nuclear Regulatory 
4
Commission Survey Act’’ or the ‘‘NRC Survey Act’’.

SEC. 2. NRC SURVEY.

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:

•HR 9351 IH
(1) The Commission is an independent agency 
1
created by Congress in 1974 to ensure the safe use 
2
of radioactive materials and nuclear power for bene-
3
ficial civilian purposes while protecting people and 
4
the environment. 
5
(2) The mission of the Commission is to regu-
6
late the national civilian use of nuclear byproducts, 
7
nuclear sources, and special nuclear materials to en-
8
sure adequate protection of public health and safety, 
9
to promote the common defense and security, and to 
10
protect the environment. 
11
(3) Before commercial nuclear technology can 
12
be deployed in the United States, it must be ap-
13
proved by the Commission. 
14
(4) Historically, the Commission has been a 
15
thorough, methodical, and conservative agency and 
16
is considered to be the gold standard in the world 
17
with respect to regulating nuclear power. 
18
(5) The Commission is a technically competent 
19
agency that seeks strategies to successfully mod-
20
ernize its approach to license the next generation of 
21
nuclear reactors. 
22
(6) Current licensing procedures through the 
23
Commission are very prescriptive and based pri-
24
marily on conventional pressurized water reactor de-
25
21:30 Nov 25, 2022
H9351

•HR 9351 IH
signs that have the potential to restrict nuclear inno-
1
vation. 
2
(7) The existing design, licensing, and delivery 
3
processes for new reactor projects are extremely ex-
4
pensive and have lengthy timelines compared to such 
5
design, licensing, and delivery processes in other 
6
countries. 
7
(8) The Commission reports directly to Con-
8
gress each year and is an independent agency that 
9
is not a part of the executive branch. 
10
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
11
gress that Congress— 
12
(1) recognizes the need for the Commission to 
13
maintain public trust by keeping the nuclear indus-
14
try safe while also recognizing the need for increased 
15
efficiency to license nuclear reactors in the United 
16
States; 
17
(2) understands that asking for continued 
18
transparency from the Commission relating to the 
19
development and licensing of nuclear reactors is im-
20
portant for Congress and the American public; 
21
(3) stresses the need for the Commission to 
22
modernize its regulatory regime to facilitate efficient 
23
licensing of innovative next-generation nuclear tech-
24
nology; and 
25
21:30 Nov 25, 2022
H9351
4 
•HR 9351 IH
(4) believes that unnecessarily long licensing re-
1
views raise significant barriers to investment, reduce 
2
customer interest in advanced reactors, and threaten 
3
the long-term deployment potential of nuclear reac-
4
tors for the next generation.

(c) NRC EMPLOYEE SURVEY.— 
6
(1) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 60 days after 
7
the date of enactment of this Act, the inspector gen-
8
eral shall draft and distribute an optional and anon-
9
ymous survey, in accordance with paragraphs (3) 
10
and (4), to covered employees. 
11
(2) REPORT.—Not later than 60 days after the 
12
date of distributing the survey to covered employees 
13
pursuant to paragraph (1), the inspector general 
14
shall submit to the appropriate congressional com-
15
mittees a report containing— 
16
(A) an unbiased cumulative summary of 
17
the responses to each question of such survey;

19
vidual response to each question of such survey;

ed and distributed under paragraph (1) shall inquire 
2
about the following: 
3

10
Reactor Safeguards (established under section 
11
29 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 
12

13
viewing safety studies and licensing applica-
14
tions, or whether the role of the Advisory Com-
15
mittee on Reactor Safeguards— 
16
(i) is unnecessary and redundant with
