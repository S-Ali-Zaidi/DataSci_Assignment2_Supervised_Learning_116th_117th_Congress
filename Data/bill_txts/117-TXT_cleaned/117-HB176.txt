‘‘(a) IN GENERAL.—Any placement of an inmate in

10
be insufficient to reduce this risk. 
11
The correctional facility shall bear the burden of es-
12
tablishing this standard by clear and convincing evi-
13
dence before any agency review. An inmate who 
14
would create a substantial risk of immediate serious

17
ical reason shall be placed in an appropriate medical

22
confinement before receiving a personal and com-
23
prehensive medical and mental health examination 
24
conducted by a clinician. A preliminary examination

shall be conducted by a member of the medical staff

confinement pursuant to initial procedures and re-
5
views which provide timely, fair and meaningful op-
6
portunities for the inmate to contest the confinement 
7
in such an administrative proceeding as the Director 
8
shall establish. These procedures shall include— 
9
‘‘(A) the right to an initial hearing within 
10
72 hours of placement and a review every 15 
11
days thereafter, in the absence of exceptional 
12
circumstances, unavoidable delays, or reason-
13
able postponements;

15
‘‘(C) the right to be represented at the 
16
