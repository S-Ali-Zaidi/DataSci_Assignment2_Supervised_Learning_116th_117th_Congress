(1) Under section 2576a of title 10, United

2
ized to provide excess property to local law enforce-
3
ment agencies. The Defense Logistics Agency, ad-
4
ministers such section by operating the Law En-
5
forcement Support Office program. 
6
(2) New and used material, including mine-re-
7
sistant ambush-protected vehicles and weapons de-
8
termined by the Department of Defense to be ‘‘mili-
9
tary grade’’ are transferred to Federal, Tribal, 
10
State, and local law enforcement agencies through

13
including police and sheriff’s departments, are ac-
14
quiring this material for use in their normal oper-
15
ations.

those wars has become excess property and has been 
19
made available for transfer to local and Federal law

3
through the program.

instituted a moratorium on weapons transfers

through the program after reports of missing equip-
7
ment and inappropriate weapons transfers.

18
controls were inadequate to prevent fraudulent appli-
19
cants’ access to the program.
