A BILL 
To amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide 
for Medicare coverage of multi-cancer early detection 
screening tests. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Medicare Multi-Cancer

Early Detection Screening Coverage Act of 2021’’.

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:

•HR 1946 IH
(1) Detecting cancer early, before it has spread 
1
throughout the body, saves lives. Cancers detected 
2
when still localized can be treated more effectively 
3
and have a 5-year cancer specific survival of ap-
4
proximately 90 percent compared with approximately 
5
20 percent for cancers found after metastasis has 
6
occurred. Existing Medicare-covered early detection 
7
tests such as mammograms and colonoscopies, have 
8
led to a substantial reduction in age-adjusted mor-
9
tality. 
10
(2) Diagnosing and treating cancer earlier often 
11
results in less invasive treatments for patients, 
12
which are also less expensive. According to peer re-
13
viewed literature, treatment of metastatic cancer is 
14
two times more costly than treatment of cancer be-
15
fore it metastasizes. 
16
(3) Driving national strategies to broadly detect 
17
cancer earlier will help reduce pervasive health dis-
18
parities since racial, ethnic, and geographic groups 
19
experience later stages of diagnosis, along with high-
20
er cancer incidence and mortality. 
21
(4) The benefits of early cancer detection to 
22
Medicare beneficiaries has been limited to five can-
23
cers. According to the National Cancer Institute’s 
24
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results pro-

gram, 71 percent of the 600,000 cancer deaths each 
1
year are from types of cancer without a Medicare- 
2
covered early detection test. 
3
(5) Age is the leading risk factor for cancer, 
4
placing Medicare beneficiaries at elevated risk. 
5
Americans who are 65 years of age and older are 
6
more than 7 times as likely as Americans who are 
7
under 65 years of age to be diagnosed with cancer. 
8
(6) Several innovative private and academic ef-
9
forts are engaged in research, including advanced 
10
clinical trials to develop multi-cancer early detection 
11
blood-based tests. Published data indicate that these 
12
tests can screen for many cancers at the same time, 
13
including rare cancers, with one example currently 
14
able to screen for more than 50 cancers. 
15
(7) Multi-cancer early detection tests can com-
16
plement the covered early detection tests enacted by 
17
Congress and extend the benefits of early detection 
18
to more cancers and more Americans. Medicare cov-
19
erage of comprehensive multi-cancer early detection 
20
screening tests could substantially transform cancer 
21
care for Americans, and the Medicare law needs 
22
modernizing to provide timely coverage and keep 
23
pace with medical innovation.
