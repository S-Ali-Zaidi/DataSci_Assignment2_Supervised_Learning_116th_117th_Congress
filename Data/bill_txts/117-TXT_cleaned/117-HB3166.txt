SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The National Association of School Nurses 
3
identifies schools as primary locations to address 
4
student health issues, since a school nurse is the 
5
health care provider that many students see on the 
6
most regular basis. 
7
(2) The American Academy of Pediatrics has 
8
recognized the crucial role that school nurses play in 
9
children’s health and has called for having a full- 
10
time school nurse every day and in every school 
11
building. 
12
(3) The school nurse functions as the leader 
13
and coordinator of the school health services team, 
14
including by carrying out chronic disease manage-
15
ment and health promotion as well as facilitating ac-
16
cess to a medical home for each child and supporting 
17
academic achievement. 
18
(4) School nurses promote wellness and disease 
19
prevention to improve health outcomes for our Na-
20
tion’s children. In addition, school nurses perform 
21
early intervention services such as periodic assess-
22
ments for vision, hearing, and dental problems, in an 
23
effort to remove barriers to learning. 
24
(5) The American Federation of Teachers has 
25
called for a nurse in every school, as nurses are 
26

•HR 3166 IH
front-line workers that address an array of health 
1
needs and their presence in a school can help to im-
2
prove student learning. 
3
(6) According to 2017 data from the National 
4
Association of School Nurses, only 39.3 percent of 
5
schools employ a full-time school nurse, while 35.5 
6
percent of schools employ a school nurse only part- 
7
time, and 25.2 percent do not have a school nurse 
8
at all. 
9
(7) The National Association of School Nurses 
10
has reported that medication administration to stu-
11
dents is one of the most common health-related ac-
12
tivities performed in school. As more chronically ill 
13
and medically unstable children enter the school sys-
14
tem each year, the medical factors that promote and 
15
support their academic success increase, including 
16
the need for medications that enhance overall health 
17
or stabilize chronic conditions. 
18
(8) National data indicate that between 15 and 
19
20 percent of children who spend their day in school 
20
have a chronic health condition. 
21
(9) According to the American Academy of Pe-
22
diatrics, students today face increased social and 
23
emotional issues, which enhance the need for preven-
24
tive services and interventions for acute and chronic 
25

health issues. School nurses are actively engaged 
1
members of school-based mental health teams and 
2
spend nearly 32 percent of their time providing men-
3
tal health services, including universal and targeted 
4
interventions, screenings to identify early warning 
5
signs and provide referrals to medical providers, and 
6
crisis planning. 
7
(10) According to the Department of Edu-
8
cation, during the 2013–2014 school year, 1,360,747 
9
children enrolled in public schools experienced home-
10
lessness. Homeless children develop increased rates 
11
of acute and chronic health conditions, and the 
12
stress of their living situation can negatively affect 
13
their development and ability to learn. As a result, 
14
schools have become the primary access to health 
15
care for many children and adolescents. School 
16
nurses serve on the front lines as a safety net for 
17
the Nation’s most vulnerable children. 
18
(11) Communicable and infectious diseases ac-
19
count for millions of school days lost each year. 
20
Data illustrate that when students have access to a 
21
registered nurse in school, immunization rates in-
22
crease. 
23
(12) Throughout the COVID–19 pandemic, 
24
school nurses have played an important role helping

students and coordinating activities such as contact
