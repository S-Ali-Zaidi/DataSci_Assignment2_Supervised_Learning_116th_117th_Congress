(1) DENY.—The term ‘‘deny’’ means to use 
1
combined joint operations to delay, degrade, and ul-
2
timately defeat an attempt by the People’s Republic 
3
of China to execute a fait accompli against Taiwan, 
4
resulting in— 
5
(A) the termination of hostilities or at 
6
least the attempted fait accompli; or 
7
(B) the neutralization of the ability of the 
8
People’s Republic of China to execute a fait 
9
accompli against Taiwan. 
10
(2) FAIT ACCOMPLI.—The term ‘‘fait accompli’’ 
11
refers to the strategy of the People’s Republic of 
12
China for invading and seizing control of Taiwan be-
13
fore the United States Armed Forces can respond 
14
effectively, while simultaneously deterring an effec-
15
tive combined joint response by the United States 
16
Armed Forces by convincing the United States that 
17
mounting such a response would be prohibitively dif-
18
ficult or costly.

SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
20
Congress makes the following findings: 
21
(1) Taiwan is a beacon of democracy in Asia 
22
and a steadfast partner of the United States in the 
23
common pursuit of a free and open Indo-Pacific re-
24
gion in which—

(A) all societies enjoy sovereign autonomy; 
1
(B) the people of the region live securely, 
2
prosperously, and with dignity; and 
3
(C) the societies of the region rise and fall 
4
not by coercion but on the basis of peaceful 
5
competition. 
6
(2) If the People’s Republic of China were to 
7
use military force to compel the unification of Tai-
8
wan with the People’s Republic of China— 
9
(A) the world would lose one of the great 
10
exemplars of freedom and democracy; 
11
(B) the United States and allies and part-
12
ners of the United States would face severe dif-
13
ficulty in maintaining favorable balances of 
14
power relative to the People’s Republic of China 
15
in Northeast and Southeast Asia; and 
16
(C) as the balance of power in the Indo- 
17
Pacific region shifted in favor of the People’s 
18
Republic of China, the People’s Republic of 
19
China would possess an increasing ability— 
20
(i) to impose its will throughout the 
21
Indo-Pacific region, including by threat-
22
ening or using force against Japan, South 
23
Korea, the Philippines, and other allies 
24
and partners of the United States; and

(ii) restrict United States access to 
1
key trade routes and markets in the Indo- 
2
Pacific region, thereby imposing severe 
3
economic hardship on middle-class and 
4
working-class Americans and increasing 
5
the ability of the People’s Republic of 
6
China to intrude into political life in the 
7
United States. 
8
(3) There is growing concern that the Govern-
9
ment of the People’s Republic of China may con-
10
clude that the cross-Strait military balance has tilted 
11
in its favor and launch an invasion of Taiwan sooner 
12
than previously anticipated, including as follows: 
13
(A) Former Assistant to the President for 
14
National Security Affairs H.R. McMaster testi-
15
fied in March 2020 that Taiwan is ‘‘the most 
16
significant flashpoint now’’ between the United 
17
States and the People’s Republic of China. 
18
(B) Former Commander of United States 
19
Indo-Pacific Command Admiral Phil Davidson 
20
testified in March 2020 that the threat of an 
21
invasion by the People’s Republic of China of 
22
Taiwan ‘‘is manifest during this decade, in fact 
23
in the next six years’’.

(C) Commander of United States Indo-Pa-

2
in March 2020 that the threat of an invasion 
3
by the People’s Republic of China of Taiwan is 
4
‘‘much closer to us than most think’’ and could 
5
materialize well before 2035. 
6
(4) Defense policymakers and analysts across 
7
multiple administrations have found that, if the Peo-
8
ple’s Republic of China does invade Taiwan, the in-
9
vasion will likely take the form of a fait accompli, 
10
including as follows: 
11
(A) The Defense Science Board assessed in 
12
June 2018 that the People’s Republic of China 
13
‘‘will attempt to achieve a decisive outcome very 
14
quickly, presenting the United States and its al-
15
lies with a fait accompli,’’ in the event of con-
16
flict. 
17
(B) The Department of Defense Indo-Pa-
18
cific Strategy Report released in June 2019 
19
found that— 
20
(i) if the People’s Republic of China 
21
or another strategic competitor in the 
22
Indo-Pacific region decides ‘‘to advance 
23
their interests through force, they are like-
24

the onset of conflict. In a fait accompli sce-
1
nario, competitors would seek to employ 
2
their capabilities quickly to achieve limited 
3
objectives and forestall a response from the 
4
United States, and its allies and partners’’; 
5
and 
6
(ii) an attempted fait accompli by the 
7
People’s Republic of China or another 
8
strategy competitor would constitute one of 
9
the ‘‘most stressing potential scenarios’’ 
10
facing the United States Armed Forces. 
11
(C) The Tri-Service Maritime Strategy re-
12
leased by the United States Navy, United 
13
States Marine Corps, and United States Coast 
14
Guard in December 2020 stated, ‘‘In the event 
15
of conflict, China . . . will likely attempt to 
16
seize territory before the United States and its 
17
allies can mount an effective response—leading 
18
to a fait accompli.’’. 
19
(D) The Army Multi-Domain Trans-
20
formation strategic guidance released by Army 
21
Chief of Staff General James McConville in 
22
March 2021 stated that China and other adver-
23
saries of the United States will seek to ‘‘seize 
24
their objectives quickly as a fait accompli,’’ if

4
Government of the People’s Republic of China 
5
is developing capabilities that could be used 
6
‘‘achieve a ‘fait accompli’ that would make re-
7
versing Chinese gains more difficult, militarily 
8
and politically’’. 
9
(F) Special Assistant to the Secretary of 
10
Defense for China Ely Ratner assessed in Jan-
11
uary 2020 that ‘‘China has made significant in-
12
vestments in long-range ISR and strike assets’’ 
13
and ‘‘China hopes the threat of these attacks 
14
will deter U.S. intervention by negating a sub-
15
stantial portion of U.S. airpower early in a con-
16
flict, thereby creating time and space for a fait 
17

(G) Former Under Secretary of Defense 
19
for Policy Michele Flournoy warned in June 
20
2020 that the Government of the People’s Re-
21
public of China may believe the United States

3
(5) There is broad agreement that the United 
4
States should maintain the ability of the United 
5
States Armed Forces to defeat a fait accompli by the 
6
People’s Republic of China, including as follows: 
7
(A) The National Defense Strategy Com-
8
mission assessed in November 2018 that com-
9
peting successfully in ‘‘the Indo-Pacific region, 
10
while also managing escalation dynamics, re-
11
quires positioning substantial capability forward 
12
. . . to deter and prevent a fait accompli by an 
13
agile, opportunistic adversary’’. 
14
(B) Then-Acting Secretary of Defense Pat-
15
rick Shanahan testified in March 2019 that im-
16
plementation of the 2018 National Defense 
17
Strategy was required to ensure the United 
18
States had ‘‘the capabilities, posture, and em-
19
ployment of forces’’ necessary to prevent a fait

September 2019 that ‘‘Beijing cannot be al-

lowed to use the threat of force to pursue a fait 
2

3
(D) In January 2020, Secretary of De-
4
fense Lloyd Austin upheld the assessment by 
5
the Indo-Pacific Strategy Report that Depart-
6
ment of Defense ‘‘initiatives on force employ-
7
ment, crisis response, force and concept devel-
8
opment, and collaboration with allies and part-
9
ners’’ should be ‘‘aimed to help address this 
10
critical challenge’’ of a potential fait accompli 
11
scenario involving the People’s Republic of 
12
China. 
13
(E) Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen 
14
Hicks testified in February 2020 that the Peo-
15
ple’s Republic of China is ‘‘less likely’’ to at-
16
tempt a fait accompli against Taiwan if it 
17
knows that the United States will be able to de-
18
feat such an attempt, and that the United 
19
States should therefore maintain the ability to 
20
defeat a fait accompli by the People’s Republic 
21
of China against Taiwan. 
22
(F) Admiral Davidson and Admiral Aqui-
23

that the United States should maintain the 
1
ability to defeat a fait accompli by the People’s 
2
Republic of China against Taiwan in order to 
3
strengthen deterrence against such a contin-
4
gency. 
5
(G) Former Under Secretary of Defense 
6
for Policy James Miller wrote in October 2020 
7
that ‘‘U.S. defense planners must maintain a 
8
laser focus on a scenario for which U.S. forces 
9
are ill-prepared today, in which China . . . 
10
see[s] the opportunity for a quick invasion of a 
11
U.S. partner or ally and attempt to impose a 
12
fait accompli that would be costly and risky to 
13
reverse’’. 
14
(6) There is likewise broad agreement that a 
15
strategy of denial is essential to deter or defeat a 
16
fait accompli by the People’s Republic of China 
17
against Taiwan, including as follows: 
18
(A) The 2018 National Defense Strategy 
19
tasked the Department of Defense with pos-
20
turing and employing forces to ‘‘delay, degrade, 
21
or deny adversary aggression’’. 
22
(B) Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin ar-
23
gued in January 2020 that a ‘‘combat-credible, 
24
forward deterrent posture is instrumental to the

United States military’s ability to deter, and if 
1
necessary, deny a fait accompli scenario’’. 
2
(C) Deputy Secretary Hicks, Under Sec-
3
retary Kahl, Admiral Davidson, and Admiral 
4
Aquilino reaffirmed the emphasis by Secretary 
5
Austin on denial and testified that a strategy of 
6
denial is essential for deterring Chinese aggres-
7
sion. 
8
(D) The Joint Operating Concept for De-
9
terrence Operations released in December 2017 
10
states that forward-deployed forces contribute 
11
to ‘‘denying benefits’’ and thereby reduce ‘‘the 
12
likelihood of an adversary achieving strategic or 
13
tactical surprise, thus helping to prevent adver-
14
sary decision makers from concluding they 
15
might achieve a military fait accompli that 
16
could be extremely costly for the US to reverse 
17
by force’’. 
18
(E) The United States Army’s Multi-Do-
19
main Operations concept document released in 
20
December 2018 states that Army forces must 
21
demonstrate the capability ‘‘to immediately 
22
deny a fait accompli’’ in order to deter a near- 
23
peer adversary.

(F) The Marine Corps Force Design 2030 
1
report released in March 2020 states that for-
2
ward-deployed forces possess the capability to 
3
‘‘attrite adversary forces, enable joint force ac-
4
cess requirements, complicate targeting and 
5
consume adversary ISR resources, and prevent 
6
fait accompli scenarios’’. 
7
(G) The Tri-Service Maritime Strategy di-
8
rects the United States Navy, United States 
9
Marine Corps, and United States Coast Guard 
10
to ‘‘deny adversaries their objectives, defeat ad-
11
versary forces while managing escalation, and 
12
set the conditions for favorable conflict termi-
13
nation’’. 
14
(7) Under the Taiwan Relations Act (22 U.S.C. 
15
3301 et seq.), it is the policy of the United States 
16
to consider any effort to determine the future of 
17
Taiwan by other than peaceful means to be of grave 
18
concern to the United States, and— 
19
(A) the Taiwan Relations Act further es-
20
tablishes it as the policy of the United States 
21
‘‘to maintain the capacity of the United States 
22
to resist any resort to force or other forms of 
23
coercion that would jeopardize the security, or

8

of the United States under the Taiwan Rela-

12
Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act 
13
for Fiscal Year 2021 (Public Law 116–283) re-
14
affirms that the Taiwan Relations Act and the 
15
Six Assurances are the cornerstones of United 
16
States relations with Taiwan; 
17
(E) the Department of State reaffirmed in 
18
January 2021 that ‘‘[t]he United States main-
19
tains its longstanding commitments as outlined 
20
in the Three Communiques, the Taiwan Rela-
21

It is the sense of Congress that—

21

(2) the most effective way for the People’s Re-

5
ple’s Republic of China is likely to take the form of 
6

requires the United States to maintain the ability of 
9
the United States Armed Forces to defeat a fait 
10

11
Taiwan, and officials across multiple administrations 
12

13
(A) the United States should maintain the 
14
ability of the United States Armed Forces to

defeat a fait accompli by the People’s Republic
