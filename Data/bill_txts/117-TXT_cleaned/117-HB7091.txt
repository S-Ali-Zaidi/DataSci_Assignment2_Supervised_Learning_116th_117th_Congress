SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Henrietta Lacks Con-
2
gressional Gold Medal Act’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) Henrietta Lacks, an African-American 
6
woman born on August 1, 1920, in Roanoke, Vir-
7
ginia, was raised by her grandfather on a tobacco 
8
farm in Clover, Virginia. 
9
(2) Henrietta Lacks, her husband, and family 
10
moved to Baltimore, Maryland in 1941 seeking eco-
11
nomic opportunity at the Bethlehem Steel Plant. 
12
(3) In 1951, Henrietta Lacks sought treatment 
13
for her continuous vaginal bleeding from The Johns 
14
Hopkins Hospital, which was one of the few hos-
15
pitals willing to treat African Americans at that 
16
time. Gynecologists discovered a large, malignant 
17
tumor on her cervix. 
18
(4) Unbeknownst to Henrietta Lacks or her 
19
family, medical researchers took samples of Hen-
20
rietta Lacks’ tumor during her treatment without 
21
her consent. Henrietta Lacks’ cells, now known as 
22
‘‘HeLa Cells’’, doubled every 20 to 24 hours whereas 
23
other human cells died in the same time period. The 
24
HeLa Cells are the first known immortal line of 
25
human cells in history.

(5) On October 4, 1951, 31-year-old Henrietta 
1
Lacks died of an aggressive cervical cancer eight 
2
months after her cancer diagnosis, leaving behind 
3
her husband and 5 children. 
4
(6) The HeLa immortal cell line is the oldest 
5
and most used human cell line used in scientific re-
6
search. Henrietta Lacks’ immortal cells have been 
7
commercialized and distributed worldwide to re-
8
searchers, resulting in groundbreaking advancements 
9
in modern science and technology. 
10
(7) Henrietta Lacks’ prolific cells continue to 
11
replicate to this day and contribute to remarkable 
12
advances in medicine, including the development of 
13
the polio vaccine and drugs used to treat cancer, 
14
HIV/AIDS, hemophilia, leukemia, and Parkinson’s 
15
disease. HeLa cells have been used in research that 
16
has contributed to our understanding of the effects 
17
of radiation and zero gravity on human cells, and 
18
have informed research on chromosomal conditions, 
19
cancer, gene mapping, and precision medicine. 
20
(8) The use of HeLa cells as the foundation for 
21
biomedical research has led to several Nobel Prize 
22
winning discoveries. The National Institute of 
23
Health located over 110,000 publications that cited 
24
the use of HeLa cells between 1953 to 2018. These 
25

•HR 7091 IH
advances were made possible by Henrietta Lacks’ 
1
cells, yet the revenues they generated were not 
2
known to her family for more than twenty years. 
3
(9) Henrietta Lacks is a linchpin to modern 
4
bioethics policies and informed consent laws that 
5
benefit patients nationwide by building patient trust 
6
and protecting research participants. 
7
(10) Henrietta Lacks’ legacy has been recog-
8
nized around the world through memorials, con-
9
ferences, museum exhibitions, libraries, and print 
10
and visual media for changing the face of medical 
11
science.
