To require the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
to collect and report certain data concerning COVID–19. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress makes the following findings: 
2
(1) The World Health Organization (WHO) de-
3
clared COVID–19 a ‘‘Public Health Emergency of 
4
International Concern’’ on January 30, 2020. By 
5
late January 2021, there have been over 22,000,000 
6
confirmed cases of, and 383,351 deaths associated 
7
with, COVID–19 in the United States. 
8
(2) From the beginning of this pandemic, 
9
Black, Brown, and American Indian/Alaska Native 
10
(in this section referred to as ‘‘AI/AN’’) people in 
11
the United States have suffered the largest burden 
12
of illness, hospitalization, and death from COVID– 
13
19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
14
(CDC) reports that AI/AN people are 4 times as 
15
likely as White people to be hospitalized for COVID– 
16
19, and that Black and Hispanic/Latino people are 
17
2.8 times as likely to die of COVID–19 as White 
18
people. 
19
(3) Historically, structures and systems such as 
20
racism, ableism, and class oppression have rendered 
21
affected Black and Brown communities more vulner-
22
able to inequities and have prevented people from 
23
achieving optimal health even when there is not a 
24
crisis of pandemic proportions, highlighting that rac-
25

•HR 1370 IH
ism and not race presents as a risk factor driving 
1
inequities in illness and death. 
2
(4) Significant differences in access to health 
3
care, specifically to primary health care providers, 
4
health care information, and greater perceived dis-
5
crimination in health care place Black, Brown, and 
6
AI/AN communities, individuals with disabilities, 
7
and Limited English Proficient individuals at great-
8
er risk of receiving delayed, and perhaps poorer, 
9
health care. 
10
(5) Stark racial inequities across the United 
11
States, including unequal access to stable housing, 
12
quality education, and decent employment, signifi-
13
cantly impact the ability of Black, Hispanic/Latinx, 
14
and AI/AN individuals to take care of their most 
15
basic health needs. Black and Brown communities 
16
are more likely to experience homelessness and 
17
struggle with low-paying jobs or unemployment. An 
18
analysis by the University of New Hampshire found 
19
that in every month between March and August 
20
2020, Black and Latino workers had significantly 
21
higher unemployment rates than White workers, 
22
even after adjusting for age and education status. 
23
(6) Black, Hispanic/Latinx, and AI/AN commu-
24
nities experience higher rates of chronic disease and 
25

disabilities, such as diabetes, hypertension, and asth-
1
ma, than non-Hispanic White communities, which 
2
predisposes them to greater risk of complications 
3
and mortality should they contract COVID–19. 
4
(7) Research experts recognize that there are 
5
underlying differences in illness and death when 
6
each of these factors is examined through socio-
7
economic and racial or ethnic lenses. These socially 
8
determinant factors of health accelerate disease and 
9
degradation. 
10
(8) Language barriers are highly correlated 
11
with medication noncompliance and inconsistent en-
12
gagement with health systems. Without language ac-
13
cessibility data and research around COVID–19, 
14
communities with limited English proficiency are 
15
less likely to receive critical testing and preventive 
16
health services. Yet, to date, the Centers for Disease 
17
Control and Prevention does not disseminate 
18
COVID–19 messaging in critical languages, includ-
19
ing Mandarin Chinese, Spanish, and Korean within 
20
the same timeframe as information in English de-
21
spite requirements to ensure limited English pro-
22
ficient populations are not discriminated against 
23
under title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 
24
subsequent laws and Federal policies.

(9) Further, it is critical to disaggregate data 
1
further by ancestry to address disparities among 
2
Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Is-
3
lander groups. According to the National Equity 
4
Atlas, while 13 percent of the Asian population over-
5
all lived in poverty in 2015, 39 percent of Burmese 
6
people, 29 percent of Hmong people, and 21 percent 
7
of Pacific Islanders lived in poverty. 
8
(10) Utilizing disaggregation of enrollment in 
9
Affordable Care Act-sponsored health insurance, the 
10
Asian and Pacific Islander American Health Forum 
11
found that prior to the passage of the Patient Pro-
12
tection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111– 
13
148), Korean Americans had a high uninsured rate 
14
of 23 percent, compared to just 12 percent for all 
15
Asian Americans. Developing targeted outreach ef-
16
forts assisted 1,000,000 people and resulted in a 56 
17
percent decrease in the uninsured among the Asian, 
18
Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander population. 
19
Such efforts show that disaggregated data is essen-
20
tial to public health mobilizations efforts. 
21
(11) Without clear understanding of how 
22
COVID–19 impacts marginalized racial and ethnic 
23
communities, there will be exacerbated risk of en-
24
dangering the most historically vulnerable of our 
25
01:00 Mar 31, 2021

•HR 1370 IH
Nation. A recent national study found that Amer-
1
ican Indian/Alaska Natives were 3.5 times more like-
2
ly to be infected with COVID–19, however that data 
3
excluded 27 States as they had reported less than 70 
4
percent of race/ethnicity data to the Centers for Dis-
5
ease Control and Prevention making it impossible to 
6
include them in the analysis thus creating a signifi-
7
cant data gap for understanding the impact of 
8
COVID–19 on this vulnerable population. 
9
(12) The consequences of misunderstanding the 
10
racial and ethnic impact of COVID–19 expound be-
11
yond communities of color such that it would impact 
12
all. 
13
(13) Race and ethnicity are valuable research 
14
and practice variables when used and interpreted ap-
15
propriately. Health data collected on patients by 
16
race and ethnicity will boost and more efficiently di-
17
rect critical resources and inform risk communica-
18
tion development in languages and at appropriate 
19
health literacy levels, which resonate with historically 
20
vulnerable communities of color. 
21
(14) To date, race and ethnicity data on 
22
COVID–19 cases, test, hospitalizations, deaths, and 
23
vaccinations is incomplete and lacking. The incon-
24
sistency of data collection by Federal, State, and 
25
01:00 Mar 31, 2021
H1370

•HR 1370 IH
local health authorities poses a threat to analysis 
1
and synthesis of the pandemic impact on Black, His-
2
panic/Latinx, and AI/AN communities. However, re-
3
search and medical experts of Historically Black 
4
Colleges and Universities and Tribal Colleges and 
5
Universities, academic health care institutions which 
6
are historically and geographically embedded in 
7
minoritized and marginalized communities, generally 
8
also possess rapport with the communities they 
9
serve. They are well-positioned, as trusted thought 
10
leaders and health care service providers, to collect 
11
data and conduct research toward creating holistic 
12
solutions to remedy the inequitable impact of this 
13
and future public health crises. 
14
(15) Well-designed, ethically sound research 
15
aligns with the goals of medicine, addresses ques-
16
tions relevant to the population among whom the 
17
study will be carried out, balances the potential for 
18
benefit against the potential for harm, employs 
19
study designs that will yield scientifically valid and 
20
significant data, and generates useful knowledge. 
21
(16) The dearth of racially and ethnically 
22
disaggregated data reflecting the health of Black, 
23
Hispanic/Latinx, and AI/AN communities underlies

(17) Without collecting race and ethnicity data

associated with COVID–19 vaccinations, testing, 
4
hospitalizations, morbidities, and mortalities, as well

as publicly disclosing it, Black, Hispanic/Latinx, and
