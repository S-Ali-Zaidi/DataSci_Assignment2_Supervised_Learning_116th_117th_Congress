A BILL 
To ensure that Federal work-study funding is available for 
students enrolled in residency programs for teachers, 
principals, or school leaders, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Teacher, Principal, 
4
and Leader Residency Access Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Across the United States, local educational 
8
agencies and elementary and secondary schools are 
9

•HR 3244 IH
struggling to meet the growing demand for qualified 
1
teachers. In 2017–18, more than 100,000 class-
2
rooms in the United States were staffed by instruc-
3
tors who were unqualified to teach. These class-
4
rooms are disproportionately located in low-income, 
5
high-minority schools, although schools of every kind 
6
have been affected by a lack of qualified applicants 
7
in key subjects including mathematics, special edu-
8
cation, science, world languages, career and tech-
9
nical education, and teachers of English learners. 
10
(2) Teacher shortages are in significant part 
11
driven by teacher turnover. Research shows that 
12
teacher turnover is higher for those who enter the 
13
profession without adequate preparation. Teachers 
14
who enter the profession through a comprehensive 
15
high-quality program with student teaching, formal 
16
feedback on their teaching, and multiple courses in 
17
student learning, as required in high-quality teach-
18
ing residency programs, are more likely to remain in 
19
the profession compared to teachers who enter 
20
through a route that lacks these components. Not 
21
only are under-prepared teachers less effective on 
22
average, they are also 2 to 3 times more likely to 
23
leave teaching than fully prepared teachers.

•HR 3244 IH
(3) Teacher shortages and teacher turnover are 
1
costly. Each time a teacher leaves a school, it not 
2
only increases demand but also imposes replacement 
3
costs on the local educational agency, which range 
4
from $9,000 per teacher in small rural local edu-
5
cational agencies to over $20,000 in large urban 
6
local educational agencies. The national price tag of 
7
replacement 
costs 
for 
teachers 
is 
over 
8
$8,000,000,000 a year. 
9
(4) Teaching residency programs, which recruit 
10
candidates to work as paid apprentices to skilled ex-
11
pert teachers while completing highly integrated 
12
coursework, have been successful in recruiting tal-
13
ented, diverse candidates into high-need fields and 
14
local educational agencies. 
15
(5) Research on teaching residency programs 
16
show that such programs are effective in bringing 
17
more teachers of color into the profession and in 
18
preparing such teachers to stay for the long term. In 
19
the United States, about 49 percent of individuals in 
20
teaching residency programs are students of color, 
21
and the same percentage of public school students 
22
are people of color, but only 20 percent of teachers 
23
are people of color.

(6) The teaching residency program model cre-
1
ates long-term benefits for local educational agen-
2
cies, schools, and for the students served by such 
3
agencies and schools. Rigorous studies of teaching 
4
residency programs have found significantly higher 
5
retention rates for graduates of teaching residency 
6
programs, addressing one of the primary contribu-
7
tors to teacher shortages, as well as positive evidence 
8
about educator effectiveness. 
9
(7) A review of teaching residency program 
10
evaluations shows that teachers who completed high 
11
quality teaching residency programs tend to have 
12
higher teaching retention rates over time compared 
13
to teachers who did not complete such programs, in-
14
cluding— 
15
(A) in San Francisco, where 80 percent of 
16
candidates completing a teaching residency pro-
17
gram were still in the classroom after 5 years, 
18
compared to 38 percent of candidates who en-
19
tered the classroom through a different route; 
20
(B) in Boston, where teaching residents 
21
participating in the Boston Teacher Residency 
22
program had higher retention rates compared 
23
to teachers who were not teaching residents, 
24
with 80 percent of residents still teaching in

Boston Public schools for a third year, com-
1
pared to 63 percent of teachers who were not 
2
teaching residents, and 75 percent of teaching 
3
residents still teaching for a fifth year, com-
4
pared to 51 percent of teachers who were not 
5
teaching residents; 
6
(C) in Tennessee, where 95 percent of 
7
Memphis Teacher Residency program partici-
8
pants were still teaching for a third year, com-
9
pared with 41 percent of teachers statewide; 
10
and 
11
(D) additional studies of teaching resi-
12
dency programs show similarly high retention 
13
rates of graduates, ranging from 80 percent to 
14
90 percent teaching in the same district after 3 
15
years, and 70 percent to 80 percent teaching in 
16
the same district after 5 years. 
17
(8) According to data from the San Francisco 
18
Unified School District, principals find graduates of 
19
teaching residency programs to be well prepared, 
20
and in many cases to be better prepared than new 
21
teachers who were not in teaching residency pro-
22
grams. Research also shows that teaching residents 
23
strengthen schools across the country by reducing 
24
teacher shortages and providing local educational

agencies with a more sustainable educator work-
1
force. 
2
(9) In 2019, there were at least 50 teaching 
3
residency programs nationwide, which range in size 
4
from five to 100 teaching residents per year. Several 
5
States, including California, Colorado, Georgia, Illi-
6
nois, Indiana, Louisiana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, 
7
Tennessee, Texas, and West Virginia, are supporting 
8
teaching residency programs through regional net-
9
work partnerships that regularly bring together lead-
10
ership from across local educational agencies and 
11
preparation programs to share knowledge and de-
12
velop more enduring and reciprocal relationships be-
13
tween such agencies. 
14
(10) Teaching residency programs align with 
15
the purpose of the Federal Work-Study Program to 
16
provide valuable work experience and work related to 
17
a student’s course of study and intended profession. 
18
Further, 
the 
Federal 
Work-Study 
Program 
19
prioritizes teaching reading based on scientifically- 
20
based research on reading, a feature consistent with 
21
efforts in teaching residency programs to equip all 
22
new teachers, regardless of subject area, with the 
23
skills to support reading and literacy skills for all 
24
students.

(11) According to a recent report by the George 
1
W. Bush Institute on principal talent management, 
2
preparing successful principals requires new, com-
3
prehensive approaches by school districts, univer-
4
sities, States, and others who pull together to train 
5
and support principals. Thoughtfully designed and 
6
implemented principal residency programs can be a 
7
powerful piece of this comprehensive and collabo-
8
rative approach to training future educational lead-
9
ership. 
10
(12) Residencies for aspiring school principals 
11
are a promising approach to initiate principal can-
12
didates into school leadership practice and has be-
13
come a part of some comprehensive principal prepa-
14
ration programs over the past 20 years. Principal 
15
residencies reinvent the traditional internship experi-
16
ence, which has often been the capstone experience 
17
in principal preparation. Residency immerses prin-
18
cipal candidates in rigorous apprenticeship experi-
19
ences that are designed to advance leadership and 
20
management practices, as well as emphasize data 
21
analysis, action, reflection, and accountability.
