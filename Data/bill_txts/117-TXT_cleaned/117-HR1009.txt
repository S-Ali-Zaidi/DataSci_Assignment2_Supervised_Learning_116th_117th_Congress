RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives regard-
ing the consideration of ‘‘Just War’’ principles prior 
to any vote with respect to a declaration of war or

involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the cir-

(A) stopping a genocide or ethnic cleans-

6
(B) stopping grievous, massive, and irrep-
7
arable harm to the environment; or 
8
(C) protecting the United States or its al-
9
lies from invasion or mass destruction; 
10
(2) whether the proposed action will be— 
11
(A) in response only to the underlying just 
12
cause; 
13
(B) proportional to the underlying just 
14
cause; and 
15
(C) undertaken with the intent to reestab-
16
lish peace; 
17
(3) whether the presumed benefits of the pro-
18
posed action outweigh the harm done; 
19
(4) whether there is a reasonable probability 
20
that the proposed action will succeed; and 
21
(5) whether all alternatives to military action 
22
have been exhausted.
