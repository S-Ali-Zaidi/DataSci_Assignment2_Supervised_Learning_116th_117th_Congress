A BILL 
To permit employees to request changes to their work sched-
ules without fear of retaliation and to ensure that em-
ployers consider these requests, and to require employers 
to provide more predictable and stable schedules for em-
ployees in certain occupations with evidence of unpredict-
able and unstable scheduling practices that negatively 
affect employees, and for other purposes.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS. 
3
(a) SHORT TITLE.—This Act may be cited as the 
4
‘‘Schedules That Work Act’’. 
5
(b) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) The vast majority of the United States 
7
workforce today is juggling responsibilities at home 
8
and at work. Women are primary breadwinners or 
9
co-breadwinners in 2⁄3 of families with children in 
10
the United States. 
11
(2) Despite the dual responsibilities of today’s 
12
workforce, many workers have little notice of their 
13
work schedules and lack the ability to make changes 
14
to the work hours in such schedules, which under-
15
mines their ability to accommodate family respon-
16
sibilities. 
17
(3)(A) Mothers working in low-paid jobs are 
18
more likely to be the primary or sole breadwinner for 
19
their families than mothers working in higher-paid 
20
jobs. For example, nearly 7 in 10 mothers in the 1⁄5 
21
of households in the United States with the lowest 
22
incomes bring home all or most of their families’ in-
23
come, compared to less than 1⁄3 of their counterparts 
24
in the highest-income quintile.

•HR 6670 IH
(B) At the same time, low-paid workers often 
1
have the least control over their work hours and face 
2
the most unpredictable schedules. In some indus-
3
tries, ‘‘just-in-time’’ scheduling practices, which base 
4
workers’ schedules on perceived consumer demand to 
5
minimize labor costs, are particularly common. Em-
6
ployers using these practices often post work sched-
7
ules with little notice, vary work hours widely from 
8
week to week, cancel shifts at the last minute, and 
9
schedule employees for ‘‘on call’’ shifts (requiring an 
10
employee to call in to work to find out whether the 
11
employee will have to work later that day) or 
12
‘‘clopening’’ shifts (requiring an employee to work a 
13
closing shift at night followed by an opening shift a 
14
few hours later). For example, national survey data 
15
show that— 
16
(i) about 2⁄3 of hourly retail and food serv-
17
ice workers receive their work schedules with 
18
less than 2 weeks’ advance notice and about 1⁄3 
19
receive their schedule with less than 1 week’s 
20
notice; 
21
(ii) more than 1 in 5 hourly retail and food 
22
service workers have been scheduled for on-call 
23
shifts, and more than 1 in 3 have worked 
24
‘‘clopening’’ shifts; and 
25
02:21 Feb 17, 2022
H6670
4 
•HR 6670 IH
(iii) 65 percent of hourly retail and food 
1
service workers would like a more stable and 
2
predictable schedule. 
3
(4) Unfair work scheduling practices make it 
4
difficult for low-paid workers to— 
5
(A) provide necessary care for children and 
6
other family members, including securing and 
7
maintaining stable child care; 
8
(B) access and receive needed care for the 
9
workers’ own serious health conditions; 
10
(C) pursue workforce training; 
11
(D) get or keep a second job, which many 
12
workers need to make ends meet; 
13
(E) plan for and access transportation to 
14
reach worksites; and 
15
(F) qualify for and maintain eligibility for 
16
needed public benefits and work supports, such 
17
as child care subsidies and benefits under the 
18
supplemental nutrition assistance program, due 
19
to fluctuations in income and work hours. 
20
(5) Unstable work schedules pre-date the pan-
21
demic and economic recession caused by COVID–19, 
22
but the harm of these workplace practices is exacer-
23
bated as millions of workers risk their own health 
24
and safety at jobs with few protections, volatile 
25

schedules, and inadequate hours, in an effort to sup-
1
port themselves and their families. Employers have 
2
continued to use ‘‘just-in-time’’ scheduling practices 
3
throughout the pandemic, even as workers face addi-
4
tional caregiving challenges due to school and child 
5
care closures and quarantines. 
6
(6) A growing body of research demonstrates 
7
that unstable and unpredictable work schedules have 
8
significant detrimental impacts on sleep quality, 
9
mental health, and happiness, and are associated 
10
with unstable child care arrangements and negative 
11
health and behavioral outcomes for children. And 
12
impacts are likely to be the most severe for workers 
13
of color and their families, as workers of color are 
14
more likely than their White counterparts—even 
15
compared to White coworkers at the same com-
16
pany—to experience unstable work schedules. Unsta-
17
ble and unpredictable work schedules—and the 
18
work-family conflict they produce—are also associ-
19
ated with higher rates of turnover, which creates 
20
further instability for employers and workers. Some 
21
examples of the detrimental impacts of unstable and 
22
unpredictable work schedules are as follows: 
23
(A) Unstable work schedules lead to more 
24
household economic strain and time conflicts 
25

and undermine the well-being of parents, all of 
1
which can negatively impact children’s health 
2
and behavior. 
3
(B) Workers with the most severe insta-
4
bility in their work schedules also face the high-
5
est risk of negative behavior and health out-
6
comes for their children. 
7
(C) The exposure of a parent to on-call 
8
shifts and last-minute shift changes are associ-
9
ated with more unstable child care arrange-
10
ments and with the use of siblings to provide 
11
care. 
12
(D) Work schedule instability causes more 
13
work-family conflict, which increases the chance 
14
that a worker will be forced to leave his or her 
15
job, which is associated with downward mobility 
16
of the earnings of the worker. 
17
(E)(i) Relative to White workers, workers 
18
of color are more likely to— 
19
(I) have cancelled shifts; 
20
(II) have on-call shifts; 
21
(III) be involuntary part-time work-
22
ers; 
23
(IV) have trouble getting time off; 
24
and

•HR 6670 IH
(V) work ‘‘clopening’’ shifts, as de-
1
scribed in paragraph (3)(B). 
2
(ii) The statistics described in clause (i) re-
3
main true after controlling for demographics, 
4
human capital, worker power, firm segregation, 
5
and discordance with the race or ethnicity of 
6
the worker and the manager. Race gaps in job 
7
quality are greater for women of color. 
8
(F) Workers who receive shorter advanced 
9
notice, who work on-call shifts, who experience 
10
last-minute 
shift 
cancellation 
and 
timing 
11
changes, or with more volatile work hours are 
12
more likely to experience hunger, residential 
13
hardships, and more overall economic hardship. 
14
(7) Unpredictable and unstable work schedules 
15
are common in a wide range of occupations, with 
16
evidence of particular concentration in food service, 
17
retail, cleaning, hospitality, and warehouse occupa-
18
tions. These occupations are critically important to 
19
the United States economy. 
20
(8) Employers that have implemented fair work 
21
scheduling policies that allow workers to have more 
22
control over their work schedules, and provide more 
23
predictable and stable schedules, have experienced 
24
significant benefits, including reductions in absentee-
25
02:21 Feb 17, 2022

•HR 6670 IH
ism and workforce turnover, and increased worker 
1
morale and engagement. For example, when Gap 
2
Inc. piloted strategies to make work schedules more 
3
stable and predictable for employees, the Gap Inc. 
4
stores that implemented these strategies experienced 
5
higher productivity and a 7 percent increase in sales, 
6
compared to those Gap Inc. stores that did not im-
7
plement these strategies. 
8
(9) This Act is a first step in responding to the 
9
needs of workers for a voice in the timing of their 
10
work hours and for more predictable schedules.
