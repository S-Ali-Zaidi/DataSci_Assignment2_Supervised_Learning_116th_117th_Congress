SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
1
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that— 
2
(1) natural disasters often cause loss of life, 
3
human suffering, loss of income, and property loss 
4
and damage; 
5
(2) natural disasters often disrupt the normal 
6
functioning of governments and communities and 
7
adversely affect individuals and families with great 
8
severity; and 
9
(3) special measures, designed to assist with 
10
and supplement natural disaster response efforts, 
11
such as replacing the wide utilization of diesel gen-
12
erators with microreactors when responding to the 
13
impacts of a natural disaster, are necessary and 
14
worthwhile for the wellbeing of the United States. 
15
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
16
gress that Congress should support the utilization of nu-
17
clear energy, with a priority for nuclear energy generated 
18
by microreactors, during natural disaster response efforts 
19
because of the following considerations: 
20
(1) Nuclear energy generated by a microreactor 
21
provides a safe form of consistent and reliable elec-
22
tricity that is generally sought when responding to 
23
the impacts of natural disasters. 
24
(2) Nuclear energy that is generated by micro-
25
reactors— 
26
03:27 Aug 11, 2022
H8611

•HR 8611 IH
(A) is the cleanest, rapidly deployable 
1
source of energy available that can provide un-
2
interrupted power to assist with natural dis-
3
aster response efforts; and 
4
(B) can be used to augment diesel-gen-
5
erated power during national disaster response 
6
efforts. 
7
(3) The generation of electricity from micro-
8
reactors emits fewer greenhouse gas emissions than 
9
the generation of electricity from other sources of 
10
electricity. 
11
(4) Microreactors can be easily transported and 
12
carried by aircraft, semi-trucks, or shipping vessels 
13
to timely provide electricity upon demand to an area 
14
that is impacted by a natural disaster. 
15
(5) Microreactors can be operated autono-
16
mously, which avoids the need for on-site operators 
17
in an area that is impacted by a natural disaster. 
18
(6) Microreactors can be operated for several 
19
years without being refueled, which avoids logistical 
20
challenges associated with refueling other power 
21
sources, including diesel generators, in an area that 
22
is impacted by a natural disaster. 
23
(7) With approval by the Nuclear Regulatory 
24
Commission, microreactors can be— 
25
03:27 Aug 11, 2022
H8611

•HR 8611 IH
(A) mass produced in factories around the 
1
United States; and 
2
(B) mass deployed to assist with natural 
3
disaster response efforts. 
4
(8) Nuclear energy generated by a microreactor 
5
can be used to help restore electrical grids by pro-
6
viding temporary power and spot generation for crit-
7
ical electricity generating facilities while grid repairs 
8
take place. 
9
(9) Microreactors can— 
10
(A) power lifesaving and life-sustaining fa-
11
cilities, such as hospitals; 
12
(B) power mass transit systems and water 
13
quality treatment plants; 
14
(C) power large pumps that are often used 
15
to remove water from an impacted area; and 
16
(D) support the operation of local, State, 
17
and Federal facilities in the event that a nat-
18
ural disaster severely impacts such facilities and 
19
results in the loss of electricity for such facili-
20
ties. 
21
(10) After providing electricity to an area that 
22
is impacted by a natural disaster, microreactors can 
23
be easily transported out of the area to other loca-
24
tions where they are needed or to standby storage
