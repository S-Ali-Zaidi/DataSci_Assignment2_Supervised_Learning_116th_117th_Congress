RESOLUTION 
Condemning rising antisemitism. 
Whereas the Jewish-American experience is a story of faith, 
fortitude, and progress and is connected to key tenets of 
American identity; 
Whereas generations of Jewish people have come to this Na-
tion fleeing oppression, discrimination, and persecution in 
search of a better life for themselves and their children; 
Whereas these Jewish Americans have created lives for them-
selves and their families and played indispensable roles in 
our Nation’s civic and community life, making invaluable 
contributions to our Nation through their leadership and 
achievements;

Whereas, on August 21, 1790, President George Washington 
sent a letter to the Hebrew Congregation of Newport, 
Rhode Island, expressing that the newly formed United 
States would be a Nation that ‘‘gives to bigotry no sanc-
tion, to persecution no assistance’’ and that the Jewish 
people should ‘‘dwell in this land [and] continue to merit 
and enjoy the good will of the other inhabitants . . . and 
there shall be none to make him afraid.’’; 
Whereas we should acknowledge and celebrate the crucial 
contributions that Jewish Americans have made to our 
collective struggle for a more just and fair society, lead-
ing movements for justice and equality, and working to 
ensure opportunities for all; 
Whereas alongside this narrative of achievement and oppor-
tunity, there is also a history, far older than the Nation 
itself, of racism, bigotry, and other forms of prejudice 
manifesting in the scourge of antisemitism; 
Whereas antisemitism is an insidious form of prejudice 
stretching back millennia that attacks the humanity of 
the Jewish people and has led to violence, destruction of 
lives and communities, and genocide; 
Whereas conspiracy theories that Jews are uniquely evil and 
influential has led to mass killings of Jews throughout 
time, including the poisonous Nazi ideology that resulted 
in the murder of 6,000,000 Jews, including 1,500,000 
Jewish children, and millions of other victims of the 
Nazis in Europe; 
Whereas over the course of the past decade, Holocaust distor-
tion and denial has grown in intensity; 
Whereas a 2020 survey of all 50 States in the United States 
on Holocaust knowledge among Millennials and Gen Z

conducted by the Conference on Jewish Material Claims 
Against Germany (Claims Conference), found a clear lack 
of awareness of key historical facts; 63 percent of re-
spondents did not know that 6,000,000 Jews were mur-
dered during the Holocaust and 36 percent thought that 
‘‘two million or fewer Jews’’ were killed; 
Whereas there is a documented and dangerous rise of anti-
semitism globally and in the United States, where Jews 
are increasingly affected by the grotesque spread of mis-
information and lies including blame for the spread of 
COVID–19, false claims including the control of the 
media and the financial system, accusations of dual loy-
alty, and a multitude of negative stereotypes; 
Whereas the American Jewish Committee (AJC)’s 2021 State 
of Antisemitism in America report, a survey of American 
Jews and the general public’s perceptions of anti-
semitism, revealed 24 percent of American Jews have 
been personally targeted by antisemitism in the past 12 
months, 4 in 10 American Jews changed their behavior 
at least once out of fear of antisemitism, 90 percent be-
lieve antisemitism is a problem in the United States, and 
82 percent feel it has increased in the past 5 years; 
Whereas, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, 
Jews were the target of 55 percent of all religiously moti-
vated hate crimes in 2020, despite accounting for no 
more than 2 percent of the United States population; 
Whereas the Anti-Defamation League (ADL)’s 2021 Audit of 
Antisemitic Incidents in the United States recorded 
2,717 acts of assault, vandalism, and harassment this 
past year alone, an average of more than 7 incidents per 
day; a 34-percent increase from 2020 and the highest

year on record since ADL began tracking antisemitic in-
cidents in 1979; 
Whereas 525 antisemitic incidents took place at Jewish insti-
tutions, an increase of 61 percent from data collected in 
2020; 
Whereas antisemitic assaults increased by 167 percent in 
2021 compared to the previous year and assaults in 2021 
were 138 percent higher than the rolling 5-year average 
of antisemitic assaults; 
Whereas there was a substantial surge of antisemitic inci-
dents in the United States in May 2021, 387 incidents 
were reported, a 141 percent increase in reports of 
antisemitic incidents compared to May 2020; Jewish indi-
viduals were violently attacked in major cities including 
New York and Los Angeles; 
Whereas the use of antisemitic language, conspiracy theories, 
and hatred has increased on multiple social media plat-
forms—from Facebook and Instagram to Twitter and 
TikTok—including tropes about Jewish control and mes-
sages praising Hitler and demonizing all Jews; 
Whereas a recent example of the violent antisemitism took 
place on Saturday, January 15, 2022, when, during reli-
gious services at Congregation Beth Israel, a terrorist 
held 4 people, including a rabbi, hostage at gunpoint for 
11 hours; 
Whereas police departments in a number of American cities, 
including New York and Los Angeles, have said that they 
are stepping up patrols at synagogues and other locations 
associated with the Jewish community following the hos-
tage situation; 
03:42 May 18, 2022

Whereas there are regular acts of antisemitic vandalism 
against synagogues and Jewish schools in the United 
States and numerous nonlethal attacks on American 
Jews, leaving many Jews feeling increasingly unsafe in 
public spaces and houses of worship; 
Whereas AJC’s 2021 State of Antisemitism in America re-
port revealed 56 percent of respondents’ religious institu-
tions increased security since the Tree of Life synagogue 
shooting; and 
Whereas the rise in antisemitism is part of the larger trend 
of the rise of hate-filled movements that are targeting 
marginalized communities here in the United States: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
