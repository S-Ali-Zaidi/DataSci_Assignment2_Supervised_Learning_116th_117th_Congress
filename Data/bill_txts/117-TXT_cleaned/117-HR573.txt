RESOLUTION 
Recognizing August 3, National Night Out, the national com-
ing together of Americans all over the Nation to unite 
and promote public safety. 
Whereas on the first Tuesday of August, our Nation will ob-
serve National Night Out, a day to cultivate a better re-
lationship between residents of a community and their 
local law enforcement, and to promote public safety; 
Whereas the participation in National Night Out by over 
38,000,000 neighbors in over 16,000 communities across 
the United States for over 38 years is inspiring; 
Whereas the relationship between local law enforcement and 
the residents which they are sworn to protect is impor-
tant in creating a true sense of community;

Kamala Harris, have recognized the impact that National 
Night Out has made across the Nation, bringing all 
Americans closer together to achieve a common goal of

tories and military bases to ensure all are included in the
