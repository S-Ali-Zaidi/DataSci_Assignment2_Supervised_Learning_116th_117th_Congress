Whereas the Proud Boys frequently and haughtily employ 
violent tactics to target marginalized communities; 
Whereas during the Presidential debate on September 30, 
2020, when asked by moderator Chris Wallace to con-
demn ‘‘white supremacists and militia groups’’, former 
President Donald Trump responded by saying that the 
Proud Boys organization should ‘‘stand back and stand 
by’’; 
Whereas during the insurrection at the United States Capitol 
on January 6, 2021, members of the Proud Boys organi-
zation openly led a preplanned, treasonous attempt to 
overturn the results of a legitimate, democratic Presi-
dential election; 
Whereas photographic and video evidence indicate that mem-
bers of the Proud Boys, including some wearing tactical 
gear and earpieces, violently desecrated the Capitol and 
threatened the lives of Members of Congress, congres-
sional employees, law enforcement, and innocent bystand-
ers; 
Whereas several members of the Proud Boys organization 
have been charged by Federal officials for their roles in 
the insurrection at the United States Capitol; 
Whereas, as described in a Federal complaint recently filed 
against Proud Boys leader Dominic ‘‘Spaz’’ Pezzola, in 
the days following the attack he and ‘‘other members of 
the group’’ talked about how they would have ‘‘killed 
then-Vice President Pence and Speaker Nancy Pelosi if 
they had the chance’’; 
Whereas for their roles in other violent acts, members of the 
Proud Boys have been tried and convicted in the United 
States court system for ‘‘gang assaults’’; and
