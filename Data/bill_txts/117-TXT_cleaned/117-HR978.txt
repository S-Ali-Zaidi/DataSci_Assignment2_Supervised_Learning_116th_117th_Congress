Whereas, since its beginnings, Girl Scouts has emphasized 
public service and civic engagement, and has fostered a 
sense of community in girls; 
Whereas Girl Scouts works to champion the ambitions, cul-
tivate the talents, and develop the skills of girls to con-
fidently pursue their passions and make the world a bet-
ter place; 
Whereas, during a time when girls are experiencing increased 
levels of anxiety, stress, loneliness, and depression, Girl 
Scouts provides community, consistency, and connection 
for girls, and is a safe haven in all the uncertainty; 
Whereas girls say that Girl Scouts supports their mental 
health and is an accepting, safe space where they feel 
free to be themselves, and where leaders and other girls 
are sources of support during difficult times; 
Whereas, especially in the time of COVID–19, Girl Scouts 
plays an indispensable role in engaging girls in after-
school and out-of-school programming and experiences 
that expand their world and allow them to tap into their 
inner innovator, changemaker, and leader; 
Whereas, at a time when civics education is missing from 
many schools, Girl Scouts engages girls of all grade levels 
in civics programming that deepens their understanding 
of democracy and government, prepares them for a life-
time of civic engagement, and motivates them to take ac-
tion on issues that are important to them; 
Whereas Girl Scouts offers girls 21st century programming 
in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM), 
the outdoors, entrepreneurship, and beyond, helping girls 
develop invaluable life skills;
