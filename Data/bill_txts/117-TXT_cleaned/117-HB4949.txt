To award a Congressional Gold Medal to the female tele-
phone operators of the Army Signal Corps, known as 
the ‘‘Hello Girls’’. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

•HR 4949 IH
(1) On April 6, 1917, the United States de-
1
clared war against Germany. As a historically neu-
2
tral nation, the United States was unprepared to 
3
fight a technologically modern conflict overseas. The 
4
United States called upon American Telephone and 
5
Telegraph (referred to in this section as ‘‘AT&T’’) 
6
to provide equipment and trained personnel for the 
7
Army Signal Corps in France. AT&T executives in 
8
Army uniform served at home under the provisions 
9
of the Act entitled ‘‘An Act for making further and 
10
more effectual provision for the national defense, 
11
and for other purposes.’’, approved June 3, 1916 
12
(referred to in this section as the ‘‘National Defense 
13
Act of 1916’’), which allowed for the induction of in-
14
dividuals with specialized skills into a reserve force. 
15
(2) When General John Pershing sailed for Eu-
16
rope in May of 1917 as head of the American Expe-
17
ditionary Forces (referred to in this section as the 
18
‘‘AEF’’), he took telephone operating equipment 
19
with him in recognition of the inadequacy of Euro-
20
pean circuitry and with the understanding that tele-
21
phones would play a key role in battlefield commu-
22
nications for the first time in the history of war. 
23
(3) From May to November of 1917, the AEF 
24
struggled to develop the telephone service necessary 
25

•HR 4949 IH
for the Army to function under battlefield condi-
1
tions. Monolingual infantrymen from the United 
2
States were unable to connect calls rapidly or com-
3
municate effectively with their French counterparts 
4
to put calls through over toll lines that linked one 
5
region of the country with another. The Army found 
6
that the average male operator required 60 seconds 
7
to make a connection. That rate was unacceptably 
8
slow, especially for operational calls between com-
9
mand outposts and the front lines. 
10
(4) During this time, in the United States, tele-
11
phone operating was largely sex-segregated. Hired 
12
for their speed in connecting calls, women filled 85 
13
percent of the telephone operating positions in the 
14
United States. It took the average female operator 
15
10 seconds to make a connection. 
16
(5) On November 8, 1917, General Pershing 
17
cabled the War Department and wrote, ‘‘On account 
18
of the great difficulty of obtaining properly qualified 
19
men, request organization and dispatch to France a 
20
force of women telephone operators all speaking 
21
French and English equally well.’’. To begin, Gen-
22
eral Pershing requested 100 women under the com-
23
mand of a commissioned captain, writing that ‘‘All 
24
18:50 Aug 12, 2021
H4949
4 
•HR 4949 IH
should have allowances of Army nurses and should 
1
be uniformed.’’. 
2
(6) The War Department sent press releases to 
3
newspapers across the United States to recruit 
4
women willing to serve for the duration of the war 
5
and face the hazards of submarine warfare and aer-
6
ial bombardment. These articles emphasized that pa-
7
triotic women would be ‘‘full-fledged soldier[s] under 
8
the articles of war’’ and would ‘‘do as much to help 
9
win the war as the men in khaki who go ‘over the 
10
top.’ ’’. All women selected would take the Army 
11
oath. 
12
(7) More than 7,600 women volunteered for the 
13
100 positions described in paragraph (5) and the 
14
first recruits took the Army oath on January 15, 
15
1918. 
16
(8) Like nurses and doctors at the time, female 
17
Signal Corps members had relative rather than tra-
18
ditional ranks and were ranked as Operator, Super-
19
visor, or Chief Operator. When promoted, the 
20
women were required to swear the Army oath again. 
21
(9) Telephone operators were the first women 
22
to serve as soldiers in non-medical classifications 
23
and the job of the operators was to help win the 
24

•HR 4949 IH
war, not to mitigate the harms of the war. In pop-
1
ular parlance, they were known as the ‘‘Hello Girls’’. 
2
(10) Signal Corps Operators wore Army uni-
3
forms and Army insignia always, as well as stand-
4
ard-issue identity disks in case of death, and were 
5
subject to court martial for infractions of the mili-
6
tary code. 
7
(11) Unbeknownst to the women operators and 
8
their immediate officers, the legal counsel of the 
9
Army ruled internally on March 20, 1918, that the 
10
women were not actually soldiers but contract em-
11
ployees, even though the women had not seen or 
12
signed any contracts. Military code allowed only for 
13
the induction of men and the code remained un-
14
changed despite the orders of General Pershing. 
15
Nevertheless, legal counsel also recognized that the 
16
National Defense Act of 1916, which allowed for the 
17
induction of members of the telephone industry of 
18
the United States into the Armed Forces, imposed 
19
no gender restrictions. 
20
(12) Four days later, on March 24, 1918, the 
21
first contingent of operators began their official du-
22
ties in France. The operators arrived before most in-
23
fantrymen of the Armed Forces in order to facilitate 
24
18:50 Aug 12, 2021

•HR 4949 IH
logistics and deployment and spent their first night 
1
in Paris under German bombardment. 
2
(13) After the arrival of the operators, tele-
3
phone service in France improved immediately, as 
4
calls tripled from 13,000 to 36,000 per day. 
5
(14) The Army quickly recruited, trained, and 
6
deployed 5 additional contingents of female Signal 
7
Corps operators. With these personnel, calls in-
8
creased to 150,000 per day. 
9
(15) In addition to standard telephone oper-
10
ating, bilingual Signal Corps members provided si-
11
multaneous translation between officers from France 
12
and officers from the United States, who were com-
13
municating by telephone. 
14
(16) The AEF fought their first major battles 
15
in the last 2 months of the war. By that point, the 
16
Signal Corps considered the contributions of women 
17
to be so essential that, in telephone exchanges clos-
18
est to the front line, the Army exclusively used 
19
women, in rotating 12-hour shifts. In the rear, the 
20
Army established rotating 8-hour shifts and gave 
21
male soldiers the overnight shift when telephone 
22
traffic was slower. 
23
(17) Seven bilingual operators— 
24

•HR 4949 IH
(A) served at the Battles of St. Mihiel and 
1
Meuse-Argonne under the immediate command 
2
of General Pershing; 
3
(B) staffed the Operations Boards through 
4
which orders to advance, fire, and retreat were 
5
delivered to soldiers in the trenches, to artillery 
6
units on alert, and to pilots awaiting orders at 
7
French airfields; and 
8
(C) were awarded a ‘‘Defensive Sector 
9
Clasp’’ for the Meuse-Argonne operation. 
10
(18) The Chief Operator supervising the Hello 
11
Girls, Grace Banker of Passaic, New Jersey, was 
12
awarded the Distinguished Service Medal. Out of 
13
16,000 eligible Signal Corps officers, Banker was 
14
one of only 18 individuals so honored. 
15
(19) Thirty additional operators received special 
16
commendations, many signed by General Pershing 
17
himself, for ‘‘exceptionally meritorious and con-
18
spicuous services’’ in ‘‘Advance Sections’’ of the con-
19
flict. 
20
(20) The war ended on November 11, 1918. As 
21
of that date, 223 female operators served in France 
22
and had connected 26,000,000 calls for the AEF. 
23
(21) The Chief Signal Officer of the Army Sig-
24
nal Corps wrote in his official report 2 days after 
25
18:50 Aug 12, 2021
H4949

•HR 4949 IH
the date on which the war ended that ‘‘a large part 
1
of the success of the communications of this Army 
2
is due to . . . a competent staff of women opera-
3
tors.’’. 
4
(22) After the war ended, some women were or-
5
dered to Coblenz in Germany for the occupation of 
6
that country and to Paris for the Paris Peace Trea-
7
ty of 1919 to continue telephone operations, some-
8
times in direct support of President Woodrow Wil-
9
son. 
10
(23) Two operators, Corah Bartlett and Inez 
11
Crittenden, died in France in the service of the 
12
United States and were buried there in military 
13
cemeteries with military ceremonies. Those operators 
14
died of the same influenza pandemic that killed more 
15
soldiers of the Armed Forces than combat oper-
16
ations. 
17
(24) Women of the Army Signal Corps were in-
18
eligible for discharge until formal release. Because of 
19
their role in logistics, those women were among the 
20
last soldiers to come home to the United States. The 
21
last Signal Corps operators returned from France in 
22
January of 1920. 
23
(25) Upon arrival in the United States, the 
24
Army informed female veterans that they had per-
25
18:50 Aug 12, 2021

•HR 4949 IH
formed as civilians, not soldiers, even though opera-
1
tors had served in Army uniform in a theater of war 
2
surrounded by men who were similarly engaged. 
3
(26) Despite the objections of General George 
4
Squier, the top-ranking officer in the Signal Corps, 
5
the Army denied Signal Corps women the veterans’ 
6
benefits granted to male soldiers and female nurses, 
7
such as— 
8
(A) hospitalization for disabilities incurred 
9
in the line of duty; 
10
(B) cash bonuses; 
11
(C) soldiers’ pensions; 
12
(D) flags on their coffins; and 
13
(E) the Victory Medals promised them in 
14
France. 
15
(27) For the next 60 years, female veterans, led 
16
by Merle Egan from Montana, petitioned Congress 
17
more than 50 times for their recognition. In 1977, 
18
under the sponsorship of Senator Barry Goldwater, 
19
Congress passed legislation to retroactively acknowl-
20
edge the military service of the Women’s Airforce 
21
Service Pilots (referred to in this section as 
22
‘‘WASPs’’) of World War II and ‘‘the service of any 
23
person in any other similarly situated group the 
24
members of which rendered service to the Armed 
25

10 
•HR 4949 IH
Forces of the United States in a capacity considered 
1
civilian employment or contractual service at the 
2
time such service was rendered’’. 
3
(28) On November 23, 1977, President Jimmy 
4
Carter signed the legislation described in paragraph 
5
(27) into law as the GI Bill Improvement Act of 
6
1977 (Public Law 95–202; 91 Stat. 1433). 
7
(29) The Signal Corps telephone operators ap-
8
plied for, and were granted, status as veterans in 
9
1979. 
10
(30) Only 33 of the operators who had returned 
11
home after the war were still alive to receive their 
12
Victory Medals and official discharge papers, which 
13
were finally awarded in 1979. 
14
(31) One of the women, Olive Shaw from Mas-
15
sachusetts, returned to the United States after the 
16
war, where she worked on the professional staff of 
17
Congresswoman Edith Nourse Rogers. Shaw lived to 
18
receive her honorable discharge and was the first 
19
burial when the Massachusetts National Cemetery 
20
opened on October 11, 1980. Shaw’s uniform is on 
21
display at the National World War I Museum and 
22
Memorial in Kansas City, Missouri. 
23
(32) Upon receipt of her honorable discharge at 
24
a ceremony in her home in Marine City, Michigan,

‘‘Hello Girl’’ Oleda Joure Christides raised the paper 
1
to her lips and kissed it. The only thing Christides 
2
ever wanted from the Federal Government was a 
3
flag on her coffin. 
4
(33) On July 1, 2009, President Barack Obama 
5
signed into law Public Law 111–40 (123 Stat. 
6
1958), which awarded the WASPs the Congressional 
7
Gold Medal for their service to the United States. 
8
(34) For their role as pioneers who paved the 
9
way for all women in uniform, and for service that 
10
was essential to victory in World War I, the ‘‘Hello 
11
Girls’’ merit similar recognition.
