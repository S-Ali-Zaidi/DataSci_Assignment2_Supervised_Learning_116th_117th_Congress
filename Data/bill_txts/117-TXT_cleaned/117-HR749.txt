RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the outstanding contributions of respiratory 
therapists to patient care during ‘‘National Respiratory 
Care Week’’. 
Whereas respiratory therapists are front-line experts in venti-
lator management and have worked tirelessly to care for 
patients in critical need during the ongoing COVID–19 
public health emergency; 
Whereas respiratory therapists are the only allied health pro-
fessionals clinically educated in all aspects of pulmonary 
medicine and who treat and care for patients with defi-
ciencies and abnormalities of the cardiopulmonary sys-
tem;

Whereas respiratory therapists’ expertise is applicable in 
many settings, including, but not limited to, various inpa-
tient and outpatient facilities (such as acute care, urgent 
care, long-term care, subacute care, skilled nursing facili-
ties), physicians’ offices, sleep laboratories and clinics, 
and patients’ homes; and 
Whereas respiratory therapists’ invaluable contributions to 
the health care system and their patients’ health and 
well-being too often go unrecognized: Now, therefore, be 
it
