Whereas the United Nations General Assembly proclaimed

Rights Council adopted by consensus Resolution 43/1 on 
the ‘‘Promotion and protection of the human rights and 
fundamental freedoms of Africans and people of African 
descent against excessive use of force and other human 
rights violations by law enforcement officers’’; 
Whereas pursuant to that resolution, United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet re-
leased a report on systemic racism and police brutality 
against Africans and people of African descent at the 
hands of law enforcement around the world, which exam-
ined such cases in 62 countries including the United 
States; 
Whereas that report acknowledges the ‘‘stark socioeconomic 
and political marginalization’’ experienced by people of 
African descent in communities around the world as a re-
sult of persistent racial discrimination and structural in-
equalities; 
Whereas the report establishes a four-point agenda toward 
transformative change for racial justice and equality and 
calls on member states to— 
(1) reverse cultures of denial, dismantle systemic 
racism, and accelerate the pace of action; 
(2) end impunity for human rights violations by law 
enforcement officials and close trust deficits in this area; 
(3) ensure that the voices of people of African de-
scent and those who stand up against racism are heard 
and that their concerns are acted upon; and 
(4) acknowledge and confront legacies, including 
through accountability and redress; 
Whereas High Commissioner Bachelet stated on July 12, 
2021, that there is ‘‘an urgent need to confront the leg-

racial justice and equality’’, now informally known as the 
‘‘George Floyd Resolution’’;
