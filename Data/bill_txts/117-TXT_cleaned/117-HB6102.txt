Congress finds the following: 
4
(1) Black lung disease has been the underlying 
5
or contributing cause of death of more than 79,000 
6

•HR 6102 IH
miners since 1968. The Black Lung Benefits Act 
1
(30 U.S.C. 901 et seq.) was enacted to provide 
2
health care and modest benefits to coal miners who 
3
develop pneumoconiosis (referred to in this section 
4
as ‘‘black lung disease’’) resulting from exposure to 
5
coal mine dust during their employment. Yet the de-
6
termination of a claimant’s eligibility for these bene-
7
fits often requires complex, adversarial litigation. 
8
Resource disparities between coal companies and 
9
claimants are widespread within the statutory and 
10
regulatory framework of such Act. Comprehensive 
11
reforms are necessary to ensure that coal miners are 
12
not at a disadvantage when filing claims for benefits. 
13
(2) The Government Accountability Office has 
14
found that many claimants under the Black Lung 
15
Benefits Act are not equipped with the medical and 
16
legal resources necessary to develop evidence to meet 
17
the requirements for benefits. Miners often lack 
18
complete and reliable medical evidence, consequently 
19
increasing the risk that the individuals who review 
20
claims for benefits will be presented with insufficient 
21
medical evidence. Similarly, without better options 
22
for legal representation, significant numbers of 
23
claimants proceed with their claims through a com-
24
plex and potentially long administrative process 
25
17:14 Dec 16, 2021
H6102
4 
•HR 6102 IH
without resources that Department of Labor officials 
1
and black lung disease experts note are important 
2
for developing evidence and supporting their claims. 
3
In 2020, only 42 percent of claimants were rep-
4
resented by an attorney during the initial claims de-
5
termination. Absent efforts to remedy administrative 
6
problems and address structural weaknesses in the 
7
process for obtaining benefits, claimants with meri-
8
torious claims will not receive benefits. 
9
(3) Full exchange and disclosure between the 
10
parties of relevant medical information is essential 
11
for fair adjudication of claims under the Black Lung 
12
Benefits Act, regardless of whether the parties in-
13
tend to submit such information into evidence. 
14
Records of adjudications reveal that some mine oper-
15
ators’ legal representatives have withheld relevant 
16
evidence from claimants, administrative law judges, 
17
and, in some cases, even their own medical experts. 
18
In several cases, the disclosure of such evidence 
19
would have substantiated a miner’s claim for bene-
20
fits. Withholding medical information can endanger 
21
miners by depriving them of important information 
22
about their own health and the potential need to 
23
seek medical treatment. 
24

•HR 6102 IH
(4) Given the remedial nature of the Black 
1
Lung Benefits Act, when an adjudicator determines 
2
that evidence is evenly balanced, it is appropriate for 
3
any resulting doubt to be resolved in favor of the 
4
claimant. The Supreme Court vacated this long-
5
standing legal principle, not on substantive grounds, 
6
but because its application conflicted with the re-
7
quirements of another statute. Such principle needs 
8
to be reinstated in the Black Lung Benefits Act be-
9
cause it provides fairness and improves the adminis-
10
tration of benefits. 
11
(5) Physicians who read lung x-rays as part of 
12
pulmonary assessments used in proceedings for 
13
claims under the Black Lung Benefits Act are re-
14
quired to demonstrate competency in classifying 
15
chest radiographs by becoming certified as B Read-
16
ers by the National Institute for Occupational Safety 
17
and Health (referred to in this section as 
18
‘‘NIOSH’’). However, investigations have uncovered 
19
that there are NIOSH-certified B Readers who have 
20
systematically misclassified chest radiographs while 
21
employed by coal operators or their law firms for the 
22
purpose of opposing claims under such Act. In re-
23
sponse, the Department of Labor has directed claims 
24
examiners ‘‘not to credit negative chest x-ray read-
25
17:14 Dec 16, 2021
H6102
6 
•HR 6102 IH
ings for pneumoconiosis’’ by one widely used physi-
1
cian employed at a prominent medical center unless 
2
the conclusions of such physician ‘‘have been reha-
3
bilitated’’. Where chest radiographs are needed to 
4
establish entitlement to benefits, claimants should 
5
have access to accurate interpretations so as to en-
6
sure the fair adjudication of such claims. 
7
(6) Since survivors were denied benefits on 
8
claims under the Black Lung Benefits Act that in-
9
volved the consideration of chest radiograph inter-
10
pretations rendered by a certain physician whose in-
11
terpretations have since been determined by the De-
12
partment of Labor to be generally not worthy of 
13
credit, such survivors should be permitted to file a 
14
new claim for benefits under such Act. However, a 
15
survivor is effectively barred from filing a new claim 
16
one year after a decision regarding such benefits is 
17
final, constituting an injustice that merits a remedy. 
18
(7) Benefit payments under the Black Lung 
19
Benefits Act do not automatically increase with the 
20
rising cost of living. Benefit payments are tied to the 
21
monthly pay rate for Federal employees in grade 
22
GS–2, step 1. In 2011 through 2013, there was a 
23
pay freeze for Federal employees, which had the ef-
24
fect of eliminating cost-of-living adjustments for 
25

H6102
7 
•HR 6102 IH
miners, surviving spouses, and dependents under the 
1
Black Lung Benefits Act during such years. 
2
(8) A competent assessment of medical infor-
3
mation and testimony, which often involves multiple 
4
physicians disputing a diagnosis, is necessary in de-
5
termining whether to award benefits under the 
6
Black Lung Benefits Act. To ensure that a deter-
7
mination regarding a claim for benefits under such 
8
Act is fair and accurate, regular training is needed 
9
regarding— 
10
(A) developments in pulmonary medicine 
11
relating to black lung disease; 
12
(B) medical evidence necessary to sustain 
13
claims for such benefits; and 
14
(C) the proper weight to be given to con-
15
flicting evidence. 
16
(9) To eliminate an avoidable delay in evalu-
17
ating claims under such Act, the Department of La-
18
bor’s Inspector General has recommended legislation 
19
that would authorize the Department of Labor to 
20
have electronic access to miners’ earning records 
21
held by the Social Security Administration.
