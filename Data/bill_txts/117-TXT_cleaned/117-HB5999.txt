SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds that— 
2
(1) conditions inherent to traveling perform-
3
ances, including constant travel, temporary and col-
4
lapsible facilities, and the prolonged confinement 
5
and physical coercion of animals, subject exotic and 
6
wild animals to compromised welfare and chronic 
7
stress, and present public and worker health and 
8
safety risks not adequately addressed by current reg-
9
ulations; 
10
(2) current regulatory oversight of traveling 
11
performances is complex and costly, and those costs 
12
are not typically recouped via licensing fees but are 
13
left to the taxpayer; 
14
(3) the frequent mobility of traveling perform-
15
ances complicates oversight such that agencies and 
16
authorities cannot properly monitor, evaluate, or fol-
17
low through regarding the condition of animals or 
18
facilities, or their history of potential injuries, inci-
19
dents, illnesses, violations, or other issues, and so 
20
cannot properly protect animals, workers, or the 
21
public; 
22
(4) traveling exotic and wild animal perform-
23
ances use collapsible, temporary, mobile facilities, 
24
which risk escape and serious harm to animals, 
25
workers, and the public; 
26
22:18 Jan 11, 2022
H5999
3 
HR 5999 IH1S 
(5) traveling exotic and wild animal perform-
1
ances present safety risks by permitting or not pre-
2
venting public contact and by displaying animals in 
3
inappropriate, uncontrolled areas in dangerous prox-
4
imity to humans and other animals; 
5
(6) exotic and wild animals have intrinsic value; 
6
(7) the wild instincts and needs of exotic and 
7
wild animals are unpredictable and not naturally 
8
suited to traveling performances, and exotic and wild 
9
animals thus suffer as a result of being unable to 
10
fulfill instinctive natural behaviors; 
11
(8) exotic and wild animals used in traveling 
12
performances suffer severe and extended confine-
13
ment, and, deprived of natural movements and be-
14
haviors, are prone to chronic stress and behavioral, 
15
health, and psychological problems; 
16
(9) exotic and wild animals are forced to per-
17
form unnatural tricks requiring extreme physical co-
18
ercion, including the use of food and water restric-
19
tions, electric shock devices, bullhooks, metal bars, 
20
whips, shovels, pitchforks, and other abuses; 
21
(10) it is not necessary to use exotic or wild 
22
animals in traveling performances to experience the 
23
circus or similar events; 
24
22:18 Jan 11, 2022
H5999
4 
HR 5999 IH1S 
(11) using exotic or wild animals as commod-
1
ities traded for traveling performances adds nothing 
2
to the understanding and conservation of those ani-
3
mals and the natural environment, and actually un-
4
dermines conservation efforts necessary to protect 
5
threatened and endangered species; 
6
(12) it is not possible to provide or ensure pub-
7
lic and worker safety or appropriate physical and 
8
mental welfare of exotic and wild animals under the 
9
traveling performance business model, which inher-
10
ently and significantly restricts the natural move-
11
ments and behaviors of animals, and in which abuse 
12
is prevalent and oversight problematic; 
13
(13) the use of exotic or wild animals in trav-
14
eling performances is or substantially affects inter-
15
state or foreign commerce and the free flow of inter-
16
state or foreign commerce; 
17
(14) it is essential to regulate the use of exotic 
18
or wild animals in traveling performances to ensure 
19
the humane care and treatment of animals; and 
20
(15) restricting the use of exotic and wild ani-
21
mals in traveling performances is the most cost-ef-
22
fective and efficient way to safeguard animals, work-
23
ers, and the public.
