Whereas, for over 40 years, ‘‘National Crime Victims’ Rights 
Week’’ has recognized and validated the impact of crime 
on victims and survivors, and those who assist them; 
Whereas the 2022 theme of ‘‘National Crime Victims’ Rights 
Week’’, ‘‘Rights, access, equity for all victims’’, reflects 
the national approach that is needed to ensure that crime 
survivors’ needs are identified and addressed; 
Whereas crime victims’ advocates and service providers help 
crime survivors by providing them with information about 
their rights and how to exercise them; 
Whereas crime victims’ advocates and service providers in-
crease access to services and support for survivors by 
working together to eliminate barriers to the ability to 
know about and receive quality, comprehensive services, 
including the elimination of barriers related to age, gen-
der, ethnicity, race, faith, geography, socioeconomic sta-
tus, sexual orientation, or disability; 
Whereas equity in victim or survivor services requires the 
people of the United States, individually and collectively, 
to recognize that every single person who is harmed by 
crime, whether they report it to law enforcement or not, 
deserves to be treated with fairness, dignity, respect, and 
support; and 
Whereas the Congressional Crime Survivors and Justice Cau-
cus and Congress commit to the adoption of policies and 
programs that identify and meet the needs of crime sur-
vivors across the United States, including the strength-
ening and protection of the Victims of Crime Act, the 
Crime Victims’ Rights Act, and the Violence Against 
Women Act: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
