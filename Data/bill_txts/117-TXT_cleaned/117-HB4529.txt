SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The free exercise of religion is an inalien-
3
able right, protected by the First Amendment of the 
4
United States Constitution. 
5
(2) Congress reaffirmed this right in the Reli-
6
gious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, as amended 
7
in 2000, which prohibits the Federal Government 
8
from imposing a substantial burden on the free exer-
9
cise of religion unless it demonstrates that a compel-
10
ling government interest is achieved by the least re-
11
strictive means. 
12
(3) Many people immigrated to America (in-
13
cluding members of the Quaker, Mennonite, and 
14
Church of the Brethren faiths) to escape persecution 
15
for their refusal to participate in warfare, yet during 
16
the First World War hundreds of conscientious ob-
17
jectors were imprisoned in America for their beliefs. 
18
Some died while incarcerated as a result of mistreat-
19
ment. 
20
(4) During the Second World War, ‘‘alternative 
21
civilian service’’ was established in lieu of military 
22
service, by the Selective Training and Service Act of 
23
1940, to accommodate a wide spectrum of religious 
24
beliefs and practices. Subsequent case law also has 
25
expanded these exemptions, and has described this

policy as one of ‘‘. . . long standing tradition in this 
1
country . . .’’ affording ‘‘the important value of rec-
2
onciling individuality of belief with practical exigen-
3
cies whenever possible. It dates back to colonial 
4
times and has been perpetuated in State and Fed-
5
eral conscription statutes’’, and ‘‘has roots deeply 
6
embedded in history’’ (Welsh v. United States, 1970, 
7
Justice Harlan concurring). During and since the 
8
Second World War thousands of conscientious objec-
9
tors provided essential staff for mental hospitals and 
10
volunteered as human test subjects for arduous med-
11
ical experiments, and provided other service for the 
12
national health, safety and interest. 
13
(5) Conscientious objectors have sought alter-
14
native service for their tax payments since that time. 
15
They request legal relief from government seizure of 
16
their homes, livestock, automobiles, and other prop-
17
erty; and from having bank accounts attached, 
18
wages garnished, fines imposed, and imprisonment 
19
threatened, to compel them to violate their personal 
20
and religious convictions. 
21
(6) Conscientious objection to participation in 
22
war in any form based upon moral, ethical, or reli-
23
gious beliefs is recognized in Federal law, with provi-
24
sion for alternative service; but no such provision ex-
25

ists for taxpayers who are conscientious objectors 
1
and who are compelled to participate in war through 
2
the payment of taxes to support military activities. 
3
(7) The Joint Committee on Taxation has cer-
4
tified that a tax trust fund, providing for conscien-
5
tious objector taxpayers to pay their full taxes for 
6
nonmilitary purposes, would increase Federal reve-
7
nues.
