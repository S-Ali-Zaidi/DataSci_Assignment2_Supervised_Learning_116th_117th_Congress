Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Gun Records Restora-
4
tion and Preservation Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
The Congress finds as follows: 
7
(1) The Tiahrt Amendments prevent the collec-
8
tion of valuable information, and the establishment

of effective policies to prevent illegal guns from 
1
being used in crimes. 
2
(2) The Tiahrt Amendments impede enforce-
3
ment of the gun laws by requiring most background 
4
check records to be destroyed within 24 hours, and 
5
by barring the Federal Government from requiring 
6
annual inventory audits by owners of gun shops. 
7
(3) A 2012 study by researchers at Johns Hop-
8
kins Bloomberg School of Public Health found that 
9
the Tiahrt Amendments dramatically increased gun 
10
trafficking to the criminal market. 
11
(4) A 2016 study from the University of Pitts-
12
burgh Graduate School of Public Health found that 
13
in 2008, 79 percent of all guns recovered by police 
14
from crime scenes belonged to someone other than 
15
the perpetrator—30 percent had been stolen. 
16
(5) Every year, more than 123,000 Americans 
17
are shot. 
18
(6) 2020 was one of the deadliest years on 
19
record for the United States, with an estimated 
20
19,300 people killed in firearm homicides or non-sui-
21
cide related shootings, which is a 25-percent increase 
22
over 2019.

•HR 2282 IH
(7) In 2019, 58.9 percent of firearm homicide 
1
victims were Black and 15.9 percent of firearm 
2
homicide victims were Hispanic. 
3
(8) In 2019, the National Tracing Center at 
4
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Ex-
5
plosives processed 450,000 trace requests on fire-
6
arms from Federal, State, and local law enforce-
7
ment. 
8
(9) Having effective policies to prevent illegal 
9
gun trafficking makes our families and communities 
10
safer. 
11
(10) Repealing the Tiahrt Amendments would 
12
support law enforcement efforts and give the public 
13
vital information needed to craft the most effective 
14
policies against illegal guns.
