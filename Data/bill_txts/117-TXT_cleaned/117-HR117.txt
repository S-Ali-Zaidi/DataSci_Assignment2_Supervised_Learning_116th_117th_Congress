Whereas St. Mark brought Christianity to Egypt, where Cop-
tic Christians have been one of the indigenous people of

Whereas there are over 10,000,000 Copts in Egypt, making 
the Copts the largest Christian and the largest non-Mus-
lim community in the Middle East; 
Whereas Copts and other Christians have been targets of so-
cietal aggression resulting in the loss of life, property, 
and the destruction of churches;

to make an appearance at a Coptic Christian Christmas 
liturgy; 
Whereas, in August 2016, Egypt passed Law 80 to stream-
line the church construction process; 
Whereas, as of January 2021, according to the United States 
Commission on International Religious Freedom, of the 
approximately 5,500 unlicensed churches and religious 
buildings awaiting legalization, authorities have condi-
tionally recognized approximately 1,800; 
Whereas Coptic Christians face discrimination in Egypt’s 
public-sector employment, including the police force, 
armed services, education, the judiciary, and the foreign 
service; 
Whereas Coptic Christians face discrimination in Egypt’s 
athletics, including the Egyptian Olympic team, on the 
national, reserve, and youth football teams, and in the 
Egyptian premier soccer league; 
Whereas violence against Coptic Christians, particularly in 
local villages, is rarely punished, making Copts more sus-
ceptible to attacks; 
Whereas Egyptian Government officials frequently participate 
in informal reconciliation sessions to address incidents of 
sectarian violence or tension, saying that such sessions 
prevented further violence; 
Whereas according to human rights groups, the reconciliation 
sessions have regularly led to outcomes unfavorable to re-
ligious minorities and precluded recourse to the judicial 
system by such minorities; 
Whereas civil society institutions, women’s rights organiza-
tions, nongovernmental organizations (both national and

foreign) have been shut down or their activities severely 
curtailed; 
Whereas journalists, thinkers, and dissenters, such as Ramy 
Kamel and Patrick Zaki, have been imprisoned indefi-
nitely, detained without trial, or are subject to a revolving 
door of arrest, interrogation, pretrial detention and re-
newal hearings at which many prisoners have their deten-
tions automatically renewed (for months or even years) 
without evidence, and re-arrest after release orders have 
been given; 
Whereas United States diplomatic leadership contributes 
meaningfully and materially to the international protec-
tion of religious minorities and their faith-based practices 
and places of worship; 
Whereas the United States has a strong interest in combat-
ting the threat of Islamic terrorism and ensuring the sta-
bility of the region; and 
Whereas religious freedom and human rights are essential 
cornerstones of democracy that promote respect for indi-
vidual liberty and contribute to greater stability and are 
priority values for the United States in promoting its en-
gagement with other countries: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
