SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress makes the following findings: 
7
(1) The Federal Government’s reliance on con-
8
tractors for mission support services can create the 
9
potential for conflicts of interest related to impaired

objectivity or undue influence due to contractor busi-
1
ness relationships with regulated or other entities. 
2
(2) Comptroller General bid protest decisions in 
3
recent years have shown failures in proper identifica-
4
tion and mitigation of organizational conflicts of in-
5
terest. These decisions focus on the issue of ‘‘im-
6
paired objectivity’’ in contract support, or a situa-
7
tion in which a contractor is unable to provide im-
8
partial recommendations and advice to the Govern-
9
ment due to competing interests of the contractor. 
10
(3) Prior efforts by the Administrator for Fed-
11
eral Procurement Policy and the Director of the Of-
12
fice of Government Ethics, undertaken pursuant to 
13
the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization 
14
Act for Fiscal Year 2009 (Public Law 110–417), 
15
have determined that changes are needed to the 
16
Federal Acquisition Regulation to prevent and miti-
17
gate conflicts of interest in Federal contracting. 
18
(4) Protecting against conflicts of interest in 
19
Federal acquisition is vital to the integrity of Gov-
20
ernment operations.
