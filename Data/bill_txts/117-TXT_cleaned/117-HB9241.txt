1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2

4
Security in Export Controls Act of 2022’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress makes the following findings:

•HR 9241 IH
(1) In 2018 Congress on an overwhelming bi-
1
partisan basis passed the Export Control Reform 
2
Act of 2018 requiring the Department of Commerce 
3
to tighten restrictions on transfers of emerging and 
4
foundational technologies to high risk countries, es-
5
pecially China, but there has been little progress 
6
ever since. 
7
(2) The Department of Commerce has shown 
8
itself inept to reconcile its mission to protect United 
9
States national security with its objective of pro-
10
moting United States exports to high-risk countries, 
11
especially China. 
12
(3) By August 2022, a Department of Com-
13
merce-led process that reviews United States tech-
14
nology exports to China has approved almost all re-
15
quests and has overseen an increase in sales of some 
16
particularly important technologies. 
17
(4) There are only 70 Chinese entities on the 
18
Department of Commerce’s current entity list, de-
19
spite that tens of thousands of Chinese entities may 
20
meet the United States criteria for military end-user 
21
export restrictions. 
22
(5) The Bureau of Industry and Security, re-
23
sponsible for enforcing export control under the De-
24
partment of Commerce, has not taken a single ac-
25

•HR 9241 IH
tion since the passing of the Export Control Reform 
1
Act of 2018 to restrict foundational technology from 
2
being transferred to China. 
3
(6) In May 2022, the Bureau of Industry and 
4
Security dropped foundational technology as a cri-
5
terion, culminating its defiance of Congress. 
6
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
7
It is the sense of Congress that export control author-
8
ity should be taken away from the Bureau of Industry and 
9
Security of the Department of Commerce since the Bu-
10
reau has manifestly been unable to resolve the conflict of 
11
interest between promoting trade and protecting United 
12
States national security through enforcing restrictions on 
13
technology transfer to high-risk countries, especially 
14
China.
