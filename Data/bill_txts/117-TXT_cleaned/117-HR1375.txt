RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the history between Haiti and France, acknowl-
edging Haiti as the first free Black nation in the Amer-
icas, recognizing how the aftermath of their freedom 
is directly related to their impoverished state today, and 
realizing the importance of this history. 
Whereas the revolutionary movement in Haiti was the first 
successful slave revolution in 1791, freeing itself from 
French rule; 
Whereas Haiti established an independent nation in 1804, 
decades before other colonies and nations fought against 
their enslavement;

Whereas, in 1825, French warships appeared on the coast of 
Port-au-Prince with an ultimatum from French King 
Charles X to give reparations to former slave masters or 
face another war; 
Whereas Haiti’s President Jean-Pierre Boyer agreed in an ef-
fort to avoid war and begin trade with other countries; 
Whereas, for generations after independence, Haitians were 
forced to pay the descendants of their former slave mas-
ters, becoming the world’s first and only country to have 
‘‘independence debt’’; 
Whereas these payments extended to the Empress of Brazil, 
the son-in-law of the Russian Emperor Nicholas I, Ger-
many’s last imperial chancellor Otto von Bismarck, and 
French general Gaston de Galliffet; 
Whereas the first installment of payment was six times the 
country’s income; 
Whereas Haiti was forced to take out loans from French 
banks to make payments, creating ‘‘double debt’’; 
Whereas, historically, Haitian leaders have ransacked the 
country for their own gain, as legislators have spoken 
openly on the radio about accepting bribes and oligarchs 
sit atop lucrative monopolies; 
Whereas Transparency International ranks Haiti among the 
most corrupt countries in the world; 
Whereas Haitians have paid about $560,000,000 in today’s 
dollars toward the double debt; 
Whereas most workers in Haiti have never had running water 
or septic tanks; 
Whereas public hospitals lack the most essential supplies, like 
blood pressure cuffs or thermometers; and
