•HRES 406 IH 
‘‘Additional Subpoena Enforcement Power 
1
‘‘7.(a) Whenever any committee or subcommittee 
2
makes a written request to any department or agency of 
3
the Government for the attendance of named witnesses or 
4
the production of such books, records, correspondence, 
5
memorandum, papers, documents, and electronic or digital 
6
files, data or information, in any form, including any elec-
7
tronic or digital files, data or information in any search-
8
able formats in which they are available to or can be pro-
9
duced by the agency, as the committee or subcommittee 
10
considers necessary, a senior responsible official shall ei-
11
ther comply with that request or file written objections 
12
within the time frame for response set forth in the request. 
13
‘‘(b) If the senior responsible official files written ob-
14
jections within the timeframe for response, the committee 
15
or subcommittee shall seek to resolve these objections 
16
through negotiation and accommodation. If a resolution 
17
cannot be reached, staff shall so certify to the chair of 
18
the committee. 
19
‘‘(c) If the senior responsible official fails to file ob-
20
jections or make available the designated witnesses or full 
21
production of responsive records and information within 
22
the timeframe for response, the chair of the committee 
23
may issue a subpoena to the senior responsible official for

any unproduced records or information as to which no ob-

jection was filed, and to any designated witness to which 
1
no objection was filed. 
2
‘‘(d) With respect to any portion of the written re-
3
quest for documents and witnesses to which timely objec-
4
tion was made, a subpoena to the senior responsible offi-
5
cial and to designated witnesses, may be issued, following 
6
conclusion of the negotiations referred to in paragraph (b),

by—

‘‘(1) the chair, upon 48 hours notice to the 
9
ranking member, unless the ranking member objects 
10
during that period; or 
11
‘‘(2) a vote of the committee. 
12
‘‘(e) The senior responsible official and other wit-
13
nesses to whom a subpoena is issued have the right to 
14
be accompanied only by non-government private counsel 
15
during all proceedings conducted pursuant to this clause 
16
(even if the witness is a government official or employee). 
17
The committee in taking testimony will follow the proce-
18
dures for taking depositions and resolving disputes over 
19
objections to questions that are prescribed by the House 
20
Rules Committee for such testimonial proceedings [see 
21
165 Cong. Rec. H1216–17 (Jan. 25, 2019)].

sonally and in writing asserts a claim of executive privilege 
1
with respect to the records, information, and witnesses at 
2
issue, the committee may hold a hearing to consider these 
3
objections. The senior responsible official shall personally 
4
attend this hearing but may not assert Executive Privilege 
5
on behalf of the President, and the committee chair may 
6
grant an exception for good cause shown. 
7
‘‘(g) If the committee overrules some or all of the ob-
8
jections asserted, it may issue an order of compliance 
9
which states the grounds for rejection of the objections, 
10
the date for compliance, and an advisement of the legal 
11
consequences of a failure to comply. The senior responsible 
12
official and subpoenaed witnesses shall comply with such 
13
order within the timeframe for response. If prior to such 
14
time, the President asserts a claim of executive privilege, 
15
it shall be made personally and in writing, and will be con-
16
sidered by the committee with all other timely objections. 
17
Witnesses may not assert a claim of executive privilege 
18
in the absence of such an assertion by the President. 
19
‘‘(h) On the failure of the senior responsible official 
20
or subpoenaed witnesses to comply with the order, the 
21
committee shall meet to assess whether the noncompliance 
22
rises to the level of a breach of the constitutional privilege 
23
and duty of the House to be fully informed in order to 
24
properly perform its legislative responsibilities without

undue obstruction and thereby warrants condemnation 
1
and punishment. If so, the committee shall report a privi-
2
leged resolution of contempt. The accompanying report 
3
shall include a detailed history and nature of the con-
4
troversy and attempts at accommodation; the legal issues 
5
raised; the legislative need for the information sought; the 
6
legal and practical reasons for the determination that the 
7
objections were rejected; and the recommended monetary 
8
penalties. 
9
‘‘(i) If the committee reports a resolution of con-
10
tempt, it shall be treated as a rule IX question of privilege 
11
of the House requiring precedence over all other questions 
12
until resolved and promptly scheduled for floor consider-
13
ation. The chair of the committee shall present the case 
14
for passage of the resolution. At the conclusion of the al-
15
lotted period for presentations, questions and debate, a 
16
vote on passage of the resolution will be taken. If the vote 
17
is for passage, a second vote will be taken on the commit-
18
tee’s recommendation for imposition of a monetary pen-
19
alty. A proffer of an amendment to alter the recommended 
20
penalty is in order. 
21
‘‘(j)(1) Upon House passage of the resolution of con-
22
tempt the contemnor shall be assessed by the body an ini-
23
tial penalty of not more than $25,000 and total penalties 
24
of not more than $100,000. The amount of the ultimate 
25

•HRES 406 IH 
penalty depends on timeliness of the contemnor’s compli-
1
ance in providing information withheld. The initial penalty 
2
of not more than $25,000 may be increased by the com-
3
mittee chair by increments of not more than $25,000 after 
4
a one-time waiting period of 10 calendar days from the 
5
initial penalty until the $100,000 maximum is reached. 
6
The 10-day period shall only be observed after the first 
7
penalty. Upon expiration of the 10-day waiting period, if 
8
the chair deems the measure of compliance by the 
9
contemnor is insufficient to satisfy the legislative needs 
10
of the committee, the chair may, over a period of not more 
11
than fifteen days, at his or her discretion, increase the 
12
penalty by increments of not more than $25,000 until the 
13
maximum is reached. Upon expiration of the 10-day wait-
14
ing period, the General Counsel is authorized to recover 
15
any accrued penalties, but only if the contemnor has failed 
16
to comply with the subpoena before the end of such 10- 
17
day period. Nothing in this clause shall be interpreted to 
18
limit the ability of the House to impose additional legisla-
19
tive punishments on the contemnor for noncompliance.

‘‘(2) No appropriated funds, funds provided from any 
21
accounts in the Treasury, funds derived from collection 
22

a monetary penalty imposed by the House under this

clause.

penalty imposed by the House. Nor shall any person,

group, entity, organization, or corporation be permitted to 
6
pay any monetary penalties directly on behalf of a

contemnor. The House may regard such actions to com-

pensate, reimburse or provide remunerations or payments

to a contemnor as an obstruction of its investigative and

information gathering prerogatives and responsibilities 
11
and a contempt of the House.
