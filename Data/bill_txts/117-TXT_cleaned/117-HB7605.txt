SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
1
The sense of Congress is the following: 
2
(1) The preservation of Presidential records (as 
3
defined in section 2201 of title 44, United States 
4
Code) is a legal obligation for every Presidential ad-
5
ministration, as Presidential records are the most 
6
important and widely used source for studying how 
7
the executive branch of the Federal Government 
8
works, how it has changed over time, and how it 
9
might evolve to serve the needs of a new era. 
10
(2) The preservation of Presidential records is 
11
therefore vital for— 
12
(A) the public to be able to understand 
13
and learn from the past; 
14
(B) future policymaking to build on the 
15
past administration’s successes and experience; 
16
(C) ensuring accountability for results, 
17
performance, and conduct; and 
18
(D) other purposes that serve to strength-
19
en American democracy. 
20
(3) Any effort to destroy, alter, or remove Pres-
21
idential records in violation of chapter 22 of title 44, 
22
United States Code— 
23
(A) threatens the values described in para-
24
graph (2); and 
25
16:33 Apr 29, 2022
H7605

•HR 7605 IH
(B) may subject a person engaging in such 
1
efforts to other criminal penalties under section 
2
641 or 2071 of title 18, United States Code. 
3
(4) The lawful disposal of Presidential records 
4
that no longer have administrative, historical, infor-
5
mational, or evidentiary value must follow a process 
6
as described in section 2203 of title 44, United 
7
States Code. 
8
(5) What constitutes a Presidential record is 
9
determined solely by whether the record relates to 
10
the ‘‘carrying out of constitutional, statutory, or 
11
other official or ceremonial duties of the President’’, 
12
as indicated in the definition of the term ‘‘Presi-
13
dential records’’ in section 2201 of title 44, United 
14
States Code, and by the content of the information 
15
contained in the record. 
16
(6) For communication between agencies and 
17
the Executive Office of the President, the copy of 
18
the record belonging to the agency is retained as an 
19
agency record pursuant to section 3301 of title 44, 
20
United States Code. 
21
(7) Consistent with section 2203 of title 44, 
22
United States Code, any Presidential records created 
23
with non-official electronic media shall be ‘‘pre-
24
served’’, which includes a comprehensive documenta-
25

•HR 7605 IH
tion of all records and associated metadata and at-
1
tachments. 
2
(8) Applications or software with an automatic 
3
deleting functionality are antithetical to the legal 
4
and historical obligations described under chapter 22 
5
of title 44, United States Code. 
6
(9) Periods of Presidential transition are mo-
7
ments where the national security of the United 
8
States is most vulnerable, necessitating an early, 
9
good faith, and consistent commitment by the out-
10
going administration to ensure continuity of oper-
11
ations as it relates to national security and pro-
12
tecting critical infrastructure, among other reasons. 
13
(10) Agencies and the Executive Office of the 
14
President are required by law to cooperate with the 
15
Archivist of the United States and the Federal 
16
Transition Coordinator of the General Service Ad-
17
ministration, who is tasked with ensuring agencies 
18
comply with all statutory requirements relating to 
19
transition planning under section 4(c) of the Presi-
20
dential Transition Act of 1963 (3 U.S.C. 102 note). 
21
(11) During a Presidential transition, Presi-
22
dential records, which contain valuable information 
23
regarding agreements or negotiations with foreign 
24
governments and international organizations and the 
25
16:33 Apr 29, 2022
H7605
5 
•HR 7605 IH
actions and beliefs of foreign nations or actors are 
1
of enormous value to the national security. 
2
(12) Any effort to delay briefings, coordination, 
3
and sharing information regarding key national se-
4
curity relationships, threats, and operations with an 
5
incoming administration or the destruction, removal, 
6
or alteration of Presidential records that attest to 
7
the information described in this section could pose 
8
a grave danger to the national security. 
9
(13) An expeditious ascertainment of the plau-
10
sible President-elect and Vice-President-elect by the 
11
Administrator of General Services plays a vital role 
12
in ensuring continuity of Government and protecting 
13
national security such that the risk of redundant ex-
14
penditure is overwhelmed by the advantages of an 
15
early access to transition resources to allow for tran-
16
sition planning. 
17
(14) The National Archives and Records Ad-
18
ministration plays an essential role in ensuring the 
19
official proceedings of Government are documented 
20
to improve democracy in the United States, protect 
21
national security, provide continuity of Government 
22
during a transition, and promote accountability for 
23
actions taking during a Presidency.

(15) The robust funding of the National Ar-

2
its officers and employees from political interference

is a national imperative and must be a priority for 
4
Congress.
