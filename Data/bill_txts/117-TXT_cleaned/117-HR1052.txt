RESOLUTION 
Supporting the goals and ideals of a National Move Over 
Law Day. 
Whereas the House of Representatives wishes to recognize 
law enforcement, fire and rescue, emergency medical 
services, tow truck operators, and transportation workers 
as traffic incident management responders (as such term 
is defined by the Traffic Incident Management Handbook 
of the Federal Highway Administration); 
Whereas, due to the increasingly high rate of distracted driv-
ers on the roadway, many traffic incident management 
responders lose their lives while performing their duties 
each year; 
Whereas, nationally in 2021, 65 traffic incident management 
responders were killed due to roadside collisions;

Whereas every State has a ‘‘move over’’ law, which has cor-
related directly to a safer environment along our Nation’s 
roadsides for traffic incident management responders and 
stranded citizens; 
Whereas ‘‘move over’’ laws generally require motorists to 
move at least 1 lane over when there is an emergency or 
rescue activity taking place on the shoulder or side of the 
roadway, or, if unable to do so safely, to slow down and 
pass the scene with caution; 
Whereas a Government Accountability Office report (GAO– 
21–166) on Emergency Responder Safety noted that 
State officials cite raising public awareness as the most 
prevalent challenge to ‘‘move over’’ laws; and 
Whereas providing traffic incident management responders 
an enhanced opportunity to inform the motoring public 
about these laws is critical to the public safety: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the goals and ideals of a National

Move Over Law Day; 
3
(2) urges the national incident management or-
4
ganizations, as well as State and regional incident 
5
management organizations, to spread awareness and 
6
promote the existence of, and adherence to, State 
7
‘‘move over’’ laws; and 
8
(3) urges the national incident management or-
9
ganizations, and similar State and regional incident 
10
management organizations, to educate the public
