A BILL 
To authorize the National Science Foundation to make 
awards to institutions of higher education and non-profit 
organizations for research, development, and related ac-
tivities to advance innovative approaches to developing, 
improving, and expanding evidence-based microelec-
tronics education and workforce development activities 
and learning experiences at all levels of education, and 
for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Creating Helpful Ini-

3
tries Act of 2022’’ or the ‘‘CHIPPING IN Act of 2022’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
5
Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) While microelectronics are a primary driver 
7
of economic growth and scientific advancement, the 
8
United States has lost much of its capacity to design 
9
and manufacture, test, and package microelectronics 
10
and microelectronics systems domestically. 
11
(2) Current educational and vocational training 
12
opportunities are insufficient to meet the domestic 
13
microelectronics industry workforce needs. The def-
14
icit between open jobs and qualified workers is pro-
15
jected to grow as design and manufacturing activi-
16
ties increase. 
17
(3) Growth in microelectronics design and man-
18
ufacturing capabilities may be limited by a lack of 
19
qualified workers. 
20
(4) The United States education pathways for 
21
microelectronics faces significant challenges, from a 
22
lack of gender and racial diversity to an inability of 
23
universities and community colleges to attract and 
24
retain faculty and other instructors qualified to 
25
teach microelectronics. 
26

•HR 8251 IH
(5) Students often fail to get the hands-on 
1
training they need to succeed in microelectronics ca-
2
reers, especially at the community or technical col-
3
lege level. 
4
(6) Skilled technical jobs in the manufacturing 
5
industry and in the microelectronics design industry 
6
are well-suited for apprenticeship and other paid 
7
training models, however prospective participants 
8
must have adequate STEM training. 
9
(7) The microelectronics industry suffers from 
10
a lack of awareness and visibility as pre-college stu-
11
dents, students pursuing STEM degrees, technical 
12
workers, and doctorate-level researchers seek em-
13
ployment in other industries. 
14
(8) Lack of access to co-located design and fab-
15
rication facilities, including attendant software li-
16
censing issues is a deterrent for United States com-
17
petitiveness and workforce development. 
18
(9) In order to help drive forward advances in 
19
microelectronics and increase domestic microelec-
20
tronics design and manufacturing capability, the 
21
Federal Government must provide sufficient re-
22
sources and use its convening power to facilitate the 
23
growth of microelectronics talent in academia, the
