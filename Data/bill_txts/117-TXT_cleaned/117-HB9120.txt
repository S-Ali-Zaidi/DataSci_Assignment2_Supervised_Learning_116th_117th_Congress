•HR 9120 IH
(1) The Russian Federation seeks to diminish

the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) 
2
and recreate its sphere of influence in Europe using 
3
coercion, intimidation, and outright aggression. 
4
(2) Deterring the Russian Federation from 
5
such aggression is vital for transatlantic security. 
6
(3) The illegal occupation of Crimea by the 
7
Russian Federation and its continued engagement of 
8
destabilizing and subversive activities against inde-
9
pendent and free states is of increasing concern. 
10
(4) The Russian Federation also continues to 
11
disregard treaties, international laws and rights to 
12
freedom of navigation, territorial integrity, and sov-
13
ereign international borders. 
14
(5) The Russian Federation’s continued occupa-
15
tion of Georgian and Ukrainian territories and the 
16
sustained military buildup in the Russian Federa-
17
tion’s Western Military District and Kaliningrad has 
18
threatened continental peace and stability. 
19
(6) The Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia, and 
20
Lithuania are particularly vulnerable to an increas-
21
ingly aggressive and subversive Russian Federation.

5
rence across the region’’.

7
United States have repeatedly demonstrated their 
8
commitment to advancing mutual interests as well 
9
as those of the NATO alliance. 
10
(9) The Baltic countries also continue to par-
11
ticipate in United States-led exercises to further pro-
12
mote coordination, cooperation, and interoperability 
13
among allies and partner countries, and continue to 
14
demonstrate their reliability and commitment to pro-
15
vide for their own defense. 
16
(10) Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia each hosts 
17
a respected NATO Center of Excellence that pro-
18
vides expertise to educate and promote NATO allies 
19
and partners in areas of vital interest to the alliance. 
20
(11) United States support and commitment to 
21
allies across Europe has been a lynchpin for peace 
22
and security on the continent for over 70 years.
