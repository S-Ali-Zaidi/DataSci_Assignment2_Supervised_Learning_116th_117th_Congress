RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the 125th Anniversary of the Indiana Veterans’ 
Home. 
Whereas Indiana has a proud tradition of honoring its vet-
erans and those who serve our country; 
Whereas 3 out of 4 Hoosiers of eligible age served in the Civil 
War; 
Whereas 1 out of every 10 Union Army soldiers enlisted from 
Indiana, and only 1 State, Delaware, provided more sol-
diers in the Civil War based on per capita population 
than Indiana; 
Whereas the Soldiers and Sailors Monument is located in the 
center of Indianapolis and the State of Indiana, and 
when it was dedicated in 1902, the only monument taller 
in the United States was the Washington Monument;

Whereas, in 1886, at the annual encampment of the Depart-
ment of Indiana Grand Army of the Republic (‘‘G.A.R.’’) 
held in Indianapolis, Indiana, Department Commander 
David N. Foster urged the G.A.R. to establish a State 
soldiers’ home in Indiana to care for the disabled Union 
Veteran Soldiers; 
Whereas intensive lobbying by the G.A.R. resulted in the In-
diana General Assembly of 1888 resolving to found a 
home for veterans, and in 1890, work toward the home 
began; 
Whereas a committee was founded to find a suitable location 
for the home, with a member-at-large and 1 member 
from each congressional district, including James R. 
Carnahan (at large), W.H. Tucker, David N. Foster, C.J. 
Murphy, D.F. Spees, Andrew Fite, H.B. Martin, U.D. 
Cole, A.O. Marsh, C.M. Travis, W.S. Haggard, D.B. 
McConnell, Jacob J. Todd, and Jasper E. Lewis; 
Whereas, in the summer of 1892, the committee decided to 
formally recommend 187 wooded acres in Lafayette, Indi-
ana, as the location of the Indiana State Soldiers’ Home 
(also known as the ‘‘Indiana Veterans’ Home’’) (referred 
to in this preamble as the ‘‘Home’’); 
Whereas the City of Lafayette and the County of Tippecanoe 
agreed to donate 200 acres of ground and $5,633 for the 
Home; 
Whereas General Richard P. DeHart, a local veteran and 
business man, donated a 2,000-foot strip of riverfront 
property, which is now known as the Tecumseh Trails 
Park, to the Home;

Whereas the committee, having secured a location, prepared 
a bill to be presented to the Indiana General Assembly 
for the establishment and maintenance of the Home; 
Whereas, due to lack of time, the bill failed to pass the Indi-
ana Senate, but in 1895, the Indiana General Assembly 
unanimously passed a bill to create the Home and appro-
priated $75,000 for its buildings; 
Whereas, on February 23, 1895, Governor Claude Matthews 
signed the bill, and it became law; 
Whereas the Governor appointed 5 men as the first Board of 
Trustees of the Home to work without compensation 
other than their actual traveling expenses; 
Whereas 
the 
Indiana 
General 
Assembly 
appropriated 
$61,723.61 to be used in building an old men’s home, a 
chapel, and an addition to the dining room, constructing 
sewers, furnishing the different buildings, graveling 
streets, roads, and sidewalks, and purchasing a pump, a 
dynamo, and a fire apparatus; 
Whereas, by 1900, numerous buildings had been erected for 
the use of the residents of the Home, and the applica-
tions for residence at the Home were far greater than its 
facilities were capable of handling; 
Whereas, on October 31, 1900, there were 9 State buildings, 
39 county cottages, 5 cottages built by the G.A.R., 1 cot-
tage built by the Woman’s Relief Corps of Indiana 
(‘‘W.R.C.’’), 1 cottage each built by the John A. Logan 
and Marsh B. Taylor W.R.C. of Lafayette, and 1 cottage 
built by the John A. Logan Circle, Ladies of the Grand 
Army of the Republic of Lafayette;

Whereas, in addition to these buildings, the Home built a 
public restaurant, Commandant’s home, Surgeon’s cot-
tage, and combination carpenter and paint shop; 
Whereas, in addition to the sums donated for the buildings, 
the W.R.C. and Ladies of the G.A.R. throughout the 
State gave $1,326.25 to furnish rooms and cottages in 
the Home; 
Whereas, in his written history of Tippecanoe County from 
1909, General Richard P. DeHart wrote of the Home, 
‘‘If one ever doubted that America appreciates and cares 
for her defenders, a visit to this beauty spot of Indiana 
will convince them that not only in times of peril and war 
does she care for her brave soldiery, but that now after 
forty years have come and gone, she still seeks to show 
these old and infirm men that she wishes them all the 
peace and comfort possible to provide for them, at any 
cost.’’; 
Whereas peak census was reached in the 1910s when the 
Home housed over 1,400 residents and another 200 staff 
members; 
Whereas the Home operated as its own little town, complete 
with a hospital, electric light plant, bakery, fire depart-
ment, and an assembly hall with a seating capacity for 
600 people; 
Whereas census in the 1920s had declined to the average 
number of residents numbering in the 1,000s; 
Whereas this state of affairs continued, and, by 1950, it was 
apparent that the Home needed a major revamping; 
Whereas this revamping resulted in the destruction of almost 
all of the original buildings, and today only 5 structures 
remain from the earlier years of the Home, including the

Commandant’s home, the Administration Building, the 
Lawrie Library, the bus station, and the cemetery chapel; 
Whereas 9 acres of the Home’s land were listed in National 
Register of Historic Places in 1974, including 4 original 
buildings—the Commandant’s home, the library, the Ad-
ministration Building, and the post exchange; 
Whereas, in addition, a collection of approximately 165 oil 
portraits and charcoal drawings of Civil War generals 
and important political figures, painted by Captain Alex-
ander Lawrie, are housed in the library and add a major 
cultural dimension to the Home; 
Whereas, in 1974, the Home became a licensed healthcare fa-
cility; 
Whereas, on June 4, 1976, the Home’s name was officially 
changed from the Indiana State Soldiers’ Home to the 
Indiana Veterans’ Home, and the title of the chief admin-
istrator was changed from Commandant to Super-
intendent; 
Whereas, in 1976, the construction of Ernie Pyle Hall, Mac-
Arthur Hall, and Mitchell Hall began and continued until 
completion in 1982; 
Whereas, in 2009, the Commandant’s Row buildings were 
placed under the authority of the Indiana Department of 
Veterans Affairs and the Home; 
Whereas census has declined over the decades as Civil War 
veterans passed, but the Home has averaged 200 resi-
dents annually, ranging between 120 to 265 residents 
from the 1970s to the present; 
Whereas the Home is operated by the State of Indiana to 
care for honorably discharged Indiana veterans and their 
spouses and Gold Star parents;

Whereas there is no wartime service requirement in order to 
be eligible to apply for admission to the Home, and the 
Home accepts all periods of service; 
Whereas the Home is a full-service care facility, offering a 
complete array of on-site services for its residents; 
Whereas the Home currently boasts a small museum of his-
torical artifacts related to various wars, as well as arti-
facts from the Home’s history; 
Whereas the Home provides quality care for veterans, their 
spouses, and Gold Star parents; 
Whereas there are currently 3,000 graves in the Home’s cem-
etery, which serves as the final resting place for its resi-
dents and their spouses who chose internment there; and 
Whereas the Home has played a vital role in assisting Hoo-
sier Veterans and their families in their time of need: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-
1
resentatives that— 
2
(1) the Indiana Veterans’ Home has been, and 
3
continues to be, an example of Hoosiers’ dedication 
4
to their veterans, especially those who served in the

Civil War;

(2) the Indiana Veterans’ Home, along with the

6
(4) the Indiana Veterans’ Home should be rec-

Indiana and their families at this beautiful and his-
9
torically significant property in the State.
