The Congress finds the following:

•HR 3605 IH
(1) Environmental, social, and governance (in 
1
this Act referred to as ‘‘ESG’’) include the potential 
2
for economic benefits, such as local job creation and 
3
economic development, in addition to investment re-
4
turns, as provided by investments sometimes re-
5
ferred to as ‘‘Economically Targeted Investments’’ 
6
or ‘‘ETIs’’. 
7
(2) There is now incontrovertible evidence that 
8
ESG factors can have substantial effects on invest-
9
ment performance and are important to many inves-
10
tors and that investors have a significant interest in 
11
such findings. 
12
(3) Investor findings show a dramatic interest 
13
in investments that consider ESG factors. 
14
(4) Decades of policy interpretations from the 
15
Department of Labor and the Securities and Ex-
16
change Commission have created confusion as to the 
17
obligations of a fiduciary with regard to ESG 
18
intergration. 
19
(5) Recent policies of the Securities and Ex-
20
change Commission have had a chilling effect on 
21
ESG integration and active ownership with a view 
22
toward advancing a sustainable economy.
