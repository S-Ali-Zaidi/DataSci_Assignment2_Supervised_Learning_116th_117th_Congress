Congress finds the following:

•HR 9104 IH
(1) The Jewish people have long formed an in-
1
tegral part of the culture and history of Europe and 
2
of Poland. 
3
(2) Europeans Jews contribute to the rich di-
4
versity of society and culture across Europe. 
5
(3) For centuries, prior to World War II, Po-
6
land represented a center of Jewish life in Europe 
7
and was home to millions of Jews. 
8
(4) Prior to World War II, 350,000 Jews lived 
9
in Warsaw, representing about 30 percent of the 
10
city’s population. 
11
(5) Following the Nazi takeover of Poland, the 
12
Germans established the Warsaw ghetto in October 
13
1940, and unlawfully confined Jewish civilians to the 
14
ghetto in November 1940, with the population of the 
15
ghetto reaching a height of 400,000 Jews. 
16
(6) Life in the Warsaw ghetto was marked by 
17
widespread starvation, disease, physical violence, and 
18
deplorable conditions unsuitable for life, leading to 
19
the deaths of 83,000 Jews between 1940 and mid- 
20
1942. 
21
(7) In less than two months in 1942, German 
22
units deported about 265,000 Jews from Warsaw to 
23
the Treblinka death camp and killed an additional 
24
35,000 Jews inside the ghetto.

(8) In early 1943, German and SS units in-
1
tended to deport the remaining Jewish population of 
2
the ghetto to forced labor camps, but many Jews re-
3
sisted deportation. 
4
(9) The Warsaw Ghetto Uprising began on 
5
April 19, 1943, when SS and police forces appeared 
6
outside the walls of the Warsaw ghetto with the in-
7
tent of liquidating the ghetto and deporting its re-
8
maining inhabitants. 
9
(10) Aided in part by arms from the Polish un-
10
derground and relying on clandestinely organized 
11
Jewish self-defense groups, the ghetto heroically re-
12
sisted German forces, mounting an organized armed 
13
resistance against SS and police units and fighting 
14
against impossible odds. 
15
(11) Jews in the ghetto continued to fend off 
16
their German occupiers for almost one month, fight-
17
ing to the last. 
18
(12) After weeks of resistance, the Germans 
19
systematically destroyed the ghetto, burning build-
20
ings and razing city blocks in an attempt to erase 
21
the memory and existence of the Jewish people. 
22
(13) By May 16, 1943, German forces had sup-
23
pressed the uprising and deported the ghetto’s sur-

viving inhabitants to concentration camps and killing 
1
centers. 
2
(14) The heroes of the Warsaw ghetto who 
3
bravely defended themselves in the face of unimagi-
4
nable crimes set an example for other occupied cities 
5
and for other Jewish communities. 
6
(15) In total, over 3,000,000 Polish Jews were 
7
murdered by the Nazis during the Holocaust, with 
8
only about 380,000 Polish Jews still alive in Poland, 
9
the Soviet Union, or in concentration camps by the 
10
end of the war. 
11
(16) Genocide involves the erasure and elimi-
12
nation of the memory and culture of a people, and 
13
therefore the United States must work to preserve 
14
the historical record of Jewish people around the 
15
world, many of whom now live in the United States. 
16
(17) Current and future generations benefit 
17
from the preservation and memorialization of their 
18
history and culture. 
19
(18) Millions of Jewish people whose ancestors 
20
came from Poland now live in the United States, 
21
Israel, and around the world. 
22
(19) Preservation of the history and culture of 
23
Jewish people in Poland is essential to learning the 
24

•HR 9104 IH
lessons of history and ensuring the prosperity of the 
1
Jewish people for future generations. 
2
(20) Museums are an important contributor to 
3
the historical preservation of human memory, pro-
4
viding cultural, education and civic centers where 
5
people can learn about the life and record of individ-
6
uals or groups of people from the past. 
7
(21) Museums dedicated to the historical mem-
8
ory of Jewish people or the struggle for survival of 
9
the Jewish people during the Holocaust play a crit-
10
ical role in preserving the memory of Jewish people. 
11
(22) The construction of further museums, in-
12
cluding the Warsaw Ghetto Museum, would be a 
13
welcoming place for all visitors who want to better 
14
understand the fate of Jews incarcerated in the 
15
Warsaw ghetto. 
16
(23) The POLIN Museum of the History of the 
17
Polish Jews is a central location for Jewish people 
18
around the world to learn about the life, history, and 
19
culture of their ancestors. 
20
(24) The POLIN Museum is an important edu-
21
cational hub for all people to learn about the rich 
22
history of Jewish people who were targeted and he-
23
roically fought back against the Nazis in their at-
24
tempt to erase the memory of Jewish life in Europe.

(25) The POLIN Museum in Warsaw should be 
1
celebrated for the important role it plays in the pres-
2
ervation of the memory of Jewish life as it docu-
3
ments the long history of Jewish life in Poland and 
4
Europe both before and after the war, and sits on 
5
the site of the former Warsaw ghetto where so many 
6
heroic Jews fought against the erasure of the mem-
7
ory of the Jewish people.
