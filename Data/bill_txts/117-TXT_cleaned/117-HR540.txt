Whereas members of the Texas Legislature have taken an 
oath to ‘‘faithfully execute the duties of the office’’; 
Whereas, on June 25, 2021, Texas Governor Greg Abbott, 
acting within his powers, ordered a special session to ad-
dress important issues affecting the State of Texas, in-
cluding election integrity; 
Whereas instead of fulfilling their oath of office and rep-
resenting their constituents as the Texas Legislature re-
convened on July 12, over 50 Democratic members and 
paid staff of the legislature chartered private planes to 
flee the State for Washington, DC; 
Whereas the Democratic members of the legislature refuse to 
be fully transparent about their meetings in Washington 
and how they relate to their official responsibilities or the 
costs of their travel; 
Whereas the Democrat members are advocating circum-
venting State law and federalizing Texas elections 
through passage of H.R. 1; 
Whereas our Founders set up a federalist election system 
which allowed States to write and organize their own 
elections; 
Whereas this bill, also known as ‘‘For the Politicians Act’’, 
would use taxpayer dollars to fund political campaigns, 
weaken our election security, and take the ability to man-
age elections away from Texas and give it to Washington 
bureaucrats; 
Whereas there are reports of Democratic members of the leg-
islature soliciting donations to pay for their expenses in 
Washington; 
Whereas the Texas Legislature is considering legislation to 
address unique challenges to the State’s election process;

Whereas the United States Capitol Complex remains re-
stricted to public access; 
Whereas some Democratic members of the legislature have 
tested positive for COVID-19, presenting health risks for 
individuals with whom they come in contact; 
Whereas, on July 13, 2021, the Texas House of Representa-
tives passed a resolution to allow the Texas Department 
of Public Safety (DPS) to arrest and return to the Texas 
State Capitol any lawmaker who fled the State; and 
Whereas the Texas DPS is working to coordinate its efforts 
with other law enforcement jurisdictions: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That— 
1
(1) it is the sense of the House of Representa-
2
tives that the claims made by the members of the 
3
Texas Legislature who have fled to the Nation’s cap-
4
ital from Texas are unfounded at best and deceiving 
5
at worst, that their actions have further resulted in 
6
their abandonment of their responsibilities and duty 
7
to fulfill their oath of office; and 
8
(2) the House of Representatives urges the Ser-
9
geant at Arms of the House, the United States Cap-
10
itol Police, and Department of Justice to cooperate 
11
with the Texas Department of Public Safety in their 
12
efforts to return these members to Texas.
