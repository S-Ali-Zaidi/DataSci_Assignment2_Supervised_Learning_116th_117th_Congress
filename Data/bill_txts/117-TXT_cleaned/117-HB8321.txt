3

(2) Financial fraud attacks targeting members 
5

6
ents increased by 69 percent from 2020 to 2021. 
7
(3) In 2020, more than 56,000 military con-
8
sumers submitted fraud reports to the Federal 
9
Trade Commission indicating a collective fraud loss 
10
of approximately $102 million; in 2021, over 
11
110,000 military consumers submitted fraud reports 
12
to the Federal Trade Commission indicating a collec-
13
tive fraud loss of approximately $267 million, a 162 
14
percent increase in fraud loss over 2020. 
15
(4) Veterans alone reported a collective fraud 
16
loss of $177 million in 2021, with members of the

20
targeting members of the Armed Forces, veterans, 
21

22
nated interagency approach that examines current 
23
and emerging fraudulent schemes to safeguard the 
24
financial security of our military consumers.
