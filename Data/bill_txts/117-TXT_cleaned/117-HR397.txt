RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
Critical Race Theory serves as a prejudicial ideological 
tool, rather than an educational tool, and should not 
be taught in K–12 classrooms as a way to teach students 
to judge individuals based on sex, race, ethnicity, and 
national origin. 
Whereas Critical Race Theory seeks to portray the United 
States not as a united Nation of people, families, and

communities striving for a common purpose, but rather 
one of many victimized groups based on sex, race, eth-
nicity, and national origin; 
Whereas Critical Race Theory’s teachings stand in contrast 
to the overarching goal of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 
to prevent discrimination on the basis of race, color, or 
national origin in the United States; 
Whereas William Jacobson, a Cornell University professor, 
created criticalrace.org to highlight the over 200 univer-
sities across the Nation with Critical Race Theory pro-
gramming; 
Whereas while present on college and university campuses for 
decades, Critical Race Theory has increasingly infiltrated 
our Nation’s elementary and secondary school classrooms 
in recent years; 
Whereas Critical Race Theory serves to resegregate institu-
tions of education and balkanize students into groups by 
race and ethnicity; 
Whereas efforts to indoctrinate Critical Race Theory into 
American school children are designed to eventually 
transform America by stigmatizing its economic system 
and create a hatred of all its institutions; 
Whereas Critical Race Theory founder Derrick Bell has stat-
ed that ‘‘most critical race theorists are committed to a 
program of scholarly resistance, and most hope scholarly 
resistance will lay the groundwork for wide-scale resist-
ance.’’; 
Whereas Critical Race Theory serves to reinforce the soft big-
otry of low expectations by substituting systemic racism 
as the determining factor in academic achievement gaps 
rather than the ongoing failure of policymakers and the

education system to provide students of color necessary 
educational opportunities; 
Whereas Critical Race Theory has manifested itself in various 
damaging ways in American elementary and secondary 
schools; 
Whereas the 1619 Project, which puts slavery, not the ideal 
of equality, at the center of our Nation’s storyline and 
has been widely debunked by historians across the ideo-
logical spectrum, is nevertheless being taught in 4,500 
classrooms across the country; 
Whereas the California Department of Education (CDE) 
Foundation, in partnership with over 30 education orga-
nizations and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, de-
veloped ‘‘A Pathway to Equitable Math Instruction’’ tool-
kit that promotes the concept that White supremacy 
manifests itself through the focus on finding the right an-
swers, thereby discouraging teachers from requiring stu-
dents to show their work or consider ways there could be 
two answers to a problem; 
Whereas, in 2017, the Seattle Public School Board directed 
the ‘‘Ethnic Studies Task Force’’ to develop an ethnic 
studies curriculum, which defined ethnic studies as a way 
to counteract systems of oppression, such as patriarchy 
and capitalism; 
Whereas the Madison Metropolitan School District is requir-
ing staff to participate in mandatory 21 hours of profes-
sional development that claims practices such as teachers 
leading a classroom, keeping a class on schedule, and the 
term ‘‘student’’ are a part of White, Western thought 
and are racist;

Whereas students at a Las Vegas charter school were re-
quired to take a yearlong virtual ‘‘Sociology of Change’’ 
course where assignments required students to reveal 
their race, gender, sexual orientation, and disabilities and 
then determine if oppression or privilege were a part of 
those identities, allegedly without any accommodations if 
a student had a conscientious objection to the course; 
Whereas, in October 2020, the San Diego Unified School 
District board voted to change ‘‘discriminatory grading 
practices’’ and no longer requires students to turn in 
their homework on time in order to ‘‘be an anti-racist 
school district’’; 
Whereas while students should learn how to actively engage 
in civil society, Critical Race Theory often advocates for 
‘‘action civics’’, which in some school districts has re-
sulted in students being taught how to engage in disrup-
tive protests without as much concern for teaching the 
fundamentals of how government works and why; 
Whereas according to the Annenberg Public Policy Center at 
the University of Pennsylvania, just over half of all 
Americans cannot name all three branches of govern-
ment, and 76 percent of eighth grade students scored at 
or below proficient in civics on the most recent National 
Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) assessment; 
Whereas State legislators across the country have introduced 
bills to prevent schools from teaching that the United 
States is fundamentally racist or sexist, and that on ac-
count of an individual’s race or gender they may be re-
sponsible for actions committed in the past; 
Whereas, on January 19, 2021, the Department of Edu-
cation’s Office for Civil Rights posted a webinar to pro-

vide an overview on how racially exclusive practices are 
prohibited under title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 
but the Department of Education has since archived the 
webinar and labeled it as ‘‘not for reliance’’; and 
Whereas, on January 22, 2021, the Department of Edu-
cation’s Office for Civil Rights reportedly suspended a 
finding that an Illinois school district violated title VI of 
the Civil Rights Act when it segregated students and 
staff, directed teachers to treat students differently based 
on their race, and endorsed racially charged messages: 
Now, therefore, be it
