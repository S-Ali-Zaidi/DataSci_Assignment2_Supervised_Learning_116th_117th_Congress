1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Individuals with mild hearing loss are 3 
3
times more likely to experience a fall, and falls are 
4
the leading cause of fatal injury for Americans over 
5
65. 
6
(2) Seniors with hearing loss are more likely to 
7
develop cognitive problems and experience cognitive 
8
decline up to 40 percent faster than those without 
9
hearing loss. 
10
(3) Untreated hearing loss can lead to depres-
11
sion, anxiety, and social isolation. 
12
(4) Timely access to diagnosis and treatment 
13
for hearing and vestibular conditions can improve 
14
outcomes for beneficiaries and reduce overall cost of 
15
care. 
16
(5) Licensed audiologists in all 50 States and 
17
the District of Columbia are health care profes-
18
sionals that are trained in the diagnosis, treatment 
19
and rehabilitation of individuals with hearing, bal-
20
ance, and related disorders. 
21
(6) The Medicare program covers a range of 
22
hearing health services, including diagnostic and 
23
therapeutic services. However, Medicare will only re-
24
imburse audiologists for a narrow set of diagnostic 
25
services—even when Medicare-covered treatment

•HR 1587 IH
services are in the scope of practice of audiologists. 
1
Medicare also requires patients to receive a physi-
2
cian order before even receiving diagnostic services 
3
from audiologists in order for those services to be 
4
covered by the Medicare program. 
5
(7) The Department of Defense Medical Health 
6
System, the Veterans Health Administration, the Of-
7
fice of Personnel Management (through many of its 
8
Federal Employees Benefit plans), and many Med-
9
icaid and private health plans provide patients ‘‘di-
10
rect access’’ to audiologists and do not condition re-
11
imbursement on referral by a physician. 
12
(8) The National Academy of Sciences, Engi-
13
neering, and Medicine issued a report, entitled 
14
‘‘Hearing Health Care for Adults: Priorities for Im-
15
proving Access and Affordability,’’ which rec-
16
ommended that the Centers for Medicare and Med-
17
icaid Services ‘‘examine pathways for enhancing ac-
18
cess to assessment for and delivery of auditory reha-
19
bilitation services’’ through Medicare, ‘‘including re-
20
imbursement to audiologists for these services’’. 
21
(9) Administrative requirements for referral, 
22
plan of care, consultation with the attending physi-
23
cian or other health care practitioner, and oversight 
24
unnecessarily delay care and may increase costs.

(10) Medicare beneficiaries should have access 
1
to the same level of audiologic care as is available 
2
in the Veterans Administration, under the Federal 
3
Employees Health Benefits Program, and under pri-
4
vate insurance.
