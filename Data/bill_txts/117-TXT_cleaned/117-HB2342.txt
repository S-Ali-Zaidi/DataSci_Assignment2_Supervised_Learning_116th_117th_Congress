SEC. 2. PURPOSE. 
1
The purpose of this Act is to ensure the continued 
2
leadership of the United States in simulation technology 
3
and its applications by promoting the development and ex-
4
pansion of an American workforce skilled in the use of 
5
simulation technology in order to— 
6
(1) facilitate technology innovation and private 
7
sector commercialization; 
8
(2) meet economic and national security goals; 
9
(3) increase the competitiveness of small- and 
10
medium-sized United States businesses in the global 
11
market; 
12
(4) increase the competitiveness of large compa-
13
nies by increasing the efficiency of their small- and 
14
medium-sized suppliers; 
15
(5) expand the number of engineers and sci-
16
entists in the market and entering the market with 
17
expertise in simulation technology; 
18
(6) increase the number of United States small- 
19
and medium-sized businesses that use simulation 
20
technology as part of their standard operations; 
21
(7) promote the increased use of simulation 
22
technology, including the use of such technology by 
23
individuals identified in sections 33 and 34 of the 
24
Science and Engineering Equal Opportunities Act 
25
(42 U.S.C. 1885a, 1885b); and
