(1) nuclear deterrence is the bedrock of United 
1
States national security; 
2
(2) the ability for the United States to quickly 
3
and decisively respond to acts of aggression against 
4
the United States and the allies and partners of the 
5
United States, including nuclear attacks, deters ac-
6
tors from acting against the United States in the 
7
first place; 
8
(3) as currently structured, responsibility and 
9
authority for the release of nuclear weapons resides 
10
solely with the President; 
11
(4) any Presidential order for a nuclear strike 
12
must be verified by a senior official of the Depart-
13
ment of Defense or military officer to ensure that a 
14
lawful order was in fact issued by the President; 
15
(5) neither a senior official of the Department 
16
nor a military officer in the chain of command has 
17
veto power and, therefore, must comply with a law-
18
ful order or resign; 
19
(6) however, entrusting an individual with the 
20
authority to order the use of nuclear weapons raises 
21
the possibility, however small, of their accidental or 
22
inappropriate use that risks catastrophic loss of life 
23
and potential escalation into nuclear war; and
