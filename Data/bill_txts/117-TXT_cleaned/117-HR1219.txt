RESOLUTION 
Honoring the life and legacy of Father Stan, a prominent 
human rights activist who died while in custody of the 
Indian state on July 5, 2021, and encouraging India 
to pursue an independent investigation into his arrest, 
incarceration, and death. 
Whereas Father Stanislaus Lourduswamy, known as Father 
Stan, was born on April 26, 1937, in a village called 
Viragalur in the Tiruchirappalli District in the southern 
Indian state of Tamil Nadu, and, inspired by the work 
of Jesuit priests from an early age, studied theology 
starting in 1957; 
Whereas Father Stan spent his Jesuit regency in 1965 to 
1967 at St. Xavier’s High School Lupungutu, Chaibasa, 
in west Singhbhum, now in the central Indian state of

Jharkhand, and there came to love and appreciate the 
culture and values of India’s Adivasi (Hindi: ‘‘Original 
Inhabitants’’) community, as well as understood the prob-
lems they faced and exploitation they endured; 
Whereas, in 1971, Father Stan completed his master’s degree 
in sociology in the Philippines, where he met and was in-
fluenced by Brazilian Catholic Archbishop He´lder 
Caˆmara’s work with the poor, and was subsequently put 
in charge of the Catholic Relief Services charity in the 
Jesuit Jamshedpur Province, now in the Indian state of 
Jharkhand; 
Whereas Father Stan served as the director of the Indian So-
cial Institute, India’s leading Jesuit institution, in the 
southern Indian city of Bengaluru, from 1975 to 1990, 
where he trained young people from marginalized com-
munities across the Indian subcontinent alongside educa-
tionist Duarte Baretto; 
Whereas, through ideas of social justice and liberation the-
ology, Father Stan and the Indian Social Institute 
trained a generation of young leaders among communities 
including Dalits, indigenous communities (Adivasis), fish-
ing communities, agrarian communities, and labor move-
ments; 
Whereas, after finishing his work with the Indian Social In-
stitute in 1991, Father Stan moved to Chaibasa, in 
Jharkhand, where he worked for the Jharkhand 
Organisation for Human Rights, and worked tirelessly 
with the Adivasi people to protect their lands and homes 
from unfair expropriation by the state and mining cor-
porations;

Whereas, in 2006, with the support of the Jesuit society and 
intellectuals and activists such as Xavier Dias and 
Ramdayal Munda, Father Stan set up Bagaicha, a re-
search, documentation, and Adivasi training center near 
the city of Ranchi; 
Whereas Father Stan played a key role in one of the most 
significant Adivasi movements in contemporary India, the 
Pathalgadi movement, which used Adivasi traditions of 
stone carving (for instance, for gravestones) to spread in-
formation among Adivasi communities regarding rights 
guaranteed to them under the Indian Constitution; 
Whereas, during these decades in Jharkhand, Father Stan 
advocated for and raised awareness regarding the imple-
mentation of provisions of the Indian Constitution like 
the Panchayat (Extension to Scheduled Areas) or the 
PESA Act, which instituted self-governance for people 
dwelling in Adivasi lands; 
Whereas Father Stan also worked on ensuring the implemen-
tation of the Forest Rights Act of 2006, which recognized 
the rights of forest-dwelling communities to forest re-
sources; 
Whereas Father Stan also worked on ensuring the implemen-
tation of the Land Acquisition Act of 2013, which guar-
anteed the right to fair compensation, transparency in 
acquisition, and required the assent of the community via 
its self-governance group called the gram sabha; 
Whereas, on noticing widespread arrests of Adivasi youth for 
peaceful protests against land acquisition starting in 
2014 to 2015, in 2017 Father Stan formed the Per-
secuted Prisoners Solidarity Committee, to expose the il-
legal imprisonment of Adivasi activists, and filed a case

against the state of Jharkhand on behalf of at least 
3,000 Adivasi youths languishing in jail; 
Whereas, over the course of his long career fighting for the 
underprivileged, Father Stan authored over 70 books and 
booklets regarding the socioeconomic and cultural cir-
cumstances of the Adivasis in Jharkhand, their rights to 
development, and the violence perpetrated against them 
by agents of the Indian state; 
Whereas Father Stan published a 2015 Bagaicha report on 
102 Adivasi, Dalit, and ‘‘backward caste’’ youths illegally 
imprisoned titled ‘‘Deprived Rights Over Natural Re-
sources, Impoverished Adivasis Get Prison: A Study of 
Undertrials in Jharkhand’’; 
Whereas, in 2017, the state of Jharkhand charged Father 
Stan with ‘‘sedition’’ for a Facebook post written in sup-
port of the Pathalgadi movement; 
Whereas Father Stan was subsequently released, following 
the change in government in Jharkhand in 2019; 
Whereas, in August 2018 and June 2019, Pune police con-
ducted raids on Father Stan’s one-room home in 
Bagaicha in a case regarding clashes near Bhima 
Koregaon in the western Indian state of Maharashtra, 
and subjected Father Stan to hours of intense interroga-
tion; 
Whereas, as an octogenarian and a person suffering from 
Parkinson’s disease, and in the midst of a global pan-
demic, Father Stan declined to travel to Mumbai from 
Ranchi for further interrogation and on October 9, 2020, 
India’s National Investigation Agency placed Father Stan 
under arrest;

•HRES 1219 IH 
Whereas Father Stan was incarcerated in Taloja prison from 
October 9, 2020 until May 28, 2021, which provoked a 
gradual deterioration in his health; 
Whereas, after being ill-treated in prison to the extent of 
being denied a sipper and a straw to sip water from, and 
in spite of repeated attempts to secure bail by Father 
Stan’s defense team, bail was consistently denied to him, 
even after he contracted COVID–19; 
Whereas the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Human 
Rights Defenders Mary Lawlor, along with the Special 
Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of 
the highest attainable standard of physical and mental 
health and the Special Rapporteur on minority issues 
stated in a letter to the Government of India that the 
digital evidence compiled by the forensic reports rendered 
‘‘the ongoing detention of the 15 accused [in the Bhima 
Koregaon case, including Father Stan] as arbitrary and 
unlawful’’; 
Whereas forensic analysts revealed that unidentified hackers 
fabricated evidence on the computers of at least 2 activ-
ists arrested in Pune, India, in 2018, both of whom have 
languished in jail and, along with 13 others, face ter-
rorism charges; 
Whereas researchers at security firm SentinelOne and non-
profits Citizen Lab and Amnesty International have since 
linked that evidence fabrication to a broader hacking op-
eration that targeted hundreds of Indian activists; 
Whereas SentinelOne’s researchers revealed ties between the 
hackers and the Indian police agency in the city of Pune 
that arrested multiple activists based on the fabricated 
evidence, including Farther Stan;
