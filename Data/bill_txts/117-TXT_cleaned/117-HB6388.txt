(a) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds the following:

•HR 6388 IH
(1) According to the Department of Justice, 
1
human trafficking is ‘‘a crime that involves exploit-
2
ing a person for labor, services, or commercial sex’’, 
3
a global illicit trade that is estimated by Global Fi-
4
nancial Integrity to be valued at more than $150.2 
5
billion each year. 
6
(2) Polaris, the non-governmental organization 
7
which runs the United States National Human Traf-
8
ficking Hotline, has found that while human traf-
9
ficking is a nationwide problem, the majority of do-
10
mestic human trafficking victims are ‘‘people who 
11
have historically faced discrimination and its polit-
12
ical, social and economic consequences: people of 
13
color, indigenous communities, immigrants and peo-
14
ple who identify as LGBTQ+’’. 
15
(3) For this reason, it is important that law en-
16
forcement representing native communities and ter-
17
ritories are part of the national dialogue about coun-
18
tering human trafficking. 
19
(4) The High Intensity Financial Crime Areas 
20
program, which is intended to concentrate law en-
21
forcement efforts at the Federal, State, and local 
22
level to combat money laundering in designated 
23
high-intensity money laundering zones, considers 
24

•HR 6388 IH
human trafficking among other financial crime 
1
issues and actors. 
2
(5) In each High Intensity Financial Crime 
3
Area, a money-laundering action team, comprised of 
4
relevant Federal, State, and local enforcement au-
5
thorities, prosecutors, and financial regulators, 
6
works together to coordinate Federal, State, and 
7
local anti-money laundering effort. 
8
(6) The High Intensity Financial Crime Area 
9
program does not currently mandate the inclusion of 
10
law enforcement and other agencies from Tribes and 
11
territories. 
12
(7) Further, the National Strategy for Com-
13
bating Terrorist and Other Illicit Financing, a valu-
14
able report which is scheduled to sunset in January 
15
2022, does not currently mandate the inclusion of 
16
law enforcement and other agencies from Tribes and 
17
Territories.
