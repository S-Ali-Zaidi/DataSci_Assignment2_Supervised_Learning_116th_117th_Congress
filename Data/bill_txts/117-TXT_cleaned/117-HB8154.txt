A BILL 
To prohibit use of facial recognition technology on any image 
acquired by body-worn cameras of law enforcement offi-
cers, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Facial Recognition 
4
Ban on Body Cameras Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) Facial recognition and other remote biomet-

cant threats to the civil rights and civil liberties of 
1
residents and visitors. 
2
(2) The use of facial recognition and other re-
3
mote biometric surveillance is the functional equiva-
4
lent of requiring every person to show a personal 
5
photo identification card at all times in violation of 
6
recognized constitutional rights. This technology also 
7
allows people to be tracked without consent. 
8
(3) It would also generate massive databases 
9
about law-abiding Americans, and may chill the ex-
10
ercise of free speech in public places. 
11
(4) Facial recognition and other remote biomet-
12
ric surveillance technology has been repeatedly dem-
13
onstrated to misidentify women, young people, peo-
14
ple with disabilities, transgender people, and people 
15
of color and to create an elevated risk of harmful 
16
‘‘false positive’’ identifications. 
17
(5) Facial and other remote biometric surveil-
18
lance would corrupt the core purpose of officer-worn 
19
body-worn cameras by transforming those devices 
20
from transparency and accountability tools into rov-
21
ing surveillance systems. 
22
(6) The use of facial recognition and other re-
23
mote biometric surveillance would disproportionately

impact the civil rights and civil liberties of persons 
1
who live in highly policed communities. 
2
(7) Its use would also diminish effective polic-
3
ing and public safety by discouraging people in these 
4
communities, including victims of crime, undocu-
5
mented persons, people with unpaid fines and fees, 
6
and those with prior criminal history from seeking 
7
police assistance or from assisting the police.
