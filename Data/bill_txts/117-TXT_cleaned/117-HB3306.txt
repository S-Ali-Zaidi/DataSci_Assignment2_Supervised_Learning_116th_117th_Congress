This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Uyghur Stop Oppres-

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) Eyewitness accounts provide credible docu-
6
mentation of widespread forced sterilization and sex-
7
ual violence against Uyghur and Kazakh women in 
8
the People’s Republic of China, including investiga-
9
tions and independent interviews by global media 
10
outlets. 
11
(2) Women who survived internment camps re-
12
port that they were forced to undergo multiple injec-
13
tions of unknown medicines that caused temporary 
14
or permanent loss of menstrual cycles. 
15
(3) Chinese 
Government 
documents 
dem-
16
onstrate rapid declines in population in two predomi-
17
nately Uyghur prefectures of the Xinjiang Uyghur 
18
Autonomous Region between 2015 and 2018, and an 
19
unprecedented near-zero birth rate target for 2020 
20
in one district. Government documents mandate that 
21
birth 
control 
violations 
are 
punishable 
by 
22
extrajudicial internment in ‘‘training’’ camps. 
23
(4) Chinese Government documents from 2019 
24
reveal plans for a campaign of mass female steriliza-
25
tion in rural Uyghur populated regions of the

Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, to be contin-
1
ued in 2020 with increased funding. Publicly avail-
2
able budgets indicate that this project had sufficient 
3
funding to perform hundreds of thousands of tubal 
4
ligation sterilization procedures in 2019 and 2020. 
5
(5) In 2019, the Government of the Xinjiang 
6
Uyghur Autonomous Region planned to subject at 
7
least 80 percent of women of childbearing age in the 
8
four southern, rural, minority prefectures to intru-
9
sive birth-prevention surgeries. 
10
(6) A leaked report written by Nankai Univer-
11
sity researchers for the Chinese Government con-
12
firms the intent of intention of state-organized 
13
forced labor transfers as having the ultimate pur-
14
pose of assimilating Uyghurs, ‘‘breaking up’’ their 
15
society, and altering demographic trends. 
16
(7) The policy of state-sponsored forced popu-
17
lation-transfer program, which separates married 
18
couples and forcibly places unmarried individuals 
19
into controlled environments where they cannot 
20
marry or form a family, is a violation of the funda-
21
mental right ‘‘to marry and to found a family,’’ as 
22
codified by Article 16 of the Universal Declaration 
23
of Human Rights (1948).

(8) Under the ‘‘becoming family’’ homestay pro-
1
gram initiated by the government of the People’s 
2
Republic of China in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autono-
3
mous Region, government workers and other Com-
4
munist Party members are assigned to live with eth-
5
nic minority families in their homes to conduct sur-
6
veillance and compile information on family mem-
7
bers, in arrangements which leave these families vul-
8
nerable to sexual violence and other types of abuse.

(9) On January 7, 2021, an official social 
10
media account for the Government of China said 
11
that a ‘‘Study shows that in the process of eradi-
12
cating extremism, the minds of Uygur women in 
13
Xinjiang were emancipated and gender equality and 
14
reproductive health were promoted, making them no 
15
longer baby-making machines [and] . . . . They are 
16
more confident and independent.’’. 
17
(10) Uyghur and Kazakh women who have 
18
given testimony to reporters about sexual violence 
19
and forced sterilizations in mass internment camps 
20
have been intimidated and their families threatened 
21

24
1948, which China has signed and ratified, states 
25

•HR 3306 IH
that ‘‘genocide means any of the following acts com-
1
mitted with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a 
2
national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such: 
3
‘‘(A) Killing members of the group;

‘‘(B) Causing serious bodily or mental 
5

‘‘(E) Forcibly transferring children of the

(12) On January 19, 2021, the Secretary of 
14
State released a determination about atrocities in 
15
the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region that stat-
16
ed that the ‘‘ongoing’’ crimes against humanity 
17
against the predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and 
18
other members of ethnic and religious minority 
19
groups include forced sterilization, and called upon 
20
the PRC ‘‘immediately to release all arbitrarily de-
21
tained persons and abolish its system of internment, 
22
detention camps, house arrest and forced labor; 
23
cease coercive population control measures, including

2

3
(13) That same determination concluded that, 
4
after careful examination of the facts, the Govern-
5
ment of China was committing ‘‘genocide’’ against 
6
Uyghur, Kazakh, and other ethnic minority groups 
7
in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. 
8
(14) Secretary of State Tony Blinken affirmed 
9
that the United States Government recognizes the 
10
atrocities faced by Uyghurs and other ethnic and re-
11
ligious minorities in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autono-
12
mous Region as ongoing genocide and crimes 
13
against humanity and said the United States will

hold the Government of China responsible for the
