RESOLUTION 
Supporting the goals and ideals of National Honor Our 
LGBT Elders Day. 
Whereas the National Resource Center of LGBT Aging re-
ports that there are 3,000,000 LGBT American adults 
over 50 years of age, and that number is expected to 
grow to around 7,000,000 by 2030; 
Whereas LGBT older adults face unique challenges as they 
age and are 2 times more likely to be single and live 
alone, and 4 times less likely to have children;

Whereas the Movement Advancement Project and Sage re-
port that LGBT older adults are more likely to face pov-
erty and homelessness, and to have poor physical and 
mental health; 
Whereas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, homophobia, transphobia, and biphobia con-
tribute to disparities in physical and mental health indi-
cators such as depression, substance use, cancer, and ex-
periences of abuse and violence; 
Whereas HIV disproportionately impacts the LGBT commu-
nity, and LGBT older people are no exception; 
Whereas 30 years ago the idea that someone with HIV would 
live decades was unimaginable, and now people with HIV 
are living well into their golden years, with 17 percent of 
all new HIV diagnoses in the United States in 2018 
being in people aged 50 and older; 
Whereas, despite all of these challenges, LGBT older people 
are living vibrant, full lives throughout every part of the 
country and around the world; 
Whereas LGBT older people were the pioneers who stood up 
and pushed back at the Stonewall uprising, and the care-
givers who stood by friends and loved ones through the 
height of the AIDS epidemic; 
Whereas LGBT older people are models of resilience, cele-
brating their identities while persevering through adver-
sity and helping to bring about incredible change for all 
LGBT people over just a few short decades; and 
Whereas May 16, 2021, would be an appropriate day for the 
celebration of National Honor Our LGBT Elders Day: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
