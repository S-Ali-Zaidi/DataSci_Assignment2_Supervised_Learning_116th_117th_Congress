RESOLUTION 
Recognizing a Space Coast Symbol of Kindness and urging 
acts of kindness throughout our Nation. 
Whereas we are kind when we act in the best interests of an-
other without expecting anything in return; 
Whereas our national character is to lift one another up by 
being kind; 
Whereas the United States has been a beacon of kindness to 
the rest of the world; 
Whereas kindness for each other brings unity and makes our 
Nation stronger than any one of us to meet our chal-
lenges; 
Whereas we need the healing and compassion that kindness 
can bring us in these times; 
Whereas children are often the best teachers of kindness;
