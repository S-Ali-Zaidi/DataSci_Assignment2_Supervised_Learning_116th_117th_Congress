7
ings:

•HR 7650 IH
(1) Even as the number of journalists killed in 
1
war zones has reached a historic low, the number of 
2
journalists killed or targeted in countries at peace 
3
continues to remain at historically high levels. In 
4
2020, more than 2⁄3 of all media fatalities took place 
5
in countries at peace. 
6
(2) Even as the COVID–19 pandemic reduced 
7
the number of journalists reporting from the field, 
8
Reporters Without Borders (RSF) reported that 50 
9
journalists were killed in 2020. Additionally, as of 
10
December 2020, 387 journalists remained impris-
11
oned worldwide, continuing the historically high 
12
trend seen in previous years, and 57 journalists were 
13
held hostage. 
14
(3) As the frontier between countries at war 
15
and countries at peace continues to disappear, more 
16
must be done to protect journalists and activists de-
17
fending human rights and spreading awareness of 
18
abuse and corruption. 
19
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
20
gress that— 
21
(1) a free and vibrant press is the fulcrum of 
22
democracy; 
23
00:52 May 04, 2022
H7650

•HR 7650 IH
(2) the protection and advancement of the free-
1
dom of expression is a foundational value of the 
2
United States; 
3
(3) the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
4
which the General Assembly of the United Nations 
5
adopted in 1948 with the United States voting in 
6
favor, defines freedom of expression, which includes 
7
a free press, as a fundamental human right; 
8
(4) the International Covenant on Civil and Po-
9
litical Rights, which the United States ratified in 
10
1992, specifies that everyone shall have the ‘‘free-
11
dom to seek, receive and impart information and 
12
ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either oral-
13
ly, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or 
14
through any other media of his choice’’; and 
15
(5) it is in the national security interest of the 
16
United States to promote the spread of democratic 
17
values and institutions worldwide.
