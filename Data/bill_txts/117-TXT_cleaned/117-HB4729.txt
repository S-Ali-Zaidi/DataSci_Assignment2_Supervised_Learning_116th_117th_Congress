to this act in accordance with the priorities set-

the following:

‘‘(i) In 1986, Congress designated the

Mississippi River System as both a nation-

system—the only inland river system to re-
20

‘‘(iii) The Mississippi River’s fresh-
3
water economy generates nearly $500 bil-
4
lion in annual revenue directly employing 
5
over 1.5 million people throughout the cor-
6
ridor providing drinking water supply to 
7
more than 20 million people in 50 cities. 
8
‘‘(iv) One in twelve people on Earth 
9
ingest commodities grown within the Mis-
10
sissippi River Basin. 
11
‘‘(v) The cities along the Mississippi 
12
River have a combined gross municipal 
13
product of nearly half a trillion U.S. dol-
14
lars generated from major economic sec-
15
tors including manufacturing, tourism, ag-
16
riculture, energy production, commercial 
17
navigation, mineral extraction, commercial 
18
harvest of natural resources, biotechnology, 
19
and telecommunication services.

‘‘(vi) The Mississippi River has the 
21
largest global trade footprint of any inland 
22
waterway in the western hemisphere giving 
23
it a significant stake in maintaining access

to global commodity markets for the

‘‘(vii) Waterways and ports in the 
3
Mississippi River ten-State corridor move 
4
$164.6 billion in agricultural products to 
5
U.S. and foreign markets. 55 to 70 percent 
6
of all U.S. exported corn, soy, and wheat 
7
as well as 60 percent of America’s corn 
8
and soybean exports (40 percent of the na-
9
tion’s total agricultural output) move on

‘‘(viii) The Corridor has sustained 
12
over $50 billion in natural disaster impacts 
13
within the Mississippi River Valley since 
14
2011 ($200 billion since 2005). On aver-

Rural cities are more likely to be disadvan-
