tual reality, mixed reality, and other technologies not yet 
invented, that enable the integration of digital content 
and the physical environment in a manner that supports 
user engagement; 
Whereas XR is a critical part of the emerging technology eco-
system that includes artificial intelligence, machine learn-
ing, robotics, quantum computing, and advanced commu-
nications; 
Whereas the House of Representatives and the Senate have 
passed legislation designating immersive technology as a

•HRES 1399 IH 
‘‘key technology focus area’’ for United States research 
and development prioritization; 
Whereas XR is expected to be the next major computing plat-
form, succeeding the laptop and smartphone and forming 
the foundation for the next iteration of the internet; 
Whereas XR will impact all sectors of society, creating new 
employment opportunities, a new economy, and new ways 
of communicating, learning, and engaging with the world; 
Whereas an estimated 23,000,000 jobs globally will use XR 
technology by 2030; 
Whereas the market for immersive technologies is projected 
to reach over $450,000,000,000 by 2030; 
Whereas XR is positively impacting the delivery of essential 
human services such as— 
(1) health care and medicine, where it is— 
(A) helping surgeons train and increase their 
skill level for complex surgeries; 
(B) used to assist stroke survivors with motor 
recovery; 
(C) used for cognitive behavioral therapy, sup-
porting veterans recovering from post-traumatic 
stress disorder (PTSD) and helping patients with 
mental illness address their anxiety disorders; 
(D) used to treat dementia and cognitive de-
cline, allowing elderly patients to recall old memories 
that would be otherwise unattainable due to illness 
or inaccessibility; and 
(E) being explored as an alternative to pharma-
ceuticals for pain management; and 
(2) public safety, where it is—

•HRES 1399 IH 
(A) providing safe, effective, risk-free training 
environments for firefighters and allowing fire-
fighters to see through smoke to identify people and 
objects in a fire emergency; 
(B) preparing emergency medical personnel to 
interact with a wide range of patients and environ-
ments; 
(C) supporting real-time coordination among 
first responders during natural disasters; and 
(D) helping police officers hone the skills need-
ed to deescalate tense situations; 
Whereas XR is preparing Americans for the future of work 
by facilitating workforce training and development, where 
it— 
(1) has the potential to effectively and efficiently 
train new workers without the need for costly physical re-
sources and facilities; 
(2) could expand opportunities for remote collabora-
tion across thousands of miles and provide real-time re-
mote assist which allows experts to guide workers 
through complicated tasks; 
(3) facilitates the upskilling of the current workforce 
to support worker retention; 
(4) increases safety in hazardous work environments 
by allowing businesses to virtually train employees on 
complex or dangerous tasks; 
(5) provides knowledge capture to ensure that exper-
tise and know-how is not lost if an experienced employee 
leaves; 
(6) provides text-to-speech capability for visually im-
paired employees; and

(7) has the potential to provide captions or subtitles 
for live audio for individuals that are deaf or hard of 
hearing; 
Whereas XR is improving efficiency in manufacturing, con-
struction, logistics, and agriculture, where it is— 
(1) used to improve speed and accuracy in engineer-
ing and product design; 
(2) used to create interactive 3D virtual models that 
save manufacturers time and money associated with de-
veloping countless physical prototypes; 
(3) streamlining complex assembly on the factory 
floor by allowing engineers to see renderings of cables, 
bolts, parts, and instructions for how to assemble a com-
ponent; 
(4) used to remotely monitor the condition of infra-
structure and assist with predictive maintenance; 
(5) facilitating cost-savings in urban planning by 
providing the opportunity to identify and remove poten-
tial design flaws before and during the construction 
phase; and 
(6) facilitating new advancements in smart farming, 
giving farmers real-time visualization of crops and pro-
viding assessments of land quality; 
Whereas XR is used in the classroom to improve educational 
outcomes and provide career training, where it— 
(1) provides multisensory learning experiences not 
available in physical classrooms; 
(2) promotes cognitive, social, and emotional devel-
opment for diverse learners; 
(3) provides immersive career exploration experi-
ences for students;

(4) prepares students for the growing demand for 
technology expertise and immersive media development 
skills in the workforce; and 
(5) inspires students’ creativity and confidence to try 
new things; 
Whereas XR brings people together, fosters a sense of com-
munity, and helps build empathy, where it— 
(1) has the potential to facilitate real-time trans-
lation, giving people easier, more natural ways to over-
come language barriers;

workers, friends, and families by providing shared, syn-
chronous spaces for community and collaboration; and 
Whereas XR plays an essential role in supporting United 
States national security objectives, where it is— 
(1) used by the United States military for training 
programs; and 
(2) used for emergency preparedness and disaster 
response and management: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
