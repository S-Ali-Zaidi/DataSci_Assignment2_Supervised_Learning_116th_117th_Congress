dous amount of work left to be done to further increase 
those opportunities.

Whereas in 2002, Congress passed a joint resolution estab-
lishing that title IX may be cited as the ‘‘Patsy 
Takemoto Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act’’; 
Whereas title IX prohibits any institution that receives Fed-
eral education funding from discriminating against stu-
dents or employees on the basis of sex; 
Whereas sex discrimination includes discrimination based 
on— 
(1) pregnancy, childbirth, termination of pregnancy, 
and medical conditions related to pregnancy, childbirth, 
and termination of pregnancy; 
(2) actual or perceived sexual orientation, gender 
identity, and sex characteristics; 
(3) sex stereotypes; and 
(4) sex-based harassment, including sexual harass-
ment and assault, dating violence, domestic violence, and 
sex-based stalking; 
Whereas since 1972, the United States has made great 
progress in providing educational opportunities to women 
and girls and, in 2022, women earned the majority of 
doctoral, master’s, and associate degrees; 
Whereas in the 2020–2021 academic year, women earned ap-
proximately 60 percent of the bachelor’s degrees awarded 
by institutions of higher education in the United States; 
Whereas since 1972, the participation of women and girls in 
sports has increased by 1,057 percent in high school and 
greater than 600 percent in college, providing women and 
girls with the opportunity—

(2) to earn athletic scholarships to help finance a 
college degree; and

(3) to become successful professional athletes; 
Whereas despite the progress that has been made in higher 
education and athletics, women, girls, pregnant or par-
enting students, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, 
queer, intersex, and gender non-conforming (LGBTQI+) 
individuals in the United States are still frequently de-
nied equal educational opportunities; 
Whereas pregnant and parenting students are more likely to 
drop out of high school compared to other students, only 
50 percent of teenage mothers earn a high school diploma 
by the age of 22, 38 percent of Black teen mothers and 
36 percent of Latina teen mothers never obtain a di-
ploma or GED, and fewer than 2 percent of all teen 
mothers graduate college by age 30, leading to decreased 
opportunities for continuing education and employment; 
Whereas a 2018 report from the Government Accountability 
Office found that, compared to White girls, Black girls 
were 5 times more likely and American Indian and Alas-
kan Native girls and multiracial girls were nearly 2 and 
a half times more likely to receive an out-of-school-sus-
pension; 
Whereas the number of baccalaureate degrees in science, 
technology, engineering, and math earned by women has 
decreased over the past decade and, as of the 2019–2020 
academic year, women earn only— 
(1) 39.1 percent of physical science degrees; 
(2) 18.7 percent of computing degrees; 
(3) 20.9 percent of engineering degrees; and 
(4) 42.4 percent of mathematics degrees; 
Whereas despite representing 60 percent of all students en-
rolled in colleges and universities in the United States,

women hold almost 2/3 of all outstanding student debt 
($929,000,000,000 of the total $1,762,000,000,000), and 
the average amount of student debt owed by a woman 
following the completion of a baccalaureate degree is 
$2,700 more than the average amount of student debt 
owed by a man; 
Whereas men still hold the vast majority of leadership posi-
tions, while women make up approximately— 
(1) 6.4 percent of the chief executive officers of com-
panies included in the S&P 500; 
(2) 18 percent of Governors; 
(3) 31 percent of executive officers elected in state-
wide elections; and 
(4) 30 percent of college and university presidents; 
Whereas when data is disaggregated, women of color have 
lower rates of— 
(1) leadership positions; and 
(2) science, technology, engineering, and math de-
grees; 
Whereas despite constituting a majority in their field or in-
dustry, women remain underrepresented in leadership po-
sitions and, for example, constitute— 
(1) 50 percent of law school graduates over the past 
20 years, but only 31 percent of non-equity partners and 
21 percent of equity partners at major law firms; 
(2) 76 percent of the health care workforce, but only 
27 percent of the chief executive officers of hospitals; and 
(3) 44 percent of all National Collegiate Athletic As-
sociation Division I, Division II, and Division III student 
athletes, but only 14 percent of the athletic directors in 
Division I sports;

Whereas since the enactment of title IX in 1972, inequities

opportunities than men for the 2020–2021 school year; 
Whereas women continue to experience sexual harassment 
and assault— 
(1) in elementary and secondary schools; 
(2) at colleges and universities; and 
(3) in the workplace; 
Whereas among individuals in elementary or secondary 
school, 1 in 4 girls will experience some form of sexual 
abuse before turning 18 years old, with more than 50 
percent of girls in grades 7 through 12 experiencing sex-
ual harassment; 
Whereas multiple studies have confirmed that— 
(1) 1 in 5 women and 1 in 4 transgender or gender 
non-conforming students are sexually assaulted on college 
campuses; and 
(2) approximately 20 percent of girls have been the 
victims of sexual assault or attempted sexual assault 
while in high school; 
Whereas experiencing sexual harassment and discrimination 
can— 
(1) lead to higher rates of depression, anxiety, and 
suicidal ideation; and 
(2) have severe educational and financial con-
sequences and negatively impact academic achievement, 
including dropping out of school; and 
Whereas students face pervasive discrimination and harass-
ment on the basis of sexual orientation and gender iden-
tity in school, on college campuses, and in the workplace,
