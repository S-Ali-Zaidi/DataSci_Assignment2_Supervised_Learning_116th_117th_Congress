RESOLUTION 
Calling for the Secretary of State to direct that the United 
States Permanent Representative to the United Nations 
and other International Organizations in Geneva and 
the United States Permanent Representative to the 
Human Rights Council sponsor the strongest possible 
resolution by September 28, 2022, to ensure that the 
United Nations Human Rights Council takes up the 
findings of United Nations Office of the High Commis-
sioner for Human Rights in its ‘‘Assessment of human 
rights concerns in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Re-
gion, People’s Republic of China,’’ and for other actions.

Whereas, on August 31, 2022, the United Nations Office of 
the High Commissioner for Human Rights published an 
‘‘Assessment of human rights concerns in the Xinjiang 
Uyghur Autonomous Region, People’s Republic of 
China,’’ also known informally as the ‘‘Bachelet Report’’ 
(‘‘OHCHR Report’’); 
Whereas the OHCHR Report concluded that the Government 
of the People’s Republic of China (‘‘PRC’’), had com-
mitted serious human rights violations, including likely 
‘‘crimes against humanity,’’ directed against Uyghurs, 
Kazaks and other predominantly Muslim Central Asian 
people in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region 
(‘‘XUAR’’); 
Whereas the OHCHR Report further concluded that the 
PRC’s implementation of counter-terrorism and counter- 
extremism strategies ‘‘has led to interlocking patterns of 
severe and undue restrictions on a wide range of human 
rights,’’ that there has been ‘‘large-scale arbitrary depri-
vation of liberty of members of Uyghur and other pre-
dominantly Muslim communities in XUAR,’’ that there 
have been ‘‘credible’’ allegations of ‘‘patterns of torture 
or ill-treatment, including forced medical treatment and 
adverse conditions of detention’’ and ‘‘undue restrictions 
of religious identity and expression,’’ as well as ‘‘coercive 
and discriminatory enforcement of family planning and 
birth control policies,’’ and that ‘‘the extent of arbitrary 
and discriminatory detention of members of Uyghur and 
other predominantly Muslim groups, pursuant to law and 
policy . . . may constitute international crimes, in par-
ticular crimes against humanity’’; 
Whereas the OHCHR Report recommends that the PRC 
Government ‘‘ensure that all laws and policies are

brought into compliance with international human rights 
law and to promptly investigate any allegations of human 
rights violations, to ensure accountability for perpetrators 
and to provide redress to victims,’’ including the release 
of individuals ‘‘who are arbitrarily deprived of their lib-
erty’’; 
Whereas the OHCHR Report further concludes that the 
‘‘human rights situation in XUAR also requires urgent 
attention by the Government, the United Nations inter-
governmental bodies and human rights system, as well as 
the international community more broadly’’; 
Whereas the Government of the PRC has engaged in an ex-
tensive campaign to first shape and then, subsequent to 
publication, minimize the impact of the OHCHR Report, 
including issuing demarches to Human Rights Council 
(‘‘HRC’’) Member States not to support the creation of 
a Commission of Inquiry to investigate the issues con-
tained in the OHCHR Report and to recommend ac-
countability measures; 
Whereas when the United States rejoined the HRC in Octo-
ber 2021, President Joseph R. Biden pledged that the 
United States would be a ‘‘constructive voice’’ at the 
Council and Secretary of State Antony Blinken promised 
to ‘‘work hard to ensure that the Council better supports 
those fighting against injustice and tyranny’’; 
Whereas U.S. leadership is needed to place the OHCHR Re-
port on the HRC agenda, and to rally other countries to 
vote in favor of the creation of a Commission of Inquiry; 
Whereas likeminded countries such as Finland, France, Ger-
many, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom have al-
ready denounced the PRC in response to previous report-

ing of atrocities in the XUAR contained in the Xinjiang 
Police Files compiled by the Victims of Communism Me-
morial Foundation, and thus would likely support a U.S. 
resolution, and Germany in particular has committed to 
placing stronger emphasis on human rights with regard 
to the PRC; 
Whereas the deadline to file a resolution to ensure that the 
HRC takes up the findings of OHCHR Report on human 
rights violations in XUAR during the current HRC ses-
sion is September 28, 2022: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-
