vancement of the common interests of those who are reg-
ularly engaged in the grain business’’; 
Whereas the origin of the National Grain and Feed Associa-
tion is rooted in 5 pressing needs faced by the grain and 
feed industry at the turn of the 19th century, including 
the need to establish a uniform system of grain inspec-
tion and grading, the need to construct a procedure for 
settling trade disputes, the need to improve rail grain 
transportation service, the need to develop fair rules to 
govern the trading of grain and feedstuffs, and the need 
to elevate the business practices of the industry; 
Whereas, in 1901, the National Grain and Feed Association 
formally established an arbitration system (which is be-
lieved to be North America’s oldest industry-based arbi-
tration system) to provide for a cost-effective and timely 
mechanism to resolve disputes involving grain, feed, and 
barge transactions; 
Whereas, with 27 regional and State-affiliated associations, 
the National Grain and Feed Association consists of 
more than 1,000 grain, feed, processing, exporting, and 
other grain-related companies that operate approximately 
8,000 facilities and handle the vast majority of all United 
States grains and oilseeds; 
Whereas the mission of the National Grain and Feed Associa-
tion is to ‘‘advocate a global open market environment to 
efficiently produce and provide a safe, abundant, afford-
able, sustainable and wholesome supply of grain, oilseeds, 
feed and related products responsive to market demand’’; 
Whereas the National Grain and Feed Association fulfills its 
mission through representation, employee safety and 
feed-quality training, communication, development of fu-

ture leaders, facilitation of the exchange of ideas, and 
education to members, government, and the public; and 
Whereas the National Grain and Feed Association has advo-
cated the interests of the men and women in the grain, 
feed, and processing industry with respect to the crafting, 
consideration, and codifying of major legislation impact-
ing the quality, standards, safety, and transportation of 
United States grains, oilseeds, and feed: Now, therefore,
