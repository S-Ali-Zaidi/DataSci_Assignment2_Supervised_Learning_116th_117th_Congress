SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF STRATEGIC RARE EARTH 
1
METAL AND RARE EARTH METAL PRODUCTS 
2
RESERVE. 
3
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that the storage of 
4
substantial quantities of rare earth metals and rare earth 
5
metal products will— 
6
(1) diminish the vulnerability of the United 
7
States to the effects of a severe supply chain inter-
8
ruption; and 
9
(2) provide limited protection from the short- 
10
term consequences of an interruption in supplies of 
11
rare earth metal products, particularly such prod-
12
ucts required for defense manufacturing and use. 
13
(b) STATEMENT OF POLICY.—It is the policy of the 
14
United States to provide for the establishment of a stra-
15
tegic rare earth metals and rare earth metal products re-
16
serve. 
17
(c) REPORT REQUIRED.— 
18
(1) IN
GENERAL.—Not later than 270 days 
19
after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Sec-

4
year in the event of a supply disruption. 
5
(2) CONSIDERATIONS.—In developing the re-
6

18
priate quantities to support the strategic requirements de-
19
scribed in the report.
