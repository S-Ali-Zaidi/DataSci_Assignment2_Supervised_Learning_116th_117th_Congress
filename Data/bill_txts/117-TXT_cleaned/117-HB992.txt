(1) United States taxpayer-funded research

should not be used to benefit the People’s Republic

4
ed by Secretary of Defense Mark Esper.

6
Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate,

there were more than 35,000 foreign nationals in-
8
cluding 10,000 from China conducting research in

12
Chinese multinational conglomerate to develop new 
13
algorithms and advanced biometric security tech-
14
niques for crowd surveillance capabilities,’’ while an-
15

neering, and math (STEM) fields as nontraditional

collectors of intellectual property, but has also noted 
2
that ‘‘the vast majority of the 1.4 million inter-
3
national scholars on U.S. campuses pose no threat 
4
to their host institutions, fellow classmates, or re-
5
search fields. On the contrary, these international 
6
visitors represent valuable contributors to their cam-
7
puses’ achievements, providing financial benefits, di-
8
versity of ideas, sought expertise, and opportunities
