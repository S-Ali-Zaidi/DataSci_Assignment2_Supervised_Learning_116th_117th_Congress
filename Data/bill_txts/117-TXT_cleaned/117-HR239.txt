RESOLUTION 
Commemorating the 50th anniversary of Bangladesh’s 
independence. 
Whereas the region of Bengal in South Asia is home to an 
ancient civilization with a rich cultural and literary tradi-
tion; 
Whereas the 1947 partition of India created an East Bengal 
province, which became part of Pakistan, and in 1954, as 
part of the One-Unit program, East Bengal became East 
Pakistan; 
Whereas, in December 1970, Pakistan held its first election, 
and despite East Pakistan winning a majority of seats in 
Parliament, the West Pakistan-based military leadership 
refused to cede power to the majority and instead im-
posed martial law in East Pakistan;

Whereas, on March 26, 1971, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman de-
clared Bangladesh’s independence from West Pakistan; 
Whereas, in December 1971, following a nine-month long war 
that resulted in millions of displaced people and deaths, 
the 
Pakistani 
Army 
surrendered

Indian 
and 
Bangladeshi allied forces; 
Whereas, on February 14, 1972, the late Senator Edward 
Kennedy at a speech at Dhaka University said, ‘‘The 
struggle of the people of Bangladesh . . . evokes the 
greatest memories of our past’’ and exemplifies a shared 
love of freedom with the American people; and 
Whereas, in August 2017, citing parallels between the dis-
placement of Bengalis during the 1971 war, the Govern-
ment of Bangladesh accepted more than 700,000 
Rohingya refugees fleeing genocide in Burma: Now,
