A BILL 
To direct the Secretaries of Health and Human Services, 
Defense, and Veterans Affairs to end American over- 
dependence on Chinese pharmaceuticals by encouraging 
the growth of a robust domestic medicine supply chain 
for generic drugs, to empower the Food and Drug Ad-
ministration to issue boxed warnings in the case of crit-
ical contamination, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Safe Medicine Act’’. 
2
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
3
Congress finds the following: 
4
(1) Following the enactment of the Drug Price 
5
Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 
6
1984 (Public Law 98–417), the People’s Republic of 
7
China was able to corner the market on generic 
8
drugs, pharmaceutical ingredients, and related mate-
9
rials through its steady supply of readily exploitable 
10
labor and threadbare safety regulations. Ninety per-
11
cent of the medications taken by individuals in the 
12
United States are generic, rendering them especially 
13
dependent on supplies originating in the People’s 
14
Republic of China. 
15
(2) The number of drugs produced outside of 
16
the United States doubled between 2001 and 2008. 
17
At present, 80 percent of the active pharmaceutical 
18
ingredients used in drugs taken by individuals in the 
19
United States come from overseas, mainly the Peo-
20
ple’s Republic of China and the Republic of India. 
21
The United States no longer produces penicillin, 
22
with the last fermentation plant phasing out of pro-
23
duction in 2004. 
24
(3) In 2008, the counterfeiting of Heparin pre-
25
cursor chemicals by a Chinese-based pharmaceutical 
26

•HR 5003 IH
plant led to the deaths of 81 individuals in the 
1
United States, with 785 more being severely injured. 
2
The counterfeit product cost one-hundredth of the 
3
price of the real product, indicating a clear economic 
4
motive for distributing contaminated materials. 
5
(4) In 2018, the Secretary of Health and 
6
Human Services, acting through the Commissioner 
7
of Food and Drugs, issued recalls of Valsartan, 
8
Losartan, and Irbesartan, common blood pressure 
9
drugs. The Secretary of Health and Human Serv-
10
ices, acting through the Commissioner of Food and 
11
Drugs, determined that versions of such drugs have 
12
been contaminated as a result of Chinese and Indian 
13
manufacturing practices and that one Chinese com-
14
pany, Zhejaiang Huahai Pharmaceuticals, had ‘‘sys-
15
temic problems of supervision’’, with the potent car-
16
cinogens N–Nitroso–N–methyl–4–aminobutyric acid 
17
(NMBA), N–Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), and 
18
N–Nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA), for a period of 4 
19
years before being detected. 
20
(5) During an October 30, 2020, hearing before 
21
the Health Subcommittee of the Energy and Com-
22
merce Committee of the House of Representatives, it 
23
was discovered that the Food and Drug Administra-
24
tion (FDA) has data on active pharmaceutical ingre-
25

H5003

•HR 5003 IH
dient facilities and locations because they regulate 
1
and inspect them. But the FDA does not know how 
2
much volume is produced at these facilities. A single 
3
plant could make 90 percent of global supply or 10 
4
percent, but the FDA does not know. 
5
(6) The FDA cannot determine the United 
6
States dependence because it does not thoroughly 
7
regulate or inspect the facilities where the key 
8
chemicals and raw materials to make active pharma-
9
ceutical ingredients are made. 
10
(7) Domestic pharmaceutical facilities undergo 
11
far more rigorous inspections than manufacturing 
12
facilities in the People’s Republic of China. Since 
13
early 2020, the FDA recalled its inspectors from 
14
China and elsewhere to protect them from the 
15
Coronavirus. As a result, FDA inspections have 
16
plummeted to near zero for the past year. 
17
(8) In 2010, the People’s Republic of China 
18
embargoed the shipment of rare earth metals to 
19
Japan as political leverage in its negotiations over a 
20
boating incident that took place between the 2 coun-
21
tries in the East China Sea. National security ex-
22
perts warn that if such an incident were to take 
23
place between the United States and China, and 
24
China were to embargo medicine and pharmaceutical

ingredients, the United States would be helpless.

and pharmaceutical ingredients poses a national se-

9
(9) The United States is dependent on other 
10
nations, particularly China, for our generic medicine 
11
and key ingredients that are used to make these 
12
drugs. Inspections at Chinese facilities are inad-
13
equate compared to inspections at facilities located 
14
in the United States. 
15
(10) The United States cannot rely on ques-
16
tionable inspections at facilities located in China. 
17
(11) To protect Americans, we must encourage 
18
the development of essential generic drug manufac-
19
turing here in the United States and countries allied 
20
with the United States in a current defense effort 
21
