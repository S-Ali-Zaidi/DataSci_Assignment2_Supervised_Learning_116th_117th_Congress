1
spoken advocate for the health care needs of his pa-

that, through no fault of his own, plaintiff has lost

over $39,000 in government Medicare incentive pay-
8
ments that he was entitled to by providing Family 
9
Practice services’’ and that ‘‘the evidence strongly 
10
supports plaintiff’s argument that he was providing 
11
Family Practice services and should have been clas-
12
sified as such, but a coding error denied plaintiff 
13
this status for several years’’.
