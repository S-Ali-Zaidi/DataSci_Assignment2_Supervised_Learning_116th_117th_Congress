Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘LGBTQI+ and Wom-

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) According to the New-York Historical Soci-
8
ety Museum & Library, only 13 percent of named 
9
historical figures in textbooks across the United 
10
States are women. 
11
(2) In 2017, the National Women’s History 
12
Museum analyzed elementary and secondary edu-
13
cation standards in social studies for all 50 States 
14
and the District of Columbia and found that ap-
15
proximately 1 woman was mentioned for every 3 
16
men in these standards. 
17
(3) The Museum also found that 53 percent of 
18
the mentions of women’s history were included with-
19
in the context of domestic roles, as opposed to the 
20
20 percent that were included within the context of 
21
voting rights and suffrage and 2 percent that were 
22
included within the context of being in the work-
23
force.

(4) Countless studies show that when youth feel 
1
seen and affirmed in their curricula, they experience 
2
improved academic engagement and achievement. In 
3
research the National Women’s Law Center con-
4
ducted in partnership with Latina girls in 2019, the 
5
girls reported that when they feel represented in 
6
their curricula, they feel a powerful sense of belong-
7
ing and an emphasized identity of resilience. 
8
(5) According to the National Women’s History 
9
Alliance, only 3 States (Illinois, Florida, and Lou-
10
isiana) have mandated that women’s history be 
11
taught in elementary, middle, and high schools. 
12
(6) According to GLSEN, only 7 States (Cali-
13
fornia, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Nevada, New 
14
Jersey, and Oregon) have passed legislation in sup-
15
port of an LGBTQI+ inclusive curriculum. 
16
(7) According to the Museum of disABILITY 
17
History, as of 2014, 24 States had established dis-
18
ability awareness curriculum for public schools or 
19
were in the process of passing legislation to do so. 
20
(8) In March 2022, Governor Ron DeSantis of 
21
Florida signed HB 1557 into law. Commonly known 
22
as the ‘‘Don’t Say Gay or Trans’’ legislation, this 
23
law prevents teachers from administering instruction

on sexual orientation and gender identity in kinder-
1
garten through third grade.

(9) GLSEN reports that 9 other States in addi-
3
tion to Florida (Alabama, Arizona, Idaho, Iowa, 
4
Mississippi, Oklahoma, New Hampshire, Tennessee, 
5
and Texas) have recently passed curriculum censor-
6
ship laws that prohibit honest teaching about race, 
7
gender, or LGBTQI+ communities. 
8
(10) According to the African American Policy 
9
Forum, at least 16 States have passed racial and 
10
gender equity curriculum prohibitions, and 15 other 
11
States are considering them. 
12
(11) According to Education Week, at least 15 
13
States are considering nearly 30 bills that would af-
14
fect discussions or interactions with LGBTQI+ 
15
youth in schools during the 2021–22 legislative ses-
16
sion. 
17
(12) According to GLSEN, 4 States (Lou-
18
isiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Texas) have ‘‘no 
19
promo homo’’ laws in place that prevent positive and 
20
affirming representations of LGBTQI+ identities in 
21
schools. 
22
(13) LGBTQI+ youth already experience high 
23
rates of mistreatment in schools:

(A) According to GLSEN’s 2019 National 
1
School Climate Survey, over 80 percent of 
2
LGBTQI+ students ages 13 to 21 report being 
3
verbally harassed during any given school year. 
4
(B) According to the National Center for 
5
Transgender Equality’s 2015 U.S. Transgender 
6
Survey, 77 percent of transgender K–12 stu-
7
dents experienced anti-transgender mistreat-
8
ment, including verbal harassment, and physical 
9
or sexual assault. 
10
(C) According to a 2021 survey, 45 per-
11
cent of intersex students reported experiencing 
12
gender-based 
harassment 
or 
discrimination 
13
from teachers or faculty during the 2021 school 
14
year. 
15
(14) Nationally, only 19.4 percent of respond-
16
ents to GLSEN’s 2019 National School Climate 
17
Survey said they had been taught any positive rep-
18
resentations of LGBTQI+ people, history, or events 
19
in their schools. 
20
(15) Results from GLSEN’s 2019 National 
21
School Climate Survey also indicate that, compared 
22
to students in schools without an LGBTQI+-inclu-
23
sive curriculum, LGBTQI+ students in schools with

an LGBTQI+-inclusive curriculum were less likely

(A) hear homophobic slurs or negative re-

(B) feel unsafe because of their sexuality

(C) miss school because they felt unsafe or

(16) Women and LGBTQI+ people—including 
10
those of color and those with disabilities—have been 
11
and continue to be powerful agents of change in 
12
United States history. For example: 
13
(A) Black and brown transgender women, 
14
including Marsha P. Johnson, Miss Major Grif-
15
fin-Gracy, 
Sylvia 
Rivera, 
and 
Storme´

DeLarverie were prominent leaders and partici-
17
pants of the 1969 protests against unjust police 
18
raids of the New York City gay bar, the Stone-
19

20
for LGBTQI+ justice.

5

6
including the Individuals with Disabilities Edu-

8
Act of 1973, the Americans with Disabilities

(D) Alice Wong is a queer disabled activist

(E) Ruby Bridges, a Black civil rights ac-
16
tivist, pioneered the school desegregation move-
17
ment and was among the first Black students 
18
to integrate schools in the South at the age of 
19
six. Ruby’s story, particularly as it was memori-
20

3
ing sexual orientation and gender identity) com-
4
pounds with discrimination on the basis of other 
5
identities, such as race, national identity, religious 
6
background, or disability. Within marginalized 
7
groups, compounding layers of discrimination across 
8
intersectional identities often results in the most

marginalized members of a group being silenced or 
10
left out of historical narratives. 
11
(18) All women, LGBTQI+ people, and those 
12
living at the intersection of those identities, deserve 
13
to be represented in classrooms across the country

in an accurate, unbiased, intersectional, and inclu-
