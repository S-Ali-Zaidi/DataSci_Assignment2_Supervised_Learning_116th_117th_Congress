RESOLUTION 
Recognizing World Oceans Day and the necessity to protect, 
conserve, maintain, and rebuild our ocean and its resources. 
Whereas the ocean covers more than 70 percent of our plan-
et’s surface; 
Whereas the ocean generates the oxygen we breathe, regu-
lates our climate and weather patterns, supplies food, is 
a source of cultural value, supports tourism and trade, 
and is an untapped energy resource; 
Whereas Indigenous people have stewarded our oceans and 
are deeply connected to the oceans as a key component 
of culture, food security, and spirituality;

Whereas scientists estimate more than 80 percent of the 
ocean remains unexplored and the United States has 
committed to advance a National Strategy on Ocean 
Mapping, Exploration, and Characterization; 
Whereas the health of our ocean is a reflection of the health 
of our planet; 
Whereas the United States has joined the High Level Panel 
for a Sustainable Ocean Economy and committed to ad-
vancing a national sustainable economy plan by 2026; 
Whereas the White House Ocean Policy Committee has com-
mitted to advancing coordinated Federal action on ocean 
and coastal management, science, technology, and ad-
vancing an ocean-climate action plan; 
Whereas 2022 marks the second year of the United Nations 
Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development 
(in this resolution referred to as ‘‘the Decade’’); 
Whereas the Decade will help accelerate research to address 
gaps in ocean science, strengthen international coopera-
tion, and improve ocean management; 
Whereas a scientific priority of the Decade is to create a com-
prehensive digital atlas of the ocean and strengthen 
ocean observations; 
Whereas changes in ocean chemistry, temperature, and bio-
diversity pose a very real threat to marine resources, in-
dustries, and jobs; 
Whereas approximately one-fourth of the carbon dioxide in 
the atmosphere dissolves into our ocean, causing water 
chemistry to change and become more acidic;

Whereas ocean acidification harms oysters, mussels, lobsters, 
clams, corals, and other species building shells and skele-
tons and reproducing; 
Whereas some finfish experience neurological changes in acid-
ic waters, altering their behaviors and actions; 
Whereas 45 percent of all marine mammals on the IUCN 
Red List of Threatened Species have been affected by 
lost and abandoned fishing gear; 
Whereas according to the United Nations Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change, the ocean has taken up more 
than 90 percent of excess heat in the climate system 
since 1970, and marine heat waves are very likely to be-
come longer lasting, more intense, and more extensive; 
Whereas according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration, 80 percent of pollution to the ocean 
comes from land; 
Whereas increased temperatures and nutrient runoff can re-
sult in harmful algal blooms that accumulate, die, decom-
pose, and consume oxygen, leaving waterways in a 
hypoxic or anoxic state that can result in massive fish 
kills and the formation of ‘‘dead zones’’ where marine life 
cannot survive; 
Whereas the decrease in biodiversity, and decline and shifts 
in distribution of fish, will affect the livelihoods and food 
security of coastal communities; 
Whereas Tribes have a right and a deep cultural and histor-
ical connection to the fisheries threatened by changing 
ocean conditions; 
Whereas according to the United Nations, more than 
11,000,000 tons of plastic end up in the ocean each year;

Whereas recent studies suggest that fishing gear could make 
up 46–70 percent of the floating macroplastic in the 
ocean gyres by weight; 
Whereas marine debris harms our coastal economies, endan-
gers marine life, destroys important marine habitats, 
propagates invasive species, and creates hazardous condi-
tions for the maritime industry; 
Whereas tiny pieces of plastics, fibers, fragments, and 
microbeads also make their way into marine life, blocking 
digestive tracts, altering growth, and in some cases kill-
ing animals and marine organisms; 
Whereas marine debris is considered a growing global crisis 
that requires collaborative work with partners from 
across the world; 
Whereas the United Nations has recognized that vulnerable 
communities disproportionately suffer the consequences 
of environmental degradation caused by plastic pollution 
and recognizes that environmental justice should be a 
consideration in marine conservation; 
Whereas we need to improve our understanding of the impli-
cations of environmental stressors, such as ocean acidifi-
cation, harmful algal blooms, hypoxia, marine debris, 
warming ocean temperatures, overfishing, and rising sea 
levels; 
Whereas many of these environmental stressors are indicators 
of a changing climate and threaten our economy and the 
livelihood of vulnerable coastal communities; 
Whereas 5–30 percent of global harvestable fish stocks are 
killed by ghost gear every year threatening global food se-
curity, coastal communities and fisher livelihoods;

Whereas across the United States, coastal communities con-
tribute $8,300,000,000,000 to the United States econ-
omy annually as well as support 55,800,000 jobs; 
Whereas, in 2008, the United Nations General Assembly des-
ignated June 8 as ‘‘World Oceans Day’’; and 
Whereas World Oceans Day provides an opportunity to re-
commit to protect, conserve, maintain, and rebuild our 
ocean and its resources: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) recognizes World Oceans Day and affirms 
2
the individual and collective duty, both nationally 
3
and internationally, to protect, conserve, maintain, 
4
and rebuild our ocean and its resources; 
5
(2) affirms the stewardship of ocean resources, 
6
cultures, and communities that are vital to both 
7
present and future generations; and 
8
(3) commits to increasing the investment of 
9
Federal funds in scientific research and monitoring 
10
to better understand our changing ocean and em-
11
power the Federal Government to address and miti-
12
gate the effects of the changing climate, solve man-
13
agement challenges, and accomplish the goals of the 
14
United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sus-
15
tainable Development.
