RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
Congress should continue to support the A–10 Thunder-
bolt II attack aircraft program, also known as the Wart-
hog and A–10C or OA–10C. 
Whereas the A–10 Thunderbolt II attack aircraft (referred to 
in this preamble as the ‘‘A–10’’)— 
(1) has seen action in every major United States 
Military conflict since the first production A–10 was de-
livered to Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in October 
1975; and 
(2) since that time, has received several upgrades 
that are reflected in the 281 A–10s in service as of the 
date of adoption of this resolution;

Whereas, since Operation Desert Storm in 1991, the A–10 
has become a preferred close air support platform for 
ground troops, striking fear in the enemies of the United 
States and inspiring pride in the members of the Armed 
Forces; 
Whereas the A–10, which has been the backbone of the close 
air support mission of the Air Force for more than 40 
years, has proven to be a highly accurate, mobile, and du-
rable weapons-delivery platform that can be used against 
all ground targets; 
Whereas the A–10 supports close air support with a variety 
of forward-firing, free-fall, and precision-guided muni-
tions; 
Whereas the A–10 is able to perform combat search and res-
cue, air interdiction, armed reconnaissance, suppression 
of enemy air defenses, special operations forces support, 
and countersea operations in low-threat and high-threat 
environments, day or night; 
Whereas the A–10 provides the Air Force with an extensive 
ability to survey the battlefield and then fix, engage, tar-
get, and destroy a wide range of mobile and fixed targets 
as an arsenal aircraft, including tanks and other highly 
armored vehicles in quantity; 
Whereas the A–10 was specifically designed with protection 
from small-arms fire, including self-sealing fuel tanks, re-
dundant flight controls, and a titanium cockpit tub, 
which has proven vital to the safe return of pilots despite 
heavy damage from enemy ground fire; 
Whereas the A–10 has the lowest rate of friendly fire inci-
dents of any combat fighter or bomber;

•HRES 307 IH 
Whereas the A–10 has one of the largest carrying capacities 
for a fighter-type aircraft and can carry a wide range of 
munitions and electronic countermeasures without sacri-
ficing air-to-ground capabilities; 
Whereas the close air support provided by the A–10, which 
has proven invaluable on the battlefield, is better than 
the close air support provided by any other fighter air-
craft because— 
(1) the A–10 has excellent maneuverability at low 
air speeds and altitudes; and 
(2) the close air support provided by the A–10 is 
simple and effective; 
Whereas the slower airspeeds of the A–10 enable longer loiter 
times, increasing support to troops in contact and battle-
field coverage; 
Whereas, of all combat planes in the arsenal of the United 
States, the A–10 is the least expensive to operate and 
purchase; 
Whereas, while the A–10 flew only 30 percent of the total 
sorties of the Air Force during Operation Desert Storm 
in 1991, these aircraft achieved more than half of the 
confirmed Iraqi equipment losses and fired 90 percent of 
the precision-guided Maverick missiles; 
Whereas, during Operation Allied Force in 1999— 
(1) A–10s destroyed more field-deployed Serbian 
weaponry than any other allied weapon system; and 
(2) combat search and rescue support from the A– 
10 was 100 percent effective, successfully rescuing 1 F– 
117 pilot and 1 F–16CG pilot; 
Whereas, during Operation Enduring Freedom in 2001 and 
Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003, the A–10 flew 32 per-

•HRES 307 IH 
cent of the combat sorties in both theaters, and from 
2006 to late 2013, the A–10 flew 19 percent of close air 
operations in Iraq and Afghanistan; 
Whereas the A–10 is an effective close air support platform 
to counter violent extremist organizations, including the 
Islamic State in Iraq and Syria; 
Whereas the continuing demands for close air support in Iraq 
and Afghanistan keep the A–10 a relevant platform, but 
one that requires upgrades; 
Whereas, if the A–10 is removed from service, certain gaps 
in responsive close air support, forward air controller, air 
interdiction, strike control and reconnaissance, and com-
bat search and rescue support could widen; 
Whereas the A–10 can be serviced and operated with high 
sortie rates from austere bases with limited facilities or 
logistical support near battle areas, including unprepared 
dirt, grass, and narrow road runways, and from airfields 
that are too short or rough to handle fast jets; 
Whereas global power is essential to preserving global secu-
rity and stability, and the A–10 is essential to ensuring 
that the United States is able to continue providing un-
matched airpower, to gain and maintain air superiority, 
and to extend its global reach; 
Whereas the A–10 program supports the Air Force, including 
the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve; 
Whereas, as of the date of adoption of this resolution, the A– 
10 is flying in operational combat squadrons at— 
(1) Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona; 
(2) Eglin Air Force Base, Florida; 
(3) Moody Air Force Base, Georgia; 
(4) Gowen Field Air National Guard Base, Idaho;

(5) Fort Wayne Air National Guard Station, Indi-

(6) Warfield Air National Guard Base, Maryland; 
(7) Selfridge Air National Guard Base, Michigan; 
(8) Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri; 
(9) Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada; and 
(10) Osan Air Base, Republic of Korea; 
Whereas the 355th Wing at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, 
with an inventory of 84 A–10s— 
(1) has deployed 12 times since September 11, 
2001, primarily in support of troops on the ground; and 
(2) is responsible for training all A–10 pilots; 
Whereas the 175th Wing at Warfield Air National Guard 
Base, with an inventory of 21 A–10s, has deployed 6 
times since September 11, 2001, primarily in support of 
troops on the ground; and 
Whereas the 442nd Fighter Wing at Whiteman Air Force 
Base, with an inventory of 27 A–10s, has deployed 9 
times since September 11, 2001, primarily in support of 
troops on the ground: Now, therefore, be it
