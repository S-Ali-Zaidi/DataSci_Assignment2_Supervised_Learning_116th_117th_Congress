SEC. 2. PURPOSES; RESTATEMENT DOES NOT CHANGE 
1
MEANING OR EFFECT OF EXISTING LAW. 
2
(a) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this Act are— 
3
(1) to make revisions in title 5, United States 
4
Code, as necessary to keep the title current; and 
5
(2) to make technical amendments to improve 
6
the United States Code. 
7
(b) RESTATEMENT DOES NOT CHANGE MEANING OR 
8
EFFECT OF EXISTING LAW.— 
9
(1) IN GENERAL.—The restatement of existing 
10
law enacted by this Act does not change the mean-
11
ing or effect of the existing law. The restatement in-
12
corporates in title 5, United States Code, various 
13
provisions that were enacted separately over a period 
14
of years, reorganizing them, conforming style and 
15
terminology, modernizing obsolete language, and cor-
16
recting drafting errors. These changes serve to re-
17
move ambiguities, contradictions, and other imper-
18
fections, but they do not change the meaning or ef-
19
fect of the existing law or impair the precedential 
20
value of earlier judicial decisions or other interpreta-
21
tions. 
22
(2) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.— 
23
(A) IN
GENERAL.—Notwithstanding the 
24
plain meaning rule or other rules of statutory 
25
construction, a change in wording made in the 
26
23:47 Nov 15, 2021
H5961

•HR 5961 IH
restatement of existing law enacted by this Act 
1
serves to clarify the existing law as indicated in 
2
paragraph (1), but not to change the meaning 
3
or effect of the existing law. 
4
(B) REVISION NOTES.—Subparagraph (A) 
5
applies whether or not a change in wording is 
6
explained by a revision note appearing in a con-
7
gressional report accompanying this Act. If 
8
such a revision note does appear, a court shall 
9
consider the revision note in interpreting the 
10
change.
