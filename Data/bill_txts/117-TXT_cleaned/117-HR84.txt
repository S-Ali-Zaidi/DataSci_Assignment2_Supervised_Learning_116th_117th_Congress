RESOLUTION 
Authorizing and directing Committee on House Administra-
tion to report recommendations to the House to enhance 
House Chamber security, and for other purposes. 
Whereas it is incumbent upon the Speaker to provide for the 
physical security of the House, its Members, and its em-
ployees; 
Whereas, on January 12, 2021, the Speaker directed the Act-
ing Sergeant-at-Arms of the House of Representatives to 
require all persons entering the House Chamber to un-
dergo enhanced security screening; 
Whereas in the midst of a pandemic, the implementation of

lines; 
Whereas the current locations of the magnetometers sur-
rounding the House Chamber have caused significant 
delays for Members and staff attempting to access the 
House floor; 
Whereas the implementation of enhanced security screenings 
directly outside the House Chamber could impede Mem-
bers of Congress from undertaking their constitutional 
duty to vote; 
Whereas the implementation of enhanced screenings diverts 
key United States Capitol Police resources from security 
concerns in the broader Capitol complex; 
Whereas the Committee on House Administration is charged 
with oversight of the day-to-day operations of the House 
of Representatives; and 
Whereas alternatives to these locations exist which would 
maintain the same level of Chamber security but signifi-
cantly reduce the delay of Members seeking access to the 
House Chamber: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That, no later than February 28, 2021, the 
1
Committee on House Administration is authorized and di-

rected to report recommendations to the House that 
3
would—

(1) enhance House Chamber security;

Chamber;
