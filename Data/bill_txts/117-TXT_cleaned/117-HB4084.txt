(1) methane is a potent heat-trapping gas that 
1
absorbs 28 to 36 times the quantity of energy that 
2
carbon dioxide absorbs over a 100-year period; 
3
(2) increased methane concentrations in the at-
4
mosphere are responsible for approximately 25 per-
5
cent of observed global warming; 
6
(3) approximately 1⁄3 of global anthropogenic 
7
methane emissions are produced by the production 
8
and transmission of fossil fuels; 
9
(4) recent estimates suggest that methane emis-
10
sions from oil and natural gas operations in the 
11
United States are 60 percent higher than previously 
12
believed, representing 2.3 percent of natural gas pro-
13
duction; 
14
(5) methane emissions from oil and natural gas 
15
operations in the United States represent approxi-
16
mately $2,000,000,000 in lost natural gas that could 
17
be used to fuel 10,000,000 homes; 
18
(6) estimates from the International Energy 
19
Agency suggest that 1⁄2 of methane emissions from 
20
global oil and natural gas supply chains may be 
21
eliminated at zero net cost; 
22
(7) some oil and natural gas companies have 
23
announced plans to reduce methane emissions from 
24
the operations of those companies to below 0.2 per-

cent of production, demonstrating that significant 
1
reductions in methane emissions are technically and 
2
economically feasible; and 
3
(8) numerous companies in the United States 
4
are developing innovative technologies to allow oil 
5
and natural gas companies to more cost-effectively 
6
detect and reduce methane emissions.
