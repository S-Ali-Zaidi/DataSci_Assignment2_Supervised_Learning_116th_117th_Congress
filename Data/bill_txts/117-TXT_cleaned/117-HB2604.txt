SEC. 2. PERMITTING. 
1
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
2
gress that— 
3
(1) critical minerals are fundamental to the 
4
economy, competitiveness, and security of the United 
5
States; 
6
(2) to the maximum extent practicable, the crit-
7
ical mineral needs of the United States should be 
8
satisfied by minerals, elements, substances, and ma-
9
terials responsibly produced and recycled in the 
10
United States; and 
11
(3) the current Federal permitting process is an 
12
impediment to mineral production and the mineral 
13
security of the United States. 
14
(b) COORDINATION ON PERMITTING PROCESS.— 
15
(1) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary, in consulta-
16
tion with appropriate Federal agencies, shall, to the 
17
maximum extent practicable, with respect to the 
18
Federal permitting and review process for critical 
19
mineral projects on Federal land— 
20
(A) establish and adhere to timelines and 
21
schedules for the consideration of, and final de-
22
cisions regarding, applications, operating plans, 
23
leases, licenses, permits, and other use author-
24
izations for mineral-related activities on Federal 
25
land;

•HR 2604 IH
(B) establish clear, quantifiable, and tem-
1
poral permitting performance goals and track-
2
ing progress against those goals; 
3
(C) engage in early collaboration among 
4
agencies, project sponsors, and affected stake-
5
holders— 
6
(i) to incorporate and address the in-
7
terests of each such agency, sponsor, and 
8
stakeholder; and 
9
(ii) to minimize delays; 
10
(D) ensure transparency and accountability 
11
by using cost-effective information technology to 
12
collect and disseminate information regarding 
13
individual critical mineral projects and agency 
14
performance; 
15
(E) engage in early and active consultation 
16
with State and local governments and Indian 
17
Tribes to avoid conflicts or duplication of effort, 
18
resolve concerns, and allow for concurrent, 
19
rather than sequential, State, local, Tribal, and 
20
Federal environmental and regulatory reviews; 
21
(F) meet or exceed the performance 
22
metrics contained in subsection (g);

(G) expand and institutionalize permitting 
1
and review process improvements that have 
2
proven effective; 
3
(H) develop mechanisms to better commu-
4
nicate priorities and resolve disputes among 
5
agencies at the national, regional, State, and 
6
local levels; and 
7
(I) develop other practices to improve the 
8
regulatory processes, such as preapplication 
9
procedures.

(2) CONSIDERATIONS.—In carrying out para-
11
graph (1), the lead agency shall consider deferring 
12
to, and relying on, baseline data, analyses, and re-
13
views performed by State agencies with jurisdiction 
14
over the proposed critical mineral project. 
15
(3) MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT.—The lead 
16
agency with respect to a critical mineral project on 
17
Federal land, in consultation with any other Federal 
18
agency with jurisdiction over such project, shall, 
19
upon request of the project sponsor, a State or local 
20
government, an Indian Tribe, or other entity such 
21
lead agency determines appropriate, establish a 
22
memorandum of agreement with the project sponsor, 
23
a State or local government, an Indian Tribe, or an-
24
other entity such lead agency determines appropriate
