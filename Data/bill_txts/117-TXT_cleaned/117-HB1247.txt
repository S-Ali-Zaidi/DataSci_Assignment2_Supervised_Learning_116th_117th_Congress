Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3

SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
6
It is the sense of Congress that:

•HR 1247 IH
(1) Adopted children may be most at risk of ex-
1
periencing an unregulated custody transfer because 
2
the challenges associated with adoptions, including 
3
the child’s mental health needs and the difficulties 
4
many families face in acquiring support services, 
5
may lead families to seek out unregulated custody 
6
transfers. 
7
(2) Many adopted children experience trauma, 
8
and the disruption and placement in another home 
9
by unregulated custody transfer creates additional 
10
trauma and instability for the child. 
11
(3) Children who experience an unregulated 
12
custody transfer may be placed with families who 
13
have not completed required child welfare or crimi-
14
nal background checks or clearances. 
15
(4) Social services agencies and courts are often 
16
unaware of the placement of children through un-
17
regulated custody transfer and therefore do not con-
18
duct assessments on the child’s safety and well-being 
19
in such placements. 
20
(5) Such lack of placement oversight places a 
21
child at risk for future abuse and increases the like-
22
lihood that the child may experience— 
23
(A) physical, sexual, or emotional abuse or 
24
neglect; 
25
00:52 Mar 21, 2021

•HR 1247 IH
(B) contact with unsafe adults or youth; 
1
and 
2
(C) exposure to unsafe or isolated environ-
3
ments. 
4
(6) The caregivers with whom a child is placed 
5
through unregulated custody transfer often have no 
6
legal responsibility with respect to such child, plac-
7
ing the child at risk for additional unregulated cus-
8
tody transfers. 
9
(7) Such caregivers also may not have complete 
10
records, including birth, medical, or immigration 
11
records. 
12
(8) A child adopted through intercountry adop-
13
tion may be at risk of not acquiring United States 
14
citizenship if an unregulated custody transfer occurs 
15
before the adoptive parents complete all necessary 
16
steps to finalize the adoption of such child. 
17
(9) Engaging in, or offering to engage in, un-
18
regulated custody transfer is a form of child abuse.
