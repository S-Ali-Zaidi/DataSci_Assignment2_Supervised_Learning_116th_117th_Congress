A BILL 
To provide collective bargaining rights for fire fighters and 
emergency medical services personnel employed by States 
or their political subdivisions, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Fire Fighters and

EMS Employer-Employee Cooperation Act’’.

SEC. 2. PURPOSE AND POLICY.

Congress declares that the following is the policy of 
7
the United States:

•HR 2586 IH
(1) Labor-management relationships and part-
1
nerships are based on trust, mutual respect, open 
2
communication, bilateral consensual problem solving, 
3
and shared accountability. Labor-management co-
4
operation fully utilizes the strengths of both parties 
5
to best serve the interests of the public, operating as 
6
a team, to carry out the fire and EMS mission in 
7
a quality work environment. In many fire and EMS 
8
agencies, it is the union that provides the institu-
9
tional stability as elected leaders and appointees 
10
come and go. 
11
(2) State and local fire and EMS personnel 
12
play an essential role in the efforts of the United 
13
States to detect, prevent, and respond to terrorist 
14
attacks, and to respond to natural disasters, haz-
15
ardous materials, and other mass casualty incidents. 
16
State and local fire and EMS personnel, as first re-
17
sponders, are a component of the National Incident 
18
Management System, developed by the Department 
19
of Homeland Security to coordinate response to and 
20
recovery from terrorism, major natural disasters, 
21
and other major emergencies. Fire and EMS em-
22
ployer-employee cooperation is essential in meeting 
23
these needs and is, therefore, in the National inter-
24
est.

•HR 2586 IH
(3) The Federal Government needs to encour-
1
age conciliation, mediation, and arbitration to aid 
2
and encourage employers and the representatives of 
3
their employees to reach and maintain agreements 
4
concerning rates of pay, hours, and working condi-
5
tions, and to make all reasonable efforts through ne-
6
gotiations to settle their differences by mutual agree-
7
ment reached through collective bargaining or by 
8
such methods as may be provided for in any applica-
9
ble agreement for the settlement of disputes. 
10
(4) The absence of adequate cooperation be-
11
tween fire and EMS employers and employees has 
12
implications for the security of employees and can 
13
affect interstate and intrastate commerce. The lack 
14
of such labor-management cooperation can detrimen-
15
tally impact the upgrading of fire and emergency 
16
medical services of local communities, the health and 
17
well-being of fire and EMS personnel, and the mo-
18
rale of fire and EMS departments. Additionally, 
19
these factors could have significant commercial re-
20
percussions. Moreover, providing minimal standards 
21
for collective bargaining negotiations in the fire and 
22
EMS sector can prevent industrial strife between 
23
labor and management that interferes with the nor-
24
mal flow of commerce.

(5) Many States and localities already provide 
1
fire and EMS personnel with collective bargaining 
2
rights comparable to or greater than the rights and 
3
responsibilities set forth in this Act, and such State 
4
and local laws should be respected.
