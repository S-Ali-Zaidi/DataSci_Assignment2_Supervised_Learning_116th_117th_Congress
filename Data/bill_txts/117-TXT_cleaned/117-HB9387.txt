SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) During a decade of civil rights reforms, 
3
Congress passed title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 
4
1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d et seq.) (referred to in this 
5
section as ‘‘title VI’’), which prohibits discrimination 
6
based on race, color, or national origin in federally 
7
funded programs and activities; title IX of the Edu-
8
cation Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. 1681 et 
9
seq.) (referred to in this section as ‘‘title IX’’), 
10
which prohibits sex discrimination in federally fund-
11
ed education programs and activities; section 504 of 
12
the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) (re-
13
ferred to in this section as ‘‘section 504’’), which 
14
prohibits discrimination based on disability in feder-
15
ally funded programs and activities; and the Age 
16
04:35 Dec 08, 2022
H9387

•HR 9387 IH
Discrimination Act of 1975 (42 U.S.C. 6101 et 
1
seq.), which prohibits discrimination based on age in 
2
federally funded programs and activities. Half a cen-
3
tury after their passage, still more needs to be done 
4
to ensure that students enjoy protections consistent 
5
with the spirit, intent, and promise of these 
6
groundbreaking civil rights laws. 
7
(2) Schools are still failing to take necessary 
8
steps to prevent harassment on the basis of sex, 
9
race, national origin, color, and disability and pro-
10
vide survivors of sexual assault and other forms of 
11
harassment—especially women and girls, students of 
12
color, LGBTQI+ students, and students with dis-
13
abilities—the support and services they need to feel 
14
safe and learn in school, denying them equal edu-
15
cational opportunities. 
16
(3) As the Supreme Court has held in Franklin 
17
v. Gwinnett County Public Schools, 503 U.S. 60 
18
(1992), and Davis v. Monroe County Board of Edu-
19
cation, 526 U.S. 629 (1999), covered entities are re-
20
sponsible for preventing and addressing harassment 
21
on the basis of sex in their education programs and 
22
activities under title IX. Following this principle, 
23
courts have similarly required funding recipients to 
24
address harassment based on race, color, national 
25

origin, and disability in their education programs 
1
and activities. 
2
(4) Perpetrators of harassment based on sex, 
3
race, color, national origin, or disability at school are 
4
not limited to students, nor are the victims of such 
5
harassment. Incidents have also involved faculty, ad-
6
ministrators, coaches, volunteers, other staff mem-
7
bers, and visitors. 
8
(5) Sexual harassment of students, especially of 
9
women and girls, students of color, students with 
10
disabilities, and LGBTQI+ students, is widely prev-
11
alent in K–12 and higher education. For example— 
12
(A) 1 in 5 girls ages 14 through 18 have 
13
been kissed or touched without their consent, 
14
58 percent of LGBTQI+ youth ages 13 
15
through 21 have been sexually harassed, and 
16
disabled children are 2.9 times more likely than 
17
their peers to be sexually assaulted; 
18
(B) women and girls of color are more like-
19
ly to experience sexual harassment in school 
20
than their White peers; and 
21
(C) in college— 
22
(i) more than 1 in 4 women, more 
23
than 1 in 15 men, and nearly 1 in 4 
24
transgender, nonbinary, and gender-non-
25
04:35 Dec 08, 2022
H9387

•HR 9387 IH
conforming students are sexually assaulted 
1
during their time as undergraduates; 
2
(ii) 1 in 7 women, 1 in 10 men, and 
3
1 in 5 transgender, nonbinary, and gender- 
4
nonconforming students experience dating 
5
violence or domestic violence as under-
6
graduates; and 
7
(iii) 1 in 10 women, 1 in 33 men, and 
8
1 in 7 transgender, nonbinary, and gender- 
9
nonconforming students experience stalk-
10
ing as undergraduates. 
11
(6) Students also experience forms of sex-based 
12
harassment beyond sexual harassment, such as har-
13
assment based on sexual orientation, gender identity, 
14
sex characteristics (including intersex status), preg-
15
nancy, childbirth, medical conditions related to preg-
16
nancy or childbirth, and sex stereotypes. 
17
(A) For example, according to one study, 
18
86.3 percent of LGBTQI+ students experi-
19
enced harassment or assault based on personal 
20
characteristics, 77.6 percent reported avoiding 
21
school functions, and 71.8 percent reported 
22
avoiding extracurricular activities because they 
23
felt unsafe or uncomfortable. 
24

•HR 9387 IH
(B) According to another study, 64 percent 
1
of girls who were pregnant or parenting re-
2
ported not feeling safe at school as a barrier to 
3
attending school compared to 32 percent of 
4
girls overall. 
5
(7) Like sex-based harassment, harassment 
6
based on race, color, national origin, and disability 
7
remains a problem at educational institutions. 
8
(A) Between 2011 and 2016, the National 
9
Center for Education Statistics documented a 
10
40-percent increase in college campus hate inci-
11
dents. According to the Bureau of Justice Sta-
12
tistics, racial bias is the most common motiva-
13
tion behind these hate incidents. 
14
(B) The Centers for Disease Control and 
15
Prevention has agreed that racism has a pro-
16
found and negative impact on the mental and 
17
physical health of people of color. As such, rac-
18
ist incidents can take a serious toll on students’ 
19
overall health and well-being, even affecting 
20
their academic performance. A 2021 UCLA 
21
study found that young adults who experience 
22
discrimination are at higher risk for both short 
23
and long-term behavioral and mental health 
24
04:35 Dec 08, 2022
H9387
7 
•HR 9387 IH
problems that are exacerbated with each inci-
1
dent. 
2
(C) According to the Department of Jus-
3
tice, the rate of violence victimization against 
4
persons with disabilities is nearly 4 times the 
5
rate for nondisabled persons. Nearly 1⁄3 of chil-
6
dren and adolescents with disabilities have ex-
7
perienced violence. Corporal punishment is al-
8
most twice as high in schools with a higher pro-
9
portion of students with disabilities receiving 
10
special education services as in other schools. 
11
Girls with disabilities are also at higher risk of 
12
sexual violence perpetrated by their peers than 
13
nondisabled girls. 
14
(8) The Government Accountability Office esti-
15
mated that about 1 in 4 students aged 12–18 saw 
16
hate words or symbols written at schools in 2014– 
17
2015, 2016–2017, and 2018–2019. 
18
(9) Students also often experience intersectional 
19
forms of harassment that, for example, may include 
20
sexual harassment that is racialized or harassment 
21
based on having a disability and being transgender, 
22
among other types of intersectional harassment. 
23
(10) Few students report harassment to their 
24
schools, often because of shame or self-blame, fear 
25
04:03 Dec 09, 2022
H9387
8 
•HR 9387 IH
of retaliation, fear of being ignored or disciplined, 
1
fear of police or immigration officials, or lack of 
2
knowledge of services schools can offer to help. In 
3
particular, women and girls of color, women and 
4
girls with disabilities, pregnant and parenting stu-
5
dents, and LGBTQI+ students are too often dis-
6
believed and met with unsupportive responses, in-
7
cluding retaliation, after reporting sexual harass-
8
ment because of stereotypes that label them as less 
9
credible. Men and boys, too, are often disbelieved or 
10
dismissed when they report sexual harassment. 
11
(11) Failure of a school to comply with title IX, 
12
title VI, and section 504 may limit or deny the abil-
13
ity of students, employees, and others to participate 
14
in or benefit from the school’s education programs 
15
or activities leading to discrimination by creating a 
16
hostile learning environment that impedes edu-
17
cational attainment, damages rights to equal edu-
18
cational opportunities, and undermines learning for 
19
all. 
20
(12) When schools fail to protect student vic-
21
tims of harassment, including by failing to offer sup-
22
portive measures that are designed to preserve and 
23
restore the educational opportunities of the victim, 
24
students often suffer in the form of emotional dis-
25
04:35 Dec 08, 2022
H9387
9 
•HR 9387 IH
tress, mental health consequences, lower academic 
1
achievement, lost scholarships and financial aid, 
2
poor school attendance, and decreased school com-
3
pletion rates. Moreover, many schools may respond 
4
negatively to harassment by creating additional trau-
5
ma and harm for the student victim (often by, for 
6
example, blaming the student for their victimization 
7
or by refusing to help them), which is also known as 
8
‘‘institutional betrayal’’. Harm may also be caused 
9
by the Title IX coordinators having a conflict of in-
10
terest, such as serving within school leadership or 
11
local educational agency leadership (including serv-
12
ing as a principal, vice principal, headmaster, super-
13
intendent, board member, general counsel, athletics 
14
director, coach, or dean of students, or on a judicial 
15
hearing board or in a position to whom an appeal 
16
might be made). 
17
(13) The language of title IX is broad and 
18
sweeping, making clear that the intent of Congress 
19
is to provide avenues of redress for opening the 
20
courthouse doors to victims of a wide range of sex 
21
discrimination in schools. However, since the pas-
22
sage of title IX, courts have created barriers that 
23
make it extraordinarily difficult for survivors to ob-
24
tain redress from schools through private litigation. 
25
04:35 Dec 08, 2022
H9387
10 
•HR 9387 IH
(14) In a 5 to 4 opinion in Gebser v. Lago 
1
Vista Independent School District, 524 U.S. 274 
2
(1998), the Supreme Court held that students sub-
3
jected to sex-based harassment by their teachers 
4
may receive a damages remedy in private litigation 
5
under title IX only when school officials with ‘‘au-
6
thority to institute correct measures’’ on the recipi-
7
ent’s behalf have ‘‘actual notice’’ of the harassment 
8
and are ‘‘deliberately indifferent’’, or respond in a 
9
clearly unreasonable manner, to it. A year later, in 
10
Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education, 526 
11
U.S. 629 (1999), the Supreme Court held that in 
12
order to receive money damages under title IX, stu-
13
dents who experience sex-based harassment by their 
14
peers, must additionally show that the harassment is 
15
‘‘so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that 
16
it can be said to deprive the victims of access to the 
17
educational opportunities or benefits provided by the 
18
school.’’ Courts have applied the same standards in 
19
requiring funding recipients to address harassment 
20
based on race, color, national origin, or disability. 
21
(15) In contrast, in the workplace, under title 
22
VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 
23
2000e et seq.) (referred to in this section as ‘‘title 
24
VII’’), a plaintiff experiencing harassment based on 
25
04:35 Dec 08, 2022
H9387
11 
•HR 9387 IH
sex, race, color, national origin, or religion by a co-
1
worker or other non-supervisor need only show their 
2
employer reacted negligently in response to severe or 
3
pervasive harassment of which the employer knew or 
4
should have known. And sometimes—such as when 
5
a supervisor fires someone because they refuse to 
6
submit to sexual advances—title VII automatically 
7
holds an employer liable. 
8
(16) Although they do not affect the relevant 
9
standards for individuals to obtain injunctive and 
10
equitable relief for harassment on the basis of race, 
11
color, sex, national origin, age, or disability under 
12
covered programs and activities, the Supreme 
13
Court’s decisions in Gebser v. Lago Vista Inde-
14
pendent School District and Davis v. Monroe County 
15
Board of Education and lower court opinions se-
16
verely limit the availability of remedies for such indi-
17
viduals by imposing more stringent standards for re-
18
covery of damages. Yet in many cases, damages are 
19
the only remedy that would effectively rectify past 
20
harassment. Further, in 2022, in Cummings v. Pre-
21
mier Rehab Keller PLLC, 142 S. Ct. 1562 (2022), 
22
the Supreme Court limited the ability of plaintiffs 
23
bringing disability discrimination claims under the 
24
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public 
25
04:35 Dec 08, 2022
H9387
12 
•HR 9387 IH
Law 111–148) and section 504 to recover emotional 
1
distress damages, which are often the sole or pri-
2
mary remedy for survivors of harassment. The dis-
3
senting Justices in Cummings warned that this rul-
4
ing upset Congressional intent and longstanding 
5
precedent under these and other statues, suggesting 
6
the possibility that its logic might be extended in the 
7
future to other laws such as title IX and title VI. 
8
Some lower courts have added additional onerous 
9
barriers, such as one under which a school is liable 
10
for its failure to address known sexual harassment 
11
only if the victim later experiences further sexual 
12
harassment as a result of this failure. 
13
(17) These limitations thwart the purpose of 
14
Congress to protect students from harassment and 
15
ensure non-discriminatory educational environments. 
16
They create prohibitively high standards for the law-
17
suits of students regarding harassment based on sex, 
18
race, color, national origin, and disability under title 
19
IX, title VI, and section 504 that are more onerous 
20
than those applicable to workplace harassment law-
21
suits under title VII. As a result, schools may do 
22
less to address harassment against their students 
23
than to address the same harassment of their em-
24
ployees. This means that students, who are often 
25
04:35 Dec 08, 2022
H9387
13 
•HR 9387 IH
children and young adults, must suffer worse har-
1
assment than adult employees before they are enti-
2
tled to a remedy in court. 
3
(18) Gebser v. Lago Vista Independent School 
4
District, Davis v. Monroe County Board of Edu-
5
cation, and subsequent opinions create an incentive 
6
for covered entities to insulate themselves from 
7
knowledge of harassment rather than adopting and 
8
enforcing practices that will minimize the danger of 
9
such harassment. These opinions thus undermine 
10
the purpose of prohibitions on discrimination in the 
11
civil rights laws, which is to induce covered pro-
12
grams or activities to adopt and enforce practices 
13
that will minimize the danger that vulnerable stu-
14
dents or other persons will be exposed to such odious 
15
behavior. 
16
(19) Current title IX regulations issued by the 
17
Department of Education in 2020 entitled ‘‘Non-
18
discrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education 
19
Programs or Activities Receiving Federal Financial 
20
Assistance’’ (part 106 of title 34, Code of Federal 
21
Regulations), have made it more difficult for student 
22
survivors to report harassment to schools and receive 
23
help, including by, for example, only allowing schools 
24
to respond to title IX complaints of sexual harass-
25
04:35 Dec 08, 2022
H9387
14 
•HR 9387 IH
ment that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively of-
1
fensive that it effectively denies a person equal ac-
2
cess to a school program or activity—meaning stu-
3
dents will have to endure repeated and escalating 
4
levels of harassment before their complaint can even 
5
be investigated. These regulations also pose uniquely 
6
burdensome procedures for cases of sexual harass-
7
ment that are not required for any other type of stu-
8
dent or staff misconduct, further sweeping sexual vi-
9
olence under the rug. 
10
(20) Department of Education guidance ex-
11
plains the requirement under title VI and section 
12
504 for institutions to respond to harassment based 
13
on disability, race, color, or national origin that is 
14
sufficiently serious to deny or limit the ability of a 
15
student to participate in or benefit from the edu-
16
cation programs and activities of the recipient. 
17
(21) Schools with affirming and welcoming en-
18
vironments that provide support and protection 
19
against all forms of harassment and discrimination 
20
ensure that students have better social, behavioral, 
21
academic, and mental health outcomes. 
22
(22) Legislative action is necessary and appro-
23
priate to restore the access to the courts that was 
24
sharply limited by Gebser v. Lago Vista Independent 
25

School District, Davis v. Monroe County Board of

Education, Cummings v. Premier Rehab, and other 
2
court opinions, restore the availability of a full range 
3
of remedies for harassment based on sex, race, color, 
4
national origin, disability, or age, and prevent dis-
5
criminatory harassment in schools. Any action needs 
6
to take into full account the intersectionality of inci-
7
dents of harassment in educational programs or ac-
8
tivities. Sex-based violence and harassment often 
9
harms those populations already most vulnerable at 
10
education institutions. 
11
(23) In landmark rulings in Price Waterhouse 
12
v. Hopkins 490 U.S. 228 (1989) and Bostock v. 
13
Clayton County, Ga. (2020), the Supreme Court cor-
14
rectly interpreted title VII to hold that discrimina-
15
tion on the basis of sex stereotypes, sexual orienta-
16
tion, or gender identity necessarily constitute dis-
17
crimination ‘‘because of sex’’. To date, Federal 
18
courts of appeal have held uniformly that these hold-
19
ings apply equally to title IX. Legislative action is 
20
necessary and appropriate to codify these established 
21
interpretations of title IX law and ensure support 
22
and protection for LGBTQI+ students against se-
23
vere and widespread discriminatory harassment.

(24) Discrimination by State and local govern-
1
ments on the basis of sex, race, color, national ori-
2
gin, age, or disability in education programs and ac-
3
tivities receiving Federal financial assistance violates 
4
the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment 
5
to the Constitution of the United States. In many 
6
circumstances, such discrimination also violates 
7
other constitutional rights such as those of liberty 
8
and privacy under the Due Process Clause of the 
9
14th Amendment. Congress may validly invoke its 
10
powers under the 14th Amendment to provide a full 
11
range of remedies in response to discrimination by 
12
both private and government actors. 
13
(25) In enacting the protections of the amend-

(A) ensure that students and other persons
