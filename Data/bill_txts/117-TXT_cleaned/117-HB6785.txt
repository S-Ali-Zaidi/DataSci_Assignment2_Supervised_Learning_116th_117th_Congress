SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
1
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that— 
2
(1) North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena 
3
glacialis) are critically endangered, with fewer than 
4
340 remaining at the time of the introduction of this 
5
Act; 
6
(2) historically, the North Atlantic right whale 
7
population was decimated by the whaling industry, 
8
although the whale population received protections 
9
from such industry in the 1930s; 
10
(3) despite a modest recovery prior to 2010, the 
11
North Atlantic right whale is one of the most endan-
12
gered whales in the world and has experienced a sig-
13
nificant decline since 2010; 
14
(4) the North Atlantic right whale has been 
15
listed as an endangered species under the Endan-
16
gered Species Conservation Act of 1969 (Public Law 
17
89–669; 80 Stat. 926) and its successor the Endan-
18
gered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) 
19
since 1970 and is designated as depleted under the 
20
Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 
21
1361 et seq.); 
22
(5) because North Atlantic right whales are 
23
long-lived and highly migratory, and at present rates 
24
females give birth to a single calf only once every 5 
25
to 10 years, they are highly vulnerable to the im-
26
04:48 Mar 01, 2022
H6785
3 
•HR 6785 IH
pacts of human activity and habitat degradation, 
1
with female whales and calves particularly vulnerable 
2
to vessel strikes; 
3
(6) North Atlantic right whales frequently cross 
4
paths with high vessel traffic areas and fishing 
5
grounds, leaving the whales particularly vulnerable 
6
to vessel collisions and fishing gear entanglements, 
7
the leading causes of injury and death to the species; 
8
(7) even when North Atlantic right whales do 
9
not die as a result of fishing gear entanglement or 
10
vessel strike, those whales can still experience sig-
11
nificant sub-lethal effects such as chronic stress and 
12
reproductive failure; 
13
(8) this ongoing decline due to human impacts 
14
resulted in a further 30 percent decline in the popu-
15
lation between 2019 and 2020 resulting in the low-
16
est population estimate in the past 2 decades; 
17
(9) based on the current rate of mortality of 
18
North Atlantic right whales, and because of the 
19
small number of breeding females in the population 
20
and low birth rates, recent analysis suggests the spe-
21
cies will lose its ability to recover in merely a few 
22
decades if human-caused mortality is not reduced 
23
immediately;

•HR 6785 IH
(10) under the Marine Mammal Protection Act 
1
of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq.), United States 
2
fishermen in certain locations have been required to 
3
modify their fishing gear and behavior to minimize 
4
the likelihood of entanglements, including by using 
5
sinking groundlines, having weak links in buoy lines, 
6
using multiple traps per buoy, appropriately mark-
7
ing fishing gear, and complying with seasonal area- 
8
specific closures in North Atlantic right whale habi-
9
tats; 
10
(11) vessels in United States waters that are 65 
11
feet or more in length have been required to comply 
12
with a seasonal 10-knot speed limit in certain loca-
13
tions to reduce the threat of vessel collisions; and 
14
(12) ongoing mortalities, driven in part by 
15
shifts in North Atlantic right whale distribution 
16
caused by climate change, indicate that additional 
17
actions are necessary to reverse this species’ popu-

lation decline.

(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
20
gress that— 
21
(1) the Governments of the United States and 
22
Canada must work together to reduce lethal and 
23
sub-lethal effects of human activities on North At-
24
lantic right whales; and

(2) effectively addressing the threats to the

long-term viability of the North Atlantic right 
2
whales will require a joint commitment and effort 
3
from government entities, local communities, marine 
4
scientists and conservationists, fishermen, owners

of North Atlantic right whales by supporting North
