A BILL 
To provide for a coordinated Federal program to accelerate 
plastics waste reduction and support recycling research 
and development for the economic and national security 
of the United States, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Plastic Waste Reduc-
4
tion and Recycling Research Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress makes the following findings:

•HR 2821 IH
(1) It is estimated that global production of 
1
plastic has increased from 2,000,000 tons of plastic 
2
per year in 1950 to 400,000,000 tons per year 
3
today, and of the 8.3 billion metric tons of plastic 
4
ever produced globally, 6.3 billion metric tons has 
5
become plastic waste. 
6
(2) The United States has failed to invest in 
7
the development of domestic recycling markets, tech-
8
nology and materials to make the recycling process 
9
more available and efficient, and as a result, the 
10
United States recycles only 9 percent of its plastic 
11
waste. 
12
(3) For more than 2 decades, the United States 
13
and other developed nations sold and exported 
14
106,000,000 metric tons of recyclable plastics to 
15
China, but in 2018 China issued a ban on contami-
16
nated United States plastics. 
17
(4) Following the 2018 China ban, more and 
18
more United States communities are sending recy-
19
clable items to landfills or incinerators. 
20
(5) As recycling programs have moved toward 
21
single-stream curbside recycling, more recyclable 
22
items are mixed with non-recyclable items, resulting 
23
in fewer potentially recyclable items actually being 
24
recycled and turned into new, valuable products. 
25

•HR 2821 IH
(6) The resin identification coding system in 
1
use today has not been substantially updated since 
2
its creation in 1988. 
3
(7) Characterizing the type and recyclability of 
4
different types of plastics in use today requires up-
5
dated standards. 
6
(8) Separating and processing the many dif-
7
ferent types of plastics as well as the heterogenous 
8
materials containing multiple layers of different 
9
plastic types commonly in use today will require new 
10
sorting and recycling technologies. 
11
(9) There are currently limited private or public 
12
investments in research and development to improve 
13
plastic waste reduction, recycling technologies, or 
14
other technologies and processes to reduce the 
15
amount and impact of plastic waste. 
16
(10) The Federal Government can play an im-
17
portant role in supporting research and development 
18
and facilitating standards, tools, and technologies 
19
needed across the different stages of the plastics 
20
production and recycling ecosystem.
