District and Chicago, whose astonishing life and con-
tributions have a lasting influence.

State of Arkansas for his accomplishments in the pub-
lishing industry in spite of tremendous challenges for Af-

slaves and rose to international acclaim as owner and 
publishing icon of Chicago’s Johnson Publishing Com-
pany, publisher of Ebony and Jet magazine, in the 7th 
Congressional District of Illinois; 
Whereas Johnson was born into poverty, and he lost his fa-
ther at a young age to a sawmill accident and was forced 
to start working; 
Whereas Johnson’s mother remarried James Williams, who 
became an important figure in Johnson’s life; 
Whereas Arkansas City had no opportunities for education 
beyond the eighth grade for African Americans, and 
schools were overcrowded and segregated; 
Whereas these were difficult times for African Americans in 
rural Arkansas, and Johnson’s passion to overcome dis-
advantages and for learning laid the foundation for his 
eventual rise as the founder of the largest African-Amer-
ican publishing company in the world; 
Whereas after a trip to Chicago to attend the World’s Fair, 
the Johnson family realized opportunities for African 
Americans were far greater in the North than they had 
experienced in the South, and they stayed in Chicago; 
Whereas Johnson was more determined than ever to excel, 
and even though he was teased by his classmates at 
DuSable High School on the South Side of Chicago for 
his ragged clothes and Southern manner, he was empow-
ered by the knowledge of the existence of an African- 
American middle class, something he had never experi-
enced; 
Whereas Johnson excelled at DuSable High School, was elect-
ed class president, and graduated in 1936;
