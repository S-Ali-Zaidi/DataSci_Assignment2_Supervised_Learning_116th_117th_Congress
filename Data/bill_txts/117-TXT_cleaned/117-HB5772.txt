Congress makes the following findings: 
2
(1) Historical epidemiological perspectives sug-
3
gest an association between exposure to general res-
4
piratory viruses and subsequent neurological and 
5
psychiatric illnesses. 
6
(2) Early research suggests that one in three 
7
patients diagnosed with a COVID–19 infection expe-
8
riences a neurological or psychiatric illness within six 
9
months of such diagnosis. 
10
(3) Research is urgently needed to better un-
11
derstand why neurological and psychiatric illnesses 
12
occur in patients following a COVID–19 infection, so 
13
that treatments and therapeutic strategies can be 
14
developed. 
15
(4) The National Science Foundation and the 
16
National Institutes of Health have a deep history of 
17
supporting collaborative research that spans the bio-
18
logical sciences and paves the way for health-related
