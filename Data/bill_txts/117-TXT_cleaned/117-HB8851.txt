SEC. 10. PREGNANT STUDENTS’ RIGHTS, ACCOMMODA-
15
TIONS, AND RESOURCES. 
16
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
17
(1) Female students who are enrolled at institu-
18
tions of higher education and experiencing un-
19
planned pregnancies may face pressure that their 
20
only option is to receive an abortion or risk academic 
21
failure. 
22
(2) 27.6 percent of all abortions in the United 
23
States are performed on women of college age, be-
24
tween the ages of 20 and 24, according to a 2019 
25

H8851
38 
•HR 8851 IH
report by the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
1
vention. 
2
(3) A significant proportion of abortions in the 
3
United States are performed on women of college 
4
age who may be unaware of their rights under title 
5
IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (20 
6
U.S.C. 1681 et seq.) or deprived of an alternative to 
7
receiving an abortion. 
8
(4) Additionally, women on college campuses 
9
may fear institutional reprisal, loss of athletic schol-
10
arship, and possible negative impact on academic op-
11
portunities. 
12
(5) An academic disparity exists because of the 
13
lack of resources, support, and notifications available 
14
for female college students who do not wish to re-
15
ceive an abortion or who carry their unborn babies 
16
to term.
