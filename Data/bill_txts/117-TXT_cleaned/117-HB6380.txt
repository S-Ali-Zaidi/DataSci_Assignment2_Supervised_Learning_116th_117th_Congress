A BILL 
To direct the Secretary of Education to establish a grant 
program to make grants to the parents of students en-
rolled in elementary schools or secondary schools that, 
for any reason related to COVID–19, are failing to pro-
vide in-person instruction for each enrolled student for 
each school day of school year 2021–2022, and for other 
purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Open Schools Act’’. 
2
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
3
Congress finds the following: 
4
(1) Parents are best equipped to make decisions 
5
for their children, including the educational setting 
6
that will best serve the interests and educational 
7
needs of their child. 
8
(2) After more than 2 years of the COVID–19 
9
pandemic, it is now known that pandemic-related 
10
school closures deprive children of the equalizing 
11
force of education. The pandemic is widening edu-
12
cational inequality and the learning gaps created by 
13
these shutdowns will only get even worse if they con-
14
tinue. 
15
(3) Peer interactions are a crucial ingredient to 
16
academic success. A Yale University study has found 
17
that the inability to be with friends and peers from 
18
different socioeconomic groups did more damage to 
19
children’s educational progress than any other factor 
20
and underscored the importance of having kids from 
21
across the socioeconomic spectrum learning together. 
22
(4) When schools close, parents are often asked 
23
to facilitate the learning of children at home and can 
24
struggle to perform this task. This is especially true 
25
for parents with limited resources which can be ex-
26

acerbated even more for rural families without ac-
1
cess to broadband. 
2
(5) Despite what the mainstream media says 
3
about most parents across America working from 
4
home, that simply is not the case. In fact, the vast 
5
majority of parents do not have the work from home 
6
luxury many so-called experts would have you be-
7
lieve. This has further divided the United States be-
8
tween regular, hard-working parents and a new 
9
‘‘laptop class’’ that only works remotely. These 
10
working-class parents do not have the ability to help 
11
their children learn when their school switches to re-
12
mote learning, even if only for a few days at a time. 
13
(6) Crucial benchmarks like achievement tests 
14
and high stakes examinations that determine admis-
15
sion or advancement to new education levels and in-
16
stitutions, are thrown into disarray when schools 
17
close. Strategies to postpone, skip, or administer ex-
18
aminations at a distance raise serious concerns 
19
about fairness, especially when access to learning be-
20
comes variable. Disruptions to assessments results in 
21
stress for students and their families and often trig-
22
ger disengagement. 
23
(7) Youth may be uniquely susceptible to nega-
24
tive mental health outcomes if they are experiencing 
25
16:10 Jan 14, 2022
H6380
4 
•HR 6380 IH
pandemic-related disruptions to in-person schooling 
1
in intersection with other adverse circumstances, 
2
such as racism, poverty, food insecurity, or home in-
3
stability. Loss of access to school-based mental 
4
health care may be of heightened importance for 
5
youth from low-income families, as they are most 
6
likely to receive mental health services solely from 
7
their school. 
8
(8) Online learning is no substitute for class-
9
room instruction. Nationally, on average, teachers 
10
say they’re working 2 fewer hours per day than 
11
when they were in their classrooms. And they esti-
12
mate that their students are spending half as much 
13
time learning, 3 hours a day, as they were before the 
14
coronavirus pandemic. 
15
(9) Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Chicago 
16
public schools leadership insist schools are safe and 
17
have called the refusal of the Chicago Teachers 
18
Union to work in-person a strike and an illegal work 
19
action. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki has 
20
confirmed schools are safe for students, including in 
21
Chicago. More than 300,000 public school students 
22
in Chicago were off in January after the district 
23
canceled classes when the Chicago Teachers Union 
24
voted to refuse orders to work in-person. ‘‘Our 
25
16:10 Jan 14, 2022
H6380
5 
•HR 6380 IH
schools are safe’’, Chicago public schools CEO Pedro 
1
Martinez said during a press conference on January 
2
4, 2022, after the results of the vote were an-
3
nounced. ‘‘There is no evidence that our schools 
4
have ever been unsafe this school year.’’. He added 
5
that Chicago schools rarely saw evidence of any 
6
major transmission. 
7
(10) Instead of pouring money into schools that 
8
are failing to stay open for full, in-person learning, 
9
the United States must instead use these taxpayer 
10
dollars to support children, not the teacher’s unions, 
11
and allow parents to make decisions about their 
12
child’s educational future. The United States should 
13
provide eligible parents the ability to elect to educate 
14
their child in an alternate manner, apart from their 
15
local public school that has closed for in-person 
16
learning.
