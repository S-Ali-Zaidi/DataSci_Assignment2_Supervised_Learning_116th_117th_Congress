SEC. 101. FINDINGS. 
9
Congress finds the following: 
10
(1) In its 2020 report to Congress, the bipar-
11
tisan United States-China Economic and Security 
12
Review Commission issued the following key find-
13
ings: 
14
(A) As Beijing strategically opens its fi-
15
nancial sector to secure foreign capital and 
16
global investment indices shift asset allocations 
17
toward Chinese securities, United States inves-
18
tors’ exposure to the unique and significant

•HR 5286 IH
risks accumulated in China’s capital markets 
1
rises. These risks center around the opacity of 
2
China’s financial system and Beijing’s inter-
3
ference in market activity to advance its polit-
4
ical objectives. 
5
(B) Increased financial exposure to China 
6
threatens to undermine the efforts of the 
7
United States to defend against China’s unfair 
8
economic practices and protect the policy inter-
9
ests of the United States. Several Chinese com-
10
panies included in global investment indices are 
11
subject to United States export controls but not 
12
investment restrictions. This mismatch enables 
13
problematic Chinese companies to continue rais-
14
ing United States capital and reduces the 
15
strength with which the United States can de-
16
fend against companies that threaten national 
17
security. 
18
(C) Beijing continues to deny United 
19
States audit regulators full visibility into the fi-
20
nancials of U.S.-listed Chinese companies in 
21
line with United States accounting standards. 
22
These evasions from effective regulation and 
23
oversight, together with United States-listed 
24
Chinese companies’ complex ownership struc-

tures, deprive United States investors of both 
1
full transparency and the opportunity for legal 
2
redress in cases of accounting fraud, eroding 
3
the integrity of United States capital markets. 
4
(2) The Chinese Communist Party’s commit-
5
ment to their Military-Civil Fusion development 
6
strategy, which supports the modernization goals of 
7
the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) by ensuring its 
8
access to advanced technologies and expertise ac-
9
quired and developed by even those Chinese compa-
10
nies, universities, and research programs that ap-
11
pear to be civilian entities, remains a grave threat 
12
to the national security of the United States. 
13
(3) The efforts of the Government of the 
14
United States to stymie China’s utilization of United 
15
States capital markets is an ongoing, multi-agency, 
16
and decades-long effort. The colloquially titled Sec-
17
tion 1237 List of the Strom Thurmond National De-
18
fense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999, as 
19
well as the Section 1260H List of the William M. 
20
(Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization 
21
Act for Fiscal Year 2021, both highlight companies 
22
who pose a serious threat to the national security of 
23
the United States.

(4) On June 3, 2021, the Department of De-
1
fense released a list of 47 entities identified as Chi-
2
nese military companies operating in the United 
3
States in accordance with section 1260H of the Wil-
4
liam M. (‘‘Mac’’) Thornberry National Defense Au-
5
thorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (Public Law 
6
116–283). 
7
(5) On January 14, 2021, the Department of 
8
Defense released the names of additional ‘‘Com-
9
munist Chinese military companies’’ operating di-
10
rectly or indirectly in the United States in accord-
11
ance with the statutory requirement of section 1237 
12
of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal 
13
Year 1999. Those companies included: Advanced 
14
Micro-Fabrication 
Equipment 
Inc. 
(AMEC), 
15
Luokung Technology Corp. (LKCO), Xiaomi Cor-
16
poration, Beijing Zhongguancun Development In-
17

18
Grand China Air Co. Ltd. (GCAC), Global Tone 
19
Communication Technology Co. Ltd. (GTCOM), 
20
China National Aviation Holding Co. Ltd. (CNAH), 
21
and Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, Ltd. 
22

24
trict Court for the District of Columbia issued an

•HR 5286 IH
order in Xiaomi Corporation v. Department of De-
1
fense (Case No. 1:21–cv–00280–RC) that forestalled 
2
the Defense Department’s designation of the Xiaomi 
3
Corporation as a Communist Chinese military com-
4
pany. On May 6, 2021, the Nasdaq-listed Luokung 
5
Technology Corporation became the second China- 
6
based company to avoid sanctions imposed under 
7
Executive Order 13959. These companies have been 
8
able to avoid sanctions because the Chinese Com-
9
munist Party actively blocks United States Govern-
10
ment agencies from obtaining information relevant 
11
to determining the ownership and control of China- 
12
based enterprises. 
13
(7) Several Chinese military or military related 
14
companies, as well as surveillance and technology 
15
companies, including Hikvision, a major manufac-
16
turer of video surveillance equipment, materially 
17
contribute to either the ongoing genocide in Xinjiang 
18
or to other gross violations of internationally recog-
19
nized human rights across the People’s Republic of 
20
China (PRC). 
21
(8) On January 19, 2021, then-Secretary of 
22
State Michael R. Pompeo determined that the Chi-
23
nese Communist Party (CCP) has committed geno-
24
cide against the predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and 
25
00:05 Oct 02, 2021
H5286
7 
•HR 5286 IH
other ethnic and religious minority groups in 
1
Xinjiang. 
2
(9) Then-Secretary Pompeo’s designation cited 
3
the State Department’s exhaustive documentation of 
4
CCP human rights abuses in Xinjiang, indicating 
5
that ‘‘since at least March 2017, local authorities 
6
dramatically escalated their decades-long campaign 
7
of repression against Uyghur Muslims and members 
8
of other ethnic and religious minority groups, includ-
9
ing ethnic Kazakhs and ethnic Kyrgyz’’. 
10
(10) The genocide determination also cited the 
11
CCP’s regular dehumanization of the Uyghur people 
12
in Xinjiang, including by labeling them as ‘‘malig-
13
nant tumors’’, citing the Islamic faith as a ‘‘commu-
14
nicable plague’’, and justifying the grotesque treat-
15
ment of the Uyghur people in stark, unsettling 
16
terms: ‘‘you can’t uproot all the weeds hidden among 
17
the crops in the field one-by-one; you need to spray 
18
chemicals to kill them all’’. 
19
(11) On April 21, 2021, the United States 
20
House Committee on Foreign Affairs approved with-
21
out objection H.R. 1155, which affirmed that the 
22
PRC, since 2017, has arbitrarily detained as many 
23
as 1.8 million Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and mem-
24
bers of other Muslim minority groups in a system of 
25
00:05 Oct 02, 2021
H5286

•HR 5286 IH
extrajudicial mass internment camps, in addition to 
1
arbitrarily detaining many in formal prisons and de-
2
tention centers, and has subjected detainees to 
3
forced labor, torture, political indoctrination, and 
4
other severe human rights abuses. 
5
(12) The State Department’s January 2021 
6
genocide designation further cited the forced steri-
7
lization of Uyghur and other minority women, with 
8
the purpose of eliminating the minority population 
9
in Xinjiang. 
10
(13) Media reporting has documented wide-
11
spread and systemic efforts by PRC authorities to 
12
force Uyghur women to take contraceptives or to 
13
subject them to sterilization or abortion, threatening 
14
to detain those who do not comply. 
15
(14) In many detention facilities and labor 
16
camps across the PRC, Falun Gong prisoners of 
17
conscience have at times comprised the majority of 
18
the population, and have been said to receive the 
19
longest sentences and the worst treatment, including 
20
torture. 
21
(15) The persecution and killing of religious 
22
and political prisoners for any purpose, including for 
23
the purpose of selling their organs for transplant, is 
24
00:05 Oct 02, 2021

•HR 5286 IH
an egregious and intolerable violation of the funda-
1
mental right to life. 
2
(16) On November 18, 2020, the United States 
3
House of Representatives approved without objection 
4
H. Res. 697, which ‘‘affirms the cultural and reli-
5
gious significance of the goal of genuine autonomy 
6
for the people of Tibet and the deep bond between 
7
the American and Tibetan people’’. 
8
(17) The Foreign Relations Authorization Act, 
9
Fiscal Years 1992 and 1993 established, with re-
10
spect to Tibet, the following sense of Congress: ‘‘It 
11
is the policy of the United States to oppose aggres-
12
sion and other illegal uses of force by one country 
13
against the sovereignty of another as a manner of 
14
acquiring territory, and to condemn violations of 
15
international law, including the illegal occupation of 
16
one country by another.’’. 
17
(18) Protecting United States capital markets 
18
against PRC-based companies that support the 
19
PLA’s modernization efforts or else aid and abet 
20
grotesque and barbaric violations of internationally 
21
recognized human rights is a national security im-
22
perative. 
23
(19) As argued by the Uyghur Human Rights 
24
Project: ‘‘[It is] still legal for shareholders to make

profits from ownership of these complicit Chinese 
1
companies, some of which are publicly traded, in-
2
cluding through ‘emerging markets’ indexes. It is 
3
time for much more serious action: no U.S. persons 
4
should be permitted to hold the stocks and bonds of 
5
the Chinese companies that are under U.S. human 
6
rights sanctions.’’.
