RESOLUTION 
Maintaining North Korea’s seizure of the vessel USS Pueblo 
and its detention of the crew were in violation of inter-
national law and seeking the return of the USS Pueblo 
to the United States. 
Whereas the USS Pueblo is a commissioned ship of the 
United States Navy captured by North Korea on January 
23, 1968; 
Whereas the USS Pueblo carried three 50-caliber machine 
guns and were not fired when the USS Pueblo was being 
seized by North Korean patrol boats and engaged in no 
hostilities against anyone, including North Korea; 
Whereas the United States has made clear that the USS 
Pueblo was on an intelligence collection mission in the 
Sea of Japan at the time of its seizure by North Korea;

•HRES 53 IH 
Whereas intelligence collection by vessels of this type is a 
standard and accepted practice in the world today; 
Whereas the USS Pueblo was engaged in a mission that is 
accepted by the navies and governments of the world; 
Whereas the USS Pueblo had strict orders to remain at all 
times at a distance more than 13 nautical miles from the 
nearest point in North Korean territory, in order to avoid 
any possible incident. The United States has no reason 
to believe the orders were not obeyed; 
Whereas even in the case of a warship that has entered terri-
torial waters, the coastal state is not entitled to assert 
any jurisdiction over it other than to require the warship 
to leave the territorial sea if the warship does not comply 
with regulations of the coastal state concerning passage 
through the territorial sea and disregards a request for 
compliance; 
Whereas the United States contends international law gives 
no such right to seize a foreign war vessel within the ter-
ritorial waters of North Korea; and 
Whereas all evidence shows that the USS Pueblo was on the 
high seas: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) maintains North Korea’s seizure of the ves-
2
sel USS Pueblo and its detention of the crew were 
3
in violation of international law; and 
4
(2) declares that USS Pueblo is the property of 
5
the United States Government and it should be re-
6
turned to the United States.
