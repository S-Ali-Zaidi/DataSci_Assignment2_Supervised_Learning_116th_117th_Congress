RESOLUTION 
Celebrating the centennial of United States Navy aircraft 
carriers. 
Whereas, 100 years ago, on March 20, 1922, following a 2- 
year conversion at Norfolk Naval Yard, the former USS 
Jupiter (AC–3) was recommissioned as the United States 
Navy’s first aircraft carrier, USS Langley (CV–1); 
Whereas the Langley began as an experimental platform, lay-
ing the foundation for the future shipboard operations of 
aircraft; 
Whereas, in fleet exercises beginning in 1924, the ship, ap-
propriately nicknamed the ‘‘Covered Wagon’’, played a 
pioneering role in demonstrating the potential of the air-
craft carrier as an invaluable weapons system that would 
transform how the United States Navy fought at sea;

Whereas, for the past 100 years, aircraft carriers have been 
the Navy’s preeminent power projection platform and 
have furthered the Nation’s interest in times of war and 
peace; 
Whereas, from the great naval battles in the Pacific during 
World War II, to strike and close air support missions 
in the battlegrounds of Korea and Vietnam, to the execu-
tion of Joint Force operations over the sands of the Mid-
dle East, and to present-day deterrence in numerous lo-
cations around the world, aircraft carriers have proven 
time and again that they provide an invaluable capability 
in support of the strategic goals of the United States; 
Whereas with an unequaled ability to provide warfighting ca-
pabilities across the full spectrum of conflict and to adapt 
in the face of ever-changing threats, aircraft carriers, 
their embarked air wings, and associated strike groups 
are the foundation of United States maritime strategy; 
Whereas aircraft carriers enable the United States Armed 
Forces to carry out operations from international waters, 
often obviating the need to obtain fly-over and land-based 
rights from other nations; 
Whereas Nimitz and Ford class aircraft carriers are modern, 
mobile United States military bases complete with air-
field, hospital, and hardened communications systems 
from which the United States can strike at its enemies, 
from wherever and whenever it chooses; 
Whereas there are more than 2,450 companies in 48 States 
and over 364 congressional districts, and more than 
13,100 Americans, who proudly contribute to the con-
struction and maintenance of these complex and techno-
logically advanced ships; and
