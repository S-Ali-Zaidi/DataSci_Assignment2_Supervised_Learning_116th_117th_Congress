A BILL 
To amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to clarify that dis-
parate impacts on certain populations constitute a suffi-
cient basis for rights of action under such Act, and 
for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 9219 IH
(1) This Act is made necessary by a decision of 
1
the Supreme Court in Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 
2
U.S. 275 (2001) that significantly impairs statutory 
3
protections against discrimination that Congress has 
4
erected over a period of almost 4 decades. The 
5
Sandoval decision undermines these statutory pro-
6
tections by stripping victims of discrimination (de-
7
fined under regulations that Congress required Fed-
8
eral departments and agencies to promulgate to im-
9
plement title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 
10
U.S.C. 2000d et seq.)) of the right to bring action 
11
in Federal court to redress the discrimination. 
12
(2) The Sandoval decision contradicts settled 
13
expectations created by title VI of the Civil Rights 
14
Act of 1964, title IX of the Education Amendments 
15
of 1972 (also known as the ‘‘Patsy Takemoto Mink 
16
Equal Opportunity in Education Act’’) (20 U.S.C. 
17
1681 et seq.), the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 
18
(42 U.S.C. 6101 et seq.), and section 504 of the Re-
19
habilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) (collec-
20
tively referred to in this Act as the ‘‘covered civil 
21
rights provisions’’). The covered civil rights provi-
22
sions were designed to establish and make effective 
23
the rights of persons to be free from discrimination 
24
on the part of entities that are subject to 1 or more

•HR 9219 IH
of the covered civil rights provisions, as appropriate 
1
(referred to in this Act as ‘‘covered entities’’). In 
2
1964 Congress adopted title VI of the Civil Rights 
3
Act of 1964 to ensure that Federal dollars would not 
4
be used to subsidize or support programs or activi-
5
ties that discriminated on racial, color, or national 
6
origin grounds. In the years that followed, Congress 
7
extended these protections by enacting laws barring 
8
discrimination in federally funded education activi-
9
ties on the basis of sex in title IX of the Education 
10
Amendments of 1972, and discrimination in feder-
11
ally funded activities on the basis of age in the Age 
12
Discrimination Act of 1975 and disability in section 
13
504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. 
14
(3) All of the statutes cited in this section were 
15
designed to protect persons subject to discrimina-
16
tion. As Congress has consistently recognized, effec-
17
tive enforcement of the statutes and protection of 
18
the rights guaranteed under the statutes depend 
19
heavily on the efforts of private attorneys general. 
20
Congress acknowledged that it could not secure com-
21
pliance solely through administrative efforts and en-
22
forcement actions initiated by the Attorney General.

(4) The Supreme Court has made it clear that 
1
individuals suffering discrimination under these stat-
2
utes have a private right of action in the Federal 
3
courts, and that this is necessary for effective pro-
4
tection of the law, although Congress did not make 
5
such a right of action explicit in the statute involved. 
6
Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677 
7
(1979). 
8
(5) Furthermore, for effective enforcement of 
9
the statutes cited in this section, it is necessary that 
10
the private right of action include a means to chal-
11
lenge all forms of discrimination that are prohibited 
12
by the statutes, including practices that have a dis-
13
parate impact and are not justified as necessary to 
14
achieve the legitimate goals of programs or activities 
15
supported by Federal financial assistance. 
16
(6) By reinstating a private right of action to 
17
challenge disparate impact discrimination under title 
18
VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d 
19
et seq.) and confirming that right for other civil 
20
rights statutes, Congress is not acting in a manner 
21
that would expose covered entities to unfair findings 
22
of discrimination. The legal standard for a disparate 
23
impact claim has never been structured so that a 
24
23:23 Dec 06, 2022
H9219
5 
•HR 9219 IH
finding of discrimination could be based on numer-
1
ical imbalance alone. 
2
(7) In contrast, a failure to reinstate or confirm 
3
a private right of action would leave vindication of 
4
the rights to equality of opportunity solely to Fed-
5
eral agencies. Action by Congress to specify a pri-
6
vate right of action is necessary to ensure that per-
7
sons will have a remedy if they are denied equal ac-
8
cess to education, housing, health, environmental 
9
protection, transportation, and many other programs 
10
and services by practices of covered entities that re-
11
sult in discrimination. 
12
(8) As a result of the Supreme Court’s decision 
13
in Sandoval, courts have dismissed numerous claims 
14
brought under the regulations promulgated pursuant 
15
to title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 
16
U.S.C. 2000d et seq.) that challenged actions with 
17
an unjustified discriminatory effect. Although the 
18
Sandoval Court did not address title IX of the Edu-
19
cation Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. 1681 et 
20
seq.), lower courts have similarly dismissed claims 
21
under such title. 
22
(9) Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 
23
1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) has received different treat-
24
ment by the Supreme Court. In Alexander v. Choate, 
25
23:23 Dec 06, 2022
H9219
6 
•HR 9219 IH
469 U.S. 287 (1985), the Court proceeded on the 
1
assumption that the statute itself prohibited some 
2
actions that had a disparate impact on disabled indi-
3
viduals—an assumption borne out by congressional 
4
statements made during passage of the Act. In 
5
Sandoval, the Court appeared to accept this prin-
6
ciple of Alexander. Moreover, the Supreme Court ex-
7
plicitly recognized congressional approval of the reg-
8
ulations promulgated to implement section 504 of 
9
the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 in Consolidated Rail 
10
Corp. v. Darrone, 465 U.S. 624, 634 (1984). Rely-
11
ing on the validity of the regulations, Congress in-
12
corporated the regulations into the statutory require-
13
ments of section 204 of the Americans with Disabil-
14
ities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12134). Nonetheless, 
15
Sandoval creates the potential for uncertainty in the 
16
application of critical protections of Section 504, 
17
particularly in the lower courts. 
18
(10) The right to maintain a private right of 
19
action under a provision added to a statute under 
20
this Act will be effectuated by a waiver of sovereign 
21
immunity in the same manner as sovereign immu-
22
nity is waived under the remaining provisions of that 
23
statute.

•HR 9219 IH
(11) Numerous provisions of Federal law ex-
1
pressly prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex, 
2
and Federal agencies and courts have correctly in-
3
terpreted these prohibitions on sex discrimination to 
4
include discrimination based on sexual orientation, 
5
gender identity, and sex stereotypes. In particular, 
6
the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission 
7
correctly interpreted title VII of the Civil Rights Act 
8
of 1964 in Macy v. Holder, Baldwin v. Foxx, and 
9
Lusardi v. McHugh. 
10
(12) In forbidding discrimination based on sex, 
11
Congress intended to strike at the entire spectrum 
12
of disparate treatment resulting from sex-related 
13
characteristics. The Supreme Court correctly recog-
14
nized in Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins and Oncale v. 
15
Sundowner Offshore Services that among these char-
16
acteristics are sex-stereotypes, including masculinity 
17
and femininity. Congress reaffirmed in the Preg-
18
nancy Discrimination Act of 1978 that discrimina-
19
tion on the basis of ‘‘sex’’ includes but is not limited 
20
to discrimination on the basis of ‘‘pregnancy, child-
21
birth, or related medical conditions.’’. 
22
(13) The absence of explicit prohibitions of dis-
23
crimination on the basis of sexual orientation and 
24
gender identity under Federal statutory law has cre-

ated uncertainty for employers and other entities 
1
covered by Federal nondiscrimination laws and 
2
caused unnecessary hardships for LGBTQ individ-
3
uals. 
4
(14) The Supreme Court correctly recognized in 
5
Hobby Lobby v. Burwell that the Religious Freedom 
6
Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA) ‘‘provides no . . . 
7
shield’’ to those who ‘‘cloak’’ discrimination as ‘‘reli-
8
gious practice to escape legal sanction.’’ This Act re-
9
affirms that crucial limitation on RFRA, that Con-
10
gress did not intend for it to be used—and indeed 
11
it cannot be used—to provide a defense against alle-
12
gations of discrimination on the basis of any pro-
13
tected trait. 
14
(15) Chapter 1 of title 9, United States Code 
15
(commonly known as the ‘‘Federal Arbitration 
16
Act’’), represented an exercise of legislative power 
17
that required courts to recognize private voluntary 
18
agreements to arbitrate commercial disputes at a 
19
time when the courts were refusing to do so on 
20
grounds that arbitration represented a usurpation of 
21
the authority of the courts to resolve legal disputes. 
22
(16) The Federal Arbitration Act did not, and 
23
should not have been interpreted to, supplant or nul-
24
lify the legislatively created rights and remedies that 
25
23:23 Dec 06, 2022
H9219

•HR 9219 IH
Congress, exercising its power under article I of the 
1
Constitution of the United States, has granted to 
2
the people of the United States for resolving dis-
3
putes in State and Federal courts. 
4
(17) Recent court decisions, including AT&T 
5
Mobility LLC v. Concepcion, 563 U.S. 333 (2011) 
6
and American Express Co. v. Italian Colors Res-
7
taurant, 133 S. Ct. 2304 (2013), have interpreted 
8
the Federal Arbitration Act to broadly preempt 
9
rights and remedies established under substantive 
10
State and Federal law. As a result, these decisions 
11
have enabled business entities to avoid or nullify 
12
legal duties created by congressional enactment, re-
13
sulting in millions of people in the United States 
14
being unable to vindicate their rights in State and 
15
Federal courts. 
16
(18) States have a compelling interest in enact-
17
ing rights and remedies to protect the welfare of 
18
their citizens, and the Federal Arbitration Act 
19
should not be, and should not have been, interpreted 
20
to preempt State legislation that enacted rights and 
21
remedies to protect the welfare of their citizens. 
22
(19) The Supreme Court misinterpreted title 
23
VII of the Civil Rights Act in establishing the 
24
Faragher-Ellerth affirmative defense in Faragher v. 
25
23:23 Dec 06, 2022
H9219
10 
•HR 9219 IH
City of Boca Raton and Burlington Industries, Inc. 
1
v. Ellerth. This affirmative defense often leaves vic-
2
tims of sexual harassment with no remedy or re-
3
course after incidence of sexual or other harassment. 
4
Violations of the law, and injuries to a victim and 
5
their rights, are not cured by the existence of an 
6
anti-harassment policy or the lack of future harm, 
7
and in a hostile work environment taking preventa-
8
tive measures is not a requirement that falls on the 
9
victim. 
10
(20) Bringing a lawsuit to vindicate civil rights 
11
is financially risky, and law firms, whether large or 
12
small, are unlikely to take such cases on. Congress 
13
enacted the Civil Rights Attorney’s Fees Award Act 
14
of 1976 in order to make lawsuits to vindicate civil 
15
rights more accessible to potential plaintiffs. The 
16
Supreme Court correctly recognized in City of River-
17
side v. Rivera that the effectuation of congressional 
18
intent requires viable civil rights lawsuits, which are 
19
dependent on the availability of private enforcement 
20
mechanisms and the corresponding availability of at-
21
torney’s fees. 
22
(21) However, the Supreme Court incorrectly 
23
held that the ‘‘catalyst theory’’ is not a permissible 
24
basis for the award of attorney’s fees in Buckhannon 
25
23:23 Dec 06, 2022
H9219
11 
•HR 9219 IH
v. West Virginia Department of Health & Human 
1
Resources. In doing so, the Court deprived plaintiffs 
2
who effectively win a lawsuit through a settlement, 
3
from receiving pre-trial attorney’s fees. Congress en-
4
acted fee-shifting provisions in civil rights laws to 
5
encourage private enforcement of those laws, and 
6
fees must be awarded when a lawsuit vindicates the 
7
rights Congress sought to secure. In disapproving of 
8
the ‘‘catalyst theory’’ the Court incentivized poten-
9
tial defendants to draw out the pre-trial process and 
10
settle at the last second, making the lawsuit too ex-
11
pensive for the average victim to undertake and too 
12
risky for the average attorney to accept a civil rights 
13
case. 
14
(22) The Civil Rights Act of 1964, and other 
15
civil rights laws that followed it, were written, in 
16
part, to banish rampant disparate treatment on the 
17
basis of race from American society. Congress 
18
sought to overcome the pervasive, racist ideology 
19
that Black traits were inferior by prohibiting dis-
20
crimination, and intended the Act to be interpreted 
21
broadly—encompassing race and all its attributes, 
22
especially those traits historically associated with 
23
race. 
24
23:23 Dec 06, 2022
H9219
12 
•HR 9219 IH
(23) ‘‘Blackness’’ and its associated physical 
1
traits, such as dark skin and kinky and curly hair, 
2
have too often been equated with inferiority and 
3
‘‘unprofessionalism.’’ Professionalism was, and still 
4
is, closely linked to European features and manner-
5
isms, which entails that those who do not naturally 
6
fall into Eurocentric norms must alter their appear-
7
ances, sometimes drastically and permanently, in 
8
order to be deemed professional. Such norms are, on 
9
their face, proxies for race. 
10
(24) Federal courts have correctly interpreted, 
11
e.g. that title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 
12
prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, and 
13
thus protect individuals from discrimination against 
14
afros. However, the courts have yet to accept that 
15
the Act outlaws dress codes and grooming policies 
16
that prohibit any natural presentation of Black hair, 
17
including afros, braids, twists, and locks. Although 
18
purportedly ‘‘race-neutral’’, these policies have a dis-
19
parate impact on Black individuals as they are more 
20
likely to deter, burden, or punish Black individuals 
21
than any other group. Therefore, hair discrimination 
22
targeting hairstyles associated with race is racial dis-
23
crimination.
