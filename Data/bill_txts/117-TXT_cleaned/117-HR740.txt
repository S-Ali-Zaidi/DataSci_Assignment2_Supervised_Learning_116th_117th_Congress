RESOLUTION 
Recognizing October 2021 as Liver Cancer Awareness 
Month. 
Whereas liver cancers, and risk factors causing such diseases, 
have become urgent problems of global proportion; 
Whereas in the United States, liver cancer is the fastest- 
growing cause of cancer-related death and is among the 
leading causes of cancer-related deaths; 
Whereas in the United States, the Division of Cancer Control 
and Population Sciences of the National Cancer Institute 
estimated that there will be 42,230 new liver cancer diag-
noses in the year 2021, and approximately 30,200 will 
die from the disease; 
Whereas liver cancer cases are projected to increase 35 per-
cent in the United States;

Whereas, on average, between 20 to 30 percent of individuals 
with chronic hepatitis B infection, 4 percent of individ-
uals with hepatitis C, 20 percent of individuals with hep-
atitis C-cirrhosis, between 4 to 27 percent of individuals 
with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and between 10 to 15 
percent of individuals with alcohol-related cirrhosis will 
develop liver cancer; 
Whereas American Indian and Alaska Natives are more than 
twice as likely to develop liver cancer when compared to 
non-Hispanic Whites; 
Whereas American Indian, Alaska Native, Hispanic, Native 
American Pacific Islander and Black men and women are 
at greater risk of developing liver cancer as compared to 
the White (Hispanic and non-Hispanic) population; 
Whereas among the Native American Pacific Islander popu-
lation, the higher rate of liver cancer is partially ex-
plained by higher incidence rates of hepatitis B and dia-
betes, which are comorbidities shown to increase the risk 
of developing liver cancer in an individual; 
Whereas the largest increase of liver cancer rates by 2030 is 
projected to be among African-American men and 
women; and 
Whereas the goals of ‘‘Liver Cancer Awareness Month’’ dur-
ing October 2021 are to— 
(1) highlight the global impact of liver cancer and 
the risk for all people with liver disease; 
(2) recognize that 70 percent of liver cancer cases 
could potentially be prevented and eliminated in part 
through a comprehensive public education and awareness 
campaign designed to identify those at risk for, and living 
with, liver cancer;

(3) inform patients about new treatments and clin-
ical trials that are available for liver cancer; and 
(4) help increase the length and quality of life for 
people diagnosed with liver cancer: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports broad access to treatments of and 
2
testing for the greatest risk factors for liver cancer, 
3
including the hepatitis B virus, the hepatitis C virus, 
4
nonalcoholic 
fatty 
liver 
disease, 
nonalcoholic 
5
steatohepatitis, alcohol-related cirrhosis, and other 
6
related liver conditions; 
7
(2) supports raising awareness of the risks and 
8
consequences of undiagnosed liver cancer, the impor-
9
tance of screening at-risk populations, and the value 
10
of diagnosing early; 
11
(3) calls for a robust governmental and public 
12
health response to protect the health of the approxi-
13
mately 45,000 people in the United States who cur-
14
rently have liver cancer; and 
15
(4) urges the Director of the Centers for Dis-
16
ease Control and Prevention to partner with State 
17
and local health departments to develop strategies to 
18
address risk factors for liver cancer and related liver 
19
diseases, including expanding access to hepatitis B 
20
vaccination, and access to available treatments of 
21
and testing for hepatitis C, nonalcoholic fatty liver
