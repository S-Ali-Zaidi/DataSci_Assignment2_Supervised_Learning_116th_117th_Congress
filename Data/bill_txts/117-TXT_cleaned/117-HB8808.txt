A BILL 
To acquire cobalt refining capacity in the United States, 
and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Cobalt Optimizes Bat-
4
teries And Leading Technologies Act of 2022’’ or the

‘‘COBALT Act of 2022’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress makes the following findings:

•HR 8808 IH
(1) The National Defense Stockpile lacks suffi-
1
cient cobalt reserves, falling from 13,000 tons dur-
2
ing the Cold War to only 333 tons today. 
3
(2) The United States currently produces zero 
4
newly refined cobalt, making the United States de-
5
pendent on foreign imports and secondary scrap ma-
6
terials for nearly 100 percent of its cobalt consump-
7
tion. 
8
(3) China is the world’s cobalt lynchpin, sup-
9
plying 72 percent of global refined cobalt. 
10
(4) The International Energy Agency forecasts 
11
a cobalt supply deficit by 2030, ultimately projecting 
12
cobalt demand in 2040 to range from 6 to 30 times 
13
higher than today’s levels. 
14
(5) Cobalt supply chains often face an 
15
untraceable mine-to-refinery chain of custody, risk-
16
ing inadvertent financing of slave and forced child 
17
labor. 
18
(6) Cobalt refineries generally use the process 
19
of 
hydrometallurgy 
(e.g., 
acid 
leaching) 
and 
20
pyrometallurgy (e.g., smelting), jeopardizing the en-
21
vironment.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
23
It is the sense of Congress that— 
24

H8808
3 
•HR 8808 IH
(1) the United States lack of cobalt refining ca-
1
pacity is a serious vulnerability to America’s critical 
2
mineral supply chains; 
3
(2) the People’s Republic of China’s dominant 
4
share of the refined cobalt market and the unprece-
5
dented global demand growth for refined cobalt are 
6
threats to the national security, economic stability, 
7
and competitiveness of key industries in the United 
8
States; and 
9
(3) the Department of Defense should— 
10
(A) make purchases and purchase commit-
11
ments with new refineries in the United States 
12
to encourage them to scale up production; 
13
(B) stockpile an increased amount of do-
14
mestically refined cobalt to decrease the vulner-
15
ability of the United States to supply chain 
16
interruptions; 
17
(C) require cobalt refineries in the United 
18
States to present a transparent mine-to-refinery 
19
chain of custody to curb accidental financing of 
20
slave and forced child labor; and 
21
(D) prioritize purchasing cobalt refined 
22
through the environmentally neutral process of 
23
chemical vapor metallurgy to prevent harm to 
24
the air, water, and soil.

SEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
1
It shall be the policy of the United States to— 
2
(1) support critical mineral refineries in the 
3
United States through purchases and purchase com-
4
mitments; 
5
(2) increase the amount of domestically refined 
6
critical minerals in the National Defense Stockpile; 
7
(3) decrease the dependence of the United 
8
States on critical minerals refined in foreign coun-
9
tries, including China; 
10
(4) combat slave and forced child labor in crit-
11
ical mineral mining and refining; and 
12
(5) protect the environment from harmful in-
13
dustrial practices related to critical mineral refining.

SEC. 5. PURCHASE PROGRAM FOR DOMESTICALLY RE-
15
FINED COBALT. 
16
(a) IN GENERAL.—The President, acting through 
17
Secretary of Defense and the Defense Logistics Agency, 
18
and in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, the Sec-
19
retary of Commerce, and the Secretary of the Interior, 
20
shall use the authorities provided under title III of the 
21
Defense Production Act of 1950 to increase the amount 
22
of domestically refined cobalt in the National Defense 
23
Stockpile by awarding eligible entities with purchases and 
24
purchase commitments of cobalt nanopowder and sub-

nanopowder refined in the United States through the envi-
1
ronmentally neutral process of chemical vapor metallurgy. 
2
(b) AMOUNT.—To carry out subsection (a), the Presi-
3
dent shall use $800,000,000 during fiscal year 2024 
4
through fiscal year 2028 from the Defense Production Act
