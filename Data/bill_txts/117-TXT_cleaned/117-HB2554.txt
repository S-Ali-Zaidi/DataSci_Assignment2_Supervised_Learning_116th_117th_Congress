A BILL 
To provide COVID–19 mitigation instructions for cruise 
ships, and other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Careful Resumption 
4
Under Improved Safety Enhancements Act’’ or the

‘‘CRUISE Act’’.

Congress makes the following findings:

•HR 2554 IH
(1) On March 14, 2020, in response to the 
1
COVID–19 pandemic, the Centers for Disease Con-
2
trol and Prevention (CDC) issued the ‘‘No Sail 
3
Order and Suspension of Further Embarkation’’ 
4
which prohibited all cruise ships with capacity to 
5
carry 250 or more individuals from embarking pas-
6
sengers in the United States. 
7
(2) Prior to the COVID–19 pandemic, the 
8
cruise industry supported nearly 450,000 American 
9
jobs and contributed over $55,500,000,000 to the 
10
United States economy annually. More than 300,000 
11
jobs have been lost in the United States due to the 
12
suspension of cruises. The majority of the individ-
13
uals impacted are independent business owners or 
14
individuals employed by small- to medium-sized busi-
15
nesses, including travel agents, taxi drivers, port em-
16
ployees, baggage handlers, and longshore workers, as 
17
well as airline, hotel, and restaurant employees. 
18
(3) On October 30, 2020, the CDC issued the 
19
‘‘Framework for Conditional Sailing Order’’ for 
20
cruise ships that laid out a 4-phase approach for the 
21
resumption of cruise activity. At that time, the CDC 
22
released technical instructions for only the first 
23
phase of this conditional sailing order. On April 2, 
24
2021, more than 5 months later, CDC released the 
25
04:27 Jun 08, 2021

•HR 2554 IH
technical instructions for half of the second phase. 
1
Without the complete technical instructions for all 4 
2
phases of this framework, no large cruise ships are 
3
able to resume operations in the United States 
4
under the CDC’s conditional sailing order. 
5
(4) The cruise industry is the only segment of 
6
the United States economy that is completely pro-
7
hibited from operations by the CDC due to COVID– 
8
19. For every other sector of the economy, CDC pro-
9
vides recommendations for how to mitigate the 
10
spread of COVID–19 without issuing orders to pro-
11
hibit operations. 
12
(5) Since July 2020, cruising has continued in 
13
Asia, Europe, and the South Pacific with nearly 
14
400,000 passengers sailing with health protocols to 
15
mitigate the spread of COVID–19. 
16
(6) The increasing availability of vaccines pro-
17
vides a path to the resumption of pre-pandemic ac-
18
tivities. On March 2, 2021, President Biden stated: 
19
‘‘We’re now on track to have enough vaccine supply 
20
for every adult in America by the end of May. . . . 
21
The more people who get vaccinated, the faster we’re 
22
going to overcome this virus and get back to our 
23
loved ones, get our economy back on track, and start 
24
to move back to normal.’’.

(7) As of March 11, 2021, 65 percent of people 
1
over the age of 65 and more than 70 percent of peo-
2
ple over the age of 75 in the United States were 
3
fully vaccinated against COVID–19, leading Presi-
4
dent Biden to state: ‘‘All adult Americans will be eli-
5
gible to get a vaccine no later than May 1. . . . 
6
After this long, hard year, that will make this Inde-
7
pendence Day something truly special, where we not 
8
only mark our independence as a nation but we 
9
begin to mark our independence from this virus.’’.
