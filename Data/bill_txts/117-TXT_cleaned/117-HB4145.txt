A BILL 
To establish a matched savings program for low-income 
students. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Earn To Learn Act’’. 
4
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
5
Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) Skyrocketing costs of higher education are 
7
outpacing available financial aid. Individuals in the 
8
United States owe more than $1,500,000,000,000 in 
9
student loan debt, and more than 3,000 student loan 
10

•HR 4145 IH
borrowers default on a student loan every day, many 
1
of whom left college before finishing a degree. 
2
(2) The cost of paying for public higher edu-
3
cation and workforce training programs continues to 
4
rise while the purchasing power of Federal Pell 
5
Grant aid has significantly diminished. 
6
(3) The confluence of these issues forces pro-
7
spective students to make the tough choice between 
8
foregoing postsecondary education and borrowing 
9
enough money to pay for college, an amount that is 
10
often many times their annual salary and can re-
11
main a financial burden for decades after these stu-
12
dents graduate. 
13
(4) The higher rates of loan delinquencies and 
14
default among low- and moderate-income popu-
15
lations often lead to increased financial hardship, 
16
fewer assets, and lower net worth. 
17
(5) In 2013, the Brookings Institute found that 
18
the increasing debt burden represents a drag on re-
19
cent graduates and also serves as a deterrent to 
20
would-be students who may question the trade-off 
21
between the debt burden and the payoff of a college 
22
degree. 
23
(6) During the academic year 2015–2016 the 
24
Department of Education found that nearly 3 in 4 
25
03:45 Jul 10, 2021
H4145
3 
•HR 4145 IH
students experience unmet need, and that unmet 
1
need among college students has risen by 23 percent 
2
since academic year 2011–2012. 
3
(7) The Federal Reserve System has deter-
4
mined student loan payments are displacing retire-
5
ment savings, home ownership, small business devel-
6
opment, and other forms of building wealth. 
7
(8) The Economic Well-Being of U.S. House-
8
holds in 2018 report by the Federal Reserve found 
9
that two-thirds of graduates with a bachelor’s degree 
10
or higher feel that their educational investment paid 
11
off financially, but only 3 in 10 students who started 
12
higher education programs but did not complete a 
13
degree share this view. 
14
(9) The United States urgently needs a new na-
15
tional, innovative approach to financial aid to help 
16
low-income students achieve their educational goals, 
17
graduate with affordable amounts of student loan 
18
debt, and improve their financial capability. 
19
SEC. 3. PURPOSES.

dents need to attain their educational goals;
