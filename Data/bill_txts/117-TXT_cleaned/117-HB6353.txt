•HR 6353 IH
(1) the National Service Animals Monument 
1
Corporation’s mission is to honor and recognize the 
2
broad scope of service animals, including working 
3
animals, through the creation of a memorial to edu-
4
cate the public of the contributions by service ani-
5
mals and the human-animal bond between service 
6
animals and their handlers, whether a person with 
7
a disability, a law enforcement officer, military per-
8
sonnel, or other handler; 
9
(2) formalized service animal work began in 
10
1929 when the Eustice School in New Jersey estab-
11
lished the first guide-dog school; 
12
(3) the purple poppy is the international symbol 
13
for the service and sacrifice of service animals; 
14
(4) on February 24 of each year, National 
15
Service Animals Day is celebrated in the United 
16
States and throughout the world; 
17
(5) service and working animals, such as dogs, 
18
horses, homing pigeons, donkeys, mules, dolphins, 
19
sea lions, and other animals, have worked alongside 
20
and supported humans throughout history and have 
21
created strong human-animal bonds, including— 
22
(A) during the Revolutionary War, horses 
23
served in combat carrying soldiers, as well as 
24
transporting the wounded and critical supplies;

(B) during World War I and World War

II— 
2
(i) homing pigeons served as critical 
3
messengers with tiny message capsules at-
4
tached to their legs that were used to send 
5
communications that saved the lives of 
6
countless soldiers, resulting in many pi-
7
geons becoming the target of enemy fire; 
8
and 
9
(ii) donkeys and mules transported 
10
food, 
supplies, 
and 
wounded 
11
servicemembers; and 
12
(C) during the war in Afghanistan— 
13
(i) military working dogs safeguarded 
14
the lives of thousands of servicemen by 
15
clearing areas of improvised explosion de-
16
vices; and 
17
(ii) in one example, Lucca, a German 
18
Shepherd-Belgian Malinois service dog, 
19
was employed by the United States Marine 
20
Corps for 6 years and trained to detect ex-
21
plosives, deploying twice to Iraq and once 
22
to Afghanistan, supporting over 400 mis-
23
sions without a single human fatality, and 
24
ultimately sustaining an injury and ampu-

tation in 2012 due to an improvised explo-
1
sive device while on patrol in Afghanistan; 
2
(6) the bonds formed between military per-
3
sonnel and law enforcement and their working dogs 
4
are so strong that they have risked their lives will-
5
ingly to save the other; 
6
(7) the tasks that service dogs perform for per-
7
sons with disabilities are essential activities of daily 
8
living, such as guiding people with visual impair-
9
ments, signaling sounds for those who are deaf, re-
10
trieving items for people with mobility issues, alert-
11
ing about impending cardiac episodes or seizures, 
12
turning on lights, providing stability for their owner 
13
while standing, and pressing elevator and accessi-
14
bility buttons; 
15
(8) in addition to service animals’ help with 
16
functional tasks and missions, the human-animal 
17
bond provides handlers the ability to live independ-
18
ently, work confidently, and socialize freely; 
19
(9) shelter dogs can be trained as service ani-
20
mals; 
21
(10) service animals, such as horses and dogs— 
22
(A) support a variety of health and ther-
23
apy services, including for people with autism,

schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, and bipolar

disorder; and 
2
(B) 
specifically, 
can 
support 
3
servicemembers and veterans who experience 
4
traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic 
5
stress disorder; 
6
(11) search and rescue dogs working with civil-
7
ian or law enforcement handlers make United States 
8
communities and the Nation safer when they assist 
9
with the rescue of lost children, seniors, and other 
10
at-risk individuals, including in the event of natural 
11
or manmade disasters, for example— 
12
(A) service animals have supported search 
13
and rescue missions after terrorist attacks, in-
14
cluding September 11 and the Oklahoma City 
15
bombing; and 
16
(B) service animals have supported local 
17
search and rescue missions involving lost chil-
18
dren, such as— 
19
(i) the service dog Mercy, a blood-
20
hound with the Lee County, Florida, Sher-
21
iff’s department, who tracked a 12-year-old 
22
girl for more than a half mile through 
23
thick woods after she went missing during 
24
Tropical Storm Elsa in July 2021; and

(ii) the service dog Gandalf, trained

by the South Carolina Search and Rescue 
2
Dog Association, who found a 12-year-old 
3
boy who had vanished from a campsite in 
4
the Blue Ridge Mountains in North Caro-
5
lina in March 2019; 
6
(12) the extraordinary abilities of service ani-
7
mals, including smell, sensing, hearing, eyesight, and 
8
empathy, make them uniquely capable of helping hu-
9
mans, including by assisting with the identification 
10
of illegal drugs, detecting an impending seizure, 
11
hearing a person buried beneath rubble, or seeing an 
12
expensive or vital tool dropped by a naval diver; 
13
(13) service animals provide well-documented 
14
value to human health, safety, and security; and 
15
(14) the National Service Animals Memorial 
16
will represent a place of pride, introspection, and 
17
education to pay tribute to the contributions and 
18
sacrifices made by all service animals and their han-
19
dlers throughout history.
