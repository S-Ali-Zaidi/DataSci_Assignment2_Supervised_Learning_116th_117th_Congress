SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Chiropractic Medicare 
2
Coverage Modernization Act of 2021’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS; STATEMENT OF PURPOSE. 
4
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) In 1972, coverage was established under the 
6
Medicare program for beneficiaries to receive chiro-
7
practic care. 
8
(2) Unfortunately, the antiquated statute re-
9
stricts beneficiaries to one service in a chiropractic 
10
clinic and Medicare chiropractic coverage has not 
11
kept up with private sector coverage and other fed-
12
eral health delivery systems. 
13
(3) Today, due to positive evidence-based out-
14
comes and cost effectiveness of the services provided 
15
by doctors of chiropractic, private coverage for chiro-
16
practic services has evolved and State licensure for 
17
chiropractors has advanced to meet patient needs 
18
and health outcomes. 
19
(4) This Act would bring Medicare chiropractic 
20
coverage more in line with that provided with the 
21
Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of De-
22
fense, the Federal Employee Health Benefits Pro-
23
gram, and private health insurance coverage. 
24
(b) PURPOSE.—It is the purpose of this Act to ex-
25
pand recognition and coverage of a doctor of chiropractic

4
by the State in which such doctor performs such function 
5
or action.
