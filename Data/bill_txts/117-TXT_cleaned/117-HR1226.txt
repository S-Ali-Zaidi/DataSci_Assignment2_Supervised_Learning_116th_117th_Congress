Whereas more research on Black maternal mental health out-
comes and care, existing State and other programs, and 
innovative maternity care models designed to reduce ra-
cial and ethnic disparities in maternal health outcomes is

mas and barriers to care, and provide insight on illness 
causation and the effects of maternal mental health con-
ditions on infants and communities;

duction in the maternal mortality rate and an increase in 
abstinence from illicit drugs and alcohol among pregnant 
women: Now, therefore, be it
