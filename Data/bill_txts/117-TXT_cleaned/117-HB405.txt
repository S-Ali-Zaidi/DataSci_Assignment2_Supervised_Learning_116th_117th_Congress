A BILL 
To require the Secretary of the Interior to prohibit the 
use of lead ammunition on United States Fish and Wild-
life Service lands, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Lead Endangers Ani-
4
mals Daily Act of 2021’’ or the ‘‘LEAD Act of 2021’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) In 1991, the United States Fish and Wild-
8
life Service required the use of nontoxic ammunition 
9
for all waterfowl hunting.

(2) Research has shown that the presence of 
1
lead in the environment poses a threat to human 
2
and wildlife health. 
3
(3) The Environmental Protection Agency has 
4
determined that lead is toxic to both humans and 
5
animals, and can negatively affect nearly every 
6
organ and system in the human body, including the 
7
heart, bones, intestines, kidneys, and reproductive 
8
and nervous systems. Lead exposure interferes with 
9
the development of the nervous system and is there-
10
fore particularly toxic to children, causing potentially 
11
permanent learning and behavioral disorders. 
12
(4) Lead is a potent neurotoxin, for which no 
13
safe exposure level exists for humans. The use of 
14
lead has been outlawed in and removed from paint, 
15
gasoline, children’s toys, and many other items to 
16
protect human health and wildlife. 
17
(5) Wildlife, including federally listed threat-
18
ened and endangered species, is at risk of lead toxi-
19
cosis through the ingestion of lead ammunition, ei-
20
ther directly by ingesting lead from spent ballistic 
21
materials while foraging, or indirectly by scavenging 
22
carcasses and viscera left by hunters. Lead may also 
23
pollute soil and water around outdoor shooting 
24
ranges.

(6) Lead ammunition also endangers human 
1
food supplies. Dairy and beef cattle have developed 
2
lead poisoning after feeding in areas where spent 
3
lead ammunition has accumulated. Spent lead am-
4
munition can also contaminate crops, vegetation, 
5
and waterways. 
6
(7) Humans are at risk of lead toxicosis 
7
through the consumption of game meat harvested 
8
with lead ammunition. 
9
(8) Alternatives to lead ammunition are readily 
10
available, and studies have shown that nonlead am-
11
munition performs just as well as lead-based ammu-
12
nition. 
13
(9) In January 2017, the outgoing Director of 
14
the United States Fish and Wildlife Service issued 
15
Director’s Order 219. In March 2017, the Principal 
16
Deputy Director of the United States Fish and 
17
Wildlife Service repealed this Order.
