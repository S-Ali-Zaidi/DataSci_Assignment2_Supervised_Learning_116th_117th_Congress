1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

7
(1) As a limit on governmental power, Constitu-
8
tional framers vested Federal powers in three co-

equal branches of government, each with unique and 
1
limited powers and each with a coequal duty to up-
2
hold and sustain the Constitution of the United 
3
States. 
4
(2) A Supreme Court justice stated, ‘‘The doc-
5
trine of the separation of powers was adopted by the 
6
convention of 1787 not to promote efficiency but to 
7
preclude the exercise of arbitrary power. The pur-
8
pose was not to avoid friction, but, by means of the 
9
inevitable friction incident to the distribution of the 
10
governmental powers among three departments, to 
11
save the people from autocracy.’’ Myers v. United 
12
States, 272 U.S. 52, 293 (1926) (Brandeis, J., dis-
13
senting). 
14
(3) James Madison, quoting Montesquieu, stat-
15
ed in Federalist 47, ‘‘There can be no liberty where 
16
the legislative and executive powers are united in the 
17
same person, or body of magistrates.’’. 
18
(4) Article I of the Constitution provides, ‘‘All 
19
legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in 
20
a Congress of the United States.’’. 
21
(5) A congressional committee print has noted 
22
that, ‘‘[b]ecause the President has no power or au-
23
thority over individual citizens and their rights ex-
24
cept where he is granted such power and authority

by a provision in the Constitution or by statute, the 
1
President’s proclamations are not legally binding 
2
and are at best hortatory unless based on such 
3
grants of authority.’’ 85th Cong., 1st Sess., Execu-
4
tive Orders and Proclamations: A Study of a Use of 
5
Presidential Powers (Comm. Print 1957). 
6
(6) The Supreme Court has stated that, even if 
7
Presidents have, without congressional authority, 
8
taken actions only the Congress may take, ‘‘Con-
9
gress has not thereby lost its exclusive constitutional 
10
authority to make laws necessary and proper to 
11
carry out the powers vested by the Constitution ‘in 
12
the Government of the United States, or any De-
13
partment of Officer thereof.’ ’’. (Youngstown Sheet & 
14
Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952)). 
15
(7) Treaties or Executive Agreements which 
16
purport to assign powers not amongst those specifi-
17
cally granted to the Federal Government by the 
18
Constitution are non-binding and cannot constitute 
19
law.
