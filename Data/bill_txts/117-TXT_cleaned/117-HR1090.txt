RESOLUTION 
Congratulating Ames Laboratory on 75 years of outstanding 
service. 
Whereas Ames Laboratory was established by the Atomic En-
ergy Commission on May 17, 1947, as a National Lab-
oratory; 
Whereas Ames Laboratory originated as the Ames Project at 
Iowa State College, later known as Iowa State University, 
which, under the leadership of Frank Spedding and Har-
ley Wilhelm, contributed valuable scientific and produc-
tion assistance to the Manhattan Project, including— 
(1) a unique method of purifying uranium metal; 
(2) substantial quantities of purified uranium metal 
to the first human-made self-sustaining nuclear chain re-
action; and

(3) 2,000,000 pounds of purified uranium in assist-
ance of the war efforts of the United States during World 
War II; 
Whereas Ames Laboratory (as the Ames Project at Iowa 
State College) was recognized on October 12, 1945, for 
its contributions to the defense of the United States dur-
ing World War II with the award of the Army-Navy ‘‘E’’ 
flag for Excellence in Production, the only educational in-
stitution to be so honored; 
Whereas the science and technology developments of Ames 
Laboratory have contributed to the advancement of 
human understanding and the benefit of society over 71⁄2 
decades, including— 
(1) the discovery, design, and mastery of rare earth 
and other materials that helped advance early progress of 
the Atomic Age; 
(2) globally recognized expertise in the properties of 
rare earth elements and their importance in technologies 
such as data-storage, wind power, lighting, and batteries; 
(3) the invention of lead-free solder, which removed 
toxic lead from electronic manufacturing processes; 
(4) the understanding of quasicrystals, including 
work by scientist Dan Shechtman, winner of the 2011 
Nobel Prize in Chemistry; 
(5) national and international leadership in critical 
materials important for United States manufacturing; 
(6) the development of analytical equipment to en-
able the mapping of the human genome; 
(7) the development of analytical instrumentation 
that can detect parts per trillion of atoms, molecules, and 
compounds;

(8) the discovery and development of catalysts lead-
ing to cost-effective biofuel production; 
(9) the development of metal and alloy powder syn-
thesis to accelerate the adoption of 3D printing and en-
able clean energy technologies; 
(10) the discovery of the first giant magnetocaloric 
material and demonstration of magnetic refrigeration; 
(11) the discovery of chemical processes to convert 
plastic waste into valuable resources; and 
(12) ground-breaking advances in the understanding 
of superconductors and topological semimetals; 
Whereas Ames Laboratory is the home of the Materials Prep-
aration Center, a research facility globally recognized for 
its unique capabilities in purification, preparation, and 
characterization of metals, alloys, and single crystals; 
Whereas Ames Laboratory is the home of the Critical Mate-
rials Institute, an Energy Innovation Hub that provides 
the United States with vital supply chain expertise in 
rare earth and other critical materials, including— 
(1) diversifying supplies of rare earth and other crit-
ical material resources; 
(2) developing substitutes for high-demand mate-
rials; and 
(3) driving recycling and reuse; 
Whereas Ames Laboratory is a leader in technology transfer, 
with 257 issued United States patents and licensed inno-
vations resulting in worldwide sales of more than 
$3,000,000,000 and returning royalty revenue of nearly 
$78,000,000; and 
Whereas Ames Laboratory has nurtured more than 2,500 
graduate students in its history, mentoring the scientific 
leaders and innovators of tomorrow through education
