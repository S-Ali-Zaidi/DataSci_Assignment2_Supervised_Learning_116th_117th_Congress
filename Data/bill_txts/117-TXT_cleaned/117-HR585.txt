RESOLUTION 
Condemning the atrocities and crimes against humanity 
being perpetrated against religious and ethnic minority 
women in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region by 
the Government of the People’s Republic of China. 
Whereas repression of ethnic Muslim minorities in the 
Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region has been ongoing, 
and was formalized with the ‘‘Strike Hard Campaign 
against Violent Terrorism’’ that began in 2014; 
Whereas the mass internment of Uyghur and other Muslim 
ethnic minorities in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous 
Region has been ongoing since April 2017; 
Whereas the People’s Republic of China has conducted a tar-
geted and systemic population-control campaign against

ethnic and religious minorities in the Xinjiang Uyghur 
Autonomous Region by imposing and implementing coer-
cive population-control practices including selectively en-
forcing birth quotas, targeting minority women who are 
in noncompliance with birth quotas, and subjecting 
women to coercive measures such as forced birth control, 
forced sterilization, and forced abortion; 
Whereas the most frequently cited internment reason for one 
majority-Uyghur county is a violation of birth control 
regulations; 
Whereas widespread reports indicate that detained Uyghurs, 
ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and other ethnic and religious 
minority women are subjected to sexual violence and pre-
vented from reproducing; 
Whereas, in August 2020, a first-hand account by a former 
teacher at a women’s internment camp in Urumqi re-
ported human rights abuses and atrocities against many 
of the 10,000 interned women, including inhumane and 
unsanitary conditions, forced injections of unknown sub-
stances, forced contraception, daily rape and sexual abuse 
by camp guards, and torture; 
Whereas the People’s Republic of China allocated $37 million 
for birth control surgeries in 2019 and 2020 and planned 
to force more than 80 percent of women in southern 
areas of Xinjiang to adopt ‘‘birth control measures with 
long-term effectiveness’’; 
Whereas sterilization rates in Xinjiang grew seven-fold from 
2016 to 2018 to more than 60,000 procedures; 
Whereas birthrates in the majority-Uyghur regions of Hotan 
and Kashgar decreased by more than 60 percent from 
2015 to 2018, and in 2019 the birthrate of the Uyghur

population plummeted by 24 percent, compared to a 4.2 
percent decline nationwide; 
Whereas the People’s Republic of China set a near-zero birth-
rate target of 1.05 per 1,000 people for one majority- 
Uyghur and Kazakh region for 2020, compared to 19.66 
per 1,000 in 2018; 
Whereas, in 2018, 80 percent of intrauterine device (IUD) 
insertions in China were performed in Xinjiang, which 
only makes up 1.8 percent of the nation’s population, up 
from only 2.5 percent in 2014; 
Whereas Chinese IUDs are designed without strings so that 
they can only be removed through surgical procedures by 
state-approved medical practitioners, and unauthorized 
removals are punished with prison sentences and fines; 
Whereas the People’s Republic of China’s policies incentivize 
interethnic marriages between ethnic minorities and Han 
that effectively assimilate minorities into the Han cul-
ture; 
Whereas the Pair Up and Become Family program sends 
male Han Chinese officials to live in and surveil Uyghur 
and other Muslim ethnic minorities’ homes, sometimes 
forcing Uyghur women to sleep alongside the Han offi-
cials sent to observe them; 
Whereas Xinjiang policies disrupt every facet of ethnic minor-
ity women’s lives beginning with sending young girls to 
Chinese boarding school, then pressuring marriage to 
Han Chinese men, pregnancy checks, and forced birth 
control or sterilization as a means of population control; 
Whereas the Programme of Action adopted at the Inter-
national Conference on Population and Development in 
1994 affirmed the right of individuals to make decisions

concerning reproduction free of all forms of discrimina-
tion, violence, or coercion, and reproductive coercion in-
cludes, but is not limited to, use of incentives or disincen-
tives to lower or raise fertility, withholding of information 
on reproductive health options, coerced or forced abor-
tion, involuntary sterilization or use of contraception, or 
forced pregnancy; 
Whereas, on October 6, 2020, 39 countries delivered a cross- 
regional joint statement to the United States Mission to 
the United Nations on the human rights abuses on 
Uyghurs and other minorities for forced birth control in-
cluding sterilization; 
Whereas, on January 19, 2021, the Department of State de-
termined that the People’s Republic of China committed 
crimes against humanity and genocide against Uyghurs 
and other ethnic and religious minority groups in 
Xinjiang, citing forced sterilizations, forced abortions, co-
erced marriages, and separation of Uyghur children from 
their families; 
Whereas the Department of State’s 2020 Country Reports on 
Human Rights Practices affirmed the genocide deter-
mination and noted coercive population control measures 
inflicted on ethnic and religious minority women in 
China, including forced injections with ‘‘drugs that cause 
temporary or permanent end to their menstrual cycles 
and fertility’’; and 
Whereas the United States ratified the United Nations Con-
vention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide 
in 1988, recognizing that ‘‘imposing measures intended 
to prevent births within the group’’ with intent to destroy 
a group in whole or part is an act that constitutes geno-
