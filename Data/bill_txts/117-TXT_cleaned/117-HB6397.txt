Congress finds the following:

•HR 6397 IH
(1) Access to high quality primary care is asso-
1
ciated with improved health outcomes and lower 
2
health care costs. 
3
(2) Substantial disparities exist in the distribu-
4
tion of primary care providers. 
5
(3) Shortages of health care providers affect 
6
Tribal, rural, and medically underserved commu-
7
nities more than the populations of more densely 
8
populated areas, resulting in such communities expe-
9
riencing significant health challenges and disparities. 
10
(4) American Indian, Alaskan Natives, and Na-
11
tive Hawaiians tend to have lower health status, 
12
lower life expectancy, and disproportionate disease 
13
burden when compared to other Americans. 
14
(5) Having training experiences in, living 
15
among, and being a member of Tribal, rural, and 
16
medically underserved communities increases cul-
17
tural awareness and can influence career choice for 
18
physicians to better serve such populations. 
19
(6) Research shows there is a relationship be-
20
tween the characteristics of a physician and the 
21
eventual practice location, including being part of an 
22
underrepresented minority or growing up in a rural 
23
area.
