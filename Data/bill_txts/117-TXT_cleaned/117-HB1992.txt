SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds that— 
4
(1) the industrial sector is integral to the econ-
5
omy of the United States— 
6
(A) providing millions of jobs and essential 
7
products; and 
8
(B) demonstrating global leadership in 
9
manufacturing and innovation; 
10
(2) carbon capture and storage technologies are 
11
necessary for reducing hard-to-abate emissions from 
12
the industrial sector, which emits nearly 25 percent 
13
of carbon dioxide emissions in the United States; 
14
(3) carbon removal and storage technologies, in-
15
cluding direct air capture, must be deployed at 
16
large-scale in the coming decades to remove carbon 
17
dioxide directly from the atmosphere;

(4) large-scale deployment of carbon capture, 
1
removal, utilization, transport, and storage— 
2
(A) is critical for achieving mid-century cli-
3
mate goals; and 
4
(B) will drive regional economic develop-
5
ment, technological innovation, and high-wage 
6
employment; 
7
(5) carbon capture, removal, and utilization 
8
technologies require a backbone system of shared 
9
carbon dioxide transport and storage infrastructure 
10
to enable large-scale deployment, realize economies 
11
of scale, and create an interconnected carbon man-
12
agement market; 
13
(6) carbon dioxide transport infrastructure and 
14
permanent geological storage are proven and safe 
15
technologies with existing Federal and State regu-
16
latory frameworks; 
17
(7) carbon dioxide transport and storage infra-
18
structure share similar barriers to deployment pre-
19
viously faced by other types of critical national infra-
20
structure, such as high capital costs and chicken- 
21
and-egg challenges, that require Federal and State 
22
support, in combination with private investment, to 
23
be overcome; and

(8) each State should take into consideration, 
1
with respect to new carbon dioxide transportation in-
2
frastructure— 
3
(A) qualifying the infrastructure as pollu-
4
tion control devices under applicable laws (in-
5
cluding regulations) of the State; and

(B) establishing a waiver of ad valorem 
7
and property taxes for the infrastructure for a
