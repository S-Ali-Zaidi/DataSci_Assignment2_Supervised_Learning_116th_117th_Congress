A BILL 
To support States in their work to end preventable morbidity 
and mortality in maternity care by using evidence-based 
quality improvement to protect the health of mothers 
during pregnancy, childbirth, and in the postpartum pe-
riod and to reduce neonatal and infant mortality, to 
eliminate racial disparities in maternal health outcomes, 
and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Maternal Care Access 
2
and Reducing Emergencies Act’’ or the ‘‘Maternal CARE 
3
Act’’. 
4
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
5
Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) In the United States, maternal mortality 
7
rates are among the highest in the developed world 
8
and increased by 26.6 percent between 2000 and 
9
2014. 
10
(2) Of the 4,000,000 American women who give 
11
birth each year, about 700 suffer fatal complications 
12
during pregnancy, while giving birth, or during the 
13
postpartum period, and an additional 50,000 are se-
14
verely injured. 
15
(3) It is estimated that about 60 percent of the 
16
maternal mortalities in the United States could be 
17
prevented and half of the maternal injuries in the 
18
United States could be reduced or eliminated with 
19
better care. 
20
(4) Data from the Centers for Disease Control 
21
and Prevention show that Black women are 3 to 4 
22
times more likely to die from pregnancy-related 
23
causes than White women. There are 42.8 deaths 
24
per 100,000 live births for Black women, compared 
25
to 13 deaths per 100,000 live births for White 
26
04:05 Jun 08, 2021
H2556

•HR 2556 IH
women and 17.2 deaths per 100,000 live births for 
1
women nationally. 
2
(5) Black women’s risk of maternal mortality 
3
has remained higher than White women’s risk for 
4
the past 6 decades. 
5
(6) Black women in the United States suffer 
6
from life-threatening pregnancy complications twice 
7
as often as their White counterparts. 
8
(7) High rates of maternal mortality among 
9
Black women span income and education levels, as 
10
well as socioeconomic status; moreover, risk factors 
11
such as a lack of access to prenatal care and phys-
12
ical health conditions do not fully explain the racial 
13
disparity in maternal mortality. 
14
(8) A growing body of evidence indicates that 
15
stress from racism and racial discrimination results 
16
in conditions—including hypertension and pre-ec-
17
lampsia—that contribute to poor maternal health 
18
outcomes among Black women. 
19
(9) Pervasive racial bias against Black women 
20
and unequal treatment of Black women exist in the 
21
health care system, often resulting in inadequate 
22
treatment for pain and dismissal of cultural norms 
23
with respect to health. A 2016 study by University 
24
of Virginia researchers found that White medical 
25

•HR 2556 IH
students and residents often believed biological 
1
myths about racial differences in patients, including 
2
that Black patients have less-sensitive nerve endings 
3
and thicker skin than their White counterparts. Pro-
4
viders, however, are not consistently required to un-
5
dergo implicit bias, cultural competency, or empathy 
6
training. 
7
(10) North Carolina has established a statewide 
8
Pregnancy Medical Home (PMH) program, which 
9
aims to reduce adverse maternal health outcomes 
10
and maternal deaths by incentivizing maternal 
11
health care providers to provide integral health care 
12
services to pregnant women and new mothers. Ac-
13
cording to the North Carolina Department of Health 
14
and Human Services Center for Health Statistics, 
15
the pregnancy-related mortality rate for Black 
16
women was approximately 5.1 times higher than 
17
that of White women in 2004. Almost a decade 
18
later, in 2013, the pregnancy-related mortality rates 
19
for Black women and White women were 24.3 and 
20
24.2 deaths per 100,000 live births, respectively. 
21
The PMH program has been credited with the con-
22
vergence in pregnancy-related mortality rates be-
23
