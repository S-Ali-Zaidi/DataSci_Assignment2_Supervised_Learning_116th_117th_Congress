•HR 9334 IH
(1) Quantum computing has the potential to 
1
spur advancements in molecular modeling and sim-
2
ulation that will benefit Americans. 
3
(2) Quantum molecular simulations and mod-
4
eling will enable scientists to study chemical ele-
5
ments and reactions with accuracy and speed that is 
6
far beyond the abilities of existing supercomputers. 
7
(3) Advances in molecular simulations and 
8
modeling would give researchers tools that could 
9
lead to breakthroughs across industries and sectors, 
10
including— 
11
(A) modeling the nitrogen fixation process 
12
utilized by bacteria, which could be used to de-
13
velop synthetic fertilizers without the high en-
14
ergy and material costs of current methods, cre-
15
ating the next generation of fertilizers; 
16
(B) creating more effective medications 
17
and reducing harmful interactions or side ef-
18
fects; 
19
(C) developing new materials to increase 
20
energy storage capacity and create more power-
21
ful battery technologies; 
22
(D) developing lighter, stronger metals;
