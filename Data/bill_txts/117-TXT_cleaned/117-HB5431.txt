To designate the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) as a 
transnational organized crime group. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Designating the Chi-
4
nese Communist Party as a Transnational Organized 
5
Crime Group Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
7
The Congress finds the following: 
8
(1) The 90,000,000 members of the Chinese 
9
Communist Party (referred in this Act as the 
10

•HR 5431 IH
‘‘CCP’’) are the sole ruling political party of the 
1
People’s Republic of China (PRC) under the direc-
2
tion of General Secretary Xi Jinping. 
3
(2) On June 30, 2020, in direct violation of the 
4
Sino-British Joint Declaration, the PRC passed a 
5
draconian national security law for Hong Kong that 
6
gives the ruling CCP sweeping new powers over the 
7
semi-autonomous city of Hong Kong. 
8
(3) The national security law allows mainland 
9
Chinese officials to operate in Hong Kong and gives 
10
Beijing the power to subjugate the people of Hong 
11
Kong to the dictums of the CCP. 
12
(4) The physical wellbeing of foreign nationals 
13
is at risk under the CCP’s new National Security 
14
Law. 
15
(5) In response to the CCP-led human rights 
16
violations of unjust abuse and detention perpetrated 
17
against the Uyghurs, Secretary of State Mike 
18
Pompeo announced on July 9, 2020, that the Trump 
19
administration would bar the entry of the following 
20
three prominent CCP officials into the United 
21
States— 
22
(A) Chen Quanguo, the Communist Par-
23
ty’s Secretary of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autono-

mous Region (XUAR) in Northwest China and 
1
a member of the Politburo; 
2
(B) Zhu Hailun, Party Secretary of the 
3
Xinjiang 
Political 
and 
Legal 
Committee 
4
(XPLC); and 
5
(C) Wang Mingshan, Party Secretary of 
6
the Xinjiang Public Security Bureau (XPSB). 
7
(6) On July 13, 2020, the Chinese Foreign 
8
Ministry imposed sanctions against four United 
9
States officials, including Senator Ted Cruz of 
10
Texas, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, Representa-
11
tive Chris Smith of New Jersey, and the Honorable 
12
Sam Brownback, United States Ambassador for 
13
International Religious Freedom, in retaliation to 
14
Mr. Pompeo’s July 9th announcement. 
15
(7) On September 22, 2020, the House of Rep-
16
resentatives passed H.R. 6210, the Uyghur Forced 
17
Labor Prevention Act, in a wide, bi-partisan man-
18
ner. 
19
(8) Despite China’s promise to confirm all 
20
forms of fentanyl as a class of drugs effective May 
21
1, 2019, the PRC remained the primary source of 
22
fentanyl trafficked into the United States in 2019, 
23
according to a 2020 DEA Intelligence Report.

(9) Fentanyl is 80 to 100 times more potent 
1
than morphine and killed 18,335 Americans in 
2
2018. 
3
(10) Chinese scientists and authorities knew 
4
about the coronavirus as early as December 2019, 
5
but were ordered by Chinese government officials on 
6
January 3, 2020, to transfer samples to state insti-
7
tutions or destroy them. 
8
(11) The CCP refused to allow the World 
9
Health Organization to visit their country and re-
10
fused repeated offers of assistance from the U.S. 
11
Centers for Disease Control throughout the month 
12
of January 2020. 
13
(12) The Chinese government did not concede 
14
clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of 
15
the coronavirus until January 19, 2020. 
16
(13) China chose to lock down the city of 
17
Wuhan on January 23, 2020, but not before 
18
5,000,000 people had already left the city. 
19
(14) Chinese doctors who attempted to provide 
20
transparency regarding the consequences of the 
21
SARS–CoV–2 virus were arbitrarily arrested, and 
22
several remain unaccounted for. 
23
(15) The Chinese government imposed travel 
24
bans on its own people but told other nations, in-
25
22:01 Oct 02, 2021

•HR 5431 IH
cluding neighboring ones, that similar restrictions 
1
were unnecessary. 
2
(16) There have been more than 714,000 
3
deaths from COVID–19 in the United States and 
4
approximately 4,800,000 deaths, globally. 
5
(17) The Director of the Federal Bureau of In-
6
vestigation Christopher Wray recently described ‘‘the 
7
greatest long-term threat to our Nation’s informa-
8
tion and intellectual property, and to our economic 
9
vitality, is the counterintelligence and economic espi-
10
onage threat from China.’’. 
11
(18) Director Wray unequivocally identified the 
12
source of this economic espionage, malignant foreign 
13
influence, and menacing threat: ‘‘when I speak of 
14
the threat from China, I mean the Government of 
15
China and the Chinese Communist Party.’’. 
16
(19) According to the updated 2017 report 
17
issued by the Commission on the Theft of American 
18
Intellectual Property, the PRC is responsible for co-
19
ordinating a massive campaign in intellectual prop-
20
erty 
theft, 
stealing 
anywhere 
between 
21
$250,000,000,000 and $600,000,000,000 annually 
22
from the United States.

(20) The IP Commission’s estimate does not in-
1
clude the ‘‘full cost of patent infringement—an area 
2
sorely in need of greater research’’. 
3
(21) The United States Trade Representative 
4
has confirmed the findings of the 2017 IP Commis-
5
sion’s report. 
6
(22) The IP Commission found that forced 
7
technology transfer accounts for anywhere from 
8
$180,000,000,000 to $540,000,000,000 per year in 
9
lost value for the United States economy; of that 
10
value, the IP Commission also found that China ac-
11
counts for the most of that theft. 
12
(23) According to Director Wray, the level of 
13
the CCP criminality is so widespread and volumi-
14
nous that ‘‘the FBI is opening a new China-related 
15
counterintelligence case about every 10 hours and of 
16
the nearly 5,000 active FBI counterintelligence cases 
17
currently underway across the country, almost half 
18
are related to China.’’. 
19
(24) The nonprofit investigative body, China 
20
Tribunal, detailed in their March 2020 report that 
21
the CCP’s campaign of forced organ harvesting 
22
against innocent victims could constitute one of the 
23
world’s ‘‘worst atrocities committed’’ in modern 
24
times.

(25) The 2019 report issued by the Congres-
1
sional-Executive Commission on China described the 
2
failure of the CCP to protect the human rights of 
3
its citizens: ‘‘[The 2019 report] found that the 
4
human rights situation has worsened and the rule of 
5
law continues to deteriorate, as the Chinese Govern-
6
ment and Party increasingly used regulations and 
7
laws to assert social and political control . . . The 
8
abuse of criminal law and police power to target 
9
rights advocates, religious believers, and ethnic mi-
10
nority groups also continues unabated, and reporting 
11
on such abuses became increasingly restricted.’’. 
12
(26) The criminally negligent actions taken by 
13
the CCP following their discovery of the coronavirus 
14
contributed to the loss of millions of American jobs 
15
and the onset of a global recession.
