(1) Section 3003 of the Carl Levin and Howard 
1
P. ‘‘Buck’’ McKeon National Defense Authorization 
2
Act for Fiscal Year 2015 (16 U.S.C. 539p) author-
3
izes Oak Flat, which is sacred to Indian Tribes in 
4
the region and is part of the larger Chı´’chil 
5
Bi5dagoteel Traditional Cultural Property listed in 
6
the National Register of Historic Places, to be 
7
transferred to Resolution Copper. 
8
(2) Resolution Copper plans to hold Oak Flat 
9
privately for a mining project that will— 
10
(A) result in the physical destruction of 
11
Tribal sacred areas and deprive American Indi-
12
ans from practicing their religious ceremonies 
13
and other traditional practices; 
14
(B) create significant negative environ-
15
mental impacts by destroying Oak Flat and de-
16
pleting and contaminating precious water re-
17
sources; and 
18
(C) require significant quantities of water, 
19
which will— 
20
(i) likely affect the local hydrology, in-
21
cluding the underlying aquifer; and 
22
(ii) result in polluted water that will 
23
seep into drinking water supplies.

(3)(A) Once Resolution Copper owns Oak Flat, 
1
Resolution Copper plans to use the highly destruc-
2
tive block cave mining method to remove 1 cubic 
3
mile of ore that (as of the date of enactment of this 
4
Act) is located 7,000 feet beneath the surface of the 
5
earth without replacing any of the earth removed, 
6
because that is the cheapest form of mining. 
7
(B) Resolution Copper admits that the surface 
8
of Oak Flat will subside and ultimately collapse, de-
9
stroying forever the Tribal sacred areas described in 
10
paragraph (2)(A). 
11
(4) The Tonto National Forest in which Oak 
12
Flat is located was established in 1905 from the an-
13
cestral homelands of American Indians, who were 
14
forcibly removed at gunpoint from Oak Flat and 
15
other areas of the Forest by the Army during the 
16
1880s and held as prisoners of war until the early 
17
1900s.

cumvented the will of the majority of Members

of Congress; and 
2
(ii) was originally introduced in the House 
3
of Representatives as H.R. 687 and in the Sen-
4
ate as S. 339 during the 113th Congress. 
5
(B) H.R. 687 was— 
6
(i) brought to the floor of the House of 
7
Representatives for consideration twice; and 
8
(ii) pulled from consideration each time. 
9
(C) S. 339 was never considered—

(i) by the Senate; or 
11
(ii) for mark-up by the Committee on En-
12

either the House of Representatives or the Senate.

19

(ii) suffered under Federal assimilationist 
1
policies that sought to destroy Tribal cultures. 
2
(B) Despite those policies, American Indians 
3
continue to practice their religions as they have done 
4
for thousands of years. 
5
(C) American Indian places of worship, or sa-
6
cred areas, are often land-based, including moun-
7
tains, streams, and trees. 
8
(D) As a result of previous Federal land poli-
9
cies that resulted in the significant loss of land of 
10
Indian Tribes, many sacred areas of the Tribes are 
11
currently located on Federal land. 
12
(7)(A) The United States has a trust responsi-
13
bility acknowledged by Congress to protect Tribal 
14
sacred areas on Federal land, including pursuant to 
15
laws requiring meaningful consultation with affected 
16
Indian Tribes before making decisions that will im-
17
pact American Indians; but 
18
(B) in contradiction to those laws, section 3003 
19
of the Carl Levin and Howard P. ‘‘Buck’’ McKeon 
20
National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 
21
2015 (16 U.S.C. 539p) requires the mandatory con-
22
veyance of a Tribal sacred area located on Federal 
23
land, regardless of the outcome of consultation with 
24
affected Indian Tribes.

1
P. ‘‘Buck’’ McKeon National Defense Authorization 
2
Act for Fiscal Year 2015 (16 U.S.C. 539p)— 
3
(A) was strongly opposed by Indian Tribes 
4
throughout the United States because that sec-
5
tion establishes a dangerous legislative prece-
6
dent for the lack of protection of Tribal sacred 
7
areas located on Federal land by mandating the 
8
conveyance of Federal land with significant reli-
9
gious, cultural, historic, and anthropological 
10
significance for Indian Tribes to a private com-
11
pany that will destroy the land;

(B) circumvents standard environmental 
13
review procedures that ensure that the public 
14
interest is protected, including the interests of 
15
Indian Tribes; and
