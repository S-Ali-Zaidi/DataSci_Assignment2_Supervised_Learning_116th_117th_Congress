commodity (commonly known as ‘‘checkoff pro-
1
grams’’) are intended to increase demand for all of 
2
that agricultural commodity and benefit all assessed 
3
producers of that agricultural commodity; 
4
(2) although the laws establishing checkoff pro-
5
grams broadly prohibit the use of funds in any man-
6
ner for the purpose of influencing legislation or gov-
7
ernment action, checkoff programs have repeatedly 
8
been shown to use funds to influence policy directly 
9
or by partnering with organizations that lobby; 
10
(3) the unlawful use of checkoff programs funds 
11
benefits some agricultural producers while harming 
12
many others; 
13
(4) to more effectively prevent Boards from 
14
using funds for unlawful purposes, strict separation 
15
of engagement between the Boards and policy enti-
16
ties is necessary; 
17
(5) conflicts of interest in the checkoff pro-
18
grams allow special interests to use checkoff pro-
19
gram funds for the benefit of some assessed agricul-
20
tural producers at the expense of many others; 
21
(6) prohibiting conflicts of interest in checkoff 
22
programs is necessary to ensure the proper and law-
23
ful operation of the checkoff programs; 
24

•HR 4291 IH
(7) checkoff programs are designed to promote 
1
agricultural commodities, not to damage other types 
2
of agricultural commodities through anticompetitive 
3
conduct or otherwise; 
4
(8) prohibiting anticompetitive and similar con-
5
duct is necessary to ensure proper and lawful oper-
6
ation of checkoff programs; 
7
(9) lack of transparency in checkoff programs 
8
enables abuses to occur and conceals abuses from 
9
being discovered; and 
10
(10) requiring transparency in the expenditure 
11
of checkoff program funds is necessary to prevent 
12
and uncover abuses in checkoff programs.
