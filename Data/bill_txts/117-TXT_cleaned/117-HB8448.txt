A BILL 
To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to end the 
tax subsidy for employer efforts to influence their work-
ers’ exercise of their rights around labor organizations 
and engaging in collective action. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘No Tax Breaks for 
4
Union Busting (NTBUB) Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress makes the following findings: 
7
(1) The National Labor Relations Act (29 
8
U.S.C. 151 et seq.) declares that it is the right of 
9
employees to form, join, or assist labor organiza-
10
tions. 
11
(2) The National Labor Relations Act further 
12
declares that it is ‘‘the policy of the United States 
13
to eliminate the causes of certain substantial ob-
14
structions to the free flow of commerce and to miti-
15
gate and eliminate these obstructions when they 
16
have occurred by encouraging the practice and pro-
17
cedure of collective bargaining and by protecting the 
18
exercise by workers of full freedom of association, 
19
self-organization, and designation of representatives 
20
of their own choosing . . .’’.

(3) Despite Congress’ intention to give workers 
1
full agency in these matters, many employers regu-
2
larly choose to involve themselves, lawfully or unlaw-
3
fully, in the decisions of their employees about 
4
whether to avail themselves of their rights under the 
5
National Labor Relations Act and the Railway 
6
Labor Act (45 U.S.C. 151 et seq.). 
7
(4) Employers frequently violate labor laws 
8
around organizing and collective action. The Eco-
9
nomic Policy Institute finds that in approximately 4 
10
of 10 labor organization elections in 2016–2017 em-
11
ployers were charged with committing an unfair 
12
labor practice. Among larger bargaining units of 61 
13
employees or more, over 54 percent of elections have 
14
an unfair labor practice charge. 
15
(5) In practice, these unfair labor practices 
16
often include charges such as employees being ille-
17
gally fired for labor organization activity, refusal to 
18
bargain in good faith with labor organizations, or co-
19
ercion and intimidation. Employers also frequently 
20
use captive audience meetings, workplace surveil-
21
lance, and other lawful or unlawful tactics to sway 
22
labor organization elections. 
23
(6) Whether or not there are charges of unlaw-
24
ful behavior, employers spend millions of dollars to 
25
16:39 Jul 25, 2022
H8448
4 
•HR 8448 IH
sway the opinions of their employees with respect to 
1
whether or how to exercise their rights under the 
2
National Labor Relations Act and the Railway 
3
Labor Act. According to the Economic Policy Insti-
4
tute report, companies spent $340,000,000 yearly on 
5
outside consultants to sway their workers’ opinions 
6
about labor organization activities. This and other 
7
spending interfere with the United States goal of 
8
‘‘encouraging the practice and procedure of collective 
9
bargaining’’. 
10
(7) The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 has 
11
long recognized that spending by businesses with the 
12
purpose of influencing the general public with re-
13
spect to elections, while it may be lawful, is not tax 
14
deductible. Congress should extend that principle to 
15
spending done by employers to influence workers’ 
16
elections and collective bargaining decisions. These 
17
free choices to exercise the rights to engage in collec-
18
tive bargaining, labor organization representation, 
19
and other lawful collective activities should be made 
20
without taxpayer subsidies of undue outside influ-
21
ence from employers.
