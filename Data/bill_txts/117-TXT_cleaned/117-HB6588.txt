•HR 6588 IH
(1) According to projections from Georgetown 
1
University’s Center on Education and the Work-
2
force, the United States was already set to experi-
3
ence a shortage of 5,000,000 workers with postsec-
4
ondary education or training, including training 
5
leading to vocational certificates and apprenticeship 
6
training, by 2020. The COVID–19 pandemic has 
7
only exacerbated this problem. 
8
(2) Registered apprenticeships strengthen the 
9
Nation’s economy, create pathways to good-paying 
10
careers, and help meet the Nation’s current work-
11
force demands. 
12
(3) Apprenticeships can help fill the Nation’s 
13
workforce needs, including in fields not traditionally 
14
linked to apprenticeships, such as cybersecurity. 
15
(4) The cybersecurity field has a severe short-
16
age in talent, with over 597,000 job openings today, 
17
according to CyberSeek, an interactive cybersecurity 
18
jobs heat map funded by the Department of Com-
19
merce’s National Institute of Standards and Tech-
20
nology (NIST). 
21
(5) Employers, especially in cybersecurity and 
22
information technology fields, may be unfamiliar 
23
with the apprenticeship model or do not have the ca-
