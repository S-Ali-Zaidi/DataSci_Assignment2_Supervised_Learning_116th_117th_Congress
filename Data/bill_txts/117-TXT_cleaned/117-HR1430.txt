RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the Bangladesh Genocide of 1971. 
Whereas, in August 1947, British rule in India ended, cre-
ating the 2 independent sovereign countries of India and 
Pakistan, the latter of which included the noncontiguous 
regions of West Pakistan (Pakistan) and East Pakistan 
(Bangladesh), also known as East Bengal; 
Whereas the Pakistani ruling elite was comprised overwhelm-
ingly of West Pakistanis who concentrated the country’s 
resources and development efforts in West Pakistan to 
the detriment of East Pakistan’s development; 
Whereas West Pakistani officials harbored well-documented 
anti-Bengali sentiment, considering Bengalis to be a less-
er people group that had been corrupted by un-Islamic 
practices;

Whereas, during elections held in 1970, the Awami League, 
led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, won a majority in Par-
liament on a platform of autonomy for East Pakistan; 
Whereas negotiations to form a government between Paki-
stani President, General Agha Muhammad Yahya Khan, 
Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto leader of the Pakistan People’s 
Party, and Sheikh Mujibur Rahman failed; 
Whereas, at a meeting on February 22, 1971, General Yahya 
Khan is recorded as saying to his top military brass 
‘‘[k]ill 3 million of them and the rest will eat out of our 
hands’’; 
Whereas, on the night of March 25, 1971, the Government 
of Pakistan imprisoned Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and 
Pakistani military units, in conjunction with radical 
Islamist groups, began a general crackdown throughout 
East Pakistan code-named ‘‘Operation Searchlight’’ that 
involved widespread massacres of civilians; 
Whereas atrocities continued during the ensuing 9-month 
Bangladesh War of Independence as the Pakistani mili-
tary scapegoated ethnic Bengalis and Hindus and tar-
geted supporters of the Awami League, Bengali military 
or police personnel, intellectuals, students, and profes-
sionals, while victims included members of both majority 
(Bengali Muslim) and minority (non-Muslim) commu-
nities; 
Whereas the genocide against ethnic Bengalis and Hindus is 
one of the forgotten genocides of the 20th century and 
its lack of recognition remains an open wound for mil-
lions of people who were directly effected by the atroc-
ities;

Whereas estimates of the number of those killed in these 
atrocities vary, with the Government of Bangladesh esti-
mating that 3,000,000 persons were killed; 
Whereas over 200,000 women were raped and, due to stigma, 
the full number will likely never be known nor the victims 
remembered; 
Whereas, as a result of the atrocities and the war, nearly 
10,000,000 refugees fled to India, and countless others, 
up to 50 percent of Bangladesh’s population, were inter-
nally displaced; 
Whereas the Government and people of India magnanimously 
cared for the refugees until the culmination of hostilities; 
Whereas in a seminal column on June 13, 1971, for The 
Sunday Times, titled ‘‘Genocide’’, journalist Anthony 
Mascarenhas wrote ‘‘It seems clear that the ‘sorting out’ 
began to be planned about the time that Lt.-Gen. Tikka 
Khan took over the governorship of East Bengal.’’ and 
continues ‘‘When the army units fanned out in Dacca on 
the evening of March 25, in pre-emptive strikes against 
the mutiny planned for the small hours of the next morn-
ing many of them carried lists of people to be liquidated. 
These included the Hindus and large numbers of Mus-
lims; students, Awami Leaguers, professors, journalists 
and those who had been prominent in Sheik Mujib’s 
movement.’’; 
Whereas, on March 28, 1971, United States Consul General 
in Dacca, Archer Blood, sent a telegram to Washington 
titled ‘‘Selective Genocide’’ in which he wrote ‘‘Moreover, 
with support of Pak military, non-Bengali Muslims are 
systematically attacking poor people’s quarters and mur-
dering Bengalis and Hindus. Streets of Dacca are aflood

with Hindus and others seeking to get out of Dacca. 
Many Bengalis have sought refuge in homes of Ameri-
cans, most of whom are extending shelter.’’; 
Whereas, on April 6, 1971, in what became known as the 
‘‘Blood Telegram’’, Consul General Blood sent by way of 
the State Department’s dissent channel an objection to 
official United States Government silence on the conflict 
signed by 20 members of the United States diplomatic 
staff of Consulate General Dacca which reads in part 
‘‘But we have chosen not to intervene, even morally, on 
the grounds that the Awami conflict, in which unfortu-
nately the overworked term genocide is applicable, is 
purely internal matter of a sovereign state. Private Amer-
icans have expressed disgust.’’ and in which objection 
Blood concurs stating ‘‘I believe the views of these offi-
cers, who are among the finest U.S. officials in East 
Pakistan, are echoed by the vast majority of the Amer-
ican community, both official and unofficial. I also sub-
scribe to these views but I do not think it appropriate for 
me to sign their statement as long as I am principal offi-
cer at this post.’’; 
Whereas, on April 8, 1971, Consul General Blood sent an-
other telegram which states in part ‘‘ ‘Genocide’ applies 
fully to [this] naked, calculated and widespread selection 
of Hindus for special treatment . . . From outset various 
members of American community have witnessed either 
burning down of Hindu villages, Hindu enclaves in Dacca 
and shooting of Hindus attempting [to] escape carnage, 
or have witnessed after-effects which [are] visible 
throughout Dacca today.’’; 
Whereas Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Chairman of the Sen-
ate Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee To Investigate 
21:28 Oct 14, 2022

•HRES 1430 IH 
the Problems Connected with Refugees and Escapees 
published a report to the Committee on November 1, 
1971, which states ‘‘Nothing is more clear, or more easily 
documented, than the systematic campaign of terror— 
and its genocidal consequences—launched by the Paki-
stan army on the night of March 25th. Field reports to 
the U.S. Government, countless eye-witness journalistic 
accounts, reports of international agencies such as the 
World Bank, and additional information available to the 
Subcommittee document the continuing reign of terror 
which grips East Bengal. Hardest hit have been members 
of the Hindu community who have been robbed of their 
lands and shops, systematically slaughtered, and, in some 
places, painted with yellow patches marked ‘H’. All of 
this has been officially sanctioned, ordered and imple-
mented under martial law from Islamabad.’’; 
Whereas the war ended on December 16, 1971, and Ban-
gladesh became an independent country; 
Whereas, in a legal study published in 1972 titled ‘‘The 
Events in East Pakistan’’, the Secretariat of the Inter-
national Commission of Jurists states ‘‘There is over-
whelming evidence that Hindus were slaughtered, and 
their houses and villages destroyed simply because they 
were Hindus.’’; 
Whereas, in 1994, reflecting on his time covering the war, 
New York Times correspondent Sydney Schamberg wrote 
‘‘Later I toured the country by road to see the Pakistani 
legacy firsthand. In town after town there was an execu-
tion area where people had been killed by bayonet, bullet 
and bludgeon. In some towns, executions were held on a 
daily basis . . . This was a month after the war’s end 
(i.e., January 1972), . . . human bones were still scat-

tered along many roadsides. Blood stained clothing and 
tufts of human hair clung to the brush at these killing 
grounds. Children too young to understand were playing 
grotesque games with skulls. Other reminders were the 
yellow ‘H’s the Pakistanis had painted on the homes of 
Hindus, particular targets of the Muslim army.’’; 
Whereas in its ‘‘Declaration in Commemoration of the 50th 
Anniversary of the Bangladesh Genocide’’ United States 
nongovernmental organization Genocide Watch states 
‘‘Throughout the nine months of their anti-independence 
occupation of East Pakistan, the Pakistani Military 
Forces persecuted, tortured, and murdered representa-
tives of Bengali culture and identity, including poets, mu-
sicians, professors, journalists, physicians, scientists, 
writers, and film makers.’’; 
Whereas the United Nations Convention on the Prevention 
and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, signed at 
Paris on December 9, 1948, declares that genocide 
‘‘means any of the following acts committed with the in-
tent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, 
racial or religious group, as such: (a) Killing members of 
the group; (b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to 
members of the group; (c) Deliberately inflicting on the 
group conditions of life calculated to bring about its 
physical destruction in whole or in part; (d) Imposing 
measures intended to prevent births within the group; (e) 
Forcibly transferring children of the group to another 
group.’’ and ‘‘The following acts shall be punishable: (a) 
Genocide; (b) Conspiracy to commit genocide; (c) Direct 
and public incitement to commit genocide; (d) Attempt to 
commit genocide; (e) Complicity in genocide.’’;

Whereas United States nongovernmental organizations Geno-
cide Watch and the Lemkin Institute for Genocide Pre-
vention have sought international recognition of the 
atrocities committed by the Armed Forces of Pakistan as 
genocide; and 
Whereas it is of the utmost importance to recall and docu-
ment crimes against humanity, war crimes, and genocide 
for the sake of posterity, to preserve the memory of the 
victims, and to deter future atrocities: Now, therefore, be 
it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) condemns the atrocities committed by the 
2
Armed Forces of Pakistan against the people of 
3
Bangladesh from March 1971 to December 1971; 
4
(2) recognizes that such atrocities against eth-
5
nic Bengalis and Hindus constitute crimes against 
6
humanity, war crimes, and genocide; 
7
(3) recalls the death and suffering of the count-
8
less victims of such atrocities and expresses its deep 
9
sympathy for the suffering; 
10
(4) recognizes that entire ethnic groups or reli-
11
gious communities are not responsible for the crimes 
12
committed by their members;

crimes, and genocide; 
2
(6) calls on the Government of Pakistan, in the 
3
face of overwhelming evidence, to offer acknowledge-
4
ment of its role in such genocide, offer formal apolo-
5
gies to the Government and people of Bangladesh,

and prosecute, in accordance with international law, 
7
any perpetrators who are still living; and 
8
(7) reaffirms the United States commitment to 
9
promoting peace, stability, and intercommunal har-
10
mony in the Indo-Pacific region, and the right of all 
11
people living in the region, regardless of national, ra-

cial, ethnic, or religious background, to enjoy the

benefits of democratic institutions, the rule of law,

the freedom of religion, and economic opportunity.
