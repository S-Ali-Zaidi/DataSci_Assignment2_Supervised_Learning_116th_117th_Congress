Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following find-

•HR 5247 IH
(1) The COVID–19 pandemic has had serious 
1
impacts on the health and well-being of children and 
2
families. 
3
(2) Unemployment and poverty, as well as 
4
lengthy business, school, and child care closures, 
5
have all contributed to elevated levels of food insecu-
6
rity, with an estimated 14,000,000 children in the 
7
United States not getting enough to eat. 
8
(3) Millions of children receive free or reduced- 
9
price meals through early childhood education pro-
10
grams, including school and early care and education 
11
programs such as childcare, Head Start, pre-kinder-
12
garten, and family childcare, making early childhood 
13
education an important setting for addressing food 
14
insecurity. 
15
(4) More than 30,000,000 children receive free 
16
or reduced-price meals on a daily basis, and access 
17
to both breakfast and lunch can provide some chil-
18
dren with more than half of their daily caloric in-
19
take. 
20
(5) Due to financial instability during the 
21
COVID–19 pandemic, there is an increased likeli-
22
hood of unhealthy weight gain among children as 
23
families shift to less costly, calorically dense, shelf- 
24
stable foods, rather than fresh foods. 
25

(6) Research has shown that early childhood is 
1
an important time for developing dietary and phys-
2
ical activity behaviors that support health and well- 
3
being and that may help prevent obesity. 
4
(7) Children who are exposed to healthy foods 
5
early are more likely develop eating habits that pro-
6
mote healthy growth that can continue throughout 
7
childhood, and healthy eating can improve a child’s 
8
learning ability, potentially lead to higher academic 
9
performance, improve mental, social, and physical 
10
well-being, and contribute to increased self-esteem. 
11
(8) Research underscores the importance of 
12
physical activity in early childhood. It is not only es-
13
sential for healthy weight maintenance, but also for 
14
practicing and learning fundamental gross motor 
15
skills and improving academic achievement. Further-
16
more, when children have the opportunity for ade-
17
quate physical activity, they benefit physically, psy-
18
chologically and socially. 
19
(9) Nearly 20 percent (1 in 5) of 2-year-olds 
20
spend more than 2 hours of a typical day watching 
21
television or videos, and the Journal of the American 
22
Medical Association Pediatrics found that each in-
23
cremental hour of watching television at age 2 is as-
24
sociated with corresponding declines in school en-

gagement, math achievement, and weekend physical 
1
activity, and with increases in bullying by class-
2
mates, consumption of soft drinks and snacks, and 
3
body mass index at age 10. 
4
(10) A study published in the New England 
5
Journal of Medicine in 2014 found that a third of 
6
children overweight in kindergarten had obesity by 
7
the eighth grade. Almost every child with severe obe-
8
sity remained that way, suggesting that efforts must 
9
start much earlier and focus more on the children at 
10
greatest risk. 
11
(11) A study published in the New England 
12
Journal of Medicine in 2017 estimates that over 50 
13
percent of 2-year-olds today will be obese by 35 
14
years of age. 
15
(12) A study examining the National Health 
16
and Nutrition Examination Survey published in 
17
2018 found an increase in prevalence of childhood 
18
obesity in 2015 and 2016. Childhood obesity for 
19
children between 2 and 5 years of age increased 
20
from 9 percent to 14 percent, the highest increase 
21
since 1999. 
22
(13) In 2016, about 82 percent of United 
23
States preschool-aged children were in childcare, and 
24
most of their day was spent in sedentary activities.

(14) Early care and education centers serve ap-
1
proximately 7,500,000 children birth through age 5 
2
years but not yet in kindergarten, making the early 
3
childhood care and education setting an important 
4
one for promoting healthful habits. 
5
(15) More than 122,000 children in 12 States 
6
have benefitted from efforts to support healthier 
7
early care and education programs. This includes 
8
the provision of training and coaching for childcare 
9
providers and technical assistance to State agencies 
10
to integrate nutrition and physical activity best prac-
11
tices into existing State and local systems. 
12
(b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this Act are to— 
13
(1) establish a program that will enhance the 
14
training and knowledge of early care and education 
15
providers and influence practices, policies, and envi-
16
ronments in early care and education settings to 
17
support healthy eating and physical activity for chil-
18
dren ages birth through 5, including by addressing 
19
the growing threat of food insecurity; 
20
(2) provide support to States on ways to link 
21
early care and education programs to nutrition sup-
22
ports;
