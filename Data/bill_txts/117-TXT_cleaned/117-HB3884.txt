1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

Rights Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The U.S. State Department’s 2020 Human 
3
Rights Report on the Philippines states ‘‘There were 
4
numerous reports of government security agencies 
5
and their informal allies committed arbitrary or un-
6
lawful killings in connection with the government di-
7
rected campaign against illegal drugs.’’. The Report 
8
goes on to state, ‘‘Government mechanisms to inves-
9
tigate and punish abuse and corruption in the secu-
10
rity forces were poorly resourced and remained 
11
largely ineffective’’. The United Nations Office of 
12
the High Commissioner on Human Rights in its an-
13
nual report for the 44th Session of the Human 
14
Rights Council concluded that there is ‘‘long-stand-
15
ing overemphasis on public order and national secu-
16
rity at the expense of human rights has become 
17
more acute in recent years, and there are concerns 
18
that the vilification of dissent is being increasingly 
19
institutionalized and normalized in ways that will be 
20
very difficult to reverse;’’. 
21
(2) The United States continues to provide sup-
22
port via security assistance to the administration of 
23
Philippines President Duterte, whose brutal Drug 
24
War and other campaigns have taken the lives of 
25
over 30,000 urban poor, peasants, workers, indige-
26

nous and environmental activists as well as human 
1
rights defenders, religious leaders, and peace advo-
2
cates. 
3
(3) Government agencies of the Philippines re-
4
port 4,948 suspected drug users and dealers, includ-
5
ing 60 children, died during police operations from 
6
July 1, 2016 to September 30, 2018, and according 
7
to Human Rights Watch, the Philippine National 
8
Police (PNP) have reported 22,983 deaths remain 
9
classified as ‘‘homicides under investigation’’ since 
10
the Drug War began. 
11
(4) As of December 2020, the Alliance for Ad-
12
vancement of People’s Rights (‘‘Karapatan’’) has 
13
documented 376 extrajudicial political killings, 488 
14
victims of attempted politically motivated killings, 
15
222 victims of torture, around 3,600 victims of ille-
16
gal arrests, over 100,000 victims of threats and har-
17
assments, and nearly half a million internal refugees 
18
under the Duterte administration. 
19
(5) Duterte has blatantly targeted and publicly 
20
advocated for the killing of faith leaders. Catholic 
21
Bishops, priests, pastors, and laity have been threat-
22
ened, intimidated, harassed and murdered for speak-
23
ing out against extra-judicial killings and the war on 
24
drugs. 
25

•HR 3884 IH
(6) Duterte has also abused his office by tar-
1
geting critics and political opponents for intimida-
2
tion and elimination. Since Duterte took office, over 
3
30 labor leaders have been murdered and 3 have 
4
been jailed as political prisoners, over 25 mayors 
5
and vice mayors have been assassinated, and Sen-
6
ator Leila De Lima who has been a staunch critic 
7
of the drug war killings having been detained for 
8
over 4 years. 
9
(7) The international NGO Global Witness has 
10
declared the Philippines to be the deadliest country 
11
in the world for defenders of human rights, the envi-
12
ronment, and natural resources, with 30 environ-
13
mentalists, 54 indigenous people, and 207 farmers 
14
and peasants extrajudicially killed since Duterte 
15
took office in 2016. Included in the targeting of en-
16
vironmental activists was American citizen, Brandon 
17
Lee, who was subjected to an assassination attempt 
18
on August 6, 2019. Brandon has been subjected to 
19
repeated threats and harassment by the Philippine 
20
military due to his advocacy relating to the land and 
21
rights of indigenous people in Ifugao province and 
22
the surrounding Cordillera region of the Philippines. 
23
While Brandon Lee survived the attack, he has been

left paralyzed and his assailants have not been 
1
brought to justice. 
2
(8) It is widely recognized that the Duterte ad-
3
ministration silences dissent and the press. The 
4
State Department’s 2019 Report states, ‘‘Govern-
5
ment harassment of some media outlets occurred, 
6
however, and polls suggested many Filipinos con-
7
sider it dangerous to publish information critical of 
8
the administration.’’. In May 2020, ABS-CBN, one 
9
of the Philippines’ two major sources of news, and 
10
an occasional critic of Duterte’s policies, was forced 
11
off air due to the denial of a franchise license by the 
12
Congress of the Philippines, at the behest of the 
13
Duterte administration. Similarly, Maria Ressa, a 
14
vocal critic of the Duterte administration, Times 
15
Magazine’s Person of the Year 2018 recipient, and 
16
founder of the digital news site Rappler was con-
17
victed of cyber libel in June 2020. 
18
(9) On July 3, 2020 the Anti-Terrorism Act of 
19
the Philippines was passed into law. While pur-
20
porting to counter terrorism, the bill rolls back many 
21
civil liberties by lessening requirements for judicial 
22
warrants, allows for extended pre-trial detention, 
23
and allows for the prosecution of conduct that is 
24
considered protected political speech. The Anti-Ter-
25
06:37 Jul 14, 2021
H3884
6 
•HR 3884 IH
rorism Act is viewed by many as a threat to Free-
1
dom of Speech in the Philippines and yet another 
2
tool the Duterte administration will use to silence 
3
critics and political rivals. Representative Jan Scha-
4
kowsky, along with 49 other members of the U.S. 
5
Congress, urged the government of the Philippines 
6
to repeal ‘‘this repressive legislation’’. 
7
(10) The practice of ‘‘red-tagging’’, wherein the 
8
government labels activists, critics, and non-govern-
9
mental organizations as terrorists, has been growing 
10
in the Philippines from 2020 to 2021. This tactic is 
11
used to isolate individuals or groups and, in many 
12
cases, mark them for harassment or assassination by 
13
Philippines security or paramilitary forces. 
14
(11) On March 7, 2021, the Armed Forces of 
15
the Philippines (AFP) and Philippines National Po-
16
lice (PNP) carried out a series of joint operations 
17
across Calabarzon. The operations led to the murder 
18
of nine activists and the arrest of six others. The 
19
victims were members of progressive organizations 
20
that advocated around issues of labor, land and in-
21
digenous rights, environmental protections, and 
22
housing rights for the urban poor. The Philippine 
23
government claims that it carried out the raids in 
24
Calabarzon to execute valid search warrants for 
25
06:37 Jul 14, 2021
H3884
7 
•HR 3884 IH
weapons and that the killings only resulted from the 
1
victims resisting arrest. This claim has been met 
2
with extreme skepticism due to the government’s 
3
history of fabricating evidence and ‘‘red-tagging’’ 
4
progressive groups and activists. Further suspicion 
5
was cast on the allegations of resisting arrest when 
6
family members of the victims were prohibited by 
7
the PNP and AFP from collecting the victim’s bod-
8
ies. Following the attacks in Calabarzon, Duterte’s 
9
spokesperson endorsed the killings of the activists 
10
and security forces began to surveil and harass 
11
human rights groups that are investigating the 
12
killings. 
13
(12) The United States continues to arm state 
14
security forces of the Philippines. Despite clear doc-
15
umentation of abuses and international condemna-
16
tion, in April 2020, the United States announced a 
17
pair of arms sales totaling $2,000,000,000 for items 
18
including hellfire missiles and attack helicopters. In 
19
July 2020, the United States announced an addi-
20
tional sale of $126,000,000 worth of assault boats 
21
and armaments.
