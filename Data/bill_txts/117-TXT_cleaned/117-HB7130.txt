A BILL 
To direct the Secretary of Defense to convey the Ma¯kua 
Military Reservation to the State of Hawai‘i and estab-
lish a trust fund for such conveyance, and for other 
purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This bill may be cited as the ‘‘Leandra Wai Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
5
Congress finds the following:

•HR 7130 IH
(1) Leandra Wai was a co-founder of the Na-
1
tive Hawaiian-led non-profit Ma¯lama Ma¯kua, served 
2
as its president, and grounded the organization as 
3
its cultural practitioner until her passing in 2016. 
4
She embodied the cultural healing power of Ma¯kua 
5
Valley, and was the heart, soul, and spirit of 
6
Ma¯lama Ma¯kua as the organization fought in Fed-
7
eral court to stop live-fire training in the sacred val-
8
ley. Twice per month, from 2002 until shortly before 
9
her passing, Wai led cultural access into Ma¯kua Val-
10
ley, facilitating the cultural reconnection of thou-
11
sands of community members with Ma¯kua. Her lead-
12
ership still guides Ma¯lama Ma¯kua. 
13
(2) Ma¯kua, which means ‘‘parents’’ in Hawai-
14
ian, is a sacred site, rich in culture and biological re-
15
sources. 
16
(3) Ma¯kua Military Reservation (in this section 
17
referred to as ‘‘MMR’’) contains more than 100 
18
sites eligible for listing on the National Register of 
19
Historic 
Places, 
including 
Hawaiian 
temples, 
20
shrines, petroglyphs, and other sacred, cultural, and 
21
historic sites. Past military live-fire training has 
22
damaged Ma¯kua’s cultural sites, bombing them and 
23
pockmarking them with bullet holes. Moreover, con-
24
17:01 Mar 29, 2022

•HR 7130 IH
tinued military occupation of MMR severely limits 
1
access by Native Hawaiian cultural practitioners. 
2
(4) In Native Hawaiian stories and legends, or 
3
‘‘mo‘olelo’’, Ma¯kua is an important place within a 
4
much more expansive traditional cultural landscape 
5
and network of interrelated sites. It has heightened 
6
cultural significance because of its relationship to 
7
other sites. 
8
(5) Military training-related fires at MMR 
9
threaten more than 40 species of animals and plants 
10
protected under the Endangered Species Act (Public 
11
Law 93–205; 16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.), as well as na-
12
tive habitat identified as critical to the survival and 
13
recovery of these imperiled species. Additionally, 
14
training-related fires have burned thousands of acres 
15
at MMR. 
16
(6) Historically, Ma¯kua was considered ‘‘ ‘a¯ina 
17
momona’’, or fertile land, with evidence of extensive 
18
agricultural terracing that could have produced sub-
19
stantial amounts of food and provided access to im-
20
portant offshore fisheries. 
21
(7) Traditional and customary practices, such 
22
as fishing, gathering of plants, and funerary prac-
23
tices, have continued at Ma¯kua in different forms to 
24
the present. 
25

•HR 7130 IH
(8) Toxins from military training and related 
1
activities at MMR, such as prescribed burns, con-
2
taminate Ma¯kua’s air, land, and water. Contami-
3
nants are transported to civilian areas beyond 
4
MMR’s boundaries—to Ma¯kua Beach and the 
5
ocean—via the air, Ma¯kua’s streams, overland flow 
6
during storm events, and groundwater. 
7
(9) The Armed Forces seized Ma¯kua for train-
8
ing shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor, evict-
9
ing the families who had lived there for generations, 
10
bombing their church, and destroying their homes. 
11
The Armed Forces promised to return the land to 
12
the local families six months after the end of hos-
13
tilities but broke that promise. Nearly eight decades 
14
after World War II ended, the Armed Forces still 
15
occupy MMR. 
16
(10) In addition to seizing Hawaiian trust 
17
lands, the Armed Forces condemned kuleana land 
18
grants from Native Hawaiian families. 
19
(11) MMR lies just across Farrington Highway, 
20
a public roadway, from Ma¯kua Beach, a public 
21
beach where local children play, and local families 
22
gather fish and limu to put food on their tables. 
23
(12) The Armed Forces have not conducted live 
24
fire training at MMR since June 2004. For more 
25

•HR 7130 IH
than 23 years, Hawai‘i-based military units have 
1
consistently and repeatedly been able to achieve 
2
readiness to deploy for combat missions without con-
3
ducting any live-fire training at MMR. 
4
(13) The Wai‘anae district is home to one of 
5
the largest concentrations of Native Hawaiians any-
6
where, yet approximately one-third of Wai‘anae’s 
7
land is occupied by the Armed Forces. The commu-
8
nity has been burdened with multiple threats to 
9
health, safety, and the environment, which is re-
10
flected in poor health and socioeconomic indicators. 
11
(14) Ma¯kua is an important site for the revital-
12
ization of Native Hawaiian cultural practices and a 
13
valuable educational resource for Hawaiian culture, 
14
history, ecology, and environmental restoration.
