with section 2824 of the Public Health Service Act, as 
9
added by subsection (b). Such guidance shall address the 
10
sharing, for public health surveillance purposes, of speci-
11
mens of such pathogens, between appropriate entities and 
12
public health authorities pursuant to the regulations pro-
13
mulgated under section 264(c) of the Health Insurance 
14
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (42 U.S.C.
