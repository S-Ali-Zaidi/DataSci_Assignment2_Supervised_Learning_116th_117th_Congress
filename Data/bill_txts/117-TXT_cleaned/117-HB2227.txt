A BILL 
To extend the life of the Minuteman III and redirect savings 
from development of the new ground-based strategic de-
terrent program toward the development of a universal 
coronavirus vaccine, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Investing in Cures Be-

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) According to the Congressional Budget Of-
3
fice, the projected cost to sustain and modernize the 
4
United States nuclear arsenal, as of 2017, ‘‘is $1.2 
5
trillion in 2017 dollars over the 2017–2046 period: 
6
more than $800 billion to operate and sustain (that 
7
is, incrementally upgrade) nuclear forces and about 
8
$400 billion to modernize them’’. With inflation, the 
9
cost rises to $1,700,000,000,000 and does not in-
10
clude the cost of the additional nuclear capabilities 
11
proposed in the 2018 Nuclear Posture Review. 
12
(2) The Government Accountability Office 
13
found in July 2020 that the Department of Defense 
14
and the National Nuclear Security Administration 
15
have still not taken meaningful steps to address af-
16
fordability concerns or heeded the Government Ac-
17
countability Office’s recommendation to consider 
18
‘‘deferring the start of or cancelling specific mod-
19
ernization programs’’, including the W87–1 warhead 
20
modification program, to address increases in the 
21
weapons activities budget requests of the National 
22
Nuclear Security Administration. 
23
(3) The ground-based strategic deterrent pro-
24
gram is expected to cost between $93,100,000,000 
25
and $95,800,000, which does not include the cost of 
26
00:59 May 27, 2021
H2227
3 
•HR 2227 IH
the W87–1 warhead modification program or the 
1
cost to produce new plutonium pits for the warhead. 
2
The total estimated life cycle cost of the ground- 
3
based 
strategic 
deterrent 
program 
is 
4
$264,000,000,000, and the program is intended to 
5
replace 400 deployed Minuteman III missiles with 
6
more than 600 new missiles, to allow for test flights 
7
and spares. 
8
(4) The Air Force awarded a sole-source con-
9
tract to Northrop Grumman for the engineering and 
10
manufacturing component of the ground-based stra-
11
tegic deterrent program in September 2020, raising 
12
concerns that the absence of competition for the 
13
award may result in higher than projected costs to 
14
United States taxpayers. 
15
(5) The National Nuclear Security Administra-
16
tion is also in the early stages of developing a re-
17
placement intercontinental ballistic missile warhead, 
18
the W87–1, and expanding plutonium pit production 
19
to build new warhead cores, costing at least 
20
$12,000,000,000 and $9,000,000,000, respectively, 
21
to meet the modernization needs of the ground-based 
22
strategic deterrent program. 
23
(6) Maintaining and updating the current Min-
24
uteman III missiles is possible for multiple decades 
25
00:59 May 27, 2021
H2227

•HR 2227 IH
and, according to the Congressional Budget Office, 
1
through 2036 this would cost $37,000,000,000 less 
2
in 2017 dollars than developing and deploying the 
3
ground-based strategic deterrent program. 
4
(7) A public opinion poll conducted from Octo-
5
ber 12 to 28, 2020, by ReThink Media and the Fed-
6
eration of American Scientists found that only 26 
7
percent of registered voters in the United States pre-
8
ferred replacing the Minuteman III intercontinental 
9
ballistic missile with the ground-based strategic de-
10
terrent, as compared to 60 percent of registered vot-
11
ers who opposed replacing the Minuteman III mis-
12
sile. 
13
(8) On April 3, 2019, Lieutenant General Rich-
14
ard M. Clark, then-Air Force Deputy Chief of Staff 
15
for Strategic Deterrence and Nuclear Integration, 
16
noted in testimony before the Committee on Armed 
17
Services of the House of Representatives that we 
18
have ‘‘one more opportunity’’ to conduct life exten-
19
sion on the Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic 
20
missile, indicating the technical feasibility of extend-
21
ing the Minuteman III missile despite his stated 
22
preference for the ground-based strategic deterrent. 
23
(9) Even in the absence of an intercontinental 
24
ballistic missile leg of the triad, the 2018 Nuclear 
25
00:59 May 27, 2021
H2227

•HR 2227 IH
Posture Review signaled that the United States 
1
would have an assured retaliatory capability in the 
2
form of several ballistic missile submarines, which 
3
are, ‘‘at present, virtually undetectable, and there 
4
are no known, near-term credible threats to the sur-
5
vivability of the [ballistic missile submarine] force’’, 
6
a benefit that will be enhanced as the Department 
7
of Defense moves to replace the Ohio class ballistic 
8
submarine fleet with the new Columbia class ballistic 
9
missile fleet. 
10
(10) While intercontinental ballistic missiles 
11
had historically been the most responsive leg of the 
12
United States nuclear triad, advances in ballistic 
13
missile submarine communications to allow for the 
14
dissemination of emergency action messages in war-
15
time have negated that advantage. 
16
(11) Intercontinental ballistic missiles cannot be 
17
recalled, leaving decision-makers with mere minutes 
18
to decide whether to launch the missiles before they 
19
are destroyed, known as a posture of ‘‘launch on 
20
warning’’ or ‘‘launch under attack’’ in the face of a 
21
perceived nuclear attack, greatly increasing the risk 
22
of a national leader initiating a nuclear war by mis-
23
take.

•HR 2227 IH
(12) In 1983, Stanislav Petrov, a former lieu-
1
tenant colonel of the Soviet Air Defense Forces cor-
2
rectly identified a false warning in an early warning 
3
system that showed several United States incoming 
4
nuclear missiles, preventing Soviet leaders from 
5
launching a retaliatory response, earning Colonel 
6
Petrov the nickname ‘‘the man who saved the 
7
world’’. 
8
(13) Former Secretary of Defense William 
9
Perry, who once briefed President Bill Clinton on a 
10
suspected Russian first nuclear strike, wrote that 
11
the ground-based leg of the nuclear triad is ‘‘desta-
12
bilizing because it invites an attack’’ and interconti-
13
nental ballistic missiles are ‘‘some of the most dan-
14
gerous weapons in the world’’ and ‘‘could even trig-
15
ger an accidental nuclear war’’. 
16
(14) General James Cartwright, former vice 
17
chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and former Com-
18
mander of the United States Strategic Command, 
19
wrote, with Secretary Perry, ‘‘[T]he greatest danger 
20
is not a Russian bolt but a US blunder—that we 
21
might accidentally stumble into nuclear war. As we 
22
make decisions about which weapons to buy, we 
23
should use this simple rule: If a nuclear weapon in-
24
creases the risk of accidental war and is not needed 
25
00:59 May 27, 2021
H2227
7 
•HR 2227 IH
to deter an intentional attack, we should not build 
1
it. . . . Certain nuclear weapons, such as . . . the 
2
[intercontinental ballistic missile], carry higher risks 
3
of accidental war that, fortunately, we no longer 
4
need to bear. We are safer without these expensive 
5
weapons, and it would be foolish to replace them.’’. 
6
(15) General George Lee Butler, the former 
7
Commander-in-Chief of the Strategic Air Command 
8
and subsequently Commander-in-Chief of the United 
9
States Strategic Command, said, ‘‘I would have re-
10
moved land-based missiles from our arsenal a long 
11
time ago. I’d be happy to put that mission on the 
12
submarines. So, with a significant fraction of bomb-
13
ers having a nuclear weapons capability that can be 
14
restored to alert very quickly, and with even a small 
15
component of Trident submarines—with all those 
16
missiles and all those warheads on patrol—it’s hard 
17
to imagine we couldn’t get by.’’. 
18
(16) While a sudden ‘‘bolt from the blue’’ first 
19
strike from a near-peer nuclear adversary is a highly 
20
unlikely scenario, extending the Minuteman III 
21
would maintain the purported role of the interconti-
22
nental ballistic missile leg of the triad to absorb such 
23
an attack.

SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY ON EXTENSION OF LIFE-
1
SPAN OF MINUTEMAN III AND DEVELOPING A

It is the policy of the United States that— 
4
(1) the operational life of the Minuteman III

missiles can be safely extended until at least 2050; 
6
and 
7
(2) investments in developing a universal
