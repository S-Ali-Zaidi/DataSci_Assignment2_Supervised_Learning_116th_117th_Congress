RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for designation of the first week of 
December 2022 as National United States Miners Week. 
Whereas December 6 was established by Congress in 2009 to 
honor the hard work and commitment of miners in the 
United States; 
Whereas America’s mining men and women are foundational 
to modern economies and are necessary for a high quality 
of life for all citizens; 
Whereas the critical minerals, coal, and other raw materials 
harvested by American miners out of domestic mines 
produce more than $82 billion in raw materials annually;

Whereas the critical minerals, coal, and other raw materials 
unearthed by miners are crucial to secure supply chains 
needed for steel, roads, houses, cars, smartphones, ven-
tilators, wind turbines, solar panels, and everything else 
in our world that is not grown; 
Whereas America’s miners mine or support other industries 
in all 50 States; 
Whereas there are more than 500,000 directly employed min-
ers in America, supporting another 1.8 million jobs in 
manufacturing, engineering, and environmental sciences; 
Whereas each miner in America indirectly supports an addi-
tional 3 jobs in spinoff industries such as health care, 
hospitality, education, and others, and are located in 
largely rural communities; 
Whereas America’s miners support billions in State and Fed-
eral royalty revenues, funding education, child care, and 
diversifying economic development in their communities; 
and 
Whereas America would rely more on countries like Russia, 
China, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and others 
who rely on child and slave labor to produce minerals 
needed for modern life if it weren’t for American miners: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the work of America’s mining men 
2
and women; and 
3
(2) recognizes the importance of America’s min-
4
ers in securing our domestic supply chains.
