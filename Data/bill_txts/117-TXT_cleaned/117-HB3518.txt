SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. 
1
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following find-
2
ings: 
3
(1) 
From 
1961 
to 
1971, 
approximately 
4
19,000,000 gallons of 15 different herbicides were 
5
sprayed over the southern region of Vietnam. 
6
(2) The herbicides included 13,000,000 gallons 
7
of Agent Orange, 4,500,000 gallons of Agent White, 
8
1,000,000 gallons of Agent Blue, 420,000 gallons of 
9
Agent Purple, and relatively smaller quantities of 
10
the other herbicides. Many of the herbicides, includ-
11
ing Agents Orange, Purple, Green, Pink, Dinoxol, 
12
and Trinoxol contained the toxic contaminant dioxin 
13
(TCDD). Agent Blue contained high levels of ar-
14
senic. The aforementioned 15 herbicides, including 
15
the contaminant dioxin, are usually collectively re-
16
ferred to as Agent Orange. 
17
(3) Between 1968 and 1971, a total of 6,500 
18
spraying missions were carried out in an area of 
19
about 1,500,000 hectares, which represented about 
20
12 percent of South Vietnam and portions of Laos 
21
and Cambodia. 
22
(4) Studies show that between 2,100,000 and 
23
4,800,000 Vietnamese and tens of thousands of 
24
Americans were exposed to Agent Orange during the 
25
spraying. Many other Vietnamese were or continue

to be exposed to Agent Orange through contact with 
1
the environment and food that was contaminated. 
2
Many offspring of those who were exposed have 
3
birth defects, developmental disabilities, and other 
4
diseases. 
5
(5) Today, there are still dozens of environ-
6
mental hot spots that continue to contaminate the 
7
food, soil, sediment, livestock, and wildlife with 
8
Agent Orange. Concentrations of TCDD as high as 
9
1,000 mg/kg have been found in soil and sediment 
10
samples more than 50 years after Agent Orange was 
11
sprayed in Vietnam. 
12
(6) The United States has provided some as-
13
sistance to Vietnam in remediating Agent Orange 
14
contamination at the largest of these hotspots, which 
15
are the airbases that handled the spray missions. 
16
The Da Nang Airport has been fully cleaned up, and 
17
the United States has committed funds to contribute 
18
to cleaning up the Bien Hoa Airbase, which is the 
19
most contaminated site in Vietnam. There are at 
20
least two dozen other smaller hotspots scattered 
21
throughout southern and central Vietnam that also 
22
must be remediated, since they continue to expose 
23
local populations to dioxin and arsenic.

(7) Agent Orange exposure continues to nega-
1
tively affect the lives of veterans of the United 
2
States Armed Forces, Vietnamese people, Viet-
3
namese Americans, and their children. The lives of 
4
many victims are cut short and others live with dis-
5
ease, disabilities, and pain, often untreated or unrec-
6
ognized. 
7
(8) The Department of Veterans Affairs recog-
8
nizes 15 illnesses and diseases, including AL amyloi-
9
dosis, chronic B-cell leukemia, chloracne, diabetes 
10
mellitus type 2, Hodgkin’s disease, ischemic heart 
11
disease, 
multiple 
myeloma, 
non-Hodgkin’s 
12
lymphoma, Parkinson’s disease, acute and sub-acute 
13
peripheral neuropathy, porphyria cutanea tarda, 
14
prostate cancer, respiratory cancers, and soft-tissue 
15
sarcomas as associated with the spraying and use of 
16
Agent Orange by the United States Armed Forces 
17
during the Vietnam era. 
18
(9) No similar consideration has been given to 
19
affected Vietnamese or Vietnamese Americans. 
20
(10) The Department of Veterans Affairs pro-
21
vides compensation for many severe birth defects 
22
among the children of American women veterans 
23
who served in Vietnam. The list of birth defects cov-
24
ered includes but is not limited to: Achondroplasia, 
25
22:36 Jun 23, 2021

•HR 3518 IH
cleft lip, cleft palate, congenital heart disease, con-
1
genital talipes equinovarus (clubfoot), esophageal 
2
and intestinal atresia, Hallerman-Streiff syndrome, 
3
hip dysplasia, Hirschsprung’s disease (congenital 
4
megacolon), hydrocephalus due to aqueductal ste-
5
nosis, hypospadias, imperforate anus, neural tube 
6
defects, 
Poland 
syndrome, 
pyloric 
stenosis, 
7
syndactyly (fused digits), tracheoesophageal fistula, 
8
undescended testes, and Williams syndrome. Af-
9
fected children of these women veterans receive med-
10
ical care and other benefits. However, the care and 
11
compensation provided by the Department of Vet-
12
erans Affairs to the covered children of United 
13
States veterans is insufficient to meet their needs. 
14
(11) The only birth defect recognized for the 
15
children of male American veterans is spina bifida 
16
(but not occulta). However, many children of male 
17
Vietnam War veterans have the same range of birth 
18
defects and diseases, resulting in most affected chil-
19
dren of United States veterans receiving no care or 
20
benefits. 
21
(12) No assistance has been given to the chil-
22
dren of male or female Vietnamese or Vietnamese 
23
Americans connected with their exposure, or their 
24
parents’ or grandparents’ exposure.

•HR 3518 IH
(13) The Institute of Medicine for the past sev-
1
eral years has noted that ‘‘it is considerably more 
2
plausible than previously believed that exposure to 
3
the herbicides sprayed in Vietnam might have 
4
caused paternally mediated transgenerational effects 
5
. . . attributable to the TCCD contaminant in 
6
Agent Orange.’’. In recent years, scientific studies 
7
have identified likely epigenetic links between expo-
8
sure to toxins and birth defects and developmental 
9
disorders in subsequent generations. Some of the 
10
children and grandchildren of exposed persons 
11
(Americans, Vietnamese, and Vietnamese Ameri-
12
cans) who were in southern Vietnam during the 
13
Vietnam era likely suffer from disorders, birth de-
14
fects, and illnesses related to Agent Orange. 
15
(14) Since 2007, the United States has engaged 
16
in environmental remediation of contamination at 
17
the Da Nang airport, and more recently the Bien 
18
Hoa airport, and has provided funds for public 
19
health and disabilities activities for individuals resid-
20
ing in some affected areas. 
21
(15) Laos and Cambodia were also sprayed 
22
with Agent Orange during the Vietnam era. At least 
23
527,000 gallons of Agent Orange were sprayed in 
24
Laos and significant amounts were sprayed in Cam-

bodia. Affected Lao and Cambodian people over sev-
1
eral generations suffer from medical conditions, 
2
birth defects and disabilities similar to those seen in 
3
Vietnam and in the United States. The United 
4
States has the responsibility to take action to miti-
5
gate and provide compensations for those effects. 
6
Further action will be needed to ascertain and effec-
7
tively address this legacy of the Vietnam War. 
8
(b) PURPOSE.—It is the purpose of this Act to ad-
9
dress and remediate the ongoing damage that arose or will 
10
arise from the use of Agent Orange during the Vietnam 
11
era.
