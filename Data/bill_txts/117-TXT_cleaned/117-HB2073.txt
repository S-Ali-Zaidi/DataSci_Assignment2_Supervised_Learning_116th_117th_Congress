moval coal mining until health studies are conducted 
by the Department of Health and Human Services, and 
for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 2073 IH
(1) Communities surrounding mountaintop re-
1
moval coal mining projects, which involve surface 
2
coal mining including blasting with explosives in the 
3
steep slope regions of Kentucky, Tennessee, West 
4
Virginia, and Virginia, have raised concerns that 
5
pollution of the water, air, and soil that results from 
6
mountaintop removal coal mining may be causing 
7
health crises in their communities. 
8
(2) Peer-reviewed scientific research and re-
9
ports have raised serious concerns about mountain-
10
top removal mining with respect to elevated risks in 
11
categories of birth defects studied: circulatory, res-
12
piratory, central nervous system, musculoskeletal, 
13
and gastrointestinal. 
14
(3) Mountaintop removal coal mining has also 
15
been associated with elevated levels of adult hos-
16
pitalizations for chronic pulmonary disorders and hy-
17
pertension that are elevated as a function of county- 
18
level coal production, as are rates of mortality; lung 
19
cancer; and chronic heart, lung, and kidney disease. 
20
These health problems strike both women and men 
21
in mountaintop removal coal mining communities. 
22
These elevated levels of disease, defects, and mor-
23
tality persist even after controlling for other vari-
24
ables.

(4) Initial scientific evidence, and the level of 
1
public concern, warrant immediate action to stop 
2
new mountaintop removal coal mining permits and 
3
increase environmental and human health moni-
4
toring at existing mountaintop removal coal mining 
5
projects while the reported links between health ef-
6
fects and mountaintop removal coal mining are in-
7
vestigated by Federal health agencies.

(5) The National Institute of Environmental

Health Sciences is uniquely qualified to manage a 
10
working group of Federal health agencies with ex-
11
pertise that is relevant to study of the reported

links.

cy and the heads of such other Federal departments and

19
(1) conduct or support comprehensive studies 
20
on the health impacts, if any, of mountaintop re-
21
moval coal mining on individuals in the surrounding

communities; and

(2) submit to the Secretary, and make publicly

available, a report on the results of such studies.
