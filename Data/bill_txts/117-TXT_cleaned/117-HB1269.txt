SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS. 
3
(a) SHORT TITLE.—This Act may be cited as the 
4
‘‘Social Security and Medicare Lock-Box Act’’. 
5
(b) FINDINGS REGARDING SOCIAL SECURITY AND 
6
MEDICARE PART A.—The Congress finds the following: 
7
(1)(A) Long-term projections show serious 
8
problems facing the fiscal health of the trust funds 
9
associated with Social Security and Medicare Hos-
10
pital Insurance. 
11
(B) According to the 2020 Annual Report of 
12
the Board of Trustees of the Federal Old-Age and 
13
Survivors Insurance and Federal Disability Insur-
14
ance Trust Funds, the assets of the combined Fed-
15
eral Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund 
16
and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund 
17
will be exhausted in 2035, and the Disability Insur-
18
ance Trust Fund alone will be depleted in 2065. 
19
(C) According to the 2020 Annual Report of 
20
the Board of Trustees of the Federal Hospital In-

•HR 1269 IH
surance, the assets of the Federal Hospital Insur-
1
ance Trust Fund will be exhausted in 2026. 
2
(2) The Trustees of these trust funds encourage 
3
lawmakers to address the long-term financial chal-
4
lenges of the Social Security and Medicare programs 
5
as soon as possible. 
6
(3) Social Security and Medicare are meant to 
7
provide a secure and stable base so that older Amer-
8
icans can live in dignity. 
9
(4) Protecting the future surpluses of these 
10
trust funds can only occur when meaningful reform 
11
has been enacted by Congress. Any path to solvency 
12
must include the protection of future surpluses.
