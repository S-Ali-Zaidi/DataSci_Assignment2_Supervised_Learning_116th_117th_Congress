(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:

•HR 9418 IH
(1) Under a longstanding law, the annual rates 
1
of pay for Members of Congress are subject to cost- 
2
of-living adjustments whenever the President adjusts 
3
the annual rates of pay applicable to Federal em-
4
ployees covered by the General Schedule. 
5
(2) The 27th Amendment to the Constitution of 
6
the United States, ratified in 1992, prohibits any 
7
law ‘‘varying the compensation of Senators and Rep-
8
resentatives’’ from taking effect until after the next 
9
regularly scheduled general election for Members of 
10
the House of Representatives. 
11
(3) Since the 27th Amendment was ratified, on 
12
over a dozen occasions Congress has enacted a law 
13
to prohibit these cost-of-living adjustments from tak-
14
ing effect, which means that each of these laws has 
15
varied the compensation of Members of Congress 
16
from what the compensation would have been if 
17
these laws had not been enacted. 
18
(4) In nearly every instance, each of these laws 
19
took effect prior to the next election for Members of 
20
the House, in violation of the 27th Amendment. 
21
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
22
gress that, in order to provide relief from the changes 
23
which were made to the annual rates of pay of Members 
24
of Congress by laws which were in violation of the 27th

scribed in paragraph (1) shall be the rate which would 
13
have applied to such positions during the most recent pay 
14
period beginning before the date of the enactment of this
