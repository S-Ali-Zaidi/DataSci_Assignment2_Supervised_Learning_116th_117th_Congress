3
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
4
(1) The use of technology in health care and 
5
coverage of telehealth services are rapidly evolving. 
6
(2) Research has found that telehealth services 
7
can expand access to care, improve the quality of 
8
care, and reduce spending, and that patients receiv-
9
ing telehealth services are satisfied with their experi-
10
ences.

•HR 2903 IH
(3) Health care workforce shortages are a sig-
1
nificant problem in many areas and for many types 
2
of health care clinicians. 
3
(4) Telehealth increases access to care in areas 
4
with workforce shortages and for individuals who 
5
live far away from health care facilities, have limited 
6
mobility or transportation, or have other barriers to 
7
accessing care. 
8
(5) The use of health technologies can strength-
9
en the expertise of the health care workforce, includ-
10
ing by connecting clinicians to specialty consulta-
11
tions. 
12
(6) Prior to the COVID–19 pandemic, the utili-
13
zation of telehealth services in the Medicare program 
14
under title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 
15
U.S.C. 1395 et seq.) was low, with only 0.25 percent 
16
of Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries utilizing tele-
17
health services in 2016. 
18
(7) The COVID–19 pandemic demonstrated ad-
19
ditional benefits of telehealth, including reducing in-
20
fection risk of patients and health care professionals 
21
and conserving space in health care facilities, and 
22
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention rec-
23
ommended that telehealth services should be opti-

mized, when available and appropriate, during the 
1
pandemic. 
2
(8) Long-term certainty about coverage of tele-
3
health services under the Medicare program is nec-
4
essary to fully realize the benefits of telehealth. 
5
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
6
gress that— 
7
(1) health care providers can furnish safe, effec-
8
tive, and high-quality health care services through 
9
telehealth; 
10
(2) the Secretary of Health and Human Serv-
11
ices should promptly take all necessary measures to 
12
ensure that providers and beneficiaries can continue 
13
to furnish and utilize, respectively, telehealth serv-
14
ices in the Medicare program during and after the 
15
conclusion of the COVID–19 pandemic, including 
16
modifying, as appropriate, the definition of ‘‘inter-
17
active telecommunications system’’ in regulations 
18
and program instruction under the Medicare pro-
19
gram to ensure that providers can utilize all appro-
20
priate means and types of technology, including 
21
audio-visual, audio-only, and other types of tech-
22
nologies, to furnish telehealth services; and 
23
(3) barriers to the use of telehealth should be 
24
removed.
