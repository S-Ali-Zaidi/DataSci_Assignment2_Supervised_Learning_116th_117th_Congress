knowledgment of workers in flower-producing countries 
and to demonstrate the commitment of the United States 
to practices that respect labor rights in other countries.

Whereas Colombian flower workers and flower workers in 
other flower-producing countries face daily health risks 
from contact with pesticides; 
Whereas three of the pesticides used previously in close prox-
imity to Colombian flower workers have been found to be 
extremely toxic, and others have been found to be car-
cinogenic and are restricted for use in the United States; 
Whereas such pesticides can cause serious health impacts, in-
cluding blood and skin cancer, and the repetitive motions 
involved in flower cultivation, picking, and processing can 
lead to other health conditions; 
Whereas many female flower workers in Colombia must take 
pregnancy tests and use birth control in order to gain or 
maintain employment, reportedly due to their proximity 
to pesticides that can cause birth defects and health risks 
for pregnant women; 
Whereas the labor force of the Colombian flower-production 
industry is predominantly female, one-third of whom are 
single mothers; 
Whereas Colombian flower workers work from 12 to 22 hours 
per day, six days a week, from Valentine’s Day to Moth-
er’s Day, while earning pay that is insufficient to allow 
them to rise out of poverty; 
Whereas workloads and production goals for Colombian flow-
er workers have progressively increased over the years 
since the beginning of the flower-production industry in 
Colombia in the mid-1960s; 
Whereas Colombian flower workers have been denied their 
rights to collectively organize, bargain, or strike;

Whereas the Colombian Action Plan Related to Labor Rights, 
signed on April 7, 2011, was designed to improve labor 
conditions for workers in Colombia across various sectors; 
Whereas the American Federation of Labor and Congress of 
Industrial Organizations has suggested revisions to the 
plan in order to ensure worker safety in Colombia; and 
Whereas the commemoration of International Flower Work-
ers’ Day would acknowledge and reaffirm the commit-
ment of the United States to labor rights: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the designation of International
