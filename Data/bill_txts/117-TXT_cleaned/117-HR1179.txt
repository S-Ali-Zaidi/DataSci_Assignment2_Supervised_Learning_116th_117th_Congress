RESOLUTION 
Recognizing and promoting the role of demonstration farm 
networks in expanding the adoption of conservation farm-
ing practices that improve the health of watersheds and 
agricultural lands. 
Whereas one-third of the Nation’s topsoil and more than 38 
percent of topsoil within the Nation’s Corn Belt have 
eroded into lakes, rivers, and streams; 
Whereas excessive amounts of phosphorus and other nutri-
ents found in the topsoil that leave the rural landscape 
and enter lakes, rivers, and streams fuel algal blooms and 
increase the potential for harmful algal blooms, hypoxia, 
cyanobacteria, and impaired waters;

Whereas conservation farming practices of reduced tillage, 
cover crops, managed grazing, and manure management 
allow for soils to build organic matter, which stabilizes 
soils and minimizes sediment loss through the erosive 
forces of wind and water; 
Whereas conservation farming practices of cover crops, low- 
disturbance manure application, and buffer strips reduce 
runoff of sediment, phosphorus, and nutrients into water-
ways; 
Whereas conservation farming practices of reduced tillage, 
cover crops, and planting into green boost the growth of 
soil organic matter and reduce compaction, fostering im-
proved infiltration during a heavy rain event and resil-
ience during a drought; 
Whereas conservation farming practices support long-term 
sustainability for soil health and economic sustainability 
for producers through reduced inputs on fields; 
Whereas peer-to-peer education about conservation farming 
practices and cost shares increases producer adoption 
and lessens financial risks when transitioning from con-
ventional to conservation farming practices; 
Whereas demonstration farm networks ensure growers have 
opportunity and resources for peer-to-peer education 
about conservation farming practices; 
Whereas demonstration farm networks are designed to show-
case and demonstrate leading-edge conservation practices 
that improve water quality by preventing sediment, phos-
phorus, and nutrients from entering freshwater sources; 
Whereas the demonstration farm networks’ partnerships con-
sist of agricultural producers, agronomists, county land 
and water conservation staff, Department of Agriculture

and Natural Resources Conservation Service employees, 
and in some networks, representatives from academia 
and nonprofits; 
Whereas such partnerships assist and enable producers to 
achieve success when implementing new conservation 
farming practices; 
Whereas the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative enabled the 
formation of the first demonstration farm network and 
continues to support demonstration farm networks across 
the country; 
Whereas the first demonstration farm network was launched 
in 2013 through an agreement with the Department of 
Agriculture and Natural Resources Conservation Service, 
Brown County, Wisconsin, and 4 producers in the Lower 
Fox River Watershed of northeast Wisconsin’s Eighth 
Congressional District; 
Whereas the number of demonstration farm networks in Wis-
consin has grown to 6 networks of 33 farms spanning 16 
counties, including— 
(1) the Lower Fox Watershed Demonstration Farms 
Network, including— 
(A) Brickstead Dairy; 
(B) VandeWettering Farms; 
(C) Greg Nettekoven; 
(D) Neighborhood Dairy; 
(E) VanWychen Farms; 
(F) Larry Dufek of Dairyland Farms; and

Farm Network, including— 
(A) Brey Cycle Farms; 
(B) Kinnard Farms;

•HRES 1179 IH 
Whereas the growth and success of demonstration farm net-
works in Wisconsin have led the Department of Agri-
culture and Natural Resources Conservation Service to 
replicate the model in other States, including— 
(1) New York, with the Genesee River Demonstra-
tion Farms Network (established pursuant to an agree-
ment between the Department of Agriculture and Nat-
ural Resources Conservation Service and American 
Farmland Trust); 
(2) Pennsylvania, with the Upper Genesee River 
Demonstration Farms Network (established pursuant to 
an agreement between the Department of Agriculture 
and Natural Resources Conservation Service and Head-
waters Resource Conservation & Development Council); 
and 
(3) Ohio, with the Blanchard River Demonstration 
Farms Network (established pursuant to an agreement 
between the Department of Agriculture and Natural Re-
sources Conservation Service and Ohio Farm Bureau); 
Whereas the growth and success of the demonstration farm 
networks have laid the groundwork for the formation of 
producer-led watershed groups and conservation farming 
initiatives in Wisconsin, such as Save the Bay, that pro-
mote and support education on conservation farming 
practices; and 
Whereas conservation farming best management practices 
shared among demonstration farm networks, producer-led 
groups, and initiatives like Save the Bay have led to ex-
ponential growth of conservation farming practices across 
watersheds, resulting in the protection and improvement 
of freshwater sources and soil quality: Now, therefore, be 
it
