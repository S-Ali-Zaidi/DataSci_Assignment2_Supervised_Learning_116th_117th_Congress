SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Fostering Overseas

3
2021’’ or the ‘‘FOREST Act of 2021’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
5
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following find-
6
ings: 
7
(1) According to the Food and Agriculture Or-
8
ganization of the United Nations, 31 percent of land 
9
on earth is covered in forests, but that area is rap-
10
idly decreasing. An estimated 1,600,000 square 
11
miles of forest has been converted to other land uses 
12
since 1990, with 42,500 square miles converted an-
13
nually since 2010. Since the early 2000s, 2⁄3 of glob-
14
al forest cover loss has occurred in the tropics and 
15
subtropics. 
16
(2) The expansion of commercial agriculture 
17
into tropical forests is the largest driver of forest 
18
conversion, led by cattle ranching and the cultivation 
19
of soy and palm oil. An estimated 69 percent of such 
20
conversion between 2013 and 2019 was carried out 
21
in contravention of the laws of the country in which 
22
the conversion occurred. 
23
(3) Such illegal deforestation results in the 
24
emission of more than 2.7 gigatons of carbon dioxide 
25
03:37 Oct 14, 2021
H5508

•HR 5508 IH
equivalent per year, more than the entire annual fos-
1
sil fuel emissions of India in 2018. 
2
(4) Limiting global temperatures below 1.5 de-
3
grees Celsius above preindustrialized levels requires 
4
rapid and significant reductions in deforestation 
5
globally. Cost-effective greenhouse gas emission miti-
6
gation from forests and land use can provide roughly 
7
1⁄3 of the mitigation required by 2030 to stay below 
8
2 degrees Celsius. 
9
(5) Forests contain most of the world’s terres-
10
trial biodiversity, providing habitats for 80 percent 
11
of amphibian species, 75 percent of bird species, 68 
12
percent of mammal species, and 60,000 different 
13
species of trees. 
14
(6) Forests are also an important source of live-
15
lihoods, 
food, 
and 
fuel, 
with 
more 
than 
16
1,600,000,000 people depending directly on forests 
17
for their livelihoods. 
18
(7) The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Plat-
19
form on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services found 
20
in 2019 that the rate of global species extinction is 
21
accelerating and is now tens to hundreds of times 
22
higher than the average rate over the last 
23
10,000,000 years, threatening the loss of 1,000,000 
24

•HR 5508 IH
species, and land-use change is the direct driver with 
1
the largest relative impact on terrestrial ecosystems. 
2
(8) Deforestation in many countries is closely 
3
associated with violations of the rights of indigenous 
4
peoples and local communities and with the exploi-
5
tation of workers, including through the use forced 
6
labor and child labor, and in many cases is enabled 
7
by corruption, criminality, and violence against indi-
8
viduals defending their land rights and environment. 
9
(9) According to the United Nations High Com-
10
missioner for Human Rights, individuals defending 
11
the rights of communities and indigenous peoples to 
12
their traditional lands and environment are particu-
13
larly vulnerable to threats and violence and ac-
14
counted for roughly half of the killings of human 
15
rights defenders documented in 2019. 
16
(10) Congress has taken a number of steps to 
17
address the trade in illegal timber to protect legiti-
18
mate forestry businesses and reduce illegal logging 
19
globally, such as, in section 8204 of the Food, Con-
20
servation, and Energy Act of 2008 (Public Law 
21
110–246; 122 Stat. 2052), amending the Lacey Act 
22
Amendments of 1981 (16 U.S.C. 3371 et seq.) to 
23
prohibit the importation of illegal plant products, in-
24
03:37 Oct 14, 2021
H5508
5 
•HR 5508 IH
cluding such products made from illegally logged 
1
wood. 
2
(11) As with illegal timber, agricultural com-
3
modities produced on illegally deforested land enter 
4
international markets, including the United States, 
5
and compete with commodities produced legally. 
6
(12) The United States is a significant market 
7
for products made wholly or in part of commodities 
8
such as palm oil, cattle, cocoa, and rubber at risk of 
9
being produced on illegally deforested land. For ex-
10
ample, in 2020, the United States imported— 
11
(A) processed cowhides and beef products 
12
valued at more than $500,000,000 from Brazil, 
13
where cattle ranching is the largest driver of 
14
deforestation in the Amazon forest and other 
15
biomes, and an estimated 95 percent of all de-
16
forestation was not in full compliance with ap-
17
plicable laws; and 
18
(B) crude palm oil and palm kernel oil val-
19
ued at more than $880,000,000 and oleochemi-
20
cals commonly derived from palm oils valued at 
21
more than $390,000,000, from Indonesia, 
22
where the expansion of palm oil plantations is 
23
the largest driver of deforestation, and govern-
24
ment audits of the sector in recent years have 
25
03:37 Oct 14, 2021
H5508
6 
•HR 5508 IH
indicated widespread noncompliance with appli-
1
cable laws. 
2
(13) The lack of traceability in the supply 
3
chains for such commodities and the absence of im-
4
porter due diligence requirements increases the risk 
5
that United States trade is associated with illegal 
6
deforestation and human rights abuses, preventing 
7
United States consumers from knowing where or 
8
how the goods they purchase were produced and 
9
putting companies that ensure legal sourcing at a 
10
competitive disadvantage. 
11
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
12
gress that the United States must do more to address ille-
13
gal deforestation from agricultural commodities, includ-
14
ing— 
15
(1) avoiding trade that incentivizes foreign gov-
16
ernments to allow illegal deforestation; 
17
(2) assisting foreign governments in eliminating 
18
illegal deforestation and limiting all deforestation to 
19
the extent practicable; 
20
(3) requiring that goods entering the United 
21
States market be subject to requirements, including 
22
the necessary supply chain traceability, to reduce the 
23
risk of association with illegal deforestation; 
24
03:37 Oct 14, 2021
H5508
7 
•HR 5508 IH
(4) preventing the United States financial sys-
1
tem from being used to launder proceeds from illegal 
2
deforestation; and 
3
(5) providing incentives to suppliers of the Fed-
4
eral Government to adopt and implement policies to 
5
eliminate goods produced on or from deforested land 
6
from their supply chains.
