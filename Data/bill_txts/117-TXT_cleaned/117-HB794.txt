SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘National Climate 
2
Emergency Act of 2021’’ or the ‘‘Climate Emergency Act 
3
of 2021’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
5
Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) The years 2010 to 2019 were the hottest 
7
decade on record. 
8
(2) Global atmospheric concentrations of the 
9
primary global warming pollutant, carbon dioxide— 
10
(A) have increased by 40 percent since 
11
preindustrial times, from 280 parts per million 
12
to 415 parts per million, primarily due to 
13
human activities, including the burning of fossil 
14
fuels and deforestation; 
15
(B) are rising at a rate of 2 to 3 parts per 
16
million annually; and 
17
(C) must be reduced to not more than 350 
18
parts per million, and likely lower, ‘‘if humanity 
19
wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on 
20
which civilization developed and to which life on 
21
Earth is adapted,’’ according to former Na-
22
tional Aeronautics and Space Administration 
23
climatologist Dr. James Hansen. 
24
(3) Global atmospheric concentrations of other 
25
global warming pollutants, including methane, ni-
26
17:32 Feb 24, 2021
H794

•HR 794 IH
trous oxide, and hydrofluorocarbons, have also in-
1
creased substantially since preindustrial times, pri-
2
marily due to human activities, including the burn-
3
ing of fossil fuels. 
4
(4) Climate science and observations of climate 
5
change impacts, including ocean warming, ocean 
6
acidification, floods, droughts, wildfires, and extreme 
7
weather, demonstrate that a global rise in tempera-
8
ture of 1.5 degree Celsius above preindustrial levels 
9
is already having dangerous impacts on human pop-
10
ulations and the environment. 
11
(5) According to the 2018 National Climate As-
12
sessment, climate change due to global warming has 
13
caused, and is expected to continue to cause, sub-
14
stantial interference with and growing losses to 
15
human health and safety, infrastructure, property, 
16
industry, recreation, natural resources, agricultural 
17
systems, and quality of life in the United States. 
18
(6) According to the National Oceanic and At-
19
mospheric Administration, climate change is already 
20
increasing the frequency of extreme weather and 
21
other climate-related disasters, including drought, 
22
wildfire, and storms that include precipitation. 
23
(7) Climate-related natural disasters have in-
24
creased exponentially over the past decade, costing 
25
17:32 Feb 24, 2021
H794
4 
•HR 794 IH
the United States more than double the long-term 
1
average during the period of 2014 through 2018, 
2
with total costs of natural disasters during that pe-
3
riod of approximately $100,000,000,000 per year. 
4
(8) According to the Centers for Disease Con-
5
trol and Prevention, there are wide-ranging, acute, 
6
and fatal public health consequences from climate 
7
change that impact communities across the United 
8
States. 
9
(9) According to the National Climate and 
10
Health Assessment of the United States Global 
11
Change Research Program, climate change is a sig-
12
nificant threat to the health of the people of the 
13
United States, leading to increased— 
14
(A) temperature-related deaths and ill-
15
nesses; 
16
(B) air quality impacts; 
17
(C) extreme weather events; 
18
(D) numbers of vector-borne diseases; 
19
(E) waterborne illnesses; 
20
(F) food safety, nutrition, and distribution 
21
complications; and 
22
(G) mental health and well-being concerns. 
23
(10) The consequences of climate change al-
24
ready disproportionately impact frontline commu-
25

nities and endanger populations made especially vul-
1
nerable by existing exposure to extreme weather 
2
events, such as children, the elderly, and individuals 
3
with pre-existing disabilities and health conditions. 
4
(11) Individuals and families on the frontlines 
5
of climate change across the United States, includ-
6
ing territories, living with income inequality and pov-
7
erty, institutional racism, inequity on the basis of 
8
gender and sexual orientation, poor infrastructure, 
9
and lack of access to health care, housing, clean 
10
water, and food security are often in close proximity 
11
to environmental stressors or sources of pollution, 
12
particularly communities of color, indigenous com-
13
munities, and low-income communities, which— 
14
(A) are often the first exposed to the im-
15
pacts of climate change; 
16
(B) experience outsized risk because of the 
17
close proximity of the community to environ-
18
mental hazards and stressors, in addition to 
19
collocation with waste and other sources of pol-
20
lution; and 
21
(C) have the fewest resources to mitigate 
22
those impacts or to relocate, which will exacer-
23
bate preexisting challenges.

(12) According to Dr. Beverly Wright and Dr. 
1
Robert Bullard, ‘‘environmental and public health 
2
threats from natural and human-made disasters are 
3
not randomly distributed, affecting some commu-
4
nities more than others,’’ and therefore a response 
5
to the climate emergency necessitates the adoption 
6
of policies and processes rooted in principles of ra-
7
cial equity, self-determination, and democracy, as 
8
well as the fundamental human rights of all people 
9
to clean air and water, healthy food, adequate land, 
10
education, and shelter, as promulgated in the 1991 
11
Principles of Environmental Justice. 
12
(13) Climate change holds grave and immediate 
13
consequences not just for the population of the 
14
United States, including territories, but for commu-
15
nities across the world, particularly those commu-
16
nities in the Global South on the frontlines of the 
17
climate crisis that are at risk of forced displacement. 
18
(14) Communities in rural, urban, and subur-
19
ban areas are all dramatically affected by climate 
20
change, though the specific economic, health, social, 
21
and environmental impacts may be different. 
22
(15) The Department of State, the Department 
23
of Defense, and the intelligence community have 
24
identified climate change as a threat to national se-
25
17:32 Feb 24, 2021

•HR 794 IH
curity, and the Department of Homeland Security 
1
views climate change as a top homeland security 
2
risk. 
3
(16) Climate change is a threat multiplier with 
4
the potential— 
5
(A) to exacerbate many of the challenges 
6
the United States already confronts, including 
7
conflicts over scarce resources, conditions con-
8
ducive to violent extremism, and the spread of 
9
infectious diseases; and 
10
(B) to produce new, unforeseeable chal-
11
lenges in the future. 
12
(17) The United Nations Intergovernmental 
13
Panel on Climate Change projected in 2018 that the 
14
Earth could warm 1.5 degrees Celsius above 
15
preindustrial levels as early as 2030. 
16
(18) The climatic changes resulting from global 
17
warming 
above 
1.5 
degrees 
Celsius 
above 
18
preindustrial levels, including changes resulting from 
19
global warming of more than 2 degrees Celsius 
20
above preindustrial levels, are projected to result in 
21
irreversible, catastrophic changes to public health, 
22
livelihoods, quality of life, food security, water sup-
23
plies, human security, and economic growth.

•HR 794 IH
(19) The United Nations Intergovernmental 
1
Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Eco-
2
system Services found in 2019 that human-induced 
3
climate change is pushing the planet toward the 
4
sixth mass species extinction, which threatens the 
5
food security, water supply, and well-being of billions 
6
of people. 
7
(20) According to climate scientists, limiting 
8
global warming to not more than 1.5 degrees Celsius 
9
above preindustrial levels, and likely lower, is most 
10
likely to avoid irreversible and catastrophic climate 
11
change. 
12
(21) Even with global warming up to 1.5 de-
13
grees Celsius above preindustrial levels, the planet is 
14
projected to experience— 
15
(A) a significant rise in sea levels; 
16
(B) extraordinary loss of biodiversity; and 
17
(C) intensifying droughts, floods, wildfires, 
18
and other extreme weather events. 
19
(22) According to climate scientists, addressing 
20
the climate emergency will require an economically 
21
just phase-out of the use of oil, gas, and coal in 
22
order to keep the carbon that is the primary con-
23
stituent of fossil fuels in the ground and out of the 
24
atmosphere.

•HR 794 IH
(23) The United Nations Intergovernmental 
1
Panel on Climate Change has determined that lim-
2
iting warming through emissions reduction and car-
3
bon sequestration will require rapid and immediate 
4
acceleration and proliferation of ‘‘far-reaching, 
5
multilevel, and cross-sectoral climate mitigation’’ 
6
and ‘‘transitions in energy, land, urban and rural in-
7
frastructure (including transport and buildings), and 
8
industrial systems’’. 
9
(24) In the United States, massive, comprehen-
10
sive, and urgent governmental action is required im-
11
mediately to achieve the transitions of those systems 
12
in response to the severe existing and projected eco-
13
nomic, social, public health, and national security 
14
threats posed by the climate crisis. 
15
(25) The massive scope and scale of action nec-
16
essary to stabilize the climate will require unprece-
17
dented levels of public awareness, engagement, and 
18
deliberation to develop and implement effective, just, 
19
and equitable policies to address the climate crisis. 
20
(26) The Constitution of the United States pro-
21
tects the fundamental rights to life, liberty, property, 
22
and equal protection of the laws. 
23
(27) A climate system capable of sustaining 
24
human life is fundamental to a free and ordered so-

ciety, and is preservative of fundamental rights, in-
1
cluding the rights to life, liberty, property, personal 
2
security, family autonomy, bodily integrity, and the 
3
ability to learn, practice, and transmit cultural and 
4
religious traditions. 
5
(28) The United States has a proud history of 
6
collaborative, constructive, massive-scale Federal 
7
mobilizations of resources and labor in order to solve 
8
great challenges, such as the Interstate Highway 
9
System, the Apollo 11 Moon landing, Reconstruc-
10
tion, the New Deal, and World War II. 
11
(29) The United States stands uniquely poised 
12
to substantially grow the economy and attain social 
13
and health benefits from a massive mobilization of 
14
resources and labor that far outweigh the costs cli-
15
mate change will inflict as a result of inaction. 
16
(30) Millions of middle class jobs can be created 
17
by raising labor standards through project labor 
18
agreements and protecting and expanding the right 
19
of workers to organize so that workers in the United 
20
States and the communities of those workers are 
21
guaranteed a strong, viable economic future in a 
22
zero-emissions economy that guarantees good jobs at 
23
fair union wages with quality benefits.

(31) Frontline communities, Tribal govern-
1
ments and communities, people of color, and labor 
2
unions must be equitably and actively engaged in the 
3
climate mobilization, in such a way that aligns with 
4
the 1996 Jemez Principles of Democratic Orga-
5
nizing, and prioritized through local climate mitiga-
6
tion and adaptation planning, policy, and program 
7
delivery so that workers in the United States, and 
8
the communities of those workers, are guaranteed a 
9
strong, viable economic future. 
10
(32) A number of local jurisdictions and gov-
11
ernments in the United States, including New York 
12
City and Los Angeles, and across the world, includ-
13
ing the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, 
14
Portugal, and Canada, have already declared a cli-
15
mate emergency, and a number of State and local 
16
governments are considering declaring a climate 
17
emergency. 
18
(33) State, local, and Tribal governments must 
19
be supported in efforts to hold to account those 
20
whose activities have deepened and accelerated the 
21
climate crisis and who have benefitted from delayed 
22
action to address the climate change emergency and 
23
to develop a clean energy economy.

(34) A collaborative response to the climate cri-
1
sis will require the Federal Government to work with 
2
international, State, and local governments, includ-
3
ing with those governments that have declared a cli-
4
mate emergency, to reverse the impacts of the cli-
5
mate crisis. 
6
(35) The United States has an obligation, as a 
7
primary driver of accelerated climate change, to mo-
8
bilize at emergency speed to restore a safe climate 
9
and environment not just for communities of the 
10
United States but for communities across the world,

particularly those on the frontlines of the climate
