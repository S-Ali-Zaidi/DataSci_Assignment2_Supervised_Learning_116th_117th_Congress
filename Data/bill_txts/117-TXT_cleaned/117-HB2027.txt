A BILL 
To direct Federal science agencies and the Office of Science 
and Technology Policy to undertake activities to improve 
the quality of undergraduate STEM education and en-
hance the research capacity at the Nation’s HBCUs, 
TCUs, and MSIs, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘MSI STEM Achieve-

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress makes the following findings:

H2027

•HR 2027 IH
(1) Evidence suggests that the supply of STEM 
1
workers is not keeping pace with the rapidly evolving 
2
needs of the public and private sector, resulting in 
3
a deficit often referred to as a STEM skills short-
4
age. 
5
(2) According to the Bureau of Labor Statis-
6
tics, the United States will need one million addi-
7
tional STEM professionals than it is on track to 
8
produce in the coming decade. 
9
(3) STEM occupations offer higher wages, more 
10
opportunities for advancement, and a higher degree 
11
of job security than non-STEM occupations. 
12
(4) The composition of the STEM workforce 
13
does not reflect the current or projected diversity of 
14
the Nation, with Hispanics, African Americans, and 
15
other racial and ethnic minorities, significantly 
16
underrepresented in the STEM workforce compared 
17
to their presence in the workforce more generally. 
18
(5) A stronger national commitment to increas-
19
ing the diversity of the STEM workforce is needed 
20
to help address the STEM skills shortage. 
21
(6) According to a 2019 National Academies of 
22
Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine report entitled 
23
‘‘Minority Serving Institutions: America’s Underuti-
24
lized Resource for Strengthening the STEM Work-

force’’, 2- and 4-year minority serving institutions 
1
enroll nearly 30 percent of all undergraduate stu-
2
dents—a percentage that is expected to grow in the 
3
coming years—in the United States higher education 
4
system and play a critical role in providing impor-
5
tant pathways to STEM-related education, training, 
6
and careers for students of color. 
7
(7) HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs are highly suc-
8
cessful at educating underrepresented minority stu-
9
dents in STEM fields and can serve as best practice 
10
models for other colleges and universities to further 
11
expand participation of underrepresented minorities 
12
in the STEM workforce. 
13
(8) Increased investment in STEM infrastruc-
14
ture at HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs has the potential 
15
to increase these institutions’ ability to educate even 
16
more students in the STEM disciplines. 
17
(9) With the demand for STEM skills exceeding 
18
the supply of STEM graduates, success of HBCUs, 
19
TCUs, and MSIs in educating and training science 
20
and engineering leaders is increasingly important for 
21
United States economic growth and competitiveness.
