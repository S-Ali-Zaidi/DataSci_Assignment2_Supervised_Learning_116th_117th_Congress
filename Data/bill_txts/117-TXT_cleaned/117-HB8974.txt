Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Payments Moderniza-

tion Act of 2022’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. 
6
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Families in the United States spend billions 
8
of dollars in overdraft fees in part because they are

waiting for checks to clear over a weekend or holi-
1
day. 
2
(2) The inefficient payment system in the 
3
United States drives families, especially those living 
4
paycheck to paycheck, to use high-cost financial 
5
services to access funds more rapidly. 
6
(3) A faster payment system would provide peo-
7
ple of the United States immediate access to funds 
8
and relief for those who overdraw their accounts be-
9
cause their deposits are not available in real-time, 
10
helping families potentially save billions of dollars 
11
each year. 
12
(4) The United States lags behind other coun-
13
tries in the speed and efficiency of its payment sys-
14
tem. 
15
(5) Central banks around the world have al-
16
ready implemented real-time payment systems, in-
17
cluding in the United Kingdom, Australia, Mexico, 
18
Poland, Japan, and South Africa. 
19
(6) The Federal Reserve System was created by 
20
Congress on December 24, 1913, in response to the 
21
financial panic of 1907. 
22
(7) Since its beginning, the Federal Reserve 
23
System has played a crucial role in the payment sys-
24
tem of the United States.

(8) The role of the Federal Reserve System in 
1
providing payment services is— 
2
(A) to promote the integrity and efficiency 
3
of the payment mechanism; and 
4
(B) to ensure the provision of payment 
5
services to all depository institutions on an eq-
6
uitable basis and in an atmosphere of competi-
7
tive fairness. 
8
(9) The Monetary Control Act of 1980 (title I 
9
of Public Law 96–221; 94 Stat. 132) provided the 
10
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
11
with the authority to oversee the payment system in 
12
the United States. 
13
(10) The Expedited Funds Availability Act (12 
14
U.S.C. 4001 et seq.), enacted on August 10, 1987, 
15
provided the Board of Governors of the Federal Re-
16
serve System with full authority to regulate all as-
17
pects of the payment system, including the receipt, 
18
payment, collection, clearing of checks, and related 
19
functions of the payment system pertaining to 
20
checks. 
21
(11) In a July 2018 report on financial tech-
22
nology, the Department of the Treasury acknowl-
23
edged the important role of the Board of Governors 
24
of the Federal Reserve System in bringing real-time

•HR 8974 IH
payment settlement services to the United States 
1
when the Department recommended the Board of 
2
Governors work to facilitate a faster retail payment 
3
system, in particular, for smaller financial institu-
4
tions such as community banks and credit unions, 
5
noting that such institutions should also have the 
6
ability to access the most innovative technologies 
7
and payment services. 
8
(12) The authorities described in paragraphs 
9
(9) and (10) are more critical than ever given how 
10
the financial services sector has been defined as a 
11
vital component of critical infrastructure in the 
12
United States. 
13
(13) The role of the Board of Governors of the 
14
Federal Reserve System in the financial services sec-
15
tor will ensure the resiliency of the payment system 
16
in the United States. 
17
(14) The Board of Governors of the Federal 
18
Reserve System should develop a real-time interbank 
19
payment system to ensure that— 
20
(A) consumers are prioritized; 
21
(B) consumers and small businesses are 
22
protected from fraud and errors, including with 
23
respect to a payment initiated by a consumer or 
24
small business;

(C) the payment system is open to in-
1
creased competition; and 
2
(D) outsized entities do not monopolize the 
3
financial infrastructure of the United States. 
4
(b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this Act are— 
5
(1) to ensure that the United States has a safe, 
6
fast, efficient, equitable, and fair payment system; 
7
(2) to clarify that the Board of Governors of 
8
the Federal Reserve System has the existing author-
9
ity to build a real-time payment system; and 
10
(3) to make certain that the Board of Gov-
11
ernors of the Federal Reserve System follows 
12
through on implementing the system described in 
13
paragraph (2).
