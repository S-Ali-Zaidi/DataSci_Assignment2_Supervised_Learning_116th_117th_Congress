RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the United States should support the expansion of do-
mestic nuclear energy and advanced nuclear technology 
as a viable source of power in order to promote United 
States nuclear energy leadership and global energy inde-
pendence. 
Whereas nuclear energy has generated one-fifth of the elec-
tricity used in the United States since 1990; 
Whereas the Secretary of Energy has stated that, ‘‘nuclear 
energy is clean energy and it is vital to creating good-

our planet’’; 
Whereas the International Energy Agency determined that 
nuclear power forms the cornerstone of zero-carbon elec-
tricity generation; 
Whereas conventional nuclear energy plants are highly reli-
able and consistently operate over 92 percent of the time; 
Whereas the generation of electricity from nuclear energy is 
up to 2 times more reliable than the generation of elec-
tricity from natural gas and coal, and up to 3.5 times 
more reliable than the generation of electricity from wind 
and solar; 
Whereas nuclear reactors produce substantially more energy 
relative to their land footprint than solar and wind 
projects, which require over 30 times and 100 times, re-
spectfully, the land area for the same generating capac-
ity; 
Whereas, in 2019, 476,000,000 metric tons of greenhouse 
gas emissions were not released into the atmosphere due 
to the utilization of nuclear energy in the United States, 
which is equivalent to removing 100,000,000 cars off the 
road; 
Whereas conversely, in 2014, Vermont’s Yankee Nuclear 
Plant closed and the State saw a 650,000-metric ton in-
crease in carbon dioxide emissions within just 2 months; 
Whereas electricity demand throughout the United States is 
predicted to increase by approximately 34 percent by 
2050; 
Whereas, as of July 8, 2020, there are 28 States in which 
at least 1 commercial nuclear reactor operates;

Whereas many States around the United States have enacted 
nuclear energy-related laws and are in the process of 
adopting policies and appropriating funding for the ex-
pansion of nuclear energy in their State; 
Whereas nuclear energy facilities can easily repurpose retired 
fossil fuel power plants by using existing infrastructure 
and transitioning fossil fuel power plant workers that al-
ready understand the basics of the plant to easily operate 
the nuclear energy facility; 
Whereas, in 2022, nuclear energy supports over 475,000 jobs 
in the United States; 
Whereas building a conventional nuclear reactor employs up 
to 7,000 workers at peak construction; 
Whereas nuclear energy worker salaries are, on average, 50 
percent higher than the salaries of employees that work 
in other electricity generation facilities; 
Whereas the United States nuclear energy industry spends 
roughly $11,000,000,000 annually on labor, which is ap-
proximately $100,000,000 per reactor per year; 
Whereas, for every 100 jobs at a nuclear power plant in the 
United States, 66 other jobs are created in the local com-
munity; 
Whereas nearly 1 in 4 nuclear energy workers are veterans; 
Whereas nuclear energy adds approximately $60,000,000,000 
to the United States gross domestic product each year; 
Whereas, unlike most energy sources, nuclear power plants 
have up to 2 years of fuel stored securely on-site, which 
makes nuclear power plants hardened against fuel-related 
supply disruptions;

Whereas a uranium pellet the size of a pencil eraser contains 
the same amount of energy as 17,000 cubic feet of nat-
ural gas, 1,780 pounds of coal, or 149 gallons of oil; 
Whereas global uranium supply is vastly available and the 
United States can generate nuclear power at its current 
levels for more than a century with just the natural ura-
nium ore deposits that have already been identified; 
Whereas nuclear power plants offer a level of protection 
against natural and adversarial threats that goes far be-
yond most other elements of the electrical grid in the 
United States; 
Whereas nuclear power plants’ infrastructure and facilities 
are built to withstand extreme weather, as proven during 
recent hurricanes and freezing temperatures driven by 
polar vortex events; 
Whereas the safe operation of nuclear energy in the United 
States has resulted in no radiation-related deaths or long- 
term evacuation of surrounding communities; 
Whereas the utilization of conventional and advanced nuclear 
energy technologies will significantly reduce energy costs, 
although the initial investment burden of licensing and 
constructing any type of nuclear reactor will be substan-
tial; 
Whereas the production of nuclear energy has become a much 
safer and more efficient process with the development 
and commercialization of innovative advanced nuclear re-
actors; 
Whereas advanced nuclear reactors present uniquely innova-
tive options for the sustainable generation of clean energy 
in the United States and around the world;

Whereas a typical 1,000-megawatt nuclear power plant in the 
United States requires a little more than one square mile 
to operate, however an advanced nuclear reactor requires 
about 3 times less land area compared to a conventional 
nuclear power plant, depending on the reactor type and 
the specific characteristics of the community; 
Whereas the Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulates 31 re-
search and test reactors; 
Whereas approximately 98 universities in the United States 
offer a nuclear engineering program and several univer-
sities have expressed interest in advanced nuclear reac-
tors as a power source for their campuses; 
Whereas more than 45 companies and research organizations 
across the United States have advanced nuclear energy 
projects underway; 
Whereas many advanced nuclear reactors, in comparison to 
conventional nuclear reactors, can operate at much high-
er temperatures without water, have built-in safety fea-
tures (such as automatic shutoff mechanisms), can oper-
ate autonomously without disruption for several years at 
a time, and have a naturally enhanced resistance to nu-
clear proliferation; 
Whereas low-emission heat and steam from advanced nuclear 
reactors can supply reliable, clean energy for hard-to- 
decarbonize sectors, such as the industrial sector and 
chemical production sector; 
Whereas the total amount of spent nuclear fuel that the 
United States nuclear energy industry produced over the 
past 60 years could fit within the bounds of a football 
field at a depth of less than 10 yards; 
Whereas spent nuclear fuel can—

•HRES 1311 IH 
(1) be safely stored in a deep geological repository; 
(2) be repurposed and recycled using innovative 
technology; and 
(3) potentially be safely stored underground using 
techniques such as deep borehole drilling; 
Whereas certain advanced nuclear reactors have the capa-
bility to use spent nuclear fuel from another nuclear reac-
tor as a fuel source; 
Whereas recycling spent nuclear fuel could significantly re-
duce the burden of storing spent nuclear fuel, which 
would make the nuclear fuel cycle more sustainable and 
further reduce the already-low carbon footprint of nuclear 
energy; 
Whereas 96 percent of spent nuclear fuel content is reusable 
energy, and recycling spent nuclear fuel can cut the use 
of natural uranium resources by 25 percent, reduce the 
volume of high-level waste slated for disposal by 75 per-
cent, and reduce the waste’s toxicity by approximately 90 
percent; 
Whereas, by 2050, energy produced by advanced nuclear re-
actors may account for a significant amount of the clean 
energy generated in the United States, with certain esti-
mates predicting that up to 50 percent of total United 
States electricity generation could come from conven-
tional and advanced nuclear energy sources; 
Whereas the offsite component fabrication and modular man-
ufacturing process for advanced nuclear reactors will like-
ly lead to cheaper and faster installation, reduced regu-
latory burdens, and ultimately a streamlined commercial 
deployment of advanced nuclear reactors;

Whereas advanced nuclear reactors offer seamless integration 
to complement other renewables within microgrids, bal-
ancing out variations in generation over time to reliably 
meet United States electricity demand; 
Whereas, in the aftermath of a natural disaster when power 
outages persist, an easily transportable advanced nuclear 
reactor could provide electricity or heat for essential serv-
ices, such as hospitals and water purification facilities, 
instead of diesel generators, thereby producing a cleaner 
and more efficient source of power that can last up to 20 
years without refueling; 
Whereas nuclear medicine, including the use of medical radio-
active isotopes, can be used to diagnose and treat dif-
ferent diseases with pinpoint precision, which will ulti-
mately save American lives; 
Whereas the Armed Forces have intentions to utilize ad-
vanced nuclear reactors at United States military bases, 
both domestically and internationally, because of ad-
vanced nuclear reactor’s ability to generate clean elec-
tricity consistently and reliably in locations that experi-
ence severe weather patterns; 
Whereas the Armed Forces are currently using diesel for gen-
erators in these remote locations to provide electricity, 
such as in Alaska, which require refueling approximately 
every 72 hours; 
Whereas, since 1954, the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program 
has maintained and operated more than 100 naval nu-
clear reactors, serviced and supplied by thousands of

pulsion provides an alternative clean energy source to 
power commercial ships to cut emissions and remove the 
costly refueling infrastructure needs for liquid-based en-
ergy carriers;

and nuclear electric propulsion include long refueling in-
tervals, faster transit speeds, production of heat or cool-
ing for cargo, faster turn-around times due to elimination 
of refueling, reduced draft allowing increased cargo ca-
pacity, eliminating the need to transport huge quantities 
of engine fuel, and reducing the probability of environ-
mental damage from fuel leakages; 
Whereas nuclear thermal propulsion and nuclear electric pro-
pulsion vehicles are to be made at one-third to one-half 
the size of comparable chemical propulsion vehicles, 
which would increase travel speeds and cut costs of space 
missions; 
Whereas the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
and private companies are creating technologies that use 
advanced nuclear radioisotopes to channel heat into elec-
tricity, even in temperatures below -280 oF on the lunar 
surface, for both manned and unmanned missions to 
Earth’s satellites, the Earth’s Moon, Mars, and deep 
space; 
Whereas nuclear energy may be used to desalinate highly 
salty waters and industrial wastewater to ultimately
