RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for naming surviving family members 
of veterans who die by suicide as ‘‘Gold Arrow Families’’. 
Whereas a veteran’s past exposure to combat and high-stress 
environments can be associated with higher rates of men-
tal health diagnoses, such as depression, anxiety dis-
orders, and post-traumatic stress disorder; 
Whereas rates of these conditions and disorders among vet-
erans have risen steadily; 
Whereas when a veteran commits suicide, close family mem-
bers of the veteran often experience shock, anger, guilt, 
and sorrow; 
Whereas it is important to remember stories like that of 
Army Specialist Ashley M. Taylor and her husband Army

Private Bailey C. Taylor, who both died by suicide leav-
ing behind their son shortly after his second birthday; 
Whereas increased recognition of veterans and their family 
members within the community and increased screening 
for suicide risk should be required among Federal agen-
cies, State and local governments, other organizations, 
communities, and individuals; 
Whereas the response of the Department of Veterans Affairs 
to veterans’ suicidal thoughts, attempts, and deaths 
should involve coordinated efforts among family mem-
bers, medical professionals, counselors, and others across 
the veteran community; 
Whereas Congress has attempted to address the problem of 
suicide among veterans through legislation and oversight 
hearings, both on prevention of veteran suicide and vet-
eran mental health, and increased annual funding for 
Veterans Health Administration mental health care and 
behavior health services; and 
Whereas while some legislation has sought to improve out-
reach and awareness, particularly among certain veteran 
communities deemed to be at high risk for suicide, cer-
tain challenges remain, and more can be done for the 
grieving families that are commonly forgotten about: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the naming of surviving family 
2
members of veterans who die by suicide as ‘‘Gold 
3
Arrow Families’’;
