To criminalize transnational repression, and for other 
purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Stop Transnational

Repression Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 9460 IH
(1) Transnational repression is not currently 
1
codified or defined in United States law. 
2
(2) The Federal Bureau of Investigation defines 
3
transnational repression as foreign government 
4
transgression of national borders through physical 
5
and digital means to intimidate, silence, coerce, har-
6
ass, or harm members of diaspora and exile commu-
7
nities. Transnational repression is often used to si-
8
lence individuals who oppose or are critical of a gov-
9
ernment, including journalists, human rights defend-
10
ers, religious or ethnic minority groups, and political 
11
opponents. Methods of transnational repression are 
12
known to include physical and digital stalking, har-
13
assment, computer hacking, criminal threats, as-
14
saults, attempted kidnappings, coerced repatriation, 
15
and detaining family members in the home country. 
16
(3) Transnational repression is not limited to 
17
physical acts of intimidation and harassment. Ac-
18
cording to Citizen Lab, ‘‘digital transnational repres-
19
sion’’ tools are used to facilitate government reach 
20
beyond borders to gain access to social media and 
21
email accounts, including through phishing attacks, 
22
zero-click spyware hacks, social media page take-
23
downs, SIM card hacks, and fake invitations to con-
24
ferences. For human rights activists and dissidents,

this has a serious impact on their advocacy work 
1
and sense of security, even if they have relocated to 
2
escape physical intimidation. 
3
(4) On February 23, 2022, the National Secu-
4
rity Division of the Department of Justice launched 
5
a ‘‘Strategy for Countering Nation-State Threats’’ 
6
in order to take a comprehensive, ‘‘whole-of-govern-
7
ment’’ approach to addressing threats the United 
8
States 
faces 
from 
hostile 
nations, 
including 
9
transnational repression. 
10
(5) Throughout 2022, the Department of Jus-
11
tice has charged a number of individuals with stalk-
12
ing, harassing, and spying, who allegedly perpetrated 
13
transnational repression to silence United States 
14
residents who were critics of the People’s Republic 
15
of China. 
16
(6) Transnational repression is a growing prob-
17
lem. As of August 2022, Freedom House has docu-
18
mented 735 direct, physical cases of transnational 
19
repression that took place between 2014 and 2021. 
20
(7) A total of 85 new incidents of transnational 
21
repression were recorded around the globe in 2021. 
22
Four governments, Algeria, Belarus, Comoros, and 
23
Nigeria, attacked exiles abroad for the first time last 
24
year, bringing the total number of states engaged in 
25
05:18 Dec 15, 2022

•HR 9460 IH
transnational repression to 36. The number of host 
1
countries, or countries where acts of transnational 
2
repression took place, rose from 79 to 84, including 
3
the United States. 
4
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
5
It is the sense of Congress that hostile nations and 
6
authoritarian regimes have increasingly and aggressively 
7
targeted individuals in the United States. Agents of these 
8
governments have acted outside diplomatic channels to 
9
threaten, intimidate, harass, surveil, stalk, silence, and 
10
even plot to physically harm or kidnap persons within U.S. 
11
borders. Although transnational repression often involves 
12
actions that are already prohibited by U.S. law, their for-
13
eign government backing render these activities more egre-
14
gious than the underlying acts of intimidation or harass-
15
ment alone. Therefore, it is necessary to formally define 
16
and criminalize transnational repression in Federal law, 
17
and more actively track and report on instances 
18
transnational repression in the United States.
