(2) Gandhi led the Indian people to independ-
1
ence from British rule in August 1947 through non- 
2
violent means, staging massive peaceful demonstra-
3
tions against poverty while supporting women’s 
4
rights and religious tolerance. 
5
(3) Gandhi’s legacy has inspired hundreds of 
6
millions of people around the world to pursue non- 
7
violence as a means to achieve freedom and equality, 
8
including Martin Luther King, Jr.’s movement to 
9
end racial injustice in the United States and Nelson 
10
Mandela’s fight to end apartheid in South Africa. 
11
(4) For his efforts, Gandhi was given the title 
12
of Mahatma, or ‘‘Great Soul’’ and was often called 
13
Bapu in India, which means ‘‘father’’. 
14
(5) Over 2,000,000 people attended Gandhi’s 
15
funeral and his memory and teachings persist still 
16
today. 
17
(6) October 2, Gandhi’s birthday was declared 
18
as International Day of Non-Violence by the United 
19
Nations to ‘‘disseminate the message of non-violence, 
20
including through education and public awareness’’ 
21
and reaffirm ‘‘the universal relevance of the prin-
22
ciple of non-violence’’ and desire ‘‘to secure a culture 
23
of peace, tolerance, and understanding through non- 
24
violence’’.

(7) Ensuring that people around the globe know 
1
about, understand, and adopt Gandhi’s principles of 
2
ahimsa (non-violence), satyagraha (appeal to, insist-
3
ence on, or reliance on the Truth), and swaraj (self- 
4
rule) are more important than ever.
