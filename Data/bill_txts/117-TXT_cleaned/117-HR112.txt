RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of Congress that February 11, 2021, 
be observed as the 6th annual International Day of 
Women and Girls in Science. 
Whereas the International Day of Women and Girls in 
Science was established in 2015 by the United Nations 
General Assembly and formalized as February 11 each 
year; 
Whereas the annual recognition of International Day of 
Women and Girls in Science on February 11 allows us 
to honor women’s significant achievements in scientific 
fields; 
Whereas the International Day of Women and Girls in 
Science places a much-needed focus on women and girls

currently studying and working in Science, Technology, 
Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) careers; 
Whereas, in 2019, just 30 percent of researchers worldwide 
were women, and only 35 percent of all students enrolled 
in STEM-related studies are women; 
Whereas, in the United States, women earned less than half 
of degrees in most STEM fields (46.3 percent associate’s, 
49.4 percent bachelor’s, 43.6 percent master’s, 45.2 per-
cent doctoral), less than a quarter of all degrees in engi-
neering, but half to three-quarters of all degrees in bio-
logical sciences, psychology, and social sciences, and ac-
count for just 29 percent of the science and engineering 
workforce; 
Whereas long-standing biases, discrimination, and gender 
stereotypes steered and continue to influence girls and 
women away from science-related fields; 
Whereas despite this, generations of women have continued 
to lead in scientific discoveries and groundbreaking re-
search; 
Whereas, for centuries, female scientists such as Katherine 
Johnson, Dorothy Vaughn, and Mary Jackson, whose 
stories were told in the movie ‘‘Hidden Figures’’, and 
countless others have made groundbreaking discoveries, 
contributed greatly to the advancement of their fields, 
and inspired a generation of women to follow in their 
footsteps; 
Whereas the United States and 192 other Member States of 
the United Nations unanimously prioritized ending the 
gender gap in education through Sustainable Develop-
ment Goal 4—to ensure inclusive and equitable quality 
education—and the United Nations International Chil-

dren’s Emergency Fund, United Nations Women, and 
the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural 
Organization are working together with countries and the 
private sector to strengthen girls and women participa-
tion in STEM fields, however there is still a long way to 
go; and 
Whereas by elevating the work of women and girls in science, 
we can inspire the next generation of STEM leaders, 
thinkers, and professionals: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) recognizes the significance of the Inter-

3
(2) recognizes the importance of having greater

representation of women in science fields; and

(3) recognizes the groundbreaking contributions

of women in STEM fields, past, present, and future.
