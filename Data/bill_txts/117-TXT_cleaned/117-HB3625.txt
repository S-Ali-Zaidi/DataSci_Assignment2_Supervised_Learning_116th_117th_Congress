promoting trade and commerce, travel, communica-
1
tions, and cultural, academic, and scientific ex-
2
changes; 
3
(2) extension to Cuba of unconditional normal 
4
trade relations treatment would assist Cuba in devel-
5
oping its economy based on free market principles 
6
and becoming competitive in the global marketplace; 
7
(3) expanding bilateral trade relations is likely 
8
to promote further progress in Cuba on human 
9
rights and democratic rule and assist Cuba in adopt-
10
ing regional and world trading rules and principles; 
11
and

(4) Cuba was one of the founding members of 
13
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in 
14
1947 and is an original member of the World Trade 
15
Organization, and extension of unconditional normal 
16
trade relations treatment to Cuba would enable the
