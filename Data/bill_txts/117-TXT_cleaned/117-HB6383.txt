A BILL 
To prohibit the purchase of public or private real estate 
located in the United States by foreign persons, and 
for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘National Security Mor-
4
atorium on Foreign Purchases of U.S. Land’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Foreign investors now account for almost 
8
one-third of institutional investment in single-family

rental homes in the United States. This increases 
1
the price and makes it more difficult for Americans 
2
to purchase a home. 
3
(2) Increased foreign investment in Wash-
4
ington, DC, and other urban areas has led to a rise 
5
in gentrification, pushing many long-time residents 
6
out of their homes, including some of our most vul-
7
nerable and poor communities. 
8
(3) Roughly 47 percent of rural renters pay a 
9
third or more of their income in rent each month. 
10
The Federal Government has done nothing to help 
11
rural Americans deal with the rising costs in hous-
12
ing. 
13
(4) Chinese nationals have led foreign invest-
14
ments in homes in the United States for the past 
15
seven years. The Chinese Communist Party is at-
16
tempting to buy land in the United States, with an 
17
emphasis on farmland to gain strategic leverage over 
18
the United States. 
19
(5) Foreign companies and individuals have 
20
purchased 1.7 million acres of agricultural land in 
21
Texas over the past decade, which is more than in 
22
any other State. The purchases are worth approxi-
23
mately $3.3 billion.

(6) Foreigners have been abusing the EB–5 
1
visa system, which allows foreign nationals to obtain 
2
green cards if they invest in specific business ven-
3
tures. The rules to acquire an EB–5 visa should be 
4
made more stringent. 
5
(7) Current United States laws are designed in 
6
a way that makes it more profitable for foreign in-
7
vestors to invest in property in the United States 
8
than their country of origin. 
9
(8) The Foreign Investment Risk Act of 2018 
10
strengthened the Committee on Foreign Investment 
11
in the United States (CFIUS) by among other meas-
12
ures giving it more jurisdiction over real estate 
13
transactions. Specifically, CFIUS now has jurisdic-
14
tion to review purchases and leases of real estate by 
15
foreign nationals regardless of whether the trans-
16
actions involve United States businesses. More ac-
17
tion is still needed to make the rules of CFIUS more 
18
strict. 
19
(9) With each additional land purchase made by 
20
a foreign national or foreign entity, American sov-
21
ereignty is further eroded.
