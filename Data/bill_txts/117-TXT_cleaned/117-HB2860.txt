To appropriate an additional amount to improve the Navy 
shipyard infrastructure of the United States. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Supplying Help to In-

Act of 2021’’ or the ‘‘SHIPYARD Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress makes the following findings:

•HR 2860 IH
(1) Since the beginning of our Nation, the four 
1
public shipyards that support the United States 
2
Navy have continued to be foundational cornerstones 
3
of the strategic infrastructure of the United States, 
4
and those shipyards will continue to be so in the fu-
5
ture. 
6
(2) Although originally built in the age of sail-
7
ing ships, the shipyards have been incrementally up-
8
dated overtime, but in 2021, are in need of a 
9
generational investment to modernize and upgrade 
10
the outdated facilities to ensure they can continue to 
11
repair the United States Navy for another 200 
12
years. This Act would provide the necessary authori-
13
ties and appropriations to make those strategic as-
14
sets ready to meet the future demands of the United 
15
States, while securing and expanding domestic capa-
16
bilities across many sectors of the economy critical 
17
to ensuring the independence of the United States 
18
from, and preventing over-reliance, on foreign com-
19
merce.

(3) On November 1, 1767, Andrew Sprowle, a 
21
merchant and ship owner, established Gosport Ship-
22
yard on the western shore of the Elizabeth River, in 
23
the Colony of Virginia, under the British flag. The 
24
shipyard developed and prospered as both a naval 
25

•HR 2860 IH
and merchant shipyard, supporting the maritime in-
1
dustry that was critical to the survival of the early 
2
colonies and then to the fledgling United States. 
3
When the American Revolution began, the infra-
4
structure resident at this former colonial shipyard 
5
became a nucleus in the Hampton Roads, Virginia, 
6
area for the United States Navy. For more than 230 
7
years, the Norfolk Naval Shipyard has assisted the 
8
United States in winning nine major wars, putting 
9
an end to piracy, sending the Great White Fleet 
10
around the world, supporting scientific exploration of 
11
the Pacific, and opening Asia to United States 
12
trade. Today, the Norfolk Naval Shipyard conducts 
13
critical maintenance to the Nation’s Nuclear Navy to 
14
include aircraft carriers, ballistic missile submarines, 
15
and fast attack submarines. 
16
(4) On June 12, 1800, under the administra-
17
tion of President John Adams, the Portsmouth 
18
Naval Shipyard was established. The Portsmouth 
19
Naval Shipyard is the United States Navy’s oldest 
20
continuously operating shipyard. In 1776, during the 
21
Revolutionary War, the USS Raleigh was built in 
22
Kittery, Maine, and became the first vessel to fly an 
23
American flag into battle. For more than 221 years, 
24
the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard has contributed to 
25

•HR 2860 IH
the Nation’s security and has been instrumental in 
1
United States diplomacy, when, in 1905, President 
2
Theodore Roosevelt selected the Portsmouth Naval 
3
Shipyard as the location to host the Treaty of Ports-
4
mouth, which ended the Russo-Japanese War. 
5
Today, the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard overhauls, 
6
refuels, and modernizes the Nation’s fast attack sub-
7
marine fleet. 
8
(5) In 1889, Congress approved a budget to 
9
purchase land around Sinclair Inlet in Kitsap Coun-
10
ty, Washington. In 1892, additional land was added 
11
and the United States Navy broke ground for the 
12
construction of the first of six dry-docks that would 
13
form what is now the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. 
14
Since that time, the shipyard was front and center 
15
in supporting the Nation’s efforts in World War I, 
16
World War II, and the Korean War by constructing 
17
submarines, surface ships, and support vessels re-
18
quired to win those wars. In late 1965, the USS 
19
Sculpin (SSN 590) became the first nuclear-powered 
20
submarine worked on at the Puget Sound Naval 
21
Shipyard. The Shipyard site at Naval Base Kitsap- 
22
Bremerton provides longer-term, full-service mainte-
23
nance and inactivation and recycling work on air-

craft carriers, surface ships, and submarines, uti-
1
lizing six drydocks and adjacent piers. 
2
(6) On May 13, 1908, Navy Yard Pearl Harbor 
3
was officially established on the Hawaiian Island of 
4
Oahu, and the Navy Yard has proven to be vital to 
5
the defense of the United States and its interests in 
6
the Asia-Pacific region. The shipyard has been in-
7
strumental in enabling the United States to secure 
8
sea-lanes of communication and commerce that has 
9
strengthened the Nation’s ability to project power 
10
across the expansive Pacific and Indian Oceans. For 
11
generations, the shipyard has supported the global 
12
interests of the United States in a critical geo-
13
graphic region. On December 7, 1941, Pearl Harbor 
14
and the Navy Yard at Pearl Harbor were the scene 
15
of a devastating attack on the United States by the 
16
Imperial Japanese Navy. Despite the devastating at-
17
tack, the shipyard and its workers were able to re-
18
turn ships damaged in the attack back into service 
19
and enabled the United States to win the Pacific 
20
War. For more than 113 years, the Pearl Harbor 
21
Naval Shipyard’s strategic location in the Pacific 
22
has assured the safety and prosperity of the United 
23
States through the maintenance of Navy ships. 
24
Today the shipyard supports the maintenance of the 
25

•HR 2860 IH
Navy’s nuclear submarine fleet as well as surface 
1
ships. 
2
(7) In April 2013, the Navy provided Congress 
3
a public shipyard investment plan, which identified 
4
investments needed to optimize, improve, and rebuild 
5
shipyard facilities, electrical infrastructure, environ-
6
mental systems, and equipment, and needed to im-
7
prove the timely return of ships and submarines 
8
back to the fleet following maintenance and mod-
9
ernization, to support the combat readiness of the 
10
United States. To this end, the Navy developed the 
11
Shipyard 
Infrastructure 
Optimization 
Program, 
12
which is a comprehensive, 20-year, $21,000,000,000 
13
effort to modernize infrastructure at the four naval 
14
shipyards through— 
15
(A) performing critical dry dock repairs; 
16
(B) restoring and optimally placing ship-
17
yard facilities; and 
18
(C) replacing aging and deteriorating cap-
19
ital equipment. 
20
(8) In addition to the Nation’s public shipyards, 
21
the United States continues to rely on the capacity 
22
and capabilities of private new construction and re-
23
pair shipyards to meet the strategic maritime needs 
24
of the United States Navy, the United States Coast

Guard, and the Nation’s maritime industry. Such 
1
shipyards, located on every coast of the United 
2
States, also require substantial recapitalization and 
3
reconfiguration in order to meet the construction 
4
and sustainment requirements of our maritime Na-
5
tion. This Act recognizes the vital role such private 
6
shipyards play in the United States and accordingly 
7
authorizes and appropriates funds to ensure they are 
8
able to continue to provide those strategic capabili-
9
ties in the future.
