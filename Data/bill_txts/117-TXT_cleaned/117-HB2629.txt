•HR 2629 IH
(1) the American Bar Association has urged the 
1
Federal Government to take legislative action to cur-
2
tail the availability and effectiveness of the ‘‘gay 
3
panic’’ and ‘‘trans panic’’ defenses, which seek to 
4
partially or completely excuse crimes such as murder 
5
and assault on the grounds that the sexual orienta-
6
tion or gender identity of the victim is provocation 
7
enough for the violent reaction of the defendant; 
8
(2) gay and trans panic legal defenses, which 
9
continue to be raised in criminal proceedings in Fed-
10
eral courts across the United States, are surprisingly 
11
long-lived historical artifacts, remnants of a time 
12
when widespread public antipathy was the norm for 
13
lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (re-
14
ferred to in this Act as ‘‘LGBTQ’’) individuals; 
15
(3) gay and trans panic defenses characterize 
16
sexual orientation and gender identity as objectively 
17
reasonable excuses for loss of self-control, and there-
18
by illegitimately mitigate the responsibility of a per-
19
petrator for harm done to LGBTQ individuals; 
20
(4) gay and trans panic defenses appeal to irra-
21
tional fears and hatred of LGBTQ individuals, 
22
thereby undermining the legitimacy of Federal crimi-
23
nal prosecutions and resulting in unjustifiable ac-
24
quittals or sentencing reductions;

•HR 2629 IH
(5) the use of gay and trans panic defenses is 
1
entirely incompatible with the express intent of Fed-
2
eral law to provide increased protection to victims of 
3
bias-motivated crimes, including crimes committed 
4
against LGBTQ individuals; 
5
(6) continued use of these anachronistic de-
6
fenses reinforces and institutionalizes prejudice at 
7
the expense of norms of self-control, tolerance, and 
8
compassion, which the law should encourage, and 
9
marks an egregious lapse in the march of the United 
10
States toward a more just criminal justice system; 
11
and 
12
(7) to end the antiquated notion that LGBTQ 
13
lives are worth less than others and to reflect mod-
14
ern understanding of LGBTQ individuals as equal 
15
citizens under law, gay and trans panic defenses 
16
must end.
