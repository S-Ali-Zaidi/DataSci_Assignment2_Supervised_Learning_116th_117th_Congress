RESOLUTION 
Seeking the return of the USS Pueblo to the United States 
Navy. 
Whereas the USS Pueblo was hijacked in international waters 
by the navy of North Korea unprovoked on January 23, 
1968, in violation of maritime law, marking the first time 
a ship of the United States Navy was attacked and cap-
tured on the high seas in 150 years; 
Whereas Petty Officer Duane Hodges was murdered in the 
violent 
assault, 
while 
the 
other 
82 
American 
servicemembers were held in captivity, under inhumane 
conditions, for just shy of an entire year thereafter; 
Whereas the criminal siege of the USS Pueblo resulted in no 
reprisals against North Korea and no retaliatory military 
action taken at any time; and
