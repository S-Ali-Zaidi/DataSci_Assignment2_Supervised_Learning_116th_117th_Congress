cent of students in the United States have money in a

wealth;

ensure that individuals are prepared—

hold, investors, entrepreneurs, business leaders, and citi-
zens;

make wise financial decisions and reduces the confusion 
caused by an increasingly complex economy;

nancial markets and institutions will lead to increased 
economic activity and growth; and 
Whereas, in 2003, Congress—

literacy efforts and formulating a national strategy is im-
portant; and

cial Literacy and Education Improvement Act (20 U.S.C. 
9701 et seq.), establishing the Financial Literacy and
