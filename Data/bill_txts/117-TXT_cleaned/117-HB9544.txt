•HR 9544 IH
(1) In the United States, 27 percent of women 
1
and 11 percent of men experience some form of 
2
physical violence or stalking by an intimate partner. 
3
(2) Many victims of intimate partner violence 
4
also experience nonphysical forms of abuse. 
5
(3) With the proliferation of digital technology, 
6
technological abuse has become increasingly preva-
7
lent and pervasive among victims of intimate partner 
8
violence. 
9
(4) According to a 2021 study by the National 
10
Network to End Domestic Violence, 97 percent of 
11
the programs providing support to victims of inti-
12
mate partner violence have indicated that abusers 
13
are making use of technology to stalk, harass, or 
14
control victims. 
15
(5) In the United States, 1 in 3 women under 
16
the age of 35 report being sexually harassed online, 
17
and over half of lesbian, gay, and bisexual individ-
18
uals report being the target of online abuse based on 
19
their sexual orientation or gender. 
20
(6) Of victims who are stalked using tech-
21
nology— 
22
(A) 67 percent received unwanted phone 
23
calls, voice messages, or text messages; 
24

•HR 9544 IH
(B) 50 percent received unwanted emails 
1
or messages via the internet; 
2
(C) about 35 percent said their activities 
3
were monitored using social media; 
4
(D) 27 percent experienced the offender 
5
posting or threatening to post inappropriate, 
6
unwanted, or personal information about them 
7
on the internet; and 
8
(E) 19 percent said the offender spied on 
9
them or monitored their activities using tech-
10
nologies such as listening devices, cameras, or 
11
computer or cellphone monitoring software. 
12
(7) Technological abuse runs the gamut of tech-
13
nical sophistication, from the most basic social 
14
media platforms and phone-based apps to specialty 
15
stalkerware apps, demonstrating that technological 
16
abuse does not require huge financial resources or 
17
complex knowledge of technology. 
18
(8) Rapid advances in the technology and meth-
19
ods for technological abuse present challenges for 
20
advocates seeking to advise victims and prevent tech-
21
nological abuse. 
22
(9) The integration of trained technology ex-
23
perts into survivor support networks has been suc-
