SEC. 2. FINDING; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
1
(a) FINDING.—Congress finds that exports of lique-
2
fied natural gas from the United States to Europe have 
3
a lifecycle emissions profile that is 41 percent lower than 
4
natural gas that is exported from the Russian Federation 
5
to Europe. 
6
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
7
gress that— 
8
(1) any prohibition on the importation of fossil 
9
fuels, including crude oil, petroleum, petroleum prod-
10
ucts, liquefied natural gas, and coal, from the Rus-
11
sian Federation must be offset by an increase in the 
12
production of those fossil fuels in the United States; 
13
(2) United States allies in Europe should take 
14
similar steps to prohibit the importation of Russian 
15
fossil fuels so that the Russian Federation cannot 
16
benefit from production of those fossil fuels; and 
17
(3) energy independence is critical to national 
18
security and should include the production, use, and 
19
export of all available energy sources, including coal, 
20
natural gas, oil, nuclear, and renewables, as well as 
21
strategic minerals critical to electric vehicles and 
22
other clean energy sources.
