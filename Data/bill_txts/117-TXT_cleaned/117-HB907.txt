•HR 907 IH
(1) According to the Bureau of Justice Statis-
1
tics, African Americans are more likely to have face- 
2
to-face contact with law enforcement and are 2.5 
3
times more likely to experience a threat or use of 
4
nonfatal force by police. 
5
(2) Research shows that young men who have 
6
experienced these law enforcement practices display 
7
higher levels of stress, anxiety, and trauma associ-
8
ated with the interaction. 
9
(3) Witnessing or experiencing invasive encoun-
10
ters with law enforcement can also be an everyday 
11
stressor for racial and ethnic minorities, leading to 
12
physiological and psychological strain. 
13
(4) Racial and ethnic minorities face inequities 
14
in accessing mental health services. 
15
(5) Addressing the stigma in some communities 
16
of color associated with receiving mental health serv-
17
ices and informing individuals about available treat-
18
ment can encourage better utilization of these serv-
19
ices. 
20
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
21
It is the sense of the Congress that it is imperative 
22
that a comprehensive public health approach to addressing

that is culturally sensitive and competent.
