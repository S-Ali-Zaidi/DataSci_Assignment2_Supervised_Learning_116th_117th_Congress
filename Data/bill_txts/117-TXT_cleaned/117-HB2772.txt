SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. 
1
(a) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds that: 
2
(1) The prevalence of obesity in the United 
3
States has increased dramatically over the past 40 
4
years. From the 1960s to the late 1970s, the preva-
5
lence was relatively constant, with about 15 percent 
6
of the population classified as obese. After the 
7
1970s, these rates began to climb. According to the 
8
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, well 
9
over one-third of adults—42.4 percent (2017–18)— 
10
and 18.5 percent (2015–2016) of youth in the 
11
United States were obese. Although no group has es-
12
caped the epidemic, low-income people and commu-
13
nities of color are disproportionately affected. Nearly 
14
half (49.6 percent) of African-American adults were 
15
obese and 44.8 percent of Hispanic adults were 
16
obese in 2017–2018. 
17
(2) The percentage of children who are over-
18
weight has also increased dramatically in recent dec-
19
ades. After being relatively constant from the 1960s 
20
to the 1970s, the prevalence of overweight children 
21
has more than tripled among children between 6 and 
22
11 years of age and nearly quadrupled among those 
23
between 12 and 19 years of age. Despite significant 
24
public and private investment, childhood obesity 
25

H2772

•HR 2772 IH
rates among young people aged 2–19 remain high 
1
affecting about 13.7 million children. 
2
(3) There are significant racial and age dispari-
3
ties in obesity prevalence among children and adoles-
4
cents. In 2015–2016, obesity prevalence was higher 
5
among Hispanics (25.8 percent) and non-Hispanic 
6
Black youth (22.0 percent) than non-Hispanic White 
7
youth (14.1 percent). The prevalence of obesity was 
8
lower in non-Hispanic Asian youth (11.0 percent) 
9
than in youth who were non-Hispanic White, non- 
10
Hispanic Black, or Hispanic. 
11
(4) Overweight and obesity are responsible for 
12
an estimated $190 billion in health care costs na-
13
tionally, or approximately five to ten percent of all 
14
medical spending—with more than 20 percent of 
15
these costs paid publicly through the Medicare and 
16
Medicaid programs. The medical costs for people 
17
with obesity are dramatically higher than those with-
18
out obesity. 
19
(5) The obesity epidemic is of particular con-
20
cern because obesity increases the risk of diabetes, 
21
heart disease, certain types of cancer, arthritis, asth-
22
ma, and breathing problems. Depending on their 
23
level of obesity, from 60 percent to more than 80 
24
percent of obese adults have type 2 diabetes, high 
25

•HR 2772 IH
blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, or other re-
1
lated conditions. According to the CDC, nearly 60 
2
percent of overweight children have at least one risk 
3
factor for heart disease. 
4
(6) Overweight and obesity increase the risk for 
5
several types of common cancers, including post-
6
menopausal breast, colorectal, endometrial, kidney, 
7
pancreatic, esophageal, and gall bladder cancer. Up 
8
to one in four of all cancer cases and one in three 
9
cancer deaths are due to poor nutrition, physical in-
10
activity, and overweight and obesity. 
11
(7) There is overwhelming evidence of the link 
12
between the consumption of sugary drinks, such as 
13
non-diet soft drinks, energy drinks, sweet teas, and 
14
sports drinks, and obesity and diabetes. Sugary 
15
drinks are the only food or beverage shown to in-
16
crease the risk of overweight and obesity. Adults 
17
who drink one sugary drink or more per day are 27 
18
percent more likely to be overweight or obese, re-
19
gardless of income or ethnicity. After six months, 
20
daily consumption of one liter of sugary drinks in-
21
creases fat deposits in the liver by 150 percent, 
22
which directly contributes to both diabetes and heart 
23
disease. Over 10 years, about two million type 2 dia-
24
19:13 Jun 10, 2021
H2772
5 
•HR 2772 IH
betes cases in the United States are attributable to 
1
consumption of sugary drinks. 
2
(8) According to nutrition experts, sugary 
3
drinks, such as soft drinks, energy drinks, sweet 
4
teas, and sport drinks, offer little or no nutritional 
5
value, but massive quantities of added sugars. A 20- 
6
ounce bottle of soda contains about 16 teaspoons of 
7
sugars. Yet, the American Heart Association rec-
8
ommends that Americans consume no more than six 
9
to nine teaspoons of sugar per day from all food and 
10
beverage sources. 
11
(9) The 2020 Dietary Guidelines states that 
12
sugary drinks are the top source of added sugars in 
13
the American diet. For adults, sugary drinks (e.g., 
14
soda, sports drinks, energy drinks, fruit drinks) and 
15
sweetened coffees and teas (including ready-to-drink 
16
varieties) contribute over 40 percent of daily intake 
17
of added sugars. In childhood, sugary drinks make 
18
up about 15 to 25 percent of total added sugars in-
19
take. By adolescence, their contribution is 32 per-
20
cent and even higher when considering coffee and 
21
tea beverages with added sugars (an additional 7 
22
percent). The Dietary Guidelines Advisory Com-
23
mittee recommended that no more than 6 percent of 
24
daily calories come from added sugars. 
25
19:13 Jun 10, 2021
H2772
6 
•HR 2772 IH
(10) Though sugary drink consumption is de-
1
clining modestly as people learn about their harmful 
2
health effects, Americans are still consuming twice 
3
as much of these products as they did in the 1970s. 
4
Reports show that in recent years sugary drink pur-
5
chasing has only gone down 6 calories per person 
6
per day since 2014. Five percent of Americans con-
7
sume at least 567 kcal from sugar drinks on any 
8
given day—equal to more than four 12-ounce cans 
9
of soft drink. On average, children consume more 
10
than 30 gallons of sugary drinks every year. This is 
11
enough to fill a bathtub. 
12
(11) In a study of more than 50,000 female 
13
nurses, women who increased their sugary drink 
14
consumption from no more than one per week to at 
15
least one per day gained an average of 10 pounds 
16
over four years. Research also shows a significant 
17
link between sugary drink consumption and weight 
18
gain in children. In a randomized double-blind con-
19
trolled trial of roughly 640 children, those who were 
20
given one 8-ounce serving of a sugary drink a day 
21
gained more weight and body fat over 11⁄2 years 
22
than those who got one 8-ounce serving of a sugar- 
23
free drink.

•HR 2772 IH
(12) Sugary drinks are a unique contributor to 
1
excess caloric consumption. A large body of research 
2
shows that calories from sugary drinks do not sat-
3
isfy hunger the way calories from solid food or fat 
4
or protein-containing beverages such as those con-
5
taining milk and plant-based proteins. As a result, 
6
sugary drinks tend to add to the calories people con-
7
sume rather than replace calories from other foods 
8
and beverages. 
9
(13) Overweight children have a much greater 
10
chance of being obese as adults, with all the health 
11
risks that entails. 
12
(14) Type 2 diabetes, previously only seen 
13
among adults, is now increasing among children. 
14
Data show that almost a quarter of teens now have 
15
either diabetes or prediabetes. If the current trends 
16
are not reversed, it is predicted that one in three 
17
children and nearly one-half of Latino and African- 
18
American children born in the year 2000 will develop 
19
type 2 diabetes in their lifetime. 
20
(15) A 2015 review found that increasing sug-
21
ary drink consumption by one serving per day in-
22
creased the risk of heart disease by 17 percent and 
23
hypertension by 8 percent. In 2012, 50,000 deaths 
24
were associated with drinking too many sugary 
25
19:13 Jun 10, 2021
H2772
8 
•HR 2772 IH
drinks. Of that, 40,000 deaths in the U.S. were at-
1
tributed to heart problems and 10,000 deaths were 
2
attributed to type 2 diabetes caused specifically by 
3
consuming too many sugary drinks. 
4
(16) Tooth decay (dental caries) is the single 
5
most common chronic childhood disease, experienced 
6
by more than one-fourth of United States children 
7
aged 2–5 years and half of those aged 12–15 years. 
8
About half of all children and two-thirds of adoles-
9
cents aged 12–19 years from lower-income families 
10
have had decay. According to the American Academy 
11
of Pediatric Dentistry, children who frequently or 
12
excessively consume beverages high in sugar are at 
13
increased risk for dental caries. Untreated dental 
14
caries can lead to pain, infection, tooth loss, and in 
15
severe cases, even death. It can slow normal growth 
16
and development by restricting nutritional intake. 
17
Children who are missing teeth may have chewing 
18
problems that limit their food choices and result in 
19
nutritionally inadequate diets. 
20
(17) Local sugary drink taxes that have been 
21
implemented and evaluated in the United States 
22
have consistently decreased sales of taxed beverages 
23
by a range of 10 to 39 percent. They have also 
24
raised millions of dollars for community priorities.

(b) PURPOSES.—It is the intent of the Congress, by 
1
adopting the Sugary Drinks Tax Act (also known as the 
2
SWEET Act), to diminish the human and economic costs 
3
of diabetes, obesity, dental caries, and other diet-related 
4
health conditions. This Act is intended to discourage ex-
5
cessive consumption of sugary drinks by increasing the 
6
price of these products and by creating a dedicated rev-
7
enue source for programs and research designed to reduce 
8
the human and economic costs of diabetes, obesity, dental 
9
caries, and other diet-related health conditions in dis-
10
proportionately impacted populations.
