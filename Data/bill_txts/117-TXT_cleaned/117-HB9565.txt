A BILL 
To address the health of cancer survivors and unmet needs 
that survivors face through the entire continuum of care 
from 
diagnosis 
through 
active 
treatment 
and 
posttreatment, in order to improve survivorship, treat-
ment, transition to recovery and beyond, quality of life 
and palliative care, and long-term health outcomes, in-
cluding by developing a minimum standard of care for 
cancer survivorship, irrespective of the type of cancer,

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following: 
9
(1) A cancer survivor is any individual with a 
10
history of cancer, from the time of diagnosis through 
11
the rest of their life, across the continuum of care. 
12
(2) Today, there are approximately 18,000,000 
13
Americans who are cancer survivors, and the num-
14
ber of survivors is projected to reach 26,000,000 by 
15
2040. Therefore, there is a great need to be able to

provide ways to sustain the care needed and to offer 
1
those living with, through, and beyond cancer a safe, 
2
supportive, and accommodating environment where 
3
such individuals can engage in physical and social 
4
support activities to sustain optimal quality of life. 
5
(3) Cancer survivors face difficult emotional, 
6
psychological, neurological, financial, and other 
7
physical challenges that persist beyond diagnosis and 
8
treatment, often arising months and years after ac-
9
tive cancer treatment ends. 
10
(4) Cancer survivors have unique needs and 
11
must manage short- and long-term effects of their 
12
treatment, as well as regular screenings for cancer 
13
recurrence or new cancers. 
14
(5) Cancer survivors of racial and ethnic diver-
15
sity have disproportionately lower health-related, 
16
quality-of-life scores compared to non-Hispanic 
17
White cancer survivors. 
18
(6) Cancer survivors living in rural areas have 
19
less access to services and have poorer outcomes 
20
than survivors in metropolitan areas. 
21
(7) Children, adolescent, and young adult can-
22
cer survivors are particularly susceptible to long- 
23
term consequences from treatment, and up to 80 
24
percent have a severe, disabling, life-threatening, or

•HR 9565 IH
fatal health condition by the age of 50. Best prac-
1
tices in this area would improve treatment, quality 
2
of life, and long-term health outcomes. 
3
(8) Clinical trials have shown that cancer survi-
4
vorship programs help cancer survivors meet or ex-
5
ceed the recommended amount of physical activity, 
6
significantly increasing their cardiovascular health 
7
and overall quality of life and decreasing their can-
8
cer-related fatigue. 
9
(9) Survivorship care refers to the medical or 
10
psychosocial care of an individual who has completed 
11
their primary treatment for cancer, or of an indi-
12
vidual who is undergoing maintenance or intermit-
13
tent medical treatment or maintenance psychosocial 
14
care for cancer, or of an individual living with meta-
15
static disease under continuous medical or psycho-
16
social treatment. 
17
(10) Despite the National Cancer Institute and 
18
other professional organizations’ definition of a can-
19
cer survivor beginning on the day of a cancer diag-
20
nosis, there is little agreement among clinicians, re-
21
searchers, and insurance companies on what services 
22
are included in ‘‘survivorship care’’ and the point at 
23
which ‘‘survivorship care’’ begins.

(11) Cancer survivors, their families, their care-
1
givers, and their providers face many difficulties un-
2
derstanding and coordinating the transition from 
3
specialty to primary care, and for this reason com-
4
munication and treatment are often fragmented and 
5
inconsistent. 
6
(12) To avoid additional health-related or finan-
7
cial hardships to cancer survivors and their families, 
8
comprehensive and forward-thinking cancer survivor-
9
ship studies and programs across Federal agencies 
10
are required to engage in a coordinated effort to im-
11
prove health outcomes and quality of life of sur-
