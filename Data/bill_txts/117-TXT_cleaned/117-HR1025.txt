RESOLUTION 
Recognizing April 4, 2022, as the International Day for 
Mine Awareness and Assistance in Mine Action, and 
reaffirming the leadership of the United States in elimi-
nating landmines and unexploded ordnance. 
Whereas landmines and unexploded ordnance threaten the 
safety, health, and lives of civilian populations and create 
humanitarian and development challenges that have seri-
ous and lasting social, economic, and security con-
sequences for affected populations; 
Whereas demining and clearance of unexploded ordnance en-
ables displaced people to return to their homes and has 
a direct impact on development outcomes such as food se-
curity, school attendance, and economic development;

Whereas people in at least 60 countries and other areas are 
at risk from mines and unexploded ordnance in their 
communities; 
Whereas more than 125,000 deaths and injuries resulting 
from anti-personnel or anti-vehicle mines and other explo-
sive remnants of war have been recorded in the Land-
mine Monitor database since 2001, and thousands more 
individuals around the world are killed and injured by 
such mines and remnants each year; 
Whereas, over the past 3 decades, the United States has been 
the global leader in supporting efforts to clear mine-con-
taminated areas around the world, dedicating more than 
$4,000,000,000 for demining and related programs since 
1993 and helping to eliminate more than 90,000 tons of 
ordnance in nearly 40 countries; 
Whereas, since 1989, the United States Agency for Inter-
national 
Development 
has 
allocated 
more 
than 
$324,000,000 through the Leahy War Victims Fund in 
more than 50 countries to provide artificial limbs, wheel-
chairs, rehabilitation, vocational training, and other as-
sistance to survivors of accidents caused by landmines 
and unexploded ordnance; 
Whereas landmines contaminate countries in which the 
United States Armed Forces have been engaged in com-
bat or stabilization operations, including Iraq, Syria, 
Kosovo, and Somalia, posing a significant risk to United 
States military personnel; 
Whereas the United States Government expressed its support 
for the Maputo +15 declaration of June 27, 2014, which 
established the goal ‘‘to destroy all stockpiled anti-per-

sonnel mines and clear all mined areas as soon as pos-
sible,’’ and ‘‘to the fullest extent possible by 2025’’; 
Whereas there are 164 States Parties to the Convention on 
the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and 
Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruc-
tion, done at Oslo September 18, 1997, although the 
United States is not yet among them; 
Whereas the recent use of landmines, cluster bombs, and 
other munitions, particularly in the Middle East, Afghan-
istan, and Ukraine, has created new humanitarian prior-
ities and funding requirements for demining, while legacy 
mine contamination remains an urgent challenge impact-
ing millions of people globally; 
Whereas additional resources for demining will be needed to 
achieve a world free of the threat of landmines and other 
explosive hazards; and 
Whereas, on December 8, 2005, the United Nations General 
Assembly declared that April 4th of each year shall be 
observed as the International Day for Mine Awareness 
and Assistance in Mine Action: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) reaffirms the commitment of the United 
2
States to support international humanitarian efforts 
3
to eliminate landmines and unexploded ordnance; 
4
(2) recognizes those individuals in numerous 
5
countries who, at great risk to their personal safety, 
6
work to locate and remove anti-personnel landmines 
7
and unexploded ordnance;
