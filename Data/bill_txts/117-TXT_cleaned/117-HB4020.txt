A BILL 
To reform United States drug policy, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following: 
7
19:11 Jul 20, 2021
H4020

•HR 4020 IH
(1) For most of the past century the United 
1
States has adopted increasingly punitive policies to-
2
ward the possession, use, and distribution of drugs. 
3
Particularly in the last 50 years, the United States 
4
has built a massive regime to enforce those policies. 
5
(2) Congress and State legislatures have adopt-
6
ed increasingly harsh sentencing schemes such as 
7
mandatory minimums, established far-reaching and 
8
oppressive 
civil 
sanctions 
and 
collateral 
con-
9
sequences, approved policies weakening the Fourth 
10
Amendment for drug searches and seizures, and fos-
11
tered incentives for aggressive and militarized polic-
12
ing in the alleged pursuit of drugs. 
13
(3) Every year, there are more than 1.4 million 
14
arrests in the United States for drug-related of-
15
fenses. In over 85 percent of those arrests, drug pos-
16
session was the most serious offense. Drug arrests 
17
disproportionately impact people of color and more 
18
commonly occur in historically overpoliced, low-in-
19
come communities. A criminal record, even for an 
20
arrest that did not result in a conviction, has a pro-
21
found impact on individuals, often interrupting em-
22
ployment, housing, family relationships, child cus-
23
tody, and education. 
24
19:11 Jul 20, 2021
H4020

•HR 4020 IH
(4) A health-based approach to drug use and 
1
overdose is more effective, humane and cost-effective 
2
than criminal punishments. Subjecting people to 
3
criminal penalties, stigma, and other lasting collat-
4
eral consequences because they use drugs is expen-
5
sive, ruins lives, and can make access to treatment 
6
and recovery more difficult. 
7
(5) Despite high numbers of arrests and incar-
8
ceration in the United States for drug possession, 
9
the number and rate of drug-involved overdose 
10
deaths has skyrocketed for over 20 years and con-
11
tinues at epidemic levels. In 2019, 70,630 people 
12
died by drug overdose in the United States. 
13
(6) Harm reduction services and voluntary, on- 
14
demand access to evidence-based substance use dis-
15
order treatment have proven highly effective in re-
16
ducing overdose and the spread of communicable 
17
diseases like HIV and Hepatitis C, preventing drug- 
18
related injury, and improving health outcomes for 
19
people who use drugs. These services should be 
20
available on demand to anyone who requests it. 
21
(7) Far too many people who desire treatment 
22
face challenges that prevent them from accessing the 
23
services they want, including cost barriers, lack of 
24
providers, and long wait-lists. On-demand access to 
25
19:11 Jul 20, 2021
H4020
4 
•HR 4020 IH
evidence-based treatment saves lives, reduces crime, 
1
and saves money. Barriers to treatment should be 
2
removed or minimized. 
3
(8) Criminalizing drug use and possession re-
4
duces the amount of resources available for harm re-
5
duction and treatment services and deters people 
6
from accessing available services due to fear of ar-
7
rest. 
8
(9) Punitive policies have achieved no reduction 
9
in supplies or prices, but instead have created un-
10
necessarily risky and harmful conditions for people 
11
who use drugs. 
12
(10) Punitive policies have led to militarized 
13
tactics that thwart the spirit of the constitution and 
14
have led to the deaths of countless Black and Brown 
15
people. Additionally, the drug war apparatus has 
16
cost the Federal Government hundreds of billions of 
17
dollars in direct enforcement and incarceration costs, 
18
and collateral impacts on the lives of those caught 
19
in its path. 
20
(11) While drug decriminalization cannot fully 
21
repair our broken and oppressive criminal legal sys-
22
tem or the harms of an unregulated drug market, 
23
shifting from absolute prohibition to drug decrimi-
24
nalization helps restore individual liberty, protect 
25

against some police abuses, better assist those in 
1
need, and save tax dollars. 
2
(12) This concept is neither new nor radical. 
3
Other nations, including Portugal, have successfully 
4
decriminalized personal use quantities of drugs and 
5
achieved meaningful improvements in treating prob-
6
lematic drug use and reducing the harms of policing 
7
drugs. 
8
(13) In June 2021, the United States will mark 
9
the 50th anniversary of Congress’ enactment of the 
10
Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.), 
11
which authorized and launched the harsh drug war 
12
policies sought by the Nixon Administration. In this 
13
moment, Congress must recognize the failed experi-
14
ment in prohibition and move the country in a new 
15
direction. 
16
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
17
It is the sense of Congress that the United States 
18
should— 
19
(1) refocus its strategies for addressing sub-
20
stance use disorder and dangerous drug use from 
21
strategies focused on controlling and punishing un-
22
authorized drug possession to a system that is 
23
health focused, evidence-based, and respectful of 
24
self-determination; 
25

•HR 4020 IH
(2) invest in harm-reduction services and sub-
1
stance use disorder treatment to help prevent over-
2
dose and other health risks, and strengthen connec-
3
tions to services that provide foundational social and 
4
economic support; and 
5
(3) pursue international treaties that expand 
6
flexibility for signatories to enact non-punitive strat-
7
egies to address the health and safety of people who 
8
use drugs, including the decriminalization of the 
9
possession, purchase, or cultivation of personal use 
10
quantities of drugs.

SEC. 10. PROTECT VOTING RIGHTS. 
17
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following find-
18
ings: 
19
(1) The right to vote is the most basic constitu-
20
tive act of citizenship. Regaining the right to vote 
21
reintegrates individuals with criminal convictions 
22
into free society, helping to enhance public safety. 
23
(2) Article I, section 4, of the Constitution 
24
grants Congress ultimate supervisory power over 
25
19:11 Jul 20, 2021
H4020
20 
•HR 4020 IH
Federal elections, an authority which has repeatedly 
1
been upheld by the Supreme Court. 
2
(3) Basic constitutional principles of fairness 
3
and equal protection require an equal opportunity 
4
for citizens of the United States to vote in Federal 
5
elections. The right to vote may not be abridged or 
6
denied by the United States or by any State on ac-
7
count of race, color, gender, or previous condition of 
8
servitude. The 13th, 14th, 15th, 19th, 24th, and 
9
26th Amendments to the Constitution empower Con-
10
gress to enact measures to protect the right to vote 
11
in Federal elections. The 8th Amendment to the 
12
Constitution provides for no excessive bail to be re-
13
quired, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and 
14
unusual punishments inflicted. 
15
(4) There are 3 areas in which discrepancies in 
16
State laws regarding criminal convictions lead to un-
17
fairness in Federal elections: 
18
(A) The lack of a uniform standard for 
19
voting in Federal elections leads to an unfair 
20
disparity and unequal participation in Federal 
21
elections based solely on where a person lives. 
22
(B) Laws governing the restoration of vot-
23
ing rights after a criminal conviction vary 
24
throughout the country, and persons in some 
25
19:11 Jul 20, 2021
H4020
21 
•HR 4020 IH
States can easily regain their voting rights 
1
while in other States persons effectively lose 
2
their right to vote permanently. 
3
(C) State disenfranchisement laws dis-
4
proportionately impact racial and ethnic minori-
5
ties. 
6
(5) Two States (Maine and Vermont), the Dis-
7
trict of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto 
8
Rico do not disenfranchise individuals with criminal 
9
convictions at all, but 48 States have laws that deny 
10
convicted individuals the right to vote while they are 
11
in prison. 
12
(6) In some States disenfranchisement results 
13
from varying State laws that restrict voting while in-
14
dividuals are under the supervision of the criminal 
15
justice system or after they have completed a crimi-
16
nal sentence. In 30 States, convicted individuals may 
17
not vote while they are on parole and 27 States dis-
18
enfranchise individuals on felony probation as well. 
19
In 11 States, a conviction can result in lifetime dis-
20
enfranchisement. 
21
(7) Several States deny the right to vote to in-
22
dividuals convicted of certain misdemeanors. 
23
(8) An estimated 5,200,000 citizens of the 
24
United States, or about 1 in 44 adults in the United 
25
19:11 Jul 20, 2021
H4020
22 
•HR 4020 IH
States, currently cannot vote as a result of a felony 
1
conviction. Of the 5,200,000 citizens barred from 
2
voting, only 24 percent are in prison. By contrast, 
3
75 percent of the disenfranchised reside in their 
4
communities while on probation or parole or after 
5
having completed their sentences. Approximately 
6
2,200,000 citizens who have completed their sen-
7
tences remain disenfranchised due to restrictive 
8
State laws. In at least 6 States—Alabama, Florida, 
9
Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Virginia— 
10
more than 5 percent of the total voting-age popu-
11
lation is disenfranchised. 
12
(9) In those States that disenfranchise individ-
13
uals post-sentence, the right to vote can be regained 
14
in theory, but in practice this possibility is often 
15
granted in a non-uniform and potentially discrimina-
16
tory manner. Disenfranchised individuals must ei-
17
ther obtain a pardon or an order from the Governor 
18
or an action by the parole or pardon board, depend-
19
ing on the offense and State. Individuals convicted 
20
of a Federal offense often have additional barriers to 
21
regaining voting rights. 
22
(10) State disenfranchisement laws dispropor-
23
tionately impact racial and ethnic minorities. More 
24
than 6 percent of the African-American voting-age 
25
19:11 Jul 20, 2021
H4020
23 
•HR 4020 IH
population, or 1,800,000 African Americans, are 
1
disenfranchised. Currently, 1 of every 16 voting-age 
2
African Americans are rendered unable to vote be-
3
cause of felony disenfranchisement, which is a rate 
4
more than 3.7 times greater than non-African Amer-
5
icans. Over 6 percent of African-American adults are 
6
disenfranchised whereas only 1.7 percent of non-Af-
7
rican Americans are. In 7 States (Alabama, 16 per-
8
cent; Florida, 15 percent; Kentucky, 15 percent; 
9
Mississippi, 16 percent; Tennessee, 21 percent; Vir-
10
ginia, 16 percent; and Wyoming, 36 percent), more 
11
than 1 in 7 African Americans are unable to vote 
12
because of prior convictions, twice the national aver-
13
age for African Americans. 
14
(11) Latino citizens are disproportionately 
15
disenfranchised based upon their disproportionate 
16
representation in the criminal justice system. In re-
17
cent years, Latinos have been imprisoned at 2.5 
18
times the rate of Whites. More than 2 percent of the 
19
voting-age Latino population, or 560,000 Latinos, 
20
are disenfranchised due to a felony conviction. In 34 
21
states Latinos are disenfranchised at a higher rate 
22
than the general population. In 11 states 4 percent 
23
or more of Latino adults are disenfranchised due to 
24
a felony conviction (Alabama, 4 percent; Arizona, 7

percent; Arkansas, 4 percent; Idaho, 4 percent; 
1
Iowa, 4 percent; Kentucky, 6 percent; Minnesota, 4 
2
percent; Mississippi, 5 percent; Nebraska, 6 percent; 
3
Tennessee, 11 percent, Wyoming, 4 percent), twice 
4
the national average for Latinos. 
5
(12) Disenfranchising citizens who have been 
6
convicted of a criminal offense and who are living 
7
and working in the community serves no compelling 
8
State interest and hinders their rehabilitation and 
9
reintegration into society. 
10
(13) State disenfranchisement laws can sup-
11
press electoral participation among eligible voters by 
12
discouraging voting among family and community 
13
members of disenfranchised persons. Future elec-
14
toral participation by the children of disenfranchised 
15
parents may be impacted as well. 
16
(14) The United States is the only Western de-
17
mocracy that permits the permanent denial of voting 
18
rights for individuals with felony convictions.
