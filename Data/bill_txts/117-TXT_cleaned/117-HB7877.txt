‘‘SEC. 1402. FINDINGS. 
1
‘‘Congress finds the following: 
2
‘‘(1) Drowning is a public health crisis. Drown-
3
ing can happen in seconds, is often silent, and can 
4
happen to anyone, anytime there is access to water. 
5
‘‘(2) About 11 people die each day from drown-
6
ing in the United States, and drowning kills nearly 
7
4,000 people each year in the United States. 
8
‘‘(3) Of injury-related deaths, drowning is the 
9
first leading cause of accidental death in children 
10
aged 1 to 4 in the United States, and the second 
11
leading cause of accidental death in children aged 1 
12
to 14 in the United States. 
13
‘‘(4) Drowning death rates for Black people are 
14
1.5 times higher than the rates for White people, 
15
and drowning death rates for American Indian peo-
16
ple ages 29 and younger are 2 times higher than the 
17
rates for White people in the same age range. 
18
‘‘(5) People in rural areas of the United States 
19
are 26 percent more likely to die by drowning than 
20
people in urban areas of the United States. 
21
‘‘(6) Research shows that the installation and 
22
proper use of barriers or fencing, as well as addi-
23
tional layers of protection, such as swimming les-
24
sons, could substantially reduce the number of child-
