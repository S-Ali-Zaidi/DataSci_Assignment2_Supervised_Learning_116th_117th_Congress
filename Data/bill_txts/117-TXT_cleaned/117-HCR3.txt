CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 
Censuring President Donald J. Trump for attempting to 
overturn the results of the 2020 Presidential election 
through unlawful means and for inciting insurrection. 
Whereas, on January 2, 2021, President Donald J. Trump 
called 
the 
secretary 
of 
state 
of 
Georgia, 
Brad 
Raffensperger, demanding that Secretary Raffensperger, 
inter alia, overturn the results of the 2020 presidential 
election in Georgia by ‘‘find[ing] me 11,780 votes,’’ which 
would change the outcome in that State’s election and 
nullify the votes of millions of Americans who voted for 
President-elect Joseph R. Biden, including African Amer-
icans and other people of color, notwithstanding that the 
State had already certified the winner after thrice count-
ing the votes in favor of President-elect Biden;

Whereas President Trump has consistently raised unsubstan-
tiated claims of voter fraud, while producing no evidence 
in court or to the public, challenging the security and ac-
curacy of the 2020 Presidential election, despite his Ad-
ministration saying that this was the most secure election 
in U.S. history; 
Whereas President Trump has incited his followers to chal-
lenge the election with his baseless claims against the 
2020 Presidential election; 
Whereas, on January 6, 2021, the House of Representatives 
and Senate met at the United States Capitol in a Joint 
Session to count the votes of the Electoral College; 
Whereas, on January 6, 2021, immediately prior to the Joint 
Session, President Trump spoke to a large crowd in the 
District of Columbia, where he again raised baseless 
questions about the legitimacy of the 2020 Presidential 
election and thereby encouraged the crowd to falsely be-
lieve that fraud had occurred; 
Whereas, in his speech on January 6, 2021, President Trump 
used phrases like ‘‘fight like hell’’, ‘‘[y]ou have to show 
strength and you have to be strong’’, ‘‘you’ll never take 
back our country with weakness’’, and ‘‘everyone here 
will soon be marching over to the Capitol’’; said that 
President-elect Biden and his supporters are ‘‘not gonna 
take this White House’’, and again stated that he won 
the election ‘‘by a lot’’ and that ‘‘we won this election, 
and we won it by a landslide’’; 
Whereas, on January 6, 2021, members of the crowd, incited 
by the President’s speech, and intending to, among other 
objectives, interfere with the counting of the votes of the

Electoral College, breached the United States Capitol, 
and committed violent, seditious, and destructive acts; 
Whereas, as a result of that attack on the Capitol, at least 
five individuals lost their lives, and numerous others were 
left injured; 
Whereas, during the attack, President Trump told the insur-
rectionists, ‘‘we love you’’, and told them to remember 
that day forever; and 
Whereas President Trump has violated his constitutional du-
ties to ‘‘preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of 
the United States’’ and to ‘‘faithfully execute’’ his office: 
Now, therefore, be it: 
Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate 
1
concurring), That the House of Representatives (the Sen-
2
ate concurring)— 
3
(1) censures President Donald J. Trump for 
4
the actions he took as set forth above, including at-
5
tempting to overturn the 2020 Presidential election

itol on January 6, 2021;

actions, President Donald J. Trump ‘‘as an officer

of the United States . . . engaged in insurrection or

such disability,’’ under section 3 of the 14th Amend-

ment to the United States Constitution.
