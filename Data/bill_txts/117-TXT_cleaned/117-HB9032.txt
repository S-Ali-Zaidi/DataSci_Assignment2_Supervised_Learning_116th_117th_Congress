SEC. 2. EXTENSION OF DISCRETIONARY SPENDING LIMITS. 
1
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
2
gress that— 
3
(1) 
the 
current 
fiscal 
trajectory 
is 
4
unsustainable, with the Federal debt now exceeding 
5
$30 trillion; 
6
(2) the Congressional Budget Office projects 
7
that spending, as a share of Gross Domestic Prod-
8
uct, will rise from 19.6 percent in fiscal year 2022, 
9
to 24.3 percent by the end of the decade, and the 
10
Federal debt is projected to increase by approxi-
11
mately $16 trillion over the next 10 years; 
12
(3) the absence of fiscal guardrails, such as 
13
statutory discretionary spending caps, means that 
14
there is no meaningful restraint on Congress’ ability 
15
to appropriate excessive spending; 
16
(4) spending caps are a necessary tool to help 
17
bring spending under control and were in place from 
18
1991 through 2002 and again from 2012 through 
19
2021; 
20
(5) this legislation is a framework, based on 
21
May 2022 Congressional Budget Office projections, 
22
that would help rein in discretionary spending; and 
23
(6) the discretionary caps set forth below are 
24
designed to slow discretionary spending growth rates

and may need to be amended to incorporate subse-
