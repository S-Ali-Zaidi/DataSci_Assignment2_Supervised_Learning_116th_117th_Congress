A BILL 
To reduce spending on nuclear weapons and related defense 
spending and to prohibit the procurement and deploy-
ment of low-yield nuclear warheads, and for other pur-
poses. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

Congress makes the following findings:

•HR 3653 IH
(1) The United States continues to maintain an 
1
excessively large and costly arsenal of nuclear deliv-
2
ery systems and warheads that are a holdover from 
3
the Cold War. 
4
(2) The current nuclear arsenal of the United 
5
States includes approximately 3,800 total nuclear 
6
warheads in its military stockpile, of which approxi-
7
mately 1,800 are deployed with five delivery compo-
8
nents: land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, 
9
submarine-launched ballistic missiles, long-range 
10
strategic bomber aircraft armed with nuclear gravity 
11
bombs, long-range strategic bomber aircraft armed 
12
with nuclear-armed air-launched cruise missiles, and 
13
short-range fighter aircraft that can deliver nuclear 
14
gravity bombs. The strategic bomber fleet of the 
15
United States comprises 87 B–52 and 20 B–2 air-
16
craft, over 60 of which contribute to the nuclear 
17
mission. The United States also maintains 400 
18
intercontinental ballistic missiles and 14 Ohio-class 
19
submarines, up to 12 of which are deployed. Each 
20
of those submarines is armed with approximately 90 
21
nuclear warheads. 
22
(3) Between fiscal years 2019 and 2028, the 
23
United States will spend $494,000,000,000 to main-
24
tain and recapitalize its nuclear force, according to 
25

•HR 3653 IH
a January 2019 estimate from the Congressional 
1
Budget Office, an increase of $94,000,000,000 from 
2
the Congressional Budget Office’s 2017 estimate, 
3
with additional cost driven in part by the new nu-
4
clear weapons called for in former President Donald 
5
Trump’s 2018 Nuclear Posture Review. 
6
(4) Adjusted for inflation, the Congressional 
7
Budget Office estimates that the United States will 
8
spend $1,700,000,000,000 through fiscal year 2046 
9
on new nuclear weapons and modernization and in-
10
frastructure programs. 
11
(5) Inaccurate budget forecasting is likely to 
12
continue to plague the Department of Defense and 
13
the Department of Energy, as evidenced by the fis-
14
cal year 2021 budget request of the President for 
15
the 
National 
Nuclear 
Security 
Administration 
16
‘‘Weapon Activities’’ account, which far exceeded 
17
what the National Nuclear Security Administration 
18
had projected in its fiscal year 2020 request and 
19
what it had projected in previous years. 
20
(6) The projected growth in nuclear weapons 
21
spending is coming due as the Department of De-
22
fense is seeking to replace large portions of its con-
23
ventional forces to better compete with the Russian 
24
Federation and the People’s Republic of China and 
25
02:30 Jun 26, 2021

•HR 3653 IH
as internal and external fiscal pressures are likely to 
1
limit the growth of, and perhaps reduce, military 
2
spending. As then-Air Force Chief of Staff General 
3
Dave Goldfein said in 2020, ‘‘I think a debate is 
4
that this will be the first time that the nation has 
5
tried to simultaneously modernize the nuclear enter-
6
prise while it’s trying to modernize an aging conven-
7
tional enterprise. The current budget does not allow 
8
you to do both.’’. 
9
(7) In 2017, the Government Accountability Of-
10
fice concluded that National Nuclear Security Ad-
11
ministration’s budget forecasts for out-year spending 
12
downplayed the fact that the agency lacked the re-
13
sources to complete multiple, simultaneous billion 
14
dollar modernization projects and recommended that 
15
the National Nuclear Security Administration con-
16
sider ‘‘deferring the start of or cancelling specific 
17
modernization programs’’. 
18
(8) According to the Government Accountability 
19
Office, the National Nuclear Security Administration 
20
has still not factored affordability concerns into its 
21
planning as was recommended by the Government 
22
Accountability Office in 2017, with the warning that 
23
‘‘it is essential for NNSA to present information to 
24
Congress and other key decision maker indicating 
25
02:30 Jun 26, 2021

•HR 3653 IH
whether the agency has prioritized certain mod-
1
ernization programs or considered trade-offs (such 
2
as deferring or cancelling specific modernization pro-
3
grams)’’. 
4
(9) A December 2020 Congressional Budget 
5
Office analysis showed that the projected costs of 
6
nuclear forces over the next decade can be reduced 
7
by $12,400,000,000 to $13,600,000,000 by trim-
8
ming back current plans, while still maintaining a 
9
triad of delivery systems. Even larger savings would 
10
accrue over the subsequent decade. 
11
(10) The Department of Defense’s June 2013 
12
nuclear policy guidance entitled ‘‘Report on Nuclear 
13
Employment Strategy of the United States’’ found 
14
that force levels under the April 2010 Treaty on 
15
Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation 
16
of Strategic Offensive Arms between the United 
17
States and the Russian Federation (commonly 
18
known as the ‘‘New START Treaty’’) ‘‘are more 
19
than adequate for what the United States needs to 
20
fulfill its national security objectives’’ and can be re-
21
duced by up to 1⁄3 below levels under the New 
22
START Treaty to 1,000 to 1,100 warheads. 
23

24
role of, and spending on, nuclear weapons in United
