free from any burden on the time, place, or manner of 
1
voting, as set forth in subsections (b) and (c). 
2
(b) RETROGRESSION.—A government may not dimin-
3
ish the ability to vote in an election for Federal office un-
4
less the law, rule, standard, practice, procedure, or other 
5
governmental action causing the diminishment is the least 
6
restrictive means of significantly furthering an important, 
7
particularized government interest. 
8
(c) SUBSTANTIAL IMPAIRMENT.—A government may 
9
not substantially impair the ability to vote in an election 
10
for Federal office unless the law, rule, standard, practice, 
11
procedure, or other governmental action causing the im-
12
pairment significantly furthers an important, particular-
13
ized governmental interest. A substantial impairment is a 
14
non-trivial impairment that makes it more difficult to vote 
15
than if the law, standard, practice, procedure, or other 
16
governmental action had not been adopted or imple-
17
mented. An impairment may be substantial even if the 
18
voter or other similarly situated voters are able to vote 
19
notwithstanding the impairment.

22

23

the violation took place or where any defendant resides 
1
or does business, at the selection of the plaintiff, to obtain 
2
all appropriate relief, whether declaratory or injunctive, or 
3
facial or as-applied. Process may be served in any district 
4
where a defendant resides, does business, or may be found. 
5
(b) STANDARDS TO BE APPLIED.—In a civil action 
6
under this section, the following shall apply: 
7
(1) RETROGRESSION.— 
8
(A) A plaintiff establishes a prima facie 
9
case of retrogression by demonstrating by a 
10
preponderance of the evidence that a rule, 
11
standard, practice, procedure, or other govern-
12
mental action diminishes the ability, or other-
13
wise makes it more difficult, to vote. 
14
(B) Once a plaintiff establishes a prima 
15
facie case as described in subparagraph (A), the 
16
government shall be provided an opportunity to 
17
demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence 
18
that the diminishment is necessary to signifi-
19
cantly further an important, particularized gov-
20
ernmental interest. 
21
(C) If the government meets its burden 
22
under subparagraph (B), the challenged rule, 
23
standard, practice, procedure, or other govern-
24
mental action shall nonetheless be deemed in-

•HR 4959 IH
valid if the plaintiff demonstrates by a prepon-
1
derance of the evidence that the government 
2
could adopt or implement a less-restrictive 
3
means of furthering the particular important 
4
governmental interest. 
5
(2) SUBSTANTIAL IMPAIRMENT.— 
6
(A) A plaintiff establishes a prima facie 
7
case 
of 
substantial 
impairment 
by 
dem-
8
onstrating by a preponderance of the evidence 
9
that a rule, standard, practice, procedure, or 
10
other governmental action substantially impairs 
11
the ability, or makes it substantially difficult, to 
12
vote. 
13
(B) Once a plaintiff establishes a prima 
14
facie case as described in subparagraph (A), the 
15
government shall be provided an opportunity to 
16
demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence 
17
that the impairment significantly furthers an 
18
important, particularized governmental interest. 
19
(c) DUTY TO EXPEDITE.—It shall be the duty of the 
20
court to advance on the docket and to expedite to the 
21
greatest reasonable extent the disposition of the action 
22
and appeal under this section.

24
