Whereas immigrants working in health care professions serve

Whereas the medical students, residents, and physicians who

Whereas immigrants have filled approximately 1⁄3 of physi-
cian roles in the United States each year for the 10 years

•HRES 510 IH 
Whereas undocumented immigrants alone contribute an esti-
mated $228,000,000,000 of spending power annually to

Whereas immigrants have put their lives on the line to pro-
tect the ideals of the United States and democracy, as 
well as lives of the people of the United States, by serv-
ing as translators and interpreters for the Armed Forces, 
and performing sensitive and trusted activities for United 
States military personnel stationed with the International 
Security Assistance Force; 
Whereas immigrants who serve in emerging industries with 
pronounced labor shortages in the United States, such as

gineering, and mathematics (referred to in this preamble

enhance national security and global leadership; 
Whereas when immigrants have a trusting relationship with

worked with police on neighborhood crime reduction 
strategies; 
Whereas more immigrants reside in the United States than 
any other country in the world and represent almost 
every country in the world, contributing to the rich diver-
sity in the United States of people, cultures, cuisine, lit-
erature, art, language, academia, music, media, fashion, 
and customs; 
Whereas the United States is more diverse than ever before 
in its history, with greater shares of immigrants from 
countries such as India, China (including those born in 
Hong Kong and Macao, but not Taiwan), the Philippines,

ment and the criminal justice system and to demand that 
law enforcement protect people, regardless of their skin 
color; 
Whereas celebrating the racial, ethnic, linguistic, and reli-
gious differences of immigrants has resulted in a unified, 
patriotic, and prosperous United States;

Whereas immigrants of all skill levels have helped make the 
economy of the United States the strongest in the world, 
complementing existing businesses in the United States 
in times of need and founding successful businesses of 
their own; 
Whereas, although only accounting for 13.7 percent (nearly 
45,000,000 people) of the total population of the United 
States, more than 40 percent of Fortune 500 companies 
were founded by immigrants or their children, which has 
created $4,200,000,000,000 in annual revenue and em-
ploy millions of people of the United States; 
Whereas 64.5 percent of immigrants aged 16 and older were 
employed, as opposed to 60.0 percent of native-born peo-
ple of the United States; 
Whereas immigrants are entrepreneurial, self-starters who

ties for others, with 11.8 percent of employed immigrants 
being self-employed compared to 8.9 percent of employed, 
native-born people of the United States; 
Whereas immigrant-owned businesses provide jobs across the 
United States, creating more jobs through entrepre-
neurial activity than they fill; 
Whereas immigrants are more likely to have advanced de-
grees than native-born people of the United States; 
Whereas the high-skilled immigration system of the United 
States has not been updated in more than 25 years and 
is now outdated and overburdened, putting global leader-
ship of the United States at risk; 
Whereas national security experts agree that it is essential 
for 
the 
United 
States 
to 
maintain 
its 
military 
exceptionalism by being the leader in advanced tech-

nologies such as artificial intelligence, cyber, quantum, 
robotics, directed energy, and hypersonic weapons, which 
are all STEM fields where immigrants fill dangerous 
labor shortages in the United States; 
Whereas, due to population aging and longer life expectancy 
of the population in the United States requiring an in-
crease in health care workers, immigrants are expected to 
fill a crucial need in the future health care of the United 
States, keeping the people of the United States healthy; 
Whereas, in just 20 years, meaningful immigration policy re-
form could reduce the Federal deficit by approximately 
$1,000,000,000,000, contributing to greater economic 
stability and safety; 
Whereas, over the course of the next decade, immigration pol-
icy reform would result in the creation of 3,230,000 new 
jobs, keeping the United States more economically sound; 
Whereas if individuals with DACA status, alone, were pro-
vided a pathway to citizenship, they would contribute ap-
proximately $799,000,000,000 to the economy of the 
United States over 10 years; 
Whereas future population growth in the United States will 
require increased immigration, and by increasing immi-
gration substantially, will keep the United States eco-
nomically competitive with China and other global econo-
mies, and reduce future fiscal imbalances for popular 
programs like programs under the Social Security Act 
(42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.); and 
Whereas continued integration of immigrants from around 
the world that encourages and facilitates a pathway to 
citizenship, economic and social mobility, and civic en-
gagement, will perpetuate the prosperity of the United
