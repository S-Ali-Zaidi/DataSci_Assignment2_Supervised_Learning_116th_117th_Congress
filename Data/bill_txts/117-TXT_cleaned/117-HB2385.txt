SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) In June 1948, Congress enacted the Wom-
3
en’s Armed Services Integration Act of 1948, which 
4
formally authorized the appointment and enlistment 
5
of women in the regular components of the Armed 
6
Forces. 
7
(2) With the expansion of the Armed Forces to 
8
include women, the possibility arose for the first 
9
time that members of the regular components of the 
10
Armed Forces could become pregnant. 
11
(3) The response to such possibilities and actu-
12
alities was Executive Order 10240, signed by Presi-
13
dent Harry S. Truman in 1951, which granted the 
14
Armed Forces the authority to involuntarily separate 
15
or discharge a woman if she became pregnant, gave 
16
birth to a child, or became a parent by adoption or 
17
a stepparent. 
18
(4) The Armed Forces responded to the Execu-
19
tive order by systematically discharging any woman 
20
in the Armed Forces who became pregnant, regard-
21
less of whether the pregnancy was planned, un-
22
planned, or the result of sexual abuse. 
23
(5) Although the Armed Forces were required 
24
to offer women who were involuntarily separated or 
25
discharged due to pregnancy the opportunity to re-
26
00:46 May 27, 2021

•HR 2385 IH
quest retention in the military, many such women 
1
were not offered such opportunity. 
2
(6) The Armed Forces did not provide required 
3
separation benefits, counseling, or assistance to the 
4
members of the Armed Forces who were separated 
5
or discharged due to pregnancy. 
6
(7) Thousands of members of the Armed 
7
Forces were involuntarily separated or discharged 
8
from the Armed Forces as a result of pregnancy. 
9
(8) There are reports that the practice of the 
10
Armed Forces to systematically separate or dis-
11
charge pregnant members caused some such mem-
12
bers to seek an unsafe or inaccessible abortion, 
13
which was not legal at the time, or to put their chil-
14
dren up for adoption, and that, in some cases, some 
15
women died by suicide following their involuntary 
16
separation or discharge from the Armed Forces. 
17
(9) Such involuntary separation or discharge 
18
from the Armed Forces on the basis of pregnancy 
19
was challenged in Federal district court by Steph-
20
anie Crawford in 1975, whose legal argument stated 
21
that this practice violated her constitutional right to 
22
due process of law. 
23
(10) The Court of Appeals for the Second Cir-
24
cuit ruled in Stephanie Crawford’s favor in 1976 
25

•HR 2385 IH
and found that Executive Order 10240 and any reg-
1
ulations relating to the Armed Forces that made 
2
separation or discharge mandatory due to pregnancy 
3
were unconstitutional. 
4
(11) By 1976, all regulations that permitted in-
5
voluntary separation or discharge of a member of 
6
the Armed Forces because of pregnancy or any form 
7
of parenthood were rescinded. 
8
(12) Today, women comprise 17 percent of the 
9
Armed Forces, and many are parents, including 12 
10
percent of whom are single parents. 
11
(13) While military parents face many hard-
12
ships, today’s Armed Forces provides various lengths 
13
of paid family leave for mothers and fathers. for 
14
both birth and adoption of children. 
15
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
16
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
17
gress that women who served in the Armed Forces before

20
(b) EXPRESSION OF REMORSE.—Congress hereby ex-
21
presses deep remorse for the women who patriotically 
22
served in the Armed Forces, but were forced, by official 
23
United States policy, to endure unnecessary and discrimi-
24
natory actions, including the violation of their constitu-
25

tional right to due process of law, simply because they be-
1
came pregnant or became a parent while a member of the 
2
Armed Forces.
