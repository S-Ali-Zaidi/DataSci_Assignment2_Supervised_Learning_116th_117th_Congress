SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
The Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) In passing the Motor Carrier Act of 1980, 
3
Public Law 96–296, Congress intended for the min-
4
imum insurance levels to maintain safety. According 
5
to the House Report No. 96–1069, ‘‘the action of 
6
the Committee in increasing financial responsibility 
7
is to encourage the carriers to engage in practices 
8
and procedures that will enhance the safety of their 
9
equipment so as to afford the best protection to the 
10
public.’’. 
11
(2) The National Transportation Policy Study 
12
Commission (which consisted of six Members of the 
13
Senate, six Members of the House of Representa-
14
tives, and seven public members appointed by the 
15
President) recommended mandatory minimum insur-
16
ance requirements of $1,000,000, in its 1979 Final 
17
Report to the Congress, National Transportation 
18
Policies through the Year 2000. The Report stated: 
19
‘‘As an example, all certificated motor carriers oper-
20
ating upon the highways should be obligated to carry 
21
adequate insurance (or proof of financial responsi-
22
bility equal to such insurance) to protect the public. 
23
The insurance should cover public liability, property, 
24
damage, cargo and environmental restoration with a 
25
$1 million for single occurrence, or another min-

imum amount sufficient to require periodic ‘on site’ 
1
inspection by the insurance company, with the min-
2
imum to be updated regularly. Non-certificated 
3
motor carriers should be subject to similar stand-
4
ards.’’. 
5
(3) According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Sta-
6
tistics, the amount of $750,000, set in 1980 (the 
7
year of enactment), would have the same purchasing 
8
power as $5,193,665.62 in 2020, if the amount was 
9
raised to account for medical-cost inflation.
