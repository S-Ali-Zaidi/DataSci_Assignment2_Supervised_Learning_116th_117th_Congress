Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Fleet Reserve Associa-
4
tion 100th Anniversary Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
The Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) On November 11, 1924, the Fleet Reserve 
8
Association (FRA) was founded by Navy Chief Yeo-
9
man George L. Carlin and chartered in 1924 in

Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. FRA was born out of 
1
the need for an organization to protect the pay and 
2
benefits of enlisted Sea Service members and their 
3
families. 
4
(2) The Fleet Reserve Association (FRA) is a 
5
congressionally chartered, non-profit organization 
6
that represents the interests of the Sea Service com-
7
munity. Although the association was originally 
8
named for the Navy’s Fleet Reserve program, mem-
9
bership in FRA is open to all current and former 
10
sailors, marines, and Coast Guard personnel. 
11
(3) In 1930, FRA-proposed legislation was en-
12
acted that authorizes a death gratuity benefit of six 
13
months basic pay to the estates of recalled Fleet Re-
14
servists who subsequently die on active duty. 
15
(4) In 1932, FRA was successful in exempting 
16
enlisted personnel from Great Depression-era pay 
17
cuts that deferred pay for Federal employees by 8 
18
to 20 percent. 
19
(5) In 1934, FRA regained two-thirds of the 15 
20
percent pay cut authorized in the Economy Act of 
21
1933. The remaining 5 percent was restored in 
22
1935. 
23
(6) In 1935, FRA was successful in obtaining 
24
eligibility for Navy retirees and Fleet Reservists to 
25

receive emergency care in veterans’ hospitals in 
1
areas where military facilities were not available. 
2
(7) In 1937, FRA helped advance legislation 
3
that authorized commissary privileges for military 
4
widows. 
5
(8) In 1946, FRA was successful in estab-
6
lishing equity in disability compensation for disabled 
7
peacetime veterans with their wartime counterparts. 
8
(9) In 1950, FRA first proposed legislation to 
9
provide a survivor benefit program as part of the 
10
military retirement system. 
11
(10) In 1972, FRA played a major role in the 
12
enactment of the Widow’s Equity bill, the precursor 
13
of today’s Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) and FRA 
14
sponsored the Navy’s first Sailors of the Year com-
15
petition, a tradition that continues today. 
16
(11) In 1985, FRA became a founding member 
17
of The Military Coalition when laws threatened to 
18
significantly cut military retired pay. The FRA is 
19
one of 12 military and veterans organizations that 
20
banded together to reverse the potential loss of 22.5 
21
percent in cost-of-living adjustments (COLA) over a 
22
seven-year period.

•HR 6663 IH
(12) In 1986, FRA played a key role in restor-
1
ing full cost-of-living adjustments (COLA) for mili-
2
tary retirees. 
3
(13) In 1996, FRA became federally chartered 
4
as part of the National Defense Authorization Act 
5
for Fiscal Year 1997 (Public Law 104–201). 
6
(14) In 2002, the Bob Stump National Defense 
7
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003 (Public Law 
8
107–314) authorized combat-related special com-
9
pensation (CRSC) for disabled uniformed services 
10
retirees wounded in combat, which FRA acknowl-
11
edged as a significant first step toward full concur-
12
rent receipt of military retired pay and Department 
13
of Veterans Affairs disability compensation. 
14
(15) In 2009, the FRA Education Foundation 
15
was launched in conjunction with FRA’s 85th anni-
16
versary. 
17
(16) In 2013, FRA successfully defeated efforts 
18
to reduce future cost-of-living adjustments (COLA) 
19
for military retirees by blocking implementation of 
20
the chained consumer price index (CPI) in lieu of 
21
the current consumer price index (CPI). 
22
(17) November 11, 2024, will mark the 100th 
23
anniversary of the Fleet Reserve Association.
