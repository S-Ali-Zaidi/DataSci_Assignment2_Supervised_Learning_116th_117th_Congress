A BILL 
To promote and protect the human rights of Palestinians 
living under Israeli military occupation and to ensure 
that United States taxpayer funds are not used by the 
Government of Israel to support the military detention 
of Palestinian children, the unlawful seizure, appropria-
tion, and destruction of Palestinian property and forcible 
transfer of civilians in the West Bank, or further annex-
ation of Palestinian land in violation of international 
law.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Defending the Human 
4
Rights of Palestinian Children and Families Living Under 
5
Israeli Military Occupation Act’’. 
6
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
7
Congress finds the following: 
8
(1) Approximately 3,000,000 Palestinians live 
9
in the West Bank, of which around 45 percent are 
10
children under the age of 18 who have lived their en-
11
tire lives under Israeli military control. 
12
(2) In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, there 
13
are two separate and unequal legal systems, with 
14
Israeli military law imposed on Palestinians and 
15
Israeli civilian law applied to Israeli settlers. 
16
(3) Children are entitled to special protections 
17
and due process rights under international human 
18
rights law and international humanitarian law. 
19
(4) Israel has ratified the Convention on the 
20
Rights of the Child, which states— 
21
(A) in article 37(a), that ‘‘no child shall be 
22
subject to torture or other cruel, inhuman or 
23
degrading treatment or punishment’’; 
24
19:00 Jun 09, 2021
H2590
3 
•HR 2590 IH
(B) in article 37(b), that the arrest, deten-
1
tion or imprisonment of a child ‘‘shall be used 
2
only as a measure of last resort and for the 
3
shortest appropriate period of time’’; 
4
(C) in article 37(c), that ‘‘every child de-
5
prived of liberty shall be treated with humanity 
6
and respect for the inherent dignity of the 
7
human person, and in a manner which takes 
8
into account the needs of persons of his or her 
9
age’’; and 
10
(D) in article 37(d), that ‘‘[e]very child de-
11
prived of his or her liberty shall have the right 
12
to prompt access to legal and other appropriate 
13
assistance, as well as the right to challenge the 
14
legality of the deprivation of his or her liberty 
15
before a court or other competent, independent 
16
and impartial authority, and to a prompt deci-
17
sion on any such action’’. 
18
(5) The Government of Israel and its military 
19
detains around 500 to 700 Palestinian children be-
20
tween the ages of 12 and 17 each year and pros-
21
ecutes them before a military court system that 
22
lacks basic and fundamental guarantees of due proc-
23
ess in violation of international standards. 
24

•HR 2590 IH
(6) Israeli security forces detain children under 
1
the age of 12 for interrogation for extended periods 
2
of time even though the prosecution of children 
3
under 12 is prohibited by Israeli military law. 
4
(7) Human Rights Watch, in its World Report 
5
2020, reported that ‘‘Israel denied Palestinian chil-
6
dren arrested and detained in the West Bank legal 
7
protections granted to Israeli children, including set-
8
tlers, such as protections against nighttime arrests 
9
and interrogations without a guardian present. 
10
Israeli forces frequently used unnecessary force 
11
against children during arrest and physically abused 
12
them in custody.’’. 
13
(8) The Israeli human rights organization 
14
HaMoked: Center for the Defence of the Individual 
15
issued a report in October 2020 examining night ar-
16
rests of Palestinian children by Israeli forces in the 
17
West Bank finding that Israeli authorities continue 
18
‘‘to send soldiers to arrest Palestinian teenage boys 
19
at night as a measure of first resort for bringing 
20
them in for interrogation. This injurious, traumatic 
21
practice leaves the teenagers broken in body and 
22
soul, while thwarting the possibility of a fair interro-
23
gation and almost guaranteeing a conviction.’’.

•HR 2590 IH
(9) The Israeli human rights organization 
1
B’Tselem issued a report in 2018 describing the 
2
treatment of Palestinian children under Israeli mili-
3
tary occupation: ‘‘Every year, hundreds of Pales-
4
tinian minors undergo the same scenario. Israeli se-
5
curity forces pick them up on the street or at home 
6
in the middle of the night, then handcuff and blind-
7
fold them and transport them to interrogation, often 
8
subjecting them to violence en route. Exhausted and 
9
scared—some having spent a long time in transit, 
10
some having been roused from sleep, some having 
11
had nothing to eat or drink for hours—the minors 
12
are then interrogated. They are completely alone in 
13
there, cut off from the world, without any adult they 
14
know and trust by their side, and without having 
15
been given a chance to consult with a lawyer before 
16
the interrogation. The interrogation itself often in-
17
volves threats, yelling, verbal abuse and sometimes 
18
physical violence. Its sole purpose is to get the mi-
19
nors to confess or provide information about oth-
20
ers.’’. 
21
(10) The State Department’s 2016 Annual Re-
22
port on Human Rights Practices noted the renewed 
23
use of ‘‘administrative detention’’ against Palestin-
24
ians, including children, a practice in which a de-
25
19:00 Jun 09, 2021
H2590

•HR 2590 IH
tainee may be imprisoned indefinitely, without 
1
charge or trial, by the order of a military com-
2
mander or other government official. 
3
(11) The nongovernmental organization De-
4
fense for Children International-Palestine (DCIP) 
5
documented 36 Palestinian children detained and 
6
placed in administrative detention, or detention 
7
without charge or trial, since Israel renewed the 
8
practice against minors in October 2015. 
9
(12) DCIP collected affidavits from 610 West 
10
Bank children who were detained by Israeli forces 
11
from the West Bank between 2016 and 2020, and 
12
concluded that— 
13
(A) 73 percent of the children endured 
14
physical violence following arrest; 
15
(B) under Israeli military law, children do 
16
not have the right to a lawyer during interroga-
17
tion; 
18
(C) 97 percent of the children did not have 
19
a parent present during their interrogation; 
20
(D) 67 percent of the children were not 
21
properly informed of their rights by Israeli po-
22
lice; 
23
19:00 Jun 09, 2021
H2590
7 
•HR 2590 IH
(E) interrogators used stress positions, 
1
threats of violence, and isolation to coerce con-
2
fessions from detained children; and 
3
(F) 135 children were held in pre-trial, 
4
pre-charge isolation for interrogation purposes 
5
for an average period of 15 days. 
6
(13) Amendments to Israeli military law con-
7
cerning the detention of Palestinian children have 
8
had little or no impact on the treatment of children 
9
during the first 24 to 48 hours after an arrest, when 
10
the majority of their ill treatment occurs. 
11
(14) Israel’s drive to perpetuate its control over 
12
the occupied West Bank results in other serious vio-
13
lations of international law, including the unlawful 
14
demolition of Palestinian homes and the forcible 
15
transfer of Palestinian civilians. 
16
(15) The destruction of property in an occupied 
17
territory is prohibited under international humani-
18
tarian law, unless absolutely necessary for military 
19
operations. 
20
(16) The Israeli Committee Against Home 
21
Demolitions reports that Israel has demolished more 
22
than 48,000 Palestinian structures since 1967, of 
23
which 24,000 are estimated to be homes. 
24
19:00 Jun 09, 2021

•HR 2590 IH
(17) Palestinian properties are subject to demo-
1
lition or confiscation as part of Israeli-imposed plan-
2
ning and zoning regimes in Area C and East Jeru-
3
salem and other parts of the West Bank, and sub-
4
ject to punitive demolition following an incident of 
5
violence against Israeli military and police forces, 
6
settlers, or other civilians. 
7
(18) Palestinians are required to obtain Israeli- 
8
issued building permits and the lack of permits is 
9
typically cited as the reason for demolitions or 
10
confiscations, even though, due to the restrictive and 
11
discriminatory Israeli planning regime, Palestinians 
12
are overwhelmingly denied permits and therefore 
13
forced to build without the necessary permits. 
14
(19) From 2016 to 2018, 98.6 percent of the 
15
1,485 building permit applications that were sub-
16
mitted by Palestinians in Area C were rejected, with 
17
only 21 applications approved. 
18
(20) Palestinians are allowed to build in less 
19
than one percent of Area C and in only about 15 
20
percent of East Jerusalem. 
21
(21) Palestinian homes and structures located 
22
in Area C and East Jerusalem and other parts of 
23
the West Bank are under constant threat of demoli-
24
19:00 Jun 09, 2021

•HR 2590 IH
tion from the moment construction begins and are 
1
often demolished with little notice. 
2
(22) The United Nations Office for the Coordi-
3
nation for Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported 
4
in January 2021 that during 2020, Israeli authori-
5
ties demolished or seized 851 structures across the 
6
West Bank, including East Jerusalem, displacing 
7
1001 Palestinians as a result, including over 524 
8
children. This is the highest number of home 
9
demolitions since 2016. 
10
(23) OCHA noted that one of the major trends 
11
observed in 2020 was the increased use of military 
12
orders and other legislation, preventing or limiting 
13
the ability of Palestinians to legally challenge the 
14
targeting of their homes and sources of livelihood in 
15
Israeli courts. 
16
(24) OCHA reported in February 2021 that 53 
17
schools in the West Bank, which are attended by 
18
5,200 children, are subject to demolition orders 
19
issued by Israeli authorities. 
20
(25) Demolitions clearly and deliberately under-
21
mine the prospects for a just and lasting peace be-
22
tween Israel and the Palestinians and create oppres-
23
sive conditions that leave Palestinians with no other 
24
choice than to leave their homes and lands. 
25
19:00 Jun 09, 2021
H2590
10 
•HR 2590 IH
(26) Punitive demolitions function as an act of 
1
collective punishment against the families of sus-
2
pects or perpetrators and create insecurity in the 
3
surrounding communities. Though Israeli authorities 
4
maintain that punitive demolitions are a means of 
5
achieving security, Israel does not demolish the 
6
homes of Israelis who have committed crimes 
7
against Palestinians as part of its policy. 
8
(27) The restrictive and discriminatory Israeli 
9
planning regime undermines rights and guarantees 
10
in international human rights law and international 
11
humanitarian law and facilitates unlawful acts and 
12
policies, including destruction of property and forc-
13
ible transfer of civilians, expropriation of land and 
14
natural resources, illegal settlement expansion, and 
15
further annexation of Palestinian land. 
16
(28) Jewish-only settlements established by the 
17
Government of Israel in the occupied West Bank, in-
18
cluding East Jerusalem, have no legal validity and 
19
constitute a flagrant violation under international 
20
law and a major obstacle to the achievement of a 
21
just and lasting peace between Israel and the Pal-
22
estinians. 
23
(29) Unilateral annexation of any part of the 
24
occupied West Bank by the Government of Israel is 
25

a flagrant violation of international law and a pro-
1
hibited act of aggression under Article 2(4) of the 
2
United Nations Charter. 
3
(30) Israel is the largest cumulative recipient of 
4
United States foreign assistance since World War II, 
5
receiving from the United States $146,000,000,000 
6
(current, or noninflation-adjusted, dollars) in bilat-
7
eral assistance and military funding. 
8
(31) In 2016, the United States and Israeli 
9
governments signed a new 10-year Memorandum of 
10
Understanding (MOU) on military assistance, cov-
11
ering fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2028. 
12
(32) Under the terms of the MOU, the United 
13
States pledges to provide $38,000,000,000 in mili-
14
tary assistance ($33,000,000,000 in Foreign Mili-
15
tary Financing grants plus $5,000,000,000 in mis-
16
sile defense appropriations) to Israel, replacing a 
17
previous $30,000,000,000, 10-year agreement that 
18
ran through fiscal year 2018. 
19
(33) The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 
20
2021 (Public Law 116–260), provides the following 
21
for Israel: 
22
(A) $3,300,000,000 in Foreign Military 
23
Financing (FMF), including $795,300,000 mil-
24

3

(C) Reauthorization of War Reserve Stock 
5
Allies-Israel (WRSA–I) through 2023.

(D) $500,000,000 in missile defense, of

$73,000,000 
is 
for 
Iron

8
$177,000,000 for David’s Sling, $77,000,000 
9
for Arrow 3, and $173,000,000 for Arrow 2. 
10
(34) The sale and export of United States-ori-
11
gin defense articles and defense services to foreign 
12
countries are governed by an extensive set of laws, 
13
regulations, policies, and procedures, including au-
14
thorizations and reporting requirements in both the 
15
National Defense Authorization Acts and in the 
16
State Department, Foreign Operations, and Related 
17
Programs Appropriations Acts. 
18
(35) Congress has authorized sales to the Gov-
19
ernment of Israel under the Foreign Assistance Act 
20
of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151, et seq.) and the Arms Ex-
21
port Control Act of 1976 (22 U.S.C. 2751, et seq.). 
22
(36) The Arms Export Control Act of 1976 (22 
23
U.S.C. 271, et seq.) generally prohibits foreign coun-
24
tries from using funds made available under the Act

for procurement outside the United States. However, 
1
each year since 1991, varying amounts of FMF 
2
grants have been designated for offshore procure-
3
ments in Israel. 
4
(37) In 1991, the Government Accountability 
5
Office, formerly the General Accounting Office, 
6
issued a report to the Committee on Foreign Rela-
7
tions of the Senate examining United States military 
8
funding to Israel, which specifically audited Israel’s 
9
expenditures for offshore procurements and assessed 
10
whether the executive branch had complied with leg-
11
islative requirements.
