SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Russia Cryptocurrency 
2
Transparency Act’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) On February 24, 2022, the Government of 
6
the Russian Federation, led by Vladimir Putin, 
7
launched an unprovoked, full-scale invasion of 
8
Ukraine. 
9
(2) This unprovoked act of aggression violates 
10
Ukraine’s right to independence, sovereignty, and 
11
territorial integrity, and constitutes an emergency in 
12
international relations. 
13
(3) The invasion by the Government of the 
14
Russian Federation of Ukraine caused significant 
15
displacement in Ukraine and triggered a broader hu-
16
manitarian crisis in Europe. 
17
(4) On March 23, 2022, the Department of 
18
State released a statement assessing that the Rus-
19
sian Armed Forces committed war crimes by launch-
20
ing indiscriminate attacks on civilians and non-mili-
21
tary infrastructure, including apartment buildings, 
22
schools, and hospitals, leaving thousands of innocent 
23
civilians killed or wounded. 
24
(5) The United Nations Office for Coordination 
25
of Humanitarian Affairs has projected that, over the 
26
16:48 Apr 04, 2022
H7338

•HR 7338 IH
next three months, 12,000,000 people living in 
1
Ukraine 
will 
need 
humanitarian 
assistance, 
2
6,700,000 people will be internally displaced, and 
3
4,000,000 people will flee Ukraine. 
4
(6) Rapid humanitarian assistance is necessary 
5
across sectors to address the needs of refugees and 
6
internally displaced persons from Ukraine. 
7
(7) Cryptocurrency has been used as an effec-
8
tive cross-border payment tool to send millions to 
9
the Ukrainian Government, Ukrainian army, and 
10
Ukrainian refugees with limited access to financial 
11
services. 
12
(8) In response to the war of aggression by the 
13
Government of the Russian Federation, the United 
14
States has imposed an array of sanctions, cutting off 
15
major Russian financial institutions from Western 
16
markets and freezing the assets of numerous Rus-
17
sian oligarchs. 
18
(9) Given the growing development and adop-
19
tion of blockchain technologies and digital cur-
20
rencies, there are increasing concerns that digital as-
21
sets, such as cryptocurrencies, may be used to cir-
22
cumvent the United States sanctions regime, as well 
23
as those of foreign countries.
