To provide for a Federal partnership to ensure educational 
equity and quality. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Transformational Re-

Urgent Investments in Today’s Youth Act of 2021’’ or the

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 779 IH
(1) The fate of our Nation and the opportuni-
1
ties it creates for our children and grandchildren to 
2
enjoy successful careers and rewarding lives depends 
3
on the quality, equal access, and effectiveness of pre- 
4
kindergarten through twelfth grade education in 
5
every local school district across the country. 
6
(2) Our education systems must prepare stu-
7
dents to compete in an interconnected, global econ-
8
omy. 
9
(3) Despite the current combinations of Fed-
10
eral, State, and local funding and innovative edu-
11
cational policies, States with historically well re-
12
garded kindergarten through grade 12 education 
13
systems may find their students falling behind their 
14
peers nationally and internationally. In Maryland, a 
15
State with a historically well regarded kindergarten 
16
through grade 12 education system, fourth and 
17
eighth graders placed in the middle of the pack na-
18
tionally in reading and math scores on the National 
19
Assessment of Education Progress. 
20
(4) The United States as a whole scored well 
21
down the second quartile among students from 72 
22
countries on the Programme for International Stu-
23
dent Assessment.

•HR 779 IH
(5) Even in States with reading and math 
1
scores higher than the national average, there may 
2
be significant and persistent racial, ethnic, and in-
3
come disparity gaps between students of color and 
4
low-income students compared to their higher in-
5
come and white peers. 
6
(6) These same disparities carry into college en-
7
rollment, with fewer students of color and low-in-
8
come students enrolling in college than their higher 
9
income and white peers. 
10
(7) The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) health 
11
pandemic forced the physical closure of schools na-
12
tionwide in March 2020, moving students from the 
13
classroom to online learning. The public health ne-
14
cessity to turn to online learning further exacerbated 
15
the significant and persistent racial, ethnic, and in-
16
come disparity learning gaps as students struggled 
17
to access educational technology devices and the 
18
internet. 
19
(8) At the start of online learning, Maryland 
20
school districts reported that on average, nearly 25 
21
percent of Maryland students had not logged into 
22
their new online classrooms or picked up paper work 
23
packets, falling out of sight and behind their peers.

•HR 779 IH
(9) Millions of children are falling further be-
1
hind as a result of opportunity gaps that fail to pro-
2
vide students with ready access to individualized in-
3
struction, healthy meals, mental health counseling 
4
services, and hands on career training programs. 
5
(10) In order to address these inequities in edu-
6
cation and harm caused by COVID-19, certain 
7
States, including Maryland, have researched and 
8
proposed bold, transformative Federal, State, and 
9
local funding and policy changes to their pre-kinder-
10
garten through twelfth grade education systems, 
11
with five main policy recommendations under the 
12
Maryland Commission on Innovation & Excellence in 
13
Education that include the following: 
14
(A) Investing in high-quality early child-
15
hood education and care through a significant 
16
expansion of full day pre-school, to be free for 
17
all low-income three- and four-year-olds, so that 
18
all children have the opportunity to begin kin-
19
dergarten ready to learn. 
20
(B) Investing in teachers and school lead-
21
ers by elevating the standards and status of the 
22
teaching profession, including a performance- 
23
based career ladder and salaries comparable to 
24
17:28 Feb 24, 2021

•HR 779 IH
other fields with similar education require-
1
ments. 
2
(C) Creating a world-class instructional 
3
system with an internationally benchmarked 
4
curriculum that enables most students to 
5
achieve ‘‘college and career ready’’ status by 
6
10th grade and then pursue pathways that in-
7
clude 
early 
college, 
Advanced 
Placement 
8
courses, or a rigorous technical education lead-
9
ing to industry-recognized credentials and high 
10
paying jobs. 
11
(D) Providing supports to students that 
12
need it the most with broad and sustained sup-
13
port for schools serving high concentrations of 
14
poverty, with after school and summer academic 
15
programs and student access to needed health 
16
and social services. 
17
(E) Ensuring excellence for all through an 
18
accountability-oversight board that has the au-
19
thority to ensure transformative education sys-
20
tem recommendations are successfully imple-
21
mented and produce the desired improvements 
22
in student achievement.

It is the sense of Congress that—

•HR 779 IH
(1) no matter a child’s zip code, they deserve 
1
equal access to a quality, public pre-kindergarten 
2
through twelfth grade education; 
3
(2) no inequities in student achievement, college 
4
enrollment, or Federal, State, and local funding

should be tolerated;

(3) the Federal Government should live up to 
7
its original commitment in 1975 under the Individ-
8

9
1400 et seq.) to provide 40 percent of the cost to 
10
educate children with disabilities and assist State 
11
educational agencies and local educational agencies 
12
in providing a free appropriate public education; and 
13
(4) the Federal Government should be an active 
14
partner with State educational agencies and local 
15
educational agencies that are willing to modify poli-
16
cies and commit additional State and local resources 
17
to address education inequities.
