Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

Congress finds the following:

•HR 5779 IH
(1) Nearly 43,000,000 people owe an average of 
1
$36,406 in Federal student loans, and student loan 
2
debt 
in 
the 
United 
States 
totals 
3
$1,730,000,000,000, growing 6 times faster than 
4
the Nation’s economy. 
5
(2) Student debt has significant racial equity 
6
implications. Almost half of Black college students 
7
are using Federal student loans to cover educational 
8
costs, and Black college graduates are still substan-
9
tially more likely than white college graduates to de-
10
fault on their debt within 4 years of graduation (7.6 
11
percent versus 2.4 percent of white graduates). In 
12
addition, 4 years after graduation, 48 percent of 
13
Black students owe an average of 12.5 percent more 
14
than they borrowed. Students who are veterans, par-
15
ents, first-generation college students, or low income 
16
are also likely to face higher risk of default. 
17
(3) Since before the COVID–19 pandemic, 
18
about 23 percent of Hispanic and Latino college 
19
graduates who had taken out loans for tuition and 
20
school expenses were behind on their payments, in 
21
contrast with 6 percent of white student borrowers. 
22
Hispanic and Latino borrowers also were the most 
23
likely to delay getting married and having children 
24
due to student loan debt.

(4) Native American financial status remains 
1
among the lowest of all minority populations in the 
2
Nation. Native people are the least likely of all popu-
3
lation groups, including other minorities, to plan for 
4
retirement, have an emergency fund, or have a 
5
checking account. Native American and Alaska Na-
6
tive borrowers take on student loan debt at a rate 
7
higher than the overall population, 76 percent com-
8
pared to 69 percent. 
9
(5) Among college graduates with any out-
10
standing debt for their education, first-generation 
11
college graduates tend to owe more. About two- 
12
thirds of first-generation college graduates owe at 
13
least $25,000 or more, compared with 57 percent of 
14
second-generation college graduates, and 200,000 
15
United 
States 
service 
members 
owe 
nearly 
16
$3,000,000,000 in student loans. 
17
(6) Student debt among older adults has stead-
18
ily increased, with many individuals taking on debt 
19
to finance higher education for their children and 
20
grandchildren. 
21
(7) Despite the fact that many students and 
22
families must make substantial and highly con-
23
sequential decisions about student loan borrowing 
24
and face growing college affordability challenges, less 
25

than half of States make personal finance a core 
1
part of basic education. 
2
(8) Just over 2 in 10 non-retirees under age 45 
3
have retirement savings that meet their age-specific 
4
thresholds. 42 percent of Americans age 18–29 have 
5
no retirement savings; 26 percent of those age 30– 
6
44; 17 percent of those age 45–59; and 13 percent 
7
of those over age 60. 
8
(9) People with self-directed retirement savings 
9
(nearly 7 in 10 non-retired adults) must make deci-
10
sions about how the money is invested. Six in 10 
11
non-retirees with these self-directed accounts express 
12
low levels of comfort in making investment decisions 
13
with their retirement savings. 
14
(10) The COVID–19 pandemic exacerbated the 
15
need to provide families with better tools to weather 
16
financial challenges, with a rapid spike in unemploy-
17
ment occurring in mid-2020, along with significant 
18
shifts to individuals’ housing and transportation 
19
needs. 
20
(11) Nearly 1 in 10 student loan borrowers end 
21
up in default, and even more struggle to repay their 
22
loans, indicating an important need to ensure bor-
23
rowers can access information to help them navigate 
24
repayment and succeed financially.
