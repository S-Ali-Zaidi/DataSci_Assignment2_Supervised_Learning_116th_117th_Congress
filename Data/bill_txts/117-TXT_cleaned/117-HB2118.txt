A BILL 
To authorize United States participation in the Coalition 
for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, and for other 
purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Securing America

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) Due to increasing population and popu-

change, emerging infectious diseases pose a real and 
1
growing threat to global health security. 
2
(2) While vaccines can be the most effective 
3
tools to protect against infectious disease, the ab-
4
sence of vaccines for a new or emerging infectious 
5
disease with epidemic potential is a major health se-
6
curity threat globally, posing catastrophic potential 
7
human and economic costs. 
8
(3) The COVID–19 pandemic has infected more 
9
than 119,960,700 individuals and has killed at least 
10
2,656,822 people worldwide, and it is likely that un-
11
reported cases and deaths are significant. 
12
(4) Even regional outbreaks can have enormous 
13
human costs and substantially disrupt the global 
14
economy and cripple regional economies. The 2014 
15
Ebola outbreak in West Africa killed more than 
16
11,000 and cost $2,800,000,000 in losses in the af-
17
fected countries alone. 
18
(5) While the need for vaccines to address 
19
emerging epidemic threats is acute, markets to drive 
20
the necessary development of vaccines to address 
21
them—a complex and expensive undertaking—are 
22
very often critically absent. Also absent are mecha-
23
nisms to ensure access to those vaccines by those 
24
who need them when they need them.

(6) To address this global vulnerability and the 
1
deficit of political commitment, institutional capac-
2
ity, and funding, in 2017, several countries and pri-
3
vate partners launched the Coalition for Epidemic 
4
Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). CEPI’s mission 
5
is to stimulate, finance, and coordinate development 
6
of vaccines for high-priority, epidemic-potential 
7
threats in cases where traditional markets do not 
8
exist or cannot create sufficient demand. 
9
(7) Through funding of partnerships, CEPI 
10
seeks to bring priority vaccines candidates through 
11
the end of phase II clinical trials, as well as support 
12
vaccine platforms that can be rapidly deployed 
13
against emerging pathogens. 
14
(8) CEPI supported the manufacturing of the 
15
United States-developed Moderna COVID–19 vac-
16
cine during its Phase 1 clinical trial, and CEPI has 
17
initiated at least 12 partnerships to develop vaccines 
18
against COVID–19. 
19
(9) CEPI is co-leading COVAX, the vaccines 
20
pillar of the ACT–Accelerator, which is a global col-
21
laboration to quickly produce and equitably dis-
22
tribute safe and effective vaccines and therapeutics 
23
for COVID–19.

(10) Support for and participation in CEPI is 
1
an important part of the United States own health 
2
security and biodefense and is in the national inter-
3
est, complementing the work of many Federal agen-
4
cies and providing significant value through global 
5
partnership and burden-sharing.
