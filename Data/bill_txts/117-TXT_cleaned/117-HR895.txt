RESOLUTION 
Strongly condemning ongoing violence and human rights 
abuses stemming from Cameroon’s Anglophone crisis. 
Whereas many Anglophone Cameroonians have long felt 
marginalized by official actions and policies of the Gov-
ernment of Cameroon, including the abolishment of a fed-
eral form of government, which was the constitutional 
basis under which English-speaking Southern Cameroons 
entered into the union, and replacing it with a unitary 
state dominated by the Francophone majority; 
Whereas, beginning in late 2016, protests organized by law-
yers, teachers, and students were violently repressed by 
the Government of Cameroon, leading to numerous 
deaths and imprisonments, including of journalists, 
teachers, lawyers, and an Anglophone judge on the coun-
try’s Supreme Court;

Whereas the conflict escalated in late September and early 
October 2017, when Cameroonian security forces brutally 
cracked down on peaceful Anglophone civilian demonstra-
tors, resulting in dozens of deaths and leaving over 100 
injured; 
Whereas, since 2017, separatists launched a campaign to 
pressure school officials in the Northwest and Southwest 
Anglophone regions to go on strike as part of a boycott 
against the Government of Cameroon, and have been re-
portedly— 
(1) burning, damaging, looting, and destroying 
school buildings; 
(2) killing, beating, abducting, threatening, and ter-
rorizing students and educational professionals with vio-
lence if they did not comply with a boycott; 
(3) harassing and intimidating families into keeping 
their children out of school; and 
(4) kidnapping for ransom children and teachers 
who defied the boycott in various schools, such as Kumbo 
(Bui division), Fundong (Boyo division) and Limbe 
(Fako division); 
Whereas numerous human rights monitors have documented 
armed separatists killing traditional leaders and targeting 
civilians, including women, children, and the elderly, who 
are perceived to be supporting or working with the Gov-
ernment of Cameroon, and reports indicate that armed 
separatists have killed scores of security force personnel; 
Whereas numerous credible reports from human rights mon-
itors, including the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights, have documented the excessive use of 
force by government security forces against Cameroonian 
civilians living in the Anglophone regions, including the

burning of villages, the use of live ammunition against 
protestors, arbitrary arrest and detention, torture, sexual 
abuse, and killing of civilians, including women, children, 
and the elderly; 
Whereas the Department of State has expressed serious con-
cern over the manner in which the Government of Cam-
eroon has used force to unlawfully restrict the rights to 
free expression and peaceful protest that are protected 
under the Cameroonian Constitution and international 
law; 
Whereas the Government of Cameroon has charged journal-
ists, social activists, and members of political opposition 
parties with terrorism-related crimes and prosecuted 
them in military tribunals; 
Whereas the indiscriminate nature of violent clashes between 
Cameroonian security forces and separatist groups often 
results in the death of innocent bystanders, including 
American missionary Charles Wesco, who was killed in 
October 2018 by crossfire in the Northwestern city of 
Bamenda; 
Whereas the Government of Cameroon arrested over 500 
members and supporters of the opposition Cameroon 
Renaissance Movement (MRC) following peaceful protests 
in September 2020, and allegedly subjected many detain-
ees to harsh and inhumane detention conditions, includ-
ing isolated imprisonment, denial of access to lawyers, 
and physical abuse; 
Whereas over 100 of those arrested in late 2020 remain in 
detention, including 47 sentenced to prison in December 
2021;

Whereas the Government of Cameroon continued to place 
bans on MRC’s attempts to hold peaceful protests, and 
civil society reported that security forces interfered with 
MRC registration processes in Yaounde´, Douala, and 
Bafoussam in February 2019; 
Whereas the Government of Cameroon has repeatedly re-
stricted freedoms of expression by shutting down the 
internet, harassing and detaining journalists, refusing li-
censes to independent media, and intensifying political 
attacks against the independent press; 
Whereas the United Nations High Commissioner for Refu-
gees estimated that as of December 2021, more than 
575,500 people were internally displaced in areas affected 
by the Anglophone conflict, and there were an additional 
383,500 returnees to the Northwest and Southwest re-
gions; 
Whereas the Office of the United Nations High Commis-
sioner for Refugees reports that roughly 72,000 
Cameroonian refugees have registered in Nigeria; 
Whereas, on July 23, 2019, the House of Representatives 
unanimously passed House Resolution 358, calling on the 
Government of Cameroon and armed groups to respect 
the human rights of all Cameroonian citizens, to end all 
violence, and to pursue a broad-based dialogue without 
preconditions to resolve the conflict in the Northwest and 
Southwest regions; 
Whereas, effective January 1, 2020, the Trump Administra-
tion terminated Cameroon’s eligibility for African Growth 
and Opportunity Act (AGOA) benefits, citing deep con-
cerns over ‘‘persistent gross violations of human rights

being committed by the Cameroonian government against 
its own citizens’’; 
Whereas, on June 7, 2021, the United States responded to 
continued conflict in Cameroon by imposing visa restric-
tions on individuals undermining the peaceful resolution 
of the ongoing crisis; 
Whereas a prominent Cameroonian lawyer and opposition 
member of the senate, Henry Kemende was shot dead by 
suspected separatist fighters in the city of Bamenda on 
January 11, 2022; and 
Whereas multiple brutal massacres have taken place and alle-
gations of rape and gross violations of internationally rec-
ognized human rights continue, and as of December 
2021, Human Rights Watch estimated that at least 
4,000 lives have been lost during the crisis since late 
2016: Now, therefore, be it
