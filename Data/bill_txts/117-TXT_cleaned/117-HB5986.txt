To improve men’s health initiatives, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Men’s Health Aware-
4
ness and Improvement Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Risks to the health and well-being of the 
8
Nation’s men (and our families) are on the rise due

to a lack of education on, awareness of, and pursuit 
1
of preventive screening and care. For instance— 
2
(A) men are leading in 9 out of the top 10 
3
causes of death; 
4
(B) the life expectancy gap persists with 
5
the average age of death for men being 76.2 
6
years versus 81.2 years for women; and 
7
(C) in the United States, men die at an 
8
overall rate 1.4 times higher than women. 
9
(2) While this health crisis is of particular con-
10
cern to men, it is also a concern for women regard-
11
ing their fathers, husbands, sons, and brothers. 
12
(3) Men’s health is a concern to the Federal 
13
Government and State governments, which absorb 
14
the enormous costs of premature death and dis-
15
ability, including the costs of caring for dependents 
16
who are left behind. 
17
(4) According to the Social Security Adminis-
18
tration, 16.3 percent of widows age 65 and over are 
19
impoverished, compared to 4.9 percent of married 
20
women age 65 and over. 
21
(5) Educating men, their families, and health 
22
care providers about the importance of early detec-
23
tion of health issues that can impact men, such as 
24
cardiovascular disease, mental health, HIV/AIDS, 
25

•HR 5986 IH
osteoporosis, cancer (lung, prostate, skin, colorectal, 
1
testicular, and more), and other pertinent health 
2
issues, can result in reducing rates of mortality of 
3
diseases impacting males, as well as improve the 
4
health of the Nation’s males and its overall economic 
5
well-being. 
6
(6) Of concern is the physical, mental, and 
7
emotional well-being of our military men (and 
8
women) returning from war zones and our veterans. 
9
(7) Recent scientific studies have shown that 
10
regular medical exams, preventive screenings, reg-
11
ular exercise, and healthy eating habits can save 
12
lives. 
13
(8) According to the American Foundation for 
14
Suicide Prevention, men are nearly four times as 
15
likely to commit suicide. 
16
(9) Appropriate use of tests such as prostate 
17
cancer screening exams, blood pressure tests, blood 
18
glucose testing, lipid panel testing, and colorectal 
19
screenings, in conjunction with clinical exams or 
20
self-testing, can result in the early detection of many 
21
problems and increased survival rates. 
22
(10) Men’s health is a concern for employers 
23
who pay the costs of medical care and lose produc-
24
tive employees.

(11) According to the National Cancer Insti-
1
tute, cancer mortality is higher among men than 
2
women (185.5 per 100,000 men and 133.5 per 
3
100,000 women). 
4
(12) In 2018, national expenditures for cancer 
5
care in the United States were $150.8 billion. 
6
(13) Prostate cancer is the most frequently di-
7
agnosed cancer in the United States among men. 
8
One in 9 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer 
9
in their lifetime. This year alone, over 248,530 men 
10
will be newly diagnosed with prostate cancer and 
11
34,130 men with prostate cancer will die. Costs as-
12
sociated with prostate cancer detection and treat-
13
ments were $15.3 billion in 2018 in the United 
14
States and such costs are estimated to increase. 
15
Prostate cancer rates increase sharply with age, and 
16
more than 90 percent of such cases are diagnosed in 
17
men age 55 and older. The incidence of prostate 
18
cancer is 50 percent higher in African-American 
19
men, who are twice as likely to die from such cancer. 
20
There are over 3,100,000 men in the United States 
21
living with prostate cancer. 
22
(14) It is estimated that, in 2021, approxi-
23
mately 119,100 men in the United States will be di-
24

•HR 5986 IH
agnosed with lung cancer, and an estimated 69,410 
1
men will die from lung cancer. 
2
(15) It is estimated that, in 2021, approxi-
3
mately 79,520 men in the United States will be di-
4
agnosed with colorectal cancer, and 28,520 men will 
5
die from colorectal cancer. 
6
(16) Men make up over half the diabetes pa-
7
tients aged 18 and over in the United States (17.9 
8
million men total) and over 1⁄3 of them don’t know 
9
it. Approximately 34.2 million people in the United 
10
States are living with diabetes, and men are more 
11
likely to die from the disease. In the United States, 
12
88 million people aged 18 and older, 40.9 million 
13
men, and 47.1 million women have prediabetes. Peo-
14
ple with diagnosed diabetes have medical expendi-
15
tures that are 2.3 times higher than patients with-
16
out diabetes, and the estimated cost of diabetes in 
17
2017 was $327 million. 
18
(17) A research study found that premature 
19
death and morbidity in men costs Federal, State, 
20
and local governments in excess of $142 billion an-
21
nually. It also costs United States employers, and 
22
society as a whole, in excess of $156 billion annually 
23
and an additional $181 billion annually in decreased 
24
quality of life.

(18) Over 9,470 men will be diagnosed in 2021 
1
with testicular cancer, and 440 of these men will die 
2
from this disease. A common reason for delay in 
3
treatment of this disease is a delay in seeking med-
4
ical attention after discovering a testicular mass. 
5
(19) Men over the past decade have shown 
6
poorer health outcomes than women across all racial 
7
and ethnic groups as well as socioeconomic status. 
8
(20) Healthy fathers can be role models for 
9
their children, leading by example, and encouraging 
10
them to lead healthy lifestyles. 
11
(21) Establishing an Office of Men’s Health is 
12
needed to investigate these findings and take further 
13
action to promote awareness of men’s health needs.
