SEC. 101. FINDINGS.

The Congress finds the following:

•HR 159 IH
(1) Currently, over 80 percent of our Nation’s 
1
population lives in urban areas. 
2
(2) Economic competitiveness, which includes 
3
the ability to create jobs, stimulate growth, attract 
4
businesses, investment, tourism, and a highly skilled 
5
workforce, is closely related to the availability of 
6
fully functional park and recreation systems in 
7
America’s metropolitan areas. 
8
(3) According to the American Society of Civil 
9
Engineers, parks, beaches, and other recreational fa-
10
cilities contribute $730 billion per year to the U.S. 
11
economy, support nearly 6.5 million jobs, and con-
12
tribute to cleaner air and water and higher property 
13
values. 
14
(4) Despite spending on parks at the State and 
15
local levels, the acreage of parkland per resident in 
16
urban areas is declining due to rapid increases in 
17
population and to parks, such as Liberty State Park 
18
in New Jersey, being threatened by privatization. 
19
(5) A lack of access to public parks and recre-
20
ation areas and facilities, as well as deteriorating 
21
and unsafe play areas, leads to an increase in phys-
22
ical inactivity, which in turn contributes to higher 
23
rates of obesity. 
24
02:25 Feb 04, 2021
H159
4 
•HR 159 IH
(6) According to the Centers for Disease Con-
1
trol and Prevention, over the past 25 years, rates of 
2
obesity have more than tripled among adolescents 
3
ages 12 to 19 and doubled among adults ages 20 to 
4
74 and children ages 6 to 11. 
5
(7) Obesity and related health problems put a 
6
strain on our Nation’s economy, as the annual costs 
7
of medical spending and lost productivity from indi-
8
viduals in the United States being obese and over-
9
weight are estimated to be $147,000,000,000. 
10
(8) A study by the Centers for Disease Control 
11
found that the creation of, or enhanced access to, 
12
places for physical activity, such as parks, led to a 
13
25.6 percent increase in the percentage of people ex-
14
ercising on 3 or more days a week, which improves 
15
the physical and mental health of our citizens. 
16
(9) The guidelines of the Centers for Disease 
17
Control and Prevention for COVID-19 lists visiting 
18
parks close to home as a safe way to relieve stress, 
19
get some fresh air, and stay active, all of which are 
20
important for mental and physical health. 
21
(10) There are nearly 23 million veterans in the 
22
United States. Many have mental and physical dis-
23
abilities from injuries sustained during their service 
24
in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
25
02:25 Feb 04, 2021

•HR 159 IH
(11) Parks and recreation agencies are pro-
1
viding vital programs for veterans, with and without 
2
disabilities, and for their families, that provide phys-
3
ical, mental, and social benefits to improve their 
4
overall quality of life as they transition to civilian 
5
living. 
6
(12) According to the Juvenile Justice Bulletin, 
7
without structured, supervised activities in the after- 
8
school hours, youth are at greater risk of being vic-
9
tims of crime or participating in anti-social behav-
10
iors between 2:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. The peak hour 
11
for juvenile crime is between 3:00 p.m. and 4:00 
12
p.m., the first hour after most students are dis-
13
missed from school. Urban parks decrease juvenile 
14
delinquency by providing quality after-school pro-
15
grams during these critical hours. 
16
(13) Parks also add to the environmental viabil-
17
ity of communities. While cities currently spend tens 
18
of billions of dollars on treatment of storm water 
19
runoff and air pollution, studies have shown that 
20
parkland saves cities millions of dollars in storm 
21
water management and air pollution expenses by 
22
capturing precipitation, reducing runoff, and absorb-
23
ing air pollutants.
