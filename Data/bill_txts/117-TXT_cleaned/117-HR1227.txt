RESOLUTION 
Urging the development of a strategy to counter the rise 
in violent crime across the United States. 
Whereas rising crime, especially violent crime, in the United 
States poses a threat to the national interest, as well as 
to the safety and security of individuals, communities, 
businesses, law enforcement officers, and the rule of law; 
Whereas, for the purposes of the Uniform Crime Reporting 
Program of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, violent 
crimes consist of offenses that involve force or the threat 
of force, namely— 
(1) murder and non-negligent manslaughter;

•HRES 1227 IH 
(2) forcible rape; 
(3) robbery; and 
(4) aggravated assault; 
Whereas violent crimes are occurring every day in major cit-
ies across the United States in part due to progressive 
prosecutors declining to charge violent offenders and cer-
tain bail reform policies allowing dangerous criminals 
back into society; 
Whereas released offenders go on to commit more violent 
crimes and inflict more terror and death on other individ-
uals in the United States; 
Whereas rising violent crime destroys families and should be 
combated by criminal justice systems that prosecute the 
offenders as offenders, and not as victims; 
Whereas the murder rate in the United States rose 30 per-
cent between 2019 and 2020, the largest single-year in-
crease in more than a century; 
Whereas there was a 59-percent increase in murders of police 
officers in 2021; 
Whereas, as of April 1, 2022, 101 police officers had been 
shot this year, 17 of whom were killed by gunfire; 
Whereas at least 16 cities in the United States set murder 
records in 2021; 
Whereas organized retail crime threats in 2020 cost retailers 
an average of $720,000 for every $1,000,000,000 in 
sales, and 69 percent of retailers surveyed in 2021 had 
seen an increase in organized retail crime in 2021; 
Whereas organized retail crime threatens the safety of retail 
workers as organized crime groups, gangs, and individ-
uals use weapons other than guns, such as mace chemical

spray and Taser stun guns, to rob and assault hard- 
working retail employees; 
Whereas rising violent crime in the United States can be di-
rectly correlated to a surge in illegal immigration at the 
southern border of the United States and a surge in the 
sale, distribution, and consumption of illegal drugs; 
Whereas, in December 2021, 178,840 illegal immigrants were 
apprehended attempting to cross the United States-Mex-
ico border, the highest total for December in the history 
of the Department of Homeland Security, and a 142-per-
cent increase from December 2020; 
Whereas more than 2,500,000 illegal immigrants have been 
caught attempting to cross the United States-Mexico bor-
der since January 2021, with more apprehended in the 
3-month period from November 2021 through January 
2022 than in all of fiscal year 2020; 
Whereas 461 pounds of fentanyl were seized at the southern 
border in December 2021 alone, enough to kill more than 
30 percent of the United States population; 
Whereas drug cartels have overburdened Border Patrol re-
sources by surging illegal immigrants into strategic loca-
tions so that the cartels can traffic narcotics and other 
contraband into the United States undetected; 
Whereas violent crimes related to illegal immigration and the 
illegal drug trade must stop for the sake of the sov-
ereignty of the United States and the safety of the people 
of the United States; 
Whereas, with overdose deaths at an all-time high, every 
State is a border State, as the flow of illegal drugs from 
the United States-Mexico border puts all States at risk 
regardless of proximity to the border;

Whereas securing the southern border and ensuring the safe-
ty of citizens of the United States is one of the most im-
portant responsibilities of the Federal Government; 
Whereas the current Administration’s alleged violent crime 
reduction strategy is actually a gun control strategy and 
wrongly puts lawful gun owners and dealers at the center 
of enforcement efforts instead of focusing on the crimi-
nals perpetuating violence, insecurity, and fear across the 
United States; 
Whereas the same gun violence reduction strategy unfairly 
puts the blame for gun violence in major, Democrat-run 
cities and States on neighboring States with lower crime 
rates; and 
Whereas violent crimes can only be combated if the Depart-
ment of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, 
other law enforcement agencies, and the private sector 
work together: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-
1
resentatives that the President should work with Congress

to develop and execute a strategy, drawing on the multiple 
3
instruments of power and resources of the United

States—

(1) to counter the rise in violent crime across

the country by reinforcing strong criminal justice

policies, by laying blame on the perpetrators of vio-

lent acts, and by securing the southern border; and

(2) to coordinate with Federal, State, and local

agencies and authorities to—
