(1) The World Health Organization (WHO) is 
1
a specialized agency of the United Nations, charged 
2
with coordinating health efforts within the United 
3
Nations system. The World Health Assembly 
4
(WHA) is the decision-making body of the WHO, 
5
which convenes annually in May to set the policies 
6
and priorities of the organization. Statehood is not 
7
a requirement for attendance at the WHA, and nu-
8
merous observers, including non-members and non- 
9
governmental organizations, attended the most re-
10
cent virtual WHA in May 2020. 
11
(2) Taiwan began seeking to participate in the 
12
WHO as an observer in 1997. In 2009, with strong 
13
support from successive United States Administra-
14
tions, Congress, and like-minded WHO Member 
15
States, and during a period of improved Cross-Strait 
16
relations, Taiwan received an invitation to attend 
17
the WHA as an observer under the name ‘‘Chinese 
18
Taipei’’. Taiwan received the same invitation each 
19
year until 2016, when following the election of Presi-
20
dent Tsai-Ing Wen of the Democratic Progressive 
21
Party, Taiwan’s engagement in the international 
22
community began facing increased resistance from 
23
the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Taiwan’s in-
24
vitation to the 2016 WHA was received late and in-

cluded new language conditioning Taiwan’s partici-
1
pation on the PRC’s ‘‘one China principle’’. The 
2
WHO did not invite Taiwan to attend the WHA as 
3
an observer in 2017, 2018, 2019, or 2020. 
4
(3) Taiwan remains a model contributor to 
5
world health, having provided financial and technical 
6
assistance to respond to numerous global health 
7
challenges. Taiwan has invested over $6 billion in 
8
international medical and humanitarian aid efforts 
9
impacting over 80 countries since 1996. In 2014, 
10
Taiwan responded to the Ebola crisis by donating $1 
11
million and providing 100,000 sets of personal pro-
12
tective equipment. Through the Global Cooperation 
13
and Training Framework, the United States and 
14
Taiwan have jointly conducted training programs for 
15
experts to combat MERS, Dengue Fever, and Zika. 
16
In 2020, after successfully containing the spread of 
17
the novel coronavirus within its borders while up-
18
holding democratic principles, Taiwan generously do-
19
nated millions of pieces of personal protective equip-
20
ment and COVID-19 tests to countries in need. 
21
These diseases know no borders, and Taiwan’s need-
22
less exclusion from global health cooperation in-
23
creases the dangers presented by global pandemics.

(4) Taiwan’s international engagement has 
1
faced increased resistance from the PRC. Taiwan 
2
was not invited to the 2016 Assembly of the Inter-
3
national Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), despite 
4
participating as a guest at the organization’s prior 
5
summit in 2013. Taiwan’s requests to participate in 
6
the General Assembly of the International Criminal 
7
Police Organization (INTERPOL) have also been 
8
rejected. In May 2017, PRC delegates disrupted a 
9
meeting of the Kimberley Process on conflict dia-
10
monds held in Perth, Australia, until delegates from 
11
Taiwan were asked to leave. Since 2016, the Demo-
12
cratic Republic of Sa˜o Tome´ and Prı´ncipe, the Re-
13
public of Panama, the Dominican Republic, Burkina 
14
Faso, the Republic of El Salvador, the Solomon Is-
15
lands, and the Republic of Kiribati have terminated 
16
longstanding diplomatic relationships with Taiwan 
17
and granted diplomatic recognition to the PRC. 
18
(5) Congress has established a policy of support 
19
for Taiwan’s participation in international bodies 
20
that address shared transnational challenges, par-
21
ticularly in the WHO. Congress passed H.R. 1794 
22
in the 106th Congress, H.R. 428 in the 107th Con-
23
gress, and S. 2092 in the 108th Congress to direct 
24
the Secretary of State to establish a strategy for,

and to report annually to Congress on, efforts to ob-
1
tain observer status for Taiwan at the WHA. Con-
2
gress also passed H.R. 1151 in the 113th Congress, 
3
directing the Secretary to report on a strategy to 
4
gain observer status for Taiwan at the ICAO Assem-
5
bly, and H.R. 1853 in the 114th Congress, directing 
6
the Secretary to report on a strategy to gain ob-
7
server status for Taiwan at the INTERPOL Assem-
8
bly. However, since 2016 Taiwan has not received 
9
an invitation to attend any of these events as an ob-
10
server.
