A BILL 
To provide for the elimination of the Department of 
Education, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘States’ Education Rec-
4
lamation Act of 2021’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Principles of federalism embodied in the 
8
Constitution of the United States entrust authority 
9
over issues of educational policy to the States and 
10
04:54 May 19, 2021
H2106

•HR 2106 IH
the people and a Federal Department of Education 
1
is inconsistent with such principles. 
2
(2) Tradition and experience dictate that the 
3
governance and management of schools in the 
4
United States are best performed by parents, teach-
5
ers, and communities. 
6
(3) The education of the Nation’s students is 
7
suffering under a managerial government. 
8
(4) The Department of Education has weak-
9
ened the ability of parents to make essential deci-
10
sions about their children’s education and has un-
11
dermined the capacity of communities to govern 
12
their schools. 
13
(5) In the 41 years of its existence, the Depart-
14
ment of Education has grown from a budget of $14 
15
billion to almost $73.5 billion in annual discre-
16
tionary appropriations administering around 100 
17
programs. Meanwhile, education performance for 17- 
18
year-olds has stagnated since 1971. 
19
(6) The Department of Education has fostered 
20
over-regulation, standardization, bureaucratization, 
21
and litigation in United States education. 
22
(7) The Department of Education expends 
23
large amounts of money on its own maintenance and 
24
overhead. While the average national salary for pub-
25
04:54 May 19, 2021

3 
•HR 2106 IH
lic school teachers is $61,730 the average salary for 
1
a Department of Education employee is $112,724. 
2
(8) In certain States, the average State salary 
3
for a public school teacher is less than the national 
4
average. In North Carolina, the average salary for a 
5
public school teacher is $53,975. 
6
(9) Recent tests reflect poor results in mathe-
7
matics, science, and reading for American students 
8
compared with students from other nations. 
9
(10) Only through initiatives led by parents and 
10
local communities with the power to act can the 
11
United States elevate educational performance to-
12
ward an acceptable level. 
13
(11) The current system of top-down education 
14
uniformity is detrimental to local businesses and 
15
communities, the economic needs of the States, and 
16
the Nation’s ability to compete globally for jobs. 
17
(12) The Department of Education has been 
18
hostile to many promising reforms, including re-
19
forms that would empower parents, teachers, and 
20
local communities. The United States, once a labora-
21
tory of innovation through the experiments of the 
22
States, is moving toward education standardization 
23
that does not consider the individual educational 
24
needs of our diverse population of students.
