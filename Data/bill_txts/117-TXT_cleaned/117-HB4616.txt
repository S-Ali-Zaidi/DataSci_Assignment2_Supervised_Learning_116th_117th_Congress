(a) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds that—

•HR 4616 IH
(1) LIBOR is used as a benchmark rate in 
1
more than $200 trillion of contracts worldwide; 
2
(2) a significant number of existing contracts 
3
that reference LIBOR do not provide for the use of 
4
a clearly defined or practicable replacement bench-
5
mark rate when LIBOR is discontinued; and 
6
(3) the cessation or non-representativeness of 
7
LIBOR could result in disruptive litigation related 
8
to existing contracts that do not provide for the use 
9
of a clearly defined or practicable replacement 
10
benchmark rate. 
11
(b) PURPOSE.—It is the purpose— 
12
(1) of this Act— 
13
(A) to establish a clear and uniform proc-
14
ess, on a nationwide basis, for replacing LIBOR 
15
in existing contracts the terms of which do not 
16
provide for the use of a clearly defined or prac-
17
ticable replacement benchmark rate, without af-
18
fecting the ability of parties to use any appro-
19
priate benchmark rate in new contracts; 
20
(B) to preclude litigation related to exist-
21
ing contracts the terms of which do not provide 
22
for the use of a clearly defined or practicable 
23
replacement benchmark rate; and 
24
00:44 Jul 27, 2021
H4616

•HR 4616 IH
(C) to allow existing contracts that ref-
1
erence LIBOR but provide for the use of a 
2
clearly defined fallback and practicable replace-
3
ment rate, to operate according to their terms; 
4
and 
5
ø(2) of section 6 to provide that modifications 
6
of existing contracts pursuant to this chapter do not 
7
result in recognition of gain or loss for Federal in-
8
come tax purposes and to provide authority to the 
9
Secretary of the Treasury to provide clear guidance 
10
regarding the Federal income tax consequences of 
11
transitioning contracts that reference IBORs to re-
12
placement benchmark rates.¿
