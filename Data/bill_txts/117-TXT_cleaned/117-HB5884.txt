A BILL 
To direct the Attorney General to convene a national working 
group to study proactive strategies and needed resources 
for the identification and rescue of children from sexual 
exploitation and abuse, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘National Response to 
4
Exploitation and Sexual abuse of Children in Unaddressed 
5
Emergencies Act’’ or the ‘‘Child RESCUE Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The growing international trade in child 
3
sexual abuse material creates demand and incentive 
4
for the sexual assault of children throughout the 
5
United States. 
6
(2) United States law enforcement efforts to 
7
combat child sexual exploitation have the potential 
8
to help multiple distinct groups of victims, includ-
9
ing— 
10
(A) children depicted in child sexual abuse 
11
material (CSAM) who are still being assaulted; 
12
(B) children and adults whose victimiza-
13
tion as a child continues to be viewed and 
14
shared online; and 
15
(C) children who are being sexually as-
16
saulted by adults who could be interdicted while 
17
accessing or sharing CSAM online. 
18
(3) In congressional hearings held by the Com-
19
mittee on Energy and Commerce of the House of 
20
Representatives in 2006, the Department of Justice, 
21
the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and State law 
22
enforcement leaders estimated that hundreds of 
23
thousands of adults in the United States are engag-
24
ing in CSAM crimes.

•HR 5884 IH
(4) A growing body of research—including aca-
1
demic studies, analysis by the United States Sen-
2
tencing Commission, and findings by law enforce-
3
ment polygraphers—indicates that a majority of in-
4
dividuals possessing and sharing CSAM are ‘‘dual 
5
offenders’’ who possess illegal imagery and also com-
6
mit contact offenses. 
7
(5) According to a 2018 study by the National 
8
Center 
for 
Missing 
and 
Exploited 
Children 
9
(NCMEC), ‘‘in cases involving a single victim and 
10
single offender, actively traded cases were associated 
11
with having prepubescent victims. Actively traded 
12
cases were also associated with more egregious con-
13
tent in terms of sexual activity, and more likely to 
14
involve familial offenders, particularly nuclear family 
15
members.’’. 
16
(6) 
Law 
enforcement 
investigations 
of 
17
CyberTipline reports from the NCMEC frequently 
18
lead to the rescue of current child victims, thus ena-
19
bling law enforcement to interdict offenders who are 
20
abusing children by circulating CSAM and also com-
21
mitting contact offenses. In 2020, 21,700,000 
22
CyberTipline reports were submitted to NCMEC and 
23
approximately 200,000 CyberTipline reports were 
24
16:18 Nov 12, 2021
H5884
4 
•HR 5884 IH
made available to the 61 Internet Crimes Against 
1
Children (ICAC) units across the country. 
2
(7) United States law enforcement’s ability to 
3
detect and interdict online traffic in CSAM provides 
4
a historic opportunity to locate sexual predators and 
5
rescue children through victim-centric investigations. 
6
In 2020, the Internet Crimes Against Children Child 
7
Online Protection Services (ICACCOPS) and other 
8
law enforcement investigative systems detected more 
9
than 325,000 unique IP addresses in the U.S. that 
10
were associated with CSAM and made available to 
11
the Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) Task 
12
Forces. 
13
(8) With inadequate resources, United States 
14
law enforcement agencies are increasingly unable to 
15
adequately respond to this rapidly growing number 
16
of CyberTips and other investigative leads, a prob-
17
lem which also reduces the number of proactive un-
18
dercover investigations and education activities they 
19
can conduct. 
20
(9) Investigations of these crimes are com-
21
plicated by the increasing prevalence of encryption 
22
and anonymizing services available to offenders.
