•HR 9064 IH
(1) Jamal Khashoggi was a resident of the 
1
United States living in the Commonwealth of Vir-
2
ginia, a Saudi journalist, a Washington Post col-
3
umnist, and critical of the Saudi regime. 
4
(2) On October 2, 2018, Khashoggi was lured 
5
to the Consulate of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 
6
Istanbul, Turkey under the false cover of needing to 
7
address a consular matter. 
8
(3) While inside the Saudi consulate, Khashoggi 
9
was murdered, and his body was dismembered by in-
10
telligence officers of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. 
11
(4) The Office of the Director of National Intel-
12
ligence determined in 2018 that Saudi Crown Prince 
13
Mohammed Bin Salman approved the capture or 
14
killing of Khashoggi in Istanbul. 
15
(5) A highly credible inquiry by the United Na-
16
tions concluded that Khashoggi’s killing was pre-
17
meditated and that the mission was endorsed, 
18
planned, and overseen by senior Saudi officials.
