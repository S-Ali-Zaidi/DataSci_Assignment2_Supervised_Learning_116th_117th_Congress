SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) United States agriculture and supply chains 
3
are critical to United States economic success and 
4
prosperity, and should each be classified as critical 
5
infrastructure and critical technologies. 
6
(2) Agriculture is the lifeblood that helps to 
7
feed United States families nationwide. As such, 
8
food security is a matter of national security and 
9
should be a top priority of the United States. 
10
(3) To prevent harm to the United States pub-
11
lic health sector and to prevent disruption to the 
12
United States economy and food supply chains, the 
13
increasing influence foreign countries may have on 
14
the United States agriculture industry and agri-
15
culture supply chains should be mitigated.
