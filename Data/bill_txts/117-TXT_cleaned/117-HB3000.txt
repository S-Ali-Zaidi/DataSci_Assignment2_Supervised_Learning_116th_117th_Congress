SEC. 106. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE IMPOR-
7
TANCE OF TEACHERS IN INSPIRING CIVIC EN-
8
GAGEMENT. 
9
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
10
(1) Parents have a critical voice in ensuring 
11
their children receive an education that will help 
12
them to be engaged and productive members of 
13
American society, and members of the teaching pro-
14
fession are crucial to helping them achieve that goal. 
15
(2) The United States suffers from a lack of 
16
consistently effective civic education that imparts 
17
knowledge about government, democratic engage-
18
ment, and the Constitution. 
19
(3) Recent polling by the Annenberg Public 
20
Policy Center revealed that 22 percent of American 
21
adults are unable to name any of the three branches 
22
of government and 37 percent are unable to name 
23
or do not know any of the rights guaranteed by the 
24
First Amendment to the Constitution.

(4) Every State, the District of Columbia, the 
1
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and any other terri-
2
tory or possession of the United States reported a 
3
lack of qualified teachers in at least one academic 
4
subject during the 2017–2018 school year. 
5
(5) The Learning Policy Institute reported a 
6
teacher shortage of about 64,000 teachers during 
7
the 2015–2016 academic year and estimated that, 
8
beginning in 2020, 300,000 new teachers will be 
9
needed each year. 
10
(6) Teachers often do not receive full support 
11
for classroom activities or for advancing their con-
12
tributions to the education system through career 
13
development. 
14
(7) A survey by the Department of Education 
15
found that 94 percent of public school teachers in 
16
the United States paid for their own classroom sup-
17
plies and materials without reimbursement during 
18
the 2014–2015 school year, with the average teacher 
19
spending $479 out-of-pocket. 
20
(8) Eighteen percent of teachers work a second 
21
job during the school year, making teachers three 
22
times as likely as all workers in the United States 
23
to work multiple jobs.

els play a crucial role in educating youth about serv-

(10) The advancement of civic education and

the availability of well-trained and effective teachers

are essential for the future health of civil society in

the United States.

(1) teachers of all subjects and at all grade lev-
11
els, 
including 
those 
in 
public, 
private, 
and 
12
homeschool settings, are essential in inspiring civic 
13
knowledge and engagement in their students; 
14
(2) public school teachers are dedicated public 
15
servants and should be honored and supported in 
16
their work to educate youth in the United States; 
17
(3) teachers are crucial in inspiring their stu-
18
dents to contribute to their Nation and communities 
19
through all forms of service; 
20
(4) the profession of teaching is a noble endeav-
21
or and one that is vital to the civic education of 
22
American youth; 
23
(5) teachers across the country have sought to 
24
raise awareness of a crisis in resource support and

2
(6) officials at all levels of government should 
3
seek to address these concerns by providing teachers 
4
with resource support, adequate compensation, and 
5
career development opportunities; and 
6
(7) more Americans will be called to the teach-
7
ing profession when government officials at all levels 
8
demonstrate value for the essential role of teachers 
9
in our society by providing teachers with resource 
10
support, adequate compensation, and career develop-

(1) The implementation of Federal laws and the 
14
competent administration of Federal programs re-
15
quire skilled and capable personnel. 
16
(2) Executive agencies depend on a blended 
17
workforce that includes Federal employees, employ-
18
ees of prime contractors and subcontractors per-
19
forming services to Executive agencies, and employ-
20
ees of State or local governments, nonprofit organi-
21

23
terms of grants and cooperative agreements (in this

essential contributions to achieving the missions of 
1
the Government in service to the American people. 
2
(3) Approximately 2,000,000 Federal employees 
3
help to execute the laws of the United States, sup-
4
plemented by an unknown number, estimated to ex-
5
ceed 5,000,000, of employees of prime contractors, 
6
subcontractors, and grantees providing services to 
7
Executive agencies. 
8
(4) Policymakers, Executive agencies, and ob-
9
servers have often focused on individual components 
10
of the blended workforce, such as employees, without 
11
considering all components or considering the entire 
12
blended workforce and how all 3 components can 
13
work most effectively together. 
14
(5) Executive agencies inhibit their own work-
15
force planning and risk making decisions that may 
16
reduce the overall efficiency and cost effectiveness of 
17
the blended workforce by focusing on only 1 compo-
18
nent in isolation.

(6) Establishing artificial limits on headcounts 
20
or full-time equivalent positions for Federal employ-
21
ees, administrators, and managerial employees of 
22
Executive agencies may discourage the employment 
23
of interns or entry-level employees to build a bal-

encourage managers to shift work to contractors and

2
merical limits, even if those decisions are not justi-
3
fied by an approach to improve the efficiency or cost 
4
effectiveness of the Executive agency’s work.

(7) The Government Accountability Office has 
6
identified strategic human capital management as a

that critical skills gaps ‘‘impede the government
