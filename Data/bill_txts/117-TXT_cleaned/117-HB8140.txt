SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Historically Black colleges and universities 
3
hold a unique position in the efforts of the United 
4
States to diversify the science, technology, engineer-
5
ing, and mathematics academic and workforce com-
6
munities. 
7
(2) Although our Nation’s historically Black 
8
colleges and universities make up just 3 percent of 
9
the colleges and universities in the United States, 
10
historically Black colleges and universities graduate 
11
25 percent of African-American students with bacca-
12
laureate degrees in the fields of science, technology, 
13
engineering, and mathematics. 
14
(3) Historically Black colleges and universities 
15
are the institution of origin for almost 30 percent of 
16
Black graduates of science and engineering doc-
17
torate programs. 
18
(4) The health of the Department of Defense 
19
and the United States research ecosystem relies on 
20
high quality researchers from a diverse talent pool. 
21
(5) Historically Black colleges and universities 
22
have a history of conducting high quality research in 
23
unique areas, both providing impactful research out-
24
comes and developing the next generation of the re-
25
search ecosystem, including by—

unique areas that has enriched the Department 
2
of Defense research enterprise and the United 
3
States research ecosystem, including—

(i) providing science and engineering

faculty research opportunities at U.S. 
6
Navy Laboratories;

(ii) a ‘‘Young Investigators Program’’ 
8

10

11

12
(iii) Centers of Excellence in bio-
13
technology and materials science; and 
14
(B) strengthening and diversifying the 
15
United States research ecosystem by increasing 
16
the number of students who are students of di-
17
verse backgrounds from historically Black col-
18
leges and universities with undergraduate or 
19
graduate degrees in science, technology, engi-
20
neering, or mathematics; and 
21
(C) fueling domestic and international col-
22
laborations that led to trailblazing discoveries

and innovative technologies.

(6) In 2019, historically Black colleges and uni-
1
versities received $371,000,000, or about 0.8 percent 
2
of the $44,500,000,000 in Federal funding to insti-
3
tutions of higher education for research and develop-
4
ment. The amount of funding for 2019 is a marked 
5
decrease from fiscal year 2018, when historically 
6
Black 
colleges 
and 
universities 
received 
7
$400,000,000 in Federal research and development 
8
funding (0.9 percent of the Federal funding to insti-
9
tutions of higher education for such purposes). 
10
(7) There are no historically Black colleges and 
11
universities designated as very high research activity 
12
status, as classified by the Carnegie Classification of 
13
Institutions of Higher Education. 
14
(8) Meaningfully investing in the research ca-
15
pacity of historically Black colleges and universities 
16
is an investment in our Nation’s future and will help 
17
meet accelerating science, technology, engineering, 
18
and mathematics workforce demands and safeguard 
19
the national security interests of the United States.

SEC. 3. PURPOSE.
