SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Working for Immi-
2

3
‘‘WISE Act of 2022’’.

SEC. 2. PURPOSE; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
5
(a) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act is to remove 
6
barriers to immigration status for non-citizen survivors of 
7
domestic violence, sexual assault, human trafficking, and 
8
other crimes who may be eligible for protections under the 
9
Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (VAWA) and the 
10
Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (TVPA) and 
11
other vulnerable immigrants. 
12
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
13
gress that the Secretary of Homeland Security should re-
14
duce barriers to, and provide victims timely access to the 
15
immigration protections such as those created in VAWA 
16
and the TVPA, as well as refrain from deporting crime 
17
victims before their applications for humanitarian relief 
18
are fully adjudicated, as it undermines critical bi-partisan 
19
protections created in VAWA and the TVPA.
