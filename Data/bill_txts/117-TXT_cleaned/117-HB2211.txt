SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) A January 2021 survey by the Bank for 
8
International Settlements found that 86 percent of 
9
central banks, representing countries with close to 
10

•HR 2211 IH
72 percent of the world’s population and 91 percent 
1
of global economic output, are currently or will soon 
2
be engaged in work relating to CBDC, with almost 
3
three-quarters of such central banks having moved 
4
beyond the research of CBDC to experimentation, 
5
proof of concept, or testing activities. 
6
(2) Since December 2016, the European Cen-
7
tral Bank and the Bank of Japan have conducted a 
8
joint research project named ‘‘Project Stella’’, which 
9
aims to conduct experimental work and conceptual 
10
studies exploring the opportunities of digital ledger 
11
technologies and challenges for the future of finan-
12
cial market infrastructures, including CBDCs. 
13
(3) Since 2014, the People’s Bank of China has 
14
conducted research and development activities for a 
15
CBDC, and in October 2020, launched a digital 
16
yuan pilot program in Shenzhen. 
17
(4) In August 2020, the Federal Reserve Bank 
18
of Boston announced a collaboration with the Digital 
19
Currency Initiative at the Massachusetts Institute of 
20
Technology to perform technical research related to 
21
a central bank digital currency. 
22
(5) In October 2020, the Financial Stability 
23
Board, in coordination with the BIS’s Committee on 
24
Payments and Market Infrastructures, released a re-

port to provide a roadmap for enhancing cross-bor-
1
der payments, including an exploration of new pay-
2
ment infrastructures presented by central bank dig-
3
ital currencies. 
4
(6) In January 2020, the Bank for Inter-
5
national Settlements announced that the Bank of 
6
England, the Bank of Canada, the Bank of Japan, 
7
the European Central Bank, the Sveriges Riksbank, 
8
the Swiss National Bank, and the Bank of Inter-
9
national Settlements had formed a group to share 
10
information on the potential uses of CBDC in the 
11
central banks’ jurisdictions, as well as information 
12
on potential economic, functional, and technical de-
13
sign choices. 
14
(7) According to data from the International 
15
Monetary Fund, as of the third quarter of 2019, the 
16
United States dollar share of global currency re-
17
serves totaled $6,750,000,000,000, or 61.78 percent 
18
of all allocated reserves, and the standing of the 
19
United States dollar as the world’s predominant re-
20
serve currency enables the United States to use eco-
21
nomic sanctions as a foreign policy tool. 
22
(8) According to a 2018 report by the Board of 
23
Governors of the Federal Reserve System, cash con-
24
tinues to be the most frequently used payment in-

strument, representing 30 percent of all transactions 
1
and 55 percent of transactions under $10, with 77 
2
percent of those transactions made in-person.

(9) The Federal Reserve System is responsible 
4
for, among other things, conducting United States 
5
monetary policy, promoting the stability of the fi-
6
nancial system, supervising financial institutions to 
7
ensure safety and soundness, ensuring the safety 
8
and efficiency of payment systems, and issuing and 
9
circulating Federal Reserve notes. 
10
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
11
It is the sense of Congress that— 
12
(1) the Board of Governors should continue to 
13
conduct research on, design, and develop, a CBDC 
14
that takes into account its impact on consumers, 
15
businesses, the United States financial system, and 
16
the United States economy, including the potential 
17
impact of a CBDC on monetary policy; and 
18
(2) the United States should strive to maintain 
19
its leadership in financial technology and ensure that 
20
the U.S. dollar remains the predominant reserve cur-
21
rency in the world economy.
