RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives regard-
ing the need for State legislatures to pass comprehensive 
sexual assault kit reforms. 
Whereas survivors of sexual assault may undergo an hours- 
long sexual assault forensic exam to preserve DNA evi-
dence; 
Whereas many sexual assault kits across the country remain 
untested; 
Whereas untested sexual assault kits represent individuals 
who have been denied the opportunity to seek justice and 
begin healing; 
Whereas testing sexual assault kits may help law enforcement 
officials identify repeat offenders and serial rapists;

Whereas the testing of 11,341 sexual assault kits in Detroit 
has resulted in 2,616 DNA matches, the identification of 
more than 841 suspected serial rapists, and 239 convic-
tions, and the DNA samples from the kits tested in De-
troit are linked to other violent crimes committed in 40 
States and the District of Columbia; 
Whereas ending the sexual assault kit backlog requires the 
commitment of Federal, State, and local governments 
and their partners; and 
Whereas, in 2021, the Begun Center for Violence Prevention 
Research and Education at Case Western Reserve Uni-
versity and the Criminology Research Center at Cleveland 
State University, in partnership with the Sexual Assault 
Kit Task Force at Cuyahoga County Prosecutor’s Office, 
analyzed the cost of testing backlogged sexual assault 
kits in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, and found that each kit 
tested produces an estimated net savings to the commu-
nity of $5,127, producing a total cost savings of 
$26,480,000: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-
1
resentatives that State legislatures should pass sexual as-
2
sault kit reform legislation that requires— 
3
(1) the State to establish collaborations with 
4
State and local sexual assault advocates, sexual as-
5
sault nurse examiners, law enforcement officers, and 
6
others to ensure that— 
7
(A) a sexual assault advocate is made 
8
available to sexual assault survivors upon a re-
9
port to law enforcement, during a sexual as-

sault forensic exam, and for ongoing support 
1
and services; 
2
(B) sexual assault survivors are notified of 
3
their rights and kit results in a trauma-in-
4
formed manner, in collaboration with sexual as-
5
sault advocates; and 
6
(C) policies and procedures pertaining to 
7
sexual assault kit examinations, testing, and no-
8
tification are victim-centered and developed col-
9
laboratively across victim advocacy, medical, 
10
law enforcement, and other sexual assault re-
11
sponse team partners; 
12
(2) the State to conduct an annual statewide 
13
audit to inventory all untested sexual assault evi-
14
dence kits with the goal of understanding the scope 
15
of the problem and to monitor progress in elimi-
16
nating the backlog of previously unsubmitted and 
17
untested kits; 
18
(3) law enforcement agencies to submit all pre-
19
viously untested sexual assault kits to a laboratory 
20
and mandates that the laboratory test these kits for 
21
DNA within a specific timeframe and upload the re-
22
sults into appropriate State and Federal databases; 
23
(4) law enforcement agencies to promptly sub-
24
mit all newly collected kits that have been released

for testing to the laboratory and mandates that the 
1
laboratory test these kits for DNA within a specific 
2
timeframe and upload the results into appropriate 
3
State and Federal databases; 
4
(5) the State to develop a sexual assault kit 
5
tracking system that includes a mechanism for sur-
6
vivors to check the status of their kits through the 
7
process, from collection to analysis, and ensure that 
8
hospitals, law enforcement, and laboratories are 
9
using the same system to track sexual assault kits; 
10
(6) the State ensure that victims have the legal 
11
right to know the status and location of their sexual 
12
assault kits and their case; and 
13
(7) the State to contribute appropriate and sus-
14
tainable funding to address issues related to the 
15
unsubmitted and untested sexual assault kit backlog, 
16
including trauma-informed support services for sur-
17
vivors.
