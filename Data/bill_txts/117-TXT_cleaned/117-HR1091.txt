RESOLUTION 
Calling for the immediate resignation of Alejandro Nicholas 
Mayorkas, Secretary of Homeland Security. 
Whereas the Biden administration willfully neglected the cri-
sis at the United States southern border and remains in-
different to the security of Americans; 
Whereas the Biden administration’s open-border policies are 
fueling drug-related deaths across the United States, and 
between October 2020 and September 2021, nearly 
80,000 Americans died of an opioid drug-related over-
dose; 
Whereas synthetic opioids such as fentanyl are primarily 
smuggled through our southwest land border and ports of 
entry by cartels and dangerous criminals;

Whereas Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Nicholas 
Mayorkas testified there were 389,155 migrants who 
were not apprehended and got past border agents during 
fiscal year 2021, further jeopardizing our national secu-
rity; 
Whereas the Biden administration’s refusal to enforce Fed-
eral laws, including deporting criminals and maintaining 
order at the border, has put the United States on the 
verge of a national security crisis; 
Whereas U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) appre-
hended at least 23 people coming across the southern 
border whose names are on the terror watch list; 
Whereas Biden administration officials refused to confirm 
whether suspected terrorists, and individuals from adver-
sarial nations such as Russia and China, have been re-
leased into our communities; 
Whereas the Biden administration’s harmful rhetoric encour-
ages unaccompanied minors to travel to the United 
States, driving families to place their children in the 
hands of smugglers and human traffickers; 
Whereas the Biden administration allows criminal organiza-
tions to use the United States-Mexico border as a pipe-
line to bring people to the United States and subject 
them to human rights abuses; 
Whereas the Biden administration claims they have ‘‘effec-
tively managed’’ the historic border crisis despite pri-
vately telling Border Patrol agents in August that the sit-
uation was ‘‘unsustainable’’; 
Whereas the Biden administration continually blames the 
prior administration for the issues being faced at the bor-
der today despite dismantling successful policies;

•HRES 1091 IH 
Whereas the Biden administration plans to rescind title 42, 
United States Code, which enables the Department of 
Homeland Security (DHS) to immediately expel individ-
uals who attempt to cross our southern border illegally; 
Whereas the Department of Homeland Security estimates 
that up to 18,000 migrants could be apprehended at the 
border each day if title 42 is rescinded; 
Whereas the Biden administration’s expedited and repeated 
rejection of the successful Migrant Protection Protocols 
(MPP) (the ‘‘Remain in Mexico’’ policy) shows a willing-
ness to embrace an open-borders agenda that undermines 
United States safety; 
Whereas the Biden administration has refused to administer 
the Remain in Mexico program in good faith as required 
by a Federal court order; 
Whereas the Biden administration has rescinded safe third 
country agreements with Central American partners that 
gave asylum-seekers the chance to apply for asylum in 
the first safe country which they entered; 
Whereas the Biden administration has wasted taxpayer dol-
lars by halting construction of physical barriers along the 
southern border authorized and appropriated by law; 
Whereas more illegal aliens have crossed the border in 15 
months under the Biden administration than in 4 years 
under the previous administration; 
Whereas the Biden administration has discussed plans to re-
assign Border Patrol agents and Federal employees, in-
cluding individuals from the Department of Veterans Af-
fairs, from their official duties to take care of the explod-
ing number of unaccompanied minors in Federal custody,

potenially taking resources away both from those secur-
ing the border and our Nation’s heroes; 
Whereas the Biden administration has willfully ignored laws 
passed by Congress requiring the Secretary of Homeland 
Security to take all actions ‘‘necessary and appropriate to 
achieve and maintain operational control over the entire 
international land and maritime borders of the United 
States’’ as required by Public Law 109–367, the Secure 
Fence Act of 2006; 
Whereas the Department of Homeland Security’s proposed 
‘‘Disinformation Governance Board’’ creates serious eth-
ical concerns that could suppress free speech while fur-
ther undermining the United States people’s confidence 
in the Department; and 
Whereas the actions laid out above constitute a severe derelic-
tion of duty and a constitutional failure to fulfill the 
oaths of office taken by Alejandro Nicholas Mayorkas: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-
1
resentatives that Secretary of Homeland Security

Alejandro Nicholas Mayorkas immediately resign from of-
