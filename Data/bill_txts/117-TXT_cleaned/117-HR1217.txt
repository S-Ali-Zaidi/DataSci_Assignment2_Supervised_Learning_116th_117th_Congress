RESOLUTION 
Addressing the national crisis of suicide among minority 
adolescents. 
Whereas suicide is a mental health issue that affects individ-
uals and families around the Nation regardless of race, 
religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, nation of 
birth, economic background, disability, or age; 
Whereas the World Health Organization defines ‘‘adoles-
cents’’ as children between the ages of 10 to 19; 
Whereas, over the last two decades, self-reported suicide at-
tempts rose nearly 80 percent among Black adolescents, 
by far the biggest increase of all races and ethnicities;

Whereas Black children under 13 are dying by suicide at 
nearly twice the rate of White children the same age; 
Whereas the COVID–19 public health emergency has dis-
proportionately affected the mental health of Black and 
Indigenous people of color (BIPOC) youth due to— 
(1) Black and Latinx adolescents seeing more 
COVID–19 related infection and death in their commu-
nities than their White counterparts; and 
(2) Black and Latinx families suffering from dis-
proportionate economic setback which leads to financial 
stress and instability; 
Whereas the suicide rate for adolescent Native and Indige-
nous females is five times higher than for their White 
counterparts; 
Whereas the American Indian and Alaska Native youth sui-
cide rate is 2.5 times that of the overall national average; 
Whereas suicide is the leading cause of death for Asian 
American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) youth aged 12 to 
19 years old; 
Whereas 19.7 percent of AAPI students in grades 9–12 seri-
ously considered attempting suicide in the year before the 
survey was taken; 
Whereas youth of color were witness to the renewed national 
attention and protests against racialized police violence 
when an unarmed Black man named George Floyd was 
killed during the summer of 2020; 
Whereas racism against the AAPI community has been exac-
erbated due to xenophobic, harmful rhetoric to describe 
the origins of the coronavirus pandemic;

•HRES 1217 IH 
Whereas repeated experiences of racialized violence and prej-
udice may lead to racial trauma which can manifest as 
depression and anxiety; 
Whereas racial inequities in mental health are a result of his-
torical oppression and discriminatory practices that have 
deliberately and unjustly targeted marginalized commu-
nities; 
Whereas BIPOC adolescents are significantly less likely than 
White youth to receive treatment for their depression 
overall because of negative perceptions of services and 
health care providers; 
Whereas structural racism has resulted in limited access to 
health care for BIPOC adolescents; 
Whereas the lack of cultural understanding and competency 
by health care providers can cause individuals to delay or 
forgo care and may contribute to underdiagnosis of men-
tal illness in people from racially and ethnically diverse 
populations; and 
Whereas the lack of school resource funding results in a lack 
of school-based mental health services, especially in 
schools whose populations are predominately made up of 
students of color: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-
1
resentatives that— 
2
(1) adolescents experiencing mental health con-
3
cerns, including depression, anxiety and, among 
4
some groups, increased risk for suicide, should have 
5
readily available resources to effectively understand 
6
and ensure their needs are addressed;

(2) no adolescent or student, regardless of their 
1
race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, nation of 
2
birth, economic background, disability, or age should 
3
face mental health issues alone; 
4
(3) socioeconomic disparities, stigma, and 
5
unequitable access to health care resources are all 
6
barriers that prevent youth from receiving the help 
7
they need; 
8
(4) public officials should utilize their respective 
9
platforms to increase awareness and culturally com-
10
petent resources in support of social, emotional, and 
11
mental health needs of adolescents, especially in sup-
12
port of students of color and groups more suscep-
13
tible to risk; 
14
(5) ensuring that students of color have school- 
15
based mental health services is an essential part in 
16
mitigating increased suicide rates; and 
17
(6) Congress should commit to adequately fund 
18
existing programs and organizations that are work-
19
ing to close the racial and socioeconomic disparities 
20
in mental health.
