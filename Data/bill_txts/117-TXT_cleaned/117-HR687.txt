RESOLUTION 
Supporting the designation of September 2021 as ‘‘National 
Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month’’. 
Whereas ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer 
deaths of women in the United States and causes more 
deaths than any other gynecologic cancer; 
Whereas, in the United States, a woman’s lifetime risk of 
being diagnosed with ovarian cancer is about 1 in 78; 
Whereas the American Cancer Society estimates 21,750 cases 
of ovarian cancer were newly diagnosed in 2020 and 
13,940 individuals died from the disease nationwide; 
Whereas the five-year survival rate for ovarian cancer is 46.5 
percent and survival rates vary greatly depending on the 
stage of diagnosis;

Whereas the five-year survival rate for ovarian cancer is over 
90 percent for individuals diagnosed in early stages; 
Whereas, while the mammogram can detect breast cancer and 
the Pap smear can detect cervical cancer, there is no reli-
able early detection test for ovarian cancer; 
Whereas, in June 2007, the first national consensus state-
ment on ovarian cancer symptoms was developed to pro-
vide consistency in describing symptoms to make it easier 
for women to learn and remember those symptoms; 
Whereas Black women with ovarian cancer are more likely to 
have late-stage diagnoses, receive lower quality clinical 
services, and have lower 5-year survival rates than non- 
Black women; 
Whereas Black women have a 5-year ovarian cancer mortality 
rate of 62 percent, while the 5-year ovarian cancer mor-
tality rate is 54 percent for White women; 
Whereas women of color, low-income women, and women liv-
ing in rural areas have more barriers to accessing a 
standard quality of care and are more likely to receive 
care at a facility that has poorer adherence to National 
Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) treatment 
guidelines; 
Whereas the proportion of ovarian cancer cases in women 
serving on active duty who are less than 45 years of age 
is substantially greater than in the general population; 
Whereas too many people remain unaware that the symptoms 
of ovarian cancer often include bloating, pelvic or abdom-
inal pain, difficulty eating or feeling full quickly, urinary 
symptoms, and several other vague symptoms that are 
often easily confused with other diseases;

•HRES 687 IH 
Whereas improved awareness of the symptoms of ovarian 
cancer by the pubic and health care providers can lead 
to quicker diagnoses and improved outcomes; 
Whereas the lack of an early detection test for ovarian cancer 
combined with its vague symptoms mean that approxi-
mately 80 percent of cases of ovarian cancer are detected 
at an advanced stage; 
Whereas issues collecting and reporting data on treatment 
and outcomes related to ovarian cancer risk, especially 
for underserved communities and marginalized popu-
lations, can impede the development of effective policy; 
Whereas all women are at risk for ovarian cancer, but ap-
proximately 20 percent of women who are diagnosed with 
ovarian cancer have a hereditary predisposition to ovar-
ian cancer, which places them at even higher risk; 
Whereas scientists and physicians have uncovered changes in 
the BRCA genes that some women inherit from their 
parents, which may make those women 30 times more 
likely to develop ovarian cancer; 
Whereas the family history of a woman has been found to 
play an important role in accurately assessing her risk of 
developing ovarian cancer and medical experts believe 
that family history should be taken into consideration 
during the annual well-woman visit of any woman; 
Whereas women who know that they are at high risk of ovar-
ian cancer may undertake prophylactic measures to help 
reduce the risk of developing this disease; 
Whereas guidelines issued by the NCCN and the Society of 
Gynecologic Oncology recommend that all individuals di-
agnosed with ovarian cancer receive genetic counseling 
and genetic testing regardless of their family history;

•HRES 687 IH 
Whereas studies consistently show that compliance with these 
guidelines is alarmingly low, with recently published Na-
tional Cancer Institute-funded research finding that in 
2013 and 2014, only one-third of ovarian cancer sur-
vivors have undergone such testing; 
Whereas, according to a 2016 consensus report by the Na-
tional Academy of Medicine, ‘‘there remain surprising 
gaps in the fundamental knowledge about and under-
standing of ovarian cancer’’ across all aspects of the dis-
ease; 
Whereas ongoing investments in ovarian cancer research and 
education and awareness efforts are critical to closing 
these gaps and improving survivorship for women with 
ovarian cancer; 
Whereas each year during the month of September, the Ovar-
ian Cancer Research Alliance and community partner or-
ganizations hold a number of events to increase public 
awareness of ovarian cancer and its symptoms; and 
Whereas September 2021 should be designated as ‘‘National 
Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month’’ to increase public 
awareness of ovarian cancer: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the designation of ‘‘National Ovar-
2
ian Cancer Awareness Month’’; and 
3
(2) supports the goals and ideals of ‘‘National 
4
Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month’’.
