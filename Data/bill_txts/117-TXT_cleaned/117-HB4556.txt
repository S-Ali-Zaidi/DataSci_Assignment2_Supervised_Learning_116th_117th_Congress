A BILL 
To direct the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to 
find that certain rates for electricity are inherently un-
just and unreasonable, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

direction to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission

with respect to wholesale electricity rates.

SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
3
Congress makes the following findings: 
4
(1) When passing the Federal Power Act, Con-
5
gress required the Federal Energy Regulatory Com-
6
mission (‘‘the Commission’’) to ensure that the rates 
7
charged by electric utilities for, or in connection 
8
with, wholesale electricity rates are ‘‘just and rea-
9
sonable’’, a process which necessarily includes the 
10
evaluation of all factors affecting wholesale market 
11
rates, including environmental externalities. 
12
(2) The Federal Power Act requires the Com-
13
mission to ensure that public utilities do not grant 
14
undue preference or advantage to, or discriminate 
15
against, any person when making wholesale elec-
16
tricity sales. 
17
(3) Section 206(a) of the Federal Power Act 
18
authorizes the Commission to change any rates that 
19
the Commission determines to be ‘‘unjust, unreason-
20
able, unduly discriminatory or preferential’’. 
21
(4) In its final rule titled ‘‘Endangerment and 
22
Cause or Contribute Findings for Greenhouse Gases 
23
Under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act’’ pub-
24
lished on December 15, 2009 (74 Fed. Reg. 66496),

•HR 4556 IH
the Environmental Protection Agency found that the 
1
emissions of greenhouse gases ‘‘endanger both the 
2
public health and the public welfare of current and 
3
future generations’’. 
4
(5) The failure of markets to internalize the 
5
costs of greenhouse gas pollution into the cost of 
6
products, including electricity, led to a misallocation 
7
of capital, and therefore to the emission of a greater 
8
volume of these pollutants. 
9
(6) In 1956, the Supreme Court held in Federal 
10
Power Commission v. Sierra Pacific Power Com-
11
pany, 350 U.S. 348 (1956), that the Commission 
12
must ensure protection of the public interest when 
13
exercising its authority to set just and reasonable 
14
rates. 
15
(7) The restructuring of the electricity industry 
16
in the Federal Power Act was intended to promote 
17
competition among electricity providers, resulting in 
18
lower electricity rates to consumers, higher quality 
19
services, and a more robust national economy. 
20
(8) Prior to restructuring, utility commissions 
21
were frequently asked to consider other societal ben-
22
efits when setting rates, including access to energy, 
23
rate equity between different classes of customers, 
24
and environmental concerns.

(9) According to the Environmental Protection 
1
Agency, in 2019, emissions from the power sector 
2
contributed the second highest share of greenhouse 
3
gas emissions by economic sector. 
4
(10) The benefits of competition will not be 
5
achieved if some competitors enjoy an advantage re-
6
sulting from externalization of environmental costs, 
7
permitting them to charge prices for electricity that 
8
do not reflect the full economic and environmental 
9
cost of production. 
10
(11) Despite the Environmental Protection 
11
Agency’s finding of endangerment, emissions of 
12
greenhouse gases into the air, which endanger public 
13
health and threaten the quality of the air, land, and 
14
water of the United States, are externalities that are 
15
not frequently or uniformly reflected in the price 
16
charged for products such as electricity across the 
17
United States. 
18
(12) The disparity in regulatory treatment be-
19
tween electric generating units with above-average 
20
greenhouse gas emissions and those with little to no 
21
greenhouse gas emissions provides a significant com-
22
petitive advantage for high greenhouse gas emitting 
23
energy generating units over their competitors.

(13) States and State commissions should be 
1
encouraged to incorporate the cost of greenhouse gas 
2
emissions into wholesale rates for electricity.

SEC. 4. CERTAIN RATES UNJUST, UNREASONABLE, UNDULY 
4
DISCRIMINATORY, OR PREFERENTIAL. 
5
(a) IN GENERAL.—For the purposes of section 205 
6
and section 206 of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 
7
824d, 824e), if the Federal Energy Regulatory Commis-
8
sion determines that a rate for the wholesale sale of elec-
9
tricity does not incorporate the cost of externalized green-
10
house gas emissions to public health, safety, or welfare, 
11
then the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission shall 
12
find that such rate is unjust, unreasonable, unduly dis-
13
criminatory, or preferential. 
14
(b) GREENHOUSE
GAS
DEFINED.—In this sub-
15
section, the term ‘‘greenhouse gas’’ includes— 
16
(1) any gas identified by the Environmental 
17
Protection 
Agency 
in 
the 
final 
rule 
titled 
18
‘‘Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Findings 
19
for Greenhouse Gases Under Section 202(a) of the 
20
Clean Air Act’’ published on December 15, 2009 (74 
21
Fed. Reg. 66496), including carbon dioxide, hydro-
22
fluorocarbons, methane, nitrous oxide, perfluorocar-
23
bons, and sulfur hexafluoride; and 
24
(2) nitrogen trifluoride.
