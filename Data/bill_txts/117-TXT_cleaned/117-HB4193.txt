title 11, United States Code, including, with respect 
1
to the entity filing bankruptcy— 
2
(A) any district in which the place of in-
3
corporation of the entity is located; 
4
(B) any district in which the principal 
5
place of business or principal assets of the enti-
6
ty are located; and 
7
(C) any district in which an affiliate of the 
8
entity has filed a pending case under title 11, 
9
United States Code; 
10
(2) the wide range of permissible bankruptcy 
11
venue options has led to an increase in companies 
12
filing for bankruptcy outside of their home States— 
13
the district in which the principal place of business 
14
or principal assets of the company is located; 
15
(3) the practice described in paragraph (2) is 
16
known as ‘‘forum shopping’’; 
17
(4) forum shopping has resulted in a concentra-
18
tion of bankruptcy cases in a limited number of dis-
19
tricts; 
20
(5) forum shopping— 
21
(A) prevents small businesses, employees, 
22
retirees, creditors, and other important stake-
23
holders from fully participating in bankruptcy

cases that have tremendous impacts on their 
1
lives, communities, and local economies; and 
2
(B) deprives district courts of the United 
3
States of the opportunity to contribute to the 
4
development of bankruptcy law in the jurisdic-
5
tions of those district courts; and 
6
(6) reducing forum shopping in the bankruptcy 
7
system will strengthen the integrity of, and build 
8
public confidence and ensure fairness in, the bank-
9
ruptcy system. 
10
(b) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act is to prevent 
11
the practice of forum shopping in cases filed under chapter 
12
11 of title 11, United States Code.
