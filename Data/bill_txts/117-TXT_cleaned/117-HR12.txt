formal presidential transition to President-elect Biden to 
begin; 
Whereas all 50 states and the District of Columbia have cer-
tified their Presidential election results; 
Whereas in a public letter, all 10 living former Secretaries of 
Defense declared, ‘‘Our elections have occurred. Recounts 
and audits have been conducted. Appropriate challenges 
have been addressed by the courts. Governors have cer-

time for questioning the results has passed; the time for 
the formal counting of the electoral college votes, as pre-
scribed in the Constitution and statute, has arrived.’’; 
Whereas some Members of Congress plan to reject Presi-
dential electors from certain States on January 6, 2021, 
at a joint session of Congress to count electoral votes and 
declare election results over baseless allegations of voter 
fraud in the November 2020 Presidential Election; and 
Whereas these same members of Congress were also elected 
in the November 2020 election and were sworn in as 
Members of Congress on January 3, 2021: Now, there-
