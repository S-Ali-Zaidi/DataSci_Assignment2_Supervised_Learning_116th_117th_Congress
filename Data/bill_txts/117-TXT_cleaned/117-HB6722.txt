(3) On July 24, 1966, Lance Corporal Pitt-
1
man’s unit, First Platoon, Company I, Third Bat-
2
talion, Fifth Marines, was moving along a trail near 
3
the Demilitarized Zone in the Republic of Vietnam 
4
when the Marines ahead of them came under attack. 
5
(4) Upon hearing the attack, Lance Corporal 
6
Pittman took a machine gun and several belts of 
7
ammunition and rushed to aid his comrades. As he 
8
advanced, Lance Corporal Pittman encountered in-
9
tense small-arms fire at point-blank range. He was 
10
able to return fire and silence the enemy combat-
11
ants. Continuing towards the attacked Marines, 
12
Lance Corporal Pittman came under heavy fire from 
13
two automatic weapons, which he was able to de-
14
stroy. 
15
(5) When Lance Corporal Pittman learned 
16
there were additional wounded Marines further 
17
along the trail, he endured enemy mortar and gun-
18
fire to get to them. As he reached them, he faced 
19
an attack by 30 to 40 enemy fighters.

(6) Lance Corporal Pittman used a combination 
21
of machine-gun fire, an enemy submachine gun, a 
22
pistol from a fallen comrade, and a grenade to cause 
23
enemy forces to withdraw. Due to his courageous ac-
24
tions, many of his wounded comrades were saved.
