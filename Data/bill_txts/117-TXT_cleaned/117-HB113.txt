A BILL 
To provide for research and education with respect to triple- 
negative breast cancer, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Triple-Negative Breast 
4
Cancer Research and Education Act of 2021’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds as follows: 
7
(1) Breast cancer accounts for 1 in 4 cancer di-
8
agnoses among women in this country.

(2) The survival rate for breast cancer has in-
1
creased to 90 percent for White women and 78 per-
2
cent for African-American women. 
3
(3) African-American women are more likely to 
4
be diagnosed with larger tumors and more advanced 
5
stages of breast cancer despite a lower incidence 
6
rate. 
7
(4) Early detection for breast cancer increases 
8
survival rates for breast cancer, as evidenced by a 5- 
9
year relative survival rate of 98 percent for breast 
10
cancers that are discovered before the cancer 
11
spreads beyond the breast, compared to 23 percent 
12
for stage IV breast cancers. 
13
(5) Triple-negative breast cancer is a term used 
14
to describe breast cancers whose cells do not have 
15
estrogen receptors and progesterone receptors, and 
16
do not have an excess of the HER2 protein on their 
17
sources. 
18
(6) It is estimated that between 10 and 20 per-
19
cent of female breast cancer patients are diagnosed 
20
with triple-negative breast cancer, and studies indi-
21
cate the prevalence of triple-negative breast cancer is 
22
much higher.

(7) Triple-negative breast cancer most com-
1
monly affects African-American women, followed by 
2
Hispanic women. 
3
(8) Triple-negative breast cancer is a very ag-
4
gressive form of cancer which affects women under 
5
the age of 50 across all racial and socioeconomic 
6
backgrounds. 
7
(9) African-American women are 3 times more 
8
likely to develop triple-negative breast cancer than 
9
White women. 
10
(10) Triple-negative breast cancer tends to 
11
grow and spread more quickly than most other types 
12
of breast cancer. 
13
(11) Like other forms of breast cancer, triple- 
14
negative breast cancer is treated with surgery, radi-
15
ation therapy, or chemotherapy. 
16
(12) Early-stage detection of triple-negative 
17
breast cancer is the key to survival because the 
18
tumor cells lack certain receptors, and neither hor-
19
mone therapy nor drugs that target these receptors 
20
are effective against these cancers; therefore, early 
21
detection and education is vital. 
22
(13) Current research and available data do not 
23
provide adequate information on—
