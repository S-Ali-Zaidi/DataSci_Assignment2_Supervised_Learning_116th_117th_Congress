SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress find the following: 
2
(1) Domestic factory output has increased by 
3
21 percent since June 2009, but manufacturing em-
4
ployment has only increased 5 percent during that 
5
time, and has been flat since late 2014. 
6
(2) As manufacturers leverage new technologies 
7
from robotics to distributed control systems to create 
8
modern factories and industrial plants, different em-
9
ployment requirements have emerged including the 
10
need for cybersecurity talent. 
11
(3) Leading cybersecurity experts have reported 
12
spike of 250 percent in industrial automation and 
13
control system cyber-incidents occurring during the 
14
period between 2011 and 2015 and as a result are 
15
seeking personnel with knowledge of their industry 
16
coupled with knowledge of security technology to 
17
prevent their organization from becoming victims of 
18
cyber-attacks.
