Congress finds the following:

•HR 5675 IH
(1) Liver cancer is the fastest-growing cause of 
1
cancer death in the United States and among the 
2
leading causes of cancer deaths globally. 
3
(2) The Division of Cancer Control and Popu-
4
lation Sciences of the National Cancer Institute esti-
5
mated that there will be 42,230 new liver cancer di-
6
agnoses in the year 2021, and approximately 30,200 
7
will die from the disease. 
8
(3) Liver cancer is a leading cause of cancer 
9
death among the Asian American and Pacific Is-
10
lander community. 
11
(4) The most vulnerable Asian Americans are 
12
those who are foreign-born, low-income, and living in 
13
ethnic enclaves. 
14
(5) Asian and Pacific Islander men and women 
15
are more than twice as likely to develop liver cancer 
16
compared to the non-Hispanic White population. 
17
(6) Among the Asian and Pacific Islander pop-
18
ulation, the higher incidence rate of liver cancer is 
19
partially explained by higher incidence rates of hepa-
20
titis B and diabetes, which are comorbidities shown 
21
to increase an individual’s risk of developing liver 
22
cancer.

•HR 5675 IH
(7) The most common causes of liver cancer in-
1
clude hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus infec-
2
tion. 
3
(8) Hepatitis B is a primary risk factor for de-
4
veloping liver cancer, and 1 in 4 of those chronically 
5
infected with hepatitis B develop cirrhosis, liver fail-
6
ure, or liver cancer. 
7
(9) Half of all individuals with hepatitis B in 
8
the United States are Asian American or Pacific Is-
9
lander, though this group accounts for only 5 per-
10
cent of the population of the United States. 
11
(10) Among African immigrants in the United 
12
States, the prevalence of hepatitis B infection is ap-
13
proximately 1 in 10, and African immigrants make 
14
up 30 percent of those with chronic hepatitis B in-
15
fection in the United States. 
16
(11) Among Hispanic/Latino communities, liver 
17
cancer incidence and death rates are twice as high 
18
compared to the non-Hispanic White population. 
19
(12) Hispanics/Latinos are 60 percent more 
20
likely to die from viral hepatitis than non-Hispanic 
21
Whites.
