MENTS. 
2
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following find-
3
ings: 
4
(1) The most recent distribution made from the 
5
Provider Relief Fund to eligible health care pro-
6
viders began in 2020. 
7
(2) No distributions from the Provider Relief 
8
Fund have been made or announced to account for 
9
the surge in COVID–19 cases caused by the Delta 
10
variant. 
11
(3) That surge, at its peak, saw 7-day averages 
12
of about 175,000 daily COVID–19 cases, over 
13
100,000 daily hospitalized patients, and almost 
14
2,100 daily deaths in the United States. 
15
(4) The COVID–19 pandemic, and the Delta 
16
variant surge in particular, has taken a heavy toll on 
17
our frontline health care heroes, who have been on 
18
the front lines of the pandemic for over a full year 
19
and a half, with many suffering from trauma, burn-
20
out, and increased behavioral health challenges. 
21
(5) Many hospitals have experienced critical 
22
staffing and infrastructure issues due to the surge 
23
demands of very ill patients infected with the Delta 
24
variant of COVID–19, forcing some to make difficult 
25
patient care choices, such as postponing non-emer-
26

•HR 5963 IH
gent surgeries or transferring certain patients, in-
1
cluding children and expectant mothers, to other 
2
hospitals. 
3
(6) These challenges are being exacerbated by 
4
threats of violence against hospitals and their work-
5
force, so much so that a domestic terror alert has 
6
been issued for health care facilities. 
7
(7) 
COVID–19-related 
expenses 
are 
sky-
8
rocketing, as demonstrated in a recent study show-
9
ing that hospitals and health systems are paying 
10
$24,000,000,000 more per year for qualified clinical 
11
labor than they did before the beginning of the 
12
COVID–19 pandemic. 
13
(8) Hospitals and other eligible health care pro-
14
viders need additional funding, and continued access 
15
to Provider Relief Fund funding already received, to 
16
prevent, prepare for, and respond COVID–19, as in-
17
tended under the law, and to protect their facilities 
18
and workforce.
