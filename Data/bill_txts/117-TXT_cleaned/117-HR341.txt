RESOLUTION 
Urging the promotion of equity in the distribution and alloca-
tion of COVID–19 vaccines among Hispanic, Black, 
Asian-American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander, 
and Native American communities. 
Whereas the coronavirus (COVID–19) pandemic has high-
lighted longstanding health, economic, and social inequi-
ties with communities of color continuing to be dispropor-
tionately impacted by the COVID–19 pandemic, includ-

(1) Hispanic populations being more likely to be in-
fected, more than three times as likely to be hospitalized, 
and more than twice as likely to die from COVID–19 
compared to their White counterparts; 
(2) Black communities being more likely to be in-
fected, almost three times as likely to be hospitalized, and 
almost twice as likely to die from COVID–19 compared 
to their White counterparts; 
(3) Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders being 
more likely to be infected, hospitalized, and die from 
COVID–19 compared to their White counterparts and 
continuing to face the highest COVID–19 infection and 
mortality rates out of any racial group in several States; 
and 
(4) American Indian or Alaska Natives being almost 
twice as likely to be infected, three times as likely to be 
hospitalized, and more than twice as likely to die from 
COVID–19; 
Whereas a national strategy to collect demographic data on 
COVID–19 vaccines that include race and ethnicity must 
be established, implemented, and monitored given that 
race and ethnicity are known for just over half of the 
people who have received at least one dose of the vaccine; 
Whereas significant data gaps related to COVID–19 in 
Asian-American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander, 
and American Indian and Alaska Native communities 
continue to exist, inhibiting the ability to tailor targeted 
health interventions, resources, and outreach to these 
communities; 
Whereas about 6 out of 10 Black and Hispanic adults say 
they do not have enough information about where to re-
ceive a COVID–19 vaccine, compared to about half of

White adults, which further undermines vaccination ef-
forts and increases the vulnerability of Black and His-
panic communities; 
Whereas about half of farmworkers indicated they were un-
sure of getting vaccinated when a vaccine became avail-
able to them due to fear of side effects, mistrust of gov-
ernment, cost, and fear that the vaccine could start a 
COVID–19 infection; 
Whereas communities of color tend to have fewer pharmacies 
per capita, putting them at a disadvantage in COVID– 
19 vaccination efforts; 
Whereas preexisting conditions like diabetes, heart and lung 
disease, and hypertension put communities of color at 
higher risk of COVID–19 complications, especially His-
panics who have the highest uninsured rate of any demo-
graphic group; 
Whereas 30 State health departments do not report COVID– 
19 cases for Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders and 
34 State health departments do not report COVID–19 
deaths for Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders de-
spite the significant disparities this population continues 
to face; 
Whereas immigrant communities are largely Hispanic and 
Asian populations, with approximately one-third of both 
Asians and Hispanics being limited-English proficient, 
which has often impeded access to life-saving care and in-
formation throughout the pandemic; 
Whereas the public charge rule has caused fear and confusion 
for immigrant communities discouraging them from using 
critical health and social benefit programs;

Whereas the United States has a longstanding history of rac-
ism, mistreatment, and discrimination against Black, 
Hispanic, Asian-American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific 
Islander, Native American, and other communities of 
color; and 
Whereas the right to health care is among the internationally 
agreed-upon human rights: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—

(C) ensure that the COVID–19 vaccine 
14
cannot be denied to individuals based on immi-
15
gration status; and

(D) implement worksite vaccination clinics

targeting the hardest hit industries in hot spot
