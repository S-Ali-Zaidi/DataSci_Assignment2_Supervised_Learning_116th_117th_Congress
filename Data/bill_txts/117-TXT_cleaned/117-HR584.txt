RESOLUTION 
Highlighting the importance of Title 42 Public Health 
Authorities. 
Whereas President Donald Trump ordered the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention to implement Title 42 
Public Health Authorities allowing for immediate expul-
sion of persons or property to avoid the introduction of 
a communicable disease from a foreign country; 
Whereas Title 42 Public Health Authorities have helped pro-
tect United States citizens from exposure to COVID–19 
from migration at the southern border; 
Whereas ending the critical health protections provided by 
Title 42 would immediately expose United States citizens 
to COVID–19 and numerous COVID–19 variants;
