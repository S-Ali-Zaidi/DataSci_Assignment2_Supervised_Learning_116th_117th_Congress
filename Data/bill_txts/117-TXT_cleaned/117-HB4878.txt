of approximately 6,000 miles extending from Cape

National Seashore in California, extending westward

Kansas, and Colorado. After the two routes rejoin in

13
erally described in Volume 2 of the National Park

15
shall be on file and available for public inspection in 
16

(c) COMPREHENSIVE NATIONAL DISCOVERY TRAIL 
5
PLAN.—Section 7 of such Act (16 U.S.C. 1246) is amend-
6
ed by adding at the end the following: 
7
‘‘(l)(1) For purposes of subsection (5)(b), a trail shall 
8
not be considered feasible and desirable for designation 
9
as a national discovery trail unless it meets all of the fol-
10
lowing criteria: 
11
‘‘(A) The trail must link one or more areas 
12
within the boundaries of a metropolitan area (as 
13
those boundaries are determined under section 
14
134(c) of title 23, United States Code). It should 
15
also join with other trails, connecting the National 
16
Trails System to significant recreation and resources 
17
areas. 
18
‘‘(B) The trail must be supported by at least 
19
one competent trailwide volunteer-based organiza-
20
tion. Each trail should have extensive local and 
21
trailwide support by the public, by user groups, and 
22
by affected State and local governments.

‘‘(C) The trail must be extended and pass 
1
through more than one State. At a minimum, it 
2
should be a continuous, walkable route. 
3
‘‘(2) The appropriate Secretary for each national dis-
4
covery trail shall administer the trail in cooperation with 
5
at least one competent trailwide volunteer-based organiza-
6
tion. Where the designation of discovery trail is aligned 
7
with other units of the National Trails System, or State 
8
or local trails, the designation of a discovery trail shall 
9
not affect the protections or authorities provided for the 
10
other trail or trails, nor shall the designation of a dis-
11
covery trail diminish the values and significance for which 
12
those trails were established. Not later than three com-
13
plete fiscal years after the date of the enactment of any 
14
law designating a national discovery trail, the appropriate 
15
Secretary shall submit a comprehensive plan for the pro-
16
tection, management, development, and use of the trail, 
17
to the Committee on Natural Resources of the United 
18
States House of Representatives and the Committee on 
19
Energy and Natural Resources of the United States Sen-
20
ate. The responsible Secretary shall ensure that the com-
21
prehensive plan for the entire trail does not conflict with 
22
existing agency direction and shall consult with the af-
23
fected land managing agencies, the Governors of the af-
24

tions, and local organizations maintaining components of 
1
the trail. Components of the comprehensive plan include— 
2
‘‘(A) policies and practices to be observed in the 
3
administration and management of the trail, includ-
4
ing the identification of all significant natural, his-
5
torical, and cultural resources to be preserved, model 
6
agreements necessary for joint trail administration 
7
among and between interested parties, and an iden-
8
tified carrying capacity for critical segments of the 
9
trail and a plan for their implementation where ap-
10
propriate; 
11
‘‘(B) general and site-specific trail-related de-
12
velopment including costs; and 
13
‘‘(C) the process to be followed by the volun-
14
teer-based organization, in cooperation with the ap-
15
propriate Secretary, to implement the trail marking 
16
authorities in subsection (c) conforming to approved 
17
trail logo or emblem requirements. Nothing in this 
18
Act may be construed to impose or permit the impo-
19
sition on any landowner on the use of any non-Fed-
20
eral lands without the consent of the owner thereof. 
21
Neither the designation of a national discovery trail 
22
nor any plan relating thereto shall affect or be con-
23
sidered in the granting or denial of a right of way 
24
or any conditions relating thereto.’’.
