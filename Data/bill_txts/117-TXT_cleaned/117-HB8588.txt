(a) UNLIMITED AMOUNT OF DAMAGES FOR ACTUAL 
2
ECONOMIC LOSSES IN HEALTH CARE LAWSUITS.—In any 
3
health care lawsuit, nothing in this Act shall limit a claim-
4
ant’s recovery of the full amount of the available economic 
5
damages, notwithstanding the limitation in subsection (b). 
6
(b) ADDITIONAL NONECONOMIC DAMAGES.—In any 
7
health care lawsuit, the amount of noneconomic damages, 
8
if available, shall not exceed $250,000, regardless of the 
9
number of parties against whom the action is brought or 
10
the number of separate claims or actions brought with re-
11
spect to the same injury.

(c) NO DISCOUNT OF AWARD FOR NONECONOMIC 
13
DAMAGES.—For purposes of applying the limitation in 
14
subsection (b), future noneconomic damages shall not be 
15
discounted to present value. The jury shall not be in-
16

person. Each party shall be liable only for the amount of

judgment of liability is rendered as to any party, a sepa-

5
to restrict the payment of a claimant’s damage recovery

of equity. In no event shall the total of all contingent fees
