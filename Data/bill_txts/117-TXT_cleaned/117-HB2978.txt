SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Build Responsible In-
2
frastructure Development for the Global Economy Act’’ or 
3
the ‘‘BRIDGE Act’’. 
4
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
5
Congress makes the following findings: 
6
(1) The Chinese government’s Belt and Road 
7
Initiative (BRI), enshrined in the CCP’s constitu-
8
tion, is a comprehensive, long-term economic devel-
9
opment strategy founded by General Secretary and 
10
President Xi Jinping to link regions worldwide 
11
through multi-billion infrastructure projects. The 
12
CCP utilizes the BRI’s informal framework as a ve-
13
hicle to establish a Sinocentric world order based on 
14
its authoritarian model of governance. 
15
(2) The BRI poses immediate and long-term 
16
risks to the national security, economic security, and 
17
international influence of the United States and our 
18
partners by giving the PRC the ability to project 
19
power more widely in geostrategic regions such as 
20
the Indo-Pacific. The BRI, covering countries rep-
21
resenting over half of the world’s population and 
22
over one-third of global economic output, seeks to 
23
pull nations into Beijing’s geopolitical orbit. 
24
(3) Despite the BRI’s well-documented scope 
25
and consequences, the United States government has 
26

•HR 2978 IH
never formalized an official view or strategy to 
1
counter its efforts. This puts our national security 
2
objectives at a severe disadvantage as Beijing seeks 
3
to leverage its regional inroads worldwide through 
4
the BRI and other PRC-alternative institutions to 
5
achieve global preeminence. 
6
(4) The United States should not underestimate 
7
the significance of the BRI and establish a coherent, 
8
government-wide strategy that effectively seeks to 
9
counter Beijing’s economic and political scope and 
10
influence through the BRI. 
11
SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
12
It is the policy of the United States to counter efforts 
13
by the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and the Chinese 
14
Communist Party (CCP) to create an integrated economic 
15
and political order under its leadership, which continues 
16
to threaten the national security, foreign policy, and econ-
17
omy of the United States 
18
