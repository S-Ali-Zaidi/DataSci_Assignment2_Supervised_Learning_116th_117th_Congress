•HR 7234 IH
‘‘(1) The term ‘alcohol beverage industry’ 
1
means the brewers, vintners, distillers, importers, 
2
distributors, and retail or online outlets that sell or 
3
serve beer, wine, and distilled spirits. 
4
‘‘(2) The term ‘school-based prevention’ means 
5
programs, which are institutionalized, and run by 
6
staff members or school-designated persons or orga-
7
nizations in any grade of school, kindergarten 
8
through 12th grade. 
9
‘‘(3) The term ‘youth’ means persons under the 
10
age of 21. 
11
‘‘(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of the 
12
Congress that: 
13
‘‘(1) A multifaceted effort is needed to more 
14
successfully address the problem of underage drink-
15
ing in the United States. A coordinated approach to 
16
prevention, intervention, treatment, enforcement, 
17
and research is key to making progress. This section 
18
recognizes the need for a focused national effort, 
19
and addresses particulars of the Federal portion of 
20
that effort, as well as Federal support for State ac-
21
tivities.

range impact of alcohol use and abuse upon adoles-

cent brain development and other organ systems.

‘‘(3) States and communities, including colleges 
3
and universities, are encouraged to adopt com-
4
prehensive prevention approaches, including— 
5
‘‘(A) evidence-based screening, programs, 
6
and curricula; 
7
‘‘(B) brief intervention strategies; 
8
‘‘(C) consistent policy enforcement; and 
9
‘‘(D) science-based strategies to reduce un-
10
derage drinking. 
11
‘‘(4) Public health groups, consumer groups, 
12
and the alcohol beverage industry should continue 
13
and expand evidence-based efforts to prevent and re-
14
duce underage drinking. 
15
‘‘(5) The entertainment industries and social 
16
media platforms have a powerful impact on youth, 
17
and they should use rating systems and marketing 
18
codes to reduce the likelihood that underage audi-
19
ences will be exposed to movies, recordings, tele-
20
vision programs, or social media with unsuitable al-
21
cohol content. 
22
‘‘(6) The National Collegiate Athletic Associa-
23
tion, its member colleges and universities, and ath-
24
letic conferences should affirm a commitment to a 
25
21:15 Mar 29, 2022

•HR 7234 IH
policy of discouraging alcohol use among underage 
1
students and other young fans. 
2
‘‘(7) Alcohol is a unique product and should be 
3
regulated differently than other products by the 
4
States and Federal Government. States have pri-
5
mary authority to regulate alcohol distribution and 
6
sale, and the Federal Government should support 
7
and supplement these State efforts. States also have 
8
a responsibility to fight youth access to alcohol and 
9
reduce underage drinking. Continued State regula-
10
tion and licensing of the manufacture, importation, 
11
sale, distribution, transportation, and storage of al-
12
coholic beverages are clearly in the public interest 
13
and are critical to promoting responsible consump-
14
tion, preventing illegal access to alcohol by persons 
15
under 21 years of age from commercial and non-
16
commercial sources, maintaining industry integrity 
17
and an orderly marketplace, and furthering effective 
18
State tax collection. 
19
‘‘(8) The age-21 minimum drinking law, en-
20
acted in 1984, has been a remarkably effective pub-
21
lic health and safety policy, as evidenced by the fact 
22
that the percentage of 12th graders who have drunk 
23
alcohol in the past month has fallen by one-half 
24
since the enactment of such law.

‘‘(9) The age-21 law has also has been signifi-
1
cantly effective in reducing drinking and driving

traffic fatalities, as the National Highway Traffic 
3
Safety Administration (NHTSA) estimates that the 
4
age-21 law has saved over 31,000 lives since its in-
5
ception.
