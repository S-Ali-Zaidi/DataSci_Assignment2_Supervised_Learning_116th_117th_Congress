SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
5
Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) The Housing Choice Voucher program is 
7
the Federal Government’s largest program helping 
8
low-income families, the elderly, and persons with 
9
disabilities to afford decent, safe, and sanitary hous-
10
ing in the private market. 
11
(2) The Housing Choice Voucher program is 
12
proven to have positive impacts on voucher holders, 
13
including increased housing stability, reduced home-
14
lessness, and children lifted out of poverty. 
15
(3) As a public-private partnership, the Hous-
16
ing Choice Voucher program relies on the willingness 
17
of private landlords to accept vouchers. 
18
(4) Landlord participation is declining in the 
19
Housing Choice Voucher program, with an average 
20
of 10,000 housing providers leaving the program 
21
each year between 2010 and 2016. 
22
(5) Landlord participation is especially lacking 
23
in ‘‘high-opportunity neighborhoods’’ that have low 
24

•HR 6880 IH
poverty rates and good access to quality schools, 
1
jobs, and public transportation. 
2
(6) The Secretary has conducted and continues 
3
to conduct research on landlord participation in the 
4
Housing Choice Voucher program. 
5
(7) The Moving to Work demonstration pro-
6
gram of the Department of Housing and Urban De-
7
velopment has given participating public housing 
8
agencies the ability to test innovative strategies to 
9
incentivize landlords to accept vouchers. 
10
SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
11
It is the sense of Congress that— 
12
(1) the Housing Choice Voucher program 
13
should be improved to increase the number of land-
14
lords, particularly landlords with units in high-op-
15
portunity neighborhoods, who accept vouchers in 
16
order to expand housing choice and opportunity, and 
17
further fair housing; and 
18
(2) Federal programs to help people afford safe 
19
and decent housing are important in all commu-
20
nities, including urban, rural, and tribal areas.
