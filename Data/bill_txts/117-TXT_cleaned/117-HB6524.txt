A BILL 
To require the Secretary of the Treasury to carry out a 
study on Chinese support for Afghan illicit finance, and 
for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. STUDY ON CHINESE SUPPORT FOR AFGHAN IL-
3
LICIT FINANCE. 
4
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) Though China and Afghanistan share only 
6
a small land border, when it comes to illicit financial 
7
activity between the two countries, China has a dem-
8
onstrated history of permissiveness regarding traf-

ficking and money laundering that could support 
1
both the Taliban and its associates. 
2
(2) A 2014 Financial Action Task Force report 
3
titled, ‘‘Financial Flows Linked to the Production 
4
and Trafficking of Afghan Opiates’’ found evidence 
5
of import/export companies registered in China that 
6
were transferring funds to Afghanistan, likely as 
7
part of trade-based money laundering schemes cen-
8
tered around illicit opium production and trafficking, 
9
which, per the United Nations Office on Drugs and 
10
Crime (UNODC), is one of the Taliban’s main 
11
sources of income. 
12
(3) Since the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan 
13
in August 2021, China has announced its willingness 
14
to lend financial support and legitimacy to the 
15
Taliban-led government in Afghanistan, including 
16
Afghan Interior Minister, Sirajuddin Haqqani, a 
17
member of the U.S.-sanctions designated Foreign 
18
Terrorist Organization, the Haqqani Network. 
19
(4) China’s permissive policies regarding Af-
20
ghan illicit finance run counter to the strategic in-
21
terests of the United States with respect to coun-
22
tering trafficking and preventing terrorist groups 
23
from accessing the international financial system.

(5) China’s role as a critical source of financial 
1
wherewithal for the Taliban and its associates to 
2
process and implement drug and other illicit-activity 
3
transactions warrants further study as these actions 
4
pose a threat both to the safety and security of the 
5
people of Afghanistan and the international commu-
6
nity. 
7
(6) Congress needs to better understand how 
8
China could leverage its relationships and resources 
9
within Afghanistan and how these activities could di-
10
rectly or indirectly provide financial support to ter-
11
rorist organizations, including the Taliban and its 
12
associates. 
13
(b) STUDY.— 
14
(1) REQUIREMENT.—Not later than one year 
15
after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Sec-
16
retary of the Treasury shall provide to the Com-
17
mittee on Financial Services of the House of Rep-
18
resentatives and the Committee on Banking, Hous-
19
ing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate a report on the 
20
financial activities of China and Chinese entities in 
21
connection with the finances of Afghanistan and the 
22
Taliban.
