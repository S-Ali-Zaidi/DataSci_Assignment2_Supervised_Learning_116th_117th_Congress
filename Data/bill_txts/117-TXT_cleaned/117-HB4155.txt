newable energy generation characteristics of a 
1
house; 
2
(C) expected energy cost savings resulting 
3
from efficiency measures and/or the generation

of energy from solar panels and/or other renew-
5
ables are in many cases important to the value

11
ciency or renewable energy generation features

(2) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this section is 
14
to— 
15
(A) improve the credibility and reliability 
16

17
by ensuring that the energy efficient and renew-
18
able energy generation features and energy 
19
costs of those houses are included in the ap-
20
praisal analysis, which would place value on en-
21
ergy efficient and renewable energy features of 
22
a house and facilitate the creation of energy ef-
23
ficiency retrofit, renewable installation, and 
24
construction jobs; and

•HR 4155 IH
(B) require the Secretary to— 
1
(i) develop consistent enhanced energy 
2
appraisal protocols that recognize all appli-
3
cable approaches to the value of a house, 
4
including the cost and income approaches 
5
to value, in analyzing energy efficiency and 
6
renewable energy features; 
7
(ii) ensure that the guidelines de-
8
scribed in clause (i) prevent the double 
9
counting of energy cost savings in the valu-
10
ation of a house; 
11
(iii) support safe and sound lending; 
12
and
