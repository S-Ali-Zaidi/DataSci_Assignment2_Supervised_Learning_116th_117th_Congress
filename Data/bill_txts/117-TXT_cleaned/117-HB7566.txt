To amend title 18, United States Code, to increase the 
punishment for human trafficking in a school zone, and 
for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Stop Human Traf-
4
ficking in School Zones Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds as follows: 
7
(1) Child sex trafficking can have devastating 
8
immediate and long-term consequences, including

health impacts, psychological and physical trauma, 
1
and even death. 
2
(2) While any child can be targeted by a traf-
3
ficker, research, data, survivors’ lived experiences, 
4
and expertise have revealed that traffickers often 
5
target vulnerable youth who lack strong support net-
6
works, supervision, care, or basic necessities, have 
7
low self-esteem, have experienced violence in the 
8
past, are experiencing homelessness, are experi-
9
encing academic difficulties, or are marginalized by 
10
society, and lure them into forced labor and pros-
11
titution and other forms of sexual exploitation. Traf-
12
fickers are masters of manipulation and prey upon 
13
vulnerabilities using psychological pressure, intimi-
14
dation, and drugs to control and sexually exploit the 
15
child for their benefit. 
16
(3) The National Center for Missing and Ex-
17
ploited Children (NCMEC) has received reports of 
18
child sex trafficking in all 50 States, the District of 
19
Columbia, and Puerto Rico. These reports include 
20
incidents occurring in every type of community, in-
21
cluding suburban, rural, urban, and Tribal lands. In 
22
2021, NCMEC received more than 17,200 reports of 
23
possible child sex trafficking.

(4) Of 22,326 trafficking victims and survivors 
1
identified through contacts with the National 
2
Human Trafficking Hotline in 2019, at least 5,359 
3
were under age 18. 
4
(5) Many underage victims of sex trafficking 
5
are students in the United States school system. No 
6
community, school, socioeconomic group, or student 
7
demographic is immune. 
8
(6) While the internet and social media make 
9
up the majority of first encounters, traffickers regu-
10
larly find young people in shopping malls, through 
11
friends, at bus stops, and at schools. Specifically, 
12
traffickers systematically target vulnerable children 
13
and youth by frequenting locations where young peo-
14
ple congregate, including schools. They also use 
15
peers or classmates, who befriend the target and 
16
slowly groom them for the trafficker by bringing the 
17
young person along to parties and other activities. 
18
(7) A 2018 survey reported that 55 percent of 
19
young sex trafficking survivors in Texas were traf-
20
ficked while at school or school activities and 60 per-
21
cent of trafficked adults say they were first groomed 
22
and solicited for trafficking on school campuses. 
23
(8) Schools can and should be safe havens for 
24
students. Schools are best positioned to identify and

students to critical services. Students are more likely 
2
to report instances of sex trafficking, attempted sex 
3
trafficking, or grooming for the purposes of sex traf-
4

FICKING IN SCHOOL ZONES.

Section 1591 of title 18, United States Code, is 
9
amended— 
10
(1) by redesignating subsection (e) as sub-
11

12
(2) by inserting after subsection (d) the fol-
13
lowing:
