RESOLUTION 
Expressing the Sense of Congress that the Eagle Staff shall 
be recognized as the first flag of the sovereign Native 
American Tribal nations and the first flag of the Amer-
icas, and to encourage programs promoting the cultural 
significance of the Eagle Staff. 
Whereas the Eagle Staff, considered the first flag of the 
Americas, represents the stature and honor of a par-
ticular Native American Tribe or Tribes; it commonly 
looks like a shepherd’s staff, wrapped in either otter skin 
or buffalo skin, and featuring eagle feathers; pre-dating 
colonization, the Eagle Staff was the indicator of the 
Tribe’s accomplishments in battle and the integrity and 
honor of its people; today, it is used to represent Tribal 
communities, Native American and First Nation organi-

zations, or a member of an honor society or a service vet-
eran; 
Whereas the Eagle Staff represents Tribal sovereignty, unity, 
and tradition, and reflects the honor bestowed upon the 
individual, Tribal organization, or Tribal elder, the Eagle 
Staff is typically carried by Native American veterans of 
the United States Armed Forces; Native Americans have 
served in greater numbers per capita than any other eth-
nicity across all branches of the military; 
Whereas the Eagle Staff, Governor Cane, and cue stick, all 
represents Tribal sovereignty, unity, and tradition, and 
reflects the honor bestowed upon the individual, Tribal 
organization, or Tribal elder, the Eagle Staff is typically 
carried by Native American veterans of the United States 
Armed Forces; Native Americans have served in greater 
numbers per capita than any other ethnicity across all 
branches of the military; 
Whereas the Eagle Staff is a proud legacy of the Native 
American people, it is the embodiment of the warrior of 
enduring fortitude which together have enabled the 
Tribes to survive policies intended to extinguish their 
race and culture; 
Whereas the Eagle Staff is adorned with eagle feathers sym-
bolizing the remembrance of fallen warriors; because ea-
gles and eagle features are highly revered and federally 
protected, only a few Federal agencies and enrolled Na-
tive people may carry them; the eagle feather is the high-
est award that can be given by a Tribe to its people; 
Whereas the Eagle Staff is recognized by all Native American 
Tribes, First Nations, and other Native American organi-
zations, the Eagle Staff is welcomed into all communities,
