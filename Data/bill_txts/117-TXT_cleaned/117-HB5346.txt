SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
5
The Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) Section 605 of the National Defense Au-
7
thorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 directed the 
8
Secretary of Agriculture to ensure that data on 
9
usage of the supplemental nutrition assistance pro-
10
gram (commonly known as SNAP) by members of 
11
the Armed Forces was shared with the Secretary of 
12
Defense. 
13
(2) The Government Accountability Office 
14
found in 2016 that the Department of Defense had 
15
no coordination effort underway to access such data. 
16
(3) The same 2016 Government Accountability 
17
Office report recommended that the Department of 
18
Defense revise surveys to collect and analyze more 
19
complete data on food assistance utilization among 
20
service members and coordinate with the Depart-
21
ment of Agriculture to leverage its access to data on 
22
service members and their families who use their 
23
programs services. 
24
(4) Section 656 of the National Defense Au-
25
thorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 directed the 
26
23:33 Sep 27, 2021
H5346

•HR 5346 IH
Secretary of Defense to submit a report to the Com-
1
mittees on Armed Services of the Senate and the 
2
House of Representatives on the extent of food inse-
3
curity among members of the Armed Forces and 
4
their dependents by May 1, 2020. 
5
(5) The Conference Report accompanying the 
6
National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 
7
2021 reiterated the importance of the report, ex-
8
tended the deadline for completion to March 31, 
9
2021, and directed the Secretary of Defense to take 
10
necessary action to address any food insecurity 
11
found to exist among members of the Armed Forces 
12
and their dependents. 
13
(6) The Secretary of Defense has still not sub-
14
mitted the report. 
15
(7) Testimony presented before the Committee 
16
on Rules of the House of Representatives on May 
17
27, 2021, revealed that— 
18
(A) 14 percent of active duty service mem-
19
bers experience low or very low food security, 
20
(B) military families of color struggle with 
21
food insecurity at higher rates than their white 
22
peers, 
23
(C) military spouse unemployment is 7 
24
times higher than the national average, 
25
23:33 Sep 27, 2021
H5346

•HR 5346 IH
(D) frequent moves associated with mili-
1
tary lifestyle place additional burdens on the fi-
2
nancial security of military families, and 
3
(E) additional costs for childcare, when 
4
available, further drain household finances. 
5
(8) Research conducted by the Department of 
6
Agriculture shows a clear linkage between food inse-
7
curity and mental health concerns, including anxiety, 
8
depression, and suicidal ideation. 
9
(9) As a result of military service members’ fac-
10
ing barriers in accessing supplemental nutrition as-
11
sistance program benefits, food banks and food pan-
12
tries operate on or near every military base in the 
13
United States, serving food insecure military fami-
14
lies. 
15
(10) The transition from military service to ci-
16
vilian life is often a point of increased hardship, es-
17
pecially for those separating at younger ages and 
18
with few job skills that transition easily to the civil-
19
ian economy. 
20
(11) Unemployment is a significant problem 
21
among Gulf War era II (post 9/11 wars) veterans, 
22
particularly those aged 25–34.
