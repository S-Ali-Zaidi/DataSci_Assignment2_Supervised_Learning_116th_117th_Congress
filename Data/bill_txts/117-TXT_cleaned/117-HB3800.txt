A BILL 
To protect human rights and enhance opportunities for 
LGBTQI people around the world, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Greater Leadership 
4
Overseas for the Benefit of Equality Act of 2021’’ or the 
5
‘‘GLOBE Act of 2021’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
7
Congress finds the following: 
8
(1) The norms of good governance, human 
9
rights protections, and the rule of law have been vio-
10
lated unconscionably with respect to lesbian, gay, bi-
11
sexual, transgender, queer, and intersex (LGBTQI) 
12
peoples in an overwhelming majority of countries 
13
around the world, where LGBTQI people face vio-
14
lence, hatred, bigotry, and discrimination because of 
15
who they are and whom they love. 
16
(2) In at least 68 countries, or almost 40 per-
17
cent of the world, same-sex relations and relation-
18
ships are criminalized. Many countries also crim-
19
inalize or otherwise prohibit cross-dressing and gen-
20
der-affirming treatments for transgender individuals.

(3) The World Bank has begun to measure the 
1
macro-economic costs of criminal laws targeting 
2
LGBTQI individuals through lost productivity, detri-
3
mental health outcomes and violence, as a step to-
4
ward mitigating those costs. 
5
(4) Violence and discrimination based on sexual 
6
orientation and gender identity are documented in 
7
the Department of State’s annual Country Human 
8
Rights Reports to Congress. These reports continue 
9
to show a clear pattern of human rights violations, 
10
including murder, rape, torture, death threats, extor-
11
tion, and imprisonment, in every region of the world 
12
based on sexual orientation and gender identity. In 
13
many instances police, prison, military, and civilian 
14
government authorities have been directly complicit 
15
in abuses aimed at LGBTQI citizens. 
16
(5) As documented by the State Department, 
17
LGBTQI individuals are subjected in many coun-
18
tries to capricious imprisonment, loss of employ-
19
ment, housing, access to health care, and societal 
20
stigma and discrimination. LGBTQI-specific restric-
21
tions on basic freedoms of assembly, press, and 
22
speech exist in every region of the world.

(6) Targeted sanctions are an important tool to 
1
push for accountability for violations of the human 
2
rights of LGBTQI people. 
3
(7) Anti-LGBTQI laws and discrimination pose 
4
significant risks for LGBTQI youth who come out to 
5
their family or community and often face rejection, 
6
homelessness, and limited educational and economic 
7
opportunities. These factors contribute to increased 
8
risks of substance abuse, suicide, and HIV infection 
9
among LGBTQI youth. 
10
(8) Anti-LGBTQI laws also increase global 
11
health risks. Studies have shown that when 
12
LGBTQI people, especially LGBTQI youth, face dis-
13
crimination, they are less likely to seek HIV testing, 
14
prevention, and treatment services. 
15
(9) LGBTQI populations are disproportionately 
16
impacted by the Mexico City Policy, also widely re-
17
ferred to as the ‘‘global gag rule’’. LGBTQI people 
18
often receive much of their health care through re-
19
productive health clinics, and organizations that can-
20
not comply with the policy are forced to discontinue 
21
work on United States-supported global health 
22
projects that are frequently used by LGBTQI popu-
23
lations, including HIV prevention and treatment, 
24
stigma reduction, and research.

(10) Because they face tremendous discrimina-
1
tion in the formal labor sector, many sex workers 
2
are also LGBTQI individuals, and many sex-worker- 
3
led programs and clinics serve the LGBTQI commu-
4
nity with safe, non-stigmatizing, medical and social 
5
care. USAID has also referred to sex workers as a 
6
‘‘most-at-risk population’’. The anti-prostitution loy-
7
alty oath that health care providers receiving United 
8
States assistance must take isolates sex-worker-led 
9
and serving groups from programs and reinforces 
10
stigma, undermining both the global AIDS response 
11
and human rights. The Supreme Court found this 
12
requirement unconstitutional as it applies to United 
13
States nongovernmental organizations and their for-
14
eign affiliates in 2013. 
15
(11) According to the Trans Murder Monitoring 
16
Project, which monitors homicides of transgender in-
17
dividuals, there were at least 350 cases of reported 
18
killings of trans and gender-diverse people between 
19
October 2019 and September 2020, an increase over 
20
previous years. 
21
(12) In many countries, intersex individuals ex-
22
perience prejudice and discrimination because their 
23
bodies do not conform to general expectations about 
24
sex and gender. Because of these expectations, medi-
25

•HR 3800 IH
cally unnecessary interventions are often performed 
1
in infancy without the consent or approval of 
2
intersex individuals, in violation of international 
3
human rights standards. 
4
(13) Asylum and refugee protection are critical 
5
last-resort protections for LGBTQI individuals, but 
6
those who seek such protections face ostracization 
7
and abuse in refugee camps and detention facilities. 
8
They are frequently targeted for violence, including 
9
sexual assault, in refugee camps and in immigration 
10
detention. LGBTQI individuals may be segregated 
11
against their will for long periods in solitary confine-
12
ment, in an effort to protect them from such vio-
13
lence, but prolonged solitary confinement itself rep-
14
resents an additional form of abuse that is pro-
15
foundly damaging to the social and psychological 
16
well-being of any individual. 
17
(14) The global COVID–19 pandemic has exac-
18
erbated inequalities that LGBTQI individuals face, 
19
including access to health care, stigma, and discrimi-
20
nation, undermining LGBTQI rights around the 
21
world. 
22
(15) In December 2011, President Barack 
23
Obama directed all Federal foreign affairs agencies 
24
to ensure that their diplomatic, humanitarian, health

and foreign assistance programs take into account 
1
the needs of marginalized LGBTQI communities 
2
and persons. 
3
(16) In 2015, the Department of State estab-
4
lished the position of Special Envoy for the Human 
5
Rights of LGBTQI Persons. 
6
(17) In 2021, President Joseph Biden issued 
7
the Memorandum on Advancing the Human Rights 
8
of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and 
9
Intersex Persons Around the World, which stated 
10
that it is the policy of the United States to pursue 
11
an end to violence and discrimination on the basis 
12
of sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, 
13
or sex characteristics and called for United States 
14
global leadership on LGBTQI rights. 
15
(18) In Bostock v. Clayton County, the Su-
16
preme Court held that title VII of the Civil Rights 
17
Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of 
18
gender identity and sexual orientation. On January 
19
20, 2021, President Biden issued Executive Order 
20
13988 to enforce Bostock, which orders all agency 
21
heads to determine the additional steps they should 
22
take to ensure that administration policies are fully 
23
implemented consistent with Bostock, including the 
24
Secretary of State and the Administrator of USAID.

(19) The use of United States diplomatic tools, 
1
including the Department of State’s exchange and 
2
speaker programs, to address the human rights 
3
needs of marginalized communities has helped in-
4
form public debates in many countries regarding the 
5
protective responsibilities of any democratic govern-
6
ment. 
7
(20) Inclusion of human rights protections for 
8
LGBTQI individuals in United States trade agree-
9
ments, as in the United States-Mexico-Canada 
10
Agreement, and trade preference programs is in-
11
tended both to ensure a level playing field for United 
12
States business and to provide greater workplace 
13
protections overseas, compatible with those of the 
14
United States. 
15
(21) Engaging multilateral fora and inter-
16
national institutions is critical to impacting global 
17
norms and to broadening global commitments to 
18
fairer standards for the treatment of all people, in-
19
cluding LGBTQI. The United States must remain a 
20
leader in the United Nations system and has a vest-
21
ed interest in the success of that multilateral en-
22
gagement.

4

(23) Those who represent the United States
