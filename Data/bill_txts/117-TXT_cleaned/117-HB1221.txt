SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress makes the following findings: 
2
(1) The transportation sector is the largest sin-
3
gle source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United 
4
States. 
5
(2) The transportation sector is also a major 
6
source of air pollution in the United States, includ-
7
ing over 55 percent of total nitrogen oxide emissions, 
8
leading to poor air quality and negative health im-
9
pacts, particularly in urban areas. 
10
(3) Increasing the deployment of electric vehi-
11
cles and electric vehicle charging infrastructure is an 
12
essential component of combating climate change, 
13
decarbonizing the economy, and reducing greenhouse 
14
gas emissions and health-harming air pollution in 
15
the United States. 
16
(4) Industries relating to electric vehicles, elec-
17
tric vehicle charging infrastructure, and the larger 
18
clean energy economy are substantial and diverse 
19
sources of good jobs and significant contributors to 
20
economic growth. 
21
(5) A substantial increase in electric vehicle 
22
charging infrastructure, including publicly accessible 
23
charging stations, will ensure that our communities 
24
are ready to meet the demands of expected electric 
25
vehicle adoption as we decarbonize our economy.

(6) Low-income communities, communities of 
1
color, and Tribal communities bear disproportionate 
2
climate change and pollution burdens, yet have his-
3
torically received the least investment in clean tech-
4
nologies and resilient infrastructure. Therefore, such 
5
communities must be among the first to receive in-
6
vestment relating to new technologies and infra-
7
structure that address the climate crisis and miti-
8
gate localized environmental pollution.
