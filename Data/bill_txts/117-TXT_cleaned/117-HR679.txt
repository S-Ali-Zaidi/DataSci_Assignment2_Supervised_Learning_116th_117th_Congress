ARTICLE I 
1
The Constitution provides that the House of Rep-
2
resentatives ‘‘shall have the sole Power of Impeachment’’ 
3
and that the Vice President ‘‘shall be removed from Office 
4
on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, 
5
or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors’’. In her conduct 
6
of the office of Vice President of the United States—and 
7
in violation of her constitutional oath faithfully to execute 
8
the office of Vice President of the United States and, to 
9
the best of her ability, preserve, protect, and defend the 
10
Constitution of the United States, and in violation of her 
11
constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully 
12
executed—Kamala Devi Harris has betrayed the public 
13
trust as Vice President of the United States, in that: 
14
Vice President Harris has violated her oath of office 
15
to support and defend the Constitution of the United 
16
States against enemies foreign and domestic by supporting 
17
President Biden’s abysmal oversight of the withdrawal of 
18
United States troops from Afghanistan. 
19
On April 25, 2021, Vice President Harris confirmed 
20
she was the last person in the room when President Biden 
21
made the decision to withdraw the troops from Afghani-
22
stan and stated, ‘‘I have seen him over and over again 
23
make decisions based exactly on what he believes is right’’.

Vice President Harris neglected her duties as Vice 
1
President by failing to invoke the 25th Amendment to re-
2
move President Biden from office due to his clear inability 
3
to effectively and competently handle his duties as Com-
4
mander in Chief. President Biden has demonstrated re-
5
peated memory issues that range from forgetting the name 
6
of the Pentagon, Department of Defense, and Secretary 
7
of Defense, to forgetting the purpose of his visit to survey 
8
winter storm damage in Texas. He has also refused mul-
9
tiple times to take a Montreal Cognitive Assessment 
10
(MOCA), like his predecessor, at the request of Members 
11
of Congress. Furthermore, the American people have lost 
12
trust in President Biden’s ability to lead. As of August 
13
22, 2021, 51 percent of Americans do not feel that Presi-
14
dent Biden has acted competently as President of the 
15
United States, 74 percent of Americans believe the re-
16
moval of American troops from Afghanistan has gone 
17
badly, and 50 percent of Americans disapprove of the way 
18
President Biden is handling his job as Commander in 
19
Chief. By neglecting to invoke the 25th Amendment, Vice 
20
President Kamala Harris has betrayed the public trust. 
21
On August 23, 2021, Vice President Harris called 
22
President Biden’s plan to withdraw American troops from 
23
Afghanistan ‘‘courageous and fair’’. This decision has re-
24
sulted in the Taliban gaining full control of Afghanistan

and jeopardized the safety of, and in some cases directly 
1
resulted in the death of, United States citizens, United 
2
States Armed Forces members, and Afghan civilians. 
3
The withdrawal Vice President Harris characterized 
4
as ‘‘courageous and fair’’ has resulted in the rapid take-
5
over of Afghanistan by the Taliban and has compromised 
6
the physical security of tens of thousands of United States 
7
military personnel, United States Government operatives, 
8
United States civilians, Afghan allies, other international 
9
allies, and tens of billions of dollars of advanced United 
10
States military equipment. 
11
The withdrawal Vice President Harris characterized 
12
as ‘‘courageous and fair’’ has led to international con-
13
demnation of the United States, including from our allies. 
14
The withdrawal Vice President Harris characterized 
15
as ‘‘courageous and fair’’ has diminished the United 
16
States standing on the international stage, allowing adver-
17
saries such as Russia and China to call into question the 
18
ability of the United States to fulfill its military and de-
19
fense commitments. 
20
On August 22, 2021, Vice President Harris neglected 
21
her duties as Vice President and ignored the crisis in Af-
22
ghanistan by taking a week-long regional tour of South-
23
east Asia amidst the fall of Kabul and a suicide bomb ex-
24
plosion executed by terrorist group ISIS–K that occurred

at Hamid Karzai International Airport, killing 11 Ma-
1
rines, 1 Navy Medic, and 1 Army soldier, and injuring 
2
over 20 Americans. 
3
In doing this, Vice President Kamala Devi Harris has 
4
directly betrayed the public trust of the United States, to 
5
the manifest injury of the people of the United States. 
6
Vice President Harris by such conduct, has dem-
7
onstrated that she will remain a threat to national security 
8
and the Constitution if allowed to remain in office, and 
9
has acted in a manner grossly incompatible with self-gov-
10
ernance and the rule of law. Vice President Harris thus 
11
warrants impeachment and trial, removal from office, and 
12
disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, 
13
trust, or profit under the United States.
