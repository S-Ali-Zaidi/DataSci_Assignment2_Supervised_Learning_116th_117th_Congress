a Foreign Terrorist Organization in 2013, and supports 
efforts to defeat Boko Haram with security and develop-
ment tools;

is engaged in an armed revolt against the Government of 
Nigeria, and has carried out vicious campaigns of vio-
lence against schools, public institutions, law enforce-
ment, and civilians; 
Whereas, since 2012, Boko Haram has conducted brutal 
mass kidnappings of women, girls, and boys, and has ab-
ducted thousands of women and girls from schools and 
markets, during raids on villages and houses, and on 
public transportation; 
Whereas, on April 14, 2014, Boko Haram militants attacked 
a boarding school in Chibok in Borno State, where girls 
from surrounding areas had gathered to take final exams;

Whereas the international community, including the United 
Nations Secretary-General and the United Nations Secu-
rity Council, condemned the abduction and called for the 
immediate release of the girls; 
Whereas Boko Haram ruthlessly killed some of the kidnapped 
girls for trying to escape, while other girls died during 
childbirth while in captivity; 
Whereas thousands of women, girls, and boys kidnapped by 
Boko Haram have endured similar horrific experiences; 
Whereas the parents of the kidnapped girls and concerned 
citizens banded together and embarked upon a global 
awareness campaign to urge the rescue of the girls, using 
the Twitter hashtag #BringBackOurGirls, through which 
more than 3,300,000 people around the world expressed 
their outrage at the abductions and continue maintaining 
a vigil for the girls’ return to their families; 
Whereas the United States Government sent advisors to Ni-
geria and supplied surveillance and reconnaissance to 
help rescue the girls; 
Whereas 21 of the kidnapped girls were released in October 
2016, and an additional 82 girls were released in May 
2017; 
Whereas nearly 7 years since their abduction, the fate of 
many of the girls remains unknown and as many as 100 
or more remain in captivity and are subjected to deplor-
able abuses as recounted by the girls who have been re-
leased; 
Whereas many of the released girls are being kept in a gov-
ernment facility in Abuja away from their families;

tion continues to mount attacks against civilians, schools,

to choose between forced marriages to its fighters (for 
the purpose of sexual slavery) or becoming suicide bomb-
ers; 
Whereas, on February 19, 2018, Boko Haram militants 
stormed the town of Dapchi and abducted 110 girls from 
the Government Girls Science and Technical School and 
2 other children; 
Whereas 106 of the children from the Dapchi kidnapping 
have been released and 5 of the children are presumed 
to have died in captivity; 
Whereas Leah Sharibu remains a hostage because she refuses 
to convert to Islam; 
Whereas according to the International Committee of the Red 
Cross, an estimated two million people have been dis-
placed from their homes in northeast Nigeria; 
Whereas for several years the United States Government has 
provided assistance for women and girls targeted by Boko 
Haram and individuals displaced by Boko Haram vio-
lence, and has assisted in combating Boko Haram; 
Whereas in section 1(c) of Public Law 114–266 (130 Stat. 
1383), Congress stated that ‘‘lack of economic oppor-
tunity and access to education, justice, and other social 
services contributes to the ability of Boko Haram to 
radicalize and recruit individuals’’; 
Whereas educating girls transforms societies for the better by 
giving girls the knowledge and tools to make positive de-
cisions about their futures, live healthier lives, provide

to combat child marriage; 
Whereas in section 2 of the Women, Peace, and Security Act 
of 2017 (Public Law 115–68; 131 Stat. 1202), Congress 
found that ‘‘[w]omen in conflict-affected regions have 
achieved significant success in . . . moderating violent 
extremism . . . and stabilizing societies by enhancing the 
effectiveness of security services, peacekeeping efforts, in-
stitutions, and decisionmaking processes’’; and 
Whereas section 4 of the Women, Peace, and Security Act of 
2017 (22 U.S.C. 2152j) states, ‘‘It shall be the policy of 
the United States to promote the meaningful participa-
tion of women in all aspects of overseas conflict preven-

and recovery efforts’’: Now, therefore, be it
