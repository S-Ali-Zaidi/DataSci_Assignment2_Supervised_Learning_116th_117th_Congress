RESOLUTION 
Supporting the observation of National Trafficking and Mod-
ern Slavery Prevention Month during the period begin-
ning on January 1, 2022, and ending on February 1, 
2022, to raise awareness of, and opposition to, human 
trafficking and modern slavery. 
Whereas the United States abolished the transatlantic slave 
trade in 1808 and abolished chattel slavery and prohib-
ited involuntary servitude in 1865; 
Whereas, because the people of the United States remain 
committed to protecting individual freedom, there is a na-
tional imperative to eliminate human trafficking and 
modern slavery, which is commonly considered to mean—

•HRES 893 IH 
(1) the recruitment, harboring, transportation, pro-
vision, or obtaining of an individual through the use of 
force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of subjecting 
that individual to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt 
bondage, or slavery; or 
(2) the inducement of a commercial sex act by force, 
fraud, or coercion, or in which the individual induced to 
perform that act is younger than 18 years of age; 
Whereas forced labor and human trafficking generates reve-
nues of approximately $150,000,000,000 annually world-
wide, and there are an estimated 40,000,000 victims of 
human trafficking and modern slavery across the globe; 
Whereas victims of human trafficking are difficult to identify 
and are subject to manipulation, force, fraud, coercion, 
and abuse; 
Whereas the Department of Justice has reported that human 
trafficking and modern slavery has been reported and in-
vestigated in each of the 50 States and the District of 
Columbia; 
Whereas the Department of State has reported that the top 
3 countries of origin of federally identified human traf-
ficking victims in the United States in fiscal year 2020 
were the United States, Mexico, and Honduras; 
Whereas, to help businesses in the United States combat 
child labor and forced labor in global supply chains, the 
Department of Labor has identified 156 goods from 77 
countries that are made by child labor and forced labor; 
Whereas, since 2007, the National Human Trafficking Hot-
line has identified nearly 74,000 cases of human traf-
ficking;

Whereas, of the more than 26,500 endangered runaways re-
ported to the National Center for Missing and Exploited 
Children in 2020, 1 in 6 were likely child sex trafficking 
victims; 
Whereas youth experiencing homelessness experience high 
rates of human trafficking and 1 in 5 homeless youths 
is a victim of sex trafficking, labor trafficking, or both; 
Whereas the Administration for Native Americans of the De-
partment of Health and Human Services reports that 
American Indian, Alaska Native, and Pacific Islander 
women and girls have a heightened risk for sex traf-
ficking; 
Whereas the Department of Justice found that studies on the 
topic of human trafficking of American Indians and Alas-
ka Natives suggest there are— 
(1) high rates of sexual exploitation of Native 
women and girls; 
(2) gaps in data and research on trafficking of 
American Indian and Alaska Native victims; and 
(3) barriers that prevent law enforcement agencies 
and victim service providers from identifying and re-
sponding appropriately to Native victims; 
Whereas, according to the Government Accountability Office, 
from fiscal year 2013 through fiscal year 2016, there 
were only 14 Federal investigations and 2 Federal pros-
ecutions of human trafficking offenses in Indian country; 
Whereas, to combat human trafficking and modern slavery in 
the United States and globally, the people of the United 
States, the Federal Government, and State, Tribal, and 
local governments must be—

•HRES 893 IH 
(1) aware of the realities of human trafficking and 
modern slavery; and 
(2) dedicated to stopping the horrific enterprise of 
human trafficking and modern slavery; 
Whereas the United States should hold accountable all indi-
viduals, groups, organizations, governments, and coun-
tries that support, advance, or commit acts of human 
trafficking and modern slavery; 
Whereas, through education, the United States must also 
work to end human trafficking and modern slavery in all 
forms in the United States and around the world; 
Whereas victims of human trafficking deserve a trauma-in-
formed approach that integrates the pursuit of justice 
and provision of social services designed to help them es-
cape, and recover from, the physical, mental, emotional, 
and spiritual trauma they endured; 
Whereas combating human trafficking requires a whole-of- 
government effort that rests on a unified and coordinated 
response among Federal, State, Tribal, and local agencies 
and that places equal value on the prevention of traf-
ficking, the identification and stabilization of victims, and 
the investigation and prosecution of traffickers; 
Whereas laws to prosecute perpetrators of human trafficking 
and to assist and protect victims of human trafficking 
and modern slavery have been enacted in the United 
States, including— 
(1) the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 
(22 U.S.C. 7101 et seq.); 
(2) title XII of the Violence Against Women Reau-
thorization Act of 2013 (Public Law 113–4; 127 Stat. 
136);

(3) the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 
2015 (Public Law 114–22; 129 Stat. 227); 
(4) sections 910 and 914(e) of the Trade Facilita-
tion and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 (Public Law

(5) section 1298 of the National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (22 U.S.C. 7114); 
(6) the Abolish Human Trafficking Act of 2017 
(Public Law 115–392; 132 Stat. 5250); 
(7) the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2017 
(Public Law 115–393; 132 Stat. 5265); 
(8) the Frederick Douglass Trafficking Victims Pre-
vention and Protection Reauthorization Act of 2018 
(Public Law 115–425; 132 Stat. 5472); and 
(9) the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthoriza-
tion Act of 2017 (Public Law 115–427; 132 Stat. 5503); 
Whereas the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015 
(Public Law 114–22; 129 Stat. 227) established the 
United States Advisory Council on Human Trafficking to 
provide a formal platform for survivors of human traf-
ficking to advise and make recommendations on Federal 
anti-trafficking policies to the Interagency Task Force to 
Monitor and Combat Trafficking established by the 
President; 
Whereas the Department of Defense, the General Services 
Administration, and the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration issued a final rule (80 Fed. Reg. 4967) 
to implement Executive Order 13627, entitled ‘‘Strength-
ening Protections Against Trafficking in Persons in Fed-
eral Contracts’’, that clarifies the policy of the United 
States on combating trafficking in persons as outlined in 
the Federal Acquisition Regulation by strengthening the

prohibition on contractors from charging employee re-
cruitment fees; 
Whereas, although such laws and regulations are currently in 
force, it is essential to increase public awareness, particu-
larly among individuals who are most likely to come into 
contact with victims of human trafficking and modern 
slavery, regarding conditions and dynamics of human 
trafficking and modern slavery, precisely because traf-
fickers use techniques that are designed to severely limit 
self-reporting and evade law enforcement; 
Whereas January 1 is the anniversary of the effective date 
of the Emancipation Proclamation; 
Whereas February 1 is— 
(1) the anniversary of the date on which President 
Abraham Lincoln signed the joint resolution sending the 
13th Amendment to the Constitution of the United 
States to the States for ratification to forever declare, 
‘‘Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a 
punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been 
duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or 
any place subject to their jurisdiction’’; and 
(2) a date that has long been celebrated as National 
Freedom Day, as described in section 124 of title 36, 
United States Code; and 
Whereas, under the authority of Congress to enforce the 13th 
Amendment to the Constitution of the United States ‘‘by 
appropriate legislation’’, Congress, through the Traf-
ficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (22 U.S.C. 7101 
et seq.), updated the post-Civil War involuntary servitude 
and slavery statutes and adopted an approach of victim 
protection, vigorous prosecution, and prevention of
