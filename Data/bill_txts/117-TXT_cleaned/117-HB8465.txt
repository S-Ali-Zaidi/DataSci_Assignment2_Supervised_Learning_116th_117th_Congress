AGAINST

UKRAINE WITH RESPECT TO THREAT OF 
3
WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. 
4
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) The Russian Federation is currently en-
6
gaged in a brutal, illegal, premeditated, and destruc-
7
tive war against the sovereign, democratic country of 
8
Ukraine. 
9
(2) The Russian war on Ukraine is in gross, 
10
clear, and uncorrected violation of the principles of 
11
the Helsinki Final Act, in contravention of the 
12
United Nations Charter, in violation of its obliga-
13
tions under the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, and 
14
an unmitigated moral stain on its countenance. 
15
(3) The Russian leadership has made numerous 
16
implied and overt threats regarding the potential use 
17
of chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons of mass 
18
destruction in connection with its barbaric war on 
19
Ukraine. 
20
(4) The Russian war on Ukraine is not only a 
21
humanitarian catastrophe and a global and national 
22
security crisis, but also a direct and potentially ir-
23
reparable threat to global nonproliferation, including 
24
notorious and gross Russian violations of its obliga-
25
16:15 Aug 01, 2022
H8465
16 
•HR 8465 IH
tions under the Budapest Memorandums and the 
1
conduct of a civilized state. 
2
(5) In exchange for Ukraine eliminating all nu-
3
clear weapons from its territory, the 1994 Budapest 
4
Memorandum committed its signatories, Russia, the 
5
United Kingdom, and the United States, to refrain 
6
from the threat or use of force or economic coercion 
7
against Ukraine, and provided guarantees for the 
8
independence and sovereignty and territorial integ-
9
rity of Ukraine. 
10
(6) The employment of chemical or biological 
11
weapons by Russia would be in violation of its obli-
12
gations under the Chemical Weapons Convention, 
13
the Geneva Protocol, and the Biological Weapons 
14
Convention. 
15
(7) The United States does not seek war, and 
16
urges an immediate end to Russian aggression in 
17
and against Ukraine, but the potential use of chem-
18
ical, biological, or nuclear weapons of mass destruc-
19
tion by the Russian military constitutes grave esca-
20
lation over redlines that imperil United States na-
21
tional security and international peace. 
22
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
23

(1) the President should—

of chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons of

mass destruction, including low-yield ‘‘tactical’’

nuclear weapons, ‘‘false flag’’ operations using 
4
such weapons of mass destruction, and the pur-
5
poseful or deliberate targeting or neglect of nu-
6
clear facilities that leads to a nuclear event, 
7
against or in connection with the Russian war 
8
on Ukraine, would represent crimes against hu-
9
manity; 
10
(B) treat such crimes against humanity as 
11
an urgent national and global security threat 
12
that may require, in concert with other member 
13
states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organiza-
14
tion, the employment of any available conven-
15
tional means as necessary to secure the peace,

including the potential need to degrade and de-

20
the 
legitimate 
democratic 
Government 
of

Ukraine to be able to defend its national sov-
22
