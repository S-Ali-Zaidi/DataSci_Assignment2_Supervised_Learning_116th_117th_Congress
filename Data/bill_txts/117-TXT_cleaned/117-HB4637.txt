Freedmen disenfranchised in the October 6, 1979, Creek 
Nation vote and fulfills all its treaty obligations with 
the Government of the United States, and for other

SECTION 1. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Historically, the Muscogee (Creek) Nation 
3
(‘‘Creek Nation’’) were comprised of a confederacy 
4
of separate towns, Tribes, and peoples. Each town 
5
was a complete governmental unit in and of itself. 
6
Among those peoples were the Yamassee or Jamassi, 
7
who were reported to have emigrated from Africa 
8
prior to the European discovery of America. 
9
(2) As colonists and eventually nonindigenous 
10
Americans began to inhabit this area, these new 
11
residents sought to ‘‘civilize the Creek Indian’’. In 
12
the ensuing decades, the United States continuously 
13
and repeatedly attempted to impose, often by force, 
14
its customs, economy, religion, and political struc-
15
ture on indigenous groups such as the Creek Nation. 
16
(3) One American custom adopted by some 
17
Creek Nation citizens was the plantation economy 
18
and the reliance on chattel African slavery as a labor 
19
force. Along with enslaved Africans who were owned 
20
by Creek Nation citizens, there were also Creek Na-
21
tion citizens of African descent and free Blacks 
22
openly living as full citizens of the Creek Nation. 
23
(4) In the 1830s, citizens of the Creek Nation 
24
were forcibly removed from their lands in the south-
25
eastern United States and forced to migrate to In-
26
18:53 Aug 10, 2021
H4637
3 
•HR 4637 IH
dian Territory (present day Oklahoma) along a route 
1
known as the Trail of Tears. Among those persons 
2
forced to migrate were— 
3
(A) African individuals who were enslaved 
4
by citizens of the Creek Nation; 
5
(B) Creek Nation citizens of ‘‘African de-
6
scent’’; 
7
(C) free ‘‘Africans’’ living as citizens of the 
8
Creek Nation; and 
9
(D) ‘‘mixed blood’’ Creek Nation citizens 
10
now known as the ‘‘Black Creeks’’ or ‘‘Creek 
11
Freedmen’’. 
12
(5) Citizens of the Creek Nation were removed 
13
primarily by their traditional Tribal ‘‘town’’, and it 
14
was the town ‘‘Micos’’ or chiefs who kept the Tribal 
15
rolls. This allowed Creek Nation citizens who sur-
16
vived the journey to reestablish their traditional 
17
towns in Indian Territory. 
18
(6) Removal was carried out by the military, 
19
and approximately 24,000 Creek Nation citizens 
20
were forced to travel to Indian Territory on foot or 
21
by riverboats. Due to poor planning, organization, 
22
and indifference by the Federal Government, thou-
23
sands of Creek Nation citizens died on the way to 
24
18:53 Aug 10, 2021
H4637
4 
•HR 4637 IH
Indian Territory due to exposure, starvation, and 
1
disease. 
2
(7) Even after removal to Indian Territory, 
3
some Creek Nation citizens continued to hold slaves 
4
until the Creek Treaty of 1866 abolished slavery in 
5
the Creek Nation. 
6
(8) In 1861, a faction of the Creek Nation 
7
known as ‘‘Southern Creeks’’ executed a treaty with 
8
the Confederate States of America, severing its rela-
9
tions with the United States Government. Members 
10
of the Southern Creeks held positions in the Con-
11
gress and military of the Confederate States of 
12
America and waged war against the United States 
13
during the Civil War. Other Creeks, known as the 
14
‘‘Loyal Creeks’’, who generally resisted cultural as-
15
similation, provided supplies, men, and support for 
16
the Union. A contingent of Loyal Creeks, which in-
17
cluded a substantial ‘‘Black’’ Creek component, left 
18
their homes in Oklahoma and moved to Kansas to 
19
flee Southern Creek soldiers and their Confederate 
20
allies. 
21
(9) The Battle of Honey Springs was a major 
22
battle that occurred in Indian Territory during the 
23
Civil War, and Loyal Creeks, including ‘‘Black’’ 
24
18:53 Aug 10, 2021
H4637
5 
•HR 4637 IH
Creeks, valiantly fought against the Confederacy and 
1
their allies. 
2
(10) In 1865, as the Civil War ended, President 
3
Andrew Johnson designated a commission to travel 
4
to Fort Smith, Arkansas, to convene a council for 
5
the purpose of negotiating a new treaty with the 
6
Creek Nation. 
7
(11) The members of that commission declared 
8
that a treaty with the United States ‘‘must’’ contain 
9
certain stipulations, including that ‘‘the institution 
10
of slavery, which has existed among several of the 
11
Tribes, must be forthwith abolished, and measures 
12
taken for the unconditional emancipation of all per-
13
sons held in bondage, and for their incorporation 
14
into the Tribes on an equal footing with the original 
15
members, or suitably provided for.’’. 
16
(12) The Creek Nation’s 5-person delegation in-
17
cluded both leaders of the Loyal Creeks and South-
18
ern Creeks. One of the members of the Loyal Creek 
19
delegation was an African Creek named Cow Tom. 
20
(13) The Creek Treaty of 1866 negotiations oc-
21
curred between 1865 and 1866, first in Fort Smith, 
22
Arkansas, and then in Washington, DC. It was in 
23
Washington, DC, where the Treaty was signed and 
24
upon the signing of the 1866 Treaty the United 
25
18:53 Aug 10, 2021
H4637
6 
•HR 4637 IH
States reestablished official relations with the Creek 
1
Nation. 
2
(14) The Creek Treaty of 1866 became the 
3
foundational legal document of the Creek Nation 
4
and established the Creek Nation as it is known 
5
today. 
6
(15) The Creek Treaty of 1866 declared that 
7
the Black Creeks, also known as ‘‘Creek Freedmen’’, 
8
were to be made citizens of the Creek Nation and 
9
to have all the rights of other Creek citizens. 
10
(16) Article II of the Creek Treaty of 1866 pro-
11
vides in pertinent part: 
12
‘‘[I]nasmuch as there are among the Creek 
13
many persons of African descent . . . it is stip-
14
ulated that hereafter these persons, lawfully re-
15
siding in said Creek country, under their laws 
16
and usages, or who have been thus residing in 
17
said country, and may return within one year 
18
from the ratification of this treaty, and their 
19
descendants and such others of the same race 
20
as may be permitted by the laws of said Nation 
21
to settle within the limits of the jurisdiction of 
22
the Creek Nation as citizens [thereof], shall 
23
have and enjoy all the rights and privileges of 
24
native citizens, including an equal interest in 
25
18:53 Aug 10, 2021
H4637
7 
•HR 4637 IH
the soil and national funds; and the laws of said 
1
Nation shall be equally binding upon and give 
2
equal protection to all such persons . . .’’. 
3
(17) Virtually identical clauses relating to the 
4
citizenship of individuals of African descent within 
5
the Seminole and Cherokee Nations were negotiated, 
6
agreed upon, and added to the respective Seminole 
7
and Cherokee Treaties of 1866. 
8
(18) Shortly after executing the Treaty of 
9
1866, the Creek Nation reorganized their constitu-
10
tional structure, and in 1867, it created a new and 
11
expansive constitution which recognized and af-
12
firmed the full citizenship rights of Black Creeks. 
13
(19) The 1867 Constitution did not discrimi-
14
nate against Creeks of African descent, Free Black, 
15
or Creek Freedmen citizens of the Creek Nation. 
16
(20) In fact, upon ratifying the 1867 Constitu-
17
tion, the Creek Nation reconstituted its 44 tradi-
18
tional ‘‘towns’’ and voluntarily created 3 additional 
19
towns (‘‘Freedmen Towns’’) so the Freedmen would 
20
have equal representation in the Creek Nation’s Na-
21
tional Council. 
22
(21) Also, in 1867, the Creek Nation gathered 
23
at the request of Federal Indian Agent J.W. Dunn 
24
18:53 Aug 10, 2021
H4637
8 
•HR 4637 IH
(‘‘Dunn’’) to identify and list the individual mem-
1
bers of the Creek Nation. 
2
(22) As a result of that gathering, Dunn com-
3
piled a roll of the Creek Nation’s citizens, which 
4
came to be known as the ‘‘Dunn Roll’’. Listed on 
5
the Dunn Roll were all of the Creek Nation’s then- 
6
gathered citizens, which encompassed Creek Nation 
7
citizens with African ancestry, including Native Afri-
8
cans, Free Africans, and newly emancipated, for-
9
merly enslaved Creek Freedmen. 
10
(23) Many Creek Nation citizens were forced to 
11
leave Creek Nation territory during the Civil War 
12
because of the violence or for various other reasons. 
13
The Treaty of 1866 gave Creek Nation citizens until 
14
July 15, 1867, to return to Creek territory in order 
15
to be included on the Dunn Roll. However, Dunn 
16
completed his roll 5 months early and sent it to 
17
Washington, DC, in February 1867. 
18
(24) As a result, the Creek Nation created a 
19
Post-Civil War Citizenship Commission to review the 
20
applications of people who claimed they were Creek 
21
Nation citizens who should have been included on 
22
the Dunn Roll. The Creek Nation Post-Civil War 
23
Citizenship Commission reviewed several thousand 
24
applications, and admitted over 1,700 individuals 
25
18:53 Aug 10, 2021
H4637
9 
•HR 4637 IH
and their descendants between 1867 and 1895. Nu-
1
merous Native Africans, Free Blacks, and newly 
2
emancipated Freedmen were among the 1,700 indi-
3
viduals granted full citizenship by the Creek Nation 
4
Post-War Citizenship Commission. 
5
(25) In the decade after the Treaty of 1866 
6
was enacted, individuals of African descent (Native 
7
Africans, Free Africans, and formerly enslaved Afri-
8
can/Freedmen) worked with all other Creek Nation 
9
citizens to attempt to rebuild the Creek Nation. 
10
(26) However, many of the Confederate-aligned 
11
Upper/Southern Creeks refused to respect Creek 
12
Freedmen citizenship rights. In fact, on October 1, 
13
1877, the Upper/Southern actions were rebuked by 
14
then Creek Nation Principal Chief Ward Coachman 
15
during his address to the Creek National Council: 
16
‘‘. . . [A]nd inasmuch as there are Freed-
17
men among us, whose rights under the treaty of 
18
1866, have not by some been recognized, and in 
19
consequence thereof have been discouraged, are 
20
not improving or advancing as they might do; 
21
and the treaty relative thereto being so plain 
22
that no one can mistake or misunderstand it. I 
23
allude particularly to those known as the 
24
McGilvery or McGilbrey Freedmen whom we 
25
18:53 Aug 10, 2021
H4637
10 
•HR 4637 IH
know belonged to our own people, were here 
1
within our country when the treaty was made 
2
and have remained among us ever since. I 
3
would recommend if necessary that some action 
4
be had recognizing the rights of all who under 
5
the treaty are entitled to citizenship and equal 
6
rights and privileges with us.’’. 
7
(27) Between 1867 and 1895, the Creek Nation 
8
created numerous rolls of its citizens. None of these 
9
rolls created by the Creek Nation contained or listed 
10
blood quantum, or singled out Creeks of African de-
11
scent, ‘‘Free Black’’ Creek Citizens, or former 
12
enslaved Africans who were emancipated and accept-
13
ed as Creek citizens pursuant to the Treaty of 1866. 
14
(28) Between 1866 and 1906, Creeks of Afri-
15
can descent were an essential part of the Creek Na-
16
tion community, as evidenced by their service in im-
17
portant and high positions in the Creek Nation’s 
18
government and other areas of Creek life. 
19
(29) In 1887, Congress passed the Dawes Act 
20
of 1887 (‘‘Dawes Act’’). 
21
(30) The stated purpose of the Dawes Act was 
22
to prepare Indian Territory for statehood. To this 
23
end, the Dawes Act authorized the transfer of most 
24
18:53 Aug 10, 2021
H4637
11 
•HR 4637 IH
of the land owned corporately by the Creek Nation 
1
to individual Tribal citizens. 
2
(31) After the passing of the Dawes Act, Con-
3
gress created the Dawes Commission in 1893. Con-
4
gress tasked the Dawes Commission with identifying 
5
all Creek citizens eligible for land allotment in what 
6
would come to be known as the ‘‘Dawes Rolls’’. 
7
(32) Congress then passed the Curtis Act of 
8
June 28, 1898 (30 Stat. 495) (‘‘Curtis Act’’), direct-
9
ing the Dawes Commission to create 2 lists of citi-
10
zens of the Creek Nation who would be eligible for 
11
land allotment, which became the following: 
12
(A) The ‘‘Creek Nation Creek Roll’’, which 
13
was purportedly composed only of Creek Nation 
14
citizens with Creek blood. 
15
(B) The ‘‘Creek Nation Freedmen Roll’’, 
16
which was purportedly composed only of Creek 
17
Nation citizens who were formerly enslaved Af-
18
ricans and devoid of any Creek blood. 
19
(33) The Dawes Commission, motivated by rac-
20
ism, used race and Creek Nation citizens’ physical 
21
appearance to segregate Creeks of African Descent 
22
‘‘Creek Freedmen’’. The ‘‘true’’ Creeks, in the 
23
Dawes Commission’s estimation, were listed on the 
24
Creek Roll (also known as the ‘‘Blood Roll’’). The 
25
18:53 Aug 10, 2021
H4637
12 
•HR 4637 IH
Creek Freedmen (individuals of African descent, re-
1
gardless of whether they or their ancestors were pre-
2
viously enslaved in the Creek Nation) were listed on 
3
the Creek Nation Freedmen Roll. 
4
(34) The Dawes Commission employed the 
5
hypodescent rule, by which any individual with ‘‘one 
6
drop’’ of ‘‘Black blood’’ was to be considered Black 
7
and therefore belonged on the Creek Nation Freed-
8
men Roll. 
9
(35) The Dawes Commission therefore enrolled 
10
many Creeks of African descent on the Creek Freed-
11
men Roll, regardless of whether they or their ances-
12
tors were ever enslaved in the Creek Nation or of 
13
how much ‘‘Creek blood’’ they actually possessed. 
14
(36) The Dawes Commission separated families 
15
by enrolling full siblings with different blood degrees 
16
and enrolling some family members on the Creek 
17
Nation Blood Roll and others on the Creek Freed-
18
men Roll. The blood degree or blood quantum was 
19
originally to be used only for land allotment pur-
20
poses. 
21
(37) Therefore, once the Dawes Rolls closed on 
22
March 4, 1907, Creek citizens enrolled on the 
23
Freedmen Roll and their descendants, in perpetuity, 
24
would always carry the ugly badge of slavery, re-
25
18:53 Aug 10, 2021
H4637
13 
•HR 4637 IH
gardless of whether they or their ancestors were ever 
1
enslaved, and forever legally be known as Creek 
2
Freedmen. 
3
(38) In 1970, Congress passed the ‘‘Principal 
4
Chiefs Act’’ requiring the Chickasaw, Choctaw, 
5
Cherokee, Seminole, and Creek Nations to obtain 
6
approval for their voting laws for selection of each 
7
nation’s Principal Chief. The Department of the In-
8
terior drafted a policy stating that it was not nec-
9
essary that each of these groups has identical or 
10
similar regulations, but that 3 conditions are deemed 
11
fundamental to the democratic selection of a prin-
12
cipal Tribal official. One of the three conditions stip-
13
ulated by the Department was that voter qualifica-
14
tions of the Creeks must be broad enough to include 
15
the enrolled Creek Freedmen citizens. 
16
(39) On or about August 18, 1975, the Creek 
17
Nation, through its National Council, submitted to 
18
the Department of the Interior a draft constitution 
19
(‘‘Draft Constitution’’) that, among other things, 
20
contained express provisions that— 
21
(A) stripped individuals on the 1906 Creek 
22
Freedmen Rolls and their then-living lineal de-
23
scendants of their Creek citizenship; and 
24
18:53 Aug 10, 2021
H4637
14 
•HR 4637 IH
(B) prevented the unborn lineal descend-
1
ants of individuals who were enrolled on the 
2
1906 Creek Freedmen Rolls from becoming citi-
3
zens of the Creek Nation. 
4
(40) Before the Creek Nation submitted the 
5
Draft Constitution to the Department of the Inte-
6
rior, the Creek Nation did not seek, obtain, or allow 
7
any input from Creek Freedmen or individuals rep-
8
resenting Creek Freedmen interests. 
9
(41) Minutes from the Creek Nation’s October 
10
29, 1977, National Council meeting reveal that one 
11
of the express goals of the Draft Constitution was 
12
to strip Freedmen and Creek Freedmen descendants 
13
of their Creek citizenship and rights. The minutes 
14
state the following: 
15
‘‘When you go back to the old [1867] Con-
16
stitution, you are licked before you start; be-
17
cause it doesn’t talk about Indians, it talks 
18
about CITIZENS of the CREEK NATION. 
19
When you got down to the Allotment time, 
20
there were more that was non-Indians or half- 
21
blood or less, who outnumbered the full blood, 
22
all of these totaled about 11,000, and there 
23
were only 18,000 on the entire Roll; so, there 
24
was only 9,000 above One-half blood. That’s 
25
18:53 Aug 10, 2021
H4637
15 
•HR 4637 IH
the reason, they lost control; the FULLBLOOD 
1
lost control. That’s what we’re fighting, this 
2
blood quantum, trying to get back and let the 
3
people control because under the old Constitu-
4
tion, you’ve lost before you ever started. There 
5
were three FREEDMAN bands that would out-
6
number you today as citizens. So, if we want to 
7
keep the INDIAN in control, we’ve got to take 
8
a good look at this thing and get us a Constitu-
9
tion that will keep the Creek Indian in Con-
10
trol.’’. 
11
(42) On October 6, 1979, the Creek Nation 
12
held an election to formally adopt the 1979 Con-
13
stitution and replace the 1867 Constitution. 
14
(43) Section 503 of the Oklahoma Indian Wel-
15
fare Act (25 U.S.C. 5203), in effect since 1979, re-
16
quired the participation of at least 30 percent of 
17
‘‘those entitled’’ to vote, or the results of the election 
18
are invalid. 
19
(44) The total number of ‘‘entitled’’ voters that 
20
Creek officials identified prior to the 1979 constitu-
21
tional referendum did not include Creek Freedmen 
22
in an apparent effort to meet OIWA election re-
23
quirements. Creek Freedmen and their descendants 
24
were denied the right to vote on the 1979 Constitu-
25
18:53 Aug 10, 2021
H4637
16 
•HR 4637 IH
tion and therefore did not vote on the 1979 constitu-
1
tion. 
2
(45) Upon the dubious ratification of the 1979 
3
Constitution, the Creek Nation illegally declared that 
4
all Freedmen were not entitled to Creek citizenship 
5
and would no longer be recognized as nor allowed to 
6
be citizens of the Creek Nation. 
7
(46) Thousands of Creek Freedmen descend-
8
ants have been denied their Creek citizenship rights 
9
in a bold violation of the Treaty of 1866. 
10
(47) In violation of the Treaty of 1866, the 
11
13th Amendment to the United States Constitution, 
12
the Principal Chiefs Act of 1970, and the Oklahoma 
13
Indian Welfare Act, Creek Freedmen have been ille-
14
gally barred from participating, as voters and can-
15
didates, in every Creek election from 1979 through 
16
the present. 
17
(48) Currently, the Creek Nation operates 
18
under a Principal Chief elected in violation of the 
19
1970 Principal Chiefs Act and Treaty of 1866, and 
20
a National Council constituted without Creek Freed-
21
men representatives, in violation of the Treaty of 
22
1866. 
23
(49) Since 1979, thousands of Creek Freedmen 
24
have continuously attempted to assert and regain 
25
18:53 Aug 10, 2021
H4637
17 
•HR 4637 IH
their full citizenship rights by formally applying for 
1
Creek citizenship only to be completely ignored or 
2
summarily rebuffed. Oftentimes Freedmen appli-
3
cants would be informed of their denial via a form 
4
letter from the Creek Nation, which would include 
5
some version of the following language, taken from 
6
a May 31, 2002, letter from the Creek Nation to a 
7
Creek Freedman applicant: 
8
‘‘We are returning your letter and any 
9
other documents submitted for enrollment into 
10
the Muscogee (Creek) Nation because in check-
11
ing the Dawes Commission Rolls, your ances-
12
tors were enrolled on the Creek Freedmen 
13
Rolls. If you will note from the copy you sub-
14
mitted there is no blood quantum listed because 
15
they are not Creek by Blood. When slavery was 
16
abolished following the Civil War, Treaties were 
17
negotiated with the Five-Civilized Tribes; the 
18
Choctaw, Cherokee, Chickasaw, Creek and Sem-
19
inole Nations. The treaties conferred citizenship 
20
in the Tribes on the negroes who had been held 
21
in slavery by the Tribes. Such citizens were re-
22
ferred as ‘Freedmen’.’’. 
23
(50) A Creek Freedmen Indians or African/ 
24
Black Creek Indians association was organized and

continues to work to preserve the unique identity of 
1
members of the Muscogee Creek Indian Freedmen 
2
Band Association, and to protect the history, legacy, 
3
rights, and dignity of the thousands of Creek Freed-
4
men Indians. 
5
(51) Beginning in 2004, 2 Creek Freedmen liti-
6
gated the issue of Creek Freedmen citizenship within 
7
the Creek Nation court in Johnson and Graham v. 
8
Muscogee (Creek) Nation of Oklahoma Citizenship 
9
Board, CV 2003–54. 
10
(52) The Creek Freedmen contended that they 
11
and all Creek Freedmen were eligible for citizenship 
12
in the Creek Nation pursuant to the Treaty of 1866, 
13
the Muscogee (Creek) Nation Constitution, and the 
14
Creek Nation Citizenship Code. 
15
(53) In its March 27, 2006, opinion, the Creek

Nation District Court declined to reach the sub-
17
stantive issues related to the Treaty of 1866. In-

20
that the Citizenship Board process the citizenship 
21
applications of the Creek Freedmen.

2
mously reversed the district court decision and re-

fused to rule on the applicability of the citizenship

provisions of the Treaty of 1866. 
5
(55) The manner in which the Creek Nation is 
6
conducting the relationship between the United 
7
States and the Tribal entity is not in the best inter-
8
est of the United States Government or the citizens 
9
of the Creek Nation, and violates existing treaties 
10
and laws governing the relationship between the 
11
United States Government and the Creek Nation. 
12
(56) The Creek Nation’s current refusal to rec-
13
ognize the citizenship rights of Creek Freedmen and 
14
to deny to Creek Freedmen all rights, privileges,

2
(57) The Creek Treaty of 1866 guarantees the 
3
Creek Freedmen the right to full and equal citizen-
4
ship in the Creek Nation. 
5
(58) The Creek Freedmen are legally indistin-
6
guishable from other citizens of the Creek Nation

pursuant to the Creek Treaty of 1866. 
8
(59) As equal citizens of the Creek Nation, the 
9
Creek Freedmen descendants are entitled to all

from citizenship in the Creek Nation equally and on

20
1866.

the Creek Nation Constitution.

(62) There has been no Act of Congress ex-

pressing any intent to abrogate Article 2 of the

Creek Treaty of 1866. 
5
(63) The Creek Treaty of 1866 is a bilateral 
6
agreement negotiated and signed by two sovereign 
7
entities utilizing their executive and legislative gov-
8
ernmental powers. The validity of the agreement has 
9
not been contested by the Creek Nation. The Treaty 
10
of 1866 is the supreme law of the land regarding the 
11
citizenship rights of Creek Freedmen. 
12
(64) The Department of the Interior is obli-
13
gated to protect the Creek Freedmen descendants 
14
and to refuse to recognize the Creek Nation’s gov-
15
ernment until such time as the Creek Nation affirms 
16
and restores Creek Freedmen citizenship rights. By 
17
continuing to recognize the Creek Nation and its 
18
government, elected and formed under the illegal 
19
1979 Constitution, the Department of the Interior 
20
has violated and continues to violate its own prece-
21
dent and policy, and has breached and continues to 
22
breach its responsibility to the Freedmen descend-
23
ants pursuant to Article 2 of the Treaty of 1866.
