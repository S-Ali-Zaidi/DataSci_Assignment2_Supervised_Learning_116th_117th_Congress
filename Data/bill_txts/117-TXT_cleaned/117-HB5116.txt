(A) The National Navy UDT–SEAL Mu-
10
seum is the only museum dedicated solely to 
11
preserving the history of the United States 
12
Navy SEALs and their predecessors. Located in 
13
Fort Pierce, Florida, the Museum resides on 
14
the training grounds of the original Navy com-
15
bat divers, the Frogmen. 
16

17
fortitude and dedication, the Museum first 
18
opened its doors on Veterans Day in 1985. 
19
From humble beginnings, the facility has expe-
20
rienced tremendous growth, achieving national 
21
stature in 2007.

23
mains the promotion of public education by pro-

(A) The names inscribed on the black 
6
granite walls of the Navy SEAL Memorial, 
7
which is located on Museum grounds, honor 
8
every Frogman who has died in combat or in

15
Frogmen who have fallen the previous year are

17
their loved ones by reading the name as it is

19

the fallen. Sand is collected from around the 
21
world where Frogmen have fought and died and 
22
