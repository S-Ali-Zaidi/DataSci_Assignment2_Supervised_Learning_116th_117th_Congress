SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
The Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Community violence is a significant public 
8
health, public safety, and community infrastructure 
9
concern nationwide and is a leading cause of death, 
10
injury, and trauma for people in the United States 
11
that disrupts employment and hinders a commu-
12
nity’s social and economic development. 
13
(2) From 2010 to 2019, over 175,000 people 
14
were murdered in the United States. Hundreds of 
15
thousands more were hospitalized or treated in 
16
emergency departments after surviving life-changing 
17
gunshot injuries and other violent assaults.

•HR 4118 IH
(3) In 2020, the Nation suffered the largest 
1
single-year spike in homicides on record, driven 
2
largely by record spikes in fatal shootings. Nation-
3
wide, 75 percent of all homicides are committed with 
4
a gun. 
5
(4) Communities across the Nation experience 
6
enormous disparities in safety that are driven by in-
7
equitable social and structural determinants of 
8
health. Interpersonal shootings are disproportion-
9
ately concentrated in neighborhoods harmed by past 
10
and present racial discrimination, segregation, red-
11
lining, disinvestment, mass incarceration, and con-
12
centrated poverty, and this violence’s toll falls over-
13
whelmingly on people of color, especially young 
14
Black and brown men and boys and their loved ones. 
15
From 2015 to 2019, Black children and teens were 
16
14 times as likely to be shot to death as their White 
17
peers. Hispanic children and teens and Native Amer-
18
ican children and teens were both about 3 times as 
19
likely to be shot to death as their White peers. Over 
20
this period, 72 percent of children murdered before 
21
their 18th birthday were people of color, and 50 per-
22
cent were Black. 
23
(5) Black boys and men make up less than 7 
24
percent of the population in the United States, but 
25
03:16 Jul 10, 2021
H4118

•HR 4118 IH
account for more than 50 percent of all gun homi-
1
cide victims each year. Violence is responsible for 
2
nearly half of all deaths among Black boys and 
3
young men, ages 15 through 24, meaning the par-
4
ents of a Black son in this age group are as likely 
5
to lose their child to homicide as nearly every other 
6
cause of death combined. 
7
(6) This violence imposes enormous human, so-
8
cial, and economic costs. The Director of the Cen-
9
ters for Disease Control and Prevention’s Division of 
10
Violence Prevention presented research to Congress 
11
demonstrating that ‘‘youth living in inner cities show 
12
a higher prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder 
13
than soldiers’’ in the Nation’s wartime military. 
14
While the vast majority of these young people resil-
15
iently persevere, people who have been victims of vio-
16
lence are at substantially higher risk of being vio-
17
lently re-attacked or killed. Additionally, both direct 
18
and indirect violence exposure have been associated 
19
with a host of poor health outcomes, including 
20
chronic illness, anxiety, depression, and substance 
21
misuse. 
22
(7) When properly implemented and consist-
23
ently funded, coordinated, community-based strate-
24
gies that utilize trauma-responsive care and inter-
25
03:16 Jul 10, 2021
H4118

•HR 4118 IH
rupt cycles of violence can produce lifesaving and 
1
cost-saving results in a short period of time without 
2
contributing to mass incarceration. These strategies 
3
identify those at the highest risk, coordinate individ-
4
ualized wraparound resources, provide pathways to 
5
healing and stability, and monitor and support long- 
6
term success. Many cities have substantially reduced 
7
community violence in recent years by implementing 
8
various combinations of these strategies, which in-
9
clude the following: 
10
(A) Community outreach programs, which 
11
hire violence intervention and prevention spe-
12
cialists who have established relationships, re-
13
latable lived experiences, and credibility with in-
14
dividuals in their communities at high risk of 
15
violence and connect them with intensive coun-
16
seling, mediation, peer support, and social serv-
17
ices in order to reduce their risk. Evaluations 
18
have found that these programs, particularly 
19
when integrated into wider networks of sup-
20
portive services, are frequently associated with 
21
significant reductions in gun violence. 
22
(B) Hospital-based violence intervention 
23
programs (referred to in this section as 
24
‘‘HVIP’’), which work to break cycles of vio-
25
03:16 Jul 10, 2021
H4118

•HR 4118 IH
lence by leveraging credible violence interven-
1
tion and prevention specialists to provide inten-
2
sive counseling, peer support, case management, 
3
mediation, and social services to patients recov-
4
ering from gunshot wounds and other violent 
5
injuries. Research has shown that violently in-
6
jured patients are at high risk of retaliating 
7
with violence themselves or being revictimized 
8
by violence in the near future. Evaluations of 
9
HVIPs have found that patients who received 
10
HVIP services were often less likely to be con-
11
victed of a violent crime and less likely to be 
12
subsequently reinjured by violence than patients 
13
who did not receive HVIP services. 
14
(C) Group violence interventions provide 
15
tailored social services and support to group-in-
16
volved individuals at highest risk for involve-
17
ment in community violence. This intervention, 
18
which must be trauma informed, culturally re-
19
sponsive, and community driven to be most suc-
20
cessful, includes a process for community mem-
21
bers to voice a clear demand for the violence to 
22
stop and narrowly focused enforcement actions 
23
against those who continue to engage in acts of 
24
serious violence. The approach coordinates law 
25

•HR 4118 IH
enforcement, service providers, and community 
1
engagement efforts to reduce violence in ways 
2
that do not contribute to mass incarceration. 
3
(D) Violence interruption and crisis man-
4
agement, which respond to potentially violent 
5
incidents to mediate conflicts or to scenes where 
6
violence has occurred to offer trauma-informed 
7
services and community supports to survivors 
8
and others exposed to violence. These strategies 
9
help to prevent retaliatory violence and promote 
10
healing and well-being. Programs that include 
11
these components have reported deescalating 
12
dozens of disputes that were highly likely to end 
13
in lethal violence. 
14
(8) Access to job and entrepreneurship training, 
15
apprenticeship, and technological and digital literacy 
16
programs are effective tools in reducing community 
17
violence. A 2012 University of Pennsylvania study of 
18
13 high-violence schools in the Chicago area found 
19
‘‘well-targeted, low-cost employment policies can 
20
make a substantial difference’’, and the city’s most 
21
violent neighborhoods saw a 43 percent drop in vio-
22
lent-crime arrests of participants in a youth job pro-
23
gram.

(9) Individualized wraparound services and op-
1
portunities include, but are not limited to, housing 
2
support, financial assistance, reentry services, legal 
3
assistance, therapeutic services, grief counseling or 
4
targeted victim services, and skill building based on 
5
the needs of survivors or individuals at the highest 
6
risk of community violence. Leveraging the relation-
7
ships of violence intervention and prevention special-
8
ists, these services are used in the context of struc-
9
tured, person-centered peer mentorship that facili-
10
tates personal transformation by meeting people 
11
where they are and offering to help participants 
12
change the trajectories of their lives. 
13
(10) The past year has had a disproportionate 
14
impact on youth unemployment, with 2.9 million 
15
more unemployed youth in mid-2020 compared with 
16
pre-2020 levels. Simultaneously, the 2020 recession 
17
accelerated an already increasingly digital and auto-
18
mated workforce, and youth must attain the digital, 
19
technological, and other technical skills necessary to 
20
thrive in the future of work. While jobs in the cus-
21
tomer service and food industry could fall by 4.3 
22
million between 2018 and 2030, health care and 
23
STEM occupations could grow more now than ever.

(11) Intentional and sustained investments in 
1
community-based violence reduction strategies can

reverse recent increases in homicides, help to heal 
3
impacted communities, and reduce the enormous 
4
human and economic costs of community violence,
