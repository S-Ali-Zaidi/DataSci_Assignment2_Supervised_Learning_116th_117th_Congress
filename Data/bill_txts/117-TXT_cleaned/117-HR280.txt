RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
decades of policies rooted in socialism have stifled United 
States domestic pharmaceutical drug manufacturing and 
left the United States exposed to the hostile actions 
and unfair trade practices of the People’s Republic of 
China. 
Whereas until the recent enactment of the Tax Cuts and 
Jobs Act, the United States had one of the least competi-
tive tax systems in the world, causing decades of manu-

facturing job losses and increased offshoring of vital in-
dustries; 
Whereas the over $2,000,000,000,000 of annual economic 
output lost due to the cost imposed by Federal regulatory 
action would, by itself, be the 15th largest economy; 
Whereas the crushing $28,000,000,000,000 Federal debt has 
drained United States credit markets, starving Americans 
and American businesses of needed funding to expand 
operations and modernize factories; 
Whereas the left has, for decades, sought to expand these 
burdens and barriers of the Federal Government to pro-
mote its radical agenda, depleting America of its indus-
trial base; 
Whereas the pharmaceutical industry has been particularly 
affected by the negative effects of these anticompetitive 
socialist policies, driving up prices and forcing private in-
dustry to offshore manufacturing processes; 
Whereas the novel coronavirus (COVID–19) outbreak com-
pounded national security and public health concerns and 
highlighted potential vulnerabilities regarding the Amer-
ican health care system’s reliance on foreign nations, par-
ticularly China, for medical supplies and pharmaceuticals; 
Whereas the Communist Chinese regime has sought to take 
advantage of these burdens and use its own tariffs, sub-
sidies, and anticompetitive policies to gain a comparative 
advantage in the manufacturing of active pharmaceutical 
ingredients; 
Whereas, in September 2018, the Department of Defense 
published a study titled ‘‘Assessing and Strengthening 
the Manufacturing and Defense Industrial Base and Sup-
ply Chain Resiliency of the United States’’, which identi-

fied several national security risks associated with Chi-
na’s anticompetitive, protectionist trade policies; 
Whereas the 2018 National Defense Strategy clearly states 
that the central challenge to the prosperity, security, and 
success of the United States is China’s authoritarian 
model and long-term strategic competition; 
Whereas China is also leveraging military modernization and 
predatory economics to reorder the Indo-Pacific region to 
its advantage and to displace the United States in its ef-
forts for global dominance; 
Whereas, in October 2019, the Food and Drug Administra-
tion testified that China has increased production of ac-
tive pharmaceutical ingredients over the past decade, 
driven by industry desire for cost-savings and less strin-
gent regulatory structures; 
Whereas in that testimony, the Food and Drug Administra-
tion noted that current data capabilities leave gaps in un-
derstanding the exact volume of foreign-sourced active 
pharmaceutical ingredients being used for domestic 
drugs, the volume being produced at Chinese facilities, 
and where Chinese active pharmaceutical ingredients are 
being distributed worldwide; 
Whereas China intends to continue using United States self- 
imposed economic constraints to push the United States 
out of global affairs and to dismantle the free market 
structures that have lead to unprecedented global pros-
perity; 
Whereas the threat imposed by China is dependent on the 
United States continuing decades of domestic policies 
that have stifled development and crippled the United 
States manufacturing base; and

Whereas the people and industries of the United States pos-
sess the skillsets, tools, and innovative spirit to restore

be it

(3) urges the United States Government to—
