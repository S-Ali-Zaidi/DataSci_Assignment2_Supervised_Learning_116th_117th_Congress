A BILL 
To amend title 18, United States Code, to specify lynching 
as a deprivation of civil rights, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Emmett Till and Will 
4
Brown Justice for Victims of Lynching Act of 2021’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) The crime of lynching succeeded slavery as 
8
the ultimate expression of racism in the United 
9
States following Reconstruction.

(2) Lynching was a widely acknowledged prac-
1
tice in the United States until the middle of the 
2
20th century. 
3
(3) Lynching was a crime that occurred 
4
throughout the United States, with documented inci-
5
dents in all but 4 States. 
6
(4) At least 4,742 people, predominantly Afri-
7
can Americans, were reported lynched in the United 
8
States between 1882 and 1968. 
9
(5) Ninety-nine percent of all perpetrators of 
10
lynching escaped from punishment by State or local 
11
officials. 
12
(6) Lynching prompted African Americans to 
13
form the National Association for the Advancement 
14
of Colored People (referred to in this section as the 
15
‘‘NAACP’’) and prompted members of B’nai B’rith 
16
to found the Anti-Defamation League. 
17
(7) Mr. Walter White, as a member of the 
18
NAACP and later as the executive secretary of the 
19
NAACP from 1931 to 1955, meticulously inves-
20
tigated lynchings in the United States and worked 
21
tirelessly to end segregation and racialized terror. 
22
(8) Nearly 200 anti-lynching bills were intro-
23
duced in Congress during the first half of the 20th 
24
century.

(9) Between 1890 and 1952, 7 Presidents peti-
1
tioned Congress to end lynching. 
2
(10) Between 1920 and 1940, the House of 
3
Representatives passed 3 strong anti-lynching meas-
4
ures. 
5
(11) Protection against lynching was the min-
6
imum and most basic of Federal responsibilities, and 
7
the Senate considered but failed to enact anti-lynch-
8
ing legislation despite repeated requests by civil 
9
rights groups, Presidents, and the House of Rep-
10
resentatives to do so. 
11
(12) The publication of ‘‘Without Sanctuary: 
12
Lynching Photography in America’’ helped bring 
13
greater awareness and proper recognition of the vic-
14
tims of lynching. 
15
(13) Only by coming to terms with history can 
16
the United States effectively champion human rights 
17
abroad. 
18
(14) An apology offered in the spirit of true re-
19
pentance moves the United States toward reconcili-
20
ation and may become central to a new under-
21
standing, on which improved racial relations can be 
22
forged. 
23
(15) Having concluded that a reckoning with 
24
our own history is the only way the country can ef-
25

fectively champion human rights abroad, 90 Mem-
1
bers of the United States Senate agreed to Senate 
2
Resolution 39, 109th Congress, on June 13, 2005, 
3
to apologize to the victims of lynching and the de-
4
scendants of those victims for the failure of the Sen-
5
ate to enact anti-lynching legislation. 
6
(16) The National Memorial for Peace and Jus-
7
tice, which opened to the public in Montgomery, Ala-
8
bama, on April 26, 2018, is the Nation’s first memo-
9
rial dedicated to the legacy of enslaved Black people, 
10
people terrorized by lynching, African Americans hu-
11
miliated by racial segregation and Jim Crow, and 
12
people of color burdened with contemporary pre-
13
sumptions of guilt and police violence. 
14
(17) Notwithstanding the Senate’s apology and 
15
the heightened awareness and education about the 
16
Nation’s legacy with lynching, it is wholly necessary 
17
and appropriate for the Congress to enact legisla-
18
tion, after 100 years of unsuccessful legislative ef-
19
forts, finally to make lynching a Federal crime. 
20
(18) Further, it is the sense of Congress that 
21
criminal action by a group increases the likelihood 
22
that the criminal object of that group will be suc-
23
cessfully attained and decreases the probability that 
24
the individuals involved will depart from their path 
25

of criminality. Therefore, it is appropriate to specify 
1
criminal penalties for the crime of lynching, or any 
2
attempt or conspiracy to commit lynching. 
3
(19) The United States Senate agreed to unani-
4
mously Senate Resolution 118, 115th Congress, on 
5
April 5, 2017, ‘‘[c]ondemning hate crime and any 
6
other form of racism, religious or ethnic bias, dis-
7
crimination, incitement to violence, or animus tar-
8
geting a minority in the United States’’ and taking 
9
notice specifically of Federal Bureau of Investigation 
10
statistics demonstrating that ‘‘among single-bias 
11
hate crime incidents in the United States, 59.2 per-
12
cent of victims were targeted due to racial, ethnic, 
13
or ancestral bias, and among those victims, 52.2 
14
percent were victims of crimes motivated by the of-
15
fenders’ anti-Black or anti-African American bias’’. 
16
(20) On September 14, 2017, President Donald 
17
J. Trump signed into law Senate Joint Resolution 
18
49 (Public Law 115–58; 131 Stat. 1149), wherein 
19
Congress ‘‘condemn[ed] the racist violence and do-
20
mestic terrorist attack that took place between Au-
21
gust 11 and August 12, 2017, in Charlottesville, 
22
Virginia’’ and ‘‘urg[ed] the President and his admin-
23
istration to speak out against hate groups that 
24

tism, and White supremacy; and use all resources 
1
available to the President and the President’s Cabi-
2
net to address the growing prevalence of those hate 
3
groups in the United States’’. 
4
(21) Senate Joint Resolution 49 (Public Law 
5
115–58; 131 Stat. 1149) specifically took notice of 
6
‘‘hundreds of torch-bearing White nationalists, 
7
White supremacists, Klansmen, and neo-Nazis [who] 
8
chanted racist, anti-Semitic, and anti-immigrant slo-
9
gans and violently engaged with counter-demonstra-
10
tors on and around the grounds of the University of 
11
Virginia in Charlottesville’’ and that these groups 
12
‘‘reportedly are organizing similar events in other 
13
cities in the United States and communities every-
14
where are concerned about the growing and open 
15
display of hate and violence being perpetrated by 
16
those groups’’. 
17
(22) Lynching was a pernicious and pervasive 
18
tool that was used to interfere with multiple aspects 
19
of life—including the exercise of federally protected 
20
rights, as enumerated in section 245 of title 18, 
21
United States Code, housing rights, as enumerated 
22
in section 901 of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 (42 
23
U.S.C. 3631), and the free exercise of religion, as 
24
enumerated in section 247 of title 18, United States 
25

Code. Interference with these rights was often effec-
1
tuated by multiple offenders and groups, rather than 
2
isolated individuals. Therefore, prohibiting conspir-
3
acies to violate each of these rights recognizes the 
4
history of lynching in the United States and serves 
5
to prohibit its use in the future.

the Civil Rights Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3631) shall be
