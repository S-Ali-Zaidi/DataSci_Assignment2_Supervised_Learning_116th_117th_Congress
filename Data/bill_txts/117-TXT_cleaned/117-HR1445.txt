RESOLUTION 
Recognizing that the irresponsible withdrawal of petroleum 
products from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is a 
threat to the security of the United States. 
Whereas the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 
was enacted on December 22, 1975, creating the Stra-
tegic Petroleum Reserve to respond to the global oil cri-
sis; 
Whereas the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is divided into four 
sites, Bryan Mound, Big Hill, West Hackberry, and

Bayou Choctaw, near the Gulf of Mexico, with an author-
ized total storage capacity of 714 million barrels of oil; 
Whereas the President has the sole control over the draw-
down and sale of petroleum products from the Strategic 
Petroleum Reserve; 
Whereas there have only been three emergency drawdowns 
from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in its history— 
during Operation Desert Storm in 1991, during the 
aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and, in coordi-
nation with the International Energy Agency, responding 
to instability in the Middle East and North Africa in 
2011; 
Whereas President Biden’s administration, since day one, has 
irresponsibly attacked the energy sector of the United 
States, halting the construction of the Keystone XL pipe-
line, creating bureaucratic challenges to the permitting 
process, and promoting the exclusive use of wind and 
solar energy (sources that are not entirely reliable), mak-
ing the United States dependent on foreign powers; 
Whereas, on March 31, 2022, President Biden announced the 
release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve of one mil-
lion barrels of crude oil per day for six months to sta-
bilize volatile energy costs; 
Whereas, on July 26, 2022, President Biden authorized the 
sale of an additional 20 million barrels of oil from the 
Strategic Petroleum Reserve to other countries, including 
China; 
Whereas, on September 30, 2022, the Strategic Petroleum 
Reserve held only 416.4 million barrels of oil, the lowest 
level since December 1985, significantly affecting the

ability of the United States to respond to natural disas-
ters or an attack on the United States; and 
Whereas President Biden’s release of oil from the Strategic 
Petroleum Reserve to artificially lower gas prices at the 
expense of the national security of the United States is 
motivated by political, rather than economic or security, 
reasons: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) recognizes energy security is national secu-
2
rity; 
3
(2) recognizes that President Biden’s attack on 
4
domestic production of oil and gas has resulted in 
5
the United States being energy dependent; 
6
(3) encourages higher levels of domestic oil and 
7
gas production as Americans produce energy more 
8
cleanly and more efficiently than any other country; 
9
and 
10
(4) calls upon President Biden to halt the sale 
11
of petroleum products from the Strategic Petroleum 
12
Reserve and to begin replenishing the Strategic Pe-
13
troleum Reserve.
