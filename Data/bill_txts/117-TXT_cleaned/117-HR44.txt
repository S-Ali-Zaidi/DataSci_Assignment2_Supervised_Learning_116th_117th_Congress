tigation into President Donald J. Trump for his involve-
ment in and incitement of the violent attacks at the

against the authority of the United States; 
Whereas in his address to the crowd that led to the attack 
on the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021, Presi-
dent Trump stated, ‘‘We’re gathered together in the

you’re not going to have a country anymore . . . so we’re 
going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue and we’re going 
to the Capitol.’’;

olence applies to ‘‘Whoever, with intent that another per-

another in violation of the laws of the United States, and

dressed, constitutes a rebellion or insurrection against 
the authority of the United States; 
Whereas the attack on the United States Capitol on January

dressed, constitutes seditious conspiracy under section 
2384 of title 18, United States Code, according to the

2020, which states, ‘‘Section 2384 does not require proof 
of a plot to overthrow the U.S. Government . . . it also 
applies to conspiracies with any of the following objects: 
to oppose by force the authority [of the Government of 
the United States]; by force to prevent, hinder, or delay 
the execution of any law of the United States; or by force 
to seize, take, or possess any property of the United 
States contrary to the authority thereof.’’;
