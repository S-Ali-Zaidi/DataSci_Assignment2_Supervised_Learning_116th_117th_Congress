RESOLUTION 
Supporting the designation of Vaisakhi, April 14 of each 
year, as ‘‘National Sikh Day’’. 
Whereas the United States is enriched by the diversity of its 
residents, who have cultivated a climate of social toler-
ance and intellectual pluralism that has sustained the 
Nation throughout its history; 
Whereas the Sikh community, which originated in Punjab, 
India, and began immigrating into the United States over 
100 years ago, has played an important role in devel-
oping the United States; 
Whereas Sikhism is the world’s fifth-largest religion with 
nearly 30,000,000 adherents, roughly 1,000,000 of whom 
call the United States home;

Whereas, founded by Guru Nanak in the Punjab region of 
India during the 15th century, the Sikh spiritual tradi-
tion is rooted in the belief that every person, regardless 
of race, gender, sex, or creed, is equal before God; 
Whereas believing that every person shares a connection 
through the oneness of God, the Sikh community 
emerged as a force for social justice by encouraging fe-
male participation in religious services and initiating 
interfaith efforts to combat oppression and injustice; 
Whereas the Sikh religion’s central principles of truthful liv-
ing, service to humanity, and devotion to God also inspire 
its believers to create inclusive communities where all are 
respected; 
Whereas through leading charitable events, the Sikh commu-
nity embodies the sense of public service that underlies 
the founding principles of the United States; 
Whereas the people of the United States feel obliged to honor 
the Sikh community’s important role in supporting and 
enriching the social fabric of the Nation; 
Whereas Sikhs celebrate Vaisakhi on the first day of the 
month of Vaisakh in the Sikh calendar, which typically 
falls on April 14; 
Whereas Vaisakhi is a special occasion in which Sikhs re-
member the founding in 1699 of the Order of Khalsa, a 
fellowship of devout saint-soldier Sikhs, by the 10th Sikh 
Guru to fight tyranny and oppression, which played an 
important role in shaping the religion’s history and iden-
tity; and 
Whereas it is altogether fitting and proper to celebrate the 
day of Vaisakhi alongside Sikhs throughout the world
