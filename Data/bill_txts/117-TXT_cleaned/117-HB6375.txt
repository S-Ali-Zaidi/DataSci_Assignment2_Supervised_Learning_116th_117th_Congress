Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

(a) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds the following:

•HR 6375 IH
(1) The President’s Task Force on 21st Cen-
1
tury Policing highlighted the importance of hiring 
2
law enforcement officers who reflect the diversity 
3
and values of the community, and who have both the 
4
mindset and the skills needed to engage with the 
5
community. 
6
(2) Diverse workforces can be more effective, 
7
creative, and resilient than homogenous workforces, 
8
and teams with broader perspectives result in better 
9
decision-making and problem-solving practices. Re-
10
cruiting a diverse pool of candidates includes quali-
11
fied individuals from different races, genders, 
12
ethnicities, and cultural backgrounds. 
13
(3) Effective law enforcement recruitment prac-
14
tices can help engender trust, develop good relations 
15
with their communities, and ensure that the officers 
16
they hire can best serve those communities. Recruit-
17
ment efforts should start in the community, and law 
18
enforcement agencies should consider developing 
19
youth programs to attract younger generations. This 
20
could 
include 
Explorer 
programs, 
internships 
21
through local schools, cadet academies, university 
22
partnerships, and youth mentorship programs that 
23
foster relationships between young adults and de-
24
partments. Not only do these programs develop en-

thusiasm for a law enforcement career, they can also 
1
build relationships between law enforcement agencies 
2
and the communities they serve. 
3
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
4
gress that the COPS Office is uniquely suited to empower 
5
local law enforcement agencies to fulfill recommendations 
6
related to law enforcement hiring practices, including 
7
agencies being reflective of the communities they serve, 
8
both demographically and in values and vision, and pos-
9
sessing the mindset and skills needed to engage with the 
10
community.
