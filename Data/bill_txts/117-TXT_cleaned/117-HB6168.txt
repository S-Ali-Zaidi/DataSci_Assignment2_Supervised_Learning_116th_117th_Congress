SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The use of fossil fuels exacerbates the cli-
3
mate crisis, threatens America’s natural resources, 
4
and disproportionately damages frontline environ-
5
mental justice communities. 
6
(2) In order to avoid the worst consequences of 
7
climate change, the Federal Government should 
8
transition away from fossil fuels to renewable energy 
9
sources. 
10
(3) In achieving its energy goals, it is the re-
11
sponsibility of the Federal Government to ensure a 
12
fair and just transition for workers and frontline 
13
communities. 
14
(4) The Federal Government should do this by 
15
prioritizing racial and gender equity, environmental 
16
justice, and partnering with labor unions to ensure 
17
that workers have training for and access to clean- 
18
energy jobs.
