RESOLUTION 
Commemorating the 80th anniversary of the Civil Air Patrol. 
Whereas the Civil Air Patrol (CAP) was founded on Decem-
ber 1, 1941, to supplement civilian defense organizations 
and the United States military during World War II; 
Whereas, in 1946, Congress incorporated CAP as a non-
profit, volunteer civilian organization to encourage and 
aid American citizens in the development of aviation and 
maintenance of air supremacy, foster volunteerism among 
private citizens to the public welfare, and provide aviation 
education and training to adult and youth members; 
Whereas, in 1948, CAP was designated as the civilian auxil-
iary of the United States Air Force, tasked by the Sec-
retary of the Air Force to fulfill noncombatant missions 
on behalf of the service, including humanitarian and 
search and rescue missions;

Whereas, since CAP’s beginning, the organization has re-
sponded in the country’s times of need by deterring 
enemy submarines during World War II, supporting Air 
Force Cold War operations by training to track enemy 
aircraft and conduct aerial radiological monitoring, con-
ducting counterdrug reconnaissance starting in the 
1980s, and assisting government agencies immediately 
following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks; 
Whereas, for all 80 years, CAP has conducted aerial and 
ground search, rescue, and disaster operations for the 
Federal Government, States, and communities including 
thousands of aircraft and missing person searches, and 
among thousands of other national missions, Hurricanes 
Katrina and Sandy, the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, and 
the COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas CAP supports States and local governments through 
working with State agencies and others such as the Coast 
Guard, National Guard, Federal Emergency Management 
Agency, American Red Cross, and community first re-
sponders with thousands of valuable trained personnel 
and assets such as 560 aircraft, over a thousand vehicles, 
high-tech equipment such as advanced aircraft cameras 
and camera-equipped small unmanned aerial vehicles, and 
communications networks in every State with over 10,000 
radios during times of disasters and other emergencies; 
Whereas CAP provides exceptional educational and growth 
opportunities and experiences for youth through its near-
ly 22,000-member-strong cadet program, including week-
ly training and activities in thousands of communities, 
character and leadership training, aerospace education, 
State encampments, emergency services training and op-
portunities, cyber defense competitions, and various flight

orientations and training including powered, glider, and 
unmanned aerial vehicle solo and pilot license training as 
well as through more than 30 special national programs 
emphasizing careers and experiences in aviation and 
space; 
Whereas CAP supports tens of thousands of teachers, stu-
dents, and schools throughout the Nation with special 
teacher support and programs, teacher orientation 
flights, special school programs, science, technology, engi-
neering, and mathematics kits for classrooms, and text-
books and curricula for aerospace education; 
Whereas, since September 11, 2001, CAP continues to pro-
vide vital noncombatant homeland security and defense 
missions that help ensure the protection of the Nation by 
assisting the Air Force and other key agencies with crit-
ical support and training such as providing slow-mover 
targets for air-intercept training; 
Whereas, in 2015, CAP officially became a member of the Air 
Force’s Total Force, joining Active Duty, Reserve, Na-
tional Guard, and civilians as airmen when conducting 
missions for the United States Air Force; 
Whereas CAP responded with a national mobilization effort 
during the COVID–19 pandemic providing air and 
ground team support to States and local communities re-
garding food deliveries, COVID test site support, and test 
kit deliveries and vaccine deliveries, among other mis-
sions, making this the largest mobilization of CAP man-
power and assets since World War II—over 46,500 vol-
unteer man days to date: and 
Whereas every day CAP offers America an all-volunteer force 
of professionally trained citizens who for eight decades
