SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The southwest border of the United States, 
3
particularly near the Rio Grande Valley, has been 
4
inundated by illegal aliens and foreign migrants in 
5
response to lenient immigration and border policies 
6
and practices. 
7
(2) During the first 4 months of fiscal year 
8
2021, U.S. Customs and Border Protection recorded 
9
between 71,946 and 78,414 monthly encounters with 
10
migrants along the southwest border. During the 
11
first 7 full months of the Biden Administration, 
12
such encounters increased to an average of 177,883 
13
per month, resulting in a total of 1,541,651 such en-
14
counters during the first 11 months of fiscal year 
15
2021. 
16
(3) U.S. Customs and Border Protection en-
17
counters have increased during fiscal year 2021 in 
18
each southwest Border Patrol Sector compared to 
19
fiscal year 2020, particularly in the sectors along the 
20
Rio Grande River, where, as of August 2021, there 
21
had been an increase of— 
22
(A) 135.8 percent in the Laredo Sector; 
23
(B) 278.7 percent in the El Paso Sector; 
24
(C) 380.3 percent in the Big Bend Sector; 
25

•HR 5717 IH
(D) 532.6 percent increase in the Del Rio 
1
Sector; and 
2
(E) 542.4 percent increase in the Rio 
3
Grande Valley Sector. 
4
(4) The number of encounters at the southwest 
5
border between U.S. Customs and Border Protection 
6
agents and migrants comprised the vast majority of 
7
total U.S. Customs and Border Protection encoun-
8
ters nationwide during fiscal year 2021. 
9
(5) During September 2021, an estimated 
10
30,000 migrants crossed through the port of entry 
11
at the City of Del Rio, Texas, which is almost as nu-
12
merous as the city’s population. All of these mi-
13
grants had to be processed in accordance with the 
14
Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et 
15
seq.) and section 362 of the Public Health Service 
16
Act (42 U.S.C. 265). As many as 15,000 migrants 
17
gathered and waited to be processed at the Del Rio 
18
port of entry in mid-September, leading to inhumane 
19
conditions for the migrants temporarily housed 
20
under an underpass in makeshift shelters, and seri-
21
ous fears and uncertainty for the local residents. 
22
(6) Several Federal officials have acknowledged 
23
that officials at the Department of Homeland Secu-
24
rity’s Office of Intelligence and Analysis, U.S. Cus-
25

toms and Border Protection, and U.S. Immigration 
1
and Customs Enforcement were aware of the poten-
2
tial surge of migrants from Haiti several months be-
3
fore the surge occurred, but failed to stop the im-
4
pending crisis. Instead of increasing deportations to 
5
discourage a surge of illegal immigration, these 
6
agencies halted all deportation flights to Haiti in the 
7
weeks leading up to the September crisis in Del Rio, 
8
Texas. 
9
(7) Although immigration policy is directed by 
10
the Federal Government, the immediate effects of 
11
such large numbers of encounters are primarily felt 
12
by the States and local communities along the south-
13
west border. These States and local communities 
14
bear direct and indirect costs, and are most im-
15
pacted by the volume of individual encounters at the 
16
border. State and local governments bear substantial 
17
costs to alleviate concerns for citizens and migrants 
18
as a result of inadequate Federal enforcement of ex-
19
isting immigration laws and border enforcement 
20
policies. These costs include health care, schooling, 
21
housing, and public safety expenses related to the 
22
resettlement of new arrivals. 
23
(8) The Governor of Texas originally declared a 
24
disaster in 34 Texas counties based on the increase 
25

•HR 5717 IH
in illegal immigration at the southwest border and 
1
has since expanded the disaster declaration to a 
2
total of 47 Texas counties, including Brewster,

10
Webb, 
Zavala, 
Menard, 
Wharton, 
McCulloch, 
11
Refugio, Victoria, and Wilbarger counties. The gov-
12
ernor has deployed thousands of National Guard and 
13
Department of Public Safety troopers to the border 
14
over the past months in order to enforce existing 
15
Federal immigration laws. However, significant 
16
numbers of additional foreign migrants are still 
17
heading to the southwest border. 
18
(9) The sheer volume of migrant crossings has 
19
overwhelmed the capacity of Border Patrol sectors 
20
along the southwest border. Many U.S. Border Pa-
21
trol agents have been pulled from their duties patrol-
22
ling the border to help process people in custody in 
23
the southwest Border Patrol sectors, leaving parts of 
24
the border insufficiently guarded.
