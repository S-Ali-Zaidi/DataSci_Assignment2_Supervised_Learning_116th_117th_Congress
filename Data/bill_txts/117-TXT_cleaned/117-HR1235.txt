ments, and parks and other public lands, learn about 
conservation efforts in their community, and show their

private events, film screenings, discussions, ground hikes,

enced the effects of climate change;

nants in drinking water are serious threats to the health 
of their families;

likely to die from asthma attacks due to the dispropor-
tionate pollution burdens their communities are exposed 
to;

caused by exposure to poor air quality; 
Whereas access to natural spaces— 
(1) provides mental and physical health benefits; 
(2) can save almost three dollars in health care on 
every dollar spent on creating and maintaining park 
trails; and

air pollution, and can aid economic recovery;

panic Whites to live in urban heat islands, or areas domi-
nated by asphalt and concrete without access to parks 
that provide shade for urban cooling;

identity, and they weave a narrative of the diverse and 
complex history of the Nation;

ments, national wildlife refuges, and Tribal protected 
areas to protect historic sites or areas for outdoor recre-
ation;

gion support the creation of new marine sanctuaries to

Whereas Latinos are the largest minority group in America, 
with over 60,500,000 people making up 18 percent of the 
Nation’s population, and are projected to become nearly 
one-third of the population by 2050; 
Whereas 4,400,000 Latinos participate in fishing, averaging 
more outings per year than the general fishing popu-
lation; 
Whereas all communities should have equitable access to 
nearby green space, the ability to reach it, and features 
that honor and welcome diverse languages, inclusive his-
tories, and uses of parkland; and 
Whereas the third week of July is an appropriate week to 
designate as ‘‘Latino Conservation Week’’: Now, there-
fore, be it

about the environment and feel a moral obligation to

take care of it; and

(3) supports the designation of ‘‘Latino Con-
