RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the designation of June 26 as 
‘‘LGBTQ Equality Day’’. 
Whereas the United States recognizes that all people should 
be treated equally; 
Whereas Members of the 117th Congress support the rights 
and freedoms of individuals who are lesbian, gay, bisex-
ual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ); 
Whereas, on June 26, 2003, the United States Supreme 
Court ruled in Lawrence v. Texas that States could no 
longer criminalize the private conduct in which same-sex 
couples engage; 
Whereas, on June 26, 2013, the United States Supreme 
Court ruled in United States v. Windsor that section 3 
of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) was unconstitu-
tional and the Federal Government could no longer re-
strict married same-sex couples from receiving Federal 
benefits and protections; 
Whereas, on June 26, 2015, the United States Supreme 
Court ruled in Obergefell v. Hodges that same-sex cou-
ples have a constitutional right to marry and States could 
no longer discriminate against same-sex couples when 
recognizing or licensing a marriage; 
Whereas Supreme Court decisions handed down on June 26 
ended marriage discrimination and the criminalization of 
same-sex private intimate conduct under the law; 
Whereas LGBTQ people and their allies have worked to-
gether for over 60 years to make progress toward achiev-
ing full equality for all people in the United States, re-
gardless of sexual orientation or gender identity;

Whereas LGBTQ people in the United States continue to 
face many barriers to the American dream that cannot 
be solved through courtroom litigation alone; 
Whereas transgender people and LGBTQ people of color are 
disproportionately and uniquely burdened by such bar-
riers, including violence, discrimination, poverty, and so-
cietal isolation; 
Whereas although victories at the Supreme Court have af-
firmed the dignity and equality of millions of same-sex 
couples, statutory reforms are needed to ensure LGBTQ 
people in the United States are free from discrimination 
and have equal access to the American dream; and 
Whereas June 26 would be an appropriate date to designate 
as ‘‘LGBTQ Equality Day’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports equal rights and protections for all 
2
people, regardless of actual or perceived sexual ori-
3
entation or gender identity; 
4
(2) supports the designation of ‘‘LGBTQ 
5
Equality Day’’; 
6
(3) encourages the celebration of ‘‘LGBTQ 
7
Equality Day’’ to commemorate the significance of 
8
Supreme Court decisions handed down on June 26 
9
in 2003, 2013, and 2015, and to continue educating 
10
all people about the forms of discrimination, harass-
11
ment, and intolerance that lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
12
and transgender people continue to face; and
