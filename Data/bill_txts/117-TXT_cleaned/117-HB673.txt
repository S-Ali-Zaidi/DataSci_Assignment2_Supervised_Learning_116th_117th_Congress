SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

(2) When Johnson discovered that the South 
1
Side of Chicago had the highest cancer rate of any 
2
area in Chicago, she was inspired to investigate the 
3
cancer rates, foul odors, and number of children 
4
with respiratory illnesses in her own neighborhood, 
5
the community of Altgeld Gardens on the South 
6
Side of Chicago. 
7
(3) Johnson discovered her community, Altgeld 
8
Gardens, which is a public housing project, was built 
9
on a landfill surrounded by toxicity, which polluted 
10
the air, water, and land. 
11
(4) Additionally, the Altgeld Gardens homes 
12
had asbestos and elevated lead levels. 
13
(5) This discovery inspired Johnson to create 
14
the People for Community Recovery, an organization 
15
which fights for a safer environment. 
16
(6) Johnson and the People for Community Re-
17
covery fought to educate and empower the residents 
18
of Altgeld Gardens, including providing workshops 
19
and trainings, conducting health surveys, rallying 
20
residents to protest contamination, and working with 
21
youth in the community. 
22
(7) The People for Community Recovery put 
23
pressure on the Chicago Housing Authority to re-
24
move asbestos from Altgeld Gardens.

(8) Johnson’s fight for clean water led to the 
1
installation of water and sewer lines by city health 
2
officials in the far South Side neighborhood of Mary-
3
land Manor, where the existing well water was con-
4
taminated with cyanide and other toxins. 
5
(9) Johnson used her vigilance and activism to 
6
give low-income minority communities a voice and a 
7
stake in the environmental justice fight by bringing 
8
the conversation to personal, immediate, and urgent 
9
concerns which directly impact communities inhab-
10
ited by people of color. 
11
(10) Johnson also strove to hold both busi-
12
nesses and the government responsible for how their 
13
actions impact the environment. 
14
(11) Johnson was given the 1992 President’s 
15
Environment and Conservation Challenge Award in 
16
recognition of her environmental justice work. 
17
(12) Notably, Johnson was instrumental in 
18
pressuring President Bill Clinton to sign the Envi-
19
ronmental Justice Executive Order, which holds the 
20
Federal Government accountable for urban commu-
21
nities exposed to pollution. 
22
(13) In 2004, sociologist David Naguib Pellow 
23
credited Johnson and the People for Community Re-
24
covery with putting ‘‘the South Side of Chicago on

the radar screen for activists and policy makers 
1
around the United States who are concerned about 
2
environmental racism’’. 
3
(14) On January 12, 2011, the Illinois General 
4
Assembly, by way of a House Joint Resolution, des-
5
ignated ‘‘the portion of 130th Street from the 
6
Bishop Ford Freeway to State Street in Chicago as 
7
the ‘Hazel Johnson EJ Way’ ’’. 
8
(15) Johnson was a visionary, who was able to 
9
foresee the impacts of failing to address environ-
10
mental and social justice conditions. 
11
(16) Johnson’s work earned her the title of 
12
‘‘mother of the environmental justice movement’’.
