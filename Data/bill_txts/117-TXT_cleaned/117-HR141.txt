Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
Congress must completely and unequivocally condemn 
violence, lawlessness, and rioting from all individuals and 
groups, regardless of ideology or political affiliation. 
Whereas, in 2020 and 2021 in cities throughout the United 
States, over 9,000 demonstrations, many of them violent 
and destructive, some amounting to domestic terrorism, 
took place, injuring hundreds and claiming more than 30 
American lives, inflicting over $1,000,000,000 in dam-
ages and stolen goods, destroying Federal buildings and 
property, and displaying a willful disregard for the rule 
of law: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
