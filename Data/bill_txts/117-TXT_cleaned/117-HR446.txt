Whereas every year, approximately 795,000 people in the 
United States have a stroke; 
Whereas 
the 
direct 
(medical) 
costs 
of 
stroke 
are 
$30,800,000,000 annually, and total costs (both medical 
and lost productivity) are $49,800,000,000; 
Whereas stroke is a leading cause of serious long-term dis-
ability; 
Whereas those disabilities may require ongoing physical, oc-
cupational, speech-language, and other therapy and sur-
geries; 
Whereas the permanent health concerns and treatments re-
sulting from stroke have a considerable impact on chil-
dren, families, and society; 
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ad-
vises that the most effective stroke treatments are avail-
able only if the stroke is recognized and diagnosed within 
3 hours of the first symptoms and recommends the public 
be familiar with and use the mnemonic F.A.S.T. to iden-
tify the signs and symptoms of stroke, including— 
(1) F—Face Drooping: ‘‘Ask the person to smile. 
Does one side of the face droop?’’; 
(2) A—Arm Weakness: ‘‘Ask the person to raise 
both arms. Does one arm drift downward?’’; 
(3) S—Speech Difficulty: ‘‘Ask the person to repeat 
a simple phrase. Is the speech slurred or strange?’’; and 
(4) T—Time to Call 9–1–1: ‘‘If you see any of these 
signs, call 9–1–1 right away.’’; and 
Whereas May is recognized as National Stroke Awareness 
Month: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
