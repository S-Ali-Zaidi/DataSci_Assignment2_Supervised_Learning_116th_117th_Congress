RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the designation of June 1, 2021, 
as ‘‘Batten Disease Awareness Day’’. 
Whereas Batten disease is a family of rare genetic disorders 
of the nervous system that typically begins in childhood; 
Whereas there are many forms of Batten disease, and the 
mutations of at least 14 different genes are known to 
cause the disease; 
Whereas symptoms of the fatal disease include vision loss 
leading to blindness, personality and behavioral changes, 
seizures, intellectual decline, disruption and loss of 
speech, dementia, and other debilitating ailments; 
Whereas depending on the age of onset, Batten disease usu-
ally leads to premature death when the patient is in his 
or her late teens or early twenties;

•HRES 424 IH 
Whereas Batten disease occurs in an estimated 2 to 4 of 
every 100,000 births in the United States; 
Whereas due to the many different forms of the disease, 
there is significant variability in the age of onset and 
symptom progression for each case; 
Whereas on average, the process to reach the correct diag-
nosis for a patient with a rare disease could take up to 
7.6 years, visits with numerous physicians, and multiple 
misdiagnoses; 
Whereas there is no known cure for Batten disease, and the 
lack of essential funding has hindered scientists’ ability 
to find a potential treatment or cure; and 
Whereas the Federal Government has not done enough to 
provide funding for rare diseases, and 95 percent of the 
7,000 rare diseases still have no FDA-approved treat-
ment: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the designation of a ‘‘Batten Dis-
2
ease Awareness Day’’; and 
3
(2) calls for more funding for research to be 
4
done on potential treatment and cures for rare dis-
5
eases.
