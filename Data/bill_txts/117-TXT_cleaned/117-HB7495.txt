A BILL 
To designate the Civil War Defenses of Washington National 
Historical Park comprised of certain National Park Sys-
tem lands, and by affiliation and cooperative agreements 
other historically significant resources, located in the Dis-
trict of Columbia, Virginia, and Maryland, that were 
part of the Civil War defenses of Washington and related 
to the Shenandoah Valley Campaign of 1864, to study 
ways in which the Civil War history of both the North 
and South can be assembled, arrayed, and conveyed for 
the benefit of the public, and for other purposes.

(a) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds and declares as 
10
follows: 
11
(1) It is fitting and helpful for Americans to re-
12
member the Civil War, 1861–1865, and to reflect 
13
upon, and learn from, the storied history, valor, 
14
heartbreak, and suffering of both sides in this tragic 
15
war that so divided and scarred the young Nation, 
16
but that also served as a crucible for the Nation to 
17
secure itself as the United States and preserve the 
18
Union, abolish the injustice of slavery, and become 
19
the beacon of hope as a democracy that it has be-
20
come for the world.

(2) The significance of the Civil War to the fu-
1
ture of the United States is incalculable. The war’s 
2
lessons and meaning to the history of the United 
3
States, what it stands for, and its place in the world 
4
today must be remembered and conveyed to future 
5
generations. The war pitted family against family, 
6
brother against brother, friend against friend, Blue 
7
against Gray. Its battlegrounds were consecrated 
8
with blood that was shed by many who gave their 
9
last full measure of devotion. The reunited democ-
10
racy that emerged, after such a heavy loss of life on 
11
both sides and the difficult decades of healing that 
12
followed, made the United States stronger. It helped 
13
the Nation advance toward achieving the inalienable 
14
rights and noble goals and values its founders 
15
sought, but had not fully achieved, in their lifetimes. 
16
(3) The defenses of Washington played a key 
17
role in the outcome of the Civil War. They were con-
18
structed at the beginning of the war in 1861 as a 
19
ring of fortifications in the District of Columbia, 
20
Maryland, and northern Virginia, to protect the Na-
21
tion’s capital. By the end of the war, these defenses 
22
included 68 forts, 93 unarmed batteries, 807 mount-
23
ed cannon, 13 miles of rifle trenches, and 32 miles 
24
of military roads.

(4) The major test of the Civil War defenses of 
1
Washington came with the Shenandoah Valley Cam-
2
paign of 1864 when Confederate Lieutenant General 
3
Jubal Early marched from Richmond to Lynchburg, 
4
Virginia, and through the Shenandoah Valley to 
5
Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, and Frederick, Mary-
6
land. His major objective, as directed to him by 
7
General Robert E. Lee, was to attack the Nation’s 
8
capital from the north, causing Union Forces to be 
9
withdrawn from threatening Richmond, the capital 
10
of the Confederacy. He was delayed by Union Major 
11
General Lew Wallace at the Battle of Monocacy on 
12
July 9, 1864, and was stopped at the northern edge 
13
of the District of Columbia at the Battle of Fort 
14
Stevens on July 11–12, 1864. The Shenandoah Val-
15
ley Campaign ended when Union Lieutenant General 
16
Philip Sheridan defeated General Early at the Battle 
17
of Cedar Creek, Virginia, on October 19, 1864. 
18
(5) The Battle of Fort Stevens was the second 
19
and last attempt by the Confederate Army to attack 
20
Washington. The first major effort to surround or 
21
capture the Nation’s capital ended at Gettysburg in 
22
July 1863. After that historic battle, in his address 
23
at Gettysburg Cemetery on November 19, 1863, 
24
President Abraham Lincoln redefined what was at 
25
02:59 Apr 14, 2022
H7495
5 
•HR 7495 IH
stake: ‘‘a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedi-
1
cated to the proposition that all men are created 
2
equal . . . that this nation, under God, shall have 
3
a new birth of freedom—and that government of the 
4
people, by the people, and for the people shall not 
5
perish from the earth.’’. 
6
(6) The Battle of Fort Stevens was the only 
7
verifiable time that a sitting United States President 
8
(Abraham Lincoln) came under hostile fire during a 
9
battle while in office. Nearly all the individual forts 
10
in the defenses of Washington (on both sides of the 
11
Potomac and Anacostia Rivers) were involved in 
12
stopping General Early’s attack. Had that one battle 
13
at the very edge of Washington been lost, the Na-
14
tion’s capital, the Presidency, the Union Govern-
15
ment, and emancipation all would have been poten-
16
tially lost and the history of the United States dra-
17
matically changed. The victory at Fort Stevens not 
18
only saved the city and the national government, but 
19
also led to the October 1864 victories for the Union 
20
in the Shenandoah Valley, which ensured Lincoln’s 
21
re-election and preservation of the Union at that 
22
critical moment. 
23
(7) After the end of the war, most of the Civil 
24
War defenses of Washington were returned to pri-
25
02:59 Apr 14, 2022
H7495
6 
•HR 7495 IH
vate land owners, but many were retained by the 
1
military or the lands were repurchased later by the 
2
United States. Of the remaining fortifications in 
3
public ownership, 19 sites (including Battleground 
4
Cemetery) are owned by the Federal Government 
5
and managed by the National Park Service, four are 
6
owned by local units of government in northern Vir-
7
ginia, and one is owned by Montgomery County, 
8
Maryland. 
9
(8) In 1902, the Senate McMillan Commission 
10
issued a Report on the Improvement of the Park 
11
System of Washington (U.S. Senate Committee on 
12
the District of Columbia, Senate Report No. 166, 
13
57th Congress, 1st Session). The Report called for 
14
development of a ‘‘Fort Drive’’ to connect the Civil 
15
War defenses of Washington in the Nation’s capital. 
16
Congress appropriated funds to purchase lands for 
17
the Fort Drive during the 1930s, but it was never 
18
fully completed. 
19
(9) Most of the remaining Civil War defenses of 
20
Washington contain significant natural and rec-
21
reational resources, and some offer sweeping vistas 
22
overlooking the Nation’s capital. With the lands ac-
23
quired for the Fort Drive, they provide a linkage of 
24
urban green spaces that contribute to the history, 
25

•HR 7495 IH
character, and scenic values of the Nation’s capital 
1
and offer educational and recreational opportunities 
2
along with their natural and important historical 
3
values. 
4
(10) Sites associated with the Civil War de-
5
fenses of Washington that are in Federal ownership 
6
within the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth 
7
of Virginia, and the State of Maryland are managed 
8
under three separate units of the National Park 
9
Service (Rock Creek Park, National Capital Parks– 
10
East, and the George Washington Memorial Park-
11
way). Action by Congress is needed to protect and 
12
aid the educational benefits of the unique place in 
13
history of these sites through proper management, 
14
stabilization, maintenance, development, use, and, 
15
importantly, interpretation. 
16
(11) It is fitting and proper that, as Americans 
17
reflect upon the legacy of the Civil War, we more 
18
fully understand and appreciate the roles of the bat-
19
tles in the District of Columbia, Virginia, West Vir-
20
ginia, and Maryland related to the defenses of 
21
Washington. Taken together, these battles were piv-
22
otal to the outcome of the war and therefore to its 
23
impact on the promise of the United States. It is 
24
therefore in the national interest that these histori-
25

•HR 7495 IH
cally important sites and resources be protected 
1
from further damage or loss and that they be pre-
2
served, enhanced, and interpreted for the use, enjoy-
3
ment, and education of present and future genera-
4
tions. 
5
(12) There is a genuine need and compelling 
6
reason for the United States to rededicate itself to 
7
and honor the vision and ideals of democracy as re-
8
flected in the Constitution by commemorating and 
9
interpreting through this National Historical Park 
10
the epic story of the American Civil War and the 
11
profound and lasting impact of the war on the val-
12
ues, capabilities, and strengths that the United 
13
States reflects through the ideals that it stands for 
14
in the world today. 
15
(b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this Act are— 
16
(1) to protect, preserve, enhance, and interpret 
17
for the benefit and use of present and future genera-
18
tions the cultural, historical, natural, and rec-
19
reational resources of the Civil War defenses of 
20
Washington located in the District of Columbia, Vir-
21

23
