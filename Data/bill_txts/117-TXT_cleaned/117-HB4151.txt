SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds as follows: 
2
(1) Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (referred 
3
to in this section as ‘‘FASD’’), is a serious and com-
4
plex public health issue impacting individuals, fami-
5
lies, and communities throughout the United States, 
6
regardless of race, sex, culture, or geography. This 
7
Act provides an opportunity for our Nation to ex-
8
plore strategies to not only prevent the adverse ef-
9
fects of prenatal alcohol exposure (referred to in this 
10
section as ‘‘PAE’’) but heal individual, historical, 
11
and cultural traumas. 
12
(2) Exposure to alcohol has long-lasting con-
13
sequences for a developing fetus, which may lead to 
14
a range of life-long physical, mental, social, and 
15
emotional problems. There is no known safe amount 
16
of alcohol use during pregnancy or while trying to 
17
get pregnant. There is also no safe time during 
18
pregnancy to drink. All types of alcohol are equally 
19
harmful, including all wines and beer. 
20
(3) The most recent prevalence study identified 
21
as many as 1 in 20 first graders across the country 
22
are affected by PAE. Given that nearly 45 percent 
23
of pregnancies are unintended and women often 
24
don’t know that they are pregnant until they are 6 
25
weeks along or more, it’s easy to understand how a 
26

•HR 4151 IH
woman could drink alcohol while expecting. Research 
1
shows that solely focusing on individual women’s be-
2
havior as FASD prevention strategy perpetuates 
3
stigma and blame on biological mothers, individuals 
4
impacted by FASD, and the condition itself. 
5
(4) Although research shows that White, col-
6
lege-educated, middle- to upper-class women are the 
7
most likely group to drink during pregnancy, one of 
8
the common misnomers about FASD is that it is an 
9
‘‘indigenous issue’’. Continued surveillance, stig-
10
matization, and stereotyping of Indigenous popu-
11
lations may contribute to the misbelief that FASD 
12
is over-represented in these communities. 
13
(5) In their recent landmark survey, ‘‘Lay of 
14
the Land: Equality vs. Equity’’, the FASD Change-
15
makers, comprised of young adults with FASD, doc-
16
umented the social determinants of health that lead 
17
to the detrimental health disparities people with 
18
FASD often endure, including victimization result-
19
ing in incarceration, homelessness, reduced access to 
20
health care, vulnerabilities to substance misuse, and 
21
unemployment. 
22
(6) The higher prevalence of FASD in criminal 
23
justice and foster care systems has been docu-
24
mented. Nearly 1 out of 4 children in juvenile cor-
25

•HR 4151 IH
rections has FASD, and prevalence estimates among 
1
children in the foster care systems range from 23 
2
percent to 60 percent. Prevalence in adult correc-
3
tions ranges from 11 percent to 25 percent. 
4
(7) The National Academy of Medicine rec-
5
ommendations for a broad Federal response formed 
6
the basis of the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal 
7
Alcohol Effect Prevention and Services Act of 1998 
8
that authorized $27,000,000 for a National Task 
9
Force on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and grant pro-
10
grams at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse 
11
and Alcoholism, the Centers for Disease Control and 
12
Prevention, and the Substance Abuse and Mental 
13
Health Services Administration. 
14
(8) In 2009, the National Task Force on Fetal 
15
Alcohol Syndrome reported FASD diagnostic capac-
16
ity and FASD-informed services insufficient in the 
17
United States, resulting in countless individuals with 
18
FASD remaining unrecognized or misdiagnosed. 
19
(9) Despite PAE remaining the leading pre-
20
ventable cause of birth defects and neurodevelop-
21
mental disabilities in the United States, the author-
22
ity for the National Task Force on Fetal Alcohol 
23
Syndrome expired, SAMHSA funding for FASD

ended in 2015, and other Federal and State FASD- 
1
related funding declined. 
2
(10) FASD is preventable. Although there is no 
3
cure for individuals impacted by FASD, research 
4
shows that intervention services and supports that 
5
include social, environmental, and educational strate-
6
gies can prevent subsequent trauma to the indi-
7
vidual, the individual’s caregivers, and society. 
8
(11) Building coordinated State and Tribal 
9
FASD systems of care that offer integrated cul-
10
turally appropriate services and supports grounded 
11
in best practices can mitigate the harms created by 
12
historical and cultural trauma.
