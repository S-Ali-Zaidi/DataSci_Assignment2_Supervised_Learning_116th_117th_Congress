A BILL 
To amend the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to allow 
all eligible voters to vote by mail in Federal elections, 
to amend the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 
to provide for automatic voter registration, and for other 
purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Vote at Home Act of 
2
2021’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) An inequity of voting rights exists in the 
6
United States because voters in some States have 
7
the universal right to vote by mail while voters in 
8
other States do not. 
9
(2) Many voters often have work, family, or 
10
other commitments that make getting to polls and 
11
waiting in line on the date of an election difficult or 
12
impossible. Many citizens with disabilities are phys-
13
ically unable to vote due to long lines, inadequate 
14
parking, no curb cuts, steep ramps, and large 
15
crowds. In 2012, 30 percent of voters with disabil-
16
ities had difficulty voting, and in 2016, nearly two- 
17
thirds of the 137 polling places inspected on Elec-
18
tion Day had at least one impediment to people with 
19
disabilities. Under current State laws, many of these 
20
voters are not permitted to vote by mail. 
21
(3) In 2020, despite a global pandemic, the 
22
general election saw record high turnout as a result 
23
of increased vote by mail options, which allowed vot-
24
ers to cast a ballot and stay safe at the same time. 
25

•HR 237 IH
(4) 34 States and the District of Columbia cur-
1
rently allow universal absentee voting (also known as 
2
‘‘no-excuse’’ absentee voting), which permits any 
3
voter to request a mail-in ballot without providing a 
4
reason for the request. No State which has imple-
5
mented no-excuse absentee voting has repealed it. 
6
(5) 5 States currently hold elections entirely by 
7
mail. At least 22 States currently allow some elec-
8
tions to be conducted by mail, especially in large and 
9
rural jurisdictions where voting by mail is especially 
10
convenient. Polling stations in rural jurisdictions 
11
tend to have higher costs per voter, smaller staffs, 
12
and limited resources. Transportation is often a cru-
13
cial barrier for rural voters. 
14
(6) In 2020, in order to provide greater accessi-
15
bility and to protect the public health, 30 States 
16
adopted or changed their laws for the general elec-
17
tion to allow voters to cast their ballots from home. 
18
These changes included removing strict excuse re-
19
quirements or allowing COVID-19 concerns to be a 
20
valid excuse to vote absentee, allowing ballot drop 
21
boxes, offering prepaid postage on election mail and 
22
proactively sending all active registered voters appli-
23
cations to request an absentee ballot, with some even 
24
skipping that step and sending the actual ballots.

•HR 237 IH
(7) Voting by mail gives voters more time to 
1
consider their choices, which is especially important 
2
as many ballots contain greater numbers of ques-
3
tions about complex issues than in the past due to 
4
the expanded use of the initiative and referendum 
5
process in many States. 
6
(8) Voting by mail is cost effective. After the 
7
State of Oregon adopted vote by mail for all voters 
8
in 1996, the cost to administer an election in the 
9
State dropped by nearly 30 percent over the next 
10
few elections, from $3.07 per voter to $2.21 per 
11
voter. After Colorado implemented all-mail balloting 
12
in 2013, voting administration costs decreased by an 
13
average of 40 percent. The cost of conducting vote- 
14
by-mail elections is generally one-third to one-half 
15
less than conducting polling place elections. Voting 
16
by mail also saves a substantial amount by getting 
17
rid of the temporary labor costs of hiring poll work-
18
ers. In addition to that cost, many jurisdictions have 
19
been facing difficulty in obtaining sufficient numbers 
20
of poll workers. 
21
(9) Allowing all voters the option to vote by 
22
mail can reduce waiting times for those voters who 
23
choose to vote at the polls. In 2016, voters in Ari-
24
zona reported waiting in line from 1 to 5 hours to 
25
22:35 Feb 04, 2021
H237
5 
•HR 237 IH
vote; in New York, voters reported that stations ran 
1
out of ballots and did not have staff during all of 
2
the hours scheduled for voting. 
3
(10) Voting by mail is preferable to many vot-
4
ers as an alternative to going to the polls. In 2018, 
5
25.3 percent of ballots in the United States were 
6
cast by mail, up from 10 percent in 2000. Voting by 
7
mail has become increasingly popular with voters 
8
who want to be certain that they are able to vote no 
9
matter what comes up on Election Day, as it re-
10
duces the physical obstacles and eases the time con-
11
straints connected with the act of voting. 
12
(11) Despite attempts to claim that voting by 
13
mail is susceptible to fraud, it is not. Strategies such 
14
as the tracking systems for ballots and Postal Serv-
15
ice cooperation in preventing ballots from being de-
16
livered to names not recognized as receiving mail at 
17
an address nearly eliminate the potential for fraud 
18
in vote by mail elections. Evidence of undue influ-
19
ence or voter coercion after vote-by-mail implementa-
20
tion in Oregon has been nonexistent to minimal. 
21
(12) Many of the reasons which voters in many 
22
States are required to provide in order to vote by 
23
mail require the revelation of personal information 
24
about health, travel plans, or religious activities, 
25
22:35 Feb 04, 2021
H237
6 
•HR 237 IH
which violate voters’ privacy while doing nothing to 
1
prevent voter fraud. 
2
(13) State laws which require voters to obtain 
3
a notary signature to vote by mail only add cost and 
4
inconvenience to voters without increasing security. 
5
(14) Many voters choose to cast ballots early 
6
when they have the option (over 50 percent in Ari-
7
zona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Geor-
8
gia, Hawaii, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, North 
9
Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and 
10
Washington). More than 40 percent of voters in the 
11
2016 election cast their ballot before Election Day. 
12
In Oregon, 7 years after vote-by-mail election imple-
13
mentation, over 80 percent of voters favored the 
14
vote-by-mail system. 
15
(15) Vote-by-mail typically increases turnout in 
16
all elections, but can be particularly effective in in-
17
creasing voter participation in special elections and 
18
primary elections. Oregon, Washington, and Colo-
19
rado, 3 of the 5 States with entirely vote by mail 
20
systems, continue to have consistently high voter 
21
turnout rates. In the 2016 Presidential election, 
22
while the percentage of registered voters who cast a 
23
ballot nationally was 68.1 percent, Oregon’s was 
24
22:35 Feb 04, 2021
H237
7 
•HR 237 IH
80.3 percent, Washington’s was 78.76 percent, and 
1
Colorado’s was 74.3 percent. 
2
(16) A crucial component of a modern voting 
3
system is making it easy, affordable, and accessible 
4
to register to vote. Twenty states and the District of 
5
Columbia have enacted automatic voter registration 
6
policies, with Oregon and California becoming the 
7
first to automatically register their citizens to vote 
8
when they apply for a driver’s license. Automatic, 
9
permanent voter registration has the potential to in-
10
crease participation, protect election integrity, and 
11
reduce registration costs.
