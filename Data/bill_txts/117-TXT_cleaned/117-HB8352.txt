A BILL 
To protect clean air and public health by expanding fenceline 
and ambient air monitoring and access to air quality 
information for communities affected by air pollution, 
to require hazardous air pollutant monitoring at the 
fenceline of facilities whose emissions are linked to local 
health threats, to ensure the Environmental Protection 
Agency promulgates rules that require hazardous air pol-
lutant data measurement and electronic submission at 
fencelines and stacks of industrial source categories, to

4
ing the area in which the sensor is to be deployed.

7
after the date on which an air quality sensor de-
8
ployed pursuant to subsection (a) has been moni-
9
toring air quality data for 1 year, the Administrator 
10
shall determine whether data from the air quality 
11
sensors deployed in the applicable census tract or 
12
county shows air pollution levels over the 1-year pe-
13
riod ending on the date of the determination that 
14
reached 98 percent of the level of the national ambi-

county for each pollutant that met the threshold.

(3) EXCEPTIONS.—The Administrator shall 
3
waive the requirement of paragraph (2) if the Ad-
4
ministrator finds, within the 180-day period de-
5
scribed in such paragraph, and after providing no-
6
tice and an opportunity for public comment, that 
7
based on clear and convincing evidence— 
8
(A) the measurements from the sensor or 
9
sensors supporting the determination described 
10
in paragraph (2) were so inaccurate as to pro-
11
vide no reasonable basis for finding that levels 
12
of the relevant pollutant reached 98 percent of 
13
the level of the national ambient air quality 
14
standard under section 109 of the Clean Air 
15
Act (42 U.S.C. 7409) for the relevant pollutant;

18
tion on the ambient matric, meteorology, meas-
19
urements from other nearby sensors or ambient 
20
monitors, modeling, satellite data, or other rel-

standard.
