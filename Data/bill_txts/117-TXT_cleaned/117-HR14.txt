RESOLUTION 
Censuring and condemning President Donald J. Trump for 
attempting to overturn the results of the November 2020 
presidential election in the State of Georgia. 
Whereas, on January 2, 2021, President Donald J. Trump 
called Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger; 
Whereas during that call President Trump repeatedly asked 
Secretary Raffensperger to overturn the finalized and 
verified results of the November 2020 presidential elec-
tion in the State of Georgia; 
Whereas President Trump misused the power of his office by 
threatening an elected official with vague criminal con-
sequences if he failed to pursue the president’s false 
claims; 
Whereas President Trump’s actions and statements on this 
call demonstrate an attempt to willfully deprive the citi-
zens of Georgia of a fair and impartial election process 
in direct contravention of both Federal law and the laws 
of the State of Georgia; 
Whereas President Trump has repeatedly propagated baseless 
conspiracy theories in statements and on social media, 
falsely claimed that he won the November 3, 2020, presi-
dential election, and attempted to incite his supporters to 
undermine our constitutional principles; and 
Whereas, as a result of President Trump’s words and actions, 
the lawful results of free and fair elections in the United 
States have been put in danger: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
