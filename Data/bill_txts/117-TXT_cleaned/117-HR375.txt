Whereas racial disparities persist in young people’s sexual 
health, highlighting ongoing social inequities in access to 
sex education as well as sexual health services; 
Whereas access to quality information and education about 
young people’s sexual health is a critical step toward ad-
dressing disparities caused by structural barriers; 
Whereas despite historic declines, the United States has the 
highest rate of unintended teen pregnancy among com-
parable countries and limited resources available for 
young parents; 
Whereas young people aged 15 through 25 contract half of 
the 19 million sexually transmitted infections each year, 
despite making up only a quarter of the sexually active 
population; 
Whereas young people under the age of 25 accounted for 1 
in 5 new HIV transmissions; 
Whereas three-quarters of LGBT students report harass-
ment, 56 percent report feeling unsafe, and nearly a 
third skipped at least one day of school in the month 
prior to reporting due to concerns for their safety; 
Whereas approximately 1 in 3 young women in the United 
States experiences physical, emotional, or verbal abuse 
from a dating partner; 
Whereas sex education that includes information beyond ab-
stinence has been found to delay sexual intercourse, in-
crease condom or contraceptive use, reduce the number 
of partners among young people, and decrease physical 
aggression with intimate partners; 
Whereas young people who received sex education are 50 per-
cent less likely to experience an unintended pregnancy, 
31 percent less likely to contract a sexually transmitted

infection, and more likely to delay sexual activity and use 
contraception upon becoming sexually active; 
Whereas sex education provides information about the pre-
vention, treatment, and care of pregnancy, sexually trans-
mitted infections, and interpersonal violence; the impor-
tance of consent as a basis for healthy relationships and 
for autonomy in health care; sexual orientation, gender 
roles, and gender discrimination; and the historical and 
current conditions in which education and health sys-
tems, policies, programs, services, and practices have 
uniquely adversely impacted Black, indigenous, Latinx, 
Asian, Asian American and Pacific Islander, and other 
people of color; 
Whereas sex education promotes gender equity, and is inclu-
sive of young people with varying gender identities, gen-
der expressions, and sexual orientations; safe and healthy 
relationships; and racial equity ensuring responsiveness 
to the needs of young people who are Black, indigenous, 
and other people of color; 
Whereas sex education promotes and upholds the rights of 
young people to information that empowers them to make 
decisions about their bodies, health, sexuality, families, 
and communities in all areas of life; and 
Whereas May of each year is now recognized as Sex Ed For 
All Month: Now, therefore, be it
