SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
16
It is the sense of Congress that— 
17
(1) lead is a dangerous neurotoxin that can per-
18
manently impact brain development, especially in 
19
young children; 
20
(2) the Centers for Disease Control, the Envi-
21
ronmental Protection Agency, the American Associa-
22
tion of Pediatrics, and many other entities have de-
23
termined that there is no safe level of lead exposure;

•HR 7516 IH
(3) for vulnerable populations like young chil-
1
dren, pregnant mothers, and the elderly, exposure to 
2
lead can be life altering; 
3
(4) evidence is mounting that the lead in drink-
4
ing water problem in the United States is grossly 
5
underestimated and inadequately addressed; 
6
(5) according to the Environmental Protection 
7
Agency, lead service lines are the single largest 
8
source of lead in drinking water; and 
9
(6) partial lead service line replacement, where 
10
only a portion of a lead service line is replaced, can 
11
increase lead exposure.

4
(A) not later than 1 day after the date on
