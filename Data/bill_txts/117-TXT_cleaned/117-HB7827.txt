A BILL 
To impose a moratorium on large agribusiness, food and 
beverage manufacturing, and grocery retail mergers. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Concentration in the food and agricultural 
8
economy, including mergers, acquisitions, and other 
9

combinations and alliances among suppliers, pack-
1
ers, integrators, other food processors, distributors, 
2
and retailers has been accelerating at a rapid pace 
3
since the 1980s, and particularly since the 2007 
4
through 2009 recession. 
5
(2) The trend toward greater concentration in 
6
food and agriculture has important and far reaching 
7
implications not only for family farmers, but also for 
8
food chain workers, the food we eat, the commu-
9
nities we live in, the integrity of the natural environ-
10
ment upon which we all depend, and for our collec-
11
tive public health. 
12
(3) The infant formula industry, for example, 
13
has reached an alarming level of corporate con-
14
centration with 4 companies now controlling nearly 
15
90 percent of the infant formula market. A disrup-
16
tion in the supply of just 1 infant formula producer 
17
now presents a grave risk to infant health in the 
18
United States. 
19
(4) In the past 4 decades, the top 4 largest 
20
pork packers have seized control of 70 percent of the 
21
market, up from 36 percent. Over the same period, 
22
the top 4 beef packers have expanded their market 
23
share from 32 percent to 85 percent. The top 4 flour 
24
millers have increased their market share from 40 
25

percent to 64 percent. The market share of the top 
1
4 soybean crushers has jumped from 54 percent to 
2
79 percent, and the top 4 wet corn processors con-
3
trol of the market has increased from 63 percent to 
4
86 percent. 
5
(5) Today the top 4 sheep, poultry, and fluid 
6
milk processors now control 62 percent, 54 percent, 
7
and 50 percent of the market, respectively. 
8
(6) The top 4 grain companies today control as 
9
much as 90 percent of the global grain trade. 
10
(7) During the past 5 years there has been a 
11
wave of consolidation among global seed and crop- 
12
chemical firms, 3 companies now control nearly 2⁄3 
13
of the world’s commodity crop seeds. Those same 3 
14
companies now also control nearly 70 percent of all 
15
agricultural chemicals and pesticides. 
16
(8) In the United States, the 4 largest corn 
17
seed sellers accounted for 85 percent of the market 
18
in 2015, up from 60 percent in 2000. Over the past 
19
20 years, the cost for an acre’s worth of seeds for 
20
an average corn farmer has nearly quadrupled, and 
21
the cost of fertilizer has more than doubled. Yet 
22
corn yields increased only 36 percent over that time, 
23
and the price received for the sale of a bushel of 
24
corn increased only 31 percent.

(9) A handful of firms dominate the processing 
1
of every major commodity. Many of them are 
2
vertically integrated, which means that they control 
3
successive stages of the food chain, from inputs to 
4
production to distribution. The growing number and 
5
scale of cross-border agribusiness and food mergers 
6
have put foreign firms, often with considerable gov-
7
ernment backing, into prominent and even dominant 
8
positions in the United States beef, hog, poultry, 
9
seed, fertilizer, and agrichemical sectors. 
10
(10) Growing concentration of the agricultural 
11
sector has restricted choices for farmers trying to 
12
sell their products. As the bargaining power of agri-
13
business firms over farmers increases, concentrated 
14
agricultural commodity markets are stacked against 
15
the farmer, with buyers of agricultural commodities 
16
often possessing regional dominance in the form of 
17
oligopsony or monopsony relative to sellers of such 
18
commodities. 
19
(11) The high concentration and consolidation 
20
of buyers in agricultural markets has resulted in the 
21
thinning of both cash and future markets, thereby 
22
allowing dominant buyers to leverage their market 
23
shares to move those markets to the detriment of 
24
family farmers and ranchers.

•HR 7827 IH
(12) 
Buyers 
with 
oligopsonistic 
or 
1
monopsonistic power have incentives to engage in 
2
unfair and discriminatory acts that cause farmers to 
3
receive less than a competitive price for their goods. 
4
At the same time, some Federal courts have incor-
5
rectly required a plaintiff to show harm to competi-
6
tion generally, in addition to harm to the individual 
7
farmer, when making a determination that an un-
8
fair, unjustly discriminatory, deceptive, or pref-
9
erential act exists under the Packers and Stockyards 
10
Act of 1921. 
11
(13) The farmer’s share of every retail dollar 
12
has plummeted from 41 percent in 1950, to less 
13
than 15 percent today, while the profit share for 
14
farm input, marketing, and processing companies 
15
has risen. 
16
(14) While agribusiness conglomerates are post-
17
ing record earnings, farmers are facing desperate 
18
times. Since 2013, net farm income for United 
19
States farmers has fallen by more than half and me-
20
dian on farm income was negative in 2020. 
21
(15) The benefits of low commodity prices are 
22
not being passed on to American consumers. The 
23
gap between what shoppers pay for food and what 
24
farmers are paid is growing wider. 
25
02:05 May 20, 2022

•HR 7827 IH
(16) The steadily rising price of food has out-
1
paced growth in incomes for typical workers. Since 
2
the Great Recession, the annual growth of real 
3
prices for food at the supermarket have risen nearly 
4
3 times faster than typical earnings. 
5
(17) There is a growing consensus that eco-
6
nomic consolidation contributes to the widening gap 
7
in economic opportunity in the United States and 
8
bigger, more dominant firms are more likely to de-
9
liver profits to investors than to raise wages or bene-
10
fits. Mega-mergers in the food and agribusiness in-
11
dustries can lead to growing monopsony power abuse 
12
resulting in wage suppression, along with massive 
13
layoffs as companies shutter factories and facilities, 
14
harming working families and communities. 
15
(18) Concentration, low prices, anticompetitive 
16
practices, and other manipulations and abuses of the 
17
agricultural economy are driving small family farm-
18
ers out of business. Farmers are going bankrupt or 
19
giving up, and few are taking their places; more 
20
farm families are having to rely on other jobs to stay 
21
afloat. Seventy-nine percent of farm household in-
22
come came from off farm work in 2020, up from 53 
23
percent in 1960.

•HR 7827 IH
(19) Eighty-one percent of America’s farmed 
1
cropland is now controlled by 15 percent of farms, 
2
and the number of farmers leaving the land will con-
3
tinue to increase unless and until these trends are 
4
reversed. 
5
(20) The decline of small family farms under-
6
mines the economies of rural communities across 
7
America; it has pushed Main Street businesses, from 
8
equipment suppliers to small banks, out of business 
9
or to the brink of insolvency. 
10
(21) Increased concentration in the agribusiness 
11
sector has a harmful effect on the environment; cor-
12
porate hog farming, for example, threatens the in-
13
tegrity of local water supplies and creates noxious 
14
odors in neighboring communities. Concentration 
15
also can increase the risks to food safety and limit 
16
the biodiversity of plants and animals. 
17
(22) The decline of family farming poses a di-
18
rect threat to American families and family values, 
19
by subjecting farm families to turmoil and stress. 
20
Farm advocates across the country are reporting an 
21
increase in farmer suicides over the past several 
22
years. 
23
(23) The decline of family farming causes the 
24
demise of rural communities, as stores lose cus-
25

•HR 7827 IH
tomers, churches lose congregations, schools and 
1
clinics become under-used, career opportunities for 
2
young people dry up, and local inequalities of wealth 
3
and income grow wider. 
4
(24) These developments are not the result of 
5
inevitable market forces. Its problems arise rather 
6
from policies made in Washington, including farm, 
7
antitrust, and trade policies. 
8
(25) Past congressional action to remediate 
9
market failure, such as enacting country-of-origin la-
10
beling to provide transparency for domestic farmers, 
11
ranchers, and consumers regarding agricultural com-
12
modity origins, have been overturned for key com-
13
modities by oligopolistic conglomerates that use un-
14
differentiated imports to reduce domestic farm 
15
prices. 
16
(26) To restore competition in the agricultural 
17
economy, and to increase the bargaining power and 
18
enhance economic prospects for family farmers, the 
19
trend toward concentration must be reversed.
