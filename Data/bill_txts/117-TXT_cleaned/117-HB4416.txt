•HR 4416 IH
(1) On March 20, 2020, the Centers for Dis-
1
ease Control and Prevention issued an order (re-
2
ferred to in this section as the ‘‘title 42 expulsion 
3
order’’) pursuant to sections 362 and 365 of the 
4
Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 265 and 268), 
5
which authorizes the Surgeon General to prohibit 
6
the introduction of certain persons into the United 
7
States from countries where an outbreak of a com-
8
municable disease, such as the deadly COVID–19 
9
pandemic, exists when necessary to protect the pub-
10
lic health from such disease. 
11
(2) The title 42 expulsion order was extended 
12
on April 20, 2020, and later amended on May 19, 
13
2020, to further extend the duration of such expul-
14
sions, subject to monthly review. 
15
(3) In 2020, U.S. Border Patrol made 382,374 
16
title 42 expulsions to protect the United States from 
17
further introduction of COVID–19. 
18
(4) In January 2021, the Biden administration, 
19
acting 
‘‘swiftly 
and 
aggressively 
to 
combat 
20
coronavirus disease 2019’’, issued proclamations sus-
21
pending entry into the United States of travelers 
22
from the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, 
23
South Africa, and many other countries.

(5) As of June 14, 2021, Mexico, Honduras, 
1
and Guatemala each had sufficiently high new inci-
2
dents of COVID–19 to receive a COVID–19 Risk 
3
Assessment Level 3 (high) rating by the Centers for 
4
Disease Control and Prevention, which is the same 
5
level of COVID–19 risk as many of the countries 
6
from which entry is suspended to travelers under the 
7
Biden administration proclamations, including the 
8
United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, South Af-
9
rica, and others. 
10
(6) Staggering numbers of migrants are flood-
11
ing across the international border between the 
12
United States and Mexico, resulting in a humani-
13
tarian, public safety, and national security crisis. 
14
During the first 5 months of 2021, U.S. Border Pa-
15
trol had more than 687,854 encounters with undocu-
16
mented migrants at the Southwest border, with un-
17
documented migrants from Mexico and the Northern 
18
Triangle countries accounting for 569,298 of those 
19
encounters, or roughly 83 percent of the total. Dur-
20
ing April 2021, U.S. Border Patrol encountered 
21
more aliens along the Southwest border than during 
22
any other month since 2001.

(7) News outlets have reported that the Biden 
1
administration will shortly end the necessary and ef-
2
fective title 42 expulsion policy. 
3
(8) As countries continue to pose a high risk of 
4
transmission of COVID–19, the Biden administra-
5
tion should continue to exercise the expulsion au-
6
thority granted under section 362 of the Public 
7
Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 265) to ‘‘prevent fur-
8
ther spread of the disease’’.
