SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
The Congress finds as follows: 
2
(1) The Federal Bureau of Investigation defines 
3
‘‘hate crime’’ to be a criminal offense—such as mur-
4
der, arson, or vandalism—against a person or prop-
5
erty motivated in whole or in part by an offender’s 
6
bias against a race, religion, disability, sexual ori-
7
entation, ethnicity, gender, or gender identity. 
8
(2) Forty-five States and the District of Colum-
9
bia have statutes criminalizing various types of bias- 
10
motivated violence or intimidation. 
11
(3) The Federal Government has implemented 
12
crimes statutes since 1968, with the most recent law 
13
enacted in 2009. 
14
(4) In 2019, hate crimes rose by 2.7 percent. 
15
(5) In 2019, there were 51 reported deaths 
16
from hate crimes, which is the highest number since 
17
the FBI began reporting on this statistic in the 
18
early 1990s. 
19
(6) Hate crimes not only damage the individual 
20
victim or victims, but also traumatize entire commu-
21
nities and erode public confidence in their safety. 
22
(7) In 2019, hate crimes directed at Latinos in-
23
creased by almost 9 percent from the year before. 
24
(8) In 2019, hate crimes based on sexual ori-
25
entation represented 16.7% of total hate crimes that

HR 1834 IH
year, and gender identity based hate crimes rep-
1
resented 2.7% of total hate crimes, which was an in-
2
crease from the year before. 
3
(9) In a September 2020 House Homeland Se-
4
curity Committee testimony, FBI Director Chris-
5
topher Wray said: ‘‘Within the domestic terrorism 
6
bucket, the category as a whole, racially motivated 
7
violent extremism is, I think, the biggest bucket 
8
within that larger group. And within the racially mo-
9
tivated violent extremist bucket, people subscribing 
10
to some kind of White supremacist-type ideology is 
11
certainly the biggest chunk of that.’’. 
12
(10) The largest increase within the 2019 hate 
13
crime data was found in anti-Semitic hate crimes, 
14
which rose by 14 percent. 
15
(11) In August 2019, an assailant entered a 
16
Walmart in El Paso, Texas, to target Hispanics and 
17
left 22 dead. 
18
(12) In October 2018, a shooting at the Tree 
19
of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, left 
20
11 dead. 
21
(13) In July 2019, a Hindu priest in New York 
22
City was hospitalized after a man attacked him and 
23
screamed ‘‘this is my neighborhood’’ during the inci-
24
dent.

(14) In response to the Coronavirus pandemic, 
1
Asian Americans have suffered an increasing num-
2
ber of hate crimes. According to Stop AAPI Hate, 
3
2,808 ‘‘hate incidents’’ toward AAPIs were reported 
4
between March and December 2020. 
5
(15) In November 2020, a woman shouted anti- 
6
Muslim slurs and attacked a couple in New York 
7
City, leaving one victim needing surgery for facial 
8
fractures. 
9
(16) Many hate crimes go unreported. In 2019, 
10
there was a decrease in the number of police agen-
11
cies providing this data to the FBI, with only 14 
12
percent of police agencies in the country reporting 
13
one or more hate crimes that year. 
14
(17) There is a clear need for stronger action 
15
to accurately report and effectively combat hate- 
16
based attacks.
