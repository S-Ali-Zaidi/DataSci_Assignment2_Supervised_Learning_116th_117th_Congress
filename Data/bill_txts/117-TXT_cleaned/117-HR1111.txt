Whereas the Court’s power of judicial review is a necessary 
check to ensure that each branch of government does not 
exceed its authority under the Constitution; 
Whereas our constitutional system and the rule of law rely 
upon the independence of judges who are not subject to 
the whims of public opinion or the political process; 
Whereas the recent leak of a draft opinion in Dobbs v. Jack-
son Women’s Health Organization constitutes a grave 
breach of judicial ethics and a blatant attack on the inde-
pendence of the Court; 
Whereas following the leak of the draft opinion in Dobbs v. 
Jackson Women’s Health Organization, churches and the 
headquarters of a pro-life organization were firebombed 
and vandalized, and activists sought to intimidate Jus-
tices of the Supreme Court by protesting outside their 
homes; and 
Whereas Federal law (18 U.S.C. 1507) provides: ‘‘Whoever, 
with the intent of interfering with, obstructing, or imped-
ing the administration of justice, or with the intent of in-
fluencing any judge, juror, witness, or court officer, in 
the discharge of his duty, pickets or parades in or near 
a building housing a court of the United States, or in or 
near a building or residence occupied or used by such 
judge, juror, witness, or court officer, or with such intent 
uses any sound-truck or similar device or resorts to any 
other demonstration in or near any such building or resi-
dence, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not 
more than one year, or both.’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—

(1) condemns the unauthorized leak of the draft

opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Orga-

nization and the ensuing violence, damage to prop-

Supreme Court by proabortion activists; 
3
(2) expresses deep concern regarding the ero-

sion of Americans’ faith in our institutions;

judiciary must remain free from political inter-

impartial justice under the law; and

with respect to protests outside of the homes of sit-
