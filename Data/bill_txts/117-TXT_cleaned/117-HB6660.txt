SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘First Rhode Island 
2
Regiment Congressional Gold Medal Act’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress makes the following findings: 
5
(1) During the winter at Valley Forge, from 
6
1777–1778, the Continental Army had difficulty re-
7
cruiting the necessary quotas of men set by the Con-
8
gress. 
9
(2) At the same time, the State of Rhode Island 
10
was ordered to supply two battalions while faced 
11
with the occupation of the City of Newport by the 
12
British. 
13
(3) In January 1778, at the urging of Brigadier 
14
General James Varnum, General George Washington 
15
wrote to Governor Nicholas Cooke of the State of 
16
Rhode Island requesting assistance recruiting men 
17
for the Continental Line. 
18
(4) On February 14, 1778, the Rhode Island 
19
General Assembly voted to allow the enlistment of 
20
‘‘every able-bodied negro, mulatto, or Indian man 
21
slave’’. 
22
(5) In addition, the Rhode Island General As-
23
sembly provided that any enlisted slave ‘‘upon his 
24
passing muster before Colonel Christopher Greene, 
25
be immediately discharged from the service of his 
26

master or mistress, and be absolutely free as though 
1
he had never been incumbered and be incumbered 
2
with any kind of servitude or slavery.’’. 
3
(6) As a result, between February 1778 and 
4
June 1778, Colonel Christopher Greene, Lt. Colonel 
5
Jeremiah Olney and Major Samuel Ward recruited 
6
almost 200 men of African heritage and Indigenous 
7
descent who formed the core of the First Rhode Is-
8
land Regiment. 
9
(7) The First Rhode Island Regiment became 
10
among the first units in American History in which 
11
men of every race and ethnicity were recruited to 
12
serve. 
13
(8) On August 28, 1778, at the Battle of 
14
Rhode Island, following an attempted siege of Brit-
15
ish-occupied Newport along with the newly allied 
16
French fleet, the First Rhode Island Regiment acted 
17
heroically in holding back Hessian forces and caus-
18
ing them to retreat. 
19
(9) During the Battle of Rhode Island, the 
20
First Rhode Island Regiment’s losses included three 
21
killed, nine wounded and eleven missing soldiers. 
22
(10) For an additional 5 years, the First Rhode 
23
Island Regiment fought bravely to win American 
24

independence including at Fort Oswego, Saratoga, 
1
and Yorktown. 
2
(11) On June 13, 1783, at Saratoga, the First 
3
Rhode Island Regiment was demobilized. 
4
(12) Their commander, Colonel Jeremiah 
5
Olney, praised the Regiment for ‘‘faithfully pre-
6
serving in the best of causes, in every stage of serv-
7
ice, with unexampled fortitude and patience through 
8
all the danger and toils of a long and severe war’’. 
9
(13) Afterwards, some veterans of the First 
10
Rhode Island Regiment had to consistently resist ef-
11
forts at re-enslavement and fought for back wages 
12
from the Rhode Island General Assembly. 
13
(14) According to the Rhode Island State Ar-
14
chives, the First Rhode Island Regiment included at 
15
least the following soldiers: Babcock, Priamus (Pri-
16
mus); Bent, Prince; Bours, Cato; Brown, Priamus
