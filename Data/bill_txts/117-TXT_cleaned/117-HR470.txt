alienable human rights, economic rights, civil rights, and 
social and political equity at home and abroad and con-
demning discrimination, persecution, and violence against

tion of any kind such as race, color, sex, language, reli-
gion, political opinion or other opinion, national or social 
origin, property, birth, or other status, and Articles 2, 
14, and 26 of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights reinforce this right to equality for all 
with no distinction; 
Whereas Articles 19 and 20 of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and Articles 2, 14, and 26 of the Inter-
national Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ensure 
freedom of expression and freedom of association for all 
individuals; 
Whereas globally, including in some countries in Europe and 
Eurasia, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and 
intersex (referred to in this resolution as ‘‘LGBTQI+’’) 
communities have faced increasingly hostile environ-
ments, fueled by increasing democratic backsliding and 
discriminatory rhetoric by politicians across the region; 
Whereas some European countries are considered to have 
among the world’s strongest rights and protections for 
LGBTQI+ persons, and a number of other countries in 
Europe and Eurasia have made progress in expanding 
rights and protections for LGBTQI+ persons, despite 
continuing challenges in the region; 
Whereas the right to equal treatment and nondiscrimination 
is enshrined in the Charter of the Fundamental Rights 
of the European Union, the Treaty on European Union, 
and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European 
Union; 
Whereas the 47 member states of the Council of Europe 
agreed in 2010 to a Recommendation from its Committee

•HRES 470 IH 
of Ministers on measures to combat discrimination on the 
grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity; 
Whereas some countries in Europe and Eurasia do not explic-
itly include sexual orientation, sex characteristics, or gen-
der identity and expression as protected grounds in anti-
discrimination laws, and as a result place marginalized 
populations in danger of discrimination and violence; 
Whereas in many countries in Europe and Eurasia 
LGBTQI+ 
communities 
that 
already 
face 
marginalization have experienced increased levels of 
homelessness 
and 
economic 
insecurity 
during 
the 
COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas hate speech and online and physical abuse against 
LGBTQI+ communities in Europe and Eurasia have 
been exacerbated by the COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas European and multinational organizations lack sys-
tematic monitoring, documentation, and data collection 
surrounding hate crimes against LGBTQI+ identifying 
individuals and concerning violence against LGBTQI+ 
communities; 
Whereas many governments at either the national or regional 
level, including in Turkey, Poland, and Hungary munic-
ipal governments, have taken actions that curtail the 
rights of or negatively target LGBTQI+ people; 
Whereas Polish local governments in the form of regional, 
county, or municipal governing bodies have passed resolu-
tions declaring themselves to be ‘‘LGBT-Free Zones’’ or 
‘‘free from LGBT Ideology’’; 
Whereas expressions of bigotry and hostility by authorities 
may result in increased acts of violence and hate crimes 
against LGBTQI+ individuals;

•HRES 470 IH 
Whereas LGBTQI+ people have faced increasing violence 
from which authorities have not protected them, includ-
ing violence against participants in pride parades; 
Whereas, in many countries, antitrans rhetoric has been 
linked to an increase in transphobic hate crimes over the 
past several years, including multiple murders of 
transgender individuals in Europe and Eurasia in recent 
years; 
Whereas opposition to trans rights has grown in much of Eu-
rope and Eurasia, in some cases causing a regression in 
legal gender recognition policies; 
Whereas legal gender recognition has stagnated or reversed, 
with some countries withdrawing or restricting the right 
to legal gender recognition in law, including to various 
degrees in Hungary, Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan; 
Whereas in some instances authorities across Europe and 
Eurasia have failed to classify hate crimes committed 
against LGBTQI+ individuals as such, including murder, 
other acts of violence, and extortion; 
Whereas government officials in Hungary and Poland have 
used anti-LGBTQI+ rhetoric in the political sphere, 
which civil society groups have linked to an increase in 
violence against LGBTQI+ identifying people, as well as 
introduced legislative actions that have limited the rights 
of LGBTQI+ people; 
Whereas Russian President Vladimir Putin has stated that he 
will not introduce marriage equality in the Russian Fed-
eration as long as he remains in power; 
Whereas Russian authorities have imposed fines on Russian 
citizens, prohibited rallies and performances, and blocked 
websites on the basis of a 2013 law banning ‘‘propa-

ganda’’ to minors about ‘‘non-traditional sexual relation-
ships’’; 
Whereas in the Chechen Republic of the Russian Federation, 
authorities in 2017 and again in the winter of 2018– 
2019 detained and tortured gay men in a campaign of 
arrests, torture, and extrajudicial executions in what has 
since become known as the ‘‘gay purge’’; 
Whereas, in February of 2020, journalist Elena Milashina, 
who first reported on the ‘‘gay purge’’ in Chechnya, was 
attacked by what appeared to be an organized mob in the 
Chechen capital of Grozny and was later the target of a 
death threat delivered on Instagram by Ramzan Kadyrov, 
the leader of the Chechen Republic; 
Whereas the United States and European Union have sanc-
tioned two Russian officials in Chechnya for their role in 
the persecution of LGBTQI+ identifying people in the 
region; 
Whereas the severity of these attacks prompted the United 
States and 15 other countries to support the appointment 
of an Organization for Security and Co-operation in Eu-
rope rapporteur in 2018 to examine gross violations of 
human rights, torture, extrajudicial killings, forced dis-
appearances, and impunity; 
Whereas, despite significant difficulties, many governments in 
European and Eurasian countries have made positive 
progress toward LGBTQI+ equality and human rights in 
recent years; 
Whereas many countries in Europe and Eurasia allow same- 
sex marriage and same-sex civil unions, including Monte-
negro which in 2020 became the first Western Balkan 
country to legalize same-sex civil partnership;

Whereas, in 2020, a court in Turkey reversed a previous ban 
on pride parades in the country; 
Whereas, on March 11, 2021, the European Parliament 
passed a resolution declaring an ‘‘LGBTIQ Freedom 
Zone’’ in response to concerning developments related to 
the human rights situation for LGBTQI+ communities 
in the European Union; and 
Whereas the United States and its transatlantic allies and 
partners must explore avenues for cooperation in support 
of the human rights, civil rights, social rights, and eco-
nomic rights of LGBTQI+ identifying people and in 
building coalitions in support of equality in the United 
States, Europe, Eurasia, and across the world: Now,
