RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the designation of the week beginning 
March 6, 2022, as ‘‘School Social Work Week’’. 
Whereas the importance of school social work through the in-
clusion of school social work programs and services has

cation Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.) and the In-
dividuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 
1400 et seq.);

Whereas school social workers are needed more now than at 
any time in recent memory, as more students are strug-
gling with mental and behavioral health disorders, with 
nearly 1 in 6 children from 2 to 8 years old (17.4 per-
cent) having a diagnosed mental, behavioral, or develop-
mental disorder; 
Whereas individuals who wish to access community mental 
health services often find such services unavailable, inac-
cessible, or inadequate; 
Whereas school-based mental health programs are critical to 
early identification of and early intervention for mental 
health problems; 
Whereas school social workers, being licensed mental health 
professionals in schools in the United States, provide nec-
essary assessment, interventions, counseling, family out-
reach, and community referrals; 
Whereas school mental health programs are critical to early 
identification of mental health problems and in the provi-
sion of appropriate services when needed; 
Whereas school social workers maintain knowledge of school 
culture and school climate which are necessary for re-
sponsible school safety planning; 
Whereas fewer than 1 in 5 children in need of mental health 
services actually receive these services, and research indi-
cates that school mental health programs improve edu-
cational outcomes by decreasing absences, dropout rates, 
and discipline referrals, while improving academic 
achievement; 
Whereas school social workers serve as vital members of a 
school’s education team, playing a central role in creating
