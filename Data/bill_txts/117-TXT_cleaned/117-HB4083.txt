Congress finds the following:

•HR 4083 IH
(1) Corey Jones of Lake Worth, Florida, was 
1
shot and killed by a plainclothes law enforcement of-
2
ficer operating an unmarked vehicle on October 18, 
3
2015. 
4
(2) Mr. Jones was legally and peacefully pulled 
5
to the side of the road while he awaited roadside as-
6
sistance at approximately 3 a.m. in the morning be-
7
cause his car had broken down. 
8
(3) While Mr. Jones awaited roadside assist-
9
ance, he was approached by a law enforcement offi-
10
cer driving an unmarked van and dressed in plain-
11
clothes. 
12
(4) Mr. Jones would not have had any reason-
13
able reason to believe that the person in plainclothes 
14
driving the unmarked vehicle was a law enforcement 
15
officer. 
16
(5) Any confusion as to the nature of the law 
17
enforcement officer’s interaction with Mr. Jones 
18
could likely have been avoided had a uniformed offi-
19
cer in a marked vehicle been called to the scene. 
20
(6) Tragic incidents like the death of Mr. Jones 
21
can easily be avoided by prohibiting law enforcement 
22
officers in plainclothes or law enforcement officers in 
23
plainclothes and unmarked vehicles from engaging in 
24
routine traffic stops.
