RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for designation of the third Friday of 
every March, as ‘‘National FIRST Robotics Day’’. 
Whereas FIRST is For the Inspiration and Recognition of 
Science and Technology; 
Whereas robotics is rapidly proving to be one of the most ef-
fective, compelling, and engaging means for teaching and 
reinforcing fundamental science, technology, engineering, 
and mathematics (STEM) concepts as well as inspiring 
the Nation’s youth to pursue STEM-related careers, 
thereby helping to create a highly skilled, 21st-century 
American workforce;

Whereas there is a strong need to recognize America’s leader-
ship in robotics technology, educate the public on robotics 
technology’s broad potential, growing importance, and fu-
ture impact on American society, underscore the need for 
increased investment in robotics technology research and 
development, and inspire the Nation’s youth to pursue 
careers in robotics and other STEM-related fields; 
Whereas the United States has the largest number of aca-
demic and research organizations with dedicated pro-
grams focused on the advancement of robotics tech-
nology; 
Whereas aptitude in mathematics, science, and engineering is 
essential for a knowledge-based society; 
Whereas the Federal Government must continue to make 
deep, hands-on STEM experiences a true priority in 
school districts around the country by unlocking in-
creased funding for programming that— 
(1) builds strong foundations for STEM literacy; 
(2) increases diversity, equity, and inclusion in 
STEM; and 
(3) prepares the STEM workforce for the future; 
Whereas not all STEM jobs of the 21st century require a tra-
ditional 4-year degree, so greater pathways toward 
STEM education must be encouraged; 
Whereas robotics has matured into an all-encompassing and 
enabling technology that, as a pillar of 21st-century 
American innovation, is positioned to fuel a broad array 
of next generation products and applications, and trans-
form our society; 
Whereas the emerging market for robotics and related tech-
nology in various sectors, including health care, national

defense, homeland security, energy, manufacturing, logis-
tics, transportation, agriculture, education, consumer 
goods, and others, is expected to grow at a compound an-
nual growth rate of nearly 20 percent over the next few 
years to become a worldwide $27,000,000,000 industry; 
and 
Whereas robotics is a critical technology capable in the near 
term of contributing to the economic recovery by creating 
new jobs, increasing productivity, improving quality, and 
increasing worker safety: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the designation of a ‘‘National 
2
FIRST Robotics Day’’ and its celebration around 
3
the United States; 
4
(2) recognizes the continuing importance of the 
5
National Science Foundation’s math and science 
6
education programs; 
7
(3) encourages States and local educational 
8
agencies to fund afterschool robotics programs using 
9
funds made available by title IV, part A of the Every 
10
Student Succeeds Act; and 
11
(4) encourages schools and educators to observe 
12
the day with appropriate activities that teach stu-
13
dents about robotics and engage them about the 
14
study of mathematics and science.
