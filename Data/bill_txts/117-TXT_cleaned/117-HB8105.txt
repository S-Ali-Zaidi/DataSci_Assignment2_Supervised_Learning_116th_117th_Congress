SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Good Jobs for Good 
2
Airports Act’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSES. 
4
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) Safe and effective airport operations are es-
6
sential to national commerce and the general wel-
7
fare. 
8
(2) A well-trained, stable workforce at our Na-
9
tion’s airports is critical to ensuring public safety 
10
and security, as well as the health and safety of the 
11
public and protection from infectious diseases. 
12
(3) The Federal Government has invested bil-
13
lions of dollars in creating and maintaining our Na-
14
tion’s aviation infrastructure, reflecting the national 
15
interest in maintaining airports across the country. 
16
(4) Airport services are most effective when the 
17
workforce providing those services is able to earn a 
18
living wage and able to secure adequate health ben-
19
efit coverage. In fact, meeting the growing chal-
20
lenges of operating airports securely and efficiently 
21
requires the recruitment and retention of excellent 
22
staff in all of the classifications of employees who 
23
work in airport services and operations. 
24
(5) Effective management of airports and effec-
25
tive airport security requires that workforce turnover 
26
23:06 Jun 22, 2022
H8105
3 
•HR 8105 IH
be reduced and that the workforce be highly trained 
1
and highly motivated. 
2
(6) In connection with setting workplace stand-
3
ards for those engaged in airport services, there is 
4
a need to establish an orderly system that reconciles 
5
competing interests without undue disruption. 
6
(b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this Act are— 
7
(1) to provide a mechanism for ensuring min-
8
imum workplace standards for individuals who work 
9
in airports whose operators are grantees of Federal 
10
assistance or derive revenue from fees authorized by 
11
the Federal Government; and 
12
(2) to serve the best interests of the people of 
13
the United States by stabilizing the workplace condi-
14
tions of the labor pool that supports our Nation’s 
15
airport operations.
