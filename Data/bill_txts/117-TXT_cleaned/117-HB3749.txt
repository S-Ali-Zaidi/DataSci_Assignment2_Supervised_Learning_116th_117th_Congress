A BILL 
To amend title XXVII of the Public Health Service Act

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Katherine’s Law for 
4
Lung Cancer Early Detection and Survival Act of 2021’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

7
(1) Lung cancer is the number 1 killer of all 
8
cancers.

(2) Lung cancer causes more deaths than pros-
1
tate cancer, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer 
2
combined. 
3
(3) The reason for the extremely low 5-year 
4
survival rate in lung cancer patients is the difficulty 
5
to find it at early stages (as patients have no symp-
6
toms at early stages). 
7
(4) For all stages of lung cancer, the overall 5- 
8
year survival rate is 19 percent, while such rate is 
9
98 percent for prostate cancer and 90 percent for 
10
breast cancer (all stages). 
11
(5) Early detection of lung cancer through 
12
screening could dramatically increase survival rates 
13
for patients.
