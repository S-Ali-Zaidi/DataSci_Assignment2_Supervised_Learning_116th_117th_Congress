monitoring, detection, diagnosis, treatment, and re-
11
habilitation, including through the following activi-
12
ties: 
13
(A) The establishment of a program to 
14
monitor cognitive brain health across the De-
15
partment of Defense, with the goal of detecting 
16
any need for cognitive enhancement or restora-
17
tion resulting from potential brain exposures of 
18
members of Armed Forces, to mitigate possible 
19
evolution of injury or disease progression. 
20
(B) The identification and dissemination of 
21
thresholds for blast pressure safety and associ-
22
ated emerging scientific evidence.

(D) The identification of individuals who 
4
perform high-risk training or occupational ac-
5
tivities, for purposes of increased monitoring of 
6
the brain health of such individuals.

8
ing of non-invasive, portable, point-of-care med-
9
ical devices, to inform the diagnosis and treat-
10
ment of traumatic brain injury.

(F) The establishment of a standardized 
12
monitoring program that documents and ana-
13
lyzes blast exposures that may affect the brain 
14
health of members of the Armed Forces. 
15
(G) The consideration of the findings and 
16
recommendations of the report of the National 
17
Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medi-
18
cine titled ‘‘Traumatic Brain Injury: A Road-
19
map for Accelerating Progress’’ and published 
20
in 2022 (relating to the acceleration of progress 
21
in traumatic brain injury research and care), or 
22
any successor report, in relation to the activities 
23
of the Department relating to brain health, as 
24
