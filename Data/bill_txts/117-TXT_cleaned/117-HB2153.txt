23
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
24
23:02 May 19, 2021
H2153
158 
•HR 2153 IH
(1) Widespread use of standards facilitates 
1
technology advancement by defining and establishing 
2
common foundations for product differentiation, 
3
technological innovation, and other value-added serv-
4
ices. 
5
(2) Standards also promote an expanded, more 
6
interoperable, and efficient marketplace. 
7
(3) Global cooperation and coordination on 
8
standards for emerging technologies will be critical 
9
for having a consistent set of rules to enable market 
10
competition, preclude barriers to trade, and allow in-
11
novation to flourish. 
12
(4) China’s ‘‘Standardization Reform Plan’’ 
13
and ‘‘Five-Year Plan for Standardization’’ highlight 
14
its high-level goals to establish China as a ‘‘stand-
15
ards power’’ by 2020, participate in at least half of 
16
all standards drafting and revision efforts in recog-
17
nized international standards setting organizations, 
18
and to strengthen China’s participation in the gov-
19
ernance of international standards setting organiza-
20
tions. 
21
(5) As emerging technologies develop for global 
22
deployment, it is critical that the Unite States and 
23
its allies continue to shape standards that underpin 
24
23:02 May 19, 2021

•HR 2153 IH
the technologies themselves, and the future inter-
1
national governance of these technologies. 
2
(6) United States position on standardization in 
3
emerging technologies will be critical to United 
4
States economic competitiveness. 
5
(7) NIST is in a unique position to strengthen 
6
United States leadership in standards development, 
7
particularly for emerging technologies, to ensure 
8
continuing United States economic competitiveness 
9
and national security. 
10
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
11
gress that— 
12
(1) while United States experts have historically 
13
been leaders in international standards development 
14
activities, there is concern that the United States is 
15
losing its edge; 
16
(2) strengthening the unique United States 
17
public-private partnerships approach to standards 
18
development is critical to United States economic 
19
competitiveness; and 
20
(3) the United States Government should en-
21
sure cooperation and coordination across Federal 
22
agencies to partner with and support private sector

SEC. 605. NEXT GENERATION DIGITAL RADAR. 
12
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that— 
13
(1) the national weather radar network is 
14
aging, and procurement and replacement must begin 
15
by early in the decade commencing with the year 
16
2030; 
17
(2) research by the National Oceanic and At-
18
mospheric Administration on next generation radar 
19
systems has largely focused on the development of a 
20
phased array radar for severe weather forecasting; 
21
(3) a phased array radar system can achieve 
22
precise measurements of precipitation rates and con-
23
ditions through a rapid scan of the atmosphere to

reveal critical weather thumbprints that point to the 
1
potential of severe weather; 
2
(4) though initially established through the 
3
joint collaboration between the Federal Aviation Ad-
4
ministration and the National Oceanic and Atmos-
5
pheric Administration, the potential for use of the 
6
phased array radar for severe weather observations 
7
has emerged as the focus; 
8
(5) lifetime operations and maintenance costs 
9
will be significantly reduced due to the simple, dig-
10
ital process for updating the digital array radar sys-
11
tem; and 
12
(6) the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Ad-
13
ministration must continue to conduct crucial tech-
14
nical risk reduction research to be ready for the next 
15
generation of radar networks. 
16
(b) PROGRAM.—The Under Secretary shall develop, 
17
in collaboration with the Assistant Administrators for 
18
Weather Services and Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, 
19
and utilizing NOAA’s existing academic partners for im-
20
plementation, a technical risk reduction program, that will 
21
lead to the baseline requirements to procure an all-digital 
22
ground based phased array radar system for initial deploy-
23
ment by no later than 2032. At a minimum, such a pro-
24
gram must demonstrate the ability to significantly im-

2
(c) PROGRAM ELEMENTS.—The program described 
3
in subsection (b) shall focus on the following activities: 
4
(1) Definition of key system requirements need-
5
ed to cost effectively lead to significantly improve 
6
weather forecasting accuracy and precision through 
7
a nationwide all-digital ground based phased array 
8
weather radar system. 
9
(2) Identification of critical technologies and 
10
subsystems on the critical path to the development 
11
of an all-digital phased array system, and an invest-
12
ment schedule to reduce risk in each designated 
13
area. 
14
(3) Development of a full-scale digital phased 
15
array radar demonstrator that will meet require-
16
ments set in paragraph (1). 
17
(4) Development of a multi-year effort to 
18
strengthen ties between NOAA and its public univer-
19
sity based academic partners so as to maintain an 
20
ongoing reservoir of science and technology talent to 
21
help to guide and advise Federal program managers 
22
on the implementation and use of an all-digital 
23
phased array radar system.

(1) Many reports over the past decade have 
23
found that it is critical to our Nation’s economic 
24
leadership and global competitiveness that the 
25

204 
•HR 2153 IH
United States educates and trains more scientists 
1
and engineers. 
2
(2) Worldwide demand for STEM-capable 
3
workers keeps growing, driven by international op-
4
portunities and competition, and by the rapid in-
5
creases in the number of jobs that require STEM 
6
skills, including in lines of work that historically did 
7
not require STEM knowledge. 
8
(3) By 2026 science and engineering jobs are 
9
predicted to grow by 13 percent compared with 7 
10
percent growth in the overall United States work-
11
force. 
12
(4) A recent report by ACT, the scholastic test-
13
ing service, found that only 20 percent of United 
14
States students in the 2016 ACT-tested high school 
15
graduating class were ready for first-year STEM 
16
college courses.

20

14
cluding researchers, practitioners, industry, and 
15

14
UPDATE. 
15
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
16
(1) The National Science Foundation Graduate 
17
Research Fellowship Program is the nation’s oldest 
18
fellowship program that directly supports American 
19
graduate students in various STEM fields and is a 
20
model for training the best innovators in the United 
21
States. 
22
(2) Since 1952, NSF has funded over 50,000 
23
Graduate Research Fellowships out of more than 
24
500,000 applicants, 42 Fellows have gone on to be-

(3) Foreign nations are increasingly investing 
3
in foreign talent programs to compete with the 
4
United States. 
5
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
6
gress that the National Science Foundation should grow 
7
the number of new graduate research fellows supported 
8
annually over the next 10 years to no less than 3,000 fel-
9
lows.
