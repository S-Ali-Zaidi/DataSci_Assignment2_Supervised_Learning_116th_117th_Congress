A BILL 
To impose sanctions with respect to Communist Chinese 
military and surveillance companies. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Chinese Military and 
4
Surveillance Company Sanctions Act of 2021’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
6
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Under Executive Order 13959 (85 Fed. 
8
Reg. 73185; relating to addressing the threat from

securities investments that finance Communist Chi-
1
nese military companies) of November 17, 2020, the 
2
President found that the People’s Republic of China 
3
‘‘increases the size of the country’s military-indus-
4
trial complex by compelling civilian Chinese compa-
5
nies to support its military and intelligence activi-
6
ties. Those companies, though remaining ostensibly 
7
private and civilian, directly support the PRC’s mili-
8
tary, intelligence, and security apparatuses and aid 
9
in their development and modernization.’’. The 
10
President further determined that ‘‘the PRC exploits 
11
United States investors to finance the development 
12
and modernization of its military.’’. As a result, Ex-
13
ecutive Order 13959 restricted transactions in pub-
14
licly traded securities of Communist Chinese military 
15
companies listed pursuant to section 1237 of the 
16
Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization 
17
Act for Fiscal Year 1999 (50 U.S.C. 1701 note). 
18
(2) Although Executive Order 13959 targets 
19
transactions in public securities, it does not address 
20
financing options for Communist Chinese military 
21
companies through other forms of equity financing 
22
or debt financing, nor does it limit transactions with 
23
United States persons that may generate earnings in 
24
a manner that facilitates company growth.

(3) Transaction restrictions pursuant to Execu-
1
tive Order 13959 have not withstood challenges in 
2
court. On March 12, 2021, the United States Dis-
3
trict Court for the District of Columbia granted a 
4
preliminary injunction preventing the application of 
5
Executive Order 13959 to Xiaomi Corporation, 
6
which the Department of Defense had listed as a 
7
Communist Chinese military company, based on the 
8
‘‘high likelihood of success on the merits’’ that the 
9
listing did not conform to the Administrative Proce-
10
dures Act and exceeded the authority granted under 
11
section 1237 of the Strom Thurmond National De-
12
fense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999. The 
13
Department of Defense chose not to challenge the 
14
ruling and removed the company from its listing. 
15
(4) On May 5, 2021, the District Court further 
16
enjoined the implementation of Executive Order 
17
13959 with respect to Luokung Technology Corp., 
18
which the Department of Defense had originally 
19
sought to list on January 14, 2021, and re-listed on 
20
March 9, 2021. Consequently, the prohibitions of 
21
Executive Order 13959 could not be applied to the 
22
company.

(5) The Office of Foreign Assets Control 
24
(OFAC) of the Department of the Treasury, by im-

posing asset blocking through the Specially Des-
1
ignated Nationals (SDN) List, is able to forbid vir-
2
tually any transaction between United States per-
3
sons and a designated entity, including debt and eq-
4
uity financing, the exchange of goods and services, 
5
and the provision of material or technological sup-
6
port. Conversely, restrictions limited to publicly trad-
7
ed securities are less comprehensive, and in the case 
8
of certain Chinese companies of concern, may be ir-
9
relevant if the companies do not issue such securi-
10
ties. 
11
(6) While restrictions on public securities are 
12
restricted to the dealings of United States persons, 
13
OFAC’s inclusion of a foreign entity on the SDN list 
14
deters third-country persons from dealing with a 
15
designated entity, amplifying the effects of United 
16
States sanctions globally. 
17
(7) OFAC has long devoted significant re-
18
sources to compiling evidence on SDNs that rou-
19
tinely withstand challenges in court, which enhances 
20
the effectiveness of United States sanctions, encour-
21
ages allies to consider comparable measures, and 
22
strengthens national security. 
23
(8) On June 3, 2021, the President issued Ex-
24
ecutive Order 14032, which transferred responsi-
25

bility for naming Chinese military companies subject 
1
to investment restrictions to the Secretary of the 
2
Treasury, and expanded restrictions to entities oper-
3
ating in the surveillance technology sector of the 
4
Chinese economy. 
5
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of the 
6
Congress that the national emergency declared under Ex-
7
ecutive Order 13959 calls for the President to— 
8
(1) more fully cut off financing avenues for 
9
Communist Chinese military and surveillance compa-
10
nies; 
11
(2) prevent adaptation by a company to partial 
12
restrictions that limit themselves to publicly traded 
13
securities; 
14
(3) ensure that the United States assembles an 
15
appropriate evidentiary basis to support the effec-
16
tiveness of sanctions; 
17
(4) enhance the impact of economic sanctions 
18
by deterring third-country persons from dealing with 
19
the companies; and 
20
(5) link the imposition of sanctions to clear ob-
21
jectives that serve to resolve the national emergency.
