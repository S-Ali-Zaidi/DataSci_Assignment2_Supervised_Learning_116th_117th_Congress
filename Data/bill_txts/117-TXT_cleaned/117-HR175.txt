RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives 
regarding United States arms transfers to Saudi Arabia. 
Whereas the United States and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 
have traditionally had a close partnership based on mu-
tual interests, information sharing, economic develop-
ment, educational exchange, and other cooperation; 
Whereas, on October 2, 2018, Saudi Government officials 
murdered and dismembered the body of United States 
resident 
and 
Washington 
Post 
columnist 
Jamal 
Khashoggi when he visited the Saudi Consulate in 
Istanbul, Turkey;

Whereas Khashoggi, himself a former Saudi official, had 
peacefully voiced criticism of recent decisions made by 
the Saudi Government, in particular those of Crown 
Prince Mohammed bin Salman; 
Whereas credible news media outlets have reported that the 
Central Intelligence Agency and other elements of the 
United States intelligence community have concluded that 
Mohammed bin Salman is responsible for ordering 
Khashoggi’s assassination; 
Whereas, in June 2019, United Nations Special Rapporteur 
on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Killings, Agnes 
Callamard, 
issued 
a 
report 
concluding 
that 
Mr. 
Khashoggi’s murder ‘‘constituted an extrajudicial killing 
for which the State of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is 
responsible’’ and ‘‘determined that there is credible evi-
dence, warranting further investigation of high-level 
Saudi Officials’ individual liability, including the Crown 
Prince’s’’; 
Whereas Saudi Arabia has convicted eight unidentified indi-
viduals in the Khashoggi murder, five of whom were 
originally sentenced to death but whose sentences were 
commuted, and none of whom are Mohammed bin 
Salman or any other senior official, for their involvement 
in the murder; 
Whereas section 1277 and section 5714 of the National De-
fense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 (Public 
Law 116–92) required the Director of National Intel-
ligence to submit an unclassified report to Congress with-
in 30 days identifying those complicit in or responsible 
for the death of Jamal Khashoggi, and as of January 
2021 no such report has been submitted;

Whereas, in January 2021, Director of National Intelligence 
Avril Haines committed in testimony before the Senate 
Select Committee on Intelligence to follow the law with 
regard to requirements of section 1277 and section 5714 
of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal 
Year 2020 (Public Law 116–92); 
Whereas other Saudi plots to allegedly assassinate or kidnap 
dissidents with an extrajudicial ‘‘Tiger Squad’’ have re-
portedly been uncovered in Canada and Norway, and Mo-
hammed bin Salman’s lawyers are seeking immunity for 
the prince in a related case before the United States judi-
ciary; 
Whereas Saudi Arabia’s efforts to spy on dissidents and other 
individuals perceived as threats reportedly extends to the 
country’s use of Twitter employees as spies and the hack-
ing of prominent private individuals’ cell phones in at-
tempts to extort them; 
Whereas a number of Saudi nationals alleged to have com-
mitted crimes in the United States have escaped justice 
by absconding to Saudi Arabia, reportedly with the help 
of the Saudi Government; 
Whereas the Saudi Government had unjustly detained Amer-
ican citizens Bader al-Ibrahim and Salah al-Haidar on 
political charges before conditionally releasing them pend-
ing trial and convicted Walid Fitaihi for supposed crimes 
such as illegally obtaining United States citizenship be-
fore reducing his sentence and conditionally releasing 
him, subjected them to torture and solitary confinement, 
and banned their families from leaving the kingdom, in-
cluding Fitaihi’s wife and six children who are United 
States citizens and Haidar’s mother, Aziza al-Yousef, a 
United States permanent resident and women’s rights ac-

tivist who was conditionally released from unjust deten-
tion in 2019; 
Whereas Saudi Arabia’s Specialized Criminal Court, estab-
lished in 2008, has been used as a tool of repression to 
try, convict, and punish journalists, human rights defend-
ers, political activists, writers, religious clerics, and wom-
en’s rights activists under dubious antiterrorism and alle-
giance laws; 
Whereas activists Loujain al-Hathloul, Nassima al-Sada, 
Nouf Abdulaziz, Maya’a al-Zahrani, and Samar Badawi 
were among those unjustly arrested in Saudi Arabia in 
2018 after advocating for women’s right to drive and an 
end to the male guardianship system, and some report-
edly have been subjected to harassment, assaults, and 
torture while in prison; 
Whereas Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have 
conducted more than 22,000 airstrikes since the start of 
the conflict in Yemen six years ago, and that conflict has 
caused the deaths of over 233,000 people from both di-
rect hostilities and indirect causes such as hunger and 
lack of health services; 
Whereas the United Kingdom’s House of Commons deter-
mined that its country’s Ministry of Defense had identi-
fied over 500 Saudi-led coalition airstrikes that violated 
international humanitarian law, including by targeting ci-
vilian sites and claiming civilian lives; 
Whereas the risk posed by coalition airstrikes to Yemeni civil-
ians will only continue until there is a negotiated settle-
ment to the conflict in Yemen; 
Whereas S.J.Res. 38, a joint resolution to block a proposed 
emergency sale of defense articles to Saudi Arabia and

other countries, passed both the House and Senate with 
bipartisan support in the 116th Congress but was vetoed 
by the President; 
Whereas the nuclear agreement entered into pursuant to sec-
tion 123 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 
2153) and signed between the United States and the 
United Arab Emirates in 2009 provides a model for rea-
sonable safeguards on nuclear cooperation with a country 
in the region, including termination if the United Arab 
Emirates ‘‘engages in activities within its territory relat-
ing to enrichment of uranium or reprocessing of nuclear 
fuel’’; 
Whereas the United States and Saudi Arabia signed a memo-
randum of understanding concerning peaceful nuclear co-
operation in 2008, but since that time, further negotia-
tions have stalled, with no Section 123 Agreement having 
been presented to Congress; and 
Whereas, in May 2018, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stat-
ed in testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee with regard to Saudi Arabia, that ‘‘we want 
a gold-standard Section 123 Agreement from them, 
which would not permit them to enrich’’ uranium: Now, 
therefore, be it
