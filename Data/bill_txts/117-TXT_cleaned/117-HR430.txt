RESOLUTION 
Supporting the designation of May 21, 2021, as 
‘‘Endangered Species Day’’. 
Whereas plants and wildlife provide incalculable services for 
humankind, including health, cultural, economic, rec-
reational, and spiritual benefits, among others; 
Whereas, in the United States and around the world, more 
than 2,300 species are recognized as at risk of extinction 
now or in the foreseeable future, and many more are ex-
periencing declines in populations and future viability; 
Whereas the planet is experiencing a biodiversity crisis, which 
many scientists conclude is the sixth mass extinction 
event, with plant and wildlife species across the globe fac-
ing heightened risk of extinction that is largely driven by 
human activity;

Whereas climate change, large-scale changes in land use, and 
habitat destruction pose existential threats to species; 
Whereas the United States has prioritized the conservation 
and recovery of imperiled species by enacting the Endan-
gered Species Act of 1973 and other landmark conserva-
tion statutes; 
Whereas conservation and protection efforts implemented 
under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 have success-
fully prevented the extinction of more than 99 percent of 
species designated as threatened or endangered, including 
the critically imperiled California condor, whooping crane, 
and black-footed ferret; 
Whereas many at-risk species have significant cultural and 
subsistence values to Tribal, indigenous, and Native Alas-
kan communities, whose Tribal leadership, ancestral 
lands, and traditional ecological knowledge play an in-
valuable role in species conservation and recovery; 
Whereas Americans have the opportunity to stem threats to 
endangered and threatened species by enacting and im-
plementing bold policies and conservation initiatives, in-
cluding conserving at least 30 percent each of our Na-
tion’s lands and waters by the year 2030; and 
Whereas the recovery of species under the Endangered Spe-
cies Act of 1973 is a remarkable success that should be 
celebrated: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the designation of ‘‘Endangered 
2
Species Day’’;

(2) recognizes the intrinsic value of plants and
