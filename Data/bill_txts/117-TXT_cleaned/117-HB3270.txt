‘‘(b) RULE MAKING CONSIDERATIONS.—In a rule

making, an agency shall make all preliminary and final 
2
factual determinations based on evidence and consider, in

addition to other applicable considerations, the following: 
4
‘‘(1) The legal authority under which a rule 
5
may be proposed, including whether a rule making

7
cific date, or whether the agency has discretion to 
8
commence a rule making.

to whether the agency can or should propose a rule 
11
or undertake other agency action.

‘‘(3) The specific nature and significance of the 
13
problem the agency may address with a rule (includ-
14
ing the degree and nature of risks the problem poses 
15
and the priority of addressing those risks compared 
16
to other matters or activities within the agency’s ju-
17
risdiction), whether the problem warrants new agen-
18
cy action, and the countervailing risks that may be 
19
posed by alternatives for new agency action.

‘‘(4) Whether existing rules have created or 
21
contributed to the problem the agency may address 
22
with a rule and whether those rules could be amend-
23
ed or rescinded to address the problem in whole or 
24
