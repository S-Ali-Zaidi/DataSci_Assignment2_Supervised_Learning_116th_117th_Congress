‘‘SEC. 1441. FINDINGS.

‘‘The Congress finds the following: 
9
‘‘(1) Nationally, only 85 percent of students 
10
graduate from high school with a regular high school 
11
diploma. 
12
‘‘(2) Every school year, 523,000 American high 
13
school students drop out without earning a high 
14
school diploma or an alternative credential. 
15
‘‘(3) Only about 67 percent of American stu-
16
dents with limited English proficiency graduated on 
17
time from high school. 
18
‘‘(4) Only about 79 percent of Black students, 
19
81 percent of Hispanic students, and 74 percent of 
20
American Indian/Alaska Native students graduate 
21
on time from high school with a regular diploma,

‘‘(5) Only about 67 percent of American stu-
1
dents with disabilities graduated on time from high 
2
school.

‘‘(6) High school is the final transition into 
4
adulthood and the world of work as students begin 
5
defining their independence and forging their own 
6
pathways. As our next generation of leaders, our 
7
youth, are deciding their futures, they are faced with 
8
many challenges, including peer pressure and bul-
9
lying, high-stakes testing, the challenges of college 
10
admissions, the scholarship and financial aid appli-
11
cation process, and entrance into an ever more com-
12
petitive job market. Students need guidance and 
13
skills to help them navigate these complex decisions, 
14
which have serious and life changing consequences. 
15
‘‘(7) School counseling programs are essential 
16
for students to achieve optimal personal growth, ac-
17
quire positive social skills and values, set appropriate 
18
career goals, and realize full academic potential to 
19
become productive, contributing members of the 
20
world community. 
21
‘‘(8) Professional secondary school counselors 
22
are highly qualified educators with a mental health 
23
perspective who understand and respond to the chal-

lenges presented by today’s diverse student popu-

‘‘(9) The professional secondary school coun-
3
selor holds a master’s degree or higher in school 
4
counseling (or the substantial equivalent), and is 
5
certified or licensed by the State in which the coun-
6
selor works. 
7
‘‘(10) Professional secondary school counselors 
8
are integral to the total educational program. They 
9
provide proactive leadership that engages all stake-
10
holders in the delivery of programs and services to 
11
help the student achieve success in school. Profes-
12
sional secondary school counselors align and work 
13
with the school’s mission to support the academic 
14
achievement of all students as they prepare for the 
15
ever-changing world of the 21st century. 
16
‘‘(11) Professional secondary school counselors’ 
17
opportunities to assist students are often hindered 
18
by extraordinarily high student-to-counselor ratios. 
19
Currently, the average student-to-counselor ratio in 
20
America’s public schools is 430 to 1. The American 
21
School Counselor Association, the American Coun-
22
seling Association, and the National Association for 
23
College Admissions Counseling all recommend a 
24
ratio of one school counselor to 250 students and a

the student, and may also include meetings with 
17
other relevant individuals, such as a probation offi-
18
cer, mentor, coach, or employer of the student. 
19
‘‘(e) SUPPLEMENT NOT SUPPLANT.—Funds under 
20
this subpart shall be used to supplement, not supplant, 
21

over that second period, the school is eligible to re-
