A BILL 
To provide that no Federal funds shall be appropriated, 
awarded, or granted to the Monterey Bay Aquarium. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Red Listing Monterey

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds as follows: 
7
(1) Lobstering has served as an economic en-
8
gine and family tradition in Maine and the other 
9
New England States for centuries.

(2) The lobster fishery supports thousands of 
1
families who make their livelihoods from catching, 
2
processing, or serving lobsters, employing people of 
3
all ages year-round, with many harvesters beginning 
4
as children and staying in the industry for their en-
5
tire working lives. 
6
(3) Maine’s lobster fishery alone has an esti-
7
mated ex-vessel value of $725,000,000, generating 
8
more than $1,000,000,000 in economic activity and 
9
supporting more than 15,500 jobs throughout the 
10
supply chain. 
11
(4) The Maine lobster industry has spearheaded 
12
sustainability measures for more than 150 years, en-
13
suring the health of the lobster stock and the marine 
14
environment through the following: 
15
(A) In 1872, Maine passed the first law 
16
banning taking of egg-bearing female lobster. 
17
(B) In 1874, Maine passed the first laws 
18
regulating the minimum size of lobster that 
19
could be harvested. 
20
(C) In 1948, Maine passed a requirement 
21
that fishermen mark female, egg-bearing lob-
22
sters with a V-shaped notch. 
23
(D) In 1997, Maine lobstermen removed 
24
all surface floating rope and, in 2009, replaced 
25

•HR 9150 IH
an estimated 27,000 miles of floating line with 
1
whale-safe sinking lines. 
2
(E) In 2015, Maine lobstermen adjusted 
3
their gear in certain areas to a newly required 
4
minimum number of traps per buoy, reducing 
5
the amount of vertical rope present in the water 
6
by an additional 3,000 miles. 
7
(F) In 2022, lobstermen converted their 
8
gear once again, including more ‘‘weak links’’, 
9
more ‘‘weak rope’’ and more traps per buoy to 
10
further reduce vertical line in the water column, 
11
in addition to removing nearly 1,000 miles of 
12
gear from prime fishing grounds. 
13
(5) These measures are the reason why there 
14
has never been a serious injury or death of the en-
15
dangered North Atlantic right whale attributed to 
16
the Maine lobster fishery and there has not been a 
17
known right whale entanglement with Maine lobster 
18
gear since 2004. 
19
(6) According to the National Oceanic and At-
20
mospheric Administration, the majority of known 
21
right whale deaths since 2017 have been attributed 
22
to vessel strikes in Canada and of the 33 right whale 
23
mortalities occurring between 2017 and 2020, 24 of 
24
those whales were confirmed to be attributed to en-
25

•HR 9150 IH
tanglements in Canadian fishing gear and vessel 
1
strikes in Canadian waters. 
2
(7) Despite these facts, Monterey Bay Aquar-
3
ium’s Seafood Watch program added the American 
4
lobster fishery to a ‘‘red list’’ of seafood that con-
5
sumers should avoid due to the risk that the fishery 
6
poses to right whales. 
7
(8) This red list designation for American lob-
8
ster by Seafood Watch is speculative and conjecture, 
9
not supported by the data or the science as they 
10
state in their report, ‘‘until there is more specific in-
11
formation available regarding which fisheries are re-
12
sponsible for the unattributed entanglements, Sea-
13
food Watch considers that all relevant fisheries that 
14
may overlap with North Atlantic right whales pose 
15
risks’’. 
16
(9) In their own press release announcing the 
17
red listing for American lobster, Seafood Watch 
18
states, ‘‘More than 90% of entanglements cannot be 
19
linked to a specific gear type, and only 12% of en-
20
tanglements can be linked to a specific location.’’. 
21
(10) Monterey Bay Aquarium ignores the ef-
22
forts by the lobster industry to reduce their risk to 
23
right whales for the past 150 years, admitting in 
24
03:42 Oct 21, 2022
H9150
5 
•HR 9150 IH
their report that ‘‘effects on mitigation of whale en-
1
tanglement have yet to be determined’’. 
2
(11) This new, unsubstantiated designation has 
3
a real world impact; with the lobster industry al-
4
ready facing challenges, the inaccurate designation 
5
will hurt the thousands of hardworking lobstermen, 
6
their families, and businesses across Maine and has 
7
already prompted seafood retailers such as Blue 
8
Apron and HelloFresh to pull lobster from their 
9
menus. 
10
(12) Monterey Bay’s Seafood Watch Program 
11
has produced recommendations that rely on pseudo-
12
scientific claims and false assumptions that ignore 
13
scientific principles that should underpin any legiti-
14
mate ratings and, by ignoring the facts, Seafood 
15
Watch is not encouraging safe fishing, but rather 
16
damaging the reputation of its certification process 
17
by smearing an entire industry and misleading con-
18
sumers. 
19
(13) Monterey Bay Aquarium receives millions 
20
of Federal taxpayer dollars for scientific research 
21
and to promote ocean conservation and seafood sus-
22
tainability, yet the Monterey Bay Aquarium has irre-
23
sponsibly ignored scientific facts and the lobster 
24
fishery’s history of sustainability.
