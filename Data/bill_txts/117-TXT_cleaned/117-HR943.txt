RESOLUTION 
Condemning and opposing unprovoked invasion and egregious 
act of aggression against sovereign state of Ukraine by 
the Russian Federation. 
Whereas Ukraine was the second-most populous and powerful 
of the 15 republics of the former and disintegrated Union 
of Soviet Socialist Republics and the hub of the Union’s 
agricultural production, defense industries, and military 
arsenal; 
Whereas in the three decades since gaining its independence, 
Ukraine has sought to forge its own path as a sovereign 
state and sought closer economic, social, and political ties 
with the free market and democratic nations of the West;

Whereas, in February 2014, the military of the Russian Fed-
eration, without merit or cause, invaded the eastern part 
of the free and independent country of Ukraine, including 
the Crimean Peninsula, and backed a separatist insur-
gency in the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine, where 
fighting has killed over 14,000 people; 
Whereas the United States, a strategic ally of Ukraine, re-
acted swiftly to the Russian invasion, condemning the 
military action in strong and bipartisan fashion, and pro-
viding military, humanitarian, and nonmilitary financial 
assistance to the determined but beleaguered nation of 
Ukraine, which since 2014 has totaled approximately 
$1.5 billion; 
Whereas, on September 14, 2014, the House of Representa-
tives adopted H. Res. 726, a resolution supporting the 
right of the people of Ukraine to freely determine their 
future, including their country’s relationship with other 
nations and international organizations, without inter-
ference, intimidation, or coercion by other countries, and 
committed itself to solidarity with the people of Ukraine; 
Whereas interference and unprovoked aggressions by the 
Russian Federation ordered and led by Vladimir Putin 
continued unabated, including the mobilization and sta-
tioning of 150,000 Russian troops surrounding Ukraine 
and armed forces positioned in Belarus to attack Ukraine 
from the north, including war planes and offensive mis-
sile systems, and the movement of Russian naval vessels 
in the Black Sea to Ukraine’s south, including amphib-
ious assault ships, missile cruisers, and submarines, and 
the positioning of blood and medical equipment into posi-
tion on their border;

•HRES 943 IH 
Whereas Vladimir Putin sought authorization from the Rus-
sian Parliament to use military force outside of Russian 
territory by staging a fraudulent on-camera meeting of 
his Security Council to grandstand for the Russian public 
and by recognizing sovereign Ukrainian territory as so- 
called independent republics in clear violation, again, of 
international law, all of which was intended to set the 
stage for further pretexts and further provocations by the 
Russian Federation to make further aggressions against 
Ukraine by military action; 
Whereas Vladimir Putin rejected every good-faith effort the 
United States and its allies and partners made to address 
mutual security concerns through dialogue to avoid need-
less conflict and avert human suffering; 
Whereas, on February 23, 2022, the Russian Federation 
military, at the direction of Vladimir Putin, began a pre-
meditated brutal assault on the people of Ukraine with-
out provocation, without justification, and without neces-
sity, making outlandish, false, and baseless claims that 
Ukraine was about to invade and launch a war against 
Russia and that Ukraine was prepared to use chemical 
weapons, and that Ukraine had committed a genocide; 
and 
Whereas these actions were taken by Vladimir Putin at the 
very moment that the United Nations Security Council 
was meeting to stand up for Ukraine’s sovereignty to 
stave off invasion, culminating in missile strikes on his-
toric cities across Ukraine, followed by air raids and the 
invasion of Russian tanks and troops: Now, therefore, be 
it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
