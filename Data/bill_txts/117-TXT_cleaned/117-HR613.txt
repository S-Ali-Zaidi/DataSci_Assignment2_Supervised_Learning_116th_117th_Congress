RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for approximately doubling funding for 
Federal career and technical education programs. 
Whereas for much of the past year, the COVID–19 pandemic 
brought the American economy to a grinding halt, plung-
ing the United States and the world into the worst eco-
nomic downturn since the Great Depression; 
Whereas the American economy is now roaring back to life, 
thanks to historic action by Congress and the President; 
Whereas for many Americans, this post-COVID economic 
boom is an opportunity to reskill and upskill, with Amer-
ican workers changing jobs and even professions in his-
toric numbers; 
Whereas many other Americans continue to have difficulties 
finding work, with more than 9,000,000 unemployed

Americans currently unable to find a job, including 
4,000,000 long-term unemployed; 
Whereas, at the same time, the landscape of the 21st century 
economy is changing, as emerging new technologies and 
shifting demands create new opportunities and chal-
lenges; 
Whereas the infrastructure proposals currently under consid-
eration reflect this new economy, as do the science and 
technology bills put forth in both the House of Rep-
resentatives and the Senate, but there remains a crucial 
and unaddressed need to train the workforce of this new 
economy; 
Whereas, relative to inflation, Federal spending on workforce 
training and employment services is at its lowest level in 
more than 50 years, and funding for community college 
career and technical education has fallen 28 percent in 
the last 20 years alone; 
Whereas now is the time to invest in American workers, as 
high unemployment and historic turnover, combined with 
the tremendous economic energy of the post-COVID re-
covery, present an unparalleled opportunity to retrain 
and realign the American workforce for the new economy, 
while also providing American workers with the necessary 
skills to earn higher wages and attain long-term job secu-
rity; and 
Whereas the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Edu-
cation Act of 2006 (20 U.S.C. 2301 et seq.), as reauthor-
ized by the Strengthening Career and Technical Edu-
cation for the 21st Century Act (‘‘Perkins V’’), is the pri-
mary Federal law developing and supporting career and

technical education programs in secondary and postsec-
ondary education: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) affirms the importance of Perkins V and 
2
other career and technical education programs for 
3
training the skilled workforce of the future and for 
4
increasing the earning potential and job security of 
5
American workers; 
6
(2) recognizes that the annual funding for Per-
7
kins V, amounting to $1,334,800,000 in fiscal year 
8
2021, is insufficient to address the need brought on 
9
by the long-term economic realignment and the 
10
near-term COVID–19 pandemic; and 
11
(3) urges $10,000,000,000 in new spending be 
12
set aside to fund Perkins V programs and innovative 
13
evidence-based career and technical education over 
14
the next 10 years, equaling approximately double the 
15
amount currently appropriated by Congress to such 
16
programs.
