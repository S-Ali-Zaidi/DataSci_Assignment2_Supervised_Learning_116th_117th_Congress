SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Nearly half of the trips taken in the United 
3
States are within a 20-minute bicycle ride, and near-
4
ly a quarter of such trips are within a 20-minute 
5
walk. 
6
(2) Approximately 90 percent of public trans-
7
portation trips are accessible by walking or bicycling. 
8
(3) Communities that invest in active transpor-
9
tation infrastructure experience significant increases 
10
in bicycling and walking rates over time, and such 
11
investments are in strong demand because they lead 
12
to a higher quality of life, better health, a stronger 
13
economy, and increased mobility in communities 
14
where investments are made. 
15
(4) The communities that perform best in en-
16
couraging 
active 
transportation 
create 
inter-
17
connected systems that make it convenient and safe 
18
to travel on foot or by bicycle to destinations on a 
19
routine basis. 
20
(5) Achieving a mode shift to active transpor-
21
tation within a community requires intensive, con-
22
centrated funding of active transportation systems 
23
rather than discrete, piecemeal projects. 
24
(6) Increased use of active transportation re-
25
duces traffic congestion, greenhouse gas emissions, 
26

H2991

•HR 2991 IH
vehicle miles traveled, and rates of obesity and 
1
chronic disease associated with physical inactivity. 
2
(7) Given the contribution that active transpor-
3
tation makes to national policy goals, and the oppor-
4
tunity active transportation provides to accommo-
5
date short trips at the least cost to the public and 
6
individuals, funding of active transportation is one 
7
of the most strategic and cost effective Federal 
8
transportation investments available. 
9
(8) The Federal Government is uniquely quali-
10
fied to facilitate interstate connections necessary to 
11
build long distance active transportation spines and 
12
regional connections in communities that span State 
13
boundaries.
