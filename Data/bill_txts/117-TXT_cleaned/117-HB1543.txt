SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) Despite having one of his Twitter accounts 
7
suspended, the Supreme Leader of Iran, Ayatollah 
8
Ali Khamanei, a Specially Designated Global Ter-
9
rorist by the Department of the Treasury, and the 
10
leader of the world’s leading State Sponsor of Ter-
11
rorism, has multiple social media accounts on Twit-
12
ter and Instagram. The Supreme Leader has used 
13
his accounts to threaten violence against Americans, 
14
support the destruction of the State of Israel, pro-
15
mote conspiracy theories and disinformation regard-
16
ing COVID–19 vaccines, and incite anti-Semitism on 
17
a number of occasions. 
18
(2) The Foreign Minister of Iran, Javad Zarif, 
19
a senior official of a State Sponsor of Terrorism, has 
20
a number of social media accounts on Twitter, 
21
Instagram, and other platforms. On January 2,

(3) The President of the Syria, Bashar al- 
1
Assad, responsible for the brutal killing of half a 
2
million of his own people, and the President of a 
3
State Sponsor of Terrorism, has multiple social 
4
media accounts on Twitter and Instagram. He has 
5
used his accounts on social media to whitewash and 
6
promote his regime, and promote hatred against the 
7
United States and Israel. 
8
(4) The President of Cuba, Miguel Diaz-Canel, 
9
who heads a regime responsible for multiple gross 
10
violations of human rights, and which is a State 
11
Sponsor of Terrorism, has an account on Twitter 
12
representing the official Cuban Presidency. He has 
13
used his account on social media to promote global 
14
communism, anti-Americanism, and whitewash the 
15
Cuban regime’s human rights abuses. 
16
(5) Terrorist organizations and entities sanc-
17
tioned for terrorism under Executive Order 13224, 
18
including the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard 
19
Corps 
(IRGC), 
Hezbollah, 
Kata’ib 
Hezbollah, 
20
Hamas, and Asa’ib ahl al-Haq, have a number of so-
21
cial 
media 
accounts 
on 
Twitter, 
Facebook, 
22
Instagram, and YouTube. 
23
(6) Social media platforms make a profit on ac-
24
counts provided and maintained to individuals and 
25

•HR 1543 IH
entities sanctioned for terrorism through the sale of 
1
advertisements which are viewed by such sanctioned 
2
individuals through their accounts. 
3
(7) Economic sanctions prohibiting the provi-
4
sion of services to individuals and entities sanctioned 
5
for terrorism should apply to social media platforms, 
6
while still supporting the free flow of information 
7
and maintaining the important principle that infor-
8
mation should remain free of sanctions.
