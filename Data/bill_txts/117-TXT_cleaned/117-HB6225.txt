A BILL 
To modernize the business of selling firearms. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Federal Firearm Li-
4
censee Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
The Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) A growing body of evidence demonstrates 
8
that gun dealers’ sales practices affect the prob-
9
ability of guns getting to criminals and that policies

•HR 6225 IH
designed to hold gun sellers accountable can curtail 
1
the diversion of guns to criminals. 
2
(2) Federal laws governing firearm dealers have 
3
not been updated in over 30 years, contain safe-
4
guards that protect dealers who engage in illegal 
5
practices from adverse enforcement action, frustrate 
6
law enforcement efforts to curb gun trafficking and 
7
violence and are, thus, inadequate to meet the reali-
8
ties of the twenty-first century. 
9
(3) The Tiahrt Amendments, for one, severely 
10
limit the authority of the Bureau of Alcohol, To-
11
bacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) to disclose 
12
crime gun trace data to the public, prevent the col-
13
lection of valuable information, and the establish-
14
ment of effective policies to prevent illegal guns from 
15
being used in crimes and impede enforcement of the 
16
gun laws by requiring most background check 
17
records to be destroyed within 24 hours, and by bar-
18
ring the Government from requiring annual inven-
19
tory audits by owners of gun shops. Repealing the 
20
Tiahrt Amendments would support law enforcement 
21
efforts and give the public vital information needed 
22
to craft the most effective policies against illegal 
23
guns.

•HR 6225 IH
(4) Additionally, Federal law imposes no re-
1
quirements that dealers physically secure their high-
2
ly valuable and lethal inventory. The number of gun 
3
thefts from licensed gun dealers has increased more 
4
than the number from any other source. Between 
5
2013 and 2017, the number of firearms stolen in 
6
gun-dealer burglaries more than doubled and the 
7
number of firearms stolen in gun-dealer robberies 
8
tripled.
