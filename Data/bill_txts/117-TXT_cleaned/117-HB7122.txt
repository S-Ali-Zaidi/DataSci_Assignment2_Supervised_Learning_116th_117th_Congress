A BILL 
To direct the Secretary of Education to award grants to 
eligible entities to carry out teacher leadership programs, 
and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Teachers Leading,

Educating, Advancing, and Designing Act of 2022’’ or the 
5
‘‘Teachers LEAD Act of 2022’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
7
Congress finds the following: 
8
(1) Decades of research have shown that teach-
9
ers are the single most important school-based factor 
10

•HR 7122 IH
in student achievement, and an analysis by the 
1
Brookings Institution indicates that a high level of 
2
teacher turnover is negatively associated with stu-
3
dent achievement, and is higher in urban schools 
4
and schools with more economically disadvantaged 
5
students. 
6
(2) A report by the National Commission on 
7
Teaching and America’s Future estimated that dis-
8
tricts spend between $10,000 and $17,000 for each 
9
teacher who leaves the district, making teacher turn-
10
over and attrition a costly issue for school systems. 
11
(3) The United States education system is ex-
12
periencing an ongoing teacher recruitment, reten-
13
tion, and shortage crisis. According to a National 
14
Education Association survey in January of 2022, 
15
55 percent of all teachers, 62 percent of Black 
16
teachers, and 59 percent of Hispanic or Latino edu-
17
cators said they were more likely to retire early or 
18
leave the profession. 
19
(4) In the same survey, 74 percent of teachers 
20
report having to fill in for colleagues or take on 
21
other duties due to staff shortages, while 90 percent 
22
of respondents pointed out that teacher burnout is 
23
becoming a very serious issue. As a Nation, we face 
24
17:09 Mar 23, 2022
H7122

•HR 7122 IH
the possibilities of vacancies and educator burnout 
1
being exacerbated by educator shortages. 
2
(5) An analysis by the Economic Policy Insti-
3
tute of teacher turnover data suggests that low sala-
4
ries, lack of professional development opportunities, 
5
and a difficult school climate, including lack of 
6
teacher input into school policy, are common factors 
7
behind teachers leaving the workforce. 
8
(6) According to a report by Teach Plus and 
9
the Education Trust, teachers of color, who, on aver-
10
age experience higher turnover rates, report that 
11
they have considered leaving the profession because 
12
they lack agency, autonomy in decision making, and 
13
opportunities for leadership. 
14
(7) Studies show that all students benefit from 
15
having racially diverse teachers. These benefits are 
16
magnified for students of color, who experience im-
17
proved academic performance, higher graduation 
18
rates, and increased interest in pursuing higher edu-
19
cation. 
20
(8) Teachers of color are underrepresented in 
21
schools, with only 20 percent of the teacher work-
22
force identifying as people of color versus over 50 
23
percent of public school students. Teachers of color 
24
are also more likely to teach in schools that serve a 
25
17:09 Mar 23, 2022
H7122
4 
•HR 7122 IH
high proportion of students of color, in schools that 
1
are underresourced, and in schools that have higher 
2
overall teacher turnover rates. 
3
(9) Studies show that there is a positive link 
4
between professional leadership opportunities, job 
5
satisfaction, and retention of classroom teachers, 
6
and that compensation for teachers’ added leader-
7
ship responsibilities increases teacher retention. 
8
(10) In a Gates Foundation Survey, only 12 
9
percent of all teachers surveyed reported receiving 
10
consistent job-embedded mentorship and professional 
11
development from veteran teachers, despite multiple 
12
studies showing that consistent mentorship improves 
13
student learning. 
14
(11) The New Teacher Project found that only 
15
26 percent of high-performing teachers agreed that 
16
their school leadership identified opportunities or 
17
clear paths for teacher leadership roles. 
18
(12) According to a report by Teach Plus and 
19
the Education Trust, teachers’ investment in their 
20
schools and their likelihood of retention is greater 
21
where opportunities exist to innovate and advocate 
22
on behalf of students, especially when a teacher acts 
23
in partnership with school and district administra-
24
tion to address student and teacher needs. 
25

•HR 7122 IH
(13) Structured leadership programs are an ef-
1
fective way to help combat the nationwide teacher 
2
shortage and improve teacher retention by empow-
3
ering 
teachers 
and 
establishing 
formal 
peer 
4
mentorships between effective and experienced teach-
5
ers and those just entering the profession, which 
6
also leads to academic and socio-emotional benefits 
7
for students. 
8
(14) Federal policies are needed to encourage 
9
and fund the establishment of structured leadership 
10
programs at public schools, especially in high-need 
11
schools and school districts.
