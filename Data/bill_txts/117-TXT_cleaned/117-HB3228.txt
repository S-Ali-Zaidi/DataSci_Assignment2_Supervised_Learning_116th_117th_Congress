Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration, to improve science, data, and services 
that enable sound decision making in response to coastal 
flood risk, including impacts of sea level rise, storm 
events, changing Great Lakes water levels, and land sub-

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘National Coastal Resil-
2

3
SEC. 2. DECLARATION OF POLICY. 
4
It is the policy of the United States to bolster adapta-
5
tion and increase resilience by preparing for and pro-
6
tecting against the social, economic, and environmental 
7
impacts of coastal flood risk, including impacts of sea level 
8
rise, storm events, changing Great Lakes water levels, and 
9
land subsidence, in all coastal and Great Lakes States and 
10
territories by supporting actions that— 
11
(1) improve, create, and make investments in 
12
authoritative forecasts, predictions, projections, and 
13
services, including sustaining and enhancing under-
14
lying observing and spatial reference systems, map-
15
ping and geospatial services, modeling, product de-
16
velopment and delivery, including probabilistic as-
17
sessment of risks, and providing engagement and 
18
technical assistance to all levels of government, trib-
19
al governments, and to vulnerable and historically 
20
marginalized and overburdened communities; 
21
(2) convene and engage users and providers of 
22
relevant data and services, including Federal agen-
23
cies, State, local, tribal, and territorial governments, 
24
academia, the commercial sector, nonprofit and phil-
25
anthropic organizations, environmental justice orga-

nizations, and international partners to work to-
1
gether to identify needs and potential solutions, fill 
2
gaps in services, and provide technical assistance to 
3
inform decision making; and 
4
(3) promote a coordinated, whole of government 
5
approach to ensuring that our citizens have the 
6
coastal data and services needed to increase our na-
7
tional resilience.

SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
9
Congress finds the following: 
10
(1) Coastal flood risk, including the impacts of 
11
sea level rise, dramatic shifts in Great Lakes water 
12
levels, land subsidence, and damage from high tide 
13
flooding and storm events are severely impacting 
14
coastal States, territories, communities, economies, 
15
and ecosystems. 
16
(2) Millions of people and billions of dollars in 
17
critical infrastructure are at risk due to the threat 
18
of coastal floods, the impacts of which are predicted 
19
to be more frequent and severe in the future and 
20
present a crisis on the coast that threatens national 
21
and economic security. 
22
(3) According to the National Oceanic and At-
23
mospheric Administration— 
24
04:17 Jun 26, 2021
H3228
4 
•HR 3228 IH
(A) the 2020 United States Atlantic hurri-
1
cane season was the most active on record with 
2
30 named storms, 7 of which were billion-dollar 
3
disasters exceeding $40 billion in total dam-
4
ages; and 
5
(B) the United States annual high tide 
6
flooding frequency is accelerating and has more 
7
than doubled since 2000 due to rising relative 
8
sea levels, with United States coastal commu-
9
nities today experiencing an average of 2 to 6 
10
high tide flooding days each year and expected 
11
to experience an increase to between 7 and 15 
12
days each year by 2030 and between 25 and 75 
13
days each year by 2050. 
14
(4) Our societal response to these threats re-
15
quires sound decision making within many sectors of 
16
our society, including those concerned with human 
17
health, social equity, insurance, finance, infrastruc-
18
ture investments, building codes, engineering design, 
19
zoning, urban planning, transportation, marine com-
20
merce, emergency preparedness, disaster response 
21
and recovery, ecosystem restoration, marine resource 
22
management, marine conservation, and more. 
23
(5) Each of these endeavors requires accurate 
24
and authoritative data, observations, modeling, map-
25
04:17 Jun 26, 2021
H3228
5 
•HR 3228 IH
ping, and services that quantify and clearly commu-
1
nicate the drivers of coastal flood risk, including sea 
2
level rise, to improve understanding of present day 
3
and future flood risk at the coast and enable sound 
4
public policy and risk-informed decision making. 
5
(6) A whole of government approach is required 
6
to understand and combat the crisis on the coast. As 
7
is the case with the delivery of data and services to 
8
support decision making with respect to severe 
9
weather, hurricanes, inland flooding, and space 
10
weather, many Federal agencies have key contribu-
11
tions to make. The leadership role of the National 
12
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (in this 
13
Act referred to as the ‘‘NOAA’’) is critical given the 
14
agency’s mission and extensive expertise. 
15
(7) In addition to State, local, tribal, and terri-
16
torial governments, the private sector, and other 
17
constituencies, many Federal agencies rely on the 
18
data and services of the NOAA to inform their mis-
19
sions and investments. 
20
(8) In addition to being users of NOAA data 
21
and services, other Federal agencies conduct or sup-
22
port observations, modeling, research, and other ac-
23
tivities that contribute to and inform the coastal 
24
forecasts, data, and services provided by the NOAA.

(9) Strengthening and sustaining the programs, 
1
networks, observations, and modeling of the NOAA 
2
to support improved coastal flood risk products and 
3
services is an urgent national priority. Doing so will 
4
materially benefit the myriad economic and resource 
5
management sectors that are being impacted by 
6
coastal flooding, sea level rise, changing Great Lakes 
7
water levels, and land subsidence. 
8
(10) There is an urgent need for the NOAA, in 
9
partnership with other Federal agencies, to expand 
10
and enhance observations, mapping, modeling, and 
11
services that inform the public and decision makers 
12
about risk from coastal flooding, sea level rise, 
13
changing Great Lakes water levels, and land subsid-
14
ence by— 
15
(A) identifying and leveraging existing ca-
16
pacities and capabilities to assess and predict 
17
coastal flood risk and its impacts; and 
18
(B) convening a national effort to deliver 
19
enhanced authoritative and science-based prod-
20
ucts, services, and technical assistance.
