•HR 9274 IH
(1) In 1942, the Federal Government ordered 
1
that a Maryland National Guard Training Ground 
2
be turned into a War Department Military Intel-
3
ligence Training Center, which was named Camp 
4
Ritchie after the late Governor, Albert C. Ritchie. 
5
(2) Starting in 1942, more than 19,000 men 
6
trained at Camp Ritchie in Maryland and became 
7
known as the Ritchie Boys. 
8
(3) While the approximately 2,800 refugees who 
9
had fled Nazi persecution in Germany and Austria 
10
and had come to the United States as ‘‘enemy 
11
aliens’’ prior to the entry of the United States into 
12
World War II only constituted approximately 14 
13
percent of the total number of Ritchie Boys, they 
14
had the strongest motivation to return to Europe 
15
and fight for their newly adopted country. 
16
(4) The Ritchie Boys included— 
17
(A) soldiers of many faiths (including 
18
Protestant, Jewish, and Catholic soldiers); 
19
(B) both soldiers born in the United States 
20
and foreign-born soldiers from more than 70 
21
countries; 
22
(C) 
soldiers 
with 
German, 
Japanese 
23
(Nisei), and other language skills; and

(D) more importantly, soldiers with gen-
1
eral intelligence skills suitable for being trained 
2
as order-of-battle specialists, counterintelligence 
3
operatives, photo interpreters, psychological 
4
warfare experts, and other specialists. 
5
(5) During World War II, Ritchie Boys were 
6
assigned to every unit of the Army and the Marines 
7
as well as to the Office of Strategic Services and the 
8
Counter Intelligence Corps. 
9
(6) Starting in 1942, the Ritchie Boys were 
10
sent as individual specialists to the Supreme Head-
11
quarters Allied Expeditionary Force (‘‘SHAEF’’) in 
12
small elite teams to join combat units in the North 
13
African, Mediterranean, European, and Pacific thea-
14
ters and to military camps, prisoner-of-war camps, 
15
and interrogation centers (such as Fort Hunt, Vir-
16
ginia) in the United States. 
17
(7) The Ritchie Boys accompanied the Army on 
18
D-Day in Europe as foot soldiers with all Army divi-
19
sions and as paratroopers with all airborne divisions 
20
and were often selected to be the second soldier to 
21
land after the commander in order to provide needed 
22
immediate interpretation in languages such as 
23
French, German, and Italian.

(8) The Ritchie Boys served as personal inter-
1
preters for General George Patton and other mili-
2
tary leaders. 
3
(9) The Ritchie Boys served honorably in the 
4
Pacific in the assaults on Guadalcanal, Okinawa, 
5
Iwo Jima, and the Philippines, including 2 Marine 
6
Corps Ritchie Boys who died in the initial landing 
7
on Iwo Jima and a Ritchie Boy who was awarded 
8
the Medal of Honor posthumously for bravery. 
9
(10) Approximately 140 Ritchie Boys lost their 
10
lives during World War II. 
11
(11) The Ritchie Boys garnered more than 65 
12
Silver Star Medals and numerous Bronze Star Med-
13
als as well as at least 5 Legion of Honor and many 
14
Croix de Guerre Medals. 
15
(12) Among the 150-man Second Mobile Radio 
16
Broadcast Company of the Ritchie Boys, 6 members 
17
received the Croix de Guerre Medal and at least 15 
18
received Bronze Star Medals for service and bravery. 
19
(13) The Ritchie Boys made significant con-
20
tributions to the success of the Allied Forces on the 
21
Western Front through their knowledge and their 
22
skills, as demonstrated by a classified postwar report 
23
by the Army finding that the Ritchie Boys were the 
24

•HR 9274 IH
source of nearly 60 percent of the credible intel-
1
ligence gathered in Europe during World War II. 
2
(14) Many of the Ritchie Boys continued to 
3
serve their country following the conclusion of World 
4
War II, including through service as translators or 
5
interrogators prosecuting war criminals with the 
6
Judge Advocate General’s Office during trials at Da-
7
chau and Nuremberg. 
8
(15) The Ritchie Boys include such notable fig-
9
ures as David Rockefeller, Archibald Roosevelt Jr., 
10
William Sloane Coffin, Philip Johnson, J.D. Sal-
11
inger, and William Warfield, as well as Senators 
12
John Chafee of Rhode Island and Frank Church of 
13
Idaho, and the father of the current senior Senator 
14
from Oregon, Ron Wyden. 
15
(16) The Ritchie Boys also contributed outside 
16
of the military through careers as writers, artists, 
17
architects, academics, diplomats, economists, fin-
18
anciers, philanthropists, and psychologists. 
19
(17) Because the roles of the Ritchie Boys re-
20
mained classified for decades, the public generally 
21
lacks awareness of their contributions. 
22
(18) Camp Ritchie closed in 1998, and a mu-
23
seum and educational center is now being planned 
24
for the location.
