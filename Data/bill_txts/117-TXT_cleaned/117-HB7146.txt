DISTRIBUTION.—For purposes of 
2
this subparagraph, the term ‘emergency

4
distribution from an applicable eligible re-
5

6
(H)(vi)(I)) to an individual for purposes of 
7
meeting unforeseeable or immediate finan-
8
cial needs relating to necessary personal or 
9
family emergency expenses. The adminis-
10
trator of an applicable eligible retirement 
11
plan may rely on an employee’s certifi-
12
cation that the employee satisfies the con-
13
ditions of the preceding sentence in deter-
14
mining whether any distribution is an 
15
emergency personal expense distribution.

‘‘(v) TREATMENT OF PLAN DISTRIBU-
17
TIONS.—If a distribution to an individual 
18
would (without regard to clause (iii)) be an 
19
emergency personal expense distribution, a 
20
plan shall not be treated as failing to meet 
21
any requirement of this title merely be-
22
cause the plan treats the distribution as an 
23
emergency personal expense distribution, 
24
unless the aggregate amount of such dis-

aggregate amount not to exceed the
