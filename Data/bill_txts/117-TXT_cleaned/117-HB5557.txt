SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
3
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
4
(1) The Cuban Communist takeover of 1959 es-
5
tablished in Cuba a one-party authoritarian state of 
6
the Cuban Communist Party. 
7
(2) Cuba is a totalitarian state, in which the 
8
Cuban Communist Party has brutally oppressed the 
9
people of Cuba for more than 60 years. 
10
(3) Cuban democracy activists, including Las 
11
Damas de Blanco (also known as ‘‘Ladies in 
12
White’’), a group composed of wives and relatives of 
13
political prisoners, prisoners of conscience, and 
14
peaceful activists in Cuba, are routinely repressed, 
15
censured, beaten, and unjustly imprisoned by the 
16
Cuban Communist Party. 
17
(4) On July 11, 2021, protesters marched in 
18
the streets throughout Cuba voicing their opposition 
19
against the communist regime of Cuba. 
20
(5) During those protests, Cubans in more than 
21
40 cities throughout the entire island held dem-
22
onstrations 
chanting 
‘‘Libertad!’’, 
‘‘Abajo 
la 
23
Dictadura de Cuba’’ (‘‘Down with the Dictator-
24
04:32 Oct 14, 2021
H5557
3 
•HR 5557 IH
ship’’), and ‘‘Patria y Vida!’’ (‘‘Homeland and 
1
Life’’). 
2
(6) Through those protests, the people of Cuba 
3
demanded the end to communism in Cuba and ac-
4
cess to food, medicine, water, and electricity, basic 
5
needs that the communist system in Cuba cannot 
6
provide. 
7
(7) Cubans gathered outside of the head-
8
quarters of the Cuban Communist Party chanting, 
9
‘‘Cuba isn’t yours!’’. In a clear message, Cubans ex-
10
ercised their fundamental God-given rights to peace-
11
ably assemble, express their political opinions, and 
12
live free of censorship and oppression and demanded 
13
the ruling elites, especially the Cuban Communist 
14
Party, give the power back to the people. 
15
(8) During the July 11, 2021, protests, the 
16
Cuban Communist Party deployed a wave of terror 
17
throughout Cuba by— 
18
(A) unleashing its secret police and some 
19
military forces on peaceful protesters and un-
20
lawfully detained them, including by— 
21
(i) harassing and threatening people 
22
in their homes; 
23
04:32 Oct 14, 2021
H5557
4 
•HR 5557 IH
(ii) abducting and torturing civil soci-
1
ety leaders and other Cubans peacefully 
2
exercising their fundamental rights; and 
3
(iii) detaining more than 800 Cubans 
4
for peacefully protesting, who have gone 
5
missing since the protests and demonstra-
6
tions began, including leaders from Cuban 
7
civil society groups such as UNPACU, the 
8
San Isidro Movement, the Ladies in White, 
9
and religious leaders; and 
10
(B) in a crude and savage effort to silence 
11
the Cuban people, cutting internet connectivity 
12
and mobile services throughout Cuba, which 
13
prevented the Cuban people from organizing 
14
and hid from the outside world images and vid-
15
eos of the oppressive and brutal crackdown. 
16
(9) In response to these demonstrations and 
17
protests, the regime blocked access to social media, 
18
messaging platforms and cellular services, and ar-
19
rested and detained hundreds of protesters, activists, 
20
and journalists, according to Cuban human rights 
21
groups. 
22
(10) The Human Rights Report on Cuba for 
23
2020 set forth by the Department of State found 
24
that Cuba is an authoritarian state.

•HR 5557 IH
(11) A new constitution ratified in February 
1
2019 codified that Cuba remains a one-party system 
2
in which the Cuban Communist Party is the only 
3
legal political party. Elections in Cuba were neither 
4
free, fair, nor competitive. 
5
(12) The Ministry of Interior of Cuba 
6
(MININT) controls police, internal security forces, 
7
and the prison system. The National Revolutionary 
8
Police are the primary law enforcement organization 
9
of the Ministry. Specialized units of the state secu-
10
rity branch of the Ministry are responsible for moni-
11
toring, infiltrating, and suppressing independent po-
12
litical activity. The national leadership of Cuba, in-
13
cluding members of the military, maintain effective 
14
control over the security forces. Members of the se-
15
curity forces have committed numerous abuses. 
16
(13) Significant human rights issues in Cuba 
17
perpetrated by the Communist Party include the fol-
18
lowing: 
19
(A) Unlawful or arbitrary killings, includ-
20
ing extrajudicial killings. 
21
(B) Forced disappearances. 
22
(C) Torture and cruel, inhuman, and de-
23
grading treatment of political dissidents, detain-
24
ees, and prisoners by security forces.

(D) Harsh and life-threatening prison con-
1
ditions. 
2
(E) Arbitrary arrests and detentions. 
3
(F) The detaining of political prisoners. 
4
(G) Significant problems with the inde-
5
pendence of the judiciary. 
6
(H) Arbitrary or unlawful interference 
7
with privacy. 
8
(I) Functional lack of freedom of the 
9
press, as criminal libel laws are used against 
10
persons who criticize the ruling Communist 
11
Party of Cuba and that it has engaged in cen-
12
sorship and internet site blocking. 
13
(J) Severe limitations on academic and 
14
cultural freedom. 
15
(K) Severe restrictions on the right of 
16
peaceful assembly and denial of freedom of as-
17
sociation, including refusal to recognize inde-
18
pendent associations. 
19
(L) Severe restrictions on religious free-
20
dom. 
21
(M) Restrictions on internal and external 
22
freedom of movement. 
23
(N) Inability of citizens to change their 
24
government through free and fair elections.

(O) Restrictions on political participation

to members of the ruling party.

(P) Corruption within the ruling party, the

Communist Party of Cuba. 
4
(Q) Trafficking in persons, including com-
5
pulsory labor. 
6
(R) 
Outlawing 
of 
independent 
trade 
7
unions. 
8
(14) Many within the high level operatives of 
9
the Communist Party of Cuba, at the direction of 
10
their superiors, have committed most human rights 
11
abuses. As a matter of policy, superiors failed to in-
12
vestigate or prosecute the individuals who committed 
13
those abuses. Impunity for the perpetrators has re-
14
mained widespread. 
15
(15) The United States Commission on Inter-
16
national 
Religious 
Freedom 
(USCIRF) 
rec-
17
ommended in its 2021 Annual Report that the 
18
United States Government again placed Cuba on the 
19
special watch list under section 402(b)(1)(A)(iii) of 
20
the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 
21
(22 U.S.C. 6442(b)(1)(A)(iii)) and recommended im-
22
posing sanctions on the Office of Religious Affairs of 
23
Cuba.

•HR 5557 IH
(16) In the report specified in paragraph (15), 
1
the United States Commission on International Reli-
2
gious Freedom (USCIRF) raised concerns regarding 
3
the denial in Cuba of religious freedom for human 
4
rights activists, independent journalists, and pro-
5
testers, particularly in the wake of demonstrations 
6
that started on November 13, 2020, calling for 
7
greater freedom of expression in Cuba. 
8
(17) Cuba is ground zero for a series of inter-
9
national and yet unexplained attacks that com-
10
menced in 2016 on members of the United States 
11
and Canadian diplomatic community. 
12
(18) Cuba continues to provide safe harbor for 
13
adversaries of the United States, including multiple 
14
fugitives from justice in the United States, including 
15
William Morales, Charles Hill, Victor Manuel 
16
Gerena, and Joanne Chesimard, who executed New 
17
Jersey State Trooper Werner Foerster during a rou-
18
tine traffic stop in May 1973. 
19
(19) The Trade Sanctions Reform and Export 
20
Enhancement Act (TSRA) of 2000 (22 U.S.C. 7201 
21
et seq.) prohibits the President from imposing uni-
22
lateral agricultural or medical sanctions against 
23
Cuba.

(20) The defense, security, and intelligence sec-
1
tors of Cuba are the primary perpetrators of beat-
2
ings, 
arrests, 
detainments, 
and 
unjust 
3
imprisonments of the Cuban people. 
4
(21) The Cuban Communist Party has a long 
5
history of racism. 
6
(22) Many Cubans who suffered the worst 
7
treatment at the hands of the security forces of the 
8
Cuban Communist Party are Afro-Cuban, such as 
9
Dr. O´scar Elı´as Biscet, Jorge Luis Garcı´a Pe´rez, 
10
Berta Soler, Guillermo Farin˜as, Orlando Zapata 
11
Tamayo, Luis Manuel Otero Alca´ntara, and Ivan 
12
Hernandez Carrillo. 
13
(23) On January 12, 2021, the Department of 
14
State determined that Cuba has repeatedly provided 
15
support for acts of international terrorism and was 
16
designated a state sponsor of terrorism. 
17
(24) On May 14, 2021, Secretary of State 
18
Antony Blinken determined and certified to Con-
19
gress that Cuba is not cooperating fully with United 
20
States antiterrorism efforts. 
21
(25) The Cuban Communist Party continues to 
22
support international terrorist groups such as the 
23
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) 
24
and the National Liberation Army (ELN).

(26) Commercial engagement with the defense, 
1
security, and intelligence sectors of Cuba empowers 
2
the human rights abuses, racism against Afro-Cu-
3
bans, and support for international terrorism by the 
4
Cuban Communist Party.

(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
6
gress that Congress— 
7
(1) reaffirms subsection (a) of section 1704 of 
8
the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 (CDA) (22 
9
U.S.C. 6003), which states that the President 
10
should encourage foreign countries to restrict trade 
11
and credit relations with Cuba in a manner con-
12
sistent with the purposes of that Act; and 
13
(2) urges the President to take immediate steps 
14
