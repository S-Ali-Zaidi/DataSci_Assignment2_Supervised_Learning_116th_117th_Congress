(3) 4.6-percent increase in the number of violent 
crimes per capita; 
Whereas, in the United States, about 12 people are killed 
with guns for every 100,000 United States residents;

Whereas 1 in 4 women and 1 in 7 men have experienced se-
vere physical violence at the hands of an intimate partner

Whereas intimate partner violence has become the pandemic

ported experiencing intimate partner violence in the last 
year;

more likely to be victims of violent crime than the general 
population; 
Whereas exposure to violence can cause significant psycho-
logical trauma for individuals and communities; 
Whereas a large majority of adults in the United States expe-
rience stress associated with mass shootings, and a third

for individuals, including higher rates of mental health 
conditions and substance use;

•HRES 820 IH 
Whereas corporal punishment in schools is ineffective, inter-
feres with learning, and causes injury and trauma; 
Whereas cognitive behavioral therapy, especially when focused 
on trauma specifically, has shown promising results help-
ing individuals heal from exposure to violence; 
Whereas communities require the resources necessary to 
properly heal and recover from the trauma caused by vio-
lence; 
Whereas unchecked rises in violence create a vicious cycle 
that entrenches the conditions that cause violence; 
Whereas nonviolent, evidence-based, community-based solu-
tions to violence prevention and intervention can effec-
tively promote public safety, with methods including but 
not limited to— 
(1) violence intervention and prevention programs 
that help deescalate violent situations and work to pre-
vent situations from becoming violent in the first place; 
(2) hospital-based violence prevention programs that 
provide wraparound services to victims to help mitigate 
the risk of reinjury or retaliatory violence; 
(3) group violence intervention that uses partner-
ships between community leaders, social service providers, 
and law enforcement to identify high-risk individuals and 
work with them to avoid violent outcomes; 
(4) trauma-informed cognitive behavioral therapy; 
and 
(5) replacing exclusionary, punitive discipline prac-
tices in schools, which perpetuate the school-to-prison 
pipeline, with positive, restorative, nonadversarial alter-
natives;

•HRES 820 IH 
Whereas a spike in gun violence has widespread negative eco-
nomic implications for a community, including declining 
business formation, fewer available jobs, plummeting 
property values, lower home ownership rates, and declin-
ing average credit scores; 
Whereas the rise in violence represents a preventable public 
health crisis that can be combated by sending resources 
to local communities to address the underlying causes of 
violence, including but not limited to poverty, housing in-
security, food insecurity, education, and limited access to 
mental health care; and 
Whereas the aftermath of gun violence costs communities 
$280,000,000,000 annually, which could otherwise be 
used to provide resources and services that address the 
root causes of violence: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
