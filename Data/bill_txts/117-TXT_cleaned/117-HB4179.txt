SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The United States has a long history of wel-
3
coming individuals of diverse national backgrounds 
4
who legally travel to the United States seeking op-
5
portunity and prosperity. 
6
(2) Immigrants and refugees in the United 
7
States bring a diverse range of professional back-
8
grounds that strengthens the workforce of the 
9
United States and benefits American businesses. 
10
(3) The underutilization of the skills and expe-
11
rience of immigrants and refugees, often referred to 
12
as brain waste, comes at a significant cost to the 
13
economy of the United States and to immigrant 
14
families. 
15
(4) In 2016, researchers at the Migration Pol-
16
icy Institute found that nearly 2 million immigrants 
17
and refugees with college degrees in the United 
18
States were relegated to low-skilled jobs or were un-
19
able to find work. 
20
(5) On an annual basis, this underutilization is 
21
estimated to result in more than $10 billion in unre-
22
alized tax receipts from Federal, State, and local 
23
governments, and over $39 billion in unrealized 
24
wages for college-educated immigrants and refugees.

(6) Many factors contribute to brain waste, in-
1
cluding language barriers, limits on the recognition 
2
of international degrees and credentials, the accessi-
3
bility of relicensing processes, and the availability of 
4
professional networks and assistance in finding suit-
5
able employment. 
6
(7) In the interest of strengthening the econ-
7
omy of the United States and ensuring consistent 
8
opportunities for the realization of the full potential 
9
of immigrant and refugee families, substantive ef-
10
forts must be made to analyze and address the scope 
11
of brain waste in the United States.
