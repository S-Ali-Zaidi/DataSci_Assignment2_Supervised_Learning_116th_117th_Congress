SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
The Congress finds as follows: 
2
(1) The allocation of Special Drawing Rights 
3
(SDRs) through the International Monetary Fund 
4
(IMF) creates unconditional liquidity for IMF mem-
5
ber countries. 
6
(2) According to Article XVIII of the Articles 
7
of Agreement of the IMF, allocations of SDRs ‘‘shall 
8
seek to meet the long-term global need’’ in reserve 
9
assets. 
10
(3) SDRs are allocated in proportion to the 
11
quotas of IMF members, such that the G20 alone is 
12
entitled to approximately two-thirds of a general al-
13
location. At the same time, the Board of Governors 
14
of the Federal Reserve System has swap line ar-
15
rangements with the central banks of eight G20 
16
members, including the European Central Bank, the 
17
Bank of Japan, and the Bank of England, for the 
18
purpose of providing sufficient liquidity. 
19
(4) The size of SDR allocations has expanded 
20
dramatically, rising from 9,300,000,000 SDRs in 
21
1970–1972, to 12,100,000,000 SDRs in 1979–1981, 
22
to 204,000,000,000 SDRs in 2009, with proposals 
23
for a new, unilateral allocation that bypasses con-
24
gressional authorization in an amount of approxi-
25
mately 450,000,000,000 SDRs.

•HR 1568 IH
(5) Under current law, the Secretary of the 
1
Treasury is able to bypass Congress and approve an 
2
allocation of SDRs in a manner that provides uncon-
3
ditional liquidity in the following approximate 
4
amounts: $41,700,000,000 to the People’s Republic 
5
of China; $17,600,000,000 to the Russian Federa-
6
tion; $4,900,000,000 to the Islamic Republic of 
7
Iran, and $5,000,000,000 to Venezuela. In addition, 
8
current law permits allocations in these amounts to 
9
be made in successive years that span two basic pe-
10
riods. 
11
(6) In the 98th Congress, the House of Rep-
12
resentatives passed the bipartisan International Re-
13
covery and Financial Stability Act, which would have 
14
prohibited new allocations of SDRs without congres-
15
sional authorization.
