SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) In enacting title IX of the Education 
3
Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.), after 
4
careful deliberation and debate and more than 250 
5
educational proposals leading up to the introduction 
6
and enactment of title IX, Congress explicitly envi-
7
sioned a prohibition against ‘‘discrimination on the 
8
basis of sex,’’ to mean any discrimination based on 
9
biological distinctions between male and female. This 
10
is supported by the plain and ordinary meaning of 
11
the statutory text, by the Congressional Record, and 
12
by title IX’s enacting regulations. 
13
(2) Executive branch administrative or regu-
14
latory actions, policies, or guidances, from the U.S. 
15
Department of Education, the U.S. Department of 
16
Agriculture, or other agencies or entities, that seek 
17
to rewrite or reinterpret the plain and unambiguous 
18
language of title IX as having meaning beyond 
19
‘‘sex’’ as the biological distinctions between male and 
20
female—including such constructs as ‘‘sexual ori-
21
entation and gender identity’’—not only inappropri-
22
ately misconstrue title IX’s plain and clear statutory 
23
language, but they also contravene congressional in-
24
tent behind its enactment, and misapply Supreme 
25
Court precedent on sex discrimination. Additionally

and importantly, any such administrative actions by 
1
fiat usurp and circumvent legislative powers that are 
2
the sole province of Congress under article I, section 
3
1 of the Constitution. 
4
(3) In its 2020 decision Bostock v. Clayton 
5
County, 140 S. Ct. (2020), the U.S. Supreme Court 
6
expressly limited its decision to and narrowly ad-
7
dressed employment issues, did not construe title IX, 
8
and expressly disclaimed application to ‘‘other fed-
9
eral or state laws that prohibit sex discrimination’’. 
10
Thus, it is altogether and entirely improper, inap-
11
propriate, and misguided to construe Bostock as ap-
12
plying to title IX. 
13
SEC. 3. REPEAL OF EXECUTIVE ORDER 13988. 
14
(a) REPEAL.—Executive Order 13988, 86 Fed. Reg. 
15
7023 (January 25, 2021), is hereby repealed. 
16
(b) RELATED ACTION.—Any regulations, guidance, 
17
or other agency action related to such Executive order 
18
shall not have any force or effect and are hereby repealed 
19
or revoked, as applicable.
