A BILL 
To amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide 
information regarding vaccines for seniors as part of 
the Medicare & You handbook and to ensure that the 
treatment of cost sharing for vaccines under Medicare 
part D is consistent with the treatment of vaccines under 
Medicare part B, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Protecting Seniors 
2
Through Immunization Act of 2021’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress makes the following findings: 
5
(1) The immune system deteriorates with age, 
6
leaving older adults more susceptible to many vac-
7
cine-preventable diseases that could result in hos-
8
pitalizations and other costly medical interventions. 
9
(2) Vaccines play an essential role in preventing 
10
disease, thereby helping to keep older adults active 
11
and independent. 
12
(3) There are more than a dozen immunizations 
13
recommended for adult populations by the Advisory 
14
Committee on Immunization Practices of the Cen-
15
ters for Disease Control and Prevention, including— 
16
(A) influenza; 
17
(B) tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis (Tdap); 
18
(C) measles, mumps, rubella (MMR); 
19
(D) herpes zoster (shingles); 
20
(E) human papillomavirus (HPV); 
21
(F) pneumococcal; 
22
(G) hepatitis A; 
23
(H) hepatitis B; and 
24
(I) meningococcal.

•HR 1978 IH
(4) Through new research and technology, addi-
1
tional vaccines may be approved for older adults. 
2
(5) Although immunizations are lifesaving and 
3
cost-effective interventions, adult vaccination rates 
4
in the United States remain below Federal Healthy 
5
People benchmarks. 
6
(6) There are disparities in adult vaccination 
7
rates across different races and ethnicities with rates 
8
generally lower among Hispanics, African Ameri-
9
cans, and Asian Americans. 
10
(7) Important vaccines, including those for 
11
shingles and Tdap, are covered under the Medicare 
12
Prescription Drug Program under part D of title 
13
XVIII of the Social Security Act. Coverage under 
14
the Medicare part D has resulted in barriers to opti-
15
mal and consistent uptake, including lack of patient 
16
and provider awareness, beneficiary cost sharing, 
17
and low provider reimbursement, as well as geo-
18
graphic, cultural, and linguistic challenges. 
19
(8) The Advisory Committee on Immunization 
20
Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and 
21
Prevention recommends the Tdap vaccine should be 
22
administered every 10 years for all ages. According 
23
to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
24
Surveillance of Vaccination Coverage Among Adults

•HR 1978 IH
in the United States, National Health Interview Sur-
1
vey, 2016, vaccination rates remain low for tetanus 
2
and diphtheria (Td) and tetanus and diphtheria with 
3
acellular pertussis (Tdap) for adults age 65 and 
4
older, at 58 percent and 20 percent respectively. 
5
(9) Being up-to-date with Tdap is especially im-
6
portant for adults who are around babies, because 
7
they are not only protecting their own health but 
8
helping to form a ‘‘cocoon’’ of disease protection 
9
around the baby during the first few months of life. 
10
(10) The Advisory Committee on Immunization 
11
Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and 
12
Prevention recommends the shingles vaccine for indi-
13
viduals aged 50 and older. While vaccine coverage 
14
for shingles has increased each year since licensure, 
15
in 2016, only 33 percent of adults over 60 years re-
16
ported receiving the vaccine. 
17
(11) Almost 1 out of every 3 people in the 
18
United States will develop shingles in their lifetime. 
19
The risk increases with age, and older individuals 
20
are much more likely to experience postherpetic neu-
21
ralgia non-pain complications, hospitalizations, and 
22
interference with activities of daily living, such as 
23
eating, dressing, and bathing.

•HR 1978 IH
(12) A 2018 study of Tdap and shingles vaccine 
1
claims in Medicare part D demonstrated that higher 
2
out-of-pocket cost sharing was associated with high-
3
er rates of cancelled vaccination claims, suggesting 
4
vaccination was abandoned. In this study, cost shar-
5
ing of $51 or greater was associated with a 2 to 2.7- 
6
times greater rate of cancelled vaccination claims 
7
compared with $0 cost sharing. 
8
(13) There is an opportunity to improve edu-
9
cation around adult immunization, including the 
10
risks and consequences of vaccine-preventable dis-
11
ease, and which vaccines are recommended for older 
12
adults.
