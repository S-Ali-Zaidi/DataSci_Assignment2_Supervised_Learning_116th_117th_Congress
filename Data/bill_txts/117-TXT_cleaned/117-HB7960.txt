(1) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
1
(A) Photo voter identification programs es-
2
tablished by the States should be administered 
3
without unlawful discrimination and with an 
4
eye toward balancing appropriate access to the 
5
ballot box with election integrity and voter con-
6
fidence goals. 
7
(B) As confirmed by the bipartisan Com-
8
mission on Federal Election Reform (commonly 
9
known as the Carter-Baker Commission), 
10
‘‘[v]oters in nearly 100 democracies use a photo 
11
identification card without fear of infringement 
12
of their rights’’. 
13
(C) As confirmed by the Carter-Baker 
14
Commission, ‘‘[t]he right to vote is a vital com-
15
ponent of U.S. citizenship and all States should 
16
use their best efforts to obtain proof of citizen-
17
ship before registering voters.’’. 
18
(D) The Carter-Baker Commission was 
19
correct in its 2005 report when it recommended 
20
that the REAL ID Act be ‘‘modestly adapted 
21
for voting purposes to indicate on the front or 
22
back whether the individual is a U.S. citizen.’’. 
23
(E) Congress acknowledges the important 
24
work completed by the Carter-Baker Commis-

sion and, by amending the REAL ID Act, re-
1
solves the concerns in the Commission’s report 
2
that ‘‘[t]he REAL ID Act does not require that 
3
the card indicates citizenship, but that would 
4
need to be done if the card is to be used for 
5
voting purposes’’. 
6
(F) Photographic voter identification is im-
7
portant for ensuring voter confidence in election 
8
processes and outcomes. 
9
(G) Requiring photographic voter identi-
10
fication is well within States’ constitutional 
11
competence, including pursuant to the Quali-
12
fications Clause of the Constitution of the 
13
United States (article I, section 2, clause 2), 
14
the Presidential Electors Clause of the Con-
15
stitution (article II, section 1, clause 2), and 
16
the Seventeenth Amendment. 
17
(H) The Fifteenth Amendment, the Nine-
18
teenth Amendment, the Twenty-Fourth Amend-
19
ment, and the Twenty-Sixth Amendment, 
20
among other references, make clear that the 
21
Constitution prohibits voting by non-citizens in 
22
Federal elections. 
23
(I) Congress has the constitutional author-
24
ity, including under the aforementioned amend-
25

ments, to pass statutes preventing non-citizens 
1
from voting in Federal elections, and did so 
2
with the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immi-
3
grant Responsibility Act of 1996. 
4
(J) Congress may further exercise its con-
5
stitutional authority to ensure the Constitu-
6
tion’s prohibition on non-citizen voting in Fed-
7
eral elections is upheld. 
8
(2) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
9
Congress that the States should implement the sub-
10
stance of the recommendation of the Carter-Baker 
11
Commission that, ‘‘[t]o ensure that persons pre-
12
senting themselves at the polling place are the ones 
13
on the registration list, the Commission recommends 
14
that states [encourage] voters to use the REAL ID 
15
card, which was mandated in a law signed by the 
16
President in May 2005’’. 
17
(b) REAL ID ACT AMENDMENT.— 
18
(1) AMENDMENT.—Section 202(b) of the Real 
19
ID Act of 2005 (49 U.S.C. 30301 note) is amended 
20
by adding at the end the following new paragraph: 
21
‘‘(10) If the person is a citizen of the United 
22
States, an indication of that citizenship, except that 
23
no other information may be included with respect 
24
to the immigration status of the person.’’.

6
tion or in any amendment made by this section may be

identification card or to authorize any office of the execu-
9
tive branch to establish or mandate the use of a national

identification card.
