SECTION 1. APPROVAL OF REGULATIONS RELATING TO 
1
FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT. 
2
(a) IN GENERAL.—The regulations described in sub-
3
section (b) are hereby approved, insofar as such regula-
4
tions apply to covered employees of the House of Rep-
5
resentatives under the Congressional Accountability Act of

with the provisions of such Act.

(b) REGULATIONS APPROVED.—The regulations de-
9
scribed in this subsection are the regulations issued by the 
10
Office of Congressional Workplace Rights on December 7, 
11
2021, under section 202(e) of the Congressional Account-

ability Act of 1995 to implement section 202 of such Act 
13
(relating to the application of sections 101 through 105 
14
of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993), as pub-
15
lished in the Congressional Record on December 7, 2021 
16
(Volume 167, daily edition) on pages H7230 through 
17
H7258, and stated as follows:

‘‘§ 825.1 Purpose and scope 
19
‘‘(a) Section 202 of the Congressional Accountability 
20
Act (CAA) (2 U.S.C. 1312) applies the rights and protec-
21
tions of sections 101 through 105 of the Family and Med-
22
ical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) (29 U.S.C. 2611–2615) 
23
to covered employees. (The term ‘covered employee’ is de-
24
fined in section 101(3) of the CAA (2 U.S.C. 1301(3)). 
25
See 825.102 of these regulations for that definition.) The

•HRES 1516 IH 
purpose of this part is to set forth the regulations to carry 
1
out the provisions of section 202 of the CAA. 
2
‘‘(b) These regulations are issued by the Board of Di-
3
rectors (Board) of the Office of Congressional Workplace 
4
Rights, pursuant to sections 202(d) and 304 of the CAA, 
5
which direct the Board to promulgate regulations imple-
6
menting section 202 that are ‘the same as substantive reg-
7
ulations promulgated by the Secretary of Labor to imple-
8
ment the statutory provisions referred to in subsection (a) 
9
øof section 202 of the CAA¿ except insofar as the Board 
10
may determine, for good cause shown . . . that a modifica-
11
tion of such regulations would be more effective for the 
12
implementation of the rights and protections under this 
13
section.’. The regulations issued by the Board herein are 
14
on all matters for which section 202 of the CAA requires 
15
regulations to be issued. Specifically, it is the Board’s con-
16
sidered judgment, based on the information available to 
17
it at the time of the promulgation of these regulations, 
18
that, with the exception of regulations adopted and set 
19
forth herein, there are no other ‘substantive regulations 
20
promulgated by the Secretary of Labor to implement the 
21
statutory provisions referred to in subsection (a) øof sec-
22
tion 202 of the CAA¿.’. 
23
‘‘(c) On December 20, 2019, Congress enacted the 
24
Federal Employee Paid Leave Act (subtitle A of title

LXXVI of division F of the National Defense Authoriza-
1
tion Act for Fiscal Year 2020, Public Law 116–92, De-
2
cember 20, 2019) (FEPLA). FEPLA amended the FMLA 
3
to allow most Federal employees, including eligible em-
4
ployees in the legislative branch, to substitute up to 12 
5
weeks of paid parental leave (PPL) for unpaid FMLA 
6
leave granted in connection with the birth of an employee’s 
7
son or daughter or for the placement of a son or daughter 
8
with an employee for adoption or foster care. 
9
In order to implement FEPLA in the legislative branch, 
10
the Board is amending its substantive FMLA regulations 
11
pursuant to the CAA rulemaking procedures set forth at 
12
sections 202(d) and 304 of the CAA. The Secretary of 
13
Labor has not promulgated FEPLA regulations, however, 
14
because FEPLA does not extend PPL to private sector 
15
employees or other employees directly covered by FMLA 
16
title I. The Board has determined that these cir-
17
cumstances constitute good cause for modification of its 
18
substantive FMLA regulations in order to effectively im-
19
plement FEPLA’s rights and protections to covered em-
20
ployees in the legislative branch. 
21
‘‘(d) In promulgating these regulations, the Board 
22
has made certain technical and nomenclature changes to 
23
the regulations as promulgated by the Secretary. Such 
24
changes are intended to make the provisions adopted ac-
25
02:41 Dec 13, 2022
HR1516
5 
•HRES 1516 IH 
cord more naturally to situations in the legislative branch. 
1
However, by making these changes, the Board does not 
2
intend a substantive difference between these regulations 
3
and those of the Secretary from which they are derived. 
4
Moreover, such changes, in and of themselves, are not in-
5
tended to constitute an interpretation of the regulation or 
6
of the statutory provisions of the CAA upon which they 
7
are based. 
8
‘‘(e) Pursuant to section 304(b)(4) of the CAA, (2 
9
U.S.C. 1384(b)(4)), the Board of Directors is required to 
10
recommend to Congress a method of approval for these 
11
regulations. As the Board has adopted the same regula-
12
tions for the Senate, the House of Representatives, and 
13
the other covered entities and facilities, it therefore rec-
14
ommends that the adopted regulations be approved by 
15
concurrent resolution of the Congress.

earned or accrued it, for up to a total of 12 workweeks

of a child and to care for the newborn child, because of 
3
the placement of a child with the employee for adoption 
4
or foster care, because the employee is needed to care for 
5
a family member (child, spouse, or parent) with a serious 
6

7
health condition makes the employee unable to perform 
8
the functions of his or her job, or because of any qualifying 
9
exigency arising out of the fact that the employee’s spouse, 
10
son, daughter, or parent is a military member on active 
11
duty or call to covered active duty status (or has been noti-
12
fied of an impending call or order to covered active duty). 
13
In addition, eligible employees of a covered employing of-
14
fice may take job-protected, unpaid leave, or substitute ap-
15
propriate paid leave if the employee has earned or accrued 
16
it, for up to a total of 26 workweeks in a single 12–month 
17
period to care for a covered servicemember with a serious 
18
injury or illness. In certain cases, FMLA leave may be 
19
taken on an intermittent basis rather than all at once, or 
20
the employee may work a part-time schedule. 
21
‘‘(b) An employee on FMLA leave is also entitled to 
22
have health benefits maintained while on leave as if the 
23
employee had continued to work instead of taking the 
24
leave. If an employee was paying all or part of the pre-
25
02:41 Dec 13, 2022
HR1516
7 
•HRES 1516 IH 
mium payments prior to leave, the employee would con-
1
tinue to pay his or her share during the leave period. Sub-
2
ject to 825.208(k), the employing office or a disbursing 
3
or other financial office may recover its share only if the 
4
employee does not return to work for a reason other than 
5
the serious health condition of the employee or the employ-
6
ee’s covered family member, the serious injury or illness 
7
of a covered servicemember, or another reason beyond the 
8
employee’s control. 
9
‘‘(c) An employee generally has a right to return to 
10
the same position or an equivalent position with equivalent 
11
pay, benefits, and working conditions at the conclusion of 
12
the leave. The taking of FMLA leave cannot result in the 
13
loss of any benefit that accrued prior to the start of the 
14
leave. 
15
‘‘(d) The employing office generally has a right to ad-
16
vance notice from the employee. In addition, the employing 
17
office may require an employee to submit certification to 
18
substantiate that the leave is due to the serious health 
19
condition of the employee or the employee’s covered family 
20
member, due to the serious injury or illness of a covered 
21
servicemember, or because of a qualifying exigency. Fail-
22
ure to comply with these requirements may result in a 
23
delay in the start of FMLA leave. Pursuant to a uniformly 
24
applied policy, the employing office may also require that 
25
02:41 Dec 13, 2022
HR1516
8 
•HRES 1516 IH 
an employee present a certification of fitness to return to 
1
work when the absence was caused by the employee’s seri-
2
ous health condition (See 825.312 and 825.313)). The em-
3
ploying office may delay restoring the employee to employ-
4
ment without such certificate relating to the health condi-
5
tion which caused the employee’s absence. 
6
‘‘§ 825.101 Purpose of the FMLA 
7
‘‘(a) FMLA is intended to allow employees to balance 
8
their work and family life by taking reasonable unpaid 
9
leave for medical reasons, for the birth or adoption of a 
10
child, for the care of a child, spouse, or parent who has 
11
a serious health condition, for the care of a covered serv-
12
icemember with a serious injury or illness, or because of 
13
a qualifying exigency arising out of the fact that the em-
14
ployee’s spouse, son, daughter, or parent is a military 
15
member on covered active duty or call to covered active 
16
duty status. The FMLA is intended to balance the de-
17
mands of the workplace with the needs of families, to pro-
18
mote the stability and economic security of families, and 
19
to promote national interests in preserving family integ-
20
rity. It was intended that the FMLA accomplish these 
21
purposes in a manner that accommodates the legitimate 
22
interests of employing offices, and in a manner consistent 
23
with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth 
24
Amendment in minimizing the potential for employment 
25

•HRES 1516 IH 
discrimination on the basis of sex, while promoting equal 
1
employment opportunity for men and women. 
2
‘‘(b) The FMLA was predicated on two fundamental 
3
concerns—the needs of the American workforce, and the 
4
development of high-performance organizations. Increas-
5
ingly, America’s children and elderly are dependent upon 
6
family members who must spend long hours at work. 
7
When a family emergency arises, requiring workers to at-
8
tend to seriously-ill children or parents, or to newly-born 
9
or adopted infants, or even to their own serious illness, 
10
workers need reassurance that they will not be asked to 
11
choose between continuing their employment, and meeting 
12
their personal and family obligations or tending to vital 
13
needs at home. 
14
‘‘(c) The FMLA is both intended and expected to 
15
benefit employing offices as well as their employees. A di-
16
rect correlation exists between stability in the family and 
17
productivity in the workplace. FMLA will encourage the 
18
development of high-performance organizations. When 
19
workers can count on durable links to their workplace they 
20
are able to make their own full commitments to their jobs. 
21
The record of hearings on family and medical leave indi-
22
cate the powerful productive advantages of stable work-
23
place relationships, and the comparatively small costs of 
24
guaranteeing that those relationships will not be dissolved

If an employee used four weeks beginning February 1,

cumstances. Intermittent leave is FMLA leave taken in 
1
separate blocks of time due to a single qualifying reason. 
2
A reduced leave schedule is a leave schedule that reduces 
3
an employee’s usual number of working hours per work-
4
week, or hours per workday. A reduced leave schedule is 
5
a change in the employee’s schedule for a period of time,

‘‘(b) Medical necessity. For intermittent leave or leave 
8
on a reduced leave schedule taken because of one’s own

serious health condition, to care for a spouse, parent, son, 
10
or daughter with a serious health condition, or to care for 
11
a covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness, 
12
there must be a medical need for leave and it must be 
13
that such medical need can be best accommodated through 
14
an intermittent or reduced leave schedule. The treatment 
15

21
duced leave schedule when medically necessary for planned

4
physical impossibility exception, and 825.600 and 825.601

for special rules applicable to employees of schools. If an 
6
employing office uses different increments to account for 
7
different types of leave, the employing office must account 
8
for FMLA leave in the smallest increment used to account 
9
for any other type of leave. For example, if an employing 
10
office accounts for the use of annual leave in increments 
11
of one hour and the use of sick leave in increments of 
12
one-half hour, then FMLA leave use must be accounted 
13
for using increments no larger than one-half hour. If an 
14
employing office accounts for use of leave in varying incre-
15
ments at different times of the day or shift, the employing 
16
office may also account for FMLA leave in varying incre-
17
ments, provided that the increment used for FMLA leave 
18
is no greater than the smallest increment used for any 
19
other type of leave during the period in which the FMLA

leave is taken. If an employing office accounts for other

23
in increments no greater than one hour. An employing of-

•HRES 1516 IH 
than used for other forms of leave. For example, an em-
1
ploying office that accounts for other forms of leave in 
2
one hour increments may account for FMLA leave in a 
3
shorter increment when the employee arrives at work sev-
4
eral minutes late, and the employing office wants the em-
5

6
FMLA leave will not alter the increment considered to be

‘‘(b) Calculation of leave. (1) When an employee takes 
5
leave on an intermittent or reduced leave schedule, only 
6
the amount of leave actually taken may be counted toward 
7
the employee’s leave entitlement. The actual workweek is 
8
the basis of leave entitlement. Therefore, if an employee 
9
who would otherwise work 40 hours a week takes off eight 
10
hours, the employee would use one-fifth (1/5) of a week 
11
of FMLA leave. Similarly, if a full-time employee who 
12
would otherwise work eight-hour days works four-hour 
13
days under a reduced leave schedule, the employee would 
14
use one half (1/2) week of FMLA leave each week. Where 
15
an employee works a part-time schedule or variable hours, 
16
the amount of FMLA leave that an employee uses is deter-
17
mined on a pro rata or proportional basis. If an employee 
18

19
only 20 hours a week under a reduced leave schedule, the 
20
employee’s 10 hours of leave would constitute one-third

22
works the reduced leave schedule. An employing office may 
23
convert these fractions to their hourly equivalent so long 
24
as the conversion equitably reflects the employee’s total

3
weeks of leave, or 26 workweeks in the case of military

5
in those workweeks is necessarily dependent on the specific

including privileges, prerequisites, and status. It must in-

or equivalent pay premiums, such as a shift differential. 
3
If an employee departed from a position averaging ten 
4
hours of overtime (and corresponding overtime pay) each 
5
week, an employee is ordinarily entitled to such a position 
6
on return from FMLA leave.

‘‘(2) Equivalent pay includes any bonus or pay-
8
ment, whether it is discretionary or non-discre-
9
tionary, made to employees consistent with the pro-
10
visions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section. However, 
11
if a bonus or other payment is based on the achieve-
12
ment of a specified goal such as hours worked, prod-

ucts sold or perfect attendance, and the employee 
14
has not met the goal due to FMLA leave, then the 
15
payment may be denied, unless otherwise paid to

9
have taken place during the period of FMLA leave

12
leave, an employee cannot be required to requalify

for any benefits the employee enjoyed before FMLA

personal leave to the extent not substituted for

with a year of service for vesting, contributions or 
4
participation purposes, an employee on unpaid 
5
FMLA leave on that date shall be deemed to have

been employed on that date. However, unpaid

FMLA leave periods need not be treated as credited 
8
service for purposes of benefit accrual, vesting and 
9
eligibility to participate.

‘‘(5) Employees on unpaid FMLA leave are to 
11
be treated as if they continued to work for purposes 
12
of changes to benefit plans. They are entitled to 
13
changes in benefits plans, except those which may be 
14
dependent upon seniority or accrual during the leave 
15
period, immediately upon return from leave or to the 
16
same extent they would have qualified if no leave 
17
had been taken. For example if the benefit plan is 
18
predicated on a pre-established number of hours 
19
worked each year and the employee does not have 
20
sufficient hours as a result of taking unpaid FMLA 
21

within the meaning of the Board’s FLSA regulations at 
13
part 541, implementing section 203 of the CAA (2 U.S.C.

‘‘§ 825.218 Substantial and grievous economic injury

‘‘(a) In order to deny restoration to a key employee, 
13
an employing office must determine that the restoration 
14

15
grievous economic injury to the operations of the employ-

4
tained. If the reinstatement of a key employee threatens 
5
the economic viability of the employing office, that would 
6
constitute substantial and grievous economic injury. A 
7
lesser injury which causes substantial, long-term economic 
8
injury would also be sufficient. Minor inconveniences and

8
most circumstances there will be no desire that an em-

prior to the employee starting leave. The employing office 
1
must serve this notice either in person or by certified mail. 
2
This notice must explain the basis for the employing of-

fice’s finding that substantial and grievous economic in-
4
jury will result, and, if leave has commenced, must provide 
5
the employee a reasonable time in which to return to work,

taking into account the circumstances, such as the length 
7
of the leave and the urgency of the need for the employee 
8
to return.

‘‘(c) If an employee on leave does not return to work

in response to the employing office’s notification of intent

to deny restoration, the employee continues to be entitled

may not recover its cost of health benefit premiums. A

until the employee either gives notice that he or she no 
16

‘‘(d) After notice to an employee has been given that

based on the facts at that time. If it is determined that

‘‘§ 825.220 Protection for employees who request

‘‘(a) The FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, 
9
prohibits interference with an employee’s rights under the 
10
law, and with legal proceedings or inquiries relating to an 
11
employee’s rights. More specifically, the law contains the 
12
following employee protections: 
13
‘‘(1) An employing office is prohibited from 
14
interfering with, restraining, or denying the exercise 
15
of (or attempts to exercise) any rights provided by 
16
the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA. 
17
‘‘(2) An employing office is prohibited from dis-
18
charging or in any other way discriminating against 
19
any covered employee (whether or not an eligible em-
20
ployee) for opposing or complaining about any un-
21
lawful practice under the FMLA, as made applicable 
22
by the CAA.

‘‘(3) All employing offices are prohibited from

discharging or in any other way discriminating

caused to be instituted) any proceeding under 
4
or related to the FMLA, as made applicable by 
5
the CAA;

‘‘(B) Given, or is about to give, any infor-
7
mation in connection with an inquiry or pro-
8
ceeding relating to a right under the FMLA, as 
9
made applicable by the CAA;

any inquiry or proceeding relating to a right 
12
under the FMLA, as made applicable by the 
13
CAA.

‘‘(b) Any violations of the FMLA, as made applicable 
15
by the CAA, or of these regulations constitute interfering 
16
with, restraining, or denying the exercise of rights pro-
17
vided by the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA. An 
18
employing office may be liable for compensation and bene-
19
fits lost by reason of the violation, for other actual mone-
20
tary losses sustained as a direct result of the violation, 
21
and for appropriate equitable or other relief, including em-
22
ployment, reinstatement, promotion, or any other relief 
23
tailored to the harm suffered. See 825.400(b). Interfering 
24
with the exercise of an employee’s rights would include, 
25
02:41 Dec 13, 2022
HR1516
157 
•HRES 1516 IH 
for example, not only refusing to authorize FMLA leave, 
1
but discouraging an employee from using such leave. It 
2
would also include manipulation by a covered employing 
3
office to avoid responsibilities under FMLA, for example: 
4
‘‘(1) øReserved¿ 
5
‘‘(2) Changing the essential functions of the job 
6
in order to preclude the taking of leave; or 
7
‘‘(3) Reducing hours available to work in order 
8
to avoid employee eligibility. 
9
‘‘(c) The FMLA’s prohibition against interference 
10
prohibits an employing office from discriminating or re-
11
taliating against an employee or prospective employee for 
12
having exercised or attempted to exercise FMLA rights. 
13
For example, if an employee on leave without pay would 
14
otherwise be entitled to full benefits (other than health 
15
benefits), the same benefits would be required to be pro-
16
vided to an employee on unpaid FMLA leave. By the same 
17
token, employing offices cannot use the taking of FMLA 
18
leave as a negative factor in employment actions, such as 
19
hiring, promotions or disciplinary actions; nor can FMLA 
20
leave be counted under no fault attendance policies. See 
21
825.215. 
22
‘‘(d) Employees cannot waive, nor may employing of-
23
fices induce employees to waive, their rights under FMLA.

1
leave against some other benefit offered by the employing 
2
office. Except for settlement agreements covered by 1414 
3
and/or 1415 of the Congressional Accountability Act, this 
4
does not prevent the settlement or release of FMLA claims 
5
by employees based on past employing office conduct with-
6
out the approval of the Office of Congressional Workplace 
7
Rights or a court. Nor does it prevent an employee’s vol-
8
untary and uncoerced acceptance (not as a condition of 
9
employment) of a light duty assignment while recovering 
10
from a serious health condition. See 825.702(d). An em-
11
ployee’s acceptance of such light duty assignment does not 
12
constitute a waiver of the employee’s prospective rights, 
13
including the right to be restored to the same position the 
14
employee held at the time the employee’s FMLA leave 
15
commenced or to an equivalent position. The employee’s 
16
right to restoration, however, ceases at the end of the ap-
17
plicable 12-month FMLA leave year.

‘‘(e) Covered employees, and not merely eligible em-

ployees, are protected from retaliation for opposing (e.g., 
20
filing a complaint about) any practice which is unlawful

under the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA. They

‘‘(d) Designation notice. (1) The employing office is 
15
responsible in all circumstances for designating leave as 
16
FMLA-qualifying, and for giving notice of the designation 
17
to the employee as provided in this section. When the em-
18
ploying office has enough information to determine wheth-
19
er the leave is being taken for a FMLA-qualifying reason 
20
(e.g., after receiving a certification), the employing office 
21
must notify the employee whether the leave will be des-
22
ignated and will be counted as FMLA leave within five 
23
business days absent extenuating circumstances. Only one 
24
notice of designation is required for each FMLA-quali-

fying reason per applicable 12-month period, regardless of 
1
whether the leave taken due to the qualifying reason will 
2
be a continuous block of leave or intermittent or reduced 
3
schedule leave. If the employing office determines that the 
4
leave will not be designated as FMLA-qualifying (e.g., if 
5
the leave is not for a reason covered by FMLA or the 
6
FMLA leave entitlement has been exhausted), the employ-
7
ing office must notify the employee of that determination. 
8
Subject to 825.208, if the employing office requires paid 
9
leave to be substituted for unpaid FMLA leave, or that 
10
paid leave taken under an existing leave plan be counted 
11
as FMLA leave, the employing office must inform the em-
12
ployee of this designation at the time of designating the 
13
FMLA leave. 
14
‘‘(2) If the employing office has sufficient infor-
15
mation to designate the leave as FMLA leave imme-
16
diately after receiving notice of the employee’s need 
17
for leave, the employing office may provide the em-
18
ployee with the designation notice at that time. 
19
‘‘(3) If the employing office will require the em-
20
ployee to present a fitness-for-duty certification to 
21
be restored to employment, the employing office 
22
must provide notice of such requirement with the 
23
designation notice. If the employing office will re-
24
quire that the fitness-for-duty certification address

the employee’s ability to perform the essential func-
1
tions of the employee’s position, the employing office 
2
must so indicate in the designation notice, and must 
3
include a list of the essential functions of the em-
4
ployee’s position. See 825.312. If the employing of-
5
fice’s handbook or other written documents (if any) 
6
describing the employing office’s leave policies clear-
7
ly provide that a fitness-for- duty certification will be 
8
required in specific circumstances (e.g., by stating 
9
that fitness- for-duty certification will be required in 
10
all cases of back injuries for employees in a certain 
11
occupation), the employing office is not required to 
12
provide written notice of the requirement with the 
13
designation notice, but must provide oral notice no 
14
later than with the designation notice. 
15
‘‘(4) The designation notice must be in writing. 
16
A prototype designation notice is contained in Form 
17
D which may be obtained from the Office of Con-
18
gressional Workplace Rights. If the leave is not des-
19
ignated as FMLA leave because it does not meet the 
20
requirements of the FMLA, as made applicable by 
21
the CAA, the notice to the employee that the leave 
22
is not designated as FMLA leave may be in the form 
23
of a simple written statement. The designation no-
24
tice may be distributed electronically so long as it

•HRES 1516 IH 
otherwise meets the requirements of this section and 
1
the employing office can demonstrate that the em-
2
ployee (who may already be on leave and who may 
3
not have access to employing office-provided com-
4
puters) has access to the information electronically. 
5
‘‘(5) If the information provided by the employ-
6
ing office to the employee in the designation notice 
7
changes (e.g., the employee exhausts the FMLA 
8
leave entitlement), the employing office shall provide, 
9
within five business days of receipt of the employee’s 
10
first notice of need for leave subsequent to any 
11
change, written notice of the change. 
12
‘‘(6) The employing office must notify the em-
13
ployee of the amount of leave counted against the 
14
employee’s FMLA leave entitlement and, if applica-
15
ble, the employee’s paid parental leave entitlement. 
16
If the amount of leave needed is known at the time 
17
the employing office designates the leave as FMLA- 
18
qualifying, the employing office must notify the em-
19
ployee of the number of hours, days, or weeks that 
20
will be counted against the employee’s FMLA leave 
21
entitlement in the designation notice. If it is not pos-
22
sible to provide the hours, days, or weeks that will 
23
be counted against the employee’s FMLA leave enti-
24
tlement (such as in the case of unforeseeable inter-

1
vide notice of the amount of leave counted against 
2
the employee’s FMLA leave entitlement and, if ap-
3
plicable, paid parental leave entitlement, upon the 
4
request by the employee, but no more often than 
5
once in a 30–day period and only if leave was taken 
6
in that period. The notice of the amount of leave 
7
counted against the employee’s FMLA entitlement 
8
and, if applicable, paid parental leave entitlement 
9
may be oral or in writing. If such notice is oral, it 
10
shall be confirmed in writing no later than the fol-
11
lowing payday (unless the payday is less than one 
12
week after the oral notice, in which case the notice 
13
must be no later than the subsequent payday). Such 
14
written notice may be in any form, including a nota-
15
tion on the employee’s pay stub. 
16
‘‘(e) Consequences of failing to provide notice. Failure 
17
to follow the notice requirements set forth in this section 
18
may constitute an interference with, restraint, or denial 
19
of the exercise of an employee’s FMLA rights. An employ-
20
ing office may be liable for compensation and benefits lost 
21
by reason of the violation, for other actual monetary losses 
22
sustained as a direct result of the violation, and for appro-
23

‘‘§ 825.301 Designation of FMLA leave 
3
‘‘(a) Employing office responsibilities. The employing 
4
office’s decision to designate leave as FMLA-qualifying 
5
must be based only on information received from the em-
6
ployee or the employee’s spokesperson (e.g., if the em-
7
ployee is incapacitated, the employee’s spouse, adult child, 
8
parent, doctor, etc., may provide notice to the employing 
9
office of the need to take FMLA leave). In any cir-
10
cumstance where the employing office does not have suffi-
11
cient information about the reason for an employee’s use 
12
of leave, the employing office should inquire further of the 
13
employee or the spokesperson to ascertain whether leave 
14
is potentially FMLA-qualifying. Once the employing office 
15
has acquired knowledge that the leave is being taken for 
16
a FMLA-qualifying reason, the employing office must no-
17
tify the employee as provided in 825.300(d). 
18
‘‘(b) Employee responsibilities. An employee giving 
19
notice of the need for FMLA leave does not need to ex-
20
pressly assert rights under the FMLA, as made applicable 
21
by the CAA, or even mention the FMLA to meet his or 
22
her obligation to provide notice, though the employee 
23
would need to state a qualifying reason for the needed 
24
leave and otherwise satisfy the notice requirements set 
25
02:41 Dec 13, 2022
HR1516
171 
•HRES 1516 IH 
forth in 825.302 or 825.303 depending on whether the 
1
need for leave is foreseeable or unforeseeable. An employee 
2
giving notice of the need for FMLA leave must explain 
3
the reasons for the needed leave so as to allow the employ-
4
ing office to determine whether the leave qualifies under 
5
the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA. If the em-
6
ployee fails to explain the reasons, leave may be denied. 
7
In many cases, in explaining the reasons for a request to 
8
use leave, especially when the need for the leave was unex-
9
pected or unforeseen, an employee will provide sufficient 
10
information for the employing office to designate the leave 
11
as FMLA leave. An employee using accrued paid leave 
12
may in some cases not spontaneously explain the reasons 
13
or their plans for using their accrued leave. However, if 
14
an employee requesting to use paid leave for a FMLA- 
15
qualifying reason does not explain the reason for the leave 
16
and the employing office denies the employee’s request, 
17
the employee will need to provide sufficient information 
18
to establish a FMLA-qualifying reason for the needed 
19
leave so that the employing office is aware that the leave 
20
may not be denied and may designate that the paid leave 
21
be appropriately counted against (substituted for) the em-
22
ployee’s FMLA leave entitlement. Similarly, an employee 
23
using accrued paid vacation leave who seeks an extension 
24
of unpaid leave for a FMLA-qualifying reason will need 
25
02:41 Dec 13, 2022
HR1516
172 
•HRES 1516 IH 
to state the reason. If this is due to an event which oc-
1
curred during the period of paid leave, the employing of-
2
fice may count the leave used after the FMLA-qualifying 
3
reason against the employee’s FMLA leave entitlement. 
4
‘‘(c) Disputes. If there is a dispute between an em-
5
ploying office and an employee as to whether leave quali-
6
fies as FMLA leave, it should be resolved through discus-
7
sions between the employee and the employing office. Such 
8
discussions and the decision must be documented. 
9
‘‘(d) Retroactive designation. Subject to 825.208, if 
10
an employing office does not designate leave as required 
11
by 825.300, the employing office may retroactively des-
12
ignate leave as FMLA leave with appropriate notice to the 
13
employee as required by 825.300 provided that the em-
14
ploying office’s failure to timely designate leave does not 
15
cause harm or injury to the employee. In all cases where 
16
leave would qualify for FMLA protections, an employing 
17
office and an employee can mutually agree that leave be 
18
retroactively designated as FMLA leave. 
19
‘‘(e) Remedies. If an employing office’s failure to 
20
timely designate leave in accordance with 825.300 causes 
21
the employee to suffer harm, it may constitute an inter-
22
ference with, restraint of, or denial of the exercise of an 
23
employee’s FMLA rights. An employing office may be lia-
24
ble for compensation and benefits lost by reason of the 
25
02:41 Dec 13, 2022
HR1516
173 
•HRES 1516 IH 
violation, for other actual monetary losses sustained as a 
1
direct result of the violation, and for appropriate equitable 
2
or other relief, including employment, reinstatement, pro-
3
motion, or any other relief tailored to the harm suffered. 
4
See 825.400(b). For example, if an employing office that 
5
was put on notice that an employee needed FMLA leave 
6
failed to designate the leave properly, but the employee’s 
7
own serious health condition prevented him or her from 
8
returning to work during that time period regardless of 
9
the designation, an employee may not be able to show that 
10
the employee suffered harm as a result of the employing 
11
office’s actions. However, if an employee took leave to pro-
12
vide care for a son or daughter with a serious health condi-
13
tion believing it would not count toward his or her FMLA 
14
entitlement, and the employee planned to later use that 
15
FMLA leave to provide care for a spouse who would need 
16
assistance when recovering from surgery planned for a 
17
later date, the employee may be able to show that harm 
18
has occurred as a result of the employing office’s failure 
19
to designate properly. The employee might establish this 
20
by showing that he or she would have arranged for an 
21
alternative caregiver for the seriously-ill son or daughter 
22
if the leave had been designated timely.

‘‘§ 825.302 Employee notice requirements for foresee-
1
able FMLA leave 
2
‘‘(a) Timing of notice. An employee must provide the 
3
employing office at least 30 days advance notice before 
4
FMLA leave is to begin if the need for the leave is foresee-
5
able based on an expected birth, placement for adoption 
6
or foster care, planned medical treatment for a serious 
7
health condition of the employee or of a family member, 
8
or the planned medical treatment for a serious injury or 
9
illness of a covered servicemember. If 30 days’ notice is 
10
not practicable, such as because of a lack of knowledge 
11
of approximately when leave will be required to begin, a 
12
change in circumstances, or a medical emergency, notice 
13
must be given as soon as practicable. For example, an em-
14
ployee’s health condition may require leave to commence 
15
earlier than anticipated before the birth of a child. Simi-
16
larly, little opportunity for notice may be given before 
17
placement for adoption. For foreseeable leave due to a 
18
qualifying exigency, notice must be provided as soon as 
19
practicable, regardless of how far in advance such leave 
20
is foreseeable. Whether FMLA leave is to be continuous 
21
or is to be taken intermittently or on a reduced schedule 
22
basis, notice need only be given one time, but the employee 
23
shall advise the employing office as soon as practicable if 
24
dates of scheduled leave change or are extended, or were 
25
initially unknown. In those cases where the employee is 
26

HR1516
175 
•HRES 1516 IH 
required to provide at least 30 days’ notice of foreseeable 
1
leave and does not do so, the employee shall explain the 
2
reasons why such notice was not practicable upon a re-
3
quest from the employing office for such information. 
4
‘‘(b) As soon as practicable means as soon as both 
5
possible and practical, taking into account all of the facts 
6
and circumstances in the individual case. When an em-
7
ployee becomes aware of a need for FMLA leave less than 
8
30 days in advance, it should be practicable for the em-
9
ployee to provide notice of the need for leave either the 
10
same day or the next business day. In all cases, however, 
11
the determination of when an employee could practicably 
12
provide notice must take into account the individual facts 
13
and circumstances. 
14
‘‘(c) Content of notice. An employee shall provide at 
15
least verbal notice sufficient to make the employing office 
16
aware that the employee needs FMLA-qualifying leave, 
17
and the anticipated timing and duration of the leave. De-
18
pending on the situation, such information may include 
19
that a condition renders the employee unable to perform

the functions of the job; that the employee is pregnant 
21
or has been hospitalized overnight; whether the employee 
22
or the employee’s family member is under the continuing

care of a health care provider; if the leave is due to a 
24
qualifying exigency, that a military member is on covered

active duty or call to covered active duty status (or has 
1
been notified of an impending call or order to covered ac-
2

3
reasons listed in 825.126(b); if the leave is for a family

member, that the condition renders the family member un-
5
able to perform daily activities, or that the family member 
6
is a covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness; 
7
and the anticipated duration of the absence, if known. 
8
When an employee seeks leave for the first time for a 
9
FMLA-qualifying reason, the employee need not expressly 
10
assert rights under the FMLA, as made applicable by the 
11
CAA, or even mention the FMLA. When an employee 
12
seeks leave due to a FMLA-qualifying reason, for which 
13
the employing office has previously provided FMLA-pro-
14
tected leave, the employee must specifically reference the 
15
qualifying reason for leave or the need for FMLA leave. 
16
In all cases, the employing office should inquire further 
17
of the employee if it is necessary to have more information 
18
about whether FMLA leave is being sought by the em-
19
ployee, and obtain the necessary details of the leave to be 
20
taken. In the case of medical conditions, the employing 
21
office may find it necessary to inquire further to determine 
22
if the leave is because of a serious health condition and 
23
may request medical certification to support the need for 
24
such leave. See 825.305. An employing office may also re-
25
02:41 Dec 13, 2022
HR1516
177 
•HRES 1516 IH 
quest certification to support the need for leave for a 
1
qualifying exigency or for military caregiver leave. See 
2
825.309, 825.310. When an employee has been previously 
3
certified for leave due to more than one FMLA-qualifying 
4
reason, the employing office may need to inquire further 
5
to determine for which qualifying reason the leave is need-
6
ed. An employee has an obligation to respond to an em-
7
ploying office’s questions designed to determine whether 
8
an absence is potentially FMLA-qualifying. Failure to re-
9
spond to reasonable employing office inquiries regarding 
10
the leave request may result in denial of FMLA protection 
11
if the employing office is unable to determine whether the 
12
leave is FMLA-qualifying. 
13
‘‘(d) Complying with the employing office policy. An 
14
employing office may require an employee to comply with 
15
the employing office’s usual and customary notice and pro-
16
cedural requirements for requesting leave, absent unusual 
17
circumstances. For example, an employing office may re-
18
quire that written notice set forth the reasons for the re-
19
quested leave, the anticipated duration of the leave, and 
20
the anticipated start of the leave. An employee also may 
21
be required by an employing office’s policy to contact a 
22
specific individual. Unusual circumstances would include 
23
situations such as when an employee is unable to comply 
24
with the employing office’s policy that requests for leave 
25
02:41 Dec 13, 2022
HR1516
178 
•HRES 1516 IH 
should be made by contacting a specific number because 
1
on the day the employee needs to provide notice of his 
2
or her need for FMLA leave there is no one to answer 
3
the call-in number and the voice mail box is full. Where 
4
an employee does not comply with the employing office’s 
5
usual notice and procedural requirements, and no unusual 
6
circumstances justify the failure to comply, FMLA-pro-
7
tected leave may be delayed or denied. However, FMLA- 
8
protected leave may not be delayed or denied where the 
9
employing office’s policy requires notice to be given sooner 
10
than set forth in paragraph (a) of this section and the 
11
employee provides timely notice as set forth in paragraph 
12
(a) of this section.

‘‘(e) Scheduling planned medical treatment. When 
14
planning medical treatment, the employee must consult

with the employing office and make a reasonable effort 
16
to schedule the treatment so as not to disrupt unduly the 
17
employing office’s operations, subject to the approval of 
18
the health care provider. Employees are ordinarily ex-

pected to consult with their employing offices prior to the

scheduling of treatment in order to work out a treatment

schedule which best suits the needs of both the employing

and require the employee to attempt to make such ar-

The employee and employing office shall attempt to work

time prescribed by the employing office’s usual and cus-
4
tomary notice requirements applicable to such leave. See

825.303(c). Notice may be given by the employee’s spokes-
6
person (e.g., spouse, adult family member, or other re-
7
sponsible party) if the employee is unable to do so person-
8
ally. For example, if an employee’s child has a severe asth-
9
ma attack and the employee takes the child to the emer-
10
gency room, the employee would not be required to leave 
11
his or her child in order to report the absence while the 
12
child is receiving emergency treatment. However, if the

child’s asthma attack required only the use of an inhaler

perform daily activities or that the family member is a

covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness; and 
10
the anticipated duration of the absence, if known. When 
11
an employee seeks leave for the first time for a FMLA- 
12
qualifying reason, the employee need not expressly assert 
13
rights under the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, 
14
or even mention the FMLA. When an employee seeks leave 
15
due to a qualifying reason, for which the employing office 
16
has previously provided the employee FMLA-protected 
17
leave, the employee must specifically reference either the 
18
qualifying reason for leave or the need for FMLA leave. 
19
Calling in ‘sick’ without providing more information will 
20
not be considered sufficient notice to trigger an employing 
21
office’s obligations under the FMLA, as made applicable 
22
by the CAA. The employing office will be expected to ob-
23
tain any additional required information through informal 
24
means. An employee has an obligation to respond to an

employing office’s questions designed to determine wheth-

er an absence is potentially FMLA-qualifying. Failure to 
2
respond to reasonable employing office inquiries office re-
3
garding the leave request may result in denial of FMLA 
4
protection if the employing office is unable to determine 
5
whether the leave is FMLA-qualifying.

‘‘(c) Complying with employing office policy. When 
7
the need for leave is not foreseeable, an employee must 
8
comply with the employing office’s usual and customary 
9
notice and procedural requirements for requesting leave, 
10
absent unusual circumstances. For example, an employing 
11
office may require employees to call a designated number 
12
or a specific individual to request leave. However, if an 
13
employee requires emergency medical treatment, he or she 
14
would not be required to follow the call-in procedure until 
15
his or her condition is stabilized and he or she has access 
16
to, and is able to use, a phone. Similarly, in the case of 
17
an emergency requiring leave because of a FMLA-quali-
18
fying reason, written advance notice pursuant to an em-
19
ploying office’s internal rules and procedures may not be 
20
required when FMLA leave is involved. If an employee 
21
does not comply with the employing office’s usual notice 
22
and procedural requirements, and no unusual cir-
23
cumstances justify the failure to comply, FMLA-protected 
24

1
‘‘(a) Proper notice required. In all cases, in order for

the onset of an employee’s FMLA leave to be delayed due 
3
to lack of required notice, it must be clear that the em-
4
ployee had actual notice of the FMLA notice require-
5

6
office’s proper posting, at the worksite where the employee 
7
is employed, of the information regarding the FMLA pro-
8
vided (pursuant to section 301(h)(2) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C.

FMLA leave is foreseeable at least 30 days in advance 
14
and an employee fails to give timely advance notice with

no reasonable excuse, the employing office may delay

20
example, knowledge that an employee would receive a tele-

02:41 Dec 13, 2022
HR1516
186 
•HRES 1516 IH 
a certification, as described in 825.309 and 825.310, re-
1
spectively. An employing office must give notice of a re-
2
quirement for certification each time a certification is re-
3
quired; such notice must be written notice whenever re-
4
quired by 825.300(c). An employing office’s oral request 
5
to an employee to furnish any subsequent certification is 
6
sufficient. 
7
‘‘(b) Timing. In most cases, the employing office 
8
should request that an employee furnish certification at 
9
the time the employee gives notice of the need for leave 
10
or within five business days thereafter, or, in the case of 
11
unforeseen leave, within five business days after the leave 
12
commences. The employing office may request certifi-
13
cation at some later date if the employing office later has 
14
reason to question the appropriateness of the leave or its 
15
duration. The employee must provide the requested certifi-
16
cation to the employing office within 15 calendar days 
17
after the employing office’s request, unless it is not prac-
18
ticable under the particular circumstances to do so despite

187 
•HRES 1516 IH 
in accordance with 825.306, 825.309, and 825.310. The 
1
employing office shall advise an employee whenever the 
2
employing office finds a certification incomplete or insuffi-
3
cient, and shall state in writing what additional informa-
4
tion is necessary to make the certification complete and 
5
sufficient. A certification is considered incomplete if the 
6
employing office receives a certification, but one or more 
7
of the applicable entries have not been completed. A cer-
8
tification is considered insufficient if the employing office 
9
receives a complete certification, but the information pro-
10
vided is vague, ambiguous, or non-responsive. The employ-
11
ing office must provide the employee with seven calendar 
12
days (unless not practicable under the particular cir-
13
cumstances despite the employee’s diligent good faith ef-
14
forts) to cure any such deficiency. If the deficiencies speci-
15
fied by the employing office are not cured in the resub-
16
mitted certification, the employing office may deny the 
17
taking of FMLA leave, in accordance with 825.313. A cer-
18

3
this section, or fails to provide any certification, the em-
4
ploying office may deny the taking of FMLA leave, in ac-
5
cordance with 825.313. It is the employee’s responsibility

or the employee’s family member in order for the health

13
not be designated as FMLA leave and may be treated as

ployee to obtain certification from a third health care pro-

opinion shall be final and binding. The third health care

2
the other hand, an employing office that refuses to agree 
3
to any doctor on a list of specialists in the appropriate 
4
field provided by the employee and whom the employee 
5
has not previously consulted may be failing to act in good 
6
faith. In addition, the consequences set forth in 
7
825.305(d) will apply if the employee or the employee’s 
8
family member fails to authorize his or her health care 
9
provider to release all relevant medical information per-
10
taining to the serious health condition at issue if requested 
11
by the health care provider designated to provide a third 
12
opinion in order to render a sufficient and complete third 
13
opinion. 
14
‘‘(d) Copies of opinions. The employing office is re-
15
quired to provide the employee with a copy of the second 
16

by the employee. Requested copies are to be provided with-

21
the employee to obtain either a second or third opinion

ployee or family member to travel outside normal com-
2
muting distance for purposes of obtaining the second or 
3
third medical opinions except in very unusual cir-
4
cumstances. 
5
‘‘(f) Medical certification abroad. In circumstances in 
6
which the employee or a family member is visiting in an-
7
other country, or a family member resides in another 
8
country, and a serious health condition develops, the em-
9
ploying office shall accept a medical certification as well 
10
as second and third opinions from a health care provider 
11
who practices in that country. Where a certification by a 
12
foreign health care provider is in a language other than

with a written translation of the certification upon re-
15

‘‘(a) 30-day rule. An employing office may request re-
21
certification no more often than every 30 days and only 
22
in connection with an absence by the employee, unless 
23
paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section apply.

‘‘(b) More than 30 days. If the medical certification 
1
indicates that the minimum duration of the condition is 
2
more than 30 days, an employing office must wait until 
3
that minimum duration expires before requesting a recer-
4
tification, unless paragraph (c) of this section applies. For 
5
example, if the medical certification states that an em-
6
ployee will be unable to work, whether continuously or on 
7
an intermittent basis, for 40 days, the employing office 
8
must wait 40 days before requesting a recertification. In 
9
all cases, an employing office may request a recertification 
10
of a medical condition every six months in connection with 
11
an absence by the employee. Accordingly, even if the med-
12
ical certification indicates that the employee will need 
13
intermittent or reduced schedule leave for a period in ex-
14
cess of six months (e.g., for a lifetime condition), the em-
15
ploying office would be permitted to request recertification 
16
every six months in connection with an absence. 
17
‘‘(c) Less than 30 days. An employing office may re-
18
quest recertification in less than 30 days if: 
19
‘‘(1) The employee requests an extension of 
20
leave; 
21
‘‘(2) Circumstances described by the previous 
22
certification have changed significantly (e.g., the du-
23
ration or frequency of the absence, the nature or se-
24
verity of the illness, complications). For example, if 
25
02:41 Dec 13, 2022
HR1516

•HRES 1516 IH 
a medical certification stated that an employee 
1
would need leave for one to two days when the em-
2
ployee suffered a migraine headache and the employ-
3
ee’s absences for his or her last two migraines lasted 
4
four days each, then the increased duration of ab-
5
sence might constitute a significant change in cir-
6
cumstances allowing the employing office to request 
7
a recertification in less than 30 days. Likewise, if an 
8
employee had a pattern of using unscheduled FMLA 
9
leave for migraines in conjunction with his or her 
10
scheduled days off, then the timing of the absences 
11
also might constitute a significant change in cir-
12
cumstances sufficient for an employing office to re-
13
quest a recertification more frequently than every 30 
14
days; or 
15
‘‘(3) The employing office receives information 
16
that casts doubt upon the employee’s stated reason 
17
for the absence or the continuing validity of the cer-
18
tification. For example, if an employee is on FMLA 
19
leave for four weeks due to the employee’s knee sur-
20
gery, including recuperation, and the employee plays 
21
in company softball league games during the employ-
22
ee’s third week of FMLA leave, such information 
23
might be sufficient to cast doubt upon the con-
24
tinuing validity of the certification allowing the em-

2
‘‘(d) Timing. The employee must provide the re-
3
quested recertification to the employing office within the 
4
time frame requested by the employing office (which must 
5
allow at least 15 calendar days after the employing office’s 
6
request), unless it is not practicable under the particular 
7
circumstances to do so despite the employee’s diligent, 
8
good faith efforts. 
9
‘‘(e) Content. The employing office may ask for the 
10
same information when obtaining recertification as that 
11
permitted for the original certification as set forth in 
12
825.306. The employee has the same obligations to par-
13
ticipate and cooperate (including providing a complete and 
14
sufficient certification or adequate authorization to the

health care provider) in the recertification process as in 
16
the initial certification process. See 825.305(d). As part 
17
of the information allowed to be obtained on recertification

for leave taken because of a serious health condition, the 
19
employing office may provide the health care provider with 
20
a record of the employee’s absence pattern and ask the

need for leave is consistent with such a pattern.

For example, a provision of a collective bargaining agree-

employing office must make reasonable accommodations,

etc., barring undue hardship, in accordance with the ADA. 
10
At the same time, the employing office must afford an em-
11
ployee his or her FMLA rights, as made applicable by the 
12
CAA. ADA’s ‘disability’ and FMLA’s ‘serious health con-
13
dition’ are different concepts, and must be analyzed sepa-
14
rately. FMLA entitles eligible employees to 12 weeks of

19
to maintain employees’ group health plan coverage during 
20
FMLA leave on the same conditions as coverage would 
21
have been provided if the employee had been continuously 
22
employed during the leave period, whereas ADA does not

might be accomplished by providing an individual with a 
4
disability with a part-time job with no health benefits, as-
5
suming the employing office did not ordinarily provide 
6
health insurance for part-time employees. However, 
7
FMLA would permit an employee to work a reduced leave 
8
schedule until the equivalent of 12 workweeks of leave 
9
were used, with group health benefits maintained during 
10
this period. FMLA permits an employing office to tempo-
11
rarily transfer an employee who is taking leave intermit-
12
tently or on a reduced leave schedule to an alternative po-
13
sition, whereas the ADA allows an accommodation of reas-
14
signment to an equivalent, vacant position only if the em-

ployee cannot perform the essential functions of the em-
16
ployee’s present position and an accommodation is not

possible in the employee’s present position, or an accom-
18

an undue hardship. The examples in the following para-

interact with respect to a qualified individual with a dis-

ability.

requests 10 weeks of medical leave as a reasonable 
1
accommodation, which the employing office grants 
2
because it is not an undue hardship. The employing 
3
office advises the employee that the 10 weeks of 
4
leave is also being designated as FMLA leave and 
5
will count towards the employee’s FMLA leave enti-
6
tlement. This designation does not prevent the par-
7
ties from also treating the leave as a reasonable ac-
8
commodation and reinstating the employee into the 
9
same job, as required by the ADA, rather than an 
10
equivalent position under FMLA, if that is the 
11
greater right available to the employee. At the same 
12
time, the employee would be entitled under FMLA 
13
to have the employing office maintain group health 
14
plan coverage during the leave, as that requirement 
15
provides the greater right to the employee. 
16
‘‘(3) If the same employee needed to work part- 
17
time (a reduced leave schedule) after returning to 
18
his or her same job, the employee would still be enti-
19
tled under FMLA to have group health plan cov-
20
erage maintained for the remainder of the two-week 
21
equivalent of FMLA leave entitlement, notwith-
22
standing an employing office policy that part-time 
23
employees do not receive health insurance. This em-

able accommodations to enable the employee to per-
1
form the essential functions of the part-time posi-
2
tion. In addition, because the employee is working a 
3
part-time schedule as a reasonable accommodation, 
4
the FMLA’s provision for temporary assignment to 
5
a different alternative position would not apply. 
6
Once the employee has exhausted his or her remain-
7
ing FMLA leave entitlement while working the re-
8
duced (part-time) schedule, if the employee is a 
9
qualified individual with a disability, and if the em-
10
ployee is unable to return to the same full-time posi-
11
tion at that time, the employee might continue to 
12
work part-time as a reasonable accommodation, bar-
13
ring undue hardship; the employee would then be en-
14
titled to only those employment benefits ordinarily 
15
provided by the employing office to part-time em-
16
ployees. 
17
‘‘(4) At the end of the FMLA leave entitlement, 
18
an employing office is required under FMLA to rein-
19
state the employee in the same or an equivalent po-
20
sition, with equivalent pay and benefits, to that 
21
which the employee held when leave commenced. The 
22
employing office’s FMLA obligations would be satis-
23
fied if the employing office offered the employee an 
24
equivalent full-time position. If the employee were

3
the employing office to make a reasonable accommo-
4
dation at that time by allowing the employee to work 
5
part-time or by reassigning the employee to a vacant 
6
position, barring undue hardship. 
7
‘‘(d)(1) If FMLA entitles an employee to leave, an 
8
employing office may not, in lieu of FMLA leave entitle-
9
ment, require an employee to take a job with a reasonable 
10
accommodation. However, ADA may require that an em-

12
such a position. An employing office may not change the 
13
essential functions of the job in order to deny FMLA 
14
leave. See 825.220(b). 
15
‘‘(2) An employee may be on a workers’ com-
16
pensation absence due to an on-the-job injury or ill-
17
ness which also qualifies as a serious health condi-
18
tion under FMLA. The workers’ compensation ab-
19
sence and FMLA leave may run concurrently (sub-
20
ject to proper notice and designation by the employ-
21
ing office). At some point the health care provider 
22
providing medical care pursuant to the workers’

permitted but not required to accept the position.

See 825.220(d). As a result, the employee may no

pensation benefit plan, but the employee is entitled 
5
to continue on unpaid FMLA leave either until the 
6
employee is able to return to the same or equivalent 
7
job the employee left or until the 12-week FMLA 
8
leave entitlement is exhausted. See 825.207(e). If 
9
the employee returning from the workers’ compensa-

tion injury is a qualified individual with a disability, 
11
he or she will have rights under the ADA, as made 
12
applicable by the CAA.

‘‘(e) If an employing office requires certifications of 
14
an employee’s fitness for duty to return to work, as per-

1
‘‘(a) To qualify as an exempt executive under 
2
§541.100, the employee must customarily and regularly 
3
direct the work of two or more other employees. The 
4
phrase ‘two or more other employees’ means two full-time 
5
employees or their equivalent. One full-time and two half- 
6
time employees, for example, are equivalent to two full- 
7
time employees. Four half-time employees are also equiva-

lent.

‘‘(b) The supervision can be distributed among two, 
10
three or more employees, but each such employee must 
11
customarily and regularly direct the work of two or more 
12
other full-time employees or the equivalent. Thus, for ex-
13
ample, a department with five full-time nonexempt work-
14
ers may have up to two exempt supervisors if each such 
15
supervisor customarily and regularly directs the work of 
16

‘‘(c) An employee who merely assists the manager of 
18
a particular department and supervises two or more em-
19
ployees only in the actual manager’s absence does not 
20
meet this requirement. 
21
‘‘(d) Hours worked by an employee cannot be credited 
22
more than once for different executives. Thus, a shared 
23
responsibility for the supervision of the same two employ-
24
ees in the same department does not satisfy this require-

ment. However, a full-time employee who works four hours

‘‘To determine whether an employee’s suggestions

and recommendations are given ‘particular weight,’ factors 
6
to be considered include, but are not limited to, whether 
7
it is part of the employee’s job duties to make such sugges-
8
tions and recommendations; the frequency with which 
9
such suggestions and recommendations are made or re-
10
quested; and the frequency with which the employee’s sug-
11
gestions and recommendations are relied upon. Generally, 
12
an executive’s suggestions and recommendations must 
13
pertain to employees whom the executive customarily and 
14
regularly directs. It does not include an occasional sugges-
15
tion with regard to the change in status of a co-worker. 
16
An employee’s suggestions and recommendations may still 
17
be deemed to have ‘particular weight’ even if a higher level

erwise met. Whether an employee meets the requirements 
1
of §541.100 when the employee performs concurrent du-
2
ties is determined on a case-by-case basis and based on 
3
the factors set forth in §541.700. Generally, exempt ex-
4
ecutives make the decision regarding when to perform 
5
nonexempt duties and remain responsible for the success 
6
or failure of business operations under their management 
7
while performing the nonexempt work. In contrast, the 
8
nonexempt employee generally is directed by a supervisor 
9
to perform the exempt work or performs the exempt work 
10
for defined time periods. An employee whose primary duty 
11
is ordinary production work or routine, recurrent or repet-
12
itive tasks cannot qualify for exemption as an executive. 
13
‘‘(b) For example, an assistant manager in a retail 
14
establishment may perform work such as serving cus-
15
tomers, cooking food, stocking shelves and cleaning the es-
16
tablishment, but performance of such nonexempt work 
17
does not preclude the exemption if the assistant manager’s 
18
primary duty is management. An assistant manager can 
19
supervise employees and serve customers at the same time

21
also simultaneously direct the work of other employees and

the employee acquires sufficient knowledge so that ref-

10
of work requiring invention, imagination, originality or tal-
11
ent in a recognized field of artistic or creative endeavor 
12
as opposed to routine mental, manual, mechanical or phys-
13

14
can be produced by a person with general manual or intel-

as music, writing, acting and the graphic arts.

‘‘(c) The requirement of ‘invention, imagination, orig-
21
inality or talent’ distinguishes the creative professions 
22
from work that primarily depends on intelligence, diligence 
23
and accuracy. The duties of employees vary widely, and 
24
exemption as a creative professional depends on the extent

of the invention, imagination, originality or talent exer-
1
cised by the employee. Determination of exempt creative 
2
professional status, therefore, must be made on a case- 
3
by-case basis. This requirement generally is met by actors, 
4
musicians, composers, conductors, and soloists; painters 
5
who at most are given the subject matter of their painting; 
6
cartoonists who are merely told the title or underlying con-
7
cept of a cartoon and must rely on their own creative abil-
8
ity to express the concept; essayists, novelists, short-story 
9
writers and screen-play writers who choose their own sub-
10
jects and hand in a finished piece of work to their employ-
11
ers (the majority of such persons are, of course, not em-
12
ployees but self-employed); and persons holding the more 
13
responsible writing positions in advertising agencies. This 
14
requirement generally is not met by a person who is em-
15
ployed as a copyist, as an ‘animator’ of motion-picture car-
16
toons, or as a retoucher of photographs, since such work 
17

10
ployee who makes sales at the customer’s place of business

12
sales does not include sales made by mail, telephone or

the Internet unless such contact is used merely as an ad-
14
junct to personal calls. Thus, any fixed site, whether home

cumstances under which it is performed. Promotional

12
work that is incidental to sales made, or to be made, by

someone else is not exempt outside sales work. An em-

sales that will be made by someone else are not exempt

shelves, replenishes stock by replacing old with new mer-
6
chandise, sets up displays and consults with the store 
7
manager when inventory runs low, but does not obtain a

commitment for additional purchases. The arrangement of 
9
merchandise on the shelves or the replenishing of stock 
10
is not exempt work unless it is incidental to and in con-
11
junction with the employee’s own outside sales. Because

the employee in this instance does not consummate the

the work is not exempt outside sales work.¿

‘‘(1) Deductions from pay may be made when 
12
an exempt employee is absent from work for one or

more full days for personal reasons, other than sick-
14
ness or disability. Thus, if an employee is absent for

two full days to handle personal affairs, the employ-

2
disability. The employer is not required to pay any 
3
portion of the employee’s salary for full-day absences 
4
for which the employee receives compensation under 
5
the plan, policy or practice. Deductions for such full- 
6
day absences also may be made before the employee 
7
has qualified under the plan, policy or practice, and 
8
after the employee has exhausted the leave allowance 
9
thereunder. Thus, for example, if an employer main-
10
tains a short-term disability insurance plan pro-
11
viding salary replacement for 12 weeks starting on 
12
the fourth day of absence, the employer may make 
13
deductions from pay for the three days of absence 
14
before the employee qualifies for benefits under the 
15
plan; for the twelve weeks in which the employee re-
16
ceives salary replacement benefits under the plan; 
17
and for absences after the employee has exhausted 
18
the 12 weeks of salary replacement benefits. øSimi-
19
larly, an employer may make deductions from pay 
20
for absences of one or more full days if salary re-
21
placement benefits are provided under a State dis-
22
ability insurance law or under a State workers’ com-
23

3
temporary military leave, the employer can offset 
4
any amounts received by an employee as jury fees, 
5
witness fees or military pay for a particular week 
6
against the salary due for that particular week with-
7
out loss of the exemption. 
8
‘‘(4) Deductions from pay of exempt employees 
9
may be made for penalties imposed in good faith for 
10
infractions of safety rules of major significance. 
11
Safety rules of major significance include those re-
12
lating to the prevention of serious danger in the

14
hibiting smoking in explosive plants, oil refineries

one or more full days imposed in good faith for in-
19
fractions of workplace conduct rules. Such suspen-
20
sions must be imposed pursuant to a written policy 
21
applicable to all employees. Thus, for example, an 
22
employer may suspend an exempt employee without 
23
pay for three days for violating a generally applica-

place violence.

‘‘(6) An employer is not required to pay the full 
5
salary in the initial or terminal week of employment. 
6
Rather, an employer may pay a proportionate part 
7
of an employee’s full salary for the time actually 
8
worked in the first and last week of employment. In 
9
such weeks, the payment of an hourly or daily equiv-
10
alent of the employee’s full salary for the time actu-
11
ally worked will meet the requirement. However, em-
12
ployees are not paid on a salary basis within the 
13
meaning of these regulations if they are employed 
14
occasionally for a few days, and the employer pays 
15
them a proportionate part of the weekly salary when 
16
so employed. 
17
‘‘(7) An employer is not required to pay the full 
18
salary for weeks in which an exempt employee takes 
19
unpaid leave under the Family and Medical Leave 
20
Act. Rather, when an exempt employee takes unpaid 
21
leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act, an 
22
employer may pay a proportionate part of the full 
23
salary for time actually worked. For example, if an

employee who normally works 40 hours per week

uses four hours of unpaid leave under the Family 
1
and Medical Leave Act, the employer could deduct 
2
10 percent of the employee’s normal salary that 
3
week. 
4
‘‘(c) When calculating the amount of a deduction 
5
from pay allowed under paragraph (b) of this section, the 
6
employer may use the hourly or daily equivalent of the 
7
employee’s full weekly salary or any other amount propor-
8
tional to the time actually missed by the employee. A de-
9
duction from pay as a penalty for violations of major safe-

ty rules under paragraph (b)(4) of this section may be 
11
made in any amount.

‘‘§ 541.603 Effect of improper deductions from salary

‘‘(a) An employer who makes improper deductions 
14
from salary shall lose the exemption if the facts dem-
15
onstrate that the employer did not intend to pay employees 
16
on a salary basis. An actual practice of making improper

deductions demonstrates that the employer did not intend 
18
to pay employees on a salary basis. The factors to consider 
19
when determining whether an employer has an actual

practice of making improper deductions include, but are 
21
not limited to: the number of improper deductions, par-

icy permitting or prohibiting improper deductions.

‘‘(b) If the facts demonstrate that the employer has

an actual practice of making improper deductions, the ex-

emption is lost during the time period in which the im-
8
proper deductions were made for employees in the same 
9
job classification working for the same managers respon-
10
sible for the actual improper deductions. Employees in dif-
11
ferent job classifications or who work for different man-

agers do not lose their status as exempt employees. Thus, 
13
for example, if a manager øat a company facility¿ rou-

tinely docks the pay of engineers at that facility for par-

tial-day personal absences, then all engineers at that facil-

manager would lose the exemption; engineers at other fa-
18
cilities or working for other managers, however, would re-
19
main exempt. 
20
‘‘(c) Improper deductions that are either isolated or 
21
inadvertent will not result in loss of the exemption for any

such employer will not lose the exemption for any employ-

1
shifts worked, and a reasonable relationship exists between 
2
the guaranteed amount and the amount actually earned. 
3
The reasonable relationship test will be met if the weekly 
4
guarantee is roughly equivalent to the employee’s usual 
5
earnings at the assigned hourly, daily or shift rate for the 
6
employee’s normal scheduled workweek. Thus, for exam-
7
ple, an exempt employee guaranteed compensation of at 
8
least $725 for any week in which the employee performs 
9
any work, and who normally works four or five shifts each 
10
week, may be paid $210 per shift without violating the 
11
$684-per-week salary basis requirement. The reasonable 
12
relationship requirement applies only if the employee’s pay 
13
is computed on an hourly, daily or shift basis. It does not 
14
apply, for example, to an exempt store manager paid a 
15
guaranteed salary per week that exceeds the current salary 
16
level who also receives a commission of one-half percent 
17
of all sales in the store or five percent of the store’s prof-
18
its, which in some weeks may total as much as, or even 
19
more than, the guaranteed salary.

‘‘(a) Administrative and professional employees may

within the meaning of these regulations if the employee

•HRES 1516 IH 
is paid an agreed sum for a single job regardless of the 
1
time required for its completion. These payments resemble 
2
piecework payments with the important distinction that 
3
generally a ‘fee’ is paid for the kind of job that is unique 
4
rather than for a series of jobs repeated an indefinite num-
5
ber of times and for which payment on an identical basis 
6
is made over and over again. Payments based on the num-
7
ber of hours or days worked and not on the accomplish-
8
ment of a given single task are not considered payments 
9
on a fee basis. 
10
‘‘(b) To determine whether the fee payment meets the 
11
minimum amount of salary required for exemption under 
12
these regulations, the amount paid to the employee will 
13
be tested by determining the time worked on the job and 
14
whether the fee payment is at a rate that would amount 
15
to at least the minimum salary per week, as required by 
16
§541.600(a) and 541.602(a), if the employee worked 40 
17
hours. Thus, an artist paid $350 for a picture that took 
18
20 hours to complete meets the $684 minimum salary re-
19
quirement for exemption since earnings at this rate would 
20
yield the artist $700 if 40 hours were worked.

‘‘§ 541.606 Board, lodging or other facilities

1
or other facilities’ means ‘free and clear’ or independent 
2
of any claimed credit for non-cash items of value that an 
3
employer may provide to an employee. Thus, the costs in-
4
curred by an employer to provide an employee with board, 
5
lodging or other facilities may not count towards the min-
6
imum salary amount required for exemption under this 
7
part 541. Such separate transactions are not prohibited 
8

‘‘§ 541.700 Primary duty 
5
‘‘(a) To qualify for exemption under this part, an em-
6
ployee’s ‘primary duty’ must be the performance of exempt 
7
work. The term ‘primary duty’ means the principal, main, 
8
major or most important duty that the employee performs. 
9
Determination of an employee’s primary duty must be 
10
based on all the facts in a particular case, with the major 
11
emphasis on the character of the employee’s job as a 
12
whole. Factors to consider when determining the primary 
13
duty of an employee include, but are not limited to, the 
14
relative importance of the exempt duties as compared with 
15
other types of duties; the amount of time spent performing 
16
exempt work; the employee’s relative freedom from direct 
17
supervision; and the relationship between the employee’s 
18
salary and the wages paid to other employees for the kind 
19
of nonexempt work performed by the employee. 
20
‘‘(b) The amount of time spent performing exempt 
21
work can be a useful guide in determining whether exempt 
22
work is the primary duty of an employee. Thus, employees 
23
who spend more than 50 percent of their time performing 
24
exempt work will generally satisfy the primary duty re-
25
quirement. Time alone, however, is not the sole test, and 
26
02:41 Dec 13, 2022
HR1516
317 
•HRES 1516 IH 
nothing in this section requires that exempt employees 
1
spend more than 50 percent of their time performing ex-
2
empt work. Employees who do not spend more than 50 
3
percent of their time performing exempt duties may none-
4
theless meet the primary duty requirement if the other 
5
factors support such a conclusion. 
6
‘‘(c) Thus, for example, assistant managers in a retail 
7
establishment who perform exempt executive work such as 
8
supervising and directing the work of other employees, or-
9
dering merchandise, managing the budget and authorizing 
10
payment of bills may have management as their primary 
11
duty even if the assistant managers spend more than 50 
12
percent of the time performing nonexempt work such as 
13
running the cash register. However, if such assistant man-
14
agers are closely supervised and earn little more than the 
15
nonexempt employees, the assistant managers generally 
16
would not satisfy the primary duty requirement. 
17
‘‘§ 541.701 Customarily and regularly 
18
‘‘The phrase ‘customarily and regularly’ means a fre-
19
quency that must be greater than occasional but which, 
20
of course, may be less than constant. Tasks or work per-
21
formed ‘customarily and regularly’ includes work normally 
22

23

3
541.302, 541.303, 541.304, <<and>> 541.400 øand

5
to such work. All other work is considered ‘nonexempt.’ 
6
‘‘§ 541.703 Directly and closely related 
7
‘‘(a) Work that is ‘directly and closely related’ to the 
8
performance of exempt work is also considered exempt 
9
work. The phrase ‘directly and closely related’ means 
10
tasks that are related to exempt duties and that contribute 
11
to or facilitate performance of exempt work. Thus, ‘di-
12
rectly and closely related’ work may include physical tasks 
13
and menial tasks that arise out of exempt duties, and the 
14
routine work without which the exempt employee’s exempt 
15
work cannot be performed properly. Work ‘directly and 
16
closely related’ to the performance of exempt duties may 
17
also include recordkeeping; monitoring and adjusting ma-
18
chinery; taking notes; using the computer to create docu-
19
ments or presentations; opening the mail for the purpose 
20
of reading it and making decisions; and using a photo-

‘‘(b) The following examples further illustrate the 
1
type of work that is and is not normally considered as

directly and closely related to exempt work: 
3
‘‘(1) Keeping time, production or sales records

‘‘(3) A supervisor who spot checks and exam-
12

13

formed by a nonexempt inspector. 
19
‘‘(4) A supervisor who sets up a machine may 
20
be engaged in exempt work, depending upon the na-
21
ture of the industry and the operation. In some 
22
cases the setup work, or adjustment of the machine 
23
for a particular job, is typically performed by the

•HRES 1516 IH 
setup work is part of the production operation and 
1
is not exempt. In other cases, the setting up of the 
2
work is a highly skilled operation which the ordinary 
3
production worker or machine tender typically does 
4
not perform. In large plants, non-supervisors may 
5
perform such work. However, particularly in small 
6
plants, such work may be a regular duty of the exec-
7
utive and is directly and closely related to the execu-
8
tive’s responsibility for the work performance of sub-
9
ordinates and for the adequacy of the final product. 
10
Under such circumstances, it is exempt work. 
11
‘‘(5) A department manager in a retail or serv-
12
ice establishment who walks about the sales floor ob-
13

However, because this work is necessary for ana-

lyzing the data and making recommendations, the 
5
work is directly and closely related to exempt work. 
6
While it is possible to assign note-taking and typing

to nonexempt employees, and in fact it is frequently
