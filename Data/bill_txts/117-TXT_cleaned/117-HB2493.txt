•HR 2493 IH
(1) allow for the enforcement of State laws re-
1
quiring the disclosure of information about Holo-
2
caust-era insurance policies, notwithstanding the 
3
holding of the Supreme Court of the United States 
4
in American Insurance Association v. Garamendi, 
5
539 U.S. 396 (2003) that such laws are preempted 
6
by the foreign policy espoused by the executive 
7
branch of the Federal Government addressed in that 
8
case; 
9
(2) facilitate the disclosure of information about 
10
Holocaust-era insurance policies under applicable 
11
State laws so that citizens of the United States (and 
12
other persons on whose behalf such laws were en-
13
acted) may know whether they hold any rights under 
14
the policies; 
15
(3) create a new Federal private cause of action 
16
and subject matter jurisdiction to allow the bene-
17
ficiaries of Holocaust-era insurance policies, many of 
18
whom are citizens of the United States, to bring 
19
suits in the courts of the United States to recover 
20
any proceeds under the policies to which they may 
21
be entitled, notwithstanding the defense that such 
22
suits are preempted by the executive branch foreign 
23
policy addressed in Garamendi, with the State law of 
24
the forum or Federal common law providing the rule

of decision governing the right of a beneficiary to re-
1
cover under such policies; 
2
(4) foreclose defenses to claims brought under 
3
section 4 of this Act arising from any prior judg-
4
ments or settlement agreements (including the class 
5
action judgment and settlement agreement (M21– 
6
89, United States District Court for the Southern 
7
District of New York) in In re: Assicurazioni Gen-
8
eral S.p.A. Holocaust Insurance Litigation) that 
9
were entered and approved based on the erroneous 
10
conclusion that State law claims to recover under 
11
Holocaust-era insurance claims are preempted by 
12
the executive branch foreign policy addressed in 
13
Garamendi; 
14
(5) provide for a uniform statute of limitations 
15
of 10 years after the date of enactment of this Act 
16
in any action to recover under Holocaust-era insur-
17
ance policies under this Act or State law; and 
18
(6) in carrying out the purposes described in 
19
paragraphs (1) through (5), preserve the lawmaking 
20
powers of Congress under article I of the Constitu-
21
tion of the United States, with which the judicial de-
22
cisions cited in this section are inconsistent.
