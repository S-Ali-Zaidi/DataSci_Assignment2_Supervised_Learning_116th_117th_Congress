in the settling and founding of America, the economic 
and political environments that led to the development, 
institutionalization, and abolition of slavery and its im-
pact on all Americans, the exploration and expansion 
of America, impact on and contributions to the develop-
ment and enhancement of American life, United States

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Black History is Amer-
4
ican History Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Whereas since before its founding, the 
8
United States of America has benefited from and 
9
been enhanced by the integral role African Ameri-
10
cans have played in our country’s history and con-
11
tributions to the world. 
12
(2) Whereas African American history does not 
13
begin in the Americas. It can be traced back to the 
14
great empires of West Africa beginning in A.D. 790, 
15
which aided the establishment and survival of colo-
16
nies in America and the New World, generally, and 
17
fought against European oppression.

•HR 1394 IH
(3) Whereas African Americans have rep-
1
resented a significant portion of the American popu-
2
lation from nearly 20 percent at the signing of the 
3
Declaration of Independence, almost all of whom, if 
4
not all, were victims of the largest forced deporta-
5
tions in recorded history, the transatlantic slave 
6
trade and resulting African diaspora. It is estimated 
7
over 10,000,000 free Africans were enslaved between 
8
the mid-fifteenth and nineteenth centuries during 
9
the diaspora. 
10
(4) Whereas slavery was not abolished and Afri-
11
can Americans not acknowledged as American citi-
12
zens until the mid-nineteenth century, servitude did 
13
not abate their contributions to the settlement, 
14
growth, and development of the United States, 
15
which continued through Post-Reconstruction, Jim 
16
Crow, industrialization, World Wars and conflicts, 
17
innovation 
and 
inventiveness, 
constitutional 
18
progress, and every aspect of American society. 
19
(5) Whereas during the civil rights movement of 
20
the 1950s and 1960s, civil rights leaders and activ-
21
ists championed the fight for equal rights, including 
22
voting rights, for all African Americans. 
23
(6) Whereas the seminal case of Brown v. 
24
Board of Education, decided May 17, 1954, found 
25
15:46 Mar 24, 2021
H1394

•HR 1394 IH
that the decades old policy of separate but equal ac-
1
cess to education was inherently unequal, and the 
2
segregation of Black public-school students was no 
3
longer the law of the land. 
4
(7) Whereas African Americans continue to 
5
fight discrimination, structural racism, economic in-
6
equities, and benign and overt omission of the inte-
7
gral role they played in our country’s rise to great-
8
ness. 
9
(8) Whereas currently, 12 States (Arkansas, 
10
California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, 
11
New York, Michigan, Mississippi, Rhode Island, 
12
South Carolina, and Texas) have passed educational 
13
laws requiring Black history be incorporated into the 
14
curricula of all public schools. 
15
(9) Whereas Congress established the National 
16
Museum of African American History and Culture 
17
in 2003 after decades of efforts to promote and 
18
highlight the contributions of African Americans, 
19
which serves as an indication of the national impor-
20
tance of examining Black history. Since opening in 
21
2016, the museum has worked to educate the public 
22
on the American story through the lens of African 
23
American history and culture and provide educators, 
24
parents, caregivers, and students with tools and re-
25

•HR 1394 IH
sources on the African American experience, its na-
1
tional impact, race, racism, and the importance of 
2
tolerance and inclusivity. 
3
(10) Whereas according to a 2015 research 
4
study conducted by the National Museum of African 
5
American History and Culture and reported in Re-
6
search into the State of African American History 
7
and Culture in K–12 Public Schools, key findings in-
8
dicated that teachers considered Black history as in-
9
fluential in understanding the complexity of United 
10
States history. 
11
(11) Whereas the importance of Black history 
12
is reflected in the National Assessment of Edu-
13
cational Progress United States History framework, 
14
from pre-colonization through contemporary Amer-
15
ica. 
16
(12) Whereas the Federal Government, through 
17
support for educational activities of national muse-
18
ums established under Federal law, can assist teach-
19
ers in efforts to incorporate historically accurate in-
20
struction on the comprehensive history of African 
21
Americans and students in their exploration of Black 
22
history as an integral part of American history.
