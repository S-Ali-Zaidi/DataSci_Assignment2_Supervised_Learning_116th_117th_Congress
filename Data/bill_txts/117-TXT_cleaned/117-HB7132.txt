Act, have the meanings given those terms in such section 
1

2
SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
3
Congress finds the following: 
4
(1) Domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, 
5
sexual assault, human trafficking, and related 
6
crimes are life-threatening issues and have lasting 
7
and harmful effects on individuals, families, and en-
8
tire communities. 
9
(2) Survivors often lack meaningful support 
10
and options when establishing independence from an 
11
abuser, including barriers such as financial insecu-
12
rity and limited access to reliable communications 
13
tools to maintain essential connections with family, 
14
social safety networks, employers, and support serv-
15
ices. 
16
(3) Perpetrators of violence and abuse described 
17
in paragraph (1) increasingly use technological and 
18
communications tools to exercise control over, mon-
19
itor, and abuse their victims. 
20
(4) Communications law can play a public in-
21
terest role in the promotion of safety, life, and prop-
22
erty with respect to the types of violence and abuse 
23
described in paragraph (1). For example, inde-
24

•HR 7132 IH
pendent access to a wireless phone plan can assist 
1
survivors in establishing security and autonomy. 
2
(5) Safeguards within communications services 
3
can serve a role in preventing abuse and narrowing 
4
the digital divide experienced by survivors of abuse.
