SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
The Congress makes the following findings: 
2
(1) 35 million people, including over 10 million 
3
children, suffered from hunger even before the 
4
COVID-19 pandemic. 
5
(2) Analyses show that 50 million people, in-
6
cluding 17 million children, could go hungry due to 
7
the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
8
(3) As of December 2020, food insecurity 
9
among White households with children was 24.2 per-
10
cent, while 38.6 percent of Latinx and 40.6 percent 
11
of African-American households with children suf-
12
fered from food insecurity. 
13
(4) Black and Hispanic children were twice as 
14
likely to live in households without enough to eat as 
15
White children, entering this crisis at dispropor-
16
tionate risk of going hungry. 
17
(5) Adults who identify as American Indian, 
18
Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, or 
19
as multiracial, were twice as likely as White adults 
20
to report that their household did not get enough to 
21
eat. While official national data for Native American 
22
households is lacking, previous research in Wash-
23
ington State showed food insecurity among Native 
24
households was 2.5 times higher than in White 
25
households.

(6) The COVID-19 pandemic has deepened 
1
longstanding racial disparities and food insecurity. 
2
(7) SNAP is the Nation’s first line of defense 
3
against hunger and is especially vital for vulnerable 
4
populations. More than 85 percent of all SNAP ben-
5
efits go to households with children, seniors, and 
6
persons with disabilities. 
7
(8) SNAP helps restore access to healthy food, 
8
improves overall health, and reduces poverty. SNAP 
9
participation is also associated with educational ad-
10
vancement of children in poverty and improvements 
11
in math and reading scores. 
12
(9) SNAP has a proven record of effectiveness 
13
in promoting food security and health as well as in 
14
providing economic stimulus. Each $1 in SNAP ben-
15
efits during a downturn generates between $1.50 
16
and $1.80 in economic activity. 
17
(10) Studies have also demonstrated that work 
18
requirements do not reduce poverty. 
19
(11) About 6.1 million individuals are subject to 
20
SNAP work requirements and are at risk of losing 
21
critical food assistance if they cannot comply. 
22
(12) Some live in households with school-aged 
23
children where benefit reductions or terminations

could jeopardize children’s health, development, and 
1
future success. 
2
(13) Children in poverty also often depend on 
3
pooled resources (including SNAP benefits) from ex-
4
tended family members who do not claim them as 
5
dependents. 
6
(14) Studies show that health impediments are 
7
a primary cause of why many SNAP recipients are 
8
unable to meet a work requirement. 
9
(15) Work requirements also cause an increase 
10
in the administrative bureaucracy, which some stud-
11
ies have shown, cause a significant reduction in 
12
SNAP participation. 
13
(16) Studies show that Black Americans are 
14
particularly vulnerable and are most likely to face 
15
recent unemployment and work requirements would 
16
disproportionately prevent Black people from having 
17
access to this important benefit. 
18
(17) Families experiencing homelessness are 
19
most likely to leave programs like SNAP when there 
20
is a work requirement, thereby increasing their vul-
21
nerability. 
22
(18) COVID-19 has made people more vulner-
23
able. A work requirement would serve to only further
