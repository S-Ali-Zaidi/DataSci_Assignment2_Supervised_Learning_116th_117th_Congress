A BILL 
To authorize the Secretary of the Interior, through the 
Coastal Program of the United States Fish and Wildlife 
Service, to work with willing partners and provide sup-
port to efforts to assess, protect, restore, and enhance 
important coastal areas that provide fish and wildlife 
habitat on which Federal trust species depend, and for 
other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. 
1
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that— 
2
(1) an effective means of conserving and recov-
3
ering Federal trust species and promoting self-sus-
4
taining populations of those species is to protect, 
5
conserve, restore, and enhance the habitats of the 
6
species; 
7
(2) coastal ecosystems are highly dynamic areas 
8
that provide valuable breeding, nursery, staging, and 
9
resting areas for a rich diversity of fish, shellfish, 
10
migratory birds, and mammals; 
11
(3) coastal areas support— 
12
(A) 40 percent of the refuges within the 
13
National Wildlife Refuge System; 
14
(B) 40 percent of the threatened species or 
15
endangered species, including 75 percent of the 
16
listed mammals and birds, under the Endan-
17
gered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et 
18
seq.); and 
19
(C) 50 percent of the fisheries conservation 
20
activities of the Service; 
21
(4) although coastal counties make up only 10 
22
percent of total contiguous United States land area, 
23
coastal areas are home to more than 40 percent of 
24
the human population of the United States, which is 
25
placing enormous pressure on coastal ecosystems; 
26

•HR 4092 IH
(5) because coastal deterioration can cause 
1
fragmentation and landward migration of coastal 
2
ecosystems, as well as create new habitats along 
3
shorelines, it has become necessary to incorporate 
4
adaptation assistance into coastal ecosystem man-
5
agement strategies; 
6
(6) in addition to serving as fish and wildlife 
7
habitat, coastal ecosystems— 
8
(A) serve as an important source of food; 
9
(B) protect coastal communities, including 
10
infrastructure in those communities, against 
11
floods; 
12
(C) filter polluted runoff; and 
13
(D) provide valuable commercial and rec-
14
reational benefits to coastal communities and 
15
the United States; 
16
(7)(A) fish and wildlife conservation is a re-
17
sponsibility shared by citizens and government; and 
18
(B) public-private partnerships should be sup-
19
ported through technical assistance and financial as-
20
sistance to conduct coastal habitat assessment, pro-
21
tection, planning, restoration, and enhancement 
22
projects in coastal ecosystems; 
23

24
creasingly relies on interdependent partnerships in

which priority setting, planning, and conservation

delivery are collaborative endeavors; 
2
(9) since 1985, the Service has administered 
3
the Coastal Program through which the Service 
4
works with willing partners to assess, protect, plan, 
5
restore, and enhance coastal ecosystems, including 
6
coastal wetlands and watersheds, uplands, and ripar-
7
ian and in-stream habitats, that provide significant 
8
benefits to Federal trust species; 
9
(10) through the Coastal Program, the Service 
10
provides strategic conservation planning and design 
11
at the regional and landscape scales, and integrates 
12
the resources of the Service to address priorities 
13
identified by partners; and 
14
(11) the Coastal Program of the Service com-
15
plements and enhances the National Coastal Wet-
16
lands Conservation Grant Program under section 
17
305 of the Coastal Wetlands Planning, Protection 
18
and Restoration Act (16 U.S.C. 3954), which pro-
19
vides matching grants to coastal States to support 
20
long-term conservation of coastal wetlands and asso-
21
ciated habitats. 
22
(b) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act is to legisla-
23
tively authorize the Coastal Program of the Service in ef-
24
fect as of the date of enactment of this Act to conduct
