Whereas the Caribbean region has a population of approxi-
mately 44,000,000 people, millions of people have emi-
grated between the Caribbean and the United States, and 
approximately 13,000,000 people in the United States, or 
4 percent of the United States population, share Carib-
bean ancestry; 
Whereas it is in the national interest of the United States to 
support the economic development of sovereign Caribbean 
nations and territories; 
Whereas greater opportunities for mutually beneficial trade 
and investments promote economic growth, development, 
poverty reduction, democracy, the rule of law, civil rights, 
and overall stability; 
Whereas regional and global integration with our Caribbean 
neighbors should be strengthened to create decent jobs, 
boost economic growth in the Caribbean and the United 
States, and eliminate barriers to trade and investment in 
the Caribbean; 
Whereas it remains the goal of the United States to support 
diversification of Caribbean exports to the United States; 
Whereas, in 1983, Congress launched the Caribbean Basin 
Initiative (CBI) through the Caribbean Basin Economic 
Recovery Act (CBERA) and expanded it in 2000 with the 
United States–Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act 
(CBTPA); 
Whereas the United States shares a history of struggle with 
Caribbean neighbor countries, including with our coura-
geous sister nation of Haiti; 
Whereas Haiti suffered destabilizing events in 2021, includ-
ing severe insecurity, a deadly earthquake, widespread 
democratic protests, continuation of the COVID–19 pan-

demic, and the assassination of President Jovenel Moı¨se, 
all of which have contributed to a governance and hu-
manitarian crisis that requires immediate further atten-
tion and support from the United States and the global 
community; 
Whereas specialized United States trade preferences with 
Haiti, including the Haiti Economic Lift Program 
(HELP) and Hemispheric Opportunity through Partner-
ship Encouragement Act (HOPE II) programs, aid Hai-
ti’s growing textile and apparel manufacturing industry 
and are a critical source of steady jobs for many Haitian 
people to support their families; 
Whereas trade preference programs for the Caribbean and 
Caribbean Community (CARICOM) countries, such as 
the Generalized System of Preferences, CBI, and CBTPA 
have provided important economic benefits for Caribbean 
Basin country economies, including by facilitating niche 
production and more diversified exports, while also bene-
fitting United States businesses and workers, including 
by helping to add value for customers and supporting 
United States jobs; 
Whereas Caribbean people and their island nation economies 
have led globally by exploring innovative economic strate-
gies to produce collective benefits for their communities, 
such as through the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insur-
ance Facility, to reduce the economic impact of major 
disasters; 
Whereas the United States seeks to prioritize and promote a 
worker-centered trade agenda that facilitates trade and 
protects freedom of association, fosters a sustainable en-
vironment and climate path, advances racial equity and 
supports underserved communities, addresses unfair eco-

nomic trade practices, supports domestic producers, and 
promotes growth and development around the world; 
Whereas the COVID–19 pandemic has negatively impacted 
the public health and economies of the Caribbean and the 
United States, which has also contributed to inequality 
within and between nations, and further excluded vulner-
able groups from the benefits of trade and economic de-
velopment; 
Whereas the COVID–19 pandemic has highlighted the need 
to strengthen supply chain resilience and increase near- 
shoring in global trade; 
Whereas the United States believes that free and fair trade 
practices, economic growth, and stable domestic employ-
ment foster democratic principles of good governance; 
Whereas United States and Caribbean economic ties, includ-
ing through Caribbean services and manufacturing sec-
tors, produce critical goods and services for consumers 
and jobs for workers that strengthen their economies; 
Whereas such economic ties serve strategic purposes by pro-
viding an alternative to potentially predatory economic 
practices of other foreign governments, including non- 
market economies, in the Caribbean that harm national 
and regional interests in the Western Hemisphere; 
Whereas climate change and natural disasters pose acute 
risks for Caribbean people and island economies; and 
Whereas the United States signed a Trade and Investment 
Framework Agreement in 2013 with CARICOM to drive

and
