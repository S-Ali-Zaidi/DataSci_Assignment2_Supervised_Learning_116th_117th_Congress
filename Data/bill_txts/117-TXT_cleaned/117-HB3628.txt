with vehicles, objects, pedestrians, bicyclists, and 
20
other vulnerable road users while the vehicle is trav-
21
eling forward, provides a warning to the driver, and 
22
automatically applies the brakes to avoid or mitigate

‘‘(5) blind spot warning that detects a vehicle, 
13
pedestrian, bicyclist, and other vulnerable road user 
14
to the side or rear of a vehicle and alerts the driver

‘‘(c) CONSIDERATIONS.—In prescribing the motor ve-
19
hicle safety standards required in subsection (a), the Sec-
20
retary shall require that the crash avoidance systems—
