SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
1
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Since at least 2016, United States Govern-
3
ment personnel and their family members have re-
4
ported anomalous health incidents at diplomatic mis-
5
sions across the world and in the United States, 
6
which are sometimes referred to as ‘‘Havana Syn-
7
drome’’. 
8
(2) Some of the anomalous health incidents 
9
have resulted in unexplained brain injuries, which 
10
have had permanent, life-altering effects that have 
11
disrupted lives and ended careers. 
12
(3) A panel of experts convened by the Bureau 
13
of Medical Services of the Department of State in 
14
July 2017 to review triage assessments of medically 
15
evaluated personnel from the United States Em-
16
bassy in Havana came to a consensus that the find-
17
ings were most likely related to neurotrauma from a 
18
nonnatural source. 
19
(4) A 2020 report by the National Academy of 
20
Sciences found that ‘‘many of the distinctive and 
21
acute signs, symptoms, and observations reported by 
22
[affected] employees are consistent with the effects 
23
of directed, pulsed radio frequency (RF) energy’’ 
24
and that ‘‘directed pulsed RF energy [...] appears to 
25
20:10 Sep 16, 2021
H5263
3 
•HR 5263 IH
be the most plausible mechanism in explaining these 
1
cases’’. 
2
(5) According to the National Academy of 
3
Sciences report, ‘‘such a scenario raises grave con-
4
cerns about a world with disinhibited malevolent ac-
5
tors and new tools for causing harm to others’’. 
6
(6) The number and locations of these sus-
7
pected attacks have expanded and, according to 
8
press reporting, there have been more than 130 pos-
9
sible cases that have been reported by United States 
10
personnel in Asia, in Europe, and in the Western 
11
Hemisphere, including within the United States. 
12
(7) The continuing and expanding scope of 
13
these suspected attacks is impacting the security 
14
and morale of United States personnel, especially 
15
those posted overseas. 
16
(8) The Convention on the Prevention and Pun-
17
ishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected 
18
Persons (including diplomatic agents) to which 180 
19
countries are a party, protects diplomatic personnel 
20
from attacks on their persons, accommodations, or 
21
means of transport, and requires all state parties to 
22
punish and take measures to prevent such grave 
23
crimes.

(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
1
gress that— 
2
(1) the threat to United States Government 
3
personnel from suspected attacks presenting as 
4
anomalous health incidents is a matter of urgent 
5
concern and deserving of the full attention of gov-
6
ernment; 
7
(2) personnel, dependents, and other appro-
8
priate individuals suffering anomalous health inci-
9
dents from these suspected attacks deserve equi-
10
table, accessible, and high-quality medical assess-
11
ment and care, regardless of their employing Gov-
12
ernment agency; 
13
(3) diagnoses and determinations to treat per-
14
sonnel, dependents, and other appropriate individ-
15
uals experiencing symptoms consistent with such in-
16
juries should be made by experienced medical profes-
17
sionals and made available by the Federal Govern-
18
ment; 
19
(4) any recriminations, retaliation, or punish-
20
ment associated with personnel self-reporting symp-
21
toms is unacceptable and should be investigated by 
22
internal agency oversight mechanisms; 
23
20:10 Sep 16, 2021
H5263
5 
•HR 5263 IH
(5) information sharing and interagency coordi-
1
nation is essential for the comprehensive investiga-
2
tion, attribution, and mitigation of these injuries; 
3
(6) the Administration should provide Congress 
4
and the public with timely and regular unclassified 
5
updates on the threat posed to United States Gov-
6
ernment personnel by the suspected causes of these 
7
injuries; 
8
(7) recent efforts by the Administration and 
9
among relevant agencies represent positive steps to-
10
ward responding to the threat of anomalous health 
11
incidents, but more comprehensive measures must be 
12
taken to further assist victims, investigate and de-
13
termine the cause of the injuries of such victims, 
14
and prevent future incidents; 
15
(8) establishing the source and cause of these 
16
anomalous health incidents must be a top priority 
17
for the United States Government and requires the 
18
full coordination of relevant agencies; 
19
(9) if investigations determine that the anoma-
20
lous health incidents are the result of deliberate acts 
21
by individuals, entities, or foreign countries, the 
22
United States Government should recognize and re-
23
spond to these incidents as hostile attacks; and 
24
20:10 Sep 16, 2021
H5263

•HR 5263 IH
(10) any actors found to have been targeting 
1
United States Government personnel should be pub-
2
licly identified, as appropriate, and held accountable.

SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
4
It is the policy of the United States— 
5
(1) to detect, deter, and punish any clandestine 
6
attacks that cause persistent injuries to United 
7
States personnel; 
8
(2) to provide appropriate assistance to United 
9
States personnel harmed by such attacks; 
10
(3) to hold responsible any persons, entities, or 
11
governments involved in ordering or carrying out 
12
such attacks, including through appropriate sanc-
13
tions, criminal prosecutions, or other tools; 
14
(4) to prioritize research into effective counter-
15
measures to help protect United States personnel 
16
from such attacks; and 
17
(5) to convey to foreign governments through 
18
official contact at the highest levels the gravity of 
19
United States concern about such suspected attacks 
20
and the seriousness of consequences that may follow 
21
for any actors found to be involved.
