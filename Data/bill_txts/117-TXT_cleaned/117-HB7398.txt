Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Prohibit Wildlife Kill-
4
ing Contests Act of 2022’’.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 7398 IH
(1) Wildlife killing contests are organized 
1
events in which participants kill animals for cash, 
2
prizes, entertainment, or other inducements. Judg-
3
ing categories for wildlife killing contests include, 
4
but are not limited to, the number of animals killed, 
5
the weight or the sex of animals killed, a tiered point 
6
system by species killed, or the smallest or largest 
7
body or body part size of animals killed. 
8
(2) Wildlife killing contests often target eco-
9
logically important carnivores, including foxes, bob-
10
cats, and coyotes. 
11
(3) Scientific evidence does not support claims 
12
that wildlife killing contests permanently reduce pop-
13
ulations of targeted species, increase populations of 
14
deer or other game species, or prevent conflict be-
15
tween native carnivores, humans, pets, and livestock. 
16
(4) Because participants often wastefully dis-
17
card targeted wildlife, wildlife killing contests do not 
18
embody the hunting principles set forth by the 
19
North America Wildlife Conservation Model, which 
20
includes a requirement that wildlife only be killed for 
21
a legitimate purpose. As a result, numerous State 
22
agencies and officials have recognized that these 
23
contests can undermine public support for hunting

and damage the reputation of sportsmen and sports-
1
women who abide by traditional hunting ethics. 
2
(5) As of March 1, 2022, Arizona, California, 
3
New Mexico, Vermont, Massachusetts, Colorado, 
4
Maryland, and Washington have banned wildlife kill-
5
ing contests that target certain species. 
6
(6) Wildlife killing contests held on Federal 
7
lands undermine Federal wildlife management prac-
8
tices, public trust duties, and conservation ethics.
