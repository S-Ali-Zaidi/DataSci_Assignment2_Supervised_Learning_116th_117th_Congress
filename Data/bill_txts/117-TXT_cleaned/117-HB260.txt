SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress makes the following findings: 
7
(1) Women in the United States and around 
8
the world are the linchpin of families and commu-
9
nities and are often the first to feel the immediate 
10
and adverse effects of social, environmental, and eco-
11
nomic stresses on their families and communities. 
12
(2) The United Nations has recognized, as one 
13
of the central organizing principles for its work, that 
14
‘‘no enduring solution to society’s most threatening 
15
social, economic and political problems can be found 
16
without the full participation, and the full empower-
17
ment, of the world’s women’’.

•HR 260 IH
(3) The United Nations Development Pro-
1
gramme 2013 Human Development Report has 
2
found that the number of people living in extreme 
3
poverty could increase by up to 3,000,000,000 by 
4
2050 unless environmental disasters are averted by 
5
coordinated global action. 
6
(4) Climate change is already forcing the most 
7
vulnerable communities and populations in devel-
8
oping countries to face unprecedented climate stress, 
9
including water scarcity and drought, as well as se-
10
vere weather events and floods, which can lead to re-
11
duced agricultural productivity, food insecurity, and 
12
increased disease. 
13
(5) Climate change exacerbates issues of scar-
14
city and lack of accessibility to primary natural re-
15
sources, forest resources, and arable land for food 
16
production, thereby contributing to increased conflict 
17
and instability, as well as the workload and stresses 
18
on women farmers, who are estimated to produce 60 
19
to 80 percent of the food in most developing coun-
20
tries. 
21
(6) Women will disproportionately face harmful 
22
impacts from climate change, particularly in poor 
23
and developing nations where women regularly as-
24
sume increased responsibility for growing the fam-
25

•HR 260 IH
ily’s food and collecting water, fuel, and other re-
1
sources. 
2
(7) Epidemics, such as malaria and zika, are 
3
expected to worsen and spread due to variations in 
4
climate, putting women (especially pregnant mothers 
5
and women who hope to become pregnant) and chil-
6
dren without access to prevention and medical serv-
7
ices at risk. 
8
(8) The direct and indirect effects of climate 
9
change have a disproportionate impact on marginal-
10
ized women, such as environmental refugees and dis-
11
placed persons, migrants, religious, racial, or ethnic 
12
minorities, adolescent girls, lesbian and trans 
13
women, women living in poverty, and women and 
14
girls with disabilities and those who are living with 
15
HIV. 
16
(9) Conflict has a disproportionate impact on 
17
the most vulnerable communities and populations, 
18
including women, and is fueled in the poorest re-
19
gions of the world by harsher climates, leading to 
20
migration, refugee crises, and conflicts over scarce 
21
natural resources, including land and water. 
22
(10) Displaced, refugee, and stateless women 
23
and girls face extreme violence and threats, includ-

(A) being forced to exchange sex for food 
1
and humanitarian supplies; 
2
(B) being at increased risk of rape, sexual 
3
exploitation, and abuse; and 
4
(C) being at increased risk for HIV, sexu-
5
ally transmitted infections (STIs), unplanned 
6
pregnancy, and poor reproductive health. 
7
(11) It is predicted that climate change will 
8
lead to increasing frequency and intensity of extreme 
9
weather conditions, precipitating the occurrence of 
10
natural disasters around the globe. 
11
(12) The relocation and death of women, and 
12
especially mothers, as a result of climate-related dis-
13
asters often has devastating impacts on social sup-
14
port networks, family ties, and the coping capacity 
15
of families and communities. 
16
(13) The ability of women to adapt to climate 
17
change is constrained by a lack of economic free-
18
doms, property and inheritance rights, and access to 
19
financial resources, education, family planning and 
20
reproductive health, and new tools, equipment, and 
21
technology. 
22
(14) Despite having a unique capacity and 
23
knowledge to promote and provide for adaptation to 
24
05:43 Feb 05, 2021
H260
6 
•HR 260 IH
climate change, women often have insufficient re-
1
sources to undertake such adaptation. 
2
(15) Women are shown to have a multiplier ef-
3
fect because women use their income and resources, 
4
when given the necessary tools, to increase the well- 
5
being of their children and families, and thus play 
6
a critical role in reducing food insecurity, poverty, 
7
and socioeconomic effects of climate change. 
8
(16) Women are often underrepresented in the 
9
development and formulation of policy regarding 
10
mitigation and adaptation to climate change, even 
11
though women are often in the best position to pro-
12
vide and consult on adaptive strategies.
