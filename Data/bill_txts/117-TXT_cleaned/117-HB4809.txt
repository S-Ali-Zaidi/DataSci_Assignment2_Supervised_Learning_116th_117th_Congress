SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) There are approximately 400,000 Medicare 
3
beneficiaries with end-stage renal disease, making up 
4
1 percent of the Medicare population but accounting 
5
for approximately 7 percent of all Medicare spend-
6
ing. 
7
(2) Expected remaining lifetime for dialysis pa-
8
tients under 80 years old is one-third as long as 
9
their counterparts without ESRD, and for dialysis 
10
patients over 80 years old, it is one-half as long as 
11
that of their counterparts without ESRD. 
12
(3) On average, hemodialysis patients are hos-
13
pitalized nearly twice per year and about 30 percent 
14
have an unplanned rehospitalization within the 30 
15
days following discharge, contributing to high costs 
16
for treating ESRD Medicare beneficiaries. 
17
(4) There is a lack of innovative new devices for 
18
ESRD Medicare beneficiaries, in part because of the 
19
lack of reimbursement incentives for novel devices.
