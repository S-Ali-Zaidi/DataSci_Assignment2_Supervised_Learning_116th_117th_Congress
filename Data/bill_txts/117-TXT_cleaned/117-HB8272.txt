SEC. 3. EXPANSION OF NATIONAL DEFENSE STOCKPILE RE-
1
QUIREMENTS AND CAPACITY RELATING TO 
2
RARE EARTH ELEMENTS AND COVERED CRIT-
3

4
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that increasing the 
5
storage of substantial quantities of rare earth elements, 
6
covered critical minerals, and rare earth or covered critical 
7
mineral products in the National Defense Stockpile will— 
8
(1) diminish the vulnerability of the United 
9
States to the effects of severe disruptions to the sup-
10
ply chains for such elements, minerals, and prod-
11
ucts; and 
12
(2) provide limited protection from the con-
13
sequences of an interruption in supplies of such ele-
14
ments, minerals, and products, particularly such ele-
15
ments, minerals, and products required to meet the 
16
needs of the Armed Forces and the defense indus-
17
trial and technology sectors. 
18
(b) STATEMENT OF POLICY.—It is the policy of the 
19
United States to expand and maintain a strategic reserve 
20
of rare earth elements, covered critical minerals, and rare 
21
earth or covered critical mineral products. 
22
(c) DECLARATION OF PURPOSES.—Section 2 of the 
23
Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act (50
