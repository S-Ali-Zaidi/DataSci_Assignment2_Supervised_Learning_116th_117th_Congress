SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Prostate cancer is the second leading cause 
3
of cancer death in men in the United States with 1 
4
in 41 men dying from prostate cancer and more 
5
than 31,600 men estimated to die from prostate 
6
cancer in 2019. 
7
(2) Prostate cancer is the second most com-
8
monly diagnosed cancer in the Nation with 1 in 9 
9
men being diagnosed in their lifetimes, 3.1 million 
10
men in the United States living with a diagnosis, 
11
and over 174,000 men estimated to be diagnosed in 
12
2019. 
13
(3) The survival rate for prostate cancer diag-
14
nosed in early stage is near 100 percent but prostate 
15
cancer diagnosed in late stage has only a 30-percent 
16
survival rate. 
17
(4) There are few, if any, symptoms of prostate 
18
cancer before it reaches late stage. 
19
(5) African-American men have a disproportion-
20
ately higher rate of prostate cancer and are 70 per-
21
cent more likely to be diagnosed with prostate can-
22
cer than White men, with 1 in 6 African-American 
23
men developing prostate cancer in their lifetimes. 
24
(6) African-American men are 2.3 times more 
25
likely to die from prostate cancer than White men.

(7) Men with a father or brother with prostate 
1
cancer are more than twice as likely to be diagnosed 
2
with prostate cancer than men without a family his-
3
tory. 
4
(8) The common clinical definition for men at 
5
high-risk of prostate cancer includes African-Amer-
6
ican men and men with a family history. 
7
(9) Most of the major cancer and urological so-
8
cieties recommend beginning screening discussions 
9
earlier for African-American men and those with a 
10
family history of prostate cancer. 
11
(10) The United States Preventive Services 
12
Task Force has encouraged research on screening 
13
African-American men, including whether to screen 
14
African-American men at younger ages, and has 
15
identified this research as a high-priority cancer re-
16
search gap. 
17
(11) Barriers to screening should be minimized 
18
for high-risk men in order to catch asymptomatic 
19
prostate cancer before it metastasizes and the sur-
20
vival rate is dramatically reduced. 
21
(12) The cost of treating metastatic prostate 
22
cancer in the United States health care system is 
23
hundreds of millions of dollars more annually than 
24
the cost of treating localized, early-stage cancer.
