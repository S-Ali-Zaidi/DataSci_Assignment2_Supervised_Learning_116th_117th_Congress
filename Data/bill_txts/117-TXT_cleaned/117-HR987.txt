RESOLUTION 
Expressing gratitude on behalf of the people of the United 
States to the journalists and news staff who are risking 
injury and death, are subject to grave threat, and have 
sacrificed their lives, to chronicle and report on the ongo-
ing war in Ukraine resulting from Putin’s invasion. 
Whereas Ukraine declared independence from the Soviet 
Union on August 24, 1991, and that independence was 
reaffirmed in a popular referendum on December 1, 
1991; 
Whereas, on February 24, 2022, the Russian military in-
vaded the sovereign country of Ukraine under the direc-
tion of the President of the Russian Federation Vladimir

Whereas the Geneva Conventions’ Protocol I includes the 
Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts, 
prohibiting attacks on civilian persons and populations, 
and defines journalists and war correspondents as civil-
ians; 
Whereas the Russian Federation was an original signatory to 
the Geneva Conventions, until Putin removed the Russian 
Federation from Protocol I, which protects civilians, in 
October 2019, demonstrating a clear disregard for inno-
cent life; 
Whereas, as of March 15, 2022, a total of 691 civilians, in-
cluding children, are recorded as having been killed dur-
ing the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine; 
Whereas journalists and news staff are on the ground in 
Ukraine reporting freelance and for global networks and 
media, and are working on documentary efforts to record 
the ongoing humanitarian crisis and war caused by 
Putin’s invasion of the sovereign country of Ukraine; 
Whereas many of the journalists and news staff covering the 
war in Ukraine are American citizens or working for 
American news agencies; 
Whereas indiscriminate shelling by Russian Federation forces 
has gone so far as to shell humanitarian corridors, ma-
ternity hospitals, schools, and other primarily civilian lo-
cations; 
Whereas journalists and news staff are on the ground along 
Russian-targeted humanitarian corridors and in major 
cities across Ukraine; 
Whereas dozens of members of the free press have been mur-
dered or injured by Putin’s forces as of March 15, 2022,

was struck by incoming arms fire in Horenka, Ukraine; 
Whereas, on March 6, 2022, Swiss journalist Guillaume Bri-
quet was wounded and robbed by Russia soldiers who 
shot at his car on the road to Mykolaiv, Ukraine; 
Whereas it is possible that additional Ukrainian and foreign 
press have been or will be injured and killed so long as 
Putin’s forces continue their brutal attack on civilians; 
Whereas all civilians, including journalists and news staff, 
should be spared violence by military forces; 
Whereas Putin and his cronies have demonstrated complete 
disregard for innocent life, Ukraine’s sovereignty, the 
right to free speech, and the rights and value of a free 
press; 
Whereas Putin is engaged in a propaganda war, as well as 
a military war, and the Russian Federation continues to 
push a false narrative about their presence in Ukraine; 
Whereas the United States supports a free and fair press and 
rejects any and all propagandist efforts by the Russian 
Federation to cover up and hide the truth behind Putin’s 
invasion; 
Whereas journalists and news staff on the ground in Ukraine 
who are reporting the truth to the world, including Amer-
ican journalists and news staff, are instrumental in com-
bating false propaganda pushed by Putin and his cronies; 
and 
Whereas despite the overwhelming threat and risk to their 
lives and the sacrifices already made, journalists and 
news staff continue to report bravely from Ukraine: Now, 
therefore, be it
