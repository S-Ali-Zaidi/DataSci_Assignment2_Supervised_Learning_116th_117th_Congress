To direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to develop and

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) According to data from the Department of 
8
Veterans Affairs, several medical centers of the De-

partment are managed by acting or temporary direc-
1
tors. 
2
(2) Some of these medical centers have not 
3
been managed by a permanent director for a long 
4
period. 
5
(3) Pursuant to section 317.903 of title 5, Code 
6
of Federal Regulations, a member of the senior exec-
7
utive service who is detailed to a temporary position 
8
in a department or agency of the Federal Govern-
9
ment may not serve in that position for periods 
10
longer than 120-day increments, and no member of 
11
the senior executive service may be detailed to an 
12
unclassified position for a period longer than 240 
13
days. 
14
(4) The inability of the Department of Veterans 
15
Affairs to recruit qualified, permanent candidates as 
16
directors of medical centers, combined with the poli-
17
cies described in paragraph (3), leads to frequent 
18
turnover of directors at the medical centers which 
19
impedes the ability of system management to engage 
20
in long-term planning and other functions necessary 
21
to improve service delivery to veterans. 
22
(5) The Secretary of Veterans Affairs should 
23
develop a comprehensive plan to recruit permanent
