9
FINANCE CORPORATION IS POSITIONED TO 
10
ACHIEVE NATIONAL SECURITY, ECONOMIC, 
11
AND DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES. 
12
(a) IN GENERAL.— 
13
(1) When establishing the U.S. International 
14
Development Finance Corporation (DFC), Congress 
15
sought to facilitate the participation of private sector 
16
capital and skills in the economic development of 
17
countries with low- or lower-middle-income econo-
18
mies and countries transitioning from nonmarket to 
19
market economies in order to complement United 
20
States assistance and foreign policy objectives. 
21
(2) The priority for such support has been and 
22
remains intended for less developed countries with a 
23
low-income economy or a lower-middle-income econ-
24
omy; however, using income as a discriminator for 
25

H3524

•HR 3524 IH
which countries merit investment will not often cap-
1
ture other important factors, such as the wealth dis-
2
parity within a country, vulnerability to external 
3
shocks including from natural disasters, and United 
4
States foreign policy and national security concerns. 
5
For this reason, Congress has currently authorized 
6
DFC investment in less developed countries with an 
7
upper-middle-income economy where the President 
8
certifies to the appropriate congressional committees 
9
that such support furthers the national economic or 
10
foreign policy interests of the United States and 
11
such support is designed to produce significant de-
12
velopmental outcomes or provide developmental ben-
13
efits to the poorest population of that country. 
14
(3) It is the intent of Congress that this flexi-
15
bility in DFC directed assistance be made available 
16
to all countries, including those with so-called high- 
17
income economies such as the Bahamas, Barbados, 
18
Chile, Trinidad and Tobago, and other allies and 
19
partners exceeding the Gross National Income per 
20
Capita definition threshold for high-income country. 
21
Otherwise, previously eligible partner countries find 
22
themselves now ineligible. 
23
(4) The United States already provides a simi-
24
lar national security interest exception for high in-

come countries under the European Energy Security 
1
and Diversification Act of 2019, which gives the 
2
DFC the authority to work in Europe and Eurasia 
3
on energy and energy related investments regardless 
4
of the income status of the countries. 
5
(5) While continuing to prioritize DFC invest-
6
ment in low and lower-middle income countries, it is 
7
the sense of Congress that the DFC should support

SEC. 121. FINDINGS ON REGIONAL ECONOMIC ORDER. 
22
Congress makes the following findings: 
23
(1) The United States played a leadership role 
24
in constructing the architecture, rules, and norms 
25

•HR 3524 IH
governing the international economic order following 
1
the Second World War, yielding decades of domestic 
2
economic and geopolitical prosperity and stability. 
3
(2) In 2017, the United States withdrew from 
4
the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), an economic 
5
pact that was negotiated by 12 countries that cov-
6
ered 40 percent of the world economy, leading the 
7
11 remaining Asia-Pacific countries to sign the 
8
Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for 
9
Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) the following 
10
year, setting high-standard rules for regional eco-
11
nomic engagement. 
12
(3) In 2020, the 10 countries of the Association 
13
of Southeast Asian Nations along with South Korea, 
14
China, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand signed 
15
the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership 
16
(RCEP), the world’s biggest trade deal in terms of 
17
GDP. 
18
(4) Reduced United States economic engage-
19
ment has led United States allies and partners to 
20
question the United States commitment to the Indo- 
21
Pacific region. Despite its distortive and unfair trade 
22
practices, the People’s Republic of China is taking 
23
advantage of this vacuum by deepening its partner-

1
economic model. 
2
(5) The United States is increasingly on the 
3
outside looking in with regards to economic pacts in 
4
the Indo-Pacific. United States absence from these 
5
agreements puts it at both a strategic and competi-
6
tive disadvantage in the region and allows competi-
7
tors to expand their economic influence at the 
8
United States expense. 
9
(6) Given that these partnerships and agree-
10
ments will define the rules and norms that will gov-
11
ern regional commerce over the coming decades, the 
12
United States is currently not well positioned to 
13
shape the coming economic landscape. 
14
(7) It is in the United States vital interest to 
15
upgrade its economic engagement and leadership in 
16
the Indo-Pacific and develop concrete steps to 
17
strengthen its commercial diplomacy to fully par-
18
ticiple in the region’s economic dynamism.

(2) APEC is a hub of trade and commerce for 
3
21 member economies that, as of 2018, accounted 
4
for 60 percent of global GDP and 48 percent of 
5
global trade; 
6
(3) APEC has contributed to the reduction in 
7
trade barriers, harmonization of regulations, and en-
8
hanced access to global value chains, while raising 
9
the profile of critical topics such as fair trade, sus-
10
tainability, gender parity, and inclusive growth;

(4) it is in the United States interest to engage 
12
and lead at APEC to push for an open and inclusive 
13
regional economy that benefits United States work-
14
ers, consumers, and businesses and better integrates 
15

trade would allow the United States to unite a group 
19
of like-minded economies around common standards

retail banks, investment banks, asset managers, and 
23
insurers which are given favorable treatment under 
24

strict restrictions on their ability to operate in

China. 
2
(2) On October 24, 2020, Chinese billionaire 
3
Jack Ma referred to ‘‘pawnshop mentality’’ of state- 
4
owned banks. Shortly thereafter, the initial public 
5
offering of his firm Ant Financial was canceled by 
6
Chinese regulators. 
7
(3) In order to join the World Trade Organiza-
8
tion (WTO) in 2001, the Chinese Government com-
9
mitted to opening the credit card payment business 
10
to foreign firms by 2006. 
11
(4) After years of China refusing to open its 
12
payment market, the United States brought a case 
13
against China before the WTO. In 2012, the WTO 
14
mandated China to open its card payment market to 
15
global competitors. 
16
(5) Even after the WTO’s ruling, the PRC Gov-
17
ernment refused to comply with the ruling and 
18
maintained a rule that required all yuan-denomi-
19
nated payment cards to utilize China’s Union Pay 
20
network. Only in 2020, after the Chinese payment 
21
market had grown to $27 trillion, did the PRC Gov-
22
ernment approve the application of foreign firms to 
23
enter the market.

capital controls, limiting access to the Chinese mar-
2
ket to foreign investors while hamstringing its own

citizens ability to control their money.

(7) On November 5, 2018, Chinese President 
5
Xi Jinping announced that China would launch a 
6
technology innovation stock exchange. The Shanghai

(1) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
19
(A) The Taiwan Relations Act (Public Law

1
all other peoples of the Western Pacific area’’. 
2
(B) Consistent with the Asia Reassurance 
3

(C) Despite a concerted campaign by the 
8
People’s Republic of China to isolate Taiwan 
9
from its diplomatic partners and from inter-
10
national organizations, including the World 
11
Health Organization, Taiwan has emerged as a 
12
global leader in the coronavirus global pandemic 
13
response, including by donating more than 
14
2,000,000 surgical masks and other medical 
15
equipment to the United States. 
16
(D) The creation of a United States fellow-
17

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following find-
16
ings: 
17
(1) In fiscal year 2020, the Department of

strengthening the good governance and sovereignty 
20
of states that adhere to and uphold the rules-based 
21
international order; and

SEC. 231. FINDINGS ON MULTILATERAL ENGAGEMENT. 
12
Congress finds the following: 
13
(1) Every UN member state is legally required 
14
to finance the UN’s core budget in order to ensure 
15
that these missions are properly resourced, and as-
16
sessment rates are renegotiated every three years by 
17
the UN General Assembly. 
18
(2) While the United States is the largest single 
19
financial contributor to the UN system, the current 
20
model is beneficial because it requires all UN mem-
21
ber states, no matter how big or small, to help 
22
shoulder the UN’s regular and peacekeeping budgets 
23
at specified levels. 
24
22:42 Jun 24, 2021
H3524
142 
•HR 3524 IH
(3) Failing to meet our financial commitments 
1
to the UN also empowers the PRC, which has raised 
2
our annual shortfalls to claim we are not a reliable 
3
partner and is seeking to leverage its own contribu-
4
tions to the regular budget and peacekeeping in 
5
ways that run counter to United States interests and 
6
values. 
7
(4) The People’s Republic of China is now the 
8
second largest financial contributor to UN peace-
9
keeping, having gone from an assessment rate of 
10
just 3 percent in 2008 to more than 15 percent 
11
today, and is the ninth largest troop-contributor to 
12
UN missions, providing more personnel than the 
13
other four permanent members of the Security 
14
Council combined. 
15
(5) With greater engagement comes greater in-
16
fluence, and PRC diplomats have sought to use their 
17
expanded clout to push back against the human 
18
rights, civilian protection, and gender-based violence 
19
aspects of UN peacekeeping mandates, using United 
20
States funding shortfalls as a pretext. 
21
(6) The PRC has also used its growing clout to 
22
fill key posts at UN agencies: Chinese nationals cur-
23
rently occupy the top posts of four of the UN’s 15

(7) From 2021 to 2022, there will be 15 elec-
3
tions for the heads of UN specialized agencies and 
4
five for major UN funds and programs. With the ex-
5
ception of the World Food Programme, none are 
6
currently led by Americans. 
7
(8) A 2020 Department of State Inspector Gen-
8
eral Inspection found that the Bureau for Inter-
9
national Organizations did not have a standard oper-
10
ating procedure for tracking and promoting the em-
11
ployment of American Citizens in the UN system,

and their recommendation to the department to es-
13
tablish one remains open.

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following find-
7
ings: 
8
(1) The United States shares with the Carib-
9
bean a collective vulnerability to natural disasters, 
10
which affects the lives and the economies of our citi-
11
zens. 
12
(2) The April 9, 2021, eruption of the La 
13
Soufriere volcano is another reminder of the devas-
14
tation caused by the many natural disasters the Car-
15
ibbean confronts each year and the region’s vulner-
16
ability to external shocks. Hurricane Dorian, the 
17
largest storm to hit the region, wiped out large parts 
18
of the northern Bahamas in 2019, and Hurricanes 
19
Maria and Irma devastated multiple islands across 
20
the region in 2017, including Puerto Rico. According 
21
to IMF research, of the 511 plus disasters worldwide 
22
to hit small states since 1950, around two-thirds 
23
(324) have been in the Caribbean.

(3) This region is seven times more likely to ex-
1
perience a natural disaster than elsewhere. And, 
2
when one occurs, it will incur as much as six times 
3
more damage. 
4
(4) Extreme weather events and other environ-
5
mental impacts will only worsen over the coming 
6
years, and if not addressed, we will see only increas-
7
ing economic shocks on these countries, driving ir-
8
regular migration. 
9
(5) While the United States has considerable 
10
expertise and capacity in assisting countries with 
11
disaster response, there remains a need for stronger 
12
partnerships that build regional resilience through 
13
efficient and interoperable platforms, protecting peo-
14
ple and speeding recovery. 
15
(6) The People’s Republic of China has dra-
16
matically increased its engagement in the Caribbean 
17
in the past five years, including offering loans and 
18
grants related to disaster response and resilience 
19
and sought to acquire property rights in the Carib-
20
bean that would be detrimental to United States na-
21
tional security interests.

SEC. 301. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE CONTINUED VIOLA-
13
TION OF RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OF THE 
14
PEOPLE OF HONG KONG. 
15
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
16
(1) Despite international condemnation, the 
17
Government of the People’s Republic of China 
18
(‘‘PRC’’) continues to disregard its international 
19
legal obligations under the Joint Declaration of the 
20
Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain 
21
and Northern Ireland and the Government of the 
22
People’s Republic of China on the Question of Hong 
23
Kong (‘‘Joint Declaration’’), in which the PRC com-
24
mitted that—

•HR 3524 IH
(A) Hong Kong would enjoy a high degree 
1
of autonomy; 
2
(B) for at least 50 years the ‘‘social and 
3
economic systems in Hong Kong’’ would remain 
4
unchanged; and 
5
(C) the personal rights and freedoms of 
6
the people of Hong Kong would be protected by 
7
law. 
8
(2) As part of its continued efforts to under-
9
mine the established rights of the Hong Kong peo-
10
ple, the PRC National People’s Congress Standing 
11
Committee (‘‘Standing Committee’’) passed and im-
12
posed upon Hong Kong oppressive and intentionally 
13
vague national security legislation on June 30, 2020, 
14
that grants Beijing sweeping powers to punish acts 
15
of ‘‘separating the country, subverting state power, 
16
and organizing terroristic activities’’. 
17
(3) The legislative process by which the Stand-
18
ing Committee imposed the national security law on 
19
Hong Kong bypassed Hong Kong’s local government 
20
in a potential violation of the Basic Law of the 
21
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the 
22
People’s Republic of China (‘‘Basic Law’’), and in-
23
volved unusual secrecy, as demonstrated by the fact 
24
that the legislation was only the second law since

7
postponed for a year until September 5, 2021, by 
8
citing the public health risk of holding elections dur-
9
ing the COVID–19 pandemic. 
10
(5) On July 31, 2020, in an attempt to assert 
11
extraterritorial jurisdiction, the HKSAR Govern-
12
ment announced indictments of and arrest warrants 
13
for six Hong Kong activists living overseas, includ-
14
ing United States citizen Samuel Chu, for alleged 
15
violations of the national security law. 
16
(6) On November 11, 2020, the HKSAR Gov-
17
ernment removed four lawmakers from office for al-
18
legedly violating the law after the Standing Com-
19
mittee passed additional legislation barring those

who promoted or supported Hong Kong independ-

SEC. 305. SENSE OF CONGRESS CONDEMNING THE ONGO-
10
ING GENOCIDE AND CRIMES AGAINST HU-
11
MANITY AGAINST UYGHURS AND OTHER MI-
12
NORITY GROUPS. 
13
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
14
(1) On December 9, 1948, the United Nations 
15
General Assembly unanimously adopted the Conven-
16
tion on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime 
17
of Genocide (the Genocide Convention) signifying a 
18
commitment in response to the Holocaust and other 
19
crimes against humanity committed in the first half 
20
of the twentieth century. 
21
(2) The Genocide Convention entered into force 
22
on January 12, 1951, and declares that all state 
23
parties ‘‘confirm that genocide, whether committed 
24
in time of peace or in time of war, is a crime under 
25
22:42 Jun 24, 2021
H3524
294 
•HR 3524 IH
international law which they undertake to prevent 
1
and to punish’’. 
2
(3) The Genocide Convention defines genocide 
3
as ‘‘any of the following acts committed with intent 
4
to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, 
5
racial or religious group, as such: (a) Killing mem-
6
bers of the group; (b) Causing serious bodily or 
7
mental harm to members of the group; (c) Delib-
8
erately inflicting on the group conditions of life cal-
9
culated to bring about its physical destruction in 
10
whole or in part; (d) Imposing measures intended to 
11
prevent births within the group; (e) Forcibly trans-
12
ferring children of the group to another group’’. 
13
(4) The United States ratified the Genocide 
14
Convention with the understanding that the commis-
15
sion of genocide requires ‘‘the specific intent to de-
16
stroy, in whole or in substantial part, a [protected] 
17
group as such’’. 
18
(5) The People’s Republic of China (PRC) is a 
19
state party to the Genocide Convention. 
20
(6) Since 2017, the PRC Government, under 
21
the direction and control of the Chinese Communist 
22
Party (CCP), has detained and sought to indoctri-
23
nate more than one million Uyghurs and members 
24
of other ethnic and religious minority groups. 
25
22:42 Jun 24, 2021
H3524

•HR 3524 IH
(7) Recent data indicate a significant drop in 
1
birth rates among Uyghurs due to enforced steriliza-
2
tion, enforced abortion, and more onerous birth 
3
quotas for Uyghurs compared to Han. 
4
(8) There are credible reports of PRC Govern-
5
ment campaigns to promote marriages between 
6
Uyghurs and Han and to reduce birth rates among 
7
Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims. 
8
(9) Many Uyghurs reportedly have been as-
9
signed to factory employment under conditions that 
10
indicate forced labor, and some former detainees 
11
have reported food deprivation, beatings, suppression 
12
of religious practices, family separation, and sexual 
13
abuse. 
14
(10) This is indicative of a systematic effort to 
15
eradicate the ethnic and cultural identity and reli-
16
gious beliefs, and prevent the births of, Uyghurs, 
17
ethnic Kazakhs and Kyrgyz, and members of reli-
18
gious minority groups. 
19
(11) The birth rate in the Xinjiang region fell 
20
by 24 percent in 2019 compared to a 4.2 percent de-
21
cline nationwide. 
22
(12) On January 19, 2021, the Department of 
23
State determined the PRC Government, under the 
24
direction and control of the CCP, has committed 
25
22:42 Jun 24, 2021

296 
•HR 3524 IH
crimes against humanity and genocide against 
1
Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious minority 
2
groups in Xinjiang. 
3
(13) Secretary of State Antony Blinken and 
4
Former Secretary of State Michael Pompeo have 
5
both stated that what has taken place in Xinjiang is 
6
genocide and constitutes crimes against humanity. 
7
(14) Article VIII of the Genocide Convention 
8
provides, ‘‘Any Contracting Party may call upon the 
9
competent organs of the United Nations to take 
10
such action under the Charter of the United Nations 
11
as they consider appropriate for the prevention and 
12
suppression of acts of genocide’’. 
13
(15) The International Court of Justice has 
14
stated that it is the obligation of all state parties to 
15
the Genocide Convention to ‘‘employ all means rea-
16
sonably available to them, so as to prevent genocide 
17
so far as possible’’. 
18
(16) The United States is a Permanent Mem-
19
ber of the United Nations Security Council. 
20
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
21
gress that Congress— 
22
(1) finds that the ongoing abuses against

(b) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following find-
15
ings: 
16
(1) The Government of the People’s Republic of 
17
China (PRC) has a long history of repressing Turkic 
18
Muslims and other Muslim minority groups, particu-
19
larly Uyghurs, in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Re-
20
gion (‘‘Xinjiang’’ or ‘‘XUAR’’), also known as East 
21
Turkestan. Central and regional PRC government 
22
policies have systematically discriminated against 
23
these minority groups by denying them a range of 
24
civil and political rights, particularly freedom of reli-
25
22:42 Jun 24, 2021

327 
•HR 3524 IH
gion. Senior Chinese Communist Party officials bear 
1
direct responsibility for these gross human rights 
2
violations. 
3
(2) PRC government abuses include the arbi-
4
trary detention of more than 1,000,000 Uyghurs, 
5
ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and members of other Mus-
6
lim minority groups, separation of working age 
7
adults from their children and elderly parents, and 
8
the integration of forced labor into supply chains. 
9
Those held in detention facilities and internment 
10
camps in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region 
11
have described forced political indoctrination, tor-
12
ture, beatings, food deprivation, sexual assault, co-
13
ordinated campaigns to reduce birth rates among 
14
Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims through forced 
15
sterilization, and denial of religious, cultural, and 
16
linguistic freedoms. Recent media reports indicate 
17
that since 2019, the PRC government has newly 
18
constructed, expanded, or fortified at least 60 deten-
19
tion facilities with higher security or prison-like fea-
20
tures in Xinjiang.

ings: 
4
(1) Since the onset of the COVID–19 pan-
5
demic, crimes and discrimination against Asians and 
6
those of Asian descent have risen dramatically 
7
worldwide. In May 2020, United Nations Secretary- 
8
General Antonio Guterres said ‘‘the pandemic con-
9
tinues to unleash a tsunami of hate and xenophobia, 
10
scapegoating and scare-mongering’’ and urged gov-
11
ernments to ‘‘act now to strengthen the immunity of 
12
our societies against the virus of hate’’.

(2) Asian American and Pacific Island (AAPI) 
14
workers make up a large portion of the essential 
15
workers on the frontlines of the COVID–19 pan-

healthcare workers in the United States. AAPI 
18
workers also make up a large share—between 6 per-
19
cent and 12 percent based on sector—of the bio-
20
medical field.

22

and vibrancy of the United States is enhanced by

the diverse ethnic backgrounds and tolerance of its

14

dependence on the People’s Republic of China

5
public of China’s diplomatic and strategic goals;

and 
7

8
ments and among other political elites to enable 
9
People’s Republic of China state-backed firms 
10
to pursue predatory and exploitative economic

practices. 
12
(7) Thwarting these tactics by Russian, Chi-
13
nese, and other kleptocratic actors requires the 
14
international community to strengthen democratic 
15
governance and the rule of law. International co-
16
operation in combating corruption and illicit finance 
17
is vital to such efforts, especially by empowering re-
18

19
openings for the establishment of the rule of law in
