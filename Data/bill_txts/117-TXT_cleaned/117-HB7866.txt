3
Regulations, and the Section 8(a) Business Develop-
4
ment Program of the Small Business Administration 
5
(established under section 8(a) of the Small Busi-
6
ness Act (15 U.S.C. 637)), discrimination and re-
7
lated barriers continue to pose significant obstacles 
8
for minority- and women-owned businesses seeking 
9
to do business in federally assisted transportation 
10
markets across the United States and through pro-
11
curement contracts of Federal agencies. 
12
(2) The continuing barriers described in para-
13
graph (1) merit the continuation of the Disadvan-
14
taged Business Enterprise program, the ACDBE 
15
program, and the Section 8(a) Business Develop-
16
ment Program. 
17
(3) Congress has received and reviewed testi-
18
mony and documentation of race and gender dis-
19
crimination from numerous sources, including con-
20
gressional hearings and roundtables, scientific re-
21
ports, reports issued by public and private agencies, 
22

23
tions and individuals, and discrimination lawsuits,

1
alone are insufficient to address the problem.

(4) Some examples of the sources described in 
3
paragraph (3) include the following:

(A) The hearing of the Committee on

(6) The testimony and documentation described

that there is a compelling need for the continuation
