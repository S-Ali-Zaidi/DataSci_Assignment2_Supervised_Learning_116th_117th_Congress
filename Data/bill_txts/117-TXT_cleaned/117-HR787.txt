Whereas, on November 11, our Nation observes Veterans 
Day, a Federal holiday commemorating the men and 
women who served and sacrificed for their country; 
Whereas the service and sacrifice of all American veterans 
must be recognized; 
Whereas the service of approximately 30,000 current resi-
dents of the District of Columbia in the Armed Forces 
is unparalleled because they served without voting rep-
resentation in Congress and full local self-government; 
Whereas residents of the District of Columbia fought to cre-
ate the United States, fighting for the Revolutionary War 
slogan of ‘‘no taxation without representation’’, and have 
served in every war fought by the United States since; 
Whereas 635 District of Columbia residents were casualties

of World War II, a casualty figure greater than that of 
4 different States during that war;

resentation in the House of Representatives and the Sen-
ate, as well as full local self-government; 
Whereas the Washington, D.C. Admission Act (H.R. 51 and 
S. 51) would grant full and equal voting rights in Con-
gress as well as unimpeded democratic control over local 
affairs to the District of Columbia by making it the 51st 
State; and 
Whereas H.R. 51 was passed by the House of Representa-
tives on April 22, 2021: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives recog-
1
nizes the service of all District of Columbia veterans, con-
2
demns the denial of voting representation in Congress and 
3
full local self-government for veterans and their families 
4
who are District of Columbia residents, and calls for state-
5
hood for the District of Columbia through the enactment 
6
of the Washington, D.C. Admission Act (H.R. 51 and S. 
7
51), particularly in light of the service of District of Co-
8
lumbia veterans in every American war.
