incumbency disadvantages as they establish a foot-
1
hold, including suboptimal resource location relative 
2
to existing grid infrastructure and the lack of econo-
3
mies of scale. 
4
(2) Energy sector innovation can confer numer-
5
ous benefits to jobs and the economy, the environ-
6
ment and climate, and the general social welfare. 
7
(3) Energy sector innovation can come in nu-
8
merous forms, not all of which are readily quantifi-
9
able, including— 
10
(A) diversifying and increasing the Na-
11
tion’s energy generation portfolio and energy 
12
security, 
13
(B) improving the dispatchability and reli-
14
ability of energy generation, and 
15
(C) improving energy efficiency, emissions 
16
reductions, or other markers of performance.
