SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) During the 20-year period preceding the 
3
date of enactment of this Act, activity by private eq-
4
uity funds has exploded. 
5
(2) Millions of people in communities across the 
6
United States rely on companies that are owned by 
7
private equity funds, including nearly 12,000,000 in-
8
dividuals who work for companies owned by those 
9
funds. For millions of additional individuals, a pri-
10
vate investment fund acts as a landlord, a lender, or 
11
an owner of a local grocery store, newspaper, or hos-
12
pital. Many pension funds are also investors in pri-
13
vate investment funds. 
14
(3) Private investment funds have taken con-
15
trolling stakes in companies in a wide variety of in-
16
dustries, including the financial services, real estate, 
17
media, and healthcare industries, but some of the 
18
largest impacts from private investment funds have 
19
been in the retail sector. In the 5 years preceding 
20
the date of enactment of this Act, cases have been 
21
commenced under title 11, United States Code, with 
22
respect to dozens of retailers in the United States, 
23
including Sears, Toys ‘‘R’’ Us, Shopko, Payless

ShoeSource, Charlotte Russe, Bon-Ton, Nine West, 
1
David’s Bridal, Claire’s, J. Crew, Neiman Marcus, 
2
Guitar Center, Art Van Furniture, and Southeastern 
3
Grocers, which was the parent company for BI–LO 
4
and Winn-Dixie. 
5
(4) Private investment funds have also targeted 
6
entities that serve low-income or vulnerable popu-
7
lations, including affordable housing developments, 
8
for-profit colleges, payday lenders, medical providers, 
9
and nursing homes. 
10
(5) While private investment funds often pur-
11
port to take over struggling companies and make 
12
those companies viable, the opposite is often true. 
13
Leveraged buyouts impose enormous debt loads on 
14
otherwise viable companies and then strip those 
15
companies of assets, hobbling the operations of those 
16
companies and preventing them from making nec-
17
essary investments for future growth. If an invest-
18
ment goes well, the fund reaps most of the rewards, 
19
but if the investment does not go well, workers and 
20
customers of the company, and the community rely-
21
ing on the company, suffer. 
22
(6) Regardless of the performance of a private 
23
investment fund, the managers of the fund often 
24
make profits through fees, dividends, and other fi-
25
22:09 Oct 22, 2021

nancial engineering. Private funds should have a 
1
stake in the outcome of their investments, enjoying 
2
returns if those investments are successful but ab-
3
sorbing losses if those investments fail. 
4
(7) When a case is commenced under title 11, 
5
United States Code, with respect to a portfolio com-
6
pany, workers not only lose jobs, but also lose wages 
7
and benefits that are owed, severance pay that has 
8
been promised, and pensions that have been earned. 
9
Workers should not be sent to the back of the line 
10
behind other creditors if, through no fault of those 
11
workers, an investment fails. 
12
(8) The performance of private investment 
13
funds is often cloaked in secrecy. Those funds have 
14
full control over the information that the funds dis-
15
close to investors, which allows the funds to manu-
16
facture their own performance metrics and makes it 
17
difficult for an investor to compare the returns to 
18
other investment options. Funds also increasingly re-
19
quire investors to waive the fiduciary obligations ap-
20
plicable to the funds. Investors should have the in-
21
formation and bargaining power to take control over 
22
their own investments. 
23
(9) An increasing amount of risky debt is being 
24
introduced into the market and the quality of that 
25
22:09 Oct 22, 2021
H5648

•HR 5648 IH
debt is deteriorating, raising concerns with regu-
1
lators and lawmakers about systemic risk. The insti-
2
tutions that make and securitize risky loans collect 
3
large fees and then pass on risk to unwitting inves-
4
tors. The financial system should not bear all of the 
5
risk while lenders and securitizers reap the rewards. 
6
(10) The Federal Government should— 
7
(A) protect workers, companies, con-
8
sumers, and investors in the United States; and 
9
(B) put an end to the practice of looting 
10
economically viable companies for the enrich-
11
ment of private investment fund managers.
