•HRES 1228 IH 
Whereas Roe v. Wade’s one-size fits all mandate has pre-
vented States from enforcing laws that would save count-
less lives; 
Whereas more than 63,000,000 unborn lives have been lost 
to abortion since Roe v. Wade; 
Whereas abortion restrictions in the United States are out of 
step with the international mainstream, as 47 out of 50 
European nations limit elective abortion after 15 weeks; 
Whereas advancements in modern science and technology 
have revealed unborn babies have a heartbeat at 6 weeks, 
develop pain receptors at 7 weeks, have arms, fingers, 
and toes at 10 weeks, and have fully developed hearts at 
15 weeks; 
Whereas help is available to expectant and new mothers and 
their babies, many times at little or no cost, through 
2,700 pregnancy centers nationwide who provide services 
such as ultrasounds, diapers, baby outfits, STI/STD 
tests, parenting/prenatal education, maternity housing, 
and assistance in finding employment; 
Whereas a recent survey conducted by the Charlotte Lozier 
Institute shows that an estimated 828,131 lives have 
been saved by pregnancy resource centers since 2016; 
Whereas an opportunity to right the wrongs of Roe v. Wade 
was presented in the case Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s 
Health Organization; and 
Whereas the Supreme Court in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s 
Health Organization held that ‘‘the Constitution does not 
confer a right to abortion. Roe and Casey must be over-
ruled, and the authority to regulate abortion must be re-
turned to the people and their elected representatives.’’: 
Now, therefore, be it
