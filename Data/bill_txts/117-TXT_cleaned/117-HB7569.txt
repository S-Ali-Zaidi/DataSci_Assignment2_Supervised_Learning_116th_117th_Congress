(1) Addressing cybersecurity vulnerabilities in 
1
energy-related critical infrastructure after an intru-
2
sion occurs is inefficient, ineffective, and costly. 
3
(2) Integrating cybersecurity considerations 
4
into the research, design, and development of energy 
5
infrastructure represents a cost-effective approach to 
6
enhancing the security, resilience, and reliability of 
7
the electric grid, oil and natural gas pipelines, and 
8
other energy distribution, transmission, and genera-
9
tion systems. 
10
(3) Successfully employing the approach out-
11
lined in paragraph (2) as a guiding principle for the 
12
Department’s energy infrastructure activities will re-
13
quire a diverse, inclusive, and highly skilled work-
14
force which possesses energy-specific cybersecurity 
15
expertise and familiarity with associated research, 
16
development, and demonstration needs. 
17
(4) A dedicated science scholarship program at 
18
the 
Department 
for 
graduate 
students 
and 
19
postdoctoral researchers studying energy-specific cy-
20
bersecurity disciplines could help address the chal-
