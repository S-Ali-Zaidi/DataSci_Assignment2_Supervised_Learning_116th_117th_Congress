RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
United States policy should encourage Russian soldiers 
to abandon Putin’s war with Ukraine, and that Russian 
soldiers who defect should be granted expedited admis-
sion to the United States as refugees if they clear all 
applicable vetting and security procedures. 
Whereas, on February 24, 2022, the Russian military began 
a shameless full-scale invasion of Ukraine, including car-
rying out attacks on cities with ballistic missiles, artillery, 
and tanks; 
Whereas Russia has conscripted involuntary soldiers serving 
in its military;

Whereas there are reports that over 5,000 Russian troops 
have been killed or captured as of March 1, 2022;

military equipment; 
Whereas captured Russian soldiers have expressed confusion 
as to the purpose of the war with Ukraine; 
Whereas Russian military authorities have threatened phys-
ical abuse or worse to enforce discipline in some units; 
Whereas Russian soldiers could be executed for desertion; 
Whereas Russian soldiers and citizens have reported that 
they initially believed the Russian military was only con-
ducting training exercises; 
Whereas Russian soldiers may not and should not agree with 
Putin’s unjust war in Ukraine; 
Whereas Ukraine has offered amnesty and compensation for 
Russian soldiers who surrender; 
Whereas soldiers who defect can be considered refugees by 
the United Nations; and 
Whereas the United States has expedited procedures for im-
migration for other refugees: Now, therefore, be it
