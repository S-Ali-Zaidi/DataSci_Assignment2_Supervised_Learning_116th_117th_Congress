Whereas in Highland Park, Illinois, on July 4, 2022, thou-
sands of joyous spectators lined the Independence Day 
parade route expectantly waiting for their children and 
grandchildren, their friends, neighbors, and coworkers to 
walk by in procession; 
Whereas, at 10:14 a.m., just moments after the Highland 
Park Independence Day Parade began, the sense of com-
munity elation was shattered by a single person who ac-
quired a gun, climbed a ladder to a rooftop, and fired 80 
bullets into the joyous crowd below; 
Whereas the 7 individuals who lost their lives that day 
were—

nois, a beloved wife and mother, who was known for her 
kind, caring personality, and for bringing neighbors deli-
cious baked goods during the holidays; 
(2) Irina McCarthy, age 35, of Highland Park, Illi-
nois, a wife and mother of 2-year-old Aiden, who met her 
husband Kevin through their mutual work in the phar-
maceutical industry; 
(3) Kevin McCarthy, age 37, of Highland Park, Illi-
nois, a husband and father of 2-year-old Aiden, who died 
protecting his son from gunfire; 
(4) Stephen Strauss, age 88, of Highland Park, Illi-
nois, a brother, husband, father, and grandfather, who 
was a joke-teller and avid reader and greatly enjoyed the 
Art Institute of Chicago and the Chicago Symphony Or-
chestra; 
(5) Jacquelyn Sundheim, age 63, of Highland Park,
