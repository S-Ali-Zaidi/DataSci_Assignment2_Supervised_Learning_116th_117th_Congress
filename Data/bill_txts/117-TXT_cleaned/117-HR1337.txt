RESOLUTION 
Lauding Virgin Islanders for their perseverance, grit, and 
tenacity through major disasters attributable to Hurri-
canes Irma and Maria and Members of Congress for 
their support in accruing funding to support the Virgin 
Islands of the United States through these disasters. 
Whereas Hurricanes Irma and Maria, both Category 5 
storms with wind gusts of up to 178 miles per hour at 
their centers, impacted the Virgin Islands of the United 
States within two weeks of each other on September 6 
and September 20, 2017, and caused significant destruc-
tion to roofs, structures, foliage, and aerial power and 
phone lines leading to territorywide communications and 
power blackouts;

Whereas the sweeping destruction to homes and public facili-
ties including hospitals, schools, fire stations, utilities, 
and ports on St. Thomas, St. Croix, and St. John effec-
tively stranded the entire population for weeks, leading to 
Virgin Islanders running boats between the islands of the 
Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico to assist with transpor-
tation of people and goods; 
Whereas Virgin Islanders became heroes delivering food and 
medical supplies while also leading cleanup initiatives, 
and remained strong in the face of the daunting task of 
rebuilding their lives; 
Whereas Members of Congress, including leadership and com-
mittee chairs, came in large numbers to the Virgin Is-
lands to provide insight and support to the local govern-
ment and people of the territory; 
Whereas the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emer-
gency Assistance Act (‘‘the Stafford Act’’) provides dis-
aster assistance to States, Tribes, local governments, and 
certain private nonprofit organizations, and also declares 
a State to include the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, 
the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the 
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands; and 
Whereas Members of Congress have shown enormous support 
and willingness to ensure that the people of the Virgin 
Islands receive the necessary funding provided through 
Acts of Congress and support through the Stafford Act 
to facilitate and expand the scope of recovery: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
