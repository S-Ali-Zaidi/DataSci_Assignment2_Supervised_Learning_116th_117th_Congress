RESOLUTION 
Recognizing January 2022 as ‘‘National Mentoring Month’’. 
Whereas the goals of National Mentoring Month are to raise 
awareness of and celebrate the powerful impact of men-
toring relationships, recruit new mentors, and encourage 
institutions to integrate quality mentoring into their poli-
cies, practices, and programs; 
Whereas quality mentoring fosters positive life and social 
skills, promotes self-esteem, bolsters academic achieve-
ment and college access, supports career exploration, and 
nurtures youth leadership development;

Whereas mentoring happens in many settings, including com-
munity-based 
programs, 
elementary 
and 
secondary 
schools, institutions of higher education, government 
agencies, religious institutions, and the workplace, and in 
various ways, including formal mentoring matches and 
informal relationships with teachers, coaches, neighbors, 
faith leaders, and others; 
Whereas effective mentoring of underserved and vulnerable 
populations helps individuals confront challenges and 
enjoy improved mental health and social-emotional well- 
being; 
Whereas studies have shown that incorporating culture and 
heritage into mentoring programs can improve academic 
outcomes and increase community engagement, especially 
for Alaska Native and American Indian youth; 
Whereas youth development experts agree that mentoring en-
courages positive youth development and smart daily be-
haviors, such as finishing homework and having healthy 
social interactions, and has a positive impact on the 
growth and success of a young person; 
Whereas mentors help young people set career goals and can 
help connect mentees to industry professionals to train 
for and find jobs; 
Whereas mentoring programs generally have a significant, 
positive impact on youth academic achievement, school 
connectedness and engagement, and educational success, 
which leads to outcomes such as improved attendance, 
grades and test scores, and classroom behavior; 
Whereas research has found that young people facing a risk 
of not completing high school but who had a mentor 
were, compared with their peers, more likely to enroll in

college, to participate regularly in sports or extra-
curricular activities, to hold a leadership position in a 
club or sports team, and to volunteer regularly, and less 
likely to start using drugs; 
Whereas mentoring has long been a staple of juvenile justice 
and violence prevention efforts, and can offer comprehen-
sive support to youth at risk for committing violence or 
victimization, as mentoring can address many risk factors 
at once; 
Whereas mentoring relationships for youth facing risk, such 
as foster youth, can have a positive impact on a wide 
range of factors, including mental health, educational 
functioning and attainment, peer relationships, employ-
ment, and housing stability; 
Whereas mentoring programs have been found to positively 
impact many aspects of mental well-being, including re-
ducing unhealthy coping mechanisms, improving inter-
personal relationships, and reducing parental stress; 
Whereas mentoring is an innovative, evidence-based practice 
and, uniquely, is both a prevention and intervention 
strategy that can support young people of all demo-
graphics and backgrounds in all aspects of their lives; 
Whereas each of the benefits of mentors described in this pre-
amble serves to link youth to economic and social oppor-
tunity while also strengthening communities in the 
United States; 
Whereas, despite the benefits of mentoring, one young person 
of every three is growing up without a mentor, which 
means a third of the youth of the United States are 
growing up without someone outside of the home to offer 
real life guidance and support; and

Whereas this ‘‘mentoring gap’’ demonstrates the need for col-
laboration among the private, public, and nonprofit sec-
tors to increase resources for relationship-centric sup-
ports for youth in communities, schools, and workplaces: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—

cational achievement, engagement, and self-con-

11
(4) promotes the establishment and expansion 
12
of quality mentoring programs across the United

States to equip young people with the tools needed

16
gap’’ that exists for the many young people in the 
17
United States who do not have meaningful connec-
18
tions with adults outside the home.
