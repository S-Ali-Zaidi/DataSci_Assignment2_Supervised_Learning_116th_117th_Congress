CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 
Encouraging the Architect of the Capitol to transition to 
the exclusive use of electricity derived from renewable 
energy sources to power the United States Capitol Com-
plex by 2032. 
Whereas according to the 2018 National Climate Assessment, 
without substantial and sustained global mitigation and 
regional adaption efforts, climate change is expected to 
cause growing losses to American infrastructure and 
property and impede the rate of economic growth over 
this century; 
Whereas according to the 2018 Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Global Warm-
ing of 1.5° Celsius, to avoid the most devastating impacts 
of climate change, the world must limit the warming of

the global average temperature to 1.5° Celsius above 
preindustrial levels; 
Whereas according to the IPCC, reaching and sustaining net 
zero global anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions is 
necessary for halting anthropogenic global warming; 
Whereas according to the IPCC, in order to limit global 
warming to 1.5° Celsius above preindustrial levels, the 
world must achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, which will 
require rapid, dramatic changes in how governments, in-
dustries, and societies function; 
Whereas the IPCC has reported that in comparison to global 
warming of 1.5° Celsius, global warming of 2° Celsius 
will result in a greater number of severe heat waves, 
more extreme storms, increased poverty, and the deg-
radation of critical ecosystems; 
Whereas climate change impacts will be felt disproportion-
ately by communities of color and low-income commu-
nities; 
Whereas to address the urgent need to limit global warming 
to 1.5° Celsius, the IPCC has recommended increasing 
installation of renewable energy systems, with a goal of 
such systems generating 70 to 80 percent of global elec-
tricity by 2050; 
Whereas investing in the clean energy economy, with strong 
labor and procurement standards, will create quality jobs; 
Whereas according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration, 2020 was the warmest year on record 
globally; 
Whereas the world’s cities occupy 2 percent of global land 
mass, but are responsible for up to 70 percent of harmful 
greenhouse gas emissions;

Whereas more than 350 mayors in the United States have 
adopted the Paris Agreement goals for their cities, in-
cluding Washington, DC; 
Whereas in the fight against climate change, cities and coun-
ties have become important leaders because of their role 
as laboratories, incubators, and implementers of climate 
solutions; 
Whereas, on January 18, 2019, District of Columbia Mayor 
Muriel Bowser signed the CleanEnergy DC Omnibus 
Amendment Act of 2018, which mandates that, by 2032, 
100 percent of the electricity sold at retail in the District 
be derived from renewable energy sources, and also in-
cludes an ambitious building performance standard; and 
Whereas it is critical that Congress leads by example for 
American cities, communities, and people, by committing 
to renewable energy to combat climate change: Now, 
therefore, be it
