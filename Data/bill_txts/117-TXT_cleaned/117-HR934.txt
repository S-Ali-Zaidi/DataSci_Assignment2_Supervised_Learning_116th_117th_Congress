RESOLUTION 
Supporting reopening the United States Capitol and House 
Office Buildings to the American people. 
Whereas the United States Capitol and House Office Build-
ings closed to public visitation on March 12, 2020, at the 
very outset of the pandemic; 
Whereas, since March of 2020, the American people have 
learned how to safely gather and enter public places de-
spite the existence of COVID–19 and, due to Operation 
Warp Speed, have had the opportunity to be vaccinated 
against COVID–19 for more than a year;

Whereas, despite the existence of COVID–19, tens of thou-
sands of people routinely gather across the country for 
sporting, entertainment, worship, and other events; 
Whereas, despite the existence of COVID–19, stores, res-
taurants, and other public places have been successfully 
welcoming the public since the pandemic began in 2020; 
Whereas, despite the existence of COVID–19, the American 
people, including Members of Congress, routinely use 
crowded public transportation vehicles, including air-
planes and trains; 
Whereas, despite the existence of COVID–19, most Ameri-
cans have long since resumed working around co-workers, 
customers, and others; 
Whereas it is illogical and unacceptable that, despite the rest 
of the United States being open, the United States Cap-
itol and House Office Buildings, buildings that belong to 
the American people, remain largely closed to public visi-
tation; and 
Whereas it is time to once again welcome the public partici-
pation in the legislative process and the public visitation 
of our historic buildings that have always been hallmarks 
of American democracy: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) recognizes the importance of reopening the 
2
United States Capitol and House Office Buildings to 
3
the American people to facilitate public participation 
4
in the legislative process and public visitation of 
5
these historic buildings; and
