RESOLUTION 
Celebrating the 20-year commemoration of the International 
Underground Railroad Memorial Monument, comprised 
of the Gateway to Freedom Monument in Detroit, Michi-
gan, and the Tower of Freedom Monument in Windsor, 
Ontario, Canada. 
Whereas millions of Africans and their descendants were 
enslaved in the United States and the American colonies 
from 1619 through 1865; 
Whereas Africans forced into slavery were unspeakably de-
based, humiliated, dehumanized, brutally torn from their 
families and loved ones, and subjected to the indignity of 
being stripped of their names and heritage;

Whereas tens of thousands of people of African descent si-
lently escaped their chains to follow the perilous Under-
ground Railroad north toward freedom in Canada; 
Whereas the Detroit River played a central role for these pas-
sengers of the Underground Railroad on their way to 
freedom; 
Whereas in October 2001, the city of Detroit, Michigan, 
joined with Windsor and Essex County in Ontario, Can-
ada, to memorialize the courage of these freedom seekers 
with an international memorial monument to the Under-
ground Railroad, comprising the Tower of Freedom 
Monument in Windsor and the Gateway to Freedom 
Monument in Detroit; 
Whereas the deep roots that the formerly enslaved, refugees, 
and immigrants who reached Canada from the United 
States created in Canadian society remain as tributes to 
the determination of their descendants to safeguard the 
history of the struggles and endurance of their 
forebearers; 
Whereas the observance of the 20-year commemoration of the 
Underground Railroad Memorial will be celebrated on 
October 21, 2021, and may include the designation of an 
International Gateway to Freedom National Heritage 
Corridor and the nomination of the historic Detroit River 
jointly by the National Park Service and the Parks Can-
ada Agency for inclusion on the World Heritage Site list 
of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cul-
tural Organization (‘‘UNESCO’’) as a testament to the 
shared history of the United States and Canada; 
Whereas UNESCO has stated it is essential for the field of 
memorial sites linked to the slave trade and slavery to be

open to new dynamics, to become stronger in terms of 
geographical coverage, in-depth historical research, and 
repossession of the history and mobilization of new audi-
ences; 
Whereas UNESCO has emphasized the importance within the 
field of revisiting core concepts, redefining the cultural 
and ethical challenges, building capacities for managing 
sites, developing professional networks, developing lively 
interactive activities, and regularly assessing experiences 
and practices; 
Whereas UNESCO’s Slave Route Project: Resistance, Lib-
erty, Heritage encourages countries not only to identify, 
assess, restore, preserve, and promote their memorial 
sites and itineraries, but also to identify the heritage sites 
considered to be of Outstanding Universal Value, and en-
courages the designation of ‘‘Sites of Memory associated 
to the Slave Route’’ to assist the identification and rec-
ognition of sites and places with a particular significance; 
Whereas a cooperative international educational partnership 
project known as the Detroit River Project is dedicated 
to education and research with the goal of promoting 
cross-border understanding as well as economic develop-
ment and cultural heritage tourism, and includes an edu-
cational curriculum known as ‘‘Resistance Along the 
Fluid Frontier: The Detroit River Project International 
Freedom Curriculum’’; 
Whereas the designation of an International Gateway to 
Freedom National Heritage Corridor would include the 
States of Michigan, Illinois, Ohio, Wisconsin, Missouri, 
Indiana, and Kentucky; the Detroit, Mississippi, and 
Ohio Rivers, which traverse portions of those States; and

any other sites associated within the International Gate-

Whereas over the course of history, the United States has be-
come a symbol of democracy and freedom around the 
world; and 
Whereas the legacy of African Americans is interwoven with 
the fabric of democracy and freedom in the United 
States: Now, therefore, be it
