substances. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Preventing Harmful 
4
Exposure to Phthalates Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds as follows: 
7
(1) Prenatal exposures to phthalates can do 
8
lasting harm to child brain development and increase 
9
children’s risks for learning, attention, and behavior 
10
disorders.

(2) Pregnant women’s exposures to phthalates, 
1
which are known to decrease fetal testosterone, can 
2
harm reproductive tract development in male babies 
3
which may have lifelong consequences. 
4
(3) Phthalates that are used in food production 
5
materials have been shown to leach into food from 
6
plastic equipment, such as tubing used in commer-
7
cial dairy operations, lid gaskets, food preparation 
8
gloves, conveyor belts, and food packaging materials. 
9
(4) Exposure to phthalates can come from mul-
10
tiple sources simultaneously, including food and food 
11
contact substances and other products. Therefore, 
12
assessing risks from individual phthalates may un-
13
derestimate the health risks from exposure to mix-
14
tures of phthalates. 
15
(5) Research shows that women have higher ex-
16
posure to phthalates found in personal care products 
17
than men. 
18
(6) Studies have shown that Black and Latina 
19
women have higher exposure to certain phthalates 
20
compared with White women. 
21
(7) In a nationally representative sample, Black 
22
women had higher exposures to a real-world mixture 
23
of hormonally active phthalates compared to White 
24
women.
