A BILL 
To promote economic growth and recovery throughout the 
Great Lakes region, to restore and to protect America’s 
principal source of fresh water, which holds twenty per-
cent of the world’s freshwater, making it the largest 
system in the world, to foster innovation and to advance 
world-class workforce, education, training, and adjust-
ment institutions for better jobs in the Great Lakes

region, to strengthen and to expand the core U.S. manu-
facturing and industrial base, and the required energy 
systems to sustain and to power production, and to work 
with the Federal Government and provinces of Canada 
on our mutual Great Lakes challenges including the 
Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Seaway, and for other pur-
poses. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Great Lakes Authority 
4
Act of 2022’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) The 8 States that comprise the United 
8
States portion of the Great Lakes watershed contain 
9
the core of America’s commercial and industrial 
10
base. 
11
(2) The Department of Homeland Security de-
12
fines these industries as ‘‘America’s Critical Manu-
13
facturing Sector’’. 
14
(3) The total economy for the United States 
15
Great Lakes region generated $3.1 trillion in gross 
16
domestic product while employing 25.8 million peo-
17
ple and supporting $1.3 trillion in wages. 
18
(4) Maritime commerce supports more than 
19
147,500 jobs in the 8 Great Lakes States and gen-

erates annual binational economic benefits of $35 
1
billion in economic activity ($26 billion in the United 
2
States), $10.5 billion in personal income and local 
3
consumption expenditures in the United States), and 
4
$4.6 billion in Federal, State, and local tax revenue 
5
in the United States. 
6
(5) The Great Lakes region’s 5 Great Lakes— 
7
Erie, Huron, Michigan, Ontario, and Superior—are 
8
the source of 21 percent of the world’s surface fresh 
9
water and 84 percent of North America’s fresh 
10
water, making it the largest freshwater system in 
11
the world. 
12
(6) Since the early 1980s, the inequalities be-
13
tween the few and the many, the coasts and the in-
14
terior, and the developed and underdeveloped regions 
15
of the United States have widened. 
16
(7) The United States has closed 91,000 fac-
17
tories and lost 5 million manufacturing jobs since 
18
NAFTA was enacted in 1993 and since China joined 
19
the World Trade Organization in 2000. The 8-State 
20
Great Lakes region lost 1.5 million of those jobs— 
21
that is, 30 percent. 
22
(8) The losses of factories and jobs, in turn, 
23
have greatly weakened the fiscal capacity of the 
24
Great Lakes region’s State and local governments. A 
25

•HR 7131 IH
measure of this fiscal crisis is found in the high mu-
1
nicipal indebtedness of the region’s cities, as well as 
2
debt burdens due to Federal Government mandates. 
3
(9) When workers’ jobs are outsourced or elimi-
4
nated by increased foreign competition, entire com-
5
munities feel the impact. Communities throughout 
6
the Great Lakes, including communities of color, 
7
have struggled to rebuild the economic conditions 
8
that once supported thriving working and middle 
9
class lives for their residents. 
10
(10) The loss of factories and jobs has hollowed 
11
out entire communities, leading to the spread of 
12
blight, pollution and vacant and abandoned prop-
13
erties that destabilize rural, suburban and urban 
14
communities across the Great Lakes region. 
15
(11) The Great Lakes States have not kept 
16
pace with innovation. Specifically, in 1990, 51,000 
17
United States patents were issued and in 2020 the 
18
United States Patent and Trademark Office granted 
19
188,000—an increase of 265 percent, but not a sin-
20
gle State in the Great Lakes region reached the na-
21
tional average by 2020. 
22
(12) The Great Lakes region faces numerous 
23
ecological threats, including invasive species, toxic 
24
17:12 Mar 29, 2022
H7131
5 
•HR 7131 IH
algae, erosion, development, waste plastics, and toxic 
1
pollutants, among other sources. 
2
(13) Heavy power demands across the region 
3
require a dependable baseload energy supply with a 
4
highly skilled workforce. Today, the region has 17 
5
nuclear reactors at 15 sites in operation. Nuclear 
6
power provides 15 percent of the electricity for Ohio 
7
and Wisconsin, 23 percent for Minnesota, 29 percent 
8
for Michigan, 33 percent for New York, 41 percent 
9
for Pennsylvania, and 53 percent for Illinois; how-
10
ever, competitive pressures from massive, new nat-
11
ural gas supplies have created financial pressures 
12
that can make nuclear power less competitive and 
13
more expensive. 
14
(14) Building back better in the Great Lakes 
15
region is a challenge that requires an empowered 
16
and well-financed Great Lakes Authority. 
17
(15) The Great Lakes Authority can support 
18
sustained growth and innovation through public and 
19
private sector initiatives and collaboration with re-
20
gional stakeholders.
