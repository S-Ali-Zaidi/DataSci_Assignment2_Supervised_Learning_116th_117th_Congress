•HR 8337 IH
retary of Agriculture, shall establish an initiative to evalu-
1
ate terrestrial carbon sequestration and carbon sequestra-
2
tion in geologic formations to— 
3
(1) enhance the scientific understanding of, and 
4
reduce uncertainties associated with, the long- and 
5
short-term behavior and potential environmental ef-
6
fects of sequestered carbon; 
7
(2) inform improved risk-assessment methods, 
8
risk-management practices, and standards with re-
9
spect to the sequestration of carbon on large and 
10
small scales; and 
11
(3) provide reference data needed for the devel-
12
opment and demonstration of new carbon sequestra-
13
tion technologies. 
14
(b) INITIATIVE COMPONENTS.—In carrying out the 
15
initiative under subsection (a), the Secretary of Energy, 
16
in coordination with the Secretary of the Interior and the 
17
Secretary of Agriculture, shall— 
18
(1) identify scientific challenges for widespread 
19
adoption of terrestrial carbon sequestration and car-
20
bon sequestration in geological formations, including 
21
in shallow formations and sites not used for en-
22
hanced oil recovery; 
23
(2) develop, in coordination with relevant Fed-
24
eral agencies’ research efforts, a long-term strategic

and prioritized research agenda to address such sci-
1
entific challenges; and 
2
(3) leverage for the advancement of modeling 
3
and analysis the collective body of knowledge and 
4
data, including experience and resources from exist-
5
ing carbon utilization and sequestration research, 
6
entities, and demonstrations, from— 
7
(A) the United States Geological Survey, 
8
the Agricultural Research Service, and the na-
9
tional Carbon Utilization Research Center; 
10
(B) the Department of Energy, including 
11
the Office of Science; and 
12
(C) other Federal agencies, research com-
13
munities, and users of the reference data re-
14
ferred to in subsection (a)(3), including the Na-
15
tional Institute of Food and Agriculture, the 
16
National Science Foundation, the Forest Serv-
17
ice, and the Natural Resources Conservation 
18
Service. 
19
(c) PRIORITIES.—In carrying out the initiative under 
20
subsection (a), the Secretary of Energy shall prioritize 
21
joint research with relevant Federal agencies, including 
22
the agencies specified in subsection (b)(3)(C), to achieve 
23
the following objectives:

•HR 8337 IH
(1) Increasing the understanding and develop-
1
ment of permanent terrestrial carbon sequestration, 
2
including through organic soil carbon sequestration, 
3
soil carbon mineralization, artificial reforestation, 
4
and carbon mineralization utilizing mine tailings. 
5
(2) Developing computational tools and data 
6
sharing practices to assess and manage potential en-
7
vironmental impacts at geologic formations and ter-
8
restrial carbon storage sites across a variety of eco-
9
systems. 
10
(3) Collecting, identifying, and utilizing data 
11
needed to increase the understanding of terrestrial 
12
carbon sequestration, in particular carbon seques-
13
tered through agricultural practices and conservation 
14
agriculture, such as rangeland and grazing manage-
15
ment, soil cover, and crop rotations. 
16
(4) Advancing the commercialization of new 
17
and existing sequestration technologies or methods. 
18
(d) COORDINATION.—The Secretary of Energy shall 
19
carry out the initiative under subsection (a) with and avoid 
20
unnecessary duplication of the following: 
21
(1) Other research entities of the Department 
22
of Energy, including the National Laboratories and 
23
the Advanced Research Projects Agency—Energy.
