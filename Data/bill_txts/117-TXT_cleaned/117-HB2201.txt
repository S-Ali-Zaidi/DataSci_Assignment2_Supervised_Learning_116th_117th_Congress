SEC. 2. PURPOSES. 
1
The purposes of this Act are— 
2
(1) to create a comprehensive initiative that will 
3
address the need for both computer equipment or 
4
devices and broadband/internet subscriptions to cre-
5
ate equity in marginalized communities, 
6
(2) to address the problem of ensuring that low 
7
and moderate-income school-age children, youth, and 
8
college students have access to computer technology 
9
before, during and after the pandemic, which is both 
10
a national concern and an education and equity 
11
issue, and 
12
(3) to create a $10,000 lifetime tax credit for 
13
computer costs for individuals ($20,000 for joint re-
14
turns) in low and moderate-income communities. 
15
Many individuals, especially students in elementary 
16
schools, are not familiar with completing homework 
17
in a computer environment. This legislation also pro-
18
vides 501(c)3 and 501(c)4 organizations and accred-
19
ited academic institutions with funding to provide 
20
training and technical support in the use of com-
21
puters and associated technology.

SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
23
Congress finds the following: 
24
(1) A PEW Research Center study revealed 
25
that while 58 percent of 8th graders in the United 
26
01:10 May 21, 2021
H2201
3 
•HR 2201 IH
States use a computer to complete homework, low 
1
and moderate-income and minority students use 
2
cellphones, public wi-fi, or are unable to do their 
3
homework. The Pew Research Center study noted 
4
that 35 percent of teens in the United States use a 
5
cell phone, and 12 percent use public wi-fi. Unfortu-
6
nately, 17 percent of teens in the United States are 
7
unable to complete their homework at all, with 25 
8
percent of Black students and students with a 
9
household income of less than $30,000 leading the 
10
digital homework gap. 
11
(2) The Southern Education Foundation re-
12
ported that 15 million to 16 million K–12 public 
13
school students are caught in the digital divide, in-
14
cluding more rural states with 40 to 50 percent of 
15
students in Alabama, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Mis-
16
sissippi are seriously affected. Also, the SEF reports 
17
that Black, Latinx, and Native American students 
18
make up about 55 percent of disconnected students 
19
while representing about 40 percent of total stu-
20
dents. 
21
(3) As of March 2020, the United States Food 
22
and Nutrition Services reported that approximately 
23
37,000,000 people are receiving SNAP benefits. Of 
24
01:10 May 21, 2021
H2201
4 
•HR 2201 IH
the 37,000,000 SNAP participants, 44 percent of 
1
participants were under 18 years old and school age. 
2
(4) The United States Food and Nutrition 
3
Services also reports that 20,000,000 young people 
4
receive free lunch in the nation’s schools. Also, in 
5
the United States, 72,000,000 people under 18 live 
6
in poverty. When linked to the PEW Research Cen-
7
ter data, this data is an indicator of many millions 
8
of low and moderate-income individuals without 
9
computers and internet subscriptions during the 
10
coronavirus pandemic. 
11
(5) The Education Journal reported in 2018 
12
that 1.2 million children are falling behind at school 
13
because they do not have access to an internet con-
14
nection at home. 
15
(6) Many experts agree two issues prevent the 
16
elimination of the digital poverty divide: 
17
(A) access to devices such as computers 
18
and tablets; and 
19
(B) Internet access or internet subscrip-
20
tions. 
21
(7) Pew research provided evidence of the need 
22
for digital literacy, stating in a new analysis that 59 
23
percent of parents with lower incomes who had chil-
24
dren in schools that were remote at the time said 
25
