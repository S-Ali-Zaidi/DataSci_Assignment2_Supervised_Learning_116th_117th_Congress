SEC. 2. PURPOSES. 
4
The purposes of this Act are— 
5
(1) to clarify and strengthen the integration 
6
mandate of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 
7
1990, held by the Supreme Court in Olmstead v. 
8
L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999) in a manner that acceler-
9
ates and improves State compliance; 
10
(2) to ensure that States provide long-term 
11
services and supports to individuals with disabilities 
12
in a manner that allows individuals with disabilities 
13
to live in the most integrated setting, including the 
14
individual’s own home, have maximum control over 
15
their services and supports, and ensure that long- 
16
term services and supports are provided in a manner 
17
that allows individuals with disabilities to lead an 
18
independent life; 
19
(3) to establish a comprehensive State planning 
20
requirement that includes enforceable, measurable 
21
objectives that are designed to transition individuals 
22
with all types of disabilities at all ages out of institu-
23
tions and into the most integrated setting, if they 
24
choose that transition; and 
25
