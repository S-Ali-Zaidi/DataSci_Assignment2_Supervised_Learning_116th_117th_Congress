bers of the 117th Congress who sought to overturn the

2020 Presidential election violated their oath of office 
to uphold the Constitution or the Rules of the House 
of Representatives, and should face sanction, including 
removal from the House of Representatives. 
Whereas nearly 160,000,000 people, or two-thirds of the 
United States voting population, voted in the November 
2020, presidential election, electing President-elect Jo-
seph R. Biden Jr. and Vice President-elect Kamala Har-
ris, with the highest turnout in over 120 years; 
Whereas despite losing the popular vote by more than 
7,000,000 votes, Donald J. Trump, together with Repub-
lican Members of Congress, have commenced a near daily 
assault on the legitimacy of the 2020 election that in-
cludes filing frivolous lawsuits seeking to have election re-
sults invalidated and the outcome overturned, and mak-
ing unsubstantiated claims of systematic election and 
voter fraud; 
Whereas in a politically motivated and last-ditch effort to 
overthrow the election, over 140 Members of Congress, 
led by Representative Mo Brooks of Alabama, Senator 
Josh Hawley of Missouri, and Senator Ted Cruz of 
Texas, have taken unprecedented steps to defy the will of 
the American people who overwhelmingly voted for Presi-
dent-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala 
Harris by voting against the certification of the votes of 
the Electoral College; 
Whereas the decision by Republican Members of Congress to 
join efforts to invalidate votes in Arizona, Georgia, Michi-
gan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin suppresses the votes of 
millions of people, including Black, Brown, and Indige-
nous people who turned out in historic numbers to deliver

this victory to President-elect Joe Biden and Vice Presi-
dent-elect Kamala Harris; 
Whereas turnout of Black, Brown, and Indigenous voters was 
astounding considering the extraordinary COVID–19 
pandemic that has stunted organizing in communities 
across the country, along with exhaustive delays in poll 
centers, mass closure of polling precincts in predomi-
nantly Black, Brown, and Indigenous communities, and 
deliberate efforts to discount mail-in ballots and spread 
misinformation on vote by mail; 
Whereas refusing to concede the outcome of the 2020 Presi-
dential election and raising baseless allegations of fraud 
in States in which Black, Brown, and Indigenous people 
have been instrumental to the election outcome suggests 
racial animus and a continuation of efforts by Republican 
Members of Congress to disenfranchise Black, Brown, 
and Indigenous voters; 
Whereas senseless attacks on the results of the 2020 Presi-
dential election that seek to question the credibility of 
and will of Black, Brown, and Indigenous voters betrays 
the text and spirit of the Constitution of the United 
States, which each Member swears to support and de-
fend, and violates the Rules of the House of Representa-
tives, which explicitly forbid Members from committing 
unbecoming acts that reflect poorly on our chamber; 
Whereas section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Con-
stitution posits that no individual can serve in the House 
of Representatives who has engaged in disloyalty or sedi-
tion against the United States, stating, ‘‘No person shall 
be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of 
President and Vice President, or hold any office, civil or 
military, under the United States, or under any state,

who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of 
Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a 
member of any state legislature, or as an executive or ju-
dicial officer of any state, to support the Constitution of 
the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or 
rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the 
enemies thereof.’’; 
Whereas clause 1 of rule XXIII of the Rules of the House 
of Representatives states, ‘‘A Member, Delegate, Resi-
dent Commissioner, officer, or employee of the House 
shall behave at all times in a manner that shall reflect 
creditably on the House.’’; 
Whereas each Member of the House of Representatives must 
be dedicated to the United States, the Constitution of the 
United States, the Rules of the House of Representatives, 
and upholding the oath of office; 
Whereas efforts by Republican Members of Congress to de-
nounce the votes of millions of Americans is a continu-
ation of Jim-Crow era measures to suppress Black, 
Brown, and Indigenous voters; 
Whereas House Republicans have refused to vote in support 
of voter protections aimed at supporting disenfranchised 
Black, Brown, and Indigenous voters, including H.R. 1, 
the For the People Act and H.R. 4, the John Lewis Vot-
ing Rights Advancement Act, in the 116th Congress, and 
the Republican Senate majority has been a legislative 
graveyard for these critical efforts to empower and ex-
pand voting rights for the American people; 
Whereas the House must rebuke the relentless assault on 
foundational democratic principles at the heart of our 
representative democracy and implement measures to

protect the will of American voters by abolishing the elec-
toral college, providing resources and funding for poll 
centers in predominantly Black, Brown, and Indigenous 
communities, restoring key pieces to protect voters that 
were gutted in the Shelby v. Holder Supreme Court deci-
sion, and overturning Federal felony disenfranchisement 
laws; and 
Whereas efforts by Members of Congress, regardless of party, 
that seek to undermine our democracy, disenfranchise 
Black, Brown, and Indigenous voters, erode faith in the 
Federal Government, and attack the popular will of the 
American public without merit must be condemned, and 
those Members should be held accountable for their ac-
tions: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That—
