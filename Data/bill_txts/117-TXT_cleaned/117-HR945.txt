RESOLUTION 
Condemning Members of the Russian Duma and Federation 
Council who voted to recognize the independence of 
Donetsk and Luhansk in flagrant violation of Ukraine’s 
sovereignty and territorial integrity, international law, 
and Russia’s commitments under the 2015 Minsk agree-
ment. 
Whereas, since Russia’s illegal invasion and subsequent an-
nexation of the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine in 2014, 
Russia has engineered the rise of new separatist move-
ments in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of eastern 
Ukraine, collectively known as the Donbas;

Whereas the 2014 and 2015 Minsk agreements, designed to 
end the war in the Donbas region, established a cease- 
fire and provided a ‘‘special status’’ for the Donbas re-
gion that would enable it to enjoy limited autonomy while 
under continued control of the government of Ukraine; 
Whereas, on February 15, 2022, Russia’s State Duma, the 
lower house of parliament, voted 351 to 16 to adopt a 
resolution calling for the diplomatic recognition of the so- 
called Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) and the 
Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR), self-proclaimed break-
away regions in the Donbas; 
Whereas Russian President Vladimir Putin has issued base-
less claims of ‘‘genocide’’ by the Ukrainian military 
against the population in the Donbas and local authori-
ties ordered women and children to evacuate, marking a 
clear prelude to a Russian invasion; 
Whereas, on February 21, 2022, President Putin signed de-
crees recognizing the DPR and LPR and ordered the 
Russian military to conduct ‘‘peacekeeping operations’’ in 
the territories, marking a dangerous military escalation 
and a blatant violation of the Minsk agreements and 
international law; 
Whereas, on February 22, 2022, the Duma voted 398 to 0 
and the Federation Council, Russia’s upper house of par-
liament, voted 154 to 0 to recognize the DPR and LPR 
and grant President Putin consent to use military force 
in the Donbas region; and 
Whereas, on the same day, Russian tanks and troops moved 
into Donetsk and Luhansk in what the White House de-
scribed as an ‘‘invasion’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
