A BILL 
To expedite the provision of humanitarian assistance, includ-
ing life-saving medical care, to the people of North 
Korea, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Enhancing North 
4
Korea Humanitarian Assistance Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress makes the following findings: 
7
03:35 Apr 17, 2021
H1504
2 
•HR 1504 IH
(1) Providing humanitarian assistance, includ-
1
ing to countries subject to sanctions imposed by the 
2
United States, is an expression of American values 
3
that furthers United States interests around the 
4
world and is consistent with international humani-
5
tarian law. 
6
(2) As of February 2020, roughly 10,100,000 
7
people in North Korea are in urgent need of food as-
8
sistance and roughly 10,400,000 need nutrition sup-
9
port and improved access to basic services, including 
10
health care, water, sanitation, and hygiene facilities. 
11
(3) More than 40 percent of people in North 
12
Korea are undernourished, and 1 in 5 children in 
13
the country under the age of 5 is stunted in growth. 
14
(4) More than 1⁄3 of household drinking water 
15
in North Korea is contaminated. 
16
(5) Independent experts have identified severe 
17
deficiencies in North Korea’s public health infra-
18
structure, trained medical personnel, ability to com-
19
municate important safety information, and commit-
20
ment to addressing those deficiencies. 
21
(6) North Korea has one of the highest burdens 
22
of tuberculosis in the world and humanitarian assist-
23
ance is critical for countering the spread of deadly 
24
infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, 
25
03:35 Apr 17, 2021
H1504
3 
•HR 1504 IH
Hepatitis B, and the coronavirus disease 2019 (com-
1
monly known as ‘‘COVID–19’’). 
2
(7) North Korea cannot reliably maintain 
3
stocks of drugs to treat diseases such as tuberculosis 
4
and HIV/AIDS, posing the risk of interrupted treat-
5
ments, which can lead to treatment failures and de-
6
velopment of resistance to multiple therapies, mak-
7
ing treatment significantly more difficult and costly. 
8
(8) The spread of COVID–19 in North Korea 
9
is likely having devastating consequences for the 
10
people of that country who are especially vulnerable 
11
to a pandemic because of deficiencies in public 
12
health infrastructure. 
13
(9) The 2019 Global Health Security Index 
14
shows North Korea is the third least prepared coun-
15
try in the world to combat a health security crisis. 
16
(10) While the Government of North Korea has 
17
not reported any cases of COVID–19 in the country, 
18
the true extent and results of testing are unknown, 
19
and government officials have not historically been 
20
open or transparent about humanitarian emergencies 
21
facing the people of North Korea. 
22
(11) Responses to the COVID–19 crisis, includ-
23
ing border closings and quarantines have caused eco-
24
nomic shock and hampered international efforts that 
25
03:35 Apr 17, 2021
H1504
4 
•HR 1504 IH
would otherwise be providing life-saving support to 
1
the people of North Korea. 
2
(12) In its final report published on February 
3
7, 2020, the United Nations Panel of Experts on 
4
North Korea found that ‘‘United Nations agencies 
5
and humanitarian organizations continue to experi-
6
ence unintended consequences on their humanitarian 
7
programmes that make it impossible to operate nor-
8
mally in the Democratic People’s Republic of 
9
Korea.’’. 
10
(13) Barriers to humanitarian access can result 
11
from decisions made or delayed by the Government 
12
of North Korea, by the governments of other coun-
13
tries, including the governments of the United 
14
States and the People’s Republic of China, and by 
15
the Committee of the United Nations Security Coun-
16
cil established by United Nations Security Council 
17
Resolution 1718 (2006) (in this Act referred to as 
18
the ‘‘1718 Sanctions Committee’’). 
19
(14) Nongovernmental organizations that pro-
20
vide humanitarian assistance in North Korea must 
21
typically seek simultaneous authorizations from the 
22
Department of the Treasury, the Department of 
23
State, the Department of Commerce, the 1718 Sanc-
24
tions Committee, customs officials in the People’s 
25
03:35 Apr 17, 2021
H1504

•HR 1504 IH
Republic of China, and the Government of North 
1
Korea, adding further delays to humanitarian ac-
2
cess. 
3
(15) The 1718 Sanctions Committee issued the 
4
document entitled ‘‘Implementation Assistance No-
5
tice No. 7’’ on August 6, 2018, to clarify the process 
6
for granting requests for humanitarian exemptions 
7
by the United Nations and to reaffirm that sanc-
8
tions are not intended to have adverse humanitarian 
9
consequences for civilians in North Korea, and this 
10
guidance was updated on December 1, 2020 to help 
11
streamline permissions for COVID–19-related aid 
12
and to extend humanitarian waivers from six to nine 
13
months. 
14
(16) United States Government travel restric-
15
tions impede the access of United States employees 
16
of humanitarian organizations inside North Korea 
17
and can complicate the monitoring and evaluation 
18
procedures that nongovernmental organizations have 
19
used to ensure that aid reaches the most vulnerable 
20
populations. 
21
(17) Humanitarian exceptions in comprehensive 
22
sanctions programs, such as the exceptions under 
23
section 510.512 of the North Korea Sanctions Regu-
24
lations, are not effective unless the persons who pro-
25
03:35 Apr 17, 2021
H1504

•HR 1504 IH
vide assistance along with their financial institu-
1
tions, suppliers, shippers, and other entities can 
2
make practical use of the exceptions. 
3
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
4
It is the sense of Congress that— 
5
(1) the interagency review mandated by the 
6
President’s January 21, 2021 National Security 
7
Memorandum 1, offers an opportunity to make ap-
8
propriate adjustments to United States and multilat-
9
eral sanctions to ensure that such sanctions do not 
10
inadvertently hinder humanitarian access to the peo-
11
ple of North Korea; 
12
(2) national governments and multilateral au-
13
thorities must take action to mitigate documented 
14
delays and ensure that sanctions imposed with re-
15
spect to North Korea do not hinder efforts to pro-
16
vide humanitarian relief, including life-saving med-
17
ical care to combat COVID–19, to the people of 
18
North Korea; 
19
(3) the Department of the Treasury should pro-
20
vide timely and meaningful responses to requests for 
21
specific licenses given that humanitarian organiza-
22
tions typically have a limited time to execute 
23
projects that must be approved by multiple United 
24
03:35 Apr 17, 2021
H1504
7 
•HR 1504 IH
States Government agencies and foreign govern-
1
ments; 
2
(4) because humanitarian assistance is unlikely 
3
to enable large-scale sanctions evasion and revenue 
4
generation, sanctions enforcement should focus on 
5
ongoing North Korean activities, including ship-to- 
6
ship transfers of coal and other goods, cyberattacks, 
7
and the use of forced labor abroad, all highlighted 
8
in reports issued by the United Nations Panel of Ex-
9
perts on North Korea and other authoritative 
10
sources; 
11
(5) financial institutions should recognize and 
12
consider the reputational and practical costs of im-
13
peding legitimate efforts to deliver life-saving aid to 
14
North Korea; and 
15
(6) the Department of State’s travel ban for 
16
humanitarian missions to North Korea is incon-
17
sistent with the intent of the North Korea Sanctions 
18
and Policy Enhancement Act of 2016 (Public Law 
19
114–122), which explicitly exempts work related to 
20
the repatriation of United States veterans’ remains.
