SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Bullying and harassment foster a climate of 
3
fear and disrespect that can seriously impair the 
4
physical and psychological health of its victims and 
5
create conditions that negatively affect learning, 
6
thereby undermining the ability of students to 
7
achieve their full potential. 
8
(2) Bullying and harassment contribute to high 
9
dropout rates, increased absenteeism, and academic 
10
underachievement. 
11
(3) Bullying and harassment include a range of 
12
behaviors that negatively impact a student’s ability 
13
to learn and participate in educational opportunities 
14
and activities that schools offer. Such behaviors can 
15
include hitting or punching, name-calling, intimida-
16
tion through gestures or social exclusion, and send-
17
ing insulting or offensive messages through elec-
18
tronic communications, such as internet sites, e- 
19
mail, instant messaging, mobile phones and mes-
20
saging, telephone, or any other means. 
21
(4) Schools with enumerated anti-bullying and 
22
harassment policies have an increased level of re-
23
porting and teacher intervention in incidents of bul-
24
lying and harassment, thereby reducing the overall 
25
frequency and number of such incidents.

•HR 4332 IH
(5) Students have been particularly singled out 
1
for bullying and harassment on the basis of their ac-
2
tual or perceived race, color, national origin, sex, 
3
disability status, sexual orientation, gender identity, 
4
or religion, among other categories. 
5
(6) Some young people experience a form of 
6
bullying called relational aggression or psychological 
7
bullying, which harms individuals by damaging, 
8
threatening, or manipulating their relationships with 
9
their peers, or by injuring their feelings of social ac-
10
ceptance. 
11
(7) Interventions to address bullying and har-
12
assment should incorporate evidence-based discipline 
13
policies and practices, such as Positive Behavior 
14
Interventions and Supports (PBIS) and other re-
15
storative practices that can minimize suspensions, 
16
expulsions, and other exclusionary and harmful dis-
17
cipline policies to ensure that students are not 
18
‘‘pushed-out’’ or diverted to the juvenile justice sys-
19
tem. 
20
(8) Perpetrators of bullying and harassment 
21
often have a history of trauma or psychological dis-
22
tress, or have been bullied themselves. These stu-
23
dents, often discussed as ‘‘bully-victims’’, require ad-
