A BILL 
To amend the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to clarify

ing systems used in elections for Federal office shall 
be used as the official ballots for purposes of audits 
and recounts conducted with respect to such elections, 
to prohibit the connection of such systems to the inter-
net, to require States to remove individuals who are 
ineligible to vote in elections for Federal office in the 
State from the Statewide voter registration list, and for
