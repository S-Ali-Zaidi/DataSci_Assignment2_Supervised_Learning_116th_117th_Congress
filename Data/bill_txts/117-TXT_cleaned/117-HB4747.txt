SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) The success of United States foreign policy 
8
depends on the ability to accurately perceive and un-

•HR 4747 IH
derstand other countries’ foreign and domestic poli-
1
cies. 
2
(2) Open source materials published by the 
3
People’s Republic of China and other nations offer 
4
a uniquely valuable window into the politics, policy, 
5
ideology, intentions, and activities of those countries. 
6
(3) A lack of foreign language speakers greatly 
7
hinders United States policymakers, journalists, aca-
8
demics, students, and others’ ability to understand 
9
the People’s Republic of China and other nations 
10
and governments. 
11
(4) During the Cold War, the Foreign Broad-
12
cast Information Service provided translations and 
13
open source analysis that nourished generations of 
14
diplomats, journalists, academics, students, and oth-
15
ers. 
16
(5) Today, a public translation and analysis or-
17
ganization is needed to support the development of 
18
United States foreign policy and to enrich public un-
19
derstanding. 
20
SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT. 
21
There is established a federally funded research and 
22
development center to be known as the ‘‘Open Translation 
23
and Analysis Center’’ (referred to in this section as 
24
‘‘OTAC’’).
