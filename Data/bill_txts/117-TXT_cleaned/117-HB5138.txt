Congress finds that—

7
recent SolarWinds breach and the growing spate of 
8
ransomware attacks on critical infrastructure enti-
9
ties and State and local governments; 
10
(2) the Federal Government is facing a short-
11
age of qualified cybersecurity personnel, as noted in 
12
a March 2019 Government Accountability Office re-
13
port on critical staffing needs in the Federal cyber-
14
security workforce; 
15
(3) there is a national shortage of qualified cy-
16
bersecurity personnel, and according to CyberSeek, a 
17
project supported by the National Initiative for Cy-
18
bersecurity Education within the National Institute 
19
of Standards and Technology, there are approxi-
20
mately 500,000 cybersecurity job openings around 
21
the United States; 
22
(4) in May 2021, the Department of Homeland 
23
Security announced that the Department was initi-
24
ating a 60-day sprint to hire 200 cybersecurity per-
25
sonnel across the Department, with 100 of those

(5) the Federal Government needs to— 
4
(A) expand the cybersecurity workforce 
5
pipeline 
of 
the 
Federal 
Government 
to 
6
sustainably close a Federal cybersecurity work-
7
force shortage; and 
8
(B) work cooperatively with the private

sector and State and local government authori-
10
