A BILL 
To recognize the right of the People of Puerto Rico to 
call a status convention through which the people would 
exercise their natural right to self-determination, and 
to establish a mechanism for congressional consideration 
of such decision, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Puerto Rico Self-De-
4
termination Act of 2021’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds as follows: 
7
(1) In 1898, the United States defeated the 
8
Spanish Kingdom in the Spanish-American War and 
9
acquired by conquest Puerto Rico, Guam, and the 
10
Philippines pursuant to the Treaty of Paris. 
11
(2) In 1900, Congress established a civilian 
12
government on the island through the Foraker Act. 
13
Among other points, that Act established an ‘‘execu-
14
tive council’’ consisting of various department heads 
15
and a presidentially appointed civilian governor. 
16
(3) The Foraker Act also established the Resi-
17
dent Commissioner position to represent island in-
18
terests in Congress. These duties came to include 
19
nonvoting service in the House of Representatives.

(4) In 1901, the Supreme Court’s decisions in 
1
Downes v. Bidwell and its progeny held that for pur-
2
poses of the Constitution’s Uniformity Clause, Puer-
3
to Rico was not part of the United States and sub-
4
ject to the plenary powers of Congress, which in 
5
turn established a colonial relationship. Justice 
6
White, in concurrence, opined that Congress has dis-
7
cretion to decide whether and when to incorporate a 
8
territory into the United States. 
9
(5) Congress recognized Puerto Rico’s authority 
10
over matters of internal governance in 1950 with the 
11
passage of the Puerto Rico Federal Relations Act of 
12
1950 (Public Law 81–600), providing for a constitu-
13
tional government for the island which was adopted 
14
by Congress as a compact for the people of Puerto 
15
Rico and the subsequent ratification of the island’s 
16
constitution in July 1952. 
17
(6) On November 18, 1953, the United Nations 
18
recognized Puerto Rico as a self-governing political 
19
entity under the United Nations General Assembly 
20
Resolution 748. 
21
(7) The political status of Puerto Rico is of sig-
22
nificant interest to communities both on and off the 
23
island, including diaspora groups that continue hav-
24

ing strong cultural ties and socioeconomic ties to 
1
Puerto Rico. 
2
(8) The United States has a legal duty to com-
3
ply with Article 1 of the International Covenant on 
4
Civil and Political Rights, which establishes that all 
5
peoples have the right to self-determination and ‘‘by 
6
virtue of that right they freely determine their polit-
7
ical status and freely pursue their economic, social 
8
and cultural development’’. 
9
(9) The status convention provides a delibera-
10
tive, comprehensive, and uninterrupted space of dia-
11
logue that can define the future of Puerto Rico. 
12
