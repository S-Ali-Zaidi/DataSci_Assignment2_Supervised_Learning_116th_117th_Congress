SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) In 1866, Congress passed the Army Organi-
3
zation Act which authorized the creation of six all- 
4
Black cavalry and infantry regiments. These regi-
5
ments remained active until the Army was deseg-
6
regated in 1951. 
7
(2) According to legend, American Indians 
8
called the Black cavalry troops ‘‘Buffalo Soldiers’’ 
9
because of their dark, curly hair, which resembled a 
10
buffalo’s coat. 
11
(3) The African-American troops accepted the 
12
name with pride and honor, as they were aware of 
13
the buffalo’s fierce bravery and fighting spirit. 
14
(4) The original six regiments melded into the 
15
following four regiments: 
16
(A) The 9th Cavalry Regiment assembled 
17
in New Orleans, Louisiana in August and Sep-
18
tember of 1866. They were ordered to San An-
19
tonio, Texas in April, 1867, with the mission to 
20
maintain order and to secure the road from San 
21
Antonia to El Paso. 
22
(B) The 10th Cavalry Regiment gathered 
23
in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas during the sum-
24
mer of 1867. In August, 1867, they were or-
25

dered to Fort Riley, Kansas with the mission of 
1
protecting the Pacific Railroad. 
2
(C) The 24th Infantry Regiment was orga-
3
nized in 1869, forming from the 38th and 41st 
4
Colored 
Infantry 
Regiments. 
They 
served 
5
throughout the Western United States, with the 
6
mission to protect frontier posts and secure 
7
roadways. 
8
(D) The 25th Infantry Regiment assem-
9
bled at Camp William Penn, Pennsylvania be-
10
ginning in January 1864. They were assigned 
11
to numerous districts within the Department of 
12
the Gulf with the mission to maintain security. 
13
(5) Buffalo Soldiers also assisted in the protec-
14
tion of National Parks. They helped fight wildfires 
15
and poachers in the Yosemite and Sequoia National 
16
Parks and served as park rangers in the Sierra Ne-
17
vada. 
18
(6) In the Spanish American War, all four regi-
19
ments played key roles and fought with distinction, 
20
despite facing severe discrimination from the locals. 
21
(7) At the start of World War I, the Buffalo 
22
Soldier regiments were dispatched to locations 
23
throughout central United States and into the Pa-
24

cific, offering logistics and support behind the front 
1
lines in the American Expeditionary Forces. 
2
(8) During World War II, African-American 
3
soldiers and units continued to serve proudly under 
4
the name ‘‘Buffalo Soldier’’, including the 92nd In-
5
fantry Division, which was the only Black division 
6
that saw combat in Europe. 
7
(9) In the Korean War, Buffalo Soldier regi-
8
ments fought throughout the Korean peninsula, 
9
from the defense of the ‘‘Pusan Perimeter’’ to the 
10
counteroffensives which resulted in the end of armed 
11
hostilities and the creation of the Demilitarized 
12
Zone. 
13
(10) Buffalo Soldiers had the lowest military 
14
desertion and court-martial rates of their time. In 
15
recognition of combat valor and their actions beyond 
16
the call of duty, many were awarded the Congres-
17
sional Medal of Honor. 
18
(11) The Congressional Gold Medal would be 
19
an appropriate way to shed further light on the serv-
20
ice of the Buffalo Soldiers and the instrumental role 
21
they played in instilling an approach to inclusivity 
22
within our military and the American way of life.
