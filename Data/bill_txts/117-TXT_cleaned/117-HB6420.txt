Congress finds the following:

•HR 6420 IH
(1) It has been the longstanding position of the 
1
United States to reduce the demand for sex traf-
2
ficking victims. There is also a wide international 
3
consensus on the necessity of demand reduction in 
4
order to prevent human trafficking. 
5
(2) The United Nations Protocol to Prevent, 
6
Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Espe-
7
cially Women and Children, Supplementing the 
8
United Nations Convention Against Transnational 
9
Organized Crime of 2000 (also referred to as the 
10
‘‘Palermo Protocol(s)’’) expressly addresses the re-
11
quirement that nations make serious efforts to re-
12
duce demand for trafficked persons. 
13
(3) Article 9, addressing prevention of human 
14
trafficking, specifically directs that, ‘‘States Parties 
15
shall adopt or strengthen legislative or other meas-
16
ures, such as educational, social or cultural meas-
17
ures, including through bilateral and multilateral co-
18
operation, to discourage the demand that fosters all 
19
forms of exploitation of persons, especially women 
20
and children, that leads to trafficking.’’. 
21
(4) The United Nations Protocol, the Europe 
22
Convention on Action against Human Trafficking, 
23
and the 2011 European Union Directive of the Eu-
24
ropean Parliament and the Council on preventing

•HR 6420 IH
and combating trafficking in human beings also spe-
1
cifically address the need to prevent human traf-
2
ficking by reducing demand for trafficking victims. 
3
(5) Research has shown that legal prostitution 
4
increases the demand for prostituted persons and 
5
thus increases the market for sex. As a result, there 
6
is a significant increase in instances of human traf-
7
ficking. 
8
(6) In 2012, researchers Seo-Young Cho, Axel 
9
Dreher, and Eric Neumayer published their findings 
10
in World Development establishing that, ‘‘The scale 
11
effect of legalized prostitution leads to an expansion 
12
of the prostitution market, increasing human traf-
13
ficking . . . . On average, countries where prostitu-
14
tion is legal experience larger reported human traf-
15
ficking inflows.’’. 
16
(7) In 2005, a study focused on 11 European 
17
Union countries requested by the European Par-
18
liament’s Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender 
19
Equality and performed by Transcrime found that 
20
stricter prostitution laws are correlated with fewer 
21
human trafficking victims. 
22
(8) Case studies published by researchers 
23
Niklas Jakobsson and Andreas Kotsadam support 
24
the possibility of a causal link between harsher pros-

titution laws and reduced human trafficking. 
1
Jakobsson and Kotsadam found that trafficking of 
2
persons for commercial sexual exploitation is least 
3
prevalent in countries where prostitution is illegal 
4
and most prevalent in countries where prostitution is 
5
legalized. 
6
(9) Further data have demonstrated the cor-
7
relation between the adoption of legislation that 
8
criminalizes demand and reductions in sex traf-
9
ficking.
