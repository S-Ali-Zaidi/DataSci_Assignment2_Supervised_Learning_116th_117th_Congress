SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) A large-scale withdrawal of United States 
3
Armed Forces from Afghanistan will pose a risk to 
4
those who are the most vulnerable in Afghanistan, 
5
especially women and girls. 
6
(2) When the Taliban governed Afghanistan 
7
from 1996 to 2001, it barred women and girls from 
8
taking most jobs or going to school and practically 
9
made them prisoners in their own homes based on 
10
its extremist religious ideology. Further, the Taliban 
11
brutally imposed social restrictions on women, such 
12
as mandatory burqa coverings, and restricted their 
13
access to health care. The Taliban also prohibited 
14
women from appearing in public spaces without a 
15
male chaperone and imposed extremely violent pun-
16
ishments, often publicly, upon women for breaking 
17
its decrees. 
18
(3) The women of Afghanistan have achieved 
19
much since the fall of the Taliban government, even 
20
as insecurity, underdevelopment, and patriarchal 
21
norms continue to limit their rights and opportuni-
22
ties in much of Afghanistan. 
23
(4) Through strong support from the United 
24
States and the international community—

(A) female enrollment in public schools in 
1
Afghanistan has risen from zero in 2001 to 
2
more than 3,000,000 in 2010; and 
3
(B) as of 2019— 
4
(i) millions of women in Afghanistan 
5
have voted, and 25 percent of parliamen-
6
tarians in Afghanistan are women; 
7
(ii) women held 13 seats as ministers 
8
and deputy ministers and 4 women served 
9
as ambassadors; and 
10
(iii) 
beyond 
government, 
women 
11
served as university instructors and profes-
12
sors, judges, prosecutors, defense attor-
13
neys, police and army personnel, health 
14
professionals, 
journalists, 
and 
entre-
15
preneurs. 
16
(5) Women’s empowerment continues to serve 
17
United States primary interests in Afghanistan be-
18
cause women are sources of both peace and eco-
19
nomic progress in the country. 
20
(6) If the United States military withdraws and 
21
the Taliban regains influence, the United States will 
22
have little ability to preserve the rights of women 
23
and girls in Afghanistan, and there is fear that

those women and girls will again be vulnerable to in-
1
timidation and marginalization. 
2
SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
3
It is the sense of Congress that— 
4
(1) since 2001, Afghan civil society has 
5
emerged as an important engine of social and polit-
6
ical development; 
7
(2) any future political order in Afghanistan 
8
should not only secure the gains made in democratic, 
9
political, human, and women’s rights, but also work 
10
to increase the ability of women to be treated equally 
11
throughout society because respecting rights is es-
12
sential to securing a lasting peace and reflects the 
13
will of the Afghan people; 
14
(3) the United States must endeavor to pre-
15
serve the hard-won gains of the past 2 decades, par-
16
ticularly as related to the role and protection of 
17
women and girls in civil society; and 
18
(4) long-term stability in Afghanistan can best 
19
be achieved and maintained by an inclusive Afghan 
20
government that is responsive to the needs of all its 
21
diverse communities and respects the rights of all its 
22
citizens, especially women.

SEC. 5. POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES REGARDING THE 
1
RIGHTS OF WOMEN AND GIRLS OF AFGHANI-
2
STAN. 
3
It is the policy of the United States— 
4
(1) to continue to support the rights of women 
5
and girls in Afghan civil society after the withdrawal 
6
of the Armed Forces of the United States from Af-
7
ghanistan; 
8
(2) to strongly oppose any return to political ar-
9
rangements that would significantly weaken the 
10
rights of women in Afghanistan; 
11
(3) to refuse to provide economic aid to an Af-
12
ghan government (whether including or controlled by 
13
the Taliban) if such government does not maintain 
14
minimal standards, statutory or otherwise, of wom-
15
en’s rights, such as by denying women access to 
16
health care and primary and secondary education, 
17
prohibiting women from appearing outside of a 
18
household without a male relative, or disqualifying 
19
women from jobs on the basis of gender; 
20
(4) to instruct, as appropriate, representatives 
21
of the United States Government to use the voice, 
22
aid, and influence of the United States directly with 
23
the Government of Afghanistan and the Taliban, 
24
and at the United Nations, to preserve the civil and

stan; 
2
(5) to continue providing the United States aid 
3
and assistance necessary to preserve the rights of 
4
women and girls in Afghanistan so that they may 
5
continue to pursue educational and professional op-
6
portunities and be equal members of Afghan civil so-
7
ciety; and 
8
(6) to identify individuals who violate the basic 
9
rights of women in Afghanistan, as those rights are 
10
defined by the Constitution of Afghanistan or set by 
11
minimal international human right standards, such 
12
as by committing murder, lynching, and grievous do-
13
mestic violence against women, and to ensure those 
14
individuals are brought to justice, prosecuted, and 
15
imprisoned.
