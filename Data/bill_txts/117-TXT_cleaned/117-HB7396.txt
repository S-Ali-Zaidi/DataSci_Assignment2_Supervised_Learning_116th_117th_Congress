(1) FINDINGS AND POLICY.—Section 1 of the

National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 151) is 
7
amended by adding at the end the following: 
8
‘‘International trade is one of the most important 
9
components of the economy of the United States and will 
10
likely continue to grow in the future. In order to remain 
11
competitive in an increasingly competitive global economy, 
12
it is essential that the United States possess a highly effi-
13
cient and reliable public and private transportation net-
14
work. The ports of the United States are an increasingly 
15
important part of such transportation network. Experi-
16
ence has demonstrated that frequent and periodic disrup-
17
tions to commerce in the maritime industry in the form 
18
of deliberate and unprotected labor slowdowns, or impedi-
19
ments to modernization, at the ports of the United States 
20
have led to substantial supply chain and economic disrup-
21
tions, interfering with the free flow of domestic and inter-
22
national commerce and threatening the economic health 
23
of the United States, as well as its citizens and businesses. 
24
Such frequent and periodic disruptions to commerce in the 
25
maritime industry hurt the reputation of the United

States in the global economy, cause the ports of the

United States to lose business, and represent a serious 
2
and burgeoning threat to the financial health and eco-

nomic stability of the United States. It is hereby declared 
4
to be the policy of the United States to eliminate the 
5
causes and mitigate the effects of such disruptions to com-
6
merce in the maritime industry and to provide effective 
7
and prompt remedies to individuals injured by such dis-
8
ruptions.’’.
