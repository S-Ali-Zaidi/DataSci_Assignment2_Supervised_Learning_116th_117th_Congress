A BILL 
To direct the Secretary of Transportation to establish a 
Wireless Electric Vehicle Charging Grant Program, and 
for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Wireless Electric Vehi-

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 6546 IH
(1) Electric vehicles are crucial to cutting 
1
greenhouse gas emissions, reducing reliance on fossil 
2
fuels, and combating the climate crisis. As of 2019, 
3
the transportation sector accounts for 29 percent of 
4
all greenhouse gas emissions, which is the most of 
5
any sector. 
6
(2) Increasing the adoption of electric vehicles 
7
will reduce pollution and increase air quality for 
8
communities located near roads with high traffic 
9
density or high-volume routes. 
10
(3) As the automotive industry shifts towards 
11
electric vehicles, investing in new electric vehicle 
12
technologies will be crucial to enhancing America’s 
13
competitiveness, creating jobs, and ensuring contin-
14
ued economic growth. 
15
(4) Range anxiety is one of the chief barriers 
16
to electric vehicle adoption. If deployed strategically, 
17
wireless electric vehicle charging could help by pro-
18
viding drivers convenient opportunities to charge and 
19
extend the range of electric vehicles. 
20
(5) Wireless charging technologies could be in-
21
valuable for electric transit buses, trucking, fleet ve-
22
hicles, and autonomous electric vehicles, allowing for 
23
convenient and hands-free charging, while also low-

ering costs, as effective wireless charging would re-
1
duce the need for larger and heavier batteries. 
2
(6) Wireless electric vehicle charging has the 
3
potential to make electric vehicles more accessible 
4
and allow all people of the United States, regardless 
5
of physical ability, to enjoy the benefits of electric 
6
vehicles. 
7
(7) It is critical to establish a resilient and ro-
8
bust domestic supply chain for all electric vehicle 
9
charging infrastructure. With strong Buy America 
10
requirements, 
federally 
funded 
programs 
can 
11
incentivize companies to build facilities in the United 
12
States, creating good paying jobs and economic 
13
growth for communities.

SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF WIRELESS ELECTRIC VEHICLE 
15
CHARGING GRANT PROGRAM. 
16
The Secretary of Transportation shall establish a 
17
program, in coordination with the Department of Energy, 
18
to award grants on a competitive basis to eligible entities 
19
for projects to construct, install, or improve existing wire-
20
less charging infrastructure and technology for electric ve-
21
hicles. The program shall be known as the Wireless Elec-
22
tric Vehicle Charging Grant Program (in this Act referred 
23
to as the ‘‘Program’’).
