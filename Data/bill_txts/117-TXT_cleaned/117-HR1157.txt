RESOLUTION 
Supporting the designation of June 6, 2022, as ‘‘CASA/ 
GAL Volunteers’ Day’’. 
Whereas Court Appointed Special Advocate (referred to this 
preamble as ‘‘CASA’’) and Guardian ad Litem (referred 
to in this preamble as ‘‘GAL’’) volunteers advocate na-
tionwide for the best interests of children before courts 
in cases with allegations of abuse or neglect; 
Whereas the CASA/GAL Program provides best interest ad-
vocacy for children reflected in guiding principles which 
recognize the importance of family preservation and re-
unification, equity, diversity, inclusion, and collaboration;

Whereas more than 216,000 children in the United States 
enter the foster care system, through no fault of their 
own, due to allegations of abuse or neglect and rely on 
adults to advocate on their behalf; 
Whereas CASA and GAL volunteers, appointed by a judge— 
(1) provide the court with the comprehensive and ob-
jective information the court needs to make the most 
well-informed decisions and help ensure positive outcomes 
for children, youth, and families; and 
(2) take time to build meaningful and authentic re-
lationships with such children, youth, and families; 
Whereas research shows that when a CASA or GAL volun-
teer is assigned to a case, outcomes are strengthened for 
children and families, a higher number of services are or-
dered, and children are significantly less likely to reenter 
the child welfare system, perform better academically and 
behaviorally, and have higher levels of hope; 
Whereas, in January 1974, Congress enacted the Child Abuse 
Prevention Treatment Act (42 U.S.C. 5101 et seq.); 
Whereas the Child Abuse Prevention Treatment Act provides 
financial assistance to States for the prevention and 
treatment of child abuse and neglect and includes a re-
quirement that in every case a GAL is appointed to rep-
resent the best interest of the child; 
Whereas such GAL requirement was subsequently amended 
to provide that the GAL may be an attorney or a court- 
appointed special advocate; 
Whereas today, CASA and GAL volunteers span 49 States 
and the District of Columbia, including 950 State organi-
zations and local programs, and more than 94,000 volun-

teers offer their services to nearly 250,000 children, 
youth, and families; and 
Whereas 2022 marks the 40th anniversary of the National 
CASA/GAL Association for Children: Now, therefore, be 
it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the designation of ‘‘National

CASA/GAL Volunteers’ Day’’; and 
3
(2) commends Court Appointed Special Advo-
4
cate and Guardian ad Litem volunteers for their

dedication and hard work in advocating for the best

interest of children so that every child who has expe-

rienced abuse or neglect can be safe, have a perma-

nent home, and have the opportunity to thrive.
