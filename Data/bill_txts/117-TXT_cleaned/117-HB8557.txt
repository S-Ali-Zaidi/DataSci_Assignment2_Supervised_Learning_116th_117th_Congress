11
sequences have been expunged and, if so,

(as defined by subsection (a)(1)(B)(iii))

dividual resides or, if no such agency ex-
23
ists, the chief law enforcement officer of

the State in which the individual resides;

and

6
suant to paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not be or be-
7

notifications shall not be used by criminal justice 
10
agencies except for purposes of complying with this 
11
section and court orders issued pursuant to it. 
12
(d) APPEAL.—The Attorney General of the United 
13
States and the United States Attorney for the district 
14
from which the expungement order was issued may appeal 
15
an order, within 60 days of its issuance, to the United

23
sequences, as defined by subsection (a)(2)(A)(i)–(iii), was 
24
obtained. A petition filed pro se shall be construed liberally 
25

H8557
12 
•HR 8557 IH
so as to ensure substantial justice (see, e.g., Erickson v. 
1
Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007) (per curiam)). 
2
(b) SERVICE AND RESPONSE.—The clerk of the court 
3
shall serve that petition on the United States Attorney for 
4
that district. Not later than 60 days after service of such 
5
petition, the United States Attorney may submit a re-
6
sponse to the Petitioner’s motion. 
7
(c) REPRESENTATION AND FEES.—No fee shall be 
8
imposed for filing a petition in any proceeding provided 
9
for under this subsection. If an indigent Petitioner sub-
10
mits a facially viable claim for expungement that nonethe-
11
less requires the assistance of legal counsel for purposes 
12
of filing a superseding petition, presenting evidence in sup-
13
port of the petition, or responding to the Government, 
14
counsel shall be appointed to represent the individual in 
15
proceedings under this subsection. 
16
(d) EVIDENCE AND STANDARD OF PROOF.—The Pe-
17
titioner and the Government may file with the court rel-
18
evant evidence relating to the petition. Notwithstanding 
19
any Federal rule of evidence or procedure, the court shall 
20
have discretion in admitting and evaluating the petition 
21
and any evidence submitted by a Petitioner pro se (cf. 
22
Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520 (1972)). The Peti-
23
tioner bears the initial burden to establish a prima facie 
24
case that the official record in question is for an 
25
21:02 Oct 25, 2022
H8557
13 
•HR 8557 IH
expungable event, at which point the burden shifts to the 
1
Government to establish by a preponderance of the evi-
2
dence that the official record is not for an expungable 
3
event or the requirements for expungement have not been 
4
met. If the Government fails to meet this burden, or if 
5
the Government fails to respond to the petition, the court 
6
shall enter an appropriate expungement order unless it 
7
finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the interests 
8
of justice and of public safety weigh against expungement. 
9
(e) EXPUNGEMENT ORDER.—If required under this 
10
section, the court shall order the expungement, sealing, 
11
sequester, and redaction of official records of the arrest, 
12
legal proceedings, and any legal results or consequences, 
13
as defined by subsection (a)(2)(A)(i)–(iii). The court may 
14
also order the expungement, sealing, sequester, and redac-
15
tion of another official record related to or referencing an 
16
expungable event, unless such other official record is for 
17
or related to a felony or a misdemeanor unrelated to mari-
18
juana, in which case the court shall redact from such other 
19
official record any reference to the expunged official 
20
record, and seal or order the sequester of an unaltered 
21
nonpublic copy of such other official record. 
22
(f) NOTIFICATION OF EXPUNGEMENT.— 
23
(1) Not later than 7 days after granting an 
24
expungement petition, to facilitate the timely update 
25

occurred or, if no such agency exists, the chief 
10

13
tioner whose expungement petition was granted, the

court shall send a copy of the petition and final

17
defined by subsection (a)(1)(B)(iii)) that serves

or, if no such agency exists, the chief law en-
20
forcement officer of the State in which the Peti-
21
tioner resides, when such criminal justice agen-
22
cy or chief law enforcement officer is different

criminal justice agencies except for purposes of com-
9
plying with this section and court orders issued pur-
10
suant to it. 
11
(g) APPEAL.—The Attorney General of the United 
12
States and the United States Attorney for the district in 
13
which the expungement order was issued may appeal an 
14
order within 60 days of its issuance to the United States

9
record. 
10
(c) DISQUALIFICATION.—The fact that an individual

of such individual to pursue or engage in any lawful activ-
14

SEC. 9. INTERPRETATION AND SEVERABILITY. 
1
(a) Nothing in this section should be construed to 
2
preempt or supersede the laws of any State with respect 
3
to its authority to define and enforce the criminal law of 
4
that State, or with respect to any power reserved to the 
5
States respectively, or to the people, or to any citizen as 
6
a right, under the Constitution of the United States. This 
7
section does not annul, alter, or affect, or exempt any per-
8
son subject to this section from complying with, the laws 
9
of any State, except to the extent that those laws are in-
10
consistent with the provisions of this section, and then 
11
only to the extent of the inconsistency. This section shall 
12
not in any way abridge or alter the remedies now existing 
13
at common law or by statute, but consistent with sub-
14
section (d)(3)(B), the provisions of this section are in ad-
15
dition to such remedies. 
16
(b) If any provision of this section or the application 
17
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the 
18
remainder of this section, or the application of that provi-
19
sion to persons or circumstances other than those as to 
20
which it is held invalid, is not affected thereby. 
21
SEC. 10. EFFECTIVE DATE.
