SEC. 2. PURPOSE. 
1
The purpose of this Act is to clarify and amend the 
2
law with respect to— 
3
(1) the illegality of consciously parallel pricing 
4
coordination under sections 1 and 3(a) of the Sher-
5
man Act (15 U.S.C. 1, 3(a)); and 
6
(2) 
the 
concerted-action 
requirement 
for 
7
claimed violations of section 1 or 3(a) of the Sher-
8
man Act.

SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
10
(a) CONSCIOUSLY PARALLEL PRICING COORDINA-
11
TION.— 
12
(1) The American economy is built on the foun-
13
dations of open markets and fair competition. These 
14
core principles of economic freedom are what stimu-
15
late innovation, improve the quality of products and 
16
services, and ensure that prices are competitive. 
17
(2) The antitrust laws are designed to ensure 
18
American consumers and businesses are afforded the 
19
benefits of competition throughout the economy. The 
20
supreme evil of antitrust law is, accordingly, collu-
21
sion among market rivals. Such collusion under-
22
mines competitive markets, stifles innovation, and 
23
results in degraded quality and prices that are dic-
24
tated by competitors’ agreement rather than com-
25
petitors’ rivalry.

(3) Sections 1 and 3(a) of the Sherman Act (15 
1
U.S.C. 1, 3(a)) categorically prohibit—as the most 
2
pernicious types of contracts, combinations in the 
3
form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracies, in re-
4
straint of trade or commerce—naked agreements 
5
among actual or potential competitors to fix prices, 
6
rig bids, or allocate markets. An agreement to fix 
7
the quantity of products or services bought or sold 
8
is a form of agreement to fix prices. These agree-
9
ments are per se unlawful. 
10
(4) Courts have been unduly hostile to claims of 
11
price fixing that are based on tacit agreement 
12
among competitors. They have, at times, declined to 
13
recognize tacit agreement as a contract, combination 
14
in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy; they 
15
have held that allegations or evidence, taken as a 
16
whole, that are as consistent with ‘‘conscious par-
17
allelism’’ as with agreement are generally insuffi-
18
cient to survive a motion to dismiss or motion for 
19
summary judgment; and they have concluded a 
20
claimant must offer allegations or evidence tending 
21
to exclude the possibility of independent action. See, 
22
e.g., Brooke Grp. Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson To-
23
bacco Corp., 509 U.S. 209, 227 (1993); Matsushita 
24
Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S.

574, 588 (1986); Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Serv. 
1
Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 764 (1984). 
2
(5) Section 4 of this Act rejects the judicial de-
3
cisions that have prevented meritorious price-fixing 
4
cases from advancing to trial and judgment. It does 
5
so by providing that, in civil actions, consciously par-
6
allel pricing coordination—as defined by this Act— 
7
is a ‘‘contract, combination in the form of trust or 
8
otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or 
9
commerce’’ under sections 1 and 3(a) of the Sher-
10
man Act. 
11
(6) Section 4 of this Act does not supersede the 
12
law governing price fixing. It instead supplements 
13
and complements that law. It does not apply to 
14
criminal prosecutions. 
15
(b) CONCERTED ACTION.— 
16
(1) The words ‘‘contract, combination in the 
17
form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy’’ in sections 
18
1 and 3(a) of the Sherman Act require some form 
19
of agreement between two or more persons, but that 
20
agreement need not be expressly made. A tacit 
21
agreement also qualifies. Accordingly, the words 
22
‘‘contract, combination in the form of trust or other-
23
wise, or conspiracy’’ encompass both express and 
24
tacit agreements.

(2) Although consciously parallel behavior alone 
1
does not constitute a contract, combination in the 
2
form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy under sec-
3
tions 1 and 3(a) of the Sherman Act, consciously 
4
parallel behavior can be evidence of an agreement. 
5
And once the consciously parallel behavior crosses 
6
the line into consciously parallel coordination, the 
7
behavior qualifies as tacit agreement—that is, a con-
8
tract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, 
9
or conspiracy.

(3) In Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 
11
U.S. 544, 548–49, 553–57, 564–70 (2007), the Su-
12
preme Court held that a complaint alleging that 
13
competitors engaged in parallel, anticompetitive con-
14
duct did not do enough to exclude the possibility 
15
that the competitors engaged in independent action 
16
and therefore failed to plausibly plead the existence 
17
of a conspiracy under section 1 of the Sherman Act. 
18
In so holding, the Court understated the significance 
19
of consciously parallel behavior as evidence of agree-
20
ment and left little or no room for tacit agreements 
21
in the meaning of ‘‘contract, combination in the 
22
form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy’’. 
23
(4) Section 5 of this Act rejects the Twombly 
24
Court’s cramped reading of the Sherman Act’s lan-

SEC. 4. CONSCIOUSLY PARALLEL PRICING COORDINATION. 
7
(a) DEFINITIONS.— 
8
(1) The term ‘‘consciously parallel pricing co-
9
ordination’’ means a tacit agreement among two or 
10
more persons to raise, lower, change, maintain, or 
11
manipulate pricing for the purchase or sale of rea-
12
sonably interchangeable products or services. 
13
(2) The term ‘‘person’’ has the meaning given 
14
the term in subsection (a) of the first section of the 
15
Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12(a)). 
16
(b) CONSCIOUSLY PARALLEL PRICING COORDINA-
17
TION.—In a civil action, including an action brought by 
18
the United States or by a State attorney general, or by 
19
the Federal Trade Commission under section 5 of the Fed-
20
eral Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45), consciously 
21
parallel pricing coordination is a ‘‘contract, combination 
22
in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in re-
23
straint of trade or commerce’’ under sections 1 and 3(a) 
24
of the Sherman Act (15 U.S.C. 1, 3(a)).

•HR 8777 IH
(c) PRIMA FACIE CASE.— 
1
(1) A claimant establishes a prima facie case of 
2
consciously parallel pricing coordination by dem-
3
onstrating that two or more persons— 
4
(A) engaged in substantially similar action, 
5
within a substantially similar time period, with 
6
respect to pricing for reasonably interchange-
7
able products or services; and 
8
(B) had a substantially similar motivation 
9
to coordinate their efforts to raise, lower, 
10
change, maintain, or manipulate pricing for the 
11
purchase or sale of reasonably interchangeable 
12
products or services. 
13
(2) A claimant asserting a claim of consciously 
14
parallel pricing coordination in violation of section 1 
15
or 3(a) of the Sherman Act bears the burden of 
16
proving the prima facie case described in paragraph 
17
(1) by a preponderance of evidence, at which point 
18
the burden of production shifts to the defending 
19
party as set forth in subsection (d). 
20
(d) BURDEN OF REBUTTING PRIMA FACIE CASE.— 
21
The defending party bears the burden of rebutting a prima 
22
facie case of consciously parallel pricing coordination by 
23
producing evidence, sufficient to raise a genuine dispute 
24
of material fact, that the defending party’s action de-
25
21:49 Sep 06, 2022
H8777

•HR 8777 IH
scribed in paragraph (1)(A) of subsection (c) was moti-
1
vated by business judgment that is economically rational 
2
in the absence of any consciously parallel pricing coordina-
3
tion. Evidence of this nature may include, but is not lim-
4
ited to, evidence that the defending party acted rationally 
5
in response to or in anticipation of changing conditions 
6
affecting the market for or the marketability of the prod-
7
ucts or services concerned. 
8
(e) ULTIMATE BURDEN.—If the defending party re-
9
buts the prima facie case, the burden shifts back to the 
10
claimant to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, 
11
that the defending party entered a tacit agreement among 
12
two or more persons to raise, lower, change, maintain, or 
13
manipulate pricing for the purchase or sale of reasonably 
14
interchangeable products or services. The claimant may do 
15
so by means that include, but are not limited to, proving 
16
that— 
17
(1) the business judgment described in sub-
18
section (d) was not— 
19
(A) economically rational in the absence of 
20
consciously parallel pricing coordination; or 
21
(B) the predominant motivating factor for 
22
the defending party’s action described in para-
23
graph (1)(A) of subsection (c); 
24
21:49 Sep 06, 2022

•HR 8777 IH
(2) the defending party, knowing that coordi-
1
nated action to raise, lower, change, maintain, or 
2
manipulate pricing for the purchase or sale of rea-
3
sonably interchangeable products or services was 
4
contemplated and invited by a competitor, adhered 
5
to the scheme and participated in it; or 
6
(3) based on circumstantial evidence implying a 
7
traditional conspiracy, it is more likely than not that 
8
the defending party entered an agreement among 
9
two or more persons to raise, lower, change, main-
10
tain, or manipulate pricing for the purchase or sale 
11
of reasonably interchangeable products or services. 
12
(f) AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE.—It is an affirmative de-
13
fense to a claim of consciously parallel pricing coordina-
14
tion, on which the defending party bears the burden of 
15
proof by a preponderance of the evidence, that any affirm-
16
ative defense to price fixing applies.

20
(a) MEANING OF CONTRACT, COMBINATION IN THE 
21
FORM OF TRUST OR OTHERWISE, OR CONSPIRACY.—A 
22
tacit agreement is a form of ‘‘contract, combination in the

form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy’’ under sections 
24
1 and 3(a) of the Sherman Act (15 U.S.C. 1, 3(a)).

civil action, including an action brought by the United 
2
States or by a State attorney general, or by the Federal 
3
Trade Commission under section 5 of the Federal Trade 
4
Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45)— 
5
(1) a complaint— 
6
(A) plausibly pleads a ‘‘contract, combina-
7
tion in the form of trust or otherwise, or con-
8
spiracy’’ under sections 1 and 3(a) of the Sher-
9
man Act if the complaint contains factual alle-
10
gations, which may consist of allegations of con-
11
sciously parallel conduct, demonstrating that 
12
the existence of the alleged contract, combina-
13
tion in the form of trust or otherwise, or con-
14
spiracy is among the realm of plausible possi-
15
bilities; and 
16
(B) need not allege facts tending to ex-
17
clude the possibility of independent action to 
18
plausibly plead the existence of a ‘‘contract, 
19
combination in the form of trust or otherwise, 
20
or conspiracy’’ under sections 1 and 3(a) of the 
21
Sherman Act; and 
22
(2) a claimant—

‘‘contract, combination in the form of trust or 
1
otherwise, or conspiracy’’ under sections 1 and 
2
3(a) of the Sherman Act by offering evidence, 
3
which may be direct or circumstantial, that is 
4
sufficient to allow a trier of fact to reasonably 
5
conclude that the defending party entered the 
6
contract, combination in the form of trust or 
7
otherwise, or conspiracy; and 
8
(B) need not offer evidence tending to ex-

demonstrate a genuine dispute of material fact

that a defending party entered a ‘‘contract,

combination in the form of trust or otherwise, 
13
or conspiracy’’ under sections 1 and 3(a) of the 
14
Sherman Act; although, at trial, the trier of 
15
fact may consider the existence or absence of 
16
evidence tending to exclude the possibility of 
17
independent action when determining whether a 
18
defending party entered the contract, combina-
19
tion in the form of trust or otherwise, or con-
20
spiracy.
