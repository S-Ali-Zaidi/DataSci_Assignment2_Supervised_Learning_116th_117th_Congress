A BILL 
To amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for 
the establishment of the National Center for Alternatives 
to Animals in Research and Testing, and for other pur-
poses. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Humane Research and

Testing Act of 2021’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

The Congress finds as follows:

•HR 1744 IH
(1) The mission of the National Institutes of 
1
Health (NIH) is to seek fundamental knowledge 
2
about the nature and behavior of living systems and 
3
the application of that knowledge to enhance health, 
4
lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. 
5
(2) Much of NIH’s research is carried out on 
6
animals. However, the precise number of animals 
7
used in research in the United States is unknown. 
8
Estimates range between 17 million and 100 million 
9
animals used annually. Such imprecise numbers 
10
make it impossible to effectively track and reduce 
11
the numbers of animals used, as mandated by the 
12
NIH policies to ensure the smallest possible number 
13
of animals are used. 
14
(3) There is widespread agreement among sci-
15
entists and regulatory agencies that animal models 
16
are poor predictors of the human response, with over 
17
90 percent of new candidate drugs never making it 
18
to market. 
19
(4) More than 30 percent of promising medica-
20
tions have failed in human clinical trials because 
21
they are found to be toxic despite promising pre-clin-
22
ical studies in animal models. An additional 65 per-
23
cent of candidate drugs that pass animal trials fail 
24
due to lack of efficacy.

•HR 1744 IH
(5) Despite the ever-increasing growth in ani-
1
mal procedures, there is no corresponding increase 
2
in the number of human medicines making it to the 
3
clinic. 
4
(6) Dramatically rising costs and extremely 
5
high failure rates in drug development have led 
6
many to re-evaluate the value of animal studies. 
7
(7) Effective alternatives to animals are avail-
8
able and growing. Cutting-edge technology has 
9
forged new frontiers in biology and medicine that 
10
have produced human-relevant models, including 
11
organoid cell cultures, organs-on-chips, genomics, in-
12
duced pluripotent adult stem cells, 3D modeling with 
13
human cells, high throughput technology, molecular 
14
imaging, computer models, in silico trials, digital im-
15
aging, artificial intelligence, and other innovative 
16
methods—all of which have launched a technological 
17
revolution in biomedical research. 
18
(8) Despite these cutting-edge, human-relevant 
19
methods, a preponderance of NIH research is car-
20
ried out on animals. A 2019 news release from NIH 
21
indicates that 70 percent of NIH grant applications 
22
relate to studies using mice. 
23
(9) The American public has expressed concern 
24
about subjecting animals to the pain of experimen-
25

•HR 1744 IH
tation. This concern grows as alternatives to re-
1
search on animals become available. 
2
(10) Under the system of oversight established 
3
by the National Institutes of Health Revitalization 
4
Act of 1993 (Public Law 103–43), NIH is supposed 
5
to outline a plan for reducing the use of animals in 
6
research. Section 404C(a)(1) of the Public Health 
7
Service Act (42 U.S.C. 283e(a)(1)), as added by sec-
8
tion 205 of the National Institutes of Health Revi-
9
talization Act of 1993, calls for NIH to ‘‘conduct or 
10
support research into . . . methods of biomedical re-
11
search and experimentation that do not require the 
12
use of animals and methods of such research and ex-
13
perimentation that reduce the number of animals 
14
used in such research’’. 
15
(11) A dedicated center that provides resources, 
16
funding, and training to encourage researchers to 
17
utilize humane, cost-effective, and scientifically suit-
18
able non-animal methods is needed to fulfill the in-
19
tent of the National Institutes of Health Revitaliza-
20
tion Act of 1993 (Public Law 103–43).
