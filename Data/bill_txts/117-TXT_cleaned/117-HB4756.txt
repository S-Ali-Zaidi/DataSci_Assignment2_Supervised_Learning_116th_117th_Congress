•HR 4756 IH
(1) Individuals with disabilities can maintain 
1
and improve their health through appropriate phys-
2
ical activity. 
3
(2) In the 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines for 
4
Americans (referred to in this section as the ‘‘Guide-
5
lines’’), the Department of Health and Human Serv-
6
ices recommends that individuals with disabilities, 
7
who are able, participate in regular aerobic activity. 
8
(3) The Guidelines also recommend that adults 
9
with disabilities, who are able, do muscle strength-
10
ening activities of moderate or high intensity on two 
11
or more days a week, as these activities provide ad-
12
ditional health benefits. 
13
(4) The Guidelines recommend that when 
14
adults with disabilities are not able to meet the 
15
Guidelines, they should engage in regular physical 
16
activity according to their abilities and avoid inac-
17
tivity. 
18
(5) Physical inactivity by adults with disabilities 
19
can lead to increased risk for functional limitations 
20
and secondary health conditions. 
21
(6) Many individuals with disabilities are unable 
22
to engage in the exercises or fitness activities rec-
23
ommended in the Guidelines due to the failure of ex-

•HR 4756 IH
ercise or fitness service providers to provide acces-
1
sible exercise or fitness equipment. 
2
(7) The failure to provide accessible exercise or 
3
fitness equipment constitutes discrimination in viola-
4
tion of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 
5
(referred to in this section as the ‘‘ADA’’). 
6
(b) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act is— 
7
(1) to carry out the ADA’s objectives of pro-
8
viding ‘‘a clear and comprehensive national mandate 
9
for the elimination of discrimination’’ and ‘‘clear, 
10
strong, consistent, enforceable standards addressing 
11
discrimination’’; and 
12
(2) specifically, to carry out those objectives by 
13
issuing guidelines and regulations for exercise or fit-
14
ness service providers specifying the accessible exer-
15
cise or fitness equipment, and the accessible exercise 
16
or fitness classes and instruction, necessary to en-
17
sure that individuals with disabilities can— 
18
(A) obtain the benefits of physical activity; 
19
and 
20
(B) fully participate in the services offered 
21
by exercise or fitness service providers.
