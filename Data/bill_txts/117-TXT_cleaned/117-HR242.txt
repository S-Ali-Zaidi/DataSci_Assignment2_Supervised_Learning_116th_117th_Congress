RESOLUTION 
Raising awareness of the racial disparities in the impact 
of colorectal cancer on the Black community. 
Whereas colorectal cancer, or CRC, is the third-most common 
cancer in the United States for men and women com-
bined, and the second leading cause of cancer death; 
Whereas this disease takes the lives of more than 50,000 peo-
ple each year; 
Whereas the rate of CRC is 24 percent higher among Black 
men and is 19 percent higher among Black women than 
compared to non-Hispanic Whites;

Whereas the rate of CRC death is 47 percent higher among 
Black men and is 34 percent higher among Black women 
than compared to non-Hispanic Whites; 
Whereas CRC is the third-leading cause of cancer death in 
both Black men and women in the United States; 
Whereas deaths from colorectal cancer among people younger 
than 55 have increased one percent per year from 2008 
to 2017; 
Whereas the tragic death of 43-year-old actor Chadwick 
Boseman from colorectal cancer has catalyzed more con-
versation about CRC’s impact on the Black community; 
Whereas getting screened for CRC is highly recommended at 
age 50, and currently the United States Preventive Serv-
ices Task Force is considering a recommendation to 
lower the age at which people should first get screened 
to 45; and 
Whereas CRC has a 90-percent survival rate when caught at 
the earliest stage and there are many screening methods 
available: Now, therefore, be it
