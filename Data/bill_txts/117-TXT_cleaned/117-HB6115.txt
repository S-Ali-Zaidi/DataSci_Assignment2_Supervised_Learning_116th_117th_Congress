A BILL 
To amend the Federal Funding Accountability and Trans-
parency Act of 2006 to require the Director of the Office 
of Management and Budget and the Secretary of the 
Treasury to track and disclose funding and outlays relat-
ing to disasters and emergencies on a centralized website, 
and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Disclosing All Spend-
4

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) At a time of constrained budgets, it is fis-
3
cally prudent to understand the amount and the 
4
scope of the Federal Government’s funding and out-
5
lays relating to disasters and emergencies affecting 
6
communities in need. 
7
(2) Understanding the funding and outlays of 
8
Federal agencies relating to disasters and emer-
9
gencies will help better inform the congressional 
10
funding process and presidential budget requests. 
11
(3) Knowledge about funding and outlay trends 
12
relating to disasters and emergencies will guide miti-
13
gation efforts that reduce vulnerabilities to future 
14
disasters and emergencies. 
15
(4) Any accounting mechanism to track outlays 
16
relating to disasters and emergencies should account 
17
for all funding sources, including both procurement 
18
and financial assistance funding, regardless of how 
19
that funding is appropriated. 
20
(5) The Federal Government’s fiscal exposure 
21
to disasters and emergencies is not limited to the 
22
funding and outlays of Federal agencies and should 
23
also include financial damages associated with disas-
24
ters and emergencies. For example, financial dam-
25
ages associated with wildfires may exceed the 
26
23:22 Dec 10, 2021
H6115
3 
•HR 6115 IH
amount that Federal agencies actually spend in re-
1
sponse to wildfires. The difference in damages and 
2
outlays illustrates the Federal Government’s fiscal 
3
exposure to wildfires. Although some Federal agen-
4
cies currently track financial damages associated 
5
with disasters and emergencies, this tracking should 
6
be consistent and standardized across all relevant 
7
Federal agencies. 
8
(6) Data quality issues in business systems 
9
used by Federal agencies and recipients of Federal 
10
awards hinder analysis and learning opportunities 
11
about funding and outlays relating to disasters and 
12
emergencies. 
13
SEC. 3. PURPOSE. 
14
The purpose of this Act is to require— 
15
(1) relevant Federal agencies and components 
16
of Federal agencies to track and report to the Direc-
17
tor of the Office of Management and Budget and 
18
the Secretary of the Treasury data on funding, out-
19
lays, and, to the extent practicable, financial dam-
20
ages relating to disasters and emergencies for publi-
21
cation on a centralized website; 
22
(2) the Comptroller General to study and rec-
23
ommend data quality remediation measures for the
