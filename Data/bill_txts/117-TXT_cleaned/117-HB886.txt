A BILL 
To provide funds through the Social Services Block Grant 
program for diaper assistance. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘COVID–19 Diaper As-

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Infants need between 6 to 12 diapers a day. 
8
Infants and toddlers lacking access to clean diapers

have a greater risk for health complications, which 
1
require costly and difficult to access medical care. 
2
(2) Prior to the COVID–19 pandemic, surveys 
3
indicated that 1 in 3 families in the United States 
4
with young children could not afford an adequate 
5
supply of diapers to keep their child clean, dry, and 
6
healthy. 
7
(3) Low-income families pay an even higher 
8
than average price for diapers because they do not 
9
have access to money saving alternatives such as 
10
bulk buying or online shopping that can reduce 
11
costs. Low-income families spend about 14 percent 
12
of their income on diapers. 
13
(4) Clean diaper access presents a financial and 
14
stressful burden on families’ dependent on child care 
15
services. Research indicates that when diaper need is 
16
a barrier to child care, parents miss an average of 
17
4 workdays a month. 
18
(5) The COVID–19 pandemic has further 
19
raised demand for diapers and strained diaper 
20
banks’ ability to meet low-income families’ needs. 
21
Prior to the COVID–19 pandemic, nonprofit diaper 
22
bank distribution only met 5 to 6 percent of diaper 
23
need. Since the start of the COVID–19 pandemic, 
24
diaper banks around the country have experienced

double, triple, or greater increase in demand for dia-

pers due to the pandemic and economic shutdown. 
2
Nonprofits alone cannot fully address this public 
3
health crisis that impacts 1 in 3 families in the

United States.
