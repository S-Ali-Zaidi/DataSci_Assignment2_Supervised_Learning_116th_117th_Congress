SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
1
It is the sense of Congress that— 
2
(1) if current trends continue, average global 
3
temperatures are likely to reach 1.5 degrees Celsius 
4
above pre-industrial levels between 2030 and 2050; 
5
(2) global temperature rise has already resulted 
6
in an increased number of heavy rainstorms, coastal 
7
flooding events, heat waves, wildfires, and other ex-
8
treme events; 
9
(3) since 1980— 
10
(A) the number of extreme weather events 
11
per year that cost the people of the United 
12
States more than $1,000,000,000 per event, ac-
13
counting for inflation, has increased signifi-
14
cantly; and 
15
(B) the total cost of extreme weather 
16
events in the United States has exceeded 
17
$1,875,000,000,000; 
18
(4) as physical impacts from climate change are 
19
manifested across multiple sectors of the economy of 
20
the United States— 
21
(A) climate-related economic risks will con-
22
tinue to increase; 
23
(B) climate-related extreme weather events 
24
will disrupt energy and transportation systems 
25
in the United States, which will result in more 
26

frequent and longer-lasting power outages, fuel 
1
shortages, and service disruptions in critical 
2
sectors across the economy of the United 
3
States; 
4
(C) projected increases in extreme heat 
5
conditions will lead to decreases in labor pro-
6
ductivity in agriculture, construction, and other 
7
critical economic sectors; 
8
(D) food and livestock production will be 
9
impacted in regions that experience increases in 
10
heat and drought and small rural communities 
11
will struggle to find the resources needed to 
12
adapt to those changes; and 
13
(E) sea level rise and more frequent and 
14
intense extreme weather events will— 
15
(i) increasingly disrupt and damage 
16
private property and critical infrastructure; 
17
and 
18
(ii) drastically increase insured and 
19
uninsured losses; 
20
(5) advances in energy efficiency and renewable 
21
energy technologies, as well as climate policies and 
22
shifting societal preferences, will— 
23
(A) reduce global demand for fossil fuels;

1
companies and investors, and for companies 
2
and investors in other energy-intensive indus-
3
tries, which could include trillions of dollars of 
4
stranded assets around the world; 
5
(6) climate change poses uniquely far-reaching 
6
risks to the financial services industry, including 
7
with respect to credit, counterparty, and market 
8
risks, due to the number of sectors and locations im-
9
pacted and the potentially irreversible scale of dam-
10
age; 
11
(7) financial institutions must take a consistent 
12
approach to assessing climate-related financial risks 
13
and incorporating those risks into existing risk man-
14
agement practices, which should be informed by sce-
15
nario analysis; 
16
(8) the Board of Governors conducts annual as-
17
sessments of the capital adequacy and capital plan-
18
ning practices of the largest and most complex bank-
19
ing organizations (referred to in this section as 
20
‘‘stress tests’’) in order to promote a safe, sound, 
21
and efficient banking and financial system; 
22
(9) as of the date of enactment of this Act, the 
23
stress tests conducted by the Board of Governors are

2
(10) the Board of Governors— 
3
(A) has the authority to take into account 
4
the potentially systemic impact of climate-re-
5
lated risks on the financial system; and 
6
(B) should develop new analytical tools 
7
with longer time horizons to accurately assess 
8
and manage the risks described in subpara-

10
(11) the Climate-Related Market Risk Sub-
