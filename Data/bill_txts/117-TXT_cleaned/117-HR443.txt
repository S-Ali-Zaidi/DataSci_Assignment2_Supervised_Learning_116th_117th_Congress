RESOLUTION 
Honoring the 50th anniversary of Alligator Records. 
Whereas Chicago blues music has its roots deep in the Mis-
sissippi Delta and was carried north in the Great Migra-
tion of 1916–1970 by the millions of African Americans 
who migrated to northern industrial cities in search of 
good jobs and to escape from Jim Crow racism; 
Whereas Chicago’s blues community nurtured thousands of 
musicians and dozens of record labels, and the city be-
came the world capital of blues and eventually gave birth 
to Alligator Records and the rich, soulful Chicago blues 
heritage and culture that we know and love today;

Whereas with nothing but his love of the blues and entrepre-
neurial spirit, Bruce Iglauer founded Alligator Records in 
1971 at the age of 23, using all his savings to record his 
favorite Chicago blues band, Hound Dog Taylor and the 
HouseRockers, although the band had no national pres-
ence, no booking agent, no manager, no publicist, and 
played almost entirely in tiny neighborhood clubs on the 
South and West Sides of Chicago; 
Whereas beginning with this one album, Iglauer built a blues 
record label that is now celebrating its 50th birthday; 
Whereas today, Alligator Records is the largest independent 
blues label in the world, with over 350 albums and an 
artist roster that ranges in age from 22 to 78, and has 
won three Grammy Awards and an astonishing 48 nomi-
nations, as well as over 150 Blues Music Awards and 
over 115 Living Blues Awards; and 
Whereas Alligator Records has been a driving force in sup-
port of Chicago blues and blues music worldwide, and a 
glowing example of our country’s rich tradition of musical 
and entrepreneurial spirit: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—

(1) honors Alligator Records on 50 years of

business and celebrates the American cultural legacy

of Chicago blues music; 
4
(2) encourages the United States Government
