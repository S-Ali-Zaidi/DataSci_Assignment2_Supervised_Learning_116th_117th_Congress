RESOLUTION 
Recognizing that allowing illegal immigrants the right to 
vote devalues the franchise and diminishes the voting 
power of United States citizens. 
Whereas voting is fundamental to a functioning democracy; 
Whereas the Constitution prohibits discrimination in voting 
based on race, sex, poll taxes, and age; 
Whereas it is of paramount importance that the United 
States maintains the legitimacy of its elections and pro-
tects them from interference, including interference from 
foreign threats and illegal voting; 
Whereas the city of San Francisco, California, is allowing 
non-citizens, including illegal immigrants, to register to 
vote in school board elections;
