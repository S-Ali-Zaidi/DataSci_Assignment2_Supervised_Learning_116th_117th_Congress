SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds as follows: 
2
(1) Nearly 18 percent of adults in the United 
3
States reported a mental, behavioral, or emotional 
4
disorder in 2015. 
5
(2) Children are also significantly impacted. Ac-
6
cording to the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
7
vention, 1 in 6 children ages 2 years through 8 years 
8
have a diagnosed mental, behavioral, or develop-
9
mental disorder, indicating that disorders begin in 
10
early childhood and affect lifelong health. 
11
(3) Moreover, 1 in 7 children and adolescents 
12
have at least one treatable mental health disorder. 
13
(4) There is a critical link between mental 
14
health and substance use disorders. According to the 
15
Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Ad-
16
ministration, 1 in 4 adults with severe mental illness 
17
had a substance use disorder in 2017. 
18
(5) Moreover, children who have had a major 
19
depressive episode are more than twice as likely to 
20
use illicit drugs. 
21
(6) In 2017, approximately 19.7 million people 
22
aged 12 years or older had a substance use disorder 
23
related to their use of alcohol or illicit drugs in the 
24
past year.

(7) Despite this overwhelming need, access to 
1
behavioral health services remains among the most 
2
pressing health care challenges in our country. 
3
(8) An estimated 56 percent of Americans with 
4
a mental health disorder did not receive treatment in 
5
2017. 
6
(9) Similarly, half of children and adolescents 
7
did not receive treatment for their mental health dis-
8
order in 2016. 
9
(10) Further complicating access to care, as de-
10
mand for behavioral health services increases in 
11
communities across the United States, the number 
12
of psychiatrists available to treat them continues to 
13
decline. 
14
(11) The population of practicing psychiatrists 
15
declined by more than 10 percent between the period 
16
of 2003 through 2013, while the population of pri-
17
mary care physicians and neurologists grew during 
18
the same period. 
19
(12) Technology has evolved to connect individ-
20
uals to health care services in new ways, including 
21
via telehealth. 
22
(13) Moreover, studies show that video visits 
23
are an effective strategy to provide mental health

treatment to children and, in fact, may be preferable 
1
in some cases. 
2
(14) During the 115th Congress, Congress rec-
3
ognized the potential of telehealth to ensure that 
4
those in urgent need of substance use disorder treat-
5
ment receive the care they require. 
6
(15) As passed and signed into law, sections 
7
2001 and 1009 of the SUPPORT for Patients and 
8
Communities Act (Public Law 115–271) expands 
9
the use of telehealth services for the treatment of 
10
opioid use disorder and other substance use dis-
11
orders. 
12
(16) It is widely recognized that there is a close 
13
relationship between mental health and substance 
14
use disorders.
