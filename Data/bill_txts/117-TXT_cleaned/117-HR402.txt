RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the devastating impact of COVID–19 in India 
and expressing the sense of the House of Representatives 
with respect to COVID assistance to India. 
Whereas, in March 2021, a second wave of Coronavirus Dis-
ease 2019 (commonly referred to as ‘‘COVID–19’’) infec-
tions began to surge in India, overwhelming health care 
workers, hospitals, and crematoriums throughout the 
country; 
Whereas testing results indicate India is seeing more than 
340,000 new daily infections and upward of 4,000 deaths 
a day, though many public health experts believe case 
rates are higher; 
Whereas the deadly COVID–19 outbreak in India is a global 
problem that requires a coordinated global response;

Whereas, in the spring of 2020, when the United States was 
in the midst of a devastating spike in COVID–19 cases, 
India lifted its export ban on certain therapeutics in re-
sponse to a request by the United States Government; 
Whereas India’s pharmaceutical industry is a vital part of the 
global solution to the pandemic, especially for much of 
Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and is the world’s big-
gest producer of COVID vaccines having exported 66.36 
million doses to 93 countries, including to United Nations 
personnel and, accounting for over half of global vaccine 
manufacturing; 
Whereas due to India’s critical importance in global vaccine 
supply chains, an increase in domestic vaccine demand as 
a result of the surge of COVID–19 cases within India is 
of global concern; 
Whereas in response to the crisis in India, the Biden admin-
istration took quick action to deliver urgently needed sup-
plies to India, including oxygen support, oxygen con-
centrators, personal protective equipment (PPE), raw 
materials for vaccine, rapid diagnostic tests, and thera-
peutics, and is a testament to the historic record of 
United States-India health cooperation dating more than 
seven decades; 
Whereas the United States private sector has worked to gen-
erously support relief efforts in India including by work-
ing to deliver 1,000 ventilators and 25,000 oxygen con-
centrators to health care facilities across India; 
Whereas many countries around the world have also sent 
medical assistance to India to help the country defeat 
this devastating wave of the COVID–19 pandemic;

Whereas as the United States vaccine supply for the Amer-
ican people is secured, it is important for the United 
States to continue to ramp up its efforts, working with 
the private sector and all possible partners, to expand 
vaccine manufacturing and distribution worldwide; and 
Whereas United States support for India to help beat back 
this latest coronavirus wave is in the United States na-
tional interest as the pandemic will not end anywhere 
until it ends everywhere: Now, therefore, be it
