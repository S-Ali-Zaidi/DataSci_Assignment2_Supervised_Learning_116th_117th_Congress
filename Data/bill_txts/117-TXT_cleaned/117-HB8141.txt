partment of Defense, beginning upon the acces-
21
sion of a member to the Armed Forces and re-
22
peated at regular intervals thereafter, with the 
23
goal of detecting any need for cognitive en-
24
hancement or restoration resulting from poten-
25
tial brain exposures of the member, to mitigate

(B) The identification and dissemination of 
3
thresholds for blast pressure safety and associ-
4
ated emerging scientific evidence. 
5
(C) The modification of high-risk training

and operational activities to mitigate the nega-
7
tive effects of repetitive blast exposure. 
8
(D) The identification of individuals who

10
tivities, for purposes of increased monitoring of

19
health of members of the Armed Forces.

21
would set forth specific criteria used in the 
22
awarding of potential grants for research 
23
projects relating to the direct correlation of en-
