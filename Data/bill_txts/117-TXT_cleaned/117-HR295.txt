RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the United States Trade Representative should promptly 
resume negotiations to conclude the Environmental 
Goods Agreement. 
Whereas climate change is an existential threat to our way 
of life, impacting our health, national security, and eco-
nomic prosperity; 
Whereas transitioning towards a low-emissions economy must 
be a priority for all countries; 
Whereas the United States is only responsible for 13 percent 
of global emissions; 
Whereas the United States must seek to address climate 
change through domestic policy and global action;

Whereas, on July 8, 2014, the United States and other mem-
ber countries of the World Trade Organization, account-
ing for nearly 90 percent of global exports in environ-
mental goods, began negotiations on the Environmental 
Goods Agreement; 
Whereas the Environmental Goods Agreement would elimi-
nate tariffs on a broad range of environmental goods in-
cluding wind turbines, water treatment filters, solar 
water heaters, and bicycles; 
Whereas the United States is a leader in the development of 
environmental goods, but such goods can face tariffs as 
high as 50 percent when exported to other countries; 
Whereas the negotiations represent a significant opportunity 
to help countries across the world access high-quality af-
fordable environmental goods while also leveling the play-
ing field for American manufacturers and supporting 
green jobs; and 
Whereas reengaging on the Environmental Goods Agreement 
must be part of a larger set of efforts aimed at com-
bating the climate emergency, achieving a clean energy 
economy, and reaching net-zero emissions by the year 
2050: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-
1
resentatives that not later than 90 days after the date of 
2
the adoption of this resolution, the United States Trade 
3
Representative should resume negotiations to conclude the 
4
Environmental Goods Agreement.
