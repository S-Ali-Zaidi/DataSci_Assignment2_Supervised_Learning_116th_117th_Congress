SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Armenian Genocide 
2
Education Act’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) The United States has demonstrated a com-
6
mitment to remembrance and education about the 
7
Armenian Genocide of 1915–1923 through the 
8
United States Government’s May 28, 1951, written 
9
statement to the International Court of Justice re-
10
garding the Convention on the Prevention and Pun-
11
ishment of the Crime of Genocide; through President 
12
Ronald Reagan’s Proclamation No. 4838 on April 
13
22, 1981; by H.J. Res 148, adopted on April 8, 
14
1975; H.J. Res 247, adopted on September 10, 
15
1984; H. Res. 296, adopted on October 29, 2019; S. 
16
Res. 150, adopted on December 12, 2019; and 
17
President Joe Biden’s April 24, 2021, statement 
18
recognizing the Armenian Genocide. 
19
(2) H. Res. 296 and S. Res. 150 cite the Otto-
20
man Empire’s ‘‘campaign of genocide against Arme-
21
nian, Greek, Assyrian, Chaldean, Syriac, Aramean, 
22
Maronite and other Christians’’, and call on the 
23
United States to— 
24
(A) ‘‘reject efforts to enlist, engage, or oth-
25
erwise associate the United States Government 
26
00:34 Apr 22, 2022

•HR 7555 IH
with denial of the Armenian Genocide or any 
1
other genocide’’; and 
2
(B) ‘‘encourage education and public un-
3
derstanding of the facts of the Armenian Geno-
4
cide, including the United States role in the hu-
5
manitarian relief effort, and the relevance of 
6
the Armenian Genocide to modern-day crimes 
7
against humanity’’. 
8
(3) Today, those who deny that the Ottoman 
9
Empire systematically planned, organized, and im-
10
plemented a campaign of genocide against Arme-
11
nian, Greek, Assyrian, Chaldean, Syriac, Aramean, 
12
Maronite, and other Christians or who seek to dis-
13
tort the true nature of these crimes continue to find 
14
forums, especially online. This denial and distortion 
15
dishonors those who were persecuted, murdered, dis-
16
possessed, and exiled, making it even more of a na-
17
tional imperative to educate students in the United 
18
States so that they may explore the lessons that 
19
these crimes provide for all people, sensitize commu-
20
nities to the circumstances that gave rise to these 
21
crimes, and help youth be less susceptible to the 
22
falsehood of genocide denial and distortion and to 
23
the destructive messages of hate that arise from de-
24
nial and distortion.
