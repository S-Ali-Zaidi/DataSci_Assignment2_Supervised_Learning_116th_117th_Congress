ment to make grants to nonprofit community organiza-
tions for the development of open space on municipally 
owned vacant lots in urban areas. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.

The Congress finds that—

•HR 6496 IH
(1) open spaces and community parks are a 
1
critically important portion of urban infrastructure; 
2
(2) many inner-city areas suffer from a lack of 
3
public open space for community residents to use for 
4
recreation, social interaction, and relief from dense 
5
urban conditions; 
6
(3) vacant lots, many in public ownership as a 
7
result of tax foreclosures, are common in inner-city 
8
areas; 
9
(4) the recent economic recession substantially 
10
increased the number of such vacant lots; 
11
(5) such lots often become drug trafficking 
12
areas, thereby decreasing the value of surrounding 
13
property and leading to higher crime rates in inner- 
14
city areas; and 
15
(6) the refurbishment of such lots, by removing 
16
garbage and rubble and creating well-lighted and 
17
maintained open spaces and community parks, 
18
would establish positive assets for surrounding com-
19
munities, provide positive outlets for community 
20
youth, increase property values, make other types of 
21
investment in the communities more attractive, and 
22
generally improve the quality of life for residents of 
23
the affected communities.
