(later changed to the House Democracy Partnership, 
1
hereafter referred to as ‘‘HDP’’) to work directly 
2
with parliaments around the world to support the 
3
development of effective, independent, and respon-
4
sive legislative institutions. 
5
(2) HDP approved a legislative strengthening 
6
partnership with Burma in 2016 and organized the 
7
first congressional delegation to meet with the new 
8
civilian-led government, led by State Counselor Aung 
9
San Suu Kyi, and civil society leaders in May 2016. 
10
(3) On February 2, 2021, the U.S. Department 
11
of State assessed that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the 
12
leader of Burma’s ruling party, and President Win 
13
Myint, the duly elected head of government, were de-
14
posed in a military coup on February 1, 2021. 
15
(4) As part of the military coup, the Burmese 
16
military declared martial law, suspended the civilian- 
17
led government, and detained newly elected Members 
18
of Parliament in the capitol, Naypyidaw, thereby 
19
usurping the role of the democratically elected gov-
20
ernment and parliament. 
21

•HR 1112 IH
sellor Aung San Suu Kyi, President Win Myint, and 
1
other government leaders, Burma is not represented 
2
by a democratically elected government; 
3
(2) the inability of newly elected Members of 
4
Parliament to begin their official mandate due to the 
5
Burmese military’s actions directly threatens the 
6
democratic trajectory of Burma’s Parliament, and 
7
thereby the country; 
8
(3) the will and determination of those duly- 
9
elected Members of Parliament who are taking it 
10
upon themselves to continue serving as representa-
11
tives of the people through alternative methods of 
12
communicating and convening should be lauded; and 
13
(4) by preventing the Parliament from com-
14
pleting its work, the Burmese military has rendered 
15
impossible and effectively nullified the international 
16
collaborative relationships that have supported and 
17
strengthened the institution, including the Burmese 
18
parliament’s partnership with HDP. 
19
