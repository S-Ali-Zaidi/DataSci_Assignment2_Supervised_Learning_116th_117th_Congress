determination of individuals and families who are forced 
to flee their homes due to persecution; 
Whereas December 2020 signified 70 years since the found-
ing of the Office of the United Nations High Commis-
sioner for Refugees (UNHCR); 
Whereas July 28, 2021, is the 70th anniversary of the Con-
vention Relating to the Status of Refugees, held in Gene-
va on July 28, 1951, which defines the term ‘‘refugee’’ 
and outlines the rights of refugees and the legal obliga-
tions of states to protect them; 
Whereas, in 2020, according to the UNHCR— 
(1) there were more than 82,400,000 forcibly dis-
placed people worldwide, the worst displacement crisis in 
recorded history, including 26,400,000 refugees, more 
than 
48,000,000 
internally 
displaced 
people, 
and 
4,100,000 people seeking asylum; 
(2) on average, 1 out of every 95 people worldwide 
was a refugee, an internally displaced person, or a person 
seeking asylum; 
(3) 11,200,000 people were newly displaced due to 
recent conflict or persecution; 
(4) 68 percent of the world’s refugees came from 
Syria, Venezuela, Afghanistan, South Sudan, and Burma; 
(5) 2,600,000 Afghan refugees are currently dis-
placed worldwide, making them one of the world’s largest 
and longest-running displaced populations; 
(6) more than 50 percent of the population of Syria, 
at least 13,500,000 people, were displaced, either across 
the international border or within Syria, which represents 
the largest displacement crisis in the world today; 
(7) children accounted for 30 percent of the world’s 
population but 42 percent of all forcibly displaced people,

millions of whom were unable to access basic services, in-
cluding education; and 
(8) 86 percent of all refugees were hosted by devel-
oping nations, and less than 1 percent of vulnerable refu-
gees in need of resettlement had the opportunity to reset-
tle because sufficient numbers of places do not exist; 
Whereas refugees are major contributors to local economies 
and served as critical frontline health professionals and 
essential workers combating the COVID–19 pandemic 
worldwide; 
Whereas the United States has an obligation to provide hu-
manitarian protection to refugees, as well as interpreters, 
translators, and others in Afghanistan who served along-
side United States and NATO troops, diplomats, and de-
velopment workers; 
Whereas the United States supports the UNHCR to increase 
protection for LGBTQI+ refugees overseas and to sup-
port global resettlement of LGBTQI+ refugees; and 
Whereas the United States resettlement program, which was 
established over 40 years ago, is a lifesaving solution cru-
cial to global humanitarian efforts, strengthens global se-
curity, advances United States foreign policy goals, sup-
ports regional host countries, and assists individuals and 
families in need: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) reaffirms the bipartisan commitment of the

United States to promote the safety, health, and 
3
well-being of millions of refugees, including the edu-
