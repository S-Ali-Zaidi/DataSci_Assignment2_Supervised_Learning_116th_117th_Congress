SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Puerto Rico Statehood 
2
Admission Act’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
The Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) United States national sovereignty in Puer-
6
to Rico was established by the Treaty of Paris be-
7
tween the United States and the Kingdom of Spain 
8
(30 Stat. 1754), signed on December 10, 1898. 
9
(2) Puerto Rico is governed by the United 
10
States under laws enacted by Congress in the exer-
11
cise of its power to make rules and regulations gov-
12
erning territory belonging to the United States, pur-
13
suant to article IV, section 3, clause 2 of the Con-
14
stitution. 
15
(3) For reasons of precedent primarily related 
16
to the Philippines also ceded by Spain after the 
17
Spanish-American War, substantially the same ma-
18
jority in the United States Supreme Court that es-
19
tablished the ‘‘separate but equal’’ doctrine in Plessy 
20
v. Ferguson determined in the 1901 Downes v. 
21
Bidwell decision that Puerto Rico was an unincor-
22
porated territory of the United States, a status of 
23
possession that continues today. 
24
(4) After agreeing to independence for the Phil-
25
ippines, also acquired through the Spanish-American

•HR 1522 IH
War, on March 2, 1917, Congress granted statutory 
1
United States citizenship to the residents of Puerto 
2
Rico. Such action has historically led to incorpora-
3
tion and eventual statehood but was denied to Puer-
4
to Rico due to anomalies emanating from the 1901 
5
Downes ruling and its progeny, even as fellow Amer-
6
icans in Hawaii and Alaska attained statehood. 
7
(5) Puerto Rico has a territorial constitution 
8
that is republican in form and compatible with the 
9
United States Constitution as well as the principles 
10
of the Declaration of Independence, and that is 
11
equivalent to a State constitution, having been 
12
democratically ratified by the United States citizens 
13
of the territory on November 4, 1952, and subse-
14
quently approved by the Congress of the United 
15
States through Public Law 82–447. 
16
(6) Thirty-two territories previously have peti-
17
tioned Congress for statehood based on democrat-
18
ically expressed consent of the governed, and each 
19
was duly admitted as a State of the Union pursuant 
20
to article IV, section 3, clause 1 of the United States 
21
Constitution, with equal rights and responsibilities of 
22
national and State citizenship under the United 
23
States Constitution.

(7) Puerto Ricans have contributed greatly to 
1
the nation and its culture and distinguished them-
2
selves in every field of endeavor. However, the denial 
3
of equal voting representation and equal treatment 
4
by the Federal Government stands in stark contrast 
5
to their contributions. 
6
(8) Since becoming a United States territory, 
7
more than 235,000 American citizens of Puerto 
8
Rican heritage have served in the United States 
9
military. 
10
(9) Thousands of United States military service 
11
members of Puerto Rican heritage have received nu-
12
merous medals, distinctions, and commendations of 
13
every degree, including for valorous military service 
14
in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. 
15
(10) Nine United States military service mem-
16
bers from Puerto Rico have been awarded the Medal 
17
of Honor, and many have been awarded the Distin-
18
guished Service Cross or the Navy Cross. 
19
(11) The 65th Infantry Regiment in Puerto 
20
Rico (known as the ‘‘Borinqueneers’’) was awarded 
21
the Congressional Gold Medal (Public Law 113– 
22
120) for its contributions and sacrifices in the 
23
armed conflicts of the United States, including 
24
World War I, World War II, and the Korean War.

•HR 1522 IH
(12) To further recognize and pay tribute to 
1
the bravery of the Puerto Rican soldiers of the 65th 
2
Infantry Regiment, Congress expressed support for 
3
the 
designation 
of 
April 
13 
as 
National 
4
Borinqueneers Day in the National Defense Author-
5
ization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (Public Law 116– 
6
283). 
7
(13) Unincorporated territory status means 
8
that Federal laws can be applied to Puerto Rico and 
9
its American citizens differently, on unequal and, at 
10
times inequitable terms, compared not only to the 
11
States and their residents, but also unlike territories 
12
that are parts of the United States. This has limited 
13
the development of Puerto Rico and hindered its 
14
economy. 
15
(14) Unincorporated territory status has re-
16
sulted in millions of residents leaving Puerto Rico to 
17
secure equal rights of citizenship attainable only in 
18
a State, and that enable Americans to seek greater 
19
opportunities and a better quality of life in the 
20
States. Approximately 65 percent of all people of 
21
Puerto Rican origin now live in the States, with the 
22
increasing rate of population loss in the territory 
23
creating a severe strain on the local tax base and 
24
workforce participation.

(15) Other than its unincorporated territory 
1
status and its unequal treatment under some Fed-
2
eral laws, Puerto Rico is socially, economically, po-
3
litically, and legally integrated into the nation. Nu-
4
merous territories admitted as States did not have 
5
as strong a record of self-determination favoring 
6
statehood as the majority votes by American citizens 
7
in Puerto Rico favoring admission to the Union. 
8
(16) In November 2012, a majority of voters 
9
rejected continuation of the current territory status, 
10
and 61.2 percent of those expressing a choice on sta-
11
tus alternatives chose statehood. 
12
(17) In June 2017, a vote was held to confirm 
13
the aspirations of the people of Puerto Rico. As ad-
14
vised by the United States Department of Justice, 
15
all available status options were included in the bal-
16
lot. Amid an opposition boycott, statehood received 
17
97 percent of the votes casted, while independence 
18
and the current status received less than 3 percent 
19
of the vote. 
20
(18) In November 2020, following Alaska and 
21
Hawaii precedent, Puerto Rico voters were presented 
22
with the question: ‘‘Should Puerto Rico be admitted 
23
immediately into the Union as a State? Yes or No’’.

A clear majority of 52.52 percent voted in the af-
1
firmative. 
2
(19) In December 2020, the Puerto Rico legis-
3
lature, following the absolute majority victory ob-
4
tained by statehood in the plebiscite, approved a 
5
Joint Resolution petitioning, on behalf of the People 
6
of Puerto Rico, that Congress and the President of 
7
the United States admit Puerto Rico into the Union 
8
as a State and appointed official representatives to 
9
manage the transition to statehood. 
10
(20) No large and populous United States terri-
11
tory inhabited by American citizens that has peti-
12
tioned for statehood has been denied admission into 
13
the Union.
