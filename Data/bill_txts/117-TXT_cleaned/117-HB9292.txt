SECTION 1. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
3
It is the sense of the Congress that— 
4
(1) directing the use of the voice and vote of 
5
the United States at the international financial insti-
6
tutions (IFIs) serves an essential role in promoting 
7
the national interest; 
8
(2) despite their importance, such mandates 
9
have grown to represent a significant compliance

burden for United States representatives at the 
1
IFIs, having accumulated to more than 260 pages of 
2
statutory text over the course of decades-long par-
3
ticipation by the United States in the IFIs; and 
4
(3) while certain mandates provide appropriate 
5
discretion for United States representatives through 
6
waivers and sunset provisions, others may entail in-
7
flexible requirements that— 
8
(A) prevent the representatives from 
9
achieving maximum effectiveness in the pro-
10
motion of United States interests; 
11
(B) render the representatives less relevant 
12
in multilateral negotiations at the IFIs, includ-
13
ing in discussions with United States allies; or 
14
(C) fail to adapt to intervening events and 
15
changing circumstances, thereby undermining 
16
the pursuit of United States interests.
