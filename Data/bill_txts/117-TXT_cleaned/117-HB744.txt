A BILL 
To direct the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Man-
agement Agency to revise the policy of the Agency to 
address the threats of climate change, to include consid-
erations of climate change in the strategic plan of the 
Agency, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘FEMA Climate 
2
Change Preparedness Act’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) Under the previous Administration, the 
6
term ‘‘climate change’’ was intentionally stripped 
7
from the Agency’s 2018–2022 Strategic Plan, de-
8
spite the mounting threat posed by climate change 
9
as a source of changing and increasing national dis-
10
aster risks. 
11
(2) It is the general consensus of the global sci-
12
entific community that— 
13
(A) the evidence of climate change is un-
14
equivocal; 
15
(B) anthropogenic greenhouse gas emis-
16
sions are the primary cause of climate change; 
17
and 
18
(C) as a direct result of climate change, 
19
sea levels are rising and extreme weather events 
20
are becoming more commonplace and severe. 
21
(3) The last 7 years have been the warmest 
22
years on record since the National Oceanic and At-
23
mospheric Administration began recording global air 
24
temperatures in 1895. 
25
01:06 Mar 07, 2021
H744

•HR 744 IH
(4) In 2020, there were a record total of 22 cli-
1
mate disaster events with losses exceeding $1 billion 
2
each to affect the United States—amounting to 5 
3
more disasters of such magnitude than each of the 
4
previous record years of 2011 and 2017. 
5
(5) It is the mission of FEMA to reduce the 
6
loss of life and property and protect our institutions 
7
from all hazards by leading and supporting the Na-
8
tion in a comprehensive, risk-based emergency man-
9
agement program of mitigation, preparedness, re-
10
sponse, and recovery. 
11
(6) It is detrimental to the mission of FEMA, 
12
and the Agency’s ability to follow its mandate, to ex-
13
plicitly or implicitly deny or ignore the existence of 
14
climate change or the implications of such on na-
15
tional security and national emergency management. 
16
(7) To fully and effectively carry out its man-
17
date, FEMA must comprehensively assess and incor-
18
porate the current and future natural disaster risks 
19
and impacts posed by climate change throughout the 
20
Agency’s policies, plans, programs, strategies, and 
21
operations.
