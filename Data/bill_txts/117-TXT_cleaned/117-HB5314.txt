This title may be cited as the ‘‘Congressional Sub-
14
poena Compliance and Enforcement Act’’. 
15
SEC. 402. FINDINGS. 
16
The Congress finds as follows: 
17
(1) As the Supreme Court has repeatedly af-
18
firmed, including in its July 9, 2020, holding in 
19
Trump v. Mazars, Congress’s ‘‘power of inquiry— 
20
with process to enforce it—is an essential and ap-
21
propriate auxiliary to the legislative function’’. 
22
Congress’s power to obtain information, including 
23
through the issuance of subpoenas and the enforce-
24
22:54 Sep 24, 2021
H5314
19 
•HR 5314 IH
ment of such subpoenas, is ‘‘broad and indispen-
1
sable’’. 
2
(2) Congress ‘‘suffers a concrete and particular-
3
ized injury when denied the opportunity to obtain in-
4
formation necessary’’ to the exercise of its constitu-
5
tional functions, as the U.S. Court of Appeals for 
6
the District of Columbia Circuit correctly recognized 
7
in its August 7, 2020, en banc decision in Com-
8
mittee on the Judiciary of the U.S. House of Rep-
9
resentatives v. McGahn. 
10
(3) Accordingly, the Constitution secures to 
11
each House of Congress an inherent right to enforce 
12
its subpoenas in court. Explicit statutory authoriza-
13
tion is not required to secure such a right of action, 
14
and the contrary holding by a divided panel of the 
15
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia 
16
Circuit in McGahn, entered on August 31, 2020, 
17
was in error.
