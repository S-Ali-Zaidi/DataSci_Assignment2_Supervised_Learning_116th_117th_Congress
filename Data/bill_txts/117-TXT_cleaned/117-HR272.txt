lodging details of Federal law enforcement officers; 
Whereas, over the summer of 2020, the Department of 
Homeland Security sent law enforcement personnel to 
protect Federal facilities in Portland, Oregon, after 50 
continuous nights of criminal violence committed by anar-
chists; 
Whereas members of Antifa have physically assaulted a num-
ber of journalists and other individuals during protests, 
peaceful demonstrations, riots, and other political events

messages, and at least two people armed with a handgun 
and knives were arrested; 
Whereas, on January 27, 2021, the Department of Homeland 
Security issued a National Terrorism Advisory System 
Bulletin warned of a heightened threat environment due 
to ‘‘ideologically-motivated extremists with objections to 
the exercise of governmental authority and the presi-

incite or commit violence’’;

acts that appear or intend to intimidate or coerce a civil-
ian population; or acts to affect the conduct of a govern-
ment by mass destruction; and that these activities occur 
primarily within the territorial jurisdiction of the United 
States; 
Whereas there is no place for violence in the disagreements 
between people in the United States; and 
Whereas the diversity of ideas and opinions should be cele-
brated and shared peacefully with one another or dem-
onstrated peacefully through the rights provided in the 
First Amendment of the United States Constitution: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
