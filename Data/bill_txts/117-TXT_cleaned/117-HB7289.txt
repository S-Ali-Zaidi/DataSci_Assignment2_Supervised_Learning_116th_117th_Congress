A BILL 
To provide for the National Academies to study and report 
on a Federal research agenda to advance the under-
standing of PFAS, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Federal PFAS Re-
4
search Evaluation Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl sub-
8
stances (PFAS) are a group of man-made chemicals 
9

that have been used in a wide range of products 
1
since the 1940s including firefighting foam, car-
2
peting, packaging, and cookware. There are more 
3
than 5,000 types of registered PFAS compounds. 
4
This chemical class is not currently regulated at the 
5
Federal level. 
6
(2) PFAS have been detected in air, water, soil, 
7
food, biosolids, and more. They accumulate and re-
8
main in the body for a long time, and can lead to 
9
serious health effects including cancer, low infant 
10
birthweight, liver and kidney issues, reproductive 
11
and developmental problems, and more. 
12
(3) There remains much unknown about PFAS 
13
toxicity, human and environmental health effects, ex-
14
posure pathways, as well as effective removal, treat-
15
ment, and destruction methods, and safe alternatives 
16
to PFAS. 
17
(4) There is currently no cohesive, interagency 
18
effort to address PFAS, and no Federal agency is 
19
focused on a multidisciplinary, cross-sector ap-
20
proach. Rather, there are fragmented efforts at var-
21
ious agencies that have failed to address the full 
22
scope of challenges presented by PFAS. 
23
(5) Regulatory action and cleanup depend on 
24
scientific analysis of toxicity data, decision making

on how best to deal with the thousands of PFAS, 
1
and understanding the significance of the many ex-
2
posure pathways that exist. A consensus study by 
3
the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, 
4
and Medicine would help inform decisions by Federal 
5
and State Governments, industry, and other stake-
6
holders on how to best address PFAS.

standing PFAS exposure and toxicity, shall enter 
18
into an agreement with the National Academies to 
19
conduct a two-phase study and submit reports in ac-

EXPOSURE ESTIMATION.— 
2
(A) IN GENERAL.—The phase I study re-
3
quired to be conducted under paragraph (1) 
4
shall, at a minimum— 
5
(i) consider life-cycle information on 
6
the manufacture, use, and disposal of 
7
PFAS-containing products to identify ex-
8
posure sources and potential exposure 
9
pathways for the public; 
10
(ii) evaluate the fate and transport of 
11
PFAS and their breakdown products; 
12
(iii) if feasible, estimate exposure to 
13
individual or total PFAS to determine rel-
14
ative source contributions for various expo-
15
sure pathways (such as air, water, soil, or 
16
food); 
17
(iv) determine environmentally rel-
18
evant PFAS; and 
19
(v) identify research needed to ad-
20
vance exposure estimation to individual or 
21
total PFAS.
