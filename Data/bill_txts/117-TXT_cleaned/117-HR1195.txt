Whereas June 20, 2022, is observed as ‘‘World Refugee 
Day’’, a global event to honor refugees around the globe 
and celebrate the strengths and courage of people who 
have been forced to flee their home country to escape 
conflict or persecution due to their race, religion, nation-
ality, political opinion, or membership in a particular so-
cial group; 
Whereas July 28, 2022, is the 71st anniversary of the Con-
vention Relating to the Status of Refugees, held in Gene-
va on July 28, 1951, which defines the term ‘‘refugee’’ 
and outlines the rights of refugees and the legal obliga-
tions of States to protect them; 
Whereas, in 2022, according to the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)— 
(1) there are more than 100,000,000 displaced peo-
ple who have been forced from their homes worldwide, 
more than any time in recorded history, including over 
27,100,000 refugees and at least 53,200,000 internally 
displaced people as of the end of 2021; 
(2) 66 percent of the world’s refugees came from 
Syria, Venezuela, Afghanistan, South Sudan, and Burma; 
(3) there have been more than 7,500,000 border 
crossings from Ukraine since February 24, 2022, with 
nearly 5,000,000 having been recorded as refugees across 
Europe as of June 9, 2022, and nearly 12,800,000 peo-
ple were internally displaced in Ukraine as of May 5, 
2022; 
(4) there are 2,700,000 registered Afghan refugees 
in the world, of whom nearly 2,100,000 are registered in 
Iran and Pakistan alone, in addition to another 
3,500,000 people who are internally displaced, having 
fled their homes in search of refuge within the country;

(5) more than 50 percent of the population of Syria, 
at least 13,500,000 people, have been displaced since the 
start of the conflict, either across the international border 
or within Syria, which represents the largest displace-
ment crisis in the world today; 
(6) 1 in 4 people of concern to UNHCR lives in the 
Americas, up from 1 in 6 in 2018; 
(7) over 6,000,000 Venezuelans have fled the coun-
try, representing the largest exodus in Latin America’s 
recent history and one of the largest displacement crises 
in the world; 
(8) children account for 31 percent of the world’s 
population and 41 percent of all forcibly displaced people, 
millions of whom are unable to access basic services, in-
cluding education; and 
(9) 83 percent of all refugees are hosted by devel-
oping nations, and fewer than 1 percent of vulnerable ref-
ugees in need of resettlement have had the opportunity 
due to lack of resettlement places; 
Whereas thousands of immigrant neighbors in the United 
States, including people from Ethiopia, Cameroon, Haiti, 
Mauritania, and South Sudan, face harm if deported to 
their home countries due to violent crime and political in-
stability; 
Whereas refugees are major contributors to local economies 
and serve as critical frontline health care professionals 
and essential workers combating the COVID–19 pan-
demic worldwide; 
Whereas welcoming the oppressed and persecuted is a core 
tenet of this great Nation, and the United States is home 
to a diverse population of refugees and immigrants who

•HRES 1195 IH 
have added to the economic strengths and cultural rich-
ness of United States communities; 
Whereas, consistent with domestic and international law, all 
foreign nationals arriving in the United States, regardless 
of their nationality, must be given an opportunity to seek 
asylum; 
Whereas the United States must restore a humane and func-
tioning asylum system in order to meet its obligations 
under domestic and international law with respect to 
those fleeing persecution; 
Whereas the United States supports the UNHCR in its ef-
forts to increase protection for LGBTQI+ refugees over-
seas and to support their global resettlement; 
Whereas the United States Refugee Admissions Program, 
which was established over 40 years ago, is a lifesaving 
pillar of global humanitarian efforts, advances United 
States foreign policy goals, and supports regional host 
countries; 
Whereas resettlement is an essential part of a comprehensive 
strategy to respond to refugee crises, promote responsi-
bility sharing, and strengthen United States national se-
curity by ensuring access to legal migration pathways; 
Whereas the infrastructure for the United States refugee re-
settlement pipeline has been dismantled, limiting access 
to the United States Refugee Admissions Program glob-
ally; 
Whereas, for the first time in recent history, following the de-
struction of the United States refugee resettlement pipe-
line, large numbers of desperate migrants from as far as 
Cameroon and Ukraine have sought refuge from persecu-
tion at the United States-Mexico border;

•HRES 1195 IH 
Whereas, in fiscal year 2021, the United States only resettled 
11,500 refugees, the lowest figure since the passage of 
the Refugee Act of 1980, and as of May 31, 2022, the 
United States has only resettled 12,641 refugees in fiscal 
year 2022; 
Whereas, as of May 31, 2022, in fiscal year 2022, only 5,070 
refugees were admitted from Africa, only 1,296 from 
Latin America and the Caribbean; and only 1,060 from 
East Asia; 
Whereas resettlement organizations, as well as other commu-
nity and faith-based groups, offer support for refugees 
who resettle in the United States; 
Whereas resettlement to the United States is available for the 
most vulnerable refugees who undergo a rigorous security 
vetting and medical screening process; 
Whereas, according to New American Economy, between 
2005 and 2014, refugees contributed an estimated 
$269,100,000,000 to the national economy, far sur-
passing the $206,100,000,000 spent by the United States 
to assist refugees; and 
Whereas refugees integrate and quickly become self-sufficient 
by paying taxes, supporting local commerce, joining the 
workforce, and creating jobs: Now, therefore, be it
