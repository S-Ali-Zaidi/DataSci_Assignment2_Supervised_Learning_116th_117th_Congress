SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Congress has the responsibility to keep the 
3
populace of the United States safe, and domestic 
4
gun violence is a significant threat to the well-being 
5
of the United States. 
6
(2) Each year in the United States, more than 
7
600 women are shot to death by an intimate part-
8
ner. More women are killed in the United States by 
9
domestic partners than by any other type of assail-
10
ant, and most of these homicides are committed with 
11
firearms. 
12
(3) Approximately 4,500,000 women alive in 
13
the United States today report having been threat-
14
ened with a gun by a domestic partner. 
15
(4) More than half of intimate partner homi-
16
cides in the United States are committed with a fire-
17
arm. If a woman has an abusive male partner who 
18
has access to a firearm, the woman is 5 times more 
19
likely to be killed than she would be if the abusive 
20
male partner did not have access to a firearm, and 
21
domestic violence assaults involving a gun are 12 
22
times more likely to result in death than domestic vi-
23
olence assaults involving other weapons or bodily 
24
force. 
25

•HR 4139 IH
(5) Perpetrators of intimate partner violence 
1
are far more likely to commit additional acts of gun 
2
violence. Nearly half of all mass shooters have com-
3
mitted acts of domestic violence. 
4
(6) Victims of intimate partner violence often 
5
pursue restraining orders as a means of protection 
6
in the immediate aftermath of, or in conjunction 
7
with, leaving dangerous partners and situations. 
8
This time period is especially dangerous for victims. 
9
(7) Although individuals against whom there is 
10
a domestic violence restraining order are barred 
11
from purchasing a firearm under section 922(g)(8) 
12
of title 18, United States Code, various loopholes in 
13
that section allow perpetrators to purchase and 
14
maintain possession of firearms. For example, Fed-
15
eral law only protects domestic violence victims 
16
against spouses, former spouses, cohabitants, former 
17
cohabitants, and individuals with whom those vic-
18
tims have a child. Furthermore, under Federal law, 
19
protective orders issued against domestic violence 
20
abusers on an emergency or ex parte basis do not 
21
prohibit those abusers from possessing or purchasing 
22
firearms. 
23
(8) Some States and local governments have 
24
passed laws that go beyond the Federal baseline by 
25
03:43 Jul 10, 2021

•HR 4139 IH
expanding the range of abusive partners included in 
1
firearm restrictions to encompass abusive dating 
2
partners. Numerous studies conducted between 2000 
3
and 2017 have shown that States that pass these 
4
laws experience a significant reduction in intimate 
5
partner homicides. 
6
(9) States that restrict access to guns to indi-
7
viduals subject to active domestic violence restrain-
8
ing orders have experienced a 13-percent reduction 
9
in intimate partner homicides involving firearms. 
10
(10) Congress has the power to set a national 
11
standard to protect domestic violence victims who 
12
seek restraining orders against abusive partners by 
13
preventing those abusive partners from possessing or 
14
purchasing firearms and ammunition while the re-
15
straining order is in effect.
