RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the designation of October 2022 as 
‘‘National Youth Justice Action Month’’. 
Whereas the historical role of the juvenile court system is to 
rehabilitate and treat young people while holding them 
accountable and maintaining public safety, and the juve-
nile court system is therefore better equipped to work 
with youth than the adult criminal justice system, which 
is punitive in nature; 
Whereas youth are developmentally different from adults, and 
those differences have been— 
(1) documented by research on the adolescent brain; 
and 
(2) acknowledged by the Supreme Court of the 
United States, State supreme courts, and many State

and Federal laws that prohibit youth under the age of 18 
from taking on major adult responsibilities such as vot-
ing, jury duty, and military service; 
Whereas youth who are placed under the commitment of the 
juvenile court system often do not receive access to age- 
appropriate services and education and remain far from 
their families, which increases the likelihood that those 
youth will commit offenses in the future; 
Whereas every year in the United States, an estimated 
53,000 youths are tried, sentenced, or incarcerated as 
adults, and most of those youth are prosecuted for non-
violent offenses; 
Whereas most laws allowing the prosecution of youth as 
adults were enacted before the publication of research- 
based evidence by the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention and the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delin-
quency Prevention of the Department of Justice dem-
onstrating that prosecuting youth in adult court actually 
decreases public safety as, on average, youth prosecuted 
in adult court are 34 percent more likely to commit fu-
ture crimes than youth retained in the juvenile court sys-
tem; 
Whereas youth of color, youth with disabilities, and youth 
with mental health issues are disproportionately rep-
resented at all stages of the criminal justice system; 
Whereas it is harmful to public safety and to young people 
in the legal system to confine youth in adult jails or pris-
ons where they are significantly more likely to be phys-
ically and sexually assaulted and often placed in solitary 
confinement;

Whereas youth sentenced as adults receive an adult criminal 
record that hinders future education and employment op-
portunities; 
Whereas youth who receive extremely long sentences deserve 
an opportunity to demonstrate their potential to grow 
and change; and 
Whereas in October, people around the United States partici-
pate in Youth Justice Action Month to increase public 
awareness on the need to protect the constitutional rights 
of youth, establish a minimum age for arresting children, 
remove youth from adult courts and prisons, end the 
practice of sentencing children to life imprisonment with-
out parole and consecutive sentences that amount to de 
facto life imprisonment without parole, and to provide 
people across the United States with an opportunity to 
develop action-oriented events in their communities: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) acknowledges that the collateral con-

sequences normally applied in the adult criminal jus-

tice system should not automatically apply to youth

arrested for crimes before the age of 18;
