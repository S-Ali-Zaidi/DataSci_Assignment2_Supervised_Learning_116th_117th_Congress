SHIP PROGRAMS THAT ASSIST VETERANS.

(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the Sense of Con-
4
gress that— 
5
(1) the COVID–19 pandemic and other factors 
6
have contributed to a growing backlog of veterans 
7
needing medical disability examinations and opin-
8
ions; 
9
(2) access to medical disability examinations 
10
and opinions is critical for veterans to receive dis-
11
ability compensation benefits from the Department 
12
of Veterans Affairs; 
13
(3) there remains a need to train non-Depart-
14
ment of Veterans Affairs clinicians to understand 
15
and support the unique medical needs of disabled 
16
veterans; 
17
(4) veterans who are dissatisfied with medical 
18
disability examinations or opinions provided by em-
19
ployees or contractors of the Department of Vet-
20
erans Affairs may obtain and submit outside, inde-
21
pendent disability evaluations; however, most vet-
22
erans cannot afford to obtain such evaluations and 
23
most non-Department training clinicians are not fa-
24
miliar with the specific legal criteria and medical

findings necessary to prepare adequate disability ex-
1
amination reports and opinions; and 
2
(5) clinics within non-Department of Veterans 
3
Affairs medical residency and fellowship programs 
4
are a potential resource to supplement the current 
5
medical disability examination and opinion system 
6
carried out by employees and contractors of the De-
7
partment by— 
8
(A) affording disabled veterans with an-
9
other option for high-quality, outside, inde-
10
pendent disability evaluations; and 
11
(B) providing non-Department clinicians 
12
with clinical training and experience necessary 
13
to understand the unique medical needs of dis-
14
abled veterans. 
15
(b) STUDY REQUIRED.—The Secretary of Veterans 
16
Affairs shall conduct a study to assess the feasibility and 
17
advisability of— 
18
(1) establishing the pilot program described in 
19

21

22
such program.
