INFLUENCE 
OPERATIONS

WITHIN 
THE

NA-

TIONS SYSTEM 
4
SEC. 101. FINDINGS. 
5
Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) Article 100 of the United Nations Charter 
7
provides that United Nations Secretariat staff ‘‘shall 
8
not seek or receive instructions from any govern-
9
ment or from any authority external to the Organi-
10
zation’’. 
11
(2) Furthermore, it requires Member States to 
12
‘‘respect the exclusively international character of 
13
the responsibilities of the Secretary-General and the 
14
staff and not to seek to influence them in the dis-
15
charge of their responsibilities’’. 
16
(3) For decades, Russia has manipulated the 
17
United Nations procurement process to its own ben-
18
efit, especially in air assets. Russian nationals in key 
19
procurement and personnel positions inside the 
20
United Nations have repeatedly drafted procurement 
21
contracts designed to ensure that Russian airframes 
22
and pilots have an unfair advantage when bidding 
23
for these contracts.

•HR 4775 IH
(4) According to Human Rights Watch, the 
1
People’s Republic of China (PRC) has used its lead-
2
ership roles within the United Nations to block non-
3
governmental organizations critical of the PRC from 
4
being accredited to the UN. PRC diplomats have 
5
violated UN rules by harassing activists by 
6
photographing and filming them on UN property, as 
7
well as contacting UN employees in efforts to intimi-
8
date and harass them. 
9
(5) In 2013, PRC authorities detained Cao 
10
Shunli after she tried to attend trainings in Geneva 
11
on the Human Rights Council. She was arrested at 
12
Beijing Airport and disappeared for several weeks. 
13
She had previously called on the Chinese Communist 
14
Party to work with civil society during the drafting 
15
of the PRC’s second Universal Periodic Review, a 
16
mechanism by which the UN Human Rights Council 
17
reviews the human rights record of Member States. 
18
After five and a half months in detention, she died 
19
in a military hospital in Beijing. When NGOs at the 
20
Human Rights Council called for a moment of si-
21
lence in memory of Cao, the PRC delegation blocked 
22
the request. 
23
(6) In a 2019 interview with China Central Tel-
24
evision, Wu Hongbo, the former Under-Secretary- 
25
05:14 Aug 07, 2021
H4775
6 
•HR 4775 IH
General of the United Nations and head of the 
1
United Nations Department of Economic and Social 
2
Affairs (UNDESA), stated publicly that as a United 
3
Nations Employee, he prioritized the PRC’s inter-
4
ests above the impartiality of the United Nations 
5
System. When discussing how he demanded the 
6
United Nations police expel Dolkun Isa, an accred-
7
ited nongovernmental organization (NGO) partici-
8
pant, from the United Nations headquarters, Wu 
9
Hongbo described him as a ‘‘Xinjiang separatist’’ 
10
and bragged about intimidating an Assistant Sec-
11
retary-General who complained. He went on to say 
12
‘‘I think being a Chinese diplomat means one can’t 
13
be careless, when it is about protecting China’s na-
14
tional interest and safety. We have to strongly de-
15
fend the motherland’s interests.’’. 
16
(7) Despite this action, Wu Hongbo was suc-
17
ceeded as Under-Secretary-General and head of 
18
UNDESA by Liu Zhenmin, another PRC national. 
19
Under-Secretary-General Liu continues to prioritize 
20
PRC national interests above the impartiality re-
21
quired in his role. 
22
(8) On September 19, 2019, the United States 
23
Department of State expelled two members of the 
24
Permanent Mission of Cuba to the United Nations

18
(1) As underscored by repeated revelations of

waste, fraud, and abuse, oversight and account-
20
ability mechanisms within the United Nations sys-
21
tem remain deficient, despite decades of reform at-

(2) Notwithstanding the personal intentions of 
1
any Secretary General of the United Nations to pro-
2
mote institutional transparency and accountability 
3
within the United Nations System, the Secretary 
4
General lacks the power to impose far reaching man-
5
agement reforms without the concurrence of the 
6
General Assembly. 
7
(3) The United Nations Office of Internal Over-
8
sight Services (OIOS) is tasked with providing 
9
transparency and accountability to Member States. 
10
(4) The United States successfully led efforts 
11
within the General Assembly to expand OIOS, re-
12
sulting in increased independence of the office and 
13
an enhanced ability to expose fraud, waste, abuse, 
14
and other misconduct. 
15
(5) However, to an unacceptable degree, major

donor states, including the United States, lack ac-
17
cess to reasonably detailed, reliable information on

the use of funding made available through single- 
19
