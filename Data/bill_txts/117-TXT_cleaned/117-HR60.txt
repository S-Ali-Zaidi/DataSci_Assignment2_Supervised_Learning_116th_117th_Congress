•HRES 60 IH 
Whereas Congress must continue to morally object to the es-
tablishment of Roe v. Wade on January 22, 1973, and 
mourns the over 60,000,000 lives lost since the legaliza-
tion of abortion in the United States; and 
Whereas 70 percent of Americans, including nearly half who 
identify as pro-choice, want significant restrictions on 
abortion: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) recognizes the heroic work of pregnancy 
2
care centers in our communities in their endeavors 
3
to support mothers as they choose life, and the child 
4
after they are born; 
5
(2) supports the designation of ‘‘National Sanc-
6
tity of Life Day’’; and 
7
(3) reaffirms the commitment to safeguard the 
8
precious gift of life at every stage, from conception 
9
to natural death.
