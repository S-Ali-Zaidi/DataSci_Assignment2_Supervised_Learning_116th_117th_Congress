RESOLUTION 
Affirming the role of the United States in improving access 
to quality, inclusive public education and improved learn-
ing outcomes for children and adolescents, particularly 
for girls, in the poorest countries through the Global 
Partnership for Education. 
Whereas access to quality education reduces poverty, ad-
vances economic prosperity, improves peace and security, 
and strengthens public health; 
Whereas the United Nations reported that 1,600,000,000 
learners in more than 190 countries were affected by the

closure of educational institutions at the peak of the 
COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas prior to the COVID crisis, the 2020 Global Edu-
cation Monitoring Report, an annual accountability tool 
on the status of education internationally, found that an 
estimated 258,000,000 children and adolescents are out 
of school worldwide, with girls and children with disabil-
ities more likely to be out of school in most of the devel-
oping world; 
Whereas a 2019 UNICEF Report found that only one in 
every five children in low-income countries has access to 
preprimary education; 
Whereas a 2019 World Bank Report found that more than 
half of all children in low- and middle-income countries 
cannot read a simple story by age 10; 
Whereas a 2020 UNESCO Global Education Monitoring Re-
port found that children and adolescents with a sensory, 
physical, or intellectual disability are two and a half 
times more likely to have never been in school than their 
peers without disabilities; 
Whereas a 2018 UNICEF Report found that one in three 
children and adolescents are out of school in countries af-
fected by conflict or disaster; 
Whereas a 2020 UNHCR Report found that almost half of 
school-age refugee children are out of school and, of the 
refugee children who do start primary school, less than 
half make it to secondary school; 
Whereas a 2018 World Bank Report found that 12 years of 
quality education for every girl would boost economies by 
as much as $30 trillion in increased lifetime earnings and 
that each year of secondary education for girls reduces

the likelihood of marriage before the age of 18 by five 
percentage points or more; 
Whereas the Global Partnership for Education (GPE) was 
founded in 2002 as the only public-private global partner-
ship exclusively dedicated to education in the world’s 
poorest countries; 
Whereas GPE-eligible countries are home to more than 
1,000,000,000 children and adolescents, which represent 
82 percent of out-of-school children; 
Whereas GPE focuses on improving education at a systems 
level, aligning partners behind each government’s edu-
cation sector plan, to leverage the profound trans-
formations required to deliver at least one year of pre-
school and 12 years of quality education for every child; 
Whereas GPE works in the countries with the greatest need, 
targets the hardest to reach children, and can respond 
quickly to emergencies; 
Whereas educational continuity helps partners keep their edu-
cation systems functioning through wars, displacement 
crises, climate disasters and health emergencies, includ-
ing the ongoing COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas GPE is a proven and effective aid delivery mecha-
nism that complements the United States Government’s 
bilateral basic education programs by fostering coordina-
tion among all key partners, supporting the development 
and implementation of strong national education sector 
plans, and building on the commitment of developing 
country governments to expand quality educational op-
portunities for children in an equitable manner; 
Whereas the United States is among the leading supporters 
of GPE, is represented on the GPE Board of Directors,

and currently serves the critical role of Coordinating 
Agent in eight GPE partner countries; 
Whereas United States Government Strategy on Basic Edu-
cation, Fiscal Years 2019 through 2023, resolves to le-
verage GPE to advance its goal of achieving a world 
where education systems in partner countries enable all 
individuals to acquire the education and skills needed to 
be productive members of society; 
Whereas GPE is working with Education Cannot Wait, at 
global and country level, to develop optimized approaches 
to advance UN Sustainable Development Goal 4 and pro-
vide inclusive and equitable quality education for all, es-
pecially the most marginalized children in crisis situa-
tions; 
Whereas primary enrollment for girls has increased by 65 
percent and almost three-quarters of partner countries 
have achieved gender parity in school completion; 
Whereas in 40 percent of partner countries, GPE’s partner-
ship supports one or more activities relating to children 
with disabilities; 
Whereas GPE is the largest provider of education grants in 
the 
global 
COVID–19 
response, 
mobilizing 
over 
$500,000,000 to ensure continued learning, school re-
openings, and recovery; 
Whereas GPE support incentivized governments to save more 
than $6,000,000,000 through more efficient education 
spending, freeing up more funds to invest in education 
for the most marginalized; 
Whereas more than 60 percent of GPE’s spending is in coun-
tries affected by conflict or fragility, and GPE helped 
these countries to increase their primary school comple-

tion rates from 58 percent in 2002 to 68 percent in 
2018; 
Whereas GPE’s 5-year strategic plan calls for leveraging and 
further developing innovative finance mechanisms to get 
every child learning, and extends a strong commitment to 
gender equality and inclusion across all workings of the 
partnership, including a new funding window that will 
raise an additional $250,000,000 for girls’ education; and 
Whereas with support from donors, GPE will enable 
175,000,000 primary-age children to learn, reach 
140,000,000 students with professionally trained teach-
ers, get 88,000,000 more children in school, more than 
half of them girls, and save $16,000,000,000 through 
more efficient spending: Now, therefore, be it
