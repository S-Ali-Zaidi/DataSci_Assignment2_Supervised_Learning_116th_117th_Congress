A BILL 
To provide that the Administrator of the National Oceanic 
and Atmospheric Administration shall not issue an in-
terim or final rule that includes an area closure in the

the data related to that study is integrated into the 
stock assessment.

SECTION 1. CONDITIONS FOR RULES RELATED TO CER-
1
TAIN AREA CLOSURES. 
2
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
3
(1) Fishing is a major economic driver in the 
4
South Atlantic. In Florida alone, recreational an-
5
glers provide $14,000,000,000 in economic output 
6
and support 119,000 jobs. 
7
(2) Red snapper is a highly prized and sought 
8
after reef fish by both recreational and commercial 
9
fishermen. 
10
(3) The 6-day recreational red snapper season 
11
in 2018 added $13,000,000 to the gross domestic 
12
product of the South Atlantic region. 
13
(4) For the last 10 years, fishery managers 
14
have successfully been working to rebuild the red 
15
snapper stock in the South Atlantic. There is cur-
16
rently record high abundance and strong recruit-
17
ment within the stock. 
18
(5) This record abundance has led to increased 
19
out-of-season encounters and discards which is driv-
20
ing red snapper mortality. 
21
(6) Despite these increased discards, it is the 
22
overriding opinion of the South Atlantic Fishery 
23
Management Council’s Snapper Grouper Advisory 
24
Panel that based on members’ collective on-the-water 
25
experience, the red snapper fishery is recovered.

(7) However, options for future consideration to 
1
reduce out-of-season encounters and red snapper 
2
mortalities include shorter seasons and broad area 
3
closures for the snapper-grouper fishery in the South 
4
Atlantic. 
5
(8) The State of Florida is concerned with the 
6
economic implications of area closures for the South 
7
Atlantic snapper-grouper recreational fishery. 
8
(9) $5,100,000 has been invested in inde-
9
pendent survey data over the last three fiscal years, 
10
including $3,300,000 for the South Atlantic Great 
11
Red Snapper Count to estimate the number of red 
12
snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) in the South At-
13
lantic waters from North Carolina to Florida. 
14
(10) The National Marine Fisheries Service 
15
should incorporate data from this survey into the 
16
National Marine Fisheries Service stock assessments 
17
as expeditiously as possible to better inform fishery 
18
management decisions. 
19
(b) CONDITION ON ISSUANCE OF RULE.—The Ad-
20
ministrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Ad-
21
ministration shall not issue an interim or final rule that 
22
includes an area closure in the South Atlantic for species 
23
managed under the Snapper-Grouper Fishery Manage-
24
ment Plan until—

(1) the South Atlantic Great Red Snapper

Count study is complete; and

(2) the data related to that study is integrated

into the upcoming South Atlantic red snapper re-
4
search track and operational stock assessment.
