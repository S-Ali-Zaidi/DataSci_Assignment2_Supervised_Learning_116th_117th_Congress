This title may be cited as the ‘‘Creating Schedule F

in the Excepted Service Act’’.

SEC. 102. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) To effectively carry out the broad array of 
8
activities assigned to the executive branch under law, 
9
the President and his appointees must rely on men 
10
and women in the Federal service employed in posi-
11
tions of a confidential, policy-determining, policy- 
12
making, or policy-advocating character. Faithful exe-
13
cution of the law requires that the President have 
14
appropriate management oversight regarding this se-
15
lect cadre of professionals. 
16
(2) The Federal Government benefits from ca-
17
reer professionals in positions that are not normally 
18
subject to change as a result of a Presidential tran-
19
sition but who discharge significant duties and exer-
20
cise significant discretion in formulating and imple-
21
menting executive branch policy and programs under 
22
the laws of the United States. The heads of execu-
23
tive departments and agencies (agencies) and the 
24
American people also entrust these career profes-
25
04:14 Mar 18, 2022
H7095

•HR 7095 IH
sionals with non-public information that must be 
1
kept confidential. 
2
(3) With the exception of attorneys in the Fed-
3
eral service who are appointed pursuant to schedule 
4
A of the excepted service and members of the Senior 
5
Executive Service, appointments to these positions 
6
are generally made through the competitive service. 
7
Given the importance of the functions they dis-
8
charge, employees in such positions must display ap-
9
propriate temperament, acumen, impartiality, and 
10
sound judgment. 
11
(4) Due to these requirements, agencies should 
12
have a greater degree of appointment flexibility with 
13
respect to these employees than is afforded by the 
14
existing competitive service process. 
15
(5) Further, effective performance management 
16
of employees in confidential, policy-determining, pol-
17
icy-making, or policy-advocating positions is of the 
18
utmost importance. Unfortunately, the Government’s 
19
current performance management is inadequate, as 
20
recognized by Federal workers themselves. For in-
21
stance, the 2016 Merit Principles Survey reveals 
22
that less than a quarter of Federal employees believe 
23
their agency addresses poor performers effectively. 
24

H7095

•HR 7095 IH
(6) Separating employees who cannot or will 
1
not meet required performance standards is impor-
2
tant, and it is particularly important with regard to 
3
employees in confidential, policy-determining, policy- 
4
making, or policy-advocating positions. High per-
5
formance by such employees can meaningfully en-
6
hance agency operations, while poor performance 
7
can significantly hinder them. Senior agency officials 
8
report that poor performance by career employees in 
9
policy-relevant positions has resulted in long delays 
10
and substandard-quality work for important agency 
11
projects, such as drafting and issuing regulations. 
12
(7) Conditions of good administration make 
13
necessary an exception to the competitive hiring 
14
rules and examinations for career positions in the 
15
Federal service of a confidential, policy-determining, 
16
policy-making, or policy-advocating character. These 
17
conditions include the need to provide agency heads 
18
with additional flexibility to assess prospective ap-
19
pointees without the limitations imposed by competi-
20
tive service selection procedures. Placing these posi-
21
tions in the excepted service will mitigate undue lim-
22
itations on their selection. This action will also give 
23
agencies greater ability and discretion to assess crit-
24
ical qualities in applicants to fill these positions, 
25
04:14 Mar 18, 2022
H7095
6 
•HR 7095 IH
such as work ethic, judgment, and ability to meet 
1
the particular needs of the agency. These are all 
2
qualities individuals should have before wielding the 
3
authority inherent in their prospective positions, and 
4
agencies should be able to assess candidates without 
5
proceeding through complicated and elaborate com-
6
petitive service processes or rating procedures that 
7
do not necessarily reflect their particular needs. 
8
(8) Conditions of good administration similarly 
9
make necessary excepting such positions from the 
10
adverse action procedures set forth in chapter 75 of 
11
title 5, United States Code. Chapter 75 of title 5, 
12
United States Code, requires agencies to comply 
13
with extensive procedures before taking adverse ac-
14
tion against an employee. These requirements can 
15
make removing poorly performing employees dif-
16
ficult. Only a quarter of Federal supervisors are con-
17
fident that they could remove a poor performer. Ca-
18
reer employees in confidential, policy-determining, 
19
policy-making, and policy-advocating positions wield 
20
significant influence over Government operations 
21
and effectiveness. Agencies need the flexibility to ex-
22
peditiously remove poorly performing employees 
23
from these positions without facing extensive delays 
24
or litigation.

19
SEC. 202. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

holding Federal employees accountable for perform-
23
ance and conduct.

(2) They state that employees should maintain 
1
high standards of integrity, conduct, and concern for 
2
the public interest, and that the Federal workforce 
3
should be used efficiently and effectively. They fur-
4
ther state that employees should be retained based 
5
on the adequacy of their performance, inadequate 
6
performance should be corrected, and employees 
7
should be separated who cannot or will not improve 
8
their performance to meet required standards. 
9
(3) Unfortunately, implementation of America’s 
10
civil service laws has fallen far short of these ideals. 
11
(4) The Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey 
12
has consistently found that less than one-third of 
13
Federal employees believe that the Government deals 
14
with poor performers effectively. 
15
(5) Failure to address unacceptable perform-
16
ance and misconduct undermines morale, burdens 
17
good performers with subpar colleagues, and inhibits 
18
the ability of any agency to accomplish their mis-
19
sions. 
20
(6) This title advances the ability of supervisors 
21
in agencies to promote civil servant accountability 
22
consistent with merit system principles while simul-
23
taneously recognizing employees’ procedural rights

and protections.

SEC. 203. PRINCIPLES FOR ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE FED-
1
ERAL WORKFORCE. 
2
In managing the Federal workforce, and in addition 
3
to the other requirements of this title, each agency shall, 
4
to the greatest extent practicable, adhere to and carry out 
5
the following principles: 
6
(1) Removing unacceptable performers should 
7
be a straightforward process that minimizes the bur-
8
den on supervisors. Agencies shall limit opportunity 
9
periods to demonstrate acceptable performance 
10
under section 4302(c)(6) of title 5, United States 
11
Code, to the amount of time that provides sufficient 
12
opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance. 
13
(2) Supervisors and deciding officials shall not 
14
be required to use progressive discipline. The penalty 
15
for an instance of misconduct should be tailored to 
16
the facts and circumstances. 
17
(3) Each employee’s work performance and dis-
18
ciplinary history is unique, and disciplinary action 
19
should be calibrated to the specific facts and cir-
20
cumstances of each individual employee’s situation. 
21
Conduct that justifies discipline of one employee at 
22
one time does not necessarily justify similar dis-
23
cipline of a different employee at a different time— 
24
particularly where the employees are in different 
25
work units or chains of supervision—and agencies 
26
04:14 Mar 18, 2022
H7095
18 
•HR 7095 IH
are not prohibited from removing an employee sim-
1
ply because they did not remove a different employee 
2
for comparable conduct. Nonetheless, employees 
3
should be treated equitably, so agencies should con-
4
sider appropriate comparators as they evaluate po-
5
tential disciplinary actions. 
6
(4) Suspension should not be a substitute for 
7
removal in circumstances in which removal would be 
8
appropriate. Agencies should not require suspension 
9
of an employee before proposing to remove that em-
10
ployee, except as may be appropriate under applica-
11
ble facts. 
12
(5) When taking disciplinary action, agencies 
13
should have discretion to take into account an em-
14
ployee’s disciplinary record and past work record, in-
15
cluding all past misconduct—not only similar past 
16
misconduct. Agencies should provide an employee 
17
with appropriate notice when taking a disciplinary 
18
action. 
19
(6) To the extent practicable, agencies should 
20
issue decisions on proposed removals taken under 
21
chapter 75 of title 5, United States Code, within 15 
22
business days of the end of the employee reply pe-
23
riod following a notice of proposed removal.

(7) To the extent practicable, agencies should 
1
limit the written notice of adverse action to the 30 
2
days prescribed in section 7513(b)(1) of title 5, 
3
United States Code. 
4
(8) The removal procedures set forth in chapter 
5
75 of title 5, United States Code, should be used in 
6
appropriate cases to address instances of unaccept-
7

TITLE III—UNION TIME

SEC. 301. SHORT TITLE. 
4
This title may be cited as the ‘‘Ensuring Trans-
5
parency, Accountability, and Efficiency in Taxpayer- 
6
Funded Federal Union Time Use Act’’. 
7
SEC. 302. PURPOSES. 
8
The purposes of this title are as follows: 
9
(1) An effective and efficient government keeps 
10
careful track of how it spends the taxpayers’ money 
11
and eliminates unnecessary, inefficient, or unreason-
12
able expenditures. To advance this policy, executive 
13
branch employees should spend their duty hours per-
14
forming the work of the Federal Government and 
15
serving the public. 
16
(2) Federal law allows Federal employees to 
17
represent labor organizations and perform other 
18
non-agency business while being paid by American 
19
taxpayers (taxpayer-funded union time). The Con-
20
gress, however, has also instructed the executive 
21
branch to interpret the law in a manner consistent 
22
with the requirements of an effective and efficient 
23
government. 
24
04:14 Mar 18, 2022
H7095
28 
•HR 7095 IH
(3) To that end, agencies should ensure that 
1
taxpayer-funded union time is used efficiently and 
2
authorized in amounts that are reasonable, nec-
3
essary, and in the public interest. Federal employees 
4
should spend the clear majority of their duty hours 
5
working for the public. No agency should pay for 
6
Federal labor organizations’ expenses, except where 
7
required by law. Agencies should eliminate unre-
8
stricted grants of taxpayer-funded union time and 
9
instead require employees to obtain specific author-
10
ization before using such time. Agencies should also 
11
monitor use of taxpayer-funded union time, ensure it 
12
is used only for authorized purposes, and make in-
13
formation regarding its use readily available to the 
14
public.

Such procedure shall, at a minimum, require a requesting 
10
employee to specify the number of taxpayer-funded union 
11
time hours to be used and the specific purposes for which 
12
such time will be used, providing sufficient detail to iden-
13
tify the tasks the employee will undertake. That procedure 
14
shall also allow the authorizing official to assess whether 
15
it is reasonable, necessary, and in the public interest to 
16
grant such amount of time to accomplish such tasks. For 
17
continuing or ongoing requests, each agency shall require 
18
requests for authorization renewals to be submitted not 
19
less than once per pay period. Each agency shall further 
20

(a) IN GENERAL.—Each agency shall implement the 
11
requirements of this title not later than 45 days after the 
12
date of enactment of this Act, except for section 305(b), 
13
which shall be effective for employees at an agency when

11
SEC. 401. SHORT TITLE. 
12
This title may be cited as the ‘‘Developing Efficient, 
13
Effective, and Cost-Reducing Approaches to Federal Sec-
14
tor Collective Bargaining Act’’. 
15
SEC. 402. FINDINGS. 
16
Congress finds the following: 
17
(1) Section 7101(b) of title 5, United States 
18
Code, requires the Federal Service Labor-Manage-
19
ment Relations Statute (in this section referred to as 
20
the ‘‘Statute’’) to be interpreted in a manner con-
21
sistent with the requirement of an effective and effi-
22
cient Government. Unfortunately, implementation of 
23
the Statute has fallen short of these goals. CBAs 
24
and other agency agreements with collective bar-
25
04:14 Mar 18, 2022
H7095
45 
•HR 7095 IH
gaining representatives often make it harder for 
1
agencies to reward high performers, hold low per-
2
formers accountable, or flexibly respond to oper-
3
ational needs. Many agencies and collective bar-
4
gaining representatives spend years renegotiating 
5
CBAs, with taxpayers paying for both sides’ nego-
6
tiators. Agencies must also engage in prolonged ne-
7
gotiations before making even minor operational 
8
changes, like relocating office space. 
9
(2) The Federal Government must do more to 
10
apply the Statute in a manner consistent with effec-
11
tive and efficient Government. 
12
(3) To fulfill this obligation, agencies should se-
13
cure CBAs that— 
14
(A) promote an effective and efficient 
15
means of accomplishing agency missions; 
16
(B) encourage the highest levels of em-
17
ployee performance and ethical conduct; 
18
(C) ensure employees are accountable for 
19
their conduct and performance on the job; 
20
(D) expand agency flexibility to address 
21
operational needs; 
22
(E) reduce the cost of agency operations, 
23
including with respect to the use of taxpayer- 
24
funded union time;

(F) are consistent with applicable laws, 
1
rules, and regulations; 
2
(G) do not cover matters that are not, by 
3
law, subject to bargaining; and 
4
(H) preserve management rights under 
5
section 7106(a) of title 5, United States Code. 
6
(4) Further, agencies that form part of an ef-
7
fective and efficient Government should not take 
8
more than a year to renegotiate CBAs.

negotiating efforts, including the submissions re-
11
quired under section 409 of this title, and creating 
12
an inventory of language on significant subjects of 
13
bargaining that have relevance to more than one

18
reasonable limits for good-faith negotiations, call for 
19
the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service to 
20

report shall recommend new or revised CBA language the 
1
agency could seek to include in a renegotiated agreement 
2
that would better support the objectives of section 402 of 
3
this title. The officials preparing the report shall consider 
4
the analysis and advice of the Labor Relations Group in 
5
making recommendations for revisions. These reports 
6
shall be deemed guidance and advice for agency manage-
7
ment related to collective bargaining under section 
8

9
subject to disclosure to the exclusive representative or its 
10
authorized representative.

(b) CBA NEGOTIATION REQUIREMENTS.—Consistent 
12
with the requirements and provisions of chapter 71 of title 
13
5, United States Code, and other applicable laws and reg-
14
ulations, an agency, when negotiating with a collective 
15
bargaining representative, shall— 
16
(1) establish collective bargaining objectives 
17
that advance the policies of section 402 of this title, 
18
with such objectives informed, as appropriate, by the 
19
reports required by subsection (a) of this section;

22
tive bargaining objectives and when evaluating col-
23
lective bargaining representative proposals;

6
(a) IN GENERAL.—To achieve the purposes of this 
7
title, agencies shall begin collective bargaining negotia-
8
tions by making their best effort to negotiate ground rules 
9
that minimize delay, set reasonable time limits for good- 
10
faith negotiations, call for Federal Mediation and Concilia-
11
tion Service mediation of disputed issues not resolved 
12
within those time limits, and, as appropriate, promptly 
13
bring remaining unresolved issues to the Panel for resolu-
14
tion. For collective bargaining negotiations, a negotiating 
15
period of six weeks or less to achieve ground rules, and 
16
a negotiating period of between four and six months for 
17
a CBA under those ground rules, shall ordinarily be con-
18
sidered reasonable and to satisfy the goal set forth in sec-
19
tion 402(3)(A) of this title. Agencies shall commit the time 
20
and resources necessary to satisfy these temporal objec-
21
tives and to fulfill their obligation to bargain in good faith.

Any negotiations to establish ground rules that do not con-
23

(b) NEGOTIATIONS DEADLINES.—During any collec-
1
tive bargaining negotiations under chapter 71 of title 5, 
2
United States Code, and consistent with section 7114(b) 
3
of that chapter, the agency shall negotiate in good faith 
4
to reach agreement on a CBA, memorandum of under-
5
standing, or any other type of binding agreement that pro-
6
motes the policies outlined in section 402 of this title. If 
7
such negotiations last longer than the period established 
8
by the CBA ground rules—or, absent a preset deadline, 
9
a reasonable time—the agency shall consider whether re-
10
questing assistance from the Federal Mediation and Con-
11
ciliation Service and, as appropriate, the Panel, would bet-
12
ter promote effective and efficient Government than would 
13
continuing negotiations. Such consideration should evalu-
14
ate the likelihood that continuing negotiations without 
15
Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service assistance or 
16
referral to the Panel would produce an agreement con-
17
sistent with the goals of section 402 of this title, as well 
18
as the cost to the public of continuing to pay for both 
19
agency and collective bargaining representative negoti-
20
ating teams. Upon the conclusion of the sixth month of 
21
any negotiation, the agency head shall receive notice from 
22
appropriate agency staff and shall receive monthly notifi-
23
cations thereafter regarding the status of negotiations 
24
until they are complete. The agency head shall notify the

•HR 7095 IH
President through the Office of Personnel Management of 
1
any negotiations that have lasted longer than nine months, 
2
in which the assistance of the Federal Mediation and Con-
3
ciliation Service either has not been requested or, if re-
4
quested, has not resulted in agreement or advancement 
5
to the Panel. 
6
(c) FAILURE TO NEGOTIATE IN GOOD FAITH.—If 
7
the commencement or any other stage of bargaining is de-
8
layed or impeded because of a collective bargaining rep-
9
resentative’s failure to comply with the duty to negotiate 
10
in good faith pursuant to section 7114(b) of title 5, United 
11
States Code, the agency shall consider whether to— 
12
(1) file an unfair labor practice complaint under 
13
section 7118 of title 5, United States Code, after 
14
considering evidence of bad-faith negotiating, includ-
15
ing refusal to meet to bargain, refusal to meet as 
16
frequently as necessary, refusal to submit proposals 
17
or counterproposals, undue delays in bargaining, 
18
undue delays in submission of proposals or counter-
19
proposals, inadequate preparation for bargaining, 
20
and other conduct that constitutes bad-faith negoti-
21
ating; or 
22
(2) propose a new contract, memorandum, or 
23
other change in agency policy and implement that

proposal if the collective bargaining representative 
1
does not offer counterproposals in a timely manner. 
2
(d) NO DELAY FOR UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE COM-
3
PLAINT.—An agency’s filing of an unfair labor practice 
4
complaint under section 7118 of title 5, United States 
5
Code, against a collective bargaining representative shall 
6
not further delay negotiations. Agencies shall negotiate in 
7
good faith or request assistance from the Federal Medi-
8
ation and Conciliation Service and, as appropriate, the 
9
Panel, while such an unfair labor practice complaint is 
10
pending. 
11
(e) WRITTEN PROPOSAL EXCHANGE.—In developing 
12
proposed ground rules, and during any negotiations, agen-
13
cy negotiators shall request the exchange of written pro-
14
posals, so as to facilitate resolution of negotiability issues 
15
and assess the likely effects of specific proposals on agency 
16
operations and management rights. To the extent that an 
17
agency’s CBAs, ground rules, or other agreements contain 
18
requirements for a bargaining approach other than the ex-
19
change of written proposals addressing specific issues, the 
20
agency shall, at the soonest opportunity, take steps to 
21
eliminate them. If such requirements are based on now- 
22
revoked Executive orders, including Executive Order 
23
12871 (58 Fed. Reg. 52201; relating to Labor-Manage-
24
ment Partnerships) and Executive Order 13522 (74 Fed.

(f) AGREEMENT
REVIEW.—Pursuant to section 
4
7114(c)(2) of title 5, United States Code, the agency head 
5
shall review all binding agreements with collective bar-
6
gaining representatives to ensure that all their provisions 
7
are consistent with all applicable laws, rules, and regula-
8
tions. When conducting this review, the agency head shall 
9
ascertain whether the agreement contains any provisions 
10
concerning subjects that are non-negotiable, including pro-
11
visions that violate Government-wide requirements set 
12
forth in any applicable law, rule, or regulation. If an 
13
agreement contains any such provisions, the agency head 
14
shall disapprove such provisions. The agency head shall 
15
take all practicable steps to render the determinations re-
16
quired by this subsection within 30 days of the date the 
17
agreement is executed, in accordance with section 7114(c) 
18
of title 5, United States Code, so as not to permit any 
19
part of an agreement to become effective that is contrary 
20
to applicable law, rule, or regulation.

9
evaluate whether or not such matters are already covered

bargain. If such matters are already covered by a CBA,

the agency shall not bargain over such matters.

(b) PERMISSIBLE
BARGAINING.—Consistent with 
14
section 402 of this title, agencies that engage in bar-
15
gaining over procedures pursuant to section 7106(b)(2) of 
16
title 5, United States Code, shall, consistent with their ob-
17
ligation to negotiate in good faith, bargain over only those

cise of management rights, which do not include measures 
20
that excessively interfere with the exercise of such rights.

Likewise, consistent with section 402 of this title, agencies 
22
that engage in bargaining over appropriate arrangements 
23
pursuant to section 7106(b)(3) of title 5, United States

Code, shall, consistent with their obligation to negotiate

in good faith, bargain over only those items that constitute

appropriate arrangements for employees adversely af-

fected by the exercise of management rights. In such nego-
3
tiations, agencies shall ensure that a resulting appropriate 
4
arrangement does not excessively interfere with the exer-
5
cise of management rights.
