RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the benefits of vitamin D intake for preventing 
respiratory infection and COVID–19 complications, and 
to encourage the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention and the Food and Drug Administration to issue 
guidance 
on 
vitamin 
D 
intake 
for 
elderly 
and 
immunocompromised individuals during the coronavirus 
pandemic. 
Whereas, in December 2020, 120 health, science, and medical 
experts from the United Kingdom, the United States, 
and Europe sent an open letter to world governments as-
serting that there is clear scientific evidence that vitamin

Whereas, in July 2020, the American Society for Bone and 
Mineral Research (ASBMR), the American Association of 
Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE), the Endocrine Society, 
the European Calcified Tissue Society, the National 
Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF), and the International 
Osteoporosis Foundation (IOF) issued joint guidance on 
vitamin D intake during the COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas over 40 percent of American adults are vitamin D 
deficient and deficiency rates within African-American 
and Latino populations range from 70 to 80 percent; 
Whereas, in September 2020, United States infectious dis-
ease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci publicly commented on 
the importance of vitamin D for immune health and vita-
min D deficiencies resulting in increased susceptibility to 
infection; 
Whereas the United Kingdom National Health Service has a 
program to distribute vitamin D supplements to over 2.5 
million at-risk individuals, including seniors, individuals 
in long-term care facilities, and individuals with pre-
existing health conditions, during the COVID–19 pan-
demic; 
Whereas Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland’s public 
health agencies issued guidance encouraging vitamin D 
intake throughout the COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas several studies conducted by medical research teams 
and United States medical institutions have dem-
onstrated a correlation between vitamin D deficiencies 
and poor COVID–19 patient outcomes, including studies 
by Northwestern University and the University of Chi-
cago Medicine;

Whereas there are over 30 active clinical trials and 13 com-
pleted clinical trials worldwide examining the correlation 
between COVID–19 infection and vitamin D: Now, there-

fection;
