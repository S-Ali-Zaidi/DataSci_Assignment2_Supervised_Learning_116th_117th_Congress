(10) 12 percent of optometrists; 
Whereas the Association of American Medical Colleges at-
tested to the Supreme Court that the health care system 
of the United States relies on immigrant health care pro-
viders in their current roles; 
Whereas immigrants working in health care professions serve 
throughout the United States, and often in rural or un-
derserved communities; 
Whereas immigrants fill approximately one-third of physician 
roles in the United States; 
Whereas immigrants working in a health care occupation 
range from those granted temporary protected status 
under section 244 of the Immigration and Nationality 
Act (8 U.S.C. 1254a) or deferred action pursuant to the 
memorandum of the Department of Homeland Security 
entitled ‘‘Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with Re-
spect to Individuals Who Came to the United States as 
Children’’ issued on June 15, 2012 (referred to in this

preamble as ‘‘DACA’’), to naturalized United States citi-
zens; 
Whereas more than 12 percent of the immigrants working in 
health care occupations (310,000 individuals) are human-
itarian migrants, including refugees, asylees, special im-
migrant visa holders, and Cuban and Haitian entrants; 
Whereas 50,000 DACA recipients perform critical roles in the 
health care industry; 
Whereas the medical students, residents, and physicians who 
rely on DACA for their ability to practice medicine and 
provide medical care to approximately 4,600 patients per 
year; 
Whereas, in response to COVID–19, immigrants put their 
own lives on the line to save lives every day, working as 
diagnostic and treatment practitioners, physician assist-
ants, physicians, nurses, health aides, nursing assistants 
and orderlies, health care support workers, medical stu-
dents and residents, and health technologists and techni-
cians; 
Whereas more than 5,200,000 undocumented immigrants, in-
cluding more than one half of all DACA recipients 
(400,000 individuals) and the majority of Temporary 
Protected Status holders (more than 220,000 individuals) 
are considered essential critical infrastructure workers; 
Whereas immigrant essential workers, including first re-
sponders, health care workers, agricultural workers and 
meat packers, child care providers, and hospitality and 
transportation workers, have heroically helped provide 
medical care, food, shelter, and comfort to the individuals 
of the United States impacted by COVID–19;

•HRES 1181 IH 
Whereas undocumented immigrants alone contribute an esti-
mated $227,000,000,000 of spending power annually to 
the United States economy, after the payment of 
$49,000,000,000 of combined Federal, State, and local 
taxes each year; 
Whereas the majority of farm workers in the United States 
are immigrants, and regardless of politics, have been 
deemed ‘‘essential workers’’ to maintaining a safe food 
supply for the United States during the COVID–19 pan-
demic; 
Whereas immigrants have served in the Armed Forces since 
the founding of the United States, and have fought in 
every major conflict in United States history, including 
the Civil War, World Wars I and II, and conflicts in 
Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq; 
Whereas immigrants have put their lives on the line to pro-
tect the ideals of the United States and democracy, as 
well as lives of the people of the United States, by serv-
ing as translators and interpreters for the Armed Forces, 
including in Afghanistan and Iraq, and performing sen-
sitive and trusted activities for United States military 
personnel stationed with the International Security As-
sistance Force; 
Whereas immigrants who serve in emerging industries with 
pronounced labor shortages in the United States, such as 
artificial intelligence, that rely on science, technology, en-
gineering, and mathematics (referred to in this preamble 
as ‘‘STEM’’) skills, not only bolster the economy but also 
enhance national security and global leadership; 
Whereas when immigrants have a trusting relationship with 
local law enforcement agencies, immigrants have reported

•HRES 1181 IH 
crime and worked with law enforcement agencies on 
neighborhood crime reduction strategies; 
Whereas the United States has the largest number of immi-
grants in the world, and those immigrants represent al-
most every country in the world, contributing to the rich 
diversity of people, cultures, cuisine, literature, art, lan-
guage, academia, music, media, fashion, and customs; 
Whereas the United States is more diverse than ever before 
in its history, with greater shares than ever before of im-
migrants from India, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, the 
Philippines, El Salvador, Vietnam, Cuba, the Dominican 
Republic, the Republic of Korea, and Guatemala, and an 
increase of more than 90 percent since 2000 of Black im-
migrants from across the African Continent, the Carib-
bean, Jamaica, and Haiti; 
Whereas Black immigrants and their children make up 
roughly one-fifth of the overall Black population in the 
United States (21 percent); 
Whereas, in response to recent civil unrest in the United 
States, immigrants of all backgrounds have pledged their 
support to fight racial injustice, hand-in-hand with Black 
immigrants, to fight for accountability from law enforce-
ment and the criminal justice system, and to demand 
that law enforcement protect all individuals, regardless of 
their skin color; 
Whereas celebrating the racial, ethnic, linguistic, and reli-
gious differences of immigrants has resulted in a unified, 
patriotic, and prosperous United States; 
Whereas immigration has long been one of the greatest com-
petitive advantages of the United States;

•HRES 1181 IH 
Whereas immigrants of all skill levels have helped make the 
economy of the United States the strongest in the world, 
complementing existing businesses in the United States 
in times of need and founding successful businesses of 
their own; 
Whereas more than 40 percent of Fortune 500 companies 
were founded by immigrants or their children, which gen-
erate $4,200,000,000,000 in annual revenue and employ 
millions of individuals in the United States; 
Whereas, although approximately 14 percent of the popu-
lation of the United States are immigrants, a consider-
ably larger share of the labor force (18 percent) are im-
migrants; 
Whereas immigrants are entrepreneurial self-starters who 
create their own opportunity and employment opportuni-
ties for others, with 12 percent of employed immigrants 
being self-employed compared to 9 percent of employed, 
native-born individuals of the United States; 
Whereas immigrant-owned businesses provide jobs across the 
United States, supporting the creation of additional jobs 
through entrepreneurial activity in addition to the jobs 
they fill within their business; 
Whereas immigrants are more likely to have advanced de-
grees than native-born people of the United States; 
Whereas more than 1,000,000 international students are en-
rolled in colleges and universities across the United 
States, comprising about 5 percent of the total higher 
education population and helping make the United States 
the global leader in higher education;

•HRES 1181 IH 
Whereas approximately 100,000 international students each 
year would hope to stay and work in the United States, 
if an immigration option were available to them; 
Whereas the immigration system of the United States has 
not been meaningfully updated in nearly 30 years and is 
now outdated and overburdened, turning away highly 
skilled workers and international student graduates and 
putting the global leadership of the United States at risk; 
Whereas allowing international student graduates interested 
in remaining in the United States to secure a permanent 
immigration status would expand the economy by 
$233,000,000,000 during the next decade and would help 
reduce STEM-related talent shortages by 25 percent; 
Whereas national security experts agree that it is essential 
for 
the 
United 
States 
to 
maintain 
its 
military 
exceptionalism by being the leader in advanced tech-
nologies such as artificial intelligence, cyber, quantum, 
robotics, directed energy, and hypersonic weapons, which 
are all STEM fields where immigrants fill dangerous 
labor shortages in the United States; 
Whereas due to population aging and longer life expectancy 
of the population in the United States requiring an in-
crease in health care workers, immigrants are expected to 
fill a crucial need in the future health care system of the 
United States essential to keeping the people of the 
United States healthy; 
Whereas if undocumented individuals who came to the United 
States as children (commonly referred to as ‘‘Dreamers’’) 
alone were provided a pathway to citizenship, they would 
contribute approximately $799,000,000,000 to the econ-
omy of the United States during the next 10 years; 
00:17 Jun 16, 2022

•HRES 1181 IH 
Whereas future population growth in the United States will 
require increased immigration, and by increasing immi-
gration substantially, will keep the United States eco-
nomically competitive with China and other global econo-
mies, and reduce future fiscal imbalances for popular 
programs like programs under the Social Security Act 
(42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.); 
Whereas significantly increasing annual immigration levels 
would double the size of the United States economy by 
2050, dramatically lower the ratio of working-age individ-
uals to senior-age individuals, and increase the average 
income for workers in the United States; 
Whereas President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., most recently hon-
ored the accomplishments, contributions, and sacrifices of 
immigrants by proclaiming June 2022 to be ‘‘Immigrant 
Heritage Month’’ and by asking all people of the United 
States to observe June 2022 with appropriate program-
ming and activities to remind individuals of the values of 
diversity, equity, and inclusion; and 
Whereas continued integration of immigrants from around 
the world in a manner that encourages and facilitates a 
pathway to citizenship, economic and social mobility, and 
civic engagement will perpetuate the prosperity of the 
United States and reinforce the patriotism all people of 
the United States feel for the United States, no matter 
the color of skin, country of origin, or religious back-
ground of the individual: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—

(1) expresses support for the recognition of
