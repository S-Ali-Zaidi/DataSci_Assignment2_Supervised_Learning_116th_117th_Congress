(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:

•HR 7741 IH
(1) U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) 
1
is charged with securing the United States borders 
2
at and between ports of entry by stopping inadmis-
3
sible people and illicit goods. 
4
(2) In fiscal year 2020, the U.S. Border Patrol 
5
experienced 405,036 total encounters with illegal im-
6
migrants. Comparatively, the U.S. Border Patrol en-
7
countered 1,662,167 illegal immigrants in fiscal year 
8
2021—nearly 4 times the amount from the previous 
9
fiscal year. 
10
(3) Upon apprehending illegal immigrants at 
11
the southern border, which often occurs voluntarily, 
12
the individuals are then processed and detained by 
13
CBP agents in holding facilities for approximately 
14
52 hours, where they are provided 3 meals a day 
15
and a constant supply of water and snacks, and then 
16
subsequently placed into legal proceedings to deter-
17
mine the individual’s immigration eligibility. 
18
(4) If the undocumented individual requests 
19
asylum based on credible fear of persecution, the 
20
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services will make 
21
a determination if the individual does in fact have 
22
credible fear of persecution, and if so, the alien will 
23
then be placed in a standard removal process accord-
24
ing to section 240 of the Immigration and Nation-

ality Act (8 U.S.C. 1229a) and may then pursue a 
1
hearing before an immigration judge. 
2
(5) During these hearings, immigration judges 
3
within the Department of Justice’s Executive Office 
4
for Immigration Review determines whether an indi-
5
vidual is subject to removal or if the individual is eli-
6
gible for relief, although U.S. Immigration and Cus-
7
toms Enforcement (ICE) makes the initial decision 
8
immediately after the alien was processed at CBP 
9
detention facilities, to detain the individual or re-
10
lease them into the several communities of the 
11
United States pending their immigration hearing. 
12
(6) Aliens will then be considered for detention 
13
at ICE holding facilities or other detention plans co-
14
ordinated with nongovernmental organizations; how-
15
ever, due to limited space and other legal consider-
16
ations that relate to family units and immigration 
17
shelter licensing, many individuals that cross the 
18
southern border illegally are usually released into the 
19
several communities of the United States after leav-
20
ing CBP detention facilities. 
21
(7) All aliens released from ICE custody into 
22
the several communities of the United States are 
23
then assigned to a nondetained docket and must re-
24
port to ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations

(ERO) at least once a year while they await a deci-
1
sion on whether they should be removed from the 
2
United States—which, as of August 2020, consisted 
3
of over 3,300,000 outstanding cases waiting to be 
4
heard. 
5
(8) Some individuals in the nondetained docket 
6
are enrolled in Alternatives to Detention (ATD) pro-
7
grams, through which ERO ATD officers determine 
8
case management and supervision methods on a 
9
case-by-case basis, and if the alien complies with the 
10
terms of their plan within 30 days, the level of su-
11
pervision may be lowered. 
12
(9) One main method to ensure ATD compli-
13
ance is to provide the alien with technology services, 
14
which may include telephonic reporting, GPS moni-
15
toring via ankle bracelets, or a smartphone applica-
16
tion that allows for facial recognition scanning and 
17
GPS monitoring. 
18
(10) Before the individual’s immigration hear-
19
ing, many individuals simply dispose of their ATD 
20
compliance cell phone immediately upon release, or 
21
after their initial 30-day compliance meeting with 
22
EOR ATD, to abscond and avoid further detection 
23
from immigration enforcement agencies.

•HR 7741 IH
(11) Another prevalent reason for an alien’s 
1
falling out of contact with EOR ATD and thereby 
2
avoiding further detection includes instances where 
3
the alien moves within the United States and fails 
4
to provide updated contact information to EOR 
5
ATD. 
6
(12) Ninety-five to ninety-seven percent of 
7
aliens that are released into the several communities 
8
of the United States don’t show up for their removal 
9
hearings, resulting in many cases of undetected ille-
10
gal immigrants taking abode in the United States 
11
until they are subsequently, if ever, identified by im-
12
migration enforcement agencies.

(b) STATEMENT OF CONGRESS.—Congress— 
14
(1) recognizes the unprecedented immigration 
15
crisis currently occurring at the southern border; 
16
(2) condemns the Biden Administration’s 
17
prioritization of faster illegal immigrant processing 
18
time instead of implementing policies that actually 
19
deter illegal immigration from occurring in the first 
20
place; 
21
(3) deplores the use of any Federal funding 
22
under ATD plans to provide cell phones to illegal 
23
immigrants who are released into the several com-
24
munities of the United States;

(4) demands that President Joseph Biden re-
1
sume and finish construction of the southern border 
2
wall to diminish the opportunity for unlawful border 
3
crossings; 
4
(5) encourages the allocation of increased Fed-
5
eral funding towards additional CBP agents and 
6
monitoring technology at the southern border; 
7
(6) emphasizes and denounces the immense 
8
waste of United States taxpayer funding that is cur-
9
rently used to provide cell phones to immigrants who 
10
unlawfully enter the United States; and 
11
(7) stresses the national security concerns of re-
12
leasing illegal immigrants into the several commu-
13
nities of the United States based on the unlikely 
14
premise that such individuals will maintain the cell 
15
phone while awaiting their hearing date in United 
16
States immigration court.
