SEC. 101. FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
4
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) Taiwan is a free and prosperous democracy 
6
of nearly 24,000,000 people and an important con-
7
tributor to peace and stability around the world. 
8
(2) Section 2(b) of the Taiwan Relations Act 
9
(Public Law 96–8; 22 U.S.C. 3301(b)) states that it 
10
is the policy of the United States— 
11
(A) ‘‘to preserve and promote extensive, 
12
close, and friendly commercial, cultural, and 
13
other relations between the people of the United 
14
States and the people on Taiwan, as well as the 
15
people on the China mainland and all other peo-
16
ples of the Western Pacific area’’; 
17
(B) ‘‘to declare that peace and stability in 
18
the area are in the political, security, and eco-
19
nomic interests of the United States, and are 
20
matters of international concern’’; 
21
(C) ‘‘to make clear that the United States 
22
decision to establish diplomatic relations with 
23
the People’s Republic of China rests upon the

expectation that the future of Taiwan will be 
1
determined by peaceful means’’; 
2
(D) ‘‘to consider any effort to determine 
3
the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful 
4
means, including by boycotts or embargoes, a 
5
threat to the peace and security of the Western 
6
Pacific area and of grave concern to the United 
7
States’’; 
8
(E) ‘‘to provide Taiwan with arms of a de-
9
fensive character’’; and 
10
(F) ‘‘to maintain the capacity of the 
11
United States to resist any resort to force or 
12
other forms of coercion that would jeopardize 
13
the security, or the social or economic system, 
14
of the people on Taiwan’’. 
15
(3) Since the election of President Tsai Ing-wen 
16
as President of Taiwan in 2016, the Government of 
17
the People’s Republic of China has intensified its ef-
18
forts to pressure Taiwan through diplomatic isola-
19
tion and military provocations. 
20
(4) The rapid modernization of the People’s 
21
Liberation Army and recent military maneuvers in 
22
and around the Taiwan Strait illustrate a clear 
23
threat to Taiwan’s security.
