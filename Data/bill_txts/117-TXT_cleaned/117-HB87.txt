•HR 87 IH
(1) There is a correlation between possession of 
1
the obscene dolls, and robots, and possession of and 
2
participation in child pornography. 
3
(2) The physical features, and potentially the 
4
‘‘personalities’’ of the robots are customizable or 
5
morphable and can resemble actual children. 
6
(3) Some owners and makers of the robots have 
7
made their children interact with the robots as if the 
8
robots are members of the family. 
9
(4) The robots can have settings that simulate 
10
rape. 
11
(5) The dolls and robots not only lead to rape, 
12
but they make rape easier by teaching the rapist 
13
about how to overcome resistance and subdue the 
14
victim. 
15
(6) For users and children exposed to their use, 
16
the dolls and robots normalize submissiveness and 
17
normalize sex between adults and minors. 
18
(7) As the Supreme Court has recognized, ob-
19
scene material is often used as part of a method of 
20
seducing child victims. 
21
(8) The dolls and robots are intrinsically related 
22
to abuse of minors, and they cause the exploitation, 
23
objectification, abuse, and rape of minors.
