Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine examining the im-
pact of ocean acidification and other stressors in estua-
rine environments. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Ocean acidification impacts human health, 
3
natural resources, and the environmental, economic, 
4
and recreational uses of the coastline. 
5
(2) The current understanding of ocean acidifi-
6
cation impacts on estuarine ecosystems is inadequate 
7
to fully prepare and manage for changing environ-
8
mental conditions in nearshore locations. 
9
(3) While pH can be measured with high preci-
10
sion and accuracy in open ocean environments, more 
11
understanding of the carbonate system in estuarine 
12
ecosystems is needed for precise and accurate meas-
13
urements and observations. 
14
(4) The interaction of multiple stressors, includ-
15
ing salinity, pH, temperature, sea level rise, and nu-
16
trient input, within estuarine ecosystems is inad-
17
equately understood for managing the health, eco-
18
nomic, recreational, and environmental impacts driv-
19
en by these interactions. 
20
(5) A better understanding is needed of how 
21
anthropogenic influences in coastal environments af-
22
fect estuarine ecosystems. 
23
(6) More integration and coordination is needed 
24
among regional, national, and global environmental 
25
observations in estuarine environments, supporting

AND

ENVIRONMENTAL

STRESSORS ON ESTUARINE ENVIRONMENTS.

(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 60 days after the 
7
date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Commerce 
8
shall make appropriate arrangements with the National 
9
Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (re-
10
ferred to in this Act as the ‘‘National Academies’’) under 
11
which the National Academies shall conduct a study 
12
that— 
13
(1) examines the existing science of ocean acidi-
14
fication in estuarine environments; 
15
(2) examines the challenges to studying ocean 
16
acidification and ocean acidification’s interactions 
17
with other environment stressors in estuarine envi-
18
ronments; 
19
(3) provides recommendations for improving fu-
20
ture research with respect to ocean acidification in 
21
estuarine environments; and 
22
(4) identifies pathways for applying science in 
23
management and mitigation decisions relating to 
24
ocean acidification in estuarine environments.

(b) CONTENTS
OF STUDY.—The study described 
1
under subsection (a) shall include— 
2
(1) the behavior of the carbonate system within 
3
estuarine environments; 
4
(2) the interactions of the carbonate system 
5
with other biotic and abiotic characteristics of estua-
6
rine ecosystems; 
7
(3) how environmental and anthropogenic 
8
changes or disturbances could affect abiotic and bi-
9
otic processes within estuaries; 
10
(4) how estuarine biotic and abiotic processes 
11
will be affected under predicted environmental 
12
changes; 
13
(5) the current state of data collection, inter-
14
pretation, storage, and retrieval and observational 
15
infrastructure of abiotic and biotic parameters in es-
16
tuarine ecosystems; 
17
(6) the gaps that exist in understanding the 
18
socio-economic and health impacts of ocean acidifica-
19
tion in estuaries; 
20
(7) future directions for scientific research; and 
21
(8) pathways for applying science in manage-
22
ment and mitigation decisions. 
23
(c) REPORT.—In entering into an arrangement under 
24
subsection (a), the Secretary shall request that the Na-
