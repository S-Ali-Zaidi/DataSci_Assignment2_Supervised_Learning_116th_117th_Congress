SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
1
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Section 230 of the Communications Act of 
3
1934 (47 U.S.C. 230), as added by the Communica-
4
tions Decency Act of 1996 (Public Law 104–104; 
5
110 Stat. 133), was enacted to ensure that third 
6
parties would not be held liable as the publisher of 
7
another entity’s speech, not to allow online platforms 
8
to knowingly distribute unlawful materials. 
9
(2) Since enacted, section 230 has been mis-
10
interpreted to apply distributor immunity as well as 
11
publisher immunity to online platforms. As recently 
12
explained by Associate Justice Clarence Thomas in 
13
a statement respecting the denial of certiorari in 
14
Malwarebytes, Inc. v. Enigma Software Group USA, 
15
LLC, No. 19–1284 (October 13, 2020), ‘‘Although 
16
the text of §230(c)(1) grants immunity only from 
17
‘publisher’ or ‘speaker’ liability, the first appellate 
18
court to consider the statute held that it eliminates 
19
distributor liability too—that is, §230 confers immu-
20
nity even when a company distributes content that 
21
it knows is illegal.’’. 
22
(3) This assertion contradicts a plain reading of 
23
the Communications Decency Act of 1996, which in-
24
cludes distributor liability for exposing children to 
25
obscene material. This ill-conceived precedent, first

•HR 2000 IH
established in Zeran v. America Online, Inc., 129 
1
F.3d 327 (4th Cir. 1997), has resulted in online 
2
platforms having little to no responsibility to act as 
3
a ‘‘good Samaritan’’, even when moderating illicit 
4
material. 
5
(4) It has recently been reported by the New 
6
York Times that Pornhub executives believe that 
7
section 230 protects them from liability for their 
8
platform allegedly hosting videos of rape, child 
9
abuse, and other criminal activity. 
10
(5) As reported in the New York Post, a recent 
11
lawsuit has alleged that Twitter left up a child por-
12
nography video despite being notified by the victim, 
13
and only took it down after Federal officials inter-
14
vened. 
15
(6) Every American is entitled to equal justice 
16
under the law. 
17
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
18
gress that section 230 of the Communications Act of 1934 
19
(47 U.S.C. 230) does not provide distributor immunity 
20
and does not protect big tech companies when such compa-
21
nies knowingly peddle unlawful material.

be construed to prevent a provider or user of an
