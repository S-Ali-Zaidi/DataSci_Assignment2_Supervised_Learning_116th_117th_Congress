SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
5
Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) Physicians who are foreign-trained or inter-
7
national medical graduates, most of whom are not 
8
United States citizens, comprise almost one-quarter 
9
of active physicians. 
10
(2) Foreign-trained physicians who are not 
11
United States citizens and are not lawful permanent 
12
residents provide critical health care services and 
13
supply labor for the physician shortages, particularly 
14
in rural communities. 
15
(3) The COVID–19 pandemic has increased the 
16
demands on physicians and exacerbated the physi-
17
cian workforce shortage facing the United States, 
18
with projections estimating a shortage of over 
19
120,000 physicians by 2032. 
20
(4) The pandemic has contributed to delays in 
21
processing visa applicants, resulting in missed edu-
22
cational and economic opportunities. 
23
(5) Delays in visa processing can impact med-
24
ical training and impose hardships on both prospec-
