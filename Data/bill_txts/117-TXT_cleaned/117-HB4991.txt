ent or regulatory test data for a biomedical product or 
6
service, that the price of any biomedical product or service 
7
developed with the benefit of such research be reasonable 
8
(as determined by the Secretary) unless the Secretary 
9
waives such reasonable price obligation under subsection 
10
(d).
