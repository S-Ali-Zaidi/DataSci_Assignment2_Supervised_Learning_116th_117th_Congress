RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the Ukrainian famine of 1932–1933, known as the 
Holodomor, is recognized as a genocide and should serve 
as a reminder of repressive Soviet policies against the 
people of Ukraine. 
Whereas, in 1932 and 1933, millions of Ukrainians perished 
from a famine engineered by the former Soviet Union, 
designed to break the Ukrainian’s resistance to com-
munist occupation and to provide a cover for a campaign 
of repression and persecution carried out by the Soviet 
Union against the citizens and culture of Ukraine; 
Whereas the Soviet Union forced the people of Ukraine to re-
linquish their land, personal property, and housing to col-

lective farms and then confiscated grain harvests, starv-
ing the men, women, and children of Ukraine; 
Whereas the Soviet Union sealed the borders of Ukraine to 
prevent the delivery of humanitarian aid and to prevent 
Ukrainians from escaping; 
Whereas the entire nation of Ukraine suffered from the pro-
longed famine, resulting in the death of nearly a quarter 
of the rural population of Ukraine; 
Whereas title V of the Departments of Commerce, Justice, 
and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appro-
priations Act, 1986 (Public Law 99–180; 99 Stat. 1157), 
signed into law on December 13, 1985, established the 
Commission on the Ukraine Famine to ‘‘conduct a study 
of the Ukrainian Famine of 1932–1933 in order to ex-
pand the world’s knowledge of the famine and provide the 
American public with a better understanding of the So-
viet system by revealing the Soviet role’’ in it; 
Whereas the Commission on the Ukraine Famine, Investiga-
tion of the Ukrainian Famine 1932–1933: Report to 
Congress, adopted by the Commission, April 19, 1988, 
and submitted to Congress April 22, 1988, found that in 
1932 and 1933, the Government of the Soviet Union had 
committed genocide against the Ukrainian people; 
Whereas with the dissolution of the Soviet Union, archival 
documents confirmed the premeditated nature of the 
famine and exposed the atrocities suffered by the Ukrain-
ian people; 
Whereas Ukraine’s law N 376–V titled ‘‘About the 1932– 
1933 Holodomor in Ukraine’’ of November 28, 2006, 
gave official recognition to the Holodomor as an act of 
genocide against the Ukrainian people;

Whereas President George W. Bush signed into law Public 
Law 109–340 on October 13, 2006, authorizing the Gov-
ernment of Ukraine ‘‘to establish a memorial on Federal 
land in the District of Columbia to honor the victims of 
the Ukrainian famine-genocide of 1932–1933’’, which 
was officially dedicated in November 2015; 
Whereas the Government of Ukraine and the Ukrainian com-
munities in the United States and worldwide continue 
their efforts to secure awareness and understanding of 
the 1932–1933 tragedy; and 
Whereas victims of the Holodomor genocide of 1932–1933 
continue to be remembered: Now, therefore, be it
