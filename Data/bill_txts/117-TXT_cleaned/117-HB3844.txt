5
ing a highly interdisciplinary field with expertise re-
6
quired from a diverse range of scientific and other 
7
scholarly disciplines that traditionally work inde-
8
pendently and continue to face cultural and institu-
9
tional barriers to large scale collaboration. 
10
(5) The Federal Government should continue to 
11

12
opment, training, and education activities in artifi-
13
cial intelligence through coordination and collabora-
14
tion between government, academia, and the private 
15
