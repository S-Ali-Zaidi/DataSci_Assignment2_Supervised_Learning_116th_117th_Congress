1
ity to establish the terms and conditions States must fol-

ticle I, section 4 of the Constitution of the United

8
erning the time, place, and manner of elections for

Members of the House of Representatives; and 
10
(2) the authority granted to Congress under 
11
section 5 of the fourteenth amendment to the Con-
12
stitution gives Congress the power to enact laws to 
13
enforce section 2 of such amendment, which requires 
14
