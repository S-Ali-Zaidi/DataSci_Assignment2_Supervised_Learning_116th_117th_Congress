1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Violence in Mexico, Central America, and 
3
the Caribbean is exacerbated by firearms originating 
4
in the United States. 
5
(2) While firearms are trafficked to Mexico 
6
from a variety of countries, firearms originating in 
7
the United States account for 70 percent of the fire-
8
arms recovered and traced from crimes in Mexico, 
9
according to the 2021 GAO report ‘‘Firearms Traf-
10
ficking: U.S. Efforts to Disrupt Gun Smuggling into 
11
Mexico Would Benefit from Additional Data and 
12
Analysis’’. 
13
(3) United States-origin firearm flows con-
14
tribute to human rights violations, organized crime 
15
and gang violence, extrajudicial killings, high homi-
16
cide rates, domestic violence, and femicides in Mex-
17
ico, Central America, and the Caribbean. 
18
(4) According to the Executive Secretariat of 
19
National System for Public Security of Mexico, dur-
20
ing the period beginning in 2012 and ending in 
21
2021, Mexico experienced more than 168,000 fire-
22
arms homicides. 
23
(5) According to the United Nations Regional 
24
Centre for Peace, Disarmament and Development in 
25
Latin America and the Caribbean, firearms are used 
26
22:51 Dec 22, 2022

•HR 9539 IH
in 70 percent of homicides in the Caribbean com-
1
pared to 30 percent globally; the Caribbean has less 
2
than one percent of the world’s population, but 23 
3
percent of all recorded homicides. 
4
(6) In an August 2022 press conference, U.S. 
5
authorities from Homeland Security Investigations 
6
reported a ‘‘marked uptick in the number of weap-
7
ons’’, and an increase in the caliber and type of 
8
weapons, being illegally trafficked to Haiti and the 
9
rest of the Caribbean. 
10
(7) The Caribbean Basin Security Initiative of 
11
the Department of State that commenced in 2009 is 
12
the regional U.S. foreign assistance program that 
13
seeks to reduce illicit trafficking in the region and 
14
advance public safety and security. The program in-
15
cludes improving the capacity of Caribbean countries 
16
to intercept smuggled weapons at airports and sea-
17
ports, as well as support for forensic ballistics and 
18
firearms destruction and stockpile management. As-
19
sistance under the Caribbean Basin Security Initia-
20
tive has also included support for regional organiza-
21
tions, including— 
22
(A) the Caribbean Community Implemen-
23
tation 
Agency 
for 
Crime 
and 
Security 
24
(CARICOM IMPACS), based in Trinidad and

Tobago, the lead agency involved in the issue of 
1
illicit arms trafficking and increasing the capac-
2
ity of member states to detect and prevent fire-
3
arms trafficking; and 
4
(B) the Eastern Caribbean’s Regional Se-
5
curity System, based in Barbados. 
6
(8) Firearms trafficking from the United States 
7
and firearm violence are key drivers of immigration 
8
and asylum claims from Central America. 
9
(9) Two GAO reports (published in 2021 and 
10
2022, respectively) on firearms trafficking have af-
11
firmed that firearms trafficking to Mexico and Cen-
12
tral America continues to represent a security con-
13
cern to the United States, as United States-origin 
14
firearms are diverted from legitimate owners and 
15
end up in the hands of violent criminals, including 
16
drug traffickers and other transnational criminal or-
17
ganizations. A GAO report on the effect of firearms 
18
trafficking in the Caribbean has not yet been com-
19
piled. 
20
(10) In these reports, the Comptroller General 
21
found that Federal departments and agencies lacked 
22
information and analysis of the firearms trafficking 
23
networks in Mexico and Central America, that few 
24
efforts of the United States Government in the re-
25
22:51 Dec 22, 2022
H9539
5 
•HR 9539 IH
gion focused on firearms trafficking, and that, as a 
1
result, such agencies lack a detailed understanding 
2
of the firearms trafficking that fuels violence and 
3
enables criminals in Belize, El Salvador, Guatemala, 
4
Honduras, and Mexico. 
5
(11) In the 2022 GAO report ‘‘Firearms Traf-
6
ficking: More Information Needed to Inform U.S. 
7
Efforts in Central America’’, the Comptroller Gen-
8
eral found that efforts of the United States Govern-
9
ment focused on firearms trafficking in Belize, El 
10
Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras lacked informa-
11
tion about relevant country conditions and perform-
12
ance measures to ensure such efforts were designed 
13
and implemented to achieve the intended objectives 
14
and, as a result, the Comptroller General rec-
15
ommended that the Secretary of State obtain infor-
16
mation about the conditions in such countries, to 
17
support the development of effective programs to re-
18
duce the availability of illicit firearms. 
19
(12) Data on firearms trafficking is limited and 
20
to understand the problem, data compilation is cru-
21
cial. 
22
(13) In 2021 and 2022, the annual Country 
23
Reports on Human Rights Practices of the Depart-
24
ment of State included ‘‘unlawful and arbitrary 
25

killings’’ as a significant human rights issue in Gua-
1
temala, yet despite such inclusion, the Under Sec-
2
retary of Commerce for Industry and Security has 
3
authorized approximately 99,270 firearms exports to 
4
Guatemala since assuming responsibility for firearms 
5
licensing in 2020. 
6
(14) When firearms were controlled under the 
7
United States Munitions List and the licensing of 
8
firearms was the responsibility of the Secretary of 
9
State, the average number of firearms licensed for 
10
export to Guatemala was approximately 4,000 per 
11
year. 
12
(15) The current number of exports specified in 
13
paragraph (10) represents an extraordinary increase 
14
(as much as 25 times the average) from the number 
15
specified in paragraph (11), and the Under Sec-
16
retary of Commerce for Industry and Security has 
17
only been able to conduct a very limited number of 
18
end-use checks, according to the 2022 GAO report 
19
‘‘Firearms Trafficking: More Information Needed to
