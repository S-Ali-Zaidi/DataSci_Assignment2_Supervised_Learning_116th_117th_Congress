RESOLUTION 
Supporting the goals and ideals of National HIV/AIDS and 
Aging Awareness Day. 
Whereas National HIV/AIDS and Aging Awareness Day is a 
nationwide observance that brings attention to the grow-
ing number of people living long and full lives with HIV/ 
AIDS to their health, and to their social needs; 
Whereas more than 40 years into the epidemic, the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that in the 
United States there are more than 1,200,000 people liv-
ing with HIV/AIDS, and every year approximately 
40,000 people acquire HIV/AIDS;

Whereas over half of people living with HIV/AIDS in the 
United States and dependent areas are individuals who 
are aged 50 and over; 
Whereas globally, there are 5,700,000 people living with 
HIV/AIDS aged 50 and older; 
Whereas in the United States, one in six of every new HIV 
diagnosis is of an individual aged 50 and over; 
Whereas research indicates that older people in the United 
States are more likely than younger individuals in the 
United States to be diagnosed with HIV late in the 
course of their disease, meaning such older people are 
more likely to be dually diagnosed with HIV and AIDS; 
Whereas the Department of Health and Human Services re-
ports that people living with HIV for many years can ex-
hibit clinical characteristics observed in aging, including 
multiple chronic diseases or coexisting conditions, the use 
of multiple medications, changes in physical and cognitive 
abilities, and increased vulnerability to stressors; and 
Whereas September 18 of each year is recognized as National 
HIV/AIDS and Aging Awareness Day: Now, therefore, be 
it
