RESOLUTION 
Establishing a Women’s Bill of Rights to reaffirm legal 
protections afforded to women under Federal law. 
Whereas males and females possess unique and immutable bi-
ological differences that manifest prior to birth and in-
crease as they age and experience puberty; 
Whereas biological differences between the sexes mean that 
only females may get pregnant, give birth, and breastfeed 
children; 
Whereas biological differences between the sexes mean that 
males are, on average, larger in size and possess greater 
body strength than females;

Whereas biological differences between the sexes can expose 
females to more harm than males from specific forms of 
violence, including sexual violence; 
Whereas women have achieved inspirational and significant 
accomplishments in education, athletics, and employment; 
and 
Whereas recent misguided court rulings related to the defini-
tion of ‘‘sex’’ have led to endangerment of spaces and re-
sources dedicated to women, thereby necessitating clari-
fication of certain terms: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives reaf-
1
firms that— 
2
(1) for purposes of Federal law, a person’s 
3
‘‘sex’’ means his or her biological sex (either male or 
4
female) at birth; 
5
(2) for purposes of Federal law addressing sex, 
6
the terms ‘‘woman’’ and ‘‘girl’’ refer to human fe-
7
males, and the terms ‘‘man’’ and ‘‘boy’’ refer to 
8
human males; 
9
(3) for purposes of Federal law, the word 
10
‘‘mother’’ means a parent of the female sex and ‘‘fa-
11
ther’’ is defined as a parent of the male sex; 
12
(4) there are important reasons to distinguish 
13
between the sexes with respect to athletics, prisons, 
14
domestic violence shelters, restrooms, and other 
15
areas, particularly where biology, safety, and privacy 
16
are implicated;

(5) policies and laws that distinguish between 
1
the sexes are subject to intermediate constitutional 
2
scrutiny and permitted when they serve an impor-
3
tant governmental objective and are substantially re-
4
lated to achieving that objective; and 
5
(6) for purposes of complying with Federal laws 
6
that require State and local government agencies to 
7
collect or report data disaggregated by sex, such as 
8
Federal antidiscrimination laws, agencies are re-
9
quired to base such data on the biological sex of in-
10
dividuals at birth.
