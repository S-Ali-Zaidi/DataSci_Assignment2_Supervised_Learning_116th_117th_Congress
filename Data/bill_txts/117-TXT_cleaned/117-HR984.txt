Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
found in 2016 that more than one-third of all adults in 
the United States sleep less than 7 hours per night on 
a regular basis; 
Whereas the National Sleep Foundation’s 2020 Sleep in 
America Poll found that 44 percent of Americans say 
they feel sleepy between 2 and 4 days per week and 28 
percent reporting daytime fatigue 5 days per week; 
Whereas numerous studies have found that Black Americans 
are less likely than their White counterparts to get ade-
quate sleep, and that Black Americans may also be more 
likely to get lower quality sleep; 
Whereas Congress established the National Center on Sleep 
Disorders Research in 1993 to foster the coordination of 
sleep and circadian research within the National Insti-
tutes of Health and other Federal agencies; 
Whereas for over two decades, the National Sleep Foundation 
has organized Sleep Awareness Week to promote the ben-
efits of healthy sleep and its importance to overall health 
and well-being; and 
Whereas numerous States and organizations across the Na-
tion recognize and participate in Sleep Awareness Week: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) recognizes the importance of sleep health as 
2
a way to increase overall health and well-being; 
3
(2) supports the designation of a ‘‘Sleep Aware-
