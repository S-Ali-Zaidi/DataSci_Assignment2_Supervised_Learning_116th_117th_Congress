SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) According to the Office of the Taxpayer Ad-
3
vocate, the difference between tax liabilities owed to 
4
the Internal Revenue Service and those liabilities ac-
5
tually collected by the IRS, known as the ‘‘tax gap’’, 
6
averaged roughly $381,000,000,000 annually in un-
7
paid taxes from 2011 to 2013. 
8
(2) Recent studies project that the tax gap will 
9
be a cumulative $7,500,000,000,000 between 2020 
10
and 2029. 
11
(3) Between 2010 and 2018, the share of indi-
12
vidual income tax returns it examined fell by 46 per-
13
cent, and the share of corporate income tax returns 
14
it examined fell by 37 percent. 
15
(4) Individual income taxes are the largest 
16
group of uncollected taxes before audits, rep-
17
resenting about $314,000,000,000. 
18
(5) Estimates suggest that at least 70 percent 
19
of the tax gap comes from underpayment by the top 
20
1 percent. 
21
(6) In 2020, the Treasury’s Inspector General 
22
for Tax Administration announced that roughly 
23
880,000 high-income individuals who didn’t file tax 
24
returns between 2014–2016 failed to pay more than 
25
$45 billion in owed liabilities. Of those 880,000

cases, more than 325,000 were closed without ever 
1
being entered into the Internal Revenue Service’s 
2
(IRS) enforcement system, more than 40,000 cases 
3
were entered but were then subsequently closed 
4
without ever being worked on, and the remaining 
5
500,000 cases are ‘‘sitting in one of the collection 
6
function’s inventory streams and will likely not be 
7
pursued as resources decline’’. 
8
(7) In 2011, more than 12 percent of individ-
9
uals making $1,000,000 or more annually were au-
10
dited. In 2018, only 3.2 percent of such individuals 
11
were audited. 
12
(8) For 8 years in a row, IRS tax enforcement 
13
has declined. The IRS audited 0.45 percent of per-
14
sonal income-tax returns in fiscal year 2019, the 
15
lowest level in at least 4 decades. 
16
(9) Individuals are about half as likely to be au-
17
dited now compared to 2010. 
18
(10) Audit rates for those making $10,000,000 
19
or more fell from more than 14 percent in 2017 to 
20
roughly 6.5 percent in 2018. 
21
(11) Over the course of the past decade, the 
22
number of income tax returns has increased by 
23
roughly 9 percent.

(12) Audit rates for the largest corporations in 
1
2011 were more than 90 percent. Now, they are 
2
closer to 50 percent. 
3
(13) The corporate share of Federal tax rev-
4
enue has dropped by more than two-thirds in the 
5
past 65 years. 
6
(14) In 2010, corporate taxes accounted for 9 
7
percent of Federal revenue. 
8
(15) The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has pushed 
9
business taxes to record lows, and, according to the 
10
Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, 91 of 
11
the Fortune 500 companies paid $0 in income tax 
12
in 2018 despite turning a profit. 
13
(16) According to a report from the Office of 
14
the Taxpayer Advocate, the average United States 
15
household is paying an annual surtax of more than 
16
$3,000 to subsidize taxpayers who aren’t paying all 
17
that they owe. 
18
(17) According to the Congressional Budget Of-
19
fice, the IRS’s budget is roughly 20 percent below 
20
its peak 2010 inflation-adjusted budget. 
21
(18) According to the IRS, the agency has lost 
22
roughly 30,000 full-time positions since 2010, more 
23
than 20 percent of its staff.

(19) The amount of IRS funding and staff allo-
1
cated to enforcement activities has declined by about 
2
30 percent since 2010. 
3
(20) According to the IRS, roughly 30 percent 
4
of its workers will retire within the next 5 years. 
5
(21) Despite this, the agency has also seen in-
6
creased workload due to the implementation of the 
7
Affordable Care Act, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, 
8
and the COVID–19 pandemic. 
9
(22) Studies have shown that investing in en-
10
forcement and tightening rules could generate more 
11
than $1,000,000,000,000 over a decade. 
12
(23) The Federal Government estimates that 
13
each additional dollar spent on tax enforcement 
14
could yield more than $4 in revenue. 
15
(24) IRS data demonstrates that an extra audi-
16
tor-hour spent auditing returns for those earning 
17
$5,000,000 or more raises nearly $5,000. 
18
(25) In fiscal year 2018, the IRS collected 
19
nearly $3,500,000,000,000 on a budget of about 
20
$11,430,000,000. 
21
(26) The Congressional Budget Office estimates 
22
that increasing the IRS’s funding for examinations 
23
and collections by $20,000,000,000 over 10 years 
24
would increase revenues by $61,000,000,000, and

that increasing such funding by $40,000,000,000

over 
10 
years 
would 
increase 
revenues 
by 
2
$103,000,000,000.
