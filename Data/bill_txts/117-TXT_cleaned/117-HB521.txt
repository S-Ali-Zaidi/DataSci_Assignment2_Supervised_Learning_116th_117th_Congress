SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
8
It is the sense of Congress that— 
9
(1) it is in the best national and homeland se-
10
curity interests of the United States for Federal 
11
agencies to retain the specialized knowledge and ex-
12
perience of individuals who suffer an injury or illness 
13
while serving in a covered position (as defined under 
14
the amendments made by this Act); and 
15
(2) Federal agencies should ensure, to the 
16
greatest extent possible, that an individual who can 
17
no longer carry out the duties of a covered position, 
18
and is reappointed to a position in the civil service 
19
that is not a covered position, is reappointed within 
20
the same Federal agency, in the same geographic lo-
21
cation, and at a level of pay commensurate to the 
22
position which the individual held immediately prior 
23
to such injury or illness.
