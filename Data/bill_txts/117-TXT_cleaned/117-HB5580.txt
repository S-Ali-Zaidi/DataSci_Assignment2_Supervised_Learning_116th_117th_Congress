A BILL 
To establish an interagency task force to respond to People’s 
Republic of China coercive economic measures, and for 
other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Countering China Eco-
4
nomic Coercion Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) The Government of the People’s Republic of 
8
China (PRC) has used coercive economic measures 
9

•HR 5580 IH
against 
governments, 
businesses, 
organizations, 
1
other entities, and individuals to punish them for 
2
acting in ways the Government of the PRC sees as 
3
challenging PRC interests, and to pressure or other-
4
wise influence them to offer policy concessions to the 
5
PRC. 
6
(2) In an apparent effort to provide itself more 
7
plausible deniability and greater policy flexibility, the 
8
PRC often does not formally link a foreign policy 
9
dispute or grievance to the coercive measure it uses, 
10
opting for informal or extralegal measures rather 
11
than formal, published financial sanctions, trade 
12
controls, or investment restrictions. 
13
(3) The PRC has also increasingly sought to 
14
formalize some of its coercive economic measures 
15
through laws and measures that include strength-
16
ening its export control regime through the enact-
17
ment of a new Export Control Law and creation of 
18
an Unreliable Entities List. 
19
(4) In 2010, the PRC halted shipments of rare 
20
earth elements to Japan during a standoff over a 
21
clash between the Japan Coast Guard and a Chinese 
22
fishing vessel in disputed waters in the East China 
23
Sea.

(5) The PRC targeted Norway after an inde-
1
pendent group awarded the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize 
2
to imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo. In addi-
3
tion to freezing diplomatic relations and halting ne-
4
gotiations over a possible trade deal, the PRC im-
5
posed sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures to 
6
restrict Norwegian salmon exports to China. Salmon 
7
exports to China resumed in 2016 only after Norway 
8
pledged not to ‘‘support any actions that under-
9
mine’’ China’s core interests and stated that its own 
10
actions had harmed ‘‘mutual trust’’. 
11
(6) In 2012, the PRC blocked banana imports 
12
from the Philippines on the pretext of SPS issues 
13
and warned Chinese tourists against visiting the 
14
Philippines in response to a standoff over disputed 
15
Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea. 
16
(7) Following the election of Taiwan President 
17
Tsai Ing-wen in 2016, the PRC responded to Tsai’s 
18
unwillingness to explicitly endorse the terms of the 
19
1992 Consensus by curbing the number of mainland 
20
tourists and students allowed to travel to Taiwan. 
21
(8) In 2016, the PRC retaliated against Mon-
22
golia for hosting His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama 
23
by raising fees on commodity imports from Mon-
24
golia, creating delays at a major border crossing,

and canceling negotiations over a loan to the Mongo-
1
lian government. 
2
(9) Following South Korea’s 2016 decision to 
3
join the United States in deploying a United States 
4
missile defense system to defend against North Ko-
5
rea’s missile threat, the PRC took the following ac-
6
tions that is estimated to have cost South Korea 
7
$7.5 billion dollars in losses in 2017 alone: 
8
(A) Restricted South Korean entertain-
9
ment and other cultural exports from entering 
10
China. 
11
(B) Banned the sale of certain South 
12
Korea household products, including cosmetics, 
13
high-tech toilet seats, air purifiers, and food. 
14
(C) Restricted tourism between the two 
15
countries by ordering travel agencies not to pro-
16
vide South Korean tour packages and by reject-
17
ing Korean airlines’ applications to increase 
18
charter flights between the two countries. 
19
(D) Targeted the China business of Lotte, 
20
a South Korean conglomerate, by suspending 
21
new factories, launching cyberattacks against 
22
Lotte’s website, and closing significant numbers 
23
of Lotte Mart stores in China for alleged safety 
24
violations.

(10) After the Government of Australia called 
1
for an independent inquiry into the origins of the 
2
SARS–CoV–2 virus in 2020, the PRC retaliated by 
3
imposing tariffs on Australian wine and barley ex-
4
ports, placing restrictions on other commodities, and 
5
threatening to encourage Chinese students to boy-
6
cott Australian universities.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
8
It is the sense of Congress that— 
9
(1) the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) in-
10
creasing use of economic coercion against foreign 
11
governments, companies, organizations, other enti-
12
ties, and individuals requires that the United States 
13
better understand these measures in order to devise 
14
a comprehensive, effective, and multilateral response; 
15
(2) the private sector is a crucial partner in 
16
helping the United States Government understand 
17
the PRC’s coercive economic measures and hold the 
18
PRC accountable, and that additional business 
19
transparency would help the United States Govern-
20
ment and private sector stakeholders conduct early 
21
assessments of potential pressure points and 
22
vulnerabilities; and 
23
(3) PRC coercive economic measures creates 
24
pressures for the private sector to behave in ways
