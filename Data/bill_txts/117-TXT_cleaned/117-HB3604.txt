A BILL 
To amend the Employee Retirement Income Security Act 
of 1974 to enable consideration and disclosure by retire-
ment plans of Sustainable Investment Policies. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Retirees Sustainable 
4
Investment Opportunities Act of 2021’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
The Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) There is now incontrovertible evidence that 
8
environmental, social, and governance (hereinafter in 
9
00:30 Jul 20, 2021
H3604
2 
•HR 3604 IH
this Act referred to as ‘‘ESG’’) factors can have ma-
1
terial and substantial effects on investment perform-
2
ance. 
3
(2) The United States Department of Labor 
4
which is responsible for administering and enforcing 
5
the Employee Retirement Security Act of 1974 has 
6
historically recognized that retirement plans may 
7
make economically targeted investments (‘‘ETIs’’), 
8
that is, investments that offer the potential for eco-
9
nomic benefits, such as local job creation, commu-
10
nity economic development, and affordable and 
11
workforce housing construction, in addition to in-
12
vestment returns, provided such investments other-
13
wise comply with ERISA’s fiduciary requirements. 
14
(3) ESG and ETI-related factors are referred 
15
to in this Act as ‘‘sustainability considerations’’ and 
16
investments guided by sustainability considerations 
17
are referred to as ‘‘sustainable investments.’’ Sus-
18
tainable investments have the potential to contribute 
19
to the long-term well-being and resilience of individ-
20
uals and communities in this nation and around the 
21
world while earning investment returns comparable 
22
to or better than investments with similar risk that 
23
do not take these factors into account.

•HR 3604 IH
(4) Sustainable investing is now among the 
1
fastest growing segments of the investment industry 
2
with broad and growing interest from both indi-
3
vidual investors and institutional asset managers. 
4
Nevertheless, sustainable investments are virtually 
5
absent from ERISA-regulated retirement plans in 
6
the United States. 
7
(5) Retirement plans and participants in indi-
8
vidual account retirement plans should have the op-
9
portunity to make and hold sustainable investments, 
10
provided ERISA’s fiduciary requirements are other-
11
wise met. 
12
(6) Accordingly, fiduciaries for retirement plans 
13
should— 
14
(A) incorporate all relevant factors, includ-
15
ing sustainability-related factors, into invest-
16
ment analysis and decision-making processes, 
17
consistent with the investment time horizons of 
18
plan participants and beneficiaries; 
19
(B) be permitted to consider factors rel-
20
evant to sustainability, whether or not they can 
21
be demonstrated to be financially material, pro-
22
vided doing so does not diminish anticipated in-
23
vestment returns or increase investment risk

•HR 3604 IH
and is otherwise consistent with ERISA’s fidu-
1
ciary requirements; 
2
(C) encourage the adoption of best prac-
3
tices for sustainability performance and sustain-
4
ability impacts in the companies or other enti-
5
ties in which they invest; 
6
(D) consider plan participants’ and bene-
7
ficiaries’ sustainability-related interests and 
8
preferences when making investment decisions; 
9
(E) consider the impact of plan invest-
10
ments on the stability and resilience of the fi-
11
nancial system and on broad market returns as 
12
a result of the sustainability characteristics of 
13
those investments; 
14
(F) consider participation in shareholder 
15
engagement and proxy activities, policy advo-
16
cacy and similar actions based on sustainability 
17
considerations; and 
18
(G) disclose how they have implemented 
19
these commitments.
