RESOLUTION 
Supporting the members of the 87th Texas Legislature who 
embraced a noble stand against the State’s egregious 
assault on free and fair elections. 
Whereas more than 50 current State representatives of the 
special session of the 87th Texas Legislature left the 
State to deny the 150-member body the required two- 
thirds quorum, preventing a heinous voting suppression 
bill from passing; 
Whereas the State representatives and senators of the 87th 
Texas Legislature who have vowed not to participate in 
a quorum during this special legislative session, even 
under the looming threat of arrest, should be com-
mended;

•HRES 577 IH 
Whereas the State senators of the 87th Texas Legislature 
that left the State of Texas, as well as the members of 
the Texas senate that decided to stay and vote ‘‘no’’ on 
Texas Senate Bill 1, should be recognized; 
Whereas members of the Texas House Democratic Caucus 
and senators of the 87th Texas Legislature are recog-
nized as a coalition of the courageous for their valiant ef-
forts to uphold voting rights for all Texans; 
Whereas Texas House Bill 3 would adversely impact voting 
rights, especially for marginalized communities; 
Whereas Texas House Bill 3 would ban drive-through voting 
and 24-hour voting, limit the distribution of mail-in bal-
lot applications, and require new ID requirements for 
voting by mail; 
Whereas this coalition of the courageous joins the ranks of 
a group of Texas representatives and senators who em-
ployed the procedural walkout tactic in 2003 to delay 
votes on mid-Census redistricting; 
Whereas Texas House Bill 3 is one of many recent iterations 
of State-sanctioned voter suppression reported across the 
United States, with an overall total of 389 voter restric-
tion bills introduced in 48 States during 2021 legislative 
sessions according to the Brennan Center; 
Whereas, due to the increase in voter restriction and suppres-
sion legislation coupled with the upcoming 56th anniver-
sary of the enactment of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 
it is imperative that Congress pass H.R. 1, the For the 
People Act, and H.R. 4, the John Lewis Voting Rights 
Advancement Act, to preserve the right to free, fair, and 
safe elections for all Americans; and
