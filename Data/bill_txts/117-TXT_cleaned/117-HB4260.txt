A BILL 
To extend the life of the Minuteman III and pause the 
development of the new ground-based strategic deterrent 
program to reduce immediate and long-term costs. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Investing in Common-
4
sense Ballistic Missiles Act of 2021’’ or the ‘‘ICBM Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 4260 IH
(1) According to the Congressional Budget Of-
1
fice, the projected cost to sustain and modernize the 
2
United States nuclear arsenal, as of 2017, ‘‘is $1.2 
3
trillion in 2017 dollars over the 2017–2046 period: 
4
more than $800 billion to operate and sustain (that 
5
is, incrementally upgrade) nuclear forces and about 
6
$400 billion to modernize them’’. With inflation, the 
7
cost rises to $1,700,000,000,000 and does not in-
8
clude the cost of the additional nuclear capabilities 
9
proposed in the 2018 Nuclear Posture Review. 
10
(2) The Government Accountability Office 
11
found in July 2020 that the Department of Defense 
12
and the National Nuclear Security Administration 
13
have still not taken meaningful steps to address af-
14
fordability concerns or heeded the Government Ac-
15
countability Office’s recommendation to consider 
16
‘‘deferring the start of or cancelling specific mod-
17
ernization programs’’, including the W87–1 warhead 
18
modification program, to address increases in the 
19
weapons activities budget requests of the National 
20
Nuclear Security Administration. 
21
(3) The ground-based strategic deterrent pro-
22
gram is expected to cost between $93,100,000,000 
23
and $95,800,000,000 which does not include the 
24
cost of the W87–1 warhead modification program or 
25
17:35 Jul 26, 2021

•HR 4260 IH
the cost to produce new plutonium pits for the war-
1
head. The total estimated life cycle cost of the 
2
ground 
based 
strategic 
deterrent 
program 
is 
3
$264,000,000,000, and the program is intended to 
4
replace 400 deployed Minuteman III missiles with 
5
more than 600 new missiles, to allow for test flights 
6
and spares. 
7
(4) The Air Force awarded a sole-source con-
8
tract to Northrop Grumman for the engineering and 
9
manufacturing component of the ground-based stra-
10
tegic deterrent program in September 2020, raising 
11
concerns that the absence of competition for the 
12
award may result in higher than projected costs to 
13
United States taxpayers. 
14
(5) The National Nuclear Security Administra-
15
tion is also in the early stages of developing a re-
16
placement intercontinental ballistic missile warhead, 
17
the W87–1, and expanding plutonium pit production 
18
to build new warhead cores, costing at least 
19
$12,000,000,000 and $9,000,000,000, respectively, 
20
to meet the modernization needs of the ground-based 
21
strategic deterrent program. 
22
(6) Maintaining and updating the current Min-
23
uteman III missiles is possible for multiple decades 
24
and, according to the Congressional Budget Office, 
25
17:35 Jul 26, 2021
H4260

•HR 4260 IH
through 2036 this would cost $37,000,000,000 less 
1
in 2017 dollars than developing and deploying the 
2
ground-based strategic deterrent program. 
3
(7) On April 3, 2019, Lieutenant General Rich-
4
ard M. Clark, then-Air Force Deputy Chief of Staff 
5
for Strategic Deterrence and Nuclear Integration, 
6
noted in testimony before the Committee on Armed 
7
Services of the House of Representatives that we 
8
have ‘‘one more opportunity’’ to conduct life exten-
9
sion on the Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic 
10
missile, indicating the technical feasibility of extend-
11
ing the Minuteman III missile despite his stated 
12
preference for the ground-based strategic deterrent. 
13
(8) Even in the absence of an intercontinental 
14
ballistic missile leg of the triad, the 2018 Nuclear 
15
Posture Review signaled that the United States 
16
would have an assured retaliatory capability in the 
17
form of ballistic missile submarines, which are, ‘‘at 
18
present, virtually undetectable, and there are no 
19
known, near-term credible threats to the surviv-
20
ability of the [ballistic missile submarine] force’’, a 
21
benefit that will be enhanced as the Department of 
22
Defense moves to replace the Ohio class ballistic 
23
submarine fleet with the new Columbia class ballistic 
24
missile fleet.

(9) While intercontinental ballistic missiles had 
1
historically been the most responsive leg of the 
2
United States nuclear triad, advances in ballistic 
3
missile submarine communications now provide im-
4
mediate dissemination of information during war-
5
time. 
6
(10) Intercontinental ballistic missiles cannot be 
7
recalled, leaving decision-makers with mere minutes 
8
to decide whether to launch the missiles before they 
9
are destroyed, known as a posture of ‘‘launch on 
10
warning’’ or ‘‘launch under attack’’ in the face of a 
11
perceived nuclear attack, greatly increasing the risk 
12
of a national leader initiating a nuclear war by mis-
13
take. 
14
(11) In 1983, Stanislav Petrov, a former lieu-
15
tenant colonel of the Soviet Air Defense Forces cor-
16
rectly identified a false warning in an early warning 
17
system that showed several United States incoming 
18
nuclear missiles, preventing Soviet leaders from 
19
launching a retaliatory response, earning Colonel 
20
Petrov the nickname ‘‘the man who saved the 
21
world’’. 
22
(12) Former Secretary of Defense William 
23
Perry, who once briefed President Bill Clinton on a 
24
suspected Russian first nuclear strike, wrote that 
25
17:35 Jul 26, 2021
H4260
6 
•HR 4260 IH
the ground-based leg of the nuclear triad is ‘‘desta-
1
bilizing because it invites an attack’’ and interconti-
2
nental ballistic missiles are ‘‘some of the most dan-
3
gerous weapons in the world’’ and ‘‘could even trig-
4
ger an accidental nuclear war’’. 
5
(13) General James Cartwright, former vice 
6
chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and former Com-
7
mander of the United States Strategic Command, 
8
wrote, with Secretary Perry, ‘‘[T]he greatest danger 
9
is not a Russian bolt but a US blunder—that we 
10
might accidentally stumble into nuclear war. As we 
11
make decisions about which weapons to buy, we 
12
should use this simple rule: If a nuclear weapon in-
13
creases the risk of accidental war and is not needed 
14
to deter an intentional attack, we should not build 
15
it. . . . Certain nuclear weapons, such as . . . the 
16
[intercontinental ballistic missile], carry higher risks 
17
of accidental war that, fortunately, we no longer 
18
need to bear. We are safer without these expensive 
19
weapons, and it would be foolish to replace them.’’. 
20
(14) General George Lee Butler, the former 
21
Commander-in-Chief of the Strategic Air Command 
22
and subsequently Commander-in-Chief of the United 
23
States Strategic Command, said, ‘‘I would have re-
24
moved land-based missiles from our arsenal a long 
25

time ago. I’d be happy to put that mission on the 
1
submarines. So, with a significant fraction of bomb-
2
ers having a nuclear weapons capability that can be 
3
restored to alert very quickly, and with even a small 
4
component of Trident submarines—with all those 
5
missiles and all those warheads on patrol—it’s hard 
6
to imagine we couldn’t get by.’’. 
7
(15) While a sudden ‘‘bolt from the blue’’ first 
8
strike from a near-peer nuclear adversary is a highly 
9
unlikely scenario, extending the Minuteman III 
10
would maintain the purported role of the interconti-
11
nental ballistic missile leg of the triad to absorb such 
12
an attack.

SEC. 5. LIFE EXTENSION OF MINUTEMAN III INTERCONTI-
1
NENTAL BALLISTIC MISSILES. 
2
(a) LIFE EXTENSION PROGRAM.—Beginning not 
3
later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of 
4
this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall carry out a life 
5
extension program of Minuteman III intercontinental bal-

listic missiles to extend the life of such missiles to 2040. 
7
(b) ELEMENTS OF PROGRAM.—In carrying out the 
8
life extension program under subsection (a), the Secretary 
9
shall ensure the following: 
10
(1) The program will incorporate new and nec-
11
essary technologies that could also be incorporated 
12
in the future ground-based strategic deterrent pro-
13
gram, including with respect to technologies that— 
14
(A) increase the resilience against adver-
15
sary missile defenses; and 
16
(B) incorporate new nuclear command, 
17
control, and communications systems. 
18
(2) The program will use nondestructive testing 
19
methods and technologies similar to the testing 
20
methods used by the Navy for Trident II D5 sub-
21
marine launched ballistic missiles to reduce destruc-
22
tive testing.
