Whereas the attack occurred as members of the congregation 
prepared 
a 
free 
community 
meal 
served 
to 
all 
congregants arriving for Sunday services; 
Whereas several worshipers were injured including a respond-
ing officer, Lieutenant Brian Murphy, who was shot 15 
times at close range; 
Whereas Lieutenant Brian Murphy and all the first respond-
ers to the Oak Creek Gurdwara demonstrated great cour-
age in their quick response to the shooting, saving count-
less lives; 
Whereas the Oak Creek shooting was a senseless act of vio-
lence and tragedy that should never befall any house of 
worship; 
Whereas the Sikh community responded to the shooting in 
Oak Creek with compassion and stayed true to the Sikh 
principle of chardi kala, which roughly translates to ‘‘re-
lentless optimism’’; 
Whereas 10 years later, the effects of this shooting are still 
being felt and will be for years to come; and 
Whereas the Oak Creek community will continue to overcome 
the tragedy and become stronger than before: Now, 
therefore, be it
