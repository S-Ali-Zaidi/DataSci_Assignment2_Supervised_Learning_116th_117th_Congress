close family friends without their parents in the 
1
home, and the vast majority of such children are 
2
raised outside of the foster care system. 
3
(2) The majority of kinship caregivers are 
4
grandparents. 
5
(3) For every child in foster care living with rel-
6
atives, there are 19 being raised by relatives outside 
7
of the foster care system. 
8
(4) More than one-third of all children placed 
9
in foster care because of parental drug or alcohol 
10
use are placed with relatives. 
11
(5) Children who have been exposed to sub-
12
stance misuse in the home may also experience 
13
abuse and neglect, and research indicates that chil-
14
dren in family foster care because of substance use 
15
are more likely to be placed with relatives than with 
16
nonrelatives.
