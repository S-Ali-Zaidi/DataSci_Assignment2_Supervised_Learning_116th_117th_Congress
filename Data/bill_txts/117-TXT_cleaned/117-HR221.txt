RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for designation of March 14, 2021, as 
‘‘National Pi Day’’. 
Whereas the Greek letter (Pi) is the symbol for the ratio of 
the circumference of a circle to its diameter; 
Whereas the ratio Pi is an irrational number, which will con-
tinue infinitely without repeating, and has been cal-
culated to over 50 trillion digits; 
Whereas Pi is a fundamental mathematical constant that has 
been studied throughout history and is central in mathe-
matics as well as science and engineering; 
Whereas mathematics and science are a critical part of our 
children’s education;

Whereas aptitude in mathematics, science, and engineering is 
essential for a knowledge-based society; 
Whereas, according to the 2015 Trends in International 
Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) survey done by 
the National Center for Education Statistics, American 
children in the fourth and eighth grades were out-
performed by students in other countries including Singa-
pore, South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan; 
Whereas students from underrepresented minorities and from 
schools with high poverty rates have lower than average 
scores on the TIMSS survey; 
Whereas, while through eighth grade girls and boys have 
similar math and science scores on the TIMSS survey, 
there is a significant gender gap in math and physics 
scores at the end of high school; 
Whereas the United States needs to reinforce mathematics 
and science education for all students in order to better 
prepare children for the future and to succeed in a 21st- 
century economy; 
Whereas the National Science Foundation has been driving 
innovation in math and science education at all levels 
from elementary through graduate education since its 
creation 71 years ago; 
Whereas mathematics and science can be a fun and inter-
esting part of a child’s education, and learning about Pi 
can be an engaging way to teach children about geometry 
and attract them to study science and mathematics; and 
Whereas Pi can be approximated as 3.14, and thus March 
14, 2021, is an appropriate day for ‘‘National Pi Day’’: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
