A BILL 
To amend the Public Health Service Act to create a National 
Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder Consortium to 
provide grants, coordinate synergistic research, and tar-
geted therapy with respect to the causes of, and risk 
factors associated with, neuromyelitis optica spectrum 
disorder, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (in 
3
this section and section 3 referred to as ‘‘NMOSD’’) 
4
is a devastating neurologic disease leading to blind-
5
ness, paralysis, and premature death. 
6
(2) There are an estimated 16,000 to 17,000 
7
people with NMOSD in the United States and more 
8
than a quarter-million patients worldwide. 
9
(3) Women are affected up to 7 times more 
10
than men, and Afro-Caribbeans and Latino persons 
11
are about 2.5 times more predisposed to NMOSD 
12
than Caucasians. The reasons why Blacks and His-
13
panics are disproportionately affected cannot be fully 
14
understood without further studies. Furthermore, 
15
why NMOSD disproportionately occurs in females is 
16
unknown. 
17
(4) The average age at diagnosis is approxi-
18
mately 35 to 45 years, a peak window of time that 
19
further compounds the burden of NMOSD on par-
20
enthood and careers of women and men. The age 
21
range of NMOSD patients is broad and includes 
22
children as young as 3 years of age and adults as 
23
old as 90. 
24
(5) NMOSD imposes substantial costs for af-
25
fected patients and their families both in financial 
26
01:01 Feb 05, 2021
H254

•HR 254 IH
costs such those associated with medical care, pre-
1
scription medicines, and emergency room visits, as 
2
well as in opportunity costs such as its negative im-
3
pact on maintaining gainful employment or attend-
4
ing school or career development programs. 
5
(6) The origins of NMOSD are unknown, but 
6
it is hypothesized to be autoimmune in nature. Col-
7
lectively, autoimmune diseases currently affect ap-
8
proximately 1 in 10 Americans. Without a clear un-
9
derstanding of the causes of NMOSD, development 
10
of cures that save and improve lives and reduce the 
11
substantial associated health care costs will not be 
12
possible. 
13
(7) Despite the recent Food and Drug Adminis-
14
tration approval of three medications for NMOSD, 
15
there remains an unmet need for more effective and 
16
safe therapies to spare these patients from this re-
17
current disease with its accumulating neurologic dis-
18
ability. 
19
(8) Because of their relatively low overall inci-
20
dence, orphan diseases like NMOSD frequently do 
21
not receive sufficient attention and research funding. 
22
Of special importance is the opportunity for the re-
23
markable progress made recently regarding NMOSD 
24
to serve as— 
25

•HR 254 IH
(A) a model for solutions to rare and 
1
immunologic diseases; and 
2
(B) an exemplary therapeutic disease tar-
3
get for immunosuppressive therapies and for 
4
determining vaccination benefits and risks rel-
5
ative to COVID–19. 
6
(9) No single institution has a sufficient num-
7
ber of patients to independently conduct research 
8
that will adequately address the cause, prevention, 
9
treatment, and potential cure of NMOSD. Further-
10
more, there is a paucity of resources available for re-
11
generative medicine research in NMOSD that will be 
12
required to repair optic nerve and spinal cord dam-
13
age caused by NMOSD and thus to restore health. 
14
(10) There has been no comprehensive study 
15
analyzing all relevant clinical, biological, and epide-
16
miological aspects of NMOSD to identify potential 
17
risk factors and biomarkers for NMOSD. 
18
(11) We can apply our understanding of 
19
NMOSD to the study of other autoimmune diseases, 
20
including type 1 diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid ar-
21
thritis, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus 
22
erythematosus, and many others. 
23
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
24
It is the sense of Congress that— 
25
01:01 Feb 05, 2021
H254

•HR 254 IH
(1) there is a need to establish and coordinate 
1
a synergistic, multicenter research effort based on 
2
collaboration between regional consortia and govern-
3
mental and nongovernmental entities in order to— 
4
(A) comprehensively study the causes of 
5
NMOSD; 
6
(B) identify potential biomarkers of disease 
7
activity; 
8
(C) leverage recent efforts in developing 
9
approved therapies for NMOSD as a model for 
10
developing breakthrough therapies for other 
11
autoimmune diseases; and 
12
(D) highlight NMOSD as a model disease 
13
to better understand the potential benefits and 
14
risks of immunosuppressive therapy and innova-
15
tive vaccine strategies targeting COVID–19; 
16
(2) there is a need to encourage a collaborative 
17
effort among academic medical centers comprising 
18
epidemiological study groups capable of gathering 
19
comprehensive and detailed information for each pa-
20
tient enrolled in those groups; and 
21
(3) the effort referred to in paragraph (2) 
22
should facilitate investigation of environmental, nu-
23
tritional, genetic, and treatment factors with respect
