whelming, and cause strong emotions in both adults and 
children; 
Whereas, according to the National Institute of Mental 
Health, prior to the pandemic nearly 1 in 5 adults lived 
with a mental illness; 
Whereas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC), prior to the pandemic up to 1 in 5 
children ages 3 to 17 reported a mental, emotional, devel-
opmental, or behavioral disorder; 
Whereas the effects of COVID–19 have been well-docu-
mented, and the need for mental health and suicide pre-
vention services only continues to grow; 
Whereas the ‘‘Stress in America 2021: Stress and Decision- 
Making during the Pandemic’’ poll found that— 
(1) 1 in 3 adults (32 percent) are so stressed about 
the coronavirus pandemic that they struggle to make 
basic decisions, such as what to wear or what to eat; 
(2) millennials were (48 percent) more likely to 
struggle than individuals in Generation Z (37 percent), 
Generation X (32 percent), baby boomers (14 percent), 
and older adults (3 percent); 
(3) 59 percent of adults experienced behavior 
changes as a result of stress in the past month; and

that uncertainty about what the next few months will be 
like causes them stress;

27.8 percent reported an unmet need for counseling or 
therapy; 
Whereas negative mental health outcomes have also worsened 
for children; 
Whereas the impact of the pandemic on individuals, felt 
through the disruption of their lives, increased anxiety 
about the virus, and the death of loved ones, has had a 
traumatic effect; 
Whereas, according to the CDC, mental health disorders are 
chronic conditions, and without proper diagnosis and 
treatment children can face problems at home and in 
school, and mental health disorders can interfere with 
their future development; 
Whereas more mental health school staff and resources 
should be utilized to focus on prevention and early inter-
vention in the educational system, as that is where chil-
dren are most likely to receive mental health services; 
Whereas childhood depression is more likely to persist into 
adulthood if left untreated; 
Whereas disparities remain in access to mental health treat-
ment for youth of color, with Asian, Native American, 
and Black youth less likely to receive mental health care 
than their White counterparts;

sory to highlight the urgent need for families, educators 
and schools, community organizations, media and tech-
nology companies, and governments to address the Na-
tion’s worsening youth mental health crisis; 
Whereas the advisory further noted that youth mental health 
challenges have been on the rise even prior to COVID–

aged 10 to 24 increased by 57 percent;
