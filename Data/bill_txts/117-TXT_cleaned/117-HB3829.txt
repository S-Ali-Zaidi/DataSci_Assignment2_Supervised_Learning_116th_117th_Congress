SEC. 3. DEFINITION OF NATURAL CHEESE. 
6
(a) DEFINITION.—Section 201 of the Federal Food, 
7
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321) is amended by 
8
adding at the end the following: 
9
‘‘(ss)(1) The term ‘natural cheese’ means cheese that 
10
is a ripened or unripened soft, semi-soft, or hard product, 
11
which may be coated, that is produced— 
12
‘‘(A) by— 
13
‘‘(i) coagulating wholly or partly the pro-
14
tein of milk, skimmed milk, partly skimmed 
15
milk, cream, whey cream, or buttermilk, or any 
16
combination of such ingredients, through the 
17
action of rennet or other suitable coagulating 
18
agents, and by partially draining the whey re-
19
sulting from the coagulation, while respecting 
20
the principle that cheese-making results in a 
21
concentration of milk protein (in particular, the 
22
casein portion), and that consequently, the pro-
23
tein content of the cheese will be distinctly 
24
higher than the protein level of the blend of the
