1
person to sell a consumer fuel, at wholesale or retail, 
2
in an area and during a period of an energy emer-
3
gency covered by a proclamation issued under para-
4
graph (2) at a price that— 
5
(A) is unconscionably excessive; and 
6
(B) indicates the seller is exploiting the 
7
circumstances related to an energy emergency 
8
to increase prices unreasonably.

10
(A) IN
GENERAL.—The President may

(3) FACTORS CONSIDERED.— 
4
(A) IN GENERAL.—In determining whether

be taken into account, among other factors, the 
7
aggravating factors described in subparagraph 
8
(B) and the mitigating factor described in sub-

10
(B) AGGRAVATING FACTORS.—The aggra-
11
vating factors described in this subparagraph 
12
are the following: 
13
(i) Whether the amount charged by 
14
such person grossly exceeds the average 
15
price at which the consumer fuel was of-
16
fered for sale by such person during— 
17
(I) the 30-day period before the 
18
date on which the proclamation was 
19
issued; or 
20
(II) another appropriate bench-
21
mark period, as determined by the 
22
Commission.

•HR 7688 IH
which the same or a similar consumer fuel 
1
was readily obtainable in the same area 
2
from other sellers during the energy emer-
3
gency period. 
4
(C) MITIGATING FACTOR.—The mitigating 
5
factor described in this subparagraph is wheth-
6
er the quantity of any consumer fuel such per-
7
son produced, distributed, or sold in an area 
8
covered by the proclamation during the 30-day 
9
period following the date on which the procla-
10
mation was issued increased over the quantity 
11
such person produced, distributed, or sold dur-
12
ing the 30-day period before the date on which 
13
the proclamation was issued, taking into ac-
14
count any usual seasonal demand variation. 
15
(b) AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE.—It shall be an affirma-
16
tive defense in any civil action or administrative action to 
17
enforce subsection (a), with respect to the sale, at whole-
18
sale or retail, of a consumer fuel by a person, that the 
19
increase in the price of such consumer fuel reasonably re-
20
flects additional costs that were paid, incurred, or reason-
21
ably anticipated by such person, or reasonably reflects ad-
22
ditional risks taken by such person, to produce, distribute, 
23
obtain, or sell such consumer fuel under the cir-
24
cumstances.
