(a) UNITED STATES AGRICULTURE GOAL.—As part 
3
of a national greenhouse gas emission reduction effort to 
4
prevent climate change from exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius 
5
of warming above preindustrial levels, the goal for the ag-
6
ricultural sector in the United States shall be to achieve 
7
at least a 50 percent reduction in net greenhouse gases 
8
from 2010 levels by not later than 2030 and to achieve 
9
net zero emissions by not later than 2040. 
10
(b) SUBGOALS.— 
11
(1) RESEARCH.—To help achieve the goal speci-
12
fied in subsection (a), the total Federal investment 
13
