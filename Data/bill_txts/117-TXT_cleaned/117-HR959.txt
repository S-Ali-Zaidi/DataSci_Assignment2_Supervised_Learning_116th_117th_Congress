Whereas Chapter V, Article 23 of the Charter of the United 
Nations names ‘‘the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics’’ 
as a permanent member of the Security Council; 
Whereas the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics was dis-
solved on December 26, 1991; 
Whereas the Charter of the United Nations was not amended 
and still names the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics 
as a member of the United Nations and a Permanent 
Member of the United Nations Security Council; 
Whereas the United Nations General Assembly did not vote 
on a resolution to admit the Russian Federation; 
Whereas the United Nations General Assembly voted on reso-
lutions to admit other former Soviet Socialist Republics; 
Whereas there was not a United Nations General Assembly 
vote approving then Russian Federation President Boris 
Yeltsin’s letter transferring membership of the Union of 
Soviet Socialist Republics to the Russian Federation; and 
Whereas the Russian Federation under Vladimir Putin has 
repeatedly violated the United Nations Purposes and 
Principles, as established in the Charter of the United 
Nations, Article 2, paragraph 4 to ‘‘refrain in their inter-
national relations from the threat or use of force against 
the territorial integrity or political independence’’: Now,
