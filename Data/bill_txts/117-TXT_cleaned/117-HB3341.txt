SEC. 1207. PILOT PROGRAM ON USE OF INNOVATIVE PRAC-
5
TICES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS. 
6
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) The environmental review process for trans-
8
portation infrastructure projects is complex and inef-
9
ficient, resulting in delays and increased costs of de-
10
livery of needed improvements to our transportation 
11
system. 
12
(2) It is in the national interest to promote 
13
truly innovative approaches that have the potential 
14
to yield positive environmental and transportation 
15
outcomes more quickly and efficiently, with greater 
16
transparency and responsiveness to all stakeholders. 
17
(b) ESTABLISHMENT.—The Secretary of Transpor-
18
tation shall establish a pilot program to promote the use 
19
of innovative practices in carrying out environmental re-
20
views for transportation projects, including innovative 
21
practices that— 
22
(1) integrate environmental planning or other 
23
techniques involving consideration of multiple re-
24
sources on a watershed or ecosystem scale; 
25

•HR 3341 IH
(2) enhance environmental mitigation and en-
1
hancement measures that will result in a substantial 
2
improvement over existing conditions in an eco-
3
system or watershed; 
4
(3) use innovative technologies that enable more 
5
effective public participation in decision-making, in-
6
cluding use of visualization, animation, and other 
7
advanced methods for depicting alternatives; and 
8
(4) focus on environmental and transportation 
9
outcomes rather than processes. 
10
(c) FLEXIBILITIES.—In carrying out the pilot pro-
11
gram established under subsection (b), the Secretary, in 
12
concurrence with the affected agency may waive, with re-
13
spect to an eligible project, any requirement under Federal 
14
law, regulation, or order, if the Secretary and such agen-
15
cies find that waiving the requirement is reasonably ex-
16
pected to— 
17
(1) promote the development of innovative prac-
18
tices for the environmental review process, as de-
19
scribed in paragraphs (1) through (4) of subsection 
20
(b); 
21
(2) enable the more efficient delivery of needed 
22
improvements to the transportation system; and 
23
(3) result in achieving the conservation goals of 
24
relevant statutes.
