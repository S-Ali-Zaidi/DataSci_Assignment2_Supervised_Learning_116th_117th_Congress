RESOLUTION 
Condemning antisemitism by public figures. 
Whereas there is currently a crisis of rising antisemitism, 
both at home and around the world; 
Whereas with increasing frequency, influential public figures, 
celebrities, and foreign government officials use social 
media platforms to spread their antisemitic, hateful 
views, including Holocaust denial and praise for Adolf 
Hitler; 
Whereas the Anti-Defamation League’s (ADL) most recent 
‘‘Audit of Antisemitic Incidents’’ in the United States re-
corded 2,717 acts of assault, vandalism, and harassment 
in the year 2021 alone, an average of more than 7 inci-
dents per day, which represents a 34-percent increase 
from 2020 and the highest year on record since ADL 
began tracking antisemitic incidents in 1979; 
Whereas there have been a growing number of deadly attacks 
on the Jewish community in our country, and just since 
2018, high-profile attacks on Jews have occurred in Jer-
sey City, New Jersey, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Poway, 
California, Colleyville, Texas, and others; 
Whereas, in May 2022, the House of Representatives passed 
H. Res. 1125, Condemning Rising Antisemitism, which 
calls on elected officials, faith leaders, and civil society 
leaders to use their platforms to condemn and combat 
any and all manifestations of antisemitism; 
Whereas there has been a marked increase in prominent pub-
lic figures using hate speech online; and 
Whereas it is the responsibility of elected officials to speak 
up against antisemitism: Now, therefore, be it
