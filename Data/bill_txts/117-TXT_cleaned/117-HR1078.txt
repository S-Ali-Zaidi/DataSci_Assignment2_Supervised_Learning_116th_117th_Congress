Whereas April 11, 2022, marks the 54th anniversary of the 
enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, title VIII of 
which (42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq.) is commonly known as 
the Fair Housing Act; 
Whereas the Chicago Freedom Movement, led by the Rev-
erend Doctor Martin Luther King, Jr., expanded the 
fight for civil rights from the South to the North, raised 
the national consciousness about housing discrimination, 
and shaped the debate that led to the landmark Fair 
Housing Act; 
Whereas the National Advisory Commission on Civil Dis-
orders, appointed by President Lyndon B. Johnson and 
commonly known as the Kerner Commission, found on 
February 29, 1968, that ‘‘our nation is moving toward 
two societies, one black and one white—separate and un-
equal’’; 
Whereas Congress passed the Fair Housing Act as part of 
the Civil Rights Act of 1968, and President Lyndon B. 
Johnson signed the Act into law on April 11, 1968, one 
week after the assassination of the Reverend Doctor Mar-
tin Luther King, Jr.; 
Whereas the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cul-
tural Rights recognize adequate housing as a human 
right; 
Whereas the original Fair Housing Act prohibited discrimina-
tion in housing and housing-related transactions on the 
basis of race, color, national origin, and religion; 
Whereas the mission statement of the Department of Hous-
ing and Urban Development (HUD) reflects a commit-

ment to ‘‘build inclusive and sustainable communities free 
from discrimination’’; 
Whereas in section 808 of the Housing and Community De-
velopment Act of 1974 (Public Law 93–383), Congress 
amended the Fair Housing Act to include protection on 
the basis of sex, including gender identity and sexual ori-
entation; 
Whereas September 13, 2022, will mark the 34th anniversary 
of the congressional passage of the Fair Housing Amend-
ments Act of 1988; 
Whereas the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, passed 
by overwhelming margins in Congress, included protec-
tion on the basis of familial status and disability, created 
an important enforcement mechanism, and expanded the 
definition of ‘‘discriminatory housing practices’’ to in-
clude interference and intimidation, requiring HUD to 
issue regulations to implement and interpret the Fair 
Housing Act and report annually to Congress on the na-
ture and extent of housing discrimination; 
Whereas the intent of Congress in passing the Fair Housing 
Act was broad and inclusive, to advance equal oppor-
tunity in housing and achieve racial integration for the 
benefit of all people in the United States; 
Whereas the intent of Congress in passing the Fair Housing 
Act was to prohibit discrimination in all housing and 
housing-related transactions, including policies or prac-
tices that appear superficially neutral, but have a dis-
criminatory effect on protected classes; 
Whereas the Supreme Court of the United States of America 
has reaffirmed the use of the disparate impact doctrine 
21:05 Apr 29, 2022

•HRES 1078 IH 
to challenge policies or practices that have a discrimina-
tory effect on protected classes; 
Whereas the majority of large metropolitan areas in the 
United States are more racially segregated today than in 
1990; 
Whereas research shows that, in some cases, the placement 
of housing funded through the Low Income Housing Tax 
Credit program, which is the single largest source of Fed-
eral funding for the creation of affordable housing in the 
United States, further entrenches racial residential seg-
regation, despite the Fair Housing Act requiring that 
Federal housing funds be used to affirmatively undo pat-
terns of residential segregation; 
Whereas fair housing testing has revealed that discrimination 
on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity ex-
ists and that fair housing protections must be extended 
to the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer 
(LGBTQ+) community; 
Whereas same-sex couples are 73 percent more likely to be 
denied a home mortgage compared to heterosexual cou-
ples, and when same-sex couples are approved, they pay 
an average of $86,000,000 more in combined annual in-
terest and fees; 
Whereas fair housing testing has revealed that discrimination 
exists against people who use public housing assistance, 
including support from the Housing Choice Voucher and 
Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing programs and other 
sources of income, and that fair housing protections 
against source-of-income discrimination must be provided 
to all people;

•HRES 1078 IH 
Whereas there continues to be widespread discrimination in 
the housing industry against Black, Latinx, and Asian- 
American home buyers by real estate agents; 
Whereas owner-occupied homes located in majority-Black 
communities 
are 
undervalued 
by 
a 
cumulative 
$156,000,000,000 when compared to owner-occupied 
homes in similarly situated communities that have very 
few or no Black residents; 
Whereas the average home in a White neighborhood is valued 
two times higher than comparable homes in Black and 
Latinx neighborhoods, even after controlling for neigh-
borhood characteristics; 
Whereas 97.7 percent of appraisers identify as White and 
69.6 percent identify as male, compared to the total 
United States population that identifies as 60.1 percent 
White and 49.2 percent male; 
Whereas 67 percent of people experiencing homelessness in 
America are Black, Latinx, and Indigenous; 
Whereas an individual’s housing conditions impact their 
health, educational attainment level, employment oppor-
tunities, and personal wealth; 
Whereas borrowers of color lack equal access to quality and 
affordable credit compared to similarly situated White 
borrowers; 
Whereas research shows that Black and Latinx borrowers 
pay $765,000,000 more in combined mortgage interest 
each year compared to similarly situated White borrowers 
due to discriminatory factors in mortgage lending by the 
government-sponsored housing finance enterprises; 
Whereas 2020 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data show 
that the majority of loans purchased by the government-

•HRES 1078 IH 
sponsored housing finance enterprises primarily served 
higher-income, White borrowers in wealthier, majority- 
White neighborhoods; 
Whereas Black and Latinx borrowers are more likely to re-
ceive mortgage loans through the Federal Housing Ad-
ministration, even when they qualify for conventional 
lending options that may be offer more affordable terms; 
Whereas research shows that algorithmic bias and discrimina-
tion exist in online housing platforms, automated valu-
ation models, and lending that use artificial intelligence 
for advertising and decision-making purposes, and there 
is an urgent need to eliminate individual bias that enters 
into the development of artificial intelligence systems and 
systemic bias through the use of inappropriate or histori-
cally biased data; 
Whereas the majority of Americans support neighborhood in-
tegration and numerous studies have shown the universal 
benefits of residential integration; 
Whereas reports indicate there are more than 4,000,000 vio-
lations of fair housing laws each year against people of 
all protected classes, and fair housing testing continues 
to uncover a high rate of discrimination in the rental, 
sales, mortgage lending, and insurance markets; 
Whereas 68,000,000 adults in the United States believe they 
have experienced unequal treatment in their housing 
search due to their status as a member of a protected 
class under the Fair Housing Act; 
Whereas less than one percent of fair housing violations are 
reported each year; 
Whereas private nonprofit fair housing organizations funded 
by Fair Housing Initiatives Program serve as the front

line in the effort to resolve housing discrimination and 
train local housing providers on how to comply with the 
Fair Housing Act; 
Whereas, in 2020, there were a total of 28,712 housing dis-
crimination complaints reported nationwide, of which 
over 73 percent, or 21,089 complaints, were filed with 
local, private, nonprofit fair housing organizations; 
Whereas the Fair Housing Assistance Program funds State 
as well as local civil and human rights enforcement agen-
cies to investigate and process housing discrimination 
complaints, conduct special enforcement projects, and 
take part in training and other projects designed to en-
hance the agency’s administration and enforcement of its 
fair housing law; 
Whereas while our Nation has made great strides in elimi-
nating housing discrimination, families with children, 
women, people with disabilities, people of color, religious 
minorities, immigrants, LGBTQ+ individuals, and low- 
income people receiving public assistance, among others, 
still face discriminatory barriers to housing; 
Whereas fair housing education and enforcement play a piv-
otal role in increasing housing choice and homeownership 
opportunities for members of protected classes and com-
bating predatory lending; 
Whereas amid a global health and economic crisis, housing 
discrimination against health care workers and people 
who have been infected by coronavirus, or are perceived 
as having been infected, is contributing to increased evic-
tions and hate crimes; 
Whereas systemic health and economic disparities are exacer-
bated by the coronavirus pandemic, disproportionately in-

fecting communities of color, destabilizing their employ-
ment opportunities, and resulting in higher levels of evic-
tions and foreclosures; 
Whereas amidst the coronavirus pandemic, as mortgage inter-
est rates reached historic lows, Black borrowers were dis-
proportionately denied mortgage loans to purchase and 
refinance homes due to biased and potentially discrimina-
tory appraisal and lending policies and practices, exclud-
ing them from wealth-building opportunities and lower 
housing costs; 
Whereas amidst the coronavirus pandemic, harmful senti-
ments toward Asian-American and Pacific Islander com-
munities have incited increases in racialized and gendered 
violence across the Nation;

percent during the coronavirus pandemic, with incidents 
disproportionately being reported by women of color and 
transgender women; 
Whereas immigrant and limited-English proficient commu-

tices, and resources during the coronavirus pandemic to 
prevent predatory and discriminatory housing and lend-
ing practices; 
Whereas persons with disabilities must have equal access to
