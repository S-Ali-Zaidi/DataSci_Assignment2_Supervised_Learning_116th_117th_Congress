RESOLUTION 
Supporting the designation of the third week of November, 
November 14 to November 20, 2021, as ‘‘TED Aware-
ness Week’’. 
Whereas the National Institutes of Health defines a rare dis-
ease as a condition that affects fewer than 200,000 peo-
ple in the United States; 
Whereas currently there are approximately 7,000 rare dis-
eases impacting almost 30,000,000 Americans; 
Whereas thyroid eye disease (TED) is a serious, progressive, 
and rare autoimmune condition in which the body’s im-
mune system mistakenly attacks healthy muscle and fat 
tissue behind the eye, causing inflammation and scar tis-
sue to form;

Whereas people living with TED often have debilitating 
symptoms of eye bulging, double vision, blurred vision, 
pain, and facial disfigurement, and in severe cases, TED 
can lead to blindness; 
Whereas people living with TED are often impacted by long- 
term functional, psychosocial, and economic burdens, in-
cluding the inability to work or perform activities of daily 
living; 
Whereas the exact underlying process by which TED occurs 
is not fully understood, and TED is a serious, vision- 
threatening condition that can get worse over time; 
Whereas TED is a rare disease and is estimated to have a 
prevalence of 16 per 100,000 women in the United 
States, and 2.9 per 100,000 men in the United States; 
Whereas a diagnosis of TED is based upon identification of 
characteristic symptoms, a detailed patient history, a 
thorough clinical evaluation, and a variety of specialized 
tests; and 
Whereas there is a genetic component to the condition, and 
people who have a family member with the disease or a 
family member with an autoimmune disease are at a 
greater risk of developing the condition: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives recog-
1
nizes those leading advocacy organizations, including the 
2
Autoimmune Association and Prevent Blindness, that are

engaged in disease awareness and patient support about
