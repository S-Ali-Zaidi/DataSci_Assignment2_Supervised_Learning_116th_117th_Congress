SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The dearth of civics lessons available to stu-
3
dents across the United States has helped to foster 
4
a political climate that is deeply partisan and di-
5
vided. 
6
(2) Polarized party politics in the United States 
7
has fractured public morale in our institutions and 
8
has created an environment in which people are less 
9
likely to be well-informed on the current state of af-
10
fairs and to participate in the political process. 
11
(3) According to the Annenberg Constitution 
12
Day Civics Survey conducted by the Annenberg Pub-
13
lic Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania— 
14
(A) in 2018, only 32 percent of people in 
15
the United States surveyed were capable of 
16
naming all 3 branches of Government, while 33 
17
percent of Americans were not able to name 
18
any of the branches of government; 
19
(B) in 2018, 30 percent of people in the 
20
United States surveyed knew that the Senate is 
21
in charge of Supreme Court nominee confirma-
22
tions; and 
23
(C) in 2017, 37 percent could not name 
24
any of the rights guaranteed under the First 
25
Amendment.

(4) In 2014, only 23 percent of eighth graders 
1
were found to have performed at or above the pro-
2
ficient level on the National Assessment of Edu-
3
cational Progress civics exam conducted by the Na-
4
tional Center of Education Studies. 
5
(5) A lack of knowledge on the basics of the 
6
structure of our democratic republic creates an in-
7
creasingly ill-prepared electorate which overtime has, 
8
and will continue to, contribute to a weakened de-
9
mocracy.
