ical in order to advance United States interests in 
1
the Indo-Pacific region; and 
2
(2) this partnership between the world’s oldest 
3
and largest democracies is critical and must con-
4
tinue to be strengthened in response to increasing 
5
threats in the Indo-Pacific regions, sending an un-
6
equivocal signal that sovereignty and international 
7
law must be respected.

(b) UNITED STATES-INDIA INITIATIVE ON CRITICAL 
9
AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES (ICET).—The Congress 
10
finds that the United States-India Initiative on Critical 
11
and Emerging Technologies (iCET) is a welcome and es-
12
sential step to developing closer partnerships between gov-
13
ernments, academia, and industry in the United States 
14
and India to address the latest advances in artificial intel-
15
ligence, quantum computing, biotechnology, aerospace, 
16
and semiconductor manufacturing. Such collaborations be-
17
tween engineers and computer scientists are vital to help 
18
ensure that the United States and India, as well as other 
19
democracies around the world, foster innovation and facili-
20
tate technological advances which continue to far outpace 
21
Russian and Chinese technology.

(1) India faces immediate and serious regional 
1
border threats from China, with continued military 
2
aggression by the Government of China along the 
3
India-China border, 
4
(2) India relies on Russian-built weapons for its 
5
national defense, and 
6
(3) the United States should take additional 
7
steps to encourage India to accelerate India’s transi-
8
tion off Russian-built weapons and defense systems 
9
while strongly supporting India’s immediate defense 
10
needs.

(d) WAIVER OF CAATSA SANCTIONS IN BEST IN-
12
TERESTS OF UNITED STATES AND THE UNITED STATES- 
13
INDIA DEFENSE PARTNERSHIP.—While India faces im-
14
mediate needs to maintain its heavily Russian-built weap-
15
ons systems, a waiver to sanctions under the Countering 
16
America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act during this 
17
transition period is in the best interests of the United 
18
States and the United States-India defense partnership to 
19
deter aggressors in light of Russia and China’s close part-
20
nership.
