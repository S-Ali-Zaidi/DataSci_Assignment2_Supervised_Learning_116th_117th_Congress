SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds that— 
2
(1) approximately 28,000,000 individuals in the 
3
United States are afflicted with some hearing im-
4
pairment, and it has been estimated that 10,000,000 
5
of those impairments are at least partially attrib-
6
utable to damage from exposure to noise; 
7
(2) for millions of individuals in the United 
8
States, noise from aircraft, vehicular traffic, and a 
9
variety of other sources is a constant source of tor-
10
ment; 
11
(3) millions of individuals in the United States 
12
are exposed to noise levels that can lead to sleep 
13
loss, psychological and physiological damage, and 
14
work disruption; 
15
(4) chronic exposure to noise has been linked to 
16
increased risk of cardiovascular disorders, learning 
17
deficits in children, stress, and diminished quality of 
18
life; 
19
(5) excessive noise leading to sleep deprivation 
20
and task interruptions can result in untold costs to 
21
society as a result of diminished worker productivity; 
22
(6) pursuant to the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 
23
7401 et seq.), the Noise Control Act of 1972 (42 
24
U.S.C. 4901 et seq.), and the Quiet Communities

1
Agency established and maintained an Office of 
2
Noise Abatement and Control, which has not re-
3
ceived funding since 1982; 
4
(7) responsibilities of the Office of Noise Abate-
5
ment and Control included promulgating noise emis-
6
sion standards, requiring product labeling, facili-
7
tating the development of low-noise-emission prod-
8
ucts, coordinating Federal noise reduction programs, 
9
assisting State and local noise abatement efforts, 
10
and promoting noise education and research; 
11
(8) because the Environmental Protection 
12
Agency remains legally responsible for enforcing reg-
13
ulations issued under the Noise Control Act of 1972 
14
(42 U.S.C. 4901 et seq.), even though funding for 
15
the activities of the Office of Noise Abatement and 
16
Control described in paragraph (7) was terminated, 
17
and because that Act prohibits State and local gov-
18
ernments from regulating noise sources in many sit-
19
uations, noise abatement programs across the 
20
United States lie dormant; and 
21
(9) as population growth and air and vehicular 
22
traffic continue to increase, noise pollution is likely 
23
to become an even greater problem in the future, 
24
and the health and welfare of individuals in the
