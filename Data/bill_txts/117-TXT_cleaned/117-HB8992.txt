To require a Federal methane super-emitter detection 
strategy, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

(a) STRATEGY.—

(1) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 90 days after 
9
the date of the enactment of this Act, the Adminis-

trator, in consultation with the National Oceanic 
1
and Atmospheric Administration, the National Insti-
2
tute of Standards and Technology, and other rel-
3
evant agencies, shall enter into an agreement with 
4
the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, 
5
and Medicine to develop a science-based strategy to 
6
assess, evaluate, and make recommendations regard-
7
ing the use of present and future greenhouse gas 
8
monitoring and detection capabilities, including 
9
ground-based, airborne, and space-based sensors and 
10
integration of data relating to such monitoring and 
11
detection from other indicators, with a focus on the 
12
ability to detect large methane emission events (com-
13
monly referred to as ‘‘methane super-emitters’’). 
14
(2) REQUIREMENTS.—The strategy described in 
15
subsection (a) shall include the following elements: 
16
(A) Development of a consensus definition 
17
for the term ‘‘methane super-emitter’’. 
18
(B) Examination of whether and how cur-
19
rent and planned Federal greenhouse gas moni-
20
toring and detection capabilities may be lever-
21
aged to monitor and detect methane super- 
22
emitters, and identify key gaps in such capabili-
23
ties.

(C) Consideration of a means to facilitate 
1
effective interagency collaboration for green-
2
house gas monitoring and detection, data stand-
3
ards, stewardship, and data integration, to 
4
monitor and detect methane super-emitters. 
5
(D) Consideration regarding how agencies 
6
that conduct greenhouse gas monitoring and de-
7
tection can enhance the scientific and oper-
8
ational value and enable the broader application 
9
of 
information 
regarding 
methane 
super- 
10
emitters, including by operationalizing methane 
11
super-emitter data to support the rapid mitiga-
12
tion of methane sources and integrating such 
13
data from multiple sources. 
14
(E) Consideration of options for the Fed-
15
eral Government to partner with non-govern-
16
mental entities, including State and local gov-
17
ernments, academia, non-profit organizations, 
18
commercial industry, and international organi-
19
zations, to effectively leverage present and fu-
20
ture greenhouse gas monitoring and detection 
21
capabilities to monitor and detect methane 
22
super-emitters.

(b) USE OF STRATEGY.—The Administrator may use 
4
the strategy described in subsection (a) to inform the plan-
5
ning of research and development activities regarding 
6
greenhouse gas monitoring and detection and the moni-
7
toring and detection of methane super-emitters.

(c) REPORT.—Not later than 18 months after the 
9
date of the execution of the agreement between the Admin-
10
istrator and the National Academies of Sciences, Engi-
11
neering, and Medicine under subsection (a), the National 
12
Academies shall submit to the Administrator, the Com-
13
mittee on Science, Space, and Technology of the House 
14
of Representatives, and the Committee on Commerce, 
15
Science, and Transportation of the Senate a report on the 
16
strategy described in subsection (a). 
17
(d) DEFINITIONS.—In this section: 
18
(1) ADMINISTRATOR.—The term ‘‘Adminis-
19
trator’’ means the Administrator of the National 
20
Aeronautics and Space Administration. 
21
(2) GREENHOUSE GAS MONITORING AND DE-
22
TECTION.—The term ‘‘greenhouse gas monitoring 
23
and detection’’ means the direct observation, from
