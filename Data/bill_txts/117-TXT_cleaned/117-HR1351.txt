RESOLUTION 
Condemning Azerbaijan’s unprovoked military attack on 
Armenia. 
Whereas, on September 13, 2022, Azerbaijan launched an 
unprovoked assault on sovereign Armenian territory, with 
intensive shelling and UAV attacks on the villages of 
Karmir Shuka and Taghavard in Nagorno Karabakh 
(Artsakh), and the Armenian border cities of Vardenis, 
Jermuk, Goris, and Tatev reportedly resulting in the 
deaths of at least 49 soldiers; 
Whereas this is only the most recent escalation by Azer-
baijan, as in September 2020, Azerbaijan launched a 
massive and unprovoked military assault on Nagorno- 
Karabakh, resulting in the deaths of thousands of civil-
ians and soldiers, the displacement of tens of thousands

more civilians, and the ongoing detention of over 100 
prisoners of war; 
Whereas Azerbaijan’s actions are in flagrant violation of Ar-
menia’s sovereignty, territorial integrity, and inter-
national law and represent a further escalation of Azer-
baijani aggression, which has continued unabated since 
the November 2020 tripartite statement signed by Arme-
nia, Azerbaijan, and Russia to end the Nagorno- 
Karabakh war; 
Whereas, in June 2022, the Department of State again 
waived section 907 of the Freedom Support Act to pro-
vide assistance to Azerbaijan, despite the recent publica-
tion of a Government Accountability Office report (22– 
104619), which confirmed the Department of State and 
Department of Defense have failed to meet statutory re-
porting requirements to Congress on the impact of 
United States assistance on the peace process and the 
military balance between Armenia and Azerbaijan; 
Whereas section 907 of the Freedom Support Act is intended 
to prevent United States military assistance to Azer-
baijan unless the President certifies Azerbaijan ‘‘is taking 
demonstrable steps to cease all blockades and other offen-
sive uses of force against Armenia and Nagorno- 
Karabakh’’; and 
Whereas peace, stability, and democracy in the Caucasus re-
gion are in the political, security, and economic interests 
of the United States and are matters of international 
concern: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
