dish in the United States, as evidenced by an increase in 
available kimchi-related food products, restaurant menu 
items, and interest from non-Korean consumers, rep-
resents a positive example of multicultural exchange; and 
Whereas kimchi is celebrated in Korea, the land of its origin, 
each year through the designation of November 22 as 
‘‘Kimchi Day’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives supports

the designation of ‘‘Kimchi Day’’.
