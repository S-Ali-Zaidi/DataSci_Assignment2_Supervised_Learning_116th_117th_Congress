(1) The Internal Revenue Service is facing un-
1
precedented challenges following the outbreak of the 
2
COVID–19 and the Federal response which included 
3
significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code.

9
the Internal Revenue Service still had approximately 
10
11.7 million backlogged returns from tax year 2020,

and it took the IRS until June of 2021 to get 
12
through its 2019 backlog.

14
Service still had a backlog of approximately 6 million 
15
unprocessed individual tax returns.

17
Service have a disproportionately negative impact on 
18
low-income Americans.

Service received approximately 282 million phone 
21

were actually answered by customer service rep-
23
