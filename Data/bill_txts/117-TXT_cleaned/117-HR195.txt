Budget, Members of Congress can better debate our Na-
tion’s fiscal situation; 
Whereas the national debt is the greatest threat to the na-
tional security of the United States; 
Whereas the national debt has climbed past $28 trillion; 
Whereas we continue to accrue at least $100 million in debt 
every hour; 
Whereas Members of Congress refuse to balance the budget 
and reduce spending; 
Whereas spending increases year after year with no end in 
sight; 
Whereas the most recent spending bill has suspended the 
debt limit; 
Whereas a real-time display of the gross national debt will in-
form each Member of the Committees of the need to take 
action to reduce the debt; 
Whereas the exact amount of the gross national debt will be 
known and updated with every action affecting the 
amount of debt; and 
Whereas display of the national debt in the main hearing 
room of the Committee on Appropriations and in the 
main hearing room of the Committee on the Budget of 
the House of Representatives will be a sign that rep-
resentatives are committed to reducing the national debt: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved,
