9
iture of any funds appropriated pursuant to this Act or 
10
any other provision of law for environmental research and 
11
development related to regulatory program activities shall 
12
be coordinated with and reflect the research needs and pri-

of the Improving Science in Chemical Assessments Act, 
19
any covered assessments carried out with respect to a 
20
chemical substance through the Integrated Risk Informa-
21
tion System program of the Environmental Protection 
22
Agency as of the day before such date of enactment shall, 
23
in lieu of being carried out through such program, be car-
24
ried out by the relevant program office of the Environ-
25
mental Protection Agency, so long as the relevant program

office determines there is a need for such an assessment. 
1
Such an assessment shall be carried out using the sci-
2
entific standards specified in section 7B and be based on 
3
the weight of the scientific evidence. 
4
‘‘(c) TOXICITY VALUES.—In carrying out a covered 
5
assessment with respect to a chemical substance under 
6
subsection (a), the relevant program office shall assign a 
7
toxicity value or values, when scientifically supported by 
8
the available data, for such chemical substance. With re-
9
spect to that assignment, the following shall apply: 
10
‘‘(1) When supported by the available data, the 
11
toxicity value or values shall include a range of point 
12
estimates of risk as well as sources and magnitudes 
13
of uncertainty associated with the estimates. 
14
‘‘(2) When multiple point estimates can be de-
15
veloped, the relevant program office shall— 
16
‘‘(A) consider all datasets; and 
17
‘‘(B) make a determination about how best 
18
to represent the human health risk posed by the 
19
chemical substance involved.

assigned to a chemical substance under subsection

chemical substance included in such database.

date of the enactment of the Improving Science in Chem-
