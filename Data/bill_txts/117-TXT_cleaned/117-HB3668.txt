SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
The Congress finds that— 
2
(1) Federal water infrastructure investments 
3
provide State and local governments and other re-
4
cipients of Federal financial assistance with substan-
5
tial support for activities that produce significant 
6
employment and other economic opportunities; 
7
(2) low-income persons and very low-income 
8
persons, who live in the areas in most need of such 
9
investments, often have restricted access to employ-
10
ment and other economic opportunities; 
11
(3) the employment and other economic oppor-
12
tunities generated by projects and activities that re-
13
ceive Federal water infrastructure investments offer 
14
an effective means of empowering low-income per-
15
sons and very low-income persons, particularly those 
16
who live in the areas where these funds are being 
17
used to improve water infrastructure; and 
18
(4) Federal efforts to invest in water infrastruc-
19
ture should also help create employment and other 
20
economic opportunities for low-income persons and 
21
very low-income persons in areas where these 
22
projects are taking place.
