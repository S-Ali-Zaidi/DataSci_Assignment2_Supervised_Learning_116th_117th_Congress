RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the work and contributions of doulas towards 
improving pregnancy, birth, and postpartum outcomes. 
Whereas doulas can play an important role in— 
(1) maternal care; and 
(2) addressing maternal mortality and morbidity in 
the United States; 
Whereas doula support includes continuous non-clinical 1-on- 
1 emotional, physical, and informational support around 
the time of birth, including during pregnancy and 
postpartum; 
Whereas doulas empower mothers with information about 
pregnancy and childbirth; 
Whereas studies have shown that doula-assisted mothers are 
4 times less likely to have a low-birth weight baby, and

2 times less likely to experience complications during 
pregnancy; 
Whereas research indicates that, with the support of doulas, 
women are— 
(1) more likely to have vaginal births; and 
(2) less likely to require epidural anesthesia; 
Whereas, in 2013, the Expert Panel on Improving Maternal 
and Infant Health Outcomes in Medicaid and the Chil-
dren’s Health Insurance Program of the Centers for 
Medicare and Medicaid Services identified providing cov-
erage for continuous doula support during labor as a po-
tential strategy to enhance maternal and infant care 
management; 
Whereas the presence of a doula during pregnancy, child-
birth, and postpartum helps foster shared decision mak-
ing for birthing women by facilitating communication be-
tween women and their providers; 
Whereas a doula provides continuous support during labor 
and delivery and can alert hospital staff to signs and 
symptoms of complications that require immediate med-
ical attention, thus lowering the risk of escalating com-
plications for the mother and baby; 
Whereas access to doula support services, especially in under-
served communities, may contribute to— 
(1) improved birth outcomes, both physically and 
emotionally; and 
(2) lower health care costs by reducing the risk of— 
(A) low-birth weight babies; 
(B) complications that might otherwise go un-
noticed; 
(C) low-risk cesarean deliveries; and

(D) epidural anesthesia; 
Whereas training members of underserved communities to be-
come doulas and support mothers in their own commu-
nities can— 
(1) help provide employment opportunities for im-
proving maternal health; and 
(2) build trust and reduce adverse consequences of 
racial bias for pregnant and postpartum women of color; 
and 
Whereas community-based maternal health care models, in-
cluding doula support services, in collaboration with ob-
stetrical care, show great promise in improving, and re-
ducing disparities in, maternal health outcomes: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) recognizes the important role of doulas in 
2
providing respectful, responsive care to all women, 
3
including women in underserved communities who

5
(2) acknowledges that doula support services 
6

7
to help mothers achieve healthy pregnancies and safe 
8
deliveries and recoveries; 
9
(3) urges greater recognition for the important 
10
role that doulas play in— 
11
(A) supporting improved pregnancy, birth, 
12
and postpartum outcomes, including maternal 
13
mental health;

5

ness for, and advocate for the benefits of, doulas and 
8
the support services doulas provide; and
