SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
1
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that— 
2
(1) Congress agreed with recommendations of a 
3
Federal commission that, if Federal land is to be re-
4
tained by the Federal Government and not con-
5
tribute to the tax bases of the units of general local 
6
government within the jurisdictions of which the 
7
land is located, compensation should be offered to 
8
those units of general local government to make up 
9
for the presence of nontaxable land within the juris-
10
dictions of those units of general local government; 
11
(2)(A) units of general local government rely on 
12
the stability of property tax revenues; and 
13
(B) Federal programs that are subject to the 
14
annual appropriations process, such as the Pay-
15
ments in Lieu of Taxes program, offer far less cer-
16
tainty than property taxes as a form of revenue for 
17
units of general local government; 
18
(3) Federal agencies have determined that pay-
19
ments to units of general local government under the 
20
Payments in Lieu of Taxes program are far lower 
21
than what would be due to units of general local 
22
government under tax equivalency; 
23
(4) payments under the Payments in Lieu of 
24
Taxes program help units of general local govern-
25
ment carry out vital services, such as firefighting,

•HR 2755 IH
police protection, public education, construction of 
1
public schools, construction of roads, and search- 
2
and-rescue operations; and 
3
(5) the technology exists to more accurately ap-
4
proximate what the taxable value of land held by the 
5
Federal Government would be if that land were tax-
6
able by units of general local government. 
7
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
8
gress that the Federal Government should— 
9
(1) determine the amount that payments under 
10
the Payments in Lieu of Taxes program would be if 
11
those payments were equivalent to the tax revenues 
12
that units of general local government would other-
13
wise receive for the same land; and 
14
(2) compensate those units of general local gov-
15
ernment accordingly.
