Congress finds the following:

•HR 8001 IH
(1) The United States dollar composes nearly 
1
two-thirds of the world’s currency reserves, with 
2
more than one trillion dollars being owned by the 
3
Government of China as of October 2020. 
4
(2) It is the policy of the United States to ad-
5
vance freedom and human rights globally, a policy 
6
that is incompatible with egregious human rights 
7
violations, and as such has a responsibility to ensure 
8
that the United States currency market does not 
9
complicitly support perpetrators of these abuses. 
10
(3) In regions of the world where political, gov-
11
ernmental, or other realities preclude humanitarian 
12
due diligence practices from ensuring the currency 
13
market of the United States is not interwoven with 
14
entities’ egregious human rights violations, addi-
15
tional measures must be taken to separate the econ-
16
omy of the United States from these violations, as 
17
well as to apply pressure on relevant actors to up-
18
hold their humanitarian responsibilities.
