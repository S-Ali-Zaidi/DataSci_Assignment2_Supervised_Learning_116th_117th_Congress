(2) From 2002 through 2006, Jennifer Madai 
1
Moreno was an active member of the San Diego 
2
High School Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps 
3
(JROTC), which is a Department of the Army 
4
Honor Unit with Distinction, the highest rating by 
5
the Army. She was also chosen to be a member of 
6
the San Diego Unified School District Brigade Staff. 
7
As a high school senior, she rose quickly to become 
8
the top junior marksman in California through the 
9
Civilian Marksmanship Program. 
10
(3) Moreno accepted a JROTC scholarship to 
11
the University of San Francisco (USF) for Nursing, 
12
becoming the first person in her family to go to col-
13
lege. While at USF, she was chosen for Leadership 
14
Development Training. She ultimately achieved the 
15
highest level of physical fitness in her ROTC unit. 
16
(4) Following her graduation from USF with a 
17
Bachelor of Science degree in Nursing in 2010, 
18
Moreno received her commission in the United 
19
States Army as a Second Lieutenant Nurse Corps 
20
Officer. 
21
(5) Upon commissioning, Moreno served as a

(6) Moreno was chosen to attend and completed 
1
the Basic Airborne Course in Fort Benning, Georgia 
2
and Army Medical Department Officer Basic Course 
3
at Ft. Sam Houston, Texas. 
4
(7) Moreno was then assigned to Madigan 
5
Army Medical Center, Joint Base Lewis McCord, 
6
Washington in January 2011, where she served as 
7
a Clinical Staff Nurse on medical-surgical unit. 
8
Moreno earned her certification as a Medical Sur-
9
gical Registered Nurse in February 2011. 
10
(8) Moreno volunteered for a position with U.S. 
11
Army Special Operations Command in 2011. She 
12
was selected into the SOC Cultural Support Team 
13
program. She was deployed to Afghanistan in June 
14
2013 with the Army’s 75th Ranger Regiment. 
15
(9) On October 6, 2013, Moreno was attached 
16
to a U.S. Army Ranger unit on a night mission in 
17
the Zhari district in Kandahar province to capture 
18
a high-value target when four explosive devices were 
19
triggered. 
20
(10) During the last moments of Moreno’s life, 
21
she reportedly heard a call to help a wounded soldier 
22
struck by a blast. Moreno did not hesitate to re-
23
spond to the call for help. As she made her way to

help a fallen soldier, she triggered the fifth explo-
1
sion, which ended her life. 
2
(11) Moreno was the first Nurse CST member 
3
to die in action. Part of her legacy is the number of 
4
young women coming from medical fields seeking 
5
out voluntary assignments to join the CST program. 
6
(12) Moreno was the first combat casualty to be 
7
buried at Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery in San 
8
Diego since the post-9/11 conflicts began. She re-
9
ceived full military honors. 
10
(13) After graduating from college in 1966, 
11
Kathleen Mae Bruyere was accepted into U.S. Navy 
12
Officer Candidate School, after which she was as-
13
signed as an on-campus Navy recruiting officer in 
14
California. 
15
(14) Bruyere was named to the staff of Rear 
16
Admiral Allen Hill in 1975, becoming the first 
17
woman to serve as flag secretary to an admiral. 
18
(15) In January 1976, Bruyere was chosen as 
19
one of 12 Women of the Year on the cover of Time 
20
Magazine. 
21
(16) In 1977, Bruyere joined five other women 
22
officers who sued the United States Secretary of the 
23
Navy and the United States Secretary of Defense 
24
over restrictions that prevented women from serving

on combat aircraft and ships. This led to the 1948 
1
Women’s Armed Services Integration Act being 
2
struck down as unconstitutional, overturning a ban 
3
on women serving at sea. 
4
(17) In 1987, as Special Assistant to the Chief 
5
of Naval Operations for women’s policy, Bruyere 
6
helped conduct an examination of the status of Navy 
7
women, including career opportunities and com-
8
plaints of sexism. The study led to 9,000 sea-duty 
9
and command jobs opening up for women on 24 
10
combatant ships. 
11
(18) In 1991, Bruyere was assigned as Com-
12
manding Officer for the Navy Recruit Training 
13
Command at Orlando, Florida. At the time, it was 
14
the Navy’s only boot camp that included women. 
15
Bruyere oversaw the training of 30,000 enlistees, 
16
one third of them women. 
17
(19) In 1994, Bruyere retired from the Navy as 
18
a Captain after 28 years of service. 
19
(20) From 2012 until shortly before her death 
20
in September 2020, Bruyere was an active volunteer 
21
at Miramar National Cemetery, devoting almost 
22
4,300 hours to helping visitors locate their loved 
23
ones’ graves and providing information about vet-
24
erans’ burial benefits.

(21) Bruyere was buried at Miramar National 
1
Cemetery with full military honors. 
2
(22) In May 2021, a panel of San Diego-area 
3
members of the Armed Forces, veterans, and mili-
4
tary spouses recommended that the San Diego VA 
5
Medical Center be renamed in honor of Jennifer 
6
Moreno and an internal space be renamed in honor

of Kathleen Bruyere.
