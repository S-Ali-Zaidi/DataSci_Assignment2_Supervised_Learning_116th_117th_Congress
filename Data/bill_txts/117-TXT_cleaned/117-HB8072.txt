A BILL 
To review the termination characterization of former employ-
ees of the Department of State who were fired by reason 
of the sexual orientation of such employees, and for 
other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Lavender Offense Vic-
4
tim Exoneration Act of 2022’’ or the ‘‘LOVE Act of 
5
2022’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
7
Congress makes the following findings: 
8
00:27 Jun 18, 2022
H8072
2 
•HR 8072 IH
(1) As a consequence of the so-called ‘‘Lavender 
1
Scare’’, at least 1,000 people were wrongfully dis-
2
missed from the Department of State for alleged ho-
3
mosexuality during the 1950s and well into the 
4
1960s. 
5
(2) According to the Department of State’s Bu-
6
reau of Diplomatic Security, Department of State 
7
employees were forced out of the Department on the 
8
grounds that their sexual orientation ostensibly ren-
9
dered them vulnerable to blackmail and made them 
10
security risks. 
11
(3) In addition to those wrongfully terminated, 
12
many other patriotic Americans were prevented from 
13
joining the Department due to a screening process 
14
that was put in place to prevent the hiring of those 
15
who, according to the findings of the Bureau of Dip-
16
lomatic Security, ‘‘seemed like they might be gay or 
17
lesbian’’. 
18
(4) Congress bears a special measure of respon-
19
sibility for these discriminatory actions as the De-
20
partment’s actions were in part in response to con-
21
gressional investigations into ‘‘sex perversion of Fed-
22
eral employees’’, reports on the employment of 
23
‘‘moral perverts by Government Agencies’’, hearings 
24
and pressure placed on the Department through the 
25

•HR 8072 IH
appropriations process and congressional complaints 
1
that Foggy Bottom was rampant with homosexuals 
2
who were sympathetic to Communism and vulnerable 
3
to blackmail. 
4
(5) Between 1950 and 1969, the Department of 
5
State was required to report on the number of ho-
6
mosexuals fired each year as part of their annual ap-
7
peals before Committees on Appropriations. 
8
(6) Although the worst effects of the ‘‘Lavender 
9
Scare’’ are behind us, as recently as the early 1990s, 
10
the Department of State’s diplomatic security office 
11
was investigating State personnel thought to be gay 
12
and driving them out of government service as ‘‘se-
13
curity risks’’. 
14
(7) In 1994, Secretary of State Warren Chris-
15
topher issued a prohibition against discrimination in 
16
the Department of State, including that based on 
17
sexual orientation. 
18
(8) In 1998, President William Jefferson Clin-
19
ton signed Executive Order 13087 barring discrimi-
20
nation on the basis of sexual orientation. 
21
(9) On January 9, 2017, Secretary of State 
22
John Kerry issued a statement regarding the ‘‘Lav-
23
ender Scare’’, saying, ‘‘On behalf of the Department, 
24
I apologize to those who were impacted by the prac-
25

tices of the past and reaffirm the Department’s

2
all our employees, including members of the LGBTI

SEC. 5. ISSUANCE OF APOLOGY. 
17
(a) FINDING.—Secretary of State Kerry delivered the 
18
following apology on January 9, 2017: ‘‘Throughout my 
19
career, including as Secretary of State, I have stood 
20
strongly in support of the LGBTI community, recognizing 
21
that respect for human rights must include respect for all 
22
individuals. LGBTI employees serve as proud members of 
23
the State Department and valued colleagues dedicated to 
24
the service of our country. For the last several years, the 
25
00:27 Jun 18, 2022
H8072
9 
•HR 8072 IH
Department has pressed for the families of LGBTI offi-
1
cers to have the same protections overseas as families of 
2
other officers. In 2015, to further promote LGBTI rights 
3
throughout the world, I appointed the first ever Special 
4
Envoy for the Human Rights of LGBTI Persons. In the 
5
past—as far back as the 1940s, but continuing for dec-
6
ades—the Department of State was among many public 
7
and private employers that discriminated against employ-
8
ees and job applicants on the basis of perceived sexual ori-
9
entation, forcing some employees to resign or refusing to 
10
hire certain applicants in the first place. These actions 
11
were wrong then, just as they would be wrong today. On 
12
behalf of the Department, I apologize to those who were 
13
impacted by the practices of the past and reaffirm the De-
14
partment’s steadfast commitment to diversity and inclu-
15
sion for all our employees, including members of the 
16
LGBTI community.’’. 
17
(b) CONGRESSIONAL APOLOGY.—Congress hereby of-
18
fers a formal apology for its responsibility in encouraging 
19
the Lavender Scare and similar policies at the Department 
20
of State, as these policies were in part a response to con-
21
gressional investigations into ‘‘sex perversion of Federal 
22
employees’’, reports on the employment of ‘‘moral perverts 
23
by Government Agencies’’, and hearings or pressure other-

2
