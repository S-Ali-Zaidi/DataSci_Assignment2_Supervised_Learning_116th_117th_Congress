A BILL 
To prevent, treat, and cure tuberculosis globally. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘End Tuberculosis Now 
4
Act of 2022’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress makes the following findings: 
7
(1) Tuberculosis (referred to in the Act as 
8
‘‘TB’’) is a preventable, treatable, and curable dis-
9
ease, yet more than 25 years after the World Health 
10
Organization declared it to be a public health emer-
11
gency and called on countries to make scaling up TB

control a priority, TB remains a deadly health 
1
threat. 
2
(2) In 2019 alone, an estimated 10,000,000 
3
people became ill with TB, 10 percent of whom were 
4
children, and 1,400,000 of whom died. In order to 
5
achieve by 2035 the goals of the Political Declara-
6
tion of the High-Level Meeting of the General As-
7
sembly on the Fight Against Tuberculosis, adopted 
8
by the United Nations General Assembly October 
9
10, 2018, and of the World Health Organization 
10
End TB Strategy, adopted by the World Health As-
11
sembly in 2014, new and existing tools must be de-
12
veloped and scaled-up. 
13
(3) Over 1⁄3 of people who become ill with TB 
14
may be undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, resulting in 
15
unnecessary illness, communicable infections, and in-
16
creased mortality. 
17
(4) Since March 2020, the COVID–19 pan-
18
demic has severely disrupted TB responses in low- 
19
and middle-income countries, stalling and reversing 
20
years of progress made against TB. According to the 
21
World Health Organization, global detection dropped 
22
by 18 percent between 2019 and 2020 and an esti-
23
mated 1,300,000 fewer people were diagnosed and 
24
enrolled on TB treatment, and in some countries 
25
18:00 Sep 09, 2022
H8654
3 
•HR 8654 IH
case notifications dropped by up to 41 percent, set-
1
ting progress back by up to 12 years. 
2
(5) Failure to properly diagnose and treat TB 
3
can lead to death and can exacerbate antimicrobial 
4
resistance, a key contributor to rising cases of multi- 
5
drug-resistant TB and extensively drug-resistant 
6
TB, and increasing the probability of the introduc-
7
tion of resistant TB into new geographic areas. 
8
(6) TB programs have played a central role in 
9
responding 
to 
COVID–19, 
including 
through 
10
leveraging the expertise of medical staff with exper-
11
tise in TB and lung diseases, the repurposing of TB 
12
hospitals, and the use of the TB rapid molecular 
13
testing platforms and x-ray equipment for multiple 
14
purposes, including COVID–19. 
15
(7) With sufficient resourcing, TB program ex-
16
pertise, infection control, laboratory capacity, active 
17
case finding and contact investigation can serve as 
18
platforms for respiratory pandemic response against 
19
existing and new infectious respiratory disease with-
20
out disrupting ongoing TB programs and activities. 
21
(8) 
Globally, 
only 
about 
1⁄2
of 
the 
22
$13,000,000,000 required annually, as outlined in 
23
the Stop TB Partnership’s Global Plan to End TB, 
24
is currently available.

(9) On September 26, 2018, the United Na-
1
tions convened the first High-Level Meeting of the 
2
General Assembly on the Fight Against Tuber-
3
culosis, during which 120 countries— 
4
(A) signed a Political Declaration to accel-
5
erate progress against TB, including through 
6
commitments to increase funding for TB pre-
7
vention, diagnosis, treatment and research and 
8
development programs, and ambitious goals to 
9
successfully treat 40,000,000 people with active 
10
TB and prevent at least 30,000,000 from be-
11
coming ill with TB between 2018 and 2022; 
12
and 
13
(B) committed to ‘‘ending the epidemic in 
14
all countries, and pledge[d] to provide leader-
15
ship and to work together to accelerate our na-
16
tional and global collective actions, investments 
17
and innovations urgently to fight this prevent-
18
able and treatable disease’’, as reflected in 
19
United Nations General Assembly Resolution A/ 
20
RES/73/3. 
21
(10) The United States Government continues 
22
to be a lead funder of global TB research and devel-
23
opment, contributing 44 percent of the total

•HR 8654 IH
$915,000,000 in global funding in 2020, and can 
1
catalyze more investments from other countries. 
2
(11) Working with governments and partners 
3
around the world, USAID’s TB programming has 
4
saved 66,000,000 lives, demonstrating the effective-
5
ness of United States programs and activities. 
6
(12) On September 26, 2018, the USAID Ad-
7
ministrator announced a new performance-based 
8
Global Accelerator to End TB, aimed at catalyzing 
9
investments to meet the treatment target set by the 
10
United Nations High-Level Meeting, further dem-
11
onstrating the critical role that United States leader-
12
ship and assistance plays in the fight to eliminate 
13
TB. 
14
(13) It is essential to ensure that efforts among 
15
United States Government agencies, partner nations, 
16
international organizations, nongovernmental organi-
17
zations, the private sector, and other actors are com-
18
plementary and not duplicative in order to achieve 
19
the goal of ending the TB epidemic in all countries.
