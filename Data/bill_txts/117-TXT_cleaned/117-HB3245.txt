temperature rise, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress makes the following findings: 
2
(1) Climate change is imposing significant dam-
3
age on communities in the United States and abroad 
4
in the form of severe weather events, wildfires, heat 
5
waves, droughts, flooding, ocean acidification, and 
6
other threats to public health and safety. Scientists 
7
expect these effects to grow in frequency and inten-
8
sity in the coming decades. Low-income communities 
9
and communities of color bear a disproportionate 
10
impact of climate-related damages. 
11
(2) Collectively, the international community 
12
needs to limit global warming to under 2.7 degrees 
13
Fahrenheit above pre-industrial levels in order to 
14
avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate 
15
change. Under the current trajectory, the world will 
16
fail to meet this target and will experience warming 
17
that exceeds 3 degrees Celsius by the end of the cen-
18
tury. In many regions of the world, warming of aver-
19
age temperatures has already surpassed 3 degrees 
20
Fahrenheit. 
21
(3) To limit global warming to under 1.5 de-
22
grees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, the world 
23
needs to reach net-zero global emissions by 2050, 
24
which will require making drastic reforms to global 
25
economic systems to mitigate greenhouse gas emis-
26

sions, reduce deforestation, reduce dependency on 
1
coal, adapt to unavoidable changes in the climate, 
2
and ensure a just transition. 
3
(4) The goals articulated in the United Nations 
4
Paris Climate Agreement depend on collective action 
5
involving 
the 
entire 
international 
community. 
6
Progress made by one economic actor can be re-
7
duced or cancelled out if another economic actor 
8
emits significant greenhouse gas emissions into the 
9
Earth’s atmosphere. 
10
(5) Coal produces the highest intensity of 
11
greenhouse gas emissions of any fuel source. The 
12
International Energy Agency estimates that coal is 
13
responsible for nearly 1⁄3 of global warming. The 
14
United Nations Secretary General has repeatedly 
15
urged countries to stop financing coal and to pledge 
16
not to build new coal-fired power plants. 
17
(6) Subcritical coal-fired power plants continue 
18
to be developed, especially in Southeast Asia and as 
19
part of the Belt and Road Initiative of the People’s 
20
Republic of China, despite broad awareness of the 
21
dangers and the growing availability of economically 
22
superior alternatives. Additionally, coal mining is 
23
frequently associated with a wide range of human 
24
rights abuses, such as forced evictions and land 
25

•HR 3245 IH
grabbing, water and air pollution, and violations of 
1
the rights of indigenous people and workers. 
2
(7) Alternatives to carbon-intensive electrical 
3
power generation are now available and technological 
4
advancements continue to strengthen the economic 
5
competitiveness of such alternatives. 
6
(8) Internationally, several economic actors con-
7
tinue to pursue activities, such as development of 
8
new subcritical coal-fired power plants and deforest-
9
ation that contribute to dangerous levels of green-
10
house gas emissions. In addition to carrying a sig-
11
nificant climate risk, many of these activities are as-
12
sociated with serious human rights abuses, acts of 
13
corruption, and environmental injustice against In-
14
digenous communities, communities of color, and 
15
other communities that have historically faced 
16
marginalization and discrimination. 
17
(9) The United States Government has devel-
18
oped and implements targeted measures to restrict 
19
access to the United States financial system for spe-
20
cific individuals and entities whose actions threaten 
21
or run counter to United States national interests. 
22
The United States Government has deployed these 
23
measures in response to terrorism, proliferation of 
24
weapons of mass destruction, transnational orga-

nized crime, narcotics trafficking, malicious cyber- 
1
enabled activity, wildlife trafficking, serious human 
2
rights abuses, and acts of corruption. While Presi-
3
dent Joseph R. Biden has further centered climate 
4
solutions in foreign policy, as of the date of the en-
5
actment of this Act, the United States Government 
6
has not used these measures to target and deter 
7
reckless, climate-destroying behavior. 
8
(10) President Biden has indicated that com-
9
bating the climate crisis is a top domestic and for-
10
eign policy priority and has taken steps including 
11
the creation of a Special Presidential Envoy for Cli-
12
mate, collaborating with other countries to establish 
13
worldwide solutions and reduce the impact of climate 
14
change, striving to achieve a net-zero economy in the 
15
United States by 2050, producing a plan to end 
16
international financing for fossil fuel projects, and 
17
emphasizing the need of pursuing an entirely clean 
18
energy economy. 
19
(11) President Biden has made it a priority to 
20
counter environmental injustices in the United 
21
States and abroad, and plans on implementing com-
22
munity-led approaches as well as Federal protections 
23
and regulations that will support those community

members whose land and health have been negatively 
1
impacted by climate change. 
2
(12) The climate crisis has led to a surge of 
3
civic engagement, activism, and protests across the 
4
world. At the same time, reprisals against environ-
5
mental defenders are on the rise. Front Line De-
6
fenders reported that of the 331 human rights de-
7
fenders killed for their work in 2020, 69 percent 
8
were killed for speaking up about Indigenous, land, 
9
or environmental rights. In 2020, Global Witness re-
10
ported than an average of 4 environmental defenders 
11
had been killed every week since the Paris Climate 
12
Agreement was signed in December 2015. Thou-
13
sands of other environmental defenders are targeted 
14
each year with reprisals in the form of enforced dis-
15
appearances, torture, sexual violence, criminaliza-
16
tion, and smear campaigns. 
17
(13) As a result of corruption and illegally 
18
issued permits for forest clearance, only approxi-
19
mately 50 percent of tropical forest destruction is 
20
defined as ‘‘illegal’’ under local country laws. Criti-
21
cally, violations of land rights and the free, prior, 
22
and informed consent and rights of Indigenous peo-
23
ple can be overlooked if the only criterion applied is 
24
legality. 
25

•HR 3245 IH
(14) Illegal deforestation is a significant driver 
1
of the destruction of the Amazon rainforest. Crimi-
2
nal networks with the capacity to coordinate large- 
3
scale extraction, processing, and sale of timber de-
4
ploy armed personnel to protect their interests. 
5
Those criminal networks regularly attack and 
6
threaten members of Indigenous communities, en-
7
forcement officials, and other environmental defend-
8
ers. Perpetrators of such violence are rarely brought 
9
to justice. 
10
(15) Policies and measures to address climate 
11
change must also promote human rights, thereby ad-
12
vancing equality, justice, and dignity for all, in line 
13
with the Sustainable Development Goals of the 
14
United Nations.

encourage the governments of other countries to im-
