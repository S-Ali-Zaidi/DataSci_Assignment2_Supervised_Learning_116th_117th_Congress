(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:

•HR 3988 IH
(1) According to the 2016 Global Burden of 
1
Disease Study, an estimated 1,000,000,000 individ-
2
uals worldwide have a mental health or substance 
3
use disorder. Mental disorders are major contribu-
4
tors to the global burden of disease, and depression 
5
is among the primary causes of illness and disability 
6
in adolescents. 
7
(2) An individual’s mental health is a complex 
8
interaction between genetic, neuropsychological, and 
9
environmental factors, and environmental and social 
10
factors, from the early years through childhood and 
11
adolescence, can have long-term impacts on mental 
12
health. 
13
(3) According to a Lancet Commission report, 
14
allocations for mental health have never risen above 
15
1 percent of health-related global development as-
16
sistance. Estimates indicate that child and adoles-
17
cent mental health receives just 0.1 percent of 
18
health-related global development assistance. 
19
(4) The National Alliance on Mental Illness es-
20
timates that depression and anxiety disorders cost 
21
the global economy $1,000,000,000,000 in lost pro-
22
ductivity each year. According to Lancet, mental 
23
health disorders are projected to cost the global 
24

•HR 3988 IH
economy $16,000,000,000,000 between 2010 and 
1
2030, in part due to the early age of onset. 
2
(5) According to the World Health Organiza-
3
tion (WHO), half of mental health disorders emerge 
4
by age 14, and 14 percent of children and adoles-
5
cents worldwide experience mental health conditions, 
6
the majority of whom do not seek care, receive care, 
7
or have access to care. 
8
(6) Exposure to violence and early childhood 
9
adversity, including trauma, has been linked to neg-
10
ative, lasting effects on physical and mental health. 
11
Early childhood adversity can impact brain develop-
12
ment, nervous and immune system functioning, the 
13
onset of mental health conditions, and future behav-
14
iors. The United Nations asserts that widespread 
15
school closures due to COVID–19, which have af-
16
fected roughly 1,500,000,000 school-aged children, 
17
have placed many children at higher risk of exposure 
18
to traumas, such as household violence, abuse, ne-
19
glect, and food insecurity. 
20
(7) According to the United Nations, more than 
21
1 out of every 5 individuals in conflict-affected areas 
22
has 
a 
mental 
health 
disorder. 
Roughly 
23
1,500,000,000, or 2 out of every 3 of the world’s 
24
children under 18 years of age live in countries af-
25
18:37 Jul 19, 2021

•HR 3988 IH
fected by conflict, and more than 1 out of every 6 
1
children live in conflict zones. A greater number of 
2
children live in areas affected by armed conflict and 
3
war now than at any other point this century. The 
4
mental health burden in conflict-affected contexts is 
5
twice the global average. 
6
(8) Gender, age, disability status, race and eth-
7
nicity, and other identity characteristics contribute 
8
to different risks and needs for mental health and 
9
psychosocial support. Research has shown that 
10
harmful gender norms contribute to higher preva-
11
lence of depression and anxiety disorders in women 
12
and girls, while socialization of boys and men con-
13
tributes to higher prevalence of substance use dis-
14
orders. 
15
(9) Risks and experiences of gender-based vio-
16
lence, particularly sexual violence, are a key driver 
17
of mental health and psychosocial support needs for 
18
children. Girls account for 98 percent of verified in-
19
cidents of conflict-related sexual violence. According 
20
to the World Health Organization, 35 percent of 
21
women globally ‘‘face sexual and/or intimate partner 
22
violence in their lifetime’’ and these survivors can, 
23
according to the Centers for Disease Control and 
24
Prevention, ‘‘experience mental health problems such 
25

as depression and posttraumatic stress disorder 
1
(PTSD) symptoms’’, signifying the urgent need for 
2
age and gender-responsive mental health and psy-
3
chosocial support services. 
4
(10) According to the World Health Organiza-
5
tion, risk factors that increase susceptibility to men-
6
tal health disorders include poverty and hunger, 
7
chronic health conditions, trauma or maltreatment, 
8
social exclusion and discrimination, and exposure to 
9
and displacement by war or conflict. These risk fac-
10
tors, along with demographic risk factors, manifest 
11
at all stages in life. Preliminary research already il-
12
lustrates that the COVID–19 pandemic has in-
13
creased communities’, families’, and individuals’ risk 
14
factors for multiple types of adversity and com-
15
pounded preexisting conditions and vulnerabilities. 
16
(11) Crisis situations put parents and care-
17
givers under mental and psychosocial duress, which 
18
can prevent them from providing the protection, sta-
19
bility and nurturing care their children need during 
20
and after an emergency. The Lancet Commission es-
21
timates that between 15 and 23 percent of children 
22
globally live with a parent with a mental disorder, 
23
and parental ill health can impact the emotional and 
24
physical development of children and predispose 
25

•HR 3988 IH
these children to mental health problems. Numerous 
1
and compounding stressors and uncertainty caused 
2
by COVID–19 have exacerbated distress and further 
3
impede caregivers’ ability to provide responsive care 
4
to their children. 
5
(12) Investments in the mental health, resil-
6
ience, and well-being of the children in a country to 
7
ensure that they continue to thrive into adulthood 
8
and contribute to their societies can help break cy-
9
cles of poverty, violence, and trauma and further the 
10
country’s future potential. 
11
(13) Investments in protecting and improving 
12
mental health in a country across the life course 
13
must take into account the need to target vulnerable 
14
populations and address social, environmental, and 
15
other risk factors in conjunction with other sectors 
16
and local partners. 
17
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
18
gress that— 
19
(1) ensuring that individuals have the oppor-
20
tunity to thrive and reach their fullest potential is 
21
a critical component of sustainable international de-
22
velopment, and the global public good benefits from 
23
investment in child and adolescent mental health;

•HR 3988 IH
(2) mental health is integral and essential to 
1
overall health outcomes and other development ob-
2
jectives; 
3
(3) mental health is an issue of critical and 
4
growing importance for United States foreign assist-
5
ance that requires a coordinated strategy to ensure 
6
that programming funded by the United States Gov-
7
ernment is evidence-based, culturally competent, and 
8
trauma-informed; 
9
(4) the United States Government foreign as-
10
sistance strategy should include a mental health and 
11
psychosocial support component; 
12
(5) the redesign of the United States Agency 
13
for International Development (referred to in this 
14
Act as ‘‘USAID’’) reflects the nexus between hu-
15
manitarian and development interventions and 
16
should be applied to all mental health and psycho-
17
social support efforts of United States foreign assist-
18
ance programs; and 
19
(6) ongoing efforts to improve social service 
20
workforce development and local capacity building 
21
are essential to expanding mental health and psycho-
22
