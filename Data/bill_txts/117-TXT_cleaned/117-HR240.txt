RESOLUTION 
Calling on Azerbaijan to immediately release all prisoners 
of war and captured civilians. 
Whereas, on September 27, 2020, Azerbaijan, with support 
from Turkey and foreign militia groups, launched a mili-
tary assault on Nagorno-Karabakh, also known as 
Artsakh, resulting in the deaths of thousands and dis-
placing tens of thousands of ethnic Armenian residents; 
Whereas, on November 9, 2020, Azerbaijan, Armenia, and

Whereas in signing the November 9 statement, all parties 
agreed that the ‘‘exchange of prisoners of war, hostages 
and other detainees as well as the remains of the fatali-
ties shall be carried out’’; 
Whereas the Third Geneva Convention, of which Azerbaijan 
is a signatory, and customary international law require 
the release of prisoners of war and captured civilians 
upon the cessation of hostilities and require that all de-
tainees be treated humanely; 
Whereas, despite Azerbaijan’s obligations under the Geneva 
Conventions and their commitments in signing the No-
vember 9 statement, more than 100 days after the end 
of the conflict, the Government of Azerbaijan continues 
to detain an estimated 200 Armenian prisoners of war, 
hostages, and detained persons, misrepresenting their 
status in an attempt to justify their continued captivity; 
Whereas Human Rights Watch reported in December 2020 
that Azerbaijani military forces had mistreated ethnic Ar-
menian prisoners of war and subjected them to ‘‘physical 
abuse and humiliation’’; 
Whereas Columbia University’s Institute for the Study of 
Human Rights issued a report on the conflict that 
‘‘document[s] crimes against humanity and other atroc-
ities committed by Azerbaijani armed forces and Turkish- 
backed Islamist fighters against Armenians’’, including 
beheadings, summary executions, and the desecration of 
human remains; 
Whereas there is limited reliable information about the condi-
tion or treatment of prisoners of war and captured civil-
ians, and there is significant concern that female detain-

ees in particular could be subject to sexual assaults and 
other mistreatment; 
Whereas Azerbaijan’s continued detainment of prisoners of 
war and captured civilians calls into serious question 
their commitment to human rights and negotiating an eq-
uitable, lasting peace settlement; 
Whereas Armenia has fulfilled its obligations under the No-
vember 9 statement and international law by returning 
Azerbaijani prisoners of war; and 
Whereas the United States, along with France and Russia, 
is a co-chair of the OSCE Minsk Group which was cre-
ated to seek a durable and peaceful solution to the 
Nagorno-Karabakh conflict: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) calls upon Azerbaijan to immediately return 
2
all Armenian prisoners of war and captured civilians; 
3
and 
4
(2) urges the Secretary of State to engage at all 
5
levels with Azerbaijani authorities, including through 
6
the OSCE Minsk Group process, to make clear the 
7
importance of adhering to their obligations, under 
8
the November 9 statement and international law, to 
9
immediately release all prisoners of war and cap-
10
tured civilians.
