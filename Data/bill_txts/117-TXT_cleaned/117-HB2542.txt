SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress makes the following findings: 
2
(1) Cities, towns, and rural communities in the 
3
United States continue to face enormous challenges 
4
regarding domestic violence, sexual assault, sex traf-
5
ficking, dating violence, stalking, and other forms of 
6
intimate partner and gender-based violence. 
7
(2) One in 3 women have experienced rape, 
8
physical violence, or stalking by an intimate partner 
9
in their lifetime. 
10
(3) Approximately 7,000,000 women are raped 
11
or physically assaulted by a current or former inti-
12
mate partner each year. 
13
(4) Among women experiencing sex trafficking, 
14
many of their traffickers are also their intimate 
15
partners. 
16
(5) Each day, an average of 3 women are killed 
17
by a current or former partner. 
18
(6) Researchers estimate that domestic violence 
19
costs employers up to $13,000,000,000 each year. 
20
(7) A fundamental component of ending domes-
21
tic and sexual violence is securing safe and afford-
22
able housing for victims. 
23
(8) Research indicates that—

•HR 2542 IH
(A) nearly 50 percent of all homeless 
1
women report that domestic violence was the 
2
immediate cause of their homelessness; 
3
(B) 92 percent of homeless women report 
4
having experienced severe physical or sexual vi-
5
olence at some point in their lives, including 
6
sexual exploitation and trafficking; 
7
(C) victims become homeless as a result of 
8
sexual assault, and once homeless, are vulner-
9
able to further sexual victimization and exploi-
10
tation including sex trafficking; 
11
(D) women of color in the lowest income 
12
category experience 6 times the rate of nonfatal 
13
intimate partner violence compared to white 
14
women in the highest income category; 
15
(E) poor women of color, domestic violence 
16
victims, and women with children have a high 
17
risk of eviction; 
18
(F) vulnerable women are also at risk of 
19
sex trafficking and exploitation by landlords 
20
who pressure them for sex in exchange for rent 
21
or a delay in rent payments; and 
22
(G) approximately 38 percent of all victims 
23
of domestic violence become homeless at some 
24
point in their life.

•HR 2542 IH
(9) Surveys show that a majority of victims who 
1
experience a sexual assault in their home do not re-
2
locate to a safe environment because they do not 
3
have sufficient funds and are not aware of better op-
4
tions. 
5
(10) Domestic and sexual violence victims often 
6
find themselves trapped in homes where they are 
7
further victimized by caregivers, parents, siblings, 
8
landlords, intimate partners, neighbors, or others in 
9
or near their home. Economic insecurity and the 
10
trauma that often follows sexual violence make it 
11
difficult, if not impossible, for many victims to ac-
12
cess safe, affordable housing options for themselves 
13
and their families. 
14
(11) Domestic and sexual violence victims con-
15
tinue to face discrimination in securing and main-
16
taining housing based on their status as victims and 
17
as a result of crimes committed against them. 
18
(12) Research by the Attorney General of the 
19
State of New York found that 67 percent of domes-
20
tic violence victims reported that discrimination by 
21
landlords is a significant obstacle in obtaining hous-
22
ing. 
23
(13) Research also shows that victims of domes-
24
tic violence or sexual assault are commonly denied

housing opportunities if a previous residence of the 
1
victim was a domestic violence shelter, if the victim 
2
has secured a protective order, or if there is other 
3
evidence that the victim has experienced a previous 
4
domestic violence incident. 
5
(14) Studies show that victims of domestic vio-
6
lence or sexual assault often face eviction based on 
7
a single domestic violence incident. 
8
(15) Victims of sex trafficking face additional 
9
challenges in obtaining and maintaining housing due 
10
to criminal records incurred as a direct result of 
11
their exploitation. 
12
(16) It is in the public interest to ensure that 
13
victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, sex traf-
14
ficking, dating violence, stalking, and other forms of 
15
intimate partner and gender-based violence are not 
16
discriminated against, particularly with respect to 
17
housing, based on their status as victims or the 
18
crimes committed against them. 
19
(17) Nothing in this Act should be interpreted 
20
to limit the ability of victims of domestic violence or 
21
sexual violence to recover for claims of discrimina-
22
tion on the basis of sex or race under the Fair 
23
Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq.), including
