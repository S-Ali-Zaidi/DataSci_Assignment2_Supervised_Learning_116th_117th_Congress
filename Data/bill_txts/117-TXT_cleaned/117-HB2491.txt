SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
(1) In 1963, Congress passed on a bipartisan 
2
basis the Equal Pay Act of 1963 to prohibit dis-
3
crimination on account of sex in the payment of 
4
wages for equal work performed by employees for 
5
employers engaged in commerce or in the production 
6
of goods for commerce. 
7
(2) Following the passage of such Act, in 1964, 
8
Congress passed on a bipartisan basis the Civil 
9
Rights Act of 1964. Since the passage of both the 
10
Equal Pay Act of 1963 and the Civil Rights Act of 
11
1964, women have made significant strides, both in 
12
the workforce and in their educational pursuits. 
13
(3) Prior to the COVID–19 pandemic, there 
14
were over 77,000,000 women in the workforce, the 
15
most in American history. Of the 2,000,000 jobs 
16
created in 2019, 53 percent went to women. This 
17
follows a trend that has been rising for some time. 
18
Women are graduating from college at a higher rate 
19
than their male counter parts, making up 61 percent 
20
of all college degrees conferred in 2018. Additionally, 
21
according to a recent survey of working women, 
22
more than half are their family’s primary bread-
23
winner. 
24
(4) The COVID–19 pandemic has had a signifi-
25
cant impact on working women, resulting in over 2 
26

million women leaving the workforce since February 
1
2020. 
2
(5) Despite these advances there is still concern 
3
among the American public that gender-based wage 
4
discrimination has not been eliminated.
