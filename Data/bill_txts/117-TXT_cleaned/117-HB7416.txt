A BILL 
To amend parts B and E of title IV of the Social Security 
Act to remove barriers and encourage kinship guardian-
ship, foster, or adoptive placements for children who 
cannot be safely cared for in their own homes, and 
for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Promoting Perma-
4
nency Through Kinship Families Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:

•HR 7416 IH
(1) Reunification with parents, permanent 
1
placement with extended family members, and adop-
2
tion are all permanency options for children who are 
3
in, or at risk for entering or re-entering, foster care. 
4
(2) The estimated lifetime cost of foster youth 
5
who age out of foster care is approximately $6.9 bil-
6
lion. On an annual basis, approximately 23,000 
7
youth age out of foster care (reach the maximum 
8
age a State will support them without reunification 
9
with family or being placed in a permanent home) 
10
with no legal family ties. Over 20 percent of youth 
11
who age out of foster care become homeless, 60 per-
12
cent of sex trafficked youth come from foster care, 
13
and 25 percent of youth become involved in the 
14
criminal justice system within 2 years of aging out 
15
of foster care. When family reunification and kinship 
16
guardianship, foster, and adoptive placements are 
17
promoted and supported, children’s family connec-
18
tions and family relationships can reverse such ad-
19
verse adult outcomes. 
20
(3) Foster care is intended to be temporary. 
21
The best interests of children in safe, stable, and 
22
permanent placements are paramount. At the same 
23
time, absent aggravating circumstances, it is in the 
24
best interests of children for parents to be provided 
25

•HR 7416 IH
individualized services, supports, and time needed to 
1
address the reasons for foster care or other tem-
2
porary placements of their children. 
3
(4) Where kinship placements can safely be 
4
made, extended family members available for such 
5
placements often face financial and other barriers 
6
related to access to health and mental health serv-
7
ices and supports, crisis stabilization services, and 
8
other service supports. 
9
(5) The United States has a unique and direct 
10
interest, as trustee, in protecting the best interests 
11
of Indian children including supporting safe and per-
12
manent placements that preserve a child’s sense of 
13
belonging and connection, including to extended 
14
family when reunification with parents is not safe or 
15
possible. 
16
(b) PURPOSE.—The purposes of this Act are to pro-
17
mote kinship care as an essential permanency option for 
18
children and youth, to remove barriers to children’s safe 
19
care by relatives and fictive kin when such children cannot 
20
be safely cared for by their parents, and to support the 
21
provision of resources and services to kin caregivers.
