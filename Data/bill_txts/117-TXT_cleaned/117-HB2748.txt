•HR 2748 IH
(2) For decades, the United States Congress 
1
has promoted Israel’s acceptance among Arab states 
2
and other relevant countries and regions and has en-
3
acted numerous laws opposing efforts to boycott, iso-
4
late, and stigmatize America’s ally, Israel. 
5
(3) The recent peace and normalization agree-
6
ments between Israel and several Arab states—the 
7
United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan, and Mo-
8
rocco—have the potential to fundamentally trans-
9
form the security, diplomatic, and economic environ-
10
ment in the Middle East and North Africa and ad-
11
vance vital United States national security interests. 
12
(4) These agreements build upon the decades- 
13
long leadership of the United States Government 
14
and other governments in helping Israel broker 
15
peace treaties with Egypt and Jordan and promoting 
16
peace talks between Israel and Syria, Lebanon, and 
17
the Palestinians. 
18
(5) These agreements also build on decades 
19
long private diplomatic and security engagement be-
20
tween Israel and countries in the region. 
21
(6) These normalization and peace agreements 
22
could begin to transform the region by spurring eco-
23
nomic growth, enhancing technological innovation,

advancing understanding, and forging closer people- 
1
to-people relations.

(7) These agreements have the potential to pro-
3
mote investment, tourism, and direct flights, and 
4
promote cooperation on security, telecommuni-
5
cations, technology, energy, healthcare, culture, the 
6
environment, water security and sustainable develop-

ment.

side in peace, security, and mutual recognition; 
16
(6) to implement the Nita M. Lowey Middle 
17
East Partnership for Peace Act of 2020 (title VIII

SEC. 6. BREAKING DOWN BARRIERS TO NORMALIZATION 
6
WITH ISRAEL. 
7
(a) SHORT TITLE.—This section may be cited as the 
8
‘‘Strengthening Reporting of Actions Taken Against the 
9
Normalization of Relations with Israel Act of 2021’’. 
10
(b) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following find-
11
ings: 
12
(1) The Arab League, an organization com-
13
prising 22 Middle Eastern and African countries 
14
and entities, has maintained an official boycott of 
15
Israeli companies and Israeli-made goods since the 
16
founding of Israel in 1948. 
17
(2) Longstanding United States policy has en-
18
couraged Arab League states to normalize their rela-
19
tions with Israel and has long prioritized funding co-
20
operative programs that promote normalization be-
21
tween Arab League States and Israel, including the 
22
Middle East Regional Cooperation program, which 
23
promotes Arab-Israeli scientific cooperation. 
24
03:02 Jun 05, 2021
H2748
12 
•HR 2748 IH
(3) While some Arab League governments are 
1
signaling enhanced cooperation with the state of 
2
Israel on the government-to-government level, most 
3
continue to persecute their own citizens who estab-
4
lish people-to-people relations with Israelis in non-
5
governmental fora, through a combination of judicial 
6
and extrajudicial retribution. 
7
(4) Some Arab League states maintain draco-
8
nian anti-normalization laws that punish their citi-
9
zens for people-to-people relations with Israelis, with 
10
punishments, including imprisonment, revocation of 
11
citizenship, and execution. Extrajudicial punish-
12
ments by these and other Arab states include sum-
13
mary imprisonment, accusations of ‘‘treason’’ in gov-
14
ernment-controlled media, and professional black-
15
listing. 
16
(5) Anti-normalization laws, together with the 
17
other forms of retribution, effectively condemn these 
18
societies to mutual estrangement and, by extension, 
19
reduce the possibility of conciliation and com-
20
promise. 
21
(6) Former Israeli President Shimon Peres said 
22
in 2008 at the United Nations that Israel agrees 
23
with the Arab Peace Initiative that a military solu-
24
03:02 Jun 05, 2021
H2748
13 
•HR 2748 IH
tion to the conflict ‘‘will not achieve peace or provide 
1
security for the parties’’. 
2
(7) Despite the risk of retaliatory action, a ris-
3
ing tide of Arab civic actors advocate direct engage-
4
ment with Israeli citizens and residents. These in-
5
clude the Arab Council for Regional Integration, a 
6
group of 32 public figures from 15 Arab countries 
7
who oppose the boycott of Israel on the grounds that 
8
the boycott has denied Arabs the benefits of partner-
9
ship with Israelis, has blocked Arabs from helping to 
10
bridge the Israeli-Palestinian divide, and inspired di-
11
visive intra-Arab boycotts among diverse sects and 
12
ethnic groups. 
13
(8) On February 11, 2020, a delegation of the 
14
Arab Council to the French National Assembly in 
15
Paris testified to the harmful effects of ‘‘anti-nor-
16
malization laws’’, called on the Assembly to enact a 
17
law instructing the relevant French authorities to 
18
issue an annual report on instances of Arab govern-
19
ment retribution for any of their citizens or resi-
20
dents who call for peace with Israel or engage in di-
21
rect civil relations with Israeli citizens, and re-
22
quested democratic legislatures to help defend the 
23
region’s civil peacemakers.

14 
•HR 2748 IH
(9) On May 11, 2020, 85 leaders in France 
1
published an endorsement of the Arab Council’s pro-
2
posal, calling on France and other democratic gov-
3
ernments to ‘‘protect Arabs who engage in dialogue 
4
with Israeli citizens’’ and proposing ‘‘the creation of 
5
a study group in the National Assembly as well as 
6
in the Senate whose mission would be to ensure a 
7
legal and technical monitoring of the obstacles which 
8
Arab proponents of dialogue with Israelis face’’.

(10) Arab-Israeli cooperation provides signifi-
10
cant symbiotic benefit to the security and economic 
11
prosperity of the region.
