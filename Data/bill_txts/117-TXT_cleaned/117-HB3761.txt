logical products, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

Congress finds as follows:

H3761

•HR 3761 IH
(1) The drugs and biological products intended 
1
to be reviewed under the pathway established under 
2
this Act are for the treatment and prevention of se-
3
rious diseases or conditions, especially those for 
4
which there are no available on-label meaningful or 
5
disease-modifying treatments, where speed to access 
6
is critical. 
7
(2) The approval pathway established under 
8
this Act is intended to allow drug and biological 
9
product applications to be more rapidly reviewed by 
10
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), 
11
with the FDA reviewing various portions of new 
12
drug and biological product applications as they be-
13
come available. 
14
(3) The approval pathway established under 
15
this Act establishes a clear approval pathway that 
16
can be utilized by sponsors to receive rolling review 
17
of applications for drugs and biological products in-
18
tended to treat serious diseases, including drugs and 
19
biological products intended to treat COVID–19 that 
20
reduce the risk of death, severe disease, and progres-
21
sion of symptoms in those exposed to the virus. 
22
(4) The approval pathway established under 
23
this Act will enable sponsors to receive early, time- 
24
limited, and provisional approval for drugs and bio-
25
22:12 Jul 13, 2021

•HR 3761 IH
logical products that have demonstrated substantial 
1
evidence of safety and relevant early evidence that 
2
establishes that the drug provides a positive thera-
3
peutic outcome. 
4
(5) The approval pathway established under 
5
this Act will allow for the use of real-world evidence 
6
and scientifically substantiated surrogates, other 
7
than those previously validated by the FDA, to pre-
8
dict the clinical benefits and ultimately support pro-
9
visional approval. 
10
(6) Drugs and biological products granted pro-
11
visional approval under the pathway established 
12
under this Act are limited to a 2-year approval pe-
13
riod, renewable every 2 years, for up to 6 years. Full 
14
approval can awarded at any time, for any drug or 
15
biological product provisionally approved under this 
16
pathway that establishes a 15 percent improvement 
17
in an important endpoint compared to standard 
18
therapies. 
19
(7) The approval pathway established under 
20
this Act prohibits denial of coverage for any drug or 
21
biological product provisionally approved under this 
22
approval pathway on account of it being experi-
23
mental.

•HR 3761 IH
(8) Informed consent is required for any pa-
1
tients using a drug or biological product approved 
2
under the provisional approval pathway established 
3
under this Act. Any patients using a drug or biologi-
4
cal product reviewed under this approval pathway 
5
must participate in an observational registry until 
6
those drugs or biological products receive full ap-
7
proval, with approval contingent on registry partici-
8
pation. 
9
(9) This Act requires that registries track ag-
10
gregated, de-identified data that will be readily avail-
11
able to approved researchers for public health re-
12
search purposes. 
13
(10) This Act creates, within the Office of the 
14
Commissioner at the FDA, the position of the Pa-
15
tient Advocate General to provide assistance to pa-
16
tients and their families utilizing drugs and biologi-
17
