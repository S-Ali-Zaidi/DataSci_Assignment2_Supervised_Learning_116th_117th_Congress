Whereas animals have made significant contributions to the 
peace and protection of our United States and were offi-
cially recognized by the Quartermaster Corps on March 
13, 1942; 
Whereas there are currently over 3,000 military working dogs 
in the United States today, and there is an increasing de-
mand for these military working dogs in the United

Terror, helping to safeguard military bases and activities, 
and to detect bombs and explosives before they inflict 
harm; 
Whereas canines are used today to maintain peace and pro-
tection with numerous law enforcement, fire, and search

States are currently not recognized for their acts of gal-
lantry and bravery, and do not have an official medal to
