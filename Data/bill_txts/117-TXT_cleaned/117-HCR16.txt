Republic of China, and for other purposes.

of China, as the host city of the 2022 Olympic Winter 
Games; 
Whereas the Olympic charter states the goal of Olympism is 
to promote ‘‘a peaceful society concerned with the preser-
vation of human dignity’’; 
Whereas, according to the September 2020 House of Rep-
resentatives China Task Force Report, the Government 
of China is the leading human rights abuser in the world, 
depriving 1,400,000,000 human beings of their funda-
mental rights; 
Whereas, since 2017, the Government of China has detained 
and persecuted up to 1,800,000 Turkic Muslims, includ-
ing ethnic Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and Kyrgyz, in ‘‘political 
re-education’’ centers, and many detainees who have not 
‘‘graduated’’ from the facilities have been convicted of 
formal crimes and sentenced to prison terms; 
Whereas detained and imprisoned Muslim minorities in the 
Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region are held arbitrarily 
and without due process, coerced to disavow religious be-
liefs and cultural practices, forced to work in factories, 
deprived of food and other essential needs, and subjected 
to physical abuse, including torture and alleged organ 
harvesting; 
Whereas the Government of China is implementing a policy 
of employing large numbers of Uyghurs, including former 
detainees, in labor-intensive factories in Xinjiang and 
elsewhere in China under forced labor conditions;

Whereas according to the Australian Strategic Policy Insti-
tute, an estimated 8,500 mosques have been demolished 
in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, and nearly 
30 percent of Islamic shrines, cemeteries, and other sites 
of religious importance in the region have been damaged 
or destroyed, mostly since 2017; 
Whereas Article 2 of the 1948 United Nations Convention on 
the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Geno-
cide, which both the United States and China have rati-
fied, defines genocide as ‘‘any of the following acts com-
mitted with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a na-
tional, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such: (a) kill-
ing members of the group; (b) causing serious bodily or 
mental harm to members of the group; (c) deliberately in-
flicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring 
about its physical destruction in whole or in part; (d) im-
posing measures intended to prevent births within the 
group; [or] (e) forcibly transferring children of the group 
to another group.’’; 
Whereas, on January 19, 2021, the Department of State de-
termined that the Government of China, under the direc-
tion and control of the Chinese Communist Party, ‘‘has 
committed genocide against the predominantly Muslim 
Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious minority groups 
in Xinjiang’’, and on the same day, Secretary of State 
Antony Blinken agreed, stating, ‘‘forcing men, women 
and children into concentration camps, trying to in effect 
re-educate them to be adherents to the Chinese Com-
munist Party—all of that speaks to an effort to commit 
genocide’’; 
Whereas, in June 2020, the legislature of China passed a na-
tional security law for Hong Kong restricting basic polit-

ical rights and authorizing severe punishments for anyone 
inside or outside Hong Kong found guilty of broad vague-
ly defined crimes, effectively ending the longstanding 
‘‘one country, two systems’’ policy; 
Whereas, in September 2020, the House Foreign Affairs 
Committee Minority Staff Report on the origins of the 
COVID–19 global pandemic found that— 
(1) authorities in China harassed, detained, and dis-
appeared individuals who told the truth about the Chi-
nese Communist Party’s handling of the COVID–19 pan-
demic; 
(2) during the early outbreak of the COVID–19 pan-
demic, the Government of China failed to meet an inter-
national legal requirement to inform the World Health 
Organization of the COVID–19 outbreak in Wuhan, 
Hubei Province, China; 
(3) during the early stages of the COVID–19 pan-
demic, the Government of China knew of the deadly 
human-to-human transmission capabilities of the virus 
and took steps to hide it from the public and global com-
munity; and 
(4) in February 2020, the Government of China na-
tionalized their medical supply chain to stockpile personal 
protective equipment and stop foreign exports to other 
countries battling the COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas, in October 2020, United Kingdom Foreign Sec-
retary Dominic Raab stated, regarding a potential boy-
cott of the 2022 Winter Olympics due to human rights 
violations against the Uyghurs, that ‘‘my instinct is to 
separate sport from diplomacy and politics, but there 
comes a point where that may not be possible’’;

Olympic Committee requesting the committee ‘‘reverse its 
mistake in awarding Beijing the honor of hosting the 
Winter Olympic Games in 2022’’; 
Whereas, in November 2020, the Australian Parliament de-
bated a motion calling on the ‘‘Australian Government to 
work with the Australian Olympic Committee to ensure 
Australia boycotts the 2022 Winter Olympics games in 
Beijing’’; 
Whereas, in January 2020, the editorial board of The Wash-
ington Post opposed the Government of China hosting 
the 2022 Winter Olympics and stated, ‘‘the world must 
ask whether China, slowly strangling an entire people, 
has the moral standing to host the 2022 Winter Olympic 
Games. We think not.’’; 
Whereas, in 1980, in H. Con. Res. 249, the House of Rep-
resentatives voted 386 to 12, and the Senate voted 88 to 
4, to urge the United States Olympic Committee to pro-
pose the transfer or cancellation of the 1980 Summer 
Olympics in Moscow; to urge the International Olympic 
Committee to adopt such a proposal; and, if the Inter-
national Olympic Committee rejected the proposal, to 
urge the United States Olympic Committee and those of 
other countries not to participate in the Games and to 
conduct alternative games of their own, due to concerns 
over the Soviet Union’s invasion of Afghanistan; and 
Whereas since the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing, 
the human rights record and global authoritarian influ-
ence of China have severely worsened and do not meet 
the values of Olympism: Now, therefore, be it
