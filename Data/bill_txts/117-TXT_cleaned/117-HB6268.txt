SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds as follows: 
7
(1) The United States Commission on Civil 
8
Rights (USCCR) advises Congress, as well as the 
9
President and the American public, on ‘‘discrimina-
10
tion or denials of equal protection of the laws under 
11
the Constitution of the United States because of 
12
color, race, religion, sex, age, disability, or national 
13
origin, or in the administration of justice’’. 
14
(2) The USCCR routinely has difficulties col-
15
lecting information from Federal agencies despite 
16
having the power to take depositions, issue interrog-
17
atories and subpoenas, and broad authority language 
18
for the collection of information from Federal agen-
19
cies. 
20
(3) The activities mandated herein for the 
21
USCCR are explicitly authorized by section 3 of the 
22
Civil Rights Commission Act of 1983 (42 U.S.C. 
23
1975a).

16
clearly, in the troubling conditions for Black women

18

19
dren of color with disabilities. 
20
(7) Black girls are suspended and expelled from 
21
school at rates that exceed other girls and all other

23
(8) 40 percent of all suspected human traf-

ficking victims in the U.S. are Black, and Black
