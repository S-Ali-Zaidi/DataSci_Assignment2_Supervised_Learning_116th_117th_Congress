SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Cady Housh and 
2
Gemesha Thomas Student Suicide Prevention Act of 
3
2021’’. 
4
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
5
Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) In the last 12 years, suicide has been on the 
7
increase, moving up to the second leading cause of 
8
death for young people between the ages of 10 and 
9
34 with about 157,000 youth treated at emergency 
10
departments for self-inflicted injuries. Between 2007 
11
and 2018, the national suicide rate among persons 
12
ages 1 to 24 increased 57.4 percent. 
13
(2) According to the 2019 Youth Risk Behav-
14
iors Survey of the Centers for Disease Control and 
15
Prevention, 18.8 percent of high school students re-
16
ported seriously considering suicide, and 8.9 percent 
17
reporting attempting to take their lives during that 
18
period. 
19
(3) Eighty percent of students show warning 
20
signs before attempting suicide. 
21
(4) Prevention and awareness training will 
22
equip individuals to become aware of the warning 
23
signs of suicide, identify students in crisis, and pro-
24
vide resources for help.

(5) Research shows that inquiring about suicide 
1
ideation, or discussing suicide in terms of recog-
2
nizing risk factors and prevention methods— 
3
(A) does not increase the chance of suicide; 
4
and 
5
(B) in fact, can lower the risk of suicide. 
6
(6) Sexual minority youth (LGBTQ) are almost 
7
five times more likely to have attempted suicide com-
8
pared to their heterosexual peers. In addition, 40 
9
percent of LGBTQ youth seriously considered at-
10
tempting suicide in the past 12 months, with more 
11
than half of transgender and nonbinary youth hav-
12
ing seriously considered suicide. 
13
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
14
It is the sense of the Congress that— 
15
(1) student suicide awareness, prevention train-
16
ing, and response materials should be available to all 
17
school personnel, including administrative personnel, 
18
teachers, counselors, and other school leaders; 
19
(2) States should give autonomy to each local 
20
educational agency to— 
21
(A) adopt a policy with respect to student 
22
suicide awareness and prevention; and 
23
(B) work collaboratively with local organi-
24
zations, youth mental health experts, health

7

8

2
(5) students who receive such training should 
3

4
educated on how to—

6
sion; 
7
