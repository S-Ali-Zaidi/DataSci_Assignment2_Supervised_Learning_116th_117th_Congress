Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious minority groups 
in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region; 
Whereas the 2020 Trafficking in Persons Report of the De-
partment of State relating to the People’s Republic of 
China indicates that— 
(1) authorities in the People’s Republic of China 
have arbitrarily detained more than 1,000,000 ethnic 
Muslims, including Uyghurs, ethnic Hui, ethnic Kazakh, 
and ethnic Kyrgyz individuals, in as many as 1,200 ‘‘vo-
cational training centers’’, which are internment camps 
designed to erase ethnic and religious identities; 
(2) the national household registry system of the 
People’s Republic of China restricts the freedom of rural 
inhabitants to legally change their workplace or resi-
dence, placing the internal migrant population of the 
People’s Republic of China at high risk of forced labor 
in brick kilns, coal mines, and factories; 
(3) the Government of the People’s Republic of 
China subjects Christians and members of other religious 
groups to forced labor in brick kilns, food processing cen-
ters, and factories as part of detention for the purpose 
of ideological indoctrination; and 
(4) the Government of the People’s Republic of 
China provides financial incentives, including subsidies, 
for companies to open factories near the internment 
camps, and local governments receive additional funds 
from the Government of the People’s Republic of China 
for each inmate forced to work in an internment camp; 
Whereas, in June 2020, the Associated Press reported that— 
(1) the Government of the People’s Republic of 
China uses forced birth control, sterilizations, and abor-

tions on Uyghur and other minority women to diminish 
the birth rate among Muslim populations; and 
(2) Uyghur and other minority women are subjected 
to internment camps and large fines for having too many 
children, which is subjectively defined by the Government 
of the People’s Republic of China; 
Whereas, in October 2019, Radio Free Asia reported that— 
(1) the Government of the People’s Republic of 
China, as part of its Pair Up and Become Family pro-
gram, assigns male Han Chinese ‘‘relatives’’ to monitor 
the homes of Uyghur families in the Xinjiang Uyghur 
Autonomous Region and to regularly sleep in the same 
beds as the wives of men detained in the internment 
camps of the region; and 
(2) Uyghur individuals who protest hosting ‘‘rel-
atives’’ or refuse to take part in study sessions or other 
activities with the officials in their homes are subject to 
additional restrictions and may face detention in the in-
ternment camps; 
Whereas, in July 2019, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, 
Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, 
Ireland, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the 
Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Sweden, 
Switzerland, and the United Kingdom jointly condemned 
the arbitrary detention and surveillance of Uyghur indi-
viduals and other minorities in the Xinjiang Uyghur Au-
tonomous Region; 
Whereas, in March 2020, the Independent Tribunal Into 
Forced Organ Harvesting from Prisoners of Conscience

nificant scale, and practitioners of Falun Gong have been 
the main source of organs; 
(2) Christians and Tibetan Buddhists have over the 
past decade been a key source of forced labor while en-
during incarceration; and 
(3) the Government of the People’s Republic of 
China has committed crimes against humanity with re-
spect to Uyghur individuals and practitioners of Falun 
Gong; 
Whereas the report of Freedom House entitled ‘‘Freedom in 
the World 2019’’ indicates that— 
(1) women, ethnic and religious minorities, and the 
LGBT community in the People’s Republic of China have 
no opportunity to gain meaningful political representation 
and are barred from advancing their interests outside the 
formal structures of the Communist Party of China; 
(2) foreign journalists in the People’s Republic of 
China were surveilled, harassed, physically abused, de-
tained to prevent meetings with certain individuals, and 
had their visas withheld; 
(3) hundreds of Falun Gong practitioners have re-
cently received long prison terms, and many other indi-
viduals were arbitrarily detained in various ‘‘legal edu-
cation’’ facilities, where they were tortured, sometimes fa-
tally, until they abandoned their beliefs; 
(4) limitations on due process in the People’s Re-
public of China, including the excessive use of pretrial de-
tention, are rampant, and an extended crackdown on 
human rights lawyers has weakened the access of defend-
ants to independent legal counsel; and 
(5) individuals attempting to petition the Govern-
ment of the People’s Republic of China with respect to 
grievances or injustices are routinely intercepted in their

hometowns, or subjected to extralegal detention in ‘‘black 
jails’’, psychiatric institutions, and other sites at which 
they are at risk of abuse; 
Whereas the annual report of the United States Congres-
sional-Executive Commission on China for 2019 indicates 
that— 
(1) the one-party authoritarian political system of 
the People’s Republic of China deprives the people of the 
People’s Republic of China of their right to meaningfully 
participate in electoral processes and public life generally; 
(2) in 2019, the Government of the People’s Repub-
lic of China detained and prosecuted individuals who 
criticized government officials and policies online and 
censored or distorted a range of news and information 
that the Government of the People’s Republic of China 
considered ‘‘politically sensitive’’, including— 
(A) the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen 
Square massacre; 
(B) human rights abuses in the Xinjiang 
Uyghur Autonomous Region; and 
(C) the protests in Hong Kong against pro-
posed extradition legislation; 
(3) Hong Kong authorities, under the influence of 
the Government of the People’s Republic of China, vio-
lated fundamental freedoms of the people of Hong Kong,

cial Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of 
China (referred to in this preamble as the ‘‘Basic Law’’), 
including the freedoms of expression, association, and as-

protests, attributing the protests to influence by ‘‘foreign 
forces’’, and threatening protesters in Hong Kong; 
(5) officials of the Government of the People’s Re-
public of China and the Communist Party of China con-
tinue to abuse criminal law and police power to punish 
critics and ‘‘maintain stability’’ with the goal of perpet-
uating one-party rule, often targeting human rights advo-
cates, religious believers, and ethnic minority groups; and 
(6) the Government of the People’s Republic of 
China is likely committing crimes against humanity; 
Whereas before the 2008 Summer Olympics were held in Bei-
jing, the Department of State Country Reports on 
Human Rights Practices for 2006 reported that the Gov-
ernment of the People’s Republic of China practiced se-
vere cultural and religious repression of minorities, espe-
cially of Uyghur individuals in the Xinjiang Uyghur Au-
tonomous Region, and according to the Department of 
State Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 
2018, such repression has intensified since the 2008 
Summer Olympics in Beijing; 
Whereas four Special Rapporteurs of the United Nations 
have urged the governing authorities in Hong Kong and

semble, including— 
(1) the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expres-
sion; 
(2) the Special Rapporteur on the situation of

(3) the Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom 
of peaceful assembly and of association; and 
(4) the Special Rapporteur on torture and other 
cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment; 
Whereas police in Hong Kong have arrested more than 6,000 
individuals and fired more than 16,000 rounds of tear 
gas during the 7 months of protests by people of Hong 
Kong seeking to uphold their liberties and the autonomy 
of Hong Kong, as articulated in the Basic Law; 
Whereas the Law of the People’s Republic of China on Safe-
guarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region (referred to in this preamble as 
the ‘‘Hong Kong National Security Law’’) has been re-
peatedly implemented to suppress prodemocracy dem-
onstrators and remove the rights and liberties from the 
people of Hong Kong guaranteed in the Basic Law; 
Whereas the report of the Network of Chinese Human Rights 
Defenders entitled ‘‘Defending Rights in a ‘No Rights 
Zone’: Annual Report on the Situation of Human Rights 
Defenders in China (2018)’’ indicates that— 
(1) authorities in the People’s Republic of China 
continue to charge Tibetans with ‘‘inciting separatism’’ 
for expressing political or religious dissent and impose 
heavy prison sentences on such individuals; 
(2) the Government of the People’s Republic of 
China continues to implement its draconian 2017 cyber-
security law, which authorizes invasive cyber surveillance 
and provides broad authority to restrict and penalize on-
line expression; 
(3) the Government of the People’s Republic of 
China intended to have ‘‘full coverage, connectivity, and

(4) the Government of the People’s Republic of 
China boldly retaliates against human rights advocates 
for their work upholding international standards and co-
operating with the United Nations human rights mecha-
nisms; 
Whereas, in January 2020, the editorial board of The Wash-
ington Post questioned whether the People’s Republic of 
China should ‘‘be allowed to host the 2022 Winter Olym-
pics in one city while running concentration camps in an-
other’’; and 
Whereas the flagrant human rights abuses committed by the 
Government of the People’s Republic of China are incon-
sistent with Olympic values: Now, therefore, be it
