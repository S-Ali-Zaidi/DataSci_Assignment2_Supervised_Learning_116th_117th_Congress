SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Healthy People 2030 defines social deter-
3
minants of health as conditions in the environments 
4
where people are born, live, learn, work, play, wor-
5
ship, and age that affect a wide range of health, 
6
functioning, and quality-of-life outcomes and risks. 
7
(2) One of the overarching goals of Healthy 
8
People 2030 is to ‘‘create social, physical, and eco-
9
nomic environments that promote attaining the full 
10
potential for health and well-being for all’’. 
11
(3) Healthy People 2030 developed a ‘‘place- 
12
based’’ organizing framework, reflecting five key 
13
areas of social determinants of health namely— 
14
(A) economic stability; 
15
(B) education access and quality; 
16
(C) social and community context; 
17
(D) health care access and quality; and 
18
(E) neighborhood and built environment. 
19
(4) It is estimated that medical care accounts 
20
for only 10 to 20 percent of the modifiable contribu-
21
tors to healthy outcomes for a population. 
22
(5) The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Serv-
23
ices has indicated the importance of the social deter-
24
minants in its work stating that, ‘‘As we seek to fos-
25
ter innovation, rethink rural health, find solutions to 
26

•HR 379 IH
the opioid epidemic, and continue to put patients 
1
first, we need to take into account social deter-
2
minants of health and recognize their importance.’’. 
3
(6) The Department of Health and Human 
4
Services’ Public Health 3.0 initiative recognizes the 
5
role of public health in working across sectors on so-
6
cial determinants of health, as well as the role of 
7
public health as chief health strategist in commu-
8
nities. 
9
(7) Through its Health Impact in 5 Years ini-
10
tiative, the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
11
tion has highlighted nonclinical, community-wide ap-
12
proaches that show positive health impacts, results 
13
within five years, and cost-effectiveness or cost-sav-
14
ings over the lifetime of the population or earlier. 
15
(8) Health departments and the Centers for 
16
Disease Control and Prevention are not funded for 
17
such cross-cutting work.
