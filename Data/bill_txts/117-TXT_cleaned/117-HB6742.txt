(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
5

7

8
Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, the 
9
Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Estonia, Latvia and Lith-
10
uania) in NATO are at a heightened threat of Rus-
11
sian military aggression. As security partners and 
12
NATO allies, the United States provides defense ar-
13
ticles, services, design and construction services, and 
14
major defense equipment under the Arms Export 
15
Control Act and in accordance with the Foreign As-
16
sistance Act. 
17
(2) There is an urgent need to provide for these 
18
defense articles and services as a result of the emer-
19
gency security situation created by Russia’s desta-
20
bilizing military presence in and around Ukraine. 
21
This military buildup poses a threat of a potential 
22
military invasion, and hybrid attack, including 
23
cyberattacks, political subversion and paramilitary 
24
activity. A military invasion, which may include non- 
25
conventional warfare, would potentially result in in-

(1) notwithstanding any other provision of law, 
7

(2) the President shall waive appropriate 
14
charges, including for administrative services, a pro-
15
portionate amount of any nonrecurring costs, and 
16
the recovery of ordinary inventory losses associated 
17
with the sale from stocks, or replacement if the arti-

STRATEGY 
FOR 
COOPERATION 
ON 
INTER-
4
MEDIATE-RANGE MISSILE LAUNCHERS AND 
5
SYSTEMS TO NATO ALLIES. 
6
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) All NATO allies agree that the SSC–8/ 
8
9M729 missile system developed and deployed by the 
9
Government of Russia violated the Intermediate- 
10
Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (in this section re-
11
ferred to as the ‘‘INF Treaty’’), while posing a sig-
12
nificant risk to NATO security. 
13
(2) Despite NATO allies’ repeated calls on the 
14
Government of Russia to return to full and verifiable 
15
compliance with the INF Treaty, Russia continued 
16
to develop and deploy INF Treaty-violating systems, 
17
which led to the INF Treaty’s demise on August 2, 
18
2019. 
19
(3) As of the INF Treaty’s demise, Russia had 
20
produced and deployed multiple battalions of INF 
21
Treaty-violating missiles, capable of reaching key 
22
European capitals and targets. 
23
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—A mutual deployment 
24
moratorium in the European theater with the Russian 
25
21:47 Mar 07, 2022
H6742
75 
•HR 6742 IH
Federation is not in the interest of the United States. 
1
Even if a European-Theater intermediate-range ground- 
2
launched missile deployment moratorium were verifiable, 
3
any such moratorium would significantly advantage Rus-
4
sia and disadvantage NATO. This is due to the Russian 
5
Federation’s continual threats of aggression against sov-
6
ereign European nations, the relative ease by which Russia 
7
could deploy such systems to the theater, and the logistical 
8
impediments with which the United States and NATO 
9
would have to contend should it be determined a commen-
10
surate response was warranted. 
11
(c) STRATEGY.—Not later than 90 days after the 
12
date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense 
13
and the Secretary of State shall jointly develop and submit 
14
to the appropriate committees of Congress a strategy to 
15
cooperate with willing NATO member countries in the 
16
joint research, development, training and possible transfer 
17
of conventional intermediate-range ground-launched mis-
18
siles, associated launchers and support equipment, and as-
19
sociated technology. 
20
(d) APPROPRIATE COMMITTEES OF CONGRESS DE-
21
FINED.—In this section, the term ‘‘appropriate commit-
22
tees of Congress’’ means—

24
the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate; and

Nothing in this section shall be construed to supersede or

otherwise affect section 130h of title 10, United States
