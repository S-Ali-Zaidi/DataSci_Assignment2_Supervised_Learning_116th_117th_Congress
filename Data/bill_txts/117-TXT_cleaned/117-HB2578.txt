SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may cited as the ‘‘Paris Transparency and 
2
Accountability Act’’. 
3
SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT THE UNITED STATES 
4
SHOULD NOT REENTER THE PARIS AGREE-
5
MENT ABSENT FURTHER NEGOTIATIONS AND 
6
ADVICE AND CONSENT TO RATIFICATION OF 
7
THE UNITED STATES SENATE. 
8
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
9
(1) On May 9, 1992, the United States Senate 
10
provided its advice and consent to ratification re-
11
garding the United Nations Framework Convention 
12
on Climate Change (Framework Convention), which 
13
entered into force on March 21, 1994. 
14
(2) The Framework Convention was ratified 
15
under the express limitation that a decision by the 
16
Conference of the Parties to adopt targets and time-
17
tables would have to be submitted to the Senate for 
18
its advice and consent. 
19
(3) The Kyoto Protocol, completed at the 3d 
20
Conference of the Parties (COP) to the Framework 
21
Convention in December 1997 in Kyoto, Japan, con-
22
tains emissions targets and timetables, and was 
23
signed by the Clinton Administration on behalf of 
24
the United States but never submitted to the Senate 
25
for its advice and consent to ratification.

•HR 2578 IH
(4) The United Nations Climate Change 
1
website states: ‘‘The Paris Agreement is a legally 
2
binding international treaty on climate change.’’. 
3
And yet this United Nations designated ‘‘legally 
4
binding international treaty’’ has never been sub-
5
mitted to the United States Senate for advice and 
6
consent as required of treaties under article II, sec-
7
tion 2 of the Constitution. 
8
(5) The Paris Agreement and every article and 
9
clause thereof was accepted by President Barack 
10
Obama on behalf of the United States solely through 
11
executive action, rather than submitted to the Sen-
12
ate for its advice and consent to ratification. 
13
(6) Implementation of the Paris Agreement 
14
would serve as justification for pursuing unilateral 
15
and punitive policies harmful to United States eco-
16
nomic competitiveness, including significant job loss, 
17
increased energy and consumer costs, risks to grid 
18
reliability, or any combination thereof. 
19
(7) When originally negotiating the Paris 
20
Agreement, incoming Special Presidential Envoy for 
21
Climate John Kerry stated, if . . . ‘‘all the indus-
22
trial nations went down to zero emissions, it 
23
wouldn’t be enough, not when more than 65 percent 
24
22:33 Jun 08, 2021
H2578

•HR 2578 IH
of the world’s carbon pollution comes from the devel-
1
oping world’’. 
2
(8) The Paris Agreement allows the People’s 
3
Republic of China, the world’s second largest econ-
4
omy and largest emitter of greenhouse gasses, to 
5
continue as a developing country, and therefore jus-
6
tify energy and industrial policies that undermine 
7
the economic and security interests of the United 
8
States and its allies, and significantly increase emis-
9
sions in the foreseeable future. 
10
(9) The People’s Republic of China is on track 
11
to increase its emissions by roughly 50 percent by 
12
2030, consistent with the 2014 agreement with the 
13
Obama Administration and its pledge under the 
14
Paris Agreement. 
15
(10) Since 2005 the People’s Republic of China 
16
increased emissions by four tons for every ton of 
17
emissions reduced by the United States during the 
18
same period. 
19
(11) To protect the interests of the United 
20
States and its citizens, prior to its submission to the 
21
United States Senate for its advice and consent to 
22
ratification, the Paris Agreement should be renegoti-
23
ated or new agreement negotiated to ensure the Peo-
24
ple’s Republic of China reduces greenhouse gas 
25
22:33 Jun 08, 2021
H2578
5 
•HR 2578 IH
emissions at a pace and scale equivalent to that of 
1
the United States. 
2
(12) Through innovation and free market 
3
forces, the United States has reduced its carbon di-
4
oxide emissions more than any other country in the 
5
world, including the next 12 emissions-reducing 
6
countries combined over the past 15 years. 
7
(13) Between 1994 and 2018, global green-
8
house gas emissions grew significantly despite nearly 
9
a quarter century of international climate agree-
10
ments and in spite of the United States, the Euro-
11
pean Union and other Organisation for Economic 
12
Co-operation and Development (OECD) and G7 na-
13
tions reducing their emissions during the same time 
14
period. 
15
(14) The emissions reduction goals of the Paris 
16
Agreement cannot be met without the development 
17
and global deployment of affordable energy tech-
18
nologies, including storage, nuclear, and clean fossil 
19
technologies, as well as commercial-scale carbon, 
20
capture, utilization, and storage technologies. 
21
(15) American economic growth and prosperity 
22
is essential to the development and deployment of 
23
these technologies to address global energy security 
24
and reduction of global emissions. Punitive policies 
25
22:33 Jun 08, 2021
H2578
6 
•HR 2578 IH
such as taxes, mandates and regulations that in-
1
crease the cost of energy and American manufac-
2
turing will divert resources from the innovation of 
3
affordable technologies necessary to reduce global 
4
emissions. 
5
(16) Global competitors to exported American 
6
liquified natural gas, such as Russian produced nat-
7
ural gas, have lifecycle emissions up to 50 percent 
8
higher than American exported liquified natural gas, 
9
and domestic policies such as taxes, mandates, regu-
10
lations or banning of the domestically produced en-
11
ergy resource will result in higher global emissions 
12
and run counter to the goals of international efforts 
13
to reduce emissions all while hurting America’s com-
14
petitiveness, security, and economic interests. 
15
(17) The United States withdrew from the 
16
Paris Agreement, pursuant to the terms of the 
17
Agreement, which President Donald J. Trump first 
18
announced on June 1, 2017, and took effect on No-
19
vember 4, 2020. 
20
(18) On January 20, 2021, President Joseph 
21
R. Biden, Jr., signed an Executive order providing 
22
for the United States to reenter the Paris Agree-
23
ment.
