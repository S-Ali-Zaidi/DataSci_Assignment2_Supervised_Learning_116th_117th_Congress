•HR 3950 IH
(1) Medical-Legal Partnerships (hereinafter re-
1
ferred to as MLPs) are holistic care models that in-
2
tegrate legal expertise and services into health care 
3
settings or delivery systems to address underpinning 
4
social and legal needs that negatively affect the 
5
health outcomes of veterans and their families. 
6
(2) MLPs build upon the traditional legal clinic 
7
model by leveraging the unique, historical collabora-
8
tions between legal services organizations and med-
9
ical providers. 
10
(3) Among other things, MLPs screen for, and 
11
then aim to resolve legal issues veterans present, 
12
that may include income security issues, unsafe 
13
housing, impending evictions, family law matters, 
14
benefit concerns, elder abuse, and guardianship 
15
issues. Especially during the COVID–19 pandemic, 
16
these needs were also shown to have direct implica-
17
tion on population health and the stability of our 
18
economy. 
19
(4) In addition to providing direct legal serv-
20
ices, MLPs help to improve quality and increase 
21
value in health care delivery systems by engaging in 
22
activities such as trainings for clinical teams and 
23
helping health care providers optimize their services.

(5) MLPs have experienced steady growth and 
1
reach since they were first developed in the mid- 
2
1990s. In 2020 alone, some 450 MLPs in 49 States 
3
helped more than 75,000 individuals resolve health- 
4
harming legal needs. In recent years, MLPs have 
5
flourished as effective models of care for veterans. 
6
(6) Veterans are disproportionately at higher 
7
risk for health problems, many of which are exacer-
8
bated by unmet social and legal needs. The percent-
9
age of veterans who have at least one disability is 
10
double that of non-veterans, and 41 percent of vet-
11
erans have mental health conditions such as depres-
12
sion, traumatic brain injury, post-traumatic stress 
13
disorder (PTSD), and substance use disorder. 
14
(7) Veterans are also at higher risk of having 
15
legal issues, with one recent study finding an aver-
16
age of 1.5 legal issues per veteran. The most com-
17
mon civil legal needs included lack of access to VA 
18
benefits, custodial issues, and housing issues like 
19
eviction. Unmet legal needs are particularly harmful 
20
to the more than 1.7 million veterans with family in-
21
comes below 125 percent of Federal poverty level. In 
22
fact, a 2017 analysis found that civil legal problems 
23
related to veterans’ issues affected 13 percent of 
24
low-income households with veterans or other mili-
25

tary personnel. For these households, the most com-
1
mon legal problems were in the areas of health or 
2
health care, consumer finance issues, and employ-
3
ment. 
4
(8) MLPs have proven to be a successful model 
5
of addressing issues related to veteran care. One 
6
study found that Veterans who received treatment at 
7
MLPs showed significant mental health improve-
8
ment and even improvements in their housing and 
9
income. Additionally, MLPs have been found to de-
10
crease readmission rates, length of inpatient hospital 
11
stays, and visits to the emergency room. 
12
(9) In Indiana, a 2018 grant from Indiana De-
13
partment of Veterans Affairs made possible an MLP 
14
between Veteran Health Indiana and Indiana Legal 
15
Services, Inc. and enabled veterans to access critical 
16
civil legal services they may not otherwise have re-
17
ceived. 
18
(10) A study assessed 4 MLPs in Connecticut 
19
and New York and found that 75 percent of vet-
20
erans reached their legal goal in the one-year study 
21
period, and in the first three months, those who re-
22
ceived full legal representation showed significant re-
23
ductions in symptoms of hostility, paranoia, psy-

chosis, generalized anxiety disorder, and posttrau-
1
matic stress disorder. 
2
(11) In 2017, a study designed to evaluate an 
3
MLP at UMass Memorial Hospital found that pa-
4
tients referred by healthcare workers to Legal Aid 
5
commonly had other legal problems which the attor-
6
neys could also help them address and 86 percent of 
7
clients said they would use the program again. 
8
(12) Currently, the overwhelming majority of 
9
MLPs operate in Federal veteran’s facilities. States 
10
operate hundreds of veteran’s homes, treatment fa-
11
cilities, and support programs that do not have 
12
MLPs or access to civil legal providers.
