SEC. 4. PROTECTION OF OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES OF 
4
THE UNITED STATES. 
5
(a) FINDINGS.— Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) Officers and employees of the United States 
7
Government dutifully and faithfully serve the United 
8
States, often placing themselves at serious risk of 
9
death or bodily harm, in order to preserve, protect, 
10
and defend the interests of the United States. 
11
(2) In prohibiting the assaulting, resisting, or 
12
impeding of officers and employees of the United 
13
States Government, Congress intended to maximize 
14
protection for Federal officers and employees and 
15
ensure that individuals who kill or assault Federal 
16
officers or employees are prosecuted. 
17
(3) The United States Court of Appeals for the 
18
Sixth Circuit analyzed section 111 of title 18, 
19
United States Code, correctly when it found, ‘‘Cat-
20
egorizing § 111(a)(1) as a general intent crime fur-
21
thers the congressional objective: ‘If a person acts in 
22
a manner which is assaultive toward a federal offi-
23
cial, without specifically intending harm or the ap-
24
prehension of imminent harm, the official still would

be impeded in the performance of his official du-
1
ties.’ ’’ United States v. Kimes, 246 F.3d 800, 809 
2
(6th Cir. 2001), quoting United States v. Jennings, 
3
855 F. Supp. 1427, 1440 (M.D. Pa. 1994). 
4
(4) Federal courts, including the United States 
5
Courts of Appeals for the Second, Fourth, Sixth, 
6
Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits, have 
7
correctly interpreted section 111 of title 18, United 
8
States Code, to be a crime of general intent rather 
9
than a crime of specific intent. 
10
(5) Other Federal courts, including the United 
11
States Courts of Appeals for the First, Fifth, and 
12
Tenth Circuits, have issued decisions with language 
13
arguably suggesting that section 111 of title 18, 
14
United States Code, is a crime of specific intent 
15
rather than a crime of general intent, creating the 
16
appearance of a split among the United States 
17
courts of appeals. 
18
(6) In light of the appearance of a split among 
19
the United States courts of appeals described in 
20
paragraph (5), it has become necessary for Congress 
21
to clarify its original intent that section 111 of title 
22
18, United States Code, is a crime of general intent.
