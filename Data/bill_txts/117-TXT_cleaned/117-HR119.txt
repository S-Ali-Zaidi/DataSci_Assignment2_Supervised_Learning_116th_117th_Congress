RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the United States Postal Service should take all appro-
priate measures to restore service standards in effect 
as of July 1, 2012. 
Whereas, on January 5, 2015, the United States Postal Serv-
ice has implemented lower ‘‘service standards’’ to vir-
tually eliminate overnight delivery of first class mail and 
periodicals, and further delay most other mail; 
Whereas the Postal Regulatory Commission found that it was 
not necessary to degrade postal services to realize sub-
stantial cost savings and that there are other ways to 
save the postal service money without jeopardizing the 
service Americans rely upon;

Whereas delayed mail negatively impacts businesses, hurts 
residents, rural communities, and the economy, and 
drives customers away, resulting in lower revenue and 
worsens the Postal Service’s financial situation; and 
Whereas robust service standards implemented by the United 
States Postal Service are essential to providing prompt 
and timely delivery of all mail, online purchases, local 
newspapers, newsletters, bill payments, letters, invita-
tions, packages, and medicines: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-
1
resentatives that the United States Postal Service should 
2
take all appropriate measures to restore service standards

in effect as of July 1, 2012.
