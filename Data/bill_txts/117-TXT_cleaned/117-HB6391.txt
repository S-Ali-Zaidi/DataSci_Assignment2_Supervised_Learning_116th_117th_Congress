(1) The Government of the People’s Republic of

China maintains, as a national priority, a global pro-

requirements, particularly in fields of high tech-
1
nology. 
2
(2) China is taking steps to establish a com-
3
manding position in the commercial launch and sat-
4
ellite sectors relying in part on aggressive state- 
5
backed financing that market-driven companies can-
6
not match. 
7
(3) China has engaged in an aggressive cam-
8
paign to dominate sensitive markets such as germa-
9
nium wafer production, used for nearly all special-
10
ized satellite solar panels, allowing China ownership 
11
of over 70 percent of global germanium mining, re-
12
fining, and production. 
13
(4) China has begun focusing on the lunar sur-
14
face and cislunar space as priorities in its space pro-
15
gram, which is indistinguishable from its armed 
16
forces.
