CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the significance of equal pay and the disparity 
in wages paid to Latina women in comparison to men. 
Whereas December 8, 2022, is Latina Equal Pay Day to ob-
serve that Latina women must work nearly an additional 
11 months to earn, on average, what White, non-His-
panic men were paid in 2021; 
Whereas Latina women make up the second-largest group of 
women workers in the United States, after White women;

Whereas there are 12,800,000 Hispanic women in the labor 
force, representing slightly more than 17 percent of all 
women in the labor force today; 
Whereas the labor force participation rate of Latina women 
in 2021 was higher than that of their White counter-
parts, which reflects that a growing share of Latina 
women are either working or actively looking for work; 
Whereas section 6(d) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 
1938 (29 U.S.C. 206(d)(1)) prohibits discrimination in 
wages on the basis of sex for equal work; 
Whereas title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 
2000e et seq.) prohibits discrimination in compensation 
because of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex; 
Whereas despite the passage of the Equal Pay Act of 1963 
(29 U.S.C. 206 note) more than five decades ago, which 
establishes that employers shall not discriminate in wages 
on the basis of sex but shall provide equal pay for equal 
work, Census Bureau data show that Latina women 
working full-time and year-round are paid 57 cents for 
every dollar paid to White, non-Hispanic men, while the 
average wage differential for all Latina women with re-
ported earnings working full-time, part-time and part- 
year is 54 cents for every dollar paid to White, non-His-
panic men; 
Whereas a study conducted in 2019 found that on average, 
Latina women lose over $1,100,000 in potential earnings 
over their lifetime to the wage gap; 
Whereas the American Community Survey 2016–2020 re-
ported that median annual pay for Latina women in the 
United States working full-time, year-round was $33,000;

Whereas the American Community Survey 2016–2020 re-
ported that median annual pay for all Latina women with 
reported earnings working full-time, part-time and part- 
year was $25,312, placing a working mother with two 
children near poverty; 
Whereas job loss during the COVID–19 pandemic distorted 
measurements of average wages as women with lower 
earnings in sectors such as leisure, hospitality, and retail 
were more likely to experience job loss and leave the labor 
force; 
Whereas lost wages mean Latina women have less money to 
support themselves and their families, save and invest for 
the future, and spend on goods and services; 
Whereas 51 percent of Latina women are unable to earn sick 
days through their jobs; 
Whereas more than half of Latina women who are low-wage 
earners report that they spent most or all of their savings 
during the COVID–19 pandemic and 32 percent have no 
money left for emergencies, compared to 13 percent of 
White men; 
Whereas the lack of affordable, accessible child care during 
the COVID–19 pandemic led to 14 percent of Latina 
women, and 32 percent of immigrant Latina women, to 
quit their jobs or reduce their number of work hours to 
care for their children; 
Whereas the underpayment of Latina women workers causes 
businesses and the economy to suffer; 
Whereas the lack of access to affordable, quality child care, 
paid family and medical leave, and other family friendly 
workplace policies forces many Latina women to choose 
between their paycheck or job and getting quality care

for themselves or their family members, a dynamic that 
contributes to the wage gap and has been further exacer-
bated by the COVID–19 pandemic, especially as Latina 
women disproportionately work in essential jobs that put 
them at greater risk of exposure to COVID–19; 
Whereas if the wage gap were eliminated, on average, a 
Latina woman working full-time and year-round would 
have enough money to pay for approximately three years 
of child care, to pay off her student debt in one year, or 
to pay off 19 months of the average mortgage payment; 
Whereas 25 to 85 percent of women have been sexually har-
assed at the workplace, and research has found that only 
a small number of those who experience harassment, or 
about 1 in 10, formally report incidents for reasons in-
cluding lack of access to the complaint process and fear 
of retaliation; 
Whereas workplace harassment forces many women to leave 
their occupation or industry—targets of harassment were 
6.5 times as likely as nontargets to change jobs—or pass 
up opportunities for advancement, and this contributes to 
the gender wage gap; 
Whereas there is a high personal cost for women who have 
been sexually harassed, including unemployment, under-
employment, and financial stress resulting from changing 
jobs, which lead to long-term consequences for earnings 
and career attainment; 
Whereas two-thirds of workers paid the minimum wage or 
less in 2020 are women, and there is a disproportionate 
concentration of women of color in low-wage and tipped 
jobs;

Whereas the pay disparity Latina women face is part of a 
wider set of disparities Latina women face in homeowner-
ship, unemployment, poverty, access to child care, and 
the ability to build wealth; 
Whereas true pay equity requires a multifaceted strategy that 
addresses the gender and racial injustices that Latina 
women face daily; and 
Whereas many national organizations have designated De-
cember 8, 2022, as Latina Equal Pay Day to represent 
the additional time that Latina women must work into 
the next calendar year to receive the earnings of White, 
non-Hispanic men in the prior Census year: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate 
1
concurring), That Congress— 
2
(1) recognizes the disparity in wages paid to 
3
Latina women and its impact on women, families, 
4
the economy, and our entire country; and 
5
(2) reaffirms its support for ensuring equal pay 
6
and closing the gender wage gap.
