CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 
Calling an Article V Convention for proposing amendments 
to the Constitution of the United States and stipulating 
the ratification of such amendments by State conven-
tions, a vote of We the People, and for other purposes. 
Whereas Article V of the Constitution of the United States 
states that ‘‘The Congress . . . on the Application of the 
Legislatures of two thirds of the several States, shall call 
a Convention for proposing Amendments’’ to the Con-
stitution; 
Whereas congressional and State records of purported ple-
nary applications for amendments on any subject and ap-
plications for single subject Fiscal Responsibility Amend-
ments compiled by the Article V Library list 42 total ap-
plications over time, 39 active applications in 1979, 40

active applications in 1983, and at least 34 active appli-
cations in many years thereafter; 
Whereas Alexander Hamilton in Federalist 85 stated that 
‘‘The Congress ‘shall call a convention’. Nothing in this 
particular is left to the discretion of that body’’; 
Whereas beginning in 1979, when Congress appears to have 
failed in its constitutional duty to count applications and 
call a ‘‘Convention for proposing Amendments’’, the Na-
tion’s 
debt 
has 
increased 
to 
more 
than 
$30,000,000,000,000 from $830,000,000,000, while the 
value of the dollar has declined by over 70 percent; 
Whereas the Constitution was ratified by Convention dele-
gates ‘‘chosen in each State by the People thereof’’, and 
the 21st Amendment, repealing Prohibition, was ratified 
in 1933 by a vote of the people for Yes-pledged delegates 
in 38 of 39 State Conventions; and 
Whereas the Supreme Court’s unanimous opinion in Chiafalo 
v. Washington stated: ‘‘electors . . . have no ground for 
reversing the vote of millions of its citizens. That direc-
tion accords with the Constitution—as well as with the 
trust of the Nation that here, We the People rule.’’: Now, 
therefore, be it
