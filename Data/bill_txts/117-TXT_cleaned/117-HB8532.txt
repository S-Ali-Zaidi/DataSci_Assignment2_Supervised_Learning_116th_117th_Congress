Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 8532 IH
(1) The Russian Government’s war on Ukraine 
1
has exposed the systemic lack of compliance with 
2
international humanitarian law, jus in bello, on the 
3
part of the Russian military. 
4
(2) Ukrainian civilians have been actively tar-
5
geted by Russian troops, compounding their needless 
6
suffering and forcing non-combatants into a state of 
7
terror. 
8
(3) These barbaric ways of war are inconsistent 
9
with five key principles of the law of armed conflict: 
10
distinction, proportionality, military necessity, hors 
11
de combat and unnecessary suffering. 
12
(4) It is vital that Russian war criminals are 
13
brought to justice. 
14
(5) A key component of any atrocity crimes in-
15
vestigation includes the accurate and reliable testi-
16
mony of witnesses. As war crimes judicial pro-
17
ceedings could take years, and cross many national 
18
jurisdictions, investigators must protect and have 
19
ready access to potential witnesses for a long period 
20
of time. Within the first 100 days of the war, over 
21
11 million people – one quarter of Ukraine’s 44 mil-
22
lion population – had been displaced from their 
23
homes, including five million people who fled the 
24
country.

•HR 8532 IH
(6) There is reasonable concern that suspected 
1
atrocity crimes victims and survivors are less likely 
2
to testify as witnesses in potential legal proceedings, 
3
as they may be in danger of intimidation or not stay 
4
actively engaged due to lack of a support structure 
5
to sustain a lengthy investigation and trial, or as a 
6
result of having fled the country in which the atroc-
7
ities were committed. 
8
(7) Legal experts and civil society groups have 
9
identified an immediate need for supporting and 
10
protecting victims, survivors and witnesses of atroc-
11
ity crimes, no matter where they are located, includ-
12
ing ensuring such efforts are coordinated to mini-
13
mize the risk of retraumatizing survivors. 
14
(8) Without requisite support, victims and sur-
15
vivors are less likely to accept the onerous burden of 
16
testifying against criminals, undermining their abil-
17
ity to attain some justice for their suffering, and re-
18
ducing the ability to hold war criminals accountable 
19
for their actions. 
20
(9) Therefore, it is necessary that the United 
21
States assist relevant authorities and civil society 
22
groups in protecting and supporting this vulnerable 
23
population within Ukraine and across borders.
