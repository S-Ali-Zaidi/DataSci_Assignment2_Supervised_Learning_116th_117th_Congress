SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) At a time of constrained budgets, it is fis-
3
cally prudent to understand the amount and the 
4
scope of the Federal Government’s involvement in 
5
providing disaster-related assistance to communities 
6
in need. 
7
(2) The Federal Government does not provide 
8
a single, publicly available estimate of the amount it 
9
is spending on disaster-related assistance. 
10
(3) Because recovery is a long-term process, 
11
providing disaster-related assistance requires signifi-
12
cant Federal resources to support a multi-agency, 
13
multi-year restoration of infrastructure and com-
14
merce in affected communities. 
15
(4) Understanding the expenditures of indi-
16
vidual Federal agencies for disaster-related assist-
17
ance will help better inform the congressional appro-
18
priations process, as well as presidential budget re-
19
quests. 
20
(5) Knowledge about disaster-related expenses 
21
will illustrate opportunities for reducing these ex-
22
penses through efforts to reduce vulnerabilities to 
23
future natural disasters.
