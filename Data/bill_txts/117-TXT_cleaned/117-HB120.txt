21
carcerated women and mothers, and enhance public

•HR 120 IH
(3) establish female offender risk and needs as-
1
sessment as the cornerstones of a more effective and 
2
efficient Federal prison system; 
3
(4) implement a validated post-sentencing risk 
4
and needs assessment system that relies on dynamic 
5
risk factors to provide Federal prison officials with 
6
a roadmap to address the pre- and post-natal needs 
7
of Federal pregnant offenders, manage limited re-
8
sources, and enhance public safety; 
9
(5) perform regular outcome evaluations of the 
10
effectiveness of programs and interventions for fed-
11
erally incarcerated pregnant women and mothers to 
12
assure that such programs and interventions are evi-
13
dence-based and to suggest changes, deletions, and 
14
expansions based on the results of such evaluations; 
15
and 
16
(6) assist the Department of Justice to address 
17
the underlying cost structure of the Federal prison 
18
system and ensure that the Department can con-
19

21
Department’s critical health, safety and law enforce-
22
