1
the United States, is impeached for endangering the secu-
2
rity of the United States and countering the will of Con-

name of itself and of the people of the United States of 
1
America, against Joseph Robinette Biden, President of the 
2
United States of America, in maintenance and support of 
3
its impeachment against him for endangering the security 
4
of the United States and countering the will of Congress 
5
and other high crimes and misdemeanors. 
6
The Constitution provides that the House of Rep-
7
resentatives ‘‘shall have the sole Power of Impeachment’’ 
8
and that the President ‘‘shall be removed from Office on 
9
Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or 
10
other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.’’. 
11
In his conduct as President of the United States, in 
12
violation of his constitutional oath faithfully to execute the 
13
office of the President of the United States, and, to the 
14
best of his ability, preserve, protect, defend, the Constitu-
15
tion of the United States, and in violation of his constitu-
16
tional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully exe-
17
cuted—Joseph Robinette Biden abused the power of the 
18
Office of the President by endangering the security of the 
19
United States. 
20
He has allowed illegal aliens to enter the United 
21
States in violation of immigration law, admitted aliens 
22
who have tested positive for COVID–19 into the United 
23
States, countered the will of Congress by not completing 
24
the southern border wall, deprived border agents of the

border and its physical infrastructure, empowered foreign

terrorists and their allies by leaving thousands of dollars

ARTICLE I 
7
Among other examples, it has been materially dem-
8
onstrated that: 
9
(1) President Biden’s Department of Homeland 
10
Security has willfully refused to maintain operational 
11
control of the border as required by the Secure 
12
Fence Act of 2006. His actions have directly led to 
13
an increase in illegal aliens and illegal narcotics, in-
14
cluding deadly fentanyl, entering the United States. 
15
(2) President Biden’s administration willfully 
16
violated the Immigration and Nationality Act by re-
17
leasing illegal aliens into the interior of the United 
18
States. The Act clearly requires DHS to detain 
19
aliens seeking admission to the United States while 
20
they are processed. By law, DHS does not have the 
21
option to simply release aliens into the interior of 
22
the United States. 
23
(3) President Biden reinstituted the catch and 
24
release policies of the Obama administration and has

•HRES 597 IH 
released aliens into the interior of the United States 
1
without issuing the aliens notices to appear. 
2
(4) Under President Biden’s administration, 
3
the Department of Homeland Security terminated 
4
the Migrant Protection Protocols, which provided a 
5
pathway to process claims in compliance with the 
6
law, and served as a deterrent to illegal immigration 
7
and aliens making fraudulent asylum claims. 
8
(5) As a result of President Biden’s policies, 
9
CBP encounters have increased each month since he 
10
became President. Since February 2021, more than 
11
1 million aliens have been encountered by CBP per-
12
sonnel at the southwest land border. 
13
(6) In addition to illegal aliens, President 
14
Biden’s policies have led to a significant increase in 
15
illegal drug smuggling across the southern border. 
16
President Biden’s actions have made the border less 
17
secure and encouraged aliens to enter the United States 
18
illegally instead of taking actions to maintain operational 
19
control of the border. His actions have subverted the will 
20
of Congress and the core tenets of the Constitution. 
21
Article II of the U.S. Constitution tasks the executive 
22
branch—which today includes the Department of Home-
23
land Security—with ensuring the laws passed by Congress 
24
and signed into law by the President are faithfully exe-

cuted. Under President Biden’s administration, the De-
1
partment of Homeland Security has willfully violated the 
2
Immigration and Nationality Act. His actions have endan-
3
gered Americans, subverted the will of Congress, and vio-
4
lated the very rule of law. 
5
ARTICLE II 
6
Joseph Biden, in his conduct as President of the 
7
United States, enacted border policies that endangered the 
8
people of the United States by allowing illegal aliens who 
9
had tested positive for COVID–19 to enter the country 
10
and infect American citizens. 
11
On March 20, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control 
12
and Prevention (CDC) issued an order, pursuant to 42 
13
U.S.C. §§ 265 and 268, suspending the right to introduce 
14
certain persons into the United States from countries 
15
where a quarantinable communicable disease exists. This 
16
order has been extended multiple times since it was first 
17
issued, most recently on August 2, 2021. According to the 
18
CDC, this order is necessary ‘‘to protect the public health 
19
from an increase in the serious danger of the introduction 
20
of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID–19) into the POEs, 
21
and the Border Patrol stations between POEs, at or near 
22
the United States borders with Canada and Mexico.’’. 
23
The law requires Border Patrol agents and other 
24
CBP officers to enforce the order. Despite this require-
25

•HRES 597 IH 
ment, President Biden’s administration has refused to 
1
faithfully implement this order as evidenced by the in-
2
creasing number of aliens processed by CBP under Title 
3
8 instead of expelled pursuant Title 42. According to CBP 
4
data from February 2021, approximately 26 percent of 
5
aliens encountered by the Border Patrol were processed 
6
pursuant to Title 8 instead of Title 42, and in June 2021, 
7
nearly 42 percent of aliens encountered by Border Patrol 
8
were processed pursuant to Title 8. 
9
If DHS is unable to expel aliens pursuant to Title 
10
42, it should not release aliens into the interior of the 
11
United States where they can spread COVID–19. How-
12
ever, instead of detaining aliens as required by law, under 
13
President Biden’s leadership DHS has released and trans-
14
ported hundreds of thousands of aliens into the interior 
15
of the United States without properly screening the aliens 
16
for COVID–19 to ensure that the aliens would not spread 
17
COVID–19. These actions have subjected the American 
18
people to unnecessary and avoidable risks. 
19
President Biden clearly violated his duties as Presi-
20
dent in failing to enforce our Nation’s immigration laws. 
21
He has violated his constitutional oath of office by failing 
22
to enforce laws enacted by Congress and by usurping Con-
23
gress’ spending authority. Biden’s dereliction of duty has 
24
endangered America and the very laws that govern her.

ARTICLE III 
1
President Biden has gravely endangered the security 
2
of the United States, the health and safety of the Amer-
3
ican people, and its institutions of government. 
4
President Biden has created a national security crisis 
5
and is endangering the lives of everyday Americans with 
6
his open borders policies. 
7
Moreover, by carelessly withdrawing the American 
8
military from Afghanistan and leaving billions of dollars 
9
of military assets in the hands of terrorists to be used 
10
against us, causing an unknown amount of death and suf-
11
fering, leaving thousands of Americans stranded in Af-
12
ghanistan risking their lives under radical Islamic Taliban 
13
rule, rapidly bringing in Afghan refugees before vetting 
14
them to the interior of the United States, President Biden 
15
has empowered the Taliban, ISIS, Al Qaeda, and the Mus-
16
lim Brotherhood, among others, to threaten America, 
17
American citizens, and her security interests. 
18
Further, given that there are only 19,000 Customs 
19
and Border Patrol (CBP) agents to watch the entire coun-
20
try, the executive repeal of the ‘‘Remain in Mexico’’ policy, 
21
failing to complete the Southern border wall, repair gates

stuck open or shut, and canceling contracts with critical 
23

•HRES 597 IH 
not build and maintain the wall, Biden is breaking his 
1
sworn oath as President of the United States to protect 
2
and defend the United States against all enemies. 
3
In each of these actions, Joseph R. Biden failed to 
4
enact policies and created an environment of lawlessness 
5
to the manifest injury of the people of the United States. 
6
Wherefore President Biden, by such conduct, has 
7
demonstrated that he will remain a threat to national se-
8
curity and the Constitution if allowed to remain in office, 
9
and has acted in a manner grossly incompatible with self- 
10
governance and the rule of law. President Biden thus war-
11
rants impeachment and trial, removal from office, and dis-
12
qualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust, 
13
or profit under the United States.
