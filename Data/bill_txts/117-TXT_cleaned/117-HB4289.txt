A BILL 
To amend title II of the Social Security Act to provide 
for long-term care insurance benefits, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Well-Being Insurance

for Seniors to be at Home Act’’ or the ‘‘WISH Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE. 
6
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) More than half of Americans entering old 
8
age today will have a long-term need for constant at-
9
tendance by another person, averaging $298,000 
10

costs per person for about 2 years of serious self- 
1
care disability (as defined in HIPAA), and more 
2
than half will be out-of-pocket, according to the U.S. 
3
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). 
4
(2) The AARP report that the population age 
5
85 or older is set to double between 2015 and 2032, 
6
and triple by 2050. This aging will outpace the num-
7
ber of working-age family members who can help 
8
seniors financially or with unpaid care. 
9
(3) Research has shown that the typical U.S. 
10
senior could afford only about 12 months of nursing 
11
home care, assisted living care, or extensive home 
12
care using their financial wealth. Some can get by 
13
using unpaid (family) care, but most rely on a com-
14
bination of paid and unpaid care. 
15
(4) More than 1 in 5 middle-income seniors will 
16
end up impoverished, Medicaid eligible, and using 
17
Medicaid to cover their long-term services and sup-
18
ports (LTSS) costs, according to Altarum analysis 
19
of HHS projections. 
20
(5) Millions of older Americans—1 in 5—will 
21
need LTSS for more than 5 years, with a price tag 
22
that would impoverish nearly all American house-
23
holds if they faced that need. HHS projections show 
24
that older adults who need LTSS for more than 5 
25
22:38 Jul 26, 2021
H4289
3 
•HR 4289 IH
years incur nearly half of all LTSS expenses and 60 
1
percent of Medicaid’s LTSS spending. 
2
(6) An older adult with high LTSS needs is 
3
about 50 percent more likely to enter Medicaid when 
4
compared to seniors with similar finances earlier in 
5
life. 
6
(7) Long-term care insurance (LTCI) is rarely 
7
available, and premiums have pushed plan-holders to 
8
drop out. Only 6 percent of seniors had any private 
9
coverage for LTSS expenses in 2018, leaving almost 
10
all middle-class American families to exhaust their 
11
nest-eggs and become impoverished before qualifying 
12
for Medicaid. 
13
(8) The nation urgently needs to create meth-
14
ods for ordinary Americans to be able to take re-
15
sponsibility for planning for the risk of a substantial 
16
period of disability during retirement years. 
17
(9) Those methods must also responsibly sup-
18
port the workforce providing supports and services. 
19
(b) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act is to enable 
20
most Americans to make plans that protect themselves 
21
and their families, to enable disabled older adults to sup-
22
port themselves in their communities during periods of se-
23
rious disability, to support the workforce providing direct

services to elders living with disabilities, and to reduce 
1
what is now necessary reliance on Medicaid.
