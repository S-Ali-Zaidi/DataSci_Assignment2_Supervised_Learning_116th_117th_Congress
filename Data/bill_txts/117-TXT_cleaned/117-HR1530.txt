RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the 50th Anniversary of the National Minority 
Supplier Development Council. 
Whereas the National Minority Supplier Development Council 
(hereinafter referred to as ‘‘NMSDC’’) was founded in 
the year 1972; 
Whereas NMSDC is the longest-operating business growth 
engine for the broadest group of systematically excluded 
communities of color, including Asian-Indian, Asian-Pa-
cific, Black, Hispanic, and Native American communities; 
Whereas NMSDC champions upward mobility for the emerg-
ing majority of Americans, creating an equal shot at par-
ticipating in the American experiment of free-market cap-

italism and entrepreneurship, and correcting the unequal 
access to wealth-building opportunities; 
Whereas, in 1969, President Richard M. Nixon established 
the Office of Minority Business Enterprise, which would 
later become the Minority Business Development Agency, 
recognizing the impact of minority businesses on the Na-
tion’s economy; 
Whereas, in 1971, the White House issued Executive Order 
11625, expanding the scope of the agency to authorize 
grants to public and private organizations; 
Whereas, in 1972, a group of Chicago companies led by Rob-
ert Stuart of the National Can Corporation, founded the 
National Minority Purchasing Council in 1972, later be-
coming NMSDC; 
Whereas, over the last 50 years, NMSDC has connected over 
15,000 minority business enterprises (as defined in sec-
tion 100002(9) of the Minority Business Development 
Act of 2021 (15 U.S.C. 9501(9)); hereinafter referred to 
as ‘‘MBEs’’) to more than 1,500 corporations, resulting 
in nearly $400 billion in economic output annually, gen-
erating $130 billion in tax revenue, and sustaining 1.75 
million jobs and $122 billion in wages; 
Whereas NMSDC is challenging Congress and the country to 
move the needle toward economic parity for all at a time 
when— 
(1) Black businesses received only 1.67 percent, His-
panic businesses received only 1.78 percent, and Asian- 
Pacific businesses received only 1.23 percent of more 
than $559 billion in Federal contracting dollars eligible 
for small businesses in 2020;

(2) White households are eight times wealthier than 
Black households and five times wealthier than Hispanic 
households; 
(3) 40 percent of Black business owners do not 
apply for financing because they expect to be rejected; 
(4) systematically excluded communities of color are 
up to twice as likely to have a mortgage application de-
nied; and 
(5) workers from communities of color are two to 
five times less likely to be promoted to managerial posi-
tions; 
Whereas, as part of NMSDC’s 50th Anniversary, it has set 
a bold goal to reach $1 trillion in MBE annual revenue, 
almost four times the direct annual revenue; 
Whereas, if the United States continues to grow MBEs and 
help them reach their full potential, an estimated $8 tril-
lion can be added to the gross domestic product; 
Whereas the United States can close the wealth gap by lev-
eling the playing field, creating a society where everyone 
has an equal opportunity to succeed, and by taking the 
American dream and turning it into an American reality; 
Whereas growth for MBEs means growth for all Americans; 
Whereas division K of the Infrastructure Investment and 
Jobs Act (Public Law 117–58) (commonly known as the 
Minority Business Development Act of 2021 (15 U.S.C. 
9501 et seq.)) paved the way to permanently authorize 
the Minority Business Development Agency; 
Whereas the largest investment of Federal funding in a gen-
eration is a key opportunity to shrink the wealth gap; 
Whereas historic infrastructure investments provide a once- 
in-a-lifetime opportunity to increase the Government’s

spending with MBEs while building the infrastructure 
that will help the United States thrive in the coming dec-
ades; 
Whereas, whether it is building the transportation infrastruc-
ture of the future, expanding broadband access, or ensur-
ing our water infrastructure is ready for the challenges 
presented by climate change, MBEs can and should play 
a central role; 
Whereas the Federal Government should ensure that the 
Federal procurement process encourages robust MBE 
participation; and 
Whereas, in 2021, President Biden announced the White 
House’s plan to increase racial equity and support under-
served communities by promoting the equitable delivery 
of Government benefits and contract opportunities for 
Federal Government projects: Now, therefore, be it
