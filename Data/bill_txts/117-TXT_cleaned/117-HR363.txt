enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, title VIII of 
which (42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq.) is commonly known as 
the Fair Housing Act; 
Whereas the Chicago Freedom Movement, led by the Rev-
erend Doctor Martin Luther King, Jr., expanded the

Whereas the National Advisory Commission on Civil Dis-
orders, appointed by President Lyndon B. Johnson and

equal’’;

tin Luther King, Jr.;

ment to ‘‘build inclusive and sustainable communities free 
from discrimination’’;

the basis of sex, including gender; 
Whereas September 13, 2021, will mark the 33d anniversary 
of the congressional passage of the Fair Housing Amend-
ments Act of 1988; 
Whereas the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 passed 
by overwhelming margins in Congress, included protec-
tion on the basis of familial status and disability, created 
an important enforcement mechanism, and expanded the 
definition of ‘‘discriminatory housing practices’’ to in-
clude interference and intimidation, requiring HUD to 
issue regulations to implement and interpret the Fair 
Housing Act and report annually to Congress on the na-
ture and extent of housing discrimination; 
Whereas the intent of Congress in passing the Fair Housing 
Act was broad and inclusive, to advance equal oppor-
tunity in housing and achieve racial integration for the 
benefit of all people in the United States;

Act was to prohibit discrimination in all housing and 
housing-related transactions, including policies or prac-
tices that appear superficially neutral, but have a dis-
criminatory effect on protected classes;

has reaffirmed the use of the disparate impact doctrine 
to challenge policies or practices that have a discrimina-
tory effect on protected classes;

•HRES 363 IH 
Whereas fair housing testing has revealed that discrimination

ists and that fair housing protections must be extended 
to the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer 
(LGBTQ+) community; 
Whereas same-sex couples are 73 percent more likely to be 
denied a home mortgage compared to heterosexual cou-
ples, and when same-sex couples are approved, they pay 
an average of $86,000,000 more in combined annual in-
terest and fees; 
Whereas fair housing testing has revealed that discrimination 
exists against people who use public housing assistance, 
including support from the Housing Choice Voucher and 
Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing programs and other 
legal sources of income, and that fair housing protections 
against source-of-income discrimination must be provided 
to all people; 
Whereas there continues to be widespread discrimination in 
the housing industry against Black, Latinx, and Asian- 
American home buyers by real estate agents; 
Whereas owner-occupied homes located in majority-Black

affordable credit compared to similarly situated White 
borrowers;

pay $765,000,000 more in combined mortgage interest 
each year compared to similarly situated White borrowers 
due to discriminatory factors in mortgage lending by the 
government-sponsored housing finance enterprises; 
Whereas research shows that algorithmic bias and discrimina-
tion exist in online housing platforms and lending that 
use artificial intelligence for advertising and decision- 
making purposes, and there is an urgent need to elimi-
nate individual bias that enters the development of artifi-
cial intelligence systems; 
Whereas the majority of Americans support neighborhood in-
tegration and numerous studies have shown the universal 
benefits of residential integration; 
Whereas reports indicate there are more than 4,000,000 vio-
lations of fair housing laws each year against people of 
all protected classes, and fair housing testing continues 
to uncover a high rate of discrimination in the rental, 
sales, mortgage lending, and insurance markets; 
Whereas 68,000,000 adults in the United States believe they 
have experienced unequal treatment in their housing 
search due to their status as a member of a protected 
class under the Fair Housing Act; 
Whereas less than one percent of fair housing violations are 
reported each year; 
Whereas private nonprofit fair housing organizations funded

Whereas the Fair Housing Assistance Program (FHAP) 
funds State as well as local civil and human rights en-
forcement agencies to investigate and process housing

projects, and take part in training and other projects de-
signed to enhance the agency’s administration and en-
forcement of its fair housing law; 
Whereas while our Nation has made great strides in elimi-
nating housing discrimination, families with children, 
women, people with disabilities, people of color, religious 
minorities, immigrants, LGBTQ+ individuals, and low- 
income people receiving public assistance, among others, 
still face discriminatory barriers to housing; 
Whereas fair housing education and enforcement play a piv-
otal role in increasing housing choice and home owner-
ship opportunities for members of protected classes and 
combating predatory lending; 
Whereas amid a global health and economic crisis, housing 
discrimination against health care workers and persons 
who have been infected by COVID–19, or are perceived 
as having been infected, is contributing to increased evic-
tions and hate crimes; 
Whereas systemic health and economic disparities are exacer-
bated by the COVID–19 pandemic, disproportionately in-

tion, notices, and resources during the COVID–19 pan-
demic to prevent predatory and discriminatory housing 
and lending practices;

dren with disabilities, have experienced unlawful denials
