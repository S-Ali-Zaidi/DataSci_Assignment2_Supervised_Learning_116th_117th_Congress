A BILL 
To amend the Equal Credit Opportunity Act to require credi-
tors to consider certain additional credit information 
when making mortgage loans, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Expanding Access to 
4
Credit through Consumer-Permissioned Data Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
The Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Using alternative data in mortgage lending 
8
(either through alternative credit scores or in under-
9

H8485

•HR 8485 IH
writing) has the potential to increase access to credit 
1
for individuals with little or no credit history with 
2
the national credit reporting agencies (NCRAs), ac-
3
cording to a review of alternative data use in mort-
4
gage lending by the Government Accountability Of-
5
fice in December 2021. 
6
(2) Approximately 45 million consumers do not 
7
have any credit history with the NCRAs or did not 
8
have enough credit history to be scored, according to 
9
a 2015 report by the Bureau of Consumer Financial 
10
Protection (CFPB), entitled ‘‘Data Point: Credit 
11
Invisibles’’. The CFPB also reported that this popu-
12
lation disproportionately included low-income con-
13
sumers, younger consumers, and consumers of color. 
14
(3) The use of alternative data to establish a 
15
low- or moderate-income borrower’s credit history 
16
for the purpose of extending mortgage credit can 
17
help lenders meet goals of the Community Reinvest-
18
ment Act. 
19
(4) Mortgage underwriting systems that allow 
20
lenders to use consumer-permissioned alternative 
21
credit information may help expand access to mort-
22
gages for borrowers with lower credit scores and 
23
communities of color. On September 21, 2021, 
24
Fannie Mae updated its automated underwriting

system so that it notifies lenders that a borrower 
1
may benefit from the inclusion of consistent rental 
2
payment information, and with the consumer’s per-
3
mission, the underwriting system will automatically 
4
identify rental payments within bank statement data 
5
and include this in its credit assessment. According 
6
to a fair lending and credit risk analysis by Fannie 
7
Mae and the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the 
8
populations most likely to benefit from this change 
9
are applicants with lower credit scores, who are dis-
10
proportionately consumers of color.
