STRATEGY 
FOR 
COOPERATION 
ON 
INTER-
8
MEDIATE-RANGE MISSILE LAUNCHERS AND

SYSTEMS TO NATO ALLIES. 
10
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
11
(1) All NATO allies agree that the SSC-8/ 
12
9M729 missile system developed and deployed by the 
13
Government of Russia violated the Intermediate- 
14
Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (in this section re-
15
ferred to as the ‘‘INF Treaty’’), while posing a sig-
16
nificant risk to NATO security. 
17
(2) Despite NATO allies’ repeated calls on the 
18
Government of Russia to return to full and verifiable 
19
compliance with the INF Treaty, Russia continued 
20
to develop and deploy INF Treaty-violating systems, 
21
which led to the INF Treaty’s demise on August 2, 
22
2019. 
23
(3) As of the INF Treaty’s demise, Russia had 
24
produced and deployed multiple battalions of INF

•HR 6367 IH
Treaty-violating missiles, capable of reaching key 
1
European capitals and targets. 
2
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—A mutual deployment 
3
moratorium in the European theater with the Russian 
4
Federation is not in the interest of the United States. 
5
Even if a European-Theater intermediate-range ground- 
6
launched missile deployment moratorium were verifiable, 
7
any such moratorium would significantly advantage Rus-
8
sia and disadvantage NATO. This is due to the Russian 
9
Federation’s continual threats of aggression against sov-
10
ereign European nations, the relative ease by which Russia 
11
could deploy such systems to the theater, and the logistical 
12
impediments with which the United States and NATO 
13
would have to contend should it be determined a commen-
14
surate response was warranted. 
15
(c) STRATEGY.—Not later than 90 days after the 
16
date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense 
17
and the Secretary of State shall jointly develop a strategy 
18
to cooperate with willing NATO member countries in the
