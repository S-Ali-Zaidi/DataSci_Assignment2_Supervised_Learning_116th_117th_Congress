RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the seriousness of polycystic ovary syndrome 
(PCOS) and expressing support for the designation of 
the month of September 2022 as ‘‘PCOS Awareness 
Month’’. 
Whereas polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common 
health problem among women and girls involving a hor-
monal imbalance; 
Whereas there is no universal definition of PCOS, but re-
searchers estimate that 5 to 10 million women in the 
United States are affected by the condition, and preva-
lence estimates range from 8 to 13 percent of women 
globally; 
Whereas the most recent published data, a 2004 study, esti-
mates the annual burden of PCOS in the United States 
is $4.36 billion, and this figure pertains to women’s re-
productive years alone and does not consider the cost of 
other comorbidities, including obstetrical complications or 
the cost of metabolic morbidities in post-menopause or 
adolescence; 
Whereas PCOS can affect girls from the onset of puberty and 
throughout the remainder of their lives; 
Whereas the symptoms of PCOS include infertility, irregular 
or absent menstrual periods, acne, weight gain, thinning 
of scalp hair, excessive facial and body hair growth, nu-
merous small ovarian cysts, pelvic pain, and mental 
health problems; 
Whereas women with PCOS have higher rates of psychosocial 
disorders, including depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, 
and eating disorders, and are at greater risk for suicide;

Whereas adolescents with PCOS often are not diagnosed, 
many of whom have metabolic dysfunction and insulin re-
sistance, which can lead to type 2 diabetes, cardio-
vascular disease, obstructive sleep apnea, nonalcoholic 
fatty liver disease, and endometrial cancer at a young 
adult age; 
Whereas PCOS is the most common cause of female infer-
tility; 
Whereas PCOS in pregnancy is associated with increased risk 
of gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, pregnancy-induced 
hypertension, preterm delivery, cesarean delivery, mis-
carriage, and fetal and infant death; 
Whereas women with PCOS are at increased risk of devel-
oping high blood pressure, high cholesterol, stroke, and 
heart disease (the leading cause of death among women); 
Whereas women with PCOS have a more than 50 percent 
chance of developing type 2 diabetes or prediabetes be-
fore the age of 40; 
Whereas women with PCOS may be at a higher risk for 
breast cancer and ovarian cancer, and have a 3 times 
higher risk for developing endometrial cancer compared 
to women who do not have PCOS; 
Whereas research has found genetic evidence of a causal link 
to depression in PCOS; 
Whereas research has found genetic correlations with obesity, 
fasting insulin, type 2 diabetes, lipid levels, and coronary 
artery disease, indicating shared genetic architecture be-
tween metabolic traits and PCOS; 
Whereas adolescents with PCOS are at markedly increased 
risk for type 2 diabetes, fatty liver disease, and heart dis-
ease;

Whereas PCOS negatively alters metabolic function inde-
pendent of, but exacerbated by, increased BMI; 
Whereas an estimated 50 percent of women with PCOS are 
undiagnosed, and many remain undiagnosed until they 
experience fertility difficulties or develop type 2 diabetes 
or other cardiometabolic disorders; 
Whereas the cause of PCOS is unknown, but researchers 
have found strong links to a genetic predisposition, and 
significant insulin resistance, which affects up to 70 per-
cent of women with PCOS; and 
Whereas there is no known cure for PCOS: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) 
recognizes 
polycystic 
ovary 
syndrome 
2
(PCOS) as a serious disorder that impacts many as-
3
pects of health, including cardiometabolic, reproduc-
4
tive, and mental health as well as quality of life; 
5
(2) supports the goals and ideals of PCOS 
6
Awareness Month, which are to— 
7
(A) increase awareness of, and education 
8
about, 
PCOS 
and 
its 
connection 
to 
9
comorbidities 
such 
as 
type 
2 
diabetes, 
10
endometrial cancer, cardiovascular disease, non-
11
alcoholic fatty liver disease, and mental health 
12
disorders among the general public, women, 
13
girls, and health care professionals;

(B) improve diagnosis and treatment of 
1
the disorder; 
2
(C) disseminate information on PCOS di-
3
agnosis, treatment, and management including 
4
prevention of comorbidities such as type 2 dia-
5
betes, endometrial cancer, cardiovascular dis-

disorders; and 
8
(D) improve quality of life and outcomes 
9
for women and girls with PCOS; 
10
(3) recognizes the need for further research, 
11
improved treatment and care options, and a cure for 
12
PCOS; 
13
(4) acknowledges the struggles affecting all 
14
women and girls afflicted with PCOS residing within 
15
the United States; 
16
(5) urges medical researchers and health care 
17
professionals to advance their understanding of 
18
PCOS in order to research, diagnose, and provide 
19
assistance to women and girls with PCOS; and 
20
(6) encourages States, territories, and localities 
21
to support the goals and ideals of PCOS Awareness 
22
