SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) One in five adults in America experience 
3
some form of mental illness, and nearly one in twen-
4
ty-five adults live with serious mental illness. 
5
(2) Access to mental health services is a par-
6
ticularly pervasive problem; 28 million residents of 
7
the United States are uninsured and have no access 
8
to mental health services. Studies show that nearly 
9
60 percent of adults and 50 percent of children with 
10
a mental illness did not receive mental health serv-
11
ices in the previous calendar year. 
12
(3) The lack of access to mental health services 
13
has, in part, contributed to an increase in the sui-
14
cide rate in the United States, which is now the 
15
tenth leading cause of death in this country. 
16
(4) In 2017, 47,173 Americans died by suicide. 
17
(5) In 2017, there were an estimated 1,400,000 
18
suicide attempts in the United States. 
19
(6) Suicide by a loved one often results in ‘‘sui-
20
cide contagion’’; for surviving family and friends the 
21
risk of attempting suicide increases by 65 percent. 
22
(7) Family and friends who lost a loved one to 
23
suicide are 80 percent more likely to drop out of 
24
school or stop working.

(8) Access to mental health services is impor-
1
tant to mitigate suicide, suicide contagion, and be-
2
reavement. Access to care also reduces the financial 
3
burden for individuals in need of mental health serv-
4
ices. 
5
(9) The Patient Protection and Affordable Care 
6
Act has increased access to mental health services, 
7
but there is still a large population that is uninsured 
8
or has insufficient coverage to seek mental health 
9
services. 
10
(10) Family and friends who have lost a loved 
11
one to suicide should not face hurdles when attempt-
12
ing to access mental health services. As such, a sui-
13
cide or suicide attempt should constitute a ‘‘quali-
14
fying life event’’ for any individual who is eligible to 
15
enroll, but is not enrolled, in a health benefit plan 
16
under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care 
17
Act.
