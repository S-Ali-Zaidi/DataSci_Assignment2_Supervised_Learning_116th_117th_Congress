RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives regard-
ing United States policy recognizing the Assyrian Geno-
cide. 
Whereas the Ottoman Empire committed the crime of geno-
cide against the Assyrian people, killing at least 300,000 
innocent Assyrians by way of mass executions, death 
marches, torture, and starvation during the First World 
War; 
Whereas, in August 1933, approximately 3,000 Assyrians 
were brutally murdered in Semele in the Duhok and 
Mosul districts of modern-day Iraq by the nascent Iraqi 
army and irregular Kurdish and Arab forces; 
Whereas August 7 is globally observed by the Assyrian com-
munity as Assyrian Memorial Day in remembrance of all

massacres and genocides committed against the Assyrian 
people and of the persecution this community has faced 
as a result of their distinct ethnic and religious identity; 
Whereas the International Association of Genocide Scholars 
has found that the genocide against the Assyrian popu-
lation was part of a larger campaign against Christian 
minorities, including Armenians and Pontian and 
Anatolian Greeks; 
Whereas Raphael Lemkin, who coined the term ‘‘genocide’’ in 
1944, drew on the history of the Assyrian Genocide in his 
seminal work that guided the United Nations Convention 
on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Geno-
cide; 
Whereas the Elie Wiesel Genocide and Atrocities Prevention 
Act of 2018 (Public Law 115–441) establishes that 
atrocities prevention represents a United States national 
interest, and affirms that it is the policy of the United 
States to pursue a United States Governmentwide strat-
egy to identify, prevent, and respond to the risk of atroc-
ities by ‘‘strengthening diplomatic response and the effec-
tive use of foreign assistance to support appropriate tran-
sitional justice measures, including criminal account-
ability, for past atrocities’’; 
Whereas the resilience and endurance of the Assyrian people 
is commendable and praiseworthy, despite being victims 
of an ethnocide that is being continued by the Islamic 
State; 
Whereas the Assyrian community across the world continues 
to feel the effects of the Assyrian Genocide, including 
families that have never been reunited;

critical to efforts of preventing both future genocides and 
further harm to the group upon which the genocide was
