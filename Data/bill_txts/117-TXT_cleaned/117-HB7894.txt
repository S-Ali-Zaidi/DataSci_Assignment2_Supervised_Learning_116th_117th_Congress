A BILL 
To require group health plans and group or individual health 
insurance coverage to provide coverage for over-the- 
counter contraceptives. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Affordability is Access 
4
Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. PURPOSE. 
6
The purpose of this Act is to ensure timely access 
7
to affordable birth control by requiring coverage without 
8
cost-sharing for oral birth control for routine, daily use 
9
that is approved by, or otherwise legally marketed under 
10
regulation by, the Food and Drug Administration for use 
11
without a prescription. 
12
SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
13
The House of Representatives finds the following: 
14
(1) Birth control is critical health care that al-
15
most all women will use at some point in their life-
16
times. 
17
(2) Access to the full range of reproductive 
18
health care, including birth control coverage as guar-
19
anteed under Federal law, provides people with the

opportunity to lead healthy lives and get the care 
1
they need to reach their goals. 
2
(3) Family planning has well documented 
3
health benefits for women, newborns, families, and 
4
communities and can lower the risk of harm to ma-
5
ternal and infant health. 
6
(4) An estimated 72,000,000 women of repro-
7
ductive age (ages 15 through 44) live in the United 
8
States, of which nearly 70 percent are at risk of 
9
having an unintended pregnancy. Sixty-five percent 
10
of women of reproductive age are using a contracep-
11
tive method and 12 percent of women at risk for un-
12
intended pregnancy are not using contraception. The 
13
rates of non-use of contraception are highest among 
14
those between 15 and 19 years old. 
15
(5) The birth control benefit enacted under the 
16
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public 
17
Law 111–148) has been a crucial step forward in 
18
advancing access to birth control and has helped en-
19
sure 62,100,000 women have the power to decide for 
20
themselves if and when to start a family. 
21
(6) Despite legal requirements for birth control 
22
coverage and access to services, gaps remain for mil-
23
lions of people. A national survey found that 1 in 3 
24
women have struggled to afford birth control at 
25

some point in their lives, and as a result, have used 
1
birth control inconsistently. Access to birth control is 
2
particularly difficult for people who live in contra-
3
ceptive deserts and lack reasonable access to a 
4
health center that offers the full range of contracep-
5
tive methods. 
6
(7) Health disparities persist among people 
7
with low-incomes, people of color, LGBTQ people, 
8
immigrants and people who lack access to health 
9
coverage and health care providers. 
10
(8) There are numerous social and economic 
11
barriers that make it harder to access birth control, 
12
including rising income and wealth inequality, gaps 
13
in insurance coverage and challenges accessing 
14
health providers. 
15
(9) Leading health experts support over-the- 
16
counter birth control pills. 
17
SEC. 4. SENSE OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. 
18
It is the sense of the House of Representatives that— 
19
(1) in order to increase access to oral birth con-
20
trol, such birth control must be both easier to obtain 
21
and affordable and, to make such birth control ei-
22
ther easier to obtain or more affordable, but not 
23
both, is to leave unacceptable barriers in place; 
24

•HR 7894 IH
(2) it is imperative that the entities that re-
1
search and develop oral birth control and whose 
2
medical and scientific experts have developed clinical 
3
and other evidence that oral birth control for rou-
4
tine, daily use is safe and effective when sold with-
5
out a prescription, apply to the Food and Drug Ad-
6
ministration for review and approval for sale of such 
7
birth control without a prescription; 
8
(3) upon the receipt of such an application, the 
9
Food and Drug Administration should determine 
10
whether the oral birth control meets the rigorous 
11
safety, efficacy, and quality standards for over-the- 
12
counter use under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cos-
13
metic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.), and if the prod-
14
uct meets those standards, the Food and Drug Ad-
15
ministration should approve the application without 
16
delay; and 
17
(4) if and when the Food and Drug Adminis-
18
tration approves an oral birth control that is avail-
19
able over-the-counter, such birth control should be 
20
covered by health insurance, without a prescription 
21
and without cost-sharing. 
22
SEC. 5. CLARIFYING COVERAGE REQUIREMENTS. 
23
The Secretaries of Health and Human Services, 
24
Labor, and the Treasury shall clarify that coverage of con-

traceptives pursuant to section 2713(a)(4) of the Public 
1
Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300gg–13(a)(4)) includes 
2
coverage of over-the-counter contraceptive methods ap-
3
proved by the Food and Drug Administration, even if the 
4
enrollee does not have a prescription for the contraceptive.
