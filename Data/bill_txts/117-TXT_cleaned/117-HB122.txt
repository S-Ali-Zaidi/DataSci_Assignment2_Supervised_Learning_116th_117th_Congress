•HR 122 IH
(1) 
In 
2015, 
there 
were 
approximately 
1
43,100,000 Americans living in poverty who were 
2
separated from the opportunities of the Nation by 
3
their income, their housing, and their access to edu-
4
cation, jobs, and health care. 
5
(2) A full-time worker earning the Federal min-
6
imum wage earns an income below the Federal pov-
7
erty threshold for a family of 4, consisting of 2 
8
adults and 2 children. 
9
(3) The average fair market rent for a 1-bed-
10
room apartment is more than 65 percent of the 
11
monthly income of a full-time worker earning the 
12
minimum wage. In comparison, the generally accept-
13
ed definition of affordability is for a household to 
14
pay not more than 30 percent of its income on hous-
15
ing. 
16
(4) Two full-time workers earning the Federal 
17
minimum wage earn an income below the national 
18
housing wage for a 1-bedroom apartment, the 
19
amount a person needs to earn to afford a 1-bed-
20
room apartment at average rent. 
21
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
22
gress that— 
23
(1) the Federal minimum wage should, as a 
24
minimum, be adjusted every 4 years so that a person 
25

•HR 122 IH
working for such a wage may earn an annual income 
1
that is not less than 25.5 percent higher than the 
2
Federal poverty threshold for a family of 4, as deter-
3
mined by the Bureau of the Census; 
4
(2) the minimum wage should be set at a level 
5
high enough to allow 2 full-time minimum wage 
6
workers to earn an income above the national hous-
7
ing wage; and 
8
(3) Congress, any of the several States, the Dis-
9
trict of Columbia, any territory or possession of the 
10
United States, any Indian tribe, or any local or mu-
11
nicipal government of a State may establish a higher 
12
minimum wage requirement than that established in 
13
this Act.

8
shall determine the minimum wage rate applicable under 
9
subsection (a)(1) based on the formula described in para-
10
graph (3). The Secretary shall publish such wage rate in 
11
the Federal Register not later than October 1 of each year. 
12
‘‘(2) If the minimum wage rate determined by the 
13
Secretary under paragraph (1) would result in a lower 
14
minimum wage rate than the minimum wage rate in effect 
15
at the time of such determination, the Secretary may not 
16
adjust the minimum wage rate so in effect. 
17
‘‘(3) The minimum wage rate determined by the Sec-
18
retary under paragraph (1) shall be the minimum hourly 
19
wage sufficient for a person working for such wage for 
20
40 hours per week, 52 weeks per year, to earn an annual 
21
income in an amount that is 25.5 percent higher than the 
22
Federal poverty threshold for a family of 4, with two chil-
23
