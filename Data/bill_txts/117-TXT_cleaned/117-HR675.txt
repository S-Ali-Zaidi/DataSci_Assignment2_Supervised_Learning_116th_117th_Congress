Whereas there is no date dedicated to families affected by the 
loss of a loved one who died in service to the United 
States; 
Whereas a gold star symbolizes a family member who died in 
the line of duty while serving in the Armed Forces of the 
United States; 
Whereas the members and veterans of the Armed Forces of 
the United States, through their service, bear the burden 
of protecting the freedom of the people of the United 
States; 
Whereas the selfless example of the service of the members 
and veterans of the Armed Forces of the United States, 
as well as the sacrifices made by the families of those in-
dividuals, inspires all individuals in the United States to 
sacrifice and work diligently for the good of the United 
States; and 
Whereas the sacrifices of the families of the fallen members 
of the Armed Forces and the families of veterans of the 
Armed Forces of the United States should never be for-
gotten: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
