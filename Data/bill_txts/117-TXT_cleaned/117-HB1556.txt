A BILL 
To require State and local governments to establish reopen-
ing plans as a condition of receiving funding under title 
VI of the Social Security Act, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘End Lockdowns Now

Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 1556 IH
(1) During the course of the COVID-19 pan-
1
demic, many State and localities have acted in a ca-
2
pricious and haphazard manner to restrict economic 
3
activity and stifle civil liberties. 
4
(2) The specific restrictions are commonly re-
5
ferred to as ‘‘lockdown,’’ ‘‘stay-at-home,’’ or ‘‘shel-
6
ter-in-place’’ orders. These restrictions have forced 
7
‘‘non-essential’’ businesses to close their doors and 
8
prohibited their workers from earning a living. 
9
(3) Many of these State and local authorities 
10
have not followed a careful risk-based model in-
11
formed by science to guide decision making and 
12
these officials have claimed the authority to act in 
13
a manner unlimited in scope and indefinite in dura-
14
tion. 
15
(4) The effect of these lockdowns has been the 
16
collapse of millions of business and resulted in the 
17
highest jobless rate in decades. 
18
(5) While the direct health effects of the pan-
19
demic have been devastating to many Americans, 
20
these authorities have often ignored the secondary 
21
effects of the crisis, including the death, illness, and 
22
suffering caused by the despair and hardship result-
23
ing from their lockdowns.

•HR 1556 IH
(6) One of the most troublesome examples of 
1
severe overreach by State officials occurred when 
2
New York imposed restrictions on congregation size 
3
limits, discriminating on the basis of religion in vio-
4
lation of the First Amendment. The U.S. Supreme 
5
Court determined the State of New York’s rules es-
6
sentially singled out houses of worship for unfair 
7
and unconstitutional restrictions (Roman Catholic 
8
Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo). 
9
(7) State governors do have the authority to 
10
implement targeted restrictions in the case of a pub-
11
lic health emergency, yet many of the unrestrained 
12
orders issued during the pandemic have effectively 
13
violated many civil liberties and personal freedoms. 
14
(8) In addition, many of the public orders are 
15
so economically burdensome that they essentially 
16
function as a taking of property, which requires suf-
17
ficient compensation under the takings clause of the 
18
Fifth Amendment to the Constitution. 
19
(9) Congress urges State and local leaders to 
20
carefully consider the broad consequences of their 
21
restrictions and to expeditiously take steps to allow 
22
businesses, schools, and other elements of society to 
23
reopen.

•HR 1556 IH
(10) Congress hereby acts to condition relief 
1
funds based on the submission of a plan by State 
2
and localities detailing any current restrictions and 
3
their plans to lift these restrictions. 
4
(11) Congress further acts to prevent any un-
5
necessary overreach by the Executive Branch by 
6
firmly outlawing restrictions that have the effect of 
7
halting interstate travel or imposing a nationwide 
8
quarantine or lockdown.
