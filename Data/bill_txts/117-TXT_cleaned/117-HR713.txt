RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the Nation should honor and recognize military families 
who have been disproportionately affected by the 
COVID–19 crisis. 
Whereas families all over the world are making sacrifices re-
sulting from the spread of COVID–19, but military fami-
lies in particular are living in tremendous uncertainty; 
Whereas the families of members of the Armed Forces de-
ployed around the world and working on the front lines 
of the virus face enormous challenges that are being ex-
acerbated by the global pandemic; 
Whereas members of the Armed Forces who become infected 
may result in military families having to quarantine over-
seas;

Whereas delayed and canceled permanent change of station 
moves, restrictions on travel, and stay-at-home orders are 
placing an exceptional amount of stress on military fami-
lies as they face challenges including overextended leases, 
threatening loss of housing, and unexpected out-of-pocket 
expenses; 
Whereas spouses of members of the Armed Forces are facing 
job loss or may be unable to work because of the 
COVID–19 crisis, putting additional strain on family 
budgets; 
Whereas pandemic-related school closures can lead to food in-
security for military families; 
Whereas the closure of schools, the shift to distance learning, 
and limited access to care for younger children, including 
the closure of child development centers during the pan-
demic, place a major burden on families, particularly 
those where a parent is deployed; 
Whereas not all military families can afford the essential soft-
ware, broadband access, and equipment required for on-
line school; 
Whereas military personnel and their dependents dealing with 
mental and physical health issues have difficulty main-
taining continuity of care throughout the pandemic; 
Whereas military dependents with special needs rely heavily 
on assistance from the Exceptional Family Member Pro-
gram and other initiatives that may not be able to pro-
vide hands-on assistance due to restrictions to slow the 
spread of the virus; 
Whereas the COVID–19 crisis may result in fluctuations in 
deployment or reintegration schedules, adding further 
strain to an unpredictable time for military families; and

•HRES 713 IH 
Whereas communities and military leaders are working hard 
to support the families of members of the Armed Forces, 
including members of the reserve components, throughout 
this pandemic, the Nation owes a great debt of gratitude 
for their exceptional sacrifices: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-

resentatives to honor the military families who have been

disproportionately affected by the COVID–19 crisis.
