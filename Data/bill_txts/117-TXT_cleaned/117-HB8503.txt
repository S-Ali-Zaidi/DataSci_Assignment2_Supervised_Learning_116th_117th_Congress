A BILL 
To require the development of a strategy to promote the 
use of secure telecommunications infrastructure world-
wide, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Securing Global Tele-
4
communications Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
6
It is the sense of Congress as follows: 
7
(1) The United States Government should pro-
8
mote and take steps to ensure American leadership 
9
in strategic technology industries, including tele-

communications infrastructure and other informa-
1
tion and communications technologies. 
2
(2) The expansive presence of companies linked 
3
to the Chinese Communist Party, such as Huawei, 
4
in global mobile networks and the national security 
5
implications thereof, such as the ability of the Peo-
6
ple’s Republic of China to exfiltrate the information 
7
flowing through those networks and shut off coun-
8
tries’ internet access, demonstrates the importance 
9
of the United States remaining at the technological 
10
frontier and the dire consequences of falling behind. 
11
(3) The significant cost of countering Huawei’s 
12
market leadership in telecommunications infrastruc-
13
ture around the world underscores the urgency of 
14
supporting the competitiveness of United States 
15
companies in next-generation information and com-
16
munication technology. 
17
(4) To remain a leader at the International 
18
Telecommunication Union (ITU) and preserve the 
19
ITU’s technical integrity, the United States must 
20
work with emerging economies and developing na-
21
tions to bolster global telecommunications security 
22
and protect American national security interests. 
23
(5) Multilateral cooperation with like-minded 
24
partners and allies is critical to carry out the signifi-
