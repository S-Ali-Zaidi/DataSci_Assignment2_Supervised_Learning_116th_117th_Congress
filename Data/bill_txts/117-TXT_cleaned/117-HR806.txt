RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
any attempt by the President of the Russian Federation 
Vladimir Putin to remain in office beyond May 7, 2024, 
shall warrant nonrecognition on the part of the United 
States. 
Whereas the Russian Federation, as a member of the United 
Nations, the Organization for Security and Co-operation 
in Europe, and the Council of Europe, is bound by inter-
national commitments with regard to human rights and 
the rule of law; 
Whereas Article 81(3) of the Constitution of the Russian 
Federation, as enacted on December 25, 1993, holds that 
‘‘one and the same person cannot occupy the office of

•HRES 806 IH 
President of the Russian Federation for more than two 
consecutive terms’’; 
Whereas Vladimir Putin has been President of the Russian 
Federation for two consecutive terms, the first term last-
ing from May 7, 2000, to May 7, 2008, and the second, 
current, and final term beginning May 7, 2012, and ex-
piring on May 7, 2024; 
Whereas, on July 3, 2020, following votes in both chambers 
of the Federal Assembly and in regional legislatures and 
a nationwide popular vote, President Vladimir Putin 
signed Presidential Decree No. 445 enacting 206 amend-
ments to the Constitution of the Russian Federation, in-
cluding an amendment waiving the term limit for him 
personally, allowing him to seek 2 more 6-year Presi-
dential terms after May 7, 2024; 
Whereas the enactment of constitutional amendments had 
been conditioned on approval of such amendments in a 
nationwide vote, referred to by President Vladimir Putin 
as a ‘‘plebiscite’’, that was held between June 25 and 
July 1, 2020, under the unprecedented conditions of the 
COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas the 2020 Russian constitutional plebiscite was 
marked by widespread reports of organized voter coer-
cion, multiple voting, ballot-stuffing, and violation of the 
secrecy of the ballot, and by one-sided media coverage in 
favor of the amendments, while opponents of the amend-
ments were not given airtime in the media and had their 
campaign rallies prohibited and their websites blocked; 
Whereas voting was held over 7 days and was conducted not 
only in regular polling places but also in makeshift loca-
tions, including park benches, car trunks, and shopping

carts, with ballots stored overnight by the electoral com-
missions with no independent oversight; 
Whereas in violation of the laws of the Russian Federation 
and the commitments of the Russian Federation under 
the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Eu-
rope and the Council of Europe, Russian authorities did 
not invite international observers to monitor the vote and 
limited domestic observers to those appointed by state- 
controlled Public Chambers; 
Whereas according to opinion polls conducted in the runup to 
the plebiscite by the Levada Center, 48 percent of Rus-
sian voters supported waiving Vladimir Putin’s term limit 
while 47 percent were in opposition; 
Whereas according to official figures released by the Central 
Electoral Commission of the Russian Federation, amend-
ments to the Constitution of the Russian Federation were 
supported by 78 percent of those who participated in the 
plebiscite; 
Whereas the Central Electoral Commission of the Russian 
Federation began announcing the results of the plebiscite 
before voting had concluded; 
Whereas according to the Russian nongovernmental organiza-
tion Golos and independent electoral analysts, approxi-
mately 27,000,000 votes, accounting for 37 percent of 
the official total, were fraudulent, making the plebiscite 
the most manipulated vote in the modern history of the 
Russian Federation; 
Whereas in a statement following the plebiscite, the leaders 
of the United States delegation to the Parliamentary As-
sembly of the Organization for Security and Co-operation 
in Europe, Senator Roger Wicker and the late Represent-

ative Alcee Hastings, said that ‘‘the outcome of this vote 
was decided long before the ballots were tallied’’ and that 
‘‘State-sponsored fraud, coercion, and obfuscation make 
it impossible to know the true will of the Russian peo-
ple’’; 
Whereas Senator James Risch, then-Chairman of the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations of the Senate, has stated 
that the ‘‘sham vote, masquerading as a referendum, has 
swept away all remnants of Putin’s legitimacy’’; 
Whereas the Department of State has held that ‘‘[a]round 
the world, as a matter of principle, the United States op-
poses constitutional amendments that favor incumbents 
or extend their terms in office, particularly in contexts 
where necessary conditions for free and fair democratic 
processes are lacking’’; 
Whereas the United States and the Russian Federation are 
participating states of the Organization for Security and 
Co-operation in Europe; and 
Whereas the Document of the Moscow Meeting of the Con-
ference on the Human Dimension of the Conference on 
Security and Co-operation in Europe holds that ‘‘issues 
relating to human rights, fundamental freedoms, democ-
racy and the rule of law . . . are matters of direct and 
legitimate concern to all participating States and do not 
belong exclusively to the internal affairs of the State con-
cerned’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-

resentatives that—

(1) the 2020 amendments to the Constitution 
3
of the Russian Federation were enacted in violation

of the laws and international commitments of the
