(2) Research by top national experts show 
1
that— 
2
(A) adoption of handgun purchaser licens-
3
ing laws are associated with significant reduc-
4
tions in firearm-related homicides; and 
5
(B) repeal of handgun purchaser licensing 
6
laws are associated with significant increases in 
7
firearm-related homicides. 
8
(3) Research on the effects of the adoption of 
9
a handgun purchaser licensing law in Connecticut in 
10
1995 showed— 
11
(A) a 27.8-percent reduction in the rate of 
12
firearm homicide; and 
13
(B) a 32.8-percent reduction in firearm 
14
suicide rates. 
15
(4) Published research has shown that the re-
16
peal of a handgun purchaser licensing law in Mis-
17
souri in 2007 was associated with— 
18
(A) a 47.3-percent increase in the rate of 
19
firearm homicide; and 
20
(B) a 23.5-percent increase in firearm sui-
21
cide rates. 
22
(5) In States that have had effective handgun 
23
purchaser licensing laws for decades, such as Con-
24
necticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York,

•HR 2707 IH
the vast majority of firearms traced to crimes origi-
1
nated in States that do not have handgun purchaser 
2
licensing laws, which supports the need for handgun 
3
purchaser licensing laws in every State. 
4
(6) Research has shown that States with hand-
5
gun purchaser licensing laws export far fewer fire-
6
arms for criminal use in other States than States 
7
that lack handgun purchaser licensing laws.
