(2) Eighty-one percent of women and 43 per-
1
cent of men have experienced some form of sexual 
2
harassment and/or assault throughout their lifetime.

(3) One in 3 women has faced sexual harass-
4
ment in the workplace during her career, and an es-
5
timated 87 to 94 percent of those who experience 
6
sexual harassment never file a formal complaint. 
7
(4) Sexual harassment in the workplace forces 
8
many women to leave their occupation or industry, 
9
or pass up opportunities for advancement. 
10
(5) In order to combat sexual harassment and 
11
assault, it is essential that victims and survivors 
12
have the freedom to report and publicly disclose 
13
their abuse. 
14
(6) Nondisclosure and nondisparagement provi-
15
sions in agreements between employers and current, 
16
former, and prospective employees, and independent 
17
contractors, and between providers of goods and 
18
services and consumers, can perpetuate illegal con-
19
duct by silencing those who are survivors of illegal 
20
sexual harassment and assault or illegal retaliation, 
21
or have knowledge of such conduct, while shielding 
22
perpetrators and enabling them to continue their 
23
abuse.

(7) Prohibiting predispute nondisclosure and 
1
nondisparagement clauses will empower survivors to 
2
come forward, hold perpetrators accountable for

abuse, improve transparency around illegal conduct, 
4
enable the pursuit of justice, and make workplaces

safer and more productive for everyone.
