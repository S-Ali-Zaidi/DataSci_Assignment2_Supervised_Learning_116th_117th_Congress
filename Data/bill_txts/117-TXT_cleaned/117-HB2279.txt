SEC. 101. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress, recognizing the profound historical role 
5
that all aspects of manufacturing, including research and 
6
development, engineering, skilled trades, and production, 
7
has played in the economy and society of the United 
8
States, and in the economic and innovative standing of 
9
the United States in the global community, and the inter-
10
relations of robust manufacturing on economic, environ-
11
mental, national security, social, political, and institutional 
12
factors, finds that— 
13
(1) the general welfare, security, and economic 
14
health and stability of the United States require a 
15
long-term, substantial, coordinated, and multidisci-
16
plinary strategy and implementation of cohesive ob-
17
jectives to remain at the forefront of industrial inno-
18
vation;

(2) the large and complex innovative and tech-
1
nological capabilities of global supply chains and 
2
manufacturing economies, which influence the course 
3
of national and international manufacturing and in-
4
novative relevance, require appropriate attention, in-
5
cluding long-range inclusive planning and more im-
6
mediate program development, to encourage and 
7
support private manufacturing growth in the United 
8
States and participation in the public decision-mak-
9
ing process; 
10
(3) the innovative and manufacturing capabili-
11
ties of business in the United States, when properly 
12
fostered, applied, and supported, can effectively as-
13
sist in improving the quality of life of people in the 
14
United States, in anticipating and addressing emerg-
15
ing international, national, and local problems, and 
16
strengthening the international economic engage-
17
ment and pioneering leadership of the United States; 
18
(4) just as Federal funding for science and 
19
technology represents an investment in the future, 
20
strategically addressing gaps in the innovation pipe-
21
line of the United States would— 
22
(A) contribute to converting research and

2
(B) strengthen the economic posture of the

United States; and 
4
(5) the capabilities of the United States at both 
5
the Federal and State levels need enhanced strategic

planning and influence over policy formulation for 
7
industrial innovation and technology development, as

well as a means to ensure an adequate workforce.

8
employees, and in traditionally underserved commu-
9
nities.

(7) Contributing to national health and security 
11
and emergency readiness and resilience, including 
12
addressing environmental concerns.

(b) NATIONAL POLICY.—In view of the findings 
3
under section 101, it is the sense of Congress that the 
4

labor organizations that primarily represent workers 
9
in manufacturing to leverage their knowledge, re-
10
sources, applied research, experimental development, 
11
and programs to foster manufacturing in the United 
12
States so as to anticipate and prepare for emer-
13
