sary of the 1992 Los Angeles insurrection; 
Whereas, on March 3, 1991, 4 White Los Angeles Police De-
partment officers savagely beat Rodney King, a Black 
man, during a traffic stop following an alleged traffic vio-
lation; 
Whereas the beating of Rodney King by the 4 White police

often subjected to unfair and brutal treatment by police 
officers; 
Whereas, on April 29, 1992, following a trial on charges of 
excessive use of force, the 4 White police officers were ac-
quitted by a mostly White jury; 
Whereas many Black Americans felt that the justice system 
had failed them by acquitting the 4 White police officers; 
Whereas the acquittal of the 4 White police officers by a 
mostly White jury led to a 5-day insurrection in Los An-
geles, which created an environment of despair, disrup-
tion, and violence; 
Whereas more than 60 people were killed, more than 2,000 
people were injured, and more than 11,000 people were 
arrested, and there was more than $1,000,000,000 in 
property damages to local homes and businesses during 
the insurrection; 
Whereas Congresswoman Maxine Waters provided critical 
leadership during and after the insurrection, coura-
geously speaking on numerous local and national radio 
and television programs and publishing statements calling 
for attention to the urgent issues of poverty, racism, dis-
crimination, and exclusion, issues that burdened the lives 
of millions of Black Americans in Los Angeles County, 
as well as other communities throughout the United 
States; 
Whereas Congresswoman Maxine Waters had the courage to 
speak for people in the Black community who felt ex-
cluded from the political process and explain why they 
were angry; 
Whereas despite considerable social progress during the 30 
years since the 1992 Los Angeles insurrection, the issues

of poverty, racism, discrimination, and exclusion continue 
to have a profound impact upon individuals, families, and 
communities throughout the United States; 
Whereas, during the 30 years since the 1992 Los Angeles in-
surrection took place, numerous Black Americans, includ-
ing George Floyd, Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Breonna 
Taylor, Philando Castile, Daunte Wright, and Patrick 
Lyoya, have been killed by police officers in the United 
States without due process; 
Whereas there have been numerous peaceful protests in com-
munities throughout the United States in response to the 
killings of Black Americans by police officers; and 
Whereas, in honor of the April 29, 2022, anniversary of the 
1992 Los Angeles insurrection, community leaders across 
Los Angeles organized activities to commemorate the in-
justices that occurred in 1992 and continue their work to 
prevent tragedies like the beating of Rodney King and 
the acts of violence that were committed during the in-
surrection from happening again: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
