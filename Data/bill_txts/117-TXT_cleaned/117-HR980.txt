after-school programs daily, covering the costs of nearly 
2,100,000,000 nutritious meals and snacks each year; 
Whereas research has found that participation in CACFP re-
duces the prevalence of children who are overweight or 
underweight, which highlights the continual importance 
of updated and accurate nutritional information; 
Whereas CACFP increases the quality of child care, espe-
cially for children in low-income communities; 
Whereas 16,000 child care centers currently face permanent 
closure because of increased costs and burdens from the 
COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas CACFP increases the effectiveness and viability of 
child care centers and adult day care homes for many 
providers, especially in rural areas; 
Whereas CACFP improves the cognitive, social, emotional, 
and physical health and development of children, leading 
to more favorable outcomes such as— 
(1) a decreased likelihood of being hospitalized; 
(2) an increased likelihood of healthy weight gain; 
and 
(3) an increased likelihood of a more varied diet, in-
cluding increased consumption of vegetables; 
Whereas the innovative approach to CACFP implementation, 
which pairs child care homes and centers, adult day care 
centers, and after-school sites with either a nonprofit 
sponsoring organization or a State agency, highlights a 
unique public-private partnership that supports working 
families and small businesses; and 
Whereas the third week of March is annually recognized as 
‘‘National CACFP Week’’ to raise awareness of the child
