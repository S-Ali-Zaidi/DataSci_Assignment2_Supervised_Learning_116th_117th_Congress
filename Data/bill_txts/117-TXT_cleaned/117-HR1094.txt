Whereas approximately 1,500 American Indian and Alaska 
Native missing persons have been entered into the Na-
tional Crime Information Center throughout the United 
States, and approximately 2,700 cases of murder and 
nonnegligent homicide offenses have been reported to the 
Federal Government’s Uniform Crime Reporting Pro-
gram; 
Whereas, in 2020, Savanna’s Act and the Not Invisible Act 
were signed into law to address this lack of data and to 
improve law enforcement coordination to address the 
number of missing and murdered American Indian and 
Alaska Native women; and 
Whereas in previous years, May 5 has been designated as the 
day of remembrance for ‘‘Missing and Murdered Native 
Women and Girls’’ in honor of the birth date of Hanna 
Harris, a member of the Northern Cheyenne Tribe, who 
was murdered after being reported missing by her family 
in Lame Deer, Montana: Now, therefore, be it
