•HR 1775 IH
(1) There is a role for an international organi-
1
zation to help mitigate infectious diseases that re-
2
spect no boundaries. 
3
(2) The United States depends on an effective 
4
WHO to make good and well informed public health 
5
decisions to contain infectious diseases. 
6
(3) The WHO has played a critical role in ad-
7
dressing and mitigating infectious diseases, such as 
8
the 1979 eradication of smallpox, which eradication 
9
the WHO coordinated through a sustained global ef-
10
fort. 
11
(4) Without accurate information, the WHO 
12
cannot advise Member States properly on the risks 
13
posed by infectious diseases. 
14
(5) There are credible reports that in 2006, 
15
2009, and 2011 the Government of Ethiopia mis-
16
represented the nature and seriousness of cholera 
17
epidemics in that country to the WHO with a view 
18
towards minimizing the potential damage to their 
19
economy. 
20
(A) Those misrepresentations diminished 
21
the WHO’s effectiveness and the WHO trans-
22
mitted inaccurate and misleading information 
23
regarding the presence of cholera to partici-
24
pating states.

(B) Other Member States relied on the 
1
misleading and inaccurate information that the 
2
WHO communicated to them to formulate pub-
3
lic health policy, resulting in loss of life, injury, 
4
and damage to property and commercial inter-
5
ests to citizens outside of Ethiopia as a con-
6
sequence of that country’s misrepresentations 
7
to the WHO. 
8
(6) There are credible reports that WHO Mem-
9
ber States misrepresented facts concerning the 
10
Ebola outbreak to that organization with a view to-
11
wards minimizing the commercial impact that a 
12
widely disseminated understanding of the risks 
13
posed by the Ebola epidemic may have caused in 
14
their individual economies. 
15
(A) Those misrepresentations diminished 
16
the WHO’s effectiveness, and the WHO trans-
17
mitted inaccurate and misleading information 
18
regarding the communicability of Ebola to par-
19
ticipating States. 
20
(B) Other Member States relied on the

2
representations to the WHO.

(7) During the onset of the COVID–19 pan-
4
demic, China misrepresented the seriousness and na-
5
ture of the novel coronavirus to the WHO, with a 
6
view towards minimizing the potential damage to 
7
their economy and international reputation. 
8
(A) Those misrepresentations diminished 
9
the WHO’s effectiveness and the WHO trans-
10
mitted inaccurate and misleading information 
11
regarding the communicability of the novel 
12
coronavirus to participating States. 
13
(B) Other Member States relied on the 
14
misleading and inaccurate information that the 
15

and damage to property and commercial inter-
18
