SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) The struggle to end discrimination against 
8
people of African descent is a global challenge, and

•HR 1134 IH
one that is central to the United States commitment 
1
to human rights. 
2
(2) Targeted exclusion, violence, and discrimi-
3
nation against people of African descent continues 
4
around the world. 
5
(3) Issues range from the fight for ancestral 
6
lands in Latin America, hate crimes resulting in in-
7
jury and death in Europe, to profiling and excessive 
8
use of force by law enforcement in the United States 
9
and abroad, and continuing global disparities in 
10
health, education, employment, housing, and other 
11
sectors. 
12
(4) It is imperative that the world actively ad-
13
dress the vestiges of slavery and colonialism that 
14
have long hindered racial equality and justice and 
15
prevented the recognition of the important contribu-
16
tions of people of African descent to the world. 
17
(5) The International Decade for People of Af-
18
rican Descent, from January 1, 2015, to December 
19
31, 2025, offers an opportunity to address these 
20
issues domestically and globally through coordinated 
21
government and civil society strategies, that include 
22
the private sector.
