SEC. 2. PURPOSES. 
6
The purposes of this Act are— 
7
(1) to ensure that Pacific salmon trends in 
8
Alaska regarding productivity and abundance are 
9
characterized and that research needs are identified; 
10
(2) to prioritize scientific research needs for Pa-
11
cific salmon in Alaska;

(3) to address the increased variability or de-
1
cline in Pacific salmon returns in Alaska by creating 
2
a coordinated salmon research strategy; and 
3
(4) to support collaboration and coordination 
4
for Pacific salmon conservation efforts in Alaska. 
5
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
6
It is the sense of Congress that— 
7
(1) salmon are an essential part of Alaska’s 
8
fisheries, including subsistence, commercial, and rec-
9
reational uses, and there is an urgent need to better 
10
understand the freshwater and marine biology and 
11
ecology of salmon, a migratory species that crosses 
12
many borders, and for a coordinated salmon re-
13
search strategy to address salmon returns that are 
14
in decline or experiencing increased variability; 
15
(2) salmon are an essential element for the 
16
well-being and health of Alaskans; and 
17
(3) there is a unique relationship for people of 
18
Indigenous heritage who rely on salmon for subsist-
19
ence and traditional and cultural practices.
