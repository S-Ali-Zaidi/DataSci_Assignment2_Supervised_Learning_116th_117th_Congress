Condemning the growing hostility towards Christians and

tice one’s faith, including—

enjoyed by the people of these States, of worshiping Al-
mighty God agreeably to their consciences, is not only 
among the choicest of their blessings, but also of their 
rights’’; and 
(2) James Madison who stated that the free exercise 
of religion ‘‘is in its nature an unalienable right’’; 
Whereas religion and its moral basis is fundamental to the 
success of our republic, which was recognized by our

ligious people’’; 
Whereas religious liberty for all Americans is guaranteed in 
the First Amendment to the Constitution, which states, 
‘‘Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment 
of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof’’; 
Whereas Article VI of the Constitution prohibits religious 
tests for individuals seeking any office or public trust 
under the United States; 
Whereas the bipartisan Religious Freedom Restoration Act 
prohibits the Federal Government from substantially bur-
dening the exercise of religion, unless the Federal Gov-
ernment can demonstrate that such a burden is the least 
restrictive means of achieving a compelling government 
interest; 
Whereas hostility towards Christians and individuals of faith 
in the United States is prevalent in modern American 
culture and governmental institutions; 
Whereas prominent Christian leaders have expressed concern 
about growing hostility towards Christians in the United 
States, including— 
(1) Pastor Andrew Brunson who stated that ‘‘perse-
cution is still coming and it’s coming quickly and it’s 
coming soon’’ and recognized ‘‘the hostility that’s rising 
in our society toward followers of Jesus’’; and 
(2) Franklin Graham has stated that ‘‘hostility to-
ward Christians in the United States is on the rise and 
will grow unless we stand up for our freedoms of religion 
and conscience’’;

Whereas sexual orientation and gender identity laws suppress

Whereas Christians have been targeted for prayer in the pub-
lic square, including at public schools and public meet-
ings; 
Whereas Christian students have been told by public school 
teachers that they may not read the Bible during class 
reading time; 
Whereas the age at which sex education is taught in public 
schools and the content of such programs, including rede-
fined views of abstinence, contraceptives, sexual orienta-
tion, and gender identity display a hatred towards Chris-
tian and other faith-based beliefs on sex, sexuality, gen-
der, and marriage; 
Whereas during the COVID–19 pandemic, Christian pastors 
were arrested for holding worship services, churches were 
fined for holding worship services, and local governments

LGBTQ+ agenda abroad and sought to expand abortion 
worldwide, including in countries with strong religious 
and moral values; 
Whereas through attempts to dismantle the Hyde Amend-
ment, the Biden administration and Democratic Members 
of Congress are seeking to force all Americans to pay for 
abortions despite their sincerely held religious beliefs on 
life; 
Whereas 219 Democratic Members of Congress voted in favor 
of H.R. 8296, the Women’s Health Protection Act, which 
would impose abortion on-demand until birth nationwide 
and override State and Federal conscience protection 
laws, including the Religious Freedom Restoration Act; 
Whereas Democratic efforts to pass a Federal law imposing 
abortion on-demand until birth and fund abortions at 
Federal taxpayer expense are an attack on Christians 
and other religious Americans that hold religious beliefs 
on life;
