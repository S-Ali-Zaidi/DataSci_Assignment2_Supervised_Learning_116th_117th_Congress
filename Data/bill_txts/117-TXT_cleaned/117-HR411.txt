RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives to 
recognize the crisis of violence against Native women. 
Whereas according to a study commissioned by the Depart-
ment of Justice, in some Tribal communities American 
Indian women face murder rates that are more than 10 
times the national average; 
Whereas according to the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, homicide was the third leading cause of death 
among American Indian and Alaska Native women be-
tween 10 and 24 years of age and the sixth leading cause 
of death for American Indian and Alaska Native women 
between 20 and 44 years of age; 
Whereas Native women face some of the highest levels of vio-
lence of any group, but there is little data on the number

of missing American Indian and Alaska Native women in 
the United States; 
Whereas American Indians and Alaska Natives are 2.5 times 
more likely to experience violent crimes and at least 2 
times more likely to experience rape or sexual assault 
crimes than people who are not American Indians or 
Alaska Natives; 
Whereas 97 percent of female and 90 percent of male Amer-
ican Indian and Alaska Native victims report being vic-
timized by a non-Indian; 
Whereas according to a 2010 Government Accountability Of-
fice report, the Offices of the United States Attorneys de-
clined to prosecute nearly 52 percent of violent crimes 
that occur in Indian country; 
Whereas the Indian Law and Order Commission issued a re-
port entitled ‘‘A Roadmap for Making Native America 
Safer’’, that recommends the restoration of the inherent 
authority of Tribal courts; and 
Whereas Tribal communities should be able to protect them-
selves from domestic violence, sexual assault, dating vio-
lence, stalking, sex trafficking, violence against children, 
violence against elders, and from violence committed 
against members of the Tribal justice system: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-

resentatives to recognize the crisis of violence against Na-

tive women.
