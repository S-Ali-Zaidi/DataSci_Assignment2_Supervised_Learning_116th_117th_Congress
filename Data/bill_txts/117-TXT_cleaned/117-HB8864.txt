‘‘§ 4203. Fees

tled to an award of reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.

•HR 8864 IH
Such a presumption can be rebutted by a showing that

such an award would be unreasonable or that special cir-
2
cumstances exist that would make such an award unjust, 
3
as determined by the court.

‘‘(b) PREVAILING PARTY.—For the purposes of sub-
5
section (a), the moving party is considered to have pre-
6
vailed on the special motion to dismiss if the court grants

the special motion to dismiss under section 4201(d), and 
8
if the responding party did not amend or withdraw the 
9
claim until after the end of the 5-day notice period set 
10
forth in section 4201(a). 
11
‘‘(c) BAD FAITH FILINGS.—If a court finds that a 
12
special motion to dismiss was filed in bad faith and solely 
13
intended to cause delay, there shall be a rebuttable pre-
14
sumption that the responding party is entitled to an award 
15
of reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in re-
16
sponding to the special motion to dismiss. Such a pre-
17
sumption can be rebutted by a showing that such an 
18
award would be unreasonable or that special cir-
19
cumstances exist that would make such an award unjust,

as determined by the court.
