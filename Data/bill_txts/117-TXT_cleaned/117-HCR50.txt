CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the Congress that the withdrawal 
of American Forces from the country of Afghanistan 
does not undermine or diminish the sacrifice, efforts, 
and accomplishments of our members of the Armed 
Forces, diplomats, humanitarians, allies, and partners. 
Whereas the United States was viciously attacked by the 
murderous terrorist group al-Qaida on September 11, 
2001;

Whereas al-Qaida was based in the country of Afghanistan, 
which was governed by the ruthless and oppressive 
Taliban regime; 
Whereas the United States led an international coalition of 
military forces into Afghanistan to destroy al-Qaida, kill 
or capture Osama Bin Laden, and depose the Taliban 
government; 
Whereas hundreds of thousands of United States members of 
the Armed Forces, diplomats, and humanitarians de-
ployed to Afghanistan or supported operations from afar; 
Whereas for nearly 2 decades, the United States was spared 
from further major attacks by international terror orga-
nizations; and 
Whereas the withdrawal of the presence of the United States 
in Afghanistan had led to the collapse of the Afghan gov-
ernment, return of the Taliban to Afghan rule, and great 
heartache for so many: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate 
1
concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that— 
2
(1) the men and women who undertook the ef-
3
forts of the past years in Afghanistan provided he-
4
roic service to the country; 
5
(2) the peace our country experienced is a di-
6
rect result of the actions of our brave members of 
7
the Armed Forces, diplomats, and humanitarians; 
8
(3) despite the chaotic end to operations in Af-
9
ghanistan, their service is something to be remem-
10
bered, lauded, and honored; and
