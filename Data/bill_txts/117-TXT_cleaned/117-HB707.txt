SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
The Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The 23d Headquarters, Special Troops, 
3
comprised of the 23d Headquarters and Head-
4
quarters Company, Special Troops, the 603d Engi-
5
neer Camouflage Battalion, the 406th Combat Engi-
6
neer Company, the 3132d Signal Service Company 
7
and the Signal Company, Special, 23d Head-
8
quarters, Special Troops and the 3133d Signal Serv-
9
ice Company were top-secret units of the United 
10
States Army that served in Europe during World 
11
War II. 
12
(2) The 23d Headquarters, Special Troops, was 
13
actively engaged in battlefield operations from June 
14
of 1944 through March of 1945. The 3133d Signal 
15
Service Company was engaged in operations in Italy 
16
in 1945. 
17
(3) The deceptive activities of these units were 
18
integral to several Allied victories across Europe and 
19
reduced American casualties. 
20
(4) In evaluating the performance of these units 
21
after the War, a U.S. Army analysis found that 
22
‘‘Rarely, if ever, has there been a group of such a 
23
few men which had so great an influence on the out-
24
come of a major military campaign.’’.

(5) Many Ghost Army soldiers were citizen-sol-
1
diers recruited from art schools, advertising agen-
2
cies, communications companies, and other creative 
3
and technical professions. 
4
(6) The first four members of the 23d Head-
5
quarters, Special Troops, landed on D-Day and two 
6
became casualties while creating false beach landing 
7
sites. 
8
(7) The 23d Headquarters, Special Troops, se-
9
cret deception operations commenced in France on 
10
June 14, 1944, when Task Force Mason, a 17-man 
11
detachment of the 23d led by First Lieutenant Ber-
12
nard Mason, landed at Omaha Beach. Task Force 
13
Mason conducted Operation ELEPHANT between 1 
14
and 4 July, 1944, to draw enemy fire and protect 
15
the 980th Field Artillery Battalion (VIII Corps) as 
16
part of the Normandy Campaign. 
17
(8) Operation ELEPHANT was a prelude to 
18
21 full-scale tactical deceptions completed by the 
19
23d Headquarters, Special Troops. 
20
(9) Often operating on or near the front lines, 
21
the 23d Headquarters, Special Troops, used inflat-
22
able tanks, artillery, airplanes and other vehicles, ad-
23
vanced engineered soundtracks, and skillfully crafted 
24
radio trickery to create the illusion of sizable Amer-
25

ican forces where there were none and to draw the 
1
enemy away from Allied troops. 
2
(10) The 3132d and the 3133d Signal Service 
3
Companies, activated in Pine Camp (now Fort 
4
Drum), New York, at the Army Experimental Sta-
5
tion in March 1944, were the only two active duty 
6
‘‘sonic deception’’ ground combat units in World 
7
War II. 
8
(11) Soldiers of the 23d Headquarters, Special 
9
Troops, impersonated other, larger Army units by 
10
sewing counterfeit patches onto their uniforms, 
11
painting false markings on their vehicles, and cre-
12
ating phony headquarters staffed by fake generals, 
13
all in an effort to feed false information to Axis 
14
spies. 
15
(12) During the Battle of the Bulge, the 23d 
16
Headquarters, Special Troops, created counterfeit 
17
radio traffic to mask the efforts of General George 
18
Patton’s Third Army as it mobilized to break 
19
through to the 101st Airborne and elements of 10th 
20
Armored Division in the besieged Belgian town of 
21
Bastogne. 
22
(13) In its final mission, Operation VIERSEN, 
23
in March 1945, the 23d Headquarters, Special 
24
Troops, conducted a tactical deception that drew 
25

•HR 707 IH
German units down the Rhine River and away from 
1
the Ninth Army, allowing the Ninth Army to cross 
2
the Rhine into Germany. On this mission, the 1,100 
3
men of the Ghost Army, with the assistance of other 
4
units, impersonated forty thousand men, or two 
5
complete divisions of American forces, by using fab-
6
ricated radio networks, soundtracks of construction 
7
work and artillery fire, and more than 600 inflatable 
8
vehicles. According to a military intelligence officer 
9
of the 79th Infantry, ‘‘There is no doubt that Oper-
10
ation VIERSEN materially assisted in deceiving the 
11
enemy with regard to the real dispositions and inten-
12
tions of this Army.’’. 
13
(14) Three soldiers of the 23d Headquarters, 
14
Special Troops, gave their lives and dozens were in-
15
jured in carrying out their mission. 
16
(15) In April 1945, the 3133d Signal Service 
17
Company conducted Operation CRAFTSMAN in 
18
support of Operation SECOND WIND, the success-
19
ful allied effort to break through the German defen-
20
sive position to the north of Florence, Italy, known 
21
as the Gothic Line. Along with an attached platoon 
22
of British engineers, who were inflatable decoy spe-
23
cialists, the 3133d Signal Service Company used 
24

•HR 707 IH
sonic deception to misrepresent troop locations along 
1
this defensive line. 
2
(16) The activities of the 23d Headquarters, 
3
Special Troops and the 3133d Signal Service Com-
4
pany remained highly classified for more than forty 
5
years after the war and were never formally recog-
6
nized. The extraordinary accomplishments of this 
7
unit are deserving of belated official recognition. 
8
(17) The United States is eternally grateful to 
9
the soldiers of the 23d Headquarters, Special Troops 
10
and the 3133d Signal Service Company for their 
11
proficient use of innovative tactics throughout World 
12
War II, which saved lives and made significant con-
13
tributions to the defeat of the Axis powers.
