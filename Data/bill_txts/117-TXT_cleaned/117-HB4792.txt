SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The People’s Republic of China and the 
3
Chinese Communist Party represent the foremost 
4
national security threat faced by the United States. 
5
(2) The People’s Republic of China and the 
6
Chinese Communist Party are founded on the prin-
7
ciples antithetical to human freedom and dignity in-
8
cluding Communism and authoritarianism. 
9
(3) The People’s Republic of China and the 
10
Chinese Communist Party seek to undermine free

societies around the world and establish an alter-
1
native world order rooted in authoritarianism. 
2
(4) In November 2012, at the 17th CCP Con-
3
gress, General Secretary Xi Jinping first announced 
4
his vision for achieving ‘‘the Chinese dream of na-
5
tional rejuvenation’’ and military and economic 
6
dominance. 
7
(5) The People’s Republic of China currently 
8
has the world’s second-largest economy in terms of 
9
nominal GDP ($14.14 trillion) and the largest in 
10
terms of purchasing power parity (PPP) GDP 
11
($27.31 trillion). In 2000, the People’s Republic of 
12
China controlled only 4 percent of the global econ-
13
omy, and the United States controlled 31 percent. 
14
Today, the People’s Republic of China stands at 15 
15
percent and the United States’ share has dropped to 
16
24 percent. 
17
(6) The growth of the People’s Republic of Chi-
18
na’s centrally controlled economy has been fueled 
19
largely by tools of economic coercion, including intel-
20
lectual property theft and economic espionage of 
21
U.S. companies. In 2019 alone, one in five North 
22
American-based companies said that Chinese firms 
23
had stolen their intellectual property (IP) within the 
24
last year.

(7) Former Secretary of Defense Mark Esper 
1
has stated that the People’s Republic of China ‘‘is 
2
perpetrating the greatest intellectual property theft 
3
in human history’’. 
4
(8) In addition to its economic aggression and 
5
military modernization, the People’s Republic of 
6
China conducts political warfare and disinformation 
7
campaigns against the United States and other de-
8
mocracies. It frequently targets academia, the 
9
media, business, and cultural institutions to sup-
10
press criticism and promote positive views of the 
11
CCP. 
12
(9) The foremost victims of the People’s Repub-
13
lic of China and the Chinese Communist Party are 
14
the Chinese people who continue to suffer under 
15
communist authoritarian rule. 
16
(10) The People’s Republic of China continues 
17
to perpetuate a genocide against the Uyghur Mus-
18
lims in Xinjiang province, in addition to brutal 
19
crackdowns against the people of Tibet and Hong 
20
Kong. 
21
(11) The CCP continues to obfuscate the ori-
22
gins of the COVID–19 pandemic which started in 
23
Wuhan, China and has refused to allow an impartial

2
(12) Manifestations of expressions of racism, 
3
bigotry, discrimination, anti-Asian rhetoric, and xen-
4
ophobia against people of Asian descent are contrary 
5
to the values we hold dearest as Americans, counter-
6
productive to countering the CCP’s malign influence,
