RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the cultural and historical significance of the 
Assyrian New Year.

New Year, an event known to many by several different 
names including Kha b’Neesan, Ha b’ Nisin, Akitu, or 
Resha d’Shet; 
Whereas Kha b’Neesan is not only the first day of the new 
year, but it also marks the start of spring and serves as 
a symbol of revival;

endar; 
Whereas Assyrian New Year is typically recognized and cele-
brated by millions of Assyrians in the form of marches,

Whereas men and women will gather together in traditional 
clothes and dance in parks, or families may come to-
gether in cultural centers to enjoy hours of poetry; 
Whereas Assyrian women and girls gather flowers and herbs 
that are then strung from the roof of their homes, a cen-
turies old tradition known as Diquna d’Nissan, meaning 
the ‘‘beard of Spring’’; 
Whereas the Assyrian community has a vibrant history span-
ning over six centuries; 
Whereas, in ancient Assyria, the New Year festival was cele-
brated for 12 days; 
Whereas this occasion was the biggest festival in the ancient 
Assyrian and Babylonian Empires; 
Whereas historical cuneiform tablets have shown that the 
New Year celebrations were the most significant events 
of the year; 
Whereas tens of thousands of people from all over the Assyr-
ian Empire would travel to its capital city, Nineveh, to 
participate in the massive celebrations led by the Assyr-
ian King; 
Whereas it was also common practice for couples across As-
syria to be married in groups at a time, and later, the 
brides would pay a visit to every household in their city 
to receive blessings and gifts; 
Whereas, following the fall of the Assyrian Empire, the As-
syrian community faced numerous hardships and several 
restrictions that were placed on their culture; 
Whereas for example, after the formation of Turkey, Assyr-
ians were prohibited from holding public celebrations of 
the New Year;

Whereas it was not until 2005 that Assyrians in Turkey were 
first permitted to publicly celebrate Kha b’Neesan; 
Whereas for Assyrians, both in the United States and abroad, 
celebrating Kha b’Neesan serves as a vital link to pre-
serving their history and culture; 
Whereas 4,500,000 Assyrians are currently dispersed across 
the globe with members of the diaspora comprising nearly 
one-third of the world’s population; 
Whereas estimates place approximately 120,000 individuals 
of Assyrian heritage in the United States; 
Whereas Kha b’Neesan serves to remind the United States 
of the many substantial contributions the Assyrian com-
munity has made to the world and to the social fabric of 
the United States; and 
Whereas it is imperative that members of the Assyrian com-
munity across the globe feel seen, valued, and encouraged 
to celebrate their cultural heritage: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—

(1) expresses its appreciation for the vibrancy,
