RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the designation of July 30, 2021, 
as ‘‘National Whistleblower Appreciation Day’’. 
Whereas, in 1777, before the passage of the Bill of Rights, 
10 sailors and marines blew the whistle on misconduct 
that was harmful to the United States; 
Whereas the Continental Congress unanimously supported 
the whistleblowers in words and deeds, including by re-
leasing Government records and authorizing payment for 
legal expenses incurred by the whistleblowers incurred in 
defending against a retaliatory criminal libel lawsuit 
brought against them; 
Whereas, on July 30, 1778, in demonstration of their full 
support for whistleblowers, the Members of the Conti-

nental Congress unanimously enacted the first whistle-
blower legislation in the United States that read: ‘‘Re-
solved, That it is the duty of all persons in the service 
of the United States, as well as all other inhabitants 
thereof, to give the earliest information to Congress or 
other proper authority of any misconduct, frauds or mis-
demeanors committed by any officers or persons in the 
service of these states, which may come to their knowl-
edge’’; 
Whereas whistleblowers risk their careers, jobs, and reputa-
tions by reporting waste, fraud, and abuse to the proper 
authorities; 
Whereas, in providing the proper authorities with lawful dis-
closures, whistleblowers save the taxpayers of the United 
States billions of dollars each year and serve the public 
interest by ensuring that the United States remains an 
ethical and safe place; and 
Whereas it is the public policy of the United States to en-
courage, in accordance with Federal law (including the 
Constitution of the United States, rules, and regulations) 
and consistent with the protection of classified informa-
tion (including sources and methods of detection of clas-
sified information), honest and good faith reporting of 
misconduct, fraud, misdemeanors, and other crimes to 
the appropriate authority at the earliest time possible: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the designation of ‘‘National Whis-

(2) ensures that the Federal Government imple-
