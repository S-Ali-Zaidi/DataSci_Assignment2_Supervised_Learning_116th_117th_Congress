TION PROCESS. 
10
It is the sense of Congress that— 
11
(1) the United States is a beacon of hope that 
12
sets the standard of democracy around the world; 
13
(2) the people of the United States should have 
14
full faith in their electoral process; 
15
(3) the United States must ensure that elec-
16
tions are free, fair, and secure; 
17
(4) transparency is at the core of the demo-
18
cratic process, and the 2020 election raised concerns 
19
of election irregularities; and 
20
(5) at the very least, Congress must provide the 
21
American people with the confidence that their elec-
22
tions are secure.
