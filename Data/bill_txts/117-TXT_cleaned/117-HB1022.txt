SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
1
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following find-
2
ings: 
3
(1) According to the analyses of veteran suicide 
4
published by the Department of Veterans Affairs in 
5
August 2016 entitled ‘‘Suicide Among Veterans and 
6
Other Americans’’ and in June 2018 entitled ‘‘VA 
7
National Suicide Date Report’’— 
8
(A) an average of 20 veterans died by sui-
9
cide each day during 2014; 
10
(B) mental health disorders, including 
11
major depression and other mood disorders, 
12
have been associated with increased risk for sui-
13
cide; 
14
(C) the proportion of users of the Veterans 
15
Health Administration with mental health con-
16
ditions or substance use disorders increased 
17
from approximately 27 percent in 2001 to more 
18
than 40 percent in 2014; and 
19
(D) overall, suicide rates are highest 
20
among patients with mental health and sub-
21
stance use disorder diagnoses who are in treat-
22
ment and lower among those who received a 
23
mental health diagnoses but were not at risk 
24
enough to require enhanced care from a mental 
25
health provider.

(2) Pairing a service dog with a veteran costs 
1
approximately $25,000, including training of the 
2
service dog as well as training of the veteran with 
3
the service dog and follow-up services and support. 
4
(3) Organizations like K9s For Warriors and 
5
other members of the Association of Service Dog 
6
Providers for Military Veterans have proven track- 
7
records of training service dogs for veterans with se-
8
vere post-traumatic stress disorder and dramatically 
9
improving those veterans’ quality of life, ability to 
10
re-enter society, and, most importantly, their 
11
chances of survival. 
12
(4) New, rigorous scientific research provides 
13
persuasive weight to the growing anecdotal evidence 
14
that service dogs ameliorate the symptoms associ-
15
ated with post-traumatic stress disorder, and in par-
16
ticular, help prevent veteran suicide. 
17
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
18
gress that the Department of Veterans Affairs must be 
19
more effective in its approach to reducing the burden of 
20
veteran suicide connected to mental health disorders, in-
21
cluding post-traumatic stress disorder.
