Whereas Nowruz is celebrated by Iranian Americans of all 
backgrounds, including those with Baha’i, Christian, 
Jewish, Muslim, Zoroastrian, and nonreligious back-

Whereas Nowruz serves to remind the United States of the 
many lasting contributions of the Persian civilization to 
the world and the noteworthy impact of Iranian Ameri-

in all sectors of American public life, including as govern-
ment, military, and law enforcement officials working to

Whereas Iranian Americans maintain strong ties to the peo-
ple of Iran and desire to see a democratic Iran that re-
spects human rights; 
Whereas Congress supports the Iranian people’s right to free-
dom of expression and speech; and 
Whereas Nowruz embodies the tradition that each individ-

nects the Persian New Year to the values of human 
rights: Now, therefore, be it
