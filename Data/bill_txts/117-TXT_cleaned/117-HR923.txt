Education Month. 
Whereas a competitive global economy requires workers who 
are prepared for skilled professions; 
Whereas at least 15,000,000 new workers will be needed for 
the United States infrastructure in the next decade, in-
cluding designing, building, and operating transportation, 
housing, utilities, and telecommunications; 
Whereas the COVID–19 pandemic has displaced millions of 
American workers and fundamentally shifted entire in-

upskilling and reskilling opportunities to ensure a quick 
and equitable recovery; 
Whereas career and technical education (referred to in this 
preamble as ‘‘CTE’’) ensures that competitive and skilled 
workers are ready, willing, and capable of holding jobs in 
high-wage, high-skill, and in-demand career fields such as 
science, technology, engineering, art and design, mathe-
matics, nursing, allied health, construction, information 
technology, energy sustainability, and many other career 
fields that are vital in keeping the United States competi-
tive in the global economy; 
Whereas CTE helps the United States meet the very real and 
immediate challenges of economic development, student 
achievement, and global competitiveness; 
Whereas the United States has 30,000,000 jobs providing an 
average income of $55,000 per year that do not require 
a bachelor’s degree yet increasingly require some level of 
postsecondary education; 
Whereas over 11,000,000 students are enrolled in CTE 
across the country at the secondary and postsecondary 
levels, with CTE programs in thousands of CTE centers, 
comprehensive high schools, career academies, and CTE 
high schools, and nearly 1,000 2-year colleges; 
Whereas CTE matches employability skills with workforce de-
mand and provides relevant academic and technical 
coursework leading to industry-recognized credentials for 
secondary, postsecondary, and adult learners; 
Whereas CTE affords students the opportunity to gain the 
knowledge, skills, and credentials needed to secure ca-
reers in growing, high-demand fields;

Whereas secondary CTE is associated with a lower prob-
ability of dropping out of high school and a higher likeli-
hood of graduating on-time; 
Whereas, according to an American Federation of Teachers 
poll, 96 percent of parents approve of expanding access 
to CTE and other programs that prepare students for 
jobs; 
Whereas students at schools with highly integrated rigorous 
academic and CTE programs are significantly more likely 
to meet college and career readiness benchmarks than 
students at schools with less integrated programs; 
Whereas in 2018, Congress affirmed the importance of CTE 
by passing the Strengthening Career and Technical Edu-
cation for the 21st Century Act (Public Law 115–224), 
which supports program improvement in secondary and 
postsecondary CTE programs in all 50 States, the Dis-
trict of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin 
Islands, and outlying areas; and 
Whereas February 23, 2022, marks the 105th anniversary of 
the signing of the Act of February 23, 1917 (39 Stat. 
929, commonly known as the Smith-Hughes Vocational 
Education Act of 1917), which was the first major Fed-
eral investment in secondary CTE and laid the founda-
tion for the bipartisan, bicameral support for CTE that 
continues as of February 2022: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
