•HR 9244 IH
(1) Between 1977 and 2019, the export pro-
1
motion programs of the Department of Agriculture 
2
(in this section referred to as the ‘‘Programs’’) have 
3
added, on average, $9,600,000,000 per year to the 
4
value of United States agricultural exports, equal to 
5
a total of nearly $648,000,000,000, or 13.7 percent, 
6
in additional export revenue. 
7
(2) Between 1977 and 2019, the Programs 
8
have generated a net return of $24.50 for every dol-
9
lar invested. 
10
(3) Between 2002 and 2019, the Programs 
11
have contributed up to 225,800 full- and part-time 
12
jobs across the United States economy. 
13
(4) Between 2002 and 2019, the Programs 
14
have added up to $45,000,000,000 in gross eco-
15
nomic output and $22,300,000,000 in gross domes-
16
tic product. 
17
(5) Communities across the United States that 
18
produce agricultural commodities as varied as ap-
19
ples, blueberries, strawberries, cotton, beef, soy-
20
beans, rice, wheat, dairy, corn, citrus, wine, pork, 
21
peanuts, cranberries, lentils, tree nuts, timber, poul-
22
try, potatoes, and seafood, have utilized the Pro-
23
grams to increase the foreign market access of such 
24
communities.

(6) Private sector contributions have helped 
1
maintain the public-private partnership between the 
2
Department of Agriculture and private agricultural 
3
groups as the effective available funds from the De-
4
partment have declined, with private contributions 
5
representing approximately 70 to 77 percent of the 
6
funds available for export promotion from 2013 to 
7
2019. 
8
(7) Agricultural export promotion programs of 
9
foreign competitors have expanded at a far faster 
10
rate than the Programs, placing United States pro-
11
ducers at a competitive disadvantage in international 
12
markets. 
13
(8) The economic impact of the Programs has 
14
eroded in recent years, as funding for the Market 
15
Access Program has remained static since 2006, and 
16
funding for the Foreign Market Development Pro-
17
gram has remained static since 2002, while inflation 
18
has increased. 
19
(9) A recent academic analysis found that dou-
20
bling public funding for the Market Access Program 
21
and the Foreign Market Development Program, cou-
22
pled with increasing private contributions by 10 to 
23
20 percent, would result in average annual gains in
