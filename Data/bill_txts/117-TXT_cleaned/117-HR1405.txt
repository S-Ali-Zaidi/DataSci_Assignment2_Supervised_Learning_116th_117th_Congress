RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for replacing the term ‘‘Thank you for 
your service’’ with ‘‘Thank you for our freedom’’. 
Whereas the House of Representatives recognizes the brave 
service of members of the regular and reserve compo-
nents of the Armed Forces, veterans, and their families; 
Whereas the House of Representatives hereby renews its com-
mitment to support and thank these men and women for 
preserving our freedom so that Americans will always re-
member their crucial role in our history and our aspira-
tion for a world protected under the banner of freedom; 
Whereas, though Americans are proud to show appreciation 
for the service of members of the Armed Forces and vet-

erans, the real message should be direct and personal: 
‘‘Thank you for our freedom’’; 
Whereas, at the close of World War II, Chief of Naval Oper-
ations, Admiral Chester Nimitz, selected Roy ‘‘Butch’’ 
Voris to form a Navy flight exhibition team, later to be 
known as the Blue Angels, and, as the First Blue Angel, 
Butch created an image that became symbolic of the 
United States Navy, American patriotism, and American 
freedom; 
Whereas one day, while having lunch with a fellow aviator 
and wearing his ‘‘1st Blue’’ ball cap, someone walked by 
Butch’s table and said, ‘‘Thank you for your service’’; 
Whereas Butch’s friend realized that Butch was surprised so 
he explained that this was a phrase that people said to 
show appreciation for the military, and, without missing 
a beat, Butch announced for all to hear, ‘‘He should 
thank us for his freedom’’; 
Whereas Butch has since passed but his message should live 
on forever, and, in honor of all who currently serve in the 
Armed Forces, and our 20,000,000 living veterans, the 
House of Representatives proclaims that the best way to 
show recognition, respect, and honor for those who have 
and continue to put their lives on the line is to declare 
‘‘Thank you for our freedom’’; 
Whereas our Nation has many sacred obligations, including 
preparation of, and support for, the troops sent into 
harm’s way, and to care for them and their families when 
they return home; 
Whereas for far too long, our Nation has fallen short in our 
obligation to our military, and in addition to support and 
care, the Nation is are committed to ensuring that all our

currently serving members, veterans, and their families, 
caregivers, and survivors, receive the respect they have 
earned, and we declare ‘‘Thank you for our freedom’’ is 
to be embraced; 
Whereas this message will be the banner of freedom to unify 
our Nation; 
Whereas regardless of our personal preferences and leanings, 
the House of Representatives is united in the mission to 
keep our country free, and our ability to disagree is pro-
vided by the freedoms protected by these men and 
women; 
Whereas the House of Representatives calls on the President 
to support this message and aid in spreading this mes-
sage to the citizens of our country; 
Whereas the House of Representatives calls on Members of 
Congress to take this message back to their constituents 
and embrace ‘‘Thank you for our freedom’’; and 
Whereas the House of Representatives call on citizens of the 
United States, here and abroad, to show their support for 
the freedoms that have been provided for them, and 
among the many ways to express their thanks, we invite 
citizens to embrace ‘‘Thank you for our freedom’’ across 
all forms of communication and social media in apprecia-
tion to all who serve or have served: Now, therefore, be 
it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives ex-
1
presses support for the term ‘‘Thank you for our freedom’’

as the way to respect members of the Armed Forces and

veterans.
