quirements 
upon 
broker-dealers 
who 
publish 
1
quotations in such markets. 
2
(2) Rule 15c2–11 was promulgated in 1971, 
3
and has generally been understood to apply to OTC 
4
equity markets since that time. 
5
(3) The amendments to Rule 15c2–11 were 
6
based on the economic analysis of OTC equity mar-
7
kets. 
8
(4) The fixed-income markets are different in 
9
structure and function than OTC equity markets. 
10
(5) The fixed-income markets are critical to the 
11
ability of thousands of corporations’ ability to raise 
12
capital, and millions of consumers to obtain credit. 
13
(6) On December 16, 2021, the Securities and 
14
Exchange Commission issued a No-Action Letter 
15
purporting to apply Rule 15c2–11 to fixed-income 
16
markets in a manner that made significant changes 
17
to long-standing regulatory requirements, without a 
18
rulemaking process, without analysis of the costs 
19
and benefits of the action, and without regard for 
20
the input of the public.
