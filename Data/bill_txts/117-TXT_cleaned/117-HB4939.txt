1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The Nation, and every critical infrastruc-
3
ture sector, depends on reliable electricity. 
4
(2) Intelligent electronic devices, advanced ana-
5
lytics, and information systems used across the en-
6
ergy sector are essential to maintaining reliable op-
7
eration of the electric grid. 
8
(3) The cybersecurity threat landscape is con-
9
stantly changing and attacker capabilities are ad-
10
vancing rapidly, requiring ongoing modifications, ad-
11
vancements, and investments in technologies, proce-
12
dures, and workforce development to maintain secu-
13
rity. 
14
(4) It is in the national interest for Federal 
15
agencies to invest in innovative cybersecurity re-
16
search that informs and facilitates private sector in-
17
vestment and use of new and advanced cybersecurity 
18
tools and procedures to protect information systems. 
19
(5) The number of devices and systems con-
20
necting to the electric grid is increasing, and inte-
21
grating cybersecurity protections into information 
22
systems when they are designed and built is more ef-
23
fective than modifying products after installation to 
24
meet cybersecurity goals.

(6) An understanding of human factors can be 
1
leveraged to understand the behavior of cyber threat 
2
actors, develop strategies to counter threat actors, 
3
improve cybersecurity training programs, optimize 
4
the design of human-machine interfaces and cyberse-
5
curity tools, and increase the capacity of the energy
