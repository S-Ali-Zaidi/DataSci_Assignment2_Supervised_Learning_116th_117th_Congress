SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress makes the following findings: 
2
(1) Almost 3,000,000,000 people, representing 
3
more than one-third of the global population, rely on 
4
open fires or inefficient, polluting, and unsafe cook-
5
stoves using wood, charcoal, kerosene, agricultural 
6
waste, animal dung, coal, or other fuels. The major-
7
ity of people using these types of cookstoves and 
8
fuels are in developing countries in Asia, Africa, and 
9
Latin America. 
10
(2) Smoke from the use of traditional cook-
11
stoves and open fires contribute to household air pol-
12
lution that causes illnesses that disproportionately 
13
affect women and young children. Such illnesses in-
14
clude low birth weight, pneumonia, cardiovascular 
15
disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung 
16
cancer, and other respiratory illnesses. 
17
(3) The household air pollution caused by tradi-
18
tional cookstoves and open fires claims 4,000,000 
19
premature deaths annually, including 400,000 chil-
20
dren younger than 5 years of age, most of whom live 
21
in sub-Saharan Africa. Household air pollution does 
22
not remain in the home and contributes to more 
23
than 10 percent of global ambient air pollution. In 
24
some countries, such as Nepal, household air pollu-
25
tion contributes to more than 30 percent of ambient 
26
22:22 Dec 23, 2021

•HR 6316 IH
air pollution. In 2019, more than 600,000 deaths 
1
were attributed to ambient air pollution stemming 
2
from the household combustion of solid fuels. 
3
(4) According to the World Health Organiza-
4
tion, the large-scale use of wood, charcoal, and ker-
5
osene for traditional cooking fuel accounts for 1.5– 
6
3.0 percent of global CO2 emissions, which is a sig-
7
nificant contributor to air pollution.

SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
9
It is the policy of the United States to reduce the 
10
adverse effects of household energy use in its foreign as-
11
sistance programs and activities, as appropriate, including 
12
through— 
13
(1) applied research and development to im-
14
prove design, lower costs, promote technology adop-
15
tion, conduct health research and evaluation, and de-
16
velop global industry standards and testing protocols 
17
for cookstoves and fuels to help ensure minimum 
18
standards for efficiency and emissions to lower 
19
health and environmental impacts; 
20
(2) diplomatic engagement to encourage a com-
21
mercial market for clean cookstoves and fuels, re-
22
duce trade barriers, promote consumer awareness, 
23
improve access to large-scale carbon financing and 
24

other investment, and foster women-owned busi-
1
nesses along the entire business value chain; 
2
(3) international development projects to help 
3
build commercial businesses to manufacture, market, 
4
distribute, sell, and service clean cookstoves and 
5
fuels; 
6
(4) development efforts related to refugee 
7
camps, disaster relief, and long-term humanitarian 
8
and empowerment programs aimed at assisting 
9
women, girls, and other vulnerable populations; 
10
(5) financing or insurance to support projects 
11
that provide access to clean, affordable energy and 
12
energy savings through the manufacture, sale, and 
13
purchase of clean cookstoves and fuels; 
14
(6) dissemination of cookstove standards to 
15
lower environmental and health impacts associated 
16
with cook stoves through the International Organiza-
17
tion for Standardization process for household, insti-
18
tutional, or commercial use; and 
19
(7) political engagement with low-to-middle-in-
20
come countries to include cookstove and household 
21
energy emission reduction goals in their Nationally 
22
Determined Contributions (NDCs), guidance on im-
23
plementation of the NDCs, and monitoring and 
24
verification frameworks.
