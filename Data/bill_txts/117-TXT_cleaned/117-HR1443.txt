RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives to 
condemn the atrocities, war crimes, and crimes against 
humanity being perpetrated against Ukrainian children 
by the Government of Russia. 
Whereas, on February 24, 2022, Russia began a further mili-
tary invasion of Ukraine’s sovereign territory, that in ad-
dition to causing tens of thousands of Ukrainian civilian 
casualties has uniquely impacted the safety, health, edu-
cation, and human rights of Ukrainian children; 
Whereas Russia’s unprovoked invasion has caused over 
7,200,000 refugees and 6,900,000 internally displaced 
migrants, approximately 90 percent of whom are women 
and children, to flee the country as of September 13, 
2022;

Whereas the Independent International Commission of In-
quiry on Ukraine found that Russia committed war 
crimes in Ukraine including the rape, torture, and unlaw-
ful confinement of children as young as 4; 
Whereas at the height of the conflict nearly two-thirds of all 
Ukrainian children were displaced either internally or 
internationally and 379 children have been killed in the 
conflict as of September 19, 2022; 
Whereas during the bombardment of Mariupol on March 9, 
2022, the Russian military targeted and destroyed a hos-
pital maternity ward, killing at least 3 people, including 
one newborn, and wounding at least 17 others; 
Whereas, on March 16, 2022, a Russian airstrike targeted a 
theater in Mariupol that was being used as a civilian 
bomb shelter and which had the word ‘‘CHILDREN’’ 
written in large lettering visible on satellite images, kill-
ing up to 600 civilians, including a large number of chil-
dren who had been sheltering inside; 
Whereas Ukraine has accused Russian forces of using 
Ukrainian children as ‘‘human shields’’ while retreating 
from Bucha, Ukraine, and taking children hostage in 
multiple conflict zones across the country in order to pre-
vent locals from cooperating with the Ukrainian military; 
Whereas 16 children were among the hundreds of civilians 
killed by Russian troops during Russia’s occupation of 
Bucha; 
Whereas, on May 2, 2022, a Russian missile strike on a dor-

members in permanent marker on the bodies of their 
small children so they may be united with family if the 
parent is killed; 
Whereas prior to Russia’s further invasion of Ukraine in 
February 2022, approximately 4,230,000 children had 
been enrolled in Ukrainian schools, and the resulting con-
flict has caused a disruption in education for over half of 
those students; 
Whereas more than 2,400 education facilities have been dam-
aged and more than 200 destroyed as of September 5, 
2022; 
Whereas Russian military forces have attacked numerous ci-
vilian buildings that primarily serve women and children, 
including, as of May 10, 2022, approximately 200 health 
care facilities and an average of 22 schools a day since 
the beginning of the war; 
Whereas attacks near or on schools is in direct opposition to 
United Nations Security Council Resolution 2601 adopt-
ed in 2021, which condemns attacks on schools and calls 
for all necessary safeguards to protect the right to edu-
cation; 
Whereas more than 1 in 6 UNICEF-supported ‘‘safe schools’’ 
in eastern Ukraine, which pledge to remain open and 
keep students and staff safe during times of war, have 
been damaged or destroyed by Russian forces during the 
conflict; 
Whereas there is evidence of refugees fleeing the conflict 
being subject to human-trafficking activities, which dis-
proportionately target women, children, those travelling

Whereas an April 2022 survey conducted by the International 
Rescue Committee at Ukrainian refugee camps in Poland 
found that 28 percent of refugees felt they were at risk 
of human trafficking and 19 percent said they had al-
ready experienced some form of sexual abuse; 
Whereas the Department of State asserts that more than 
260,000 children have been deported to Russia to be 
forcibly adopted by Russian families; 
Whereas the mass deportation of people during conflict is 
classified as a war crime under international law, and the 
forcible transfer of children out of a group of people is 
classified as genocide under the 1948 Genocide Conven-
tion; 
Whereas, prior to February 24, Ukraine’s orphanages, board-
ing schools, and other similar institutions housed over 
91,000 children, one of the largest number of institu-
tionalized children of any European country, over half of 
whom are disabled, require specialized care, or are other-
wise vulnerable, and who now face heightened risk of 
trafficking, abuse, and other exploitation as a result of 
Russia’s invasion; 
Whereas according to UNICEF, the conflict in Ukraine will 
have a significant psychological impact on Ukrainian chil-
dren, likely requiring intensive psychological support; 
Whereas children who experience war or conflict are at 
heightened risk of developing anxiety disorders, depres-
sion, and long-term psychological trauma, and that these 
risks can increase the longer a child is displaced from his 
or her home, family members, school, friends, and/or nor-
mal routine;
