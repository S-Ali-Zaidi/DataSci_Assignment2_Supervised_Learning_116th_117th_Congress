RESOLUTION 
Calling on Vice President Michael R. Pence to convene and 
mobilize the principal officers of the executive depart-
ments of the Cabinet to activate section 4 of the 25th 
Amendment to declare President Donald J. Trump in-
capable of executing the duties of his office and to imme-
diately exercise powers as acting President. 
Whereas on Wednesday, January 6, 2021, the day fixed by 
the Constitution for the counting of electoral votes, Con-
gress experienced a massive violent invasion of the 
United States Capitol and its complex by a dangerous in-
surrectionary mob which smashed windows and used vio-
lent physical force and weapons to overpower and out-
maneuver the United States Capitol Police and facilitated

the illegal entry into the Capitol of hundreds, if not thou-
sands, of unauthorized persons (all of whom entered the 
Capitol complex without going through metal detectors 
and other security screening devices); 
Whereas, the insurrectionary mob threatened the safety and 
lives of the Vice President, the Speaker of the House, 
and the President pro tempore of the Senate, the first 
three individuals in the line of succession to the presi-
dency, as the rioters were recorded chanting ‘‘Hang Mike 
Pence’’ and ‘‘Where’s Nancy’’ when President Donald J. 
Trump tweeted to his supporters that ‘‘Mike Pence didn’t 
have the courage to do what should have been done to 
protect our country’’ after the Capitol had been overrun 
and the Vice President was in hiding; 
Whereas the insurrectionary mob attacked law enforcement 
officers, unleashed chaos and terror among Members and 
staffers and their families, occupied the Senate Chamber 
and Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office along with other lead-
ership offices, vandalized and pilfered government prop-
erty, and succeeded in interfering with the counting of 
electoral votes in the joint session of Congress; 
Whereas the insurrectionary mob’s violent attacks on law en-
forcement and invasion of the Capitol complex caused the 
unprecedented disruption of the Electoral College count 
process for a 4-hour period in both the House and the 
Senate, a dangerous and destabilizing impairment of the 
peaceful transfer of power that these insurrectionary riots 
were explicitly designed to cause; 
Whereas 5 Americans have died as a result of injuries or 
traumas suffered during this violent attack on Congress 
and the Capitol, including Capitol Police Officer Brian D. 
Sicknick and Ashli Babbitt, Rosanne Boyland, Kevin

Greeson, and Benjamin Phillips, and more than 50 police 
officers were seriously injured, including 15 officers who 
had to be hospitalized, by violent assaults, and there 
could easily have been dozens or hundreds more wounded 
and killed, a sentiment captured by Senator Lindsey Gra-
ham, who observed that ‘‘the mob could have blown the 
building up. They could have killed us all’’; 
Whereas these insurrectionary protests were widely advertised 
and broadly encouraged by President Donald J. Trump, 
who repeatedly urged his millions of followers on Twitter 
and other social media outlets to come to Washington on 
January 6 to ‘‘Stop the Steal’’ of the 2020 Presidential 
election and promised his activist followers that the pro-
test on the Electoral College counting day would be 
‘‘wild’’; 
Whereas President-elect Joseph R. Biden won the 2020 Pres-
idential election with more than 81 million votes and de-
feated President Trump 306–232 in the Electoral Col-
lege, a margin pronounced to be a ‘‘landslide’’ by Presi-
dent Trump when he won by the same Electoral College 
numbers in 2016, but President Trump never accepted 
these election results as legitimate and waged a pro-
tracted campaign of propaganda and coercive pressure in 
the Federal and State courts, in the state legislatures, 
with Secretaries of State, and in Congress to nullify and 
overturn these results and replace them with fraudulent 
and fabricated numbers; 
Whereas President Trump made at least 3 attempts to inter-
vene in the lawful vote counting and certification process 
in Georgia and to coerce officials there into fraudulently 
declaring him the winner of the State’s electoral votes, 
including calls to Georgia Governor Brian Kemp and a

State elections investigator, and an hour-long conversa-
tion with Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger badg-
ering him to ‘‘find 11,780 votes’’ and warning of a ‘‘big 
risk’’ to Raffensperger if he did not intervene favorably 
to guarantee the reelection of President Trump; 
Whereas President Trump appeared with members of his 
staff and family at a celebratory kickoff rally to encour-
age and charge up the rioters and insurrectionists to 
‘‘walk down to the Capitol’’ and ‘‘if you don’t fight like 
hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore’’ on 
Wednesday, January 6, 2021; 
Whereas while violent insurrectionists occupied parts of the 
Capitol, President Trump ignored or rejected repeated 
real-time entreaties from Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Sen-
ate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to appeal to his fol-
lowers to exit the Capitol, and also ignored a tweet from 
Alyssa Farah, his former communications director, say-
ing: ‘‘Condemn this now, @realDonaldTrump—you are 
the only one they will listen to. For our country!’’; 
Whereas photographs, cell phone videos, social media posts, 
and on-the-ground reporting show that numerous violent 
insurrectionists who invaded the Capitol were armed, 
were carrying police grade flex cuffs to detain and hand-
cuff people, used mace, pepper spray, and bear spray 
against United States Capitol Police officers, erected a 
gallows on Capitol grounds to hang ‘‘traitors,’’ vehe-
mently chanted ‘‘Hang Mike Pence!’’ while surrounding 
and roving the Capitol, emphasized that storming the 
Capitol was ‘‘a revolution,’’ brandished the Confederate 
battle flag inside the Capitol, and were found to be in 
possession of Napalm B, while still unidentified culprits 
planted multiple pipe bombs at buildings near the Capitol

complex, another lethally dangerous criminal action that 
succeeded in diverting law enforcement from the Capitol; 
and 
Whereas Donald Trump has demonstrated repeatedly, con-
tinuously, and spectacularly his absolute inability to dis-
charge the most basic and fundamental powers and du-
ties of his office, including most recently the duty to re-
spect the legitimate results of the Presidential election, 
the duty to respect the peaceful transfer of democratic 
power under the Constitution, the duty to participate in 
legally defined transition activities, the duty to protect 
and uphold the Constitution of the United States, includ-
ing the counting of Electoral College votes by Congress, 
the duty to protect the people of the United States and 
their elected representatives against domestic insurrec-
tion, mob rule, and seditious violence, and generally the 
duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed: 
Now, therefore, be it
