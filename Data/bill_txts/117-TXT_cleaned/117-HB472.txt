A BILL 
To reduce the size of the seat of the Government of the 
United States to the area comprised of the principal 
Federal monuments, the White House, the United States 
Capitol, the United States Supreme Court Building, and 
the Federal executive, legislative, and judicial office 
buildings located adjacent to the Mall and the United 
States Capitol, to provide for the retrocession of the 
remaining area of the District of Columbia to the State 
of Maryland, and for other purposes.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘District of Columbia- 
4
Maryland Reunion Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Article I, section 2, clause 1 of the United 
8
States Constitution states that the ‘‘House of Rep-
9
resentatives shall be composed of members chosen 
10
every second year by the people of the several 
11
states.’’. 
12
(2) The Founding Fathers did not consider the 
13
proposed district that would become Washington, 
14
DC, a State under the Constitution, as evidenced 
15
when Alexander Hamilton offered an amendment to 
16
the Constitution during the New York ratification to 
17
provide full congressional representation to Wash-
18
ington, DC, but the convention rejected the amend-
19
ment on July 22, 1788. 
20
(3) Chief Justice Marshall held in Hepburn v. 
21
Ellzey in 1805 that the term ‘‘states’’ in Article I, 
22
section 2, clause 1 of the Constitution does not in-
23
clude Washington, DC, for representation purposes.

(4) Seven Supreme Court Justices affirmed 
1
Chief Justice Marshall’s Hepburn reasoning in Na-
2
tional Mut. Ins. Co. of Dist. of Col. v. Tidewater 
3
Transfer Co. in 1949. 
4
(5) A Democrat-controlled Congress in 1978 at-
5
tempted to amend the Constitution to provide Wash-
6
ington, DC, with full congressional representation. 
7
The Committee on the Judiciary of the House of 
8
Representatives reported the resolution and stated 
9
that granting congressional representation to the 
10
District of Columbia as it is presently constituted 
11
would require a constitutional amendment, because 
12
‘‘statutory action alone will not suffice’’. 
13
(6) Amending the Constitution requires two- 
14
thirds approval by each house of Congress and rati-
15
fication by three-fourths of the States. In 1978, 
16
there was success in obtaining a favorable vote from 
17
two-thirds of both the House and the Senate on a 
18
constitutional amendment to provide Washington, 
19
DC, with full congressional representation, but the 
20
requirement for ratification by three-fourths of the 
21
States could not be obtained. 
22
(7) An alternative to a potentially lengthy and 
23
difficult constitutional amendment process is ceding 
24
Washington, DC, back to Maryland, just as an area

of 31 square miles that was originally ceded by Vir-
1
ginia was returned to that State by Federal legisla-
2
tion in 1847, thereby ensuring that the portion of 
3
Washington, DC, in Virginia would have Senate and 
4
House representation. 
5
(8) In 1847, there was a desire to allow the 
6
District of Columbia land on the west side of the Po-
7
tomac River that was not being used by the Federal 
8
Government to have its own proper representation in 
9
Congress. 
10
(9) Obtaining the desired representation for 
11
this portion of Washington, DC, would have required 
12
a constitutional amendment unless the land were 
13
given back to Virginia. 
14
(10) Instead of trying to pass a constitutional 
15
amendment, Congress in 1847 legislatively ceded 
16
back to Virginia from the District of Columbia the 
17
non-Federal land composed of 31 square miles on 
18
the west side of the Potomac River. 
19
(11) Accordingly, the District of Columbia 
20
would clearly and constitutionally have 2 Senators 
21
and a Representative with full voting rights by 
22
ceding the District of Columbia to Maryland after 
23
Maryland’s acceptance of such retrocession, while 
24
maintaining the exclusive legislative authority and
