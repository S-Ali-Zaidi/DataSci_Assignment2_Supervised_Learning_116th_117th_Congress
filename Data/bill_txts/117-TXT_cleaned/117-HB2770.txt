other individual on board a passenger airplane;

3
pletely exchanged and whether air in certain areas 
4
of the cabin is exchanged more quickly or slowly

7
systems and the respective filtration systems of such

recirculation systems increase or decrease the likeli-

hood of exposure to a pathogen;

the 
extent 
to 
which 
the 
use 
of

preconditioned air during embarkation and disem-
12
barkation changes the likelihood of a passenger’s ex-
13
posure to a pathogen as opposed to the use of air

conditioning packs fed by the auxiliary power unit;

17
of an individual’s exposure to a pathogen on a pas-

sonal air outlets, seating location, load factor, move-
20
ment of cabin crewmembers and passengers through-
21
out the cabin during the flight, embarkation, and
