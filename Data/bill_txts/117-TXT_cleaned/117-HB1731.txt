SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The people of the United States celebrate 
3
cultural and linguistic diversity and seek to prepare 
4
students with skills to succeed in the 21st century. 
5
(2) It is fitting to commend the dedication of 
6
students who have achieved proficiency in multiple 
7
languages and to encourage their peers to follow in 
8
their footsteps. 
9
(3) The congressionally requested Commission 
10
on Language Learning, in its 2017 report ‘‘Amer-
11
ica’s Languages: Investing in Language Education 
12
for the 21st Century’’, notes the pressing national 
13
need for more people of the United States who are 
14
proficient in two or more languages for national se-
15
curity, economic growth, and the fulfillment of the 
16
potential of all people of the United States. 
17
(4) The Commission on Language Learning 
18
also notes the extensive cognitive, educational, and 
19
employment benefits deriving from biliteracy. 
20
(5) Biliteracy in general correlates with higher 
21
graduation rates, higher grade point averages, high-
22
er rates of matriculation into higher education, and 
23
higher earnings for all students, regardless of back-
24
ground.

•HR 1731 IH
(6) The study of America’s languages in ele-
1
mentary and secondary schools should be encouraged 
2
because it contributes to a student’s cognitive devel-
3
opment and to the national economy and security. 
4
(7) Recognition of student achievement in lan-
5
guage proficiency will enable institutions of higher 
6
education and employers to readily recognize and ac-
7
knowledge the valuable expertise of bilingual stu-
8
dents in academia and the workplace. 
9
(8) States such as Utah, Arizona, Washington, 
10
and New Mexico have developed innovative testing 
11
methods for languages, including Native American 
12
languages, where no formal proficiency test currently 
13
exists. 
14
(9) The use of proficiency in a government-rec-
15
ognized official Native American language as the 
16
base language for a Seal of Biliteracy, with pro-
17
ficiency in any additional partner language dem-
18
onstrated through tested proficiency, has been suc-
19
cessfully demonstrated in Hawaii. 
20
(10) Students in every State and every school 
21
should be able to benefit from a Seal of Biliteracy 
22
program.
