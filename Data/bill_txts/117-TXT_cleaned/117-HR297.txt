RESOLUTION 
Honoring the life and legacy of Carl Lutz. 
Whereas Carl Lutz was born on March 30, 1895, in 
Walzenhausen, Switzerland, but moved to the United 
States as a young man; 
Whereas Carl Lutz became a diplomat, eventually serving at 
the Swiss consulate in what was then Mandatory Pal-
estine; 
Whereas, in 1942, Carl Lutz was transferred to Budapest, 
Hungary, where he— 
(1) served as the Swiss vice consul until the end of 
World War II; and 
(2) represented countries that had severed diplo-
matic relations with Hungary because of its German alli-
ance;

Whereas Carl Lutz, upon arrival in Budapest, began to work 
to help Jews receive Swiss diplomatic protection so they 
could flee Nazi persecution; 
Whereas, in 1944, Carl Lutz received permission to issue pro-
tective papers to save 8,000 Jews from deportation, 
which Lutz determined to mean 8,000 families, not 8,000 
individuals; 
Whereas Carl Lutz extended Swiss protection to 76 buildings 
that operated as safe houses for Jewish refugees seeking 
protection, including a department store called the Glass 
House, which served as a refuge for up to 3,000 Jews 
and as a headquarters for the Zionist underground; 
Whereas, in November 1944, Carl Lutz and his wife, Trudi 
Lutz, joined a death march to various concentration 
camps, pulling Jews out of the line to issue as many pro-
tective papers as possible; 
Whereas, at the end of World War II, Carl Lutz and his co-
conspirators, including his wife, his staff, and the Zionist 
underground members, saved over 50,000 Jews, which 
was half of the surviving Jewish population of Budapest; 
and 
Whereas the United States is deeply indebted to Carl Lutz, 
who was responsible for the largest civilian rescue mis-
sion of Jews during World War II: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) honors the life and legacy of Carl Lutz; 
2
(2) recognizes that the heroic effort of Carl 
3
Lutz went above and beyond the call of duty to save 
4
the Hungarian Jews ‘‘condemned to die’’ because he 
5
believed it to be a ‘‘matter of conscience’’; and

est civilian rescue mission of Jews during World
