reduce the risks of child marriages, sex trafficking, 
1
and sexual abuse occurring throughout the world; 
2
(2) major loopholes in Federal law have allowed 
3
up to thousands of minors to be subjected to child 
4
marriages; 
5
(3) under the Immigration and Nationality Act 
6
(8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.)— 
7
(A) a United States citizen child may peti-
8
tion for an immigrant visa for a spouse or 
9
fiance´ living in another country; and 
10
(B) a United States citizen adult may peti-
11
tion for an immigrant visa for a minor spouse 
12
or fiance´ living abroad; 
13
(4) the United States Government has advo-
14
cated for preventing and reducing the occurrence of 
15
child marriages throughout the world; 
16
(5) Congress passed the Violence Against 
17
Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 (Public Law 
18
113–4), which requires the Secretary of State to es-
19
tablish and implement a multiyear strategy—

22

•HR 3214 IH
(6) acknowledges that although the Federal 
1
Government is limited in its ability to address child 
2
marriage within individual States, establishing a 
3
minimum age of 18 years for marriage-based and 
4
fiance´-based immigrant visa petitions is an imme-
5
diate and viable solution for preventing child mar-
6
riage through exploitation of the United States im-
7
migration system; 
8
(7) affirms that child well being is a foremost 
9
priority and consideration when imposing strict age 
10
requirements for visa spousal and fiance´ petitions 
11
within the United States immigration system; and 
12
(8) recognizes that under the current immigra-
13
tion legal framework, individuals may exploit visa 
14
marriage and fiance´ petitions for nefarious purposes, 
15
including— 
16
(A) coercing forced marriages; and 
17
(B) the trafficking and abuse of children.
