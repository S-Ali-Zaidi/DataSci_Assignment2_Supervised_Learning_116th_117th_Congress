wide section of the Mississippi River that is 60 miles 
southeast of the Twin Cities; 
Whereas a Sports Illustrated article dated August 10, 1987, 
also credited Mr. Samuelson as ‘‘The Father of Water-
skiing’’ and described him as a thrill-seeker who spent 
much of his time on Lake Pepin; and 
Whereas waterskiing is a hugely popular sport enjoyed by 
millions world-wide and those millions of people have 
Ralph Samuelson to thank: Now, therefore, be it
