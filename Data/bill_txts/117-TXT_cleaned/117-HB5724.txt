This Act may be cited as the ‘‘White House Con-
4

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds that— 
7
(1) hunger and food and nutrition insecurity 
8
are conditions that can be solved;

(2) access to healthy food and good nutrition 
1
should be a fundamental priority of each individual 
2
who lives in a State; 
3
(3) more than 50 years have passed since the 
4
United States convened a White House conference to 
5
comprehensively address the issues of food, hunger, 
6
health, and nutrition in the United States; 
7
(4) more than 38,000,000 individuals live in 
8
households that face food insecurity, 12,600,000 of 
9
whom are children and 5,000,000 of whom are sen-
10
iors and persons with disabilities or critical illnesses; 
11
(5)(A) because of the COVID–19 pandemic, 
12
more 
than 
42,000,000 
individuals, 
including 
13
13,000,000 children, are projected to experience 
14
food insecurity; and 
15
(B) diet-related diseases greatly worsen out-
16
comes from COVID–19, contributing to nearly 2⁄3 of 
17
all COVID–19 hospitalizations in the United States; 
18
(6)(A) the COVID–19 pandemic has disrupted 
19
global and local food supply chains, identifying the 
20
fragility and importance of the food system as a na-
21
tional security issue and making clear that a diverse 
22
local and regional food system is essential to the re-
23
silience of the United States; and

•HR 5724 IH
(B) that issue has become entangled with the 
1
issues of hunger and food and nutrition insecurity; 
2
(7)(A) the burdens of food insecurity are not 
3
distributed equally, as the burdens remain higher 
4
among racial and ethnic minority groups, in rural 
5
areas, and in the south and southeast; 
6
(B) households headed by Blacks and Hispanics 
7
face higher rates of food insecurity, at a rate of 21.2 
8
percent and 16.2 percent, respectively, while the na-
9
tional average is 11.1 percent; and 
10
(C) the geographic distributions of food insecu-
11
rity remain a serious concern, as rural communities 
12
represent 87 percent of the counties in the United 
13
States with the highest rates of overall food insecu-
14
rity; 
15
(8)(A) nutrition insecurity and diet-related 
16
chronic diseases disproportionately affect racial and 
17
ethnic minority groups and low-income, rural, and 
18
other underserved populations in the United States; 
19
and 
20
(B) in just over 10 years, type 2 diabetes rates 
21
have doubled for African-American children and in-
22
creased 50 percent for Native-American children and 
23
Hispanic children between 10 and 19 years old;

(9) conservative cost estimates show that the 
1
true cost of hunger and illness related to hunger and 
2
food and nutrition insecurity in the United States is 
3
at least $160,000,000,000 per year with respect to 
4
direct medical costs, most of which is paid by Medi-
5
care and Medicaid, an amount that exceeds the an-
6
nual budget of the Department of Agriculture; 
7
(10) hyper-consolidation in the food industry 
8
has led to a dramatic decline in the farmer’s share 
9
of the food dollar, fewer choices for consumers, and 
10
economic insecurity for rural communities, many of 
11
which are now considered food deserts; 
12
(11)(A) better food and nutrition can save the 
13
United States billions of dollars in health care costs 
14
by preventing or delaying the progression to late- 
15
stage disease for tens of millions of individuals who 
16
live in a State and have chronic diseases; 
17
(B) the adverse social, physical, and psycho-
18
logical outcomes associated with food and nutrition 
19
insecurity are well documented, particularly in 
20
households with children, including higher rates of 
21
diabetes and hypertension, self-reported fair or poor 
22
health, maternal depression, behavioral problems 
23
and developmental delays in early life, and poor aca-
24
demic achievement;

(C) those outcomes are not only detrimental to 
1
the health and well-being of individual children and 
2
families, but also negatively impact broader society; 
3
and 
4
(D) based on a combination of lower worker 
5
productivity, higher costs of public education, great-
6
er health care costs, and the cost associated with 
7
emergency food distribution, the economic burden 
8
associated with food insecurity has been estimated to 
9
be over $178,930,000,000 annually; and 
10
(12) a national discussion of the root causes 
11
and social determinants of hunger and food and nu-
12
trition insecurity, as well as identification of solu-
13
tions to those epidemics, can lead to action to imple-
14
ment those solutions and to end hunger in the 
15
United States.
