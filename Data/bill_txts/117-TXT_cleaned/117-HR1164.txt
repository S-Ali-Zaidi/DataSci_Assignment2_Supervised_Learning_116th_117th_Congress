been victims of physical violence rooted in political dis-
agreement; 
Whereas, on June 8, 2022, Nicholas Roske went to the home 
of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh with a suit-
case and backpack containing a black tactical chest rig 
and tactical knife, a Glock 17 pistol with two magazines 
and ammunition, pepper spray, zip ties, a hammer, a 
screwdriver, nail punch, crow bar, pistol light, duct tape, 
and other items; 
Whereas, on June 8, 2022, Nicholas Roske was arrested after 
telling a call taker at the Montgomery County Emergency 
Communications Center that he came to Maryland from 
California to kill Justice Brett Kavanaugh; 
Whereas Nicholas Roske has been charged with attempt to 
murder a United States Supreme Court Justice; 
Whereas Senator Schumer’s comments may have contributed 
to Nicholas Roske’s desire to kill Justice Kavanaugh; 
Whereas Senator Schumer is the leader of his conference in 
the Senate and is held to a higher standard for his col-
leagues and the American people to follow; 
Whereas Senator Schumer’s comments are in direct conflict 
with the constitutional process by which cases are delib-
erated and verdicts are issued by the Supreme Court; and

public unrest: Now, therefore, be it
