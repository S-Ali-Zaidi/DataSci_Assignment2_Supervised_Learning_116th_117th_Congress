RESOLUTION 
Calling on the Government of the Republic of Rwanda to 
release Paul Rusesabagina on humanitarian grounds. 
Whereas, in August 2020, Rwandan political activist Paul 
Rusesabagina, a United States lawful permanent resident 
and a Presidential Medal of Freedom Honoree, was 
extrajudicially transferred from Texas to Kigali, Rwanda, 
by way of the United Arab Emirates, and subjected to an 
enforced disappearance for three days before the Govern-
ment of the Republic of Rwanda acknowledged his deten-
tion, during which time he was reportedly tortured; 
Whereas, in December 2020, more than 36 Members of Con-
gress wrote to President Paul Kagame to urge him to re-
turn Paul Rusesabagina to the United States and ex-
pressed grave concern with the manner in which the Gov-

ernment of Rwanda extrajudicially transferred Mr. 
Rusesabagina from the United Arab Emirates to Rwanda 
and then immediately placed him in solitary confinement 
and charged him with multiple crimes; 
Whereas, on February 11, 2021, the European Parliament 
adopted a resolution on ‘‘Rwanda, the case of Paul 
Rusesabagina’’, which in part ‘‘[e]xpresses deep concern 
about the violations of Mr Rusesabagina’s rights; urges 
the Rwandan authorities to allow Mr Rusesabagina to 
undergo a fair and public hearing by a competent, inde-
pendent and impartial tribunal applying international 
human rights standards . . .’’; 
Whereas the American Bar Association’s Center for Human 
Rights’

report 
‘‘The 
Case 
of 
Paul 
Rusesabagina’’ concluded that, ‘‘it is clear that Mr. 
Rusesabagina’s fair trial rights – in particular his right 
to confidential communication, his right to the presump-
tion of innocence, and his right to prepare his defense – 
have been violated, potentially to the irreparable preju-
dice of the defense, calling into question the fairness of 
any potential convicting verdict’’; 
Whereas, on September 20, 2021, the High Court of Rwanda 
convicted Paul Rusesabagina of terrorism-related offences 
and he was sentenced to 25 years in prison; 
Whereas United States Department of State Spokesman Ned 
Price announced on September 20, 2021, that the United 
States Government is ‘‘concerned by the Government of 
Rwanda’s conviction of U.S. lawful permanent resident 
Paul Rusesabagina’’ and stated that the ‘‘reported lack 
of fair trial guarantees calls into question the fairness of 
the verdict’’;
