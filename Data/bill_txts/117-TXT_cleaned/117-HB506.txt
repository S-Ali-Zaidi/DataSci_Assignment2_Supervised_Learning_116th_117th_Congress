SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
1
It is the sense of Congress that— 
2
(1) the removal of criminal aliens promotes 
3
public safety, national security, border security, and 
4
the integrity of the immigration system; 
5
(2) detainers have proven to be a useful law en-
6
forcement tool that serve to expedite and improve 
7
the efficiency of the removal process by enabling the 
8
Department of Homeland Security to assume cus-
9
tody in a timely manner of aliens in the custody of 
10
Federal, State, tribal, or local law enforcement agen-
11
cies; and 
12
(3) several States and localities have limited 
13
their cooperation with immigration detainers issued 
14
by the Department of Homeland Security and lim-
15
ited the Department of Homeland Security’s access 
16
to information regarding the release of criminal 
17
aliens in their custody, which has resulted in the re-
18
lease of dangerous criminal aliens into local commu-
19
nities.

4
State, tribal, and local law enforcement agencies 
5
with regard to immigration enforcement and infor-
6
mation sharing; and 
7
(3) to limit the burden on Federal, State, tribal,

with the Department of Homeland Security in its 
10
prioritized immigration enforcement.
