RESOLUTION 
Recognizing September 22nd, 2022, as the Order of the 
Sons and Daughters of Italy in America, Colombo-Stella 
Lodge 1149 Day. 
Whereas the Order of the Sons and Daughters of Italy in 
America is the first and oldest Italian fraternal organiza-
tion in the United States, established in 1905; 
Whereas Alfonso Cubicciotti, a member, who was also presi-
dent of many Italian organizations, immigrated west to 
start the first lodge in California; 
Whereas Cubicciotti was known because he spoke against the 
Dillingham bill, which called for Italian immigrants to 
pass a literacy test, be measured for physical desirability, 
and any health restrictions or ‘‘defects’’ that could force 
their return to Italy;

Whereas a charter was signed on September 22, 1922, for 
the first lodge in California located in Fresno, the geo-
graphic center of California and one of the richest agri-
cultural zones in our Nation; 
Whereas the Sons of Italy Colombo Lodge 1149’s main pur-
pose was to give Italians a place to gather safely, to so-
cialize and to help assimilate in the United States; 
Whereas they were also very involved in Italian-American 
causes and worked to end bigotry and discrimination; 
Whereas, when established in 1922, the Sons of Italy 
Colombo Lodge was a ‘‘men’s only’’ club; 
Whereas the women’s auxiliary, the Stella Lodge, was estab-
lished in 1928 and when the men served in the military 
during World War II, membership was depleted, and the 
women helped to save the Colombo Lodge; 
Whereas the two merged and became what is now known as 
Colombo-Stella Lodge 1149; 
Whereas since its origin, the Lodge has donated to many 
nonprofit and charitable business organizations including 
war relief, the restoration of the Statue of Liberty, Ellis 
Island, earthquake relief, children’s orphanages, and 
Cooley’s anemia; and 
Whereas, on September 22, 2022, the Order of the Sons and 
Daughters of Italy in America, Colombo-Stella Lodge 
1149, will celebrate 100 years of service to the Fresno 
community, remaining the first and oldest Italian organi-
zation in California: Now, therefore, be it
