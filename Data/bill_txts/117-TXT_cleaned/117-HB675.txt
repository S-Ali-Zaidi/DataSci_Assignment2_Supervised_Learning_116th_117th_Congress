2
for any person to sell or offer for sale a good or service

at a price that—

14

15
service was sold or offered for sale by such person— 
16
(A) during the 90-day period immediately 
17
preceding January 31, 2020; or

service was readily obtainable from other similarly 
1
situated competing sellers before January 31, 2020.

(3) Whether such price reasonably reflects addi-
3
tional costs, not within the control of such person, 
4
that were paid, incurred, or reasonably anticipated 
5
by such person, or reasonably reflects the profit-
6
ability of forgone sales or additional risks taken by 
7
such person, to produce, distribute, obtain, or sell

such good or service under the circumstances.
