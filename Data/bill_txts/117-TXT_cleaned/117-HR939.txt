Whereas every child has the right to an education that helps 
them reach their full potential and to attend schools that 
offer a high-quality educational experience; 
Whereas stable, equitable, predictable, and adequate funding 
for great public schools for every student in the United 
States is necessary to ensure that students have inviting

as well as well-prepared and supported educators; 
Whereas educators include teachers, paraprofessionals, and 
principals who provide a well-rounded and complete cur-
riculum and create joy in learning; 
Whereas the Nation’s school buildings should have class sizes 
small enough to allow students to receive one-on-one at-
tention and to access support services such as health 
care, nutrition, and after-school programs when needed; 
Whereas students, teachers, and professionals make the Na-
tion’s public schools vital components of the community; 
Whereas parents and communities are working hard to im-
prove educational outcomes for children across the coun-
try; and 
Whereas the week of February 21 through February 25, 
2022, would be an appropriate period to designate as 
‘‘Public Schools Week’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives supports
