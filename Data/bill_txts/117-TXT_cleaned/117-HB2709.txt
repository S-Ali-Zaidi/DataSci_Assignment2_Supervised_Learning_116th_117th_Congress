A BILL 
To amend title 10, United States Code, to ensure that mem-
bers of the Armed Forces and their families have access 
to the contraception they need in order to promote the 
health and readiness of all members of the Armed 
Forces, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Access to Contracep-
4
tion for Servicemembers and Dependents Act of 2021’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Women are serving in the Armed Forces at 
8
increasing rates, playing a critical role in the na-
9
tional security of the United States. Women com-
10
prise more than 18 percent of members of the 
11
Armed Forces, and as of fiscal year 2019, over 
12
390,000 women serve on active duty in the Armed 
13
Forces or in the reserve components. An estimated 
14
several thousand transgender men also serve on ac-
15
tive duty in the Armed Forces and in the reserve 
16
components, in addition to non-binary members and 
17
those who identify with a different gender. 
18
(2) Ninety-five percent of women serving in the 
19
Armed Forces are of reproductive age and as of 
20

2019, more than 700,000 female spouses and de-
1
pendents of members of the Armed Forces on active 
2
duty are of reproductive age. 
3
(3) The TRICARE program covered more than 
4
1,570,000 women of reproductive age in 2019, in-
5
cluding spouses and dependents of members of the 
6
Armed Forces on active duty. Additionally, thou-
7
sands of transgender dependents of members of the 
8
Armed Forces are covered by TRICARE. 
9
(4) The right to access contraception is ground-
10
ed in the principle that contraception and the ability 
11
to determine if and when to have children are inex-
12
tricably tied to one’s wellbeing, equality, and ability 
13
to determine the course of one’s life. These protec-
14
tions have helped access to contraception become a 
15
driving force in improving the health and financial 
16
security of individuals and their families. 
17
(5) Access to contraception is critical to the 
18
health of every individual capable of becoming preg-
19
nant. This Act is intended to apply to all individuals 
20
with the capacity for pregnancy, including cisgender 
21
women, transgender men, non-binary individuals, 
22
those who identify with a different gender, and oth-
23
ers.

•HR 2709 IH
(6) Studies have shown that when cost barriers 
1
to the full range of methods of contraception are 
2
eliminated, patients are more likely to use the con-
3
traceptive method that meets their needs, and there-
4
fore use contraception correctly and more consist-
5
ently, reducing the risk of unintended pregnancy. 
6
(7) Under the TRICARE program, members of 
7
the Armed Forces on active duty have full coverage 
8
of all prescription drugs, including contraception, 
9
without cost-sharing requirements, in line with the 
10
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public 
11
Law 111–148), which requires coverage of all con-
12
traceptive methods approved by the Food and Drug 
13
Administration for women and related services and 
14
education and counseling. However, members not on 
15
active duty and dependents of members do not have 
16
similar coverage of all methods of contraception ap-
17
proved by the Food and Drug Administration with-
18
out cost-sharing when they obtain the contraceptive 
19
outside of a military medical treatment facility. 
20
(8) In order to fill gaps in coverage and access 
21
to preventive care critical for women’s health, the 
22
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public 
23
Law 111–148) requires all non-grandfathered indi-
24
vidual and group health plans to cover without cost- 
25

•HR 2709 IH
sharing preventive services, including a set of evi-
1
dence-based preventive services for women supported 
2
by the Health Resources and Services Administra-
3
tion of the Department of Health and Human Serv-
4
ices. These women’s preventive services include the 
5
full range of female-controlled contraceptive meth-
6
ods, effective family planning practices, and steriliza-
7
tion procedures, approved by the Food and Drug 
8
Administration. The Health Resources and Services 
9
Administration has affirmed that contraceptive care 
10
includes contraceptive counseling, initiation of con-
11
traceptive use, and follow-up care (such as manage-
12
ment, evaluation, and changes to and removal or dis-
13
continuation of the contraceptive method). 
14
(9) The Defense Advisory Committee on 
15
Women in the Services has recommended that all 
16
the Armed Forces, to the extent that they have not 
17
already, implement initiatives that inform members 
18
of the Armed Forces of the importance of family 
19
planning, educate them on methods of contraception, 
20
and make various methods of contraception avail-
21
able, based on the finding that family planning can 
22
increase the overall readiness and quality of life of 
23
all members of the Armed Forces.

(10) The military departments received more 
1
than 7,800 reports of sexual assaults involving mem-
2
bers of the Armed Forces as victims or subjects dur-
3
ing fiscal year 2019. Through regulations, the De-
4
partment of Defense already supports a policy of en-
5
suring that members of the Armed Forces who are 
6
sexually assaulted have access to emergency contra-
7
ception, and the initiation of contraception if desired 
8
and medically appropriate.
