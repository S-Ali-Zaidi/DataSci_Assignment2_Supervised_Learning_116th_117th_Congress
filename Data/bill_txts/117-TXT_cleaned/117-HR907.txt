RESOLUTION 
Reaffirming our commitment to support progress toward 
transparency, accountable institutions, and other tenets 
of good governance in the Republic of Liberia as it 
approaches the bicentennial of the arrival of the first 
free Black Americans to Providence Island, Liberia. 
Whereas, on January 7, 1822, free Black Americans arrived 
in present-day Liberia through the efforts of the Amer-
ican Society for Colonizing the Free People of Color of 
the United States, also known as the American Coloniza-
tion Society, established in 1816 to fund the passage of 
free Black Americans to West Africa; 
Whereas, in 1847, the free Black Americans declared inde-
pendence from the American Colonization Society and

founded the Republic of Liberia, the first independent Af-
rican republic, and established diplomatic relations with 
the United States in 1864 that have endured for more 
than 150 years; 
Whereas United States interests in Liberia’s natural re-
sources and Liberia’s strategic location in West Africa re-
sulted in enhanced bilateral cooperation with the United 
States and prompted the United States and Liberia to 
sign a defense cooperation agreement in 1942 and subse-
quent agreements that facilitated strategic infrastructure 
development in Monrovia and enhanced United States-Li-
beria defense cooperation thereafter; 
Whereas, in 1944, Liberia declared war against Germany and 
Japan, further reinforcing Liberia’s commitment to sup-
port the United States and the Allies in World War II; 
Whereas, from 1980 to 2003, Liberia’s democracy was under-
mined by a coup d’e´tat, corruption, mass atrocities such 
as rape, torture, and forced disappearances, and two civil 
wars that left at least 250,000 people dead, tens of thou-
sands maimed, hundreds of thousands displaced, and 
thousands of former child soldiers seeking rehabilitation 
and reintegration for physical and mental trauma; 
Whereas Liberia, with United States support for democracy, 
governance, and anticorruption initiatives, emerged from 
decades of civil war in 2003 and worked to rehabilitate 
the democratic process through successive free and fair 
elections ever since; 
Whereas, in 2016, the United Nations Security Council voted 
to end sanctions and an arms embargo on Liberia, citing 
substantial progress on postconflict stabilization;

Whereas the United States acknowledges ongoing efforts to 
address government corruption and other critical reforms 
in Liberia and will continue to work with the Liberian 
Government to advance the objectives of the Liberian 
Anti-Corruption Commission and other anticorruption 
agencies and goals underpinning Liberia’s participation 
in the Summit for Democracies in December 2021; 
Whereas the United States remains the largest and longest 
bilateral donor to the Republic of Liberia, allocating more 
than $3,000,000,000 in multiagency assistance since 
2003 to support stabilization, economic recovery, develop-
ment, and global health, including support for Liberia’s 
response to the 2014–2016 Ebola outbreak and the ongo-
ing COVID–19 pandemic, during which the United 
States has worked with partners to donate nearly 
900,000 COVID–19 vaccine doses; 
Whereas the United States has demonstrated its commitment 
to bolster bilateral relations through continued sessions 
of the U.S.-Liberia Partnership Dialogue, Liberia’s ongo-
ing participation in the House Democracy Partnership, 
and related initiatives; 
Whereas Liberia remains a beneficiary of United States trade 
preferences through the African Growth and Opportunity 
Act and the 2007 Trade and Investment Framework 
Agreement, both of which affirm the importance of open 
and diversified trade and investment between the United 
States and Liberia; and 
Whereas the Liberian people and the Liberian diaspora have 
contributed significantly to the United States and Liberia 
and reaffirm the longstanding transatlantic ties between 
the two nations, which will be underscored by the Repub-
