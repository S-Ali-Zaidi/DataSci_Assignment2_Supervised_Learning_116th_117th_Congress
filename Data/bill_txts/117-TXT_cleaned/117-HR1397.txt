RESOLUTION 
Condemning the Government of Iran’s torture and murder 
of Mahsa Amini and its crackdown on protesters seeking 
basic human rights, and supporting the protesters in 
their demands for freedom. 
Whereas the 1979 revolution led to the establishment of an 
Islamic Republic based on a system of Sharia law, which 
particularly discriminates heavily against women; 
Whereas the Iranian regime, both in law and practice, con-
tinues to rule by violence and repression, in sharp con-
trast with the principles outlined in the Universal Dec-
laration of Human Rights and the International Cov-
enant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Iran re-
mains party;

Whereas Iran’s discriminatory legal code established a strict 
dress code that requires all women to wear a hijab in 
public; 
Whereas Article 638 of the Iranian Islamic Penal Code 
states: ‘‘Anyone in public places and roads who openly 
commits a sinful act, in addition to the punishment pro-
vided for the act, shall be sentenced to two months’ im-
prisonment or up to 74 lashes.’’; 
Whereas Iran’s so-called ‘‘Morality Police’’, a component of 
Iran’s Law Enforcement Forces (LEF), is responsible for 
enforcement of Iran’s Sharia law; 
Whereas, on September 13, 2022, Iran’s so-called ‘‘Morality 
Police’’ arrested 22-year-old Mahsa Amini for allegedly 
wearing a hijab improperly and sent her to a regime-run 
‘‘reeducation center’’; 
Whereas after Mahsa Amini was arrested and taken to police 
headquarters, she was transferred to the hospital in a 
coma and died 3 days later from internal injuries; 
Whereas the LEF claims that Mahsa Amini died from a 
heart ailment, though her family says she did not suffer 
from any pre-existing health conditions, and the LEF re-
fused to let Mahsa Amini’s father see her body; 
Whereas the LEF denies accusations of wrongful death and 
of torture of Mahsa Amini; 
Whereas, on September 17, 2022, thousands of peaceful pro-
testers took to the streets to demand accountability for 
Mahsa Amini’s wrongful death and Iran’s discrimination 
against women; 
Whereas during these peaceful protests, Iranian women 
burned their hijabs and cut their hair to protest manda-

tory veiling and the Iranian regime’s longstanding dis-
crimination against women; 
Whereas, on September 17, 2022, Iranian security forces, in-
cluding the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) 
unlawfully fired on peaceful protesters, and killed women, 
teenagers, and men; 
Whereas, since September 17, 2022, Iranian security forces 
continue violently cracking down and killing protesters; 
Whereas, on September 26, 2022, Iranian state media re-
ported 41 people killed in the protests, while other re-
ports suggest the number of dead to be several times 
higher; and 
Whereas, on September 22, 2022, the Department of the 
Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) des-
ignated the so-called ‘‘Morality Police’’ and 7 senior secu-
rity and law enforcement officials, responsible for the use 
of repressive and violent tactics against peaceful protests
