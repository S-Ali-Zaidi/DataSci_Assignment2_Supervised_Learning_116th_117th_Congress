A BILL 
To provide that Federal funds may not be made available 
to lawless jurisdictions, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Lawless Cities Ac-

Congress finds the following:

•HR 3217 IH
(1) It is the policy and purpose of the United 
1
States Government to protect the lives and property 
2
of all people in the United States from unlawful acts 
3
of violence and destruction. Without law and order, 
4
democracy cannot function, Americans cannot exer-
5
cise their rights to peaceful expression, assembly, 
6
and protest, property is destroyed, and innocent citi-
7
zens are injured or killed. 
8
(2) Unfortunately, lawlessness has beset some 
9
of our States and cities. Over the past year, several 
10
State and local governments have contributed to the 
11
violence and destruction in their jurisdictions by fail-
12
ing to enforce the law, disempowering and signifi-
13
cantly defunding their police departments, and re-
14
fusing to accept offers of Federal law enforcement 
15
assistance amidst widespread, sustained violence. As 
16
a result of these State and local government policies, 
17
acts of violence and destruction have skyrocketed 
18
and continue unabated in many of America’s cities. 
19
(3) By shirking their responsibility to carry out 
20
law and order, lawless jurisdictions enabled violent 
21
protestors and rioters to inflict well over $1 billion 
22
in property damage across the United States. Fed-
23
eral and State buildings, businesses, and infrastruc-
24
ture were indiscriminately destroyed by arsonists,

vandals, and looters—harming their owners and tax-
1
payers—who ultimately bear the costs of unchecked 
2
anarchy in American cities. 
3
(4) The failure of cities to enforce the rule of 
4
law has severe consequences and costs lives. In 
5
2020, homicides in major American cities sky-
6
rocketed by 33 percent, a trend that continued into 
7
the first quarter of 2021. In certain cities such as 
8
Portland and Minneapolis, the surge in death and 
9
destruction is even starker, with homicides increas-
10
ing by 733 percent in Portland and 82 percent in 
11
Minneapolis. The Federal government cannot sit idly 
12
by as property is damaged and citizens are mur-
13
dered in lawless jurisdictions. 
14
(5) After being continually demeaned by radical 
15
activists and politicians, having police funding 
16
slashed, being disempowered from enforcing the rule 
17
of law, and witnessing their cities deteriorate into 
18
lawless zones, our dedicated law enforcement per-
19
sonnel are demoralized and leaving the force in 
20
record numbers. In 2020, the New York Police De-
21
partment saw 5,300 personnel leave the department, 
22
a 75 percent increase from the previous year. The 
23
Minneapolis Police Department saw 105 officers 
24
leave the department in 2020, more than double 
25

their average yearly attrition rate. Compounding the 
1
challenge of mass retirements and an inordinate 
2
number of law enforcement personnel on leaves of 
3
absence, police departments are facing unprece-
4
dented recruitment challenges, leaving departments 
5
ill-equipped to handle the dramatic rise in violent 
6
crime. 
7
(6) The Federal Government provides States 
8
and localities with hundreds of billions of dollars 
9
every year, which fund a wide array of programs, 
10
such as housing, public transportation, job training, 
11
and social services. These funds have been collected 
12
from American taxpayers who entrusted their money 
13
to the Federal Government to serve our communities 
14
and our citizens. 
15
(7) The Federal Government should not allow 
16
taxpayer dollars to fund jurisdictions that fail to en-
17
force the rule of law and protect their residents. To 
18
ensure that Federal funds are neither unduly wasted 
19
nor spent in a manner that directly violates our Gov-
20
ernment’s promise to protect life, liberty, and prop-
21
erty, it is imperative that the Federal Government 
22
ensure Federal funds and grants do not go to juris-
23
dictions that permit anarchy, violence, and destruc-
24
tion in America’s cities. This is critical to ensure 
25

that Federal funds are used effectively, and to safe-

guard taxpayer dollars entrusted to the Federal Gov-
2
ernment for the benefit of the American people.

SEC. 3. NO FEDERAL FUNDS FOR LAWLESS JURISDICTIONS.

(a) IN GENERAL.—No Federal funds may be made 
5
available to a jurisdiction that the Attorney General deter-
6
mines is a lawless jurisdiction. 
7
(b) ATTORNEY GENERAL DETERMINATIONS.—Not 
8
later than 30 days after the date of enactment of this Act, 
9
and not less than quarterly thereafter, the Attorney Gen-
10
eral shall make determinations on which jurisdictions are 
11
lawless jurisdictions, and shall make such determinations, 
12
and an explanation of each determination, publicly avail-
13
able. 
14
(c) REINSTATEMENT OF FEDERAL FUNDS.—A juris-
15
diction that the Attorney General determines is a lawless 
16
jurisdiction may begin receiving Federal funds on the later 
17
of— 
18
(1) 180 days after the date on which the Attor-
19
ney General first determines that the jurisdiction is 
20
lawless; or 
21
(2) the date on which the Attorney General de-
22
termines that the jurisdiction is no longer a lawless 
23
jurisdiction.
