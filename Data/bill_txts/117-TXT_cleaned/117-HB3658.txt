private in the Army during World War I. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. FINDINGS. 
3
Congress finds the following: 
4
(1) Military service is one of the most admired 
5
and respected vocations any one can embark upon 
6
knowing that their commitment is to something far 
7
greater than oneself, and we value such military

service because it is dedicated to upholding, defend-
1
ing, and preserving the constitution. 
2
(2) While historically many were drafted into 
3
service before the military became an all-volunteer 
4
service in 1973, there were still individuals who vol-
5
unteered to serve without being drafted, and people 
6
of all walks of life, including new immigrants, have 
7
sought to demonstrate their love, commitment, and 
8
loyalty to this country by volunteering their lives to 
9
service. 
10
(3) Private Marcelino Serna was one such im-
11
migrant seeking to demonstrate his love, commit-
12
ment, and loyalty to his country; born in Chihuahua, 
13
Mexico, Private Serna is part of a legacy of immi-
14
grant soldiers fighting for the United States, eager 
15
to pursue the American Dream; in 1917, without 
16
hesitation, he volunteered to serve in the U.S. 
17
Armed Forces against Germany at the age of 20. 
18
(4) Private Serna was placed in the 355th In-
19
fantry of the 89th Division, and upon his arrival in 
20
France, when it was discovered that he was not a 
21
U.S. citizen, he was given the option to return home, 
22
however, Private Serna made the valiant decision to 
23
serve the United States, his adoptive home.

(5) In recognition of his courageous actions, 
1
Private Serna became the most decorated World 
2
War I veteran in Texas, with awards from the 
3
United States, France, Italy and the United King-
4
dom, which include: the World War I Victory Medal, 
5
two Purple Hearts, the French Medaille Militaire, 
6
two French Croix de Guerre, a French Medaille 
7
commemorative, the British War Medal, the Italian 
8
Croce al Merito di Guerra, the French Verdun, and 
9
the St. Mihiel Medals, as well as being posthumously 
10
awarded Texas’ Lone Star Medal of Valor in 2016. 
11
(6) The aforementioned awards recognize Pri-
12
vate Serna’s demonstrated bravery and remarkable 
13
service to his country in World War I, during which 
14
time, as detailed in the military’s official citation for 
15
his receipt of the Distinguished Service Cross and in 
16
the Texas Handbook Online, Private Serna single-
17
handedly fought, killed, and captured enemy fighters 
18
in the French theater. 
19
(7) White contemporaries of Private Serna who 
20
engaged in similar courageous acts during World 
21
War I have been rightfully recognized for their valor 
22
with the Medal of Honor; however Private Serna was 
23
reportedly passed over for the Medal of Honor be-

cause he did not know enough English to be pro-

moted. 
2
(8) On May 7, 2021, recognizing that acts of 
3
valor performed by minority service members like 
4
Private Serna have gone unrecognized, a bipartisan 
5
Texas State House and Senate Committee voted to 
6
unanimously award Private Serna the Texas Legisla-
7
tive Medal of Honor. 
8
(9) For his conspicuous gallantry, unwavering 
9
commitment, and heroic actions above and beyond 
10
the call of duty to the United States of America, 
11
Private Marcelino Serna has long earned the Medal 
12
of Honor, an award that would allow his descend-
13
ants, fellow Texans, and Americans everywhere to 
14
recognize his heroic deeds.
