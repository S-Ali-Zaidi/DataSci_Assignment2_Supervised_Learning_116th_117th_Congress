dent of the United States, is impeached for high crimes

peachment be exhibited to the Senate:

Article of impeachment exhibited by the House of

Representatives of the United States of America in the

ARTICLE I 
3
4
The Constitution provides that the House of Rep-
5
resentatives ‘‘shall have the sole Power of Impeachment’’ 
6
and that the President ‘‘shall be removed from Office on 
7
Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or 
8
other high Crimes and Misdemeanors’’. In his conduct of 
9
the office of the President of the United States—and in 
10
violation of his constitutional oath faithfully to execute the 
11
office of President of the United States and, to the best 
12
of his ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitu-
13
tion of the United States, and in violation of his constitu-
14
tional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully exe-
15
cuted—Joseph Robinette Biden, Jr., has abused the pow-
16
ers of the Presidency, in that: 
17
Using the powers of his high office, President Biden 
18
colluded with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani on a phone 
19
call on July 23, 2021, to mislead the American people and 
20
our Nation’s allies about the status of the war in Afghani-
21
stan. In the transcript of the call, he explicitly stated, 
22
‘‘. . . as you know and I need not tell you the perception 
23
around the world and in parts of Afghanistan, I believe, 
24
is that things aren’t going well in terms of the fight

against the Taliban. And there’s a need, whether it is true 
1
or not, there is a need to project a different picture.’’. 
2
His action to falsely portray the progress in the fight 
3
against the Taliban directly undermined our national secu-
4
rity, the safety of our men and women in uniform, our 
5
allies, and the Afghan people. Furthermore, this false nar-
6
rative led to the hasty and poorly planned withdrawal of 
7
United States forces from Afghanistan that resulted in the 
8
death of 13 servicemembers and wounding 18 servicemem-
9
bers in the attack at the Kabul airport on August 26, 
10
2021, and the stranding of an estimated 100–200 Ameri-
11
cans in the Taliban-controlled country. 
12
In all of this, President Biden abused the powers of 
13
the Presidency by perpetuating a false perception that the 
14
Afghan security forces were winning the war against the 
15
Taliban in an effort to manipulate the American people 
16
to support his foreign policy objectives and raise his polit-
17
ical capital. 
18
Wherefore, President Biden, by such conduct, has 
19
demonstrated that he is a threat to national security and 
20
the Constitution if allowed to remain in office, and has 
21
acted in a manner grossly incompatible with self-govern-
22
ance and the rule of law. President Biden thus warrants 
23
impeachment and trial, removal from office, and disquali-
