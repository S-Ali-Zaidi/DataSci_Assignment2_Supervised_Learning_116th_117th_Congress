negotiate a bilateral free trade agreement with Taiwan, 
and support Taiwan’s membership in international orga-
nizations. 
Whereas the people of Taiwan have established a free, open, 
pluralistic, and democratic society; 
Whereas the people of Taiwan have conducted 7 democratic 
Presidential elections yielding 3 peaceful transfers of

tionwide referenda, and numerous local elections;

Whereas Taiwan and its outlying islands have never been 
under the jurisdiction or control of the Communist re-
gime in Beijing, which continues to illegitimately claim 
sovereignty over Taiwan and its people; 
Whereas Communist China has weaponized the so-called 
‘‘One China Policy’’ to block Taiwan’s membership and 
full participation in international organizations and 
events ranging from the United Nations and the World 
Health Organization to the Olympic Games; 
Whereas the so-called ‘‘One China Policy’’ is obsolete, does 
not serve the people of Taiwan or the United States, and 
fails to reflect the obvious reality that Taiwan has been 
a sovereign and independent country for over 70 years; 
Whereas Taiwan maintains diplomatic, cultural, and eco-
nomic links with several countries around the world, dem-
onstrating its clear and indisputable independence from 
the People’s Republic of China; 
Whereas Taiwan and the United States maintained normal 
diplomatic relations and a Mutual Defense Treaty until 
President Carter abruptly abandoned both without the 
approval of Congress in 1979; 
Whereas Congress responded by adopting the landmark, bi-
partisan Taiwan Relations Act, codifying in law the basis 
for continued friendly relations between the people of the 
United States and Taiwan; 
Whereas former President Reagan strengthened ties with 
Taiwan by issuing the ‘‘Six Assurances’’, noting that 
‘‘The United States has not altered its position regarding 
sovereignty over Taiwan’’, underscoring that Communist 
Chinese claims of sovereignty over Taiwan have never 
been accepted by the United States;

cles to Taiwan and signed bipartisan legislation allowing 
for expanded high-level exchanges and cooperation be-
tween Taiwanese and American officials; and 
Whereas Taiwan remains a steadfast ally of the United 
States and a responsible and conscientious member of the 
international community: Now, therefore, be it
