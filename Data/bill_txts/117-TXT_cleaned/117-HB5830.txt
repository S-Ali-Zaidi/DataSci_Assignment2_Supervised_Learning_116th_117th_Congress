SEC. 2. INTERNATIONAL TERRESTRIAL CARBON SEQUES-
1
TRATION PROGRAM. 
2
(a) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary of State shall es-
3
tablish a program, to be known as the ‘‘International Ter-
4
restrial Carbon Sequestration Program’’, to provide re-
5
sults-based payments for eligible projects in developing 
6
countries that reduce emissions and enhance carbon se-
7
questration from forests and other terrestrial and coastal 
8
ecosystems. 
9
(b) GOALS.—In carrying out the program established 
10
pursuant to subsection (a), the Secretary shall work with 
11
developing countries and appropriate local partners in de-
12
veloping countries to identify, develop, and implement 
13
projects that— 
14
(1) will help the developing country meet the 
15
emission reductions goals corresponding to that 
16
country’s nationally determined contribution to the 
17
Paris Agreement; and 
18
(2) have the potential to avoid dangerous global 
19
climate change by limiting global warming to well 
20
below 2 degrees Celsius and pursuing efforts to limit 
21
it to 1.5 degrees Celsius (compared to pre-industrial 
22
levels).
