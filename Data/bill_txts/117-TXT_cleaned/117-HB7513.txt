SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Cannabis was federally legal in the United 
3
States until 1937. 
4
(2) Cannabis was federally prohibited to codify 
5
discriminatory practices against minority commu-
6
nities. 
7
(3) Medical cannabis prohibition was estab-
8
lished despite objection from the American Medical 
9
Association. 
10
(4) 37 States and the District of Columbia have 
11
legalized cannabis for medical purposes. 
12
(5) 18 States and the District of Columbia have 
13
legalized cannabis for adult use. 
14
(6) Despite the Federal Government collecting 
15
revenue from the sale of cannabis, individuals are 
16
still criminally persecuted for its use. 
17
(7) Cannabis research, including research on 
18
medical uses, product safety, and impairment stand-
19
ards, is severely hindered and made nearly impos-
20
sible by its schedule 1 classification. 
21
(8) Cannabis should remain an adult product 
22
aside from the physician prescribed treatment of mi-
23
nors. 
24
(9) Cannabis has proven medically beneficial for 
25
patients suffering from pain, cancer, post-traumatic 
26

•HR 7513 IH
stress disorder, seizure disorders, and multiple scle-
1
rosis, among other diseases. 
2
(10) Since 2003, the United States Government 
3
by way of the Department of Health and Human 
4
Services has held a patent for medical cannabis as 
5
an antioxidant and neuroprotectant. 
6
(11) While the United States remains trapped 
7
in antiquated cannabis regulations, other nations 
8
and scientific competitors, including the United 
9
Kingdom, Canada, South Korea, Germany, and 
10
Israel have modified their laws to allow for varying 
11
degrees of cannabis legality and medical research. 
12
SEC. 3. PURPOSE. 
13
The President and Congress shall prepare the Fed-
14
eral Government for an inevitable and prompt end to Fed-
15
eral marihuana prohibition by establishing a commission 
16
to advise on the development of a regulatory framework 
17
with respect to marihuana regulation, including account-
18
ing for the different characteristics of communities, agen-
19
cies, and industries impacted by Federal marihuana prohi-
20
bition. Such regulatory framework shall be modeled after 
21
Federal and State regulatory frameworks with respect to 
22
alcohol.
