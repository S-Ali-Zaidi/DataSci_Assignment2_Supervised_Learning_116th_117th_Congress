‘‘SEC. 403. NATIONAL BIOCHAR RESEARCH NETWORK. 
3
‘‘(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—The Secretary shall estab-
4
lish a national biochar research network of not more than 
5
20 research sites to test the full range of biochar types 
6
across soil types, soil conditions, application methods, and 
7
climatic and agronomic regions to— 
8
‘‘(1) assess the soil carbon sequestration poten-
9
tial of biochar; 
10
‘‘(2) understand how to use biochar produc-
11
tively to contribute to climate mitigation, crop pro-
12
duction, resilience to extreme weather events, eco-
13
system health, and natural resource conservation; 
14
and 
15
‘‘(3) deliver science-based, region-specific, cost- 
16
effective, and practical information to farmers, 
17
ranchers, foresters, land reclamation managers, 
18

‘‘(A) fill critical knowledge gaps and gain 
5
a more complete understanding of the impact of 
6
various types of biochar in varying site condi-

9
in different soils, climates, and other natural 
10
and agronomic conditions;

‘‘(B) provide mechanistic and techno-eco-
12
nomic insights on thermochemical conversion 
13
processes in biochar production and the co-pro-
14
duction of biochar and bioenergy, including 
15
interactions of feedstock properties with reactor

17
tions and properties of biochar, bio-fuels, and 
18
value-added co-products, as well as process effi-

hance 
productivity, 
increase 
profitability,
