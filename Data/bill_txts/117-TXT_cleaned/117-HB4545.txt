(a) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds as follows:

•HR 4545 IH
(1) In a November 15, 2019 article, entitled 
1
‘‘Guardian stole more than $500,000 from elderly 
2
Pinellas man’’, the Tampa Bay Times reported on a 
3
private guardian who allegedly stole over $500,000 
4
from a ward over 11 months. 
5
(2) In an August 2, 2019 article, entitled 
6
‘‘Florida professional guardian Rebecca Fierle: De-
7
voted or dangerous?’’ the Orlando Sentinel reported 
8
on severe cases of alleged adult guardianship fraud 
9
and abuse perpetrated by a private guardian, includ-
10
ing physical neglect, deliberate isolation of wards 
11
from their families, financial exploitation, and using 
12
‘‘do not resuscitate’’ orders without permission. 
13
(3) Private guardians are at risk for financial 
14
conflicts of interest, because a ward’s assets, which 
15
they usually control, are used to pay the guardian 
16
for their services. 
17
(4) Many persons declared incapacitated by a 
18
judge and assigned to a private guardian have not 
19
even appeared in court. 
20
(5) A person deemed incapacitated lacks the 
21
legal authority to petition to have their guardian re-
22
moved or replaced if they believe they are being vic-
23
timized.

(6) Pop icon Britney Spears has unsuccessfully 
1
petitioned the judicial system to remove her father 
2
as her conservator for years. 
3
(7) Despite the fact that Ms. Spears has been 
4
a successful working artist for the past decade, her 
5
repeated requests to have her conservatorship re-
6
moved have been denied. 
7
(8) The 14th Amendment to the Constitution of 
8
the United States protects United States citizens 
9
and residents from being deprived of ‘‘life, liberty, or 
10
property, without due process of law’’. 
11
(9) The allegations in the Orlando Sentinel and 
12
Tampa Bay Times, along with the inability of 
13
Britney Spears to free herself from her father’s con-
14
trol, indicate that State guardianship and con-
15
servatorship systems can deprive a United States 
16
citizen or resident of liberty and property without 
17
due process. 
18
(10) In order to restore due process guaranteed 
19
by the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the 
20
United States, the Federal government must guar-
21
antee that a United States citizen or resident placed 
22
under guardianship or conservatorship retains the 
23
right to petition to have their private guardian or

(b) ESTABLISHMENT OF RIGHT.—An individual who

4
established under State law has the right to— 
5
(1) communicate with a caseworker referred to 
6
in section 2(b)(2), notwithstanding any objection of 
7
the legal guardian of, or conservator for, the indi-
8
vidual; and 
9
(2) petition a court to replace any person who 
10
is a legal guardian of, or conservator for, the indi-
11
vidual and who is not an employee of the State with 
12
a legal guardian or conservator, as the case may be, 
13
who is an employee of the State or who the indi-
14
vidual has designated in a notarized document 
15
signed by the individual to act as such, notwith-
16
standing the terms of the guardianship or con-
17
servatorship, as the case may be, and in any pro-
18
ceeding on such a petition, the petitioner shall not 
19
be required to prove wrongdoing or malfeasance by 
20
the legal guardian or conservator, as the case may 
21
be, as a condition of having the petition granted. 
22
(c) PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION.—An individual who 
23
is the subject of a legal guardianship or conservatorship
