(b) ELIMINATING USE
OF RUSSIAN ENERGY.—It 
10
shall be the goal of the Department of Defense to elimi-
11
nate the use of Russian energy on each main operating 
12
base in the area of responsibility of the United States Eu-
13
ropean Command by not later than five years after the 
14
date of the completion of an installation energy plan for 
15
such base, as required under this section.

(c) INSTALLATION ENERGY PLANS FOR MAIN OPER-
17
ATING BASES.— 
18
(1) IDENTIFICATION OF INSTALLATIONS.—Not 
19
later than June 1, 2023, the Secretary of Defense 
20
shall submit to the congressional defense committees

nology required to improve energy resilience, reduce 
2
demand, strengthen energy conservation, and sup-
3
port mission readiness. 
4
(3) An identification of investments in infra-
5
structure, including microgrids, required to strength-
6
en energy resilience and mitigate risk due to grid 
7
disturbance.

dependence on natural gas. 
12
(5) An assessment of how the requirements and 
13
recommendations included pursuant to paragraphs 
14
(2) through (4) interact with the energy policies of
