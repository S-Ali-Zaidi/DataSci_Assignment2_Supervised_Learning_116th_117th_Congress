SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Countering Chinese 
2
Propaganda Act’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress makes the following findings: 
5
(1) The U.S.-China Economic and Security Re-
6
view Commission has noted that ‘‘China uses what 
7
it calls United Front Work Department of the Chi-
8
nese Communist Party to co-opt and neutralize 
9
sources of potential opposition to the policies and 
10
authority of its ruling Chinese Communist Party 
11
(CCP)’’. 
12
(2) In 1939, Chinese leader Mao Zedong hailed 
13
the United Front Work Department as a ‘‘magic 
14
weapon’’ in the victory of the communist revolution 
15
along with ‘‘armed struggle’’. 
16
(3) Chinese President Xi Jinping has also re-
17
ferred to the United Front Work Department with 
18
those words and given it a key role in what he calls 
19
achieving the People’s Republic of China’s national 
20
rejuvenation. 
21
(4) According to a report by Alex Joske for-
22
merly of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, 
23
the United Front Work Department has doubled in 
24
size since 2015.

(5) The United Front Work Department is in-
1
volved in espionage campaigns, political warfare ef-
2
forts, malign disinformation, utilizing the Chinese 
3
diaspora abroad, and infiltration of educational insti-
4
tutions all with the goal of softening opposition to 
5
the Chinese Communist Party and its policies 
6
throughout the world. 
7
(6) The United Front Work Department played 
8
a seminal role in coordinating multifaceted disinfor-
9
mation campaigns to blame the United States for 
10
the spread of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (com-
11
monly referred to as ‘‘COVID-19’’) pandemic and 
12
coverup China’s negligent response to the pandemic. 
13
(7) An investigation by ProPublica released on 
14
March 26, 2020, found that the United Front Work 
15
Department was connected to a network of fake and 
16
hijacked Twitter accounts that were covertly spread-
17
ing Chinese government propaganda about COVID- 
18
19 to global audiences. 
19
(8) The United Front Work Department uti-
20
lized Chinese diaspora community associations under 
21
its control to purchase personal protective equipment 
22
as the COVID-19 outbreak troubled China from 
23
mid-January 2020 on.

(9) In February 2020, The Global Times, a site 
1
run by the Chinese Communist Party’s People’s 
2
Daily newspaper, alleged that COVID-19 was 
3
brought to China from a United States military base 
4
during the World Games. 
5
(10) As Sheridan Prasso of Bloomberg has re-
6
ported, the United Front Work Department has ac-
7
tively worked to undermine democracy in Hong 
8
Kong under the umbrella of China’s State Council’s 
9
Liaison Office by spreading disinformation and acti-
10
vating a network of media outlets, and diaspora or-
11
ganizations and pressuring businesses in the city to 
12
support China’s national security laws. 
13
(11) The United Front Work Department has 
14
played an integral role in China’s war on religion by 
15
leading efforts to publish a new edition of the Bible 
16
with Chinese Communist characteristics, actively 
17
running internment camps and carrying out anti-re-
18
ligion campaigns against Uyghur Muslims in 
19
Xinjiang and severe religious repression of Bud-
20
dhists in Tibet. 
21
(12) Recognizing the threat of the United 
22
Front Work Department, on December 4, 2020, 
23
former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo imposed 
24
visa restrictions on individuals active in United

4
posed sanctions on You Quan, the head of the
