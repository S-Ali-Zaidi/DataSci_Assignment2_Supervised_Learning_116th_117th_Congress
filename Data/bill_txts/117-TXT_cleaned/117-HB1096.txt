To ensure that the United States diplomatic workforce at 
all levels reflects the diverse composition of the United 
States, and for other purposes.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Represent America 
2
Abroad Act of 2021’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) As the United States becomes more racially 
6
and ethnically diverse, the Department of State and 
7
the United States Agency for International Develop-
8
ment (USAID) must continue to invest in policies to 
9
recruit, retain, and develop the best and brightest 
10
from the full spectrum of American society in order 
11
to be better positioned to advance United States in-
12
terests abroad. 
13
(2) Foreign Service officers are America’s face 
14
to the world. Thus, the workforce must represent the 
15
United States commitment to inclusion and diversity 
16
in order to effectively advance American values on 
17
the world stage. 
18
(3) The Department of State and USAID must 
19
embrace policies that recruit professionals from the 
20
broadest possible pool of talent and retain them in 
21
order to significantly increase diversity in the For-
22
eign Service. Timely action to increase diversity at 
23
the mid-levels is crucial, as it takes approximately 
24
nine years for an entry level Foreign Service officer 
25

•HR 1096 IH
(class 6, 5, 4) to rise to the mid-ranks of the For-
1
eign Service (class 3, 2, or 1). 
2
(4) February and June 2020 reports by the 
3
Government Accountability Office found barriers to 
4
a diverse and inclusive workforce within the ranks of 
5
the Foreign Service, especially at the mid-career and 
6
senior levels. Individuals who are racial or ethnic mi-
7
norities comprise only 24 percent at the Department 
8
of State and 27 percent at USAID. At the executive 
9
level, individuals who are racial or ethnic minorities 
10
comprise only 13 percent at the Department of 
11
State and 17 percent at USAID. This means that 
12
the leadership is the least diverse level within the 
13
Foreign Service. 
14
(5) In the past, Secretaries of State have ac-
15
knowledged the lack of workforce diversity and 
16
pledged to take concrete steps to address the prob-
17
lem. In 2017, then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson 
18
recognized a great diversity gap in the Department 
19
of State and former Secretary of State John Kerry 
20
noted that in order to represent the United States, 
21
the Department of State must have a workforce that 
22
reflects the rich composition of its citizenry. Yet 
23
there has been no concrete plan to address the lack 
24
of diversity at the mid-career and senior levels. 
25

•HR 1096 IH
(6) USAID has previously identified under-rep-
1
resentation of specific groups in its workforce, but 
2
staffing gaps, partly due to a lack of senior leader-
3
ship attention, prevent the agency from adequately 
4
addressing the issue. 
5
(7) Congress authorized the creation of a 3-year 
6
lateral entry pilot project under section 404 of the 
7
Department of State Authorities Act, Fiscal Year 
8
2017 (Public Law 114–323; 130 Stat. 1928) to 
9
bring highly qualified individuals with special skills, 
10
which the Department may lack, into the Foreign 
11
Service at the mid-career level. Such a project would 
12
not only allow the Foreign Service to supplement its 
13
work force with those possessing complementary and 
14
needed skills, but it would also serve as an avenue 
15
to diversify the mid-level and senior ranks of the 
16
Foreign Service. Yet, more than three years later, 
17
the Department has failed to comply with the law.
