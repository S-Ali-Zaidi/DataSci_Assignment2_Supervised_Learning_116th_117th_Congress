Whereas substance use disorder is a chronic disease and rec-
ognizing it as such decreases stigma and acknowledges 
that substance use may be beyond an individual’s control; 
Whereas overdose deaths are preventable, and lives can be 
saved through awareness, prevention, intervention, treat-
ment, and recovery support; 
Whereas overdose deaths claimed more than 81,000 Amer-
ican lives last year, and the COVID–19 pandemic has 
contributed to the acceleration of overdose deaths; 
Whereas communities across the Nation have been pained by 
substance use disorder through the premature loss of 
lives and the stigma associated with drug-related fatali-
ties; and 
Whereas numerous States across the Nation have lowered 
their State flags in recognition of Overdose Awareness 
Day: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives supports 
1
the recognition of Overdose Awareness Day in the United 
2
States of America and that Federal buildings therein be 
3
encouraged to lower their flags to half-staff to support 
4
awareness of overdoses.
