•HR 3789 IH
(1) Based on article I, section 8 of the United 
1
States Constitution, treaties, Federal statutes, and 
2
court decisions, the United States has a unique his-
3
torical and legal relationship with American Indian 
4
and Alaska Native people, which serves as the basis 
5
for the Federal Government’s trust responsibility 
6
and obligations. 
7
(2) There are 574 federally recognized Indian 
8
tribes in the United States, with some 40 percent of 
9
Indian tribes located in the State of Alaska. 
10
(3) Indian tribes have principal responsibility 
11
for lands and people within their jurisdiction. 
12
(4) This responsibility extends to educating 
13
their students and providing adequate educational 
14
facilities in which their students can learn. 
15
(5) Because of this responsibility, Indian 
16
schools should be eligible for the funding available 
17
under this Act. 
18
(6) Elementary and secondary schools all over 
19
the Nation use words and symbols representing their 
20
schools that are offensive to Native Americans. 
21
(7) Nationally, more than 1,900 schools inap-
22
propriately use such offensive names or nicknames. 
23
Often, these names or symbols become mascots and

are used at athletic games for mascot characters, 
1
chants, and other antics. 
2
(8) Although these school communities do not 
3
intend disrespect toward Native Americans, that is 
4
the end result of allowing these offensive terms to 
5
continue in these educational institutions. Therefore, 
6
Federal funding should be available to schools to as-
7
sist them to discontinue use of offensive names and 
8
symbols on equipment and apparel, including team 
9
jerseys, signs, stationery, walls, fields, and gym-
10
nasium floors.
