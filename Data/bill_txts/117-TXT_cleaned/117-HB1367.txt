A BILL 
To prohibit certain noncompete agreements, and for other 
purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Workforce Mobility 
4
Act of 2021’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) The proliferation of noncompete agreements 
8
throughout sectors, occupational categories, and in-
9

come brackets is contrary to Congress’s commitment 
1
to fostering stronger wage growth for workers in the 
2
United States. Economists now estimate that 1 in 5 
3
workers is covered by a noncompete agreement. 
4
(2) Noncompete agreements are blunt instru-
5
ments that crudely protect employer interests and 
6
place a drag on national productivity by forcing cov-
7
ered workers to either idle for long periods of time 
8
or leave the industries where they have honed their 
9
skills altogether. 
10
(3) Enforceable noncompete agreements also re-
11
duce wages, restrict worker mobility, impinge on 
12
worker freedoms to maximize their labor market po-
13
tential, and slow the pace of American innovation. 
14
(4) Employers have access to legal recourses to 
15
protect their legitimate interests and property, in-
16
cluding trade secret protections, intellectual property 
17
protections, and nondisclosure agreements that do 
18
not inflict broad collateral harm on workers’ labor 
19
market prospects. 
20
(5) Employers that rely on a list or lists of ven-
21
dors, customers, or clients that are not easily ob-
22
tained by an individual through means other than 
23
the work relationship have adequate legal protection 
24

•HR 1367 IH
through the use of trade secrets protections and 
1
nondisclosure agreements. 
2
(6) Noncompete agreements broadly restrict 
3
employment options for workers in the United States 
4
when more narrowly targeted remedies are readily 
5
available to employers. 
6
(7) Fostering an environment where employers 
7
can flourish is necessary to promote vitality and 
8
prosperity in the economy. 
9
(8) Employers may retain critical skilled em-
10
ployees while ensuring that disincentives affecting 
11
mobility, including noncompete agreements, do not 
12
negatively impact the workforce in the United 
13
States.
