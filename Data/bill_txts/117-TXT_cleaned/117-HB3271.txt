SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON PUBLIC HEALTH AND CLI-
1
MATE CHANGE. 
2
(a) FINDINGS.—The U.S. Global Change Research 
3
Program Climate and Health Assessment states that— 
4
(1) the impacts of human-induced climate 
5
change are increasing nationwide; 
6
(2) rising greenhouse gas concentrations result 
7
in increases in temperature, changes in precipitation, 
8
increases in the frequency and intensity of some ex-
9
treme weather events, and rising sea levels; 
10
(3) these climate change impacts endanger our 
11
health by affecting our food and water sources, the 
12
air we breathe, the weather we experience, and our 
13
interactions with the built and natural environments; 
14
and 
15
(4) as the climate continues to change, the risks 
16
to human health continue to grow. 
17
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
18
gress that— 
19
(1) climate change poses threats to the United 
20
States and globally through its impacts on society, 
21
the economy, the physical environment, and national 
22
security; 
23
(2) climate change health threats are growing 
24
in scale and severity;

•HR 3271 IH
(3) climate change disproportionately affects 
1
people of the United States who are economically 
2
disadvantaged, belong to communities of color, or 
3
have other social and health vulnerabilities; 
4
(4) climate change impacts anywhere in the 
5
world can threaten the health of people of the 
6
United States through such pathways as infectious 
7
disease pandemics, climate-driven migration and dis-
8
placement, and social, economic, and political disrup-
9
tion; and 
10
(5) the Federal Government, in cooperation 
11
with international, State, Tribal, and local govern-
12
ments, nongovernmental organizations, businesses,
