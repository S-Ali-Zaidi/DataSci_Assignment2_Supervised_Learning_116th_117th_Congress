Whereas passenger vehicle occupant deaths rose 5 percent in 
2020; 
Whereas these historic increases in traffic deaths occurred as 
there was a 13 percent decrease in vehicle miles traveled; 
Whereas NHTSA’s data show the main behaviors leading to 
this increase were speeding, impaired driving, and failure 
to wear seat belts; 
Whereas, whether a driver is impaired by alcohol or drugs, 
speeding, driving too aggressively, driving distracted, or 
unable to stay awake at the wheel, bad driving choices 
put passengers at risk of serious injury or death; 
Whereas many lives might have been saved had a passenger 
in the car insisted that the driver slow down, stop 
texting, or not get behind the wheel in the first place; 
Whereas passengers, especially teens and young adults, need 
education and encouragement to empower them to save 
lives by calling out unsafe driving in the car as it hap-
pens; and 
Whereas parents also need education and encouragement to 
teach their children about the importance of speaking up 
or not getting in the car with someone who is drunk, 
under the influence of drugs, or distracted: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate 
1
concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that pas-

sengers in motor vehicles should be educated and encour-
