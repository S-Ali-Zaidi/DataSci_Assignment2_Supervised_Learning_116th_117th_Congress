CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the need to improve physical access to many 
federally funded facilities for all people of the United 
States, particularly people with disabilities. 
Whereas the First Amendment to the Constitution prevents 
Congress from making any law respecting an establish-
ment of religion, prohibiting the free exercise of religion, 
or abridging the freedom of speech, the freedom of the 
press, the right to peaceably assemble, or to petition for 
a governmental redress of grievances, and was adopted

•HCON 73 IH 
Whereas the Bill of Rights, specifically the First Amendment 
to the Constitution, calls for the right of all persons to 
peaceably assemble, and to this end, all persons, regard-
less of their physical ability, shall be offered equal oppor-
tunity to access all federally funded, in whole or part, 
amenities; 
Whereas, in the 32 years since the signing of the Americans 
with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.) 
(in this preamble referred to as the ‘‘ADA’’), there have 
been unprecedented advances in all forms of technology, 
typified by automatic doors; 
Whereas, in 2018, the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention found that 1 in 4 adults, or 61,000,000 people, 
have a disability; 
Whereas disability is a universal concern, as an aging popu-
lation increases the incidence of frailty and disability; 
Whereas, as significant advances in medical treatment result 
in increased survival rates, the incidence of disability in-
creases; 
Whereas, in 2020, the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that 
4,700,000 veterans received service-related disability ben-
efits; 
Whereas, in 2019, the percentage of people in the United 
States who reported having a work limitation due to a 
disability was 10.1 percent; 
Whereas the Act entitled ‘‘An Act to insure that certain 
buildings financed with Federal funds are so designed 
and constructed as to be accessible to the physically 
handicapped’’, approved August 12, 1968 (42 U.S.C. 
4151 et seq.) (commonly known as the Architectural Bar-
riers Act of 1968), was enacted to ensure that certain

federally funded facilities are designed and constructed to 
be accessible to people with disabilities; 
Whereas the United States Access Board (in this preamble 
referred to as the ‘‘Board’’) is in the process of devel-
oping new guidelines for public rights-of-way that will ad-
dress various issues, including access for blind pedes-
trians at street crossings, wheelchair access to on-street 
parking, and various constraints posed by space limita-
tions, roadway design practices, slope, and terrain; 
Whereas the Board’s new guidelines, when finalized, will 
cover pedestrian access to sidewalks and streets, includ-
ing crosswalks, curb ramps, street furnishings, pedestrian 
signals, parking, and other components of public rights- 
of-way; 
Whereas the Board’s aim in developing these guidelines is to 
ensure that access for persons with disabilities is pro-
vided wherever a pedestrian way is newly built or altered, 
and that the same degree of convenience, connection, and 
safety afforded the public generally is available to pedes-
trians with disabilities; 
Whereas, once these guidelines are adopted by the Depart-
ment of Justice, they will become enforceable standards 
under title II of the ADA; and 
Whereas the United States was founded on principles of 
equality and freedom, and these principles require that 
all people, including people with disabilities, are able to 
engage as equal members of society: Now, therefore, be 
it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate
