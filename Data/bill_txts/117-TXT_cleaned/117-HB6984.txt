Congress finds the following:

•HR 6984 IH
(1) Vladimir Putin has repeatedly threatened 
1
and violated the sovereignty and territorial integrity 
2
of Russia’s neighbors, including Belarus, Georgia, 
3
Moldova, and Ukraine to quash democratic move-
4
ments in those countries and strengthen his own 
5
power. 
6
(2) In 2014, Russia invaded and has since oc-
7
cupied regions of Ukraine, including areas of the 
8
Donetsk and Luhansk regions, after the Ukrainian 
9
people ousted, a corrupt and repressive President 
10
Viktor Yanukovych and expressed their clear desire 
11
to deepen their integration with the European 
12
Union. 
13
(3) On February 24, 2022, the Russian Federa-
14
tion, led by Vladimir Putin, drastically escalated his 
15
invasion in Ukraine, resulting in a full-scale invasion 
16
by the Russian Armed Forces and causing massive 
17
displacement in the country and region that threat-
18
ens to trigger a wider humanitarian crisis in Europe. 
19
(4) Vladimir Putin’s decision to escalate his in-
20
vasion of Ukraine is being met with stiff Ukrainian 
21
resistance and transatlantic and international resolve 
22
to support Ukraine and hold Russia accountable. 
23
(5) The United States and its allies and part-
24
ners around the globe provided every opportunity for 
25

•HR 6984 IH
a diplomatic resolution to this crisis to avoid unnec-
1
essary death and suffering. 
2
(6) Putin’s aggression in Ukraine threatens 
3
universal democratic ideals and transatlantic secu-
4
rity. 
5
(7) According to Human Rights Watch and 
6
international monitors, the Russian Armed Forces 
7
have committed grave violations of international hu-
8
manitarian and human rights law, including viola-
9
tions against children’s rights, the use of explosive 
10
weapons including cluster munitions in populated 
11
areas, and indiscriminate attacks on civilians, 
12
homes, and non-military infrastructure. 
13
(8) Adherence to the Geneva Conventions and 
14
their Additional Protocols is essential to ensure hu-
15
manitarian access and life-saving assistance can be 
16
maintained for civilian populations despite conflict. 
17
(9) As part of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine 
18
by the Russian Armed Forces, Vladimir Putin and 
19
Belarusian Alyaksandar Lukashenka have further 
20
cracked down domestically, including mass arrests, 
21
on any dissent on Russians and Belarusians who 
22
voice opposition to this war. 
23
(10) The invasion of Ukraine by the Russian 
24
Armed Forces threatens Belarusian and Russian 
25

dissidents living in Ukraine as well as ethnic and 
1
LGBTQI+ minorities and other vulnerable groups. 
2
(11) Ukrainians have displayed immense brav-
3
ery, courage, and resolve in standing up to protect 
4
democratic values and their sovereignty and resist il-
5
legal and unprovoked aggression from the Russian 
6
Armed Forces led by Putin. 
7
(12) The full-scale invasion of Ukraine by the 
8
Russian Armed Forces threatens to create a dire hu-
9
manitarian crisis in Europe with secondary and ter-
10
tiary impacts across the globe. 
11
(13) According to a rapid humanitarian needs 
12
assessment by the United Nations Office for Coordi-
13
nation of Humanitarian Affairs, in the next three 
14
months the conflict is projected to drive humani-
15
tarian needs for nearly 12 million people living in 
16
Ukraine at the time of the escalation, including a 
17
projected 6.7 million internally displaced persons 
18
within Ukraine, and as many as 4 million people in 
19
Ukraine projected to flee to neighboring countries 
20
for safety. 
21
(14) Prior to full-scale invasion of Ukraine by 
22
the Russian Armed Forces, around 1.4 million peo-
23
ple had been internally displaced inside Ukraine 
24
since Russia’s invasion in 2014, and potentially mil-
25
02:37 Mar 10, 2022
H6984

•HR 6984 IH
lions more will be displaced in Ukraine already in 
1
dire need of assistance and survivors of eight years 
2
of violence and insecurity. 
3
(15) According to the United Nations High 
4
Commissioner for Refugees the full-scale invasion of 
5
Ukraine by the Russian Armed Forces beginning in 
6
February of 2022 displaced roughly 1.5 million peo-
7
ple living in Ukraine within the first two weeks, with 
8
millions more expected to flee or be internally dis-
9
placed. 
10
(16) Ukraine’s neighbors (Moldova, Poland, 
11
Slovakia, Hungary, and Romania) have welcomed 
12
and provided immediate and unconditional support 
13
close to two million Ukrainian refugees. 
14
(17) Humanitarian efforts will be required 
15
across sectors to address the needs of refugees and 
16
internally displaced persons from Ukraine will re-
17
quire including shelter, protection, nutrition and 
18
food security, emergency telecommunications, logis-
19
tics, education, as well as water, sanitation and hy-
20
giene. 
21
(18) Humanitarian assistance efforts should 
22
take into account the gender, age, disability makeup 
23
of refugees and others in need of humanitarian as-
24
02:37 Mar 10, 2022
H6984

•HR 6984 IH
sistance to ensure adequate supplies of appropriate 
1
assistance including protection needs and services. 
2
(19) Humanitarian assistance should take into 
3
account the provision of mental health and psycho- 
4
social support to crisis affected populations with spe-
5
cific provisions for the needs of children. 
6
(20) In addition, the needs of the immediate 
7
humanitarian crisis, the further invasion and de-
8
struction of Ukraine by Russian Armed Forces will 
9
have secondary and tertiary effects for ongoing hu-
10
manitarian crises around the world, including exac-
11
erbating food insecurity and disrupting global agri-
12
cultural markets given Ukraine’s historical wheat 
13
production. 
14
(21) Ukraine is a primary source of grain and 
15
corn exports for the Middle East and Africa, which 
16
are already grappling with hunger issues, food short-
17
ages, and price increases. 
18
(22) The further invasion of Ukraine by the 
19
Russian Armed Forces will prevent farmers from 
20
fertilizing and replanting their crops, which will af-
21
fect output of production in the next harvest cycle, 
22
lower their total exports, and create further implica-
23
tion for global food security in the years to come.

(23) Many families who have fled Ukraine have 
1
lost their homes and their livelihoods and, thus, al-
2
though emerging survey data suggest the majority 
3
would like to return home, it is more likely that 
4
many will have to stay in third countries for an ex-
5
tended time as the situation in Ukraine stabilizes 
6
and critical infrastructure, communities, and homes 
7
are rebuilt. 
8
(24) The majority of these refugees are women 
9
and children, and the children will need access to 
10
language courses, education, and educational serv-
11
ices while seeking refuge in a third country. 
12
(25) On March 3, 2022, the Biden Administra-
13
tion, with the strong support of Congress, extended 
14
Temporary Protected Status for thousands of 
15
Ukrainians in the United States. 
16
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
17
It is the sense of Congress that the United States 
18
