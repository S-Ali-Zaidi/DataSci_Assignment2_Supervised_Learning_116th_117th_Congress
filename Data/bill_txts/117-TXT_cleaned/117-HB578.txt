A BILL 
To promote registered apprenticeships, including registered 
apprenticeships 
within 
in-demand 
industry 
sectors, 
through the support of workforce intermediaries, and 
for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Apprenticeship Hubs 
4
Across America Act of 2021’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following:

2 
•HR 578 IH
(1) Registered apprenticeship programs provide 
1
apprentices employment with structured on-the-job 
2
training, little to no student loan debt, competitive 
3
wages, industry-recognized credentials, direct access 
4
to jobs and careers, and in some cases, the potential 
5
to earn college credit toward an associate’s or bach-
6
elor’s degree. 
7
(2) According to the Department of Labor Ap-
8
prenticeship Toolkit, the average wage for a fully- 
9
proficient worker who completes an apprenticeship is 
10
$50,000 annually. Apprentices who complete their 
11
program earn approximately $300,000 more during 
12
their career than non-apprenticeship workers. 
13
(3) There are still very few apprenticeship posi-
14
tions in sectors with high job growth. According to 
15
data from the Department of Labor, health care— 
16
the industry with the greatest job growth—had only 
17
1,852 apprentices in 2016. Information technology, 
18
another sector with rapidly expanding job opportuni-
19
ties in the United States, had fewer than 1,000 ap-
20
prentices in 2016. 
21
(4) A major barrier to expanding registered ap-
22
prenticeships in high-growth job sectors is employ-
23
ers’ lack of familiarity with the process to establish, 
24
00:25 Feb 20, 2021

•HR 578 IH
and the requirements of, registered apprenticeship 
1
programs. 
2
(5) Workforce intermediaries, which are organi-
3
zations at the national, regional, State, or local level 
4
that help ease the process for employers in devel-
5
oping and delivering new registered apprenticeship 
6
programs, can serve as a catalyzing force for cre-
7
ating and expanding registered apprenticeships in 
8
high-growth job sectors through technical assistance 
9
and capacity building for employers, labor organiza-
10
tions, educational institutions, and government enti-
11
ties.
