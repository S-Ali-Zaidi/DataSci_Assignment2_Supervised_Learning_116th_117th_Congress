Whereas the bladder cancer diagnosis rate is expected to in-
crease by 3 percent in 2021, while many other forms of 
cancer are projected to decline; 
Whereas bladder cancer can directly impact all people, re-
gardless of age, sex, and race; 
Whereas bladder cancer is among the top 6 most diagnosed 
cancers in the United States, and the top 4 most com-
monly diagnosed cancers for our honored veterans; 
Whereas, if diagnosed early, bladder cancer is highly treat-
able, but survivability rates decrease substantially with 
later detection; 
Whereas smoking and occupational exposure to carcinomic 
chemicals are the top two causes of bladder cancer; 
Whereas studies have shown a higher level of bladder cancer 
in firefighters, veterans, and senior citizens than in the 
general public; 
Whereas bladder cancer symptoms, such as blood in the 
urine, are easily recognized, however, many Americans 
are unaware of the warning signs and often put off test-
ing and treatment; 
Whereas bladder cancer is known as one of the most expen-
sive cancers to treat on a per patient basis and has a re-
occurrence rate of approximately 50 to 80 percent, re-
quiring lifelong surveillance; 
Whereas while bladder cancer is more prevalent in men, 
women are commonly diagnosed at a later stage and face 
a worse prognosis even when diagnosed at the same stage 
as men;

Whereas there has been only one significant breakthrough in 
the past 30 years to advance the treatment of and move 
toward a cure for bladder cancer; 
Whereas the quality of life and chance of survival for a blad-
der cancer patient depends largely on new advancements 
and a renewed focus on research from both the Federal 
Government and private industry; 
Whereas increased awareness for bladder cancer will promote 
earlier diagnosis and increased chances of survival; 
Whereas, in 2021, Congress will require the Department of 
Veterans Affairs to dramatically increase bladder cancer 
treatments for the Nation’s veterans, living up to the 
promise the Nation made decades ago; 
Whereas based on the Nation’s experience diagnosing and 
caring for Vietnam veterans exposed to carcinogenic 
chemicals such as Agent Orange and Agent Blue, efforts 
are underway to document current servicemembers’ expo-
sure to burn pits; 
Whereas the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Pro-
grams, working concurrently with the National Institutes 
of Health, annually fund the high-risk, high-reward, re-
search required to one day discover a cure for bladder 
cancer; 
Whereas traditionally throughout May, survivors, caregivers, 
and loved ones unite for walks in communities across the 
United States to raise awareness for bladder cancer along 
with funds for bladder cancer research; 
Whereas the Bladder Cancer Advocacy Network has worked 
for more than 15 years to raise public awareness for 
bladder cancer while providing patients with the knowl-

Whereas the Bladder Cancer Advocacy Network annually 
funds cutting edge research in search of better treat-
ments and a final cure for bladder cancer while working
