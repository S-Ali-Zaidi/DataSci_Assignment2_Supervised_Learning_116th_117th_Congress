evidence-based means to prevent child abuse;

to harsh parenting and increased risk for potential abuse 
of children; 
Whereas, in 2020, an estimated 7,100,000 children were re-

Whereas, in 2020, there was an alarming increase in reports 
alleging maltreatment by children themselves to crisis 
hotlines; 
Whereas, in 2020, most children did not attend school in-per-
son due to the COVID–19 pandemic, making it difficult 
for the largest group of child abuse reporters, education 
personnel, to observe and report suspected maltreatment; 
Whereas the mental, physical, and economic stress of the 
COVID–19 pandemic has resulted in a heightened risk of 
child abuse; 
Whereas 2020 saw more than 21,700,000 reports of sus-
pected child sexual exploitation made to the National 
Center 
for 
Missing 
and 
Exploited 
Children’s 
CyberTipline, which marked the highest number of re-
ports ever received in 1 year; 
Whereas reports indicate that 1 in 10 children faces sexual 
abuse before their 18th birthday; 
Whereas approximately 1 in 7 children in the United States 
has experienced child abuse, neglect, or both during the 
past year; 
Whereas 1 in 5 children has received a sexual approach or 
solicitation on the internet during the past year; 
Whereas 93 percent of juvenile sexual assault victims know 
their abuser; 
Whereas children who are sexually abused, when not provided 
appropriate treatment, often suffer from lifelong prob-
lems, such as physical and mental health issues, drug and 
alcohol abuse, and suicide; 
Whereas children who are abused or neglected are more likely 
to be arrested for delinquent behavior as juveniles;

Whereas children who have experienced abuse are more likely 
to be arrested for violent and criminal behavior as adults; 
Whereas child abuse and neglect cost the Nation over 
$1,000,000,000 a year; 
Whereas education and awareness of possible signs of child 
abuse should be prioritized for purposes of prevention; 
Whereas Keep Kids Safe is a survivor-centered movement of 
organizations dedicated to preventing sexual violence 
against children and adolescents, and to healing and jus-
tice for survivors; 
Whereas this movement includes the Monique Burr Founda-
tion, Darkness to Light, Prevent Child Abuse America, 
Together for Girls, the SNAP network, the Army of Sur-
vivors, and the National Children’s Alliance; and 
Whereas these organizations play a critical role in preventing 
childhood sexual abuse and helping survivors heal and 
seek justice: Now, therefore, be it
