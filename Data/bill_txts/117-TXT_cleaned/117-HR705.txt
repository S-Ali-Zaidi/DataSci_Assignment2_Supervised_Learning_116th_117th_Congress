Whereas chemistry is the science of the basic units of matter 
and, consequently, plays a role in every aspect of human 
life; 
Whereas chemistry has broad applications, including food 
science, soil science, water quality, energy, sustainability, 
medicine, agriculture, and electronics; 
Whereas the science of chemistry is vital to improving the 
quality of human life and plays an important role in ad-
dressing critical global challenges; 
Whereas innovations in chemistry continue to spur economic 
growth and job creation and have applications for a wide

Whereas the practitioners of chemistry are catalysts of posi-
tive change in their communities and the world; 
Whereas National Chemistry Week is part of a broader vision 
to improve human life through chemistry and to advance 
the chemistry enterprise; 
Whereas the purpose of National Chemistry Week is to reach 
the public with educational messages about chemistry in 
order to foster greater understanding of and appreciation 
for the applications and benefits of chemistry; 
Whereas National Chemistry Week strives to stimulate the 
interest of young people, and particularly women and 
underrepresented groups, in enthusiastically studying 
science, technology, engineering, and mathematics and in 
pursuing science-related careers that lead to innovations 
and major scientific breakthroughs; 
Whereas National Chemistry Week signifies the collaborative 
nature of science and promotes partnership between sci-
entific societies, academia, industry, and the public; 
Whereas National Chemistry Week highlights many of the ev-
eryday uses of chemistry, including in food, dyes, pig-
ments, plastics, soaps, detergents, health products, and 
energy technologies; 
Whereas the theme of the 32d annual National Chemistry 
Week is ‘‘Fast or Slow . . . Chemistry Makes It Go!’’; 
and 
Whereas students who participate in National Chemistry 
Week deserve recognition and support for their efforts: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
