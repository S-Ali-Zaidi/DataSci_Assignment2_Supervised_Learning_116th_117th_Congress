eat the daily amount of fruits and vegetables rec-
1
ommended by national health authorities. 
2
(2) On average, more than 30 million children 
3
participate in the National School Lunch Program 
4
daily, with more than 70 percent qualifying for free 
5
or reduced-price meals based on family household in-
6
come. 
7
(3) Improving the healthfulness of school meals, 
8
including serving more fruits and vegetables, will im-
9
prove children’s eating habits and their health. The 
10
Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends that 
11
children ‘‘make half their plate fruits and vegeta-
12
bles’’ at each meal. 
13
(4) Research indicates that school salad bars 
14
are an effective strategy to increase children’s con-
15
sumption of a wide variety of fruits and vegetables. 
16
(5) Salad bars are one of the easiest ways for 
17
school food authorities to meet the new school lunch 
18
nutrition standards that require serving a fruit and 
19
a vegetable every day, a colorful variety of vegetables 
20
every week, and that students select at least one-half 
21
cup of a fruit or a vegetable at lunch. 
22
(6) Salad bars are effective in elementary, mid-
23
dle, and high school, they empower students to try 
24
new fruits and vegetables and are a tangible example
