Congress finds the following:

•HR 3544 IH
(1) Access to computers and computer tech-
1
nology is indispensable for success in the 21st cen-
2
tury. Millions of Americans do not regularly use a 
3
computer and research shows that substantial dis-
4
parities remain in both internet use and the quality 
5
of access with the digital divide concentrated among 
6
older, less educated, less affluent populations, espe-
7
cially veterans, low-income students, and senior citi-
8
zens. 
9
(2) The COVID–19 pandemic has highlighted 
10
the gap between those with computer access and 
11
those without. Millions of students, their families, 
12
and workers from across the economy were unable to 
13
do schoolwork, work remotely from home, or be able 
14
to connect to loved ones and their communities be-
15
cause of the digital divide. 
16
(3) Any Federal program that distributes re-
17
tired Federal computers to a public school, an edu-
18
cational nonprofit, or a nonprofit computer refur-
19
bisher for repair and distribution would benefit from 
20
a partnership with a nonprofit organization, whose 
21
mission is bridging the digital divide.
