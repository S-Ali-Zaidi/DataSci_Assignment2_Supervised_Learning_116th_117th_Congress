sic nurses are the bridge between the medical and legal 
needs of patients; 
Whereas more than 2,000,000 people are treated for violence- 
related injuries each year in the United States; 
Whereas patients who experience violence sustain physical in-
juries, as well as acute and chronic physical and mental 
health conditions, including sexually transmitted infec-

suicidal ideation;

ratively within health care and community systems ensur-

tient populations, including patients who have experi-
enced sexual assault or abuse, intimate or interpersonal

examiner, death investigator, correctional nurse, forensic 
psychiatric nurse, legal nurse consultant, forensic geri-
atric specialist, nurse attorney, and forensic clinical nurse

ices as rates and severity of violence increase: Now,
