Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Unclaimed Savings 
4
Bond Act of 2021’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Tens of billions of dollars’ worth of savings 
8
bonds have never been redeemed by their owners, in-

cluding millions of bonds that matured years and 
1
even decades ago. The Department of the Treasury 
2
refers to these bonds as Matured Unredeemed Debt 
3
(‘‘MUD’’). 
4
(2) The United States savings bond program 
5
was created to fund critical government operations 
6
during times of national need while guaranteeing to 
7
citizens the promise of a safe return. 
8
(3) The States are the traditional custodians of 
9
abandoned property and are best positioned to help 
10
owners of abandoned bonds recover the proceeds of 
11
their investment. 
12
(4) Until abandoned property is claimed, the 
13
States are able to devote unclaimed funds to the 
14
health and welfare of their citizens. 
15
(5) Allowing States to utilize the proceeds of 
16
abandoned savings bonds provides them with liquid-
17
ity and the ability to serve their citizens without in-
18
creasing the Federal deficit.

ing a State with title to the bond. Nothing in this section, 
2

5
cable savings bonds. 
6
‘‘(2) The Secretary shall recognize an order of a court 
7
of competent jurisdiction that vests title to an applicable

10
retary with a certified copy of such order.

‘‘(3)(A) If a State has title or is seeking to obtain 
12

15
available records or information—

‘‘(i) relating to the purchase or ownership of 
17
such bond, including any transactions involving such 
18

‘‘(ii) which may provide other identifying infor-

‘‘(B) Any records or information provided to a State

‘‘(B) The Secretary may not prescribe any regulation 
9
which prevents or prohibits a State from obtaining title 
10
to an applicable savings bond or redeeming such bond pur-
11
suant to the procedures described in subparagraph (A). 
12
‘‘(C) In the case of an applicable savings bond which 
13
is lost, stolen, destroyed, mutilated, defaced, or otherwise 
14
not in the possession of the State, if the State has re-
15
quested records and information under paragraph (3)(A),
