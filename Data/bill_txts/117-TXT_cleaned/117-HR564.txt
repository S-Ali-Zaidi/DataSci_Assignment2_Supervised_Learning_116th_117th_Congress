RESOLUTION 
Reaffirming the comprehensive United States approach to 
tobacco control and encouraging the World Health Orga-
nization to embrace technological advancements to com-
bat noncommunicable diseases. 
Whereas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, approximately 40 million Americans smoke 
cigarettes on a regular basis, and smoking remains one 
of the most preventable forms of noncommunicable dis-
ease around the world; 
Whereas, though the best health outcomes for current smok-
ers result from quitting nicotine altogether, the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention estimates less than 
10 percent of adult smokers will successfully stop smok-
ing cigarettes in a given year;

Whereas the bipartisan Family Smoking Prevention and To-
bacco Control Act of 2009 (Public Law 111–31) provided 
the Food and Drug Administration authority to regulate 
the tobacco industry and develop a pathway to bring sci-
entifically substantiated less harmful alternatives to the 
market for adult consumers who would otherwise con-
tinue smoking cigarettes; 
Whereas, in 2017, the Food and Drug Administration an-
nounced a comprehensive approach to tobacco control 
based on cessation, prevention, and harm reduction, and 
recognized a continuum of risk with combustible tobacco 
products on one end of the spectrum and noncombustible 
products such as heated tobacco, vapor, and snus on the 
other end; 
Whereas, as part of its scientific evaluation to assess whether 
a product is appropriate for the protection or promotion 
of public health, the Food and Drug Administration as-
sesses various criteria, including the potential health ef-
fects, nicotine levels, flavor variants, potential appeal to, 
and likelihood of use by youth and nonsmokers, and im-
poses post-market surveillance requirements; 
Whereas the United States approach to tobacco control re-
quires the Food and Drug Administration to evaluate all 
available scientific data and the Food and Drug Adminis-
tration process allows for all interested parties to engage 
the agency in an open and transparent manner regarding 
the development of such innovative products; 
Whereas other governments have embraced similar ap-
proaches to tobacco harm reduction, including the United 
Kingdom, New Zealand, Greece, and Norway, and have 
provided adult consumers information about and access 
to scientifically substantiated reduced-harm products;

•HRES 564 IH 
Whereas the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control ne-
gotiated and implemented under the auspices of the 
World Health Organization, includes harm reduction as 
one of the main pillars of tobacco control; 
Whereas the World Health Organization has yet to promote 
harm reduction, embrace innovation and technological ad-
vancements, and recognize the science supporting tobacco 
harm reduction as a means of accelerating the decline of 
cigarette smoking and reducing noncommunicable dis-
eases associated with smoking; 
Whereas the World Health Organization minimizes the Food 
and Drug Administration’s evaluation process of non-
combustible nicotine-containing products, and in many 
countries the World Health Organization encourages 
health regulators to prohibit these products from the 
market or tax and regulate them in the same manner as 
cigarettes; and 
Whereas the World Health Organization estimates there will 
be 
approximately 
1,400,000,000 
cigarette 
smokers 
throughout the world in 2025, and efforts to reduce con-
sumption through increased taxation or other regulatory 
measures have demonstrated limited impact on the de-
cline of smoking prevalence: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives directs 
1
the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Health and

Human Services to proactively engage the World Health 
3
Organization to promote the comprehensive United States

approach to tobacco control, and encourage the adoption

of tobacco harm reduction as a pragmatic means of com-
