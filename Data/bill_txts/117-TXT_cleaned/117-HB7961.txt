To protect hospital personnel from violence, and for other 
purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Safety From Violence

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following find-
8
ings:

•HR 7961 IH
(1) The incidence of assault and intimidation 
1
against hospital employees poses a serious national 
2
problem. 
3
(2) The problem of assault and intimidation 
4
against hospital and health care employees preceded 
5
the COVID–19 pandemic. According to an April 
6
2020 Bureau of Labor Statistics report, the health 
7
care and social service industries experienced the 
8
highest rates of injuries caused by workplace vio-
9
lence and were 5 times as likely to suffer a work-
10
place violence injury than workers overall in 2018. 
11
That report also found that the incidence rate for 
12
workplace violence against health care workers had 
13
steadily increased since 2011. The COVID–19 pan-
14
demic exacerbated this growing problem. 
15
(3) Workplace violence in hospitals inhibits hos-
16
pital employees from performing their duties and 
17
thereby disrupts the delivery of health care services 
18
and leads to adverse patient outcomes. Violence to-
19
wards hospital workers also has been associated with 
20
decreased productivity and quality of care, employee 
21
absenteeism, and increased employee turnover. 
22
(4) State and local authorities are now and will 
23
continue to be responsible for prosecuting the over-
24
whelming majority of violent crimes in the United 
25

States, including assault and intimidation against 
1
hospital employees. These authorities can address 
2
the problem of assault and intimidation against hos-
3
pital employees more effectively with greater Federal 
4
law enforcement involvement. 
5
(5) Existing Federal law is inadequate to ad-
6
dress this problem. 
7
(6) Assault and intimidation against hospital 
8
employees substantially affects interstate commerce 
9
in many ways, including the following: 
10
(A) Health care services are a significant 
11
part of the national economy. In 2020, expendi-
12
tures on health care services accounted for 19.7 
13
percent of the country’s gross domestic product 
14
(or $4,100,000,000,000). Within health care, 
15
hospitals and health systems are economic pil-
16
lars that create jobs and support economic 
17
growth across State lines. In 2020, hospitals di-
18
rectly employed 6,300,000 individuals. More 
19
broadly, hospitals supported 17,600,000 jobs 
20
throughout the entire interstate economy— 
21
nearly 1 out of 8 jobs in the United States— 
22
and supported $3,600,000,000,000 in overall 
23
economic activity.

(B) The health care market, and hospitals 
1
in particular, are heavily regulated by the Fed-
2
eral Government. 
3
(C) Hospital revenue comes from interstate 
4
or Federal sources, such as out-of-State insur-
5
ers or Medicare. 
6
(D) Hospital employees who are victims of 
7
assault or intimidation are prevented from pur-
8
chasing goods and services, obtaining or sus-
9
taining employment, or participating in other 
10
commercial activity. 
11
(E) Facilities and instrumentalities of 
12
interstate commerce have been used in the com-
13
mission of assault and intimidation against hos-
14
pital employees. 
15
(F) Assault and intimidation against hos-
16
pital employees has been committed using arti-
17
cles that have traveled in interstate commerce. 
18
(7) In Summit Health, Ltd. v. Pinhas, 500 
19
U.S. 322, 329–30 (1991), the Supreme Court of the 
20
United States held that it is ‘‘clear’’ that hospitals 
21
are ‘‘regularly’’ engaged in interstate commerce, per-
22
forming services for out-of-State patients and gener-
23
ating revenues from out-of-State sources.

•HR 7961 IH
(8) In Taylor v. United States, 579 U.S. 
1
lll (2016), the Supreme Court of the United 
2
States ruled that activities that affect commerce 
3
may be regulated so long as they substantially affect 
4
interstate commerce in the aggregate, even if their 
5
individual impact on interstate commerce is minimal. 
6
In addition, as the United States Court of Appeals 
7
for the Fourth Circuit recognized in United States 
8
v. Hill, 927 F.3d 188 (4th Cir. 2019), Taylor and 
9
other Supreme Court decisions establish that when 
10
Congress may regulate an economic or commercial 
11
activity—as it may with respect to hospitals—it also 
12
may regulate violent conduct that interferes with or 
13
affects that activity. Accordingly, if individuals are 
14
engaged in ongoing economic or commercial activity 
15
subject to congressional regulation—as hospital em-
16
ployees are—then Congress also may prohibit violent 
17
crime that interferes with or affects such individuals’ 
18
ongoing economic or commercial activity. 
19
(9) Federal jurisdiction over certain violent 
20
crimes against hospital employees enables Federal, 
21
State, and local authorities to work together as part-
22
ners in the investigation and prosecution of such 
23
crimes.

(10) The problem of assault and intimidation 
1
against hospital employees is serious, widespread, 
2
and interstate in nature as to warrant Federal as-
3
sistance to hospitals to combat that activity.
