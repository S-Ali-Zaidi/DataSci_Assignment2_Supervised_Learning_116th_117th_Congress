RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the designation of February 4, 2021, 
as ‘‘National Cancer Prevention Day’’. 
Whereas National Cancer Prevention Day is a day to remind 
us that, when looking at cancer, we need to look at pre-
vention and reducing risks for human health and the en-
vironment; 
Whereas when we work to prevent cancer risks, it impacts 
human health, the environment, and the economy; 
Whereas cancer is one of the leading causes of death around 
the world and has touched the lives of nearly everyone, 
either directly or indirectly; 
Whereas the disease is the cause of nearly 1 out of every 4 
deaths in the United States;
