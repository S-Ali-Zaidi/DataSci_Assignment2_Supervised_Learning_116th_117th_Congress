Whereas, in 2019, 34,000,000 people including nearly 
11,000,000 children were living in poverty based on the 
Official Poverty Measure (OPM); 
Whereas 1 in 7 children live in poverty and more than 
4,500,000 of these children lived in extreme poverty, at 
less than half the poverty level, and nearly 3 in 4 poor 
children were children of color; 
Whereas child poverty creates gaps in cognitive skills for very 
young children, puts children at greater risk of hunger 
and homelessness, jeopardizes their health and ability to 
learn, and fuels the intergenerational cycle of poverty; 
Whereas communities of color face disproportionate rates of 
poverty and inequality; 
Whereas approximately 8,900,000 Black, 10,500,000 Latinx, 
2,000,000 Asian, and 2,100,000 Native and Indigenous 
people live in poverty in the United States; 
Whereas more than 1 in 4 Black children and more than 1 
in 5 Hispanic and American Indian/Alaska Native chil-
dren were poor compared with 1 in 12 White children; 
Whereas income inequality is the worst it has been in five

•HRES 67 IH 
Whereas, in 2019, 35,200,000 people, including 10,700,000 
children, were deemed food insecure, including the 
11,900,000 people living in 5,300,000 households defined 
by the Department of Agriculture as very food insecure, 
a number virtually unchanged since 2018; 
Whereas if COVID–19 incidences continue as projected 
through this year and next, the number of people experi-
encing food insecurity in 2020 would increase by over 
17,000,000, including nearly 7,000,000 children, which 
means 54,000,000 people (1 in 6) would experience food 
insecurity in 2020, including 18,000,000 children (1 in 
4); 
Whereas the Federal minimum wage has not changed from 
$7.25 per hour since 2009, and Federal law has allowed 
employers to pay tipped workers just $2.13 per hour 
since 1991; 
Whereas the value of the minimum wage has declined in real 
terms by more than 30 percent since 1968; 
Whereas the Official Poverty Measure (OPM) has been ad-
justed only for inflation since 1963 and does not ade-
quately capture sufficient needs for families to cover 
food, housing, utilities, and childcare expenses; 
Whereas 62,000,000 workers in the United States work for 
less than a living wage; 
Whereas over 200,000 people with disabilities work for a sub-
minimum wage; 
Whereas the United States does not require a national min-
imum paid sick time standard, and therefore working 
adults without paid sick leave are three times more likely 
to have incomes below the poverty line;

•HRES 67 IH 
Whereas fewer than 40 percent of American working adults 
have access to paid medical leave to address a serious ill-
ness or injury through employer-provided short-term dis-
ability insurance, and fewer than 60 percent are eligible 
to take unpaid FMLA (Family and Medical Leave Act), 
leaving millions of workers and families just 1 accident 
or illness away from economic devastation; 
Whereas approximately 5,200,000 workers are working in in-
voluntary part-time jobs when they would prefer full-time 
jobs; 
Whereas millions of people working in hourly jobs have un-
stable, unpredictable work schedules that do not give 
them the notice and input they need to plan their lives 
and care for their families; 
Whereas ‘‘fissuring’’ of the workplace, has resulted in more 
subcontracted, temporary, and 1099 positions that lack 
benefits and workplace protections, leading to greater 
economic precarity for low-wage workers; 
Whereas according to the 2019 Federal Reserve report on the 
economic well-being of United States households, 4 in 10 
Americans say they are not able to cover an unexpected 
expense of $400; 
Whereas the COVID–19 pandemic may exacerbate poverty, 
especially for children, and has exposed the shortcomings 
of the United States economic system and social safety 
net; 
Whereas if adequate measures are not taken to help Ameri-
cans during the COVID–19 pandemic, the Center on 
Poverty and Social Policy at Columbia University 
projects that 21,000,000 more individuals will be in pov-
erty, the highest recorded rate of poverty since 1967;

•HRES 67 IH 
Whereas according to the same Columbia University report, 
child poverty could rise by 53 percent with Black and 
Latino children bearing a disproportionate risk of falling 
into or deeper into poverty; 
Whereas, as of May 21, 2020, 38,600,000 Americans have 
filed for unemployment since mid-March because busi-
nesses have shut down or reduced their payroll in re-
sponse to the COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas economic distress faced during the COVID–19 pan-
demic will disproportionately impact children, women, 
working-class people, LGBTQ+ communities, and Black 
and Brown communities; 
Whereas the COVID–19 pandemic threatens to drastically in-
crease poverty for children and families; 
Whereas the COVID–19 pandemic is disrupting children’s 
daily lives and there are likely to be long-term and nega-
tive consequences for child development and future suc-
cess; 
Whereas low-income children and families are often the tar-
gets of discrimination based on their socioeconomic status 
as well as other social indicators such as race or eth-
nicity, immigration status, ability, sex, sexual orientation, 
and gender identity; 
Whereas low-income families pay nearly 35 percent of their 
income on childcare compared to middle-class families 
who pay roughly 14 percent of their income on childcare; 
Whereas poverty has lasting effects on a child’s neural and 
functional brain development and mental health; 
Whereas poverty exacerbates the student achievement rate 
and schools remain economically segregated;

•HRES 67 IH 
Whereas child poverty costs the United States between 
$800,000,000,000 and $1,100,000,000,000 annually; 
Whereas protecting children against the lifelong consequences 
of poverty will improve their life and reduce child poverty 
in future generations; 
Whereas poverty exacerbates the student achievement rate 
and many schools remain economically and racially seg-
regated; 
Whereas school districts with high poverty rates often receive 
the least amount of funding; 
Whereas the number of students experiencing poverty and 
homelessness has increased by 11 percent; 
Whereas LGBTQ+ students face poverty and homelessness 
because they are forced to leave their homes because of 
their sexual orientation or gender identity; 
Whereas according to the Department of Education, 
1,500,000 school-aged children experienced homelessness 
during the 2017–2018 school year; 
Whereas many low-income children and families do not re-
ceive the full value of the current Child Tax Credit 
(CTC) as it leaves behind 23,000,000 children, including 
50 percent of Black and Latino Children; 
Whereas to reduce child poverty long term, children also need 
access to affordable, comprehensive physical and behav-
ioral health care, stable shelter, consistent and nutritious 
meals, affordable high-quality early development and 
learning opportunities, high performing schools and col-
leges, and families and neighborhoods free from violence;

•HRES 67 IH 
Whereas 29 percent of Americans skipped refilling their pre-
scriptions because of high costs, and 26 percent struggled 
to pay medical bills; 
Whereas more than 500,000 people experience poverty and 
homelessness on any given night, a number which has in-
creased over the past 2 years; 
Whereas the criminal-legal system contributes to a cycle of 
poverty by issuing court-imposed fines and fees and 
threatening imprisonment for minor infractions and civil 
violations; 
Whereas according to the Prison Policy Initiative, families 
spend almost $2,900,000,000 on exorbitant commissary 
costs and phone calls to support their incarcerated loved 
ones; 
Whereas formerly incarcerated people face barriers to em-
ployment, housing, and social support programs after re-
lease and access to higher education, adult education, 
and workforce development training opportunities after 
release; 
Whereas nearly 1 in 2 United States children have at least 
1 parent with a criminal record, and the barriers associ-
ated with a parent’s record can stunt a child’s cognitive 
development, school performance, and educational attain-
ment; 
Whereas children in immigrant families make up one-quarter 
of all children in the United States, and are more likely 
to face systemic barriers to accessing economic and nutri-
tion supports that can aid their health and development 
with data from the nationally representative Well-Being 
and Basic Needs Survey (WBNS) showing that over 3 in 
10 adults in low-income immigrant families with children

(31.5 percent) reported that they or a family member 
were chilled from using benefits like SNAP, Medicaid, the 
Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) or housing 
subsidies in 2019; 
Whereas globally, people living in areas with high concentra-
tions of poverty will be disproportionately impacted by 
climate change; 
Whereas voter suppression and lack of access to voting, in-
cluding early voting or alternative methods, leads to a 
disproportionate underrepresentation of low-income peo-
ple; 
Whereas the United States should redistribute wealth and 
Federal assistance to reduce poverty and increase eco-
nomic opportunity; 
Whereas an investment of $24,400,000,000 per year in K– 
12 schools and teachers could start to boost academic 
performance among poor and struggling children for 
about the same cost as a wall at the southern border of 
the United States; 
Whereas for every $1 invested in early childhood education, 
society would gain $7.30 due to reduced poverty, lower 
incarceration rates, and better health outcomes; 
Whereas addressing climate change with a $200,000,000,000 
per year investment in a clean energy transition would 
reduce poverty by creating 2,700,000 new jobs; 
Whereas raising income tax rates by 1 percent in the top 2 
income brackets would raise about $125,000,000,000 
over 10 years that can be used in assistance for people 
living in poverty; 
Whereas ending mass incarceration and instead adopting a

$4,000,000,000 that can be used to invest in people liv-

sustained by humans, including policymakers, and
