A BILL 
To require certain nonprofit and not-for-profit social welfare 
organizations to submit disclosure reports on foreign 
funding to the Attorney General; and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Think Tank Trans-
4
parency Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Think tanks have provided Congress and 
8
the Administration with a wealth of research and 
9

2 
•HR 8996 IH
scholarship that largely has benefitted the American 
1
public by improving the drafting, enactment, and en-
2
forcement of U.S. policy. 
3
(2) There is broad bipartisan agreement that 
4
think tanks possess enormous influence on the pas-
5
sage and enforcement of policies, particularly those 
6
that relate to foreign policy. 
7
(3) In recent years, foreign funding of think 
8
tanks has increased substantially. 
9
(4) Congress, the Administration, and especially 
10
the American people have a right to know which 
11
think tanks receive foreign funds and to assess for 
12
themselves the extent that foreign influence should 
13
be considered when analyzing the credibility and 
14
value of research and scholarship produced by such 
15
organizations that receive foreign funds. 
16
(5) The House has already recognized the na-
17
tional security issues inherent in undue foreign in-
18
fluence of entities with covert sources of foreign 
19
funding who testify before Congress. Since 2015, in-
20
dividuals who testify before the U.S. House of Rep-
21
resentatives have been required to disclose relevant 
22
foreign funding sources directed to them or their 
23
employers in Truth in Testimony disclosure forms.

•HR 8996 IH
(The original looser requirement was enacted in 
1
1997.) 
2
(6) Over 30 years ago, Congress enacted section 
3
117 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) in 
4
light of concerns about the growing financial rela-
5
tionship between U.S. universities and foreign 
6
sources. Congress balanced academic freedom and 
7
national security by mandating financial trans-
8
parency through required reporting of contracts with 
9
and gifts from a foreign source. 
10
(7) Section 117 does not prohibit institutions 
11
from taking foreign money; it mandates accurate 
12
and transparent disclosures of sources and amounts 
13
to the Department of Education. In 2019, the De-
14
partment took concrete steps to enforce section 117 
15
by ensuring the integrity of reporting requirements, 
16
confirming the correct reporting and categorization 
17
of donations, and prohibiting the use of domestic 
18
conduits and intermediaries to avoid the disclosures 
19
of foreign gifts. 
20
(8) Between 2011 and 2021, Russia has given 
21
at least $160 million to U.S. universities. China 
22
alone has given at least $2.7 billion during the same 
23
time frame. And during that span, the State of 
24
00:38 Oct 13, 2022
H8996
4 
•HR 8996 IH
Qatar has given at least $5 billion to U.S. univer-
1
sities. 
2
(9) Each of these nations has a repressive and 
3
deeply troubling record on human rights, and all 
4
three have engaged in cyber espionage targeting 
5
Americans. 
6
(10) Russia, China, and Qatar all pose grave 
7
threats to U.S. national security interests, yet they 
8
have successfully lavished billions of dollars to cul-
9
tivate strong ties with institutions of higher edu-
10
cation and research across the United States. 
11
(11) There is also evidence suggesting that 
12
Qatar encouraged and potentially facilitated U.S. 
13
universities receiving its largess to flout U.S. disclo-
14
sure requirements under section 117 of the Higher 
15
Education Act. 
16
(12) Although the Center for International Pol-
17
icy conducted a study in 2020 that concluded that 
18
think tanks focused on federal policy received at 
19
least $174 million in funding from foreign govern-
20
mental entities between 2014 and 2018, there is cur-
21
rently no means to determine the actual level or ex-
22
tent of foreign influence on such think tanks. 
23
(13) What is clear is the vast amount of foreign 
24
funding that U.S. based think tanks receive, and 
25
00:38 Oct 13, 2022
H8996
5 
•HR 8996 IH
that it affects the direction of their policy rec-
1
ommendations. 
2
(14) One prominent think tank, the East West 
3
Institute, received substantial funding from China’s 
4
People’s Liberation Army (which conducts cyber es-
5
pionage attacks, including against Americans). 
6
(15) The Stimson Center worked to signifi-
7
cantly alter the Homeland and Cyber Threat Act 
8
(H.R. 1607, introduced into the 117th Congress on 
9
March 8, 2021). The HACT Act, which would pro-
10
vide an exception to the Foreign Sovereign Immuni-
11
ties Act of 1976 (FSIA) to allow U.S. persons 
12
harmed 
by 
foreign-government 
sponsored 
13
cyberattacks to bring civil claims for damages, 
14
passed in the last Congress with broad bipartisan 
15
support. The changes advocated by the Stimson 
16
Center would gut the bill and render it completely 
17
ineffective in holding foreign nations and their 
18
agents responsible for cyberattacks on and in the 
19
United States. 
20
(16) One of the main sources of the Stimson 
21
Center’s funding is the State of Qatar, a major 
22
sponsor of terrorism worldwide and one of the most 
23
notorious sponsors of cyberattacks against U.S. enti-
24
ties. In 2019 alone (the last year public figures are 
25
00:38 Oct 13, 2022
H8996
6 
•HR 8996 IH
available) the Stimson Center took over $600,000 in 
1
contributions from the Government of Qatar. 
2
(17) The Brookings Institution has received at 
3
least $22 million from the State of Qatar from 2013 
4
through 2021, but the exact amount has not been 
5
disclosed publicly. 
6
(18) There is also significant concern in Con-
7
gress about potential contractual stipulations tied to 
8
foreign funding that could be leveraged by foreign 
9
powers to exert even greater influence over the re-
10
search and policy recommendations of think tanks 
11
that the Federal Government and the American pub-
12
lic would otherwise believe to be independent. 
13
(19) In a 2007 ‘‘Establishment Agreement’’ be-
14
tween the Brookings Institution and Qatar’s Min-
15
istry of Foreign Affairs—which appears to have 
16
been in place in its original form through the end of 
17
2021—the Doha ‘‘branch’’ of the Brookings Institu-
18
tion, called Brookings Doha Center, was effectively 
19
owned and controlled by the Emir of Qatar. Under 
20
the terms of the contract, the Brookings Institu-
21
tion’s role in the Doha Center was limited to that 
22
of a ‘‘Promoter’’. 
23
(20) As only revealed publicly in June 2022, 
24
the Brookings Doha Center was a separate and dis-
25
00:38 Oct 13, 2022

•HR 8996 IH
tinct legal entity, specifically a Private Foundation 
1
for the Public Benefit, the same incorporation status 
2
as the State of Qatar’s propaganda arm, Al Jazeera. 
3
(21) Pursuant to the 2007 Establishment 
4
Agreement, the Director of the Brookings Doha 
5
Center was required to report directly to Qatar’s 
6
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, including to ‘‘engage in 
7
regular consultation . . . regarding the development 
8
and ongoing operations’’ and for prior approval of 
9
‘‘programs that will be developed by the [Brookings 
10
Doha] Center’’. 
11
(22) The Brookings Doha Center was renamed 
12
the Middle East Council on Global Affairs, and evi-
13
dence indicates that it is now entirely under the con-
14
trol of the Qatari Government. According to a Janu-
15
ary 2022 ‘‘Amendment’’ to the 2007 Articles of In-
16
corporation, the Brookings Institution ceded the 
17
‘‘Promoter’’ role for Brookings Doha Center to a 
18
senior employee of Qatar’s Ministry of Foreign Af-
19
fairs, Majed Al-Ansari. This Amendment also called 
20
on the Middle East Council to assume control of in-
21
tellectual property rights that had been under the 
22
‘‘Brookings’’ brand, including the content from and 
23
followers of the ‘‘@BrookingsDoha’’ Twitter ac-
24
count. 
25

•HR 8996 IH
(23) Congress currently is unable to determine 
1
what other agreements that the Brookings Institu-
2
tion or other influential think tanks have with for-
3
eign governmental entities, a void which has already 
4
been exploited by at least the State of Qatar in ob-
5
taining prior approval of budgets and research 
6
projects conducted under the branding of the Brook-
7
ings Institution and the Brookings Doha Center in 
8
the aforementioned 2007 contract, or the trans-
9
ference of valuable intellectual property to the 
10
Qatari Government pursuant to the 2022 amend-
11
ment. 
12
(24) There is broad bipartisan agreement that 
13
undue foreign influence obscured through the use of 
14
proxies—or hidden by the powerful brand of a highly 
15
respected think tank—threatens the national secu-
16
rity interests of the United States. There is also 
17
broad agreement that transparency is the most im-
18
portant and effective tool for reducing the harm of 
19
foreign influence targeting U.S. public policy or pub-
20
lic opinion. 
21
(25) As such, this bill aims to provide critical 
22
transparency regarding the foreign funding provided 
23
to and the related contractual agreements with think
