13
SIONS. 
14
For any decision by a covered entity based solely on

(1) inform such individual of what personal in-
20
formation is being or may be used for such decision;

nisms for the purpose of increasing the usability of the 
14
product or service provided by a covered entity that—

21
havioral characteristics.

(e) USABILITY.—The term ‘‘usability’’ as used in 
23
subsection (d) does not include optimizations or other al-
