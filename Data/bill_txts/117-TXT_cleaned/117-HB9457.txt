(1) human activity is the dominant cause of ob-

2
(2) climate change is increasing the frequency

and intensity of wildfires, droughts, severe storms, 
4
heat waves, rising of sea levels, and severe weather 
5
events;

(3) the Federal Government has—

Framework 
Convention 
on 
Climate

12
Agreement’’), to reduce greenhouse gas emis-
13

(B) a responsibility to mitigate current and 
15
future impacts of climate change to protect the

(4) crypto-asset mining operations— 
19
(A) can be energy intensive; and 
20
(B) unlike most other technologies, are 
21
often designed to generally increase computing

23
creased energy consumption;

1
more energy annually than countries such as Chile 
2
or Bangladesh consume; 
3
(6) crypto-asset mining operations often rely on 
4
fossil fuels for power, which contributes to green-
5
house gas emissions; 
6
(7) the carbon dioxide emissions of the United 
7
States from Bitcoin mining were estimated at 21 to 
8
35 megatons per year in 2022, which is equivalent 
9
to the annual emissions from more than 4,500,000 
10
to 7,500,000 gasoline-powered cars driven for 1 
11
year; 
12
(8) crypto-asset mining can also cause local 
13
noise and water pollution; 
14
(9) the number of crypto-asset mining facilities 
15
in the United States is increasing, and the share of 
16
the United States of global Bitcoin mining rose from 
17
3.5 percent in 2020 to 38 percent in 2022; 
18
(10) crypto-asset mining is an emergent indus-
19
try, and the potential of crypto-asset mining to exac-
20
erbate systemic racial, social, environmental, and

economic injustices is not sufficiently understood;
