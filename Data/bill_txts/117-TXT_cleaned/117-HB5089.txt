•HR 5089 IH
(1) continued increases in new automobile effi-
1
ciency are needed to improve consumer welfare and 
2
reduce carbon emissions; 
3
(2) the widespread availability of low-carbon, 
4
high-octane fuel will allow continued cost-effective 
5
improvements in automobile efficiency by enabling 
6
increased engine compression ratios; 
7
(3) high-octane automobiles and low-carbon 
8
fuels are readily available to consumers at little in-
9
cremental cost; 
10
(4) ethanol is a cost-effective and low-carbon 
11
octane enhancer; 
12
(5) the widespread adoption of climate-smart 
13
practices and precision technologies by United 
14
States corn producers over the past decade have fur-
15
ther reduced the carbon intensity of conventional 
16
ethanol; 
17
(6) on average, ethanol has been estimated to 
18
have lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions that are 46 
19
percent lower than average gasoline, with some corn 
20
ethanol achieving a 61-percent reduction compared 
21
to gasoline; and 
22
(7) ethanol has one of the highest blending oc-
23
tane values available in the marketplace.
