A BILL 
To amend the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets 
Act of 1968 to authorize public safety officer death bene-
fits to officers suffering from post-traumatic stress dis-
order or acute stress disorder, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Public Safety Officer 
4
Support Act of 2022’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 6943 IH
(1) Every day, public safety officers, including 
1
police officers, firefighters, emergency medical tech-
2
nicians, and others, work to maintain the safety, 
3
health, and well-being of the communities they serve. 
4
(2) This means public safety officers are rou-
5
tinely called to respond to stressful and potentially 
6
traumatic situations, often putting their own lives in 
7
danger. 
8
(3) This work not only puts public safety offi-
9
cers at risk for experiencing harm, serious injury, 
10
and cumulative and acute trauma, but also places 
11
them at up to 25.6 times higher risk for developing 
12
post-traumatic stress disorder when compared to in-
13
dividuals without such experiences. 
14
(4) Psychological evidence indicates that law 
15
enforcement officers experience significant job-re-
16
lated stressors and exposures that may confer in-
17
creased risk for mental health morbidities (such as 
18
post-traumatic stress disorder and suicidal thoughts, 
19
ideation, intents, and behaviors) and hastened mor-
20
tality. 
21
(5) Public safety officers often do not have the 
22
resources or support they need, leaving them at 
23
higher risk for long-term mental health con-
24
sequences. 
25

•HR 6943 IH
(6) Whereas, although the Department of De-
1
fense already considers servicemember suicides to be 
2
line-of-duty deaths and provides Federal support to 
3
eligible surviving families, the Federal Government 
4
does not recognize public safety officer suicides as 
5
deaths in the line of duty. 
6
(7) In 2017, the Department of Justice ap-
7
proved 481 claims under the Public Safety Officers’ 
8
Benefits Program under subpart 1 of part L of title 
9
I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets 
10
Act of 1968 (34 U.S.C. 10281 et seq.), but not one 
11
of them for the more than 240 public safety officers 
12
who died by suicide that year. 
13
(8) Public safety officers who have died or are 
14
disabled as a result of suicide or post-traumatic 
15
stress disorder do not qualify for the Public Safety 
16
Officers’ Benefits Program, despite the fact that 
17
public safety officers are more likely to die by sui-
18
cide than from any other line-of-duty cause of death.
