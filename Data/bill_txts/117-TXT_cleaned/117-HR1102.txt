Whereas drug traffickers are using fake or counterfeit pills 
to exploit the opioid crisis and nonmedical use of pre-
scription drugs; 
Whereas the Drug Enforcement Administration (referred to 
in this resolution as the ‘‘DEA’’) has observed a dramatic 
rise in the number of counterfeit pills containing not less 
than 2 milligrams of fentanyl, which is considered a 
deadly dose among people without opioid tolerance; 
Whereas 4 out of every 10 pills with fentanyl tested by the 
DEA contain a potentially lethal dose; 
Whereas counterfeit pills may also contain fentanyl-related 
substances and methamphetamine; 
Whereas the number of counterfeit pills with fentanyl seized 
by law enforcement agencies has increased by nearly 502 
percent since 2019; 
Whereas more than 9,500,000 counterfeit pills were seized 
within the last year, which exceeds the total number of 
seizures for the previous 2 years combined; 
Whereas fake or counterfeit pills have been identified in all 
50 States and the District of Columbia; 
Whereas illicit fentanyl is contaminating other drugs such as 
heroin and cocaine; 
Whereas, for the 12-month period ending in November 2021, 
more than 105,000 individuals in the United States died 
of drug-induced deaths, and 70,000 of those deaths in-
volved illicit synthetic opioids, including fentanyl; 
Whereas, over the last 20 years, drug-induced deaths among 
individuals aged 15 to 35 has increased 6-fold, largely 
driven by the increase in illicit drugs containing fentanyl;

Whereas for the 12-month period ending in April 2021, the 
leading cause of death for individuals in the United 
States aged 18 to 45 was synthetic opioids, including 
fentanyl; 
Whereas racial disparities in rates of fatal opioid-related 
overdoses are increasing, and rates among non-Hispanic 
Black individuals has surpassed rates among non-His-
panic White individuals; 
Whereas counterfeit pills are easily accessible and often sold 
on social media and e-commerce platforms, making them 
accessible to teens and youth; 
Whereas illicit fentanyl is involved in more deaths of youths 
than all other drug types combined; 
Whereas, in 2020, drug overdose and poisoning deaths for in-
dividuals aged 14 to 18 grew by 94 percent, which was 
more than 3 times as fast as the national rate and faster 
than any other 5-year age group; 
Whereas, in 2020, fentanyl-involved drug overdoses and poi-
soning deaths for individuals aged 14 to 18 grew by 169 
percent, which was more than 3 times as fast as the na-
tional rate and faster than any other 5-year age group; 
Whereas it is estimated that fatal overdoses cost the United 
States approximately $1,000,000,000,000 annually; and 
Whereas, in 2020, there were 56,516 reported overdose 
deaths due to synthetic opioids: Now, therefore, be it
