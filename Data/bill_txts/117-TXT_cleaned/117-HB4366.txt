A BILL 
To increase the participation of historically underrepresented 
demographic groups in science, technology, engineering, 
and mathematics education and industry. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Women and Minorities

in STEM Booster Act of 2021’’.

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:

•HR 4366 IH
(1) According to the National Academy of 
1
Sciences, STEM education is critical to ensuring the 
2
United States maintains a diverse and competitive 
3
workforce. 
4
(2) According to the United States Census Bu-
5
reau, women were still vastly underrepresented in 
6
the STEM workforce in 2019: comprising nearly 
7
half of the United States workforce (48 percent), 
8
but only slightly more than a quarter of STEM 
9
workers (27 percent). 
10
(3) According to the National Science Founda-
11
tion, women only represent 28 percent of all science 
12
and engineering workers: comprising 29 percent of 
13
physical scientists, 25 percent of computer and 
14
mathematical scientists, and 13 percent of engineers. 
15
(4) According to the National Center of Edu-
16
cation Statistics (NCES), women are more likely 
17
than men to switch out of STEM majors: 32 per-
18
cent, compared to 26 percent. NCES has also found 
19
that while a higher percentage of bachelor’s degrees 
20
are awarded to females than males (58 percent, 
21
compared to 42 percent), within STEM fields a 
22
lower percentage of bachelor’s degrees were awarded 
23
to females than males (36 percent, compared to 64 
24
percent).

(5) According to the National Action Council 
1
for Minorities in Engineering, Inc., the United 
2
States needs to increase the number of underrep-
3
resented minorities who become engineers in order 
4
to remain competitive in a world of technological in-
5
novation. 
6
(6) According to Asian Americans Advancing 
7
Justice (AAJC), data on Asian Americans and Pa-
8
cific Islanders (AAPIs) tend to hide the fact that 
9
certain AAPI subgroups are still underrepresented 
10
in STEM: with Cambodian (9 percent), Laotian (8 
11
percent), Hmong (8 percent), and Native Hawaiian 
12
and Pacific Islander (7 percent) workers signifi-
13
cantly underrepresented compared to other workers 
14
in the United States (12 percent). 
15
(7) Data also tend to hide the fact that certain 
16
subgroups are underrepresented in postsecondary 
17
education: with Cambodian (18 percent), Hmong (17 
18
percent), Laotian (16 percent), and Native Hawaiian 
19
and Pacific Islander (15 percent) students receiving 
20
a bachelor’s degree or higher at lower rates than 
21
other students (30 percent). Furthermore, certain 
22
subgroups also experience poverty at higher rates: 
23
with Hmong (28 percent), Cambodian (21 percent), 
24
Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders (20 percent), 
25

and Laotian (17 percent) households living below the 
1
Federal poverty level at significantly higher rates 
2
than the overall population (15 percent). 
3
(8) Finally, NCES has found that women and 
4
underrepresented minorities leave STEM at higher 
5
rates than their counterparts, leading to a need to 
6
develop resources to retain these groups in STEM.

(b) PROGRAM AUTHORIZED.—The Director of the 
8
National Science Foundation shall award grants to eligible 
9
entities, on a competitive basis, to enable such eligible en-
10
tities to carry out the activities described in subsection (d), 
11
in order to increase the participation of women and under-
12
represented minorities in the fields of science, technology, 
13
engineering, and mathematics. 
14
(c) APPLICATION.—Each eligible entity that desires 
15
to receive a grant under this section shall submit an appli-
16
cation to the National Science Foundation at such time, 
17
in such manner, and containing such information as the 
18
Director of the National Science Foundation may reason-
19
ably require. 
20
(d) AUTHORIZED ACTIVITIES.—An eligible entity
