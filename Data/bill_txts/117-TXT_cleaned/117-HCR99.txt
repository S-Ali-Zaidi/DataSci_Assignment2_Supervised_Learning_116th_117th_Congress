has been very clear about its ambitions in the South

ticipation in Hong Kong violates the PRC’s commitments

Hong Kong’s long tradition of economic and democratic 
freedoms for 50 years, beginning on July 1, 1997; 
Whereas the Beijing government’s increasingly hostile actions

tactics; 
Whereas the PRC routinely pressures United States compa-
nies entering its market to cede their intellectual property

nonprofit organizations, and average citizens; and
