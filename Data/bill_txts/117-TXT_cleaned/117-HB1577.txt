•HR 1577 IH
(1) According to the Centers for Disease Con-
1
trol and Prevention, about 41 percent of adults aged 
2
60 and over had obesity in the period of 2015 
3
through 2016, representing more than 27 million 
4
people. 
5
(2) The National Institutes of Health has re-
6
ported that obesity and overweight are now the sec-
7
ond leading cause of death nationally, with an esti-
8
mated 300,000 deaths a year attributed to the epi-
9
demic. 
10
(3) Obesity increases the risk for chronic dis-
11
eases and conditions, including high blood pressure, 
12
heart disease, certain cancers, arthritis, mental ill-
13
ness, lipid disorders, sleep apnea, and type 2 diabe-
14
tes. 
15
(4) More than half of Medicare beneficiaries are 
16
treated for 5 or more chronic conditions per year. 
17
The rate of obesity among Medicare beneficiaries 
18
doubled from 1987 to 2002 and nearly doubled 
19
again by 2016, with Medicare spending on individ-
20
uals with obesity during that time rising proportion-
21
ately to reach $50 billion in 2014. 
22
(5) Men and women with obesity at age 65 have 
23
decreased life expectancy of 1.6 years for men and 
24
1.4 years for women.

(6) The direct and indirect cost of obesity was 
1
more than $427.8 billion in 2014 and is growing. 
2
(7) On average, a Medicare beneficiary with 
3
obesity costs $2,018 (in 2019 dollars) more than a 
4
healthy-weight beneficiary. 
5
(8) The prevalence of obesity among older indi-
6
viduals in the United States is growing at a linear 
7
rate and, if nothing changes, nearly one in two 
8
(47%) Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 and over will 
9
have obesity in 2030, up from slightly more than 
10
one in four (28%) in 2010.
