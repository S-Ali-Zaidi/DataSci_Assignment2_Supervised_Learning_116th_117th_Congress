A BILL 
To support research and state management efforts on chronic 
wasting disease. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Chronic Wasting Dis-
4
ease Research and Management Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Chronic wasting disease, the fatal neuro-
8
logical disease found in cervids, is a fundamental 
9
threat to the health and vibrancy of deer, elk, and 
10
moose populations, and the increased occurrence of

•HR 5608 IH
chronic wasting disease in regionally diverse loca-
1
tions necessitates an escalation in research, surveil-
2
lance, monitoring, and management activities fo-
3
cused on containing and managing chronic wasting 
4
disease. 
5
(2) A focus on research into the transmission 
6
of, resistance to, diagnosis of, and epidemiology of 
7
chronic wasting disease is needed to inform future 
8
policies to combat the disease and ensure the health 
9
of cervid populations. 
10
(3) Because States and Tribes have diverse 
11
policies for addressing chronic wasting disease, the 
12
Federal Government, in consultation with the 
13
Chronic Wasting Disease Task Force established by 
14
section 104 of America’s Conservation Enhancement 
15
Act (Public Law 116–188), should coordinate finan-
16
cial and technical support to States and Tribes, 
17
State and Tribal departments of agriculture, State 
18
and Tribal wildlife agencies, institutions of higher 
19
education, and research centers conducting scientific 
20
research on chronic wasting disease. 
21
(4) Pursuant to State and Federal law, the 
22
States retain primacy and policymaking authority 
23
with regard to wildlife management.

•HR 5608 IH
(5) Under current policies, chronic wasting dis-
1
ease remains a systemic threat to cervids. 
2
(6) Scientific advances that lead to the ability 
3
to stop transmission of chronic wasting disease are 
4
needed to ensure the long-term viability of cervids.
