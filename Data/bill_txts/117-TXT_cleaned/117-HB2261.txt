•HR 2261 IH
(1) Young Oak Kim was born in Los Angeles 
1
in 1919 to Korean American immigrants, where his 
2
family faced numerous challenges. After high school, 
3
Kim enrolled in Los Angeles City College, but 
4
dropped out after a year to find work to help sup-
5
port his family. 
6
(2) Because of racial discrimination, Kim strug-
7
gled to keep employed. With the outbreak of World 
8
War II (WWII), Kim tried to enlist in the United 
9
States Army, but that opportunity was closed off to 
10
him, too, as an Asian American. However, after 
11
Congress extended conscription to Asian Americans, 
12
Kim was drafted into the Army, entering the service 
13
on January 31, 1941. 
14
(3) From the earliest days of Kim’s service in 
15
the United States Army, he distinguished himself as 
16
a leader, being selected for the Infantry Officer Can-
17
didate School at Fort Benning, Georgia. Upon his 
18
commission as a second lieutenant in 1943, Kim was 
19
assigned to the all-Japanese American 100th Infan-
20
try Battalion/442nd Regimental Combat Team. 
21
(4) Young Oak Kim was assigned as an officer 
22
of the 100th Infantry Battalion that was formed on 
23
June 5, 1942, comprised of predominantly second- 
24

•HR 2261 IH
generation Americans of Japanese ancestry from the 
1
Hawaiian Islands. 
2
(5) When Kim reported to duty, his com-
3
manding officer gave Kim the option to transfer due 
4
to the historical conflicts between the Japanese and 
5
Koreans, but Kim stated, ‘‘Sir, they’re Americans 
6
and I am an American. And we’re going to fight for 
7
America.’’. 
8
(6) The 100th Infantry Battalion was deployed 
9
to the Mediterranean and entered combat in Italy on 
10
September 26, 1943. The 100th Battalion fought at 
11
Cassino, Italy in January 1944, and later accom-
12
panied the 34th Infantry Division to Anzio, Italy. 
13
(7) Kim’s most notable feat occurred at the 
14
Battle of Anzio, during broad daylight he volun-
15
teered to capture German soldiers for intelligence in-
16
formation. He and another soldier crawled more 
17
than 600 yards located directly under German obser-
18
vation posts with no cover. They captured two pris-
19
oners and obtained information that significantly 
20
contributed to the fall of Rome. For his actions, Kim 
21
received the Distinguished Service Cross from the 
22
United States and the Military Valor Cross, the 
23
highest military decoration in Italy.

(8) The 100th Infantry Battalion was formally 
1
made an integral part of the 442nd Regimental 
2
Combat Team on June 15, 1944, and fought for the 
3
last 11 months of the war with distinction in Italy, 
4
southern France, and Germany. The 442nd Regi-
5
mental Team became the most decorated unit in 
6
United States military history for its size and length 
7
of service. The 100th Battalion and the 442nd Regi-
8
mental Combat Team, received 7 Presidential Unit 
9
Citations, 21 Medals of Honor, 29 Distinguished 
10
Service Crosses, 560 Silver Stars, 4,000 Bronze 
11
Stars, 22 Legion of Merit Medals, 15 Soldier’s Med-
12
als, and over 4,000 Purple Hearts, among numerous 
13
additional distinctions. 
14
(9) When the Korean war broke out in 1950, 
15
Kim rejoined the United States Army and partici-
16
pated in the United Nations Forces’ last drive into 
17
Korea. As commander of the First Battalion, 31st 
18
Infantry Regiment, he became the first officer of 
19
color in United States history to command an Army 
20
battalion on the battlefield. 
21
(10) In Seoul, he led his battalion in sponsoring 
22
an orphanage of more than 500 children. The bat-
23
talion was the only United Nations military unit to 
24
sponsor an orphanage during the war.

(11) In 1972, Kim retired from the Army at 
1
the rank of Colonel. By the end of his career, Kim 
2
had earned the Distinguished Service Cross, two Sil-
3
ver Stars, two Bronze Stars, three Purple Hearts, 
4
two Legions of Merit, and several military com-
5
mendations from foreign governments-Italy’s Bronze 
6
Medal of Military Valor and Military Valor Cross, 
7
France’s La Legion D’Honneur, and the Republic of 
8
Korea’s Taeguk Order of Military Merit. 
9
(12) Kim returned to his native Los Angeles 
10
and became a civic leader. In 1975, he established 
11
the Koreatown Youth and Community Center in Los 
12
Angeles to support recently immigrated Korean 
13
youth who were struggling with poverty and lan-
14
guage barriers, which today serves a broad multi- 
15
ethnic population of 11,000 people in the greater 
16
Los Angeles area. 
17
(13) In 1978, Kim helped establish the Center 
18
for the Pacific Asian Family (CPAF), an organiza-
19
tion providing culturally and linguistically appro-
20
priate domestic violence and sexual assault services 
21
to the pan-Asian immigrant community. Under his 
22
leadership as CPAF’s chairman, the organization be-
23
came the largest women’s shelter in Southern Cali-
24
fornia in the 1990s.

2
(KHEIR), a nonprofit service agency providing cul-
3
turally and linguistically-sensitive health care and 
4
human services to the uninsured and underserved 
5
residents of Los Angeles. Today KHEIR operates 
6
two clinics that can accommodate more than 75,000 
7
patient visits annually and is the only federally 
8
qualified health center in the United States that 
9
serves a majority Korean patient base, with all serv-
10
ices available in English, Korean, and Spanish. 
11
(15) In 1985, Kim co-founded the Japanese 
12
American National Museum (JANM), which pro-
13
motes understanding and appreciation of America’s 
14
ethnic and cultural diversity by sharing the Japa-
15
nese American experience. 
16
(16) In 1989, Kim founded and served as the 
17
Chairman of the 100th/442nd/MIS WWII Memorial 
18
Foundation, which is now known as the Go for
