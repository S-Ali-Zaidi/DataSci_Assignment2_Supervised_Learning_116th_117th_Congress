SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress makes the following findings: 
2
(1) Since the 2009 military coup, the Republic 
3
of Honduras remains plagued by systemic corruption 
4
and human rights violations, exemplified by— 
5
(A) widespread collusion among govern-
6
ment officials, state and private security forces, 
7
organized crime, and members of the private 
8
sector, including in the knowledge and perpetra-
9
tion of physical and legal threats, assassina-
10
tions, forced disappearances, and other abuses 
11
against human rights and environmental de-
12
fenders, members of the political opposition, 
13
journalists, and others; 
14
(B) the excessive use of force by members 
15
of the police or military of the Republic of Hon-
16
duras, particularly in the context of civil society 
17
protests; 
18
(C) the failure of the Government of Hon-
19
duras to protect the rights, interests, and phys-
20
ical security of indigenous peoples in land and 
21
natural resources disputes, in contravention of 
22
its obligations under the Honduran constitution 
23
and under international treaties to which it is 
24
a state party; and 
25
22:16 Jun 07, 2021
H2716

•HR 2716 IH
(D) the failure of the Government of Hon-
1
duras to enforce the Honduran Labor Code in 
2
violation of its obligations under International 
3
Labor Organization Conventions, which the 
4
Government of Honduras has ratified, guaran-
5
teeing freedom of association, the right to col-
6
lective bargaining, and other fundamental labor 
7
protections. 
8
(2) There is substantial evidence that President 
9
of Honduras Juan Orlando Herna´ndez has engaged 
10
in a pattern of criminal activity and use of the state 
11
apparatus to protect and facilitate drug trafficking, 
12
as exemplified by three high-profile corruption and 
13
drug trafficking cases that were tried or are being 
14
prosecuted in the United States District Court for 
15
the Southern District of New York, in which the 
16
President of Honduras was named as a co-con-
17
spirator, including the following: 
18
(A) The October 2019 conviction of the 
19
President of Honduras’s brother Juan Antonio 
20
Herna´ndez, in which Federal prosecutors and 
21
multiple witnesses testified that the President 
22
of Honduras received $1,500,000 in drug pro-
23
ceeds that were funneled toward his successful 
24
2013 presidential campaign, and that organized

crime had infiltrated the Honduran National 
1
Police and National Party. 
2
(B) The March 2020 indictment of 
3
Geovanny Daniel Fuentes, a drug trafficker, in 
4
which Federal prosecutors alleged that the 
5
President of Honduras accepted $25,000 in 
6
bribes in exchange for protecting the defendant 
7
from law enforcement intervention against his 
8
cocaine trafficking activities and facilitated the 
9
use of Honduran military personnel as security 
10
for the defendant’s drug trafficking operations. 
11
On February 5, 2021, Federal prosecutors filed 
12
a court document stating that the President of 
13
Honduras was under investigation in connection 
14
with the case. 
15
(C) The April 2020 indictment of former 
16
National Director of Police Juan Carlos ‘‘El 
17
Tigre’’ Bonilla, in which Federal prosecutors al-
18
leged that the President of Honduras accepted 
19
bribes from drug traffickers, facilitated multi- 
20
ton shipments of cocaine bound for the United 
21
States, and entrusted the defendant with spe-
22
cial assignments, including murder.

(3) The President of Honduras has also dem-
1
onstrated a track record of contempt for the rule of 
2
law, exhibited by— 
3
(A) his support for the 2009 military coup, 
4
repudiated as unlawful by the United Nations, 
5
the Organization of American States, the Euro-
6
pean Union, and numerous foreign govern-
7
ments, while a member of Congress; 
8
(B) his support for a 2012 congressional 
9
measure, widely viewed as illegal, to replace 
10
four Supreme Court justices while the leader of 
11
Congress; and 
12
(C) his 2017 candidacy for a second presi-
13
dential term, in violation of the Honduran con-
14
stitution’s longstanding prohibition on presi-
15
dential reelection, which in 2015 was nullified 
16
in a ruling by the justices referred to in sub-
17
paragraph (B). 
18
(4) In recent months, the executive and legisla-
19
tive branches of the Government of Honduras have 
20
taken significant steps to entrench corruption, block 
21
oversight by national prosecutors and international 
22
investigators, and shield senior officials and parlia-
23
mentarians from criminal liability, including the fol-
24
lowing actions: 
25
22:16 Jun 07, 2021
H2716
7 
•HR 2716 IH
(A) On January 19, 2020, the Government 
1
of Honduras announced the closing of the Mis-
2
sion of Support against Corruption and Impu-
3
nity in Honduras (MACCIH), the anti-corrup-
4
tion mechanism established in 2015 by the Or-
5
ganization of American States and the Govern-
6
ment of Honduras. MACCIH brought 14 cor-
7
ruption-related cases against dozens of high- 
8
profile criminal defendants and oversaw the cre-
9
ation of an anti-corruption judicial circuit and 
10
special prosecutor’s unit that was disbanded fol-
11
lowing the mission’s closure. 
12
(B) On June 25, 2020, the Government of 
13
Honduras enacted a new penal code that re-
14
duced prison terms for corruption-related 
15
crimes, including embezzlement, illicit enrich-
16
ment, obstruction of justice, and fraud. The 
17
measure is retroactive, benefitting Honduran 
18
officials already convicted or facing prosecution. 
19
(C) On October 16, 2019, the National 
20
Congress of Honduras passed a law that re-
21
stored immunity to all parliamentarians for 
22
crimes related to legislative activities and a law 
23
that blocked the Attorney General’s office from

investigating cases involving the improper use 
1
of state funds for up to 7 years. 
2
(5) These recent measures follow a longer pat-
3
tern of congressional decrees of amnesty or immu-
4
nity for crimes perpetrated by authorities in Hon-
5
duras, including for those committed during the 
6
2009 coup and its aftermath, those perpetrated by 
7
state security forces, and those involving the misuse 
8
of public funds by former and current legislators, 
9
contributing to a climate of impunity. 
10
(6) Space for civil society to operate in the Re-
11
public of Honduras remains severely constrained, 
12
with rights activists and journalists subject to acute 
13
levels of violence, surveillance, harassment, and in-
14
timidation. The Republic of Honduras ranks as the 
15
deadliest country in the world for human rights and 
16
environmental defenders on a per capita basis and 
17
third in the number of assassinations, with 31 de-
18
fenders killed in 2019 and 204 defenders killed since 
19
2009. 
20
(7) The 2019 United States Department of 
21
State Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, 
22
international human rights bodies, and numerous 
23
monitoring groups have reported that the Honduran 
24
police and military commit human rights violations

with impunity, including unlawful killings, torture, 
1
and the use of unnecessary force and lethal weapons 
2
against protestors and civilian bystanders. Individ-
3
uals with documented records of human rights viola-
4
tions and links to drug trafficking continue to serve 
5
in high-ranking positions within the Honduran police 
6
and military, and few of the alleged cases of human 
7
rights abuses perpetrated by police and military per-
8
sonnel are prosecuted or tried in court. 
9
(8) The Office of the United Nations High 
10
Commissioner for Human Rights and the Inter- 
11
American Commission on Human Rights have docu-
12
mented the use of arbitrary detentions, forced dis-
13
appearances, and specious judicial proceedings to 
14
criminalize indigenous and human rights activists, 
15
environmental defenders, journalists, opposition poli-
16
ticians, and others, including— 
17
(A) members of the Tocoa Municipal Com-
18
mittee for the Defense of Common and Public 
19
Assets, who since September 2019 have been 
20
detained pending trial following their protest of 
21
an illegal mining concession affecting the 
22
Guapinol and San Pedro rivers;

(B) four Afro-indigenous Garı´funa land de-
24

4
(C) opposition lawmaker Marı´a Luisa 
5
Borjas, who on July 21, 2020, was convicted of 
6
defamation and sentenced to nearly three years 
7
in prison for naming Ficohsa bank president 
8
Camilo Atala as an intellectual author of the 
9
2016 assassination of environmental and indige-
10
nous rights activist Berta Ca´ceres. 
11
(9) The vilification and criminalization of civil 
12
society actors and human rights defenders by Hon-
13
duran authorities has continued unabated under the 
14
cover of COVID–19 pandemic response. On March 
15
16, 2020, the Government of Honduras first notified 
16
the Organization of American States of its deroga-
17
tion from treaty obligations under the American 
18
Convention on Human Rights and has since sus-
19
pended nine constitutional guarantees, including the 
20
rights to freedom of assembly and expression, the 
21
latter of which was restored after international out-
22
cry. At least 34,000 citizens have been detained for 
23
violating curfew and lockdown restrictions, and jour-
24
nalists and human rights defenders have been im-
