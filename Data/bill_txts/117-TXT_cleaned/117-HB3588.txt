SEC. 2. MATHEMATICAL AND STATISTICAL MODELING EDU-
1
CATION. 
2
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
3
(1) The mathematics taught in schools, includ-
4
ing statistical problem solving and data science, is 
5
not keeping pace with the rapidly evolving needs of 
6
the public and private sector, resulting in a STEM 
7
skills shortage and employers needing to expend re-
8
sources to train and upskill employees. 
9
(2) According to the Bureau of Labor Statis-
10
tics, the United States will need 1,000,000 addi-
11
tional STEM professionals than it is on track to 
12
produce in the coming decade. 
13
(3) The field of data science, which is relevant 
14
in almost every workplace, relies on the ability to 
15
work in teams and use computational tools to do 
16
mathematical and statistical problem solving. 
17
(4) Many STEM occupations offer higher 
18
wages, more opportunities for advancement, and a 
19
higher degree of job security than non-STEM jobs. 
20
(5) The STEM workforce relies on computa-
21
tional and data-driven discovery, decision making, 
22
and predictions, from models that often must quan-
23
tify uncertainty, as in weather predictions, spread of 
24
disease, or financial forecasting.

(6) Most fields, including analytics, science, eco-
1
nomics, publishing, marketing, actuarial science, op-
2
erations research, engineering, and medicine, require 
3
data savvy, including the ability to select reliable 
4
sources of data, identify and remove errors in data, 
5
recognize and quantify uncertainty in data, visualize 
6
and analyze data, and use data to develop under-
7
standing or make predictions. 
8
(7) Rapidly emerging fields, such as artificial 
9
intelligence, machine learning, quantum computing 
10
and quantum information, all rely on mathematical 
11
and statistical concepts, which are critical to prove 
12
under what circumstances an algorithm or experi-
13
ment will work and when it will fail. 
14
(8) Military academies have a long tradition in 
15
teaching mathematical modeling and would benefit 
16
from the ability to recruit students with this exper-
17
tise from their other school experiences. 
18
(9) Mathematical modeling has been a strong 
19
educational priority globally, especially in China, 
20
where participation in United States mathematical 
21
modeling challenges in high school and higher edu-
22
cation is orders of magnitude higher than in the 
23
United States, and Chinese teams are taking a ma-
24
jority of the prizes.

(10) Girls participate in mathematical modeling 
1
challenges at all levels at similar levels as boys, while 
2
in traditional mathematical competitions girls par-
3
ticipate less and drop out at every stage. Students 
4
cite opportunity for teamwork, using mathematics 
5
and statistics in meaningful contexts, ability to use 
6
computation, and emphasis on communication as 
7
reasons for continued participation in modeling chal-
8
lenges.
