SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Domestic violence is a serious public health 
3
problem and more than 10 million individuals expe-
4
rience domestic violence in the United States each 
5
year. 
6
(2) According to the National Intimate Partner 
7
and Sexual Violence Survey in the United States— 
8
(A) more than 1 in 4 women and nearly 1 
9
in 10 men will experience contact sexual vio-
10
lence, physical violence, or stalking by an inti-
11
mate partner and experience an intimate part-
12
ner violence related impact in their lifetime; and 
13
(B) approximately 1 in 4 women and 1 in 
14
7 men experience severe physical violence by an 
15
intimate partner in their lifetime. 
16
(3) More than half of female homicides are con-
17
nected to intimate partner violence and in a domes-
18
tic violence situation the presence of a gun increases 
19
the risk of homicide by 500 percent. 
20
(4) While domestic violence can affect anyone, 
21
research indicates that communities of color, individ-
22
uals with disabilities, LGBTQ+ individuals, and 
23
other marginalized communities can be dispropor-
24
tionately impacted.

(5) Domestic violence leads to the loss of nearly 
1
8 million days of work each year the lifetime eco-
2
nomic burden on victims is $3.6 trillion, in which the 
3
government pays approximately $1.3 trillion (37 per-
4
cent) of the burden. 
5
(6) The United Nations has urged countries to 
6
adopt national action plans to combat gender-based 
7
violence and violence against women, including do-
8
mestic violence, and approximately 50 countries, in-
9
cluding Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, 
10
Germany, Spain, and Ireland, have adopted such 
11
plans. 
12
(7) The United States does not have a national 
13
plan of action on domestic violence or gender-based 
14
violence, making it a global outlier. 
15
(8) While the Violence Against Women Act 
16
(VAWA) enacted in 1984 and the Family Violence 
17
Prevention and Services Act (FVPSA) enacted in 
18
1995 are the United States landmark pieces of do-
19
mestic violence legislation and have many of the 
20
hallmarks of a national action plan on domestic vio-
21
lence prevention, from the public health and the en-
22
forcement perspectives, respectively, the United 
23
States does not have a whole-of-government, goal- 
24
oriented, community-informed, forward-looking na-

tional plan of action for domestic violence preven-
1
tion. 
2
(9) In 1995, the Office on Violence Against 
3
Women (OVW) was created within the Department 
4
of Justice (DOJ) to administer grants authorized 
5
under VAWA and offer financial and technical as-
6
sistance to communities across the United States 
7
that are working to develop and maintain programs, 
8
policies, and practices geared towards responding to 
9
domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, 
10
and stalking. 
11
(10) In 2002, OVW was codified through Title 
12
IV of the 21st Century Department of Justice Ap-
13
propriations Act (Public Law 107–273). 
14
(11) The FVPSA is the primary Federal re-
15
source dedicated to the provision of domestic vio-
16
lence shelters, supportive services, and related pro-
17
gramming for victims of domestic/dating violence 
18
and their dependents. 
19
(12) The FVPSA Program administers State 
20
and Territorial Formula Grants, Native American 
21
Tribes Formula Grants, State and Territory Domes-
22
tic Violence Coalitions Grants, Discretionary Grants, 
23
Specialized Services to Abused Parents and their 
24
Children, Training and Technical Assistance Re-

source Centers Grants, and the National Domestic 
1
Violence Hotline Grant. The FVPSA authorizes 4 
2
major activities that: 
3
(A) Assist States and Tribes in efforts to 
4
prevent domestic violence and dating violence. 
5
(B) Provide immediate shelter and sup-
6
portive services for victims of domestic violence 
7
and their dependents. 
8
(C) Provide for a National Domestic Vio-
9
lence Hotline. 
10
(D) Provide for technical assistance and 
11
training relating to domestic violence and do-
12
mestic violence programs to States, Tribes, pub-
13
lic agencies, community-based programs and 
14
the public. 
15
(13) Since 1996, the Centers for Disease Con-
16
trol and Prevention (CDC) has awarded DELTA 
17
funding to State Domestic Violence Coalitions 
18
(SDVCs) to coordinate specific prevention activities. 
19
(14) Overall approximately 18 States have re-
20
ceived DELTA funding at some point since the pro-
21
grams creation. However, only nine States currently 
22
benefit from this funding. 
23
(15) According to the CDC, DELTA focuses on 
24
implementing three strategies with the goal of ad-

dressing and decreasing community and societal 
1
level risk, identifying factors in communities that 
2
may lead to intimate partner violence and increasing 
3
protective factors that prevent it by— 
4
(A) engaging influential adults and peers; 
5
(B) creating protective environments; and 
6
(C) strengthening economic supports for 
7
families. 
8
(16) In 1993, the FVPSA established 4 na-
9
tional training and technical assistance resource cen-
10
ters to support, train, and assist domestic violence 
11
shelters, community-based organizations, victim ad-
12
vocates, and other professionals in the provision of 
13
safe housing and supportive services to domestic vio-
14
lence survivors and their dependents. These resource 
15
centers include the National Resource Center on Do-
16
mestic Violence (NRCDV), the Health Resource 
17
Center on Domestic Violence, the Resource Center 
18
on Domestic Violence: Child Protection and Custody, 
19
and the Battered Women’s Justice Project (BWJP). 
20
In later years, additional resource centers were es-
21
tablished to focus on culturally specific populations, 
22
Tribes and sovereign nations, American Indian/Alas-
23
ka Natives, children exposed to domestic violence, 
24
mental and behavioral health services, housing,

LGBTQ services, and other critical service intersec-
1
tions to meet the needs of survivors. With respect to 
2
these resource centers: 
3
(A) The purpose of these resource centers, 
4
known collectively as the Domestic Violence Re-
5
source Network (DVRN), is to engage in indi-
6
vidual and collective strategic action to advance 
7
public policy, institutional change, community 
8
responses, and prevention initiatives that inte-
9
grate and respond to the diverse realities and 
10
needs of survivors, their families, and their 
11
communities. 
12
(B) The individual advocacy efforts of 
13
DVRN members are informed by the wide 
14
range of expertise within the network and 
15
strengthened by opportunities for critical think-
16
ing and robust discussion of cross-cutting policy 
17
and practice issues. 
18
(C) In 2021, the FVPSA provides funding 
19
for two national resource centers, four special 
20
issue resource centers, three culturally specific 
21
resource centers, five emerging issue resource 
22
centers, one statewide Alaska Native resource 
23
center, and the National Domestic Violence 
24

(17) Many Federal agencies respond to domes-
6
tic violence by providing formula-based and discre-
7
tionary grants to local, State, and Tribal govern-
8
ments, courts, nonprofits organizations, community-

(18) Survivors of domestic violence are affected 
16
by the programs of all Federal agencies, even if 
17
those agencies have not currently put into place spe-
18
cific programs to support survivors. 
19
(19) Responses to domestic violence have fo-
20
cused, to date, primarily on intervention after the 
21
problem has already been identified and harm has 
22
occurred. However, there are prevention strategies 
23
and prevention approaches from the public health 
24
field that can serve as models for further develop-

ment of domestic violence prevention, such as a pub-
1
lic health campaign that identifies and addresses the 
2
underlying causes of the issues. 
3
(20) Domestic violence prevention should be ad-
4
dressed along a continuum of possible harm: 
5
(A) Primary prevention to reduce the inci-
6
dence of domestic violence before it occurs. 
7
(B) Secondary prevention to decrease the 
8
prevalence of domestic violence after early signs 
9
of such violence. 
10
(C) Tertiary prevention to intervene once 
11
domestic violence is already clearly evident and 
12
causing harm. 
13
(21) Early evaluations of existing prevention 
14
programs show promise, but results are still prelimi-
15
nary and programs remain small, locally based, and 
16
scattered throughout the United States. 
17
(22) The United States needs a broadly based, 
18
comprehensive prevention strategy that is supported 
19
by sound research and evaluation, receives adequate 
20
public backing, and is based on a policy of zero tol-
21
erance for domestic violence.
