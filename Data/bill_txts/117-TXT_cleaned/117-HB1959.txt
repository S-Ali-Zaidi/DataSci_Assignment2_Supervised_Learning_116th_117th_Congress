SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
1
The Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) When American author, Mark Twain, im-
3
mortalized Helen Keller’s teacher, Anne Sullivan 
4
Macy, with the moniker ‘‘the miracle worker’’, his 
5
words, though meant as praise, reflect the mis-
6
conception that educating individuals with disabil-
7
ities is a nearly insurmountable task requiring ex-
8
traordinary feats performed by gifted and saintly 
9
persons. Rather, the work of teaching children with 
10
disabilities can and does occur when committed and 
11
qualified but everyday special educators are properly 
12
prepared and supported to practice their professions. 
13
Yet, the educational systems within which they act 
14
must also be held accountable for results. 
15
(2) In 1817, Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet and a 
16
deaf teacher, Laurent Clerc, opened the first Amer-
17
ican school for deaf students—the American School 
18
for the Deaf—with young Alice Cogswell as its first 
19
pupil. Ultimately the school grew into a national in-
20
stitution and the mother of many other schools. As 
21
Alice demonstrated, deaf and hard of hearing chil-
22
dren can learn and achieve to high levels when they 
23
have full access to language and communication; are 
24
taught by professionals with specialized training; 
25
and have access to educational placements that rec-
26
21:10 May 15, 2021
H1959
6 
•HR 1959 IH
ognize and provide for their language, communica-
1
tion, social-emotional, and academic needs. 
2
(3) Deaf and hard of hearing children who are 
3
identified early and receive appropriate early inter-
4
vention from specialized, qualified providers achieve 
5
higher language and communication outcomes. How-
6
ever, currently, early intervention services typically 
7
are not provided in a timely manner and severe 
8
shortages of specialized early intervention profes-
9
sionals result in many deaf and hard of hearing chil-
10
dren not reaching their developmental potential. 
11
Similarly, research demonstrates that students with 
12
visual disabilities are among the highest performing 
13
students with disabilities in terms of academic 
14
achievement, and yet they are among the least em-
15
ployed, even after successful accomplishment of post- 
16
secondary academic objectives. 
17
(4) Likewise, children who are deaf-blind have 
18
the same capacity to learn and achieve as any other 
19
children. However, they must have ongoing access to 
20
the same environmental and educational information 
21
that their sighted and hearing peers can access auto-
22
matically. These children require direct learning ex-
23
periences, including hands-on experiences and in-
24
tense involvement in educational routines and activi-
25
21:10 May 15, 2021
H1959

•HR 1959 IH
ties. They must receive specialized direct instruction 
1
in their preferred mode of communication in a range 
2
of academic and functional areas. 
3
(5) Students who are deaf, hard of hearing, or 
4
deaf-blind require more language and communica-
5
tion access and support to acquire skills than they 
6
are currently receiving. It has been the U.S. Depart-
7
ment of Education’s position since 1992 that ‘‘[a]ny 
8
educational setting that does not meet the commu-
9
nication and related needs of a child who is deaf 
10
does not allow for the provision of [a Free Appro-
11
priate Public Education] and cannot be considered 
12
the [Least Restrictive Environment] for that child’’. 
13
(6) Moreover, a principal way that sighted, 
14
hearing students acquire knowledge and skills is 
15
through incidental learning, naturally observing oth-
16
ers and the environment. Deficits in incidental learn-
17
ing leave students with sensory disabilities behind in 
18
an array of skill areas. In addition to core aca-
19
demics, deaf and hard of hearing students, for exam-
20
ple, must also receive specialized instruction and 
21
services designed to maximize their capacity to learn 
22
effectively and live productively and independently. 
23
Similarly, students who are blind or visually im-
24
paired must also receive instruction in the expanded 
25
21:10 May 15, 2021
H1959
8 
•HR 1959 IH
core curriculum, a comprehensive array of special-
1
ized instruction and services maximizing the capacity 
2
of students with visual disabilities to learn effectively 
3
and live productively and independently. 
4
(7) The widespread use by States of Individuals 
5
with Disabilities Education Act’s disability cat-
6
egories has led to a sizable undercount of students 
7
with sensory disabilities and, consequently, a lack of 
8
recognition of the extent of the systemic need for the 
9
delivery of appropriate instructional services meeting 
10
their unique needs. This occurs in large measure be-
11
cause students with sensory disabilities who also 
12
have additional disabilities are frequently formally 
13
classified as having multiple disabilities. Con-
14
sequently, their vision, hearing, or concomitant vi-
15
sion and hearing disabilities and related support 
16
needs are not fully acknowledged. 
17
(8) Children who are deaf-blind should receive 
18
one-to-one services from interveners, who have train-
19
ing 
and 
specialized 
skills 
in 
deaf-blindness. 
20
Interveners play a critical role in the provision of a 
21
Free and Appropriate Public Education, because 
22
they provide access to the information these children 
23
need in order to learn and develop concepts, to facili-
24
tate their communication development and inter-
25

actions in their preferred mode of communication, 
1
and to promote their social and emotional well-being. 
2
(9) A national resource in visual disabilities is 
3
needed to supplement the work of State and local 
4
educational agencies through student enrichment ac-
5
tivities; to support teachers of students with visual 
6
impairments and related services personnel through 
7
state-of-the-art continuing education opportunities; 
8
and to spur the further advancement of instructional 
9
services for students with visual disabilities through 
10
scientific research and evidence-based best practices.
