•HR 5975 IH
(1) The Bureau of Prisons has 122 institutions 
1
located throughout the United States. The Bureau 
2
of Prisons employs nearly 38,000 employees and is 
3
responsible for more than 150,000 Federal inmates. 
4
(2) Video footage from security camera systems 
5
and reliable communication over radio systems with-
6
in Bureau of Prisons institutions are essential to 
7
protecting the health and safety of Bureau of Pris-
8
ons employees and Federal inmates. 
9
(3) Based on the experience of Bureau of Pris-
10
ons correctional staff, the noticeable presence of 
11
functioning security cameras serves as an effective 
12
deterrent to criminal behavior and misconduct. 
13
(4) Well-documented deficiencies of camera sys-
14
tems at Bureau of Prisons’ facilities have hindered 
15
investigators’ ability to substantiate allegations of 
16
serious misconduct by staff and inmates, including 
17
sexual and physical assaults, medical neglect, and in-
18
troduction of contraband. 
19
(5) In a 2016 report, the Office of the Inspec-
20
tor General for the Department of Justice deter-
21
mined that ‘‘deficiencies within the BOP’s security 
22
camera system have affected the OIG’s ability to se-
23
cure prosecutions of staff and inmates in BOP con-
24
traband introduction cases, and these same problems

adversely impact the availability of critical evidence 
1
to support administrative or disciplinary action 
2
against staff and inmates’’. 
3
(6) Shortcomings in the land-mobile radio sys-
4
tems at Bureau of Prison facilities institutions im-
5
pede the communication abilities of staff, slowing or 
6
preventing the response of correctional officers dur-
7
ing an emergency or threat of attack, and jeopard-
8
izing the safety of both staff and Federal inmates.
