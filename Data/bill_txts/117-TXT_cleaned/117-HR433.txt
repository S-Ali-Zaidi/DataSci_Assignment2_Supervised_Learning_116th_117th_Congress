RESOLUTION 
Supporting the goals and ideals of ‘‘National Poppy Day’’. 
Whereas poppies are worn and displayed as a symbolic trib-
ute to fallen and future veterans and members of the 
Armed Forces; 
Whereas the use of the poppy symbolically comes from the 
poem ‘‘In Flanders Fields’’, which movingly begins, ‘‘In 
Flanders Fields the poppies blow, between the crosses, 
row on row’’, referring to the poppies that sprang up in 
the churned-up earth of newly dug soldiers’ graves in 
parts of Belgium and France following World War I; 
Whereas at the end of World War I, the American Legion 
adopted the poppy as a symbol of freedom and the blood 
sacrificed by members of the Armed Forces in war; 
Whereas the American Legion family has long utilized the 
red poppy as its official flower, symbolizing the blood

shed by those who have served in the United States 
Armed Forces; 
Whereas the poppy is worn in England and Canada on Re-
membrance Day, also known as Armistice Day and 
Poppy Day, to commemorate members of the armed 
forces who have died in the line of duty; 
Whereas as the United States commemorates yearly the sac-
rifices of American lives during World War I and the 
American Legion honors those sacrifices through its inde-
fatigable efforts, it is fitting to expand the meaning of 
the poppy and formally recognize its historic symbolism; 
Whereas wearing a poppy can unite citizens from across the 
country who wish to show their patriotism and apprecia-
tion for those who serve as members of the United States 
Armed Forces; and 
Whereas the Friday before each Memorial Day is an appro-
priate day to recognize as ‘‘National Poppy Day’’: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the goals and ideals of ‘‘National 
2
Poppy Day’’; and 
3
(2) encourages all citizens, residents, and visi-
4
tors of the United States to join in observing ‘‘Na-
5
tional Poppy Day’’ to honor every member of the

Armed Forces who has died in the name of liberty,

freedom, and democracy while also showing their
