Whereas House and Senate Democrats have introduced nu-
merous proposals that implement a punitive fee on meth-
ane emissions from oil and gas operations that is tanta-
mount to a tax on natural gas; 
Whereas a proposed natural gas tax would increase the aver-
age United States family’s energy bill by 17 percent; 
Whereas a proposed natural gas tax would reduce the United 
States gross domestic product by $9,000,000,000 and re-
sult in 90,000 lost jobs; 
Whereas raising consumers’ energy bills would violate Presi-
dent Biden’s pledge to not raise taxes on those making 
less than $400,000 annually; 
Whereas a natural gas tax will increase the costs of thou-
sands of manufactured products, including personal pro-
tective equipment and critical medicines; 
Whereas a natural gas tax will disproportionally harm low-in-
come families; 
Whereas a natural gas tax on energy producers will nega-
tively impact United States farmers and ranchers by in-
creasing the costs of supplies needed for agricultural pro-
duction; 
Whereas a natural gas tax on United States agriculture will 
inhibit domestic food production, significantly raise costs 
for consumers, and make United States farmers less 
competitive globally; 
Whereas farm and ranch production systems play a key role 
in strengthening United States national security and food 
security; 
Whereas Europe and Asia are experiencing an energy crisis 
due to a shortage of natural gas, resulting in record-high

energy prices and further reliance on Russian natural gas 
and coal; 
Whereas handicapping United States domestic energy produc-
tion through burdensome taxes would empower foreign 
adversaries and weaken United States national security; 
Whereas a nation that can feed and power itself is inherently 
safer and more secure than one that cannot; 
Whereas energy security is national security; 
Whereas natural gas is fundamental to allowing the United 
States to lead the world in reducing greenhouse gas emis-
sions; 
Whereas the United States has established a long-term sup-
ply of natural gas to affordably and reliably power our 
economy for decades to come; 
Whereas United States natural gas exports are increasingly 
critical to establishing clean, affordable power and raising 
prosperity elsewhere around the world, and reducing 
global greenhouse gas emissions; 
Whereas, between 2005 and 2019, carbon dioxide emissions 
from the United States power sector declined by 28 per-
cent, with the generation of power from natural gas ac-
counting for more than half of such decline; 
Whereas, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, 
methane emissions from petroleum and natural gas sys-
tems declined by 31,900,000 metric tons of carbon diox-
ide equivalent from 1990 to 2017, and over the same pe-
riod, natural gas production increased by 51 percent, 
while oil production increased by 80 percent; 
Whereas Congress should promote policies that allow for in-
creased domestic energy production while simultaneously

Whereas the United States is the leader in innovation and 
conservation and will continue to lower emissions, protect 
the natural environment, and deliver affordable, reliable 
energy to United States families: Now, therefore, be it
