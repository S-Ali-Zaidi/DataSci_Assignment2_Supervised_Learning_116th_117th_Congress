ices Administration to enable the United States and 
State departments of public health to better combat dis-
parities that have emerged during the COVID–19 crisis 
and beyond, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Reducing COVID–19 
4
Disparities by Investing in Public Health Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
The Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Funding under this Act is essential to core 
8
efforts at the Department of Health and Human 
9
Services and in local and State health departments 
10
to prevent and control the spread of chronic disease 
11
and conditions. The National Center for Chronic 
12
Disease Prevention and Health Promotion works to 
13
raise awareness of health disparities faced by minor-
14
ity populations of the United States such as Amer-
15
ican Indians, Alaska Natives, Asian Americans, Afri-
16
can Americans, Latino Americans, and Native Ha-
17
waiians or other Pacific Islanders. One of the pri-
18
mary functions of the Center is to reduce risk fac-
19
tors for groups affected by health disparities. 
20
(2) Six in ten Americans live with at least one 
21
chronic disease, like heart disease and stroke, can-

cer, or diabetes. These and other chronic diseases 
1
are the leading causes of death and disability in 
2
America. Specifically, chronic diseases are respon-
3
sible for 7 in 10 deaths each year. According to the 
4
Centers 
for 
Disease 
Control 
and 
Prevention 
5
(‘‘CDC’’), individuals who are at high risk for severe 
6
illness from COVID–19 are people with chronic lung 
7
disease or moderate to severe asthma, people with 
8
serious 
heart 
conditions, 
people 
who 
are 
9
immunocompromised—sometimes because of cancer 
10
or HIV/AIDS, people with diabetes, people with liver 
11
disease, people with severe obesity, and people with 
12
chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis. 
13
(3) According to the CDC, adults suffering 
14
from cancer, chronic kidney disease, chronic lung 
15
diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary 
16
disease (COPD), asthma, interstitial lung disease, 
17
cystic fibrosis, and pulmonary hypertension, demen-
18
tia or other neurological conditions, diabetes, Down 
19
syndrome, heart conditions, including heart failure, 
20
coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathies or hyper-
21
tension, HIV infection, liver disease, sickle cell dis-
22
ease, stroke, or cerebrovascular disease are more 
23
likely to get severely ill from COVID–19 and face in-

creased rates of hospitalization, intensive care, as-
1
sisted ventilation, or even death. 
2
(4) According to hospital data from the first 
3
month of the COVID–19 epidemic in the United 
4
States released by the CDC, roughly 1 in 3 people 
5
who required hospitalizations from COVID–19 were 
6
African American. While 33 percent of total hos-
7
pitalized patients are Black, African Americans con-
8
stitute just 13 percent of the entire American popu-
9
lation. Early data released by States and municipali-
10
ties show that African Americans suffered higher 
11
mortality rates from COVID–19. 
12
(5) Racial and ethnic disparities in COVID–19 
13
hospitalization were driven by both a higher risk of 
14
exposure to the disease, often from essential front-
15
line work performed at disproportionate rates by 
16
Black and Latino workers, and social determinants 
17
of health. Social inequities and environmental injus-
18
tices, such as differing access to healthy food, clean 
19
air, safe drinking water, safe neighborhoods, edu-
20
cation, job security, and reliable transportation, af-
21
fect health risks and outcomes, reinforcing dispari-
22
ties in health and access to care. 
23
(6) Socioeconomic factors further contribute to 
24
racial disparities seen in both prevalence of chronic 
25

conditions and exposure to COVID–19. Individuals 
1
in low-income communities and people of color are 
2
more likely to have many of the chronic health con-
3
ditions that have been identified as risk factors for 
4
complications from COVID–19, yet suffer decreased 
5
access to care, compounded by a decreased likelihood 
6
of undergoing appropriate treatment. 
7
(7) According to the American Diabetes Asso-
8
ciation, 12.5 percent of Hispanic Americans, 11.7 
9
percent of African Americans, 9.2 percent of Asian 
10
Americans, and 14.7 percent of American Indians/ 
11
Alaska Natives have been diagnosed with diabetes, 
12
compared to just 7.5 percent of White Americans. 
13
The CDC calculated that compared to non-Hispanic 
14
Whites, Hispanics are 40 percent more likely to die 
15
from diabetes, African Americans are twice as likely 
16
to die from diabetes, and American Indians/Alaska 
17
Natives are almost twice as likely to die from the 
18
disease. 
19
(8) According to the National Institutes of 
20
Health, African Americans are more than 30 percent 
21
more likely to die from heart disease, are twice as 
22
likely to have a stroke—which tends to be more se-
23
vere with a higher morbidity and results in higher 
24
mortality, are 40 percent more likely to have high

blood pressure, and have a higher rate of hyper-
1
tension and heart failure than their White counter-
2
parts. 
3
(9) Minority groups suffer from asthma at a 
4
disproportionate rate, have the highest number of 
5
emergency room visits and hospital stays due to 
6
asthma, and have higher mortality rates from asth-
7
ma than their White counterparts. African Ameri-
8
cans, American Indians, and Alaska Natives are 42 
9
percent more likely than their White counterparts to 
10
have asthma. The prevalence of childhood asthma 
11
for African Americans is 11.7 percent higher than 
12
for White Americans, while mortality rates in chil-
13
dren and adults are eightfold and threefold higher, 
14
respectively, for African Americans compared to 
15
White Americans. 
16
(10) Vaccinations are key to disease prevention 
17
and overall health outcomes, especially in the case of 
18
COVID–19. However, a longstanding history and 
19
legacy of systemic racism, discrimination, and mis-
20
treatment has contributed to a larger distrust of the 
21
health care system and medical establishment within 
22
communities of color, which can further engender 
23
disparities and perpetuate rates of chronic disease. 
24
According to data from the CDC, despite higher 
25
00:49 Jul 02, 2021
H3904
7 
•HR 3904 IH
COVID–19 mortality, hospitalization, and infection 
1
rates amongst African Americans, the rate of 
2
COVID–19 vaccination amongst Black Americans 
3
still lags behind those of White individuals in almost 
4
every State. This necessitates increased funding for 
5
education, increased access to care, and targeted ef-
6
forts to reach communities of color and address ra-
7
cial inequities. 
8
(11) Cuts to, or even level funding for, the 
9
Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion 
10
Fund and other public health prevention efforts un-
11
dermine efforts to create an affordable and acces-
12
sible health care system, and a better quality of life 
13
for Americans of all ethnic, racial, and socio-
14
economic backgrounds. Cuts to this Fund would also 
15
exacerbate existing disparities and underlying health 
16
conditions that have created seemingly vast dispari-
17
ties in hospitalization and mortality rates due to 
18
COVID–19. 
19
(12) Prevention efforts have proven to be effec-
20
tive. Funding increases for community-based public 
21
health programs reduce preventable disease caused 
22
by diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. Im-

to 
4
$2,400,000,000 annually will allow the Fund to in-
5
vest in more innovative, evidence-based public health 
6
programs, maintain and expand investments in pro-
7
grams with demonstrated success, and help reduce 
8
racial health disparities and rates of chronic disease 
9
that can put persons of color at greater risk of hos-
10
pitalization or death from COVID–19. 
11
(14) Further, the Office of Minority Health in 
12
the Office of the Secretary of Health and Human 
13
Services (established by section 1707 of the Public 
14
Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300u–6)) was de-
15
signed for the purpose of ‘‘improving minority health 
16
and the quality of health care minorities receive, and 
17
eliminating racial and ethnic disparities’’. The Office 
18
of Minority Health and Health Equity at the CDC 
19
serves to decrease health disparities, address social 
20
determinants of health, and promote access to high- 
21
quality preventative health care. The Office of Mi-
22
nority Health and Health Equity at the Food and 
23
Drug Administration promotes and protects the

communication of science that addresses health dis-
1
parities. The National Institute on Minority Health 
2
and Health Disparities leads scientific research that 
3
advances understanding of minority health and 
4
health disparities. 
5
(15) Increasing funding for these and other 
6
critical health programs will enable the United 
7
States and State departments of public health to 
8
better combat disparities that have emerged during 
9
the COVID–19 crisis and beyond.
