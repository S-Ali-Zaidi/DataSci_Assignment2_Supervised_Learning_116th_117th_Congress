1
Prairie du Chien’’), the Potawatomi and other af-
2
fected Indian Tribes ceded certain land in northern

Potawatomi Chief Shab-eh-nay and his Band at 
5
their village near Paw Paw Grove, Illinois; 
6
(2)(A) pursuant to the Treaty of September 26, 
7
1833, made at Chicago (7 Stat. 431) (commonly

9
and other Indians ceded approximately 5,000,000 
10
acres of land, including the Shab-eh-nay Band Res-
11
ervation; but 
12
(B) the Senate rejected the provision that ceded 
13
that reservation, with the effect of affirming the In-
14
dian-held title and boundaries of the Shab-eh-nay 
15
Band Reservation; 
16
(3)(A) in 1849, while Chief Shab-eh-nay was 
17
visiting his relatives in Kansas, the Commissioner of 
18
the General Land Office of the United States sold 
19
the Shab-eh-nay Band Reservation at public auction 
20
to non-Indians who erroneously believed that they 
21
had acquired good title to the land on which the 
22
Shab-eh-nay Band Reservation is located; and

Act; 
3
(4) the Associate Solicitor of the Department of 
4
the Interior issued an opinion on July 24, 2000, 
5
that concluded that— 
6
(A) ‘‘the Shab-eh-nay Band Reservation 
7
continues to exist’’; 
8
(B) there is no evidence that Chief Shab- 
9
eh-nay abandoned the Shab-eh-nay Band Res-
10
ervation; and 
11
(C) ‘‘even if it were true that Shab-eh- 
12
nay’s Band had abandoned the land, the Band’s 
13
treaty recognized title to that land could not be 
14
extinguished without Congressional action’’; 
15
(5) the Solicitor of the Department of the Inte-
16
rior issued an opinion on January 18, 2001, that—

conveyance of the Shab-eh-nay Band Res-
2
ervation;

(iii) the Tribe is the lawful successor 
4
in interest to Chief Shab-eh-nay and his 
5
Band; and

(iv) the Department of the Interior

believes that the United States continues 
8
to bear a trust responsibility to the Tribe

for the Shab-eh-nay Band Reservation;

11
ute to extinguish the recognized Indian title to the

Shab-eh-nay Band Reservation;

14
Chief Shab-eh-nay and his Band and the rightful 
15
owner and occupant of the Shab-eh-nay Band Res-
16
ervation; 
17
(8) the Federal Government, through the ac-
18
tions of the General Land Office, has deprived the 
19
Tribe of the right of exclusive use and occupancy of
