A BILL 
To amend the Fair Credit Reporting Act to require nation-
wide consumer reporting agencies, upon request, to use 
a consumer’s current legal name on consumer reports, 
and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Credit Reporting Accu-
4
racy After a Legal Name Change Act of 2022’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 8478 IH
(1) Consumer reports are significant to the 
1
ability for American consumers to access credit, 
2
housing, and employment. 
3
(2) Fragmented files created by the credit re-
4
porting industry lead to inaccuracies on the con-
5
sumer reports of transgender and gender noncon-
6
forming consumers after a legal name change. Inac-
7
curate consumer reports create additional burdens 
8
and barriers for these consumers and impair their 
9
ability to access credit, housing, and employment. 
10
(3) As of 2017, there were approximately 1.4 
11
million adults who identify as transgender, according 
12
to the Williams Institute report, ‘‘Age of Individuals 
13
Who Identify as Transgender in the United States’’, 
14
and as of 2021, approximately 1.2 million adults 
15
identify as nonbinary, according to the Williams In-
16
stitute report, ‘‘Nonbinary LGBTQ Adults in the 
17
United States’’. 
18
(4) As evidence that transgender and gender 
19
nonconforming adults are vulnerable to discrimina-
20
tion, harassment, and abuse based on their gender 
21
identity and expression, in its 2016 report ‘‘Injustice 
22
at 
Every 
Turn’’, 
the 
National 
Center 
for 
23
Transgender Equality found that transgender adults 
24
experienced unemployment at twice the rate of the

general population, and 90 percent reported experi-
1
encing harassment, discrimination, or mistreatment 
2
in the workplace. The report further found that one 
3
in five transgender adults reported having been re-
4
fused a home or apartment because of their gender 
5
identity. 
6
(5) Transgender and gender nonconforming 
7
consumers face a myriad of problems in terms of 
8
consumer reporting problems after they change their 
9
names, including that their credit report fragments 
10
into two or more unconnected files upon their name 
11
change and that their name change and any credit 
12
actions that follow are never reflected in their report 
13
at all. Many consumers report that credit reporting 
14
problems have a negative impact on their financial 
15
and personal lives, including credit score decreases 
16
of 100 points or more, which can be a barrier to ac-
17
cessing banking services, mortgages, auto financing, 
18
employment, and rental housing. 
19
(6) Transgender consumers face severe adverse 
20
effects from having their former name reflected on 
21
their credit report. The disclosure of a transgender 
22
person’s prior name in a consumer report to a cred-
23
itor, employer, or lessor can expose those consumers

to unlawful discrimination on the basis of that con-

sumer’s gender identity.

SEC. 3. REQUIREMENT TO USE A CONSUMER’S CURRENT 
3
LEGAL NAME ON CONSUMER REPORTS. 
4
Section 605(a) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 
5
U.S.C. 1681c(a)) is amended by adding at the end the 
6
following: 
7
‘‘(9) With respect to a consumer reporting 
8
agency described in section 603(p), any prior name 
9
of the consumer about whom the report relates, 
10
other than the consumer’s current legal name, after 
11
receiving a request from the consumer to use only 
12
the consumer’s current legal name on all consumer 
13
reports.’’.
