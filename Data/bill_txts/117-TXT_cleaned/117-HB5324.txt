SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
8
Congress finds the following: 
9
(1) The NOAA Weather Radio is a nationwide 
10
network of transmitters that are critical to pro-
11
tecting life and property by broadcasting weather 
12
and other hazard alerts. 
13
(2) NOAA Weather Radio broadcasts currently 
14
reach 95 percent of the United States population. 
15
(3) NOAA Weather Radio broadcasts originate 
16
from all National Weather Service Offices, but are 
17
only available via a receiver located in sufficient 
18
proximity to a radio transmitting tower. 
19
(4) There are limited options to obtain NOAA 
20
Weather Radio broadcasts via the Internet or mobile 
21
device application, which are provided by volunteer 
22
mechanisms obtaining the audio feed in an ad hoc 
23
manner.

•HR 5324 IH
(5) NOAA Weather Radio should provide equal 
1
access and availability to unimpeded broadcasts of 
2
weather and non-weather hazards to every person lo-
3
cated within the United States, its territories, and 
4
tribal lands.

SEC. 4. UPGRADING EXISTING SYSTEMS. 
6
(a) IN GENERAL.—The Administrator shall, to the 
7
maximum extent practicable, expand coverage of the 
8
NOAA Weather Radio and ensure its reliability. In doing 
9
so, the Administrator shall— 
10
(1) maintain support for existing systems serv-
11
ing areas not covered by cellular service or having 
12
poor quality cellular service; 
13
(2) ensure consistent maintenance of, and time-
14
ly repairs to, broadcast towers and antennas; and 
15
(3) enhance the ability to amplify Non-Weather 
16
Emergency Messages via NOAA Weather Radio as 
17
necessary. 
18
(b) AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.—There is 
19
authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section 
20
$20,000,000, to remain available until expended.

SEC. 5. MODERNIZATION INITIATIVE. 
22
(a) IN GENERAL.—In parallel to the activities under 
23
section 4, the Administrator shall, to the maximum extent 
24
practicable, provide upgrades to the NOAA Weather Radio 
25

•HR 5324 IH
to ensure its capabilities and coverage remain valuable to 
1
the public. In carrying out these activities, the Adminis-
2
trator shall— 
3
(1) provide upgrades to the telecommunications 
4
infrastructure to accelerate the transition of broad-
5
casts to Internet Protocol-based communications 
6
over non-copper media; 
7
(2) accelerate software upgrades to the Ad-
8
vanced Weather Interactive Processing System in 
9
order to implement partial county notifications and 
10
alerts; 
11
(3) consult with private sector entities to ensure 
12
that NOAA Weather Radio data and feeds are easily 
13
accessible in a format and manner most beneficial 
14
for use by third-party products; 
15
(4) develop options, including satellite backup 
16
capability, for NOAA Weather Radio continuity in 
17
the event of Weather Forecast Office outages; 
18
(5) research and develop alternative options, in-
19
cluding microwave capabilities, to transmit NOAA 
20
Weather Radio signals to transmitters that are re-
21
mote or that do not have Internet Protocol capa-
22
bility; and 
23
(6) transition critical applications to the Inte-
24
grated Dissemination Program.

(c) ASSESSMENT FOR MANAGEMENT AND DISTRIBU-
6
TION.—Not later than 12 months after the date of enact-
7
ment of this Act, the Administrator shall complete an as-
8
sessment of access to NOAA Weather Radio. In con-
9
ducting such an assessment, the Administrator shall take 
10
into consideration and provide recommendations on— 
11
(1) the need for continuous, adequate, and 
12
operational real-time broadcasts of the NOAA 
13
Weather Radio in both urban and rural areas; 
14
(2) the availability of online services, such as 
15
websites and mobile device applications, that require 
16
NOAA Weather Radio access; 
17
(3) existing or new management systems, which 
18
promote consistent, efficient, and compatible access 
19
to NOAA Weather Radio; 
20
(4) the ability of the National Oceanic and At-
21
mospheric Administration to aggregate real time 
22
broadcast feeds at one or more central locations; 
23
(5) effective interagency coordination; and
