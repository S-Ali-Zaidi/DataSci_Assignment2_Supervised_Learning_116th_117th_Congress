•HRES 993 IH 
Whereas, on March 22, 1972, President Richard Nixon 
signed into law Public Law 92–258, which amended the 
Older Americans Act of 1965 (OAA) and established a 
national nutrition program for individuals 60 years and 
older; 
Whereas thousands of local senior nutrition programs, both 
congregate and home-delivered, are funded through the 
OAA nutrition program; 
Whereas these programs provide a vital lifeline to millions of 
older adults and individuals with disabilities in commu-
nities across the United States who may be homebound 
and isolated, struggling with hunger and malnutrition; 
Whereas local OAA nutrition programs provide nutritious 
meals, socialization, friendly visits, and wellness and safe-
ty checks through volunteers and staff to individuals who 
suffer from long-term chronic conditions, as well as to 
those who may need short-term assistance; 
Whereas the official purposes of the OAA nutrition program 
are to— 
(1) reduce hunger, food insecurity, and malnutrition; 
(2) promote socialization of older individuals; and 
(3) promote the health and well-being of older indi-
viduals by assisting such individuals to gain access to nu-
trition and other disease prevention and health promotion 
services that can delay the onset of adverse health condi-
tions resulting from poor nutritional health or sedentary 
behavior; 
Whereas the OAA nutrition program reduces other costs to 
taxpayers, primarily lowering Medicare and Medicaid ex-
penditures by helping to— 
(1) prevent falls;

(2) avoid unnecessary hospital transports, admis-
sions, and readmissions; 
(3) expedite recovery from illness; and 
(4) delay or prevent institutionalization; 
Whereas local OAA nutrition programs are proven, valuable, 
and effective public-private partnerships that leverage 
private, corporate, and individual donations and other 
non-Federal funding sources to operate their services effi-
ciently and successfully; 
Whereas the over-60 population of the United States is rap-
idly growing and projected to increase significantly every 
year for the next several decades, causing a similar in-
crease in the need and demand for local OAA nutrition 
program services; and 
Whereas this 50th anniversary of the OAA nutrition program 
provides an opportunity to celebrate and honor commu-
nity-based organizations that deliver these vital and crit-
ical services: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) recognizes and values the important work of 
2
local Older Americans Act of 1965 (OAA) nutrition 
3
programs nationwide in giving voice to millions of 
4
our Nation’s seniors each year, improving their qual-
5
ity of life and addressing senior hunger, malnutri-
6
tion, and isolation; 
7
(2) recognizes and values the important role 
8
that local OAA nutrition programs and national or-
9
ganizations play in increasing awareness of the 
10
growing unmet need for these programs and in rais-

ing additional non-Federal funds and soliciting vol-
1
unteers to support and assist the important missions 
2
of these programs; 
3
(3) recognizes and values volunteers as the 
4
backbone of the OAA nutrition program, noting that 
5
they deliver nutritious meals to seniors and individ-
6
uals with disabilities who are at significant risk of 
7
hunger, malnutrition, and isolation, and provide car-
8
ing concern and attention to the welfare of program 
9
participants; and 
10
(4) encourages Members of Congress to support 
11
their local OAA nutrition programs by— 
12
(A) participating in 50th anniversary 
13
events; 
14
(B) delivering meals to homebound seniors 
15
or serving them in a congregate setting with a 
16
program in their district or State; and 
17
(C) working to secure sustained Federal 
18
funding for the OAA nutrition program that 
19
will allow local providers to keep pace with in-
20
creased program costs and demand.
