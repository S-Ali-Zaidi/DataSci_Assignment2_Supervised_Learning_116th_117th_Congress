Congress finds that— 
7
(1) the United States has a significant interest 
8
in—

(A) preserving the worldwide system of 
1
richly varied habitats; 
2
(B) protecting native plant biodiversity and 
3
the ecosystems that support that biodiversity; 
4
and 
5
(C) protecting the quality of life of people 
6
in the United States; 
7
(2) native plants are an inseparable part of the 
8
natural beauty of the landscape of the United 
9
States, which must be preserved; 
10
(3) the extensive root systems of native plants 
11
control erosion, moderate floods, filter water to im-
12
prove water quality, decrease the amount of water 
13
needed for landscape maintenance, and sequester 
14
carbon to combat climate change; 
15
(4) native plants provide food and habitat for 
16
pollinators and wildlife; 
17
(5) native plants supply an important genetic 
18
record for future food, agriculture, and plant-derived 
19
products; 
20
(6) native plant communities are important 
21
components of cultural landscapes; 
22
(7) the use of native plant materials for res-
23
toration or enhancement contributes to the preserva-
24
tion of cultural landscapes;

(8) the use of native plant species in revegeta-
1
tion efforts after construction activities and adjacent 
2
to roadways increases habitat for a variety of polli-
3
nators and other native animal species; 
4
(9) supporting native plant communities within 
5
or adjacent to agricultural areas provides important 
6
wildlife habitat that would not otherwise be avail-
7
able; 
8
(10) the use of native plants in landscaping can 
9
reduce the need for herbicides and water use; and 
10
(11) of the 20,000 known native plant species 
11
in North America, it has been estimated that nearly 
12
25 to 30 percent are at risk of extinction as a result 
13
of factors such as habitat loss, invasive species, tem-
14
perature shifts, and pesticide use.

(6) NATIVE PLANT SPECIES.—The term ‘‘native

9
native or alien’’ means, with respect to a particular

capable of propagating that species, that occurs out-
13
side of the natural range of the organism. 
14
