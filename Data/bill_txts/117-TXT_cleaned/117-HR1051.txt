RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the designation of the week of April 
11 through April 17, 2022, as the fifth annual ‘‘Black 
Maternal Health Week’’ to bring national attention to 
the maternal health crisis in the United States and the 
importance of reducing maternal mortality and morbidity 
among Black women and birthing persons. 
Whereas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, Black women in the United States are 3 
times more likely than White women to die from preg-
nancy-related causes; 
Whereas Black women in the United States suffer from life- 
threatening pregnancy complications, known as ‘‘mater-
nal morbidities’’, twice as often as White women; 
Whereas maternal mortality rates in the United States are— 
(1) among the highest of any member country of the 
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Develop-
ment; and 
(2) increasing rapidly, from 17.4 deaths per 100,000 
live births in 2018, to 23.8 deaths per 100,000 live births 
in 2020; 
Whereas the United States has the highest maternal mor-
tality rate among affluent countries, in part because of 
the disproportionate mortality rate of Black women; 
Whereas Black women are 49 percent more likely than all 
other women to deliver prematurely;

Whereas the high rates of maternal mortality among Black 
women span across— 
(1) income levels; 
(2) education levels; and 
(3) socioeconomic status; 
Whereas structural racism, gender oppression, and the social 
determinants of health inequities experienced by Black 
women and birthing persons in the United States signifi-
cantly contribute to the disproportionately high rates of 
maternal mortality and morbidity among Black women 
and birthing persons; 
Whereas racism and discrimination play a consequential role 
in maternal health care experiences and outcomes of 
Black birthing persons; 
Whereas a fair and wide distribution of resources and birth 
options, especially with regard to reproductive health care 
services and maternal health programming, is critical to 
closing the racial gap in maternal health outcomes; 
Whereas Black midwives, doulas, perinatal health workers, 
and community-based organizations provide holistic ma-
ternal care but face structural and legal barriers to licen-
sure, reimbursement, and provision of care; 
Whereas COVID–19, which has disproportionately harmed 
Black Americans, is associated with an increased risk of 
adverse pregnancy outcomes and maternal and neonatal 
complications; 
Whereas the COVID–19 pandemic has further highlighted 
issues within the broken health care system in the United 
States and the harm of that system to Black women and 
birthing persons;

•HRES 1051 IH 
Whereas new data from the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention has indicated that since the COVID–19 pan-
demic began, the maternal mortality rate for Black 
women has increased by 26 percent; 
Whereas, even as there is growing concern about improving 
access to mental health services, Black women are least 
likely to have access to mental health screenings, treat-
ment, and support before, during, and after pregnancy; 
Whereas Black pregnant and postpartum workers are dis-
proportionately denied reasonable accommodations in the 
workplace, leading to adverse pregnancy outcomes; 
Whereas Black pregnant people disproportionately experience 
surveillance and punishment, including shackling incar-
cerated people in labor, drug testing mothers and infants 
without informed consent, separating mothers from their 
newborns, and criminalizing pregnancy outcomes; 
Whereas justice-informed, culturally congruent models of care 
are beneficial to Black women; and 
Whereas an investment must be made in— 
(1) maternity care for Black women and birthing 
persons, including support of care led by the communities 
most affected by the maternal health crisis in the United 
States; 
(2) continuous health insurance coverage to support 
Black women and birthing persons for the full 
postpartum period up to at least 1 year after giving 
birth; and 
(3) policies that support and promote affordable, 
comprehensive, and holistic maternal health care that is 
free from gender and racial discrimination, regardless of 
incarceration: Now, therefore, be it
