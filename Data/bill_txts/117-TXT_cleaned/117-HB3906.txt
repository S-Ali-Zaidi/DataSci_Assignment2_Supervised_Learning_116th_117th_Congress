8
posing agency and subject to public comment, shall

cause an adverse impact on the carbon storage, car-
11
bon sequestration, ecosystem, or habitat of a blue 
12
carbon area of significance. 
13
(3) ALTERNATIVE.—With respect to any pro-
14
posed action the Administrator determines will have 
15
an adverse impact under paragraph (2), the pro-
16
posing agency, in consultation with the Adminis-

18
native action that would prevent such adverse im-
19
pact and fulfill the purpose of the proposed action.

(4) CARBON STORAGE OFFSETS.—With respect

to a proposed action for which the agency deter-
2
mines no alternative is available under paragraph 
3
(3), the proposing agency shall— 
4
(A) in consultation with the Administrator, 
5
take measures to mitigate such adverse impact; 
6
(B) take such action as the Administrator 
7
determines necessary to create a coastal or ma-
8
rine blue carbon ecosystem storage offset that, 
9
taken in conjunction with the proposed action, 
10
results in a long term net increase in carbon 
11
storage, lasting an equivalent time period as the 
12
carbon storage lost by the adverse impact; 
13
(C) demonstrate quantitatively, using the 
14
best available science, that the carbon storage 
15
offset will result in a net increase in ecological 
16
carbon storage and is located in close proximity 
17
to the original site to keep the affected commu-
18
nities whole; 
19
(D) maintain such carbon storage offset 
20
for a period of time to be determined by the 
21
Administrator but not less than 100 years; and 
22

23
of mitigation in the Federal Register for public
