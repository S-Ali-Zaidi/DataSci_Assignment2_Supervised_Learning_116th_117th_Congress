A BILL 
To define the dollar as a fixed weight of gold, and for 
other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. FINDINGS. 
3
Congress finds the following: 
4
(1) The Federal Reserve note has lost more 
5
than 30 percent of its purchasing power since 2000, 
6
and 97 percent of its purchasing power since the 
7
passage of the Federal Reserve Act in 1913. 
8
(2) Under the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent in-
9
flation objective, the dollar loses half of its pur-
10
chasing power every generation, or 35 years.

(3) At times, including 2021 and 2022, Federal 
1
Reserve actions helped create inflation rates of 8 
2
percent or higher, increasing the cost of living for 
3
many Americans to untenable levels. 
4
(4) American families need long-term price sta-
5
bility to meet their household spending needs, save 
6
money, and plan for retirement. 
7
(5) The Federal Reserve policy of long-term in-
8
flation has made American manufacturing uncom-
9
petitive, raising the cost of United States manufac-
10
tured goods by more than 40 percent since 2000, 
11
compared to less than 20 percent in Germany and 
12
France. 
13
(6) Since 2000, United States manufacturing 
14
employment has declined by at least 25 percent after 
15
having remained steady at nearly 18,000,000 jobs 
16
for more than 30 years. 
17
(7) The American economy needs a stable dol-
18
lar, fixed exchange rates, and money supply con-
19
trolled by the market not the government. 
20
(8) The gold standard puts control of the 
21
money supply with the market instead of the Fed-
22
eral Reserve, discourages excessive deficit spending, 
23
and encourages the balancing of Federal budgets.

(9) The gold standard means legal tender de-
1
fined by and convertible into a certain quantity of 
2
gold. 
3
(10) Under the gold standard through 1913 the 
4
United States economy grew at an annual average of 
5
four percent, one-third larger than the growth rate 
6
since then and twice the level since 2000. 
7
(11) The Federal Reserve’s trickle down policy 
8
of expanding the money supply has primarily en-
9
riched the owners of financial assets while it has en-
10
dangered the jobs, wages, and savings of blue-collar 
11
workers. 
12
(12) Restoring American middle-class pros-
13
perity requires change in monetary policy authorized 
14
to Congress in Article I, Section 8, Clause 5 of the 
15
Constitution.
