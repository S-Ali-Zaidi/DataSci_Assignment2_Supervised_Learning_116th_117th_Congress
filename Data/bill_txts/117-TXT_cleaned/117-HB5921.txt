(1) IN
GENERAL.—The requirements of this

subsection with respect to a person that operates a 
5
covered internet platform that uses an opaque algo-
6
rithm are the following: 
7
(A) The person provides notice to users of

specific data to select the content the user sees.

Such notice shall be presented in a clear, con-
12
spicuous manner on the platform whenever the

15
can be dismissed by the user. 
16

17
of the platform that uses an input-transparent 
18
algorithm and enables users to easily switch be-
19
tween the version of the platform that uses an 
20
opaque algorithm and the version of the plat-
21
form that uses the input-transparent algorithm 
22
by selecting a prominently placed icon, which 
23
shall be displayed wherever the user interacts 
24
with an opaque algorithm.
