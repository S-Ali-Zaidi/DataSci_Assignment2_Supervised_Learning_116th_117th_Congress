Federal guarantee involved by allowing bidders for a 
17
BioBond to compete against each other by bidding

on the percentage of the Federal guarantee under 
19
subsection (b) with respect to the BioBond, with the 
20

(f) PRIORITIZATION OF TAXPAYER INTERESTS.—All

11
ment of a BioBond are first used to reduce the
