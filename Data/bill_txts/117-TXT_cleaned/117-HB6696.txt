The Congress finds that—

•HR 6696 IH
(1) housing is fundamentally an issue of eco-
1
nomic and racial justice and a critical determinant 
2
of health; 
3
(2) the 2008 financial crisis was a Great De-
4
pression-level event for Black Americans, wiping out 
5
decades of gains in Black homeownership, which has 
6
now fallen to its lowest rate since the passage of the 
7
Fair Housing Act in 1968; 
8
(3) Black borrowers were 76 percent more like-
9
ly to have lost their home to foreclosure than White 
10
borrowers during the foreclosure crisis; 
11
(4) Black and Hispanic households continue to 
12
be about twice as likely as White households to rent 
13
their homes; 
14
(5) in 2016, 58 percent of Black household 
15
heads and 54 percent of Hispanic household heads 
16
were renting their homes, compared with 28 percent 
17
of White household heads; 
18
(6) while cost burdens affect households of all 
19
races and ethnicities, Black and Brown renters are 
20
much more likely to be burdened, with 55 percent of 
21
Black renters considered to be rent burdened com-
22
pared to only 43 percent of White renters; 
23
(7) Black households account for 12 percent of 
24
all households in the United States, but 19 percent 
25

of all renters and 26 of all renter households with 
1
extremely low incomes; 
2
(8) prior to the coronavirus pandemic, it was 
3
estimated that around 3.7 million evictions are filed 
4
every year, a rate of about 7 every minute; 
5
(9) across the United States, one in 20 renters 
6
faces an eviction every year, but for Black renters, 
7
the number is one in 11; 
8
(10) every day families are displaced by the 
9
eviction crisis, a reality that is only further exacer-
10
bated by the COVID–19 pandemic and that falls 
11
disproportionately on Black renters, and particularly 
12
Black women renters; 
13
(11) the Department of Housing and Urban 
14
Development does not require the reporting or col-
15
lection of eviction data, including among households 
16
in federally assisted housing, and should be required 
17
to do so; 
18
(12) the American Civil Liberties Union’s anal-
19
ysis of Eviction Lab data found that, on average, 
20
‘‘Black renters had evictions filed against them at 
21
nearly twice the rate of White renters’’ and that 
22
Black women specifically were filed against for evic-
23
tion at ‘‘double the rate of White renters or higher 
24
in 17 of 36 [S]tates’’;

(13) right to counsel is a matter of racial jus-
1
tice, equity, and ensuring equal protection under the 
2
law; 
3
(14) nationally, it is estimated that more than 
4
81 percent of landlords are represented in housing 
5
court proceedings, compared to less than 3 percent 
6
of tenants in such proceedings; 
7
(15) a Massachusetts COVID–19 legal help 
8
project found that when providing full legal rep-
9
resentation to low-income tenants, 90 percent of 
10
cases closed resulted in positive outcomes, with 70 
11
percent of tenants remaining in their homes and 20 
12
percent of tenants having more time to find a place 
13
to live; and 
14
(16) a California study of the Shriver Civil 
15
Counsel Program found that 91 percent of Shriver 
16
cases ended with the eviction record sealed, 81 per-
17
cent with the eviction not reported to a credit agen-
18
cy, and 71 percent with a neutral reference provided 
19
by the landlord, tenants in such cases saved nearly 
20
$800 more in reduced rent and other fees while pay-
21
ing holdover damages or attorney’s fees only half as 
22
often, and 71 percent of represented clients that had
