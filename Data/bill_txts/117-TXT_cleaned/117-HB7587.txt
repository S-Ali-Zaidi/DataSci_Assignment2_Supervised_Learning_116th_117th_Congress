To strengthen the partnership between the nonprofit organi-
zations and the Federal Government, and for other pur-
poses. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Nonprofit Sector 
4
Strength and Partnership Act of 2022’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
The Congress finds that:

•HR 7587 IH
(1) The nonprofit sector is a trusted partner in 
1
working with American communities, strengthening 
2
civil society, and ensuring that all people living in 
3
the United States have the opportunity to thrive. 
4
(2) The Nation relies on the nonprofit sector on 
5
its ability to harness and direct the generosity, serv-
6
ice, and volunteerism of the American people. 
7
(3) Nonprofit organizations are a significant 
8
and highly diverse sector of the United States econ-
9
omy that includes 1,800,000 organizations as of 
10
2020, according to the Internal Revenue Service. 
11
United States nonprofit organizations contributed 
12
$1.2 trillion to the economy in 2020 and accounted 
13
for 5.9 percent of the Gross Domestic Product of the 
14
United States, according to Bureau of Economic 
15
Analysis data interpreted by Independent Sector. 
16
(4) Collectively, the nonprofit sector engages 
17
through and is supported by more than 12 million 
18
workers, 20 million board members, 63 million vol-
19
unteers, and 170 million donors. In 2017, United 
20
States nonprofits employed 12.5 million paid work-
21
ers and paid over $670 billion in wages. 
22
(5) 92 percent of the 501(c)(3) public charities 
23
in the United States have an annual budget of less 
24
21:35 Apr 27, 2022
H7587

•HR 7587 IH
than $1,000,000 according to data provided by the 
1
Internal Revenue Service. 
2
(6) While no Federal agency regularly collects 
3
systematic employment data on the nonprofit sector, 
4
at the local level, nonprofits are a time-tested mech-
5
anism for delivering critical community services. 
6
(7) In order to maximize the nonprofit sector’s 
7
ability to utilize Federal investments to respond to 
8
community need, the Federal Government should 
9
take steps to encourage, support, and promote vol-
10
unteerism and charitable giving. 
11
(8) National service programs provide an essen-
12
tial vehicle for Americans of all ages anxious to 
13
serve their communities and transform their own 
14
lives in the process. Service programs also provide a 
15
critical pipeline of emerging leaders into the work-
16
force, including the nonprofit workforce. 
17
(9) Like for-profit entities, the nonprofit sector 
18
is challenged during times of economic downturns. 
19
As employers and providers of services to countless 
20
Americans, the sustainability of this sector is of 
21
great national importance, yet the Federal Govern-
22
ment provides significant support to for-profit busi-
23
nesses through the Small Business Administration

and other agencies and programs that are not acces-
1
sible to nonprofit organizations. 
2
(10) Despite the importance of the nonprofit 
3
sector to the United States economy and to the suc-
4
cess of many Federal, State, and local policy initia-
5
tives, no Federal agency or office has responsibility 
6
for evaluating, building, or maintaining the capacity 
7
of the nonprofit sector. 
8
SEC. 3. PURPOSES. 
9

11
tor to address public challenges and maximize oppor-
12

13

14
(2) To strengthen communities across the 
15
United States by making the Federal Government a 
16
more productive partner with nonprofit organiza-
17
tions through the establishment of better Federal co-
18
ordination with respect to, enhanced transparency 
19
with respect to, and greater support for the work of 
20
nonprofit organizations. 
21
(3) Collect, assemble, and make available Fed-
22
