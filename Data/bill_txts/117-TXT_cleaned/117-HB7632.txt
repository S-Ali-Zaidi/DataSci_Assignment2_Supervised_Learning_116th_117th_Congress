Congress finds that—

•HR 7632 IH
(1) access to reliable, clean, and drinkable 
1
water is an essential human need and critical to the 
2
public health, well-being, educational attainment, 
3
and economic development of all communities in the 
4
United States; 
5
(2) many countries, along with the United Na-
6
tions, have recognized the urgency of the need to ac-
7
cess reliable, clean, and drinkable water by passing 
8
laws or resolutions relating to the human right to 
9
water and sanitation, including— 
10
(A) recognizing these water and sanitation 
11
needs exist among Indigenous peoples; and 
12
(B) establishing aggressive targets for 
13
achieving universal access to those basic serv-
14
ices; 
15
(3) in the United States, access to reliable, 
16
clean, and drinkable water has long been a signifi-
17
cant problem in many Native communities, such that 
18
nearly half of all households in those communities do 
19
not have access to reliable water sources, clean 
20
drinking water, or basic sanitation, and are signifi-
21
cantly more likely than White households to lack in-
22
door plumbing; 
23
(4) the trust responsibility of the Federal Gov-
24
ernment to Indian Tribes requires the Federal Gov-

•HR 7632 IH
ernment to ensure the survival and welfare of Indian 
1
Tribes, and the failure to provide basic water service 
2
cannot be reconciled with that trust responsibility; 
3
(5) the ongoing COVID–19 pandemic has had 
4
a disproportionate impact on Native communities 
5
due to a multitude of factors, including— 
6
(A) persistent economic disadvantages; 
7
(B) racial inequity; and 
8
(C) lack of public health infrastructure, in-
9
cluding access to running water; 
10
(6) on January 27, 2021, President Biden 
11
issued Executive Order 14008 (86 Fed. Reg. 7619 
12
(February 1, 2021)), which provides that it is the 
13
policy of the Biden Administration to secure envi-
14
ronmental justice and spur economic opportunity for 
15
disadvantaged communities that have been histori-
16
cally marginalized and overburdened by pollution 
17
and underinvestment in housing, transportation, 
18
water and wastewater infrastructure, and health 
19
care; 
20
(7) through the bipartisan Infrastructure In-
21
vestment and Jobs Act (IIJA), H.R. 3684, Congress 
22
has provided funding for the Indian Health Service 
23
and the Environmental Protection Agency to support 
24
the construction and repair of Tribal clean water in-

frastructure but no funding has yet been provided to 
1
assist Tribes with operation and maintenance of 
2
water infrastructure and such funding is necessary 
3
to protect the historic investment in this infrastruc-
4
ture and to offset Tribes’ inability to access funding 
5
sources relied upon by most municipal water pro-
6
viders; 
7
(8) technical assistance to Tribes is also nec-
8
essary to ensure that they are able to access and 
9
take advantage of the new construction funding 
10
made available through the IIJA, that they develop 
11
the managerial, financial, and regulatory framework 
12
necessary for a fully functional and self-sustaining 
13
utility, and that they are able to engage appropriate 
14
outside consultants to assist as needed; 
15
(9) advances in water technology, including 
16
treatment, sensors, and innovative pipeline mate-
17
rials, can assist in— 
18
(A) accelerating efforts to provide uni-
19
versal access to reliable, clean, and drinkable 
20
water for all Native communities; and 
21
(B) enhancing resilience in the face of cli-
22
mate change; 
23
(10) the COVID–19 pandemic has been a stark 
24
reminder that access to reliable, clean, and drinkable 
25

•HR 7632 IH
water to support basic hygiene is a matter of life or 
1
death for all individuals in the United States; 
2
(11) it is in the interest of the United States, 
3
and it is the policy of the United States, that all ex-
4
isting Native communities be provided with safe and 
5
adequate water supply systems as soon as prac-
6
ticable; and 
7
(12) both appropriate funding at the level of 
8
unmet need and a ‘‘whole of government’’ approach 
9
among all Federal agencies are essential to provide 
10
a meaningful solution to the lack of access to clean 
11
water on Tribal lands.
