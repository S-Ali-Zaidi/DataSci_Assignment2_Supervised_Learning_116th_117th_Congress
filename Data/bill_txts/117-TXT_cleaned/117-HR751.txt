RESOLUTION 
Condemning the repressive designation by the Government 
of Israel of six prominent Palestinian human rights and 
civil society groups as terrorist organizations, and for 
other purposes. 
Whereas the Government of Israel designated six prominent 
Palestinian human rights and civil society groups as ‘‘ter-
rorist organizations’’ on October 19, 2021, a designation 
that effectively criminalizes the activities of legitimate 
civil society groups and authorizes Israeli authorities to 
close their offices, seize their assets, and arrest and jail 
their staff members; 
Whereas the six prominent Palestinian human rights and civil 
society organizations are Addameer, Al-Haq, Defense for

Children International–Palestine, the Union of Agricul-
tural Work Committees, the Bisan Center for Research 
and Development, and the Union of Palestinian Women 
Committees, which work directly with Palestinian women 
and girls, children, small holder farmers, prisoners, and 
civil society activists, providing direct services and moni-
toring and exposing human rights abuses, including ongo-
ing expansion of settlements in violation of international 
law; 
Whereas Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, 
in a joint statement, called the move ‘‘appalling and un-
just’’ and ‘‘an alarming escalation that threatens to shut 
down the work of Palestine’s most prominent civil society 
organizations’’; 
Whereas 21 of the leading Israeli human rights groups issued 
a joint statement calling this a ‘‘draconian measure that 
criminalizes critical human rights work’’; 
Whereas United Nations human rights experts unequivocally 
condemned the decision declaring that the ‘‘designation is 
a frontal attack on the Palestinian human rights move-
ment, and on human rights everywhere’’ and ‘‘not what 
a democracy adhering to well-accepted human rights and 
humanitarian standards would do’’; 
Whereas the Israeli newspaper Haaretz called the decision ‘‘A 
stain upon Israel’’ and said, ‘‘The outlawing of human 
rights groups and persecution of humanitarian activists 
are quintessential characteristics of military regimes, in 
which democracy in its deepest sense is a dead letter’’; 
Whereas, over the past several years, Israeli, Palestinian, and 
international human rights and humanitarian organiza-
tions have faced an increasingly difficult operating envi-

ronment and shrinking civic space in Israel and the occu-
pied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza 
Strip, that negatively impacts their ability to deliver as-
sistance and advocate on behalf of Palestinian human 
rights; 
Whereas delegitimization and disinformation campaigns have 
been advanced by a network of rising nationalist Israeli 
civil society organizations and associated organizations 
outside of Israel, with the support of Israeli government 
ministries and aim to silence and eliminate lawful human 
rights work that exposes widespread human rights viola-
tions inherent in Israel’s military occupation of Palestin-
ians; 
Whereas antiterrorism legislation must not be used to 
unjustifiably undermine civil liberties or to curtail the le-
gitimate work of human rights organizations and must be 
applied in a manner that is consistent with international 
law and does not violate obligations under international 
law; and 
Whereas the United States provides $3.8 billion in military 
funding to the Israeli government each fiscal year and 
therefore holds a unique obligation to speak out against 
and condemn actions by the Israeli government that in-
tentionally undermine democratic values and internation-
ally recognized human rights: Now, therefore, be it
