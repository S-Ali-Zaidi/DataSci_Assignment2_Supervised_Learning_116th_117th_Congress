ARTICLE I 
1
Merrick Brian Garland, in his conduct while Attorney 
2
General, engaged in a pattern of conduct that is incompat-
3
ible with his duties as an Officer of the United States, 
4
as follows: 
5
Attorney General Garland took an oath to defend and 
6
secure our country and uphold the Constitution when he 
7
was sworn in as Attorney General on March 11, 2021. 
8
Article II of the U.S. Constitution tasks the executive 
9
branch—which today includes the Attorney General—with 
10
ensuring the laws passed by Congress and signed into law 
11
by the President are faithfully executed. 
12
Attorney General Garland has failed to faithfully up-
13
hold his oath and has instead presided over a reckless and 
14
corrosive politicization of the Department of Justice at the 
15
expense of our Nation’s children. 
16
On September 29, 2021, the National School Boards 
17
Association (NSBA) sent a letter to President Biden re-
18
questing a joint expedited review by the U.S. Departments 
19
of Justice, Education, and Homeland Security examining 
20
appropriate enforceable actions against alleged threats to 
21
school boards under Federal statutes including the USA 
22
PATRIOT Act (Public Law 107–56). 
23
The USA PATRIOT Act gave the Federal Govern-
24
ment expansive authority to violate the civil liberties of

everyday Americans, via methods including wiretapping; 
1
bulk collection of telephone metadata and other records; 
2
warrantless surveillance; sweeping powers of detention; in-
3
vestigations into lawful First Amendment activity; and the 
4
expanded use of National Security Letters. 
5
The Act has been used to investigate non-terrorism 
6
offenses, such as drug trafficking and copyright infringe-
7
ment. It was also unsuccessfully used to justify placing 
8
a GPS tracking device on an alleged drug trafficker in 
9
violation of the Fourth Amendment and secretly search 
10
homes and offices without probable cause. 
11
The Act also expanded the use of National Security 
12
Letters, which the Department of Justice has abused to 
13
obtain information outside the scope of suspected terrorist 
14
activities and without due process. A 2007 Department 
15
of Justice Office of Inspector General report found that 
16
the FBI obtained telephone records on over 700 occasions 
17
without even issuing an NSL or a grand jury subpoena. 
18
That report also found that the FBI used NSLs in viola-
19
tion of existing statutes and departmental guidelines and 
20
policies. 
21
On October 4, 2021, the Department of Justice re-
22
leased a memorandum from Attorney General Garland 
23
promising to announce a series of measures designed to 
24
address the alleged rise in criminal conduct toward school

personnel, including opening dedicated lines of commu-
1
nication for threat reporting. Attorney General Garland’s 
2
memo made no mention of the statutory authority or au-
3
thorities the Department would use to address those 
4
threats. 
5
The numerous, well-documented abuses of the PA-
6
TRIOT Act and other domestic terrorism statutes—often 
7
in contravention of Americans’ First, Fourth, and Fifth 
8
Amendment rights—should preclude them from consider-
9
ation in addressing unfounded and uninvestigated threats 
10
to school personnel. Their misuse by the Department of 
11
Justice will lead to a chilling effect on the protected speech 
12
of parents who wish to express legitimate concerns about 
13
their children’s education and safety, such as in the case 
14
of a father seeking answers in October 2021 after a male 
15
teenager allegedly raped and sodomized his daughter in 
16
a bathroom at a high school in Loudoun County, Virginia, 
17
which was cited as a specific example of school violence 
18
in the September 2021 National School Boards Associa-
19
tion’s letter. 
20
State school boards associations have likened this ap-
21
proach to Federal overreach and have expressed worries 
22
about its possible suppression of First Amendment activ-
23
ity. While the September 29, 2021, NSBA letter cited 
24
media reports about Virginia school board meetings, an

October 6, 2021, press release by the Virginia School 
1
Boards Association emphasized that they did not seek the 
2
involvement of Federal law enforcement officials in local 
3
decisions. Similarly, an October 11, 2021, Florida School 
4
Boards Association letter underscored the importance of 
5
free speech and their reliance on local and State law en-
6
forcement. The Pennsylvania School Boards Association 
7
voted to cancel its membership in the National School 
8
Boards Association entirely. 
9
Furthermore, devoting valuable Department of Jus-
10
tice resources to demonizing parents expressing constitu-
11
tional speech—such as questions about alleged sexual as-
12
saults—as domestic terrorists would dangerously limit the 
13
credibility and ability of the Department of Justice to 
14
prosecute verifiable terrorist threats. 
15
Attorney General Garland’s failure to explicitly de-
16
nounce the use of this statute will hamper legitimate First 
17
Amendment activity aimed at protecting American chil-
18
dren and improving our Nation’s schools while decreasing 
19
the resources available to pursue actual terrorists. 
20
Wherefore, Merrick Brian Garland, by such conduct, 
21
warrants impeachment and trial, and removal from office.

Article II of the U.S. Constitution tasks the executive

7
ensuring the laws passed by Congress and signed into law 
8

9
Attorney General Garland has failed to faithfully up-
10
hold his oath and has by his actions, validated the belief 
11
of many Americans that the Department of Justice has 
12
been transformed into an unstoppable, partisan, Federal 
13
weapon used to officially punish political opponents. 
14
In an October 4, 2021, memorandum, Attorney Gen-
15
eral Garland announced that the Department of Justice 
16
would address alleged criminal conduct of lawful First 
17
Amendment activities objecting, among other things, to 
18
the teaching of ‘‘equity’’, ‘‘inclusion’’, and ‘‘critical race 
19
theory’’ concepts in public school districts. 
20
Attorney General Garland’s son-in-law is the co- 
21
founder of Panorama Education, which contracts with 
22
school districts to survey students on topics including ‘‘so-
23
cial-emotional learning’’ and ‘‘equity and inclusion’’. Pan-

Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan. According 
1
to its website, the company has previously contracted with 
2
the Hawaii Department of Public Education and the Fres-
3
no Unified School District. 
4
On June 8, 2021, Panorama Education was awarded 
5
a $1.8 million contract by Fairfax County Public Schools 
6
to conduct surveys on topics including race and ‘‘inclu-
7
sion’’ and implement ‘‘interventions’’. On September 9, 
8
2021, the contract was increased to $2.4 million. 
9
Despite Attorney General Garland’s close personal re-
10
lationship with an individual who stands to financially 
11
benefit from the promotion of ‘‘equity’’, ‘‘inclusion’’, and 
12
‘‘critical race theory’’ concepts in public school curricula— 
13
and the suppression of dissenting opinions—Attorney 
14
General Garland has not addressed this obvious conflict 
15
of interest. 
16
This lack of action runs counter to the steps that ca-
17
reer service executive branch officials, including Depart-
18
ment of Justice employees, must take to avoid ‘‘an appear-
19
ance of loss of impartiality’’, which include recusal from 
20
related matters and consultation with an agency ethics of-
21
ficial (5 CFR 2635.502). 
22
Attorney General Garland’s failure to address a pos-
23
sible conflict of interest demonstrates that he is unfit to 
24
hold the office of Attorney General.
