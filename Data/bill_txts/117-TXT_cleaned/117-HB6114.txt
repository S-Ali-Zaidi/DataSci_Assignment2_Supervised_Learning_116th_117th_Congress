TITLE I—UNITED STATES TRADE 
1
LEADERSHIP IN THE INDO- 
2
PACIFIC REGION 
3
SEC. 101. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress makes the following findings: 
5
(1) Rising authoritarian powers that adhere to 
6
non-market principles for managing their economies 
7
are challenging the United States strategic influence 
8
in the Indo-Pacific region. These mercantilist poli-
9
cies, which include predatory industrial planning to 
10
subsidize exports and support national champions at 
11
the expense of foreign competitors, conditioning 
12
market access on both forced and voluntary tech-
13
nology transfers, and intellectual property theft, 
14
among other unfair policies, are contrary to the in-
15
terests and values of the United States and its Indo- 
16
Pacific allies and directly challenge the United 
17
States economic and trade interests in the region. 
18
(2) The United States was a leader during ne-
19
gotiations for the Trans Pacific Partnership Agree-
20
ment (TPP) and joined eleven other nations in the 
21
Asia-Pacific in signing the agreement on February 
22
4, 2016. 
23
(3) In January 2017, the United States notified 
24
the other 11 signatories to the TPP that it did not 
25

•HR 6114 IH
intend to become a party to the Agreement. The no-
1
tification letter to the 11 other TPP signatories af-
2
firmed that ‘‘[t]he United States remains committed 
3
to taking measures designed to promote more effi-
4
cient markets and higher levels of economic growth, 
5
both in our country and around the world.’’. 
6
(4) Following the United States formal with-
7
drawal from the TPP, the 11 remaining signatories 
8
(Australia; Brunei; Canada; Chile; Japan; Malaysia; 
9
Mexico; New Zealand; Peru; Singapore; and Viet-
10
nam) renegotiated and signed a new Comprehensive 
11
and Progressive Agreement on Trans-Pacific Part-
12
nership (CPTPP) on March 8, 2018. Like the TPP, 
13
the CPTPP includes high-standard provisions to 
14
eliminate tariff and non-tariff barriers in key sectors 
15
such as agriculture, autos, currency, e-commerce/ 
16
digital trade, government procurement, goods tariffs, 
17
intellectual property rights (IPR), investment, work-
18
er rights, environment, rules of origin (ROO), serv-
19
ices, and state-owned enterprises (SOEs). However, 
20
the CPTPP suspended certain high-standard provi-
21
sions which the United States had proposed or sup-
22
ported. United States engagement in TPP negotia-
23
tions helped shape many of the provisions of the ex-
24
isting CPTPP. Similar, and updated versions of 
25
23:22 Dec 10, 2021
H6114

•HR 6114 IH
many of these provisions are included in the United 
1
States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), includ-
2
ing in the chapter on technical barriers to trade 
3
(TBT). 
4
(5) United States withdrawal from the TPP has 
5
undermined its ability to promote United States-led 
6
rules, norms, and standards, and has paved the way 
7
for increased non-democratic state-driven economic 
8
and political presence in the Indo-Pacific region.

SEC. 102. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
10
(a) IN GENERAL.—It is the policy of the United 
11
States, in pursuing trade leadership in the Indo-Pacific

consider modernizing and updating existing 
8

9
(2) The United States and its allies should uti-

12
the Indo-Pacific region to ensure, among other 
13
areas— 
14
(A) free flow of commerce;

16
(C) elimination of tariff and non-tariff bar-
17
riers on goods, services, agriculture, and energy; 
18

minerals, 
medicines, 
next-generation 
semi-
15
conductors, telecommunications, artificial intel-

ing and high-growth Indo-Pacific countries that may

2
SEC. 103. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
3
It is the sense of Congress that the implementation 
4
of the policy described in section 102 requires the fol-
5
lowing actions: 
6
(1) Long-term competition and strategic en-
7
gagement in the Indo-Pacific region will require the 
8
United States to deeply engage with allies and part-
9
ners on trade policy in the region, including the con-
10
sideration of joining new or updated, high-standard 
11
trade agreements, to establish trade and economic 
12
stability in the most vibrant economic region in the 
13
world. A sense of urgency by the Administration, bi-
14
partisanship in Congress, and whole-of-government 
15
approach will be required to achieve this significant 
16
pivot in United States trade policy. Immediate, in-
17
tensive bipartisan engagement between the Adminis-
18
tration and Congress to develop and swiftly reau-
19
thorize and update the Bipartisan Congressional 
20
Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015 is 
21
a critical step to provide the Administration with 
22
tools to negotiate ambitious new trade agreements. 
23
(2) The United States, through the leadership 
24
of the Office of the United States Trade Representa-
25

tive, must urgently coordinate closely with like-mind-
1
ed countries throughout the Indo-Pacific region to 
2
express immediate interest in new or updated, high- 
3
standard trade agreements, including by hosting a 
4
series of summits held throughout the region to dis-
5
cuss outlaying issues that are reflective of a post- 
6
pandemic global economy. 
7
(3) The President must lead and direct the en-
8
tire executive branch, specifically the Office of the 
9
United States Trade Representative, to make mem-
10
bership and leadership in new or updated, high- 
11
standard trade agreements a priority and assure the 
12
allocation of appropriate resources adequate to ad-
13
dress market-access barriers and trade distortions in 
14
the Indo-Pacific region. 
15
(4) The United States must ensure that key 
16
Federal agencies, led by the Office of the United 
17
States Trade Representative, advance accelerated, 
18
bipartisan, frequent, sustained, and meaningful col-
19
laboration and consultation with Congress regarding 
20
a robust United States trade strategy in the Indo- 
21
Pacific region.

(5) The United States must ensure that key 
23

celerated Indo-Pacific trade strategy consultations 
1
with Congress, the private sector, civil society, uni-
2
versities, and academic institutions, and other rel-
3
evant stakeholders. 
4
(6) The President should direct the Office of 
5
the United States Trade Representative, the White 
6
House National Security Council, and all relevant 
7
Federal agencies to meet upon request with any 
8
Member of Congress regarding the components of its 
9
Indo-Pacific trade strategy, including the President’s 
10
intention to begin negotiations to implement that 
11
strategy, the objectives for such negotiations, and 
12
any changes in the laws of the United States or the 
13
administration of those laws that may be rec-
14
ommended to Congress to implement that strategy. 
15
The President should also direct the Office of the 
16
United States Trade Representative, the White 
17
House National Security Council, and all relevant 
18
Federal agencies to provide access to pertinent docu-
19
ments relating to any such negotiation, including

AND THE PEOPLE’S REPUB-

SEC. 201. FINDINGS. 
7
Congress makes the following findings: 
8
(1) On January 15, 2020, the United States 
9
and the People’s Republic of China (PRC) signed a 
10
historic and enforceable agreement, the Economic 
11
and Trade Agreement Between the United States of 
12
America and the People’s Republic of China, or the 
13
‘‘Phase One’’ trade agreement. The Phase One trade 
14
agreement went into effect on February 14, 2020, 
15
and requires the PRC to undertake a wide range of 
16
reforms to facilitate a more transparent and equal 
17
bilateral trading relationship in areas such intellec-
18
tual property, technology transfer, agriculture, fi-
19
nancial services, and currency and foreign exchange. 
20
(2) The Phase One trade agreement includes a 
21
chapter on ‘‘Expanding Trade’’, in which the PRC 
22
made specific commitments to import a wide range 
23
of United States goods and services, including man-
24
ufactured goods, food and seafood, agriculture, en-
25
23:22 Dec 10, 2021
H6114
11 
•HR 6114 IH
ergy products, and services in a total amount that 
1
exceeds the PRC’s annual level of imports for those 
2
goods and services in 2017 by no less than $200 bil-
3
lion for a two-year period from January 1, 2020, 
4
through December 31, 2021. The United States and 
5
the PRC also stated a shared expectation that ‘‘the 
6
trajectory of increases’’ in China’s purchases of 
7
United States goods in each of these categories 
8
would continue in calendar years 2022 through 
9
2025. 
10
(3) Publicly available trade data show that the 
11
PRC has made significant progress in purchasing 
12
United States products within the agriculture sector, 
13
but is far behind its agreed upon year-end pur-
14
chasing targets in energy, manufacturing, and serv-
15
ices. 
16
(4) The Phase One trade agreement features a 
17
chapter on ‘‘Bilateral Evaluation and Dispute Reso-
18
lution’’ that establishes a process to resolve disputes 
19
in a fair and prompt manner and creates an avenue 
20
to conduct regular bilateral meetings at the principal 
21
and working levels. 
22
(5) The Phase One trade agreement represents 
23
an important and concrete step toward a more bal-
24
anced economic relationship between the United 
25
23:22 Dec 10, 2021
H6114

•HR 6114 IH
States and the PRC but substantially more is need-
1
ed to address systemic problems in our bilateral 
2
trading relationship. Important remaining issues in-
3
clude the PRC’s persistent theft of United States in-
4
tellectual property rights, its market access policies 
5
that depend on forced technology transfers and dis-
6
criminatory licensing practices, and its support for 
7
state-owned enterprises with market-distorting and 
8
World Trade Organization (WTO)-inconsistent sub-
9
sidies. 
10
SEC. 202. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
11
It is the sense of Congress that— 
12
(1) the United States should successfully and 
13
fully implement the Phase One trade agreement, en-
14
suring that the PRC fully complies with its stated 
15
commitments both to make legal and regulatory 
16
changes in various sectors and to purchase addi-
17
tional United States goods and services; 
18
(2) the Office of the United States Trade Rep-
19
resentative should take expedited and concrete steps 
20
toward thorough consultation and coordination with 
21
Congress and key United States private sector 
22
stakeholders wholly consistent with the spirit and 
23
letter of the law as prescribed under the Bipartisan

3
(3) the United States Government should ana-
4
lyze all positive and negative effects on the United 
5
States economy of the current tariffs in place 
6
against the PRC under section 301 of the Trade Act 
7
of 1974, including the effects on United States 
8
workers, businesses, and consumers and an analysis 
9
of the benefits of such tariffs providing sufficient 
10
trade leverage on the PRC, in comparison to these 
11
tariffs’ harm to the United States economy; 
12
(4) consistent with such analysis, the United 
13
States Government should immediately modify such 
14
tariffs to ensure that they meet the intent of the 
15
statute and provide leverage on China without harm-
16
ing the United States economy; 
17
(5) the Office of the United States Trade Rep-
18
resentative should articulate a long-term trade and

economic plan with the PRC, which may include pro-
20
posed new enforcement tools to address the PRC’s 
21
ongoing economic and structural challenges, includ-
22
ing the PRC’s use of massive industrial subsidies

that are inconsistent with WTO norms and rules
