SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Willie O’Ree was the first Black player to 
3
compete in the National Hockey League (NHL), ap-
4
pearing for the Boston Bruins on January 18, 1958, 
5
in the throes of the civil rights movement in the 
6
United States helping to end racial segregation in 
7
the premier professional ice hockey league; he is 
8
widely referred to as the ‘‘Jackie Robinson of Hock-
9
ey’’. 
10
(2) Willie O’Ree was born October 15, 1935, in 
11
Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada; he is the 
12
youngest of 13 children and a descendant of Paris 
13
O’Ree, whose name appears in the famous historical 
14
document ‘‘The Book of Negroes’’. 
15
(3) Willie O’Ree was raised by his parents in 
16
Fredericton, a predominantly White town where 
17
hockey was deeply rooted within the culture. O’Ree 
18
was a standout athlete on the ice and the baseball 
19
diamond. 
20
(4) At age 21, O’Ree was being scouted by pro-
21
fessional baseball teams and seriously considered 
22
baseball as a career. Upon experiencing the seg-
23
regated South for the first time while appearing for 
24
a minor league tryout, his dream changed and his 
25
attention turned solely to ice hockey.

(5) While playing amateur hockey, Willie was 
1
struck in his right eye with a puck and lost his eye-
2
sight. He was told by doctors to abandon his hockey 
3
career; instead, never disclosing the extent of his in-
4
jury, he pursued his dream of playing professional 
5
hockey. 
6
(6) At the age of 22, O’Ree was called up from 
7
the Quebec Aces of the Quebec Hockey League 
8
(QHL) to play for the NHL’s Boston Bruins at a 
9
time when only 6 teams existed in the league. O’Ree 
10
was unaware he had broken the color barrier at the 
11
top level of the sport until he read it in the news-
12
paper the following day. 
13
(7) Blind in 1 eye and a victim of racism at 
14
times throughout his career, O’Ree persevered and 
15
played professional hockey for 22 years, tallying over 
16
1,000 points. 
17
(8) In 1996, 17 years after O’Ree retired from 
18
professional hockey, the National Hockey League 
19
hired O’Ree as the first-ever Diversity Ambassador. 
20
Having already changed the game forever through 
21
his courage and convictions, O’Ree gives new defini-
22
tion to what it means to be a trailblazer. 
23
(9) In this role as Diversity Ambassador with 
24
the NHL, O’Ree set out to grow the sport by pro-
25

viding access, opportunity, and motivation for chil-
1
dren of all races, ethnicities, origins, and abilities. 
2
With O’Ree providing a vivid example of what is 
3
possible and serving as a relentless supporter of chil-
4
dren pursuing their dreams, more than 30 nonprofit 
5
youth organizations, dubbed Hockey is for Everyone 
6
programs, were developed across North America, 
7
each committed to offering minority and under-
8
served children an opportunity to play hockey, 
9
leveraging the sport to build character, foster posi-
10
tive values, and develop important life skills. 
11
(10) Through Hockey is for Everyone pro-
12
grams, more than 120,000 boys and girls have been 
13
positively impacted. O’Ree has devoted nearly 2,500 
14
days on the ground with the youth participants, vis-
15
iting more than 500 schools, community centers, and 
16
rinks to speak to hockey’s core values and beliefs: 
17
stay in school; set goals for yourself; remain com-
18
mitted and disciplined; and always respect your 
19
teammates, coaches, and parents. 
20
(11) Hockey is for Everyone programs have 
21
provided important opportunities for youth to par-
22
take in physical fitness. Today in the United States, 
23
fewer than half of the children ages 6–11 engage in 
24
the recommended amount of physical activity, and

that number is lower for low-income families. O’Ree 
1
has stood as a champion of youth athletic participa-
2
tion and its health benefits for decades. 
3
(12) Hockey is for Everyone programs provide 
4
numerous off-ice services to youth: SAT and aca-
5
demic tutoring, mentoring, nutrition education, col-
6
lege counseling, community service opportunities, 
7
and more. The program has excelled at using hockey 
8
as a vehicle to improve the social and emotional 
9
wellness of youth and improve students’ academic 
10
performances both in primary school and beyond. 
11
(13) O’Ree was also named a Member of the 
12
Order of Canada in 2008 and, in 2018, the City of 
13
Boston released an official Proclamation recognizing 
14
January 18, the anniversary of the day he broke 
15
into the game, as ‘‘Willie O’Ree Day’’. 
16
(14) In November 2018, 60 years after O’Ree 
17
entered the NHL, he was inducted into the Hockey 
18
Hall of Fame in the ‘‘builder’’ category in recogni-
19
tion of his efforts to grow the game, using his posi-
20
tion and the platform of hockey to improve the lives 
21
of children throughout North America.
