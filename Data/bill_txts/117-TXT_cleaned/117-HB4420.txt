A BILL 
To repeal the 25 percent cap on United States contributions 
to United Nations peacekeeping operations, and for other 
purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘United States Commit-
4
ment to Peacekeeping Act of 2021’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds as follows: 
7
(1) United Nations (UN) peacekeeping oper-
8
ations are a critical force-multiplier for the United

States, and decades of research has found peace-
1
keeping to be highly effective in reducing civilian 
2
deaths, shortening the duration of conflicts, con-
3
taining the geographic spread of war, and reducing 
4
the likelihood of conflict reoccurrence and sexual and 
5
gender-based violence. 
6
(2) The Government Accountability Office 
7
found in 2006 and 2018 reviews that it is eight 
8
times cheaper to financially support a United Na-
9
tions mission than to deploy United States military 
10
forces. 
11
(3) Every UN member state is legally required 
12
to finance the UN’s peacekeeping budget in order to 
13
ensure that these missions are properly resourced, 
14
and assessment rates are renegotiated every three 
15
years by the UN General Assembly. In 2018 the 
16
United States voted in support of the current rate 
17
structure, which sets United States peacekeeping 
18
contributions at 27.89 percent. 
19
(4) Since fiscal year 2017, the United States 
20
has accrued more than $1 billion in debt on its fi-
21
nancial obligations to UN peacekeeping, due to con-
22
gressional enforcement of a 1994 law that limits 
23
United States contributions to 25 percent of the 
24
01:39 Jul 27, 2021
H4420
3 
•HR 4420 IH
total UN peacekeeping budget in any fiscal year 
1
after 1995. 
2
(5) Since fiscal year 2000, Congress has, on a 
3
bipartisan basis, lifted the 25 percent cap 15 times, 
4
including retroactively for calendar years 2006–2008 
5
during the Bush Administration. 
6
(6) In 2019, the Department of State reported 
7
to Congress the following impacts of growing United 
8
States arrears to the UN: ‘‘(1) Loss of vote or in-
9
ability to be a member of governing bodies; (2) Di-
10
minished U.S. standing and diminished ability to 
11
pursue U.S. priorities; (3) Reduced U.S. ability to 
12
promote increased oversight and accountability 
13
through reforms that promote efficiency, cost sav-
14
ings, and improved management practices; (4) Re-
15
duced standing needed to successfully promote quali-
16
fied U.S. citizens to assume senior management 
17
roles; and (5) Impairments of peacekeeping missions 
18
to operate, including addressing objectives that may 
19
directly impact the national security of the United 
20
States’’. 
21
(7) United States ongoing accrual of arrears is 
22
having a negative impact on the financial health of 
23
UN peacekeeping with low and middle-income coun-
24
tries, who voluntarily provide the bulk of the troops, 
25

•HR 4420 IH
police, and equipment to these missions, not being 
1
adequately reimbursed for their contributions and 
2
shouldering an increasing financial burden. 
3
(8) The People’s Republic of China is now the 
4
second largest financial contributor to UN peace-
5
keeping, having gone from an assessment rate of 
6
just 3 percent in 2008 to more than 15 percent in 
7
2021, and is the ninth largest troop-contributor to 
8
UN missions, providing more personnel than the 
9
other four permanent members of the Security 
10
Council combined. 
11
(9) The People’s Republic of China has used 
12
this expanded influence to argue against human 
13
rights, civilian protection, and gender-based violence 
14
personnel within UN peacekeeping operations, in 
15
part using United States funding shortfalls as a pre-
16
text to downsize peacekeeping missions. 
17
(10) Prior to fiscal year 2017, when the United 
18
States was paying its peacekeeping dues at the full 
19
assessed rate, the United States and the UN worked 
20
together to institute a number of cost-saving and ef-
21
ficiency reforms, including reducing the cost per 
22
peacekeeper by 18 percent, reducing the number of 
23
support staff, and shortening the timeline between 
24

•HR 4420 IH
when a mission is mandated and when personnel, 
1
equipment, and services are fully deployed. 
2
(11) Beginning in 2015 and with the support of 
3
the United States, the UN strengthened measures to 
4
combat sexual abuse and exploitation by peace-
5
keepers, including strict timelines for completing in-
6
vestigations; immediate response teams inside peace-
7
keeping missions to handle allegations; suspending 
8
payments to countries whose troops face credible al-
9
legations of misconduct; repatriation of units en-
10
gaged in systematic abuse; establishing an online 
11
database to track allegations and investigations; ap-
12
pointing the first Special Coordinator on Improving 
13
the United Nations Response to Sexual Exploitation 
14
and Abuse and the first Victims’ Rights Advocate; 
15
and establishing a trust fund to support and assist 
16
victims. 
17
(12) Improving U.S. financial standing at the 
18
UN would allow the U.S. to more effectively advo-
19
cate for a range of reform efforts, including sup-
20
porting strategies that have been particularly effec-
21
tive in reducing sexual and gender-based violence 
22
where peacekeepers operate, while also continuing to 
23
strengthen measures to end instances of sexual ex-
24
ploitation and abuse in UN peacekeeping operations. 
25

•HR 4420 IH
(13) In 2021, the top positions at nine UN spe-
1
cialized agencies, funds, and programs will be de-
2
cided, and the United States will be better posi-
3
tioned to argue for its own preferred candidates at 
4
UN entities if it is in good financial standing at the 
5
UN. 
6
(14) In 2018, during the triennial scales of as-
7
sessment rate negotiations, the United States was 
8
unable to deliver significant changes in rates due in 
9
part to outstanding arrears. 
10
(15) In 2021, the scale of assessments negotia-
11
tions will occur again and a demonstrated willing-
12
ness to pay United States assessments in full will 
13
play an important role in garnering support from 
14
other UN member states.
