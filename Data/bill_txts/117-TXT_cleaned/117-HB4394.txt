Congress finds the following:

•HR 4394 IH
(1) Between 2010 and 2020, California’s elec-
1
tricity prices jumped by 39.5 percent, which was the 
2
biggest increase of any State in the United States. 
3
(2) In 2020, electricity prices increased by 7.5 
4
percent in California, and electricity prices were the 
5
third highest in the continental United States. 
6
(3) Higher electricity prices affect the poor the 
7
most, including those who are aging, ill, and on fixed 
8
incomes. 
9
(4) More than 800,000 homes and businesses in 
10
California lost power in August 2020. 
11
(5) One third of California’s energy is imported 
12
from other States, and such States may choose to 
13
serve their own citizens first as was the case in 
14
2020, leaving Californians in the dark. 
15
(6) State regulators in 2013 closed the San 
16
Onofre nuclear power plant that supplied electricity 
17
to 1.4 million households. 
18
(7) Following the closure of the San Onofre nu-
19
clear power plant, CO2 from California-based elec-
20
tricity greenhouse gas generation started increasing. 
21
(8) In 2018, former California Governor Jerry 
22
Brown issued Executive Order B–55–18, mandating 
23
that California achieve carbon neutrality no later 
24
than 2045.

(9) In 2018, California regulators approved the 
1
request to shut down both of Diablo Canyon’s nu-
2
clear reactors, totaling 2,240 megawatts, when their 
3
operating licenses expire in 2024 and 2025. Cali-
4
fornia regulators also made a commitment to pre-
5
vent an increase in global warming emissions due to 
6
Diablo Canyon’s closure, which was codified into law 
7
by the State legislature in 2018. 
8
(10) Diablo Canyon produces about 18,000 
9
gigawatt-hours of electricity annually, which ac-
10
counts for nearly 10 percent of California’s electric 
11
generation. 
12
(11) Based on the California Association of 
13
Independent Operators modeling assessment of the 
14
California Public Utilities Commission’s 38 million 
15
metric ton greenhouse gas target portfolio, the 2025 
16
closure of Diablo Canyon power plant would con-
17
tribute to a significant resource deficiency totaling 
18
3,493 megawatts in effective capacity in 2026. 
19
(12) Nuclear energy generates nearly 20 per-
20
cent of the electricity in the United States, providing 
21
more than 50 percent of the carbon-free electricity 
22
in the United States. 
23
(13) A report by the Brattle Group found that 
24
the nuclear energy industry annually avoids more

than 471 million metric tons of carbon emissions, 
1
which amounts to over $24 billion in annual savings. 
2
(14) The closure of Diablo Canyon power plant 
3
comes at the very time when solar panel prices have 
4
already increased 18 percent this year, after years of 
5
falling prices. 
6
(15) California’s plans to electrify vehicles could 
7
raise demand for electricity by 25 percent.

(a) STATE PERMITS.—Notwithstanding any other 
11
provision of law, California shall issue any permits, li-

censes, or other authorizations to the owner or operator

of the Diablo Canyon power plant that are necessary for 
14
the continued operation of the plant. 
15
(b) FEDERAL
LICENSING.—Notwithstanding any 
16
other provision of law, the Nuclear Regulatory Commis-
17
sion shall issue to the owner or operator of the Diablo 
18
Canyon power plant a license to expand the plant’s gener-
19
ating capacity by 8,000 megawatts.
