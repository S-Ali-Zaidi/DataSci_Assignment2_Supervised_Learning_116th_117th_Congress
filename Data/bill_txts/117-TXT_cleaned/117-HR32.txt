In his conduct of the office of President of the United

•HRES 32 IH 
On January 2, 2021, President Trump violated his 
1
constitutional duty to take care that the laws of the 
2
United States be faithfully executed when, on a recorded 
3
call, he repeatedly asked Georgia Secretary of State Brad 
4
Raffensperger to overturn the finalized and verified results 
5
of the November 2020 Presidential election in the State 
6
of Georgia. President Trump misused the power of his of-
7
fice by threatening an elected official with unspecified con-
8
sequences if he failed to pursue the President’s false 
9
claims and attempting to coerce an elected official to com-
10
mit fraud. His actions and statements on this call amount-
11
ed to interference with the impartial election process in 
12
direct contravention of both Federal law and the laws of 
13
the State of Georgia. 
14
In all of this, Donald John Trump has acted in a 
15
manner contrary to his trust as President and subversive 
16
of constitutional government, to the great prejudice of the 
17
cause of law and justice and to the manifest injury of the 
18
people of the United States. 
19
Wherefore, Donald John Trump, by such conduct, 
20
warrants impeachment and trial, removal from office, and 
21
disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, 
22
trust, or profit under the United States.

fully to execute the office of President of the United States

and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect, and defend 
2
the Constitution of the United States, and in violation of 
3
his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faith-
4
fully executed—Donald John Trump has abused the pow-
5
ers of the Presidency to incite violence and orchestrate an 
6
attempted coup against our country.

On January 6, 2021, President Trump encouraged 
8
individuals to travel to Washington, DC, with the sole pur-
9
pose of inciting violence and obstructing Congress in en-
10
gaging in its constitutionally mandated legislative business 
11
of certifying the electoral college results of the 2020 elec-
12
tion. He incited a crowd of supporters in Washington, DC, 
13
to violently attack the United States Capitol while both 
14
chambers of Congress were in session, saying ‘‘You’ll 
15
never take back our country with weakness. You have to 
16
show strength and you have to be strong’’. After those 
17
supporters had violently breached the Capitol, he put out 
18
a further statement repeating his false claims of election 
19
fraud and telling the members of the mob, ‘‘We love you, 
20
you’re very special’’.

In all of this, Donald John Trump has acted in a
