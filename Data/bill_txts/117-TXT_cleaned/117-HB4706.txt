tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

4
tional Historic Site Act’’.

SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.

SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
3
Congress finds as follows: 
4
(1) The Blackwell School, located at 501 South 
5
Abbott Street, in Marfa, Presidio County, Texas, is 
6
associated with the period of racial segregation in 
7
Marfa public schools and is the sole extant property 
8
directly associated with Hispanic education in the 
9
community, the remaining buildings having been 
10
torn down after the school closed in 1965. 
11
(2) The Blackwell School is a tangible reminder 
12
of a time when the practice of ‘‘separate but equal’’ 
13
dominated education and social systems. Despite 
14
being categorized as ‘‘white’’ by Texas law, Mexican 
15
Americans were regularly excluded from commin-
16
gling with Anglos at barbershops, restaurants, fu-
17
neral homes, theaters, churches, and schools. 
18
(3) The spectrum of experiences of students 
19
and teachers at the Blackwell School constitute an 
20
important record of life in a segregated school in the 
21
context of the history of Texas and America. 
22
(4) Mexican and Mexican American culture and 
23
history in Marfa is tied to the Blackwell School, 
24
which for more than 50 years served as a leading 
25

feature of the Hispanic community, illustrating the 
1
challenge of maintaining cultural identity in a domi-
2
nant Anglo society. Yet today, Hispanic influences 
3
are seen in Marfa’s social and religious organiza-
4
tions, business and government institutions, and 
5
shared experiences of language, food, and music. 
6
(5) The historic Blackwell School building is a 
7
physical record of the longevity and beauty of the 
8
distinctive design and craftsmanship informed by 
9
both traditional techniques and materials, and the 
10
transition from purely the vernacular to the period 
11
of materials, design, and workmanship made avail-
12
able after the arrival of the railroad. The original 
13
historic school building and grounds on which it 
14
stands provide an authentic setting to commemorate 
15
and interpret the history of the Blackwell School. 
16
(6) The Blackwell School is closely associated 
17
with the broad patterns of local, State, and national 
18
history in the area of school segregation. Mexicans 
19
and other members of the Latin American diaspora 
20
have placed a high value upon education as a means 
21
of economic, social, and political advancement. 
22
(7) Mexican Americans and other members of 
23
the Latin American diaspora have placed a high 
24
value upon education as a means of economic, social,

and political advancement. However, Hispanics and 
1
Latinos have not always had equitable opportunities 
2
and access to quality educational facilities in the 
3
United States.
