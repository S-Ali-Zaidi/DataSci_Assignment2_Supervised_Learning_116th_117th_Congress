RESOLUTION 
Urging the United States Olympic Committee, the Inter-
national Olympic Committee, and the Olympic Commit-
tees of other countries to take certain actions with re-
spect to the 2022 Winter Olympic Games. 
Whereas the annual report of the Congressional-Executive 
Commission on China for 2020 indicates— 
(1) the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and the 
Chinese Communist Party (CCP) have taken unprece-
dented steps in the last year to extend their repressive 
policies through censorship, intimidation, and the deten-
tion of individuals and groups for exercising their funda-
mental human rights, especially in the Xinjiang Uyghur 
Autonomous Region (XUAR) and Hong Kong;

(2) in XUAR, it is now estimated that up to 1.8 mil-
lion Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Hui, and others have 
been arbitrarily detained in a system of extrajudicial 
mass internment camps where they are subjected to 
forced labor, torture, and political indoctrination; 
(3) forced labor in the XUAR is widespread and sys-
tematic and exists within the mass internment camps and 
elsewhere throughout the region, as part of a targeted 
campaign of repression against Turkic and Muslim mi-
norities; 
(4) detention of Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Hui, 
and others in mass internment camps in the XUAR since 
around April 2017, and authorities have also increasingly 
sentenced ethnic minority individuals to lengthy prison 
terms for political reasons since 2017; 
(5) in Hong Kong, the ‘‘one country, two systems’’ 
framework has been dismantled, severely undermining 
the rule of law and respect for human rights that the ter-
ritory has long enjoyed, and authorities arrested pro-
democracy leaders, prevented journalists from reporting, 
applied political pressure on the judiciary, and allowed 
the Hong Kong Police Force to grow increasingly abusive 
toward nonviolent protesters; and 
(6) the PRC and CCP have further intensified cam-
paigns that aim to bring religion in China under closer 
official control, and authorities have expanded campaigns 
to target, control, and surveil not only religions deemed 
‘‘foreign’’ like Christianity, Islam, and Tibetan Bud-
dhism, but also traditional Chinese religions; 
Whereas, on September 29, 2020, the United States House 
of Representatives China Task Force issued its final re-
port, which found that—

(1) right now, upwards of a million Uyghurs and 
other religious and ethnic minorities in the PRC are 
being held against their will in concentration camps in 
the XUAR; 
(2) CCP authorities are tearing families apart, sub-
jecting targeted ethnic groups to forced abortion, forced 
sterilization, and involuntary birth control, as well as 
other forms of heinous abuse and indoctrination; and 
(3) these concentration camps are being used as a 
feeder system for forced labor not only in Xinjiang, but 
throughout the PRC economy, and the Australian Stra-
tegic Policy Institute found in 2020 that the supply 
chains of at least 82 global brands are using forced 
Uyghur labor; 
Whereas, on February 3, 2021, the British Broadcasting 
Corporation (BBC) reported several shocking and appall-
ing firsthand accounts of an organized system of mass 
rape, sexual abuse, and torture of the Uyghurs in the 
XUAR; 
Whereas, on February 11, 2021, the PRC banned the BBC 
for its reporting on human rights abuses in XUAR; 
Whereas the Department of State’s 2020 Trafficking in Per-
sons Report (TIP) relating to the People’s Republic of 
China— 
(1) indicates that the Trafficking in Victims Protec-
tion Act defines ‘‘severe forms’’ of trafficking in persons 
as: sex trafficking in which a commercial sex act is in-
duced by force, fraud, or coercion, or in which the person 
induced to perform such an act has not attained 18 years 
of age; or the recruitment, harboring, transportation, 
provision, or obtaining of a person for labor or services, 
through the use of force, fraud, or coercion for the pur-

pose of subjection to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt 
bondage, or slavery; 
(2) states that Tier 3 is the most severe category for 
trafficking activity and defines Tier 3 as ‘‘countries 
whose governments do not fully comply with the min-
imum standards and are not making significant efforts to 
do so’’; and 
(3) indicates that the PRC has been designated in 
Tier 3 by the Department of State in the TIP since 
2017; 
Whereas, on January 19, 2021, the former Secretary of State 
Mike Pompeo determined that the PRC, under the direc-
tion and control of the CCP, has committed genocide 
against the predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and other 
ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang, and he 
determined that the genocide is ongoing, and that we are 
witnessing the systematic attempt to destroy Uyghurs by 
the Chinese party-state; 
Whereas, on January 19, 2021, Secretary of State Antony 
Blinken in his testimony before the Senate Committee on 
Foreign Relations agreed with Secretary Pompeo’s deter-
mination when stating, ‘‘Forcing men, women, and chil-
dren into concentration camps, trying to in effect reedu-
cate them to be adherents to the Chinese Communist 
Party—all of that speaks to an effort to commit geno-
cide’’; 
Whereas, on September 15, 2020, 23 human rights groups 
signed an open letter of concern to governments on 
crimes against humanity and genocide against Uyghurs 
in China, and the letter states, ‘‘We, the undersigned 
human rights and genocide prevention organizations, and 
individual practitioners, are deeply concerned over mount-

ing evidence that Chinese government policies targeting 
Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslim-majority peoples in 
the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China 
strongly suggests that crimes against humanity and geno-
cide are taking place’’; 
Whereas, on September 21, 2020, the House of Representa-
tives staff on the Foreign Affairs Committee released a 
report titled, ‘‘The Origins of the COVID–19 Global Pan-
demic, Including the Roles of the Chinese Communist 
Party and the World Health Organization’’, that indi-
cates— 
(1) sometime in early to mid-November 2019, a 
novel coronavirus first infected humans in Wuhan, the 
capital of Hubei Province in the central region of the 
PRC; 
(2) failure of the CCP to notify the World Health 
Organization (WHO) about the outbreak of a novel dis-
ease within China’s borders; 
(3) the repeated failure of the CCP to notify the 
WHO of cases meeting the WHO definition of SARS; 
(4) the CCP’s shuttering of the Shanghai lab that 
published the SARS–CoV–2 genome online; 
(5) the lack of new case announcements during CCP 
political meetings between January 6, 2020, and January 
17, 2020; 
(6) the suppression of reports from medical doctors 
within the PRC providing evidence of human-to-human 
transmission; and 
(7) 6 days of undisclosed response during January, 
during which General Secretary Xi Jinping and other 
senior CCP officials kept secret their knowledge that 
human-to-human transmission was occurring and that a 
pandemic was likely;

Whereas the PRC and CCP are violating international human 
rights laws and norms, including— 
(1) the International Convention on the Elimination 
of All Forms of Racial Discrimination; 
(2) the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment; 
(3) the International Covenant on Civil and Political

Whereas, the Olympic Games is a celebration of international 
culture, a festival of humanity, and is intended to be 
independent of political, ideological, and diplomatic dis-
agreements. However, hosting the 2022 Winter Olympics 
Games in the PRC, where organized atrocities in the 
XUAR are ongoing; where the freedoms of Hong Kong’s 
citizens are being trampled; where the fundamental right 
to worship is brutally persecuted; and in the wake of the 
ongoing global devastation from COVID–19; would be 
immoral, unethical, and wrong: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives urges—
