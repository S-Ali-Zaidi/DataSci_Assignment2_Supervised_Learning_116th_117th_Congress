RESOLUTION 
Third Reconstruction: Fully addressing poverty and low 
wages from the bottom up. 
Whereas there are over 140 million people who are poor, low- 
wealth, or just one emergency away from economic ruin 
in the United States; 
Whereas the injustice of poverty and low wealth is deeply en-
twined with the injustices of systemic racism, the denial 
of health care and ecological devastation, militarism, and 
the distorted moral narrative of religious nationalism that

seeks to blame the poor instead of addressing systems 
that cause poverty; 
Whereas there are devastating consequences to these injus-
tices, including that 250,000 die every year due to pov-
erty and inequality alone; 
Whereas our entire society suffers when over 40 percent of 
the country cannot fulfill their potential or fully partici-
pate in society; 
Whereas these widespread conditions cannot be explained by 
blaming individual behaviors, nor are they inherent to our 
economy or society, but rather they are created and sus-
tained by unjust and immoral laws, policies, systems, and 
structures; 
Whereas we need the resolve to pass moral and just laws and 
policies that fully address these interlocking injustices, 
which have only deepened during the COVID–19 pan-
demic; 
Whereas before the pandemic, 140 million people were poor, 
low-wealth, or one emergency away from economic ruin, 
including 52 percent of children (39 million), 45 percent 
of women (74 million), 60 percent of Black people (24 
million), 64 percent of Latina/o people (38 million), 40 
percent of Asian and Pacific Islander people (8 million), 
59 percent of Native and Indigenous people (2 million), 
and 33 percent of White people (66 million); 
Whereas the 140 million live in every region of the Nation, 
including 50 million in the South (Alabama, Arkansas, 
Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Mis-
sissippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, 
Texas, Virginia), over 40 million in Appalachia (Alabama,

lina, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, South Carolina, 
Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia), with 8.6 million in 
New York alone, over 40 million in the Southwest/Border 
(Arizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, 
Texas, Utah), with 20 million in California alone, 20 mil-
lion in the Midwest deindustrialized States (Ohio, Penn-
sylvania, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, Wisconsin), 11 mil-
lion in the Northeast (Connecticut, Delaware, Massachu-
setts, Maryland, Maine, New Hampshire, New Jersey, 
Rhode Island, Vermont), over 7 million in the Northwest 
(Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, Washington, Wyoming), nearly 7 
million in the Great Plains (Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, 
Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, 
South Dakota), nearly 700,000 in Hawaii, and 300,000 
in Washington, DC; 
Whereas systemic racism takes the form of laws and policies 
that target people of color, especially poor people of color, 
to create and deepen inequities in democracy, health, eco-
nomic security, education, housing, jobs, policing, incar-
ceration, criminalization, and immigration, which has 
contributed to the disproportionate impact of COVID–19 
on poor communities of color; 
Whereas, since 2010, at least 25 States had passed new voter 
restrictions, imposing racist gerrymandering and redis-
tricting, restricting early voting and voting hours, purg-
ing voter rolls, closing polling stations, and instituting 
onerous voter ID laws, and since the 2020 elections, 43 
States have introduced over 250 new bills that further 
these restrictions and limit mail-in voting; 
Whereas voter suppression laws disproportionately target 
poor, Black, brown, and Native people, they also pave the 
way for immoral policies that deny health care, living

wages, immigrant rights, women’s rights, LGBTQ+ 
rights, and more; 
Whereas nearly 50 million people are working for low wages, 
including at least 40 percent of Black and Latina/o work-
ers and approximately 30 percent of White workers, and 
a majority (59 percent) of low-wage workers are women; 
Whereas approximately 6 million essential workers are immi-
grants, including 5 million undocumented immigrants, 
and Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders are the high-
est represented subgroup among essential workers; 
Whereas more than 25 million workers have been directly 
hurt by the economic impacts of the pandemic, and more 
than half of the low-wage jobs that were lost have not re-
turned; 
Whereas women carry a disproportionate share of unpaid 
care work, which would total $1.5 trillion at the current 
minimum wage ($7.25); 
Whereas the average hourly wage that a full-time worker re-
quires to afford a modest two-bedroom apartment is over 
$23 per hour; 
Whereas there are 30 to 40 million people at risk of home-
lessness, and an estimated 25 to 50 million people are 
facing food insecurity, including a disproportionate share 
of Black, Latina/o, American Indian, Alaska Native, Na-
tive Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, and multiracial house-
holds; 
Whereas of the approximately 60 million adults with disabil-
ities in the country, 26 percent are living below the pov-
erty line, 10 percent are uninsured, and 7 million stu-
dents with disabilities are enrolled in our public schools;

•HRES 438 IH 
Whereas the official poverty measure (OPM) is an inadequate 
measure that does not account for today’s cost of living, 
including child care, health insurance, and transpor-
tation, and even the supplemental poverty measure 
(SPM) does not account for all modern necessities or 
debt burdens that siphon household resources away from 
meeting basic needs; 
Whereas the average cost of living in the Nation amounts to 
more than twice the OPM and SPM, close to $60,000 for 
a household of four; 
Whereas due to these limitations in the measure of poverty, 
social welfare and antipoverty programs have been under-
funded, to the extent that only one-quarter of eligible 
families received TANF or Federal housing assistance, 
SNAP (food stamps) were reduced in 2017 to approxi-
mately $1.40 per meal, and Head Start reaches only 54 
percent of eligible 3- to 4-year-olds; 
Whereas household debt burdens have grown to over $14 tril-
lion, and half of our families are having difficulty meet-
ing usual household expenses, including approximately 
three-quarters of low-income households and Black and 
Latina/o families; 
Whereas alongside mounting poverty, low wealth, debt, and 
economic desperation, poor communities and poor com-
munities of color are hit first and worst by climate 
change, pollution, extreme weather, climate disaster, eco-
logical devastation, and related health disparities, includ-
ing during the COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas an expansion of oil and fossil fuel infrastructure led 
to over 5,000 significant oil and gas leaks or ruptures on 
United States pipelines, more than 2,400 oil spills in

United States waters, and 1,100 coal ash ponds, all of 
which are disproportionately proximate to poor commu-
nities; 
Whereas decades of residential segregation continue to ex-
pose, especially, Black communities to greater air pollu-
tion, as well as Latina/o, Asian and Pacific Islander, and 
poor and low-wealth communities; 
Whereas Native and Indigenous reservations cover just 2 per-
cent of the United States, and ancestral and sacred lands 
are at risk of being devastated by mining, extraction, and 
pollution, because of their vast mineral and natural 
wealth; 
Whereas tens of millions of Americans cannot afford access 
to clean water, 44 million people are living with water 
systems that violated the Safe Drinking Water Act, and 
approximately 540,000 households lack access to com-
plete plumbing, with Native American households more 
likely to face water access issues than other households; 
Whereas despite these threats to health, 119 rural hospitals 
have been closed in 41 States since 2010, and 87 million 
people were uninsured or underinsured leading into the 
COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas the United States has the worst-ranking public 
health outcomes among our peer countries, including the 
lowest life expectancy and highest infant and maternal 
mortality rates, even though we spend more than twice 
the amount per capita on health expenditures compared 
to other industrialized nations; 
Whereas rather than addressing these pressing conditions im-
pacting our health, well-being, and general welfare, 53 
cents of every Federal discretionary dollar go to the Pen-

tagon, while only 15 cents go toward antipoverty pro-
grams; 
Whereas experts have identified up to $350 billion in defense 
spending cuts that would both save resources and keep 
the country safe and secure; 
Whereas the United States wars since 2001 have killed more 
than 800,000 people and displaced 37 million more; 
Whereas local and State law enforcement agencies have re-
ceived over $7.4 billion worth of equipment from the De-
partment of Defense since 1990; 
Whereas of the 19 million veterans in the Nation, 5.4 million 
are on disability, nearly 38,000 are homeless, and 7 to 
18 percent of military families and veterans are on food 
assistance; 
Whereas the United States is home to less than 5 percent of 
the world’s population, but accounts for 20 percent of the 
world’s incarcerated people, most of whom are poor and 
the poorest of whom are women and people of color, and 
74 percent of those held in jail have not been convicted 
of any crime, but are too poor to be free before trial; 
Whereas there have been over 1,000 police killings every year 
since 2013, with Black, Native, and Indigenous people 
more likely to be killed by police, yet 98 percent of police 
killings since 2013 have not resulted in a criminal 
charge; 
Whereas nearly every American will know a gun violence vic-
tim in their lifetimes; 
Whereas our strength as a Nation is greater when we wel-
come newcomers and immigrants, and immigrant families 
are vital members of our communities, yet our broken im-
migration system is harmful to immigrants and our soci-

ety as a whole, it is plagued by backlogs, processing 
delays, and overly complex policies, it criminalizes migra-
tion and prioritizes detention, deportation, and the eco-
nomic and political exclusion of immigrants, and it relies 
on a largely for-profit detention system that detains tens 
of thousands of people and separates families; 
Whereas although immigrants, regardless of status, pay more 
than $490 billion in taxes, they are virtually excluded 
from all safety net programs; 
Whereas White supremacist and far-right extremist groups 
have been recognized by the Federal Government as a 
predominant domestic security threat, however, every 
year we spend over $1 trillion in endless wars, mass in-
carceration, policing, immigration, and border enforce-
ment, none of which make us safer; 
Whereas billionaires have added more than $1.3 trillion to 
their collective wealth from March 2020 to February 
2021; 
Whereas these interlocking injustices are precipitating the 
deconstruction of our democracy and imposing unbear-
able costs to our economy, including that $1 trillion is 
lost every year to the costs of child poverty, $1.9 trillion 
of government revenue was lost by lowering the corporate 
tax rate in 2017, $6.4 trillion has been lost in endless 
wars over the past two decades, the costs of the pandemic 
are estimated to be at least $16 trillion, and inaction on 
climate change threatens the loss of life itself; 
Whereas there was record turnout among the 64 million poor 
and low-income eligible voters in the 2020 elections, who 
did not vote for a return to ‘‘normal’’;

Whereas moral policy that prioritizes the 140 million can lift 
this Nation from the bottom up, rather than waiting for 
wealth to trickle down; and 
Whereas drawing on the transformational history of the first 
Reconstruction after the Civil War and the second Recon-
struction of the civil rights struggles in the 20th century, 
this moment demands a third Reconstruction to revive 
our political commitment to implement moral laws and
