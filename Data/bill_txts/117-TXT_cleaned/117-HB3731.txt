SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

Congress finds that—

•HR 3731 IH
(1) communities throughout the United States, 
1
including communities in the States of California, 
2
Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Kansas, Maine, Mary-
3
land, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Or-
4
egon, Vermont, and Wisconsin, are tasked with deal-
5
ing with stranded nuclear waste; 
6
(2) communities affected by stranded nuclear 
7
waste are de facto interim nuclear waste storage 
8
sites; 
9
(3) the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (42 
10
U.S.C. 10101 et seq.)— 
11
(A) directed the Secretary of Energy to 
12
make annual impact assistance payments to 
13
States or appropriate units of local government 
14
to mitigate the social and economic impacts of 
15
the establishment and operation of interim nu-
16
clear waste storage capacity within the jurisdic-
17
tional boundaries of an affected community; 
18
and 
19
(B) established the rate for impact assist-
20
ance payments at $15 per kilogram of spent 
21
nuclear fuel; 
22
(4) decommissioning a commercial nuclear 
23
power plant is often catastrophic for the host com-

munity because nuclear power plants are major em-
1
ployers and the primary source of local tax revenue; 
2
(5) stranded nuclear waste is a profound obsta-
3
cle to future economic growth, deterring potential 
4
employers and residents from considering the host 
5
community; 
6
(6) stranded nuclear waste prevents economic 
7
development in communities in which the stranded 
8
nuclear waste is located; 
9
(7) stranded nuclear waste prevents commu-
10
nities from redeveloping sites where nuclear power 
11
plants previously operated which further inhibits tax 
12
revenues; and 
13
(8) it is critical to provide resources to commu-
14
nities that— 
15
(A) are challenged by stranded nuclear 
16
waste; or 
17
(B) will be challenged by stranded nuclear 
18
waste during the 10-year period beginning on 
19
the date of enactment of this Act.
