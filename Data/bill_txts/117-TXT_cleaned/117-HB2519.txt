•HR 2519 IH
(1) from 1880 through 2015, global tempera-
1
tures have increased by about 1.06 degrees Celsius; 
2
(2) the vast majority of global warming that 
3
has occurred over the past 50 years was due to 
4
human activities, primarily the burning of fossil 
5
fuels; 
6
(3) emissions of greenhouse gases and atmos-
7
pheric concentrations of greenhouse gases continue 
8
to rise, which results in a continued warming trend; 
9
(4) global warming already has a significant im-
10
pact on the economy, including the farming, fishing, 
11
forestry, and recreation industries; 
12
(5) the significant impacts of global warming 
13
that are already occurring will be amplified by a 
14
global temperature increase of 2 degrees Celsius, 
15
which will lead to increased droughts, rising seas, 
16
mass 
extinctions, 
heat 
waves, 
desertification, 
17
wildfires, acidifying oceans, significant economic dis-
18
ruption, and security threats; 
19
(6) to avoid exceeding 2 degrees Celsius warm-
20
ing, at least 80 percent of carbon from proven fossil 
21
fuel reserves must be kept in the ground; 
22
(7) the potential emissions resulting from ex-
23
tracting and burning all fossil fuels on Federal land

and waters amounts to a significant percentage of 
1
the greenhouse gas emissions limit; and 
2
(8) ending new leases for fossil fuels will pre-
3
vent the release of 90 percent of the potential emis-
4
sions from Federal fossil fuels. 
5
(b) STATEMENT OF POLICY.—It is the policy of the 
6
United States that— 
7
(1) Federal land and waters should be managed 
8
for the benefit of the people of the United States— 
9
(A) to avoid the most dangerous impacts 
10
of climate change; and 
11
(B) to promote a rapid transition to a 
12
clean energy economy by keeping fossil fuels in 
13
the ground; and 
14
(2) the Federal Government should pursue 
15
management of Federal land and waters for the ben-
16
efit of the people of the United States by not issuing 
17
any new lease or renewing any nonproducing lease 
18
for coal, oil, or natural gas in any Federal land or 
19
waters.
