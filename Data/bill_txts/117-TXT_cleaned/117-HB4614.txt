7
(1) Giant sequoia trees only naturally grow in 
8
California on the western slopes of the Sierra Ne-
9
vada Mountains. 
10
(2) Mature giant sequoia trees can be up to 
11
2,000 years old. 
12
(3) Thirty of the largest giant sequoia trees in 
13
the world are located in Sequoia and Kings Canyon 
14
National Parks, with many other large, old-growth 
15
trees in the Sequoia National Forest. 
16
(4) On August 19, 2020, the lightning-ignited 
17
Castle Fire and another fire were discovered in the 
18
Sequoia National Forest, ultimately named the SQF 
19
Complex Fire. 
20
(5) The SQF Complex Fire burned over 
21
170,000 acres, primarily in the Sequoia National 
22
Forest. 
23
(6) According to a Federal interagency report, 
24
between 7,500 and 10,600 large giant sequoia trees, 
25

•HR 4614 IH
representing 10 to 14 percent of the world’s giant 
1
sequoia tree population, were killed in the SQF

3
(7) According to the San Francisco Chronicle, 
4
the world’s ninth largest giant sequoia tree, the 
5
King Arthur Tree, was destroyed by the SQF Com-
6
plex Fire. 
7
(8) Giant sequoia trees play an important role 
8
in the region’s ecosystem. 
9
(9) Many communities near giant sequoia 
10
groves depend on these unique natural wonders to 
11
help support their local economies through tourism.

13
cient giant sequoia trees for current and future gen-
14
erations to see and enjoy.
