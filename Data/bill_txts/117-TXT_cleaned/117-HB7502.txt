SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Billionaires have disproportionately bene-
3
fitted from financial gains during the pandemic as 
4
their collective net worth grew by $1.7 trillion since 
5
the beginning of the pandemic as employment for 
6
low-wage workers fell by 36.7 percent at the trough 
7
of the pandemic in April 2020. 
8
(2) The 25 wealthiest billionaires in America 
9
made $401 billion from 2014 to 2018 and paid an 
10
effective tax rate of 3.4 percent. 
11
(3) The wealthiest 400 households in America 
12
paid an average effective tax rate of just 8.2 percent 
13
between 2010 and 2018. 
14
(4) A gradual tax on the unrealized capital 
15
gains of billionaires from tradable and non-tradable 
16
assets could raise more than $1 trillion over 10 
17
years. 
18
(5) Investing revenue from such a tax in chil-
19
dren at birth, particularly in the first 1000 days of 
20
life, would support children’s healthy physical devel-
21
opment, brain development, social-emotional health, 
22
and long-term well-being.

net worth of a taxpayer and the deemed sale-price

reasonable knowledge of relevant facts. The value of

7
section, any feature of an asset that was added with

the intent, and has the effect, of reducing the value

or other discount shall be taken into account if it
