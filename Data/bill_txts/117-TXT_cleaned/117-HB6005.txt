A BILL 
To establish certain duties for pharmacies to ensure provision 
of Food and Drug Administration-approved contracep-
tion, medication related to contraception, and for other 
purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Access to Birth Control 
4
Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds as follows: 
7
(1) Family planning is basic health care. Access 
8
to contraception helps prevent unintended pregnancy 
9
and control the timing and spacing of planned 
10
births. 
11
(2) As a result of the enactment of the Patient 
12
Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law 
13
111–148), approximately 64,300,000 women had 
14
coverage of the full range of Food and Drug Admin-
15
istration-approved contraceptive methods without 
16
cost sharing in 2020. 
17
(3) The Patient Protection and Affordable Care 
18
Act saved women $1,400,000,000 on birth control 
19
pills alone in 2013.

(4) According to the Centers for Disease Con-
1
trol and Prevention, nearly 2⁄3 of women between the 
2
ages of 15 and 49 are currently using a contracep-
3
tive method. 
4
(5) Although the Centers for Disease Control 
5
and Prevention included family planning in its pub-
6
lished list of the Ten Great Public Health Achieve-
7
ments in the 20th Century, the United States still 
8
has one of the highest rates of unintended preg-
9
nancies among industrialized nations. 
10
(6) Each year, approximately 2,800,000 preg-
11
nancies, nearly half of all pregnancies, in the United 
12
States are unintended. 
13
(7) Access to birth control helps people achieve 
14
their goals of whether, and when, to get pregnant. 
15
Studies show that when people are unable to access 
16
contraceptive care that fits their lives, they are more 
17
likely to face unintended pregnancies. 
18
(8) Contraceptives are used for a range of med-
19
ical purposes in addition to preventing pregnancy, 
20
such as treating abnormal cycles and endometriosis. 
21
(9) The Food and Drug Administration has ap-
22
proved multiple emergency contraceptive methods as 
23
safe and effective in preventing unintended preg-
24
nancy and has approved over-the-counter access to 
25
22:37 Nov 23, 2021

4 
•HR 6005 IH
some forms of emergency contraception for all indi-
1
viduals, regardless of age. If taken soon after unpro-
2
tected sex or primary contraceptive failure, emer-
3
gency contraception can significantly reduce a per-
4
son’s chance of unintended pregnancy. 
5
(10) Legal contraception is a protected funda-
6
mental right in the United States and should not be 
7
impeded by one individual’s personal beliefs. 
8
(11) Reports of pharmacists refusing to fill pre-
9
scriptions for contraceptives, including emergency 
10
contraceptives, or provide emergency contraception 
11
over-the-counter have surfaced in States across the 
12
Nation, including Alabama, Arizona, California, the 
13
District of Columbia, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, 
14
Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Mon-
15
tana, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, 
16
North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Is-
17
land, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, West Virginia, 
18
and Wisconsin. 
19
(12) One-third of women have experienced a 
20
delay in accessing their contraception because of the 
21
ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The Centers for Dis-
22
ease Control and Prevention recognizes the impor-
23
tance of access to contraception, particularly during 
24
the pandemic.

(13) Pregnant people have a much higher risk 
1
of dying once infected with COVID–19, which high-
2
lights the importance of people being able to make 
3
and exercise decisions about whether and when to 
4
become pregnant.
