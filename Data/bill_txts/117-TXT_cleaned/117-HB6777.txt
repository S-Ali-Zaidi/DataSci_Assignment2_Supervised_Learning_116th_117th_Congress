SEC. 2. UKRAINE ANTI-RUSSIAN INSURGENCY. 
1
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
2
gress that— 
3
(1) it is in the national security interests of the 
4
United States to support the sovereignty and terri-
5
torial integrity of Ukraine, and to continue and 
6
deepen the security partnership between the United 
7
States and Ukraine; 
8
(2) aggression and malign influence by Russia 
9
and its proxies in Ukraine are a threat to the sov-
10
ereignty and democratic government of Ukraine; 
11
(3) coordination by the United States with the 
12
North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Organiza-
13
tion for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and 
14
members of the international community can help 
15
strengthen the opposition to the efforts of Russia to 
16
further encroach on the territorial sovereignty and 
17
right to self-determination of Ukraine; 
18
(4) Congress supports efforts to resolve the cri-
19
sis diplomatically, without compromising on the 
20
principles on which the NATO alliance and Euro-
21
pean security rest; and 
22
(5) Congress believes that the principle that na-
23
tions may not change borders by force is central to 
24
the post-World War II international order.
