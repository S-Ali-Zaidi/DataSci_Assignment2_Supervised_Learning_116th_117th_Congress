SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The Northern Triangle countries of El Sal-
3
vador, Guatemala, and Honduras have among the 
4
highest homicide rates in the world. In 2020, there 
5
were— 
6
(A) 19.7 homicides per 100,000 people in 
7
El Salvador; 
8
(B) 15.4 homicides per 100,000 people in 
9
Guatemala; and 
10
(C) 37.6 homicides per 100,000 people in 
11
Honduras. 
12
(2) El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras are 
13
characterized by a high prevalence of drug- and 
14
gang-related violence, murder, and crimes involving 
15
sexual- and gender-based violence against women 
16
and children, including domestic violence, child 
17
abuse, and sexual assault. 
18
(3) In 2019, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Hon-
19
duras were all listed among the 7 countries in the 
20
Latin America and Caribbean region with the high-
21
est rates of femicides (the intentional killing of 
22
women or girls because of their gender). In 2019— 
23
(A) 113 women in El Salvador were vic-
24
tims of femicide; 
25
05:02 Jul 09, 2021

•HR 4017 IH
(B) 160 women in Guatemala were victims 
1
of femicide; and 
2
(C) 299 women in Honduras were victims 
3
of femicide or violent homicide. 
4
(4) In 2015, El Salvador and Honduras were 
5
among the top 3 countries in the world with the 
6
highest child homicides rates, with more than 22 
7
and 32 deaths per 100,000 children, respectively, ac-
8
cording to the nongovernmental organization Save 
9
the Children. 
10
(5) Thousands of women, children, and families 
11
from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras fled 
12
unsafe homes and communities in 2019. 
13
(6) Violent crimes against women and children 
14
are generally assumed to be substantially under-re-
15
ported because the majority of victims lack safe ac-
16
cess to protection and justice. 
17
(7) Impunity for perpetrators of violence 
18
against women is rampant in El Salvador, Guate-
19
mala, and Honduras. There was a 5 percent convic-
20
tion rate for violence against women in El Salvador 
21
in 2016 and 2017. The impunity level for violence 
22
against women in Guatemala was 97.05 percent in 
23
2018. In 2018, there was an impunity rate of 95 
24
percent for violence against women in Honduras.

(8) According to a study conducted by the 
1
Woodrow Wilson International Center for Schol-
2
ars— 
3
(A) childhood experiences with domestic vi-
4
olence in Latin America are a major risk factor 
5
for future criminal behavior; and 
6
(B) 56 percent of incarcerated women and 
7
59 percent of incarcerated men surveyed experi-
8
enced intra-familial violence during childhood.
