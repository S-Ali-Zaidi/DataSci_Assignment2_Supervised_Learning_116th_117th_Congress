5
main at risk of long-term unemployment, and 1 in 
6
4 small businesses in the United States remain at 
7
risk of long-term closure, as a result of the COVID– 
8
19 pandemic; 
9
(3) prior to the COVID–19 pandemic, there 
10
were 2,400,000 workers in the United States em-
11
ployed in the energy efficiency sector, which was 
12
growing at a rate 3 times greater than that of the 
13
overall economy of the United States; 
14
(4) over 300,000 energy efficiency workers re-
15
main unemployed as of January 1, 2021, due to the 
16
COVID–19 pandemic; 
17
(5) nearly 80 percent of energy efficiency work-
18
ers are employed by companies with fewer than 20 
19
employees; 
20
(6) United States small business energy bills 
21
total $60,000,000,000 annually, of which 30 percent 
22
could be saved through energy efficiency improve-
23
ments, 
which

(7) three-quarters of electric and natural gas

utility companies in the United States operate de-
2
mand side management programs to incentivize cus-
3
tomers to make energy efficiency improvements; and 
4
(8) participation rates for small businesses in 
5
demand side management programs are typically 
6
very low because small businesses do not have the 
7
capital to meet the customer contribution that utili-
8
ties require.

(b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this Act are— 
10
(1) to make small businesses more financially 
11
viable through energy efficiency improvements that 
12
lower monthly utility bills; 
13
(2) to restore and create energy efficiency jobs 
14
across the United States; 
15
(3) to provide work and revenue streams for 
16
small businesses in the energy efficiency sector;
