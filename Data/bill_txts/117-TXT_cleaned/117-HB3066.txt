7

States territories, including within the Federal 
1
criminal code. 
2
(2) The territory of Guam has lost significant 
3
revenue due to prolific trafficking of contraband 
4
cigarettes onto the island. 
5
(3) Since Guam had increased its tobacco tax 
6
by 200 percent in 2010, local numbers have indi-
7
cated that at least 98 million cigarettes are untaxed 
8
every three years, amounting to a loss of approxi-
9
mately $14.6 million. 
10
(4) Given its proximity to Asian countries 
11
where tobacco products, including cigarettes, are in-
12
credibly inexpensive, the propensity for cigarette 
13
trafficking leading to tax evasion is greater. 
14
(5) Without the assistance of Federal enforce-
15
ment and resources, Guam remains vulnerable to 
16
cigarette trafficking and is at a high risk for tax 
17
evasion.
