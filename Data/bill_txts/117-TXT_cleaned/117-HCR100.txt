CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of Congress in opposition to the estab-
lishment of a new United States consulate or diplomatic 
mission in Jerusalem for outreach to Palestinians. 
Whereas the United States recognizes sovereign nations’ au-
thority to designate their own capitals; 
Whereas Jerusalem has served as the diplomatic capital of 
Israel for decades and has remained the cultural center 
of Israel and of the Jewish people for millennia; 
Whereas large, bipartisan supermajorities in the Senate and 
the House of Representatives voted for the Jerusalem

•HCON 100 IH 
Embassy Act of 1995 (Public Law 104–45), which 
states, as the policy of the United States— 
(1) ‘‘Jerusalem should remain an undivided city’’; 
(2) ‘‘Jerusalem should be recognized as the capital 
of the State of Israel’’; and 
(3) ‘‘the United States Embassy in Israel should be 
established in Jerusalem’’; 
Whereas, in 2018, the Trump administration relocated the 
United States Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem in accord-
ance with the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995; 
Whereas the Biden administration’s plan to open a United 
States consulate in Jerusalem for outreach to Palestin-
ians could be viewed as a challenge to— 
(1) Israel’s sovereignty over Jerusalem; and 
(2) Jerusalem’s status as an undivided city; 
Whereas such plan has received bipartisan criticism among 
members of the Government of the United States and the 
Government of Israel; 
Whereas the Palestinian Authority has stated that the pur-
pose of opening a United States consulate in Jerusalem 
for outreach to Palestinians is to divide the city; and 
Whereas the opening and maintenance of a new and unneces-
sary consulate in Jerusalem would require a substantial 
expenditure of American taxpayer funds: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate 
1
concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that— 
2
(1) Congress opposes the establishment of a 
3
new United States consulate in Jerusalem for out-
4
reach to Palestinians;

(2) establishing such a consulate would violate 
1
the intent of the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995; 
2
(3) any establishment of a new consulate or 
3
diplomatic mission in Jerusalem should not move

forward without congressional approval through the

passage of new legislation; and 
6
(4) the presence of a United States diplomatic

mission devoted to a non-state actor in Israel’s sov-

ereign capital would be an affront to the territorial 
9
integrity of a long-standing United States partner
