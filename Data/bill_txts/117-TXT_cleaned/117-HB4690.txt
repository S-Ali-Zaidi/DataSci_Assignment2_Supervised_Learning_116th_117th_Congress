9
formation provided or analyzed under

11
apply the following 12-month revenue loss 
12
thresholds in determining whether a fish-

15
cent shall result in a positive deter-
16
mination that a fishery resource dis-
17
aster has occurred.

19
and 80 percent shall be evaluated to

determine whether economic impacts

are extenuating circumstances that

justify using a lower threshold in

making the determination.

‘‘(ii) CHARTER FISHING.—In making

a determination of whether a fishery re-

FISHERIES.—A fishery

SEC. 401. DATA MODERNIZATION. 
3
(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 180 days after the 
4
date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary, acting 
5
through the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, shall 
6
provide to Congress an implementation plan for the Fish-
7
eries Information Management Modernization initiative. 
8
Such plan shall include a description of— 
9
(1) activities for the goals and objectives of the 
10
initiative; 
11
(2) a schedule for implementation; 
12
(3) an estimated budget; 
13
(4) a plan for stakeholder engagement for de-
14
velopment of user-centric systems, processes, and

Congress on progress in carrying out this section. 
4
SEC. 402. EXPANDING AND IMPROVING ELECTRONIC TECH-
5
NOLOGIES. 
6
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.— It is the sense of Con-
7
gress that the use of electronic technologies such as digital 
8
video cameras and monitors, digital recording systems, 
9
and other forms of electronic technology as a complement 
10
to, and in some cases a replacement for, observers may 
11
maintain, increase, or improve the amount and accuracy 
12
of observer and fishery dependent information collected 
13
from fisheries while reducing costs and logistical difficul-
14
ties. To achieve optimum yields while maintaining sustain-
15
able fisheries and healthy ecosystems, managers require 
16
timely, accurate, and comprehensive stock assessment and 
17
catch accounting across all regions and fishing sectors. To 
18
achieve management goals especially in the context of cli-
19
mate change, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Ad-
20
ministration should work to meet evolving management 
21
needs and, in collaboration with industry stakeholders, 
22
identify appropriate data collection technologies and strat-
23
egies. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administra-
24
tion should also consider the use of innovative technology 
25

in fishery independent data collection including stock and

habitat assessments and environmental conditions.

(b) FISHERY

COUNCILS.—Section 
3
303(b)(8) is amended to read as follows: 
4
‘‘(8) require the collection of data necessary for 
5
the conservation and management of the fishery to 
6
be collected from a vessel of the United States en-
7
gaged in fishing for species that are subject to the

plan while that vessel is at-sea through— 
9
‘‘(A) electronic monitoring or other elec-
10
tronic technology; or 
11
‘‘(B) on-board observation, except that 
12
such a vessel shall not be required to carry an 
13
observer on board if the facilities of the vessel 
14
for the quartering of an observer, or for car-
15
rying out observer functions, are so inadequate 
16
or unsafe that the health or safety of the ob-
17
server or the safe operation of the vessel would 
18
be jeopardized;’’. 
19
(c) INFORMATION SYSTEMS.—Section 402(a) (16

(3) by adding at the end the following: 
8
‘‘(3) SECRETARIAL

9
than once every 5 years, the Secretary shall review 
10

4
complex to produce maximum sustainable yield 
5

change, overfishing, inadequate forage, or other

characteristics of or stressors on the stock or
