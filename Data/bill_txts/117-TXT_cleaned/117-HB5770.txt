SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
10
Section 2(a) (16 U.S.C. 1801(a)) is amended by add-
11
ing at the end the following: 
12
‘‘(14) Forage fish are generally small to inter-
13
mediate-sized species, occurring in schools or dense 
14
aggregations, and function as a main pathway for 
15
energy to flow from phyto- and zooplankton to high-
16
er trophic level predators, such as tuna, Alaska pol-
17
lock, and other wildlife, in marine ecosystems. While 
18
most species function as prey of others at some life 
19
stage, especially when small and young, forage fish 
20
maintain this important trophic role throughout 
21
their life. Further, fluctuations in their populations 
22
can result in significant changes in marine commu-

nities and ecosystems. Therefore, particular atten-
1
tion to management of forage fish species, and ad-
2
dressing their unique role in marine ecosystems, is 
3
critical to maintaining ecosystem function and sus-
4
tainable fisheries.’’.

(a) SECRETARY TO DEFINE FORAGE FISH.—Section 
7
305 (16 U.S.C. 1855) is amended by adding at the end 
8
the following: 
9
‘‘(l) FORAGE FISH.—Not later than 6 months after 
10
the date of enactment of the Forage Fish Conservation 
11
Act of 2021, the Secretary shall issue a definition of the 
12
term ‘forage fish’ for the purposes of this Act. In defining 
13
such term, the Secretary shall consider factors including 
14
whether a species covered by such definition, throughout 
15
such species’ lifecycle— 
16
‘‘(1) is at a low trophic level; 
17
‘‘(2) is generally small- to intermediate-sized; 
18
‘‘(3) occurs in schools or other dense aggrega-
19

‘‘(4) contributes significantly to the diets of 
21
other fish, marine mammals, or birds; and

‘‘(5) serves as a conduit for energy transfer to
