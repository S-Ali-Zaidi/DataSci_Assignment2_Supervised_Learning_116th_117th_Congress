(3) On July 24, 1966, Sgt. Pittman’s unit was 
1
moving along a trail near the demilitarized zone in 
2
the Republic of Vietnam when the marines ahead of 
3
them came under attack. 
4
(4) Upon hearing the attack, Sgt. Pittman took 
5
a machine gun and several belts of ammunition and 
6
rushed to aid his comrades. As he moved towards 
7
the attacked marines, Sgt. Pittman came under 
8
heavy fire from two automatic weapons, which he 
9
was able to destroy. 
10
(5) When Sgt. Pittman learned there were addi-
11
tional wounded marines further along the trail, he 
12
endured enemy mortar and gunfire to get to them. 
13
As he reached them, he faced an attack by 30 to 40 
14
enemy fighters. 
15
(6) Sgt. Pittman used a combination of ma-
16
chine-gun fire, an enemy submachine gun, a pistol 
17
from a fallen comrade, and a grenade to cause the 
18
enemy force to withdraw. Due to his courageous ac-
19
tions that day, many of his wounded comrades were 
20
saved.

22
