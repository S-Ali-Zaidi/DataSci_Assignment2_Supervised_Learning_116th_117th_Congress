1
DATA COLLECTION. 
2
(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than one year after the 
3
date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the 
4
Army and the Secretary of the Navy shall jointly carry 
5
out a pilot program to evaluate the feasibility of using 
6
data recorders to monitor, assess, and improve the readi-
7
ness and safety of the operation of military tactical vehi-
8
cles. 
9
(b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of the pilot program 
10
are— 
11
(1) to allow for the automated identification of 
12
hazards and potential hazards on and off military 
13
installations; 
14
(2) to mitigate and increase awareness of haz-
15
ards and potential hazards on and off military in-
16
stallations; 
17
(3) to identify near-miss accidents; 
18
(4) to create a standardized record source for 
19
accident investigations; 
20
(5) to assess individual driver proficiency, risk, 
21
and readiness; 
22
(6) to increase consistency in the implementa-
23
tion of military installation and unit-level range safe-
24
ty programs across military installations and units;

•HR 5108 IH
(7) to evaluate the feasibility of incorporating 
1
metrics generated from data recorders into the safe-
2
ty reporting systems and to the Defense Readiness 
3
Reporting System as a measure of assessing safety 
4
risks, mitigations, and readiness; 
5
(8) to determine the costs and benefits of retro-
6
fitting data recorders on legacy platforms and in-
7
cluding data recorders as a requirement in acquisi-
8
tion of military tactical vehicles; and 
9
(9) any other matters as determined by the 
10
Secretary concerned. 
11
(c) REQUIREMENTS.—In carrying out the pilot pro-
12
gram, the Secretaries shall— 
13
(1) assess the feasibility of using commercial 
14
technology, such as smartphones or technologies 
15
used by insurance companies, as a data recorder; 
16
(2) test and evaluate a minimum of two data 
17
recorders that meet the pilot program requirements; 
18
(3) select a data recorder capable of collecting 
19
and exporting the telemetry data, event data, and 
20
driver identification during operation and accidents; 
21
(4) install and maintain a data recorder on a 
22
sufficient number of each of the covered military 
23
tactical vehicles under subsection (f) at selected in-
24
stallations for statistically significant results;

(5) establish and maintain a database that con-
1
tains telemetry data, driver data, and event data 
2
captured by the data recorder; 
3
(6) regularly generate for each installation 
4
under the pilot program a dataset that is viewable 
5
in widely available mapping software of hazards and 
6
potential hazards based on telemetry data and event 
7
data captured by the data recorders; 
8
(7) generate actionable data sets and statistics 
9
on individual, vehicle, and military installation; 
10
(8) require commanders at the covered military 
11
installations to incorporate the actionable data sets 
12
and statistics into the installation range safety pro-
13
gram; 
14
(9) require unit commanders at the covered 
15
military installations to incorporate the actionable 
16
data sets and statistics into unit driver safety pro-
17
gram; 
18
(10) evaluate the feasibility of integrating data 
19
sets and statistics to improve driver certification and 
20
licensing based on data recorded and generated by 
21
the data recorders; 
22
(11) use open architecture to the maximum ex-
23
tent practicable; and
