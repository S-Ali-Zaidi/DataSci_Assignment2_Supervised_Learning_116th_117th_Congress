COMPETITION KNOWN AS ‘‘PAY-FOR-DELAY’’. 
2
(a) CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND DECLARATION 
3
OF PURPOSES.— 
4
(1) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
5
(A) In 1984, the Drug Price Competition 
6
and Patent Term Restoration Act (Public Law 
7
98–417) (referred to in this Act as the ‘‘1984 
8
Act’’), was enacted with the intent of facili-
9
tating the early entry of generic drugs while 
10
preserving incentives for innovation. 
11
(B) Prescription drugs make up approxi-
12
mately 10 percent of the national health care 
13
spending. 
14
(C) Initially, the 1984 Act was successful 
15
in facilitating generic competition to the benefit 
16
of consumers and health care payers, although 
17
88 percent of all prescriptions dispensed in the 
18
United States are generic drugs, they account 
19
for only 28 percent of all expenditures. 
20
(D) Generic drugs cost substantially less 
21
than brand name drugs, with discounts off the 
22
brand price averaging 80 to 85 percent. 
23
(E) Federal dollars currently account for 
24
over 40 percent of the $325,000,000,000 spent 
25
20:49 Nov 03, 2021
H5237
241 
•HR 5237 IH
on retail prescription drugs, and this share is 
1
expected to rise to 47 percent by 2025. 
2
(F)(i) In recent years, the intent of the 
3
1984 Act has been subverted by certain settle-
4
ment agreements in which brand name compa-
5
nies transfer value to their potential generic 
6
competitors to settle claims that the generic 
7
company is infringing the branded company’s 
8
patents. 
9
(ii) These ‘‘reverse payment’’ settlement 
10
agreements— 
11
(I) allow a branded company to share 
12
its monopoly profits with the generic com-
13
pany as a way to protect the branded com-
14
pany’s monopoly; and 
15
(II) have unduly delayed the mar-
16
keting of low-cost generic drugs contrary 
17
to free competition, the interests of con-
18
sumers, and the principles underlying anti-
19
trust law. 
20
(iii) Because of the price disparity between 
21
brand name and generic drugs, such agree-
22
ments are more profitable for both the brand 
23
and generic manufacturers than competition 
24
20:49 Nov 03, 2021
H5237
242 
•HR 5237 IH
and will become increasingly common unless 
1
prohibited. 
2
(iv) These agreements result in consumers 
3
losing the benefits that the 1984 Act was in-
4
tended to provide. 
5
(G) In 2010, the Biologics Price Competi-
6
tion and Innovation Act (Public Law 111–148) 
7
(referred to in this Act as the ‘‘BPCIA’’), was 
8
enacted with the intent of facilitating the early 
9
entry of biosimilar and interchangeable follow- 
10
on versions of branded biological products while 
11
preserving incentives for innovation. 
12
(H) Biological drugs play an important 
13
role in treating many serious illnesses, from 
14
cancers to genetic disorders. They are also ex-
15
pensive, representing more than 40 percent of 
16
all prescription drug spending. 
17
(I) Competition from biosimilar and inter-
18
changeable biological products promises to 
19
lower drug costs and increase patient access to 
20
biological medicines. But ‘‘reverse payment’’ 
21
settlement agreements also threaten to delay 
22
the entry of biosimilar and interchangeable bio-
23
logical products, which would undermine the 
24
goals of BPCIA. 
25

(2) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this Act 
1
are— 
2
(A) to enhance competition in the pharma-
3
ceutical market by stopping anticompetitive 
4
agreements between brand name and generic 
5
drug and biosimilar biological product manufac-
6
turers that limit, delay, or otherwise prevent 
7
competition from generic drugs and biosimilar 
8
biological products; and 
9
(B) to support the purpose and intent of 
10
antitrust law by prohibiting anticompetitive 
11
practices in the pharmaceutical industry that 
12
harm consumers.
