Expressing support for recognizing the ‘‘Police Unity Tour’’. 
Whereas Federal, State, local, and Tribal police officers, 
sheriffs, and other law enforcement officers across the 
United States serve with valor, dignity, and integrity;

Florham Park Police Department organized the ‘‘Police 
Unity Tour’’ from Florham Park, New Jersey, to the Na-
tional Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in the Dis-
trict of Columbia, with the hope of bringing public aware-
ness of police officers who have died in the line of duty 
and to honor their sacrifices; 
Whereas today, the ‘‘Police Unity Tour’’ has over 1,900 
members nationwide who make the trip;

Whereas, as of May 2020, the ‘‘Police Unity Tour’’ has do-
nated over 30,000,000 dollars for the National Law En-

Chapter 37, was started by Port Authority (PA) police 
officers in 2002 and named in honor of the 37 PA offi-
cers who were killed in the line of duty on September 11, 
2001, at the World Trade Center; and 
Whereas the original members of Chapter 37 pledged to al-
ways start their ‘‘Police Unity Tour’’ at the World Trade 
Center to honor, respect, and remember the officers who 
lost their lives on September 11, 2001, and ‘‘We will 
never forget.’’: Now, therefore, be it
