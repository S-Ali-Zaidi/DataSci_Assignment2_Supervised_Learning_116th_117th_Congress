SEC. 4. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress makes the following findings: 
2
(1) The majority of recent emerging infectious 
3
diseases have originated in wildlife. 
4
(2) There is a rise in the frequency of zoonotic 
5
spillover events and outbreaks of such diseases. 
6
(3) This rise in such spillover events and out-
7
breaks relates to the increased interaction between 
8
humans and wildlife. 
9
(4) There is a progressive and increasing rise in 
10
interaction between human populations and wildlife 
11
related to deforestation, habitat degradation, and ex-
12
pansion of human activity into the habitat of such 
13
wildlife. 
14
(5) The increase in such interactions due to 
15
these factors, particularly in forested regions of trop-
16
ical countries where there is high mammalian diver-
17
sity, is a serious risk factor for spillover events. 
18
(6) A serious risk factor for spillover events 
19
also relates to the collection, production, commercial 
20
trade, and sale for human consumption of wildlife 
21
that may transmit to zoonotic pathogens to humans 
22
that may then replicate and be transmitted within 
23
the human population. 
24
(7) Such a risk factor is increased if it involves 
25
wildlife that—

(A) does not ordinarily interact with hu-
1
mans; or 
2
(B) lives under a stressful condition, as 
3
such condition exacerbates the shedding of 
4
zoonotic pathogens. 
5
(8) Markets for such wildlife to be sold for 
6
human consumption are found in many countries. 
7
(9) In some communities, such wildlife may be 
8
the only accessible source of high quality nutrition. 
9
(10) The public health emergency has resulted 
10
in— 
11
(A) trillions of dollars in economic damage 
12
to the United States; and 
13
(B) the deaths of hundreds of thousands of 
14
American citizens.
