part 
of 
some 
Russian 
disinformation campaign, and I think it’s clear that the 
American people know that’’;

Whereas Twitter locked the New York Post’s account for 
seven days following the October 2020 report; 
Whereas, on April 8, 2021, the Daily Mail reported that 
‘‘103,000 text messages, 154,000 emails, more than 
2,000 photos and dozens of videos’’ from Hunter Biden’s 
laptop were authenticated by forensic experts; 
Whereas, on March 17, 2022, the New York Times published 
an article tacitly referring to these same legitimate emails 
found on Hunter Biden’s laptop, which are being used in 
a grand jury probe into his finances; 
Whereas, on March 22, 2022, 4 of the 51 signatories have 
issued sustained support of their letter, since the New 
York Times March 17th article, which passively verified 
the data discovered on Hunter Biden’s ‘‘Russian 
Disinformation’’ laptop; and 
Whereas this resolution shall be known as the ‘‘Spook Who 
Cried Wolf Resolution’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-
1
resentatives that the 51 signatories of the letter who pub-
2
licly and falsely decried Hunter Biden’s laptop to be Rus-
3
sian disinformation should be barred from holding any 
4
level of security clearances indefinitely.
