eran population, to be located at the corner of Hoo-
1
per and Caudina Avenues, and expected to be com-
2
pleted and functioning in 2023. 
3
(2) The Mayor and the Township Council be-
4
lieve that this facility deserves to be named in honor 
5
of Second Lieutenant Leonard G. ‘‘Bud’’ Lomell, 
6
Jr., a long time Toms River and Ocean County resi-
7
dent, who served courageously and heroically during 
8
World War II. 
9
(3) Second Lieutenant Lomell was born in 
10
1920, the adopted son of Scandinavian immigrant 
11
parents living in Brooklyn, New York, and his fam-
12
ily eventually moved to Point Pleasant Beach, New 
13
Jersey. 
14
(4) Second Lieutenant Lomell attended Ten-
15
nessee Wesleyan College, and following college, he 
16
enlisted in the Army, volunteering for the elite 
17
Ranger Corps, and was a member of the Second 
18
Rangers Battalion during the June 6, 1944, D-Day 
19

(5) Then-First Sergeant Lomell’s Platoon land-

geted Omaha and Utah beaches, successfully scaling 
1
the cliffs, despite a withering German defensive bar-
2
rage. 
3
(6) Pointe-du-Hoc was heavily defended by the 
4
Germans, and the mission of the 225 Rangers was 
5
to disable five 155 millimeter artillery guns, which 
6
could have rained artillery fire on the Americans 
7
landing on either beach, jeopardizing the invasion. 
8
(7) Unknown to the Americans, the guns had 
9
been moved from the tip of the Pointe and hidden, 
10
pointed in the direction of Utah Beach, in an inland 
11
apple orchard nearly a mile from the coastal bat-
12
teries. 
13
(8) First Sergeant Lomell and another Ranger, 
14
Sergeant Jack Kuhn, found the guns undefended, 
15
and with Kuhn providing cover, Lomell destroyed 
16
the weapons with thermite grenades and using his 
17
rifle butt to smash the sights, saving countless Allied 
18
lives. 
19
(9) First Sergeant Lomell subsequently received 
20
a battlefield promotion to Second Lieutenant, and 
21
was awarded some of the military’s highest honors, 
22
including the Distinguished Service Cross, Purple 
23
Heart, and Silver Star.
