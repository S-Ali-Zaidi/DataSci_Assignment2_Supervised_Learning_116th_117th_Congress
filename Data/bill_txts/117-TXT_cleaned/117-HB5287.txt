SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The public-private partnership, Operation 
3
Warp Speed, sought to develop, manufacture, and 
4
ship 300,000,000 doses of COVID–19 vaccines 
5
around the United States. 
6
(2) This effort would not have been possible 
7
without researchers, scientists, doctors, epidemiolo-
8
gists, and others around the world who have worked 
9
tirelessly and collaboratively to develop lifesaving 
10
vaccines to combat the coronavirus by reducing the 
11
likelihood of transmission, building immune resil-
12
iency, avoiding hospitalizations, and reducing the 
13
likelihood of death. 
14
(3) Through the academic, research, and ana-
15
lytic expertise of universities and their faculty, re-
16
searchers, and students, their efforts contributed to 
17
providing valuable information to the public on the 
18
severity of the coronavirus worldwide and, in some 
19
cases, contributed to vaccine development. 
20
(4) Several of the resulting vaccines represent 
21
historic breakthroughs in biopharmaceutical tech-
22
nology, which are predicated on years of leading re-
23
search conducted in laboratories and hospitals that 
24
benefit from the significant financial investment of 
25
United States taxpayers through the Department of

Health and Human Services, the National Institutes 
1
of Health, including the National Institute of Allergy 
2
and Infectious Diseases, and the Biomedical Ad-
3
vanced Research and Development Authority. 
4
(5) As a response to COVID–19, Congress pro-
5
vided $47,600,000,000 for the effort to support the 
6
private sector’s research and development into effec-
7
tive technologies, the scale-up of manufacturing ca-
8
pacity for promising vaccine candidates, and the dis-
9
tribution of vaccines that received emergency use au-
10
thorization by the Food and Drug Administration. 
11
(6) These professionals worked under record 
12
timelines to develop safe, effective vaccines dem-
13
onstrated in trials and granted emergency use au-
14
thorization by the Food and Drug Administration. It 
15
shattered the typical timeline for vaccine develop-
16
ment and production from over a decade to less than 
17
12 months. 
18
(7) The first vaccine trial volunteers who lined 
19
up to have shots administered in their arms paved 
20
the way for emergency use authorization by the 
21
Food and Drug Administration and the hundreds of 
22
millions of people of the United States that have 
23
since been vaccinated.

(8) These remarkable achievements in medical 
1
science will have positive implications for future vac-
2
cine development, helping to combat new viruses, 
3
leading to improvements in health and well-being. 
4
(9) The tremendous efforts in vaccine develop-
5
ment can be celebrated and attributed to building di-
6
verse teams, including the notable efforts of many 
7
individuals across the planet. 
8
(10) Vaccines authorized for emergency use in 
9
the United States benefitted greatly from global co-
10
operation, strategic partnerships, and collaboration 
11
with publicly funded agencies and research capabili-
12
ties of the academic community. 
13
(11) As a result of the collaborative efforts, 
14
people around the world are benefitting from the ad-
15
ministration of vaccines, although work remains to 
16
support governments around the world in ensuring 
17
vaccines are equitably distributed. 
18
(12) The United States, including through co-
19
operation with bilateral and multilateral partner-
20
ships, can help scale up manufacturing and distribu-
21
tion to all corners of the globe. 
22
(13) Operation Warp Speed successfully laid 
23
the groundwork for reopening the United States 
24
economy, contributing to the safety of the people of
