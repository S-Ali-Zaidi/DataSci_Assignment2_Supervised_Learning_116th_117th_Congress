It is the sense of Congress that—

•HR 9177 IH
(1) organized retail crime, a crime involving 
1
groups of individuals specifically targeting retail 
2
stores, often by using violence or threats of violence 
3
to subdue employees and shoppers while robbing 
4
stores of their most valuable and easily diverted 
5
merchandise, has been a growing concern to retail-
6
ers, industry, and law enforcement; 
7
(2) retailers have seen a dramatic increase in 
8
occurrences of organized retail crime, costing retail-
9
ers 
approximately 
$720,000 
per 
every 
10
$1,000,000,000 in sales in 2019, representing more 
11
than a 50-percent increase in such losses since 2015. 
12
Further, according to the National Retail Federa-
13
tion, the use of violence or aggression is increasing 
14
in the commission of these crimes, with 2⁄3 of retail-
15
ers reporting an increase of violence during the com-
16
mission of retail theft; 
17
(3) organized retail crime— 
18
(A) threatens the safety and liberty of in-
19
dividuals in the United States when those indi-
20
viduals engage in commerce; 
21
(B) erodes the retail economy for cus-
22
tomers and businesses alike; and 
23
(C) finances transnational criminal organi-
24
zations that use the proceeds of those thefts to

•HR 9177 IH
support the criminal goals of the criminal orga-
1
nizations; and 
2
(4) it has become necessary for Congress— 
3
(A) to amend title 18, United States Code, 
4
to ensure that law enforcement has the legal 
5
tools necessary to combat organized retail crime 
6
in the same capacity as law enforcement is able 
7
to combat theft and diversion from other por-
8
tions of the supply chain; and 
9
(B) to direct the executive branch to create 
10
a central coordination center to align Federal, 
11
State, local, territorial, and Tribal efforts to 
12
combat organized retail crime.
