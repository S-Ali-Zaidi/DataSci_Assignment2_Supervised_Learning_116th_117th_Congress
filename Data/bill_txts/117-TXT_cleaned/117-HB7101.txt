SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. 
4
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that— 
5
(1) the Constitution of the United States pro-
6
hibits political or economic oligarchies, which are in-
7
compatible with a republican form of government; 
8
(2) the antitrust laws, including the Sherman 
9
Act (15 U.S.C. 1 et seq.), the Clayton Act (15 
10
U.S.C. 12 et seq.), and the Federal Trade Commis-
11
sion Act (15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.), were enacted to pro-
12
hibit political and economic oligarchies, to protect 
13
fair, open, and competitive markets, and to prevent 
14
corporations from abusing their power to stifle com-
15
petition and improperly influence democratic proc-
16
esses; 
17
(3) Federal courts have misinterpreted the anti-
18
trust laws to the detriment of consumers, workers, 
19
society, and the United States political economy, in-
20
cluding by enhancing the misguided and narrowly 
21
defined ‘‘consumer welfare standard,’’ as described 
22
by the Supreme of the United States in Reiter v. 
23
Sonotone Corp., 442 U.S. 330 (1979), and its prog-
24
eny;

•HR 7101 IH
(4) concentrated economic power creates con-
1
centrated political power, allowing giant corporations 
2
to invest growing sums of money into influencing 
3
government to tilt laws and rules in their favor; 
4
(5) over the last 4 decades, powerful corpora-
5
tions have unconstitutionally amassed too much in-
6
fluence over the United States economy, stifling 
7
competition in United States markets and harming 
8
workers, consumers, customer choice, sellers, small 
9
and minority-owned businesses (including farms and 
10
ranches), local, rural, and low-income communities, 
11
communities of color, privacy, quality, entrepreneur-
12
ship, and innovation; 
13
(6) in 1975, 109 companies pocketed half of all 
14
profits generated by firms in the United States 
15
whereas in 2015, the top 30 firms did so; 
16
(7) startup rates fell by more than half over the 
17
last 4 decades in industries that saw an increase in 
18
concentration; 
19
(8) dominant corporations, which often under-
20
invest in their operations and infrastructure, expose 
21
consumers in the United States to the risks of con-
22
centrated and brittle supply chains, such as short-
23
ages of essential goods and increased prices; 
24
03:41 Mar 17, 2022
H7101

•HR 7101 IH
(9) market concentration in essential markets, 
1
including those for medical equipment, food, and re-
2
tail, can pose serious national-security risks during 
3
crisis events such as the COVID–19 pandemic; 
4
(10) market concentration is associated with 
5
lower wages, and evidence shows that in more con-
6
centrated markets, giant corporations are less likely 
7
to pass on productivity gains to workers in the form 
8
of higher wages and more likely to engage in 
9
antiworker labor practices, which disproportionately 
10
harm female workers and workers of color; 
11
(11) corporate consolidation has especially 
12
harmed rural communities, low-income communities, 
13
and communities of color, as demonstrated by the 
14
impact of the recent Sprint and T-Mobile merger on 
15
low-income customers who purchase prepaid plans; 
16
(12) Federal agencies other than the Federal 
17
Trade Commission and the Department of Justice 
18
may have particular expertise with respect to the 
19
competitive effects of an acquisition and should play 
20
a stronger role in antitrust enforcement; 
21
(13) State attorneys general may have critical 
22
local knowledge or regional concerns about the com-
23
petitive effects of an acquisition and should play a 
24
stronger role in antitrust enforcement;

(14) section 7A of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 
1
18a) (referred to in this section as ‘‘section 7A’’) 
2
was enacted to allow the antitrust agencies to review 
3
acquisitions before consummation; 
4
(15) the recent explosion of filings under sec-
5
tion 7A has overwhelmed the Federal Trade Com-
6
mission and the Department of Justice, a phe-
7
nomenon exacerbated by strict statutory deadlines 
8
for the review process and an onerous judicial proc-
9
ess to obtain injunctions to block acquisitions likely 
10
to lessen competition; 
11
(16) the antitrust agencies should be empow-
12
ered to reject acquisitions that they review under 
13
section 7A, and those decisions should be treated as 
14
reviewable agency actions; 
15
(17) the use of structural and behavioral rem-
16
edies to protect competition and prevent monopo-
17
listic behavior has proven ineffective across various 
18
industries; 
19
(18) the Federal Trade Commission and the 
20
Department of Justice have the authority under ex-
21
isting law to conduct retrospective reviews of any 
22
consummated acquisition at any time, regardless of 
23
whether the acquisition was nonreportable or the 
24

6 
•HR 7101 IH
government opposed the acquisition before its con-
1
summation; 
2
(19) because some data about the competitive 
3
effects of an acquisition will necessarily emerge after 
4
consummation, it is critical that the Federal Trade 
5
Commission and the Department of Justice conduct 
6
retrospective reviews of acquisitions in order to rem-
7
edy anticompetitive acquisitions, including through 
8
unwinding; 
9
(20) an acquisition may have competitive effects 
10
in markets beyond the lines of commerce of the 
11
transaction, particularly when a party has an exten-
12
sive business ecosystem; and 
13
(21) excessive market concentration must be 
14
remedied to restore and protect competition in the 
15
United States and ensure the United States econ-
16
omy and democracy benefit workers, consumers, cus-
17
tomer choice, sellers, small and minority-owned busi-
18
nesses (including farms and ranches), local, rural, 
19
and low-income communities, communities of color, 
20
privacy, quality, entrepreneurship, and innovation. 
21
(b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this Act are to— 
22
(1) ban the most anticompetitive acquisitions; 
23
(2) restore and protect the competitive process; 
24

litigation placed on Federal and State officials;
