RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
Congress disapproves of the Occupational Safety and 
Health Administration’s Vaccine Mandate. 
Whereas the Occupational Safety and Health Administration 
issued an emergency temporary standard (ETS) to re-
quire employers with more than 100 employees to ensure 
that all their workers are either fully vaccinated against 
COVID–19 or subject them to weekly testing and mask- 
wearing; 
Whereas non-complying businesses could be fined, and non- 
complying employees fired;

•HRES 779 IH 
Whereas Congress tasked the Department of Health and 
Human Services with determining the safety, efficacy, 
and appropriate use of vaccines; 
Whereas Congress authorized the Food and Drug Adminis-
tration to determine whether vaccines should be allowed 
in interstate commerce; 
Whereas Congress empowered the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention to recommend who should receive 
such vaccines; 
Whereas Congress authorized the Occupational Safety and 
Health Administration to set and enforce standards af-
fecting the working conditions for workers resulting from 
workplace specific risks; 
Whereas the Occupational Safety and Health Administra-
tion’s use of the emergency temporary standard is an 
abuse of executive authority because COVID–19 is not a 
workplace specific risk; and 
Whereas other agencies have already been given broad au-
thority by Congress on COVID–19 vaccines and miti-
gating the public health effects of COVID–19: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives stands 
1
in opposition to any adverse punishment for private em-
2
ployers and private employees who choose not to receive 
3
the COVID–19 vaccine.
