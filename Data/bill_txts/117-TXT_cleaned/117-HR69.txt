RESOLUTION 
Expressing the need for the Federal Government to establish 
a national biodiversity strategy for protecting biodiversity 
for current and future generations. 
Whereas the planet is facing an unprecedented biodiversity 
crisis, largely driven by human activity; 
Whereas recent scientific studies have confirmed human-driv-
en activities are significantly damaging the Earth’s eco-
systems by— 
(1) altering 75 percent of the area of terrestrial en-
vironments and 66 percent of marine environments; 
(2) directly exploiting wildlife and plant species; 
(3) accelerating climate change, directly harming na-
ture and exacerbating other threats; 
(4) polluting air, land, and water; and

(5) introducing invasive species; 
Whereas these studies have shown that human-driven threats 
have harmed biodiversity by— 
(1) threatening approximately one million species 
with extinction now and in the coming decades, includ-
ing— 
(A) over 40 percent of amphibians; 
(B) 33 percent of corals, sharks, shark rel-
atives, and marine mammals; 
(C) over 60 percent of cycads and over 30 per-
cent of conifer trees; and 
(D) about 10 percent of over 5 million insect 
species; and 
(2) causing population sizes of wild species to de-
cline by— 
(A) an average of 68 percent for mammals, 
birds, fish, amphibians, and reptiles; 
(B) nearly 3 billion birds in North America 
since 1970; 
(C) about 50 percent for live corals; and 
(D) an average of over 20 percent overall; 
Whereas human activity is accelerating the decline of impor-
tant economic and cultural services, with— 
(1) the productivity of nearly one-fourth of the land 
surface reduced; 
(2) over one-third of land surface and 75 percent of 
freshwater resources devoted to crop or livestock produc-
tion; 
(3) about half a trillion dollars of global crops at 
risk from pollinator loss;

(4) one-third of marine fisheries overfished, 60 per-
cent fished at capacity, and just 7 percent fished below 
capacity; and 
(5) 25 percent of greenhouse gas emissions caused 
by land clearing, crops, and fertilization; 
Whereas the decline of biodiversity disproportionately impacts 
indigenous and other communities that rely on nature for 
essential services, including Native Americans and Alaska 
Natives who offer unique perspectives and traditional eco-
logical knowledge critical to preserving biodiversity; 
Whereas the decline of biodiversity and ecosystem services ob-
served worldwide is occurring in the United States; 
Whereas the United States possesses an abundance and great 
diversity of species of fish, wildlife, and plants that are 
of significant value to the United States for intrinsic, 
aesthetic, ecological, educational, cultural, recreational, 
economic, and scientific reasons; 
Whereas the decline of biodiversity presents a direct threat 
to the security, health, and well-being of the people of the 
United States by causing economic harm through the loss 
of valuable ecosystem services such as zoonotic disease 
buffering, pollination, water filtration, soil replenishment, 
the provision of game species, medicinal products, rec-
reational opportunities, and others; 
Whereas communities of color, low-income communities, Trib-
al communities, and other populations that have been 
systematically and deliberately targeted for siting envi-
ronmentally degrading activities, and excluded from con-
servation efforts, face disproportionate impacts from bio-
diversity loss;

Whereas Federal agencies are tasked with protecting and 
conserving biodiversity in the United States and world-
wide through a variety of legal and policy channels; 
Whereas there is no coordinating policy to maximize the ef-
fectiveness of the Federal Government’s conservation ef-
forts and collaboration with the States, local govern-
ments, Tribes, private landowners, and other nongovern-
mental stakeholders; 
Whereas the United States should play a leading role on the 
international stage in addressing the biodiversity crisis, 
yet the United States— 
(1) is not a party to the Convention on Biological 
Diversity, the Convention on Migratory Species, and 
other relevant international agreements; 
(2) does not issue a national biodiversity outlook, 
contrary to most other countries; and 
(3) does not have a national biodiversity strategy as 
part of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on 
Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services; and 
Whereas scientific research highlights essential pathways for-
ward, including— 
(1) establishing the effective conservation, restora-
tion, and durable protection of at least 30 percent of an 
ecologically representative area of the Nation’s and the 
world’s lands, freshwaters, and oceans by 2030 by work-
ing collaboratively with governments, land owners, fish-
ers, indigenous peoples, communities, and others; 
(2) restoring or rewilding species, degraded habitats, 
and ensuring integrity and connectivity of protected 
areas; 
(3) retaining and protecting highly intact eco-
systems;

needed for sustainable, ecologically, and safe food produc-
tion; and 
(5) addressing the threats posed by invasive species:
