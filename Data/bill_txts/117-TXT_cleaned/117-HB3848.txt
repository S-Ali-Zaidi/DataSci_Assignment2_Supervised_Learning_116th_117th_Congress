A BILL 
To establish the National Commission on Critical Supply 
Chains, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Critical Supply Chains

Commission Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
6
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Many Americans were shocked to find that 
8
the United States was unable to find or produce 
9
enough face masks, ventilators, hand sanitizer, test-
10

ing kits, hospital beds, sedatives, and other medical 
1
necessities in response to the COVID–19 crisis due 
2
to limitations in the manufacturing supply chain and 
3
our dependence on foreign suppliers. 
4
(2) Shortages of medical supplies and equip-
5
ment are just one example of the risks we face due 
6
to the United States’ reliance on other countries for 
7
making many of our critical products. The United 
8
States also relies on other countries for— 
9
(A) technologies involved with renewable 
10
energies and car battery manufacturing; 
11
(B) rare earth materials that are essential 
12
to many high-technology products, including cell 
13
phones, satellites, and computers; 
14
(C) fabricating the most precise integrated 
15
circuits and microchips that are needed for 
16
complex electronics used in weapon systems, 
17
space systems, automobiles, and a variety of 
18
consumer products; 
19
(D) production of advanced machine tools 
20
and production equipment that U.S. factories 
21
need to manufacture their products; 
22
(E) delivery of precision scientific equip-
23
ment needed to produce breakthroughs in nano-
24

•HR 3848 IH
technology, medicine, and future batteries for 
1
electric vehicles; 
2
(F) manufacturing of clothing and other 
3
textiles; 
4
(G) production and distribution of food 
5
and agricultural goods; and 
6
(H) other critical products where substan-
7
tial harm would come to U.S. economic secu-
8
rity, national defense, or way of life if the sup-
9
ply chains were compromised or no longer avail-
10
able. 
11
(3) The American supply chain is the founda-
12
tion of our Nation’s economic competitiveness and is 
13
the delivery system that moves products to con-
14
sumers in every State across the Nation. 
15
(4) While U.S. manufacturers and domestic 
16
suppliers have substantial resources, some domestic 
17
capabilities and expertise have eroded due to reliance 
18
on the global supply chain. 
19
(5) Dependable and high-quality suppliers are 
20
crucial assets to any manufacturing company since 
21
manufacturers must get the right products to the 
22
right place at the right time to be most successful. 
23
(6) A secure and stable American supply chain 
24
is a necessary component of a prosperous manufac-
25

•HR 3848 IH
turing sector that contributes two trillion dollars an-
1
nually to the U.S. economy. 
2
(7) United States manufacturers are a major 
3
source of high quality employment in the U.S. at 
4
roughly 9 percent of the workforce. 
5
(8) United States manufacturers are a major 
6
driver of innovation, responsible for more than two- 
7
thirds of private sector research and development, 
8
receiving more than 90 percent of new patents. 
9
(9) United States manufacturers are essential 
10
to ensuring our national defense and homeland secu-
11
rity, as they provide the tools, equipment, systems, 
12
and protective gear for our military and first re-
13
sponders. 
14
(10) Manufacturers must consider supply chain 
15
risks and potential disruptions in their business deci-
16
sions, though many times supplier selection is driven 
17
by fixed production costs and other primary factors. 
18
(11) A more robust and resilient American sup-
19
ply chain is integral to the health and well-being of 
20
our economy and of businesses across every State, 
21
and improvements in the supply chain will drive af-
22
fordability, sustainability, and availability of prod-
23
ucts for our Nation.

(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
1
gress that— 
2
(1) a national commission on critical supply 
3
chains will benefit the United States in several im-
4
portant ways; 
5
(2) such a commission will provide expert 
6
knowledge, guidance, and recommendations to Con-
7
gress on the complex and strategically important 
8
issues related to bolstering American supply chains, 
9
which will help Congress find common ground to ad-
10
vance supply chain policies and approaches that ben-
11
efit our Nation both today and far into the future; 
12
(3) such a commission will provide rec-
13
ommendations to fix the shortcomings exposed in 
14
our existing national manufacturing strategy, so 
15
that we are prepared for the next crisis—whether it 
16
is due to a pandemic, a war, natural disaster, or 
17
something else—and that these strategic directions 
18
will catalyze a much-needed update to our national 
19
manufacturing strategy for revitalizing the U.S. 
20
manufacturing sector and increasing our economic 
21
growth; 
22
(4) such a commission will establish the basis 
23
for strengthening the security of, and adding resil-
24
iency to, an eroded American supply chain system, 
25
01:49 Jul 14, 2021

•HR 3848 IH
so that U.S. economic security, national defense, and 
1
way of life are not harmed when natural disasters or 
2
other events disrupt the supply of critical ingredi-
3
ents, components, or products from a specific source 
4
or region; 
5
(5) such a commission will trigger new domestic 
6
manufacturing jobs as a result of the growth and in-
7
creased robustness in the domestic supply chain and 
8
the manufacturing sector, and such domestic 
9
sourcing will also improve the security of intellectual 
10
property, reduce environmental impact and transpor-
11
tation costs due to fewer parts traveling overseas, 
12
and encourage economic clusters for supporting op-
13
erations to be located near manufacturing facilities; 
14
and 
15
(6) such a commission will improve the Nation’s 
16
national defense and homeland security by reducing 
17
vulnerabilities and risks due to excessive reliance on 
18
foreign sources of critical materials or components.
