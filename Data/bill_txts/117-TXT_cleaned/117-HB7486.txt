This Act may be cited as the ‘‘No Child Left Inside

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Hands-on experiences in nature help build 
8
stronger, smarter, and happier children. 
9
(2) Children and young adults are increasingly 
10
disconnected from the natural world around them,

spending less time outside playing, exploring, and 
1
learning. 
2
(3) Quality education for students includes reg-
3
ular opportunities to make connections outside of 
4
the classroom. 
5
(4) Environmental education, when integrated 
6
across the curriculum, has positive impacts on the 
7
development of important skills, such as critical 
8
thinking, problem solving, and citizenship and lead-
9
ership skills. 
10
(5) Every student should have the opportunity 
11
to participate in residential outdoor education pro-
12
grams or comparable outdoor education programs. 
13
(6) Outdoor and environmental education pro-
14
grams have been shown to build critical thinking 
15
skills and leadership skills, and can improve student 
16
attendance and retention rates. 
17
(7) Colleges, universities, and higher education 
18
associations play a critical role in cultivating the 
19
next generation of scientists, engineers, educators, 
20
planners, and business leaders for 21st century ca-
21
reers in the public and private sectors. 
22
(8) Environmental education, as part of the for-
23
mal prekindergarten through grade 12 school cur-
24
riculum, has positive impacts on student achieve-

ment in all subjects, and especially in science, read-
1
ing, mathematics, and social studies, and improves 
2
critical thinking skills, enthusiasm for learning, 
3
stewardship, and healthy lifestyles. 
4
(9) The Partnership for 21st Century Learning 
5
identified environmental literacy as one of the key 
6
interdisciplinary themes critical to helping students 
7
to acquire the skills, knowledge, and expertise nec-
8
essary to succeed in work and life. 
9
(10) The Programme for International Student 
10
Assessment (PISA) rankings find that the United 
11
States is falling behind other nations in preparing 
12
students with the educational tools necessary to 
13
compete for the growing opportunities in the 
14
sciences, including careers related to the environ-
15
ment, natural resources, and energy. 
16
(11) Forty-six States have developed, or are in 
17
the process of developing, environmental literacy 
18
plans to effectively integrate environmental edu-
19
cation into the prekindergarten through grade 12 
20
curriculum and to ensure that students graduate 
21
from high school environmentally literate. 
22
(12) Support from the Department of Edu-
23
cation is needed to help State and local educational 
24
agencies, and the partners of such agencies, imple-

curriculum frameworks for environmental and nat-
2
ural resource education that meets new State aca-
3
demic content and student achievement standards.

(13) Federal science agencies, natural resource 
5
agencies, and other agencies have important re-
6
sources, including Federal lands and laboratories, 
7
content experts, data, and programs, that can in-
8
form and support State and local environmental lit-
