RESOLUTION 
Supporting the goals and ideals of Dominican Heritage 
Month. 
Whereas the House of Representatives is proud to recognize 
and commemorate Dominican Heritage Month, an ob-
servance that celebrates the contributions of Dominican 
Americans; 
Whereas, in keeping with its time-honored traditions, we rec-
ognize and pay tribute to those who foster cultural pride 
and enhance the profile of diverse communities across the 
United States; 
Whereas Dominicans are freedom-loving people who first 
began their campaign for their independence in 1831 
under the leadership of Juan Pablo Duarte; 
Whereas, after the long and hard-fought campaign for free-
dom, a ceremonial musket shot fired on February 27,

1844, marked the Dominican Republic’s first official 
Independence Day; 
Whereas January 26 marks the beginning of the ‘‘Mes de la 
Patria’’ (Month of the Fatherland), a period in which the 
country celebrates the founding fathers and the symbols 
that identify Dominicans in the world; 
Whereas it would be befitting to celebrate Dominican heritage 
beginning on January 21, The Day of the Procession of 
Altagracia, the Dominican Republic’s most important re-
ligious celebration; 
Whereas it would also be befitting to end the period of Do-
minican heritage on February 27, the Dominican Repub-
lic’s Independence Day; 
Whereas Dominicans in the United States and abroad reserve 
the period between January 21 to February 27 to cele-
brate and honor Dominican heritage; 
Whereas celebrating Dominican Heritage Month gives the 
Nation the opportunity to acknowledge and applaud the 
economic, cultural, and social contributions Dominican 
Americans have made to the United States; 
Whereas the Dominican Studies Institute of the City Univer-
sity of New York is working on a National Register of 
Historic Places application for submission to the National 
Park Service that would create a noncontiguous cultural 
heritage district to document, acknowledge, and honor 
the contributions of the Dominican community; and 
Whereas approximately 2,400,000 people of Dominican origin 
currently reside in the United States, and over 2,000,000 
United States tourists visit the Dominican Republic an-
nually, accounting for the largest number of foreign tour-
