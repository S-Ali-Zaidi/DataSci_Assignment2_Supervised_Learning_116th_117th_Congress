1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Adversaries of the United States take ad-
3
vantage of a largely vulnerable academic system. 
4
Academia is a place of uniquely free thought; how-
5
ever, adversaries take advantage of access to feder-
6
ally funded sensitive research that takes place on the 
7
campuses of institutions of higher education. 
8
(2) As stated in a 2018 report by the White 
9
House Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy, 
10
‘‘More than 300,000 Chinese nationals annually at-
11
tend U.S. universities or find employment at U.S. 
12
national laboratories, innovation centers, incubators, 
13
and think tanks. Chinese nationals now account for 
14
approximately one third of foreign university and 
15
college students in the United States and about 25 
16
percent of graduate students specializing in science, 
17
technology, engineering, or math (STEM).’’. 
18
(3) International students from nations that are 
19
adversarial to the United States could face undue 
20
pressure or incentives to divulge technology to their 
21
home nation or to use sensitive information to nega-
22
tively impact the United States. According to the 
23
same 2018 White House Report, ‘‘The national and 
24
economic security risks are that the Chinese State 
25
may seek to manipulate or pressure even unwitting 
26

or unwilling Chinese nationals into becoming non- 
1
traditional information collectors that serve Beijing’s 
2
military and strategic ambitions.’’. 
3
(4) Technology and information that could be 
4
deemed sensitive to the national security interests of 
5
the United States should be given increased scrutiny 
6
to determine if access should be restricted in a re-
7
search environment. 
8
(5) An open federally funded research environ-
9
ment exposes the United States to the possibility of 
10
exchanging research affiliated with current or future 
11
critical military technological systems. 
12
(6) In Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) 
13
Director Wray’s view, Chinese non-traditional intel-
14
ligence collectors ‘‘are exploiting the very open re-
15
search and development environment that we have, 
16
which we all revere. But they’re taking advantage of 
17
it, so one of the things we’re trying to do is view the 
18
China threat as not just the whole-of-government 
19
threat, but a whole-of-society threat on their end, 
20
and I think it’s going to take a whole-of-society re-
21
sponse by us.’’. 
22
(7) As stated in the January 2018 China’s 
23
Technology Transfer Strategy report by the Defense 
24
Innovation Unit, ‘‘Academia is an opportune envi-
25

ronment for learning about science and technology 
1
since the cultural values of U.S. educational institu-
2
tions reflect an open and free exchange of ideas. As 
3
a result, Chinese science and engineering students 
4
frequently master technologies that later become 
5
critical to key military systems, amounting over time 
6
to unintentional violations of U.S. export control 
7
laws.’’. 
8
(8) In 2020, Bill Evanina, the senior counter-
9
intelligence official in the Office of the Director of 
10
National Intelligence, stated ‘‘. . . our ideas, tech-
11
nology, research, innovation is incubated on those 
12
university campuses. That’s where the science and 
13
technology originates—and that’s why it’s the most 
14
prime place to steal.’’. 
15
(9) David Bowdich, Deputy Director of the 
16
Federal Bureau of Investigation, stated at the 
17
March 2020 Academic Security and Counter Exploi-
18
tation Annual Seminar that [China] is ‘‘taking ad-
19
vantage of non-traditional collectors to work on their 
20
behalf, like ostensibly private companies or some 
21
graduate students and researchers. . . . And they 
22
are targeting cutting-edge research at our univer-
23
sities.’’.

(10) The 2020 House of Representatives China 
1
Task Force Report states, ‘‘Research programs at 
2
U.S. colleges and universities are increasingly tar-
3
geted by students and researchers acting as ‘non- 
4
traditional collectors’. These students, ranging from 
5
undergraduates to postdoctoral researchers, are gen-
6
erally untrained in espionage techniques but are 
7
asked to actively target sensitive dual-use tech-
8
nologies and other emerging research during their 
9
time in the U.S. The stated goal for these operations 
10
is to exfiltrate research data from the U.S. to the 
11
PRC.’’.
