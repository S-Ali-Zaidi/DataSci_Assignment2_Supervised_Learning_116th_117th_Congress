TITLE IV—JUSTICE FOR VICTIMS 
6
OF LYNCHING

SEC. 401. SHORT TITLE. 
8
This title may be cited as the ‘‘Justice for Victims 
9
of Lynching Act of 2021’’. 
10
SEC. 402. FINDINGS. 
11
Congress finds the following: 
12
(1) The crime of lynching succeeded slavery as 
13
the ultimate expression of racism in the United 
14
States following Reconstruction. 
15
(2) Lynching was a widely acknowledged prac-
16
tice in the United States until the middle of the 
17
20th century. 
18
(3) Lynching was a crime that occurred 
19
throughout the United States, with documented inci-
20
dents in all but 4 States. 
21
(4) At least 4,742 people, predominantly Afri-
22
can Americans, were reported lynched in the United 
23
States between 1882 and 1968. 
24
18:14 Feb 24, 2021
H677
45 
•HR 677 IH
(5) Ninety-nine percent of all perpetrators of 
1
lynching escaped from punishment by State or local 
2
officials. 
3
(6) Lynching prompted African Americans to 
4
form the National Association for the Advancement 
5
of Colored People (referred to in this section as the 
6
‘‘NAACP’’) and prompted members of B’nai B’rith 
7
to found the Anti-Defamation League. 
8
(7) Mr. Walter White, as a member of the 
9
NAACP and later as the executive secretary of the 
10
NAACP from 1931 to 1955, meticulously inves-
11
tigated lynchings in the United States and worked 
12
tirelessly to end segregation and racialized terror. 
13
(8) Nearly 200 anti-lynching bills were intro-
14
duced in Congress during the first half of the 20th 
15
century. 
16
(9) Between 1890 and 1952, 7 Presidents peti-
17
tioned Congress to end lynching. 
18
(10) Between 1920 and 1940, the House of 
19
Representatives passed 3 strong anti-lynching meas-
20
ures. 
21
(11) Protection against lynching was the min-
22
imum and most basic of Federal responsibilities, and 
23
the Senate considered but failed to enact anti-lynch-
24
ing legislation despite repeated requests by civil 
25
18:14 Feb 24, 2021
H677
46 
•HR 677 IH
rights groups, Presidents, and the House of Rep-
1
resentatives to do so. 
2
(12) The publication of ‘‘Without Sanctuary: 
3
Lynching Photography in America’’ helped bring 
4
greater awareness and proper recognition of the vic-
5
tims of lynching. 
6
(13) Only by coming to terms with history can 
7
the United States effectively champion human rights 
8
abroad. 
9
(14) An apology offered in the spirit of true re-
10
pentance moves the United States toward reconcili-
11
ation and may become central to a new under-
12
standing, on which improved racial relations can be 
13
forged. 
14
(15) Having concluded that a reckoning with 
15
our own history is the only way the country can ef-
16
fectively champion human rights abroad, 90 Mem-
17
bers of the United States Senate agreed to Senate 
18
Resolution 39, 109th Congress, on June 13, 2005, 
19
to apologize to the victims of lynching and the de-
20
scendants of those victims for the failure of the Sen-
21
ate to enact anti-lynching legislation. 
22
(16) The National Memorial for Peace and Jus-
23
tice, which opened to the public in Montgomery, Ala-
24
bama, on April 26, 2018, is the Nation’s first memo-
25
18:14 Feb 24, 2021

•HR 677 IH
rial dedicated to the legacy of enslaved Black people, 
1
people terrorized by lynching, African Americans hu-
2
miliated by racial segregation and Jim Crow, and 
3
people of color burdened with contemporary pre-
4
sumptions of guilt and police violence. 
5
(17) Notwithstanding the Senate’s apology and 
6
the heightened awareness and education about the 
7
Nation’s legacy with lynching, it is wholly necessary 
8
and appropriate for the Congress to enact legisla-
9
tion, after 100 years of unsuccessful legislative ef-
10
forts, finally to make lynching a Federal crime. 
11
(18) Further, it is the sense of Congress that 
12
criminal action by a group increases the likelihood 
13
that the criminal object of that group will be suc-
14
cessfully attained and decreases the probability that 
15
the individuals involved will depart from their path 
16
of criminality. Therefore, it is appropriate to specify 
17
criminal penalties for the crime of lynching, or any 
18
attempt or conspiracy to commit lynching. 
19
(19) The United States Senate agreed to unani-
20
mously Senate Resolution 118, 115th Congress, on 
21
April 5, 2017, ‘‘[c]ondemning hate crime and any 
22
other form of racism, religious or ethnic bias, dis-
23
crimination, incitement to violence, or animus tar-
24

notice specifically of Federal Bureau of Investigation 
1
statistics demonstrating that ‘‘among single-bias 
2
hate crime incidents in the United States, 59.2 per-
3
cent of victims were targeted due to racial, ethnic, 
4
or ancestral bias, and among those victims, 52.2 
5
percent were victims of crimes motivated by the of-
6
fenders’ anti-Black or anti-African American bias’’. 
7
(20) On September 14, 2017, President Donald 
8
J. Trump signed into law Senate Joint Resolution 
9
49 (Public Law 115–58; 131 Stat. 1149), wherein 
10
Congress ‘‘condemn[ed] the racist violence and do-
11
mestic terrorist attack that took place between Au-
12
gust 11 and August 12, 2017, in Charlottesville, 
13
Virginia’’ and ‘‘urg[ed] the President and his admin-
14
istration to speak out against hate groups that 
15
espouse racism, extremism, xenophobia, anti-Semi-
16
tism, and White supremacy; and use all resources 
17
available to the President and the President’s Cabi-
18
net to address the growing prevalence of those hate 
19
groups in the United States’’. 
20
(21) Senate Joint Resolution 49 (Public Law 
21
115–58; 131 Stat. 1149) specifically took notice of 
22
‘‘hundreds of torch-bearing White nationalists, 
23

24

gans and violently engaged with counter-demonstra-
1
tors on and around the grounds of the University of

3
‘‘reportedly are organizing similar events in other 
4
cities in the United States and communities every-
5
where are concerned about the growing and open 
6
display of hate and violence being perpetrated by 
7
those groups’’. 
8
(22) Lynching was a pernicious and pervasive 
9
tool that was used to interfere with multiple aspects 
10
of life—including the exercise of Federally protected 
11
rights, as enumerated in section 245 of title 18, 
12
United States Code, housing rights, as enumerated 
13
in section 901 of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 (42 
14
U.S.C. 3631), and the free exercise of religion, as 
15
enumerated in section 247 of title 18, United States 
16
Code. Interference with these rights was often effec-
17
tuated by multiple offenders and groups, rather than 
18
isolated individuals. Therefore, prohibiting conspir-
19
acies to violate each of these rights recognizes the 
20
history of lynching in the United States and serves 
21
to prohibit its use in the future.
