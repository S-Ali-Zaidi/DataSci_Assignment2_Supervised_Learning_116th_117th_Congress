medically underserved areas to offer obstetrical, surgical, 
trauma stabilization, and pain management services; 
Whereas CRNAs practice in every setting in which anesthesia 
is delivered, including traditional hospital surgical suites 
and obstetrical delivery rooms, the offices of dentists, po-
diatrists, ophthalmologists, and plastic surgeons, ambula-
tory surgical centers, and United States Military and 
Public Health Services and Department of Veterans Af-
fairs medical facilities; 
Whereas CRNAs are serving on the frontlines of the ongoing 
coronavirus pandemic, using their advanced skills in air-
way management, intubation, and ventilator management 
to help the sickest COVID–19 patients, leaving the com-
fort of their homes and families to travel to hospitals and 
facilities across the country so they can assist where the 
need is greatest; and 
Whereas the purpose of National CRNA Week, held January 
23, 2022, through January 29, 2022, is to raise public 
awareness of and celebrate the Nation’s 59,000 Certified 
Registered Nurse Anesthetists and student registered 
nurse anesthetists: Now, therefore, be it
