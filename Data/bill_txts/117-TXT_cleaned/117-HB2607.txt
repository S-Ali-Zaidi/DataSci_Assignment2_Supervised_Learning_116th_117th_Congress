14
ing, where possible, through the use of wearable and

(1) ALL TRAINEES.—The training under sub-
1
section (a) shall include the following explanations 
2
with respect to claims relating to toxic exposure: 
3
(A) A lack of a presumption of service con-
4
nection is not by itself sufficient to determine 
5
that service connection does not exist. 
6
(B) The claims adjudicator shall always 
7
consider whether direct service connection is ap-
8
plicable and request, as needed, an advisory 
9
medical opinion under section 5109 of title 38, 
10
United States Code. 
11
(C) While information included in the indi-
12
vidual longitudinal exposure record program of 
13
the Department of Veterans Affairs may be 
14
used to corroborate assertions of toxic exposure, 
15
a lack of such information, or a lack of other 
16
corroborating evidence of toxic exposure, is not 
17
by itself sufficient to determine that such expo-
18
sure did not occur or sufficient to deny the 
19
claim.
