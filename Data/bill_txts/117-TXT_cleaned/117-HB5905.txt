SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) African Americans played a pivotal role in 
3
the war effort during World War II, with more than 
4
1,200,000 African Americans serving in the Armed 
5
Forces, and, by 1945, approximately 1.9 percent of 
6
all officers in the Armed Forces were African Ameri-
7
cans. 
8
(2) Following World War II, the Servicemen’s 
9
Readjustment Act of 1944 (58 Stat. 284, commonly 
10
known as the ‘‘GI Bill’’) offered substantial material 
11
benefits to 16,000,000 veterans to assist them in re-
12
integrating into civil society. 
13
(3) The GI Bill offered a range of economic and 
14
educational benefits administered by the Federal 
15
Government through the Secretary of the Veterans 
16
Administration, including monetary assistance to ac-
17
cess higher education, government guarantees for 
18
housing loans, unemployment allowances, and civil-
19
ian workforce reentry assistance. 
20
(4) Though the legislative text of the GI Bill 
21
was race neutral, the administration of benefits 
22
through national, State, and local Veterans Adminis-
23
tration offices resulted in a pattern of discrimination 
24
against racial minorities, especially African Ameri-
25
cans.

(5) Veterans Administration benefits counselors 
1
denied African Americans access to educational ben-
2
efits at certain universities and funneled applicants 
3
into industrial and vocational schools rather than 
4
higher education opportunities, with just 6 percent 
5
of African American veterans of World War II earn-
6
ing a college degree, compared to 19 percent of 
7
White veterans of World War II. 
8
(6) In administering its housing guaranty pro-
9
gram, the Veterans Administration adopted the Fed-
10
eral Housing Administration’s racial exclusion pro-
11
grams, also known as redlining, which excluded a 
12
significant number of African Americans from tak-
13
ing full advantage of the housing guaranty program. 
14
(7) The GI Bill created substantial economic 
15
growth and wealth accumulation for those who could 
16
benefit, but discriminatory administration of the 
17
program prevented many African-American veterans 
18
of World War II from enjoying the full economic 
19
prosperity of the post-war period.
