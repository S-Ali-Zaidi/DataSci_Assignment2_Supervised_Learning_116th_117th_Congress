To amend the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to prohibit 
the use of Federal funds for the administration of an 
election for Federal office in States which permit ballot 
harvesting, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘No Federal Funds for 
4
Ballot Harvesting Act’’.

•HR 7958 IH
(1) the right to vote is a fundamental right of 
1
citizens of the United States, as described by the 
2
Constitution of the United States; 
3
(2) the Committee on House Administration of 
4
the House of Representatives, which is charged with 
5
investigating election irregularities, received reports 
6
through its official Election Observer Program for 
7
the 2018 general election and the 2020 general elec-
8
tion, as well as from other stakeholders, that individ-
9
uals other than voters themselves were depositing 
10
large amounts of absentee ballots at polling places 
11
throughout California and other States, a practice 
12
colloquially known as ‘‘ballot harvesting’’; 
13
(3) the practice of ballot harvesting creates sig-
14
nificant vulnerabilities in the chain of custody of bal-
15
lots because individuals collecting ballots are not re-
16
quired to be registered voters and are not required 
17
to identify themselves at a voter’s home, and the 
18
State does not track how many ballots are harvested 
19
in an election; 
20
(4) in North Carolina, a congressional election 
21
was invalidated due to fraud associated with ballot 
22
harvesting committed by a political operative, and it 
23
is unlikely such activity would have been detected

were it not for the prohibition against ballot har-
1
vesting in the State; 
2
(5) ballot harvesting invites electioneering activ-
3
ity at home and weakens States’ long-standing voter 
4
protection procedures, which remain in place at poll-
5
ing locations, creating the possibility of undue influ-
6
ence over voters by political operatives and other bad 
7
actors; and 
8
(6) the Supreme Court of the United States has 
9
affirmed State authority to restrict ballot harvesting 
10
(Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee, 141 
11
S. Ct. 2321 (2021)).
