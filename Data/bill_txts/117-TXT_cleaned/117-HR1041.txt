RESOLUTION 
Supporting the designation of July 20, 2022, as 
‘‘Glioblastoma Awareness Day’’. 
Whereas approximately 13,460 new cases of glioblastoma will 
be diagnosed in the United States in 2022; 
Whereas glioblastoma is— 
(1) the most common malignant brain tumor, ac-
counting for approximately 1⁄2 of all primary malignant 
brain tumors; and 
(2) the most aggressive, complex, difficult to treat, 
and deadly type of brain tumor; 
Whereas it is estimated that more than 10,000 individuals in 
the United States will succumb to glioblastoma each year;

Whereas the 5-year survival rate for glioblastoma patients is 
only 6.8 percent, and the median length of survival for 
glioblastoma patients is only 8 months; 
Whereas glioblastoma is described as a disease that affects 
the ‘‘essence of self’’, as the treatment and removal of 
glioblastoma presents significant challenges due to the 
uniquely complex and fragile nature of the brain, the pri-
mary organ in the human body that controls not only 
cognitive ability, but also the actions of every organ and 
limb; 
Whereas patients and caregivers play a critical role in fur-
thering research for glioblastoma; 
Whereas, relative to other types of cancers, brain cancer pa-
tients pay the second highest out-of-pocket costs for med-
ical services in both the initial and end-of life phases of 
care; 
Whereas, although research advances may fuel the develop-
ment of new treatments for glioblastoma, challenging ob-
stacles to accelerating progress toward new treatments 
for glioblastoma remain, and there are no screening or 
early detection methods; 
Whereas, in 2021, the World Health Organization reclassified 
brain tumors and made significant changes to the molec-
ular characteristics of a glioblastoma diagnosis, necessi-
tating critical biomarker testing for patients suspected of 
having a possible glioblastoma; 
Whereas, although glioblastoma was first described in medical 
and scientific literature in the 1920s, and despite its dev-
astating prognosis, only 4 drugs and 1 medical device 
have been approved by the Food and Drug Administra-
tion to treat glioblastoma since the 1920s, and the mor-

tality rates associated with glioblastoma have changed lit-
tle during the past 30 years; 
Whereas, in 2020, the National Cancer Institute established 
the Glioblastoma Therapeutics Network (referred to in 
this preamble as ‘‘GTN’’), as part of a national infra-
structure to enhance and support the discovery and devel-
opment of glioblastoma therapies available for multi-insti-
tutional GTN teams to drive therapeutic agents through 
pre-clinical studies and early-phase clinical trials, which 
are necessary to rapidly evaluate potential treatments to 
advance toward cures and improved quality of life; and 
Whereas there is a need for greater public awareness of glio-
blastoma, including awareness of both— 
(1) the urgent unmet medical needs of glioblastoma 
patients; and 
(2) the opportunities for research of, and treatment 
advances for, glioblastoma: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the designation of ‘‘Glioblastoma 
2
Awareness Day’’; 
3
(2) encourages increased public awareness of 
4
glioblastoma; 
5
(3) honors the individuals who have died from 
6
glioblastoma, a devastating disease, or are currently 
7
living with it; 
8
(4) supports efforts to develop better treat-
9
ments for glioblastoma that will improve the long- 
10
term prognosis for, and the quality of life of, individ-
11
uals diagnosed with the disease;

(5) recognizes the importance of molecular bio-

3
(6) expresses support for the individuals who
