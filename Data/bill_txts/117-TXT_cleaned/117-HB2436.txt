A BILL 
To amend title 38, United States Code, to concede exposure 
to airborne hazards and toxins from burn pits under 
certain circumstances, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Veterans Burn Pits 
4
Exposure Recognition Act of 2021’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
6
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following find-
7
ings: 
8
08:47 May 28, 2021
H2436
2 
•HR 2436 IH
(1) The health of some members of the Armed 
1
Forces and veterans who served in certain locations, 
2
often multiple times, may have been affected by 
3
their service near burn pits and other sources of air-
4
borne hazards. 
5
(2) Determining the location of burn pits, and 
6
the scope of health effects associated to exposure, re-
7
mains the subject of much investigation, research, 
8
and good faith efforts by the Department of Vet-
9
erans Affairs, the Department of Defense, other gov-
10
ernment agencies, and the National Academies of 
11
Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 
12
(3) The locations of burn pits used by the De-
13
partment of Defense and partnered armed forces, 
14
and the possible health effects associated by their 
15
use, may never be completely known, as— 
16
(A) some location and air and soil quality 
17
data is fragmentary; and 
18
(B) the research involved with establishing 
19
links between burn pit exposure and health con-
20
ditions by necessity is complex, years in length, 
21
and in the end, in some cases, inconclusive. 
22
(4) The September 2020 National Academies of 
23
Sciences, Engineering and Medicine consensus study 
24
report entitled ‘‘Respiratory Health Effects of Air-
25
08:47 May 28, 2021
H2436
3 
•HR 2436 IH
borne Hazards Exposures in the Southwest Asia 
1
Theater of Military Operations’’ concludes that the 
2
available evidence does not allow a definitive deter-
3
mination to be made about any potential association 
4
between airborne hazards in the theater and numer-
5
ous respiratory health outcomes. The report charac-
6
terizes existing research as inadequate, and advises 
7
that additional research be done, including longitu-
8
dinal studies that by design take years. 
9
(5) In the interim, though, some veterans have 
10
already been adversely affected by their exposure to 
11
burn pits, and their claims to certain benefits fur-
12
nished by the Department of Veterans Affairs can 
13
be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. 
14
(6) When filing a claim for certain benefits fur-
15
nished by the Department of Veterans Affairs, the 
16
application requires that each veteran show evidence 
17
of their exposure to burn pits, however if the evi-
18
dence of exposure to burn pits is not provided, the 
19
claim is often denied. 
20
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
21
gress that— 
22
(1) if it is determined that a veteran was de-
23
ployed to a covered location during a certain period, 
24
the Secretary of Veterans Affairs should concede 
25
08:47 May 28, 2021
H2436
4 
•HR 2436 IH
that the member or veteran was exposed to certain 
1
toxic substances, chemicals, and hazards; 
2
(2) a concession of exposure as described in 
3
paragraph (1) should not alone be sufficient to enti-
4
tle one to health care or disability compensation 
5
under laws administered by the Secretary of Vet-
6
erans Affairs; 
7
(3) the Department of Veterans Affairs, the 
8
Department of Defense, and other relevant agencies 
9
should make information regarding burn pit loca-
10
tions immediately available to the public, with appro-
11
priate caveats to its completeness and need for po-
12
tential future revision; and 
13
(4) the earliest possible period for which the 
14
Secretary of Veterans Affairs should make conces-
15
sions as described in paragraph (1) should begin on 
16
August 2, 1990.
