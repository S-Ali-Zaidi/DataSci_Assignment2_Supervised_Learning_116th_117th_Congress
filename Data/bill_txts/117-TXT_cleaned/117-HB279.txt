Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Roadless Area Con-
4
servation Act of 2021’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. 
6
(a) IN GENERAL.—Congress finds that— 
7
(1) there is a compelling need to establish na-
8
tional protection for inventoried roadless areas of the 
9
National Forest System in order to protect the 
10
unique social and ecological values of those irreplace-
11
able resources; 
12
(2) roadless areas protect healthy watersheds 
13
and the numerous benefits of healthy watersheds, 
14
which include— 
15
(A) providing the setting for many forms 
16
of outdoor recreation; 
17
(B) ensuring a supply of clean water for 
18
domestic, agricultural, and industrial uses; 
19
(C) providing drinking water to tens of 
20
millions of citizens of the United States; and 
21
(D) 
helping 
maintain 
abundant 
and 
22
healthy fish and wildlife populations and habi-
23
tats;

(3) maintaining roadless areas in a relatively 
1
undisturbed condition— 
2
(A) saves downstream communities mil-
3
lions of dollars in water filtration costs; and 
4
(B) is crucial to preserve the flow of af-
5
fordable, clean water to a growing population; 
6
(4) the protection of roadless areas can main-
7
tain biological strongholds and refuges for many im-
8
periled species by halting the ongoing fragmentation 
9
of the landscape into smaller and smaller parcels of 
10
land divided by road corridors; 
11
(5) roadless areas conserve native biodiversity 
12
by serving as a bulwark against the spread of non-
13
native invasive species; 
14
(6) roadless areas provide important backcoun-
15
try fish and game habitat, creating opportunities for 
16
hunting and commercial and sport fishing; 
17
(7) roadless areas provide unparalleled opportu-
18
nities for outdoor recreation, including hiking, camp-
19
ing, picnicking, wildlife viewing, hunting, fishing, 
20
cross-country skiing, canoeing, mountain biking, and 
21
similar activities; 
22
(8) while roadless areas may have many wilder-
23
ness-like attributes, unlike wilderness areas, the use 
24

•HR 279 IH
of mechanized means of travel is allowed in many 
1
roadless areas; 
2
(9) roadless areas contain many sites sacred to 
3
Native Americans, Alaska Natives, and other groups 
4
that use roadless areas for spiritual and religious 
5
practices and access, including customary and tradi-
6
tional uses and activities; 
7
(10) from the inception of Federal land man-
8
agement, the mission of the Forest Service has been 
9
to manage the National Forest System for multiple 
10
uses, including resource utilization, conservation, 
11
and other uses; 
12
(11) consistent with the multiple-use mission 
13
described in paragraph (10), this Act— 
14
(A) ensures the continued protection of so-
15
cial and ecological values, while allowing for 
16
many multiple uses of inventoried roadless 
17
areas; and 
18
(B) does not impose any new limitations 
19
on— 
20
(i) inventoried roadless areas; or 
21
(ii) the use of, or access to, National 
22
Forest System, State, or private land out-
23
side inventoried roadless areas;

•HR 279 IH
(12) enacting a law for the protection of inven-
1
toried roadless areas— 
2
(A) provides additional reliability to areas 
3
with recreation-based economies that depend on 
4
public land without roads for jobs, revenue, and 
5
consumer spending; and 
6
(B) encourages forest managers to con-
7
tinue giving priority to conducting fuel reduc-
8
tion treatments in the areas in which the treat-
9
ments will have the most impact; 
10
(13) wildfires are almost twice as likely to occur 
11
in roaded areas as in roadless areas, because road-
12
less areas are generally located further away from 
13
communities and are harder to access; 
14
(14) the Forest Service has an enormous back-
15
log of maintenance needs for the existing 371,581- 
16
mile road system of the Forest Service that will cost 
17
$3,200,000,000 to eliminate; and 
18
(15) continued protection of roadless areas will 
19
continue to allow for the development of hydropower 
20
projects. 
21
(b) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act is to provide, 
22
within the context of multiple-use management, lasting 
23
protection for inventoried roadless areas within the Na-
24
tional Forest System.
