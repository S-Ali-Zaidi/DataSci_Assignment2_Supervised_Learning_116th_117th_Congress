RESOLUTION 
Commemorating the 100-year anniversary of the fall of 
Kronstadt, which took place on March 18, 1921. 
Whereas the Kronstadt revolution began in Soviet Russia on 
March 1, 1918, and ended on March 18, 1921; 
Whereas the Kronstadt revolution began as a workers’ and 
veterans’ revolt against the bureaucratic and authori-
tarian excess of Lenin and Trotsky, and ended as a testa-
ment to the totalitarian impulse of Marxism; 
Whereas after their brave stand, members of the Kronstadt 
resistance were eventually slaughtered, and many fled to 
exile, seeking elsewhere the freedom and prosperity that 
the Soviets had promised them; 
Whereas the Kronstadt rebels took every step within their 
power to avoid violent rebellion, and their remonstrations

with Soviet authorities to abide by the principles of the 
1917 revolution were ultimately unsuccessful; 
Whereas the Kronstadt exposed the authoritarian tendencies 
of Soviet Russia, and after the Kronstadt revolution, it 
was obvious that Soviet Russia had no interest in any 
value beyond power; 
Whereas the Kronstadt revolution further presaged the totali-
tarian excesses of communism globally, and every com-
munist revolution eventually has a Kronstadt; 
Whereas the Kronstadt revolution exposed the fact that com-
munism is ultimately antihuman and that the things that 
make communism possible are repression, fear, and theft; 
Whereas the Kronstadt revolution exposed the hypocrisy of 
communist pretensions to caring about the working class 
and that when given a choice between workers and power, 
communists chose power every time; 
Whereas the Kronstadt revolution gave us all reasons to op-
pose Marxism and communism in all forms; 
Whereas the failed dream that the Kronstadt revolution rep-
resents should be a wakeup call for all of us; 
Whereas Marxism is toxic and dangerous because it provides 
an incentive to commit violence and murder; 
Whereas the Kronstadt revolution gave us reasons to be 
grateful for our system of government and our history, 
complete with its scars; 
Whereas the United States Government has been nowhere 
close to perfect for its history, but the story of our coun-
try shows gradual, frustrating but inexorable progress; 
Whereas the Kronstadt revolution showed us the differences 
between revolutions in the United States verses revolu-
