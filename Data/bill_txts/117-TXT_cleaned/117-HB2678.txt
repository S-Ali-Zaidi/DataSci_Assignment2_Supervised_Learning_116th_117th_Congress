SEC. 2. RULEMAKING TO INCREASE THE EFFECTIVENESS 
1
OF INTERREGIONAL TRANSMISSION PLAN-
2
NING. 
3
(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 180 days after the 
4
date of enactment of this Act, the Federal Energy Regu-
5
latory Commission shall initiate a rulemaking address-
6
ing— 
7
(1) the effectiveness of existing planning proc-
8
esses for identifying interregional transmission 
9
projects that provide economic, reliability, oper-
10
ational, public policy, and environmental benefits 
11
(including reductions in carbon emissions), taking 
12
into consideration the public interest, the integrity of 
13
markets, and the protection of consumers; 
14
(2) changes to the processes described in para-
15
graph (1) to ensure that efficient, cost-effective, and 
16
broadly beneficial interregional transmission solu-
17
tions are selected for cost allocation, taking into con-
18
sideration— 
19
(A) the public interest; 
20
(B) the integrity of markets; 
21
(C) the protection of consumers; 
22
(D) the broad range of economic, reli-
23
ability, operational, public policy, and environ-
24
mental benefits that interregional transmission

provides, including reductions in carbon emis-
1
sions; 
2
(E) the need for single projects to secure 
3
approvals based on a comprehensive assessment 
4
of the multiple benefits provided; 
5
(F) that projects that meet interregional 
6
benefit criteria should not be subject to subse-
7
quent reassessment by transmission planning 
8
authorities; 
9
(G) the importance of synchronization of 
10
planning processes in neighboring regions, such 
11
as using a joint model on a consistent timeline 
12
with a single set of needs, input assumptions, 
13
and benefit metrics; 
14
(H) that evaluation of long-term scenarios 
15
should align with the expected life of a trans-
16
mission asset; 
17
(I) that transmission planning authorities 
18
should allow for the identification and joint 
19
evaluation of alternatives proposed by stake-
20
holders; 
21
(J) that interregional planning should be 
22
done regularly and not less frequently than 
23
once every 3 years; and

(K) the elimination of arbitrary project 
1
voltage, size, or cost requirements for inter-
2
regional solutions; and 
3
(3) cost allocation methodologies that reflect 
4
the multiple benefits provided by interregional trans-
5
mission solutions, including economic, reliability, 
6
operational, public policy, and environmental bene-
7
fits (including reductions in carbon emissions). 
8
(b) TIMING.—Not later than 18 months after the 
9
date of enactment of this Act, the Federal Energy Regu-
10
latory Commission shall promulgate a final rule to com-
11
plete the rulemaking initiated under subsection (a).
