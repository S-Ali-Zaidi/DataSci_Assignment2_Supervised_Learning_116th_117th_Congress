SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Repeal Existing Poli-
2
cies that Encourage and Allow Legal HIV Discrimination 
3
Act of 2022’’ or the ‘‘REPEAL HIV Discrimination Act 
4
of 2022’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
The Congress makes the following findings: 
7
(1) At present, 31 States and 2 United States 
8
territories have criminal statutes based on perceived 
9
exposure to HIV, rather than behaviors motivated by 
10
an intent to harm, presenting a significant risk of 
11
transmission and resulting in actual transmission of 
12
HIV to another. Eleven States have HIV-specific 
13
laws that make spitting or biting a felony, even 
14
though it is not possible to transmit HIV via saliva. 
15
Twenty-four States require persons who are aware 
16
that they have HIV to disclose their status to sexual 
17
partners, regardless of whether they are non-infec-
18
tious. Fourteen of these 24 States also require dis-
19
closure to needle-sharing partners. Twenty-five 
20
States criminalize one or more behaviors that pose 
21
a low or negligible risk for HIV transmission. 
22
(2) HIV-specific criminal laws are classified as 
23
felonies in 28 States. Eighteen States impose sen-
24
tences of up to 10 years per violation; seven impose 
25
21:53 Dec 10, 2021
H6111
3 
•HR 6111 IH
sentences between 11 and 20 years; and five impose 
1
sentences of greater than 20 years. 
2
(3) When members of the Armed Forces ac-
3
quire HIV, they are issued orders that require them 
4
to disclose and use a condom under all cir-
5
cumstances including when the known risk of trans-
6
mission is zero. Failure to disclose can result in 
7
prosecution under the Uniform Code of Military Jus-
8
tice. 
9
(4) The number of prosecutions, arrests, and 
10
instances where HIV-based charges are used to in-
11
duce plea agreements is unknown. Because State- 
12
level prosecution and arrest data are not readily 
13
available in any national legal database, the societal 
14
impact of these laws may be underestimated and 
15
most cases that end in a plea arrangement or go to 
16
trial are not reduced to written, published opinions. 
17
(5) State and Federal criminal law does not 
18
currently reflect the four decades of medical ad-
19
vances and discoveries made with regard to trans-
20
mission and treatment of HIV/AIDS. 
21
(6) According to CDC, correct and consistent 
22
male or female condom use, or adherence to a pre- 
23
exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) regimen that results in 
24
viral suppression, are very effective in preventing 
25
21:53 Dec 10, 2021
H6111
4 
•HR 6111 IH
HIV transmission. However, most State HIV-spe-
1
cific laws and prosecutions do not treat the use of 
2
a condom during sexual intercourse or adherence to 
3
PrEP as a mitigating factor or evidence that the de-
4
fendant did not intend to transmit HIV. 
5
(7) Criminal laws and prosecutions do not take 
6
into account the benefits of effective antiretroviral 
7
medications, which suppress the virus to extremely 
8
low levels and further reduce the already low risk of 
9
transmitting HIV to effectively zero. 
10
(8) In addition to HIV-specific criminal laws, 
11
general criminal laws are often misused to prosecute 
12
people based on their HIV status. Although HIV, 
13
and even AIDS, currently is viewed as a treatable, 
14
chronic, medical condition, people living with HIV 
15
have been charged under aggravated assault, at-
16
tempted murder, and even bioterrorism statutes be-
17
cause prosecutors, courts, and legislators continue to 
18
view and characterize the blood, semen, and saliva of 
19
people living with HIV as a ‘‘deadly weapon’’. 
20
(9) Multiple peer-reviewed studies demonstrate 
21
that HIV-specific laws do not reduce risk-taking be-
22
havior or increase disclosure by people living with 
23
HIV, and there is increasing evidence that these 
24
laws reduce the willingness to get tested. Further-
25

more, placing legal responsibility for preventing the 
1
transmission of HIV and other pathogens that can 
2
be sexually transmitted exclusively on people diag-
3
nosed with a sexually transmitted infection under-
4
mines the public health message that all people are 
5
responsible for practicing behaviors that protect 
6
themselves from HIV and other sexually transmitted 
7
infections. Unfortunately, some State laws create an 
8
expectation of disclosure work against public health 
9
communication and discourage risk-reduction meas-
10
ures that could prevent transmission as a result of 
11
those who are acutely infected and unaware of their 
12
status. 
13
(10) The identity of an individual subject to an 
14
HIV-based prosecution is broadcast through media 
15
reports, potentially destroying employment opportu-
16
nities and relationships and violating the person’s 
17
right to privacy. 
18
(11) Individuals who are convicted after an 
19
HIV-based prosecution often must register as sex of-
20
fenders in at least six States for consensual sexual 
21
behavior. Their employability, housing, and par-
22
enting options are jeopardized and their family rela-
23
tionships are fractured.

(12) The United Nations, including the Joint 
1
United 
Nations 
Programme 
on 
HIV/AIDS 
2
(UNAIDS), urges governments to ‘‘limit criminaliza-
3
tion to cases of intentional transmission.’’ This re-
4
quirement would limit prosecutions to situations 
5
‘‘where a person knows his or her HIV-positive sta-
6
tus, acts with the intention to transmit HIV, and 
7
does in fact transmit it’’. UNAIDS also recommends 
8
that criminal law should not be applied to cases 
9
where there is no significant risk of transmission. 
10
(13) In 2010, the Federal Government released 
11
the first ever National HIV/AIDS Strategy (NHAS), 
12
which addressed HIV-specific criminal laws, stating: 
13
‘‘While we understand the intent behind these laws, 
14
they may not have the desired effect and they may 
15
make people less willing to disclose their status by 
16
making people feel at even greater risk of discrimi-
17
nation. In some cases, it may be appropriate for leg-
18
islators to reconsider whether existing laws continue 
19
to further the public interest and public health. In 
20
many instances, the continued existence and enforce-
21
ment of these types of laws run counter to scientific 
22
evidence about routes of HIV transmission and may 
23
undermine the public health goals of promoting HIV 
24
screening and treatment.’’. The NHAS also states 
25
21:53 Dec 10, 2021
H6111
7 
•HR 6111 IH
that State legislatures should consider reviewing 
1
HIV-specific criminal statutes to ensure that they 
2
are consistent with current knowledge of HIV trans-
3
mission and support public health approaches to pre-
4
venting and treating HIV. 
5
(14) The Global Commission on HIV and the 
6
Law was launched in June 2010 to examine laws 
7
and practices that criminalize people living with and 
8
vulnerable to HIV and to develop evidence-based rec-
9
ommendations for effective HIV responses. The 
10
Commission calls for ‘‘governments, civil society and 
11
international bodies to repeal punitive laws and 
12
enact laws that facilitate and enable effective re-
13
sponses to HIV prevention, care and treatment serv-
14
ices for all who need them’’. The Commission rec-
15
ommends against the enactment of ‘‘laws that ex-
16
plicitly criminalize HIV transmission, exposure or 
17
non-disclosure of HIV status, which are counter-
18
productive’’. 
19
(15) In February 2019, the Department of 
20
Health and Human Services (HHS) launched ‘‘End-
21
ing the HIV Epidemic: A Plan for America,’’ a new 
22
initiative with an ambitious goal to end the domestic 
23
HIV epidemic in ten years by reducing new cases of 
24
HIV by 75 percent by 2025 and by 90 percent by 
25
21:53 Dec 10, 2021
H6111
8 
•HR 6111 IH
2030. In this plan, HHS notes that stigma ‘‘can be 
1
a debilitating barrier preventing people living with, 
2
or at risk for, HIV from receiving the health care, 
3
services, and respect they need and deserve.’’ Many 
4
of the States and jurisdictions identified as a pri-
5
ority for the first five years of the plan have stigma- 
6
based criminal statutes for perceived exposure to 
7
HIV. These statutes run counter to the goals of this 
8
new initiative and stand in the way of ending the do-
9
mestic HIV epidemic.
