CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the recognition of March 10, 2022, 
as ‘‘Abortion Provider Appreciation Day’’. 
Whereas March 10 has been established as a day to show ap-
preciation for the essential, high-quality care that abor-
tion providers and clinic staff provide to their commu-
nities and those traveling to their communities, and to 
celebrate their courage, compassion, and dedication to 
their work; 
Whereas this date is established in honor of Dr. David Gunn 
who was killed outside his abortion clinic in Pensacola, 
Florida, by a White supremacist, antiabortion extremist, 
in the first known instance of the murder of an abortion 
provider on March 10, 1993;

Whereas abortion providers and clinic staff play a critical role 
in a world where people must be able to make essential 
and time-sensitive decisions about their bodies, lives, and 
futures; 
Whereas abortion providers and clinic staff help to ensure 
that all people who can become pregnant can make their 
own decisions about their bodies and their pregnancies, 
and support their patients’ decisions by treating them 
with dignity, empathy, compassion, and respect; 
Whereas abortion providers and clinic staff play an essential 
role within the reproductive justice framework, which was 
created by a group of Black women in 1994 who deter-
mined the necessity of adopting a human rights frame-
work that demands every person has the human right to 
bodily autonomy, which includes if, when, and how to 
have children, to not have children, and to parent the 
children they have in safe and sustainable communities; 
Whereas people seeking abortion care across the United 
States also rely on the work of abortion funds and prac-
tical support organizations to access abortion care for 
themselves and their families; 
Whereas abortion funds and practical support organizations 
that rely on donations face increasing demand as people 
are forced into the vicious cycle of having to travel longer 
distances, find childcare or lodging, and raise money to 
obtain an abortion and cover associated costs; 
Whereas restrictions on accessing abortion care have far- 
reaching consequences in both deepening existing inequi-
ties caused by structural racism and systemic discrimina-
tion in the maternal health care system and worsening

health outcomes for pregnant people, people giving birth, 
and their families; 
Whereas abortion care restrictions in some States have forced 
many abortion clinics to shut down, such that 90 percent 
of counties in the United States today do not have an 
abortion provider, the number of independent abortion 
clinics in the United States has declined by one-third 
since 2012, and efforts to undermine critical supports for 
patients, including family planning supports, have further 
threatened the work of abortion providers; 
Whereas restricting access to abortion care creates and in-
creases the out-of-pocket costs and logistical burdens that 
patients face to get care while exposing the remaining 
abortion providers and staff to increased levels of harass-
ment and politically motivated restrictions; 
Whereas the National Abortion Federation’s 2020 statistics 
on violence and disruption found an alarming escalation 
in incidents of obstruction, vandalism, and trespassing at 
abortion clinics, with abortion providers reporting an in-
crease in death threats and threats of harm from 92 inci-
dents in 2019 to 200 in 2020; 
Whereas Black, indigenous, and other providers and patients 
of color face heightened levels of threats, harassment, 
and violence as compared to their White counterparts; 
Whereas 2021 marked the worst year for abortion rights 
since Roe v. Wade (410 U.S. 113 (1973)) was decided, 
and the passage and enforcement of restrictions on abor-
tion access and the criminalization of abortion has 
emboldened antiabortion individuals and groups to con-
tinue to harass providers and the patients they care for;

•HCON 78 IH 
Whereas the Supreme Court of the United States is now (as 
of the date of adoption of this resolution) considering 
Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization (141 
S.Ct. 2619 (2021)), a case that the Justices could use to 
overturn or severely undermine Roe v. Wade, and at the 
same time has refused to block Texas’s blatantly uncon-
stitutional ban on abortion at approximately 6 weeks of 
pregnancy, allowing Texas to ban the majority of abor-
tions in the State; 
Whereas the ripple effects of Texas’s abortion ban have been 
felt by communities and abortion providers across the 
country as abortion clinics try to absorb the massive in-
flux of Texas’s patients who have the resources to travel 
and are seeking abortion care elsewhere; 
Whereas should the Supreme Court overturn or severely un-
dermine Roe v. Wade, Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Flor-
ida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, 
Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, 
North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South 
Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia, Wis-
consin, and Wyoming could act as soon as possible to 
prohibit abortion and criminalize abortion providers; 
Whereas Roe v. Wade alone has never been sufficient to en-
sure that all people, especially Black people, indigenous 
people, people of color, working class and low-income peo-
ple, LGBTQIA+ people, people who are immigrants, 
younger people, people with disabilities, geographically 
isolated people, and people with multimarginal identities, 
can get the abortion care they need; 
Whereas the unraveling or overturning of Roe v. Wade 
threatens the ability of abortion providers and the clinic 
staff who support them to serve their patients; and

Whereas in the face of multifaceted attacks on their work, 
abortion providers remain an essential and valued part of 
their communities, providing high-quality, compassionate, 
and necessary health care, and courageously delivering 
this care despite pressures, restrictions, political inter-
ference, and violent threats to their personal safety: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate

concurring), That Congress—

Day to celebrate the courage, compassion, and high-

(2) lauds communities across the country who

(3) affirms Congress’ commitment to ensuring

14
tion care no matter where they live, free from fear
