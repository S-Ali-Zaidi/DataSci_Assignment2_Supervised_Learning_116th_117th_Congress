fringed, a patent regarding COVID–19 related products 
9
and bear liability or owe compensation to another, if— 
10

12
that— 
13

9
munication is presumed to have been sent in bad faith if,

after receiving a written request by the recipient to provide 
11
any of the information required in subsection (a)(3) or a 
12
patent claim reasonably believed to have been infringed, 
13

ent within 10 business days after the date on which the 
15
request is received.

18
statement, representation, or omission was not made in 
19
bad faith (as defined in subparagraphs (B) or (C) of sec-
20
tion 4(1)) if the sender can demonstrate that such state-
21
ment, representation, or omission was a mistake made in 
22
good faith, which may be demonstrated by a preponder-
23
ance of evidence that the violation was not intentional and 
24
resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding the main-
