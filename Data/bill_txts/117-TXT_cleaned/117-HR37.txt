ARTICLE I: WEAPONIZATION OF HATE 
1
In his conduct while President of the United States, 
2
unmindful of the high duties of his high office and the 
3
dignity and proprieties thereof, and of the harmony and 
4
courtesies necessary for stability within the society of the 
5
United States, Donald John Trump—in violation of his 
6
constitutional oath faithfully to execute the office of Presi-
7
dent of the United States and, to the best of his ability, 
8
preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the 
9
United States, and, in violation of his constitutional duty 
10
to take care that the laws be faithfully executed—has 
11
harmed the society of the United States, brought shame 
12
and dishonor to the office of the President of the United 
13
States, sowing discord among the people of the United 
14
States by weaponizing hate for political gain. 
15
On December 19, 2020, President Donald John 
16
Trump tweeted, promoting a protest in Washington, DC, 
17
to be held in the weeks to come: ‘‘Big protest in D.C. on 
18
January 6th. Be there, will be wild!’’. 
19
On January 6, 2021, in a speech at the National 
20
Mall, President Donald John Trump weaponized the hate 
21
that resulted in violence, the deaths of multiple people, 
22
an assault on democracy, and an insurrection against the 
23
Capitol of the United States of America, by inciting a 
24
mob, infected with white supremacists, carrying a rebel

flag, erecting a gallows structure with a noose, wearing 
1
shirts with hateful messages, such as ‘‘Camp Auschwitz: 
2
Work Brings Freedom’’ and ‘‘MAGA Civil War January 
3
6, 2021’’. He told them: 
4
‘‘All of us here today do not want to see our 
5
election victory stolen by a bold and radical left 
6
Democrats, which is what they are doing, and stolen 
7
by the fake news media. That is what they have 
8
done and what they are doing. We will never give 
9
up. We will never concede. It doesn’t happen. You 
10
don’t concede when there’s theft involved.’’. 
11
The President further emboldened them, saying: 
12
‘‘. . . you’ll never take back our country with weakness. 
13
You have to show strength and you have to be strong.’’. 
14
After his National Mall speech, a mob of his sup-
15
porters proceeded to the Capitol complex, breaching its se-
16
curity for approximately six hours. They—without wearing 
17
face coverings—broke windows and spread blood and fecal 
18
matter in the hallways. 
19
As further evidence of President Donald John 
20
Trump’s complicity, when things became unmanageable, 
21
he said, in a video posted to Twitter: ‘‘These are the things 
22
and events that happen when a sacred landslide election 
23
victory is so unceremoniously and viciously stripped away

from great patriots who have been badly and unfairly 
1
treated for so long.’’. 
2
The President finally told the insurrectionists to go 
3
home, saying: ‘‘So go home, we love you, you’re very spe-
4
cial, you’ve seen what happens, you’ve seen the way others 
5
are treated that are so bad and so evil. I know how you 
6
feel but go home and go home in peace.’’. 
7
In all of this, the aforementioned Donald John 
8
Trump has weaponized hate, by his statements, unmindful 
9
of the high duties of his high office and the dignities and 
10
proprieties thereof and of the harmony, respect, and cour-
11
tesies necessary for stability within the society of the 
12
United States, has undermined the integrity of his high 
13
office, has sown discord among the people of the United 
14
States, has brought disrepute, contempt, ridicule and dis-
15
grace on the Presidency, has acted in a manner subversive 
16
to the rule of law and justice resulting in lives lost, and 
17
has betrayed his trust as President to the manifest injury 
18
of the people of the United States. 
19
Wherefore, to prevent additional harm to society, 
20
Donald John Trump by such conduct warrants immediate 
21
impeachment, trial, and removal from office and disquali-
22
fication to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust or 
23
profit under the United States.
