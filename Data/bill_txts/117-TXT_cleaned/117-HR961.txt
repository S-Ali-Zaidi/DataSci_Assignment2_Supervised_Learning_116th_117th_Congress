RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the House wing of the United States Capitol and House 
Office Buildings be open and accessible to the public. 
Whereas the United States Capitol has been closed to the 
public since March 12, 2020; 
Whereas the Capitol is a symbol of democracy that millions 
of people visit each year; 
Whereas the Government of the United States derives its 
power from the consent of the governed, and the Amer-
ican people have a constitutional right to be heard;

•HRES 961 IH 
Whereas the right of people to petition their Government is 
severely hindered by the closure of the Capitol and the 
people’s House; 
Whereas the Capitol had only been closed briefly 3 times 
since the beginning of the 20th century: during the Span-
ish flu pandemic, after the assassination of Rev. Martin 
Luther King, Jr., and after the September 11 and an-
thrax attacks in 2001; 
Whereas this is the longest closure of the Capitol in history, 
with no end in sight; 
Whereas, while the public is still unable to use the Capitol 
Visitor Center, the vast majority of State capitols across 
the country are open to the public; 
Whereas schools are operating in person safely around the 
country; and 
Whereas sporting events are being widely attended safely 
around the country: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, 
That the House of Representatives
