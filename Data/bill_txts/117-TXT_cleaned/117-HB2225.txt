A BILL 
To authorize appropriations for fiscal years 2022, 2023, 
2024, 2025, and 2026 for the National Science Founda-
tion, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Over the past seven decades, the National 
8
Science Foundation has played a critical role in ad-

•HR 2225 IH
vancing the United States academic research enter-
1
prise by supporting fundamental research and edu-
2
cation across science and engineering disciplines. 
3
(2) Discoveries enabled by sustained investment 
4
in fundamental research and the education of the 
5
United States science and engineering workforce 
6
have led to transformational innovations and 
7
spawned new industries. 
8
(3) While the traditional approach to invest-
9
ment in research has delivered myriad benefits to so-
10
ciety, a concerted effort is needed to ensure the ben-
11
efits of federally funded science and engineering are 
12
enjoyed by all Americans. 
13
(4) As countries around the world increase in-
14
vestments in research and STEM education, United 
15
States global leadership in science and engineering is 
16
eroding, posing significant risks to economic com-
17
petitiveness, national security, and public well-being. 
18
(5) To address major societal challenges and 
19
sustain United States leadership in innovation, the 
20
Federal Government must increase investments in 
21
research, broaden participation in the STEM work-
22
force, and bolster collaborations among universities, 
23
National 
Laboratories, 
companies, 
non-profit
