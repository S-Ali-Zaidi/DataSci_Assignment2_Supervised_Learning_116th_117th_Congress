RESOLUTION 
Commemorating the 50th anniversary of the National Center 
for Toxicological Research. 
Whereas, in 1971, President Richard Nixon established the 
National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR) in 
Jefferson, Arkansas, as a part of the United States Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) to provide scientific 
proof that United States consumers are protected from 
toxic chemicals, drugs, and other agents and otherwise 
determine safe levels of substances when appropriate; 
Whereas the FDA is responsible for regulating the Nation’s 
domestically produced and imported food, cosmetics, 
drugs, vaccines, blood, biologics, medical devices, radi-
ation-emitting products, animal and veterinary products, 
and tobacco products, as well as overseeing the safety of

every American life and more than $1 trillion worth of 
consumer goods, which are estimated to include $466 bil-
lion in food sales, $275 billion in drugs, $60 billion in 
cosmetics, and $18 billion in vitamin supplements; 
Whereas the NCTR is a research institution with more than 
one million square feet of facilities, with 123 laboratories 
across 30 buildings in Jefferson, Arkansas, with 680 em-
ployees who reside in 17 counties across Arkansas, and 
contributes approximately $70 million to the local, State, 
and national economies, including investments of approxi-
mately $10 million annually via construction, mainte-
nance, and renovation projects that stimulate the local 
economy; 
Whereas, in 2011, the FDA and the State of Arkansas com-
posed a framework for a formal working relationship to 
foster stronger partnerships, leverage vital resources, and 
operate collaboratively to promote efficiency that has 
been continually renewed and supported by both parties; 
Whereas the NCTR has a long history of providing scientific 
advice and training to researchers in government, aca-
demia, and industry at local, State, national, and inter-
national levels, exemplified by training Ph.D. candidates 
and other researchers from Arkansas universities, col-
laborating with Arkansas university researchers, and pro-
viding millions of dollars in funding for Arkansas univer-
sity research; 
Whereas the mutual benefits between the NCTR and the 
State of Arkansas can only continue if the NCTR re-
mains robustly supported by the Federal Government; 
Whereas the benefits of the NCTR were heightened during 
the COVID–19 emergency when the Director of the

NCTR, Dr. William Slikker, worked with the State to 
rapidly provide critical COVID–19 testing equipment to

Whereas the NCTR will hold a 50th anniversary celebration 
on August 11, 2021, in Jefferson, Arkansas: Now, there-
fore, be it
