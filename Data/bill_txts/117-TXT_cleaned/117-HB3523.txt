A BILL 
To require the Secretary of Transportation to promulgate 
standards and regulations requiring all new commercial 
motor vehicles to be equipped with technology to limit 
maximum operating speed, to require existing speed-lim-
iting technologies already installed in commercial motor 
vehicles manufactured after 1992 to be used while in 
operation, and to require that the maximum safe oper-
ating speed of commercial motor vehicles shall not exceed

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that— 
9
(1) according to the Federal Motor Carrier 
10
Safety Administration, during the period beginning 
11
on January 1, 2004, and ending on December 31, 
12
2013, 10,440 people were killed in motor vehicle 
13
crashes in which the speed of a commercial motor 
14
vehicle likely contributed to severity; 
15
(2) a 2007 survey of truck drivers by the Insur-
16
ance Institute for Highway Safety determined that 
17
64 percent of the drivers were in favor of a speed- 
18
limiting requirement; 
19
(3) according to a 2012 study commissioned by 
20
the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, 
21
trucks not using a speed-limiting technology had a 
22
speed limit-relevant crash rate almost 2 times higher

than the rate of trucks using a speed-limiting tech-
1
nology; 
2
(4) speed-limiting devices have been required to 
3
be installed and used on commercial motor vehicles 
4
throughout the world, including in— 
5
(A) Australia, which has required the use 
6
of those devices since 1990; 
7
(B) the United Kingdom, which has re-
8
quired the use of those devices since 1992; and 
9
(C) the European Union, which has re-
10
quired the use of those devices since 1994; and 
11
(5) the Department of Transportation has been 
12
examining the issues involving speed-limiting tech-
13
nologies since at least 2006.

(4) SECRETARY.—The term ‘‘Secretary’’ means 
15
the Secretary of Transportation. 
16

2
tration, issue a final rule that— 
3
(i) establishes a Federal motor vehicle 
4
safety standard that requires that all com-
5
mercial motor vehicles manufactured after 
6
the effective date of the standard shall be 
7
equipped with a speed-limiting technology; 
8
and

22
shall be used at any time during which the com-
23
mercial motor vehicle is in operation, in accord-
