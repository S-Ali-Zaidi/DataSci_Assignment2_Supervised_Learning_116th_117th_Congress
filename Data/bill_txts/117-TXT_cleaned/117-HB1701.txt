•HR 1701 IH
(1) Business investment in the United States 
1
by both domestic and foreign firms, whether in the 
2
form of new equipment or facilities or the expansion 
3
of existing facilities, is a major engine of economic 
4
growth and job creation. Increasing exports from 
5
and investment in rural areas will expand the United 
6
States economy and create United States jobs. 
7
(2) Rural areas often have greater challenges in 
8
attracting business investment, especially because 
9
rural areas do not always have economic develop-
10
ment organizations to advance their local economic 
11
interests. When a rural area does have a local eco-
12
nomic development organization, it may not have the 
13
capacity or funding to compete effectively with larg-
14
er rivals worldwide. 
15
(3) Due to their geographic location, rural 
16
United States businesses often have limited access to 
17
information and services that facilitate export suc-
18
cess.
