A BILL 
To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide 
for the issuance of exempt facility bonds for qualified 
carbon dioxide capture facilities. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Carbon Capture Im-
4
provement Act of 2021’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Capture and long-term storage of carbon di-
8
oxide from coal, natural gas, and biomass-fired

power plants, as well as from industrial sectors such 
1
as oil refining and production of fertilizer, cement, 
2
and ethanol, can help protect the environment while 
3
improving the economy and national security of the 
4
United States. 
5
(2) The United States is a world leader in the 
6
field of carbon dioxide capture and long-term stor-
7
age, with many manufacturers and licensors of car-
8
bon dioxide capture technology based in the United 
9
States. 
10
(3) While the prospects for large-scale carbon 
11
capture in the United States are promising, costs re-
12
main relatively high. Lowering the financing costs 
13
for carbon dioxide capture at industrial facilities and 
14
direct air capture projects would accelerate the de-
15
ployment of these technologies. 
16
(4) Since 1968, tax-exempt private activity 
17
bonds have been used to provide access to lower-cost 
18
financing for private businesses that are purchasing 
19
new capital equipment for certain specified environ-
20
mental facilities, including facilities that reduce, re-
21
cycle, or dispose of waste, pollutants, and hazardous 
22
substances.

(5) Allowing tax-exempt financing for the pur-
24
chase of capital equipment that is used to capture

carbon dioxide will reduce the costs of developing 
1
carbon dioxide capture projects, accelerate their de-
2
ployment, and, in conjunction with carbon dioxide 
3
utilization and long-term storage, help the United 
4
States meet critical environmental, economic, and 
5
national security goals.
