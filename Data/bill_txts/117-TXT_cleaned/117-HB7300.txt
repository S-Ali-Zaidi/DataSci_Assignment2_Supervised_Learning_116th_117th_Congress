(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:

•HR 7300 IH
(1) The dark web is made up of websites and 
1
other network services that leverage overlay net-
2
works providing anonymity. These overlay networks 
3
use the internet but require specific software and 
4
configurations to access. The overlay networks use 
5
multiple encrypted traffic relays for which an indi-
6
vidual relay computer knows its source of informa-
7
tion and where the individual computer is sending 
8
the information but never knows both the original 
9
source and ultimate destination of the traffic simul-
10
taneously. This anonymity has provided criminals 
11
with the ability to host illicit material in a way that 
12
circumvents the ability of law enforcement agencies 
13
to serve legal process to remove or effectively inves-
14
tigate websites offering illegal content or goods for 
15
purchase or sharing. 
16
(2) Dark web marketplaces include e-commerce 
17
websites based on the dark web on which individuals 
18
use virtual currencies to engage in transactions in-
19
volving drugs, weapons, malware, counterfeit cur-
20
rency, stolen credit cards, personal identifying infor-
21
mation, forged documents, unlicensed pharma-
22
ceuticals, and other illicit goods.

•HR 7300 IH
(3) Due to the anonymity provided by the dark 
1
web, illicit activities can be hosted from anywhere in 
2
the world without accountability to— 
3
(A) the Federal Government; 
4
(B) Federal laws; or 
5
(C) any other government or system of 
6
laws. 
7
(4) The use of the dark web to distribute illegal 
8
drugs has contributed and continues to contribute to 
9
the substance abuse crisis that is devastating com-
10
munities across the United States. This devastation 
11
is due in large part to the fact that the dark web 
12
has made illicit goods obtainable anonymously. 
13
(5) Law enforcement agencies at every level of 
14
government continue to investigate drug trafficking 
15
and the sale of illegal goods and services through the 
16
dark web that occurs as a result of interactions on 
17
the dark web, both within the United States and at 
18
the international border of the United States, but 
19
the increased anonymity the internet provides has 
20
made it more difficult to identify and prosecute the 
21
individuals and organizations who— 
22
(A) 
administer 
or 
otherwise 
operate 
23
websites on the dark web that facilitate the dis-
24
tribution of illegal drugs, goods, or services; or

(B) buy and sell illegal drugs, goods, or

the dark web.

(6) Despite difficulties in identifying and locat-
4
ing individuals and organizations who engage in 
5
drug trafficking on the dark web, law enforcement 
6
agencies have been effective in investigating and 
7
prosecuting the distribution of illegal drugs through 
8
illicit marketplaces on the dark web, as evidenced by 
9
Operation DisrupTor, which— 
10
(A) was announced in September 2020; 
11
(B) resulted in— 
12
(i) 179 arrests worldwide, including 
13
121 arrests in the United States;

(ii) the seizure of approximately 500 
15
kilograms of drugs worldwide, including 
16
274 kilograms of drugs in the United 
17

seizure

drugs and pose a unique threat to the public health
