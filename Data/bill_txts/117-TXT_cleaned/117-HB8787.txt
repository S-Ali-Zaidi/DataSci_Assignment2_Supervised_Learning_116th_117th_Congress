(2) The American Academy of Sleep Medicine 
1
recommends 8 to 10 hours of sleep per day for teen-
2
agers aged 13 to 18 years, but early school start 
3
times are contributing to lack of sleep among adoles-
4
cents. 
5
(3) Despite the shift in biological rhythms dur-
6
ing puberty, which causes adolescents to sleep later 
7
at night and wake later in the morning, 82 percent 
8
of public high schools and 79 percent of public mid-
9
dle schools in the United States started before 8:30 
10
a.m. in the 2017–2018 school year. 
11
(4) The State of California became the first 
12
State to enact a law to move back school start times 
13
beginning in the 2022–2023 school year. 
14
(5) Numerous local educational agencies across 
15
46 States have also recently changed or are consid-
16
ering changing school start times in an effort to im-
17
prove adolescent health, well-being, and perform-
18
ance.

(6) The American Academy of Pediatrics has 
20
strongly supported efforts to optimize sleep in stu-
21
