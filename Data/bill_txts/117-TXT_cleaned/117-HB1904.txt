•HR 1904 IH
(1) the digital divide falls along racial and eco-
1
nomic lines; 
2
(2) during the COVID-19 pandemic, research 
3
determined that African American and Hispanic 
4
households were 1.3 to 1.4 times as likely as White 
5
households to experience limited accessibility to the 
6
internet; 
7
(3) 44 percent of low-income Americans who 
8
make less than $30,000 did not have home 
9
broadband services in 2019; and 
10
(4) low-income families and individuals living in 
11
federally assisted housing often lack access to high- 
12
quality broadband, and monthly broadband costs can 
13
be prohibitively expensive, which limits their ability 
14
to undertake essential activities, including remote 
15
healthcare visits, school assignments, job searches, 
16
and obtaining information about supportive re-
17
sources.
