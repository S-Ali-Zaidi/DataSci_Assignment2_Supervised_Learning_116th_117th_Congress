A BILL 
To require a study of the barriers to conservation practice 
adoption on leased agricultural land, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Conservation for Agri-
4
cultural Leased Land Act’’ or the ‘‘CALL Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) According to a 2016 study by the Economic 
8
Research Service of the Department of Agriculture, 
9
39 percent of agricultural land in the United States

is leased, including the majority (53 percent) of 
1
cropland. 
2
(2) The participation of landowners and tenants 
3
in Federal, State, and local conservation programs, 
4
and the adoption of conservation practices on land 
5
that they own or manage, can be limited by a wide 
6
range of factors that are not fully understood. 
7
(3) Much of the limited information that is 
8
known comes from the Tenure, Ownership, and 
9
Transition of Agricultural Land (TOTAL) Survey 
10
conducted by the National Agricultural Statistics 
11
Service, in collaboration with the Economic Research 
12
Service; regularly recurring data collection through 
13
the TOTAL Survey and other Department of Agri-
14
culture reports is vital to understanding land tenure 
15
trends, challenges, and opportunities. 
16
(4) Some of the potential barriers to such par-
17
ticipation and adoption include the structure or term 
18
of the lease or rental agreement, the level of inde-
19
pendence given to the operator, the awareness of the 
20
landowner of both conservation practice and pro-
21
gram opportunities and the costs and benefits asso-
22
ciated with those opportunities, and other policy or 
23
market factors.

(5) The solutions to these issues are unlikely to 
1
be ‘‘one size fits all’’ and must be better understood.
