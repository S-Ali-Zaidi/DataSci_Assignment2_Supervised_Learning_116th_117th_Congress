SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
5
Congress makes the following findings: 
6
(1) Taiwan is a free and prosperous democracy 
7
of nearly 24,000,000 people, an important contrib-
8
utor to peace and stability around the world, and 
9
continues to embody and promote democratic values, 
10
freedom, and human rights in Asia. 
11
(2) The policy of the United States toward Tai-
12
wan is guided by the Taiwan Relations Act (22 
13
U.S.C. 3301 et seq.), the United States-People’s Re-

public of China joint communique´s concluded in 
1
1972, 1978, and 1982, and the Six Assurances that 
2
President Ronald Reagan communicated to Taiwan 
3
in 1982. 
4
(3) Under section 2 of the Taiwan Relations 
5
Act (22 U.S.C. 3301), it is the policy of the United 
6
States— 
7
(A) ‘‘to preserve and promote extensive, 
8
close, and friendly commercial, cultural, and 
9
other relations between the people of the United 
10
States and the people on Taiwan, as well as the 
11
people on the China mainland and all other peo-
12
ples of the Western Pacific area’’; 
13
(B) ‘‘to declare that peace and stability in 
14
the area are in the political, security, and eco-
15
nomic interests of the United States, and are 
16
matters of international concern’’; 
17
(C) ‘‘to make clear that the United States 
18
decision to establish diplomatic relations with 
19
the People’s Republic of China rests upon the 
20
expectation that the future of Taiwan will be 
21
determined by peaceful means’’; 
22
(D) ‘‘to consider any effort to determine 
23
the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful 
24
means, including by boycotts or embargoes, a 
25

threat to the peace and security of the Western 
1
Pacific area and of grave concern to the United 
2
States’’; 
3
(E) ‘‘to provide Taiwan with arms of a de-
4
fensive character’’; and 
5
(F) ‘‘to maintain the capacity of the 
6
United States to resist any resort to force or 
7
other forms of coercion that would jeopardize 
8
the security, or the social or economic system, 
9
of the people on Taiwan’’. 
10
(4) Since the election of President Tsai Ing-wen 
11
as President of Taiwan in 2016, the Chinese Com-
12
munist Party has employed a variety of coercive 
13
military and nonmilitary tactics short of armed con-
14
flict in its efforts to exert existential pressure on 
15
Taiwan, including through diplomatic isolation, re-
16
stricting 
tourism, 
cyberattacks, 
spreading 
17
disinformation, and controlling the ability of Taiwan 
18
to purchase COVID–19 vaccines from other coun-
19
tries. 
20
(5) In 2021, there was a notable increase in 
21
military provocations by the People’s Liberation 
22
Army against Taiwan, including increased flights of 
23
military aircraft within Taiwan’s air defense identi-
24
fication zone, holding military exercises in the vicin-
25

•HR 6484 IH
ity of Taiwan’s controlled waters, and performing 
1
live-fire exercises in the South China Sea. 
2
(6) In March 2021, then Commander of the 
3
United States Indo-Pacific Command Admiral Philip 
4
Davidson testified that the threat of a military inva-
5
sion of Taiwan by the People’s Liberation Army ‘‘is 
6
manifest during this decade, in fact in the next six 
7
years’’. 
8
(7) In March 2021, then Commander of the 
9
United States Pacific Fleet Admiral John Aquilino 
10
testified that the threat of a military invasion by the 
11
People’s Liberation Army of Taiwan is ‘‘much closer 
12
to us than most think’’ and could materialize well 
13
before 2035. 
14
(8) In October 2021, President Joseph R. 
15
Biden publicly affirmed that the United States 
16
would come to the defense of Taiwan, saying, ‘‘yes, 
17
we have a commitment to do that’’. 
18
(9) In addition to military power, economic and 
19
financial instruments of United States power and 
20
their potential use can have an important deterrent 
21
effect on the actions of other countries.

•HR 6484 IH
(1) it is in the interests of the United States to 
1
maintain a free and open Indo-Pacific region, with 
2
peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait as a critical 
3
component; 
4
(2) efforts by the Chinese Communist Party to 
5
unilaterally determine the future of Taiwan through 
6
non-peaceful means, including threats and the direct 
7
use of force, military coercion, economic boycotts or 
8
embargoes, and efforts to internationally isolate or 
9
annex Taiwan— 
10
(A) directly undermine the spirit, intent, 
11
and purpose of the Taiwan Relations Act (22 
12
U.S.C. 3301 et seq.); 
13
(B) undermine peace and stability in the

16

(D) are of grave concern to the Govern-
18
ment of the United States; 
19
(3) the initiation of a military invasion of Tai-
20
wan by the People’s Liberation Army would—

(A) disrupt the peace and stability of the

23
the entire globe; and

(4) as an important deterrent measure against

a military invasion of Taiwan, the Chinese Com-

an invasion will result in catastrophic economic and
