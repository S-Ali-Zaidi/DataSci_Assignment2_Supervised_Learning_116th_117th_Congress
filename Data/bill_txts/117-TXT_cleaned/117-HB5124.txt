SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE. 
6
The Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Crisis in almost every sphere of life is now 
8
the standard and is exacerbated through inequalities 
9
in the spheres of race, sexuality, and gender. These 
10
stem from disparities in society that have grown ex-
11
ponentially over the last 40 years with the dramatic 
12
decline in manufacturing being a key contributing 
13
factor. 
14
(2) A manufacturing renaissance is at the heart 
15
of our ability to strategically and proactively address 
16
our intersecting crises of racism, climate change, 
17
and economic inequality. 
18
(3) Only a revitalized manufacturing sector can 
19
create the products, processes, and transition oppor-
20
tunities that are necessary to address the climate 
21

crisis, including the strategic development of domes-
1
tic supply chains that strengthen economic resilience 
2
to future economic and environmental shocks. Ex-
3
panding our advanced manufacturing sector is cen-
4
tral for the march to zero emissions and the de-car-
5
bonization of our society. 
6
(4) The goal of revitalization is not to return to 
7
the type of manufacturing sector we had in the past, 
8
where Black, Indigenous, and workers of color, as 
9
well as women, were last hired and first fired, and 
10
where workers and communities were excluded from 
11
the critical decisions in the productive process. 
12
(5) People who live, work, and play in Amer-
13
ica’s most polluted environments are commonly peo-
14
ple of color and the poor. Environmental justice ad-
15
vocates have shown that this is no accident. Commu-
16
nities of color, which are often also low-income, are 
17
routinely targeted to host facilities that have nega-
18
tive environmental impacts—say, a landfill, dirty in-
19
dustrial plant, or truck depot. The statistics provide 
20
clear evidence of what is commonly called ‘‘environ-
21
mental racism.’’ Communities of color have been 
22
battling this injustice for decades. If we are to truly 
23
to ‘‘Build Back Better’’ we must address this envi-
24
ronmental imbalance with a coherent, inclusive in-
25

dustrial policy, including providing funding for tran-
1
sitions for workers and for companies. 
2
(6) Embracing inclusion and empowerment of 
3
non-traditional manufacturing populations in all as-
4
pects of manufacturing is not only a competitive ad-
5
vantage, but a moral imperative.
