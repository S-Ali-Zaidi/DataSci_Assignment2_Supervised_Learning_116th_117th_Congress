•HR 2374 IH
(1) In 2016 and 2017, the Palestinian Author-
1
ity published modified curricula for school-aged chil-
2
dren in grades 1 through 11. 
3
(2) Textbooks used by the Palestinian Author-
4
ity (PA) in the West Bank and Gaza include graph-
5
ics portraying violence against Israeli soldiers, posi-
6
tive portrayals of individuals who have committed at-
7
tacks against citizens of Israel, and references to 
8
Palestinian efforts to target the ‘‘Zionists’’. 
9
(3) PA textbooks are used at schools sponsored 
10
by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency 
11
(UNRWA) because UNRWA schools use the text-
12
books of the host government. 
13

14
countability Office (GAO) published a report that 
15
found the following: 
16
(A) Textbooks in PA schools feature inac-
17
curate and misleading maps of the region and 
18
include militaristic, adversarial imagery and 
19
content that incite hatred. 
20
(B) The Department of State raised with 
21
Palestinian officials the objectionable content in 
22
textbooks, including a specific math problem

using the number of Palestinian casualties in 
24
the First and Second Intifadas.

(C) The United Nations Relief and Works 
1
Agency (UNRWA), in its review of the text-
2
books, identified content not aligned with

4
content related to neutrality or bias issues, in-
5
cluding issues related to maps and references to 
6
Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

It is the sense of Congress that the Palestinian Au-
9
thority has not sufficiently eliminated content and pas-
10
sages encouraging violence or intolerance toward other 
11
countries or ethnic groups from the curriculum used in 
12
their schools.
