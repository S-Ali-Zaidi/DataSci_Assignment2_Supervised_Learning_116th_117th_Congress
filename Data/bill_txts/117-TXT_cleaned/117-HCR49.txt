CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 
Censuring and condemning President Joseph R. Biden. 
Whereas it is the responsibility of the President, in his capac-
ity as Commander in Chief, to ensure the national secu-
rity of the United States of America and its citizens, at 
home and abroad; 
Whereas the Taliban, a fundamentalist Islamic group, con-
trolled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001, over which period 
it established Sharia law and provided safe harbor to 
members of the al-Qaida terrorist organization, who used 
Afghanistan as a base of operations to plan the Sep-
tember 11, 2001, attack on the United States, which re-
sulted in the death of over 3,000 Americans;

Whereas the Biden administration had sufficient warning 
that the withdrawal of United States forces from Afghan-
istan could precipitate Taliban control of Afghanistan, 
according to— 
(1) a State Department document signed on July 
13, 2021, by 23 staff members of the United States em-
bassy in Afghanistan, warning the Biden administration 
of the potential collapse of the Afghan capital of Kabul 
soon after the President’s withdrawal deadline; and 
(2) comments from the Chairman of the House Per-
manent Select Committee on Intelligence made on Au-
gust 23, 2021, following a classified briefing, stating that 
‘‘there were any number of warnings that the Taliban 
might take over, and some that included a potential of 
a very rapid takeover.’’; 
Whereas despite sufficient warning, the Biden administration 
proceeded with a haphazard military withdrawal that di-
rectly resulted in the Taliban regaining full control of Af-
ghanistan in only 9 days, beginning with the initial sei-
zure of the province of Nimroz on August 6, 2021, and 
concluding with the capture of the Afghan capital of 
Kabul on August 15, 2021; 
Whereas through the course and nature of the withdrawal of 
United States military forces from Afghanistan, and the 
resulting rapid takeover of Afghanistan by the Taliban, 
the Biden administration has compromised the physical 
security of tens of thousands of United States military 
personnel, United States Government operatives, United 
States civilians, Afghan allies, other international allies, 
and billions of dollars of advanced United States military 
equipment;

Whereas, on August 26, 2021, the terrorist organization 
ISIS–K executed a series of suicide bombing attacks 
against United States military forces conducting emer-
gency evacuation operations at the Kabul airport, which 
attacks resulted in the deaths of 13 United States service 
members, the injury of an additional 18 United States 
service members, and the deaths of 60 Afghans, including 
children; 
Whereas these events have substantively diminished the na-
tional security of the United States of America and its 
citizens, both at home and abroad; 
Whereas these events have likewise substantively diminished 
the international reputation of the United States, which 
further limits the United States ability to ensure its na-
tional security; and 
Whereas the aforementioned executive military decisions and 
resulting consequences constitute a failure to meet ac-
ceptable standards of behavior relating to the national se-
curity responsibilities of the Commander in Chief, and it 
is the responsibility of the Congress to reprimand such 
failure through censure: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate 
1
concurring), That Congress does hereby condemn and cen-
2
sure President Joseph R. Biden for the decision to execute 
3
a haphazard military withdrawal from Afghanistan, de-
4
spite sufficient warning as to the probable and deleterious 
5
consequences that this decision would have on the national 
6
security of the United States and its citizens, which deci-
7
sion constitutes a failure to meet acceptable standards of
