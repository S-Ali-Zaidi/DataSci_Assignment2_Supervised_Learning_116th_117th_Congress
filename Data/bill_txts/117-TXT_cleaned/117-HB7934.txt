(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:

•HR 7934 IH
(1) Energy independence and security are crit-
1
ical for a country to maintain its sovereignty and 
2
independence. 
3
(2) The International Energy Agency (‘‘IEA’’) 
4
defines energy security as the uninterrupted avail-
5
ability of energy sources at an affordable price. 
6
(3) The IEA defines long-term energy security 
7
as primarily dealing with timely investments to sup-
8
ply energy in line with economic developments and 
9
environmental needs. 
10
(4) The IEA defines short-term energy security 
11
as focusing on the ability of a country’s energy sys-
12
tem to react promptly to sudden changes in the sup-
13
ply-demand balance. 
14
(5) The IEA found in February 2022 that Rus-
15
sia’s unlawful invasion of Ukraine poses serious im-
16
plications for international energy security. 
17
(6) The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
18
Change (IPCC), a United Nations body that pro-
19
vides regular assessments on climate change, issued 
20
its sixth report in February 2022, and found that 
21
‘‘human-induced climate change, including more fre-
22
quent and intense extreme events, has caused wide-
23
spread adverse impacts and related losses and dam-

ages to nature and people, beyond natural climate 
1
variability’’. 
2
(7) The IPCC notes that to avoid mounting loss 
3
of life, biodiversity, and infrastructure, we must have 
4
ambitious, accelerated action to adapt to climate 
5
change, while also making rapid, deep cuts in green-
6
house gas emissions. 
7
(8) The World Meteorological Organization’s 
8
State of the Climate in Latin America and the Car-
9
ibbean 2020 report found that— 
10
(A) widespread drought across Latin 
11
America and the Caribbean has had significant 
12
impact on inland shipping routes, crop yields, 
13
and food production, and consequently led to 
14
worsening food insecurity; 
15
(B) extreme weather events affected more 
16
than 8 million people across Central America, 
17
exacerbating food insecurity in countries al-
18
ready crippled by economic shocks, COVID–19 
19
impacts, and conflict; and 
20
(C) sea-level rise poses a major risk to low- 
21
lying coastal zones in the Latin America and 
22
the Caribbean. 
23
(9) Rising commodity and energy prices, as well 
24
as other global economic shocks such as those 
25

caused by natural disasters, pandemics, and conflict, 
1
pose a serious food security risk that may lead to so-
2
cial unrest and instability in Latin America and the 
3
Caribbean. 
4
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
5
gress that the United States has economic and national 
6
security interests in assisting Latin America and the Car-
7
ibbean to achieve energy security. 
8
(c) STATEMENT OF POLICY.— It is the policy of the 
9
United States— 
10
(1) to advance United States foreign policy and 
11
development goals by helping Latin America and the 
12
Caribbean meet its short-term energy needs; 
13
(2) to promote the energy security of Latin 
14
America and the Caribbean by encouraging the de-
15
velopment of accessible, transparent, and competitive 
16
energy markets that provide diversified sources, 
17
types, and routes of energy, prioritizing renewable 
18
energy practices that address challenges posed by 
19
climate change; 
20
(3) to encourage United States public and pri-
21
vate sector investment in Latin American and Carib-
22
bean energy infrastructure projects to bridge the gap 
23
between energy security requirements and commer-
24
cial demand in a way that is consistent with the re-

gion’s absorptive capacity, and that recognizes the 
1
importance of building and widening the absorptive 
2
capacity of the region; and 
3
(4) to help facilitate the export of United States 
4
energy resources, technology, and expertise to global 
5
markets in a way that benefits the energy security

of Latin America and the Caribbean.
