SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Recent research has demonstrated that—

2 
•HR 1345 IH
(A) new businesses (commonly referred to 
1
as ‘‘startups’’)— 
2
(i) are disproportionately responsible 
3
for the innovations that drive economic 
4
growth; and 
5
(ii) account for virtually all net new 
6
job creation; 
7
(B) the rate of formation of United States 
8
businesses has fallen significantly in recent 
9
years; and 
10
(C) as determined by widely cited research, 
11
the decline in the rate described in subpara-
12
graph (B) is occurring in all 50 States, in all 
13
but a handful of 360 metro areas examined, 
14
and across a broad range of industry sectors. 
15
(2) Before policymakers can identify ways in 
16
which the decline in the rate described in paragraph 
17
(1)(B) may be counteracted, the underlying causes 
18
of the decline must be identified. 
19
(3) Economists have identified several factors 
20
that may explain the decline in the rate described in 
21
paragraph (1)(B), including— 
22
(A) demographic changes caused by an 
23
aging workforce and slowing population growth; 
24
01:56 Mar 22, 2021
H1345

•HR 1345 IH
(B) increased industry concentration that 
1
may make it more difficult for new market en-
2
trants to compete with established companies; 
3
(C) increased risk-aversion following the fi-
4
nancial crisis and recession that occurred in 
5
2008 and 2009 and deterioration of household 
6
balance sheets; 
7
(D) difficulties relating to access to cap-
8
ital, particularly difficulties encountered by un-
9
derserved populations, women, and members of 
10
minority groups; 
11
(E) the concentration of venture capital in 
12
only a few cities; 
13
(F) record levels of student debt; and 
14
(G) inefficiencies or other difficulties relat-
15
ing to the commercialization of federally funded 
16
research and innovation.
