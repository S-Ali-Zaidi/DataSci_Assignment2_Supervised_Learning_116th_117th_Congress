SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
The Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Iran is characterized by high levels of offi-
8
cial and institutional corruption, and substantial in-
9
volvement by Iran’s security forces, particularly the

Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), in the 
1
economy. 
2
(2) In 2019, the Department of the Treasury 
3
concluded that Iran is a jurisdiction of primary 
4
money laundering concern and imposed restrictions 
5
on correspondent accounts in the United States in-
6
volving Iranian financial institutions. 
7
(3) In June 2019, the Financial Action Task 
8
Force (FATF) urged all jurisdictions to require in-
9
creased supervisory examination for branches and 
10
subsidiaries of financial institutions based in Iran. 
11
The FATF later called upon its members to intro-
12
duce enhanced relevant reporting mechanisms or 
13
systematic reporting of financial transactions, and 
14
require increased external audit requirements, for fi-
15
nancial groups with respect to any of their branches 
16
and subsidiaries located in Iran. 
17
(4) The Transparency International index of 
18
perceived public corruption ranks Iran 138th out of 
19
180 countries surveyed. 
20
(5) According to the State Department’s 
21
‘‘Country Reports on Terrorism’’ in 2018, ‘‘Iran re-
22
mains the world’s worst state sponsor of terrorism. 
23
The regime has spent nearly one billion dollars per 
24
year to support terrorist groups that serve as its

groups such as Hizballah, Hamas, and Palestinian
