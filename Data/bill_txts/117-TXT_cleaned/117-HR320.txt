RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the critical importance of access to reliable, 
clean drinking water for Native Americans and Alaska 
Natives and confirming the responsibility of the Federal 
Government to ensure such water access. 
Whereas access to reliable, clean drinking water is an essen-
tial human need that is critical to the public health, well- 
being, educational attainment, and economic development 
of all communities in the United States; 
Whereas many countries, along with the United Nations, 
have recognized the urgency of water access by passing 
laws or resolutions regarding the human right to water, 
including recognition of these needs among indigenous

peoples and establishing aggressive targets for achieving 
universal access to this basic service; 
Whereas access to reliable, clean drinking water has long 
been a significant problem in many Tribal communities 
and in many Alaska Native Villages, such that nearly 
half of all Native American households still do not have 
access to reliable water sources, clean drinking water, 
and are significantly more likely than White households 
to lack indoor plumbing; 
Whereas reliable, clean drinking water may be unavailable to 
these households for a number of reasons, including be-
cause— 
(1) there is no piped water system connecting to the 
house; 
(2) the water available to the household does not 
meet minimum protective standards; 
(3) the water infrastructure is deteriorating or insuf-
ficient; or 
(4) Indian Tribes face challenges in supporting the 
operation and maintenance needs of existing water infra-
structure; 
Whereas Federal programs administered through the Indian 
Health Service of the Department of Health and Human 
Services, the Environmental Protection Agency, the De-
partment of Agriculture, and other Federal and State 
agencies have been unsuccessful in developing the infra-
structure necessary to provide reliable, clean drinking 
water for some Tribal communities; 
Whereas many Indian Tribes have significant unresolved 
claims for federally reserved water rights, many of which 
have been unresolved for decades and which may not be 
resolved for many years to come, due in part to the com-

plex and significant issues typically involved in water 
rights adjudication and settlements; 
Whereas the development of water infrastructure in Tribal 
communities has frequently been conditioned on the set-
tlement of such Tribal reserved water rights, and has 
been prevented or delayed by continuing uncertainty over 
the status of Tribal water rights, by the years-long proc-
ess of Tribal water rights settlements, or by continued 
conflict over the quantification of Tribal reserved water 
rights in State water rights adjudications; 
Whereas the quantity of water that would be required to sup-
ply reliable, clean drinking water to provide for the basic 
needs of the residents of Tribal communities and in Alas-
ka Native Villages are typically only a small fraction of 
the total quantity of Tribal reserved water rights; 
Whereas the Federal trust responsibility of the United States 
Government to Tribal nations requires the Federal Gov-
ernment to ensure the survival and welfare of Indian 
Tribes and people, and the failure to provide basic water 
service cannot be reconciled with this Federal trust re-
sponsibility; 
Whereas the Indian Self-Determination and Education As-
sistance Act (25 U.S.C. 5301 et seq.) affirmed the trust 
responsibility of the Federal Government to support Trib-
al self-governance and self-determination, and these goals 
cannot be fully realized without addressing inequities 
such as ensuring access to reliable, clean drinking water 
for every Tribal community; 
Whereas the ongoing COVID–19 pandemic has had a dis-
proportionate impact on Native Americans due to factors 
including persistent economic disadvantages in Tribal

communities and in Alaska Native Villages, racial in-
equity, lack of access to adequate health care, and lack 
of public health infrastructure, including access to run-
ning water; and 
Whereas the COVID–19 pandemic has provided a stark re-
minder that access to reliable, clean drinking water to 
support basic hygiene is a matter of life or death for all 
citizens of the United States: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That—

(1) it is the sense of the House of Representa-

(A) access to reliable, clean drinking water

in Tribal communities and in Alaska Native

to the health, well-being, and economic develop-

in such villages, and is integral to maintaining

the public health of the entire United States; 
10
(B) settlement or adjudication of Tribal 
11
claims of reserved water rights is not and 
12
should not be a prerequisite to the provision of 
13
this basic human service to households located 
14
in Tribal communities and in Alaska Native

human services be used to leverage the resolu-
