RESOLUTION 
Supporting the designation of October 23, 2021, as ‘‘AADC 
Deficiency Awareness Day’’. 
Whereas a rare disease is a disease or disorder that affects 
a small number of patients, currently defined as a condi-
tion that affects fewer than 200,000 people in the United 
States at any given time; 
Whereas there are more than 7,000 rare diseases that alto-
gether affect an estimated 25,000,000 to 30,000,000 
Americans; 
Whereas children make up more than half of the estimated 
25,000,000 to 30,000,000 Americans living with a rare 
disease; 
Whereas Aromatic L-Amino Acid Decarboxylase (AADC) De-
ficiency is a genetic neurologic rare disease that severely

debilitates a patient’s development, motor skills, growth, 
and cognitive and language skills and limits a patient’s 
life; 
Whereas AADC Deficiency results from an inherited genetic 
disease where patients lack the AADC enzyme required 
to create dopamine and, without dopamine, patients will 
never achieve motor milestones, such as holding their 
heads up, sitting, and standing, or develop the ability to 
communicate or perform basic life functions; 
Whereas patients are diagnosed with AADC Deficiency 
through genetic and other biochemical tests; 
Whereas patients suffering from AADC Deficiency often have 
unexplained low muscle tone and experience other symp-
toms like developmental delays and involuntary eye move-
ments; 
Whereas AADC Deficiency affects approximately 1 in 
100,000 people in the United States; 
Whereas AADC Deficiency is often mistaken for other dis-
eases like cerebral palsy, epilepsy, or even autism; 
Whereas Congress can raise awareness of AADC Deficiency 
in the public and medical community in the United 
States; 
Whereas awareness of AADC Deficiency will help patients 
who may be experiencing the symptoms of AADC Defi-
ciency recognize such disease and pursue appropriate 
treatment; and 
Whereas improved awareness and education around AADC 
Deficiency will increase medical representation for indi-
viduals suffering from AADC Deficiency: Now, therefore, 
be it
