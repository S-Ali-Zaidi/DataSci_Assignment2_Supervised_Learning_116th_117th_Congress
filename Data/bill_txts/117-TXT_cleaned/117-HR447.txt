RESOLUTION 
Supporting the designation of May 28, 2021, as ‘‘National 
Food Allergy Prevention Awareness Day’’ to raise aware-
ness and encourage the prevention of severe food aller-
gies among children. 
Whereas 32,000,000 Americans live with food allergies, in-
cluding many that are life-threatening, and the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention reports that the prev-
alence of food allergies in children increased by 50 per-
cent between 1997 and 2011; 
Whereas food allergies have an enormous impact on quality 
of life for the 1 in 13 children who develop a severe food 
allergy, and one-third of children over the age of 5 with 
allergies are bullied for their allergy;

Whereas there is an annual cost to families in the United 
States of nearly $25,000,000,000 per year, not including 
the impact to quality of life; 
Whereas many children who develop a food allergy do not 
have a family history of food allergies, and therefore the 
family is much less aware of the life-changing con-
sequences of developing a food allergy and the need for 
food allergy prevention; 
Whereas research has shown that early introduction has 
shown promise in reducing the impact of food allergies in 
studies where parents feed peanuts and eggs, allergenic 
foods, to their babies as early as 4 to 6 months of age; 
Whereas the 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 
published by the Department of Agriculture and the De-
partment of Health and Human Services, and medical 
guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics and 
the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases 
already recommend early allergen introduction to help 
prevent food allergies; and 
Whereas the FASTER Act of 2021 (Public Law 117–11) 
highlights sesame as an important allergenic food, and 
prioritizes food allergy research opportunities to examine 
prevention and develop more effective treatment, and ul-
timately, a cure: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—

(1) supports the designation of ‘‘National Food
