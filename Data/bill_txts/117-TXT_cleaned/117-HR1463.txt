RESOLUTION 
Supporting the goals and ideals of ‘‘move over’’ laws. 
Whereas the House of Representatives recognizes law en-
forcement, fire and rescue, emergency medical services, 
tow truck operators, and transportation workers as traf-
fic incident management responders (as such term is de-
fined by the Traffic Incident Management Handbook of 
the Federal Highway Administration); 
Whereas due to the increasingly high rate of drivers engaging 
in risky behaviors on our roadways, including distracted 
driving, impaired driving, and speeding, many traffic inci-
dent management responders lose their lives while per-
forming their duties each year; 
Whereas, nationally in 2021, 65 traffic incident management 
responders were killed due to roadside collisions;

Whereas every State has a ‘‘move over’’ law, which has cor-
related directly to a safer environment along our Nation’s 
roadsides for traffic incident management responders and 
stranded citizens; 
Whereas ‘‘move over’’ laws generally require motorists to 
move at least 1 lane over when there is an emergency or 
rescue activity taking place on the shoulder or side of the 
roadway, or, if unable to do so safely, to slow down and 
pass the scene with caution; 
Whereas a Government Accountability Office report (GAO– 
21–166) on Emergency Responder Safety noted that 
State officials cite raising public awareness as the most 
prevalent challenge to ‘‘move over’’ laws; and 
Whereas providing traffic incident management responders 
an enhanced opportunity to inform the motoring public 
about these laws is critical to the public safety: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the goals and ideals of ‘‘move
