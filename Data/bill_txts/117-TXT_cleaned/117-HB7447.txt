To direct the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration to conduct a study on the mod-
ernization of aeronautical standards, and for other pur-
poses. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Modernizing Aero-

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:

•HR 7447 IH
(1) The work of the U.S. Committee on Exten-
1
sion to the Standard Atmosphere, established in 
2
1953, led to the 1958, 1962, 1966, and 1976 
3
versions of the U.S. Standard Atmosphere. 
4
(2) These models were published in book form 
5
jointly by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Ad-
6
ministration, the National Aeronautics and Space 
7
Administration, and the U.S. Air Force. 
8
(3) The U.S. Standard Atmosphere is widely 
9
used as a basis for the design, testing, and operation 
10
of aircraft and other equipment. 
11
(4) The Department of Defense has supple-
12
mented the standard atmosphere with data models 
13
of climatic extremes, most recently with MIL– 
14
HDBK–310, Climatic Information to Determine De-
15
sign and Test Requirements for Military Systems 
16
and Equipment, which was published in 1997 and 
17
‘‘provides climatic data primarily for use in engi-
18
neering analyses to develop and test military equip-
19
ment and materiel’’. 
20
(5) The most recent standard atmosphere pub-
21
lished in 1976 assumed a standard sea-level tem-
22
perature of 59 degrees Fahrenheit in continuation of 
23
the assumption established in 1924 by Resolution 
24

•HR 7447 IH
192 of the International Commission for Air Naviga-
1
tion. 
2
(6) Between 1924 and 1976, the average global 
3
sea-level temperature rose by 0.5 degree Fahrenheit. 
4
(7) Since 1976, the average global sea-level 
5
temperature has risen by more than 1.5 degrees 
6
Fahrenheit, the five warmest years in the modern 
7
record have all occurred since 2015, and nine of the 
8
10 warmest years have occurred since 2005. 
9
(8) Under the Fifth Assessment Report of the 
10
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (AR5 
11
IPCC), all scenarios considered result in an average 
12
global temperature rise in 2040 by more than 2.5 
13
degrees Fahrenheit since 1976, with the most ex-
14
treme scenario resulting in a temperature rise of 3.5 
15
degrees Fahrenheit. 
16
(9) By 2100, the IPCC projects that the global 
17
mean temperature will increase by more than 4 de-
18
grees Fahrenheit under moderate scenarios, with the 
19
potential to exceed 7.5 degrees Fahrenheit under the 
20
most extreme scenarios. 
21
(10) Aircraft performance is negatively affected 
22
by increased temperatures, resulting in lower pay-
23
load capacity, increased runway requirements, re-
24

duced range, slower climb out speeds, and negative 
1
impacts to environmental performance. 
2
(11) For existing aircraft and engine designs, 
3
the increase to ambient temperature will result in 
4
impacts to operations to account for the lower en-
5
gine and aircraft performance, which may include in-
6
creased noise exposure, increased operations, in-
7
crease to emissions, and degradation of air quality. 
8
(12) For new aircraft and engine designs, the 
9
increase to ambient temperature will require im-
10
proved engine designs that provide required thrust 
11
at higher ambient temperatures to meet mission re-
12
quirements, which may result in de-rating at air-
13
ports with excess runway length, resulting in lower 
14
operational noise compared to current levels. 
15
(13) The military and commercial aircraft being 
16
designed today are expected to be in operation for 
17
thirty to fifty years, with an expected end of life be-
18
tween 2050 to 2070.
