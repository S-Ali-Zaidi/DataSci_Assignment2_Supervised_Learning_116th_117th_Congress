Whereas polls show that Americans overwhelmingly support 
Israel, a liberal democracy in a sea of authoritarianism; 
Whereas, even though most Americans stand against anti- 
Semitism, there are a troubling amount in our country 
who stubbornly cling to anti-Semitic views; 
Whereas the United States recognizes a long history of anti- 
Semitism throughout history; 
Whereas evil people try to cloak anti-Semitism in criticism of 
the Israeli government; 
Whereas there is an unacceptable number of hate crimes in 
the United States, mostly perpetrated against Jews; 
Whereas the political temperature must be lowered and in-
citement must be addressed, rebuked, and rebutted; 
Whereas the United States has a foreign policy interest in 
fighting anti-Semitism; 
Whereas anti-Semitism charges Jews with omnimalevolence; 
Whereas anti-Semitism asserts that Jews control the govern-
ment and all culture, forming a ruling class that dis-
enfranchises the common man; 
Whereas anti-Semitism directs dual loyalty charges towards 
Jews of differing nations; 
Whereas anti-Semitism regards Jews around the world as 
representatives for the nation of Israel and justifies at-
tacking them as proto-military target; 
Whereas over the last month the United States has experi-
enced bicoastal evidence of violent anti-Semitism; 
Whereas many of these attacks occurred during ‘‘Jewish 
American Heritage Month’’ a troubling sign of increased 
boldness in the minds of bigots; and
