A BILL 
To amend the Public Health Service Act to sustain senior 
congregate care operations in the wake of ongoing 
COVID–19 financial burdens, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Safeguarding Elderly

5
of 2022’’ or the ‘‘SENIOR Act of 2022’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
7
The Congress finds as follows:

17:15 Feb 01, 2022

•HR 6530 IH
(1) Long-term care facilities and senior con-
1
gregate care homes provide direct and personalized 
2
care, where social distancing is not possible, 24 
3
hours a day, 7 days a week. 
4
(2) Assisted living, memory care, independent 
5
living, and other senior congregate care settings are 
6
the homes of America’s seniors and critical options 
7
on the long-term care continuum; these senior resi-
8
dences provide safety and security for our Nation’s 
9
most vulnerable population. 
10
(3) Sixty percent of a senior’s health is based 
11
on social determinants of health which include the 
12
need for adequate nutrition, housing, and social ac-
13
tivities; thus supporting caregivers and home- and 
14
community-based care models that prioritize the so-
15
cial determinants of senior health should be a pri-
16
ority of the Congress. 
17
(4) Investing in senior care and the caregiving 
18
workforce prevents hospitalization and skilled nurs-
19
ing expenses, preserving Medicare and Medicaid 
20
budgets. 
21
(5) Since March of 2020, senior care facilities 
22
have lost over 380,000 caregivers and are experi-
23
encing a workforce crisis as America’s population 
24
rapidly ages.

•HR 6530 IH
(6) By 2030, the entire Baby Boomer Genera-
1
tion will be 65 years of age or older. 
2
(7) By 2060, nearly 95 million Americans will 
3
be 65 years of age or older and the portion of the 
4
population over 85 years of age will have tripled to 
5
nearly 20 million persons. 
6
(8) Fifty-two percent of individuals require 
7
long-term care by age 65. Individuals over 65 years 
8
of age are 70 percent more likely to need long-term 
9
care, with half of those seniors requiring an even 
10
higher level of care. 
11
(9) The average duration of long-term care is 
12
nearly 4 years, and 14 percent of individuals need 
13
long-term care for 5 or more years. 
14
(10) Twenty-seven percent of seniors over 65 
15
years of age will spend at least $100,000 on long- 
16
term care, and 15 percent will have costs for long- 
17
term care surpassing $250,000. 
18
(11) The average cost for long-term care for a 
19
65-year old today is $138,000. 
20
(12) Long-term care infrastructure must ad-
21
dress the availability of cost-effective care and hous-
22
ing options to meet the growing needs of the Na-
23
tion’s aging population. 
24

•HR 6530 IH
(13) On average, assisted living costs $4,300 
1
per month, which equals $5.91 per hour of available 
2
care (based on 24/7 care). Nursing homes cost 
3
$8,821 per month (or $13.13 per hour based on 24/ 
4
7 care). In-home care costs $4,576 per month (or 
5
$26 per hour based on 44 hours per week care). 
6
(14) An individual 85 years of age or older is 
7
630 percent more likely to die of COVID–19. 
8
(15) Sixty-three percent of residents of long- 
9
term care facilities need assistance with bathing; 48 
10
percent need assistance with dressing; and 40 per-
11
cent need assistance with toileting. 
12
(16) More than 42 percent of residents of long- 
13
term care facilities suffer from Alzheimer’s disease 
14
or some other form of dementia. 
15
(17) The people of the United States are a 
16
compassionate people who are committed to pro-
17
tecting the most vulnerable in our society, and we 
18
should not jeopardize the financial underpinnings of 
19
the long-term care communities our Nation’s senior 
20
citizens depend on day-in and day-out.
