SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) NIST’s work in identity research and stand-
3
ards is unmatched anywhere in the world, with glob-
4
al standards development organizations like the Fi-
5
nancial Action Task Force (FATF) pointing to 
6
NIST guidance in its own standards. Given that ad-
7
versaries continue to exploit weaknesses in digital 
8
identity systems to conduct successful cyber-attacks, 
9
additional NIST resources are needed to help gov-
10
ernment and industry secure identity in cyberspace. 
11
(2) The lack of an easy, affordable, and reliable 
12
way for organizations and businesses to identify 
13
whether an individual is who they claim to be online 
14
creates an attack vector that is widely exploited by 
15
adversaries in cyberspace and precludes many high 
16
value transactions from being available online. 
17
(3) According to the identity theft resource cen-
18
ter, incidents of identity theft and identity fraud 
19
continue to rise in the United States, where more 
20
than 164,000,000 consumer records containing per-
21
sonally identifiable information were breached in 
22
2019, increasing the total number of data breaches 
23
by 17 percent from the previous year.

(4) According to the Insurance Information In-
1
stitute, in 2018, losses resulting from identity fraud 
2
amounted to $16,800,000,000. 
3
(5) The inadequacy of current digital identity 
4
solutions degrades security and privacy for all Amer-
5
icans, and next generation solutions are needed that 
6
improve both security and privacy. 
7
(6) 
Government 
entities, 
as 
authoritative 
8
issuers of identity in the United States, are uniquely 
9
positioned to deliver critical components that ad-
10
dress deficiencies in our digital identity infrastruc-
11
ture and augment private sector digital identity and 
12
authentication solutions. 
13
(7) State governments are particularly well 
14
suited to play a role in enhancing digital identity so-
15
lutions used by both the public and private sectors, 
16
given the role of State governments as the issuers of 
17
driver’s licenses and other identity documents com-
18
monly used today. 
19
(8) It should be the policy of the Government 
20
to use the authorities and capabilities of the Govern-
21
ment to enhance the security, reliability, privacy, 
22
and convenience of digital identity solutions that 
23
support and protect transactions between individ-
