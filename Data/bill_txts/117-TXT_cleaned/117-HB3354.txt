SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS; FINDINGS. 
1
(a) SHORT TITLE.—This Act may be cited as the 
2
‘‘Concentrating on High-value Alzheimer’s Needs to Get 
3
to an End Act of 2021’’ or the ‘‘CHANGE Act of 2021’’. 
4
(b) TABLE OF CONTENTS.—The table of contents of 
5
this Act is as follows: 
6
Sec. 1. Short title; table of contents; findings. 
Sec. 2. Cognitive impairment detection benefit in the Medicare annual wellness 
visit and initial preventive physical examination. 
Sec. 3. Medicare quality payment program. 
Sec. 4. Report to Congress on implementation of this Act. 
Sec. 5. Study and report on regulatory and legislative changes or refinements 
that would accelerate Alzheimer’s disease research progress. 
(c) FINDINGS.—Congress finds as follows: 
7
(1) It is estimated that 6.2 million Americans 
8
age 65 and older are living with Alzheimer’s disease 
9
in 2021. More than one in nine people age 65 and 
10
older has Alzheimer’s. By 2050, the number of 
11
Americans age 65 and older with Alzheimer’s de-
12
mentia is projected to reach 12.7 million. 
13
(2) Alzheimer’s disease disproportionately im-
14
pacts women and people of color. 
15
(3) Almost two-thirds of Americans with Alz-
16
heimer’s disease are women. 
17
(4) According to the Centers for Disease Con-
18
trol and Prevention, among people ages 65 and 
19
older, African Americans have the highest prevalence 
20
of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (13.8 
21
percent), followed by Hispanics (12.2 percent), and 
22

•HR 3354 IH
non-Hispanic Whites (10.3 percent), American In-
1
dian and Alaska Natives (9.1 percent), and Asian 
2
and Pacific Islanders (8.4 percent). This higher 
3
prevalence translates into a higher death rate: Alz-
4
heimer’s deaths increased 55 percent among all 
5
Americans between 1999 and 2014, while the num-
6
ber was 107 percent for Latinos and 99 percent for 
7
African Americans. 
8
(5) Currently available data shows that about 
9
half of individuals age 65 and older with mild cog-
10
nitive impairment (MCI)—roughly 5 million Ameri-
11
cans—have MCI due to Alzheimer’s disease. Ap-
12
proximately 15 percent of individuals with MCI de-
13
velop dementia after two years and 32 percent de-
14
velop Alzheimer’s dementia within five years’ follow- 
15
up. 
16
(6) Addressing modifiable risk factors such as 
17
physical activity, smoking, education, staying socially 
18
and mentally active, blood pressure, and diet might 
19
prevent or delay up to 40 percent of dementia cases. 
20
(7) An early, documented diagnosis, commu-
21
nicated to the patient and caregiver, enables early 
22
access to care planning services and available med-
23
ical and nonmedical treatments, and optimizes pa-
24

tients’ ability to build a care team, participate in 
1
support services, and enroll in clinical trials. 
2
(8) Alzheimer’s exacts an emotional and phys-
3
ical toll on caregivers, resulting in higher incidence 
4
of heart disease, cancer, depression, and other health 
5
consequences. 
6
(9) More than 11 million Americans provide un-
7
paid care for people with Alzheimer’s or other de-
8
mentia and provided nearly $257 billion in unpaid 
9
care to people living with Alzheimer’s and other de-
10
mentias in 2020. 
11
(10) In 2021, it is estimated that Alzheimer’s 
12
and related dementias will have cost Medicare and 
13
Medicaid programs $239 billion. By 2050, it is esti-
14
mated that these direct costs will increase to as 
15
much as $1.1 trillion.
