‘‘(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
2
‘‘(1) Since the initial establishment of the Na-
3
tional Mesonet Program, a public-private partner-
4
ship program, the Program has leveraged data col-
5
lected by existing weather observation networks to— 
6
‘‘(A) provide accurate, real-time observa-
7
tions to support weather forecasters, emergency 
8
response, and all-weather sensitive activities 
9
across the United States; 
10
‘‘(B) address persistent impediments, iden-
11
tified in a 2009 National Academy of Sciences 
12
Report, From the Ground Up, to fulfill the 
13
need for broader and denser environmental ob-
14
servation networks to improve severe weather 
15
lead-times; 
16
‘‘(C) help achieve major improvements for 
17
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Admin-
18
istration and the broader American Weather 
19
Enterprise, as identified in the 2011 National 
20

‘‘(E) improve understanding of the impact, 
1
size, and duration of mesoscale weather events. 
2
‘‘(2) The National Mesonet Program is a crit-
3
ical component of Administration operations and 
4
provides reliable, real-time observation capabilities 
5
for the physical environment that enhances pre-
6
diction, preparedness, and response strategies to se-
7
vere weather events.

‘‘(3) The National Mesonet Program is a pri-
9
mary input, ingest, and quality-assurance/quality-

11
ical to operations, including situational awareness,

‘‘(b) PROGRAM.—There is in the National Weather 
17
Service a program to be known as the National Mesonet 
18
Program (in this section referred to as the ‘Program’).

The Program shall— 
20
‘‘(1) be administered by the Under Secretary;

1
available commercial, academic, and other non-Fed-
2
eral weather data to enhance coordination across the 
3
private, public, and academic sectors of the United 
4
States weather enterprise. 
5
‘‘(c) PROGRAM
ELEMENTS.—The Program shall 
6
carry out the following activities: 
7
‘‘(1) Improve environmental observations used 
8
by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminis-
9
tration and the National Weather Service to support 
10
baseline forecasts and warnings that protect the Na-
11
tion’s citizens, businesses, military, and government 
12
agencies and enable such individuals and entities to 
13
operate in safe, efficient, and orderly manners. 
14
‘‘(2) When demonstrably cost effective, leverage 
15
existing networks of environmental monitoring sta-
16
tions to increase the quantity and density of weather 
17
observations available to the Administration. 
18
‘‘(3) Establish means to integrate greater den-
19
sity and type of weather observations into the Pro-
20
gram on an annual basis, including by encouraging 
21
local and regional networks of environmental moni-
22
toring stations to participate in the Program. 
23
‘‘(4) Yield increased quantities of boundary- 
24
layer data to improve numerical weather prediction

‘‘(5) Provide the critical technical and adminis-
3
trative infrastructure needed to facilitate rapid inte-
4
gration and sustained use of new and emerging net-
5
works of environmental monitoring stations antici-
6
pated in coming years. 
7
‘‘(6) Expand and enhance environmental obser-
8
vational networks in the roadway environment to 
9
provide real-time road weather and surface condi-
10
tions for surface transportation and related eco-
11
nomic sectors.

‘‘(7) Identify available terrestrial or marine 
13
weather data, or quantifiable gaps in such data, to 
14
improve the understanding of air-sea interactions.

‘‘(8) Support the National Weather Service in 
16
reaching its target of a 30-minute warning time for 
17
severe weather through better predictive model algo-
18
rithms driven by increasingly effective observations.

‘‘(9) Coordinate with existing Administration 
20
data used for forecasts, including data from the Na-
21
tional Environmental Satellite, Data, and Informa-
22
