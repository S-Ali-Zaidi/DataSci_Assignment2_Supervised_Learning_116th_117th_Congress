Paragraph (4) of section 111(a) of the Clean Air Act 
5
(42 U.S.C. 7411(a)) is amended—

(1) by inserting ‘‘(A)’’ before ‘‘The term’’; 
7
(2) by inserting before the period at the end the 
8
following: ‘‘. For purposes of the preceding sentence, 
9
a change increases the amount of any air pollutant 
10
emitted by such source only if the maximum hourly 
11
emission rate of an air pollutant that is achievable 
12
by such source after the change is higher than the 
13
maximum hourly emission rate of such air pollutant 
14
that was achievable by such source during any hour 
15
in the 10-year period immediately preceding the

change’’; and 
17
(3) by adding at the end the following: 
18
‘‘(B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the 
19
term ‘modification’ does not include a change at a

22

the change would be a modification as defined in
