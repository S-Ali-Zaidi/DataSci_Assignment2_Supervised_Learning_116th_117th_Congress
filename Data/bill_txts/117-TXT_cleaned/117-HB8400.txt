(a) RADAR OBSTRUCTION RESEARCH.—Title IV of 
3
the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act of 
4
2017 (15 U.S.C. 8514 et seq.) is amended by adding at 
5
the end the following new section: 
6
‘‘SEC. 415. RADAR OBSTRUCTION RESEARCH, DEVELOP-
7
MENT, TEST, AND EVALUATION PROGRAM. 
8
‘‘(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—The Director of the Na-
9
tional Weather Service, in coordination with the Assistant 
10
Administrator for Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, 
11
shall establish a Research, Development, Test, and Eval-
12
uation Program (in this section referred to as the ‘Pro-
13
gram’) to ensure the continued performance of weather 
14
radar detection and prediction capabilities with physical 
15
obstructions in the line of sight of such radar. 
16
‘‘(b) REQUIREMENTS.—In carrying out the Program, 
17
the Director, in consultation with the Interagency Council 
18
for Advancing Meteorological Services, shall— 
19
‘‘(1) partner with industry, academia, Federal, 
20
State, and local government entities, and any other 
21
entity that the Director considers appropriate; 
22
‘‘(2) identify and test existing or near-commer-
23
cial technologies and solutions that mitigate the po-
24
tential impact of obstructions on a weather radar;

‘‘(3) research additional solutions that could 
1
mitigate the effects of an obstruction on weather 
2
radar, including— 
3
‘‘(A) signal processing algorithms; 
4
‘‘(B) short-term forecasting algorithms to 
5
replace contaminated data; and 
6
‘‘(C) the use of dual polarization charac-
7
teristics in mitigating the effects of wind tur-
8
bines on weather radar; and 
9
‘‘(4) develop commercially viable technical miti-
10
gation solutions for obstructions to weather radar 
11
capabilities. 
12
‘‘(c) PRIORITY.—In carrying out the requirements 
13
described in subsection (b), the Director shall prioritize 
14
consideration of— 
15
‘‘(1) multifunction phased array radar; 
16
‘‘(2) the replacement of contaminated data with 
17
commercial radar data; 
18
‘‘(3) the utilization of data from private-sector- 
19
associated meteorological towers; 
20
‘‘(4) providing wind farm boundaries and con-
21
solidated wind farm areas to display on local fore-
22
casting equipment; 
23
‘‘(5) installing and providing access to rain 
24
gauges; and

‘‘(6) any other technology-based mitigation so-
1
lution that the Director determines could overcome 
2
beam blockage or ghost echoes. 
3
‘‘(d) TERMINATION.—The authority of the Director 
4
to carry out the Program shall terminate on the earlier 
5
of— 
6
‘‘(1) September 30, 2027; or 
7
‘‘(2) 1 year after date on which the final rec-
8
ommendation required by subsection (e)(2) is sub-

‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—Not later than two years 
12
after the date of enactment of this section and annu-
13
ally thereafter until the Program terminates pursu-
14
ant to subsection (d), the Director shall submit to 
15
Congress a report on the implementation of the Pro-
16
gram, including an evaluation of each technology- 
17
based mitigation solution identified for priority con-
18
sideration in subsection (c), and a recommendation 
19
regarding additional identification and testing of 
20
new technologies based on such consideration. 
21
‘‘(2) FINAL
RECOMMENDATION.—Not later 
22
than five years after the date of enactment of this 
23
section, the Director shall provide to Congress a rec-
24
ommendation on whether additional research, test-

ing, and development through the Program estab-
1
lished by subsection (a) is needed, and a determina-
2
tion of whether a cessation of field research, develop-
3
ment, testing, and evaluation is appropriate.

‘‘(f) DEFINITIONS.—In this section: 
5
‘‘(1) BEAM BLOCKAGE.—The term ‘beam block-
6
age’ means a signal that is partially or fully blocked 
7
due to an obstruction. 
8
‘‘(2) DIRECTOR.—The term ‘Director’ means 
9
the Director of the National Weather Service. 
10
‘‘(3) GHOST
ECHO.—The term ‘ghost echo’ 
11
means radar signal reflectivity or velocity return er-
12
rors in radar data due to the close proximity of an 
13
obstruction. 
14
‘‘(4) OBSTRUCTION.—The term obstruction in-
15
cludes— 
16
‘‘(A) a wind turbine that could limit the ef-
17
fectiveness of a weather radar system; and 
18
‘‘(B) any building that disrupts or limits 
19
the effectiveness of a weather radar system.’’.
