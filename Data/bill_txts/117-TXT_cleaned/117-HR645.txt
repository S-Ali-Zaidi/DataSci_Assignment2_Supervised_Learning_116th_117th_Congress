RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the Secretary of State should designate the Afghan 
Taliban as a foreign terrorist organization, freeze all 
assets of the Government of Afghanistan held in the 
United States, and use all authority and influence of 
the United States Government to prohibit the distribu-
tion of funds to the Afghan Taliban by other countries 
and international institutions and organizations. 
Whereas the designation of an organization as a foreign ter-
rorist organization ‘‘play[s] a critical role in our fight

against terrorism and [is] an effective means of cur-
tailing support for terrorist activities’’, according to the 
Department of State; 
Whereas under section 219 of the Immigration and Nation-
ality Act (8 U.S.C. 1189), the Secretary of State may 
designate an organization as a foreign terrorist organiza-
tion if the organization is a foreign organization, the or-
ganization engages in terrorist activity or retains the ca-
pability and intent to engage in terrorist activity or ter-
rorism, and the terrorist activity or terrorism of the orga-
nization threatens the security of United States nationals 
or the national security of the United States; 
Whereas, as of August 2021, there are 72 designated foreign 
terrorist organizations, including radical Islamic terror 
groups such as al-Qaida, which was designated as a for-
eign terrorist organization in 1999; 
Whereas prior to the September 11, 2001, attacks on the 
United States, the Afghan Taliban provided a safe haven 
for al-Qaida to plan, train, and operate freely; 
Whereas following those attacks on the United States, which 
killed almost 3,000 people, the Afghan Taliban continued 
to support al-Qaida; 
Whereas al-Qaida first pledged allegiance to the Afghan 
Taliban in the 1990s and have reaffirmed their loyalty to 
the Afghan Taliban repeatedly since 2001; 
Whereas since the early 1990s, the Afghan Taliban have been 
responsible for the deaths of countless innocent civilians 
in Afghanistan, terrorizing the countryside and the cities 
alike; 
Whereas the United Nations report of the Analytical Support 
and Sanctions Monitoring Team released in June 2021

stated that ‘‘the [Afghan] Taliban and al-Qaida remain 
closely aligned and show no indication of breaking ties’’, 
and ‘‘al-Qaida is resident in at least 15 Afghan prov-
inces’’; 
Whereas according to the Afghanistan Study Group, ‘‘the 
[Afghan] Taliban have fallen short of their commitments: 
they have failed to fulfill their guarantee that they will 
not ‘cooperate with groups or individuals threatening the 
security of the United States and its allies’ and will ‘pre-
vent them from recruiting, training, and fundraising and 
will not host them’ ’’; 
Whereas the Afghan Taliban have continued their terrorist 
actions through targeted assassinations of former Afghan 
leaders, prominent civilian leaders, judges, journalists, 
and human rights advocates; 
Whereas an Afghanistan under Afghan Taliban control will 
result in further oppression of the Afghan people, includ-
ing women and girls, and the creation of a safe haven for 
radical Islamic terror groups, which will result in the 
United States homeland being less safe; 
Whereas the threat to the United States homeland has great-
ly increased now that the Afghan Taliban have taken 
control of Afghanistan; 
Whereas, on September 13, 2021, Secretary of State Antony 
Blinken testified before the House Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee that ‘‘the [Afghan] Taliban has been designated 
as a terrorist organization’’; 
Whereas it is critical that all elements of United States na-
tional power be used to prohibit the Afghan Taliban from 
using Afghanistan as a base from which radical Islamic

terror organizations can strike the United States home-
land, as they did on September 11, 2001; 
Whereas the Afghan Taliban share an ideology and interact 
closely with designated foreign terrorist organizations, in-
cluding al-Qaida in the Indian Subcontinent, the Haqqani 
Network, and Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan; 
Whereas the newly formed Afghan Taliban government in-
cludes in its senior ranks individuals subject to sanctions 
imposed by the United Nations and leaders of the 
Haqqani Network, all of whom are hostile to the United 
States; 
Whereas Sirajuddin Haqqani, the leader of the Haqqani Net-
work, which has targeted and killed United States citi-
zens, has been named as the Acting Interior Minister of 
Afghanistan; 
Whereas Sirajuddin Haqqani is listed on the Most Wanted 
list of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Re-
wards for Justice program of the Department of State is 
offering a reward of up to $10,000,000 for information 
leading to his arrest; 
Whereas Khalil al-Rahman Haqqani, the uncle of Sirajuddin 
Haqqani and a specially designated global terrorist under 
Executive Order 13224 (50 U.S.C. 1701 note; relating to 
blocking property and prohibiting transactions with per-
sons who commit, threaten to commit, or support ter-
rorism) for whom the Rewards for Justice program of the 
Department of State is offering a reward of $5,000,000 
for information leading to his arrest, has been named 
Acting Minister of Refugees of Afghanistan; 
Whereas the United States Government must do everything 
possible to limit the influence of the Afghan Taliban re-

gime, including denying the regime access to all money 
held by the United States Government, and should pres-
sure other countries to do the same; 
Whereas the Biden administration should use all authority 
and influence to prohibit international institutions and 
organizations from distributing funds within the jurisdic-
tion of those institutions and organizations to the Afghan 
Taliban regime; and 
Whereas the Biden administration should designate the take-
over of Afghanistan by the Afghan Taliban as a coup 
d’e´tat, and all foreign assistance to Afghanistan, includ-
ing funds administered by the United States Agency for 
International Development, should be withheld: Now, 
therefore, be it
