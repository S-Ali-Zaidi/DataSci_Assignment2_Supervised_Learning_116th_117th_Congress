Whereas such unit was created in response to the advocacy 
of Colonel Aaron Bank (United States Army, retired), 
known as the ‘‘Father of the Special Forces’’; 
Whereas Colonel Aaron Bank’s service in the Office of Stra-
tegic Services and his experience leading resistance fight-
ers against Nazi Germany convinced him of the need for 
permanent, elite units in the Armed Forces that would 
specialize in small unit and counterinsurgency tactics, in-
telligence operations, and the training of indigenous sol-
diers; 
Whereas, in 1952, the Army created its first special forces 
unit, the 10th Special Forces Group, at Fort Bragg, 
North Carolina, which would later be known for the dis-
tinctive green berets worn by its soldiers; 
Whereas Colonel Aaron Bank was assigned as the first com-
manding officer of the 10th Special Forces Group; 
Whereas the success of the United States Army Special 
Forces encouraged the incorporation of principles of force 
multiplication into the military doctrine of the United 
States and paved the way for the revitalization of special 
operations forces in the Navy, Air Force, and Marine 
Corps; 
Whereas these special operations forces have helped revolu-
tionize the conduct of modern warfare; 
Whereas special operations soldiers have served with bravery 
and distinction in every major military conflict in which 
the United States has been involved in the last 70 years 
and in innumerable covert operations; 
Whereas special operations soldiers are sometimes called 
upon to conduct missions so secret that their bravery 
cannot be fully recognized;

Whereas special operations soldiers are playing a critical role 
in the war against terrorism; and

duct unconventional warfare and to protect the United 
States from developing threats: Now, therefore, be it
