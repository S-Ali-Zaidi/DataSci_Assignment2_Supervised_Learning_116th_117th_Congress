Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 3886 IH
(1) Potential exists for increasing clean and re-
1
newable energy production and energy efficiency in-
2
stallation in the United States. 
3
(2) Other nations, including China and Ger-
4
many, are ahead of the United States in manufac-
5
turing and deploying various clean energy tech-
6
nologies, even though many of these technologies 
7
were invented in the United States. 
8
(3) Climate change represents an existential 
9
threat to the safety, security, and economy of the 
10
United States. Rapid and robust deployment of 
11
clean energy will reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
12
and mitigate the effects of climate change on Amer-
13
ican society. 
14
(4) Many segments of the American public 
15
want to take charge of efforts to combat the effects 
16
of climate change and practice responsible consumer 
17
behavior. 
18
(5) The Office of Energy Efficiency and Renew-
19
able Energy of the Department of Energy (referred 
20
to in this section as the ‘‘EERE’’) estimates that 
21
taxpayer investment of $12,000,000,000 into the 
22
EERE research and development portfolio has al-
23
ready yielded an estimated net economic benefit to 
24
the United States of more than $230,000,000,000,

with an overall annual return on investment of more 
1
than 20 percent. 
2
(6) Investments in renewable energy and energy 
3
efficiency projects in the United States create green 
4
jobs throughout the Nation. New and innovative jobs 
5
could be created through expanded government sup-
6
port for clean energy and energy efficiency. 
7
(7) As Americans choose energy efficiency and 
8
clean energy and transportation, it reduces our de-
9
pendence on foreign oil and improves our energy se-
10
curity. 
11
(8) Bonds are a low-cost method for encour-
12
aging clean energy, as they do not require direct 
13
budget allocations or expenditures. The projects sup-
14
ported through Clean Energy Victory Bonds will cre-
15
ate jobs and business revenues that will increase 
16
Federal tax revenues, while simultaneously reducing 
17
nationwide health and environmental costs incurred 
18
by the Federal Government. 
19
(9) Bonds are voluntary measures that allow 
20
Americans to contribute financially in whatever 
21
amount is available to them. 
22
(10) During World War II, over 80 percent of 
23
American households purchased Victory Bonds to 
24
support 
the 
war 
effort, 
raising
