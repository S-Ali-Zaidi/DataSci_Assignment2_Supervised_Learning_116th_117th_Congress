SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) United States personnel have suffered per-
3
sistent brain injuries after being targeted in attacks 
4
that have been increasing in number, geographic lo-
5
cation, and audacity. 
6
(2) In December 2016, a number of United 
7
States Embassy personnel in Havana, Cuba, began 
8
to experience the acute and sudden onset of unusual 
9
symptoms, usually concurrent with the perceived 
10
onset of a loud, directional noise, often accompanied 
11
by pain in the ears or the head and a sensation of 
12
pressure or vibration. 
13
(3) Symptoms, which have been chronic for 
14
some personnel, have included dizziness, hearing loss 
15
and tinnitus, vertigo, cognitive and motor impair-
16
ment, severe headaches, and insomnia. 
17
(4) A panel of experts convened by the Depart-
18
ment of State’s Bureau of Medical Services in July 
19
2017 to review triage assessments of medically eval-
20
uated personnel from the United States Embassy in 
21
Havana came to consensus that the findings were 
22
most likely related to neurotrauma from a non-
23
natural source.

(5) On August 11, 2017, Secretary of State 
1
Rex Tillerson characterized these episodes as ‘‘health 
2
attacks’’ against United States personnel in Cuba. 
3
(6) On September 29, 2017, the Department of 
4
State ordered the departure of non-essential per-
5
sonnel from the United States Embassy in Havana 
6
and issued a formal Cuba Travel Warning that stat-
7
ed: ‘‘Over the past several months, numerous U.S. 
8
Embassy Havana employees have been targeted in 
9
specific attacks. These employees have suffered sig-
10
nificant injuries as a consequence of these attacks.’’. 
11
(7) Other personnel at the United States Con-
12
sulate in Guangzhou, China, reported similar experi-
13
ences beginning in 2017. 
14
(8) A 2018 report, published in the Journal of 
15
the American Medical Association, based on clinical 
16
evaluation of affected personnel from United States 
17
Embassy, Havana, stated: ‘‘These individuals ap-
18
peared to have sustained injury to widespread brain 
19
networks without an associated history of head trau-
20
ma.’’. 
21
(9) The number and locations of these attacks 
22
have significantly expanded and, according to press 
23
reporting, as of May 2021 there have been more 
24
than 130 possible cases that have occurred in Asia, 
25
02:05 Aug 18, 2021

•HR 4914 IH
in Europe, and in the Western Hemisphere, includ-
1
ing within the United States. 
2
(10) According to press reporting, these attacks 
3
have occurred, among other places, at the homes of 
4
United States personnel, at hotels, and on public 
5
streets, including in the immediate vicinity of the 
6
White House, in Washington, DC. 
7
(11) A 2020 report by the National Academy of 
8
Sciences (NAS) found that ‘‘many of the distinctive 
9
and acute signs, symptoms, and observations re-
10
ported by [affected] employees are consistent with 
11
the effects of directed, pulsed radio frequency (RF) 
12
energy’’ and that ‘‘directed pulsed RF energy . . . 
13
appears to be the most plausible mechanism in ex-
14
plaining these cases’’. 
15
(12) According to the NAS report, ‘‘such a sce-
16
nario raises grave concerns about a world with 
17
disinhibited malevolent actors and new tools for 
18
causing harm to others’’. 
19
(13) The continuing and expanding scope of 
20
these attacks has become a serious security concern 
21
that is also undermining the morale of United States 
22
personnel, especially those posted at overseas diplo-
23
matic missions.

(14) Article 22 of the Vienna Convention on 
1
Diplomatic Relations states that ‘‘The receiving 
2
State is under a special duty to take all appropriate 
3
steps to protect the premises of [a foreign] mission 
4
against any intrusion or damage and to prevent any 
5
disturbance of the peace of the mission or impair-
6
ment of its dignity.’’. 
7
(15) The Convention on the Prevention and 
8
Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Pro-
9
tected Persons, including Diplomatic Agents, to 
10
which 180 countries are a party, protects diplomatic 
11
personnel from attacks on their persons, accom-
12
modations, or means of transport, and requires all 
13
state parties to punish and take measures to prevent 
14
such grave crimes.

SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
16
