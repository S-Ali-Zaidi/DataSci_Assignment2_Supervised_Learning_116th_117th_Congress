ARTICLE I 
1
Antony John Blinken, in his conduct while Secretary 
2
of State, engaged in a pattern of conduct that is incompat-
3
ible with his duties as an Officer of the United States, 
4
as follows: 
5
Secretary Blinken took an oath to defend and secure 
6
our country and uphold the Constitution when he was 
7
sworn in as Secretary of State on January 26, 2021. Arti-
8
cle II of the United States Constitution tasks the executive 
9
branch with ensuring the laws passed by Congress and 
10
signed into law by the President are faithfully executed. 
11
Secretary Blinken has failed to faithfully uphold his 
12
oath and has instead presided over a reckless abandon-
13
ment of our Nation’s interests, security, and values in his 
14
role in the withdrawal of American forces and diplomatic 
15
assets from Afghanistan. 
16
On April 14, 2021, President Biden announced that 
17
all United States troops will begin withdrawing from Af-
18
ghanistan starting May 1, 2021, and that the removal of 
19
troops would be completed by September 11, 2021. 
20
On April 24, 2021, Pentagon officials, national secu-
21
rity advisers, and Secretary Blinken, in a meeting with 
22
President Biden at the White House, indicated their belief 
23
that they could withdraw the remaining 3,500 American 
24
troops from Afghanistan by July 4, 2021.

During this same meeting, it was reported that the 
1
State Department articulated its ability and intention to 
2
keep the American Embassy in Kabul open and oper-
3
ational with more than 1,400 Americans remaining in 
4
country. 
5
On April 27, 2021, in apparent acknowledgment of 
6
the dangers posed by a resurgent Taliban, the American 
7
Embassy in Kabul ordered nearly 3,000 members of its 
8
staff to depart. 
9
On May 11, 2021, the Taliban—in furtherance of its 
10
speedy and sweeping campaign to recapture control of 
11
much of Afghanistan—captured the Nerkh district imme-
12
diately adjacent to Kabul. 
13
On May 15, 2021, Embassy officials sent an urgent 
14
warning to remaining Americans in the country that the 
15
‘‘U.S. Embassy strongly suggests that U.S. citizens make 
16
plans to leave Afghanistan as soon as possible.’’. 
17
On July 2, 2021, the American military vacated 
18
Bagram Air Base—the central United States military post 
19
in the country, including the prison on site housing over 
20
5,000 Taliban and suspected terrorist prisoners. The 
21
hasty evacuation left these prisoners as well as significant 
22
stockpiles of American weapons and equipment unguarded 
23
resulting in the eventual liberation of prisoners and sei-
24
zure of weapons and equipment by Taliban forces. On July

8, 2021, President Biden stated ‘‘there’s going to be no 
1
circumstance where you see people being lifted off the roof 
2
of an embassy of the United States from Afghanistan. It 
3
is not at all comparable.’’. 
4
On August 12, 2021, State Department spokesman, 
5
Ned Price, serving under the authority of Secretary 
6
Blinken stated ‘‘The embassy remains open, and we plan 
7
to continue our diplomatic work in Afghanistan.’’. Ross 
8
Wilson, the acting United States ambassador to Afghani-
9
stan who was on the call, said the staff still needed 72 
10
hours to leave. 
11
On August 15, 2021, the American Flag at the 
12
United States Embassy in Kabul was taken down. 
13
On August 15, 2021, Kabul and the Green Zone— 
14
the heart of the American diplomatic presence in Afghani-
15
stan—was recaptured by the Taliban and remains under 
16
its control. 
17
On August 25, 2021, American citizens were still at-
18
tempting to navigate through Taliban blockades, and 
19
widespread chaos on the streets of Kabul to Hamid Karzai 
20
International Airport in order to leave Afghanistan. 
21
On August 26, 2021, Secretary Blinken’s failure to 
22
execute his duties to safely and efficiently evacuate of all 
23
United States government personnel, dependents, and pri-
24
vate United States citizens when their lives are in danger

directly gave rise to a dangerous scenario at the Kabul 
1
airport enabling terrorists to execute a deadly attack that 
2
killed eleven marines and a Navy medic and further under-
3
mined his abilities to execute his duties under 22 U.S.C. 
4
4802(b). 
5
Secretary Blinken’s actions, including ignoring crit-
6
ical intelligence received from the embassy in Kabul and 
7
United States intelligence agencies, have left American 
8
property, military equipment and weapons in the hands 
9
of enemies of the United States, left American citizens 
10
stranded in life threatening situations in dereliction of his 
11
duties as Secretary of State (22 U.S.C. 2715; 22 U.S.C. 
12
4802). These actions have eroded American interests and 
13
security as well as our credibility and relationships 
14
amongst our closest allies. In failing to uphold his respon-
15
sibilities of his office, Secretary Blinken has failed to en-
16
sure the protection of the United States Government to 
17
American citizens, property, and interests in foreign coun-
18
tries. 
19
Wherefore, Antony John Blinken, by such conduct, 
20
warrants impeachment and trial, and removal from office.

•HRES 608 IH 
On August 10, 2021, as the crisis in Afghanistan was 
1
evident and worsening, Secretary Blinken’s spokesman, 
2
Ned Price, stated that ‘‘the United States continues to 
3
have leverage . . . and the Afghan Government has tre-
4
mendous leverage.’’. An assertion now proven obviously er-
5
roneous constituting the provision of false information to 
6
the Congress and American citizens. 
7
On August 15, 2021, the Taliban captured Kabul, 
8
the capital of Afghanistan. Over one week later, on August 
9
25, 2021, Secretary Blinken gave his first public briefing 
10
or interview since the collapse of Afghanistan. This is in 
11
direct violation of his statutory duty to keep the Com-
12
mittee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Com-
13
mittee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives 
14
fully and currently informed with respect to all activities 
15
and responsibilities within the jurisdiction of these com-
16
mittees (22 U.S.C. 2680(b)). 
17
On July 13, 2021, nearly two dozen American dip-
18
lomats, still remaining in the Kabul embassy, sent a memo 
19
directly to Secretary Blinken through the State Depart-
20
ment’s ‘‘dissent’’ channel. The cable, first reported by the 
21
Wall Street Journal on August 19, 2021, urged that evac-
22
uation flights for Afghans begin in two weeks and that 
23
the administration move faster to register them for visas.

•HRES 608 IH 
Five days prior to Secretary Blinken receiving the 
1
cable through the dissent channel from Kabul, President 
2
Biden stated that the Afghan Government was unlikely 
3
to fall and there would be no chaotic evacuations of Ameri-
4
cans similar to the end of Vietnam. Upon receiving the 
5
dissent cable from the Embassy, Secretary Blinken had 
6
a moral duty and was statutorily obligated to inform the 
7
Congress and American public (22 U.S.C. 2680(b)) that 
8
President Biden’s remarks needed to be clarified to pre-
9
vent any confusion at home and abroad. 
10
Throughout the month of July and into August, prior 
11
to the collapse of the Afghan Government, the United 
12
States Intelligence Community warned President Biden 
13
and his top advisors, including Secretary Blinken, that the 
14
situation in Afghanistan was worsening, the Afghan mili-
15
tary was ill-prepared to deal with the Taliban, and a pre-
16
emptive removal of American troops was ill-advised. 
17
In direct conflict with the intelligence and advice pro-
18
vided by his own diplomats and the intelligence commu-
19
nity, Secretary Blinken failed to advise and counsel the 
20
President accordingly and did not inform the Congress nor 
21
American citizens at home and abroad of the dangers 
22
posed by the advancing Taliban of which he was explicitly 
23
aware.

As a result, the Afghan Government collapsed in the 
1
month of August 2021 and American forces have been 
2
struggling to retrieve American civilians and allies, and 
3
a humanitarian crisis has erupted at Hamid Karzai Air-
4
port in Kabul. Secretary Blinken has not informed the 
5
American public nor Congress of what actions will be 
6
taken to ensure the safety of all Americans and American 
7
allies in Afghanistan. 
8
Wherefore, Antony John Blinken, by such conduct,

warrants impeachment and trial, and removal from office.
