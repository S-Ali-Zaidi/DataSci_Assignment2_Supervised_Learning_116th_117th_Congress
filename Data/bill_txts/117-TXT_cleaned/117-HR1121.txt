RESOLUTION 
Calling for the immediate release of Russian opposition lead-
er Vladimir Kara-Murza, who was unjustly detained on 
April 11, 2022. 
Whereas Vladimir Vladimirovich Kara-Murza (referred to in 
this preamble as ‘‘Mr. Kara-Murza’’) has tirelessly 
worked for decades to advance the cause of freedom, de-
mocracy, and human rights for the people of the Russian 
Federation; 
Whereas, in retaliation for his advocacy, two attempts have 
been made on Mr. Kara-Murza’s life, as—

•HRES 1121 IH 
(1) on May 26, 2015, Mr. Kara-Murza fell ill with 
symptoms indicative of poisoning and was hospitalized; 
and 
(2) on February 2, 2017, he fell ill with similar 
symptoms and was placed in a medically induced coma; 
Whereas independent investigations conducted by Bellingcat, 
the Insider, and Der Spiegel found that the same unit of 
the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation 
responsible for poisoning Mr. Kara-Murza was respon-
sible for poisoning Russian opposition leader Alexei 
Navalny 
and 
activists 
Timur 
Kuashev, 
Ruslan 
Magomedragimov, and Nikita Isayev; 
Whereas, on February 24, 2022, Vladimir Putin launched an-
other unprovoked, unjustified, and illegal invasion into 
Ukraine in contravention of the obligations freely under-
taken by the Russian Federation to respect the territorial 
integrity of Ukraine under the Budapest Memorandum of 
1994, the Minsk protocols of 2014 and 2015, and inter-
national law; 
Whereas, on March 5, 2022, Vladimir Putin signed a law 
criminalizing the distribution of truthful statements 
about the invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation 
and mandating up to 15 years in prison for such of-
fenses; 
Whereas, since February 24, 2022, Mr. Kara-Murza has used 
his voice and platform to join more than 15,000 citizens 
of the Russian Federation in peacefully protesting the 
war against Ukraine and millions more who silently op-
pose the war; 
Whereas, on April 11, 2022, five police officers arrested Mr. 
Kara-Murza in front of his home and denied his right to

an attorney, and the next day Mr. Kara-Murza was sen-
tenced to 15 days in prison for disobeying a police order; 
Whereas, on April 22, 2022, the Investigative Committee of 
the Russian Federation charged Mr. Kara-Murza with 
violations under the law signed on March 5, 2022, for his 
fact-based statements condemning the invasion of 
Ukraine by the Russian Federation; 
Whereas Mr. Kara-Murza was then placed into pretrial de-
tention and ordered to be held until at least June 12, 
2022; and 
Whereas, if convicted of those charges, Mr. Kara-Murza faces 
detention in a penitentiary system that human rights 
nongovernmental organizations have criticized for wide-
spread torture, ill-treatment, and suspicious deaths of 
prisoners: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) condemns the unjust detention and indict-

ing 
of 
Russian 
opposition 
leader
