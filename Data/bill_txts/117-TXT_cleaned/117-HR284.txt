RESOLUTION 
Affirming that all men and women are created equal. 
Whereas the advancement of gender equality is fundamental 
to the democracy of the United States; 
Whereas the Declaration of Independence states, ‘‘We hold 
these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created 
equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with cer-
tain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Lib-
erty and the pursuit of Happiness’’; 
Whereas the Declaration of Sentiments and Resolutions, 
drafted by Elizabeth Cady Stanton at Seneca Falls, New 
York, in 1848, and based on the Declaration of Inde-
pendence, reiterates that both genders are endowed with 
unalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of hap-
piness;

Whereas, in 1919, the 66th Congress of the United States 
passed a resolution proposing an amendment to the Con-
stitution extending the right of suffrage to women; 
Whereas, in 1920, the 19th Amendment was adopted to the 
Constitution of the United States, guaranteeing all 
women the right to vote in elections throughout the coun-
try; 
Whereas the resolution proposing the Equal Rights Amend-
ment to the States for ratification, which was first intro-
duced in Congress in 1923 and agreed to with bipartisan 
support in 1972, provides that ‘‘Equality of rights under 
the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United 
States or by any State on account of sex’’, thereby ensur-
ing the same constitutional protections for both men and 
women; 
Whereas women have served in the labor movements, civil 
rights movements, and other causes to create a more fair 
and just society for all; and 
Whereas, while there has been exceptional progress toward 
gender equality and parity in the United States since the 
drafting of the Declaration of Sentiments and Resolu-
tions in 1848, women continue to experience institu-
tionalized discrimination, gender-based violence, and sys-
tematic barriers to equality: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) recognizes that all men and women are cre-

ated equal; 
3
(2) honors the historic and ongoing contribu-

tions and achievements of women in the United
