A BILL 
To amend the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to require 
a section on reproductive rights in the Annual Country 
Reports on Human Rights Practices, and for other pur-
poses. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Reproductive Rights 
4
are Human Rights Act of 2021’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) The United States has joined the inter-
8
national community in identifying reproductive 
9
rights as human rights, including in connection with 
10
the 1994 International Conference on Population 
11
and Development, the 1995 Beijing World Con-
12
ference on Women, and through its ratification of 
13
the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
14
Rights, done at New York December 19, 1966 (re-
15
ferred to in this Act as ‘‘ICCPR’’), the International 
16
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Ra-
17
cial Discrimination, done at New York December 21,

1965, and the Convention against Torture and 
1
Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
2
Punishment, done at New York December 10, 1984. 
3
(2) General comment No. 36 (2018) on article 
4
6 of the ICCPR, which was adopted by the Human 
5
Rights Committee on October 30, 2018, asserts that 
6
States parties— 
7
(A) should ensure access for all persons to 
8
‘‘quality and evidence-based information and 
9
education about sexual and reproductive health 
10
and to a wide range of affordable contraceptive 
11
methods’’; 
12
(B) ‘‘must provide safe, legal, and effective 
13
access to abortion where the life and health of 
14
the pregnant woman or girl is at risk, or where 
15
carrying a pregnancy to term would cause the 
16
pregnant woman or girl substantial pain or suf-
17
fering, most notably where pregnancy is the re-
18
sult of rape or incest or is not viable’’; 
19
(C) ‘‘ensure the availability of, and effec-
20
tive access to, quality prenatal and post-abor-
21
tion health care for women and girls’’; and 
22
(D) must not impose restrictions on the 
23
ability of women or girls to seek abortion in a 
24
manner that jeopardizes their lives, subjects

them to physical or mental pain or suffering, 
1
discriminates against them, arbitrarily inter-
2
feres with their privacy, or places them at risk 
3
of undertaking unsafe abortions. 
4
(3) Reproductive coercion, which is any behav-
5
ior that interferes with autonomous decision making 
6
about reproductive health outcomes, is a violation of 
7
human rights. 
8
(4) Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, 
9
and intersex persons (LGBTQI+) face stigma and 
10
discrimination in accessing reproductive health serv-
11
ices, and barriers, including anti-LGBTQI+ laws, 
12
policies, and gender norms in countries. The denial 
13
of access to sexual and reproductive health care and 
14
associated human rights violations due to these bar-
15
riers should be reported in relevant Department of 
16
State Annual Country Reports on Human Rights 
17
Practices. 
18
(5) Human rights are grounded in international 
19
standards. The Department of State’s deletion of 
20
the reproductive rights subsection from its 2017, 
21
2018, and 2019 Country Reports on Human Rights 
22
Practices inappropriately politicized human rights of 
23
people around the world.

(6) Limiting reproductive rights also limits 
1
pathways to economic, social, and political empower-
2
ment. Sexual and reproductive health and rights are 
3
essential for sustainable economic development, are 
4
intrinsically linked to gender equality and women’s 
5
well-being, and are critical to community health. 
6
(7) The global COVID–19 pandemic has placed 
7
at risk the fulfillment of reproductive rights. The 
8
United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for 
9
Human Rights has raised concerns that overloaded 
10
health systems, shortages of medical supplies, and 
11
disruptions of global supply chains have undermined 
12
the sexual and reproductive health and rights of in-
13
dividuals.
