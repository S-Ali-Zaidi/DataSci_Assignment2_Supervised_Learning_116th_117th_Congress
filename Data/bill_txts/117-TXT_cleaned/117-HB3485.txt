SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
5
Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) The dignity, freedom, and equality of all 
7
human beings are fundamental to a thriving global 
8
community. 
9
(2) The rights to life, liberty, and security of 
10
the person, the right to privacy, and the right to 
11
freedom of expression and association are funda-
12
mental human rights. 
13
(3) An alarming trend of violence directed at 
14
LGBTQI individuals around the world continues. 
15
(4) Approximately one-third of all countries 
16
have laws criminalizing consensual same-sex rela-
17
tions, and many have enacted policies or laws that 
18
would further target LGBTQI individuals. 
19
(5) Every year thousands of individuals around 
20
the world are targeted for harassment, attack, ar-
21
rest, and murder on the basis of their sexual ori-
22
entation or gender identity.

(6) Those who commit crimes against LGBTQI 
1
individuals often do so with impunity, and are not 
2
held accountable for their crimes. 
3
(7) Homophobic and transphobic statements by 
4
government officials in many countries in every re-
5
gion of the world promote negative public attitudes 
6
and can lead to violence toward LGBTQI individ-
7
uals. 
8
(8) In many instances police, prison, military, 
9
and civilian government authorities have been di-
10
rectly complicit in abuses aimed at LGBTQI citi-
11
zens, including arbitrary arrest, torture, and sexual 
12
abuse. 
13
(9) Celebrations of LGBTQI individuals and 
14
communities, such as film festivals, Pride events, 
15
and demonstrations are often forced underground 
16
due to inaction on the part of, or harassment by, 
17
local law enforcement and government officials, in 
18
violation of freedoms of assembly and expression. 
19
(10) Laws criminalizing consensual same-sex 
20
relations severely hinder access to HIV/AIDS treat-
21
ment, information, and preventive measures for 
22
LGBTQI individuals and families.
