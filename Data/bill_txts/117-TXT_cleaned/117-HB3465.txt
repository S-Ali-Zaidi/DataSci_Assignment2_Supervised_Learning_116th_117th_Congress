•HR 3465 IH
(1) The 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Ac-
1
tion 
(JCPOA) 
provided 
Iran 
with 
over 
2
$100,000,000,000 in sanctions relief, circumventing 
3
mandatory sanctions imposed by the Congress of the 
4
United States. 
5
(2) 
The 
Obama 
Administration 
delivered 
6
$400,000,000 in cash to Iran in 2016. 
7
(3) President Trump wisely removed the United 
8
States from the disastrous JCPOA on May 8, 2018, 
9
and implemented a campaign of maximum economic 
10
pressure on Iran until the regime ends its nuclear 
11
program, its pursuit of ballistic missiles, its support 
12
of terrorism and regional destabilization, and re-
13
leases all United States hostages. 
14
(4) Iran and China signed a 25-year strategic 
15
economic cooperation agreement on March 27, 2021. 
16
(5) This agreement involves a transfer of 
17
$400,000,000,000 from the Chinese Communist 
18
Party to the Iranian Government. 
19
(6) The Chinese Communist Party is commit-
20
ting an ongoing genocide against Uighur Muslims in 
21
the Xinjiang region and suppressing religious free-
22
dom across the country. 
23
(7) The Chinese Communist Party is also sup-
24
pressing religious freedom by wrongly imprisoning

Christians, raiding house churches, and attempting 
1
to shut down houses of worship not endorsed by the 
2
government. 
3
(8) The Iranian government is perpetrating vio-
4
lence against its own people, including through the 
5
killing of protesters, and the persecution of women 
6
and religious minorities. It is also involved in severe 
7
violations of human rights throughout the Middle 
8
East, including supporting the brutal Assad regime 
9
in Syria. 
10
(9) China has increased its purchases of oil 
11
from Iran, in violation of United States sanctions, in 
12
the past few months. Such oil sales would be per-
13
mitted if the United States lifts sanctions on Iran 
14
and re-enters the failed Iran nuclear deal. 
15
(10) The failed Iran nuclear deal required that 
16
the United Nations arms embargo on Iran expire in 
17
October 2020, which permits China to sell arms to 
18
Iran, and permits Iran to sell arms to China. 
19
(11) The United States Government unequivo-
20
cally condemns the Hamas-incited terrorist attacks 
21
originating from Israeli land currently occupied by 
22
Hamas.
