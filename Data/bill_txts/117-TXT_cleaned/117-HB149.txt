•HR 149 IH
(1) Peter J. McGuire joined the Cabinet Mak-
1
ers Union of New York in 1872 and, recognizing the 
2
need for one international union of wood workers, 
3
called for and led a convention of carpenters and 
4
joiners in Chicago in 1881 that formed the Brother-
5
hood of Carpenters and Joiners which became the 
6
United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of 
7
America in 1888. 
8
(2) The Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners 
9
elected McGuire its first general secretary and re-
10
tained him in that position for twenty years. 
11
(3) McGuire was a leader in convincing skep-
12
tical, locally minded union activists around the 
13
United States that a national labor federation was 
14
not only necessary, but also possible. 
15
(4) McGuire co-founded with Samuel Gompers 
16
the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor 
17
Unions and, in 1886, reorganized it into the Amer-
18
ican Federation of Labor. 
19
(5) McGuire served variously as the American 
20
Federation of Labor secretary and vice president be-
21
tween 1886 and 1900. 
22
(6) McGuire successfully led the fight for the 
23
eight-hour day in 1890.

(7) In 1882, McGuire proposed that ‘‘one day 
1
in the year be designated as Labor Day’’, a proposal 
2
that was adopted first by a number of States and 
3
then as the first Monday in September by an Act of 
4
Congress in 1894. 
5
(8) Upon McGuire’s death in 1906, the United 
6
Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners commis-
7
sioned from M.C. Lyons and Sons, Camden, and had 
8
installed a massive granite multistage headstone on 
9
McGuire’s gravesite in the Arlington Cemetery at 
10
1629 Cove Road, Pennsauken, New Jersey, inscribed 
11
with ‘‘P.J. MCGUIRE, BORN JULY 6, 1852 
12
DIED FEB. 18, 1906’’ and ‘‘FOUNDER OF U.B. 
13
OF C. & J. OF A.’’. 
14
(9) Beginning in 1906, each year labor leaders, 
15
political leaders, families, and working people gather 
16
at McGuire’s gravesite on Labor Day to lay wreaths 
17
and deliver speeches in tribute to McGuire and his 
18
great work. 
19
(10) As the anniversary of McGuire’s centennial 
20
birthday approached, the organizations he had 
21
helped to found decided to install a new memorial a 
22
short distance from McGuire’s gravesite, consisting 
23
of a central statue of McGuire embraced by a semi- 
24
circular colonnade of marble columns.

5

12
of six Greek Doric columns, also made of Cher-
13
okee Georgia marble;

and Peter J. McGuire Gravesite every September on 
19
