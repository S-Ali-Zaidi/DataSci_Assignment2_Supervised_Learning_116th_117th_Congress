Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Veterans Online Infor-

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
8
(1) Researchers have documented persistent, 
9
pervasive, and coordinated online targeting of mem-

bers of the Armed Forces, veterans, and their fami-
1
lies by foreign adversaries seeking to undermine 
2
United States democracy in part because of public 
3
trust placed in these communities. Government 
4
agencies and researchers have also documented the 
5
targeting of veterans by fraudsters, especially online 
6
scammers, seeking to steal their government bene-
7
fits. 
8
(2) According to the Federal Trade Commis-
9
sion, fraud costs veterans, members of the Armed 
10
Forces, and their families $267,000,000 in 2021. 
11
This was a 162-percent increase from 2020 and the 
12
median loss for these scam victims was $600, 20 
13
percent higher than for the median loss for the gen-
14
eral public. According to a 2017 survey conducted 
15
by the American Association of Retired Persons 
16
(AARP) veterans are twice as likely to unknowingly 
17
participate in a scam compared to the general popu-
18
lation and an estimated 16 percent of veterans re-
19
port having losing some money to fraud, while 78 
20
percent report encountering scams that have explic-
21
itly designed to exploit their military service. 
22
(3) At the same time, adversaries from Russia, 
23
China, and Iran are using information warfare to in-
24
fluence democracies across the world, and extremist

organizations often use digital communications to re-
1
cruit members. Influence campaigns from foreign 
2
adversaries reached tens of millions of voters during 
3
the 2016 and 2018 elections with racially and divi-
4
sively targeted messages. The United States can 
5
fight these influences by ensuring that citizens of 
6
the United States possess the necessary skills to dis-
7
cern disinformation and misinformation and protect 
8
themselves from foreign influence campaigns. 
9
(4) The Select Committee on Intelligence of the 
10
Senate found in its investigation of the interference 
11
in the 2016 election that social media posts by the 
12
Internet Research Agency (IRA) of Russia reached 
13
tens of millions of voters in 2016 and were meant 
14
to pit the people of the United States against one 
15
another and sow discord. Volume II of the Commit-
16
tee’s investigation found that the Internet Research 
17
Agency’s Instagram account with the second largest 
18
reach used the handle ‘‘@american.veterans’’ and 
19
was ‘‘aimed at patriotic, conservative audiences, col-
20
lected 215,680 followers, and generated nearly 18.5 
21
million engagements.’’. 
22
(5) A 2019 investigative report by the Vietnam 
23
Veterans of America (VVA) titled ‘‘An Investigation 
24
into Foreign Entities who are Targeting Troops and

Veterans Online’’, found that the Internet Research 
1
Agency targeted veterans and the followers of sev-
2
eral congressionally chartered veterans service orga-
3
nizations with at least 113 advertisements during 
4
and following the 2016 election and that ‘‘this rep-
5
resents a fraction of the Russian activity that tar-
6
geted this community with divisive propaganda.’’. 
7
The report also found that foreign actors have been 
8
impersonating veterans through social-media ac-
9
counts and interacting with veterans and veterans 
10
groups on social media to spread propaganda and 
11
disinformation. To counter these acts, Vietnam Vet-
12
erans of America recommended that the Department 
13
of Veterans Affairs ‘‘immediately develop plans to 
14
make the cyber-hygiene of veterans an urgent pri-
15
ority within the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
16
The VA must educate and train veterans on per-
17
sonal cybersecurity: how to mitigate vulnerabilities, 
18
vigilantly maintain safe practices, and recognize 
19
threats, including how to identify instances of online 
20
manipulation.’’.

lic Law 115–232), concluded in its finished report 
1
that the ‘‘U.S. government should promote digital 
2
literacy, civics education, and public awareness to 
3
build societal resilience to foreign, malign cyber-en-
4
abled information operations and that the U.S. gov-
5
ernment must ensure that individual Americans have 
6
both the digital literacy tools and the civics edu-
7
cation they need to secure their networks and their 
8
democracy from cyber-enabled information oper-
9
ations.’’. The report recommended that Congress au-
10
thorize grant programs to do this. 
11
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
12
It is the sense of Congress that, given the threat for-
13
eign influence campaigns pose for United States democ-
14
racy, the effect of online scams on veterans and their fami-
15
lies, and the findings and recommendations of Congress, 
16
Federal agencies, and experts, Congress should imme-
17
diately act to pass legislative measures to increase digital 
18
and media literacy, as well as cybersecurity best practices 
19
among veterans of the United States.
