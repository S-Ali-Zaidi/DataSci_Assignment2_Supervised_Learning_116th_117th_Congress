RESOLUTION 
Committing to ensuring that Iran will never acquire a nu-
clear weapon and supporting the important work of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency in safeguarding nu-
clear material around the globe. 
Whereas Congress and several successive Presidential admin-
istrations have long sought to prevent Iran from ever ac-
quiring a nuclear weapon; 
Whereas it is currently estimated that Iran is almost to the 
point of having enough highly enriched nuclear material 
to produce a nuclear weapon, if further enriched; 
Whereas, on March 3, 2020, the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) Director General reported to the Agen-
cy’s Board of Governors that nuclear material was found 
at 3 previously undisclosed locations in Iran;

Whereas the IAEA reported it began investigating this mat-
ter pursuant to Iran’s IAEA safeguards obligations in 
2019; 
Whereas the IAEA and the Atomic Energy Organization of 
Iran announced an agreement on March 5, 2022, wherein 
Iran committed to provide the IAEA with information 
and documents in response to the IAEA’s questions re-
lated to uranium particles discovered at undeclared sites 
in Iran; 
Whereas, on June 6, 2022, the Director General of the IAEA 
stated that ‘‘Iran has not provided explanations that are 
technically credible in relation to the Agency’s findings at 
three undeclared locations in Iran. Nor has Iran informed 
the Agency of the current location, or locations, of the 
nuclear material and/or of the equipment contaminated 
with nuclear material, that was moved from Turquzabad 
in 2018’’; 
Whereas, on June 8, 2022, the IAEA Board of Governors 
overwhelmingly adopted a resolution calling on Iran to 
cooperate with the IAEA on an urgent basis to fulfill its 
safeguards obligations and expressing profound concern 
with Iran’s insufficient substantive cooperation thus far, 
with 30 Board Members voting in favor, 2 voting against, 
and 3 abstaining; 
Whereas the IAEA Board of Governors resolution called upon 
Iran to ‘‘act on an urgent basis to fulfill its legal obliga-
tions and, without delay, take up the Director General’s 
offer of further engagement to clarify and resolve all out-
standing safeguards issues’’; 
Whereas shortly before the IAEA Board of Governors vote 
adopting the resolution, Iran announced it would remove

27 IAEA cameras installed to monitor the separate issue 
of Iran’s JCPOA commitments at certain Iranian facili-
ties and Iran has since followed through on disconnecting 
these cameras; and 
Whereas following the vote of the IAEA Board of Governors, 
Iran informed the IAEA it would install additional cas-
cades of advanced IR–6 centrifuges at its Natanz facility, 
and Iran has since followed through on installing these 
advanced centrifuges: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) reiterates its commitment to ensuring Iran 
2
will never acquire a nuclear weapon; 
3
(2) supports the important work of the IAEA 
4
in safeguarding nuclear material around the globe; 
5
(3) condemns Iran for its lack of transparency 
6
and meaningful cooperation with the IAEA on this 
7
unresolved matter of uranium particles discovered at 
8
undeclared sites in Iran and for its additional 
9
escalatory actions related to its nuclear program; 
10
and 
11
(4) applauds the IAEA Board of Governors res-
12
olution urging Iran’s full cooperation with the IAEA 
13
on outstanding safeguards issues on an urgent basis.
