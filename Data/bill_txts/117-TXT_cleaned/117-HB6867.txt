SECTION 1. FINDINGS. 
3
Congress finds that— 
4
(1) the dictatorship imposed by Fidel Castro in 
5
Cuba in 1959 started 61 years of an ongoing dicta-
6
torship, systemic human rights abuses, and a lack of

basic freedom of press, religion, assembly, and asso-
1
ciation that continue to this day under Communist 
2
rule; 
3
(2) Oswaldo Paya´ Sardin˜as was a Cuban pro-
4
democracy activist dedicated to promoting demo-
5
cratic freedoms and human rights in Cuba; 
6
(3) the Communist Party of Cuba has always 
7
viewed that commitment to democracy and freedom 
8
as a threat to the existence of the Communist Party 
9
of Cuba; 
10
(4) on July 22, 2012, a violent car crash, wide-
11
ly believed to have been carried out by the Castro re-
12
gime, took the lives of Oswaldo Paya´ and Harold 
13
Cepero, another prodemocracy activist; 
14
(5) the regime in Cuba has offered no plausible 
15
evidence of the innocence of the Castro regime in the 
16
crash, leaving the circumstances of the death of 
17
Oswaldo Paya´ suspicious; 
18
(6) opposition by Oswaldo Paya´ to the Com-
19
munist Party of Cuba began at a young age, when 
20
he refused to become a member of the Young Com-
21
munist League as a primary school student, and 
22
continued through high school, when he publicly 
23
criticized the invasion of Czechoslovakia by the So-
24
viet Union;

(7) the Communist Party of Cuba responded to 
1
the opposition by Oswaldo Paya´ to the invasion of 
2
Czechoslovakia by the Soviet Union by sending 
3
Oswaldo Paya´ to a labor camp for 3 years; 
4
(8) Oswaldo Paya´ forewent a chance to escape 
5
Cuba in the 1980 Mariel boatlift, deciding instead to 
6
continue the fight for democracy in Cuba, saying, 
7
‘‘This is what I am supposed to be, this is what I 
8
have to do.’’; 
9
(9) Oswaldo Paya´ repeatedly demonstrated his 
10
staunch commitment to peacefully advocating for 
11
freedom of speech, religious liberty, and freedom of 
12
assembly for his fellow Cubans; 
13
(10) in recognition of his determination for po-
14
litical reforms through peaceful protests, Oswaldo 
15
Paya´ was awarded the Sakharov Prize for Freedom 
16
of Thought by the European Parliament in 2002 
17

18
from the National Democratic Institute for Inter-
19
national Affairs in 2003 and was nominated for the

21

24
