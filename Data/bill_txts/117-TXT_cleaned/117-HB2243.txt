A BILL 
To amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to prohibit 
discrimination in the payment of wages on account of 
sex, race, or national origin, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

(b) REFERENCE.—Except as provided in section 8,

1
Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 201 et seq.).

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
3
Congress finds the following: 
4
(1) Wage rate differentials exist between equiv-
5
alent jobs segregated by sex, race, and national ori-
6
gin in Government employment and in industries en-
7
gaged in commerce or in the production of goods for 
8
commerce. 
9
(2) Discrimination in hiring and promotion has 
10
played a role in maintaining a segregated work 
11
force. 
12
(3) Many women and people of color work in 
13
occupations dominated by individuals of their same 
14
sex, race, and national origin. 
15
(A) While a wage rate differential exists in 
16
nearly every occupational field, traditionally 
17
male jobs tend to pay better than traditionally 
18
female jobs which require equal skill, effort, and 
19
responsibility, and which are performed under 
20
similar working conditions. 
21
(B) Traditionally male jobs that are low- 
22
wage require less skill, education, and certifi-
23
cations than traditionally female jobs that are 
24
03:03 May 25, 2021
H2243

•HR 2243 IH
low-wage, despite their generally receiving high-
1
er pay. 
2
(4) In 2015, a woman in the United States 
3
working in a full-time, year-round job earned 80 
4
cents for every dollar earned by a man working in 
5
a full-time, year-round job. 
6
(A) The wage gap is larger when the data 
7
is disaggregated by race. Among women who 
8
hold full-time, year-round jobs in the United 
9
States, African-American women were paid on 
10
average, only 63 percent of what White men 
11
were paid in 2015, while Native Hawaiian and 
12
Other Pacific Islander women were paid 60 per-
13
cent, American Indian and Alaska Native 
14
women were paid 58 percent, and Hispanic and 
15
Latina women were paid only 54 percent. 
16
(B) The gender pay gap persists across 
17
educational levels. As a result, women who com-
18
plete college degrees are less able to pay off 
19
their student loans promptly, leaving them pay-
20
ing more and for a longer time than men. In 
21
2012, among students who graduated in 2007– 
22
2008, women working full time had paid off 33 
23
percent of their student loan debt on average, 
24
03:03 May 25, 2021
H2243
4 
•HR 2243 IH
while men working full time had paid off 44 
1
percent of their debt. 
2
(C) In the United States, mothers are pri-
3
mary or sole breadwinners in nearly 40 percent 
4
of families. Yet the wage gap for mothers is 
5
larger than for women overall. According to 
6
2013 data, mothers employed full time, year 
7
round are paid 71 cents for every dollar paid to 
8
fathers. It is worse for single mothers with full- 
9
time, year-round jobs, who are paid just 58 
10
cents for every dollar paid to fathers. 
11
(D) A conservative estimate is that women 
12
employed in the United States lose a combined 
13
total of nearly $500 billion every year due to 
14
the wage gap. These women, their families, 
15
businesses and the economy suffer as a result. 
16
Lost wages mean families have less money to 
17
save for the future or to spend on basic goods 
18
and services—spending that helps drive the 
19
economy. 
20
(E) Statistical analysis shows that 62 per-
21
cent of the wage gap can be attributed to occu-
22
pational and industry differences; differences in 
23
experience and education; and factors such as 
24
race, region and unionization. That leaves 38 
25
03:03 May 25, 2021
H2243
5 
•HR 2243 IH
percent of the gap unaccounted for, leading re-
1
searchers to conclude that factors such as dis-
2
crimination and unconscious bias continue to 
3
affect women’s wages. 
4
(5) The existence of such wage rate differen-
5
tials— 
6
(A) depresses wages and living standards 
7
for employees necessary for their health and ef-
8
ficiency; 
9
(B) prevents the maximum utilization of 
10
the available labor resources; 
11
(C) tends to cause labor disputes, thereby 
12
burdening, affecting, and obstructing com-
13
merce; 
14
(D) burdens commerce and the free flow of 
15
goods in commerce; 
16
(E) constitutes an unfair method of com-
17
petition; and 
18
(F) contributes to poor living conditions, 
19
poor nutrition, and fewer opportunities for fam-
20
ilies with children under 18 where the mother 
21
is the sole or primary breadwinner. 
22
(6) Section 6(d) of the Fair Labor Standards 
23
Act of 1938 prohibits discrimination in compensa-
24
tion for ‘‘equal work’’ on the basis of sex. 
25

H2243

•HR 2243 IH
(7) Artificial barriers to the elimination of dis-
1
crimination in compensation based upon sex, race, 
2
and national origin continue to exist more than five 
3
decades after the passage of section 6(d) of the Fair 
4
Labor Standards Act of 1938, the Equal Pay Act of 
5
1963, and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 
6
2000a et seq.). Elimination of such barriers would 
7
have positive effects. 
8
(A) Problems in the economy created by 
9
discrimination through wage rate differentials 
10
would be reduced. In 2012, the U.S. economy 
11
would have produced additional income of 
12
$447.6 billion if women received equal pay; this 
13
represents 2.9 percent of 2012 gross domestic 
14
product. 
15
(B) Fewer working women and people of 
16
color would earn low wages, thereby reducing 
17
dependence on public assistance. The total in-
18
crease in women’s earnings with pay equity rep-
19
resents more than 14 times what the Federal 
20
and State governments spent in fiscal year 
21
2012 on Temporary Assistance to Needy Fami-
22
lies. 
23
(C) Working family members earning a 
24
fair rate of pay would encourage stable families 
25
03:03 May 25, 2021

and reduce poverty. The poverty rate for all 
1
working women would be cut in half, falling to 
2
3.9 percent from 8.1 percent. The very high 
3
poverty rate for working single mothers would 
4
fall by nearly half, from 28.7 percent to 15.0 
5
percent, and two-thirds would receive a pay in-
6
crease.
