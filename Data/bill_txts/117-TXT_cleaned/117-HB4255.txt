(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than one year after the

of the United States shall conduct a study and submit to

the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation

of the Senate and the Committee on Energy and Com-

(1) examines— 
8
(A) the processes used by the National

Highway Traffic Safety Administration (re-

dummies;

(B)(i) the types of crash test dummies 
14
used by the Administration as of the date of en-
15
actment of this Act; 
16
(ii) the seating positions in which those 
17
crash test dummies are tested; and 
18
(iii) whether the seating position affects 
19
disparities in motor vehicle safety outcomes 
20
based on demographic characteristics, including 
21
sex, and, if so, how the seating position affects 
22
those disparities;

(C) the biofidelic crash test dummies that
