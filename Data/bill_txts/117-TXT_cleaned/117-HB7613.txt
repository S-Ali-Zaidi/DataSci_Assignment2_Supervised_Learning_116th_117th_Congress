‘‘(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
14
‘‘(1) The rapidly developing array of internet 
15
and other interactive computer services available to 
16
individual Americans represent an extraordinary ad-
17
vance in the availability of educational and informa-
18
tional resources to our citizens. 
19
‘‘(2) These services often offer users a great de-
20
gree of control over the information that they re-
21
ceive, as well as the potential for even greater con-
22
trol in the future as technology continues to develop. 
23
‘‘(3) The internet and other interactive com-
24
puter services offer a forum for a true diversity of 
25
political discourse and viewpoints, unique opportuni-

ties for cultural development, and myriad avenues 
1
for intellectual activity, and regulation of the inter-
2
net must be tailored to supporting those activities. 
3
‘‘(4) The internet and other interactive com-
4
puter services have flourished, to the benefit of all 
5
Americans, with a minimum of government regula-
6
tion, and regulation should be limited to what is nec-
7
essary to preserve the societal benefits provided by 
8
the internet. 
9
‘‘(5) Increasingly Americans rely on internet 
10
platforms and websites for a variety of political, edu-
11
cational, cultural, and entertainment services and for 
12
communication with one another.

‘‘(b) POLICY.—It is the policy of the United States—

‘‘(2) to preserve a vibrant and competitive free 
18
