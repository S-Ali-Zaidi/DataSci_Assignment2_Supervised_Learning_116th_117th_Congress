tives to combating hatred, injustice, and White suprem-
acy. 
Whereas the horrific act of lynching impacted race relations 
in the United States and shaped the geographic, political, 
social, and economic conditions of Black people in ways 
that are still relevant today; 
Whereas more than 4,400 Black people were lynched across 
20 States between 1877 and 1950, 594 of whom were 
Black victims in Georgia and 36 of those documented vic-
tims were killed in Fulton County; 
Whereas, until 1906, Atlanta, Georgia, was home to more 
than 50,000 Black residents, many of whom owned 
homes and businesses in the city; 
Whereas, on September 22, 1906, at 9 p.m., 10,000 White 
men and boys gathered at the corner of Pryor and Deca-
tur Streets, an area known as Five Points in downtown 
Atlanta; 
Whereas the mob was motivated by the media’s false coverage 
of Black men brutalizing White women; 
Whereas city officials, which included Mayor James G. Wood-
ward, attempted to calm the crowds but failed to do so; 
Whereas, going through Decatur Street, Pryor Street, Cen-
tral Avenue, and throughout the central business district, 
assaulting hundreds of Black people, the mob of White 
men and boys continued to hunt and kill Atlanta’s Black 
residents into the night; 
Whereas, in an attempt to control the mob, Mayor Woodward 
called the fire department out to disperse the mob using 
large streams of water, but the mob quickly regathered

and continued to shoot and stone Atlanta’s Black resi-
dents; 
Whereas, by Monday, September 24, 1906, what is now 
known as Downtown Atlanta, was under military rule; 
Whereas the massacre continued, with plans to move outside 
of the city and into Brownsville, a Black community 
south of downtown with about 1,500 residents; 
Whereas the community gathered to prepare and fight back, 
and with great fear of a counterattack they were dis-
armed by State Troops, and more than 250 African- 
American men were arrested; 
Whereas, through the duration of the massacre, armed Black 
residents defended their neighborhoods, both in Browns-
ville and in Dark Town; 
Whereas at least 25 Black residents were murdered, 2 White 
men were killed, hundreds of Black residents were 
wounded, and thousands of Black businesses and homes 
were burned or destroyed; 
Whereas the story of the Atlanta race massacre is only 1 of 
many such atrocities and horrific incidents, and shows 
the lasting impact of White supremacy in the United 
States; and 
Whereas the theft of property from Black landowners as well 
as the displacement caused by the terrorizing of the 
Black community in Atlanta, Georgia, shows how historic 
racism and injustice have significantly contributed to per-
sistent wealth inequality between Black and White Amer-
icans in the United States: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
