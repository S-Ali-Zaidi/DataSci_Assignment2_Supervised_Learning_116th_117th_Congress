Whereas Miken Sports is partially owned by Major League 
Baseball; 
Whereas the Miken Sports plant in Caledonia, Minnesota, 
plans to close their doors and move their bat production 
facility to China, removing the Caledonia community of 
one of their largest employers and economic contributors; 
Whereas Caledonia will consequently face significant eco-
nomic hardship from the loss of one of their largest em-
ployers; 
Whereas Miken Sports is an integral small business in the 
Caledonia, Minnesota, community that employed nearly 
150 people and contributed greatly to the local economy; 
Whereas Major League Baseball has become increasingly ac-
tive in China; 
Whereas, for years, Major League Baseball has benefitted 
greatly due to a unique exemption from Federal antitrust 
law that other professional sports do not have; 
Whereas Major League Baseball has received billions of dol-
lars in taxpayers support and Federal breaks on bonds; 
Whereas in exchange, Major League Baseball should support 
the American economy and not move jobs away from 
American workers to China; 
Whereas prioritizing American jobs and manufacturing helps 
strengthen the economy and reduce the country’s reliance 
on foreign-made products; and 
Whereas moving jobs to China is incompatible with Major 
League Baseball’s position as America’s pastime: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
