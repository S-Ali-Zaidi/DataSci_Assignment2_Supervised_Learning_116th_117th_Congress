SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 2999 IH
(1) Nearly 20,000,000 adults in the United 
1
States require assistance completing self-care and 
2
other daily tasks due to physical, cognitive, develop-
3
mental, or behavioral conditions. This number in-
4
cludes about 17,000,000 individuals living in the 
5
community, 1,500,000 residing in nursing homes, 
6
and nearly 1,000,000 in residential care. The num-
7
ber of people needing this type of assistance is ex-
8
pected to rise as the percentage of the population 
9
that is over age 65 increases dramatically in the 
10
coming decades. 
11
(2) The assistance of direct care workers allows 
12
older individuals and individuals with disabilities to 
13
live with dignity and safety, and to exercise their 
14
right to live independently in their own homes and 
15
communities, in keeping with what is most appro-
16
priate for their needs and preferences. Older individ-
17
uals and individuals with disabilities may also par-
18
ticipate in the direct care workforce, further sup-
19
porting their ability to live independently. 
20
(3) According to PHI, direct care workers pro-
21
vide most of the paid, hands-on care for older indi-
22
viduals and individuals with disabilities. 
23
(4) From 2014 to 2024, home care occupations 
24
are projected to add more jobs than any other single 
25
23:37 Jun 18, 2021
H2999

•HR 2999 IH
occupation, with an additional 633,100 new jobs. 
1
Home care is also among the top 10 fastest-growing 
2
occupations, and with the projected growth in the 
3
population over age 65, this may underestimate the 
4
number of home care workers that will be needed to 
5
provide care for this growing population. 
6
(5) Many direct care workers lack access to a 
7
career pathway or advanced training opportunities. 
8
This limits their ability to build competency and ex-
9
pertise in their field that, when gained, may lead to 
10
an increase in their earning capacity. According to 
11
PHI, more than half of home care workers have 
12
completed no formal education beyond high school, 
13
making high-quality, transferable training essential 
14
to success on the job. 
15
(6) As of 2018, the median wage for direct care 
16
workers is $12.27 per hour and wages and earnings 
17
for home care workers are even lower in rural areas. 
18
Because of low wages, variable work hours, and the 
19
inability to access workplace-based benefits, 44 per-
20
cent of such workers live in low-income households, 
21
and 15 percent of the workers from such households 
22
live below the poverty line. Nearly half of direct care 
23
workers rely on some form of public assistance to 
24
support themselves and their families. 
25

•HR 2999 IH
(7) According to PHI, the direct care workforce 
1
is primarily comprised of low income women and 
2
people of color. Approximately 9 in 10 direct care 
3
workers are women, more than half are women of 
4
color, and one quarter of direct care workers are im-
5
migrants. 
6
(8) The direct care workforce is plagued with 
7
high turnover, low job satisfaction, and workforce 
8
shortages. These conditions can contribute to re-
9
duced quality of care and threaten the availability of 
10
supports for older individuals and individuals with 
11
disabilities. 
12
(9) Because of the nature of the work, direct 
13
care workers suffer from disproportionately high 
14
rates of injury. In 2016, the injury rate for nursing 
15
assistants was 337 per 10,000 as compared to 100 
16
per 10,000 for other occupations. 
17
(10) Training has been shown to reduce worker 
18
turnover, reduce rates of injury, and lead to in-
19
creased job satisfaction. 
20
(11) The Institute of Medicine found that to 
21
ensure that the United States is prepared to meet 
22
the health care needs of older individuals during the 
23
21st century, it is essential that the capacity of the 
24
direct care workforce be enhanced in both the num-
