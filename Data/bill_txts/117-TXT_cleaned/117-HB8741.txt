A BILL 
To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to impose 
a tax on the total revenue of manufacturers and import-
ers of semi-automatic assault weapons. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS. 
3
(a) SHORT TITLE.—This Act may be cited as the 
4
‘‘Firearm Industry Fairness Act’’. 
5
(b) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) AR–15s are abnormally dangerous weapons 
7
meant for the battlefield. AR–15-style rifles have 
8

•HR 8741 IH
been the weapon of choice for the killers responsible 
1
for the deadliest mass shootings in American his-
2
tory, including the recent mass murders in Buffalo, 
3
New York, Uvalde, Texas, and Highland Park, Illi-
4
nois. 
5
(2) Major gun manufacturers have been enjoy-
6
ing record-breaking sales and profits from AR–15- 
7
style rifles, even as gun deaths and mass shootings 
8
have risen in the United States. Studies have shown 
9
that gun violence and the human and economic toll 
10
associated with the more than 40,000 annual fire-
11
arm deaths in America are strongly correlated with 
12
the availability of firearms. 
13
(3) Large capacity magazines have been shown 
14
to lead to increasingly deadly mass shootings be-
15
cause they allow the shooter to continue firing for 
16
longer periods of time and reduce the opportunities 
17
for law enforcement or other bystanders to intervene 
18
to stop the killing. 
19
(4) Despite widespread diversion of weapons 
20
from major manufacturers to unlawful use, the fire-
21
arm industry has failed to monitor the downstream 
22
distribution of their weapons to distributors or other 
23
sellers, with the result that an inordinate number of 
24
03:25 Aug 25, 2022
H8741
3 
•HR 8741 IH
guns used in crimes of violence are funneled through 
1
a small number of dealers. 
2
(5) An investigation into the gun industry’s 
3
practices and profits by the Committee on Oversight 
4
and Reform found that five leading gun manufactur-
5
er’s collected more than $1,000,000,000 from the 
6
sale of AR–15-style weapons in the last decade.
