SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Abortion is an essential health care service 
3
and allows individuals to have full autonomy over 
4
their bodies and their pregnancies, their families, 
5
and their lives. 
6
(2) In 1973, the United States Supreme Court 
7
issued its landmark decision in Roe v. Wade guaran-
8
teeing the constitutional right to abortion. 
9
(3) In the nearly fifty years since the Roe v. 
10
Wade decision, anti-abortion politicians have at-
11
tempted to—and in some cases succeeded in—pass-
12
ing laws to restrict access to abortion. 
13
(4) On May 19, 2021, the Governor of Texas 
14
signed Senate Bill 8 (hereafter referred to as ‘‘S.B. 
15
8’’) into law, which bans abortion care after approxi-
16
mately six weeks of pregnancy—before many people 
17
even know they are pregnant. 
18
(5) The Supreme Court allowed this unconstitu-
19
tional law to go into effect on September 1, 2021, 
20
and remain in place in the following months. 
21
(6) As a result of this law, many Texans have 
22
been forced to travel hundreds of miles and cross 
23
State lines to access constitutionally protected health 
24
care or to carry pregnancies to term against their 
25
will.

(7) Many people who obtain abortions in Texas 
1
are at least six weeks into pregnancy, meaning that 
2
abortion in most instances will be out of reach for 
3
patients for as long as the law is in effect. 
4
(8) S.B. 8 provides a private right of action al-
5
lowing ‘‘any person’’ to sue abortion providers and 
6
‘‘any person’’ who helps a person obtain an abortion 
7
after approximately six weeks of pregnancy or in-
8
tends to do so. 
9
(9) S.B. 8 incentivizes private individuals to sue 
10
by providing that a prevailing plaintiff shall receive 
11
at least $10,000 in damages, as well as costs and at-
12
torney’s fees. 
13
(10) This ban is an attempt to isolate individ-
14
uals seeking abortions in Texas from their commu-
15
nities and critical support networks, discouraging 
16
them from helping for fear of being sued. 
17
(11) Lawmakers in many other states have in-
18
troduced or have voiced their intent to introduce 
19
similar bills. 
20
(12) No one should profit from the restriction 
21
of abortion, or a bounty intended to restrict access 
22
to fundamental reproductive health care.
