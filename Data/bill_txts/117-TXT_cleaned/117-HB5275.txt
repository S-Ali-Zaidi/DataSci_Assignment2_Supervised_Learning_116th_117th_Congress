A BILL 
To establish an independent appeals process relating to as-
signment restrictions at the Department of State, and 
for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Accountability in As-
4
signment Restrictions Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) The Foreign Service Act of 1980 prohibits 
8
the Department of State from discrimination on the 
9

basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, 
1
age, handicapping condition, marital status, geo-
2
graphic or educational affiliation within the United 
3
States, or political affiliation in all personnel actions, 
4
including assignments. 
5
(2) According to a Government Accountability 
6
Office report published in 2020, the Senior Foreign 
7
Service was 69 percent male and 90 percent White. 
8
Meanwhile numerous testimonials have documented 
9
the barriers to advancement faced by non-White 
10
Foreign Service officers (FSOs). 
11
(3) On April 12, 2021, Secretary Blinken ap-
12
pointed a new Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer, 
13
former Ambassador Gina Abercrombie-Winstanley, 
14
reflecting his stated commitment to increasing diver-
15
sity and inclusion at the Department. 
16
(4) According to the Department of State, there 
17
are approximately 1800 employees currently subject 
18
to a practice called assignment restrictions, whereby 
19
they are precluded from working in or on a par-
20
ticular country. The top four countries to which the 
21
restrictions apply are China (196), Russia (184), 
22
Taiwan (84), and Israel (70). 
23
(5) Department of State employees have repeat-
24
edly raised concerns with Congress and the Depart-
25
22:19 Sep 20, 2021

•HR 5275 IH
ment that the practice of assignment restrictions 
1
lacks transparency and accountability, and it may 
2
disproportionately and unfairly affect Asian-Amer-
3
ican employees. 
4
(6) The Department of State lacks an inde-
5
pendent appeals process for assignment restrictions, 
6
preventing affected employees from having their case 
7
reviewed by individuals who were not involved with 
8
the initial decision. 
9
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
10
It is the sense of Congress that— 
11
(1) it is in the foreign policy interest of the 
12
United States to maintain a diplomatic corps that 
13
reflects the diversity of the country and fully utilizes 
14
the cultural and linguistic skills that stem from this 
15
diversity; 
16
(2) the practice of assignment restrictions risks 
17
undermining the Department of State’s stated goals 
18
of promoting diversity and inclusion in its workforce, 
19
while potentially restricting those individuals whose 
20
cultural and linguistic skills can most benefit the 
21
work of United States diplomacy and counterintel-
22
ligence; 
23
(3) the practice of assignment restrictions lim-
24
its the opportunities for promotion and career ad-

•HR 5275 IH
vancement of talented Department of State employ-
1
ees who possess valuable linguistic skills and coun-
2
try-specific knowledge; 
3
(4) the establishment of an independent appeals 
4
process for assignment restrictions, whereby the 
5
panel is not made up by a majority of individuals 
6
from the same bureau that made the initial deter-
7
mination, would help ensure fairness and trans-
8
parency while promoting the goals of inclusion and 
9
diversity within the Department; and 
10
(5) tracking and reporting data on assignment 
11
restrictions, including the race, ethnicity, and na-
12
tional origin of those impacted individuals, will help 
13
ensure that assignment restrictions are not dis-
14
proportionately targeting a particular group or mi-
15
nority at the Department. 
16
SEC. 4. ESTABLISHMENT OF AN INDEPENDENT APPEALS
