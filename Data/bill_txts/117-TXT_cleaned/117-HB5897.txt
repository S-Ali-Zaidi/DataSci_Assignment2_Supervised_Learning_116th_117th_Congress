SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) On May 9, 2013, President Barack Obama 
3
issued Executive Order 13642 (78 Fed. Reg. 28111 
4
(May 14, 2013)), which made open and machine- 
5
readable data the new default for Federal Govern-
6
ment information. 
7
(2) Open data principles are essential for trans-
8
parency and efficiency in government. 
9
(3) In 2012, the Federal Communications Com-
10
mission required television broadcast stations to post 
11
on an online database hosted by the Commission cer-
12
tain materials in the files that those stations are re-
13
quired to maintain and make available for public in-
14
spection, including important information about the 
15
purchasing of political advertisements. In 2016, the 
16
Commission extended the online public inspection 
17
file requirement to providers of cable and satellite 
18
television service, radio broadcast stations, and pro-
19
viders of satellite radio service. 
20
(4) The Commission declined to require those 
21
materials to be machine-readable, deciding at the 
22
time that it was more important to get the informa-
23
tion online faster. 
24
(5) Machine readability is a critical component 
25
of open government and provides interested parties
