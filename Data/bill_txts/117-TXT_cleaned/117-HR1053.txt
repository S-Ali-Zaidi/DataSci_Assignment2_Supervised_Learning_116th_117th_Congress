RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the enduring cultural and historical significance 
of emancipation in the Nation’s capital on the anniver-
sary of President Abraham Lincoln’s signing of the Dis-
trict of Columbia Compensated Emancipation Act, which 
established the ‘‘first freed’’ on April 16, 1862, and 
celebrating passage of the District of Columbia statehood 
bill in the House of Representatives. 
Whereas the District of Columbia has been a focal point of 
the Nation’s complex racial history, which has included 
slavery, the Civil War, brutal and unjustified killings, ra-
cial segregation, and legal disenfranchisement, among 
other violations of civil and human rights;

Whereas, on April 16, 1862, in the midst of the Civil War, 
President Abraham Lincoln signed the District of Colum-
bia Compensated Emancipation Act, which freed the ap-
proximately 3,100 enslaved individuals in the District of 
Columbia and authorized compensation to former enslav-
ers; 
Whereas, on January 1, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln 
issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which established 
a ‘‘new birth of freedom’’ by legally emancipating mil-
lions of enslaved individuals in the 10 States of the Con-
federacy not under Union control, freeing the majority of 
the Nation’s enslaved individuals; 
Whereas the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution of 
the United States, which reads ‘‘Neither slavery nor in-
voluntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime 
whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall 
exist within the United States, or any place subject to 
their jurisdiction. Congress shall have power to enforce 
this article by appropriate legislation’’, was adopted on 
December 6, 1865, and effectively outlawed slavery in the 
United States; 
Whereas the enslavement of persons of African descent en-
dured for more than two centuries in what is now the 
United States, including the District of Columbia; 
Whereas, in 2005, District of Columbia Emancipation Day, 
commemorating April 16, the date of the signing of the 
District of Columbia Compensated Emancipation Act, 
was made a legal public holiday in the District of Colum-
bia to be celebrated annually on April 16;
