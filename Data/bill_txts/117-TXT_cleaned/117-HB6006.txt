SEC. 5. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Advances in technology have led to the cre-
3
ation of digital assets and blockchain technology 
4
that will improve the United States financial system 
5
and create a more fair and equitable structure for 
6
everyday Americans. 
7
(2) The reporting requirements under current 
8
law require digital asset market participants to ad-
9
here to standards that are incompatible with this 
10
technology’s operation. This will hinder the develop-
11
ment of digital assets and its underlying technology 
12
in the United States, shifting its development out-
13
side the United States. 
14
(3) The Chinese Government’s recent ban of 
15
cryptocurrency transactions provides the United 
16
States an opening to further enhance its role as the 
17
leading nation in the development of innovative 
18
blockchain technologies. Providing clear rules for 
19
both consumers and developers of digital assets is 
20
essential to taking advantage of this opportunity. 
21
(4) Miners and validators, hardware and soft-
22
ware developers, and protocol developers are not ac-
23
tual brokers and do not collect or have reason to col-
24
lect the information required under the Infrastruc-
25
ture Investment and Jobs Act.

•HR 6006 IH
(5) It is not in the interest of American tax-
1
payers for Congress to create uncertainty. 
2
(6) Consistent and accurate reporting on digital 
3
asset transactions is necessary. Congress must work 
4
to bring legal and regulatory certainty to the digital 
5
asset industry. Clear rules of the road fosters tech-
6
nology and innovation. 
7
(7) Any amendments made by this Act will not 
8
impact revenue estimated from the Infrastructure 
9
Investment and Jobs Act.
