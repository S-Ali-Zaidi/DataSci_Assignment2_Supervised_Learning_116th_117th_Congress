Whereas families would benefit from bereavement leave from 
work to take care of themselves and their families; 
Whereas people who have experienced pregnancy loss or in-
fant loss should not have their experiences minimized or 
stigmatized; 
Whereas Congress should acknowledge the personal experi-
ences of individuals who have lost a pregnancy or infant 
and empower those individuals to speak about their 
losses; 
Whereas recognizing ‘‘Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remem-
brance Day’’ is an opportunity to increase awareness, 
promote research and greater understanding, and provide

nancy loss or infant loss; and

vent, pregnancy or infant loss: Now, therefore, be it
