A BILL 
To amend title 18, United States Code, to protect pain- 
capable unborn children, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Pain-Capable Unborn 
4
Child Protection Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF 
6
CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY FOR ENACT-
7
MENT. 
8
Congress finds and declares the following: 
9
(1) Pain receptors (nociceptors) are present 
10
throughout the unborn child’s entire body and 
11
nerves link these receptors to the brain’s thalamus 
12
and subcortical plate by no later than 20 weeks after 
13
fertilization. 
14
(2) By 8 weeks after fertilization, the unborn 
15
child reacts to touch. After 20 weeks, the unborn 
16
child reacts to stimuli that would be recognized as 
17
17:16 Mar 12, 2021
H1080

•HR 1080 IH
painful if applied to an adult human, for example, 
1
by recoiling. 
2
(3) In the unborn child, application of such 
3
painful stimuli is associated with significant in-
4
creases in stress hormones known as the stress re-
5
sponse. 
6
(4) Subjection to such painful stimuli is associ-
7
ated with long-term harmful neurodevelopmental ef-
8
fects, such as altered pain sensitivity and, possibly, 
9
emotional, behavioral, and learning disabilities later 
10
in life. 
11
(5) For the purposes of surgery on unborn chil-
12
dren, fetal anesthesia is routinely administered and 
13
is associated with a decrease in stress hormones 
14
compared to their level when painful stimuli are ap-
15
plied without such anesthesia. In the United States, 
16
surgery of this type is being performed by 20 weeks 
17
after fertilization and earlier in specialized units af-
18
filiated with children’s hospitals. 
19
(6) The position, asserted by some physicians, 
20
that the unborn child is incapable of experiencing 
21
pain until a point later in pregnancy than 20 weeks 
22
after fertilization predominately rests on the as-
23
sumption that the ability to experience pain depends 
24
on the cerebral cortex and requires nerve connec-
25
17:16 Mar 12, 2021
H1080
4 
•HR 1080 IH
tions between the thalamus and the cortex. However, 
1
recent medical research and analysis, especially since 
2
2007, provides strong evidence for the conclusion 
3
that a functioning cortex is not necessary to experi-
4
ence pain. 
5
(7) Substantial evidence indicates that children 
6
born missing the bulk of the cerebral cortex, those 
7
with hydranencephaly, nevertheless experience pain. 
8
(8) In adult humans and in animals, stimula-
9
tion or ablation of the cerebral cortex does not alter 
10
pain perception, while stimulation or ablation of the 
11
thalamus does. 
12
(9) Substantial evidence indicates that struc-
13
tures used for pain processing in early development 
14
differ from those of adults, using different neural 
15
elements available at specific times during develop-
16
ment, such as the subcortical plate, to fulfill the role 
17
of pain processing. 
18
(10) The position, asserted by some commenta-
19
tors, that the unborn child remains in a coma-like 
20
sleep state that precludes the unborn child experi-
21
encing pain is inconsistent with the documented re-
22
action of unborn children to painful stimuli and with 
23
the experience of fetal surgeons who have found it 
24
necessary to sedate the unborn child with anesthesia 
25
17:16 Mar 12, 2021
H1080
5 
•HR 1080 IH
to prevent the unborn child from engaging in vig-
1
orous movement in reaction to invasive surgery. 
2
(11) Consequently, there is substantial medical 
3
evidence that an unborn child is capable of experi-
4
encing pain at least by 20 weeks after fertilization, 
5
if not earlier. 
6
(12) It is the purpose of the Congress to assert 
7
a compelling governmental interest in protecting the 
8
lives of unborn children from the stage at which sub-
9
stantial medical evidence indicates that they are ca-
10
pable of feeling pain. 
11
(13) The compelling governmental interest in 
12
protecting the lives of unborn children from the 
13
stage at which substantial medical evidence indicates 
14
that they are capable of feeling pain is intended to 
15
be separate from and independent of the compelling 
16
governmental interest in protecting the lives of un-
17
born children from the stage of viability, and neither 
18
governmental interest is intended to replace the 
19
other. 
20
(14) Congress has authority to extend protec-
21
tion to pain-capable unborn children under the Su-
22
preme Court’s Commerce Clause precedents and 
23
under the Constitution’s grants of powers to Con-
