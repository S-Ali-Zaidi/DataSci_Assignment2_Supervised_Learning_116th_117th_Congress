Whereas the Russian Federation has continuously and in-
creasingly violated the fundamental human rights and 
freedoms enshrined in the Constitution of the Russian 
Federation as well as international law which it is obli-
gated to uphold;

nizations;

sian Duma is considering expanding a law criminalizing

Whereas, on April 16, 2021, the Kremlin designated Alexey 
Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation and his regional

open letter of over 70 Russian charity leaders and philan-
thropists demanding Alexey Navalny be granted access to
