RESOLUTION 
Expressing that the United States is obligated to perma-
nently end the unhoused crisis by 2025 and uphold, 
protect, and enforce the civil and human rights of 
unhoused individuals, including the human rights to 
housing, universal health care, livable wages, education, 
employment opportunities, access to public facilities, free

movement in public spaces, privacy, confidentiality, inter-
net access, vote, freedom from harassment by law en-
forcement, private businesses, property owners, and 
housed residents, and equal rights to health care, legal 
representation, and social services without discrimination 
based on housing status. 
Whereas there are currently between 580,000 and 1,500,000 
unhoused individuals residing in the United States; 
Whereas the population of unhoused individuals in the United 
States is disproportionately comprised of Black, Brown, 
and Indigenous people, women, children, veterans, un-
documented immigrants, people with mental, develop-
mental, and physical disabilities, people with substance 
use disorders, and members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
transgender, gender nonconforming, and queer commu-
nity; 
Whereas Black Americans make up more than 40 percent of 
the unhoused population, but represent 13 percent of the 
general population, and Indigenous people are similarly 
disproportionately overrepresented within the unhoused 
population; 
Whereas children under the age of 18 comprise almost 40 
percent of the total unhoused population in the United 
States; 
Whereas 4,200,000 children and youth experience homeless-
ness each year in the United States; 
Whereas 420,000 children are not connected with a school 
system because of homelessness each year in the United 
States; 
Whereas lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, gender noncon-
forming, and queer individuals, including children, are

forced to accept inappropriate or unsafe accommodations 
to access publicly funded emergency shelters; 
Whereas survivors of domestic violence, partner violence, sex-
ual assault, and stalking are faced with the impossible 
choice of living with an abusive person or becoming 
unhoused due to a lack of an adequate housing safety- 
net; 
Whereas the root causes contributing to the unhoused crisis 
are poverty, a lack of affordable housing options, sys-
temic racism, chronically low wages, underemployment 
and unemployment, gentrification, housing discrimina-
tion, mass incarceration, immigration status, criminaliza-
tion of poverty, domestic violence, discrimination against 
lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, gender noncon-
forming, and queer individuals, trauma, disabilities, per-
sonal and medical debt, a lack of affordable childcare, 
natural disasters, institutionalization, and unexpected 
loss of household income; 
Whereas, in the wake of a deadly global pandemic and a 
compounding economic crisis resulting in massive job 
loss, rates of homelessness and housing insecurity have 
skyrocketed as millions of people across the Nation face 
financial instability, imminent eviction, and the threat of 
becoming unhoused through no fault of their own; 
Whereas the pandemic has significantly increased the number 
of unhoused children and youth due to high unemploy-
ment, unstable living conditions, and job insecurity, leav-
ing millions of children and youth vulnerable to criminal-
ization, exposure to extreme weather, disease, malnutri-
tion, mental and physical disorders, substance use dis-
orders, sex trafficking, kidnapping, physical and sexual 
assault, and premature death;

•HRES 568 IH 
Whereas lack of access to public restrooms, hand-washing fa-
cilities, laundry facilities, showers and garbage removal 
services severely deteriorates overall quality of life and 
greatly increases the chance of unhoused individuals con-
tracting communicable diseases, impacting both housed 
and unhoused communities and threatening public health; 
Whereas health disparities significantly contribute to a bro-
ken social system that creates and maintains poverty and 
the unhoused crisis is a public health crisis, resulting in 
unhoused persons suffering from significantly higher 
rates of chronic health conditions and premature death 
than housed persons, and vastly increasing the spread of 
communicable diseases throughout unhoused and housed 
communities; 
Whereas unhoused persons exhibit higher rates of depression, 
anxiety, psychological distress, physical health problems, 
substance use disorders, and mental trauma than housed 
persons, combined with increased difficulties in accessing 
health services due to a lack of stable living environment, 
functioning communication devices, physical distance, 
knowledge of programs and procedures, among other 
structural barriers, thereby exacerbating the public health 
crisis; 
Whereas inadequate access to healthy, affordable, and fresh 
food options, and severe restrictions on the usage of Sup-
plemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Tem-
porary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and Spe-
cial Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants 
and Children (WIC) benefits fosters conditions of chronic 
malnutrition and food insecurity for unhoused persons, 
particularly youth, significantly weakening their ability to

•HRES 568 IH 
stave off infections and diseases and contributing to 
compounding public health crises; 
Whereas unhoused people lack the necessary stable, safe, and 
supportive environment to heal from illnesses and are 
often prematurely discharged from medical facilities, 
thereby exacerbating existing medical conditions and hin-
dering the recovery and treatment processes; 
Whereas, according to the National Coalition for the Home-
less, human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immuno-
deficiency syndrome and the unhoused crisis are intri-
cately related—as many as 50 percent of people living 
with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immuno-
deficiency syndrome in the United States are at risk of 
becoming unhoused due to high medical costs and health- 
related job loss, and since human immunodeficiency 
virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome targets the 
immune system, unhoused people living with human im-
munodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syn-
drome do not have the ability to fight off disease due to 
factors related to malnutrition, access to hygiene facili-
ties, and exposure to extreme weather conditions; 
Whereas the compounding physical and psychological trauma 
stemming from lack of access to housing, health care, 
safety, food, water, restrooms, showers, laundry facilities, 
electricity, internet, technology, property storage, and lei-
sure, combined with exposure to extreme weather condi-
tions, higher rates of personal violence, including physical 
and sexual assaults endured by unhoused individuals, in-
evitably worsens the mental health of individuals and 
makes it more difficult to access permanent housing, em-
ployment, as well as social, medical, and mental health 
services; 
21:43 Jul 29, 2021

•HRES 568 IH 
Whereas the criminalization of unhoused individuals and 
communities through the creation of State and local ordi-
nances that ban panhandling, loitering, sleeping in tents 
or vehicles, eating in public, and third parties distributing 
food to unhoused people violates the basic human and 
civil rights of unhoused individuals to exist in public 
without fear of law enforcement surveillance, harassment, 
violence, destruction of property, fines, vehicle impound-
ment, or arrest; 
Whereas the vicious cycle of mass incarceration forces people 
to lose employment, homes, student loans, and financial 
assistance, and makes access to housing, gainful employ-
ment, education, and public assistance extraordinarily 
difficult for individuals reentering the community from 
the criminal and juvenile justice systems or with criminal 
records, thereby contributing to higher recidivism rates 
and exacerbating the unhoused crisis; 
Whereas unhoused individuals lack the resources necessary to 
obtain adequate legal representation and are often denied 
relief or damages through courts when they have been 
unfairly targeted by law enforcement officers, private 
businesses, property owners, or housed residents and 
their constitutional rights violated; 
Whereas encampment sweeps, evictions, and cleanups, the re-
moval of outdoor living spaces, or impounding vehicles 
being used as residences exacerbates the complex issues 
faced by unhoused individuals and fails to address the 
lack of affordable and accessible housing options; 
Whereas unhoused people are disproportionately impacted by 
the climate crisis because chronic exposure to climate in-
duced extreme weather and disasters including hurri-
canes, wildfire, freezing temperatures and extreme heat

•HRES 568 IH 
conditions leave unhoused persons susceptible to hypo-
thermia, hyperthermia, frostbite, sunburn, heat exhaus-
tion, and death; 
Whereas hostile architecture and defensive urban design 
transform 
public 
spaces 
into 
impractical 
and 
unwelcoming environments for both housed and unhoused 
communities, by making benches thinner or with arm-
rests to prevent lying down, building bus stops with no 
seating or shelter, deliberate gaps in awnings that allow 
in rain, adding rocks to parks, trails, and highway under-
passes, installing devices that prohibit sitting, or adding 
spikes, rocks, or studs to flat surfaces to render them 
dysfunctional; 
Whereas the Department of Housing and Urban Develop-
ment point-in-time method to count the number of shel-
tered and unsheltered individuals in the United States 
undercounts children, youth and families by not account-
ing for individuals who fall in and out of homelessness 
throughout the year, people who are sheltered with family 
or friends, individuals temporarily residing in hotels, mo-
tels, medical facilities, and jails, and is limited to a count 
one night per year during one of the coldest months; 
Whereas 
inadequate 
statistical 
methods 
for 
counting 
unhoused individuals severely limit the capacity of policy-
makers to develop accurate, data-driven legislation; 
Whereas the long-term solution for ending the unhoused cri-
sis is a housing first approach that provides adequate, ac-
cessible, and affordable permanent housing for unhoused 
individuals, without preconditions and low or no barriers 
to entry, and permanently fosters conditions that prevent 
persons from becoming unhoused;

•HRES 568 IH 
Whereas rates of homelessness have risen for the fourth con-
secutive year, the overburdened repair backlog for public 
housing units is estimated at over $70 billion, and the 
overburdened Tenant-Based ‘‘Section 8’’ Rental Assist-
ance program, also known as a Housing Choice Voucher, 
is not funded by Congress at the level necessary to match 
the ever-increasing demand for housing assistance; 
Whereas emergency shelters, transitional housing programs, 
permanent supportive housing initiatives, and rapid re-
housing programs are inadequately funded and unable to 
keep up with the constant demand to provide adequate 
temporary, transitional, or permanent housing for 
unhoused individuals; 
Whereas the cost of maintaining an unhoused population 
places undue financial burden on taxpayers of an amount 
between $30,000 and $50,000 each year for each chron-
ically unhoused person because of the costs of incarcer-
ation, medical treatments, jails, detention centers, psy-
chiatric and rehabilitation institutions, congregate shelter 
that does not lead to permanent housing, law enforce-
ment costs of encampment cleanups and evictions, and 
the criminalization of unhoused people; 
Whereas there are nearly 17,000,000 vacant homes in the 
United States that are available to house individuals and 
families, and the cost to end the unhoused crisis is at 
least $20,000,000,000, less than 3 percent of the 2021 
fiscal year defense budget of $754,019,000,000; and 
Whereas a lack of political will at the Federal, State, and 
local levels of government drastically restricts the amount 
of funding available for States, counties, cities, and mu-
nicipalities to provide services and resources to unhoused 
communities: Now, therefore, be it
