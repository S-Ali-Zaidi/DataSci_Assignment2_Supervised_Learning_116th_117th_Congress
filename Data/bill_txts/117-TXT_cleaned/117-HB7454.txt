ing institutions and local educational agencies with high

tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Hispanics and Latinos are the largest, 
3
youngest, and second-fastest growing minority popu-
4
lation in the United States, accounting for half of 
5
the Nation’s population growth between 2010 and 
6
2020. 
7
(2) While Hispanics and Latinos compose 18 
8
percent of the population of the United States, they 
9
compose 26 percent of the prekindergarten through 
10
grade 12 public school student enrollment in the 
11
United States. 
12
(3) Over 3,300 local educational agencies have 
13
25 percent or more Hispanic and Latino enrollment 
14
and those local educational agencies enroll 78 per-
15
cent of all prekindergarten through grade 12 His-
16
panic and Latino students in the United States. 
17
(4) Hispanic and Latino students face dispari-
18
ties in educational outcomes, including lower grades, 
19
lower scores on standardized tests, and higher drop-
20
out rates. 
21
(5) Hispanic and Latino students tend to face 
22
greater barriers once in college than their non-His-
23
panic and Latino peers. Seventy percent of Hispanic 
24
and Latino college students are first-generation col-
25
lege students and nearly half of Hispanic and Latino 
26
00:13 Apr 09, 2022

•HR 7454 IH
college students are eligible to receive a Federal Pell 
1
Grant. 
2
(6) Hispanics and Latinos have less access to 
3
enrolling in, or graduating from, institutions of high-
4
er education. 
5
(7) More Hispanics and Latinos are going to 
6
college than ever before, but only slightly more than 
7
half of the Hispanic and Latino students who enroll 
8
earn a bachelor’s degree. 
9
(8) Hispanics and Latinos lag behind non-His-
10
panic Whites, Blacks, and Asian American and Na-
11
tive American Pacific Islanders in educational at-
12
tainment of high school diplomas, associate’s de-
13
grees, and bachelor’s degrees. 
14
(9) In 2019, the median weekly earnings among 
15
high school graduates with no postsecondary degree 
16
were lower than such earnings for individuals hold-
17
ing associate’s degrees by $123, and for individuals 
18
holding bachelor’s degrees by $635. Given this infor-
19
mation, and the growth in the Hispanic and Latino 
20
population relative to the nearly stagnant population 
21
growth of the Nation as a whole, gains in Hispanic 
22
and Latino educational attainment are crucial to 
23
economic gains for the United States.

•HR 7454 IH
(10) Hispanics and Latinos are an increasingly 
1
vital component of the workforce of the United 
2
States. The number of Hispanics and Latinos in the 
3
labor force is expected to grow by approximately 
4
6,900,000 between 2020 and 2030. 
5
(11) To help ensure that the United States is 
6
prepared to meet the needs of its changing work-
7
force, Hispanics and Latinos and the institutions 
8
that enroll them most, Hispanic-serving institutions, 
9
must be afforded the resources and support nec-
10
essary to close the achievement and opportunity 
11
gaps.
