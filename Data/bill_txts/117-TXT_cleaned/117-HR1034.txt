RESOLUTION 
Supporting the goals and ideals of Mathematics and 
Statistics Awareness Month. 
Whereas mathematical and statistical research is ongoing, re-
vealing new results and applications every day in fields 
such as medicine, cybersecurity, manufacturing, energy, 
biotechnology, and business; 
Whereas mathematics and statistics are important drivers of 
innovation in our technical world; 
Whereas education in the mathematical and statistical 
sciences is foundational and serves as a connecting fabric 
for all advances in science and engineering;

Whereas science and engineering are becoming increasingly 
computational and data-based, extending the need for 
quantitative, statistical, and computational skills to all 
fields; 
Whereas advances in mathematical and statistical sciences 
enable understanding of complex systems and design of 
new technology, with implications for societal challenges 
in health, defense, energy, transportation, and other 
areas; 
Whereas Mathematics and Statistics Awareness Month began 
in 1986 as Mathematics Awareness Week with a procla-
mation by President Ronald Reagan; 
Whereas Mathematics and Statistics Awareness Month is now 
held each year in April with the goal to increase public 
understanding of and appreciation for the mathematical 
and statistical sciences; 
Whereas participation by United States women, African 
Americans, American Indians or Alaska natives, and His-
panics or Latinos as percentages of PhD recipients in the 
mathematical sciences have persistently been out of step 
with national demographics, 28 percent, 3 percent, 0.5 
percent, and 3.5 percent, respectively, over the years 
2005–2020 in comparison with 51 percent, 13 percent, 
1.3 percent, and 18.5 percent in the general population 
for the same period; 
Whereas the sponsors of Mathematics and Statistics Aware-
ness Month are working together to transform the mathe-
matical and statistical sciences workforce through greater 
inclusion of women and underrepresented minorities; 
Whereas a more diverse mathematical sciences workforce 
would enhance the mathematical sciences and also ad-

vance the national security and economic interests of the 
country; 
Whereas the sponsors of Mathematics and Statistics Aware-
ness Month are working together to maintain the United 
States global preeminence in the mathematics and statis-
tics; 
Whereas engaging young students, parents, and educators in 
hands-on activities inspires future generations of talent in 
the mathematical and statistical sciences; 
Whereas Mathematics and Statistics Awareness Month activi-
ties are organized across the country by college and uni-
versity departments, institutional public information of-
fices, student groups, and related associations and inter-
est groups and include a wide variety of workshops, com-
petitions, exhibits, festivals, lectures, and symposia; and 
Whereas April is designated as Mathematics and Statistics 
Awareness Month, to celebrate mathematics and statis-
tics and the diverse researchers and students in these 
fields who are contributing so much to furthering discov-
eries and solving global problems: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the goals and ideals of Mathe-
2
matics and Statistics Awareness Month to increase 
3
the visibility of mathematics and statistics as fields 
4
of study and to communicate the myriad benefits of 
5
education in mathematics and statistics; 
6
(2) recognizes that mathematics and statistics 
7
underpin all of the STEM disciplines (science, tech-
8
nology, engineering, and mathematics), which are
