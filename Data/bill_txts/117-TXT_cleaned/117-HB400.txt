SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Civics Learning Act 
2
of 2021’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) The dearth of civics lessons available to stu-
6
dents across the United States has helped to foster 
7
a political climate that is deeply partisan and di-
8
vided. 
9
(2) Polarized party politics in the United States 
10
has fractured public morale in our institutions and 
11
has created an environment in which people are less 
12
likely to be well-informed on the current state of af-
13
fairs and to participate in the political process. 
14
(3) According to the Annenberg Constitution 
15
Day Civics Survey conducted by the Annenberg Pub-
16
lic Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania— 
17
(A) in 2018, only 32 percent of people in 
18
the United States surveyed were capable of 
19
naming all 3 branches of Government, while 33 
20
percent of Americans were not able to name 
21
any of the branches of government; 
22
(B) in 2018, 30 percent of people in the 
23
United States surveyed knew that the Senate is 
24
in charge of Supreme Court nominee confirma-
25
tions; and 
26

•HR 400 IH
(C) in 2017, 37 percent could not name 
1
any of the rights guaranteed under the First 
2
Amendment. 
3
(4) In 2014, only 23 percent of eighth graders 
4
were found to have performed at or above the pro-
5
ficient level on the National Assessment of Edu-
6
cational Progress civics exam conducted by the Na-
7
tional Center of Education Studies. 
8
(5) A lack of knowledge on the basics of the 
9
structure of our democratic republic creates an in-
10
creasingly ill-prepared electorate which over time 
11
has, and will continue to, contribute to a weakened 
12
democracy.
