SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) The United States capital markets are so-
8
phisticated, complex, diverse, and highly inter-
9
connected interstate marketplaces that effect and

process millions of trades daily for the benefit of in-
1
dividual and institutional investors throughout the 
2
United States, including the retirement accounts of 
3
union members, pensioners, teachers, policemen, 
4
firemen, first responders, and other working Ameri-
5
cans, as well as the endowments of colleges and uni-
6
versities and charitable organizations. 
7
(2) The United States capital markets are the 
8
deepest, most liquid markets in the world in large 
9
measure because of the low transaction costs that in-
10
vestors pay to trade securities. 
11
(3) Under the Federal securities laws, the Secu-
12
rities and Exchange Commission serves as the pri-
13
mary supervisor and regulator of the United States 
14
capital markets (with the assistance of other Federal 
15
regulators), while under State securities laws, State 
16
regulators serve a secondary function of helping to 
17
protect investors with respect to securities offered 
18
and sold within their States. 
19
(4) Also pursuant to the Federal securities 
20
laws, Congress directs the Securities and Exchange 
21
Commission to assess transaction fees upon the 
22
United States capital markets that are designed to 
23
recover the Commission’s costs of supervising and 
24
regulating the United States capital markets.

(5) Some States have proposed taxes and fees 
1
that are based on securities transactions and proc-
2
essing activity related thereto from investors from 
3
other States and would raise costs for all United 
4
States investors, even investors outside of the States

levying the taxes and fees.
