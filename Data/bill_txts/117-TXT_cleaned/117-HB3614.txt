A BILL

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Menstrual Equity For 
4
All Act of 2021’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Menstrual products are a necessity each 
8
month for millions of individuals across the United 
9
States. 
10
(2) More than half of the United States popu-
11
lation will likely menstruate every month for decades 
12
of their lives. 
13
(3) This lack of menstrual products, often 
14
called ‘‘period poverty’’, can adversely affect an indi-
15
vidual’s health and well-being. 
16
(4) Period poverty exacerbates the vicious cycle 
17
of poverty by further marginalizing individuals who 
18
menstruate, causing them to withdraw from daily 
19
life, forego pay, or miss educational opportunities.

(5) Period poverty existed long before the 
1
COVID–19 pandemic. 
2
(6) The COVID–19 pandemic has forced mil-
3
lions of individuals out of work, thereby exacerbating 
4
the socioeconomic and health challenges of individ-
5
uals facing period poverty. 
6
(7) Addressing period poverty is essential to en-
7
suring educational equity for diverse populations. 
8
(8) Studies have shown that 1 in 4 women and 
9
girls reports struggling to afford menstrual prod-
10
ucts. 
11
(9) Studies have shown that 1 in 10 college stu-
12
dents in the United States are affected by period 
13
poverty. 
14
(10) Period poverty disproportionately affects 
15
Black, Latina, immigrant, and first-generation stu-
16
dents at higher rates than other cohorts. 
17
(11) Individuals living in period poverty are 
18
more likely to experience depression than individuals 
19
with access to period products. 
20
(12) Period poverty can increase the risk of in-
21
fections due to— 
22
(A) the use of substitutes for menstrual 
23
products (such as paper towels or toilet paper); 
24
and
