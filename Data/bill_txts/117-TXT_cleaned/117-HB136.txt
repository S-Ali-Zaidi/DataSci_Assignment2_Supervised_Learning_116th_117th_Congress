(2) Almost 13,000,000 people report having an 
1
asthma attack in the past year and asthma accounts

for nearly 2,000,000 emergency department visits 
3
each year.

(3) Every day in the United States— 
5
(A) 30,000 people have an asthma attack; 
6
and 
7
(B) 11 people die from asthma. 
8
(4) Nearly 5,000,000 asthma sufferers are 
9
under 18 years of age, and 1 out of every 10 school- 
10
aged children has asthma. 
11
(5) Minorities are adversely affected by asthma, 
12
as— 
13
(A) African Americans are 3 times more 
14
likely to die from asthma; and 
15
