SEC. 2. STUDY ON RADIATION EXPOSURE RELATING TO 
1
CLEANUP OF ENEWETAK ATOLL. 
2
(a) STUDY.—The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall 
3
seek to enter into an agreement with the National Acad-
4
emies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to conduct 
5
a study on the level of radiation exposure experienced by 
6
members of the Armed Forces who participated in the 
7
cleanup of Enewetak Atoll during the period beginning on 
8
January 1, 1977, and ending on December 31, 1980. 
9
(b) MATTERS INCLUDED.—The study conducted pur-
10
suant to subsection (a) shall include the following: 
11
(1) An evaluation of— 
12
(A) the completeness and adequacy of the 
13
assessment titled ‘‘Radiation Dose Assessment 
14
for Military Personnel of the Enewetak Atoll 
15
Cleanup Project (1977–1980)’’ published by the 
16
Defense Threat Reduction Agency in April 
17
2018, including with respect to the calculation 
18
of the estimated upper-bound radiation dose re-
19
ceived by members of the Armed Forces who 
20
participated in the cleanup of Enewetak Atoll 
21
during the period beginning on January 1, 
22
1977, and ending on December 31, 1980; 
23
(B) whether information exists to conduct 
24
a revised or alternative radiation dose assess-
25
ment that would consider exposures and expo-

sure pathways that were not part of the radi-
1
ation dose assessment described in subpara-
2
graph (A); and 
3
(C) whether conducting such a revised or 
4
alternative radiation dose assessment is feasible 
5
and would likely yield substantively improved 
6
estimates of the radiation dose received by 
7
members of the Armed Forces who participated 
8
in the cleanup of Enewetak Atoll. 
9
(2) If the study determines under paragraph 
10
(1)(C) that a revised or alternative radiation dose 
11
assessment is feasible and would likely yield sub-
12
stantively improved estimates of the radiation dose 
13
received by members of the Armed Forces who par-
14
ticipated in the cleanup of Enewetak Atoll, an eval-
15
uation of conducting such assessment, including— 
16
(A) identification of the sources of the data 
17
for such assessment, including a delineation of 
18
the protocol to be used in conducting such as-
19
sessment; 
20
(B) an estimate of the time and funding 
21
needed to conduct such assessment; 
22
(C) identification of the major sources of 
23
uncertainty in such assessment and how such 
24

sources may affect the estimates generated by 
1
such assessment; and 
2
(D) identification of the best means to 
3
carry out such assessment. 
4
(c) REPORT.—Not later than 90 days after the date 
5
on which the Secretary receives the study conducted pur-
6
suant to subsection (a), the Secretary shall submit to the 
7
Committees on Veterans’ Affairs of the House of Rep-
8
resentatives and the Senate a report on such study, includ-
9
ing the plans of the Secretary to carry out any actions 
10
based on the results of such study.
