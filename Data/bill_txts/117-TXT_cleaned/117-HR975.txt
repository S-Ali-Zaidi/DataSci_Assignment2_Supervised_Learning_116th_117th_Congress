RESOLUTION 
Expressing the mental health impacts of recurrent climate- 
related disasters on youth. 
Whereas there is a significant, negative impact that rapid 
and ongoing climate change has on America’s youth; 
Whereas youth are especially vulnerable to the physical and 
mental health impacts of climate-related disasters and 
the cumulative toll youth will endure from additional ex-
posure to increasing climate-related disasters; 
Whereas youth represent a particularly vulnerable group be-
cause greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere will 
impact today’s and tomorrow’s youth throughout their bi-
ological, psychological, academic, and social development; 
Whereas 
an 
American 
Psychological 
Association 
and 
ecoAmerica report stated that, as of 2016, as climate-re-

lated disasters continue to increase, more youth will be 
directly affected by increasing rates of stress and trauma 
through interruption in schooling, disruptions in routine, 
separation from caregivers due to evacuations or displace-
ment, and parental stress after a disaster; 
Whereas recent studies cited in the American Psychological 
Association and ecoAmerica report have documented that 
high levels of stress during childhood, such as those asso-
ciated with the experience of a climate-related disaster or 
displacement, can affect the development of neural path-
ways in ways that impair memory, executive function, 
and decision making in later life; 
Whereas a 2016 Social Science & Medicine study found that 
experiencing an extreme weather event before age 5 re-
sulted in higher levels of anxiety and depression among 
adults; 
Whereas studies document that many young people are grap-
pling with the impact of climate change; 
Whereas recent studies confirm those from low-income com-
munities, indigenous communities, and communities of 
color are often the most vulnerable to the worst impacts 
of climate change, such as flooding, drought, fire, and ex-
treme heat; 
Whereas a study by the American Public Health Association 
and ecoAmerica, Making the Connection: Climate 
Changes Mental Health, shows that up to 45 percent of 
youth have developed depression after a climate-related 
disaster, affecting both their caregivers and the youth 
themselves;

Whereas a National Library of Medicine study found an asso-
ciation between increases in pediatric psychiatrist visits 
and polluted air from wildfires; 
Whereas there are direct links between fine particulate mat-
ter (PM 2.5) exposure and neuropsychological effects, 
such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, de-
creased memory, depleted academic performance, and au-
tism; 
Whereas, according to a 2017 report by the Lancet Planetary 
Health Journal, The Impact of Climate Change on Youth 
Depression and Mental Health, an increase in emergency 
department visits was incited by higher levels of humidity 
and rising temperatures; 
Whereas, in 2021, 64 percent of Americans lived in places 
that experienced a multiday heat wave, considered the 
most dangerous form of climate-related disaster and the 
frequency and intensity of climate-related disasters is in-
creasing exponentially; 
Whereas a 2019 report suggested that as the frequency of 
heat waves increases due to the climate crisis, school- 
based outdoor recreational opportunities for youth that 
benefit mental and physical well-being will be curtailed by 
extreme heat; 
Whereas, in 2020, a poll from the Washington Post-Kaiser 
Family Foundation found that 57 percent of teenagers 
stated they were frightened by climate change, while 52 
percent were angered by it and a mere 29 percent of 
youth were optimistic for the future in regards to climate 
change; 
Whereas, according to a 2021 study surveying over 10,000 
youth, 45 percent of respondents reported that thoughts

of climate change have affected their daily lives and abili-
ties negatively; 
Whereas, in 2021, The National Association of School Psy-
chologists, representing more than 25,000 members, de-
clared the need to increase awareness of the harmful ef-
fects of climate change on youth, increase resources, and 
advocate for climate justice; 
Whereas the American Psychological Association has issued a 
report stating that children are among those facing the 
greatest impacts of climate change; and 
Whereas the National Scientific Council on the Developing 
Child has concluded that children and youth are better 
off during adversity if they also have the help of noncare-
giver role models, such as teachers or coaches: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—

(1) shall take effective action on climate

change, guided by the science provided in the 2021
