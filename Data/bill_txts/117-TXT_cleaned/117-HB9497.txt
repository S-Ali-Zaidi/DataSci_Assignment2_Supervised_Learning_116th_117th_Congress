SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress makes the following findings: 
9
(1) An estimated one out of every three women 
10
throughout the world will be beaten, coerced into 
11
sex, or otherwise abused in her lifetime.

(2) Up to 70 percent of women in some coun-
1
tries report experiencing gender-based violence at 
2
some point in their lives. 
3
(3) Intimate partner violence is the most preva-
4
lent form of violence against women, preventing 
5
them from playing more active roles in the social, 
6
economic, and political development of their commu-
7
nities. 
8
(4) Sexual violence among adolescents and pre- 
9
adolescents is alarmingly high. National surveys in 
10
Swaziland, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Kenya, and Haiti 
11
have found that between 28 and 38 percent of girls 
12
and between 9 and 18 percent of boys report experi-
13
encing sexual violence before reaching 18 years of 
14
age. 
15
(5) Adult male respondents in six countries who 
16
had experienced violence as children were signifi-
17
cantly more likely to report perpetrating intimate 
18
partner violence themselves according to the Inter-
19
national Men and Gender Equality Survey dataset. 
20
Analysis by the International Center for Research on 
21
Women further shows that men who witnessed vio-
22
lence against their mothers are consistently and sig-
23
nificantly more likely to report perpetrating sexual 
24
violence. Further, sexually aggressive behaviors start 
25

•HR 9497 IH
young for these men, and overlap significantly with 
1
other forms of physical violence. 
2
(6) Gender-based violence harms economies and 
3
the workers that fuel them. Despite under-reporting, 
4
striking statistics document prevalent forms of gen-
5
der-based violence globally that affect the world of 
6
work. Worldwide, women are concentrated in low- 
7
wage, insecure jobs in workplaces where they lack 
8
bargaining power, protections against gender-based 
9
violence, safe and confidential reporting systems, re-
10
course to justice, and access to legal, medical, and 
11
psychosocial services. 
12
(7) Women living in poverty are particularly 
13
vulnerable to gender-based violence. Lack of eco-
14
nomic opportunities often compel women to use des-
15
perate and dangerous means to provide for them-
16
selves and their families, risking significant exposure 
17
to sexual exploitation and abuse. These women often 
18
cannot afford critical social and medical services. 
19
(8) Research conducted in India, Colombia, 
20
South Africa, and Uganda indicates that when 
21
women have greater control of assets, they are less 
22
likely to experience intimate partner violence. Addi-
23
tionally, when women participate in the economy, 
24
they are able to develop a wider support network, 
25
23:14 Dec 21, 2022
H9497

•HR 9497 IH
which allows them to more easily escape intimate 
1
partner violence. 
2
(9) Gender-based violence impacts livelihoods 
3
and food security by reducing work capacity and 
4
productivity, including the ability to grow food for 
5
consumption. Studies have shown that women af-
6
fected by gender-based violence are exposed to ill-
7
nesses and injuries that hamper their ability to work 
8
productively and care for their families. Diminished 
9
food production consequently increases hunger and 
10
women’s vulnerability to further violence. 
11
(10) Country studies indicate that the risk of 
12
HIV among women who have experienced violence 
13
may be up to three times higher than among those 
14
who have not experienced violence. The World 
15
Health Organization found that women who experi-
16
ence intimate partner violence are at more than 50 
17
percent greater risk of HIV infection, and in some 
18
instances their risk of HIV infection increases four- 
19
fold. Women living with HIV are more likely to ex-
20
perience violence than other women, and fear of vio-
21
lence can prevent women from accessing HIV/AIDS 
22
information and receiving treatment and counseling. 
23
(11) Addressing gender norms and inequities is 
24
essential to reducing HIV risk and increasing access 
25

•HR 9497 IH
to HIV prevention, care, and treatment services for 
1
women and men. 
2
(12) Prevalence of sexual and physical violence 
3
is higher among persons with disabilities, particu-
4
larly for adolescents and intimate partners with dis-
5
abilities, and for men and women with intellectual 
6
impairments living in institutions. The World Health 
7
Organization reports that rates of gender-based vio-
8
lence are between 4 and 10 times greater among 
9
persons with disabilities compared to non-disabled 
10
persons. 
11
(13) Displaced, refugee, and stateless women 
12
and girls in humanitarian emergencies, conflict set-
13
tings, and natural disasters face extreme violence 
14
and threats, including— 
15
(A) being forced to exchange sex for food 
16
and humanitarian supplies; and 
17
(B) being at increased risk of rape, sexual 
18
exploitation, and abuse. 
19
(14) Rape and sexual assault against women 
20
and girls are used to torture, intimidate, and ter-
21
rorize communities. Rape and sexual assault are 
22
used as tools of war in conflict zones, including the 
23
Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iraq, Syria, Af-
24
ghanistan, El Salvador, and South Sudan. UNFPA,

agency, leads the Gender Based Violence Area of 
2
Responsibility, which is responsible for global coordi-
3

4
sponse in humanitarian settings and is a leading 
5
provider of post-rape care and other reproductive 
6
health services and commodities in humanitarian 
7
settings. 
8
(15) Child and forced marriage of girls— 
9
(A) is a harmful practice that deprives 
10
girls of their dignity and rights and creates bar-
11
riers to development for communities and coun-
12
tries; 
13
(B) is projected to affect more than 
14
150,000,000 girls who will become brides be-
15
tween 2019 and 2030; 
16
(C) can prematurely end girls’ education, 
17
increase vulnerability to gender-based violence, 
18
and significantly raise the risk of maternal and 
19
infant morbidity or mortality, including the risk 
20
of obstetric fistula and sexually transmitted dis-
21
eases, including HIV/AIDS; 
22
(D) is perpetuated by poverty, a lack of 
23
educational or employment opportunities for 
24
girls, a lack of legal policies and enforcement of 
25

H9497

•HR 9497 IH
laws, and religious, cultural, and social factors 
1
related to girls’ perceived lack of value, factors 
2
which become particularly acute in conflict and 
3
disaster settings where fears of sexual violence 
4
and overstretched coping mechanisms often 
5
drive child and forced marriage; and 
6
(E) child marriage is estimated to con-
7
tribute, on average, to a loss in earnings of 
8
about nine percent for women who married 
9
early, which translates into a loss of about one 
10
percent in earnings for the entire labor force 
11
when factoring in all working adults. 
12
(16) Female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/ 
13
C) is carried out most often on girls between infancy 
14
and 15 years of age and has impacted more than 
15
200,000,000 girls and women who are alive today. 
16
FGM/C can cause long-term health problems, includ-
17
ing infertility, complications in childbirth, and in-
18
creased risk of newborn deaths. Mental health is one 
19
of the least explored domains of impact of gender- 
20
based violence; indeed, self-harm and suicide is the 
21
leading cause of death globally for adolescent girls 
22
aged 15–19. 
23
(17) World Bank data shows that gender in-
24
equality directly corresponds to increased levels of 
25
23:14 Dec 21, 2022
H9497

•HR 9497 IH
political and economic instability within states. Gen-
1
der-based violence impedes women’s meaningful par-
2
ticipation in social, political, and economic spheres, 
3
which is essential to the stability and democratiza-
4
tion of a country. Since women disproportionately 
5
experience gender-based violence during conflict and 
6
post-conflict reconstruction, they can play a pivotal 
7
role in preventing, mitigating, and resolving conflict, 
8
and countering extremism. 
9
(18) Gender-based violence is a contributing 
10
factor to human trafficking. Experts in the field 
11
have reported that women and girls who have experi-
12
enced gender-based violence and live in societies that 
13
tolerate severe gender discrimination appear to be 
14
more vulnerable to being trafficked. Comprehensive 
15
efforts to reduce human trafficking must include ef-
16
forts to prevent and respond to gender-based vio-
17
lence due to the intertwined relationship of the two 
18
crimes. 
19
(19) Health services are among the first places 
20
survivors of violence seek assistance. Health focused 
21
nongovernmental organizations and United Nations 
22
agencies like UNFPA, the Reproductive Health and 
23
Rights Agency, has critical opportunities to reach af-
24
fected women and girls.

H9497

•HR 9497 IH
(20) Gender-based violence also manifests on-
1
line; gender-based cyberviolence is a growing con-
2
cern, with women and girls disproportionately af-
3
fected and targeted based on their appearance, activ-
4
ism and sexuality. 
5
(21) Taking meaningful action to address gen-
6
der-based violence is an imperative acknowledgment 
7
of a woman’s agency and personal right to leading 
8
a dignified life. 
9
(22) Addressing gender norms and inequities is 
10
essential to reducing HIV risk and increasing access 
11
to HIV prevention, care, and treatment services for 
12
women and men.
