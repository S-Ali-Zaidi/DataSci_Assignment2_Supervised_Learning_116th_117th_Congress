A BILL 
To direct the Director of National Intelligence to submit 
to Congress a report relating to analyses of the military 
will to fight and the national will to fight with respect 
to the Governments of Ukraine, Afghanistan, and Iraq, 
and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Will to Fight Act of 
4
2022’’. 
5
SEC. 2. REPORT ON ASSESSING WILL TO FIGHT. 
6
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:

2 
•HR 8560 IH
(1) According to a study by the RAND corpora-
1
tion, ‘‘will to fight’’ is poorly analyzed and the least 
2
understood aspect of war. 
3
(2) In testimony before the Select Committee 
4
on Intelligence of the Senate in May 2022, top intel-
5
ligence officials of the United States indicated that 
6
although the intelligence community accurately an-
7
ticipated Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the intel-
8
ligence community did not accurately assess the will 
9
of Ukrainian forces to fight in opposition to a Rus-
10
sian invasion or that the Ukrainian forces would 
11
succeed in averting a rapid Russian military occupa-
12
tion of Kyiv. 
13
(3) According to the RAND corporation, the in-
14
telligence community estimated that the Afghan gov-
15
ernment’s forces could hold out against the Taliban 
16
for as long as 2 years if all ground forces of the 
17
United States were withdrawn. This estimate was 
18
revised in June 2021 to reflect an intelligence com-
19
munity view that Afghanistan’s military collapse 
20
could come in 6 to 12 months. In August 2021, the 
21
Afghan government fell within days after the ground 
22
forces of the United States were withdrawn. 
23
(4) Similarly, the rapid advance of the Islamic 
24
State in Iraq and Syria and near-total collapse of 
25

•HR 8560 IH
the Iraqi Security Forces in 2014 appeared to take 
1
the policymakers of the United States by surprise. 
2
(5) The apparent gaps in these analyses had 
3
important implications for policy decisions of the 
4
United States toward Russia and Afghanistan, and 
5
suggest a need for further examination of how the 
6
intelligence community assesses a foreign military’s 
7
will to fight. 
8
(b) REPORT.—Not later than 180 days after the date 
9
of the enactment of this Act, the Director of National In-
10
telligence, acting through the National Intelligence Coun-
11
cil, and in coordination with the heads of the elements of 
12
the intelligence community that the Director determines 
13
appropriate, shall submit to the appropriate congressional 
14
committees a report examining the extent to which anal-
15
yses of the military will to fight and the national will to 
16
fight informed the all-source analyses of the intelligence 
17
community regarding how the armed forces and Govern-
18
ments of Ukraine, Afghanistan, and Iraq would perform 
19
at key junctures. 
20
(c) ELEMENTS.—The report under subsection (b) 
21
shall include the following: 
22
(1) The methodology of the intelligence commu-
23
nity for measuring the military will to fight and the 
24
national will to fight of a foreign country.

•HR 8560 IH
(2) The extent to which analysts of the intel-
1
ligence community applied such methodology when 
2
assessing the military will to fight and the national 
3
will to fight of— 
4
(A) Afghanistan following the April 2021 
5
announcement of the full withdrawal of the 
6
United States Armed Forces; 
7
(B) Iraq in the face of the rapid emergence 
8
and advancement in 2014 of Islamic State in 
9
Iraq and Syria; and 
10
(C) Ukraine and Russia during the initial 
11
phase of the invasion and march toward Kyiv 
12
by Russia in February 2022. 
13
(3) The extent to which— 
14
(A) the assessments described in para-
15
graph (2) depended on the observations of per-
16
sonnel of the United States Armed Forces who 
17
had trained Afghan, Iraqi, and Ukrainian 
18
armed forces; and 
19
(B) such observations reflected any stand-
20
ardized, objective methodology. 
21
(4) Whether shortcomings in assessing the mili-
22
tary will to fight and the national will to fight may 
23
have affected the capacity of the intelligence commu-

nity to provide ‘‘early warning’’ about the collapse of 
1
government forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
2
(5) The extent to which ‘‘red teaming’’ was 
3
used to test the assessments described in paragraph 
4
(2). 
5
(6) The extent to which dissenting opinions of 
6
intelligence analysts were highlighted in final written 
7
products presented to senior policymakers of the 
8
United States. 
9
(7) The extent to which analysts and super-
10
visors adhered to the policies, procedures, directives, 
11
and best practices of the intelligence community. 
12
(8) Recommendations for analyses by the intel-
13
ligence community going forward to incorporate les-
14
sons learned and enhance the quality of future ana-
15
lytical products to more accurately reflect the mili-
16
tary will to fight and the national will to fight and 
17
improve the capacity of the intelligence community 
18
to accurately predict the success or failure of the 
19
armed forces of a foreign country.

21
section (b) to the congressional intelligence committees,
