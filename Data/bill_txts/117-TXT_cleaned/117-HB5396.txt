Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

(1992), and Davis v. Monroe County Board of Edu-
1
cation, 526 U.S. 629, 633 (1999), covered entities 
2
are liable for harassment on the basis of sex under 
3
their education programs and activities under title 
4
IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (20 
5
U.S.C. 12681 et seq.) (referred to in this Act as 
6
‘‘title IX’’). 
7
(2) As courts have properly recognized, experi-
8
encing the effects of sexual harassment under an 
9
education program or activity, whether perpetrated 
10
by employees or agents of the program or activity, 
11
by peers of the victim, or by others, can be a form 
12
of unlawful and intentional discrimination that in-
13
flicts substantial harm on beneficiaries of the pro-
14
gram or activity and violates the obligation of a cov-
15
ered entity to maintain a nondiscriminatory environ-
16
ment. 
17
(3) Title IX protects persons, of any gender, 
18
from discrimination on the basis of sex in education 
19
programs and activities that receive Federal funding. 
20
Supreme Court opinions have established that under 
21
title IX, schools are responsible for addressing sex-
22
ual harassment, regardless of the location of the 
23
harassment, when it impacts a person’s access to an 
24
educational program or activity.

(4) Perpetrators of sexual harassment and vio-
1
lence at school are not limited to students. Incidents 
2
have also involved faculty, administrators, coaches, 
3
and other staff members. 
4
(5) A school culture that tolerates inappropriate 
5
verbal and physical contact and that intentionally or 
6
unintentionally discourages reporting these behaviors 
7
undermines the emotional, intellectual, and profes-
8
sional growth of millions of young people. 
9
(6) Sexual harassment of students, especially 
10
among women and girls, students of color, disabled 
11
students, and LGBTQ students, is widely prevalent 
12
in K–12 and higher education, for example: 
13
(A) One in 5 girls ages 14 through 18 
14
have been kissed or touched without their con-
15
sent, 58 percent of LGBTQ youth ages 13 
16
through 21 are sexually harassed, and children 
17
with disabilities are 2.9 times more likely than 
18
their peers to be sexually assaulted. 
19
(B) Historically marginalized and under-
20
represented groups are more likely to experi-
21
ence sexual harassment than their peers, with 
22
Native American, Black, and Latina girls being 
23
more likely than White girls to be forced to 
24
have sex when they do not want to do so.

(C) In college, 1 in 4 women, 1 in 15 men, 
1
and 1 in 4 transgender, nonbinary, and gender- 
2
nonconforming students are sexually assaulted 
3
during their time as undergraduates. 
4
(D) One in 3 college women and 1 in 6 col-
5
lege men are survivors of dating violence or do-
6
mestic violence. 
7
(7) Few students report harassment to their 
8
schools, often because of shame or self-blame, fear 
9
of retaliation, fear of being ignored or disciplined, 
10
fear of police or immigration officials, or lack of 
11
knowledge of services schools can offer to help. 
12
(8) Failure to meaningfully enforce title IX 
13
leads to discrimination by creating a hostile learning 
14
environment that impedes educational attainment, 
15
damages rights to equal access to education, and un-
16
dermines learning for all. 
17
(9) When schools fail to protect survivors, in-
18
cluding by offering supportive measures that are de-
19
signed to preserve and to restore their equal access 
20
to education, survivors often suffer in the form of 
21
lower academic achievement, lost scholarships, and 
22
lost degrees.

on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Ac-
1
tivities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance’’ (85 
2
Fed. Reg. 30026, May 19, 2020) have made it more 
3
difficult for student survivors to report harassment 
4
and receive help and pose uniquely burdensome pro-
5
cedures for cases of sexual harassment that are not 
6
required for any other type of student or staff mis-
7
conduct, only further sweeping sexual violence under 
8
the rug. 
9
(11) Title IX’s language is broad and sweeping, 
10
making clear Congress’ intent to open the court-
11
house doors to victims of a wide range of sex dis-
12
crimination in schools. However, since title IX’s pas-
13
sage, courts have created barriers that make it ex-
14
traordinarily difficult for survivors to obtain redress 
15
from schools through private litigation. 
16
(12) In a 5 to 4 opinion in Gebser v. Lago 
17
Vista Independent School District, 524 U.S. 274 
18
(1998), the Supreme Court held that students sub-
19
jected to sexual harassment may receive a damages 
20
remedy under title IX only when school officials have 
21
‘‘actual notice’’ of the harassment and are ‘‘delib-
22
erately indifferent’’, or respond in a clearly unrea-
23
sonable manner, to it.

(13) Although they do not affect the relevant 
1
standards for individuals to obtain injunctive and 
2
equitable relief for harassment on the basis of race, 
3
color, sex, national origin, age, or disability under 
4
covered programs and activities, Gebser and similar 
5
opinions severely limit the availability of remedies 
6
for such individuals by imposing new, more stringent 
7
standards for recovery of damages under title IX. 
8
Yet in many cases, damages are the only remedy 
9
that would effectively rectify past harassment. 
10
(14) These limitations on effective relief thwart 
11
Congress’ underlying purpose to protect students 
12
from harassment, and they create prohibitively high 
13
standards for title IX sexual harassment lawsuits 
14
that are more onerous than those applicable to work-
15
place sexual harassment lawsuits under title VII of 
16
the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e et 
17
seq.). As a result, schools are required to do less to 
18
address harassment against their students than to 
19
address the same harassment of their employees, 
20
meaning that students, who are children and young 
21
adults, must suffer worse harassment than adult em-
22
ployees before they are entitled to a remedy in court. 
23
(15) Some lower courts have added additional

onerous barriers under which a school is only liable

if the victim later experiences further actionable sex-
2

(16) A Federal court of appeals opinion in 
4
Kollaritsch v. Michigan State University Board of 
5
Trustees, 944 F.3d 613, 621–24 (6th Cir. 2019), 
6
went so far as to foreclose money damages if a vic-
7
tim of sexual harassment does not experience further 
8
actionable harassment as a result of the recipient’s 
9
deficient response to a complaint, even if the recipi-
10
ent’s conduct causes educational injuries under title 
11
IX. 
12
(17) Gebser and subsequent opinions create an 
13
incentive for covered entities to insulate themselves 
14
from knowledge of harassment on the basis of sex 
15
rather than adopting and enforcing practices that 
16
will minimize the danger of such harassment. The 
17
opinions thus undermine the purpose of prohibitions 
18
on discrimination in the civil rights laws to induce 
19
covered programs or activities to adopt and enforce 
20
practices that will minimize the danger that vulner-
21
able students or other persons will be exposed to 
22
such odious behavior.

(A) ensure that students and other persons
