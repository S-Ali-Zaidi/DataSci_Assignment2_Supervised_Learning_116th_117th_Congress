RESOLUTION 
Supporting the goals to protect United States military 
personnel from malaria. 
Whereas fighting malaria is in the national interest of the 
United States; 
Whereas reducing the incidence of malaria protects members 
of the Armed Forces deployed to malaria-endemic re-
gions; 
Whereas the ‘‘World malaria report 2020’’ by the World 
Health Organization states that, in 2019, approximately 
409,000 people died of malaria;

Whereas, in 2019, 87 countries and areas had ongoing ma-
laria transmissions, including areas of Africa, the Middle 
East, Southeast Asia, and South America; 
Whereas the Department of Defense reports that a total of 
58 members of the Armed Forces were diagnosed with 
malaria in 2018, a 35-percent increase from 2017; 
Whereas, in 2017, incidents of malaria were diagnosed at or 
reported from 19 different medical facilities in the United 
States, Afghanistan, Qatar, Germany, Djibouti, Japan, 
and the Republic of Korea; 
Whereas the Department of Defense recognizes malaria as 
the leading infectious disease threat to United States 
Armed Forces deployed to the United States Africa Com-
mand area of responsibility and the United States Indo- 
Pacific Command area of responsibility; 
Whereas U.S. support for efforts to fight malaria is in the 
foreign policy and humanitarian interests of the United 
States and highlights the values of the people of the 
United States through the work of governmental, non-
governmental, and faith-based organizations of the 
United States that are on the frontlines of the malaria 
battle globally; 
Whereas U.S. support for efforts to fight malaria and other 
infectious diseases advance the national security strategy 
of the United States, and is a key tool to enhance oper-
ational readiness, interoperability, and security coopera-
tion, protecting Americans at home and abroad; 
Whereas the U.S. Government has played a leading role in 
the recent progress made toward reducing the global bur-
den of malaria and other infectious diseases, particularly

through bilateral, multilateral, international, and civil so-
ciety partners; 
Whereas, since 1893, the Walter Reed Army Institute of Re-
search (WRAIR) has played a leadership role protecting 
United States servicemembers from the world’s most per-
vasive infectious diseases, including malaria, HIV/AIDS, 
Ebola, dengue, and, most recently, COVID–19; 
Whereas the WRAIR Center for Infectious Disease Research 
has been responsible for developing critical Food and 
Drug 
Administration-approved 
medicines, 
vaccines, 
drugs, and other interventions used to prevent malaria, 
Japanese encephalitis, hepatitis A, adenovirus, and other 
infectious diseases in deployed members of the Armed 
Forces; 
Whereas the WRAIR Malaria Vaccine and Experimental 
Therapeutics Branches have emerged as the premier ef-
fort of the Department of Defense to develop vaccines 
and drugs to protect such deployed members from ma-
laria and other infectious diseases and military health 
threats; 
Whereas WRAIR continues to play a leadership role in the 
research and development of lifesaving medicines, includ-
ing the recently approved tafenoquine (a radical cure and 
prophylaxis that protects the warfighter from P vivax re-
lapse, which is a condition that causes approximately 8.5 
million clinical infections per year worldwide); 
Whereas WRAIR leads the fight against drug-resistant 
strains of malaria, developing new treatments that have 
revolutionized malaria prevention efforts; 
Whereas WRAIR’s international network of laboratories sup-
ports medical diplomacy and fosters collaborations be-

tween the United States and host nations in biomedical 
research; and 
Whereas WRAIR’s unique expertise, capabilities, and re-
sources have led to historic clinical trials, testing vaccines 
to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS, Zika, and malaria: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the goals of researching new inter-
2
ventions to prevent and treat malaria, as it is in the 
3
national security, foreign affairs, political, and hu-
4
manitarian interest of the United States; 
5
(2) encourages continued leadership by the 
6
United States through programs such as the Walter 
7
Reed Army Institute of Research to ensure that 
8
force health is not jeopardized by vector-borne dis-
9
eases; and 
10
(3) supports sustained or enhanced efforts to 
11
ensure that once malaria is eliminated in a country, 
12
malaria does not return to the country.
