SEC. 9. RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS. 
3
(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 2 years after the 
4
date of the enactment of this Act, the Commission shall 
5
issue regulations under section 553 of title 5, United 
6
States Code, that require a provider of a large covered 
7
platform that uses a recommender system to do the fol-
8
lowing: 
9
(1) To specify in the terms and conditions of 
10
the provider, in a clear, accessible, and easily com-
11
prehensible manner— 
12
(A) the most salient features, inputs, or 
13
parameters used by the recommender system; 
14
(B) how any personal information used by 
15
the recommender system is collected or inferred 
16
about a user of the platform, and the categories 
17
of such information (including demographic, be-
18
havioral, and any other categories defined by 
19
the Commission); and 
20
(C) any options that the provider makes 
21
available for a user of the platform to modify 
22
the profile of the user or to influence the fea-
23
tures, inputs, or parameters used by the rec-
24
ommender system. 
25

H6796
50 
•HR 6796 IH
(2) To provide an option that does not rely on 
1
any of the user’s personal information (either col-
2
lected or inferred) to determine the order of infor-
3
mation presented to the user. The Commission may 
4
determine reasonable exceptions to ensure product 
5
functionality, such as the user’s language preference 
6
or recognized place. Such option shall be set as a de-
7
fault or presented prominently within the main 
8
interface containing the results of the recommender 
9
system. The provider shall present the options in 
10
good faith, and avoid misleading or harassing con-
11
sumers into making different choices, failing to 
12
maintain parity of unrelated features, or other meas-
13
ures as determined by the Commission. 
14
(b) OPT-IN
FOR CERTAIN PERSONAL INFORMA-
15
TION.—In issuing regulations under subsection (a), the 
16
Commission may determine that certain personal informa-
17
tion may not be used to customize a recommender system 
18
without specific opt-in consent from users. In the case of 
19
such a determination, a provider of a large covered plat-
20
form shall independently obtain opt-in consent for sepa-
21
rate categories of personal information (as categorized and 
22
according to standards set by the Commission) rather 
23
than obtaining a global opt-in consent for all personal in-

formation or multiple categories of personal information

simultaneously.

(c) CONSIDERATIONS FOR RULEMAKING.—In issuing 
3
regulations under subsection (a), the Commission shall 
4
consider— 
5
(1) the ways recommender systems may be used 
6
to help providers of large covered platforms mitigate 
7
systemic risks described in section 4(a)(3); 
8
(2) the frequency with which recommendation 
9
algorithms are trained; and 
10
(3) the technical feasibility of disabling or modi-
11
fying use of features, inputs, or parameters for each 
12
user. 
13
(d) VARIATION BASED ON SIZE AND SCOPE OF PLAT-
14
FORM AND TYPE OF RECOMMENDER SYSTEM.—In issuing 
15
regulations under subsection (a), the Commission shall 
16

17
large covered platform, including by having different re-
18
quirements and for different types of recommender sys-
