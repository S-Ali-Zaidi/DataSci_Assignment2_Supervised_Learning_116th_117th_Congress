SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE. 
6
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Of the 9 million jobs expected to be added 
8
by 2030, more than half, 4.7 million, will be filled

by workers over 55, according to the U.S. Bureau of 
1
Labor Statistics. 
2
(2) From 1995 to 2020, the share of older 
3
workers more than doubled, to nearly 25 percent 
4
from 12 percent. 
5
(3) About 40 percent of middle-class older 
6
workers will be downwardly mobile into poverty or 
7
near poverty in the next ten years when they reach 
8
their sixties in part because of lack of employment 
9
or low wages. 
10
(4) The labor market experience of older work-
11
ers is shaped by structural ageism, which carries 
12
unproven beliefs that older workers are not 
13
trainable, move slow, are expensive, and get sick too 
14
often. 
15
(5) Older workers who have less formal edu-
16
cation, earn lower wages, or who are Black or His-
17
panic tend to experience much worse health than 
18
those who are more advantaged and need more ac-
19
commodation at work and safer working conditions. 
20
(6) Physically and psychologically difficult 
21
working conditions are widespread and damaging for 
22
older workers.

(7) Older workers are more likely to be involun-
1
tary part time, gig, or temporary workers than for 
2
prime age workers. 
3
(8) Nearly 30 percent of older women work in 
4
low wage jobs and most are considered working 
5
poor. 
6
(9) Concern about age discrimination amongst 
7
older workers has reached its highest level in nearly 
8
decades. 
9
(10) More than 1,000,000 older workers were 
10
pushed out or voluntarily left the labor force during 
11
the COVID–19 pandemic. 
12
(11) While some older workers have returned to 
13
the labor force since the beginning of the COVID– 
14
19 pandemic, many have struggled to obtain work 
15
and others fear returning to unsafe working condi-
16
tions. 
17
(12) The labor force participation rate and em-
18
ployment population ratio of older workers both de-
19
clined due to the COVID–19 pandemic and neither 
20
have fully recovered. 
21
(13) Older workers need specific policy consid-
22
eration and assistance that could be met by estab-
23
lishing an Older Workers’ Bureau within the De-
24
partment of Labor.
