A BILL 
To require the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development 
to establish an excess urban heat mitigation grant pro-
gram, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Excess Urban Heat 
4
Mitigation Act of 2022’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Heat stress is a leading weather-related 
8
cause of death in the United States, with over 600 
9
people killed in the United States by extreme heat

every year, and many more experiencing respiratory 
1
problems and heat-related illness. 
2
(2) Urban areas are likely to experience higher 
3
temperatures than surrounding areas due to man-
4
made factors such as low solar reflectance, low tree 
5
cover, high building density, high impervious surface 
6
cover, and waste heat emissions. 
7
(3) Underserved communities are disproportion-
8
ately impacted by extreme heat. In the United 
9
States, low-income census blocks have 15.2 percent 
10
less tree cover and an average land surface tempera-
11
ture that is 1.5 degrees Celsius hotter than high-in-
12
come blocks. 
13
(4) Studies show that in 97 percent of the larg-
14
est urbanized areas in the United States, people of 
15
color live in census tracts with higher surface urban 
16
heat island intensity than non-Hispanic Whites, indi-
17
cating that heat exposure is unequally distributed by 
18
race. 
19
(5) Urban heat is not only a public health 
20
threat but an economic one, as rising heat leads to 
21
increased roadway maintenance costs, higher resi-
22
dential and commercial summer energy costs, and 
23
lost labor productivity, as well as the cost to patients

and health care infrastructure for heat-related hos-
1
pitalizations and emergency department visits. 
2
(6) Excess urban heat causes increased energy 
3
consumption, elevated emission of air pollutants and 
4
greenhouse gasses, and impaired water quality. 
5
(7) Heat waves are expected not only to occur 
6
more frequently in the United States but will also be 
7
of longer duration, lasting 10 to 20 days longer by 
8
the end of the century. 
9
(8) Solutions exist that communities can imple-
10
ment now to mitigate the challenge of urban heat. 
11
One example is the planting of urban trees to offset 
12
or reverse the urban heat island effect. Studies in 
13
multiple United States cities have shown that urban 
14
trees can offset projected increases in heat-related 
15
mortality in 2050 by 40 to 99 percent.
