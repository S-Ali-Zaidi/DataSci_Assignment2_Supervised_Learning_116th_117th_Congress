A BILL 
To defer removal of certain nationals of Iraq for a 24- 
month period, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Deferred Removal for 
4
Iraqi Nationals Including Minorities Act of 2021’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) There are over 1,000 Iraqi nationals living 
8
in the United States who have been ordered re-

moved. In recent times, Iraq has generally declined 
1
permission for repatriation of its nationals, so that 
2
many Iraqis who were ordered removed could not be 
3
repatriated. As a result, the removal orders for 
4
many Iraqis are years or decades old, and are not 
5
based on current country conditions. 
6
(2) Conditions in Iraq have worsened dramati-
7
cally since these removal orders were entered. Re-
8
moval orders entered years or decades ago do not re-
9
liably indicate whether an Iraqi is currently remov-
10
able based on current country conditions and cur-
11
rent law. Iraq’s humanitarian, security, and refugee 
12
crisis has resulted in extraordinary conditions that 
13
today prevent many Iraqi nationals from safely re-
14
turning to Iraq. Many Iraqis with removal orders 
15
will face persecution, torture, or death if removed. 
16
They are therefore now eligible for immigration re-
17
lief that was unavailable when they were originally 
18
ordered removed. 
19
(3) The U.S. State Department currently warns 
20
against any travel to Iraq due to ‘‘terrorism, kidnap-
21
ping, and armed conflict’’. 
22
(4) The most recent State Department report 
23
on human rights practices in Iraq warns of ‘‘unlaw-
24
ful or arbitrary killings by some members of the

Iraq Security Forces (in this Act referred to as 
1
‘ISF’), particularly Iran-aligned elements of the 
2
Popular Mobilization Forces (in this Act referred to 
3
as ‘PMF’); forced disappearances; torture; arbitrary 
4
detention; harsh and life-threatening prison and de-
5
tention center conditions; arbitrary or unlawful in-
6
terference with privacy; restrictions on free expres-
7
sion, the press, and the internet, including censor-
8
ship, site blocking, and criminal libel; legal restric-
9
tions on freedom of movement of women; widespread 
10
official corruption; unlawful recruitment or use of 
11
child soldiers by Iran-aligned elements of the PMF 
12
that operate outside government control; trafficking 
13
in persons; criminalization of lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
14
transgender, and intersex (in this Act referred to as 
15
‘LGBTI’) status or conduct; violence targeting 
16
LGBTI persons; threats of violence against inter-
17
nally displaced persons (in this Act referred to as 
18
‘IDPs’) and returnee populations perceived to have 
19
been affiliated with ISIS; and restrictions on worker 
20
rights, including restrictions on formation of inde-
21
pendent unions and reports of child labor’’. 
22
(5) Iraqis who are removed to Iraq are also at 
23
particular risk if they are perceived as American or 
24
affiliated with the United States, which is the case 
25
01:22 Jul 15, 2021
H4273

•HR 4273 IH
for the vast majority of Iraqis facing removal, since 
1
most have lived in the United States for many years. 
2
Iraqis who have family or employment ties in the 
3
United States face heightened risks within Iraq on 
4
the basis of their perceived loyalty to the United 
5
States. For more than a decade, groups hostile to 
6
the United States have persecuted and tortured ex-
7
tended family on account of a single family mem-
8
ber’s affiliation with the United States through em-
9
ployment or family ties. In 2007, Congress specifi-
10
cally created a refugee program for Iraqis affiliated 
11
with the United States because of the dangers facing 
12
Iraqis who have allied themselves with the United 
13
States. 
14
(6) Noncitizens previously ordered removed 
15
have a right to seek immigration protection or relief 
16
based on current country conditions. 
17
(7) In the summer of 2017, U.S. Immigration 
18
and Customs Enforcement sought to remove many 
19
Iraqi nationals, eventually detaining over 300. As a 
20
result of litigation, most of those detained Iraqis 
21
were able to seek immigration relief based on cur-
22
rent country conditions. Once they were able to ac-
23
cess the immigration court system, a large majority 
24
won motions to reopen their cases so that their eligi-
25

•HR 4273 IH
bility for relief can be determined based on current 
1
country conditions. While many of the cases remain 
2
in process, many of these Iraqis have won merits re-
3
lief, including withholding or deferral of removal 
4
under the Immigration and Nationality Act or Con-
5
vention Against Torture, asylum, reinstatement of 
6
their status as lawful permanent residents, and nat-
7
uralization. 
8
(8) There are an estimated 1,000 Iraqis who 
9
have not yet been able to seek immigration relief 
10
based on current country conditions. Due to the 
11
complexity of the required legal filings and the back-
12
logs in the immigration courts it can take several 
13
years for an individual to seek to reopen their immi-
14
gration case and have their eligibility for immigra-
15
tion relief decided on the merits. 
16
(9) Without sufficient time to seek immigration 
17
relief based on current country conditions, Iraqis 
18
could be removed to persecution, torture, or death 
19
before they receive an individualized adjudication of 
20
their eligibility for relief in light of current law and 
21
current facts. 
22
(10) Deferring removals 24 months would allow 
23
Iraqis who have not yet done so time to seek immi-
24
gration relief based on changed country conditions.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
1
It is the sense of the Congress that— 
2
(1) Iraqis should not be deported if they face 
3
likely persecution, torture, or death; 
4
(2) because of changing country conditions in 
5
Iraq and the age of the Iraqis’ removal orders, it 
6
would be both unfair and dangerous to deport Iraqis 
7
without ensuring that their cases will be individually 
8
considered based on current country conditions; and 
9
(3) the removal of Iraq nationals described in 
10
section 4 should be deferred for a period of 24 
11
months, at the end of which Congress should have 
12
the opportunity to reevaluate country conditions in 
13
Iraq.
