Whereas the President, pursuant to the provisions of section 
10 of the Railway Labor Act (45 U.S.C. 160), by Execu-
tive Order No. 14077 of July 15, 2022, created Presi-
dential Emergency Board No. 250 to investigate the dis-
putes and report findings; 
Whereas the recommendations of Presidential Emergency 
Board No. 250 issued on August 16, 2022, formed the 
basis for tentative agreements between all of the parties 
to the disputes; 
Whereas some, but not all, of the tentative agreements have 
been ratified by the union memberships in final resolu-
tion of certain of the disputes between the parties; 
Whereas unresolved disputes remain between the parties 
whose tentative agreements were not ratified by the 
union memberships; 
Whereas the recommendations of Presidential Emergency 
Board No. 250 issued on August 16, 2022, have not re-
sulted in a final resolution of all the disputes; 
Whereas all the procedures provided under the Railway Labor 
Act (45 U.S.C. 151 et seq.), and further procedures 
agreed to by the parties, have been exhausted and have 
not resulted in a final resolution of all the disputes; 
Whereas it is desirable that all such disputes be resolved in 
a manner which encourages solutions reached through 
collective bargaining; 
Whereas Congress, under the Commerce Clause of the Con-
stitution, has the authority and responsibility to ensure 
the uninterrupted operation of essential transportation 
services;
