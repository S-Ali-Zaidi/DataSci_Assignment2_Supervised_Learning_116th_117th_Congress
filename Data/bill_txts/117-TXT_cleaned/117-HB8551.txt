Congress finds that— 
7
(1) the Environmental Protection Agency can 
8

ment by consistently gathering information on local 
1
air quality monitoring systems across the United 
2
States; 
3
(2) newer air sensor technologies create the 
4
possibility for enhanced, community-scale air pollu-
5
tion data; 
6
(3) despite national progress in reducing air 
7
pollution, more than 40 percent of people in the 
8
United States live in places with unhealthy levels of 
9
ozone or particle pollution; 
10
(4) people of color, Indigenous people, and low- 
11
income communities bear disproportionately higher 
12
exposures and health burdens due to air pollution; 
13
(5) air quality can vary up to 800 percent from 
14
block to block within a single neighborhood; and 
15
(6) existing methods that are prescribed for 
16
basin-wide air quality monitoring are cost-prohibitive 
17
for monitoring community-scale air quality.
