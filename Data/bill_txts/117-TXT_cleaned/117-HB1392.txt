SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Jamal Khashoggi, a United States resident, 
8
Saudi journalist, and Washington Post columnist,

was killed and dismembered in the Saudi consulate 
1
in Istanbul, Turkey on October 2, 2018, by at least 
2
14 intelligence officers of the Government of Saudi 
3
Arabia. Khashoggi was lured to the consulate under 
4
the false cover of needing to address a consular mat-
5
ter. Following the killing, 17 officers from the Saudi 
6
intelligence service, or Mabahith, reportedly visited 
7
Istanbul and cleansed the crime scene. 
8
(2) At the time of his murder, Khashoggi was 
9
living in Virginia under an ‘‘O’’ visa and was in the 
10
process of applying for a permanent residency. 
11
(3) A subsequent, highly-credible investigation 
12
by the United Nations concluded that Khashoggi’s 
13
killing was premeditated and that the mission was 
14
endorsed, planned, and overseen by senior Saudi of-
15
ficials.
