A BILL 
To address the needs of workers in industries likely to be 
impacted by rapidly evolving technologies. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Investing in Tomor-

row’s Workforce Act of 2021’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress makes the following findings: 
7
(1) In 2014, the United States spent just 0.1 
8
percent of the Nation’s Gross Domestic Product on 
9
labor market policies, less than half of what the 
10

H2645
2 
•HR 2645 IH
United States spent on labor market policies 30 
1
years ago. 
2
(2) The number of workers receiving federally 
3
supported training has declined in the past 3 dec-
4
ades as advances in technology have simultaneously 
5
shifted labor market demand over time. 
6
(3) Job losses from automation are more likely 
7
to impact women, people of color, and workers mak-
8
ing less than $40,000 annually. 
9
(4) The COVID–19 pandemic has accelerated 
10
trends in automation, with 43 percent of businesses 
11
in the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs sur-
12
vey indicating they plan to reduce their workforce as 
13
a result of technology integration. 
14
(5) Strong Federal investment in expanding 
15
training services for workers whose jobs may be lost 
16
due to automation could prepare the United States 
17
workforce to better adapt to changes in the labor 
18
market and enter into skilled positions in techno-
19
logically oriented occupations and industries. 
20
(6) A focus on preparing the workforce of the 
21
United States for jobs that utilize advanced tech-
22
nologies could grow wages, increase economic pro-
23
ductivity, and boost the competitiveness of the 
24
United States.
