RESOLUTION 
Supporting a diplomatic boycott of the XXIV Olympic Winter 
Games and XIII Paralympic Winter Games in Beijing, 
and encouraging the International Olympic Committee 
to develop a framework for reprimanding or disqualifying 
host countries that are committing mass atrocities. 
Whereas for 125 years, the Olympic Movement has worked 
to build a better and more peaceful world by supporting 
young people through amateur athletics, bringing to-
gether athletes from many countries in friendly competi-
tion, and forging new relationships bound by friendship, 
solidarity, and fair play;

Whereas the International Olympic Committee announced in 
July 2015 that Beijing would be the host city of the 
2022 Olympic Winter Games; 
Whereas, in 2001, the International Olympic Committee and 
International Paralympic Committee signed the ‘‘One 
Bid, One City’’ agreement, which recognizes that every 
Olympic host city also has an obligation to host the 
Paralympic Games using the same venues, facilities, and 
infrastructure; 
Whereas the terms of the ‘‘One Bid, One City’’ agreement 
also designate Beijing as the host city of the XIII 
Paralympic Winter Games; 
Whereas Article 2 of the 1948 United Nations Convention on 
the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide 
defines genocide as ‘‘any of the following acts committed 
with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, 
ethnical, racial or religious group, as such: (a) killing 
members of the group; (b) causing serious bodily or men-
tal harm to members of the group; (c) deliberately inflict-
ing on the group conditions of life calculated to bring 
about its physical destruction in whole or in part; (d) im-
posing measures intended to prevent births within the 
group; [or] (e) forcibly transferring children of the group 
to another group.’’; 
Whereas, in January 2021, the Department of State deter-
mined that the Chinese Government ‘‘has committed 
genocide against the predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and 
other ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang’’, 
and Secretary of State Antony Blinken agreed, stating, 
‘‘[F]orcing men, women and children into concentration 
camps, trying to in effect re-educate them to be adher-

ents to the Chinese Communist Party—all of that speaks 
to an effort to commit genocide.’’; 
Whereas the Chinese Communist Party has a history of re-
pressing the people and Government of Tibet and in 
2019 initiated policies of militarized labor training and 
forced transfer of Tibetan farmers to work camps, echo-
ing policies underway in Xinjiang; 
Whereas there are alarming reports of the Chinese Com-
munist Party suppressing education in minority lan-
guages, such as Tibetan and Mongolian, in a state-spon-
sored effort for cultural homogenization; 
Whereas, in June 2020, the Chinese Communist Party en-
acted the Law of the People’s Republic of China on Safe-
guarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region, which has curtailed Hong Kong’s 
judicial autonomy and led to mass arrests and severe 
punishments on prodemocracy activists and demonstra-
tors; 
Whereas, on October 4, 2021, the People’s Liberation Army 
mounted the largest-ever incursion into Taiwan’s Air De-
fense Identification Zone; 
Whereas a ‘‘diplomatic boycott’’ of an international event in-
volves a government declining to send a diplomatic dele-
gation to represent the government in an official capac-
ity; 
Whereas a diplomatic boycott of the XXIV Olympic Winter 
Games and XIII Paralympic Winter Games would not 
prohibit or discourage Team USA athletes and support 
staff from attending or participating; 
Whereas, on July 8, 2021, the European Parliament passed 
a nonbinding resolution calling on the European ‘‘Com-

mission, the Council, and the Member States to decline 
invitations for government representatives and diplomats 
to attend the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics unless the 
Chinese Government demonstrates a verifiable improve-
ment in the human rights situation in Hong Kong, the 
Xinjiang Uyghur Region, Tibet, Inner Mongolia and else-
where in China’’; 
Whereas international law often identifies genocide, crimes 
against humanity, war crimes, and ethnic cleansing as in-
stances of mass atrocities; 
Whereas people in the United States and Europe called for 
a boycott of the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, Ger-
many, out of concern for human rights abuses; 
Whereas people in the United States and Europe called for 
a boycott of the 2008 Summer Olympics and Paralympics 
in Beijing out of concern for human rights abuses com-
mitted by the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese 
Communist Party’s refusal to condemn the Sudanese 
Government’s genocide in Darfur; 
Whereas then-President George W. Bush attended the open-
ing ceremony of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, 
and the United States did not subsequently engage in 
any form of boycott; 
Whereas human rights abuses committed by the Chinese 
Communist Party have worsened since 2008; and 
Whereas a government that is hosting the Olympics and 
Paralympics yet also committing mass atrocities is tar-
nishing the spirit of the Olympics and Paralympics and 
is exploiting the Games to advance a false narrative of 
peace and unity: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
