religious group, including attacks on houses of wor-
1
ship and Jewish community centers. 
2
(2) Amid ongoing conflict in May 2021 between 
3
Israel, which is one of the closest allies of the United 
4
States, and Hamas, which is a terrorist organization 
5
and has been designated by the United States as 
6
such since 1997, media reports indicate that there 
7
has been a dramatic increase in hate crimes and vio-
8
lence against Jews in the United States. 
9
(3) Media reports indicate that activists and 
10
mobs acting in support of the terrorist group, 
11
Hamas, and its sympathizers have incited and per-
12
petrated hate crimes and violence against Jews in 
13
the United States in 2021. 
14
(4) A recent survey conducted by the Anti-Def-
15
amation League indicates that 63 percent of Amer-
16
ican Jews have directly experienced or witnessed 
17
anti-Semitic hate incidents within the past five 
18
years. 
19
(5) Anti-Semitism has long perpetrated myths 
20
about Jews, including the Russian fabrication of the 
21
Protocols of the Elders of Zion and the wide circula-
22
tion of libelous falsehoods about the Jewish murder 
23
of infants.

(6) In its most extreme form, anti-Semitism 
1
aims at the physical destruction of the Jewish peo-
2
ple, as seen in pogroms, forced conversions and Nazi 
3
Germany’s murder of over six million Jews. 
4
(7) Anti-Semitism has included attacks on the 
5
livelihood of Jews including prohibitions on land 
6
ownership, campaigns to boycott, confiscate or de-
7
stroy Jewish businesses, and denial of the ability of 
8
Jews to practice certain professions. 
9
(8) In the United States, Jews have suffered 
10
from systematic discrimination in the form of exclu-
11
sion from home ownership in certain neighborhoods, 
12
prohibition from staying in certain hotels, restric-
13
tions upon membership in private clubs and other 
14
associations, limitations upon admission to certain 
15
educational institutions and other barriers to equal 
16
justice under the law. 
17
(9) In the United States, Jews have faced, and 
18
continue to face, false accusations of divided loyalty 
19
between the United States and Israel, false claims 
20
that they purchase political power with money, and 
21
false accusations about control of the financial sys-
22
tem, along with other negative stereotypes.
