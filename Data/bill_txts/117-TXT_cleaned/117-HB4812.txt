SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Border Health Secu-
2
rity Act of 2021’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress makes the following findings: 
5
(1) The United States-Mexico border is an 
6
interdependent and dynamic region of approximately 
7
15,000,000 residents and millions of border cross-
8
ings each year, with significant and unique public 
9
health challenges. 
10
(2) These challenges include low rates of health 
11
insurance coverage, poor access to health care serv-
12
ices, lack of education or access to information, pov-
13
erty-related illness, including undernutrition, and 
14
high rates of infectious diseases, such as tuber-
15
culosis, West Nile virus, and Zika virus, as well as 
16
other noncommunicable diseases such as cardio-
17
vascular disease, asthma, diabetes, and obesity. 
18
(3) As the COVID–19 pandemic has illustrated, 
19
diseases do not respect international boundaries, and 
20
a strong public health effort at and along the United 
21
States, Mexico, and Canada borders is crucial to not 
22
only protect and improve the health of Americans 
23
but also to help secure the country against biosecu-
24
rity and other emerging threats.

(4) For over 20 years, the United States-Mex-
1
ico Border Health Commission has served as a cru-
2
cial binational institution to address these unique 
3
and truly cross-border health issues. 
4
(5) The COVID–19 pandemic has also high-
5
lighted the need for continued coordination of re-
6
sources, effective communication, and information 
7
sharing between countries to address emerging pub-
8
lic health crises.
