(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:

H9211
2 
•HR 9211 IH
(1) Energy independence and security are crit-
1
ical for a country to maintain its sovereignty and 
2
independence. 
3
(2) The International Energy Agency (‘‘IEA’’) 
4
defines energy security as the uninterrupted avail-
5
ability of energy sources at an affordable price. 
6
(3) The IEA defines long-term energy security 
7
as primarily dealing with timely investments to sup-
8
ply energy in line with economic developments and 
9
environmental needs. 
10
(4) The IEA defines short-term energy security 
11
as focusing on the ability of a country’s energy sys-
12
tem to react promptly to sudden changes in the sup-
13
ply-demand balance. 
14
(5) The IEA found in February 2022 that Rus-
15
sia’s unlawful invasion of Ukraine poses serious im-
16
plications for international energy security. 
17
(6) The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
18
Change (IPCC), a United Nations body that pro-
19
vides regular assessments on climate change, issued 
20
its sixth report in February 2022, and found that 
21
‘‘human-induced climate change, including more fre-
22
quent and intense extreme events, has caused wide-
23
spread adverse impacts and related losses and dam-

ages to nature and people, beyond natural climate 
1
variability’’. 
2
(7) The IPCC notes that to avoid mounting loss 
3
of life, biodiversity, and infrastructure, we must have 
4
ambitious, accelerated action to adapt to climate 
5
change, while also making rapid, deep cuts in green-
6
house gas emissions. 
7
(8) The World Meteorological Organization’s 
8
State of the Climate in Latin America and the Car-
9
ibbean 2020 report found that— 
10
(A) widespread drought across Latin 
11
America and the Caribbean has had significant 
12
impact on inland shipping routes, crop yields, 
13
and food production, and consequently led to 
14
worsening food insecurity; 
15
(B) extreme weather events affected more 
16
than 8 million people across Central America, 
17
exacerbating food insecurity in countries al-
18
ready crippled by economic shocks, COVID-19 
19
impacts, and conflict; and 
20
(C) sea-level rise poses a major risk to low- 
21
lying coastal zones in the Latin America and 
22
the Caribbean. 
23
(9) Climate change is projected to increase the 
24
displacement of people and the United Nations High

Commissioner for Refugees estimates that an aver-
1
age of 21.5 million people have been forcibly dis-
2
placed by weather-related sudden onset hazards 
3
every year since 2008. 
4
(10) Rising commodity and energy prices, as 
5
well as other global economic shocks such as those 
6
caused by natural disasters, pandemics, and conflict 
7
pose a serious security risk that may lead to social 
8
unrest and instability in Latin America and the Car-
9
ibbean. 
10
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
11
gress that the United States has economic and national 
12
security interests in assisting Latin America and the Car-
13
ibbean to achieve sustainable energy security. 
14
(c) STATEMENT OF POLICY.—It is the policy of the 
15
United States— 
16
(1) to advance United States foreign policy and 
17
development goals by helping Latin America and the 
18
Caribbean meet its short-term energy needs; 
19
(2) to promote the energy security of Latin 
20
America and the Caribbean by encouraging the de-
21
velopment of accessible, transparent, competitive, 
22
and solvent energy markets that provide diversified 
23
sources, types, and routes of energy, prioritizing

clean energy sources that reduce carbon emissions 
1
and address climate change; 
2
(3) to encourage United States public and pri-
3
vate sector investment in Latin American and Carib-
4
bean energy infrastructure projects to bridge the gap 
5
between energy security and commercial demand in 
6
a way that is consistent with the region’s current ab-
7
sorptive capacity, and that recognizes the impor-
8
tance of building and widening the absorptive capac-
9
ity of the region; 
10
(4) to help facilitate the export of United States 
11
energy resources, technology, and expertise to global 
12
markets in a way that benefits the comprehensive 
13
energy security of Latin America and the Caribbean; 
14
and
