Congress finds the following:

•HR 7501 IH
(1) Interstate Route 70 is the gateway to the 
1
Rocky Mountains and a major east-west interstate 
2
highway that runs through and connects 10 different 
3
states from Baltimore, Maryland, to Cove Fort, 
4
Utah. 
5
(2) Because of natural hazards, Interstate 
6
Route 70 through Glenwood experiences significant 
7
closures that last greater than 1 week, three or four 
8
times a decade. 
9
(3) Substantial improvements to existing roads 
10
and possible alternative routes should be studied and 
11
then funded in a timely manner to ensure the con-
12
tinuation of commerce as well as the safe movement 
13
of goods and people in the event that Interstate 
14
Route 70 is shut down again in the future. 
15
(4) Closures of Interstate Route 70 are ex-
16
tremely costly, with an economic impact estimated at 
17
$1 million per hour. 
18
(5) At this time, the local counties directly im-
19
pacted by these closures and some of the alternatives 
20
proposed in this bill prefer for any county route or 
21
county road impacted by this bill to remain under 
22
county control and not become a state highway.
