RESOLUTION 
Recognizing people of African descent and Black Europeans. 
Whereas the 109th Congress passed H. Con. Res. 60 and S. 
Con. Res. 90, recognizing African descendants in Latin 
America and the Caribbean, raising awareness of the rac-
ism and discrimination faced by those communities, and 
leading to numerous public and private sector initiatives 
between the United States and Latin American and Car-
ibbean countries to improve the situation of African de-
scendants; 
Whereas the persistence of racism and discrimination in Eu-
rope similarly necessitates congressional action to raise 
awareness and promote public and private sector initia-
tives to stem this trend;

Whereas the terms ‘‘Afro-European’’, ‘‘African European’’, 
or ‘‘Black European’’ refer to people of African ancestry 
or descent born in, citizens of, or residing in Europe; 
Whereas an estimated 15,000,000 to 20,000,000 Black Euro-
peans live in and have long had a presence in Europe, 
forming an influential part of the African diaspora; 
Whereas the story of Black Europeans remains widely untold, 
rendering many of their past and present contributions to 
the political and social life of Europe invisible or forgot-
ten; 
Whereas unlike more contemporary figures, largely unknown 
Black Europeans have made significant contributions to 
European history and culture, including Spanish poet 
Juan Latino, Italian Duke Alessandro Medici, French 
novelist Alexandre Dumas, German scholar Anthony Wil-
liam Amo, French Composer Le Chevalier de St. George, 
British abolitionist Oladuah Equiano, and Russian Gen-
eral and Governor Abram Hannibal, great-grandfather of 
Russian poet Aleksandr Pushkin; 
Whereas the largest estimated populations of Black Euro-
peans can be found in France (approximately 2,500,000), 
the United Kingdom (approximately 1,500,000), Ger-
many (approximately 1,000,000), and the Netherlands 
(approximately 500,000), in addition to sizeable popu-
lations in Italy, Portugal, Sweden, Norway, Ireland, Rus-
sia, Switzerland, Spain, Belgium, Denmark, and Austria; 
Whereas the presence of Black Europeans can be traced 
throughout ancient history to the present from both vol-
untary and forced migration resulting from the geo-
graphical proximity of Europe to Africa and the Middle 
East, the transatlantic slave trade, the colonization of Af-

rica and the Caribbean, African and African-American 
military deployments, to the movement of refugees and 
asylum seekers, and educational and other professional 
exchanges; 
Whereas although Black Europeans have made significant 
achievements in and contributions to European society, 
large numbers have experienced and continue to be more 
likely than the general population to experience discrimi-
nation and to be underrepresented in leadership roles in 
the public and private sector; 
Whereas racism has long been, and continues to be, a prob-
lem in Europe; 
Whereas, on April 29, 2008, before the Commission on Secu-
rity and Cooperation in Europe, at a hearing entitled 
‘‘The State of (In)visible Black Europe: Race, Rights, 
and Politics’’, Dr. Philomena Essed stated, ‘‘Probably the 
only common European experience among many, if not 
all, Afro-descendants is their exposure to [. . .] racism 
and systemic discrimination, regardless of country, socio- 
economic conditions, gender, age, or level of education’’, 
author Gary Younge stated, ‘‘We are here because you 
were there [. . .]’’, and Swedish Parliamentarian Joe 
Frans called for ‘‘a transatlantic dialogue on the experi-
ences of [people of African descent]’’; 
Whereas, as early as 1997, the European Commission opinion 
poll entitled ‘‘Racism and Xenophobia in Europe’’ re-
ported a ‘‘worrying level of racism and xenophobia in 
[European Union] member states, with nearly 33% of 
those interviewed openly describing themselves as ‘quite 
racist’ or ‘very racist’.’’;

•HRES 132 IH 
Whereas annual reports of the European Union Fundamental 
Rights Agency (FRA) and both the 2009 and 2018 Euro-
pean Union Minorities and Discrimination Survey (EU– 
MIDIS I and II), the first European Union-wide surveys 
of ethnic minority and immigrant groups’ experiences of 
discrimination and victimization in everyday life in the 
then 28 member states of the European Union, found 
that persons of African descent experience high incidents 
of discriminatory treatment, racially motivated crime, and 
victimization, and lacked an awareness of their rights, 
often underreporting cases of hate crimes and other 
forms of discrimination to law enforcement and human 
rights agencies, and that the situation had not drastically 
improved in the years between the two reports; 
Whereas, in November 2018, the FRA launched ‘‘Being 
Black in the EU: Second European Union Minorities and 
Discrimination Survey’’, and called for member states to 
develop specific solutions and guidance to address find-
ings that 30 percent of respondents had been racially 
harassed, 5 percent physically attacked, 25 percent dis-
criminated against at work or when looking for work, up 
to 76 percent faced unemployment in some countries, and 
were experiencing high rates of discrimination in housing 
and in the justice system, including profiling by law en-
forcement; 
Whereas the Organization for Security and Co-operation in 
Europe Office for Democratic Institutions and Human 
Rights’ (OSCE/ODIHR) most recent 2019 hate crimes 
report found more than 3,000 racist and xenophobic inci-
dents, including a number targeting Black Europeans, 
while OSCE reports in previous years found a number of 
deaths and violent assaults against ‘‘people of African or-

igin’’, and that they are often targets of racist and 
antimigrant violence, especially in Eastern Europe, yet in 
many countries hate crimes are underreported and legal 
assistance and financial support for victims while recov-
ering from violent attacks does not exist; 
Whereas prejudice and discrimination toward Black Euro-
peans has also been linked to changes in immigration and 
asylum laws as a result of antiterrorism initiatives and 
the growth and mainstreaming of nationalist and anti-im-
migrant political parties and groups, including White su-
premacists, neo-Nazis, and skinheads; 
Whereas, over a decade ago, numerous civil society reports, 
including the 2009 report entitled, ‘‘Ethnic Profiling in 
the European Union’’, and subsequent reports found that 
police officers in the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Ger-
many, the Netherlands, and Russia routinely use racial 
profiling, including targeting African descendants when 
deciding whom to target for stops, searches, raids, and 
surveillance, leading at that time to some of the largest 
Europeanwide grassroots and legal efforts to end racial 
profiling in France, Germany, and elsewhere in Europe, 
and over a decade of pan-European antiracism and em-
powerment initiatives continuing until this day and re-
cently highlighted by global racial justice movements in 
response to the tragic death of George Floyd in the 
United States; 
Whereas there have been numerous efforts by the public and 
private sector to address racial discrimination and in-
equality in Europe, including the introduction of anti-
discrimination and equality laws that include legal sup-
port for special measures or positive (affirmative) action, 
creation of equality bodies, media campaigns, and efforts

to increase minority political participation, and cam-
paigns to end the use of stereotypes and derogatory 
terms to refer to people of African descent in everyday 
language, the media, and textbooks; 
Whereas these efforts include the United Nations designation 
of 2011 as the International Year for People of African 
Descent and 2015–2024 as the International Decade for 
People of African Descent in an effort to strengthen na-
tional actions to ensure that people of African descent 
enjoy economic, cultural, social, civil, and political rights, 
as well as promote a greater knowledge of and respect for 
their diverse heritage and culture, and the November 12 
and 13, 2009, United Nations (UN) Second Session of 
the Forum on Minority Issues focused on Minorities and 
Effective Political Participation convened by United Na-
tions Independent Expert on Minority Issues, Gay 
McDougall; 
Whereas these efforts also include the OSCE Parliamentary 
Assembly’s (PA) annual reports of the Special Represent-
ative on Anti-Semitism, Racism, and Intolerance, and the 
adoption of Resolutions: ‘‘A Call for OSCE Action to Ad-
dress Violence and Discrimination’’ in 2016, ‘‘Addressing 
Racism and Xenophobia Affecting People of African De-
scent in the OSCE Region’’ in 2012, and ‘‘Strengthening 
Efforts to Combat Racism and Xenophobia and Foster 
Inclusion’’ in 2011 that included recognition of the Inter-
national Year for People of African Descent, and calling 
for the OSCE to implement several strategic initiatives to 
address racial and ethnic discrimination in the OSCE re-
gion;

organized by Racism and Xenophobia Advisor Larry 
Olomoofe, and has since annually hosted antidiscrimina-
tion initiatives that include a focus on people of African 
descent on hate crimes, women, political participation, 
strengthening civil society, and other issues; 
Whereas these efforts also include transatlantic meetings of 
Black European and other diverse legislators held annu-
ally at the European Parliament in Brussels, Belgium, 
and in the United States Congress in Washington, DC, 
including the April 17–19, 2009, ‘‘Black European Sum-
mit: Transatlantic Dialogue on Political Participation’’ 
and adoption of the Brussels Declaration on political par-
ticipation; and subsequent ‘‘Transatlantic Minority Polit-
ical Leadership Conferences’’; 
Whereas, as part of the March 24, 2011, Transatlantic Mi-
nority Political Leadership Conference (TMPLC), legisla-
tors and minority leaders from North America and Eu-
rope held a Parliamentary Forum at the European Par-
liament in Brussels, Belgium, to discuss a ‘‘Joint Action 
Plan on Racial and Ethnic Equality and Inclusion’’ be-
tween the European Union and the United States; 
Whereas, in 2011, Members of the Transatlantic Minority 
Political Leadership Conference worked in partnership 
with the German Marshall Fund, the Department of 
State, and other stakeholders to found the Transatlantic 
Inclusion Leaders Network (TILN) to increase diverse 
representation in policymaking; 
Whereas at the U.S. Helsinki Commission hearing Public Di-

To achieve this, we must bring our leadership opportuni-

make this possible. The future of transatlantic relations 
depends on [the] entrepreneurial approach [of TILN].’’; 
Whereas, in October 2013, European parliamentarians in 
partnership with the European Network Against Racism 
(ENAR) held ‘‘(In)visible Diversity’’ a series of debates 
in the European Parliament, including a debate entitled, 
‘‘People of African Descent and Black Europeans: Reali-
ties of Afrophobia’’ and in 2015 released the first pan- 
European policy guide reviewing the current situation en-

Whereas, in January 2014, the Parliamentary Assembly of 
the Council of Europe (PACE) adopted Resolution 1967 
(2014) on ‘‘A strategy to prevent racism and intolerance 
in Europe’’ and implemented the recommendations; 
Whereas, in January 2015, PACE established the No Hate

peans, including in employment, housing, education, 
health, political participation, criminal justice and other 
sectors’’; 
Whereas, on July 25, 2017, the Council of Europe Commis-

ready established Black communities [. . .] European 
states must first come to terms with their own past [in-
cluding] publicly acknowledge that slavery, the slave

health, education, justice, employment, and other sectors; 
Whereas, in October 2017, the United Kingdom Prime Min-
