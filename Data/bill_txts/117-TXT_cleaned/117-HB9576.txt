A BILL 
To require the Administrator of the Environmental Protec-
tion Agency to develop and carry out a benchmarking 
and transparency initiative for commercial and multi-

Congress finds the following: 
9
(1) The climate crisis is raging and is already 
10
imposing significant costs on the economy of the 
11
United States. 
12
(2) The Biden-Harris Administration has com-
13
mitted to reducing harmful climate pollution by 50 
14
to 52 percent below 2005 levels economy-wide by 
15
2030. 
16
(3) Increasing energy efficiency will improve en-
17
ergy security, save money on energy bills, create 
18
jobs, and reduce harmful climate pollution.

•HR 9576 IH
(4) Building energy benchmarking and disclo-
1
sure helps provide transparency in building energy 
2
efficiency and has provided substantial benefits at 
3
affordable costs to State and local governments who 
4
have adopted benchmarking, including reducing en-
5
ergy use and emissions, helping tenants become in-
6
formed about the utility costs associated with prop-
7
erties, helping tenants experience better health and 
8
comfort in properties, helping building owners expe-
9
rience lower vacancy and turnover rates, and allow-
10
ing policymakers to make more informed decisions 
11
about future energy efficiency policies. 
12
(5) A Federal benchmarking requirement will 
13
reduce harmful climate pollution that crosses State 
14
boundaries, provide information for people relocating 
15
to other States, and harmonize building energy effi-
16
ciency and disclosure requirements in metropolitan 
17
areas that cross State lines.
