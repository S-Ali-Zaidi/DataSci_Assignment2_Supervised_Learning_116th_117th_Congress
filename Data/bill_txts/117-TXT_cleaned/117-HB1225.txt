Congress finds the following:

•HR 1225 IH
(1) The greatest national asset of the United 
1
States in protecting the homeland and advancing the 
2
interests of the United States abroad is the talent 
3
and diversity of the national security workforce. 
4
(2) The United States has made important 
5
progress toward harnessing the extraordinary range 
6
of backgrounds, cultures, perspectives, skills, and ex-
7
periences of the population of the United States to-
8
ward keeping the United States safe and strong. 
9
(3) The 2015 National Security Strategy recog-
10
nized that the diversity of the national security 
11
workforce of the United States is a strategic asset 
12
that enhances the ability of the United States to 
13
lead on the global stage. 
14
(4) In March 2011, the Military Leadership Di-
15
versity Commission demonstrated that minorities 
16
and women are still underrepresented among the top 
17
leadership of the Armed Forces, as compared with 
18
the members they lead. 
19
(5) Although African Americans, Latinos or 
20
Hispanics, Native Americans, and Asians represent 
21
34 percent of the workforce of the United States, in 
22
2016, only 10 and 13 percent, respectively, of the 
23
senior positions in the civil service and the Foreign

Service at the Department of State were occupied by 
1
members of these groups. 
2
(6) As of 2015, African Americans, Latinos or 
3
Hispanics, Native Americans, and Asians rep-
4
resented only 22 percent of the officer corps of the 
5
Armed Forces, far less than the enlisted forces they 
6
lead, 40 percent of the members of which are from 
7
these groups. 
8
(7) In the intelligence community, African 
9
Americans, Latinos or Hispanics, Native Americans, 
10
and Asians represented 24 percent of the employees, 
11
but only 11 percent of the senior positions. 
12
(8) The percentages of Latinos or Hispanics as 
13
part of the overall Federal workforce and in senior 
14
positions in the Federal workforce are even lower, at 
15
8 percent and 4 percent, respectively, as compared 
16
to the general population of the United States, 
17
which is 17 percent Latino or Hispanic. 
18
(9) Latinos or Hispanics represented only a 
19
fraction of the senior positions at the Department of 
20
State, 3 percent and 5 percent, respectively, for posi-
21
tions in the civil service and Foreign Service, only 1 
22
percent for the officer corps of the Armed Forces, 
23
and 3 percent for senior positions in the intelligence 
24
community.

(10) With regard to gender diversity, of the in-
1
dividuals in senior positions in the civil service or the 
2
Foreign Service at the Department of State 39 per-
3
cent and 31 percent are female, respectively. For the 
4
Department of Defense, 24 percent of the individ-
5
uals in senior civilian positions are female, of the 
6
senior grades of the Armed Forces, 8 percent of the 
7
officers are female, and 12 percent of enlisted mem-
8
bers of the Armed Forces are females. Of the indi-
9
viduals in senior positions in the intelligence commu-
10
nity, 29 percent are female, compared to the overall 
11
Federal workforce, which is 33.7 percent female. 
12
(11) In concert with the findings of the Military 
13
Leadership Diversity Commission, the amendments 
14
made by section 519 of the National Defense Au-
15
thorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 (Public Law 
16
112–239; 126 Stat. 1721) mandated that the Armed 
17
Forces develop and implement a plan to accurately 
18
measure the efforts of the Department of Defense 
19
and Coast Guard to ‘‘achieve a dynamic, sustainable 
20
level of members of the armed forces (including re-
21
serve components) that, among both commissioned 
22
officers and senior enlisted personnel of each armed 
23
force, will reflect the diverse population of the 
24
United States eligible to serve in the armed forces,

including gender specific, racial, and ethnic popu-

(12) The amendments made by section 1011 of 
3
the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention 
4
Act of 2004 (Public Law 108–458; 118 Stat. 3643) 
5
called on the intelligence community to prescribe 
6
personnel policies and programs that ensure its per-
7
sonnel ‘‘are sufficiently diverse for purposes of the 
8
collection and analysis of intelligence through the re-
9
cruitment and training of women, minorities, and in-
10
dividuals with diverse ethnic, cultural, and linguistic 
11
backgrounds’’. 
12
(13) The Department of State Authorities Act, 
13
Fiscal Year 2017 (Public Law 114–323), urges the 
14
State Department to promote a diverse representa-
15
tion among mid- and senior-level career professionals 
16
and section 101 of the Foreign Service Act of 1980 
17
(22 U.S.C. 3901) urges the Department of State to 
18
develop policies to encourage the entry into and ad-
19

force of national security agencies contribute to the 
6
vitality and success of their national security mis-
7

8
(3) promoting diversity and inclusion within the 
9
national security workforce must be a joint effort 
10
and requires engagement by senior leadership, man-
11
agers, and the entire workforce, as well as effective 
12
collaboration among those responsible for human re-
13
sources, equal employment opportunity, and diver-
14
sity and inclusion issues; and 
15
(4) as the United States becomes more diverse 
16
and the challenges it faces more complex, the United 
17
States must continue to invest in policies to recruit, 
18
retain, and develop the best and brightest from all
