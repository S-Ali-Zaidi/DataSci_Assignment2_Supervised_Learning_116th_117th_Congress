A BILL 
To create a Carbon Dividend Trust Fund for the American 
people in order to encourage market-driven innovation 
of clean energy technologies and market efficiencies 
which will reduce harmful pollution and leave a healthier, 
more stable, and more prosperous Nation for future gen-
erations.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Energy Innovation and 
4
Carbon Dividend Act of 2021’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
The Congress finds that— 
7
(1) efficient markets strengthen our economy 
8
and benefit our Nation by encouraging competition, 
9
innovation, and technological progress; 
10
(2) efficient markets should reflect all costs of 
11
goods to ensure that they advance America’s pros-
12
perity and national interests; 
13
(3) emissions of carbon pollution and other 
14
harmful pollutants into our Nation’s air impose sub-
15
stantial costs on all Americans and on future gen-
16
erations; and 
17
(4) creation of a Carbon Dividend Trust Fund, 
18
to be distributed to the American people, will make 
19
markets more efficient, create jobs, and stimulate 
20
competition, innovation, and technological progress 
21
that benefit all Americans and future generations.
