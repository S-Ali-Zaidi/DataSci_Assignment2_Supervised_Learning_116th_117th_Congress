RESOLUTION 
Recognizing September 11, 2021, as a ‘‘National Day of 
Service and Remembrance’’. 
Whereas, on September 11, 2001, the United States endured 
a violent terrorist attack leading to the tragic deaths and 
injuries of thousands of innocent United States citizens 
and other citizens from more than 90 different nations 
and territories; 
Whereas in response to the attacks in New York City, Wash-
ington, DC, and Shanksville, Pennsylvania, firefighters, 
uniformed officers, emergency medical technicians, physi-
cians, nurses, military personnel, and other first respond-
ers immediately rose to service in the heroic attempt to 
save the lives of the people in danger;

Whereas in the immediate aftermath of the attacks, thou-
sands of recovery workers, including trades personnel, 
iron workers, equipment operators, and many others, 
joined with uniformed officers and military personnel to 
help search for and recover victims lost in the attacks; 
Whereas in the days, weeks, and months following the at-
tacks, thousands of people in the United States and oth-
ers spontaneously volunteered to help support the rescue 
and recovery efforts, braving both physical and emotional 
hardship; 
Whereas many first responders, rescue and recovery workers, 
volunteers, and survivors of the attacks continue to suffer 
from serious medical illnesses and emotional distress re-
lated to the physical and mental trauma of the tragedy; 
Whereas hundreds of thousands of brave men and women 
continue to serve every day, having answered the call to 
duty as members of the Armed Forces, with some having 
given their lives or suffered injury to defend the security 
of the United States and prevent further terrorist at-
tacks; 
Whereas all people of the United States witnessed and en-
dured the tragedy of September 11, 2001, and, in the im-
mediate aftermath of the attacks, became unified under 
a remarkable spirit of service and compassion that in-
spired the people of the United States; 
Whereas in the years immediately following the attacks of 
September 11, 2001, there was a marked increase in vol-
unteerism and national service among the people of the 
United States, which continues to this day; 
Whereas in 2009, Congress passed and President Barack 
Obama signed the bipartisan Serve America Act (Public

Law 111–13; 123 Stat. 1460), which established, at the 
request of the 9/11 community, Federal recognition of 
September 11 as a ‘‘National Day of Service and Re-
membrance’’ and charged the Corporation for National 
and Community Service with leading this annual day of 
service; 
Whereas since Congress and the President provided for Fed-
eral recognition of September 11 as a ‘‘National Day of 
Service and Remembrance’’ (commonly referred to as ‘‘9/ 
11 Day’’), millions of people in the United States observe 
the anniversary by engaging in a wide range of service 
activities and private forms of prayer and remembrance; 
and 
Whereas during the current COVID–19 national emergency, 
Americans have once again rallied together to rise to the 
challenge by caring for the sick, providing essential serv-
ices, and volunteering in their communities: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
