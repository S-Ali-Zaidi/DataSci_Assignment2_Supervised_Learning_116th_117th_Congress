SEC. 2. AIRBORNE ULTRAFINE PARTICLE STUDY. 
1
(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 180 days after the 
2
date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the 
3
Federal Aviation Administration, jointly with the Adminis-
4
trator of the Environmental Protection Agency, shall enter 
5
into an agreement with an eligible institution of higher 
6
education to conduct a study examining airborne ultrafine 
7
particles and their effect on human health. 
8
(b) SCOPE OF STUDY.—The study conducted under 
9
subsection (a) shall— 
10
(1) summarize the relevant literature and stud-
11
ies done on airborne ultrafine particles worldwide; 
12
(2) focus on large hub commercial airports in— 
13
(A) Seattle; 
14
(B) Boston; 
15
(C) Chicago; 
16
(D) New York; 
17
(E) the Northern California Metroplex; 
18
(F) Phoenix; 
19
(G) the Southern California Metroplex; 
20
(H) the District of Columbia; and 
21
(I) Atlanta; 
22
(3) examine airborne ultrafine particles and 
23
their effect on human health, including— 
24
(A) characteristics of UFPs present in the 
25
air;

(B) spatial and temporal distributions of 
1
UFP concentrations; 
2
(C) primary sources of UFPs; 
3
(D) the contribution of aircraft and airport 
4
operations to the distribution of UFP con-
5
centrations when compared to other sources; 
6
(E) potential health effects associated with 
7
elevated UFP exposures, including outcomes re-
8
lated to cardiovascular disease, respiratory in-
9
fection 
and 
disease, 
degradation 
of 
10
neurocognitive functions, and other health ef-
11
fects, that have been considered in previous 
12
studies; and 
13
(F) potential UFP exposures, especially to 
14
susceptible and vulnerable groups; 
15
(4) identify measures, including the use of sus-
16
tainable aviation fuels, intended to reduce emissions 
17
from aircraft and airport operations and assess po-
18
tential effects on emissions related to UFPs; and 
19
(5) identify information gaps related to under-
20
standing relationships between UFP exposures and 
21
health effects, contributions of aviation-related emis-
22
sions to UFP exposures, and the effectiveness of 
23
mitigation measures.

(c) ELIGIBILITY.—An institution of higher education 
1
is eligible to conduct the study if the institution— 
2
(1) is located in one of the areas identified in 
3
subsection (b); 
4
(2) applies to the Administrator of the Federal 
5
Aviation Administration in a timely fashion; 
6
(3) demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Ad-
7
ministrator that the institution is qualified to con-
8
duct the study; 
9
(4) agrees to submit to the Administrator, not 
10
later than 2 years after entering into an agreement 
11
under subsection (a), the results of the study, in-
12
cluding any source materials used; and 
13
(5) meets such other requirements as the Ad-
14
ministrator determines necessary. 
15
(d) COORDINATION.—The Administrator may coordi-
16
nate with the Administrator of the Environmental Protec-
17
tion Agency, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, 
18
and any other agency head whom the Administrator deems 
19
appropriate to provide data and other assistance necessary 
20
for the study. 
21
(e) REPORT.—Not later than 180 days after submis-
22
sion of the results of the study by the institution of higher 
23
education, the Administrator shall submit to the Com-
24
