SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
1
It is the sense of Congress that— 
2
(1) the United States has made tremendous 
3
progress towards ending the COVID–19 pandemic 
4
within its borders, thanks to an unprecedented and 
5
highly successful vaccination campaign spearheaded 
6
by the Biden administration; 
7
(2) beyond those borders, the pandemic con-
8
tinues to rage unchecked across much of the world 
9
as global vaccination efforts have struggled to keep 
10
pace; 
11
(3) if current trends continue, many middle-in-
12
come countries may not achieve widespread vaccina-
13
tion until late 2022, and the world’s poorest nations 
14
will likely not reach widespread vaccination coverage 
15
before 2023, if at all; 
16
(4) this situation threatens progress toward 
17
ending the COVID–19 pandemic here in the United 
18
States, as unchecked transmission of COVID–19 
19
gives rise to new variants, many of which show vac-
20
cine-resistance; 
21
(5) the most concerning of these variants has 
22
been shown to reduce vaccine efficacy by as much as 
23
20 to 40 percent; and 
24
(6) to protect American citizens from the emer-
25
gence of new vaccine-resistant coronavirus variants

and to prevent the kind of humanitarian catastrophe 
1
currently occurring in South Asia, South America, 
2
and elsewhere, the United States should take up the 
3
mantle of global leadership in the fight to end the 
4
COVID–19 pandemic.

6
GRAM. 
7
(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—There is established the 
8
‘‘Pandemic Preparedness and Response Program’’ (in this 
9
Act referred to as the ‘‘Program’’) to be responsible for 
10
and provide oversight over the United States government- 
11
wide global health response to the COVID–19 pandemic 
12
and protect Americans from the emergence of COVID– 
13
19 variants and other pathogens with pandemic potential. 
14
(b) DIRECTOR.—The Director of the Program shall

the role of the United States in the work of international 
19
non-governmental organizations, development banks, civil 
20
society, and foreign governments, with respect to the glob-
21
al health response to the COVID–19 pandemic and the 
22
prevention of the emergence of variants or of other patho-
23
gens with pandemic potential.

SEC. 4. IMPLEMENTATION OF COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY. 
1
(a) IMPLEMENTATION.—In implementing the strat-
2
egy developed pursuant to section 3(d)— 
3
(1) the Director of the Program shall— 
4
(A) ensure the immediate release of the 
5
80,000,000 doses of vaccine that the United 
6
States has already committed to send abroad; 
7
(B) reassess the United States vaccine 
8
stockpile with regard to domestic vaccination 
9
objectives and trends to determine whether fur-
10
ther vaccines can be sent abroad; 
11
(C) coordinate with the Biomedical Ad-
12
vanced Research and Development Authority of 
13
the Department of Health and Human Services 
14
(BARDA) to rapidly scale manufacturing ca-
15
pacity around the world, both in the United 
16
States and in regional manufacturing hubs, to 
17
whatever degree necessary and wherever nec-
18
essary, to produce 8,000,000,000 vaccine doses 
19
as soon as possible, in addition to existing man-
20
ufacturing capacity; 
21
(D) consider the potential benefit of re-
22
gional manufacturing hubs in South America, 
23
Africa and South Asia for the future of global 
24
health more generally, and especially the poten-
25
tial benefit for addressing future pandemics

pursuant to paragraph (3); 
2
(E) encourage and facilitate technology 
3
sharing and the licensing of intellectual prop-
4
erty as much as is necessary to ensure an ade-
5
quate and timely supply of necessary articles;

(F) in collaboration with COVAX, ensure 
7
equitable access to vaccines, especially those 
8
produced through the efforts of BARDA and 
9
the Program as described in subparagraph (3) 
10
and paragraph (2); 
11
(G) work with international partners to 
12
provide enough vaccines to lower- and middle- 
13
income countries to fully vaccinate at least 60 
14
percent of their respective populations, with 
15
special attention to the 92 lower- and middle- 
16
income countries identified by the COVAX ini-
17
tiative as being the most in need of assistance;

that community engagement and public aware-
21
ness will play in ensuring the voluntary uptake 
22

2
mental organizations to develop in-country in-
3
frastructure, personnel and other assets suffi-
4
cient to deliver vaccines where they are needed, 
5
when they are needed, and to administer the 
6
vaccines to appropriate target populations;

infrastructure 
and 
relationships 
developed

through the President’s Emergency Plan For 
10
AIDS Relief and other pre-existing, bilateral 
11
humanitarian aid programs between the United

States and the target countries, as well as 
13
through pre-existing multilateral relationships 
14
and initiatives in target countries; 
15
(C) develop country operational plans tar-
16
geted primarily at lower- and middle-income 
17
countries without the infrastructure to manu-
18
facture, acquire, or administer vaccines on their 
19
own; 
20
(D) monitor how many people in such tar-
21
get countries received inoculations, the infection

updates on the overall progress in non-targeted

countries toward vaccinating their populations

and ending the COVID–19 pandemic within 
4
their borders, to ensure that the Director re-
5
mains aware of overall global progress toward 
6
vaccinating the global population and ending 
7
the COVID–19 pandemic worldwide; and

COVID–19 pandemic, the Program should shift to 
10
protect against future pandemics by coordinating a 
11
global disease surveillance network to identify and 
12
stop pathogens with pandemic potential before they 
13
spread uncontrollably by— 
14
(A) building on existing surveillance and 
15
prevention infrastructure and relationships de-
16
veloped through the National Security Council 
17
Directorate on Global Health Security and Bio-
18
defense as well as other pre-existing surveillance 
19
and prevention programs; 
20
(B) working with international partners to 
21
establish a coordinated disease surveillance sys-
22
tem, directly linked to decision-makers in for-
23
eign governments and non-governmental organi-
24
zations, such that certain agreed early-warning

metrics would trigger timely and open commu-

between 
relevant 
decision-makers

around the world; and 
3
(C) in addition to monitoring for early- 
4
warning signs of potential future pandemics,

consider how to prevent or limit the potential 
6
for new spillover events by which new pathogens

with pandemic potential are first transmitted to

humans.

(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
10
gress that— 
11
(1) the United States Government played a cru-

the COVID–19 vaccines, substantially funding sev-
14
eral vaccine candidates and closely collaborating with 
15
Moderna on the NIH-Moderna vaccine; and 
16
(2) in the face of a global health emergency, the 
17
United States Government has broad authority, in-
18
cluding under the Defense Production Act (50 
19
