A BILL 
To help States combat abuse of occupational licensing laws 
by economic incumbents, to promote competition, to en-
courage innovation, to protect consumers, and to facili-
tate the restoration of antitrust immunity to State occu-
pational boards, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Restoring Board Im-
4
munity Act of 2021’’ or the ‘‘RBI Act’’.

SEC. 2. STATEMENT OF FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
00:42 Jun 12, 2021
H3147
2 
•HR 3147 IH
(1) The prevalence of occupational licensing has 
1
increased dramatically in recent decades, in part be-
2
cause private interests have sought licensing in order 
3
to limit competition. 
4
(2) Occupational licensing often limits opportu-
5
nities for workers, frustrates entrepreneurs seeking 
6
to introduce new business models, and raises prices 
7
paid by consumers. 
8
(3) Licensing should be imposed only to combat 
9
real, substantial threats to public health, safety, or 
10
welfare and only where other less restrictive regu-
11
latory alternatives are insufficient to protect con-
12
sumers and serve the public interest. 
13
(4) Regulators should consider a range of less 
14
restrictive alternatives before enacting an occupa-
15
tional licensing regime, which may include inspec-
16
tions, bonding or insurance requirements, registra-
17
tion, and voluntary certification. 
18
(5) Voluntary certification provides a particu-
19
larly significant alternative to licensure, as it allows 
20
market participants to signal to consumers the at-
21
tainment of personal qualifications without limiting 
22
entry into the marketplace. 
23
(6) The failure of State governments to adopt 
24
less restrictive alternatives to licensing, and less bur-
25
00:42 Jun 12, 2021
H3147
3 
•HR 3147 IH
densome requirements in those areas where licensing 
1
is deemed necessary, has resulted in significant costs 
2
to consumers and the broader economy. 
3
(7) The United States Supreme Court re-
4
sponded to these concerns in North Carolina Board 
5
of Dental Examiners v. FTC, 135 S. Ct. 1101 
6
(2015), holding that self-interested licensing boards 
7
may be subject to liability under the antitrust laws, 
8
but that decision has also created significant uncer-
9
tainty for the States and their licensing boards. 
10
(8) Some States have responded to the decision 
11
in North Carolina Board of Dental Examiners by es-
12
tablishing a layer of bureaucratic oversight that 
13
merely monitors board actions for consistency with 
14
State licensing laws. This response is a missed op-
15
portunity for reform, as it does not address the spe-
16
cific competition concern raised in North Carolina 
17
Board of Dental Examiners or the underlying prob-
18
lems with over-reliance on occupational licensure as 
19
a regulatory approach and with overly broad enforce-
20
ment of licensing laws as a means to regulate com-
21
mercial activities outside an occupation’s scope of 
22
practice. 
23
(9) Legislation is necessary to clarify the re-
24
quirements of active supervision, both to offer States 
25
00:42 Jun 12, 2021
H3147
4 
•HR 3147 IH
a clear and certain mechanism to immunize their oc-
1
cupational boards and to make clear that mere bu-
2
reaucratic oversight to ensure consistency with State 
3
licensing laws does not suffice to confer immunity. 
4
(10) This Act is intended to offer States a 
5
choice between two alternative routes to achieve im-
6
munity for their occupational licensing boards—ei-
7
ther establishing a mechanism for meaningful active 
8
supervision of licensing boards by State officials or 
9
establishing a mechanism for meaningful judicial re-
10
view of board actions in the State courts.

17
employee of that board acting in the official capacity of 
18
that member, officer, or employee, if— 
19

21
ized by a non-frivolous interpretation of the occupa-
22
tional licensing laws of the State; 
23
(2) the State adopts a policy of using less re-

(i) identifies an important government 
12
interest in protecting against real, substan-
13
tial threats to public health, safety, or wel-
14
fare; and 
15
(ii) demonstrates that the occupa-
16
tional licensing law is substantially related 
17
to achievement of the important govern-
18
ment interest described in clause (i), in 
19
light of the availability of less restrictive 
20
alternatives to occupational licensing;

injunctive relief against enforcement of an

(D) provide for an award of reasonable 
17
costs and attorney fees to a person who success-
18

under subparagraph (B); or

paragraph (A) has been met; and 
4
(2) may not authorize a court to—

(A) uphold enforcement of an occupational

licensing law of the State simply because the

court believes the law is rationally related to a

legitimate governmental purpose;

another person or entity, rather than exercising

independent review; or
