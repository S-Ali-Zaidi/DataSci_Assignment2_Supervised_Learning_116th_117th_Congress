American colonies between 1619 and 1865 and to estab-
lish a commission to study and consider a national apol-
ogy and proposal for reparations for the institution of

priate remedies, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. 
7
(a) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds that— 
8
(1) approximately 4,000,000 Africans and their 
9
descendants were enslaved in the United States and 
10
colonies that became the United States from 1619 to 
11
1865;

•HR 40 IH
(2) the institution of slavery was constitu-
1
tionally and statutorily sanctioned by the Govern-
2
ment of the United States from 1789 through 1865; 
3
(3) the slavery that flourished in the United 
4
States constituted an immoral and inhumane depri-
5
vation of Africans’ life, liberty, African citizenship 
6
rights, and cultural heritage, and denied them the 
7
fruits of their own labor; 
8
(4) a preponderance of scholarly, legal, commu-
9
nity evidentiary documentation and popular culture 
10
markers constitute the basis for inquiry into the on- 
11
going effects of the institution of slavery and its leg-
12
acy of persistent systemic structures of discrimina-
13
tion on living African Americans and society in the 
14
United States; 
15
(5) following the abolition of slavery the United 
16
States Government, at the Federal, State, and local 
17
level, continued to perpetuate, condone and often 
18
profit from practices that continued to brutalize and 
19
disadvantage African Americans, including share 
20
cropping, convict leasing, Jim Crow, redlining, un-
21
equal education, and disproportionate treatment at 
22
the hands of the criminal justice system; and 
23
(6) as a result of the historic and continued dis-
24
crimination, African Americans continue to suffer

debilitating economic, educational, and health hard-

ships including but not limited to having nearly 
2
1,000,000 Black people incarcerated; an unemploy-
3
ment rate more than twice the current White unem-
4
ployment rate; and an average of less than 1⁄16 of 
5
the wealth of White families, a disparity which has 
6
worsened, not improved over time.

(b) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act is to estab-
8
lish a commission to study and develop Reparation pro-
9
posals for African Americans as a result of— 
10
(1) the institution of slavery, including both the 
11
Trans-Atlantic and the domestic ‘‘trade’’ which ex-
12
isted from 1565 in colonial Florida and from 1619 
13
through 1865 within the other colonies that became 
14
the United States, and which included the Federal 
15
and State governments which constitutionally and 
16
statutorily supported the institution of slavery; 
17
(2) the de jure and de facto discrimination 
18
against freed slaves and their descendants from the 
19
end of the Civil War to the present, including eco-
20
nomic, political, educational, and social discrimina-
21
tion;

23

3
structional resources and technologies are being used 
4
to deny the inhumanity of slavery and the crime 
5
against humanity of people of African descent in the 
6
United States; 
7
(5) the role of Northern complicity in the 
8
Southern based institution of slavery;

as understood by various relevant international 
11
protocols, laws, and findings.

petration of gross human rights violations and

17
their descendants. 
18
(C) How Federal laws and policies that 
19
continue to disproportionately and negatively 
20
affect African Americans as a group, and those 
21
that perpetuate the lingering effects, materially 
22
and psycho-social, can be eliminated.

24
