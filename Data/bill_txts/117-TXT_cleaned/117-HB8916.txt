To establish leave policies of the Armed Forces for a member 
to seek an abortion. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Access to Reproductive 
4
Care for Servicemembers Act’’.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 8916 IH
(1) Following the Supreme Court’s decision to 
1
eliminate the right to abortion, States across the 
2
country are moving swiftly to ban abortion access, 
3
leading to even greater barriers to care for military 
4
families. 
5
(2) Access to abortion care is essential to a per-
6
son’s health and central to their economic and social 
7
well-being. Bans and restrictions on abortion delay 
8
access to abortion care and therefore increase costs 
9
for members of the Armed Forces seeking care. The 
10
consequence of these delays and barriers could mean 
11
that a person is forced to carry a pregnancy against 
12
their will. 
13
(3) The Armed Forces have a large presence in 
14
many States poised to ban or restrict access to abor-
15
tion, many of which also neighbor States that would 
16
likely ban abortion. 
17
(4) Members of the Armed Forces seeking care 
18
off-base may be limited in their ability to do so due 
19
to restrictions on leave or travel restrictions imposed 
20
by their unit. 
21
(5) Restrictions on receiving approval to take 
22
leave for abortion care interfere with a member of 
23
the Armed Forces’ health, well-being, and right to 
24
access the care they need. The decision to terminate

•HR 8916 IH
a pregnancy should not depend on the discretion or 
1
judgment of a military commander. 
2
(6) The Army has recognized that abortion is 
3
a time sensitive-procedure and access should not be 
4
delayed for members or military families. 
5
(7) When a member of the Armed Forces de-
6
cides to obtain an abortion, it should be available, 
7
affordable, private, and free from punishment, re-
8
prisal, or judgment by the member’s chain of com-
9
mand. 
10
(8) The harms of abortion-specific restrictions 
11
fall most heavily on people who already face barriers 
12
to accessing health care including people with low in-
13
comes, such as junior members, and Black, Indige-
14
nous, and people of color, immigrants, young people, 
15
people with disabilities, the LGBTQI+ community, 
16
and those stationed in rural and other medically un-
17
derserved areas. 
18
(9) Equal access to abortion care, everywhere, 
19
is essential to social and economic participation, 
20
equality, reproductive autonomy, and the right to de-
21
termine a person’s own life. 
22
(10) The denial of leave for an abortion or any 
23
other reproductive health service violates the rights 
24
of members of the Armed Forces. Access to care for 
25

•HR 8916 IH
military families should not be determined by the 
1
personal beliefs of others. 
2
(11) In addition to the health and well-being 
3
implications for members of the Armed Forces and 
4
their families, the failure to address these issues will 
5
contribute to the challenges that the Armed Forces 
6
faces in attracting and retaining personnel, thereby 
7
negatively affecting military strength and readiness.

SEC. 3. LEAVE FOR A MEMBER OF THE ARMED FORCES FOR 
9
ABORTION. 
10
(a) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary concerned (as such 
11
term is defined in section 101 of title 10, United States 
12
Code) shall, with regards to abortion care for a member 
13
of the Armed Forces— 
14
(1) consider such care to be time-sensitive and 
15
therefore approve leave for such abortion care; and 
16
(2) not require the member to disclose to a 
17
commanding officer the time-sensitive care or proce-
18
dure being received during such leave. 
19
(b) REIMBURSEMENT FOR TRAVEL.—In a jurisdic-
20
tion where abortion is prohibited or inaccessible, the Sec-
21
retary concerned shall reimburse the member for costs in-
22
curred by the member to travel to a different jurisdiction 
23
for an abortion.
