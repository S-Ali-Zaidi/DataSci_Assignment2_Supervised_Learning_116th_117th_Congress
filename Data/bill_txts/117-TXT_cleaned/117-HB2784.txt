A BILL 
To amend the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act 
to create a new national program to support mid-career 
workers, including workers from underrepresented popu-
lations, in reentering the STEM workforce, by providing 
funding to small- and medium-sized STEM businesses 
so the businesses can offer paid internships or other 
returnships that lead to positions above entry level. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘STEM Restoring Em-
2
ployment Skills through Targeted Assistance, Re-entry, 
3
and Training Act’’ or the ‘‘STEM RESTART Act’’.

SEC. 2. RETURNING SKILLED WORKERS TO THE STEM 
5
WORKFORCE. 
6
(a) IN GENERAL.—Subtitle D of title I of the Work-
7
force Innovation and Opportunity Act is amended— 
8
(1) by redesignating section 172 (29 U.S.C. 
9
3227) as section 173; and 
10
(2) by inserting after section 171 the following: 
11
‘‘SEC. 172. GRANTS TO SUPPORT SKILLED WORKERS IN RE-
12
TURNING OR TRANSITIONING TO THE STEM 
13
WORKFORCE. 
14
‘‘(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
15
‘‘(1) The Brookings Institution expects the 
16
coronavirus pandemic will have lasting effects on the 
17
labor market and could change the composition of 
18
available jobs indefinitely, with the ensuing economic 
19
decline ushering in a new era of automation. Em-
20
ployers will likely shed less skilled workers and re-
21
place them with higher-skilled technology workers, 
22
which increases labor productivity as a recession 
23
tapers off. 
24
‘‘(2) The current pipeline of engineering talent 
25
does not include many college graduates from large 
26

•HR 2784 IH
cohorts of the population. Women represent over 57 
1
percent of college graduates but only 22 percent of 
2
the engineers entering the workforce. Within the 
3
workforce, only 14 percent of engineers are women. 
4
Women also leave the engineering profession in 
5
greater numbers than men do. 
6
‘‘(3) A 2018 Pew Research Center study 
7
showed there are wide racial gaps among current 
8
STEM workers regarding reasons why so few Black 
9
and Hispanic people work in STEM. For example, 
10
over 70 percent of Black STEM workers view lack 
11
of access to education and discriminatory hiring and 
12
promotion practices as reasons there are so few 
13
Black men and women in the STEM fields. By com-
14
parison, less than 30 percent of White and Asian 
15
STEM workers view that lack of access and those 
16
practices as barriers to Black people entering the 
17
fields. Additionally, 62 percent of Black STEM 
18
workers say they have faced discrimination in their 
19
jobs compared to just 13 percent of White STEM 
20
workers. 
21
‘‘(4) Among the 25,300,000 United States 
22
women ages 25 through 54 with a bachelor’s degree 
23
or higher degree in 2017, 4,200,000 were out of the 
24
labor force. While some of those women were dis-
25

•HR 2784 IH
abled or retired, the remaining 3,600,000 women 
1
may be candidates to return to work. 
2
‘‘(5) The Center for Talent Innovation’s re-
3
search shows that while 93 percent of women who 
4
left the workforce want to resume their careers, only 
5
74 percent manage to get any kind of job at all and 
6
just 40 percent successfully return to work full-time. 
7
‘‘(6) Mid-career internship and other returnship 
8
programs are an effective way to address the dif-
9
ficulties of former STEM employees seeking to re-
10
turn to work, as the programs provide a proba-
11
tionary period and also an opportunity to obtain 
12
mentorship, professional development, and support 
13
as the participants transition back to work. Even 
14
more important, returnship programs allow an em-
15
ployer to base a hiring decision on an actual work 
16
sample instead of a series of interviews. At the same 
17
time, the programs give participants an opportunity 
18
to return to work together, in a cohort of similarly 
19
situated returners. 
20
‘‘(7) Fortune 500 companies like Apple, Honey-
21
well, Northrop Grumman, Ingersoll Rand, and The 
22
Procter & Gamble Company have taken the initiative 
23
to try to close the gender gap among STEM profes-
24
sionals by providing mid-career internships for re-

turning technical professionals. However, a 2008 
1
study by Anthony Breitzman and Diana Hicks for 
2
the Office of Advocacy of the Small Business Admin-
3
istration, entitled ‘An Analysis of Small Business 
4
Patents by Industry and Firm Size’, found that 
5
‘Small firms are much more likely to develop emerg-
6
ing technologies than are large firms. This is per-
7
haps intuitively reasonable given theories on small 
8
firms effecting technological change, but the quan-
9
titative data here support this assertion. Specifically, 
10
although small firms account for only 8 percent of 
11
patents granted, they account for 24 percent of the 
12
patents in the top 100 emerging clusters.’.
