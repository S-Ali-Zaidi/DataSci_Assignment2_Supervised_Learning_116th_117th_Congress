SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
6
It is the sense of Congress that— 
7

safety education kits, which include firearm locking 
1
devices and informational materials, to firearm own-
2
ers in all 50 states and 5 U.S. territories. 
3
(2) In addition to providing for the secure stor-
4
age of countless firearms, these actions have raised 
5
awareness about safe and responsible firearm owner-
6
ship and the importance of storing firearms securely 
7
when not in use, which has proven effective in pre-
8
venting unauthorized access to firearms thereby re-
9
ducing and preventing accidents, theft, and misuse, 
10
including suicide. 
11
(3) Federal investment in enhancing and ex-
12
panding these efforts is critical to educating a 
13
broader proportion of the public while keeping oper-
14
able firearms out of the hands of those who cannot 
15
be trusted to use them responsibly.
