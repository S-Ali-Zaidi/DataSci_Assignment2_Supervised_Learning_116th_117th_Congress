SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS. 
1
The Congress finds that— 
2
(1) 30 percent of the population of the United 
3
States and 50 percent of the gross domestic product 
4
of the United States is located on the Atlantic coast 
5
or the Gulf of Mexico coast, areas frequently hit by 
6
coastal storms and hurricanes; 
7
(2) 90 percent of all natural disasters involve 
8
flooding; 
9
(3) all 50 States have experienced floods and 
10
flash floods between 2015 and 2020; 
11
(4) in most States, enrollment in the National 
12
Flood Insurance Program has decreased between 15 
13
and 35 percent since 2011; 
14
(5) some of the poorest, most disenfranchised 
15
populations live in floodplains because the land is 
16
cheaper and moving out of such areas is not a fea-
17
sible solution; and 
18
(6) such communities are significantly impacted 
19
by floods and other extreme weather events and are 
20
often less equipped to rebuild or relocate afterwards.
