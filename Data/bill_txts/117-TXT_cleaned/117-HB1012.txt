Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘ ‘Six Triple Eight’ Con-
4
gressional Gold Medal Act of 2021’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) On July 1, 1943, President Franklin D. 
8
Roosevelt signed into law legislation that established 
9
the Women’s Army Corps (referred to in this section 
10
as the ‘‘WAC’’) as a component in the Army. The 
11
WAC was converted from the Women’s Army Auxil-
12
iary Corps (referred to in this section as the 
13
‘‘WAAC’’), which had been created in 1942 without 
14
official military status. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt 
15
and Mary McLeod Bethune, the founder of the Na-
16
tional Council of Negro Women, advocated for the 
17
admittance of African-American women into the 
18
newly formed WAC to serve as officers and enlisted 
19
personnel. 
20
(2) Dubbed ‘‘10 percenters’’, the recruitment of 
21
African-American women to the WAAC was limited 
22
to 10 percent of the population of the WAAC to 
23
match the proportion of African Americans in the 
24
national population. Despite an Executive order 
25

•HR 1012 IH
issued by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1941 
1
banning racial discrimination in civilian defense in-
2
dustries, the Armed Forces remained segregated. 
3
Enlisted women served in segregated units, partici-
4
pated in segregated training, lived in separate quar-
5
ters, ate at separate tables in mess halls, and used 
6
segregated recreational facilities. Officers received 
7
their officer candidate training in integrated units 
8
but lived under segregated conditions. Specialist and 
9
technical training schools were integrated in 1943. 
10
During World War II, a total of 6,520 African- 
11
American women served in the WAAC and the 
12
WAC. 
13
(3) After several units of White women were 
14
sent to serve in the European Theater of Operations 
15
(referred to in this section as the ‘‘ETO’’) during 
16
World War II, African-American organizations advo-
17
cated for the War Department to extend the oppor-
18
tunity to serve overseas to African-American WAC 
19
units. 
20
(4) In November 1944, the War Department 
21
approved sending African-American women to serve 
22
in Europe. A battalion of all African-American 
23
women drawn from the WAC, the Army Service 
24
Forces, and the Army Air Forces was created and 
25

designated as the 6888th Central Postal Directory 
1
Battalion (referred to in this section as the 
2
‘‘6888th’’), which was nicknamed the ‘‘Six Triple 
3
Eight’’. 
4
(5) Army officials reported a shortage of quali-
5
fied postal officers within the ETO, which resulted 
6
in a backlog of undelivered mail. As Allied forces 
7
drove across Europe, the ever-changing locations of 
8
servicemembers hampered the delivery of mail to 
9
those servicemembers. Because 7,000,000 civilians 
10
and military personnel from the United States 
11
served in the ETO, many of those individuals had 
12
identical names. For example, 7,500 such individuals 
13
were named Robert Smith. One general predicted 
14
that the backlog in Birmingham, England, would 
15
take 6 months to process and the lack of reliable 
16
mail service was hurting morale. 
17
(6) In February 1945, the 6888th arrived in 
18
Birmingham. Upon their arrival, the 6888th found 
19
warehouses filled with millions of pieces of mail in-
20
tended for members of the Armed Forces, United 
21
States Government personnel, and Red Cross work-
22
ers serving in the ETO. 
23
(7) The 6888th created effective processes and 
24
filing systems to track individual servicemembers, 
25

•HR 1012 IH
organize ‘‘undeliverable’’ mail, determine the in-
1
tended recipient for insufficiently addressed mail, 
2
and handle mail addressed to servicemembers who 
3
had died. Adhering to their motto of ‘‘No mail, low 
4
morale’’, the women processed an average of 65,000 
5
pieces of mail per shift and cleared the 6-month 
6
backlog of mail within 3 months. 
7
(8) The 6888th traveled to Rouen, France in 
8
May 1945 and worked through a separate backlog of 
9
undelivered mail dating back as far as 3 years. 
10
(9) At the completion of their mission, the unit 
11
returned to the United States. The 6888th was dis-
12
continued on March 9, 1946, at Camp Kilmer, New 
13
Jersey. 
14
(10) The accomplishments of the 6888th in Eu-
15
rope encouraged the General Board, United States 
16
Forces, European Theater of Operations to adopt 
17
the following premise in their study of the WAC 
18
issued in December 1945: ‘‘[T]he national security 
19
program is the joint responsibility of all Americans 
20
irrespective of color or sex’’ and ‘‘the continued use 
21
of colored, along with white, female military per-
22
sonnel is required in such strength as is proportion-
23
ately appropriate to the relative population distribu-
24
tion between colored and white races’’.

(11) With the exception of smaller units of Af-
1
rican-American nurses who served in Africa, Aus-
2
tralia, and England, the 6888th was the only Afri-
3
can-American Women’s Army Corps unit to serve 
4
overseas during World War II. 
5
(12) The members of the ‘‘Six Triple Eight’’ re-
6
ceived the European African Middle Eastern Cam-
7
paign Medal, the Women’s Army Corps Service 
8
Medal, and the World War II Victory Medal for 
9
their service. 
10
(13) In 2019, the Army awarded the 6888th 
11
the Meritorious Unit Commendation.
