A BILL 
To review current restrictions on travel to North Korea, 
call for a formal end to the Korean War, and for other 
purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Peace on the Korean 
4
Peninsula Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress makes the following findings: 
7
(1) On July 27, 1953, the commander in chief 
8
of the United Nations Command signed an armistice

•HR 3446 IH
agreement with the supreme commander of the 
1
North Korean People’s Army and the commander of 
2
the Chinese People’s Volunteers, aiming to ‘‘insure 
3
a complete cessation of hostilities and of all acts of 
4
armed force in Korea until a final peaceful settle-
5
ment is achieved’’. 
6
(2) The armistice agreement neither formally 
7
ended the war nor represented a final peaceful set-
8
tlement. 
9
(3) On April 27, 2018, in Panmunjom, the 
10
leaders of South Korea and North Korea declared 
11
that ‘‘a new era of peace has begun on the Korean 
12
peninsula’’, and committed ‘‘to declare the end of 
13
war’’ on the Korean peninsula 65 years after the 
14
signing of the armistice agreement. 
15
(4) In its roll out of its policy towards North 
16
Korea, the Biden Administration expressed support 
17
for the Singapore framework, which identifies peace 
18
on the Korean peninsula as an objective of any fu-
19
ture negotiations between the United States and 
20
North Korea. 
21
(5) The United States should pursue a sus-
22
tained and credible diplomatic process to achieve an 
23
end to the Korean war, and every effort should be 
24

made to avoid military confrontation with North 
1
Korea. 
2
(6) The persistence of a state of war does not 
3
serve the national interest of the United States and 
4
its allies. 
5
(7) One major consequence of the continuation 
6
of the Korean war is that the United States does not 
7
have formal relations with North Korea, which has 
8
prevented Korean Americans with relatives in North 
9
Korea from seeing their families. 
10
(8) Approximately 100,000 Americans have rel-
11
atives living in North Korea. 
12
(9) At the Hanoi Summit in February 2019, 
13
the United States and North Korea discussed for-
14
mally ending the Korean war and the exchange of 
15
diplomatic liaison offices, however these discussions 
16
did not advance due to a stalemate on nuclear and 
17
missile issues. 
18
(10) The ongoing nuclear- and ballistic-missile- 
19
related activities of North Korea continue to pose a 
20
threat to international peace and security.
