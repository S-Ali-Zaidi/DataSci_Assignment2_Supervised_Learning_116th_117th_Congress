SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6

(2) The battle of Fort Pillow was fought on 
1
April 12, 1864, at Fort Pillow in Henning, Ten-
2
nessee, during the American Civil War. 
3
(3) At Fort Pillow, Tennessee, Confederate 
4
forces never defeated the Union Navy. Instead, they 
5
perpetrated a heinous massacre after violating a flag 
6
of truce by advantageously repositioning rebel troops 
7
and by looting government buildings and private 
8
storefronts surrounding the fort. 
9
(4) According to the 1864 Report ‘‘Fort Pillow 
10
Massacre’’ from the United States Congress Joint 
11
Committee on the Conduct of the War, ‘‘The officers 
12
and men seem to vie with each other in the devilish 
13
work; men, women and even children, wherever 
14
found, were deliberately shot down, beaten and 
15
hacked with sabers. . . .’’. 
16
(5) The Union garrison consisted of 19 officers 
17
and 538 troops of whom 262 were United States 
18
Colored Troops (U.S.C.T.). 
19
(6) Per the report, ‘‘Of the men, from three 
20
hundred to four hundred are known to have been 
21
killed at Fort Pillow, of whom at least three hundred 
22
were murdered in cold blood after the fort was in 
23
possession of the rebels and our men had thrown 
24
down their arms and ceased to offer resistance.’’.

(7) The massacre at Fort Pillow demonstrated 
1
to all U.S.C.T. that surrender was not an option. 
2
The massacre at Fort Pillow became a rallying cry 
3
and motivation for the 209,147 U.S.C.T. 
4
(8) The 209,147 U.S.C.T. fundamentally con-
5
tributed to the Union’s defeat of the Confederacy. 
6
(9) The State of Tennessee allows the wrongful 
7
modification of the historical record by claiming it 
8
was a battle without a massacre of hundreds of sur-
9
rendering Union troops and innocent civilians. 
10
(10) In 1971, Fort Pillow became a State park. 
11
(11) In 1973, Fort Pillow was added to the Na-
12
tional Register of Historic Places. 
13
(12) The following year, in 1974, Fort Pillow 
14
was designated as a National Historic Landmark. 
15
(13) Fort Pillow Historic State Park consists of 
16
1,642 acres. 
17
(14) The Park contains several attraction areas 
18
such as a Civil War museum, hiking trail, camping 
19
ground, and picnic area. 
20
(15) This site deserves to become a National 
21
Battlefield Park due to its profound effect on 
22
U.S.C.T. and all Union forces in their fight to pre-
23
serve the United States of America.
