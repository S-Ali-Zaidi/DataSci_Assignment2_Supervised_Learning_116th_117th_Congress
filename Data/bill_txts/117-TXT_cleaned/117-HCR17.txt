Whereas the bonds constitute full faith and credit sovereign 
obligations of the internationally recognized Government 
of the People’s Republic of China; 
Whereas the People’s Republic of China subsequently de-
faulted on those bonds; 
Whereas the bonds constitute an unpaid general obligation of 
the Government of the People’s Republic of China; 
Whereas, under the successor government doctrine of settled 
international law (relating to establishing the continuity 
of obligations among successor governments), the repay-
ment obligation for the bonds is the obligation of the 
Government of the People’s Republic of China; 
Whereas the Government of the People’s Republic of China 
continues to refuse to repay the bonds held by United 
States citizens and has officially repudiated the debts, 
which is a clear violation of United States law, inter-
national law, and the rules and regulations of the World 
Bank and the International Monetary Fund; 
Whereas the Government of the People’s Republic of China 
honored repayment of the exact same bonds held by citi-
zens of the United Kingdom while rejecting the claims of 
citizens of the United States; 
Whereas, since the normalization of bilateral relations be-
tween the United States and the People’s Republic of 
China in the 1970s, the United States has shown good 
will to the People’s Republic of China by focusing on an 
expansion of bilateral trade while deferring discussion of 
repayment of the People’s Republic of China’s defaulted 
national debt; 
Whereas, under standard legal principles, the People’s Re-
public of China’s defaulted sovereign gold debt has been

gold bonds, American Bondholders Foundation, LLC, has 
proposed using the People’s Republic of China’s obliga-
tions as payment for the United States national debt to 
the People’s Republic of China; 
Whereas the Government of the People’s Republic of China 
covered up the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 
(commonly referred to as ‘‘COVID–19’’) during its early 
stages, resulting in a global pandemic and more than 
$2,000,000,000,000 in financial damage to the United 
States; and 
Whereas the United States Government pays its debts, and 
so should the Government of the People’s Republic of 
China: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate
