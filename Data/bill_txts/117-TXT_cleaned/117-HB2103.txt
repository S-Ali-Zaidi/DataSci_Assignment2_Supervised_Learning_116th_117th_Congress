section 1206 of the Foreign Relations Authorization 
2
Act, Fiscal Year 2003 (Public Law 107–228; 22 
3
U.S.C. 2321k note). 
4
(3) The unclassified summary of the 2018 Na-
5
tional Defense Strategy notably prioritized United 
6
States efforts to protect America’s allies and part-
7
ners, stating that United States defense objectives 
8
include ‘‘defending allies from military aggression, 
9
and bolstering partners against coercion, and fairly 
10
sharing responsibilities for common defense’’. 
11
(4) The Taiwan Relations Act (Public Law 96– 
12
8; 22 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.) states that ‘‘the United 
13
States will make available to Taiwan such defense 
14
articles and defense services in such quantity as may 
15
be necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a suffi-
16
cient self-defense capability’’. 
17
(5) Consistent with the Taiwan Relations Act, 
18
the United States Congress has for four decades ap-
19
proved numerous defense articles and defense serv-
20
ices for Taiwan’s self-defense, including, since 2017, 
21
High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), 
22
F–16 C/D fighter jets, MK 48 torpedoes, Harpoon

(6) Defense Security Cooperation Agency 
5
(DSCA) data indicates that Taiwan was the United 
6
States’ largest Foreign Military Sales customer in 
7
fiscal year 2020. 
8
(7) DSCA data also indicates that from fiscal 
9
years 1950 through 2020, Taiwan was the United 
10
States’ third-largest Foreign Military Sales cus-
11
tomer, tied with Japan. 
12
(8) The Taiwan Assurance Act of 2020 (sub-
13
title B of title III of division FF of Public Law 116– 
14
260), states, ‘‘the United States should conduct reg-
15
ular sales and transfers of defense articles to Tai-
16
wan in order to enhance its self-defense capabilities, 
17
particularly its efforts to develop and integrate 
18
asymmetric capabilities, including undersea warfare 
19
and air defense capabilities, into its military forces’’. 
20
(9) Subparagraph (A) of section 1260(b)(1) of 
21
the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal 
22
Year 2021 (Public Law 116–283) states, ‘‘[the

through foreign military sales, direct commercial

sales, and industrial cooperation, with an emphasis 
2
on capabilities that support the asymmetric defense 
3
strategy of Taiwan, including anti-ship, coastal de-
4
fense, anti-armor, air defense, undersea warfare, ad-
5
vanced command, control, communications, com-
6
puters, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, 
7
and resilient command and control capabilities.’’. 
8
(10) Subparagraph (B) of section 1260(b)(1) of 
9
such Act further states that the United States 
10
should continue supporting the development of de-
11
fense forces necessary for Taiwan to maintain a suf-
12
ficient self-defense capability by ‘‘ensuring timely re-
13
view of an response to response to requests of Tai-
14
wan for defense articles and services’’. 
15
(11) In its 2019 Recommendations to Congress, 
16
the bipartisan U.S.-China Economic and Security 
17
Commission issued the following judgement: ‘‘Con-
18
gress [should] raise the threshold of congressional 
19
notification on sales of defense articles and services 
20
to Taiwan to the highest tier set to U.S. allies and 
21
partners. Congress [should] also terminate any re-
22
quirement to provide prior notification of mainte-
23
nance and sustainment of military equipment and 
24
capabilities previously sold to Taiwan.’’.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
1
It is the sense of Congress that— 
2
(1) enhanced support for defense cooperation 
3
with Taiwan is critical to the national security of the 
4
United States, including through designation of Tai-
5
wan as a member of the colloquially titled ‘‘NATO 
6
Plus’’ community of states, which presently includes 
7
Japan, Australia, the Republic of Korea, Israel, and 
8
New Zealand, with respect to consideration by Con-
9
gress of Foreign Military Sales to Taiwan, as well 
10
as all other rights, privileges, and responsibilities af-
11
forded to such community of states; and 
12
(2) Taiwan should be so designated as a mem-
13
ber of the ‘‘NATO Plus’’ community of states.
