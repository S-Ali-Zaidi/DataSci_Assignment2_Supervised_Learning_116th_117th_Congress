(4) is coordinated between the community and an el-
ementary school, a secondary school, an institution of 
higher education, or a family community service program; 
Whereas family service learning— 
(1) is multigenerational learning that involves par-
ents, children, caregivers, and extended family members 
in shared learning experiences in physical and digital en-
vironments; 
(2) is integrated into and enhances the academic 
achievement of children or the educational components of 
a family service program in which families may be en-
rolled; and 
(3) promotes skills (such as investigation, planning, 
and preparation), action, reflection, the demonstration of 
results, and sustainability; 
Whereas family service learning has been shown to have posi-
tive multigenerational effects and encourages families to 
invest in their communities to improve economic and soci-
etal well-being; 
Whereas through family service learning, children and fami-
lies have the opportunity to solve community issues and 
learn together, thereby enabling the development of life 
and career skills, such as flexibility and adaptability, ini-
tiative and self-direction, social and cross-cultural skills, 
productivity and accountability, and leadership and re-
sponsibility; 
Whereas family service learning activities provide opportuni-
ties for families to improve essential skills, such as orga-
nization, research, planning, reading and writing, techno-
logical literacy, teamwork, and sharing;

Whereas families participating together in service are af-
forded quality time learning about their communities; 
Whereas adults engaged in family service learning serve as 
positive role models for their children; 
Whereas family service learning projects enable families to 
build substantive connections with their communities, de-
velop a stronger sense of self-worth, experience a reduc-
tion in social isolation, and improve parenting skills; 
Whereas family service learning has added benefits for 
English learners by helping individuals and families to— 
(1) feel more connected with their communities; and 
(2) practice language skills; 
Whereas family service learning is particularly important for 
at-risk families because family service learning— 
(1) provides opportunities for leadership and civic 
engagement; and 
(2) helps build the capacity to advocate for the 
needs of children and families; and 
Whereas the value that parents place on civic engagement 
and relationships within the community has been shown 
to transfer to children who, in turn, replicate important 
values, such as responsibility, empathy, and caring for 
others: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
