A BILL 
To require the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection to make certain determinations in enforcing 
the Jones Act, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Close Agency Loop-
4
holes to the Jones Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
17:32 Dec 27, 2022

•HR 9548 IH
(1) In 1920, Congress enacted the Merchant 
1
Marine Act (chapters 121 and 551 of title 46, 
2
United States Code), commonly referred to as the 
3
‘‘Jones Act’’. 
4
(2) In 1953, Congress enacted the Outer Conti-
5
nental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1331 et seq.) ap-
6
plying the Constitution, laws, and civil and political 
7
jurisdiction of the United States to the outer Conti-
8
nental Shelf. 
9
(3) In 2020, Congress enacted section 9503 of 
10
the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense 
11
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (Public Law 
12
116–283) affirming that application of the Constitu-
13
tion, laws, and civil and political jurisdiction of the 
14
United States to the outer Continental Shelf also ap-
15
plies to non-mineral energy resources and exploring 
16
for, developing, producing, transporting, or transmit-
17
ting such resources. 
18
(4) Therefore, the Jones Act prohibits the use 
19
of a non-Jones Act qualified vessel for the provision 
20
of any coastwise transportation of merchandise to or 
21
from a port of the United States (including terri-
22
tories or possessions to which the coastwise laws 
23
apply) to any point on the outer Continental Shelf, 
24
17:32 Dec 27, 2022
H9548

•HR 9548 IH
or between any two points on the outer Continental 
1
Shelf. 
2
(5) U.S. Customs and Border Protection (here-
3
inafter referred to as ‘‘CBP’’) is responsible for in-
4
terpreting and enforcing the Jones Act. CBP has 
5
issued ruling letters and other interpretative guid-
6
ance to requesting parties that provide the descrip-
7
tion of proposed activities. 
8
(6) Unlike most federal agencies, CBP is re-
9
quired by section 625(c) of the Tariff Act of 1930 
10
(19 U.S.C. 1625(c)) to follow its past interpretive 
11
guidance and treatments of ‘‘substantially identical 
12
transactions,’’ unless it institutes a public notice and 
13
comment process to modify or revoke that interpre-
14
tative guidance. As a result, CBP and market par-
15
ticipants treat as binding ruling letters and interpre-
16
tative guidance in addressing whether and how the 
17
Jones Act applies in substantially identical factual 
18
situations. 
19
(7) Thus, CBP’s ruling letters—even if legally 
20
incorrect—have substantial impacts: When CBP 
21
purports to authorize a foreign vessel to transport 
22
merchandise between coastwise points, unless or-
23
dered by a Federal court to rescind such ruling let-
24
ters, CBP does not take enforcement action against 
25
17:32 Dec 27, 2022
H9548
4 
•HR 9548 IH
other foreign vessels engaging in substantially iden-
1
tical transactions, and vessel operators accordingly 
2
rely on CBP’s past ruling letters and guidance 
3
issued to other parties. 
4
(8) Over several decades, CBP has purported to 
5
create an array of exemptions from the prohibitions 
6
of the Jones Act for the benefit of foreign vessels. 
7
(9) On December 11, 2019, CBP published 
8
Customs Bulletin and Decisions, Vol. 53, No. 45 
9
(hereinafter referred to as the ‘‘2019 Decision’’) re-
10
voking a handful of its interpretations, recognizing 
11
that the analyses employed therein were inconsistent 
12
with the Jones Act and original congressional intent, 
13
including by using statutory language ‘‘out of con-
14
text,’’ having been superseded by amendments, or 
15
being predicated on CBP-created distinctions that 
16
had always been ‘‘irrelevant’’ under the Jones Act. 
17
(10) However, the 2019 Decision still left in 
18
force many ruling letters inconsistent with the Jones 
19
Act and original congressional intent, espousing the 
20
same unlawful doctrines, revoked others that prop-
21
erly interpreted the Jones Act, and created several 
22
new loopholes that purport to immunize much of the 
23
same foreign vessel activities that are now, and have 
24
always been, prohibited under the Jones Act. 
25
17:32 Dec 27, 2022
H9548
5 
•HR 9548 IH
(11) Thus, CBP has created invalid exemptions 
1
from the prohibition embodied in the Jones Act, 
2
using a variety of new and old doctrines inconsistent 
3
with original congressional intent. In 2014, the Su-
4
preme Court of the United States found in Utility 
5
Air Regulatory Group. v. Environmental Protection 
6
Agency (573 U.S. 302, 328) that it is a ‘‘core ad-
7
ministrative law principle that an agency may not 
8
rewrite clear statutory terms to suit its own sense of 
9
how the statute should operate’’. 
10
(12) These invalid, ultra vires doctrines, and 
11
their uses, include— 
12
(A) an unlawfully broad interpretation of 
13
‘‘vessel equipment’’ which conflicts with Con-
14
gress’ statutory description of ‘‘merchandise,’’ 
15
and the explicit, limited statutory exemption; 
16
(B) the ‘‘paid out not unladen’’ doctrine, 
17
which provides that pipe or cable laying oper-
18
ations are not coastwise trade subject to the 
19
Jones Act—even when the pipe is laid between 
20
two coastwise points, and in spite of Congress’ 
21
statutory prohibition against foreign vessels 
22
performing ‘‘any part of the transportation by 
23
water’’ of merchandise; 
24
17:32 Dec 27, 2022
H9548
6 
•HR 9548 IH
(C) the ‘‘paid out not unladen’’ doctrine is 
1
also used by foreign vessel operators to justify 
2
the transportation of merchandise attached to 
3
the paid out pipe or cable; 
4
(D) the ‘‘lifting operations’’ exemption, 
5
which purports to permit self-propelled move-
6
ments by a vessel when using a crane or like 
7
equipment to install or remove merchandise on 
8
or from offshore facilities or subsea infrastruc-
9
ture; 
10
(E) the ‘‘decommissioning activity’’ exemp-
11
tion, which purports that merchandise trans-
12
ported as a result of decommissioning—i.e., the 
13
restoration of the sea-floor and the water sur-
14
face by plugging and abandoning the well and 
15
removing the installation and facility—is not 
16
subject to the Jones Act; 
17
(F) 
the 
‘‘offshore 
research 
vessel’’ 
18
misapplications, which improperly extends the 
19
exclusion for oceanographic or limnological re-
20
search vessels to commercial research activities 
21
that directly support the exploration for, or de-
22
velopment, production, transportation, or trans-
23
mission of, resources, on the outer Continental 
24
Shelf; and 
25
17:32 Dec 27, 2022
H9548

•HR 9548 IH
(G) the ‘‘pristine seabed’’ exemption, 
1
where CBP has purported to hold that Outer 
2
Continental Shelf Lands Act’s explicit applica-
3
tion to the ‘‘subsoil and seabed’’ of the outer 
4
Continental Shelf does not include the ‘‘pristine 
5
seabed’’. 
6
(13) If a ruling letter is contrary to the stat-
7
ute’s plain text and the expressed intent of Con-
8
gress, or found unpersuasive by a Federal court, it 
9
will be invalidated as arbitrary and capricious. 
10
(14) Federal courts have not squarely ad-
11
dressed the interpretations contained in these CBP 
12
ruling letters and other guidance, and thus have 
13
never upheld these interpretations as valid and au-
14
thoritative.
