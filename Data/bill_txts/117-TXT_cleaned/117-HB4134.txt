SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
10
Congress finds the following: 
11
(1) Adolescence is a critical period in a girl’s 
12
life, when significant physical, emotional, and social 
13
changes shape her future. 
14
(2) Adolescent girls are particularly vulnerable 
15
to HIV/AIDS, child, early and forced marriage, and 
16
other forms of violence which are detrimental to 
17
their futures, as evidenced by the following statistics: 
18
(A) Each year, 380,000 adolescent girls 
19
and young women become newly infected with 
20
HIV, more than 1,000 every day, and comprise 
21
the fastest-growing demographic for new infec-
22
tions in sub-Saharan Africa. 
23

•HR 4134 IH
(B) Each year, 12,000,000 adolescent girls 
1
around the world are married before their 18th 
2
birthday, and more than 650,000,000 women 
3
alive today were married as children. 
4
(C) Child marriages often interrupt school-
5
ing, limit opportunities, and impact the phys-
6
ical, psychological and social well-being of such 
7
girls. Significant levels of lockdown-related dis-
8
ruption and economic crisis due to the COVID– 
9
19 pandemic could lead to at least four million 
10
more girls married before the age of 18 in the 
11
next two years. 
12
(D) One-quarter to one-half of girls in de-
13
veloping countries become mothers before the 
14
age of 18, and girls under 15 are five times 
15
more likely to die during childbirth than women 
16
in their 20s. As many as one million girls 
17
across sub-Saharan Africa may be blocked from 
18
returning to school due to pregnancy during 
19
COVID–19 school closures. 
20
(3) 
Before 
the 
pandemic, 
approximately 
21
130,000,000 girls around the world were not in 
22
school, and millions more failing to acquire basic 
23
reading, writing, and numeracy skills. With COVID– 
24
19 school closures affecting nearly 91 percent of the 
25
01:47 Jul 23, 2021

•HR 4134 IH
world’s student population, over 743,000,000 girls 
1
have had their education disrupted and will face tre-
2
mendous barriers to returning to school when it is 
3
safe. 
4
(4) Girls between the ages of 10 and 19 are 
5
three times more likely than boys to be kept out of 
6
school, particularly in countries affected by conflict. 
7
(5) Due to discriminatory gender norms and ex-
8
pectations, disparities in access to safe and quality 
9
education manifest early in a girl’s life and continue 
10
to become more pronounced throughout adolescence. 
11
(6) Girls living with disabilities are less likely to 
12
start school and transition to secondary school than 
13
boys living with disabilities and other children, and 
14
just 1 percent of women with disabilities are literate 
15
globally. 
16
(7) While two-thirds of all countries have 
17
achieved gender parity in primary education, only 40 
18
percent have achieved gender parity in secondary 
19
education. 
20
(8) Adolescent girls who remain in school are 
21
more likely to live longer, marry later, and have 
22
healthier children. 
23
(9) Investing in holistic programming that en-
24
sures all girls complete secondary education could 
25

H4134
5 
•HR 4134 IH
lift gross domestic product (GDP) in developing 
1
economies by an average of 10 percent and every $1 
2
spent on such programming would generate a $2.80 
3
return—equivalent to billions of dollars in extra 
4
GDP. 
5
(10) Children born to women who completed 
6
secondary schooling or higher have 17.5-percent re-
7
duced odds of being off track for healthy develop-
8
ment. 
9
(11) Since July 2015, more than 100 public- 
10
private partnerships have been formed between the 
11
United States Government and external partners to 
12
support innovative and community-led solutions in 
13
targeted countries, including Malawi and Tanzania, 
14
to ensure adolescent girls receive a quality edu-
15
cation. 
16
(12) The United States Global Strategy to Em-
17
power Adolescent Girls, published in March 2016, 
18
has brought together the Department of State, the 
19
United States Agency for International Develop-
20
ment, the Peace Corps, and the Millennium Chal-
21
lenge Corporation, as well as other agencies and pro-
22
grams such as the President’s Emergency Fund for 
23
AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), to address the range of 
24
challenges preventing adolescent girls from attaining 
25

•HR 4134 IH
an inclusive and equitable quality education leading 
1
to relevant learning outcomes. 
2
(13) Adopted in 2015, the 2030 Agenda for 
3
Sustainable Development renews the commitment to 
4
creating a world where all girls are healthy and pro-
5
tected, learning and have a fair chance to succeed. 
6
This agenda also states that empowering girls will 
7
require scaling up investments in holistic program-
8
ming models to end gender-based violence, child 
9
marriage and female genital mutilation (FGM) and 
10
adolescent girls’ education and skills are essential to 
11
address gender divides, particularly in secondary 
12
school. 
13
(14) PEPFAR, through its DREAMS (Deter-
14
mined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS-free, Mentored, 
15
and Safe) Initiative, has worked to address a num-
16
ber of the specific barriers to education that adoles-
17
cent girls face. 
18
SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
19
It is the sense of Congress that— 
20
(1) every child, regardless of place of birth, de-
21
serves an equal opportunity to access quality edu-
22
cation; 
23
(2) the United States has been a global leader 
24
in efforts to expand and improve access to quality 
25
01:47 Jul 23, 2021
H4134
7 
•HR 4134 IH
basic education for all, particularly marginalized and 
1
vulnerable populations, including women and girls; 
2
(3) gains with respect to girls’ secondary edu-
3
cation and empowerment have been proven to cor-
4
relate strongly with progress in gender equality and 
5
women’s rights, a stated priority of United States 
6
foreign policy and national security; 
7
(4) achieving gender parity in both access to 
8
and quality of educational opportunity contributes 
9
significantly to economic growth and development, 
10
thereby lowering the risk for violence and instability; 
11
and 
12
(5) education is a lifesaving humanitarian inter-
13
vention that protects the lives, futures, and well- 
14
being of girls.

19
vironments, so that girls can enroll in and regularly 
20
attend school, successfully transition from primary

to secondary school, and eventually graduate having 
22
achieved learning outcomes and positioned to make 
23
healthy transitions into adulthood.
