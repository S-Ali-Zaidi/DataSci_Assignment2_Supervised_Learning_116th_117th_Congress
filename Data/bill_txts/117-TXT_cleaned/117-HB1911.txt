Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.

(a) SHORT TITLE.—This Act may be cited as the

‘‘Child Care is Infrastructure Act’’.

(b) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following find-

ings:

•HR 1911 IH
(1) Early care and learning settings directly im-
1
pact the physical, behavioral, and cognitive develop-
2
ment of young children, and these settings should be 
3
designed and equipped to keep children safe and 
4
help children thrive. 
5
(2) An investigation in 10 States conducted by 
6
the Office of the Inspector General of the Depart-
7
ment of Health and Human Services found that 96 
8
percent of early care and learning facilities inspected 
9
during unannounced visits had at least 1 potentially 
10
hazardous condition. 
11
(3) Approximately 500,000 early care and 
12
learning facilities are not regulated under the Safe 
13
Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300f), and only 11 
14
States and New York City require licensed early 
15
care and learning facilities to test drinking water 
16
within such facilities for lead. 
17
(4) A Department of Health and Human Serv-
18
ices report from 2015 found that an estimated 2,201 
19
Head Start centers needed facility improvements, in-
20
cluding improvements related to rebuilding, ren-
21
ovating, and conducting maintenance on such facili-
22
ties. 
23
(5) Only 2 statewide needs assessments have 
24
been conducted:

•HR 1911 IH
(A) A 2011 statewide study of Massachu-
1
setts early care and learning facilities found ex-
2
cessive levels of carbon dioxide in early care and 
3
learning facilities throughout the State, insuffi-
4
cient ventilation systems, and furnishings con-
5
taining formaldehyde. 
6
(B) A 2014 statewide study in Rhode Is-
7
land found that— 
8
(i) all centers visited had at least one 
9
playground safety hazard; 
10
(ii) centers in poor condition tend to 
11
serve higher rates of low-income, State- 
12
subsidized children; and 
13
(iii) nearly 70 percent of early learn-
14
ing centers visited had one or more issues 
15
related to the overall building condition, 
16
such as water stains, excessive wear, and 
17
peeling paint. 
18
(6) The National Children’s Facilities Network 
19
estimates that the United States would require at 
20
least $14 billion to bring existing early care and 
21
learning facilities up to professional standards. 
22
(7) While data on the condition of facilities is 
23
available for 2 States, it is lacking elsewhere. The 
24
extent of the problem is impossible to determine 
25
21:51 May 11, 2021

•HR 1911 IH
without a nationwide assessment of the current con-
1
dition of existing early care and learning facilities. 
2
(8) In 2019, a member of the child care work-
3
force earned a median pay of $24,230 per year, or 
4
$11.65 per hour, below the Federal poverty rate for 
5
a family of four, which was $26,200 in 2020. 
6
(9) Over half of the child care workforce is en-
7
rolled in at least one main public benefit program— 
8
Medicaid, CHIP, EITC, SNAP, or TANF—com-
9
pared to 21 percent of the United States population. 
10
(10) Poor compensation is associated with lower 
11
job satisfaction and higher turnover rates. In ab-
12
sence of quality wages and benefits, the early child-
13
hood field will continue to struggle to recruit and re-
14
tain its workforce. 
15
(11) Child care workers who have lower edu-
16
cational attainment, work with infants and toddlers, 
17
or come from communities of color earn a lower av-
18
erage wage than their counterparts in the profession. 
19
(12) Child care workers caring for children 
20
from ages 3 to 5 have a slightly higher educational 
21
attainment with 45 percent earning a bachelor’s de-
22
gree compared to just 19 percent of those teaching 
23
younger children. One-third or 34 percent of home- 
24
based providers have no higher education and an ad-
25

•HR 1911 IH
ditional one-third have some college-level education 
1
but did not complete a higher education degree. 
2
(13) Systemic barriers hamper access to higher 
3
education and training for people of color, con-
4
tinuing to affect wages and upward mobility within 
5
any given career field including child care. Efforts to 
6
address barriers to higher education in the early 
7
childhood workforce is critical in increasing diversity 
8
across all roles. 
9
(14) In the early childhood workforce, 94 per-
10
cent of workers are women with more than one in 
11
five being foreign-born, 15 percent being Black, 21 
12
percent being Hispanic. In total, 40 percent of child 
13
care workers are people of color.
