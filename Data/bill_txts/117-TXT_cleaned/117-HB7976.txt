To amend the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention 
Act of 1974 to eliminate the use of valid court orders 
to secure lockup of status offenders, and for other pur-
poses. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Prohibiting Detention 
4
of Youth Status Offenders Act of 2022’’.

•HR 7976 IH
(1) Under the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency 
1
Prevention Act of 1974 (34 U.S.C. 11101 et seq.), 
2
Congress recognized the need to set clear standards 
3
and protect juveniles across the United States by, 
4
among other things, providing that States should 
5
not place youth in secure detention for status of-
6
fenses, which are offenses that would not be criminal 
7
offenses if committed by an adult. 
8
(2) In 1980, Congress amended the Juvenile 
9
Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 (34 
10
U.S.C. 11101 et seq.) to create an exception that 
11
permits judges to place a youth in secure detention 
12
if the youth violates a valid court order (referred to 
13
in this section as ‘‘the VCO exception’’). The VCO 
14
exception has led to thousands of youth being placed 
15
in secure detention for noncriminal status offenses. 
16
(3) Placing a child charged with a noncriminal 
17
status offense in secure confinement with children 
18
who have been accused of serious criminal offenses 
19
can expose the child to negative influences and be-
20
haviors that could contribute to that child returning 
21
into the status offense system or the delinquency 
22
system. 
23
(4) The 5 most common juvenile status offenses 
24
include skipping school, drinking while underage,

running away from home, violating curfew, and act-
1
ing out. 
2
(5) In 2019— 
3
(A) 11 percent of formally processed juve-
4
nile court cases were for a status offense; and 
5
(B) although most petitioned status of-
6
fense cases involved White youth (61 percent), 
7
Black youth and American Indian and Alaska 
8
Native youth were overrepresented among peti-
9
tioned status offenses cases relative to their 
10
population size. 
11
(6) Girls are more often sent to the justice sys-
12
tem for less serious offenses, such as status offenses, 
13
than boys. In 2013, the female share of formally 
14
processed status offense cases (43 percent) was 
15
greater than the share of female delinquency cases 
16
(27 percent). 
17
(7) Girls often engage in status offense behav-
18
iors in response to abuse or trauma and may, for ex-
19
ample, run away to escape abuse at home or in a 
20
foster care placement. 
21
(8) Anyone under the age of majority, which, in 
22
most States, is the age of 18, is subject to status of-
23
fense charges, but teenagers between the ages of 14 
24
and 17 comprise most status offense cases.

(9) Most youth who engage in status and other 
1
minor offenses never progress to more serious behav-
2
ior and will age out of the behavior without court 
3
intervention. 
4
(10) Since 1980, more than half of States have 
5
recognized the dangers of placing youth in secure 
6
detention for noncriminal status offenses and have 
7
stopped using the VCO exception. 
8
(11) While the number of status offenses peti-
9
tioned in courts decreased by 53 percent between 
10
2005 to 2019, during 2019, there were still approxi-
11
mately 4,200 instances of a youth being detained in 
12
response to a status offense. 
13
(12) Congress recognized the need to reform 
14
the VCO exception under the Juvenile Justice Re-
15
form Act of 2018 (115–385; 132 Stat. 5123), which, 
16
among other things, limited the time that a juvenile 
17
could be detained under a VCO exception to not 
18
more than 7 days. 
19
(13) Congress must now act to eliminate the 
20
VCO exception and fully return to the original intent 
21
of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention 
22
Act of 1974 (34 U.S.C. 11101 et seq.), which origi-
23
nally provided that no youth should be held in secure 
24
detention for a noncriminal status offense.
