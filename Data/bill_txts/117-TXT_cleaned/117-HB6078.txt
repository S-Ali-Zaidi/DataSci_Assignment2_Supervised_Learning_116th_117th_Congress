tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 2. PURPOSE; FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
1
(a) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act is to remove 
2
barriers for alien survivors of domestic violence, sexual as-
3
sault, human trafficking, and other crimes who may be 
4
eligible for protections under the Violence Against Women 
5
Act of 1994 (VAWA), the Trafficking Victims Protection 
6
Act of 2000 (TVPA), and their subsequent reauthoriza-
7
tions. 
8
(b) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
9
(1) Threats of deportation are one of the most 
10
potent tools abusers and perpetrators of crime use 
11
to maintain control over and silence alien victims 
12
and to avoid criminal prosecution. Abusers and per-
13
petrators leverage the immigration system in the 
14
abuse and exploitation of aliens they victimize. 
15
(2) A bipartisan majority in Congress created 
16
critical immigration protections in VAWA, TVPA 
17
and their subsequent reauthorizations in recognition 
18
that alien survivors of domestic violence, sexual as-
19
sault, human trafficking, and other eligible crimes 
20
often fear that reaching out for help may lead to 
21
their deportation. 
22
(3) Detention and removal of those with victim- 
23
based cases undermines the intent of VAWA, TVPA, 
24
and their subsequent reuauthorizations and re- 
25
traumatizes victims and their children. Deporting 
26

•HR 6078 IH
survivors while they await decisions on their cases 
1
discourages victims from accessing justice, under-
2
mines the usefulness of these forms of relief as tools 
3
for law enforcement that seek to keep all commu-
4
nities safe, separates them from their children and 
5
support networks, and eliminates the ability of local 
6
law enforcement to continue protecting and working 
7
with such crime survivors. 
8
(4) Lack of timely access to employment au-
9
thorization makes victims more vulnerable and may 
10
lead to their need to endure or return to abusive re-
11
lationships or exploitative conditions. Crime and 
12
abuse survivors should have access to work author-
13
ization to escape abusive situations, and gain self- 
14
sufficiency following victimization so they can sup-
15
port themselves and their families. 
16
(c) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
17
gress that the Secretary of Homeland Security should not 
18
deport crime victims or neglected, abused, or abandoned 
19
youth before their applications for humanitarian relief are 
20
fully adjudicated, as it undermines critical bipartisan pro-
21
tections created in VAWA, TVPA, and their subsequent 
22
reauthorizations.
