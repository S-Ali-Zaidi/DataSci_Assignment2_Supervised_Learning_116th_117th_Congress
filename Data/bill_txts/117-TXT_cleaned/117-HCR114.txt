CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the designation of the week of No-
vember 13 through November 19, 2022, as ‘‘National 
Caregiving Youth Week’’ to raise awareness and encour-
age national recognition of children and adolescents 
under 18 years of age who serve as a primary or sec-
ondary caregiver for family or household members. 
Whereas the term ‘‘caregiving youth’’ refers to children and 
adolescents aged 18 years and under who serve as a pri-
mary or secondary caregiver for family or household 
members who are aging, have a chronic illness, disability, 
frailty, or other health condition for which they require

assistance on a regular basis, including military families 
and veterans; 
Whereas there are an estimated three to five million 
caregiving youth nationwide; 
Whereas there has not been a comprehensive census calcu-
lating this population since 2005, leaving the actual num-
ber of youth in this population today unknown due to 
limited data collection, lack of formal recognition, and 
the hesitance of many families to share information on 
caregiving youth; 
Whereas the need for new national research is urgent in 
order to identify and support this underserved popu-
lation; 
Whereas caregiving youth are distinct because they care spe-
cifically for a loved one who has one or more medical con-
ditions or functional decline requiring care and support 
to undertake everyday activities; 
Whereas caregiving duties range from assisting with personal 
care, such as dressing, bathing, eating, toileting, or as-
sisting with mobility, to managing medical equipment, 
administering medications, caring for a wound, preparing 
meals, translating language in medical settings, and 
more, all of which would typically be the responsibility of 
an adult; 
Whereas many caregiving youth also provide significant ongo-
ing emotional support, particularly when a family mem-
ber is struggling with a terminal or chronic illness; 
Whereas caregiving youth face challenges balancing their 
caregiving responsibilities with their education, mental 
health, and overall well-being because of the inherent 
challenges, demands, and stressors of providing care for

an ill or disabled family member, therefore putting this 
population at greater risk of experiencing anxiety and de-
pression, school dropout, and reduced educational options 
during transitions to adulthood; 
Whereas caregiving youth often do not have access to the re-
sources and services available to adult family caregivers; 
Whereas families of color and low-income families are dis-
proportionately likely to rely on caregiving youth; 
Whereas the number of caregiving youth is increasing due to 
an aging population, more multigeneration households, 
the opioid epidemic, lack of home care insurance and 
services, advances in technology allowing for complex care 
at home including for veterans, more single parent/grand-
parent households, and the COVID–19 pandemic; and 
Whereas when caregiving youth receive recognition and sup-
port, many of the challenges they experience can be miti-
gated, resulting in academic and personal success: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate 
1
concurring), That Congress—
