Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Driving a vehicle is an essential aspect of 
3
the daily lives of most people in the United States. 
4
(2) Driving is often required to access jobs and 
5
healthcare, take care of family, get groceries, and 
6
fulfill other basic responsibilities. 
7
(3) In many small cities, towns, and rural areas 
8
that do not have public transportation and ride-
9
sharing alternatives, driving is often the only real-
10
istic means of transportation. 
11
(4) Even in cities with public transportation 
12
and ridesharing options, individuals vulnerable to in-
13
fection during the COVID–19 pandemic and those 
14
complying with public health guidance regarding so-
15
cial distancing are increasingly reliant on driving as 
16
their primary means of transportation for essential 
17
travel. 
18
(5) In the United States, millions of Americans 
19
have had their driver’s licenses suspended for unpaid 
20
court fines and fees. 
21
(6) A person whose driver’s license is suspended 
22
or revoked for unpaid fines and fees will often find 
23
it more difficult to earn a living and therefore pay 
24
the debt owed to the government.

(7) The barrier to employment posed by driver’s 
1
license suspensions and revocations for unpaid fines 
2
and fees is especially problematic during the 
3
COVID–19 pandemic, when the unemployment rate 
4
is the highest it has been since the Great Depres-
5
sion. 
6
(8) Drunk and dangerous driving are some of 
7
the leading causes of death and serious bodily injury 
8
in the United States, and promoting safety on the 
9
roads is a legitimate, necessary, and core govern-
10
mental function. Suspending a license for unsafe 
11
driving conduct presents different considerations 
12
than suspending a license for unpaid fines and fees. 
13
Suspending a license for unsafe driving is an appro-
14
priate tool to protect public safety. Policymakers 
15
also may consider alternatives to suspension of a li-
16
cense for unsafe driving such as ignition interlock 
17
device programs. 
18
(9) According to the National Highway Traffic 
19
Safety Administration, every year on average, over 
20
34,000 people are killed and 2,400,000 more people 
21
are injured in motor vehicle crashes. Some of the 
22
major causes of these crashes include speeding, im-
23
paired driving, and distracted driving. Nearly half of 
24
passenger vehicle occupants killed in crashes are un-
25

•HR 2453 IH
restrained. The societal harm caused by motor vehi-
1
cle crashes has been valued at $836 billion annually. 
2
The enactment of, enforcement of, and education re-
3
garding traffic laws are key to addressing unsafe be-
4
havior and promoting public safety. 
5
(10) However, most driver’s license suspensions 
6
are not based on the need to protect public safety. 
7
(11) In the State of Florida, 1,100,000 resi-
8
dents received a suspension notice for unpaid fines 
9
and fees in 2017 alone. 
10
(12) Between 2010 and 2017, all but 3 States 
11
increased the amount of fines and fees for civil and 
12
criminal violations. 
13
(13) In the United States, 40 percent of all 
14
driver’s license suspensions are issued for conduct 
15
that was unrelated to driving. 
16
(14) In 2015, the State of Washington cal-
17
culated that State troopers spent 70,848 hours deal-
18
ing with license suspensions for non-driving offenses. 
19
(15) The American Association of Motor Vehi-
20
cle Administrators estimated that arresting a person 
21
for driving with a suspended license can take 9 
22
hours of an officer’s time, including waiting for a 
23
tow truck, transporting an individual to jail, filling 
24
out paperwork, making a court appearance, and 
25

•HR 2453 IH
other administrative duties and accordingly Wash-
1
ington State Patrol Chief John Batiste called non- 
2
driving suspensions a ‘‘drain on the system as a 
3
whole’’. 
4
(16) The Colorado Department of Motor Vehi-
5
cles determined that suspending driver’s licenses for 
6
offenses unrelated to driving consumed 8,566 hours 
7
per year of staff time in the Department. 
8
(17) Many States impose a significant fee for 
9
reinstating a suspended driver’s license, such as Ala-
10
bama, where the fee is $275. 
11
(18) Driving on a suspended license is one of 
12
the most common criminal charges in jurisdictions 
13
across the country. 
14
(19) Seventy-five percent of those with sus-
15
pended licenses report continuing to drive. 
16
(20) It is more likely that those people are also 
17
driving without insurance due to the costs and re-
18
strictions associated with obtaining auto insurance 
19
on a suspended license, thereby placing a greater fi-
20
nancial burden on other drivers when a driver with 
21
a suspended license causes an accident. 
22
(21) The American Association of Motor Vehi-
23
cle Administrators has concluded the following: 
24
‘‘Drivers who have been suspended for social non- 
25
21:33 Apr 16, 2021
H2453

•HR 2453 IH
conformance-related offenses are often trapped with-
1
in the system. Some cannot afford to pay the origi-
2
nal fines, and may lose their ability to legally get to 
3
and from work as a result of the suspension. Many 
4
make the decision to drive while suspended. The sus-
5
pension results in increased financial obligations 
6
through new requirements such as reinstatement 
7
fees, court costs, and other penalties. While there is 
8
a clear societal interest in keeping those who are 
9
unfit to drive off the roads, broadly restricting li-
10
censes for violations unrelated to an individual’s 
11
ability to drive safely may do more harm than good. 
12
This is especially true in areas of the country that 
13
lack alternative means of transportation. For those 
14
individuals, a valid driver license can be a means to 
15
survive. Local communities, employers, and employ-
16
ees all experience negative consequences as a result 
17
of social non-conformity suspensions, including un-
18
employment, lower wages, fewer employment oppor-
19
tunities and hiring choices, and increased insurance 
20
costs.’’. 
21
(22) A report by the Harvard Law School 
22
Criminal Justice Policy Program concluded the fol-
23
lowing: ‘‘The suspension of a driver’s or professional 
24
license is one of the most pervasive poverty traps for 
25
21:33 Apr 16, 2021
H2453
7 
•HR 2453 IH
poor people assessed a fine that they cannot afford 
1
to pay. The practice is widespread. Nearly 40 per-
2
cent of license suspensions nationwide stem from un-
3
paid fines, missed child support payments, and drug 
4
offenses—not from unsafe or intoxicated driving or 
5
failing to obtain automotive insurance. Suspension of 
6
a driver’s or professional licenses is hugely counter-
7
productive; it punishes non-payment by taking away 
8
a person’s means for making a living. License sus-
9
pension programs are also expensive for States to 
10
run and they distract law enforcement efforts from 
11
priorities related to public safety. License suspen-
12
sions may also be unconstitutional if the license was 
13
suspended before the judge determined the defend-
14
ant had the ability to pay the criminal justice debt.’’.
