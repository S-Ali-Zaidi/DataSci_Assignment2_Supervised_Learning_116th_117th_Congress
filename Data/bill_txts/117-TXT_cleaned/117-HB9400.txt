and for other purposes.

(2) formulate recommendations on integrating 
1
such tools into the Federal legislative process to 
2
achieve better population health outcomes; 
3
(3) formulate recommendations on how behav-
4
ioral and nudge research on the effects of health dis-
5
parities may translate into evaluative tools for pol-
6
icymakers; and 
7
(4) consider, with input from the Comptroller
