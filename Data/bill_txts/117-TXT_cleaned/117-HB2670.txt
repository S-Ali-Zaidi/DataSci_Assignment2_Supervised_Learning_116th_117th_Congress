A BILL 
To amend the National and Community Service Act of 1990 
to establish a Civilian Climate Corps to help communities 
respond to climate change and transition to a clean econ-
omy, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘The Civilian Climate 
2
Corps for Jobs and Justice Act’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) The effects of climate change include ex-
6
treme heat, drought, intensified storms and hurri-
7
canes, rising sea level, ocean acidification, inten-
8
sifying wildfires, and other natural disasters. 
9
(2) These natural disasters exert profound im-
10
pacts on the lives and livelihoods of all individuals, 
11
but some communities, particularly low-income com-
12
munities and communities of color, are dispropor-
13
tionately exposed and vulnerable to climate impacts 
14
and pollution. 
15
(3) To stem the worst effects of climate change, 
16
the global economy must completely decarbonize and 
17
remain carbon negative thereafter, which requires a 
18
domestic economy-wide transition to a clean and 
19
sustainable economy within a rapid timeframe. 
20
(4) Such a transition requires a massive labor 
21
mobilization and the development of a diverse, inclu-
22
sive, and skilled workforce. Historically underserved 
23
communities must equitably receive the resources 
24
they need to effectively mitigate and adapt to cli-
25

mate change, and displaced or unemployed workers 
1
require retraining and support. 
2
(5) Millions of people face unemployment and 
3
barriers to opportunity, especially in low-income 
4
rural, urban, and tribal environments. These chal-
5
lenges have been exacerbated by the COVID–19 cri-
6
sis, which also disproportionately affected low-in-
7
come people and young people of color, who cur-
8
rently face unemployment at rates double the na-
9
tional average. 
10
(6) An existing network of national, State, trib-
11
al, and local service and conservation corps can be 
12
rapidly scaled and supplemented to mobilize labor, 
13
provide job opportunities and career training, and 
14
help establish the workforce necessary to accomplish 
15
the transition to a clean and just economy. 
16
(7) Corps positions provide hands-on work ex-
17
perience, income, and job training for unemployed 
18
individuals in the United States, as well as leader-
19
ship skills, an opportunity for community service, 
20
and an understanding of environmental stewardship. 
21
(8) The Corporation for National and Commu-
22
nity Service has the ability to recruit, select, fund, 
23
and oversee 1,500,000 members of service corps by

•HR 2670 IH
2025 to complete important projects across the en-
1
tire country to help address the climate crisis. 
2
(9) Unsatisfactory wages and working condi-
3
tions, and employers’ refusal to respect workers’ 
4
rights to organize and collectively bargain, lead to 
5
labor disputes, which threaten to frustrate or delay 
6
the urgent mobilization necessary to address climate 
7
change. Such disputes are prevented or minimized 
8
when the law effectively protects the right of workers 
9
to receive fair compensation and benefits, to form or 
10
join unions, to collectively bargain over the terms 
11
and conditions of employment, and to engage in 
12
other concerted activities for mutual aid or protec-
13
tion.
