SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.

(a) SHORT TITLE.—This Act may be cited as the 
4
‘‘Save America’s Rural Hospitals Act’’.

(b) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:

•HR 6400 IH
(1) More than 60,000,000 individuals in rural 
1
areas of the United States rely on rural hospitals 
2
and other providers as critical access points to 
3
health care. 
4
(2) Access to health care is essential to commu-
5
nities that Americans living in rural areas call home. 
6
(3) Americans living in rural areas are older, 
7
poorer, and sicker than Americans living in urban 
8
areas. 
9
(4) Between January 2010 and January 1, 
10
2021, 137 rural hospitals closed in the United 
11
States, according to the University of North Caro-
12
lina’s Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Re-
13
search, and the rate of these closures is increasing. 
14
(5) Four hundred and fifty-three hospitals are 
15
operating at margins similar to those that have 
16
closed over the past decade. Of those, 216 are con-
17
sidered most vulnerable to closure. 
18
(6) Rural Medicare beneficiaries already face a 
19
number of challenges when trying to access health 
20
care services close to home, including the weather, 
21
geography, and cultural, social, and language bar-
22
riers.

•HR 6400 IH
(7) Approximately sixty percent of all primary 
1
care health professional shortage areas are located 
2
in rural areas. 
3
(8) Seniors living in rural areas are forced to 
4
travel significant distances for care. 
5
(9) On average, trauma victims in rural areas 
6
must travel twice as far as victims in urban areas 
7
to the closest hospital, and, as a result, 60 percent 
8
of trauma deaths occur in rural areas, even though 
9
only 20 percent of Americans live in rural areas. 
10
(10) With the 453 hospitals on the brink of clo-
11
sure, millions of Americans living in rural areas are 
12
on the brink of losing access to the closest emer-
13
gency room.
