RESOLUTION 
Expressing the House of Representatives’ support for 
COVID–19 vaccinations and affirming their safety and 
efficacy. 
Whereas COVID–19 is a deadly and highly contagious dis-
ease; 
Whereas, as of May 20, 2021, the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention has reported over 32,000,000 re-
corded COVID–19 cases in the United States, over 
584,000 domestic deaths, over 164,000,000 international 
cases, and over 3,000,000 global deaths;

Whereas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention and leading public health officials, the most 
effective way to slow the spread of SARS–CoV–2, reduce 
cases and hospitalizations, and save lives is through the 
widespread use of COVID–19 vaccinations; 
Whereas COVID–19 vaccines have been proven safe and ef-
fective in significantly reducing infection, serious illness, 
and death; 
Whereas data demonstrate that COVID–19 inoculation dras-
tically reduces an individual’s susceptibility to contracting 
COVID–19; 
Whereas fully vaccinated individuals are less likely to spread 
the SARS–CoV–2, therefore, vaccinations protect not 
only vaccinated individuals, but also individuals in and 
around their communities, particularly people at in-
creased risk for severe illness from COVID–19; 
Whereas individuals with certain medical conditions that pro-
hibit them from getting vaccinated may also be especially 
susceptible to COVID–19, making it even more important 
that those around them get vaccinated; 
Whereas, as of May 20, 2021, over 159,000,000 people in the 
United States have received COVID–19 vaccines, 60 per-
cent of the total adult population; 
Whereas COVID–19 vaccines have undergone the most inten-
sive safety monitoring in United States history, including 
established and new safety monitoring systems created by 
the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention; 
Whereas COVID–19 vaccines were evaluated in tens of thou-
sands of diverse participants in clinical trials and met the 
Food and Drug Administration’s rigorous scientific

standards for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing 
quality needed to support emergency use authorization 
under section 564 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cos-
metic Act (21 U.S.C. 360bbb-3); 
Whereas many countries have already experienced a decline 
in COVID–19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths as a di-
rect result of mass vaccination efforts; 
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has 
issued guidance that fully vaccinated individuals are no 
longer required to wear masks or social distance in most 
settings; 
Whereas in addition to saving lives, mass vaccinations will en-
able the United States to safely reopen businesses and 
schools, thereby saving jobs and helping students resume 
in-person learning; 
Whereas vaccinations are especially essential in industries 
that require close contact, such as health care settings, 
schools and daycares, service industries, and congregate 
living facilities; 
Whereas vaccinating educators and school support staff will 
help keep staff and students safe, many of whom are not 
yet age-eligible to be vaccinated themselves; 
Whereas vaccines are free for all residents of the United 
States, readily available, and easily accessible; 
Whereas 90 percent of all individuals in the United States 
live within 5 miles of a vaccination site; 
Whereas there is no data or evidence that vaccines can give 
an individual COVID–19, cause infertility, include 
microchips, alter DNA, or contain fetal tissue; and
