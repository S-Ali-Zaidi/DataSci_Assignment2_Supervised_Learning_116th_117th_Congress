Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. FINDINGS. 
3
The Congress finds the following: 
4
(1) In 1960, the Supreme Court ruled in Boyn-
5
ton v. Virginia that segregated bus and rail stations 
6
were unconstitutional. 
7
(2) The rigid system of racial segregation that 
8
prevailed in the United States during the 1960s did 
9
not permit a Black person to sit next to a White 
10
person on any bus traveling through interstate com-
11
merce and in most locations in the South. Bus sta-
12
tions had ‘‘Whites Only’’ waiting areas and Blacks 
13
were not permitted to wait in those areas despite the 
14
Supreme Court making it the law of the land. 
15
(3) The Freedom Riders, with the intent to end 
16
segregation in public transportation throughout the 
17
South, paved the way for full racial integration of 
18
the United States transit system. They overcame 
19
prejudice, discrimination, and violence. They sparked 
20
a movement that changed our Nation. 
21
(4) The Congress of Racial Equality (C.O.R.E.) 
22
selected thirteen volunteers for nonviolent response 
23
training to join in the Freedom Rides from Wash-
24
ington, DC, to New Orleans, LA. The Freedom Rid-

ers used their strategies of nonviolence throughout 
1
the South to challenge the region’s Jim Crow laws 
2
directly and enforce the Supreme Court decision in 
3
Boynton. 
4
(5) On the morning of May 4, 1961, the Free-
5
dom Riders, comprised of seven Blacks and six 
6
Whites, boarded two buses, with Blacks and Whites 
7
seated together. Those thirteen Freedom Riders 
8
were: Genevieve Hughes Houghton, Charles Person, 
9
Hank Thomas, John Lewis, Edward Blankenheim, 
10
James Farmer, Walter Bergman, Frances Bergman, 
11
Joseph Perkins, Jimmy McDonald, Mae Francis 
12
Moultrie, Benjamin Elton Cox, and Albert Bigelow. 
13
Most segregated States considered even this level of 
14
integration a crime. At various stops along the way, 
15
the Freedom Riders would enter areas designated 
16
‘‘Whites’’ and ‘‘Colored’’ and would eat together at 
17
segregated lunch counters to defy local laws. 
18
(6) Initially, the Freedom Riders had encoun-
19
tered only minor clashes until a stop in South Caro-
20
lina. In Rock Hill, an angry mob severely beat John 
21
Lewis, late Congressman from the 5th District of 
22
Georgia, when he entered the bus station. Henry 
23
‘‘Hank’’ Thomas was jailed when he entered the bus 
24
station in Winnsboro. Authorities delivered him to a 
25

waiting mob long after the station had closed that 
1
evening. A local Black minister rescued Thomas, en-
2
abling him to rejoin the group in Columbia. How-
3
ever, Lewis was so badly beaten he could not con-
4
tinue the Freedom Rides. 
5
(7) Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and other civil 
6
rights leaders met with the group in Atlanta to dis-
7
suade their continuance through the Deep South due 
8
to death threats. Despite these warnings, more Free-
9
dom Riders joined in Atlanta. Dedicated to their 
10
mission to end segregation in the South and trained 
11
in nonviolent movements, the Freedom Riders con-
12
tinued on their journey. 
13
(8) On Mother’s Day, May 14, 1961, the Free-
14
dom Riders were on two different buses. An angry 
15
mob in Anniston, Alabama, firebombed the first bus. 
16
When the Freedom Riders rushed out, still choking 
17
from the thick smoke of the burning bus, the wait-
18
ing angry mob beat them with lead pipes and base-
19
ball bats as the bus exploded. Ambulances refused to 
20
transport the Black Freedom Riders to the hospital. 
21
The mob beat the Freedom Riders on the second bus 
22
and forced them to sit in the back. As they jour-
23
neyed to Birmingham, another mob savagely beat 
24
the Freedom Riders.

(9) The Nashville (TN) Student Group, a local 
1
group of students who had been successful in deseg-
2
regating the lunch counters and movie theaters in 
3
Nashville (TN), vowed not to let these acts of vio-
4
lence curtail the goal of the Freedom Rides. They 
5
sent their members to continue the Freedom Rides 
6
and called out to other student groups to do the 
7
same. 
8
(10) As the violence grew, the Attorney General 
9
of the United States called in the National Guard 
10
and the U.S. Marshals to protect the Freedom Rid-
11
ers as they journeyed through Alabama. This protec-
12
tion was short-lived. The Federal authorities turned 
13
the Freedom Riders over to the local authorities in 
14
Mississippi who then arrested the Freedom Riders 
15
for disturbing the peace. 
16
(11) The government of Mississippi imprisoned 
17
many of the Freedom Riders in Parchman Prison 
18
known for its horrific conditions, such as subjecting 
19
the Freedom Riders to strip searches, work on chain 
20
gangs, and light shining in their cells 24 hours a 
21
day. Despite these conditions, the Freedom Riders 
22
refused bail because they were determined to spread 
23
the message of their nonviolent movement.

(12) Five months after the first Freedom Rid-
1
ers left on their historic ride, the Interstate Com-
2
merce Commission in conjunction with the U.S. At-
3
torney General Robert Kennedy issued a Federal 
4
order banning segregation at all interstate public fa-
5
cilities based upon ‘‘race, color or creed’’. The law 
6
became effective on November 1, 1961. 
7
(13) In 2011, Barack Obama, the President of 
8
the United States paid tribute to the Freedom Rid-
9
ers with a Presidential proclamation honoring the 
10
50th anniversary of the first Freedom Ride by brave 
11
Americans whose selfless act of courage helped pave 
12
the way for others to continue on the road to Civil 
13
Rights in America.
