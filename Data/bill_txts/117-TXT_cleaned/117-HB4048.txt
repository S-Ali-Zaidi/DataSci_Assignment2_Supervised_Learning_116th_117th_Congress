and properly managed to exclude individuals with 
1
conflicts of interest and under which the following 
2
takes place: 
3
(A) Relevant research laboratories and 
4
hospitals open their records to examination by 
5
the investigative team and grant the investiga-
6
tive team unfettered access to any and all facili-
7
ties and other sites of interest, and to any and 
8
all forms of epidemiological or virological data 
9
of interest, including serological records per-
10
taining to the earliest confirmed or suspected 
11
cases of COVID–19, or cases of similar illnesses 
12
that may have been misdiagnosed, which ap-
13
peared in and around Wuhan in the fall and 
14
winter of 2019. Investigators document the ve-
15
racity and source of the data upon which their 
16
analysis is based in a manner that allows inde-
17
pendent experts to reproduce their analysis and 
18
validate any conclusions they may draw. 
19
(B) The international team is allowed to 
20
perform a full forensic investigation of the 
21
Wuhan Institute of Virology, and if necessary, 
22
the Wuhan Center for Disease Prevention and 
23
Control and the Wuhan Institute of Biological 
24
Products, and all other laboratories in Wuhan

that the team might identify as warranting ex-
1
amination. The team is allowed to review the 
2
biosafety level under which bat coronavirus re-
3
search was conducted, and to interview any and 
4
all personnel currently or previously employed 
5
at those laboratories, or related experts who 
6
may have information pertinent to the inves-
7
tigation. All laboratory logs and notebooks kept 
8
by Shi Zhengli and other researchers at the 
9
Wuhan Institute of Virology who have con-
10
ducted gain-of-function experiments between 
11
2007 and the date of the enactment of this Act, 
12
as well as their published and unpublished work 
13
in Chinese and English, are presented in a full 
14
and unaltered condition for examination by the 
15
team. The team is given unlimited access to the 
16
full range of virus cultures, isolates, genetic se-
17
quences, databases, and patient specimens 
18
stored at these facilities as well as all chimeric 
19
synthetic viruses grown in vitro by cell culture 
20
passaging or engineered by genomic editing be-
21
tween 2007 and the date of the enactment of 
22
this Act. Such access must include the oppor-
23
tunity to examine the Wuhan Institute of 
24
Virology’s database of approximately 22,000

samples and virus sequences, including 15,000 
1
taken from bats, which was previously available 
2
to the public but taken offline in September 
3
2019. The team is further allowed to examine 
4
in full all training procedures in effect at the 
5
laboratory prior to the pandemic, including 
6
those pertaining to recordkeeping and safety 
7
procedures and strategies to prevent the acci-
8
dental escape of potential pathogens. 
9
(C) The investigative team analyzes in de-
10
tail all research related to the 293 bat coronavi-
11
ruses reportedly isolated by Shi Zhengli and her 
12
team at the Wuhan Institute of Virology be-
13
tween 2012 and 2015, particularly RaTG13 
14
and RaBtCoV/4991, including all virus isolates 
15
and cultures. The Wuhan Institute of Virology 
16
discloses the content of all classified and unpub-
17
lished studies that the Institute reportedly con-
18
ducted with the People’s Liberation Army if 
19
such studies involved gain-of-function research. 
20
The team is able to test all laboratory personnel 
21
for antibodies and other serological indicators 
22
of past infection of COVID–19. The team is 
23
given access to all other records kept by the 
24
Wuhan Institute of Virology, including security

logs, surveillance video footage, audio record-
1
ings, and electronic logs of employees entering 
2
and leaving the facility. The investigative team 
3
is permitted to take samples and conduct test-
4
ing of the physical facilities where gain-of-func-
5
tion research has been conducted, including, if 
6
necessary, sewer samples. Unfettered access is 
7
also granted to the abandoned copper mine in 
8
Mojiang Hani Autonomous County in Yunnan 
9
province, where Wuhan Institute of Virology re-
10
searchers are known to have collected bat virus 
11
specimens, including of RaTG13, during the 
12
decade preceding the date of the enactment of 
13
this Act. 
14
(D) The international team is comprised of 
15
members chosen by the governments of the 
16
United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, 
17
France, the Netherlands, Germany, Australia, 
18
Japan, and India. The team includes molecular 
19
biologists, virologists, epidemiologists, and ex-
20
perts in biosafety and biosecurity. Individuals 
21
who have previously ruled out the possibility of 
22
either zoonotic transmission or a laboratory 
23
leak are disqualified from participation. The 
24
Government of the People’s Republic of China 
25
01:41 Jul 10, 2021
H4048
13 
•HR 4048 IH
may appoint Chinese experts to accompany and 
1
advise the team as it conducts its work in the 
2
People’s Republic of China, but the Government 
3
of the People’s Republic of China has no au-
4
thority to dictate the selection of team members 
5
and cannot obstruct the participation of any in-
6
dividual selected by the individual’s government 
7
for the team. The central, provincial, and mu-
8
nicipal authorities of the People’s Republic of 
9
China facilitate the work of the investigative 
10
team and refrain from imposing any restrictions 
11
on the scope, scale, and duration of the inves-
12
tigation.

17
nent residence to the United States;
