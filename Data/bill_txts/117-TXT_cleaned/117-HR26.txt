United States of America, in maintenance and support of

its impeachment against him for high crimes and mis-

demeanors.

ARTICLE I 
6
The Constitution provides that the House of Rep-
7
resentatives ‘‘shall have the sole Power of Impeachment’’ 
8
and that the President ‘‘shall be removed from Office on 
9
Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or 
10
other high Crimes and Misdemeanors’’. In his conduct of 
11
the office of President of the United States—and in viola-
12
tion of his constitutional oath faithfully to execute the of-
13
fice of President of the United States and, to the best of 
14
his ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution 
15
of the United States, and in violation of his constitutional 
16
duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed— 
17
Donald John Trump has abused the powers of the Presi-
18
dency, in that: 
19
Using the powers of his high office, on Saturday, 
20
January 2, 2021, just four days before the Joint Meeting 
21
of Congress required by the Constitution for the purpose 
22
of opening and counting the electoral votes cast for the 
23
office of President and Vice-President, Donald John 
24
Trump sought to threaten, intimidate, and corruptly so-
25
licit the Secretary of State for the State of Georgia to ac-

quiesce to his demand that he somehow ‘‘find 11,780 
1
votes’’, which he claimed he was entitled to and would re-
2
sult in a determination that he was the winner of the Pres-
3
idential election in the State of Georgia, notwithstanding 
4
the fact that votes in the State of Georgia had already 
5
been thrice counted in favor of the certified winner, his 
6
opponent and former Vice-President Joseph R. Biden. 
7
In this, the President of the United States abused 
8
the powers of the Presidency by actively undermining pub-
9
lic faith and confidence in the integrity of the American 
10
electoral system, subverting the rule of law, and placing 
11
his personal political and private interests above the na-
12
tional interest. 
13
Wherefore Donald John Trump, by such conduct, has 
14
demonstrated that he will remain a threat to security of 
15
the Nation and the Constitution if allowed to remain in 
16
office, and has acted in a manner grossly incompatible 
17
with self-governance and the rule of law and thus warrants 
18
impeachment and trial, removal from office, and disquali-
19
fication to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, trust, or 
20
profit under the United States.

Donald John Trump has abused the powers of the Presi-

dency, in that: 
9
Abusing the powers and resources of his high office, 
10
Donald John Trump has actively and continuously endeav-
11
ored to undermine the essential institutions and founda-
12
tions of a democratic system of government in the United 
13
States, engaging in a long train of abuses and 
14
usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object, evincing 
15
a design to make himself an authoritarian ruler unac-
16
countable to, and independent of, the people of the United 
17
States by: 
18
(1) Soliciting and welcoming the assistance of a 
19
hostile foreign power to aid him in securing election 
20
in 2016 as President of the United States. 
21
(2) Refusing to acknowledge Russian inter-
22
ference in the internal affairs of the United States, 
23
and then opposing responses by Congress and the 
24
Executive Branch to protect the national security

and interests of the United States against future

2
(3) Publicly conveying his interest and willing-
3
ness to accept the assistance of foreign powers in his 
4
attempt to win reelection as President of the United 
5
States. 
6
(4) Refusing continuously to acknowledge to the 
7
American people that he would accept and be bound 
8
by the verdict rendered in the 2020 Presidential 
9
election, instead claiming that any outcome in which 
10
he was not declared the winner was fraudulent, 
11
rigged, and illegitimate. 
12
(5) Taking active measures to impede and un-
13
dermine the ability of American citizens to convey 
14
their disapproval of his continuance in office by ex-
15
ercising their rights as voters, including misusing 
16
the United States Postal Service to prevent the 
17
timely delivery of mail-in ballots. 
18
(6) Instituting frivolous lawsuits to overturn the 
19
results of the 2020 Presidential election, falsely al-
20
leging wide-spread voting fraud but producing no 
21
evidence in support of his spurious allegations. 
22
(7) Exhorting and inciting his supporters to be-
23
lieve falsely that victory in the 2020 Presidential 
24
election had been stolen from him and that constitu-

purpose of counting the votes of electors and an-
2
nouncement of the result by the President of the

Senate was illegitimate and intended to complete the 
4
theft of his victory.

(8) Failing to take action to protect and defend 
6
Federal officers and personnel, property, buildings, 
7
and institutions on January 6, 2021, at the U.S. 
8
Capitol that was besieged by supporters of Donald 
9
John Trump, resulting in extensive damage to the 
10
property of the United States and the deaths of at 
11
least four persons. 
12
In all of this, President Trump has acted in a manner 
13
contrary to his trust as President and subversive of con-
14
stitutional government, to the great prejudice of the cause 
15
of law and justice, and to the manifest injury of the people 
16
of the United States. As the Framers wrote in 1776 in 
17
the Declaration of Independence, a person, ‘‘whose char-
18
acter is thus marked by every act which may define a ty-
19
rant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people’’. 
20
Wherefore Donald John Trump, by such conduct, has 
21
demonstrated that he will remain a threat to security of 
22
the Nation and the Constitution if allowed to remain in 
23
office, and has acted in a manner grossly incompatible
