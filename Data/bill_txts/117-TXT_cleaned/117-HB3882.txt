SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
10
Congress finds the following: 
11
(1) In the early weeks of the spread of the virus 
12
responsible for COVID–19, the Government of 
13
06:34 Jul 14, 2021
H3882

•HR 3882 IH
China systematically suppressed, misrepresented, 
1
and falsified information concerning such spread. 
2
(2) The first reported instance of such virus 
3
may have occurred on November 17, 2019, in 
4
Wuhan, China. The Government of China did not 
5
notify the World Health Organization that it had de-
6
tected an unknown respiratory illness until Decem-
7
ber 31, 2019. 
8
(3) The Government of China violated inter-
9
national law by covering up the origins and spread 
10
of such virus. 
11
(4) Articles 6 and 7 of the International Health 
12
Regulations of 2005 require notification to the 
13
World Health Organization within 24 hours of an 
14
assessment of events that may constitute a public 
15
health emergency of international concern. 
16
(5) The International Health Regulations re-
17
quire the World Health Organization to be notified 
18
of ‘‘all relevant public health information’’ regarding 
19
public health events of international concern, and for 
20
information to be shared in a ‘‘timely, accurate, and 
21
sufficiently detailed manner’’. 
22
(6) The Government of China failed to share 
23
information with the World Health Organization, 
24
and embarked on a campaign to silence doctors, sci-

entists, and whistleblowers in an attempt to mislead 
1
the Chinese people and the international community 
2
concerning the spread of such virus. 
3
(7) On December 27, 2019, samples of the 
4
virus found in hospitals in Wuhan, China, were ana-
5
lyzed and determined to be a novel coronavirus. 
6
(8) The Government of China did not share 
7
with the World Health Organization such determina-
8
tion concerning the novel coronavirus. 
9
(9) On January 3, 2020, the Government of 
10
China ordered Chinese scientists working to se-
11
quence the genome of such virus to surrender or de-
12
stroy their samples and the Government of China 
13
did not publicly share the genetic sequence until 
14
January 12, 2020. 
15
(10) In early January, the Government of 
16
China jailed eight medical professionals who sought 
17
to share information relating to such virus. 
18
(11) A Chinese ophthalmologist, Doctor Li 
19
Wenliang, tried to warn the medical community of 
20
such virus. The Government of China forced Doctor 
21
Li to sign a letter stating that he made ‘‘false state-
22
ments’’ concerning such virus. Doctor Li later be-
23
came infected with such virus and died on February 
24
7, 2020. 
25
06:34 Jul 14, 2021

•HR 3882 IH
(12) The Government of China insisted that no 
1
evidence existed concerning the spread of such virus 
2
through person-to-person transmission, and allowed 
3
Chinese citizens to travel unimpeded, including dur-
4
ing the Lunar New Year, when travelers numbered 
5
in the hundreds of millions. 
6
(13) On December 31, 2019, the Government 
7
of Taiwan noted the possibility that such virus could 
8
spread through person-to-person transmission. Offi-
9
cials of the World Health Organization sent to 
10
China did not announce that such virus could spread 
11
through person-to-person transmission until January 
12
22, 2020. 
13
(14) The Government of China continues to 
14
neutralize or eliminate actors who threaten to expose 
15
the Government of China’s culpability in the spread 
16
of such virus. 
17
(15) Wuhan Central Hospital reprimanded Doc-
18
tor Ai Fen for sharing a picture of a patient report 
19
labeled ‘‘SARS Coronavirus’’. In an interview pub-
20
lished in the Chinese magazine Ren Wu on March 
21
10, 2020, Doctor Ai said, ‘‘This incident has shown 
22
that everyone needs to have their own thoughts be-
23
cause someone has to step up to speak the truth.’’. 
24
06:34 Jul 14, 2021

•HR 3882 IH
(16) The repeated violations of the Inter-
1
national Health Regulations by the Government of 
2
China caused the spread of such virus first in 
3
Wuhan, China, and then worldwide. 
4
(17) As of June 8, 2021, such spread resulted 
5
in 173,331,478 confirmed cases and 3,735,571 
6
deaths. 
7
(18) As of June 8, 2021, 33,193,680 Ameri-
8
cans had been infected by such virus and 594,802 
9
of those people died. 
10
(19) In an October 12, 2020, issue of the Jour-
11
nal of the American Medical Association, economists 
12
Lawrence Summers and David Cutler calculated 
13
that such spread would cost the United States at 
14
least $16 trillion. 
15
(20) On October 13, 2020, the International 
16
Monetary Fund estimated that such spread will cost 
17
the global economy approximately $28 trillion in lost 
18
economic output. 
19
(21) The World Bank estimated on December 
20
14, 2020, that such spread added between 88 million 
21
people and 115 million people to those living in ex-
22
treme poverty and caused between 83 million people 
23
and 132 million people to become undernourished.

(22) The World Bank further predicted that 
1
learning losses and higher dropout rates caused by 
2
such spread would cost students an estimated $10 
3
trillion in future earnings, nearly 10 percent of glob-
4
al Gross Domestic Product. 
5
(23) The International Labor Organization esti-
6
mated that the spread of such virus caused an 8.8 
7
percent drop in working hours globally, which is 
8
equivalent to 255 million full-time jobs. 
9
(24) More than 60 million Americans filed un-
10
employment claims between March and October 
11
2020. 
12
(25) The United States unemployment rate 
13
reached 14.8 percent in April 2020, the highest rate 
14
observed since 1948. 
15
(26) The Congressional Budget Office predicted 
16
$7.6 trillion in United States economic output would 
17
be lost to the pandemic between 2021 and 2031. 
18
(27) To mitigate the economic impact of such 
19
spread and bolster response efforts, Congress appro-
20
priated nearly $5.3 trillion in emergency spending. 
21
(28) The Congressional Budget Office more 
22
than tripled its Fiscal Year 2020 Federal budget 
23
deficit projection from $1 trillion in January 2020 
24
to $3.3 trillion.

(29) If China had acted in accordance with its 
1
international obligations just three weeks earlier, the

number of early coronavirus cases may have been 95

SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
5
It is the sense of Congress that— 
6
(1) in February 2020, the United States cor-
7
rectly designated Chinese state-owned media outlets 
8
as foreign missions; 
9
(2) the Secretary of State should limit to 100 
10
or fewer people the total number of Chinese citizens 
11
who may work for a Chinese state-owned media out-
12
let in the United States; 
13
(3) such limitation may encourage China to 
14
allow American journalists and other foreign inde-
15
pendent reporters to live and report in China with-
16
out threat or harassment by China; and 
17
(4) United States entities should avoid sup-
18
porting or spreading propaganda from China by re-
19
viewing the policies of such entities relating to media 
20
advertisements created by China or advertising in 
21
media outlets owned or operated by China. 
22
SEC. 5. STATEMENT OF POLICY.
