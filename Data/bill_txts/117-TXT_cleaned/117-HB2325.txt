SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds that— 
2
(1) all 8 extant species of bear—Asian black 
3
bear, brown bear, polar bear, American black bear, 
4
spectacled bear, giant panda, sun bear, and sloth 
5
bear—are listed on appendix I or II of the Conven-
6
tion on International Trade in Endangered Species 
7
of Wild Fauna and Flora (27 UST 1087; TIAS 
8
8249) (referred to in this section as ‘‘CITES’’); 
9
(2) Article XIV of CITES provides that Parties 
10
to CITES may adopt stricter domestic measures re-
11
garding the conditions for trade, taking, possession, 
12
or transport of species listed on appendix I or II, 
13
and the Parties to CITES adopted a resolution in 
14
1997 (Conf. 10.8) urging the Parties to take imme-
15
diate action to demonstrably reduce the illegal trade 
16
in bear parts; 
17
(3) thousands of bears in Asia are cruelly con-
18
fined in small cages to be milked for their bile, and 
19
the wild Asian bear population has declined signifi-
20
cantly in recent years, as a result of habitat loss and 
21
poaching due to a strong demand for bear viscera 
22
used in traditional medicines and cosmetics; 
23
(4) Federal and State undercover operations 
24
have revealed that American bears have been 
25
poached for their viscera; 
26
23:46 May 26, 2021

•HR 2325 IH
(5) while most American black bear populations 
1
are generally stable or increasing, commercial trade 
2
could stimulate poaching and threaten certain popu-
3
lations if the demand for bear viscera increases; and 
4
(6) prohibitions against the importation into 
5
the United States and exportation from the United 
6
States, as well as prohibitions against the interstate 
7
trade, of bear viscera and products containing, or la-
8
beled or advertised as containing, bear viscera will 
9
assist in ensuring that the United States does not 
10
contribute to the decline of any bear population as 
11
a result of the commercial trade in bear viscera. 
12
SEC. 3. PURPOSES. 
13
The purpose of this Act is to ensure the long-term 
14
viability of the world’s 8 bear species by— 
15
(1) prohibiting interstate and international 
16
trade in bear viscera and products containing, or la-
17
beled or advertised as containing, bear viscera; 
18
(2) encouraging bilateral and multilateral ef-
19
forts to eliminate such trade; and 
20
(3) ensuring that adequate Federal legislation 
21
exists with respect to domestic trade in bear viscera 
22
and products containing, or labeled or advertised as 
23
containing, bear viscera.
