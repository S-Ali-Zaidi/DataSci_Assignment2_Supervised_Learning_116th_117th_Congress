planning process directly by forming ad hoc workgroups

in the proposal made in response to comments, and any 
10
points where the decision conflicts with the expressed re-
11
quests of any of the affected Indian Tribes or stake-
12
holders. It shall particularly address why the decision was 
13
made to disregard any such requests. The agency shall 
14
mail and, if possible, email a copy of the letter to all af-

provides an official record of the process that can be re-
8
ferred to in any litigation that may arise. The agency shall

10
umenting the process once it has begun. Such documenta-

12
an area subject to mineral activities and covered by 
13
the financial assurance, and has commenced revege-
14
tation on the regraded areas subject to mineral ac-
15
tivities in accordance with the approved plan, that 
16
portion of the total financial assurance secured for 
17
the area subject to mineral activities attributable to 
18
the completed activities may be released except that 
19
sufficient assurance must be retained to address 
20
other required reclamation and restoration needs 
21
and to assure the long-term success of the revegeta-
22
tion.

(g) EFFLUENT.—Notwithstanding section 307(b)(4), 
10
where any discharge or other water-related condition re-

order to meet the applicable effluent limitations and water 
13
quality standards, the financial assurance shall include the 
14
estimated cost of maintaining such treatment for the pro-
15
jected period that will be needed after the cessation of

mineral activities. The portion of the financial assurance 
17
attributable to such estimated cost of treatment shall not 
18
be released until the discharge has ceased for a period of 
19
5 years, as determined by ongoing monitoring and testing,
