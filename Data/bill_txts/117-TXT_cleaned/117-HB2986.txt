A BILL 
To discourage speculative oil and gas leasing and to promote 
enhanced multiple use management of public land and 
National Forest System land, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘End Speculative Oil 
4
and Gas Leasing Act of 2021’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds that— 
7
(1) Federal land should be managed for mul-
8
tiple uses, resources, and values, including recreation

use, grazing use, timber resources, mineral re-
1
sources, watershed management, wildlife and fish 
2
habitat, and natural, scenic, scientific, and historic 
3
values; 
4
(2) section 17(a) of the Mineral Leasing Act 
5
(30 U.S.C. 226(a)) authorizes the Secretary of the 
6
Interior to offer for lease only land that is ‘‘known 
7
or believed to contain oil or gas deposits’’; 
8
(3)(A) in determining whether a parcel of Fed-
9
eral land should be made available for oil and gas 
10
leasing and development, and in offering such a par-
11
cel for sale, the Secretary does not meaningfully 
12
take into consideration the oil and gas development 
13
potential of that parcel; and 
14
(B) as a result, the Secretary regularly offers 
15
and leases for oil and gas development Federal land 
16
that has no or low potential for the development of 
17
oil and gas resources (referred to in this section as 
18
‘‘no- or low-potential Federal land’’); 
19
(4)(A) no- or low-potential Federal land is fre-
20
quently leased for or near the minimum lease bid, or 
21
noncompetitively, and rarely produce oil or gas re-
22
sources; and 
23
23:55 Jun 18, 2021
H2986

•HR 2986 IH
(B) as a result, taxpayers in the United States 
1
receive minimal revenue from the leasing of no- or 
2
low-potential Federal land; 
3
(5) making no- or low-potential Federal land 
4
available for oil and gas leasing can result in leases 
5
being obtained for speculative purposes; 
6
(6) the Secretary wastes taxpayer resources in 
7
issuing and managing leases on no- or low-potential 
8
Federal land; 
9
(7) no- or low-potential Federal land frequently 
10
supports other economically important uses, re-
11
sources, and values including the uses, resources, 
12
and values described in paragraph (1); 
13
(8) the existence of leases on no- and low-poten-
14
tial Federal land can and does limit the ability of 
15
the Secretary to support and enhance the uses, re-
16
sources, and values described in paragraph (1); and 
17
(9) meaningful public participation in leasing 
18
decisions is essential and can help to ensure that the 
19
decisions of the Secretary are well-informed and 
20
based on current and reliable information and data. 
21
SEC. 3. POLICY. 
22
In accordance with Federal multiple use land man-
23
agement goals, it is the policy of the United States that— 
24
(1) the Secretary— 
25

•HR 2986 IH
(A) shall not, absent exceptional cir-
1
cumstances, offer for lease any Federal land 
2
that has low or no potential for the development 
3

4
(B) shall discourage speculation in the 
5
Federal onshore oil and gas leasing program; 
6
and 
7
(C) by not offering for lease Federal land 
8
described in subparagraph (A), shall conserve 
9
limited Federal resources that can be better ap-
10
plied elsewhere; and 
11
(2) the policies described in paragraph (1) are 
12
in keeping with, and are not detrimental to, the en-
13
ergy security of the United States.
