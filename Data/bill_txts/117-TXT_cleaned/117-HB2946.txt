Congress makes the following findings: 
8
(1) Adopted by the Organization of American 
9
States (in this Act referred to as the ‘‘OAS’’) on Oc-
10
tober 21, 2020, the Resolution Restoring Democratic 
11
Institutions and Respect for Human Rights in Nica-
12
ragua Through Free and Fair Elections (in this sec-
13
tion referred to as the ‘‘OAS Resolution’’) reiterated 
14
hemispheric concern that the government of Presi-
15

lease all political prisoners and implement agreed- 
1
upon measures to ensure freedom of expression. 
2
(2) The OAS Resolution called on the Ortega 
3
government to accept the deployment of domestic 
4
and international electoral observation missions and 
5
outlined a need for timely, inclusive negotiations to 
6
achieve meaningful electoral reforms, including the 
7
modernization of the Supreme Electoral Council, the 
8
revitalization of a pluralistic political process, and an 
9
independent audit of Nicaraguan voter rolls. 
10
(3) A November 19, 2019, report from the OAS 
11
High Level Commission on Nicaragua noted the Or-
12
tega government had engaged in significant efforts 
13
since April 2018 to curtail the fundamental rights of 
14
the citizens of Nicaragua, including repeated acts of 
15
police intimidation and at least 325 murders, which 
16
were predominately committed by government secu-
17
rity forces. 
18
(4) On April 21, 2018, Nicaraguan journalist 
19
A´ngel Gahona was killed while broadcasting live on 
20
social protests in the country. Since April 2018, the 
21
Ortega government has increased its harassment of 
22
independent media, which includes December 2019 
23
police raids of the digital newspaper Confidencial 
24
and the 100% Noticias news channel, and a Sep-

1
ing to independent broadcaster Nicavision Canal 12. 
2
(5) Since 2007, family members of President 
3
Daniel Ortega and their political allies have pur-
4
chased over a dozen TV channels, radio stations, 
5
and online news sites in Nicaragua, including Canal 
6
4, 8, and 13, Radio Nicaragua, and El 19 Digital, 
7
to increase pro-government media coverage and si-
8
lence media coverage critical of the government. 
9
(6) Sandinista National Liberation Front mem-
10
bers of the National Assembly of Nicaragua, with 
11
support from the Ortega government, recently ap-
12
proved legislation to obstruct citizen mobilization 
13
and codify the persecution of political opponents, in-
14
cluding— 
15
(A) the Foreign Agents Regulation Law on 
16
October 15, 2020, which requires civil society, 
17
nongovernmental organizations, and citizens 
18
who receive funds originating from abroad to 
19
register as ‘‘foreign agents’’, and bars them 
20
from engaging in domestic political activity; 
21
(B) the Special Cybercrimes Law on Octo-
22
ber 27, 2020, which established prison sen-
23
tences for individuals who spread information 
24
online that the Government of Nicaragua deems 
25

•HR 2946 IH
to be false or construes to cause alarm, terror, 
1
or unease in the public; 
2
(C) the Self-Determination Law on Decem-
3
ber 21, 2020, which provides President Ortega 
4
with the authority to unilaterally declare citi-
5
zens ‘‘terrorists’’ or ‘‘traitors to the homeland’’ 
6
for opposing his rule and ban them from run-
7
ning for public office, effectively preventing any 
8
individuals who supported the 2018 protests 
9
from being candidates; and 
10
(D) the reform to the Consumer Protection 
11
Law on February 4, 2021, which provides the 
12
Government of Nicaragua the authority to man-
13
date Nicaraguan commercial banks to overturn 
14
and ignore sanctions imposed by the United 
15
States with respect to persons on the list of 
16
specifically designated national and blocked per-
17
sons maintained by the Office of Foreign Assets 
18
Control of the Department of the Treasury.

(7) According to preliminary reports of the 
20
Government of Nicaragua, Hurricanes Eta and Iota, 
21
which made landfall in Nicaragua on November 3 
22
and November 16, 2020, respectively, affected more 
23
than 3,000,000 individuals and resulted in an eco-

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
7
It is the sense of Congress that— 
8
(1) ongoing efforts by the government of Presi-
9
dent Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua to suppress the 
10
voice and actions of civil society, political opponents, 
11
and independent news media violate the fundamental 
12
freedoms and basic human rights of the people of 
13
Nicaragua; 
14
(2) Congress unequivocally condemns the pas-
15
sage of the Foreign Agents Regulation Law, the 
16
Special Cybercrimes Law, and the Self-Determina-
17
tion Law by the National Assembly of Nicaragua, 
18
which represent clear attempts by the Ortega gov-
19
ernment to curtail the fundamental freedoms and 
20
basic human rights of the people of Nicaragua; 
21
(3) Congress recognizes that free, fair, and 
22
transparent elections predicated on robust reform 
23
measures and the presence of domestic and inter-
24
national observers represent the best opportunity for
