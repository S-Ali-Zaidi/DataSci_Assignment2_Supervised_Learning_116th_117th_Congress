To protect the rights of passengers with disabilities in air 
transportation, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Air Carrier Access 
4
Amendments Act of 2021’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
6
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following find-
7
ings: 
8
(1) In 1986, President Ronald Reagan signed 
9
the Air Carrier Access Act of 1986 (Public Law 99– 
10
03:26 May 01, 2021
H1696

•HR 1696 IH
435; 100 Stat. 1080), adding a provision now codi-
1
fied in section 41705 of title 49, United States Code 
2
(in this section referred to as the ‘‘ACAA’’), prohib-
3
iting disability-based discrimination in air transpor-
4
tation. 
5
(2) Despite the effort, individuals, including 
6
veterans, with disabilities continue to experience sig-
7
nificant barriers to and with traveling in air trans-
8
portation, such as— 
9
(A) damaged assistive devices; 
10
(B) inaccessible aircraft, lavatories, and 
11
communication media; 
12
(C) delayed assistance; 
13
(D) treatment of service animals; 
14
(E) inadequate disability cultural com-
15
petency; and 
16
(F) a lack of suitable seating accommoda-
17
tions. 
18
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—The following is the sense 
19
of Congress: 
20
(1) Access for individuals with disabilities in air 
21
transportation must move into the 21st century. 
22
Otherwise, individuals with disabilities will be left 
23
behind and unable to compete in today’s job market

or enjoy the opportunities available to other citizens 
1
of the United States. 
2
(2) Aircraft must be designed to accommodate 
3
individuals with disabilities and air carriers must ac-
4
quire aircraft that meet broad accessibility stand-
5
ards. 
6
(3) The ACAA must be updated to improve ac-
7
cess to air transportation for individuals with dis-
8
abilities. Legislation is necessary for the moderniza-
9
tion of standards and requirements that will 
10
strengthen accessibility in air transportation, includ-
11
ing the accessibility of aircraft. 
12
(4) The Department of Transportation and the 
13
Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compli-
14
ance Board (in this section referred to as the ‘‘Ac-
15
cess Board’’) must promulgate regulations to ensure 
16
that all passengers with disabilities receive— 
17
(A) 
prompt 
and 
effective 
boarding, 
18
deplaning, and connections between flights; 
19
(B) 
accommodations, 
including 
non-
20
standard accommodations, that safely facilitate 
21
air travel; and 
22
(C) better access to airport facilities, in-
23
cluding the provision of visually and tactilely 
24
03:26 May 01, 2021
H1696
4 
•HR 1696 IH
accessible announcements and full and equal ac-
1
cess to aural communications. 
2
(5) Legislation is necessary to ensure that indi-
3
viduals with disabilities have adequate remedies 
4
available when air carriers violate the ACAA (includ-
5
ing regulations prescribed under the ACAA). 
6
(6) Unlike other civil rights statutes, the ACAA 
7
does not contain a private right of action, which is 
8
critical to the enforcement of civil rights statutes. 
9
Legislation is necessary to correct this anomaly.
