Ali was the first child of Cassius, Sr., and Odessa 
1
Clay.

(2) Muhammad Ali was one of the most cele-
3
brated athletes of the 20th century. He produced 
4
some of America’s greatest sports memories, from 
5
winning a gold medal at the 1960 Summer Olympics 
6
to lighting the Olympic torch at the 1996 Summer 
7
Olympics. 
8
(3) After an impressive amateur career, during 
9
which he recorded 131 wins and only 7 losses and 
10
won 2 National AAU light heavyweight titles, Mu-
11
hammad Ali became the first professional boxer in 
12
history to capture the heavyweight title 3 separate 
13
times. 
14
(4) Muhammad Ali defeated every challenger he 
15
faced in the ring. But, on April 28, 1967, he was 
16
stripped of his boxing title and barred from com-
17
peting for being a conscientious objector to the war 
18
in Vietnam on religious and moral grounds. How-
19
ever, following a unanimous United States Supreme 
20
Court decision in 1971, Muhammad Ali’s conscien-
21
tious objector status was confirmed, his boxing li-
22
cense was reinstated, and he was cleared of any 
23
wrongdoing.

States.

16
fornia Bicentennial Foundation for the U.S. Con-
17
stitution for personifying the vitality of the Bill of 
18
Rights in various high-profile activities. 
19

7

recognized Muhammad Ali, including President

17
world, billions of people know Muhammad Ali as a 
18
brave, compassionate, and charming man, and the 
19
American people are proud to call Muhammad Ali 
20
one of our own’’, President Bill Clinton who stated 
21
that Muhammad Ali ‘‘captured the world’s imagina-
22
tion and its heart. Outside the ring, Muhammad Ali 
23
has dedicated his life to working for children, feed-

1
and more humane world, breaking down barriers 
2
here in America and around the world. There is no 
3
telling how many tens of millions of people had their 
4
hearts swell with pride and their eyes swell with 
5
tears in 1996 when Muhammad Ali lit the Olympic 
6
torch, because we know, now and forever, he is the 
7
greatest’’, President Jimmy Carter who cited Mu-
8
hammad Ali as ‘‘Mr. International Friendship’’, and 
9
President Barack Obama who, as a Senator, had a 
10
framed picture of Muhammad Ali hanging in his of-
11
fice, and before announcing his intentions to run for 
12
President, Obama visited with Muhammad Ali at the 
13
Ali Center in Louisville, Kentucky. 
14
(15) Muhammad Ali encouraged humanity 
15
through his perseverance and the support of thou-
16
sands of people. He helped such organizations as the 
17
Chicago-based adoption agency, The Cradle; the 
18
Make-A-Wish Foundation; the Special Olympics’ or-
19
ganization, Best Buddies; and Herbert E. Birch 
20
Services, an organization that runs a school for 
21
handicapped children and young adults, in addition 
22
to a summer camp for children with AIDS.

kinson Center in Phoenix, Arizona, and helped raise 
1
over $50,000,000 for Parkinson’s research. The 
2
Center’s mission is to provide excellence in treat-
3
ment, research, and education for patients and fami-
4
lies affected by Parkinson’s disease and other move-
5
ment disorders, regardless of their ability to pay. 
6
(17) Muhammad Ali was an inspiration to 
7
countless individuals with Parkinson’s disease, in-
8
cluding members of the Rock Steady Boxing Foun-
9
dation in Indianapolis, Indiana, which was founded 
10
to give people with Parkinson’s disease hope by im-
11
proving their quality of life using boxing for fitness. 
12
(18) Muhammad Ali was one of the founding 
13
members of Athletes for Hope, an organization cre-
14
ated by a few very successful athletes of exemplary 
15
character who have a deep commitment to charitable 
16
and community causes. 
17
(19) Muhammad Ali also established the Mu-
18
hammad Ali Center in his hometown of Louisville, 
19
Kentucky, which promotes respect, hope, and under-
20
standing, and inspires people everywhere to be as 
21
great as they can be. A visitor of the Muhammad Ali 
22
Center experiences the ‘‘hows’’ of Ali’s life: How he 
23
found the courage, the dedication, and the discipline 
24
to become a world champion; how he found the con-

viction to stand up for what he believed; and how he 
1
turned his passion for excellence in the ring to a 
2
passion for peace on the world stage. 
3
(20) Like Muhammad Ali himself, the Muham-
4
mad Ali Center focuses on what brings individuals 
5
together, not what sets them apart, and is a ‘‘global 
6
gathering place’’ to which people can come, both on-
7
line and in person, to learn, share, and celebrate our 
8
commonalities as human beings and to formulate 
9
ways of advancing humanity. 
10
(21) Muhammad Ali helped to provide more 
11
than 22,000,000 aid packets to assist people in 
12
need, and until the last years of his life, he traveled, 
13
on average, more than 200 days per year for human-
14
itarian causes. 
15
(22) Muhammad Ali, known simply as ‘‘the 
16
greatest,’’ transcended the glamour and glory of 
17
being a sports champion to become not only one of 
18
the greatest sports figures, but one of the greatest 
19
role models of our time. 
20
(23) On June 3, 2016, Muhammad Ali died at 
21
the age of 74.
