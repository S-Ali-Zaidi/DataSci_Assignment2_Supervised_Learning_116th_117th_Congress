SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE. 
1
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The Mississippi River flows more than 
3
2,300 miles from its source at Lake Itasca through 
4
the center of the continental United States to the 
5
Gulf of Mexico. 
6
(2) The main stem of the Mississippi River 
7
flows through 10 States that collectively are home to 
8
55.4 million people as of 2019. 
9
(3) The Mississippi River provides drinking 
10
water to more than 20 million people in 50 cities. 
11
(4) The Mississippi River drives a vibrant nat-
12
ural resource and recreation-based economy that 
13
generates nearly $500 billion in annual revenue and 
14
directly employs more than 1.5 million people. 
15
(5) The Mississippi River and its 30 million 
16
acre floodplain provide an ecological lifeline for all of 
17
North America, supporting more than 780 species of 
18
fish and wildlife and providing a vital migration cor-
19
ridor for 60 percent of all North American birds and 
20
40 percent of the migratory waterfowl in the United 
21
States. 
22
(6) The Mississippi River serves as a major 
23
transportation corridor for grain and cargo. 
24
(7) Congress has designated the Mississippi 
25
River System as a nationally significant ecosystem 
26
23:14 Jul 13, 2021
H4202
3 
•HR 4202 IH
and a nationally significant navigation system and is 
1
the only inland river system to receive both designa-
2
tions. 
3
(8) Despite its critical value to the United 
4
States, the Mississippi River is in a severe state of 
5
ecological decline, as documented by the United 
6
States Geological Survey, the Army Corps of Engi-
7
neers, and other Federal and State agencies. 
8
(9) Modifications to the Mississippi River have 
9
resulted in the extensive loss of wetlands and com-
10
plex river habitats causing profound harm to the 
11
treasured fish and wildlife resources in the United 
12
States and increasing flood risks to communities. 
13
(10) Polluted runoff has drastically reduced 
14
water quality and created a massive dead zone in the 
15
Gulf of Mexico. 
16
(11) Invasive aquatic species threaten the eco-
17
logical integrity of the Mississippi River and Gulf of 
18
Mexico, and the fisheries and recreation that rely on 
19
a healthy ecosystem. 
20
(12) Ecological degradation of the Mississippi 
21
River has resulted in— 
22
(A) more flooding; 
23
(B) less wildlife; 
24
(C) fewer jobs; 
25
23:14 Jul 13, 2021
H4202

•HR 4202 IH
(D) reduced recreational opportunities; and 
1
(E) higher costs for keeping communities 
2
safe and ensuring that communities have clean 
3
drinking water. 
4
(13) The consequences of ecological degradation 
5
have disproportionately harmed rural communities, 
6
economically disadvantaged communities, and com-
7
munities of color. 
8
(14) Existing Federal programs lack sufficient 
9
coordination, funding, and participation with States, 
10
Tribes, local governments, and nongovernmental or-
11
ganizations to address these ongoing challenges and 
12
reverse the decline of the Mississippi River. 
13
(b) PURPOSE.—It is the purpose of this Act to estab-
14
lish the Mississippi River Restoration and Resilience Ini-
15
tiative to protect and restore the ecological health and re-
16
silience of the Mississippi River for current and succeeding 
17
generations of Americans and for the fish and wildlife that 
18
rely on the Mississippi River and its floodplain. The 
19
MRRRI is a nonregulatory initiative that will build upon 
20
existing efforts and provide funding for projects and ac-
21
tivities to protect and restore the nationally significant re-
22
sources of the Mississippi River by— 
23
(1) establishing the Mississippi River National 
24
Program Office;

(2) establishing the focus areas and identifying 
1
qualifying activities for MRRRI programs and 
2
projects; 
3
(3) directing the development of actionable 
4
goals, an action plan, and a science plan, and reg-
5
ular updates to such plans, to guide the MRRRI; 
6
(4) establishing criteria for measuring the suc-
7
cess of the MRRRI in restoring the ecological health 
8
and resilience of the Mississippi River; 
9
(5) requiring the Environmental Protection 
10
Agency to coordinate and consult with Federal and 
11
non-Federal stakeholders to implement the MRRRI; 
12
and

(6) establishing the Mississippi River Corridor
