RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the International Olympic Committee failed to adhere 
to its own human rights commitments. 
Whereas, on November 2, 2021, 3-time Olympian Peng Shuai 
went missing after she said in a since-deleted post on 
Chinese social media site Weibo that she had been sexu-
ally assaulted and forced into a sexual relationship with 
Zhang Gaoli, who was the Chinese Communist Party’s 
Vice Premier from 2013 to 2018; 
Whereas Chinese Communist Party authorities have imposed 
a media and internet blackout of discussions of Peng’s 
case, and the words ‘‘tennis’’ and the surname ‘‘Peng’’ 
have been censored online within the People’s Republic of 
China;

Whereas, on November 14, 2021, after Peng had not been 
seen or heard from for 12 days, Women’s Tennis Asso-
ciation (WTA) CEO Steve Simon requested a ‘‘full and 
transparent’’ investigation into Peng’s allegations; 
Whereas the hashtag ‘‘#WhereIsPengShuai’’ trended across 
social media worldwide, with the exception of the People’s 
Republic of China where it is censored; 
Whereas, on November 17, 2021, the WTA received a state-
ment purporting to be from Peng, recanting her abuse 
claim and saying ‘‘everything is fine’’; 
Whereas, in response, WTA CEO Steve Simon said the re-
sponse ‘‘released today by Chinese state media con-
cerning Peng Shuai only raises my concerns as to her 
safety and whereabouts’’; 
Whereas, in response, the International Olympic Committee 
(IOC) said in a statement that it was ‘‘encouraged by as-
surance that she is safe’’; 
Whereas, on November 19 and 20, 2021, photos and videos 
of Peng appearing in her home, in a restaurant, and at 
a youth tennis event in Beijing emerged on Twitter ac-
counts affiliated with government-run media, and at the 
same time, Peng has not spoken directly with the media 
or the WTA; 
Whereas, on November 19, 2021, White House Press Sec-
retary Jen Psaki said the White House is ‘‘deeply con-
cerned’’ over Peng’s disappearance and seeks ‘‘inde-
pendent and verifiable proof’’ of her location and condi-
tion; 
Whereas, on November 19, 2021, Liz Throssell, the spokes-
person of the United Nations Human Rights office, told 
reporters ‘‘. . . it would be important to have proof of

her whereabouts and wellbeing, and we would urge that 
there be an investigation with full transparency into her 
allegations of sexual assault’’; 
Whereas, on November 21, 2021, the IOC said in a state-
ment that its President, Thomas Bach, had a 30-minute 
video call with 3-time Olympian Peng Shuai, joined by a 
Chinese sports official and an IOC official; 
Whereas the statement said that, during the call, Peng ap-
peared to be ‘‘doing fine’’ and ‘‘relaxed’’, and said she 
‘‘would like to have her privacy respected’’; 
Whereas the IOC did not explain how the video call with 
Peng had been organized, given the difficulties other con-
cerned parties have had reaching her; 
Whereas, on November 30, 2021, IOC official Dick Pound in 
an interview with CNN defended the Chinese Govern-
ment’s handling of the situation and said the ‘‘unanimous 
conclusion’’ by IOC officials on the call is that Peng 
Shuai is ‘‘fine’’; 
Whereas the annual report of the Congressional-Executive 
Commission on China for 2020 finds that gender-based 
violence in the People’s Republic of China remains a seri-
ous issue, and highly publicized cases of sexual assault 
continue to surface; 
Whereas the IOC’s acquiescence to the Chinese Communist 
Party regarding Peng’s sexual assault allegations and 
safety concerns diminish global demands for the Chinese 
Communist Party to investigate Peng’s allegations 
through a transparent and comprehensive process; 
Whereas the role of IOC leadership in collaborating with Chi-
nese Communist Party officials to cover up Peng Shuai’s 
allegations of sexual assault and disappearance call into

Whereas the IOC has provided the Beijing Organising Com-
mittee for the 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Games, con-
trolled by the Chinese Communist Party, approximately 
$890,00,000 ‘‘to ease the financial burden on the host
