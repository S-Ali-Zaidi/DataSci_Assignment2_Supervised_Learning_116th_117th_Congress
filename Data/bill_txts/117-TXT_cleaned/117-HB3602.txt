grade 12 computer science education. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Computer science is transforming industry, 
3
creating new fields of commerce, driving innovation, 
4
and bolstering productivity. By 2029, computer 
5
science and information jobs are expected to grow by 
6
11 percent, faster than the average of any other oc-
7
cupation. 
8
(2) However, as of 2019, the more than 
9
900,000 computing and tech jobs unfilled in the 
10
United States suggests that our students are not 
11
being prepared to meet the demands of a 21st cen-
12
tury economy. It is projected that there will be 
13
8,000,000 new jobs in the technology sector by 2028 
14
and 3,500,000 computing-related jobs by 2026, how-
15
ever, the current state of computer science education 
16
will only prepare enough computer science profes-
17
sionals to fill 19 percent of these jobs. 
18
(3) Knowledge of computer science and use of 
19
technology is increasingly essential for all individ-
20
uals, not just those working or planning to work in 
21
the technology sector. 
22
(4) Providing students with computer science 
23
education in elementary school and secondary school 
24
is critical for student success, and strengthening the 
25
workforce of a 21st century economy.

•HR 3602 IH
(5) While an estimated 90 percent of parents 
1
want computer science taught in their children’s 
2
schools, just 45 percent of all elementary schools 
3
and secondary schools offer high-quality computer 
4
science instruction that includes programming and 
5
coding. 
6
(6) Black and Hispanic workers in the science 
7
and engineering workforce continue to be underrep-
8
resented. Black employees represent 13 percent of 
9
the United States workforce, but only 5.6 percent of 
10
the science and engineering workforce. Hispanic em-
11
ployees represent 17 percent of the United States 
12
workforce, but only 7.5 percent of the science and 
13
engineering workforce. 
14
(7) While underrepresented minority students 
15
overall face an opportunity gap in STEAM edu-
16
cation, women of color particularly face an achieve-
17
ment gap in science and engineering education. In 
18
2019, while women were conferred nearly a third of 
19
all science and engineering degrees, women of color 
20
received only 13 percent (Black: 3.2 percent; His-
21
panic: 3.9 percent; Native American or Alaskan Na-
22
tive: 0.2 percent; Asian or Pacific Islander: 4.5 per-
23
cent; and multiracial: 1.2 percent). 
24

•HR 3602 IH
(8) In 2018, of all engineering technologies and 
1
engineering-related bachelor level-related studies, 
2
only 3 percent of nationwide enrollment was rep-
3
resented by Black students, while just 10 percent 
4
were represented by Hispanic students. 
5
(9) Women overall face challenges in accessing 
6
computer science education. Only 18 percent of all 
7
bachelor’s degrees conferred in computer science 
8
went to women in 2015, and women of color received 
9
only 9 percent of degrees (Black: 3 percent; His-
10
panic: 2 percent; Native American or Alaska Native: 
11
0.8 percent; and Asian or Pacific islander: 3 per-
12
cent). 
13
(10) Disparities in enrollment and academic 
14
achievement start early. In 2019, only 24 percent of 
15
students taking either AP Computer Science exams 
16
were women, and just 16 percent were African 
17
American, Latino, or Native Hawaiian/other Pacific 
18
Islander. 
19
(11) Nationwide, only 88 Native American stu-
20
dents took the AP Computer Science exam in 2016, 
21
a decrease from 2015. This means that while Native 
22
Americans make up about 1.1 percent of the United 
23
States student population, they made up 1/5 of a 
24
18:02 Jul 08, 2021
H3602
5 
•HR 3602 IH
percent of students who took AP Computer Science 
1
exams in 2016. 
2
(12) In 2019, just 18 percent of the Depart-
3
ment of Education discretionary and research grants 
4
in STEAM were awarded to computer science-fo-
5
cused programs and less than half of high schools 
6
offered any computer science classes. 
7
(13) Lack of universal computer science edu-
8
cation is evident in the lack of a widespread tech in-
9
dustry, which is overwhelmingly concentrated in a 
10
few cities nationwide. Tech industry entrepreneur-
11
ship is concentrated in just a few States and com-
12
puter science education is limited to affluent schools 
13
and students, placing low-income, minority, and 
14
rural communities at risk of being left behind.
