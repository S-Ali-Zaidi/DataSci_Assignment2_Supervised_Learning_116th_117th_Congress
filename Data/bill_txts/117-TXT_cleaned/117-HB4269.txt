(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:

(2) The number of small commercial dairy op-
1
erations has declined from 146,685 in 1987 to 
2
30,373 in 2017. 
3
(3) The number of licensed dairy herds fell by 
4
more than half between 2002 and 2019, despite milk 
5
production continuing to grow. 
6
(4) The loss of dairy operations poses signifi-
7
cant economic challenges to many rural communities 
8
with historic ties to dairy farming. 
9
(5) A diverse and cross-regional dairy industry 
10
is critical for food security and resiliency in the 
11
United States. 
12
(6) Continued declines of approximately 4 per-
13
cent of dairy farms annually will negatively impact 
14
rural communities throughout the country. 
15
(7) In 2016, dairy farmers of all herd sizes 
16
below 1,000 cows experienced higher total costs than 
17
gross returns. 
18

19
consin licensed dairy farms more than doubled from 
20
2016 levels. 
21
(b) ESTABLISHMENT.—Not later than 6 months after 
22
the date on which funds are first made available to carry 
23
out this section, the Secretary shall establish a commission
