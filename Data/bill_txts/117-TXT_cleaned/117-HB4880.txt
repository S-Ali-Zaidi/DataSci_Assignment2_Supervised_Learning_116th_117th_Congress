SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Veterans’ Prostate 
4
Cancer Treatment and Research Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress makes the following findings: 
7
(1) Prostate cancer is the number one cancer 
8
diagnosed in the Veterans Health Administration.

(2) A 1996 report published by the National 
1
Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine es-
2
tablished a link between prostate cancer and expo-
3
sure to herbicides, such as Agent Orange. 
4
(3) It is essential to acknowledge that due to 
5
these circumstances, certain veterans are made 
6
aware that they are high-risk individuals when it 
7
comes to the potential to develop prostate cancer. 
8
(4) In being designated as ‘‘high risk’’, it is es-
9
sential that veterans are proactive in seeking earlier 
10
preventative clinical services for the early detection 
11
and successful treatment of prostate cancer, whether 
12
that be through the Veterans Health Administration 
13
or through a community provider. 
14
(5) Clinical preventative services and initial de-
15
tection are some of the most important components 
16
in the early detection of prostate cancer for veterans 
17
at high risk of prostate cancer. 
18
(6) For veterans with prostate cancer, including 
19
prostate cancer that has metastasized, precision on-
20
cology, including biomarker-driven clinical trials and 
21
innovations underway through the Prostate Cancer 
22
Foundation and Department of Veterans Affairs 
23
partnership, represents one of the most promising
