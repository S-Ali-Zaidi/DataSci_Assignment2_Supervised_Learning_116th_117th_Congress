SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS. 
1
(a) SHORT TITLE.—This Act may be cited as the 
2
‘‘Ending Secrecy About Workplace Harassment Act’’. 
3
(b) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that the following: 
4
(1) Thirty years after the United States Su-
5
preme Court held in Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson 
6
that workplace harassment creates a hostile or abu-
7
sive work environment and is a violation of title VII 
8
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, sexual harassment 
9
remains a widespread problem, affecting victims in 
10
every industry, at every level of employment. 
11
(2) In fiscal year 2020, the Equal Employment 
12
Opportunity Commission (in this Act referred to as 
13
the ‘‘Commission’’) received 67,448 charges of work-
14
place discrimination. The most frequently cited claim 
15
was retaliation with 37,632 charges, which made up 
16
55.8 percent of all charges filed. This was followed 
17
by disability with 24,324 charges (36.1 percent), 
18
race with 22,064 charges (32.7 percent), sex with 
19
21,398 charges (31.7 percent), age with 14,183 
20
charges (21.0 percent), national origin with 6,377 
21
charges (9.5 percent), color with 3,562 charges (5.3 
22
percent), religion with 2,404 charges (3.6 percent), 
23
and genetic information with 440 charges (0.7 per-
24
cent).

•HR 8618 IH
(3) An analysis of the Commission’s charge 
1
data between 2012 and 2016 shows that many indi-
2
viduals experience multiple bases of harassment. For 
3
example, 1 in 17 women who filed sexual harassment 
4
charges during this period experienced racialized 
5
sexual harassment, or harassment based not only on 
6
their sex but also their race. In addition, over 35 
7
percent of women also alleged retaliation. 
8
(4) According to the Commission’s Select Task 
9
Force in 2016, on the Study of Harassment in the 
10
Workplace, the prevalence of workplace harassment, 
11
and in particular sexual harassment— 
12
(A) causes mental and physical harm to 
13
the victim, which can include symptoms of de-
14
pression, 
general 
stress 
and 
anxiety, 
15
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and 
16
overall impaired psychological well-being; and 
17
(B) results in mental and physical harms 
18
to those that observe or perceive mistreatment 
19
in the workplace, as one study concluded ‘‘em-
20
ployees, female and male alike, who observed 
21
hostility directed toward female coworkers (both 
22
incivility and sexually harassing behavior) were 
23
more likely to experience lower psychological 
24

•HR 8618 IH
well-being’’, which were ‘‘in turn linked to lower 
1
physical well-being’’. 
2
(5) Prevalence of harassment in the workplace 
3
causes substantial financial harm to victims, as they 
4
often try to avoid the harassing behavior by taking 
5
leave without pay or leaving the workplace entirely, 
6
resulting in a loss of wages. The U.S. Merit Systems 
7
Protection Board’s 1995 report on Sexual Harass-
8
ment in the Federal Workplace found sexual harass-
9
ment cost Federal employees $4,400,000 between 
10
1992 and 1994. 
11
(6) According to Commission records, in fiscal 
12
year 2020, the Commission secured $439,200,000 
13
for victims of discrimination in the private sector 
14
and State and local government workplaces through 
15
voluntary resolutions and litigation. 
16
(7) The Commission is responsible for enforcing 
17
Federal anti-discrimination laws that protect job ap-
18
plicants and employees, and has the authority to in-
19
vestigate charges of discrimination against employ-
20
ers who are covered by the law.
