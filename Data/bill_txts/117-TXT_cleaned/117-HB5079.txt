a 
novel 
(new)

coronavirus known as SARS–CoV–2 was first de-
2

ease COVID–19 that has now spread globally.

(2) Secretary Azar declared a Public Health 
6
Emergency under section 319 of the Public Health 
7

13
the United States constitutes a national emergency, 
14
beginning March 1, 2020.

(4) In order to catalyze and stabilize consistent 
16
growth in the economy, schools must be protected
