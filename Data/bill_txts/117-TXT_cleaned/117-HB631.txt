at 20,000 to 25,000 bears, up from as low as 5,000 
1
to 10,000 bears in the 1950s and 1960s. 
2
(2) A 2002 United States Geological Survey of 
3
wildlife in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge Coast-
4
al Plain noted that the polar bear populations ‘‘may 
5
now be near historic highs’’. 
6
(3) A permit fee for importing polar bears will 
7
invigorate the public-private funding partnership for 
8
the United States-Russian Polar Bear Conservation 
9
Fund. 
10
(4) TRAFFIC, the wildlife trade monitoring 
11
network, has stated both that ‘‘the global population 
12
of Polar Bears is not small and the species’ area of 
13
distribution is not restricted,’’ and ‘‘[t]rade does not 
14
appear to be a significant threat to the species.’’. 
15
TRAFFIC also recommended that the polar bear 
16
not be uplisted to appendix 1 at the 16th Conference 
17
of the Parties of the Convention on International 
18
Trade of Endangered Species of Fauna and Flora 
19
(CITES). 
20
(5) The International Union for Conservation of 
21
Nature (IUCN)/Species Survival Commission (SSC) 
22
Polar Bear Specialist Group (PBSG), has stated 
23
that further trade restrictions on the polar bear are 
24
‘‘unlikely to confer a conservation benefit, and could

have a negative impact on socioeconomic systems as 
1
well as domestic and international partnerships’’. 
2
(6) The International Union for Conservation of 
3
Nature has found that ‘‘hunting is a form of wildlife 
4
use that, when well-managed, may assist in fur-
5
thering conservation objectives by creating the rev-
6
enue and economic incentives for the management 
7
and conservation of the target species and its habi-
8
tat, as well as supporting local livelihoods’’.
