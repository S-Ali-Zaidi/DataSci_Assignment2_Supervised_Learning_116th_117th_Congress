A BILL 
To permit civil actions against the United States or any 
State or local government entity for COVID–19 vaccina-
tion mandates. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Protecting Americans’

Medical Rights Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
The Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Government-imposed COVID–19 vaccine 
8
mandates that threaten Americans’ jobs and liveli-

hoods are authoritarian, unnecessary, overreaching, 
1
irrational, and needlessly divisive, and lack a pur-
2
ported scientific basis for public health needs. 
3
(2) The policy of the United States is to recog-
4
nize, defend, and protect the inherent rights of the 
5
individual, including the right of liberty, the right to 
6
be secure in one’s person, the right of the individual 
7
to be informed about any medical procedures, treat-
8
ment, or vaccination, and the right of the individual 
9
to provide or withhold consent to such procedures, 
10
treatment, or vaccination. 
11
(3) Data from the Centers for Disease Control 
12
and Prevention (CDC) confirm that while COVID– 
13
19 vaccination can lessen the severity of illness for 
14
individuals in certain higher risk categories, it 
15
DOES NOT preclude Americans from contracting, 
16
spreading, or being hospitalized by the COVID–19 
17
virus. 
18
(4) As a medical matter, the COVID–19 vac-
19
cine may not be appropriate for everyone. Because 
20
of potential risks that COVID–19 vaccines may pose 
21
to certain people, it is important that every patient 
22
be able to consult his or her doctor or other medical 
23
health care provider to determine whether one of the 
24
COVID–19 vaccines is safe and appropriate. 
25

•HR 6811 IH
(5) A significant body of peer-reviewed sci-
1
entific studies concludes that COVID–19 vaccines 
2
are among a wide range of clinical public health 
3
tools available and accessible to Americans for miti-
4
gating the effects of the COVID–19 virus. 
5
(6) Other scientifically confirmed clinical safe-
6
guard tools for mitigating and protecting against 
7
COVID–19 include— 
8
(A) the durable and lasting protection of 
9
natural immunity from previous COVID–19 in-
10
fection; 
11
(B) therapeutics, including oral antiviral 
12
medications; 
13
(C) periodic testing; 
14
(D) air filtration or purification systems; 
15
(E) choosing to wear masks, shields, and 
16
other personal protective equipment (PPE); 
17
(F) remote work settings; and 
18
(G) social distancing. 
19
(7) Wise and constitutionally permissible gov-
20
ernment policies aimed at mitigating adverse public 
21
health effects from COVID–19 must be based on 
22
clear and consistent scientific evidence, while re-
23
specting the fundamental individual liberties and 
24
freedoms enshrined in the Constitution. Such poli-
25
22:02 Mar 01, 2022
H6811

•HR 6811 IH
cies must also seek the path or combinations of 
1
paths that least infringe on individual liberties to 
2
achieve public health gains. 
3
(8) Due in large part to the vacillating, arbi-
4
trary, inconsistent, and at times nontransparent and 
5
scientifically tenuous COVID–19 guidances issued 
6
by the CDC and other government agencies, Ameri-
7
cans may have legitimate questions, concerns, and 
8
confusion about what best serves their medical needs 
9
with respect to the COVID–19 virus. 
10
(9) Americans holding such legitimate questions 
11
and concerns—or being opposed to COVID–19 vac-
12
cine mandates—DOES NOT equate to their being 
13
‘‘antivaccine’’ or ‘‘antiscience’’. It is altogether and 
14
entirely consistent for Americans to be ‘‘provaccine’’ 
15
for what makes sense for their and their family’s 
16
personal health needs in consultation with their 
17
board-certified physician or other health care pro-
18
vider, and also be ‘‘antivaccine mandate’’. 
19
(10) To date, there is no scientific data to sug-
20
gest employment settings pose any increased or spe-
21
cial risk for COVID–19 transmission among individ-
22
uals, as compared to home, social, or other gath-
23
erings. 
24

•HR 6811 IH
(11) The protection of individual rights to make 
1
one’s own medical decisions in consultation with 
2
one’s health care provider—without fear of coercion, 
3
forced vaccination, loss of civil liberties, or risk of 
4
adverse employment action—is especially needed at 
5
a time when it is critical for the Nation to increase 
6
trust in public health officials. Protection of these 
7
individual rights is also vital for encouraging, where 
8
and when medically appropriate, vaccination or other 
9
scientific measures for keeping Americans safe and 
10
healthy. 
11
(12) Under current law, Americans who sustain 
12
adverse health effects or injuries resulting from 
13
COVID–19 vaccination generally have minimal and 
14
restricted compensation recourses. They are gen-
15
erally confined to the notoriously stingy Counter-
16
measures Injury Compensation Program (CICP). 
17
(13) The CICP is managed through an admin-
18
istrative process, where there is no court, judge, or 
19
right to appeal. Decisions about compensation are 
20
made in a figurative black hole by a nameless ad-
21
ministrator. Compensation for lost wages and death 
22
benefits are arbitrarily capped, there is no oppor-
23
tunity for collecting damages for pain and suffering, 
24
and there is only a one-year statutory limit for mak-
25
22:02 Mar 01, 2022
H6811

•HR 6811 IH
ing a claim. In addition, there is no compensation 
1
for attorney fees, which makes it extremely difficult 
2
for vaccine-injured Americans to find counsel willing 
3
to represent them. 
4
(14) Since the advent of the COVID–19 vac-
5
cines and as of February 1, 2022, there have been 
6
NO compensation awards issued by the CICP for 
7
COVID–19 vaccine injury claims. 
8
(15) The United States constitutional structure 
9
demands measures of accountability for government 
10
actions that infringe individual liberties and could 
11
cause harm. If Congress or the courts fail to nullify, 
12
overturn, or invalidate unnecessary, authoritarian, 
13
and overreaching COVID–19 vaccine mandates that 
14
threaten the loss of employment for noncompliance, 
15
Americans oppressed by such mandates and coerced 
16
into vaccination should be able to hold governments 
17
accountable. They should have full and unfettered 
18
access to legal recourses for any adverse health ef-
19
fects or injuries sustained from such COVID–19 
20
vaccine mandates. This should include the right to 
21
bring civil actions for declaratory or injunctive relief, 
22
or monetary compensatory damages, including eco-
23
nomic and noneconomic damages, against Federal, 
24
22:02 Mar 01, 2022
H6811
7 
•HR 6811 IH
State, and local government entities that impose 
1
such mandates. 
2
(16) It is well-established that Congress’ power 
3
under article I, section 8, clause 1 of the Constitu-
4
tion, also known as the Spending Clause, includes 
5
the power to require the States to abide by certain 
6
conditions in exchange for receiving Federal finan-
7
cial assistance. The Supreme Court has explained 
8
that one such lawful condition may be States volun-
9
tarily waiving their sovereign immunity from suit 
10
(under the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution 
11
or otherwise). South Dakota v. Dole (483 U.S. 203 
12
(1987)); College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid 
13
Postsecondary Education Expense Board (527 U.S. 
14
666 (1999)). 
15
(17) Such a conditional waiver does not coerce 
16
a State. The Supreme Court has explicitly recog-
17
nized that when Congress expresses a funding condi-
18
tion ‘‘unambiguously’’, a State’s acceptance of Fed-
19
eral funds constitutes a knowing agreement to a 
20
congressionally imposed condition on the funds. 
21
Pennhurst State School & Hospital v. Halderman 
22
(451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981)). Accordingly, while Con-
23
gress may not compel States to waive their sovereign 
24
22:02 Mar 01, 2022
H6811
8 
•HR 6811 IH
immunity, a voluntary State waiver is wholly permis-
1
sible. Alden v. Maine (527 U.S. 706 (1999)). 
2
(18) This Act protects Americans’ constitu-
3
tional medical rights by ensuring that individuals 
4
subject to a scientifically tenuous ‘‘Hobson’s Choice’’ 
5
of employment-threatening COVID–19 vaccine man-
6
date, where they feel forced into vaccination against 
7
their will, are able to seek equitable and appropriate 
8
legal remedies for any COVID–19 vaccine injuries, 
9
remedies that are extremely limited or disallowed 
10
under current law. 
11
(19) This Act further protects Americans’ con-
12
stitutional medical rights by holding Federal, State, 
13
and local governments accountable for unnecessary, 
14
irrational, 
overreaching, 
and 
liberty-infringing 
15
COVID–19 vaccine mandates, when many other sci-
16
entifically proven, and less liberty-intrusive, tools 
17
exist for mitigating the effects of and protecting 
18
against COVID–19.
