Whereas schools, under political pressure, have implemented 
critical race theory, which teaches children to divide 
themselves from their classmates, as part of curricula; 
Whereas schools have implemented mask mandates, jeopard-
izing learning potential and disrupting classrooms; 
Whereas schools have implemented vaccine mandates in viola-
tion of personal choice and medical freedom, thereby cre-
ating thousands of teacher vacancies nationwide; 
Whereas parents have exercised their protected First Amend-
ment right to assemble and express concerns at school 
board meetings; 
Whereas interest groups, in response to parents participating 
out of concern for policies impacting their children’s well- 
being and safety, requested the Department of Justice 
label parents as ‘‘domestic terrorists’’; 
Whereas, on October 4, 2021, the Attorney General, as ap-
pointed by the President, has directed the Federal Bu-
reau of Investigation to prosecute parents who exercise 
their First Amendment rights at school board meetings; 
and 
Whereas, on October 15, 2021, sitting members of the United 
States Commission on Civil Rights wrote to the Attorney 
General to express concern that protected political speech 
by parents could be prosecuted under the October 4 di-
rective, in direct violation of their First Amendment 
rights, because of political disagreement: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
