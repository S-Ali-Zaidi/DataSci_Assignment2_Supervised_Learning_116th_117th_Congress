A BILL 
To establish requirements relating to credit scores and 
educational credit scores, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Free Credit Scores 
4
for Consumers Act of 2021’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) While nationwide consumer reporting agen-
8
cies (‘‘CRAs’’) are required by law to supply con-
9
sumers with a free copy of their credit report annu-

ally, they can charge consumers to obtain a credit 
1
score disclosure. 
2
(2) A July 2011 report by the Consumer Fi-
3
nancial Protection Bureau (‘‘Consumer Bureau’’) ti-
4
tled ‘‘The Impact of Differences between Consumer- 
5
and Creditor-Purchased Credit Scores’’ found that 
6
the credit scores made available to and purchased by 
7
consumers from CRAs are unlikely to be the same 
8
credit scores used by creditors and lenders to evalu-
9
ate consumers’ creditworthiness. 
10
(3) That report found that the scarcity of pub-
11
lic educational tools to inform consumers of the dif-
12
ferences among credit scores, the large combined 
13
market share and brand recognition of FICO credit 
14
scores, and the marketing practices of some credit 
15
score sellers may perpetuate consumers’ confusion 
16
about credit scores. As a result, some consumers 
17
may be purchasing an educational credit score or 
18
subscribing to a credit monitoring service sold by a 
19
CRA, without realizing the limitations and useful-
20
ness of these products and services. 
21
(4) Similarly, a September 2012 Consumer Bu-
22
reau report titled ‘‘Analysis of Differences between 
23
Consumer- and Creditor-Purchased Credit Scores’’ 
24
found that consumers do not know before they pur-
25
00:30 Jul 10, 2021
H4078
3 
•HR 4078 IH
chase a credit score from a CRA whether this credit 
1
score will closely track or vary significantly from the 
2
credit score sold to creditors or lenders. Given the 
3
lack of transparency about the usefulness of credit 
4
scores that are marketed for purchase by consumers 
5
from CRAs and the resulting consumer confusion, 
6
the Consumer Bureau recommended that companies 
7
selling scores to consumers clearly inform consumers 
8
that the scores marketed to consumers for purchase 
9
by CRAs can vary, sometimes substantially, from 
10
the scores that are actually sold to and used by 
11
creditors and lenders. 
12
(5) A February 2011 study by Consumer Fed-
13
eration of America and VantageScore also found 
14
that half of the consumers surveyed did not know 
15
that a credit score is designed to indicate the risk 
16
of not repaying a credit obligation. Consumers also 
17
did not know who makes credit scores available, 
18
what numerical range constitutes excellent credit 
19
standing, or the financial implications of having a 
20
low credit score. 
21
(6) Many consumers do not realize that they 
22
have more than just ‘‘one’’ credit score. Because the 
23
submission of credit information to CRAs is vol-
24
untary and not all furnishers submit information to 
25
00:30 Jul 10, 2021
H4078
4 
•HR 4078 IH
every CRA, the information contained in a report 
1
also varies among CRAs. As a result, the credit 
2
score generated by each CRA is also likely to vary, 
3
resulting in potentially different credit decisions 
4
based on an evaluation of different credit reports ob-
5
tained from different CRAs. 
6
(7) A February 2015 Consumer Bureau report 
7
titled ‘‘Consumer Voices on Credit Reports and 
8
Scores’’ found that consumers had questions about 
9
what actions to take to improve their scores once 
10
they had seen them, suggesting that additional dis-
11
closures and educational content would be helpful to 
12
consumers. The Consumer Bureau found that con-
13
sumers were confused by conflicting advice on how 
14
to improve their scores. 
15
(8) That report also noted that consumers 
16
found the process for obtaining consumer reports 
17
and credit scores confusing. Consumers also were 
18
uncertain about whether, and under what cir-
19
cumstances, they could obtain a consumer report for 
20
free.

15
sumer’s creditworthiness in deciding whether to 
16
make a loan or extend credit to that consumer.

‘‘(3) KEY
FACTORS.—The term ‘key factors’
