RESOLUTION 
Condemning the murder of Alireza Fazeli Monfared and the 
practice of so-called ‘‘honor killings’’ in Iran, and for 
other purposes. 
Whereas Alireza Fazeli Monfared, a 20-year-old citizen of 
Iran, reportedly was brutally murdered by relatives on 
May 4, 2021, in a rural village near Ahvaz, Iran; 
Whereas Mr. Monfared’s murder was reportedly perpetrated 
as an ‘‘honor killing’’ because Mr. Monfared identified as 
a gay man; 
Whereas the denial of fundamental freedoms and the equal 
protection of the law on any basis, including sexual ori-
entation, is contrary to international human rights con-
ventions, including the United Nations Charter and the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights;

Whereas Iran’s failure to adequately dissuade the abhorrent 
practice of ‘‘honor killings’’ has led to the murders of 
women, girls, and other vulnerable populations deprived 
of agency and justice; 
Whereas officials in Iran do not uniformly prosecute ‘‘honor 
killings’’ under its qisas legal system and, when prosecu-
tions do occur, penalties are often significantly reduced, 
or prosecutions are dismissed at the insistence of family 
members of the charged; 
Whereas Iran does not publish official statistics on the num-
ber of suspected ‘‘honor killings’’ thus likely severely 
undercounting the number of instances in which these 
murders take place; and 
Whereas Iran offers no public reports or statistics related to 
the prosecutions of those responsible for ‘‘honor killings’’, 
leaving the illegality of such killings unclear, and failing 
to provide accountability for repeated instances of ‘‘honor 
killings’’ in the country: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-
1
resentatives that— 
2
(1) the murder of Mr. Alireza Fazali Monfared 
3
was an abhorrent crime that should be thoroughly 
4
investigated and fully prosecuted; 
5
(2) the practice of ‘‘honor killings’’ in Iran, 
6
which has claimed the lives of women, girls, gay 
7
men, persons that identify as transgender, and mem-
8
bers of other vulnerable populations, is a violation of 
9
internationally recognized human rights; and
