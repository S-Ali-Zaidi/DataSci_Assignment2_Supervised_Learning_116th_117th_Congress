•HR 5646 IH
(1) The Supreme Court of the United States 
1
has repeatedly held that the government may not in-
2
carcerate an individual solely because of the inability 
3
of the individual to pay a fine or fee. 
4
(2) In 2019, the United States Court of Ap-
5
peals for the Fifth Circuit ruled that it is unconsti-
6
tutional to imprison people for failing to pay fines 
7
and fees without inquiring into their ability to pay. 
8
The Fifth Circuit also ruled that it is unconstitu-
9
tional for judges to determine ability to pay when 
10
court debts help pay court budgets. 
11
(3) Under section 3142 of title 18, United 
12
States Code, Federal judicial officers may not im-
13
pose a financial condition that results in the pretrial 
14
detention of an individual. 
15
(4) In 2017, a report by United States Com-
16
mission on Civil Rights evaluated evidence that— 
17
(A) 47 states increased their fines and fees 
18
in recent years, including fines and fees im-
19
posed on juveniles; 
20
(B) in Virginia, 1 in 6 drivers had license 
21
revoked as a result of an inability to pay court 
22
fines and fees;

(C) in New Jersey, 42 percent of sus-
1
pended drivers lost their jobs as a result of the 
2
suspension; 
3
(D) in the 50 cities with the highest pro-
4
portion of revenues from fines, the median size 
5
of the African-American population in each city 
6
was greater than 5 times the median in the 
7
United States; 
8
(E) in Washington, Latinos received higher 
9
fine assessments than non-Latino Whites for 
10
similar offenses; 
11
(F) 10 counties in California detained ap-
12
proximately 700 people per month for an aver-
13
age of 3 days as a result of a failure to pay and 
14
driving with a suspended license; and 
15
(G) according to the Department of Jus-
16
tice on the investigation of the Ferguson Police 
17
Department, revenue collection, not public safe-
18
ty, was the primary impetus behind the collec-
19
tion of fines and fees. 
20
(5) There is no clear evidence that fines and 
21
fees are an effective crime deterrent. 
22
(6) Defendants released from custody with no 
23
financial penalty return to court at the same rate as 
24
defendants released on financial bond.

•HR 5646 IH
(7) The burden of fines and fees is dispropor-
1
tionately shouldered by low-income communities and 
2
communities of color, which in turn aggravates and 
3
perpetuates poverty and racial inequalities. 
4
(8) Cities with larger Black populations fine 
5
residents more on a per capita basis and are more 
6
reliant on fines. A 1-percent increase in a Black 
7
population is associated with a 5-percent increase in 
8
per capita revenue from fines and a 1-percent in-
9
crease in share of total revenue from fines. 
10
(9) In addition, data on the extent to which in-
11
dividuals are jailed or otherwise penalized because of 
12
their inability to pay fee-only offenses are insuffi-
13
ciently developed, preventing a full picture of the 
14
pervasiveness of targeted fees, as well as the repet-
15
itive impact on individuals from both low-income 
16
communities and communities of color. 
17
(10) Individuals gave up necessities like rent, 
18
food, medical bills, car payments, and child support, 
19
in order to pay down their court debt. 
20
(11) Thirty-eight percent of people surveyed 
21
committed a crime to pay off their court debt. 
22
(12) Driver’s licenses are often suspended auto-
23
matically when cases are transferred to private col-

lectors and are not restored until debts are paid in 
1
full. 
2
(13) Thirty States continue to require payment 
3
of all legal financial obligations before voting rights 
4
are restored, effectively disenfranchising individuals 
5
because of an inability to pay. 
6
(14) Many jurisdictions across the country rely 
7
on fines and fees as a primary revenue source. 
8
(15) A 2019 analysis of fine revenues found 
9
that— 
10
(A) fines are a critical source of funding, 
11
at times accounting for more than half of all 
12
general revenues; 
13
(B) fines and fees account for more than 
14
10 percent of general fund revenues for nearly 
15
600 jurisdictions, and in at least 284 of those, 
16
the share exceeded 20 percent, while another 80 
17
governments reported even higher fines ac-
18
counting for more than half of general reve-
19
nues; 
20
(C) annual revenues exceeding $100 for 
21
every adult resident, while 363 exceeded $200 
22
per adult in all the governments analyzed;

•HR 5646 IH
(D) the States with the highest fines and 
1
fees revenue are Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, 
2
New York, Oklahoma, and Texas; and 
3
(E) jurisdictions where fines and forfeit-
4
ures accounted for more than 20 percent of 
5
general fund revenues recorded a median house-
6
hold income of only $39,594. 
7
(16) The dependency on fines and fees creates 
8
a harmful incentive for courts to levy fines and fees 
9
on indigent individuals regardless of the severity of 
10
the crime. 
11
(17) However, some jurisdiction spent more 
12
than the revenue they raised collecting fees, there-
13
fore losing money through this system. 
14
(18) In some jurisdictions like New Orleans, 
15
the cost of incarcerating individuals unable to pay 
16
fines, fees, and monetary bail exceeded the revenue 
17
generated from those practices. 
18
(19) Some jurisdictions in Texas and New Mex-
19
ico spent 41 cents of every dollar of revenue they 
20
raise from fees and fines on in-court hearings and 
21
jail costs alone. 
22
(20) In almost every State and the District of 
23
Columbia, juvenile courts impose court costs, fines, 
24
and fees on youth, their families, or both. These 
25

costs may increase recidivism, increase the potential 
1
of future jail or prison time, exacerbate racial in-
2
equality, and increase the economic and emotional 
3
distress of low-income families. 
4
(21) Imposing fines and fees on minors and 
5
their families is ineffective as a revenue-generating 
6
measure, often because minors in the criminal jus-
7
tice system come from indigent families. Imposing 
8
these fines and fees increases recidivism and eco-
9
nomic and emotional hardship on families. 
10
(b) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act is to create 
11
a grant program to provide technical assistance and train-
12
ing to State and local courts to— 
13
(1) improve the constitutional and equitable en-
14
forcement of fines and fees; 
15
(2) improve practices regarding the use of fines 
16
and fees and their equitable enforcement when used; 
17
and 
18
(3) collect data to better understand the re-
19
search and best practices of State and local courts
