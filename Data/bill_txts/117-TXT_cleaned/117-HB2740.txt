7
(1) American Indians and Alaska Natives are 
8
2.5 times more likely to experience violent crimes

and at least 2 times more likely to experience rape 
1
or sexual assault crimes than people who are not 
2
American Indians or Alaskan Natives. 
3
(2) The vast majority of American Indian and 
4
Alaska Native victims, 96 percent of female and 89 
5
percent of male victims, report being victimized by 
6
a non-Indian. 
7
(3) According to a 2010 Government Account-
8
ability Office report, the Offices of the United States 
9
Attorneys declined to prosecute nearly 52 percent of 
10
violent crimes that occur in Indian country. 
11
(4) More than 4 in 5 American Indian and 
12
Alaska Native women have experienced violence in 
13
their lifetime. 
14
(5) According to the Centers for Disease Con-
15
trol and Prevention, homicide is the third leading 
16
cause of death among American Indian and Alaska 
17
Native women between 10 and 24 years of age and 
18
the fifth leading cause of death for American Indian 
19
and Alaska Native women between 25 and 34 years 
20
of age. 
21
(6) On some reservations, American Indian 
22
women are murdered at more than 10 times the na-
23
tional average.

•HR 2740 IH
(7) Tribal prosecutors report that the majority 
1
of domestic violence cases involve children either as 
2
witnesses or victims, and the Department of Justice 
3
reports that American Indian and Alaska Native 
4
children suffer exposure to violence at some of the 
5
highest rates in the United States. 
6
(8) Childhood exposure to violence has imme-
7
diate and long-term effects, including increased rates 
8
of altered neurological development, poor physical 
9
and mental health, poor school performance, sub-
10
stance abuse, and overrepresentation in the juvenile 
11
justice system. 
12
(9) Violence against children and crimes associ-
13
ated with dating violence and domestic violence in-
14
crease the number of instances of trauma in Tribal 
15
communities, which— 
16
(A) affects health outcomes; 
17
(B) reduces educational attainment; 
18
(C) hinders economic growth; and 
19
(D) undermines public safety. 
20
(10) Domestic violence calls are among the 
21
most dangerous calls that law enforcement receives, 
22
and the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Uniform 
23
Crime Report shows that police officers, including 
24
Tribal police officers, are assaulted when responding 
25

to disturbance calls more often than under any other 
1
circumstances. 
2
(11) The complicated jurisdictional structure in 
3
Indian country— 
4
(A) requires a high degree of commitment 
5
and cooperation among Tribal, Federal, and 
6
State law enforcement officials; and 
7
(B) when that cooperation breaks down, 
8
results in a significant negative impact on the 
9
ability to provide public safety to Indian com-
10
munities. 
11
(12) The Indian Law and Order Commission, 
12
established by Congress to review Federal criminal 
13
justice policies and practices in Indian country, 
14
issued a report in 2013 entitled ‘‘A Roadmap for 
15
Making Native America Safer’’ that recommends the 
16
restoration of the inherent authority of Tribal 
17
courts. 
18
(13) Restoring and enhancing local, Tribal ca-
19
pacity to address violent crimes provides for greater 
20
local control, safety, accountability, and trans-
21
parency. 
22
(14) Tribal communities should be able to pro-
23
tect themselves from dating violence, domestic vio-
