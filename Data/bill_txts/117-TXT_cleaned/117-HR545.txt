ership to end preventable maternal deaths in the United 
States and globally. 
Whereas Bump Day, an annual global social media campaign

while raising awareness about the urgent need for better, 
more accessible, more respectful, and more responsive 
maternal health care, promotes healthy pregnancies, safe

Whereas 1 in 5 deliveries globally happens without any med-
ical help; 
Whereas pregnant women who do not receive prenatal care 
during pregnancy in the United States are 3 to 4 times 
more likely to die from pregnancy-related complications; 
Whereas 80 percent of all maternal deaths worldwide are pre-
ventable, as are 2⁄3 of maternal deaths in the United 
States; 
Whereas women in the United States are more likely to die 
from childbirth or pregnancy-related complications than 
women in all other developed countries, and the United 
States is the only developed nation in the world where 
maternal mortality is currently increasing; 
Whereas Black and American Indian/Alaska Native women in 
the United States are 2 to 4 times more likely to die 
from pregnancy-related causes compared to White 
women, and furthermore, more than 50,000 women a 
year in the United States experience life-threatening 
pregnancy complications; 
Whereas risks to moms in the United States and globally 
have risen even higher due to widening gaps in maternal 
health care during the COVID–19 pandemic, as well as 
due to serious pregnancy risks associated with maternal 
COVID–19 infection; 
Whereas proper preconception management of chronic condi-
tions such as diabetes, hypertension, and periodontal dis-
ease can reduce the risk of serious pregnancy complica-
tions for both a mom and her baby; 
Whereas intimate partner violence (IPV) is a leading cause 
of maternal death, and women are more likely to experi-

ence IPV during pregnancy than at any other time in 
their lives; 
Whereas IPV during pregnancy and postpartum crosses every 
demographic and has been exacerbated by the COVID– 
19 pandemic; 
Whereas doula support has been shown to improve preg-
nancy, birth, and postpartum outcomes, lower pregnancy- 
and childbirth-related costs by lowering rates of cesarean 
birth, epidural anesthesia, and other interventions, and 
reduce the impact of racial bias on pregnant and 
postpartum women of color; 
Whereas 1 in 7 women in the United States experience 
perinatal mood and anxiety disorders (PMAD) and un-
treated PMADs cost the United States $14.2 billion an-
nually; 
Whereas incarcerated pregnant and postpartum women face 
heightened risks for maternal mortality and complica-
tions, as well as maternal mood disorders, and should be 
provided the highest standard of care; 
Whereas the rate of maternal mortality and morbidity in 
rural and other underserved areas is disproportionately 
high due to challenges in accessing the comprehensive, af-
fordable, quality maternal health care that all moms de-
serve; 
Whereas every mom deserves the respectful, responsive care 
and support she needs to deliver a safe pregnancy, 
healthy birth, and healthy future to herself and her baby; 
and 
Whereas Wednesday, July 21, 2021, and all subsequent third 
Wednesdays in July would be an appropriate annual day
