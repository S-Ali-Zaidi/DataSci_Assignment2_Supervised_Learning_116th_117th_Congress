SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Environmental Justice 
2
Mapping and Data Collection Act of 2021’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds that— 
5
(1) environmental hazards causing adverse 
6
health outcomes have disproportionately affected en-
7
vironmental justice communities as a result of sys-
8
temic injustices relating to factors that include race 
9
and income; 
10
(2) environmental justice communities have in-
11
creased vulnerability to the adverse effects of climate 
12
change and need significant investment to face cur-
13
rent and future environmental hazards; 
14
(3) the Federal Government has lacked a cohe-
15
sive and consistent strategy to carry out the respon-
16
sibilities of Federal agencies described in Executive 
17
Order 12898 (42 U.S.C. 4321 note; relating to Fed-
18
eral actions to address environmental justice in mi-
19
nority populations and low-income populations); 
20
(4) it is necessary that the Federal Government 
21
meaningfully engage environmental justice commu-
22
nities in the process of developing a robust strategy 
23
to address environmental justice, including high lev-
24
els of review, input, and consent; 
25
02:36 Feb 18, 2021
H516

•HR 516 IH
(5) there is a lack of nationwide high-quality 
1
data relating to environmental justice concerns, such 
2
as socioeconomic factors, air pollution, water pollu-
3
tion, soil pollution, and public health, and a failure 
4
to update the existing data with adequate frequency; 
5
(6) there is no nationally consistent method to 
6
identify environmental justice communities based on 
7
the cumulative effects of socioeconomic factors, pol-
8
lution burden, and public health; 
9
(7) a method described in paragraph (6) is 
10
needed to correct for racist and unjust practices 
11
leading to historical and current environmental in-
12
justices through the targeted investment in environ-
13
mental justice communities of at least 40 percent of 
14
the funds provided for a clean energy transition and 
15
other related investments, including transportation 
16
infrastructure, housing infrastructure, and water 
17
quality infrastructure; 
18
(8) funds targeted for environmental justice 
19
communities should include set-asides for technical 
20
assistance and capacity building for environmental 
21
justice communities to access the funds; 
22
(9) particular oversight and care are necessary 
23
when investing in environmental justice communities 
24
to ensure that existing issues are not exacerbated 
25
02:36 Feb 18, 2021
H516

•HR 516 IH
and new issues are not created, particularly issues 
1
relating to pollution burden and the displacement of 
2
residents; 
3
(10) several States, academic institutions, and 
4
nonprofit organizations have engaged in cumulative 
5
impact environmental justice mapping efforts that 
6
can serve as references for a Federal mapping effort; 
7
(11) many environmental justice communities, 
8
such as communities in ‘‘Cancer Alley’’ in the State 
9
of Louisiana, have been clearly affected by extreme 
10
environmental hazards such that the communities— 
11
(A) are identifiable before the establish-
12
ment of the tool under subsection (b) of section 
13
5 and the completion of the data gap audit 
14
under subsection (d) of that section; and 
15
(B) should be eligible for programs tar-
16
geted toward environmental justice communities 
17
that have faced extreme environmental hazards 
18
before the establishment of that tool and the 
19
completion of that audit; 
20
(12) in addition to investment in environmental 
21
justice communities, pollution reduction is essential 
22
to achieving equitable access to a healthy and clean 
23
environment and an equitable energy system; and 
24
02:36 Feb 18, 2021
H516
5 
•HR 516 IH
(13) specific policy and permitting decisions 
1
and investments may rely on different combinations 
2
of data sets and indicators relating to environmental 
3
justice, and race alone may be considered a criterion 
4
when assessing the susceptibility of a community to 
5
environmental injustice.
