ing the patient medication information required to be 
included in the labeling of prescription drugs, and for 
other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

4
Know Their Medication Act of 2022’’.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 6519 IH
(1) Prescription medications are important to 
1
the health and well-being of the American public. 
2
(2) According to the Centers for Disease Con-
3
trol and Prevention (CDC), 48.9 percent of Ameri-
4
cans used at least one prescription drug in the past 
5
30 days. 
6
(3) The utilization of prescription drugs can 
7
subject patients to adverse drug events; therefore, 
8
patient safety is of the utmost importance. 
9
(4) Studies indicate that paper format patient 
10
medication information (PMI) can help protect pa-
11
tients and prevent the majority of costly adverse 
12
drug events. 
13
(5) In addition to bolstering patient safety, the 
14
mandatory use of a standardized PMI provided to 
15
all patients in nonhospital settings could reduce 
16
costs associated with emergency room visits and hos-
17
pital admissions related to adverse drug events by 
18
$14.6 to $26.2 billion dollars annually. 
19
(6) Many patients cannot access electronic 
20
versions of PMI, thereby necessitating a paper op-
21
tion. 
22
(7) The Government Accountability Office 
23
found that relying on electronic labeling as a com-
24

•HR 6519 IH
plete substitute for paper labeling could adversely 
1
impact public health. 
2
(8) A congressionally mandated paper PMI is 
3
needed because no standardized PMI in a single 
4
page, paper copy, proven patient-friendly format is 
5
currently available to patients or required by the 
6
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 
7
301 et seq.).
