THORIZATION ACT OF 1989.

The Apex Project, Nevada Land Transfer and Au-
3
thorization Act of 1989 (Public Law 101–67; 103 Stat. 
4
168) is amended— 
5

6
following: 
7
‘‘(9) Nevada’s ‘boom and bust’ economic 
8
timeline demonstrates a need for economic diversity 
9
and stability in the Las Vegas Valley. In the year 
10
2000, Nevada was the fastest growing State for 14 
11
consecutive years and had increased its population 
12
by 1,000,000 residents since 1980. During the reces-
13
sion and mortgage crisis in 2009, Nevada was one 
14
of the hardest hit States, with its population facing 
15
a 20 percent increase in economic insecurity. Over 
16
the following decade, the Las Vegas Valley rebuilt, 
17
and by 2020, Nevada led in growth nationally. How-
18
ever, in 2021, the State experienced economic hard-
19
ship at higher rates due to the impact of the 
20
COVID–19 pandemic on the travel and tourism in-
21
dustries. 
22
‘‘(10) The Apex Project has expanded to be one 
23
of the most promising economic endeavors in South-
24
ern Nevada, with the potential to create jobs, stimu-
25
late wages, and improve the well-being of everyone

1
Vegas, the only predominantly minority population, 
2
which has been hit particularly hard by recessions 
3
and the COVID–19 pandemic.

‘‘(11) The Apex Project has evolved since 1989, 
5
but the partnership between Federal and private 
6
land owners remains unwavering. The Bureau of 
7
Land Management and Apex stakeholders have cre-
8
ated important environmental protections and per-
9
mitting procedures that are appropriate to utilize in 
10
a streamlined capacity as the Apex Project continues 
11
to take a new direction.’’;

(A) by redesignating paragraph (6) as 
14
paragraph (8); and
