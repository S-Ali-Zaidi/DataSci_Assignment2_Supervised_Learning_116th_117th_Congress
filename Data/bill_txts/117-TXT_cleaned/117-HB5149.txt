Congress finds the following:

•HR 5149 IH
(1) According to the Bureau of Health Work-
1
force, the United States faces a shortage of physi-
2
cians. 
3
(2) A 2020 report released by the Association 
4
of American Medical Colleges projects shortages in 
5
all surgical specialties of between 17,100 and 28,700 
6
surgeons by 2033. 
7
(3) A 2020 report prepared by the Health Re-
8
sources and Services Administration for the Com-
9
mittee on Appropriations of the Senate found a 
10
‘‘maldistribution of general surgeons’’ nationwide, 
11
with only enough general surgeons to meet 69 per-
12
cent of the demand for care in rural areas and 75 
13
percent of the demand for care in suburban areas. 
14
(4) The 2020 report prepared by the Health 
15
Resources and Services Administration also found 
16
that although the supply of general surgeons is pro-
17
jected to increase slightly by 2030, rural and subur-
18
ban areas will still not have enough general surgeons 
19
to meet the demand for care in those areas. 
20
(5) In order to accurately prepare for future 
21
physician workforce demands, comprehensive, impar-
22
tial research and high-quality data are needed to in-
23
form dynamic projections of physician workforce 
24
needs.

•HR 5149 IH
(6) A variety of factors, including health out-
1
comes, utilization trends, growing and aging popu-
2
lations, and delivery system changes, influence work-
3
force needs and should be considered as part of 
4
flexible projections of workforce needs. 
5
(7) Given the particularly acute needs in many 
6
rural and other surgical workforce shortage areas, 
7
additional efforts to assess the adequacy of the cur-
8
rent general surgeon workforce are necessary.

10
HEALTH PROFESSIONAL SHORTAGE AREAS.

Part D of title III of the Public Health Service Act 
12
(42 U.S.C. 254b et seq.) is amended by adding at the end 
13
the following:

16
AGE AREAS.

‘‘(a) GENERAL SURGERY SHORTAGE AREA DE-

suburban, or rural area in the United States, an area that 
21
has a population that is underserved by general surgeons.

ices Administration, shall conduct a study on the fol-
1
lowing matters relating to access by underserved 
2
populations to general surgeons: 
3
‘‘(A) Whether current shortage designa-
4
tions, such as the designation of health profes-
5
sional shortage areas under section 332, results 
6
in accurate assessments of the adequacy of local 
7
general surgeons to address the needs of under-
8
served populations in urban, suburban, or rural 
9
areas. 
10
‘‘(B) Whether another measure of access 
11
to general surgeons by underserved populations, 
12
such as one based on general surgeons prac-
13
ticing within hospital service areas, would pro-
14
vide more accurate assessments of shortages in 
15
the availability of local general surgeons to 
16
meet the needs of those populations.

18
ignation of general surgery shortage areas, in-
