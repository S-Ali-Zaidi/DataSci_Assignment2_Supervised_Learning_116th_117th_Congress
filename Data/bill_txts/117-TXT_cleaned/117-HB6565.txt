A BILL 
To establish an alternative use of certain Federal education 
funds when in-person instruction is not available. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Kids in Classes Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
5
Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) Research indicates that children living in 
7
the poorest 20 percent of neighborhoods in the

United States will experience the most negative and 
1
long-lasting effects of school closures. 
2
(2) Researchers predict that 1 year of school 
3
closures will cost ninth graders in the poorest com-
4
munities a 25-percent decrease in their post-edu-
5
cational earning potential, even if that year of clo-
6
sure is followed by 3 years of normal schooling. By 
7
contrast, the same researchers predict no substantial 
8
losses for students from the richest 20 percent of 
9
neighborhoods. 
10
(3) Long periods of school closures during the 
11
COVID–19 pandemic deprive low-income students 
12
and students of color the equalizing force of edu-
13
cation. 
14
(4) School closures will widen educational in-
15
equality and the learning gaps created by these clo-
16
sures will persist as students progress through high 
17
school, putting their future prospects at risk. 
18
(5) Data shows that closed classrooms were dis-
19
proportionately composed of disadvantaged students, 
20
as well as students with low mathematics scores, 
21
students with limited English proficiency, or stu-
22
dents who qualify for a free or reduced priced lunch.

(6) School shutdowns contribute to dispropor-
1
tionate learning loss for disadvantaged students, 
2
compounding existing gaps.

SEC. 3. USE OF TITLE I FUNDS IF IN-PERSON INSTRUCTION 
4
IS NOT AVAILABLE.

(a) TITLE I FUNDS TO FOLLOW ELIGIBLE CHIL-
6
DREN.—Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a 
7
State educational agency shall not receive grant funds pro-
8
vided under title I of the Elementary and Secondary Edu-

10

11
rectly to the parent or guardian of an eligible child for 
12
qualified educational expenses (including curriculum and 
13
curricular materials, books or instructional materials, 
14

15
materials, tutoring or educational classes outside the 
16
