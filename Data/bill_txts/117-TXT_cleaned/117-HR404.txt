RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the designation of the 17th day in 
May as ‘‘DIPG Awareness Day’’ to raise awareness and 
encourage research into cures for diffuse intrinsic 
pontine glioma (DIPG) and pediatric cancers in general. 
Whereas diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) affects 200 
to 400 children in the United States each year with cer-
tain regularity; 
Whereas brain tumors are the leading cause of cancer-related 
death in children;

Whereas DIPG is the second most common malignant brain 
tumor of childhood; 
Whereas DIPG is the leading cause of childhood death due 
to brain tumors; 
Whereas the median survival time is only 9 months 
postdiagnosis with treatment; 
Whereas 5-year survival is less than 1 percent; 
Whereas, given the age at diagnosis and the average life ex-
pectancy, the number of life years lost annually because 
of DIPG is approximately 24,000 years of person life lost 
(calculated as the number of children diagnosed by aver-
age of male and female life expectancy from that median 
age, 300 × 80 = 24,000 years of person life lost annu-
ally); 
Whereas prognosis has not improved for children with DIPG 
in over 40 years; and 
Whereas Federal funding for research for pediatric cancer 
should be increased to address the level of unmet medical 
need for this vulnerable population: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the designation of ‘‘DIPG Aware-
2
ness Day’’; 
3
(2) encourages all people of the United States 
4
to become more informed about diffuse intrinsic 
5
pontine glioma (DIPG) pediatric brain cancer, and 
6
the current challenges to the medical research sys-
7
tem in designating sufficient research funding for 
8
pediatric cancers;

(3) supports expanded research to better under-

stand DIPG, develop effective treatments, and pro-
2
vide comprehensive care for children with DIPG and

their families; and

(4) encourages public and private sources of re-

search funding to elevate their consideration of the

mortality rate of a type of cancer, as well as the life- 
7
years lost, as significant factors to be considered

during the grant application process.
