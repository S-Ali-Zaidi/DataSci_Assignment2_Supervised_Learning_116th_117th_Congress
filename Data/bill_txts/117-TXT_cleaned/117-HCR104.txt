CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 
Recognizing September 11, 2022, as a ‘‘National Day of 
Service and Remembrance’’. 
Whereas, on September 11, 2001, the United States endured 
violent terrorist attacks and events (referred to in this 
preamble as the ‘‘attacks’’) in New York City, Wash-
ington, DC, and Shanksville, Pennsylvania, leading to the 
tragic deaths and injuries of thousands of innocent 
United States citizens and others from more than 90 dif-
ferent countries and territories; 
Whereas, in response to the attacks, firefighters, uniformed

mediately rose to service in the heroic attempt to save the 
lives of the individuals in danger; 
Whereas, in the immediate aftermath of the attacks, thou-
sands of recovery workers, including trades personnel, 
iron workers, equipment operators, and many others, 
joined with uniformed officers and military personnel to 
help search for and recover victims lost in the attacks; 
Whereas, in the days, weeks, and months following the at-
tacks, thousands of individuals in the United States 
spontaneously volunteered to help support rescue and re-
covery efforts, braving both physical and emotional hard-
ship; 
Whereas many first responders, rescue and recovery workers, 
volunteers, and survivors of the attacks continue to suffer 
from serious medical illnesses and emotional distress re-
lated to the physical and mental trauma of the attacks; 
Whereas hundreds of thousands of brave individuals continue 
to serve every day, answering the call to duty as members 
of the Armed Forces, with many having given their lives 
or suffered injury— 
(1) to defend the security of the United States; and 
(2) to prevent further terrorist attacks; 
Whereas the people of the United States witnessed and en-
dured the tragedy of September 11, 2001, and, in the im-
mediate aftermath of the attacks, came together under a 
remarkable and inspiring spirit of unity, service, and 
compassion; 
Whereas, in the years immediately following the attacks, 
there was a marked increase in volunteerism and national 
service among the people of the United States, which 
continues to this day;

Whereas, in 2009, with the support of members of the com-
munity affected by the attacks, Congress passed, and 
President Barack Obama signed, the bipartisan Serve 
America Act (Public Law 111–13; 123 Stat. 1460), 
which— 
(1) established Federal recognition of September 11 
as a ‘‘National Day of Service and Remembrance’’ (com-
monly referred to as ‘‘9/11 Day’’) as a way to annually 
and forever encourage all people of the United States to 
remember and pay tribute on the anniversary of the at-
tacks through acts of service, including volunteerism, and 
to keep the promise to ‘‘Never Forget’’; and 
(2) charged the Corporation for National and Com-
munity Service (commonly known as ‘‘AmeriCorps’’), the 
Federal agency for community service and volunteerism, 
with leading the annual day of service; and 
Whereas, since the establishment of September 11 as a Na-
tional Day of Service and Remembrance, millions of indi-
viduals in the United States have observed that date by 
uniting together across differences and engaging in a 
wide range of service activities and private forms of pray-
er and remembrance: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate 
1
concurring), That Congress—

(1) recognizes, commends, and honors the self-

less dedication to fellow citizens displayed through 
4
the heroic actions of first responders and other citi-
5
zens in New York City, Washington, DC, and
