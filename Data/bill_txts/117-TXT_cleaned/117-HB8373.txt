13
SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
14
Congress finds the following: 
15
(1) The right to contraception is a fundamental 
16
right, central to a person’s privacy, health, 
17
wellbeing, dignity, liberty, equality, and ability to 
18
participate in the social and economic life of the Na-
19
tion. 
20
(2) The Supreme Court has repeatedly recog-
21
nized the constitutional right to contraception. 
22
(3) In Griswold v. Connecticut (381 U.S. 479 
23
(1965)), the Supreme Court first recognized the con-
24
4 
•HR 8373 EH
stitutional right for married people to use contracep-
1
tives. 
2
(4) In Eisenstadt v. Baird (405 U.S. 438 
3
(1972)), the Supreme Court confirmed the constitu-
4
tional right of all people to legally access contracep-
5
tives regardless of marital status. 
6
(5) In Carey v. Population Services Inter-
7
national (431 U.S. 678 (1977)), the Supreme Court 
8
affirmed the constitutional right to contraceptives 
9
for minors. 
10
(6) The right to contraception has been repeat-
11
edly recognized internationally as a human right. 
12
The United Nations Population Fund has published 
13
several reports outlining family planning as a basic 
14
human right that advances women’s health, eco-
15
nomic empowerment, and equality. 
16
(7) Access to contraceptives is internationally 
17
recognized by the World Health Organization as ad-
18
vancing other human rights such as the right to life, 
19
liberty, expression, health, work, and education. 
20
(8) Contraception is safe, essential health care, 
21
and access to contraceptive products and services is 
22
central to people’s ability to participate equally in 
23
economic and social life in the United States and 
24
5 
•HR 8373 EH
globally. Contraception allows people to make deci-
1
sions about their families and their lives. 
2
(9) Contraception is key to sexual and repro-
3
ductive health. Contraception is critical to pre-
4
venting unintended pregnancy and many contracep-
5
tives are highly effective in preventing and treating 
6
a wide array of often severe medical conditions and 
7
decrease the risk of certain cancers. 
8
(10) Family planning improves health outcomes 
9
for women, their families, and their communities 
10
and reduces rates of maternal and infant mortality 
11
and morbidity. 
12
(11) The United States has a long history of 
13
reproductive coercion, including the childbearing 
14
forced upon enslaved women, as well as the forced 
15
sterilization of Black women, Puerto Rican women, 
16
indigenous women, immigrant women, and disabled 
17
women, and reproductive coercion continues to 
18
occur. 
19
(12) The right to make personal decisions about 
20
contraceptive use is important for all Americans, 
21
and is especially critical for historically marginalized 
22
groups, including Black, indigenous, and other peo-
23
ple of color; immigrants; LGBTQ people; people with 
24
disabilities; people with low incomes; and people liv-
25
6 
•HR 8373 EH
ing in rural and underserved areas. Many people 
1
who are part of these marginalized groups already 
2
face barriers—exacerbated by social, political, eco-
3
nomic, and environmental inequities—to comprehen-
4
sive health care, including reproductive health care, 
5
that reduce their ability to make decisions about 
6
their health, families, and lives. 
7
(13) State and Federal policies governing phar-
8
maceutical and insurance policies affect the accessi-
9
bility of contraceptives, and the settings in which 
10
contraception services are delivered. 
11
(14) People engage in interstate commerce to 
12
access contraception services. 
13
(15) To provide contraception services, health 
14
care providers employ and obtain commercial serv-
15
ices from doctors, nurses, and other personnel who 
16
engage in interstate commerce and travel across 
17
State lines. 
18
(16) Congress has the authority to enact this 
19
Act to protect access to contraception pursuant to— 
20
(A) its powers under the Commerce Clause 
21
of section 8 of article I of the Constitution of 
22
the United States; 
23
(B) its powers under section 5 of the Four-
24
teenth Amendment to the Constitution of the 
25
7 
•HR 8373 EH
United States to enforce the provisions of sec-
1
tion 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment; and 
2
(C) its powers under the necessary and 
3
proper clause of section 8 of article I of the 
4
Constitution of the United States. 
5
(17) Congress has used its authority in the past 
6
to protect and expand access to contraception infor-
7
mation, products, and services. 
8
(18) In 1970, Congress established the family 
9
planning program under title X of the Public Health 
10
Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300 et seq.), the only Fed-
11
eral grant program dedicated to family planning and 
12
related services, providing access to information, 
13
products, and services for contraception. 
14
(19) In 1972, Congress required the Medicaid 
15
program to cover family planning services and sup-
16
plies, and the Medicaid program currently accounts 
17
for 75 percent of Federal funds spent on family 
18
planning. 
19
(20) In 2010, Congress enacted the Patient 
20
Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law 
21
111–148) (referred to in this section as the ‘‘ACA’’). 
22
Among other provisions, the ACA included provi-
23
sions to expand the affordability and accessibility of 
24
contraception by requiring health insurance plans to 
25
8 
•HR 8373 EH
provide coverage for preventive services with no pa-
1
tient cost-sharing. 
2
(21) Despite the clearly established constitu-
3
tional right to contraception, access to contracep-
4
tives, including emergency contraceptives and long- 
5
acting reversible contraceptives, has been obstructed 
6
across the United States in various ways by Federal 
7
and State governments. 
8
(22) As of 2022, at least 4 States tried to ban 
9
access to some or all contraceptives by restricting 
10
access to public funding for these products and serv-
11
ices. Furthermore, Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri, 
12
and Texas have infringed on people’s ability to ac-
13
cess their contraceptive care by violating the free 
14
choice of provider requirement under the Medicaid 
15
program. 
16
(23) Providers’ refusals to offer contraceptives 
17
and information related to contraception based on 
18
their own personal beliefs impede patients from ob-
19
taining their preferred method, with laws in 12 
20
States as of the date of introduction of this Act spe-
21
cifically allowing health care providers to refuse to 
22
provide services related to contraception. 
23
(24) States have attempted to define abortion 
24
expansively so as to include contraceptives in State 
25
9 
•HR 8373 EH
bans on abortion and have also restricted access to 
1
emergency contraception. 
2
(25) In June 2022, Justice Thomas, in his con-
3
curring opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s 
4
Health Organization (597 U.S. ll (2022)), stated 
5
that the Supreme Court ‘‘should reconsider all of 
6
this Court’s substantive due process precedents, in-
7
cluding Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell’’ and 
8
that the Court has ‘‘a duty to correct the error es-
9
tablished in those precedents’’ by overruling them. 
10
(26) In order to further public health and to 
11
combat efforts to restrict access to reproductive 
12
health care, congressional action is necessary to pro-
13
tect access to contraceptives, contraception, and in-
14
formation related to contraception for everyone, re-
15
gardless of actual or perceived race, ethnicity, sex 
16
(including gender identity and sexual orientation), 
17
income, disability, national origin, immigration sta-
18
tus, or geography.
