RESOLUTION 
Recognizing August 2, National Night Out, the national com-
ing together of Americans all over the Nation to unite 
and promote public safety. 
Whereas on the first Tuesday of August, the Nation will ob-
serve National Night Out, a day to cultivate a better re-
lationship between residents of a community and their 
local law enforcement, and to promote public safety; 
Whereas the participation in National Night Out by over 
38,000,000 neighbors in over 16,000 communities across 
the United States for over 38 years is inspiring; 
Whereas the relationship between local law enforcement and 
the residents which they are sworn to protect is impor-
tant in creating a true sense of community;

Whereas general awareness of public safety has improved, be-
cause of the continued efforts of communities to meet 
their law enforcement officers and participate in National

tories and military bases to ensure all are included in the 
effort of community building and public safety awareness:

2
use National Night Out to improve relationships 
3
with the communities they serve;

(2) encourages public safety departments to in-
5
form communities— 
6
(A) how to most effectively contact their 
7
911 responders and emergency service pro-

10
(3) recognizes the impact that has been made 
11
for over 38 years in communities all over the United
