RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the designation of February 7 to 
13, 2021, as ‘‘National Burn Awareness Week’’. 
Whereas burn injuries continue to be one of the leading 
causes of accidental death and injury in our Nation 
where, tragically, children, the elderly, and the disabled 
are especially vulnerable to burn injuries, and almost one- 
third of all burn injuries occur in children under the age 
of 15; 
Whereas, annually, in the United States, approximately 
400,000 people receive medical care for treatment of 
burn injuries; 
Whereas, in 2018 alone, there were 3,655 deaths from fire 
and smoke inhalation and another 40,000 people were 
treated in hospitals for burn-related injuries;

Whereas compared to the overall population, children under 
5 were 2 times as likely to be seen for burn injuries at 
a hospital emergency department; 
Whereas young adults in the 20 to 29 age group had 1.4 
times the risk, and those in the 30 to 39 age group had 
1.3 times the risk of the general population; 
Whereas the primary causes of injury include fire-flame, 
scalds, contact with hot objects, electrical, and chemicals, 
and most of the injuries occur in the home; 
Whereas, today, 96.8 percent of those who suffer burn inju-
ries will survive, but, unfortunately, many of those sur-
vivors will sustain serious scarring, life-long physical dis-
abilities, and adjustment difficulties; 
Whereas ‘‘National Burn Awareness Week’’, an initiative of 
the American Burn Association, is a coming together of 
burn, fire, and life safety educators to make the public 
aware of the frequency, devastation, and causes of burn 
injury as well as consistent and authoritative measures to 
prevent these injuries and how to best care for those that 
are injured; 
Whereas the theme for 2021 National Burn Awareness Week 
is ‘‘Electrical Safety from Amps to Zap!’’, where a com-
mon risk of injury exists from unprotected electrical out-
lets, improperly used extension cords, lightning, and 
workplace electrical injuries; 
Whereas significant research and medical advances have dra-
matically improved burn care and treatment, aided reha-
bilitation, shortened hospital stays, and increased burn 
survival rates; 
Whereas aftercare support for the physical and emotional ef-
fects of burns has played a key role in the successful re-

integration of burn survivors into our communities and 
burn safety education and prevention efforts continue to 
reduce the number of people who suffer burns each year; 
Whereas many people devote their lives and careers to treat-
ing, caring for, supporting, and rehabilitating burn injury 
survivors, including those performing vital work in burn 
research and development; and 
Whereas there are dedicated firefighters who risk their own 
lives every day to protect others, as well as burn founda-
tions and other life safety professionals who promote 
burn injury awareness and prevention: Now, therefore, be 
it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the designation of a ‘‘National 
2
Burn Awareness Week’’; and 
3
(2) calls upon all government agencies, fire, life 
4
safety, health care organizations, communications 
5
media, and the people of our Nation to observe ‘‘Na-
6
tional Burn Awareness Week’’ with the appropriate 
7
ceremonies and activities.
