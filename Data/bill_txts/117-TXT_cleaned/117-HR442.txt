Whereas 241 members of the Armed Forces lost their lives 
in the blast; 
Whereas the attack killed 220 marines, members of the 1st

Whereas October 23, 1983, was the deadliest day for the Ma-

Whereas, in addition to the Marine Corps casualties, 18 Navy 
sailors and 3 Army soldiers were killed, and more than

a separate tragic suicide bombing on April 18, 1983, that 
killed 63 people, including 17 Americans, and injured 
120 others in front of the United States Embassy in Bei-
rut; and 
Whereas it is fitting and proper that the events of October 
23, 1983, and the members of the United States Armed 
Forces who died in Beirut on that day are recognized and 
commemorated through the establishment of a national 
day of remembrance on October 23: Now, therefore, be
