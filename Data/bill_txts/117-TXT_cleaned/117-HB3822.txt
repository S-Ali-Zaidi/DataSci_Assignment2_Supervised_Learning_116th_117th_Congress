(b) TABLE OF CONTENTS.—The table of contents for

this Act is as follows: 
2
Sec. 1. Short title; table of contents. 
Sec. 2. Findings; sense of Congress. 
Sec. 3. States prohibited from imposing asset limits on programs funded by 
Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) grants. 
Sec. 4. Eliminating asset limits in the supplemental nutrition assistance pro-
gram (SNAP). 
Sec. 5. Eliminating asset limit in Low Income Home Energy Assistance Pro-
gram (LIHEAP). 
Sec. 6. Updating and indexing the resource limit for supplemental security in-
come (SSI). 
Sec. 7. Effective date. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
3
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds as follows: 
4
(1) Many means-tested public assistance pro-
5
grams limit eligibility for benefits on the basis of the 
6
assets of a family, such as savings and other re-
7
sources. Such asset limits impede the ability of 
8
needy families to improve their financial cir-
9
cumstances and thereby reduce their dependence on 
10
public assistance programs. 
11
(2) Restricting eligibility for public assistance 
12
programs on the basis of assets negatively affects 
13
the financial security of low-income families. For ex-
14
ample, to avoid losing eligibility for public assistance 
15
under an asset limit, a family may avoid mainstream 
16
financial services such as bank accounts, or refrain 
17
from acquiring and saving resources that would en-
18
able the family to weather an unanticipated expense.

•HR 3822 IH
(3) The risk that people who don’t need public 
1
assistance will take advantage of public assistance 
2
programs in the absence of asset limits is low, in 
3
part because most applicants for public assistance 
4
have very few assets, must meet strict work require-
5
ments, and usually may only participate in a pro-
6
gram for a limited time. 
7
(4) Evidence from States that have eliminated 
8
asset limits suggests that the administrative cost 
9
savings associated with the elimination of asset lim-
10
its outweigh any increases in payments made to 
11
beneficiaries. 
12
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
13
gress that certain federally funded means-tested public as-
14
sistance programs should not utilize asset limits to restrict 
15
eligibility for assistance under those programs.
