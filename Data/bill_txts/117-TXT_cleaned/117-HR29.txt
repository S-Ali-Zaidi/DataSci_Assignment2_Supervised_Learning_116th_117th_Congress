Whereas there is a broad consensus among climate scientists 
that the human activities contributing to increases in 
greenhouse gas emissions are the dominant cause of cli-
mate change; 
Whereas, to meaningfully act upon our changing climate and 
changed world, young people need education about its 
causes, consequences, anticipated future impacts, and 
possible solutions; 
Whereas climate change is a social justice, racial justice, and 
human rights issue; 
Whereas, according to the National Center for Science Edu-
cation, 37 States and the District of Columbia recognize 
human-caused climate change in their science education 
standards; 
Whereas the National Science Teaching Association, the Na-
tional Association of Geoscience Teachers, the National 
Association of Biology Teachers, and other professional 
organizations have called for greater support for science 
educators in teaching climate science and climate change; 
Whereas, in 2015, the California State PTA declared climate 
change a children’s issue; 
Whereas, in 2019, the California Association of School Psy-
chologists declared climate change a potential threat to 
the psychological and social development of children; 
Whereas climate change is threatening students’ communities

Whereas children represent a particularly vulnerable group 
because greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere 
will continue to accumulate over the coming decades and 
cause negative health outcomes; 
Whereas children are more vulnerable to the effects of cri-
teria air pollutants emitted during the burning of fossil 
fuels; 
Whereas Americans must unify behind addressing climate 
change for the good of this generation and all subsequent 
generations; 
Whereas school districts should explore district-wide sustain-
ability initiatives to educate students and reduce their 
carbon footprint; 
Whereas teaching climate change in schools will help students 
understand the human impact of climate change; 
Whereas teaching climate change in schools will help students 
understand that life on Earth depends on, is shaped by, 
and affects our climate; 
Whereas teaching climate change will help students develop 
energy literacy and may stimulate interest in STEM ca-
reers; 
Whereas teaching climate change will have consequences for 
Earth, human lives, and ecosystems around the world; 
Whereas when students engage in a climate change cur-
riculum, they can develop a greater sense of efficacy with 
respect to their capacity to address critical social and en-
vironmental issues; and 
Whereas the global impact of climate change and the urgency 
and magnitude of the challenge of addressing climate
