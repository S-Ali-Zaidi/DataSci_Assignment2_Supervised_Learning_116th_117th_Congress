A BILL 
To amend the securities laws to exclude investment contract 
assets from the definition of a security. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Securities Clarity Act’’.

SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS; PURPOSE. 
5
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
6
gress that— 
7
(1) among the ways that participants in the 
8
digital asset industry have raised capital and earned 
9
revenue is through arrangements in which investors

provide funds for the development of blockchain- 
1
based protocols in exchange for digital assets or the 
2
future delivery of digital assets to be used in those 
3
protocols; 
4
(2) although certain of those fundraising ar-
5
rangements may be deemed to be ‘‘investment con-
6
tracts’’ within the meaning given to that term in 
7
section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the ‘‘Se-
8
curities Act’’), the underlying assets sold pursuant 
9
to these arrangements are frequently not themselves 
10
inherently securities as defined in section 2(a) of the 
11
Securities Act and, like other assets sold pursuant to 
12
investment contracts in the past, do not become se-
13
curities as so defined merely because they are sold 
14
pursuant to an investment contract; 
15
(3) under SEC v. W.J. Howey Co., 328 U.S. 
16
293 (1946), and its progeny, the Federal courts 
17
have consistently held that ‘‘an investment contract, 
18
for purposes of the Securities Act, means a contract, 
19
transaction, or scheme whereby a person invests his 
20
money in a common enterprise and is led to expect 
21
profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a 
22
third party’’, and have not endorsed the notion that 
23
an asset underlying an investment contract (for ex-
24
ample, the orange groves sold in Howey) is also con-
25

ferred ‘‘security’’ status merely as a result of its 
1
being sold pursuant to the relevant contract, trans-
2
action, or scheme; 
3
(4) although the distinction between an invest-
4
ment contract, which is a security, and the assets 
5
sold pursuant to it had been well-settled for pur-
6
poses of section 2(a) of the Securities Act, the two 
7
have been unnecessarily conflated in the context of 
8
digital assets; and 
9
(5) this new approach, which conflates an in-
10
vestment contract and the asset sold pursuant to 
11
that contract or scheme, differs from the approach 
12
taken in many other major jurisdictions around the 
13
world, has discouraged development of the digital 
14
asset sector in the United States, and has hindered 
15
innovation in that industry here without providing 
16
concomitant benefits to those who enter into invest-
17
ment contracts for the purpose of acquiring digital 
18
assets. 
19
(b) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act is to clarify 
20
and codify that an asset sold pursuant to an investment 
21
contract, whether tangible or intangible (including an 
22
asset in digital form), that is not otherwise a security 
23
under the Act, does not become a security as a result of
