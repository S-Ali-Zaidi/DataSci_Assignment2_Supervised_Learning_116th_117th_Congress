honor the accomplishments of African Americans in every 
area of endeavor throughout the history of the United 
States; 
Whereas the people of the United States honor the 6888th 
Central Postal Directory Battalion (referred to in this 
preamble as the ‘‘6888th’’), which was the first and only 
African-American unit in the Women’s Army Corps to 
deploy overseas during World War II;

ing World War II from February 1945 to February 
1946; 
Whereas First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt encouraged the mili-
tary to provide meaningful positions for Black women to 
serve in the war overseas; 
Whereas during World War II there was a significant short-
age of postal workers across the European Theater; 
Whereas the 6888th was a self-sufficient unit consisting 
mainly of postal clerks, but also cooks, mechanics, and 
other support positions; 
Whereas the 6888th trained at Fort Oglethrope, Georgia, and 
deployed overseas to Birmingham, England, in February 
1945; 
Whereas once the 6888th arrived in Birmingham, they were 
met with rooms full of mail stacked from floor to ceiling, 
dating as far back as 2 years; 
Whereas much of the mail was difficult to sort, often only ad-
dressed to first names or nicknames; 
Whereas the 6888th devised a system to handle the backlog 
and worked in 3 shifts around-the-clock, sorting millions 
of pieces of mail; 
Whereas the project was estimated to take 6 months to com-
plete, but the battalion finished the task in an impressive 
3 months in May 1945; 
Whereas the 6888th went on to Rouen and Paris, France, to 
address other backlogs of mail as old as 3 years, again 
with remarkable speed, accuracy, and professionalism; 
Whereas members of the 6888th were awarded the Meri-
torious Unit Commendation, the European-African-Mid-
dle Eastern Campaign Medal, the Good Conduct Medal,
