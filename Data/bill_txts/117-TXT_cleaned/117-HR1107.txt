RESOLUTION 
Designating the week of May 1, 2022, through May 7, 2022, 
as ‘‘Tardive Dyskinesia Awareness Week’’. 
Whereas many people with serious, chronic mental illness, 
such as schizophrenia and other schizoaffective disorders, 
bipolar disorder, or severe depression, require treatment 
with medications that work as dopamine receptor block-
ing agents (referred to in this preamble as ‘‘DRBAs’’), 
including antipsychotics; 
Whereas, while ongoing treatment with DRBAs can be very 
helpful, and even lifesaving, for many people it can also 
lead to tardive dyskinesia; 
Whereas many people who have gastrointestinal disorders, in-
cluding gastroparesis, nausea, and vomiting, also require 
treatment with DRBAs;

•HRES 1107 IH 
Whereas treatment of gastrointestinal disorders with DRBAs 
can be very helpful, but for many patients can lead to 
tardive dyskinesia; 
Whereas tardive dyskinesia is a movement disorder that is 
characterized by random, involuntary, and uncontrolled 
movements of different muscles in the face, trunk, and 
extremities; 
Whereas, in some cases, tardive dyskinesia may— 
(1) cause people to experience movement of the 
arms, legs, fingers, and toes; 
(2) affect the tongue, lips, and jaw; and 
(3) cause swaying movements of the trunk or hips 
and impact the muscles associated with walking, speech, 
eating, and breathing; 
Whereas tardive dyskinesia can develop months, years, or 
decades after a person starts taking DRBAs and even 
after they have discontinued use of those medications; 
Whereas not everyone who takes a DRBA develops tardive 
dyskinesia, but if tardive dyskinesia develops, it is often 
permanent; 
Whereas common risk factors for tardive dyskinesia include 
advanced age and alcoholism or other substance abuse 
disorders; 
Whereas postmenopausal women and people with a mood dis-
order are also at higher risk of developing tardive 
dyskinesia; 
Whereas a person is at higher risk for tardive dyskinesia 
after taking DRBAs for 3 months or longer, but the 
longer the person is on these medications, the higher the 
risk of developing tardive dyskinesia;

•HRES 1107 IH 
Whereas studies suggest that the overall risk of developing 
tardive dyskinesia after taking DRBAs is between 10 and 
30 percent; 
Whereas it is estimated that over 600,000 people in the 
United States suffer from tardive dyskinesia; 
Whereas, according to the National Alliance for Mental Ill-
ness, 1 in every 4 patients receiving long-term treatment 
with an antipsychotic medication will experience tardive 
dyskinesia; 
Whereas years of difficult and challenging research have re-
sulted in recent scientific breakthroughs, with 2 new 
treatments for tardive dyskinesia approved by the Food 
and Drug Administration of the Department of Health 
and Human Services; 
Whereas tardive dyskinesia is often unrecognized, and pa-
tients 
suffering 
from 
the 
illness 
are 
commonly 
misdiagnosed; 
Whereas regular screening for tardive dyskinesia in patients 
taking DRBA medications is recommended by the Amer-
ican Psychiatric Association; 
Whereas patients suffering from tardive dyskinesia often suf-
fer embarrassment due to abnormal and involuntary 
movements, which leads them to withdraw from society 
and increasingly isolate themselves as the disease pro-
gresses; 
Whereas caregivers of patients with tardive dyskinesia face 
many challenges and are often responsible for the overall 
care of the tardive dyskinesia patient; and 
Whereas the House of Representatives can raise awareness of 
tardive dyskinesia in the public and medical community: 
Now, therefore, be it 
02:30 May 12, 2022
