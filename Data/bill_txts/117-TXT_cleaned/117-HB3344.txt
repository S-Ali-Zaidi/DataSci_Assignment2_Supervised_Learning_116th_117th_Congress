SEC. 2. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
1
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
2
gress that— 
3
(1) fifth-generation telecommunications net-
4
works in allied and partner countries based on com-
5
mon, secure, transparent, democratic standards have 
6
the potential to increase cultural, political, and eco-
7
nomic exchanges leading to mutual job creation, 
8
closer citizen relations, and stronger democratic in-
9
stitutions; 
10
(2) the United States has national security and 
11
economic interests in assisting Central and Eastern 
12
European countries to improve the security of their 
13
telecommunications networks by reducing depend-
14
ence on covered telecommunications equipment or 
15
services that are often offered with predatory eco-
16
nomic inducements, and replacing them with secure 
17
telecommunications equipment or services; 
18
(3) China’s Belt and Road Initiative and the 
19
17+1 Initiative seek to undermine Central and 
20
Eastern Europe’s infrastructure resilience and sov-
21
ereignty through predatory inducements from state- 
22
linked providers of telecommunications equipment or 
23
services such as Huawei Technologies Company and 
24
ZTE Corporation;

1
of democratic and like-minded allies and partners to 
2
counter the rise of global malign actors such as 
3
China and Russia, and build resilience in Central 
4
and Eastern Europe against malign influences; and 
5
(5) in order to ensure robust military coordina-
6
tion and interoperability with the North Atlantic 
7
Treaty Organization (NATO) and transatlantic al-
8
lies and partners, the United States should ensure 
9
that allies’ and partners’ telecommunications net-
10
works are secure and free from potential threats in 
11
accordance with the 2019 NATO London Declara-
12
tion. 
13
(b) STATEMENT OF POLICY.—It is the policy of the 
14
United States— 
15
(1) to strengthen the transatlantic alliance 
16
based on shared values in the face of rising malign 
17
influence from the Russian Federation and the Peo-
18
ple’s Republic of China, nations that seek to under-
19
mine democratic institutions and values; 
20
(2) to encourage public and private sector in-
21
vestment in European telecommunications infra-
22
structure projects to ensure secure telecommuni-
23
cations and to catalyze economic advancement

(3) to provide economically feasible alternatives

to financing from providers of covered telecommuni-
4

(4) to engage in diplomacy with European allies 
6
and partners to strengthen United States and Euro-
7
pean private sector efforts to develop common tele-
8
communications technology and industry standards,

and in turn promote them globally;

nized by twelve Central and Eastern European coun-
12
tries of the European Union to increase infrastruc-
13
ture resiliency and reduce reliance on malign actors, 
14
including in the telecommunications space; and 
15
(6) to support the people of Ukraine, Moldova, 
16
Georgia, and the Western Balkan countries in their 
17
desire for integration into euro-Atlantic institutions 
18
and economies through enhanced cross-border tele-
