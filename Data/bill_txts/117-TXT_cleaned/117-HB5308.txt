•HR 5308 IH
(1) Section 9A of the Richard B. Russell Na-
1
tional School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1758b) requires 
2
all local educational agencies participating in a pro-
3
gram authorized by the Richard B. Russell National 
4
School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq.) or the 
5
Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et 
6
seq.) to establish a local school wellness policy for 
7
schools under the jurisdiction of local educational 
8
agencies that include nutrition promotion and edu-
9
cation. However, there are no specific requirements 
10
regarding the amount of time or type of classes that 
11
school children have to spend or take in nutrition 
12
education. 
13
(2) Some schools include in their health edu-
14
cation classes some general information about nutri-
15
tion, but there are no specific guidelines of what the 
16
minimum requirements should be. The mean number 
17
of hours spent on nutrition education in the first 4 
18
years of school is only 13 hours per year. A min-
19
imum of 50 hours per year are thought to be nec-
20
essary to influence behavior.

(3) Each local educational agency participating 
22
in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell 
23
National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq.)
