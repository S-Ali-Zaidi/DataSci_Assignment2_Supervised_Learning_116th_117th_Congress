RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the 75th anniversary of United Spinal Associa-
tion, a leading national advocacy organization that is 
dedicated to promoting the independence and enhancing 
the quality of life of all people living with spinal cord 
injuries and neurological disorders, including veterans, 
and providing support and information to their loved 
ones, care providers, and personal support networks. 
Whereas, in 1946, a group of returning veterans from World 
War II in New York, New York, formed the organization 
now known as United Spinal Association to address the 
needs of paralyzed veterans;

Whereas, in 1948, members of this organization advocated 
for and secured the first accessible housing bill in the 
United States (the Act of June 19, 1948 (62 Stat. 500; 
Public Law 80–702)), which provided Federal funds for 
the building of accessible homes for paralyzed veterans; 
Whereas, in 1968, members of this organization advocated 
for the passage of the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 
(42 U.S.C. 4151 et seq.), which guarantees equal access 
to federally funded buildings and facilities for wheelchair 
users and all people of the United States with disabilities; 
Whereas, in 1970, James J. Peters, who would later lead 
United Spinal Association, exposed the deplorable condi-
tions that paralyzed Vietnam veterans faced at the Bronx 
Veterans Administration Hospital with an article in 
LIFE magazine, leading the Veterans Administration to 
establish a national spinal cord injury service office to ad-
dress the needs of paralyzed veterans and the renovation 
of the Bronx Veterans Administration Hospital, which 
was later named for Peters; 
Whereas, in 1985, New York City settled a lawsuit initiated 
by United Spinal Association, agreeing to make all city 
buses, key subway stations and commuter rail stations, 
and all new transit stations accessible to wheelchair 
users, and New York City established a paratransit sys-
tem for people unable to use mass transit, leading to a 
model that would be incorporated as part of the transpor-
tation provisions of the landmark Americans with Dis-
abilities Act (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.); 
Whereas, regardless of a person’s level of abilities, United 
Spinal Association seeks to build an inclusive world 
that—

(1) removes barriers, particularly for wheelchair 
users; 
(2) embraces the talents of all people with disabil-
ities to achieve their full potential; and 
(3) provides people with disabilities equal opportuni-
ties to pursue their interests and dreams; 
Whereas United Spinal Association continues to support and 
advocate on behalf of more than 2,000,000 people in the 
United States living with spinal cord injuries or neuro-
logical disorders, as well as veterans, through— 
(1) proven programs and services, and nurturing in-
novative self-reliance, advocacy, and leadership; 
(2) empowering its members, their loved ones, care 
providers, and stakeholders with resources, one-on-one 
assistance, and peer support; 
(3) promoting independence through employment op-
portunities and inclusion into mainstream society; and 
(4) advocating for greater disability rights, including 
access to health care, rehabilitation, mobility equipment, 
transportation, community services, and the built envi-
ronment; and 
Whereas the legacy of James J. Peters, who once described 
the straightforward strategy in advocating for people in 
the United States with disabilities as simply refusing to 
accept no for an answer, is alive and well throughout 
United Spinal Association: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) recognizes that throughout 75 years of serv-

contributions to the lives of people in the United
