(1) Every State and large metropolitan area in 
1
the United States is facing a shortage of affordable 
2

3
low-income.

ing and are considered severely cost-burdened.

facing the United States cannot be addressed solely

(4) The Federal Government must adopt a pol-
12
icy that guarantees the right to housing for all indi-
13
viduals, strengthen neighborhoods, and address the 
14
failures of the free market in housing by building 
15
new public housing and investing in private afford-
16
able housing.
