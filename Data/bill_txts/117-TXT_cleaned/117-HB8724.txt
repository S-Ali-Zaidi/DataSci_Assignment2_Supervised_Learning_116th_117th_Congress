A BILL 
To amend the Public Health Service Act to establish a pro-
gram of research regarding the risks posed by the pres-
ence of dioxins, phthalates, pesticides, chemical fra-
grances, and other components of menstrual products 
and intimate care products. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Robin Danielson Men-
2
strual Product and Intimate Care Product Safety Act of 
3
2022’’. 
4
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
5
The Congress finds as follows: 
6
(1) Menstrual products and intimate care prod-
7
ucts are widely used in the United States today, but 
8
there is not enough research on the safety of or po-
9
tential chemical exposure from components of these 
10
products. 
11
(2) People who menstruate may be exposed to 
12
substances in tampons and other menstrual products 
13
for as long as 40 years over the course of their re-
14
productive lives. The average person who menstru-
15
ates may use up to 16,000 tampons in their lifetime. 
16
(3) Trace amounts of dioxins can be found in 
17
tampons and other menstrual products. The Envi-
18
ronmental Protection Agency and the International 
19
Agency for Research on Cancer, an arm of the 
20
World Health Organization, have concluded that 
21
dioxins are a probable human carcinogen (cancer- 
22
causing agent). 
23
(4) Chemical testing of menstrual products 
24
from around the world have detected several addi-
25
tional chemicals of concern including phthalates, 
26

•HR 8724 IH
volatile organic compounds, pesticides, carbon disul-
1
fide, 
and 
per-and 
polyfluoroalkyl 
substances 
2
(PFAS). 
3
(5) Intimate care products frequently contain 
4
undisclosed fragrance chemicals, some of which may 
5
be allergens, reproductive toxins, and carcinogens. 
6
Such products also contain potentially harmful pre-
7
servatives. Research released by Apothercare, Wom-
8
en’s Voices for the Earth, and Black Women for 
9
Wellness found that some intimate care products 
10
specifically inhibit the growth of lactobacillus, a cru-
11
cial type of healthy bacteria found in the vaginal 
12
microbiome. Disruption of the vaginal microbiome 
13
can lead to significant health problems including 
14
bacterial vaginosis, increased risk of sexually trans-
15
mitted diseases, and fertility concerns. 
16
(6) Intimate care products (especially douches 
17
and powders) have been associated with higher levels 
18
of toxic chemicals in the bodies of people who use 
19
them. Specifically, phthalate levels in urine were sig-
20
nificantly higher in people who douche frequently. 
21
Another study found significantly higher levels of 
22
1,4–dichlorobenzene in the blood of people who 
23
douche frequently and higher levels of ethylbenzene 
24
in the blood of intimate powder users.

(7) Research regarding the presence of chemi-
1
cals in menstrual products and intimate care prod-
2
ucts plays a role in advancing health equity for pop-
3
ulations that have historically experienced health dis-
4
parities, including Black people. 
5
(8) Regulatory oversight of the safety of mate-
6
rials in menstrual and intimate care products is lim-
7
ited. The Food and Drug Administration has histori-
8
cally relied on data provided by manufacturers of 
9
menstrual products in determining product safety. 
10
Intimate care products generally do not need ap-
11
proval by the Food and Drug Administration before 
12
they go on the market, and manufacturers have the 
13
responsibility to ensure the safety of their products.

PRODUCTS AND INTIMATE CARE PRODUCTS. 
17
Part F of title IV of the Public Health Service Act 
18
(42 U.S.C. 287d et seq.) is amended by adding at the end 
19
the following new section:
