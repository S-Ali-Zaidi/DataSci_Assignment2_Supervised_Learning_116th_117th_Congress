A BILL 
To require additional disclosures with respect to nominees 
to serve as chiefs of missions, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Bolstering the Effec-
4
tiveness, Success, and Transparency of Ambassadors Act’’ 
5
or the ‘‘BEST Ambassadors Act’’. 
6
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
7
Congress finds the following: 
8
(1) The Foreign Service Act of 1980 (Public 
9
Law 96–465) states, ‘‘An individual appointed or as-
10

•HR 5643 IH
signed to be a chief of mission should possess clearly 
1
demonstrated competence to perform the duties of a 
2
chief of mission, including, to the maximum extent 
3
practicable, a useful knowledge of the principal lan-
4
guage or dialect of the country in which the indi-
5
vidual is to serve, and knowledge and understanding 
6
of the history, the culture, the economic and political 
7
institutions, and the interests of that country and its 
8
people’’ and continues that, accordingly, ‘‘positions 
9
as chief of mission should normally be accorded to 
10
career members of the [Foreign] Service.’’. 
11
(2) The percentage of ambassadorships filled by 
12
political appointees has increased over the past 40 
13
years. During President Jimmy Carter’s term, be-
14
tween 1977 and 1981, about 26 percent of ambas-
15
sadorships were filled by political appointees. During 
16
President Ronald Reagan’s terms, between 1981 and 
17
1989, about 38 percent were. More recently, under 
18
President Barack Obama, about 30 percent of am-
19
bassadors were political appointees, while about 43 
20
percent were under President Donald J. Trump as 
21
of September 14, 2020. 
22
(3) The United States practice of appointing 
23
political ambassadors is atypical globally. According 
24
to a 2017 University of Texas at Austin study, ‘‘At 
25

•HR 5643 IH
the senior level, the United States is an extreme 
1
outlier among foreign services in the number of po-
2
litical appointees as ambassadors, even in key 
3
posts.’’. 
4
(4) Political appointees are not necessarily un-
5
successful ambassadors. According to the 2017 Uni-
6
versity of Texas study, ‘‘there have been highly ac-
7
complished political appointees who have been su-
8
perb ambassadors.’’ The report continues, however, 
9
‘‘there have been many more patronage appointees 
10
with no relevant qualifications, having been chosen 
11
principally for their support in presidential election 
12
campaigns. Contrast these U.S. ambassadors with 
13
their counterparts from other countries, who typi-
14
cally speak several languages, are well versed in the 
15
country to which they are assigned and are career 
16
professionals with extensive knowledge of their home 
17
ministries.’’. 
18
(5) The Foreign Service Act of 1980 states, 
19
‘‘Contributions to political campaigns should not be 
20
a factor in the appointment of an individual as a 
21
chief of mission.’’. However, this law has not fore-
22
stalled the appointment—by both Democratic and 
23
Republican presidents—of campaign donors without 
24
apparent qualifications to serve in these posts.

(6) To ensure the United States has the best 
1
representation possible abroad, it will be necessary 
2
to preserve the option to appoint political ambas-
3
sadors while enacting safeguards to ensure these ap-
4
pointees are nominated because of their qualifica-
5
tions, not their campaign contributions.

SEC. 3. ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES REQUIRED WITH RE-
7
SPECT TO NOMINEES. 
8
Section 304 of the Foreign Service Act of 1980 (22 
9
U.S.C. 3944) is amended as follows:

14
Service, the President shall also include in such re-
15
port a justification explaining whether a career 
16
member is available to fill such position and the 
17
manner and extent to which the nominee is never-
18
theless uniquely qualified to serve in such position.’’. 
19
(2) In paragraph (2) of subsection (b)— 
20

21

4
following new paragraphs: 
5
‘‘(3) With respect to each nomination for an in-
6
dividual to be a chief of mission, the President shall

8
Senate that any campaign contributions made by the 
9
nominee or members of his or her immediate family, 
10
whether or not included in the report described in 
11
paragraph (2), played no role in such nomination. 
12
‘‘(4) Each individual nominated by the Presi-
13
dent to be a chief of mission shall include in his or 
14
her statement to the Committee on Foreign Rela-
15
tions of the Senate an explanation of the manner
