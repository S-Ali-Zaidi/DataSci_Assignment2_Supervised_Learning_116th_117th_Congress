A BILL 
To amend the Employee Retirement Income Security Act 
of 1974 to provide for greater spousal protection under 
defined contribution plans, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Women’s Retirement

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 4678 IH
(1) Approximately 25 percent of non-retired 
1
adults have no defined benefit plan or retirement 
2
savings, according to 2020 data from the Board of 
3
Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 
4
(2) In 2020, one-third of the private sector 
5
workforce did not have access to a retirement plan 
6
at the workplace, and only half of the workforce ac-
7
tually participated in a retirement plan. 
8
(3) Women’s retirement preparedness often lags 
9
significantly behind their male counterparts’, result-
10
ing in the median income for women aged 65 and 
11
older in 2020 being just 83 percent of the median 
12
income of men aged 65 and older, including income 
13
from social security, pension plans, investments, and 
14
earnings. 
15
(4) Among people aged 75 and older, 13.2 per-
16
cent of women live in poverty, while 8.8 percent of 
17
men live in poverty. 
18
(5) Women make up two-thirds of low-wage 
19
workers, even though they comprise less than half of 
20
all workers, and low-wage workers are less likely 
21
than other workers to participate in a retirement 
22
plan at work. 
23
(6) Because of the pay gap, women working 
24
full-time, year-round typically lose $406,280 over a 
25
01:08 Aug 06, 2021
H4678

•HR 4678 IH
40-year career thereby requiring the average woman 
1
to work almost a decade longer than her male coun-
2
terpart to make up that career wage gap. For Black 
3
and Latina women, the career wage gap is even larg-
4
er at $964,400 and $1,163,920, respectively. 
5
(7) Due to the lower lifetime wages stemming 
6
from unequal pay and caregiving duties, the average 
7
Social Security benefit in 2019 for a woman age 65 
8
or older was $13,505 a year, while for men such av-
9
erage benefit was $17,374 a year. 
10
(8) The COVID–19 pandemic has exacerbated 
11
the existing gender gap in retirement savings as 
12
women have been more likely to leave the workforce 
13
for caregiving. Women, especially women of color, 
14
have also been more likely to lose their jobs during 
15
the pandemic due to overrepresentation in industries 
16
severely hit by the pandemic. 
17
(9) Just 1 in 5 part-time workers who work a 
18
full year are eligible for a retirement plan, and 
19
women are almost twice as likely as men to work 
20
part-time. 
21
(10) While traditional defined benefit retire-
22
ment plans have spousal protections, defined con-
23
tribution retirement plans, which have become in-
24
01:08 Aug 06, 2021
H4678
4 
•HR 4678 IH
creasingly common, currently provide no similar 
1
spousal protections. 
2
(11) Every year, more than 1,200,000 couples 
3
get divorced in the United States. After the family 
4
home, retirement savings tends to be the largest 
5
asset to be divided in a divorce. 
6
(12) While fees and expenses associated with 
7
retirement plans have been in decline, participants 
8
have seen direct charges for processing qualified do-
9
mestic relations orders increase significantly.
