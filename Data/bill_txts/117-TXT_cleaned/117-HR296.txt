in the United States more than 1,200,000 people are liv-
ing with HIV, and every year approximately 40,000 peo-
ple acquire HIV;

Whereas 44 percent of young people living with HIV 
(YPLWHIV) ages 13 to 24 are unaware of their HIV 
status; 
Whereas African-American youth are most impacted by the 
epidemic, representing 57 percent of new transmissions 
in young people ages 13 to 24; 
Whereas African-American young men who have sex with 
men (YMSM) ages 13 to 24 comprise 51 percent of new 
transmissions among all YMSM; 
Whereas the Division of Adolescent and School Health 
(DASH) is the only Federal program supporting HIV 
prevention for adolescents in schools; 
Whereas the Nation’s largest Federal program dedicated to 
providing care and treatment for people living with HIV 
was named after Ryan White, a teenager from Indiana 
who helped educate a Nation about HIV and AIDS in the 
1980s; 
Whereas the Ryan White Part D Program is one of the na-
tional efforts to link YPLWHIV to medical care and sup-
port services; 
Whereas the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act 
(PPACA) provides youth, including those living with or 
impacted by HIV and AIDS, better access to health care 
coverage, more health insurance options, additional fund-
ing for sex education, a prohibition against denying peo-
ple living with HIV access to health care, and expanded 
access to Medicaid which will support more YPLWHIV 
receiving care; and 
Whereas April 10 of each year is now recognized as National 
Youth HIV & AIDS Awareness Day: Now, therefore, be 
it
