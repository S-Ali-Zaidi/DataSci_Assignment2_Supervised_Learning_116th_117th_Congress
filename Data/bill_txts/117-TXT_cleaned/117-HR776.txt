RESOLUTION 
Expressing the support of the House of Representatives for 
continued efforts to strengthen science, technology, engi-
neering, and mathematics (STEM) education, especially 
for girls and minority students, in order to diversify 
and expand the opportunities available to all Americans 
in the global market and to bolster the vitality of the 
United States economy. 
Whereas the competitiveness of the United States in the glob-
al economy in the 21st century depends on innovations 
based on citizens’ developed knowledge of science, tech-
nology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM);

Whereas knowledge in STEM fields is necessary to ensure 
the security of the United States; 
Whereas an increasing number of jobs require an educational 
foundation in science and mathematics; 
Whereas high-quality education in science will remain critical 
to understanding and combating the growing issue of cli-
mate change; 
Whereas hands-on experience with STEM education shows 
students that they can make a meaningful, tangible im-
pact on today’s world; 
Whereas the emergence of the arts as a necessary factor in 
STEM curriculum further develops students’ aptitudes in 
communication, critical thinking, and collaboration, and 
inspires innovation and creativity; 
Whereas today’s scientists, engineers, mathematicians, and 
educators have the power to inspire the innovators of to-
morrow; 
Whereas women, African Americans, Native Americans, and 
Latinx people are currently underrepresented in STEM 
fields, meaning that much of the United States potential 
remains untapped; 
Whereas diversity in any field incorporates different experi-
ences and ideas which ultimately lead to more creative 
and pioneering solutions to the problems that the United 
States faces today and the challenges it will face in the 
future; 
Whereas increasing the inclusion of women and people of 
color in science and technology sectors provides role mod-
els who will inspire students of all backgrounds and iden-
tities;
