To amend section 249 of title 18, United States Code, to 
specify lynching as a hate crime act. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Emmett Till 
4
Antilynching Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) In the 20th century lynching occurred most-
8
ly in southern States by White southerners against 
9
Black southerners.

(2) In 1892, the Tuskegee Institute began to 
1
record statistics of lynchings and reported that 
2
4,742 reported lynchings had taken place by 1968, 
3
of which 3,445 of the victims were Black. 
4
(3) Most of the lynchings that occurred in the 
5
South were mass moblike lynchings. 
6
(4) Mass moblike lynchings were barbaric by 
7
nature characterized by members of the mob, mostly 
8
White southerners, shooting, burning, and muti-
9
lating the victim’s body, alive. 
10
(5) In ‘‘Anatomy of a Lynching: The Killing of 
11
Claude Neal’’, community papers readily advertised 
12
mob lynchings, as evidenced by a Florida local paper 
13
headline: ‘‘Florida to Burn Negro at Stake: Sex 
14
Criminal Seized from Brewton Jail, Will be Muti-
15
lated, Set Afire in Extra-Legal Vengeance for 
16
Deed.’’ 
17
(6) Civil rights groups documented and pre-
18
sented Congress evidence of vigilante moblike 
19
lynchings. 
20
(7) Evidence by NAACP investigator Howard 
21
Kester documented the extreme brutality of these 
22
lynchings. An excerpt from ‘‘Anatomy of a Lynch-
23
ing’’ further illustrates this point: ‘‘After taking the 
24
nigger to the woods about four miles from Green-

wood, they cut off his penis. He was made to eat it. 
1
Then they cut off his testicles and made him eat 
2
them and say he liked it.’’ 
3
(8) Many civil rights groups, notably the Anti- 
4
Lynching Crusaders, also known as the ALC, oper-
5
ating under the umbrella of the NAACP, made nu-
6
merous requests to Congress to make lynching a 
7
Federal crime. 
8
(9) Congressman George Henry White, an Afri-
9
can American, introduced the first Federal anti-
10
lynching bill and subsequently nearly 200 anti-lynch-
11
ing bills were introduced in the Congress during the 
12
first half of the 20th century. 
13
(10) Between 1890 and 1952, seven Presidents 
14
petitioned Congress to end lynching. 
15
(11) Between 1920 and 1940, the House of 
16
Representatives passed three strong anti-lynching 
17
measures, of which Congress came closest to enact-
18
ing anti-lynching legislation sponsored by Congress-
19
man Leonidas C. Dyer in 1922. 
20
(12) On all three occasions, opponents of anti- 
21
lynching legislation, argued States’ rights and used 
22
the filibuster, or the threat of it, to block the Senate 
23
from voting on the measures.

(13) The enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 
1
1968 was the closest Congress ever came in the 
2
post-Reconstruction era to enacting anti-lynching 
3
legislation. 
4
(14) In 2005, the Senate passed a resolution, 
5
sponsored by Senators Mary Landrieu and George 
6
Allen, apologizing for the Senate’s failure to enact 
7
anti-lynching legislation as a Federal crime, with 
8
Senator Landrieu saying, ‘‘There may be no other 
9
injustice in American history for which the Senate 
10
so uniquely bears responsibility.’’ 
11
(15) To heal past and present racial injustice, 
12
Congress must make lynching a Federal crime so 
13
our Nation can begin reconciliation.
