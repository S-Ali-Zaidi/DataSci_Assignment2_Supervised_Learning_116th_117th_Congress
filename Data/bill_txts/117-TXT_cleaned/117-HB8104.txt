(2) ELEMENTS.—The report required under 
8
paragraph (1) shall include the following: 
9
(A) A description of the specific number 
10
and type of semiconductors for key systems and 
11
munitions, delineated by technical specifica-
12
tions, performance requirements, and end-use 
13
applications, that the Department of Defense 
14
requires to execute and sustain the operational 
15
plans of the Department during a conflict with 
16
a strategic competitor in the Indo-Pacific for 
17
not less than six months. 
18
(B) A description of any supply chain 
19
vulnerabilities or choke points, including from 
20
sole sources of supply or geographic proximity 
21
to strategic competitors, involving the critical 
22
minerals and strategic raw materials (including 
23
chemicals) required to produce the semiconduc-
24
tors described in subparagraph (A).

competitors, or legacy technology, involving the 
4
manufacturing equipment required for each 
5
step in the manufacturing process from the raw 
6
materials described in subparagraph (B) to the

scribed in subparagraph (A), and an identifica-
9
tion of potential secure sources of supply or 
10
manufacturing involving the United States, al-
11
lied, or partner nations.

(D) An analysis of the ability of the De-
13
partment of Defense and private industry, as 
14
appropriate, to procure the semiconductors de-
15
scribed in subparagraph (A) and mitigate the 
16
vulnerabilities identified in subparagraphs (B) 
17
and (C), during a conflict with a strategic com-
18
petitor in the Indo-Pacific lasting not less than 
19
six months, along with associated recommenda-
20
tions, any additional necessary authorities to 
21
carry out such recommendations, and the cost 
22
of each recommendation.
