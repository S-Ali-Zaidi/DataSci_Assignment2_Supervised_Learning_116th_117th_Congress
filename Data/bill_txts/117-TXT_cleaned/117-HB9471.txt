multi-institutional collaborations, and other entities 
14
the Secretary determines appropriate. The Secretary 
15
may implement the Testbed as a single site or more

subject to the availability of appropriations. 
16
(2) RENEWAL.—Upon the expiration of any pe-
17
riod of support of the Testbed, the Secretary may 
18
renew support for the Testbed, on a merit-reviewed 
19
process, for a period of not more than five years. 
20
(d) TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER.—The Secretary, in co-
21
ordination with the Director of the Office of Technology 
22
Transitions of the Department, shall facilitate the trans-
23
lation and secure transfer to industry of research results
