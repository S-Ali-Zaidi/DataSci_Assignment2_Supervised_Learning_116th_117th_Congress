RESOLUTION 
Affirming the right of all renters to a safe, affordable, and 
decent home. 
Whereas housing is a basic human right; 
Whereas evidence-based research has shown that families 
with safe, decent, and affordable homes are better able 
to find employment, achieve economic mobility, perform 
better in school, and maintain improved health; 
Whereas providing housing assistance is one of the most ef-
fective ways to help families, children, and youth escape 
poverty and domestic violence and to prevent homeless-
ness; 
Whereas investing in affordable housing infrastructure has 
numerous benefits for the economy, including creating

jobs, boosting families’ incomes, promoting healthy fami-
lies, and encouraging further development; 
Whereas far too many families living in urban, suburban, and 
rural communities struggle to afford their rent each 
month, putting them at increased risk of eviction and 
homelessness; 
Whereas people of color, especially single Black and Latina 
mothers, experience disparate rates of eviction; 
Whereas according to the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development (HUD) point-in-time count of 2020, there 
were over 580,000 people in the United States experi-
encing homelessness on any given night, including over 
172,000 people in families with children; 
Whereas homelessness has become so pervasive that some 
States and cities have declared that homelessness has 
reached a state of emergency; 
Whereas people experiencing homelessness are more likely to 
be the victims of violent crimes and face dehumanizing 
conditions; 
Whereas major progress toward the national goals for ending 
homelessness in our Nation has stalled in the absence of 
increased funding; 
Whereas a shortage of affordable housing exists in every 
State and major metropolitan area; 
Whereas a full-time worker earning the Federal minimum 
wage cannot afford a modest two-bedroom apartment in 
any State, metropolitan area, or county in the United 
States; 
Whereas over half of all renters are cost-burdened, paying 
more than 30 percent of their income for housing, and

•HRES 624 IH 
70 percent of extremely low-income households are se-
verely cost-burdened, paying more than half of their in-
come for housing; 
Whereas rapidly rising rents across the country have pushed 
many long-time residents and families out of the commu-
nities they call home; 
Whereas 3 out of every 4 families in need of housing assist-
ance are turned away due to chronic underfunding; 
Whereas the role of Federal affordable housing investment is 
even more important given the limited ability of the pri-
vate market alone to address these needs; 
Whereas various programs at the Department of Housing 
and Urban Development provide Federal rental assist-
ance, which helps about 10,400,000 people in 5,200,000 
households, including helping nearly 6,300,000 families 
with children avoid homelessness; 
Whereas such programs include the Public Housing program, 
the section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers (HCV) program, 
the section 8 Project-Based Rental Assistance program, 
the section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly pro-
gram, the section 811 Supportive Housing for Persons 
with Disabilities program, and the Housing Opportunities 
for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) program; 
Whereas despite leveraging billions of dollars in private re-
sources to preserve and expand the supply of affordable 
housing, affordable housing programs continue to be 
chronically underfunded despite their success at providing 
safe housing to families in need; 
Whereas chronic underfunding of the Public Housing Capital 
Fund has led to a backlog of up to $70,000,000,000 in 
capital repairs and deteriorating conditions for residents;

Whereas without Federal investments, many more families 
would be homeless, living in substandard or overcrowded 
conditions, or struggling to meet other basic needs be-
cause too much of their limited income would be used to 
pay rent; 
Whereas the impact of the COVID–19 pandemic was exacer-
bated by the lack of an effective housing safety net, 
which created challenges for the public health strategy of 
urging people to stay home to avoid contagion; 
Whereas, due to the pandemic, an even greater number of 
people 
are 
precariously 
housed, 
with 
more 
than 
6,000,000 households behind on their rent; 
Whereas severe delays in the distribution of emergency rental 
assistance provided during the pandemic has created ad-
ditional unnecessary hardship for both renters and prop-
erty owners; 
Whereas even renters with housing subsidies often face bar-
riers to finding housing providers willing to rent to them; 
Whereas under current Federal law, housing discrimination 
against a renter is illegal if it is based on race, color, reli-
gion, sex, familial status, national origin, or disability; 
Whereas 68,000,000 Americans believe they have been treat-
ed differently in their search for housing based on their 
race, color, religion, sex, familial status, national origin, 
or disability; 
Whereas renters and others experiencing housing need should 
be protected against housing discrimination through 
stronger enforcement of fair housing laws; and 
Whereas despite various clarifying guidance from HUD, the 
reentry community continues to face barriers in trying to
