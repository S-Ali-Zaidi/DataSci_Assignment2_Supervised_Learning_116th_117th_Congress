This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Global Learning Loss

Assessment Act of 2021’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress makes the following findings:

•HR 1500 IH
(1) Before the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (com-
1
monly referred to as ‘‘COVID–19’’) pandemic began, 
2
258,000,000 children were out of school, including 
3
130,000,000 girls. 
4
(2) Students already at a disadvantage before 
5
COVID–19 will experience greater learning loss, 
6
thereby worsening inequity and inequality. 
7
(3) Approximately 90 percent of the world’s 
8
student population—over 1,600,000,000 children 
9
and youth—have had their education disrupted by 
10
school closure due to COVID–19. 
11
(4) School closures lead to interrupted learning, 
12
poor nutrition, gaps in childcare, increased dropout 
13
rates, exposure to violence, and social isolation. 
14
(5) Up to 24,000,000 children are at risk of 
15
dropping out of school permanently due to rising lev-
16
els of child poverty associated with the pandemic. 
17
(6) School closure and remote learning is espe-
18
cially burdensome on girls, who are frequently ex-
19
pected to shoulder more household chores and re-
20
sponsibilities and are more vulnerable to gender- 
21
based violence. 
22
(7) During the Ebola epidemic, nationwide 
23
school closures in Sierra Leone in 2014 led to in-
24
creased instances of sexual- and gender-based vio-
25

lence, teenage pregnancy, school dropout, and child 
1
labor for girls. 
2
(8) More than 60 percent of national distance 
3
learning alternatives rely exclusively on online plat-
4
forms but two-thirds of the world’s school aged chil-
5
dren, or 1,300,000,000 children aged 3–17, do not 
6
have internet connection in their homes, and schools 
7
and local learning centers also frequently have inad-
8
equate internet connectivity. Eighty percent of stu-
9
dents in sub-Saharan Africa lack such access, with 
10
an even higher rate for girls. 
11
(9) Children and youth with disabilities are par-
12
ticularly vulnerable to the health, education, and so-
13
cioeconomic consequences of the pandemic. As a fur-
14
ther challenge, distance learning tools are not always 
15
accessible to learners with disabilities or those with 
16
complex learning needs, especially in poorer and 
17
rural households. 
18
(10) Before the COVID–19 pandemic, refugee 
19
children were twice as likely to be out of school as 
20
other youth, and school closures and a lack of access 
21
to distance learning tools threaten to make the edu-
22
cation gap among refugee children even more severe. 
23
(11) The economic downturn caused by the 
24
COVID–19 pandemic could lead to an education fi-

nancing gap of $77,000,000,000 in low- and middle- 
1
income countries over the next two years. 
2
(12) The economic cost of school closures could 
3
be up to $1,337 per student, which on a global scale 
4
equates to approximately $10,000,000,000,000 in 
5
lost economic output over the coming generation.

SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
7
It is the policy of the United States that United 
8
States-funded basic education programs operating in for-
9
eign countries should— 
10
(1) provide inclusive learning opportunities for 
11
students and teachers, especially for the most 
12
marginalized, including girls, children with disabil-
13
ities, and previously out of school children; 
14
(2) build local capacity and help countries 
15
strengthen their education systems, including oppor-
16
tunities for early childhood development; 
17
(3) improve the availability, delivery, and qual-
18
ity of education services from early childhood 
19
through secondary education; 
20
(4) improve equity and safety in education serv-
21
ices; and 
22
(5) support the return of children to school who 
23
have experienced interruptions in their education 
24
due to the COVID–19 pandemic and work to enroll
