SEC. 2. NATIONAL METHANE RESEARCH PILOT STUDY. 
1
(a) IN GENERAL.—The Administrator, in consulta-
2
tion with the Secretary of Energy, the Administrator of 
3
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the 
4
Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
5
Administration, the Administrator of the Pipeline and 
6
Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, the Director 
7
of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, 
8
and the heads of other Federal agencies as appropriate, 
9
shall conduct a measurement-based national methane re-
10
search pilot study (in this section referred to as the ‘‘pilot 
11
study’’) to quantify methane emissions from covered oil 
12
and gas infrastructure. The Administrator shall employ a 
13
technology or suite of technologies for methane emissions 
14
measurement, research, and analysis. To the extent prac-
15
ticable, the Administrator shall consider utilizing innova-
16
tive technologies for methane emissions measurement and 
17
quantification. 
18
(b) REQUIREMENTS.—The pilot study shall— 
19
(1) encompass two regions, which shall be de-
20
termined by the Administrator; 
21
(2) identify areas consisting primarily of cov-
22
ered oil and gas infrastructure within each such re-
23
gion;

•HR 8991 IH
(3) develop and implement methodologies and 
1
procedures for a measurement-based evaluation of 
2
methane emissions from such infrastructure; 
3
(4) assess diverse approaches to the character-
4
ization of methane emissions from such infrastruc-
5
ture; and 
6
(5) consult with Federal, State, local, academic, 
7
nonprofit, and private sector entities, as appropriate. 
8
(c) REPORT.—Not later than two years after the date 
9
of the enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall sub-
10
mit to the appropriate committees of Congress, and make 
11
publicly available, a report assessing the results of the 
12
pilot study. The report shall include the following: 
13
(1) An overview of the findings of the pilot 
14
study pertaining to the quantification and character-
15
ization of methane emissions from covered oil and 
16
gas infrastructure. 
17
(2) An analysis of how the pilot study could 
18
support and inform the development and implemen-
19
tation of a national methane census study (in this 
20
section referred to as the ‘‘methane census’’), to be 
21
undertaken on a recurring basis and encompass all 
22
seven regions. Such analysis shall also examine the 
23
following:

•HR 8991 IH
(A) The feasibility of evaluating the 
1
amount of methane emissions from covered oil 
2
and gas infrastructure by region, industry seg-
3
ment, type of emission source, or any other cri-
4
terion, as a component of the methane census. 
5
(B) The necessary scope of measurement- 
6
based activities within regions in order to carry 
7
out the methane census. 
8
(C) Any onshore or offshore gaps within 
9
the scope of the pilot study that could merit in-
10
clusion as a part of the methane census. 
11
(D) The estimated budget that would be 
12
required to oversee the methane census. 
13
(E) Any other relevant topic, as deter-
14
mined by the Administrator. 
15
(3) An analysis of how the measurement-based 
16
evaluation of methane emissions from covered oil 
17
and gas infrastructure, as completed by the pilot 
18
study or contemplated for the methane census, could 
19
support efforts to reconcile data generated by top- 
20
down methods and bottom-up methods with respect 
21
to the Environmental Protection Agency’s Inventory 
22
of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks. Such 
23
analysis shall also examine the following:

(A) How methane emissions data from the 
1
pilot study or methane census could be utilized

as a part of a reconciliation process to better 
3
understand and improve data estimates from 
4
both top-down methods and bottom-up methods. 
5
(B) How methane emissions data from the 
6
pilot study or methane census could identify 
7
and help to explore any significant discrep-
8
ancies between top-down methods and bottom- 
9
up methods for methane emissions from covered 
10
oil and gas infrastructure. 
11
(C) Any other relevant topic, as deter-
12
mined by the Administrator. 
13
(4) A description of any research or technology 
14
gaps that were identified during the course of the

pilot study and could merit additional study to sup-
16
port the improvement of methane emissions meas-
17
urement and quantification.

19
pilot study, which, to the greatest extent possible 
20
and consistent with appropriate protections for con-
21

7
sible, shall ensure that all data collected as part of the 
8
pilot study adheres to data and metadata standards to 
9
support the public findability, accessibility, interoper-
10

11
shall consult with the heads of other Federal agencies, as 
12
appropriate, to— 
13
(1) facilitate effective data sharing regarding 
14
methane emissions measurement and quantification 
15
data; and 
16
(2) ensure that methane emissions measure-
17
ment and quantification data gathered by such other 
18
Federal agencies can be converted to a format that 
19
is consistent with the methodologies and procedures 
20
of the pilot study.
