Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

(1) The National Institutes of Health reported 
1
in March, 2021, that ‘‘people who have had evidence 
2
of a prior infection with SARS–CoV–2 . . . appear 
3
to be well protected against being reinfected with the 
4
virus . . .’’. The study stated, ‘‘the data from this 
5
study suggest that people who have had a positive 
6
result from a commercial antibody test appear to 
7
have substantial immunity to SARS–CoV–2 which 
8
means they are at a lower risk for future infection’’. 
9
(2) The National Institutes of Health reported 
10
in January 2021, that ‘‘after people recover from in-
11
fection with a virus, the immune system retains a 
12
memory of it. Immune cells and proteins that cir-
13
culate in the body can recognize and kill the patho-
14
gen if it’s encountered again, protecting against dis-
15
ease and reducing illness severity. All of these im-
16
mune system components have been found in people 
17
who recover from SARS–CoV–2, the virus that 
18
causes COVID–19. Researchers found durable im-
19
mune responses in the majority of people studied.’’. 
20
(3) A study at Emory University in July 2021, 
21
found that recovered COVID–19 patients retain 
22
broad and effective longer-term immunity to the dis-
23
ease. The study looked at 254 patients with mild to 
24
moderate symptoms over a period of eight months

and found that their immune response to the virus 
1
remained durable and strong. 
2
(4) Patient and doctor relationships should al-
3
ways be paramount and forefront in each patient’s 
4
life. 
5
(5) Religious, mental health, physical health, 
6
immune health, and other exemptions from vaccina-
7
tion requirements give patients and doctors the flexi-
8
bility to adapt to the limitations or prerequisites of 
9
a patient’s health.

SEC. 3. INAPPLICABILITY OF ANY COVID–19 VACCINE MAN-
11
DATE TO INDIVIDUALS WITH ANTIBODIES. 
12
Any individual who is demonstrated to have anti-
13
bodies to the virus that causes COVID–19 shall be exempt 
14
from any Federal mandate for vaccination against 
15
COVID–19.
