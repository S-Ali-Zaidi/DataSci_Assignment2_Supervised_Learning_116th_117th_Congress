CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of Congress regarding the end of impu-
nity of unpunished Serbian sexual war crimes during 
the 1999 Kosovo war in the case of United States citizen 
and sexual war crime survivor Vasfije Krasniqi Goodman 
and other survivors of sexual and gender-based violence. 
Whereas Vasfije Krasniqi was 16 years old during the 1999 
Kosovo war and living in Stanofc i Poshtem, Kosovo, 
then under the control of the Republic of Serbia, which 
was part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and led 
by Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic; 
Whereas, on April 14, 1999, a Serbian police officer entered 
Ms. Krasniqi’s family home in Stanofc i Poshtem, 
Kosovo, looking for all male occupants, and ordered Ms.

Krasniqi to go to the police station to give a statement 
about her father and brothers, who were not present; 
Whereas the Serbian police officer threatened to shoot every-
one present, including Ms. Krasniqi and her mother, be-
fore forcibly removing Ms. Krasniqi from the house and 
taking her to a Serbian village nearby; 
Whereas the Serbian police officer forced Ms. Krasniqi into 
an empty house off the main road and threw her onto 
dried corn stacks before taking her to his car, where he 
started raping her despite her yelling and screams for 
him to stop; 
Whereas Ms. Krasniqi was held at gunpoint and raped re-
peatedly before losing consciousness; 
Whereas, once Ms. Krasniqi regained consciousness, she 
begged the Serbian police officer to kill her, and the Ser-
bian police officer responded by saying, ‘‘No, I won’t be-
cause you will suffer more this way’’, and threatened to 
take her to an area full of Serbian forces where more 
people would rape her; 
Whereas the Serbian police officer later went into a local 
store in the same village, from where an older, crippled 
Serbian man emerged and forced Ms. Krasniqi out of the 
car and took her to an unfinished house where he raped 
her; 
Whereas, a few hours later, Ms. Krasniqi was taken back to 
her village where she was left out on the street and told 
not to tell anyone about what had transpired; 
Whereas Ms. Krasniqi did not want to go home having to ex-
plain to anyone what had happened to her, but instead 
walked through the village cemetery and hoped that her 
life would come to an end then and there;

Whereas, upon arriving at her uncle’s house hours after the 
assault, Ms. Krasniqi did not have to say a word, as ev-
eryone knew what had happened, witnessing her scratch-
es, bruises, cuts, and torn clothes; 
Whereas Ms. Krasniqi reported her case to the Kosovo Lib-
eration Army (KLA) the day after she was raped on 
April 15, 1999; 
Whereas, in March 1999, with the support of the United 
States, NATO began a 78-day air campaign against Ser-
bian forces in Kosovo after efforts to negotiate an end to 
the Kosovo war collapsed, leading to Serbia’s agreement 
to cease all military activity in Kosovo and to facilitate 
the withdrawal of Serbian forces from Kosovo, and the 
deployment of a NATO-led Kosovo Force (KFOR); 
Whereas the United Nations Security Council then passed 
Resolution 1244 on June 10, 1999, which established the 
United Nations Interim Administration Mission in 
Kosovo (UNMIK) as a temporary government until 
Kosovo’s own institutions had developed and dem-
onstrated the capacity to self-govern, which included var-
ious powers, such as the authority to administer justice 
in Kosovo and the ability to investigate and prosecute se-
rious crimes committed during the war; 
Whereas Ms. Krasniqi reported her case to UNMIK on Sep-
tember 10, 1999, with no outcome, as well as to the 
French KFOR on April 21, 2004, but inaction of both 
these bodies caused additional difficulties and delays in 
her case; 
Whereas Kosovo declared independence on February 17, 
2008, and has since received the recognition of over 100 
states, including the United States and 23 of the 28 Eu-
21:41 May 31, 2022

ropean Union member states, though Serbia still rejects 
such claim; 
Whereas the European Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo 
(EULEX) was launched in 2008 as a civilian mission to 
support rule-of-law institutions, accountability, and com-
pliance with international human rights standards in 
Kosovo, as well as to support the Specialist Chambers 
and Specialist Prosecutor’s Office in line with relevant 
Kosovo legislation within the framework of United Na-
tions Security Council Resolution 1244; 
Whereas Ms. Krasniqi moved to the United States in 2001, 
naturalized as a citizen in 2004, and now lives in 
Rowlett, Texas, with her husband and two children, each 
of whom are also United States citizens, and she has also 
taken the last name Goodman; 
Whereas Ms. Krasniqi Goodman reported her case to 
EULEX authorities and gave five interviews from August 
2010 to July 2012, and witnesses gave several testi-
monies from February 2011 to August 2012; 
Whereas, on November 12, 2012, the Special Prosecution Of-
fice of the Republic of Kosovo (SPRK) filed the indict-
ment PPS nr. 89/2012 against the perpetrators Jovica 
Dejanovic (DOB 09/11/1954), the Serbian police officer, 
and Djordje Bojkovic (DOB 11/13/1940), the older and 
crippled Serbian man, with the then-District Court of 
Mitrovica, which was amended on November 30, 2012; 
Whereas the main trial was held between April 4 to 15, 2013, 
and on April 17, 2013, the Basic Court of Mitrovica an-
nounced the judgment that both perpetrators were ac-
quitted of the charge of war crime against the civilian

population (rape), punishable under Articles 22 and 142 
CC SFRY; 
Whereas, on October 31, 2013, the SPRK Prosecutors sub-
mitted a joint appeal proposing that the judgment of the 
first instance court be modified and Jovica Dejanovic and 
Djordje Bojkovic be convicted of the criminal offense of 
war crime against civilian population, or in the alter-
native, to return the case to the court of first instance 
for a retrial; 
Whereas the Appellate Public Prosecutor moved the Court of 
Appeals to grant the appeal of the Special Prosecutors, 
and the Court of Appeals rendered its judgment on May 
27, 2014, and found both Jovica Dejanovic and Djordje 
Bojkovic guilty and convicted them of the war crime 
against civilians under Article 142 CC SFRY (now Arti-
cle 153 CCRK), sentencing them to 12 years and 10 
years of imprisonment, respectively; 
Whereas, on July 2014, Jovica Dejanovic and Djordje 
Bojkovic filed their appeals against the judgment of the 
Court of Appeals PaKr 503/13 dated May 27, 2014, and 
the Supreme Court of Kosovo rendered a ruling for the 
immediate release of Jovica Dejanovic and Djordje 
Bojkovic from the detention on remand; 
Whereas Jovica Dejanovic and Djordje Bojkovic were re-
leased, and nobody has been held responsible for the sex-
ual war crimes committed against Vasfije Krasniqi Good-
man; 
Whereas all prior mechanisms for pursuing accountability for 
war crimes in Kosovo have fallen short in bringing per-
petrators of sexual violence to justice, including the Inter-

national Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, 
UNMIK, EULEX, and the Kosovo judicial system; 
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) reports that approximately 20,000 individuals 
were the victims of conflict-related sexual violence during 
the Kosovo war, and Human Rights Watch reports that 
rape was used as a weapon of war and instrument of eth-
nic cleansing by Serbian forces during the Kosovo war; 
Whereas 20 years later and after approximately 20,000 indi-
viduals raped, there has only been one perpetrator 
brought to justice, Zoran Vukotic, by Prishtina Basic 
Court on July 5, 2021; 
Whereas the United Nations Security Council Resolution 
1820 was unanimously adopted on June 19, 2008, con-
demning the use of sexual violence as a tool of war, and 
declared that ‘‘rape and other forms of sexual violence 
can constitute war crimes, crimes against humanity or a 
constitutive act with respect to genocide’’; 
Whereas the United Nations Security Council Resolution 
2467 was adopted on April 23, 2019, ‘‘recalling the re-
sponsibilities of States to end impunity and to prosecute 
those responsible for crimes of genocide, crimes against 
humanity, and war crimes, perpetrated against civilians’’; 
and 
Whereas Vasfije Krasniqi Goodman testified before the Com-
mittee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representa-
tives on April 30, 2019, in a hearing titled ‘‘Kosovo’s 
Wartime Victims: The Quest for Justice’’, testifying for 
justice on behalf of her case and the 20,000 individuals 
raped during the Kosovo war: Now, therefore, be it

Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate

concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that— 
2
(1) those individuals who are responsible for the 
3
sexual war crimes on April 14, 1999, of United 
4
States citizen Vasfije Krasniqi Goodman in Kosovo 
5
should be brought to justice as per United Nations 
6
Security Council Resolutions 1820 and 2467; 
7
(2) it is reprehensible that no individuals have 
8
been found guilty for their sexual war crimes against 
9
Ms. Krasniqi Goodman; 
10
(3) the Government of the Republic of Serbia 
11
should stop protecting and glorifying any persons 
12
who were involved in war crimes during the Kosovo 
13
conflict and should make it a priority to investigate 
14
and prosecute any such individuals; 
15
(4) the United States should devote sufficient 
16
resources to fully assist and properly monitor efforts 
17
by the Government of Serbia and its relevant min-
18
istries and offices to investigate and prosecute cases 
19
of sexual violence during the Kosovo war, properly 
20
account for the role of such tactics in the attempted 
21
ethnic cleansing during the Kosovo war, and hold 
22
the Government of the Republic of Serbia account-
23
able for fully implementing its international, bilat-
24
eral, and national commitments in these regards;

•HCON 94 IH 
(5) progress in resolving Ms. Krasniqi Good-
1
man’s case and those involving other survivors of 
2
sexual violence during the Kosovo war should remain 
3
an important bilateral priority between the United 
4
States and the Government of the Republic of Ser-
5
bia; 
6
(6) the House of Representatives believes that 
7
all unpunished war crimes, including those involving 
8
sexual violence, should be properly investigated and 
9
prosecuted by all judicial institutions with jurisdic-
10
tion over war crimes committed during the Kosovo 
11
war; and 
12
(7) rape remains an unacceptable weapon of 
13
war throughout the world, and the United States 
14
should stand up for its citizens and people worldwide 
15
to hold perpetrators accountable, thereby sending an 
16
important message to the world that there are con-
17
sequences for committing such crimes.
