SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds that— 
2
(1) on January 1, 1998—nearly 25 years after 
3
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 
4
1974 was enacted and the employee stock ownership 
5
plan (hereafter in this section referred to as an 
6
‘‘ESOP’’) was created—employees were first per-
7
mitted to be owners of subchapter S corporations 
8
pursuant to the Small Business Job Protection Act 
9
of 1996 (Public Law 104–188); 
10
(2) with the passage of the Taxpayer Relief Act 
11
of 1997 (Public Law 105–34), Congress designed in-
12
centives to encourage businesses to become ESOP- 
13
owned S corporations; 
14
(3) since that time, several thousand companies 
15
have become ESOP-owned S corporations, creating 
16
an ownership interest for several million Americans 
17
in companies in every State in the country, in indus-
18
tries ranging from heavy manufacturing to tech-
19
nology development to services; 
20
(4) while estimates show that 40 percent of 
21
working Americans have no formal retirement ac-
22
count at all, every United States worker who is an 
23
employee-owner of an S corporation company 
24
through an ESOP has a valuable qualified retire-
25
ment savings account; 
26
03:44 Jul 10, 2021
H4141

•HR 4141 IH
(5) recent studies have shown that employees of 
1
ESOP-owned S corporations enjoy greater job sta-
2
bility than employees of comparable companies; 
3
(6) studies also show that employee-owners of S 
4
corporation ESOP companies have amassed mean-
5
ingful retirement savings through their S ESOP ac-
6
counts that will give them the means to retire with 
7
dignity; 
8
(7) under the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 
9
631 et seq.) and the regulations promulgated by the 
10
Administrator of the Small Business Administration, 
11
a small business concern that was eligible under the 
12
Small Business Act for the numerous preferences of 
13
the Act is denied treatment as a small business con-
14
cern after an ESOP acquires more than 49 percent 
15
of the business, even if the number of employees, the 
16
revenue of the small business concern, and the ra-
17
cial, gender, or other criteria used under the Act to 
18
determine whether the small business concern is eli-
19
gible for benefits under the Act remain the same, 
20
solely because of the acquisition by the ESOP; and 
21
(8) it is the goal of Congress to both preserve 
22
and foster employee ownership of S corporations 
23
through ESOPs.
