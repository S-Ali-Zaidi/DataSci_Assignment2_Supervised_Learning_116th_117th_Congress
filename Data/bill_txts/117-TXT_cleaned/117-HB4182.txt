(1) The world is in the midst of a global wildlife 
1
extinction crisis. 
2
(2) The extinction rate today is 1,000 times 
3
greater than the natural background rates estab-
4
lished over millions of years. 
5
(3) Wildlife and plant populations are rapidly 
6
declining, with 1,000,000 species facing extinction in 
7
the coming decades due to threats of habitat loss, 
8
climate change, wildlife exploitation, pollution and 
9
other human activities. 
10
(4) Unlike past mass-extinction events, the cur-
11
rent sixth mass extinction is a problem entirely 
12
caused by human-driven forces. 
13
(5) The drivers of the global wildlife extinction 
14
crisis will also degrade the life-support systems of 
15
societies around the world, including water purifi-
16
cation, oxygen production, carbon sequestration, and 
17
disease regulation. 
18
(6) Stopping the extinction crisis and restoring 
19
abundant wildlife populations will require strong im-
20
plementation of the Endangered Species Act and 
21
other wildlife laws including the Migratory Bird 
22
Treaty Act and Marine Mammal Protection Act.
