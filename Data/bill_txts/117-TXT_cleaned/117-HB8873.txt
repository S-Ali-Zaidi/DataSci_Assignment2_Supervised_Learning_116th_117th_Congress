A BILL 
To amend title 3, United States Code, to reform the process 
for the counting of electoral votes, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Presidential Election 
4
Reform Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Article II and the Twelfth Amendment to 
8
the Constitution govern how our Republic selects the 
9

•HR 8873 IH
President and Vice President of the United States. 
1
Article II provides that ‘‘each state shall appoint, in 
2
such manner as the legislature may direct, a number 
3
of electors, equal to the whole number of Senators 
4
and Representatives to which the State may be enti-
5
tled in the Congress.’’ (Constitution, article II, sec-
6
tion 1, clause 2). Article II provides that Congress 
7
has the authority to regulate the timing of such elec-
8
tions by setting the ‘‘time’’ of the Presidential elec-
9
tion and the ‘‘day’’ on which presidential electors 
10
cast their votes (Constitution, article II, section 1, 
11
clause 4). The Twelfth Amendment identifies Con-
12
gress’ responsibility for counting electoral votes: 
13
‘‘The President of the Senate shall, in the presence 
14
of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all 
15
the certificates and the votes shall then be counted. 
16
The person having the greatest number of votes for 
17
President, shall be the President, if such number be 
18
a majority of the whole number of Electors ap-
19
pointed.’’. Congress’ authorities in these respects are 
20
further bolstered by the Necessary and Proper 
21
Clause of the Constitution (article I, section 8, 
22
clause 18). 
23
(2) ‘‘On January 6, 2021, a mob professing 
24
support for then-President Trump violently attacked

the United States Capitol in an effort to prevent a 
1
Joint Session of Congress from certifying the elec-
2
toral college votes designating Joseph R. Biden the 
3
46th President of the United States.’’ Trump v. 
4
Thompson, 20 F.4th 10, 15 (D.C. Cir. 2021), cert. 
5
denied, 142 S. Ct. 1350 (2022). This constituted 
6
‘‘the single most deadly attack on the Capitol by do-
7
mestic forces in the history of the United States.’’ 
8
Trump, 20 F.4th at 35. ‘‘Then-Vice President 
9
Pence, Senators and Representatives were all forced 
10
to halt their constitutional duties and flee . . . for 
11
safety.’’ Id. at 16. ‘‘The events of January 6, 2021 
12
marked the most significant assault on the Capitol 
13
since the War of 1812.’’ Id. at 18–19. 
14
(3) The Electoral Count Act of 1887 should be 
15
amended to prevent other future unlawful efforts to 
16
overturn Presidential elections and to ensure future 
17
peaceful transfers of Presidential power. 
18
(4) The reforms contained in this Act are fully 
19
consistent with States’ constitutional authority vest-
20
ed by Article II to appoint electors; the reforms 
21
herein do not restrict the mode in which States law-
22
fully appoint their respective electors or resolve re-
23
lated contests or controversies, but instead ensure 
24
01:08 Sep 20, 2022

that those appointments, and the votes cast by those 
1
electors, are duly transmitted to Congress.
