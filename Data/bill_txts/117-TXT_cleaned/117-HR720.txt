Whereas, in October 2017, violent extremists locally known 
as al-Shabab or Ahlu al-Sunnah wal-Jamaah targeted ci-

human rights, security, and socioeconomic welfare in the 
Cabo Delgado Province; 
Whereas, since 2017, Ahlu al-Sunnah wal-Jamaah has killed 
thousands of civilians and brutalized communities in

who are forced to take up arms, and attacks against 
transportation, supply convoys, government facilities, and 
other buildings, such as homes, schools, and hospitals; 
Whereas, in 2018, the Cabo Delgado-based violent extremist 
group reportedly pledged allegiance to the Islamic State

cially Designated Global Terrorists under Executive 
Order 13224, and identified Tanzanian national Abu

Whereas, in late March 2021, ISIS-Mozambique launched a

Whereas international development of northern Mozambique’s 
natural resources has the potential to yield economic ben-
efit to the Cabo Delgado Province’s local populations 
through job creation, increased private investment, and 
expanded development initiatives, yet in some cases re-
source development has reportedly displaced local com-
munities and some have been inadequately compensated 
for lost land, homes, and disrupted livelihoods;
