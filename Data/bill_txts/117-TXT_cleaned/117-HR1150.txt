RESOLUTION 
Supporting the designation of May 2022 as ‘‘National Brain 
Tumor Awareness Month’’. 
Whereas more than an estimated 88,970 individuals will be 
diagnosed with a primary brain tumor in the United 
States in 2022, and an estimated 84,000 individuals in 
the United States were diagnosed with a primary brain 
tumor in 2021; 
Whereas an estimated 700,000 individuals are living with a 
brain tumor in the United States; 
Whereas in the United States, brain tumors are the— 
(1) leading cause of death from cancer in children 
who are under 14 years of age and teens who are under 
19 years of age; and 
(2) second leading cause of death from cancer in 
young adults who are between 15 and 39 years of age;

Whereas the average 5-year survival rate for an individual in 
the United States following the diagnosis of a primary 
malignant brain tumor is only 35.6 percent; 
Whereas it is estimated that 18,200 individuals in the United 
States will die as a result of a malignant brain tumor in 
2022; 
Whereas brain tumors may be malignant or benign but can 
be life-threatening in either case; 
Whereas, as of the date of introduction of this resolution, ap-
proximately 700,000 individuals in the United States are 
living with a brain tumor; 
Whereas treatment of brain tumors is complicated by the fact 
that more than 100 types of brain tumors exist; 
Whereas the treatment and removal of brain tumors present 
significant challenges due to the uniquely complex and 
fragile nature of the brain; 
Whereas brain tumors affect the primary organ in the human 
body that controls not only cognitive ability, but the ac-
tions of every other organ and limb in the body, leading 
to brain tumors being described as a disease that affects 
the whole individual; 
Whereas brain tumor research is supported by a number of 
private, nonprofit research foundations and by Federal 
medical research institutions; 
Whereas basic research may fuel advancements and develop-
ment of new treatments for brain tumors; 
Whereas obstacles to the development of new treatments for 
brain tumors remain, and there are limited strategies for 
the screening or early detection of brain tumors;

•HRES 1150 IH 
Whereas, despite the high number of individuals diagnosed 
with a brain tumor every year and the devastating prog-
noses for those individuals, only 5 drugs and 1 medical 
device are approved by the Food and Drug Administra-
tion to treat primary brain tumors; 
Whereas the mortality rates associated with brain tumors 
have changed little during the 30-year period preceding 
the date of introduction of this resolution; 
Whereas there is a need for greater public awareness of brain 
tumors, including the difficulties associated with research 
on brain tumors and the opportunities for advances in 
brain tumor research and treatment; and 
Whereas May 2022, during which brain tumor advocates na-
tionwide unite in awareness, outreach, and advocacy ac-
tivities, is an appropriate month to recognize as ‘‘Na-
tional Brain Tumor Awareness Month’’: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the designation of ‘‘National Brain 
2
Tumor Awareness Month’’; 
3
(2) encourages increased public awareness of 
4
brain tumors to honor the individuals who have lost 
5
their lives to a brain tumor or currently live with a 
6
brain tumor diagnosis; 
7
(3) supports efforts to develop better treat-
8
ments for brain tumors that will improve the quality 
9
of life and the long-term prognoses of individuals di-
10
agnosed with a brain tumor;
