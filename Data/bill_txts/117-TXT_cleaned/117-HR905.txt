RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the rise of cardiovascular disease as the world’s 
leading cause of preventable death and disability and 
as the global public health crisis of our generation and 
supporting the recognition of February 2022, as ‘‘Amer-
ican Heart Month’’. 
Whereas the World Health Organization estimates that in 
2019, 17,900,000 people died from cardiovascular dis-
eases (CVDs), representing 32 percent of all global 
deaths;

Whereas of these deaths, 85 percent were due to heart at-
tacks and strokes and over three-quarters of CVD deaths 
occur in low- and middle-income countries; 
Whereas CVDs result in tremendous health care costs and 
lost productivity and, if not addressed, the United States 
alone will spend over $1,000,000,000,000 by 2035 on 
costs relating to CVD; 
Whereas educational attainment, household income, residen-
tial environment, access to health care, and structural 
racism contribute significantly to disparities in CVD mor-
tality in the United States; 
Whereas the global COVID–19 pandemic poses significantly 
high risk to individuals with CVD and risk factors; 
Whereas the heavy burden of death and disability from CVDs 
can be decreased through changes in behavior linked to 
major risk factors, including reduced tobacco use and salt 
consumption, increased physical activity and proper nu-
trition, and improvements in access to medical treatment 
and services; 
Whereas heart disease remains the leading cause of death in 
the United States with deaths every 36.1 seconds, or 
2,396 deaths each day; 
Whereas 121,500,000 or 47 percent of United States adults 
have hypertension, a leading risk factor for heart attack 
and stroke; 
Whereas many women are not aware that CVD is the leading 
cause of death for women in the United States, taking 
the lives of over 420,812 women in 2019; 
Whereas CVD is the leading cause of maternal mortality in 
the United States, accounting for 1 in 3 pregnancy-re-
lated deaths;

•HRES 905 IH 
Whereas African Americans continue to experience the high-
est mortality rates attributable to CVD and stroke, with 
over half of all African-American adults with some form 
of CVD, including 58.8 percent of African-American 
women and 60.1 percent of African-American men; 
Whereas essential quality-assured medicines and technologies 
are critical components to address the global burden of 
CVDs; and 
Whereas United States leadership and support has strength-
ened surveillance, enhanced workforce capacity, and pro-
vided valuable technical exchanges in the area of CVD: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports recognition of ‘‘American Heart 
2
Month’’ to bring awareness to the cardiovascular 
3
disease (CVD) public health crisis in the United 
4
States and abroad; 
5
(2) recognizes and reaffirms the commitment of 
6
the United States to fighting CVD by— 
7
(A) promoting awareness about the causes, 
8
risks, and prevention of CVD; 
9
(B) supporting research on CVD, including 
10
disparities in CVD morbidity and mortality with 
11
respect to race, ethnicity, and other social de-
12
terminants of health; 
13
(C) equitably expanding access to afford-
14
able, quality care to reduce long-term disability 
15
and mortality; and

(D) strengthening the Nation’s public

health infrastructure to support prevention, 
2
preparedness, and responsiveness to ongoing 
3
threats to health;

(3) urges the deployment of United States tech-
5
nical expertise on CVDs in support of developing ca-
6
pacities and strengthening health care systems and 
7
public health infrastructure of other countries; 
8
(4) recognizes and supports efforts to address 
9
the long-term implications of the COVID–19 pan-
10
demic, including its influence on cardiovascular 
11
health and mortality rates; 
12
(5) calls on the Department of State, the 
13
United States Agency for International Develop-
14
ment, and the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
15
vention, to— 
16
(A) comprehensively examine the impact of 
17
CVDs on health and development in United 
18
States priority assistance countries; and 
19
(B) develop a coordinated strategy that im-
20
proves the effectiveness and impact of United 
21
States-financed global health programming by 
22
integrating CVD into existing programs;

and possessions of the United States, localities, non-

(7) encourages every individual in the United

States to learn about his or her risk for CVD.
