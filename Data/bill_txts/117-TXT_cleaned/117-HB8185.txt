Congress finds the following:

•HR 8185 IH
(1) In 2022, there will be more than 290,500 
1
new cases of invasive breast cancer and nearly 
2
44,000 breast cancer deaths in the United States. 
3
(2) In 2022, there will be about 14,100 new 
4
cases of invasive cervical cancer and about 4,280 
5
deaths from cervical cancer. 
6
(3) Black women have the highest breast, cer-
7
vical, and uterine cancer death rates of all racial and 
8
ethnic groups and are more likely to be diagnosed 
9
with triple-negative breast cancer, a more aggressive 
10
form of cancer. 
11
(4) Research shows that the COVID–19 pan-
12
demic was associated with a decline of more than 
13
3,900,000 breast cancer screenings in 2020, as com-
14
pared to 2019. Similarly, cervical cancer screening 
15
utilization dropped by 90 percent in April 2020, rel-
16
ative to the prior year. 
17
(5) Recent National Cancer Institute studies 
18
have estimated that pandemic-related disruptions or 
19
delays in breast care and screening are expected to 
20
result in an excess of 2,500 breast cancer deaths by 
21
2030. 
22
(6) Since its creation in 1991, the National 
23
Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Pro-
24
gram

‘‘NBCCEDP’’) 
has 
provided 
lifesaving 
cancer 
1
screening and diagnostic services to low-income, un-
2
insured, or underinsured women in all 50 States, the 
3
District of Columbia, 6 territories, and 13 Tribes or 
4
Tribal organizations. 
5
(7) NBCCEDP seeks to reduce inequities in 
6
breast and cervical cancer screening and diagnosis, 
7
placing special emphasis on outreach to women who 
8
are members of racial or ethnic minority groups, and 
9
those who are geographically or culturally isolated. 
10
(8) 
NBCCEDP 
has 
served 
more 
than 
11
6,000,000 
people 
and 
provided 
more 
than 
12
15,600,000 breast and cervical cancer screening ex-
13
aminations. 
14
(9) These screening exams have diagnosed over 
15
70,000 
invasive 
breast 
cancers 
and 
23,000 
16
premalignant breast lesions, as well as over 5,000 
17
invasive cervical cancers and 230,000 premalignant 
18
cervical lesions, of which 39 percent were high- 
19
grade. 
20
(10) The program also provides public edu-
21
cation, outreach, patient navigation, and care coordi-
22
nation to increase breast and cervical cancer screen-
23
ing rates and reach underserved populations.

(11) Reauthorizing NBCCEDP will result in 
1
expanded services, leading to more people being

screened and more cancers diagnosed at earlier

stages.
