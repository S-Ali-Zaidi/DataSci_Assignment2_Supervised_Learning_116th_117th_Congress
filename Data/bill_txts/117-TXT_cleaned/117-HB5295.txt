Congress finds the following:

•HR 5295 IH
(1) The Department of Veterans Affairs is re-
1
sponsible for providing a variety of benefits and 
2
services to more than 19,000,000 living veterans. 
3
(2) Pursuant to section 527 of title 38, United 
4
States Code, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs has 
5
conducted the National Survey of Veterans to assess 
6
the needs and sentiments of a statistically valid sam-
7
ple of all veterans. 
8
(3) The Secretary has conducted this National 
9
Survey of Veterans in the late 1970s, 1987, 1993, 
10
2001, and 2010. 
11
(4) The last survey conducted in 2010 included 
12
veterans and other beneficiary groups, such as mem-
13
bers of the Armed Forces serving on active duty, 
14
members of the reserve components of the Armed 
15
Forces, military spouses, and surviving spouses of 
16
such veterans and members. 
17
(5) The 2010 survey included information on 
18
demographics, awareness and utilization of benefits, 
19
health status, military service, and employment. 
20
(6) These surveys provide valuable information 
21
on the veteran population to the Secretary, Con-
22
gress, Federal, State, and local governments, aca-
23
demic institutions, and various non-governmental or-
24
ganizations that serve veterans.

•HR 5295 IH
(7) This information is used to inform policy-
1
making efforts and to ensure the needs of the ever- 
2
changing veteran population are met. 
3
(8) However, since 2010, the statutory frame-
4
work for data collection has substantially evolved, 
5
notably with the Foundations for Evidence-Based 
6
Policymaking Act (Public Law 115–435), the Data 
7
Act (Public Law 113–139), and the Geospatial Data 
8
Act (subtitle F of title VII of Public Law 115–254), 
9
known collectively as the ‘‘Evidence Act’’, building 
10
on previously enacted laws. 
11
(9) Further, the Department, through the Na-
12
tional Center for Veterans Analysis and Statistics, 
13
has leveraged the vast amount of data generated 
14
within the Department and collected by other Fed-
15
eral partners to improve population-based descrip-
16
tive, statistical, and predictive analytic products to 
17
support the Secretary and in evidence-based policy-
18
making, facilitate innovative and collaborative re-
19
search, and empower modern business intelligence 
20
applications. 
21
(10) The Department has been a consistent 
22
leader in the Federal Open Data program and offers 
23
a platform for scaling access to useful data and in-
24
sight to external stakeholders.

•HR 5295 IH
(11) Notwithstanding these recent advances, 
1
opportunities exist to strengthen the capability of 
2
the Department to develop and disseminate action-
3
able insights into the veteran population through— 
4
(A) developing enterprise-focused manage-
5
ment and improvements in the quality of ad-
6
ministrative data collected by the Department 
7
through its delivery of benefits and services; 
8
(B) increased access to data collected by 
9
other Federal entities through more flexible and 
10
efficient information sharing policies; 
11
(C) increased use of publicly available and 
12
commercially generated data; and 
13
(D) maturing data management of the De-
14
partment. 
15
(12) In line with the Evidence Act, it is incum-
16
bent upon the Secretary to regularly engage with 
17
key stakeholders, including Congress, veterans serv-
18
ice organizations, advocacy groups, and open govern-
19
ment groups to— 
20
(A) enhance the open data program of the 
21
Department; and 
22
(B) improve development and dissemina-
23
tion of relevant data assets and analytic prod-

ucts to provide more current, accurate, and use-
1
ful insights on veterans and their families. 
2
(13) It is necessary for the Department to col-
3
lect, collate, and analyze all available data on vet-
4
eran demographics, and to share this data with Con-
5
gress and other stakeholders on an ongoing basis, in 
6
an easily digestible format, to direct outreach and 
7
align policy with the needs of the changing veteran 
8
population.
