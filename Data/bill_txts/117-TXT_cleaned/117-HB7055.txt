Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Elijah E. Cummings

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) According to the Centers for Disease Con-
8
trol and Prevention, in 2017 more than 25,100,000

people in the United States had been diagnosed with 
1
asthma, including an estimated 6,200,000 children. 
2
(2) According to the Centers for Disease Con-
3
trol and Prevention, asthma usually affects racial 
4
and ethnic minorities, including African Americans, 
5
American Indians, Alaska Natives, Puerto Ricans, 
6
and people of multiple races more than non-Hispanic 
7
Whites. In 2017, Puerto Ricans and African Ameri-
8
cans had the highest lifetime prevalence of asthma 
9
at 20.6 and 15.2 percent, respectively. 
10
(3) According to the Centers for Disease Con-
11
trol and Prevention, among children, males have 
12
higher rates of asthma than females, and in adults 
13
women have higher rates of asthma than men. Indi-
14
viduals living below the poverty threshold also had 
15
significantly higher rates of asthma in 2017 than in-
16
dividuals living above the poverty threshold. 
17
(4) According to the Centers for Disease Con-
18
trol and Prevention, in 2017 more than 3,500 people 
19
in the United States died from asthma. The rate of 
20
mortality from asthma is higher among African 
21
Americans and women. 
22
(5) The Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
23
vention report that asthma accounted for approxi-
24
02:50 Mar 15, 2022

•HR 7055 IH
mately 180,000 hospitalizations and 1,800,000 visits 
1
to hospital emergency departments in 2016. 
2
(6) According to the Centers for Disease Con-
3
trol and Prevention, the annual cost of asthma to 
4
the 
United 
States 
is 
approximately 
5
$81,900,000,000, including $3,000,000,000 in indi-
6
rect costs from missed days of school and work. 
7
(7) According to the Centers for Disease Con-
8
trol and Prevention, 5,200,000 school days and 
9
8,500,000 work days are missed annually as a result 
10
of asthma. 
11
(8) Asthma episodes can be triggered by both 
12
outdoor air pollution and indoor air pollution, in-
13
cluding pollutants such as cigarette smoke and com-
14
bustion by-products. Asthma episodes can also be 
15
triggered by indoor allergens such as animal dander 
16
and outdoor allergens such as pollen and molds. 
17
(9) Public health interventions and medical care 
18
in accordance with existing guidelines have been 
19
proven effective in the treatment and management 
20
of asthma. Better asthma management could reduce 
21
the numbers of emergency department visits and 
22
hospitalizations due to asthma. Studies published in 
23
medical journals, including the Journal of Asthma 
24
and The Journal of Pediatrics, have shown that bet-
25
02:50 Mar 15, 2022
H7055

•HR 7055 IH
ter asthma management results in improved asthma 
1
outcomes at a lower cost. 
2
(10) In 2016, the Centers for Disease Control 
3
and Prevention reported that less than half of people 
4
with asthma reported receiving self-management 
5
training for their asthma. More education about 
6
triggers, proper treatment, and asthma management 
7
methods is needed. 
8
(11) The alarming rise in the prevalence of 
9
asthma, its adverse effect on school attendance and 
10
productivity, and its cost for hospitalizations and 
11
emergency room visits, highlight the importance of 
12
public health interventions, including increasing 
13
awareness of asthma as a chronic illness, its symp-
14
toms, the role of both indoor and outdoor environ-
15
mental factors that exacerbate the disease, and other 
16
factors that affect its exacerbations and severity. 
17
The goals of the Federal Government and its part-
18
ners in the nonprofit and private sectors should in-
19
clude reducing the number and severity of asthma 
20
attacks, asthma’s financial burden, and the health 
21
disparities associated with asthma. 
22
(12) The high health and financial burden 
23
caused by asthma underscores the importance of ad-
24
herence to the National Asthma Education and Pre-
25

vention Guidelines of the National Heart, Lung, and 
1
Blood Institute. Increasing adherence to guidelines- 
2
based care and resulting patient management prac-
3
tices will enhance the quality of life for patients with 
4
asthma and decrease asthma-related morbidity and 
5
mortality.
