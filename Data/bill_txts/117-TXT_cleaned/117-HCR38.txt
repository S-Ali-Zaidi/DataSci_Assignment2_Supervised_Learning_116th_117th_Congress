Expressing support for the NATO alliance and increased 
alliance cooperation on opportunities and challenges. 
Whereas the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) 
came into being through the North Atlantic Treaty, 
which entered into force on April 4, 1949, between the 
United States of America and the other founding mem-
bers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and has 
served as a pillar of international peace and stability, a 
critical component of United States security, and a deter-
rent against adversaries and external threats; 
Whereas Congress has repeatedly supported and affirmed

war, protecting the territorial integrity of its members, 
and seeing the Cold War through to a peaceful conclu-
sion; 
(2) NATO remains the foundation of United States 
foreign policy to promote a Europe that is whole, free, 
and at peace; 
(3) the United States is solemnly committed to the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s principle of collec-
tive defense as enumerated in Article 5 of the North At-
lantic Treaty; and 
(4) each alliance member ought to honor the deci-
sion at the NATO Wales Summit in 2014 to spend at 
least 2 percent of that country’s gross domestic product 
on defense by 2024; 
Whereas it is the policy of the United States— 
(1) to remain a member in good standing of NATO; 
(2) to continue to work with NATO members to 
meet their 2014 Wales Defense Investment Pledge com-
mitments; and 
(3) to support robust United States funding for the 
European Deterrence Initiative, which increases the abil-
ity of the United States and its allies to deter and defend 
against aggression; 
Whereas the United States should take every action to rein-
force its global reputation as a country that fully com-
plies with its obligations under the international treaties 
to which it is a party; and 
Whereas NATO was founded on the principles of democracy, 
individual liberty, and the rule of law: Now, therefore, be
