‘‘(a) DEFINITION OF GEOTHERMAL EXPLORATION 
2
TEST PROJECT.—In this section, the term ‘geothermal ex-
3
ploration test project’ means the drilling of a well to test 
4
or explore for geothermal resources on lands for which the 
5
Secretary has issued a lease under this Act, that— 
6
‘‘(1) is carried out by the holder of the lease; 
7
‘‘(2) causes— 
8
‘‘(A) less than 5 acres of soil or vegetation 
9
disruption at the location of each geothermal 
10
exploration well; and 
11
‘‘(B) not more than an additional 5 acres 
12
of soil or vegetation disruption during access or 
13
egress to the test site; 
14
‘‘(3) is developed— 
15
‘‘(A) less than 12 inches in diameter; 
16
‘‘(B) in a manner that does not require 
17
off-road motorized access other than to and 
18
from the well site along an identified off-road 
19
route; 
20
‘‘(C) without construction of new roads 
21
other than upgrading of existing drainage cross-
22
ings for safety purposes;

stimulation;

3
ing the removal of any surface infrastructure from

the site; and 
5
‘‘(5) requires the restoration of the project site 
6
within 3 years of the date of first exploration drilling 
7
to approximately the condition that existed at the 
8
time the project began, unless the site is subse-

quently used as part of energy development under 
10
the lease.

‘‘(b) CATEGORICAL EXCLUSION.— 
12
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—Unless extraordinary cir-
13
cumstances exist, a project that the Secretary deter-
14
mines under subsection (c) is a geothermal explo-
15
ration test project shall be categorically excluded 
16
from the requirements for an environmental assess-
17
ment or an environmental impact statement under 
18
the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42

shall not prepare any additional analysis under the Na-
7
tional Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321
