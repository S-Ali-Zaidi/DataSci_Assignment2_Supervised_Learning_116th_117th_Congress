Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
policies governing access to medication abortion care in

•HRES 589 IH 
the United States should be equitable and based on 
science. 
Whereas Congress has authorized the Food and Drug Admin-
istration (FDA) under section 505–1(a)(1) of the Federal 
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (42 U.S.C. 355–1(a)(1)) 
to impose Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies 
(REMS) where ‘‘necessary to ensure that the benefits of 
[a] drug outweigh the risks of the drug’’; 
Whereas mifepristone received FDA approval more than two 
decades ago, and according to the FDA, mifepristone’s 
‘‘efficacy and safety have become well-established by both 
research and experience, and serious complications have 
proven to be extremely rare’’; 
Whereas the REMS restrictions for mifepristone require that 
it be dispensed to patients in person, that health care 
providers who prescribe mifepristone receive certification 
before doing so, and that certified prescribers obtain a 
signed safety agreement from patients before dispensing 
mifepristone to them; 
Whereas of the more than 20,000 drugs the FDA regulates, 
mifepristone is the only drug that the FDA requires pa-
tients to obtain in person at a hospital, clinic, or medical 
office, but allows patients to self-administer unsupervised 
at home or at a location of their choosing; 
Whereas the FDA permits numerous drugs posing greater 
safety risks than mifepristone to be administered to pa-
tients without REMS restrictions; 
Whereas according to the American College of Obstetricians 
and 
Gynecologists, 
the 
REMS 
restrictions 
for 
mifepristone ‘‘have no medical basis, provide no patient 
benefit, and unnecessarily restrict access to care’’;

•HRES 589 IH 
Whereas the REMS restrictions for mifepristone are also op-
posed by the American Medical Association, the American 
Academy of Family Physicians, and other leading medical 
authorities; 
Whereas the World Health Organization recognizes that 
medication abortion plays a crucial role in the provision 
of access to safe, effective abortion care; 
Whereas lifting the in-person dispensing requirement and 
other REMS restrictions for mifepristone would improve 
access without weakening the strong safety profile of the 
drug; 
Whereas patients should be able to receive medication abor-
tion in the way that makes most sense for them from the 
provider of their choosing, whether that is at a health 
center, their local pharmacy, or delivered to their home; 
Whereas unnecessary restrictions on abortion, including medi-
cation abortion, disproportionately push care out of reach 
for people of color, people with lower incomes, those in 
rural communities, and other pregnant people who have 
been disproportionately harmed by burdensome and medi-
cally unnecessary State and Federal restrictions on abor-
tion care, as well as systemic inequities in health care 
that have been exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic; 
Whereas Congress required that any REMS not be ‘‘unduly 
burdensome on patient access to the drug, considering in 
particular . . . patients who have difficulty accessing 
health care (such as patients in rural or medically under-
served areas)’’, among other factors (section 505– 
1(f)(2)(C)(ii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
Act (42 U.S.C. 355–1(f)(2)(C)(ii)));

•HRES 589 IH 
Whereas, on April 12, 2021, the FDA announced that it 
would exercise enforcement discretion to temporarily lift 
the in-person dispensing requirement for mifepristone for 
the duration of the coronavirus public health emergency; 
and 
Whereas, on May 7, 2021, the FDA indicated that it is con-
ducting an evidence-based review of the REMS restric-
tions for mifepristone: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-
1
resentatives that policies governing access to medication 
2
abortion care in the United States should— 
3
(1) be grounded in science and based on a sci-
4
entific review of available medical evidence; and 
5
(2) ensure equitable access for patients harmed 
6
by restrictions that— 
7
(A) have impeded access to sexual and re-
8
productive health care; and 
9
(B) have worsened health disparities for 
10
people of color, immigrants, people with lower 
11
incomes, and people in other marginalized com-
12
munities.
