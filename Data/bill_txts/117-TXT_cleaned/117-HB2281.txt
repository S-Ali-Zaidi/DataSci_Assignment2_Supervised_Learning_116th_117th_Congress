SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
The Congress finds that— 
2
(1) a United States Army Dust Off crewman 
3
(pilot, crew chief, and medic) is a helicopter crew 
4
member who served honorably during the Vietnam 
5
War aboard a helicopter air ambulance often under 
6
the radio call sign ‘‘Dust Off’’; 
7
(2) Dust Off crews performed aeromedical evac-
8
uation for United States, Vietnamese, and allied 
9
forces in Southeast Asia from May 1962 through 
10
March 1973; 
11
(3) nearing the end of World War II, the 
12
United States Army began using helicopters for 
13
medical evacuation and years later, during the Ko-
14
rean War, these helicopter air ambulances were re-
15
sponsible for transporting 17,700 United States cas-
16
ualties; 
17
(4) during the Vietnam War, with the use of 
18
helicopter air ambulances, United States Army Dust 
19
Off crews pioneered the concept of dedicated and 
20
rapid medical evacuation and transported almost 
21
900,000 United States, South Vietnamese, and other 
22
allied sick and wounded, as well as wounded enemy 
23
forces; 
24
(5) helicopters proved to be a revolutionary tool 
25
to assist those injured on the battlefield; 
26

•HR 2281 IH
(6) highly skilled and intrepid, Dust Off crews 
1
were able to operate the helicopters and land them 
2
on almost any terrain in nearly any weather to pick 
3
up wounded, after which the Dust Off crews could 
4
provide care to these patients while transporting 
5
them to ready medical facilities; 
6
(7) the vital work of the Dust Off crews re-
7
quired consistent combat exposure and often proved 
8
to be the difference between life and death for 
9
wounded personnel; 
10
(8) the revolutionary concept of a dedicated 
11
combat life-saving system was cultivated and refined 
12
by United States Army Dust Off crews during 11 
13
years of intense conflict in and above the jungles of 
14
Southeast Asia; 
15
(9) innovative and resourceful Dust Off crews 
16
in Vietnam were responsible for taking the new con-
17
cept of helicopter medical evacuation, born just a 
18
few years earlier, and revolutionizing it to meet and 
19
surpass the previously unattainable goal of delivering 
20
a battlefield casualty to an operating table within 
21
the vaunted ‘‘golden hour’’; 
22
(10) some Dust Off units in Vietnam operated 
23
so efficiently that they were able to deliver a patient 
24
to a waiting medical facility on an average of 50 
25

minutes from the receipt of the mission, which saved 
1
the lives of countless personnel in Vietnam, and this 
2
legacy continues for modern-day Dust Off crews; 
3
(11) the inherent danger of being a member of 
4
a Dust Off crew in Vietnam meant that there was 
5
a 1 in 3 chance of being wounded or killed; 
6
(12) many battles during the Vietnam War 
7
raged at night, and members of the Dust Off crews 
8
often found themselves searching for a landing zone 
9
in complete darkness, in bad weather, over moun-
10
tainous terrain, and all while being the target of in-
11
tense enemy fire as they attempted to rescue the 
12
wounded, which caused Dust Off crews to suffer a 
13
rate of aircraft loss that was more than 3 times that 
14
of all other types of combat helicopter missions in 
15
Vietnam; 
16
(13) the 54th Medical Detachment typified the 
17
constant heroism displayed by Dust Off crews in 
18
Vietnam, over the span of a 10-month tour, with 
19
only 3 flyable helicopters and 40 soldiers in the unit, 
20
evacuating 21,435 patients in 8,644 missions while 
21
being airborne for 4,832 hours; 
22
(14) collectively, the members of the 54th Med-
23
ical Detachment earned 78 awards for valor, includ-
24
ing 1 Medal of Honor, 1 Distinguished Service

Cross, 14 Silver Star Medals, 26 Distinguished Fly-
1
ing Crosses, 2 Bronze Star Medals for valor, 4 Air 
2
Medals for valor, 4 Soldier’s Medals, and 26 Purple 
3
Heart Medals; 
4
(15) the 54th Medical Detachment displayed 
5
heroism on a daily basis and set the standard for all 
6
Dust Off crews in Vietnam; 
7
(16) 6 members of the 54th Medical Detach-
8
ment are in the Dust Off Hall of Fame, 3 are in the 
9
Army Aviation Hall of Fame, and 1 is the only 
10
United States Army aviator in the National Aviation 
11
Hall of Fame; 
12
(17) Dust Off crew members are among the 
13
most highly decorated soldiers in American military 
14
history; 
15
(18) in early 1964, Major Charles L. Kelly was 
16
the Commanding Officer of the 57th Medical De-
17
tachment (Helicopter Ambulance), Provisional, in 
18
Soc Trang, South Vietnam; 
19
(19) Major Kelly helped to forge the Dust Off 
20
call sign into history as one of the most welcomed 
21
phrases to be heard over the radio by wounded sol-
22
diers in perilous and dire situations; 
23
(20) in 1964, Major Kelly was killed in action 
24
as he gallantly maneuvered his aircraft to save a

wounded American soldier and several Vietnamese 
1
soldiers and boldly replied, after being warned to 
2
stay away from the landing zone due to the ferocity 
3
of enemy fire, ‘‘When I have your wounded.’’; 
4
(21) General William Westmoreland, Com-
5
mander, Military Assistance Command, Vietnam 
6
(1964–1968), singled out Major Kelly as an example 
7
of ‘‘the greatness of the human spirit’’ and high-
8
lighted his famous reply as an inspiration to all in 
9
combat; 
10
(22) General Creighton Abrams, Westmore-
11
land’s successor (1968–1972), and former Chief of 
12
Staff of the United States Army, highlighted the 
13
heroism of Dust Off crews, ‘‘A special word about 
14
the Dust Offs . . . Courage above and beyond the 
15
call of duty was sort of routine to them. It was a 
16
daily thing, part of the way they lived. That’s the 
17
great part, and it meant so much to every last man 
18
who served there. Whether he ever got hurt or not, 
19
he knew Dust Off was there.’’; 
20
(23) Dust Off crews possessed unique skills and 
21
traits 
that 
made 
them 
highly 
successful 
in 
22
aeromedical evacuation in Vietnam, including indom-
23
itable courage, extraordinary aviation skill and 
24
sound judgment under fire, high-level medical exper-

tise, and an unequaled dedication to the preservation 
1
of human life; 
2
(24) members of the United States Armed 
3
Forces on the ground in Vietnam had their con-
4
fidence and battlefield prowess reinforced knowing 
5
that there were heroic Dust Off crews just a few 
6
minutes from the fight, which was instrumental to 
7
their well-being, willingness to fight, and morale; 
8
(25) military families in the United States knew 
9
that their loved ones would receive the quickest and 
10
best possible care in the event of a war-time injury, 
11
thanks to the Dust Off crews; 
12
(26) the willingness of Dust Off crews to also 
13
risk their lives to save helpless civilians left an im-
14
measurably positive impression on the people of 
15
Vietnam and exemplified the finest American ideals 
16
of compassion and humanity; and 
17
(27) Dust Off crews from the Vietnam War 
18
hailed from every State in the United States and 
19
represented numerous ethnic, religious, and cultural 
20
backgrounds.
