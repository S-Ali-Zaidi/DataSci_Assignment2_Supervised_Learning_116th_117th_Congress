RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives in 
support of the International Atomic Energy Agency’s 
(IAEA) nuclear security role. 
Whereas the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), 
created in 1957 for the purpose of assisting states in the 
development and use of nuclear technology for peaceful 
purposes, plays a critical role in the global nuclear secu-
rity regime; 
Whereas the agency’s activities in nuclear security date back 
to the 1970s, when the agency began providing ad hoc 
training courses in physical protection; 
Whereas these responsibilities expanded following the collapse 
of the former Soviet Union, reports of nuclear smuggling

in the late 1990s, and again after the devastating terror 
attacks on September 11, 2001; 
Whereas the agency established the Nuclear Security Fund to 
assist countries in protecting their nuclear and radio-
logical materials and facilities; 
Whereas the agency’s nuclear security efforts are sustained 
by its technical expertise, experience, transparency, and 
confidentiality; 
Whereas rogue regimes and clandestine organizations con-
tinue to exhibit the ambition to acquire nuclear materials 
that can be used to build crude radiological and nuclear 
weapons; 
Whereas the IAEA Office of Nuclear Security relies almost 
exclusively on voluntary funding, which is inherently un-
predictable and inconsistent; and 
Whereas the 2016 Nuclear Security Summit in Washington, 
DC, issued an Action Plan on April 1, 2016, citing the 
agency’s need for ‘‘reliable and sufficient resources’’: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) maintains that the International Atomic 
2
Energy Agency (IAEA) plays an indispensable role 
3
in strengthening nuclear security and safety around 
4
the globe; 
5
(2) reaffirms that the United States has a vital 
6
interest in preventing the spread of nuclear weapons 
7
and securing nuclear materials; and
