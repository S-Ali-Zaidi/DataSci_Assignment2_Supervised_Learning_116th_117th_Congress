JOINT RESOLUTION 
Recognizing that Article I, Section 10 of the United States 
Constitution explicitly reserves to the States the sov-
ereign power to repel an invasion and defend their citi-
zenry from the overwhelming and ‘‘imminent danger’’ 
posed by paramilitary, narco-terrorist cartels who have 
seized control of our southern border. 
Whereas the Preamble to the United States Constitution out-
lines the chief responsibility of the Federal Government 
is to ‘‘insure domestic tranquility’’ and ‘‘provide for the 
common defense’’;

Whereas Article IV, Section 4 of the United States Constitu-
tion clearly states ‘‘The United States shall guarantee to 
every State in this Union a Republican Form of Govern-
ment, and shall protect each of them against Invasion’’; 
Whereas President Biden has continuously failed to uphold 
his oath and fulfil his Constitutional duty to ‘‘faithfully 
execute’’ the laws of the land; 
Whereas in the five months since President Biden took office, 
we have seen more apprehensions at the southern border 
than the entirety of the previous year; 
Whereas the 178,622 apprehensions in April marked a 20- 
year high and represented a 944-percent increase com-
pared to April 2020; 
Whereas those being apprehended have come from over 160 
nations, including individuals on the terrorist watch list; 
Whereas nearly 6,000 criminal offenses have already been 
committed by illegal immigrants in 2021, including as-
sault, homicide, illegal drug and contraband possession, 
trafficking, and sexual offenses; 
Whereas this represents a 140-percent increase in criminal 
offenses, with approximately 2,400 crimes committed by 
illegal immigrants in the entirety of 2020; 
Whereas Customs and Border Protection agents in the Del 
Rio sector have seen a more than 3,000-percent increase 
in arrests of convicted sex offenders compared to the pre-
vious year; 
Whereas authorities have already seized over 6,000 pounds of 
fentanyl—enough to kill every American four times 
over—in 2021, surpassing the 4,700 pounds seized in the 
entirety of 2020;

Whereas the United States has a drug epidemic whereby tens 
of thousands of Americans die every year and over 90 
percent of drugs, including heroin, methamphetamine, 
fentanyl, and cocaine, are smuggled across the southern 
border; 
Whereas cartels act as paramilitary, narco-terrorist organiza-
tions that profit from trafficking people and drugs into 
the United States; 
Whereas Customs and Border Protection agents have con-
firmed that cartels facilitate and profit from virtually 
every illegal border crossing; 
Whereas the Biden Administration has repeatedly removed 
effective measures that have reduced illegal immigration 
and secured the border, including Migrant Protection 
Protocols policy, a halt on border wall construction, a re-
instatement of ‘‘catch and release’’, a weakening of asy-
lum requirements, and countless other policy decisions 
that encourage a disregard for our laws and sovereignty 
and embolden cartels; 
Whereas the Federal Government has recognized since 1944 
the authority of the President to ‘‘prohibit, in whole or 
in part, the introduction of persons or property from 
such countries or places as he shall designate’’ as poten-
tially introducing or spreading a communicable disease, 
recently known as ‘‘Title 42’’; 
Whereas the Biden Administration has continuously acknowl-
edged the public health threat of COVID–19 but failed 
to fully enforce Title 42 to protect border communities 
and the entire nation against COVID–19 and its dan-
gerous new variants;

Whereas States along our southern border—Texas, New Mex-
ico, Arizona, and California—are forced to spend billions 
in their States’ taxpayer dollars to address and combat 
an unsecured border, as well as illegal border crossings 
and their associated adverse effects; 
Whereas State and local law enforcement entities are over-
whelmed by dangerous criminal activities associated with 
illegal border crossings, putting officers and their com-
munities in danger while draining local resources; and 
Whereas the quality of life and security of communities in 
border States are being threatened, including ranchers 
suffering from stolen and damaged property, healthcare 
providers with strained capacity, and educators strug-
gling to absorb the high volume of migrant children in 
classrooms: Now, therefore, be it
