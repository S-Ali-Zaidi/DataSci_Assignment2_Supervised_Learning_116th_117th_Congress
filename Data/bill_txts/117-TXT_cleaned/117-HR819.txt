SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
The House of Representatives finds the following: 
7
(1) On November 5, 2021, at 8:12 a.m., a 15- 
8
minute vote on a motion to adjourn was called that 
9
Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy

•HRES 819 IH 
Pelosi kept open for 7 hours and 6 minutes, the 
1
longest in the modern history of the House of Rep-
2
resentatives. 
3
(2) On November 5, 2021, at 3:43 p.m., a 15- 
4
minute vote on a question of consideration of the 
5
resolution was called that Speaker Nancy Pelosi kept 
6
open for 4 hours and 35 minutes. 
7
(3) While flexibility is important, the practice of 
8
keeping the House of Representatives tied up in a 
9
single vote indefinitely is unnecessary and prevents 
10
Members of the House from effectively meeting their 
11
multiple daily obligations to serve their constituents. 
12
(4) For the House of Representatives to func-
13
tion well, the vote schedule and length of votes must 
14
be clearly and accurately communicated to all Mem-
15
bers of the House to the furthest extent possible. 
16
(5) The ability to keep a vote open indefinitely 
17
is an enormous power grab by the Speaker, allowing 
18
the Speaker to halt all work on the House floor for 
19
as long as the Speaker wishes. It takes further 
20
power away from the Members of the House and 
21
centralizes it with House leadership.
