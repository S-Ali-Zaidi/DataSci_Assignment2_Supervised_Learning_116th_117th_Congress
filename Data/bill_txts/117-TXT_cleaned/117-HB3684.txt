(C) recently, the disparities cause by dis-

cluding congressional hearings and other inves-
13

9
mate conditions in planning, designing, building, oper-
10
ating, maintaining, investing in, and upgrading any feder-
11
ally funded transportation infrastructure investments. 
12
(b) METHODOLOGIES.—In conducting the study, the 
13
Transportation Research Board shall build on the meth-
14
odologies examined and recommended in— 
15
(1) the 2018 report issued the American Soci-
16
ety of Civil Engineers, titled ‘‘Climate-Resilient In-
17

•HR 3684 IH
(1) Integrating scientific knowledge of projected 
1
climate change impacts, and other relevant data and 
2
information, into Federal infrastructure planning, 
3
design, engineering, construction, operation and 
4
maintenance. 
5
(2) Addressing critical information gaps and 
6
challenges. 
7
(3) Financing options to help fund climate-resil-
8
ient infrastructure.

(4) A platform or process to facilitate commu-
10
nication between climate scientists and other experts 
11
with infrastructure planners, engineers and other 
12
relevant experts.

(8) Outlining how Federal infrastructure plan-
1
ning, design, engineering, construction, operation, 
2
and maintenance impact the environment and public 
3
health of disproportionately exposed communities. 
4
For purposes of this paragraph, the term ‘‘dis-
5
proportionately exposed communities’’ means a com-
6
munity in which climate change, pollution, or envi-
7
ronmental destruction have exacerbated systemic ra-
8
cial, regional, social, environmental, and economic 
9
injustices by disproportionately affecting indigenous 
10
peoples, communities of color, migrant communities, 
11
deindustrialized communities, depopulated rural 
12
communities, the poor, low-income workers, women, 
13
the elderly, people experiencing homelessness, people 
14
with disabilities, people who are incarcerated, or 
15
youth. 
16
(d) CONSIDERATIONS.—In carrying out the study, 
17
the Transportation Research Board shall determine the 
18
need for information related to climate resilient transpor-
19

21
barriers to integrating projected infrastructure risks 
22
posed by climate change into federal infrastructure

14
cading infrastructure failures and develop more ho-
15
listic approaches to evaluating and mitigating cli-
16
mate risks; 
17
(6) how to ensure that investments in infra-
18
structure resilience benefit all communities, includ-
19
ing communities of color, low-income communities 
20
and Indian Tribes that face a disproportionate risk 
21
from climate change and in many cases have experi-
22

(8) how federal agencies can track and monitor 
5
federally funded resilient infrastructure in a coordi-
6
nated fashion to help build the understanding of the 
7
cost-benefit of resilient infrastructure and to build 
8
the capacity for implementing resilient infrastruc-

(2) SENSE OF COMMITTEE ON NEED FOR RAIL 
10
TRUST FUND.—The following is the sense of the 
11
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of 
12
the House of Representatives: 
13
(A) There is a discrepancy in historical 
14
Federal investment between highways, aviation, 
15
and intercity passenger rail. Between 1949 and 
16
2017, the Federal Government invested more 
17
than $2 trillion in our nation’s highways and 
18
over $777 billion in aviation. The Federal Gov-
19
ernment has invested $96 billion in intercity 
20
passenger rail, beginning in 1971 with the cre-
21
ation of the National Railroad Passenger Cor-
22
poration. Intercity passenger rail Federal in-
23
vestment is only 12 percent of Federal aviation 
24

•HR 3684 IH
investment and less than 5 percent of Federal 
1
highway investment. 
2
(B) Congress has recognized the value and 
3
importance of a predictable, dedicated funding 
4
source through a trust fund for all other modes 
5
of transportation including for aviation, high-
6
ways, transit, and waterways. The Highway 
7
Trust Fund was created in 1956. The Airport 
8
and Aviation Trust Fund was created in 1970. 
9
The Inland Waterways Trust Fund was created 
10
in 1978. Mass transit was added to the High-
11
way Trust Fund in 1983. The Harbor Mainte-
12
nance Trust Fund was created in 1986. With 
13
regard to Federal transportation investment, 
14
only intercity passenger and freight rail do not 
15
have a predictable, dedicated funding source 
16
through a trust fund. 
17
(C) The Federal Railroad Administration 
18
has identified more than $300 billion worth of 
19
investment needed to develop both high-speed 
20
and higher speed intercity passenger rail cor-
21
ridors around the United States. In addition, a 
22
Federal Railroad Administration report from 
23
2014 found that shortline and regional rail-
24
roads need $7 billion of investment. The feder-
25

H3684
1062 
•HR 3684 IH
ally owned Northeast Corridor has a $40 billion 
1
state of good repair backlog. 
2
(D) A rail trust fund would provide a pre-
3
dictable, dedicated funding source to high-speed 
4
and intercity passenger rail projects and for the 
5
public benefits of shortline and regional railroad 
6
freight rail projects. A trust fund provides es-
7
sential longer term funding certainty to allow 
8
the United States to develop quality intercity 
9
passenger rail service in corridors across the 
10
country, eliminate the state of good repair 
11
backlog on the Northeast Corridor, allow for ac-
12
cessible equipment and stations for passengers 
13
with disabilities, move more freight on rail, re-
14
develop an American passenger rail car manu-
15
facturing base, create good paying, middle class 
16
jobs, and reduce our nation’s transportation 
17
carbon emissions.
