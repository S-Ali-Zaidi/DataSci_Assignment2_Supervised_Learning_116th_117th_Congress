CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of Congress that all direct and indirect 
subsidies that benefit the production or export of sugar 
by all major sugar-producing and -consuming countries 
should be eliminated. 
Whereas every major sugar-producing and sugar-consuming 
country in the world maintains some form of direct or in-
direct subsidy to support its sugar growers, processors, or 
consumers;

Whereas virtually all of the more than 100 countries that 
produce sugar maintain market-distorting subsidy pro-
grams, including— 
(1) the Government of Brazil which provides direct 
and indirect subsidies of at least $2,500,000,000 per year 
for programs to promote its sugar and ethanol industry 
and has increased subsidies in recent years in the form 
of preferential loans, debt forgiveness, and increased eth-
anol usage mandates; 
(2) the Government of India which provides at least 
$1,700,000,000 per year in subsidy supports to prop up 
its inefficient sugar industry, including the provision of 
export subsidies in 2014, 2015, 2018, 2019, and 2020 in 
potential violation of World Trade Organization obliga-
tions; 
(3) the Government of Thailand which more than 
tripled its sugar exports after 2004 by providing at least 
$1,300,000,000 in annual subsidies and government pro-
grams to its sugar industry and by maintaining domestic 
prices well above export prices; 
(4) the Governments of the European Union mem-
ber states which have provided support with an estimated 
value of $685,000,000 per year to their sugar farmers; 
(5) the Government of Russia which transformed its 
country from one of the world’s largest net importers of 
sugar to a net exporter on the basis of government sup-
port estimated at an estimated value of $392,000,000 per 
year from 2010 to 2017; and 
(6) the Government of Mexico which has generously 
supported its sugarcane growers, and was found guilty in 
2014 of injuring United States sugar producers by dump-
ing subsidized sugar into the United States market;

Whereas the world sugar market is the most volatile com-
modity market in the world; 
Whereas many countries routinely dump surplus sugar on the 
world sugar market, at prices below domestic price levels 
and costs of production; 
Whereas the foregoing clauses provide ample evidence there 
is no undistorted, free market in sugar in the world 
today; and 
Whereas, if such a free market did exist, United States sugar 
farmers and processors could compete effectively in that 
market: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate 
1
concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that— 
2
(1) the President should seek elimination of all 
3
direct and indirect subsidies benefiting the produc-
4
tion or export of sugar by the government of— 
5
(A) each country that exported more than 
6
200,000 metric tons of sugar in 2018, 2019, or 
7
2020; and 
8
(B) by any other country with which the 
9
United States has in effect a free trade agree-
10
ment; 
11
(2) if the President determines that all such 
12
subsidies by all such countries have been eliminated, 
13
the President should submit a report to Congress 
14
providing detailed information about how each of the 
15
countries has eliminated such subsidies; and
