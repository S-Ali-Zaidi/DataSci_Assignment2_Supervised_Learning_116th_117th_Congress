Capitol, and each person who works in or visits the 
1
complex depends on them for their safety. 
2
(2) In their dedication to provide this essential 
3
safety to the U.S. Capitol, numerous Capitol Police 
4
and other law enforcement have even paid with their 
5
lives while in the line of duty. 
6
(3) Those who have paid with their lives in the 
7
line of duty include Sergeant Christopher S. Eney in 
8
1984; Officer Jacob J. Chestnut and Detective John 
9
M. Gibson in 1998; and Sergeant Clinton J. Holtz 
10
in 2014. 
11
(4) Most recently, we mourn the losses of Cap-
12
itol Police Officers Brian Sicknick and Howard 
13
Liebengood, and Metropolitan Police Department 
14
Officer Jeffrey Smith, who all passed in January 
15
2021. We also mourn the loss of Officer William 
16
‘‘Billy’’ Evans, who was killed on April 2, 2021, 
17
while protecting the North Barricade of the Capitol. 
18
Officer Kenneth Shaver was also injured in that as-
19
sault. 
20
(5) The sacrifices made by each of these men 
21
are never forgotten in the U.S. Congress and by the 
22
many individuals who benefitted from their service. 
23
(6) The service and sacrifices of the Capitol Po-
24
lice should be recognized and honored.
