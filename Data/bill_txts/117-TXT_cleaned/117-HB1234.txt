A BILL 
To end the use of corporal punishment in schools, and for 
other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Ending Corporal Pun-
4
ishment in Schools Act of 2021’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Behavioral interventions for children must 
8
promote the right of all children to be treated with 
9

•HR 1234 IH
dignity. All children have the right to be free from 
1
any corporal punishment. 
2
(2) Safe, effective, evidence-based strategies are 
3
available to support children who display challenging 
4
behaviors in school settings. 
5
(3) School personnel have the right to work in 
6
a safe environment and should be provided training 
7
and support to prevent injury and trauma to them-
8
selves and others. 
9
(4) According to the Department of Education’s 
10
Technical Assistance Center on School-Wide Positive 
11
Behavior Interventions and Support, outcomes asso-
12
ciated with school-wide positive behavior support are: 
13
decreased office discipline referrals, increased in-
14
structional time, decreased administrator time spent 
15
on discipline issues, efficient and effective use of 
16
scarce resources, and increased perception of school 
17
safety and sustainability through a team approach. 
18
(5) Every 30 seconds during the school year, a 
19
public school student is corporally punished. 
20
(6) Nineteen States continue to permit corporal 
21
punishment in public schools. 
22
(7) According to Department of Education sta-
23
tistics, each year in the United States, hundreds of 
24
thousands of school children are subjected to cor-
25
22:59 Mar 20, 2021
H1234

•HR 1234 IH
poral punishment in public schools. School corporal 
1
punishment is usually executed in the form of ‘‘pad-
2
dling’’, or striking students with a wooden paddle on 
3
their buttocks or legs, which can result in abrasions, 
4
bruising, severe muscle injury, hematomas, whiplash 
5
damage, life-threatening hemorrhages, and other 
6
medical complications that may require hospitaliza-
7
tion. 
8
(8) Gross racial disparity exists in the execution 
9
of corporal punishment of public school children, and 
10
African-American schoolchildren are disproportion-
11
ately corporally punished. The most recent available 
12
statistics show that African-American students make 
13
up 18 percent of the national student population, 
14
but comprise 40 percent of all students subjected to 
15
physical punishment at school. Black children are 
16
nearly two-and-a-half times more likely to be cor-
17
porally punished than White children, and nearly 
18
eight times more likely to be corporally punished 
19
than Hispanic children. 
20
SEC. 3. PURPOSES. 
21
The purposes of this Act are to—
