OF
COMPETITION.—A

(3) 
FEDERAL
TRADE
COMMISSION
INDE-
7
PENDENT LITIGATION AUTHORITY.—If the Federal 
8
Trade Commission has reason to believe that a Cov-
9
ered Company violated this Act, the Federal Trade 
10
Commission may commence a civil action, in its own 
11
name by any of its attorneys designated by it for 
12
such purpose, to recover a civil penalty and seek 
13
other appropriate relief in a district court of the 
14
United States against the covered platform operator. 
15
(4) PARENS PATRIAE.—Any attorney general of 
16

17
State for a violation of this Act as parens patriae on

behalf of natural persons residing in such State, in 
19
any district court of the United States having juris-
20
diction of the defendant, and may secure any form 
21
of relief provided for in this section.

may sue therefor in any district court of the United 
1
States in the district in which the defendant resides 
2
or is found or has an agent, without respect to the 
3
amount in controversy, and shall recover threefold 
4
the damages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, 
5
including a reasonable attorney’s fee. The court may 
6
award under this subsection, pursuant to a motion 
7
by such developer promptly made, simple interest on 
8
actual damages for the period beginning on the date 
9
of service of such developer’s pleading setting forth 
10
a claim under this Act and ending on the date of 
11
judgment, or for any shorter period therein, if the 
12
court finds that the award of such interest for such 
13
period is just in the circumstances. In determining 
14
whether an award of interest under this subsection 
15
for any period is just in the circumstances, the court 
16
shall consider only— 
17
(A) whether such developer or the opposing 
18
party, or either party’s representative, made 
19
motions or asserted claims or defenses so lack-
20
ing in merit as to show that such party or rep-
21
resentative acted intentionally for delay, or oth-
22
erwise acted in bad faith; 
23
(B) whether, in the course of the action in-
24
volved, such developer or the opposing party, or

either party’s representative, violated any appli-
1
cable rule, statute, or court order providing for 
2
sanctions for dilatory behavior or otherwise pro-
3
viding for expeditious proceedings; and 
4
(C) whether such developer or the opposing 
5
party, or either party’s representative, engaged 
6
in conduct primarily for the purpose of delaying 
7
the litigation or increasing the cost thereof. 
8
(2) INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.—Any developer shall 
9
be entitled to sue for and have injunctive relief, in 
10
any court of the United States having jurisdiction 
11
over the parties, against threatened loss or damage 
12
by a violation of this Act, when and under the same 
13
conditions and principles as injunctive relief against 
14
threatened conduct that will cause loss or damage is 
15
granted by courts of equity, under the rules gov-
16
erning such proceedings, and upon the execution of 
17
proper bond against damages for an injunction im-
18
providently granted and a showing that the danger 
19
of irreparable loss or damage is immediate, a pre-
20
liminary injunction may issue. In any action under 
21
this paragraph in which the plaintiff substantially 
22
prevails, the court shall award the cost of suit, in-
23
cluding a reasonable attorney’s fee, to such plaintiff.
