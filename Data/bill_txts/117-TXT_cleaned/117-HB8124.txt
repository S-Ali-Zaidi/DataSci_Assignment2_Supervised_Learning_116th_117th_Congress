Congress finds the following:

•HR 8124 IH
(1) Solar cells were first invented in the United 
1
States in 1954 at Bell Labs. The United States 
2
went on to lead the world in the 1960’s and 1970’s 
3
in the development of this technology with the help 
4
of government-funded research and development and 
5
private research organizations. 
6
(2) In 2005, the State Council of the People’s 
7
Republic of China (PRC) identified solar power as a 
8
key strategic growth industry. The Chinese Govern-
9
ment subsequently poured billions of dollars into 
10
their solar industry and funded massive losses for 
11
solar companies to corner the global market. By 
12
2011, China’s share of global solar manufacturing 
13
exceeded 60 percent. 
14
(3) In October 2012, the Department of Com-
15
merce released its affirmative final determination 
16
that Chinese producers and exporters had been sell-
17
ing solar cells in the United States at dumping mar-
18
gins ranging from 18.32 to 249.96 percent. Com-
19
merce also determined that Chinese producers and 
20
exporters had received countervailable subsidies of 
21
14.78 to 15.97 percent. 
22
(4) In January 2018, the United States imple-
23
mented safeguard tariffs on solar cells and modules 
24
imported from China based on the investigations, 
25

findings, and recommendations of the independent, 
1
bipartisan U.S. International Trade Commission 
2
(ITC). 
3
(5) Several United States solar module manu-
4
facturers substantially increased production because 
5
of the 2018 tariffs on imported solar cells and mod-
6
ules. The ITC found that from, ‘‘2012 to 2016, the 
7
volume of solar generation capacity installed annu-
8
ally in the United States more than tripled, spurred 
9
on by artificially low-priced solar cells and modules 
10
from China’’. According to the ITC, in the same pe-
11
riod, ‘‘imports grew by approximately 500 percent, 
12
and prices dropped precipitously. Prices for solar 
13
cells and modules fell by 60 percent, to a point 
14
where most U.S. producers ceased domestic produc-
15
tion, moved their facilities to other countries, or de-
16
clared bankruptcy.’’. The ITC determined increased 
17
solar cell and module imports to be a substantial 
18
cause of serious injury to the domestic industry. 
19
(6) In the years since, the PRC has attempted 
20
to circumvent United States tariffs by shifting pro-
21
duction to Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, and Cam-
22
bodia, an issue the Department of Commerce is cur-
23
rently investigating.

(7) Renewable energy is among the key indus-
1
tries of the Chinese Communist Party’s Made in 
2
China 2025 strategic plan, and it is therefore crucial 
3
that Congress appropriate necessary funds and pur-
4
sue policies that drive innovation, encourage invest-
5
ment, and spur growth in this sector. 
6
(8) Made in China 2025 includes self-suffi-
7
ciency quotas that violate World Trade Organization 
8
rules against technology substitution. The PRC has 
9
repeatedly chosen to ignore free market norms and 
10
flout rules-based trade through foreign acquisitions, 
11
forced technology transfer agreements, and commer-
12
cial cyber espionage, in addition to other restrictive 
13
market practices. 
14
(9) The PRC has 64 percent of global produc-
15
tion capacity of polysilicon, a key raw material in 
16
the solar panel supply chain. Approximately half of 
17
China’s polysilicon production occurs in the western 
18
Xinjiang province, where the PRC relies on coal- 
19
fired power plants and forced Uyghur labor to ac-
20
count for about half of today’s global polysilicon out-
21
put. 
22
(10) The United States has recognized the on-
23
going genocide of the Uyghurs in Xinjiang and has 
24
prioritized combating forced labor with the over-

tion Act. 
3
(11) Over 1.3 million photovoltaic systems were 
4
installed in the United States in 2016, more than 
5
four times the level of 2012. The American solar in-
6
dustry employed approximately 249,983 people in 
7
the United States in 2019, a 167 percent increase 
8
from the number of people employed in the industry 
9
in 2010. 
10
(12) According to the Department of Energy, 
11
solar could account for as much as 40 percent of the 
12
Nation’s electricity supply by 2035 and 45 percent 
13
by 2050. 
14
(13) Significant majorities of Americans sup-
15
port the domestic manufacturing of solar panels, 
16
adding solar panel farms, and expanding the Buy 
17
American Act to further support United States do-
18
mestic solar manufacturers. Most Americans support 
19
expanding the Buy American Act so that the Fed-
20
eral Government is required to purchase renewable 
21
energy produced by equipment manufactured in the 
22
United States. 
23
(14) A resilient domestic solar supply chain will 
24
become increasingly vital to the economic, energy,

and national security of the United States. The solar 
1
energy used to power the Federal Government can-
2
not come from solar panels produced in coal-fired 
3
power plants, by forced labor, and shipped from the 
4
PRC. Expanding Buy American to include solar 
5
power purchase agreements will ensure that the re-
6
newable energy that powers the Federal Government 
7
comes from domestically manufactured solar panels.
