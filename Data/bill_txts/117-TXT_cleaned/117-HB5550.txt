SEC. 2. DEFINITION OF ESA. 
1
In this Act, the term ‘‘ESA’’ means the Endangered 
2
Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.). 
3
SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds that— 
5
(1) the ESA was passed in 1973 as a means of 
6
protecting and recovering species and has not been 
7
substantially revised in over 25 years; 
8
(2) the ESA has not achieved its stated goal of 
9
recovering threatened species or endangered species; 
10
(3) of the species listed in accordance with the 
11
ESA, less than 1 percent of the total number of spe-
12
cies in the United States have been recovered and 
13
removed from the list, largely due to data errors or 
14
other factors; 
15
(4) there is— 
16
(A) no comprehensive independent study of 
17
the costs or benefits of the ESA; 
18
(B) no full accounting of how much the 
19
Federal Government and State and local gov-
20
ernments spend to implement, enforce, and 
21
comply with the ESA; and 
22
(C) no meaningful effort to account for the 
23
costs the ESA imposes on the private sector; 
24
00:55 Oct 14, 2021
H5550
3 
•HR 5550 IH
(5) the ESA effectively penalizes landowners for 
1
owning endangered species habitat by forcing them 
2
to bear the cost of conservation; 
3
(6) the regulatory listing process under the 
4
ESA has become a tool for environmentalists to un-
5
dermine, slow down, or halt construction of infra-
6
structure projects, hampering economic growth and 
7
employment; and 
8
(7) litigation stemming from the ESA and some 
9
resulting settlements between the litigants and the 
10
Federal Government have made the ESA even more 
11
unworkable, to the detriment of species.
