RESOLUTION 
Calling for renewed, decisive, and robust international col-
laboration and coordination to fight COVID–19 across 
Africa. 
Whereas the World Health Organization (WHO) declared 
COVID–19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020, and by the 
end of that month, the virus had infected more than 
500,000 people and killed nearly 30,000; 
Whereas the first COVID–19 case on the African continent 
was recorded on February 14, 2020, in Egypt, and as of 
May 2020, the WHO’s modeling predicted that if con-
tainment measures failed, 29,000,000 to 44,000,000 Af-

ricans could be infected in the first year of the pandemic, 
with 83,000 to 190,000 deaths; 
Whereas, in early October 2020, a new COVID–19 variant 
was first detected in Nelson Mandela Bay, South Africa, 
and as of February 1, 2021, the South Africa variant 
had spread rapidly around the globe, including to the 
United States; 
Whereas COVID–19 is highlighting how interconnected our 
social, economic, and environmental challenges are, and 
the United States will not fully emerge from the pan-
demic until COVID–19 has been contained worldwide, in-
cluding in Africa; 
Whereas leaders across Africa acted swiftly in response to the 
early spread of COVID–19 cases, repurposing existing 
health protocols and tools from previous epidemic out-
breaks to fight COVID–19; 
Whereas the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Preven-
tion (Africa CDC) warned that shortages of health care 
professionals in African countries would devastate already 
fragile health care systems that are unable to meet the 
unprecedented demands of the COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas African countries have exhibited varying COVID–19 
infection rates and responses, and different testing prac-
tices and capabilities among the continent have likely 
contributed to significant underreporting of COVID–19 
confirmed cases and fatalities; 
Whereas, as of February 2021, South Africa had reported 
more than 1,460,000 cases (roughly 40 percent of the 
total African continent’s reported COVID–19 cases) and 
more than 49,000 COVID–19 related deaths (roughly 48

percent of the African continent’s reported COVID–19 
deaths); 
Whereas across the African continent, COVID–19 has com-
pounded existing education challenges, as schools have 
closed while limited access to electricity and technological 
gaps have hindered distance learning; 
Whereas responses to COVID–19 by some African govern-
ments have raised concerns about democratic backsliding, 
with some countries postponing elections and violently 
cracking down on citizens accused of violating lockdown 
orders; 
Whereas according to the WHO, women and girls in Africa 
are likely to be the hardest hit by health, social, and eco-
nomic consequences of COVID–19, and women and girls 
may face a ‘‘shadow pandemic’’ of domestic violence, 
forcing large numbers of girls into early marriage and re-
sulting in increased sexual violence and higher rates of 
unplanned pregnancies; 
Whereas the WHO and the United Nations International 
Children’s Emergency Fund have warned of an alarming 
decline in the number of children receiving lifesaving vac-
cines in Africa and elsewhere around the world, and so-
cial distancing and lockdowns to control the spread of 
COVID–19 have disrupted vaccination campaigns, as well 
as prevention and treatment programs, including those to 
treat and prevent HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria; 
Whereas aid disruptions and rising food prices linked to the 
COVID–19 
crisis 
are 
increasing 
the 
needs 
and 
vulnerabilities of refugees and internally displaced people 
across Africa, leading to even greater food insecurity for 
millions; 
02:41 Mar 18, 2021

•HRES 245 IH 
Whereas the World Food Programme estimated that in 
Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger, food insecurity rose by 
1,000,000 to 4,800,000 since the start of the COVID–19 
pandemic, and ongoing conflicts, mass displacement, 
droughts, and locust infestations have further contributed 
to severe food insecurity in parts of Africa; 
Whereas Africa’s youth are playing a crucial role to help their 
communities by fighting misinformation and leading cam-
paigns to fight COVID–19; for example, in Nigeria, a 
young man disseminated accurate information about the 
pandemic in more than 60 local languages, and in the 
eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, youth activ-
ists went door-to-door distributing informational pam-
phlets on how to stop the spread of COVID–19; 
Whereas many migrants and their families rely on remit-
tances as a source of income, and the Brookings Institu-
tion reports that remittance to Sub-Saharan Africa will 
decline by 5.8 percent to $41,000,000,000 in 2021 com-
pared to $44,000,000,000 in 2020 and $48,000,000,000 
in 2019; and 
Whereas there is a need for a renewed, strategic, and focused 
approach to United States policy toward Africa, and by 
focusing United States efforts, working respectfully with 
our allies, strategic partners, and other stakeholders, and 
mitigating future economic and security impacts stem-
ming from COVID–19, the United States can protect Af-
rica and the rest of the world’s health economic security: 
Now, therefore, be it
