SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds that— 
2
(1) according to the Department of Justice, 
3
every year, over 600,000 individuals are released 
4
from prison and return home to their communities, 
5
and almost 77 percent of those individuals will re-
6
offend within 5 years; 
7
(2) according to the Center for American 
8
Progress, an estimated 60 percent of formerly incar-
9
cerated individuals will remain unemployed for a pe-
10
riod of 1 year post-incarceration, increasing the risk 
11
for recidivism; 
12
(3) according to the Center for Economic and 
13
Policy Research, the economy of the United States 
14
loses 
an 
estimated 
$78,000,000,000 
to 
15
$87,000,000,000 annually due to lost output from 
16
individuals with criminal records unable to find sta-
17
ble employment; 
18
(4) entrepreneurial development programs for 
19
incarcerated and formerly incarcerated individuals 
20
report dramatically lower rates of recidivism; and 
21
(5) self-employment can provide economic sta-
22
bility for those who are otherwise locked out of the 
23
labor market.
