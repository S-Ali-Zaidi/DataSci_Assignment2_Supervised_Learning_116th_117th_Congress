RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for viewing women’s health as a critical 
issue for the economy and workforce of the United States 
and for advancing the health and well-being of all people. 
Whereas women constitute 50.8 percent of United States citi-
zens and nearly 1⁄2 of the workforce in the United States; 
Whereas women control 60 percent of personal wealth and 
are responsible for 85 percent of consumer spending and 
80 percent of health care decisions; 
Whereas, across races, ethnicities, socioeconomic statuses, 
disability statuses, and age groups—

(1) women experience many diseases and disorders 
differently than men; 
(2) the incidence, prevalence, symptomology, and se-
verity of disease may differ between men and women; 
(3) women vary in the risks of certain diseases and 
the benefits of medical therapies; and 
(4) for many years, women were underrepresented in 
biomedical and clinical research; 
Whereas longer life spans of women require the need for re-
search on the health of older women; 
Whereas women and men have fundamental biological dif-
ferences at the cellular level; 
Whereas 2⁄3 of patients with Alzheimer’s disease are women; 
Whereas heart disease is the leading cause of death in 
women, and women are 50 percent more likely to die the 
year following a heart attack than men; 
Whereas 80 percent of patients with autoimmune diseases are 
women; 
Whereas women have more stroke events and are less likely 
to recover from such events than men; 
Whereas there are significant sex and age differences between 
men and women with respect to drug administration and 
dosage; 
Whereas older women are more prone to having multiple 
medical problems and, as a result, may be taking incor-
rectly prescribed medications due to lack of information 
on gender and age differences; 
Whereas, on January 25, 2016, the National Institutes of 
Health implemented a policy requiring federally funded

investigators to consider sex as a biological variable in 
preclinical research; 
Whereas such policy has improved inclusivity in women’s 
health research, but disparities still remain; 
Whereas the 2021 report entitled ‘‘The Case to Fund Wom-
en’s Health Research: An Economic and Societal Impact 
Analysis’’, published by Women’s Health Access Matters 
(commonly known as the ‘‘WHAM Report’’), states that 
in 2019, of the funding provided by the National Insti-
tutes of Health, 12 percent of the funding for Alz-
heimer’s research, 4.5 percent of the funding for coro-
nary artery disease research, and 7 percent of the fund-
ing for rheumatoid arthritis research focused on women; 
Whereas this research gap has had economic consequences, 
including— 
(1) pushing women out of the workforce to care for 
their own health or to act as caregivers; and 
(2) contributing to increased costs of health care be-
cause of delays in care; 
Whereas the improvement of women’s health relies on sex- 
and gender-based biomedical and clinical research; 
Whereas the promise of personalized medicine cannot be real-
ized without sex- and gender-based parity in research; 
Whereas the WHAM Report states that small investments in 
women’s health research will bring larger returns to the 
economy and add productive years to the workforce of 
the United States; and 
Whereas the WHAM Report shows that doubling current 
funding focused on women across Alzheimer’s disease, 
coronary artery disease, and rheumatoid arthritis is a 
$300,000,000 
investment

women, particularly for diseases that differen-

(B) to double the current share of women’s

research focused on Alzheimer’s disease (12
