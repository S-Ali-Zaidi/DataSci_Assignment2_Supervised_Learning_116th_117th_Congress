its impeachment against him for abuse of power by ena-

ARTICLE I: ABUSE OF POWER 
3
The Constitution provides that the House of Rep-
4
resentatives ‘‘shall have the sole Power of Impeachment’’ 
5
and that the President ‘‘shall be removed from Office on 
6
Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or 
7
other high Crimes and Misdemeanors’’. 
8
In his conduct as the former Vice President and cur-
9
rent President of the United States, in violation of his con-
10
stitutional oath faithfully to execute the offices of the Vice 
11
Presidency and President of the United States, and, to 
12
the best of his ability, preserve, protect, defend, the Con-
13
stitution of the United States, and in violation of his con-
14
stitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully 
15
executed—Joseph Robinette Biden abused the power of 
16
the Office of the Vice President, enabling bribery and 
17
other high crimes and misdemeanors, by allowing his son 
18
to influence the domestic policy of a foreign nation and 
19
accept various benefits—including financial compensa-
20
tion—from foreign nationals in exchange for certain fa-
21
vors. 
22
As Vice President, Joseph Biden was the senior 
23
Obama Administration official overseeing anti-corruption 
24
efforts in Ukraine. Hence, any illegal activity involving 
25

corruption conducted by Hunter Biden within or in rela-
1
tion to Ukraine would fall under the purview of the Office 
2
of Vice President Biden and the Obama State Depart-
3
ment’s anti-corruption efforts. In fact, many State De-
4
partment officials within the Obama Administration re-
5
peatedly registered reservations about Hunter Biden’s role 
6
on the board of a corrupt company. Thus, any instances 
7
of corruption on behalf of Hunter Biden via his role as 
8
a board member of the Ukrainian-operated Burisma en-
9
ergy firm were either not investigated or covered up. The 
10
evidence of widespread knowledge, corruption, and collu-
11
sion on behalf of the Biden family with foreign nationals 
12
is clear and compelling. 
13
Among other examples, it has been materially dem-
14
onstrated that: 
15
(1) According to the U.S. Senate Committee on 
16
Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and 
17
the U.S. Senate Committee on Finance, the Vice 
18
President’s office and State Department officials 
19
were aware but ignored concerns relating to Hunter 
20
Biden’s role on the board of a Ukrainian-based nat-
21
ural gas company (hereafter, ‘‘Burisma’’). 
22
(2) According to the same sources, Hunter 
23
Biden’s and his family’s financial transactions with 
24

•HRES 57 IH 
Ukrainian, Russian, Kazakh, and Chinese nationals 
1
raise criminal concerns and extortion threats. 
2
(3) In early 2015 the former Acting Deputy 
3
Chief of Mission at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, 
4
Ukraine, George Kent, raised concerns to officials in 
5
Vice President Joe Biden’s office about the percep-
6
tion of a conflict of interest with respect to Hunter 
7
Biden’s role on Burisma’s board. Kent’s concerns 
8
went unaddressed, and in September 2016, he em-
9
phasized in an email to his colleagues, ‘‘Further-
10
more, the presence of Hunter Biden on the Burisma 
11
board was very awkward for all U.S. officials push-
12
ing an anticorruption agenda in Ukraine.’’. 
13
(4) In October 2015, senior State Department 
14
official Amos Hochstein raised concerns with Vice 
15
President Biden, as well as with Hunter Biden, that 
16
Hunter Biden’s position on Burisma’s board enabled 
17
Russian disinformation efforts and risked under-
18
mining U.S. policy in Ukraine. Vice President Biden 
19
did not resolve this conflict of interest. Instead, he 
20
enabled it. 
21
(5) In addition to the over $4 million paid by 
22
Burisma for Hunter Biden’s board membership, 
23
Hunter Biden, and his family received millions of 
24
dollars from foreign nationals with questionable 
25

backgrounds. Specifically, the ongoing FBI inves-
1
tigation into Hunter Biden’s laptop revealed that 
2
Hunter received a 2.8 carat diamond gift from a 
3
high-ranking Chinese official in 2017. Hunter Biden 
4
told the New Yorker Magazine that he ‘‘felt uncom-
5
fortable receiving the diamond and gave it to other 
6
associates’’. 
7
(6) Hunter Biden had business associations 
8
with Ye Jianming, founder of the CEFC China En-
9
ergy Company, Ltd., Gongwen Dong, and other Chi-
10
nese nationals linked to the Communist government 
11
and the People’s Liberation Army. Those associa-
12
tions resulted in millions of dollars in cash flow. 
13
There exists a vast web of corporate connections and 
14
financial transactions between and among the Biden 
15
family and Chinese nationals. 
16
(7) Hunter Biden paid nonresident women who 
17
were nationals of Russia or other Eastern European 
18
countries and who appear to be linked to an ‘‘East-
19
ern European prostitution or human trafficking 
20
ring’’. 
21
(8) In 2016, Ukraine’s top anti-corruption pros-
22
ecutor, Viktor Shokin, had an active and ongoing in-
23
vestigation into Burisma and its owner, Mykola 
24
Zlochevsky. At the time, Hunter Biden continued to

serve on Burisma’s board of directors. According to 
1
news reports, then Vice-President Biden ‘‘threatened 
2
to withhold $1 billion in United States loan guaran-
3
tees if Ukraine’s leaders did not dismiss [Shokin]’’. 
4
After that, Ukraine’s Parliament fired Shokin. 
5
(9) Hunter Biden received millions of dollars 
6
from foreign sources as a result of business relation-
7
ships that he built during the period when his father 
8
was Vice President of the United States and after. 
9
The financial transactions which Hunter engaged in 
10
illustrate serious counterintelligence and extortion 
11
concerns relating to Hunter Biden and his family. 
12
(10) Hunter Biden’s work with Chinese nation-
13
als connected to the Communist regime illustrate the 
14
deep financial connections that accelerated while his 
15
father was Vice President and continued after he 
16
left office. 
17
(11) On June 23, 2011, Sean Conlon, a busi-
18
ness associate of Hunter Biden, suggested that a 
19
$10 billion deal could be struck in exchange for cer-
20
tain persons meeting Vice President Biden. This 
21
shows deliberate ‘‘pay-for-play’’ and ‘‘quid-pro-quo’’.

The email, in full, to Robert Biden, from Sean 
23
Conlon, is as follows:

(A) ‘‘So we have engagement letter if they

3
he talked to his professor and these get traded.

We get 10% in fees. We need to get these guys

we can do that. V brief. If Nagi get that done 
9
we get more bonds to move. Regards your hard 
10

11
added). 
12
(12) Emails between Hunter Biden and his 
13
cousin reveal that the President of Hunter’s Chinese 
14
Communist Party-linked firm, Eric Schwerin, re-
15
peatedly asked Hunter for an appointment to the 
16
Commission for the Preservation of America’s Herit-
17
age Abroad—a position he ultimately received. The 
18
email from Hunter to his cousin, Missy, regarding 
19
the request for the appointment to the Commission 
20
is as follows: 
21
(A) ‘‘Eric asked for one of these [an ap-
22
pointment] the day after the election in 2008. 
23

24
teresting appointments. Let’s go through the

list with Steve and see what makes sense. I 
1
don’t know how much 2016 and nepotism plays 
2
into it.’’. 
3
In all of this, President Biden gravely endangered the 
4
security of the United States and its institutions of gov-
5
ernment. Through blatant nepotism, he enabled his son 
6
to influence foreign policy and financially benefit as a re-
7
sult of his role as Vice President. He supported his son 
8
engaging in collusion with Chinese Communist Party- 
9
linked officials. He allowed his son to trade appointments 
10
with his father and other high-ranking administration offi-
11
cials in exchange for financial compensation. He permitted 
12
his son to take money from Russian oligarchs, including 
13
Elena Baturina, the wife of the former mayor of Moscow. 
14
In so doing, Joseph R. Biden threatened the integrity 
15
of the democratic system, interfered with the peaceful 
16
transition of power, and imperiled a coordinate branch of 
17
government. He thereby betrayed his trust as former Vice 
18
President and current President, to the manifest injury 
19
of the people of the United States. 
20
Wherefore President Biden, by such conduct, has 
21
demonstrated that he will remain a threat to national se-
22
curity, democracy, and the Constitution if allowed to re-
23
main in office, and has acted in a manner grossly incom-
24
patible with self-governance and the rule of law. President

of honor, trust, or profit under the United States.
