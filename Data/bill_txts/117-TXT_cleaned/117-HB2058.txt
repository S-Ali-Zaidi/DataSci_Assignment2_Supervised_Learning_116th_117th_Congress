A BILL 
To establish the Steel Valley National Heritage Area in 
the States of Pennsylvania and Ohio, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Steel Valley National 
4
Heritage Area Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds as follows: 
7
(1) Until the late 1970s, the Mahoning Valley 
8
Steelmaking District was one of the five largest 
9
steelmaking areas in the world, at times even larger 
10

than Pittsburgh, and its mills produced the steel 
1
that built America’s cities, supported its infrastruc-
2
ture, and strengthened its war efforts. 
3
(2) Jobs in the steel industry attracted immi-
4
grants from Europe, Latin America, and the Middle 
5
East, as well as thousands of African Americans 
6
moving North as part of the Great Migration. While 
7
these groups have interacted, become neighbors, and 
8
intermarried over the decades, ethnic identities re-
9
main strong in this area. This has produced both a 
10
strong sense of community and divisions that reflect 
11
national patterns of conflict over class, race, eth-
12
nicity, and religion. 
13
(3) The cultural legacy of the steel industry re-
14
mains long after many of the local mills shut down 
15
in the institutions created by both working people 
16
and civic and business leaders, ranging from ethnic 
17
churches to adult education programs aimed at help-
18
ing immigrants learn English and gain citizenship to 
19
the Butler Institute of America Art, the Youngstown 
20
Symphony, several museums focused on the history 
21
of the region, and a large city park that offers pro-
22
gramming in the arts, history, and outdoor activi-
23
ties.

•HR 2058 IH
(4) The Mahoning Valley Steelmaking District 
1
has a long history of labor and community activ-
2
ism— 
3
(A) helping to create the United Steel-
4
workers of America, which enabled many work-
5
ers to achieve middle-class lives; 
6
(B) organizing a significant community- 
7
wide effort to keep the steel mills open after 
8
shutdowns were announced in the late 1970s; 
9
and 
10
(C) developing a nationally and inter-
11
nationally recognized model for community- 
12
based planning in response to the economic and 
13
social challenges of deindustrialization, includ-
14
ing the Youngstown 2010 Plan and several on- 
15
going grassroots neighborhood organizations 
16
that have led important efforts to revitalize the 
17
community. 
18
(5) While many aspects of this community’s 
19
history reflect the unique mix of the people who 
20
came here and the history of industries in this Val-
21
ley, the story of the Mahoning Valley Steelmaking 
22
District also reflects national patterns of industrial 
23
growth and change, migration and immigration, and 
24
cultural, civic, and labor organizing.
