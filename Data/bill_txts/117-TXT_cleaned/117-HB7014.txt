SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The United States is a founding member of 
3
the World Trade Organization (WTO) and is com-
4
mitted to ensuring that the WTO remains an effec-
5
tive forum for peaceful economic engagement. 
6
(2) Ukraine is a sovereign nation-state that is 
7
entitled to enter into agreements with other sov-
8
ereign states and to full respect of its territorial in-
9
tegrity. 
10
(3) The United States will be unwavering in its 
11
support for a secure, democratic, and sovereign 
12
Ukraine, free to choose its own leaders and future. 
13
(4) Ukraine acceded to the Marrakesh Agree-
14
ment Establishing the World Trade Organization 
15
(WTO Agreement) and has been a WTO member 
16
since 2008. 
17
(5) Ukraine’s participation in the WTO Agree-
18
ment creates both rights and obligations vis-a`-vis 
19
other WTO members. 
20
(6) The Russian Federation acceded to the 
21
WTO on August 22, 2012, becoming the 156th 
22
WTO member, and the Republic of Belarus has ap-
23
plied to accede to the WTO.

•HR 7014 IH
(7) From the date of its accession, the Russian 
1
Federation committed to apply fully all provisions of 
2
the WTO. 
3
(8) The United States Congress authorized per-
4
manent normal trade relations for the Russian Fed-
5
eration through the Russia and Moldova Jackson- 
6
Vanik Repeal and Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law 
7
Accountability Act of 2012 (Public Law 112–208). 
8
(9) Ukraine communicated to the WTO General 
9
Council on March 2, 2022, urging that all WTO 
10
members take action against the Russian Federation 
11
and ‘‘consider further steps with the view to sus-
12
pending the Russian Federation’s participation in 
13
the WTO for its violation of the purpose and prin-
14
ciples of this Organization’’. 
15
(10) Vladimir Putin, a ruthless dictator, has led 
16
the Russian Federation into a war of aggression 
17
against Ukraine, which— 
18
(A) denies Ukraine and its people their col-
19
lective rights to independence, sovereignty, and 
20
territorial integrity; 
21
(B) constitutes an emergency in inter-
22
national relations, because it is a situation of 
23
armed conflict that threatens the peace and se-
24

•HR 7014 IH
curity of all countries, including the United 
1
States; and 
2
(C) denies Ukraine its rightful ability to 
3
participate in international organizations, in-
4
cluding the WTO. 
5
(11) The Republic of Belarus, also led by a 
6
ruthless dictator, Aleksander Lukashenka, is pro-
7
viding important material support to the Russian 
8
Federation’s aggression. 
9
(12) The Russian Federation’s exportation of 
10
goods in the energy sector is central to its ability to 
11
wage its war of aggression on Ukraine. 
12
(13) The United States, along with its allies 
13
and partners, has responded to recent aggression by 
14
the Russian Federation in Ukraine by imposing 
15
sweeping financial sanctions and stringent export 
16
controls. 
17
(14) The United States cannot allow the con-
18
sequences of the Russian Federation’s actions to go 
19
unaddressed, and must lead fellow countries, in all 
20
fora, including the WTO, to impose appropriate con-
21
sequences for the Russian Federation’s aggression.
