of military service or combat-related special compensa-

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Retired Pay Restora-
2
tion Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
4
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) For more than 100 years before 1999, all 
6
disabled military retirees were required to fund their 
7
own veterans’ disability compensation by forfeiting 
8
one dollar of earned retired pay for each dollar re-
9
ceived in veterans’ disability compensation. 
10
(2) Since 1999, Congress has enacted legisla-
11
tion to progressively expand eligibility criteria for re-
12
lief of the retired pay disability offset and reduce the 
13
burden of financial sacrifice on disabled military re-
14
tirees. 
15
(3) Absent adequate funding to eliminate the 
16
sacrifice for all disabled retirees, Congress has given 
17
initial priority to easing financial inequities for the 
18
most severely disabled and for combat-disabled retir-
19
ees. 
20
(4) In the interest of maximizing eligibility 
21
within cost constraints, Congress effectively has au-
22
thorized full concurrent receipt for all qualifying re-
23
tirees with 100-percent disability ratings and all 
24
qualifying retirees with combat-related disability rat-
25
ings, while phasing out the disability offset to retired 
26

•HR 303 IH
pay over 10 years for retired members with noncom-
1
bat-related, service-connected disability ratings of 50 
2
percent to 90 percent. 
3
(5) In pursuing these good-faith efforts, Con-
4
gress acknowledges the regrettable necessity of cre-
5
ating new thresholds of eligibility that understand-
6
ably are disappointing to disabled retirees who fall 
7
short of meeting those new thresholds. 
8
(6) Congress is not content with the status quo. 
9
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
10
gress that military retired pay earned by service and sac-
11
rifice in defending the United States should not be re-
12
duced because a military retiree is also eligible for vet-
13
erans’ disability compensation awarded for service-con-
14
nected disability.
