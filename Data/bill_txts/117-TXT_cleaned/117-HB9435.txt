•HR 9435 IH
(1) Trust between the Kingdom of Saudi Ara-
1
bia and the United States has been eroded by the 
2
devastating humanitarian costs of the war in Yemen, 
3
the kidnappings and shakedowns of royals and other 
4
businessmen in the Riyadh Ritz-Carlton, the murder 
5
of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, and the torture of 
6
women activists seeking equal rights. 
7
(2) Fifteen of the September 11, 2001, 
8
attackers were Saudi citizens, nationals, or of Saudi 
9
descent and some of these individuals had direct as-
10
sistance from the Saudi Government for training, 
11
logistical support, and radicalization. 
12
(3) Mohammed Alshamrani, a 21-year-old sec-
13
ond lieutenant in the Royal Saudi Air Force who 
14
was radicalized by al-Qa‘ida in the Arabian Penin-
15
sula (AQAP) and Osama bin Laden’s teachings of 
16
Wahhabiism, fatally shot Cameron Walters, 21, Mo-
17
hammed Sameh Haitham, 19, Joshua Kaleb Wat-
18
son, 23, and wounded eight others, including two 
19
sheriff’s deputies, at Naval Air Station Pensacola in 
20
Florida on December 6, 2019, in an act of 
21
unprovoked and cowardly terror. 
22
(4) Al-Shamrani was a Trojan Horse sent by 
23
his country, Saudi Arabia, and the Saudi authorities 
24
were negligent in properly screening Al-Shamrani.
