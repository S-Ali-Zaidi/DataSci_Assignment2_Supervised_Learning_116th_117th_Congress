SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress makes the following findings: 
7
(1) Since 1988, the United States policy of 
8
principled engagement has fostered positive demo-
9
cratic reforms in Burma, with elections in 2010, 
10
2015, and 2020, helping to bring about the partial 
11
transition to civilian rule and with the latter 2 elec-
12
tions resulting in resounding electoral victories for 
13
the National League for Democracy. 
14
(2) That democratic transition remained incom-
15
plete, with the military retaining significant power 
16
and independence from civilian control following the 
17
2015 elections, including through control of 25 per-
18
cent of parliamentary seats, a de facto veto over con-
19
stitutional reform, authority over multiple govern-
20
ment ministries, and the ability to operate with im-
21
punity and no civilian oversight. 
22
(3) Despite some improvements with respect for 
23
human rights and fundamental freedoms beginning 
24
in 2010, and the establishment of a quasi-civilian 
25

•HR 5497 IH
government following credible elections in 2015, 
1
Burma’s military and civilian leaders have, since 
2
2016, overseen an increase in restrictions to freedom 
3
of expression (including for members of the press), 
4
freedom of peaceful assembly, freedom of associa-
5
tion, and freedom of religion or belief. In 2017, Bur-
6
mese 
authorities 
oversaw 
a 
genocide 
against 
7
Rohingya, which caused almost 1,000,000 Rohingya 
8
to seek refuge in neighboring Bangladesh. 
9
(4) On February 1, 2021, the Burmese military 
10
conducted a coup d’e´tat, declaring a year-long state 
11
of emergency and detaining State Counsellor Aung 
12
San Suu Kyi, President Win Myint, and dozens of 
13
other government officials and elected members of 
14
parliament, thus derailing Burma’s transition to de-
15
mocracy and disregarding the will of the people of 
16
Burma as expressed in the November 2020 elections, 
17
which were determined to be credible by inter-
18
national and national observers. 
19
(5) Following the coup, some ousted members 
20
of parliament established the Committee Rep-
21
resenting the Pyidaungsu Hluttaw, which subse-
22
quently released the Federal Democracy Charter in 
23
March 2021 and established the National Unity 
24
Government in April 2021. In June 2021, the Na-
25

•HR 5497 IH
tional Unity Government included ethnic minorities 
1
and women among its cabinet and released a policy 
2
paper outlining pledges to Rohingya and calling for 
3
‘‘justice and reparations’’ for the community. 
4
(6) Since the coup on February 1, 2021, the 
5
Burmese military has— 
6
(A) used lethal force on peaceful protestors 
7
on multiple occasions, killing more than 1,100 
8
people, including more than 50 children; 
9
(B) detained more than 4,000 peaceful 
10
protestors, participants in the Civil Disobe-
11
dience Movement, labor leaders, government of-
12
ficials and elected members of parliament, 
13
members of the media, and others, according to 
14
the Assistance Association for Political Pris-
15
oners; 
16
(C) issued laws and directives that could 
17
be used to further impede fundamental free-
18
doms, including freedom of expression (includ-
19
ing for members of the press), freedom of 
20
peaceful assembly, and freedom of association; 
21
and 
22
(D) imposed restrictions on the internet 
23
and telecommunications. 
24
05:21 Oct 07, 2021

•HR 5497 IH
(7) More than 230,000 people have been inter-
1
nally displaced since the coup, while thousands of 
2
others have sought refuge in neighboring countries, 
3
and the Burmese military continues to block human-
4
itarian assistance to populations in need. According 
5
to the World Health Organization, the military has 
6
carried out more than 250 attacks on health care 
7
entities since the coup and killed at least 18 health 
8
workers. Dozens more have been arbitrarily detained 
9
and hundreds have warrants out for their arrest. 
10
The military has continued such attacks even as 
11
they inhibit efforts to combat a devastating third 
12
wave of COVID–19. The brutality of the Burmese 
13
military was on full display on March 27, 2021, 
14
Armed Forces Day, when, after threatening on state 
15
television to shoot protesters in the head, security 
16
forces killed more than 150 people. 
17
(8) The coup represents a continuation of a 
18
long pattern of violent and anti-democratic behavior 
19
by the military that stretches back decades, with the 
20
military having previously taken over Burma in 
21
coups d’e´tat in 1962 and 1988, and having ignored 
22
the results of the 1990 elections, and a long history 
23
of violently repressing protest movements, including 
24
killing and imprisoning thousands of peaceful 
25
05:21 Oct 07, 2021
H5497
8 
•HR 5497 IH
protestors during pro-democracy demonstrations in 
1
1988 and 2007. 
2
(9) The military also has a long history of vio-
3
lent repression of ethnic and religious minorities. On 
4
August 25, 2017, Burmese military and security 
5
forces launched a genocidal military campaign 
6
against Rohingya, resulting in a mass exodus of 
7
some 750,000 Rohingya from Burma’s Rakhine 
8
State into Bangladesh, where they remain. The Gov-
9
ernment of Burma has since taken no steps to im-
10
prove conditions for Rohingya still in Rakhine State, 
11
who remain at high risk of genocide and other atroc-
12
ities, or to create conditions conducive to the return 
13
of Rohingya refugees. 
14
(10) The Burmese military has also engaged in 
15
renewed violence with other ethnic minority groups 
16
across the country. Since 2018, fighting between the 
17
Burmese military and the Arakan Army has dis-
18
placed more than 220,000 people in Rakhine and 
19
Chin States, including more than 130,000 Rohingya 
20
confined to camps since 2012. The military has con-
21
tinued to commit atrocities in Kachin and Shan 
22
States that a 2019 report by Amnesty International 
23
described as ‘‘relentless and ruthless’’. Fighting in 
24
northern Burma has forced more than 100,000 peo-
25
05:21 Oct 07, 2021
H5497

•HR 5497 IH
ple from their homes and into camps for internally 
1
displaced persons. The Government of Burma con-
2
tinues to heavily proscribe humanitarian and media 
3
access to conflict-affected populations across the 
4
country. 
5
(11) With more than $500,000,000 in humani-
6
tarian assistance provided to Burma and Ban-
7
gladesh in 2020 alone, the United States is the larg-
8
est humanitarian donor to populations in need as a 
9
result of conflicts in Burma. In May 2021, the 
10
United States announced nearly $155,000,000 in 
11
additional humanitarian assistance to meet the ur-
12
gent needs of Rohingya refugees and host commu-
13
nities in Bangladesh and people affected by ongoing 
14
violence in Burma’s Rakhine, Kachin, Shan, and 
15
Chin states. In August 2021, the United States pro-
16
vided $50,000,000 in critical humanitarian assist-
17
ance to the people of Burma. 
18
(12) Both government- and military-initiated 
19
investigations into human rights abuses in Burma 
20
involving violence between ethnic minorities and 
21
Burmese security forces have failed to yield credible 
22
results or hold perpetrators accountable. 
23
(13) In its report dated September 17, 2018, 
24
the United Nations Independent International Fact- 
25
05:21 Oct 07, 2021
H5497
10 
•HR 5497 IH
Finding Mission on Myanmar concluded, on reason-
1
able grounds, that the factors allowing inference of 
2
‘‘genocidal intent’’ are present with respect to the 
3
attacks against Rohingya in Rakhine State, and acts 
4
by Burmese security forces against Rohingya in 
5
Rakhine State and other ethnic minorities in Kachin 
6
and Shan States amount to ‘‘crimes against human-
7
ity’’ and ‘‘war crimes’’. The Independent Inter-
8
national Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar estab-
9
lished by the United Nations Human Rights Council 
10
recommended that the United Nations Security 
11
Council ‘‘should ensure accountability for crimes 
12
under international law committed in Myanmar, 
13
preferably by referring the situation to the Inter-
14
national Criminal Court or alternatively by creating 
15
an ad hoc international criminal tribunal’’. The Mis-
16
sion also recommended the imposition of targeted 
17
economic sanctions, including an arms embargo on 
18
Burma. 
19
(14) In a subsequent report dated August 5, 
20
2019, the United Nations Independent International 
21
Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar found that the 
22
Burmese military’s economic interests ‘‘enable its 
23
conduct’’ and that it benefits from and supports ex-
24
tractive industry businesses operating in conflict-af-

fected areas in northern Burma, including natural 
1
resources, particularly oil and gas, minerals and 
2
gems and argued that ‘‘through controlling its own 
3
business empire, the Tatmadaw can evade the ac-
4
countability and oversight that normally arise from 
5
civilian oversight of military budgets’’. The report 
6
called for the United Nations and individual govern-
7
ments to place targeted sanctions on all senior offi-
8
cials in the Burmese military as well as their eco-
9
nomic interests, especially Myanma Economic Hold-
10
ings Limited and Myanmar Economic Corporation. 
11
(15) On February 11, 2021, President Biden 
12
issued Executive Order 14014 in response to the 
13
coup d’e´tat, authorizing sanctions against the Bur-
14
mese military, its economic interests, and other per-
15
petrators of the coup. 
16
(16) Since the issuance of Executive Order 
17
14014, the Department of the Treasury has imposed 
18
sanctions with respect to— 
19
(A) multiple high-ranking individuals and 
20
their family members, including the Com-
21
mander-in-Chief of the Burmese military, Min 
22
Aung Hlaing;

2
(C) other corporate entities and Burmese 
3
military entities, including the military regime’s 
4
State Administrative Council. 
5
(17) Pursuant to Executive Order 14014, the 
6
United States has also implemented new restrictions 
7
on exports and reexports to Burma. 
8
(18) On March 22, 2021, the United States 
9
designated Burma’s Chief of Police, Than Hlaing, 
10
and the Bureau of Special Operations commander, 
11
Lieutenant General Aung Soe, for the imposition of 
12
sanctions pursuant to Executive Order 14014. The 
13
United States further designated 2 army units, the 
14
33rd and 77th Light Infantry Divisions, for the im-
15
position of sanctions pursuant to Executive Order 
16
14014, for being responsible for or complicit in, or 
17
having directly or indirectly engaged or attempted to 
18
engage in, actions or policies that prohibit, limit, or 
19
penalize the exercise of freedom of expression or as-
20
sembly by people in Burma. 
21
(19) On March 25, 2021, the United States 
22
designated 2 entities linked to the coup leaders, 
23
Myanma Economic Holdings Public Company Lim-
24
ited and Myanmar Economic Corporation Limited.

4
ganizations led by former members of such regi-
5

(20) On April 8, 2021, the United States des-
7
ignated Myanma Gems Enterprise, a Burmese state- 
8
owned entity that is responsible for all gemstone ac-
9
tivities in Burma, for the imposition of sanctions 
10
pursuant to Executive Order 14014. Gemstones are 
11
a key economic resource for the Burmese military 
12
regime. 
13
(21) On May 17, 2021, the United States des-
