Supporting the goals and ideals of the International Day 
for the Elimination of Violence against Women. 
Whereas November 25, 2022, is recognized as the Inter-
national Day for the Elimination of Violence against 
Women; 
Whereas one out of every three women worldwide will be 
physically, sexually, or otherwise abused during her life-
time with rates reaching 70 percent in some countries;

•HRES 957 IH 
Whereas the right of women to be free from violence is inte-
gral to article 2 of the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights; 
Whereas violence against women is a public health epidemic 
and a barrier to solving global challenges such as extreme 
poverty, HIV/AIDS, and conflict; 
Whereas violence against women devastates the lives of mil-
lions of women and girls, in peacetime and in conflict, 
and knows no national or cultural barriers; 
Whereas physical abuse and rape are used as weapons of war 
during times of conflict to achieve military objectives 
such as genocide, ethnic cleansing, spreading political ter-
ror, breaking the resistance of a community, intimidation, 
or to extract information; 
Whereas in Rwanda, up to half a million women were raped 
during the 1994 genocide; 
Whereas in Bosnia and Herzegovina, close to 60,000 women 
were raped during the war in which violence against 
women was used as a tool of ethnic cleansing; 
Whereas the trafficking of women has become a global phe-
nomenon where victims are sexually exploited, forced into 
labor, and subjected to abuse; 
Whereas, according to the Violence Policy Center in 2018, in 
the United States there were 1,946 females murdered by 
males in single victim/single offender incidents that were 
submitted to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for its 
Supplementary Homicide Report, an average of five 
women every day; 
Whereas of all the women murdered in the United States, 
about 63 percent were killed by an intimate partner;

Whereas, according to the National Center for Injury Preven-
tion and Control, women in the United States experience 
about 4,800,000 intimate partner-related physical as-
saults and rapes every year; 
Whereas less than 20 percent of battered women sought med-
ical treatment following an injury; 
Whereas, according to the National Crime Victimization Sur-
vey, which includes crimes that were not reported to the 
police, 406,970 women in the United States were raped 
or sexually assaulted in 2019, more than 1000 women 
every day; 
Whereas other estimates, such as those generated by the 
FBI, are much lower because they rely on data from law 
enforcement agencies; 
Whereas a significant number of crimes are never even re-
ported for reasons that include the victim’s feeling that 
nothing can or will be done and the personal nature of 
the incident; 
Whereas young women, low-income women, and some minori-
ties are disproportionately victims of domestic violence 
and rape; 
Whereas women ages 20 to 24 are at the greatest risk of 
nonfatal domestic violence, and women age 24 and under 
suffer from the highest rates of rape; 
Whereas income is also a factor: the poorer the household, 
the higher the rate of domestic violence, with women in 
the lowest income category experiencing more than six 
times the rate of nonfatal intimate partner violence as 
compared to women in the highest income category; 
Whereas Black women face higher rates of domestic violence 
than White women, and American Indian women are vic-

timized at a rate more than double that of women of 
other races; 
Whereas the Latino Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual 
Violence of Indiana advocates for Latino and immigrant 
communities in the United States who suffer from isola-
tion and limited resources in situations of domestic and 
sexual violence due to the lack of cultural competency 
and bilingual and bicultural services; 
Whereas national statistics show that approximately one in 
four (23.4 percent) Latinas report that they have been 
abused at some point in their lifetime; 
Whereas the National Human Rights Commission has re-
ported violations in detention centers, including poor con-
ditions, abuse and corruption, overpopulation, and inad-
equate services; 
Whereas migrant women are particularly vulnerable to har-
assment and abuse in detention; 
Whereas the Indiana Coalition Against Domestic Violence 
found that domestic violence-related deaths in 2020 were 
up by roughly 85 percent in Indiana compared to the 
same time last year; 
Whereas, according to the Family Violence Prevention Fund, 
‘‘growing up in a violent home may be a terrifying and 
traumatic experience that can affect every aspect of a 
child’s life, growth and development. . . . children who 
have been exposed to family violence suffer symptoms of 
post-traumatic stress disorder, such as bed-wetting or 
nightmares, and were at greater risk than their peers of 
having allergies, asthma, gastrointestinal problems, head-
aches and flu.’’;

•HRES 957 IH 
Whereas in addition, women who experience physical abuse as 
children are at a greater risk of victimization as adults; 
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention esti-
mates that the cost of domestic violence in 2010 was 
more than $8,300,000,000; 
Whereas this cost includes medical care, mental health serv-
ices, and lost productivity; 
Whereas, according to the National Coalition of Anti-Violence 
Programs, ‘‘domestic violence affecting LGBT individuals 
continues to be grossly underreported . . . there is a lack 
of awareness and denial about the existence of this type 
of violence and its impact, both by LGBT people and 
non-LGBT people alike’’; 
Whereas myths regarding gender roles perpetuate the silence 
surrounding these abusive relationships, for example, the 
belief that there are not abusive lesbian relationships be-
cause women do not abuse each other; 
Whereas shelters are often unequipped to handle the needs of 
lesbians (as a women-only shelter is not much defense 
against a female abuser), and transgendered individuals; 
Whereas statistics regarding domestic violence against les-
bian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people are 
unavailable at the national level, but as regional studies 
demonstrate, domestic violence is as much as a problem 
within LGBT communities as it is among heterosexual 
ones; and 
Whereas the people of the United States should be encour-
aged to participate in the International Day for the 
Elimination of Violence against Women: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
