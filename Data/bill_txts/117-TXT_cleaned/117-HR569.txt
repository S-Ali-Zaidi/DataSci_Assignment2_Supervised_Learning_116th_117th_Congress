Fund, funding for schools and hospitals in Lebanon 
through the American Schools and Hospitals Abroad Pro-
gram, and funding through the Middle East Partnership 
Initiative; 
Whereas the integrity and independence of the LAF serves 
a United States national security interest; 
Whereas the LAF has a longstanding partnership with the 
United States military; 
Whereas the LAF, as the primary institution entrusted with 
Lebanon’s defense, security, and sovereignty, is an impor-
tant force to support the safety and security of Lebanon; 
Whereas the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon 
(UNIFIL) must fully implement its mandate in order to 
counteract destabilizing forces in Lebanon and help lower 
tensions at the Lebanon-Israel border; 
Whereas, on August 28, 2020, the United Nations Security 
Council unanimously extended and expanded UNIFIL’s 
mandate and called on the Lebanese Government to fa-
cilitate prompt and full access to sites requested by 
United Nations peacekeepers for investigation, urged 
freedom of movement and unimpeded access for peace-
keepers to all parts of the Blue Line between Lebanon 
and Israel, and condemned in the strongest terms all at-
tempts to restrict United Nations troop movements and 
attacks on mission personnel; 
Whereas United States support for United States institutions 
in Lebanon, such as the Lebanese American University 
and the American University of Beirut, through humani-
tarian and bilateral economic assistance helps foster 
democratic ideals and principles throughout Lebanon;

Whereas Lebanon hosts an estimated 1,500,000 refugees, the 
highest refugee-per-capita ratio in the world, despite chal-
lenges within its own social and economic sectors; 
Whereas Hezbollah’s multipronged circumvention of legiti-
mate government functions has contributed to endemic 
corruption and rampant mismanagement by parties in 
Lebanon; 
Whereas the mismanagement and corruption has driven Leb-
anon to the brink of economic collapse, with one of the 
highest rates of public debt, food insecurity, and hyper-
inflation in the world; 
Whereas Iran undermines Lebanon’s sovereignty and its his-
tory as a United States partner and democratic actor in 
the Middle East; 
Whereas Iran’s terrorist proxy Hezbollah violates United Na-
tions Security Council Resolution 1701 (2006), stokes 
sectarian violence, destabilizes the Lebanese economy, 
and supports corruption and violence within Lebanon and 
seeks to destroy the pursuit of peace throughout the re-
gion; 
Whereas, on August 4, 2020, 2,750 tons of ammonium ni-
trate detonated at the Port of Beirut, killing approxi-
mately 200 people and injuring thousands more; 
Whereas the dangerous and highly explosive material had 
been unsafely stored at the Port of Beirut since 2014, 
despite repeated warnings over the threat the stockpile 
posed to the surrounding civilian population; 
Whereas the explosions destroyed vast swaths of infrastruc-
ture across Beirut and displaced up to 300,000 people; 
Whereas the explosions destroyed or damaged the entire Port 
of Beirut, through which Lebanon imports the bulk of its

food, including the destruction of approximately 120,000 
metric tons of desperately needed food stocks, according 
to the United Nations; 
Whereas the United States Government has longstanding 
concerns about Hezbollah’s use of and influence over the 
Beirut Port as a transit and storage point for its ter-
rorist enterprise; 
Whereas the people of Lebanon across the political spectrum 
have renewed demands for a meaningful change in Leb-
anon’s political leadership, government accountability, 
and transparency; 
Whereas the need for humanitarian aid and food assistance 
continues and there is a rise in public protests to support 
the ongoing needs of the people of Lebanon; 
Whereas the country of Lebanon is on the brink of economic 
collapse and remains in a months-long government for-
mation stalemate; and 
Whereas a secure Lebanon with a credible, transparent, gov-
ernment accountable to the Lebanese people and free 
from Iranian and Hezbollah interference and based on 
the rule of law and democratic principles is in the inter-
ests of the Lebanese people, the United States, and 
United States partners and allies: Now, therefore, be it
