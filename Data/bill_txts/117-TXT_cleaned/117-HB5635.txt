an environment capable of marshaling capital, devel-
1
oping new technologies, and producing new innova-
2
tions; 
3
(2) the changing nature of the world economy, 
4
with ever more globalization and increasing returns 
5
to scale on new technologies, has made it more im-
6
portant than ever to stay on the cutting edge of the 
7
technological frontier; 
8
(3) the People’s Republic of China continues to 
9
be a leading violator of intellectual property rights in 
10
the world as documented by the United States Trade 
11
Representative’s 2021 Special 301 Report, and esti-
12
mates place the cost of intellectual property theft by 
13
China of between $200 and $600 billion per year; 
14
(4) the growing scope of research dollars per in-
15
novative discovery make the harms and costs of in-
16
tellectual property theft more acute now than any 
17
time in history; 
18
(5) the importance of protecting the intellectual 
19
property of United States technology and tele-
20
communications firms is of paramount importance 
21
to the dynamism and resilience of the United States 
22
economy and the preservation of United States na-
23
tional security; and

is crucial that the United States Government, in co-

ordination with the private sector, act to curtail 
4
thieves of American ingenuity.
