(1) Vieques is an island municipality of Puerto 
1
Rico, measuring approximately 21 miles long by 4 
2
miles wide, and located approximately 8 miles east 
3
of the main island of Puerto Rico. 
4
(2) Prior to Hurricane Maria, residents of 
5
Vieques were served by an urgent medical care facil-
6
ity, the Susana Centeno Family Health Center, and 
7
residents had to travel off-island to obtain medical 
8
services, including most types of emergency care be-
9
cause the facility did not have the basic use of x-ray 
10
machines, 
CT 
machines, 
EKG 
machines, 
11
ultrasounds, or PET scans. 
12
(3) The predominant means of transporting 
13
passengers and goods between Vieques and the main 
14
island of Puerto Rico is by ferry boat service, and 
15
over the years, the efficiency of this service has fre-
16
quently been disrupted, unreliable, and difficult for 
17
cancer patients to endure to receive treatment. Each 
18
trip to Ceiba, Puerto Rico, for the cancer patient is 
19
an additional out-of-pocket expense ranging from 
20
$120 to $200. 
21
(4) The United States Military maintained a 
22
presence on the eastern and western portions of 
23
Vieques for close to 60 years, and used parts of the 
24
island as a training range during those years, drop-

ping over 80 million tons of ordnance and other 
1
weaponry available to the United States military 
2
since World War II. 
3
(5) The unintended, unknown, and unavoidable 
4
consequences of these exercises were to expose 
5
Americans living on the islands to the residue of 
6
that weaponry which includes heavy metals and 
7
many other chemicals now known to harm human 
8
health. 
9
(6) According to Government and independent 
10
documentation, the island of Vieques has high levels 
11
of heavy metals and has been exposed to chemical 
12
weapons and toxic chemicals. Since the military ac-
13
tivity in Vieques, island residents have suffered from 
14
the health impacts from long-term exposure to envi-
15
ronmental contamination as a result of 62 years of 
16
military operations, and have experienced higher 
17
rates of certain diseases among residents, including 
18
cancer, cirrhosis, hypertension, diabetes, heavy metal 
19
diseases, 
along 
with 
many 
unnamed 
and 
20
uncategorized illnesses. These toxic residues have 
21
caused the American residents of Vieques to develop 
22
illnesses due to ongoing exposure. 
23
(7) In 2017, Vieques was hit by Hurricane 
24
Maria, an unusually destructive storm that dev-
25

•HR 1126 IH
astated Puerto Rico and intensified the existing hu-
1
manitarian crisis on the island by destroying existing 
2
medical facilities. 
3
(8) The medical systems in place prior to Hur-
4
ricane Maria were unable to properly handle the 
5
health crisis that existed due to the toxic residue left 
6
on the island by the military’s activities. 
7
(9) After Maria, the medical facility was closed 
8
due to damage and continues to be unable to per-
9
form even the few basic services that it did provide. 
10
Vieques needs a medical facility that can treat and 
11
address the critical and urgent need to get life-sav-
12
ing medical services to its residents. Due to legal re-
13
strictions, the Federal Emergency Management 
14
Agency (in this Act referred to as ‘‘FEMA’’) is un-
15
able to provide a hospital where its capabilities ex-
16
ceed the abilities of the facility that existed prior to 
17
Maria; therefore Vieques needs assistance to build a 
18
facility to manage the vast health needs of its resi-
19
dents. 
20
(10) Every American has benefitted from the 
21
sacrifices of those Americans who have lived and are 
22
living on Vieques and it is our intent to acknowledge 
23
that sacrifice and to treat those Americans with the 
24

same respect and appreciation that other Americans 
1
enjoy. 
2
(11) In 2012, the residents of Vieques were de-
3
nied the ability to address their needs in Court due 
4
to sovereign immunity, Sa´nchez v. United States, 
5
No. 3:09–cv–01260–DRD (D.P.R.). However, the 
6
United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit 
7
referred the issue to Congress and urged it to ad-
8
dress the humanitarian crisis. This bill attempts to 
9
satisfy that request such that Americans living on 
10
Vieques have a remedy for the suffering they have 
11
endured.
