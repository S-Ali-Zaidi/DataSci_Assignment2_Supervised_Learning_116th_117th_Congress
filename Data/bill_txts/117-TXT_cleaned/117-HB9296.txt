nearly 35,000 employees. Understaffing across the 
1
agency jeopardizes the health, safety, and well-being 
2
of staff and inmates alike. 
3
(2) Understaffing at Bureau of Prison institu-
4
tions poses a threat to inmates, who will con-
5
sequently lack access to lifesaving medical care, effi-
6
cient review of their casework, sanitary living condi-
7
tions, access to vital recidivism reduction program-
8
ming, and protections against abuse or sexual mis-
9
conduct. 
10
(3) Understaffing at Bureau of Prison institu-
11
tions will also result in reduced staff safety, esca-
12
lated workplace abuse, stressful work conditions, en-
13
hanced mental and physical health concerns, and un-
14
acceptably long work shifts for employees. 
15
(4) Mandated overtime, misuse of augmentation 
16
or reassignment, and overworked employees will re-
17
duce prison security and threaten public safety.
