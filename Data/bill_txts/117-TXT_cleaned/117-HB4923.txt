(1) Since the founding of the United States, the 
1
institutions of the United States of America have set 
2
the worldwide standard for promoting democracy, 
3
freedom, liberty, and virtue.

(2) Increasingly, students across the country 
5
are being taught misinformation, including that the 
6
principles of the founding of the United States were 
7
lies from the start, that the core institutions of the 
8
United States are fundamentally racist and designed 
9
to propagate racism, and that it is acceptable to im-
10
pute guilt to present-day individuals based on the 
11
color of their skin, rather than the content of their 
12
character. 
13
(3) The best antidote to misinformation is the 
14
truth, which is reflected in the documents relating to 
15
the founding of the United States and other arti-
16
facts of the United States, including the Declaration 
17
of Independence, the Constitution of the United 
18
States, and the Pledge of Allegiance.
