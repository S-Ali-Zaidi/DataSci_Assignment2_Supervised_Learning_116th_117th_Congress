A BILL 
To establish a commission to address the fundamental reper-
cussions of a misguided intervention, by the United 
States on the Dominican Republic between 1916–1924 
and 1965–1966, including to study and consider an apol-
ogy and proposals for the repair of relations and rec-
onciliation with the people of the Dominican Republic, 
and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Commission on United 
2
States Occupations Act’’ or the ‘‘La Comisio´n de las 
3
ocupaciones norteamericanas Act’’. 
4
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
5
Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) The United States established diplomatic 
7
relations with the Dominican Republic in 1884 fol-
8
lowing its independence. Ever since, the country has 
9
witnessed periods of dictatorship, austerity, interven-
10
tions, and political insurrection, along with an in-
11
creasing national debt that led to two occupations by 
12
the United States in the Dominican Republic. 
13
(2) After the Civil War, much of America’s at-
14
tention turned to rebuilding itself during the Recon-
15
struction Era. For various years, the United States 
16
Navy had wanted a naval base in the Caribbean to 
17
conduct its naval operations. The Dominican Repub-
18
lic had a suitable bay (the Samana´ Bay). In 1869, 
19
President Ulysses S. Grant attempted the annex-
20
ation of Santo Domingo with the promise of even-
21
tual statehood. The annexation treaty failed to reach 
22
the two-thirds vote needed (the vote was a tie) in the 
23
Senate, falling one vote short and thus preventing 
24
the Dominican Republic from becoming a United 
25
States Territory.

(3) By 1916, the national debt had swollen to 
1
well over $30 million, and the United States Govern-
2
ment stepped in to control the various custom 
3
houses in the major ports. 
4
(4) On May 13, 1916, a contingent of the 
5
United States Marine Corps landed and within two 
6
months took control of the nation, imposing a mili-
7
tary government under the command of Rear Admi-
8
ral Harry Shepard Knapp, which resulted in eight 
9
years of strong United States military presence and 
10
of great resentment from Dominican nationals who 
11
lost their sovereignty at the hands of United States 
12
forces. 
13
(5) Upon withdrawal in 1924, by orders of 
14
President Warren Harding, the United States came 
15
to an agreement with the Dominican Republic which 
16
guaranteed customs duties to continue paying off its 
17
national long-standing debts. In the same year, when 
18
United States forces withdrew, 144 marines were 
19
dead and 50 were injured. The Dominicans suffered 
20
950 casualties between dead and injured. 
21
(6) The occupation sequel had its effect in the 
22
years to come, through the rise in power of Rafael 
23
Leonidas Trujillo. Trujillo, a member of the Na-
24
tional Guard created in the early 1919 by the 
25

•HR 2725 IH
United States, and despite being a person of ques-
1
tionable moral character, received support from the 
2
United States Government. During his 31 years of 
3
dictatorship, Trujillo ruled the Dominican Republic 
4
with an iron fist and diverted funds for his army 
5
and to suppress internal dissent. 
6
(7) The second intervention and occupation of 
7
the Dominican Republic by the United States Armed 
8
Forces, called ‘‘Operation Power Pack’’, took place 
9
between 1965–1966, after a period of political insta-
10
bility and military coup following the assassination 
11
of dictator Rafael Leonidas Trujillo in 1961. 
12
(8) In 1962, Juan Bosch became the first elect-
13
ed president of the Dominican Republic, after 31 
14
years of tyranny. Bosch tried to establish a demo-
15
cratic, secular constitution, but on September 25, 
16
1963, a military coup overthrew Bosch and replaced 
17
him with a junta led by Donald Reid Cabral. 
18
(9) President Lyndon Johnson sent a total of 
19
42,000 American troops, supplemented by an Inter- 
20
American Peace Force (2,000 troops) to the island 
21
to support ‘‘La Junta’’ led by Donald Reid Cabral. 
22
Shortly after the 1965 Civil War or ‘‘La Revolucio´n 
23
del 65’’, questionable elections were held, and these 
24
20:54 Jun 09, 2021

5 
•HR 2725 IH
resulted in the election of Joaquin Balaguer to the 
1
Presidency of the Dominican Republic. 
2
(10) Balaguer, a previous member of the Tru-
3
jillo-led government, ruled the Dominican Republic 
4
for the following 12 years. This period was charac-
5
terized by turmoil, alleged disappearances, and 
6
deaths of hundreds of young political men and social 
7
activists. 
8
(11) The injustice that flourished in the Domin-
9
ican Republic during this era constituted an immoral 
10
and tyrannic regime, depriving its citizens from a 
11
free and sovereign government for 12 more years. 
12
(12) Upon withdrawal in 1966 when United 
13
States forces withdrew, the United States suffered 
14
239 casualties, with 27 killed in action, 189 wound-
15
ed in action, and 21 noncombat deaths. The Domini-
16
can Republic suffered over 7,000 (civilians and 
17
Armed Forces) casualties, with 4,275 killed in action 
18
and 3,000 wounded 
19
(13) Approximately 5,225 Dominicans and 192 
20
Americans lost their lives during the United States 
21
occupations of the Dominican Republic. During 
22
these occupations and interventions 239 Americans 
23
and over 3,000 Dominicans were injured.
