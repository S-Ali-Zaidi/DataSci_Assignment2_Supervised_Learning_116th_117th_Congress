To amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to 
establish a tobacco product standard prohibiting any e-

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Ending Nicotine De-
4
pendence from Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems Act 
5
of 2021’’ or the ‘‘END ENDS Act of 2021’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
7
Congress finds as follows:

•HR 3051 IH
(1) According to the Centers for Disease Con-
1
trol and Prevention (in this section referred to as 
2
the ‘‘CDC’’), the brain keeps developing until ap-
3
proximately age 25, and nicotine exposure can harm 
4
the parts of the brain that control attention, learn-
5
ing, mood, and impulse control. 
6
(2) Adolescent nicotine use may also increase 
7
the risk of future addiction to other drugs. 
8
(3) A recent CDC study found that 99 percent 
9
of e-cigarettes sold in the United States contain nic-
10
otine. 
11
(4) In congressional testimony before the Sub-
12
committee on Economic and Consumer Policy of the 
13
Committee on Oversight and Reform of the House 
14
of Representatives on September 24, 2019, CDC 
15
Principal Deputy Director Anne Schuchat stated 
16
that ‘‘fourth generation e-cigarette devices’’ were 
17
first sold in 2015 and ‘‘use nicotine salts, which can 
18
lead to much more available nicotine’’. 
19
(5) According to Dr. Schuchat’s testimony, 
20
fourth generation devices ‘‘can cross the blood-brain 
21
barrier and lead to potentially more effects on the 
22
developing brain in adolescents’’. Further, ‘‘the very 
23
high levels of accessible nicotine and the discreet use 
24
of the product’’ directly link the growing popularity 
25

•HR 3051 IH
of fourth generation e-cigarette devices to the rise in 
1
youth e-cigarette use. 
2
(6) Prior to the use of nicotine salts, which are 
3
now used in the e-liquids of the most popular e-ciga-
4
rettes, most e-cigarettes contained ‘‘freebase nico-
5
tine’’. Because freebase nicotine has a much harsher 
6
effect on the inhaler, these e-cigarette devices con-
7
tained much less nicotine than devices which contain 
8
nicotine salts. 
9
(7) The most popular e-cigarette manufactured 
10
and sold in the United States, which is considered 
11
a ‘‘fourth generation device’’, most frequently con-
12
tains an ‘‘e-liquid’’ with 59 milligrams per milliliter 
13
of nicotine. 
14
(8) In response, the European Union, the 
15
United Kingdom, and Israel implemented regula-
16
tions to cap the concentration of nicotine in e-ciga-
17
rette e-liquids to 20 milligrams per milliliter. 
18
(9) The United Kingdom’s nicotine cap went 
19
into effect on May 20, 2017. As youth use sky-
20
rocketed in the United States between 2017 and 
21
2018, the percentage of youth e-cigarette users who 
22
use more than once a week only rose from 1.2 per-
23
cent to 1.7 percent, and the percentage of youth who 
24
00:59 Jun 10, 2021
H3051

•HR 3051 IH
use less than weekly decreased from 2.2 percent to 
1
1.8 percent. 
2
(10) E-cigarettes manufactured and sold in the 
3
United States are currently not subject to any nico-
4
tine cap, and e-cigarette manufacturers are per-
5
mitted to design their products to be as addictive as 
6
possible. 
7
(11) According to the 2020 National Youth To-
8
bacco Survey, approximately 3,600,000 youths use e- 
9
cigarettes, including 19.6 percent of high school stu-
10
dents and 4.7 percent of middle school students. 
11
(12) Among high school students who smoke e- 
12
cigarettes, nearly 40 percent report using them 20 
13
or more days per month, and nearly one-quarter re-
14
port using them daily. 
15
(13) The CDC, the Food and Drug Administra-
16
tion, the Department of Health and Human Serv-
17
ices, the Surgeon General of the Public Health Serv-
18
ice, and various State and local health authorities 
19
have determined the skyrocketing e-cigarette use 
20
amongst American youth to be an ‘‘epidemic’’.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
22
It is the sense of the Congress that— 
23
00:59 Jun 10, 2021
H3051
5 
•HR 3051 IH
(1) effectively combating the youth e-cigarette 
1
epidemic will require the implementation of bold and 
2
enduring policy solutions; 
3
(2) under the current regulatory framework, 
4
American youth have easy access to highly addictive 
5
‘‘fourth generation’’ e-cigarette devices that hook 
6
them into a lifelong addiction to nicotine; 
7
(3) in order to significantly decrease youth e- 
8
cigarette use and to reduce the dangers associated 
9
with excessive nicotine inhalation, the Federal Gov-
10
ernment should regulate nicotine levels in e-ciga-
11
rettes in order to make them less addictive and less 
12
harmful to youth; and 
13
(4) in addition to regulating nicotine levels, the 
14
Federal Government should also review other factors 
15
related to the composition and function of fourth 
16
generation e-cigarettes in order to make them less 
17
addictive and appealing to youth, including battery 
18
power and design.
