SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Hours after the attacks on Pearl Harbor, 
3
Hawaii, Imperial Japanese forces launched an at-
4
tack on the Philippines, cutting off vital lines of 
5
communication to members of the Armed Forces of 
6
the United States (referred to in this Act as the 
7
‘‘Armed Forces’’) and Filipino troops in the Far 
8
East under the command of General Douglas Mac-
9
Arthur. 
10
(2) On December 8, 1941, the 200th and 515th 
11
Coast Artillery Regiments, successors to the New 
12
Mexico National Guardsmen who made up part of 
13
the famed ‘‘Rough Riders’’ of the Spanish-American 
14
War, were the ‘‘first to fire’’. 
15
(3) Despite being cut off from supply lines and 
16
reinforcements, members of the Armed Forces and 
17
Philippine troops quickly executed a plan to delay 
18
the Japanese invasion and defend the Philippines 
19
against that invasion. 
20
(4) Combined Armed Forces and Filipino 
21
ground forces fought a prolonged 6-month resistance 
22
to Imperial Japan’s invasion of the Philippines. 
23
With the Armed Forces unable to deliver reinforce-
24
ments, the Armed Forces and Filipino forces slowly 
25
deteriorated in combat effectiveness from—

(A) lack of food, supplies, and ammunition; 
1
(B) disease; and 
2
(C) no air and naval support. 
3
(5) By December 10, 1941, the United States 
4
Army Air Corps airfields at Del Carmen, Clark, 
5
Nichols, and Nielson on Luzon in the Philippines, as 
6
well as the nearby United States naval facilities at 
7
Cavite and Olongapo, had been destroyed. The sur-
8
viving sailors, marines, and airmen were organized 
9
into provisional infantry units and sent to fight on 
10
the Bataan Peninsula. 
11
(6) By April 1942, troops from the United 
12
States and the Philippines had bravely and staunch-
13
ly fought off enemy attacks in Bataan for more than 
14
4 months under strenuous conditions that resulted 
15
in widespread starvation and disease. 
16
(7) Securing the withdrawal of Armed Forces 
17
on Luzon to the Bataan Peninsula were the fol-
18
lowing: 
19
(A) 1,809 New Mexico National Guards-
20
men from 200th and 515th Coast Artillery 
21
(Antiaircraft) regiments. First stationed at 
22
Fort Stotsenberg north of Manila, they are 
23
credited as being the ‘‘first to fire’’ in the de-
24
fense of the Philippines on December 8, 1941.

(B) 1,006 National Guardsmen of the 
1
192nd GHQ Light Tank Battalion (596) com-

posed of Company A from Janesville, Wis-
3

Company C from Port Clinton, Ohio, and Com-

194th Light Tank Battalion (410) composed of 
7
Company A from Brainerd, Minnesota, Com-
8
pany B from Saint Joseph, Missouri, and Com-
9
pany C from Salinas, California. The 192nd 
10
and 194th Tank Battalions had arrived in the 
11
Philippines on or before Thanksgiving Day, 
12
1941. 
13
(8) Barely 1⁄2 of the men from the National 
14
Guard units described in paragraph (7) returned 
15
home at the end of the war, with the majority dying 
16
as prisoners of war of the Imperial Japanese Army. 
17
(9) By maintaining their position and engaging 
18
the enemy for as long as they did, the troops at Ba-
19
taan were able to change the momentum of the war, 
20
delaying the Japanese timetable to take control of 
21
the Southeast Pacific for needed war materials. Be-
22
cause of the heroic actions of the defenders of Ba-
23
taan, members of the Armed Forces and other Allied 
24
forces throughout the Pacific had time to regroup

and prepare for the successful liberation of the Pa-
1
cific and the Philippines. 
2
(10) On April 9, 1942, approximately 12,000 
3
members of the Armed Forces and 66,000 Filipino 
4
soldiers became prisoners of war with the surrender 
5
of the Armed Forces and Filipino forces on the Ba-
6
taan Peninsula in the Philippines by Major General 
7
Edward P. King. 
8
(11) Beginning on April 9, 1942, and lasting 
9
for almost 2 weeks, troops from the Armed Forces 
10
and the Philippines were taken prisoner and forced 
11
to march 65 miles without any food, water, or med-
12
ical care in what came to be known as the ‘‘Bataan 
13
Death March’’. They marched from Marviveles north 
14
to the San Fernando train station. At San Fer-
15
nando, 
the 
men 
were 
packed 
standing 
in 
16
unventilated boxcars for the 24-mile journey by rail 
17
to Capas. Survivors then marched an additional 3 
18
miles to the makeshift prisoner-of-war camp at 
19
Camp O’Donnell, an unfinished Philippine Army 
20
training facility. 
21
(12) During this forced march, an estimated 
22
700 members of the Armed Forces and possibly 
23
10,000 Filipino soldiers died from starvation, lack of 
24
medical care, sheer exhaustion, or abuse by their 
25

captors. Hundreds of men on the Death March re-
1
main unaccounted for from the march and its imme-
2
diate aftermath. 
3
(13) Conditions at the prisoner-of-war camps 
4
were appalling, leading to increased disease and mal-
5
nutrition, which precipitated extraordinary death 
6
rates of as high as 300 per day. 
7
(14) Thousands of troops fought under siege 
8
conditions on Corregidor (Fort Mills), a fortress is-
9
land in Manila Bay, the headquarters of the wartime 
10
U.S. Army Forces in the Far East, and the nearby 
11
fortified islands of Fort Hughes, Fort Drum, and 
12
Fort Frank until May 6, 1942. 
13
(15) On May 6, 1942, Corregidor, which had 
14
become the military command center for all the Phil-
15
ippines, United States Forces in the Philippines 
16
(USFIP), was surrendered by Lt. General Jonathan 
17
M. Wainwright. Nearly 10,000 members of the 
18
Armed Forces as well as more than 3,000 Filipino 
19
soldiers and nurses became prisoners of war of Im-
20
perial Japan. 
21
(16) On June 6, 1942, the prisoners at Camp 
22
O’Donnell were transferred to Camp Cabanatuan, 
23
north of Camp O’Donnell.

(17) Nearly 26,000 of the 50,000 Filipino pris-
1
oners of war died at Camp O’Donnell and survivors 
2
were gradually paroled from September through De-
3
cember 1942. 
4
(18) Between September of 1942 and December 
5
of 1944, prisoners of war from the Armed Forces 
6
who had survived the horrific Death March were 
7
shipped north for forced labor aboard ‘‘hell ships’’ 
8
and succumbed in great numbers because of the 
9
abysmal conditions. Many of those ships were mis-
10
takenly targeted by Allied naval forces because the 
11
Japanese military convoys were not properly labeled 
12
as carrying prisoners of war. The sinking of the 
13
Arisan Maru alone claimed nearly 1,800 lives of 
14
members of the Armed Forces. 
15
(19) The prisoners who remained in the camps 
16
suffered from continued mistreatment, malnutrition, 
17
lack of medical care, and horrific conditions until 
18
they were liberated in 1945. 
19
(20) The veterans of Bataan and Corregidor 
20
represented the best of the United States and the 
21
Philippines, hailed from various locales across both 
22
countries, and represented true diversity. 
23
(21) Over the subsequent decades, the veterans 
24
of Bataan and Corregidor formed support groups,

were honored in local and State memorials, and told 
1
their stories to all people of the United States. 
2
(22) The United States Navy has continued to 
3
honor the history and stories of the veterans of Ba-
4
taan by naming 2 ships after the battle, including 1 
5
ship that is still in service, the USS Bataan (LHD– 
6
5), in memory of their valor and honorable resist-
7
ance against Imperial Japanese forces. 
8
(23) Many of the survivors of Bataan and Cor-
9
regidor have died and those who remain continue to 
10
tell their stories. 
11
(24) The people of the United States and the 
12
Philippines are forever indebted to these men for— 
13
(A) the courage and tenacity they dem-
14
onstrated during the first 4 months of World 
15
War II fighting against enemy soldiers; and 
16
(B) the perseverance they demonstrated 
17
during 3 years of capture, imprisonment, and 
18
atrocious conditions, while maintaining dignity, 
19
honor, patriotism, and loyalty.
