RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the designation of November 9, 2021, 
as ‘‘National Microtia and Atresia Awareness Day’’.

ear, where the ear does not fully develop during the first 
trimester of pregnancy; 
Whereas microtia is often accompanied by aural atresia, 
which is the absence or closure of the external auditory 
ear canal resulting in hearing loss; 
Whereas it is estimated that there are 750,000 people world-
wide with microtia;

Whereas microtia is diagnosed at birth, affecting one ear or 
both ears, but there is no understanding as to why 
microtia occurs; 
Whereas aural atresia is usually diagnosed at birth, affecting 
one ear or both ears, but in some cases may not be recog-
nized until later in life; 
Whereas doctors and nurses may be informed of microtia and 
aural atresia, in certain settings, the conditions are rare 
enough that misinformation or lack of information on op-
tions and services, quickly evaporates any remaining 
sense of celebration that accompanies a birth; and 
Whereas living with facial challenges such as craniofacial 
microsomia and hearing loss, as well as the longing for 
social acceptance, are some of the daily concerns for indi-
viduals who are born with microtia or aural atresia: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) expresses support for the designation of 
2
‘‘National Microtia and Atresia Awareness Day’’; 
3
(2) encourages each person of the United 
4
States—

(A) to celebrate the community that is 
6
made up of not only children and adults with 
7
microtia or aural atresia, but families, teachers, 
8
advocates, and medical professionals from 
9
around the world who foster awareness and as-
10
sistance; and
