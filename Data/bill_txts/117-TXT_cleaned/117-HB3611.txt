A BILL 
To prohibit the discriminatory use of personal information 
by online platforms in any algorithmic process, to require 
transparency in the use of algorithmic processes and 
content moderation, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Algorithmic Justice

and Online Platform Transparency Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following: 
7
23:49 Jul 07, 2021

2 
•HR 3611 IH
(1) Online platforms have become integral to 
1
individuals’ full participation in economic, demo-
2
cratic, and societal processes. 
3
(2) Online platforms employ manipulative dark 
4
patterns, collect large amounts of personal informa-
5
tion from their users, and leverage that personal in-
6
formation for opaque algorithmic processes in ways 
7
that create vastly different experiences for different 
8
types of users. 
9
(3) Algorithmic processes are often used by on-
10
line platforms without adequate testing and in the 
11
absence of critical transparency requirements and 
12
other legally enforceable safety and efficacy stand-
13
ards, which has resulted in discrimination in hous-
14
ing, lending, job advertising, and other areas of op-
15
portunity. 
16
(4) The use of discriminatory algorithmic proc-
17
esses causes disproportionate harm to populations 
18
that already experience marginalization. 
19
(5) Online platforms constantly engage in con-
20
tent moderation decision making, resulting in highly 
21
influential outcomes regarding what content is visi-
22
ble and accessible to users. 
23
(6) Online platforms’ content moderation prac-
24
tices have disproportionately significant repercus-
25
23:49 Jul 07, 2021
H3611
3 
•HR 3611 IH
sions for members of marginalized communities, who 
1
have historically been the target of nefarious online 
2
activity, including disinformation campaigns. 
3
(7) Users of online platforms should have ac-
4
cess to understandable information about how online 
5
platforms moderate content and use algorithmic 
6
processes to amplify or recommend content. 
7
(8) Users of online platforms should be able to 
8
easily move their data to alternative online plat-
9
forms, and the importance of this right is particu-
10
larly significant given certain online platforms’ use 
11
of harmful algorithmic processes and engagement in 
12
ineffective content moderation. 
13
(9) In a variety of sectors, algorithmic proc-
14
esses also facilitate discriminatory outcomes on on-
15
line platforms that individuals may not personally 
16
interact with, but which nonetheless process the per-
17
sonal information of such individuals and have sig-
18
nificant, negative consequences. 
19
(10) The people of the United States would 
20
benefit from the convening of experts from a diverse 
21
set of governmental positions to collectively study 
22
and report on discriminatory algorithmic processes 
23
across the United States economy and society, with 
24
particular attention to intersections of harm.
