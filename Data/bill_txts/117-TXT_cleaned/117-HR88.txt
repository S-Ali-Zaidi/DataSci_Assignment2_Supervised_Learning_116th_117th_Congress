RESOLUTION 
Recognizing women’s cardiovascular health as a critical 
health care priority that affects every State and contrib-
utes to increased health care costs, and promoting the 
necessity of increased awareness of and education on 
the symptoms for heart disease among women, gender- 
specific cardiovascular disease research, and policy action 
to alleviate the risks of heart disease among women. 
Whereas heart disease is the number one killer of women in 
the United States;

Whereas heart disease accounts for the deaths of 400,000 
women each year or 1,080 each day; 
Whereas one in five women die of heart disease or stroke; 
Whereas the symptoms of heart disease and heart attack 
among women are different from those among men; 
Whereas the maternal mortality rate in the United States is 
rising with more than 700 women dying from pregnancy- 
related conditions each year, and cardiac disease and 
stroke, the leading cause of pregnancy-related deaths in 
the United States, is responsible for approximately 34 
percent of these losses; 
Whereas unrecognized symptoms and inadequate treatment 
of cardiovascular disease among women contribute to the 
increasing costs to the United States health care system, 
which, if left unaddressed, are projected to surpass $1 
trillion by 2035; 
Whereas heart attack symptoms among women are not typi-
cally recognized and can be as subtle as fatigue, jaw 
pain, shortness of breath, backache, and indigestion; 
Whereas half of all women experiencing heart attacks display 
none of the typically recognized male symptoms; 
Whereas 64 percent of women who die of coronary heart dis-
ease show no prior typically recognized symptoms; 
Whereas women are 50 percent more likely to receive an in-
correct diagnosis following a heart attack; 
Whereas despite gender differences in physiology and the 
manifestation of cardiovascular disease, women comprise 
only 36 percent of participants in cardiovascular disease 
studies that enroll both men and women; and

Whereas even when considering all cardiovascular disease-re-
lated studies, including single-sex studies, women still 
comprise only 38 percent of participants: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) recognizes the vital importance of decreas-
2
ing cardiovascular disease among women; 
3
(2) promotes the necessity of raising awareness 
4
of the preventable ubiquity of cardiovascular mor-
5
tality among women, and urges a comprehensive 
6
public awareness initiative that establishes best prac-
7
tices for identifying and treating cardiovascular inci-
8
dents in women, specifically; 
9
(3) supports efforts to educate women, men, pa-
10
tients, and physicians about the critical differences 
11
of cardiovascular disease symptoms between women 
12
and men; 
13
(4) supports the promotion of gender-specific 
14
cardiovascular health research, prevention, and 
15
treatment, because— 
16
(A) there is a material difference in the 
17
way women present with cardiovascular or 
18
heart attack symptoms; and 
19
(B) gender-specific cardiovascular research 
20
is essential to driving successful positive out-
21
comes in the reduction of mortality rates;

(5) affirms the connection between cardio-
1
vascular disease and preeclampsia in new mothers; 
2
(6) acknowledges that the costs to the health 
3
care system of unrecognized symptoms in the treat-
4
ment of women can be substantially reduced with 
5
appropriate public policy; and 
6
(7) supports the development of economic im-
7
pact data to ascertain the health care system costs 
8
to be saved by decreasing the incidents of death due 
9
to unrecognized symptoms of heart attack in women.
