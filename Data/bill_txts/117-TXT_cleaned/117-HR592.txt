RESOLUTION 
Honoring the Buffalo Soldiers who were dishonorably dis-
charged and ultimately had their honorable service re-
stored following events which occurred in 1906 in 
Brownsville, Texas. 
Whereas, on July 28, 1866, Congress established six all- 
Black regiments, known as the Buffalo Soldiers, to help 
rebuild the country after the Civil War and to patrol the 
remote western frontier during the Indian Wars and re-
mained active until the Army was desegregated in 1951; 
Whereas the Buffalo Soldiers received their name because of 
the buffalo’s fierce bravery and fighting spirit;

Whereas the Buffalo Soldiers fought alongside White regi-
ments in many conflicts and were instrumental in the ex-
ploration and settlement of western lands; 
Whereas Buffalo Soldiers were assigned to Fort Brown near 
the United States-Mexico border in 1906; 
Whereas following the death of a White bartender, 167 men 
serving in the all-Black 25th Infantry Regiment of the 
Army were dishonorably discharged by President Theo-
dore Roosevelt after being accused of shooting up the city 
of Brownsville, Texas, and the killing of a White man; 
Whereas these Buffalo Soldiers were not given a chance to 
defend themselves in legal proceedings and there was no 
evidence of these soldiers committing any crimes; 
Whereas the dishonorable discharge of the Buffalo Soldiers 
led to the loss of their pensions and inability to serve in 
Federal civil service jobs; 
Whereas the members of the 25th Infantry Regiment were 
accused of this shooting following growing tension be-
tween the White residents of Brownsville and the Black 
soldiers, making this accusation racially charged; 
Whereas, in 1972, the Army conducted a new investigation 
and withdrew the order of 1906, exonerating the Buffalo 
Soldiers and restoring their records to show that each left 
military service with an honorable discharge; and 
Whereas only one out of 167 Buffalo Soldiers falsely accused 
was alive by the time the original 1906 order was re-
versed, and no action was taken to provide compensation 
to their descendants: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
