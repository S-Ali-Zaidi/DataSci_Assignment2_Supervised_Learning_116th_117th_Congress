RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the designation of September 2022 
as ‘‘National Leading Entertainment and Arts through 
Diversity Month’’ or ‘‘National LEAD Month’’, and em-
powering underrepresented communities to take the lead

Whereas there should be more minority representation on and 
off the screen, and in main decision making roles that 
advance equity across industries; 
Whereas marginalized communities are defined as commu-
nities who experience discrimination and exclusion on the 
basis of race, gender, sexual orientation or identity, age,

Whereas, oftentimes, these sectors are erased from conversa-
tions, yet their distinctive perspectives and lived experi-
ences become the basis for more authentic storytelling; 
Whereas women only make up roughly 20 percent of directors 
and 26 percent of screenwriters; 
Whereas all minority groups make up 25 percent of directors 
and 25 percent of screenwriters; 
Whereas White film directors are more than twice as likely 
as minority directors to helm a film with a budget of 
$100,000,000 or more; 
Whereas roughly 18 percent of films produced by major stu-
dios feature LGBT+ stories; 
Whereas women over 30 make up 29 percent of female char-
acters and women over 40 make up 16 percent of female 
characters; 
Whereas 12 percent of television series characters are dis-
abled, and most portrayals are negative; 
Whereas it is critical to recognize the social and cultural im-
pact of diversity on television and the ramifications of 
underrepresentation; 
Whereas the importance of allyship is essential to promote in-
clusion across the entertainment industry as dominant 
groups have greater potential to help uplift their minority 
counterparts; 
Whereas allyship is defined as a lifelong process in which a 
member in a group of privilege and power actively seeks 
to unlearn misconceptions of a marginalized group in 
order to build relationships centered around trust, con-
sistency, and accountability;

Whereas allyship campaigns and programs are pivotal to the 
success of diversity programs, and yet are currently un-
dervalued in diversity, equity, and inclusion training; and 
Whereas adequate representation on television has been over-
looked for far too long, and, regardless of industry, we 
must remain dedicated to inclusion: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
