RESOLUTION 
Recognizing that Mississippi County, Arkansas, is the leader 
in electric arc furnace steel production. 
Whereas Mississippi County, Arkansas, is America’s largest 
producer of sustainable, recycled, scrap-based steel; 
Whereas Mississippi County’s steel industry has been built on 
a sustainable model of recycling steel to produce new 
steel and steel products that are 100-percent recyclable 
at the end of their useful life; 
Whereas Mississippi County’s steel producers utilize electric 
arc furnaces (EAFs) that melt recycled scrap and turn 
it into new steel; 
Whereas the EAF steelmaking process is far less carbon-in-
tensive and more energy efficient;

Whereas EAF steel producers in Arkansas produce steel with 
up to 75 percent fewer carbon emissions than traditional 
steelmaking; 
Whereas with lower carbon emissions and less energy re-
quired, the recycled steel produced in Mississippi County 
makes the county a building block for a green economy; 
Whereas Mississippi County’s steel producers are recycling 
the steel of the past and using it to build America’s fu-
ture; 
Whereas Mississippi County is home to the only steel produc-
tion facility to be LEED certified; 
Whereas Mississippi County’s modern steel producers con-
tinue to push recycled steel into products where it was 
never considered viable, such as 3d Generation Advanced 
High-Strength Steel (AHSS) products that make lighter, 
stronger, and more fuel-efficient vehicles with lower 
lifecycle emissions; 
Whereas 100 percent of Mississippi County’s steel is made in 
lower emissions, recycled, scrap-based EAFs, compared 
to only 28 percent of steel produced in the world and 10 
percent of steel produced in China being made in EAFs; 
and 
Whereas through recycling, Mississippi County is one of the 
cleanest places on Earth to make steel: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives recog-
1
nizes that Mississippi County, Arkansas, is the leader in 
2
electric arc furnace steel production.
