SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
1
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following find-
2
ings: 
3
(1) In 1986, President Ronald Reagan signed 
4
the Air Carrier Access Act of 1986 (Public Law 99– 
5
435; 100 Stat. 1080), adding a provision now codi-
6
fied in section 41705 of title 49, United States 
7
Code, prohibiting disability-based discrimination in 
8
air transportation. 
9
(2) Despite this effort, individuals with disabil-
10
ities continue to experience significant barriers to 
11
and with traveling in air transportation. 
12
(3) The Department of Transportation’s Airline 
13
Passengers with Disabilities Bill of Rights specifies 
14
that ‘‘airlines must accept a battery powered wheel-
15
chair, if it fits in the cargo compartment and can be 
16
transported consistent with safety and security re-
17
quirements’’. 
18
(4) Wheelchairs and other mobility aids pow-
19
ered by lithium-ion batteries are growing in preva-
20
lence, as lithium-ion batteries are light-weight and 
21
can extend a device’s range between charges. 
22
(5) Airline passengers with disabilities who 
23
travel with lithium-ion-powered wheelchairs or mobil-
24
ity aids have been arbitrarily and erroneously denied 
25

•HR 9342 IH
boarding despite presenting documentation that 
1
their devices meet all applicable safety standards. 
2
(6) As the popularity of lithium-ion-powered 
3
wheelchairs and mobility aids continues to increase, 
4
so will the frequency of instances when airline pas-
5
sengers with disabilities are erroneously and arbi-
6
trarily denied boarding. 
7
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
8
gress that an air carrier or foreign air carrier that denies 
9
an airline passenger with a disability who use a lithium- 
10
ion-powered wheelchair or mobility aid that meets all ap-
11
plicable safety standards for air travel should be consid-
12
ered to have violated such passenger’s rights under section 
13
41705 of title 49, United States Code, and therefore, all 
14
air carriers and foreign air carriers must maintain clear 
15
policies pertaining to lithium-ion battery-powered wheel-
16
chairs and mobility aids that are no more restrictive than 
17
all applicable safety standards.
