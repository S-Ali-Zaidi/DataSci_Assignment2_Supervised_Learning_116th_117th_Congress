SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) NASA uses enhanced-use leasing to enter 
3
into agreements with private sector entities, State 
4
and local governments, academic institutions, and 
5
other Federal agencies for lease of non-excess, un-
6
derutilized NASA properties and facilities. 
7
(2) NASA uses enhanced-use leasing authority 
8
to support responsible management of its real prop-
9
erty, including to improve the use of underutilized 
10
property for activities that are compatible with 
11
NASA’s mission and to reduce facility operating and 
12
maintenance costs. 
13
(3) In fiscal year 2019, under its enhanced-use 
14
lease authority, NASA leased 65 real properties. 
15
(4) In fiscal year 2019, NASA’s use of en-
16
hanced-use leasing resulted in the collection of 
17
$10,843,025.77 in net revenue. 
18
(5) In fiscal year 2019, NASA used a portion 
19
of its enhanced-use leasing revenues for repairs of 
20
facility control systems such as lighting and heating, 
21
ventilation, and air conditioning. 
22
(6) NASA’s use of enhanced-use leasing author-
23
ity can contribute to reducing the rate of increase of 
24
the Agency’s overall deferred maintenance cost.
