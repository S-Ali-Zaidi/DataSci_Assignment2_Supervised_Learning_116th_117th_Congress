Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The industrialization of developing nations 
3
has driven demand for nonfuel minerals necessary 
4
for 
telecommunications, 
military 
technologies, 
5
healthcare technologies, and conventional and renew-
6
able energy technologies. 
7
(2) The availability of minerals and mineral 
8
materials are essential for economic growth, national 
9
security, technological innovation, and the manufac-
10
turing and agricultural supply chain. 
11
(3) Minerals and mineral materials are critical 
12
components of every transportation, water, tele-
13
communications, and energy infrastructure project 
14
necessary to modernize the crumbling infrastructure 
15
of the United States. 
16
(4) The exploration, production, processing, 
17
use, and recycling of minerals contribute signifi-
18
cantly to the economic well-being, security, and gen-
19
eral welfare of the United States. 
20
(5) Constraints on mineral supply chains are 
21
expected to grow globally due to increased demand, 
22
leading to higher costs of raw materials necessary 
23
for innovative technologies to combat climate 
24
change.

(6) China currently controls the majority of 
1
worldwide production of certain minerals, includ-
2
ing— 
3
(A) rare earth minerals; 
4
(B) graphite and graphene; 
5
(C) lithium; and 
6
(D) vanadium. 
7
(7) Domestic mineral production must grow to 
8
allow the United States to fulfill its national secu-
9
rity, healthcare, infrastructure, energy, manufac-
10
turing, agricultural, and environmental needs. 
11
(8) In order to ensure the United States re-
12
mains economically competitive, domestic production 
13
of 
minerals 
and 
mineral 
materials 
must 
be 
14
prioritized and bolstered through reducing existing 
15
constraints on mineral access. 
16
(9) As of 2020, the United States is entirely 
17
import dependent for 17 key mineral resources, and 
18
more than 50 percent import dependent for an addi-
19
tional 29 mineral commodities. United States min-
20
eral import reliance has nearly doubled over the past 
21
20 years. 
22
(10) The United States permitting process— 
23
which takes on average 7 to 10 years or more—is 
24
one of the principal barriers to the domestic mining
