•HRES 474 IH 
Whereas since Israel’s founding in 1948, Congress has re-
peatedly expressed our Nation’s unwavering commitment 
to the security of Israel; 
Whereas as a sovereign country, Israel has the right and re-
sponsibility to protect itself and its citizens from all 
forms of terrorism; 
Whereas Hamas was designated by the Department of State 
as a foreign terrorist organization on October 8, 1997; 
Whereas Hamas is actively engaged in committing war 
crimes, including using civilians as human shields, which 
is banned under customary international humanitarian 
law; 
Whereas Hamas and its Palestinian terrorist allies in Gaza 
have fired hundreds of rockets into Israel at nonmilitary 
targets since the week of May 9, 2021; 
Whereas civilians, including women and children, have been 
killed as a direct result from the actions of Hamas; 
Whereas Hamas and its Palestinian terrorist allies in Gaza 
are funded by Iran; 
Whereas Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New 
York, Representative Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, Rep-
resentative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, and Representative 
Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts have each referred to 
Israel as an ‘‘apartheid state’’; 
Whereas Representative Omar equated the United States and 
Israel with Hamas and the Taliban when stating ‘‘We 
must have the same level of accountability and justice for 
all victims of crimes against humanity. We have seen un-
thinkable atrocities committed by the U.S., Hamas, 
Israel, Afghanistan, and the Taliban.’’;

•HRES 474 IH 
Whereas Representative Tlaib accused the Government of 
Israel of ‘‘ethnic cleansing’’ against Palestinians; 
Whereas Representative Tlaib claimed that Israel, our demo-
cratic ally, is ‘‘promoting racism and dehumanization’’; 
Whereas Representative Omar argued that Israel’s military 
response to Hamas’s strikes was ‘‘an act of terrorism’’ 
rather than an act of self defense; 
Whereas Representative Omar accused the United States of 
backing crimes against humanity; 
Whereas Representative Ocasio-Cortez claimed the Israeli 
military is ‘‘inhumane’’ and responsible for ‘‘inflicting vi-
olence’’; 
Whereas Representative Ocasio-Cortez accused the Govern-
ment of Israel of committing ‘‘human rights abuses’’; 
Whereas Representative Pressley equated any support of our 
democratic ally to supporting oppression, violence, and 
apartheid; 
Whereas Representative Pressley accused Israel of ‘‘egregious 
human rights violations’’; 
Whereas each of the claims made by Representatives Ocasio- 
Cortez, Tlaib, Omar, and Pressley inaccurately depict the 
democracy of Israel as an oppressive, violent, abusive na-
tion; 
Whereas these claims publicly support the actions of a recog-
nized terrorist organization over the defense of one of our 
long-time allies; and 
Whereas these false claims, further perpetuated over social 
media, have resulted in increased violence and anti-Se-
mitic hate crimes throughout the United States: Now, 
therefore, be it
