Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Fire Fauci Act’’.

SEC. 2 FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 2316 IH
(1) The Director of the National Institute of 
1
Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Dr. An-
2
thony Fauci, M.D., earned $434,312 in 2020. 
3
(2) Dr. Fauci is not only the highest paid doc-
4
tor in the Federal Government, but the highest paid 
5
of any of the 4,000,000 Federal employees, includ-
6
ing the President. 
7
(3) Part IV of the Executive Schedule generally 
8
caps government salaries at $172,500, but Dr. 
9
Fauci’s salary is much higher due to an exception 
10
put in place to make Federal salaries for doctors 
11
and scientists more competitive with the private sec-
12
tor. 
13
(4) The role of the Director of the NIAID is to 
14
‘‘provide scientific leadership, policy guidance, and 
15
overall operational and administrative coordination 
16
for the Institute’’. 
17
(5) NIAID is funded by American taxpayer dol-
18
lars and, as part of the National Institutes of 
19
Health, seeks to apply scientific knowledge to ‘‘en-
20
hance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and 
21
disability’’. 
22
(6) Dr. Anthony Fauci has continually failed to 
23
provide Americans with accurate information about 
24

•HR 2316 IH
the COVID–19 pandemic and has shown distrust in 
1
the American private sector and American ingenuity. 
2
(7) In March 2020, Dr. Fauci told Americans 
3
not to wear masks, noting: ‘‘There’s no reason to be 
4
walking around with a mask. When you are in the 
5
middle of an outbreak, wearing a mask might make 
6
people feel a little bit better and it might even block 
7
a droplet, but it is not providing the perfect protec-
8
tion that people think that it is. And, often, there 
9
are unintended consequences—people keep fiddling 
10
with the mask and they keep touching their face.’’. 
11
(8) Now, more than a year later, he is telling 
12
Americans to continue quarantining as much as pos-
13
sible and to wear a mask, maybe even into the year 
14
2022. 
15
(9) According to the Centers for Disease Con-
16
trol and Prevention, the vaccines have been ‘‘highly 
17
effective’’ at preventing infection. Research from 
18
Johns Hopkins Medicine has shown that the vaccine 
19
is 95 percent effective, and also works to prevent se-
20
rious illness in the 1 in 20 people who may contract 
21
COVID–19 
after 
being 
vaccinated. 
Over 
22
100,000,000 vaccines have now been administered, 
23
and some studies show that those who have already 
24
contracted COVID–19 may only need 1 dose of the 
25

vaccine to prevent reinfection rather than the 2 pre-
1
scribed. Despite these outcomes and his previous 
2
comments, Dr. Fauci has reversed course and is now 
3
sounding the alarm on COVID–19 variants, com-
4
menting: ‘‘The way we can counter [the UK vari-
5
ant], which is a growing threat in our country, is to 
6
do two things: to get as many people vaccinated as 
7
quickly and as expeditiously as possible with the vac-
8
cine that we know works against this variant and, 
9
finally, to implement the public health measures that 
10
we talk about all the time . . . masking, physical 
11
distancing and avoiding congregant settings, particu-
12
larly indoors.’’. 
13
(10) Dr. Fauci also now claims that herd im-
14
munity will require 80 to 85 percent of Americans 
15
to get the vaccine. 
16
(11) Dr. Fauci did not believe that American 
17
companies such as Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & 
18
Johnson would be able to produce an effective vac-
19
cine. In August 2020, he stated that the vaccine 
20
might only be 50 percent effective.
