It is the sense of Congress that— 
7
(1) many women find themselves with an unex-
8
pected pregnancy without knowledge of what re-
9
sources might be available to them at the local, 
10
State, and Federal levels to support emotional, phys-
11

encounter during pregnancy, childbirth, and child- 
1
rearing; 
2
(2) gaps exist in support and services provided 
3
throughout communities; 
4
(3) Federal and State governments, according 
5
to the Supreme Court ruling in Harris v. McRae, 
6
448 U.S. 297 (1980), have a vested interest in as-
7
suring optimal support and outcomes for women and 
8
their children, and this ruling supports the decided 
9
interest of the United States Government to help a 
10
woman through childbirth and child-rearing; 
11
(4) women and communities alike have univer-
12
sally voiced the need for safe, affordable, and sup-
13
portive housing for expectant mothers; 
14
(5) maternity housing needs in rural and urban 
15
communities differ, and, as a result, community 
16
needs should be evaluated and gaps filled where lack 
17
of housing support and services exist; 
18
(6) group housing has been shown to be valu-
19
able to improve health outcomes; 
20
(7) institutions of higher education should pro-
21
vide information regarding resources available for 
22
parenting and pregnant students;

•HR 5163 IH
(8) communities should work together to pro-
1
vide support and services, and fulfill unmet needs of 
2
pregnant and parenting students; 
3
(9) expectant mothers begin to provide for their 
4
child as soon as they come to learn of their preg-
5
nancy, and expenses may include clothing, furniture, 
6
toys, and food, and, for this reason, a child tax cred-
7
it for women who are pregnant should be applied; 
8
(10) information on support and services avail-
9
able should be readily available to women during 
10
pregnancy, birth, and child-rearing; 
11
(11) health care services are covered through 
12
various insurances including the Medicaid program; 
13
(12) linking health care services to broader sup-
14
port and services for a mother and her child, includ-
15
ing housing, nutrition, education, job training, job 
16
placement, and childcare, is critical to help facilitate 
17
a woman through her journey; 
18
(13) a committed community of care working 
19
with State and Federal governments has an oppor-
20
tunity to build comprehensive support systems that 
21
improve pregnancy outcomes significantly; 
22
(14) a community of care can help with—

with an unexpected pregnancy, to fill additional gaps 
13
that exist in support and services, and to support ex-
14
