A BILL 
To protect State and Federal courts’ primary and inherent 
authority to regulate and oversee the legal profession 
by prohibiting Federal agencies from regulating licensed 
attorneys and law firms engaged in litigation activities, 
prohibiting opposing parties in legal actions from bring-
ing private rights of action against such attorneys and 
law firms for their litigation activities, and for other 
purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Restoring Court Au-
2
thority Over Litigation Act of 2022’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
4
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) For many decades, attorneys engaged in the 
6
practice of law have been regulated and disciplined 
7
primarily by the highest court of the State in which 
8
the attorney is licensed or admitted to practice, at-
9
torney disciplinary agencies overseen by those 
10
courts, and other State and Federal courts of com-
11
petent jurisdiction pursuant to the applicable stat-
12
utes, rules of civil procedure, and rules of profes-
13
sional conduct and disciplinary procedure duly 
14
adopted in those jurisdictions, and not by Congress, 
15
Federal agencies, or private litigants. 
16
(2) State supreme courts have promulgated and 
17
enforced extensive and effective regulations gov-
18
erning all aspects of the practice of law, including 
19
admission requirements, strict attorney rules of pro-
20
fessional conduct, disciplinary rules, and litigation 
21
procedural rules. In addition, Federal courts have 
22
adopted local rules governing the conduct of attor-
23
neys appearing before them. As a result, State and 
24
Federal courts have extensive authority and tools to 
25
address attorney misconduct that occurs during the 
26
00:15 Dec 07, 2022

•HR 9393 IH
course of litigation before them, including monetary 
1
sanctions, striking offending pleadings or other pa-
2
pers, or referring the matter to disciplinary authori-
3
ties, which could lead to a reprimand, censure, li-
4
cense suspension, disbarment, or other available dis-
5
ciplinary sanctions. 
6
(3) Consistent with the longstanding principle 
7
of judicial regulation and oversight of attorneys and 
8
the legal profession, numerous Federal agencies have 
9
included broad practice of law exclusions in major 
10
rules, including the Federal Trade Commission’s 
11
‘‘Mortgage Assistance Relief Services’’ Rule issued 
12
in November 2010 and the Department of Housing 
13
and Urban Development’s ‘‘Secure and Fair En-
14
forcement for Mortgage Licensing Act’’ Rule issued 
15
in June 2011. 
16
(4) Also consistent with the principle of judicial 
17
regulation of attorneys and the legal profession, 
18
Congress has generally declined to enact legislation 
19
regulating the practice of law, including litigation 
20
activities of attorneys. 
21
(5) Congress has also incorporated broad prac-
22
tice of law exclusions into certain Federal statutes. 
23
For example, section 1027(e) of the Consumer Fi-
24
nancial Protection Act of 2010 excludes most attor-
25
00:15 Dec 07, 2022
H9393

•HR 9393 IH
neys engaged in the practice of law from the Con-
1
sumer Financial Protection Bureau’s regulatory and 
2
enforcement authority, while the Fair Debt Collec-
3
tion Practices Act of 1977 originally contained a 
4
complete exemption for attorneys engaged in the 
5
practice of law. 
6
(6) Although Congress removed the complete 
7
attorney exemption from the Fair Debt Collection 
8
Practices Act in 1986 based in part on its belief that 
9
the revised Act would only apply to attorneys’ non- 
10
litigation collection activities and that State courts 
11
would continue to regulate attorneys’ litigation ac-
12
tivities, the United States Supreme Court held in 
13
Heintz v. Jenkins, 514 U.S. 291 (1995), that attor-
14
neys could be subject to the Act even when they are 
15
engaged in litigation activities. As a result, many at-
16
torneys now are routinely sued for litigation activi-
17
ties in State court that are alleged to be technical 
18
violations of the Act, even when consumers suffer no 
19
harm. 
20
(7) In each of its annual reports to Congress on 
21
the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act from 1998 
22
through 2006, the Federal Trade Commission for-
23
mally recommended that Congress reexamine and 
24
amend the definition of ‘‘debt collector’’ in the Act 
25
00:15 Dec 07, 2022
H9393

•HR 9393 IH
to exempt ‘‘attorneys who pursue debtors solely 
1
through litigation (or similar ‘legal’ practices).’’ 
2
(8) In recent years, the Consumer Financial 
3
Protection Bureau has also aggressively sought to 
4
regulate attorneys’ collection activities, including 
5
their litigation activities, despite the broad practice 
6
of law exclusion in section 1027(e) of the Consumer 
7
Financial Protection Act. The Bureau’s aggressive 
8
actions could also lead to other Federal agencies 
9
adopting rules or practices regulating attorneys’ liti-
10
gation activities in other types of court cases. 
11
(9) These developments have undermined State 
12
and Federal courts’ primary and inherent authority 
13
to regulate and oversee attorneys engaged in the 
14
practice of law by creating multiple conflicting sets 
15
of rules and standards for attorneys, resulting in un-
16
fair lawsuits against attorneys pursuing valid legal 
17
claims for clients in court, increased attorney mal-
18
practice insurance rates, difficulty in obtaining legal 
19
representation, and reduced access to justice. 
20
(10) On January 26, 2011, the Conference of 
21
Chief Justices adopted Resolution 1 (‘‘In Support of 
22
Preserving Traditional State Court Regulation of 
23
Lawyers and Opposing Expanded Federal Agency 
24
Regulation of Lawyers and the Practice of Law’’), 
25
00:15 Dec 07, 2022
H9393
6 
•HR 9393 IH
affirming that primary regulation and oversight of 
1
attorneys and the legal profession should continue to 
2
be vested in the State courts, not Federal agencies 
3
or Congress, and that the courts are in the best po-
4
sition to fulfill that important function. The Resolu-
5
tion also expressed support for Congress and Fed-
6
eral agencies’ decisions to include broad practice of 
7
law exclusions in certain Federal statutes and agen-
8
cy rules, and opposition to Federal legislation or 
9
rules intended to establish or expand the Federal 
10
regulatory jurisdiction of attorneys engaged in the 
11
practice of law. 
12
(11) While the activities constituting the prac-
13
tice of law are determined by the State in which an 
14
attorney is licensed or admitted to practice, litiga-
15
tion activities in connection with a legal action in 
16
State or Federal court are considered to be part of 
17
the practice of law in every State. 
18
(12) To protect and restore State and Federal 
19
courts’ primary and inherent authority to regulate 
20
and oversee attorneys and the legal profession, Fed-
21
eral legislation is needed to clarify that— 
22
(A) attorneys engaged in litigation should 
23
be regulated and disciplined exclusively by State 
24
supreme courts, their attorney disciplinary

1
competent jurisdiction; 
2
(B) Federal agencies shall have no regu-
3
latory authority over litigation activities of at-
4
torneys; and 
5
(C) no party in a legal action shall have a 
6
Federal private right of action against the op-
7
posing attorney for the attorney’s litigation ac-
8
tivities. 
9
(13) On February 5, 2020, the Conference of 
10
Chief Justices also adopted a second Resolution 1, 
11
entitled ‘‘In Support of Preserving the Courts’ Au-
12
thority to Regulate and Oversee Lawyers Engaged 
13
in Litigation and Opposing Federal Agency Regula-
14
tion of Lawyers’ Litigation Activities’’, which ex-
15
pressed support for Federal legislation that would 
16
implement the three proposed reforms described in 
17
paragraph (12). 
18
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
19
gress that attorneys engaged in litigation activities should 
20
be regulated and disciplined exclusively by the courts and 
21
other authorities of the State in which the attorney is li-

censed or admitted to practice, attorney disciplinary agen-
23
cies overseen by those courts, and other State and Federal
