A BILL 
To expand and enhance existing adult day programs for 
younger people with neurological diseases or conditions 
(such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, trau-
matic brain injury, or other similar diseases or condi-
tions) to support and improve access to respite services 
for family caregivers who are taking care of such people, 
and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Adult Day Center En-
4
hancement Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
The Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) One in 6 people in the United States lives 
3
with a neurological disease or condition that can 
4
often result in disability, and which may require the 
5
individual to seek assistance in carrying out the ac-
6
tivities of daily living. Neurological diseases or condi-
7
tions such as multiple sclerosis (MS), early-onset 
8
Parkinson’s disease, and traumatic brain injury 
9
(TBI) can also typically affect younger adults in the 
10
middle of their lives. 
11
(2) Multiple sclerosis is a chronic, often dis-
12
abling disease that attacks the central nervous sys-
13
tem with symptoms ranging from numbness in limbs 
14
to paralysis and loss of vision. Most people with MS 
15
are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50 years 
16
of age. MS is a leading cause of disability in young 
17
adults. Persons living with MS who experience more 
18
severe forms of the disease are likely to require ei-
19
ther home care or nursing home placement, though 
20
the vast majority would prefer to remain at home to 
21
receive the care they need. Where home care is con-
22
cerned, approximately 80 percent of such care is 
23
provided by unpaid caregivers who are generally 
24
family members.

(3) Parkinson’s disease is a chronic, progressive 
1
neurological disease. The four primary symptoms of 
2
Parkinson’s disease are tremor, or trembling in 
3
hands, arms, legs, jaw, and face; rigidity, or stiffness 
4
of the limbs and trunk; bradykinesia, or slowness of 
5
movement; and postural instability, or impaired bal-
6
ance and coordination. Other symptoms may include 
7
cognitive changes; difficulty in swallowing, chewing, 
8
and speaking; urinary problems or constipation; skin 
9
problems; and sleep disruptions. As these symptoms 
10
become more pronounced, patients may have dif-
11
ficulty walking, talking, or completing other simple 
12
tasks. It is estimated that nearly 1,000,000,000 
13
Americans will be living with Parkinson’s by 2020 
14
and of those 5 to 10 percent are diagnosed younger 
15
than 50 and deemed ‘‘early-onset’’. 
16
(4) Traumatic brain injury is a neurological 
17
condition that typically results from a blow or jolt to 
18
the head or a penetrating head injury and that can 
19
impact one or more parts of the brain, thereby tem-
20
porarily or permanently disrupting normal brain 
21
function. The Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
22
vention estimates that 153 Americans die from TBI 
23
every day, and that TBIs contribute to approxi-
24
mately 30 percent of all injury deaths. Traumatic 
25
01:00 Feb 05, 2021
H253
4 
•HR 253 IH
brain injury is also a serious issue that affects mili-
1
tary servicemembers. Estimates in prior military 
2
conflicts indicate that TBI was present in 14–20 
3
percent of surviving casualties. 
4
(5) Family caregivers are a crucial source of 
5
support and assistance for individuals suffering with 
6
disabilities. Family caregivers, the majority of whom 
7
are women, provide an estimated $470,000,000,000 
8
in unpaid services annually. The supply of family 
9
caregivers is unlikely to keep pace with future de-
10
mand. The caregiver support ratio of potential care-
11
givers aged 45 to 64 for each person aged 80 and 
12
older, for instance, is 7 to 1 in 2010, 4 to 1 in 2030, 
13
and 3 to 1 in 2050. 
14
(6) The majority of family caregivers (or 54 
15
percent) are caring for someone ages 18 to 74. 
16
Forty-six percent of family caregivers are caring for 
17
someone 75 or older. 
18
(7) Adult day programs can offer services, in-
19
cluding medical care, rehabilitation therapies, dig-
20
nified assistance with the activities of daily living, 
21
nutrition therapy, health monitoring, social inter-
22
action, stimulating activities, and transportation to 
23
seniors, people with disabilities, and younger adults 
24
with chronic diseases.

(8) Adult day programs geared toward people 
1
living with neurological diseases or conditions such 
2
as MS, Parkinson’s disease, TBI, or other similar 
3
diseases or conditions provide an important response 
4
to the needs of people living with these conditions 
5
and their family caregivers. Adult day programs can 
6
help to ameliorate symptoms, reduce dependency, 
7
provide important socialization opportunities, and 
8
maintain quality of life. 
9
(9) Adult day programs have been shown to 
10
provide a range of documented benefits including 
11
improvements in functional status, social support, 
12
and reductions in fatigue, depression and pain. 
13
Adult day programs also reduce ongoing medical 
14
care and hospital costs and decrease admissions to 
15
nursing home facilities, which can be costly for many 
16
families, by allowing individuals to receive health 
17
and social services while continuing to live at home. 
18
(10) There are currently few adult day pro-
19
grams focused on younger adult populations in the 
20
United States. Although young people living with 
21
neurological diseases or conditions may be able to 
22
access existing adult day programs, such programs 
23
are not typically intended for younger adults living 
24
with chronic diseases or conditions, and may not
