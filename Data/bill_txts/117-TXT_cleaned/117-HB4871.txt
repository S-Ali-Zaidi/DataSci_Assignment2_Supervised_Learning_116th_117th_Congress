(1) One of the main missions of the Federal 
1
Communications Commission, and a compelling gov-
2
ernmental interest, is to ensure that there is a diver-
3
sity of ownership and viewpoints in the broadcasting 
4
industry. 
5
(2) The Commission should continue to collect 
6
relevant data and conduct studies on such diversity, 
7
adopt improvements to the data collection and stud-
8
ies, and make appropriate recommendations to Con-
9
gress on how to increase the number of minority- 
10
and women-owned broadcast stations. 
11
(3) Data from 2017 shows that, of the nearly 
12
1,700 full-power commercial broadcast television sta-
13
tions in the United States, less than 6 percent are 
14
owned by women, and less than 3 percent are minor-
15
ity-owned. With respect to the nearly 5,500 full- 
16
power commercial broadcast radio stations, women 
17
owned approximately 7 percent of FM broadcast 
18
radio stations, and minorities owned less than 3 per-
19
cent of such stations. 
20
(4) Women and minority ownership is 5 to 10 
21
times higher in other industries than in the broad-
22
casting industry.

(5) During the 17 years that a minority tax 
24
certificate program was in place at the Commission
