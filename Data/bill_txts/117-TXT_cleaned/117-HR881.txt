RESOLUTION 
Condemning the heinous terrorist attack on Congregation 
Beth Israel in Colleyville, Texas, on January 15, 2022. 
Whereas, on January 15, 2022, Malik Faisal Akram entered 
Congregation Beth Israel in Colleyville, Texas, taking 
four individuals hostage; 
Whereas MI5, Britain’s counterintelligence and security agen-
cy investigated Mr. Akram in 2020, and he was listed as 
a subject of interest, but was later determined to no 
longer pose a threat; 
Whereas Mr. Akram arrived at New York’s John F. Kennedy 
Airport on December 29, 2021, staying in New York City 
for two days until taking a flight to Dallas, Texas; 
Whereas it is reported Mr. Akram chose the synagogue be-
cause it appeared to be the closest gathering of Jewish 
people to a Federal prison where he demanded to see a 
woman who is in custody after being found guilty of two 
counts of attempted murder, armed assault, using and 
carrying a firearm, and three counts of assault on United 
States officers and employees in Afghanistan; 
Whereas according to the Anti-Defamation League, in 2020 
and 2021, there were 8,366 incidents of extremism or 
antisemitism in the United States; 
Whereas more than half of the religiously motivated hate 
crimes reported to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 
2020 were anti-Jewish hate crimes; 
Whereas Jewish Americans make up about two percent of the 
country’s population but they make up 55 percent of the 
country’s anti-religious hate crimes;

Whereas, on Sunday, January 16, 2022, President Joe Biden 
classified this attack as an act of terror and Vice Presi-
dent Kamala Harris affirmed we should combat anti-
semitism and hate wherever it exists; 
Whereas the four hostages were held for nearly 11 hours, 
during that time Rabbi Charlie Cytron-Walker used the 
skills he learned by attending several security courses 
hosted by local law enforcement, the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation, the Anti-Defamation League, and the Se-
cure Community Network; 
Whereas Good Shepherd Catholic Community church pro-
vided support and housed family members of the wor-
shipers held inside the Synagogue during the 11 hour 
standoff; 
Whereas Pleasant Run Baptist Church offered their thoughts 
and support during the standoff, and allowed for their 
parking lot to be used by the media; 
Whereas worshipers who were watching service virtually con-
tacted local law enforcement once they realized there was 
an incident underway at Congregation Beth Israel; and 
Whereas because of the swift response from local, State, and 
Federal law enforcement officers and emergency respond-
ers on the ground, no hostages were harmed during the 
hostage situation: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
