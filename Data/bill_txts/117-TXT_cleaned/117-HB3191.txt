SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress makes the following findings: 
2
(1) The Department of State released a fact 
3
sheet on January 15, 2021, about the Wuhan Insti-
4
tute of Virology (WIV) which stated the following: 
5
(A) ‘‘The U.S. government has reason to 
6
believe that several researchers inside the WIV 
7
became sick in autumn 2019, before the first 
8
identified case of the outbreak, with symptoms 
9
consistent with both COVID–19 and common 
10
seasonal illnesses.’’. 
11
(B) ‘‘WIV researchers conducted experi-
12
ments involving RaTG13, the bat coronavirus 
13
identified by the WIV in January 2020 as its 
14
closest sample to SARS-CoV-2.’’. 
15
(C) ‘‘Despite the WIV presenting itself as 
16
a civilian institution, the United States has de-
17
termined that the WIV has collaborated on pub-
18
lications and secret projects with China’s mili-
19
tary.’’. 
20
(2) Former Director of the Centers for Disease 
21
Control and Prevention, Robert Redfield, stated in 
22
March 2021 that, ‘‘the most likely etiology of this 
23
pathogen in Wuhan was from a laboratory’’ and 
24
noted that, ‘‘[i]t is not unusual for respiratory

pathogens that are being worked on in a laboratory 
1
to infect the laboratory worker.’’. 
2
(3) Director-General of the World Health Orga-
3
nization Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus acknowl-
4
edged in March 2021 that the Coronavirus Disease 
5
2019 (COVID–19) may have originated in a labora-
6
tory and said this hypothesis ‘‘requires further inves-
7
tigation, potentially with additional missions involv-
8
ing specialist experts.’’. 
9
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
10
It is the sense of Congress that— 
11
(1) identifying the origin of Coronavirus Dis-
12
ease 2019 (COVID–19) is critical for preventing a 
13
similar pandemic from occurring in the future; 
14
(2) there is reason to believe the COVID–19 
15
pandemic may have originated at the Wuhan Insti-
16
tute of Virology; and 
17
(3) the Director of National Intelligence should 
18
declassify and make available to the public as much 
19
information as possible about the origin of COVID– 
20
19 so the United States and like-minded countries 
21
can— 
22
(A) identify the origin of COVID–19 as ex-
23
peditiously as possible, and 
24

(B) use that information to take all appro-
1
priate measures to prevent a similar pandemic 
2
from occurring again.

SEC. 4. DECLASSIFICATION OF INFORMATION RELATED TO 
4
THE ORIGIN OF COVID–19. 
5
Not later than 90 days after the date of the enact-

ment of this Act, the Director of National Intelligence 
7
shall— 
8
(1) declassify any and all information relating 
9

10
rology and the origin of the Coronavirus Disease 
11

and 
19
(C) researchers at the Wuhan Institute of

14

15
(A) all of the information described under
