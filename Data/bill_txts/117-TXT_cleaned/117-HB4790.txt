Congress finds the following:

•HR 4790 IH
(1) Article III, section 1 of the Constitution of 
1
the United States establishes the Supreme Court of 
2
the United States. The Constitution states that the 
3
Supreme Court has both original and appellate juris-
4
dictions. 
5
(2) The best-known power of the Supreme 
6
Court is judicial review, or the ability of the Court 
7
to declare a legislative or executive act in violation 
8
of the Constitution. 
9
(3) Members of the Armed Forces are typically 
10
denied certiorari review if the United States Court 
11
of Appeals for the Armed Forces refuses to grant a 
12
petition for review. Thus, the ability to seek justice 
13
with respect to the rulings of courts-martial has 
14
been stunted due to an arbitrary and capricious rule. 
15
(4) Furthermore, detainees at United States 
16
Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba are granted 
17
unfettered discretionary access to the Supreme 
18
Court under writs of certiorari as displayed under 
19
Rasul v. Bush and Al Odah v. United States. 
20
(5) Considering the aforementioned cases and 
21
in the interest of justice and accountability, this Act 
22
modifies the Uniform Code of Military Justice and 
23
section 1259 of title 28, United States Code, to 
24
allow for certiorari review of certain cases denied re-
