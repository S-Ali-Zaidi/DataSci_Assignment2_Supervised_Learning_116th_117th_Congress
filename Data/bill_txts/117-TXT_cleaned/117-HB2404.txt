memorative Coin Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
The Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Cesar Chavez was born on March 31, 1927, 
8
in Yuma, Arizona.

(2) In 1962, Chavez founded the National 
1
Farm Workers Association, which later became the 
2
United Farm Workers, to improve the wages and 
3
working conditions for American farmworkers. 
4
(3) Chavez’s union drew on the imagery of civil 
5
rights to use nonviolence and mass mobilization to 
6
improve the conditions of persecuted and impover-
7
ished American workers. 
8
(4) Chavez believed that preventing illegal im-
9
migration was an essential prerequisite to improving 
10
the circumstances of American farmworkers. 
11
(5) In 1969, Chavez led a march to the Mexi-
12
can border to protest illegal immigration, joined by 
13
Senator Walter Mondale and Martin Luther King’s 
14
successor as head of the Southern Christian Leader-
15
ship Conference, Ralph Abernathy. 
16
(6) Chavez noted that it is ‘‘almost impossible 
17
to start some effective program to get these people 
18
their jobs back from the braceros’’ once employers 
19
replace them. 
20
(7) In the 1970s, Chavez combined a campaign 
21
of identifying and reporting illegal workers with a 
22
campaign to boycott nonunionized farms in order to 
23
protect the labor of the unionized American worker.

(8) Chavez recognized that flooding the labor 
1
market with people from abroad undermines the 
2
unionized American worker. 
3
(9) In 1979, at the National Press Club, Cha-
4
vez emphatically supported enforcement of immigra-
5
tion laws, stating that ‘‘people are being hurt and 
6
being destroyed, and with the complicity and with 
7
the help, of the Federal Government’’. 
8
(10) President Clinton recognized Chavez’s 
9
work saying, ‘‘We can be proud of his enormous ac-
10
complishments and in the dignity and comfort he 
11
brought to the lives of so many of our country’s 
12
least powerful and most dispossessed workers.’’.
