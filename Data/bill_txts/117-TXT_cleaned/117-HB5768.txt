•HR 5768 IH
(1) Research indicates that law enforcement 
1
agencies can impact clearance rates by improving in-
2
vestigative processes, detective effort, and organiza-
3
tional oversight and supervision of investigations. 
4
(2) Law enforcement agencies that demonstrate 
5
higher rates of clearance for homicides and non-fatal 
6
shootings— 
7
(A) have more structured oversight and 
8
formal interactions between investigative units 
9
and agency leadership; 
10

11
units that have good relationships with other 
12
units and that share information well with 
13
other units; 
14
(C) have investigative units that have spe-
15
cific goals and performance metrics for both the 
16
unit and for investigators within that unit; tend 
17
to assign most, if not all, serious crimes to an 
18
investigator, at least for preliminary review; 
19
(D) have investigators who more frequently 
20
respond to the initial crime scene shortly after 
21
crimes have been reported; 
22
(E) have investigators who either have (or 
23
are required to have) specialized experience be-
24
fore joining investigative units or are expected

to be trained on specific skills once they join 
1
those units;

3
dures for investigations, where cases are man-
4
aged carefully and have requirements for com-
5
pletion;

(G) tend to support their investigative 
7
units, both in terms of resources, as well as 
8
symbolically; and 
9
(H) have better relationships with their 
10
community, even if no specific community-ori-
11
ented campaign or initiative exists between in-
12
vestigative units and community groups. 
13
(3) Criminal justice agencies should collaborate 
14
among each other and share best practices for solv-
15
ing homicides and non-fatal shootings. 
16
(4) A comprehensive community engagement 
17
strategy concerning gun violence is essential to im-
18
prove clearance rates for homicides and non-fatal 
19
shootings.
