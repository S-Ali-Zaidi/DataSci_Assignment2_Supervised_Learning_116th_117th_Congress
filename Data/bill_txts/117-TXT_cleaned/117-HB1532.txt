(1) affordable homeownership opportunities are 
1
being hindered due to the lack of financing available 
2
for home purchases under $70,000; 
3
(2) according to the Urban Institute, small-dol-
4
lar mortgage loan applications in 2017 were denied 
5
by lenders at double the rate of denial for large 
6
mortgage loans, and this difference in denial rates 
7
cannot be fully explained by differences in the appli-
8
cants’ credit profiles; 
9
(3) according to data compiled by Attom Data 
10
solutions, small-dollar mortgage originations have 
11
decreased 38 percent since 2009, while there has 
12
been a 65-percent increase in origination of mort-
13
gages for more than $150,000; 
14
(4) the FHA’s mission is to serve creditworthy 
15
borrowers who are underserved and, according to the 
16
Urban Institute, the FHA serves 24 percent of the 
17
overall market, but only 19 percent of the small-dol-
18
lar mortgage market; and 
19
(5) the causes behind these variations are not 
20
fully understood, but merit study that could assist in 
21
furthering the Department of Housing and Urban 
22
Development’s mission, including meeting the hous-
23
ing needs of borrowers the program is designed to 
24
serve and reducing barriers to homeownership, while

5
ucts to identify any barriers or impediments to supporting,

7
mortgages having an original principal obligation of 
8
$70,000 or less. Not later than the expiration of the 12- 
9
month period beginning on the date of the enactment of 
10
this Act, the Secretary shall submit a report to the Con-
11
gress describing the findings of such review and the ac-
12
tions that the Secretary will take, without adversely affect-
13
ing the solvency of the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund, 
14
to remove such barriers and impediments to providing 
15
mortgage insurance for such mortgages.
