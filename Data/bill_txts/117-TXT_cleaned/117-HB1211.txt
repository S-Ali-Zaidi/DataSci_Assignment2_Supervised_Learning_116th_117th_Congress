•HR 1211 IH
(1) In 2017, the International Olympic Com-
1
mittee (IOC) revised its Host City Contract to re-
2
quire host countries to ‘‘protect and respect human 
3
rights and ensure any violation of human rights is 
4
remedied in a manner consistent with international 
5
agreements, laws, and regulations applicable in the 
6
Host Country and in a manner consistent with all 
7
internationally recognised human rights standards 
8
and principles, including the United Nations Guiding 
9
Principles on Business and Human Rights, applica-
10
ble in the Host Country’’. 
11
(2) The Olympic Charter states the goal of 
12
Olympism is ‘‘to place sport at the service of the 
13
harmonious development of humankind, with a view 
14
to promoting a peaceful society concerned with the 
15
preservation of human dignity’’. 
16
(3) The IOC set up an advisory committee on 
17
human rights in December 2018, and IOC President 
18
Thomas Bach said, ‘‘Promoting humanistic values in 
19
sport has been a core feature of the IOC since its 
20
beginning. Our mission, to put sport at the service 
21
of humanity, goes hand-in-hand with human rights, 
22
which is part of our DNA.’’.

Berkley Center for Long-Term Cybersecurity listed 
1
the ‘‘hacking and release of sensitive athletic data’’ 
2
as one of the four significant categories of 
3
cyberattacks on major sporting events.

(5) According to the State Department’s 2019 
5
Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, the 
6
People’s Republic of China’s Ministry of Public Se-
7
curity employs ‘‘tens of millions of surveillance cam-
8
eras’’ to monitor the general public, as well as ‘‘po-
9
litical dissidents, religious leaders and adherents, Ti-
10
betans, and Uyghurs’’. 
11
(6) The People’s Republic of China (PRC) Gov-
12
ernment’s extensive use of artificial intelligence sur-
13
veillance technology, including facial and voice pat-
14
tern recognition technology, poses grave humani-
15
tarian, privacy, and security concerns. PRC authori-
16
ties have used surveillance technology to monitor, 
17
control, and repress an estimated 1.8 million 
18
Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in the 
19
Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. PRC State 
20
media has confirmed that ‘‘voice, image, position 
21
and behavior recognition technologies’’ will be used 
22
in the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics.
