SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The North Atlantic right whale is critically 
3
endangered, with estimates suggesting fewer than 
4
350 remain, including fewer than 100 breeding fe-
5
males. 
6
(2) Harvesters in the North Atlantic have taken 
7
previous actions to protect whales, including by im-
8
plementing weak links, replacing thousands of miles 
9
of floating ground line with whale-safe sinking line, 
10
and increasing the minimum number of traps per 
11
trawl to remove thousands of miles of vertical buoy 
12
lines. 
13
(3) Seventeen North Atlantic right whale mor-
14
talities were observed in 2017, including many deter-
15
mined to have been caused by vessel strikes and en-
16
tanglements, leading to a declaration of a right 
17
whale Unusual Mortality Event. 
18
(4) The Department of Commerce has issued 
19
regulations revising the Atlantic Large Whale Take 
20
Reduction Plan under section 229.32 of title 50, 
21
Code of Federal Regulations (as in effect on the day 
22
before the date of enactment of this Act) that re-
23
quire lobster and Jonah crab harvesters to make 
24
gear modifications.

(5) Implementing the federally required gear 
1
modifications, including markings, is estimated to 
2
cost the industry tens of millions of dollars per year. 
3
(6) The fishing industry is a vital driver of re-
4
gional economies, supporting our coastal commu-
5
nities and stewarding natural resources.
