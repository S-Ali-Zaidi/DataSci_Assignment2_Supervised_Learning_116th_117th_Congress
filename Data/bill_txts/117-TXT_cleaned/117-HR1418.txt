RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the designation of October 1, 2022, 
as ‘‘National Animal Rescue Day’’ to create awareness 
of the importance of animal adoption, to educate on 
the importance of spaying and neutering animals, and 
to encourage animal adoptions throughout the United 
States. 
Whereas millions of cats and dogs are placed into shelters 
every year and hundreds of thousands of healthy, adopt-
able animals are euthanized;

Whereas there are between 3,000 and 4,000 animal shelters 
throughout the United States in need of medical supplies, 
blankets, towels, cleaning supplies, food, and educational 
materials about owning a pet; 
Whereas increased knowledge and awareness of animal rescue 
programs throughout the United States will significantly 
reduce the number of cats and dogs euthanized and re-
duce the number of animals returned to a shelter who 
have been rescued; 
Whereas loving families welcome pets to their new ‘‘forever 
home’’ every day, but more adoption is needed; 
Whereas lowering the number of animals in need of rescue, 
by spaying and neutering, can help alleviate the over-
crowding of the Nation’s shelters; 
Whereas supporting families’ access to housing and veteri-
nary care can further reduce the number of pets surren-
dered or abandoned; 
Whereas years of animal abandonment has left thousands of 
homeless pets in overpopulated shelters and rescues; 
Whereas Charlie, one of the thousands of beagles rescued 
from a breeding facility this year, now has a bright fu-
ture in the laps of his loving new family; 
Whereas a ‘‘National Animal Rescue Day’’ would encourage 
the adoption of rescue animals into loving homes; and 
Whereas the first Saturday in October would be an appro-
priate day to designate as ‘‘National Animal Rescue 
Day’’ to be celebrated through adoption events, festivals, 
and charitable giving which will increase revenues for 
shelters and pet adoptions: Now, therefore, be it
