SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
7
Congress finds the following: 
8
(1) The COVID–19 pandemic has had a dis-
9
proportionately negative impact on mental health of 
10
educators in the United States, leading to an in-
11
crease in stress and burnout among the education 
12
workforce. 
13
(2) According to the National Education Asso-
14
ciation and the American Federation of Teachers, 
15
rates of stress were higher among teachers than 
16
most other working adults during the pandemic. 
17
More than 3 in 4 teachers reported frequent job-re-
18
lated stress, compared to 40-percent of other work-
19
ing adults, and 27-percent of teachers reported 
20
symptoms of depression, compared to 10-percent of 
21
other adults. 
22
(3) The COVID–19 pandemic exacerbated edu-
23
cator departure and retirement, which has led to an

•HR 9475 IH
ongoing teacher recruitment, retention, and shortage 
1
crisis in the United States. 
2
(4) The COVID–19 pandemic highlighted an 
3
increased need for employee health and wellness pro-
4
grams in schools across the country. 
5
(5) Employee wellness programs can help create 
6
a more supportive work environment for education 
7
professionals, thereby supporting educator retention. 
8
(6) More research is essential to understanding 
9
the impact the COVID–19 pandemic had on edu-
10
cators’ mental health, and there is an immediate 
11
need to increase educators’ access to employee 
12
wellness programs.
