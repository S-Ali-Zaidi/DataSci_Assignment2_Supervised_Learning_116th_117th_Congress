SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Unmanned aircraft systems have the poten-
3
tial to change and transform sectors of the United 
4
States economy. 
5
(2) Current uses and applications of unmanned 
6
aircraft systems include agriculture, law enforce-
7
ment, public safety, disaster evaluation and re-
8
sponse, fire detection, border security, weather fore-
9
casting, construction, utility monitoring, and many 
10
other uses and applications. 
11
(3) Research, development, demonstration, test-
12
ing, and evaluation of counter-UAS systems activi-
13
ties are critical to fully understand the capabilities 
14
of and threats posed by unmanned aircraft systems. 
15
(4) Unmanned aircraft systems are subject to 
16
safety, privacy, cybersecurity, and supply chain 
17
risks, particularly as most unmanned aircraft sys-
18
tems in the United States are manufactured or as-
19
sembled from parts manufactured in foreign coun-
20
tries. 
21
21:53 Dec 23, 2022
H9376

•HR 9376 IH
(5) National and homeland security threats 
1
posed by unmanned aircraft systems include crimi-
2
nal and terrorist use for espionage, surveillance, and 
3
intelligence gathering, smuggling drugs and contra-
4
band, and platforms to deliver explosives or chemi-
5
cals, biological, radiological or nuclear weapons, and 
6
other firearms. 
7
(6) The Federal Government has an important 
8
role in advancing research, development, voluntary 
9
consensus standards, and education activities in un-
10
manned aircraft systems and counter-UAS systems 
11
technologies through coordination and collaboration 
12
between State, local, Federal, and Tribal govern-
13
ments, academia, and the private sector. 
14
(7) There is a lack of voluntary consensus 
15
standards for unmanned aircraft systems for aca-
16
demia and the public and private sectors. 
17
(8) The United States needs to invest in domes-
18
tic manufacturing and secure supply chains of un-
19
manned aircraft systems to meet the demand by the 
20
Government and the commercial sectors, to reduce 
21
reliance on foreign-made systems. 
22
(9) Advanced air mobility aims to transform the 
23
way people and goods are transported through new 
24
capabilities and applications.
