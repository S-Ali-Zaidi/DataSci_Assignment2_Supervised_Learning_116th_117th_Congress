(1) While United States-origin americium–241 
1
(Am–241) sealed sources recovered by the National 
2
Nuclear Security Administration of the Department 
3
of Energy may be disposed of at the Waste Isolation 
4
Pilot Plant (WIPP), Russian-origin Am-241 sources 
5
may not be. 
6
(2) Section 2(19) of the WIPP Land With-
7
drawal Act of 1991 identifies WIPP as the location 
8
for the disposal of ‘‘radioactive waste materials gen-
9
erated by atomic energy defense activities’’. 
10
(3) The Am–241 sources of concern that may 
11
not currently be eligible for disposal at WIPP have 
12
the same isotopic properties and are often colocated 
13
with sources that are eligible for disposal at WIPP. 
14
(4) Russian-origin sealed sources, once con-
15
firmed to meet the WIPP Waste Acceptance Cri-
16
teria, should be eligible for disposal at WIPP. 
17
(5) The Carlsbad Field Office of the Depart-
18
ment estimates the volume to be disposed is equiva-
19
lent to 1 to 2 shipments a year and will have a neg-
20
ligible impact on WIPP operations. 
21
(6) The Department, the Nuclear Regulatory 
22
Commission (NRC), and the international commu-
23
nity have identified Am–241 as a radioisotope that

should be protected due to the possibility of its use 
1
in a radiological dispersal device. 
2
(7) As part of its defense nuclear nonprolifera-
3
tion mission, the National Nuclear Security Admin-
4
istration recovers thousands of disused sealed 
5
sources from domestic and international facilities. 
6
(8) Codifying a disposition pathway for these 
7
Am–241 sources will allow the National Nuclear Se-
8
curity Administration to accelerate their removal 
9
and reduce the availability of material that could be 
10
used in a dirty bomb.

(b) CLARIFICATION.—Section 3132(c)(1) of the Ron-
12
ald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for 
13
Fiscal Year 2005 (50 U.S.C. 2569(c)(1)) is amended by 
14
adding at the end the following new subparagraph: 
15
‘‘(N)(i) The collection, storage, and safe 
16
disposal of the materials described in clause (ii) 
17
as waste materials generated by atomic energy 
18
defense activities for the purpose of disposal of 
19
such materials at WIPP (as defined in section 
20
2(19) of the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant Land 
21
Withdrawal Act (Public Law 102–579; 106 
22
Stat. 4777)).

‘‘(ii) The materials described in this clause

radiological materials that—
