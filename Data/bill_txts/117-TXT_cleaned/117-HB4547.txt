SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Association health plans allow small busi-
3
nesses to band together on a regional or national 
4
basis and leverage their combined power to obtain 
5
the health benefits they want and need, at a price 
6
they can afford. 
7
(2) Small business owners have experienced av-
8
erage premium decreases of up to 29 percent under 
9
an association health plan. 
10
(3) Association health plans are governed under 
11
the same rules that apply to employer-sponsored in-
12
surance arrangements for large employers utilized by 
13
more than 160,000,000 Americans. 
14
(4) Important consumer protections established 
15
on a bipartisan basis under the Employee Retire-
16
ment and Income Security Act of 1974, the Health 
17
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 
18
1996, and the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Rec-
19
onciliation Act of 1985 apply to association health 
20
plans. 
21
(5) Association health plans comply with re-
22
quirements for large employer health plans under 
23
the Public Health Service Act, as amended by the 
24
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. 
25

•HR 4547 IH
(6) Association health plans cannot limit plan 
1
eligibility on the basis of medical history, health sta-
2
tus, claims experience, or genetic information. 
3
(7) Fully-insured association health plans must 
4
comply with State benefit mandates. 
5
(8) Self-insured association health plans are 
6
subject to State multiple-employer welfare arrange-
7
ment laws. 
8
(9) The Secretary of Labor used its rulemaking 
9
authority to issue a final rule on June 21, 2018, to 
10
expand access to association health plans for Amer-
11
ican small businesses and working families, includ-
12
ing self-employed business owners. 
13
(10) The Secretary of Labor required associa-
14
tion health plans formed under the final rule to com-
15
ply with even stronger nondiscrimination protections 
16
than the nondiscrimination protections under Fed-
17
eral law prior to the final rule. 
18
(11) On March 28, 2019, a Federal district 
19
judge vacated the Secretary of Labor’s final rule, 
20
threatening to disrupt coverage for current enrollees 
21
and restrict the ability of small businesses and work-
22
ing families to band together to obtain affordable 
23
and high-quality plans in the future.

(12) Health care is one of the most important 
1
issues facing American families, and small business 
2
owners and self-employed Americans want secure 
3
and affordable association health plans to provide 
4
comprehensive coverage for themselves and their 
5
families.
