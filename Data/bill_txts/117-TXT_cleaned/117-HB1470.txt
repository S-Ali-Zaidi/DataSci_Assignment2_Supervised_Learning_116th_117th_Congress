SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
The Congress finds as follows: 
2
(1) In 1871, Congress passed the Ku Klux 
3
Klan Act to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment and 
4
combat rampant violations of civil and constitu-
5
tionally secured rights across the Nation, particu-
6
larly those of newly freed slaves and other Black 
7
Americans in the post-Civil War South 
8
(2) Included in the Act was a provision, now 
9
codified at section 1983 of title 42, United States 
10
Code, which provides a cause of action for persons 
11
to file lawsuits against people acting under color of 
12
State law, including State or local officials, who vio-
13
late their Federal legal and constitutionally secured 
14
rights. 
15
(3) Under section 1979 of the Revised Statutes 
16
(42 U.S.C. 1983) a person may be held liable for 
17
acting under color of State or local law, even if they 
18
are not acting in accordance with State law. 
19
(4) Section 1979 has never included a defense 
20
or immunity for government officials who act in 
21
good faith when violating rights, nor has it ever had 
22
a defense or immunity based on whether the right 
23
was ‘‘clearly established’’ at the time of the viola-
24
tion.

•HR 1470 IH
(5) From the law’s beginning in 1871, through 
1
the 1960s, government actors were not afforded 
2
qualified immunity for violating rights. 
3
(6) In 1967, the Supreme Court in Pierson v. 
4
Ray, 386 U.S. 547, suddenly found that government 
5
actors had a good faith defense for making arrests 
6
under unconstitutional statutes based on a common 
7
law defense for the tort of false arrest. 
8
(7) The Court later extended this beyond false 
9
arrests, turning it into a general good faith defense 
10
for government officials. 
11
(8) Finally, in Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 
12
800 (1982), the Court found the subjective search 
13
for good faith in the government actor unnecessary, 
14
and replaced it with an ‘‘objective reasonableness’’ 
15
standard that requires that the right be ‘‘clearly es-
16
tablished’’ at the time of the violation for the de-
17
fendant to be liable. 
18
(9) This doctrine of qualified immunity has se-
19
verely limited the ability of many plaintiffs to re-
20
cover damages under section 1983 when their rights 
21
have been violated by State and local officials. As a 
22
result, the intent of Congress in passing the law has 
23
been frustrated, and Americans’ rights secured by

the Constitution have not been appropriately pro-
1
tected. 
2
SEC. 3. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS. 
3
It is the sense of the Congress that we must correct 
4
the erroneous interpretation of section 1979 of the Revised 
5
Statutes which provides for qualified immunity, and reit-
6
erate the standard found on the face of the statute, which 
7
does not limit liability on the basis of the defendant’s good 
8
faith beliefs or on the basis that the right was not ‘‘clearly 
9
established’’ at the time of the violation. 
10
SEC. 4. REMOVAL OF QUALIFIED IMMUNITY. 
11
Section 1979 of the Revised Statutes (42 U.S.C. 
12
1983) is amended by adding at the end the following: ‘‘In 
13
any suit pending on, or filed after, the effective date of 
14
the Ending Qualified Immunity Act of 2021, it shall not 
15
be a defense or immunity to any action brought under this 
16
section that the defendant was acting in good faith, or 
17
that the defendant believed, reasonably or otherwise, that 
18
his or her conduct was lawful at the time when it was 
19
committed. Nor shall it be a defense or immunity that the 
20
rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitu-
21
tion or Federal laws were not clearly established at the 
22
time of their deprivation by the defendant, or that the 
23
state of the law was otherwise such that the defendant

could not reasonably have been expected to know whether

his or her conduct was lawful.’’.
