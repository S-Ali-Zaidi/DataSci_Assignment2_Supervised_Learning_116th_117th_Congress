•HR 6307 IH
(1) In 2009, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs 
1
announced a plan to end veteran homelessness by 
2
the end of fiscal year 2015. 
3
(2) While the Department of Veterans Affairs 
4
did not reach such goal, the Department continues 
5
to focus on reducing the number of veterans experi-
6
encing homelessness. 
7
(3) As of January 2020, the Department of 
8
Housing and Urban Development estimated there to 
9
be 37,252 homeless veterans. 
10
(4) At the start of January 2020, 21 out of 
11
every 10,000 veterans in the United States were ex-
12
periencing homelessness. 
13
(5) Veterans constitute about six percent of the 
14
population of the United States but eight percent of 
15
the country’s homeless population. 
16
(6) The leading causes of homelessness among 
17
veterans are post-traumatic stress disorder, social 
18
isolation, unemployment, and substance abuse. 
19
(7) Individual transitional housing units im-
20
prove personal safety for veterans and reduce risks 
21
associated with close quarters living in a shelter.
