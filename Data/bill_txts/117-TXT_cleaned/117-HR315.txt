economics and political science, earning doctorates in eco-
nomics from Columbia University and the London School

Whereas Ambedkar was deeply moved by witnessing the dis-
crimination against African Americans and women in the 
United States, which informed his pursuit to guarantee

Whereas Ambedkar contacted W.E.B. Du Bois in the 1940s, 
writing that ‘‘there is so much similarity between the po-
sition of the Untouchables in India and of the position

tion, stigma, and discrimination against Dalits, and was

pervasive segregation against Dalits;

any citizen on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex,

ment in Indian history to have Dalits at the helm of its 
creation, and influenced the inclusion of minority rights 
in postcolonial constitutions around the world; 
Whereas in Ambedkar’s final speech in India’s Constituent 
Assembly on November 25, 1949, Ambedkar advocated 
for the active preservation of democracy, warning: ‘‘If we 
wish to preserve the Constitution in which we have 
sought to enshrine the principle of Government of the 
people, for the people and by the people, let us resolve 
not to be tardy in the recognition of the evils that lie 
across our path and which induce people to prefer Gov-
ernment for the people to Government by the people, nor 
to be weak in our initiative to remove them’’; 
Whereas President Barack Obama invoked Ambedkar’s con-
tribution to the Indian constitution and Indian society in 
an address before the Indian parliament in 2010, affirm-
ing ‘‘We believe that no matter who you are or where you

tial. Just as a Dalit like Dr. Ambedkar could lift himself
