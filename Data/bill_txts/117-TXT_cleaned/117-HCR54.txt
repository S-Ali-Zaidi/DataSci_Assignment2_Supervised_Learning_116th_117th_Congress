CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 
Objecting to the slowdown in mail delivery and postage rate 
increase instituted by Postmaster General Louis DeJoy 
and seeking to halt both actions pending further inves-
tigation. 
Whereas the United States Postal Service deliberately started 
slowing its mail delivery on Friday, October 1, 2021, and 
plans to add rate hikes for mail delivery to the slowdown 
as part of an overt plan by Postmaster General Louis 
DeJoy; 
Whereas the most widespread and significant changes will af-
fect first-class mail delivery, items such as letters, small 
packages, bills, and tax documents;

Whereas prior to the changes by Postmaster General DeJoy, 
customers throughout the United States could expect 
first-class mail to reach its destination in 1 to 3 days; 
now, that timeframe will extend to between 1 and 5 days, 
even though the United States Postal Service is required 
by law to provide ‘‘prompt, reliable, and efficient serv-
ices’’; 
Whereas Postmaster General DeJoy started his tenure in 
June 2020, then implemented operational changes at the 
United States Postal Service soon after by slowing mail 
delivery, reassigning and displacing 23 postal executives, 
and deactivating 10 percent of mail sorting machines to 
create a dayslong mail backlog; 
Whereas, on August 24, 2020, the Committee on Oversight 
and Reform of the House of Representatives held a hear-
ing to hold Postmaster General DeJoy and the United 
States Postal Service Board of Governors accountable for 
a deterioration in mail delivery reliability in anticipation 
of the November 2020 elections; 
Whereas the hard work of the on-the-ground employees at the 
United States Postal Service combined with congressional 
intervention prevented the vote-by-mail components of 
the November 2020 elections from failing; 
Whereas the Committee on Oversight and Reform of the 
House of Representatives continued to hold Postmaster 
General DeJoy accountable after the November 2020 
elections, holding another congressional hearing on Feb-
ruary 24, 2021, that— 
(1) examined legislative proposals to improve mail 
delivery performance standards; and 
(2) led to Postmaster General DeJoy’s public apol-
ogy for slowdowns through the holiday season;

Whereas the United States Postal Service is required by law 
to deliver to any postal address in the United States, no 
matter what; 
Whereas current United States Postal Service slowdowns 
could most affect the elderly, people with disabilities, and 
those in rural areas for whom mail delivery is critical to 
their health care, financial security, and connection to the 
broader world; 
Whereas affordability is a crucial aspect of the United States 
Postal Service, which is currently being undercut by price 
hikes on many first-class mail products according to the 
Postmaster General’s plan; 
Whereas the House of Representatives passed mail-in ballot 
delivery reforms through the For the People Act in 
March 2021, and multiple other measures have been in-
troduced that could help the United States Postal Service 
provide more dependable service for the American people, 
including the United States Postal Service Fairness Act, 
the Vote By Mail Tracking Act, the Nonpartisan Post-
master General Act, the Postal Service Improvement Act, 
the bipartisan Postal Service Reform Act, the DEJOY 
Act, and the Postal Vehicle Modernization Act, as well as 
funding measures through the Build Back Better Act 
that could help electrify the United States Postal Service 
delivery vehicle fleet and modernize other equipment used 
by frontline employees; 
Whereas under Federal statute, the United States Postal 
Service must receive an advisory opinion from the inde-
pendent Postal Regulatory Commission, which serves as 
a regulatory body for the United States Postal Service, 
when it seeks to implement reforms that would affect 
service on a nationwide basis;

Whereas the Postal Regulatory Commission has signaled that 
United States Postal Service slowdowns under the plan 
might not have the intended effect, as the slowdowns are 
based on ‘‘unproven assumptions’’, and that the Postal 
Service would achieve only ‘‘paltry’’ savings from the 
Postmaster General’s plan; and 
Whereas the Postal Regulatory Commission’s advisory opin-
ion does not carry the force of law, however, and even if 
the Commission ruled firmly against Postmaster General 
DeJoy’s plan, the agency could move forward anyway: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate 
1
concurring), That— 
2
(1) Congress objects to the slowdown in mail 
3
delivery instituted by Postmaster General Louis 
4
DeJoy in his plan; and 
5
(2) the decisions to slow down mail and to in-
6
crease postage rates should be halted immediately

pending further investigation and full substantiation 
8
by Postmaster General Louis DeJoy to the Con-
9
gress.
