SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) 28,800,000 individuals in the United Sates, 
3
or 9 percent of the national population, will have an 
4
eating disorder in their lifetime. It is estimated that 
5
1,619,300 to 2,080,600 individuals on Medicare part 
6
B are affected by an eating disorder, including 
7
420,500 to 560,700 beneficiaries who identify as 
8
Black, Indigenous, or People of Color. 
9
(2) 10,200 deaths per year in the United States 
10
occur as a direct result of an eating disorder, equat-
11
ing to 1 death every 52 minutes. Eating disorders 
12
have one of the highest mortality rates of all mental 
13
illness due to serious medical comorbidities such as 
14
stroke, diabetes, and gastric rupture, in addition to 
15
the fact that longitudinal studies have found that 
16
the suicide risk for those with an eating disorder is 
17
23 times the expected risk. 
18
(3) Eating disorders can be successfully treated 
19
with care encompassing the 4 pillars of successful 
20
treatment: medical, psychiatric, therapy, and medical 
21
nutrition therapy. In general, Medicare provides 
22
some, but not all, care necessary for eating disorders 
23
treatment. It doesn’t cover medical nutrition therapy 
24
at the outpatient level and provides no coverage at

the intensive outpatient or residential treatment lev-
1
els. 
2
(4) Eating disorders are expensive. The yearly 
3
economic 
cost 
of 
eating 
disorders 
is 
4
$64,700,000,000, with families and individuals expe-
5
riencing an economic loss of $23,500,000,000 per 
6
year. Each year, eating disorders are directly re-
7
sponsible for 23,560 inpatient hospitalizations cost-
8
ing $209,700,000 and 53,918 emergency room visits 
9
costing $29,300,000. 
10
(5) Eating disorders in the elderly are particu-
11
larly serious because chronic disorders or diseases 
12
may already compromise a patient’s health and 
13
make a patient more prone to serious comorbidities 
14
associated with eating disorders, including cardiac, 
15
metabolic, gastric, and bone conditions. Early diag-
16
nosis and proper treatment of this population is es-
17
sential.
