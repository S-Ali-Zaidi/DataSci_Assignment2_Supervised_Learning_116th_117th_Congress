RESOLUTION 
Reaffirming the importance of upholding democracy, human 
rights, and the rule of law in United States foreign policy. 
Whereas strong democracies make strong partners for the 
United States in fostering the peace and prosperity that 
our citizens desire; 
Whereas democratic principles and values have come under 
increasing strain around the world as governments back-
slide on their commitments to govern justly, trans-
parently, and with respect for the rights of their citizens; 
Whereas support for democracy, human rights, and the rule 
of law is consistent with our national character and 
founding values; 
Whereas the promotion, protection, and advancement of de-
mocracy, human rights, and the rule of law around the

world have been core, bipartisan components of United 
States foreign policy essential to the achievement of other 
United States foreign policy goals, including reducing 
poverty and racial inequality, promoting peaceful resolu-
tion of conflict, strengthening global alliances, ensuring 
gender equality, expanding prosperity, fostering greater 
security for all people, and sustaining the global environ-
ment; 
Whereas the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 states that ‘‘a 
principal goal of the foreign policy of the United States 
is to promote the increased observance of internationally 
recognized human rights by all countries’’; 
Whereas the United States, as a signatory of the Helsinki 
Final Act, has joined other like-minded countries in af-
firming its commitment to respecting ‘‘human rights and 
fundamental freedoms, including the freedom of thought, 
conscience, religion or belief, for all without distinction as 
to race, sex, language or religion.’’; 
Whereas this commitment includes respecting the rights of 
‘‘minorities to equality before the law . . . [and] the full 
opportunity for the actual enjoyment of human rights 
and fundamental freedoms’’; 
Whereas it is longstanding United States policy to work 
alongside like-minded democratic governments, legisla-
tures, civil society leaders and organizations, academic in-
stitutions and scholars, independent media and journal-
ists, anti-corruption activists, and international organiza-
tions worldwide to promote, protect, and advance the 
cause of democracy, human rights, and the rule of law; 
Whereas civil society organizations, human rights defenders, 
and journalists play a critical role in promoting human

rights, transparency, accountability, and good govern-
ance, and around the world often face smear campaigns, 
criminalization, or other governmental constraints on 
their work, including intimidation, death threats, arbi-
trary detention, physical attacks, sexual violence, en-
forced disappearances, and murder; 
Whereas racism, anti-Semitism, and other forms of ethnic 
and religious discrimination threaten the rights, safety, 
and prosperity of individuals around the world; 
Whereas support for democracy around the world enhances 
regional peace and stability, opens doors for economic op-
portunity, and provides a counterweight to violent and 
radical extremism—all of which are in the national secu-
rity interests of the United States and its allies; 
Whereas democratic systems of government enshrine the indi-
vidual human rights of all citizens, so that every indi-
vidual can contribute to and enjoy the benefits of peace-
ful, prosperous societies; 
Whereas the United States supports the existence of and has 
often worked in partnership with independent and multi-
lateral human rights organizations, both at local and 
international levels, and has used their reporting for pol-
icy development and referred to their findings in the an-
nual Department of State Country Reports on Human 
Rights Practices and other United States policy docu-
ments; 
Whereas the idea of America enshrined in our democratic 
principles is one of our greatest competitive strengths, 
such that when we abandon these values and adopt the 
flawed principles and tactics of our adversaries, we be-

come weaker as a country and undermine our standing 
around the world; 
Whereas some countries are actively promoting an authori-
tarian model of government as an alternative to the 
model long advanced by the United States based on de-
mocracy, human rights, and the rule of law, with the au-
thoritarian model representing a threat to the role and 
influence of the United States in the world; 
Whereas some countries hostile to the democratic principles 
and values the United States has long promoted are also 
working to erode international alliances and organizations 
dedicated to advancing those principles, thereby placing 
United States security and economic interests at risk; 
and 
Whereas the United States has historically allied most closely 
and productively with those countries committed to de-
mocracy, human rights, and the rule of law: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
