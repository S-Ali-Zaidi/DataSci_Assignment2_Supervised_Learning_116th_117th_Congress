A BILL 
To direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to 
evaluate the extent to which the substitution of inter-
changeable biological products may be impeded by dif-
ferences between the system for determining a biological 
product to be interchangeable and the system for assign-
ing therapeutic equivalence ratings to drugs, and for 
other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

(1) complete a study to evaluate the extent to 
10
which the substitution of interchangeable biological 
11
products licensed under section 351 of the Public 
12
Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262) may be impeded 
13
by differences between the system for determining a 
14
biological product to be interchangeable under sec-
15
tion 351(k)(4) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 262(k)(4))

proach for communicating the substitutability of

interchangeable biological products with the ap-

proach for communicating therapeutic equivalence
