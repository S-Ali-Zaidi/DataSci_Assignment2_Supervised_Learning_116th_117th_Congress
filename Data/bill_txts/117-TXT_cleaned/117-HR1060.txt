RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the designation of April 14, 2022, 
as ‘‘Remanufacturing Day’’. 
Whereas remanufacturing is a comprehensive and rigorous 
industrial process by which a previously sold, leased, 
used, worn, remanufactured, or nonfunctional product or 
part is returned to a like-new, same-as-when-new, or bet-
ter-than-when-new condition, from both a quality and 
performance perspective, through a controlled, reproduc-
ible, and sustainable process; 
Whereas a 2012 United States International Trade Commis-
sion (ITC) report found that remanufacturers support at 
least 180,000 full-time jobs in the United States, and the 
ITC report states that production of remanufactured 
goods in the United States increased by 15 percent from 
2009 to 2011 and exports totaled $11.2 billion annually;

•HRES 1060 IH 
Whereas remanufacturing has been recognized by leading 
universities, research institutions, and manufacturers in 
the United States as good for the environment for its 
ability to divert end-of-life products from landfills; 
Whereas, by encouraging businesses, State agencies, non-
profit organizations, schools, and individuals to celebrate 
‘‘Remanufacturing Day’’ in 2022, we can further pro-
mote remanufacturing as environmentally friendly and 
economically smart; and 
Whereas, to focus the Nation’s attention on the benefits of 
remanufacturing, businesses, educational institutions, 
and nonprofit organizations have joined together to cele-
brate ‘‘Remanufacturing Day’’ and are encouraging their 
colleagues, friends and families, and their communities to 
learn more about the benefits of remanufactured prod-
ucts: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives supports 
1
the designation of ‘‘Remanufacturing Day’’.
