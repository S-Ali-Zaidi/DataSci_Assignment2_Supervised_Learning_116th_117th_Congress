1
matic stress disorder.

5
jected to sexual misconduct by school personnel.

16
1972 (20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.), which prohibits sex 
17
discrimination in education programs or activities

receiving federal funds, requires elementary and sec-
19
ondary schools to protect students from sexual abuse 
20
and misconduct. 
21

22
viduals serving our communities and they make in-
23
