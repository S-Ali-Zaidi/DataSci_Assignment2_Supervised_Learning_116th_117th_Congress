RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the goals of November National Lung 
Cancer Awareness Month and for the early detection 
and treatment of lung cancer. 
Whereas lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related 
death among individuals in the United States, accounting 
for more deaths than colon cancer, breast cancer, and 
prostate cancer combined; 
Whereas it is estimated that, in 2022, 236,740 individuals in 
the United States will be diagnosed with lung cancer, and 
130,180 individuals (approximately 350 individuals per 
day) will die from the disease; 
Whereas 1 in 16 men and 1 in 17 women in the United 
States will develop lung cancer during their lifetimes;

Whereas the rate of lung cancer diagnosis in women in the 
United States has increased by 79 percent over the past 
44 years, each year more women die from lung cancer 
than breast cancer, and, by 2035, it is estimated that 
more women will die from lung cancer than men; 
Whereas disparities in lung cancer screening, diagnosis, treat-
ment, and mortality are well-documented, and Black men 
have the highest incidence of lung cancer and the highest 
mortality rate from lung cancer of any racial or ethnic 
group in the United States; 
Whereas, in 2022, lung cancer in individuals who have never 
smoked is estimated to account for 20,700 deaths in the 
United States, according to the American Cancer Society; 
Whereas women who have never smoked are more likely to 
be diagnosed with lung cancer than men who have never 
smoked; 
Whereas, in the United States, the proportion of lung cancers 
diagnosed in individuals who have never smoked is in-
creasing; 
Whereas the 5-year survival rate for localized lung cancer is 
61 percent, yet only 19 percent of lung cancers are diag-
nosed at this stage, while a majority of lung cancer cases 
are diagnosed at the distant stage, for which the 5-year 
survival rate is 7 percent; 
Whereas screening individuals at high risk of lung cancer 
using low-dose computed tomography can detect lung 
cancer earlier than other forms of screening and ulti-
mately save lives; 
Whereas over 1,000,000 veterans are eligible for lung cancer 
screening, but less than 3 percent undergo lung cancer 
screening by low-dose computed tomography;

•HRES 1500 IH 
Whereas lung cancer screening can effectively reduce lung 
cancer mortality, but, annually, only 4.5 percent of indi-
viduals in the United States at risk for lung cancer un-
dergo lung cancer screening with low-dose computed to-
mography; 
Whereas current lung cancer screening guidelines help iden-
tify cancer early for individuals at high risk of lung can-
cer, leading to a higher likelihood of successful treatment, 
but can preclude screening for individuals who develop 
lung cancer, including individuals who have never smoked 
but have other risk factors, such as family history of lung 
cancer, exposure to secondhand smoke, or exposure to 
radon, which is the second-leading cause of lung cancer; 
and 
Whereas educational efforts can increase awareness of lung 
cancer and lung cancer screening among the general pub-
lic, patients and their families, and health care workers, 
thereby increasing the early detection of lung cancer: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the purposes and ideals of Na-
2
tional Lung Cancer Awareness Month; 
3
(2) promotes efforts to increase awareness of, 
4
and education about, lung cancer among individuals 
5
in the United States; 
6
(3) champions efforts to increase lung cancer 
7
screening by raising awareness among, and improv-
8
ing access for, individuals who are eligible for lung 
9
cancer screening;
