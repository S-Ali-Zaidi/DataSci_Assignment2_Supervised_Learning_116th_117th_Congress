A BILL 
To provide incentives for States to eliminate statutes of 
limitation related to child sexual abuse, and for other 
purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘No Time Limit for 
4
Justice Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) According to the Children’s Bureau of the 
8
Administration on Children, Youth and Families of 
9
the Department of Health and Human Services,

•HR 5049 IH
every 9 minutes, a child is sexually assaulted in the 
1
United States, and 93 percent of victims know the 
2
perpetrator, who is often related to the victim. 
3
(2) Child sexual abuse can have a serious im-
4
pact on the physical and mental health of victims, 
5
who often experience post-traumatic stress disorder, 
6
shame, guilt, anxiety, and depression. 
7
(3) A study from the National Institutes of 
8
Health found that between 60 and 80 percent of vic-
9
tims of childhood sexual abuse wait until adulthood 
10
to disclose their abuse. 
11
(4) Due to the especially heinous nature of 
12
child sexual abuse, it is imperative that perpetrators 
13
of this crime are punished and prevented from re-
14
offending, and that victims have the opportunity to 
15
see their abusers brought to justice. 
16
(5) Statutes of limitations for felony sex crimes 
17
against minors differ by State, and some end as lit-
18
tle as 3 years after the crime occurred, even for 
19
crimes like production of child sexual abuse imagery. 
20
For victims, statutes of limitations can hinder their 
21
ability to seek justice and hold their perpetrator ac-
22
countable.
