RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the United States should not waive intellectual property 
rights relating to COVID–19 vaccines or treatments. 
Whereas building on decades of research and in conjunction 
with Operation Warp Speed, the United States pharma-
ceutical industry successfully developed three incredibly 
effective COVID–19 vaccines to date, with a fourth vac-
cine currently undergoing clinical trials; 
Whereas these vaccines are the most respected, most sought 
after vaccines in the world due to their exceptional effi-
cacy and safety, which is due to both the painstaking

work and investment during development as well as the 
diligent efforts of the United States pharmaceutical in-
dustry to qualify and oversee world-class manufacturing 
facilities to produce the vaccines; 
Whereas intellectual property protections are vital to 
incentivize innovation, including the innovations that di-
rectly led to the COVID–19 vaccines and may revolu-
tionize future vaccine development efforts; and 
Whereas intellectual property protections have not contrib-
uted significantly to shortages of COVID–19 vaccines or 
had a significant effect on the pace of vaccinations, both 
of which are predominantly dependent on logistical chal-
lenges, raw material shortages, and other factors: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, that it is the sense of the House of Rep-
