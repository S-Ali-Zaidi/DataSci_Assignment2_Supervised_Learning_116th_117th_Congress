SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds that— 
5
(1) recreational fishing and hunting and other 
6
forms of outdoor recreation are important and tradi-
7
tional activities in which millions of people in the 
8
United States participate; 
9
(2) a lack of information about publicly avail-
10
able outdoor recreation opportunities depresses par-
11
ticipation in those traditional activities; 
12
(3) it is in the public interest to provide en-
13
hanced and expanded information about access to 
14
Federal land for recreational opportunities; 
15
(4) modern Global Positioning System tech-
16
nologies can provide detailed and real-time informa-
17
tion to the public about access to, and recreation op-
18
portunities on, Federal land; 
19
(5) many of the access easement records held 
20
by Federal land management agencies are held on 
21
paper files and cannot be easily integrated into dig-
22
ital mapping systems; and 
23
(6) 
Federal 
land 
management 
agencies 
24
should—
