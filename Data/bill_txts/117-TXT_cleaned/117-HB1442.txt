Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Providing Responsible 
4
Emergency Plans for Animals at Risk of Emerging Disas-
5
ters Act’’ or the ‘‘PREPARED Act’’. 
6
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
7
Congress makes the following findings: 
8
(1) Recent natural and man-made disasters 
9
have highlighted the need for planning to minimize 
10
the impact of disasters. 
11
(2) Lack of preparedness in times of disaster 
12
can have especially devastating effects on animals 
13
and the people who risk their lives to protect them. 
14
(3) Local first-responders, nongovernmental 
15
agencies, and private individuals most often shoulder 
16
the cost and responsibility of animals affected by 
17
disasters. 
18
(4) It is reasonable to ask those who use ani-
19
mals commercially to demonstrate a level of readi-
20
ness to protect the animals under their care.
