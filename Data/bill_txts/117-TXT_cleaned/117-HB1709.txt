SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Americans from across the country served 
3
in defense of democracy and freedom during World 
4
War II (WWII) by volunteering for service with the 
5
Canadian and British militaries and other associated 
6
organizations that were fighting Nazi and Fascist 
7
aggression. Many United States citizens perceived 
8
the importance of this war and the severe impact 
9
Nazism and Fascism could have on the American 
10
way of life. Therefore, prior to the United States 
11
entry into the conflict and indeed throughout WWII 
12
these patriots independently crossed the border into 
13
Canada and entered Canadian and British armed 
14
forces recruiting offices or sought out representa-
15
tives based in major United States municipalities 
16
and elsewhere. 
17
(2) When the ‘‘United Kingdom of Great Brit-
18
ain and Northern Ireland’’ and the ‘‘British Com-
19
monwealth of Nations’’ were drawn into WWII after 
20
Germany invaded Poland in 1939, the Canadian and 
21
British air forces made a concerted effort to recruit 
22
Americans. 
23
(3) It is documented that thousands of Ameri-
24
cans joined the Canadian and British armed forces, 
25
a large percentage joining the Royal Canadian Air

Force (RCAF) alone. In a 1942 film Air Marshal 
1
William Avery ‘‘Billy’’ Bishop, an organizer and pro-
2
moter of the British Commonwealth Air Training 
3
Plan (BCATP) and Director of the Royal Canadian 
4
Air Force, recognized the ‘‘gallant lads from the 
5
United States who have come up here to help and 
6
serve with us’’. Notably, many Americans were also 
7
recruited and processed through Canada before 
8
being assigned to or detached for the purpose of 
9
Royal Air Force (RAF) service. 
10
(4) General of the Army, Army of the United 
11
States, Dwight D. Eisenhower, the former Supreme 
12
Allied Commander of the Allied Expeditionary 
13
Force, referenced, in a speech on January 10, 1946, 
14
the ‘‘some twelve thousand American citizens’’ who 
15
crossed into Canada with the goal of entering the 
16
Canadian armed forces. Although the precise num-
17
bers of Americans who were in Canadian and British 
18
service are unknown, media accounts published by 
19
Allied journalists during the conflict nonetheless de-
20
tail their legacies of volunteerism, personal sacrifice, 
21
and bravery. 
22
(5) Americans also joined the Canadian Avia-
23
tion Bureau, and the Home Guard, Air Transport 
24
Auxiliary (ATA), and Royal Air Force Ferry Com-

mand/Transport Command in Britain. The existence 
1
of these ancillaries enabled patriotic citizens, who 
2
were, at least initially, unable to join a branch of the 
3
United States military due to gender, age, race, 
4
health, the lack of sufficient college education, or 
5
other reasons, to support the war effort. Those who 
6
contributed via these alternative concerns were no 
7
less essential to attaining victory. 
8
(6) The infusion of Americans into Canada 
9
helped to reduce shortages of civilian and military 
10
pilots in the BCATP, and President Franklin Roo-
11
sevelt paid tribute to both Canada and the program 
12
in a wartime letter to Canadian Prime Minister Wil-
13
liam Lyon Mackenzie King. Within the correspond-
14
ence President Roosevelt used the phrase ‘‘the Aero-
15
drome of Democracy’’. 
16
(7) As members of the Canadian and British 
17
militaries, the American volunteers served in many 
18
capacities. Extant military rolls and individual serv-
19
ice records document, and thereby testify to, their 
20
contributions. 
21
(8) A sizable number of Americans lost their 
22
lives or were wounded while serving in the RCAF 
23
and RAF. The Canadian Army, British Army, Royal 
24
Canadian Navy, and Royal Navy also incurred 
25
04:29 May 01, 2021

•HR 1709 IH
American personnel casualties. Those who perished 
1
and the survivors demonstrated the exceptional cour-
2
age that has been repeatedly displayed in the de-
3
fense of freedom throughout American history. 
4
(9) A unique and highly publicized group of 
5
Americans, who were members of the RCAF and 
6
RAF, were posted to the famous RAF Eagle Squad-
7
rons and thereby showcased the important roles 
8
American volunteers were undertaking. British 
9
Prime Minister Winston Churchill, whose mother 
10
was American, played an important role in originally 
11
promoting the concept of the Eagle Squadrons to 
12
the Air Ministry. 
13
(10) The early successes of female ferry air-
14
crews paved the way for the formation in the United 
15
States of the Women Airforce Service Pilots 
16
(WASP) in 1943. The exceptional legacy of the 
17
Women Airforce Service Pilots, ATA, etc., provided 
18
essential support and paved the way for future gen-
19
erations of military women. 
20
(11) A substantial portion of the Americans 
21
serving in Canadian and British aerial forces trans-
22
ferred to the United States Army Air Forces be-
23
tween 1942 and 1944, while others elected to enter 
24
other branches of the United States Military.

(12) The practical experience these veterans of 
1
Canadian and British service possessed provided the 
2
inexperienced American Forces with an immediate 
3
degree of competence and effectiveness. More than a 
4
few became accomplished combat pilots, the Amer-
5
ican Fighter Aces Association possessing many of 
6
them within the organization’s core membership. 
7
(13) The bravery and foresight displayed by the 
8
Americans who enlisted in the Canadian and British 
9
armed forces represent a largely unrecognized story 
10
of valor, and their initiatives are worthy of official 
11
recognition. 
12
(14) The United States Nationals who volun-
13
teered for service with military-associated Canadian 
14
and British ancillary entities are to be equally recog-
15
nized for their volunteerism, contributions, and sac-
16
rifices.
