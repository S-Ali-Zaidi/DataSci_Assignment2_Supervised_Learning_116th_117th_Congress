Whereas data shows that in the past 2 years, fentanyl poi-
soning deaths have doubled as a whole in the United 
States, and deaths have more than doubled in 30 States; 
Whereas illicit fentanyl is being mass-produced in China and 
shipped overseas to markets in Mexico, Canada, and the 
United States; 
Whereas, in 2021, U.S. Customs and Border Protections 
seized 588 pounds of illicit fentanyl which has increased

Whereas, in 2021, the Drug Enforcement Administration 
confiscated 20,400,000 fake prescription pills containing 
fentanyl, mainly produced by Mexico, using chemicals 
sourced largely from China; 
Whereas this amount of fentanyl seized is enough to provide 
a lethal dose to every single American; 
Whereas 1 kilogram of fentanyl has the ability to kill 500,000 
people; 
Whereas approximately 666,666 counterfeit pills can be man-
ufactured from 1 kilogram of pure fentanyl; 
Whereas carfentanil is a derivative of fentanyl and is approxi-
mately 10,000 times more potent than morphine and 20 
to 30 times that of fentanyl; 
Whereas carfentanil was used as a chemical weapon in the 
Moscow theater hostage crisis to kill 150 Russians in 
2002; 
Whereas a 2022 report issued by the United States Commis-

number of people through the release, dissemination, or 
impact of—

sors; 
‘‘(2) a disease organism; or 
‘‘(3) radiation or radioactivity.’’: Now, therefore be
