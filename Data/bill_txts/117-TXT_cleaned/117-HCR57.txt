CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 
Celebrating the first anniversary of the coalition of signatory 
countries to the Geneva Consensus Declaration on Pro-
moting Women’s Health and Strengthening the Family. 
Whereas the United States strongly supports women reaching 
the highest attainable outcomes for health, life, dignity, 
and well-being throughout their lives; 
Whereas the historic coalition that issued the Geneva Con-
sensus Declaration on Promoting Women’s Health and 
Strengthening the Family (in this preamble referred to as

•HCON 57 IH 
the ‘‘Geneva Consensus Declaration’’) was formed by a 
diverse group of countries committed to charting a more 
positive path to advance the health of women, protect the 
family as foundational to any healthy society, affirm the 
value of life in all stages of development, and uphold the 
sovereign right of countries to make their own laws to 
advance those core values, without external pressure; 
Whereas the Geneva Consensus Declaration was signed on 
October 22, 2020, by 32 countries from every region of 
the world, representing more than 1,600,000,000 people, 
which committed to working together on the core pillars 
enshrined in the Declaration, and 5 countries have subse-
quently signed; 
Whereas, although President Joseph R. Biden removed the 
United States as a signatory to the Geneva Consensus 
Declaration, at least temporarily, 36 countries remain 
signatories, and longstanding Federal laws that prohibit 
the United States from conducting or funding abortions, 
abortion lobbying, or coercive family planning in foreign 
countries remain in effect; 
Whereas the Geneva Consensus Declaration reaffirms that 
‘‘all are equal before the law’’ and ‘‘human rights of 
women are an inalienable, integral, and indivisible part of 
all human rights and fundamental freedoms’’; 
Whereas the Geneva Consensus Declaration reaffirms the in-
herent ‘‘dignity and worth of the human person’’ and 
that ‘‘every human being has the inherent right to life’’; 
Whereas the Geneva Consensus Declaration reaffirms that 
‘‘there is no international right to abortion, nor any 
international obligation on the part of States to finance 
or facilitate abortion’’;
