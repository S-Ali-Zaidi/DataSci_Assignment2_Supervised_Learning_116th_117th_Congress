1
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) In the United States and around the world, 
3
digital platforms and online services play a central 
4
role in modern life by providing new tools for com-
5
munication, commerce, entrepreneurship, and de-
6
bate. 
7
(2) The United States takes pride in the suc-
8
cess of its technology sector, which leads the world 
9
in innovation and dynamism, provides valuable serv-
10
ices to the people of the United States, and supports 
11
thousands of good-paying jobs in the United States. 
12
(3) In recent years, a few digital platforms have 
13
benefitted from the combination of economies of 
14
scale, network effects, and unique characteristics of 
15
the digital marketplace to achieve vast power over 
16
the economy, society, and democracy of the United 
17
States.

(4) The last time Congress enacted legislation 
1
to meaningfully regulate the technology or tele-
2
communications sector was the Telecommunications 
3
Act of 1996 (Public Law 104–104; 110 Stat 56.), 
4
years before many of today’s largest digital plat-
5
forms even existed. 
6
(5) Digital platforms remain largely unregu-
7
lated and are left to write their own rules without 
8
meaningful democratic input or accountability. 
9
(6) The unregulated policies and operations of 
10
some of the most powerful digital platforms have at 
11
times produced demonstrable harm, including— 
12
(A) undercutting small businesses; 
13
(B) abetting the collapse of trusted local 
14
journalism; 
15
(C) enabling addiction and other harms to 
16
the mental health of the people of the United 
17
States, especially minors; 
18
(D) disseminating disinformation and hate 
19
speech; 
20
(E) undermining privacy and monetizing 
21
the personal data of individuals in the United 
22
States without their informed consent; and 
23
(F) in some cases, radicalizing individuals 
24
to violence.

•HR 7858 IH
(7) The failure of the United States Govern-
1
ment to establish appropriate regulations for digital 
2
platforms cedes to foreign competitors the historic 
3
role played by the United States in setting reason-
4
able rules of the road and technical standards for 
5
emerging technologies. 
6
(8) Throughout the history of the United 
7
States, Congress has often responded to the emer-
8
gence of powerful and complex new sectors of the 
9
economy by empowering sector-specific expert Fed-
10
eral regulators. 
11
(9) Throughout the history of the United 
12
States, the Federal Government has established rea-
13
sonable regulation, consistent with the First Amend-
14
ment to the Constitution of the United States, to 
15
promote a diversity of viewpoints, support civic en-
16
gagement, and preserve the right of citizens to com-
17
municate with each other, which is foundational to 
18
self-governance. 
19
(10) The unique power and complexity of sev-
20
eral digital platforms, combined with the absence of 
21
modern Federal regulations, reinforces the need for 
22
a new Federal body equipped with the authorities, 
23
tools, and expertise to regulate digital platforms to 
24

ensure their operations remain consistent, where ap-
1
propriate, with the public interest. 
2
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
3
gress that the Federal agency established under this Act 
4
should— 
5
(1) develop appropriate regulations and policies 
6
grounded in the common law principles of the duty 
7
of care and the duty to deal, insofar as those prin-
8
ciples are relevant and practical; and 
9
(2) adopt, where relevant and practical, a risk 
10
management regulatory approach that prioritizes an-
11
ticipating, limiting, and balancing against other in-
12
terests the broad economic, societal, and political 
13
risks of harm posed by the activities and operations 
14
of a person or class of persons.
