(b) FINDINGS RELATING TO CONGRESSIONAL ELEC-
1
TION OBSERVERS.—Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The Constitution delegates to each House of 
3
Congress the authority to ‘‘be the Judge of the Elec-
4
tions, Returns and Qualifications of its own Mem-
5
bers’’. 
6
(2) While, in general, Congress shall respect the 
7
determination of State authorities with respect to 
8
the election of members to each House, each House 
9
of Congress serves as the final arbiter over any con-
10
test to the seating of any putative Member-elect or 
11
Senator-elect. 
12
(3) These election contest procedures are con-
13
tained in the precedents of each House of Congress. 
14
Further, for the House of Representatives the proce-
15
dures exist under the Federal Contested Elections 
16
Act. 
17
(4) In the post-Civil War modern era, more 
18
than 100 election contests have been filed with the 
19
House of Representatives. 
20
(5) For decades, Congress has appointed and 
21
sent out official congressional observers to watch the 
22
administration of congressional elections in the 
23
States and territories.

(6) These observers serve to permit Congress to 
1
develop its own factual record in preparation for 
2
eventual contests and for other reasons.

(7) This Act and the amendments made by this 
4
Act do not establish any new authorities or proce-
5
dures but are provided simply to permit a convenient 
6
statutory reference for existing congressional author-
7
ity and activity.
