Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Modern, Clean, and 
4
Safe Trucks Act of 2022’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds that— 
7
(1) the 12-percent Federal retail excise tax on 
8
certain new heavy trucks, tractors, and trailers, cou-
9
pled with new regulatory mandates, significantly in-
10

•HR 8116 IH
creases the cost of new heavy-duty trucks, tractors, 
1
and trailers and discourages the replacement of 
2
older, less environmentally clean and less fuel eco-
3
nomical vehicles; 
4
(2) this 12-percent Federal retail excise tax is 
5
the highest percentage rate of any Federal ad valo-
6
rem excise tax; 
7
(3) the Federal excise tax was first levied by 
8
Congress in 1917 to help finance America’s involve-
9
ment in World War I; 
10
(4) the 12-percent Federal retail excise tax rou-
11
tinely adds between $12,000 and $22,000 to the cost 
12
of a new heavy truck, tractor, or trailer; 
13
(5) more than half of the Class 8 trucks on the 
14
road are over 10 years old and lack a decade of envi-
15
ronmental and safety technological advancements; 
16
(6) since 2007, new trucks have reduced carbon 
17
dioxide emissions by 202 million tons, nitrogen oxide 
18
emissions by 27 million tons, and saved 20 billion 
19
gallons of diesel and 472 million barrels of crude oil; 
20
(7) an owner of a single Class 8 truck powered 
21
by the latest clean diesel engine can expect to save 
22
about 2,200 gallons of fuel each year compared to 
23
previous generations of technology; 
24

(8) over the past 3 decades, cleaner fuel and 
1
advanced engines have combined to reduce nitrogen 
2
oxide (NOx) emissions by 97 percent and particulate 
3
matter (PM) emissions by 98 percent; 
4
(9) the Federal excise tax disproportionately 
5
impacts electric and alternative-fueled trucks, which 
6
currently have a higher up front cost, at a time 
7
when adoption of these technologies is needed to ac-
8
celerate the transition to zero emission vehicles and 
9
the reduction of carbon pollution from transpor-
10
tation; 
11
(10) there are approximately 1,300,000 United 
12
States manufacturing, supplier, dealership, and 
13
heavy-duty trucking and trailer related jobs; 
14
(11) since the Federal retail excise tax on cer-
15
tain new heavy trucks, tractors, and trailers is based 
16
on annual sales, receipts from the tax deposited in 
17
the Highway Trust Fund can vary greatly; 
18
(12) Congress should consider a more reliable 
19
and consistent revenue mechanism to fund the High-
20
way Trust Fund; 
21
(13) Congress should advance the deployment 
22
of the most modern, clean, and safe trucks through 
23
eliminating the Federal excise tax on trucks; and

(14) repealing the Federal excise tax would re-
1
sult in the replacement of older internal combustion 
2
engine trucks with new heavy duty trucks that em-
3
ploy the latest safety and environmental tech-
4
nologies.
