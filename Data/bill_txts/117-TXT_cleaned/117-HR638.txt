RESOLUTION 
Honoring Missourians who made the ultimate sacrifice in 
Afghanistan. 
Whereas Marine Corps Lance Corporal Jared Schmitz of 
Wentzville, Missouri, was a dear and loving son, brother, 
and friend, who sought constantly to lift those around 
him and care for others in need; 
Whereas Lance Corporal Schmitz was a devoted patriot who 
knew that he wanted to serve in the Marine Corps by his 
sophomore year of high school and trained relentlessly on 
his own initiative so that he might one day wear the 
Eagle, Globe, and Anchor; 
Whereas Lance Corporal Schmitz enlisted in the Marine 
Corps before his 18th birthday and went on to serve with 
gallantry as a Marine Corps infantryman, upholding the

standards and traditions of all the brave service members 
from the State of Missouri who came before him;

ians; 
Whereas, on August 26, 2021, at just 20 years of age, while 
serving alongside his fellow citizens to provide safe pas-
sage to those in need, Lance Corporal Schmitz made the 
ultimate sacrifice at the international airport in Kabul, 
giving his life so that others might live; and
