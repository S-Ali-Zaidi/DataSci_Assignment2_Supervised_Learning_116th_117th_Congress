SEC. 2. PURPOSE; FINDINGS. 
1
(a) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act is to assist 
2
States and local educational agencies with ensuring that 
3
every elementary and secondary school has at least one 
4
full-time registered nurse on staff, and to maintain rec-
5
ommended nurse-to-student ratios, including through the 
6
recruitment, hiring, and retention of registered nurses. 
7
(b) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
8
(1) According to the American Academy of Pe-
9
diatrics, every elementary and secondary school 
10
should have at least one full-time registered nurse 
11
on staff. 
12
(2) According to the National Center for Edu-
13
cation Statistics, during the 2015–2016 school year, 
14
only about half of all public schools had a full-time 
15
registered nurse and nearly 20 percent did not have 
16
any nurse on staff. Schools with higher free or re-
17
duced-price lunch program eligibility rates had lower 
18
rates of school nurses. 
19
(3) According to the Georgetown University 
20
Center for Children and Families, in 2019, roughly 
21
6 percent of children in the United States were un-
22
insured. 
23
(4) For children who lack health care coverage, 
24
a school nurse is often a critical source of health 
25
services.

•HR 8220 IH
(5) Studies suggest that schools with a full-time 
1
registered nurse experience far-reaching benefits in-
2
cluding fewer student absences, students spending 
3
more time in class, more accurate medical records, 
4
higher immunization rates, fewer student preg-
5
nancies, and better health outcomes for students 
6
with asthma or diabetes. 
7
(6) School nurses play a critical role in helping 
8
to manage the chronic physical, emotional, mental, 
9
and social health needs of students, conduct health 
10
screenings, facilitate vaccinations and immunization 
11
compliance efforts, reduce burdens on educators and 
12
other school staff, and support a positive and 
13
healthy school climate.
