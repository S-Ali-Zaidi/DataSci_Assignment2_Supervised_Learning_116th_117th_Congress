SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Sanctioning Tyrannical

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
5
Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) The Hong Kong National Security Law pro-
7
mulgated on July 1, 2020— 
8
(A) contravenes the Basic Law of the 
9
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region that 
10
provides in Article 23 that the Legislative 
11
Council of Hong Kong shall enact legislation re-
12
lated to national security; 
13
(B) violates the People’s Republic of Chi-
14
na’s commitments under international law, as 
15
defined by the Joint Declaration; and 
16
(C) causes severe and irreparable damage 
17
to the ‘‘one country, two systems’’ principle and 
18
further erodes global confidence in the People’s 
19
Republic of China’s commitment to inter-
20
national law. 
21
(2) Repression of ethnic Muslim minorities in 
22
the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of the 
23
People’s Republic of China has been ongoing, and 
24
was formalized with the ‘‘Strike Hard Campaign 
25
against Violent Terrorism’’ that began in 2014.

(3) The mass internment of Uyghur and other 
1
Muslim ethnic minorities in the Xinjiang Uyghur 
2
Autonomous Region has been ongoing since April 
3
2017. 
4
(4) The People’s Republic of China has con-
5
ducted a targeted and systemic population-control 
6
campaign against ethnic and religious minorities in 
7
the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region by impos-
8
ing and implementing coercive population-control 
9
practices, 
including 
selectively 
enforcing 
birth 
10
quotas, targeting minority women who are in non-
11
compliance with birth quotas, and subjecting women 
12
to coercive measures such as forced birth control, 
13
forced sterilization, and forced abortion. 
14
(5) On October 6, 2020, 39 countries delivered 
15
a cross-regional joint statement to the United States 
16
Mission to the United Nations on the human rights 
17
abuses on Uyghurs and other minorities for forced 
18
birth control including sterilization. 
19
(6) On January 19, 2021, the Department of 
20
State determined that the People’s Republic of 
21
China committed crimes against humanity and geno-
22
cide against Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious 
23
minority groups in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autono-
24
mous Region, citing forced sterilizations, forced

•HR 6686 IH
abortions, coerced marriages, and separation of 
1
Uyghur children from their families. 
2
(7) The Department of State’s 2020 Country 
3
Reports on Human Rights Practices affirmed the 
4
genocide determination and noted coercive popu-
5
lation control measures inflicted on ethnic and reli-
6
gious minority women in China, including forced in-
7
jections with ‘‘drugs that cause temporary or perma-
8
nent end to their menstrual cycles and fertility’’. 
9
(8) The United States ratified the United Na-
10
tions Convention on the Prevention and Punishment 
11
of Genocide in 1988, recognizing that ‘‘imposing 
12
measures intended to prevent births within the 
13
group’’ with intent to destroy a group in whole or 
14
part is an act that constitutes genocide. 
15
(9) Taiwan is a free and prosperous democracy 
16
of nearly 24,000,000 people and an important con-
17
tributor to peace and stability around the world. 
18
(10) Section 2(b) of the Taiwan Relations Act 
19
(Public Law 96–8; 22 U.S.C. 3301(b)) states that it 
20
is the policy of the United States— 
21
(A) ‘‘to preserve and promote extensive, 
22
close, and friendly commercial, cultural, and 
23
other relations between the people of the United 
24
States and the people on Taiwan, as well as the

people on the China mainland and all other peo-
1
ples of the Western Pacific area’’; 
2
(B) ‘‘to declare that peace and stability in 
3
the area are in the political, security, and eco-
4
nomic interests of the United States, and are 
5
matters of international concern’’; 
6
(C) ‘‘to make clear that the United States 
7
decision to establish diplomatic relations with 
8
the People’s Republic of China rests upon the 
9
expectation that the future of Taiwan will be 
10
determined by peaceful means’’; 
11
(D) ‘‘to consider any effort to determine 
12
the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful 
13
means, including by boycotts or embargoes, a 
14
threat to the peace and security of the Western 
15
Pacific area and of grave concern to the United 
16
States’’; 
17
(E) ‘‘to provide Taiwan with arms of a de-
18
fensive character’’; and 
19
(F) ‘‘to maintain the capacity of the 
20
United States to resist any resort to force or 
21
other forms of coercion that would jeopardize 
22
the security, or the social or economic system, 
23
of the people on Taiwan’’.

(11) Since the election of President Tsai Ing- 
1
wen as President of Taiwan in 2016, the Govern-
2
ment of the People’s Republic of China has intensi-
3
fied its efforts to pressure Taiwan through diplo-
4
matic isolation and military provocations. 
5
(12) The rapid modernization of the People’s 
6
Liberation Army and recent military maneuvers in 
7
and around the Taiwan Strait illustrate a clear 
8
threat to Taiwan’s security.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
10

11
munist Party, led by General Secretary Xi Jinping, has 
12
committed numerous human rights violations against the 
13
people of Hong Kong and the people of Taiwan, as well 
14
as genocide against Uyghur Muslims in the Xinjiang 
15
Uyghur Autonomous Region.
