SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds that: 
2
(1) Energy remains unaffordable for low-income 
3
households. Nationally, low-income households spend 
4
a larger portion of their income on home energy 
5
costs than other households. The average low-income 
6
household’s energy burden is 3 times that of other 
7
households. The report for the Household Pulse Sur-
8
vey of the Bureau of the Census, issued on Decem-
9
ber 22, 2021, noted that, for families with incomes 
10
of less than $35,000 a year, about 51 percent said 
11
that they reduced or went without basic household 
12
necessities, such as medicine or food, in order to pay 
13
an energy bill, for at least one month in the last 
14
year. 
15
(2) The Low-Income Housing Energy Assist-
16
ance Program was authorized by Congress to reduce 
17
home energy burdens with heating and cooling as-
18
sistance. In 2019, only 16 percent of income-eligible 
19
households received a subsidy under the program. 
20
(3) Climate change is fueling increasingly in-
21
tense winter storms and extreme temperatures. 
22
(4) Heat waves are increasingly common as cli-
23
mate change accelerates, and now occur more often 
24
in major cities across the United States. The aver-
25
age heat wave season across 50 cities is approxi-

mately 47 days longer now than it was in the 1960s. 
1
As a result, the Federal Government should provide 
2
further cooling assistance for communities in need. 
3
(5) The loss of home energy service due to high 
4
energy burdens is one of the primary reasons for 
5
homelessness, especially for families with children. 
6
In some housing contexts, loss of home energy serv-
7
ice is a grounds for eviction. 
8
(6) The Federal Government should expand and 
9
update the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance 
10
Program, as part of a robust Federal social safety 
11
net, to— 
12
(A) protect families against unaffordable 
13
home energy bills and home energy shutoffs, by 
14
providing sufficient funding and imposing regu-
15
lations where necessary; 
16
(B) ensure all low- and moderate-income 
17
families have access to affordable home cooling 
18
powered by renewable energy, which will enable 
19
households to adapt to rising temperatures due 
20
to climate change and promote climate resil-
21
iency; 
22
(C) enhance outreach— 
23
(i) by including nontraditional part-
24
ners, including home energy suppliers,

local educational agencies, and entities car-
1
rying out other programs for low-income 
2
people, to assist with signups; and 
3
(ii) by adding stronger provisions for 
4
presumed eligibility and waiving docu-
5
mentation requirements for eligibility; and 
6
(D) further Federal efforts to weatherize 
7
housing for low- and moderate-income house-

holds, to help families struggling to pay their 
9
home energy bills and to meet national clean
