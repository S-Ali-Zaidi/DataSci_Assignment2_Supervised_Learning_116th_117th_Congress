•HR 4986 IH
(2) For millions of Americans with low or mod-
1
erate levels of income, their tax refund is the single 
2
largest source of income for the entire year. 
3
(3) Financial insecurity extends far up the in-
4
come spectrum, as too few Americans have sufficient 
5
financial savings, and 1 in every 3 Americans has no 
6
financial savings at all. 
7
(4) Forty percent of American families do not 
8
have enough liquidity to pay for a $400 ‘‘rainy day’’ 
9
expense, and 40 percent of Americans are liquid 
10
asset poor, with emergency savings that are too 
11
small to cover basic needs in the event of a surprise 
12
expense or reduction in income.
