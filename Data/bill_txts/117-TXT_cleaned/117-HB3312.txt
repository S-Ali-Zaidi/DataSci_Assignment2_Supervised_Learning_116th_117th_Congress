This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Real Education and

SEC. 2. PURPOSE AND FINDINGS. 
6
(a) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act is to provide 
7
young people with sex education and sexual health services 
8
that— 
9
(1) promote and uphold the rights of young 
10
people to information and services that empower 
11
them to make decisions about their bodies, health, 
12
sexuality, families, and communities in all areas of 
13
life; 
14
(2) are evidence-informed, comprehensive in 
15
scope, confidential, equitable, accessible, medically 
16
accurate and complete, age and developmentally ap-
17
propriate, culturally responsive, and trauma-in-
18
formed and resilience-oriented; 
19
(3) provide information about the prevention, 
20
treatment, and care of pregnancy, sexually trans-
21
mitted infections, and interpersonal violence; 
22
(4) provide information about the importance of 
23
consent as a basis for healthy relationships and for 
24
autonomy in healthcare;

(5) provide information on gender roles and 
1
gender discrimination; 
2
(6) provide information on the historical and 
3
current condition in which education and health sys-
4
tems, policies, programs, services, and practices have 
5
uniquely and adversely impacted Black, Indigenous, 
6
Latinx, Asian, Asian American and Pacific Islander, 
7
and other People of Color; and 
8
(7) redress inequities in the delivery of sex edu-
9
cation and sexual health services to marginalized 
10
young people. 
11
(b) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
12
(1) Young people need and have the right to sex 
13
education and sexual health services that are evi-
14
dence-informed, comprehensive in scope, confiden-
15
tial, equitable, accessible, medically accurate and 
16
complete, age and developmentally appropriate, cul-
17
turally responsive, and trauma-informed and resil-
18
ience-oriented. 
19
(2) Currently, there is a gap between the sex 
20
education that young people should be receiving 
21
based on expert standards and the sex education 
22
many actually receive. 
23
(3) Only 29 States and the District of Colum-
24
bia mandate sex education in schools. 
25

•HR 3312 IH
(4) When there is sex education or instruction 
1
regarding human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or 
2
sexually transmitted infections (STI), 15 States do 
3
not require the content to be evidence-informed, 
4
medically accurate and complete, age and develop-
5
mentally appropriate, or culturally responsive. 
6
(5) Many sex education programs and sexual 
7
health services currently available were not designed 
8
to and do not currently meet the needs of 
9
marginalized young people. Some such programs and 
10
services actually harm marginalized young people. 
11
(6) For marginalized young people, a lack of 
12
comprehensive in scope, confidential, equitable, and 
13
accessible sex education and sexual health services is 
14
not unfamiliar, but rather a longstanding manifesta-
15
tion of white supremacy, which has touched every 
16
aspect of our history, culture, and institutions, in-
17
cluding the education and healthcare systems. 
18
(7) The development and delivery of sexual 
19
health education and services in the United States 
20
historically has been rooted in the oppression of 
21
Black, Indigenous, Latinx, Asian, Asian American 
22
and Pacific Islander, and other People of Color. 
23
(8) The United States has a long history of eu-
24
genics and forced sterilization. The sexual and re-

productive rights and bodily autonomy of specific 
1
communities deemed ‘‘undesirable’’ or ‘‘defective’’ 
2
were targeted by our governments resulting in state- 
3
sanctioned violence and generations of trauma and 
4
oppression. These communities include— 
5
(A) people with low incomes; 
6
(B) immigrants; 
7
(C) people with disabilities; 
8
(D) people living with HIV; 
9
(E) survivors of interpersonal violence; 
10
(F) people who are incarcerated, detained, 
11
or who otherwise have encountered the crimi-
12
nal-legal system; 
13
(G) Black, Indigenous, and other People of 
14
Color; 
15
(H) people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
16
transgender, and queer; and 
17
(I) young people who are pregnant and 
18
parenting. 
19
(9) Black young people are more likely to re-
20
ceive abstinence-only instruction. Research shows 
21
that abstinence-only instruction, also known as ‘‘sex-
22
ual risk avoidance’’ instruction, is ineffective in com-
23
parison to sex education.

(10) Black, Indigenous, and Latinx young peo-
1
ple are disproportionately more likely to be diag-
2
nosed with an STI, have an unintended pregnancy, 
3
or experience sexual assault. 
4
(11) The framework of Reproductive Justice ac-
5
knowledges and aims to address the legacy of white 
6
supremacy, systemic oppression, and the restrictions 
7
on sex education and sexual health services that dis-
8
proportionately impact marginalized communities. 
9
Reproductive Justice will be achieved when all people 
10
regardless of actual or perceived race, color, eth-
11
nicity, national origin, religion, immigration status, 
12
sex (including gender identity and sexual orienta-
13
tion), disability status, pregnancy or parenting sta-
14
tus, or age have the power to make decisions about 
15
their bodies, health, sexuality, families, and commu-
16
nities in all areas of life. 
17
(12) Increased resources are required for sex 
18
education and sexual health services to reach all 
19
young people, redress inequities and their impacts 
20
on marginalized young people, and achieve Repro-
21
ductive Justice for young people.
