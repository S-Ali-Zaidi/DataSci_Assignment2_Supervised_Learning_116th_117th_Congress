(2) 19 of those 72 hours per week are consid-
1
ered to be overtime hours for purposes of computing

pay; 
3
(3) the pay computed for those 19 overtime 
4
hours each week are not accurately accounted for

fits; and

reduced retirement benefits for Federal firefighters.

the manner in which retirement benefits for Federal fire-
11
fighters are computed so as to account for pay earned for

of duty.
