1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2

4
Stalls Act of 2022’’ or the ‘‘PIGS Act of 2022’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress makes the following findings: 
7
(1) Intensive confinement of pigs is a signifi-
8
cant animal welfare issue, causing physical problems 
9
and psychological anguish for the animals.

(2) Dozens of major food retailers and more 
1
than 10 states have taken action to phase out the 
2
use of intensive confinement for pigs, reflecting the 
3
will and concerns of the public. 
4
(3) At least two States have adopted policies to 
5
forbid the sale of pork from factory farms that use 
6
gestation crates, with that policy predicated on 
7
human health and animal welfare concerns. 
8
(4) As more consumers turn away from pur-
9
chasing pork products derived from intensive con-
10
finement practices, the pork industry will be better 
11
aligned with its customers by ending these unpopu-
12
lar and inhumane housing methods.
