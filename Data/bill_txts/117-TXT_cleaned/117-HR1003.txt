RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for designation of a Welcome Home 
Vietnam Veterans Day. 
Whereas the Vietnam War was fought in Vietnam from 1961 
to 1975, and involved North Vietnam and the Viet Cong 
in conflict with the United States Armed Forces and 
South Vietnam; 
Whereas the United States became involved in Vietnam be-
cause policymakers in the United States believed that if 
South Vietnam fell to a Communist government then 
Communism would spread throughout the rest of South-
east Asia;

Whereas members of the United States Armed Forces began 
serving in an advisory role to the South Vietnamese in 
1961; 
Whereas, as a result of the Gulf of Tonkin incidents on Au-
gust 2, 1964, and August 4, 1964, Congress overwhelm-
ingly passed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, on August 7, 
1964, which effectively handed over war-making powers 
to President Johnson until such time as ‘‘peace and secu-
rity’’ had returned to Vietnam; 
Whereas, in 1965, United States Armed Forces ground com-
bat units arrived in Vietnam; 
Whereas, by the end of 1965, there were 80,000 United

mately 543,000 troops was reached; 
Whereas, on January 27, 1973, the Treaty of Paris was

Vietnam; 
Whereas, on March 29, 1973, the United States Armed 
Forces completed the withdrawal of combat troops from

Whereas the Vietnam War was an extremely divisive issue 
among the people of the United States; 
Whereas members of the United States Armed Forces who 
served bravely and faithfully for the United States during 
the Vietnam War were caught upon their return home in 
the crossfire of public debate about the involvement of 
the United States in the Vietnam War; 
Whereas the establishment of a Welcome Home Vietnam Vet-
erans Day would be an appropriate way to honor those 
members of the United States Armed Forces who served 
in Vietnam during the Vietnam War; and 
Whereas the last Saturday of March, 2022, would be an ap-
propriate day to establish as ‘‘Welcome Home Vietnam 
Veterans Day’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the designation of Welcome Home 
2
Vietnam Veterans Day; 
3
(2) honors and recognizes the contributions of 
4
veterans of the Armed Forces who served in Viet-
5
nam; and 
6
(3) encourages the people of the United States 
7
to observe Welcome Home Vietnam Veterans Day 
8
with appropriate ceremonies and activities that pro-
9
mote awareness of the contributions of veterans who 
10
served in Vietnam and the importance of helping 
11
Vietnam era veterans re-adjust to civilian life.
