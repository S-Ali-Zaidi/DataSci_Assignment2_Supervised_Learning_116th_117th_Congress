A BILL 
To direct the Secretary of Transportation to carry out a 
grant program to support efforts to provide fare-free 
transit service, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Freedom to Move Act’’. 
4
SEC. 2. PURPOSE. 
5
The purposes of this Act are— 
6
(1) to invest in State, county, and local munici-
7
palities efforts to provide fare-free public transpor-
8
tation; and 
9

(2) to support State, county, and local munici-
1
palities in improving and expanding access to safe, 
2
accessible, and reliable mass transit systems in order 
3
to improve the livability of communities. 
4
SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
5
Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) Increasing access to safe, reliable, and af-
7
fordable public transit systems, including buses, 
8
light rail, and subways can help increase community 
9
livability and mobility to critical services such as 
10
education, jobs, and healthcare. 
11
(2) The cost of transit fares can act as a chal-
12
lenging economic barrier for low-income individuals 
13
and families who are most likely to rely on public 
14
transportation to access critical services and must 
15
spend larger parts of their household budget on 
16
transportation services. Removing economic barriers 
17
to safe, reliable, and affordable public transit, can 
18
help to increase social and economic mobility by in-
19
creasing access to education, training, and employ-
20
ment. 
21
(3) Individuals with disabilities are twice as 
22
likely as those without disabilities to have inadequate 
23
access to safe, affordable, and reliable transpor-
24
tation. Reports have found that of the nearly 2 mil-
25
01:36 May 26, 2021

•HR 2287 IH
lion people with disabilities who are unable to leave 
1
their homes, nearly 30 percent is due to lack of ade-
2
quate transportation. 
3
(4) As the senior population continues to grow, 
4
an increasing number of elderly adults depend on 
5
public transit to access medical care and other vital 
6
services. Additionally, the percentage of 13 to 34- 
7
year-olds without a driver’s license continues to 
8
grow. Taken together, these trends show the unprec-
9
edented urgency of investing in and improving our 
10
public transit systems. 
11
(5) According to the Department of Transpor-
12
tation, transportation accounts for 29 percent of 
13
greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. Pub-
14
lic transportation, however, produces significantly 
15
lower greenhouse gas emissions per passenger mile 
16
than by private vehicles. Increasing public transit 
17
ridership and moving more people to and from crit-
18
ical services with fewer vehicles on the road can re-
19
duce greenhouse gas emissions. 
20
(6) Eliminating transit fares and significantly 
21
reducing economic barriers to public transit will help 
22
to reduce the need for fare evasion policies that dis-
23
proportionately criminalize low-income individuals 
24
and people of color.
