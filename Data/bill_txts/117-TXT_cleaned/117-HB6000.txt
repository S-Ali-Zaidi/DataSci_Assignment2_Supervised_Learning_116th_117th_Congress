SEC. 411. MEANINGFUL ACCESS TO FEDERAL HEALTH 
17
PLAN CLAIMS DATA. 
18
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds as follows: 
19
(1) Clinician-led clinical data registries serve an 
20
important role in promoting, facilitating, and con-
21
ducting medical research and improving quality of 
22
healthcare by providing timely and actionable feed-
23
back to practitioners on their performance in rela-
24
tion to other practitioners and best clinical practices. 
25
00:46 Dec 02, 2021
H6000
131 
•HR 6000 IH
(2) Clinician-led clinical data registries are hin-
1
dered in their ability to promote medical research 
2
and quality improvement by their lack of meaningful 
3
access to claims data. 
4
(3) While the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid 
5
Services has established programs for providing ac-
6
cess to claims data, those programs fail to provide 
7
clinician-led clinical data registries with meaningful 
8
access to such data. 
9
(4) Ensuring clinician-led clinical data reg-
10
istries meaningful access to claims data will enable 
11
such entities to better track patient outcomes over 
12
time, expand their ability to assess the safety and ef-
13
fectiveness of medical treatments, and provide them 
14
with the information necessary to assess the cost-ef-
15
fectiveness of therapies.

TO CLAIMS 
17
DATA.—
