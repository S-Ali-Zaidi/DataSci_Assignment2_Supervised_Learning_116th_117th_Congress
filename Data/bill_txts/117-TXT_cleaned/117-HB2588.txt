8
more than 50 percent of older veterans, who are 
9
using the health care system of the Department of 
10
Veterans Affairs living with some form of chronic 
11
pain. 
12
(2) In 2018, opioids accounted for approxi-
13
mately 70 percent of all drug overdose deaths in the 
14
United States.

(3) Veterans are twice as likely to die from 
16
opioid related overdoses than nonveterans. 
17
(4) States with medical cannabis laws have a 
18
24.8 percent lower mean annual opioid overdose 
19
mortality rate compared with States without medical 
20
cannabis laws. 
21

22
for treating a wide-range of diseases and disorders,
