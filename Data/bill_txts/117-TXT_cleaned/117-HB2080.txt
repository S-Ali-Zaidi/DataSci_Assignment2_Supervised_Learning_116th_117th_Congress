tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The Kaiser Family Foundation reported 
3
that only about 12 percent of Medicare beneficiaries 
4
are full Medicare-Medicaid dual eligibles and, thus, 
5
have Medicaid coverage for nonemergency medical 
6
transportation (NEMT) to access COVID–19 vac-
7
cination appointments and other health care ap-
8
pointments. According to the Commonwealth Fund, 
9
although 45 percent of Medicare beneficiaries have 
10
incomes lower than 200 percent of the federal pov-
11
erty level (FPL), which can limit their transpor-
12
tation options, Medicare does not currently cover 
13
NEMT. 
14
(2) Medicare beneficiaries over the age of 65, 
15
according to the Centers for Disease Control, are 24 
16
times more likely to die from COVID–19 than an 
17
adult aged 25–54. 
18
(3) A managed NEMT benefit that offers 
19
scheduling and other assistance would improve bene-
20
ficiaries’ access to the COVID–19 vaccine. It also 
21
would reduce Medicare expenditures by covering 
22
more cost-effective alternatives and avoiding the 
23
high cost of in-patient COVID–19 treatment.
