(1) to enhance competition in the pharma-
3
ceutical market by stopping anticompetitive practices 
4
that limit or prevent competition from generic drugs 
5
and biosimilar biological products,

12
DECISIONS. 
13
(a) PROHIBITION.—It shall be unlawful for a phar-
14
maceutical manufacturer— 
15
(1) to provide any item or service, or anything 
16
of value, for the purpose of aiding or assisting a 
17
health care provider to request or direct that a drug 
18
be dispensed ‘‘as written’’ or ‘‘brand name only’’ 
19
when a generic drug or biosimilar biological product 
20
is available, including any prescription notepad or 
21
prescription stamp, but not including any product 
22
sample, or 
23
(2) to direct a health care provider to write 
24
‘‘dispense as written’’, ‘‘brand name only’’, or an-
25
other similar notation or direction on a prescription

when a generic drug or biosimilar biological product

is available.

(b) LIMITATION.—Nothing in this section prevents a 
3
health care provider from exercising the provider’s own 
4
medical judgment to prescribe any drug or biologic prod-

uct.

(c) CIVIL PENALTY ACTIONS.—If the Commission 
7
has reason to believe that a pharmaceutical manufacturer 
8
has violated or is violating this Act, the Federal Trade 
9
Commission may commence a civil action to recover a civil 
10
penalty and seek other appropriate relief in a district court 
11
of the United States against the pharmaceutical manufac-
12
turer. Except as otherwise provided in section 16(a)(2) of 
13
the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 56(a)(3)), 
14
the Commission shall have exclusive authority to com-
15
mence or defend, and supervise the litigation of, any civil 
16
action under paragraph (1) and any appeal of such action 
17
in its own name by any of its attorneys designated by it 
18
for such purpose, unless the Commission authorizes the 
19
Attorney General to do so. The Commission shall inform 
20
the Attorney General of the exercise of such authority and 
21
such exercise shall not preclude the Attorney General from 
22
intervening on behalf of the United States in such action 
23
and any appeal of such action as may be otherwise pro-
24
vided by law. The civil penalty shall be sufficient to deter

violations of this section, but in no event shall be greater 
1
than three times the gross revenues received for sales of 
2
the brand-name drug during the period in which the pro-
3
hibited conduct occurred. In determining the amount of 
4
the civil penalty, the court shall take into account— 
5
(1) the nature, circumstances, extent, and grav-
6
ity of the violation with respect to the pharma-
7
ceutical manufacturer, 
8
(2) the degree of culpability, 
9
(3) the history of violations, 
10
(4) the ability to pay, and any effect on the 
11
ability to continue doing business, and 
12
(5) other matters that justice requires. 
13
(d) UNFAIR METHOD OF COMPETITION.—A violation 
14
of this Act shall also constitute an unfair method of com-
15
petition under section 5(a)(1) of the Federal Trade Com-
16
mission Act (15 U.S.C. 45(a)(1)). 
17
(e) ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY.—Except as other-
18
wise provided in subsection (c), the Commission shall en-
19
force this Act in the same manner, by the same means, 
20
and with the same jurisdiction, powers, and duties as 
21
though all applicable terms and provisions of the Federal 
22
Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.) were incor-
23
porated into and made a part of this Act.
