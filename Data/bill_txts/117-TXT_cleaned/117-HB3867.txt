SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Congress has the authority under article 1, 
3
section 4 of the Constitution of the United States to 
4
enact laws governing the time, place, and manner of 
5
Federal elections. 
6
(2) Congress has the authority under section 2 
7
of the 15th Amendment to enforce the right of citi-
8
zens of the United States to vote, which shall not be 
9
denied or abridged by the United States, by legisla-
10
tion. 
11
(3) Section 1 of the 14th Amendment guaran-
12
tees due process of law and equal protection of the 
13
laws. 
14
(4) The right to vote is the foundation of Amer-
15
ican democracy. Voting provides the citizenry with a 
16
vital check on their elected officials and grants peo-
17
ple the political power necessary to exercise and de-
18
fend the rights guaranteed by the United States 
19
Constitution. 
20
(5) As Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. explained in 
21
a speech delivered on May 17, 1957, ‘‘So long as I 
22
do not firmly and irrevocably possess the right to 
23
vote I do not possess myself. I cannot make up my 
24
mind—it is made up for me. I cannot live as a 
25

•HR 3867 IH
democratic citizen, observing the laws I have helped 
1
to enact—I can only submit to the edict of others’’. 
2
(6) The right to vote for all Americans is fun-
3
damental and rules for voting and election adminis-
4
tration should protect the right to vote and promote 
5
voter participation. 
6
(7) Waiting in long lines discourages people 
7
from voting, undermines confidence in the electoral 
8
system, and imposes economic costs on voters. 
9
(8) Multiple studies have shown that voters of 
10
all races are more likely to wait in line to vote longer 
11
in counties with higher population density, and 
12
Latino and Black voters disproportionately live in 
13
these areas. 
14
(9) One way voting in communities of color has 
15
been suppressed is through long waits at polling lo-
16
cations. Studies have shown a number of contrib-
17
uting factors, including the drastic reduction of early 
18
voting days, poor allocation of resources to certain 
19
communities, cuts to election funding, and a reduc-
20
tion of polling locations. 
21
(10) These problems led to the creation of the 
22
bipartisan Presidential Commission on Election Ad-
23
ministration, which issued a 2014 report that set 
24
04:46 Jul 14, 2021
H3867
4 
•HR 3867 IH
forth a standard: ‘‘No citizen should have to wait 
1
more than 30 minutes to vote’’. 
2
(11) Basic constitutional principles of fairness 
3
and equal protection require an equal opportunity 
4
for citizens of the United States to vote in Federal 
5
elections. The right to vote may not be abridged or 
6
denied by the United States or by any State on ac-
7
count of race, color, gender, or previous condition of 
8
servitude. The 13th, 14th, 15th, 19th, 24th, and 
9
26th Amendments to the Constitution empower Con-
10
gress to enact measures to protect the right to vote 
11
in Federal elections. The 8th Amendment to the 
12
Constitution provides for no excessive bail to be re-
13
quired, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and 
14
unusual punishments inflicted. 
15
(12) American Indian and Alaska Native voters 
16
face unique obstacles in a vote-by-mail system. Trib-
17
al communities in rural areas often do not have tra-
18
ditional residential mailing addresses and have lim-
19
ited access to transportation. Tribal members have 
20
distant rural post offices, slow mail routes, limited 
21
numbers of post office operation, and too few post 
22
office boxes. As a result, rural Tribal communities 
23
require distinct voting accommodations to ensure 
24
participation in a vote-by-mail system.
