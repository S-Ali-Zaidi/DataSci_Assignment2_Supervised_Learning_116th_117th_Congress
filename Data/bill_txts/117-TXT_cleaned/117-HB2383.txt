SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Khalid Jabara and 
2
Heather Heyer National Opposition to Hate, Assault, and 
3
Threats to Equality Act of 2021’’ or the ‘‘Jabara-Heyer 
4
NO HATE Act of 2021’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) The incidence of violence known as hate 
8
crimes or crimes motivated by bias poses a serious 
9
national problem. 
10
(2) According to data obtained by the Federal 
11
Bureau of Investigation, the incidence of such vio-
12
lence increased in 2019, the most recent year for 
13
which data is available. 
14
(3) In 1990, Congress enacted the Hate Crime 
15
Statistics Act (Public Law 101–275; 28 U.S.C. 534 
16
note) to provide the Federal Government, law en-
17
forcement agencies, and the public with data regard-
18
ing the incidence of hate crime. The Hate Crimes 
19
Statistics Act and the Matthew Shepard and James 
20
Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act (division E of 
21
Public Law 111–84; 123 Stat. 2835) have enabled 
22
Federal authorities to understand and, where appro-
23
priate, investigate and prosecute hate crimes. 
24
(4) A more complete understanding of the na-
25
tional problem posed by hate crime is in the public 
26

interest and supports the Federal interest in eradi-
1
cating bias-motivated violence referenced in section 
2
249(b)(1)(C) of title 18, United States Code. 
3
(5) However, a complete understanding of the 
4
national problem posed by hate crimes is hindered 
5
by incomplete data from Federal, State, and local 
6
jurisdictions through the Uniform Crime Reports 
7
program authorized under section 534 of title 28, 
8
United States Code, and administered by the Fed-
9
eral Bureau of Investigation. 
10
(6) Multiple factors contribute to the provision 
11
of inaccurate and incomplete data regarding the in-
12
cidence of hate crime through the Uniform Crime 
13
Reports program. A significant contributing factor is 
14
the quality and quantity of training that State and 
15
local law enforcement agencies receive on the identi-
16
fication and reporting of suspected bias-motivated 
17
crimes. 
18
(7) The problem of crimes motivated by bias is 
19
sufficiently serious, widespread, and interstate in na-
20
ture as to warrant Federal financial assistance to 
21
States and local jurisdictions. 
22
(8) Federal financial assistance with regard to 
23
certain violent crimes motivated by bias enables Fed-
24
eral, State, and local authorities to work together as 
25
