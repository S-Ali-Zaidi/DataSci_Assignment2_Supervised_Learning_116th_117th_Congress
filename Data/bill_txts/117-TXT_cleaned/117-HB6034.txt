It is the sense of Congress that—

(1) it is a United States national security pri-
1
ority that United States Government mission per-

sonnel are able to fully execute their duties, includ-
3
ing— 
4
(A) providing United States citizen services 
5
that are often a matter of life and death in in-
6
secure places;

(B) meeting with foreign officials, includ-
8
ing government and nongovernment, civil soci-
9
ety, private sector, and members of the press, 
10
to advance United States national security pri-
11
orities; and 
12
(C) understanding, engaging, and report-
13
ing on foreign political, social, and economic 
14
conditions; 
15
(2) a risk-averse environment that inhibits the 
16
execution of these fundamental duties undermines 
17
the national security interests of the United States 
18
and contributes to the further militarization of 
19
United States foreign policy as military and intel-
20
ligence agencies may experience fewer security re-
21
strictions and greater risk tolerance in the wake of 
22
security incidents; and 
23
(3) Congress has a role to play in addressing 
24
the negative impacts of an increasingly risk-averse
