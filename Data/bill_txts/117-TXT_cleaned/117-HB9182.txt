Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:

•HR 9182 IH
(1) Electric vehicles will play an important role 
1
in transitioning to a cleaner transportation system 
2
that protects Americans’ health and our planet. Ac-
3
cording to the United States Department of Energy, 
4
electric vehicles ‘‘produce fewer emissions that con-
5
tribute to climate change and smog than conven-
6
tional vehicles.’’. 
7
(2) Electric vehicles are becoming more popular 
8
among American consumers. United States sales of 
9
electric vehicles increased 27 percent between 2016 
10
and 2017, and 81 percent between 2017 and 2018, 
11
achieving a record sales volume of 361,307 units. 
12
(3) Access to electric vehicle charging stations 
13
is currently insufficient to meet consumer demand. 
14
According to the National Renewable Energy Lab-
15
oratory, ‘‘two key areas of needed improvement in 
16
actual vehicle charging are speed (reducing battery 
17
charging times) and coverage (having adequate and 
18
accessible charging stations)’’. 
19
(4) Demand for publicly accessible electric vehi-
20
cle chargers is projected to grow. There are an esti-
21
mated 41,878 publicly available electric vehicle di-
22
rect current fast charging stations (DC Fast and 
23
Level 2) with 101,296 charging outlets available in 
24
the United States. A report released in April 2021 
25

•HR 9182 IH
by Lawrence Berkeley Labs at the University of 
1
California-Berkley, estimated that the number of EV 
2
chargers required to support the accelerated transi-
3
tion necessary to meet GHG was 8.1 million public 
4
EV charge points by 2050. 
5
(5) In August 2020, cumulative U.S. plug-in 
6
electric vehicle sales reached 1.6 million units. In 
7
February 2021, 53,247 electric vehicles were sold in 
8
the United States, a 64.8-percent increase from the 
9
electric vehicle sales in February 2020. 
10
(6) However, China and the European Union 
11
are exceeding the United States in the EV manufac-
12
turing sector. China is the world leader in total EV 
13
production and total EV sales; 45 percent of global 
14
electric vehicles were built and sold in China. China 
15
also already produces the global majority of pas-
16
senger EVs (60 percent) and is expected to produce 
17
65 percent of global lithium-ion batteries by 2021. 
18
Currently, China has 7 of the 10 largest lithium-ion 
19
mega-factories by production capacity, while the 
20
United States only has one. Europe accounted for 
21
24 percent of the global EV fleet in 2018. In order 
22
for the United States to remain a competitor in auto 
23
manufacturing, the U.S. must greatly increase in-

vestment in the infrastructure necessary for wide 
1
adoption of EVs. 
2
(7) Americans demand the freedom to roam 
3
with their electric vehicle and convenient charging 
4
opportunities. However, failure to expand access to 
5
publicly accessible electric vehicle chargers will pre-
6
vent the wider adoption of electric vehicles and, 
7
therefore, hinder progress towards a more sustain-
8
able transportation system. According to a study 
9
produced by the Michigan Energy Office and Michi-
10
gan State University, ‘‘limited charging infrastruc-
11
ture for electric vehicles has been one of the main 
12
barriers in adopting these vehicles’’. 
13
(8) Expediting the wider adoption of electric ve-
14
hicles will require considerable changes to consumer 
15
behavior, which will not be possible without the cre-
16
ation of necessary infrastructure. According to a 
17
study produced by the Transportation Research 
18
Board and National Research Council, ‘‘adoption 
19
and diffusion of new innovations can be a long-term, 
20
complicated process that is especially slow for prod-
21
ucts that cost tens of thousands of dollars and where 
22
consumers have questions about infrastructure avail-
23
ability, resale value, and other variables’’, and ‘‘a 
24
perception of a lack of public charging infrastructure 
25
01:02 Oct 22, 2022

•HR 9182 IH
might hinder [plug-in electric vehicle] deployment.’’. 
1
Thus, greatly expanding access to publicly accessible 
2
electric vehicle chargers will be essential to changing 
3
consumer behavior radically and, accordingly, accel-
4
erating the wider adoption of electric vehicles. 
5
(b) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act is to estab-
6
lish a network of electric vehicle charging stations along 
7
eligible roads so that the United States may lead the world 
8
in protecting the environment while improving consumer 
9
experiences. The implementation of this Act will encourage 
10
the widespread adoption of light-, medium-, and heavy- 
11
duty electric vehicles by— 
12
(1) establishing a convenient system of charging 
13
networks; 
14
(2) allowing drivers to charge vehicles more 
15
quickly; and 
16
(3) ensuring that vehicle charging is equitably 
17
accessible and reasonably priced, enabling long-dis-
18
tance travel along eligible roads.
