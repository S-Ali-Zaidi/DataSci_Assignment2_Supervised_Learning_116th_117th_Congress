A BILL 
To amend the Public Health Service Act to establish a Pros-
tate Cancer Coordinating Committee, and for other pur-
poses. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Prostate Cancer Com-
4
munity Assistance, Research and Education Act of 2022’’ 
5
or the ‘‘PC–CARE Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
7
Congress finds the following: 
8
(1) Prostate cancer is the most commonly diag-
9
nosed non-skin cancer and the second leading cause 
10

of cancer-related deaths among men in the United 
1
States. 
2
(2) Over 3,100,000 men in the United States 
3
live with a prostate cancer diagnosis and it is esti-
4
mated that in 2021, 248,530 men will be diagnosed 
5
with, and more than 34,130 men will die of, prostate 
6
cancer. 
7
(3) Men with at least one close relative who has 
8
been diagnosed with prostate cancer have twice the 
9
risk of having prostate cancer compared to the gen-
10
eral population. 
11
(4) At least 12 percent of men with metastatic 
12
prostate cancer have inherited predispositions to the 
13
disease and potentially actionable genomic alter-
14
ations have been identified in over 90 percent of 
15
men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate 
16
cancer. 
17
(5) Advances in science to identify, test, and 
18
treat these men at increased genetic risk of disease 
19
are needed. 
20
(6) African-American men suffer from a pros-
21
tate cancer incidence rate that is significantly higher 
22
than that of White men and have more than double 
23
the prostate cancer mortality rate than that of 
24
White men.

(7) Research has shown that veterans exposed 
1
to herbicides, such as Agent Orange, are at higher 
2
risk for and more likely to be diagnosed with aggres-
3
sive forms of prostate cancer. 
4
(8) Screening by a digital rectal examination 
5
and a prostate-specific antigen blood test can detect 
6
the disease at the earlier, more treatable stages. 
7
(9) Men diagnosed with early stage disease have 
8
a nearly 100 percent 5-year survival rate but only 
9
30 percent of men survive more than 5 years if diag-
10
nosed with prostate cancer after the cancer has me-
11
tastasized. 
12
(10) Early-staged prostate cancer has no symp-
13
toms, raising the importance of early detection and 
14
screening. 
15
(11) The Department of Health and Human 
16
Services, the Department of Defense, and the De-
17
partment of Veterans Affairs all have a role in pro-
18
viding care for and conducting research on prostate 
19
cancer. 
20
(12) Multiple institutes at the National Insti-
21
tutes of Health are engaged in prostate cancer care 
22
and research, including the National Cancer Insti-
23
tute, National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and 
24
Bioengineering, the National Institute on Minority

Health and Health Disparities, and the Clinical Cen-
1
ter. 
2
(13) Additional agencies and offices within the 
3
Department of Health and Human Services conduct 
4
activities related to prostate cancer, including the 
5
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the 
6
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the 
7
Food and Drug Administration, the Health Re-
8
sources and Services Administration, the Office of 
9
Minority Health, and the Agency for Healthcare Re-
10
search and Quality. 
11
(14) The Department of Defense created the 
12
Prostate Cancer Research Program in 1997 and has 
13
funded more than $2,000,000,000 in prostate cancer 
14
research since that time. 
15
(15) Private foundations have provided substan-
16
tial funding to the prostate cancer research commu-
17
nity for almost three decades, including support for 
18
over 200 cancer centers and universities. 
19
(16) The Director of the National Institutes of 
20
Health has partnered with private prostate cancer 
21
research groups to study to study biological and 
22
nonbiological factors associated aggressive prostate 
23
cancer in African-American men.

(17) The Secretary of Veterans Affairs has 
1
partnered with private foundations to establish pre-
2
cision oncology program hubs for prostate cancer. 
3
(18) The Director of the Centers for Disease 
4
Control and Prevention has partnered with multiple 
5
private stakeholder groups to increase awareness 
6
and education around prostate cancer in the general 
7
population and among high-risk groups. 
8
(19) Increased coordination of governmental 
9
and nongovernmental activities can reduce costs and 
10
increase effectiveness of ongoing work. 
11
(20) Joint planning and goal setting across the 
12
Government and private sector can create a pathway 
13
toward eliminating prostate cancer deaths and im-
14
proving care for millions of men.
