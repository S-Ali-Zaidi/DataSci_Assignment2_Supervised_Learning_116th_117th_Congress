SEC. 3. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) GENERAL FINDINGS ON CREDIT REPORT-
3
ING.— 
4
(A) 
Consumer 
reporting 
agencies 
5
(‘‘CRAs’’) are companies that collect, compile, 
6
and provide information about consumers in the 
7
form of consumer reports for certain permis-
8
sible statutory purposes under the Fair Credit 
9
Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.) 
10
(‘‘FCRA’’). The three largest CRAs in this 
11
country 
are 
Equifax, 
TransUnion, 
and 
12
Experian. These CRAs are referred to as na-
13
tionwide CRAs and the reports that they pre-
14
pare are commonly referred to as credit reports. 
15
Furnishers, such as creditors, lenders, and debt 
16
collection agencies, voluntarily submit informa-
17
tion to CRAs about their accounts such as the 
18
total amount for each loan or credit limit for 
19
each credit card and the consumer’s payment 
20
history on these products. Reports also include 
21
identifying information about a consumer, such 
22
as their birthdate, previous mailing addresses, 
23
and current and previous employers.

(B) In a December 2012 paper, ‘‘Key Di-
1
mensions and Processes in the U.S. Credit Re-
2
porting System: A review for how the nation’s 
3
largest credit bureaus manage consumer data’’, 
4
the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection 
5
(‘‘Consumer Bureau’’) noted that the three na-
6
tionwide CRAs maintain credit files on approxi-
7
mately 200 million adults and receive informa-
8
tion from about 10,000 furnishers. On a 
9
monthly basis, these furnishers provide infor-
10
mation on over 1.3 billion consumer credit ac-
11
counts or other trade lines. 
12
(C) The 10 largest institutions furnishing 
13
credit information to each of the nationwide 
14
CRAs account for more than half of all ac-
15
counts reflected in consumers’ credit files. 
16
(D) Consumer reports play an increasingly 
17
important role in the lives of American con-
18
sumers. Most creditors, for example, review 
19
these reports to make decisions about whether 
20
to extend credit to consumers and what terms 
21
and conditions to offer them. As such, informa-
22
tion contained in these reports affects whether 
23
a person is able to get a private education loan 
24
to pay for college costs, to secure a mortgage 
25
18:18 Aug 27, 2021

•HR 4120 IH
loan to buy a home, or to obtain a credit card, 
1
as well as the terms and conditions under which 
2
consumer credit products or services are offered 
3
to them. 
4
(E) Credit reports are also increasingly 
5
used for many noncredit decisions, including by 
6
landlords to determine whether to rent an 
7
apartment to a prospective tenant and by em-
8
ployers to decide whether to hire potential job 
9
applicants or to offer a promotion to existing 
10
employees. 
11
(F) CRAs have a statutory obligation to 
12
verify independently the accuracy and complete-
13
ness of information included on the reports that 
14
they provide. 
15
(G) The nationwide CRAs have failed to 
16
establish and follow reasonable procedures, as 
17
required by existing law, to establish the max-
18
imum level of accuracy of information contained 
19
on consumer reports. Given the repeated fail-
20
ures of these CRAs to comply with accuracy re-
21
quirements on their own, legislation is intended 
22
to provide them with detailed guidance improv-
23
ing the accuracy and completeness of informa-
24
tion contained in consumer reports, including 
25
18:18 Aug 27, 2021
H4120
7 
•HR 4120 IH
procedures, policies, and practices that these 
1
CRAs should already be following to ensure full 
2
compliance with their existing obligations. 
3
(H) The presence of inaccurate or incom-
4
plete information on these reports can result in 
5
substantial financial and emotional harm to 
6
consumers. Credit reporting errors can lead to 
7
the loss of a new employment opportunity or a 
8
denial of a promotion in an existing job, stop 
9
someone from being able to access credit on fa-
10
vorable terms, prevent a person from obtaining 
11
rental housing, or even trigger mental distress. 
12
(I) Current industry practices impose an 
13
unfair burden of proof on consumers trying to 
14
fix errors on their reports. 
15
(J) Consumer reports containing inac-
16
curate or incomplete credit information also un-
17
dermine the ability of creditors and lenders to 
18
effectively and accurately underwrite and price 
19
credit. 
20
(K) Recognizing that credit reporting af-
21
fects the lives of almost all consumers in this 
22
country and that the consequences of errors on 
23
a consumer report can be catastrophic for a 
24
consumer, the Consumer Bureau began accept-
25
18:18 Aug 27, 2021
H4120
8 
•HR 4120 IH
ing consumer complaints about credit reporting 
1
in October 2012. 
2
(L) As of early December 2019, the Con-
3
sumer Bureau has handled approximately 
4
391,560 credit reporting complaints about the 
5
top three CRAs, making credit reporting con-
6
sistently in the top third most-complained-about 
7
subject matter on which the Consumer Bureau 
8
accepts consumer complaints. Incorrect infor-
9
mation in reports and frustrations about bur-
10
densome and time-consuming process to dis-
11
puting items is are consistently top reported 
12
concerns from consumers. 
13
(M) Other common types of credit report-
14
ing complaints submitted to the Consumer Bu-
15
reau related to the improper use of a report, 
16
trouble obtaining a report or credit score, 
17
CRAs’ investigations, and credit monitoring or 
18
identity protection. 
19
(N) In the fall 2019 ‘‘Supervisory High-
20
lights’’, the Consumer Bureau noted that one or 
21
more of the largest CRAs continue to struggle 
22
to adequately oversee furnishers to ensure that 
23
they were adhering to the CRA’s vetting poli-
24
18:18 Aug 27, 2021
H4120

•HR 4120 IH
cies and to establish proper procedures to verify 
1
public record information. 
2
(O) According to the fall 2016 ‘‘Super-
3
visory Highlights’’, Consumer Bureau exam-
4
iners determined that one or more debt collec-
5
tors never investigated indirect disputes that 
6
lacked detail or were not accompanied by at-
7
tachments with relevant information from the 
8
consumer. Examiners also found that notifica-
9
tions sent to consumers about disputes consid-
10
ered frivolous failed to identify for the con-
11
sumers the type of material that they could pro-
12
vide in order for the debt collector to complete 
13
the investigation of the disputed item. 
14
(P) A February 2014 Consumer Bureau 
15
report titled ‘‘Credit Reporting Complaint 
16
Snapshot’’ found that consumers are confused 
17
about the extent to which the nationwide CRAs 
18
are required to provide them with validation 
19
and documentation of a debt that appears on 
20
their credit report. 
21
(Q) As evidence that the current system 
22
lacks sufficient market incentives for CRAs to 
23
develop more robust procedures to increase the 
24
accuracy and completeness of information on 
25
18:18 Aug 27, 2021
H4120

•HR 4120 IH
credit reports, litigation discovery documented 
1
by 
the 
National 
Consumer 
Law 
Center 
2
(‘‘NCLC’’), as part of a February 2019 report 
3
titled ‘‘Automated Injustice Redux: Ten Years 
4
after a Key Report, Consumers Are Still Frus-
5
trated Trying to Fix Credit Reporting Errors’’, 
6
showed that at least two of the three largest 
7
CRAs use quota systems to force employees to 
8
process disputes hastily and without the oppor-
9
tunity for conducting meaningful investigations. 
10
At least one nationwide CRA only allowed dis-
11
pute resolution staff 5 minutes to handle a con-
12
sumer’s call. Furthermore, these CRAs were 
13
found to have awarded bonuses for meeting 
14
quotas and punished those who didn’t meet pro-
15
duction numbers with probation. 
16
(R) Unlike most other business relation-
17
ships, where consumers can register their satis-
18
faction or unhappiness with a particular credit 
19
product or service simply by taking their busi-
20
ness elsewhere, consumers have no say in 
21
whether their information is included in the 
22
CRAs databases and limited legal remedies to 
23
hold the CRAs accountable for inaccuracies or 
24
poor service. 
25
18:18 Aug 27, 2021
H4120
11 
•HR 4120 IH
(S) Accordingly, despite the existing statu-
1
tory mandate for CRAs to follow reasonable 
2
procedures to assure the maximum possible ac-
3
curacy of the information whenever they pre-
4
pare consumer reports, numerous studies, the 
5
high volume of consumer complaints submitted 
6
to the Consumer Bureau about incorrect infor-
7
mation on consumer reports, and supervisory 
8
activities by the Consumer Bureau demonstrate 
9
that CRAs continue to skirt their obligations 
10
under the law. 
11
(2) INCORRECT
INFORMATION
ON
CONSUMER 
12
REPORTS.— 
13
(A) Consumers are entitled to dispute er-
14
rors on their consumer reports with either the 
15
CRA, who issued the report, or directly with 
16
furnishers, who supplied the account informa-
17
tion to the CRA, and request that mistakes be 
18
deleted or removed. Consumers, who believe an 
19
investigation has not correctly resolved their 
20
dispute, however, have few options, other than 
21
requesting that a statement about the dispute 
22
be included with their future reports. 
23
(B) CRAs have a statutory obligation 
24
under the FCRA to perform a reasonable inves-
25
18:18 Aug 27, 2021
H4120
12 
•HR 4120 IH
tigation by conducting a substantive and 
1
searching inquiry when a consumer disputes an 
2
item on their report. In doing so, CRAs must 
3
conduct an independent review about the accu-
4
racy of any disputed item and cannot merely 
5
rely 
on 
a 
furnisher’s 
‘‘rubber-stamp’’ 
6
verification of the integrity of the information 
7
they have provided to CRAs. 
8
(C) In ‘‘Report to Congress Under Section 
9
319 of the Fair and Accurate Credit Trans-
10
actions Act of 2003’’ released by the Federal 
11
Government in December 2012, found that 26 
12
percent of survey participants identified at least 
13
one potentially material error on their consumer 
14
reports, and 13 percent experienced a change in 
15
their credit score once the error was fixed. 
16
(D) Consumer Bureau examiners have 
17
identified repeated deficiencies with the nation-
18
wide CRAs’ information collection. In the fall 
19
2019 ‘‘Supervisory Highlights’’, the Consumer 
20
Bureau noted continued weaknesses with CRAs’ 
21
methods and processes for assuring maximum 
22
possible accuracy in their reports. Examiners 
23
also found, with certain exceptions, no quality 
24
18:18 Aug 27, 2021
H4120
13 
•HR 4120 IH
control policies and procedures in place to test 
1
consumer reports for accuracy. 
2
(E) In its ‘‘Credit Reporting Complaint 
3
Snapshot’’ released in February 2014, the Con-
4
sumer Bureau found that consumers were un-
5
certain about the depth and validity of the in-
6
vestigations performed about a disputed item. 
7
Consumers also expressed frustration that, even 
8
though they provided supporting materials that 
9
they believed demonstrated the inaccuracy of 
10
the information provided by furnishers, errors 
11
continued to remain on their reports. 
12
(F) In the winter 2015 ‘‘Supervisory High-
13
lights’’ released in March 2015, the Consumer 
14
Bureau reported that one or more nationwide 
15
CRAs failed to adequately fulfill their dispute- 
16
handling obligations, including by not for-
17
warding to furnishers all relevant information 
18
found in letters and supporting documents sup-
19
plied by consumers when they submitted dis-
20
putes failing to notify consumers that they had 
21
completed investigations, and not providing con-
22
sumers with the results of the CRAs’ reviews 
23
about their disputes. 
24
18:18 Aug 27, 2021
H4120
14 
•HR 4120 IH
(G) Consumer Bureau examiners also 
1
noted in the fall 2016 ‘‘Supervisory Highlights’’ 
2
released in October 2016 that one or more enti-
3
ties failed to provide adequate guidance and 
4
training to staff about how to differentiate 
5
FCRA disputes from general customer inquir-
6
ies, complaints, or debt validation requests. 
7
Consumer Bureau supervisors also directed one 
8
or more entities to develop and implement rea-
9
sonable procedures to ensure that direct and in-
10
direct disputes are appropriately logged, cat-
11
egorized, and resolved. 
12
(H) Consumers’ increasing frustration 
13
about the difficulties of trying to fix credit re-
14
porting errors, evidenced through the volume of 
15
consumer complaints related to errors sub-
16
mitted to the Consumer Bureau, are also 
17
echoed in another Federal Government study 
18
issued in January 2015. In the ‘‘Report to Con-
19
gress under Section 319 for the Fair and Accu-
20
rate Credit Transactions Act of 2003’’, the 
21
study found that nearly 70 percent (84 people) 
22
of participants from a previous survey that had 
23
filed disputes with CRAs continued to believe 
24
that at least some of the disputed information 
25
18:18 Aug 27, 2021
H4120
15 
•HR 4120 IH
remained inaccurate at the time of the follow- 
1
up survey. Despite these views, 50 percent (42 
2
people) of the survey participants decided to 
3
just give up trying to fix the errors, with only 
4
45 percent (38 people) of them planning to con-
5
tinue to try to resolve their disputes. 
6
(I) The consistently high volume of con-
7
sumer complaints submitted to the Consumer 
8
Bureau about credit reporting errors, coupled 
9
with the largest CRAs’ repeated quality control 
10
weaknesses found by Consumer Bureau exam-
11
iners, show that the nationwide CRAs have 
12
failed to establish and follow reasonable proce-
13
dures to assure maximum accuracy of informa-
14
tion and to conduct independent investigations 
15
of consumers’ disputes. These ongoing problems 
16
demonstrate the need for legislation to— 
17
(i) enhance obligations on furnishers 
18
to substantiate information and require 
19
furnishers to keep records for the same 
20
amount of time that adverse information 
21
about these accounts may appear on a per-
22
son’s consumer report; 
23
(ii) eliminate CRAs’ discretion to de-
24
termine the relevancy of materials provided 
25
18:18 Aug 27, 2021
H4120
16 
•HR 4120 IH
by consumers to support their dispute 
1
claims by instead requiring them to pass 
2
all material onto furnishers and elimi-
3
nating CRA’s discretion to deem some dis-
4
putes frivolous or irrelevant when a con-
5
sumer resubmits a claim that they believe 
6
has been inadequately resolved; 
7
(iii) enhance educational content on 
8
CRAs’ websites to improve consumers’ un-
9
derstanding of the dispute process and to 
10
make it easier for all consumers to initiate 
11
claims, including by providing these disclo-
12
sures in other languages besides English; 
13
and 
14
(iv) create a new consumer right to 
15
appeal reviews by CRAs and furnishers of 
16
the initial disputes. 
17
(3) INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.— 
18
(A) Despite the fact that the FCRA cur-
19
rently provides implicit authority for injunctive 
20
relief, consumers have been prevented from ex-
21
ercising this right against CRAs. Legislation 
22
explicitly clarifying this right is intended to un-
23
derscore congressional intent that injunctive re-
24
18:18 Aug 27, 2021
H4120
17 
•HR 4120 IH
lief should be viewed as a remedy available to 
1
consumers. 
2
(B) Myriad findings by the courts, regu-
3
lators, consumers, and consumer advocates 
4
make clear that CRAs have failed to establish 
5
adequate standards for the accuracy and com-
6
pleteness of consumer reports, yet the nation-
7
wide CRAs have demonstrated little willingness 
8
to voluntarily retool their policies and proce-
9
dures to fix the problems. 
10
(C) Providing courts with explicit authority 
11
to issue injunctive relief, by telling the CRAs to 
12
remedy unlawful practices and procedures, 
13
would further CRAs’ mandate under the FCRA 
14
to assure the maximum possible accuracy and 
15
completeness of information contained on credit 
16
reports. 
17
(D) Absent explicit authority to issue in-
18
junctions, history suggests that the nationwide 
19
CRAs are likely to continue conducting business 
20
as usual in treating any monetary settlements 
21
with individual consumers and fines imposed by 
22
State attorneys general and Federal regulators, 
23
simply as the ‘‘cost of doing business’’. 
24
(4) CREDIT SCORES.— 
25
18:18 Aug 27, 2021
H4120
18 
•HR 4120 IH
(A) While nationwide CRAs are required 
1
by law to supply consumers with a free copy of 
2
their credit report annually, they can charge 
3
consumers to obtain a credit score disclosure. 
4
(B) Many consumers do not realize that 
5
they have more than just ‘‘one’’ credit score. 
6
Because the submission of credit information to 
7
CRAs is voluntary and not all furnishers submit 
8
information to every CRA, the information con-
9
tained in a report also varies among CRAs. As 
10
a result, the credit score generated by each 
11
CRA is also likely to vary, resulting in poten-
12
tially different credit decisions based on an 
13
evaluation of different credit reports obtained 
14
from different CRAs. 
15
(C) A February 2015 Consumer Bureau 
16
report titled ‘‘Consumer Voices on Credit Re-
17
ports and Scores’’ found that consumers had 
18
questions about what actions to take to improve 
19
their scores once they had seen them, sug-
20
gesting that additional disclosures and edu-
21
cational content would be helpful to consumers. 
22
The Consumer Bureau found that consumers 
23
were confused by conflicting advice on how to 
24
improve their scores.

(D) That report also noted that consumers 
1
found the process for obtaining consumer re-
2
ports and credit scores confusing. Consumers 
3
also were uncertain about whether, and under 
4
what circumstances, they could obtain a con-
5
sumer report for free.

(5) PRIVATE EDUCATION LOANS.— 
7
(A) The Consumer Bureau’s October 2014 
8
report titled ‘‘Annual Report of the CFPB Stu-
9
dent Loan Ombudsman’’ noted many private 
10
education loan borrowers, who sought to nego-
11
tiate a modified repayment plan when they were 
12
experiencing a period of financial distress, were 
13
unable to get assistance from their loan holders, 
14
which often resulting in them defaulting on 
15
their loans. This pattern resembles the dif-
16
ficulty that a significant number of mortgage 
17
loan borrowers experienced when they sought to 
18
take responsible steps to work with their mort-
19
gage loan servicer to avoid foreclosure during 
20
the Great Recession. 
21
(B) Although private student loan holders 
22
may allow a borrower to postpone payments 
23
while enrolled in school full-time, many limit 
24
this option to a certain time period, usually 48 
25
18:18 Aug 27, 2021
H4120
20 
•HR 4120 IH
to 66 months. This limited time period may not 
1
be sufficient for those who need additional time 
2
to obtain their degree or who want to continue 
3
their education by pursing a graduate or profes-
4
sional degree. The Consumer Bureau found 
5
that borrowers who were unable to make pay-
6
ments often defaulted or had their accounts 
7
sent to collections before they were even able to 
8
graduate.

(6) DECEPTIVE PRACTICES AT CERTAIN PRO-
10
PRIETARY EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS AND CAREER 
11
EDUCATION PROGRAMS.— 
12
(A) NCLC cited the proliferation of law 
13
enforcement actions against many for-profit 
14
schools in its June 2014 report, titled ‘‘Ensur-
15
ing Educational Integrity: 10 Steps to Improve 
16
State Oversight of For-profit Schools’’, to dem-
17
onstrate the pervasive problem in this sector of 
18
targeting low-income students with deceptive 
19
high-pressure sales techniques involving inflated 
20
job placement rates and misleading data on 
21
graduate wages, and false representations about 
22
the transferability of credits and the employ-
23
ability of graduates in occupations that require 
24
licensure. Student loan borrowers at these 
25
18:18 Aug 27, 2021
H4120
21 
•HR 4120 IH
schools may be left with nothing but worthless 
1
credentials and large debt. Those who default 
2
on their student loans face years with damaged 
3
credit that will adversely impact their ability to 
4
rent or buy homes, purchase cars, and find em-
5
ployment. 
6
(B) The closure and bankruptcy of Corin-
7
thian Colleges, which was found to have de-
8
ceived students by steering them into high-in-
9
terest student loans based on misleading grad-
10
uation rates and employment data, is a good 
11
example of the problem. Even after its closure, 
12
many Corinthian students remained saddled 
13
with student loan debt, worthless degrees, and 
14
few prospects for employment. 
15
(C) Attending a 2-year, for-profit college 
16
costs, on average, four times as much as at-
17
tending a community college. Students at for- 
18
profit colleges represent only about 11 percent 
19
of the total higher education population but a 
20
startling 44 percent of all Federal student loan 
21
defaults, according to the United States De-
22
partment of Education (‘‘DOE’’). 
23
(D) According to NCLC, a dispropor-
24
tionate number of for-profit students are low-in-
25
18:18 Aug 27, 2021
H4120
22 
•HR 4120 IH
come and people of color. These schools target 
1
veterans, working parents, first-generation stu-
2
dents, and non-English speaking students, who 
3
may be more likely than their public or private 
4
nonprofit school counterparts to drop out, incur 
5
enormous student debt, and default on this 
6
debt. In the 2011–2012 school year, 28 percent 
7
of African Americans and 15 percent of Latinos 
8
attending 4-year institutions were enrolled in a 
9
for-profit school, compared to 10 percent of 
10
Whites. 
11
(E) As highlighted in a press release titled 
12
‘‘Obama Administration Announces Final Rules 
13
to Protect Students from Poor-Performing Ca-
14
reer College Programs’’, that was issued by the 
15
DOE on October 30, 2014, ‘‘[t]oo often, stu-
16
dents at career colleges—including thousands of 
17
veterans—are charged excessive costs, but don’t 
18
get the education they paid for. Instead, stu-
19
dents in such programs are provided with poor 
20
quality training, often for low-wage jobs or in 
21
occupations where there are simply no job op-
22
portunities. They find themselves with large 
23
amounts of debt and, too often, end up in de-
24
fault. In many cases, students are drawn into

these programs with confusing or misleading in-
1
formation.’’. 
2
(7) MEDICAL DEBT.— 
3
(A) Research by the Consumer Bureau has 
4
found that the inclusion of medical collections 
5
on consumer reports has unfairly reduced con-
6
sumers’ credit scores. 
7
(B) The Consumer Bureau’s review of 5 
8
million anonymized credit files from September 
9
2011 to September 2013, for example, found 
10
that credit scores may underestimate a person’s 
11
creditworthiness by up to 10 points for those 
12
who owe medical debt, and may underestimate 
13
a person’s creditworthiness by up to 22 points 
14
after the medical debt has been paid. For con-
15
sumers with lower credit scores, especially those 
16
on the brink of what is considered subprime, a 
17
10 to 22 point decrease in their credit scores 
18
can have a significant impact on their lives, in-
19
cluding by affecting whether they are able to 
20
qualify for credit and, if so, the terms and con-
21
ditions under which it is extended to them. 
22
(C) The Consumer Bureau found that half 
23
of all collections trade lines that appear on con-
24
sumer reports are related to medical bills 
25
18:18 Aug 27, 2021
H4120
24 
•HR 4120 IH
claimed to be owed to hospitals and other med-
1
ical providers. These trade lines affect the re-
2
ports of nearly one-fifth of all consumers in the 
3
credit reporting system. 
4
(D) The Consumer Bureau has found that 
5
there are no objective or enforceable standards 
6
that determine when a debt can or should be 
7
reported as a collection trade line. Because debt 
8
buyers and collectors determine whether, when, 
9
and for how long to report a collection account, 
10
there is only a limited relationship between the 
11
time period reported, the severity of a delin-
12
quency, and when or whether a collection trade 
13
line appears on a consumer’s credit report. 
14
(E) Medical bills can be complex and con-
15
fusing for many consumers, which results in 
16
consumers’ uncertainty about what they owe, to 
17
whom, when, or for what, that may cause some 
18
people, who ordinarily pay their bills on time, to 
19
delay or withhold payments on their medical 
20
debts. This uncertainty can also result in med-
21
ical collections appearing on consumer reports. 
22
In a December 2014 report titled ‘‘Consumer 
23
Credit Reports: A Study of Medical and Non- 
24
Medical Collections’’, the Consumer Bureau 
25
18:18 Aug 27, 2021
H4120
25 
•HR 4120 IH
found that a large portion of consumers with 
1
medical collections show no other evidence of fi-
2
nancial distress and are consumers who ordi-
3
narily pay their other financial obligations on 
4
time. Unlike with most credit products or serv-
5
ices, such as credit cards, installment loans, 
6
utilities, or wireless or cable services that have 
7
contractual account disclosures describing the 
8
terms and conditions of use, most consumers 
9
are not told what their out-of-pocket medical 
10
costs will be in advance. Consumers needing ur-
11
gent or emergency care rarely know, or are pro-
12
vided, the cost of a medical treatment or proce-
13
dure before the service is rendered. 
14
(F) The Consumer Bureau concluded that 
15
the presence of medical collections is less pre-
16
dictive of future defaults or serious delin-
17
quencies than the presence of a nonmedical col-
18
lection in a study titled ‘‘Data Point: Medical 
19
Debt and Credit Scores’’, issued in May 2014. 
20
(G) FICO’s latest credit scoring model, 
21
‘‘FICO 9’’, changes the treatment of paid col-
22
lections to disregard any collection matters that 
23
the consumer has paid in full. FICO 9, how-
24
ever, is not yet widely used by lenders. 
25
18:18 Aug 27, 2021
H4120
26 
•HR 4120 IH
(H) VantageScore’s latest credit scoring 
1
model, ‘‘VantageScore 4.0’’, will be available in 
2
the fall of 2017. This model will penalize med-
3
ical collections less than non-medical ones. 
4
(I) The three nationwide CRAs entered 
5
into a settlement agreement with the New York 
6
State attorney general in 2015 to address defi-
7
ciencies in their dispute resolution process and 
8
enhance the accuracy of items on reports. These 
9
policy changes will be implemented in a three- 
10
phased rollout, culminating by June 2018. Sub-
11
sequently, these CRAs entered into a coopera-
12
tive agreement with 31 State Attorneys Gen-
13
eral, which was the basis of the creation of the 
14
National Consumer Assistance Plan (‘‘NCAP’’) 
15
to change some of their business practices. 
16
(J) While the CRAs appear to be volun-
17
tarily adopting policy changes on a nationwide 
18
basis, they are not obligated to do so for con-
19
sumers who reside in States that are not party 
20
to any of the consent orders. 
21
(K) As a result of the settlement agree-
22
ments, the three nationwide CRAs will set a 
23
180-day waiting period before including medical 
24
collections on a report and will remove a med-
25
18:18 Aug 27, 2021
H4120
27 
•HR 4120 IH
ical collection from a report once it is paid by 
1
an insurance company. While this change will 
2
benefit many, once a medical collection appears 
3
on a report, it will only be deleted or suppressed 
4
if it is found to have been the insurance com-
5
pany’s obligation to pay and the insurer pays it. 
6
Given the research showing there is little pre-
7
dictive value in medical debt information, med-
8
ical collections that are paid or settled should 
9
quickly be removed from a report, regardless of 
10
who pays or settles this debt. 
11
(8) FINANCIAL ABUSE BY KNOWN PERSONS.— 
12
(A) Financial abuse and exploitation are 
13
frequently associated with domestic violence. 
14
This type of abuse may result in fraudulent 
15
charges to a credit card or having fraudulent 
16
accounts created by the abuser in the survivor’s 
17
name that could affect ratings by CRAs. Finan-
18
cial abuse may also result in the survivor’s in-
19
ability to make timely payments on their valid 
20
obligations due to loss or changes in income 
21
that can occur when their abuser steals from or 
22
coerces the survivor to relinquish their pay-
23
checks or savings that could affect ratings by 
24
CRAs. 
25
18:18 Aug 27, 2021
H4120
28 
•HR 4120 IH
(B) By racking up substantial debts in the 
1
survivor’s name, abusers are able to exercise fi-
2
nancial control over their survivors to make it 
3
economically difficult for the survivor, whose 
4
credit is often destroyed, to escape the situa-
5
tion. 
6
(C) Domestic abuse survivors with poor 
7
credit are likely to face significant obstacles in 
8
establishing financial independence from their 
9
abusers. This can be due, in part, because con-
10
sumer reports may be used when a person at-
11
tempts to obtain a checking account, housing, 
12
insurance, utilities, employment, and even a se-
13
curity clearance as required for certain jobs. 
14
(D) Providing documentation of identity 
15
(‘‘ID’’) theft in order to dispute information on 
16
one’s consumer report can be particularly chal-
17
lenging for those who know their financial 
18
abuser. 
19
(E) While it is easier for consumers who 
20
obtain a police report to remove fraudulent in-
21
formation from their consumer report and pre-
22
vent it from reappearing in the future, accord-
23
ing to the Empire Justice Center, safety and 
24
other noncredit concerns may impact the capac-
25
18:18 Aug 27, 2021
H4120
29 
•HR 4120 IH
ity of a survivor of financial abuse committed 
1
by a known person to turn to law enforcement 
2
to get a police report. 
3
(F) According to the Legal Aid Society in 
4
New York, domestic abuse survivors, seeking to 
5
remove adverse information stemming from fi-
6
nancial abuse by contacting their furnishers di-
7
rectly, are likely to face skepticism about claims 
8
of ID theft perpetrated by a partner because of 
9
an assumption that they are aware of, and may 
10
have been complicit in, the activity which the 
11
survivor alleges stems from financial abuse. 
12
(9) DECEPTIVE AND MISLEADING MARKETING 
13
PRACTICES.— 
14
(A) The Consumer Bureau’s February 
15
2015 report titled ‘‘Consumer Voices on Credit 
16
Reports and Scores’’ found that some con-
17
sumers did not obtain a copy of their consumer 
18
report due to concerns about security or of 
19
being trapped into purchasing unwanted prod-
20
ucts like an additional report or a credit moni-
21
toring service. 
22
(B) In January 2017, the Consumer Bu-
23
reau fined TransUnion and Equifax for decep-
24
tively marketing credit scores for purchase by 
25
18:18 Aug 27, 2021
H4120
30 
•HR 4120 IH
consumers as the same credit scores typically 
1
used by lenders to determine creditworthiness 
2
and for luring consumers into costly subscrip-
3
tion services that were advertised as ‘‘free’’ or 
4
‘‘$1’’ that automatically charged recurring fees 
5
unless cancelled by consumers. The Consumer 
6
Bureau also found that Equifax was illegally 
7
advertising its products on web pages that con-
8
sumers 
accessed 
through 
9
AnnualCreditReport.com before consumers ob-
10
tained their free disclosures. Because of these 
11
troubling practices, TransUnion was ordered to 
12
pay $13.9 million in restitution to harmed con-
13
sumers and a civil penalty of $3 million to the 
14
Consumer Bureau. Equifax was ordered to pay 
15
more than $3.7 million to affected consumers 
16
as well as a civil money penalty of $2.5 million 
17
to the Consumer Bureau. As part of the con-
18
sent orders, the CRAs are also supposed to 
19
change the way that they sell their products to 
20
consumers. The CRAs must also obtain con-
21
sumers’ express consent before enrolling them 
22
into subscription services as well as make it 
23
easer for consumers to cancel these programs. 
24
18:18 Aug 27, 2021
H4120
31 
•HR 4120 IH
(C) The Consumer Bureau fined the other 
1
nationwide CRA—Experian—in March 2017 
2
for deceiving consumers about the use of credit 
3
scores that it marketed and sold to consumers 
4
as credit scores that were used by lenders and 
5
for illegally advertising its products on web 
6
pages 
that 
consumers 
accessed 
through 
7
AnnualCreditReport.com before they obtained 
8
their free annual disclosures. Experian was or-
9
dered to pay more than $3.7 million in restitu-
10
tion to harmed consumers and a civil monetary 
11
penalty of $2.5 million to the Consumer Bu-
12
reau. 
13
(D) The Consumer Bureau’s January and 
14
March 2017 consent orders with the three na-
15
tionwide CRAs show that these CRAs have en-
16
ticed consumers into purchasing products and 
17
services that they may not want or need, in 
18
some instances by advertising products or serv-
19
ices ‘‘free’’ that automatically converted into an 
20
ongoing subscription service at the regular price 
21
unless cancelled by the consumer. Although 
22
these CRAs must now change their deceptive 
23
marketing practices, codifying these duties is an 
24
18:18 Aug 27, 2021
H4120
32 
•HR 4120 IH
appropriate way to ensure that these companies 
1
never revert back to such misleading tactics. 
2
(E) Given the ubiquitous use of consumer 
3
reports in consumers’ lives and the fact that 
4
consumers’ participation in the credit reporting 
5
system is involuntary, CRAs should also 
6
prioritize providing consumers with the effective 
7
means to safeguard their personal and financial 
8
information and improve their credit standing, 
9
rather than seeking to exploit consumers’ con-
10
cerns and confusion about credit reporting and 
11
scoring, to boost their companies’ profits. 
12
(F) Vulnerable consumers, who have legiti-
13
mate concerns about the security of their per-
14
sonal and financial information, deserve clear, 
15
accurate, and transparent information about 
16
the credit reporting tools that may be available 
17
to them, such as fraud alerts and freezes. 
18
(10) CLARITY IN CREDIT SCORING.— 
19
(A) The February 2015 report of the Bu-
20
reau of Consumer Financial Protection titled 
21
‘‘Consumer Voices on Credit Reports and 
22
Scores’’ found that some consumers are reluc-
23
tant to comparison shop for loans and other 
24
types of consumer credit products out of fear 
25
18:18 Aug 27, 2021
H4120
33 
•HR 4120 IH
that they will lower their credit scores by doing 
1
so. 
2
(B) The Consumer Bureau found that one 
3
of the most common barriers for people in re-
4
viewing their own credit reports and shopping 
5
for the best credit terms was a lack of under-
6
standing of the differences between ‘‘soft’’ and 
7
‘‘hard’’ inquiries and whether requesting a copy 
8
of their own report would adversely impact their 
9
credit standing. 
10
(C) The Bureau of Consumer Financial 
11
Protection revealed that consumers with accu-
12
rate perceptions of their creditworthiness may 
13
be better equipped to shop for favorable credit 
14
terms. 
15
(11) CREDIT CHECKS AND EMPLOYMENT DECI-
16
SIONS.— 
17
(A) The use of consumer reports as a fac-
18
tor in making hiring decisions has been found 
19
to be prevalent in a diverse array of occupa-
20
tions, and is not limited to certain high-level 
21
management or executive positions. 
22
(B) According to the California Labor 
23
Federation, only 25 percent of employers re-
24
searched the credit history of job applicants in 
25
18:18 Aug 27, 2021
H4120
34 
•HR 4120 IH
1998. However, this practice had increased to 
1
43 percent by 2006 and to 60 percent by 2011. 
2
(C) A study titled ‘‘Do Job Applicant 
3
Credit Histories Predict Job Performance Ap-
4
praisal Ratings or Termination Decisions?’’, 
5
published in 2012, found that, while credit his-
6
tory might conceptually measure a person’s 
7
level of responsibility, ability to meet deadlines, 
8
dependability, or integrity, it does not, in prac-
9
tice, actually predict an employee’s performance 
10
or likelihood to quit. Credit reports contain 
11
many inaccuracies and credit history can be 
12
contaminated by events that are sometimes out-
13
side a person’s control, such as a sudden med-
14
ical expense after an accident or the loss of a 
15
job during an economic downturn. The study 
16
found that there is no benefit from using credit 
17
history to predict job performance or turnover. 
18
(D) Despite the absence of data showing a 
19
correlation between job performance and credit- 
20
worthiness, employers continue to use credit 
21
checks as a proxy for assessing character and 
22
integrity. According to a 2012 Society for 
23
Human Resource Management survey, organi-
24
zations indicated that they used credit checks 
25
18:18 Aug 27, 2021
H4120
35 
•HR 4120 IH
on job candidates primarily to reduce or prevent 
1
theft and embezzlement and to minimize legal 
2
liability for negligent hiring. 
3
(E) The use of credit checks for employ-
4
ment purposes creates a true ‘‘catch-22’’ for 
5
unemployed people with impaired credit. For 
6
example, the financial hardship caused by losing 
7
a job may cause some unemployed individuals 
8
to make late or partial payments on their bills, 
9
but their poor credit standing caused by this 
10
negative information on their consumer report 
11
can also impede their chances of obtaining a 
12
new job to end their financial distress. 
13
(F) A September 2014 report by the New 
14
York City Council’s Committee on Civil Rights 
15
noted that, for those who have been unemployed 
16
for an extended period of time and whose credit 
17
has suffered as they fell behind on bills, the use 
18
of credit reports in the hiring process can exac-
19
erbate and perpetuate an already precarious sit-
20
uation. 
21
(G) In a March 2013 Demos report titled 
22
‘‘Discredited: How Employment Credit Checks 
23
Keep Out Qualified Workers Out of a Job’’, one 
24
in four survey participants who were unem-
25
18:18 Aug 27, 2021
H4120
36 
•HR 4120 IH
ployed said that a potential employer had re-
1
quested to check their credit report as part of 
2
a job application. Among job applicants with 
3
blemished credit histories in the survey, one in 
4
seven had been told that they were not being 
5
hired because of their credit history. 
6
(H) While job applicants must give prior 
7
approval for a prospective employer to pull their 
8
credit reports under the FCRA, this authoriza-
9
tion, as a practical matter, does not constitute 
10
an effective consumer protection because an 
11
employer may reject any job applicant who re-
12
fuses a credit check. 
13
(I) Some negative information on a report 
14
may stem from uncontrollable circumstances, or 
15
significant life events in a consumer’s life, such 
16
as a medical crisis or a divorce. Demos found 
17
that poor credit is associated with household 
18
unemployment, lack of health coverage, and 
19
medical debt, which are factors that reflect eco-
20

people experienced a 20-point drop in their 
1
credit scores and about 21 million saw their 
2
scores decline by more than 50 points. While 
3
the Great Recession reduced many consumers’ 
4
credit scores due to foreclosures and other fi-
5
nancial hardships, the financial crisis had a 
6
particularly harsh impact on African Americans 
7
and Latinos, as racial and ethnic minorities and 
8
communities of color were frequently targeted 
9
by predatory mortgage lenders who steered bor-
10
rowers into high-cost subprime loans, even when 
11
these borrowers would have qualified for less 
12
costly prime credit. 
13
(K) A May 2006 Brookings Institution re-
14
port titled ‘‘Credit Scores, Reports, and Getting 
15
Ahead in America’’ found that counties with a 
16
relatively higher proportion of racial and ethnic 
17
minorities in the United States tended to have 
18
lower credit scores compared with counties that 
19
had a lower concentration of communities of 
20
color. 
21
(L) Studies have consistently found that 
22
African American and Latino households tend, 
23
on average, to have lower credit scores than 
24
White households. The growing use of credit

checks, therefore, may disproportionately screen 
1
otherwise qualified racial and ethnic minorities 
2
out of jobs, leading to discriminatory hiring 
3
practices, and further exacerbating the trend 
4
where unemployment for African American and 
5
Latino communities is elevated well above the 
6
rate of Whites. 
7
(M) A 2012 Demos survey found that 65 
8
percent of White respondents reported having 
9
good or excellent credit scores while over half of 
10
African American households reported only hav-
11
ing fair or bad credit.

(12) PROTECTIONS
FOR
CONSUMERS’ CREDIT 
13
INFORMATION.— 
14
(A) Despite heightened awareness, inci-
15
dents of ID theft continue to rise. In February 
16
2015, the Federal Government reported that ID 
17
theft was the top consumer complaint that it 
18
received for the 15th consecutive year. As these 
19
incidents increase, consumers experience signifi-
20
cant financial loss and emotional distress from 
21
the inability to safeguard effectively and inex-
22
pensively their credit information from bad ac-
23
tors. 
24

H4120

•HR 4120 IH
(B) According to a Carnegie Mellon study, 
1
children are 50 times more likely than adults to 
2
have their identities stolen. Child identities are 
3
valuable to thieves because most children do not 
4
have existing files, and their parents may not 
5
notice fraudulent activity until their child ap-
6
plies for a student loan, a job, or a credit card. 
7
As a result, the fraudulent activity of the bad 
8
actors may go undetected for years. 
9
(C) Despite the increasing incidents of 
10
children’s ID theft, parents who want to 
11
proactively prevent their children from having 
12
their identity stolen, may not be able to do so. 
13
Only one of the three nationwide CRAs cur-
14
rently allows parents from any State to set up 
15
a freeze for a minor child. At the other two na-
16
tionwide CRAs, parents can only obtain a freeze 
17
after a child has become an ID theft victim be-
18
cause, it is only at this point, that these CRAs 
19
have an existing credit file for the child. While 
20
many States have enacted laws to address this 
21
problem, there is no existing Federal law. 
22
(D) According to Javelin Strategy & 
23
Research’s 2015 Identity Fraud study, $16 bil-
24
lion was stolen by fraudsters from 12.7 million 
25
18:18 Aug 27, 2021
H4120
40 
•HR 4120 IH
American consumers in 2014. Similarly, the 
1
United States Department of Justice found an 
2
estimated 7 percent of all residents age 16 or 
3
older (about 17.6 million persons) in this coun-
4
try were victims of one or more incidents of ID 
5
theft in 2014, and the number of elderly victims 
6
age 65 or older (about 86 percent) increased 
7
from 2.1 million in 2012 to 2.6 million in 2014. 
8
(E) Consumers frequently express concern 
9
about the security of their financial informa-
10
tion. According to a 2015 MasterCard survey, 
11
a majority of consumers (77 percent) have anx-
12
iety about the possibility that their financial in-
13
formation and Social Security numbers may be 
14
stolen or compromised, with about 55 percent 
15
of consumers indicating that they would rather 
16
have naked pictures of themselves leaked online 
17
than have their financial information stolen. 
18
(F) That survey also revealed that con-
19
sumers’ fears about the online security of their 
20
financial information even outweighed con-
21
sumers’ worries about other physical security 
22
dangers such as having their houses robbed (59 
23
percent) or being pickpocketed (46 percent).

(G) According to Consumer Reports, 
1
roughly 50 million American consumers spent 
2
about $3.5 billion in 2010 to purchase products 
3
aimed at protecting their identity, with the an-
4
nual cost of these services ranging from $120 
5
to $300. As risks to consumers’ personal and fi-
6
nancial information continue to grow, con-
7
sumers need additional protections to ensure 
8
that they have fair and reasonable access to the 
9
full suite of ID theft and fraud prevention 
10
measures that may be right for them.
