RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the significance of ‘‘Asian/Pacific American Her-
itage Month’’ in May as an important time to celebrate 
the significant contributions of Asian Americans, Native 
Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders to the history of the 
United States. 
Whereas the people of the United States join together each 
May to pay tribute to the contributions of generations of 
Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Island-
ers who have enriched the history of the United States;

Whereas the history of Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, 
and Pacific Islanders in the United States is inextricably 
tied to the story of the United States; 
Whereas the Asian-American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific 
Islander community is an inherently diverse population, 
comprised of over 45 distinct ethnicities and over 100 
language dialects; 
Whereas, according to the United States Census Bureau, the 
Asian-American population grew faster than any other 
racial or ethnic group over the last decade, surging 55.5 
percent between 2010 and 2020, and during that same 
time period, the Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander 
population grew by 30.8 percent; 
Whereas there are approximately 24,000,000 residents of the 
United States who identify as Asian and approximately 
1,600,000 residents of the United States who identify as 
Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, making up over 7 
percent of the total United States population; 
Whereas the month of May was selected for ‘‘Asian/Pacific 
American Heritage Month’’ because the first Japanese 
immigrants arrived in the United States on May 7, 1843, 
and the first transcontinental railroad was completed on 
May 10, 1869, with substantial contributions from Chi-
nese immigrants; 
Whereas section 102 of title 36, United States Code, officially 
designates May as ‘‘Asian/Pacific American Heritage 
Month’’ and requests the President to issue an annual 
proclamation calling on the people of the United States 
to observe the month with appropriate programs, cere-
monies, and activities;

Whereas 2022 marks several important milestones for the 
Asian-American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander 
community, including— 
(1) the 140th anniversary of the passage of the Chi-
nese Exclusion Act of 1882, which barred the entry of 
Chinese immigrants to the United States for more than 
half a century and spurred a series of anti-immigrant 
policies targeting immigration from the Asia-Pacific re-
gion; 
(2) the 40th anniversary of the murder of Vincent 
Chin, a Chinese-American man beaten to death in Michi-
gan by two White men angered by layoffs in the auto in-
dustry;

which designated the month of May as ‘‘Asian/Pacific 
American Heritage Month’’; and 
(4) the 10th anniversary of the creation of the Asian 
American and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving 
Institutions program, which was authorized under the 
College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007; 
Whereas Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Is-
landers have made significant contributions to the United 
States at all levels of the Federal Government and the 
United States Armed Forces, including— 
(1) Daniel K. Inouye, a Medal of Honor and Presi-
dential Medal of Freedom recipient who, as President pro 
tempore of the Senate, was the highest ranking Asian- 
American government official in the history of the United 
States; 
(2) Dalip Singh Saund, the first Asian-American 
Congressman; 
(3) Patsy T. Mink, the first woman of color and 
Asian-American woman to be elected to Congress;

(4) Hiram L. Fong, the first Asian-American Sen-
ator; 
(5) Daniel K. Akaka, the first Senator of Native 
Hawaiian ancestry; 
(6) Norman Y. Mineta, the first Asian-American 
member of a Presidential Cabinet; 
(7) Elaine L. Chao, the first Asian-American woman 
member of a Presidential Cabinet; and 
(8) Kamala Devi Harris, the first Asian-American 
Vice President of the United States; 
Whereas the 117th Congress includes a record 21 Members 
of Asian or Pacific Islander descent; 
Whereas, in 2022, the Congressional Asian Pacific American 
Caucus, a bicameral caucus of Members of Congress ad-
vocating on behalf of Asian Americans, Native Hawai-
ians, and Pacific Islanders, is composed of 76 members; 
Whereas, in 2022, Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and 
Pacific Islanders are serving in State and Territorial leg-
islatures across the United States in record numbers, in-
cluding in— 
(1) the States of Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Cali-
fornia, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illi-
nois, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michi-
gan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New 
Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North 
Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Ten-
nessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, 
Wisconsin, and Wyoming; and

Whereas, in 2022, Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and 
Pacific Islanders honorably serve at all levels of the Fed-
eral judiciary; 
Whereas, since March 2020, there has been a dramatic in-
crease in reports of anti-Asian hate crimes and incidents 
related to the COVID–19 pandemic, and in that time pe-
riod— 
(1) there has been a 339-percent increase in anti- 
Asian hate crimes in 2021, and a 124-percent increase in 
2020; 
(2) there have been over 11,000 hate incidents that 
have been reported since the start of the pandemic, ac-
cording to Stop AAPI Hate, and countless others that 
have not been reported; 
(3) in the Atlanta, Georgia, region on March 16, 
2021, 8 people were murdered, including 6 Asian women, 
at 3 separate Asian-owned businesses; and 
(4) 1 in 5 Asian Americans (21.2 percent) and Pa-
cific Islanders (20.0 percent) reported experiencing a 
hate incident in 2021, according to Stop AAPI Hate; 
Whereas discrimination targeting Asian Americans, especially 
in moments of crisis, is not a new phenomenon and has 
occurred throughout United States history, including— 
(1) the Page Act of 1875, which prohibited Chinese- 
American women from immigrating to the United States; 
(2) the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which was 
the first law to explicitly name an entire ethnic group for 
exclusion from immigrating to the United States; 
(3) the signing of Executive Order 9066 in 1942, 
which authorized the relocation and incarceration of ap-
proximately 120,000 individuals of Japanese ancestry

during World War II, the majority of whom were United 
States citizens; 
(4) the murder of Vincent Chin in 1982 by two 
White autoworkers who mistakenly believed that Chin 
was Japanese and blamed him for the loss of their jobs 
due to the rise of the Japanese automotive industry; 
(5) the Cleveland Elementary School shooting on 
January 17, 1989, where a gunman used an AK–47 to 
kill 5 children, 4 of whom were of Southeast Asian de-
scent; 
(6) the rise in discrimination and violence against 
Muslim, Sikh, and South Asian Americans following the 
September 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center 
and the Pentagon; and 
(7) the mass shooting at a Sikh temple in Oak 
Creek, Wisconsin, on August 5, 2012, where a White su-
premacist fatally shot 6 people and wounded 4 others; 
Whereas, in response to the uptick in anti-Asian hate crimes 
throughout the COVID–19 pandemic, Congress passed 
the COVID–19 Hate Crimes Act (Public Law 117–13), 
which was signed into law by President Joseph R. Biden 
on May 20, 2021; 
Whereas there remains much to be done to ensure that Asian 
Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders have 
access to resources and a voice in the government of the 
United States and continue to advance in the political 
landscape of the United States; and 
Whereas 
celebrating 
‘‘Asian/Pacific 
American 
Heritage 
Month’’ provides the people of the United States with an 
opportunity to recognize the achievements, contributions, 
and history of, and to understand the challenges faced
