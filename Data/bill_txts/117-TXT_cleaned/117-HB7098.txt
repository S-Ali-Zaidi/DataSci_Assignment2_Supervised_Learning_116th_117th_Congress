A BILL 
To amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act 
to expand the Magnet Schools Assistance Program. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Magnet schools Acces-

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 7098 IH
(1) Studies have found that the academic bene-
1
fits of attending integrated schools for students of 
2
color include— 
3
(A) higher achievement in mathematics, 
4
science, language, and reading; 
5
(B) school climates supportive of learning 
6
and studying; 
7
(C) increased likelihood of graduating from 
8
high school and entering and graduating from 
9
college; 
10
(D) higher income and educational attain-
11
ment; and 
12
(E) increased access to highly qualified 
13
teachers and leaders who are less likely to 
14
transfer to other schools. 
15
(2) The benefits of integrated schools extend to 
16
all students regardless of race or socioeconomic 
17
background. 
On 
average, 
students 
in 
18
socioeconomically and racially diverse schools have 
19
stronger academic outcomes than students in schools 
20
with concentrated poverty. Students in diverse 
21
schools have higher test scores, are more likely to 
22
enroll in college, and are less likely to drop out. Inte-
23
grated schools help reduce racial bias and counter 
24
stereotypes, as well as foster friendships across di-

verse groups, improve students’ satisfaction and self- 
1
confidence, and enhance leadership skills. 
2
(3) Students of color attending schools that are 
3
highly segregated by race and poverty are deprived 
4
of the benefits of integrated education. These 
5
schools are characterized by resource inequities that 
6
translate into large proportions of inexperienced and 
7
underprepared educators and a lack of rigorous 
8
coursework, which have negative consequences for 
9
students’ academic outcomes as measured by per-
10
formance on standardized achievement tests and 
11
high school graduation rates. 
12
(4) A 2019 study of every school district in the 
13
United States found that higher racial segregation 
14
contributes to a greater magnitude of achievement 
15
gaps in 3rd grade, and increases the rate at which 
16
gaps grow from 3rd to 8th grade, for students of 
17
color. 
18
(5) A 2016 Government Accountability Office 
19
analysis found that a growing percentage of public 
20
elementary schools and secondary schools in the Na-
21
tion are hypersegregated, with 90 percent or more 
22
Black and Latino student populations and students 
23
from low-income families. 
24
16:46 Mar 21, 2022
H7098

•HR 7098 IH
(6) A study reviewing 8 years of data from all 
1
United States school districts found that racial seg-
2
regation appears to undermine achievement, in part, 
3
because it concentrates minority students in high- 
4
poverty schools, which are, on average, less effective 
5
than lower-poverty schools and tend to be under- 
6
resourced. 
7
(7) Research shows that students’ exposure to 
8
other students from different backgrounds and the 
9
new ideas and opportunities that such exposure 
10
brings leads to improved critical thinking and prob-
11
lem-solving skills. Other benefits of attending diverse 
12
schools include increased civic participation in a di-
13
verse global economy and increased likelihood of liv-
14
ing in integrated neighborhoods and holding jobs in 
15
integrated workplaces as adults. 
16
(8) Magnet schools have been effective in pro-
17
moting school diversity, especially when district de-
18
mographics along with magnet school design, struc-
19
ture, and focus (particularly the centering of school 
20
integration in the school mission and the design for 
21
family outreach) are a priority.
