SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds that— 
2
(1) the population of western monarch butter-
3
flies is at imminent risk of extinction; 
4
(2) over the past 3 decades, the population of 
5
western monarch butterflies has declined by more 
6
than 99 percent due to prolonged drought, loss of 
7
milkweed and native pollinator habitat, loss of breed-
8
ing and overwintering habitat, and climate change; 
9
(3) in 2020, the population of western monarch 
10
butterflies reached a new historic low of 1,914 but-
11
terflies, falling below the predicted extinction thresh-
12
old for the third year in a row; 
13
(4) the extinction of the population of migra-
14
tory western monarch butterflies is now likely to 
15
occur within the next 2 decades if urgent action is 
16
not taken; 
17
(5) actively restoring native milkweed and nec-
18
tar plants, monarch overwintering habitat, and other 
19
pollinator habitat, and ensuring that key habitats 
20
are protected from destruction, are critical to ensur-
21
ing the survival of western monarch butterflies and 
22
can also help facilitate conservation of other essen-
23
tial pollinators; and

1
in improved pollination services for neighboring land, 
2
including agriculture and wildlife ecosystems.
