RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the 47th anniversary of Black April and the 
Fall of Saigon on April 30, 1975. 
Whereas since 1975, hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese

communities across the United States which contribute to 
the rich diversity of the Nation; 
Whereas, on April 30, 1975, the Republic of Vietnam was 
overthrown by communist forces in an event known as 
‘‘Black April’’ or the ‘‘Fall of Saigon’’, which is observed 
in Vietnamese-American communities across the United 
States each year;

Whereas members of the South Vietnamese military fought 
side by side with the United States Armed Forces in de-
fense of the ideals of democracy and freedom; 
Whereas Vietnamese Americans have continuously advocated 
for freedom and democracy in Vietnam, and spoken out 
against human rights abuses by the Vietnamese Govern-
ment; and

dom, obstructing press freedom, restricting its own citi-
zens’ freedom of speech and assembly, and detaining 
prisoners of conscience: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
