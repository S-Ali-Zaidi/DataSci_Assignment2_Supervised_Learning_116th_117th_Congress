Whereas ALS occurs throughout the world with no racial, 
ethnic, gender, or socioeconomic boundaries; 
Whereas ALS may affect any individual in any location; 
Whereas the cause of ALS is unknown in up to 90 percent 
of cases; 
Whereas approximately 10 percent of cases have a strong 
known genetic driver; 
Whereas on average, the period between the date on which 
an individual first experiences symptoms of ALS and the 
date on which the individual is diagnosed with ALS is 
more than 1 year; 
Whereas the onset of ALS often involves muscle weakness or 
stiffness, and the progression of ALS results in the fur-
ther weakening, wasting, and paralysis of— 
(1) the muscles of the limbs and trunk; and 
(2) the muscles that control vital functions, such as 
speech, swallowing, and breathing; 
Whereas ALS can strike individuals of any age but predomi-
nantly strikes adults; 
Whereas it is estimated that tens of thousands of individuals 
in the United States have ALS at any given time; 
Whereas based on studies of the population of the United 
States, slightly more than 5,600 individuals in the United 
States are diagnosed with ALS each year, and 15 individ-
uals in the United States are diagnosed with ALS each 
day; 
Whereas, between 2015 and 2040, the number of ALS cases 
around the world is expected to increase nearly 70 per-
cent;

•HRES 434 IH 
Whereas the majority of individuals with ALS die of res-
piratory failure; 
Whereas military veterans may be up to twice as likely to be 
diagnosed with ALS than the general public in the 
United States; 
Whereas as of the date of introduction of this resolution, 
there is no cure for ALS; 
Whereas the spouses, children, and family members of indi-
viduals living with ALS provide support to those individ-
uals with love, day-to-day care, and more; and 
Whereas an individual with ALS, and the caregivers of such 
an individual, can be required to bear significant costs 
for medical care, equipment, and home care services for 
the individual as the disease progresses: Now, therefore, 
be it
