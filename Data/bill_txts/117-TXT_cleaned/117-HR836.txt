RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the designation of December 3, 2021, 
as the ‘‘National Day of 3D Printing’’. 
Whereas additive manufacturing, also known as 3D printing, 
is a process by which digital 3D design data is used to 
build up a component in layers by depositing material; 
Whereas 3D printing creates an object layer by layer, greatly 
reducing waste and increasing efficiency compared to tra-
ditional manufacturing techniques; 
Whereas 3D printing has grown exponentially over the last 
several years; 
Whereas the United States is a world leader in advanced 
manufacturing, and has a history of design innovation;

Whereas public-private partnerships that promote advanced 
manufacturing, such as America Makes, Manufacturing x 
Digital, and other Manufacturing USA institutes, will de-
velop enhanced digital capabilities to design and test new 
products and reduce costs in manufacturing processes 
across a variety of industries; 
Whereas 3D printing has widespread applications in home 
construction, home goods production, biotechnology, the 
automotive sector, aerospace, medicine, consumer elec-
tronics, and defense; 
Whereas 3D printing has the potential to reshape manufac-
turing in the United States, by decreasing the cost of 
producing goods for small businesses and local manufac-
turers; 
Whereas innovation will be increased, as 3D printing reduces 
the time required for product development and market 
launch; and 
Whereas December 3, 2021, would be an appropriate date to 
designate as the ‘‘National Day of 3D Printing’’: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the designation of the ‘‘National 
2
Day of 3D Printing’’; 
3
(2) recognizes the economic impact of 3D print-
4
ing and the positive implications of 3D printing for 
5
the United States advanced manufacturing sector;
