RESOLUTION 
Supporting the continued work of the United States African 
Development Foundation as it creates pathways to pros-
perity for underserved communities on the African Con-
tinent through community-led development. 
Whereas the African Development Foundation Act (22 
U.S.C. 290h et seq.) established the United States Afri-
can Development Foundation (referred to in this pre-
amble as the ‘‘USADF’’) as an independent Federal 
agency with the goal to— 
(1) strengthen the bonds of partnership and under-
standing between the people of the countries of Africa 
and the United States;

(2) support local capacity building to create commu-
nity development opportunities and expand the participa-
tion of the countries of Africa in their development proc-
ess; and 
(3) foster the establishment and growth of indige-
nous development institutions that are equipped to re-
spond to local needs; 
Whereas, for 40 years, the USADF has invested in a pan- 
African network of local implementing partners that em-
ploy a community-led development approach to support 
African-designed and African-delivered solutions; 
Whereas the USADF has provided more than 3,400 grass-
roots and community enterprise grants in more than 40 
sub-Saharan African countries; 
Whereas the USADF strengthens food security, empowers 
smallholder farmers, and creates economic growth in 
rural, hard-to-reach communities by investing primarily 
in agricultural enterprises to increase access to larger 
markets for those rural communities and enhance the 
business management skills, production, distribution, and 
marketing capabilities of those rural communities; 
Whereas the USADF has maintained a strong emphasis on 
women and women entrepreneurs, and women represent 
up to 65 percent of the direct beneficiaries of grants from 
the USADF; 
Whereas, on February 20, 2020, the USADF partnered with 
the Academy for Women Entrepreneurs (AWE) of the 
Department of State to provide seed funding to grad-
uates of the AWE to advance the global economic em-
powerment of women;

Whereas, in fiscal year 2020, the USADF awarded 35 AWE 
grants in 8 countries to help African women break down 
barriers they disproportionally face in accessing capital, 
markets, networks, and mentorship so they can succeed 
as entrepreneurs; 
Whereas the USADF prioritizes partnerships with youth and 
supports nearly 300 social enterprises of Young African 
Leaders Initiative fellows and alumni of that initiative in 
37 sub-Saharan African countries by providing seed cap-
ital, technical assistance, and skills training to help 
young entrepreneurs create businesses that generate new 
jobs and incomes for thousands of young Africans; 
Whereas the work of the USADF in the off-grid energy sec-
tor, which is authorized under the Electrify Africa Act of 
2015 (22 U.S.C. 2293 note), has helped bring renewable 
energy solutions to communities with limited or no con-
nections to national power grids and improve energy ac-
cess for nearly 370,000 individuals in 15 sub-Saharan 
African countries; 
Whereas the USADF’s model of using 100-percent African 
staff and implementing partners based on the African 
Continent gives the USADF the ability to work in fragile 
and conflict-affected areas such as in the Great Lakes, 
Horn, and Sahel regions of Africa, and elsewhere; 
Whereas the small size of the USADF and the use of local 
implementing partners by the USADF has allowed the 
USADF to be ranked as one of the most efficient pro-
viders of foreign aid by the Center for Global Develop-
ment; 
Whereas the partnerships of the USADF with agencies of the 
Federal Government, including the Department of State,

•HRES 496 IH 
the Millennium Challenge Corporation, and the United 
States Agency for International Development, along with 
the alignment of the USADF with the priorities of Con-
gress, have allowed the USADF to extend the reach of 
critical development initiatives of the United States, such 
as initiatives authorized by the Global Food Security Act 
of 2016 (22 U.S.C. 9301 et seq.), the Electrify Africa 
Act of 2015 (22 U.S.C. 2293 note), and the African 
Growth and Opportunity Act and Millennium Challenge 
Act Modernization Act (Public Law 115–167; 132 Stat. 
1276); 
Whereas the partnerships between the USADF and private 
sector corporations and foundations, as well as African 
national and subnational governments, have allowed the 
USADF to extend its reach and development impact in 
addressing food insecurity, insufficient access to energy, 
and unemployment through youth and women entrepre-
neurship and job skills training and placement in Africa, 
while leveraging funding to help the dollars of taxpayers 
in the United States go further; and 
Whereas investments made by the USADF have developed 
and strengthened an extensive network of grassroots en-
terprises and social enterprises that are positively dis-
posed to the United States and are better positioned to 
partner with other Federal agencies and public and pri-
vate funders: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the continued work of the United

States African Development Foundation as it creates
