(3) the proliferation and threat of use of nuclear 
weapons and materials; 
(4) human rights violations; 
(5) corruption, conflict, and violence; 
(6) authoritarianism and distrust in democratic in-
stitutions undermined by disinformation; 
(7) gender, economic, and social inequality; and 
(8) transnational White supremacist violence and 
racist nationalism; 
Whereas such national security challenges are highlighted by 
the facts that— 
(1) a year and a half after the World Health Orga-
nization declared COVID–19 a global pandemic, just 
3.07 percent of people in low-income countries had re-
ceived 1 or more doses of a vaccine while 60.18 percent 
of people in wealthy countries had; 
(2) in 2020, natural disasters, worsened by climate 
change, displaced more than 30,700,000 people from 
their homes; 
(3) the United Nations estimates that about 10 per-
cent of people suffer from hunger worldwide; 
(4) the total amount authorized to be appropriated 
by the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 
2021 is $740,500,000,000; 
(5) 9 countries hold more than 13,000 nuclear war-
heads and military stockpiles worldwide are on the rise; 
and 
(6) about 900,000 military personnel, contractors, 
opposition combatants, humanitarian aid workers, jour-
nalists, national and military police, and other civilians 
have been killed in United States wars in Iraq, Afghani-
stan, Syria, Pakistan, and other major war zones since 
2001;

Whereas these challenges cannot be primarily solved through 
the use of military force or Department of Defense budg-
et increases; and 
Whereas refocusing United States national security strategy 
on these issues requires robust new investments in non-
military tools of statecraft, as well as domestic and inter-
national institutions that rely on dialogue, inclusivity, ac-
countability, conflict resolution, and global cooperation 
over competition: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That— 
1
(1) it should be the policy of the United 
2
States—

14
(F) ending the use of broad-based, sectoral
