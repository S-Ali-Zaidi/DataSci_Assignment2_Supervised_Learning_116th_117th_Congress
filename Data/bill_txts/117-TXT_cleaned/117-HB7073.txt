SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Maternal mental health conditions are the 
3
most common complications of pregnancy and child-
4
birth, affecting 1 in 5 women or 800,000 women an-
5
nually, during pregnancy or the year following preg-
6
nancy. 
7
(2) Maternal mental health and substance use 
8
disorders contribute to the high rate of maternal 
9
mortality in the United States, with suicide and 
10
drug overdose combined being the leading cause of 
11
death for women in the first year following preg-
12
nancy. 
13
(3) Women who experience racial and economic 
14
inequities are 3 to 4 times more likely to be im-
15
pacted by maternal mental health and other behav-
16
ioral health disorders. 
17
(4) Untreated maternal mental health condi-
18
tions and substance use disorders can have long- 
19
term negative impacts on the mother, baby, family, 
20
and society. 
21
(5) Mothers with untreated mental health con-
22
ditions during pregnancy are more likely to have 
23
poor nutrition and struggle with substance use dis-
24
orders, which can lead to poor birth outcomes for 
25
the baby.

•HR 7073 IH
(6) Untreated maternal mental health condi-
1
tions and substance use disorders can contribute 
2
to— 
3
(A) impaired parent-child interactions; 
4
(B) behavioral, cognitive, or emotional 
5
delays in the child; and 
6
(C) adverse childhood experiences that can 
7
negatively impact the child’s life. 
8
(7) Untreated maternal mental health condi-
9
tions are estimated to cost the United States econ-
10
omy $14,000,000,000 or $32,000 per mother-infant 
11
pair every year in addressing poor health outcomes 
12
and accounting for lost wages and productivity of 
13
the mother. 
14
(8) Although the United States Preventive 
15
Services Task Force and several national medical or-
16
ganizations encourage health care providers to 
17
screen and treat maternal mental health conditions, 
18
75 percent of women impacted remain untreated. 
19
(9) Frontline providers who care for women 
20
during pregnancy and the first year following preg-
21
nancy are often reluctant to screen for maternal 
22
mental health conditions, citing lack of education, 
23
insurance reimbursement, and resources for affected 
24
women.
