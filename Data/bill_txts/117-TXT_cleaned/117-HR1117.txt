RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the designation of 2022 as the ‘‘Year 
of the Parents’’. 
Whereas the right of parents to protect their children and to 
direct their education and moral development has been 
repeatedly infringed by the courts, by Federal regula-
tions, and by misguided policy initiatives; 
Whereas parents have a right to know and have a say in 
what their children are being taught in the classroom; 
Whereas the liberty of parents to direct the upbringing, edu-
cation, and care of their children is a fundamental right; 
Whereas each child is an individual with unique educational 
needs and gifts; 
Whereas parents are best positioned to know what is in his 
or her child’s best interest, not the government;

Whereas providing a first-rate education for America’s chil-
dren is one of our greatest responsibilities; 
Whereas there are countless dedicated teachers and adminis-
trators who work hard every day and serve students well; 
Whereas ensuring all students receive the proper support and 
access to a quality education requires a partnership be-
tween parents, local school boards, and States; 
Whereas at-home virtual learning puts much additional strain 
on parents, who are earnestly trying to navigate and bal-
ance the competing pressures of their own work and care-
taking responsibilities; 
Whereas lockdowns and mandates as a response to the 
COVID–19 pandemic have deprived children of the social 
interaction they so desperately need as they grow; 
Whereas, due to mandates and attempts at virtual class-
rooms, students are falling behind academically, espe-
cially in low-income and underprivileged communities, 
and too many children are now experiencing mental 
health challenges and sustained learning loss; 
Whereas children are not at great risk for severe illness or 
death from COVID–19; 
Whereas across our Nation, divisive and destructive compo-
nents of Critical Race Theory (CRT) are finding their 
way into elementary-school-level curricula; and 
Whereas CRT puts forth the notion that the central feature 
of society is a power struggle between races: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives ex-
