RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
President Biden’s gun policies are unconstitutional and 
should never be approved. 
Whereas the right of the people to keep and bear arms is en-
shrined in our Constitution as the Second Amendment; 
Whereas our Nation’s Founders believed this right to be fun-
damental for Americans to protect themselves and the 
state of freedom; 
Whereas President Biden has directly attacked this right by 
issuing numerous Executive orders and calling for strict-
er gun control policies;

Whereas President Biden’s Executive actions on pistol-braced 
firearms are an unconstitutional attack on Americans ex-
ercising their Second Amendment rights; 
Whereas President Biden’s Executive actions on homemade 
firearms, such as 3D printed firearm files or unfinished 
receiver blanks, are an unconstitutional attack on Ameri-
cans exercising their Second Amendment rights; 
Whereas President Biden has called for Congress to pass un-
constitutional laws requiring background checks on all 
firearm transfers, unconstitutionally banning ‘‘assault 
weapons’’ and ‘‘high-capacity magazines’’, and holding 
law-abiding gun manufacturers liable for the acts of 
criminals; 
Whereas President Biden’s gun restriction proposals would 
effectively ban commonly owned firearms and magazines 
used for lawful purposes; 
Whereas President Biden’s gun restriction proposals would 
criminalize private firearm transfers; and 
Whereas President Biden’s gun restriction proposals would 
seek to hold gun manufacturers and dealers civilly liable, 
encouraging abuse of the court system to drive them out 
of business through meritless litigation: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-
1
resentatives that— 
2
(1) it should be the policy of the United States 
3
to strengthen the Second Amendment rights of 
4
Americans and prevent the potential erosion of these 
5
rights; and
