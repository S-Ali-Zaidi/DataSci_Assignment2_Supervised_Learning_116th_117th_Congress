Whereas irrationality, magical and conspiratorial thinking, 
and disbelief in science have undermined the national ef-
fort to combat the COVID–19 pandemic, contributing to 
the deaths of more than 555,000 people in the United 
States; 
Whereas reason and science are fundamental to implementing 
an effective coordinated response to beat the COVID–19 
virus, which includes improved social confidence in the 
safety and efficacy of vaccinations and evidence-based so-
lutions to the inequities exacerbated by the pandemic, 
and involves the Federal Government, the States, and the 
scientific and medical communities; 
Whereas America’s Founders insisted upon the primacy of 
reason and knowledge in public life, and drafted the Con-
stitution to prevent the official establishment of religion 
and to protect freedom of thought, speech, and inquiry 
in civil society; 
Whereas James Madison, author of the First Amendment 
and fourth President of the United States, stated that 
‘‘The advancement and diffusion of knowledge is the only 
guardian of true liberty’’, and ‘‘Knowledge will forever 
govern ignorance, and a people who mean to be their own 
governors, must arm themselves with the power knowl-
edge gives’’; and 
Whereas May 7, 2021, would be an appropriate date to des-
ignate as a ‘‘National Day of Reason’’: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the designation of a ‘‘National 
2
Day of Reason’’; and
