protect its citizens from handgun violence and acci-

9
ized users to continue to lawfully own and use their

12

15
Gun Safety, an unintentional shooting involving a 
16
child happens every 34 hours in the United States.

18
tion Survey, almost 350,000 incidents of firearm 
19
theft from private citizens occur each year.

21
tigation, 24 law enforcement officers were killed with
