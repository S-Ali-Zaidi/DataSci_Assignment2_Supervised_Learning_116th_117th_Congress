•HR 734 IH
(1) On January 30, 1919, Fred Toyosaburo 
1
Korematsu was born in Oakland, California, to Jap-
2
anese immigrants. 
3
(2) 
Fred 
Korematsu 
graduated 
from 
4
Castlemont High School in 1937 and attempted to 
5
enlist in the military twice but was unable to do so 
6
because his selective service classification was 
7
changed 
to 
enemy 
alien, 
even 
though 
Fred 
8
Korematsu was a United States citizen. 
9
(3) Fred Korematsu trained as a welder and 
10
worked as a foreman at the docks in Oakland until 
11
the date on which he and all Japanese Americans 
12
were fired. 
13
(4) On December 7, 1941, Japan attacked the 
14
military base in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, causing the 
15
United States to declare war against Japan. 
16
(5) On February 19, 1942, President Franklin 
17
D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066 (7 Fed. 
18
Reg. 1407 (February 25, 1942)), which authorized 
19
the Secretary of War to prescribe military areas— 
20
(A) from which any or all people could be 
21
excluded; and 
22
(B) with respect to which, the right of any 
23
person to enter, remain in, or leave would be

subject to any restriction the Military Com-
1
mander imposed in his discretion. 
2
(6) On May 3, 1942, the Lieutenant General of 
3
the Western Command of the Army issued Civilian 
4
Exclusion Order 34 (May 3, 1942) (referred to in 
5
this preamble as the ‘‘Civilian Exclusion Order’’) di-
6
recting that all people of Japanese ancestry be re-
7
moved from designated areas of the West Coast 
8
after May 9, 1942, because people of Japanese an-
9
cestry in the designated areas were considered to 
10
pose a threat to national security. 
11
(7) Fred Korematsu refused to comply with the 
12
Civilian Exclusion Order and was arrested on May 
13
30, 1942. 
14
(8) After his arrest, Fred Korematsu— 
15
(A) was held for 21⁄2 months in the Pre-
16
sidio stockade in San Francisco, California; 
17
(B) was convicted on September 8, 1942, 
18
of violating the Civilian Exclusion Order and 
19
sentenced to 5 years of probation; and 
20
(C) was detained at Tanforan Assembly 
21
Center, a former horse racetrack used as a 
22
holding facility for Japanese Americans before 
23
he was exiled with his family to the Topaz in-
24
carceration camp in the State of Utah.

(9) More than 120,000 Japanese Americans 
1
were similarly detained, with no charges brought and 
2
without due process, in 10 permanent War Reloca-
3
tion Authority camps located in isolated desert areas 
4
of the States of Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colo-
5
rado, Idaho, Utah, and Wyoming. 
6
(10) The people of the United States subject to 
7
the Civilian Exclusion Order lost their homes, liveli-
8
hoods, and the freedoms guaranteed to all people of 
9
the United States. 
10
(11) Fred Korematsu unsuccessfully challenged 
11
the Civilian Exclusion Order as it applied to him 
12
and appealed the decision of the United States Dis-
13
trict Court to the United States Court of Appeals 
14
for the Ninth Circuit, which sustained his conviction. 
15
(12) Fred Korematsu was subsequently con-
16
fined with his family in the incarceration camp in 
17
Topaz, Utah, for 2 years, and during that time, 
18
Fred Korematsu appealed his conviction to the Su-
19
preme Court of the United States. 
20
(13) On December 18, 1944, the Supreme 
21
Court of the United States issued Korematsu v. 
22
United States, 323 U.S. 214 (1944), which— 
23
(A) 
upheld 
the 
conviction 
of 
Fred 
24
Korematsu by a vote of 6 to 3; and 
25
22:59 Feb 21, 2021

•HR 734 IH
(B) concluded that Fred Korematsu was 
1
removed from his home not based on hostility 
2
toward him or other Japanese Americans but 
3
because the United States was at war with 
4
Japan and the military feared a Japanese inva-
5
sion of the West Coast. 
6
(14) In his dissenting opinion in Korematsu v. 
7
United States, 323 U.S. 214 (1944), Justice Frank 
8
Murphy called the Civilian Exclusion Order the ‘‘le-
9
galization of racism’’. 
10
(15) Two other Supreme Court Justices dis-
11
sented from the majority decision in Korematsu v. 
12
United States, including Justice Jackson who de-
13
scribed the validation of the principle of racial dis-
14
crimination as a ‘‘loaded weapon, ready for the hand 
15
of any authority that can bring forward a plausible 
16
claim of an urgent need’’. 
17
(16) Fred Korematsu continued to maintain his 
18
innocence for decades following World War II, and 
19
his conviction hampered his ability to gain employ-
20
ment. 
21
(17) In 1982, legal historian Peter Irons and 
22
researcher Aiko Yoshinaga-Herzig gained access to 
23
Government documents under section 552 of title 5, 
24
United States Code (commonly known as the ‘‘Free-
25
22:59 Feb 21, 2021

•HR 734 IH
dom of Information Act’’), that indicate that while 
1
the case of Fred Korematsu was before the Supreme 
2
Court of the United States, the Federal Government 
3
misled the Supreme Court of the United States and 
4
suppressed findings that Japanese Americans on the 
5
West Coast were not security threats. 
6
(18) In light of the newly discovered informa-
7
tion, Fred Korematsu filed a writ of error coram 
8
nobis with the United States District Court for the 
9
Northern District of California, and on November 
10
10, 1983, United States District Judge Marilyn Hall 
11
Patel issued her decision in Korematsu v. United 
12
States, 584 F. Supp. 1406 (N.D. Cal. 1984), that— 
13
(A) overturned the Federal conviction of 
14
Fred Korematsu; 
15
(B) concluded that, at the time that senior 
16
Government officials presented their case before 
17
the Supreme Court of the United States in 
18
1944, the senior Government officials knew 
19
there was no factual basis for the claim of mili-
20
tary necessity for the Civil Exclusion Order; 
21
(C) acknowledged that ‘‘the government 
22
knowingly withheld information from the courts 
23
when they were considering the critical question 
24
of military necessity’’ in the original case; 
25
22:59 Feb 21, 2021

•HR 734 IH
(D) recognized that ‘‘there is substantial 
1
support in the record that the government de-
2
liberately omitted relevant information and pro-
3
vided misleading information in papers before 
4
the court. The information was critical to the 
5
court’s determination’’; and 
6
(E) stated that although the decision of 
7
the Supreme Court of the United States in 
8
Korematsu v. United States, 323 U.S. 214 
9
(1944), remains on the pages of United States 
10
legal and political history, ‘‘[a]s historical 
11
precedent it stands as a constant caution that 
12
in times of war or declared military necessity 
13
our institutions must be vigilant in protecting 
14
constitutional guarantees’’. 
15
(19) The Commission on Wartime Relocation 
16
and Internment of Civilians, authorized by Congress 
17
in 1980 to review the facts and circumstances sur-
18
rounding the relocation and incarceration of Japa-
19
nese Americans under Executive Order 9066 (7 Fed. 
20
Reg. 1407 (February 25, 1942)), concluded that— 
21
(A) the decision of the Supreme Court of 
22
the United States in Korematsu v. United 
23
States, 323 U.S. 214 (1944), is overruled by 
24
the court of history;

(B) a grave personal injustice was done to 
1
the United States citizens and resident aliens of 
2
Japanese ancestry who, without individual re-
3
view or any probative evidence against them, 
4
were excluded, removed, and detained by the 
5
United States during World War II; and 
6
(C) the exclusion, removal, and detention 
7
of United States citizens and resident aliens of 
8
Japanese ancestry was motivated largely by 
9
‘‘racial prejudice, wartime hysteria, and a fail-
10
ure of political leadership’’. 
11
(20) The overturning of the conviction of Fred 
12
Korematsu and the findings of the Commission on 
13
Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians in-
14
fluenced the decision by Congress to pass the Civil 
15
Liberties Act of 1988 (50 U.S.C. 4211 et seq.) to 
16
request a Presidential apology and the symbolic pay-
17
ment of compensation to people of Japanese ances-
18
try who lost liberty or property due to discriminatory 
19
actions of the Federal Government. 
20
(21) On August 10, 1988, President Reagan 
21
signed the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 (50 U.S.C. 
22
4211 et seq.), stating, ‘‘[H]ere we admit a wrong; 
23
here we reaffirm our commitment as a nation to 
24
equal justice under the law.’’.

(22) On January 15, 1998, President Clinton 
1
awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the 
2
highest civilian award of the United States, to Fred 
3
Korematsu, stating, ‘‘[i]n the long history of our 
4
country’s constant search for justice, some names of 
5
ordinary citizens stand for millions of souls: Plessy, 
6
Brown, Parks. To that distinguished list, today we 
7
add the name of Fred Korematsu.’’. 
8
(23) Fred Korematsu remained a tireless advo-
9
cate for civil liberties and justice throughout his life 
10
by— 
11
(A) speaking out against racial discrimina-
12
tion and violence; and 
13
(B) cautioning the Federal Government 
14
against repeating mistakes of the past that sin-
15
gled out individuals for heightened scrutiny on 
16
the basis of race, ethnicity, nationality, or reli-
17
gion. 
18
(24) On March 30, 2005, Fred Korematsu died 
19
at the age of 86 in Marin County, California. 
20
(25) Fred Korematsu is a role model for all
