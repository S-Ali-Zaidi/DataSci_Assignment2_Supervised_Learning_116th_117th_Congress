(1) Millions of Southeast Asian Americans live 
1
in the United States, including 2,182,735 Viet-
2
namese Americans, 338,637 Cambodian Americans, 
3
254,304 Laotian Americans, and 326,843 Hmong 
4
Americans, according to the 2019 American Com-
5
munity Survey. Many of these communities arrived 
6
as refugees beginning over 40 years ago from Viet-
7
nam, Cambodia, and Laos, in the aftermath of the 
8
wars in Southeast Asia (more commonly known as 
9
the ‘‘Vietnam War’’). 
10
(2) The United States intervened in Cambodia, 
11
Laos, and Vietnam between 1954 and 1975, to pre-
12
vent the spread of communism in Southeast Asia 
13
through direct military interventions and covert and 
14
clandestine operations. 
15
(3) South Vietnam allied with the United 
16
States in opposition to the expansion of North Viet-
17
nam until the Fall of Saigon on April 30, 1975. As 
18
a result of this service, many Vietnamese Americans 
19
to this day still suffer lasting trauma from the war, 
20
including post-traumatic stress disorder and expo-
21
sure to Agent Orange. The Central Intelligence 
22
Agency (CIA) and various agencies enlisted over 
23
30,000 soldiers from Hmong, Lao, and Laotian eth-
24
nic groups in Laos as allies to aid United States

forces in Southeast Asia, waging a 13-year covert 
1
operation called the ‘‘Secret War’’ against the 
2
Pathet Lao, Viet Cong, and Northern Vietnamese 
3
Army. 
4
(4) The United States heavily bombed Laos, 
5
making it the most heavily bombed country in the 
6
world, with over 580,000 bombing missions between 
7
1964 and 1973. Today, an estimated 80,000,000 
8
bombs remain unexploded, with 20,000 people who 
9
have been injured or killed since the bombings 
10
stopped. 
11
(5) Between 1969 to 1973, the United States 
12
dropped 540,000 tons of bombs into Cambodia 
13
against Viet Cong forces, destabilizing the country’s 
14
already fragile government. This mass bombing of 
15
Cambodia’s countryside helping to fuel the rise of 
16
the Khmer Rouge, which subsequently carried out 
17
the destruction of Cambodian society and the geno-
18
cide of an estimated 2,000,000 Cambodians. 
19
(6) Over 3,000,000 individuals were displaced 
20
by war, conflict, and genocide from Vietnam, Cam-
21
bodia, and Laos. Between 1975 to 2008, the United 
22
States Government resettled over 1,200,000 South-
23
east Asian refugees in this country, as part of the 
24
largest refugee resettlement effort in the history of 
25

the United States. Southeast Asian refugees in-
1
cluded survivors of the war in Vietnam and Laos, 
2
the genocide in Cambodia, Hmong soldiers and their 
3
families who received refugee status in exchange for 
4
their service in the Secret War, and other ethnic mi-
5
nority groups persecuted in the aftermath of the 
6
war. 
7
(7) Many Southeast Asian refugees face signifi-
8
cant physical and mental health issues, such as post- 
9
traumatic stress disorder and depression, stemming 
10
from their experiences escaping war, genocide, tor-
11
ture, and mass starvation. Additionally, many 
12
Southeast Asian refugees were resettled in commu-
13
nities that were heavily disinvested and lacked long- 
14
term resettlement support, causing many Southeast 
15
Asians also suffer from systemic poverty, discrimina-
16
tion, and linguistic barriers. 
17
(8) Immigrant communities face significant 
18
challenges assimilating as a result of the trauma of 
19
war. A 2018 study published by Rashmi Gangamma 
20
and Daran Shipman in the Journal of Marital and 
21
Family Therapy noted that ‘‘the traumatic nature of 
22
(immigrant’s) forced displacement flight, and reset-
23
tlement can increase vulnerability to mental dis-
24
tress’’. First generation immigrants are especially 
25
16:45 Sep 28, 2022

•HR 8922 IH
vulnerable to gang violence within communities in 
1
which their parents cannot guide them with cultural 
2
or political familiarity. 
3
(9) Key policies during the 1990s including the 
4
period’s ‘‘War on Drugs’’, passage of the Violent 
5
Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, expansion 
6
of the carceral system, and over-policing of low-in-
7
come communities of color entangled a significant 
8
number of Southeast Asian Americans, especially 
9
Southeast Asian youth, within the criminal justice 
10
system. During this period, Southeast Asian youth 
11
were incarcerated at twice the rate of White youth 
12
for similar offenses. 
13
(10) Additional immigration policies during the 
14
1990s reinforced this emerging prison to deportation 
15
pipeline. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immi-
16
grant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) and the 
17
Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act 
18
(AEDPA) expanded the category of crimes that 
19
could lead to deportation and limited due process 
20
protections for noncitizens. IIRIRA also applied 
21
these changes retroactively without proper consider-
22
ation of an individual’s lived circumstances. 
23
(11) Approximately 15,000 long-term residents 
24
of Southeast Asian descent, many of whom initially 
25

arrived as child refugees, live in the United States 
1
with a final order of removal. These individuals 
2
often do not speak the native language of that coun-
3
try, lack familial connections there, and are at risk 
4
of being targeted for human rights abuses as a re-
5
sult of historic support for United States anti-com-
6
munist policies. 
7
(12) The United States accepted thousands of 
8
Vietnamese refugees through the Orderly Departure 
9
Program, Humanitarian Resettlement program, and 
10
McCain Amendment through 2009, including sur-
11
vivors of re-education centers, former employees of 
12
the United States Government and United States 
13
companies or organizations, and immediate family 
14
members. 
15
(13) In 2002, the United States and Cambodia 
16
signed a bilateral repatriation agreement, hereafter 
17
known as the 2002 U.S.-Cambodia Repatriation 
18
Agreement. Deportations of Cambodian Americans 
19
to Cambodia increased by 366 percent the following 
20
year. Over 1,000 Cambodian Americans have been 
21
deported to Cambodia since then. 
22
(14) In 2008, the United States and Vietnam 
23
signed a bilateral repatriation agreement, hereafter 
24
known as the 2008 U.S.-Vietnam Memorandum of 
25
16:45 Sep 28, 2022

Understanding (MOU). According to section 2, arti-
1
cle 2 of the 2008 Vietnam-U.S. MOU, ‘‘Vietnamese 
2
citizens are not subject to return to Vietnam under 
3
this Agreement if they arrived in the United States 
4
before July 12, 1995, the date on which diplomatic 
5
relations were re-established between the U.S. Gov-
6
ernment and the Vietnamese Government’’. Presi-
7
dent George W. Bush and President Barack Obama 
8
both recognized the 2008 United States-Vietnam 
9
MOU’s removal protections for pre-1995 refugees. 
10
(15) In 2020, President Trump’s administra-
11
tion entered into a new memorandum of under-
12
standing with Vietnam, expanding the categories of 
13
immigrants it could deport to include pre-95 Viet-
14
namese refugees who were previously protected from 
15
removal by the 2008 MOU.
