•HR 8496 IH
(1) The executive branch does not have the 
1
statutory authority to cancel student loans on a

(2) Student loan forgiveness is unfair to those 
4
who have already paid off their loans and to those 
5

11
(5) Community and technical colleges are a fan-
12
tastic way for students to learn a valuable skill set 
13
without taking on a large debt burden.
