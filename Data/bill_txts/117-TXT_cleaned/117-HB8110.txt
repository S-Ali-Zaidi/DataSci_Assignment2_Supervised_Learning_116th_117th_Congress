SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Hmong Congressional 
2
Gold Medal Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
The Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) As the Vietnam war spread south and west 
6
into Laos, the Central Intelligence Agency recruited 
7
and trained Hmong tribesmen to fight back against 
8
the communist North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao. 
9
(2) Over 30,000 Hmong men fought the ground 
10
war, flew combat missions, gathered intelligence on 
11
North Vietnamese troop movements, interrupted the 
12
Ho-Chi-Min Supply Trail, and rescued American pi-
13
lots downed behind enemy lines. 
14
(3) The Hmong people suffered heavy casual-
15
ties, and their soldiers died at a rate ten times as 
16
high as that of American soldiers in Vietnam. 
17
(4) Following the Vietnam war, many Hmong 
18
were displaced from their villages as they were either 
19
bombed or burned down by the North Vietnamese 
20
and over 150,000 Hmong fled Laos when the nation 
21
fell to communist forces on May 14, 1975. 
22
(5) Due to their ties to the American military, 
23
many Hmong who fled Laos came to the United 
24
States as refugees to start a new life.
