Black Deaf son, Kenneth, and other Black Deaf children 
who were denied admission to the Kendall School, with 
the aim of ending segregation and having their Black 
Deaf children educated within the District; 
Whereas, on July 3, 1952, the United States District Court 
for the District of Columbia ruled in their favor in Miller 
v. Board of Education of District of Columbia, stating 
that African Americans could not be sent outside a State 
or district to obtain the same education that White stu-

School Division II at Gallaudet in 1953, which educated 
23 Black Deaf children until its closure in 1954 following 
the Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Edu-

schools was unconstitutional: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate
