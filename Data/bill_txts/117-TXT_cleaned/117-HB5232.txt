The Congress finds the following:

•HR 5232 IH
(1) Dogs going back thousands of years have 
1
been tied to humans whether protection, companion-
2
ship, or assisting in daily activities. 
3
(2) The United States had an unofficial canine 
4
military presence assisting soldiers in the Civil War 
5
and World War I, but military K–9s did not become 
6
officially recognized until March 13, 1942. During 
7
the height on the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq it 
8
is estimated that the United States military em-
9
ployed near 2,500 K–9s. 
10
(3) Military K–9s have seen service in every 
11
major United States combat since World War I and 
12
have been praised by military leadership as an indis-
13
pensable asset for military, police, government, and 
14
private security teams around the world. 
15
(4) In 2000, Congress passed ‘‘Robby’s Law’’ 
16
which allowed for the adoption of military K–9s by 
17
law enforcement agencies, former handlers, and 
18
other care groups. 
19
(5) Since 2000, military K–9s have left service 
20
and gone onto work explosive detection for police 
21
forces, and work as service dogs for veterans and 
22
families. 
23
(6) Beyond their military working capacity, 
24
working dogs provide enhanced mobility assist and

renewed independence for the injured and disabled. 
1
Service dogs are able to support veterans struggling 
2
after war, hear for those who are deaf, see for those 
3
who are blind, and even sense changes in a person’s 
4
body before a seizure. Working dogs play a vital role 
5
in improving the lives of many. 
6
(7) The service dog programs of America’s 
7
VetDogs were created to provide enhanced mobility 
8
and renewed independence to United States vet-
9
erans, active-duty service members, and first re-
10
sponders with disabilities. 
11
(8) America’s VetDogs provides— 
12
(A) guide dogs for individuals who are 
13
blind or have low vision; 
14
(B) hearing dogs for those who have lost 
15
their hearing later in life by alerting to alarms, 
16
door bells, sirens, and more; 
17
(C) service dogs for those with other phys-
18
ical disabilities that are specially trained to pro-
19
vide balance, retrieve dropped items, open and 
20
close doors, turn on and off lights, carry a 
21
backpack, and more; 
22
(D) facility dogs which are specially 
23
trained to spend time working with wounded

veterans recovering at military hospitals and

4
become an essential part of the healing process; 
5
and

(F) PTSD service dogs that are trained to

help mitigate the symptoms of PTSD by pro-
