To remove college cost as a barrier to every student having 
access to a well-prepared and diverse educator workforce, 
and for other purposes.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Diversifying by Invest-
2
ing in Educators and Students to Improve Outcomes For 
3
Youth Act’’ or the ‘‘Diversify Act’’. 
4
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
5
Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) Schools predominantly enrolling historically 
7
underserved students are often disproportionately 
8
impacted by teacher shortages. 
9
(2) According to Department of Education data 
10
for the 2020–2021 school year, to date 43 States 
11
are reporting shortages in mathematics teachers, 42 
12
in science teachers, and 44 in special education 
13
teachers. 
14
(3) Data shows that, between 2009 and 2017, 
15
teacher education enrollments dropped from 691,000 
16
to 444,000, a 38-percent reduction. This amounts to 
17
a decrease of about 340,000 professionals on their 
18
way to becoming teachers in the year 2017, as com-
19
pared to 2009. 
20
(4) Current data show that the impacts of 
21
COVID–19 may be further exacerbating student ac-
22
cess to well-prepared and diverse teachers through 
23
declining higher education enrollments and potential 
24
increased turnover due to pandemic teaching condi-
25
tions, among other factors. 
26

(5) About 80 percent of educators begin teach-
1
ing with a bachelor’s degree, yet the latest Federal 
2
data show a nearly 6-percent decline in under-
3
graduate enrollment in the Spring of 2021. Enroll-
4
ment declines have inequitably impacted students of 
5
color. 
6
(6) In an August 2020 Census Bureau survey, 
7
respondents cited their inability to pay as a factor 
8
in their decision to forgo college. 
9
(7) Research suggests that service scholarship 
10
programs like the TEACH Grant Program are suc-
11
cessful when they are both administratively manage-
12
able and when subsidies are large enough to sub-
13
stantially offset training costs. Efforts to increase 
14
the TEACH Grant award amount must be combined 
15
with efforts to ensure that the program is adminis-
16
tratively manageable. In order for the TEACH 
17
Grant Program to meet its full potential, the re-
18
search is clear that both criteria need to be ad-
19
dressed. 
20
(8) The TEACH Grant’s award amount has not 
21
increased since its creation in the bipartisan College 
22
Cost Reduction and Access Act (Public Law 110– 
23
84). In addition, due to the Budget Control Act of 
24
2011 (Public Law 112–25), the maximum amount 
25

•HR 3393 IH
of grant aid available under the TEACH Grant Pro-
1
gram of $4,000 a year has been cut for a majority 
2
of the program’s existence. This comes at a time 
3
when the yearly full cost of a public 4-year college 
4
for an in-State student exceeds $20,000. Further, 
5
more than two-thirds of individuals entering the field 
6
of education borrow money to pay for their higher 
7
education, resulting in an average debt of about 
8
$20,000 for those with a bachelor’s degree and 
9
$50,000 for those with a master’s degree. 
10
(9) Grant programs can eliminate or reduce the 
11
need to borrow student loans in order to afford a 
12
college education. This is important because a col-
13
lege student’s potential debt burden influences the 
14
student’s decisions about what profession to enter, 
15
with the result that the student is less likely to pur-
16
sue a career in education or take other low-paying 
17
jobs after graduation if the student expects to incur 
18
more debt. This is especially true for students of 
19
color, who, according to a recent report, are more 
20
likely to come from families that are unable to con-
21
tribute financially to their higher education. 
22
(10) Students with disabilities, including stu-
23
dents of color with disabilities, are also likely to ac-
24
crue significant student loan debt. This often results 
25

•HR 3393 IH
from limited ability to work while in school due to 
1
the increased time needed for coursework. 
2
(11) Teachers of color face unique barriers to 
3
entering and staying in the profession. For example, 
4
teachers of color are more likely to enter teaching 
5
through alternative pathways due to the high cost of 
6
traditional teacher preparation programs and the 
7
debt burden faced by college students of color. 
8
Lower quality pathways can result in less effective 
9
teaching and high turnover rates. Research shows 
10
that candidates who receive comprehensive prepara-
11
tion are 2 to 3 times more likely to stay in teaching 
12
than those who receive little training. In many cases, 
13
however, teachers of color are more likely to begin 
14
teaching without having completed comprehensive 
15
preparation and entering instead through alternative 
16
routes that often skip student teaching and key 
17
coursework, leaving teachers to learn on the job. 
18
(12) Research shows that recruiting and retain-
19
ing a diverse teacher workforce is key to improving 
20
outcomes for all students and for closing achieve-
21
ment gaps. While White students also benefit by 
22
learning from teachers of color, the impact is espe-
23
cially significant for students of color, who have 
24
higher test scores, are more likely to graduate from

high school, and more likely to succeed in college 
1
when they have had teachers of color who serve as 
2
role models and support their attachment to school 
3
and learning.
