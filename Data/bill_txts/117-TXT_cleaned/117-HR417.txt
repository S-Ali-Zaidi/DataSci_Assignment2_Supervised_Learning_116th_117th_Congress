security. 
Whereas, in May 2021, the total public debt outstanding was

terest expense of more than $390,000,000,000 for fiscal 
year 2020; 
Whereas, on May 18, 2021, the total public debt as a per-

Whereas, on May 18, 2021, the debt owed per citizen was 
$84,940 and $225,309 per taxpayer; 
Whereas the last balanced Federal budget was signed into 
law in 1997; 
Whereas, in fiscal year 2020, Federal tax receipts totaled 
$3,420,000,000,000, 
but 
Federal 
outlays 
totaled 
$6,652,000,000,000, leaving the Federal Government 
with a 1-year deficit of $3,132,000,000,000; 
Whereas every year since the last balanced Federal budget 
was signed in 1997, Congress has failed to maintain a 
fiscally responsible budget and has typically relied on 
raising the debt ceiling; 
Whereas the House of Representatives failed to pass a bal-
anced budget for fiscal year 2019 and failed to restore 
regular order to the legislative process by not allowing 
Representatives to offer and debate amendments; 
Whereas regular order permits the House of Representatives 
to separately debate and adopt all appropriations bills in 
a timely fashion and facilitates congressional oversight of 
Federal spending; 
Whereas the Social Security and Medicare Boards of Trust-
ees project that the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust 
Fund will be depleted in 2026; 
Whereas the Social Security and Medicare Boards of Trust-
ees project that the Federal Old-Age and Survivors In-
surance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance 
Trust Fund will be depleted in 2031; 
Whereas the credit rating of the United States was reduced 
by Standard and Poor’s from AAA to AA+ on August 
5, 2011, and has remained at that level since that date;

Whereas without a targeted effort to balance the Federal 
budget, the credit rating of the United States is certain 
to continue to fall; 
Whereas improvements in the business climate in populous 
countries, and aging populations around the world, will 
likely contribute to higher global interest rates; 
Whereas more than $7,000,000,000,000 of Federal debt is 
owned by individuals not located in the United States, in-
cluding more than $1,000,000,000,000 of which is owned 
by individuals in China; 
Whereas China and the European Union are developing alter-
native payment systems to weaken the dominant position 
of the United States dollar as a reserve currency; 
Whereas rapidly increasing interest rates will squeeze all pol-
icy priorities of the United States, including defense pol-
icy and foreign policy priorities; 
Whereas, on April 12, 2018, former Secretary of Defense 
James Mattis warned that ‘‘any Nation that can’t keep 
its fiscal house in order eventually cannot maintain its 
military power’’; 
Whereas, on March 6, 2018, former Director of National In-
telligence Dan Coats warned: ‘‘Our continued plunge into 
debt is unsustainable and represents a dire future threat 
to our economy and to our national security’’; 
Whereas, on November 15, 2017, former Secretaries of De-
fense Leon Panetta, Ash Carter, and Chuck Hagel 
warned: ‘‘Increase in the debt will, in the absence of a 
comprehensive budget that addresses both entitlements 
and revenues, force even deeper reductions in our na-
tional security capabilities’’; and

•HRES 417 IH 
Whereas, on September 22, 2011, former Chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff Michael Mullen warned: ‘‘I believe 
the single, biggest threat to our national security is 
debt’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) recognizes that the national debt is a threat 
2
to the national security of the United States; 
3
(2) realizes that deficits are unsustainable, irre-
4
sponsible, and dangerous; 
5
(3) commits to restoring regular order in the 
6
appropriations process; and 
7
(4) commits to addressing the fiscal crisis faced 
8
by the United States.
