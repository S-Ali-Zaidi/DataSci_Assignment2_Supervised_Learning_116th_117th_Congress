and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
6
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:

H4461
2 
•HR 4461 IH
(1) In the year 2018, funding for research and 
1
development in science and technology in the United 
2
States was $124.7 billion, or approximately 0.6 per-
3
cent of the gross domestic product. 
4
(2) In the year 1964, the United States spent 
5
approximately 2 percent of gross domestic product 
6
on research and development in science and tech-
7
nology. 
8
(3) Public funding for research and develop-
9
ment in science and technology financed a majority 
10
of the innovations that powered growth in the 
11
United States after World War II, including digital 
12
computing and modern pharmaceutical science. 
13
(4) The United States currently ranks ninth in 
14
the world for total percentage of gross domestic 
15
product used for research and development in 
16
science and technology and twelfth in the world for 
17
public funding for research and development in 
18
science and technology. 
19
(5) Funding for research and development in 
20
science and technology is concentrated in a small 
21
number of geographic regions in the United States. 
22
(6) Established technology centers that promote 
23
research and development in science and technology 
24
are extremely crowded, have high real estate costs, 
25
03:25 Aug 01, 2021
H4461
3 
•HR 4461 IH
and are in locations that require long commutes for 
1
many of the researchers at such centers. 
2
(7) The private sector has a limited ability or 
3
desire to invest outside of such centers, which limits 
4
the potential for growth in science and technology, 
5
including the availability of employment opportuni-
6
ties in such industries. 
7
(8) Increasing public funding for research and 
8
development in science and technology to 1 percent 
9
of the gross domestic product would significantly in-
10
crease the rank of the United States with respect to 
11
funding for such research and development among 
12
developed countries. 
13
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of the 
14
Congress that amounts provided through this Act will be 
15
used— 
16
(1) in a manner that is similar to break-
17
through-focused, project management models of the 
18
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency of the 
19
Department of Defense; and 
20
(2) to supplement existing funding to Federal 
21
agencies.
