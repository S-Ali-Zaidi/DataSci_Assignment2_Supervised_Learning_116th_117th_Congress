(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
4
(1) Communities of color, low-income commu-
5
nities, Tribal and Indigenous communities, fossil 
6
fuel-dependent communities, and other vulnerable 
7
populations, such as persons with disabilities, chil-

dren, and the elderly, are disproportionately bur-
1
dened by environmental hazards that include expo-
2
sure to polluted air, waterways, and landscapes. 
3
(2) Environmental justice disparities are also 
4
exhibited through a lack of equitable access to green 
5
spaces, public recreation opportunities, and informa-
6
tion and data on potential exposure to environmental 
7
hazards. 
8
(3) Communities experiencing environmental in-
9
justice have been subjected to systemic racial, social, 
10
and economic injustices and face a disproportionate 
11
burden of adverse human health or environmental 
12
effects, a higher risk of intentional, unconscious, and 
13
structural discrimination, and disproportionate en-
14
ergy burdens. 
15
(4) Environmental justice communities have 
16
been made more vulnerable to the effects of climate 
17
change due to a combination of factors, particularly 
18
the legacy of segregation and historically racist zon-
19
ing codes, and often have the least resources to re-
20
spond, making it a necessity for environmental jus-
21
tice communities to be meaningfully engaged as 
22
partners and stakeholders in government decision 
23
making as the United States builds its climate resil-
24
ience.

•HR 2021 IH
(5) Potential environmental and climate threats 
1
to environmental justice communities merit a higher 
2
level of engagement, review, and consent to ensure 
3
that communities are not forced to bear dispropor-
4
tionate environmental and health impacts. 
5
(6) The burden of proof that a proposed action 
6
will not harm communities, including through cumu-
7
lative exposure effects, should fall on polluting in-
8
dustries and on the Federal Government in its regu-
9
latory role, not the communities themselves. 
10
(7) Executive Order 12898 (42 U.S.C. 4321 
11
note; relating to Federal actions to address environ-
12
mental justice in minority populations and low-in-
13
come populations) directs Federal agencies to ad-
14
dress disproportionately high and adverse human 
15
health or environmental effects of its programs, but 
16
Federal agencies have been inconsistent in updating 
17
their strategic plans for environmental justice and 
18
reporting on their progress in enacting those plans. 
19
(8) Government action to correct environmental 
20
injustices is a moral imperative. Federal policy can 
21
and should improve public health and improve the 
22
overall well-being of all communities. 
23
(9) All people have the right to breathe clean 
24
air, drink clean water, live free of dangerous levels

of toxic pollution, and share the benefits of a pros-
1
perous and vibrant pollution-free economy. 
2
(10) A fair and just transition to a pollution- 
3
free economy is necessary to ensure that workers 
4
and communities in deindustrialized areas have ac-
5
cess to the resources and benefits of a sustainable 
6
future. That transition must also address the eco-
7
nomic disparities experienced by residents living in 
8
areas contaminated by pollution or environmental 
9
degradation, including access to jobs, and members 
10
of those communities must be fully and meaningfully 
11
involved in transition planning processes. 
12
(11) It is the responsibility of the Federal Gov-
13
ernment to seek to achieve environmental justice, 
14
health equity, and climate justice for all commu-
15
nities. 
16
(b) STATEMENT OF POLICY.—It is the policy of Con-
17
gress that each Federal agency should— 
18
(1) seek to achieve environmental justice as 
19
part of its mission by identifying and addressing, as 
20
appropriate, 
disproportionately 
adverse 
human 
21
health or environmental effects of its programs, poli-
22

23

the United States;

(2) promote meaningful involvement by commu-
3
nities and due process in the development, imple-
4
mentation, and enforcement of environmental laws; 
5
(3) provide direct guidance and technical assist-
6
ance to communities experiencing environmental in-
7
justice focused on increasing shared understanding 
8
of the science, laws, regulations, and policy related 
9
to Federal agency action on environmental justice 
10
issues; 
11
(4) cooperate with State governments, Tribal 
12
Governments, and local governments to address pol-
13
lution and public health burdens in communities ex-
14
periencing 
environmental 
injustice, 
and 
build 
15
healthy, sustainable, and resilient communities; and 
16
(5) recognize the right of all people to clean air, 
17
safe and affordable drinking water, protection from 
18
climate hazards, and the sustainable preservation of 
19
the ecological integrity and aesthetic, scientific, cul-
20
