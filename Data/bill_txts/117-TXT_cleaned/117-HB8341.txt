1
It is the Sense of Congress that— 
2
(1) 50 years ago, our Nation came together 
3
unanimously to expand the franchise to those 18 
4
years of age and older and to outlaw age-based dis-
5
crimination in accessing the franchise; 
6
(2) 50 years later, the promises of the 26th 
7
Amendment to the Constitution of the United States 
8
(referred to in this Act as the ‘‘26th Amendment’’) 
9
remain unfulfilled although the reasons that moti-
10
vated its ratification endure; and 
11
(3) pursuant to section 2 of the 26th Amend-
12
ment, Congress is empowered to enforce the article 
13
by appropriate legislation and acts accordingly in 
14
this Act. 
15
SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
16
Congress finds the following: 
17
(1) Over 50 years ago, on July 1, 1971, this 
18
Nation ratified into the Constitution of the United 
19
States the 26th Amendment, lowering the voting age 
20

•HR 8341 IH
from 21 to 18 years of age and outlawing the denial 
1
or abridgement of the right to vote on account of 
2
age. 
3
(2) Support for the 26th Amendment was near-
4
ly unanimous. The proposed constitutional amend-
5
ment passed with bipartisan supermajorities, passing 
6
in the Senate with a vote of 94–0, and passing in 
7
the House of Representatives with a vote of 401–19. 
8
The 26th Amendment was approved by the requisite 
9
38 States in less than 100 days, making it the 
10
quickest constitutional amendment to be ratified in 
11
United States history. 
12
(3) Support for lowering the voting age to 18 
13
was championed across the aisle. President Dwight 
14
Eisenhower, former Commander of the Allied 
15
Forces, included the issue in his 1954 State of the 
16
Union Address. Moreover, President Richard Nixon 
17
emphasized his support for the 26th Amendment 
18
during its certification ceremony, describing that 
19
young people serve a critical role by infusing the 
20
practice of democracy with ‘‘some idealism, some 
21
courage, some stamina, some high moral purpose 
22
that this Nation always needs, because a country, 
23
throughout history, we find, goes through ebbs and 
24
flows of idealism.’’. Similarly, Senate Majority Lead-
25

•HR 8341 IH
er Michael Mansfield and Senator Ted Kennedy 
1
were key advocates of the measure, having first pro-
2
posed a statutory route for lowering the voting age 
3
in the Voting Rights Act Amendments of 1970 
4
(Public Law 91–285), in addition to supporting a 
5
path through constitutional ratification. 
6
(4) The Voting Rights Act Amendments of 
7
1970 (Public Law 91–285) marked the first Federal 
8
law to enfranchise youth and outlaw age discrimina-
9
tion in accessing the franchise. In title III of that 
10
Act, Congress declared, with strong bipartisan sup-
11
port, that the 21-year age requirement— 
12
(A) ‘‘denies and abridges the inherent con-
13
stitutional rights of citizens eighteen years of 
14
age but not yet twenty-one years of age to 
15
vote’’; 
16
(B) has the effect of denying those 
17
disenfranchised ‘‘the due process and equal pro-
18
tection of the laws that are guaranteed to them 
19
under the Fourteenth Amendment’’; and 
20
(C) ‘‘does not bear a reasonable relation-
21
ship to any compelling State interest.’’. 
22
(5) The age-based expansion of the franchise 
23
via the Voting Rights Act Amendments of 1970 was 
24
ultimately found by a strongly divided Supreme 
25
05:30 Jul 14, 2022
H8341
5 
•HR 8341 IH
Court to be unconstitutional as applied to State and 
1
local races and constitutional as applied to Federal 
2
races. Thus, to ensure uniform election administra-
3
tion in Federal and State races, a constitutional so-
4
lution was required. 
5
(6) A variety of reasons were advanced to sup-
6
port ratification of the 26th Amendment. The 
7
emerging themes included— 
8
(A) the value of idealism, courage, and 
9
moral purpose that youth provide in reener-
10
gizing the practice of democracy; 
11
(B) the increased political competence of 
12
young people compared to prior generations, 
13
due to greater access to information through 
14
standardized education and technology such as 
15
then-widely available television sets; 
16
(C) the increased responsibilities assumed 
17
by the group as they fought in war, assumed 
18
debt, and lived independently; 
19
(D) a general recognition of the Nation’s 
20
expansion toward a more inclusive suffrage; and 
21
(E) the stemming of unrest by encouraging 
22
institutionalized 
mechanisms 
to 
advance 
23
change.

(7) In referring the 26th Amendment to the 
1
States for ratification, Congress invoked the Voting 
2
Rights Act and the principles protected by the 14th 
3
Amendment to the Constitution of the United 
4
States, explaining that ‘‘[F]orcing young voters to 
5
undertake special burdens-obtaining absentee ballots, 
6
or traveling to one centralized location in each city, 
7
for example-in order to exercise their right to vote 
8
might well serve to dissuade them from participating 
9
in the election. This result, and the election proce-
10
dures that create it, are at least inconsistent with 
11
the purpose of the Voting Rights [A]ct, which 
12
sought to encourage greater political participation on 
13
the part of the young; such segregation might even 
14
amount to a denial of their 14th Amendment right 
15
to equal protection of the laws in the exercise of the 
16
franchise.’’. 
17
(8) According to the Center for Information & 
18
Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (re-
19
ferred to in this Act as ‘‘CIRCLE’’) of Tufts Uni-
20
versity, a record-high 28 percent of young people 
21
voted in the 2018 midterm elections, more than dou-
22
bling the record-low 13 percent youth turnout in 
23
2014. Still, young people vote at lower levels than 
24
older adults. 
25

(9) Lower youth voting rates are not a sign of 
1
generational apathy but of systemic barriers and 
2
issues with the culture of political engagement that 
3
have plagued young people of various generations for 
4
decades. Individuals that were part of older genera-
5
tions voted at similar rates as individuals in the Mil-
6
lennial and Gen Z generations when those older gen-
7
erations were youth. For the first presidential elec-
8
tion in which a generation’s entire 18–24 age cohort 
9
was eligible to vote (1972 for Boomers, 1992 for 
10
Gen X, and 2008 for Millennials), each participated 
11
at about 50 percent. 
12
(10) The outsized reliance by young voters on 
13
provisional ballots in recent years demonstrates the 
14
structural obstacles young voters face due to voter 
15
restrictions. A 2016 survey found that 1 in 4 
16
Millennials voted provisionally in the 2016 race, 
17
compared to 6 percent of Baby Boomers, and 2 per-
18
cent of the Greatest Generation. 
19
(11) In addition to voting provisionally at dis-
20
proportionate rates, young voters’ provisional ballots 
21
are also disproportionally rejected. As determined by 
22
a recent Federal court, voters aged 18 to 21 in Flor-
23
ida had their provisional ballots rejected at a rate 
24
more than 4 times higher than the rejection rate for 
25
05:30 Jul 14, 2022
H8341
8 
•HR 8341 IH
provisional ballots cast by voters between the ages of 
1
45 to 64. 
2
(12) Similarly, young voters experience a higher 
3
rejection rate of vote-by-mail ballots compared to 
4
older voters. One study found that voters aged 18 to 
5
21 had their vote-by-mail ballots rejected at a rate 
6
of over 5 times that of voters between the ages of 
7
45 to 64 and over 8 times those over the age of 65. 
8
These rejection rates trend with those of voters of 
9
color. For example, the study found that the rate of 
10
rejection of vote-by-mail ballots for Hispanic and Af-
11
rican American voters is over 2 times that of White 
12
voters. 
13
(13) Moreover, when special burdens are re-
14
moved, young people vote more frequently. Once 
15
polling places were finally situated on campuses dur-
16
ing the early voting period, pursuant to successful 
17
26th Amendment litigation, one study found that on 
18
12 campuses alone, nearly 60,000 registered voters 
19
participated in the 2018 general election through 
20
early in-person voting. Young voters, people of color, 
21
and those who did not cast a ballot in 2016 dis-
22
proportionately voted at the on-campus voting loca-
23
tions. Voter turnout is bolstered by on-campus vot-
24
ing locations because those locations lower the op-
25

•HR 8341 IH
portunity costs for voting for all registered voters, 
1
particularly for young registered voters. 
2
(14) Young people are passionate about polit-
3
ical issues and often want to engage in the political 
4
process, but they face barriers to participation. For 
5
example, they may face structural obstacles such as 
6
proof requirements that obscure a young person’s 
7
right to vote, barriers to voter registration, inacces-
8
sible or poorly equipped polling places, campus ger-
9
rymanders, over-reliance on provisional ballots, and 
10
unfair treatment of provisional and vote-by-mail bal-
11
lots. Some of these barriers are acute for the young-
12
est voters who are particularly transient and move 
13
every year, thereby struggling to update their voter 
14
registration, or who are less likely to have a driver’s 
15
license to use as voter identification. Youth voters 
16
are similarly vulnerable to confusion about their 
17
right to vote from their campus residences. Although 
18
the Supreme Court summarily affirmed the right of 
19
college students to vote from their campus resi-
20
dences in 1979, pursuant to the 26th Amendment, 
21
misinformation and disinformation persist about this 
22
right. Congress finds that students indeed have a 
23
right to vote from their campus residences. Relat-
24
edly, many young people have not been taught about 
25

•HR 8341 IH
elections and voting, including the practicalities of 
1
registering and casting a ballot and the reasons why 
2
their voices and votes matter in democracy. 
3
(15) Studies reinforce the habit-forming nature 
4
of voting, making it all the more important that vot-
5
ing becomes normalized at an early age through un-
6
obstructed access to the ballot. For example, a re-
7
cent study found that on average, voting in 1 elec-
8
tion increases the probability of voting in a future 
9
election by 10 percentage points. 
10
(16) According to CIRCLE, youth without col-
11
lege experience also tend to vote at lower rates than 
12
young people in college. For example, in 2018, 28 
13
percent of youth (ages 18–29) voted, while the Insti-
14
tute for Democracy & Higher Education of Tufts 
15
University estimated that 40 percent of college stu-
16
dents cast a ballot. There are disparities by age, and 
17
even among youth; the youngest group (ages 18 and 
18
19) vote at lower rates. There are also disparities by 
19
urbanicity, with young people in rural areas and 
20
other civic deserts having lower voter turnout. 
21
(17) According to CIRCLE, low-income youth 
22
are acutely impacted, since their economic struggles 
23
translate into multiple logistical barriers to voting. A 
24
05:30 Jul 14, 2022
H8341
11 
•HR 8341 IH
recent survey of low-income youth found that young 
1
voters reported barriers to voting, including— 
2
(A) confusion with voter identification 
3
rules (88 percent); 
4
(B) confusion about the impact of voter 
5
disenfranchisement (42 percent reported lack of 
6
clarity about whether someone who paid a fine 
7
for driving under the influence could vote or if 
8
someone with a suspended driver’s license could 
9
vote); 
10
(C) confusion about the location of polling 
11
places (39 percent did not know where to vote); 
12
and 
13
(D) a high lack of confidence that they 
14
would be fully prepared to vote if an election 
15
happened ‘‘next week’’ (only half of surveyed 
16
youth reported confidence). 
17
(18) Moreover, youth reported negative voting 
18
experiences due to failure to see young people work-
19
ing at the polls (87 percent), failure to see poll 
20
workers that look like them (74 percent), and not 
21
believing that election officials make an effort to en-
22
sure that people like them can vote (59 percent). 
23
(19) Presidential election years are particularly 
24
consequential for youth voter engagement. For ex-
25
05:30 Jul 14, 2022
H8341
12 
•HR 8341 IH
ample, 61 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds were reg-
1
istered to vote in 2008, compared to 49 percent in 
2
2010. Moreover, youth who registered to vote are 
3
considerably more likely to vote. Among youth reg-
4
istered in 2008, 84 percent cast a ballot. 
5
(20) While direct youth voter registration, out-
6
reach, and engagement is typically heightened in the 
7
Summer and Fall months leading up to presidential 
8
elections, unprecedented obstacles have presented 
9
themselves amid the COVID–19 pandemic as the 
10
economy slowed, the Nation shut down, and institu-
11
tions of higher education, technical and vocational 
12
schools, and high schools changed their normal oper-
13
ations. 
14
(21) The 2020 primary cycle shed light on the 
15
unique obstacles faced by young voters in uncertain 
16
times as they were displaced from the college 
17
domiciles where they would eventually return. Con-
18
fused and misinformed about their right to vote 
19
from campus despite the temporary relocation, these 
20
voters had to adjust for the first time to obtaining, 
21
printing, properly filling out and submitting along 
22
with required proofs, and mailing postage-required 
23
official forms and paperwork, such as voter registra-
24
05:30 Jul 14, 2022
H8341
13 
•HR 8341 IH
tion forms, absentee ballot requests, and absentee 
1
ballots. 
2
(22) The 2020 election resulted in unprece-
3
dented voter turnout overall, boasting the highest 
4
turnout in United States history, with 17,000,000 
5
more voters compared to the last presidential cycle. 
6
The unprecedented trend tracked for youth voters as 
7
well. 2020 was the first election in which the major-
8
ity of voters under the age of 30 voted. States with 
9
the highest youth voter rates were those with more 
10
robust registration and vote by mail laws, such as 
11
those with pre-registration, same day registration, 
12
election day registration, early voting, and accessible 
13
no-excuse vote by mail opportunities. 
14
(23) The response to increased voter turnout 
15
has been an unprecedented number of State legisla-
16
tive proposals to make it harder to cast a valid bal-
17
lot, such as the imposition of limitations on the 
18
availability of drop-boxes, the counting of out-of-pre-
19
cinct ballots, and the inclusion of student identifica-
20
tion as valid voter identification where required. 
21
Pressures have also mounted on the local level, with 
22
continued efforts to prevent or remove on-campus 
23
polling locations, which are key to youth engagement
