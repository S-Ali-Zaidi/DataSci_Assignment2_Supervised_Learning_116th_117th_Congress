(1) Recovery from the devastation caused by 
1
natural disasters should be agile, effective, and pro-
2
mote resiliency for future disasters. Other priorities 
3
include promoting accountability and transparency 
4
in the use of Federal funds that will be spent in 
5
these efforts and implementing mechanisms to en-
6
sure those ends. 
7
(2) The current systems of the agencies in 
8
charge of recovery in Puerto Rico are over-central-
9
ized and do not serve the purpose of agile and effec-
10
tive planning and implementation or of effective 
11
monitoring and accounting. 
12
(3) The centralized system of Federal recovery 
13
spending for Puerto Rico excludes most communities 
14
from program design and program implementation 
15
prioritization, does not take advantage of the local 
16
historical and institutional knowledge on the use of 
17
Federal recovery funds, and is not as flexible and re-
18
sponsive as the local implementation network. 
19
(4) An Office for Equitable, Transparent, and 
20
Accountable Puerto Rico Reconstruction should be 
21
established so that diverse civil society leaders in 
22
Puerto Rico are in positions to help ensure equi-
23
table, effective, transparent, and accountable recov-
24
ery and development of Puerto Rico.
