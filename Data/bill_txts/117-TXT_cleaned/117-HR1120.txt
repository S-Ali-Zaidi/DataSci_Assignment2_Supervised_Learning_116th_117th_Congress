Whereas public works professionals focus on infrastructure, 
facilities, and services that are of vital importance to sus-
tainable and resilient communities and to the public

professionals, who are engineers, managers, and employ-
ees of Federal, State, and local government and the pri-
vate sector, and who are responsible for rebuilding, im-
proving, and protecting our Nation’s transportation, 
water supply, water treatment and solid waste systems, 
public buildings, and other structures and facilities essen-
tial for our citizens;
