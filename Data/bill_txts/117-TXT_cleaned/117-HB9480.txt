(1) The San Juan Southern Paiute Tribe is a 
1
federally recognized Indian Tribe that has occupied 
2
its ancestral homelands in northern Arizona and 
3
southern Utah since time immemorial. 
4
(2) The San Juan Southern Paiute Tribe was 
5
federally recognized on December 11, 1989, though 
6
the United States did not create a reservation for its 
7
exclusive benefit at that time. 
8
(3) The Navajo Indian Reservation was origi-
9
nally established by the 1868 Navajo Treaty (15 
10
Stat. 667) and expanded in Arizona and Utah by 
11
various Executive orders and Acts of Congress, in-
12
cluding, but not limited to, Executive order of May 
13
17, 1884; Executive order of January 8, 1900; Pub-
14
lic Law 72–403, 47 Stat. 1418 (1933); and Public 
15
Law 73–352, 48 Stat. 960 (1934). 
16
(4) The Navajo Indian Reservation presently 
17
encompasses lands of the San Juan Southern Paiute 
18
Tribe as described in the Treaty between the Navajo 
19
Nation and the San Juan Southern Paiute Tribe. 
20
(5) While the Dine´ people of the Navajo Nation 
21
and the Paiute people of the San Juan Southern 
22
Paiute Tribe have a long history as neighboring 
23
communities, the San Juan Southern Paiute people

are a separate and culturally distinct Tribe residing 
1
within their ancestral lands. 
2
(6) The existence of the San Juan Southern 
3
Paiute Tribe within the exterior boundaries of the 
4
Navajo Indian Reservation and the lack of an exclu-
5
sive reservation land base causes particular hardship 
6
for the people of the San Juan Southern Paiute 
7
Tribe, preventing the Tribe from providing adequate 
8
housing, infrastructure, healthcare, community serv-
9
ices, and public safety for its people. 
10
(7) The San Juan Southern Paiute Tribe and 
11
the Navajo Nation entered into a Treaty on March 
12
18, 2000 to resolve and clarify the sovereign author-
13
ity of both Tribal nations, to provide a permanent 
14
homeland for the San Juan Southern Paiute Tribe, 
15
and to resolve other matters of mutual concern. 
16
(8) Ratification and approval of the Treaty by 
17
Congress and the execution of the Treaty by the 
18
Secretary is necessary for the Treaty to become ef-
19
fective under its terms. 
20
(9) The establishment and proclamation of the 
21
San Juan Southern Paiute Reservation as author-
22
ized in this Act only includes lands within the exist-
23
ing boundaries of the Navajo Indian Reservation.
