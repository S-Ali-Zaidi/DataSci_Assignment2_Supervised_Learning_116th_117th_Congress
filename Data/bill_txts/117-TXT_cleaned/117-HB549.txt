(1) Between one in four and one in three stu-
1
dents in the United States report being bullied at 
2
school, and over 70 percent of young people say they 
3
have seen bullying in their schools. 
4
(2) Since most instances of bullying take place 
5
on school grounds, school staff and teachers play an 
6
instrumental role in bullying prevention. 
7
(3) Research shows that engaged educators who 
8
are supportive of all students help to reduce the 
9
overall presence of bullying and harassment on 
10
school grounds. 
11
(4) 87.3 percent of transgender students report 
12
feeling unsafe at school, and nine out of ten stu-
13
dents who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
14
transgender, or queer (LGBTQ) report being har-
15
assed and bullied every year. 
16
(5) Hostile school environments have a detri-
17
mental effect on the academic success and health of 
18
students. 
19
(6) Law in effect before the date of the enact-
20
ment of this Act does not sufficiently address bul-
21
lying prevention, and governments and educators in 
22
every State have a responsibility to ensure State and 
23
local education systems have processes in place for 
24
students to be able to learn in a safe environment,
