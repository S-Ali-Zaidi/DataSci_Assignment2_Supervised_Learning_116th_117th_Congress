(1) On December 18, 2014, President Barack 
1
Obama signed an Executive order establishing the 
2
Task Force on 21st Century Policing. The President 
3
charged the task force with identifying best practices 
4
and offering recommendations on how policing prac-
5
tices can promote effective crime reduction while 
6
building public trust. 
7
(2) The task force, which met 7 times in Janu-
8
ary and February of 2015, brought the 11 members 
9
of the task force together with more than 100 indi-
10
viduals from diverse stakeholder groups—police offi-
11
cers and executives, community members, civic lead-
12
ers, advocates, researchers, academics, and others— 
13
in addition to many others who submitted written 
14
testimony to study the problems from all perspec-
15
tives. 
16
(3) The task force recommendations, each with 
17
action items, were organized around six main topic 
18
areas or ‘‘pillars’’, with the first being the Building 
19
Trust and Legitimacy Pillar. 
20
(4) Recommendation 1.7 under the Building 
21
Trust and Legitimacy Pillar found that police de-
22
partments should track the level of trust in police by 
23
their communities just as they measure changes in 
24
crime.
