SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Bayard Rustin was born on March 17, 
8

9
Chester, Pennsylvania. From a young age, Rustin

learned to prioritize the values of nonviolence and 
1
peacekeeping from his grandparents’ Quaker faith, 
2
and would continue to build these values in his life 
3
as a civil rights movement leader. 
4
(2) Rustin attended City College of New York, 
5
where he joined a progressive club that aimed to 
6
remedy racial issues during turbulent times. His 
7
time with the club was short lived, but it inspired 
8
him to join the Fellowship of Reconciliation, an or-
9
ganization that became a champion for labor rights, 
10
equality, and world peace. 
11
(3) His time with the Fellowship of Reconcili-
12
ation prompted Rustin to become a leader in the 
13
1947 ‘‘Journey to Reconciliation’’, an event where 
14
White and Black people across the South rode buses 
15
together to challenge segregation laws, a precursor 
16
to the Freedom Rides. 
17
(4) Rustin was an advisor in Martin Luther 
18
King, Jr.’s inner circle as he advocated pacifism and 
19
nonviolence for achieving equal treatment for Afri-
20
can Americans. 
21
(5) Rustin used his brilliant strategic handling 
22
of the use of aggressive, peaceful action in the civil 
23
rights movement and throughout his life as an activ-
24
ist.

(6) His most important role was as the chief or-
1
ganizer of the 1963 March on Washington, DC, the 
2
largest demonstration ever organized at the time, in 
3
which a quarter of a million people turned out to de-
4
mand civil rights for African Americans. 
5
(7) In the years after the civil rights movement, 
6
Rustin used his background as a gay man to inspire 
7
others to advocate for and to achieve LGBT rights. 
8
(8) Rustin remained a strategist and public 
9
speaker for workers’ rights movements, including co- 
10
founding the A. Philip Randolph Institute for Black 
11
trade union members. 
12
(9) Rustin committed to promoting social good 
13
and advocating for the disenfranchised until his 
14
death in 1987.
