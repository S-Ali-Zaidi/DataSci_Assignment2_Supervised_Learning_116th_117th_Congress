1
CERTAIN NON-PECUNIARY OBJECTIVES.

Section 404(a) of the Employee Retirement Income 
3
Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1104(a)) is amended by

adding at the end the following new paragraph: 
5
‘‘(3) INTEREST BASED ON NON-PECUNIARY FAC-
6
TORS.— 
7
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—For purposes of paragraph 
8
(1), a fiduciary of a plan shall be considered to act 
9
solely in the interest of the participants and bene-
10
ficiaries of the plan with respect to a plan invest-
11
ment or investment course of action only if the fidu-
12
ciary’s action with respect to such investment is 
13
based only on pecuniary factors. The fiduciary may 
14
not subordinate the interests of the participants and 
15
beneficiaries in their retirement income or financial 
16
benefits under the plan to other objectives and may 
17
not sacrifice investment return or take on additional 
18
investment risk to promote non-pecuniary benefits or 
19
goals. The weight given to any pecuniary factor by 
20
a fiduciary should appropriately reflect a prudent as-
21
sessment of the impact of such factor on risk-return.

‘‘(B) INVESTMENT ALTERNATIVES FOR PARTIC-
23
IPANT-DIRECTED INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNT PLANS.—In 
24

prohibited from considering or including an invest-
1
ment option on the basis that such investment op-
2
tion promotes non-pecuniary benefits or goals, pro-

vided that the fiduciary— 
4
‘‘(i) satisfies the requirements of para-
5
graph (1) and subparagraph (A) in considering 
6
or including any such investment option; and 
7
‘‘(ii) does not consider or include such in-
8
vestment option as a default investment (as de-
9
fined in the regulations issued by the Secretary 
10
under subsection (c)(5)(A)), or a component 
11
thereof. 
12
‘‘(C) PECUNIARY FACTOR DEFINED.—For the 
13
purposes of this paragraph, the term ‘pecuniary fac-
14
tor’ means a factor that a fiduciary prudently deter-
15
mines is expected to have a material effect on the 
16
risk and return of an investment based on appro-
17
priate investment horizons consistent with the plan’s 
18
investment objectives and the funding policy estab-
19
lished pursuant to section 402(b)(1).’’.
