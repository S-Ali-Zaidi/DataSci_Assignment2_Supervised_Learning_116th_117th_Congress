A BILL 
To amend the National and Community Service Act of 1990 
to establish a National Climate Service Corps to help 
communities withstand and respond to changes in the 
Earth’s climate with respect to natural disasters, and 
for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘National Climate Serv-
4

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 4220 IH
(1) Every region of the United States is con-
1
fronting the effects of climate change and related 
2
natural disasters, including extreme heat and 
3
droughts, heavy rains and flooding, hurricanes and 
4
tornadoes, acidification of the oceans and sea level 
5
rise, wildfires, and mudslides, among other effects. 
6
(2) These changes affect the health, agriculture, 
7
food supply, infrastructure, energy supply, water 
8
quality and water supply, and have the potential to 
9
reduce the standard of living and quality of life in 
10
the United States. 
11
(3) The Fourth National Climate Assessment 
12
estimates that low-income communities will be dis-
13
proportionately impacted by climate change through 
14
higher rates of adverse health conditions, greater ex-
15
posure to environmental hazards, and more severe 
16
impacts and longer recovery from natural disasters. 
17
(4) The Fourth National Climate Assessment 
18
estimates that— 
19
(A) climate change will shrink the Amer-
20
ican economy by up to 10 percent by the year 
21
2100 
and 
will 
result 
in 
losses 
up 
to 
22
$141,000,000,000 from heat-related deaths, 
23
$118,000,000,000 from sea level rise, and 
24

•HR 4220 IH
$32,000,000,000 from infrastructure damage; 
1
and 
2
(B) proactive adaptation initiatives yield 
3
benefits in excess of their costs in both the near 
4
term and long term. 
5
(5) The frequency and severity of natural disas-
6
ters taking place each year is steadily and signifi-
7
cantly increasing. In 1970, there were 78 registered 
8
natural disasters. In 2017, there were 335 natural 
9
disasters, impacting approximately 96,000,000 peo-
10
ple and costing the United States more than 
11
$306,000,000,000. 
12
(6) Service and Conservation Corps, which are 
13
descended from the Civilian Conservation Corps of 
14
the 1930s, are trained for and have experience with 
15
the four stages of disaster: mitigation, preparedness, 
16
response, and recovery. 
17
(7) During the COVID–19 pandemic, climate 
18
change did not stop. The existing network of 137 
19
Service and Conservation Corps continued to re-
20
spond to the needs of their communities. This in-
21
cluded fighting wildfires to controlling erosion.
