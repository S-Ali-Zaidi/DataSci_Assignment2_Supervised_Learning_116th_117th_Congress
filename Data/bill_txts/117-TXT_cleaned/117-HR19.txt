RESOLUTION 
Condemning and censuring Representative Louie Gohmert 
of Texas. 
Whereas, on January 1, 2021, in a television interview with 
Newsmax, Representative Louie Gohmert stated that in 
response to the dismissal of his Federal lawsuit seeking 
to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, 
‘‘Basically, in effect, the ruling would be that you’ve got 
to go to the streets and be as violent as Antifa and 
BLM.’’; 
Whereas Representative Gohmert has made previous com-
ments insisting the 2020 presidential election had been 
stolen from President Donald Trump and that urged 
Trump’s supporters to consider a ‘‘revolution’’ like the 
2013 Egyptian protests in which hundreds of Egyptians 
died, stating that ‘‘If they can do that there, think of 
what we can do here.’’;

Whereas Representative Gohmert’s comments are contradic-
tory to our longstanding tradition to set aside partisan 
differences and accept electoral outcomes in order to fa-
cilitate a peaceful transition of power; 
Whereas Representative Gohmert’s comments are part of a 
dangerous pattern of signaling to American citizens that 
they should consider using violent means to achieve their 
goals, including overthrowing the results of a legitimate 
democratic election; 
Whereas continued efforts to cast doubt upon the results of 
the 2020 presidential election by espousing conspiracy 
theories and by threatening and inciting violence has the 
potential to lead to tragic consequences, causing irrep-
arable damage toward the people’s faith in our demo-
cratic process; and 
Whereas Representative Gohmert’s comments brought shame 
on the House of Representatives and jeopardized its rep-
utation and institutional integrity: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That— 
1
(1) Representative Louie Gohmert of Texas be 
2
censured; 
3
(2) Representative Louie Gohmert forthwith 
4
present himself in the well of the House of Rep-
5
resentatives for the pronouncement of censure; and 
6
(3) Representative Louie Gohmert be censured 
7
with the public reading of this resolution by the 
8
Speaker.
