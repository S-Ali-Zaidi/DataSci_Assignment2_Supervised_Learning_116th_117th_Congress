land banks, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Transforming Student 
2
Debt to Home Equity Act of 2022’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) In the third quarter of 2021, over 
6
15,185,000 homes remain vacant in the United 
7
States. 
8
(2) These extended vacancies depress neighbor-
9
hood property values and create a downward spiral 
10
in neighborhood stability in already troubled commu-
11
nities. 
12
(3) Meanwhile, due to climbing expenses of 
13
higher education, the total Federal student debt 
14
owed equals $1,750,000,000,000. 
15
(4) More than 44,700,000 Americans have at 
16
least one outstanding student loan. 
17
(5) Student loan repayments are forcing mil-
18
lions of young families to delay purchasing their 
19
first home, as they cannot afford to save for a down-
20
payment or qualify for a mortgage while also paying 
21
off student debt. 
22
(6) Data from the Federal Reserve shows that 
23
non-Hispanic White households have a median net 
24
worth of $181,440, while Black households have a 
25
median net worth of $20,730 and Hispanic house-

holds have $36,180; providing innovative financial 
1
products will allow the United States to reduce the 
2
racial wealth gap and to ensure equitable access to 
3
housing and economic mobility. 
4
(7) The COVID–19 pandemic has exacerbated 
5
the racial wealth gap by increasing unemployment 
6
within already disadvantaged communities and fur-
7
ther reducing access to homeownership and increas-
8
ing the burden of student debt. 
9
(8) According to a report from the Joint Center 
10
for Housing Studies of Harvard University, Black 
11
and Hispanic households are more likely to have 
12
their household income decline and to face hardship 
13
in paying rent and other monthly housing costs due 
14
to the COVID–19 pandemic. 
15
(9) It is imperative to create a demonstration 
16
program to design financial pathways to, where pos-
17
sible, systematically convert some student debt 
18
streams into equity streams through negotiation of 
19
mortgages; otherwise housing purchases will con-
20
tinue to be sluggish among first-time home buyers 
21
and thousands more Americans will enter their mid-
22
years saddled with student loan debt never having 
23
had the opportunity to accumulate equity.

•HR 7368 IH
(10) It is in the interest of the Federal Govern-
1
ment to use the resources at its disposal, including 
2
both housing properties held in trust and student 
3
debt obligations, to put reverse pressure on these 
4
downward trends. 
5
(11) By arranging financing that recalculates 
6
terms, debt-to-income ratios, mortgage interest 
7
rates, and other factors, short-term student debt 
8
could transition into longer-term home ownership. 
9
(12) The goal is to connect creditworthy Fed-
10
eral student debt holders with housing properties for 
11
sale and held by the Federal Government and local 
12
land banks. 
13
(13) Over time, participants can help restore 
14
neighborhoods, transform their debt to equity, and 
15
stabilize secured property values locally and on the 
16
Federal ledger by maintaining and investing in a 
17
home mortgage.
