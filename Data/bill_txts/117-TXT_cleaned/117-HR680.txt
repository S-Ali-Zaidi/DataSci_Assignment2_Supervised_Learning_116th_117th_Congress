United States, for the high crimes and misdemeanors 
of betrayal of the public trust.

1
dent of the United States, is impeached for high crimes 
2
and misdemeanors and that the following Article of Im-
3
peachment be exhibited to the United States Senate: 
4
Article of Impeachment exhibited by the House of 
5
Representatives of the United States of America in the

impeachment against him for high crimes and mis-

demeanors.

ARTICLE I 
3
The Constitution provides that the House of Rep-
4
resentatives ‘‘shall have the sole Power of Impeachment’’ 
5
and that the President ‘‘shall be removed from Office on 
6
Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or 
7
other high Crimes and Misdemeanors’’. In his conduct of 
8
the office of President of the United States—and in viola-
9
tion of his constitutional oath faithfully to execute the of-
10
fice of President of the United States and, to the best of 
11
his ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution 
12
of the United States, and in violation of his constitutional 
13
duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed— 
14
Joseph Robinette Biden, Jr., has willfully abandoned his 
15
duty as President of the United States, in betrayal of the 
16
public trust, in that: 
17
It is the duty of the President as Commander in 
18
Chief to ensure the national security of the United States 
19
of America and its citizens, at home and abroad. 
20
Despite sufficient warning from military and intel-
21
ligence personnel, President Biden proceeded to hap-
22
hazardly withdraw troops from Afghanistan that resulted 
23
in the Taliban gaining full control of Afghanistan and 
24
jeopardized the safety of, and in some cases directly re-

sulted in the death of, United States citizens, United 
1
States Armed Forces members, and Afghan civilians. 
2
The President of the United States willfully aban-
3
doned his duties as Commander in Chief and is directly 
4
responsible for the failed withdrawal from Afghanistan. 
5
The President of the United States gave aid and com-
6
fort to our enemies, while the Taliban rapidly overtook Af-
7
ghanistan. 
8
The President of the United States has compromised 
9
the physical security of tens of thousands of United States 
10
military personnel, United States Government operatives, 
11
United States civilians, Afghan allies, other international 
12
allies, and tens of billions of dollars of advanced United 
13
States military equipment. 
14
On March 25, 2021, President Biden stated, ‘‘if we 
15
leave, we’re going to do so in a safe and orderly way’’ 
16
when asked about withdrawal plans for United States 
17
troops in Afghanistan. 
18
On April 14, 2021, President Biden stated of the 
19
withdrawal of United States troops in Afghanistan, ‘‘We 
20
will not conduct a hasty rush to the exit, we’ll do it respon-
21
sibly, deliberately, and safely’’. 
22
On May 18, 2021, the Department of Defense Inves-
23
tigator General reported a 37-percent increase in reported 
24
attacks initiated by the Taliban on Afghanistan govern-

ment forces during the first quarter of 2021 for ‘‘large- 
1
scale offenses’’. 
2
On June 8, 2021, Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah 
3
Mujahid stated that once foreign forces leave Afghanistan 
4
‘‘we will be compelled to continue our war to achieve our 
5
goal’’. 
6
On June 8, 2021, President Biden transmitted to the 
7
Committee on Armed Services of the House of Represent-
8
atives, the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate, 
9
the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Rep-
10
resentatives, the Committee on Foreign Relations of the 
11
Senate, the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence 
12
of the House of Representatives, and the Select Committee 
13
on Intelligence of the Senate, a waiver of the limitations 
14
under section 1215(a) of the William M. (Mac) Thorn-
15
berry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 
16
2021, which section required a detailed report on the risks 
17
associated with leaving Afghanistan. Such a report would 
18
have provided the details of his administration’s national 
19
security assessment prior to the United States withdrawal 
20
from Afghanistan. 
21
On July 6, 2021, the United States military con-
22
firmed the pullout of Bagram Airfield without notifying 
23
the Afghan commander resulting in the base getting ran-

sacked by Taliban looters and releasing thousands of 
1
ISIS–K terrorists from prison. 
2
On July 8, 2021, President Biden stated that the 
3
Taliban ‘‘is at its strongest militarily since 2001’’ and 
4
stated, ‘‘the likelihood there’s going to be the Taliban 
5
overrunning everything and owning the whole country is 
6
highly unlikely’’. 
7
On July 12, 2021, President Biden ordered 4-star 
8
General Austin Miller, Commander of North Atlantic 
9
Treaty Organization’s Resolute Support Mission and 
10
United States Forces–Afghanistan, to step down from his 
11
position and depart Afghanistan, leaving the remaining 
12
United States presence without a seasoned leader in the 
13
face of growing Taliban powers. 
14
On July 13, 2021, President Biden received a docu-
15
ment signed by 23 staff members of the United States 
16
embassy in Afghanistan, with a warning regarding poten-
17
tial collapse of the Afghan capital of Kabul soon after the 
18
President’s withdrawal deadline. 
19
On August 6, 2021, the Taliban took control of the 
20
Nimroz province. 
21
On August 11, 2021, President Biden took a week- 
22
long vacation at Camp David despite significant advances 
23
and provincial captures by the Taliban offensive.

On August 15, 2021, as Taliban fighters took control 
1
of Kabul, the United States embassy fell, and billions of 
2
dollars of United States military weapons, including 
3
75,000 vehicles, 200 aircraft, 600,000 weapons were given 
4
over to the Taliban. President Biden stated he stood 
5
‘‘squarely behind his decision’’. 
6
On August 16, 2021, President Biden addressed the 
7
Nation on the debacle in Afghanistan and stated, ‘‘I am 
8
president of the United States of America, and the buck 
9
stops with me’’. 
10
On August 20, 2021, President Biden stated that al- 
11
Qaida was ‘‘gone’’ from Afghanistan despite recent reports 
12
from the Inspector General of Congress and the United 
13
Nations that show that al-Qaida continues to have a pres-
14
ence in Afghanistan. 
15
On August 23, 2021, the Chairman of the House 
16
Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence stated that, 
17
‘‘there were any number of warnings that the Taliban 
18
might take over, and some that included a potential of 
19
a very rapid takeover’’. 
20
On August 24, 2021, President Biden stated that he 
21
will not extend the August 31st deadline for withdrawal 
22
of troops from Afghanistan despite pleas from members 
23
of Congress, military personnel, and the G–7 allies. Esti-
24
mates indicated there were 10,000 United States citizens,

•HRES 680 IH 
50,000 Afghan special immigrant visa applicants, and 
1
6,000 troops in Afghanistan at the time. The Pentagon, 
2
however, stated that the United States did not have the 
3
capability to safely escort Americans in Kabul to the air-
4
port for evacuation by the August 31st deadline. 
5
On August 26, 2021, a suicide bomb explosion exe-
6
cuted by terrorist group ISIS–K occurred at Hamid 
7
Karzai International Airport, killing eleven Marines, one 
8
Navy Medic, and one Army soldier, and injuring over 20 
9
Americans. 
10
The last American military service member was re-
11
moved from Afghanistan on August 30, 2021, with hun-
12
dreds of Americans still stranded in Afghanistan. 
13
These executive decisions suggest the willful aban-
14
donment of the national security responsibilities of the 
15
Commander in Chief. It is the responsibility of the Con-
16
gress to reprimand such failure through impeachment. 
17
President Biden promised the American people a re-
18
sponsible, deliberate, and safe exit withdrawal from Af-
19
ghanistan and instead conducted a reckless, politically mo-
20
tivated, and dangerous withdrawal. 
21
President Biden’s conduct during the withdrawal 
22
from Afghanistan has led to international condemnation 
23
of the United States, including from our allies.

•HRES 680 IH 
President Biden’s conduct during the withdrawal has 
1
diminished the United States standing on the inter-
2
national stage, allowing adversaries such as Russia and 
3
China to call into question the United States ability to 
4
fulfill its military and defense commitments. 
5
President Biden’s actions allowed tens of billions of 
6
taxpayer dollars in military equipment, including small 
7
arms, body armor, land vehicles, helicopters, and drones, 
8
to fall into the hands of the Taliban. 
9
President Biden jeopardized the safety of United 
10
States citizens and Afghan allies stranded in Afghanistan 
11
by willingly sharing their identities with Taliban officials. 
12
On July 23, 2021, President Biden colluded with Af-
13
ghan President Ashraf Ghani on a phone call asking him 
14
to mislead the American public and our allies and falsely 
15
portray the status of the war in Afghanistan and betray 
16
the public trust. President Biden explicitly stated ‘‘. . . 
17
as you know and I need not tell you the perception around 
18
the world and in parts of Afghanistan, I believe, is that 
19
things aren’t going well in terms of the fight against the 
20
Taliban. And there’s a need, whether it is true or not, 
21
there is a need to project a different picture’’. 
22
These failures have created a permanent rupture of 
23
trust between this military chain of command and the 
24
American people and our allies.

In doing this, Joseph Robinette Biden, Jr., has will-
1
fully abandoned his duty and betrayed the public trust, 
2
has directly betrayed the public trust and continues to 
3
demonstrate that he is unfit to hold the office of President 
4
of the United States, to the manifest injury of the people 
5
of the United States. 
6
Wherefore President Biden, by such conduct, has 
7
demonstrated that he will remain a threat to national se-
8
curity and the Constitution if allowed to remain in office, 
9
and has acted in a manner grossly incompatible with self- 
10
governance and the rule of law. President Biden thus war-
11
rants impeachment and trial, removal from office, and dis-
12
qualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust, 
13
or profit under the United States.
