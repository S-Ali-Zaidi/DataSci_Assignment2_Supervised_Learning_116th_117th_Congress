RESOLUTION 
Thanking and promoting the profession of perinatal nurses 
by encouraging participation in National Perinatal 
Nurses Week. 
Whereas perinatal nurses work with patients who are at-
tempting to become pregnant, are currently pregnant, or 
have recently delivered; 
Whereas perinatal nurses provide prenatal care and testing, 
care of patients experiencing pregnancy complications, 
care during labor and delivery, and care of patients fol-
lowing delivery; 
Whereas perinatal nursing includes labor and delivery nurses, 
mother-baby nurses, and neonatal nurses; 
Whereas continuous support during labor from a registered 
nurse is critical to achieve improved birth outcomes;

Whereas there has been a persistent shortage of nurses 
across all fields, while demand continues to grow; 
Whereas mothers are dying in the United States at the high-
est rate in the developed world, and the crisis is most se-
vere for Black mothers; 
Whereas nurses are positioned to provide unique insight into 
patient care circumstances that may contribute to wom-
en’s deaths, thereby reducing the rate of, and disparity 
in, maternal mortality; 
Whereas October, the 10th month of the year, was chosen to 
celebrate National Perinatal Nurses Week to represent 
an Apgar score of 10; 
Whereas Apgar is the point system used to evaluate the 
health of a newborn baby, with 10 representing the 
healthiest possible score for a baby, and this score would 
be assigned and recorded by the perinatal nurse attend-
ing the birth; 
Whereas the 10th day of the month of October was chosen 
to begin National Perinatal Nurses Week to represent 10 
centimeters dilated, the measurement used to evaluate a 
woman’s progress in labor, which constitutes complete 
cervical dilation, the successful completion of the first 
phase of labor when a woman is ready to deliver her 
baby, and this progress would be supported and recorded 
by the perinatal nurse attending the birth; and 
Whereas the week of October 10, 2022, through October 17, 
2022, is set aside to celebrate National Perinatal Nurses 
Week to raise public awareness of and celebrate the 
350,000 perinatal nurses who are clinically active in hos-
pitals, perinatal facilities, and health centers: Now, there-
fore, be it
