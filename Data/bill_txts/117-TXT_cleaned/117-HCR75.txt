CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of Congress that the United Nations 
should take immediate procedural actions necessary to 
amend Article 23 of the Charter of the United Nations 
to remove the Russian Federation as a permanent mem-
ber of the United Nations Security Council. 
Whereas the United Nations Security Council is tasked with 
upholding international peace and security among the 
countries of the world; 
Whereas the primary responsibility of the United Nations Se-
curity Council is to determine the existence of a threat

to international peace or act of aggression and to rec-
ommend what necessary action should be taken; 
Whereas Article 39 of the Charter of the United Nations 
states that ‘‘The Security Council shall determine the ex-
istence of any threat to the peace, breach of the peace, 
or act of aggression and shall make recommendations, or 
decide what measures shall be taken in accordance with 
Articles 41 and 42, to maintain or restore international 
peace and security’’; 
Whereas the United Nations Security Council currently has 
five permanent members: the United States of America, 
the United Kingdom, France, the People’s Republic of 
China, and the Russian Federation; 
Whereas the acts of aggression and malign influence by the 
Russian Federation and its proxies in Ukraine are a 
threat to the territorial integrity and democratic sov-
ereignty of Ukraine and run counter to both the letter 
and spirit of the Security Council’s responsibility to 
maintain peace and security; 
Whereas the build-up of nearly 200,000 Russian Federation 
military troops, artillery, tanks, armor, and other military 
equipment on Ukraine’s border since March 2021 has 
significantly threatened the safety, security, stability, and 
sovereignty of Ukraine and has destabilized the security 
of the continent of Europe; 
Whereas, on February 21, 2022, the Russian Federation de-
ployed additional military forces into two Russian-de-
clared separatist regions of eastern Ukraine, which are 
under Ukrainian government control; 
Whereas, on February 22, 2022, Russian Federation Presi-
dent Vladimir Putin recognized the independence of the

two Russian-backed separatist republics in eastern 
Ukraine, the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics, 
and secured parliamentary authorization to deploy addi-
tional Russian forces abroad, setting conditions for a fur-
ther offensive against Ukraine; 
Whereas, on February 24, 2022, Russian Federation Presi-
dent 
Vladimir 
Putin 
launched 
a 
well-coordinated 
disinformation campaign, announcing the start of a ‘‘spe-
cial military operation’’ aimed at the ‘‘demilitarization 
and denazification of Ukraine’’ in order ‘‘to protect the 
people who have been abused by ‘the genocide’ of the 
Kyiv regime for 8 years’’; 
Whereas, on February 24, 2022, the Russian Federation 
launched multiple unprovoked missile strikes in Kyiv, 
Ukraine, as well as in numerous key eastern Ukrainian 
cities, including Kharkiv, Odessa, Mariupol, Dnipro, and 
Kramatorsk, jeopardizing the safety of civilians and with 
the intent to strike Ukrainian military infrastructure, in-
cluding airfields, military depots, air defenses and com-
mand and control sites; and 
Whereas the increased aggression of the Russian Federation 
against the sovereignty of Ukraine has destabilized the 
security of the continent of Europe and could cause mas-
sive casualties, energy shortages, and financial instability 
across the globe: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate 
1
concurring), That Congress—

(1) condemns the Russian Federation’s invasion

of Ukraine’s sovereign territory and its ongoing sup-
4
port of proxy militias in the region, which together
