SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
The Congress finds that: 
2
(1) Robert Parris Moses was born in Harlem, 
3
New York City, on January 23, 1935. 
4
(2) Robert Parris Moses is regarded as an in-
5
fluential civil rights activist, peace activist, public 
6
education advocate, and math literacy educator. 
7
(3) Moses grew up in Harlem River Houses and 
8
was one of only a handful of Black students at the 
9
time who was admitted to Stuyvesant High School. 
10
(4) Moses earned a scholarship to Hamilton 
11
College in Clinton, New York, and subsequently ob-
12
tained a master’s degree in philosophy from Harvard 
13
University in 1957. 
14
(5) His doctorate studies in mathematics were 
15
halted due to the death of his mother and the hos-
16
pitalization of his father. 
17
(6) In 1959, Moses helped with the second 
18
Youth March for Integrated Schools in Washington, 
19
DC. 
20
(7) Moses visited Mississippi in the summer of 
21
1960, and met with local National Association for 
22
the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) lead-
23
ers who indicated the need to focus on voter reg-
24
istration. He returned to Mississippi after teaching 
25
the 1960–1961 school year in New York, where he 
26

organized and registered thousands of poor, illit-
1
erate, and rural Black residents to vote. 
2
(8) As a leader of the Student Nonviolent Co-
3
ordinating Committee, in 1964, Moses helped orga-
4
nize the Mississippi ‘‘Freedom’’ Summer Project. 
5
(9) Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., called Moses’ 
6
‘‘contribution to the freedom struggle in America’’ 
7
an ‘‘inspiration’’. 
8
(10) After Moses married Janet, they started a 
9
family in Tanzania. He spent nearly a decade there 
10
teaching mathematics and working with the Ministry 
11
of Education. 
12
(11) Moses returned to the United States in 
13
1976, and continued his doctoral studies in Philos-
14
ophy of Mathematics at Harvard. He received a 
15
MacArthur Fellowship in 1982, which he used to 
16
promote the Algebra Project. 
17
(12) In founding the Algebra Project, Moses 
18
stated that K–12 math literacy, like voting literacy, 
19
is key to full citizenship for Americans from poor 
20
and minority communities as our society shifts from 
21
the Industrial Age to the Information Age. 
22
(13) The Algebra Project is a non-profit dedi-
23
cated 
to 
helping 
students 
from 
historically 
24
marginalized communities, including Black, Brown, 
25

and youth living in poverty, who often hail from low- 
1
income households. Students develop math literacy 
2
skills, which Bob Moses viewed as the path to per-
3
manently improving their life circumstances, as well 
4
as the social and economic conditions of their com-
5
munities. 
6
(14) The Algebra Project uses mathematics lit-
7
eracy as an organizing tool to guarantee quality pub-
8
lic-school education for all children in the United 
9
States. 
10
(15) The Algebra Project is one of the few 
11
mathematics education initiatives to originate in the 
12
African-American community. 
13
(16) Since its inception in 1982, the Algebra 
14
Project has helped more than 40,000 students in 
15
hundreds of schools nationwide. 
16
(17) In 1996, the Young People’s Project was 
17
launched by Algebra Project graduates from Cam-
18
bridge, MA, and Algebra Project middle school stu-
19
dents from Jackson, Mississippi. The Young Peo-
20
ple’s Project recruits and trains high school and col-
21
lege age ‘‘Math Literacy Workers’’ to facilitate en-
22
richment workshops for younger students in mathe-
23
matics.

(18) For his work, Bob Moses has been hon-
1
ored, including with an Honorary Doctor of Science 
2
from Harvard University and Ohio State University, 
3
an Honorary Doctor of Laws from Princeton Uni-
4
versity, the John Dewey Prize for Progressive Edu-
5
cation, a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Na-
6
tional Council of the Teachers of Mathematics, and 
7
was inducted to the American Academy of Arts and 
8
Sciences. 
9
(19) Moses wrote about his vision for education 
10
and experiences. He was co-author of Radical Equa-
11
tions–Civil Rights from Mississippi to the Algebra 
12
Project (2001), and co-editor of Quality Education 
13
as a Constitutional Right–Creating a Grassroots 
14
Movement to Transform America’s Schools (2010). 
15
(20) Moses wrote in Radical Equations that 
16
‘‘the most urgent social issue affecting poor people 
17
and people of color, is economic access. In today’s 
18
world, economic access and full citizenship depend 
19
crucially on math and science literacy. I believe that 
20
the absence of math literacy in urban and rural com-
21
munities throughout this country is an issue as ur-
22
gent as the lack of registered Black voters in Mis-
23
sissippi was in 1961.’’.
