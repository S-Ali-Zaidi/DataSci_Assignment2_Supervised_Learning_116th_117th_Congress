SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Federal unions play a critical role in pro-
3
tecting the rights of Federal workers by allowing 
4
members to have a collective voice on the job and in 
5
the legislative process, advance issues for working 
6
families, ensure equal opportunities for all workers, 
7
and raise the standards by which all professional 
8
and technical workers are employed. 
9
(2) Collective bargaining is essential to the 
10
union process, because it provides mutual agreement 
11
between all parties that fosters harmonious relation-
12
ships between the Federal Government and its em-
13
ployees and protects the interest of both parties. 
14
(3) The current administration has acted 
15
through Executive orders and official memorandums 
16
to dismantle Federal unions and undermine their 
17
collective bargaining rights across the Federal work-
18
force and these directives have already negatively 
19
impacted labor contracts, both signed and under ac-
20
tive negotiation. 
21
(4) These orders set an aggressive schedule for 
22
unions to engage in collective bargaining, while also 
23
slashing the unions official time for performing 
24
union duties by over 91 percent in some cases. 
25
These actions are limiting the ability for unions to

•HR 249 IH
prepare for negotiations and perform their legally re-
1
quired employee representational duties. 
2
(5) Section 7101(a) of title 5, United States 
3
Code, states, ‘‘Congress finds that labor organiza-
4
tions and collective bargaining in the civil service are 
5
in the public interest.’’. Attempting to eliminate the 
6
union by eliminating almost all its official time repu-
7
diates the statutory position that unions are in the 
8
public interest. 
9
(6) Through these orders, agencies are required 
10
to comply with artificial bargaining schedules, which 
11
undermine good faith negotiations and divert the de-
12
cision making to an impasse panel, which has no 
13
union representation on it and does not represent 
14
both parties. 
15
(7) Collectively, the administration’s actions 
16
have violated Congressional intent, undermined the 
17
ability of unions to engage in collective bargaining, 
18
blocked successful diversity and inclusion training 
19
programs, and threatened the rights and benefits of 
20
millions of Federal workers.
