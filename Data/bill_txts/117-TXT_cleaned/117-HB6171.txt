1
2461 et seq.) to assist such countries in meeting the 
2
eligibility criteria under such program;

standards and improve the well-being of individuals 
5
in the beneficiary developing countries through trade 
6
and economic development;

(3) trade policies cannot create a race to the 
8

11
under subsection (d) of section 502 of the Trade Act 
12
of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2462(d)), the President should, 
13
in a manner consistent with statutory require-
14
ments— 
15
(A) consider the impact of withdrawal, sus-
16
pension, or limitation of duty-free treatment on 
17
the criteria and factors affecting eligibility de-
18
scribed in subsections (b) and (c) of such sec-
19
tion; and 
20
(B) take all available steps to facilitate 
21

22

23
or reverse progress made toward meeting the 
24
criteria and factors described in subsections (b)

nomic harm to United States entities, particu-

the harm for products determined to meet the cri-
6
teria and factors described in subsections (b) and (c) 
7
of section 502 of the Trade Act of 1974, including

exploring the feasibility of preserving duty-free eligi-

bility on a case-by-case basis for qualifying compa-
10
nies if the President decides to withdraw, suspend, 
11
or limit the application of the duty-free treatment
