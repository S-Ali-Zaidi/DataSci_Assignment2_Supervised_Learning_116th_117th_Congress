SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
The Congress finds that— 
2
(1) housing should be considered a critical com-
3
ponent of our national infrastructure; 
4
(2) existing shortages of affordable housing op-
5
tions in many regions are contributing to long com-
6
mutes, financial stress, environmental pollution, and 
7
public health risk; 
8
(3) new approaches in the planning, design, and 
9
construction of housing need to be explored for di-
10
versifying housing options available to the workforce; 
11
and 
12
(4) greater coordination of existing Federal re-
13
sources across agencies could significantly expand 
14
and diversify the supply of housing.
