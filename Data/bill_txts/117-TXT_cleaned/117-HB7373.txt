Congress finds the following:

(1) Supply chain disruptions have made it dif-
1
ficult for schools to get sufficient meals and supplies 
2
needed to serve lunches to students. 
3
(2) School food authorities are going the extra 
4
mile to provide students with nutritious meals, given 
5
the ongoing supply chain issues. 
6
(3) In a 2021 survey of school nutrition direc-
7
tors, 97 percent expressed concerns with continued 
8
pandemic supply chain disruptions, with 65 percent 
9
citing this as a serious concern. 
10
(4) Eligible children should be spared the harm-
11
ful consequences of current supply chain shortages 
12
by receiving school-based meals. 
13
(5) School food authorities should have the nec-
14
essary flexibilities to address supply chain shortages. 
15
(6) School food authorities should receive full 
16
meal reimbursement for meals provided when im-
17
pacted by supply chain delays beyond their control. 
18
(7) School food authorities have achieved ex-
19
traordinary success in keeping children fed through-
20
out the pandemic. They should be recognized for this 
21
service and supported in ongoing work. 
22
(8) Due to the uncertainty of supply chains and 
23
inflation, school food authorities should have the

ability to apply for waivers retroactively, recognizing 
1
disruptions may occur as late as the day of service. 
2
(9) Before the pandemic, summer meal sites 
3
were required to serve meals at a defined location, 
4
also known as congregate meals. Due to the pan-
5
demic, sites and schools were allowed to serve non- 
6
congregate meals, meaning parents could pick up 
7
meals or organizations could drop off multiple meals 
8
at a child’s home. 
9
(10) Non-congregate waivers for summer meals 
10
made it easier for school food authorities to feed eli-
11
gible kids during the summer months. Allowing non- 
12
congregate waivers for the summer of 2022 will give 
13
school food authorities the stability they need to feed 
14
eligible kids for the remainder of the summer.
