(1) The name of a professional sports team al-
1
ways is linked to the name of the community in 
2
which the team is located. 
3
(2) Communities, sports fans, and taxpayers 
4
make a substantial and valuable financial, psycho-
5
logical, and emotional investment in professional 
6
sports teams and names of teams. 
7
(3) Communities receive substantial tax reve-
8
nues and employment opportunities from the oper-
9
ation of professional sports teams. 
10
(4) The public, through a municipal stadium or 
11
arena authority (which may be a city or county 
12
agency or a municipal corporation), often authorizes 
13
capital construction bonds to build a stadium or 
14
arena for a professional sports team, while the lease 
15
or use agreement generally sets rent to cover only 
16
operating costs of the stadium or arena without re-
17
imbursing the public for construction costs. 
18
(5) A professional sports team that wishes to 
19
relocate the operations of the team to another area 
20
should take into account the social and community 
21
needs of the community in which the team operates. 
22
(6) Professional sports teams promote civic 
23
pride and generate jobs, revenue, and other local 
24
economic development.

(7) Professional sports teams remain in com-
1

4
sports fans or the interests of communities when 
5
professional sports teams decide to relocate. 
6
(9) Owners of professional sports teams have 
7
opportunities to extract enormous benefits from 
8
communities and owners take advantage of those op-
9
portunities.
