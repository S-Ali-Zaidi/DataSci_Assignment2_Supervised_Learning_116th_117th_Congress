SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Since the colonial era, African Americans 
3
have served the United States in times of war. 
4
(2) During the Civil War, approximately 
5
200,000 African-American men served in the Union 
6
Army and 19,000 African-American men served in 
7
the Union Navy. 
8
(3) During the Civil War, African-American 
9
women were not allowed to formally enlist as soldiers 
10
or sailors, though they served as nurses, cooks, 
11
spies, and scouts for the Union Army and the Union 
12
Navy. 
13
(4) While African-American men served in the 
14
Navy since its establishment, there was resistance to 
15
enlisting them to take up arms for the Union Army 
16
at the start of the Civil War. 
17
(5) As the Civil War dragged on, President 
18
Lincoln broke from the previous policy of his admin-
19
istration and determined that liberating enslaved 
20
persons ‘‘was a military necessity absolutely essen-
21
tial for the salvation of the Union’’. 
22
(6) The Act entitled ‘‘An Act to suppress insur-
23
rection, to punish treason and rebellion, to seize and 
24
confiscate the property of rebels, and for other pur-
25
poses’’, approved July 17, 1862 (commonly known 
26
22:59 Mar 01, 2022
H6816

•HR 6816 IH
as the ‘‘Second Confiscation Act’’) (12 Stat. 589; 
1
chapter 195), and the Act of July 17, 1862 (com-
2
monly known as the ‘‘Military Act of 1862’’) (12 
3
Stat. 597; chapter 201), were the first official au-
4
thorizations to employ African Americans in the 
5
Union Army. 
6
(7) It was not until January 1, 1863, the effec-
7
tive date of the Emancipation Proclamation issued 
8
by President Lincoln, that the Union Army was or-
9
dered to receive African-American men. 
10
(8) On May 22, 1863, the United States War 
11
Department issued General Order Number 143, 
12
which established the Bureau of Colored Troops for 
13
the recruitment and organization of regiments of the 
14
Union Army composed of African-American men, 
15
called the United States Colored Troops (referred to 
16
in this section as ‘‘USCT’’). 
17
(9) Leaders such as Frederick Douglass encour-
18
aged African Americans to enlist to advance the 
19
cause of citizenship. ‘‘Once let the black man get 
20
upon his person the brass letters, ‘U.S.’, let him get 
21
an eagle on his button, and a musket on his shoul-
22
der and bullets in his pocket, there is no power on 
23
[E]arth that can deny that he has earned the right 
24
to citizenship.’’, wrote Douglass.

(10) African-American sailors constituted a sig-
1
nificant segment of the Union Navy, making up 20 
2
percent of the total enlisted force of the Navy. 
3
(11) Although there were rank restrictions on 
4
African Americans in the Navy before the Civil War, 
5
this policy changed after the establishment of the 
6
USCT, when the Union Navy started to compete 
7
with the Union Army for enlistment of African 
8
Americans. 
9
(12) Yet, in practice, most African Americans 
10
could not advance beyond lowest ranks of ‘‘boy’’ and 
11
‘‘landsman.’’ 
12
(13) African-American soldiers and sailors 
13
served with distinction, honor, and bravery amid ra-
14
cial discrimination and adverse circumstances, in-
15
cluding the risk of enslavement and torture if cap-
16
tured. 
17
(14) Eighteen members of the USCT and 8 Af-
18
rican-American sailors were awarded the Medal of 
19
Honor, the highest honor in the United States for 
20
bravery in combat. 
21
(15) For generations after the Civil War, the 
22
contributions of African Americans in the Civil War 
23
were excluded from historical memory.

(16) Public Law No. 102–412 (106 Stat. 2104) 
1
authorized the establishment of a memorial on Fed-
2
eral land in the District of Columbia to honor Afri-
3
can Americans who served with Union forces during 
4
the Civil War. 
5
(17) This memorial, featuring a bronze statue 
6
of USCT soldiers, an African-American sailor and 
7
family, is surrounded by the Wall of Honor, which 
8
lists the names of the members of the USCT. 
9
(18) The African American Civil War Museum 
10
is located in the District of Columbia. 
11
(19) Patriots and heroes who rose in service to 
12
a Nation that would not fully recognize them, the 
13
African Americans who served the Union during the 
14
Civil War deserve our recognition for their contribu-
15
tions to the grant of emancipation and citizenship 
16
for nearly 4,000,000 enslaved people and the preser-
17
vation of the Union.
