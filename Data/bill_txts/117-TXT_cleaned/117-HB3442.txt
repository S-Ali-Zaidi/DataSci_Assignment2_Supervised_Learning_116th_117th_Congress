Congress finds that— 
7
(1) in 2018, the Forest Service Fire Modeling 
8
Institute determined that 63,070,000 acres of Na-
9
tional Forest System land and 171,200,000 acres of 
10
other forest land were at high or very high risk of 
11
experiencing a wildfire that would be difficult to sup-
12

(2) according to the National Interagency Co-
1
ordination Center, between 2009 and 2018, in the 
2
United States, on average— 
3
(A) 67,000 wildfires burned 7,000,000 
4
acres annually; and 
5
(B) 86,345 prescribed fires burned only 
6
3,000,000 acres annually; 
7
(3) indigenous communities have used con-
8
trolled burns to manage landscapes since time imme-
9
morial; 
10
(4) according to the National Interagency Co-
11
ordination Center, the annual cost of suppressing 
12
wildfires in a State with an active prescribed burn-
13
ing program is less than 1 percent of the annual 
14
cost of suppressing wildfires in a State without an 
15
active prescribed burning program, despite each 
16
State having the same number of wildfires; 
17
(5) according to a 2017 study published in the 
18
Journal of Forestry, on a given acre, a prescribed 
19
fire burning in April or May produces less than 1⁄5 
20
of the smoke emissions of a wildfire that would burn 
21
on that acre in August; 
22
(6) according to a 2019 study conducted by 
23
Stanford University, smoke from prescribed fires ex-

poses children to fewer negative health effects than 
1
the detrimental smoke generated by wildfires; 
2
(7) according to a 2015 study published in 
3
Ecology, trees that have not been burnt by a low-in-
4
tensity fire are unusually prone to bark beetle at-
5
tacks, and between 2000 and 2010, bark beetles 
6
killed the majority of trees on 32,000,000 acres of 
7
the 193,000,000 acres of National Forest System 
8
land; 
9
(8) as of September 30, 2019, there were— 
10
(A) 37 prescribed fire councils in 33 
11
States; and 
12
(B) 64 prescribed burn associations in 11 
13
States; 
14
(9) according to the 2018 National Prescribed 
15
Fire Use Survey Report— 
16
(A) 37 States regulate prescribed fires by 
17
issuing burn permits; 
18
(B) 23 States offer prescribed burn man-
19
ager certification courses to facilitate respon-
20
sible burning on private land; 
21
(C) only 5 States (Vermont, Massachu-
22
setts, Missouri, Connecticut, and Rhode Island) 
23
lack laws to reduce liability associated with the 
24
responsible use of prescribed fire; and

(D) only 8 States (Florida, Montana, Ne-

2
lina, and Washington) have laws that use a 
3
standard of gross negligence for determining li-
4
abilities for the responsible use of prescribed 
5
fire; and
