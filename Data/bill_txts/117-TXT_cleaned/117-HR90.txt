tors in response to their decisions to warn other Chinese

information on COVID–19 on WeChat; 
Whereas, on January 1, 2020, the Hubei Provincial Health 
Commission ordered laboratories to stop testing for

Whereas, on January 2, 2020, the Wuhan Institute of Virol-

Whereas the Government of the People’s Republic of China 
argues that COVID–19 did not originate in the People’s 
Republic of China; 
Whereas the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People’s Re-
public of China has alleged that the United States Army 
may have delivered COVID–19 to the city of Wuhan and 
that COVID–19 may have originated in Italy or ‘‘sepa-
rate outbreaks in multiple places in the world’’; 
Whereas the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People’s Re-
public of China has said, ‘‘China’s endeavor to combating 
[sic] the epidemic has bought time for [international]

ographic spread of COVID–19;

tion of the origins of COVID–19; and

cess by investigators to certain locations and information
