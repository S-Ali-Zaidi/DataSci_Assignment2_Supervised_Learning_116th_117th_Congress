the payment of wages on the basis of sex, and for other 
purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Women have entered the workforce in 
3
record numbers over the past 50 years. 
4
(2) Despite the enactment of the Equal Pay Act 
5
of 1963, many women continue to earn significantly 
6
lower pay than men for equal work. These pay dis-
7
parities exist in both the private and governmental 
8
sectors. Pay disparities are especially severe for 
9
women and girls of color. 
10
(3) In many instances, the pay disparities can 
11
only be due to continued intentional discrimination 
12
or the lingering effects of past discrimination. After 
13
controlling for educational attainment, occupation, 
14
industry, union status, race, ethnicity, and labor 
15
force experience roughly 40 percent of the pay gap 
16
remains unexplained. 
17
(4) The existence of such pay disparities— 
18
(A) depresses the wages of working fami-
19
lies who rely on the wages of all members of the 
20
family to make ends meet; 
21
(B) undermines women’s retirement secu-
22
rity, which is often based on earnings while in 
23
the workforce; 
24
20:55 Jan 29, 2021
H7

•HR 7 IH
(C) prevents women from realizing their 
1
full economic potential, particularly in terms of 
2
labor force participation and attachment; 
3
(D) has been spread and perpetuated, 
4
through commerce and the channels and instru-
5
mentalities of commerce, among the workers of 
6
the several States; 
7
(E) burdens commerce and the free flow of 
8
goods in commerce; 
9
(F) constitutes an unfair method of com-
10
petition in commerce; 
11
(G) tends to cause labor disputes, as evi-
12
denced by the tens of thousands of charges filed 
13
with the Equal Employment Opportunity Com-
14
mission against employers between 2010 and 
15
2016; 
16
(H) interferes with the orderly and fair 
17
marketing of goods in commerce; and 
18
(I) in many instances, may deprive workers 
19
of equal protection on the basis of sex in viola-
20
tion of the 5th and 14th Amendments to the 
21
Constitution. 
22
(5)(A) Artificial barriers to the elimination of 
23
discrimination in the payment of wages on the basis 
24
of sex continue to exist decades after the enactment 
25
20:55 Jan 29, 2021

•HR 7 IH
of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 
1
201 et seq.) and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 
2
U.S.C. 2000a et seq.). 
3
(B) These barriers have resulted, in significant 
4
part, because the Equal Pay Act of 1963 has not 
5
worked as Congress originally intended. Improve-
6
ments and modifications to the law are necessary to 
7
ensure that the Act provides effective protection to 
8
those subject to pay discrimination on the basis of 
9
their sex. 
10
(C) Elimination of such barriers would have 
11
positive effects, including— 
12
(i) providing a solution to problems in the 
13
economy created by unfair pay disparities; 
14
(ii) substantially reducing the number of 
15
working women earning unfairly low wages, 
16
thereby reducing the dependence on public as-
17
sistance; 
18
(iii) promoting stable families by enabling 
19
all family members to earn a fair rate of pay; 
20
(iv) remedying the effects of past discrimi-
21
nation on the basis of sex and ensuring that in 
22
the future workers are afforded equal protection 
23
on the basis of sex; and 
24

(v) ensuring equal protection pursuant to

Congress’ power to enforce the 5th and 14th 
2
Amendments to the Constitution. 
3
(6) The Department of Labor and the Equal 
4
Employment Opportunity Commission carry out 
5
functions to help ensure that women receive equal 
6
pay for equal work. 
7
(7) The Department of Labor is responsible 
8
for— 
9
(A) collecting and making publicly avail-
10
able information about women’s pay; 
11
(B) ensuring that companies receiving 
12
Federal contracts comply with anti-discrimina-
13
tion affirmative action requirements of Execu-
14
tive Order 11246 (relating to equal employment 
15
opportunity); 
16
(C) disseminating information about wom-
17
en’s rights in the workplace; 
18
(D) helping women who have been victims 
19
of pay discrimination obtain a remedy; and 
20
(E) investigating and prosecuting systemic 
21
gender based pay discrimination involving gov-
22
ernment contractors.

24

4
ment of Labor and the Equal Employment Oppor-

6
of the amendments made by this Act, wage data,

and more effective remedies, will ensure that women 
8
are better able to recognize and enforce their rights.

(10) Certain employers have already made 
10
great strides in eradicating unfair pay disparities in 
11
the workplace and their achievements should be rec-
12
ognized.
