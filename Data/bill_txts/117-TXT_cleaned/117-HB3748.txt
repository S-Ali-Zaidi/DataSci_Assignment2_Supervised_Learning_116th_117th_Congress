SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
10
It is the sense of Congress that— 
11
(1) agencies should optimize data collection, 
12
management, and dissemination, to the extent prac-
13
ticable, to maximize their impact for research, com-
14
mercial, regulatory, and educational benefits and to 
15
foster innovation, scientific discoveries, the develop-
16
ment of commercial products, and the development 
17
of sound policy with respect to the Great Lakes, 
18
oceans, bays, estuaries, and coasts; 
19
(2) agencies should consider current and future 
20
needs relating to supercomputing capacity, data 
21
storage capacity, and public access, address gaps in 
22
those areas, and coordinate across agencies as need-
23
ed;

emy of Sciences shall conduct a comprehensive as-
2
sessment of the need for and feasibility of estab-
3
lishing an Advanced Research Projects Agency– 
4
Oceans (ARPA–O) that operates in coordination 
5
with and with nonduplication of existing Federal 
6
oceanic research programs, including programs of 
7
the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research of 
8
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administra-

tion.

(2) ELEMENTS.—The comprehensive assess-
11
ment carried out pursuant to paragraph (1) shall in-
12
clude— 
13
(A) an assessment of how an ARPA–O 
14
could help overcome the long-term and high-risk 
15
technological barriers in the development of 
16
ocean technologies, with the goal of enhancing 
17
the economic, ecological, and national security 
18
of the United States through the rapid develop-
19
ment of technologies that result in— 
20
(i) improved data collection, moni-
21
toring, and prediction of the ocean environ-
22
ment, including sea ice conditions; 
23
(ii) overcoming barriers to the appli-
24
cation of new and improved technologies,

such as high costs and scale of operational 
1
missions; 
2
(iii) improved management practices 
3
for protecting ecological sustainability; 
4
(iv) improved national security capac-
5
ity; 
6
(v) improved technology for fishery 
7
population assessments; 
8
(vi) expedited processes between and 
9
among Federal agencies to successfully 
10
identify, transition, and coordinate re-
11
search and development output to oper-
12
ations, applications, commercialization, and 
13
other uses; and 
14
(vii) ensuring that the United States 
15
maintains a technological lead in devel-
16
oping and deploying advanced ocean tech-
17
nologies; 
18
(B) an evaluation of the organizational 
19
structures under which an ARPA–O could be 
20
organized, which takes into account— 
21
(i) best practices for new research 
22
programs; 
23
(ii) consolidation and reorganization 
24
of existing Federal oceanic programs to ef-

fectuate coordination and nonduplication of 
1
such programs; 
2
(iii) metrics and approaches for peri-
3
odic program evaluation; 
4
(iv) capacity to fund and manage ex-
5
ternal research awards; and 
6
(v) options for oversight of the activ-
7
ity through a Federal agency, an inter-
8
agency organization, nongovernmental or-
9
ganization, or other institutional arrange-
10
ment; and 
11
(C) an estimation of the scale of invest-
12
ment necessary to pursue high priority ocean 
13
technology projects. 
14
(c) REPORT.—Not later than 18 months after the 
15
date of the enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall 
16
submit to Congress a report on the comprehensive assess-
17
ment conducted under subsection (b).
