SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Severing Putin’s Im-

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
5
Congress makes the following findings: 
6
(1) In February 2022, the Russian Federation 
7
launched a large scale invasion of Ukraine that vio-
8
lated Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. 
9
(2) In 2021, the Russian Federation became 
10
the second-largest exporter of crude oil and petro-
11
leum products to the United States, after Canada. 
12
(3) In 2020, 7 percent of all petroleum imports 
13
to the United States came from the Russian Federa-
14
tion, which is more than was imported from the 
15
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. 
16
(4) The United States private sector imported 
17
848,000 barrels of oil from the Russian Federation 
18
per day in June 2021. 
19
(5) From January through December 2021, the 
20
United States imported 245,194,000 barrels of oil 
21
from the Russian Federation, which at an annual 
22
average of $71 per barrel equals approximately 
23
$17,400,000,000 in oil imports. 
24
(6) As of February 2022, oil prices have risen 
25
to $92 per barrel.

(7) According to the Ministry of Finance of the 
1
Russian Federation, 36 percent of all revenue of the 
2
Government of the Russian Federation came from 
3
the oil and gas sector in 2021. In 2019 and 2020, 
4
the overall percentage of revenue of that Govern-
5
ment that came from the oil and gas sector reached 
6
39 and 28 percent, respectively. 
7
(8) The President of the Russian Federation, 
8
Vladimir Putin, relies on a network of government 
9
officials, heads of state-owned enterprises, and busi-
10
ness leaders to maintain his grasp on power. 
11
(9) Russian-owned energy entities that have ties 
12
to individuals aligned with Putin see benefits from 
13
reliance by the United States on imports of crude oil 
14
and petroleum products from the Russian Federa-
15
tion. 
16
(10) In early 2021, political prisoner Alexei 
17
Navalny’s 
Anti-Corruption 
Foundation 
outlined 
18
some of the corrupt linkages between Russian oil 
19
giant Rosneft, with key Putin ally Igor Sechin as its 
20
head, and Vladimir Putin himself. 
21
(11) The United States Government has al-
22
ready taken action against individuals with links to 
23
the energy sector of the Russian Federation, such as 
24
Igor Sechin, Boris and Arkady Rotenberg, Kirill

(A) the Global Magnitsky Human Rights 
3
Accountability Act (subtitle F of title XII of 
4
Public Law 114–328; 22 U.S.C. 2656 note); 
5
(B) Executive Orders 13661 and 13662 
6
(50 U.S.C. 1701 note; relating to blocking 
7
property of additional persons contributing to 
8
the situation in Ukraine), codified by section 
9
222 of the Countering America’s Adversaries 
10
Through Sanctions Act (22 U.S.C. 9522); and 
11
(C) Executive Order 13582 (50 U.S.C. 
12
1701 note; relating to blocking property of the 
13
Government of Syria and prohibiting certain 
14
transactions with respect to Syria). 
15
(12) While sanctions imposed by the United 
16
States in response to the Russian Federation’s war 
17
of aggression against Ukraine have largely exempted 
18
the energy sector, on February 24, 2022, the United 
19
States Government announced action against the fol-
20
lowing 2 additional individuals with links to that sec-
21
tor: 
22
(A) Ivan Sechin, son of Igor Sechin, and 
23
reportedly a deputy head of a department at 
24
Rosneft.

of

Gazprom Neft, and son of Nikolai Platonovich

Patrushev, the Secretary of the Russian Secu-

4
(13) Despite ongoing United States imports of 
5
crude oil and petroleum products from the Russian 
6
Federation and existing laws and policies against 
7
supporting human rights abuses, there has been no 
8
United States Government-led analysis of the link-
9
ages between the energy sector of the Russian Fed-
10
eration and corruption or human rights abuses. 
11
(14) Oil imported from the Russian Federation 
12
contributes to the overall United States carbon foot-
13
print, which makes up nearly 15 percent of all global 
14
greenhouse gas emissions. 
15
(15) On January 27, 2021, President Joseph 
16
R. Biden issued Executive Order 14008 (86 Fed. 
17
Reg. 7619; relating to tackling the climate crisis at 
18
home and abroad), which identifies climate change 
19
as an essential element of the foreign policy and na-
20
tional security strategy of the United States. 
21
(16) The Department of Defense cites climate 
22
change as a national security threat, noting that 100 
23
percent of geographic combatant commands were af-
24
fected by climate-related impacts in 2019, and more

than 1,700 military installations continue to be 
1
threatened by sea-level rise. Extreme weather events 
2
have caused more than $796,100,000,000 in damage 
3
in the United States during the 5 years before the 
4
date of the enactment of this Act alone. 
5
(17) President Biden has set an economy-wide 
6
target for the United States to reduce its net green-
7
house gas emissions by 50 to 52 percent below 2005 
8
levels by 2030, which will require decarbonization in 
9
the energy, buildings, and transportation sectors. 
10
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
11
It is a sense of Congress that— 
12
(1) the reliance of the United States on oil im-
13
ported from the Russian Federation presents a na-
14
tional security liability; 
15
(2) a prohibition on imports of oil from the 
16
Russian Federation could deprive the Russian Fed-
17
eration upwards of $20,000,000,000 or more rev-
18
enue from the United States in 2022; 
19
(3) Russian energy entities are controlled by 
20
Russian executives and oligarchs with close ties to 
21
Vladimir Putin, and profits from the energy sector 
22
may be implicated in corruption and in fueling 
23
human rights abuses globally and in the Russian 
24
Federation; 
25

•HR 6953 IH
(4) the United States Government must— 
1
(A) investigate the links described in para-
2
graph (2) to avoid funding activities tied to 
3
human rights abuses and corruption through 
4
the purchase of oil imported from the Russian 
5
Federation; 
6
(B) develop a comprehensive strategy to 
7
replace oil imported from the Russian Federa-
8
tion with domestic carbon-free energy sources; 
9
and 
10
(C) invest in renewable energy alternatives 
11
to replace foreign carbon-intensive energy im-
12
ports; and 
13
(5) actively decarbonizing the United States en-
14
ergy economy is of vital strategic interest to the na-
15
tional security and climate change reduction targets

of the United States.

3
(4) identifying the ways in which revenue gen-
