A BILL 
To amend the Public Health Service Act to ensure that 
non-animal methods are prioritized, where applicable and 
feasible, in proposals for all research to be conducted 
or supported by the National Institutes of Health, and 
for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Humane and Existing 
4
Alternatives in Research and Testing Sciences Act of 
5
2021’’ or the ‘‘HEARTS Act of 2021’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The National Institutes of Health has sup-
3
ported life-saving research that has greatly improved 
4
the health and well-being not only of Americans but 
5
also of people around the world. 
6
(2) Much of this research has relied on animals. 
7
It is estimated that between 17 million and 22 mil-
8
lion animals are used annually in the United States 
9
in research, education, and testing. 
10
(3) At the same time, however, a great deal of 
11
research that utilized animal studies yielded no ben-
12
efits for humans. For example, according to NIH 
13
itself, ‘‘approximately 30 percent of promising medi-
14
cations have failed in human clinical trials because 
15
they are found to be toxic despite promising pre-clin-
16
ical studies in animal models. About 60 percent of 
17
candidate drugs fail due to lack of efficacy’’. 
18
(4) The laboratory use of animals has also long 
19
been an issue of public concern because animals will, 
20
in most cases, experience fear, pain, disease or sur-
21
gery, and early death. 
22
(5) Much more has become known about the 
23
unsuitability of animal models for studying human 
24
disease and many more humane, cost-effective, and 
25

•HR 4101 IH
scientifically suitable non-animal methods are avail-
1
able. 
2
(6) Under the system of oversight established 
3
by the Animal Welfare Act (Public Law 89–544), re-
4
searchers are supposed to consider alternatives to 
5
animal use or painful procedures and should not un-
6
necessarily duplicate previous experiments. However, 
7
oversight is generally weak and little heed is paid to 
8
the use of non-animal methods or the avoidance of 
9
duplication, thereby unnecessarily subjecting animals 
10
to pain, suffering, and death. 
11
(7) A system of active incentives is needed to 
12
encourage researchers to utilize humane, cost-effec-
13
tive, and scientifically suitable non-animal methods.
