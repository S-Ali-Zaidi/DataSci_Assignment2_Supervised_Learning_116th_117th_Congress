SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

‘‘CROWN Act of 2021’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS; PURPOSE. 
5
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) Throughout United States history, society 
7
has used (in conjunction with skin color) hair tex-
8
ture and hairstyle to classify individuals on the basis 
9
of race. 
10
(2) Like one’s skin color, one’s hair has served 
11
as a basis of race and national origin discrimination. 
12
(3) Racial and national origin discrimination 
13
can and do occur because of longstanding racial and 
14
national origin biases and stereotypes associated 
15
with hair texture and style. 
16
(4) For example, routinely, people of African 
17
descent are deprived of educational and employment 
18
opportunities because they are adorned with natural 
19
or protective hairstyles in which hair is tightly coiled 
20
or tightly curled, or worn in locs, cornrows, twists, 
21
braids, Bantu knots, or Afros. 
22
(5) Racial and national origin discrimination is 
23
reflected in school and workplace policies and prac-
24
tices that bar natural or protective hairstyles com-
25
monly worn by people of African descent. 
26

•HR 2116 IH
(6) For example, as recently as 2018, the 
1
United States Armed Forces had grooming policies 
2
that barred natural or protective hairstyles that 
3
servicemembers of African descent commonly wear 
4
and that described these hairstyles as ‘‘unkempt’’. 
5
(7) The United States Army also recognized 
6
that prohibitions against natural or protective hair-
7
styles that African-American soldiers are commonly 
8
adorned with are racially discriminatory, harmful, 
9
and bear no relationship to African-American serv-
10
icewomen’s occupational qualifications and their 
11
ability to serve and protect the Nation. As of Feb-
12
ruary 2021, the United States Army removed min-
13
imum hair length requirements and lifted restric-
14
tions on any soldier wearing braids, twists, locs, and 
15
cornrows in order to promote inclusivity and accom-
16
modate the hair needs of soldiers. 
17
(8) As a type of racial or national origin dis-
18
crimination, discrimination on the basis of natural 
19
or protective hairstyles that people of African de-
20
scent are commonly adorned with violates existing 
21
Federal law, including provisions of the Civil Rights 
22
Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq.), section 1977 
23
of the Revised Statutes (42 U.S.C. 1981), and the 
24
Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq.). How-
25
23:45 May 19, 2021
H2116
4 
•HR 2116 IH
ever, some Federal courts have misinterpreted Fed-
1
eral civil rights law by narrowly interpreting the 
2
meaning of race or national origin, and thereby per-
3
mitting, for example, employers to discriminate 
4
against people of African descent who wear natural 
5
or protective hairstyles even though the employment 
6
policies involved are not related to workers’ ability to 
7
perform their jobs. 
8
(9) Applying this narrow interpretation of race 
9
or national origin has resulted in a lack of Federal 
10
civil rights protection for individuals who are dis-
11
criminated against on the basis of characteristics 
12
that are commonly associated with race and national 
13
origin. 
14
(10) In 2019 and 2020, State legislatures and 
15
municipal bodies throughout the United States have 
16
introduced and passed legislation that rejects certain 
17
Federal courts’ restrictive interpretation of race and 
18
national origin, and expressly classifies race and na-
19
tional origin discrimination as inclusive of discrimi-
20
nation on the basis of natural or protective hair-
21
styles commonly associated with race and national 
22
origin. 
23
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
24
gress that— 
25
23:45 May 19, 2021

•HR 2116 IH
(1) the Federal Government should acknowl-
1
edge that individuals who have hair texture or wear 
2
a hairstyle that is historically and contemporarily as-
3
sociated with African Americans or persons of Afri-
4
can descent systematically suffer harmful discrimi-
5
nation in schools, workplaces, and other contexts 
6
based upon longstanding race and national origin 
7
stereotypes and biases; 
8
(2) a clear and comprehensive law should ad-
9
dress the systematic deprivation of educational, em-
10
ployment, and other opportunities on the basis of 
11
hair texture and hairstyle that are commonly associ-
12
ated with race or national origin; 
13
(3) clear, consistent, and enforceable legal 
14
standards must be provided to redress the wide-
15
spread incidences of race and national origin dis-
16
crimination based upon hair texture and hairstyle in 
17
schools, workplaces, housing, federally funded insti-
18
tutions, and other contexts; 
19
(4) it is necessary to prevent educational, em-
20
ployment, and other decisions, practices, and policies 
21
generated by or reflecting negative biases and 
22
stereotypes related to race or national origin; 
23
(5) the Federal Government must play a key 
24
role in enforcing Federal civil rights laws in a way 
25
23:45 May 19, 2021
H2116

•HR 2116 IH
that secures equal educational, employment, and 
1
other opportunities for all individuals regardless of 
2
their race or national origin; 
3
(6) the Federal Government must play a central 
4
role in enforcing the standards established under 
5
this Act on behalf of individuals who suffer race or 
6
national origin discrimination based upon hair tex-
7
ture and hairstyle; 
8
(7) it is necessary to prohibit and provide rem-
9
edies for the harms suffered as a result of race or 
10
national origin discrimination on the basis of hair 
11
texture and hairstyle; and 
12
(8) it is necessary to mandate that school, 
13
workplace, and other applicable standards be applied 
14
in a nondiscriminatory manner and to explicitly pro-
15
hibit the adoption or implementation of grooming re-
16
quirements that disproportionately impact people of 
17
African descent. 
18
(c) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act is to institute 
19
definitions of race and national origin for Federal civil 
20
rights laws that effectuate the comprehensive scope of pro-
21
tection Congress intended to be afforded by such laws and 
22
Congress’ objective to eliminate race and national origin 
23
discrimination in the United States.
