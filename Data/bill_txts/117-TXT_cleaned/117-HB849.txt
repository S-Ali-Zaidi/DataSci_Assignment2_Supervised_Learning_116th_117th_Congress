1
and scientific process informing public policy deci-
2
sions;

(3) science, the scientific process, and the com-
4
munication of science should be free from politics, 
5
ideology, and financial conflicts of interest;

(4) policies and procedures that ensure the in-
7
tegrity of the conduct and communication of publicly 
8
funded science are critical to ensuring public trust; 
9
(5) a Federal agency that funds, conducts, or 
10
oversees research should not suppress, alter, inter-
11
fere with, or otherwise impede the timely commu-
12
nication and open exchange of data and findings to 
13
other agencies, policymakers, and the public of re-
14
search conducted by a scientist or engineer employed 
15
or contracted by a Federal agency that funds, con-
16
ducts, or oversees scientific research; 
17
(6) Federal agencies that fund, conduct, or 
18
oversee research should work to prevent the suppres-
19
sion or distortion of the data and findings; 
20
(7) under the First Amendment to the Con-
21
stitution, citizens of the United States have the right 
22
to ‘‘petition the government for a redress of griev-
23
ances’’; and

collectively, to petition Congress or a member of
