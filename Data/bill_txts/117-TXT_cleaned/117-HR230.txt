RESOLUTION 
Supporting the designation of the month of March 2021 
as ‘‘Eddie Bernice Johnson Black Women in Science 
and Technology Month’’. 
Whereas Black women are significantly underrepresented in 
the American science and technology fields; 
Whereas Black women have long contributed to the advance-
ment of our Nation’s scientific endeavors as ‘‘hidden fig-
ures’’, unrecognized for their sacrifice and labor; 
Whereas, today, Black women serve as astronauts, engineers, 
mathematicians, computer scientists, medical doctors, pi-
lots, and technologists; 
Whereas 
Historically 
Black 
Colleges 
and 
Universities 
(HBCUs) produce the highest number of women with

STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathe-
matics) degrees nationwide; 
Whereas only five percent of managerial positions in STEM 
were held by both Black men and women in 2017, ac-
cording to the National Science Foundation; 
Whereas social media movement of #BlacksInSTEM, dem-
onstrated the need to find and create community, while 
celebrating achievements in the field that go too often 
unrecognized and uncelebrated; 
Whereas Black women, belonging to multiple intersectional 
and marginalized groups, face both racial discrimination 
and sex discrimination as barriers to entry and upward 
mobility in the science and technology fields; 
Whereas a national effort to increase diversity and represen-
tation in the science and technology industries will help 
to— 
(1) reestablish the United States of America as a 
world leader in the global innovation economy; 
(2) reduce race-based disparities and increased trust 
in the American health care system for marginalized 
communities; and 
(3) combat misinformation and disinformation as it 
pertains to scientific and technological advancements; 
Whereas despite facing tremendous barriers, the work and 
contributions of Black women in the various fields of 
science and technology continue to move our Nation for-
ward amid the global coronavirus pandemic; 
Whereas March is recognized as Women’s History Month; 
Whereas Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson is a long- 
standing champion for STEM education and Black 
women in the science and technology fields;
