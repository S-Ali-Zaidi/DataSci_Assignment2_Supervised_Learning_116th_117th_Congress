RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the importance of independent living for individ-
uals with disabilities made possible by the Americans 
with Disabilities Act of 1990 and calling for further 
action to strengthen home and community living for indi-
viduals with disabilities. 
Whereas, in enacting the Americans with Disabilities Act of 
1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.), Congress recognized 
that ‘‘historically, society has tended to isolate and seg-
regate individuals with disabilities, and, despite some im-
provements, such forms of discrimination against individ-

uals with disabilities continue to be a serious and perva-
sive social problem’’; 
Whereas the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 recog-
nized the rights of individuals with disabilities to fully 
participate in their communities through independent liv-
ing, equality of opportunity, and economic self-suffi-
ciency; 
Whereas, 31 years after the enactment of the Americans with 
Disabilities Act of 1990 and 22 years after the decision 
of the Supreme Court of the United States in Olmstead 
v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), many individuals with dis-
abilities continue to live in segregated institutional set-
tings because of a lack of support services; 
Whereas continued instances of segregated institutional set-
tings have hindered the inclusion of individuals with dis-
abilities in communities, schools, and workplaces, under-
mining the promise of the Americans with Disabilities 
Act of 1990; 
Whereas people with disabilities living in institutional and 
long-term care settings suffered disproportionate rates of 
infection and death during the COVID–19 pandemic, 
with data showing 60 percent of COVID–19 deaths in-
volved a person with a disability; 
Whereas people of color with disabilities experience dispropor-
tionately greater barriers to quality, accessible health 
care, education, and employment opportunities, infringing 
on the right of such people under the Americans with 
Disabilities Act of 1990 to full participation in their com-
munities; 
Whereas, 31 years after the enactment of the Americans with 
Disabilities Act of 1990, people with disabilities continue

to face higher rates of unemployment and barriers to ac-
cessible workplaces and access to competitive integrated 
employment opportunities; 
Whereas, 31 years after the enactment of the Americans with 
Disabilities Act of 1990, some telecommunication, elec-
tronic, and information technologies continue to be devel-
oped without the goal of full accessibility and inclusion 
for all people of the United States; and 
Whereas, 31 years after the enactment of the Americans with 
Disabilities Act of 1990, many businesses, public and pri-
vate organizations, transportation systems, and services 
are still not accessible to all individuals with disabilities: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) recognizes the importance of independent 
2
living for individuals with disabilities made possible 
3
by the enactment of the Americans with Disabilities 
4
Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.); 
5
(2) encourages all people of the United States 
6
to celebrate the advancement of inclusion and equal-
7
ity of opportunity made possible by the enactment of 
8
the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990; 
9
(3) pledges to continue to work on a bipartisan 
10
basis to identify and address the remaining barriers 
11
that undermine the national goals of equality of op-
12
portunity, independent living, economic self-suffi-
13
ciency, and full participation for individuals with dis-

abilities, including by focusing on individuals with 
1
disabilities that remain segregated in institutions; 
2
(4) pledges to work with States to improve ac-
3
cess to home- and community-based services for in-

dividuals with disabilities; 
5
(5) calls on the Department of Labor to develop

policies and practices and provide technical assist-
7
ance that enable individuals with disabilities to 
8
achieve economic self-sufficiency; and 
9
(6) calls on the Department of Health and 
10
Human Services to provide information, resources, 
11
and technical assistance regarding home- and com-
12
munity-based services and supports that enable indi-
13
viduals with disabilities to live independently.
