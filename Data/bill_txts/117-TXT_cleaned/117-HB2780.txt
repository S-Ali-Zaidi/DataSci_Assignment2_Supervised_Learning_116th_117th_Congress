AREAS.—The 
term 
‘‘Insular 
7
Areas’’ means the territories and Freely Associated 
8
States. 
9

11
reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
12
(5) 
RESILIENCE.—The 
term 
‘‘Resilience’’ 
13
means the capacity of natural and human systems to 
14
resist, assimilate, and recover from the effects of cli-
15
mate change in an efficient and timely manner, 
16
maintaining or restoring basic structures and essen-
17
tial functions. 
18
(6) RENEWABLE ENERGY.—The term ‘‘renew-
19
able energy’’ means energy that has been derived 
20
from Earth’s natural resources that are not finite or 
21
exhaustible, including solar, wind, hydroelectric, geo-
22
thermal, and ocean (thermal and mechanics).

stand-alone systems, microgrids, nano grids, and vir-

SEC. 4. FINDINGS. 
15
Congress finds as follows: 
16
(1) The Insular Areas are topographically and 
17
environmentally diverse and treasured by millions of 
18
individuals who call them home. 
19
(2) The territories in the Caribbean (Puerto 
20
Rico and the Virgin Islands of the United States) 
21
and the territories in the Pacific (American Samoa, 
22
the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Is-
23
lands, and Guam) face many of the same climate 
24
01:22 Jun 08, 2021
H2780

•HR 2780 IH
change-related challenges. Freely Associated States 
1
face similar climate change-related vulnerabilities. 
2
(3) Insular Areas are experiencing sea level 
3
rise, coastal erosion, and increasing storm impacts 
4
that threaten lives, critical infrastructure, eco-
5
systems, and livelihood security. 
6
(4) Temperature increases are likely to further 
7
create and intensify the length of droughts, reduce 
8
water supply, impact public health, and increase de-
9
mand of freshwater in Insular Areas. In addition, 
10
temperature increases will drive coral reefs to extinc-
11
tion, eliminating a natural barrier against storm 
12
surge, increasing destruction of infrastructure, and 
13
threatening lives of the inhabitants of the islands. 
14
(5) In 2017, two major storms, Hurricane Irma 
15
and Hurricane Maria, impacted Puerto Rico and the 
16
Virgin Islands of the United States. Hurricane 
17
Maria caused thousands of deaths in Puerto Rico 
18
and the Virgin Islands of the United States and sig-
19
nificant damage to their infrastructure, including 
20
Puerto Rico’s energy system. Hurricane Maria de-
21
stroyed millions of trees in Puerto Rico and the Vir-
22
gin Islands of the United States, which has signifi-
23
cantly increased erosion and sediment transport. As 
24

•HR 2780 IH
a result, reservoirs have lost significant storage ca-
1
pacity and coral reefs are severely impacted. 
2
(6) In 2018, Typhoon Yutu impacted the Com-
3
monwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and 
4
Guam, causing catastrophic destruction in those ter-
5
ritories.
