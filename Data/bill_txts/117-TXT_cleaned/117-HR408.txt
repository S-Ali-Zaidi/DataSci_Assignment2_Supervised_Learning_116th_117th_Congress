on February 28 to express their will clearly and peace-
fully’’; 
Whereas the political party of President Nayib Bukele, 
Nuevas Ideas, won a sweeping majority of legislative 
seats in the February 2021 elections; 
Whereas electoral officials were threatened during the vote 
count; 
Whereas, in September 2019, President Nayib Bukele signed 
an agreement with the Secretary General of the Organi-
zation of American States to establish the International 
Commission Against Impunity in El Salvador (CICIES) 
in order to ‘‘support, strengthen, and actively collaborate 
with the institutions’’ of the Salvadoran state . . . ‘‘re-
sponsible for preventing, investigating, and punishing 
acts of corruption and related crimes’’ and by April 2021, 
the CICIES confirmed that it had sent twelve cases of 
possible corruption-related crimes to the office of the At-
torney General; 
Whereas the Government of El Salvador has increasingly 
been denounced for its attacks on press freedoms by or-
ganizations such as the Inter-American Commission on 
Human Rights and the Committee to Protect Journalists; 
Whereas, during its inaugural session on May 1, 2021, the 
Legislative Assembly of El Salvador overwhelmingly ap-
proved motions to remove and replace all five members 
of El Salvador’s Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme 
Court and the Attorney General without just cause; 
Whereas, also on May 1, 2021, the Legislative Assembly’s 
measure was determined unconstitutional by the deposed 
Constitutional Chamber, the Justices were prevented 
from carrying out their duties by the national police, and

the ruling was subsequently removed from the official

during the COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas, in recent weeks, top government officials have pro-
posed a constituent assembly with reforms, including per-
mitting Presidential reelections; and

iting democratic space for independent civil society: Now, 
therefore, be it
