A BILL 
To provide for the retrocession of the District of Columbia 
to Maryland, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘District of Columbia- 
4
Maryland Reunion Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following:

H2651
2 
•HR 2651 IH
(1) Residents of Washington, DC, pay Federal 
1
income tax, but do not have voting members in the 
2
United States Congress. 
3
(2) Article I, section 2, clause 1 of the United 
4
States Constitution states that the ‘‘House of Rep-
5
resentatives shall be composed of members chosen 
6
every second year by the people of the several 
7
states.’’. 
8
(3) The Founding Fathers did not consider the 
9
proposed district that would become Washington, 
10
DC, a State under the Constitution, as evidenced 
11
when Alexander Hamilton offered an amendment to 
12
the Constitution during the New York ratification to 
13
provide full congressional representation to Wash-
14
ington, DC, but the convention rejected the amend-
15
ment on July 22, 1788. Thomas Tredwell stated at 
16
the same convention that the plan for Washington, 
17
DC, ‘‘departs from every principle of freedom’’ be-
18
cause it did not give residents full representation in 
19
Congress. 
20
(4) Chief Justice Marshall held in Hepburn v. 
21
Ellzey in 1805 that the term ‘‘states’’ in article I, 
22
section 2, clause 1 of the Constitution does not in-
23
clude Washington, DC, for representation purposes. 
24
03:57 Jun 02, 2021
H2651

•HR 2651 IH
(5) Seven Supreme Court Justices affirmed 
1
Chief Justice Marshall’s Hepburn reasoning in Na-
2
tional Mut. Ins. Co. of Dist. of Col. v. Tidewater 
3
Transfer Co. in 1949. 
4
(6) A Democrat-controlled Congress in 1978 at-
5
tempted to amend the Constitution to provide Wash-
6
ington, DC, with full congressional representation. 
7
The Committee on the Judiciary of the House of 
8
Representatives reported the resolution and stated 
9
that granting congressional representation to the 
10
District of Columbia as it is presently constituted 
11
would require a constitutional amendment, because 
12
‘‘statutory action alone will not suffice’’. 
13
(7) Proposals to grant Washington, DC, con-
14
gressional representation will inevitably be chal-
15
lenged in court, calling into question the validity of 
16
any narrowly passed legislation that a Washington, 
17
DC, member votes on and leaving Washington, DC, 
18
residents in a continued state of flux over their sta-
19
tus. 
20
(8) Amending the Constitution requires two- 
21
thirds approval by each house of Congress and rati-
22
fication by three-fourths of the States. In 1978, 
23
there was success in obtaining a favorable vote from 
24
two-thirds of both the House and the Senate on a 
25
03:57 Jun 02, 2021
H2651
4 
•HR 2651 IH
constitutional amendment to provide Washington, 
1
DC, with full congressional representation, but the 
2
requirement for ratification by three-fourths of the 
3
States could not be obtained. 
4
(9) An alternative to a potentially lengthy and 
5
difficult constitutional amendment process is ceding 
6
Washington, DC, back to Maryland, just as an area 
7
of 31 square miles that was originally ceded by Vir-
8
ginia was returned to that State by Federal legisla-
9
tion in 1847, thereby ensuring that the portion of 
10
Washington, DC, in Virginia would have Senate and 
11
House representation. 
12
(10) In 1847, there was a desire to allow the 
13
District of Columbia land on the west side of the Po-
14
tomac River that was not being used by the Federal 
15
Government to have its own proper representation in 
16
Congress. 
17
(11) Obtaining the desired representation for 
18
this portion of Washington, DC, would have required 
19
a constitutional amendment unless the land were 
20
given back to Virginia. 
21
(12) Instead of trying to pass a constitutional 
22
amendment, Congress in 1847 legislatively ceded 
23
back to Virginia from the District of Columbia the 
24
03:57 Jun 02, 2021
H2651
5 
•HR 2651 IH
non-Federal land composed of 31 square miles on 
1
the west side of the Potomac River. 
2
(13) Accordingly, the District of Columbia 
3
would clearly and constitutionally have 2 Senators 
4
and a Representative with full voting rights by 
5
ceding the District of Columbia to Maryland after 
6
Maryland’s acceptance of such retrocession, while 
7
maintaining the exclusive legislative authority and 
8
control of Congress over the National Capital Serv-
9
ice Area in the District of Columbia.
