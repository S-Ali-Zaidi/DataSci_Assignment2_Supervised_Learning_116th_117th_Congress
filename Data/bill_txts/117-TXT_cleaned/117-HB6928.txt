ficking investigations and prosecutions in connection with 
the same, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘SESTA/FOSTA Ex-
4
amination of Secondary Effects for Sex Workers Study 
5
Act’’ or the ‘‘SAFE SEX Workers Study Act’’. 
6
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
7
The Congress finds the following: 
8
(1) People who engage in consensual, trans-
9
actional sex utilize online platforms to protect their 
10
health, safety, and independence. This use includes 
11
building community connections, distribution of 
12
harm reduction information and techniques, identi-
13
fication and screening of potential clients, sale of 
14
media and remote services and negotiating the terms 
15
of consensual, transactional sex services, including 
16
condom use and other harm reduction strategies. 
17
(2) Widespread discrimination against popu-
18
lations, including LGBTQIA+ individuals, particu-
19
larly transgender women of color, prevents many 
20
from accessing formal employment resources, tradi-
21
tional financial services, and educational opportuni-
22
ties.

(3) In the 2015 United States Transgender 
1
Survey conducted by the National Center for 
2
Transgender Equality, 19 percent of respondents re-
3
ported having exchanged sex for resources, such as 
4
for money, food, or a place to sleep. Transgender 
5
women of color, including Black (42 percent), Amer-
6
ican Indian (28 percent), multiracial (27 percent), 
7
Latina (23 percent), and Asian (22 percent) re-
8
spondents were more likely to have participated in 
9
sex work than the overall sample. 
10
(4) In the 2015 United States Transgender 
11
Survey, respondents who experienced homelessness 
12
in the past year (17 percent) were more than 3 
13
times as likely to have participated in sex work dur-
14
ing that year compared to the overall sample. 
15
(5) On a broader scale, internet platforms fos-
16
ter connections between people and play an integral 
17
part in American society. Access to digital platforms 
18
has been essential for activists, distribution of harm 
19
reduction information and reproductive and sexual 
20
health information, and fostering connections be-
21
tween people who face geographic barriers. Meaning-
22
ful regulation of internet platforms must take into 
23
account the role they play in the health, safety, and 
24
privacy of all people’s lives.

(6) While policymakers, representatives of inter-
1
net platforms, and some advocates have discussed 
2
ways to mitigate the use of internet platforms to de-
3
crease exploitation, people who consensually trade 
4
sex are rarely involved in the drafting of legislation 
5
or policies, or in assessing their impact, despite 
6
being amongst the populations who are impacted by 
7
legislation and policies related to the regulation of 
8
these internet platforms. 
9
(7) On February 27, 2018, the House of Rep-
10
resentatives passed the Allow States and Victims to 
11
Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act of 2017 (com-
12
monly known as ‘‘SESTA/FOSTA’’). While SESTA/ 
13
FOSTA holds websites liable for user-generated con-
14
tent that facilitates sex trafficking, it also impacts 
15
online platforms where users discuss consensual sex 
16
work and related topics. 
17
(8) Contemporaneously with the passage of 
18
SESTA/FOSTA in the Senate on March 21, 2018, 
19
websites preemptively shut down, some directly cit-
20
ing the law’s passage as the rationale for closure. 
21
(9) One week before President Donald Trump 
22
signed SESTA/FOSTA into law, the Department of 
23
Justice seized Backpage.com and arrested Backpage 
24
employees, citing promotion of prostitution and 
25

•HR 6928 IH
money laundering charges, similar to the Depart-
1
ment of Homeland Security’s seizure of Rentboy.com 
2
only a few years prior. 
3
(10) While these websites and individual ac-
4
counts have been closing down, there has been no 
5
national investigation rigorously examining the im-
6
pact of losing access to these platforms on the health 
7
and safety of people in consensual, transactional sex 
8
work. Regional and anecdotal information from 
9
health and safety service providers and sex workers 
10
has pointed to significant impacts on the health and 
11
safety of people who engage in consensual, trans-
12
actional sex. 
13
(11) Community organizations have reported 
14
increased homelessness of sex workers, including of 
15
sex workers who are caretakers for their families 
16
and have lost the economic stability provided by ac-
17
cess to online platforms. 
18
(12) Sex workers have reported a reduced abil-
19
ity to screen potential clients for safety, and nego-
20
tiate for boundaries such as condom use, resulting in 
21
reports of physical and sexual violence. 
22
(13) Many sex workers have turned to street- 
23
based work, which has historically involved higher 
24
rates of violence than other forms of transactional 
25
05:29 Mar 08, 2022

•HR 6928 IH
sex. Street-based sex workers have frequently noted 
1
practices which harm their health and safety, such 
2
as the confiscation of condoms by police, or use of 
3
condoms as evidence of arrest for prostitution. 
4
(14) With this new level of precarity, isolation, 
5
and vulnerability, there is substantial anecdotal evi-
6
dence that members of the sex work community are 
7
more frequently being contacted by third parties 
8
seeking to engage in management activities. This in-
9
cludes both sex workers who had always worked 
10
independently, as well as those who have previously 
11
experienced violence and exploitation by a third 
12
party. 
13
(15) The Federal Government has long dis-
14
cussed the importance of assessing collateral con-
15
sequences when looking at other industries. Com-
16
prehensive studies are essential to evaluate the im-
17
pact on human trafficking investigations and pros-
18
ecutions, and the health and safety of those involved 
19
in consensual, transactional sex, who are increas-
20
ingly losing access to digital platforms, which have 
21
been used for harm reduction information and tech-
22
niques, and to screen clients. Informed government 
23
policies begin with seeking out relevant information 
24
to better guide our actions moving forward.
