SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:

•HR 2684 IH
(1) The Cuban Family Reunification Parole 
1
(CFRP) program, initiated by President George W. 
2
Bush in 2007, allows United States citizens or law-
3
ful permanent residents to apply for their family 
4
members in Cuba to join them in the United States. 
5
(2) The CFRP program has been stalled since 
6
September 2017, when the State Department re-
7
duced the staff in Havana in response to severe 
8
brain injuries suffered by several members of the 
9
U.S. diplomatic community and their families. 
10
(3) The United States embassy website cur-
11
rently states that, ‘‘Due to staff reductions at the 
12
U.S. Embassy in Havana, Cuba, USCIS has sus-
13
pended operations at its field office in Havana.’’ 
14
Most Cuban nationals who apply for U.S. entry 
15
must travel to a third country, with all Cuban appli-
16
cations and interviews for immigrant visas handled 
17
by the U.S. Embassy in Georgetown, Guyana, re-
18
quiring applicants to incur additional costs such as 
19
airfare and lodging. 
20
(4) Cuban diplomats and other high-level Com-
21
munist Party operatives applying for diplomatic or 
22
official visas may remain in Cuba throughout the 
23
visa application process.

•HR 2684 IH
(5) According to press reports, the United 
1
States Navy housed approximately 50,000 migrants 
2
at one time on the naval station in Guantanamo 
3
Bay, Cuba in 1994. 
4
(6) The United States State Department hires 
5
local Cuban nationals at the United States embassy 
6
in Havana, Cuba some of whom have, according to 
7
accounts, intimidated those attempting to meet with 
8
personnel of the United States. The use of such re-
9
gime-provided Cuban nationals at the United States 
10
embassy in Havana, Cuba should be minimized to 
11
the greatest extent possible. 
12
(7) The regime in Cuba holds an egregious 
13
human rights record marred by repression of speech, 
14
religious belief, labor rights, as well as arbitrary de-
15
tentions, inhumane prison conditions, beatings, and 
16
other acts of repudiation. 
17
(8) The regime in Cuba places severe restric-
18
tions on basic human rights and liberties resulting 
19
in an oppressive environment with widespread fear 
20
of reprisal for expressing opposition to the regime. 
21
(9) According to U.S. State Department Report 
22
004246 of March 2021, ‘‘nearly all Cubans wishing 
23
to travel to the United States must apply for their 
24
visas outside of Cuba,’’ and further that ‘‘the De-
25

•HR 2684 IH
partment recognizes the necessity to leave Cuba to 
1
apply for a U.S. visa is a barrier many Cubans are 
2
unable or unwilling to surmount.’’. 
3
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
4
gress that no applicant should be discriminated against 
5
on the basis of race, age, disability, religion, sexual ori-
6
entation, gender identity, or sex characteristics, and that 
7
discrimination based on race, political opinion, religious 
8
belief, or association with a targeted group and hate 
9
crimes and other forms of discrimination against vulner-
10
able communities, including LGBTQ people, are human 
11
rights abuses.
