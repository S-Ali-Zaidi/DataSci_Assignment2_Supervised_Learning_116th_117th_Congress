A BILL 
To amend the Fair Credit Reporting Act to remove adverse 
information for certain defaulted or delinquent private 
education loan borrowers who demonstrate a history of 
loan repayment, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Student Borrower

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 4119 IH
(1) The October 2014 report of the Bureau of 
1
Consumer Financial Protection titled ‘‘Annual Re-
2
port of the CFPB Student Loan Ombudsman’’ 
3
noted many private education loan borrowers, who 
4
sought to negotiate a modified repayment plan when 
5
they were experiencing a period of financial distress, 
6
were unable to get assistance from their loan hold-
7
ers, which often resulting in them defaulting on 
8
their loans. This pattern resembles the difficulty 
9
that a significant number of mortgage loan bor-
10
rowers experienced when they sought to take respon-
11
sible steps to work with their mortgage loan servicer 
12
to avoid foreclosure during the Great Recession. 
13
(2) Although private student loan holders may 
14
allow a borrower to postpone payments while en-
15
rolled in school full-time, many limit this option to 
16
a certain time period, usually 48 to 66 months. This 
17
limited time period may not be sufficient for those 
18
who need additional time to obtain their degree or 
19
who want to continue their education by pursing a 
20
graduate or professional degree. The Bureau of Con-
21
sumer Financial Protection found that borrowers 
22
who were unable to make payments often defaulted 
23
or had their accounts sent to collections before they 
24
were even able to graduate.
