A BILL 
To require the Secretary of Labor, in consultation with the 
Secretary of Energy and Secretary of Education, to sub-
mit a report on current and future trends and shortages 
in the clean energy technology industry to achieve a 
clean energy economy, and to provide grants to establish 
and enhance training programs for any occupation or 
field of work for which a shortage is identified, and

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Green Jobs and Oppor-
2
tunity Act’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. 
4
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) The 21st century has some of the highest 
6
recorded temperatures in known history. 
7
(2) Scientists have high confidence that global 
8
temperatures will continue to rise for decades to 
9
come, largely due to greenhouse gases produced by 
10
human activities. 
11
(3) According to the Intergovernmental Panel 
12
on Climate Change (IPCC), which includes more 
13
than 1,300 scientists from the United States and 
14
other countries, there will likely be a temperature 
15
rise of 2.5 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit over the next 
16
century. 
17
(4) With only around 4.4 percent of the Earth’s 
18
population, World Bank studies have found that the 
19
United States is the second largest contributor of 
20
carbon dioxide emissions at 14.6 metric tons of CO2 
21
per capita. 
22
(5) When the world gets hotter, it can fuel the 
23
proliferation of drought, typhoons, hurricanes, wild-
24
fires, and general habitat change, and can affect the 
25
availability of food and water, among other issues.

(6) IPCC findings have revealed that the 
1
United States is projected to lose more than 
2
$500,000,000,000 in annual economic output by the 
3
year 2100 from global warming. 
4
(7) Additionally, the IPCC discovered that to 
5
avoid the most severe impacts of a changing climate, 
6
net-zero global emissions by 2050 will be required. 
7
(8) According to the Brookings Institution, a 
8
clean economy would encompass a vast array of in-
9
dustries and jobs directly involved in producing 
10
goods and providing services with an environmental 
11
benefit. 
12
(9) Under the 2019 Clean Jobs America report 
13
by E2 (Environmental Entrepreneurs), it is esti-
14
mated that 3.26 million workers are currently em-
15
ployed in, or are engaged in closely related activities, 
16
to the clean economy. 
17
(10) According to the International Labor Or-
18
ganization, by 2030, it is projected that over 24 mil-
19
lion new clean energy jobs will be needed globally to 
20
transition to a clean economy. 
21
(11) To meet this clean energy agenda, invest-
22
ing in job training will be crucial to ensuring the 
23
United States has a readied workforce.
