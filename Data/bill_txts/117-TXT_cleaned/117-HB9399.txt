(a) ASSESSMENT.— 
3
(1) IN
GENERAL.—The Chief of Engineers 
4
shall, at Federal expense, conduct an assessment, in 
5
consultation with the Secretary of Energy, of oppor-
6
tunities to install and maintain floating photovoltaic 
7
solar panels at Corps of Engineers projects. 
8
(2) CONTENTS.—In carrying out paragraph (1), 
9
the Chief of Engineers shall— 
10
(A) describe the economic, environmental, 
11
and technical viability of installing and main-
12
taining, or contracting with third parties to in-
13
stall and maintain, floating photovoltaic solar 
14
panels at Corps of Engineers projects; 
15
(B) identify Corps of Engineers projects 
16
with a high potential for the installation and 
17
maintenance of floating photovoltaic solar pan-
18
els, and whether such installation and mainte-
19
nance would require additional authorization; 
20
(C) account for potential effects on Corps 
21
of Engineers projects, and the authorized pur-
22
poses of such projects, of installing and main-
23
taining floating photovoltaic solar panels at 
24
such projects, including potential effects related 
25
to evaporation suppression, energy yield, dam

wildlife; 
2
(D) account for potential damage to float-
3
ing photovoltaic solar panels from weather, 
4
water level fluctuations, and recreational and 
5
other uses of the Corps of Engineers projects; 
6
and 
7
(E) account for the availability of electric 
8
grid infrastructure close to Corps of Engineers 
9
projects, including underutilized transmission 
10
infrastructure.

(b) REPORT
TO CONGRESS.—Not later than 18 
12
months after the date of enactment of this Act, the Chief 
13
of Engineers shall submit to Congress, and make publicly 
14
available (including on a publicly available website), a re-
15
port containing the results of the assessment conducted 
16
under subsection (a). 
17
(c) SUSTAINABILITY REPORTS.—Beginning not later 
18
than 24 months after the date of enactment of this Act, 
19
the Chief of Engineers shall include renewable energy 
20
from floating photovoltaic solar panels as part of any Sus-
21
tainability Report and Implementation Plan of the Corps 
22
of Engineers.

(1) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 24 months 
1
after the date of enactment of this Act, if supported 
2
by the results of the assessment conducted under 
3
subsection (a), the Chief of Engineers shall establish 
4
a pilot program for the deployment of floating pho-
5
tovoltaic solar panels at Corps of Engineers projects 
6
identified under paragraph (2)(B) of such subsection 
7
with respect to which any applicable non-Federal in-
8
terest for the project— 
9
(A) agrees to invest in and deploy floating 
10
photovoltaic solar panels; and 
11
(B) has the authority to enter into agree-
12
ments, including through public-private partner-
13
ships, for the purpose of carrying out such ac-
14
tivities. 
15
(2) COST SHARE.—In carrying out a project 
16
under this subsection, the Chief of Engineers may 
17
cover up to 100 percent of the cost of such project. 
18
(e) AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.—There is 
19
authorized to be appropriated to the Chief of Engineers 
20
$12,000,000, to remain available until expended, to carry
