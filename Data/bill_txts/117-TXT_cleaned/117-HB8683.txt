(1) The Pacific Islands are vital to United 
1
States national security and national interests in the 
2
Indo-Pacific region and globally. 
3
(2) The Pacific Islands region spans 15 percent 
4
of the world’s surface area and controls access to 
5
open waters in the Central Pacific, sea lanes to the 
6
Western Hemisphere, supply lines to United States 
7
forward-deployed forces in East Asia, and economi-
8
cally important fisheries. 
9
(3) The Pacific Islands region is home to the 
10
State of Hawaii, 11 United States territories, United 
11
States Naval Base Guam, and United States Ander-
12
sen Air Force Base. 
13
(4) Pacific Island countries cooperate with the 
14
United States and United States partners on mari-
15
time security and efforts to stop illegal, unreported, 
16
and destructive fishing. 
17
(5) The Pacific Islands are rich in biodiversity 
18
and on the frontlines of sea level rise, worsening 
19
tropical storms, and coral reef loss associated with 
20
climate change.

(6) The People’s Republic of China (PRC) 
22
seeks to increase its influence in the Pacific Islands

6

and the Kingdom of Tonga.

(8) The United States requires a physical diplo-
9
matic presence in the Republic of Vanuatu, the Re-
10
public of Kiribati, and the Kingdom of Tonga, to en-
11
sure the physical and operation security of our ef-
12
forts in those countries to deepen relations, protect 
13
United States national security, and pursue United 
14
States national interests.

(9) Increasing the number of United States em-
16
bassies dedicated solely to a Pacific Island country 
17

ment to the region and to the Pacific Island coun-
19
