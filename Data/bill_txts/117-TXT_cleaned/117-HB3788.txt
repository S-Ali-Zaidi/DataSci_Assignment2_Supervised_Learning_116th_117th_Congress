A BILL 
To establish limitations on modifications to trade agreements, 
and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Protecting American 
4
Innovation Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Section 8 of article I of the United States 
8
Constitution provides Congress with authority over

international trade. Congress has used that author-
1
ity to approve a number of trade agreements, includ-
2
ing the WTO Agreement. 
3
(2) Section 8 of article I of the United States 
4
Constitution provides Congress with authority to 
5
provide intellectual property protections in order to 
6
‘‘promote the progress of science and useful arts’’. 
7
People in the United States rely on those protections 
8
to support jobs and continue the highly successful 
9
leadership of the United States with respect to inno-
10
vation. 
11
(3) The United States may not withdraw or 
12
otherwise alter the rights and obligations for the 
13
United States arising from a congressionally ap-
14
proved trade agreement without the consent of Con-
15
gress. 
16
(4) The United States is a global leader in con-
17
taining and ending the COVID–19 pandemic. 
18
(5) Innovators in the United States successfully 
19
and rapidly brought to fruition vaccines that provide 
20
highly effective protection against COVID–19. At fa-
21
cilities across the United States, thousands of 
22
United States workers are working around the clock 
23
to manufacture COVID–19 vaccines, contributing to 
24
the rapid, global scale up of manufacturing that is 
25

•HR 3788 IH
expected to reach at least 10,000,000,000 doses by 
1
the end of 2021. 
2
(6) The United States is a founding member of 
3
the World Trade Organization. The United States 
4
has secured and supported critical commitments in 
5
the WTO for protection of intellectual property of 
6
United States persons and globally, including under 
7
the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property 
8
Rights Agreement or the TRIPS Agreement. 
9
(7) In implementing the Uruguay Round, Con-
10
gress established under section 315 of the Uruguay 
11
Round Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. 3581) that it is 
12
the objective of the United States to ‘‘accelerate the 
13
implementation’’ of the TRIPS Agreement and to 
14
‘‘seek enactment and effective implementation by 
15
foreign countries of laws to protect and enforce in-
16
tellectual property rights that supplement and 
17
strengthen the standards’’ of the TRIPS Agreement. 
18
(8) Longstanding intellectual property protec-
19
tions are critical to efforts by the United States and 
20
the biopharmaceutical industry to develop and man-
21
ufacture vaccines for both people in the United 
22
States and around the world. 
23
(9) The United States is committed to pro-
24
viding global access to COVID–19 vaccines.

•HR 3788 IH
(10) In order to accelerate production and dis-
1
tribution of COVID–19 vaccines, biopharmaceutical 
2
manufacturers in the United States are collaborating 
3
at a scale that previously was unimaginable, includ-
4
ing by entering into hundreds of voluntary manufac-
5
turing, production, and other partnerships around 
6
the world. 
7
(11) Manufacturing each of the COVID–19 
8
vaccines involves highly specialized and unique infra-
9
structure and equipment, as well as highly trained 
10
and experienced personnel. Manufacturing and dis-
11
tributing safe and effective COVID–19 vaccines on 
12
a global scale is incredibly challenging. Many experts 
13
on vaccine production and distribution are warning 
14
that waiving intellectual property protections will un-
15
dermine the global response to the COVID–19 pan-
16
demic and compromise vaccine safety, including by 
17
disrupting the distribution of scarce raw materials 
18
for vaccines that existing vaccine makers with prov-
19
en track records for delivering high-quality, safe, 
20
and effective vaccines need to continue their own 
21
production. 
22
(12) The United States Trade Representative 
23
announced without any consultation with Congress 
24
that the United States will support a waiver of intel-
25
00:55 Jul 14, 2021
H3788
5 
•HR 3788 IH
lectual property protections under the TRIPS Agree-
1
ment for COVID–19 vaccines. That decision is not 
2
consistent with the intellectual property negotiating 
3
objectives of the United States set forth in section 
4
315 of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (19 
5
U.S.C. 3581). 
6
(13) That waiver announcement created confu-
7
sion, and raised concerns that a successful effort to 
8
suspend protections will weaken already strained 
9
supply chains and foster the proliferation of ineffec-
10
tive and potentially dangerous vaccines. 
11
(14) The Trade Representative has not ex-
12
plained how a waiver of the TRIPS Agreement will 
13
expand vaccine production and access, particularly 
14
considering that the major impediments to vaccina-
15
tion efforts include the following: 
16
(A) The difficulty in meeting the technical 
17
specifications of production and appropriately 
18
ensuring that finished vaccines are high-quality, 
19
safe, and effective. 
20
(B) The scarcity of raw materials for the 
21
vaccines. 
22
(C) Last-mile distribution and cold-chain 
23
storage.

(D) Trade barriers to the free flow of in-
1
puts and finished products.

(15) The Government of the People’s Republic 
3
of China and the Government of the Russian Fed-
4
eration are engaged in large scale industrial espio-
5
nage and technology theft of intellectual property of 
6
United States persons. The Department of Justice 
7
has issued indictments in connection with attempts 
8
sponsored by the Government of the People’s Repub-
9
lic of China to steal United States vaccine research 
10
with respect to COVID–19. 
11
(16) The Government of the People’s Republic 
12
of China and the Government of the Russian Fed-
13
eration are using their vaccines as part of diplomatic 
14
efforts that may be contrary to the national security 
15
interests of the United States. Vaccines for COVID– 
16
19 manufactured by persons in the People’s Repub-
17
lic of China and the Russian Federation appear to 
18
be less efficacious than those manufactured by pro-
19
ducers in the United States. The Academy of Mili-
20
tary Science, the scientific arm of the military of the 
21
People’s Republic of China, is sponsoring the prin-
22
cipal effort by the People’s Republic of China to de-
23
velop its own mRNA vaccine.

(17) At a hearing before the Committee on Fi-
1
nance of the Senate on May 12, 2021, the Trade 
2
Representative would not commit either— 
3
(A) to ensure that any waiver of the 
4
TRIPS Agreement would exclude the People’s 
5
Republic of China and the Russian Federation; 
6
or 
7
(B) to ensure that Congress has advance 
8
access to the negotiating proposals of the 
9
United States for any such waiver. 
10
(18) The innovative biopharmaceutical compa-
11
nies in the United States contribute more than 
12
$1,100,000,000,000 annually to the United States 
13
economy, and employ more than 500,000 workers 
14
making 1.4 times the average earnings in the United 
15
States, including 153,000 workers who do not have 
16
a college degree. 
17
(19) Waiving intellectual property protections, 
18
particularly of the mRNA technology platform in 
19
which the Defense Advanced Research Project Agen-
20
cy invested not less than $250,000,000, raises seri-
21

•HR 3788 IH
(1) the United States should continue to act as

a global leader to help contain and end the COVID– 
2

3
(2) innovators in the United States are already 
4
heroes for their breakthrough work in developing 
5
and producing COVID–19 vaccines; 
6
(3) it should be a priority of the global commu-
7
nity, with the assistance of the United States, to ef-
8
ficiently and quickly manufacture and distribute 
9
COVID–19 vaccines around the world, and in par-
10
ticular to those countries that are most vulnerable; 
11
(4) current impediments to further vaccination 
12
efforts are due to— 
13
(A) the technically difficult manufacturing 
14
requirements for vaccines; 
15
(B) the need to appropriately ensure that 
16
vaccines are high-quality, safe, and effective; 
17
(C) raw material constraints; and 
18
(D) difficulties in distribution; 
19
(5) 
intellectual 
property 
protections 
for 
20
COVID–19 vaccines have not impeded vaccination

1
could lead to the production of substandard, ineffec-
2
tive, and potentially unsafe COVID–19 vaccines;

(8) the Trade Representative must consult with 
4
Congress before taking a position on the current 
5
TRIPS Agreement waiver proposal before the WTO

and any further proposals to waive or weaken intel-
7
lectual property obligations under the TRIPS Agree-

(9) Congress and the people of the United 
10
States are entitled to comprehensive expert analysis 
11
regarding the implications of a waiver to the TRIPS 
12
Agreement for jobs, economic growth, public health, 
13
and national security in the United States; and 
14
(10) the United States must oppose any waiver
