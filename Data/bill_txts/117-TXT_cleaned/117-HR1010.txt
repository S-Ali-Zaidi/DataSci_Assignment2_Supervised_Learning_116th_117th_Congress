RESOLUTION 
Expunging the December 18, 2019, impeachment of 
President Donald John Trump. 
Whereas the United States Constitution provides that the 
House of Representatives ‘‘shall have the sole Power of 
Impeachment’’ and that the President ‘‘shall be removed 
from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, 
Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Mis-
demeanors’’; 
Whereas, on December 18, 2019, the House of Representa-
tives passed House Resolution 755, Agreeing to Article I 
of the Resolution Impeaching Donald John Trump, 
President of the United States, for high Crimes and Mis-
demeanors, by a vote of 230 Yeas, a bipartisan coalition 
of 197 Nays, 1 Present, and 3 Not Voting;

Whereas Article I of the Resolution, entitled ‘‘Abuse of 
Power’’, alleges, based on vague innuendo, opinion, and 
hearsay, that President Trump ‘‘solicited the interference 
of a foreign government, Ukraine, in the 2020 United 
States Presidential election’’; 
Whereas Article I of the Resolution alleges President Trump 
‘‘sought to pressure the Government of Ukraine’’ to an-
nounce two investigations, the first into ‘‘a political oppo-
nent, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,’’ and 
the second, into provable lies by House and Senate 
Democrats that Donald Trump colluded with Russia to 
undermine the 2016 Presidential election; 
Whereas Article I of the Resolution alleges President Trump 
conditioned ‘‘(A) The release of $391 million . . . for the 
purpose of providing vital military and security assistance 
to Ukraine . . .; and (B) a head of state meeting at the 
White House . . .’’ with the President of Ukraine, upon 
a Ukrainian announcement that both a corruption inves-
tigation into influence-peddling by the Biden family and 
an investigation into election interference in the 2016 
United States Presidential election had begun; 
Whereas President Johnson was impeached in 1868 for vio-
lating the Tenure of Office Act; 
Whereas President Nixon’s resignation from office in 1974 
followed extensive, and provable, instances of criminal 
conduct, including multiple felony crimes; 
Whereas President Clinton was impeached in 1998 for the 
Federal crime of lying under oath to deny justice to a fel-
low American; 
Whereas, to substantiate the charge of ‘‘Abuse of Power’’, 
Article I of the Resolution is the first circumstance in

•HRES 1010 IH 
American history in which Articles of Impeachment con-
sidered, and passed by the House of Representatives, lack 
any allegation of any crime, no less the ‘‘high Crimes and 
Misdemeanors’’ standard required by Section Four of Ar-
ticle II of the United States Constitution; 
Whereas Article I of the Resolution alleges President 
Trump’s actions were taken ‘‘in pursuit of personal polit-
ical benefit . . . and thus ignored and injured the inter-
ests of the Nation’’; 
Whereas Article I of the Resolution fails to provide a modi-
fication for, definition of, or guidance to measure, that 
which qualifies as a ‘‘personal political benefit,’’ or ‘‘in-
jury to the interests of the Nation’’; 
Whereas proper consideration of whether ‘‘high Crimes and 
Misdemeanors’’ were committed cannot justly take place 
without properly defining the conduct at issue, particu-
larly when such conduct must meet Congress’ burden of 
‘‘clear and convincing evidence’’; 
Whereas Article I of the Resolution submits, as indisputable 
proof of the commission of an ‘‘Abuse of Power’’, a sub-
jective analysis of a July 25, 2019, ‘‘Memorandum of a 
Telephone Conversation’’ between President Trump and 
Ukrainian 
President 
Volodymyr 
Oleksandrovych 
Zelensky; 
Whereas, by the standards set forth in Article I of the Reso-
lution, any action that may affect an election could be po-
tentially construed as an ‘‘Abuse of Power’’, an action 
taken for ‘‘personal political benefit’’, or a solicitation to 
‘‘intervene’’ in an election; 
Whereas all past Presidential Impeachments in American his-
tory were based on well-defined and specific criminal

acts, not subjective accusations of intent, and cir-
cumstances in which the primary allegations were not 
proven; 
Whereas the anonymous ‘‘whistleblower complaint’’, which 
served as the impetus for the December 18, 2019, Im-
peachment of President Trump, was based entirely on 
secondhand knowledge, and hearsay; 
Whereas both the charge of ‘‘Abuse of Power’’ in Article I, 
and the charge of ‘‘Obstruction of Congress’’ in Article 
II, are built on presumptions contrary to facts and evi-
dence; 
Whereas the transcript of the July 25, 2019, call between 
President Trump and President Zelensky showed no con-
ditionality for any official act by President Zelensky, such 
as an announcement that both a corruption investigation 
into the Biden family, and a 2016 United States Presi-
dential election interference investigation, had begun; 
Whereas neither President Zelensky, nor his aides, had any 
knowledge that the $391,000,000 in Ukrainian military 
and security assistance was on hold for further review; 
Whereas, from the beginning, despite the rabid impeachment 
fervor led by House and Senate Democrats, media per-
sonalities, and the liberal elite class, both President 
Trump and President Zelensky maintained that there 
was no pressure, no quid pro quo, and no linkage be-
tween the $391,000,000, and the announcement of 
Ukrainian investigations; 
Whereas the $391,000,000 in Ukrainian military and security 
assistance was released without Ukraine announcing an 
investigation of any kind;

•HRES 1010 IH 
Whereas President Trump invited President Zelensky to meet 
with him at the White House on three occasions without 
any conditions, particularly no condition(s) of any an-
nouncement(s) of an investigation into the Biden family’s 
corrupt practices and influence-peddling in Ukraine; 
Whereas President Trump and President Zelensky met on 
September 25, 2019, with no Ukrainian announcement(s) 
of any investigation(s) into the Biden family’s corrupt 
practices and influence-peddling in Ukraine; 
Whereas skepticism of Ukrainian leaders and high-level offi-
cials was and is entirely reasonable, and advised, given 
Ukraine’s well-documented history as one of the most 
corrupt nations in the world; 
Whereas skepticism of the Biden family based on strong evi-
dence of a history of corruption and influence-peddling in 
Ukraine, as well as Hunter Biden’s role on the Board of 
Directors at Burisma Holdings Limited, is entirely rea-
sonable and advised; 
Whereas witnesses called by House Democrats during the im-
peachment proceedings testified that Burisma Holdings 
Limited has an extensive history of controversy in 
Ukraine; 
Whereas the founder of Burisma Holdings, Ukrainian oli-
garch Mykola Zlochevsky, was Ukraine’s Minister of 
Ecology and Natural Resources from 2010 to 2012, and 
allegedly granted licenses to Burisma Holdings for the 
development of gas fields in which he had a significant 
personal interest; 
Whereas Hunter Biden, alongside well-connected Democrat 
operative and now-convicted fraudster Devon Archer, 
joined Burisma’s Board of Directors at a time when the

company faced criticism, and at a time when Joe Biden, 
then Vice President of the United States, acted as Presi-
dent Obama’s primary advisor on Ukraine; 
Whereas it defies reason to assert that Hunter Biden was at 
all independently qualified for such a position, especially 
given his complete lack of experience, and self-admitted 
long history as a ne’er-do-well drug addict; 
Whereas the Obama State Department knew that Hunter 
Biden’s involvement in Ukraine was a point of ethical 
vulnerability, and took steps to thoroughly prepare and 
instruct United States Ambassador to Ukraine Marie L. 
Yovanovitch how best to answer questions thereon, at her 
June 21, 2016, confirmation hearing before the Senate 
Committee on Foreign Relations; 
Whereas, on January 23, 2018, during a Council on Foreign 
Relations discussion, then-Vice President Joe Biden 
bragged about a March 2016 encounter in which he 
bribed Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, by pro-
claiming to Poroshenko that the United States would not 
release $1,000,000,000 in loan guarantees unless 
Poroshenko fired Prosecutor General Victor Shokin, who 
was conducting an anti-corruption investigation into 
Burisma Holdings Limited, Hunter Biden, and, by exten-
sion, Joe Biden himself; 
Whereas, following his description of the particulars of the 
bribe, Joe Biden gleefully celebrated the success of his 
bribe before those in attendance, specifically stating 
‘‘Well, son of a bitch, [Shokin] got fired’’; 
Whereas the United States is just, and acting as a good stew-
ard of taxpayer dollars when it can, and often does, delay 
awarding such defense aid for various reasons, most no-

tably skepticism based on a historical pattern of corrup-
tion, particularly when that historical pattern implicates 
bribery committed by individuals at the highest levels of 
American Government, such as then-Vice President Joe 
Biden; 
Whereas a key and widely understood aspect of the Trump 
administration’s foreign policy platform was to scrutinize, 
and closely evaluate defense assistance programs to for-
eign nations; 
Whereas one of President Trump’s central campaign prom-
ises was to ensure that each country that receives defense 
assistance from the United States must first prove them-
selves worthy beneficiaries thereof; 
Whereas United States taxpayer-funded assistance to foreign 
governments is not considered an entitlement or welfare 
program, or that which is ‘‘owed’’ to any one recipient 
nation; 
Whereas a United States President enjoys broad authority to 
direct the foreign policy of the United States, and paus-
ing United States security assistance to Ukraine for fur-
ther scrutiny and analysis, for 55 days, was not and is 
not presumptive or prima facie evidence of misconduct, or 
a ‘‘quid pro quo’’ exchange, as characterized by congres-
sional Democrats before, and throughout, the impeach-
ment proceedings; 
Whereas, on December 18, 2019, the House of Representa-
tives passed House Resolution 755, Agreeing to Article II 
of the Resolution Impeaching Donald John Trump, 
President of the United States, for high crimes and mis-
demeanors, by a vote of 229 Ayes, a bipartisan coalition 
of 198 Noes, 1 Present, and 3 Not Voting;

Whereas the ‘‘Obstruction of Congress’’ allegations in Article 
II do not meet the impeachable standard set forth in Sec-
tion Four of Article II of the United States Constitution; 
Whereas, to substantiate the charge of ‘‘Obstruction of Con-
gress’’, Democrats submitted the fact that President 
Trump chose to assert executive privilege in response to 
partisan subpoenas issued by the House of Representa-
tives; 
Whereas Article II asserts that President Trump’s assertion 
of executive privilege, and his unwillingness to participate 
in a politically motivated effort to unseat him, is further 
irrefutable evidence of the commission of ‘‘high Crimes 
and Misdemeanors’’; 
Whereas the House of Representatives has no power to deter-
mine executive privileges to which a President is entitled; 
Whereas President Trump took every reasonable measure to 
ensure that which transpired between the White House 
and Ukraine was as transparent as possible to lawmakers 
and the public alike; 
Whereas, on September 25, 2019, after questions arose about 
the contents of the phone call with President Zelensky, 
President Trump chose to declassify and release the tran-
script in the interest of full transparency; 
Whereas President Trump further released a redacted version 
of the anonymous whistleblower complaint so that all 
Americans could read it for themselves; 
Whereas House Democrats had ample opportunity to defend 
their partisan subpoenas in court, but chose to withdraw 
those subpoenas, citing the fact that litigation would 
‘‘take too long’’, holding themselves to a self-imposed, 
and politically motivated, deadline of Christmas break;

Whereas, taken as a whole, both Articles in the Impeachment 
Resolution, as well as the hearings and investigations in 
the weeks preceding final passage by the full House of 
Representatives, are thinly veiled, desperate, and unsuc-
cessful attempts to grasp at any statement, public or pri-
vate, based on presumption or hearsay, that might re-
motely resemble evidence that President Trump engaged 
in a ‘‘quid-quo-pro’’ with President Zelensky; and 
Whereas by so flippantly exercising one of the gravest and 
most consequential powers with which the House of Rep-
resentatives is charged, Democrats have committed the 
sin about which the Founding Fathers of the United 
States warned, that being the use of presidential im-
peachment in a partisan fashion to settle political scores, 
and relitigate election results with which they disagree, in 
this case, the 2016 Presidential election of Donald 
Trump: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the December 18, 2019, impeachment 
1
of President Donald John Trump is expunged, as the facts

and circumstances upon which the Articles of Impeach-
