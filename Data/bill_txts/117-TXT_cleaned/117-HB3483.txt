Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Young Americans Fi-
2
nancial Literacy Act’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
The Congress finds as follows: 
5
(1) That 88 percent of Americans believe fi-
6
nance education should be taught in schools and 92 
7
percent of K–12 teachers believe that financial edu-
8
cation should be taught in school, but only 12 per-
9
cent of teachers actually teach the subject. 
10
(2) According to a 2020 survey, less than half 
11
of states require high school students to take a 
12
course on personal finance, and less than 17 percent 
13
of high schoolers were required to take a one semes-
14
ter personal finance course. 
15
(3) For the fourth year in a row, more than one 
16
third of surveyed consumers gave themselves a ‘‘B’’ 
17
when grading their own level of basic financial lit-
18
eracy. Less than one-fifth of Americans gave them-
19
selves an ‘‘A’’. Most adults feel that their financial 
20
literacy skills are inadequate, yet they do not rely on 
21
anyone else to handle their finances; they feel it is 
22
important to know more but have received no finan-
23
cial education. 
24
(4) The sudden disruptions caused by the 
25
spread of COVID–19 are presenting economic chal-
26
22:23 Jun 23, 2021

•HR 3483 IH
lenges with growing consequences. While some fac-
1
tors affecting financial well-being are beyond indi-
2
vidual control, financial literacy can help people bet-
3
ter manage their finances through times of hardship. 
4
(5) It is necessary to respond immediately to 
5
the pressing needs of individuals faced with the loss 
6
of their financial stability; however increased atten-
7
tion must also be paid to financial literacy education 
8
reform and long-term solutions to prevent future 
9
personal financial disasters. 
10
(6) There is an urgent need to respond to the 
11
COVID–19 economic recovery with research-based 
12
financial literacy education programs to reach indi-
13
viduals at all ages and socioeconomic levels, particu-
14
larly those facing unique and challenging financial 
15
situations, such as high school graduates entering 
16
the workforce, soon-to-be and recent college grad-
17
uates, young families, and the unique needs of mili-
18
tary personnel and their families. 
19
(7) High school and college students who are 
20
exposed to cumulative financial education show an 
21
increase in financial knowledge, which in turn drives 
22
increasingly responsible behavior as they become 
23
young adults. 
24

•HR 3483 IH
(8) The majority (52 percent) of young adults 
1
between the ages of 23–28 consider ‘‘making better 
2
choices about managing money’’, the single most im-
3
portant issue for individual Americans to act on 
4
today. 
5
(9) According to the Government Accountability 
6
Office, giving Americans the information they need 
7
to make effective financial decisions can be key to 
8
their well-being and to the country’s economic 
9
health. The current pandemic, in which 88 percent 
10
of Americans say is causing stress on their personal 
11
finances, underscores the need to improve individ-
12
uals’ financial literacy and empower all Americans to 
13
make informed financial decisions. This is especially 
14
true for young people as they are earning their first 
15
paychecks, securing student aid, and establishing 
16
their financial independence. Therefore, focusing 
17
economic education and financial literacy efforts and 
18
best practices for young people between the ages of 
19
8–24 is of utmost importance.
