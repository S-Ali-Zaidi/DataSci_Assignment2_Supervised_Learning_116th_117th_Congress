RESOLUTION 
Memorializing those impacted by and lost to the COVID– 
19 virus. 
Whereas the first Monday in March would be an appropriate 
day to be recognized as COVID–19 Victims and Sur-
vivors Memorial Day; 
Whereas COVID–19 (SARS–CoV–2), a novel coronavirus, is 
a deadly illness caused by a virus that can transmit from 
person to person;

Whereas, in 2020, COVID–19 began to spread throughout 
the world, creating a global pandemic that has had a cat-
astrophic impact on human life, our communities, and 
our economy; 
Whereas, in March 2020, communities in every State began 
to experience increased loss of life, and families lost fa-
thers, mothers, brothers, sisters, sons, daughters, and 
neighbors from the virus; 
Whereas, beginning in 2020, many across the United States 
were and continue to be personally impacted by COVID– 
19 including mourning their loved ones and neighbors or 
suffering from the unknown long-term health implications 
of the virus; 
Whereas, by the end of February 2021, there were more than 
28,065,000 known cases of the virus in the United 
States, and more than 500,000 people tragically lost 
their lives; 
Whereas COVID-19 has had a disproportionate impact on 
low-income communities and communities of color—with 
higher rates of infection and death—exacerbating inequi-
ties already prevalent in our systems that we must ad-
dress as a Nation; 
Whereas public servants, frontline and essential workers, and 
health care professionals took selfless actions to protect 
their neighbors and communities, support struggling local 
economies, and find innovative ways to provide services; 
Whereas local, State, Tribal, and Federal Government enti-
ties provided critical support to businesses, communities, 
and Americans in need;

Whereas the COVID–19 pandemic continues to have an im-
pact on the United States and countries around the 
world; and

ken system brought to light, and each sacrifice made 
shall never be forgotten: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) will memorialize those lost to the COVID– 
2
19 virus; 
3
(2) recognizes the suffering of those who con-
4
tracted the COVID–19 virus and survived but carry
