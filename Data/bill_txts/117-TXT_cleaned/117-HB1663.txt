SEC. 101. FINDINGS; PURPOSE. 
4
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that— 
5
(1) the Tijuana River flows across the United 
6
States-Mexico border, through the southern United 
7
States, and into the Pacific Ocean; 
8
(2) 3⁄4 of the 1,750 square mile watershed of 
9
the Tijuana River lies in Mexico, and the remaining 
10
1⁄4 includes the Tijuana River National Estuarine 
11
Research Reserve in the United States; 
12
(3) the Tijuana River National Estuarine Re-
13
search Reserve is a partnership of Federal and State 
14
agencies, including the National Oceanic and Atmos-
15
pheric Administration, California State Parks, and 
16
the United States Fish and Wildlife Service; 
17
(4) the Tijuana River is a significant estuary 
18
and watershed, providing— 
19
(A) economic and health benefits to the 
20
citizens of the United States and Mexico; and 
21
(B) environmental benefits as critical habi-
22
tat to shore birds; 
23
(5) the economy of communities in southern 
24
California, including smaller communities, such as 
25

•HR 1663 IH
the City of Imperial Beach, and larger municipali-
1
ties, such as the City of San Diego, may be signifi-
2
cantly affected if the natural beauty and recreational 
3
opportunities of the Tijuana River are degraded; 
4
(6) the Tijuana River watershed is in the midst 
5
of an environmental crisis, as stormwater flows from 
6
the upper watershed, originating in Tijuana, Mexico, 
7
carrying pollutants such as bacteria, trash, and sedi-
8
ment that severely affect water quality; 
9
(7) coastal communities in and near the Ti-
10
juana River watershed are also affected, during cer-
11
tain tidal events, by a combination of treated waste-
12
water and chlorinated-only wastewater discharged 
13
from the San Antonio de los Buenos wastewater 
14
treatment plant located 5 miles south of the United 
15
States-Mexico border in Tijuana; 
16
(8) as reported by the Government Account-
17
ability Office in February 2020, transboundary flows 
18
of untreated sewage, combined with unmanaged 
19
stormwater, bring bacteria and other contaminants 
20
into the Tijuana River Valley watershed and beaches 
21
in the United States; 
22
(9) sediment flows into the Tijuana River Na-
23
tional Wildlife Refuge and blocks the flow of ocean

1
necessary for marsh plants, fish, and birds; 
2
(10) the City of Imperial Beach has closed 
3
beach access 1⁄3 of each year for several years before 
4
the date of enactment of this Act due to risk to 
5
human health; 
6
(11) flows of untreated sewage, chemicals, and 
7
pollution from Mexico jeopardize the health of Bor-
8
der Patrol agents and limiting the ability of those 
9
agents to operate in areas affected by these flows; 
10
(12) in the 2 years before the date of enact-
11
ment of this Act, local Border Patrol union officials 
12
have reported that over 100 officers have suffered 
13
from contamination, rashes, infections, chemical 
14
burns, and lung irritation due to toxic cross-border 
15
flows; 
16
(13) a March 2020 report of the Environmental 
17
Financial Advisory Board of the Environmental Pro-
18
tection Agency— 
19
(A) found that— 
20
(i) ‘‘stormwater knows no jurisdic-
21
tional boundaries . . . and is a principal 
22
cause of water quality issues nationwide’’;

(ii) adequate funding to manage

stormwater pollution lags behind the in-
2

5
(B) concluded that Federal investment will 
6
be required to address— 
7
(i) the lack of State and local funding; 
8
and 
9
(ii) 
multi-jurisdictional 
stormwater 
10
management needs; 
11
(14) during the 10-year period before the date 
12
of enactment of this Act, Federal, State, and local 
13
governments and others have identified the benefits 
14
of using natural and green infrastructure to control 
15
and manage stormwater runoff, including wetlands, 
16
coastal dunes, and retention structures; 
17
(15) during the 20-year period before the date 
18
of enactment of this Act, the United States and 
19
Mexico, through the International Boundary and 
20
Water Commission, have agreed to resolve the pollu-
21
tion problems in the Tijuana River;

the construction of the South Bay International 
4
Wastewater Treatment Plant in San Ysidro to treat,

on average, 25,000,000 gallons of sewage from Ti-
6
juana per day, which has reduced the sewage coming 
7
into the United States; 
8
(18) the sewer system of Tijuana is— 
9
(A) aging and deteriorating; and 
10
(B) insufficient to meet the needs of a 
11
quickly growing population; 
12
(19) in February 2017, 1 of the main sewer col-
13
lectors of Tijuana broke, sending an estimated 
14
143,000,000 gallons of raw sewage into the United 
15
States, which was not the only time such a break oc-
16
curred; 
17
(20) from February to July of 2019, an esti-
18
mated 4,500,000,000 gallons of wastewater, treated 
19
water, and stormwater flowed from Mexico to the 
20
United States; 
21
(21) in June and July 2019, there were 3 sewer 
22
collector breaks, resulting in a total discharge of raw 
23
sewage of almost 2,000,000 gallons;

(22) a 2019 study entitled ‘‘Tijuana River Di-
1
version Study: Flow Estimates, Infrastructure Diag-
2

3
that from 2009 through 2016, transboundary flows 
4
occurred on average 138 days each year; 
5
(23) those transboundary flows contain treated 
6
wastewater, raw sewage, and urban runoff, with 
7
most of those flows associated with wet weather and 
8
stormwater; 
9
(24) the study described in paragraph (22)— 
10
(A) found that improving the operational 
11
reliability of the existing diversion system of the 
12
South Bay could reduce the number of days 
13
that transboundary flows occurred; but 
14
(B) estimated that there would still be on 
15
average 90 days of transboundary flows each 
16
year; 
17
(25) the Federal Water Pollution Control Act 
18
(33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) has established a 
19
stormwater permit program under the National Pol-
20
lutant Discharge Elimination System, under which 
21
municipalities have the responsibility to manage and 
22
treat stormwater;

1
treated to the same standards as the standards to 
2
which discharges would be treated in the United 
3

4
(27) the International Boundary and Water 
5
Commission negotiated Minute 320 to find solutions 
6
for water quality, trash, and sediment in the Tijuana 
7
River; 
8
(28) the United States has— 
9
(A) invested at least $250,000,000 for sec-
10
ondary wastewater treatment in the Tijuana 
11
River Valley by the International Boundary and 
12
Water Commission; and 
13
(B) paid $18,000,000 to operate and

17

18

19
(30) however, as the Government Accountability

SEC. 201. FINDINGS; PURPOSE. 
11
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that— 
12
(1) the New River was born out of— 
13
(A) occasional flows of the Colorado River 
14
into the Salton Sink; and 
15
(B) the erosion of the New River channel, 
16
which formed the deep river canyon between 
17
1905 and 1907; 
18
(2) the New River— 
19
(A) starts in Mexicali, Mexico; 
20
(B) flows north into the United States 
21
through Calexico; 
22
(C) passes through the Imperial Valley;

mately 66 miles north of the international 
2
boundary; 
3
(3) the sub-watershed of the New River covers 
4
approximately 750 square miles, of which 63 percent 
5
is in Mexico and 37 percent is in the United States; 
6
(4) the New River has been widely recognized 
7
for significant water pollution problems, primarily 
8
because of agricultural runoff, raw sewage, pes-
9
ticides, and discharges of wastes from domestic, ag-
10
ricultural, and industrial sources in Mexico and the 
11
Imperial Valley; 
12
(5) by the 1980s, the New River acquired the 
13
reputation of being 1 of the most polluted rivers in 
14
the United States, with many pollutants in the New 
15
River posing serious human health hazards to local 
16
populations, particularly in Calexico and Mexicali; 
17
(6) in 1992, Minute 288 of the International 
18
Boundary and Water Commission— 
19
(A) established a sanitation strategy for 
20
the water quality problems of the New River at 
21
the international border; and 
22
(B) divided sanitation projects into 2 im-

5
(7) in 1995, the Environmental Protection 
6
Agency provided funds to the California Regional 
7
Water Quality Control Board to monitor and docu-
8
ment the water quality at the international boundary

on a monthly basis; 
10
(8) in the late 1990s— 
11
(A) the United States and Mexico spent 
12
$100,000,000 (of which 45 percent was paid by 
13
Mexico and 55 percent was paid by the United 
14
States) to build the Las Arenitas and Zaragoza 
15
wastewater treatment plants; and 
16
(B) after the construction of those plants, 
17
untreated water from the New River was passed 
18
through 4 microbial treatment cells at the Las 
19
Arenitas wastewater treatment plant, which was 
20
then chlorinated and fed into a reforestation
