A BILL 
To authorize a study on the efficacy and potential negative 
impacts of masks to human health, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
3
It is the sense of Congress that— 
4
(1) the Constitution does not permit a mask 
5
mandate through use of exclusively Executive power; 
6
(2) Congress has not enacted any such law for 
7
the President to enforce;

(3) masks do not fall within any of the Execu-
1
tive authorities, according to article II, section 2 of 
2
the United States Constitution; 
3
(4) even Congress has no authority under the 
4
United States Constitution to impose widespread 
5
mask mandates on the States and people; 
6
(5) the Constitution reserves ‘‘police power’’, 
7
for the protection of health, safety, and morals, to 
8
the States; 
9
(6) even though a State has police power, strict 
10
scrutiny is still applied when laws infringe on funda-
11
mental liberties, and in such instance, government 
12
action is only constitutional when it both achieves a 
13
compelling goal and is narrowly tailored or the least 
14
restrictive alternative to achieve that goal; 
15
(7) in our constitutional republic, the Federal 
16
Government cannot do as it pleases, but must exer-
17
cise power only in keeping with the strict limits as 
18
enumerated in the Constitution; 
19
(8) while the Constitution ensures that the Fed-
20
eral Government cannot mandate that all Americans 
21
wear masks, any government should not take such 
22
an action unless the potential for causing countless 
23
Americans to have adverse health impacts is fully 
24
considered and studied, and there is no other less re-

strictive measures that could adequately be taken; 
1
and 
2
(9) although Americans are fully equipped to 
3
adjust their activities and lifestyles to account for 
4
the risk of SARS–CoV–2, including wearing a mask 
5
at all times if one should choose to, it is unjust to 
6
require all Americans to take an action if that action 
7
could mean deteriorated health and even death of 
8
some and no exceptions are permitted.

(a) IN GENERAL.—The Comptroller General of the 
13
United States shall conduct a study on the efficacy and 
14

15
(b) TOPICS.—The study under subsection (a) shall 
16
address each of the following: 
17
(1) Evidence that various mask options (includ-
18
ing N–95 masks, basic medical masks, and cloth 
19
masks) actually prevent the spread of SARS–CoV– 
20
2, and to what extent such masks are successful 
21
compared to no mask or a less restrictive method-

ology.

with the common types of masks worn (including N– 
2
95 masks, basic medical masks, and cloth masks). 
3
(3) Any adverse side effects of mask wearing. 
4
(4) Any potential for permanent adverse effects 
5
including deaths resulting from mask wearing. 
6
(5) Any evidence that mask wearing is particu-
7
larly dangerous if an individual has underlying con-
8
ditions, to include allergies, asthma, respiratory dif-
9
ficulty, or any other bodily condition that can impact 
10
breathing or lung capacity and functioning.
