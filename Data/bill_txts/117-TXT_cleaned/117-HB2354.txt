Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

7
ferred to as ‘‘EMS’’) personnel provide a critical role

in emergency response. EMS consists of a diverse 
1
group of health care practitioners, such as para-
2
medics, emergency medical technicians (in this Act 
3
referred to as ‘‘EMTs’’), dual-role firefighter/EMTs, 
4
firefighter/paramedics, and volunteer personnel serv-
5
ing in each of such roles. 
6
(2) EMS is an integral component of the re-
7
sponse capacity of the United States to disasters 
8
and public health crises, such as outbreaks of infec-
9
tious diseases, bombings, mass shootings, earth-
10
quakes, tornadoes, and hurricanes. EMS personnel 
11
respond to more than 22,000,000 emergency calls 
12
each year including strokes, heart attacks, cardiac 
13
arrest, and trauma. 
14
(3) The Bureau of Labor Statistics compiles in-
15
formation on the number of individuals working in 
16
roles across the entire United States workforce. The 
17
Bureau of Labor Statistics completes this work by 
18
maintaining the Standard Occupational Classifica-
19
tion system which classifies workers and jobs into 
20
occupational categories for the purpose of collecting, 
21
calculating, analyzing, or disseminating data. 
22
(4) The BLS fails to accurately count EMS 
23
practitioners because of its failure to include dual-

role firefighter/EMTs and firefighter/paramedics in 
1
their count of EMS personnel. 
2
(5) Accurately counting the EMS workforce is 
3
critical for government agencies in determining the 
4
needs of EMS agencies and practitioners. These 
5
data are also crucial for informing many aspects of 
6
policy including preparedness for natural disasters, 
7
public health emergencies, and acts of terrorism.
