SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
The Congress makes the following findings: 
2
(1) Many areas of undeveloped National Forest 
3
System lands, National Park System lands, and 
4
public lands administered by the Bureau of Land 
5
Management in the States of Idaho, Montana, Or-
6
egon, Washington, and Wyoming possess out-
7
standing natural characteristics which give them 
8
high values as wilderness, parks, and wild and scenic 
9
rivers and will, if properly preserved, be an enduring 
10
resource of wilderness, wild land areas, and biodiver-
11
sity for the benefit of the American people. 
12
(2) The Northern Rockies Bioregion contains 
13
the most diverse array of wild lands remaining south 
14
of Canada, providing sanctuary for a host of species 
15
listed as threatened or endangered under section 
16
4(c) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 
17
U.S.C. 1533(c)). These national interest public lands 
18
16:55 May 11, 2021
H1755

•HR 1755 IH
are among the most popular wild lands in the 
1
United States, embracing greater ecosystems and 
2
national treasures such as the Greater Yellowstone, 
3
Greater Glacier/Northern Continental Divide, Great-
4
er Hells Canyon/Wallowa, Greater Salmon/Selway, 
5
and Greater Cabinet/Yaak/Selkirk ecosystems. 
6
(3) The natural ecosystems in the Northern 
7
Rockies Bioregion are largely dependent on National 
8
Forest System lands, National Park System lands, 
9
and public lands administered by the Bureau of 
10
Land Management, and the ecological productivity 
11
and diversity of resources these Federal public lands 
12
provide. Conservation of roadless areas on these 
13
public lands, which produces clean water, protects 
14
native fisheries and native flora and fauna, and pro-
15
vides scenic and recreational qualities, also preserves 
16
options for sustainable economics through activities 
17
such as hunting, fishing, and wilderness-based recre-
18
ation. 
19
(4) The headwaters of several major river sys-
20
tems, including the Columbia, Snake, Green, Mis-
21
souri and Saskatchewan Rivers, originate in the 
22
Northern Rockies Bioregion, and these rivers send 
23
their waters to three different oceans. These waters 
24
are of tremendous economic importance to farming 
25
16:55 May 11, 2021
H1755
5 
•HR 1755 IH
and ranching operations, municipal water supplies, 
1
and water-based recreation, including fishing and 
2
boating. Protection of this world class water re-
3
source will enhance these uses, reduce costs for 
4
water treatment and irrigation, and increase native 
5
fish populations. 
6
(5) The wildlife treasures of the Northern 
7
Rockies are of international significance and contain 
8
remarkably intact large mammalian fauna and rare 
9
and unique plant life. Wildlife habitat fragmentation 
10
due to roadbuilding, timber harvest, mining, oil and 
11
gas exploration, lack of interagency cooperation, and 
12
other activities has severe effects on the wildlife pop-
13
ulations (including those listed as threatened or en-
14
dangered under section 4(c) of the Endangered Spe-
15
cies Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1533(c))) and their 
16
habitat, the water quality, the ancient forests, and 
17
the greater ecosystems of the Northern Rockies Bio-
18
region. The overemphasis on resource extraction 
19
from National Forest System lands and public lands 
20
administered by the Bureau of Land Management 
21
has compromised ecosystem integrity and detracted 
22
from economic diversification opportunities. Eco-
23
nomic instability and high unemployment in rural,

•HR 1755 IH
resource-dependent communities is a common result 
1
of overexploitation of these lands. 
2
(6) Continued fragmentation and development 
3
of the remaining roadless and essentially roadless 
4
ecosystems and biological connectors of the Northern 
5
Rockies would cause a loss to the Nation of an en-
6
tire wild land region and of the only remaining areas 
7
south of Canada still pristine enough to support 
8
populations of caribou, gray wolves, grizzly bears, 
9
anadromous fish, and numerous other rare and en-
10
dangered plant and animal life all in one intact bio-
11
region. 
12
(7) Since the 1936 roadless area inventory com-
13
pleted by Bob Marshall, millions of acres of roadless 
14
wild lands have been developed in the Northern 
15
Rockies. Extensive fragmentation of wild lands and 
16
wildlife habitat has resulted in the listing of several 
17
species as threatened or endangered and reduced the 
18
numbers and range of many others, including anad-
19
romous fish. 
20
(8) The natural ecosystems of the Northern 
21
Rockies Bioregion also serve as educational and re-
22
search centers for on-site studies in biology, geology, 
23
astronomy and other sciences. The pristine nature of 
24

System lands, and public lands administered by the 
1
Bureau of Land Management in the Northern Rock-
2
ies Bioregion helps local communities attract new 
3
residents and businesses based on local quality of 
4
life. 
5
(9) A review of the current situation in the 
6
Northern Rockies has revealed the urgent need for 
7
an ecological reserve system for the Northern Rock-
8
ies Bioregion, which includes core ecosystem reserve 
9
areas and biological connecting corridors necessary 
10
to ensure wildlife movements and genetic inter-
11
change between the core reserve areas. Wildlife free-
12
dom of movement has always been essential to the 
13
survival of wildlife species, and an increasing num-
14
ber of scientific studies have identified movement 
15
corridors as a necessity for wildlife conservation in 
16
a changing climate. Several foreign governments, in-
17
cluding the governments of Australia and Scotland, 
18
have announced plans for corridors that would make 
19
wildlife movement possible as climate pressures in-
20
crease. The concept of connective corridors for wild-
21
life movement has been endorsed by governors of 
22
States in the western United States, and is now 
23
widely recognized by conservation and scientific or-
24
ganizations. For example, freedom of movement for 
25
16:55 May 11, 2021

•HR 1755 IH
wildlife is basic to the emerging new science of 
1
‘‘Movement Ecology’’ described in a December 2008 
2
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 
3
This freedom of wildlife movement was a funda-
4
mental reason for the Act’s development and intro-
5
duction, and has become an increasingly high profile 
6
issue in the climate and biological sciences. 
7
(10) The economic value to the Nation of most 
8
of these undeveloped areas, left in their natural 
9
state, greatly exceeds any potential return to the 
10
Treasury of the United States from timber harvest 
11
and development. If current Federal land manage-
12
ment in the Northern Rockies continues to result in 
13
the development of roadless areas, the American 
14
public will be using its tax dollars to fund perma-
15
nent reductions in wilderness, water quality, fish and 
16
wildlife habitat, and species and biological diversity. 
17
(11) Instead, this Act provides opportunities for 
18
employment in outdoor trades by establishing reha-
19
bilitation zones on specific tracts of damaged Fed-
20
eral land where active restoration work will occur. 
21
This Act will provide contracts for local businesses 
22
and renew the intrinsic economic, social and cultural 
23
benefits that result from productive land. Federal 
24
land rehabilitation projects represent a direct benefit

to the local economy and reduce the loss to Amer-
1
ican taxpayers caused by below-cost timber sales and 
2
other subsidized resource extraction. 
3
(12) The congressional review of roadless areas 
4
within the National Forest System, National Park 
5
System, and public lands administered by the Bu-
6
reau of Land Management in the States of Idaho, 
7
Montana, Oregon, Washington, and Wyoming has 
8
identified areas which, on the basis of their land 
9
form, ecosystem, associated fish and wildlife, eco-
10
nomic value, and location will help to fulfill the role 
11
of the United States Forest Service, National Park 
12
Service, and Bureau of Land Management to ensure 
13
a quality National Wilderness Preservation System. 
14
The review has identified other areas which may 
15
have outstanding values as wild and scenic rivers. 
16
The review has also identified areas which may not 
17
possess outstanding wilderness attributes and should 
18
not now be designated as components of the Na-
19
tional Wilderness Preservation System, but which 
20
should be studied to determine their role in main-
21
taining biological diversity in the Northern Rockies. 
22
(13) Many areas of National Forest System 
23
lands and public lands administered by the Bureau 
24
of Land Management have been damaged and their 
25
16:55 May 11, 2021

•HR 1755 IH
productivity reduced by unwise development prac-
1
tices, which have also impaired ecosystem function 
2
and biological diversity. The Island Park area adja-
3
cent to Yellowstone National Park contains large 
4
clear-cut areas right up to the park boundary. Ef-
5
forts should be made to return these areas to their 
6
former ecological health and native diversity. These 
7
efforts should seek to ensure that vital ecosystem 
8
components are restored, especially in areas where 
9
wildlife travel corridors and native fish and wildlife 
10
populations have been damaged or eliminated. Res-
11
toration efforts should seek to ensure and maintain 
12
genetic interchange, biological diversity, and restora-
13
tion of native species diversity throughout the 
14
Northern Rockies Bioregion. 
15
(14) Backcountry areas of the National Park 
16
System have been damaged by inappropriate man-
17
agement, despite policies that require that rec-
18
ommended wilderness be administered as wilderness. 
19
An emphasis on structures and motorized equip-
20
ment, 
and 
in 
some 
instances 
developed 
21
‘‘backcountry’’ campsites, have all detracted from 
22
and degraded the wilderness character of these 
23
backcountry areas.

H1755

•HR 1755 IH
(15) Federal agencies entrusted with managing 
1
the natural resources of the Northern Rockies Bio-
2
region operate under contradictory congressional 
3
mandates, and thus are in dissension over manage-
4
ment policies which involve common resources and 
5
greater ecosystems. Existing agency structures and 
6
regulatory mechanisms have proven unsatisfactory 
7
for responsible management of nationally important 
8
ecosystems on public lands. Existing laws and regu-
9
lations have not been sufficient to establish and 
10
maintain agency accountability for public resources.

rights.

TITLE II—BIOLOGICAL 
9
CONNECTING CORRIDORS 
10
SEC. 201. FINDINGS. 
11
The Congress makes the following findings: 
12
(1) The most recent scientific information on 
13
ecological reserve design and function, including re-
14
cent scientific information on species dispersal in re-
15
sponse to a changing climate, points out the critical 
16
need for biological connecting corridors between the 
17
larger core ecosystem areas. 
18
(2) While none of the remaining major wild 
19
land ecosystems of the Northern Rockies Bioregion 
20
appears to be of sufficient size to perpetuate the full 
21
complement of self-sustaining viable populations of 
22
native wildlife, biological diversity, and full range of 
23
ecological processes on its own, it appears that an 
24
effective reserve system can be achieved if biological 
25
16:55 May 11, 2021
H1755
154 
•HR 1755 IH
connecting corridors between the ecosystems are 
1
identified and protected. 
2
(3) The wild land areas addressed by this title 
3
are located between the major core ecosystems of the 
4
region and are essential for wildlife and plant migra-
5
tion and genetic interchange. 
6
(4) These areas are some of the most beautiful 
7
and wild mountain ranges in the United States, in-
8
cluding the Bitterroot, Sapphire, Lost River, Lemhi, 
9
and Bridger mountain ranges.

12
(a) DESIGNATION.—To protect the life flow of the 
13
Northern Rockies Bioregion, the areas described in this 
14
section are hereby designated as biological connecting cor-
15
ridors. The designated biological connecting corridors are 
16
of two types, areas designated as components of the Na-
17
