SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) United States persons have a reasonable ex-
3
pectation of privacy in the digital contents of their 
4
electronic equipment, the digital contents of their 
5
online accounts, and the nature of their online pres-
6
ence. 
7
(2) The Supreme Court of the United States 
8
recognized in Riley v. California, 134 S. Ct. 2473 
9
(2014), the extraordinary privacy interests in elec-
10
tronic equipment like cell phones. 
11
(3) The privacy interest of United States per-
12
sons in the digital contents of their electronic equip-
13
ment, the digital contents of their online accounts, 
14
and the nature of their online presence differs in 
15
both degree and kind from their privacy interest in 
16
closed containers. 
17
(4) Accessing the digital contents of electronic 
18
equipment, accessing the digital contents of an on-
19
line account, or obtaining information regarding the 
20
nature of the online presence of a United States per-
21
son entering or exiting the United States, without a 
22
lawful warrant based on probable cause, is unreason-
23
able under the Fourth Amendment to the Constitu-
24
tion of the United States.
