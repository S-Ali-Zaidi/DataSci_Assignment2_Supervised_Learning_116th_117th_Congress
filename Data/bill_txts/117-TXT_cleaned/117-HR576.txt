Whereas, although its roots go back further, the religion 
began to spread rapidly in A.D. 622 when the Prophet 
Muhammad (may peace be upon him) began his travels 
from Mecca to Medina, the first day of which began the 
Islamic calendar; 
Whereas Islam is the second largest and fastest growing reli-
gion of the world; 
Whereas it is estimated that there are approximately 
1,800,000,000 Muslims worldwide; 
Whereas Islam is a monotheistic religion, and Allah (meaning 
God in Arabic) is the central deity; 
Whereas Islam teaches Allah has 99 names, with each one 
having a different meaning; 
Whereas Islam is a complete system of strong moral convic-
tions that promotes peace, equality, and social justice; 
Whereas the fundamental Muslim practices are known as the 
Five Pillars of Islam; 
Whereas the five pillars are shahadah (declaration of faith), 
salat (prayer 5 times daily), zakat (give 2.5 percent of all 
earnings to charity), sawm (fasting in the month of 
Ramadan), and Hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Ara-
bia); 
Whereas the 5 daily prayers are designed to remove any bar-
riers between believers praying in congregations and 
helps one refrain from committing sins; 
Whereas the obligatory charity is designed to purify a person 
from selfishness and encourages empathy to the poor; 
Whereas fasting in Ramadan promotes self-restraint and 
spiritual renewal for Muslims worldwide;

Whereas the pilgrimage to Mecca serves as a unifying force 
in Islam by bringing followers of diverse background to-
gether in religious celebration; 
Whereas about 2,500,000 pilgrims visit Mecca each year for 
the Hajj, but in 2021 due to COVID–19, only around 
60,000 vaccinated Saudi Arabian residents will be al-
lowed over fears of the coronavirus; 
Whereas Muslims consider Islam to be a way of life; and 
Whereas carrying out these obligations provides the frame-
work of a Muslim’s life, and weaves their everyday activi-
ties and their beliefs into a single cloth of religious devo-
tion: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, To demonstrate solidarity with and support 
1

2
