Nagasaki before 1946, or were held as prisoners of war 
in or near Hiroshima or Nagasaki; 
Whereas July 16 is the anniversary of ‘‘Trinity’’, the world’s 
first detonation of a nuclear device in Alamogordo, New

•HRES 464 IH 
Whereas atomic veterans were not told of the hazards they 
faced from exposure to ionizing radiation, often were pro-
vided with little protection from such exposure, and were 
provided with no follow-up medical care or other moni-
toring to determine the health consequences of such expo-
sure; 
Whereas many atomic veterans were prevented by secrecy 
laws or oaths from seeking medical care or disability 
compensation from the United States Department of Vet-
erans Affairs (hereinafter referred to as ‘‘VA’’) for condi-
tions they may have developed as a result of radiation ex-
posure; 
Whereas in 1996, the United States Congress repealed the 
Nuclear Radiation and Secrecy Agreements Act, freeing 
atomic veterans to describe their military involvement in 
nuclear testing in order to file for VA benefits; 
Whereas atomic veterans may be eligible for free medical care 
from the VA and compensation in the form of a partial 
or full service-connected disability allowance, including 
potential payments to a surviving spouse or children; 
Whereas the National Association of Atomic Veterans was 
formed in 1979 to help atomic veterans obtain medical 
care and assistance; 
Whereas, on July 15, 1983, President Ronald Reagan did 
designate, in accordance with Public Law 98–54, July 
16, 1983, as ‘‘National Atomic Veterans’ Day’’; 
Whereas the Public Law 98–54 designated the single day of 
July 16, 1983, as ‘‘National Atomic Veterans’ Day’’ and 
not in each succeeding year; and
