SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds as follows: 
2
(1) The United States has the objective of sta-
3
bilizing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmos-
4
phere at a level that would prevent ‘‘dangerous an-
5
thropogenic interference’’ with the climate system as 
6
demonstrated by becoming a party to the 1992 
7
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
8
Change, pledging to China to reduce greenhouse gas 
9
emissions to 28 percent of their 2005 levels by 2025, 
10
and regulating greenhouse gas emissions from sta-
11
tionary sources, mobile sources, and electrical power 
12
suppliers. 
13
(2) To achieve this objective, the increase in 
14
global mean surface temperature should not exceed 
15
2°C (3.6°F) above preindustrial temperature by 
16
2100 consistent with the Paris Agreement that en-
17
tered into force in 2016. 
18
(3) The risks associated with a temperature in-
19
crease above 2°C (3.6°F) are grave, including the 
20
disintegration of the Greenland ice sheet, which, if 
21
it were to melt completely, would raise global aver-

age sea level by approximately 23 feet, devastating 
1
many of the world’s coastal areas and population 
2
centers. 
3
(4) A 2018 report by the Intergovernmental 
4
Panel on Climate Change demonstrated that limiting 
5
the temperature increase to 1.5°C will result in still 
6
harmful, but significantly less severe outcomes than 
7
a 2°C increase. 
8
(5) The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
9
Change projects that temperatures will rise 1.5°C 
10
between 2030 and 2052. In order to limit the tem-
11
perature increase to 1.5°C, global net anthropogenic 
12
carbon dioxide emissions must reach net zero by 
13
2050. 
14
(6) The 2018 National Climate Assessment, au-
15
thored by more than 300 experts and released by the 
16
United States Global Change Research Program, 
17
makes clear that the present unprecedented rises in 
18
global temperature are primarily due to human ac-
19
tivities. The changing climate will devastate all sec-
20
tors of society and disproportionately harm the most 
21
vulnerable communities. 
22
(7) Serious global warming impacts have al-
23
ready been observed in the United States and world-
24
wide, including— 
25

•HR 6351 IH
(A) increases in heat waves and other ex-
1
treme weather events; 
2
(B) rise in sea level, retreat of glaciers and 
3
polar ice; 
4
(C) decline in mountain snowpack, in-
5
creased drought (including droughts in the 
6
West and South United States) resulting in 
7
damage to our economy and property; 
8
(D) extreme weather conditions resulting 
9
in wildfires, stronger hurricanes, and polar vor-
10
tex occurrences resulting in further damage to 
11
property and our economy; 
12
(E) damage to our environment such as 
13
ocean acidification, extensive coral bleaching, 
14
migrations, and shifts in the yearly cycles of 
15
plants and animals; and 
16
(F) effects on human population, including 
17
population displacement and adverse health ef-
18
fects such as the spread of infectious diseases 
19
and climate-related conditions such as asthma. 
20
(8) Scientists project that under a midrange es-
21
timate of global warming, by 2050, roughly one- 
22
third of animal and plant species will be committed 
23
to extinction.

(9) After remaining steady from 2014 to 2016, 
1
global carbon dioxide emissions increased 1.4 per-
2
cent in 2017. 
3
(10) Decisive action is needed to minimize the 
4
many dangers posed by global warming. 
5
(11) The timing of such action is critical, given 
6
that greenhouse gases can persist in the atmosphere 
7
for more than a century. 
8
(12) With less than 5 percent of the world pop-
9
ulation, the United States emits approximately 15 
10
percent of the world’s total greenhouse gas emissions 
11
and must be a leader in addressing global warming. 
12
(13) The State of California, the 5th largest 
13
economy in the world, has shown that renewable en-
14
ergy standards and greenhouse gas emissions regula-
15
tion can reduce greenhouse gas emissions while fos-
16
tering significant economic growth. 
17
(14) Existing energy efficiency and clean, re-
18
newable energy technologies can reduce global warm-
19
ing pollution, while saving consumers money, reduc-
20
ing our dependence on oil, enhancing national secu-
21
rity, cleaning the air, and protecting pristine places 
22
from drilling and mining.
