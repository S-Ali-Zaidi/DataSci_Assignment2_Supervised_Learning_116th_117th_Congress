(a) DEFINITIONS.—In this section: 
3
(1) 
ENERGY
EFFICIENT 
4
ELECTROTECHNOLOGY.—The term ‘‘energy efficient 
5
electrotechnology’’ means— 
6
(A) any electric technology that, when used 
7
instead of a fossil fuel-fired technology in an in-
8
dustrial process results in— 
9
(i) energy efficiency, or production ef-
10
ficiency, gains; or 
11
(ii) environmental benefits; or 
12
(B) any electric technology that, when used 
13
instead of a fossil fuel-fired technology in an in-
14
dustrial application results in— 
15
(i) improvements in on-site logistics or 
16
material handling; and 
17
(ii) energy efficiency gains and envi-
18
ronmental benefits. 
19
(2) QUALIFIED ENTITY.—The term ‘‘qualified 
20
entity’’ means an industrial or manufacturing facil-
21
ity, commercial building, or a utility or energy serv-
22
ice company.

5
under the program established under subsection (b) to the 
6
owner or operator of a qualified entity for expenditures 
7
made by the owner or operator of the qualified entity for

an energy efficient electrotechnology that is used to re-
9
place a fossil fuel-fired technology. 
10
(d) REQUIREMENTS.—To be eligible to receive a re-
11
bate under this section, the owner or operator of a quali-
12
fied entity shall submit to the Secretary an application 
13
demonstrating— 
14
(1) that the owner or operator of the qualified 
15
entity purchased an energy efficient electrotechnolo-
16
gy; 
17
(2) the energy efficiency gains, production effi-
18
ciency gains, and environmental benefits, as applica-
19
ble, resulting from use of the energy efficient elec-
20
trotechnology— 
21
(A) as measured by a qualified professional 
22
or verified by the energy efficient electrotech-
23
nology manufacturer, as applicable; or

(3) that the fossil fuel-fired technology replaced 
1
by the energy efficient electrotechnology has been 
2
permanently decommissioned and scrapped; and 
3
(4) that all laborers and mechanics who were 
4
involved in the installation or maintenance, or con-
5
struction or renovation to support such installation 
6
or maintenance, of the energy efficient electrotech-
7
nology, or the decommissioning and scrapping of the 
8
fossil fuel-fired technology replaced by the energy ef-
9
ficient electrotechnology, and who were employed by 
10
the owner or operator of the qualified entity, or con-
11
tractors or subcontractors at any tier thereof, were 
12
paid wages at rates not less than those prevailing on

rebate under the program established under subsection (b) 
20
to an owner or operator of a qualified entity for expendi-
21
tures made by the owner or operator of the qualified entity

for an energy efficient electrotechnology that is used to 
23
replace a fossil fuel-fired technology if the Secretary deter-
