RESOLUTION 
Commending the bravery, courage, and resolve of the human 
rights and pro-democracy activists in Cuba one year after 
the historic march led by such activists through the 
streets of Cuba to exercise the fundamental right to 
peacefully assemble and speak out against the human 
rights atrocities committed by the brutal, totalitarian, 
and illegitimate Communist regime in Cuba. 
Whereas July 11, 2022, marked 1 year since the largest anti- 
government demonstration in Cuba when thousands of 
brave protestors took to the streets in more than 40 cit-
ies to peacefully demand access to fundamental freedoms 
and civil liberties and call for an end to communism, cen-

sorship, and the oppressive leadership of the Communist 
regime in Cuba; 
Whereas the regime, in an attempt to silence the Cuban peo-
ple, responded to the demonstration with a wave of ter-
ror, repression, and criminalization and detained and per-
secuted more than 1,400 protestors; 
Whereas more than 700 of such protestors, including chil-
dren, remain unjustly imprisoned and are subjected to 
torture and inhumane living conditions, with many of 
such protestors having been sentenced to decades-long 
prison sentences; 
Whereas the ongoing imprisonment of Jose Daniel Ferrer 
Garcia, a Cuban human rights and democracy activist 
who has worked tirelessly to advocate for fundamental 
civil liberties for the Cuban people, is representative of 
the tactics of the brutal and despotic regime; 
Whereas Garcia was among the hundreds of protestors who 
were unlawfully detained, were denied due process, and 
received unfair trials conducted by secret tribunals; 
Whereas, according to a statement by the family of Garcia 
in January 2022, Garcia was subjected to months of soli-
tary confinement, physical and psychological torture, and 
inhumane treatment from Cuban operatives, resulting in 
dire health conditions; 
Whereas Garcia has suffered from severe headaches, mouth 
bleeding, malnutrition, bouts of coughing, and the inabil-
ity to sleep; 
Whereas, more than 1 year into the unjust imprisonment of 
Garcia by the Communist regime in Cuba, Garcia con-
tinues to be subjected to brutal, torturous, and inhumane 
conditions by the regime, including isolation and confine-

ment to a small-walled cell with no access to natural 
light, denial of physical or verbal contact with family for 
months at a time, and denial of daily contact with other 
individuals; 
Whereas, according to the family of Garcia, Garcia is now 
suffering from breathing problems and vision loss and 
shows bodily signs of ongoing torture; 
Whereas the deteriorating and dire health conditions of Gar-
cia are directly attributable to the cruel and inhumane 
conditions to which the regime has subjected Garcia, sole-
ly for engaging in peaceful demonstrations and calling for 
freedom and democracy for the people of Cuba; 
Whereas hundreds of pro-democracy activists have been im-
prisoned solely for peacefully exercising their God-given 
right to freedom of expression, including— 
(1) Luis Manuel Otero Alcantara and Maykel 
‘‘Osorbo’’ Castillo of the San Isidro Movement; 
(2) Jose Diaz Silva of the Opposition Movement for 
a New Republic; 
(3) Arianna Lopez Roque of the Julio Machado 
Academy; 
(4) Emiyosian Roman Rodriguez, a 17-year-old who 
shouted ‘‘Patria y Vida’’ and was sent to a forced labor 
camp for 5 years; 
(5) Duannis Dabel Leon Taboada, a 22-year-old 
barber who was sentenced to 14 years; and 
(6) young women such as Lisandra Gongora 
Espinosa and the Garrido sisters, Loreto Hernandez and 
Donaida Perez; 
Whereas the illegitimate Communist regime in Cuba—

(1) is terrified of brave and courageous leaders who 
stand resolute in speaking out against the crimes against 
humanity committed by the regime; and 
(2) will persecute, kidnap, torture, and eventually 
kill anyone who stands up against the tyranny of the re-
gime; and 
Whereas, by working together, freedom-loving nations can 
help bring positive change and democracy to the people 
of Cuba: Now, therefore, be it
