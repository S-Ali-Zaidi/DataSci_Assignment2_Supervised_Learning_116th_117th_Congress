Whereas it is estimated that 30,000,000 dogs and 
10,000,000 cats die annually worldwide as a result of the 
dog and cat meat trade, and that a considerable number 
of the dogs and cats in this trade are stolen pets still 
wearing collars when they reach the slaughterhouses, in 
addition to stray dogs and cats who are captured for 
slaughter; 
Whereas there have been reports of abuse, poor living condi-
tions, and cruel slaughtering techniques for dogs and cats 
farmed for their meat; 
Whereas many dogs and cats die during transport to slaugh-
terhouses after days or weeks crammed into small cages 
on the back of vehicles without food or water, and others 
suffer illness and injury during transport; 
Whereas the extreme suffering of dogs and cats at such 
slaughterhouses and on transportation trucks would 
breach anticruelty laws in the United States and other 
countries; 
Whereas many government officials, civil society advocates, 
and activists including the World Dog Alliance are work-
ing to end the dog and cat meat trade. Taiwan and the 
Chinese city of Shenzhen have passed laws banning the 
consumption of dog and cat meat; the South Korean Gov-
ernment has formed the Consultative Discussion Com-
mittee on Ending Dog Meat Consumption in December 
2021; and 
Whereas legislators in the United States, United Kingdom, 
Japan, Norway, and Sweden have urged their heads of 
State in support of the International Agreement to Pro-
hibit the Eating of Dogs and Cats: Now, therefore, be it
