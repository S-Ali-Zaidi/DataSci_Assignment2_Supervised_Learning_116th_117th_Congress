SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
5
Congress makes the following findings: 
6
(1) The People’s Republic of China (in this sec-
7
tion referred to as the ‘‘PRC’’) and the Russian 
8
Federation have, in recent years, forged a closer re-
9
lationship, based largely on their shared interest in 
10
challenging the rules-based international order, in an 
11
attempt to reshape that order into one that is more 
12
welcoming to their authoritarian systems of govern-
13
ment. 
14
(2) On February 4, 2022, the PRC and Rus-
15
sian Federation issued a Joint Statement on the 
16
International Relations Entering a New Era and the 
17
Global Sustainable Development, which stated that 
18
‘‘friendship between the two States has no limits’’ 
19
and that ‘‘there are no forbidden areas of coopera-
20
tion’’. 
21
(3) In their Joint Statement, the PRC and the 
22
Russian Federation reaffirmed support for state sov-
23
ereignty and territorial integrity and called on all 
24
countries to protect international law.

(4) Per media reporting, leading up to Russia’s 
1
unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, United States offi-
2
cials held multiple meetings with PRC officials pre-
3
senting intelligence showing Russian troop buildup 
4
around Ukraine and requested Chinese assistance in 
5
urging the Russian Federation not to attack 
6
Ukraine. 
7
(5) A March 2, 2022, New York Times article 
8
reported that senior Chinese officials told senior 
9
Russian officials in early February 2022 not to in-
10
vade Ukraine before the end of the Winter Olympics 
11
in Beijing. 
12
(6) The New York Times reported that PRC of-
13
ficials later shared United States intelligence with 
14
Russia and stated that the United States ‘‘was try-
15
ing to sow discord and that China would not try to 
16
impede Russian plans and actions’’. 
17
(7) On February 21, 2022, President Vladimir 
18
Putin of the Russian Federation declared unilateral 
19
recognition of the Donetsk and Luhansk separatist 
20
regions of Ukraine and ordered Russian troops to 
21
enter those regions in a further invasion of Ukraine 
22
to carry out ‘‘peacekeeping functions’’. 
23
(8) On February 24, 2022, Russian forces 
24
launched an unprovoked large-scale further invasion 
25

•HR 6954 IH
of Ukraine with the goal of taking over major cities, 
1
including the capital city of Kyiv, by military force. 
2
(9) The PRC’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson 
3
refused to categorize Russia’s attacks as an ‘‘inva-
4
sion’’ and referred repeatedly to the Russian Fed-
5
eration’s statements on Ukraine. 
6
(10) On February 24, 2022, the PRC an-
7
nounced it would lift restrictions on wheat imports 
8
from Russia to ease the impact of sanctions on Rus-
9
sia’s invasion of Ukraine. 
10
(11) Russian forces are reported to have tar-
11
geted civilian population centers and launched at-
12
tacks without regard for civilian casualties, some of 
13
which may constitute war crimes. 
14
(12) On March 2, 2022, the Chief Prosecutor 
15
of the International Criminal Court announced an 
16
investigation into possible war crimes committed in 
17
Ukraine after a referral by 39 member states. 
18
(13) On March 2, 2022, Chinese Foreign Min-
19
ister Wang Yi recognized the conflict in Ukraine as 
20
a ‘‘war’’ and expressed that China was ‘‘extremely 
21
concerned’’ about the harm to civilians in Ukraine.
