SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The effectiveness of United States foreign 
3
assistance can be greatly enhanced by fostering in-
4
novation, applying research and technology, and 
5
leveraging the expertise and resources of the private 
6
sector to find cost-effective solutions to today’s most 
7
pressing development challenges. 
8
(2) Partnerships with entrepreneurs, experts, 
9
nongovernmental organizations, universities, and 
10
science and research institutions allow the United 
11
States to find solutions to specific development chal-
12
lenges in a faster, more cost-efficient, and more fi-
13
nancially sustainable way. 
14
(3) Enhancing the authorities that support re-
15
sults-based and pay-for-success innovation models 
16
will better enable USAID to diversify and expand 
17
both the number and sources of ideas that may be 
18
developed, tested, and brought to scale, thereby in-
19
creasing the USAID’s opportunity to apply high

value, cost-effective solutions to global development 
1
challenges. 
2
(4) As demonstrated by USAID’s Development 
3
Innovation Ventures program, innovation within 
4
United States foreign assistance can generate high 
5
social returns when it is centered on the creation of 
6
and reliance on rigorous evidence of impact on glob-
7
al development outcomes, a focus on cost-effective-
8
ness, and attention to financially sustainable scaling 
9
pathways. 
10
(5) Enabling uptake of evidence-based innova-
11
tion across USAID’s operating units will enable 
12
USAID to scale breakthrough solutions that accel-
13
erate economic growth and produce better develop-
14
ment outcomes, which can help support the growth 
15
of healthier, more stable societies and foster trade 
16
relationships that translate into jobs and economic 
17
growth in the United States. 
18
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
19
It is the sense of Congress that innovation is central 
20
to identifying solutions to global development challenges.
