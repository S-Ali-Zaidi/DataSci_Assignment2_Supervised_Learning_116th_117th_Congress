RESOLUTION 
Impeaching Joseph R. Biden, President of the United States, 
for usurping Congress’s legislative authority and willfully 
circumventing the express guidance of the United States 
Supreme Court by extending the COVID–19 eviction 
moratorium, and other high crimes and misdemeanors. 
Resolved, That Joseph Robinette Biden, President of 
1
the United States, is impeached for usurping Congress’s 
2
legislative authority and circumventing the express guid-
3
ance of the United States Supreme Court, and other high 
4
crimes and misdemeanors, and that the following Articles 
5
of Impeachment be exhibited to the United States Senate:

•HRES 596 IH 
Articles of Impeachment exhibited by the House of 
1
Representatives of the United States of America in the 
2
name of itself and of the people of the United States of 
3
America, against Joseph Robinette Biden, in maintenance 
4
and support of its impeachment against him for usurping 
5
Congressional prerogatives, disregarding and circum-
6
venting the express guidance of the Supreme Court, and 
7
for other high crimes and misdemeanors.

ARTICLE I: USURPING CONGRESS’S LEGISLATIVE 
9
AUTHORITY 
10
The Constitution provides that the House of Rep-
11
resentatives ‘‘shall have the sole Power of Impeachment’’ 
12
and that the President ‘‘shall be removed from Office on 
13
Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or 
14
other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.’’. 
15
Further, the Constitution states that ‘‘all legislative 
16
powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of 
17
the United States which shall consist of a Senate and a 
18
House of Representatives.’’. 
19
Whereas Congress has the authority to enumerate the 
20
powers, duties, and functions to be exercised by agencies, 
21
as well as directly counteract, through later legislation, 
22
certain agency actions implementing delegated authority. 
23
Whereas the Constitution outlines that the ‘‘executive 
24
Power shall be vested in a President of the United 
25
00:11 Aug 26, 2021
HR596
3 
•HRES 596 IH 
States.’’. Thus, the President serves as the chief executive 
1
officer of the executive branch of the Federal Government. 
2
Any regulations, guidance, or extensions made by execu-
3
tive departments are derived from the executive power of 
4
the President and are subject to his discretion. 
5
Whereas, in September 2020, the Centers for Disease 
6
Control and Prevention (CDC) issued an order tempo-
7
rarily halting residential evictions to stop the spread of 
8
COVID–19 under Section 361 of the Public Health Serv-
9
ice Act. According to the Department of Health and 
10
Human Services (HHS), Section 361 of the Public Health 
11
Service Act (42 U.S.C. 264) gives the Secretary of Health 
12
and Human Services the authorization to take measures 
13
to prevent the entry and spread of communicable diseases 
14
from foreign countries into the United States and between 
15
States. 
16
Whereas the CDC’s order was extended by the Biden 
17
Administration in March 2021 to remain in effect through 
18
June 30th, after which it was extended again through July 
19
31, 2021. 
20
Whereas Justice Kavanaugh expressed on June 29, 
21
2021, that Congress—and not the executive branch—is 
22
responsible for taking legislative action on the eviction 
23
moratorium in response to the COVID–19 pandemic. In 
24
fact, Justice Kavanaugh explicitly stated in his opinion 
25
00:11 Aug 26, 2021
HR596
4 
•HRES 596 IH 
that ‘‘in my view, clear and specific congressional author-
1
ization (via new legislation) would be necessary for the 
2
CDC to extend the moratorium past July 31.’’. 
3
Whereas, on August 3, 2021, the Centers for Disease 
4
Control extended their eviction moratorium until October 
5
3, 2021, in direct contradiction to Justice Kavanaugh’s 
6
opinion on June 29, 2021. 
7
By these actions, President Biden has demonstrated 
8
his manifest disrespect for Congress, the American people, 
9
and the rule of law by usurping congressional prerogatives 
10
explicitly enumerated in the Constitution and reaffirmed 
11
by the Supreme Court.

ARTICLE
II: 
DISREGARDING
AND
CIRCUM-
13
VENTING
THE
JUDICIAL
AUTHORITY
OF
THE
SU-
14
PREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES 
15
The Constitution provides that the ‘‘judicial Power 
16
of the United States shall be vested in one supreme Court, 
17
and in such inferior courts as the Congress may from time 
18
to time ordain and establish.’’. 
19
Whereas, on June 29, 2021, Justice Kavanaugh stat-
20
ed in his concurring opinion that the CDC’s eviction mora-
21
torium via administrative order ‘‘exceeded [its] statutory 
22
authority,’’ thus making clear that the nationwide morato-
23
rium via administrative order was prima facie invalid be-
24
yond July 31, 2021. Further, Justice Kavanaugh made 
25
00:11 Aug 26, 2021
HR596
5 
•HRES 596 IH 
clear that only an Act of Congress—in his words: ‘‘via new 
1
legislation’’—would be able to extend the moratorium be-
2
yond the end of July. 
3
In direct contravention to Justice Kavanaugh’s opin-
4
ion, President Biden empowered CDC Director Dr. Ro-
5
chelle Walensky to extend the moratorium for two months, 
6
forcing thousands of landlords to obey an order already 
7
declared to be circumspect by Justice Kavanaugh. 
8
Whereas congressional Democrats—the majority 
9
party in the House of Representatives that controls the 
10
schedule of legislative items brought to the floor for con-
11
sideration—failed to hold a roll call vote on the extension 
12
of an eviction moratorium before leaving for August re-
13
cess. 
14
Combine these facts with the ongoing rental assist-
15
ance provided by Congress and distributed in the State 
16
of Georgia over the last eight months: 
17
(1) The State of Georgia received $710 million 
18
through from the U.S. Treasury Department 
19
through the Federal Emergency Rental Assistance 
20
Program. 
21
(2) The Georgia Rental Assistance Program 
22
has distributed $14,118,327 to tenants and land-
23
lords as of July 28, which is 2.6 percent of the total 
24
amount of funds, according to the Georgia Depart-
25
00:11 Aug 26, 2021
HR596

•HRES 596 IH 
ment of Community Affairs, the State agency re-
1
sponsible for distributing the money to most Georgia 
2
counties. 
3
(3) Of the $710 million allocated to Georgia in 
4
the first round of funding, $552 million has gone to 
5
the State Department of Community Affairs, which 
6
oversees [several] housing programs in communities 
7
like Athens–Clarke that have fewer than 200,000 
8
residents. The rest of the money has been distrib-
9
uted by 12 local governments in larger communities. 
10
(4) Department of Community Affairs (DCA) 
11
Deputy Commissioner for Housing Tonya Curry de-
12
scribes: ‘‘We got the rental assistance in January, 
13
we stood up our portal on March 8, and we’ve been 
14
accepting applications ever since. I think that the 
15
perception is that there’s a slow rollout, but we’re 
16
receiving applications every day from citizens in 
17
need of these funds.’’ 
18
(5) Since starting, the program has paid out 
19
slightly more than $16 million to 4,950 households. 
20
In Athens–Clarke, they have received 400 applica-
21
tions and paid rent for 76 households, for a total of 
22
$449,800 paid out so far. 
23
(6) More than 22 percent of Georgia renters 
24
were not caught up on rent as of July 5, according 
25
00:11 Aug 26, 2021
HR596
7 
•HRES 596 IH 
to data from the Census Bureau, or more than 
1
340,000 tenants. According to information from the 
2
Athens–Clarke Magistrate Court office, there were 
3
134 evictions filed in June—the last month for 
4
which data was readily available—with 53 resulting 
5
in hearings. Evictions were expected to increase 
6
after the end of the Center for Disease Control mor-
7
atorium ended July 31, but a new moratorium ap-
8
plying to counties with widespread COVID went into 
9
effect August 3. 
10
Whereas the preceding facts demonstrate that suffi-
11
cient Federal funding for rental assistance has been pro-
12
vided, even while disbursement of the funds has lagged. 
13
Whereas, in his conduct as President of the United 
14
States, in violation of his constitutional oath to faithfully 
15
execute the office of President of the United States, and, 
16
to the best of his ability, preserve, protect, defend, the 
17
Constitution of the United States, and in violation of his 
18
constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully 
19
executed—Joseph Robinette Biden is guilty of usurping 
20
Congress’s authority to make law and circumventing the 
21
Supreme Court’s authority to rule on all cases arising 
22
under the Constitution. 
23
Wherefore President Biden, by such conduct, has 
24
demonstrated that he will remain a threat to national se-
25

HR596
8 
•HRES 596 IH 
curity and the Constitution if allowed to remain in office, 
1
and has acted in a manner grossly incompatible with self- 
2
governance and the rule of law. President Biden thus war-
3
rants impeachment and trial, removal from office, and dis-
4
qualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust, 
5
or profit under the United States.
