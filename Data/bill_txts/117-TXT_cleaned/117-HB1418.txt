A BILL 
To amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act 
of 1965 to provide grants to local educational agencies 
to establish ‘‘Family Friendly School’’ policies at 500 
elementary schools that align the school day with the 
work day to better support working families and to dis-
seminate the learnings from these model schools so that 
other local educational agencies may adopt these prac-
tices, and to establish a supplemental 21st century com-
munity learning centers grant program to support pro-
grams and activities during summer recess when school 
is not in session.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Family Friendly 
4
Schools Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Schools are shut down for an average of 29 
8
days throughout the school year, which is 2 weeks 
9
longer than the typical American with paid leave has 
10
in paid holidays and vacation. 
11
(2) Moreover, 39 percent of all workers, and 80 
12
percent of low-wage workers, lack access to any paid 
13
vacation time. 
14
(3) Most schools close at or around 3 p.m., 2 
15
hours short of the standard full-time work day. 
16
(4) Fewer than 1⁄2 of elementary schools and 
17
fewer than 1⁄3 of low-income schools offer before and 
18
afterschool care. 
19
(5) In communities across the Nation, 1 in 5 
20
school-aged children were unsupervised after school. 
21
(6) 
In 
2014, 
parents 
of 
approximately 
22
19,400,000 children who were not in an afterschool 
23
program said that their children would participate if 
24
a program were available.

•HR 1418 IH
(7) If families pay out of pocket for child care 
1
to cover the excess school closure days and the hours 
2
between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m., it would cost an average 
3
of $6,600 per year, or 9 percent of an average fam-
4
ily’s income. 
5
(8) Moreover, 73 percent of families report 
6
some difficulty in finding summer care. 
7
(9) Many working parents are forced to make 
8
job-related changes during the summer. In 57 per-
9
cent of families, at least one parent makes a change 
10
to their job that is likely to result in a smaller pay-
11
check, and in nearly 1⁄3 of families, both parents 
12
make a job sacrifice. 
13
(10) The misalignment of school and work 
14
schedules creates a significant strain on working 
15
parents and guardians, particularly mothers and 
16
Black, Latino, low-income, and single working par-
17
ents, and those with irregular schedules. 
18
(11) Misaligned school schedules cost the 
19
United States economy $55,000,000,000 in lost pro-
20
ductivity annually. 
21
(12) 1,000,000 women with elementary school- 
22
aged children work less than full time because of 
23
their caregiving responsibilities. 
24
18:24 Apr 06, 2021
H1418

•HR 1418 IH
(13) More than 8 in 10 parents of children in 
1
afterschool programs agree that afterschool pro-
2
grams help working parents keep their jobs. 
3
(14) More than half of families report a desire 
4
for their child to participate in a summer learning 
5
program. 
6
(15) Aligning school and work schedules is both 
7
an economic growth and child development strategy.
