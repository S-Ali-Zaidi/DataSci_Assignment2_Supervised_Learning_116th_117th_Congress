A BILL 
To require the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve 
System to collect more data on race and wealth, and 
for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Closing the Racial 
4
Wealth Gap Act of 2019’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds that: 
7
(1) Between 1983 and 2016, the median Black 
8
family saw their wealth drop by more than half after

adjusting for inflation, compared to a 33 percent in-
1
crease for the median White household. 
2
(2) The Forbes 400 richest Americans own 
3
more wealth than all Black households plus a quar-
4
ter of Latinx households. 
5
(3) Black families are about 20 times more 
6
likely to have zero or negative wealth (37 percent) 
7
than they are to have $1 million or more in assets 
8
(1.9 percent). 
9
(4) Latinx families are 14 times more likely to 
10
have zero or negative wealth (32.8 percent) than 
11
they are to reach the millionaire threshold (2.3 per-
12
cent). 
13
(5) White families are equally likely to have 
14
zero or negative wealth (about 15 percent) as they 
15
are to be a millionaire (15 percent). 
16
(6) The rate of home ownership for Black fami-
17
lies is the same today in 2019 as it was before pas-
18
sage of the Fair Housing Act of 1968. 
19
(7) The racial wealth gap is not an accident or 
20
the result of inadvisable financial choices by people 
21
of color, rather it is the result of the centuries of 
22
policies, programs, Supreme Court decisions and in-
23
stitutional practices that were designed to create 
24
barriers or to strip wealth from people of color.

(8) Adjustments to Black and Latinx education 
1
rates, homeownership, savings and employment do 
2
not greatly reduce the racial wealth divide due to the 
3
structural underpinnings holding the racial wealth 
4
divide in place. 
5
(9) To understand and address the racial 
6
wealth gap, many experts believe we need federally 
7
funded data collection efforts with the ability to 
8
disaggregate sample sizes by race, ethnicity, tribal 
9
affiliation, and country of birth. 
10
(10) Analytical tools like the ‘‘Racial Wealth 
11
Audit’’ from the Institute on Assets and Social Pol-
12
icy (IASP) and the ‘‘Racial Equity Toolkit’’ from 
13
the Government Alliance on Racial Equity (GARE) 
14
are needed to provide a framework to assess how 
15
legislation will widen or narrow the racial wealth di-
16
vide. 
17
(11) Changes in individual behavior will not 
18
close the racial wealth divide, only structural sys-
19
temic policy change.
