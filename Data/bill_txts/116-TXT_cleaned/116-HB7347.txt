(6) The Medal of Honor citation for Lieutenant 
1
Colonel Kettles states, ‘‘Major Charles S. Kettles 
2
distinguished himself by conspicuous gallantry and 
3
intrepidity while serving as Flight Commander, 
4
176th Aviation Company (Airmobile) (Light), 14th 
5
Combat Aviation Battalion, Americal Division near 
6
Duc Pho, Republic of Vietnam. On 15 May 1967, 
7
Major Kettles, upon learning that an airborne infan-
8
try unit had suffered casualties during an intense 
9
firefight with the enemy, immediately volunteered to 
10
lead a flight of six UH–1D helicopters to carry rein-
11
forcements to the embattled force and to evacuate 
12
wounded personnel. Enemy small arms, automatic 
13
weapons, and mortar fire raked the landing zone, in-
14
flicting heavy damage to the helicopters; however, 
15
Major Kettles refused to depart until all helicopters 
16
were loaded to capacity. He then returned to the 
17
battlefield, with full knowledge of the intense enemy 
18
fire awaiting his arrival, to bring more reinforce-
19
ments, landing in the midst of enemy mortar and 
20
automatic weapons fire that seriously wounded his 
21
gunner and severely damaged his aircraft. Upon de-
22
parting, Major Kettles was advised by another heli-
23
copter crew that he had fuel streaming out of his 
24
aircraft. Despite the risk posed by the leaking fuel, 
25

he nursed the damaged aircraft back to base. Later 
1
that day, the Infantry Battalion Commander re-
2
quested immediate, emergency extraction of the re-
3
maining 40 troops, including four members of Major 
4
Kettles’ unit who were stranded when their heli-
5
copter was destroyed by enemy fire. With only one 
6
flyable UH–1 helicopter remaining, Major Kettles 
7
volunteered to return to the deadly landing zone for 
8
a third time, leading a flight of six evacuation heli-
9
copters, five of which were from the 161st Aviation 
10
Company. During the extraction, Major Kettles was 
11
informed by the last helicopter that all personnel 
12
were onboard, and departed the landing zone accord-
13
ingly. Army gunships supporting the evacuation also 
14
departed the area. Once airborne, Major Kettles was 
15
advised that eight troops had been unable to reach 
16
the evacuation helicopters due to the intense enemy 
17
fire. With complete disregard for his own safety, 
18
Major Kettles passed the lead to another helicopter 
19
and returned to the landing zone to rescue the re-
20
maining troops. Without gunship, artillery, or tac-
21
tical aircraft support, the enemy concentrated all 
22
firepower on his lone aircraft, which was imme-
23
diately damaged by a mortar round that shattered 
24
both front windshields and the chin bubble and was 
25

further raked by small arms and machine gun fire. 
1
Despite the intense enemy fire, Major Kettles main-
2
tained control of the aircraft and situation, allowing 
3
time for the remaining eight soldiers to board the 
4
aircraft. In spite of the severe damage to his heli-
5
copter, Major Kettles once more skillfully guided his 
6
heavily damaged aircraft to safety. Without his cou-
7
rageous actions and superior flying skills, the last 
8
group of soldiers and his crew would never have 
9
made it off the battlefield. Major Kettles’ selfless 
10
acts of repeated valor and determination are in 
11
keeping with the highest traditions of military serv-
12
ice and reflect great credit upon himself and the 
13
United States Army.’’.
