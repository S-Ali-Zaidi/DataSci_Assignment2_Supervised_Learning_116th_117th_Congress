•HR 1857 IH
(4) INTERSEX.—The term ‘‘intersex’’ means in-
1
dividuals born with sex characteristics (including 
2
genitals, gonads, or chromosome patterns) that vary 
3

SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
10
Congress makes the following findings: 
11
(1) Around the world, LGBTI people face vio-
12
lence, discrimination, hatred, and bigotry. 
13
(2) Sixty-nine countries criminalize same-sex re-
14
lations and at least three countries prohibit the pub-
15
lic support of the LGBTI community. That is equal 
16
to 35 percent of United Nations member states. 
17
(3) In several countries, homosexuality is a 
18
crime that is punishable by death. 
19
(4) Intersex people experience prejudice and 
20
discrimination because their bodies do not conform 
21
to other people’s expectations about sex and gender, 
22
including the common performance of medically un-
23
necessary surgeries without the consent or approval 
24
of intersex individuals. 
25

•HR 1857 IH
(5) Violence and discrimination based on sexual 
1
orientation and gender identity are documented in 
2
the Department of State’s annual Human Rights 
3
Report to Congress. The 2017 report continues to 
4
show a clear pattern of human rights violations in 
5
every region of the world based on sexual orientation 
6
and gender identity. These violations include mur-
7
der, rape, torture, death threats, extortion, and im-
8
prisonment, as well as loss of employment, housing, 
9
access to health care, and other forms of societal 
10
stigma and discrimination. The report further docu-
11
ments LGBTI-specific restrictions on basic freedoms 
12
of assembly, press, and speech in every region of the 
13
world. 
14
(6) In Jamaica and other countries, discrimina-
15
tion against LGBTI people, including ‘‘corrective 
16
rape’’ of lesbian women, occurs all too frequently 
17
and with relative impunity. 
18
(7) In 2013, the Russian Duma passed a law 
19
banning so-called ‘‘homosexual propaganda’’, which 
20
effectively makes it a crime to publicly support 
21
LGBTI equality or even discuss homosexuality. This 
22
pernicious law is the basis for similar so-called 
23
‘‘antipropaganda’’ legislation in countries across 
24
00:42 Apr 05, 2019
H1857
5 
•HR 1857 IH
Eastern Europe and Central Asia, including in 
1
Moldova, Kyrgyzstan, and Belarus. 
2
(8) In December 2013, the Government of Ni-
3
geria adopted a law that further criminalized same- 
4
sex relations and support for LGBTI people, endan-
5
gering neighbors, friends, doctors, and landlords of 
6
LGBTI people. 
7
(9) Several countries in South Asia continue to 
8
have draconian laws that criminalize homosexual 
9
acts, which place LGBTI people in danger and un-
10
dermine their ability to live free from persecution. 
11
(10) In February 2014, the Government of 
12
Uganda adopted a law making ‘‘aggravated homo-
13
sexuality’’ a crime punishable with life imprisonment 
14
and concurrently, the Government of Uganda also 
15
passed laws severely limiting the basic freedoms of 
16
speech and assembly for LGBTI citizens. While the 
17
Constitutional Court overturned the Anti-Homosex-
18
uality Act on a technicality in August 2014, LGBTI 
19
Ugandans continue to be subjected to discrimination 
20
and violence, and their government has in recent 
21
years forcibly shut down even private Pride celebra-
22
tions in Kampala. 
23
(11) On April 1, 2017, the Russian newspaper 
24
Novaya Gazeta reported that the government of the 
25
00:42 Apr 05, 2019
H1857
6 
•HR 1857 IH
autonomous republic of Chechnya had been arrest-
1
ing, detaining, and torturing gay and bisexual men 
2
in secret prisons since early 2017. International 
3
human rights groups and Russian LGBTI rights ac-
4
tivists estimate that as many as 20 people may have 
5
been murdered thus far and potentially over 200 
6
people were detained during the purge. An OSCE 
7
factfinding report released in December 2018 con-
8
firmed the atrocities, documenting ‘‘several waves of 
9
violations of human rights abuses of persons based 
10
on their sexual orientation and gender identity’’. Re-
11
ports from early 2019 suggest the purge has contin-
12
ued. 
13
(12) On May 23, 2017, and again on July 13, 
14
2018, gay men were publicly caned in the Indo-
15
nesian province of Aceh, while thousands of spec-
16
tators snapped pictures outside a mosque as the bru-
17
tal punishment was meted out. Several times in 
18
2017, police in Indonesia have arrested men at pri-
19
vate parties, sometimes releasing their photographs 
20
to the news media, endangering their lives. 
21
(13) In September 2017, reports emerged from 
22
Azerbaijan that authorities had begun a crackdown 
23
on gay men and transgender women, arresting more 
24
00:42 Apr 05, 2019
H1857

•HR 1857 IH
than 60 and subjecting them to beatings, harass-
1
ment, torture, and blackmail. 
2
(14) From September through December 2017, 
3
over 70 LGBTI individuals were arrested in Egypt, 
4
with dozens receiving prison sentences of up to six 
5
years. In late 2017, authorities in Egypt instructed 
6
local media to delete any positive references to 
7
LGBTI people, and lawmakers proposed a bill that 
8
would criminalize LGBTI people and their allies. 
9
The arrests continued in 2018, with a Cairo-based 
10
LGBTI rights organization documenting 76 arrests 
11
for alleged same-sex conduct in 2018. 
12
(15) Anti-LGBTI laws not only endanger all 
13
LGBTI individuals, but also pose serious risks for 
14
those associated with or caring for LGBTI people. 
15
Studies have shown that when LGBTI people, espe-
16
cially LGBTI youth, face discrimination, they are 
17
less likely to seek HIV testing, prevention, and 
18
treatment services. 
19
(16) According to the Trans Murder Monitoring 
20
Project, which monitors homicides of transgender in-
21
dividuals, there were at least 369 cases of reported 
22
killings of trans and gender-diverse people between 
23
October 2017 and September 2018, an increase over 
24
previous years. The organization reports that a ‘‘ma-
25
00:42 Apr 05, 2019
H1857
8 
•HR 1857 IH
jority of the murders occurred in Brazil (167), Mex-
1
ico (71), the United States (28), and Colombia (21), 
2
adding up to a total of 2982 reported cases in 72 
3
countries worldwide between 1st of January 2008 
4
and 30th of September 2018’’. 
5
(17) According to the International Guidelines 
6
on HIV/AIDS and Human Rights, as published by 
7
the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
8
Rights, and according to the July 2017 report of the 
9
Independent Expert on protection against violence 
10
and discrimination based on sexual orientation and 
11
gender identity, countries should review and reform 
12
criminal laws and correctional systems to ensure 
13
that they are consistent with international human 
14
rights obligations and are not misused or targeted 
15
against vulnerable groups. 
16
(18) Removing institutionalized discrimination 
17
and targeted persecution against LGBTI people 
18
around the world is a critical step in the promotion 
19
of human rights and global health internationally. 
20
(19) Anti-LGBTI laws and discrimination pose 
21
significant risks for LGBTI youth who come out to 
22
their family or community and often face rejection, 
23
homelessness, and limited educational and economic 
24
opportunities. These factors contribute to increased 
25
00:42 Apr 05, 2019
H1857
9 
•HR 1857 IH
risks of substance abuse, suicide, and HIV infection 
1
among LGBTI youth. 
2
(20) On December 6, 2011, President Barack 
3
Obama released the ‘‘Presidential Memorandum— 
4
International Initiatives to Advance the Human 
5
Rights of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender 
6
Persons’’. The memorandum directed all Federal 
7
agencies engaged abroad to ensure that United 
8
States diplomacy and foreign assistance promote and 
9
protect the human rights of LGBTI persons. 
10
(21) On February 23, 2015, Secretary of State 
11
John Kerry appointed senior diplomat Randy Berry 
12
as the Department of State’s first-ever Special 
13
Envoy for the Human Rights of LGBTI Persons. 
14
Secretary Pompeo pledged to re-fill that position 
15
during his April 2018 confirmation hearing, but has 
16
yet to do so. 
17
(22) On June 30, 2016, the United Nations 
18
Human Rights Council passed a resolution cospon-
19
sored by the United States that established an inde-
20
pendent expert on violence and discrimination based 
21
on sexual orientation and gender identity to help 
22
monitor and track discrimination and violence expe-
23
rienced by LGBTI persons around the world.

•HR 1857 IH
(23) In November 2016, the Government of 
1
Tanzania placed a ban on all HIV and AIDS out-
2
reach projects aimed at gay men, including those 
3
funded by the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS 
4
Relief. This forced the closure of United States- 
5
funded programs providing testing, condoms, and 
6
care to gay men, exacerbating the health needs of 
7
gay men in Tanzania, about 30 percent of whom are 
8
HIV positive. In 2018, various government officials 
9
have announced crackdowns on the LGBTI commu-
10
nity, including a threat by the governor of the larg-
11
est city, who announced a purge on LGBTI individ-
12
uals and asked the public to report them. Reports 
13
suggest that many people have been arrested and 
14
more are in hiding. 
15
(24) In February 2017, three transgender 
16
women were murdered in El Salvador with impunity, 
17
leading the United Nations to call for an investiga-
18
tion into crimes against sexual and gender minorities 
19
in that country. A 2016 report noted that 
20
transgender women in El Salvador have an average 
21
life expectancy of less than 35 years due to violence, 
22
discrimination, and femicide. 
23
(25) Extreme violence in El Salvador, Nica-
24
ragua, Guatemala, and Honduras has driven LGBTI 
25

people to flee their countries or origin to the United 
1
States for protection. LGBTI people were among the 
2
first asylum seekers in the migrant ‘‘caravans’’ ar-
3
riving at the United States-Mexico border. 
4
(26) At the annual Summit of Commonwealth 
5
Nations in April 2018, United Kingdom Prime Min-
6
ister Theresa May issued an apology for discrimina-
7
tory laws criminalizing same-sex relationships that 
8
were imposed on British colonies around the world. 
9
She also announced the creation of a fund to sup-
10
port legal reform efforts. 
11
(27) In April 2018, Trinidad and Tobago’s 
12
High Court of Justice issued a landmark ruling de-
13
claring that laws which criminalize same-sex rela-
14
tionships between consenting adults are unconstitu-
15
tional. 
16
(28) In April 2014, the Supreme Court of India 
17
recognized transgender people as a third gender, im-
18
proving the legal rights of transgender people in that 
19
country. Though an important step, the decision 
20
does not grant full legal rights to transgender peo-
21
ple. 
22
(29) In September 2018, the Supreme Court of 
23
India issued a unanimous decision decriminalizing 
24
same-sex relationships across the country. The land-
25

mark case is likely to support similar legal chal-
1
lenges to colonial-era sodomy laws in other former 
2
British colonies, since the Indian sodomy law was 
3
the model used for other British colonies. 
4
(30) Angola decriminalized same-sex relation-
5
ships in January 2019, and prohibited discrimina-
6
tion against people on the basis of sexual orienta-
7
tion. 
8
(31) In January 2018, the Inter-American 
9
Court of Human Rights issued an advisory opinion 
10
declaring that the American Convention on Human 
11
Rights, adopted at San Jose November 22, 1969, 
12
grants the right of transgender people to change 
13
their name and gender on public documents, and 
14
that same-sex couples must be granted full legal 
15
rights, including the right to marriage. This ruling 
16
is animating legal reforms and human rights cases 
17
across the Americas. 
18
(32) In September 2018, the legislature in 
19
Chile passed a groundbreaking legal gender recogni-
20
tion law, which allows transgender individuals to 
21
self-determine their legal gender in official docu-
22
ments without a judicial determination or medical 
23
interventions. The Government of Uruguay passed a 
24
similarly expansive gender recognition law in 2018.
