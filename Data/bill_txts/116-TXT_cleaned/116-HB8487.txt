•HR 8487 IH
(1) all citizens should have equal access to af-
1
fordable and reliable energy to maintain personal 
2
health and economic security; 
3
(2) the United States should mitigate the dis-
4
parate impact of increases in the cost of energy on 
5
at-risk communities because such communities are 
6
more likely to have a fixed income and spend a high-
7
er percentage of their income on energy than the 
8
general population; and 
9
(3) to prevent energy poverty and to ensure 
10
that each at-risk community has access to affordable 
11
energy, the United States should ensure that laws 
12
relating to environmental and energy policy, includ-
13
ing the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 
14
(42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), the Endangered Species 
15
Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.), and the Mi-
16
gratory Bird Treaty Act (16 U.S.C. 703 et seq.), do 
17
not have the effect of increasing the cost of energy 
18
for any at-risk community.
