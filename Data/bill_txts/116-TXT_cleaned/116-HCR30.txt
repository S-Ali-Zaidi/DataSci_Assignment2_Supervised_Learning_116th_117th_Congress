CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the significance of equal pay and the disparity 
between wages paid to men and women. 
Whereas section 6(d) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 
1938 (29 U.S.C. 206(d)(1)) prohibits discrimination in 
compensation for equal work on the basis of sex; 
Whereas title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 
2000e et seq.) prohibits discrimination in compensation 
because of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex; 
Whereas over 5 decades after the passage of the Equal Pay 
Act of 1963 (29 U.S.C. 206 note), Census Bureau data 
show that women working full-time, year-round are paid 
80 cents for every dollar paid to men, while Asian-Amer-
ican women working full-time, year-round are paid 85 
cents, White, non-Hispanic women working full-time, 
year-round are paid 77 cents, African-American women 
working full-time, year-round are paid 61 cents, Native 
Hawaiian and Pacific Islander women working full-time, 
year-round are paid 59 cents, American Indian and Alas-
ka Native women working full-time, year-round are paid 
58 cents, and Hispanic women working full-time, year- 
round are paid 53 cents compared to White, non-His-
panic men; 
Whereas April 2, 2019, is Equal Pay Day, marking the day 
that symbolizes how long into 2019 women must work to 
make what men were paid in 2018; 
Whereas March 5, 2019, is Asian American and Pacific Is-
lander Women’s Equal Pay Day; April 19, 2019, is 
White Women’s Equal Pay Day; August 22, 2019, is 
Black Women’s Equal Pay Day; September 23, 2019, is

Native Women’s Equal Pay Day; and November 20, 
2019, is Latinas’ Equal Pay Day; 
Whereas if current trends continue, on average women collec-
tively will have to wait 40 years for equal pay, African- 
American women will have to wait 100 years, and His-
panic women will have to wait 205 years; 
Whereas the disparity in median annual earnings for women 
and men working full-time year-round is $10,169, which 
can add up to more than $400,000 over a career, and an 
estimated more than $1,000,000 in lost income for mil-
lennial women; 
Whereas women’s median earnings are less than men’s at 
every level of academic achievement, with women with 
less than a high school diploma earning 77 percent of 
men’s earnings, and women with an advanced degree 
earning 74 percent of men’s earnings at the same level 
of education; 
Whereas women are often paid less than men with lower lev-
els of education, with women with associate’s degrees 
paid less than men with a high school diploma, and 
women with master’s degrees paid less than men with 
bachelor’s degrees; 
Whereas, in the United States, mothers are breadwinners in 
half of families with children under 18, and mothers 
working full-time are paid 71 percent as much as fathers; 
Whereas median pay for women with disabilities was 72 per-
cent that of men with disabilities; 
Whereas the gender wage gap collectively costs women em-
ployed full-time in the United States more than 
$900,000,000,000 in annual lost wages, so that families

have less money to spend on goods and services that help 
drive economic growth; 
Whereas if the annual gender wage gap were eliminated, on 
average, a working woman in the United States would 
have enough money for approximately 13 more months of 
child care, 10 additional months of rent, 7 additional 
months of mortgage and utilities payments, the full cost 
of tuition and fees for a 2-year college, 7 additional 
months of premiums for employer-based health insurance, 
up to 8.4 additional years of birth control, more than 70 
weeks of food, or enough money to pay off student loan 
debt in just under 3 years; 
Whereas 
women 
hold 
two-thirds 
of 
the 
Nation’s 
$1,400,000,000,000 outstanding student loan debt, total-
ing over $890,000,000,000, and are less likely to be able 
to pay off their student loan debt promptly due to wage 
disparities; 
Whereas the wage gap impacts women’s ability to save for re-
tirement and women’s total Social Security and pension 
benefits, and older women are more likely than men to 
live in poverty; 
Whereas sex discrimination in education, hiring, and pro-
motion has played a role in maintaining a workforce seg-
regated by sex; 
Whereas sex-based wage differentials— 
(1) depress employee wages and living standards 
necessary for health and wellbeing; 
(2) reduce family incomes and contribute to the 
higher poverty rates among women and their families; 
and

(3) prevent the effective and maximum utilization of 
available labor resources; 
Whereas a wage gap exists in nearly every occupational field, 
but opening traditionally male jobs to women and reduc-
ing occupational segregation by sex increases earnings for 
women; 
Whereas nearly two-thirds of workers paid the minimum 
wage or less are women and the concentration of women 
in low-wage jobs is a significant contributor to the wage 
gap; 
Whereas the gender wage gap between union women and men 
is about half the size of the wage gap between nonunion 
women and men, and women union members typically 
earn $224 more per week than women who are not rep-
resented by unions; 
Whereas as much as 38 percent of the wage gap is unex-
plained by observable factors such as variation in edu-
cational attainment, industry, and occupation, and may 
reflect discrimination; 
Whereas two-thirds of private sector workers report that em-
ployers either prohibit or discourage them from dis-
cussing their pay, which can keep the existence of pay 
discrimination hidden and prevent remedying that dis-
crimination; 
Whereas the lack of family friendly policies, such as access 
to affordable, quality child care, paid family and medical 
leave, paid sick days, and fair and predictable work 
schedules, forces many caregivers to choose between pro-
viding for their families financially and ensuring their 
loved ones receive quality care, and contributes to the 
wage gap;

Whereas 60 to 70 percent of women have been on the receiv-
ing end of sexual harassment during their careers, and 
an estimated 87 to 94 percent of those who experience 
sexual harassment never file a formal complaint; 
Whereas workplace harassment forces many women to leave 
their occupation or industry, or pass up opportunities for 
advancement, and this contributes to the gender wage 
gap; 
Whereas equal pay strengthens the economic security of fami-
lies and enhances retirement savings; 
Whereas when women are paid fairly, families are stronger, 
businesses prosper, and American values and the econ-
omy are strengthened; 
Whereas if women in the United States received equal pay 
comparable with men, poverty for working women would 
be reduced by half and the economy would add 
$512,000,000,000 annually, based on a 2017 analysis; 
and 
Whereas numerous national organizations have designated 
Tuesday, April 2, 2019, as Equal Pay Day to represent 
the additional time that women must work to compensate 
for the average 20-percent lower wages paid to women 
last year: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate

concurring), That Congress—

(1) recognizes the disparity between wages paid

to women and men, and its impact on women, fami-
