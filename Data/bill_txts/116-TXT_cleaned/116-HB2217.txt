A BILL 
To reduce the ability of U.S. Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement to engage in inappropriate civil immigration 
enforcement actions that harm unaccompanied alien chil-
dren and to ensure the safety and welfare of unaccom-
panied alien children. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Families, Not Facili-
2
ties Act of 2019’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress makes the following findings: 
5
(1) On May 13, 2018, a Memorandum of 
6
Agreement between U.S. Immigration and Customs 
7
Enforcement, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol of 
8
the Department of Homeland Security, and the Of-
9
fice of Refugee Resettlement of the Department of 
10
Health and Human Services went into effect to 
11
allow for intergovernmental sharing of personal in-
12
formation about unaccompanied alien children, their 
13
prospective sponsors, and adult members of sponsor 
14
households. 
15
(2) U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforce-
16
ment is using information obtained under the Memo-
17
randum of Agreement to conduct civil immigration 
18
enforcement actions against individuals residing in 
19
the homes of prospective sponsors of unaccompanied 
20
alien children. 
21
(3) These civil immigration enforcement actions 
22
have discouraged prospective sponsors of unaccom-
23
panied alien children, including family members, 
24
from coming forward to resettle children in the com-
25

munity as they pursue lawful claims for humani-
1
tarian protection. 
2
(4) Onerous requirements for sponsors and 
3
raids carried out by U.S. Immigration and Customs 
4
Enforcement of sponsor households have discouraged 
5
qualified sponsors from coming forward, leading to 
6
unprecedented numbers of unaccompanied alien chil-
7
dren (approximately 11,705 in March 2019) being 
8
held in shelters overseen by the Office of Refugee 
9
Resettlement as of the date of enactment of this Act. 
10
(5) The Office of Refugee Resettlement is 
11
struggling to accommodate the growing number of 
12
unaccompanied alien children in its shelter network, 
13
resorting to placing children in temporary ‘‘emer-
14
gency influx’’ shelters. The Office contracted with 
15
BCFS to care for more than 6,200 children between 
16
June 2018 and January 2019 in a temporary shelter 
17
at the Tornillo-Guadalupe Land Port of Entry in 
18
Texas, a facility that the New York Times and other 
19
media sources described as a ‘‘tent city’’, and an-
20
nounced plans in January 2019 to nearly double the 
21
number of children held in a previously closed tem-
22
porary shelter in Homestead, Florida.

•HR 2217 IH
(6) Temporary shelters are inappropriate loca-
1
tions to hold unaccompanied alien children because 
2
such shelters— 
3
(A) have reduced standards of care, includ-
4
ing insufficient educational services; 
5
(B) offer limited access to clinical and 
6
legal services; and 
7
(C) are not cost-effective, resulting in the 
8
expenditure of more than $750 per day in tax-
9
payer funds for each child housed in Tornillo 
10
shelter, for example. 
11
(7) Facilities operated under a contract with 
12
the Office of Refugee Resettlement have faced unac-
13
ceptable allegations of abuse and neglect of unac-
14
companied alien children that merit additional inves-
15
tigation and oversight. 
16
(8) The Office of Refugee Resettlement is le-
17
gally required to place children in the least restric-
18
tive setting that is in the best interest of the child. 
19
(9) Services offered at facilities funded by the 
20
Office of Refugee Resettlement are required to in-
21
clude classroom education, mental and medical 
22
health services, case management, socialization and 
23
recreation activities, and family reunification serv-
24
ices that facilitate the safe and timely release of un-
25

•HR 2217 IH
accompanied alien children to family members or 
1
other sponsors that can care for them. 
2
(10) Providing legal and case management serv-
3
ices to all children while they are housed in a facility 
4
funded by the Office of Refugee Resettlement and 
5
after their release from such a facility is a cost-effec-
6
tive and humane way of ensuring that the Office of 
7
Refugee Resettlement meets its statutory obligation 
8
to place children in least restrictive settings.
