deter Russian aggression in the region;

Deterrence Initiative undertakes exercises, training, and 
rotational presence necessary to reassure and integrate 
our allies, including the Baltic countries, into a common 
defense framework;

led International Security Assistance Force in Afghani-
stan, sending troops and operating with few caveats; and

and troops to the Resolute Support Mission in Afghani-
