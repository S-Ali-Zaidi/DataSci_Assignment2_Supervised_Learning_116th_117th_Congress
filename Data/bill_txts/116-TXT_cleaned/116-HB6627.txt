•HR 6627 IH
(1) The World Trade Organization is a 164- 
1
member international organization that was created 
2
to oversee and administer multilateral trade rules, 
3
serve as a forum for trade liberalization negotia-
4
tions, and resolve trade disputes. 
5
(2) The United States was a major force behind 
6
the establishment of the World Trade Organization 
7
in 1995. 
8
(3) The United States, along with other coun-
9
tries, has sought to establish a more open, rules- 
10
based trading system in the postwar era, with the 
11
goal of fostering international economic cooperation 
12
and raising economic prosperity worldwide. 
13
(4) Congress holds constitutional authority over 
14
foreign commerce and establishes trade negotiating 
15
objectives and principles through legislation. 
16
(5) The statutory basis for the membership of 
17
the United States in the World Trade Organization 
18
is the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. 
19
3501 et seq.), and United States priorities and ob-
20
jectives for the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
21
Trade of the World Trade Organization have been 
22
reflected in various legislative measures providing 
23
expedited trade promotion authority since 1974.

•HR 6627 IH
(6) Congress has recognized the World Trade 
1
Organization as the ‘‘foundation of the global trad-
2
ing system’’ and plays a direct legislative and over-
3
sight role over the implementation of World Trade 
4
Organization agreements in the United States. 
5
(7) Ninety-eight percent of global trade is con-
6
ducted among members of the World Trade Organi-
7
zation. 
8
(8) Approximately 65 percent of the United 
9
States trade is with countries that do not have free 
10
trade agreements with the United States, such as 
11
with China, the European Union, and India, which 
12
thus relies on the terms provided in agreements of 
13
the World Trade Organization. 
14
(9) About two-thirds of the members of the 
15
World Trade Organization self-designate as ‘‘devel-
16
oping’’ countries. 
17
(10) World Trade Organization agreements 
18
allow countries to lower trade barriers gradually, 
19
with developing countries and sensitive sectors in 
20
particular usually given longer transition periods to 
21
fulfill their obligations under new agreements. 
22
(11) The World Trade Organization also sup-
23
plements such ‘‘special and differential’’ treatment 
24
for developing countries by providing capacity-build-

ing measures, providing technical assistance for the

Organization agreements, and permitting countries

to extend non-reciprocal trade preference programs

to such developing countries.

accrue to those members of the World Trade Orga-
