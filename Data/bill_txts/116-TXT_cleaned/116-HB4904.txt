A BILL 
To reduce spending on nuclear weapons and related defense 
spending and to prohibit the procurement and deploy-
ment of low-yield nuclear warheads, and for other pur-
poses. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Smarter Approaches

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 4904 IH
(1) The Berlin Wall fell in 1989, the Soviet 
1
Union no longer exists, and the Cold War is over. 
2
The nature of threats to the national security and 
3
military interests of the United States has changed. 
4
However, the United States continues to maintain 
5
an excessively large and costly arsenal of nuclear de-
6
livery systems and warheads that are a holdover 
7
from the Cold War. 
8
(2) The current nuclear arsenal of the United 
9
States includes approximately 3,800 total nuclear 
10
warheads in its military stockpile, of which approxi-
11
mately 1,750 are deployed with five delivery compo-
12
nents: land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, 
13
submarine-launched ballistic missiles, long-range 
14
strategic bomber aircraft armed with nuclear gravity 
15
bombs, long-range strategic bomber aircraft armed 
16
with nuclear-armed air-launched cruise missiles, and 
17
short-range fighter aircraft that can deliver nuclear 
18
gravity bombs. The strategic bomber fleet of the 
19
United States comprises 87 B–52 and 20 B–2 air-
20
craft, over 60 of which contribute to the nuclear 
21
mission. The United States also maintains 400 
22
intercontinental ballistic missiles and 14 Ohio-class 
23
submarines, up to 12 of which are deployed. Each 
24
15:51 Nov 02, 2019
H4904
3 
•HR 4904 IH
of those submarines is armed with approximately 90 
1
nuclear warheads. 
2
(3) The maintenance of this force comes at sig-
3
nificant cost. Between fiscal years 2019 and 2028, 
4
the United States will spend $494,000,000,000 to 
5
maintain and recapitalize its nuclear force, according 
6
to a January 2019 estimate from the Congressional 
7
Budget Office. This is $94,000,000,000 higher than 
8
the Congressional Budget Office’s 2017 estimate, 
9
with additional cost driven in part by the new nu-
10
clear weapons called for in the 2018 Nuclear Pos-
11
ture Review. Over the next 30 years, the price tag 
12
is likely to exceed $1,500,000,000,000 and could 
13
even approach $2,000,000,000,000. 
14
(4) Numerous United States Government offi-
15
cials have warned of the affordability problem posed 
16
by the current nuclear weapons sustainment plans, 
17
cautioning that these plans cannot be executed in 
18
the absence of significant long-term increases to de-
19
fense spending or cuts to other military priorities. 
20
For example, Brian McKeon, former Principal Dep-
21
uty Under Secretary of Defense stated in October 
22
2015 that: ‘‘We’re looking at that big bow wave [in 
23
nuclear weapons spending] and wondering how the 
24
heck we’re going to pay for it, and probably thank-
25
15:51 Nov 02, 2019
H4904

•HR 4904 IH
ing our lucky stars we won’t be here to answer the 
1
question.’’ Projected spending on the nuclear weap-
2
ons budget has grown even larger since 2015. 
3
(5) The projected growth in nuclear weapons 
4
spending is coming due as the Department of De-
5
fense is seeking to replace large portions of its con-
6
ventional forces to better compete with the Russian 
7
Federation and the People’s Republic of China and 
8
as internal and external fiscal pressures are likely to 
9
limit the growth of, and perhaps reduce, military 
10
spending. ‘‘We’re going to have enormous pressure 
11
on reducing the debt which means that defense 
12
spending—I’d like to tell you it’s going to keep 
13
going up—[but] I’m not terribly optimistic.’’, Alan 
14
Shaffer, Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Ac-
15
quisition and Sustainment, said in February 2019. 
16
(6) A substantial decrease in spending on the 
17
nuclear arsenal of the United States is prudent for 
18
both the budget and for national security. The De-
19
partment of Defense’s June 2013 nuclear policy 
20
guidance entitled ‘‘Report on Nuclear Employment 
21
Strategy of the United States’’ found that force lev-
22
els under the April 2010 Treaty on Measures for the 
23
Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Of-
24
fensive Arms between the United States and the 
25
15:51 Nov 02, 2019
H4904

•HR 4904 IH
Russian Federation (commonly known as the ‘‘New 
1
START Treaty’’) ‘‘are more than adequate for what 
2
the United States needs to fulfill its national secu-
3
rity objectives’’ and can be reduced by up to 1⁄3 
4
below levels under the New START Treaty to 1,000 
5
to 1,100 warheads. 
6
(7) A December 2018 Congressional Budget 
7
Office analysis showed that the projected costs of 
8
nuclear forces over the next decade can be reduced 
9
by $8,000,000,000 to $9,000,000,000 by trimming 
10
back current plans, while still maintaining a triad of 
11
delivery systems. Even larger savings would accrue 
12
over the subsequent decade. 
13
(8) Even without additional reductions below 
14
the New START Treaty limit of 1,550 deployed 
15
strategic warheads, the United States can save tens 
16
of billions of dollars by deploying those warheads 
17
more efficiently on delivery systems and by deferring 
18
production of new delivery systems until they are 
19
needed. 
20
(9) President Donald Trump is proposing to ex-
21
pand the role of, and spending on, nuclear weapons 
22
in United States policy at the same time that it has 
23
undermined critical arms control and nonprolifera-
24
tion agreements. The President has provided no 
25
15:51 Nov 02, 2019

6 
•HR 4904 IH
clear indication that the President intends to extend 
1
the New START Treaty. The potential expiration of 
2
that treaty will remove all limits on the size of the 
3
United States and Russian nuclear arsenals, height-
4
ening further the risk of unconstrained nuclear 
5
weapons competition and even greater spending on 
6
nuclear weapons.
