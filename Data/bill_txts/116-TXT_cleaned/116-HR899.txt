$4,000,000,000 to use to further their own educational 
advancement at colleges and universities across the 
United States; 
Whereas AmeriCorps members, after their terms of service 
with AmeriCorps end, have been more likely to remain 
engaged in their communities as volunteers, teachers, and 
nonprofit professionals than the average individual; 
Whereas AmeriCorps is a proven pathway to employment, 
providing members with valuable career skills, experience, 
and contacts to prepare them for the 21st century work-
force and to help close the skills gap in the United 
States; 
Whereas, in 2009, Congress passed the bipartisan Serve 
America Act (Public Law 111–13; 123 Stat. 1460), 
which authorized the expansion of national service, ex-
panded opportunities to serve, increased efficiency and 
accountability, and strengthened the capacity of organiza-
tions and communities to solve problems; 
Whereas national service programs have engaged millions of 
people in the United States in results-driven service in 
the most vulnerable communities of the United States, 
providing hope and help to individuals with economic and 
social needs;

best of the spirit of the United States, with people turn-
ing toward problems and working together to find com-
munity solutions; and 
Whereas AmeriCorps Week, observed in 2020 from March 8 
through March 14, is an appropriate time for the people 
of the United States—
