•HR 550 IH
(1) 2015 marked the 70th anniversary of the 
1
Allied victory in World War II and the restoration 
2
of peacetime across the European and Pacific thea-
3
ters. 
4
(2) The United States Merchant Marine (in 
5
this section referred to as the ‘‘Merchant Marine’’) 
6
was integral in providing the link between domestic 
7
production and the fighting forces overseas, pro-
8
viding combat equipment, fuel, food, commodities, 
9
and raw materials to troops stationed abroad. 
10
(3) Fleet Admiral Ernest J. King acknowledged 
11
the indispensability of the Merchant Marine to the 
12
victory in a 1945 letter stating that, without the 
13
support of the Merchant Marine, ‘‘the Navy could 
14
not have accomplished its mission’’. 
15
(4) President, and former Supreme Commander 
16
of the Allied Forces, Dwight D. Eisenhower ac-
17
knowledged that ‘‘through the prompt delivery of 
18
supplies and equipment to our armed forces over-
19
seas, and of cargoes representing economic and mili-
20
tary aid to friendly nations, the American Merchant 
21
Marine has effectively helped to strengthen the 
22
forces of freedom throughout the world’’. 
23
(5) Military missions and war planning were 
24
contingent upon the availability of resources and the 
25

•HR 550 IH
Merchant Marine played a vital role in this regard, 
1
ensuring the efficient and reliable transoceanic 
2
transport of military equipment and both military 
3
and civilian personnel. 
4
(6) The Merchant Marine provided for the suc-
5
cessful transport of resources and personnel despite 
6
consistent and ongoing exposure to enemy combat-
7
ants from both the air and the sea, including from 
8
enemy bomber squadrons, submarines, and mines. 
9
(7) The efforts of the Merchant Marine were 
10
not without sacrifices as the Merchant Marine bore 
11
a higher per-capita casualty rate than any other 
12
branch of the military during the war. 
13
(8) The Merchant Marine proved to be an in-
14
strumental asset on an untold number of occasions, 
15
participating in every landing operation by the 
16
United States Marine Corps, from Guadalcanal to 
17
Iwo Jima. 
18
(9) The Merchant Marine provided the bulk 
19
tonnage of material necessary for the invasion of 
20
Normandy, an invasion which, according to a 1944 
21
New York Times article, ‘‘would not have been pos-
22
sible without the Merchant Marine’’. 
23
(10) In assessing the performance of the Mer-
24
chant Marine, General Eisenhower stated, ‘‘every 
25

man in this Allied command is quick to express his 
1
admiration for the loyalty, courage, and fortitude of 
2
the officers and men of the Merchant Marine. We 
3
count upon their efficiency and their utter devotion 
4
to duty as we do our own; they have never failed 
5
us’’. 
6
(11) During a September 1944 speech, Presi-
7
dent Franklin D. Roosevelt stated that the Merchant 
8
Marine had ‘‘delivered the goods when and where 
9
needed in every theater of operations and across 
10
every ocean in the biggest, the most difficult, and 
11
dangerous transportation job ever undertaken. As 
12
time goes on, there will be greater public under-
13
standing of our merchant fleet’s record during this 
14
war.’’. 
15
(12) The feats and accomplishments of the 
16
Merchant Marine are deserving of broader public 
17
recognition. 
18
(13) The United States will be forever grateful 
19
and indebted to these merchant mariners for their 
20
effective, reliable, and courageous transport of goods 
21
and resources in enemy territory throughout thea-
22
ters of every variety in World War II. 
23
(14) The goods and resources transported by 
24
the Merchant Marine saved thousands of lives and

enabled the Allied Powers to claim victory in World 
1
War II. 
2
(15) The Congressional Gold Medal would be 
3
an appropriate way to shed further light on the serv-
4
ice of the merchant mariners in World War II and 
5
the instrumental role they played in winning that 
6
war.
