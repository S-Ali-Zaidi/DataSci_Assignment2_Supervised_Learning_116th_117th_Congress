(1) The Prevention and Public Health Fund 
1
(section 4002 of the Patient Protection and Afford-
2
able Care Act (42 U.S.C. 300u–11) was designed 
3
‘‘to provide for expanded and sustained national in-
4
vestment in prevention and public health programs 
5
to improve health and help restrain the rate of 
6
growth in private and public health care costs’’. 
7
(2) Funding under such section is essential to 
8
core efforts at the Department of Health and 
9
Human Services and in local and State health de-
10
partments to prevent and control the spread of in-
11
fectious disease, and prevent injuries and the devel-
12
opment of chronic conditions. 
13
(3) Prevention and Public Health Fund dollars 
14
support evidence-based investments in tobacco use 
15
prevention and cessation, nutrition, mental health, 
16
childhood lead poisoning prevention, elder care ini-
17
tiatives, and immunizations, among other prevention 
18
initiatives. Funding gives States and communities 
19
the flexibility to respond to public health threats 
20
that may be unique to their communities. 
21
(4) Such prevention efforts have shown to be 
22
effective. Funding increases for community based 
23
public health programs reduce infant deaths and 
24
preventable deaths caused by cancer, diabetes, and

cardiovascular disease. Every dollar spent on preven-
1
tion saves nearly $6 in health spending and every 
2
dollar spent on childhood vaccines saves $16.50 in 
3
future health care costs. 
4
(5) Investments in prevention reduce the cost of 
5
health care in the United States. $2,900,000,000 in 
6
investments in community-based disease prevention 
7
is estimated to save $16,500,000,000 annually with-
8
in 5 years.

(6) Cuts to the Prevention and Public Health 
10
Fund and other public health prevention efforts un-
11
dermine efforts to create an affordable and acces-
12
sible health care system, and a better quality life for 
13
Americans. 
14
(7) Restoring Prevention and Public Health 
15
Fund funding to $2,000,000,000 annually will allow 
16
the Fund to invest in more innovative, evidence- 
17
based public health programs and maintain and ex-
18
pand investments in programs with demonstrated 
19
success.
