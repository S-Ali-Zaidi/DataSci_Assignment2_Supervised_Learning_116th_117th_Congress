(a) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Certain areas of the United States tell na-
8
tionally significant stories; they illustrate significant 
9
aspects of our heritage; possess exceptional natural, 
10
cultural, scenic, and historic resources; and rep-
11
resent the diversity of our national character. 
12
(2) In these areas, the interaction of natural 
13
processes, geography, history, cultural traditions, 
14
and economic and social forces form distinctive land-
15
scapes that should be recognized, conserved, en-
16
hanced, and interpreted to improve the quality of life 
17
in the regions and to provide opportunities for public 
18

appreciation, education, enjoyment, and economic 
1
sustainability. 
2
(3) Local initiatives based on community and 
3
regional visions, involving public/private partner-
4
ships, are critical to conserving, enhancing, and in-
5
terpreting natural, historic, scenic, and cultural re-
6
sources related to our American heritage. These ini-
7
tiatives should be encouraged and supported by the 
8
Federal Government with the concurrence of the rel-
9
evant Federal land management agencies and tribal 
10
governments by providing financial and technical as-
11
sistance. 
12
(4) Partnerships among Federal, State, tribal, 
13
and local governments, nonprofit organizations, the 
14
private sector, and citizens provide the most viable 
15
framework to recognize, conserve, enhance, and in-
16
terpret the resources of places that have made im-
17
portant contributions to the national story. 
18
(5) Communities and regions need assistance to 
19
set resource stewardship and interpretive goals, and 
20
to implement strategies for resource conservation 
21
and renewed economic viability in these areas. 
22
(6) A unified national process as well as certain 
23
standards for designation of National Heritage 
24
Areas need to be established to provide a consistent 
25

•HR 1049 IH
framework. The process should include a system for 
1
approval of heritage area management plans. 
2
(7) National Heritage Areas located near or en-
3
compassing units of the National Park System pro-
4
vide an additional basis for public enjoyment of 
5
parks and park-related resources, and it is appro-
6
priate for these parks to participate in, assist with, 
7
and benefit from local heritage initiatives that con-
8
serve and interpret resources over a larger area be-
9
yond the park’s boundaries. 
10
(8) It is in the national interest, and will ben-
11
efit future generations, to establish a system of Na-
12
tional Heritage Areas to encourage natural and cul-
13
tural resource conservation, interpretation, enhance-
14
ment, and economic sustainability, and for full pub-
15
lic understanding and appreciation of the many re-
16
sources, places, events, and peoples that have con-
17
tributed to the rich heritage of this Nation. 
18
(b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this Act are to— 
19
(1) establish a system of regional and commu-
20
nity-based National Heritage Areas to conserve, en-
21
hance, and interpret natural, historic, scenic, and 
22
cultural resources that together tell nationally sig-
23
nificant stories representing our country’s heritage;

(2) promote public understanding, appreciation 
1
and enjoyment of the many places, events, and peo-
2
ple that have contributed to our diverse national 
3
story; 
4
(3) promote innovative and partnership-driven 
5
management strategies that recognize regional val-
6
ues, to encourage locally tailored resource steward-
7
ship and interpretation, to develop economically via-
8
ble and innovative approaches to community con-
9
servation, and to provide for the effective leveraging 
10
of Federal funds with State, local, tribal, and private 
11
funding sources; 
12
(4) provide unified national standards and proc-
13
esses for conducting feasibility studies, designating 
14
National Heritage Areas, and approving heritage 
15
area management plans; 
16
(5) provide appropriate linkages among units of 
17
the National Park System, and communities, govern-
18
ments, and organizations within National Heritage 
19
Areas to conserve, enhance, and interpret resources 
20
outside of park boundaries; and

(6) authorize the Secretary of the Interior to 
22
provide financial and technical assistance to local co-
23
