SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) The high cost of college textbooks continues 
8
to be a barrier for many students in achieving high-
9
er education.

(2) According to the College Board, during the 
1
2017–2018 academic year, the average student 
2
budget for college books and supplies at 4-year pub-
3
lic institutions of higher education was $1,240. 
4
(3) The Government Accountability Office 
5
found that new textbook prices increased 82 percent 
6
between 2002 and 2012 and that although Federal 
7
efforts to increase price transparency have provided 
8
students and families with more and better informa-
9
tion, more must be done to address rising costs. 
10
(4) The growth of the internet has enabled the 
11
creation and sharing of digital content, including 
12
open educational resources that can be freely used 
13
by students, teachers, and members of the public. 
14
(5) According to the Student PIRGs, expanded 
15
use of open educational resources has the potential 
16
to save students more than a billion dollars annually. 
17
(6) Federal investment in expanding the use of 
18
open educational resources could significantly lower 
19
college textbook costs and reduce financial barriers 
20
to higher education, while making efficient use of 
21
taxpayer funds. 
22
(7) Educational materials, including open edu-
23
cational resources, must be accessible to the widest
