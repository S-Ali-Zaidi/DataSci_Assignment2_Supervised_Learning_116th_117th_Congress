professionals teaming up with over 1.3 million members 
and supporters dedicated to advocating for our parks and 
inspiring future generations; 
Whereas the National Parks Conservation Association mis-
sion of ‘‘protecting and enhancing America’s National 
Park System for present and future generations’’ is as 
relevant today as it was 100 years ago; 
Whereas a century after its founding, the National Parks 
Conservation Association continues to act as a passionate 
and outspoken defender of America’s national parks and 
represents people from different backgrounds coming to-
gether to fulfill this unique mandate to steward our 
shared lands, independent of government and private 
business; 
Whereas the National Parks Conservation Association’s 
founders believed in the vision of the national parks as 
incredible places deserving protection and preservation 
for all people, and the National Parks Conservation Asso-
ciation is dedicated to ensuring that all people can share 
in this vision, regardless of gender, race, or beliefs; and 
Whereas the National Parks Conservation Association plays 
a vital role in protecting the places of unparalleled nat-
ural wonder, historical significance, and cultural value of 
the National Park System of the United States: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
