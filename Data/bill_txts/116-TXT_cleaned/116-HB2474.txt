A BILL 
To amend the National Labor Relations Act, the Labor 
Management Relations Act, 1947, and the Labor-Man-
agement Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, and 
for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Protecting the Right 
4
to Organize Act of 2019’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) The National Labor Relations Act (29 
8
U.S.C. 151 et seq.) was enacted to encourage the 
9
practice of collective bargaining and to protect the 
10
exercise by workers of full freedom of association in 
11
the workplace. Since its enactment in 1935, tens of 
12
millions of workers have bargained with their em-
13
ployers over wages, benefits, and other terms and 
14
conditions of employment and have raised the stand-
15
ard of living for all workers. 
16
(2) According to the Bureau of Labor Statis-
17
tics, union members earn 25.6 percent more than 
18
workers who are not covered by a collective bar-
19
gaining agreement. Workers who are represented by 
20
a union are 28 percent more likely to be offered 
21

•HR 2474 IH
health insurance through work and nearly five times 
1
more likely to have defined benefit pensions. The 
2
wage differential is significant for women and people 
3
of color. African-American union members earn 25 
4
percent more than African-American workers who 
5
are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement, 
6
and Latino union members earn 42.6 percent more 
7
than Latino workers who are not covered by a collec-
8
tive bargaining agreement. Women union members 
9
earn 30 percent more than women who are not cov-
10
ered by a collective bargaining agreement, and the 
11
wage gap between men and women is much smaller 
12
at workplaces covered by a collective bargaining 
13
agreement because collective bargaining agreements 
14
ensure the same rate is paid to workers for a par-
15
ticular job without regard to gender. The wage and 
16
benefit gains achieved through collective bargaining 
17
agreements benefit both workers and their commu-
18
nities. 
19
(3) Unions and collective bargaining ensure 
20
that productivity gains are shared by working peo-
21
ple. The decline in the percentage of workers covered 
22
by collective bargaining has contributed to sky-
23
rocketing income inequality and wage stagnation for 
24
the average worker. 
25

•HR 2474 IH
(4) The National Labor Relations Act protects 
1
the right of workers to join together with their co-
2
workers in concerted activities for their mutual aid 
3
or protection. This protection applies broadly to all 
4
concerted activities by workers aimed at improving 
5
the terms and conditions of their employment or aid-
6
ing each other in any way, regardless of whether 
7
workers are seeking to form a union or engage in 
8
collective bargaining with their employer. 
9
(5) The Act protects the right of workers to 
10
discuss issues like pay and benefits without retalia-
11
tion or interference by employers. However, the 
12
awareness of workers regarding their rights under 
13
the Act is lacking, due in part to the absence of any 
14
legally required notice informing workers of the 
15
rights and responsibilities under the Act. Many em-
16
ployers maintain policies that restrict the ability of 
17
workers to discuss workplace issues with each other, 
18
directly contravening these rights. Research shows 
19
that more than one half of workers report that their 
20
employers have policies that prohibit or discourage 
21
workers from discussing pay with their coworkers. 
22
These policies and practices impede workers from 
23
exercising their rights under the Act and impair 
24
their freedom of association at work. 
25

H2474
5 
•HR 2474 IH
(6) Retaliation by employers against workers 
1
who exercise their rights under the National Labor 
2
Relations Act persists at troubling levels. Employers 
3
routinely fire workers for trying to form a union at 
4
their workplace. In one out of three organizing cam-
5
paigns, one or more workers are discharged for sup-
6
porting or joining a union. 
7
(7) The current remedies are inadequate to 
8
deter employers from violating the National Labor 
9
Relations Act. The remedies and penalties for viola-
10
tions of the Act are far weaker than for other labor 
11
and employment laws. Unlike other major labor and 
12
employment laws, there are no civil penalties for vio-
13
lations of the National Labor Relations Act. Work-
14
ers cannot go to court to pursue relief on their own 
15
and must rely on the National Labor Relations 
16
Board to prosecute their case. Should the Board de-
17
cline to prosecute for any reason, aggrieved workers 
18
have no other remedy. 
19
(8) Unlike orders of other Federal agencies, the 
20
orders of the National Labor Relations Board are 
21
not enforced until the Board seeks enforcement from 
22
a court of appeals. As far back as 1969, the Admin-
23
istrative Conference of the United States recognized 
24
that the absence of a self-enforcing agency order im-
25
04:40 May 08, 2019
H2474
6 
•HR 2474 IH
poses wasteful delays in the enforcement of the Na-
1
tional Labor Relations Act, and recommended that 
2
the Board’s orders be made self-enforcing like those 
3
of other agencies. Congress did not act upon this 
4
recommendation, and delays in the Board’s enforce-
5
ment remain a problem undermining the effective-
6
ness of the Act. 
7
(9) Many workers do not currently enjoy the 
8
protections of the National Labor Relations Act be-
9
cause they are excluded from coverage under the Act 
10
or interpretations of the Act. 
11
(10) Too often, workers who choose to form 
12
unions are frustrated when their employers use delay 
13
and other tactics to avoid reaching an initial collec-
14
tive bargaining agreement. Estimates are that in as 
15
many as half of new organizing campaigns, workers 
16
and their employers fail to reach an initial collective 
17
bargaining agreement. 
18
(11) While the National Labor Relations Act 
19
guarantees workers the right to strike, courts have 
20
permitted employers to ‘‘permanently replace’’ work-
21
ers who exercise their right to strike. This is con-
22
trary to Congress’s intent in enacting the National 
23
Labor Relations Act and has led to confusion among 
24
workers regarding their right to strike. 
25
04:40 May 08, 2019
H2474

•HR 2474 IH
(12) Hearings under section 9 of the National 
1
Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 159) exist to assure 
2
to workers the fullest freedom in exercising the 
3
rights guaranteed by the Act. However, some em-
4
ployers have abused the representation process of 
5
the National Labor Relations Board to impede work-
6
ers from freely choosing their own representatives 
7
and exercising their rights under the Act. 
8
(13) So-called ‘‘right-to-work’’ laws do not give 
9
any worker the right to a job. While Federal law re-
10
quires unions to fairly represent all members of a 
11
given bargaining unit, and thereby expend resources 
12
on all unit members, many States’ so-called ‘‘right- 
13
to-work’’ laws prohibit unions from charging all 
14
members for the representation and services that the 
15
unions are legally obliged to render. Section 14(b) of 
16
the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 
17
164(b)) must be reformed to permit unions and em-
18
ployers to mutually agree that payment of fair share 
19
fees shall be a condition of employment following ini-
20
tial hiring. 
21
(14) Restrictions on so-called ‘‘secondary boy-
22
cotts’’ and ‘‘recognitional picketing’’ unduly impede 
23
workers’ ability to engage in peaceful conduct and 
24
expression. Workers must be free to act in solidarity 
25

H2474

•HR 2474 IH
with workers in other workplaces in order to improve 
1
labor standards and achieve other lawful ends for 
2
mutual aid or protection. 
3
(15) In order to make the right to collective 
4
bargaining and freedom of association in the work-
5
place a reality for workers, the National Labor Rela-
6
tions Act must be strengthened.

SEC. 3. PURPOSES. 
8
The purposes of this Act are— 
9
(1) to strengthen protections for workers en-
10
gaged in collective bargaining to improve their 
11
wages, hours, and terms and conditions of employ-
12
ment; 
13
(2) to expand coverage under the National 
14
Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 151 et seq.) to more 
15
workers; 
16
(3) to provide a process by which workers and 
17
employers can successfully negotiate an initial collec-
18
tive bargaining agreement; 
19
(4) to provide a stronger deterrent and fairer 
20
remedies for workers who face retaliation, discrimi-
21
nation, or other interference with their legal rights 
22
to act concertedly, join a union, or engage in collec-
23
tive bargaining; 
24
04:40 May 08, 2019
H2474
9 
•HR 2474 IH
(5) to broadly protect workers’ right to engage 
1
in concerted activities for mutual aid or protection; 
2
(6) to streamline the enforcement procedures of 
3
the National Labor Relations Board to provide for 
4
more timely and effective enforcement of the law; 
5
(7) to safeguard the right to strike by prohib-
6
iting ‘‘permanent replacement’’ of striking workers; 
7
(8) to repeal specific prohibitions on collective 
8
action and peaceful expression; 
9
(9) to permit fair share fee arrangements in 
10
order to promote workers’ freedom of association 
11
and encourage the practice of collective bargaining; 
12
(10) to improve the purchasing power of wage 
13
earners in industry; 
14
(11) to promote the stabilization of fair wage 
15
rates and humane working conditions within and be-
16
tween industries; and 
17
(12) to redress the inequality of bargaining 
18
power between workers and employers.
