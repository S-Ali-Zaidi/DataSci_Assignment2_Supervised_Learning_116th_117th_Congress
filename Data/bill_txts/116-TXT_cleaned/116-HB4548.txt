SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Asthma has a high morbidity and can even 
3
lead to death if not properly managed. 
4
(2) Nationally, over 25 million people suffer 
5
from asthma according to the most recent statistics 
6
from the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
7
tion. 
8
(3) Nationally, of those who suffer from asth-
9
ma, 43.6 percent of adults report one or more asth-
10
ma attacks annually, and of all children who suffer 
11
from asthma, 51.6 percent report one or more asth-
12
ma attacks annually. 
13
(4) Nationally the prevalence of asthma among 
14
children is 8.4 percent. 
15
(5) When asthma is controlled, it can lead to 
16
fewer school and work days missed, hospitalizations, 
17
and emergency room visits. 
18
(6) While asthma is often believed to be a 
19
greater problem for urban centers, the burden of 
20
asthma on rural communities in the United States 
21
is understudied. 
22
(7) Some research suggests that certain rural 
23
areas face the same risk factors as cities. 
24
(8) Research shows that rural communities may 
25
have a harder time accessing care for asthma, due 
26

•HR 4548 IH
to lack of transportation to and the distance of resi-
1
dents from health care services. 
2
(9) Mobile asthma clinics have been proven to 
3
help medically underserved communities manage this 
4
disease while providing cost-saving measures.
