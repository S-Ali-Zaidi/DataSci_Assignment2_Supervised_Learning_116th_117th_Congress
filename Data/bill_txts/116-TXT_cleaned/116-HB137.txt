•HR 137 IH
(1) chief State election administration officials 
1
have served on political campaigns for Federal can-
2
didates whose elections those officials will supervise; 
3
(2) such partisan activity by the chief State 
4
election 
administration 
official, 
an 
individual 
5
charged with certifying the validity of an election, 
6
represents a fundamental conflict of interest that 
7
may prevent the official from ensuring a fair and ac-
8
curate election; 
9
(3) this conflict impedes the legal duty of chief 
10
State election administration officials to supervise 
11
Federal elections, undermines the integrity of Fed-
12
eral elections, and diminishes the people’s confidence 
13
in our electoral system by casting doubt on the re-
14
sults of Federal elections; 
15
(4) the Supreme Court has long recognized that 
16
Congress’s power to regulate Congressional elections 
17
under Article I, Section 4, Clause 1 of the Constitu-
18
tion is both plenary and powerful; and 
19
(5) the Supreme Court and numerous appellate 
20
courts have recognized that the broad power given to 
21
Congress over Congressional elections extends to 
22
Presidential elections.
