RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the important role Victory Gardens played in 
America’s World War efforts and reaffirming their pur-
pose as essential to strengthening food security, health 
education, and community morale during the 2020 
Coronavirus disease (COVID–19) crisis. 
Whereas during World War I and World War II, the Victory 
Garden campaign called on Americans to plant vegetable, 
fruit, and herb gardens in whatever space they had avail-
able to implement a valuable and self-sufficient means to 
prevent potential food shortages; 
Whereas so many patriotic Americans participated in the 
movement during WWII, it is estimated that home, 
school, and community gardeners produced close to 40

percent of the Nation’s fresh vegetables from 20 million 
gardens; 
Whereas the forces at work in the global Coronavirus pan-
demic disrupt global food supply chains and leave Amer-
ican consumers vulnerable, many individuals are hindered 
from accessing even local food resources such as farmers’ 
markets, State fairs, and other community supported ag-
riculture, due to social distancing guidelines; 
Whereas Americans have been asked to follow social 
distancing guidelines and shelter in their homes to flatten 
the curve in the COVID–19 crisis; 
Whereas many will find the extra time at home provides a 
ripe opportunity for engagement in gardening as a hobby, 
as a food source, and as a means to promote stable phys-
ical and mental health; 
Whereas existing community gardens are investments in 
neighborhood revitalization, provide local sources of 
produce, and most importantly help restore fresh foods to 
underserved food desert communities, while inspiring and 
teaching children to gain a tangible appreciation for the 
power of nature to sustain life and improve health out-
comes through gardening; 
Whereas spring 2020 has already seen significant increased 
demand at garden stores, centers, and suppliers; 
Whereas supporting the growth of healthy and fresh fruits, 
vegetables, and herbs at home, through our education 
systems, in community gardens, and through all health 
care providers can play a fundamental role to amplify the 
benefits of healthy food options as nature’s best medicine 
and help citizens improve overall health, ultimately reduc-

mortality rate among COVID–19 patients; 
Whereas increased access to local healthy food options builds 
resiliency in individuals and communities; and 
Whereas promoting Victory Gardens can improve citizen mo-
rale during this harrowing global experience by rallying 
citizens to a healthy, productive, and patriotic activity 
which can benefit whole communities: Now, therefore, be 
it
