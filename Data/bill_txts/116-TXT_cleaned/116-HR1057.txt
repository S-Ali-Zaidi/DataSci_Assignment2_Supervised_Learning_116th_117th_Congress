RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
in order to effectively address the high prevalence of 
those suffering from mental health conditions and sub-
stance use disorders, the United States needs to make 
historic financial investments into mental health and sub-
stance use disorder care and finally acknowledge such 
care as a priority in health care equal to physical health, 
and for other purposes. 
Whereas there is an urgent need to improve our health care 
system to better integrate mental health and substance 
use disorders so they are no longer seen separately;

•HRES 1057 IH 
Whereas according to the World Health Organization, mental 
illness is severely underdiagnosed, and less than half of 
those who meet diagnostic criteria are identified; 
Whereas there is a pressing need to provide a comprehensive 
solution to fix our health system that incorporates the 
needs and expertise of all its stakeholders, especially 
those who have expertise in mental health and substance 
use disorders; 
Whereas it is essential to remove the misguided association 
between mental illness and violence driven by fear and 
misunderstanding; 
Whereas mental illness and substance use disorders have 
been underresearched, undertreated, and overstigmatized; 
Whereas stigma, vilification, and dismissal of mental illness 
and substance use— 
(1) create a culture that— 
(A) discourages utilization of mental health and 
substance use disorder services; and 
(B) lacks acknowledgment that struggling with 
mental health conditions or substance use disorder is 
not something to be ashamed of; and 
(2) can vary in prominence in different cultures and 
communities, and are particularly high among commu-
nities of color and minority communities; 
Whereas men in particular face cultural and societal barriers 
to seeking treatment for mental health concerns and sub-
stance use disorders, which can contribute to concerning 
outcomes including suicide and aggressive behaviors; 
Whereas the bulk of our mental health and substance use dis-
order services are reactive instead of proactive, treating 
patients when they are in crisis instead of incorporating

•HRES 1057 IH 
services and screenings earlier in an attempt to prevent 
such crisis from occurring; 
Whereas there is a need to increase access to treatment, serv-
ices, and social supports for everyone to proactively ad-
dress root causes of mental illness and substance use dis-
orders; 
Whereas it is necessary to address the root causes of mental 
health concerns and substance use disorders; 
Whereas it is necessary to address suicide in a holistic man-
ner and recognize and address suicide ideation and not 
just the action in isolation; 
Whereas there is a need to address social determinants of 
health, which are conditions that directly and indirectly 
affect the health, health care, and wellness of individuals 
and communities, in order to effectively provide care for 
all individuals living with mental illness and substance 
use disorders; 
Whereas mental health impacts physical health, and physical 
health impacts mental health; 
Whereas the current health care system does not adequately 
incorporate mental health and substance use disorders 
into the assessment or delivery of care, as evidenced by 
the fact that all vital signs are currently for physical 
health alone and do not touch on mental health or sub-
stance use disorders; 
Whereas the lack of a united approach across the Federal 
Government to improve mental health and substance use 
disorders has left States and localities— 
(1) without adequate guidance or resources; 
01:52 Jul 22, 2020
HR1057
4 
•HRES 1057 IH 
(2) without resources unable to provide the mental 
health and substance use disorder services needed to ade-
quately meet the needs of their populations; and 
(3) with resources unable to effectively distribute 
services to adequately meet the needs of their popu-
lations; 
Whereas there is a need for greater collaboration across all 
Federal departments that touches various aspects of the 
health care system in order to fully incorporate the needs 
and concerns of everyone involved in the mental health 
and substance use disorder system; 
Whereas there is a need for greater collaboration between 
Federal, State, and local departments that touches on 
various aspects of the health care system; 
Whereas there is a need for one centralized location within 
the Federal Government for good, reliable information on 
mental health and substance use disorders for providers, 
patients, and caregivers; 
Whereas there is a need for standardized definitions, stand-
ards of care, and metrics for mental health and substance 
use disorders across disciplines; 
Whereas there is a need to change incentives for providers to 
better ensure everyone with mental health and substance 
use disorders needs gets access to the necessary care and 
treatment; 
Whereas the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equality 
Act has been in effect since 2008, and 12 years later 
there is still a lack of compliance among insurers not 
adequately covering mental health and substance use dis-
order services; 
01:52 Jul 22, 2020
HR1057

•HRES 1057 IH 
Whereas Medicaid is the single largest payer of mental health 
and substance use disorder services, and reimbursement 
is far from adequate; 
Whereas there is a need to incentivize payers to adequately 
cover mental health and substance use disorder services 
in the same manner that all specialty services are cov-
ered; 
Whereas there is a need to increase the number of mental 
health and substance use disorder providers; 
Whereas 55 percent of counties in the United States do not 
have a single psychiatrist, psychologist, or social worker; 
Whereas only 10 percent of people suffering from a substance 
use disorder receive specialty treatment; 
Whereas there is a need to increase access and utilization to 
telemedicine for mental health and substance use disorder 
services both within States and across State lines; 
Whereas patient privacy needs to be protected, but there 
needs to be a better way to share information among pro-
viders to better serve the patient’s needs; 
Whereas safe housing needs to be recognized as a basic re-
quirement for treatment to be successful and needs to be 
better addressed as people transition care; 
Whereas there is a need to improve social determinants of 
health, such as increased access to stable housing and 
jobs, for those suffering from mental illness and sub-
stance use disorders to have a sustained recovery; 
Whereas there is a need to provide care in more appropriate 
and integrated settings for all patients, such as treating 
geriatric patients in their homes as opposed to nursing 
homes, when appropriate and in compliance with the 
01:52 Jul 22, 2020
HR1057

•HRES 1057 IH 
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (Public Law 
101–336) and the Supreme Court’s Olmstead v. L.C. de-
cision; 
Whereas there is a need for greater focus on intensive out-
patient, partial hospitalizations, residential programs, day 
programs, supported housing, assertive community treat-
ment, mobile crisis services, peer support services, sup-
ported employment, and community-based services for 
adults with mental illness and substance use disorders; 
Whereas there is a need to ensure that services support indi-
viduals with mental health conditions and substance use 
disorders to participate fully in their communities and 
live and thrive independently 
Whereas there needs to be consistent care coordination and 
more effective transition services for those moving be-
tween hospitals and the community; 
Whereas there is a need to address isolation issues geriatric 
patients face which can negatively impact their mental 
health; 
Whereas depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, and psy-
chosis are some of the most common conditions women 
experience pre- and postpartum; 
Whereas unmet parental mental health and substance use 
disorder treatment and service needs contribute to in-
creased involvement with the child welfare system, which 
leads to preventable foster care placements, given that— 
(1) in 2018, 262,956 children entered foster care, 
with the leading reasons related to mental health and 
substance use disorder needs of the parents, with— 
(A) 36 percent of children entering care as a 
result of parental drug abuse; 
01:52 Jul 22, 2020
HR1057
7 
•HRES 1057 IH 
(B) 14 percent of children entering care as a 
result of the caretaker’s inability to cope; and 
(C) 5 percent of children entering care as a re-
sult of parental alcohol abuse; 
(2) even when necessary to ensure a child’s safety, 
foster care itself creates additional trauma for both the 
child and family; and 
(3) longstanding racial inequities in child welfare 
services create disproportionate child welfare involvement 
for Black, Native, and Latinx children and families, 
which exacerbates those families’ experiences of trauma 
and contribute to health disparities while not resulting in 
needed access to quality mental health and substance use 
disorder services; 
Whereas children and adolescents have unique needs when it 
comes to mental health and substance use disorders and 
the services provided, given that— 
(1) 45 percent of children have experienced adverse 
childhood experiences which have the potential to signifi-
cantly impact the mental health of children; 
(2) in the last 12 months, 49.4 percent of children 
who needed mental health services did not receive the 
necessary services, and there needs to be improved access 
to more appropriate treatment services, which must focus 
on community-based supports and services available near 
their home, in order to effectively prevent children from 
experiencing a mental health crisis; 
(3) many children suffering and struggling go 
undiagnosed and are not adequately supported, and there 
is a need to improve training and understanding of men-
tal health and substance use disorder concerns for edu-
cators since often there are barriers to mental health and 
substance use disorder treatment in a school setting; 
01:52 Jul 22, 2020
HR1057

•HRES 1057 IH 
(4) 42 percent of school districts have reported using 
threat assessment and risk assessment teams, an ap-
proach created by the United States Secret Service that 
involves identifying, evaluating, and taking action on cur-
rent or potential threats which— 
(A) can cause significant harm to the mental 
health and emotional well-being of children; 
(B) has compounded already existent stigma for 
groups of students; 
(C) has had a disproportionate impact on stu-
dents of color by initiating justice involvement in 
lieu of more appropriate services; and 
(D) has had a disproportionate impact on stu-
dents with disabilities; 
(5) families and caregivers need to be included when 
treating children suffering from mental illness and sub-
stance use disorders; and 
(6) when children turn 18 they are cut off from 
mental health and substance use disorder services which 
impacts continuity of care; 
Whereas there is a growing need for mental health and sub-
stance use disorder services amongst young adults and 
college-aged adults, and between 2007 and 2017, for 
those aged 18–34 there was a— 
(1) 108-percent increase in drug-related deaths; 
(2) 69-percent increase in alcohol-induced deaths; 
and 
(3) 35-percent increase in suicide deaths; 
Whereas despite the rising need for mental health and sub-
stance use disorder treatment by young adults, there con-
tinues to be disparities in accessing care experienced by 
young adults of color;

Whereas 5.5 million veterans and servicemembers rely on the 
Department of Veterans Affairs for health services, and 
1.5 million veterans have received a mental health diag-
nosis, and— 
(1) 1 in 4 active duty members shows signs of men-
tal health conditions; 
(2) the rate of post-traumatic stress disorder 
(PTSD) is 15 times higher in servicemembers than com-
pared to civilians due to military combat and military 
sexual assault and trauma; 
(3) the rate of depression is 5 times higher in 
servicemembers than compared to civilians; 
(4) every day, 22 veterans die by suicide; 
(5) there is a fear of disclosing mental health condi-
tions and substance use disorders and seeking treatment 
due to negative career implications; and 
(6) less than 50 percent of veterans receive the men-
tal health treatment and services they need; 
Whereas 11 percent of those entering the Veterans Affairs 
health system meet the criteria for a substance use dis-
order; 
Whereas veterans are more likely to have an alcohol use dis-
order than civilians; 
Whereas 2 in 10 veterans with PTSD have a comorbid sub-
stance use disorder, and 1 in 3 veterans seeking services 
for a substance use disorder also have PTSD, showing 
the interconnectedness between these conditions; 
Whereas there is a need to better educate all those in the 
criminal justice system on the impact and needs of those 
with mental health conditions and substance use dis-
orders;

•HRES 1057 IH 
Whereas the United States justice system is the largest pro-
vider of mental health services, and it was not built, or 
intended to be used, for that purpose, and— 
(1) there are 550,000 people currently incarcerated 
with mental illness; 
(2) 1 in 5 people incarcerated has a serious mental 
illness; and 
(3) of those incarcerated, 75 percent with a serious 
mental illness suffer from a co-occurring substance use 
disorder; 
Whereas there is a need for incentives to reduce inappro-
priate incarceration and detention for those with mental 
health and substance use disorder needs; 
Whereas one-third of people incarcerated receive treatment 
for mental illness, and many times it is inconsistent and 
inadequate, and there is a need for improved access to 
services and treatments that are also trauma informed; 
Whereas there is a need to have mental health, substance use 
disorder, and diversion services available at all intercepts 
of the Sequential Intercept Model, a model developed to 
inform more appropriate community-based responses and 
divert those with mental illness and substance use dis-
order; 
Whereas there is a need to improve levels of coordination, 
care management, and insurance coverage before, during, 
and after incarceration; 
Whereas postrelease navigation is key to keeping people from 
reentering the justice system; 
Whereas there is insufficient understanding of the mental 
health effects of incarceration;

Whereas there is a need to redefine the juvenile justice sys-
tem to include those who are 25 years of age or younger 
in order to reflect the most up-to-date scientific con-
sensus on brain development and behavior; 
Whereas the juvenile justice system must fulfill its purpose 
of supporting, rehabilitating, and treating children in 
need rather than punishing them given that— 
(1) studies have shown that 70 percent of youth in 
detention have a diagnosed mental illness, and 60 percent 
of those may also meet the criteria for a substance use 
disorder; 
(2) 90 percent of those in the juvenile justice system 
have been exposed to trauma or violence which may in-
crease the likelihood of juvenile justice involvement; 
(3) entry into the juvenile justice system may exac-
erbate the existing mental health and substance use dis-
order concerns of youths, particularly in the absence of 
consistent screening and treatment for these conditions; 
and 
(4) an estimated 33 percent of children in long-term 
juvenile justice facilities have intellectual, developmental, 
and other disabilities and were receiving special education 
services; therefore there is a need to have specific services 
and programs within the juvenile justice system with a 
focus on their needs; 
Whereas studies show that 41.2 percent of those who are di-
agnosed with a substance use disorder are also diagnosed 
with a mental illness, which is likely an underestimate in 
light of the current barriers to identifying and reporting 
mental health concerns; 
Whereas given the high co-occurrence with mental illness, 
comprehensive care for substance use should include ac-
01:52 Jul 22, 2020

•HRES 1057 IH 
cess to psychopharmacology, psychotherapy, contingency 
management, recovery support, all evidence-based medi-
cation-assisted treatment, a multidisciplinary staff, and 
group therapy for adults, and— 
(1) addiction treatment centers should either offer 
or have available comprehensive care and support and 
have the ability to treat mental illness as well as sub-
stance use disorders; and 
(2) to allow for treatment flexibility to fit the needs 
of the patient, there is a need to increase access to all 
evidence-based medication-assisted treatment, in prisons, 
jails, and all addiction treatment centers; 
Whereas there are inequities in access, availability, and qual-
ity for mental health and substance use disorder services 
for minority communities, and— 
(1) there is greater stigma among racial and ethnic 
minority populations; 
(2) racial and ethnic minorities are disproportion-
ately affected by disabilities that result from mental 
health conditions; and 
(3) only 31 percent of African Americans and His-
panics and 22 percent of Asians receive mental health 
care compared to 48 percent of Caucasians; 
Whereas LGBTQ individuals are more than twice as likely to 
suffer from mental health conditions and substance use 
disorders than heterosexual individuals, and— 
(1) 29 percent of LGBTQ youths attempt suicide, 
which is almost 5 times more likely than heterosexual 
youths; 
(2) approximately 31 percent of LGBTQ older 
adults report symptoms of depression, and 39 percent re-
port seriously thinking about suicide;

(3) 30.8 percent of transgender individuals report 
considering suicide compared to 2.3 percent of hetero-
sexual individuals; and 
(4) of the 4,890 transgender individuals incarcerated 
in State prisons, only 15 were confirmed of being housed 
according to their lived gender, which poses a significant 
threat to their mental health; 
Whereas the COVID–19 pandemic has highlighted the gaps 
in our health system when it comes to mental health and 
substance use disorder services and shown how sheltering 
in place and isolating can impact one’s mental health and 
substance use, specifically showing— 
(1) that 47 percent of people report that the pan-
demic has negatively impacted their mental health, with 
21 percent saying that it has had a major negative im-
pact; 
(2) a significant increase in number of calls to sui-
cide prevention hotlines; 
(3) a 1,000-percent increase in texts to SAMHSA’s 
mental health hotline to about 20,000 texts in April 
2020; 
(4) a 55-percent increase in number of alcohol sales; 
and 
(5) an 11.4-percent increase in overdose fatalities in 
the first quarter of 2020 driven by increased feelings of 
anxiety, depression, and use of substances; and 
Whereas there is a need for a population health approach 
that examines the distribution of health across popu-
lations and focuses attention on the need to provide ac-
cess to the best evidence-based treatment for those with 
mental health conditions and substance use disorders who 
need clinical intervention in order to effectively reduce or
