Whereas in addition to the immediate physical and emotional 
costs of sexual assault, sexual assault has numerous ad-
verse consequences, which can include post-traumatic 
stress disorder, substance abuse, major depression, home-
lessness, eating disorders, and suicide, according to the 
National Alliance to End Sexual Violence; 
Whereas many sexual assaults are not reported to law en-
forcement agencies, and many States have restrictive 
criminal statutes of limitations, which enable many rap-
ists to evade punishment for their crimes; 
Whereas approximately 70 percent of sexual crimes are com-
mitted by individuals who are known to the victim; 
Whereas sexual assault survivors suffer emotional scars long 
after the physical scars have healed;

identified and prosecuted in many rape cases; 
Whereas prosecution can lead to the incarceration of rapists 
and prevent those individuals from committing additional 
crimes; 
Whereas national, State, territorial, and Tribal coalitions, 
community-based rape crisis centers, and other organiza-
tions across the United States are committed to— 
(1) serving survivors of sexual violence;

and education; and 
(3) increasing public awareness of sexual violence 
and the prevalence of sexual violence; 
Whereas according to the National Alliance to End Sexual

sionals, public health workers, educators, first respond-
ers, and victim service providers;

Whereas free, confidential help is available to all victims and 
survivors of sexual assault through—
