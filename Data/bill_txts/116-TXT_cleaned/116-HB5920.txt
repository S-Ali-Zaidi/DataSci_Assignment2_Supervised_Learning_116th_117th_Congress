SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
5
Congress finds that— 
6
(1) the population of western monarch butter-
7
flies is at imminent risk of extinction; 
8
(2) over the past 3 decades, the population of 
9
western monarch butterflies has declined by more 
10
than 99 percent due to prolonged drought, loss of 
11
milkweed and native pollinator habitat, loss of breed-
12
ing and overwintering habitat, and climate change; 
13
(3) in 2019, the population of western monarch 
14
butterflies maintained a historic low of approxi-
15
mately 29,000 butterflies, falling below the predicted 
16
extinction threshold; 
17
(4) the extinction of the population of migra-
18
tory western monarch butterflies is now likely to 
19
occur within the next 2 decades if urgent action is 
20
not taken; 
21
(5) actively restoring native milkweed and nec-
22
tar plants, monarch overwintering habitat, and other 
23
pollinator habitat, and ensuring that key habitats 
24
are protected from destruction, are critical to ensur-
25
ing the survival of western monarch butterflies and

can also help facilitate conservation of other essen-
1
tial pollinators; and 
2
(6) enhancing pollinator populations can result 
3
in improved pollination services for neighboring land, 
4
including agriculture and wildlife ecosystems.
