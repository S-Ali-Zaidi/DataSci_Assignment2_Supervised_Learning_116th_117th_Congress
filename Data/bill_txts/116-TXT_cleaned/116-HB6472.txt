of confirmed cases of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID– 
1
19), including any renewal thereof, it shall be unlawful 
2
for any person to sell or offer for sale a good or service 
3
at a price that— 
4
(1) is unconscionably excessive; and 
5
(2) indicates the seller is using the circumstan-
6
ces related to such public health emergency to in-
7
crease prices unreasonably.

(b) FACTORS FOR CONSIDERATION.—In determining 
9
whether a person has violated subsection (a), there shall 
10
be taken into account, with respect to the price at which 
11
such person sold or offered for sale the good or service, 
12
factors that include the following: 
13
(1) Whether such price grossly exceeds the av-
14
erage price at which the same or a similar good or 
15
service was sold or offered for sale by such person— 
16
(A) during the 90-day period immediately 
17
preceding January 31, 2020; or 
18
(B) during the same 90-day period of the 
19
previous year. 
20
(2) Whether such price grossly exceeds the av-
21
erage price at which the same or a similar good or 
22
service was readily obtainable from other similarly 
23
situated competing sellers before January 31, 2020.

(3) Whether such price reasonably reflects addi-
1
tional costs, not within the control of such person, 
2
that were paid, incurred, or reasonably anticipated 
3
by such person, or reasonably reflects the profit-
4
ability of forgone sales or additional risks taken by 
5
such person, to produce, distribute, obtain, or sell 
6
such good or service under the circumstances.
