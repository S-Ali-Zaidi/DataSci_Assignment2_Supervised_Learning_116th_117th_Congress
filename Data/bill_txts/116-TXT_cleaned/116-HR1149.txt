RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the need for diapers and expressing support 
for donating generously to diaper banks, diaper drives, 
and organizations that distribute diapers to families in 
need. 
Whereas diaper need, the condition of not having a sufficient 
supply of clean diapers to keep babies and toddlers clean, 
dry, and healthy, can adversely affect the health and 
well-being of babies, toddlers, and their families; 
Whereas national surveys and research studies report that 1 
in 3 families struggles with diaper need, and 48 percent 
of families delay changing a diaper to extend their sup-
ply;

Whereas children go through 6 to 12 diapers each day during 
the 2 to 3 years they wear diapers; 
Whereas purchasing enough diapers to keep a baby or toddler 
clean, dry, and healthy can consume 14 percent of a low- 
wage family’s post-tax income, making it difficult to ob-
tain a sufficient supply; 
Whereas a daily or weekly supply of diapers is generally an 
eligibility requirement for babies and toddlers to partici-
pate in childcare programs and high-quality early edu-
cation programs; 
Whereas, without enough diapers, babies and toddlers risk in-
fections and health problems that may require medical 
attention, and may prevent parents from attending work 
or school, thereby hurting the family’s economic pros-
pects and well-being; 
Whereas addressing diaper need can lead to economic oppor-
tunity for families and communities and improved health 
for children, thus ensuring all children and families have 
access to the basic necessities required to thrive and 
reach their full potential; 
Whereas the numerous committed staff and volunteers at dia-
per banks across the country work tirelessly in their com-
munities, distributing millions of diapers and serving 
hundreds of thousands of children each month; 
Whereas these diaper banks and their staff and volunteers 
serve on the front lines of the United States of America’s 
COVID–19 pandemic response by helping families in our 
communities weather the crisis; and 
Whereas, while experiencing double, triple, or greater increase 
in demand for diapers due to the pandemic and economic 
shutdown, these diaper banks are doing everything in
