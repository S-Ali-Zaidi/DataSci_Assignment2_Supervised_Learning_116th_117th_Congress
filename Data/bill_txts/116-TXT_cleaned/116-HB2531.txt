SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘National Strategic and 
2
Critical Minerals Production Act’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds that— 
5
(1) the industrialization of developing nations 
6
has driven demand for nonfuel minerals necessary 
7
for 
telecommunications, 
military 
technologies, 
8
healthcare technologies, and conventional and renew-
9
able energy technologies; 
10
(2) the availability of minerals and mineral ma-
11
terials are essential for economic growth, national 
12
security, technological innovation, and the manufac-
13
turing and agricultural supply chain; 
14
(3) minerals and mineral materials are critical 
15
components of every transportation, water, tele-
16
communications, and energy infrastructure project 
17
necessary to modernize the crumbling infrastructure 
18
of the United States; 
19
(4) the exploration, production, processing, use, 
20
and recycling of minerals contribute significantly to 
21
the economic well-being, security, and general wel-
22
fare of the United States; and 
23
(5) the United States has vast mineral re-
24
sources but is becoming increasingly dependent on 
25
00:32 May 14, 2019
H2531

•HR 2531 IH
foreign sources of mineral resources, as dem-
1
onstrated by the fact that— 
2
(A) 25 years ago, the United States was 
3
dependent on foreign sources for 45 nonfuel 
4
mineral materials, of which— 
5
(i) 8 were imported by the United 
6
States to fulfill 100 percent of the require-
7
ments of the United States for those 
8
nonfuel mineral materials; and 
9
(ii) 19 were imported by the United 
10
States to fulfill greater than 50 percent of 
11
the requirements of the United States for 
12
those nonfuel mineral materials; 
13
(B) by 2015 the import dependence of the 
14
United States for nonfuel mineral materials in-
15
creased from dependence on the import of 45 
16
nonfuel mineral materials to dependence on the 
17
import of 47 nonfuel mineral materials, of 
18
which— 
19
(i) 19 were imported by the United 
20
States to fulfill 100 percent of the require-
21
ments of the United States for those 
22
nonfuel mineral materials; and 
23
(ii) 22 were imported by the United 
24
States to fulfill greater than 50 percent of

•HR 2531 IH
the requirements of the United States for 
1
those nonfuel mineral materials; 
2
(C) according to the Department of En-
3
ergy, the United States imports greater than 50 
4
percent of the 41 metals and minerals key to 
5
clean energy applications; 
6
(D) the United States share of worldwide 
7
mineral exploration dollars was 7 percent in 
8
2015, down from 19 percent in the early 1990s; 
9
(E) the 2014 Ranking of Countries for 
10
Mining Investment, which ranks 25 major min-
11
ing countries, found that 7- to 10-year permit-
12
ting delays are the most significant risk to min-
13
ing projects in the United States; and 
14
(F) in late 2016, the Government Account-
15
ability Office found that— 
16
(i) ‘‘the Federal government’s ap-
17
proach to addressing critical materials sup-
18
ply issues has not been consistent with se-
19
lected key practices for interagency col-
20
laboration, such as ensuring that agencies’ 
21
roles and responsibilities are clearly de-
22
fined’’; and 
23
(ii) ‘‘the Federal critical materials ap-
24
proach faces other limitations, including
