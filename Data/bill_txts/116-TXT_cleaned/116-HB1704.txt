(1) According to the 2017 National Security 
1
Strategy of the United States of America, ‘‘Retain-
2
ing our position as the world’s preeminent economic 
3
actor strengthens our ability to use the tools of eco-
4
nomic diplomacy for the good of Americans and oth-
5
ers.’’.

(2) A November 7, 2018, cable from Secretary 
7
of State Michael R. Pompeo to all diplomatic and 
8
consular posts—‘‘Boosting Commercial Diplomacy 
9
Around the World’’—stated that ‘‘helping American 
10
companies is a foreign policy priority . . . Pro-
11
moting broad-based, responsible, and sustainable 
12
economic growth helps to stabilize regions and cre-
13
ates new and growing markets for U.S. companies. 
14
A transparent and level playing field for U.S. invest-
15
ment in these countries counters real and growing 
16
challenges such as China’s Belt and Road initia-
17
tive.’’.
