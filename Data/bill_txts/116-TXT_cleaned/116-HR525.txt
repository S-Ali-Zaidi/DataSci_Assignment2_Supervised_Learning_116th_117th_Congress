RESOLUTION 
Calling for the designation of Antifa as a domestic terrorist 
organization. 
Whereas members of Antifa, because they believe that free 
speech is equivalent to violence, have used threats of vio-
lence in the pursuit of suppressing opposing political 
ideologies; 
Whereas Antifa represents opposition to the democratic ideals 
of peaceful assembly and free speech for all; 
Whereas members of Antifa have physically assaulted jour-
nalists and other individuals during protests and riots in 
Berkeley, California; 
Whereas in February of 2018, journalist Andy Ngo was in-
timidated and threatened with violence by protestors af-
filiated with Antifa;

Whereas, on June 29, 2019, while covering demonstrations in 
Portland, Oregon, journalist Andy Ngo was physically at-
tacked by protestors affiliated with Antifa; 
Whereas employees of the U.S. Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement (referred to in this preamble as ‘‘ICE’’) 
were subjected to doxxing and violent threats after their 
social media profiles, phone numbers, and home address-
es were posted on the internet by left wing activists; 
Whereas according to the Wall Street Journal, an ICE officer 
was followed by left wing activists and ‘‘confronted when 
he went to pick up his daughter from summer camp’’, 
and another ‘‘had his name and photo plastered on flyers 
outside his home accusing him of being part of the ‘Ge-
stapo’ ’’; 
Whereas the ICE office in southwest Portland, Oregon, was 
shut down for days due to threats and occupation by 
Antifa members; 
Whereas Rose City Antifa, an Antifa group founded in 2007 
in Portland, Oregon, explicitly rejects the authority of 
law enforcement officers in the United States, and Fed-
eral, State, and local governments, to protect free speech 
and stop acts of violence; 
Whereas Rose City Antifa rejects the civil treatment of indi-
viduals the group labels as fascists, stating: ‘‘We can’t 
just argue against them; we have to prevent them from 
organizing by any means necessary.’’; and 
Whereas there is no place for violence in the discourse be-
tween people in the United States, or in any civil society, 
because the United States is a place where there is a di-
versity of ideas and opinions: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
