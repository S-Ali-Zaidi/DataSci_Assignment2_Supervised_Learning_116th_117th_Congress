•HR 2561 IH
(1) On May 1, 2014, the Sultan of Brunei an-
1
nounced that a revised penal code would take effect 
2
in three phases. 
3
(2) The penal code mandates the death penalty 
4
for numerous offenses, among them adultery, con-
5
sensual same-sex relations, blasphemy, and robbery. 
6
(3) The penal code also mandates flogging for 
7
women who have abortions, and amputation for 
8
theft. 
9
(4) The penal code further criminalizes expos-
10
ing Muslim children to the beliefs and practices of 
11
any religion other than Islam. 
12
(5) The revised penal code represents an as-
13
sault on the rights of the LGBTI community, 
14
women, children, and religious minorities, as well as 
15
on the people of Brunei as a whole. 
16
(6) According to the United Nations High Com-
17
missioner for Human Rights, the penal code intro-
18
duced stoning to death as the specific method of exe-
19
cution for adultery, consensual same-sex relations, 
20
and extramarital sexual relations. 
21
(7) On April 11, 2014, the spokesperson for the 
22
United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
23
Rights said that ‘‘Under international law, stoning 
24
people to death constitutes torture or other cruel, in-
25

human or degrading treatment or punishment and is 
1
thus clearly prohibited.’’ and noted that— 
2
(A) ‘‘A number of UN studies have also re-
3
vealed that women are more likely to be sen-
4
tenced to death by stoning, due to deeply en-
5
trenched 
discrimination 
and 
stereotyping 
6
against them, including among law enforcement 
7
and judicial officers.’’; and 
8
(B) ‘‘The criminalization and application 
9
of the death penalty for consensual relations be-
10
tween adults in private also violates a whole 
11
host of rights, including the rights to privacy, 
12
to equality before the law, the right to health 
13
and freedom from arbitrary arrest and deten-
14
tion. The provisions of the revised penal code 
15
may encourage further violence and discrimina-
16
tion against women and also against people on 
17
the basis of sexual orientation.’’. 
18
(8) The first phase of the new penal code went 
19
into effect in 2014, but the final two phases were 
20
not enacted between 2014 and 2019 as a result of 
21
pressure from international and domestic human 
22
rights organizations. 
23
(9) In December 2018, the Government of 
24
Brunei confirmed that the final rollout of the second 
25

•HR 2561 IH
and third phases of the penal code, including the 
1
provisions of capital punishment by stoning, would 
2
be fully implemented beginning April 3, 2019. 
3
(10) On April 1, 2019, a statement from the 
4
United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
5
Rights noted that the revised penal code ‘‘would en-
6
shrine in legislation cruel and inhuman punishments 
7
that seriously breach international human rights 
8
law’’ and stated that ‘‘Human rights and faith are 
9
not opposing forces – indeed, it is human interpreta-
10
tion that creates tensions. It is vital that the Gov-
11
ernment, religious authorities and a wide range of 
12
civil society actors work jointly to uphold human 
13
dignity and equality for all.’’. 
14
(11) Several other countries have provisions in 
15
their penal code similar to those described in this 
16
section with respect to Brunei, which also represent 
17
instances of grave abuses of human rights when en-
18
forced. 
19
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
20
It is the sense of Congress that— 
21
(1) the implementation of Brunei’s draconian 
22
new penal code should be condemned in the strong-
23
est possible terms; 
24

•HR 2561 IH
(2) the United States should reaffirm its com-
1
mitment to the full enjoyment of human rights by all 
2
people; 
3
(3) particular protections are needed for vulner-
4
able populations throughout the world, including the 
5
LGBTI community, women, children, and religious 
6
minorities; 
7
(4) the revised penal code in Brunei represents 
8
an assault on the rights of those vulnerable popu-
9
lations, as well as on the people of Brunei as a 
10
whole; 
11
(5) the President and Secretary of State should 
12
condemn in clear terms the grave breach of human 
13
rights represented by the new penal code; 
14
(6) the Government of Brunei should consider 
15
the potential negative impact of these new provisions 
16
on tourism from, and business with, countries that 
17
respect human rights; and 
18
(7) sanctions should be imposed on any official 
19
of any other country who implements or enforces 
20
provisions similar to those found in the revised penal 
21
code of Brunei.
