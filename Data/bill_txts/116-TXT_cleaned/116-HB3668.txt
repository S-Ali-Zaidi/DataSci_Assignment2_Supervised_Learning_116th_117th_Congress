A BILL 
To direct the Occupational Safety and Health Administration 
to issue an occupational safety and health standard to 
protect workers from heat-related injuries and illnesses. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE AND FINDINGS. 
3
(a) SHORT TITLE.—This Act may be cited as the 
4
‘‘Asuncion Valdivia Heat Illness and Fatality Prevention 
5
Act of 2019’’. 
6
(b) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:

•HR 3668 IH
(1) Excessive heat exposure poses a direct 
1
threat to workers and the economy. Climate change 
2
increases this danger, as 18 of the 19 hottest years 
3
on record have occurred since 2001. Rising tempera-
4
tures are projected to cause an increase in heat-re-
5
lated workplace injuries and illnesses, a dramatic 
6
loss in labor capacity, and decreased productivity. 
7
(2) Heat-related illnesses can arise when high 
8
temperatures rise above the body’s capacity to dispel 
9
heat. Impacts range from comparatively minor prob-
10
lems such as heat cramps to severe afflictions such 
11
as organ damage, heat exhaustion, stroke, and 
12
death. 
13
(3) Farmworkers and construction workers suf-
14
fer the highest incidence of heat illness, but all out-
15
door and indoor workers employed in excessively hot 
16
and humid environments are at significant risk of 
17
material impairment of health or functional capacity. 
18
(4) Asuncion Valdivia was a California farm-
19
worker who died of heat stroke in 2004 after picking 
20
grapes for 10 straight hours in 105 degree tempera-
21
tures. Instead of calling an ambulance, his employer 
22
told his son to drive Mr. Valdivia home. On his way 
23
home, he started foaming at the mouth and died.

•HR 3668 IH
(5) People working in excessive heat suffer di-
1
minished mental acuity and physical ability, which 
2
increases the risk of accidents. Heat-related injuries 
3
and illnesses increase workers’ compensation costs 
4
and medical expenses. 
5
(6) The costs of lower labor productivity under 
6
rising temperatures is estimated to reach up to 
7
$160,000,000,000 in lost wages per year in the 
8
United States by 2090 according to the 2018 Na-
9
tional Climate Assessment. The drop in productivity 
10
decreases income for employers and workers. Global 
11
gross domestic product losses from heat are pro-
12
jected to be greater than 20 percent by the end of 
13
this century. 
14
(7) Every year, thousands of workers become 
15
sick and some die from exposure to heat. Between 
16
1992 and 2017, 815 United States workers died 
17
from heat and almost 70,000 were seriously injured. 
18
These numbers are generally understood to be gross 
19
undercounts because many heat-related illnesses and 
20
deaths are blamed on natural causes. 
21
(8) Workers have a legal right to a safe work-
22
place. The vast majority of heat-related workplace 
23
deaths and illnesses can be prevented by access to 
24
water, rest, and shade. Many employers don’t pro-
25

•HR 3668 IH
vide these simple measures for workers according to 
1
the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. 
2
(9) Employers often retaliate against employees 
3
if they report or seek assistance due to problems 
4
with heat. Many employees are therefore afraid to 
5
report problems and face increased risk of heat-re-
6
lated illnesses or death. 
7
(10) In the absence of a Federal standard, mul-
8
tiple branches of the United States Armed Forces— 
9
including the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air 
10
Force—have issued heat prevention guidelines, and 
11
several States—California, Washington, and Min-
12
nesota—have issued heat prevention standards. The 
13
National Institute for Occupational Safety and 
14
Health (NIOSH) issued criteria for such a standard 
15
in 1972, updating it in 1986 and 2016. 
16
(11) Congress created the Occupational Safety 
17
and Health Administration to ensure safe and 
18
healthful working conditions by setting and enforc-
19
ing standards pursuant to section 6 of the Occupa-
20
tional Safety and Health Act of 1970. Employees 
21
are exposed to grave danger from exposure to exces-
22
sive heat. The Occupational Safety and Health Ad-
23
ministration must develop a standard to protect
