8

9
grants and cooperative agreements by creating and 
10

grants and cooperative agreement recipients must 
1
report to the Federal Government; 
2
(2) implement the recommendation by the Di-
3
rector of the Office of Management and Budget, 
4
under section 5(b)(6) of the Federal Funding Ac-
5
countability and Transparency Act of 2006 (31 
6
U.S.C. 6101 note), which includes the development 
7
of a ‘‘comprehensive taxonomy of standard defini-
8
tions for core data elements required for managing 
9
Federal financial assistance awards’’; 
10
(3) reduce burden and compliance costs of re-
11
cipients of Federal grants and cooperative agree-
12
ments by enabling technology solutions, existing or 
13
yet to be developed, by both the public and private 
14
sectors, to better manage data recipients already 
15
provide to the Federal Government; and 
16
(4) to strengthen oversight and management of 
17
Federal grants and cooperative agreements by agen-
18
cies through consolidated collection and display of 
19
and access to open data that has been standardized, 
20
and where appropriate, transparency to the public.
