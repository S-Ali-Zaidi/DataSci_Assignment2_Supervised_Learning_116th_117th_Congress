a claim based on sex under title VII of the Civil

‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—An issue as to whether this

determined under Federal law. The applicability of 
3
this chapter to an agreement to arbitrate and the 
4
validity and enforceability of an agreement to which

this chapter applies shall be determined by a court,

agreement specifically or in conjunction with other

terms of the contract containing such agreement.

‘‘(2) COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS.— 
11
Nothing in this chapter shall apply to any arbitra-
12
tion provision in a contract between an employer and 
13
a labor organization or between labor organizations, 
14
except that no such arbitration provision shall have 
15
the effect of waiving the right of an employee to 
16
seek judicial enforcement of a right arising under a 
17
provision of the Constitution of the United States, a 
18
State constitution, or a Federal or State statute, or 
19
public policy arising therefrom.’’.
