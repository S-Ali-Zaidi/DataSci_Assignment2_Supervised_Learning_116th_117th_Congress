RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Uprising. 
Whereas the Stonewall Inn opened on or around March 18, 
1967, at 51–53 Christopher Street in Greenwich Village, 
New York City, New York; 
Whereas Greenwich Village and establishments like the 
Stonewall Inn served as a sanctuary for members of the 
lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) 
community from persecution by police and society at 
large; 
Whereas, at that time, many State and local governments, in-
cluding New York City, criminalized how LGBTQ people 
expressed their identities and their relationships;

Whereas, at that time, LGBTQ people were frequently har-
assed by law enforcement, including the New York City 
Police Department; 
Whereas LGBTQ people had begun to stand up to such po-
lice harassment, including at Cooper Do-nuts in Los An-
geles in 1959, Compton’s Cafeteria in San Francisco in 
1966, and Black Cat Tavern in Los Angeles in 1967; 
Whereas, in the early morning hours of June 28, 1969, the 
New York City Police Department raided the Stonewall 
Inn and arrested many patrons of the Inn, but brave in-
dividuals, particularly transgender women of color, stood 
up to injustice that night; 
Whereas these strong voices sparked an uprising against the 
police, with confrontations and protests at the Stonewall 
Inn and the surrounding area lasting until July 3, 1969; 
Whereas the Stonewall Uprising empowered thousands of 
LGBTQ people to emerge from the shadows and come 
out publicly as they stood up for their community that 
night, putting their lives and safety at risk; 
Whereas, along with public protests in Chicago, Los Angeles, 
New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco, the District of 
Columbia, and elsewhere, the Stonewall Uprising became 
a catalyst for the LGBTQ civil rights movement to se-
cure social and political equality and inspired the forma-
tion of many advocacy organizations; 
Whereas, on June 27 and 28, 1970, members of the LGBTQ 
community commemorated the first anniversary of Stone-
wall and reaffirmed the solidarity of the LGBTQ commu-
nity by organizing the first Pride marches or gatherings 
in New York City, San Francisco, Chicago, and Los An-
geles;

Whereas the Stonewall Uprising is remembered and cele-
brated every year in June during ‘‘LGBTQ Pride 
Month’’; 
Whereas, in June 2016, the Stonewall Inn and its sur-
rounding area was declared a National Monument, be-
coming the first national monument to commemorate the 
LGBTQ civil rights movement; 
Whereas, in June 2019, World Pride will be held for the first 
time in the United States in New York City to com-
memorate the Stonewall Uprising, bringing representa-
tives of the global LGBTQ community together to recog-
nize these historic events; 
Whereas, on May 30, 2019, the government of New York 
City announced that it would dedicate a monument hon-
oring pioneering transgender activists and key leaders in 
the Stonewall Uprising, Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia 
Rivera, the first permanent, public monument in the 
world honoring transgender women; 
Whereas, on June 6, 2019, the New York City Police Com-
missioner issued an official apology on behalf of the New 
York City Police Department, stating, ‘‘The actions 
taken by the NYPD were wrong—plain and simple.’’; 
Whereas, despite the progress made since the Stonewall Up-
rising, members of the LGBTQ community continue to 
experience biased policing and are still at significant risk 
of violence and discrimination; 
Whereas according to the annual hate crimes report of the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation, LGBTQ people, particu-
larly LGBTQ people of color, continue to be the target 
of bias-motivated violence, and efforts to address this vio-

lence may be hindered by a continued lack of trust in law 
enforcement; 
Whereas at least 100 transgender individuals, primarily 
women of color, have been murdered in the United States 
since the beginning of 2015; and 
Whereas no American should have to fear being the target of 
violence because of who they are or who they love: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—

(1) recognizes the 50th anniversary of the
