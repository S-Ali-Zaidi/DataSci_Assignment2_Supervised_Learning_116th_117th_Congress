(1) mandatory civil authority shutdowns as a 
1
result of the coronarvirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
2
have adversely impacted businesses throughout the 
3
United States; 
4
(2) the American economy relies in part upon 
5
an investment in and expectation of insurance bene-
6
fits that back business assets and the workforce; 
7
(3) many businesses have paid policy premiums 
8
for business interruption coverage and, in particular, 
9
for coverage for civil authority shutdowns of busi-
10
nesses; 
11
(4) many businesses that purchased business 
12
interruption coverage and coverage for civil author-
13
ity shutdowns did so in the expectation that insur-
14
ance would protect a temporary shutdown of their 
15
workforce, prevent layoffs and furloughs, and allow 
16
an orderly restart of operations; and 
17
(5) State laws mandate an orderly and prompt 
18
payment of first party insurance claims and insurers 
19
have claim management resources with the expertise 
20
and skills to timely manage claims payment and dis-
21
tribution of funds according to expected and relied 
22
upon guidelines and procedures that policyholders 
23
had the expectation to receive.

(1) to establish a program to encourage and

provide support for insurers who timely pay claims

ensures that—

not receive any Federal windfall; and 
10
(B) carriers that sold policies that ex-
11
pressly exclude coverage for a virus or pan-
12
demic for COVID-19 can avoid costly litigation 
13
with policyholders, and policyholders may re-
14
ceive policy benefits to compensate for govern-
15
ment shutdown and business interruption.
