1
CONSERVATION STANDARD. 
2
(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 325(ff)(6) of the Energy 
3
Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6295(ff)(6)) is 
4
amended by adding at the end the following: 
5
‘‘(C)(i) Large-diameter ceiling fans manufactured on 
6
or after January 21, 2020, shall— 
7
‘‘(I) not be required to meet minimum ceiling 
8
fan efficiency in terms of ratio of the total airflow 
9
to the total power consumption as described in the 
10
final rule titled ‘Energy Conservation Program: En-
11
ergy Conservation Standards for Ceiling Fans’ (82 
12
Fed. Reg. 6826 (January 19, 2017)); and 
13
‘‘(II) have a CFEI greater than or equal to— 
14
‘‘(aa) 1.00 at high speed; and 
15
‘‘(bb) 1.31 at 40 percent speed or the 
16
nearest speed that is not less than 40 percent 
17
speed. 
18
‘‘(ii) For purposes of this subparagraph, the term 
19
‘CFEI’ means the Fan Energy Index for large-diameter 
20
ceiling fans, calculated in accordance with ANSI/AMCA 
21
Standard 208–18 titled ‘Calculation of the Fan Energy 
22
Index’, with the following modifications: 
23
‘‘(I) Using an Airflow Constant (Q0) of 26,500 
24
cubic feet per minute.

(b) REVISION.—For purposes of section 325(m) of 
5
the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C.
