propriate force against those nations, organizations, 
1
or persons he determines planned, authorized, com-

on September 11, 2001, or harbored such organiza-
4
tions or persons’’.

(2) Iran and Al Qaeda historically have been 
6
adversaries. A 2018 analysis of declassified docu-
7
ments obtained during the 2011 raid on Osama bin

9
Iran as a hostile entity’’ and ‘‘examined documents 
10
provide no evidence of cooperation between [Al 
11
Qaeda] and Iran on planning or carrying out ter-
12
rorist attacks’’.

(3) The Authorization for Use of Military Force 
14
Against Iraq Resolution of 2002 (Public Law 107– 
15

16
‘‘to use the Armed Forces of the United States as 
17

19
United States against the continuing threat posed by 
20
Iraq; and (2) enforce all relevant United Nations Se-
21
curity Council resolutions regarding Iraq’’.

23
Ambassador John Bolton announced the deployment

be met with unrelenting force’’.
