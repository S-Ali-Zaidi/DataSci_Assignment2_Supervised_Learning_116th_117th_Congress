SEC. 701. FINDINGS. 
14
Congress finds the following: 
15
(1) Over 1 in 3 women experience sexual vio-
16
lence, and 1 in 5 women have survived completed or 
17
attempted rape. Such violence has a devastating im-
18
pact on women’s physical and emotional health, fi-
19
nancial security, and ability to maintain their jobs, 
20
and thus impacts interstate commerce and economic 
21
security. 
22
(2) The Office on Violence Against Women of 
23
the Department of Justice defines domestic violence 
24
as a pattern of abusive behavior in any relationship 
25
00:35 Mar 20, 2019

•HR 1585 IH
that is used by one intimate partner to gain or 
1
maintain power and control over another intimate 
2
partner. Domestic violence can include physical, sex-
3
ual, emotional, economic, or psychological actions or 
4
threats of actions that influence another person. Do-
5
mestic violence includes any behaviors that intimi-
6
date, manipulate, humiliate, isolate, frighten, ter-
7
rorize, coerce, threaten, blame, hurt, injure, or 
8
wound an individual.

12
millions of individuals in the United States. Nearly 
13
1 in 4 women and 1 in 9 men in the United States 
14
have suffered sexual violence, physical violence, or 
15
stalking by an intimate partner. 
16
(4) Homicide is one of the leading causes of 
17
death for women on the job. Domestic partners or 
18
relatives commit 43 percent of workplace homicides 
19
against women. One study found that intimate part-
20
ner violence resulted in 142 homicides among women 
21
at work in the United States from 2003 to 2008, a 
22
figure which represents 22 percent of the 648 work-
23
place homicides among women during the period. In 
24
fact, in 2010, homicides against women at work in-
25

creased by 13 percent despite continuous declines in 
1
overall workplace homicides in recent years. 
2
(5) Women in the United States are 11 times 
3
more likely to be murdered with guns than women 
4
in other high-income countries. Female intimate 
5
partners are more likely to be murdered with a fire-
6
arm than all other means combined. The presence of 
7
a gun in domestic violence situations increases the 
8
risk of homicide for women by 500 percent. 
9
(6) Violence can have a dramatic impact on the 
10
survivor of such violence. Studies indicate that 44 
11
percent of surveyed employed adults experienced the 
12
effect of domestic violence in the workplace, and 64 
13
percent indicated their workplace performance was 
14
affected by such violence. Another recent survey 
15
found that 78 percent of offenders used workplace 
16
resources to express anger, check up on, pressure, or 
17
threaten a survivor. Sexual assault, whether occur-
18
ring in or out of the workplace, can impair an em-
19
ployee’s work performance, require time away from 
20
work, and undermine the employee’s ability to main-
21
tain a job. Nearly 50 percent of sexual assault sur-
22
vivors lose their jobs or are forced to quit in the 
23
aftermath of the assaults. 
24

(7) Studies find that 60 percent of single 
1
women lack economic security and 81 percent of 
2
households with single mothers live in economic inse-
3
curity. Significant barriers that survivors confront 
4
include access to housing, transportation, and child 
5
care. Ninety-two percent of homeless women have 
6
experienced domestic violence, and more than 50 
7
percent of such women cite domestic violence as the 
8
direct cause for homelessness. Survivors are deprived 
9
of their autonomy, liberty, and security, and face 
10
tremendous threats to their health and safety. 
11
(8) The Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
12
vention report that survivors of severe intimate part-
13
ner violence lose nearly 8,000,000 days of paid work, 
14
which is the equivalent of more than 32,000 full- 
15
time jobs and almost 5,600,000 days of household 
16
productivity each year. Therefore, women dispropor-
17
tionately need time off to care for their health or to 
18
find safety solutions, such as obtaining a restraining 
19
order or finding housing, to avoid or prevent further 
20
violence. 
21
(9) Annual costs of intimate partner violence 
22
are estimated to be more than $8,300,000,000. Ac-
23
cording to the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
24
vention, the costs of intimate partner violence 
25
00:35 Mar 20, 2019
H1585
90 
•HR 1585 IH
against women in 1995 exceeded an estimated 
1
$5,800,000,000. 
These 
costs 
included 
nearly 
2
$4,100,000,000 in the direct costs of medical and 
3
mental health care and nearly $1,800,000,000 in the 
4
indirect costs of lost productivity. These statistics 
5
are generally considered to be underestimated be-
6
cause the costs associated with the criminal justice 
7
system are not included. 
8
(10) Fifty-five percent of senior executives re-
9
cently surveyed said domestic violence has a harmful 
10
effect on their company’s productivity, and more 
11
than 70 percent said domestic violence negatively af-
12
fects attendance. Seventy-eight percent of human re-
13
sources professionals consider partner violence a 
14
workplace issue. However, more than 70 percent of 
15
United States workplaces have no formal program or 
16
policy that addresses workplace violence, let alone 
17
domestic violence. In fact, only four percent of em-
18
ployers provided training on domestic violence. 
19
(11) Studies indicate that one of the best pre-
20
dictors of whether a survivor will be able to stay 
21
away from his or her abuser is the degree of his or 
22
her economic independence. However, domestic vio-
23
lence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking

often negatively impact a survivor’s ability to main-
1
tain employment. 
2
(12) Abusers frequently seek to exert financial 
3
control over their partners by actively interfering 
4
with their ability to work, including preventing their 
5
partners from going to work, harassing their part-
6
ners at work, limiting their partners’ access to cash 
7
or transportation, and sabotaging their partners’ 
8
child care arrangements. 
9
(13) Economic abuse refers to behaviors that 
10
control an intimate partner’s ability to acquire, use, 
11
and maintain access to, money, credit, ownership of 
12
assets, or access to governmental or private financial 
13
benefits, including defaulting on joint obligations 
14
(such as school loans, credit card debt, mortgages, 
15
or rent). Other forms of such abuse may include pre-
16
venting someone from attending school, threatening 
17
to or actually terminating employment, controlling 
18
or withholding access to cash, checking, or credit ac-
19
counts, and attempting to damage or sabotage the 
20
creditworthiness of an intimate partner, including 
21
forcing an intimate partner to write bad checks, 
22
forcing an intimate partner to default on payments 
23
related to household needs, such as housing, or forc-
24
ing an intimate partner into bankruptcy.

SEC. 901. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. 
22
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
23
(1) American Indians and Alaska Natives are 
24
2.5 times as likely to experience violent crimes—and 
25
00:35 Mar 20, 2019
H1585
125 
•HR 1585 IH
at least 2 times more likely to experience rape or 
1
sexual assault crimes—compared to all other races. 
2
(2) More than 4 in 5 American Indian and 
3
Alaska Native women, or 84.3 percent, have experi-
4
enced violence in their lifetime. 
5
(3) The vast majority of Native victims—96% 
6
of women and 89% of male victims—report being 
7
victimized by a non-Indian. 
8
(4) Native victims of sexual violence are three 
9
times as likely to have experienced sexual violence by 
10
an interracial perpetrator as non-Hispanic White 
11
victims and Native stalking victims are nearly 4 
12
times as likely to be stalked by someone of a dif-
13
ferent race. 
14
(5) While tribes exercising jurisdiction over 
15
non-Indians have reported significant successes, the 
16
inability to prosecute crimes related to the Special 
17
Domestic Violence Criminal Jurisdiction crimes con-
18
tinues to leave Tribes unable to fully hold domestic 
19
violence offenders accountable. 
20
(6) Tribal prosecutors report that the majority 
21
of domestic violence cases involve children either as 
22
witnesses or victims, and Department of Justice re-
23
ports that American Indian and Alaska Native chil-
24
00:35 Mar 20, 2019
H1585
126 
•HR 1585 IH
dren suffer exposure to violence at rates higher than 
1
any other race in the United States. 
2
(7) Childhood exposure to violence has imme-
3
diate and long-term effects, including: increased 
4
rates of altered neurological development, poor phys-
5
ical and mental health, poor school performance, 
6
substance abuse, and overrepresentation in the juve-
7
nile justice system. 
8
(8) According to the Centers for Disease Con-
9
trol and Prevention, homicide is the third leading 
10
cause of death among American Indian and Alaska 
11
Native women between 10 and 24 years of age and 
12
the fifth leading cause of death for American Indian 
13
and Alaska Native women between 25 and 34 years 
14
of age. 
15
(9) On some reservations, Indian women are 
16
murdered at more than 10 times the national aver-
17
age. 
18
(10) According to a 2010 Government Account-
19
ability Office report, United States Attorneys de-
20
clined to prosecute nearly 52 percent of violent 
21
crimes that occur in Indian country. 
22
(11) Investigation into cases of missing and 
23
murdered Indian women is made difficult for tribal 
24
00:35 Mar 20, 2019
H1585
127 
•HR 1585 IH
law enforcement agencies due to a lack of resources, 
1
such as— 
2
(A) necessary training, equipment, or 
3
funding; 
4
(B) a lack of interagency cooperation; and 
5
(C) a lack of appropriate laws in place. 
6
(12) Domestic violence calls are among the 
7
most dangerous calls that law enforcement receives. 
8
(13) The complicated jurisdictional scheme that 
9
exists in Indian country— 
10
(A) has a significant negative impact on 
11
the ability to provide public safety to Indian 
12
communities; 
13
(B) has been increasingly exploited by 
14
criminals; and 
15
(C) requires a high degree of commitment 
16
and cooperation among tribal, Federal, and 
17
State law enforcement officials. 
18
(14) Restoring and enhancing local, tribal ca-
19
pacity to address violence against women provides 
20
for greater local control, safety, accountability, and 
21
transparency. 
22
(15) In States with restrictive land settlement 
23
acts such as Alaska, ‘‘Indian country’’ is limited, re-
24
sources for local tribal responses either nonexistent 
25
00:35 Mar 20, 2019

•HR 1585 IH
or insufficient to meet the needs, jurisdiction unnec-
1
essarily complicated and increases the already high 
2
levels of victimization of American Indian and Alas-
3
ka Native women. According to the Tribal Law and 
4
Order Act Commission Report, Alaska Native 
5
women are overrepresented in the domestic violence 
6
victim population by 250 percent; they comprise 19 
7
percent of the State population, but are 47 percent 
8
of reported rape victims. And among other Indian 
9
Tribes, Alaska Native women suffer the highest 
10
rates of domestic and sexual violence in the country. 
11
(b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this title are— 
12
(1) to clarify the responsibilities of Federal, 
13
State, tribal, and local governments with respect to 
14
responding to cases of domestic violence, dating vio-
15

(2) to increase coordination and communication 
19
among Federal, State, tribal, and local law enforce-
20

21
(3) to empower tribal governments with the re-
22
