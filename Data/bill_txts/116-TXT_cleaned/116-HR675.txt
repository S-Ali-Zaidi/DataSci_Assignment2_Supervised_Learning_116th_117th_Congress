RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
socialist proposals such as Medicare for All, student loan 
forgiveness, and the Green New Deal with a guaranteed 
job for all, are antithetical to American foundational 
values of self-responsibility and opportunity, and by guar-

anteeing these programs as ‘‘rights’’, we risk abandoning 
our actual rights. 
Whereas, on February 7, 2019, Representative Alexandria 
Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Edward Markey introduced 
H. Res. 109 and S. Res. 59, respectively, resolutions rec-
ognizing the duty of the Federal Government to create a 
Green New Deal; 
Whereas, on February 27, 2019, Representative Pramila 
Jayapal and Senator Bernard Sanders introduced H.R. 
1384 and S. 1129, respectively, legislation to establish a 
Medicare-for-all national health insurance program; 
Whereas several Democratic Presidential candidates have 
proposed tuition-free college or wealth redistribution poli-
cies; 
Whereas, in socialism, the value of States and municipal gov-
ernment goes away and keeps government away from the 
people, instead favoring a centralized ruling body; 
Whereas increasing taxes for Americans to redistribute 
wealth would eliminate the incentive for the American in-
genuity which has made the United States the most pro-
ductive country in the world; 
Whereas eliminating private medical insurance options for 
nearly half of the population currently covered by employ-
ers and replacing it with a government-run system would 
result in a decrease in the quality and availability of care; 
Whereas a guaranteed job for those who are unable or unwill-
ing to work violates the treasured principle of self-respon-
sibility and merit-based opportunity; 
Whereas the late Charles Krauthammer defined the dif-
ference between political rights and economic rights, lik-

ening political rights to examples of free speech, worship, 
and freedom from government overreach, and cultural 
and economic rights as social and economic services guar-
anteed by the state; 
Whereas the idea of social and economic rights creates a de-
pendence on the state for necessities and can begin to re-
place the importance of political rights; 
Whereas there is no form of socialism, whether extreme or 
modified, that has worked in other countries due to civil 
unrest and economic hardship for citizens; 
Whereas the United States is a large robust country with 
enormous economic capacity due to the ability of citizens 
to live unencumbered by arbitrary taxes, fees, and man-
dates from the Federal Government; and 
Whereas socialist proposals create government dependence for 
social services and neglect the identity of American polit-
ical culture and freedom: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-

resentatives that— 
2
(1) the role of the United States Federal Gov-
3
ernment is to provide opportunities to increase indi-
4
vidual economic opportunity and self-empowerment; 
5
(2) the proper role of the United States Federal 
6
Government is governed and outlined by the United 
7
States Constitution; 
8
(3) current socialist proposals are working 
9
against the defined role of government and abandon 
10
the values which make us American;

(4) capitalism is the pinnacle of American de-
1
mocracy and economic freedom; 
2
(5) the aforementioned proposals promote so-
3
cialism and undermine the American founding prin-
4
ciples of individual freedom and liberty; 
5
(6) despite any flaw in our political system, our 
6
political representatives in this compound Republic 
7
should be mindful and committed to promoting indi-
8
vidual responsibility and merit-based opportunity; 
9
(7) our belief is in the individual; government 
10
becomes dangerous when power shifts from the indi-
11
vidual to big government and the collective state; 
12
(8) the United States House of Representatives 
13
promotes capitalism and the free market as a way 
14
to empower Americans across all walks of life to ac-
15
cess economic opportunities and political freedoms; 
16
(9) the United States House of Representatives 
17
should continue to focus on policies which enrich the 
18
American identity by promoting self-responsibility 
19
and fostering opportunities through the free market 
20
and a healthy economy; and 
21
(10) the Federal Government should only do 
22
things that need to be done on the Federal level, like 
23
interstate commerce and the collective defense.
