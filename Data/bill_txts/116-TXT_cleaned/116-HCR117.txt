CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of Congress that the United States 
should resume normal diplomatic relations with Taiwan, 
negotiate a bilateral free trade agreement with Taiwan, 
and support Taiwan’s membership in international orga-
nizations. 
Whereas the people of Taiwan have established a free, open, 
pluralistic, and democratic society; 
Whereas the people of Taiwan have conducted 7 democratic 
Presidential elections yielding 3 peaceful transfers of ad-
ministration, successive democratic elections for members 
of the national legislature, multiple nationwide referenda, 
and numerous local elections;

Whereas Taiwan and its outlying islands have never been 
under the jurisdiction or control of the Communist re-
gime in Beijing, which continues to illegitimately claim 
sovereignty over Taiwan and its people; 
Whereas Communist China has weaponized the so-called 
‘‘One China Policy’’ to block Taiwan’s membership and 
full participation in international organizations and 
events ranging from the United Nations and the World 
Health Organization to the Olympic Games; 
Whereas the so-called ‘‘One China Policy’’ is obsolete, does 
not serve the people of Taiwan or the United States, and 
fails to reflect the obvious reality that Taiwan has been 
a sovereign and independent country for over 70 years; 
Whereas Taiwan maintains diplomatic, cultural, and eco-
nomic links with several countries around the world, dem-
onstrating its clear independence from the People’s Re-
public of China; 
Whereas Taiwan and the United States maintained normal 
diplomatic relations and a Mutual Defense Treaty until 
President Carter abruptly abandoned both without the 
approval of Congress in 1979; 
Whereas Congress responded by adopting the landmark, bi-
partisan Taiwan Relations Act, codifying in law the basis 
for continued friendly relations between the people of the 
United States and Taiwan; 
Whereas former President Reagan strengthened ties with 
Taiwan by issuing the ‘‘Six Assurances’’, noting that the 
United States would not formally recognize Communist 
Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan;
