‘‘Medical Device Sterilization Challenge’’ for carrying out 
1
prize competitions described in this section under section

6
gram, the Director shall provide for prize competitions, 
7
including at least one prize competition to seek solutions 
8
with respect to each of the following goals: 
9
(1) Reduction of the human health hazards as-
10
sociated with ethylene oxide sterilization, including 
11
through reduction of— 
12
(A) the exposure to workers in such facili-
13
ties; and 
14
(B) environmental emissions of ethylene 
15
oxide. 
16
(2) Reduction of the amount of time required to 
17
effectively sterilize devices by a factor of 2 or more 
18
to sterilize the same type and number of devices over 
19
commonly-used ethylene oxide technology without a 
20
proportional increase in cost. 
21
(3) Achievement of rapid implementation of 
22
new sterilization agents or methods that minimize 
23
conversion costs without decreasing facility through-
24
put.

(4) Provision of new or improved approaches to 
1
measuring, monitoring, and controlling ethylene 
2
oxide emissions, including detection at very low lev-
3
els.

(5) Analysis of public health risks of emissions 
5
from currently-available data with respect to emis-
6
sions of public health or provision of— 
7
(A) new or improved tools that use data to 
8
better model emissions over time at the regional 
9
or local scale; or 
10
(B) actionable information on the health 
11
and environmental impacts of ethylene oxide 
12
sterilization to government, industry, and mem-
13
bers of the public. 
14
(6) Enabling of minimally disruptive conversion 
15
of exiting device sterilization facilities that use ethyl-
16
ene oxide to convert to less-toxic methods of steri-
17
lization.
