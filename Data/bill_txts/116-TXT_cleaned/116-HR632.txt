United Nations (referred to in this resolution as the

Whereas the United States Ambassador to the United Na-
tions Agencies for Food and Agriculture, Kip Tom, wrote 
on June 18, 2019, ‘‘The FAO is where the nations of the 
world come together to identify tools and practices to im-
prove agricultural production, to facilitate trade, to en-
hance sustainability, and to extend knowledge in ways 
that can improve the health and well-being of families ev-
erywhere.’’; 
Whereas the member nations of the FAO have unanimously 
designated October 16 of each year as ‘‘World Food

Day’’ as a focal point for year-round programs; and 
Whereas the people of the United States can express their 
concern for the plight of hungry and malnourished people 
throughout the world by study, advocacy, and action:
