SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Equality Act’’. 
2
SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. 
3
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
4
(1) Discrimination can occur on the basis of the 
5
sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or preg-
6
nancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition of 
7
an individual, as well as because of sex-based stereo-
8
types. Each of these factors alone can serve as the 
9
basis for discrimination, and each is a form of sex 
10
discrimination. 
11
(2) A single instance of discrimination may 
12
have more than one basis. For example, discrimina-
13
tion against a married same-sex couple could be 
14
based on the sex stereotype that marriage should 
15
only be between heterosexual couples, the sexual ori-
16
entation of the two individuals in the couple, or 
17
both. Discrimination against a pregnant lesbian 
18
could be based on her sex, her sexual orientation, 
19
her pregnancy, or on the basis of multiple factors. 
20
(3) Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (re-
21
ferred to as ‘‘LGBT’’) people commonly experience 
22
discrimination in securing access to public accom-
23
modations—including restaurants, senior centers, 
24
stores, places of or establishments that provide en-
25
tertainment, health care facilities, shelters, govern-
26

ment offices, youth service providers including adop-
1
tion and foster care providers, and transportation. 
2
Forms of discrimination include the exclusion and 
3
denial of entry, unequal or unfair treatment, harass-
4
ment, and violence. This discrimination prevents the 
5
full participation of LGBT people in society and dis-
6
rupts the free flow of commerce. 
7
(4) Women also have faced discrimination in 
8
many establishments such as stores and restaurants, 
9
and places or establishments that provide other 
10
goods or services, such as entertainment or transpor-
11
tation, including sexual harassment, differential pric-
12
ing for substantially similar products and services, 
13
and denial of services because they are pregnant or 
14
breastfeeding. 
15
(5) Many employers already and continue to 
16
take proactive steps, beyond those required by some 
17
States and localities, to ensure they are fostering 
18
positive and respectful cultures for all employees. 
19
Many places of public accommodation also recognize 
20
the economic imperative to offer goods and services 
21
to as many consumers as possible. 
22
(6) Regular and ongoing discrimination against 
23
LGBT people, as well as women, in accessing public 
24
accommodations contributes to negative social and 
25

economic outcomes, and in the case of public accom-
1
modations operated by State and local governments, 
2
abridges individuals’ constitutional rights. 
3
(7) The discredited practice known as ‘‘conver-
4
sion therapy’’ is a form of discrimination that harms 
5
LGBT people by undermining individuals sense of 
6
self worth, increasing suicide ideation and substance 
7
abuse, exacerbating family conflict, and contributing 
8
to second class status. 
9
(8) Both LGBT people and women face wide-
10
spread discrimination in employment and various 
11
services, including by entities that receive Federal fi-
12
nancial assistance. Such discrimination— 
13
(A) is particularly troubling and inappro-
14
priate for programs and services funded wholly 
15
or in part by the Federal Government; 
16
(B) undermines national progress toward 
17
equal treatment regardless of sex, sexual ori-
18
entation, or gender identity; and 
19
(C) is inconsistent with the constitutional 
20
principle of equal protection under the Four-
21
teenth Amendment to the Constitution of the 
22
United States. 
23
(9) Federal courts have widely recognized that, 
24
in enacting the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Congress 
25
21:38 Mar 13, 2019

•HR 5 IH
validly invoked its powers under the Fourteenth 
1
Amendment to provide a full range of remedies in 
2
response to persistent, widespread, and pervasive 
3
discrimination by both private and government ac-
4
tors. 
5
(10) Discrimination by State and local govern-
6
ments on the basis of sexual orientation or gender 
7
identity in employment, housing, and public accom-
8
modations, and in programs and activities receiving 
9
Federal financial assistance, violates the Equal Pro-
10
tection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the 
11
Constitution of the United States. In many cir-
12
cumstances, such discrimination also violates other 
13
constitutional rights such as those of liberty and pri-
14
vacy under the due process clause of the Fourteenth 
15
Amendment. 
16
(11) Individuals who are LGBT, or are per-
17
ceived to be LGBT, have been subjected to a history 
18
and pattern of persistent, widespread, and pervasive 
19
discrimination on the bases of sexual orientation and 
20
gender identity by both private sector and Federal, 
21
State, and local government actors, including in em-
22
ployment, housing, and public accommodations, and 
23
in programs and activities receiving Federal finan-
24
cial assistance. An explicit and comprehensive na-
25
21:38 Mar 13, 2019

•HR 5 IH
tional solution is needed to address such discrimina-
1
tion, including the full range of remedies available 
2
under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 
3
(12) Numerous provisions of Federal law ex-
4
pressly prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex, 
5
and Federal agencies and courts have correctly in-
6
terpreted these prohibitions on sex discrimination to 
7
include discrimination based on sexual orientation, 
8
gender identity, and sex stereotypes. In particular, 
9
the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission 
10
correctly interpreted title VII of the Civil Rights Act 
11
of 1964 in Macy v. Holder, Baldwin v. Foxx, and 
12
Lusardi v. McHugh. 
13
(13) The absence of explicit prohibitions of dis-
14
crimination on the basis of sexual orientation and 
15
gender identity under Federal statutory law, as well 
16
as the existence of legislative proposals that would 
17
have provided such explicit prohibitions, has led 
18
some courts to conclude incorrectly that current 
19
Federal laws prohibiting sex discrimination do not 
20
prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual ori-
21
entation and gender identity. It has also created un-
22
certainty for employers and other entities covered by 
23
Federal nondiscrimination laws and caused unneces-
24
sary hardships for LGBT individuals.

(14) LGBT people often face discrimination 
1
when seeking to rent or purchase housing, as well as 
2
in every other aspect of obtaining and maintaining 
3
housing. LGBT people in same-sex relationships are 
4
often discriminated against when two names associ-
5
ated with one gender appear on a housing applica-
6
tion, and transgender people often encounter dis-
7
crimination when credit checks or inquiries reveal a 
8
former name. 
9
(15) National surveys, including a study com-
10
missioned by the Department of Housing and Urban 
11
Development, show that housing discrimination 
12
against LGBT people is very prevalent. For in-
13
stance, when same-sex couples inquire about housing 
14
that is available for rent, they are less likely to re-
15
ceive positive responses from landlords. A national 
16
matched-pair testing investigation found that nearly 
17
one-half of same-sex couples face adverse, differen-
18
tial treatment when seeking elder housing. Accord-
19
ing to other studies, transgender people have half 
20
the homeownership rate of non-transgender people 
21
and about 1 in 5 transgender people experience 
22
homelessness. 
23
(16) As a result of the absence of explicit prohi-
24
bitions against discrimination on the basis of sexual 
25

orientation and gender identity, credit applicants 
1
who are LGBT, or perceived to be LGBT, have un-
2
equal opportunities to establish credit. LGBT people 
3
can experience being denied a mortgage, credit card, 
4
student loan, or many other types of credit simply 
5
because of their sexual orientation or gender iden-
6
tity. 
7
(17) Numerous studies demonstrate that LGBT 
8
people, especially transgender people and women, are 
9
economically disadvantaged and at a higher risk for 
10
poverty compared with other groups of people. For 
11
example, older women in same-sex couples have 
12
twice the poverty rate of older different-sex couples. 
13
(18) The right to an impartial jury of one’s 
14
peers and the reciprocal right to jury service are 
15
fundamental to the free and democratic system of 
16
justice in the United States and are based in the 
17
Bill of Rights. There is, however, an unfortunate 
18
and long-documented history in the United States of 
19
attorneys discriminating against LGBT individuals, 
20
or those perceived to be LGBT, in jury selection. 
21
Failure to bar peremptory challenges based on the 
22
actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender 
23
identity of an individual not only erodes a funda-
24
mental right, duty, and obligation of being a citizen

of the United States, but also unfairly creates a sec-
1
ond class of citizenship for LGBT victims, witnesses, 
2
plaintiffs, and defendants. 
3
(19) Numerous studies document the shortage 
4
of qualified and available homes for the 437,000 
5
youth in the child welfare system and the negative 
6
outcomes for the many youth who live in group care 
7
as opposed to a loving home or who age out without 
8
a permanent family. Although same-sex couples are 
9
7 times more likely to foster or adopt than their dif-
10
ferent-sex counterparts, many child placing agencies 
11
refuse to serve same-sex couples and LGBT individ-
12
uals. This has resulted in a reduction of the pool of 
13
qualified and available homes for youth in the child 
14
welfare system who need placement on a temporary 
15
or permanent basis. Barring discrimination in foster 
16
care and adoption will increase the number of homes 
17
available to foster children waiting for foster and 
18
adoptive families. 
19
(20) LGBT youth are overrepresented in the 
20
foster care system by at least a factor of two and 
21
report twice the rate of poor treatment while in care 
22
compared to their non-LGBT counterparts. LGBT 
23
youth in foster care have a higher average number 
24
of placements, higher likelihood of living in a group

home, and higher rates of hospitalization for emo-
1
tional reasons and juvenile justice involvement than 
2
their non-LGBT peers because of the high level of 
3
bias and discrimination that they face and the dif-
4
ficulty of finding affirming foster placements. Fur-
5
ther, due to their physical distance from friends and 
6
family, traumatic experiences, and potentially unsta-
7
ble living situations, all youth involved with child 
8
welfare are at risk for being targeted by traffickers 
9
seeking to exploit children. Barring discrimination in 
10
child welfare services will ensure improved treatment 
11
and outcomes for LGBT foster children.
