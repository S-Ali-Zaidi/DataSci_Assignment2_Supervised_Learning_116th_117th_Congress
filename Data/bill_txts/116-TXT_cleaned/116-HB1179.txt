•HR 1179 IH
(1) From 1619 until 1865, millions of African 
1
Americans throughout the United States were 
2
enslaved. 
3
(2) Slaveholders often controlled where and how 
4
the dead were buried, and prohibited burials on valu-
5
able land. As a result, slave burial grounds were 
6
often confined to remote areas or marginal property. 
7
(3) Such burial grounds were rarely docu-
8
mented, and they infrequently appear on historical 
9
maps. A lack of accurate information is typical of 
10
African-American cemeteries from before the Civil 
11
War. 
12
(4) Following the end of slavery, many African- 
13
American families continued to face restrictions on 
14
where they could bury their dead. Across much of 
15
the United States, local laws segregated burial sites 
16
by race. African-American burial grounds often 
17
failed to receive the type of maintenance and record- 
18
keeping that predominantly White burial grounds 
19
enjoyed. 
20
(5) Many African-American burial grounds 
21
from both before and after the Civil War are in a 
22
state of disrepair or inaccessibility due to overgrowth 
23
of vegetation, crumbling physical structures, and 
24
other challenges.

•HR 1179 IH
(6) There is no official national record or data-
1
base for African-American burial ground locations, 
2
and the location of many sites is unknown. As a re-
3
sult, the family members and descendants of those 
4
interred are unable to visit these sites to honor and 
5
remember their ancestors. 
6
(7) 
Abandoned 
African-American 
burial 
7
grounds are often discovered when construction 
8
projects inadvertently disturb human remains, slow-
9
ing or halting completion of those projects. 
10
(8) The presence and location of historic Afri-
11
can-American burial grounds should be recorded, 
12
and there should be coordinated national, State, 
13
local, and Tribal efforts to preserve and restore 
14
these sites. 
15
(9) African-American burial grounds are an in-
16
tegral component of the heritage of the United 
17
States. 
18
(10) Creating and maintaining a network of 
19
previously abandoned, underserved, and other Afri-
20
can-American burial grounds will help communities 
21
identify and record burial grounds and preserve local 
22
history while better informing development decisions 
23
and community planning.
