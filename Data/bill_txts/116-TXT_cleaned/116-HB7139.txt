•HR 7139 IH
(1) Standards serve as the building blocks for 
1
product development and help ensure functionality, 
2
interoperability, and safety. 
3
(2) Global cooperation and coordination on 
4
standards for emerging technologies will be critical 
5
for having a consistent set of rules to enable market 
6
competition, preclude barriers to trade, and allow in-
7
novation to flourish. 
8
(3) China’s ‘‘Standardization Reform Plan’’ 
9
and ‘‘Five-Year Plan for Standardization’’ highlight 
10
its high-level goals to establish China as a ‘‘stand-
11
ards power’’ by 2020, participate in at least half of 
12
all standards drafting and revision efforts in recog-
13
nized international standards setting organizations, 
14
and to strengthen China’s participation in the gov-
15
ernance of international standards setting organiza-
16
tions. 
17
(4) As emerging technologies develop for global 
18
deployment, it is critical that the United States and 
19
its allies continue to shape standards that underpin 
20
the technologies themselves, and the future inter-
21
national governance of these technologies. 
22
(5) United States position on standardization in 
23
emerging technologies will be critical to United 
24
States economic competitiveness.

(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 180 days after the 
7
date of the enactment of this Act, the Director of the Na-
8
tional Institute of Standards and Technology shall enter 
9
into an agreement with the National Academies of 
10
Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to conduct a study, 
11
and make recommendations with respect to the impact of 
12
Chinese government policies and standards development 
13
on international bodies engaged in developing and setting 
14
international standards for emerging technologies. The 
15
study may include— 
16
(1) an assessment of how China’s role in inter-
17
national standards setting organizations has grown 
18
over the previous 10 years, including in leadership 
19
roles in standards-drafting technical committees, and 
20
the quality or value of that participation; 
21
(2) an assessment of the impact of China’s 
22
standardization strategy, as identified in the ‘‘Chi-
23
nese Standard 2035’’ on international bodies en-
24
gaged in developing and setting standards for select

emerging technologies, such as advanced commu-
1
nication technologies or cloud computing and cloud 
2
services; 
3
(3) an examination of whether international 
4
standards for select emerging technologies are being 
5
designed to promote Chinese government interests 
6
that are expressed in the ‘‘Made in China 2025’’ 
7
plan to the exclusion of other participants; 
8
(4) an examination of how the previous prac-
9
tices China has utilized while participating in inter-
10
national standards setting organizations may foretell 
11
how China will engage in international standardiza-
12
tion activities of critical technologies like artificial 
13
intelligence and quantum information science, and 
14
what may be the consequences; 
15
(5) recommendations on how the United States 
16
can take steps to mitigate Chinese influence in inter-
17
national standards-setting bodies and identify voting 
18
strategies with respect to international consensus 
19
standards for advanced wireless communications 
20
technologies and other critical technologies; and 
21
(6) any other areas the Academies believe is im-
22
portant to address.
