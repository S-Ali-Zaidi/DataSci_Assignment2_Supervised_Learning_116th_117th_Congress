SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

(2) At least 1 out of 2 child care providers 
1
closed at some point during the COVID-19 pan-
2
demic, and 2 out of 5 face the possibility of perma-
3
nent closure. 
4
(3) The lack of access to child care services can 
5
prevent parents from returning to work and can pre-
6
vent children from accessing critical services, includ-
7
ing meals. 
8
(4) Ensuring the safe re-opening and operation 
9
of child care service settings during periods of com-
10
munity transmission of COVID-19 will require child 
11
care providers to adopt new measures and practices 
12
in order to reduce the likelihood of COVID-19 trans-
13
mission. 
14
(5) Such measures and practices must ensure 
15
the safety of children as well as child care workers, 
16
who may be at high risk of infection. 
17
(6) Ensuring that working families have access 
18
to safe child care service options is critical to sup-
19
porting young children’s development and to return-
20
ing the economy back to its pre-pandemic levels.
