To amend the Public Health Service Act to authorize and 
provide for the expansion, intensification, and coordina-
tion of the programs and activities of the National Insti-
tutes of Health with respect to post-viral chronic 
neuroimmune 
diseases, 
specifically 
myalgic 
encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), 
to support the COVID–19 response, and for other pur-
poses.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Understanding 
2
COVID–19 Subsets and ME/CFS Act’’ or the ‘‘U.C.S. 
3
ME/CFS Act’’. 
4
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
5
Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) As of May 27, 2020, the virus that causes 
7
COVID–19 has infected 1.7 million Americans, 
8
many of whom may never recover, and has caused 
9
over 100,000 deaths. 
10
(2) Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue 
11
syndrome (ME/CFS) is a serious, chronic, and 
12
multisystemic disease associated with survivors of 
13
viral infections. 
14
(3) Subsets of COVID–19 patients are pre-
15
senting with ME/CFS symptoms, such as brain in-
16
flammation, and experts expect a significant increase 
17
of ME/CFS cases in the next two years in the 
18
United States following the COVID–19 epidemic. 
19
(4) ME/CFS is characterized by chronic or life-
20
long symptoms across multiple body systems includ-
21
ing post-exertional malaise (PEM), brain inflamma-
22
tion, fever, pain, neurological, immune and cognitive 
23
dysfunction, and swollen glands or tender lymph 
24
nodes which are most likely to appear following a

viral infection, like coronaviruses, Epstein-Barr, or 
1
Q-River fever. 
2
(5) The severity of both COVID–19 and ME/ 
3
CFS ranges from mild to completely debilitating and 
4
in some cases can be lethal. 
5
(6) The cause of ME/CFS is unknown. There 
6
is no diagnostic test for ME/CFS, and there is no 
7
treatment for ME/CFS that is approved by the Food 
8
and Drug Administration. 
9
(7) Physicians are not sufficiently educated on 
10
the proper diagnosis of COVID–19 subsets, ME/ 
11
CFS, or current treatments for ME/CFS. This leads 
12
to excess health care costs, errors in treatments, and 
13
harm to patients. 
14
(8) Patients with ME/CFS frequently suffer for 
15
years before receiving an accurate diagnosis and are 
16
often given harmful treatment recommendations ex-
17
posing them to unnecessary and costly tests and pro-
18
cedures, as well as needless suffering and expense. 
19
(9) The economic impact of ME/CFS is high. 
20
The annual cost in the United States for ME/CFS 
21
is estimated to be between $17,000,000,000 and 
22
$24,000,000,000 in medical expenditures and lost 
23
productivity. The overwhelming majority of people 
24
with ME/CFS are unable to work.

•HR 7057 IH
(10) ME/CFS symptoms are consistent with 
1
other neuroimmune diseases, such as Gulf War Ill-
2
ness, and are recognized as a serious and disabling 
3
issue for military veterans, particularly those who 
4
have been deployed in war zones and experience for-
5
eign toxic or viral exposure. 
6
(11) ME/CFS affects individuals of every age, 
7
racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic group, including 
8
children. Research shows that ME/CFS is two to 
9
four times more likely to occur in women than men. 
10
(12) The National Institute of Neurological 
11
Disorders and Stroke of the National Institutes of 
12
Health unanimously accepted the recent report of 
13
the National Advisory Neurological Disorders and 
14
Stroke (NANDS) Council Working Group for ME/ 
15
CFS which identifies research gaps and opportuni-
16
ties ready for investment.
