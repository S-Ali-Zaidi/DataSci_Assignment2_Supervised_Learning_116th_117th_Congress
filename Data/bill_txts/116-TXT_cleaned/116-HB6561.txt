•HR 6561 IH
(1) Healthy People 2020 defines social deter-
1
minants of health as conditions in the environments 
2
in which people live, learn, work, play, worship, and 
3
age that affect a wide range of health, functioning, 
4
and quality-of-life outcomes and risks. 
5
(2) One of the overarching goals of Healthy 
6
People 2020 is to ‘‘create social and physical envi-
7
ronments that promote good health for all’’. 
8
(3) Healthy People 2020 developed a ‘‘place- 
9
based’’ organizing framework, reflecting five key 
10
areas of social determinants of health namely— 
11
(A) economic stability; 
12
(B) education; 
13
(C) social and community context; 
14
(D) health and health care; and 
15
(E) neighborhood and built environment. 
16
(4) It is estimated that medical care accounts 
17
for only 10 to 20 percent of the modifiable contribu-
18
tors to healthy outcomes for a population. 
19
(5) The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Serv-
20
ices has indicated the importance of the social deter-
21
minants in its work stating that, ‘‘As we seek to fos-
22
ter innovation, rethink rural health, find solutions to 
23
the opioid epidemic, and continue to put patients

first, we need to take into account social deter-
1
minants of health and recognize their importance.’’. 
2
(6) The Department of Health and Human 
3
Services’ Public Health 3.0 initiative recognizes the 
4
role of public health in working across sectors on so-
5
cial determinants of health, as well as the role of 
6
public health as chief health strategist in commu-
7
nities. 
8
(7) Through its Health Impact in 5 Years ini-
9
tiative, the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
10
tion has highlighted nonclinical, community-wide ap-
11
proaches that show positive health impacts, results 
12
within five years, and cost effectiveness or cost sav-
13
ings over the lifetime of the population or earlier. 
14
(8) Health departments and the Centers for 
15
Disease Control and Prevention are not funded for 
16
such cross-cutting work. 
17
(9) Providing grants to public health depart-
18
ments and other eligible entities to coordinate cross- 
19
sector collaboration will allow a community-wide, evi-
20
dence-based approach to address underlying social 
21
determinants of health.
