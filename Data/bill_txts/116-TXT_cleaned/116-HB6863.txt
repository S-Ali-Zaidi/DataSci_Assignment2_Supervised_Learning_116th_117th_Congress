Congress makes the following findings: 
7
(1) The People’s Republic of China, including

9
and the Chinese Communist Party, has mishandled 
10
its management and response to the outbreak of 
11

•HR 6863 IH
coronavirus disease 2019 (commonly known as 
1
‘‘COVID–19’’) in Wuhan, Hubei Province. 
2
(2) On December 31, 2019, the World Health 
3
Organization headquarters in Geneva learned of 
4
pneumonia with an unknown cause, not from Chi-
5
nese authorities, but from a United States-based 
6
listserv, Pro-MED, a platform for sharing early, 
7
open-source intelligence about potential epidemics. 
8
(3) On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Com-
9
munist Party officially announced a coronavirus out-
10
break, 2 days after the World Health Organization 
11
announced an outbreak and 8 days after closing the 
12
Wuhan Hua’nan wet market. 
13
(4) The Chinese Communist Party continually 
14
suppressed medical information, such as early 
15
knowledge of the risk of human-to-human trans-
16
mission of the SARS–CoV–2 virus, which causes 
17
COVID–19, from doctors and medical professionals 
18
while subjecting them to humiliating reprimands. 
19
(5) On January 20, 2020, the Chinese Com-
20
munist Party finally acknowledged that the SARS– 
21
CoV–2 virus can be transmitted human to human, 
22
despite denials as recently as January 15, 2020. 
23
(6) On January 2, 2020, researchers in the 
24
People’s Republic of China completed a genomic 
25

analysis of the SARS–CoV–2 virus, but failed to 
1
share the results with the international community 
2
until January 12, 2020. 
3
(7) On January 6, 2020, officials from the 
4
United States Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
5
vention offered to visit the People’s Republic of 
6
China to help respond to the COVID–19 epidemic, 
7
but the offer was declined by the Chinese Com-
8
munist Party, and the Centers for Disease Control 
9
and Prevention were informed that United States 
10
medical researchers were not permitted to enter the 
11
People’s Republic of China until February 16, 2020, 
12
as part of a World Health Organization delegation. 
13
(8) The Chinese Communist Party exponen-
14
tially increased the spread of COVID–19 domesti-
15
cally and internationally by continuing to permit 
16
international flights well after domestic quarantines 
17
were put in place. 
18
(9) The Chinese Communist Party contributed 
19
to the community spread of COVID–19 by, on Janu-
20
ary 18, 2020, permitting a 40,000-family potluck 
21
banquet in the Bubuting Community of Wuhan as 
22
part of the Lunar New Year festivities. 
23
(10) On March 12, 2020, officials within the 
24
Chinese 
Communist 
Party 
knowingly 
spread 
25

H6863
5 
•HR 6863 IH
disinformation that the SARS–CoV–2 virus had 
1
originated with the United States Armed Forces. 
2
(11) COVID–19 has decimated the global econ-
3
omy, caused trillions of dollars in economic damage, 
4
and cost millions of United States citizens their jobs. 
5
(12) As of the end of April 2020, COVID–19 
6
has— 
7
(A) infected more than 3,000,000 individ-
8
uals globally and almost 1,000,000 people in 
9
the United States; and 
10
(B) caused more than 200,000 deaths 
11
globally and more than 50,000 deaths in the 
12

SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
14
It is the policy of the United States—

16
SARS–CoV–2 virus, including the role the Govern-

TITLE IV—MATTERS RELATING 
18
TO TAIWAN 
19
SEC. 401. PARTICIPATION OF TAIWAN IN THE WORLD 
20
HEALTH ORGANIZATION. 
21
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following find-
22
ings: 
23
(1) The World Health Organization (WHO) is 
24
a specialized agency of the United Nations, charged 
25
18:51 Jun 04, 2020
H6863
25 
•HR 6863 IH
with coordinating health efforts within the United 
1
Nations system. The World Health Assembly 
2
(WHA) is the decision-making body of the WHO, 
3
which convenes annually in May to set the policies 
4
and priorities of the organization. Statehood is not 
5
a requirement for attendance at the WHA, and nu-
6
merous observers, including nonmembers and non-
7
governmental organizations, attended the most re-
8
cent WHA in May 2018. 
9
(2) Taiwan began seeking to participate in the 
10
WHO as an observer in 1997. In 2009, with strong 
11
support from successive United States Administra-
12
tions, Congress, and like-minded WHO Member 
13
States, and during a period of improved Cross-Strait 
14
relations, Taiwan received an invitation to attend 
15
the WHA as an observer under the name ‘‘Chinese 
16
Taipei’’. Taiwan received the same invitation each 
17
year until 2016, when following the election of Presi-
18
dent Tsai-Ing Wen of the Democratic Progressive 
19
Party, Taiwan’s engagement in the international 
20
community began facing increased resistance from 
21
the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Taiwan’s in-
22
vitation to the 2016 WHA was received late and in-
23
cluded new language conditioning Taiwan’s partici-
24
pation on the PRC’s ‘‘one China principle’’. In 2017 
25
18:51 Jun 04, 2020
H6863
26 
•HR 6863 IH
and 2018, Taiwan did not receive an invitation to 
1
the WHA. 
2
(3) Taiwan remains a model contributor to 
3
world health, having provided financial and technical 
4
assistance to respond to numerous global health 
5
challenges. 
Taiwan 
has 
invested 
over 
6
$6,000,000,000 in international medical and human-
7
itarian aid efforts impacting over 80 countries since 
8
1996. In 2014, Taiwan responded to the Ebola crisis 
9
by donating $1,000,000 and providing 100,000 sets 
10
of personal protective equipment. Through the Glob-
11
al Cooperation and Training Framework, the United 
12
States and Taiwan have jointly conducted training 
13
programs for experts to combat MERS, Dengue 
14
Fever, and Zika. These diseases know no borders, 
15
and Taiwan’s needless exclusion from global health 
16
cooperation increases the dangers presented by glob-
17
al pandemics. 
18
(4) Taiwan’s international engagement has 
19
faced increased resistance from the PRC. Taiwan 
20
was not invited to the 2016 Assembly of the Inter-
21
national Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), despite 
22
participating as a guest at the organization’s prior 
23
summit in 2013. Taiwan’s requests to participate in 
24
the General Assembly of the International Criminal 
25

H6863
27 
•HR 6863 IH
Police Organization (INTERPOL) have also been 
1
rejected. In May 2017, PRC delegates disrupted a 
2
meeting of the Kimberley Process on conflict dia-
3
monds held in Perth, Australia, until delegates from 
4
Taiwan were asked to leave. Since 2016, the Demo-
5
cratic Republic of Sa˜o Tome´ and Prı´ncipe, the Re-
6
public of Panama, the Dominican Republic, Burkina 
7
Faso, the Republic of El Salvador, the Solomon Is-
8
lands, and Kiribati have terminated longstanding 
9
diplomatic relationships with Taiwan and granted 
10
diplomatic recognition to the PRC. 
11
(5) Congress has established a policy of support 
12
for Taiwan’s participation in international bodies 
13
that address shared transnational challenges, par-
14
ticularly in the WHO. Congress passed H.R. 1794 
15
in the 106th Congress, H.R. 428 in the 107th Con-
16
gress, and S. 2092 in the 108th Congress to direct 
17
the Secretary of State to establish a strategy for, 
18
and to report annually to Congress on, efforts to ob-
19
tain observer status for Taiwan at the WHA. Con-
20
gress also passed H.R. 1151 in the 113th Congress, 
21
directing the Secretary to report on a strategy to 
22
gain observer status for Taiwan at the ICAO Assem-
23
bly, and H.R. 1853 in the 114th Congress, directing 
24
the Secretary to report on a strategy to gain ob-
