RESOLUTION 
Reaffirming the importance of upholding democracy, human 
rights, and the rule of law in United States foreign policy. 
Whereas strong democracies make strong partners for the 
United States in fostering the peace and prosperity that 
our citizens desire; 
Whereas democratic principles and values have come under 
increasing strain around the world as foreign govern-
ments backslide on their commitments to govern justly, 
transparently, and with respect for the rights of their 
citizens; 
Whereas support for democracy, human rights, and the rule 
of law are consistent with our national character and 
founding values;

Whereas the promotion, protection, and advancement of de-
mocracy, human rights, and the rule of law around the 
world have been core, bipartisan components of United 
States foreign policy essential to the achievement of other 
United States foreign policy goals, including reducing 
poverty, promoting peaceful resolution of conflict, 
strengthening global alliances, ensuring gender equality, 
expanding prosperity, fostering greater security for all 
people, and sustaining the global environment; 
Whereas the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 states that ‘‘a 
principal goal of the foreign policy of the United States 
is to promote the increased observance of internationally 
recognized human rights by all countries’’; 
Whereas it is longstanding United States policy to work 
alongside like-minded democratic governments, legisla-
tures, civil society leaders and organizations, academic in-
stitutions and scholars, independent media and journal-
ists, anti-corruption activists, and international organiza-
tions worldwide to promote, protect and advance the 
cause of democracy, human rights, and the rule of law; 
Whereas human rights defenders and journalists play a crit-
ical role in promoting human rights, transparency, ac-
countability, and good governance, and around the world 
often face smear campaigns, criminalization, or other 
governmental constraints on their work, including intimi-
dation, death threats, arbitrary detention, physical at-
tacks, sexual violence, enforced disappearances, and mur-
der; 
Whereas support for democracy around the world enhances 
regional peace and stability, opens doors for economic op-
portunity, and provides a counterweight to violent and

radical extremism—all of which is in the national secu-
rity interests of the United States and its allies; 
Whereas democratic systems of government enshrine the indi-
vidual human rights of all citizens, so that every indi-
vidual can contribute to and enjoy the benefits of peace-
ful, prosperous societies; 
Whereas the United States supports the existence of and has 
often worked in partnership with independent and multi-
lateral human rights organizations, both at local and 
international levels, and has used their reporting for pol-
icy development and referred to their findings in the an-
nual Department of State Country Reports on Human 
Rights Practices and other United States policy docu-
ments; 
Whereas the idea of America enshrined in our democratic 
principles is one of our greatest competitive strengths, 
such that when we abandon these values and adopt the 
flawed principles and tactics of our adversaries, we be-
come weaker as a country and undermine our standing 
around the world; 
Whereas some countries are actively promoting an authori-
tarian model of government as an alternative to the 
model long advanced by the United States based on de-
mocracy, human rights, and the rule of law, with the au-
thoritarian model representing a threat to the role and 
influence of the United States in the world; 
Whereas some countries hostile to the democratic principles 
and values the United States has long promoted are also 
working to erode international alliances and organizations 
dedicated to advancing those principles, thereby placing
