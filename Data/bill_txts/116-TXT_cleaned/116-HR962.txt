RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for assisting East African countries 
afflicted by the plague of desert locusts. 
Whereas the United States Agency for International Develop-
ment reports that East Africa is currently suffering the 
worst locust outbreak in decades, which will devour crops 
and pasture across that region; 
Whereas there are more than 25 million people experiencing 
severe food insecurity in Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South 
Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda and Sudan, and untold more 
will be at risk if the locusts, currently in their most vul-
nerable state, are not controlled using airborne pesticides, 
before they mature into full grown locusts; 
Whereas the World Food Programme (WFP) reports that 
there may be insufficient resources to conduct aerial

spraying to address the outbreak of desert locusts that is 
currently devastating East Africa; 
Whereas the locust situation in the Horn of Africa, particu-
larly in Kenya, Ethiopia, and Somalia represents an un-
precedented threat to food security and livelihoods; 
Whereas a relatively small investment now to help eradicate 
the locusts will obviate or ameliorate the need for a much 
larger United States emergency aid effort later; 
Whereas Executive Director for the WFP David Beasley re-
cently stated ‘‘Do nothing now and WFP will need up to 
15 times that amount—more than US $1 billion—to as-
sist people devastated by losing crops and livelihoods.’’; 
Whereas United States Ambassador to the United Nations 
food agencies in Rome Kip Tom has been coordinating 
efforts between the WFP and the Food and Agriculture 
Organization (FAO), offering support for locust eradi-
cation efforts and calling attention to areas which FAO 
needs to better address, including the safe application of 
pesticides, management of weak supply chains, coordina-
tion of aerial eradication campaigns, and use of digital 
surveillance tools; 
Whereas air assets capable of being deployed to support lo-
cust control efforts in East Africa potentially include the 
United States Air Force 910 Airlift Wing, based in 
Youngstown, Ohio, and those of contractors whose planes 
are routinely used by the United States Government; and 
Whereas prioritization of responses to the Coronavirus Dis-
ease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and travel restrictions 
resulting from the pandemic have created additional 
logistical challenges to locust eradication efforts, includ-
