Whereas, on April 4, 2019, the House of Representatives 
passed H.R. 1585, the Violence Against Women Reau-
thorization Act of 2019, to expand existing prohibitions 
on firearm access for domestic abusers to those convicted

Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) affirms that reducing access to a firearm 
2

3
women, including stalking and threats of violence, is 
4
critical to reducing the fatality of intimate partner 
5
violence in the United States; 
6
(2) acknowledges that current law falls short in 
7
protecting women who are victims of intimate part-
8
ner violence from unnecessary risk of firearm vio-
9
lence because an abuser can exploit legal loopholes 
10
to access a firearm; 
11
(3) recognizes that perpetrators of firearm vio-
12
lence often have a history of violence against women 
13
and that a successful firearm violence prevention 
14
strategy must meaningfully address this connection; 
15
(4) acknowledges the need for legislation to bet-
16
ter prevent individuals with a history of violence 
17
against women from purchasing or possessing a fire-
18
arm;
