departments and under the custody of law enforce-
1
ment. 
2
(2) Emergency departments and the criminal 
3
justice system do not have the capacity with existing 
4
resources and health care professional shortages to 
5
address the needs of the rapidly growing number of 
6
individuals with mental health conditions, increasing 
7
the risk of adverse patient outcomes. 
8
(3) In 2017, 150,000 individuals in the United 
9
States died from alcohol and drug-induced fatalities 
10
and suicides. Nearly 1⁄3, or more than 47,000 were 
11
suicides. 
12
(4) From 2016 to 2018, more than 1⁄4 of hos-
13
pital emergency department ‘‘frequent users’’ in Illi-
14
nois were patients with presenting or underlying 
15
mental health conditions, underscoring the need for 
16
additional funding, continued access to real-time 
17
care and connection to long-term treatment options. 
18
(5) Fifteen percent of men and 30 percent of 
19
women in custody of county jails have severe mental 
20
illnesses. 
21
(6) Use of appropriate crisis facilities and inter-
22
ventions in Maricopa County, Arizona, have saved 
23
emergency departments an estimated $37,000,000 in

2016 and saved the equivalent of 37 police officer

full-time equivalent salaries. 
2
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
3
gress that— 
4
(1) for patients with mental health issues, co-
5
ordination of physical and mental health services 
6
and cooperation with law enforcement are essential 
7
to ensure timely, appropriate care; and 
8
(2) crisis care networks established at State 
9
and local levels have saved resources and shown im-
10
proved outcomes for patients in crisis.
