A BILL 
To require a determination as to whether crimes committed 
against the Rohingya in Burma amount to genocide. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Rohingya Genocide 
4
Determination Act of 2020’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress makes the following findings: 
7
(1) Since August 25, 2017, 740,000 Rohingya 
8
have fled northern Rakhine State to neighboring 
9
Bangladesh to escape a systematic campaign of

atrocities by Burma’s military and security forces, 
1
and three years later, conditions are still not condu-
2
cive to the safe, voluntary, and dignified return of 
3
the Rohingya to Burma. 
4
(2) On November 23, 2017, the United States 
5
Holocaust Museum and Fortify Rights released a re-
6
port entitled ‘‘They Tried to Kill Us All’’, docu-
7
menting widespread and systematic atrocities com-
8
mitted against Rohingya civilians at the hands of 
9
Burmese ‘‘security forces, civilian perpetrators, and 
10
militants’’ and highlighting ‘‘growing evidence of 
11
genocide.’’ 
12
(3) According to the Department of State’s Au-
13
gust 24, 2018, report entitled ‘‘Documentation of 
14
Atrocities in Northern Rakhine State,’’ violence com-
15
mitted by the Burmese military against the 
16
Rohingya, including from August to October 2017, 
17
was not only ‘‘extreme, large-scale, widespread, and 
18
seemingly geared toward both terrorizing the popu-
19
lation and driving out the Rohingya residents,’’ but 
20
also ‘‘well-planned and coordinated’’. 
21
(4) On August 28, 2018, the United States 
22
Ambassador to the United Nations told the United 
23
Nations Security Council that the Department of 
24
State report’s findings were ‘‘consistent with’’ those

in an August 27, 2018, report by the Independent 
1
International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar 
2
(IIFFMM) which urged that top Burmese military 
3
officials be investigated and prosecuted for genocide. 
4
(5) On September 12, 2018, the IIFFMM re-
5
ported, ‘‘The crimes in Rakhine State, and the man-
6
ner in which they were perpetrated, are similar in 
7
nature, gravity and scope to those that have allowed 
8
genocidal intent to be established in other con-
9
texts.’’. 
10
(6) The Public International Law & Policy 
11
Group (PILPG), whose investigation informed the 
12
Department of State’s August 2018 report, pub-
13
lished in December 2018 its Factual Findings & 
14
Legal Analysis Report, which concluded that ‘‘there 
15
are reasonable grounds to believe that genocide was 
16
committed against the Rohingya in Myanmar’s 
17
northern Rakhine State’’. 
18
(7) According to the PILPG report, ‘‘The scale 
19
and severity of the attacks and abuses—particularly 
20
the mass killings and accompanying brutality 
21
against children, women, pregnant women, the elder-
22
ly, religious leaders, and persons fleeing into Ban-
23
gladesh—suggest that, in the minds of the perpetra-
24

tors, the goal was not just to expel, but also to ex-
1
terminate the Rohingya.’’. 
2
(8) On December 13, 2018, the House of Rep-
3
resentatives agreed to H. Res. 1091, which states 
4
that ‘‘it is the sense of the House of Representatives 
5
that . . . the atrocities committed against the 
6
Rohingya by the Burmese military and security 
7
forces since August 2017 constitute crimes against 
8
humanity and genocide’’. 
9
(9) On September 16, 2019, the IIFFMM re-
10
ported that it ‘‘has reasonable grounds to conclude 
11
that the evidence that infers genocidal intent on the 
12
part of the State, identified in its last report, has 
13
strengthened that there is a serious risk that geno-
14
cidal actions may occur or recur’’. 
15
(10) The IIFFMM also recognized in its Sep-
16
tember 16, 2019, report that Burma’s military and 
17
security forces have committed abuses against mi-
18
nority groups other than the Rohingya: ‘‘All the eth-
19
nic minority communities that the Mission inves-
20
tigated,’’ including ethnic groups in Rakhine, Chin, 
21
Kayin, Kachin, and Shan States, ‘‘have been de-
22
prived of justice for the serious human rights viola-
23
tions perpetrated against them.’’.
