(1) Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl sub-
1
stances have emerged as pervasive contaminants in 
2
sources of drinking water and water to be treated by 
3
treatment works. 
4
(2) Such substances are not naturally occur-
5
ring, but are present in water because of manufac-
6
turing and distribution of PFAS in commerce. 
7
(3) Such substances pose serious risks to 
8
health, including risks of cancer, reproductive and 
9
developmental effects, and effects on the immune 
10
system, liver, and kidneys. 
11
(4) Because of these risks, regulatory limits 
12
continue to be established for PFAS in drinking 
13
water and effluent from treatment works. 
14
(5) Removing PFAS from water results in sig-
15
nificant ongoing operation and maintenance costs. 
16
(6) Those costs are currently borne by commu-
17
nity water systems and treatment works, and in turn 
18
by ratepayers. 
19
(7) Those costs should rightly be borne by the 
20
manufacturers of PFAS, who are using community 
21
water systems and treatment works to remove their 
22
pollution from the environment.
