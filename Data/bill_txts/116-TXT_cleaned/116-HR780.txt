RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
upon adoption by the House, the Speaker of the House 
is required to transmit without delay articles of impeach-
ment to the Senate and must do so immediately. 
Whereas the Constitution grants the ‘‘sole Power of Impeach-
ment’’ to the House of Representatives as a body, not to 
the Speaker or any individual Representative;

•HRES 780 IH 
Whereas, on December 18, 2019, in a purely partisan vote, 
a majority of the House of Representatives voted to 
adopt 2 articles of impeachment against Donald John 
Trump, President of the United States; 
Whereas shortly after the House of Representatives voted to 
adopt the 2 articles of impeachment, Speaker of the 
House Nancy Pelosi unilaterally decided to withhold 
transmitting the articles pending information on the Sen-
ate’s trial procedures while stating ‘‘right now the presi-
dent is impeached’’; 
Whereas the House of Representatives completes its constitu-
tionally mandated impeachment functions upon adopting 
an article of impeachment; 
Whereas the Constitution grants the Senate the ‘‘sole Power 
to try all Impeachments’’; and 
Whereas the Constitution provides, and the Supreme Court 
has affirmed, that the Senate has wide discretion to de-
termine the procedures for conducting an impeachment 
trial: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) finds that— 
2
(A) the Constitution obligates the House of 
3
Representatives to transmit without delay arti-
4
cles of impeachment to the Senate upon adop-
5
tion by the House; and 
6
(B) the Speaker of the House of Rep-
7
resentatives refusal to transmit articles of im-
8
peachment to the Senate is an abuse of power;

(2) strongly disapproves of the Speaker of the 
1
House of Representatives unilateral and unwar-
2
ranted decision to refuse to transmit the 2 articles 
3
of impeachment adopted on December 18, 2019, by 
4
a majority of the House in an attempt to improperly 
5
control impeachment trial procedures in the Senate; 
6
and 
7
(3) demands the Speaker immediately transmit 
8
the articles of impeachment to the Senate to allow 
9
it to exercise its ‘‘sole Power to try all Impeach-
10
ments.’’.
