(a) REVIEW.—The Secretary of State shall review the 
4
cases of citizens and nationals of the United States de-
5
tained abroad to determine if there is credible information 
6
that they are being detained unlawfully or wrongfully, 
7
based on criteria including whether— 
8
(1) the detained individual has presented cred-
9
ible information of factual innocence to United 
10
States officials; 
11
(2) information exists that the individual is de-
12
tained solely or substantially because he or she is a 
13
citizen or national of the United States; 
14
(3) information exists that the individual is 
15
being detained in violation of internationally pro-
16
tected rights and freedoms, such as freedom of ex-
17
pression, association, assembly, and religion; 
18
(4) the individual is being detained in violation 
19
of the laws of the detaining country; 
20
(5) independent nongovernmental organizations

22

•HR 1611 IH
(7) police reports show evidence of the lack of 
1
a credible investigation; 
2
(8) the individual is detained in a country 
3
where the Department of State has determined in its 
4
annual human rights reports that the judicial system 
5
is not independent or impartial, is susceptible to cor-
6
ruption, or is incapable of rendering just verdicts; 
7
(9) the individual is detained in inhumane con-
8
ditions; and 
9
(10) the international right to due process of 
10
law has been sufficiently impaired so as to render 
11
the detention arbitrary.

13
determination by the Secretary of State that there is cred-
14
ible information that the detention of a United States na-
