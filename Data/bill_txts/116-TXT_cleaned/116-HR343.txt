Whereas the observance of the Muslim holy month of Rama-
dan commences at dusk on May 5, 2019, and continues 
for one lunar month; 
Whereas one of the purposes of fasting during the holy 
month of Ramadan is for Muslims to gain a better un-
derstanding of the plight faced by those who are less for-
tunate; 
Whereas Muslims contribute greatly to charitable organiza-
tions that help people from all faiths in the United States 
and around the world by providing medical assistance, 
family services, scholastic supplies, before- and after- 
school programs, feeding the hungry, and providing recu-
peration efforts following natural disasters; 
Whereas Thomas Jefferson was the first President to host an 
iftar, the meal breaking fast during Ramadan, at the 
White House in 1805 and every President since 1996 has 
hosted an iftar for members of the community during 
their presidencies; 
Whereas the Department of State and United States Agency 
for International Development have hosted iftars through 
the years for staff and members of the diplomatic com-
munity; 
Whereas the Department of Agriculture has hosted iftar din-
ners since 2008 to recognize and welcome interfaith dia-
logue and collaboration with individuals and organiza-
tions whose core values often overlap significantly with 
the mission of the Department, including disaster recov-
ery, reducing food waste, ensuring access to nutritious 
food, and fostering safe, prosperous, and thriving commu-
nities;
