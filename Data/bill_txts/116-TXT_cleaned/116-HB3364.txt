1
CERS REGARDING THE USE OF BODY CAM-
2
ERAS.

(a) Uniformed officers with the authority to conduct 
4
searches and make arrests shall wear a body camera. Such 
5
body cameras shall— 
6
(1) have a field of view at least as broad as the 
7
officer’s vision; and 
8
(2) be worn in a manner that maximizes the 
9
camera’s ability to capture video footage of the offi-
10
cer’s activities. 
11
(b) Both the video and audio recording functions of 
12
the body camera shall be activated whenever a uniformed 
13
officer is responding to a call for service or at the initiation 
14
of any other law enforcement or investigative encounter 
15
between a uniformed officer and a member of the public, 
16
except that when an immediate threat to the officer’s life 
17
or safety makes activating the camera impossible or dan-
18
gerous, the officer shall activate the camera at the first 
19
reasonable opportunity to do so. The body camera shall 
20
not be deactivated until the encounter has fully concluded 
21
and the uniformed officer leaves the scene. 
22
(c) A uniformed officer who is wearing a body camera 
23
shall notify any subject of the recording that he or she 
24
is being recorded by a body camera as close to the incep-
25
tion of the encounter as is reasonably possible.

10
camera.

12
victim, a uniformed officer shall, as soon as prac-
13
ticable, ask the apparent crime victim if the appar-
