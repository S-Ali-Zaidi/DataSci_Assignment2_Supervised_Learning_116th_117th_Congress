RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the 20th anniversary of the International Space 
Station. 
Whereas, since November 2000, the International Space Sta-
tion (ISS) has been continuously occupied by more than 
240 astronauts from the United States and other coun-
tries, during that time, have conducted over 3,000 experi-
ments in microgravity environment, focusing on human 
health, exploration, space studies, engineering develop-
ment, and materials testing; 
Whereas the activities conducted on the ISS continue to help 
develop the National Aeronautics and Space Administra-
tion’s (NASA) capabilities for long-duration, deep-space 
missions to the Moon and Mars, and are assisting busi-
nesses, other government agencies, and university re-

searchers to develop knowledge and products that have 
and will result in benefits to humanity for years to come; 
Whereas with its many ongoing research projects and its edu-
cational outreach touching the lives of people around the 
world, the ISS is the world’s preeminent spaceflight pro-
gram today, helping to improve life on Earth even as it 
inspires our species to reach for the stars; 
Whereas as a joint project of the NASA, the Russian Federal 
Space Agency, the European Space Agency, the Canadian 
Space Agency, and the Japan Aerospace Exploration 
Agency, the ISS is the result of a remarkable collabora-
tion between 15 countries, sharing the most advanced 
technologies in the world for the peaceful and the produc-
tive use of space; 
Whereas NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, 
is the American headquarters for the ISS, one of the 
most impressive scientific and engineering achievements 
in history; 
Whereas NASA’s industry contractors and suppliers who 
helped design, build, integrate, and now operate the sta-
tion have provided a critical service to the United States 
and NASA, as well as international partner agencies and 
the astronaut crews that have lived and served aboard 
the ISS for over 20 years; 
Whereas as the largest structure that humans have ever put 
into space, the ISS is made up of pressurized modules 
held together by external trusses and powered by a vast 
array of solar panels; 
Whereas the ISS is the length of a football field, and the 
solar array has the wingspan of a Boeing 777;

Whereas orbiting the globe every 92 minutes at an altitude 
of roughly 250 miles, the ISS is large enough to be seen 
from the surface of the Earth by the naked eye; 
Whereas the ISS has been significantly upgraded to allow for 
an extension of its mission to enable cutting edge re-
search; 
Whereas the ISS is the key enabler of commercial opportuni-
ties in low-Earth orbit; 
Whereas the ISS platform is essential to furthering human 
exploration by providing critical research and system test-
ing for upcoming crewed exploration missions to the 
Moon and Mars; and 
Whereas the ISS is critical to maintaining United States 
leadership in low-Earth orbit: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) recognizes the 20th anniversary of the 
2
International Space Station (ISS); 
3
(2) commends the National Aeronautics and
