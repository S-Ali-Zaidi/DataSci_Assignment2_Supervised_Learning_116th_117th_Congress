•HR 97 IH
(1) Wildlife trafficking is a major transnational 
1
crime that is estimated to generate over $10 billion 
2
a year in illegal profits and which is increasingly 
3
perpetrated by organized, sophisticated criminal en-
4
terprises, including known terrorist organizations. 
5
(2) Wildlife trafficking not only threatens en-
6
dangered species worldwide, but also jeopardizes 
7
local security, spreads disease, undermines rule of 
8
law, fuels corruption, and damages economic devel-
9
opment. 
10
(3) Combating wildlife trafficking requires a co-
11
ordinated and sustained approach at the global, re-
12
gional, national, and local levels. 
13
(4) Congress stated in the Eliminate, Neu-
14
tralize, and Disrupt Wildlife Trafficking Act of 2016 
15
that it is the policy of the United States to take im-
16
mediate actions to stop the illegal global trade in 
17
wildlife and wildlife products and associated transna-
18
tional organized crime. 
19
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
20
gress that the Department of State’s rewards program is 
21
a powerful tool in combating sophisticated international 
22
crime and that the Department of State and Federal law 
23
enforcement should work in concert to offer rewards that 
24
target wildlife traffickers.
