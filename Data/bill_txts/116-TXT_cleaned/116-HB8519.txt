Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Teaching Asian Pacific 
4
American History Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) The United States of America has benefited 
8
from the integral role Asian Americans and Pacific 
9
Islanders have played in our country’s history and 
10
contributions to the world. 
11
(2) The Pacific Island Territories of Guam, 
12
American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the 
13
Northern Mariana Islands have unique histories that 
14
are often overlooked in American history despite 
15
their immense contributions to our Nation. 
16
(3) The traditional American K–12 curriculum 
17
continues to be taught from a Eurocentric point of 
18
view and exclude histories of racist immigration laws 
19
relevant to policies today. 
20
(4) K–12 social studies textbooks poorly rep-
21
resent Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, over-

•HR 8519 IH
look the diversity within those communities, and 
1
print images of Asian Americans and Pacific Island-
2
ers in stereotypical roles. 
3
(5) The Federal Government, through support 
4
for educational activities of national museums estab-
5
lished under Federal law, can assist teachers in ef-
6
forts to incorporate historically accurate instruction 
7
on the comprehensive history of Asian Americans 
8
and Pacific Islanders and assist students in their ex-
9
ploration of Asian Pacific American history as an in-
10
tegral part of American history. 
11
(6) The history of America’s system of immi-
12
gration is rife with racism, embedded in goals of hir-
13
ing workers to work for cheaper wages and labor in 
14
heinous working conditions. 
15
(7) Congress has continuously passed anti- 
16
Asian laws as the result of the scapegoating of Asian 
17
immigrant laborers for the United States economic 
18
downturns. 
19
(8) The history of South Asian Americans in 
20
the United States dates back to the late 1700s. 
21
(9) The history of Native Hawaiians and Pa-
22
cific Islanders in what is now considered to be the 
23
United States predates the founding of our Nation.

(10) In 1993, Congress passed a resolution that 
1
was signed into law formally apologizing for the 
2
United States role in the illegal overthrow of the 
3
Kingdom of Hawaii, which resulted in the suppres-
4
sion of the inherent sovereignty of the Native Ha-
5
waiian people. 
6
(11) Twelve thousand Chinese laborers worked 
7
in atrocious conditions to build the Transcontinental 
8
Railroad, many dying from harsh weather conditions 
9
and the dangers of handling explosives. 
10
(12) After the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 
11
banned Chinese immigrants from immigrating to the 
12
United States, Japanese were hired. After the Japa-
13
nese were banned from immigrating due to the Gen-
14
tleman’s Agreement of 1907, which halted immigra-
15
tion from Japan, Filipinos were hired under 3-year 
16
contracts. 
17
(13) Filipino farm workers helped found the 
18
farm worker labor movement. 
19
(14) The Immigration Act of 1917 restricted 
20
immigration to the United States by barring immi-
21
gration from the Asia-Pacific zone. 
22
(15) The Immigration Act of 1924 set a na-
23
tional origin quota to deter immigration.

(16) The Immigration Act of 1965 made family 
1
unification and skills-based migration the bedrock 
2
principle of immigration to the United States. 
3
(17) The United States conducted nuclear test-
4
ing on the Bikini and Enewetak Atoll of the Mar-
5
shall Islands have made parts of the island nation 
6
uninhabitable and caused forced migration and 
7
health complications that still impact the community 
8
today. 
9
(18) The United States ratified a Compact of 
10
Free Association with the Federated States of Mi-
11
cronesia, Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the 
12
Republic of Palau enabling citizens of these Pacific 
13
Island nations to legally migrate to the United 
14
States visa-free while the United States retains cer-
15
tain strategic military rights over their territorial 
16
waters. 
17
(19) In the aftermath of the Vietnam War, the 
18
Refugee Act of 1980 helped more than 500,000 
19
Southeast Asians gain permanent resident status in 
20
the United States within the first decade of its pas-
21
sage. 
22
(20) President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Execu-
23
tive Order 9066 authorized the incarceration of over 
24

•HR 8519 IH
120,000 persons of Japanese ancestry, two-thirds of 
1
whom were American citizens, based solely on race. 
2
(21) The Pacific Islander community represents 
3
the largest concentration of any ethnic group en-
4
listed in the United States military, as well as rep-
5
resenting the highest numbers of casualties in the 
6
current wars on terror. 
7
(22) The ‘‘model minority’’ myth perpetuates 
8
the stigma of Asian Americans as perpetual for-
9
eigners, and such stereotypes are used to pit minor-
10
ity groups against one another. 
11
(23) The pattern of hate crimes and hate inci-
12
dents directed at Asians and Asian Americans has 
13
repeated itself throughout history. 
14
(24) Asian-American and African-American his-
15
tories of fighting against oppression and racism are 
16
intertwined, from the Black Power Movement of the 
17
1960s that birthed the Asian American Movement to 
18
civil rights protests today. 
19
(25) Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and 
20
their allies continue to fight discrimination, racial 
21
prejudice, hate crimes, scapegoating, structural rac-
22
ism, economic inequities, and benign and overt omis-
23
sion of the integral role they played in the develop-
24
ment of this country.
