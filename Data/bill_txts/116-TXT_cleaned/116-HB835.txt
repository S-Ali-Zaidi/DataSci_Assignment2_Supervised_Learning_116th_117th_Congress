SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Rodchenkov Anti- 
2
Doping Act of 2019’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) Doping fraud conspiracies which affect the 
6
results of Major International Sport Competitions 
7
harm the clean athletes, including the United States 
8
athletes, who participate in those competitions by 
9
denying them their due recognition and economic re-
10
wards. 
11
(2) Doping fraud conspiracies which affect the 
12
results of Major International Sport Competitions 
13
also harm the sponsors of clean athletes, including 
14
United States sponsors, whose sponsored athletes 
15
participate in these competitions by denying the 
16
sponsors the recognition they would have received 
17
had their sponsored athletes not been cheated out of 
18
their rightful placement by doped competitors. 
19
(3) Doping fraud conspiracies which affect the 
20
results of Major International Sport Competitions 
21
also harm the sponsors of those competitions by de-
22
basing the legitimacy of the product which they have 
23
paid to sponsor. 
24
(4) Doping fraud conspiracies which affect the 
25
results of Major International Sport Competitions 
26

•HR 835 IH
also harm the media companies which broadcast 
1
those competitions by debasing the legitimacy of the 
2
product which they have paid to broadcast. 
3
(5) Doping fraud conspiracies which affect the 
4
results of Major International Sport Competitions 
5
also harm the general public who pay to watch these 
6
competitions in the expectation that they will be fair 
7
competitions competed on a level playing field. 
8
(6) Doping fraud conspiracies which affect the 
9
results of Major International Sport Competitions 
10
also hurt the sport organizations whose athletes par-
11
ticipate in those competitions because their sup-
12
porters assume that the competitions in which the 
13
athletes participate are fair competitions which em-
14
body the fundamental social values of sport and not 
15
sham exhibitions rigged in favor of cheaters who 
16
dope. 
17
(7) Doping fraud conspiracies in Major Inter-
18
national Sporting Competitions undermine the integ-
19
rity and value of not only those events but all orga-
20
nized sport around the world, including the United 
21
States. 
22
(8) The economic impact of sport in the United 
23
States economy exceeds over $500,000,000,000 
24
yearly. Doping fraud conspiracies in Major Inter-
25
04:18 Feb 07, 2019
H835
4 
•HR 835 IH
national Sport Competitions seriously threaten the 
1
value of that sector of the United States economy. 
2
(9) Doping fraud conspiracies often beget other 
3
illegal activity, including bribery and money laun-
4
dering. 
5
(10) The World Anti-Doping Code, which first 
6
went into effect in 2003, has been an effective tool 
7
in the fight against international doping by signifi-
8
cantly harmonizing the anti-doping rules of sport 
9
and the national laws of those countries which ad-
10
dress sport doping through legislation. 
11
(11) On August 25, 2003, the United States 
12
ratified the Convention. As a party to the Conven-
13
tion, the United States has agreed to ‘‘adopt appro-
14
priate measures at the national and international 
15
levels which are consistent with the Code . . . In 
16
abiding by the obligations contained in this Conven-
17
tion, each State Party undertakes to adopt appro-
18
priate measures. Such measures may include legisla-
19
tion, regulation, policies or administrative practices.’’ 
20
(12) USADA was recognized by Congress, 
21
under the United States Anti-Doping Agency Reau-
22
thorization Act (Public Law 113–280; 128 Stat. 
23
3020), as the independent anti-doping organization 
24
for the amateur athletic competitions recognized by 
25
04:18 Feb 07, 2019
H835
5 
•HR 835 IH
the United States Olympic Committee. Both 
1
USADA and the United States Olympic Committee 
2
are Signatories to the World Anti-Doping Code. 
3
(13) The mission of USADA is to preserve the 
4
integrity of competition, inspire true sport, and pro-
5
tect the rights of athletes. 
6
(14) As a party to the Convention, the United 
7
States has also agreed to ‘‘insure the application of 
8
the present Convention, notably through domestic 
9
coordination. To meet their obligations under [the] 
10
Convention, States Parties may rely on Anti-Doping 
11
Organizations as well as sports authorities and orga-
12
nizations.’’ Because USADA does not have search 
13
and seizure or subpoena powers, this cooperation by 
14
Federal agencies is very important to USADA in 
15
carrying out its mission. 
16
(15) Existing criminal statutes, such as con-
17
spiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to com-
18
mit mail fraud, have been important tools used by 
19
United States law enforcement agencies to fight cor-
20
ruption in connection with some Major International 
21
Sport Competitions. However, in other international 
22
sporting events, the facts of a doping fraud con-
23
spiracy may not support the use of existing laws. As 
24
is evident from the recent exposure of the doping 
25

•HR 835 IH
fraud conspiracy in Russia involving the Sochi Olym-
1
pic Games and other Major International Sport 
2
Competitions before and after such Olympic Games, 
3
whistleblowers, including Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov 
4
and Yuliya and Vitaliy Stepanov, can play a critical 
5
role in exposing doping fraud conspiracies and other 
6
fraudulent acts in international sport. 
7
(16) 
These 
whistleblowers, 
including 
Dr. 
8
Grigory 
Rodchenkov 
and 
Yuliya 
and 
Vitaliy 
9
Stepanov, often expose major international doping 
10
fraud conspiracies at considerable personal risk. By 
11
criminalizing these conspiracies, such whistleblowers 
12
will be included under existing witness and inform-
13
ant protection laws.
