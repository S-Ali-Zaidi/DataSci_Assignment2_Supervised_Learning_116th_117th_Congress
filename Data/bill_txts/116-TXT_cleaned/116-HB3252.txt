SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Global Respect Act’’. 
4
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
5
Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) The dignity, freedom, and equality of all 
7
human beings are fundamental to a thriving global 
8
community. 
9
(2) The rights to life, liberty, and security of 
10
the person, the right to privacy, and the right to 
11
freedom of expression and association are funda-
12
mental human rights. 
13
(3) An alarming trend of violence directed at 
14
LGBTI individuals around the world continues. 
15
(4) Approximately one-third of all countries 
16
have laws criminalizing consensual same-sex rela-
17
tions, and many have enacted policies or laws that 
18
would further target LGBTI individuals. 
19
(5) Every year thousands of individuals around 
20
the world are targeted for harassment, attack, ar-
21
rest, and murder on the basis of their sexual ori-
22
entation or gender identity.

•HR 3252 IH
(6) Those who commit crimes against LGBTI 
1
individuals often do so with impunity, and are not 
2
held accountable for their crimes. 
3
(7) Homophobic and transphobic statements by 
4
government officials in many countries in every re-
5
gion of the world promote negative public attitudes 
6
and can lead to violence toward LGBTI individuals. 
7
(8) In many instances police, prison, military, 
8
and civilian government authorities have been di-
9
rectly complicit in abuses aimed at LGBTI citizens, 
10
including arbitrary arrest, torture, and sexual abuse. 
11
(9) Celebrations of LGBTI individuals and 
12
communities, such as film festivals, Pride events, 
13
and demonstrations are often forced underground 
14
due to inaction on the part of, or harassment by, 
15
local law enforcement and government officials, in 
16
violation of freedoms of assembly and expression. 
17
(10) Laws criminalizing consensual same-sex 
18
relations severely hinder access to HIV/AIDS treat-
19
ment, information, and preventive measures for 
20
LGBTI individuals and families. 
21
(11) Many countries are making positive devel-
22
opments in the protection of the basic human rights 
23
of LGBTI individuals.
