SECTION 1. FINDINGS. 
3
Congress makes the following findings: 
4
(1) Congress has the sole power to declare war 
5
under article I, section 8, clause 11 of the United 
6
States Constitution. 
7
(2) Congress has not yet declared war upon, 
8
nor enacted a specific statutory authorization for use

Iran. The 2001 Authorization for Use of Military

Force (Public Law 107–40; 50 U.S.C. 1541 note)

against the perpetrators of the 9/11 attack and the

Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq 
4
Resolution of 2002 (Public Law 107–243; 50 U.S.C. 
5
1541 note) do not serve as a specific statutory au-
6
thorization for war against Iran, and neither author-
7
ize any such action. The Trump Administration has 
8
acknowledged that neither act is specific statutory 
9
authorization for military action against Iran. 
10
(3) President Donald J. Trump understands 
11
that Congress has not authorized war with Iran and 
12
has stated that he has the authority to initiate such 
13
military action without first going to Congress, as 
14
reported in The Hill on June 24, 2019. 
15
(4) The conflict between the United States and 
16
the Islamic Republic of Iran constitutes, within the 
17
meaning of section 4(a) of the War Powers Resolu-
18
tion (50 U.S.C. 1543(a)), either hostilities or a situ-
19
ation where imminent involvement in hostilities is 
20
clearly indicated by the circumstances into which 
21
United States Armed Forces have been introduced. 
22
(5) Section 5(c) of the War Powers Resolution 
23
(50 U.S.C. 1544(c)) states that ‘‘at any time that 
24
United States Armed Forces are engaged in hos-

1
possessions and territories without a declaration of 
2
war or specific statutory authorization, such forces 
3
shall be removed by the President if the Congress so 
4
directs’’. 
5
(6) Section 8(c) of the War Powers Resolution 
6
(50 U.S.C. 1547(c)) defines the introduction of the 
7
United States Armed Forces to include ‘‘the assign-
8
ment of members of such armed forces to command, 
9
coordinate, participate in the movement of, or ac-
10
company the regular or irregular forces of any for-
11
eign country or government when such military 
12
forces are engaged, or there exists an imminent 
13
threat that such forces will become engaged in, hos-
14
tilities’’. 
15
(7) The United States Armed Forces have been 
16
introduced into hostilities, as defined by the War 
17
Powers Resolution, against Iran. 
18
(8) Department of Defense officials have been 
19
warning for more than a year that the Trump Ad-
20
ministration ‘‘maximum pressure campaign’’ against 
21
Iran, which has included economic, diplomatic and 
22
military pressure, is raising the risk of retaliation 
23
against United States troops and personnel. The 
24
cycle of escalating back-and-forth violence between

•HJ 82 IH 
Iran and its proxies and the United States and its 
1
allies have proven their warnings correct. 
2
(9) The question of whether United States 
3
forces should be engaged in armed conflict against 
4
Iran should only be made following a full briefing to 
5
Congress and the American public of the issues at 
6
stake, a public debate in Congress, and a congres-
7
sional vote as contemplated by the Constitution. The 
8
absence of such a deliberative approach is deeply un-
9
fair to members of the United States Armed Forces 
10
and other Americans whose lives are at risk in the 
11
event of hostilities between the United States and 
12
Iran. 
13
(10) Section 1013 of the Department of State 
14
Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1984 and 1985 (50 
15
U.S.C. 1546a) provides that any joint resolution or 
16
bill to require the removal of United States Armed 
17
Forces engaged in hostilities without a declaration of 
18
war or specific statutory authorization shall be con-
19
sidered in accordance with the expedited procedures 
20
of section 601(b) of the International Security and
