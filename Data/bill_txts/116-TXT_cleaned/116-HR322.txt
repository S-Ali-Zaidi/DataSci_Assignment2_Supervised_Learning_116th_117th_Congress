RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the National Association of Letter Carriers one- 
day food drive. 
Whereas the National Association of Letter Carriers (NALC) 
began their one-day food drive in 1992; 
Whereas for many years prior to 1992, a number of NALC 
branches collected food for the needy in the communities 
they served; 
Whereas in 1992, 10 cities were selected to explore a coordi-
nated effort, and a pilot food drive was held in Columbus, 
Ohio, by Branch 78 of the NALC; 
Whereas the pilot food drive was so successful that the food 
drive was then expanded nationwide;

May 15, 1993, with the goal of having at least one 
NALC Branch participate in each of the 50 States;

first national one-day food drive and set a one-day record 
for food collection in the United States by collecting more 
than 11,000,000 pounds of food; 
Whereas in 2018, the NALC collected over 71,600,000 
pounds of food to help restock food banks, pantries, and 
shelters throughout the United States; 
Whereas 2018 marked the 15th consecutive year that the Na-
tion’s largest one-day food drive collected more than 
70,000,000 pounds of food; 
Whereas the NALC one-day food drive has collected more 
than 1,670,000,000 pounds of food since it began in
