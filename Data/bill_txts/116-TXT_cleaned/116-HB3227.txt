•HR 3227 IH
(1) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary of Defense, in 
1
coordination with the Secretary of Homeland Secu-
2
rity, the Secretary of Energy, and the heads of such 
3
other Federal agencies as the Secretary of Defense 
4
considers appropriate, shall carry out a program on 
5
research, development, testing, evaluation, study, 
6
and demonstration of technologies related to blue 
7
carbon capture and direct air capture. 
8
(2) PROGRAM GOALS.—The goals of the pro-
9
gram established under paragraph (1) are as follows: 
10
(A) To develop technologies that capture 
11
carbon dioxide from seawater and the air to 
12
turn such carbon dioxide into clean fuels to en-
13
hance fuel and energy security. 
14
(B) To develop and demonstrate tech-
15
nologies that capture carbon dioxide from sea-
16
water and the air to reuse such carbon dioxide 
17
to create products for military uses. 
18
(C) To develop direct air capture tech-
19
nologies for use— 
20
(i) at military installations or facilities 
21
of the Department of Defense; or 
22
(ii) in modes of transportation by the 
23
Navy or the Coast Guard.
