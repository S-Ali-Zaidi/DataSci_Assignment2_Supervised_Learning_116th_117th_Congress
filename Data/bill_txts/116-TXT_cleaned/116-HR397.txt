Housing Act into law in 1968 which prohibits discrimina-
tion in the sale, rental, or financing of housing based on 
race, color, religion, national origin, sex, familial status, 
and handicap to counter pervasive, systemic, and debili-

Whereas public and private investment and the economic

Housing and Urban Development George Romney began 
working to implement a plan to use the law to its fullest 
effect to reverse past discrimination and institute fair 
housing in a low-key manner; 
Whereas home ownership and stable housing amongst women 
and minorities bring significant economic benefits to com-

crease overall productivity and stimulate wage growth for 
both women and men; 
Whereas a recent study found that increased diversity of 
leadership teams in business resulted in 19 percent high-
er revenue due to innovation, a substantial factor in tech 
companies, startups, and industries of the future; 
Whereas historic and systemic racial barriers to wealth build-
ing and the implication this has had for home ownership 
left many in cities across America vulnerable to displace-
ment and economic isolation; and
