SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
1
It is the sense of Congress that, with respect to the 
2
labor-related provisions of all trade agreements, all parties 
3
to such agreements— 
4
(1) are obliged to ensure all workers in their 
5
territory, regardless of the workers’ citizenship, im-
6
migration status or national origin, the rights and 
7
freedoms guaranteed in the eight core Conventions 
8
of the International Labor Organization, including 
9
the right to strike, as part of the right to freedom 
10
of association; 
11
(2) are obliged to ensure acceptable conditions 
12
of work that cover all workers in their territory, re-
13
gardless of the workers’ citizenship, immigration sta-
14
tus or national origin; 
15
(3) should agree that all workers have the right 
16
to receive wages sufficient for them to afford, in the 
17
region of the signatory country where the worker re-
18
sides, a decent standard of living for the worker and 
19
family; 
20
(4) should agree the work of all workers in the 
21
economy shall be deemed trade-related and therefore 
22
subject to the obligations of this chapter to earn fair 
23
wages; 
24
(5) should agree not to reduce labor standards, 
25
provide formal or informal exceptions to any em-

ployer, or fail to enforce such standards as to any 
1
obligation covered by the agreement; 
2
(6) should agree that a threat, act of intimida-
3
tion, or an act of violence against any worker exer-
4
cising, or attempting to exercise, any of the rights 
5
and freedoms protected by the agreement should be 
6
considered a violation of the underlying right or 
7
freedom; 
8
(7) should agree that the failure to investigate 
9
any such threat, act of intimidation, or act of vio-
10
lence, or failure to prosecute identified perpetrators 
11
of any such threat or act, should be considered a 
12
failure to enforce the underlying right or freedom 
13
and therefore a violation of the agreement; 
14
(8) are obliged to ensure that all trade in goods 
15
made, in whole or in part, by forced labor or the 
16
worst forms of child labor is banned outright and 
17
that no party procures goods made with forced labor 
18
or the worst forms of child labor; 
19

20
appropriate and timely access to tribunals for the 
21
enforcement of the party’s own labor laws, without 
22
undue delay; 
23
(10) are obliged to ensure that domestic laws 
24
and regulations provide for adequate and timely ac-

cess to labor inspectors from government bodies and 
1
unions to seek timely inspections to follow up on al-
2
leged violations of the agreement; 
3
(11) are obliged to ensure that no person wish-
4
ing to be protected by this section is excluded from 
5
such protections by virtue of being classified as a 
6
temporary worker, fixed-contract worker, subcon-
7
tracted worker, independent contractor, or the like; 
8
(12) are obliged to ensure that domestic laws 
9
guard against employer-dominated unions or unions 
10
controlled by political parties, ensuring that unions 
11
are responsible to their members and that unions 
12
provide members with timely access to union bylaws 
13
and collective bargaining agreements; and 
14
(13) are obliged to ensure that workers are en-
15
titled to all rights and benefits of their primary work 
16
location regardless of their citizenship, immigration 
17
status, or national origin, and that adequate effort 
18
are made to ensure that workers are provided with 
19
