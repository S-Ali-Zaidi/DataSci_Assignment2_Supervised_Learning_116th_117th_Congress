A BILL 
To prevent wasteful and abusive billing of ancillary services 
to the Medicare program, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Promoting Integrity 
4
in Medicare Act of 2019’’ or ‘‘PIMA of 2019’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSES. 
6
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Recent studies by the Government Account-
8
ability Office (GAO) examining self-referral practices 
9
02:46 Apr 17, 2019
H2143

•HR 2143 IH
in advanced diagnostic imaging and anatomic pa-
1
thology determined that financial incentives were the 
2
most likely cause of increases in self-referrals. 
3
(2) For advanced diagnostic imaging, GAO 
4
stated that ‘‘providers who self-referred made 
5
400,000 more referrals for advanced imaging serv-
6
ices than they would have if they were not self-refer-
7
ring’’, at a cost of ‘‘more than $100 million’’ in 
8
2010. 
9
(3) For anatomic pathology, GAO found that 
10
‘‘self-referring providers likely referred over 918,000 
11
more anatomic pathology services’’ than they would 
12
have if they were not self-referring, costing Medicare 
13
approximately $69,000,000 more in 2010 than if 
14
self-referral was not permitted. 
15
(4) For radiation oncology, GAO found that in-
16
tensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) utiliza-
17
tion among self-referring groups increased by 356 
18
percent, with overall increases in IMRT utilization 
19
rates and spending due entirely to services per-
20
formed by limited-specialty groups. The GAO con-
21
cluded that ‘‘the higher use of IMRT by self-refer-
22
ring providers results in higher costs for Medicare 
23
and beneficiaries. To the extent that treatment deci-
24
sions are driven by providers’ financial interest and 
25
02:46 Apr 17, 2019
H2143
3 
•HR 2143 IH
not by patient preference, these increased costs are 
1
difficult to justify’’. 
2
(5) For physical therapy, GAO found that ‘‘in 
3
the year a provider began to self-refer, physical ther-
4
apy service referrals increased at a higher rate rel-
5
ative to non-self-referring providers of the same spe-
6
cialty’’. 
7
(6) Noting the rapid growth of services covered 
8
by the in-office ancillary services (IOAS) exception 
9
and evidence that these services are sometimes fur-
10
nished inappropriately by referring physicians, the 
11
Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) 
12
stated that physician self-referral of ancillary serv-
13
ices creates incentives to increase volume under 
14
Medicare’s current fee-for-service payment systems 
15
and the rapid volume growth contributes to Medi-
16
care’s rising financial burden on taxpayers and bene-
17
ficiaries. 
18
(7) The President’s Fiscal Year 2017 Budget 
19
includes the change to remove the four services: ad-
20
vanced diagnostic imaging, anatomic pathology, radi-
21
ation oncology, and physical therapy from the IOAS 
22
exception to the Stark Law and cited the change as 
23
generating a savings score of $4,980,000,000 over 
24
10 years. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Of-
25
02:46 Apr 17, 2019
H2143
4 
•HR 2143 IH
fice’s analysis of the President’s Fiscal Year 2017 
1
Budget listed the change as generating a savings of 
2
$3,300,000,000 over 10 years. 
3
(8) According to the Centers for Medicare & 
4
Medicaid Services, a key rationale for the IOAS ex-
5
ception was to permit physicians to provide ancillary 
6
services in their offices to better inform diagnosis 
7
and treatment decisions at the time of the patient’s 
8
initial office visit. 
9
(9) It is necessary, therefore, to distinguish be-
10
tween services and procedures that were intended to 
11
be covered by the IOAS exception, such as routine 
12
clinical laboratory services or simple x-rays that are 
13
provided during the patient’s initial office visit, and 
14
other health care services which were clearly not en-
15
visioned to be covered by that exception because they 
16
cannot be performed or completed during the pa-
17
tient’s initial office visit. 
18
(10) According to a 2010 Health Affairs study, 
19
less than 10 percent of CT, MRI, and Nuclear Medi-
20
cine scans take place on the same day as the initial 
21
patient office visit. 
22
(11) According to a 2012 Health Affairs study, 
23
urologists’ self-referrals for anatomic pathology serv-
24
ices of biopsy specimens is linked to increased use 
25
02:46 Apr 17, 2019
H2143

•HR 2143 IH
and volume billed along with a lower detection of 
1
prostate cancer. 
2
(12) According to an October 2011 Laboratory 
3
Economics report, there has been an increase in the 
4
number of anatomic pathology specimen units billed 
5
to the Medicare part B program from 2006 through 
6
2010, specifically for CPT Code 88305, and the rate 
7
of increase billed by physician offices for this service 
8
is accelerating at a far greater pace than the rest of 
9
the provider segments. 
10
(13) According to a 2013 American Academy of 
11
Dermatology Pathology Billing paper, arrangements 
12
involving the split of the technical and professional 
13
components of anatomic pathology services among 
14
different providers may endanger patient safety and 
15
undermine quality of care. 
16
(14) In November 2012, Bloomberg News re-
17
leased an investigative report that scrutinized or-
18
deals faced by California prostate cancer patients 
19
treated by a urology clinic that owns radiation ther-
20
apy equipment. The report found that physician self- 
21
referral resulted in a detrimental impact on patient 
22
care and drove up health care costs in the Medicare 
23
program. The Wall Street Journal, the Washington 
24
Post, and the Baltimore Sun have also published in-
25
02:46 Apr 17, 2019
H2143
6 
•HR 2143 IH
vestigations showing that urology groups owning ra-
1
diation therapy machines have utilization rates that 
2
rise quickly and are well above national norms for 
3
radiation therapy treatment of prostate cancer. 
4
(15) According to a 2010 MedPAC report, only 
5
3 percent of outpatient physical therapy services 
6
were provided on the same day as an office visit, 
7
only 9 percent within 7 days of an office visit, and 
8
only 14 percent within 14 days of an office visit. 
9
These services are not integral to the physician’s ini-
10
tial diagnosis and do not improve patient conven-
11
ience because patients must return for physical ther-
12
apy treatments. 
13
(16) In an April 2018, European Urology arti-
14
cle authored by leading urologists about Medicare 
15
beneficiaries with prostate cancer diagnoses, re-
16
searchers found, ‘‘Urologists practicing in single-spe-
17
cialty groups with an ownership interest in radiation 
18
therapy are more likely to treat men with prostate 
19
cancer, including those with a high risk of noncancer 
20
mortality.’’. This suggests that urologists practicing 
21
in single-specialty groups with an ownership interest 
22
in radiation therapy are more likely to treat, and 
23
even potentially overtreat, patients with IMRT than 
24
02:46 Apr 17, 2019
H2143
7 
•HR 2143 IH
those affiliated with a multispecialty practice or a 
1
group without an ownership stake. 
2
(17) In a January 2019, JAMA Oncology arti-
3
cle, authors systematically reviewed 18 studies to as-
4
sess physicians’ response to reimbursement incen-
5
tives on cancer care delivery across various clinical 
6
settings. Across the studies, the authors consistently 
7
found that ‘‘the ability to self-refer for radiation on-
8
cology services was associated with increased use of 
9
radiation therapy’’. 
10
(18) Those services intended to be covered 
11
under the IOAS exception are not affected by this 
12
legislation. 
13
(19) The exception to the ownership or invest-
14
ment prohibition for rural providers in the ‘‘Stark’’ 
15
rule is not affected by this legislation. 
16
(b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this Act are the fol-
17
lowing: 
18
(1) Maintain the in-office ancillary services ex-
19
ception and preserve its original intent by removing 
20
certain complex services from the exception—specifi-
21
cally, advanced imaging, anatomic pathology, radi-
22
ation therapy, and physical therapy. 
23
(2) Protect patients from misaligned provider 
24
financial incentives.

(3) Protect Medicare resources by saving bil-
1
lions of dollars. 
2
(4) Accomplish the purposes described in para-
3
graphs (1), (2), and (3) in a manner that does not 
4
alter the existing exception to the ownership or in-
5
vestment prohibition for rural providers.
