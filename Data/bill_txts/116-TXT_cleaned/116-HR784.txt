RESOLUTION 
Condemning and censuring Nancy D’Alessandro Pelosi, 
Representative of California’s 12th Congressional District. 
Whereas the power of impeachment is divided under article 
I, section 2, clause 5 and article I, section 3, clause 6 of 
the Constitution into two parts with the House having 
the sole Power of Impeachment and the Senate having 
the sole Power to try impeachments; 
Whereas on December 18, 2019, the House of Representa-
tives agreed to two articles of impeachment against Don-
ald John Trump, President of the United States, for high 
crimes and misdemeanors; 
Whereas historical precedent of the House indicates that fol-
lowing adoption of such articles, the House should forth-

with name managers to prosecute the House’s case before 
the Senate and notify the Senate of such appointments; 
Whereas failure to name managers and inform the Senate of 
their appointment impedes the Senate from proceeding 
with its constitutional duty to try an impeachment under 
its rules; 
Whereas the sole role of the House in an impeachment trial 
of the Senate is to present evidence in the manner pre-
scribed by the rules of the Senate; 
Whereas Representative Nancy D’Alessandro Pelosi in her 
capacity as Speaker of the House is preventing the 
House from naming managers in an attempt to extort 
concessions from the Senate on the conduct of the im-
peachment trial against President Donald John Trump; 
Whereas this attempt by Representative Nancy D’Alessandro 
Pelosi to establish a quid pro quo where the House per-
forms a necessary function in the impeachment process 
in exchange for the Senate agreeing to demands with re-
spect to the impeachment trial is an impermissible at-
tempt to invade the Constitutionally delegated authority 
of the Senate; 
Whereas leveraging the powers of the House in this matter 
by indefinitely preventing the trial of Donald John 
Trump or by attempting to slant the trial in a manner 
favorable to the proponents of impeachment and removal 
threatens to deny Donald John Trump his constitu-
tionally protected right of due process and the oppor-
tunity to defend himself; and 
Whereas the actions of Representative Nancy D’Alessandro 
Pelosi represent an abuse of power and bring dishonor
