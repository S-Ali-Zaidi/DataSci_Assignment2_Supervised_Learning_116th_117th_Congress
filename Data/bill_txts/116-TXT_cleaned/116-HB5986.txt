fuel-dependent communities, and other vulnerable 
1
populations, such as persons with disabilities, chil-
2
dren, and the elderly, are disproportionately bur-
3
dened by environmental hazards that include expo-
4
sure to polluted air, waterways, and landscapes. 
5
(2) Environmental justice disparities are also 
6
exhibited through a lack of equitable access to green 
7
spaces, public recreation opportunities, and informa-
8
tion and data on potential exposure to environmental 
9
hazards. 
10
(3) Communities experiencing environmental in-
11
justice have been subjected to systemic racial, social, 
12
and economic injustices and face a disproportionate 
13
burden of adverse human health or environmental 
14
effects, a higher risk of intentional, unconscious, and 
15
structural discrimination, and disproportionate en-
16
ergy burdens. 
17
(4) Environmental justice communities have 
18
been made more vulnerable to the effects of climate 
19
change due to a combination of factors, particularly 
20
the legacy of segregation and historically racist zon-
21
ing codes, and often have the least resources to re-
22
spond, making it a necessity for environmental jus-
23
tice communities to be meaningfully engaged as

partners and stakeholders in government decision- 
1
making as our nation builds its climate resilience. 
2
(5) Potential environmental and climate threats 
3
to environmental justice communities merit a higher 
4
level of engagement, review, and consent to ensure 
5
that communities are not forced to bear dispropor-
6
tionate environmental and health impacts. 
7
(6) The burden of proof that a proposed action 
8
will not harm communities, including through cumu-
9
lative exposure effects, should fall on polluting in-
10
dustries and on the Federal Government in its regu-
11
latory role, not the communities themselves. 
12
(7) Executive Order 12898 (59 Fed. Reg. 32, 
13
relating to Federal Actions To Address Environ-
14
mental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-In-
15
come Populations) directs Federal agencies to ad-
16
dress disproportionately high and adverse human 
17
health or environmental effects of its programs, but 
18
Federal agencies have been inconsistent in updating 
19
their strategic plans for environmental justice and 
20
reporting on their progress in enacting these plans. 
21
(8) Government action to correct environmental 
22
injustices is a moral imperative. Federal policy can 
23
and should improve public health and improve the 
24
overall well-being of all communities.

(9) All people have the right to breathe clean 
1
air, drink clean water, live free of dangerous levels 
2
of toxic pollution, and share the benefits of a pros-
3
perous and vibrant pollution-free economy. 
4
(10) A fair and just transition to a pollution- 
5
free economy is necessary to ensure that workers 
6
and communities in deindustrialized areas have ac-
7
cess to the resources and benefits of a sustainable 
8
future. This transition must also address the eco-
9
nomic disparities experienced by residents living in 
10
areas contaminated by pollution or environmental 
11
degradation, including access to jobs, and members 
12
of those communities must be fully and meaningfully 
13
involved in transition planning processes. 
14
(11) It is the responsibility of the Federal Gov-
15
ernment to seek to achieve environmental justice, 
16
health equity, and climate justice for all commu-
17
nities.

(3) provide direct guidance and technical assist-
8
ance to communities experiencing environmental in-

of the science, laws, regulations, and policy related 
11
to Federal agency action on environmental justice 
12
issues; 
13
(4) cooperate with State governments, Tribal

15
lution and public health burdens in communities ex-
16
periencing 
environmental 
injustice, 
and 
build
