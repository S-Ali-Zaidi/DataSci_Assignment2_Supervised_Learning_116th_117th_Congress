and his concerns about the call, which he reported to his 
superiors; 
Whereas at the hearing, Lieutenant Colonel Alexander 
Vindman said ‘‘I am a patriot, and it is my sacred duty 
and honor to advance and defend our country, irrespec-

Whereas Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman and his twin 
brother, Lieutenant Colonel Yevgeny Vindman, were re-
moved from the National Security Council on February

should seek to preserve the political neutrality of the 
Federal Government; and

the unwarranted and politically motivated termination of 
two qualified, distinguished, and dedicated public serv-
ants has no place in a Nation ruled by laws: Now, there-
