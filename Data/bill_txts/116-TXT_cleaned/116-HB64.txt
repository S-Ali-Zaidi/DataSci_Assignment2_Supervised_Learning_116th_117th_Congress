tial clinical benefit to patients, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

and other adverse health conditions;

(2) promote research and human clinical trials 
1
using stem cells that are ethically obtained and show 
2
evidence of providing clinical benefit for human pa-
3
tients; and 
4
(3) promote the derivation of pluripotent stem 
5
cell lines without the creation of human embryos for 
6
research purposes and without the destruction or 
7
discarding of, or risk of injury to, a human embryo.

(a) AUTHORIZATION.—Part B of title IV of the Pub-
10
lic Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 284 et seq.) is amended 
11
by inserting after section 409J the following: 
12
‘‘SEC. 409K. HUMAN STEM CELL RESEARCH AND THERAPY.

‘‘(a) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary shall conduct and 
14
support basic and applied research to develop techniques 
15
for the isolation, derivation, production, testing, and 
16
human clinical use of stem cells that may result in im-
17
proved understanding of or treatments for diseases and 
18
other adverse health conditions, including pluripotent stem 
19
cells that have the flexibility of embryonic stem cells 
20
(whether or not such pluripotent stem cells have an embry-
21
onic source), prioritizing research with the greatest poten-
22
tial for near-term clinical benefit in human patients, pro-
23
vided that such isolation, derivation, production, testing, 
24
or use will not involve—

‘‘(1) the creation of a human embryo for re-

search purposes;

‘‘(2) the destruction of or discarding of, or risk

of injury to, a living human embryo; or

‘‘(3) the use of any stem cell, the derivation or

provision of which would be inconsistent with the 
6
standards established in paragraph (1) or (2).

‘‘(b) GUIDELINES.—Not later than 90 days after the 
8
date of the enactment of this section, the Secretary, after 
9
consultation with the Director of NIH, shall issue final 
10
guidelines implementing subsection (a) to ensure that any 
11
research (including any clinical trial) supported under 
12
subsection (a)— 
13
‘‘(1) is clearly consistent with the standards es-
14
tablished in subsection (a) if conducted using human 
15
cells, as demonstrated by animal trials or other sub-
16
stantial evidence; and 
17
‘‘(2) is prioritized in terms of potential for 
18
near-term clinical benefit in human patients, as indi-
19
cated by substantial evidence from basic research or 
20
by substantial clinical evidence which may include 
21
but is not limited to— 
22
‘‘(A) evidence of improvement in one or 
23
more human patients suffering from illness or 
24
injury, as documented in reports by professional

‘‘(c) DEFINITIONS.—In this section: 
5
‘‘(1) HUMAN EMBRYO.—The term ‘human em-
6
bryo’ includes any organism, not protected as a 
7
human subject under part 46 of title 45, Code of 
8
Federal Regulations, as of the date of the enactment 
9
of this section, that is derived by fertilization, par-
10
thenogenesis, cloning, or any other means from one 
11
or more human gametes or human diploid cells. 
12
‘‘(2) RISK OF INJURY.—The term ‘risk of in-
13
jury’ means subjecting a human embryo to risk of 
14
injury or death greater than that allowed for re-
15
search on fetuses in utero under section 46.204(b) 
16
of title 45, Code of Federal Regulations (or any suc-
17
cessor regulation), or section 498(b) of this Act.’’.

19
the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 289a) is amend-
20
ed by adding at the end the following: 
21
‘‘(d)(1) With respect to human stem cell research, the 
22
Secretary, acting through the Director of NIH, shall give 
23
priority to conducting or supporting research in accord-
24

‘‘(2) At the end of fiscal year 2020 and each subse-

quent fiscal year, the Secretary shall submit to the Con-
2
gress a report outlining the number of research proposals 
3
under section 409K that were peer reviewed, a summary 
4
and detailed list of all such research proposals that were 
5
not funded, and an explanation of why the proposals did 
6
not merit funding. The reports under this paragraph shall 
7
be in addition to the reporting on stem cell research in-
8
cluded in the biennial report required by section 403.’’.

(c) BIENNIAL REPORTS.—Section 403(a)(5) of the 
10
Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 283(a)(5)) is
