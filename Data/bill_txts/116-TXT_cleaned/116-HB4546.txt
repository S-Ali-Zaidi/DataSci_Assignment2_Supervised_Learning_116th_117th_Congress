To authorize additional monies to the Public Housing Capital 
Fund of the Department of Housing and Urban Develop-
ment, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

The Congress finds the following:

(1) Housing is a foundational determinant of 
1
health and has been recognized as such since the 
2
early days of public health. 
3
(2) Poor housing conditions contribute to a 
4
broad range of infectious diseases, chronic diseases, 
5
injuries, childhood development complications, nutri-
6
tion issues, and mental health challenges. 
7
(3) The United States Housing Act of 1937 
8
(Public Law 75–412) charges the Department of 
9
Housing and Urban Development (HUD) with pro-
10
viding residents with a decent, safe, and affordable 
11
place to live, including those that live in public hous-
12
ing. 
13
(4) While public housing is a federally created 
14
program overseen by HUD, the properties are owned 
15
and managed at the local level by quasi-govern-
16
mental public housing authorities under contract 
17
with the Federal Government. 
18
(5) Thus, the public housing program is gov-
19
erned in part by Federal rules and regulations and 
20
in part by policies enacted at the local level. 
21
(6) Passage of the United States Housing Act 
22
of 1937 sought to address the needs of low-income 
23
people through public housing. At the time of pas-
24
sage of such Act, the Nation’s housing stock was of

very poor quality. Public housing was a significant 
1
improvement for those who had access to it. 
2
(7) However, over the years the living condi-
3
tions in public housing began to deteriorate as the 
4
operational needs of the units and costs necessary to 
5
remedy major capital deficiencies began to outpace 
6
the level of funding provided by the Federal Govern-
7
ment and the residents’ rent contributions. 
8
(8) By 1990, no significant investment in hous-
9
ing affordable to the lowest-income individuals had 
10
been made by the Federal Government in more than 
11
30 years. 
12
(9) In 1998, the enactment of the Quality 
13
Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998 (title 
14
V of Public Law 105–276) prohibited public housing 
15
authorities from using any Federal capital funding 
16
or operating funding to develop net new housing. 
17
(10) More than a decade after the enactment of 
18
the Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 
19
1998, the number of public housing units nationally 
20
began to steadily decline, as more units were torn 
21
down than rebuilt. 
22
(11) With the exception of an infusion of fund-
23
ing from the economic stimulus legislation in 2009— 
24
the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (Pub-
25

•HR 4546 IH
lic Law 111–5)—Federal capital funding has re-
1
mained relatively level for more than a decade, de-
2
spite an increasing backlog in unmet capital needs. 
3
(12) Today, there are approximately 1.2 million 
4
units of public housing across the country receiving 
5
Federal funding. The Nation’s largest public housing 
6
authority, the New York City Public Housing Au-
7
thority, houses approximately 380,000 residents in 
8
316 developments across New York City. 
9
(13) As of April 2019, the national public hous-
10
ing capital repair backlog stood at more than $70 
11
billion. 
12
(14) In his Budget Request for fiscal year 2020 
13
for the Department of Housing and Urban Develop-
14
ment, President Donald Trump requested $0 for the 
15
Department’s Public Housing Capital Fund, which 
16
continues to be the primary source of funding public 
17
housing authorities rely on to address necessary in-
18
frastructure upgrades and repairs. 
19
(15) Federal disinvestment in public housing 
20
has forced many residents to live in accelerating sub-
21
standard living. For example, the New York City 
22
Housing Authority has a capital repair backlog of 
23
approximately $32 billion. New York City Housing 
24
Authority residents suffer from a consistent lack of

hot water, insufficient heat during the winter 
1
months, rodent and insect infestations, broken ele-
2
vators, and widespread and recurring lead and mold 
3
problems. 
4
(16) Substandard housing conditions, such as 
5
poor ventilation, pest infestations, and water leaks, 
6
are directly associated with the development and ex-
7
acerbation of respiratory diseases like asthma. 
8
(17) The Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
9
vention has made clear that no level of lead poi-
10
soning is safe. Lead poisoning can result in irrevers-
11
ible brain damage and affects every major bodily 
12
system. At high levels, lead poisoning can cause ane-
13
mia, multi-organ damage, seizures, coma, and death 
14
in children. Even with the lowest levels of lead expo-
15
sure, children experience physical, cognitive, and 
16
neurobehavioral impairment as well as lower IQ lev-
17
els, lower class standing in high school, greater ab-
18
senteeism, lower vocabulary and grammatical-rea-
19
soning scores, and poorer hand-eye coordination rel-
20
ative to other children. 
21
(18) Exposure to cold indoor temperatures is 
22
associated with increased risk of cardiovascular dis-
23
ease.

(19) Due to its aging infrastructure, the living 
1
conditions in public housing are causing severe 
2
health consequences for public housing residents 
3
throughout the Nation, including asthma, res-
4
piratory illness, and elevated blood lead levels. 
5
(20) This is a fixable public health crisis. Fed-
6
eral disinvestment in public housing has con-
7
sequences and aging infrastructure is, in many 
8
cases, the root cause of many of these health issues 
9
for residents. 
10
(21) For example, one leading study found that 
11
children living in public housing have higher odds of 
12
asthma than children living in all types of private 
13
housing, even after adjusting for individual risk fac-
14
tors such as minority ethnicity and race, living in a 
15
low-income household, and living in a low-income 
16
community. 
17
(22) Therefore, it is necessary to reinvest in 
18
public housing, provide the money needed to fulfill 
19
outstanding capital needs, and to again ensure that 
20
all Americans have a decent home and suitable living 
21
environment, as is HUD’s charge.
