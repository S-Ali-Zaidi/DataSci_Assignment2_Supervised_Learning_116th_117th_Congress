(1) A small number of chronic diseases account 
1
for the majority of health care spending in the 
2
United States. 
3
(2) Limited and targeted interventions for 
4
many chronic diseases prevent the need for addi-
5
tional, more costly therapies associated with un-
6
treated or unmanaged chronic diseases that lead to 
7
adverse effects on quality of life for patients. 
8
(3) These types of chronic care preventive serv-
9
ices should be encouraged to maximize the effective-
10
ness and positive outcomes of the care provided 
11
under high-deductible health plans. 
12
(4) Section 223(c)(2)(C) of the Internal Rev-
13
enue Code of 1986 explicitly grants the Secretary of 
14
the Treasury flexibility in defining the scope of pre-
15
ventive care for purposes of the preventive care safe 
16
harbor. As of the date of introduction of this Act, 
17
the Secretary of the Treasury has refrained from ex-
18
ercising existing authority under such section to ex-
19
pand the preventive care safe harbor to include 
20
chronic disease prevention. 
21
(5) In the absence of an expansion of the pre-
22
ventive care safe harbor by the Secretary of the 
23
Treasury, the Chronic Disease Management Act of 
24
2019 would expressly permit high-deductible health

plans to provide chronic disease prevention and 
1
treatment, subject to certain limitations, prior to a

plan enrollee having met their plan deductible. 
3
(6) Allowing health savings account-eligible 
4
high-deductible health plans to cover chronic disease 
5
prevention and treatment on a pre-deductible basis 
6
promotes the concept of Value-Based Insurance De-
7
sign, which is an effective tool to improve the quality 
8
and reduce the cost of care for Americans with 
9
chronic diseases, with improved outcomes via in-
10
creased medication adherence, reduced complica-
11
tions, and decreased emergency department visits.

23
termined by the Assistant Secretary for Health
