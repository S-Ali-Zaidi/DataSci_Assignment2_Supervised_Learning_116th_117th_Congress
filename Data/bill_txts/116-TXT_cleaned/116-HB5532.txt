(2) The America COMPETES Reauthorization 
1
Act granted authority for Federal agencies to carry 
2
out prize competitions in order to stimulate innova-
3
tion to advance each agency’s mission. 
4
(3) Prize competitions provide a benefit to the 
5
American people by providing a high reward return 
6
on taxpayer dollars. 
7
(4) Since 2010, Federal agencies have con-
8
ducted nearly 1,000 prize competitions to help ad-
9
dress some of our Nation’s greatest challenges. 
10
(5) Prize competitions at the National Science 
11
Foundation have helped to spark further research on 
12
important and emerging topics within data science, 
13
engineering, astrophysics, biology, and other areas. 
14
(6) Artificial Intelligence and machine learning 
15
(AI/ML) are rapidly being developed for deployment 
16
across all sectors creating a demand for new innova-
17
tion from researchers and developers in order to ad-
18
dress technological and social challenges from AI/ 
19
ML. 
20
(7) AI/ML technologies are currently being 
21
used to create sophisticated deep fake videos, im-
22
ages, and audio, digital content that is manipulated 
23
in order to spread false information which can lead

to a degradation of public trust and national secu-
1
rity concerns. 
2
(8) As deep fake technology continues to ad-
3
vance, its detection will become increasingly difficult 
4
without new tools for digital forensics. 
5
(9) Although other Federal agencies are cur-
6
rently involved in supporting and conducting re-
7
search into deep fake detection technology in the 
8
context of national security, research spurred by 
9
prize competitions at the National Science Founda-
10
tion can have broader benefits for the American 
11
public. 
12
SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF PRIZE COMPETITION. 
13
The Director of the National Science Foundation 
14
shall carry out prize competitions pursuant to section 24 
15
of the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 
16
1980 (15 U.S.C. 3719) to incentivize research into tech-
17
nology that advances detection of deep fake audio, images, 
18
and video. The Director shall consider conducting subse-
19
quent or recurring competitions to account for changing 
20
and advancing technologies.
