RESOLUTION 
Supporting the goals and ideals of National Black HIV/ 
AIDS Awareness Day. 
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) estimates that in the United States more than 
1,100,000 people are living with HIV, and 15 percent do 
not know they are infected; 
Whereas in 2017, approximately 38,739 people were diag-
nosed with HIV in the United States; 
Whereas since the beginning of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in 
the United States, racial and ethnic minorities have been 
disproportionately affected by the disease; 
Whereas African Americans are diagnosed with AIDS later 
than their White counterparts, are confronted with great-

er barriers in accessing care and treatment, and face 
higher morbidity and mortality outcomes; 
Whereas African Americans account for nearly half of all 
those with AIDS who have died in the United States 
since the beginning of the epidemic; 
Whereas in 2015, 3,379 African Americans died of HIV or 
AIDS, accounting for 52 percent of total deaths attrib-
uted to the disease that year; 
Whereas in 2014, HIV/AIDS was the 6th leading cause of 
death for Black men overall and for Black women ages 
25–34, and the 5th for Black men ages 35–44 and 4th 
for Black women ages 35–44 in 2014, ranking higher 
than their respective counterparts in any other racial/eth-
nic group; 
Whereas in 2016, African Americans represented 44 percent 
of all people living with HIV in the United States, despite 
comprising just 12 percent of the United States popu-
lation; 
Whereas in 2016, over 17,000 African Americans were diag-
nosed with HIV; 
Whereas African-American gay and bisexual men are more 
affected by HIV than any other group in the United 
States, accounting for a higher proportion of HIV diag-
noses, those living with HIV, those ever diagnosed with 
AIDS, and HIV/AIDS-related deaths; 
Whereas in 2016, more than half of African Americans diag-
nosed with HIV were gay or bisexual men; 
Whereas in 2016, among all gay and bisexual men who had 
received an HIV diagnosis, African Americans accounted 
for the highest number (38 percent);

•HRES 111 IH 
Whereas according to a 2016 study by the CDC, an esti-
mated half of Black gay men will be diagnosed with HIV 
in their lifetime, if current HIV diagnoses rates persist; 
Whereas homophobia, stigma, and discrimination pose major 
obstacles to HIV testing, treatment and other prevention 
services for gay and bisexual African-American men; 
Whereas among all women diagnosed with HIV in 2016, 61 
percent were African American, despite comprising only 
14 percent of the female population in the United States; 
Whereas African-American women face the highest risk of 
HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) 
compared with women of other groups; 
Whereas the HIV diagnosis rate for African-American women 
remains 16 times as high as that of White women, and 
almost five times that of Hispanic women; 
Whereas among African-American women, the leading trans-
mission category of HIV infection is heterosexual contact, 
followed by intravenous drug use; 
Whereas research indicates that the high incarceration rates 
of Black men may contribute to the disproportionate 
rates of HIV infections among Black women; 
Whereas in 2010—the most recent data available—there 
were more than 20,000 inmates with HIV/AIDS in State 
and Federal prisons, a prevalence that is 4 times the rate 
of HIV in the general population; 
Whereas among incarcerated populations, African-American 
men are 5 times as likely as White men, and twice as 
likely as Hispanic/Latino men, to be diagnosed with HIV;

•HRES 111 IH 
Whereas among incarcerated populations, African-American 
women are more than twice as likely to be diagnosed with 
HIV as White or Hispanic/Latino women; 
Whereas transgender women in the United States are at high 
risk for HIV; 
Whereas more than half of all transgender people diagnosed 
with HIV are Black or African American; 
Whereas the Southern United States now experiences the 
highest burden of the HIV/AIDS epidemic; 
Whereas in 2017, the South made up 52 percent of the new 
HIV diagnoses in the United States; 
Whereas African Americans are severely and disproportion-
ately affected by HIV in the South, accounting for 53 
percent of all new HIV infections in the region; 
Whereas socioeconomic issues impact the rates of HIV infec-
tion among African Americans in the South and through-
out the United States; 
Whereas socioeconomic factors like income inequality, pov-
erty, and lack of access to HIV prevention education and 
basic 
health 
services, 
and 
cultural 
factors 
like 
homophobia, transphobia, and racism all pose significant 
challenges to combating the HIV/AIDS epidemic; 
Whereas we are seeing signs of progress; 
Whereas from 2011 to 2015, HIV diagnoses among African- 
American women fell by nearly 20 percent and have also 
fallen sharply among African Americans who inject 
drugs; 
Whereas testing, education, counseling, and harm reduction 
practices are all critical to prevent HIV;

Whereas life-saving treatment is also a proven prevention 
tool, and research shows that antiretroviral drugs can re-
duce the amount of virus to undetectable levels (also 
known as viral suppression), effectively resulting in no 
risk of transmission of HIV; 
Whereas in 2012, the Food and Drug Administration ap-
proved pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) as prevention 
for people who are HIV-negative; 
Whereas PrEP can reduce the risk of HIV infection for HIV- 
negative people by up to 99 percent; 
Whereas in 1998, Congress and the Clinton administration 
created the National Minority AIDS Initiative to help co-
ordinate funding, build capacity, and provide prevention, 
care, and treatment services within the African-American, 
Hispanic, Asian Pacific Islander, and Native American 
communities; 
Whereas the National Minority AIDS Initiative assists with 
leadership development of community-based organizations 
(CBOs), establishes and links provider networks, builds 
community prevention infrastructure, promotes technical 
assistance among CBOs, and raises awareness among Af-
rican-American communities; 
Whereas 2019 marks the twenty-first year of the National 
Minority AIDS Initiative which has successfully estab-
lished life-saving services and programs to address the 
needs of those communities, families, and individuals 
most impacted and burdened HIV; 
Whereas in 2010, the Obama administration unveiled the 
first National HIV/AIDS Strategy, which identified a set 
of priorities and strategic action steps tied to measurable

outcomes for moving the Nation forward in addressing 
the domestic HIV epidemic; 
Whereas in 2013, the National Association for the Advance-
ment of Colored People (NAACP) released a manual of 
best practices for faith leaders to mobilize communities, 
advocate for community support for people infected with 
and affected by HIV/AIDS, and organize dialogues on 
HIV/AIDS as a social justice issue as part of ‘‘The Black 
Church and HIV: The Social Justice Imperative’’; 
Whereas in July 2015, the ‘‘National HIV/AIDS Strategy for 
the United States: Updated to 2020’’ was released and 
included actions and goals in order to reduce HIV-related 
disparities and inequalities; 
Whereas the Affordable Care Act’s expansion of Medicaid 
and reforms to the individual insurance market have 
helped lower the uninsured rates for nonelderly African 
Americans by more than one-third between 2013 and 
2016, leading to better health outcomes for African 
Americans living with or at risk of HIV; 
Whereas National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day was 
founded by 5 national organizations in 1999 to provide 
capacity-building assistance to Black communities and 
organizations; and 
Whereas each year on February 7, individuals, organizations, 
and policy makers across the Nation participate in Na-
tional Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day to promote HIV 
education, testing, community involvement, and treat-
ment in Black communities: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
