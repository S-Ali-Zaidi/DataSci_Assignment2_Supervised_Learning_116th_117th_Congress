RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
there is a need to rebuild the Navy and ensure that 
it is prepared to engage with adversaries around the 
world through an increased investment in the United 
States naval power. 
Whereas the United States naval buildup completed prior to 
World War II was quintessential to the success of the 
Nation and its allies and ensured victory in that and sub-
sequent wars; 
Whereas the Navy has too few platforms to wage warfare in 
the 21st century against a myriad of potential adver-
saries;

Whereas adversaries of the United States are increasing the 
sizes of their fleets and building their anti-ship capabili-
ties; 
Whereas the United States must build up the Navy in prepa-
ration for this threat; 
Whereas the United States is a maritime nation and must 
maintain a Navy that is capable of deterring and, if nec-
essary, waging war against nation states and non-state 
actors alike with overwhelming force in a swift and deci-
sive manner; 
Whereas the fleet is not sufficiently sized to deter adversaries 
while maintaining continuous presence in contentious re-
gions with deployments of naval forces in regions where 
the United States has demonstrated national interests; 
Whereas readiness concerns that would preclude successful 
engagements against enemies on multiple fronts is unac-
ceptable in today’s global threat environment; 
Whereas given the large forward deployed surface force re-
quirement at any given moment, there is not sufficient 
time for the fleet to address training and material readi-
ness challenges with the current fleet size; 
Whereas the threat the United States faces is growing and 
evolving; 
Whereas China is investing heavily in a naval buildup, and 
President Xi Jinping expects China to be a global power 
by 2050 and is attempting to construct a military to sur-
pass as the United States; 
Whereas since 2016, the Navy has had 18 unsafe or unpro-
fessional encounters with Chinese military forces in the 
Pacific;

Whereas Russia is also actively modernizing its fleet and in-
creasing military activity in the Arctic; 
Whereas Iran is demonstrating an increase in activity in the 
Arabian Gulf, Strait of Hormuz, and Gulf of Oman with 
no indication of de-escalation; 
Whereas the United States is the primary protector of inter-
national freedom of navigation laws, which necessitates 
persistent presence in the contested waters of the South 
China Sea, operations to limit piracy off the Horn of Af-
rica, and abiding demonstrations of interest to ensure 
safe commercial transport throughout the world; 
Whereas in response to natural disasters in the United States 
and abroad, the Navy provides crucial support to prevent 
the loss of life and support recovery efforts; and 
Whereas the advantages of maintaining the capability to for-
ward operate around the world is critical to maintaining 
flexibility and agility in today’s evolving battle space: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—

(1) recognizes the need for the Navy to increase

its long-term capabilities and recommends the fol-

lowing force structure by the year 2050—

to be commensurate to the threat, therefore constant
