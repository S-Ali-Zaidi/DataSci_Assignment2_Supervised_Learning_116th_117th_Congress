RESOLUTION 
Expressing concern regarding the prevalence of hexavalent 
chromium in drinking water in the United States. 
Whereas hexavalent chromium, also referred to as chromium- 
6, was found at elevated levels in the drinking water 
sources of over 200,000,000 Americans in all 50 States; 
Whereas in 2008, the National Toxicology Program found 
that ingestion of hexavalent chromium was shown to 
cause increased incidences of cancer in laboratory rats 
and mice; 
Whereas in 2010, the California Office of Environmental 
Health Hazard Assessment set a public health goal for 
hexavalent chromium of 0.02 parts per billion in drinking 
water;

Whereas in 2010, New Jersey’s Drinking Water Quality In-
stitute drafted a health-based maximum contaminant 
level for hexavalent chromium of 0.07 parts per billion in 
drinking water; 
Whereas in 2016, the North Carolina Department of Health 
and Human Services established a health based screening 
level for hexavalent chromium of 0.07 parts per billion in 
drinking water; 
Whereas between 2014 and 2016, the levels of hexavalent 
chromium in test results collected by the Environmental 
Protection Agency for the zip code 77099 contained areas 
that exceeded 6.0 parts per billion based on analysis from 
the Environmental Working Group, one of the leading en-
vironmental research organizations in the United States; 
Whereas the Environmental Protection Agency is in the proc-
ess of drafting a toxicological review of acceptable levels 
of hexavalent chromium found in drinking water; and 
Whereas all Americans deserve access to clean drinking 
water: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) recognizes the importance of protecting the 
2
American people from drinking water polluted with 
3
carcinogens; 
4
(2) encourages State and local governments to 
5
collaborate and set reasonable standards for hexava-
6
lent chromium in drinking water to ensure the safety 
7
of their constituents; 
8
(3) encourages the Environmental Protection 
9
Agency to complete their health review and establish

standards for hexavalent chromium found in drink-

ing water; 
2
(4) encourages consideration of a tax break for 
3
persons living in areas that exceed standards estab-
4
lished by the Environmental Protection Agency who 
5
purchase a filtration system to mitigate the effects 
6
of hexavalent chromium; and 
7
(5) encourages appropriate agencies at all levels 
8
of government to determine the causes of harmful 
9
levels of hexavalent chromium and take appropriate 
10
mitigation actions.
