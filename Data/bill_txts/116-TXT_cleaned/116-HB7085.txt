A BILL 
To amend the Revised Statutes to remove the defense of 
qualified immunity in the case of any action under sec-
tion 1979, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Ending Qualified Im-
4
munity Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
The Congress finds as follows:

•HR 7085 IH
(1) In 1871, Congress passed the Ku Klux 
1
Klan Act to combat rampant violations of civil and 
2
constitutionally secured rights across the Nation, 
3
particularly in the post-Civil War South. 
4
(2) Included in the act was a provision, now 
5
codified at section 1983 of title 42, United States 
6
Code, which provides a cause of action for individ-
7
uals to file lawsuits against State and local officials 
8
who violate their legal and constitutionally secured 
9
rights. 
10
(3) Section 1983 has never included a defense 
11
or immunity for government officials who act in 
12
good faith when violating rights, nor has it ever had 
13
a defense or immunity based on whether the right 
14
was ‘‘clearly established’’ at the time of the viola-
15
tion. 
16
(4) From the law’s beginning in 1871, through 
17
the 1960s, government actors were not afforded 
18
qualified immunity for violating rights. 
19
(5) In 1967, the Supreme Court in Pierson v. 
20
Ray, 386 U.S. 547, suddenly found that government 
21
actors had a good faith defense for making arrests 
22
under unconstitutional statutes based on a common 
23
law defense for the tort of false arrest.

•HR 7085 IH
(6) The Court later extended this beyond false 
1
arrests, turning it into a general good faith defense 
2
for government officials. 
3
(7) Finally, in Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 
4
800 (1982), the Court found the subjective search 
5
for good faith in the government actor unnecessary, 
6
and replaced it with an ‘‘objective reasonableness’’ 
7
standard that requires that the right be ‘‘clearly es-
8
tablished’’ at the time of the violation for the de-
9
fendant to be liable. 
10
(8) This doctrine of qualified immunity has se-
11
verely limited the ability of many plaintiffs to re-
12
cover damages under section 1983 when their rights 
13
have been violated by State and local officials. As a 
14
result, the intent of Congress in passing the law has 
15
been frustrated, and Americans’ rights secured by 
16
the Constitution have not been appropriately pro-
17
tected. 
18
SEC. 3. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS. 
19
It is the sense of the Congress that we must correct 
20
the erroneous interpretation of section 1983 which pro-
21
vides for qualified immunity, and reiterate the standard 
22
found on the face of the statute, which does not limit li-
23
ability on the basis of the defendant’s good faith beliefs

or on the basis that the right was not ‘‘clearly established’’ 
1
at the time of the violation. 
2
SEC. 4. REMOVAL OF QUALIFIED IMMUNITY. 
3
Section 1979 of the Revised Statutes (42 U.S.C. 
4
1983) is amended by adding at the end the following: ‘‘It 
5
shall not be a defense or immunity to any action brought 
6
under this section that the defendant was acting in good 
7
faith, or that the defendant believed, reasonably or other-
8
wise, that his or her conduct was lawful at the time when 
9
it was committed. Nor shall it be a defense or immunity 
10
that the rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the 
11
Constitution or laws were not clearly established at the 
12
time of their deprivation by the defendant, or that the 
13
state of the law was otherwise such that the defendant 
14
could not reasonably have been expected to know whether 
15
his or her conduct was lawful.’’.
