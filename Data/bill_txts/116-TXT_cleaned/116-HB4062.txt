SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. 
1
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that— 
2
(1) the manufacture, distribution, and importa-
3
tion of firearms is inherently commercial in nature; 
4
(2) firearms regularly move in interstate com-
5
merce; 
6
01:35 Aug 03, 2019
H4062

•HR 4062 IH
(3) to the extent that firearms trafficking is 
1
intrastate in nature, it arises out of and is substan-
2
tially connected with a commercial transaction that, 
3
when viewed in the aggregate, substantially affects 
4
interstate commerce; 
5
(4) because the intrastate and interstate traf-
6
ficking of firearms are so commingled, full regula-
7
tion of interstate commerce requires the incidental 
8
regulation of intrastate commerce; 
9
(5) firearm-related assaults in the United 
10
States— 
11
(A) during the 16-year period between 
12
2001 and 2016, were associated with the major-
13
ity of homicides and half of all suicides; and 
14
(B) during the 15-year period between 
15
2001 and 2015, were the seventh leading cause 
16
of nonfatal violent injuries; 
17
(6) on the afternoon of May 10, 2007, Blair 
18
Holt, a junior at Julian High School in Chicago, was 
19
killed on a public bus riding home from school when 
20
he used his body to shield a girl who was in the line 
21
of fire after a young man boarded the bus and start-
22
ed shooting; 
23
(7) since 2007, when 32 students and teachers 
24
were killed at Virginia Tech, 7 of the 11 most deadly 
25

•HR 4062 IH
mass shootings in the United States have taken 
1
place; 
2
(8) since 2012, when 20 first graders and 
3
teachers were murdered with an assault rifle at 
4
Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Con-
5
necticut, more than 230 school shootings have oc-
6
curred in the United States; 
7
(9) in 2015, there were 294 mass shootings, in-
8
cluding, notably, the shooting at Umpqua Commu-
9
nity College in Oregon, the Charleston church shoot-
10
ing in South Carolina, the theatre shooting in La-
11
fayette, Louisiana, and the Isla Vista community 
12
shootings in California; 
13
(10) since 2016, the country has witnessed 4 of 
14
the 10 worst gun massacres in modern United 
15
States history; and 
16
(11) in February 2018, 17 members of the 
17
Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School community 
18
in Parkland, Florida, lost their lives at the hands of 
19
a 19-year-old armed with an AR–15 semiautomatic 
20
assault rifle. 
21
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
22
gress that— 
23
(1) firearms trafficking is prevalent and wide-
24
spread in and among the States, and it is usually 
25
01:35 Aug 03, 2019
H4062
5 
•HR 4062 IH
impossible to distinguish between intrastate traf-
1
ficking and interstate trafficking; and 
2
(2) it is in the national interest and within the 
3
role of the Federal Government to ensure that the 
4
regulation of firearms is uniform among the States, 
5
that law enforcement can quickly and effectively 
6
trace firearms used in crime, and that firearms own-
7
ers know how to use and safely store their firearms. 
8
(c) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this Act and the 
9
amendments made by this Act are— 
10
(1) to protect the public against the unreason-
11
able risk of injury and negligent or reckless death 
12
associated with the unrecorded sale or transfer of 
13
qualifying firearms to criminals and youths; 
14
(2) to ensure that owners of qualifying firearms 
15
are knowledgeable in the safe use, handling, and 
16
storage of those firearms; 
17
(3) to restrict the availability of qualifying fire-
18
arms to criminals, youth, and other persons prohib-
19
ited by Federal law from receiving firearms; 
20
(4) to facilitate the tracing of qualifying fire-
21
arms used in crime by Federal and State law en-
22
forcement agencies; and 
23
(5) to hold criminally and civilly liable those 
24
who facilitate the transfer of qualifying firearms,
