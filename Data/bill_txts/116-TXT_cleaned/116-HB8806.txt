It is the sense of Congress that— 
2
(1) continued inaction by the Federal Govern-

poses a significant threat to the growth and stability 
5
of the economy and population of the United States; 
6
(2) pension and retirement funds are vulnerable 
7
to distinct risks relating to climate change, includ-
8
ing— 
9
(A) climate impact risks, including sea 
10
level rise, heat waves, desertification, ocean 
11
acidification, flooding, drought, extreme weath-
12
er, and wildfires; 
13
(B) carbon-constrained demand risks, in-
14
cluding stranded carbon assets, which financial 
15
institutions have estimated as having a value of 
16
$100,000,000,000,000; and 
17
(C) climate liability risks, including from 
18
evolving 
interpretations 
of 
fiduciary 
and 
19
tortious duties of care; and 
20
(3) assessing the potential impact of climate-re-
21
lated risks on national and international financial 
22
systems, including retirement savings accounts and 
23
pensions, is an urgent concern.
