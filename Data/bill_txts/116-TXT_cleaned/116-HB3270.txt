A BILL 
To amend title 18, United States Code, to provide a defense 
to prosecution for fraud and related activity in connec-
tion with computers for persons defending against unau-
thorized intrusions into their computers, and for other 
purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Active Cyber Defense 
4
Certainty Act’’.

SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Cyber fraud and related cyber-enabled 
3
crimes pose a severe threat to the national security 
4
and economic vitality of the United States. 
5
(2) As a result of the unique nature of 
6
cybercrime, it is very difficult for law enforcement to 
7
respond to and prosecute cybercrime in a timely 
8
manner, leading to the existing low level of deter-
9
rence and a rapidly growing threat. In 2017, the De-
10
partment of Justice prosecuted only 165 cases of 
11
computer fraud. Congress determines that this sta-
12
tus quo is unacceptable and that if left unchecked, 
13
the trend in cybercrime will only continue to deterio-
14
rate. 
15
(3) Cybercriminals have developed new tactics 
16
for monetizing the proceeds of their criminal acts, 
17
making it likely that the criminal activity will be fur-
18
ther incentivized in the absence of reforms to cur-
19
rent law allowing for new cyber tools and deterrence 
20
methods for defenders. 
21
(4) When a citizen or United States business is 
22
victimized as the result of such crime, the first re-
23
course should be to report the crime to law enforce-
24
ment and seek to improve defensive measures. 
25

(5) Congress also acknowledges that many 
1
cyberattacks could be prevented through improved 
2
cyber defensive practices, including enhanced train-
3
ing, strong passwords, and routine updating and 
4
patching to computer systems. 
5
(6) Congress determines that the use of active 
6
cyber defense techniques, when properly applied, can 
7
also assist in improving defenses and deterring 
8
cybercrimes. 
9
(7) Congress also acknowledges that many pri-
10
vate entities are increasingly concerned with stem-
11
ming the growth of dark web based cyber-enabled 
12
crimes. The Department of Justice should attempt 
13
to clarify the proper protocol for entities who are en-
14
gaged in active cyber defense in the dark web so 
15
that these defenders can return private property 
16
such as intellectual property and financial records 
17
gathered inadvertently. 
18
(8) Congress also recognizes that while Federal 
19
agencies will need to prioritize cyber incidents of na-
20
tional significance, there is the potential to assist the 
21
private sector by being more responsive to reports of 
22
crime through different reporting mechanisms. Many 
23
reported cybercrimes are not responded to in a time-
24

•HR 3270 IH
ly manner creating significant uncertainty for many 
1
businesses and individuals. 
2
(9) Computer defenders should also exercise ex-
3
treme caution to avoid violating the law of any other 
4
nation where an attacker’s computer may reside. 
5
(10) Congress holds that active cyber defense 
6
techniques should only be used by qualified defend-
7
ers with a high degree of confidence in attribution, 
8
and that extreme caution should be taken to avoid 
9
impacting intermediary computers or resulting in an 
10
escalatory cycle of cyber activity. 
11
(11) It is the purpose of this Act to provide 
12
legal certainty by clarifying the type of tools and 
13
techniques that defenders can use that exceed the 
14
boundaries of their own computer network.
