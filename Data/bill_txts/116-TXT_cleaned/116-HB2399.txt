•HR 2399 IH
(1) The Departments of Housing and Urban 
1
Development (HUD) and Veterans Affairs (VA) 
2
jointly support veterans experiencing homelessness 
3
by providing permanent supportive housing. 
4
(2) The HUD–VA Supportive Housing voucher 
5
program (HUD–VASH) has successfully decreased 
6
the number of homeless veterans. 
7
(3) Since the establishment of the HUD–VASH 
8
voucher program in 2008, more than 97,000 vouch-
9
ers have been awarded to public housing agencies 
10
and more than 170,000 homeless veterans have been 
11
provided with vouchers. 
12
(4) The number of veterans experiencing home-
13
lessness has declined by over 30,000 since 2009, ac-
14
cording to data from the annual Point-in-Time 
15
Homeless Count organized by HUD. 
16
(5) Under the HUD–VASH program, veterans 
17
benefit from affordable housing and matching sup-
18
portive services, such as mental health treatment, 
19
substance use counseling, and employment training. 
20
(6) In the past year, some regions of the Nation 
21
have seen an increase in the numbers of veterans ex-
22
periencing homelessness, particularly in high-cost 
23
housing markets where housing is becoming less af-
24
fordable.
