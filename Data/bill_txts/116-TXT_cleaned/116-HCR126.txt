CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the Congress that the President 
should direct the Secretary of State to immediately issue 
a notice of intent to terminate the commercial and power 
coordination provisions of the Columbia River Treaty 
between the United States and Canada. 
Whereas the U.S. Entity Regional Recommendation for the 
Future of the Columbia River Treaty after 2024 was 
issued in December 2013 calling for the prompt renegoti-
ation of the Columbia River Treaty between the United 
States and Canada; 
Whereas Article XIX of the Columbia River Treaty allows the 
United States to issue a 10-year advance notice of its in-

tent to terminate the commercial and power coordination 
provisions of the Treaty; 
Whereas the first opportunity for the United States to issue 
a termination notice was in 2014; 
Whereas the U.S. Entity Regional Recommendation for the 
Future of the Columbia River Treaty after 2024 called 
upon the United States to pursue ‘‘other options’’ absent 
a renegotiated Treaty by 2015; 
Whereas the United States and Canada did not commence 
negotiations to modernize the Columbia River Treaty 
until 2018; 
Whereas the United States and Canada have conducted 10 
rounds of Columbia River Treaty negotiations since early 
2018, including only two negotiating sessions in 2020; 
Whereas the Columbia River Treaty requires that Northwest 
electric ratepayers in the States of Idaho, Montana, Or-
egon, and Washington annually send between $150 and 
$250 million of clean, renewable United States hydro-
power north to British Columbia; 
Whereas in return, Canada provides the United States with 
a hydropower operation that creates less than $15 million 
in value; 
Whereas the United States Government’s failure to issue the 
termination notice in 2014, pursuant to Article XIX of 
the Columbia River Treaty, has cost Northwest electric 
ratepayers approximately $1 billion to date, a figure that 
grows each day; 
Whereas the notice of intent to terminate the commercial and 
power coordination provisions under Article XIX of the 
Columbia River Treaty does not impact the Treaty’s 
flood control provisions; and

•HCON 126 IH 
Whereas the issuance of the notice of intent to terminate the 
commercial and power coordination provisions initiates a 
10-year period for the United States and Canada to ne-
gotiate a modernized Treaty equitable to both countries 
before any changes to the current Treaty enter into force: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate 
1
concurring), That it is the sense of the Congress that the 
2
President should direct the Secretary of State to imme-

diately issue a notice of intent to terminate the commercial 
4
and power coordination provisions of the Columbia River 
5
Treaty between the United States and Canada.
