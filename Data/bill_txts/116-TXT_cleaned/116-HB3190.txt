SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
11
Congress finds the following: 
12
(1) On August 25, 2017, Burmese military and 
13
security forces violently and disproportionately re-
14
sponded to an attack on security outposts, resulting 
15
in a mass exodus of Rohingya from the Rakhine 
16
State of Burma into Bangladesh, which the Inter-
17
national Organization of Migration called ‘‘unprece-
18
dented in terms of volume and speed’’. 
19
(2) Between August 2017 and March 2019, in 
20
response to the violence perpetrated by the Burmese 
21
military and security forces, the United Nations esti-
22
mates more than 740,000 Rohingya, approximately 
23
75 percent of whom are women and children, have 
24
fled to Bangladesh, fearing loss of life, livelihoods, 
25
05:04 Jun 14, 2019
H3190
5 
•HR 3190 IH
and shelter. Rohingya have continued to flee Burma 
1
in significant numbers, including in 2019. According 
2
to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refu-
3
gees, more than 1,400 Rohingya have arrived in 
4
Bangladesh since January 1, 2019. 
5
(3) Even after the Burmese military scaled 
6
back attacks against Rohingya in late 2017, security 
7
forces continued to impose restrictions on the basic 
8
freedoms of Rohingya in Rakhine State, including on 
9
freedom of movement. In November 2017, Amnesty 
10
International determined that Rohingya remaining 
11
in Rakhine are ‘‘trapped in a vicious system of state- 
12
sponsored, 
institutionalized 
discrimination 
that 
13
amounts to apartheid’’. 
14
(4) Despite the steps taken toward democracy 
15
in Burma, there exists limited control by the civilian 
16
government over civilian agencies as well as military 
17
and security forces that carried out the violence in 
18
Rakhine State. The military and security forces con-
19
tinue to engage in grave human rights abuses 
20
against ethnic minorities throughout in the country. 
21
(5) Both government- and military-initiated in-
22
vestigations into human rights abuses in Burma in-
23
volving violence between ethnic minorities and Bur-
24
20:43 Jun 14, 2019
H3190
6 
•HR 3190 IH
mese security forces have failed to yield credible re-
1
sults or hold perpetrators accountable. 
2
(6) In a public address on October 12, 2017, 
3
State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi laid out the fol-
4
lowing goals for the State of Rakhine: 
5
(A) Repatriation of those who have crossed 
6
over to Bangladesh. 
7
(B) Effective provision of humanitarian as-
8
sistance. 
9
(C) Resettlement of displaced populations. 
10
(D) Economic development and durable 
11
peace. 
12
(7) Due to restrictions enforced by the Rakhine 
13
State government and the national military and se-
14
curity forces, there has been little progress made 
15
since that time and limited ability for the inter-
16
national community to support, verify, or evaluate 
17
the Government of Burma’s efforts. There are also 
18
credible reports of Burmese military and security 
19
forces bulldozing numerous villages where violence 
20
occurred, thus destroying physical evidence, and in 
21
some cases, constructing new military installations 
22
on top of the bulldozed villages. 
23
(8) On November 22, 2017, former Secretary of 
24
State Rex Tillerson stated that ‘‘After a careful and 
25
20:43 Jun 14, 2019
H3190
7 
•HR 3190 IH
thorough analysis of available facts, it is clear that 
1
the situation in northern Rakhine state constitutes 
2
ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya. Those re-
3
sponsible for these atrocities must be held account-
4
able’’. He also said the violence ‘‘has a number of 
5
characteristics of certainly crimes against human-
6
ity’’. Despite repeated requests from Members of 
7
Congress, as well as the result of its own investiga-
8
tion (the executive summary of which was released 
9
on September 17, 2018), the Department has de-
10
clined to make a determination if the atrocities in 
11
Rakhine State constitute genocide or crimes against 
12
humanity. 
13
(9) On December 12, 2017, Wa Lone and 
14
Kyaw Soe Oo, two Reuters reporters covering the 
15
crisis in Rakhine State, were entrapped, arrested, 
16
and charged with violating the Official Secrets Act, 
17
continuing a trend of restricting media and free 
18
speech and attempting to thwart coverage of the 
19
events in Rakhine State. 
20
(10) Another barrier to the voluntary, safe, dig-
21
nified and sustainable return of the Rohingya to 
22
Rakhine State is the refusal of the Government of 
23
Burma to reinstate the full citizenship of the 
24
Rohingya, as well as the Government’s unwillingness 
25
20:43 Jun 14, 2019
H3190
8 
•HR 3190 IH
to consider the repeal of or amendments to the Citi-
1
zenship Act of 1982 that stripped the Rohingya of 
2
their full citizenship. 
3
(11) During 2018, the ongoing conflict in 
4
Burma escalated in Kachin and Shan States, re-
5
ignited in Karen (Kayin) State, and spread into 
6
Chin and Rakhine States. Along with the increase in 
7
fighting between Burma’s security forces and several 
8
ethnic armed organizations, there was a rise in alle-
9
gations of human rights abuses perpetrated by Bur-
10
mese security forces in these conflict areas. 
11
(12) In April 2018, thousands of civilians fled 
12
fighting between the military and ethnic armed 
13
groups in Kachin State, prompting peaceful dem-
14
onstrations. In December 2018, three prominent ac-
15
tivist in Kachin State, Lum Zawng, Nang Pu and 
16
Zau Jet were convicted and sentenced to six months 
17
imprisonment for defaming the military. 
18
(13) On June 6, 2018, the United Nations Ref-
19
ugee Agency and the United Nations Development 
20
Programme signed a tripartite Memorandum of Un-
21
derstanding with Burma. The Office of the United 
22
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and var-
23
ious international human rights and international re-
24
lief agencies agreed that conditions in Rakhine State 
25
05:04 Jun 14, 2019
H3190
9 
•HR 3190 IH
are not sufficient for the voluntary, safe, dignified, 
1
and sustainable return of the Rohingya. 
2
(14) The United Nations Independent Inter-
3
national Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar, the De-
4
partment of State, and more than a dozen human 
5
rights organizations have reported and documented 
6
a campaign of violence perpetrated by the security 
7
forces of Burma, which indiscriminately fired on and 
8
killed civilians, raped women and girls, and arrested 
9
Rohingya men without any cause or charges. Sat-
10
ellite images obtained by Amnesty International re-
11
veal that, out of the approximately 470 villages in 
12
northern Rakhine State, nearly 300 were partially or 
13
completely destroyed by fire since August 25, 2017, 
14
most of which were completely or partially populated 
15
by Rohingya Muslims. 
16
(15) In its report of September 17, 2018, the 
17
United Nations Independent International Fact- 
18
Finding Mission on Myanmar determined that there 
19
was sufficient evidence of ‘‘genocidal intent’’ in the 
20
attacks against the Rohingya in Rakhine State, and 
21
probable ‘‘crimes against humanity’’ and ‘‘war 
22
crimes’’ in Burmese security forces assaults on eth-
23
nic minorities in Kachin and Shan States. The Mis-
24
sion recommended that the United Nations Security 
25
05:04 Jun 14, 2019
H3190
10 
•HR 3190 IH
Council ‘‘should ensure accountability for crimes 
1
under international law committed in Myanmar, 
2
preferably by referring the situation to the Inter-
3
national Criminal Court or alternatively by creating 
4
an ad hoc international criminal tribunal’’. The Mis-
5
sion also recommended the imposition of targeted 
6
economic sanctions, including an arms embargo on 
7
Burma. 
8
(16) On September 3, 2018, Wa Lone and 
9
Kyaw Soe Oo were convicted and sentenced to seven 
10
years in prison and released as an act of Presi-
11
dential amnesty on May 6, 2019, after over 500 
12
days in jail. Time Magazine included pictures the 
13
two reporters on the cover of its ‘‘Person of the 
14
Year’’ issue on December 10, 2018, as two of the 
15
‘‘Guardians and the War on Truth’’. 
16
(17) According to the free-speech organization 
17
Athan, 44 journalists and 142 activists have faced 
18
trial since 2016 charged with colonial-era laws used 
19
to stifle dissent, while tightening restrictions on ac-
20
tivist groups. 
21
(18) On September 28, 2018, the United Na-
22
tions Human Rights Council passed a resolution 
23
that calls for an independent mechanism to collect 
24
and analyze evidence in regard to the serious inter-
25
05:04 Jun 14, 2019
H3190
11 
•HR 3190 IH
national crimes committed in Burma against 
1
Rohingya Muslims and other minorities since 2011. 
2
The resolution requests that the independent mecha-
3
nism ‘‘prepare files in order to facilitate and expe-
4
dite fair and independent criminal proceedings, in 
5
accordance with international law standards, in na-
6
tional, regional or international courts or tribunals 
7
that have or may in the future have jurisdiction over 
8
these crimes’’. 
9
(19) On November 15, 2018, the Government 
10
of Bangladesh and the Government of Burma aban-
11
doned plans to return more than 2,000 Rohingya to 
12
Rakhine State after it was determined that none 
13
were willing to voluntarily return given the current 
14
conditions in Rakhine State, as well as the Govern-
15
ment of Burma’s failure to ensure the returnees’ 
16
safety, dignity, or sustainability of their livelihoods. 
17
(20) A December 2018 report by the Public 
18
Law Interest & Policy group noted that ‘‘the de-
19
struction of their villages, crops, and virtually all in-
20
frastructure clearly points to a strategy of ensuring 
21
the Rohingya’s permanent removal. The mass 
22
killings and accompanying brutality, including 
23
against children, women, pregnant women, the elder-
24
ly, and those crossing the border to Bangladesh fur-
25

H3190

•HR 3190 IH
ther suggest, however, that, at least in the minds of 
1
some perpetrators, the goal was not only to expel, 
2
but also to exterminate the Rohingya . . .’’ and that 
3
‘‘there are reasonable grounds to believe that crimes 
4
against humanity, genocide, and war crimes have 
5
been committed against the Rohingya in Myanmar’s 
6
northern Rakhine State’’. 
7
(21) Despite substantial evidence of widespread 
8
and systematic atrocities committed by Burmese se-
9
curity forces in Rakhine State, State Counselor 
10
Aung San Suu Kyi and Burma’s Commander-in- 
11
Chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing continue to 
12
maintain that no such widespread and systematic 
13
atrocities occurred. 
14
(22) On December 13, 2018, the United States 
15
House of Representatives passed House Resolution 
16
1091 (115th Congress) which expressed the sense of 
17
the House that ‘‘the atrocities committed against the 
18
Rohingya by the Burmese military and security 
19
forces since August 2017 constitute crimes against 
20
humanity and genocide’’ and called upon the Sec-
21
retary of State to review the available evidence and 
22
make a similar determination. 
23
(23) On December 19, 2018, the United Na-
24
tions 
Humanitarian 
Coordinator 
requested

(24) The 2019 Joint Response Plan for the 
3
Rohingya Humanitarian Crisis asks the inter-
4
national community to provide $20,500,000 in as-
5
sistance to meet needs in Bangladesh. 
6
(25) On May 14, 2019, the United Nations 
7
Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar urged all coun-

tries to cut off economic ties to Burma’s military- 
9
owned businesses, stating ‘‘. . . due to the gravity 
10
of past and continuing violations, attention must be 
11
given to the political, economic and financial ties of 
12
the Myanmar military . . . so we can cut off the 
13
money supply as a means of increasing pressure and

reducing the violence.’’.

SEC. 301. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE MINING SECTOR OF 
19
BURMA. 
20
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
21
(1) In 2015, the nongovernmental organization 
22
Global Witness estimated that the value of total pro-
23
duction 
of 
jade 
in 
Burma 
in 
2014 
was 
24
$31,000,000,000, almost 48 percent of the official 
25

H3190
36 
•HR 3190 IH
gross domestic product of Burma. As much as 80 
1
percent of that jade sold is smuggled out of Burma. 
2
(2) Burma’s military and associated entities, in-
3
cluding companies owned or controlled by Myanmar 
4
Economic Corporation and Myanmar Economic 
5
Holding Limited, their affiliated companies, and 
6
companies owned or controlled by current and 
7
former senior military officers or their family mem-
8
bers, are linked to the mining sector, including the 
9
gemstone industry, and benefit financially from 
10
widespread illegal smuggling of jade and rubies from 
11
Burma. 
12
(3) 
Illegal 
trafficking 
in 
precious 
and 
13
semiprecious stones from Burma, including the trade 
14
in high-value jade and rubies, deprives the people of 
15
Burma and the civilian government of critical rev-
16
enue and instead benefits military-linked entities, 
17
non-state armed groups, and transnational organized 
18
criminal networks. 
19
(4) In 2016, the Government of Burma began 
20
to take steps to reform aspects of the mining sector, 
21
including— 
22
(A) improving governance in the gemstone 
23
industry, 
by 
temporarily 
suspending
