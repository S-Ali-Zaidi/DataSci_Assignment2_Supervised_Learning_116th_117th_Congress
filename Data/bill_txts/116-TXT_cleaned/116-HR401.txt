ers in the United States is inextricably tied to the story 
of the United States; 
Whereas the Asian-American and Pacific Islander community 
is an inherently diverse population, comprised of over 45 
distinct ethnicities and over 100 language dialects;

Asian-American population grew faster than any other 
racial or ethnic group over the last decade, surging nearly 
72 percent between 2000 and 2015;

United States who identify themselves as Asian and ap-

identify themselves as Native Hawaiian or Pacific Is-
lander, making up nearly 7 percent of the total United 
States population;

American Heritage Month because the first Japanese im-
migrants arrived in the United States on May 7, 1843, 
and the first transcontinental railroad was completed on 
May 10, 1869, with substantial contributions from Chi-
nese immigrants; 
Whereas section 102 of title 36, United States Code, officially 
designates May as Asian/Pacific American Heritage 
Month and requests the President to issue an annual 
proclamation calling on the people of the United States 
to observe the month with appropriate programs, cere-
monies, and activities;

Whereas there remains much to be done to ensure that Asian 
Americans and Pacific Islanders have access to resources 
and a voice in the Government of the United States and 
continue to advance in the political landscape of the 
United States; and 
Whereas celebrating Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month 
provides the people of the United States with an oppor-
tunity to recognize the achievements, contributions, and 
history of, and to understand the challenges faced by, 
Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
