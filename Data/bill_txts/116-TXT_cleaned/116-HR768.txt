RESOLUTION 
Calling on African governments to protect and promote 
human rights through internet freedom and digital inte-
gration for all citizens across the continent of Africa. 
Whereas access to information and freedom of expression are 
pillars of an open, free, and democratic society; 
Whereas open and secure access to the internet enables the 
exercise of human rights and freedom of expression, al-
lowing people to connect, access information, and partici-
pate in a global society; 
Whereas according to Access Now, there were 21 instances 
of partial or total internet shutdowns in Africa in 2018, 
compared with only 4 in 2016; 
Whereas governments, including those of Chad, Cameroon, 
Ethiopia, Uganda, Sudan, and Zimbabwe, have restricted

access to the internet and disrupted networks, online ap-
plications, and services to censor and interfere with the 
flow of information during politically sensitive moments, 
including elections, political protests, and mass dem-
onstrations, when unfettered journalism, public oversight, 
and political participation are crucial to bolster demo-
cratic processes and the rule of law; 
Whereas governments often attempt to justify partial or total 
internet shutdowns for purposes of security or to stop the 
spread of false information; 
Whereas the frequency of internet shutdowns has increased 
across Africa, levying broad economic costs and directly 
violating citizens rights to freedom of expression and ac-
cess to information; 
Whereas African whistleblowers, journalists, bloggers, and 
other media workers often lack legal protection and suf-
fer harassment and detention at the hands of government 
authorities, often facilitated by invasive and unauthorized 
surveillance, with the encouragement, technical expertise, 
and financial support of foreign entities and govern-
ments; 
Whereas some African governments have introduced taxes to 
discourage citizens from sharing and accessing informa-
tion in the digital space, and have imposed laws and reg-
ulations that often target journalists, bloggers, activists, 
and others, banning speech and discouraging expression 
in the digital space; 
Whereas those operating independent news websites and 
blogs are obstructed through blocking and censorship, 
burdensome licensing requirements, and regulatory meas-

ures that effectively limit their audience and their liveli-
hoods; 
Whereas many African governments lack robust data protec-
tion and privacy laws, and the systems to implement such 
laws, leaving the privacy of citizens exposed and suscep-
tible to infringement; 
Whereas the Communist government in China, through the 
desire to build a ‘‘digital Silk Road’’, has increased cyber 
activity in Africa through telecommunications contracts 
and fiber optic networks which can expose individuals to 
greater monitoring and surveillance, and has exported 
technology and training to authoritarian officials that 
have made it easier to restrict internet access in many 
African countries; 
Whereas Huawei Technologies has reportedly sold products 
and services to African governments that have been used 
to support spying on political opponents; and 
Whereas Russia has been testing new disinformation tech-
niques and tactics through a series of online networks 
linked to Yevgeny Prigozhin, a Russian oligarch indicted 
by the United States for meddling in the United States 
Presidential election in 2016, in African countries that 
include Sudan, Cameroon, Libya, and Mozambique: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—

(1) strongly condemns the restriction or disrup-

tion of the internet through methods including net-
3
work shutdowns, disruptions, use of ‘‘kill switches’’, 
4
bandwidth throttling, high taxes, and the blocking of

(C) actively pursue laws and policies that 
15
protect and promote human rights online and

offline and review laws that criminalize free

those who offer dissenting views and informa-

states, like China, and avoid digital governance
