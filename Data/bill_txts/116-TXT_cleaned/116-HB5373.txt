SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) The United States Anti-Doping Agency (re-
8
ferred to in this Act as the ‘‘USADA’’) is the na-
9
tional anti-doping organization in the United States 
10

and is charged with managing the anti-doping pro-
1
gram, results management processes, drug reference 
2
resources, and athlete education for all United 
3
States Olympic Committee (referred to in this Act 
4
as the ‘‘USOC’’) recognized sport national governing 
5
bodies, their athletes, and events. 
6
(2) The USADA also contributes to the ad-
7
vancement of clean sport through scientific research, 
8
anti-doping education, and outreach programs, and 
9
its vision is to be a guardian of the values and life 
10
lessons learned through true sport. 
11
(3) Participation in youth sports has the poten-
12
tial to equip young athletes with important skills 
13
and values necessary for success in life, but it is es-
14
sential that the culture of youth sports emphasizes 
15
those skills and values. 
16
(4) The USADA’s TrueSport program partners 
17
with youth sport organizations across the country to 
18
promote sportsmanship, character building, and 
19
healthy performance through the use of targeted 
20
education materials designed to promote a positive 
21
youth sport experience. 
22
(5) By including the promotion of the positive 
23
values of youth sport in USADA’s mandate, Con-
24
gress sends a strong signal that the goals of youth 
25

•HR 5373 IH
sport should include instilling the values of integrity, 
1
respect, teamwork, courage, and responsibility in our 
2
young athletes. 
3
(6) Furthermore, because the United States is 
4
in a unique position to exert leadership and influ-
5
ence within the global community, it is imperative 
6
that USADA be adequately funded for its anti- 
7
doping and clean sport programs in preparation for 
8
the 2028 Summer Olympic Games, which will be 
9
held in Los Angeles, California. 
10
(7) By increasing USADA’s authorization of 
11
appropriations in fiscal years 2021 through 2027, 
12
the Federal Government can empower USADA to di-
13
rectly affect the integrity and well-being of sport, 
14
both domestically and on a global scale.
