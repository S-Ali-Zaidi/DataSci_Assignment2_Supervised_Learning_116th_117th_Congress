•HR 2903 IH
(1) Federal retirement plans, including the 
1
Thrift Savings Plan, invest a total of over $550 bil-
2
lion on behalf of their plan participants. With such 
3
an influence, it is critical that U.S. Federal pension 
4
plans do not contribute to stock earnings for compa-
5
nies demonstrated to be linked to the economies of 
6
peer or near-peer competitors, as outlined in the Na-
7
tional Defense Strategy. 
8
(2) Large sector international companies such 
9
as Huawei have repeatedly committed numerous 
10
crimes such as corporate espionage, violations of 
11
US-imposed sanctions, violations of international 
12
property law, and theft. 
13
(3) The Thrift Savings Plan is the preeminent 
14
retirement plan for Federal government employees. 
15
The plan is especially beneficial due to its low serv-
16
ice fees and high historical returns. The provisions 
17
outlined in this Act will not increase fees imposed on 
18
clients of the Thrift Savings Plan.

(4) Congress acknowledges the conflict between 
20
fiduciary duties of financial investment firms and 
21
the responsibility to ensure national security.

eral Retirement Thrift Investment Board (as established
