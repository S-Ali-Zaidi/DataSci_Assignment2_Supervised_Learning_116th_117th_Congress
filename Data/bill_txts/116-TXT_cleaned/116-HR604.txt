RESOLUTION 
Condemning and censuring Adam Schiff, Representative of 
California’s 28th Congressional District. 
Whereas, President Trump released the transcript of a call 
between him and the President of Ukraine; 
Whereas, President Trump subsequently released the whistle-
blower complaint of August 12, 2019; 
Whereas, in a September 26, 2019, hearing on the whistle-
blower complaint, House Intelligence Committee Chair-
man Adam Schiff purported to relay the content of the 
phone call to the American people; 
Whereas, instead of quoting directly from the available tran-
script, Chairman Schiff manufactured a false retelling of 
the conversation between President Trump and President 
Zelensky;

Whereas, this egregiously false and fabricated retelling had 
no relationship to the call itself; 
Whereas, these actions of Chairman Schiff misled the Amer-
ican people, bring disrepute upon the House of Rep-
resentatives, and make a mockery of the impeachment 
process, one of this chamber’s most solemn constitutional 
duties; 
Whereas, for more than two years, Chairman Schiff has 
spread false accusations that the Trump Campaign 
colluded with Russia; 
Whereas, on March 20, 2017, then-Ranking Member Schiff 
read out false allegations from the Steele dossier accusing 
numerous Trump associates of colluding with Russia; 
Whereas, then-Ranking Member Schiff falsely claimed in a 
March 2017 interview to have ‘‘more than circumstantial 
evidence’’ of collusion with Russia; 
Whereas, then-Ranking Member Schiff negotiated with Rus-
sian comedians who he believed to be Ukrainian officials 
to obtain materials to damage the President of the 
United States politically; 
Whereas, members of the Intelligence Committee have lost 
faith in his objectivity and capabilities as Chairman, with 
every Republican member on the Committee having 
signed a letter calling for his immediate resignation as 
Chairman; and 
Whereas, Chairman Schiff has hindered the ability of the In-
telligence Committee to fulfill its oversight responsibilities 
of the Intelligence Community, an indispensable pillar of 
our national security: Now therefore, be it 
Resolved, That—
