RESOLUTION 
Affirming the importance of title IX, applauding the increase 
in educational opportunities available to all people, re-
gardless of sex or gender, and recognizing the tremen-
dous amount of work left to be done to further increase 
those opportunities. 
Whereas in 1972, President Richard M. Nixon signed into 
law title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (20 
U.S.C. 1681 et seq.) (referred to in this preamble as 
‘‘title IX’’); 
Whereas in 2002, Congress passed a joint resolution estab-
lishing that title IX may be cited as the ‘‘Patsy 
Takemoto Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act’’;

Whereas title IX prohibits any institution that receives Fed-
eral education funding from discriminating against stu-
dents or employees on the basis of sex; 
Whereas sex discrimination includes— 
(1) gender-based violence; 
(2) sexual harassment and assault; 
(3) dating violence; and 
(4) domestic violence; 
Whereas title IX guarantees— 
(1) equal educational opportunities for all students, 
including pregnant or parenting students and gender 
non-conforming students; and 
(2) protection for students from discrimination on 
the basis of actual or perceived sexual orientation or gen-
der identity; 
Whereas since 1972, the United States has made great 
progress in providing educational opportunities to women 
and girls and, in 2017, women earned the majority of 
doctoral, master’s, and associate degrees; 
Whereas in the 2016–2017 academic year, women earned ap-
proximately 57 percent of the bachelor’s degrees awarded 
by institutions of higher education in the United States 
for the 18th consecutive year; 
Whereas since 1972, the participation of women and girls in 
sports has increased by 1,000 percent in high school and 
greater than 500 percent in college, providing women and 
girls with the opportunity— 
(1) to develop leadership and teamwork skills; 
(2) to earn athletic scholarships to help finance a 
college degree; and 
(3) to become successful professional athletes;

•HRES 459 IH 
Whereas, despite the progress that has been made in higher 
education and athletics, women, girls, pregnant or par-
enting students, and transgender and gender non-con-
forming students in the United States are still frequently 
denied equal educational opportunities; 
Whereas pregnant and parenting students are more likely to 
drop out of high school compared to other students, and 
only 51 percent of teenage mothers earn a high school di-
ploma by the age of 22, leading to decreased opportuni-
ties for continuing education and employment; 
Whereas the number of baccalaureate degrees in science, 
technology, engineering, and math earned by women has 
decreased over the past decade and, as of the 2016–2017 
academic year, women earn only— 
(1) 38 percent of physical science degrees; 
(2) 19 percent of computing degrees; 
(3) 20 percent of engineering degrees; and 
(4) 42 percent of mathematics degrees; 
Whereas, despite representing 56 percent of all students en-
rolled in colleges and universities in the United States, 
women hold almost 2⁄3 of all outstanding student debt 
($900,000,000,000 of the total $1,400,000,000,000), and 
the average amount of student debt owed by a woman 
following the completion of a baccalaureate degree is 
$2,700 more than the average amount of student debt 
owed by a man; 
Whereas, despite constituting 50 percent of law school grad-
uates over the past 20 years, women constitute only 22.7 
percent of partners at major law firms;

Whereas, while women represent 75 percent of the healthcare 
workforce, only 12 percent of the chief executive officers 
of hospitals are women; 
Whereas 44 percent of all National Collegiate Athletic Asso-
ciation Division I, Division II, and Division III student 
athletes are women, but only 11 percent of the athletic 
directors in Division I sports are women; 
Whereas men still hold the vast majority of leadership posi-
tions, while women make up approximately— 
(1) 4.8 percent of the chief executive officers of com-
panies included in the S&P 500; 
(2) 18 percent of Governors; 
(3) 27.6 percent of executive officers elected in 
statewide elections; and 
(4) 30 percent of college and university presidents; 
Whereas, when data is disaggregated, women of color have 
lower rates of— 
(1) leadership positions; and 
(2) science, technology, engineering, and math de-
grees; 
Whereas women continue to experience sexual harassment 
and assault— 
(1) as minors; 
(2) at colleges and universities; and 
(3) in the workplace; 
Whereas 1 in 4 girls will experience some form of sexual 
abuse before turning 18 years old, with— 
(1) 8 percent of high school students experiencing 
physical dating violence; and 
(2) 7 percent of high school students experiencing 
sexual assault by a dating partner;

•HRES 459 IH 
Whereas experiencing sexual abuse can— 
(1) lead to symptoms of depression and anxiety; and 
(2) negatively impact academic achievement; 
Whereas multiple studies have confirmed that— 
(1) 1 in 5 women and 1 in 4 transgender or gender 
non-conforming students are sexually assaulted on college 
campuses; and 
(2) approximately 20 percent of girls have been the 
victims of sexual assault or attempted sexual assault 
while in high school; 
Whereas students face pervasive discrimination and harass-
ment on the basis of sexual orientation and gender iden-
tity in school, on college campuses, and in the workplace, 
which— 
(1) impedes the ability of the students to fully access 
the educational opportunities to which the students are 
entitled; and 
(2) constitutes sex discrimination; 
Whereas, because of the recent national focus on sexual har-
assment and assault, reporting to the Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission (referred to in this preamble as 
the ‘‘EEOC’’) has increased 12 percent from 2017 to 
2018, reflecting more accurate data on the prevalence of 
harassment and resulting in a 50 percent increase in law-
suits filed by the EEOC in 2018; 
Whereas the rule proposed by the Department of Education 
regarding title IX would substantially narrow campus 
protections and would irresponsibly reverse much of the 
progress made to combat sexual assaults on educational 
campuses; and

•HRES 459 IH 
Whereas, between 2011 and 2016, investigations by the Of-
fice for Civil Rights at the Department of Education into 
reports of sexual and dating violence and discrimination 
against transgender students have helped to identify and 
respond to systemic issues of discrimination against stu-
dents that otherwise would have gone unrecognized, yet 
recent actions from the Office for Civil Rights indicate 
that there will be fewer resources and less attention fo-
cused on issues of sexual and dating violence and dis-
crimination against transgender students moving for-
ward: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) applauds the tremendous increase in edu-
2
cational opportunities for women and girls, including 
3
in sports, since the passage of title IX of the Edu-
4
cation Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. 1681 et 
5
seq.); 
6
(2) encourages the Department of Education 
7
and the Department of Justice to protect the rights 
8
of students to have safe learning environments by 
9
working to ensure schools prevent and respond to 
10
discrimination and harassment on the basis of sex,

including— 
12
(A) sexual assault;

(B) harassment;

(F) discrimination or harassment on the

(3) recognizes the work that still remains to be 
5
done to secure the promise of title IX of the Edu-
6
cation Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. 1681 et 
7

shall discriminate against any person on the basis of
