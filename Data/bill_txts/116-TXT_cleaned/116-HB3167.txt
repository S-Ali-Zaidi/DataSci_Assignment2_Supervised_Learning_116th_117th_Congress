(3) the National Flood Insurance Program 
1
(NFIP) is a key component of the Federal Govern-
2
ment’s efforts to minimize the damage and financial 
3
impact of floods;

(4) the NFIP is the principal provider of flood 
5
insurance in the United States, covering over 5 mil-
6
lion households and businesses across the country; 
7
(5) affordability of flood insurance coverage re-
8
mains a serious concern; 
9

10
means of reducing risk;

13
rate discounts; and 
14
(8) in the absence of widespread private insur-

ance industry participation, and as a matter of na-

12
(1) take a structural-based mitigation approach

with respect to construction, which includes—

(A) recognizing any post-storm damage 
15
that may occur; and 
16
(B) pursuing designs that proactively mini-
17
mize future flood damage; 
18
(2) make individuals in the community aware, 
19
through any cost-effective and available means of 
20
education, of the best approaches regarding the con-
21
struction of properties that are able to survive

floods, which reduces the cost of future repairs; and

consider the measures described in paragraphs (1)
