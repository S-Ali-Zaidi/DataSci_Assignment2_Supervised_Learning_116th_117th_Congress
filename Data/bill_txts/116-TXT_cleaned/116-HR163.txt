RESOLUTION 
Urging action to increase equity within the legal cannabis 
marketplace. 
Whereas the communities that have been most harmed by 
cannabis prohibition are benefiting the least from the 
legal marijuana marketplace; 
Whereas a legacy of racial and ethnic injustices, compounded 
by the disproportionate collateral consequences of 80 
years of cannabis prohibition enforcement, now limits 
participation in the industry; 
Whereas 33 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, 
and Guam have adopted laws allowing legal access to 
cannabis, and 10 States, the District of Columbia, and

the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands have 
adopted laws legalizing cannabis for adult recreational 
use; 
Whereas a total of 47 States have reformed their laws per-
taining to cannabis outside of comport with the Schedule 
1 status of marijuana and its Federal criminalization; 
Whereas legal cannabis sales totaled $9.5 billion in 2017 and 
are projected to reach $23 billion by 2022; 
Whereas according to the American Civil Liberties Union 
(ACLU), enforcing cannabis prohibition laws costs tax-
payers approximately $3.6 billion a year; 
Whereas the continued enforcement of cannabis prohibition 
laws results in over 600,000 arrests annually, dispropor-
tionately impacting people of color who are almost 4 
times more likely to be arrested for cannabis possession 
than their White counterparts, despite equal rates of use 
across populations; 
Whereas people of color have been historically targeted by 
discriminatory sentencing practices resulting in Black 
men receiving drug sentences that are 13.1 percent 
longer than sentences imposed for White men and 
Latinos being nearly 6.5 times more likely to receive a 
Federal sentence for cannabis possession than non-His-
panic Whites; 
Whereas, in 2013, simple cannabis possession was the fourth 
most common cause of deportation for any offense and 
the most common cause of deportation for drug law viola-
tions; 
Whereas it is estimated that less than 1 percent of the can-
nabis industry is owned or operated by people of color;

Whereas applicants for cannabis licenses are limited by nu-
merous laws, regulations, and exorbitant permit applica-
tions and licensing fees in these States, which can total 
more than $700,000; 
Whereas historically disproportionate arrest and conviction 
rates make it particularly difficult for people of color to 
enter the legal cannabis marketplace, as most States bar 
these individuals from participating; 
Whereas Federal law severely limits access to loans and cap-
ital for cannabis businesses, disproportionately impacting 
minority small business owners; and 
Whereas some States and municipalities have taken proactive 
steps to mitigate inequalities in the legal cannabis mar-
ketplace and ensure equal participation in the industry: 
Now, therefore, be it

disparities in the cannabis marketplace participation and

to address, reverse, and repair the most egregious effects

of the War on Drugs on communities of color, in par-

5
(b) BEST PRACTICES AND STEPS.—The practices 
6
and steps referred to in this subsection include— 
7
(1) establishing licensing and application fees 
8
that are reasonable to cover only the costs of pro-
9
gram implementation and necessary regulations; 
10
(2) creating a system where licensing is to be 
11
obtained at the city or county level and should be 
12
based on regulations determined by the local juris-
13
diction that meet the State’s minimum require-
14
ments, which allows the community to determine the 
15
type and number of businesses, avoids arbitrary caps 
16
on licenses, and results in an industry more rep-
17
resentative of the local market; 
18
(3) in States where license caps are completely 
19
unavoidable, establishing local oversight and control 
20
of cannabis licenses by allowing local cities and mu-
21
nicipalities to prioritize licenses for local citizens and 
22
residents, especially individuals most impacted by 
23
the War on Drugs, by taking into account and 
24
prioritizing—

(5) creating more equitable licensing by— 
15
(A) eliminating broad felony restrictions 
16
for licensing; 
17
(B) focusing restrictions on entering the 
18
market to those, determined on a case-by-case 
19
basis for both licensees and employees, with 
20
criminal convictions that are relevant to the 
21
owning and operating of a business; and 
22
(C) prohibiting previous cannabis convic-

tions from consideration as justification for a 
24
denial of a license;

sive of individuals currently on parole or under any 
4
probationary agreement, for cannabis offenses;

7

8

nonsafety sensitive positions;

tion for persons currently under parole, probation, 
14
or other State supervision, or released on bail await-

ing trial, for conduct otherwise allowed under State 
16
cannabis laws;

enue from cannabis sales to be reinvested in commu-

nities that have been most affected by cannabis ar-
20
rests and the drug war, which most frequently have
