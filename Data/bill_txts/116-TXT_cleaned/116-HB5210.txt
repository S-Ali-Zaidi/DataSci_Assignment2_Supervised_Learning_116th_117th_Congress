(1) In 2019, the world is in the midst of the 
1
worst global displacement crisis in history, with 
2
more than 70,800,000 forcibly displaced persons, in-
3
cluding 25,900,000 refugees worldwide, over half of 
4
whom are children, according to estimates from the 
5
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. 
6
(2) In 2018, less than 5 percent of global reset-
7
tlement needs were met despite there being 
8
1,400,000 refugees in need of third-country resettle-
9
ment. 
10
(3) The United States refugee admissions pro-
11
gram is a life-saving solution that— 
12
(A) is critical to global humanitarian ef-
13
forts; 
14
(B) strengthens global security; 
15
(C) leverages United States foreign policy 
16
interests, including diplomatic and strategic in-
17
terests of supporting allies who often host a sig-
18
nificant and disproportionate share of refugees 
19
per capita;

(D) stabilizes sensitive regions impacted by 
21
forced migration by ensuring that the United 
22
States shares responsibility for global refugee 
23
protection;

uphold the human rights of refugees, including

5
an education, and freedom of movement;

12
fits to cities, States, and the United States as

15
tions of the United States, including under—

(4) The United States has historically been, 
10
and should continue to be, a global leader in— 
11
(A) responding to displacement crises 
12
around the world, including through the provi-
13
sion of robust humanitarian support;

of asylum seekers to access the United States

two consecutive historically low annual refugee 
6
admissions goals after nearly 45 years during

other migrants, United States national diplomatic 
17
and strategic interests, and local communities that 
18
benefit from the presence of refugees, asylees, and 
19
