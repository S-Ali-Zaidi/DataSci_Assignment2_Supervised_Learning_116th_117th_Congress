RESOLUTION 
Supporting the contributions of Catholic schools. 
Whereas Catholic schools in the United States are inter-
nationally acclaimed for their academic excellence and 
provide students with more than an exceptional scholastic 
education; 
Whereas Catholic schools instill a broad, values-added edu-
cation emphasizing the lifelong development of moral, in-
tellectual, physical, and social values in young people in 
the United States; 
Whereas Catholic schools serve the Nation by providing a di-
verse student population from all regions of the country

and all socioeconomic backgrounds a strong academic and 
moral foundation, including over 38 percent of students 
from racial and ethnic minority backgrounds and 19 per-
cent from non-Catholic families; 
Whereas Catholic schools are an affordable option for par-
ents, particularly in underserved urban areas; 
Whereas Catholic schools produce students strongly dedicated 
to their faith, values, families, and communities by pro-
viding an intellectually stimulating environment rich in 
spiritual, character, and moral development; 
Whereas Catholic schools are committed to community serv-
ice, producing graduates who hold ‘‘helping others’’ 
among their core values; 
Whereas the total Catholic school student enrollment for the 
2018–2019 academic year is almost 1.8 million and the 
student-teacher ratio is 12 to 1; 
Whereas the Catholic high school graduation rate is 99 per-
cent, with 87 percent of graduates attending 4-year col-
leges; 
Whereas in the 1972 pastoral message concerning Catholic 
education, the National Conference of Catholic Bishops 
stated, ‘‘Education is one of the most important ways by 
which the Church fulfills its commitment to the dignity 
of the person and building of community. Community is 
central to education ministry, both as a necessary condi-
tion and an ardently desired goal. The educational efforts 
of the Church, therefore, must be directed to forming 
persons-in-community; for the education of the individual 
Christian is important not only to his solitary destiny, 
but also the destinies of the many communities in which 
he lives.’’;

•HRES 51 IH 
Whereas the week of January 27, 2019, to February 2, 2019, 
has been designated as National Catholic Schools Week 
by the National Catholic Educational Association and the 
United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, and Janu-
ary 30, 2019, has been designated National Appreciation 
Day for Catholic Schools; 
Whereas the National Catholic Schools Week was first estab-
lished in 1974 and has been celebrated annually for the 
past 45 years; 
Whereas while some Catholic schools are challenged by de-
clining enrollments and school closures, the good news is 
that there is a strong demand and enthusiasm for Catho-
lic schools; 
Whereas 30 percent of Catholic schools have waiting lists for 
admission and new schools are opening across the coun-
try; and 
Whereas the theme for National Catholic Schools Week 2019 
is ‘‘Catholic Schools: Learn. Serve. Lead. Succeed’’: Now, 
therefore, be it
