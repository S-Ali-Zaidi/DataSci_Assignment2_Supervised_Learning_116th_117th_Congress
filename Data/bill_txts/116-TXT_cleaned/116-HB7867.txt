SEC. 4. STUDY ON TRANSMISSION OF INFECTIOUS DIS-
5
EASES IN AIRPLANE CABINS. 
6
(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 180 days after the 
7
date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall seek 
8
to enter into an agreement with the National Academies 
9
to conduct a study on the transmission of infectious dis-
10
eases, including airborne diseases, in the cabins of pas-
11
senger airplanes. 
12
(b) PARAMETERS OF STUDY.—The study required 
13
under subsection (a) shall consider, at a minimum— 
14
(1) air flow patterns and humidity levels in the 
15
cabins of passenger airplanes and the extent to 
16
which such patterns and humidity levels increase or 
17
decrease the possibility that a passenger may be ex-
18
posed to an airborne pathogen communicated by an-
19
other individual on board an airplane; 
20
(2) how uniformly the cabin air supply is com-
21
pletely exchanged and whether air in certain areas 
22
of the cabin is exchanged more quickly or slowly 
23
than in other areas of the cabin;

•HR 7867 IH
(3) the extent to which various recirculation 
1
systems and the respective filtration systems of such 
2
recirculation systems increase or decrease the likeli-
3
hood of exposure to a pathogen; 
4
(4) 
the 
extent 
to 
which 
the 
use 
of 
5
preconditioned air during embarkation and disem-
6
barkation changes the likelihood of a passenger’s ex-
7
posure to a pathogen as opposed to the use of air 
8
conditioning packs fed by the auxiliary power unit; 
9
and 
10
(5) other variables that determine the likelihood 
11
of an individual’s exposure to a pathogen on a pas-
12
senger airplane, including the use or location of per-
13
sonal air outlets, seating location, load factor, move-
14
ment of cabin crewmembers and passengers through-
15
out the cabin during the flight, embarkation, and 
16
disembarkation, testing and replacement frequency 
17
of air filters, commonly touched surfaces, use or lo-
18
cation of lavatories, and such other variables as the 
19
National Academies consider relevant.

(c) REPORT TO CONGRESS.—Not later than 1 year

SEC. 5. AIR CARRIER PRACTICES AND AIRPLANE DESIGN 
6
IMPROVEMENTS. 
7
(a) IN GENERAL.—Based on the results of the study 
8
required under section 4 and such other information as 
9
the Administrator considers relevant, the Administrator 
10
shall identify and evaluate prospective air carrier practices 
11
or procedures, and prospective features in the design or 
12
configuration of cabin surfaces and air conditioning and 
13
pressurization systems in passenger airplanes, that would 
14
reduce the extent of transmission of pathogens within the 
15
cabin. 
16
(b) REPORT.— 
17
(1) FOLLOW-UP REPORT.—Not later than 270 
18
days after the submission of the report under section 
19
4(c), the Administrator shall publish a report that 
20
lists each practice, procedure, and feature that the 
21
Administrator considered under subsection (a), along 
22
with an assessment of the extent to which such prac-
23
tice, procedure, or feature would reduce the trans-

mission of pathogens, irrespective of the cost of such

implementing such practice, procedure, or feature.

(2) PUBLICATION OF REPORT.—The Adminis-
3
trator shall— 
4
(A) transmit the report required under this

the issuance of the report required under subsection 
12
(b), the Administrator shall initiate one or more 
13
rulemaking proceedings to—

15
Federal Regulations, to require that applica-
16
tions for new type certificates (including 
17
amended type certificates) for new passenger 
18
airplanes must include such features described 
19
in subsection (a) as the Administrator deter-
20
mines appropriate; and 
21
(B) require air carriers to implement such 
22
air carrier practices and procedures described

in subsection (a) as the Administrator deter-
24
mines appropriate.

(2) EXCEPTION.—Notwithstanding paragraph 
1
(1), the Administrator may decline to initiate a rule-
