A BILL 
To cap the emissions of greenhouse gases through a require-
ment to purchase carbon permits, to distribute the pro-
ceeds of such purchases to eligible individuals, and for 
other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

The Congress finds the following: 
7
01:20 Apr 11, 2019
H1960
2 
•HR 1960 IH
(1) Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas 
1
emissions continue to rise. 
2
(2) The warming of our planet has led to more 
3
frequent, dangerous and expensive extreme weather 
4
events, including heat waves, storms, fires, droughts, 
5
floods and tornadoes. 
6
(3) A 2018 report by the Intergovernmental 
7
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recommends that 
8
serious efforts be made to limit global warming to 
9
1.5°C, which would require that CO2 emissions fall 
10
by 45 percent below 2010 levels by 2030, which 
11
would be equivalent to approximately 50 percent 
12
below 2005 levels by 2030. 
13
(4) The atmosphere is a common resource that 
14
belongs equally to all. 
15
(5) Stabilizing the climate can and must be 
16
done in a way that supports vibrant economic 
17
growth and a thriving middle class. 
18
(6) Legislation to address climate change and 
19
accelerate the transition to a clean energy economy 
20
must be fair, transparent and built to last.
