A BILL 
To amend the Small Business Act and the Small Business 
Investment Act of 1958 to increase access to capital 
for small business concerns that are manufacturers. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Strengthening Invest-
4
ment to Grow Manufacturing in America Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 3730 IH
(1) 
Manufacturers 
contributed 
over 
1
$2,330,000,000,000 to the United States economy 
2
in the first quarter of 2018 and accounted for 12 
3
percent of United States gross domestic product in 
4
2017. 
5
(2) Manufacturing is one of the most important 
6
sectors of the United States economy with respect to 
7
employment. In 2013, the manufacturing sector sup-
8
ported over 17,000,000 indirect jobs in the United 
9
States, in addition to the 12,000,000 individuals 
10
who were directly employed in manufacturing. Com-
11
bined, these indirect and direct manufacturing jobs 
12
represented more than 20 percent of United States 
13
employment in 2013—more than any other sector. 
14
(3) While the United States has added over 
15
14,000,000 non-farm jobs since 2010, manufac-
16
turing job growth has lagged and added only ap-
17
proximately 900,000 jobs. Post-recession job recov-
18
ery averages since the 1940s indicate that another 
19
1,200,000 manufacturing jobs should have been cre-
20
ated during this period. 
21
(4) Small manufacturers are the backbone of 
22
the United States manufacturing industry, account-
23
ing for nearly half of all manufacturing jobs in the 
24
United States. Ensuring that small manufacturers 
25

•HR 3730 IH
have adequate access to capital is critical to creating 
1
manufacturing jobs and the growth of the United 
2
States economy. 
3
(5) The 2015 Federal Reserve Small Business 
4
Credit Survey indicates that of the 52 percent of 
5
manufacturers that applied for financing during the 
6
survey period, 65 percent did so to expand their 
7
business or to pursue a new business opportunity. 
8
The survey also indicates that 42 percent of manu-
9
facturers received less financing than they requested, 
10
the primary result of which was delayed expansion 
11
of their business. 
12
(6) The loan guarantee programs of the Small 
13
Business Administration under section 7(a) of the 
14
Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 636(a)) and title V 
15
of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 (15 
16
U.S.C. 695 et seq.) encourage lenders to provide 
17
loans to creditworthy small businesses that would 
18
not otherwise obtain financing on reasonable terms 
19
and conditions and can serve as an excellent mecha-
20
nism by which to increase the availability of afford-
21
able credit to small manufacturers in the United 
22
States.
