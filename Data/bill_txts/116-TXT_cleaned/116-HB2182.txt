To establish certain duties for pharmacies to ensure provision 
of Food and Drug Administration-approved contracep-
tion, medication related to contraception, and for other

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Access to Birth Control 
4
Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds as follows:

•HR 2182 IH
(1) Family planning is basic health care. Access 
1
to contraception helps prevent unintended pregnancy 
2
and control the timing and spacing of planned 
3
births. 
4
(2) As a result of the enactment of the Patient 
5
Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law 
6
111–148), nearly 62,800,000 women now have cov-
7
erage of the full range of Food and Drug Adminis-
8
tration-approved contraceptive methods without cost 
9
sharing. 
10
(3) The Patient Protection and Affordable Care 
11
Act saved women $1,400,000,000 on birth control 
12
pills alone in 2013. 
13
(4) Nearly 2⁄3 of women of reproductive age are 
14
currently using a contraceptive method. 
15
(5) Although the Centers for Disease Control 
16
and Prevention included family planning in its pub-
17
lished list of the Ten Great Public Health Achieve-
18
ments in the 20th Century, the United States still 
19
has one of the highest rates of unintended preg-
20
nancies among industrialized nations. 
21
(6) Each year, 2,800,000 pregnancies, nearly 
22
half of all pregnancies, in the United States are un-
23
intended, and nearly half of unintended pregnancies 
24
end in abortion.

•HR 2182 IH
(7) Access to contraceptives at no cost has been 
1
found to contribute to significantly lower rates of 
2
unintended pregnancy and abortion. 
3
(8) Women who do not use contraception, 
4
women who have gaps in contraception, and women 
5
who use contraception inconsistently or incorrectly 
6
account for 95 percent of unintended pregnancies in 
7
the United States. 
8
(9) Prescription contraceptives are used for a 
9
range of medical purposes in addition to birth con-
10
trol, such as regulation of cycles and endometriosis. 
11
(10) The Food and Drug Administration has 
12
approved emergency contraception as safe and effec-
13
tive in preventing unintended pregnancy and has ap-
14
proved over-the-counter access to some forms of 
15
emergency contraception for all individuals, regard-
16
less of age. If taken soon after unprotected sex or 
17
primary contraceptive failure, emergency contracep-
18
tion can significantly reduce a woman’s chance of 
19
unintended pregnancy. 
20
(11) Legal contraception is a protected funda-
21
mental right in the United States and should not be 
22
impeded by one individual’s personal beliefs.

24
scriptions for contraceptives or provide emergency
