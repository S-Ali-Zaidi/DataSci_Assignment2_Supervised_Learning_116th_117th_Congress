A BILL 
To amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for 
public health research and investment into understanding 
and eliminating structural racism and police violence. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Anti-Racism in Public

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress makes the following findings: 
7
(1) For centuries, structural racism, defined by

and Culture as an ‘‘overarching system of racial bias 
1
across institutions and society,’’ in the United States 
2
has negatively affected communities of color, espe-
3
cially Black, Latinx, Asian American, Pacific Is-
4
lander, and American Indian and Alaska Native peo-
5
ple, to expand and reinforce white supremacy. 
6
(2) Structural racism determines the conditions 
7
in which people are born, grow, work, live, and age 
8
and determine people’s access to quality housing, 
9
education, food, transportation, and political power, 
10
and other social determinants of health. 
11
(3) Structural racism serves as a major barrier 
12
to achieving health equity and eliminating racial and 
13
ethnic inequities in health outcomes that exist at 
14
alarming rates and are determined by a wider set of 
15
forces and systems. 
16
(4) Due to structural racism in the United 
17
States, people of color are more likely to suffer from 
18
chronic health conditions (such as heart disease, dia-
19
betes, asthma, hepatitis, and hypertension) and in-
20
fectious diseases (such as HIV/AIDS, and COVID– 
21
19) compared to their white counterparts. 
22
(5) Due to structural racism in maternal health 
23
care in the United States, Black and American In-
24
dian and Alaska Native infants are more than twice 
25

as likely to die than white infants, Black women are 
1
3 to 4 times more likely to die from pregnancy-re-
2
lated causes than white women, and American In-
3
dian and Alaska Native women are 5 times more 
4
likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than 
5
white women. This trend persists even when adjust-
6
ing for income and education. 
7
(6) Due to structural racism in the United 
8
States, Non-Hispanic Black women have the highest 
9
rates for 22 of 25 severe morbidity indicators used 
10
by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention 
11
(CDC). 
12
(7) Due to structural racism in the United 
13
States, people of color comprise a disproportionate 
14
percentage of persons with disabilities in the United 
15
States. 
16
(8) Due to structural racism in the United 
17
States, Black men are up to three and a half times 
18
as likely to be killed by police as white men, and 1 
19
in every 1,000 Black men will die as a result of po-
20
lice violence. Policing has adverse effects on mental 
21
health in Black communities. 
22
(9) Due to the confluence of structural racism 
23
and factors such as gender, class, and sexual ori-
24
entation or gender identity, commonly referred to as 
25

•HR 8178 IH
intersectionality, Black and Latinx transgender 
1
women are more likely to die due to violence and 
2
homicide than their white counterparts. 
3
(10) Due to structural racism, inequitable ac-
4
cess to quality health care and longterm services and 
5
supports also disproportionately burdens commu-
6
nities of color; people of color and immigrants are 
7
less likely to be insured and are more likely to live 
8
in medically underserved areas. 
9
(11) Due to structural racism, older adults of 
10
color are also more likely to be admitted to nursing 
11
homes and assisted living facilities and to reside in 
12
those of poor quality, and when older adults of color 
13
do receive home and community based services, Med-
14
icaid spends less money on their services and they 
15
are more likely to be hospitalized than older white 
16
adults. 
17
(12) In addition, the Federal Government’s fail-
18
ure to honor the unique political status of American 
19
Indian and Alaska Native people, to respect the in-
20
herent sovereignty of Tribal Nations, and to uphold 
21
its trust and treaty obligations to Tribal Nations 
22
and American Indian and Alaska Native people, is 
23
an ongoing and unjust manifestation of centuries of 
24

oppression, with the consequence of adverse health 
1
outcomes for Native peoples. 
2
(13) The COVID–19 pandemic has exposed the 
3
devastating impact of structural racism on the 
4
United States’ ability to ensure equitable health out-
5
comes for people of color, and made these commu-
6
nities more likely to suffer from severe outcomes due 
7
to the coronavirus infection. 
8
(14) Racial and ethnic inequity in public health 
9
is a result of systematic, personally mediated, and 
10
internalized racism and racist public and private 
11
policies and practices, and dismantling structural 
12
racism is integral to addressing public health. 
13
