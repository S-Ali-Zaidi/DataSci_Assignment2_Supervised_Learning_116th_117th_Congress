color, religion, national origin, age, disability, genetic

information, and uniformed services status; 
2
(3) Congress enacted title VII of the Civil 
3
Rights Act of 1964 intending to provide broad pro-
4
tection from many forms of bias in the workplace; 
5
(4) the Supreme Court has recognized in City 
6
of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power v. 
7
Manhart, 435 U.S. 702 (1978), that the protection 
8
against sex discrimination in the terms, conditions, 
9
or privileges of employment under title VII of the 
10
Civil Rights Act of 1964 reflects Congress’ intent to 
11
‘‘strike at the entire spectrum’’ of sex-based dis-
12
crimination in employment; 
13
(5) in 1980, the Equal Employment Oppor-
14
tunity Commission (referred to in this section as 
15
‘‘the Commission’’) amended its Guidelines on Dis-
16
crimination Because of Sex (referred to in this sec-
17
tion as ‘‘the Guidelines’’) to specify that sexual har-
18
assment is a form of sex discrimination prohibited 
19
by title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; 
20
(6) in the Guidelines, the Commission explained 
21
that harassing conduct is unlawful where— 
22
(A) ‘‘submission to such conduct is made 
23
either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition 
24
of an individual’s employment’’; 
25
22:25 Apr 16, 2019
H2148
46 
•HR 2148 IH
(B) ‘‘submission to or rejection of such 
1
conduct by an individual is used as the basis for 
2
employment decisions’’; or 
3
(C) the conduct ‘‘has the purpose or effect 
4
of unreasonably interfering with an individual’s 
5
work performance or creating an intimidating, 
6
hostile, or offensive working environment’’; 
7
(7) the Commission further explained that, with 
8
respect to the evidence required to support a finding 
9
of unlawful harassment, it ‘‘will look at the record 
10
as a whole and at the totality of the circumstances, 
11
such as the nature of the sexual advances and the 
12
context in which the alleged incidents occurred’’ and 
13
emphasized that the ‘‘determination of the legality of 
14
a particular action will be made from the facts, on 
15
a case by case basis’’; 
16
(8) six years later, the Supreme Court in 
17
Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57 
18
(1986), recognized that the protections under title 
19
VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 are not limited 
20
to discrimination that causes ‘‘economic’’ or ‘‘tan-
21
gible’’ loss, and held that the phrase ‘‘terms, condi-
22
tions, or privileges of employment’’ in title VII of 
23
such Act is an ‘‘expansive concept that sweeps with-
24
in its protective ambit’’ the practice of creating a

hostile work environment based on discrimination in 
1
the form of harassment; 
2
(9) in reaching this conclusion in the Meritor 
3
decision, the Supreme Court cited and approved the 
4
Guidelines; 
5
(10) in the Meritor decision, the Supreme Court

cited with approval lower court decisions that con-
7
cluded that a hostile work environment based on

race, religion, or national origin violates the prohibi-

tion of discrimination in the terms, conditions, or

•HR 2148 IH
1964, in the Meritor decision, the Supreme Court 
1
noted that harassment would be actionable when it 
2
is ‘‘sufficiently severe or pervasive ‘to alter the con-
3
ditions of [the victim’s] employment and create an 
4
abusive working environment’ ’’ (quoting Rogers v. 
5
EEOC, 454 F.2d 234 (5th Cir. 1971)); 
6
(12) in Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc., 510 
7
U.S. 17 (1993), the Supreme Court clarified that 
8
harassment need not seriously affect an employee’s 
9
psychological well-being or lead the employee to suf-
10
fer injury in order to be unlawful, but rather, need 
11
merely create a work environment that a reasonable 
12
person in the protected class would find hostile or 
13
abusive; 
14
(13) in Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc., the Su-
15
preme Court held that whether a work environment 
16
is unlawfully hostile or abusive does not depend on 
17
any mathematically precise test, but rather, is to be 
18
determined by looking at all of the circumstances, 
19
with no single factor required; 
20
(14) in National Railroad Passenger Corp. v. 
21
Morgan, 536 U.S. 101 (2002), the Supreme Court 
22
reaffirmed the Harris decision and further held that 
23
the hostility or abusiveness of each harassing act 
24
should be considered in the aggregate, not in isola-
25

•HR 2148 IH
tion, regardless of whether such acts occur over days 
1
or even years; 
2
(15) notwithstanding the rulings of the Su-
3
preme Court specified in this subsection, some lower 
4
court decisions have treated harassing conduct’s se-
5
verity or pervasiveness as the only 2 relevant factors 
6
in evaluating whether such conduct violates title VII 
7
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; 
8
(16) some lower court decisions have treated 
9
‘‘severe or pervasive’’ as a threshold for liability, 
10
when the relevant inquiry is whether the harassing 
11
conduct actually altered the terms, conditions, or 
12
privileges of employment; 
13
(17) some lower court decisions further have in-
14
terpreted the ‘‘severe or pervasive’’ language in the 
15
Meritor decision so narrowly as to recognize only the 
16
most egregious conduct as unlawful, despite Con-
17
gress’ intent that title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 
18
1964 afford a broad scope of protection from dis-
19
crimination;

leges of employment, with no single type, frequency,

or duration of conduct required to make a showing
