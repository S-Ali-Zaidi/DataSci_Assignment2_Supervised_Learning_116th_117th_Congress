SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

transmission of such virus by individuals who do not 
1
show symptoms. 
2
(2) The Government has an interest in encour-
3
aging the use of face coverings in public and each 
4
place of business to protect the health of populations 
5
that are at a higher risk of developing severe illness 
6
from COVID–19, including— 
7
(A) the immunocompromised; 
8
(B) individuals who are 65 years of age or 
9
older; and 
10
(C) individuals living with chronic lung dis-
11
ease, moderate to severe asthma, serious heart 
12
conditions, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, se-
13
vere obesity, or liver disease. 
14
(3) Overwhelming scientific evidence has shown 
15
that face coverings block a high portion of res-
16
piratory droplets that spread the virus that causes 
17
COVID–19. 
18
(4) Evidence from an international cross-dis-
19
ciplinary review of scientific research has shown 
20
that— 
21
(A) using a face covering in public is most 
22
effective at reducing the spread of COVID–19 
23
when compliance is high; and

(B) transmission in a community is sub-
1
stantially lower when individuals are required to 
2
use a face covering or where the use of a face 
3
covering is widespread. 
4
(5) The widespread use of face coverings sub-
5
stantially reduces the number of fatalities, the cases 
6
of severe illness, and continued economic losses that 
7
result from transmission of the virus that causes 
8
COVID–19. 
9
(6) The widespread use of face coverings is nec-
10
essary (but not sufficient) to slow the spread of the 
11
virus that causes COVID–19 and should be pro-
12
moted along with regular handwashing, social 
13
distancing, testing, and minimizing nonessential ac-
14
tivities outside of the household.
