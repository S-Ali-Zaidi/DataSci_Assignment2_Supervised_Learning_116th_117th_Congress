(1) The mission of the Financial Crimes En-
1
forcement Network (FinCEN) is to safeguard the fi-
2
nancial system from illicit use and combat money 
3
laundering and promote national security through 
4
the collection, analysis, and dissemination of finan-
5
cial intelligence and strategic use of financial au-
6
thorities. 
7
(2) In its mission to safeguard the financial 
8
system from the abuses of financial crime, including 
9
terrorist financing, money laundering and other il-
10
licit activity, the United States should prioritize 
11
working with partners in Federal, State, local, Trib-
12
al, and foreign law enforcement authorities.

(3) The Federal Bureau of Investigation has 
14
stated that since the terror attacks on September 
15
11, 2001, ‘‘The threat landscape has expanded con-
16
siderably, though it is important to note that the 
17
more traditional threat posed by al Qaeda and its af-
18
filiates is still present and active. The threat of do-
19
mestic terrorism also remains persistent overall, with 
20
actors crossing the line from First Amendment pro-
21
tected rights to committing crimes to further their 
22
political agenda.’’. 
23
(4) Although the use and trading of virtual cur-
24
rencies are legal practices, some terrorists and crimi-

seek to exploit vulnerabilities in the global financial

system and are increasingly using emerging payment 
3
methods such as virtual currencies to move illicit

funds.

(5) In carrying out its mission, FinCEN should

prioritize all forms of terrorism and emerging meth-

ods of terrorism and illicit finance.
