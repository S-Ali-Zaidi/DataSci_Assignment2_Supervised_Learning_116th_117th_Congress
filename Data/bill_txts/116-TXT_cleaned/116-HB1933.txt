SEC. 3. SMALL BUSINESS REMOTE SELLER EXEMPTION. 
1
In the case of a sale made by a small business remote 
2
seller, no State may impose a sales tax collection duty on 
3
any person other than the purchaser if the sale is made 
4
on or after June 21, 2018, and before the date that is 
5
30 days after the date on which the States develop and 
6
Congress approves an interstate compact, applicable to the 
7
State and sale, governing the imposition of tax collection 
8
duties on remote sellers. 
9
SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
10
It is the sense of Congress that the States should de-
11
velop an interstate compact for the collection of sales tax 
12
by remote sellers that identifies a clearly defined minimum 
13
substantial nexus between the remote seller and the taxing 
14
State, that simplifies registration, collection, remittance, 
15
auditing, and other compliance processes to the greatest 
16
extent possible in order to avoid undue burdens on inter-
17
state commerce, and that, due to such simplification, 
18
eliminates the need for the continuation of the small busi-
19
ness remote seller exemption under section 4.
