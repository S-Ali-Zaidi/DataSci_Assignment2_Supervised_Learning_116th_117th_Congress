of current students are students of color while only

18 percent of teachers are of color, according to a

2016 study by the Brookings Institution.

‘‘(2) A 2016 report conducted by the Depart-
4
ment of Education shows that teachers of color tend 
5
to provide more culturally relevant teaching and bet-
6
ter understand the situations that students of color 
7
may face. These factors help in the development of 
8
trusting teacher-student relationships. Researchers 
9
from Vanderbilt University also found that greater 
10
racial and ethnic diversity in the principal corps ben-
11
efits students, especially students of color.

‘‘(3) Teachers and school leaders of color can

also serve as cultural ambassadors who help stu-

positive impacts on student educational experiences 
18
and outcomes. Students of color demonstrate greater 
19
academic achievement and social-emotional develop-
