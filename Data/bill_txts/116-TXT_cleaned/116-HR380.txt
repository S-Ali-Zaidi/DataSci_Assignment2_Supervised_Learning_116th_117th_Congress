RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the designation of the week of May 
13 through May 20, 2019, as Infrastructure Week. 
Whereas the term ‘‘infrastructure’’ generally refers to long- 
lived, capital-intensive systems and facilities, such as 
freight and passenger highways, aviation, railroads, water 
resources development, and telecommunications systems 
and facilities; 
Whereas according to business, labor, and local-elected offi-
cials, to address the backlog of unmet capital investment 
needs, our current needs, and to prepare the Nation’s 
roads, bridges, and transit systems for increased usage in 
the decades ahead, we must increase infrastructure in-
vestment by $2 trillion by 2025; 
Whereas every $1 invested in infrastructure generates $3.70 
in economic growth;

Whereas Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor is the busiest rail line 
in North America, with approximately 2,200 Amtrak, 
commuter, and freight trains operating in the Corridor 
daily; 
Whereas without infrastructure investment, 30 percent of rail 
miles in primary corridors will be operating above capac-
ity by 2035, causing severe congestion that will affect 
every region of the United States and potentially shift 
freight to the Nation’s already heavily congested highway 
system; 
Whereas highway congestion adds nearly $75 billion to the 
cost of freight transportation annually; 
Whereas the cost of bringing the Nation’s rail transit and 
bus systems into a state of good repair is estimated at 
$90 billion; 
Whereas 44 percent of major roadways are in poor or medi-
ocre condition, costing the average driver $533 each year 
in repairs; 
Whereas according to its most recent Clean Watersheds 
Needs Survey, the Environmental Protection Agency re-
ports that the total capital cost of meeting the Nation’s 
wastewater and stormwater treatment needs over the 
next 25 years is $271 billion; 
Whereas over $200 billion in economic activity can be gen-
erated by closing the water infrastructure gap; 
Whereas United States airports support more than 9.6 mil-
lion jobs; 
Whereas United States airports have an estimated $100 bil-
lion in infrastructure investment need through 2021 to 
accommodate passenger and cargo growth;

Whereas, by 2025, the projected shortfall in United States 
airport infrastructure investment may cause the loss of 
nearly 257,000 jobs and $337 billion in lost gross domes-
tic product (GDP); 
Whereas every billion dollars in Federal investment in infra-
structure supports 13,000 American jobs, and these jobs 
on average pay 30 percent more than comparable occupa-
tions; 
Whereas, in 2018, 77 percent of State and local infrastruc-
ture ballot measures were approved by votes; and 
Whereas the week of May 13 through May 20, 2019, is an 
appropriate week to designate as Infrastructure Week: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) celebrates the dedication and contributions 
2
of the contractors and small business owners that 
3
will take part in future infrastructure projects across 
4
the Nation; 
5
(2) supports the goal of thoroughly drafting 
6
and expediently submitting a transportation and in-
7
frastructure plan to build the Nation’s roads; 
8
(3) commits to engaging diverse contractors in 
9
future infrastructure projects; and 
10
(4) calls upon the people of the United States 
11
to observe Infrastructure Week with appropriate ad-
12
vocacy, programs, and activities.
