SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Artificial intelligence is a tool that has the 
3
potential to change and possibly transform every 
4
sector of the United States economy and society. 
5
(2) The Federal Government should continue to 
6
play an important role advancing research, develop-
7
ment, standards, and education activities in artificial 
8
intelligence through coordination and collaboration 
9
between government, academia, and the private sec-
10
tor to leverage the intellectual, physical, and digital 
11
resources of each stakeholder. 
12
(3) The Federal Government lacks clear under-
13
standing of the capabilities of artificial intelligence 
14
23:31 Mar 25, 2020
H6216

•HR 6216 IH
and its potential to affect various social and eco-
1
nomic sectors, including ethical concerns, national 
2
security implications, and workforce impacts. 
3
(4) Researchers from academia, Federal labora-
4
tories, and much of the private sector have limited 
5
access to many high-quality datasets, computing re-
6
sources, or real-world testing environments to design 
7
and deploy safe and trustworthy artificial intel-
8
ligence systems. 
9
(5) There is a lack of standards and 
10
benchmarking for artificial intelligence systems that 
11
academia and the public and private sectors can use 
12
to evaluate the performance of these systems before 
13
and after deployment. 
14
(6) Artificial intelligence is increasingly becom-
15
ing a highly interdisciplinary field with expertise re-
16
quired from a diverse range of scientific and other 
17
scholarly disciplines that traditionally work inde-
18
pendently and continue to face cultural and institu-
19
tional barriers to large scale collaboration. 
20
(7) Current Federal investments and funding 
21
mechanisms are largely insufficient to incentivize 
22
and support the large-scale interdisciplinary and 
23
public-private collaborations that will be required to 
24
23:31 Mar 25, 2020
H6216
4 
•HR 6216 IH
advance trustworthy artificial intelligence systems in 
1
the United States. 
2
(8) The United States education pipeline for ar-
3
tificial intelligence fields faces significant challenges. 
4
Not only does the artificial intelligence research field 
5
lack the gender and racial diversity of the American 
6
population as a whole, but it is failing to both retain 
7
researchers and adequately support educators to 
8
meet the demands of the next generation of students 
9
studying artificial intelligence. 
10
(9) In order to help drive forward advances in 
11
trustworthy artificial intelligence across all sectors 
12
and to the benefit of all Americans, the Federal 
13
Government must provide sufficient resources and 
14
use its convening power to facilitate the growth of 
15
artificial intelligence human capital, research, and 
16
innovation capacity in academia and other nonprofit 
17
research organizations, companies of all sizes and 
18
across all sectors, and within the Federal Govern-
19
ment.
