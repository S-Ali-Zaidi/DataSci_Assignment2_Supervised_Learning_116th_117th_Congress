A BILL 
To amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to provide 
States an option to cover a children’s program of all- 
inclusive coordinated care (ChiPACC) under Medicaid 
program. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

Congress finds that—

(1) serious illnesses and health conditions that 
1
are potentially life-threatening place significant 
2
stress on both the child and family; 
3
(2) palliative care relieves children’s symptoms 
4
such as pain, fatigue, anxiety, nausea, and sleep 
5
problems, and may be provided at any age or stage 
6
of serious illness, and has been shown to enhance 
7
the quality of life for both the child and family; 
8
(3) under the existing model under the Med-
9
icaid program under title XIX of the Social Security 
10
Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.), eligible children diag-
11
nosed with potentially life-limiting illnesses are lim-
12
ited to receiving hospice services only after they have 
13
been given a prognosis of six months to live. There 
14
remain many critical barriers to end-of-life care 
15
under the current health care system, including re-
16
luctance of medical professionals and families to ac-
17
knowledge a limited life expectancy; 
18
(4) such model offers discrete services, which 
19
can be difficult to navigate, while the qualifications 
20
for coverage under the Medicaid program can block 
21
access to critical care; 
22
(5) the Children’s Program of All-inclusive Co-
23
ordinated Care (referred to in this Act as 
24
‘‘ChiPACC’’) provides all-inclusive care for children 
25

with life-threatening conditions and their families 
1
from the time of diagnosis and— 
2
(A) fills a gap in coverage under the Med-
3
icaid program of integrated, multi-disciplinary 
4
services that are reasonable and necessary for 
5
the palliation and management of seriously ill 
6
children; 
7
(B) serves a population that includes chil-
8
dren who are not yet hospice eligible; and 
9
(C) provides greater coordination of pallia-
10
tive and curative services for children through-
11
out the course of their illness or condition, 
12
which may begin at the time of diagnosis; 
13
(6) some States have opted to provide services 
14
targeted to this population through waivers under 
15
subsections (b) and (c) of section 1915 of the Social 
16
Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396n), each of which re-
17
quires the approval of the Centers for Medicare & 
18
Medicaid Services of the initial waiver application 
19
and any subsequent renewal of such waiver; 
20
(7) since 2005, the Secretary of Health and 
21
Human Services has approved home and community- 
22
based service waivers under section 1915(c) of such 
23
Act (42 U.S.C. 1396n(c)) to operate ChiPACC in 
24
five States;

•HR 9002 IH
(8) in States operating ChiPACC under such a 
1
waiver— 
2
(A) the respective State’s Medicaid pro-
3
gram achieved significant cost savings through 
4
a reduction in inpatient care and an increase in 
5
less expensive outpatient care; 
6
(B) access to such services in such States 
7
reduced more costly utilizations of other serv-
8
ices; and 
9
(C) services provided through ChiPACC 
10
are less costly to the State’s Medicaid program 
11
because ChiPACC facilitates children receiving 
12
palliative care at home rather than receiving 
13
such services in an inpatient hospital setting; 
14
and 
15
(9) allowing States the option to implement 
16
ChiPACC through a State plan amendment would— 
17
(A) give States the ability to make such 
18
program a part of a State’s Medicaid program 
19
while avoiding the lengthy waiver process; and 
20
(B) give States the flexibility to establish 
21
and design its program to fit the needs of the 
22
respective State.
