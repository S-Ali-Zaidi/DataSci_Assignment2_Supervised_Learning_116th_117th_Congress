SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 4397 IH
(1) Millions of older individuals and individuals 
1
with disabilities in the United States require assist-
2
ance with activities of daily living to live independ-
3
ently and participate in their communities to their 
4
fullest extent. The Bureau of the Census projects 
5
that by 2060 the population of individuals age 65 or 
6
older will double from 49,200,000 in 2016 to 
7
94,700,000. According to the Centers for Disease 
8
Control and Prevention, 1 in 4 (or 60,000,000) 
9
adults in the United States are living with a dis-
10
ability. 
11
(2) The assistance of direct care workers allows 
12
older individuals and individuals with disabilities to 
13
live with dignity and safety, and to exercise their 
14
right to live independently in their own homes and 
15
communities, in keeping with what is most appro-
16
priate for their needs and preferences. Older individ-
17
uals and individuals with disabilities may also par-
18
ticipate in the direct care workforce, further sup-
19
porting their ability to live independently. 
20
(3) According to PHI, direct care workers pro-
21
vide most of the paid, hands-on care for older indi-
22
viduals and individuals with disabilities. 
23
(4) According to PHI, 4,500,000 direct care 
24
workers provide care across home and community- 
25
23:36 Sep 20, 2019

•HR 4397 IH
based settings, nursing facilities, assisted living fa-
1
cilities, group homes, intermediate care facilities, 
2
and hospitals to care for the growing population of 
3
older individuals and individuals with disabilities. 
4
(5) PHI projects that by 2024, 5,200,000 di-
5
rect care workers will be needed across all care set-
6
tings to care for the growing population of older in-
7
dividuals and individuals with disabilities. 
8
(6) Many direct care workers lack access to a 
9
career pathway or advanced training opportunities. 
10
This limits their ability to build competency and ex-
11
pertise in their field that, when gained, may lead to 
12
an increase in their earning capacity. According to 
13
PHI, more than half of home care workers have 
14
completed no formal education beyond high school, 
15
making high-quality, transferable training essential 
16
to success on the job. 
17
(7) As of 2015, the median wage for direct care 
18
workers is approximately $11 an hour; wages and 
19
earnings for home care workers are even lower in 
20
rural areas. Because of low wages, variable work 
21
hours, and the inability to access workplace-based 
22
benefits, 19 percent of home care workers live below 
23
the Federal poverty level as compared to 9 percent 
24
of the general United States workforce. Nearly half 
25
23:36 Sep 20, 2019
H4397
4 
•HR 4397 IH
of direct care workers rely on some form of public 
1
assistance to support themselves and their families. 
2
(8) According to PHI, approximately 9 in 10 
3
direct care workers are women, more than half are 
4
women of color, and one quarter of direct care work-
5
ers are immigrants. 
6
(9) The direct care workforce is plagued with 
7
high turnover, low job satisfaction, and workforce 
8
shortages. These conditions can contribute to re-
9
duced quality of care and threaten the availability of 
10
supports for older individuals and individuals with 
11
disabilities. 
12
(10) Because of the nature of the work, direct 
13
care workers suffer from disproportionately high 
14
rates of injury. In 2016, the injury rate for nursing 
15
assistants was 337 per 10,000 as compared to 100 
16
per 10,000 for other occupations. 
17
(11) Training has been shown to reduce worker 
18
turnover, reduce rates of injury, and lead to in-
19
creased job satisfaction. 
20
(12) The Institute of Medicine found that to 
21
ensure that the United States is prepared to meet 
22
the health care needs of older individuals during the 
23
21st century, it is essential that the capacity of the 
24
direct care workforce be enhanced in both the num-
