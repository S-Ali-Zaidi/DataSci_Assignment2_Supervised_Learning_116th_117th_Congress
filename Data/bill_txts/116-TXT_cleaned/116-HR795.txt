forces are bound to respect historical monuments so far 
as war allows; 
Whereas, following World War II, the 1954 Hague Conven-
tion for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event 
of Armed Conflict (‘‘Hague Convention’’), to which the 
United States is a party, requires that State Parties re-
frain from any act directed by way of reprisals against 
cultural property and solidified the principle that cultural 
property should not be targeted during conflict except in 
cases of imperative military necessity; 
Whereas, the most recent Department of Defense Law of 
War Manual, revised in 2016, specifically prohibits ‘‘acts 
of hostility . . . directed against cultural property’’ in 
the absence of imperative military necessity; 
Whereas, in 2004, the United Nations International Criminal 
Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia convicted those re-
sponsible for the intentional shelling of the Old City of 
Dubrovnik in Croatia, a World Heritage Site; 
Whereas the Protect and Preserve International Cultural 
Property Act (Public Law 114–151) advanced the protec-
tion of cultural property at risk from conflicts in Syria 
and elsewhere and established an interagency Cultural 
Heritage Coordinating Committee at the U.S. Depart-
ment of State; 
Whereas, in 2017, the United Nations Security Council con-
demned the unlawful destruction of cultural property in 
Resolution 2347, a resolution for which the United States 
voted, and affirmed that directing unlawful attacks 
against cultural sites and buildings may constitute a war 
crime;

protect international cultural property abroad, including
