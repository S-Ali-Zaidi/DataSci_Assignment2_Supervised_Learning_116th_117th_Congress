A BILL 
To expedite the provision of humanitarian assistance, includ-
ing life-saving medical care, to the people of North 
Korea, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Enhancing North

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress makes the following findings:

04:03 Jul 02, 2020
H7218
2 
•HR 7218 IH
(1) Providing humanitarian assistance, includ-
1
ing to countries subject to sanctions imposed by the 
2
United States, is an expression of American values 
3
that furthers United States interests around the 
4
world and is consistent with international humani-
5
tarian law. 
6
(2) As of February 2020, roughly 10,100,000 
7
people in North Korea are in urgent need of food as-
8
sistance and roughly 10,400,000 need nutrition sup-
9
port and improved access to basic services, including 
10
health care, water, sanitation, and hygiene facilities. 
11
(3) More than 40 percent of people in North 
12
Korea are undernourished, and 1 in 5 children in 
13
the country under the age of 5 is stunted in growth. 
14
(4) More than 1⁄3 of household drinking water 
15
in North Korea is contaminated. 
16
(5) Independent experts have identified severe 
17
deficiencies in North Korea’s public health infra-
18
structure, trained medical personnel, ability to com-
19
municate important safety information, and commit-
20
ment to addressing those deficiencies. 
21
(6) North Korea has one of the highest burdens 
22
of tuberculosis in the world and humanitarian assist-
23
ance is critical for countering the spread of deadly 
24
infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, 
25
04:03 Jul 02, 2020
H7218
3 
•HR 7218 IH
Hepatitis B, and the coronavirus disease 2019 (com-
1
monly known as ‘‘COVID–19’’). 
2
(7) North Korea cannot reliably maintain 
3
stocks of drugs to treat diseases such as tuberculosis 
4
and HIV/AIDS, posing the risk of interrupted treat-
5
ments, which can lead to treatment failures and de-
6
velopment of resistance to multiple therapies, mak-
7
ing treatment significantly more difficult and costly. 
8
(8) The spread of COVID–19 in North Korea 
9
would likely have devastating consequences for the 
10
people of that country who are especially vulnerable 
11
to a pandemic because of deficiencies in public 
12
health infrastructure. 
13
(9) While the Government of North Korea has 
14
not reported any cases of COVID–19 in the country, 
15
the extent and results of testing are unknown, and 
16
government officials have not historically been open 
17
or transparent about humanitarian emergencies fac-
18
ing the people of North Korea. 
19
(10) Responses to the COVID–19 crisis, includ-
20
ing border closings and quarantines that may extend 
21
through the planting season, have impeded inter-
22
national efforts that would otherwise be providing 
23
life-saving support to the people of North Korea.

•HR 7218 IH
(11) In its final report published on March 5, 
1
2019, the United Nations Panel of Experts on 
2
North Korea found that ‘‘United Nations agencies 
3
and humanitarian organizations continue to experi-
4
ence unintended consequences on their humanitarian 
5
programmes that make it impossible to operate nor-
6
mally in the Democratic People’s Republic of 
7
Korea.’’. 
8
(12) Barriers to humanitarian access can result 
9
from decisions made or delayed by the Government 
10
of North Korea, by the governments of other coun-
11
tries, including the governments of the United 
12
States and the People’s Republic of China, and by 
13
the Committee of the United Nations Security Coun-
14
cil established by United Nations Security Council 
15
Resolution 1718 (2006) (in this Act referred to as 
16
the ‘‘1718 Sanctions Committee’’). 
17
(13) Nongovernmental organizations that pro-
18
vide humanitarian assistance in North Korea must 
19
typically seek simultaneous authorizations from the 
20
Department of the Treasury, the Department of 
21
State, the Department of Commerce, the 1718 Sanc-
22
tions Committee, customs officials in the People’s 
23
Republic of China, and the Government of North 
24

•HR 7218 IH
Korea, adding further delays to humanitarian ac-
1
cess. 
2
(14) The 1718 Sanctions Committee issued the 
3
document entitled ‘‘Implementation Assistance No-
4
tice No. 7’’ on August 6, 2018, to clarify the process 
5
for granting requests for humanitarian exemptions 
6
by the United Nations and to reaffirm that sanc-
7
tions are not intended to have adverse humanitarian 
8
consequences for civilians in North Korea. 
9
(15) United States Government travel restric-
10
tions impede the access of United States employees 
11
of humanitarian organizations inside North Korea 
12
and can complicate the monitoring and evaluation 
13
procedures that nongovernmental organizations have 
14
used to ensure that aid reaches the most vulnerable 
15
populations. 
16
(16) Humanitarian exceptions in comprehensive 
17
sanctions programs, such as the exceptions under 
18
section 510.512 of the North Korea Sanctions Regu-
19
lations, are not effective unless the persons who pro-
20
vide assistance along with their financial institu-
21
tions, suppliers, shippers, and other entities can 
22
make practical use of the exceptions. 
23
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
24
It is the sense of Congress that— 
25
04:03 Jul 02, 2020
H7218
6 
•HR 7218 IH
(1) national governments and multilateral au-
1
thorities must take action to mitigate documented 
2
delays and ensure that sanctions imposed with re-
3
spect to North Korea do not hinder efforts to pro-
4
vide humanitarian relief, including life-saving med-
5
ical care, to the people of North Korea; 
6
(2) the Department of the Treasury should pro-
7
vide timely and meaningful responses to requests for 
8
specific licenses given that humanitarian organiza-
9
tions typically have a limited time to execute 
10
projects that must be approved by multiple United 
11
States Government agencies and foreign govern-
12
ments; 
13
(3) because humanitarian assistance is unlikely 
14
to enable large-scale sanctions evasion and revenue 
15
generation, sanctions enforcement should focus on 
16
ongoing North Korean activities, including ship-to- 
17
ship transfers of coal and other goods, cyberattacks, 
18
and the use of forced labor abroad, all highlighted 
19
in reports issued by the United Nations Panel of Ex-
20
perts on North Korea and other authoritative 
21
sources; and 
22
(4) financial institutions should recognize and 
23
consider the reputational and practical costs of im-
