SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Under the previous administration, FEMA’s 
3
2014–2018 Strategic Plan explicitly mentioned and 
4
referenced climate change as a source of changing 
5
and increasing national disaster risks, in the near 
6
and long term, that— 
7
(A) must be effectively integrated into the 
8
Agency’s risk assessment resources and proc-
9
esses; and 
10
(B) the entire emergency management 
11
community will need to adapt appropriately to 
12
as they strengthen their risk management pro-
13
grams. 
14
(2) In FEMA’s 2018–2022 Strategic Plan, de-
15
spite the mounting threat posed by climate change, 
16
the term ‘‘climate change’’ is entirely absent from 
17
the text. 
18
(3) It is the general consensus of the global sci-
19
entific community that— 
20
(A) the evidence of climate change is un-
21
equivocal; 
22
(B) anthropogenic greenhouse gas emis-
23
sions are the primary cause of climate change; 
24
and 
25
21:27 Oct 29, 2019
H4823
3 
•HR 4823 IH
(C) as a direct result of climate change, 
1
sea levels are rising and extreme weather events 
2
are becoming more commonplace and severe. 
3
(4) The last 5 years have been the warmest 
4
years on record since the National Oceanic and At-
5
mospheric Administration began recording global air 
6
temperatures in 1895. 
7
(5) 2017, one of the three warmest years on 
8
record, was also the most expensive year on record 
9
for emergency disaster costs in the United States 
10
due to 16 weather and climate disasters. 
11
(6) It is the mission of FEMA to reduce the 
12
loss of life and property and protect our institutions 
13
from all hazards by leading and supporting the Na-
14
tion in a comprehensive, risk-based emergency man-
15
agement program of mitigation, preparedness, re-
16
sponse, and recovery. 
17
(7) It is detrimental to the mission of FEMA, 
18
and the Agency’s ability to follow its mandate, to ex-
19
plicitly or implicitly deny or ignore the existence of 
20
climate change or the implications of such on na-
21
tional security and national emergency management. 
22
(8) To fully and effectively carry out its man-
23
date, FEMA must comprehensively assess and incor-
24
porate the current and future natural disaster risks
