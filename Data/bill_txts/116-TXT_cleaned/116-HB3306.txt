9
cordance with legal restrictions regarding foreign ob-
10
ligations relating to the beginning stage of the nu-
11
clear fuel cycle; 
12
(2) many domestic advanced nuclear power in-
13
dustry participants require access to high-assay, low- 
14
enriched uranium fuel for— 
15
(A) initial fuel testing; 
16
(B) operation of demonstration reactors;

and

19
clear reactors;

22
pability exists for uranium fuel enriched to greater 
23
than 5 weight percent of the uranium-235 isotope;

of the National Nuclear Security Administra-

(1) nuclear power plants— 
3
(A) generate billions of dollars in national 
4
economic 
activity 
through 
procurements 
5
throughout the United States; and 
6
(B) provide tens of thousands of people in 
7
the United States with high-paying jobs, con-
8
tributing substantially to the local economies of 
9
the communities in which the plants operate; 
10
(2) the world market for the growth of commer-
11
cial nuclear power was estimated by the Department 
12
of 
Commerce 
to 
be 
valued 
at 
up 
to 
13
$740,000,000,000 during the period of calendar 
14
years 2018 through 2028; 
15
(3) the participation and leadership of the 
16
United States in the market described in paragraph 
17
(2) will— 
18
(A)(i) increase economic activity in the 
19
United States through robust nuclear exports, 
20
leading to the enhanced economic security of 
21
the United States; and 
22
(ii) preserve and enhance the ability of the 
23
United States to positively influence inter-
24

proliferation standards through commercial en-
1
gagement with other nations; but

(B) require significant investment in

nologies; 
5
(4) in order to lead the world in the next gen-
6
eration of commercial nuclear power, the advanced 
7
nuclear industry in the United States should be posi-
8
tioned for accelerated growth, which requires public- 
9
private partnerships between industry entities and 
10
the Federal Government; 
11
(5) success in achieving the goals described in 
12
this subsection will require a whole-government Fed-
13
eral approach that focuses on the shared needs and 
14
individual mission requirements of, at a minimum—
