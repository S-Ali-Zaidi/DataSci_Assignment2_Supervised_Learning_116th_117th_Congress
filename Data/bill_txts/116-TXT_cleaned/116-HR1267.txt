RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
Congress must pass a pandemic excess profits tax on 
large corporations who have achieved windfall profits due 
to the COVID–19 public health crisis. 
Whereas big technology corporations and big box retailers will 
emerge from the coronavirus crisis stronger than ever be-
fore, and with a greater economic advantage over smaller 
businesses; 
Whereas at a time when small businesses and Americans 
across the country are suffering catastrophic economic 
consequences due to the COVID–19 pandemic and gov-
ernment-mandated restrictions, certain corporations such

as Amazon, Walmart, Zoom, and others have seen wind-
fall profits due to the pandemic; 
Whereas ninety-nine percent of all businesses in the United 
States are small businesses, accounting for forty-four 
percent of the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP), em-
ploying forty-seven percent of our country’s workforce; 
Whereas according to a December national survey assessing 
the pandemic’s economic impact to small business, one- 
in-four small businesses will have to close their doors in 
the next six months if current economic conditions don’t 
improve; 
Whereas large technology companies like Amazon, Alphabet, 
Apple, and Facebook posted record profits during the 
COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas it would be neither fair nor good for the United 
States economy for large corporations who have gained a 
competitive advantage over small businesses due to gov-
ernment-mandated restrictions, to maintain such a com-
petitive advantage in the post-pandemic economy; 
Whereas given most Americans and small businesses are 
struggling or shutting their doors while big corporations 
are seeing a windfall of excess profits due to the crisis, 
it is time to reinstate the wartime excess profits tax that 
was used during WWI and WWII to prevent certain cor-
porations from crisis profiteering and opportunistically 
enriching themselves; 
Whereas excess profits taxes were originally adopted by Con-
gress to ‘‘siphon off war profits’’ from company’s prof-
iting as a result of the war and provide assistance to 
those who were struggling and who needed help the most;

Whereas the economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic 
continue to ravage small businesses and Americans 
across the country, and it is unethical and unconscionable 
that some corporations achieve windfall profits directly 
because of the pandemic crisis while everyone else suffers; 
Whereas the Federal Government is spending trillions of dol-
lars in emergency assistance to help struggling individ-
uals and businesses, pushing the country further into 
debt; and 
Whereas corporations who are experiencing obscene financial 
benefit and competitive advantage over other smaller cor-
porations as a result of the pandemic have a responsi-
bility to assist with the relief efforts for those struggling 
the most: Now, therefore, be it
