Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Smart Building Accel-
4
eration Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds that— 
7
(1) the building sector uses more than 40 per-
8
cent of the energy of the United States;

•HR 2044 IH
(2) emerging building energy monitoring and 
1
control technologies are enabling a transition of the 
2
building sector to ‘‘smart’’ buildings that have dra-
3
matically reduced energy use and improved quality 
4
of service to occupants; 
5
(3) an analysis of select private-sector smart 
6
buildings by the Department of Energy would docu-
7
ment the costs and benefits of the emerging tech-
8
nologies, promote the adoption of the technologies, 
9
and accelerate the transition to the technologies; 
10
(4) with over 400,000 buildings, the Federal 
11
Government is the largest building owner in the 
12
United States; and 
13
(5) the Federal Government can also accelerate 
14
the transition to smart building technologies by dem-
15
onstrating and evaluating emerging smart building 
16
technologies using existing programs and funding to 
17
showcase selected Federal smart buildings.
