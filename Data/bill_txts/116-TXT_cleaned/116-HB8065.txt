•HR 8065 IH
(1) Too many Americans cannot achieve finan-
1
cial stability due to income volatility, the rising cost 
2
of living, wage stagnation, and a lack of affordable 
3
housing. 
4
(2) Real wages have failed to keep pace with in-
5
flation, meaning the purchasing power of American 
6
households has not changed in 40 years. 
7
(3) Income volatility, defined as an annual in-
8
come fluctuation of 25 percent or more, impacts 
9
nearly half of the United States population. 
10
(4) 40 percent of American households indicate 
11
that they would face difficulty covering a $400 
12
emergency expense with readily available cash or a 
13
checking account. 
14
(5) Full-time minimum wage earners cannot af-
15
ford an average 2-bedroom apartment anywhere in 
16
the United States. 
17
(6) The changing nature of the economy, in-
18
cluding the rise of the gig economy, unemployment 
19
risks posed by automation, and the fluctuating na-
20
ture of waged labor, will result in increased income 
21
volatility and prohibit upward economic mobility.
