(2) Breast cancer is the most commonly diag-
4
nosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer 
5
death among women. 
6
(3) Death rates from breast cancer in the 
7
United States have dropped 40 percent between

9
avoided during those 28 years. 
10
(4) The decline in breast cancer death rates 
11
have been attributed to both improvements in treat-
12
ment and early detection and screening.

14
and localized stage, the five-year survival rate is 99 
15

18
