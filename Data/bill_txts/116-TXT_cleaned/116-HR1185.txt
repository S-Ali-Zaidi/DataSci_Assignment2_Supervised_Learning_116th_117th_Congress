contexts, and humanitarian settings. 
Whereas, on October 10, 2020, World Mental Health Day is 
observed; 
Whereas mental and physical health are inseparably inter-
twined, and there is no health without mental health;

orders can affect the ability of an individual to carry out 
daily tasks, establish or maintain relationships, or pursue 
other fundamental endeavors; 
Whereas mental health disorders and substance use disorders 
are the leading causes of disability globally; 
Whereas depression is the leading cause of nonfatal disease 
burden globally and in the top five leading causes of dis-
ease burden globally, and by 2030, depression will be the 
leading cause of disease burden in low-income countries 
and the second highest cause of disease burden in middle- 
income countries; 
Whereas depression has a particularly negative impact on 
women, for whom depression is the leading cause of dis-
ease burden independent of income level of their coun-
tries of residence; 
Whereas nearly 2,200 suicide deaths occur each day globally; 
Whereas for each completed suicide, 20 more individuals at-
tempt to commit suicide; 
Whereas up to 90 percent of individuals who commit suicide 
have a diagnosable mental health disorder; 
Whereas serious mental illness, such as schizophrenia and bi-
polar disorder, affects between 13 and 37 percent of the 
population of the world and is extremely debilitating; 
Whereas the global cost of mental health disorders was 
$2,500,000,000,000 in 2010 and is projected to increase 
to nearly $16,000,000,000,000 by 2030, but the total 
amount of development assistance for global mental 
health was only $134,000,000 between 2007 and 2013, 
less than 1 percent of all development assistance;

Whereas in high-income countries, approximately 20 percent 
of individuals afflicted with mental health disorders do 
not receive appropriate mental health care; 
Whereas in low-income countries, as many as 90 percent of 
individuals afflicted with serious mental health disorders 
do not receive appropriate mental health care; 
Whereas traumatic events and losses are common experi-
ences, especially among those who live through societal 
conflict, and may— 
(1) double the incidence of mental health disorders; 
(2) result in intense suffering and dysfunction; and 
(3) require mental health treatment; 
Whereas integrating mental health and psychosocial support 
into health and social sectors improves the health, eco-
nomic development, and political stability of the popu-
lation, builds the capacity of staff and health facilities, 
and creates nonstigmatizing mental health services; and 
Whereas there is an urgent need to create readily accessible, 
high-quality mental health services in line with national 
and global guidelines by designing and implementing 
comprehensive programs that are culturally, develop-
mentally, and linguistically appropriate, building local 
human resource capacity, and strengthening health sys-
tems: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) recognizes the importance of World Mental

Health Day;
