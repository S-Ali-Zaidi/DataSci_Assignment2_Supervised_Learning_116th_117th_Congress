(1) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that— 
14
(A) the collection of debts involves the use 
15
of the mails and wires and other instrumental-
16
ities of interstate commerce; 
17
(B) at times of major disaster or emer-
18
gency, the income of consumers is often im-
19
paired and their necessary daily expenses often 
20
increase; 
21
(C) temporary forbearance benefits not 
22
only consumer and small business debtors, but 
23
also other creditors by avoiding downward col-

lateral price spirals triggered by an increase in 
1
foreclosure activity; 
2
(D) without forbearance, many consumers 
3
and small businesses are unlikely to be able to 
4
pay their obligations according to their original 
5
terms and are likely to default on obligations or 
6
file for bankruptcy, resulting in reduced recov-
7
eries for creditors, and in the case of bank-
8
ruptcy, no recovery of unaccrued interest; 
9
(E) with forbearance, creditors are likely 
10
to realize greater long-term value because con-
11
sumers and small businesses will be more likely 
12
to be able to repay their obligations after the 
13
major disaster or emergency has subsided; 
14
(F) the legislative and administrative re-
15
sponse to major disasters and emergencies may 
16
consist of multiple components divided among 
17
different statutes and programs; and 
18
(G) when evaluating whether property has 
19
been taken from a person without just com-
20
pensation, a holistic evaluation of the burdens 
21
and benefits of all legislative and administrative 
22
responses, including indirect benefits from mac-
23

(2) FURTHER FINDINGS REGARDING MORTGAGE 
1
FORBEARANCE.—Congress further finds that— 
2
(A) ensuring that consumers are able to 
3
remain in their residences reduces the disrup-
4
tions and economic harm caused by such disas-
5
ters and emergencies by ensuring that con-
6
sumers are able to continue their existing em-
7
ployment, education, childcare, and healthcare 
8
arrangements, which are often geographically 
9
based; 
10
(B) temporary forbearance on residential 
11
mortgages is therefore critical to fostering eco-
12
nomic recovery and stability in the wake of 
13
major disasters or emergencies; 
14
(C) temporary mortgage forbearance dur-
15
ing a declared disaster benefits not only mort-
16
gagors, but also mortgagees because mortga-
17
gors’ ability to pay is likely to be restored after 
18
a disaster or emergency subsides, so forbear-
19
ance may increase mortgagors’ total recovery. 
20
Without forbearance, mortgagors are likely to 
21
default or file for bankruptcy, resulting in sig-
22
nificant losses for mortgagees; and 
23
(D) temporary mortgage forbearance dur-
24
ing a declared disaster also benefits the mortga-
25

•HR 6321 IH
gees of other properties because housing prices 
1
are geographically and serially correlated so an 
2
increase in foreclosures can drive down the 
3
value of collateral for all mortgage lenders, fur-
4
ther destabilizing the economy.

(3) FURTHER FINDINGS REGARDING MORTGAGE 
6
SERVICERS.—Congress further finds that— 
7
(A) mortgage servicers are often contrac-
8
tually obligated to advance scheduled mortgage 
9
payments to securitization investors, irrespec-
10
tive of whether the servicer collects the payment 
11
from the mortgagor; 
12
(B) mortgage servicers are often thinly 
13
capitalized and with limited capacity for engag-
14
ing in large scale advancing of payments to 
15
securitization investors; 
16
(C) securitization investors have long been 
17
aware of servicers’ thin capitalization; 
18
(D) in the wake of the 2008 financial cri-
19
sis, several servicers had difficulty obtaining 
20
sufficiently liquidity to make advances; 
21
(E) mortgage servicing is a heavily regu-
22
lated industry; 
23
(F) in response to the 2008 financial cri-
24
sis, Congress created a safe harbor for mort-
25

gage servicers that undertook loan modifica-
1
tions; 
2
(G) in response to the 2008 financial cri-
3
sis, the Home Affordable Modification Program 
4
paid mortgage servicers to undertake loan 
5
modifications; 
6
(H) as part of the 2012 joint State-Fed-
7
eral National Mortgage Settlement, mortgage 
8
servicers committed to undertaking loan modi-
9
fications; and 
10
(I) investors in mortgage securitizations 
11
are or should be aware of servicers’ thin cap-
12
italization, liquidity constraints, the extent and 
13
history of servicing regulation and therefore do 
14
not have a reasonable expectation that the 
15
terms of servicing contracts will be enforceable 
16
at times of national financial crisis. 
17
(4) DETERMINATION.—It is the sense of the 
18
Congress that, on the basis of the findings described 
19
under paragraphs (1), (2), and (3), the Congress de-
20
termines that the provisions of this Act are nec-
21
essary and proper for the purpose of carrying into 
22
execution the powers of the Congress to regulate 
23
commerce among the several States and to establish 
24
uniform bankruptcy laws.

sense of Congress is the following: 
6
(1) The Community Development Financial In-
7
stitutions Fund (the ‘‘CDFI Fund’’) is an agency of 
8
the Department of the Treasury, and was estab-
9
lished by the Riegle Community Development and 
10
Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994. The mission 
11
of the CDFI Fund is ‘‘to expand economic oppor-
12
tunity for underserved people and communities by 
13
supporting the growth and capacity of a national 
14
network of community development lenders, inves-
15
tors, and financial service providers’’. A community 
16
development financial institution (a ‘‘CDFI’’) is a 
17
specialized financial institution serving low-income 
18
communities and a Community Development Entity 
19
(a ‘‘CDE’’) is a domestic corporation or partnership 
20
that is an intermediary vehicle for the provision of 
21
loans, investments, or financial counseling in low-in-
22

Fund programs as follows:

3
which provides FDIC-insured depository institu-
4
tions awards for a demonstrated increase in 
5
lending and investments in distressed commu-
6
nities and CDFIs. 
7
(B) The CDFI Program, which provides 
8
Financial and Technical Assistance awards to 
9
CDFIs to reinvest in the CDFI, and to build 
10
the capacity of the CDFI, including financing 
11
product development and loan loss reserves. 
12
(C) The Native American CDFI Assistance 
13
Program, which provides CDFIs and spon-
14
soring entities Financial and Technical Assist-
15
ance awards to increase lending and grow the 
16
number of CDFIs owned by Native Americans 
17
to help build capacity of such CDFIs. 
18
(D) The New Market Tax Credit Program, 
19
which provides tax credits for making equity in-
20
vestments in CDEs that stimulate capital in-

(F) The Bond Guarantee Program, a 
3
source of long-term, patient capital for CDFIs 
4
to expand lending and investment capacity for 
5
community and economic development purposes. 
6
(2) The Department of the Treasury is author-
7
ized to create multi-year grant programs designed to 
8
encourage low-to-moderate income individuals to es-
9
tablish accounts at federally insured banks, and to 
10
improve low-to-moderate income individuals’ access 
11
to such accounts on reasonable terms. 
12
(3) Under this authority, grants to participants 
13
in CDFI Fund programs may be used for loan-loss 
14
reserves and to establish small-dollar loan programs 
15
by subsidizing related losses. These grants also allow 
16
for the providing recipients with the financial coun-
17
seling and education necessary to conduct trans-
18
actions and manage their accounts. These loans pro-
19
vide low-cost alternatives to payday loans and other 
20
nontraditional forms of financing that often impose 
21
excessive interest rates and fees on borrowers, and 
22
lead millions of Americans to fall into debt traps. 
23
Small-dollar loans can only be made pursuant to

(4) Program participation is restricted to eligi-
3
ble institutions, which are limited to organizations 
4
listed in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue 
5
Code and exempt from tax under 501(a) of such 
6
Code, federally insured depository institutions, com-
7
munity development financial institutions and State, 
8
local, or Tribal government entities. 
9
(5) Since its founding, the CDFI Fund has 
10
awarded over $3,300,000,000 to CDFIs and CDEs, 
11
allocated $54,000,000,000 in tax credits, and 
12
$1,510,000,000 in bond guarantees. According to 
13
the CDFI Fund, some programs attract as much as 
14
$10 in private capital for every $1 invested by the 
15
CDFI Fund. The Administration and the Congress 
16
should prioritize appropriation of funds for the loan 
17
loss reserve fund and technical assistance programs 
18
administered by the Community Development Finan-
19
cial Institution Fund, as included in the version of
