Congress makes the following findings: 
7
(1) The United States aircraft manufacturing 
8
industry produced $342,682,000,000 in economic ac-

tivity from manufacture of aircraft and parts sales 
1
and supported 547,900 direct jobs in 2016. 
2
(2) Growth in the civil aircraft market is pro-
3
jected 
to 
offer 
$8,000,000,000,000 
to 
4
$10,000,000,000,000 in new aircraft sales, parts, 
5
and services over the next 17 years. International 
6
governments are boosting their research and devel-
7
opment investments to give their domestic industries 
8
competitive advantages in the aircraft market. 
9
(3) In 2015, the Department of Defense spent 
10
$10,600,000,000 on jet fuel and $441,600,000 on 
11
jet fuel transportation to support the warfighter. 
12
NASA’s research into ultra-efficient air transport is 
13
important to the military’s efforts to reduce fuel 
14
costs, logistics pressures, and the level of human 
15
risk involved with providing worldwide energy solu-
16
tions. 
17
(4) NASA’s aeronautics research and collabo-
18
rative ventures yield innovations that can eventually 
19
be utilized in the aviation sector, opening up entirely 
20
new markets, enabling the United States aviation in-
21
dustry to grow and maintain global competitiveness, 
22
providing high-quality engineering and manufac-
23
turing jobs, and benefiting the quality of life for our 
24
citizens.

(5) Continued progress in the science and tech-
1
nology of aeronautics is crucial to the United States 
2
sustained economic success and the protection of the 
3
United States security interests at home and around 
4
the world, as acknowledged in the 2006 National 
5
Aeronautics Research and Development Policy. To 
6
ensure Federal efforts remain on a disciplined path 
7
to meet national objectives, the Director of the Of-
8
fice of Science and Technology Policy is responsible 
9
for the implementation and biennial review of the 
10
aeronautics research and development plan of the 
11
United States. 
12
(6) All of NASA’s other directorates and capa-
13
bilities, including those in space, depend on research 
14
and technology that originated and is maintained in 
15
NASA’s Aeronautics Centers. 
16
(7) Aeronautics plays a central role in our na-
17
tional security strategy, and our technological advan-
18
tage over potential adversaries must be maintained 
19
with sustained and focused research and develop-
20
ment.

(8) NASA Aeronautics Research Mission Direc-
22

23
global operations; innovation in civil supersonic air-
24
craft; ultra-efficient subsonic vehicles; quiet and af-

2
aviation transformation) are effective and necessary 
3
research areas for the development of next genera-
4
tion aeronautics technology that will preserve the 
5
United States lead in the global aviation industry. 
6
(9) Aeronautics research is focused on funda-
7
mental capabilities that have the potential to open 
8
entirely new industries, including low-cost electric 
9
propulsion, advanced composite material manufac-
10
turing, simplified air vehicle operation, and in-
11
creased vertical takeoff and landing, that will allow 
12
for safer and more efficient aviation products and 
13
support mobility and economic growth. 
14
(10) To meet the challenges of the 21st cen-
15
tury, the United States needs to support NASA’s 
16
Aeronautics Research Program at funding levels 
17
that are commensurate with its past, present, and 
18
future contributions to the economic competitiveness 
19
and national security of the United States.
