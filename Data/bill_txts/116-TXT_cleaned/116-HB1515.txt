SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) When presented to voters in 2008, Califor-
3
nia’s high-speed rail system was projected to cost 
4
$33.6 billion for a line from San Francisco to Ana-
5
heim, increasing $40 billion to add lines to Sac-
6
ramento and San Diego. 
7
(2) The expanded project’s cost swelled to more 
8
than $100 billion, with the San Francisco to Ana-
9
heim line costing more than $77 billion, and now the 
10
State of California’s high-speed rail plan no longer 
11
includes any stops in Sacramento, San Francisco, 
12
Los Angeles, Anaheim, or San Diego. 
13
(3) When presented to voters in 2008, Cali-
14
fornia claimed the Federal Government would pay 
15
between a quarter and a third of the cost of the rail 
16
system. 
17
(4) The Federal Government had no such grant 
18
program at the time, and the $4 billion invested in 
19
the project represents less than 5 percent of the up-
20
dated cost projections. 
21
(5) At the current level of project employment 
22
it would take nearly 400 years to accomplish the 
23
1,000,000 job-years promised by the California 
24
High-Speed Rail Authority.

(6) No significant private companies have in-
1
vested in the California high-speed rail project. 
2
(7) The grant creation and award process for 
3
the California high-speed rail project did not incor-
4
porate the best practices of Government funding. 
5
(8) The grant agreement between the Federal 
6
Government and California did not require a feasible 
7
funding package to be prepared before awarding 
8
funds, which similar mass transit programs require. 
9
(9) The grant agreement between the Federal 
10
Government and California did not require a min-
11
imum operable segment before awarding funds, 
12
which similar mass transit programs require. 
13
(10) The grant agreement between the Federal 
14
Government and California did not require new 
15
high-speed trains to run on the new high-speed rail 
16
system. 
17
(11) The Department of Transportation inap-
18
propriately allowed the State of California to spend 
19
Federal money without a required State funding 
20
match. 
21
(12) The California High-Speed Rail Authority 
22
repeatedly failed to meet deadlines and underesti-
23
mated costs.

•HR 1515 IH
(13) On March 5, 2019, the Federal Rail Ad-
1
ministration, having recognized the failure of Cali-
2
fornia to build even a small fraction of the originally 
3
approved high-speed rail system, deobligated nearly 
4
$1 billion in Federal funding. 
5
(14) No passenger rail system in the world has 
6
ever been fully self-sufficient. 
7
(15) There are dozens of worthy infrastructure 
8
projects that would improve the quality of life for 
9
every day Americans and could easily have been de-
10
signed, approved, built, and have benefitted local 
11
economies in the time it took for California’s high- 
12
speed rail proposal to fail. 
13
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
14
It is the Sense of Congress that any future high- 
15
speed rail grant programs that are awarded funds by the 
16
Federal Government should have similar or higher re-
17
quirements than existing mass transit programs.
