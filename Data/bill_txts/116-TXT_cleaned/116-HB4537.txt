A BILL 
To amend the Public Health Service Act to improve the 
provision of mobile medical health care services to certain 
underserved areas and populations, and for other pur-
poses. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Mobile Health Clinics

Act of 2019’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 4537 IH
(1) According to the Mobile Health Map report, 
1
approximately 1,500 mobile health clinics (MHCs) 
2
operate nationwide. 
3
(2) MHCs can effectively provide care in areas 
4
where health care infrastructure is limited because 
5
of distance, financial capabilities, or inadequate sup-
6
porting infrastructure, including lack of public 
7
transportation resources. 
8
(3) MHCs can offer services such as primary 
9
care, screenings, dental care, medications, behavioral 
10
health care, immunizations, laboratory tests, case 
11
management, triage, and assistance for public ben-
12
efit programs. 
13
(4) MHCs help improve community health and 
14
access to medical services in underserved commu-
15
nities across the United States, including urban, 
16
rural, and suburban areas. 
17
(5) Such clinics are cost-effective and help re-
18
duce the burden on hospitals, insurers, and govern-
19
ment entities managing health programs by pro-
20
viding prevention services, which also reduces unnec-
21
essary emergency department visits. 
22
(6) The average cost of a visit to a provider of 
23
mobile medical health care services is significantly 
24
lower than the average cost of an emergency depart-
25

•HR 4537 IH
ment visit. Visiting an MHC instead of the emer-
1
gency department can result in a cost savings of 
2
more than $800 per visit. 
3
(7) Several studies have shown that the return 
4
on investment generated by MHCs ranges from $20 
5
to $36 for every $1 spent. 
6
(8) MHCs are successful when they engage with 
7
other local stakeholders who can provide insight, 
8
knowledge, and strategies to help meet public health 
9
challenges that are immediately relevant to the com-
10
munities receiving services from MHC providers. 
11
(9) Funding has been the largest barrier to the 
12
development and maintenance of MHCs and their 
13
resources. 
14
(10) With additional Federal support, health 
15
systems would be able to better invest in purchasing, 
16
maintaining, and upgrading mobile units, increasing 
17
the number of staff, dispensing more medication, 
18
and advancing the use of efficient information tech-
19
nology for health purposes.
