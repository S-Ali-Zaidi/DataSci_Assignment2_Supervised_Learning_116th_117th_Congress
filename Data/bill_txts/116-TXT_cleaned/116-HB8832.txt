(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
4
(1) The SARS–CoV–2 virus that originated in 
5
China and causes the disease COVID–19 has caused 
6

•HR 8832 IH
untold misery and devastation throughout the world, 
1
including in the United States. 
2
(2) For months, frontline health care workers 
3
and health care facilities have fought the virus with 
4
courage and resolve. They did so at first with very 
5
little information about how to treat the virus and 
6
developed strategies to save lives of the people of the 
7
United States in real time. They risked their per-
8
sonal health and wellbeing to protect and treat their 
9
patients. 
10
(3) Businesses in the United States kicked into 
11
action to produce and procure personal protective 
12
equipment, such as masks, gloves, face shields, and 
13
hand sanitizer, and other necessary medical supplies, 
14
such as ventilators, at unprecedented rates. 
15
(4) To halt the spread of the disease, State and 
16
local governments took drastic measures. They shut 
17
down small and large businesses, schools, colleges 
18
and universities, religious, philanthropic and other 
19
nonprofit institutions, and local government agen-
20
cies. They ordered people to remain in their homes. 
21
(5) This standstill was needed to slow the 
22
spread of the virus. But it devastated the economy 
23
of the United States. The sum of hundreds of local- 
24
level and State-level decisions to close nearly every 
25

4 
•HR 8832 IH
space in which people might gather brought inter-
1
state commerce nearly to a halt. 
2
(6) This halt led to the loss of millions of jobs. 
3
These lost jobs were not a natural consequence of 
4
the economic environment, but rather the result of 
5
a drastic, though temporary, response to the unprec-
6
edented nature of this global pandemic. 
7
(7) Congress passed a series of statutes to ad-
8
dress the health care and economic crises—the 
9
Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supple-
10
mental Appropriations Act, 2020 (Public Law 116– 
11
123; 134 Stat. 146), the Families First Coronavirus 
12
Response Act (Public Law 116–127; 134 Stat. 178), 
13
the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security 
14
Act or the CARES Act (Public Law 116–136), and 
15
the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care 
16
Enhancement Act (Public Law 116–139; 134 Stat. 
17
620). In these laws Congress exercised its power 
18
under the Commerce and Spending Clauses of the 
19
Constitution of the United States to direct trillions 
20
of taxpayer dollars toward efforts to aid workers, 
21
businesses, State and local governments, health care 
22
workers, and patients. 
23
(8) This legislation provided short-term insula-
24
tion from the worst of the economic storm, but these 
25
07:33 Dec 10, 2020
H8832
5 
•HR 8832 IH
laws alone cannot protect the United States from 
1
further devastation. Only reopening the economy so 
2
that workers can get back to work and students can 
3
get back to school can accomplish that goal. 
4
(9) The Constitution of the United States spe-
5
cifically enumerates the legislative powers of Con-
6
gress. One of those powers is the regulation of inter-
7
state commerce. The Government is not a substitute 
8
for the economy, but it has the authority and the 
9
duty to act when interstate commerce is threatened 
10
and damaged. As applied to the present crisis, Con-
11
gress can deploy its power over interstate commerce 
12
to promote a prudent reopening of businesses and 
13
other organizations that serve as the foundation and 
14
backbone of the national economy and of commerce 
15
among the States. These include small and large 
16
businesses, schools (which are substantial employers 
17
in their own right and provide necessary services to 
18
enable parents and other caregivers to return to 
19
work), colleges and universities (which are substan-
20
tial employers and supply the interstate market for 
21
higher-education services), religious, philanthropic 
22
and other nonprofit institutions (which are substan-
23
tial employers and provide necessary services to their 
24
communities), and local government agencies.

(10) Congress must also ensure that the Na-
1
tion’s health care workers and health care facilities 
2
are able to act fully to defeat the virus. 
3
(11) Congress must also safeguard its invest-
4
ment of taxpayer dollars under the CARES Act and 
5
other coronavirus legislation. Congress must ensure 
6
that those funds are used to help businesses and 
7
workers survive and recover from the economic cri-
8
sis, and to help health care workers and health care 
9
facilities defeat the virus. CARES Act funds cannot 
10
be diverted from these important purposes to line 
11
the pockets of the trial bar. 
12
(12) One of the chief impediments to the con-
13
tinued flow of interstate commerce as this public- 
14
health crisis has unfolded is the risk of litigation. 
15
Small and large businesses, schools, colleges and 
16
universities, religious, philanthropic and other non-
17
profit institutions, and local government agencies 
18
confront the risk of a tidal wave of lawsuits accusing 
19
them of exposing employees, customers, students, 
20
and worshipers to coronavirus. Health care workers 
21
face the threat of lawsuits arising from their efforts 
22
to fight the virus. 
23
(13) They confront this litigation risk even as 
24
they work tirelessly to comply with the coronavirus 
25
07:33 Dec 10, 2020
H8832
7 
•HR 8832 IH
guidance, rules, and regulations issued by local gov-
1
ernments, State governments, and the Federal Gov-
2
ernment. They confront this risk notwithstanding 
3
equipment and staffing shortages. And they confront 
4
this risk while also grappling with constantly chang-
5
ing information on how best to protect employees, 
6
customers, students, and worshipers from the virus, 
7
and how best to treat it. 
8
(14) These lawsuits pose a substantial risk to 
9
interstate commerce because they threaten to keep 
10
small and large businesses, schools, colleges and uni-
11
versities, religious, philanthropic and other nonprofit 
12
institutions, and local government agencies from re-
13
opening for fear of expensive litigation that might 
14
prove to be meritless. These lawsuits further threat-
15
en to undermine the Nation’s fight against the virus 
16
by exposing our health care workers and health care 
17
facilities to liability for difficult medical decisions 
18
they have made under trying and uncertain cir-
19
cumstances. 
20
(15) These lawsuits also risk diverting taxpayer 
21
money provided under the CARES Act and other 
22
coronavirus legislation from its intended purposes to 
23
the pockets of opportunistic trial lawyers. 
24
07:33 Dec 10, 2020
H8832
8 
•HR 8832 IH
(16) This risk is not purely local. It is nec-
1
essarily national in scale. A patchwork of local and 
2
State rules governing liability in coronavirus-related 
3
lawsuits creates tremendous unpredictability for ev-
4
eryone participating in interstate commerce and acts 
5
as a significant drag on national recovery. The ag-
6
gregation of each individual potential liability risk 
7
poses a substantial and unprecedented threat to 
8
interstate commerce. 
9
(17) The accumulated economic risks for these 
10
potential defendants directly and substantially af-
11
fects interstate commerce. Individuals and entities 
12
potentially subject to coronavirus-related liability will 
13
structure their decision making to avoid that liabil-
14
ity. Small and large businesses, schools, colleges and 
15
universities, religious, philanthropic and other non-
16
profit institutions, and local government agencies 
17
may decline to reopen because of the risk of litiga-
18
tion. They may limit their output or engagement 
19
with customers and communities to avoid the risk of 
20
litigation. These individual economic decisions sub-
21
stantially affect interstate commerce because, as a 
22
whole, they will prevent the free and fair exchange 
23
of goods and services across State lines. Such eco-
24
nomic activity that, individually and in the aggre-
25
07:33 Dec 10, 2020
H8832
9 
•HR 8832 IH
gate, substantially affects interstate commerce is 
1
precisely the sort of conduct that should be subject 
2
to congressional regulation. 
3
(18) Lawsuits against health care workers and 
4
facilities pose a similarly dangerous risk to interstate 
5
commerce. Interstate commerce will not truly re-
6
bound from this crisis until the virus is defeated, 
7
and that will not happen unless health care workers 
8
and facilities are free to combat vigorously the virus 
9
and treat patients with coronavirus and those other-
10
wise impacted by the response to coronavirus. 
11
(19) Subjecting health care workers and facili-
12
ties to onerous litigation even as they have done 
13
their level best to combat a virus about which very 
14
little was known when it arrived in the United 
15
States would divert important health care resources 
16
from hospitals and providers to courtrooms. 
17
(20) Such a diversion would substantially affect 
18
interstate commerce by degrading the national ca-
19
pacity for combating the virus and saving patients, 
20
thereby substantially elongating the period before 
21
interstate commerce could fully re-engage. 
22
(21) Congress also has the authority to deter-
23
mine the jurisdiction of the courts of the United 
24
States, to set the standards for causes of action they 
25
07:33 Dec 10, 2020
H8832
10 
•HR 8832 IH
can hear, and to establish the rules by which those 
1
causes of action should proceed. Congress therefore 
2
must act to set rules governing liability in coronavi-
3
rus-related lawsuits. 
4
(22) These rules necessarily must be temporary 
5
and carefully tailored to the interstate crisis caused 
6
by the coronavirus pandemic. They must extend no 
7
further than necessary to meet this uniquely na-
8
tional crisis for which a patchwork of State and local 
9
tort laws are ill-suited. 
10
(23) Because of the national scope of the eco-
11
nomic and health care dangers posed by the risks of 
12
coronavirus-related lawsuits, establishing temporary 
13
rules governing liability for certain coronavirus-re-
14
lated tort claims is a necessary and proper means of 
15
carrying into execution Congress’ power to regulate 
16
commerce among the several States. 
17
(24) Because Congress must safeguard the in-
18
vestment of taxpayer dollars it made in the CARES 
19
Act and other coronavirus legislation, and ensure 
20
that they are used for their intended purposes and 
21
not diverted for other purposes, establishing tem-
22
porary rules governing liability for certain coronavi-
23
rus-related tort claims is a necessary and proper

means of carrying into execution Congress’ power to

(b) PURPOSES.—Pursuant to the powers delegated to 
3
Congress by article I, section 8, clauses 1, 3, 9, and 18, 
4
and article III, section 2, clause 1 of the Constitution of 
5
the United States, the purposes of this Act are to— 
6
(1) establish necessary and consistent standards 
7
for litigating certain claims specific to the unique 
8
coronavirus pandemic; 
9
(2) prevent the overburdening of the court sys-
10
tems with undue litigation; 
11
(3) encourage planning, care, and appropriate 
12
risk management by small and large businesses, 
13
schools, colleges and universities, religious, philan-
14
thropic and other nonprofit institutions, local gov-
15
ernment agencies, and health care providers; 
16
(4) ensure that the Nation’s recovery from the 
17
coronavirus economic crisis is not burdened or 
18
slowed by the substantial risk of litigation; 
19
(5) prevent litigation brought to extract settle-
20
ments and enrich trial lawyers rather than vindicate 
21
meritorious claims; 
22
(6) protect interstate commerce from the bur-
23
dens of potentially meritless litigation;

out artificial and unnecessary delay; 
2
(8) protect the interests of the taxpayers by en-
3
suring that emergency taxpayer support continues to 
4
aid businesses, workers, and health care providers 
5
rather than enrich trial lawyers; and 
6
(9) protect the highest and best ideals of the 
7
national economy, so businesses can produce and

serve their customers, workers can work, teachers
