SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds that— 
2
(1) millions of Americans continue to experience 
3
domestic or sexual violence each year with more 
4
than three women murdered by their partners each 
5
day; 
6
(2) this type of violence and abuse results in 
7
short-term and chronic physical and behavioral 
8
health consequences that have a significant economic 
9
burden to victims and communities; 
10
(3) new CDC data found the lifetime per-victim 
11
cost of intimate partner violence was $103,767 for 
12
women victims with 59 percent going to medical 
13
costs and public funding paid 37 percent of this 
14
total cost; 
15
(4) victims are also at a higher risk for devel-
16
oping addictions to tobacco, alcohol, or drugs; for ex-
17
ample, 31 percent to 67 percent of women in sub-
18
stance use disorder treatment programs report expe-
19
riencing domestic violence within the past year; 
20
(5) over 50 percent of survivors of domestic vio-
21
lence have experienced depression, post-traumatic 
22
stress disorder, and substance use and 23 percent 
23
have experienced suicidality; 
24
(6) a study conducted by the National Domestic 
25
Violence Hotline, in conjunction with the National

2
ercion where abusers intentionally undermine their 
3
partners’ sanity or sobriety, control their access to 
4
medication, and sabotage their treatment and recov-
5
ery efforts among other coercion tactics; 
6
(7) researchers have also found that exposure 
7
to multiple childhood traumas such as sexual abuse 
8
and domestic violence can cause long-term negative 
9
physical and emotional health outcomes such as 
10
heart disease, cancer and depression; 
11
(8) health care providers can identify survivors 
12
of violence and interventions can decrease risk for 
13
violence and improve health outcomes, but health 
14
providers need training and systems level support in 
15
order to do so; 
16
(9) Congress authorized a public health re-
17
sponse to victims of domestic and sexual violence in 
18
the Violence Against Women Act of 2005; 
19
(10) since its enactment, the VAWA Health 
20
program has trained more than 13,000 health care 
21
providers to assess for and respond to domestic and 
22
sexual violence in over 230 clinical settings serving 
23
more than 1.3 million patients;

(11) last year, the Health Resources & Services 
1
Administration made this issue a priority across all 
2
of its bureaus and released the ‘‘HRSA Strategy to 
3
Address Intimate Partner Violence 2017–2020’’ with 
4
four key priorities: 
5
(A) Train the Nation’s health care and 
6
public health workforce to address intimate 
7
partner violence (IPV) at the community and 
8
health systems levels. 
9
(B) Develop partnerships to raise aware-
10
ness about IPV within HRSA and HHS. 
11
(C) Increase access to quality IPV-in-
12
formed health care services across all popu-
13
lations. 
14
(D) Address gaps in knowledge about IPV 
15
risks, impacts, and interventions.; and 
16
(12) a strong public health response can pre-
17
vent and address the immediate and long-term 
18
health impacts of this type of violence and abuse.
