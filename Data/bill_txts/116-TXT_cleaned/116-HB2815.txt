SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds as follows: 
2
(1) The program of payments to teaching 
3
health centers for graduate medical education under 
4
section 340H of the Public Health Service Act (42 
5
U.S.C. 256h) was enacted in 2010 and reauthorized 
6
in 2015 and 2018 to address the crisis-level shortage 
7
of primary care physicians, especially in rural and 
8
medically underserved communities. 
9
(2) Teaching health center residents and faculty 
10
will provide more than 1,000,000 primary care med-
11
ical visits in 2019 to underserved communities. 
12
(3) When compared with traditional Medicare 
13
GME residents, residents who train at teaching 
14
health centers are more likely to practice primary 
15
care and remain in underserved or rural commu-
16
nities. 
17
(4) The teaching health center program not 
18
only plays a vital role in training the Nation’s next 
19
generation of primary care physicians (including 
20
dentists), but helps bridge the Nation’s physician 
21
shortfall and address the maldistribution of physi-
22
cians across the United States. 
23
(5) For these reasons, it is of vital importance 
24
to continue the program under section 340H of the 
25
Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 256h) at a
