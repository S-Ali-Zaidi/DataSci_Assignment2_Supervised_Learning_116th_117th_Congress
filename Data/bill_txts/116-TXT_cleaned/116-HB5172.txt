ments in the hospital outpatient setting. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

(1) The United States is undergoing an epi-
1
demic of addiction and deaths caused by prescription 
2
drug overdoses. According to the Centers for Disease 
3
Control and Prevention (CDC), opioids are the main 
4
driver of drug overdose deaths accounting for 47,600 
5
overdose deaths in 2017. Every day, over 130 people 
6
die in the United States from opioid overdoses. 
7
(2) Additionally, the CDC estimates that the 
8
economic costs associated with prescription opioid 
9
misuse exceeds $78 billion annually. These costs in-
10
clude those associated with healthcare, lost produc-
11
tivity, addiction treatment, and the criminal justice 
12
system. 
13
(3) Certain non-opioid treatments and services 
14
can be successful in replacing, delaying, or reducing 
15
the use of opioids to treat postsurgical pain. 
16
(4) The Substance Use-Disorder Prevention 
17
that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment 
18
(SUPPORT) for Patients and Communities Act was 
19
enacted on October 24, 2018. This law requires that 
20
CMS review payments under Medicare’s Outpatient 
21
Prospective Payment System (OPPS) and ASC Pay-
22
ment System with a goal of ensuring there are not 
23
financial incentives to use opioids instead of non- 
24
opioid alternatives. Additionally, the bill requires

CMS to ‘‘consider the extent to which payment pol-
1
icy revisions (such as the creation of additional 
2
groups of covered OPD services to classify sepa-
3
rately those procedures that utilize opioids and non- 
4
opioid alternatives for pain management) would re-
5
duce payment incentives to use opioids instead of 
6
non-opioid alternatives for pain management.’’ 
7
(5) Pursuant to section 319 of the Public 
8
Health Service Act, the Acting Secretary for the 
9
U.S. Department of Health & Human Services de-
10
termined on October 26, 2017, that a public health 
11
emergency exists as a result of the consequences of 
12
the opioid crisis, and the Secretary renewed this de-
13
termination on October 16, 2019. 
14
(6) The President’s Commission on Combating 
15
Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis was estab-
16
lished on March 29, 2017. The Commission rec-
17
ommended that CMS examine payment policies for 
18
certain drugs that function specifically as non-opioid 
19
pain management treatments. According to the 
20
Commission’s report, ‘‘. . . the current CMS pay-
21
ment policy for ‘supplies’ related to surgical proce-
22
dures creates unintended incentives to prescribe 
23
opioid medications to patients for postsurgical pain 
24
instead of administering non-opioid pain medica-

tions. Under current policies, CMS provides one all- 
1
inclusive bundled payment to hospitals for all ‘sur-
2
gical supplies,’ which includes hospital administered 
3
drug products intended to manage patients’ post-
4
surgical pain. This policy results in the hospitals re-
5
ceiving the same fixed fee from Medicare whether 
6
the surgeon administers a non-opioid medication or 
7
not.’’ 
8
(7) The Pain Management Best Practices 
9
Inter-Agency Task Force was authorized by section 
10
101 of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery 
11
Act of 2016. The Task Force consisted of Federal 
12
agency representatives as well as experts and rep-
13
resentatives from a broad group of invested stake-
14
holders and was convened to issue recommendations 
15
for identifying and addressing gaps and inconsist-
16
encies for managing acute pain. In the Task Force’s 
17
Final Report on Best Practices: Updates, Gaps, In-
18
consistencies and Recommendations, the following 
19
gap was identified: ‘‘Multimodal, non-opioid thera-
20
pies are underutilized in the perioperative, inflam-
21
matory, musculoskeletal, and neuropathic injury set-
22
tings.’’ The report also states that ‘‘Non-opioids 
23
should be used as first-line therapy whenever clini-

cally appropriate in the inpatient and outpatient set-
1
tings.’’ 
2
(8) Research shows that despite ongoing efforts 
3
to end the opioid crisis, patients continue to receive 
4
large quantities of opioids to treat postsurgical pain. 
5
One 2018 study showed that 12 percent of patients 
6
who had a soft tissue or orthopedic operation in the 
7
year prior reported that they had become addicted 
8
or dependent on opioids. Further research shows 
9
that patients receiving an opioid prescription after 
10
short-stay surgeries have a 44 percent increased risk 
11
of opioid use. 
12
(9) CMS has reiterated its position in rule-
13
making that it is appropriate to pay separately for 
14
certain non-opioid pain management treatments that 
15
function as surgical supplies in the ASC setting, it 
16
is clear that direction from Congress is necessary to 
17
modify Medicare’s outpatient policies with the goal 
18
of encouraging access to non-opioid treatments and 
19
services to address the opioid crisis.
