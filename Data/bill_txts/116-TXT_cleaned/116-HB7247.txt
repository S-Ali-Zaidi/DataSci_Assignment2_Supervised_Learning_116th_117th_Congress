(b) ESTABLISHMENT.— 
3
(1) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary shall establish 
4
a program, to be known as the ‘‘Integrated Energy 
5
Systems Program’’— 
6
(A) to maximize energy production and ef-
7
ficiency; 
8
(B) to develop energy systems involving 
9
the integration of nuclear energy with renew-
10
able energy, fossil energy, and energy storage; 
11
and 
12
(C) to expand the use of emissions-reduc-
13
ing energy technologies into nonelectric sectors 
14
to achieve significant reductions in environ-
15
mental emissions. 
16
(2) PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION; PARTNERS.— 
17
The program shall be carried out by the Undersecre-
18
tary of Energy, in partnership with— 
19
(A) relevant offices within the Department 
20
of Energy; 
21
(B) National Laboratories; 
22
(C) institutions of higher education; and 
23
(D) the private sector.

(3) GOALS AND MILESTONES.—The Secretary 
1
shall establish quantitative goals and milestones for 
2
the program. 
3
(c) RESEARCH AREAS.—Research areas under the 
4
program may include— 
5
(1) technology innovation to further the expan-
6
sion of emissions-reducing energy technologies to ac-
7
commodate a modern, resilient grid system by— 
8
(A) effectively leveraging multiple energy 
9
sources; 
10
(B) enhancing and streamlining engineer-
11
ing design; 
12
(C) carrying out process demonstrations to 
13
optimize performance; and 
14
(D) streamlining regulatory review; 
15
(2) advanced power cycles, energy extraction, 
16
and processing of complex hydrocarbons to produce 
17
high-value chemicals; 
18
(3) efficient use of emissions-reducing energy 
19
technologies for hydrogen production to support 
20
transportation and industrial needs; 
21
(4) enhancement and acceleration of domestic 
22
manufacturing and desalinization technologies and 
23
processes by optimally using clean energy sources;

(5) more effective thermal energy use, trans-
1
port, and storage; 
2
(6) the demonstration of nuclear energy deliv-
3
ery for— 
4
(A) the production of chemicals, metals, 
5
and fuels; 
6
(B) the capture, use, and storage of car-
7
bon; 
8
(C) renewable integration with an inte-
9
grated energy system; and 
10
(D) conversion of carbon feedstock, such 
11
as coal, biomass, natural gas, and refuse waste, 
12
to higher value nonelectric commodities; 
13
(7) the development of new analysis capabilities 
14
to identify the best ways— 
15
(A) to leverage multiple energy sources in 
16
a given region; and 
17
(B) to quantify the benefits of integrated 
18
energy systems; and 
19
(8) any other area that, as determined by the 
20
Secretary, meets the purpose and goals of the pro-
21
gram. 
22
(d) GRANTS.—The Secretary may award grants 
23
under the program to support the goals of the program.
