Whereas Paul Whelan was imprisoned in Lefortovo Prison 
and continues to be held there more than eight months 
after his arrest; 
Whereas the Federal Security Service has not provided any 
evidence of supposed wrongdoing; 
Whereas a Moscow court has extended Paul Whelan’s pre- 
trial detention multiple times without publicly presenting 
justification or evidence of wrongdoing; 
Whereas officials from the United States Embassy in Moscow 
have routinely had their topics of discussion with Paul 
Whelan severely limited by the Federal Security Service; 
Whereas even Paul Whelan’s Federal Security Service-ap-
pointed lawyer, Vladimir Zherebenkov, said on May 24, 
2019, ‘‘[The Federal Security Service] always roll[s] out 
what they have, but in this case, we’ve seen nothing con-
crete against Whelan in five months. That means there 
is nothing.’’; 
Whereas the United States Ambassador to Russia, Jon 
Huntsman, responded on April 12, 2019, to a question 
about the detention of Paul Whelan, ‘‘If the Russians 
have evidence, they should bring it forward. We have seen 
nothing. If there was a case, I think the evidence would 
have been brought forward by now.’’; and 
Whereas Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with Russian 
Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on May 14, 2019, and 
urged him to ensure United States citizens are not un-
justly held abroad: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
