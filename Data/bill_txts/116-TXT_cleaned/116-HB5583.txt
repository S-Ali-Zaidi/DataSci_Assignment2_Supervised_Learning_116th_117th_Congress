friends without their parents in the home, and the 
1
vast majority of such children are raised outside of 
2
the foster care system. 
3
(2) The majority of kinship caregivers are 
4
grandparents, and such families are commonly re-
5
ferred to as ‘‘grandfamilies’’. 
6
(3) For every child in foster care living with rel-
7
atives, there are 19 being raised by relatives outside 
8
of the foster care system. 
9
(4) More than one-third of all children placed 
10
in foster care because of parental drug or alcohol 
11
use are placed with relatives. 
12
(5) Children who have been exposed to sub-
13
stance misuse in the home may also experience 
14
abuse and neglect, and research indicates that chil-
15
dren in family foster care because of substance use 
16
are more likely to be placed with relatives than with 
17
nonrelatives.
