SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Quiet Communities 
2
Act of 2019’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds that: 
5
(1) Approximately 28,000,000 Americans are 
6
afflicted with some hearing loss and it has been esti-
7
mated that 10,000,000 of these impairments are at 
8
least partially attributable to damage from exposure 
9
to noise. 
10
(2) For millions of Americans, noise from air-
11
craft, vehicular traffic, and a variety of other 
12
sources is a constant source of torment. Millions of 
13
Americans are exposed to noise levels that can lead 
14
to sleep loss, psychological and physiological damage, 
15
and work disruption. 
16
(3) Chronic exposure to noise has been linked 
17
to increased risk of cardiovascular disorders, learn-
18
ing deficits in children, stress, and diminished qual-
19
ity of life. 
20
(4) Excessive noise leading to sleep deprivation 
21
and task interruptions can result in untold costs on 
22
society in diminished worker productivity. 
23
(5) Pursuant to authorities granted under the 
24
Clean Air Act of 1970, the Noise Control Act of 
25
1972, and the Quiet Communities Act of 1978, the 
26

•HR 3001 IH
Environmental Protection Agency established an Of-
1
fice of Noise Abatement and Control. Its responsibil-
2
ities included promulgating noise emission stand-
3
ards, requiring product labeling, facilitating the de-
4
velopment of low emission products, coordinating 
5
Federal noise reduction programs, assisting State 
6
and local abatement efforts, and promoting noise 
7
education and research. However, funding for the 
8
Office of Noise Abatement and Control was termi-
9
nated in 1982 and no funds have been provided 
10
since. 
11
(6) Because the Environmental Protection 
12
Agency remains legally responsible for enforcing reg-
13
ulations issued under the Noise Control Act of 1972 
14
even though funding for these activities were termi-
15
nated, and because the Noise Control Act of 1972 
16
prohibits State and local governments from regu-
17
lating noise sources in many situations, noise abate-
18
ment programs across the country lie dormant. 
19
(7) As population growth and air and vehicular 
20
traffic continue to increase, noise pollution is likely 
21
to become an even greater problem in the future. 
22
The health and welfare of our citizens demands that 
23
the Environmental Protection Agency, the lead Fed-
24
eral agency for the protection of public health and

the Environmental Protection Agency an Office of Noise 
7
Abatement and Control. 
8
(b) DUTIES.—The responsibilities of the Office in-
9
clude the following: 
10
(1) To promote the development of effective 
11
State and local noise control programs by providing

States with technical assistance and grants to de-
13
velop the programs, including the purchase of equip-
14
ment for local communities. 
15
(2) To carry out a national noise control re-
16
search program to assess the impacts of noise from 
17
varied noise sources on mental and physical health. 
18
(3) To carry out a national noise environmental 
19
assessment program to identify trends in noise expo-
20
sure and response, ambient levels, and compliance 
21
data and to determine the effectiveness of noise 
22
abatement actions, including actions for areas 
23
around major transportation facilities (such as high-
24
ways, railroad facilities, and airports).

(4) To develop and disseminate information and 
1
educational materials to the public on the mental 
2
and physical effects of noise and the most effective

means for noise control through the use of materials 
4
for school curricula, volunteer organizations, radio 
5
and television programs, publications, and other 
6
means. 
7
(5) To develop educational and training mate-
