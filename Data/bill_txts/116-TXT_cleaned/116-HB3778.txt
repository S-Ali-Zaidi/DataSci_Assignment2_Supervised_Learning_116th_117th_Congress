This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Cady Housh and 
2
Gemesha Thomas Student Suicide Prevention Act of 
3
2019’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
5
Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) In the last 12 years, suicide has been on the 
7
increase, moving up to the second leading cause of 
8
death for young people between the ages of 10 and 
9
24 with about 157,000 youth treated at emergency 
10
departments for self-inflicted injuries. 
11
(2) According to the 2017 Youth Risk Behav-
12
iors Survey of the Centers for Disease Control and 
13
Prevention, 16 percent of high school students re-
14
ported seriously considering suicide, and 8 percent 
15
reporting attempting to take their lives during that 
16
period. 
17
(3) Eighty percent of students show warning 
18
signs before attempting suicide. 
19
(4) Prevention and awareness training will 
20
equip individuals to become aware of the warning 
21
signs of suicide, identify students in crisis, and pro-
22
vide resources for help. 
23
(5) Research shows that inquiring about suicide 
24
ideation, or discussing suicide in terms of recog-
25
nizing risk factors and prevention methods—

(A) does not increase the chance of suicide; 
1
and 
2
(B) in fact, can lower the risk of suicide. 
3
(6) Sexual minority youth (LGBTQ) are almost 
4
five times more likely to have attempted suicide com-
5
pared to their heterosexual peers.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
7
It is the sense of the Congress that— 
8
(1) student suicide awareness, prevention train-
9
ing, and response materials should be available to all 
10
school personnel, including administrative personnel, 
11
teachers, counselors, and other school leaders; 
12
(2) States should give autonomy to each local 
13
educational agency to— 
14
(A) adopt a policy with respect to student 
15
suicide awareness and prevention; and 
16
(B) work collaboratively with local organi-
17
zations, youth mental health experts, health 
18
care providers, and the Secretary of Health and 
19
Human Services to implement training for 
20
school personnel and students, including by 
21
sharing and disseminating— 
22
(i) training materials and resources; 
23
and

(ii) information that is evidence-based 
1
or promising on student suicide prevention; 
2
(3) the Secretary of Health and Human Serv-
3
ices should identify the highest unmet needs, specifi-
4
cally with students of color; 
5
(4) schools should offer to students in grades 9 
6
through 12, with the support of organizations with 
7
demonstrated expertise in cultural competency, sui-
8
cide awareness, response, and prevention training 
9
with an ‘‘opt out’’ component to be signed by par-
10
ents, guardians, or students over the age of 18; 
11
(5) students who receive such training should 
12
not be taught to be counselors, but rather should be 
13
educated on how to— 
14
(A) recognize signs of suicide and depres-
15
sion; 
16
(B) report these signs to appropriate staff; 
17
and 
18
(C) identify sources of care and support; 
19
and 
20
(6) schools should utilize school-based mental 
21
health professionals and other community partner-
22
ships.
