RESOLUTION 
Resolving that jurisdictions seeking to dismantle or reduce 
funding for the jurisdiction’s police force should not un-
duly burden residents who seek to defend themselves. 
Whereas the killing of George Floyd was a horrific and des-
picable act; 
Whereas racism in any form is wrong and should not be tol-
erated; 
Whereas adequate and accountable police departments are 
vital to helping people to defend themselves and their 
property; and 
Whereas the right to defend oneself is a God-given natural 
right enshrined in the Constitution and upheld in English 
common law and recent Supreme Court cases: Now, 
therefore, be it

Resolved, That— 
1
(1) any jurisdiction in the United States, which 
2
seeks to dismantle or reduce funding for a police 
3
force, should undertake a review of its local rules to 
4
ensure such rules do not place an undue burden on 
5
its residents who seek to defend themselves, includ-
6
ing the legal purchase of a firearm and any training 
7
services such individuals choose; 
8
(2) such a review should be based on the stand-
9
ards set forth by the Supreme Court in the cases 
10
District of Columbia v. Heller and McDonald v. Chi-
11
cago, which confirmed the Second Amendment to 
12
the Constitution to be an individual right and that 
13
no law can prohibit an individual from possessing 
14
and using a firearm in the home for self-defense; 
15
and 
16
(3) any jurisdiction which seeks to dismantle or 
17
reduce funding for police agencies must ensure they 
18
remove rules that hinder individual gun ownership or 
19
access to firearms.
