SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress makes the following findings: 
2
(1) The International Criminal Police Organiza-
3
tion (INTERPOL) works to prevent and fight crime 
4
through enhanced cooperation and innovation on po-
5
lice and security matters, including counterter-
6
rorism, cybercrime, counternarcotics, and transna-
7
tional organized crime. 
8
(2) United States membership and participation 
9
in INTERPOL advances the national security and 
10
law enforcement interests of the United States re-
11
lated to combating terrorism, cybercrime, narcotics, 
12
and transnational organized crime. 
13
(3) Article 2 of INTERPOL’s Constitution 
14
states that the organization aims ‘‘[t]o ensure and 
15
promote the widest possible mutual assistance be-
16
tween all criminal police authorities . . . in the spir-
17
it of the ‘Universal Declaration of Human Rights’ ’’. 
18
(4) Article 3 of INTERPOL’s Constitution 
19
states that ‘‘[i]t is strictly forbidden for the Organi-
20
zation to undertake any intervention or activities of 
21
a political, military, religious or racial character’’. 
22
(5) Some INTERPOL member countries have 
23
used INTERPOL’s databases and processes, includ-
24
ing Notice and Diffusion mechanisms and the Stolen 
25

of a political or other unlawful character and in vio-
1
lation of international human rights standards, in-
2
cluding making requests to INTERPOL for inter-
3
ventions related to purported charges of ordinary 
4
law crimes that are fabricated for political or other 
5
unlawful motives. 
6
(6) According to the Justice Manual of the 
7
United States Department of Justice, ‘‘[i]n the 
8
United States, national law prohibits the arrest of 
9
the subject of a Red Notice issued by another 
10
INTERPOL member country, based upon the notice 
11
alone’’ and requires the existence of a valid extra-
12
dition treaty between the requesting country and the 
13
United States, a diplomatic request for provisional 
14
arrest of the subject individual, and an arrest war-
15
rant from the United States Attorney’s Office of the 
16
subject jurisdiction. 
17
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
18

19
tion and other autocratic countries have abused 
20
INTERPOL’s databases and processes, including Notice 
21
and Diffusion mechanisms and the Stolen and Lost Travel 
22
Document Database, for political and other unlawful pur-
23
poses, such as intimidating, harassing, and persecuting
