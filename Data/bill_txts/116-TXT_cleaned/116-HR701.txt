RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for policies that maintain a robust, fully 
funded and staffed Veterans Health Administration of 
the Department of Veterans Affairs and do not jeop-
ardize care for veterans by moving essential resources 
to the for-profit private sector. 
Whereas Congress has promoted policies to improve the 
health care capabilities of the Department of Veterans 
Affairs by providing significant increases in funds to hire 
staff, conduct research, build more facilities, and improve 
training;

Whereas the approximately 19,300,000 veterans of the 
United States are a diverse group of individuals including 
older veterans with diseases associated with aging and 
disabilities associated with past wars which require fre-
quent care and younger veterans with complex conditions 
related to improved battlefield medical care, and as a 
group contain a higher percentage of seriously wounded 
individuals needing complex lifelong physical and mental 
health care, which differs greatly from the patient mix 
cared for by most non-VA providers; 
Whereas over 9,300,000 veterans are enrolled in the health 
care system of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and 
of this number 7,100,000 actually use the health care 
system for all or part of their care, which is an increase 
of 82 percent since 2001, showing massive, growing need 
for care furnished by the VA; 
Whereas the RAND Corporation examined a decade of re-
search and found that VA-provided care is equal to or 
better quality than private sector care in all forty-seven 
quality-of-care measurements it conducted as part of an 
independent assessment comparing VA outpatient care 
with comparable civilian facilities; 
Whereas the RAND Corporation’s Ready to Serve national 
study found that compared to non-VA mental health pro-
viders, VA mental health providers were significantly 
more likely to deliver both culturally competent care, 
which is important for engaging veterans and increasing 
access to care, as well as evidenced-based care that yields 
clinically meaningful and significant improvement of 
Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and major depression; 
Whereas the Department of Veterans Affairs is better 
equipped than most non-VA providers to coordinate com-

plex veteran care and provide continuity of resources for 
veterans, yet an increasing number of veterans are being 
sent into the private sector each year, first pursuant to 
the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 
2014 (Public Law 113–146) and now pursuant to the VA 
MISSION Act of 2018 (Public Law 115–182); 
Whereas mental health services, including suicide prevention, 
are of paramount importance; 
Whereas the over 420,000 employees of the Department of 
Veterans Affairs are dedicated public servants; 
Whereas, according to a bipartisan survey by Lake Research 
and Chesapeake Beach Consulting, 80 percent of vet-
erans polled oppose turning health care provided by the 
Department of Veterans Affairs into a system of private 
sector vouchers that may not adequately cover costs; 
Whereas a Veterans of Foreign Wars survey found that 92 
percent of veterans believe working to fix the VA, rather 
than dismantling it, is the best way to improve the care 
provided to America’s veterans; 
Whereas millions of dollars are being spent by organizations 
which value dismantling the Department of Veterans Af-
fairs and outsourcing veteran care for private profit over 
investing in the Department; 
Whereas one of the top priorities should be the expansion of 
care for the more than 4,700,000 rural veterans by using 
rural clinics, VA mobile clinics, and telemedicine under 
the supervision of each veteran’s primary VA doctor; 
Whereas funding has not been increased sufficiently under 
the VA MISSION Act of 2018 (Public Law 115–182) for 
the Veteran Community Care Program that pays for the 
costs of providing veterans private health care at the

same time that the Administration is requesting inad-
equate funding for medical services at the Veterans 
Health Administration; 
Whereas the freedom of workers to organize unions is an 
internationally recognized human right, enshrined in the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights; 
Whereas the right of Federal employees to form and join 
unions and to engage in collective bargaining was estab-
lished by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (Public 
Law 95–454); 
Whereas 30 percent of workers at the VA are veterans them-
selves and as strong members of a union receive the good 
pay and benefits they deserve; 
Whereas it is vital to attract qualified individuals to fill work-
force shortages within the VA system; 
Whereas, on May 25, 2018, President Trump issued Execu-
tive Orders that proposed damaging changes to union-
izing and collective bargaining procedures including elimi-
nating nearly all union and workers use of ‘‘official’’ time 
and eliminating reasonable due process rights; and 
Whereas unions provide many benefits to our democracy, 
economy, and working families, and a union worker re-
ceives on average 18 percent higher weekly wages than 
nonunion workers: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
