tration to conduct a study relating to ultrafine particles, 
and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

rangements with the National Academy of Sciences to a

conduct a study that— 
2
(1) summarizes the relevant literature and 
3
studies done on airborne ultrafine particles world-
4
wide; 
5
(2) focuses on large hub commercial airports

in—

(A) Seattle;

(B) Boston;

(C) Chicago; 
10
(D) New York;

(E) the Northern California Metroplex;

(F) Phoenix; 
13
(G) the Southern California Metroplex; 
14
(H) the District of Columbia; 
15
(I) Atlanta; and 
16
(J) any other metropolitan large hub air-
17
port identified by the Administrator; 
18
(3) specifically looks at— 
19
(A) characteristics of UFPs present in the 
20
air; 
21
(B) spatial and temporal distributions of 
22
UFP concentrations; 
23
(C) primary sources of UFPs;

(D) how much aircraft and airport oper-
1
ations are contributing to the distribution of 
2
UFP concentrations when compared to other 
3
sources; 
4
(E) potential health effects associated with 
5
elevated UFP exposures, including heart and 
6
lung diseases, asthma, nervous system dis-
7
orders, and other health effects, that have been 
8
considered in previous studies; and 
9
(F) potential UFP exposures, especially to 
10
susceptible and vulnerable groups; 
11
(4) identifies measures, including the use of 
12
sustainable aviation fuels, intended to reduce emis-
13
sions from aircraft and airport operations and assess 
14
potential impacts on emissions related to UFPs; and 
15
(5) identifies important information gaps re-
16
lated to understanding relationships between UFP 
17
exposures and health effects, contributions of avia-
18
tion-related emissions to UFP exposures, and the ef-
19
fectiveness of mitigation measures.

(b) COORDINATION.—The Administrator of the Fed-
21
eral Aviation Administration shall coordinate with the Ad-
22
ministrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the 
23
Secretary of Health and Human Services, and any other

(c) REPORT.—Not later than 2 years after the date

of execution of the funding agreement between the Federal 
4
Aviation Administration and the National Academy of 
5
Sciences, the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Ad-
6
ministration shall submit to Congress a report on the

study.

(d) DEFINITION.—In this Act, the terms ‘‘ultrafine 
9
particle’’ and ‘‘UFP’’ mean particles with diameters less 
10
than or equal to 100 nanometers.
