Fire Protection Act of 2019’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) On July 27, 2012, the United States-Israel 
8
Enhanced Security Cooperation Act of 2012 (Public 
9
Law 112–150; 22 U.S.C. 8601 et seq.) declared it

to be the policy of the United States ‘‘to help the 
1
Government of Israel preserve its qualitative military 
2
edge amid rapid and uncertain regional political 
3
transformation’’ and ‘‘provide Israel defense articles 
4
and services, to include air refueling tankers, missile 
5
defense capabilities, and specialized munitions’’. 
6
(2) On December 19, 2014, the President 
7
signed into law the United States-Israel Strategic 
8
Partnership Act of 2014 (Public Law 113–296) 
9
which stated the sense of Congress that Israel is a 
10
major strategic partner of the United States and de-
11
clared it to be the policy of the United States ‘‘to 
12
continue to provide Israel with robust security as-
13
sistance, including for the procurement of the Iron 
14
Dome Missile Defense System’’. 
15
(3) In 2014, both governments signed a co-pro-
16
duction agreement to produce Iron Dome’s compo-
17
nents in the United States. 
18
(4) The United States has provided more than 
19
$1,400,000,000 to Israel for Iron Dome batteries, 
20
coproduction costs, and general maintenance. 
21
(5) More than 70 percent of the Iron Dome in-
22
terceptor is manufactured in the United States. 
23
(6) The Iron Dome system is now a fielded, 
24
battle-tested capability in Israel with more than 
25

•HR 3186 IH
1,700 confirmed air defense intercepts and provides 
1
a rapid approach to delivering air defense capabili-
2
ties for the United States. 
3
(7) As outlined in the National Defense Strat-
4
egy, the Army has critical capability gaps for cruise 
5
missile defense, as well as counter-unmanned aerial 
6
systems and counter-rocket, artillery, and mortars. 
7
(8) In October 2018, the Army reported to 
8
Congress that, ‘‘The Iron Dome System has capa-
9
bility against cruise missiles, unmanned aircraft sys-
10
tems, and rocket, artillery, and mortar fire,’’ and 
11
‘‘provides the best value to the Army as an interim 
12
capability.’’. 
13
(9) In February 2019, the Army Futures Com-
14
mand issued a statement noting an ‘‘intent to pro-
15
cure a limited number of Iron Dome weapon systems 
16
to fill its short-term need for an interim Indirect 
17
Fire Protection Capability.’’. 
18
(10) The Army reported to Congress that ‘‘Iron 
19
Dome meets the Army’s modernization vision of 
20
rapid deployment of a mature and affordable weapon 
21
system.’’. 
22
(11) Any delay in procuring the Iron Dome bat-
23
teries for the Army jeopardizes the ability of the 
24
Army to field an initial capability in 2020 and cre-

ates continued risk to warfighters by leaving this 
1
identified critical capability gap unfulfilled. 
2
(12) At an April 2, 2019, hearing by the Com-
3
mittee on Armed Services of the House of Rep-
4
resentatives, the Chief of Staff of the Army General 
5
Mark Milley stated, ‘‘The Iron Dome is a very capa-
6
ble system. It has basically a 100 percent track 
7
record in combat. We clearly need it to protect our 
8
formations, and we are buying the two batteries.’’. 
9
(13) Section 112 of the John S. McCain Na-
10
tional Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 
11
2019 (Public Law 115–232) provides that— 
12
(A) if the Secretary of Defense certifies the 
13
need for the Army to deploy an interim missile 
14
defense capability, the Secretary of the Army 
15
shall deploy at least two batteries to provide 
16
such capability not later than September 30, 
17
2020, and an additional two batteries not later 
18
than September 30, 2023; and 
19
(B) to meet such deadlines for deployment, 
20
the Secretary of the Army may— 
21
(i) deploy such systems that ‘‘require 
22
the least amount of development’’; and 
23
(ii) use any authority of the Secretary 
24
relating to acquisition, technology transfer,
