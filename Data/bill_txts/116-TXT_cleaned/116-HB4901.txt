SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
The Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) United States national sovereignty in Puer-
3
to Rico was established by the Treaty of Peace be-
4
tween the United States and the Kingdom of Spain 
5
(30 Stat. 1754), signed on December 10, 1898. 
6
(2) Puerto Rico is governed by the United 
7
States under laws enacted by Congress in the exer-
8
cise of its power to make rules and regulations gov-
9
erning territory belonging to the United States, pur-
10
suant to article IV, section 3, clause 2 of the Con-
11
stitution. 
12
(3) For reasons of precedent primarily related 
13
to the Philippines also ceded by Spain after the 
14
Spanish-American War, substantially the same ma-
15
jority in the United States Supreme Court that es-
16
tablished the ‘‘separate but equal’’ doctrine in Plessy 
17
v. Ferguson determined in the 1901 Downes v. 
18
Bidwell decision that Puerto Rico was an unincor-
19
porated territory of the United States, a status of 
20
possession that continues today. 
21
(4) On March 2, 1917, Congress granted birth-
22
right citizenship of the United States by statute for 
23
all persons born in Puerto Rico (39 Stat. 951) to 
24
further integrate Puerto Rico into our Nation.

•HR 4901 IH
(5) Puerto Rico has a territorial constitution 
1
that is republican in form and compatible with the 
2
United States Constitution as well as the principles 
3
of the Declaration of Independence, and that is 
4
equivalent to a State constitution, having been 
5
democratically ratified by the United States citizens 
6
of the territory on November 4, 1952, and subse-
7
quently approved by the Congress of the United 
8
States through Public Law 82–447. 
9
(6) Thirty-two territories previously have peti-
10
tioned Congress for statehood based on democrat-
11
ically expressed consent of the governed, and each 
12
was duly admitted as a State of the Union pursuant 
13
to article IV, section 3, clause 1 of the United States 
14
Constitution, with equal rights and responsibilities of 
15
national and State citizenship under the United 
16
States Constitution. 
17
(7) Puerto Ricans have contributed greatly to 
18
the Nation and its culture and distinguished them-
19
selves in every field of endeavor. However, the denial 
20
of equal voting representation and equal treatment 
21
by the Federal Government stands in stark contrast 
22
to their contributions. 
23
(8) Since becoming a United States territory, 
24
more than 235,000 United States citizens of Puerto 
25

•HR 4901 IH
Rican heritage have served in the United States 
1
military. 
2
(9) Thousands of military servicemembers of 
3
Puerto Rican heritage have received numerous med-
4
als, distinctions, and commendations of every degree, 
5
including for valorous military service in the twen-
6
tieth and twenty-first centuries. 
7
(10) Nine military servicemembers from Puerto 
8
Rico have been awarded the Congressional Medal of 
9
Honor, and many have been awarded the Distin-
10
guished Service Cross or the Navy Cross. 
11
(11) The 65th Infantry Regiment in Puerto 
12
Rico (known as the ‘‘Borinqueneers’’) was awarded 
13
the Congressional Gold Medal (Public Law 113–120, 
14
enacted June 10, 2014) for its contributions and 
15
sacrifices in the armed conflicts of the United 
16
States, including World War I, World War II, and 
17
the Korean War. 
18
(12) Unincorporated territory status means 
19
that Federal laws can be applied to Puerto Rico and 
20
its American citizens differently, on unequal and 
21
even inequitable terms, compared not only to the 
22
States and their residents, but also unlike territories 
23
that were considered to be parts of the United 
24
01:40 Nov 01, 2019
H4901
5 
•HR 4901 IH
States. This has limited the development of Puerto 
1
Rico and hindered its economy. 
2
(13) Unincorporated territory status has re-
3
sulted in millions of residents leaving Puerto Rico to 
4
seek greater opportunities and a better quality of life 
5
available in a State. Approximately 65 percent of all 
6
people of Puerto Rican origin now live in the States, 
7
with the increasing rate of population loss in the ter-
8
ritory creating a severe strain on the local tax base 
9
and workforce participation. 
10
(14) Other than its unincorporated territory 
11
status and its unequal treatment in some laws, 
12
Puerto Rico is socially, economically, politically, and 
13
legally integrated into the Nation. 
14
(15) Puerto Rico has held two plebiscites under 
15
local law on status proposals that are possible under 
16
Federal law in 2012 and 2017. In 2012, a majority 
17
of the vote rejected the current territory status and 
18
61.2 percent chose statehood among the alternatives. 
19
In 2017, 97.1 percent of the vote was for statehood 
20
on a ballot amended as advised by the Department 
21
of Justice. 
22
(16) No United States territory that has peti-
23
tioned for statehood has been denied admission into 
24
the Union.

(17) Congress has recognized Puerto Rico’s 
1
‘‘right to determine its future political status’’ (Pub-
2
lic Law 114–187, enacted June 20, 2016), which, 
3
consistent with status votes in most territories that 
4
have become States, may include a ‘‘Yes or No’’ vote 
5
on statehood. 
6
(18) Congress has appropriated funding to the 
7
State Elections Commission of Puerto Rico to con-
8
duct a plebiscite by which Puerto Rican voters will 
9
determine the future political status of Puerto Rico 
10
(Public Law 113–76, enacted January 17, 2014). 
11
(19) Granting equality through statehood to 
12
Puerto Rico is long overdue in light of the historical 
13
contributions of its residents to the United States 
14
and its potential to further strengthen our Union 
15
and the 102 years of political and economic discrimi-
16
nation against the United States citizens living in 
17
Puerto Rico.

SEC. 3. NATIONAL POLICY DECLARATION.
