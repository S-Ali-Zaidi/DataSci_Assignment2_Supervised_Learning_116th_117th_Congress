SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Domestic Terrorism 
2
Prevention Act of 2019’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) White supremacists and other far-right-wing 
6
extremists are the most significant domestic ter-
7
rorism threat facing the United States. 
8
(2) On February 22, 2019, a Trump Adminis-
9
tration United States Department of Justice official 
10
wrote in a New York Times op-ed that ‘‘white su-
11
premacy and far-right extremism are among the 
12
greatest domestic-security threats facing the United 
13
States. Regrettably, over the past 25 years, law en-
14
forcement, at both the Federal and State levels, has 
15
been slow to respond. . . . Killings committed by in-
16
dividuals and groups associated with far-right ex-
17
tremist groups have risen significantly.’’. 
18
(3) An April 2017 Government Accountability 
19
Office report on the significant, lethal threat posed 
20
by domestic violent extremists explained that 
21
‘‘[s]ince September 12, 2001, the number of fatali-
22
ties caused by domestic violent extremists has 
23
ranged from 1 to 49 in a given year.’’ The report 
24
noted: ‘‘[F]atalities resulting from attacks by far 
25
right wing violent extremists have exceeded those 
26
03:01 Apr 12, 2019
H1931
3 
•HR 1931 IH
caused by radical Islamist violent extremists in 10 of 
1
the 15 years, and were the same in 3 of the years 
2
since September 12, 2001. Of the 85 violent extrem-
3
ist incidents that resulted in death since September 
4
12, 2001, far right wing violent extremist groups 
5
were responsible for 62 (73 percent) while radical 
6
Islamist violent extremists were responsible for 23 
7
(27 percent).’’. 
8
(4) An unclassified May 2017 joint intelligence 
9
bulletin from the Federal Bureau of Investigation 
10
and the Department of Homeland Security found 
11
that ‘‘white supremacist extremism poses [a] per-
12
sistent threat of lethal violence,’’ and that White su-
13
premacists ‘‘were responsible for 49 homicides in 26 
14
attacks from 2000 to 2016 . . . more than any 
15
other domestic extremist movement’’. 
16
(5) Fatal terrorist attacks by far-right-wing ex-
17
tremists include— 
18
(A) the August 5, 2012, mass shooting at 
19
a Sikh gurdwara in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, in 
20
which a White supremacist shot and killed 6 
21
members of the gurdwara; 
22
(B) the April 13, 2014, mass shooting at 
23
a Jewish community center and a Jewish as-
24
sisted living facility in Overland Park, Kansas, 
25

in which a neo-Nazi shot and killed 3 civilians, 
1
including a 14-year-old teenager; 
2
(C) the June 8, 2014, ambush in Las 
3
Vegas, Nevada, in which 2 supporters of the 
4
far-right-wing ‘‘patriot’’ movement shot and 
5

6
(D) the June 17, 2015, mass shooting at 
7
the Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South 
8

10
(E) the November 27, 2015, mass shooting 
11

12

13
tremist shot and killed a police officer and 2 ci-
14
vilians; 
15
(F) the March 20, 2017, murder of an Af-
16
rican-American man in New York City, alleg-
17
edly committed by a White supremacist who re-
18
portedly traveled to New York ‘‘for the purpose 
19
of killing black men’’; 
20
(G) the May 26, 2017, attack in Portland, 
21
Oregon, in which a White supremacist allegedly 
22
murdered 2 men and injured a third after the 
23
men defended 2 young women whom the indi-

vidual had targeted with anti-Muslim hate 
1
speech; 
2
(H) the August 12, 2017, attack in Char-
3
lottesville, Virginia, in which a White suprema-
4
cist killed one and injured nineteen after driv-
5
ing his car through a crowd of individuals pro-
6
testing a neo-Nazi rally, and of which former 
7
Attorney General Jeff Sessions said, ‘‘It does 
8
meet the definition of domestic terrorism in our 
9
statute.’’; 
10
(I) the July 2018 murder of an African- 
11
American woman from Kansas City, Missouri, 
12
allegedly committed by a White supremacist 
13
who reportedly bragged about being a member 
14
of the Ku Klux Klan; 
15
(J) the October 24, 2018, shooting in 
16
Jeffersontown, Kentucky, in which a White 
17
man allegedly murdered 2 African Americans at 
18
a grocery store after first attempting to enter 
19
a church with a predominantly African-Amer-
20
ican congregation during a service; and 
21
(K) the October 27, 2018, mass shooting 
22
at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, 
23
Pennsylvania, in which a White nationalist al-
24

•HR 1931 IH
legedly shot and killed 11 members of the con-
1
gregation. 
2
(6) In November 2018, the Federal Bureau of 
3
Investigation released its annual hate crime incident 
4
report, which found that in 2017, hate crimes in-
5
creased by approximately 17 percent, including a 23- 
6
percent increase in religion-based hate crimes, an 
7
18-percent increase in race-based crimes, and a 5- 
8
percent increase in crimes directed against LGBT 
9
individuals. The total number of reported hate 
10
crimes rose for the third consecutive year. The pre-
11
vious year’s report found that in 2016, hate crimes 
12
increased by almost 5 percent, including a 19-per-
13
cent rise in hate crimes against American Muslims; 
14
additionally, of the hate crimes motivated by reli-
15
gious bias in 2016, 53 percent were anti-Semitic. 
16
Similarly, the report analyzing 2015 data found that 
17
hate crimes increased by 6 percent that year. Much 
18
of the 2015 increase came from a 66-percent rise in 
19
attacks on American Muslims and a 9-percent rise 
20
in attacks on American Jews. In all three reports, 
21
race-based crimes were most numerous, and those 
22
crimes most often targeted African Americans. 
23
(7) On March 15, 2019, a White nationalist 
24
was arrested and charged with murder after alleg-
25
02:29 Apr 10, 2019
H1931
7 
•HR 1931 IH
edly killing 50 Muslim worshippers and injuring 
1
more than 40 in a massacre at the Al Noor Mosque 
2
and Linwood Mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand. 
3
The alleged shooter posted a hate-filled, xenophobic 
4
manifesto that detailed his White nationalist ide-
5
ology before the massacre. Prime Minister Jacinda 
6
Ardern labeled the massacre a terrorist attack. 
7
(8) In January 2017, a right-wing extremist 
8
who had expressed anti-Muslim views was charged 
9
with murder for allegedly killing 6 people and injur-
10
ing 19 in a shooting rampage at a mosque in Quebec 
11
City, Canada. It was the first-ever mass shooting at 
12
a mosque in North America, and Prime Minister 
13
Trudeau labeled it a terrorist attack. 
14
(9) On February 15, 2019, Federal authorities 
15
arrested U.S. Coast Guard Lieutenant Christopher 
16
Paul Hasson, who was allegedly planning to kill a 
17
number of prominent journalists, professors, judges, 
18
and ‘‘leftists in general’’. In court filings, prosecu-
19
tors described Lieutenant Hasson as a ‘‘domestic 
20
terrorist’’ who in an email ‘‘identified himself as a 
21
White Nationalist for over 30 years and advocated 
22
for ‘focused violence’ in order to establish a white 
23
homeland.’’.
