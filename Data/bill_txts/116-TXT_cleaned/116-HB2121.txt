Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Strategy To Oppose

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
7
Congress finds the following: 
8
(1) The World Health Organization (WHO) es-
9
timates that approximately 10 percent of all trans-
10
planted kidneys worldwide are illegally obtained,

often bought from vulnerable impoverished persons 
1
or in some cases forcibly harvested from prisoners. 
2
(2) In 2004, the World Health Assembly passed 
3
a resolution urging its member-states to take meas-
4
ures to protect the poorest as well as vulnerable 
5
groups from exploitation by organ traffickers. 
6
(3) On February 13, 2008, the United Nations 
7
Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking 
8
(UNGIFT) hosted the ‘‘Vienna Forum to Fight 
9
Human Trafficking’’, and subsequently reported 
10
that a lack of adequate illicit organ trafficking laws 
11
has provided opportunity for the illegal trade to 
12
grow. 
13
(4) On March 21, 2011, the Council of the Eu-
14
ropean Union adopted rules supplementing the defi-
15
nition of criminal offenses and the level of sanctions 
16
in order to strengthen the prevention of organ traf-
17
ficking and the protection of those victims. 
18
(5) In 2005, the United States ratified the Pro-
19
tocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in 
20
Persons, Especially Women and Children, a supple-
21
ment to the United Nations Convention against 
22
Transnational Organized Crime, which includes the 
23
removal of organs as a form of exploitation under 
24
the definition of ‘‘trafficking in persons’’.

•HR 2121 IH
(6) According to a 2013 United Nations report 
1
from the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in per-
2
sons, especially women and children, the economic 
3
and social divisions within and among countries is 
4
notably reflected in the illicit organ trafficking mar-
5
ket, in which the victims are commonly poor, unem-
6
ployed, and more susceptible to deceit and extortion. 
7
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
8
It is the sense of Congress that— 
9
(1) the kidnapping or coercion of individuals for 
10
the purpose of extracting their organs for profit is 
11
in contradiction of the ideals and standards for eth-
12
ical behavior upon which the United States has 
13
based its laws; 
14
(2) the illegal harvesting of organs from chil-
15
dren is a violation of the human rights of the child 
16
and is a breach of internationally accepted medical 
17
ethical standards described in WHO Assembly Reso-
18
lution 57.18 (May 22, 2004); 
19
(3) the illegal harvesting and trafficking of or-
20
gans violates Article 3 of the Universal Declaration 
21
of Human Rights, which states that ‘‘Everyone has 
22
the right to life, liberty and security of person.’’, and 
23
Article 4, which states that ‘‘No one shall be held in 
24
slavery or servitude.’’; and

(4) establishing efficient voluntary organ dona-
1
tion systems with strong enforcement mechanisms is 
2
the most effective way to combat trafficking in per-
3
sons for purposes of the removal of organs. 
4
SEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
5
It shall be the policy of the United States to— 
6
(1) combat the international trafficking in per-
7
sons for purposes of the removal of organs; 
8
(2) promote the establishment of voluntary 
9
organ donation systems with effective enforcement 
10
mechanisms in bilateral diplomatic meetings, as well 
11
as in international health forums; and 
12
(3) promote the dignity and security of human 
13
life in accordance with the Universal Declaration of 
14
Human Rights.

16
VIDUALS WHO ARE ORGAN TRAFFICKERS. 
17

18
validity of passports, and for other purposes’’, approved 
19
