RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for designation of July as National 
Sarcoma Awareness Month. 
Whereas sarcoma is a cancer of connective tissues, such as 
nerves, muscles, joints, fat, bones, and blood vessels, and 
it can arise anywhere in the body; 
Whereas 15,000 people in the United States were diagnosed 
with sarcoma last year, more than 6,000 died, and 
50,000 are struggling with the disease at any one time; 
Whereas 1 percent of cancers diagnosed in adults and 20 per-
cent of cancers diagnosed in children each year are sar-
coma; 
Whereas more than 50 subtypes of sarcoma have been identi-
fied;

Whereas the National Cancer Institute recognizes that sar-
coma is often misdiagnosed and underreported; and 
Whereas July would be an appropriate month to designate as 
National Sarcoma Awareness Month to raise awareness 
of the disease and encourage more individuals to get 
properly diagnosed and treated: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives supports

the designation of National Sarcoma Awareness Month.
