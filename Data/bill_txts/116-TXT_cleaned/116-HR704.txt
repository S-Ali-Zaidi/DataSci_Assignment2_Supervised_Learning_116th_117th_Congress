RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the goals of National Adoption Month 
and National Adoption Day by promoting national 
awareness of adoption and the children waiting for adop-
tion, celebrating children and families involved in adop-
tion, and encouraging the people of the United States 
to secure safety, permanency, and well-being for all chil-
dren. 
Whereas there are far too many unparented children in the 
United States; 
Whereas the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Report-
ing System Report on fiscal year 2018 foster care and 
adoption population characteristics (referred to in this 
preamble as the ‘‘AFCARS report’’) indicates that there

are approximately 437,300 children in the foster care 
system in the United States, approximately 125,400 of 
whom are waiting for adoption; 
Whereas the AFCARS report indicates that— 
(1) 65 percent of the children in foster care in the 
United States are 10 years of age or younger; 
(2) the average length of time a child spends in fos-
ter care is approximately 20 months; 
(3) in 2018, approximately 17,800 youth ‘‘aged out’’ 
of foster care by reaching adulthood without being placed 
in a permanent home; and 
(4) in 2018, the number of children who— 
(A) achieved permanency through adoption in-
creased for the fourth year in a row; and 
(B) entered foster care decreased for the second 
year in a row; 
Whereas, still, for many foster children, the wait for a loving 
family in which they are nurtured, comforted, and pro-
tected seems endless; 
Whereas a survey conducted in 2017 (referred to in this pre-
amble as the ‘‘2017 survey’’) showed that a quarter of 
respondents who had not adopted had considered adop-
tion; 
Whereas the 2017 survey showed that 46 percent of respond-
ents either somewhat or strongly agreed that children 
enter the foster care system because of juvenile delin-
quency, despite the AFCARS report revealing that ne-
glect was associated with 62 percent of cases involving 
the removal of a child, or approximately 163,500 cases; 
Whereas the 2017 survey showed that—

•HRES 704 IH 
(1) 39 percent of respondents believed foster care 
adoption is expensive; and 
(2) a majority of respondents considering foster care 
adoption indicated that receiving financial and emotional 
support would make a difference in their decision to pur-
sue adoption; 
Whereas the Children’s Bureau, an office of the Administra-
tion for Children and Families within the Department of 
Health and Human Services, supports programs, re-
search, and monitoring to help eliminate barriers to 
adoption and find permanent families for children; 
Whereas, every day, loving and nurturing families are 
strengthened and expanded when committed and dedi-
cated individuals make an important difference in the life 
of a child through adoption; 
Whereas the President traditionally issues an annual procla-
mation to declare the month of November as National 
Adoption Month; 
Whereas National Adoption Day has been celebrated as a col-
lective national effort to find permanent and loving fami-
lies for children in the foster care system; and 
Whereas the Saturday before Thanksgiving has been recog-
nized as National Adoption Day since at least 2000, and, 
in 2019, the Saturday before Thanksgiving is November 
23: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the goals and ideals of National 
2
Adoption Month and National Adoption Day; 
3
(2) recognizes that every child should have a 
4
permanent and loving family; and
