Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) From April 2015 to November 2018 the 
3
United States provided in-flight refueling to the mili-
4

5
coalition’s air strikes in Yemen.

(2) A 2018 report by the United Nations-con-
7
vened Group of International and Regional Eminent

Experts on Yemen found that during this timeframe, 
9
most of the 6,600 civilians deaths and 10,563 civil-
10
ian injuries officially reported in Yemen were due to 
11
Saudi-led coalition airstrikes. The report indicated 
12
that the real numbers were likely significantly high-
13
er.

(3) Due to the repeated failures of the Saudi- 
15
led coalition to avoid civilian casualties, the Obama 
16
administration suspended the sale of precision-guid-
17
ed munitions to Saudi Arabia in December 2016. 
18
(4) In May 2017, then-Saudi Foreign Minister 
19
Adel al-Jubeir sent a letter to then-Secretary of 
20
State Rex Tillerson outlining the steps the Saudi 
21
military was taking to change its operational con-
22
duct, mitigate civilian harm and avoid civilian cas-
23
ualties in Yemen.
