Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘National Land Bank

Network Act of 2020’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Vacant and abandoned properties desta-
8
bilize rural, suburban, and urban neighborhoods 
9
across the United States by creating fire and other

public safety hazards, driving down property values, 
1
and draining local tax dollars. 
2
(2) The cost of repairs to maintain such prop-
3
erties, as well as the potential unpaid taxes and pub-
4
lic liens on such properties, often exceed the prop-
5
erty values of such properties, driving away pur-
6
chasers. 
7
(3) Additionally, the lack of an insurable and 
8
marketable title frequently prevents such properties 
9
from returning to productive use. 
10
(4) Low-income neighborhoods and commu-
11
nities of color disproportionately bear the burden of 
12
living near such properties and the associated haz-
13
ards. 
14
(5) Land banks— 
15
(A) have been developed to respond to the 
16
challenges posed by such properties; and 
17
(B) are primarily focused on the return of 
18
vacant, abandoned, and tax delinquent prop-
19
erties to productive use in accordance with lo-
20
cally determined goals and priorities. 
21
(6) Land banks, regardless of location, size of 
22
inventory, or duration of existence, share challenges 
23
in accessing best practices, research, technical assist-
24
ance, and other resources.
