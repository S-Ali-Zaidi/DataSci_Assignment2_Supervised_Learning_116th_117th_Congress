RESOLUTION 
Expressing disapproval of the Trump administration’s 
harmful actions towards Medicaid. 
Whereas Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Pro-
gram (CHIP) provide comprehensive, quality health care 
to 71 million Americans and children; 
Whereas Medicaid expansion has provided coverage to mil-
lions of adults and reduced the uninsured rate for both 
adults and children; 
Whereas Medicaid is a lifeline for some of our most vulner-
able populations, including children with complex medical 
needs, people living with disabilities, low-income seniors, 
and individuals with mental illness and substance use dis-
orders;

•HRES 826 IH 
Whereas Medicaid expansion has improved access to diag-
noses and treatment for people with life-threatening con-
ditions, including cancer, heart disease, and substance 
use disorder; 
Whereas Medicaid expansion improves health outcomes and 
saves lives; 
Whereas research shows that Medicaid expansion has saved 
at least 19,000 lives since 2014; 
Whereas Medicaid is the largest payer of behavioral health 
services in the country; 
Whereas Medicaid is the largest payer of long-term services 
and supports, including those provided in community- 
based settings; 
Whereas the opioid epidemic has claimed hundreds of thou-
sands of lives, and Medicaid provides access to evidence- 
based treatment for individuals struggling with opioid use 
disorder; 
Whereas researchers found that Medicaid expansion is linked 
to a 6-percent reduction in the opioid death rate, an 11- 
percent lower death rate for heroin, and a 10-percent 
lower death rate for fentanyl; 
Whereas Medicaid and CHIP play a key role in maternity 
services, pay for nearly half of all births in the United 
States, and provide access to prenatal and postpartum 
care; 
Whereas nearly all States and the District of Columbia pro-
vide Medicaid coverage to pregnant women with incomes 
higher than minimum Federal standards; 
Whereas maternal mortality rates have risen nationally and 
disproportionately affect women of color;

•HRES 826 IH 
Whereas access to health care can help prevent, detect, and 
treat conditions that put women at increased risk for 
pregnancy-related complications; 
Whereas research shows that Medicaid expansion improves 
postpartum care for women, reduces maternal and infant 
death, and reduces the likelihood a woman will experience 
a gap in coverage; 
Whereas rural hospitals are closing at an alarming rate, jeop-
ardizing access to care for the 20 percent of Americans 
who live in rural areas, including 13,000,000 children, 
and research has found that States that expanded Med-
icaid had fewer rural hospital closures, and that rural 
hospitals in those States experienced improved financial 
performance; 
Whereas Medicaid expansion reduces medical debt for individ-
uals receiving coverage, which improves their individual 
and family financial security; 
Whereas once in office, President Trump has gone further 
than any President in the history of the program to make 
life harder for working families who rely on Medicaid for 
their health and well-being; 
Whereas the President has waged an unrelenting war on 
Medicaid, making it easier for States to take coverage 
away and create barriers for reenrollment; 
Whereas, on President Trump’s watch, the number of unin-
sured children has increased, reversing years of declines, 
largely as a result of substantial losses in Medicaid cov-
erage for children—many of whom remain eligible; 
Whereas under President Trump, over 1,000,000 children 
have lost Medicaid and CHIP coverage and over 750,000 
adults have lost Medicaid coverage; and

•HRES 826 IH 
Whereas, despite President Trump’s campaign promise that 
he would ‘‘save Medicaid’’, his administration has— 
(1) issued guidance to allow States to cap their Med-
icaid funding through a block grant, putting the financial 
viability of the States’ programs at risk and taking cov-
erage and access to health care away from our citizens; 
(2) proposed regulations to roll back access stand-
ards put in place to ensure beneficiaries receive the care 
they need; 
(3) issued guidance to allow State Medicaid pro-
grams to restrict access to prescription drugs by adopting 
closed formularies; 
(4) proposed massive, annually compounding cuts in 
Federal funding to the program in direct contradiction to 
an explicit campaign promise; and 
(5) allowed States to institute policies that have re-
sulted in people improperly losing Medicaid coverage: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-
1
resentatives that— 
2
(1) the illegal actions taken by the Trump ad-
3
ministration to undermine the Medicaid program, in-
4
cluding beneficiary protections, are a cruel attack on 
5
a program that provides for the health and well- 
6
being for some of our most vulnerable citizens; 
7
(2) the Trump administration should imme-
8
diately withdraw its illegal block grant guidance and 
9
cease its campaign to undermine and weaken Med-
10
icaid; and 
11
20:19 Feb 03, 2020

(3) the Trump administration should uphold its

responsibility to faithfully execute the law, including 
2
the Medicaid Act, and cease any and all efforts that 
3
threaten the care of the millions of Americans who 
4
rely on Medicaid.
