CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of Congress that any United States- 
Saudi Arabia civilian nuclear cooperation agreement 
must prohibit the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia from enrich-
ing uranium or separating plutonium on its own terri-
tory, in keeping with the strongest possible nonprolifera-
tion ‘‘gold standard’’. 
Whereas, on May 21, 2009, the United States and the United 
Arab Emirates signed a bilateral agreement pursuant to 
section 123 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 
U.S.C. 2153), establishing cooperation on civilian nuclear 
programs in which the United Arab Emirates agreed that 
it ‘‘shall not possess sensitive nuclear facilities within its 
territory or otherwise engage in activities within its terri-
tory for, or relating to, the enrichment or reprocessing of

material, or for the alternation in form or content (except 
by irradiation or further irradiation or, if agreed by the 
Parties, post-irradiation examination) of plutonium, ura-
nium 233, high enriched uranium, or irradiated source or 
special fissionable material’’; 
Whereas the civil nuclear cooperation agreement between the 
United States and the United Arab Emirates further ob-
ligates the United Arab Emirates to bring into force its 
Additional Protocol to its International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) Safeguards Agreement before the United 
States licenses ‘‘exports of nuclear material, equipment, 
components, or technology’’ pursuant to the agreement; 
and 
Whereas this agreement became known as the first ‘‘gold 
standard’’ civil nuclear agreement and was lauded as a 
step toward establishing a precedent for strong non-
proliferation standards on the Arabian Peninsula: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate 
1
concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that any

agreement under section 123 of the Atomic Energy Act
