A BILL 
To improve and coordinate United States information 
statecraft strategy and capabilities for an era of strategic 
competition, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘United States Informa-
4
tion Abroad for Strategic Competition Act’’ or the ‘‘USIA 
5
for Strategic Competition Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
7
Congress finds the following: 
8
(1) Beginning in 1983, the Soviet Union waged 
9
a disinformation campaign against the United States 
10
21:12 Aug 27, 2020

•HR 7938 IH
which 
came 
to 
be 
known 
as 
‘‘Operation 
1
INFEKTION’’, falsely accusing the Department of 
2
Defense of engineering and spreading the AIDS 
3
virus. 
4
(2) In 1987, the Soviet Union publicly dis-
5
avowed its AIDS disinformation following the efforts 
6
of the United States Active Measures Working 
7
Group to refute these lies and discredit the Soviet 
8
Union. 
9
(3) Shortly thereafter, the Working Group en-
10
tered a period of institutional decline because its 
11
work was perceived to contravene Department of 
12
State efforts to engage with the Soviet Union, and 
13
effectively ceased to exist following the fall of the 
14
Soviet Union. 
15
(4) The final report issued by members of the 
16
Working Group, published by the United States In-
17
formation Agency in 1992 at the request of the 
18
House of Representatives, warned that ‘‘[a]s long as 
19
states and groups interested in manipulating world 
20
opinion, limiting U.S. Government actions, or gener-
21
ating opposition to U.S. policies and interests con-
22
tinue to use these techniques, there will be a need 
23
for the United States Information Agency to system-
24
atically monitor, analyze, and counter them.’’.

(5) In 2020, the Communist Party of China

2
United States, falsely accusing the United States of 
3
being the source of the SARS–CoV–2 novel 
4
coronavirus and the United States Army of bringing 
5
the virus to China.

SEC. 3. INFORMATION STATECRAFT.

8
establishes that it is a priority of United States Informa-

tion Statecraft to ‘‘improve our understanding of how ad-

14
advance United States foreign policy and national security

that undermine United States values, such as the 
1
promotion of authoritarian governance, the denigra-
2
tion of individual liberty, and the disregard of inter-
3
nationally recognized human rights. 
4
(4) Discrediting foreign state and nonstate ac-
5
tors 
responsible 
for 
such 
propaganda, 
6
disinformation, and narratives, and seeking to re-
7
duce the ability of such actors to influence global 
8

9
(5) Coordinating and integrating such efforts 
10
with the efforts of United States allies and partners 
11

SEC. 4. ACTIVE MEASURES WORKING GROUP FOR THE CHI-
5
NESE COMMUNIST PARTY. 
6
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) The ‘‘Communique´ on the Current State of 
8
the Ideological Sphere’’, an April 22, 2013, notice 
9
from the Communist Party of China’s (CCP) Cen-
10
tral Committee more commonly known as ‘‘Docu-
11
ment 9’’, establishes that under the leadership of 
12
General Secretary Xi Jinping, the CCP considers 
13
constitutional democracy, internationally recognized 
14
human rights, liberal economics, independent jour-
15
nalism, and internal dissent to be security threats. 
16
(2) In his remarks before the 19th Communist 
17
Party Congress in 2017, which were titled in part 
18
‘‘Strive for the Great Success of Socialism with Chi-
19
nese Characteristics for a New Era’’, General Sec-
20
retary Xi Jinping said, ‘‘the banner of socialism with 
21
Chinese characteristics is now flying high and proud 
22
for all to see. It means that the path, the theory, the 
23
system, and the culture of socialism with Chinese 
24
characteristics have kept developing, blazing a new
