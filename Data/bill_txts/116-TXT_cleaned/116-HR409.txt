Whereas racial disparities persist in young people’s sexual 
health, highlighting ongoing inequities in access to sex 
education as well as sexual health services; 
Whereas access to quality information and education about 
young people’s sexual health is a critical step toward ad-
dressing disparities; 
Whereas despite historic declines, the United States has the 
highest rate of unintended teen pregnancy among com-
parable countries and limited resources available for 
young parents; 
Whereas young people aged 15 through 25 contract half of 
the 19 million sexually transmitted infections each year, 
despite making up only a quarter of the sexually active 
population; 
Whereas young people under the age of 25 accounted for 1 
in 5 new HIV infections; 
Whereas three-quarters of LGBT students report harass-
ment, 56 percent report feeling unsafe, and nearly a 
third skipped at least one day of school in the month 
prior to reporting due to concerns for their safety; 
Whereas approximately 1 in 3 young women in the United 
States experiences physical, emotional, or verbal abuse 
from a dating partner; 
Whereas sex education that includes information beyond ab-
stinence has been found to delay sexual intercourse, in-
crease condom or contraceptive use, reduce the number 
of partners among young people, and decrease physical 
aggression with intimate partners; 
Whereas young people who received sex education are 50 per-
cent less likely to experience an unintended pregnancy, 
31 percent less likely to contract a sexually transmitted

infection, and more likely to delay sexual activity and use 
contraception upon becoming sexually active; 
Whereas comprehensive sex education provides information 
about the prevention of unintended pregnancy, sexually 
transmitted infections, including HIV, dating violence, 
sexual assault, bullying, and harassment, and provides re-
sources and information on topics ranging from gender 
stereotyping and gender roles to stigma and sociocultural 
influences surrounding sex and sexuality; 
Whereas comprehensive sex education promotes and upholds 
the rights of young people to information in order to be-
come sexually healthy adults and have healthy relation-
ships; and 
Whereas May of each year is now recognized as Sex Ed For 
All Month: Now, therefore, be it
