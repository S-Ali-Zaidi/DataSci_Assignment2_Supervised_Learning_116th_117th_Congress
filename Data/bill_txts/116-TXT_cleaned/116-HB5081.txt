(1) On October 27, 2019, United States special 
1
operations forces carried out a raid, which resulted 
2
in the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. 
3
(2) A military working dog, whose identity is 
4
classified, played an integral role in the success of 
5
the raid and kept United States military personnel 
6
out of harm’s way. 
7
(3) Although injured during the raid, the mili-
8
tary working dog is recovering and continues to 
9
serve heroically alongside his handler in theater. 
10
(4) Working dogs, such as the one involved in 
11
the Al-Baghdadi raid, play a critical role in assisting 
12
our Armed Forces and Federal and local law en-
13
forcement in protecting Americans and defending 
14
freedom at home and abroad. 
15
(5) Within the Federal Government, working 
16
dogs assist the U.S. Capitol Police, the Bureau of 
17
Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the 
18
Transportation Security Administration, the Depart-
19
ment of Defense, U.S. Customs and Border Protec-
20
tion, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, 
21
amongst other Federal departments and agencies. 
22
(6) Almost all working dogs work in tandem 
23
with our Armed Forces and law enforcement officers

until they are no longer medically able, at which 
1
point they are medically separated. 
2
(7) The future of retired working dogs with re-
3
spect to ownership and provision of medical services 
4
is often unclear and the medical treatment required 
5
by many former working dogs is significant enough 
6
that it creates a hardship for the individuals, often 
7
former partners, who take in these canine heroes.
