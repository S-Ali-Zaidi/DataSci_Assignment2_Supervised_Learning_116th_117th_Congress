•HR 6174 IH
(1) There are currently 1.8 billion youth in the 
1
world, the largest number ever to have existed. 
2
(2) Youth represent the majority of the popu-
3
lation in many conflict-affected countries, where on 
4
average 50 percent of the population is below the 
5
age of 20, and in some countries more than 70 per-
6
cent of the population is below the age of 30. 
7
(3) Around the world, youth remain under-rep-
8
resented in peace building and conflict prevention, 
9
management, and resolution, and post-conflict relief 
10
and recovery efforts. 
11
(4) Violence impacts over 1 billion people glob-
12
ally each year. 
13
(5) Youth and youth-led groups and movements 
14
led by them have demonstrated the capacity to play 
15
critical roles in— 
16
(A) de-escalating conflict from spreading; 
17
(B) preventing recurring cycles of violence 
18
in communities; 
19
(C) effectively encouraging defection from 
20
armed groups; 
21
(D) improving the effectiveness and sus-
22
tainability of peace agreements; 
23
(E) improving social cohesion and resil-
24
ience to violence and recruitment; and 
25

H6174

•HR 6174 IH
(F) strengthening a culture of peace and 
1
security. 
2
(6) Youth are critical actors in grassroots com-
3
munity development, despite operational risks and 
4
limited technical and financial support for their 
5
work. 
6
(7) Preventive and resilience-based approaches 
7
to youth are more effective at reducing violence than 
8
hard security responses and at-risk and remedial ap-
9
proaches, which are often counterproductive. 
10
(8) Youth who have participated in United 
11
States-supported civic engagement and development 
12
programs were less likely to participate in or support 
13
political violence. 
14
(9) Youth participation in the design and imple-
15
mentation of community development strategies is 
16
critical for effectively reducing violence and extre-
17
mism, and increasing peace. 
18
(10) United Nations Security Council Resolu-
19
tion 2250 on Youth, Peace, and Security, which was 
20
adopted on December 9, 2015, formalized an inter-
21
national framework to address the role of youth in 
22
building and sustaining peace and preventing con-
23
flict.
