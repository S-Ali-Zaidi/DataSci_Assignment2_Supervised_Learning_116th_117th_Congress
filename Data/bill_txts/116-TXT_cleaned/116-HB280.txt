(a) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds as follows: 
2
(1) There is currently no comprehensive system 
3
for acquiring accurate data on the incidence of 
4
sports- and recreation-related concussions across 
5
youth age groups and sports. 
6
(2) Overall, according to a report entitled 
7
‘‘Sports-Related Concussions in Youth: Improving 
8
the Science, Changing the Culture’’, issued by the 
9
National Academies in 2013, each year in the 
10
United States, there are approximately 1.6 to 3.8 
11
million sports- and recreation-related traumatic 
12
brain injuries, including concussions and other head 
13
injuries. These figures are based on conservative es-
14
timates. 
15
(3) Between 2001 and 2009, the reported num-
16
ber of our youth ages 21 and under treated in an 
17
emergency department for concussion and other non- 
18
fatal sports and recreation-related traumatic brain 
19
injuries increased from 150,000 to 250,000. 
20
(4) Over the same time period between 2001 
21
and 2009, the rate of emergency room visits for con-
22
cussive injuries increased by 57 percent.

(5) Yet, according to the National Academies 
1
there currently is— 
2
(A) a lack of data to accurately estimate 
3
the incidence of sports-related concussions 
4
across a variety of sports and for youth across 
5
the pediatric age spectrum; and 
6
(B) no comprehensive system for acquiring 
7
accurate data on the incidence of sports- and 
8
recreation-related concussions across all youth 
9
age groups and sports. 
10
(6) Currently, there are significant information 
11
gaps in the proper protocol for diagnosis and treat-
12
ment of sports-related concussions and more re-
13
search desperately is needed. 
14
(b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this Act are— 
15
(1) to increase awareness and knowledge about 
16
concussions through development of, implementation 
17
of, and evaluation of the effectiveness of, large-scale 
18
collaborative efforts and research by entities includ-
19
ing, but not limited to, national sports associations, 
20
State high school associations, trainers’ associations, 
21
appropriate Federal entities, and other stakeholders 
22
such as parents, coaches, and students; and 
23
(2) to change the culture (including social 
24
norms, attitudes, and behaviors) surrounding con-
