SEC. 101. FINDINGS. 
14
Congress finds that— 
15
(1) since the passage of the Act of July 1, 1862 
16

•HR 252 IH
the ‘‘Pacific Railway Act of 1862’’), under which 
1
railroad land grants along the Union Pacific Rail-
2
road right-of-way created a checkerboard land pat-
3
tern of alternating public land and privately owned 
4
land, management of the land in the checkerboard 
5
area has been a constant source of frustration for 
6
both private landholders and the Federal Govern-
7
ment; 
8
(2) management of Federal land in the checker-
9
board area has been costly and difficult for the Fed-
10
eral land management agencies, creating a disincen-
11
tive to manage the land effectively; 
12
(3) parcels of land within the checkerboard area 
13
in the County will not vary significantly in appraised 
14
value by acre due to the similarity of highest and 
15
best use in the County; and 
16
(4) consolidation of appropriate land within the 
17
checkerboard area through sales and as acre-for-acre 
18
exchanges for development and Federal management 
19
will— 
20
(A) help improve the tax base of the Coun-
21
ty; and 
22
(B) simplify management for the Federal 
23
Government.
