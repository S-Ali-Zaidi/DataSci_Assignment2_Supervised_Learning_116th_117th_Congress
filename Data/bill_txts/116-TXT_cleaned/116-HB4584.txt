SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Expanding the ability of low- and middle-in-
3
come borrowers to pursue higher education is critical 
4
to reversing decades of exclusionary policies that 
5
have adversely impacted people of color. 
6
(2) Under current law, individuals with drug-re-
7
lated offenses are precluded from accessing Federal 
8
grants, loans, and work-study aid pursuant to sec-
9
tion 484(r) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 
10
(20 U.S.C. 1091(r)), commonly referred to as the 
11
‘‘Aid Elimination Penalty’’. 
12
(3) The Free Application for Federal Student 
13
Aid (FAFSA) screens applicants for Federal finan-
14
cial aid based on her or his history of drug offenses. 
15
(4) Given that criminal sentencing laws in the 
16
United States disproportionately impact racial mi-
17
norities and low-income communities, the Aid Elimi-
18
nation Penalty may disproportionately hinder these 
19
same groups from accessing Federal financial aid. 
20
(5) Recognizing that an educated citizenry is 
21
the powerhouse of the Nation, that higher education 
22
allows Americans to access well-paying jobs, health-
23
care, strong interpersonal relationships and a higher 
24
quality of life, the Federal Government should incen-
