A BILL 
To direct the Secretary of State to develop a strategy to 
regain observer status for Taiwan in the World Health 
Organization, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. PARTICIPATION OF TAIWAN IN THE WORLD 
3
HEALTH ORGANIZATION. 
4
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following find-
5
ings: 
6
(1) The World Health Organization (WHO) is 
7
a specialized agency of the United Nations, charged 
8
with coordinating health efforts within the United 
9
Nations system. The World Health Assembly

(WHA) is the decision-making body of the WHO, 
1
which convenes annually in May to set the policies 
2
and priorities of the organization. Statehood is not 
3
a requirement for attendance at the WHA, and nu-
4
merous observers, including non-members and non- 
5
governmental organizations, attended the most re-
6
cent WHA in May 2018. 
7
(2) Taiwan began seeking to participate in the 
8
WHO as an observer in 1997. In 2009, with strong 
9
support from successive United States Administra-
10
tions, Congress, and like-minded WHO Member 
11
States, and during a period of improved Cross-Strait 
12
relations, Taiwan received an invitation to attend 
13
the WHA as an observer under the name ‘‘Chinese 
14
Taipei’’. Taiwan received the same invitation each 
15
year until 2016, when following the election of Presi-
16
dent Tsai-Ing Wen of the Democratic Progressive 
17
Party, Taiwan’s engagement in the international 
18
community began facing increased resistance from 
19
the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Taiwan’s in-
20
vitation to the 2016 WHA was received late and in-
21
cluded new language conditioning Taiwan’s partici-
22
pation on the PRC’s ‘‘one China principle’’. In 2017 
23
and 2018, Taiwan did not receive an invitation to 
24
the WHA.

(3) Taiwan remains a model contributor to 
1
world health, having provided financial and technical 
2
assistance to respond to numerous global health 
3
challenges. Taiwan has invested over $6 billion in 
4
international medical and humanitarian aid efforts 
5
impacting over 80 countries since 1996. In 2014, 
6
Taiwan responded to the Ebola crisis by donating $1 
7
million and providing 100,000 sets of personal pro-
8
tective equipment. Through the Global Cooperation 
9
and Training Framework, the United States and 
10
Taiwan have jointly conducted training programs for 
11
experts to combat MERS, Dengue Fever, and Zika. 
12
These diseases know no borders, and Taiwan’s need-
13
less exclusion from global health cooperation in-
14
creases the dangers presented by global pandemics. 
15
(4) Taiwan’s international engagement has 
16
faced increased resistance from the PRC. Taiwan 
17
was not invited to the 2016 Assembly of the Inter-
18
national Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), despite 
19
participating as a guest at the organization’s prior 
20
summit in 2013. Taiwan’s requests to participate in 
21
the General Assembly of the International Criminal 
22
Police Organization (INTERPOL) have also been 
23
rejected. In May 2017, PRC delegates disrupted a 
24
meeting of the Kimberley Process on conflict dia-

monds held in Perth, Australia, until delegates from 
1
Taiwan were asked to leave. Since 2016, the Demo-
2
cratic Republic of Sa˜o Tome´ and Prı´ncipe, the Re-
3
public of Panama, the Dominican Republic, Burkina 
4
Faso, and the Republic of El Salvador have termi-
5
nated longstanding diplomatic relationships with 
6
Taiwan and granted diplomatic recognition to the 
7
PRC. 
8
(5) Congress has established a policy of support 
9
for Taiwan’s participation in international bodies 
10
that address shared transnational challenges, par-
11
ticularly in the WHO. Congress passed H.R. 1794 
12
in the 106th Congress, H.R. 428 in the 107th Con-
13
gress, and S. 2092 in the 108th Congress to direct 
14
the Secretary of State to establish a strategy for, 
15
and to report annually to Congress on, efforts to ob-
16
tain observer status for Taiwan at the WHA. Con-
17
gress also passed H.R. 1151 in the 113th Congress, 
18
directing the Secretary to report on a strategy to 
19
gain observer status for Taiwan at the ICAO Assem-
20
bly, and H.R. 1853 in the 114th Congress, directing 
21
the Secretary to report on a strategy to gain ob-
22
server status for Taiwan at the INTERPOL Assem-
23
bly. However, since 2016 Taiwan has not received 
24

an invitation to attend any of these events as an ob-
