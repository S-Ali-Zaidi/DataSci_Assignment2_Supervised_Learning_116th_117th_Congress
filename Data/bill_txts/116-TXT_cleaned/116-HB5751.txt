structure in low-income communities and communities 
of color, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

Congress makes the following findings:

•HR 5751 IH
(1) The transportation sector is the largest sin-
1
gle source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United 
2
States. 
3
(2) The transportation sector is also a major 
4
source of air pollution in the United States, includ-
5
ing over 55 percent of total nitrogen oxide emissions, 
6
leading to poor air quality and negative health im-
7
pacts, particularly in urban areas. 
8
(3) Increasing the deployment of electric vehi-
9
cles and electric vehicle charging infrastructure is an 
10
essential component of combating climate change, 
11
decarbonizing the economy, and reducing greenhouse 
12
gas emissions and health-harming air pollution in 
13
the United States. 
14
(4) Industries relating to electric vehicles, elec-
15
tric vehicle charging infrastructure, and the larger 
16
clean energy economy are substantial and diverse 
17
sources of good jobs and significant contributors to 
18
economic growth. 
19
(5) A substantial increase in electric vehicle 
20
charging infrastructure within urban areas will en-
21
sure that our cities are ready to meet the demands 
22
of expected electric vehicle deployment in the short- 
23
term and long-term.

(6) Low-income communities and communities 
1
of color bear disproportionate climate change and 
2
pollution burdens, and therefore, these communities 
3
must be among the first to receive investment relat-
4
ing to new technologies and infrastructure that ad-
5
dress the climate crisis and mitigate localized envi-
6
ronmental pollution.

16
date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary 
17
