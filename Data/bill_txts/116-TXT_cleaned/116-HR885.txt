Whereas assistive technology is any item, piece of equipment, 
or product system that is used to increase, maintain, or 
improve the functional capabilities of individuals with dis-
abilities and older adults; 
Whereas the term ‘‘assistive technology service’’ means any 
service that directly assists an individual with a disability 
or an older adult in the selection, acquisition, or use of 
an assistive technology device; 
Whereas, in 2018, the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention reported that 1 in 4 individuals in the United

Whereas, in 2017, the Department of Education reported 
that there were more than 7,000,000 children with dis-
abilities; 
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention re-
ported that, among adults 65 years of age and older, 2 
in 5 have a disability; 
Whereas assistive technology allows individuals with disabil-
ities and older adults to be included in their communities 
and in inclusive classrooms and workplaces; 
Whereas assistive technology devices and services are neces-
sities, not luxury items, for millions of individuals with 
disabilities and older adults, without which they would be 
unable to live in their communities, access education, or 
obtain, retain, and advance gainful, competitive, inte-
grated employment; 
Whereas the availability of assistive technology in the work-
place promotes economic self-sufficiency, enhances work 
participation, and is critical to the employment of individ-
uals with disabilities and older adults; and 
Whereas State assistive technology programs support a con-
tinuum of services that include— 
(1) the exchange, repair, recycling, and other reutili-
zation of assistive technology devices; 
(2) device loan programs that provide short-term 
loans of assistive technology devices to individuals, em-
ployers, public agencies, and others; 
(3) the demonstration of devices to inform decision-
making; and 
(4) State financing to help individuals purchase or 
obtain assistive technology through a variety of initia-
tives, such as financial loan programs, leasing programs,
