SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds as follows: 
2
(1) Neil A. Armstrong, through his own defini-
3
tion, was first and foremost a test pilot. 
4
(2) A native of Wapakoneta, Ohio, Armstrong 
5
began his inspiring career in space exploration in 
6
Cleveland, Ohio, at what is now the NASA John H. 
7
Glenn Research Center. 
8
(3) Becoming the first human to land a space-
9
craft, and then set foot upon the moon, represents 
10
the greatest dream of any test pilot. 
11
(4) Therefore, it is fitting that the premier aer-
12
onautics and space test station in Ohio should be re-
13
named in his honor.
