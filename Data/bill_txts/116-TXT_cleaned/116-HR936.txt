RESOLUTION 
Supporting the designation of April 19–25, 2020, as National 
Crime Victims’ Rights Week. 
Whereas crime and victimization in the United States have 
significant, often devastating impacts on victims, sur-
vivors, and communities large and small; 
Whereas, in 2018, there were 3.3 million violent victimiza-
tions, yet only 43 percent of these crimes were reported 
to police, and only 11 percent of violent victim crime vic-
tims accessed assistance from a victim service agency; 
Whereas crime victims and survivors need and deserve sup-
port and access to services to help them cope with the 
physical, psychological, financial, social, and spiritual im-
pact of crime;
