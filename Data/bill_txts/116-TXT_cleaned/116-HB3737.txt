Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress makes the following findings:

•HR 3737 IH
(1) Each year, many people in the United 
1
States are injured by defective products manufac-
2
tured or produced by foreign entities and imported 
3
into the United States. 
4
(2) Both consumers and businesses in the 
5
United States have been harmed by injuries to peo-
6
ple in the United States caused by defective prod-
7
ucts manufactured or produced by foreign entities. 
8
(3) People in the United States injured by de-
9
fective products manufactured or produced by for-
10
eign entities often have difficulty recovering damages 
11
from the foreign manufacturers and producers re-
12
sponsible for such injuries. 
13
(4) The difficulty described in paragraph (3) is 
14
caused by the obstacles in bringing a foreign manu-
15
facturer or producer into a United States court and 
16
subsequently enforcing a judgment against that 
17
manufacturer or producer. 
18
(5) Obstacles to holding a responsible foreign 
19
manufacturer or producer liable for an injury to a 
20
person in the United States undermine the purpose 
21
of the tort laws of the United States. 
22
(6) The difficulty of applying the tort laws of 
23
the United States to foreign manufacturers and pro-
24
ducers puts United States manufacturers and pro-
25
02:04 Jul 23, 2019
H3737

•HR 3737 IH
ducers at a competitive disadvantage because United 
1
States manufacturers and producers must— 
2
(A) abide by common law and statutory 
3
safety standards; and 
4
(B) invest substantial resources to ensure 
5
that they do so. 
6
(7) Foreign manufacturers and producers can 
7
avoid the expenses necessary to make their products 
8
safe if they know that they will not be held liable for 
9
violations of United States product safety laws. 
10
(8) Businesses in the United States undertake 
11
numerous commercial relationships with foreign 
12
manufacturers, exposing the businesses to additional 
13
tort liability when foreign manufacturers or pro-
14
ducers evade United States courts. 
15
(9) Businesses in the United States engaged in 
16
commercial relationships with foreign manufacturers 
17
or producers often cannot vindicate their contractual 
18
rights if such manufacturers or producers seek to 
19
avoid responsibility in United States courts. 
20
(10) One of the major obstacles facing busi-
21
nesses and individuals in the United States who are 
22
injured and who seek compensation for economic or 
23
personal injuries caused by foreign manufacturers 
24
02:04 Jul 23, 2019
H3737
4 
•HR 3737 IH
and producers is the challenge of serving process on 
1
such manufacturers and producers. 
2
(11) An individual or business injured in the 
3
United States by a foreign company must rely on a 
4
foreign government to serve process when that com-
5
pany is located in a country that is a signatory to 
6
the Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial 
7
and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial 
8
Matters done at The Hague November 15, 1965 (20 
9
UST 361; TIAS 6638). 
10
(12) An injured person in the United States 
11
must rely on the cumbersome system of letters roga-
12
tory to effect service in a country that did not sign 
13
the Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial 
14
and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial 
15
Matters. These countries do not have an enforceable 
16
obligation to serve process as requested. 
17
(13) The procedures described in paragraphs 
18
(11) and (12) add time and expense to litigation in 
19
the United States, thereby discouraging or frus-
20
trating meritorious lawsuits brought by persons in-
21
jured in the United States against foreign manufac-
22
turers and producers. 
23
(14) Foreign manufacturers and producers 
24
often seek to avoid judicial consideration of their ac-
25
02:04 Jul 23, 2019
H3737
5 
•HR 3737 IH
tions by asserting that United States courts lack 
1
personal jurisdiction over them. 
2
(15) The due process clauses of the fifth 
3
amendment to and section 1 of the fourteenth 
4
amendment to the Constitution govern United States 
5
courts’ personal jurisdiction over defendants. 
6
(16) The due process clauses described in para-
7
graph (15) are satisfied when a defendant consents 
8
to the jurisdiction of a court. 
9
(17) United States markets present many op-
10
portunities for foreign manufacturers. 
11
(18) In choosing to export products to the 
12
United States, a foreign manufacturer or producer 
13
subjects itself to the laws of the United States. Such 
14
a foreign manufacturer or producer thereby acknowl-
15
edges that it is subject to the personal jurisdiction 
16
of the State and Federal courts in at least one 
17
State. 
18
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
19
It is the sense of Congress that— 
20
(1) foreign manufacturers and producers whose 
21
products are sold in the United States should not be 
22
able to avoid liability simply because of difficulties 
23
relating to serving process upon them; 
24
02:04 Jul 23, 2019
H3737
6 
•HR 3737 IH
(2) to avoid such lack of accountability, foreign 
1
manufacturers and producers of foreign products 
2
distributed in the United States should be required, 
3
by regulation, to register an agent in the United 
4
States who is authorized to accept service of process 
5
for such manufacturer or producer; 
6
(3) it is unfair to United States consumers and 
7
businesses that foreign manufacturers and producers 
8
often seek to avoid judicial consideration of their ac-
9
tions by asserting that United States courts lack 
10
personal jurisdiction over them; 
11
(4) those who benefit from exporting products 
12
to United States markets should expect to be subject 
13
to the jurisdiction of at least one court within the 
14
United States; 
15
(5) exporting products to the United States 
16
should be understood as consent to the account-
17
ability that the legal system of the United States en-
18
sures for all manufacturers and producers, foreign, 
19
and domestic; 
20
(6) exporters recognize the scope of opportuni-
21
ties presented to them by United States markets but 
22
also should recognize that products imported into 
23
the United States must satisfy Federal and State 
24
02:04 Jul 23, 2019

7 
•HR 3737 IH
safety standards established by statute, regulation, 
1
and common law; 
2
(7) foreign manufacturers should recognize that 
3
they are responsible for the contracts they enter into 
4
with United States companies; 
5
(8) foreign manufacturers should act respon-
6
sibly and recognize that they operate within the con-
7
straints of the United States legal system when they 
8
export products to the United States; 
9
(9) United States laws and the laws of United 
10
States trading partners should not put burdens on 
11
foreign manufacturers and producers that do not 
12
apply to domestic companies; 
13
(10) it is fair to ensure that foreign manufac-
14
turers, whose products are distributed in commerce 
15
in the United States, are subject to the jurisdiction 
16
of State and Federal courts in at least one State be-
17
cause all United States manufacturers are subject to 
18
the jurisdiction of the State and Federal courts in 
19
at least one State; and 
20
(11) it should be understood that, by reg-
21
istering an agent for service of process in the United 
22
States, the foreign manufacturer or producer ac-
23
knowledges consent to the jurisdiction of the State 
24
in which the registered agent is located.
