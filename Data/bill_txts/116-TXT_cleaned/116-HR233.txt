RESOLUTION 
Condemning the Government of the Philippines for its con-
tinued detention of Senator Leila De Lima, calling for 
her immediate release, and for other purposes. 
Whereas extrajudicial killings perpetrated by the Government 
of the Philippines as part of a Government-directed anti-
drug campaign present the foremost human rights chal-
lenge in the Philippines; 
Whereas the Department of State’s 2017 Human Rights Re-
port notes numerous human rights concerns, including 
the persecution of human rights defenders and the deten-
tion of political prisoners in the Philippines, stating, 
‘‘The most significant human rights issues included: 
killings by security forces, vigilantes and others allegedly 
connected to the government, and by insurgents; torture

and abuse of prisoners and detainees by security forces; 
often harsh and life threatening prison conditions; 
warrantless arrests by security forces and cases of appar-
ent government disregard for legal rights and due proc-
ess; political prisoners; killings of and threats against 
journalists; official corruption and abuse of power; 
threats of violence against human rights activists; vio-
lence against women; and forced labor.’’; 
Whereas, on February 23, 2017, an arrest warrant was 
issued for Philippine Senator Leila De Lima for allega-
tions related to drug trafficking, and as of February 28, 
2019, Senator De Lima had been detained for 734 days. 
Whereas the charges brought against Senator De Lima fol-
lowed a history of criticizing extrajudicial killings in the 
Philippines and the Rodrigo R. Duterte administration’s 
antidrug campaign, including— 
(1) in 2009, in her capacity as Chair of the Commis-
sion on Human Rights, Senator De Lima investigated 
the alleged involvement of then-Mayor of Davao City 
Rodrigo R. Duterte in the extrajudicial killings executed 
by the so-called ‘‘Davao Death Squad’’; 
(2) on December 15, 2014, then-Secretary of Justice 
De Lima led a raid of the national penitentiary which re-
sulted in the confiscation of drugs, firearms, and contra-
band items and the extraction of 19 drug lords and high- 
profile inmates involved in the facility’s drug network; 
(3) on July 13, 2016, Senator De Lima, in her ca-
pacity as Chair of the Senate Committee on Justice and 
Human Rights, filed Senate Resolution No. 9 calling for 
an investigation into extrajudicial killings and summary 
executions of suspected drug offenders arising from 
President Duterte’s ‘‘War on Drugs’’;

(4) on August 22, 2016, Senator De Lima con-
ducted Senate hearings during which alleged former 
death squad members detailed extrajudicial killings exe-
cuted as part of the antidrug campaign and one member 
testified that Duterte participated in extrajudicial killings 
as mayor of Davao City; and 
(5) on August 2, 2016, and September 19, 2016, 
Senator De Lima delivered two privileged speeches on the 
Senate floor calling on President Duterte to end the 
killings; 
Whereas President Duterte vowed to publicly destroy Senator 
De Lima; 
Whereas the charges against Senator De Lima were sup-
ported by testimony from inmates whose illegal activities 
were disrupted by her 2014 raid; 
Whereas the United Nations Human Rights Council’s Work-
ing Group on Arbitrary Detention adopted an Opinion on 
August 24, 2018, finding several categories of arbitrary 
detention and concluding that, ‘‘Ms. De Lima’s political 
views and convictions are clearly at the centre of the 
present case and that the authorities have displayed an 
attitude towards her that can only be characterized as 
targeted and discriminatory. Indeed, she has been the 
target of partisan persecution and there is no explanation 
for this other than her exercise of the right to express 
such views and convictions as a human rights defender.’’; 
Whereas the Department of State’s 2017 Human Rights Re-
port highlighted due process obstructions in the case of 
Senator De Lima, stating, ‘‘During the year prosecutors 
used a variety of legal tactics, including filing new and 
amending previous charges, to delay arraignment.’’;

•HRES 233 IH 
Whereas the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary 
Detention recommended that the Government of the Phil-
ippines adopt certain measures, including— 
(1) the immediate release of Senator De Lima; 
(2) an independent investigation of the circumstan-
ces surrounding the arbitrary detention; and 
(3) the provision of compensation and other repara-
tions, including reinstatement to the positions from which 
she was ousted; 
Whereas, on July 20, 2017, the Tom Lantos Human Rights 
Commission of the United States Congress held a hearing 
on The Human Rights Consequences of the War on 
Drugs in the Philippines, during which Human Rights 
Watch testified about the ‘‘relentless government cam-
paign’’ against Senator De Lima ‘‘in evident response to 
her outspoken criticism of Duterte’s ‘war on drugs’ and 
her calls for accountability’’; 
Whereas Amnesty International finds Senator De Lima’s de-
tention to be based solely on her criticism of the Govern-
ment, her political beliefs, and her peaceful defense of 
human rights, and considers her a Prisoner of Con-
science; and 
Whereas nongovernmental organizations, human rights 
groups, parliamentary bodies, and individuals have called 
for Senator De Lima’s immediate release, including the 
European Parliament, the Australian Parliament, the 
Inter-Parliamentary 
Union, 
Amnesty 
International, 
Human Rights Watch, Liberal International, ASEAN 
Parliamentarians for Human Rights, and many of Sen-
ator De Lima’s colleagues in the Senate minority bloc: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—

freedom of expression;

(3) calls on the Government of the Philippines 
15
to immediately release Senator De Lima, drop all

charges against her, remove restrictions on her per-

sonal and work conditions, and allow her to fully dis-
18

the Committee on Social Justice; and

21
nize the importance of human rights defenders and

their work, and allow them to operate freely without
