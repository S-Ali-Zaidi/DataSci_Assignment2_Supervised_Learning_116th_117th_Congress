CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the necessity of preserving official and unofficial 
records of meetings between the President of the United 
States and foreign leaders, for the purposes of promoting 
transparency and the national security of the United 
States of America. 
Whereas chapter 22 of title 44, United States Code (com-
monly known as the Presidential Records Act of 1978), 
states that the records of the President and the Presi-
dent’s staff belong to the American people, not the Presi-

Whereas the Presidential Records Act of 1978 requires the

dent, the President’s staff, or units or individuals in the 
Executive Office of the President; 
Whereas the Act defines the term ‘‘documentary material’’ as 
‘‘all books, correspondence, memoranda, documents, pa-
pers, pamphlets, works of art, models, pictures, photo-
graphs, plats, maps, films, and motion pictures, includ-
ing, but not limited to, audio and visual records, or other 
electronic or mechanical recordations, whether in analog, 
digital, or any other form’’; 
Whereas the Act was passed in response to President Nixon’s 
claim that he owned the tape recordings in his office, an 
assertion rejected by the Supreme Court; the Act con-
sequently states that all files of the President must be 
preserved; 
Whereas, according to numerous reports, President Trump 
has torn up or otherwise destroyed records; 
Whereas President Trump reportedly seized the notes of an 
interpreter following a 2017 meeting with President 
Vladimir Putin of Russia; and 
Whereas, consequently, senior Administration officials and 
Congress do not have knowledge of what President 
Trump told Mr. Putin: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate 
1
concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that—
