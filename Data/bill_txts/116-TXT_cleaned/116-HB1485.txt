Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Computer Science for

All Act of 2019’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds that:

•HR 1485 IH
(1) Computer science is transforming industry, 
1
creating new fields of commerce, driving innovation, 
2
and bolstering productivity. It is projected that com-
3
puting will make up 2⁄3 of new science and engineer-
4
ing jobs. 
5
(2) However, the more than 500,000 computing 
6
jobs unfilled in the United States suggests that our 
7
students are not being prepared to meet the de-
8
mands of a 21st century economy. It is projected 
9
that there will be 1,400,000 new jobs in the tech-
10
nology sector by 2020; however, 70 percent of those 
11
jobs will be unfulfilled at the rate American univer-
12
sities are producing qualified graduates. 
13
(3) Knowledge of computer science and use of 
14
technology is increasingly essential for all individ-
15
uals, not just those working or planning to work in 
16
the technology sector. 
17
(4) Providing students with computer science 
18
education in elementary school and secondary school 
19
is critical for student success, and strengthening the 
20
workforce of a 21st century economy. 
21
(5) While an estimated 90 percent of parents 
22
want computer science taught in their children’s 
23
schools, just 25 percent of all elementary schools 
24
and secondary schools offer high-quality computer 
25

science instruction that includes programming and 
1
coding. 
2
(6) Black and Hispanic workers in the science 
3
and engineering workforce continue to be underrep-
4
resented. Black employees represent 11 percent of 
5
the U.S. workforce, but only 9 percent of the science 
6
and engineering workforce. Hispanic employees rep-
7
resent 16 percent of the U.S. workforce, but only 7 
8
percent of the science and engineering workforce. 
9
(7) While underrepresented minority students 
10
overall face an opportunity gap in STEAM edu-
11
cation, women of color particularly face an achieve-
12
ment gap in science and engineering education. In 
13
2015, while women were conferred nearly a third of 
14
all science and engineering degrees, women of color 
15
received only 13 percent (Black: 3.2 percent; His-
16
panic: 3.9 percent; Native American or Alaskan Na-
17
tive: 0.2 percent; Asian or Pacific Islander: 4.5 per-
18
cent; and multi-racial: 1.2 percent). 
19
(8) Women overall face challenges in accessing 
20
computer science education. Only 18 percent of all 
21
bachelor’s degrees conferred in computer science 
22
went to women in 2015, and women of color received 
23
only 9 percent of degrees (Black: 3 percent; His-
24
panic: 2 percent; Native American or Alaska Native:

•HR 1485 IH
0.8 percent; and Asian or Pacific islander: 3 per-
1
cent). 
2
(9) Disparities in enrollment and academic 
3
achievement start early. In 2018, only 28 percent of 
4
students taking either AP Computer Science exams 
5
were women, and just 21 percent were African 
6
American, or Latino. 
7
(10) Nationwide, only 88 Native American stu-
8
dents took the AP Computer Science exam in 2016, 
9
a decrease from 2015. This means that while Native 
10
Americans make up about 1.1 percent of the U.S. 
11
student population, they made up 1⁄5 of a percent of 
12
students who took AP Computer Science exams in 
13
2016.
