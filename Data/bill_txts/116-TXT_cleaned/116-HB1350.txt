tiveness of the Green Alert communications net-
13
work may be affected by overuse, including cri-
14
teria to determine— 
15
(i) whether the mental or physical ca-

pacity of a veteran who is missing, and the

18
warrant the issuance of a Green Alert, in-
19
cluding whether the veteran has a condi-
20
tion related to the veteran’s service in the 
21
Armed Forces that increases the risk that

another person; and

cols for procedures that are needed from the time of
