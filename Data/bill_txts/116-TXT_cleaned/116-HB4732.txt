SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
1
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) According to the Intergovernmental Panel 
3
on Climate Change, the Earth’s climate is now 
4
changing faster than at any point in history. 
5
(2) The October 2018 report entitled ‘‘Special 
6
Report on Global Warming of 1.5° C’’ by the Inter-
7
governmental Panel on Climate Change and the No-
8
vember 2018 Fourth National Climate Assessment 
9
report found that a changing climate is— 
10
(A) causing sea levels to rise; 
11
(B) contributing to an increase in wildfires 
12
and temperature extremes in some parts of the 
13
world; and 
14
(C) contributing to an increase in heavy 
15
precipitation in certain locations. 
16
(3) Forced displacement and forced migration 
17
are increasing in the context of environmental 
18
changes and climate-induced disruptions, including 
19
weather-related disasters, drought, famine, and ris-
20
ing sea levels. 
21
(4) Climate-related events and disasters are 
22
causing a person to be displaced from his or her 
23
home every second.

(5) The United Nations Human Rights Council 
1
has recognized that climate change poses an existen-
2
tial threat that has already had a negative impact on 
3
the fulfilment of human rights, specifically noting 
4
that— 
5
(A) parties should, when taking action to 
6
address climate change, respect, promote, and 
7
consider their respective obligations on human 
8
rights; and 
9
(B) the adverse effects of climate change 
10
are felt most acutely by those segments of the 
11
population that are already in vulnerable situa-
12
tions owing to factors such as geography, pov-
13
erty, gender, age, indigenous or minority status, 
14
national or social origin, birth, or other status 
15
and disability. 
16
(6) The Office of the United Nations High 
17
Commissioner for Human Rights has suggested that 
18
a person who cannot be reasonably expected to re-
19
turn to his or her country of origin— 
20
(A) should be considered a victim of forced 
21
displacement; and 
22
(B) should be granted at least a temporary 
23
stay in the country where they have found ref-
24
uge.

(7) The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
1
Change affirms with high confidence that societal 
2
adaptations in the near term can help reduce the 
3
risks of climate change throughout the 21st century. 
4
(8) Since 2013, typhoons and storms in the 
5
Philippines have displaced nearly 15,000,000 people. 
6
(9) Violence in Burma’s Rakhine State has 
7
forced nearly 1,000,000 Rohingya refugees into 
8
Bangladesh, where they are exposed to the country’s 
9
vulnerability to the effects of extreme flooding and 
10
landslides worsened by climate change. 
11
(10) In 2019, extreme flooding in Northern and 
12
Northeast India displaced at least 3,000,000 people, 
13
including almost 2,000,000 people in the Northern 
14
Indian state of Bihar and more than 1,700,000 peo-
15
ple in Northeastern Assam state. 
16
(11) The small Pacific island Nation of Kiribati 
17
is preparing for large swaths of the country to be 
18
uninhabitable and for its people to migrate with the 
19
skill to integrate into their new host nation. 
20
(12) More than 150,000,000 people around the 
21
world now live on land that will be below sea level 
22
or regular flood levels by the end of the century un-
23
less adaptation measures are taken.

(13) The effects of climate change also exacer-
1
bate social, economic, and political tensions within 
2
and among nations. 
3
(14) In 2014, the Department of Defense 
4
Quadrennial Defense Review cited the effects of cli-
5
mate change as a ‘‘threat multiplier’’ that could ag-
6
gravate stressors abroad. 
7
(15) In 2016, a memorandum from the Na-
8
tional Intelligence Counsel entitled ‘‘Implications for 
9
U.S. National Security of Anticipated Climate 
10
Change’’ highlighted how climate change could cre-
11
ate or inflame tensions between nations in already 
12
disputed regions, such as the Arctic. 
13
(16) Continued climate change will drive fur-
14
ther displacement. According to the International 
15
Organization for Migration, by 2050, there could be 
16
as many as 200,000,000 climate-displaced persons, 
17
including those who are internally displaced. 
18
(17) The United States has not systematically 
19
acted to address climate displacement or to provide 
20
appropriate durable solutions to those who are dis-
21
placed. 
22
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
23
gress that the United States should— 
24
22:09 Oct 27, 2019

•HR 4732 IH
(1) reduce its domestic greenhouse gas emis-
1
sions on a scale and rate proportionate to its histor-
2
ical responsibility and the urgency of the threat of 
3
climate change; 
4
(2) welcome the shared responsibility of climate 
5
change adaptation, global disaster risk reduction, re-
6
siliency building, and disaster response and recovery; 
7
(3) assist in providing durable solutions for cli-
8
mate-displaced persons; 
9
(4) aid other countries in their climate change 
10
mitigation efforts; and 
11
(5) work with the international community— 
12
(A) to establish a framework to share such 
13
responsibilities; and 
14
(B) to ensure that the human rights of cli-
15
mate-displaced persons are acknowledged, re-
16
spected, protected, and fulfilled.
