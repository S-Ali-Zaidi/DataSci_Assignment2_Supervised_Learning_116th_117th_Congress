RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the United States postal facility network is an asset 
of significant value and the United States Postal Service 
should take appropriate measures to maintain, modernize 
and fully utilize the existing post office network for eco-
nomic growth. 
Whereas the postal facility network is an integral part of uni-
versal service and should be modernized to make uni-
versal service relevant for the 21st century; 
Whereas the closure of post offices in rural communities 
would create an economic burden for people in the United 
States that depend on universal service for communica-
tion, package services, and non-typical postal services;

•HRES 78 IH 
Whereas the closure process of post offices does not ade-
quately take into account community input; 
Whereas post offices are recognized as secure and trust-
worthy, and could function as the location for other gov-
ernment services, community events, and emergency serv-
ices; and 
Whereas post offices have become a part of the identity of 
rural communities, and provide a significant social value: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-
1
resentatives that the United States Postal Service should 
2
take all appropriate measures to modernize and maintain 
3
a post office network.
