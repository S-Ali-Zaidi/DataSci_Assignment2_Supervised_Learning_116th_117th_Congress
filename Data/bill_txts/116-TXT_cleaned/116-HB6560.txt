SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Undertaking National 
2
Initiatives to Tackle Epidemic Act of 2020’’ or the 
3
‘‘UNITE Act of 2020’’. 
4
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
5
Congress makes the following findings: 
6
(1) The outbreak of the novel coronavirus, 
7
SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID–19 (referred to 
8
in this Act as the ‘‘coronavirus’’), has disrupted the 
9
lives of all individuals in the United States and re-
10
quired enormous sacrifice. In following the guidance 
11
of public health officials, individuals in the United 
12
States have and can continue to play a key role in 
13
defeating their common, invisible enemy. 
14
(2) The Corporation for National and Commu-
15
nity Service (referred to in this Act as ‘‘CNCS’’), 
16
through the health, disaster, and poverty services 
17
administered by the CNCS under the 3 flagship 
18
AmeriCorps 
programs 
(AmeriCorps 
VISTA, 
19
AmeriCorps NCCC, and AmeriCorps State and Na-
20
tional Volunteers), is uniquely positioned to aid 
21
frontline workers and communities most impacted by 
22
the coronavirus public health emergency if the Presi-
23
dent of the United States fully mobilizes those 3 
24
programs.

•HR 6560 IH
(3) The Federal Emergency Management Agen-
1
cy (referred to in this section as ‘‘FEMA’’), tasked 
2
with leading aspects of the whole-of-government re-
3
sponse to the coronavirus outbreak, is reportedly 
4
understaffed of those frontline workers that are es-
5
sential to responding to the public health emergency. 
6
(4) On March 15, 2020, the Peace Corps invol-
7
untarily ended the service of approximately 7,300 
8
volunteers. Many of them acquired public health 
9
skills in countries abroad, which may also be applied 
10
to further service in AmeriCorps, service in FEMA, 
11
or continuing service in the Peace Corps once oper-
12
ations of the Peace Corps are to resume. 
13
SEC. 3. SENSE OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. 
14
It is the sense of the House of Representatives that— 
15
(1) the President should fully utilize the com-
16
petencies of the Federal Government workforce to 
17
battle the outbreak of coronavirus, the worst global 
18
health emergency the United States has faced in a 
19
century, as well as make available expanded opportu-
20
nities for individuals in the United States desiring to 
21
serve their country in its time of need; 
22
(2) the President should elevate the role of 
23
CNCS within the whole-of-government response to

3
Coronavirus Task Force, take steps to actively 
4

6
a volunteer in an AmeriCorps program; and 
7
(B) prioritize AmeriCorps grants that pro-
8
vide assistance to those most impacted by the 
9
coronavirus public health emergency and recruit 
10
the maximum number of volunteers authorized 
11
by law, particularly focusing on the recently un-
12
employed; 
13
(3) the United States should expand the Cadre 
14
of On-Call Response/Recovery Employees (CORE) 
15
program, administered by the Federal Emergency 
16
Management Agency, to enlist individuals in the 
17
United States to solve public health and supply-man-

19
break, as well as related to wildfires, hurricanes, and 
20
other disasters; and

24
fied individuals in the United States who have be-
