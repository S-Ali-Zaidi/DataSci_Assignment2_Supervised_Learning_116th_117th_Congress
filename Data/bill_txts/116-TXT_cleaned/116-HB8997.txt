TITLE II—STATE FORFEITURE 
1
SEC. 201. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
2
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
3
(1) The Constitution authorizes and obligates 
4
each branch of the Federal Government to protect 
5
individual rights. 
6
(2) Congress is specifically authorized by the 
7
Fourteenth Amendment to provide remedies for 
8
States’ violations of individual rights secured by the 
9
Constitution. 
10
(3) The Constitution secures the rights of indi-
11
viduals whom the Government seeks to punish for 
12
violating its laws. 
13
(4) The Government’s use of in rem pro-
14
ceedings to forfeit property to punish legal violations 
15
without affording property owners the rights of 
16
criminal defendants plainly violates their constitu-
17
tionally secured rights. 
18
(5) The Government’s use of a legal tool at the 
19
time of the founding does not preclude its being in-
20
compatible with constitutionally secured rights. 
21
(6) The long-term failure of Congress, presi-
22
dents, and the judiciary to recognize the illegitimacy 
23
of the Government’s civil forfeiture practices does 
24
not divest them of the authority to do so. 
25
00:05 Jan 11, 2021
H8997
14 
•HR 8997 IH
(7) The Government cannot lawfully jettison 
1
the rights of the accused for the sake of convenience 
2
and profit. 
3
(8) The early use of civil forfeiture in the 
4
United States was limited to admiralty and revenue 
5
contexts, in which the existence of a legal violation 
6
and the identity of the property used to effect it 
7
were often self-evident, and the owner of the prop-
8
erty to be seized was often unobtainable. 
9
(9) Although the limitations on early civil for-
10
feiture practices do not prevent those practices from 
11
being constitutionally infirm, they do materially dis-
12
tinguish the early practices from modern civil for-
13
feiture. 
14
(10) The modern use of civil forfeiture by 
15
States is not limited to admiralty or revenue con-
16
texts, its reach extends far beyond property used to 
17
commit an offense, and it is used often to supple-
18
ment, rather than recover, the Government’s reve-
19
nues. 
20
(11) Civil forfeiture statutes and precedents in-
21
corporate certain protections for property owners 
22
that, although limited, erode the nature of the pro-
23
ceedings as truly in rem and betray the punitive 
24
character of civil forfeiture. 
25
00:05 Jan 11, 2021
H8997
15 
•HR 8997 IH
(12) The tortured status of civil forfeiture in 
1
current law, in which the fiction of the property as 
2
the defendant is sustained, yet the interests of prop-
3
erty owners are, to a limited extent, nonetheless rec-
4
ognized, is the inevitable result of grandfathering 
5
civil forfeiture into a constitutional system that oth-
6
erwise secures the rights of the accused. 
7
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
8
gress that the Constitution authorizes and obligates Con-
9
gress to prohibit the use of civil asset forfeiture by the 
10
States. 
11
SEC. 202. STATE CIVIL ASSET FORFEITURE. 
12
(a) IN GENERAL.—Property owned by a person may 
13
be forfeited to a State pursuant to a civil proceeding only 
14
after— 
15
(1) criminal conviction of such person for viola-
16
tion of State criminal law; or 
17
(2) a civil proceeding in which— 
18
(A) the State proves that the person who 
19
owns the property has committed the offense 
20
giving rise to forfeiture; and 
21
(B) the person who owns such property is 
22
entitled to all rights applicable to criminal de-
23
fendants under the Constitution, including the 
24

right to be represented by counsel and the right 
1

(b) FEDERAL CAUSE
OF ACTION.—A person ag-
3
grieved by a violation of subsection (a) may bring a civil 
4
action against the State in the appropriate Federal district

enforcement of the procedures described in subsection (a).
