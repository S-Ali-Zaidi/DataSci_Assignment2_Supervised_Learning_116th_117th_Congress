RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
individual choice in health insurance should be protected. 
Whereas more than 159 million Americans under the age of 
65 are enrolled in private health insurance through their 
employer; 
Whereas more than 14 million Americans under the age of 
65 are enrolled in private health insurance that they pur-
chase on their own behalf; 
Whereas more than 22 million Americans receive Medicare 
benefits through a Medicare Advantage plan offered by a 
private entity;

•HRES 750 IH 
Whereas private health insurance coverage often provides 
benefits that are more robust than benefits offered under 
a Federal or State health program and at cost that is 
lower than under a Federal or State health program; and 
Whereas H.R. 1384 from the 116th Congress and similar 
bills would make the offering of private health insurance 
unlawful, snatching away the health insurance millions of 
Americans have, like, and rely on in favor of government 
rationing of care: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-
1
resentatives that it is the duty of the Federal Government 
2
to protect and promote individual choice in health insur-
3
ance for the American people and prevent any ‘‘Medicare 
4
for All’’ proposal that would outlaw private health plans, 
5
such as job-based coverage and Medicare Advantage plans.
