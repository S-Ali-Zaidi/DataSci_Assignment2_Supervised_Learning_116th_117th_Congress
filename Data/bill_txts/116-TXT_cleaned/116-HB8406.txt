15
for any person to sell or offer for sale a good or service 
16
at a price that— 
17

(2) indicates the seller is using the cir-
19
cumstances related to such public health emergency 
20
to increase prices unreasonably.

22
whether a person has violated subsection (a), there shall

1403 
•HR 8406 IH
such person sold or offered for sale the good or service,

factors that include the following:

3
erage price at which the same or a similar good or 
4
service was sold or offered for sale by such person— 
5
(A) during the 90-day period immediately 
6
preceding January 31, 2020; or

8
fore or after the date that is one year before 
9
the date such good or service is sold or offered 
10
for sale under subsection (a).

12
erage price at which the same or a similar good or 
13
service was readily obtainable from other similarly 
14
situated competing sellers before January 31, 2020. 
15
(3) Whether such price reasonably reflects addi-
16
tional costs, not within the control of such person, 
17
that were paid, incurred, or reasonably anticipated 
18
by such person, or reasonably reflects the profit-
19
ability of forgone sales or additional risks taken by 
20
such person, to produce, distribute, obtain, or sell

such good or service under the circumstances.

TITLE 
VI—COVID–19 
COMPAS-
1
SION AND MARTHA WRIGHT 
2
PRISON PHONE JUSTICE 
3
SEC. 601. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) Prison, jails, and other confinement facili-
6
ties in the United States have unique telecommuni-
7
cations needs due to safety and security concerns. 
8
(2) Unjust and unreasonable charges for tele-
9
phone and advanced communications services in con-
10
finement facilities negatively impact the safety and 
11
security of communities in the United States by 
12
damaging relationships between incarcerated persons 
13
and their support systems, thereby exacerbating re-
14
cidivism. 
15
(3) The COVID–19 pandemic has greatly inten-
16
sified these concerns. Jails and prisons have become 
17
epicenters for the spread of the virus, with incarcer-
18
ated persons concentrated in small, confined spaces 
19
and often without access to adequate health care. At 
20
Cook County jail alone, hundreds of incarcerated 
21
persons and jail staff have tested positive for the 
22
virus since its outbreak. 
23
(4) To prevent the spread of the virus, many 
24
jails and prisons across the country suspended pub-
25
03:13 Sep 30, 2020
H8406
1439 
•HR 8406 IH
lic visitation, leaving confinement facility commu-
1
nications services as the only way that incarcerated 
2
persons can stay in touch with their families. 
3
(5) All people in the United States, including 
4
anyone who pays for confinement facility commu-
5
nications services, should have access to communica-
6
tions services at charges that are just and reason-
7
able. 
8
(6) Unemployment has risen sharply as a result 
9
of the COVID–19 pandemic, straining the incomes 
10
of millions of Americans and making it even more 
11
difficult for families of incarcerated persons to pay 
12
the high costs of confinement facility communica-
13
tions services. 
14
(7) Certain markets for confinement facility 
15
communications services are distorted due to reverse 
16
competition, in which the financial interests of the 
17
entity making the buying decision (the confinement 
18
facility) are aligned with the seller (the provider of 
19
confinement facility communications services) and 
20
not the consumer (the incarcerated person or a 
21
member of his or her family). This reverse competi-
22
tion occurs because site commission payments to the 
23
confinement facility from the provider of confine-
24
ment facility communications services are the chief 
25
03:13 Sep 30, 2020
H8406
1440 
•HR 8406 IH
criterion many facilities use to select their provider 
1
of confinement facility communications services. 
2
(8) Charges for confinement facility commu-
3
nications services that have been shown to be unjust 
4
and unreasonable are often a result of site commis-
5
sion payments that far exceed the costs incurred by 
6
the confinement facility in accommodating these 
7
services. 
8
(9) Unjust and unreasonable charges have been 
9
assessed for both audio and video services and for 
10
both intrastate and interstate communications from 
11
confinement facilities. 
12
(10) Though Congress enacted emergency legis-
13
lation to allow free communications in Federal pris-
14
ons during the pandemic, it does not cover commu-
15
nications to or from anyone incarcerated in State 
16
and local prisons or jails. 
17
(11) Mrs. Martha Wright-Reed led a campaign 
18
for just communications rates for incarcerated peo-
19
ple for over a decade. 
20
(12) Mrs. Wright-Reed was the lead plaintiff in 
21
Wright v. Corrections Corporation of America, CA 
22
No. 00–293 (GK) (D.D.C. 2001). 
23
03:13 Sep 30, 2020
H8406
1441 
•HR 8406 IH
(13) That case ultimately led to the Wright Pe-
1
tition at the Federal Communications Commission, 
2
CC Docket No. 96–128 (November 3, 2003). 
3
(14) As a grandmother, Mrs. Wright-Reed was 
4
forced to choose between purchasing medication and 
5
communicating with her incarcerated grandson. 
6
(15) Mrs. Wright-Reed passed away on Janu-
7
ary 18, 2015, before fully realizing her dream of just 
8
communications rates for all people.

the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported 
11
that minority- and women-owned businesses were 
12
not only more likely to show signs of limited finan-
13
cial health, but also twice as likely to be classified 
14
as ‘‘at risk’’ or ‘‘distressed’’ than their non-minority 
15
counterparts.

17
pandemic, community development financial institu-
18
tions (CDFIs) and minority depository institutions 
19
(MDIs) have delivered needed capital and relief to 
20
underserved communities, many of which have borne 
21
a disproportionate impact of the COVID–19 pan-
22
demic. Through August 8, 2020, CDFIs and MDIs 
23
have provided more than $16.4 billion in Paycheck

(5) In addition to establishing relief funds and 
4
services for local businesses and individuals experi-
5
encing loss of income, CDFIs and MDIs have pro-
6
vided mortgage forbearances, loan deferments, and 
7
modifications to help address the needs of their bor-
8

9
communities and minority-owned businesses at a 
10

(6) The Community Development Financial In-

13
U.S. Department of the Treasury and was estab-
14
lished by the Riegle Community Development and 
15
Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994. The mission 
16
of the CDFI Fund is ‘‘to expand economic oppor-
17

18

19
network of community development lenders, inves-
20

SEC. 202. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) In December 2009, President Obama re-
3
leased the National Strategy for Countering Biologi-
4
cal Threats, which listed as one of seven objectives 
5
‘‘Promote global health security: Increase the avail-
6
ability of and access to knowledge and products of 
7
the life sciences that can help reduce the impact 
8
from outbreaks of infectious disease whether of nat-
9
ural, accidental, or deliberate origin’’. 
10
(2) In February 2014, the United States and 
11
nearly 30 other nations launched the Global Health 
12
Security Agenda (GHSA) to address several high- 
13
priority, global infectious disease threats. The 
14
GHSA is a multi-faceted, multi-country initiative in-
15
tended to accelerate partner countries’ measurable 
16
capabilities to achieve specific targets to prevent, de-
17
tect, and respond to infectious disease threats, 
18
whether naturally occurring, deliberate, or acci-
19
dental. 
20
(3) In 2015, the United Nations adopted the 
21
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which in-
22
clude specific reference to the importance of global 
23
health security as part of SDG 3 ‘‘ensure healthy 
24
lives and promote well-being for all at all ages’’ as 
25
follows: ‘‘strengthen the capacity of all countries, in

particular developing countries, for early warning, 
1
risk reduction and management of national and 
2
global health risks’’.

(4) On November 4, 2016, President Obama 
4
signed Executive Order 13747, ‘‘Advancing the 
5
Global Health Security Agenda to Achieve a World 
6
Safe and Secure from Infectious Disease Threats’’. 
7
(5) In October 2017 at the GHSA Ministerial 
8
Meeting in Uganda, the United States and more 
9
than 40 GHSA member countries supported the 
10
‘‘Kampala Declaration’’ to extend the GHSA for an 
11
additional 5 years to 2024. 
12
(6) In December 2017, President Trump re-
13
leased the National Security Strategy, which in-
14
cludes the priority action: ‘‘Detect and contain bio-
15
threats at their source: We will work with other 
16
countries to detect and mitigate outbreaks early to 
17
prevent the spread of disease. We will encourage 
18
other countries to invest in basic health care systems 
19
and to strengthen global health security across the 
20
intersection of human and animal health to prevent 
21
infectious disease outbreaks’’. 
22
(7) In September 2018, President Trump re-
23
leased the National Biodefense Strategy, which in-

TITLE III—SECURING AMERICA 
10
FROM EPIDEMICS ACT 
11
SEC. 301. FINDINGS. 
12
Congress finds the following: 
13
(1) Due to increasing population and popu-
14
lation density, human mobility, and ecological 
15
change, emerging infectious diseases pose a real and 
16
growing threat to global health security. 
17
(2) While vaccines can be the most effective 
18
tools to protect against infectious disease, the ab-
19
sence of vaccines for a new or emerging infectious 
20
disease with epidemic potential is a major health se-
21
curity threat globally, posing catastrophic potential 
22
human and economic costs. 
23
(3) The 1918 influenza pandemic infected 
24
500,000,000 people, or about one-third of the 
25
03:13 Sep 30, 2020
H8406
2018 
•HR 8406 IH
world’s 
population 
at 
the 
time, 
and 
killed 
1
50,000,000 people—more than died in the First 
2
World War. 
3
(4) The economic cost of an outbreak can be 
4
devastating. The estimated global cost today, should 
5
an outbreak of the scale of the 1918 influenza pan-
6
demic strike, is 5 percent of global gross domestic 
7
product. 
8
(5) Even regional outbreaks can have enormous 
9
human costs and substantially disrupt the global 
10
economy and cripple regional economies. The 2014 
11
Ebola outbreak in West Africa killed more than 
12
11,000 and cost $2,800,000,000 in losses in the af-
13
fected countries alone. 
14
(6) The ongoing novel coronavirus outbreak re-
15
flects the pressing need for quick and effective vac-
16
cine and countermeasure development. 
17
(7) While the need for vaccines to address 
18
emerging epidemic threats is acute, markets to drive 
19
the necessary development of vaccines to address 
20
them—a complex and expensive undertaking—are 
21
very often critically absent. Also absent are mecha-
22
nisms to ensure access to those vaccines by those 
23
who need them when they need them. 
24

H8406
2019 
•HR 8406 IH
(8) To address this global vulnerability and the 
1
deficit of political commitment, institutional capac-
2
ity, and funding, in 2017, several countries and pri-
3
vate partners launched the Coalition for Epidemic 
4
Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). CEPI’s mission 
5
is to stimulate, finance, and coordinate development 
6
of vaccines for high-priority, epidemic-potential 
7
threats in cases where traditional markets do not 
8
exist or cannot create sufficient demand. 
9
(9) Through funding of partnerships, CEPI 
10
seeks to bring priority vaccines candidates through 
11
the end of phase II clinical trials, as well as support 
12
vaccine platforms that can be rapidly deployed 
13
against emerging pathogens. 
14
(10) CEPI has funded multiple partners to de-
15
velop 
vaccine 
candidates 
against 
the 
novel 
16
coronavirus, responding to this urgent, global re-
17
quirement. 
18
(11) Support for and participation in CEPI is 
19
an important part of the United States own health 
20
security and biodefense and is in the national inter-
21
est, complementing the work of many Federal agen-
22
cies and providing significant value through global 
23

This title may be cited as the ‘‘Pandemic Justice Re-

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
9
(1) As of the date of introduction of this Act, 
10
the novel coronavirus has spread to all 50 States, 
11
the District of Columbia, and at least 4 territories. 
12
(2) As of September 27, 2020, more than 
13
7,119,400 people in the United States had been in-
14
fected with the coronavirus and at least 204,400 had 
15
died. 
16
(3) Although the United States has less than 5 
17
percent of the world’s population, the United States 
18
holds approximately 21 percent of the world’s pris-
19
oners and leads the world in the number of individ-
20
uals incarcerated, with nearly 2,200,000 people in-
21
carcerated in State and Federal prisons and local 
22
jails. 
23
(4) Studies have shown that individuals age out 
24
of crime starting around 25 years of age, and re-
25

H8406
2063 
•HR 8406 IH
leased individuals over the age of 50 have a very low 
1
recidivism rate. 
2
(5) According to public health experts, incarcer-
3
ated individuals are particularly vulnerable to being 
4
gravely impacted by the novel corona virus pandemic 
5
because— 
6
(A) they have higher rates of underlying 
7
health issues than members of the general pub-
8
lic, including higher rates of respiratory disease, 
9
heart disease, diabetes, obesity, HIV/AIDS, 
10
substance abuse, hepatitis, and other conditions 
11
that suppress immune response; and 
12
(B) the close conditions and lack of access 
13
to hygiene products in prisons make these insti-
14
tutions 
unusually 
susceptible 
to 
viral 
15
pandemics. 
16
(6) The spread of communicable disease in the 
17
United States generally constitutes a serious, height-
18
ened threat to the safety of incarcerated individuals, 
19
and there is a serious threat to the general public 
20
that prisons may become incubators of community 
21
spread of communicable viral disease.

SEC. 402. FINDINGS. 
7
Congress finds the following: 
8
(1) The incidence of violence known as hate 
9
crimes or crimes motivated by bias poses a serious 
10
national problem. 
11
(2) According to data obtained by the Federal 
12
Bureau of Investigation, the incidence of such vio-
13
lence increased in 2017, the most recent year for 
14
which data is available. 
15
(3) In 1990, Congress enacted the Hate Crime 
16
Statistics Act (Public Law 101–275; 28 U.S.C. 534 
17
note) to provide the Federal Government, law en-
18
forcement agencies, and the public with data regard-
19
ing the incidence of hate crime. The Hate Crimes 
20
Statistics Act and the Matthew Shepard and James 
21
Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act (division E of 
22
Public Law 111–84; 123 Stat. 2835) have enabled 
23
Federal authorities to understand and, where appro-
24
priate, investigate and prosecute hate crimes. 
25
03:13 Sep 30, 2020
H8406
2109 
•HR 8406 IH
(4) A more complete understanding of the na-
1
tional problem posed by hate crime is in the public 
2
interest and supports the Federal interest in eradi-
3
cating bias-motivated violence referenced in section 
4
249(b)(1)(C) of title 18, United States Code. 
5
(5) However, a complete understanding of the 
6
national problem posed by hate crimes is hindered 
7
by incomplete data from Federal, State, and local 
8
jurisdictions through the Uniform Crime Reports 
9
program authorized under section 534 of title 28, 
10
United States Code, and administered by the Fed-
11
eral Bureau of Investigation. 
12
(6) Multiple factors contribute to the provision 
13
of inaccurate and incomplete data regarding the in-
14
cidence of hate crime through the Uniform Crime 
15
Reports program. A significant contributing factor is 
16
the quality and quantity of training that State and 
17
local law enforcement agencies receive on the identi-
18
fication and reporting of suspected bias-motivated 
19
crimes. 
20
(7) The problem of crimes motivated by bias is 
21
sufficiently serious, widespread, and interstate in na-
22
ture as to warrant Federal financial assistance to 
23
States and local jurisdictions.
