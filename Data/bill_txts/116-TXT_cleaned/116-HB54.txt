To designate the outstation of the Department of Veterans

lor Vet Center Outstation. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. FINDINGS. 
3
Congress finds the following: 
4
(1) Major Brent Taylor began his military serv-
5
ice following the attacks of September 11, 2001. He 
6
joined the Army National Guard in 2003, three days 
7
after his engagement to his wife, Jennie. Five of his 
8
brothers would eventually serve in the Armed Forces 
9
following the deadly attacks.

(2) During his time in the Army National 
1
Guard, Major Taylor distinguished himself in service 
2
to the United States and the State of Utah. He re-
3
ceived a commission as a second lieutenant from the 
4
Brigham Young University Reserve Officer Training 
5
Corps in 2006, while graduating as a member of the 
6
National Society of Collegiate Scholars. 
7
(3) During his impressive career with the Utah 
8
National Guard, Major Taylor distinguished himself 
9
in multiple specialties, including Intelligence and 
10
Military Police. One of his earliest assignments in-
11
cluded analyzing foreign language documents in sup-
12
port of the Defense Intelligence Agency. He also led 
13
document exploitation efforts in multiple European 
14
and South American languages for a variety of intel-
15
ligence community customers. Major Taylor also 
16
managed a team that assessed security vulnerabili-
17
ties at high-profile facilities across the United 
18
States, all while maintaining a successful private 
19
sector career in Utah. 
20
(4) Major Taylor was continuously ready to 
21
take up his Nation’s call to arms and deployed four 
22
times in support of operations in Iraq and Afghani-
23
stan. His deployed duties varied from Platoon Lead-
24
er and Combat Advisor to Chief of Staff to the Spe-

cial Operations Advisory Group, responsible for lead-
1
ing a joint task force advising and assisting an elite 
2
Afghan special operations unit. 
3
(5) Throughout his deployments, Major Taylor 
4
distinguished himself on several occasions, earning a 
5
multitude of awards including the Bronze Star. The 
6
citation credits Major Taylor’s ability to think calm-
7
ly and decisively with keeping his subordinates safe 
8
while traversing 600,000 miles of roads in Iraq, 
9
laden with improvised explosive devices (hereinafter, 
10
‘‘IED’’) and ripe for ambush. 
11
(6) During one particularly harrowing mission, 
12
Major Taylor’s vehicle was struck by an IED. While 
13
he survived the attack, the wounds he received 
14
earned him the Purple Heart. 
15
(7) Major Taylor’s amazing record of service 
16
was not limited to the battlefield. In 2010, he served 
17
as a member of the North Ogden City Council and, 
18
in 2013, Major Taylor was elected mayor. His stead-
19
fast leadership led to the city being recognized as 
20
‘‘Business Friendly’’ by the Governor of Utah, and 
21
as one of the safest, freest cities in the United 
22
States by several organizations. His initiatives in-
23
cluded improvements to public works and infrastruc-
24
ture, attracting businesses to the area, developing a

local community center, and increasing trans-
1
parency. His action led his constituents to reelect 
2
Major Taylor in 2017. 
3
(8) In 2018, Major Taylor placed himself on a 
4
leave of absence from his mayoral duties in order to 
5
deploy to Afghanistan, explaining to his constituents, 
6
‘‘Service is what leadership is all about’’. 
7
(9) While serving in Afghanistan, a dear col-
8
league, Afghani Lieutenant Kefayatullah, was killed 
9
shortly before the Afghan elections. Major Taylor 
10
wrote, ‘‘The strong turnout at that election, despite 
11
the attacks and challenges, was a success for the 
12
long-suffering people of Afghanistan, and for the 
13
cause of human freedom. I am proud of the brave 
14
Afghan and U.S. soldiers I serve with. Many Amer-
15
ican, NATO and Afghan troops have died to make 
16
moments like this election possible.’’. He also 
17
extolled the American public to embrace its civic 
18
duty, stating, ‘‘I hope everyone back home exercises 
19
their precious right to vote. And that whether the 
20
Republicans or Democrats win, that we all remem-
21
ber that we have far more as Americans that unites 
22
us than divides us.’’. 
23
(10) Tragically, on Saturday, November 3rd, 
24
2018, Major Taylor was killed in an attack in Af-
25

ghanistan. He was survived by his wife, Jennie, and 
1
his seven children, Megan, Lincoln, Alex, Jacob, 
2
Ellie, Jonathan, and Caroline. 
3
(11) The impression that Major Taylor left was 
4
indelible. An Afghan officer who had served with 
5
Major Taylor, penned a letter to his wife, stating, 
6
‘‘Your husband taught me to love my wife Hamida 
7
as an equal and treat my children as treasured gifts, 
8
to be a better father, to be a better husband, and 
9
to be a better man.’’. That officer further com-
10
mented that, ‘‘He died on our soil but he died for 
11
the success of freedom and democracy in both of our 
12
countries.’’. 
13
(12) It is only well and fitting that, as a tribute 
14
to this man’s amazing life, Congress name a facility 
15
in honor of Major Taylor’s shining example of serv-
16
ice and sacrifice.
