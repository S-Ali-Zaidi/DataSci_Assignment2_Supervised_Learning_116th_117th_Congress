To prohibit depository institutions from assessing overdraft 
and nonsufficient fund fees during the novel coronavirus 
crisis and other disasters, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Stop Overdraft Profit-
4
eering during COVID–19 Emergency Act of 2020’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. 
6
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Overdraft coverage is a form of short-term 
8
credit that depository institutions market for con-
9

sumer transaction accounts. Historically, depository 
1
institutions covered overdrafts for a fee on an ad hoc 
2
basis. 
3
(2) With the growth in specially designed soft-
4
ware programs, and in consumer use of debit cards, 
5
overdraft coverage for a fee has become more preva-
6
lent. 
7
(3) Many depository institutions market a 
8
range of overdraft options but aggressively encour-
9
age consumers to consent to the most expensive op-
10
tion, where a high flat fee is collected for each indi-
11
vidual overdraft transaction. 
12
(4) Many depository institutions— 
13
(A) collect a high flat fee, including for 
14
small dollar transactions, each time the institu-
15
tion covers an overdraft, impose multiple over-
16
draft coverage fees within a single day, and 
17
charge additional fees for each day during 
18
which the account remains overdrawn; and 
19
(B) charge unreasonable nonsufficient fees. 
20
(5) Such abusive practices in connection with 
21
overdraft coverage fees and nonsufficient fees have 
22
deprived consumers of meaningful options and 
23
placed significant financial burdens on low- and 
24
moderate-income consumers.

(6) During the public health and financial crisis 
1
caused by the novel coronavirus, consumers need re-
2
lief from such abusive practices more than ever be-
3
fore. 
4
(b) PURPOSE.—It is the purpose of this Act to pro-
5
tect consumers by eliminating abusive overdraft coverage 
6
fees, nonsufficient fund fees, and practices relating to the 
7
assessment of those fees during covered periods.
