RESOLUTION 
Calling on the President to invoke the Defense Production 
Act to respond to COVID-19. 
Whereas the Defense Production Act of 1950 originated from 
World War II authorities and confers an ‘‘array of au-
thorities to shape national defense preparedness pro-
grams’’; 
Whereas the United States currently faces severe shortages 
of medical supplies necessary to respond to the ongoing 
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, such 
as materials needed to test for COVID-19, ventilators 
and personal protective equipment;

Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) is ‘‘encouraging healthcare systems to implement 
strategies to conserve supplies’’; 
Whereas, on February 29, 2020, the New York Times re-
ported that a 2005 Federal study estimated that mechan-
ical ventilators for 740,000 critically ill people would be 
necessary in the event of a severe flu pandemic, and 
‘‘today, as the country faces the possibility of a wide-
spread outbreak of a new respiratory infection caused by 
the coronavirus, there are nowhere near that many ven-
tilators, and most are already in use’’; and 
Whereas failure to massively upscale the supplies available to 
protect Americans, test for new cases of COVID-19, and 
treat people who test positive could result in even more 
severe shortages that force health care workers to make 
harrowing choices and endanger American lives: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
