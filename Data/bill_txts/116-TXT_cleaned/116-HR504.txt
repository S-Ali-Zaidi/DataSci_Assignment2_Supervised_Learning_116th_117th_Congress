than 38,500 new HIV infections; 
Whereas President Barack Obama released the National 
HIV/AIDS Strategy on July 13, 2010, in order to 
refocus attention on the domestic HIV/AIDS epidemic;

infections, increasing access to care and improving health 
outcomes for people living with HIV and AIDS, and re-
ducing HIV-related health disparities;

Whereas about 15 percent of the people living with HIV/ 
AIDS in the United States do not know they are in-
fected; 
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s 
guidelines for HIV screening in health care settings rec-
ommend routine HIV testing for all patients between the 
ages of 13 and 64, regardless of risk factors; 
Whereas individuals are more likely to act responsibly and 
protect themselves and other persons in the community 
when they know their HIV status; 
Whereas encouraging people to be tested for HIV is a critical 
element in HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment efforts; 
Whereas individuals who are HIV-positive must learn their 
status in order to obtain counseling on managing their 
health, access appropriate medical and social services, 
begin life-prolonging treatment, and take actions to avoid 
spreading the virus to others; 
Whereas physicians, physician assistants, nurses, dentists, 
and other clinicians play a vital role in providing access 
to HIV/AIDS awareness, testing, treatment, and referral 
services, and in encouraging patients to get tested for 
HIV; 
Whereas Howard University College of Medicine has declared 
July 21, 2019, to be the twelfth annual National Clini-
cians HIV/AIDS Testing and Awareness Day in an effort 
to encourage clinicians nationwide to become actively in-
volved in HIV/AIDS awareness, testing, treatment, and 
referral services; 
Whereas a diverse group of organizations representing com-
munities affected by HIV/AIDS have partnered with 
Howard University College of Medicine to promote the

Whereas the National Clinicians HIV/AIDS Testing and 
Awareness Day will give all physicians, physician assist-
ants, nurses, dentists, and other clinicians an opportunity 
to get personally involved in the fight against HIV/AIDS 
by taking an HIV test, personally demonstrating the im-
portance as well as the ease of HIV testing; 
Whereas the National Clinicians HIV/AIDS Testing and 
Awareness Day will be a call to action to clinicians na-
tionwide to lead the way in dispelling the myths and stig-
ma associated with HIV testing and become vocal advo-
cates for patients and communities; and 
Whereas the National Clinicians HIV/AIDS Testing and 
Awareness Day will encourage clinicians to become ac-
tively involved in HIV/AIDS awareness, testing, treat-
ment, and referral services: Now, therefore, be it
