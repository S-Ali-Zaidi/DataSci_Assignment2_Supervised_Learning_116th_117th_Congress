SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Eating disorders, including the specific dis-
3
orders of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge 
4
eating disorder, avoidant/restrictive food intake dis-
5
order, and other specified feeding or eating dis-
6
orders, are severe biologically based mental illnesses 
7
caused by a complex interaction of genetic, biologi-
8
cal, social, behavioral, and psychological factors. 
9
(2) Over 30,000,000 individuals in the United 
10
States of all ages, races, sizes, sexual orientations, 
11
ethnicities, and socioeconomic statuses, are affected 
12
by eating disorders during their lifetimes. 
13
(3) Eating disorders have one of the highest 
14
mortality rates of all mental illnesses, as eating dis-
15
orders can become fatal due to heart failure, kidney 
16
failure, stroke, hypoglycemia, and gastric rupture. 
17
Additionally, longitudinal studies have found that 
18
the suicide risk for those with an eating disorder is 
19
23 times the expected risk. 
20
(4) Eating disorders can be successfully treated 
21
with interventions at the appropriate durations and 
22
levels of care, yet only one-third of persons with eat-
23
ing disorders receive any medical, psychiatric, or 
24
therapeutic care. Best practice treatment of eating 
25
disorders includes patients, their families, and a

comprehensive team of professionals such as social 
1
workers, mental health counselors, primary care 
2
practitioners, psychiatrists, psychologists, dietitians, 
3
art therapists, and other specialty providers. 
4
(5) Studies examining the prevalence of eating 
5
disorders and insulin restriction among people with 
6
diabetes show that up to 35 percent of women with 
7
diabetes restrict insulin in order to lose weight at 
8
some point in their life. 
9
(6) Research shows that disordered eating 
10
among older adults consistently find that rates of 
11
disordered eating among the elderly are similar to 
12
those of younger persons. 
13
(7) Weight loss in the elderly may signal an 
14
undiagnosed medical illness or may be the result of 
15
a known medical condition and/or its pharmacologic 
16
treatment. 
17
(8) Eating disorders in the elderly are associ-
18
ated with significant morbidity and mortality, and a 
19
wide range of health issues arise secondary to eating 
20
disorders, including cardiac, metabolic, gastric, and 
21
bone conditions; diagnosis and proper treatment of 
22
this population are essential. 
23
(9) Eating disorders in the elderly are particu-
24
larly serious because chronic disorders or diseases

may already compromise a patient’s health. Inad-
1
equate nutrition can result in memory deficits, cog-
2
nitive decline, decubitus ulcers, impaired healing of 
3
sores, wounds, or infections, and dizziness, dis-
4
orientation, and falls. 
5
(10) Studies find that individuals with chronic 
6
illnesses and/or disabilities are four times more likely 
7
to have anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa com-
8
pared to the general population.
