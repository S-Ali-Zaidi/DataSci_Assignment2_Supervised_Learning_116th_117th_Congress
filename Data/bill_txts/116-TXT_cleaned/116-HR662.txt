Urging the release of information regarding the September 
11, 2001, terrorist attacks upon the United States. 
Whereas tens of thousands of pages of documents relating to 
the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, remain clas-

a full public understanding of the events and cir-

upon the United States; 
Whereas the decision to maintain the classified status of 
many of these documents prevents the people of the 
United States from having access to information about 
the attacks, including the involvement of certain foreign 
governments; and
