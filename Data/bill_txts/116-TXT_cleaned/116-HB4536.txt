through public disclosure requirements that impose 
6
a minimal burden on rights protected under the 
7
First Amendment to the Constitution of the United 
8
States; and 
9
(2) mitigating the effectiveness of efforts by 
10
foreign entities to influence United States elections 
11
through the use of social media bots to spread mis-
12
information and propaganda.
