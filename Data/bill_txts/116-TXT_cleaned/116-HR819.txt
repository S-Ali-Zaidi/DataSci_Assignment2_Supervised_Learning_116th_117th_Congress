RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the Authorization for Use of Military Force and the 
Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq 
Resolution of 2002 do not provide legal justification for 
war with Iran.

Whereas, on June 20, 2019, Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary 
Guard Corps shot down a United States RQ–4A Global 
Hawk BAMS–D surveillance drone; 
Whereas, on September 14, 2019, Iran attacked two major 
oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, leading to the largest price 
increase in oil in 30 years; 
Whereas throughout these escalations, President Trump 
acted with immense restraint; 
Whereas in the last two months of 2019, Iranian-backed mili-
tias attacked United States troops in Iraq, eventually re-
sulting in the death of one United States contractor and 
injuring four soldiers; 
Whereas between December 31, 2019, and January 1, 2019, 
Iranian-backed groups stormed the United States Em-
bassy in Iraq, leaving embassy officials fearing for their 
safety and forcing the United States to dispatch hun-
dreds of troops to deescalate the situation; 
Whereas the Government of Iran is a leading state sponsor 
of terrorism and engages in a range of destabilizing ac-
tivities across the Middle East and throughout the world; 
Whereas Iranian General Qassem Soleimani was the lead ar-
chitect of much of Iran’s destabilizing activities; 
Whereas, on January 2, 2019, President Trump authorized 
a precision strike that killed Qassem Soleimani; 
Whereas Soleimani was plotting imminent attacks on United 
States diplomats and military personnel; and 
Whereas the United States has an inherent right to self-de-
fense against imminent armed attacks and maintains the 
right to ensure the safety of diplomatic personnel serving 
abroad: Now, therefore, be it
