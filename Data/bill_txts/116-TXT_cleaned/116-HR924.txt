Whereas individuals with diabetes face an increased likelihood 
of experiencing health complications from COVID–19; 
Whereas delays in diagnosis and treatment can be harmful,

higher rates of certain diseases, such as diabetes, high 
blood pressure, and kidney disease; 
Whereas marked differences in the social determinants of 
health can lead to poor health outcomes and declines in 
longevity;

ficult to know whether resources are being equitably dis-
tributed;

Health Month; and

Month in April 2020 include bringing attention to the

and Native Hawaiians or other Pacific Islanders, includ-
ing as a result of the novel coronavirus (COVID–19):
