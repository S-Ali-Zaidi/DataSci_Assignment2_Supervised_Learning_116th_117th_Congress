TITLE X—DEMOCRACY 
7
RESTORATION ACT 
8
SEC. 1001. SHORT TITLE. 
9
This title may be cited as the ‘‘Democracy Restora-
10
tion Act of 2019’’. 
11
SEC. 1002. FINDINGS. 
12
Congress makes the following findings: 
13
(1) The right to vote is the most basic constitu-
14
tive act of citizenship. Regaining the right to vote 
15
reintegrates individuals with criminal convictions 
16
into free society, helping to enhance public safety. 
17
(2) Article I, section 4, of the Constitution of 
18
the United States grants Congress ultimate super-
19
visory power over Federal elections, an authority 
20
which has repeatedly been upheld by the Supreme 
21
Court of the United States. 
22
(3) Basic constitutional principles of fairness 
23
and equal protection require an equal opportunity 
24
for citizens of the United States to vote in Federal 
25

•HR 1893 IH
elections. The right to vote may not be abridged or 
1
denied by the United States or by any State on ac-
2
count of race, color, gender, or previous condition of 
3
servitude. The 13th, 14th, 15th, 19th, 24th, and 
4
26th Amendments to the Constitution of the United 
5
States empower Congress to enact measures to pro-
6
tect the right to vote in Federal elections. The 8th 
7
Amendment to the Constitution of the United States 
8
provides for no excessive bail to be required, nor ex-
9
cessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punish-
10
ments inflicted. 
11
(4) There are 3 areas where discrepancies in 
12
State laws regarding criminal convictions lead to un-
13
fairness in Federal elections— 
14
(A) the lack of a uniform standard for vot-
15
ing in Federal elections leads to an unfair dis-
16
parity and unequal participation in Federal 
17
elections based solely on where a person lives; 
18
(B) laws governing the restoration of vot-
19
ing rights after a criminal conviction vary 
20
throughout the country and persons in some 
21
States can easily regain their voting rights 
22
while in other States persons effectively lose 
23
their right to vote permanently; and 
24
21:35 Mar 27, 2019
H1893
khammond on DSKBBV9HB2PROD with BILLS
159 
•HR 1893 IH
(C) State disenfranchisement laws dis-
1
proportionately impact racial and ethnic minori-
2
ties. 
3
(5) Two States do not disenfranchise individ-
4
uals with criminal convictions at all (Maine and 
5
Vermont), but 48 States and the District of Colum-
6
bia have laws that deny convicted individuals the 
7
right to vote while they are in prison. 
8
(6) In some States disenfranchisement results 
9
from varying State laws that restrict voting while in-
10
dividuals are under the supervision of the criminal 
11
justice system or after they have completed a crimi-
12
nal sentence. In 34 States, convicted individuals may 
13
not vote while they are on parole and 30 of those 
14
States disenfranchise individuals on felony probation 
15
as well. In 10 States, a conviction can result in life-
16
time disenfranchisement. 
17
(7) Several States deny the right to vote to in-
18
dividuals convicted of certain misdemeanors. 
19
(8) In 2016, an estimated 6,100,000 citizens of 
20
the United States, or about 1 in 40 adults in the 
21
United States, could not vote as a result of a felony 
22
conviction. Of the 6,100,000 citizens barred from 
23
voting, only approximately 22 percent were in pris-
24
on. By contrast, roughly 77 percent of the disenfran-
25
21:35 Mar 27, 2019

160 
•HR 1893 IH
chised reside in their communities while on proba-
1
tion or parole or after having completed their sen-
2
tences. Approximately 3,100,000 citizens who com-
3
pleted their sentences remain disenfranchised due to 
4
restrictive State laws. In six States—Alabama, Flor-
5
ida, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Vir-
6
ginia—more than 7 percent of the total population 
7
is disenfranchised. As of November 2018, the life-
8
time ban for felons was eliminated through a Florida 
9
ballot initiative. As a result, 1,400,000 people had 
10
their voting rights restored. 
11
(9) In those States that disenfranchise individ-
12
uals post-sentence, the right to vote can be regained 
13
in theory, but in practice this possibility is often 
14
granted in a non-uniform and potentially discrimina-
15
tory manner. Disenfranchised individuals must ei-
16
ther obtain a pardon or an order from the Governor 
17
or an action by the parole or pardon board, depend-
18
ing on the offense and State. Individuals convicted 
19
of a Federal offense often have additional barriers to 
20
regaining voting rights. 
21
(10) State disenfranchisement laws dispropor-
22
tionately impact racial and ethnic minorities. As of 
23
2016, more than 7 percent of the voting-age Afri-
24
can-American population, or 2,200,000 African 
25

161 
•HR 1893 IH
Americans, were disenfranchised. One out of every 
1
13 African Americans were unable to vote because 
2
of felony disenfranchisement, which is a rate more 
3
than 4 times greater than non-African Americans. 
4
7.4 percent of African Americans are disenfran-
5
chised whereas only 1.8 percent of non-African 
6
Americans were. In 2016, in 4 States—Florida (23 
7
percent), Kentucky (22 percent), Tennessee (21 per-
8
cent), and Virginia (20 percent)—more than 1 in 5 
9
African Americans were unable to vote because of 
10
prior convictions. 
11
(11) Latino citizens are also disproportionately 
12
disenfranchised based upon their disproportionate 
13
representation in the criminal justice system. If cur-
14
rent incarceration trends hold, the lifetime likelihood 
15
of incarceration for males born in 2011 is 17 per-
16
cent for Latinos, in contrast to less than 6 percent 
17
of non-Latino White men. When analyzing the data 
18
across 10 States, Latinos generally have dispropor-
19
tionately higher rates of disenfranchisement com-
20
pared to their presence in the voting age population. 
21
In 6 out of 10 States studied in 2003, Latinos con-
22
stitute more than 10 percent of the total number of 
23
persons disenfranchised by State felony laws. In 4 
24
States (California, 37 percent; New York, 34 per-

cent; Texas, 30 percent; and Arizona, 27 percent), 
1
Latinos were disenfranchised by a rate of more than 
2
25 percent. 
3
(12) Disenfranchising citizens who have been 
4
convicted of a criminal offense and who are living 
5
and working in the community serves no compelling 
6
State interest and hinders their rehabilitation and 
7
reintegration into society. 
8
(13) State disenfranchisement laws can sup-
9
press electoral participation among eligible voters by 
10
discouraging voting among family and community 
11
members of disenfranchised persons. Future elec-
12
toral participation by the children of disenfranchised 
13
parents may be impacted as well. 
14
(14) The United States is the only Western de-
15
mocracy that permits the permanent denial of voting 
16
rights for individuals with felony convictions.
