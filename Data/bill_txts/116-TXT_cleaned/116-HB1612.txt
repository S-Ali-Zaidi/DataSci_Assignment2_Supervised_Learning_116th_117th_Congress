SEC. 4001. FINDINGS RELATING TO ILLICIT MONEY UNDER-
4
MINING OUR DEMOCRACY. 
5
Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) Criminals, terrorists, and corrupt govern-
7
ment officials frequently abuse anonymously held 
8
limited liability companies (LLCs), also known as 
9
‘‘shell companies’’, to hide, move, and launder the 
10
dirty money derived from illicit activities such as 
11
trafficking, bribery, exploitation, and embezzlement. 
12
Ownership and control of the finances that run 
13
through shell companies are obscured to regulators 
14
and law enforcement because little information is re-
15
quired and collected when establishing these entities. 
16
(2) The public release of the ‘‘Panama Papers’’ 
17
in 2016 and the ‘‘Paradise Papers’’ in 2017 revealed 
18
that these shell companies often purchase and sell 
19
United States real estate. United States anti-money 
20
laundering laws do not apply to cash transactions in-
21
volving real estate effectively concealing the bene-
22
ficiaries and transactions from regulators and law 
23
enforcement. 
24
19:43 Mar 29, 2019
H1612
143 
•HR 1612 IH
(3) Congress should curb the use of anonymous 
1
shell companies for illicit purposes by requiring 
2
United States companies to disclose their beneficial 
3
owners, strengthening anti-money laundering and 
4
counter-terrorism finance laws. 
5
(4) Congress should examine the money laun-
6
dering and terrorist financing risks in the real estate 
7
market, including the role of anonymous parties, and 
8
review legislation to address any vulnerabilities iden-
9
tified in this sector. 
10
(5) Congress should examine the methods by 
11
which corruption flourishes and the means to detect 
12
and deter the financial misconduct that fuels this 
13
driver of global instability. Congress should monitor 
14
government efforts to enforce United States anti- 
15
corruption laws and regulations.

operation—such as cyber activity—with overt efforts

by Russian Government agencies, state-funded

media, third-party intermediaries, and paid social 
4
media users or ‘‘trolls’’.

(2) On November 24, 2016, The Washington

Post reported findings from 2 teams of independent 
7
researchers that concluded Russians ‘‘exploited 
8
American-made technology platforms to attack U.S.

democracy at a particularly vulnerable moment . . . 
10
as part of a broadly effective strategy of sowing dis-
11

(3) Findings from a 2017 study on the manipu-
13
lation of public opinion through social media con-
14
ducted by the Computational Propaganda Research

the Kremlin is using pro-Russian bots to manipulate

(4) On September 6, 2017, the nation’s largest 
3
social media platform disclosed that between June 
4
2015 and May 2017, Russian entities purchased 
5
$100,000 in political advertisements, publishing 
6
roughly 3,000 ads linked to fake accounts associated 
7
with the Internet Research Agency, a pro-Kremlin 
8
organization. According to the company, the ads 
9
purchased focused ‘‘on amplifying divisive social and 
10
political messages . . .’’. 
11
(5) In 2002, the Bipartisan Campaign Reform 
12
Act became law, establishing disclosure requirements 
13
for political advertisements distributed from a tele-
14
vision or radio broadcast station or provider of cable 
15
or satellite television. In 2003, the Supreme Court 
16
upheld regulations on electioneering communications 
17
established under the Act, noting that such require-
18
ments ‘‘provide the electorate with information and 
19
insure that the voters are fully informed about the 
20
person or group who is speaking.’’. 
21
(6) According to a study from Borrell Associ-
22
ates, in 2016, $1,415,000,000 was spent on online 
23
advertising, more than quadruple the amount in 
24
2012.

(7) The reach of a few large internet plat-
1
forms—larger than any broadcast, satellite, or cable 
2
provider—has greatly facilitated the scope and effec-
3
tiveness of disinformation campaigns. For instance, 
4
the largest platform has over 210,000,000 Ameri-
5
cans users—over 160,000,000 of them on a daily 
6
basis. By contrast, the largest cable television pro-
7
vider has 22,430,000 subscribers, while the largest 
8
satellite television provider has 21,000,000 sub-
9
scribers. And the most-watched television broadcast 
10
in United States history had 118,000,000 viewers. 
11
(8) The public nature of broadcast television, 
12
radio, and satellite ensures a level of publicity for 
13
any political advertisement. These communications 
14
are accessible to the press, fact-checkers, and polit-
15
ical opponents; this creates strong disincentives for 
16
a candidate to disseminate materially false, inflam-
17
matory, or contradictory messages to the public. So-
18
cial media platforms, in contrast, can target portions 
19
of the electorate with direct, ephemeral advertise-
20
ments often on the basis of private information the 
21
platform has on individuals, enabling political adver-
22
tisements that are contradictory, racially or socially 
23
inflammatory, or materially false.

(9) According to comScore, 2 companies own 8 
1
of the 10 most popular smartphone applications as 
2
of June 2017, including the most popular social 
3
media and email services—which deliver information 
4
and news to users without requiring proactivity by 
5
the user. Those same 2 companies accounted for 99 
6
percent of revenue growth from digital advertising in 
7
2016, including 77 percent of gross spending. 79 
8
percent of online Americans—representing 68 per-
9
cent of all Americans—use the single largest social 
10
network, while 66 percent of these users are most 
11
likely to get their news from that site. 
12
(10) In its 2006 rulemaking, the Federal Elec-
13
tion Commission noted that only 18 percent of all 
14
Americans cited the internet as their leading source 
15
of news about the 2004 Presidential election; by con-
16
trast, the Pew Research Center found that 65 per-
17
cent of Americans identified an internet-based 
18
source as their leading source of information for the 
19
2016 election.

(12) In testimony before the Senate Select 
3
Committee on Intelligence titled, ‘‘Disinformation: A 
4
Primer in Russian Active Measures and Influence 
5
Campaigns’’, multiple expert witnesses testified that 
6
while the disinformation tactics of foreign adver-
7
saries have not necessarily changed, social media 
8
services now provide ‘‘platform[s] practically pur-
9
pose-built for active measures[.]’’. Similarly, as Gen. 
10
Keith B. Alexander (RET.), the former Director of 
11
the National Security Agency, testified, during the 
12
Cold War ‘‘if the Soviet Union sought to manipulate 
13
information flow, it would have to do so principally 
14
through its own propaganda outlets or through ac-
15
tive measures that would generate specific news: 
16
planting of leaflets, inciting of violence, creation of 
17
other false materials and narratives. But the news 
18
itself was hard to manipulate because it would have 
19
required actual control of the organs of media, which 
20
took long-term efforts to penetrate. Today, however, 
21
because the clear majority of the information on so-
22
cial media sites is uncurated and there is a rapid 
23
proliferation of information sources and other sites 
24
that can reinforce information, there is an increasing

likelihood that the information available to average

consumers may be inaccurate (whether intentionally

or otherwise) and may be more easily manipulable

SEC. 4204. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

It is the sense of Congress that— 
10
(1) the dramatic increase in digital political ad-
11
vertisements, and the growing centrality of online 
12
platforms in the lives of Americans, requires the 
13
Congress and the Federal Election Commission to 
14
take meaningful action to ensure that laws and reg-
15
ulations provide the accountability and transparency 
16
that is fundamental to our democracy; 
17
(2) free and fair elections require both trans-
18
parency and accountability which give the public a 
19
right to know the true sources of funding for polit-
20
ical advertisements in order to make informed polit-
21
