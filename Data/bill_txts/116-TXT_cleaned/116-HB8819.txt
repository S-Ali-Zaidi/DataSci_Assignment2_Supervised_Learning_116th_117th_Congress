SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) In 2020, veterans continue to die by suicide 
8
at higher rates than civilians. Many of those vet-

erans have no ties to the Department of Veterans

Affairs, limiting the ability of the Department to 
1
help in times of crisis. 
2
(2) The first year after separating from the 
3
military is a critical time in the transition to civilian 
4
life for a member of the Armed Forces. Many 
5
changes occur during that transition, from career 
6
and location changes to shifts in financial cir-
7
cumstances and health care coverage.

13
to resources that such members of the Armed 
14

15
(2) supporting the critical time of transition by 
16
ensuring that mental health needs are met in a time-
17
