•HR 3811 IH
(1) United States policy has allowed industry in 
1
the United States to innovate and lead the global 
2
technology sector; 
3
(2) as governments have sought to use country- 
4
specific standards to hinder the innovation and in-
5
fluence of United States technology, the United 
6
States should demonstrate leadership and be a vocal 
7
supporter of the open, voluntary, consensus-based 
8
international standards system; 
9
(3) the United States should support multi- 
10
stakeholder standards-development processes and ro-
11
bust involvement in international standards-setting 
12
bodies and organizations with respect to internet- 
13
connected devices (commonly known as the ‘‘Internet 
14
of Things’’ or ‘‘IoT’’); 
15
(4) the United States should support standards 
16
that enable interoperability among devices and sys-
17
tems and are country-agnostic and vendor-neutral; 
18
(5) the United States should maintain and fos-
19
ter United States leadership in international stand-
20
ards-setting bodies and organizations with respect to 
21
internet-connected devices;

(6) the United States should work with govern-
23

cific standards, which can be detrimental to inter-
1
operability and security; 
2
(7) the convergence of traditional information 
3
technology devices, networks, and systems with 
4
internet-connected devices, networks, and systems, 
5
including consumer and industrial internet-connected 
6
devices, networks, and systems, may create cyberse-
7
curity and interoperability challenges, including 
8
cyber exposure gap challenges, with respect to which 
9
United States leadership in international standards- 
10
setting bodies and organizations can lead to stronger 
11
protection of networks to support the security of 
12
internet-connected devices; and 
13
(8) the United States should support standards- 
14
development processes for internet-connected device 
15
security that focus on prioritized, flexible, repeat-
16
able, performance-based, and cost-effective ap-
17
proaches to cyber hygiene and managing risk.

fective approaches to cyber hygiene and managing 
18
risk.
