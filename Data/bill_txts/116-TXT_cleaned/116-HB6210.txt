SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) In the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Re-
3
gion, the Government of the People’s Republic of 
4
China has established a system of extrajudicial mass 
5
internment camps arbitrarily detaining as many as 
6
1.8 million Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and members 
7
of other Muslim minority groups who have been sub-
8
jected to forced labor, torture, political indoctrina-
9
tion, and severe human rights abuses. 
10
(2) Forced labor exists within the Xinjiang 
11
Uyghur Autonomous Region’s system of mass in-
12
ternment camps, and throughout the region, and is 
13
confirmed by the testimony of former camp detain-
14
ees, satellite imagery, and official leaked documents 
15
from the government of the People’s Republic of 
16
China as part of a targeted campaign of repression 
17
of Muslim ethnic minorities. 
18
(3) There is a very high risk that many fac-
19
tories and other suppliers in the Xinjiang Uyghur 
20
Autonomous Region are exploiting forced labor ac-
21
cording to reports from researchers, media, and civil 
22
society groups. Audits to vet products and supply 
23
chains in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region 
24
are not possible due to the extent forced labor has 
25
contaminated the regional economy, the mixing of 
26

•HR 6210 IH
involuntary labor with voluntary labor, the inability 
1
of witnesses to speak freely about working conditions 
2
given heavy government surveillance and coercion, 
3
and the strong incentive of government officials to 
4
conceal government-sponsored forced labor. 
5
(4) In its June 2019 Trafficking in Persons Re-
6
port, the Department of State found that ‘‘Authori-
7
ties offer subsidies incentivizing Chinese companies 
8
to open factories in close proximity to the intern-
9
ment camps, and local governments receive addi-
10
tional funds for each inmate forced to work in these 
11
sites at a fraction of minimum wage or without any 
12
compensation.’’. 
13
(5) In September 2019, U.S. Customs and Bor-
14
der Protection issued a ‘‘Withhold Release Order’’ 
15
on garments produced by Hetian Taida Apparel Co., 
16
Ltd. due to ‘‘suspected prison or forced labor’’ from 
17
its factories in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous 
18
Region. 
19
(6) In its 2019 Annual Report, the Congres-
20
sional-Executive Commission on China (CECC) 
21
found that products reportedly produced with forced 
22
labor by current and former mass internment camp 
23
detainees included textiles, electronics, food prod-
24
ucts, shoes, tea, and handicrafts.

(7) According to public reports, the following 
1
companies are or have been suspected of directly em-
2
ploying forced labor or sourcing from suppliers that 
3
are suspected of using forced labor: Adidas, Badger 
4
Sportswear, Calvin Klein, Campbell Soup Company,

10

12

13
(8) Section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 
14
U.S.C. 1307) states that it is illegal to import into 
15
the United States ‘‘goods, wares, articles, and mer-
16
chandise mined, produced, or manufactured wholly 
17
or in part’’ by forced labor. Such merchandise is 
18
subject to exclusion or seizure and may lead to 
19
criminal investigation of the importer.

(9) The policies of the Government of the Peo-
21

22
national human rights standards, including—

24

SEC. 9. DISCLOSURES TO THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE 
1
COMMISSION OF CERTAIN ACTIVITIES RE-
2
LATED TO THE XINJIANG UYGHUR AUTONO-
3
MOUS REGION. 
4
(a) POLICY STATEMENT.—It is the policy of the 
5
United States to protect American investors, though 
6
stronger disclosure requirements, alerting them to the 
7
presence of Chinese and other companies complicit in 
8
gross violations of human rights in United States capital 
9
markets, including American and foreign companies listed 
10
on United States exchanges that enable the mass intern-
11
ment and population surveillance of Uyghurs, Kazakhs, 
12
Kyrgyz, and other Muslim minorities and source products 
13
made with forced labor in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autono-
14
mous Region in China. Such involvements represent clear, 
15
material risks to the share values and corporate reputa-
16
tions of certain of these companies and hence to prospec-
17
tive American investors, particularly given that the United 
18
States Government has employed sanctions and export re-
19
strictions to target individuals and entities contributing to 
20
human rights abuses in China.

(b) DISCLOSURE OF CERTAIN ACTIVITIES RELATING
