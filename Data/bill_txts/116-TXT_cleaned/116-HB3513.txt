Congress finds the following:

•HR 3513 IH
(1) Title IX of the Education Amendments of 
1
1972 (20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.) (in this Act referred 
2
to as ‘‘title IX’’) and the implementing regulations 
3
of title IX prohibit sex discrimination in federally 
4
funded education programs and activities. 
5
(2) Although title IX requires that schools treat 
6
students equally with regard to athletic participation 
7
opportunities, athletic scholarships, and the benefits 
8
and services provided to athletic teams, female par-
9
ticipation rates, especially for girls of color, lag far 
10
behind male participation rates. Currently, only 2⁄3 
11
of Black and Latina girls play sports, and barely 
12
over 1⁄2 of Asian-American girls play sports, com-
13
pared to more than 3⁄4 of White girls. Female stu-
14
dent athletes have been found to have higher levels 
15
of self-esteem and to be more likely to graduate 
16
from high school than female students who do not 
17
play sports. Although the availability of athletic 
18
scholarships facilitates access to higher education, 
19
many schools fail to award proportional athletic fi-
20
nancial aid to women, which can affect their long- 
21
term employment outcomes and economic security. 
22
(3) Although title IX ensures gender equity in 
23
career and technical education, women are severely 
24
underrepresented in fields nontraditional to their 
25

gender. A recent study by the National Coalition for 
1
Women and Girls in Education indicated that 
2
women make up more than 80 percent of workers 
3
with training or certification in historically women- 
4
dominated occupations that pay less than $30,000 
5
per year, including child care, early childhood edu-
6
cation, home care, and cosmetology. Women rep-
7
resent less than 40 percent of workers trained or 
8
certified in high-paying and historically male-domi-
9
nated fields, including transportation, advanced 
10
manufacturing, and construction. 
11
(4) Although title IX ensures gender equity in 
12
the fields of science, technology, engineering, and 
13
mathematics 
(in 
this 
section 
referred 
to 
as 
14
‘‘STEM’’) education, women are disproportionately 
15
lost at nearly every stage of the STEM pipeline. A 
16
recent report by the National Center for Education 
17
Statistics showed that women earned only 32 per-
18
cent of all STEM degrees in 2017, and nearly 1⁄2 of 
19
these women were White. Women of color earned 
20
about 12 percent of STEM degrees in that same 
21
year. Furthermore, in STEM fields where women 
22
are particularly underrepresented, such as com-
23
puting and engineering, women earned an even 
24
smaller percentage of degrees, including only 19 per-
25

cent of computing bachelor’s degrees, and 21 per-
1
cent of engineering bachelor’s degrees. 
2
(5) Although title IX prohibits sex discrimina-
3
tion in employment in federally funded education 
4
programs, a recent report by the American Associa-
5
tion of University Women found that women com-
6
prise only 36 percent of tenured faculty and 30 per-
7
cent of university presidents. A similar study by the 
8
National Science Foundation confirmed that women 
9
only hold 34 percent of all tenured and tenure-track 
10
positions, and 27 percent of full professor positions 
11
in STEM fields. Furthermore, Black and Latina 
12
women, together, hold only 4 percent of all tenured 
13
and tenure-track positions, and barely over 2 percent 
14
of full professor positions in STEM fields. Asian- 
15
American women hold around 5 percent of all 
16
tenured and tenure-track positions, and less than 3 
17
percent of full professor positions in STEM fields. 
18
(6) Although title IX protects against sexual 
19
and sex-based harassment and violence, more than 
20
50 percent of girls and 40 percent of boys in grades 
21
7 through 12 experience sexual harassment each 
22
year, and approximately 10 percent of high school 
23
students experience dating violence each year. A re-
24
cent GLSEN report indicated that 87 percent of les-
25

bian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and ques-
1
tioning (referred to in this section as ‘‘LGBTQ’’) 
2
students have experienced harassment or assault 
3
based on a personal characteristic, and nearly 66 
4
percent have experienced LGBTQ-related verbal har-
5
assment at school based on sexual orientation. Re-
6
search has shown that LGBTQ students who experi-
7
ence harassment at school are more likely to experi-
8
ence depression and anxiety, to engage in unhealthy 
9
and antisocial behaviors, and to have more unex-
10
cused absences from school. 
11
(7) Although title IX prohibits discrimination 
12
on the basis of pregnancy or parenting status, the 
13
limited availability of accommodations for preg-
14
nancy-related conditions, including medical absences, 
15
and the limited access to school-related activities for 
16
pregnant and parenting students, are the leading 
17
reasons that parenting mothers drop out of high 
18
school. A recent report by the National Women’s 
19
Law Center indicated that only 1⁄2 of teenage moth-
20
ers earn a high school diploma by the age of 22, 
21
compared with 89 percent of women who do not 
22
have a child during their teenage years, and that 1⁄3 
23
of young mothers will never get a diploma or GED,

further limiting continuing opportunities for edu-
1
cation and employment. 
2
(8) Although title IX protects against discrimi-
3
nation based on stereotypes of actual or perceived 
4
sex (including sexual orientation or gender identity), 
5
many people carry implicit or unconscious biases 
6
that can unintentionally influence attitudes, beliefs, 
7
behaviors, and decisionmaking processes. Research 
8
has shown that unconscious biases can impact class-
9
room environments, teaching methods, student eval-
10
uations, disciplinary practices, and career and coun-
11
seling guidance, particularly for students who are 
12
pursuing nontraditional fields.
