SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Suicide Training and 
2
Awareness Nationally Delivered for Universal Prevention 
3
Act of 2020’’ or the ‘‘STANDUP Act of 2020’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
5
The Congress finds as follows: 
6
(1) Since 2010, suicide has been the second- 
7
leading cause of death for young people ages 10–24. 
8
In 2016, 6,159 young people ages 10–24 died by 
9
suicide. 
10
(2) Based on the 2017 Youth Risk Behavior 
11
Survey of the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
12
vention (in this section referred to as ‘‘CDC’’), 7.4 
13
percent of youth in grades 9–12 reported that they 
14
made at least one suicide attempt in the past 12 
15
months. 
16
(3) While there is no complete count of suicide 
17
attempts in the United States, CDC data suggests 
18
that for every reported suicide death, approximately 
19
11.4 people visit a hospital for self-harm-related in-
20
juries. 
21
(4) In 2016, suicide was the 10th-leading cause 
22
of death overall in the United States, with over 
23
44,000 people dying by suicide, and there were more 
24
than twice as many suicides in the United States as 
25
there were homicides.

(5) Youth often display warning signs and sig-
1
nals before harming themselves or others. Research 
2
shows that 70 percent of those who die by suicide 
3
tell someone of their plans or give another warning 
4
sign. 
5
(6) According to the CDC, the rates of suicide 
6
among American Indians and Alaska Natives have 
7
been increasing since 2003 and are the highest of 
8
any racial or ethnic group in the United States. In 
9
addition, recent studies of CDC data from 2001 
10
through 2015 show that suicide rates for Black chil-
11
dren ages 5 through 12 were roughly two times 
12
higher than those of similarly aged White children.
