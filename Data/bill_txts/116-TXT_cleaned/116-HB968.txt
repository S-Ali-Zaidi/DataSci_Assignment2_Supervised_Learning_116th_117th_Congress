5
United States, Mr. Donald Trump stated ‘‘I would 
6
build a great wall, and nobody builds walls better 
7
than me, believe me, and I’ll build them very inex-
8
pensively. I will build a great, great wall on our 
9
southern border. And I will have Mexico pay for that 
10
wall. Mark my words.’’.

these other characters say, ‘Oh, they won’t pay, they

the wall.’’.
