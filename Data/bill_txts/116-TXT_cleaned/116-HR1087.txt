RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the importance and significance of the Justice 
Bell in the women’s suffrage movement. 
Whereas, in 1915, the Justice Bell, also referred to as the 
‘‘Women’s Liberty Bell’’ and the ‘‘Suffrage Bell’’, was 
created by Katharine Wentworth Ruschenberger, a mem-
ber of the Pennsylvania Woman Suffrage Association, 
and is a close replica of the Liberty Bell; 
Whereas the Justice Bell is inscribed with the words ‘‘Estab-
lish Justice’’; 
Whereas, in 1915, the Justice Bell was taken on a driving 
tour throughout 67 counties in Pennsylvania to raise 
awareness for women’s suffrage with the clapper on the 
bell notably not ringing, symbolizing the silence of women 
who did not have a vote;
