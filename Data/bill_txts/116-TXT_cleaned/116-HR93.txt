of the sovereign state of Georgia and condemning the 
decision by the Syrian Arab Republic to recognize these

sions in Afghanistan and the Multi-National Force in 
Iraq; 
Whereas Georgia maintains peaceful relations with its neigh-
bors in the Caucasus region and has been a reliable part-
ner in promoting peace and democracy in the Eurasia re-
gion; 
Whereas the United States and its partners must stand up 
against the Russian Federation’s expansion into terri-
tories of the former Soviet Union; 
Whereas the Russian Federation violates international law by 
continuously occupying sovereign territory in Georgia and 
has on multiple occasions meddled in the affairs of Geor-
gia during the war in Abkhazia from 1992–1993 and 
during the Russo-Georgian war in August 2008; 
Whereas only 5 member states of the United Nations recog-
nize Abkhazia or South Ossetia as independent of Geor-
gia; 
Whereas the Syrian Arab Republic is a failed client-state of 
the Russian Federation and the Islamic Republic of Iran; 
and 
Whereas the Russian Federation, in its effort to disrupt the 
West and its allies, will use failed states such as the Syr-
ian Arab Republic to push its geopolitical agenda and 
lend credibility to the territories it illegally occupies: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—

(1) recognizes Georgia’s sovereignty and terri-
