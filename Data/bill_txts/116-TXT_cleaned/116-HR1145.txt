Whereas Mr. Navalny has been imprisoned multiple times for 
participating in unsanctioned protests; 
Whereas Mr. Navalny was attacked twice with a chemical 
substance in 2017 and potentially poisoned in 2019 while 
in prison; 
Whereas over the years a number of Russian journalists, 
human rights activists, politicians, whistleblowers, and 
others have been killed or died under mysterious cir-
cumstances, in Russia and overseas, including— 
(1) former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko (in 
London) and investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya 
in 2006; 
(2) human rights lawyer Stanislav Markelov, jour-
nalist Anastasia Baburova, and human rights activist

a domestic flight in Russia; 
Whereas, on August 22, 2020, Mr. Navalny was evacuated by

protection and to ensure he would receive a high stand-
ard of health care to improve his chances of recovery; 
Whereas German chemical weapons experts conducted tests 
and found ‘‘unequivocal’’ evidence that Mr. Navalny had

from the Novichok group;

peatedly denied that Mr. Navalny was poisoned;

•HRES 1145 IH 
Whereas the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany 
has called on the Government of the Russian Federation 
to open an investigation into Mr. Navalny’s case; 
Whereas the Russian Federation is a state party to the Inter-
national Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR); 
Whereas Article 6 of the ICCPR states that ‘‘Every human 
being has the inherent right to life’’ and ‘‘No one shall 
be arbitrarily deprived of his life’’; 
Whereas Article 9 of the ICCPR states that ‘‘Everyone has 
the right to liberty and security of person.’’; 
Whereas the Russian Federation is a member of the Organi-
zation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE); 
Whereas respect for human rights is key to the OSCE’s com-
prehensive approach to security and therefore the OSCE 
monitors the human rights situation in its 57 partici-
pating states; 
Whereas Congress passed the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law 
Accountability Act of 2012 (title IV of Public Law 112– 
208) and the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Account-
ability Act (subtitle F of title XII of Public Law 114– 
328) in 2016 which provide the United States Govern-
ment with authorities to respond to grave violations of 
human rights and corruption in Russia; and 
Whereas in response to a previous Novichok attack against 
a United Kingdom national and his daughter in 2018, 
the United States Government imposed two rounds of 
sanctions on Russia pursuant to the Chemical and Bio-
logical Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act of 
1991 (Public Law 102–182; 22 U.S.C. 5601 et seq.): 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
