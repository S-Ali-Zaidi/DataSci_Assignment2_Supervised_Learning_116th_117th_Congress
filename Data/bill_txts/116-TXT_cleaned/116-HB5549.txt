A BILL 
To authorize the President to award the Medal of Honor 
to Doris Miller posthumously for acts of valor while 
a member of the Navy during World War II. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. FINDINGS. 
3
Congress finds the following: 
4
(1) Doris Miller, like other African-American 
5
sailors of his day, was generally relegated to service- 
6
based roles on ships, as the Navy did not allow sail-
7
ors of color to enlist in combat roles.

(2) Doris Miller was acknowledged in the USS 
1
West Virginia Action Report, individually, along 
2
with other brave personnel for having ‘‘carried out 
3
every order promptly and enthusiastically, even when 
4
it meant danger to themselves. They did not attempt 
5
to abandon the bridge until ordered to do so’’. 
6
(3) Doris Miller aided other service members 
7
and ‘‘was instrumental in hauling people along 
8
through oil and water to the quarterdeck, thereby 
9
unquestionably saving the lives of a number of peo-
10
ple who might otherwise have been lost’’. 
11
(4) On December 15, 1941, the Navy released 
12
its commendations for actions in Pearl Harbor 
13
which included one ‘‘unnamed Negro’’. It wasn’t 
14
until March of 1942, at the behest of the NAACP, 
15
that the Navy formally recognized Miller’s heroism. 
16
(5) Doris Miller was recognized by the Navy 
17
and awarded the Navy Cross Medal with the citation 
18
reading ‘‘For distinguished devotion to duty, ex-
19
traordinary courage and disregard for his own per-
20
sonal safety during the attack on the Fleet in Pearl 
21
Harbor, Territory of Hawaii, by Japanese forces on 
22
December 7, 1941. While at the side of his Captain 
23
on the bridge, Miller, despite enemy strafing and 
24
bombing and in the face of a serious fire, assisted

in moving his Captain, who had been mortally 
1
wounded, to a place of greater safety, and later 
2
manned and operated a machine gun directed at 
3
enemy Japanese attacking aircraft until ordered to 
4
leave the bridge.’’. 
5
(6) On May 27, 1942, Admiral Chester Nimitz 
6
personally pinned the Navy Cross to Miller’s left 
7
breast pocket while on board the aircraft carrier 
8
USS Enterprise. 
9
(7) Doris Miller died in action on November 24, 
10
1943, on board the USS Liscome Bay in the Pacific 
11
Ocean after a single Japanese torpedo sank the ves-
12
sel off the coast of Butaritari Island. 
13
(8) Of the 15 sailors who were awarded the 
14
Medal of Honor for similar actions taken during the 
15
attack on Pearl Harbor, not one was African-Amer-
16
ican. 
17
(9) Doris Miller deserves the highest honor the 
18
United States can bestow upon a member of the 
19
Armed Forces.
