SEC. 2. PURPOSE. 
1
The purpose of this Act is to protect the integrity 
2
of American democracy by expanding the scope of the pro-
3
hibition on political advertising by foreign principals in 
4
order to uphold the well-established standard of the 
5
United States Supreme Court that foreign nationals may 
6
lawfully be excluded from participating in certain electoral 
7
activities. 
8
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
9
It is the sense of Congress that— 
10
(1) the growing threat of malicious interference 
11
in our elections by foreign actors requires the Con-
12
gress and the Federal Election Commission to take 
13
meaningful action to ensure that laws and regula-
14
tions protect against influence by foreign nationals 
15
in activity fundamental to our democracy; 
16
(2) the Supreme Court has long held that there 
17
is a compelling national interest in preventing for-
18
eign influence in the United States political process 
19
and that foreign citizens lack a ‘‘constitutional right 
20
to participate in, and thus may be excluded from, 
21
activities of democratic self-government’’; and 
22
(3) the current prohibition on foreign nationals 
23
contributing to political campaigns and advertise-
24
ments must be updated.
