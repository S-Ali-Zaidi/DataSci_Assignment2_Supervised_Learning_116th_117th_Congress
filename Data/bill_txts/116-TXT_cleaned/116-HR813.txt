RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the 
Auschwitz concentration camp. 
Whereas, on January 27, 1945, Allied troops entered the 
Auschwitz complex concentration camp and liberated the 
more than 7,000 still-living prisoners; 
Whereas during World War II, the Nazi regime, its allies, 
and its collaborators systematically killed approximately 
6,000,000 Jews, including 1,500,000 million Jewish chil-
dren, as well as millions of others including Roma, men-
tally or physically disabled people, gay men, political pris-
oners and resistance members, Poles and other Slavs, 
and Soviet prisoners of war; 
Whereas two-thirds of European Jewry and one-third of 
world Jewry were killed as a result of Nazi persecution 
during World War II; 
Whereas at least 1,300,000 people were deported to Ausch-
witz between 1940 and 1945, approximately 1,100,000 of 
whom were murdered; 
Whereas thousands of prisoners at Auschwitz were selected 
by Josef Mengele and other Auschwitz physicians to be 
the victims of cruel and unethical medical experimen-
tation; 
Whereas in the days leading up to the liberation of Ausch-
witz, tens of thousands of prisoners were forced to par-

Whereas the Nazis murdered their victims in Auschwitz by

jecting them to forced labor, and by denying them even 
the most basic medical treatment for disease or infection; 
Whereas according to The Conference on Jewish Material 
Claims Against Germany, there are over 80,000 Holo-
caust survivors living in the United States and over a 
third live below the poverty line; 
Whereas there has been an increase in the number and inten-
sity of antisemitic incidents around the world and in the 
United States, including the single deadliest attack 
against the Jewish community in the history of the 
United States at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pitts-
burgh in 2018 and a series of attacks against Jews 
across the country, which has increased feelings of vul-
nerability among Jewish communities; and 
Whereas antisemites in America and around the world con-
tinue to invoke Nazi ideology and use symbols such as 
the swastika and other fascist imagery to vandalize syna-
gogues and Jewish institutions; Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
