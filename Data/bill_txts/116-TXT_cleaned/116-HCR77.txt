•HCON 77 IH 
(1) Congress has the sole power to declare war 
1
under article I, section 8 of the Constitution. 
2
(2) Congress has not declared war with respect 
3
to, or provided any specific statutory authorization 
4
for, United States military participation in any ac-
5
tivity related to securing, guarding, possessing, prof-
6
iting off of, or developing the oil fields of the Syrian 
7
Arab Republic.

(3) President Donald Trump stated on October 
9
27, 2019, regarding Syria that ‘‘we are leaving sol-
10
diers to secure the oil. Now, we may have to fight 
11
for the oil. That’s OK. Maybe somebody else wants 
12
the oil, in which case they have a hell of a fight.’’ 
13
and that ‘‘it can help us, because we should be able 
14
to take some also. And what I intend to do, perhaps, 
15
is make a deal with an ExxonMobil or one of our 
16
great companies to go in there and do it properly. 
17
Right now it’s not big. It’s big oil underground but 
18
it’s not big oil up top.’’. 
19
(4) When asked by CNN on October 28, 2019, 
20
whether the United States will prevent any Russian 
21
or Syrian Government forces from gaining access to 
22
the oil, Secretary of Defense Esper said, ‘‘The short 
23
answer is yes, it presently does.’’.
