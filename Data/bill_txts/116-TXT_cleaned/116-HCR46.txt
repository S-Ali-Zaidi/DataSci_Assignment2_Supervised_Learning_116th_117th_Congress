CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the designation of June 21 as Na-
tional ASK (Asking Saves Kids) Day to promote chil-
dren’s health and safe storage of guns in the home. 
Whereas according to estimates from the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, in 2016, on average, 8 children 
and teens per day were injured or killed from the unin-
tentional discharge of a firearm; 
Whereas 1.7 million children in the United States live in 
homes with loaded and unlocked guns; 
Whereas in States that collect data through the National Vio-
lent Death Reporting System, on average, 80 percent of 
unintentional firearm deaths of children under 15 oc-
curred in a home;

Whereas in approximately 75 percent of school shootings by 
a student, the gun was brought from their home or the 
home of a family member and owned by an adult family 
member; 
Whereas the ASK Campaign encourages parents to add a 
question to a conversation before their child visits other 
homes, ‘‘Is there a gun in your house?’’, and follow af-
firmative answers with, ‘‘Is it locked and unloaded?’’; 
Whereas asking these simple questions about gun safety be-
fore sending your child to visit or play at another home 
could help save your child’s life; 
Whereas asking these questions will raise awareness of the 
need for safe storage of guns in the home as a proven 
effective preventative safety measure; 
Whereas asking these questions will prevent incidents of fam-
ily fire, in which an improperly stored or misused gun re-
sults in injury or death; 
Whereas the ASK Campaign was first established with the 
American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) in 2000 and is 
currently administered by the Brady Campaign; 
Whereas the president of the AAP has said, ‘‘Keeping chil-
dren and teens safe from preventable injuries is one of 
the most important things we do as pediatricians.’’; 
Whereas a November 2017 Government Accountability Office 
report, ‘‘Personal Firearms: Programs that Promote Safe 
Storage and Research on Their Effectiveness’’, identified 
16 public or nonprofit programs that promote safe gun 
storage, including the ASK program, and reported that 
the ASK Program was the only national program to be 
evaluated and validated as effective;

Whereas June 21, the first day of summer, the season in 
which kids typically spend more time at a friend’s or 
family member’s home, has traditionally been designated 
as National ASK Day; 
Whereas the Brady Center and Campaign, its more than 100 
chapters in a majority of States throughout the Nation, 
and its many local, State, and national partners come to-
gether to highlight the ASK Campaign each year in com-
munities across the Nation; and 
Whereas June 21, 2019, is designated by national organiza-
tions, as well as various local and State governments, in-
cluding State legislatures, as the 16th annual National 
ASK Day: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate 
1
concurring), That Congress— 
2
(1) supports the designation of National ASK 
3
(Asking Saves Kids) Day to encourage parents to 
4
begin asking this life-saving question; 
5
(2) encourages public health, medical, and other 
6
professionals to discuss gun ownership, gun safety, 
7
and safe storage in the home with their patients and 
8
parents and guardians of minors; and 
9
(3) supports the goals and ideals of National 
10
ASK Day.
