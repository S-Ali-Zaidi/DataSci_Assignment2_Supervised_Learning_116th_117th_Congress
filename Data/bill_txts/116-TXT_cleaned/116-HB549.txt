•HR 549 IH
(1) Venezuela is enduring an unprecedented 
1
economic, humanitarian, security, and refugee crisis, 
2
consisting of extreme food and medicine shortages, 
3
severe infant and child malnutrition, rampant crime, 
4
and government-sponsored repression. 
5
(2) 
Venezuela’s 
economic 
crisis 
continues 
6
unabated and the International Monetary Fund 
7
projects that inflation in Venezuela could reach an 
8
annual rate of 10,000,000 percent in 2019. 
9
(3) In 2017, the Office of the High Commis-
10
sioner for Human Rights reported the deaths of 124 
11
persons that could be attributed to violations of the 
12
right to freedom of peaceful assembly. 
13
(4) From September 2017 through April 2018, 
14
a review of pharmacies in five major cities shows a 
15
shortage of nearly 85 percent of medicine essential 
16
to treat four of the most recurrent causes of mor-
17
bidity in the country, diarrhea, respiratory tract in-
18
fections, diabetes, and high blood pressure. 
19
(5) As evidence of the significant effect that 
20
Venezuela’s economic crisis has on public health, 
21
Venezuela’s Health Ministry reported that in 
22
2016— 
23
(A) there was a 30-percent increase in the 
24
infant mortality rate; and

•HR 549 IH
(B) there was a 60-percent increase in the 
1
maternal mortality rate.

(6) According to the United Nations Human 
3
Rights Office of the High Commissioner, Venezuelan 
4
intelligence and security forces have increasingly 
5
used arbitrary arrests and detentions to repress and 
6
intimidate civil society, political opponents, and any 
7
voices of dissent. 
8
(7) Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein, the United Nations 
9
High Commissioner for Human Rights, stated, ‘‘The 
10
failure to hold security forces accountable for such 
11
serious human rights violations suggests that the 
12
rule of law is virtually absent in Venezuela.’’. 
13
(8) According to the United Nations High Com-
14
missioner for Human Rights, since 2014 more than 
15
1,500,000 Venezuelans have fled the country for 
16
reasons including violence, political oppression, and 
17
the ongoing humanitarian crisis.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
19
It is the sense of the Congress that— 
20
(1) Venezuela’s economic, humanitarian, secu-
21
rity, and refugee crisis has resulted in extraordinary 
22
and temporary conditions that currently prevent 
23
Venezuelan nationals from safely returning to Ven-
24
ezuela; and
