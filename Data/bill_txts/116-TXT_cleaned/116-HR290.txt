RESOLUTION 
Supporting increased awareness of sepsis and the importance 
of early diagnosis and appropriate intervention. 
Whereas sepsis is a medical condition resulting from an im-
mune system response to an infection; 
Whereas this overwhelming response to infection can rapidly 
lead to tissue damage, organ failure, and death; 
Whereas over 1.7 million individuals in the United States de-
velop sepsis each year; 
Whereas over 270,000 individuals in the United States die 
from sepsis each year, more than from prostate cancer, 
breast cancer, and HIV/AIDS combined; 
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention esti-
mates that one in three patients who die in a hospital 
have sepsis;

Whereas according to the Agency for Healthcare Research 
and Quality, sepsis is the most common diagnosis for in-
patient hospital stays in the United States; 
Whereas sepsis is the most expensive condition treated in 
hospitals in the United States, consuming over $24 bil-
lion each year; 
Whereas sepsis is the number one cause of hospital readmis-
sions, generating over $2 billion in costs annually; 
Whereas over 80 percent of septic patients are septic upon 
admission to the hospital; 
Whereas mortality from septic shock increases by up to 8 
percent for every hour that treatment is delayed; 
Whereas rapid diagnosis and treatment can prevent up to 80 
percent of sepsis fatalities; and 
Whereas the combination of early detection of sepsis and ap-
propriate interventions can significantly improve the 
chances of survival for patients with all types of sepsis: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
