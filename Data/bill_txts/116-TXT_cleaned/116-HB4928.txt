COUNSEL.

It is the sense of Congress that—

(1) immigration law is so complex that it is 
19
nearly impossible and therefore unjust for individ-
20
uals to navigate the immigration system without 
21
legal assistance or represent themselves in immigra-
22
tion court; 
23
(2) noncitizens without legal counsel are far 
24
more likely to be denied immigration benefits or be

deported, which can result in dire consequences, in-

cluding the denial of legal status or U.S. citizenship,

loss of livelihood, separation from or the inability to

support one’s family, life-threatening danger in one’s 
4
country of origin and a long-term or permanent ban 
5
from being able to re-enter the United States; and 
6
(3) consistent with the American values of fair-
7
ness and justice and the Fifth Amendment to the 
8
U.S. Constitution which guarantees everyone due 
9
process of law, anyone subject to proceedings or the 
10
appeal thereof before an immigration judge or the 
11
Attorney General should have the right of being rep-
12
resented by counsel, including government-funded 
13
counsel, regardless of one’s ability to pay.
