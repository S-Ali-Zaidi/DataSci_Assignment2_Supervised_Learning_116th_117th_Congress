(2) The United Nations Commission of Inquiry 
1
on Human Rights in North Korea concluded in 2014 
2
that Kim Jong Un and the North Korean leadership 
3
was perpetrating ‘‘unspeakable atrocities’’ against 
4
its own people on a vast scale and committed ‘‘wide-
5
spread, systematic, and gross violations’’ that 
6
amount to crimes against humanity. 
7
(3) The chair of the United Nations Commis-
8
sion of Inquiry on Human Rights in North Korea 
9
called these atrocities ‘‘strikingly similar’’ to crimes 
10
committed by Nazi Germany in World War II, in-
11
cluding execution, enslavement, starvation, rape, and 
12
forced abortion, and warned Kim Jong Un of his 
13
own personal culpability in a special letter attached 
14
to the report. 
15
(4) Under Kim Jong Un’s leadership, there are 
16
reports of newborn babies in prison being fed to 
17
guard dogs, punishment and possible execution of 
18
starving prisoners caught digging for edible plants, 
19
and forced abortions.

(5) Kim Jong Un, after taking over the leader-
21
ship of North Korea, launched political purges, en-

1
lege student, was brutally tortured by the North Ko-

(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
5
gress that—

denuclearization should include an equivalent de-
8
mand for transparency regarding North Korea’s 
9
human rights situation; 
10
(2) the United States should not trust Kim 
11
Jong Un and the leadership of North Korea to vol-
12
untarily and peacefully end its nuclear program as 
13
long as they continue to commit mass atrocities 
14
against the North Korean people; and 
15
(3) no sanctions relief should be provided to 
16
North Korea until the President certifies to the ap-
17
propriate congressional committees that the lives of 
18
ordinary North Koreans are improving and the Kim 
19
family has made progress on North Korea’s deplor-
20
able human rights situation. 
21
(c) LIMITATION ON WAIVER OF SANCTIONS.—The 
22
President may not waive, suspend, reduce, provide relief 
23
from, or otherwise limit the application of United States

sanctions imposed with respect to North Korea until the

5
(2) has established a disclosure and trans-
6
