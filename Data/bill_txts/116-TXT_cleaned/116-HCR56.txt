CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the Congress that a commemorative 
postage stamp should be issued honoring Martha Matilda 
Harper, and that the Citizens’ Stamp Advisory Com-
mittee should recommend to the Postmaster General that 
such a stamp be issued. 
Whereas Martha Matilda Harper, after spending much of the 
first 25 years of her life as a domestic servant, opened 
the Harper Method Shops and School, a health-conscious 
hair and skin care store in Rochester, New York, in 
1888; 
Whereas Martha Matilda Harper subsequently expanded the 
business to include 2 international manufacturing cen-
ters, 5 training schools, and over 500 beauty shops 
around the world;

Whereas Martha Matilda Harper shared the opportunity of 
business ownership with former servant women, and cre-
ated the first franchise business model; 
Whereas customers of Harper shops included world leaders, 
socialites, and suffragists, such as Presidents Woodrow 
Wilson and Calvin Coolidge, Kaiser Wilhelm II, Prime 
Minister Anthony Eden, First Ladies Jacqueline Ken-
nedy and Lady Bird Johnson, and Susan B. Anthony; 
Whereas Martha Matilda Harper’s 19th century management 
practices, which included a customer-oriented focus, an 
equitable relationship with staff, a childcare center in 
each shop, and the manufacture and promotion of or-
ganic products and procedures, would be laudable by to-
day’s standards; 
Whereas Martha Matilda Harper pioneered the franchise 
business model that today has directly created 7.6 million 
jobs and adds nearly $700 billion annually to the United 
States economy; and 
Whereas for her accomplishments, Martha Matilda Harper 
has been referred to by some as the ‘‘mother of fran-
chising’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate 
1
concurring), That it is the sense of the Congress that— 
2
(1) a commemorative postage stamp should be 
3
issued honoring Martha Matilda Harper; and 
4
(2) the Citizens’ Stamp Advisory Committee 
5
should recommend to the Postmaster General that 
6
such a stamp be issued.
