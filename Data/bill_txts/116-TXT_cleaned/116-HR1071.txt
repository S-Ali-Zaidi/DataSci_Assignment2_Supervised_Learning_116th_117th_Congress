RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the Nation’s law enforcement officers. 
Whereas law enforcement officers protect the American peo-
ple from criminals who seek to perpetrate violence and 
harm innocent lives regardless of the political cir-
cumstances of the day; 
Whereas America’s law enforcement community also seeks to 
assist the communities they serve through a variety of 
nontraditional means, including nonarrest pathways that 
connect individuals with treatment and recovery pro-
grams to overcome addiction, and juvenile diversion pro-
grams to prevent minors from entering the criminal jus-
tice system;

Whereas supporting law enforcement officers with the equip-
ment, training, and funding necessary to serve our com-
munities and keep our streets safe has long been a bipar-
tisan issue, dating back to President Clinton and then- 
Senator Biden joining their Republican colleagues to pass 
the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 
1994; 
Whereas law enforcement officers willingly face dangerous 
circumstances and the threat of serious bodily injury or 
death on a daily basis to ensure the safety of all Ameri-
cans; 
Whereas the National Law Enforcement Memorial and Mu-
seum reports that as of December 31, 2019, 1,627 law 
enforcement officers had died in the line of duty during 
the past decade, a rate of one law enforcement death 
every 54 hours; 
Whereas the National Law Enforcement Memorial and Muse-
um’s 2020 Mid-Year Law Enforcement Officers Fatali-
ties Report detailed that 65 law enforcement officers have 
been killed in the line of duty this year, including 27 offi-
cers who were killed in firearms-related incidents; 
Whereas peaceful protests sparked by the death of George 
Floyd have been hijacked by violent extremists and pro-
gressive groups seeking to sow discord, damage property, 
loot businesses, and inflict harm against civilians and law 
enforcement officers; 
Whereas law enforcement officers have been run over, shot, 
hit with objects, and stabbed attempting to maintain 
peace and the rule of law during the violent protests fol-
lowing George Floyd’s death;

Whereas the New York Post reported on June 8, 2020, that 
more than 700 Federal, State, and local law enforcement 
officers have been injured during protests resulting from 
George Floyd’s death; 
Whereas progressive politicians and interest groups have re-
sponded to this violence with calls to defund law enforce-
ment agencies across the Nation; 
Whereas defunding or otherwise handcuffing law enforcement 
officers will make officers less likely to intervene in dan-
gerous situations and will result in law enforcement pull-
ing back from the neighborhoods they are entrusted to 
protect; 
Whereas violent crime increases when law enforcement is 
forced to withdraw from neighborhoods; 
Whereas, on May 31, 2020, 18 people were murdered in Chi-
cago; 
Whereas over the course of the full weekend, 85 Chicagoans 
were shot, 24 fatally, as residents experienced the dead-
liest weekend in the city’s history as police withdrew from 
the neighborhoods to deal with violent rioting; 
Whereas, for the month of June 2020, New York City re-
ported steep increases in violent crime, including a 130.3- 
percent increase in shooting incidents, a 30-percent spike 
in murders, and a 118.2-percent rise in burglaries as po-
lice faced a stiff round of budget cuts and reduced sup-
port from local officials; 
Whereas Minneapolis has seen a 55-percent increase in homi-
cides this year as Minneapolis City Council officials con-
tinue pushing to dismantle the city’s police department 
while hiring private security details for their own per-
sonal protection; and
