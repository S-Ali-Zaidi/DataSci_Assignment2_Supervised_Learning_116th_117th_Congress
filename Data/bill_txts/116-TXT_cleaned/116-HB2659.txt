A BILL 
To establish a research, development, and technology dem-
onstration program to improve the efficiency of gas tur-
bines used in combined cycle and simple cycle power 
generation systems. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. HIGH EFFICIENCY GAS TURBINES. 
3
(a) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary of Energy, through 
4
the Office of Fossil Energy, shall carry out a multiyear, 
5
multiphase program of research, development, and tech-
6
nology demonstration to improve the efficiency of gas tur-
7
bines used in power generation systems and to identify

the technologies that ultimately will lead to gas turbine 
1
combined cycle efficiency of 67 percent or simple cycle effi-
2
ciency of 50 percent. 
3
(b) PROGRAM ELEMENTS.—The program under this 
4
section shall— 
5
(1) support first-of-a-kind engineering and de-
6
tailed gas turbine design for megawatt-scale and 
7
utility-scale electric power generation, including— 
8
(A) high temperature materials, including 
9
superalloys, coatings, and ceramics; 
10
(B) improved heat transfer capability; 
11
(C) manufacturing technology required to 
12
construct complex three-dimensional geometry 
13
parts with improved aerodynamic capability; 
14
(D) combustion technology to produce 
15
higher firing temperature while lowering nitro-
16
gen oxide and carbon monoxide emissions per 
17
unit of output; 
18
(E) advanced controls and systems integra-
19
tion; 
20
(F) advanced high performance compressor 
21
technology; and 
22
(G) validation facilities for the testing of 
23
components and subsystems;

(2) include technology demonstration through 
1
component testing, subscale testing, and full-scale 
2
testing in existing fleets; 
3
(3) include field demonstrations of the devel-
4
oped technology elements so as to demonstrate tech-
5
nical and economic feasibility; and 
6
(4) assess overall combined cycle and simple 
7
cycle system performance. 
8
(c) PROGRAM GOALS.—The goals of the multiphase 
9
program established under subsection (a) shall be— 
10
(1) in phase I— 
11
(A) to develop the conceptual design of ad-
12
vanced high efficiency gas turbines that can 
13
achieve at least 65-percent combined cycle effi-
14
ciency or 47-percent simple cycle efficiency on 
15
a lower heating value basis; and 
16
(B) to develop and demonstrate the tech-
17
nology required for advanced high efficiency gas 
18
turbines that can achieve at least 65-percent 
19
combined cycle efficiency or 47-percent simple 
20
cycle efficiency on a lower heating value basis; 
21
and 
22
(2) in phase II, to develop the conceptual de-
23
sign for advanced high efficiency gas turbines that 
24
can achieve at least 67-percent combined cycle effi-

(d) PROPOSALS.—Within 180 days after the date of 
3
enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall solicit grant and 
4
contract proposals from industry, small businesses, univer-
5
sities, and other appropriate parties for conducting activi-
6
ties under this Act. In selecting proposals, the Secretary 
7
shall emphasize— 
8
(1) the extent to which the proposal will stimu-
9
late the creation or increased retention of jobs in the 
10
United States; and 
11
(2) the extent to which the proposal will pro-
12
mote and enhance United States technology leader-
13
ship. 
14
(e) COMPETITIVE AWARDS.—The provision of fund-
15
ing under this section shall be on a competitive basis with 
16
an emphasis on technical merit. 
17
(f) COST SHARING.—Section 988 of the Energy Pol-
18
icy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. 16352) shall apply to an award 
19
of financial assistance made under this section. 
20
(g) LIMITS ON PARTICIPATION.—The limits on par-
21
ticipation applicable under section 999E of the Energy 
22
Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. 16375) shall apply to finan-
23
cial assistance awarded under this section.
