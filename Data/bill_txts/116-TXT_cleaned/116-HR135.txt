list, stating that there are as few as 15,000 bonobos left

Whereas bonobos share almost 99 percent of the same DNA 
with humans and they are closer genetically to humans 
than they are to gorillas or orangutans; 
Whereas bonobos are the only matriarchal great ape, and fe-
male alliances enable bonobos to maintain social domi-

fatal aggression;

zations, such as Lola ya Bonobo, the only sanctuary for 
bonobos in the world; the staff at Lola ya Bonobo work 
to rescue, rehabilitate, and release bonobos back into the 
wild; and Lola ya Bonobo is located in Kinshasa, DRC, 
on 75 acres of forested land; 
Whereas the Bonobo Project also works with the Wamba

in 1973; 
Whereas bonobos are an endangered species for several rea-

and fragmentation; 
Whereas seven United States zoos have bonobos including the 
San Diego Zoo, Milwaukee County Zoo, Jacksonville Zoo,

ical Garden, Memphis Zoo, and Fort Worth Zoo; the Mil-

priate date to designate as World Bonobo Day: Now, 
therefore, be it
