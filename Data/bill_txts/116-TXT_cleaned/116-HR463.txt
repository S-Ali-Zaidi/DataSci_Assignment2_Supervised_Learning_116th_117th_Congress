sical instruments with them, and built new musical in-

that the United States has produced, combines the musi-
cal traditions of African Americans in New Orleans with

Greenfield, one of the first widely known African-Amer-
ican vocalists, and other early African-American singing

Williams, Rachel Walker Turner, Marian Anderson, and 
Flora Batson Bergen, paved the way for female African- 
American concert singers who have achieved great popu-
larity during the last 50 years; 
Whereas the term ‘‘rhythm and blues’’ originated in the late 
1940s as a way to describe recordings marketed to Afri-
can Americans and replaced the term ‘‘race music’’;

such as Ray Charles, Ruth Brown, Etta James, and Otis 
Redding;

munity in the late 1950s and early 1960s and combines

musical styles such as gospel and rhythm and blues, and 
was popularized by artists such as Chuck Berry, Bo

of hip-hop culture, combines elements of the African- 
American musical tradition (blues, jazz, and soul) with

School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq.) have signifi-
cantly lower scores on the music portion of the National 
Assessment for Educational Progress arts assessment 
than students that are ineligible for that program, which 
suggests that students in low-income families are dis-
advantaged in the subject of music; 
Whereas a recent study showed that nearly 2⁄3 of music en-
semble students were Caucasian and middle class and 
only 15 percent were African American; 
Whereas the same study found that only 7 percent of music
