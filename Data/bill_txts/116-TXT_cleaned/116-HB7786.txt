SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 7786 IH
(1) Law enforcement officers are vital to the 
1
protection and safety of communities. 
2
(2) Elected officials and other senior officials 
3
abuse the public’s trust and endanger their citizens 
4
when they refuse to provide law enforcement services 
5
to protect life and property. 
6
(3) The right to life, liberty, and property are 
7
ensured by the Constitution of the United States, 
8
and the protection of these rights is the duty of the 
9
Federal, State, and local governments. 
10
(4) Many local governments have refused to 
11
protect the fundamental rights described in para-
12
graph (3) by voluntarily standing down law enforce-
13
ment officers and allowing roving mobs to destroy 
14
property and individual livelihoods, including in— 
15
(A) Minneapolis, Minnesota, where unrest 
16
and violence destroyed hundreds of buildings 
17
and further eroded trust in local law enforce-
18
ment officers to devastating effect; and 
19
(B) Portland, Oregon, where a mob set fire 
20
to the Multnomah County Justice Center, 
21
looted numerous businesses in the downtown 
22
area, injured two police officers, and physically 
23
assaulted multiple peaceful protestors and other 
24
individuals.

•HR 7786 IH
(5) Other local governments have gone further 
1
still by recognizing autonomous zones in which law 
2
enforcement officers are not allowed to operate, in-
3
cluding in Seattle, Washington, where the decision of 
4
the Mayor of Seattle to withdraw law enforcement 
5
officers from multiple blocks of the City of Seattle 
6
to create a police free ‘‘autonomous zone’’ led to sig-
7
nificant destruction of property, 4 shootings, and the 
8
murder of 2 young Americans in the zone. 
9
(6) Elected officials or other senior officials in 
10
the State and local governments who refuse to pro-
11
tect life and property from the ravages of a riot or 
12
mob behavior make their communities less safe by 
13
inviting more crime and violence, and act with willful 
14
disregard for the safety, comfort, and livelihoods of 
15
the individuals who they refuse to protect. 
16
(7) State and local governments that publicly 
17
announce the withdrawal of law enforcement protec-
18
tion from individuals or geographical areas so as to 
19
encourage and endorse the political and social view-
20
points of protestors or rioters erode the public’s 
21
trust and fail to provide equal protection of the law.
