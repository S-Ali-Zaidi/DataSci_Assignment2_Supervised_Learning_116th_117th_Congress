dowed with the inalienable rights of life, liberty, and pur-
suit of happiness; 
Whereas the United States was founded as a nation of men 
and women seeking freedom, refuge, and prosperity for 
themselves and their descendants; 
Whereas the United States recognizes the inherent human 
dignity of all individuals; 
Whereas the core values held by the Department of Home-
land Security and U.S. Customs and Border Protection 
include integrity, vigilance, and respect; 
Whereas U.S. Customs and Border Protection acknowledged 
that U.S. Border Patrol stations were built over 30 years 
ago for single adult males, not the humanitarian needs 
of families, and need additional resources to provide med-
ical care, mental health services, and humanitarian as-
sistance; 
Whereas lack of access to adequate medical screenings, emer-
gency medical care, shelter, sanitation, water supply, and 
food poses serious risks to individual and public health; 
Whereas the United States is one of the original signatories 
of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, 
which states that ‘‘recognition of the inherent dignity and 
of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the 
human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and 
peace in the world’’; 
Whereas the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states 
that, ‘‘Member States have pledged themselves to achieve, 
in cooperation with the United Nations, the promotion of 
universal respect for and observance of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms.’’; and
