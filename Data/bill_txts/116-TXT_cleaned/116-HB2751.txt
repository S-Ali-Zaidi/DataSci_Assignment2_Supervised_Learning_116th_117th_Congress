SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) According to the Centers for Disease Con-
7
trol and Prevention, the maternal mortality rate var-
8
ies drastically for women by race and ethnicity. On

average, there are 12.7 deaths per 100,000 live 
1
births for White women, 43.5 deaths per 100,000 
2
live births for African-American women, 32.5 deaths 
3
for American Indian and Alaskan Native women, 
4
and 14.4 deaths per 100,000 live births for women 
5
of other ethnicities. While maternal mortality dispar-
6
ately impacts African-American women and indige-
7
nous women, this urgent public health crisis tra-
8
verses race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, edu-
9
cational background, and geography. 
10
(2) United States maternal mortality rates are 
11
the highest in the developed world and are increas-
12
ing rapidly. 
13
(3) Many of these maternal deaths are likely 
14
preventable. 
15
(4) According to the National Institutes of 
16
Health, doula-assisted mothers are four times less 
17
likely to have a low-birth-weight baby, two times less 
18
likely to experience a birth complication involving 
19
themselves or their baby, and significantly more like-
20
ly to initiate breastfeeding. 
21
(5) Midwife-led care is associated with cost sav-
22
ings, decreased rates of intervention, lower cesarean 
23
rates, lower preterm birth rates, and healthier out-
24
comes for mothers and babies.
