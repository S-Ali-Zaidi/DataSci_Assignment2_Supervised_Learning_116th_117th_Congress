Whereas the United States is the only United Nations mem-
ber state which has not ratified the UNCRC; 
Whereas the United States has demonstrated its commitment 
to the aims of the UNCRC by ratifying two of its op-
tional protocols, including the Optional Protocol on the 
Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict and the Op-
tional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitu-
tion, and Child Pornography; 
Whereas protecting the rights of children, preventing their 
exploitation and abuse, meeting their basic needs, and 
helping them reach their full potential are foundational 
to the development of a healthy society; 
Whereas girls face disproportionate and differential human 
rights violations and discrimination, including gender- 
based and sexual violence, sexual harassment, trafficking, 
early and forced marriage, and unequal access to edu-
cation, health, food, and justice; and 
Whereas alleviating child poverty and eliminating violence 
and discrimination against children is essential to United 
States interests at home and abroad: Now, therefore, be 
it
