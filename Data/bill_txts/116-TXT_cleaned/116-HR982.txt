RESOLUTION 
Designating May 28, 2020, as the first annual ‘‘National 
Food Allergy Prevention Awareness Day’’ to raise aware-
ness and encourage the prevention of severe food aller-
gies among children. 
Whereas 32 million Americans live with food allergies, includ-
ing many that are life-threatening, and the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention reports that the preva-
lence of food allergies in children increased by 50 percent 
between 1997 and 2011; 
Whereas food allergies have an enormous impact on quality 
of life for the 1 in 13 children who develops a severe food 
allergy, and one-third of children over the age of 5 with 
allergies are bullied for their allergy;

Whereas there is an annual cost to families in the United 
States of nearly $25 billion per year, not including the 
impact to quality of life; 
Whereas many children who develop a food allergy do not 
have a family history of food allergies, and therefore the 
family is much less aware of the life-changing con-
sequences of developing a food allergy and the need for 
food allergy prevention; 
Whereas research has shown that early introduction has 
shown promise in reducing the impact of food allergies in 
studies where parents feed peanuts and eggs, allergenic 
foods, to their babies as early as 4 to 6 months of age; 
and 
Whereas medical guidelines from the American Academy of 
Pediatrics and the National Institute of Allergy and In-
fectious Diseases recommend early peanut introduction 
with different approaches depending on the child’s risk 
category of developing an allergy: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
