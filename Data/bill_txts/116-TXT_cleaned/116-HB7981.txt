•HR 7981 IH
(1) The leadership of the People’s Republic of 
1
China has gone unchallenged in its perverse pursuits 
2
of human rights abuses across decades, including— 
3
(A) murdering untold numbers of pro-De-
4
mocracy protestors at Tiananmen Square in 
5
1988; 
6
(B) harvesting the organs of up to thou-
7
sands of Chinese citizens every year, especially 
8
targeting Falun Gong practitioners; 
9
(C) imprisoning between 800,000 and 
10
2,000,000 Uighers and ethnic Kazaks in ‘‘re- 
11
education’’ camps since April 2017; 
12
(D) condoning and facilitating the practice 
13
of forced abortions, sterilization procedures, 
14
and other forms of sexual abuse on women im-
15
prisoned in these camps; 
16
(E) arresting and silencing whistleblowers 
17
following the outbreak of the SARS–CoV–2 
18
virus; and 
19
(F) using the People’s Armed Forces Mari-
20
time Militia (PAFMM) and other paramilitary 
21
forces to constantly infringe upon the sov-
22
ereignty of surrounding countries, including in 
23
April 2020, when a Chinese maritime surveil-

lance vessel sank a Vietnamese fishing boat off 
1
the Paracel Islands. 
2
(2) Such blatant disregard for basic human de-
3
cency run contrary to the well-functioning of an 
4
open and civilized society. 
5
(3) Ultimate responsibility for these outrages 
6
must lie with the head of state of the People’s Re-
7
public of China. 
8
(4) The title of ‘‘President’’ has often been uti-
9
lized to describe the office of the head of state of the 
10
People’s Republic of China, in both the United 
11
States Government and private publications. 
12
(5) Addressing the head of state of the People’s 
13
Republic of China as a ‘‘President’’ grants the incor-
14
rect assumption that the people of the state, via 
15
democratic means, have readily legitimized the lead-
16
er who rules them. 
17
(6) The head of state of the People’s Republic 
18
of China derives all power and authority from the 
19
Chinese Communist Party, and is accountable only 
20
to them. 
21
(7) The House of Representatives has based the 
22
proposed action described in this resolution on the 
23
recommendations provided by the 2019 report of the

5
horrific human rights abuses being perpetuated and 
6
enabled by the leadership of the Chinese Communist 
7

(2) urge all countries to do the same; 
9
(3) recognize the deep friendship between the 
10
United States and the citizens of the People’s Re-
11
public of China—the first victims of their govern-
12
ment’s cruelty; and 
13
(4) honor the memory of all those who have 
14
died as a result of the callous rule of the Chinese 
15
Communist Party.
