A BILL 
To amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act 
of 1965 by establishing a program to support the mod-
ernization, renovation, or repair of career and technical 
education facilities, to enable schools serving grades 6 
through 12 that are located in rural areas or that serve 
Native American students to remodel or build new facili-
ties to provide STEM classrooms and laboratories and 
support high-speed internet, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Inspiring New STEM 
2
Professionals by Investing in Renovation of Education 
3
Spaces Act’’ or the ‘‘INSPIRES Act’’. 
4
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
5
Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) Technological advancement has increased 
7
the types of jobs available now and for the foresee-
8
able future. Over the next 10 years, employers will 
9
be looking to fill an estimated 2,600,000 openings 
10
for the top 10 occupations in the collective fields of 
11
science, technology, engineering, and mathematics 
12
(referred to in this section as ‘‘STEM’’). STEM jobs 
13
pay well; STEM workers earn an average of $14,000 
14
per year more than non-STEM workers at every 
15
education level. However, projections suggest that 
16
the United States won’t have enough skilled workers 
17
to fill STEM jobs. 
18
(2) STEM skills and knowledge are now re-
19
quired in a wide range of occupations, including 
20
many that are not traditionally considered to be 
21
science or engineering-related, such as sustainable 
22
agriculture, management of natural resources, and 
23
health care. Because of the growing use of STEM 
24
skills across all job sectors, the distinction between 
25
a ‘‘rural’’ as compared to an ‘‘urban’’ job is blur-
26
01:53 Mar 07, 2020

•HR 6109 IH
ring. For instance, renewable energy development 
1
and bio-based product manufacturing employ work-
2
ers in a variety of areas of the United States. 
3
Known as the ‘‘new collar’’ economy, the phe-
4
nomenal growth in job opportunities for those who 
5
are prepared will also support the growth of commu-
6
nities: places to raise families and invest in the fu-
7
ture. 
8
(3) While students at all grade levels can ben-
9
efit from STEM education, the evidence points to 
10
ensuring quality STEM education for middle school 
11
students during school and non-school hours. Good 
12
STEM experiences in middle school will lead to posi-
13
tive attitudes toward and expectations of STEM ex-
14
periences in high school. In the middle grades, stu-
15
dents begin to demonstrate formal logical operations 
16
(critical thinking). Further, middle school students 
17
have been shown to be highly susceptible to devel-
18
oping opinions about their competence and interest 
19
in STEM learning. Providing students with addi-
20
tional time in after school and summer STEM pro-
21
grams allows students opportunities to engage in 
22
hands-on learning that sparks interest in STEM 
23
fields and careers. Students who engage in well-de-
24
signed laboratory experiences develop problem-solv-
25

•HR 6109 IH
ing and critical-thinking skills, and gain exposure to 
1
reactions, materials, and equipment in a lab setting. 
2
Sustained investments in hands-on experiences help 
3
inspire students to further their education and pre-
4
pare them for high-technology careers by fostering 
5
skills sought by potential employers. Hands-on expe-
6
riences significantly advance learning at all levels of 
7
science education when appropriately designed and 
8
guided by qualified educators, in a safe learning en-
9
vironment that is student-centered and curriculum- 
10
driven. The classroom should contain enough re-
11
sources, space, and storage to permit long-term mul-
12
tidisciplinary projects, individual and small-group 
13
learning, inquiry and project-based learning. 
14
(4) Native American communities, including 
15
American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawai-
16
ian populations, have a long history of discrimina-
17
tion and poverty and have higher high school drop- 
18
out rates than other underserved groups. In assess-
19
ments of mathematics and reading throughout ele-
20
mentary and secondary school grades, American In-
21
dian and Alaska Native children score lower in 
22
mathematics and reading proficiency as compared to 
23
other groups. Only 28 percent of Native Hawaiian 
24
students in Hawaii demonstrate mathematics pro-
25
01:53 Mar 07, 2020

•HR 6109 IH
ficiency as compared with 49 percent of non-Native 
1
Hawaiian students. In reading, 34.8 percent of Na-
2
tive Hawaiian students tested proficient compared to 
3
54.3 percent of non-Native Hawaiian students. Fur-
4
ther, the United States is obligated under the Fed-
5
eral trust responsibility to help raise the standard of 
6
living and educational achievement of Native Ameri-
7
cans to a level comparable to non-Natives. 
8
(5) To meet the challenge of educating youth to 
9
fulfill the demand for STEM workers, public schools 
10
in the United States must be equipped to educate all 
11
youth in STEM skills, especially youth who are un-
12
derserved or socially disadvantaged. 
13
(6) The median age of United States schools is 
14
65 years. Nearly 50 percent of school buildings in 
15
the United States need significant repairs or up-
16
grades, including clean and safe classrooms and lab-
17
oratory 
spaces, 
up-to-date 
technology, 
and 
18
broadband. Moreover, the condition of school facili-
19
ties has a measurable effect on student achievement. 
20
(7) For all of these reasons, the future work-
21
force of the United States needs safe, clean, well- 
22
equipped school facilities where, regardless of his-
23
toric or current disadvantages, students can reach 
24
their full potential and learn the knowledge and
