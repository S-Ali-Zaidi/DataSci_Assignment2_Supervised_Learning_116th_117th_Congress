(1) Billie Jean King, born Billie Jean Moffit, 
1
on November 22, 1943, in Long Beach, California, 
2
was the first child of Betty (ne´e Jerman) and Bill 
3
Moffitt. 
4
(2) Billie Jean demonstrated athletic prowess 
5
from a young age. She was introduced to tennis at 
6
the age of 11, and soon after, Billie Jean purchased 
7
her first tennis racket using money she earned work-
8
ing various jobs in her neighborhood. 
9
(3) After becoming involved with tennis, Billie 
10
Jean observed inequities within the sport and real-
11
ized she could use tennis as a platform—if she be-
12
came number one. From then on, Billie Jean was 
13
determined to become a top athlete in her sport. 
14
(4) Billie Jean broke numerous barriers to be-
15
come a number one professional tennis player. She 
16
dominated women’s tennis with 39 Grand Slam sin-
17
gles, doubles, and mixed doubles titles, including a 
18
record 20 championships at Wimbledon. She also 
19
was a member of three World TeamTennis cham-
20
pionship teams. 
21
(5) After growing in prominence, Billie Jean 
22
used her platform as a celebrity to fight for equal 
23
rights and opportunities for equality for all genders 
24
in sports—and society—in the United States.

(6) Billie Jean played an instrumental role in 
1
the passage of Title IX, a law that mandates equal 
2
funding for women’s and men’s sports programs in 
3
schools and colleges. This legislation has unlocked a 
4
world of opportunities for girls and women in edu-
5
cation and sports. 
6
(7) During Billie Jean’s career, the pay dif-
7
ference between prize money for men and women in 
8
tennis continued to expand. By the early 1970s, the 
9
pay gap in prize money reached ratios of as much 
10
as 12 to one. Fewer and fewer tournaments were 
11
hosting women’s events. Realizing that she would 
12
not have support from mainstream tennis organiza-
13
tions, Billie Jean harnessed the energy of the wom-
14
en’s rights movement to create a women’s tennis 
15
tour that would elevate women’s tennis and establish 
16
pay equity within the sport. Along with eight other 
17
women tennis players, Billie Jean risked it all and 
18
formed an independent women’s professional tennis 
19
circuit, the Virginia Slims Tournament, and a play-
20
er’s union that would help achieve greater equality 
21
in prize money and recognition for women in sports. 
22
(8) In 1971, Billie Jean became the first 
23
woman in sports history to make $100,000 in earn-
24
ings in a single year.

(9) In 1972, Billie Jean was also the first ten-
1
nis player to be named Sports Illustrated’s Sports-
2
person of the Year and the first woman to receive 
3
the honor. 
4
(10) Billie Jean founded the Women’s Tennis 
5
Association, a successor to the Virginia Slims Series, 
6
and today’s principal governing body for women’s 
7
professional tennis. 
8
(11) Billie Jean helped found womenSports 
9
magazine and founded the Women’s Sports Founda-
10
tion. Both have been at the forefront of advancing 
11
women’s voice in sports. 
12
(12) In 1973, Billie Jean played a tennis match 
13
against Bobby Riggs, a top-ranked player through 
14
the 1940s who sought to undermine the credibility 
15
and prominence of women in sports. Billie Jean de-
16
feated Riggs in what became a firm declaration of 
17
women’s role in sports and society. 
18
(13) Billie Jean was one of the first women 
19
athletes to identify as lesbian, and has courageously 
20
challenged negative stereotypes and championed the 
21
visibility and inclusion of the LGBTQ community. 
22
(14) Billie Jean King was named one of the 
23
‘‘100 Most Important Americans of the 20th Cen-
24
tury’’ by LIFE magazine.

10
