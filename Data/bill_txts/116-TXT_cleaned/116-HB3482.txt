To amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to waive 
certain requirements for naturalization for American Sa-
moan United States nationals to become United States 
citizens, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. WAIVER OF CERTAIN NATURALIZATION RE-
3
QUIREMENTS 
FOR 
AMERICAN 
SAMOAN 
4
UNITED STATES NATIONALS TO BECOME 
5
UNITED STATES CITIZENS.

(a) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds the following:

•HR 3482 IH
(1) Under the Immigration and Nationality 
1
Act, persons born in the United States territory of 
2
American Samoa are nationals of the United States, 
3
but not citizens, at birth. 
4
(2) The term ‘‘national of the United States’’ 
5
is defined under the Immigration and Nationality 
6
Act to include persons who, though not citizens of 
7
the United States, owe permanent allegiance to the 
8
United States. 
9
(3) A large number of American Samoans who 
10
are United States nationals have joined the United 
11
States Armed Forces and fought for the United 
12
States. 
13
(4) However, in order for American Samoans 
14
who are United States nationals to become United 
15
States citizens, they must follow the same procedure 
16
as aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence. 
17
This procedure requires, among other steps, an ap-
18
plication, fingerprinting, an interview, an English 
19
language and civics examination, and participation 
20
in an oath ceremony. The procedure may take years 
21
to complete. 
22
(5) Given that American Samoa’s education 
23
system is structured to closely resemble that of pub-
24
lic schools in the United States, that courses on 
25

•HR 3482 IH
United States history, civics, and government are 
1
thoroughly taught, that English is the language of 
2
public school instruction, and that United States na-
3
tionals by definition owe permanent allegiance to the 
4
United States, it is in the national interest that 
5
United States nationals be allowed to become United 
6
States citizens by more expeditious means.

8
AMERICAN SAMOA.—Section 325 of the Immigration and
