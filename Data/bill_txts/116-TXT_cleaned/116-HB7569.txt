To temporarily suspend certain immigration enforcement 
activities during disease-related emergencies. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Immigration Enforce-
4
ment Moratorium Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
6
It is the sense of Congress that— 
7
(1) during the COVID–19 pandemic, many im-
8
migration enforcement activities have needlessly en-

•HR 7569 IH
dangered public health, including the health of en-
1
forcement officers and members of the community; 
2
(2) continued arrests and apprehensions— 
3
(A) prevent immigrant communities from 
4
accessing necessary services for their health and 
5
well being; and 
6
(B) risk increasing the immigration deten-
7
tion population at a time when the number of 
8
people in immigration detention must urgently 
9
be reduced; 
10
(3) Department of Homeland Security medical 
11
experts estimate that between 75 and 100 percent of 
12
the people detained in many immigration detention 
13
centers across the country may contract COVID–19 
14
unless such centers are drastically depopulated; 
15
(4) other in-person activities, including check- 
16
ins and removal hearings, create significant public 
17
health risks; 
18
(5) the National Association of Immigration 
19
Judges, a union of U.S. Immigration and Customs 
20
Enforcement trial attorneys, and the American Im-
21
migration Lawyers Association have all urged the 
22
Department of Justice to cease all in-person removal 
23
proceedings, citing expert guidance that continuing 
24

•HR 7569 IH
in-person removal proceedings during the pandemic 
1
is ‘‘irresponsible’’; 
2
(6) deportations risk spreading COVID–19 to 
3
neighboring countries, where the virus will devastate 
4
already limited health systems and create untold 
5
harm; 
6
(7) the United States has already sent individ-
7
uals who tested positive for COVID–19 to at least 
8
8 countries; 
9
(8) a consortium of United Nations migration 
10
and human rights organizations has called on all 
11
countries in the global community to halt all forced 
12
removals during the pandemic, noting that ‘‘[f]orced 
13
returns can intensify serious public health risks for 
14
everyone—migrants, public health officials, health 
15
workers, social workers, and both host and origin 
16
communities’’; 
17
(9) expulsions at the border— 
18
(A) violate longstanding, congressionally 
19
mandated protections for asylum seekers; and 
20
(B) fail to protect public health; 
21
(10) the Office of the United Nations High 
22
Commissioner for Refugees has declared that— 
23

•HR 7569 IH
(A) 
countries 
cannot 
enact 
‘‘blanket 
1
measure[s] to preclude the admission of refu-
2
gees or asylum-seekers’’; and 
3
(B) any such ‘‘measures must be non-dis-
4
criminatory as well as necessary, proportionate 
5
and reasonable to the aim of protecting public 
6
health’’; 
7
(11) leading public health experts have urged 
8
United States officials to withdraw the order ena-
9
bling mass expulsion of asylum seekers, noting bor-
10
der expulsions fail to further public health and im-
11
plicate serious human rights concerns; 
12
(12) border crossing prosecutions have been 
13
suspended in several border districts because they 
14
are incompatible with public health; 
15
(13) the Department of Homeland Security 
16
continues to refer people for prosecutions in some 
17
districts for violations of section 276 of the Immi-
18
gration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1326); and 
19
(14) people continue to be unnecessarily held in 
20
pre-trial detention facilities where COVID–19 has 
21
spread.
