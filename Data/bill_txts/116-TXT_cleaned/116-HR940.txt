Whereas the observance of the Muslim holy month of Rama-
dan commences at dusk on April 23, 2020, and continues 
for one lunar month; 
Whereas one of the purposes of fasting during the holy 
month of Ramadan is for Muslims to gain a better un-
derstanding of the plight faced by those who are less for-
tunate; 
Whereas Muslims contribute greatly to charitable organiza-
tions that help people from all faiths in the United States 
and around the world by providing medical assistance, 
family services, scholastic supplies, before- and after- 
school programs, feeding the hungry, and providing recu-
peration efforts following natural disasters; 
Whereas Thomas Jefferson was the first President to host an 
iftar, the meal breaking fast during Ramadan, at the 
White House in 1805, and every President since 1996 
has hosted an iftar for members of the community during 
their Presidencies; 
Whereas the Department of State and United States Agency 
for International Development have hosted iftars through 
the years for staff and members of the diplomatic com-
munity; 
Whereas the Department of Agriculture has hosted iftar din-
ners since 2008 to recognize and welcome interfaith dia-
logue and collaboration with individuals and organiza-
tions whose core values often overlap significantly with 
the mission of the Department, including disaster recov-
ery, reducing food waste, ensuring access to nutritious 
food, and fostering safe, prosperous, and thriving commu-
nities;

Whereas the Pentagon has held an iftar dinner every year 
since 1999, recognizing the thousands of American Mus-
lims serving in all branches of the United States military; 
Whereas over 4,500 Muslims serve on active duty, and over 
2,300 Muslims serve as selected reserve personnel in the 
United States Armed Forces; 
Whereas this Ramadan, most Muslims around the world are 
making every effort to support self-quarantine and phys-
ical distancing due to the COVID–19 pandemic as ad-
vised by local, regional, State, and national public health 
or government authorities; 
Whereas American houses of faith, community centers, 
schools, and other public centers have made a great sac-
rifice in suspending all nonessential gatherings until fur-
ther notice, including services for major religious events 
such as Ramadan, Passover, and Easter; and 
Whereas Muslims, like other faith communities, during these 
trying times are finding new ways to bridge the gap of 
physical distancing by celebrating their faith and Rama-
dan online through virtual congregational sermons and 
community events: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That—
