A BILL 
To promote the adoption of a binding Global Migration 
Agreement, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Global Migration 
4
Agreement Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) According to the United Nations High Com-
8
missioner on Refugees, there are more than 70 mil-
9

lion displaced people worldwide, which is the highest 
1
figure in recorded history. 
2
(2) Among those displaced people are approxi-
3
mately 41 million internally displaced people (IDPs), 
4
approximately 26 million refugees, and another 3.5 
5
million asylum seekers. 
6
(3) In addition, there are entire classes of vul-
7
nerable migrants who are not accounted for by tradi-
8
tional definitions of refugees, IDPs, and asylum 
9
seekers, including people forced to flee a broader set 
10
of factors, including generational poverty, climate 
11
change, or some combination of these factors. 
12
(4) As a consequence of the insufficient cat-
13
egorizations of vulnerable migrants in domestic and 
14
international laws and norms, the actual number of 
15
forced migrants is not known and has not been 
16
tracked. 
17
(5) According to the Internal Displacement 
18
Monitoring Center, more than 60 percent of the in-
19
ternal displacements in the world in 2017 resulted 
20
from disasters as opposed to conflict. 
21
(6) In 2018, the World Bank estimated that 
22
Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, and Southeast 
23
Asia will generate 143 million more climate migrants 
24
by 2050.

(7) The gender, sex, gender identity, and sexual 
1
orientation of migrants shape every stage of the mi-
2
gration process. Women and members of the 
3
LGBTQIA+ community are disproportionately vul-
4
nerable to— 
5
(A) gender-based violence and impunity for 
6
gender-based violence that serve as root causes 
7
of migration; 
8
(B) legal discrimination that serves as a 
9
root cause for forced migration; 
10
(C) gender-based and sexual violence dur-
11
ing migration; 
12
(D) human trafficking during migration; 
13
(E) the denial of the right to health as a 
14
root cause of forced migration, during migra-
15
tion, and upon arrival; 
16
(F) the denial of the right to work and to 
17
education as a root cause of forced migration, 
18
during migration, and upon arrival; and 
19
(G) the denial of other human rights as 
20
root causes of forced migration, during migra-
21
tion, and upon arrival. 
22
(8) Identifying the trigger for a given migrant 
23
often does not adequately explain the root causes.

•HR 5878 IH
Root causes of forced migration are often complex 
1
and multifaceted, and may include— 
2
(A) human rights violations; 
3
(B) systematic impunity and corruption; 
4
(C) climate change; 
5
(D) widespread community violence; 
6
(E) gender-based violence; and 
7
(F) institutional discrimination. 
8
(9) Migrants are particularly vulnerable to— 
9
(A) human trafficking; 
10
(B) violence and extortion from organized 
11
crime; 
12
(C) violations of the rights to health, edu-
13
cation, and work; and 
14
(D) violations of the particular human 
15
rights of women, the LGBTQIA+ community, 
16
racial minorities, ethnic minorities, indigenous 
17
people, religious minorities, and other vulner-
18
able populations. 
19
(10) Migrants who have arrived in either a host 
20
country or, in the case of those internally displaced, 
21
a host city or community, are particularly vulnerable 
22
to— 
23
(A) violations of the right to due process; 
24

(B) the rights to health, education, and

work; and 
2
(C) violations of the particular human 
3
rights of women, the LGBTQIA+ community, 
4
racial minorities, ethnic minorities, indigenous 
5
people, religious minorities, and other vulner-
6
able populations. 
7
(11) In the case of internal displacement, there 
8
are inadequate resources for the cities, communities, 
9
and other localities that take on a disproportionate 
10
burden of forced migration. 
11
(12) In the case of cross-border migration, 
12
there are inadequate resources for the countries that 
13
take on a disproportionate burden of forced migra-
14
tion. 
15
(13) On September 19, 2016, the United Na-
16
tions General Assembly unanimously adopted the 
17
New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants. 
18
(14) Among the provisions of the New York 
19
Declaration for Refugees and Migrants was a com-
20
mitment to the creation of a Global Compact for 
21
Safe, Orderly, and Regular Migration. 
22
(15) On December 19, 2018, the United Na-
23
tions General Assembly adopted the Global Compact 
24
for Migration that emerged from a two-year process, 
25

with 152 countries voting in favor, 12 abstaining, 24 
1
not voting, and 5 voting against. 
2
(16) The United States was among the coun-
3
tries that voted against the Global Migration Com-
4
pact, issuing a statement that said the Compact was 
5
‘‘an effort by the United Nations to advance global 
6
governance at the expense of the sovereign right of 
7
States’’. 
8
(17) The United States has demonstrated its 
9
commitment to maintaining its historic leadership in 
10
the field of global migration by remaining the top 
11
funder of the United Nations High Commission on 
12
Refugees and the International Organization for Mi-
13
gration. 
14
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
15
It is the sense of Congress that— 
16
(1) the leadership of the United States is para-
17
mount to addressing the global forced displacement 
18
crisis; 
19
(2) in order for the United States to restore its 
20
global leadership on the issue of migration, it must 
21
reaffirm its commitments in both the domestic and 
22
international arena, including by restoring refugee 
23
resettlement to adequate levels, affirming and codi-
24
fying the rights of asylum seekers, and adequately

funding the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and 
1
Migration of the Department of State; 
2
(3) as a first step in taking leadership on the 
3
issue of global migration, the United States should 
4
sign the existing Global Compact for Migration; 
5
(4) as an additional measure to restore Amer-
6
ican leadership on global migration issues, the 
7
United States should work in bilateral and multilat-
8
eral relationships with North American, Central 
9
American, and Caribbean Governments to develop a 
10
regional migration agreement rooted in the prin-
11
ciples outlined in the Global Compact for Migration 
12
to be used as a model for the Agreement required 
13
by section 4 of this Act; 
14
(5) the effects of climate change on displace-
15
ment, including both displacement from ‘‘sudden 
16
onset’’ natural disasters as well as the increasing 
17
scarcity of resources, represent an urgent concern 
18
for the United States; 
19
(6) countries with less capacity but greater 
20
proximity to countries of origin for refugees and asy-
21
lum seekers, such as Lebanon, Jordan, Niger, and 
22
Colombia, have taken on a disproportionate burden 
23
of the global forced displacement crisis; and 
24
22:52 Feb 19, 2020

•HR 5878 IH
(7) a global migration system with substantial 
1
multilateral buy-in is necessary to adequately ad-
2
dress the increasing levels of forced migration, and 
3
significant institution-building is needed in order to 
4
provide adequate protection for migrants at risk.
