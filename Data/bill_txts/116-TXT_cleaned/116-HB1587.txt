SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Marijuana Data Col-
2
lection Act’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) Nearly two-thirds of Americans—about 68 
6
percent—favor marijuana legalization. 
7
(2) A total of 33 States, the District of Colum-
8
bia, Puerto Rico, and Guam have legalized mari-
9
juana for medicinal use, and of those, 10 States and 
10
the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana 
11
for adult non-medicinal use. 
12
(3) Despite State legalization, marijuana re-
13
mains illegal under Federal law, listed in schedule I 
14
under the Controlled Substances Act. 
15
(4) Every day, more Americans die from over-
16
dosing on opioids. In 2016, the Centers for Disease 
17
Control and Prevention estimated that more than 
18
42,000 Americans died from opioid-related drug 
19
overdoses. President Trump has, on two separate oc-
20
casions, declared the opioid crisis as a public health 
21
emergency. 
22
(5) Studies suggest that increased access to 
23
marijuana is associated with reductions in opioid 
24
abuse and opioid-related deaths, among other eco-
25
nomic and social benefits:

•HR 1587 IH
(A) A study published in the Journal of 
1
the American Medical Association (JAMA) in 
2
2014 that compared mortality rates between 
3
States that legalized medical marijuana versus 
4
States that have not legalized medical mari-
5
juana found that States that had legalized med-
6
ical marijuana had, on average, 20 percent 
7
fewer opioid-related overdose deaths in the first 
8
year of legalization compared to States that had 
9
not legalized marijuana. This difference wid-
10
ened in subsequent years after legalization. 
11
(B) A study published in the American 
12
Journal of Public Health in 2017 found that 
13
opioid-related deaths tended to decline after the 
14
legalization of non-medicinal marijuana for 
15
adults in the State of Colorado. This study esti-
16
mated a 6.5-percent reduction in opioid-related 
17
deaths compared to pre-legalization. 
18
(6) Due to marijuana legalization, States have 
19
generated millions in taxes and revenue and have al-
20
located these funds into public health, education, 
21
economic development, restorative justice, and job 
22
creation, such as— 
23
(A) substance use disorder treatment and 
24
drug use prevention programs;

(E) basic health plans; 
5
(F) community residential centers; 
6
(G) youth drug use prevention; 
7
(H) jail diversion; 
8
(I) mental health treatment; and 
9
(J) job creation and placement. 
10
(7) A robust and properly regulated marijuana 
11
industry wherein States are allowed to operate mari-
12
juana programs free from Federal interference 
13
stands to benefit States’ public health, education, 
14
economic, and law enforcement and judicial sectors.
