A BILL 
To prohibit the Secretary of Labor from implementing or 
enforcing the final rule on joint employer status. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Upholding Worker 
4
Protections Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds that: 
7
(1) Under the Fair Labor Standards Act 
8
(FLSA), an employee can have joint employers who 
9
are both responsible, individually and jointly, for 
10

•HR 6245 IH
complying with the law’s minimum wage, overtime, 
1
and child labor requirements. 
2
(2) In adopting the FLSA, Congress estab-
3
lished a broad definition of ‘‘employ’’ to include ‘‘to 
4
suffer or permit to work’’. In using this definition, 
5
Congress rejected the narrower common law stand-
6
ard of employment, which turns on the degree to 
7
which the employer has control over an employee. 
8
(3) As the Supreme Court noted in United 
9
States v. Rosenwasser, the FLSA’s definition of em-
10
ployment is the ‘‘broadest definition that has ever 
11
been included in any one act’’. The breadth of the 
12
FLSA’s employment standard was necessary to ac-
13
complish its goal of eliminating substandard labor 
14
conditions. 
15
(4) For decades, the Supreme Court and the 
16
Circuit 
Courts 
of 
Appeals 
have 
effectuated 
17
Congress’s intent to broadly define employment, and 
18
thus joint employment, under the FLSA by applying 
19
an economic realities test to determine whether the 
20
employee is economically dependent on the potential 
21
joint employer. 
22
(5) On January 16, 2020, the Labor Depart-
23
ment published an interpretive regulation that seeks 
24

•HR 6245 IH
to significantly limit joint employment liability under 
1
the FLSA. 
2
(6) The Labor Department’s interpretation con-
3
flicts with the FLSA, congressional intent, and judi-
4
cial precedent by narrowly restricting joint employ-
5
ment to a question of control and rejecting the eco-
6
nomic dependence inquiry. 
7
(7) In recent decades, many employers have in-
8
creasingly moved away from the direct hiring of em-
9
ployees and instead engaged subcontracted workers, 
10
temporary workers, and used franchisees, creating a 
11
‘‘fissuring’’ of the workplace. Workers in the fis-
12
sured workplace often have lower pay and limited 
13
benefits, exacerbating income inequality. 
14
(8) As an interpretive regulation, this rule does 
15
not have the force of law, but will dictate how and 
16
if the Department will continue to hold employers 
17
accountable when they are jointly liable for FLSA 
18
violations. 
19
(9) The Labor Department’s flawed interpretive 
20
rule could increase wage theft and workplace fis-
21
suring by incentivizing employers to outsource work 
22
to labor intermediaries and subcontractors to avoid 
23
FLSA liability. Increased use of labor intermediaries 
24
or subcontractors that are prone to inadequate 
25

FLSA compliance would leave workers vulnerable to 
1
wage theft. If such entities are thinly capitalized, 
2
workers may be unable to recover any back pay 
3
owed. 
4
(10) According the Economic Policy Institute, 
5
increased wage theft and workplace fissuring under 
6
this interpretive rule could cost workers more than 
7
a billion dollars each year.

SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON IMPLEMENTING OR ENFORCING 
9
FINAL RULE ON JOINT EMPLOYER STATUS. 
10
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Sec-
11
retary of Labor may not implement or enforce the final 
12
rule on ‘‘Joint Employer Status under the Fair Labor 
13
Standards Act’’ published by the Department of Labor in 
14
the Federal Register on January 16, 2020 (85 Fed. Reg. 
15
2820 et seq.).
