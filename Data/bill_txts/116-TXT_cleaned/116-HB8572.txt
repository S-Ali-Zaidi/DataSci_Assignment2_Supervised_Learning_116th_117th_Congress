1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
The Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (42 
3
U.S.C. 10101 et seq.) dictated that the Federal Gov-
4
ernment would identify repositories and begin dis-
5
posal of high-level radioactive waste and spent nu-
6
clear fuel beginning not later than January 31, 
7
1998. 
8
(2) It has been 60 years since the first civilian 
9
nuclear power reactor became operational, and the 
10
United States still lacks a long-term management 
11
solution for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and 
12
high-level radioactive waste. 
13
(3) There are approximately 100 sites across at 
14
least 34 States where spent nuclear fuel and high- 
15
level radioactive waste is currently stored. 
16
(4) The need to develop a long-term nuclear 
17
waste storage plan for the United States is well rec-
18
ognized by many experts, institutions, and organiza-
19
tions, including the Department of Energy and the 
20
Nuclear Energy Institute. 
21
(5) With the future of the repository at the 
22
Yucca Mountain site in doubt, providing interim 
23
storage for spent nuclear fuel currently in repose at 
24
sites of both decommissioned and active civilian nu-
25
clear power reactors has become an imperative.

(6) The purpose of a consolidated interim stor-
1
age facility is to begin the process of accepting spent 
2
nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste, while 
3
also developing and perfecting protocols and proce-
4
dures for transportation and storage of such spent 
5
nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste. 
6
(7) In recent decades, Federal agencies have 
7
used auctions and other market mechanisms to re-
8
duce costs to taxpayers and allocate resources in ef-
9
ficient and transparent ways.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. 
11
In this Act: 
12
(1) CONSOLIDATED INTERIM STORAGE FACIL-
13
ITY.—The term ‘‘consolidated interim storage facil-
14
ity’’ means a facility for the consolidated storage of 
15
spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste 
16
generated by multiple persons or the Secretary of 
17
Energy pending the disposal of the spent nuclear 
18
fuel and high-level radioactive waste in a repository. 
19
(2) HIGH-LEVEL
RADIOACTIVE
WASTE.—The 
20
term ‘‘high-level radioactive waste’’ has the meaning 
21
given the term in section 2 of the Nuclear Waste 
22
Policy Act of 1982 (42 U.S.C. 10101).

1
the meaning given the term in section 2 of the Nu-
2
clear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (42 U.S.C. 10101). 
3
(4) SPENT NUCLEAR FUEL.—The term ‘‘spent 
4
nuclear fuel’’ has the meaning given the term in sec-
5
tion 2 of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (42

NUCLEAR FUEL AND HIGH-LEVEL RADIO-
9
ACTIVE WASTE. 
10
Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment 
11
of this Act, the Comptroller General of the United States 
12
shall submit to Congress a report on the risks to current 
13
storage locations for spent nuclear fuel, including spent 
14
nuclear fuel from civilian nuclear power reactors, and 
15
high-level radioactive waste, including— 
16
(1) risks that are related to global weather pat-
17
terns and geography, including— 
18
(A) extreme weather events (including hur-
19
ricanes, tornadoes, and other storms), fires, 
20
drought, flooding (whether or not the spent nu-
21
clear fuel is located in a floodplain); and 
22
(B) earthquakes and proximity to fault
