SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress makes the following findings: 
2
(1) Women in the United States and around 
3
the world are the linchpin of families and commu-
4
nities and are often the first to feel the immediate 
5
and adverse effects of social, environmental, and eco-
6
nomic stresses on their families and communities. 
7
(2) The United Nations has recognized, as one 
8
of the central organizing principles for its work, that 
9
‘‘no enduring solution to society’s most threatening 
10
social, economic and political problems can be found 
11
without the full participation, and the full empower-
12
ment, of the world’s women’’. 
13
(3) The United Nations Development Pro-
14
gramme 2013 Human Development Report has 
15
found that the number of people living in extreme 
16
poverty could increase by up to 3,000,000,000 by 
17
2050 unless environmental disasters are averted by 
18
coordinated global action.

•HR 1880 IH
(4) Climate change is already forcing the most 
1
vulnerable communities and populations in devel-
2
oping countries to face unprecedented climate stress, 
3
including water scarcity and drought, as well as se-
4
vere weather events and floods, which can lead to re-
5
duced agricultural productivity, food insecurity, and 
6
increased disease. 
7
(5) Climate change exacerbates issues of scar-
8
city and lack of accessibility to primary natural re-
9
sources, forest resources, and arable land for food 
10
production, thereby contributing to increased conflict 
11
and instability, as well as the workload and stresses 
12
on women farmers, who are estimated to produce 60 
13
to 80 percent of the food in most developing coun-
14
tries. 
15
(6) Women will disproportionately face harmful 
16
impacts from climate change, particularly in poor 
17
and developing nations where women regularly as-
18
sume increased responsibility for growing the fam-
19
ily’s food and collecting water, fuel, and other re-
20
sources. 
21
(7) Epidemics, such as malaria and zika, are 
22
expected to worsen and spread due to variations in 
23
climate, putting women (especially pregnant mothers 
24
and women who hope to become pregnant) and chil-

dren without access to prevention and medical serv-
1
ices at risk. 
2
(8) The direct and indirect effects of climate 
3
change 
have 
a 
disproportionate 
impact 
on 
4
marginalized women, such as environmental refugees 
5
and displaced persons, migrants, religious, racial, or 
6
ethnic minorities, adolescent girls, lesbian and trans 
7
women, women living in poverty, and women and 
8
girls with disabilities and those who are living with 
9
HIV. 
10
(9) Conflict has a disproportionate impact on 
11
the most vulnerable communities and populations, 
12
including women, and is fueled in the poorest re-
13
gions of the world by harsher climates, leading to 
14
migration, refugee crises, and conflicts over scarce 
15
natural resources, including land and water. 
16
(10) Displaced, refugee, and stateless women 
17
and girls face extreme violence and threats, includ-
18
ing— 
19
(A) being forced to exchange sex for food 
20
and humanitarian supplies; 
21
(B) being at increased risk of rape, sexual 
22
exploitation, and abuse; and 
23

•HR 1880 IH
(C) being at increased risk for HIV, sexu-
1
ally transmitted infections (STIs), unplanned 
2
pregnancy, and poor reproductive health. 
3
(11) It is predicted that climate change will 
4
lead to increasing frequency and intensity of extreme 
5
weather conditions, precipitating the occurrence of 
6
natural disasters around the globe. 
7
(12) The relocation and death of women, and 
8
especially mothers, as a result of climate-related dis-
9
asters often has devastating impacts on social sup-
10
port networks, family ties, and the coping capacity 
11
of families and communities. 
12
(13) The ability of women to adapt to climate 
13
change is constrained by a lack of economic free-
14
doms, property and inheritance rights, and access to 
15
financial resources, education, family planning and 
16
reproductive health, and new tools, equipment, and 
17
technology. 
18
(14) Despite having a unique capacity and 
19
knowledge to promote and provide for adaptation to 
20
climate change, women often have insufficient re-
21
sources to undertake such adaptation. 
22
(15) Women are shown to have a multiplier ef-
23
fect because women use their income and resources, 
24
when given the necessary tools, to increase the well- 
25

•HR 1880 IH
being of their children and families, and thus play 
1
a critical role in reducing food insecurity, poverty, 
2
and socioeconomic effects of climate change. 
3
(16) Women are often underrepresented in the 
4
development and formulation of policy regarding 
5
mitigation and adaptation to climate change, even 
6
though women are often in the best position to pro-
7
vide and consult on adaptive strategies.
