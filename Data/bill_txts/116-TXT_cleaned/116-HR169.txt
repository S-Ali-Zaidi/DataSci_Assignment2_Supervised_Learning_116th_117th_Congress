RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives regard-
ing the need for increased diversity and inclusion in 
the tech sector, and increased access to opportunity in 
science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics 
(STEAM) education. 
Whereas there will be 1,400,000 new tech jobs by 2020, how-
ever, 70 percent of those jobs will be unfulfilled at the 
rate United States universities are currently producing 
qualified graduates; 
Whereas communities of color (African Americans, Latinos, 
Native Americans, Asian Americans, and Pacific Island-

ers) are woefully underrepresented in corporate leader-
ship roles, including the technology sector; 
Whereas African Americans, Latinos, Native Americans, and 
Pacific Islanders are disproportionately underrepresented 
in the technology sector; 
Whereas Black and Hispanic workers in the science and engi-
neering workforce continue to be underrepresented, Black 
employees represent 11 percent of the United States 
workforce but only 9 percent of the science and engineer-
ing workforce, and Hispanic employees represent 16 per-
cent of the United States workforce but only 7 percent 
of the science and engineering workforce; 
Whereas the share of women working in science and engi-
neering jobs has held steady around 50 percent since 
1990, but the share of women in specific fields has varied 
from 47 percent in life sciences to only 25 percent in 
computer science; 
Whereas women of color represent less than 10 percent of all 
computer science professionals (African American: 5.7 
percent; Hispanic: 6.4 percent; American Indian or Alas-
ka Native: 0.1 percent; and Asian: 22.9 percent); 
Whereas 50 to 70 percent of employees in tech companies 
work in non-tech positions, for which an existing pipeline 
of qualified African Americans and Latinos currently ex-
ists; 
Whereas a pipeline of qualified technical candidates is critical 
as the tech industry improves its recruiting, hiring, and 
retaining of candidates and employees of color; 
Whereas underrepresented minority students overall face an 
opportunity gap in STEAM education;

Whereas women of color particularly face an achievement gap 
in science and engineering education; 
Whereas, in 2015, women were conferred nearly a third of all 
science and engineering degrees; 
Whereas, in 2015, women of color received only 13 percent 
of all science and engineering degrees (Black: 3.2 per-
cent; Hispanic: 3.9 percent; Native American or Alaskan 
Native: 0.2 percent; Asian or Pacific Islander: 4.5 per-
cent; and multi-racial: 1.2 percent); 
Whereas women overall face a large opportunity gap in com-
puter science; 
Whereas only 18 of all bachelor’s degrees conferred in com-
puter science went to women in 2015; 
Whereas, in 2015, women of color received only 9 percent of 
degrees conferred in computer science (Black: 3 percent; 
Hispanic: 2 percent; Native American or Alaska Native: 
0.8 percent; and Asian or Pacific Islander: 3 percent); 
Whereas the opportunity and achievement gap between boys 
and girls starts early; 
Whereas, in 2017, 22 percent of high schools offered the Ad-
vanced Placement (AP) Computer Science course, and 
only 35 percent of high schools teach computer science; 
Whereas, in 2018, 28 percent of AP Computer Science test 
takers were girls, and 21 percent were African American 
or Latino; and 
Whereas there is a dearth of disaggregated data to show aca-
demic attainment across different Asian-American and 
Pacific Islander communities: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives supports
