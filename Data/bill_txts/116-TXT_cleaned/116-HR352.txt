struction industry who work year-round to ensure safe 
construction; 
Whereas building code development in the United States is 
facilitated through a partnership between private sector, 
local, State, and Federal experts in the built environ-
ment, who have created and implemented the highest 
quality codes to protect us in the buildings where we wor-
ship, live, learn, work, and play; 
Whereas these modern building codes include safeguards to 
protect the public from natural disasters such as hurri-
canes, snowstorms, tornadoes, wildfires, floods, and 
earthquakes, which, according to a FEMA-supported 
study by the National Institute of Building Sciences, pro-
vide $11 in future mitigation benefits for every dollar in-
vested; 
Whereas the International Code Council designates Building 
Safety Month each May to remind the public about the 
critical role of our State and local code officials, who as-
sure us of safe, efficient, and livable buildings that are 
essential to the country’s prosperity; 
Whereas Building Safety Month encourages all Americans to 
raise awareness of the importance of safe and resilient 
construction, fire prevention, disaster mitigation, and new 
technologies in the construction industry; and 
Whereas Building Safety Month recognizes that the imple-
mentation of safety codes by local and State agencies has 
saved lives and protected homes and businesses: Now, 
therefore, be it
