SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) There are an estimated 2,500,000 domestic 
3
workers across the United States working in the 
4
homes of people of the United States to provide 
5
home and personal care, child care, and house clean-
6
ing services. 
7
(2) Domestic work makes all other work pos-
8
sible. It is work that cannot be outsourced to work-
9
ers living outside of the United States, nor is it close 
10
to being automated. Without the millions of domes-
11
tic workers caring for children, seniors, and individ-
12
uals with disabilities, and cleaning homes, much of 
13
the economy would come to a standstill. 
14
(3) The employment of individuals in domestic 
15
service in households affects commerce as described 
16
00:19 Jul 20, 2019
H3760
4 
•HR 3760 IH
in section 2(a) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 
1
1938 (29 U.S.C. 202(a)). 
2
(4) Domestic workers are hired or contacted for 
3
work by phone, mail, or Internet, or through news-
4
paper ads, and travel to work through transpor-
5
tation on interstate highways, interstate transit, or 
6
vehicles in interstate commerce. 
7
(5) In 2016, the Bureau of Labor Statistics 
8
predicted that between 2016 and 2026— 
9
(A) the number of new jobs for home 
10
health and personal care aides will increase 41 
11
percent, which is an increase of 1,200,000 jobs 
12
and the largest increase in new jobs of any oc-
13
cupational category during such period; and 
14
(B) the number of new jobs for child care 
15
and house cleaning positions will increase 6 to 
16
7 percent. 
17
(6) Nine out of ten domestic workers are 
18
women, and such women are disproportionately peo-
19
ple of color and immigrants. Women, people of color, 
20
and immigrants have historically faced barriers to 
21
employment and economic advancement. 
22
(7) Domestic workers face low wages and unac-
23
ceptable working conditions. Data from the Bureau 
24
of Labor Statistics indicates that the average wage 
25
00:19 Jul 20, 2019
H3760
5 
•HR 3760 IH
for a domestic worker is approximately $11 per 
1
hour, or $23,000 per year if working full-time. In 
2
practice, the average wage for a domestic worker is 
3
less than such approximation given that domestic 
4
work has largely been negotiated in the informal 
5
labor market. 
6
(8) A landmark study of domestic workers pub-
7
lished in 2012 by the National Domestic Workers 
8
Alliance and the Center for Urban Economic Devel-
9
opment of the University of Illinois at Chicago Data 
10
Center titled ‘‘Home Economics: The Invisible and 
11
Unregulated World of Domestic Work’’ indicated 
12
poor working conditions across the domestic workers 
13
industry. The findings of such study included that— 
14
(A) domestic workers have little control 
15
over their working conditions, and employment 
16
is usually arranged without a written contract; 
17
(B) 35 percent of domestic workers inter-
18
viewed reported that they worked long hours 
19
without breaks in the year immediately pre-
20
ceding the interview; 
21
(C) 25 percent of live-in domestic workers 
22
had responsibilities that prevented them from 
23
getting at least 5 hours of uninterrupted sleep 
24

•HR 3760 IH
at night during the week immediately preceding 
1
the interview; and 
2
(D) 91 percent of domestic workers inter-
3
viewed who encountered problems with their 
4
working conditions in the year immediately pre-
5
ceding the interview did not complain about 
6
their working conditions because they were 
7
afraid they would lose their job. 
8
(9) The study described in paragraph (8) found 
9
that domestic workers have little access to federally 
10
supported employment benefits. For instance: 
11
(A) Less than 2 percent of such workers 
12
receive retirement or pension benefits, and less 
13
than 9 percent of such workers work for em-
14
ployers that collect payroll taxes on wages paid 
15
to such workers to provide eligibility for Social 
16
Security benefits. 
17
(B) Sixty-five percent of such workers do 
18
not have health insurance, and only 4 percent 
19
of such workers receive employer-provided in-
20
surance, despite the fact that domestic work is 
21
hazardous and often results in illness or phys-
22
ical injuries. 
23
(10) Compounding these challenges is the fact 
24
that many domestic workers have been, and in many 
25

•HR 3760 IH
cases continue to be, excluded from key provisions of 
1
labor and employment laws like the Fair Labor 
2
Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 201 et seq.), the 
3
Occupational Health and Safety Act of 1970 (29 
4
U.S.C. 651 et seq.), and the National Labor Rela-
5
tions Act (29 U.S.C. 151 et seq.). Minimum em-
6
ployee threshold rules, misclassification of domestic 
7
workers as independent contractors, and exclusion of 
8
independent contractors from coverage means that 
9
most domestic workers are also de facto excluded 
10
from Federal civil rights protections, including pro-
11
tections under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 
12
1964 (29 U.S.C. 2000e et seq.) and other laws. 
13
(11) The International Labour Organization’s 
14
Domestic Workers Convention, adopted in 2011, 
15
calls for domestic workers to have the right to free-
16
dom of association and collective actions, protections 
17
against harassment, privacy rights, and the right to 
18
be informed of conditions of employment. This Con-
19
vention also calls for the right of domestic workers 
20
to keep their travel documents, the right to overtime 
21
compensation and rest breaks, the right to minimum 
22
wage coverage, the right to occupational safety and 
23
health protections, and mechanisms to pursue com-
24
plaints and ensure compliance with the law. 
25

•HR 3760 IH
(12) The unique nature of their work, in pri-
1
vate homes with individuals and families, also often 
2
makes it difficult for domestic workers to use Fed-
3
eral programs and policies to improve their skills 
4
and training and to join together collectively to ne-
5
gotiate better pay and working conditions. 
6
(13) Many domestic workers are also vulnerable 
7
to discrimination and sexual harassment. These 
8
issues are further exacerbated by the unique working 
9
conditions faced by domestic workers, such as isola-
10
tion, poverty, immigration status, the lack of famili-
11
arity with the law and legal processes, limited net-
12
works for support, language barriers, and fear of re-
13
taliation and deportation. 
14
(14) Millions of older individuals, individuals 
15
with disabilities, and families are increasingly relying 
16
on domestic workers. By bringing domestic work out 
17
of the shadows and creating incentives and invest-
18
ments that help raise wages and standards for do-
19
mestic workers, the Federal Government can lift mil-
20
lions of the most vulnerable workers out of poverty, 
21
reduce turnover due to poor working conditions, 
22
thereby enhancing quality of care, and support the 
23
millions of working and retired people of the United 
24
States who rely on them.
