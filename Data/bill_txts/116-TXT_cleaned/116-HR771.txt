RESOLUTION 
Censuring the President of the United States. 
Whereas, in his conduct of the office of President of the 
United States—and in violation of his constitutional oath 
to faithfully execute the office of the President of the 
United States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, 
protect, and defend the Constitution of the United 
States, and in violation of his constitutional duty to take 
care that the laws be faithfully executed—Donald J. 
Trump, acting both directly and through his agents with-
in and outside the United States Government, abused the 
powers of the Presidency for his own personal political 
gain; 
Whereas President Trump, using the powers of his high of-
fice, solicited the interference of Ukraine in the 2020 
United States Presidential election;

Whereas President Trump conducted a scheme or course of 
conduct that included a recorded telephone conversation 
with President Zelensky, soliciting the Government of 
Ukraine to investigate his political rival, former Vice 
President Joseph R. Biden, Jr.; 
Whereas President Trump abused the powers of the Presi-
dency by ignoring or injuring vital national interests to 
obtain an improper personal political benefit by abusing 
his high office to undermine the integrity of the United 
States democratic process; 
Whereas President Trump has undermined America’s na-
tional security and the safety of our people with a grow-
ing list of unconstitutional and reckless actions, including 
but not limited to: 
(1) Violating the War Powers Resolution and Article 
I of the Constitution by carrying out acts of war without 
Congressional approval. 
(2) Illegally and unconstitutionally using U.S. mili-
tary forces to occupy and pillage oilfield reserves of Syria, 
a sovereign nation. 
(3) Recklessly enabling President Erdogan of Tur-
key to invade and occupy Northern Syria and conduct 
ethnic cleansing of Syrian Kurds. 
(4) Continued support for Saudi Arabia’s genocidal 
war in Yemen that has caused death, suffering, and star-
vation. 
(5) Recklessly abandoning nuclear agreements and 
treaties, like the INF treaty with Russia and the Iran 
nuclear agreement, thereby increasing the risk of nuclear 
war, nuclear proliferation, and war with Iran. 
In these and other ways, President Donald Trump has under-
mined the safety and security of the American people;
