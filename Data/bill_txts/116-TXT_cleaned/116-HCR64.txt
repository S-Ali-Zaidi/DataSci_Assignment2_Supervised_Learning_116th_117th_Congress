challenges facing the United States by educating students 
for jobs of the 21st century, expanding economic oppor-
tunity, addressing the needs of military families and a 
generation of veterans returning from war, helping com-
munities rebuild after natural disasters, supporting com-
munities combatting the opioid epidemic, and preserving 
the parks and public lands of the United States;

each year in more than 21,000 locations nationwide and,

munities being served as well as to individuals providing 
the service, including improved health, expanded eco-
nomic opportunity, and increased civic participation;

demonstrate commitment, dedication, and patriotism by 
making an intensive commitment to service and, after 
their terms of service, remain engaged in our commu-
nities as volunteers, public servants, and civic leaders at 
disproportionately high rates; and 
Whereas the Corporation for National and Community Serv-
ice has led efforts to improve lives, strengthen commu-
nities, and foster civic engagement through service and 
volunteering in the United States for the last quarter
