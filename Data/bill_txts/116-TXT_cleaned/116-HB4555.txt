•HR 4555 IH
(1) To prepare students for success in the mod-
1
ern global economy, opportunities for study abroad 
2
should be included as part of a well-rounded edu-
3
cation. 
4
(2) Study abroad programs provide students 
5
with unparalleled access to international knowledge, 
6
an unmatched opportunity to learn foreign lan-
7
guages, and a unique environment for developing 
8
cultural understanding, all of which are knowledge 
9
and skills needed in today’s global economy. 
10
(3) Less than 2 percent of all enrolled postsec-
11
ondary students in the United States study abroad 
12
for credit in any given year, and minority students, 
13
first generation college students, community college 
14
students, and students with disabilities are signifi-
15
cantly underrepresented in study abroad participa-
16
tion. 
17
(4) Congress authorized the establishment of 
18
the Commission on the Abraham Lincoln Study 
19
Abroad Fellowship Program pursuant to section 104 
20
of the Miscellaneous Appropriations and Offsets Act, 
21
2004 (division H of Public Law 108–199). Pursuant 
22

for students at institutions of higher education in 
1
the United States to study abroad, with special em-
2
phasis on studying in developing nations.

(5) According to the Lincoln Commission, 
4
‘‘[e]xperience shows that leadership from adminis-
5
trators and faculty will drive the number of study 
6
abroad participants higher and improve the quality 
7
of programs. Such leadership is the only way that 
8
study abroad will become an integral part of the un-
9
dergraduate experience.’’. A competitive grant pro-
10
gram is necessary to encourage and support such 
11
leadership. 
12
(6) Student safety while studying abroad is and 
13
must continue to be a priority for institutions of 
14
higher education and study abroad programs.
