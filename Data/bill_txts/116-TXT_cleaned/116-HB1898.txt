and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The United States has a long history of 
3
providing safe and reliable exports. Close proximity 
4
to Cuba lends itself to low transportation costs for 
5
United States goods exported to Cuba. The United 
6
States is geographically poised to be a significant 
7
trading partner in agricultural commodities. 
8
(2) Cuba imports approximately 80 percent of 
9
its food, with global agricultural exports to Cuba 
10
doubling over the past decade to $1,900,000,000. 
11
(3) In 2015, the Obama administration re-
12
versed a prior rule of the Department of the Treas-
13
ury that defined ‘‘cash in advance’’ to require that 
14
cash payments must be made before United States 
15
products leave United States ports. The new rule de-
16
fines ‘‘cash in advance’’ as ‘‘cash before transfer of 
17
title’’, facilitating more efficient trade with Cuba. 
18
(4) The Trump administration has retained this 
19
definition and stated in its National Security Presi-
20
dential Memorandum on Cuba that forthcoming reg-
21
ulatory changes shall not prohibit transactions that 
22
support the sale of agricultural commodities con-
23
sistent with the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export 
24
Enhancement Act of 2000.

(5) United States agricultural exporters are still 
1
not permitted to extend credit to Cuban buyers, in-
2
cluding ALIMPORT, a State-owned and State-con-
3
trolled entity that makes all decisions regarding 
4
United States exports to the Cuban market. As a re-
5
sult, United States agricultural exports to Cuba 
6
have declined and United States exporters face a key 
7
disadvantage relative to other exporting countries. 
8
Notably, 
rice 
exports 
fell 
from 
a 
value 
of 
9
$64,000,000 in 2004 to essentially $0 in 2009 and 
10
subsequent years. 
11
(6) Despite these restrictions, the United States 
12
has been the largest exporter of agricultural goods 
13
to Cuba over the last decade. However, the United 
14
States slipped to being the second leading exporter 
15
of agricultural goods to Cuba in 2013 and the third 
16
leading exporter of agricultural goods to Cuba in 
17
2014. For many of Cuba’s top agricultural imports, 
18
such as wheat, rice, and dairy, there have been no 
19
transactions with the United States in well over a 
20
decade. 
21
(7) While trade opportunities exist, Cuba re-
22
mains an undemocratic autocracy that oppresses its 
23
own people and restricts freedom.

(8) With these cautionary factors in mind, it is 
1
important to provide United States farmers and 
2
ranchers additional opportunities to benefit from 
3
trade with Cuba.
