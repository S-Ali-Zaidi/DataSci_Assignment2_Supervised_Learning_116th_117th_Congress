A BILL 
To amend the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets 
Act of 1968 to establish grants to reduce the incidence 
of hate crimes, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Hate Crime Victim

Assistance Act of 2019’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress makes the following findings: 
7
(1) Hate crimes have been on the rise over the 
8
previous years across the United States. In 2015, 
9

•HR 223 IH
according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation 
1
(FBI), 56.9 percent of single-bias incidents were 
2
motivated by either race, ethnicity or ancestry bias. 
3
(2) The same report mentions that 21.4 percent 
4
were prompted by religious bias; 18.1 percent sexual 
5
orientation bias; 2.0 percent gender-identity bias; 
6
and 1.3 percent disability bias. 
7
(3) Out of the 56.9 percent of the single-bias 
8
incidents that were motivated by race reported to 
9
the FBI in 2015, 9.4 percent of these were classified 
10
as anti-Hispanic or Latino, and 3.3 percent of these 
11
single bias incidents had an anti-Asian bias. 
12
(4) Previous data from the FBI suggest that 
13
hate crimes against African Americans have seen a 
14
dramatic increase over the years. Such trends can be 
15
traced back to 2003, when hate crimes against Afri-
16
can Americans were twice as much as all other race 
17
groups combined. 
18
(5) A 2015 study conducted by the Los Angeles 
19
County Commission on Human Relations notes that 
20
half of the hate crimes in Los Angeles County were 
21
racially motivated—58 percent of those attacks tar-
22
geted the County’s African-American population, al-
23
though they only constituted 4 percent of the coun-
24
ty’s population.

(6) Previous research suggests that Black males 
1
are also more vulnerable to violent victimization. 
2
Furthermore, data suggest that communities of color 
3
continue to be victims of hate crime violence. 
4
(7) The Los Angeles County Commission on 
5
Human Relations report found that the number of 
6
hate crimes targeting Asian and Pacific islanders 
7
tripled from six to eighteen since 2014. The same 
8
report notes that Anti-Latino hate crimes also rose 
9
from 36 in 2014 to 61 in 2015. 
10
(8) A study conducted by the Human Rights 
11
Campaign notes that out of the number of hate 
12
crimes committed against the transgender commu-
13
nity from 2013–2015, at least 87 percent of victims 
14
were transgender people of color. 
15
(9) Only 16, or 30 percent, were killed in 
16
States that have hate crime laws that account for 
17
crimes motivated by the victim’s gender identity; but 
18
despite these provisions and a Federal hate crime 
19
law, not a single one of these murders was pros-
20
ecuted or reported to the FBI as a hate crime. 
21
(10) The United States is currently facing a 
22
surge in religious bias. According to the Southern 
23
Poverty Law Center, there are currently 917 hate 
24
groups operating across the country.

(11) A CNN report found that in the first 
1
months of 2017 the country experienced a substan-
2
tial increase in Anti-Semitic incidents. In compari-
3
son to the same period in 2016, Anti-Semitic inci-
4
dents were 86 percent higher. 
5
(12) Historically hate crimes have gone under 
6
reported. On average there are 250,000 hate crime 
7
victims each year, of which only one-third are re-
8
ported to the police. 
9
(13) It is Congress’ responsibility to provide for 
10
sustainable and feasible solutions to reduce, prevent 
11
and mitigate underlying factors responsible for bias 
12
incidents.
