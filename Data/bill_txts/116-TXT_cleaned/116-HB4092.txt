sulting from such violence, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Displaced, refugee, and stateless women and 
3
girls in humanitarian emergencies, conflict settings, 
4
and natural disasters face extreme violence and 
5
threats, including— 
6
(A) rape and sexual assault; 
7
(B) domestic or intimate partner violence; 
8
(C) child, early, and forced marriage; 
9
(D) trafficking for the purposes of sexual 
10
exploitation and forced labor; 
11
(E) harmful traditional practices such as 
12
female genital mutilation or cutting; and 
13
(F) harassment, exploitation, and abuse by 
14
humanitarian personnel. 
15
(2) Gender-based violence is known to increase 
16
during humanitarian emergencies. Violent acts such 
17
as intimate partner violence and child marriage that 
18
take place during times of stability are often exacer-
19
bated during times of crisis. 
20
(3) Nearly one in five women report experi-
21
encing sexual violence during a humanitarian emer-
22
gency. For example, according to the United Nations 
23
Organization Stabilization Mission in the Demo-
24
cratic Republic of the Congo, there was an increase 
25
00:12 Aug 15, 2019
H4092
3 
•HR 4092 IH
of 56 percent in reported cases of conflict-related 
1
sexual violence between 2016 and 2017. 
2
(4) Intimate partner violence is pervasive and 
3
becomes increasingly common during times of con-
4
flict and crisis. Residence in a conflict-affected dis-
5
trict is associated with a 50-percent increase in risk 
6
of intimate partner violence, and women who have 
7
experienced 4–5 cumulative years of conflict are al-
8
most 90 percent more likely to experience such vio-
9
lence than women who are not living in conflict set-
10
tings. 
11
(5) Child, early, and forced marriages increase 
12
during humanitarian crises as tools of last resort to 
13
cope with economic hardship and to protect girls 
14
from increased violence. Conflict can exacerbate cul-
15
tural norms of child, early, and forced marriage or 
16
create harmful cultural behaviors where they had 
17
not previously existed. 
18
(6) Women and girls are especially vulnerable 
19
to trafficking during humanitarian crises, particu-
20
larly by non-State armed groups who abduct and 
21
traffic women and girls for sexual exploitation, do-
22
mestic servitude, and child, early, and forced mar-
23
riage, among other forms of exploitation. 
24

H4092

•HR 4092 IH
(7) Crises create markets for exploitative serv-
1
ices that are too frequently abused by aid workers 
2
and peacekeepers, who seek sexual services from dis-
3
placed or vulnerable people. In 2018, the United Na-
4
tions received a total of 148 sexual exploitation and 
5
abuse allegations directly involving United Nations 
6
aid workers, and 111 involving staff from partner 
7
organizations implementing United Nations pro-
8
grams. 
9
(8) According to United Nations High Commis-
10
sioner for Refugees, marginalized populations are 
11
particularly at risk of gender-based violence in hu-
12
manitarian crises, including adolescent girls, older 
13
persons, persons with disabilities, sexual and gender 
14
minorities, and female heads of households. 
15
(9) Gender-based violence is under-reported, 
16
both in times of stability and during crises. While 
17
data may not be immediately available in each crisis 
18
or conflict, evidence shows that gender-based vio-
19
lence is consistently a major and pressing concern 
20
for women and girls facing humanitarian emergency 
21
contexts and should be assumed to be a protection 
22
concern in all humanitarian planning and risk as-
23
sessment.

•HR 4092 IH
(10) Men and boys play a critical role in pre-
1
venting gender-based violence, and engaging them 
2
alongside women and girls in the transformation of 
3
gender roles that lead to increased rates of gender- 
4
based violence at the onset of emergencies leads to 
5
lasting results. 
6
(11) Survivors of gender-based violence and 
7
their families in humanitarian emergencies require 
8
immediate, life-saving assistance, including post-rape 
9
care or access to other comprehensive medical and 
10
psychosocial services, to address the physical, psy-
11
chological, and social impacts of gender-based vio-
12
lence. They also require long-term support such as 
13
opportunities to earn livelihoods, build skills or re-
14
ceive an education, and access to justice and com-
15
munity-level reintegration. Early medical interven-
16
tions after incidents of rape can help to prevent in-
17
fections, HIV, and pregnancy. 
18
(12) Empowering women to assume leadership 
19
roles in delivering humanitarian response and mean-
20
ingfully engaging local organizations, including wom-
21
en’s rights, humanitarian, advocacy, and service-pro-
22

vide life-saving assistance is critical to supporting 
1
survivors or those at risk of gender-based violence. 
2
(13) The international community has priori-
3
tized addressing the issue of gender-based violence 
4
in humanitarian contexts by launching a Global Call 
5
to Action on Protection from Gender-Based Violence 
6
in Emergencies in 2013, which the United States 
7
operationalized through establishing a Safe from the 
8
Start initiative, implemented by the Department of 
9
State and the United States Agency for Inter-
10
national Development. 
11
(14) Safe from the Start aimed to prevent and 
12
respond to gender-based violence at the onset of an 
13
emergency and to provide resources to strengthen 
14
the core capacity of humanitarian assistance imple-
15
menters to address gender-based violence at the ear-
16
liest phases of an emergency, including through de-
17
veloping training, guidelines, toolkits, and other re-
18
sources to guide operations. 
19
(15) The Women’s Entrepreneurship and Eco-
20
nomic Empowerment Act (Public Law 115–428) re-
21
quires the United States ‘‘to strive to eliminate gen-
22
der-based violence and mitigate its harmful effects 
23
on individuals and communities’’ in its development
