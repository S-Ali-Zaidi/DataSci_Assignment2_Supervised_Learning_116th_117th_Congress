5
lowing:

9
(B) State reported unfunded pension liabil-
10
ities among the several States at the end of fis-
11
cal year 2018 totaled $1,237,791,372,000. 
12
(C) The economic impact of the COVID– 
13
19 pandemic is likely to further increase the 
14
unfunded liabilities of employee benefit plans of 
15
the States and increase the annual cost of these 
16
systems, creating fiscal tension between funding 
17
essential government services and servicing un-
18
funded liabilities.

reductions in expected revenues of the States

while at the same time increasing public de-
22
mand for essential government services.

islature determines that performance of its supreme 
1
obligation is impaired by funding otherwise required 
2
under any health, welfare, retirement, or other ben-
3
efit plan offered to its employees, then that State’s 
4
legislature, with its Governor’s consent, may change 
5
the terms of any such benefit plan to the extent it 
6
was not contemporaneously funded in any manner it 
7
determines to be necessary and proper, notwith-
8
standing the terms of any State law or constitution

to the contrary.
