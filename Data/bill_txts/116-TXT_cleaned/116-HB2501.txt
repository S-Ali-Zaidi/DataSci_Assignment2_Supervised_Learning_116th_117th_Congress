To provide for the coverage of medically necessary food and 
vitamins and individual amino acids for digestive and 
inherited metabolic disorders under Federal health pro-
grams and private health insurance, and for other pur-
poses. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Each year, thousands of children and adults 
3
in the United States are diagnosed with certain di-
4
gestive or inherited metabolic disorders that prevent 
5
their bodies from digesting or metabolizing the food 
6
they need to survive. For them, medically necessary 
7
food, which can often be administered as an orally 
8
consumed formula, is their treatment. 
9
(2) Without medically necessary food, these pa-
10
tients risk malnutrition, surgery, and repeated hos-
11
pitalizations. They may suffer intellectual disability 
12
or even death. Risks in pediatric populations are 
13
particularly profound and often severe and also in-
14
clude inadequate growth, abnormal development, 
15
cognitive impairment, and behavioral disorders. Spe-
16
cialized medically necessary food is standard-of-care 
17
therapy for these patients and is essential to pre-
18
venting such outcomes. 
19
(3) While not every person diagnosed with these 
20
conditions needs to be treated with medically nec-
21
essary food for a prolonged period, it is critical that 
22
patients and their physicians be able to consider the 
23
full range of options and select the treatment that 
24
will be most effective for each patient. 
25

•HR 2501 IH
(4) Insurance companies will typically cover 
1
pharmaceuticals or biologics for treatment of some 
2
of these conditions. However, these types of treat-
3
ments may not be the first-line therapy a physician 
4
would recommend, do not work for all patients, and 
5
can have undesirable risks, such as cancer or sup-
6
pression of the immune system, which can increase 
7
a patient’s risk of infection. 
8
(5) Even when an insurance company does 
9
cover medically necessary food, it often comes with 
10
the stipulation that the formula be administered 
11
through a feeding tube, which requires expensive 
12
surgery and carries additional risks for the patient. 
13
(6) Testing for select inborn errors of metabo-
14
lism is required in all States, and more than 7,000 
15
babies per year are diagnosed with an inherited met-
16
abolic disorder. Yet, policies on medically necessary 
17
food vary significantly and do not always make it 
18
possible for families to get sufficient nutrition for 
19
their affected children.
