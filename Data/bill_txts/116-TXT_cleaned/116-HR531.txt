RESOLUTION 
Expressing concern over the prevalence of hazardous working 
conditions for children, especially the worst forms of 
child labor in the mining of cobalt and other minerals 
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. 
Whereas the Department of Labor has reported that the 
worst forms of child labor have been exploited in the ex-
traction and processing of cobalt ore in the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo (DRC) and these activities are in 
violation of international standards; 
Whereas the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) es-
timated that 40,000 children work in mines in the former

Province of Katanga, DRC, including in the cobalt sec-
tor; 
Whereas the DRC continues to be the world’s leading source 
of mined cobalt, supplying more than 64 percent of global 
cobalt production in 2018; 
Whereas for their economic survival, families often encourage 
children to work, including in the mining sector; 
Whereas cobalt is a strategic and critical mineral used in nu-
merous diverse commercial, industrial, and military appli-
cations, for which demand is growing; 
Whereas Amnesty International found major electronics and 
electric vehicle companies are still not doing enough to 
stop human rights abuses entering their cobalt supply 
chains; 
Whereas key stakeholders, especially industry groups, trade 
associations, and private companies, have an individual 
responsibility to identify, prevent, and take action to halt 
hazardous and working conditions in their cobalt supply 
chains, and to conduct due diligence with the aim of re-
ducing child labor and improving working conditions in 
artisanal mines and in the broader cobalt supply chain, 
thereby respecting human rights, avoiding contributions 
to conflict, and advancing sustainable development; 
Whereas, in August 2017, the Government of the DRC issued 
a strategy on child labor in which it pledged to end child 
mining by 2025; and 
Whereas countries and companies that utilize cobalt have a 
responsibility to work with the Government of the DRC 
and actors in their supply chains to support actions to 
raise awareness, build enforcement capacity, and improve 
monitoring and remediation at the national, provincial,

and local levels with the aim of enhancing the capacity 
of private and public sector entities to eliminate the worst 
forms of child mining by 2025 and preventing the extrac-
tion, supply, and trade of minerals from exploiting chil-
dren or contributing to other human rights abuses: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) expresses concern over the prevalence of the 
2
hazardous, and especially the worst forms of, child 
3
labor in the mining of cobalt and other minerals in

the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC); 
5
(2) urges the Secretary of State, the Adminis-
6
trator of the United States Agency for International 
7
Development, and the Secretary of Labor to identify,

9
recipients of cobalt derived through child labor and 
10
for-profit or nonprofit entities that benefit indirectly 
11
or directly from the commercial use or trade of such 
12
cobalt; 
13
(3) calls on the Secretary of State, the Admin-

(4) calls on the Secretary of State, the Admin-

8
develop a strategy and action plan, such as in the

ernment of the DRC and the entity or other associa-

tion outlined above in paragraph (3) to take steps to 
13
end the worst forms of child labor in cobalt mining 
14
by 2025 by— 
15
(A) removing child labor in the extraction 
16
of cobalt, including in artisanal and small-scale 
17
mining, and replacing exploitive artisanal min-
18
ing with other forms of sustainable, productive 
19
economic activity to address local needs and 
20
support their reintegration into their commu-
21
nity; 
22
(B) ensuring that no minerals, including 
23
cobalt, that are produced with the use of the

16
(E) ensuring that efforts to end child par-
17
ticipation in cobalt mining are properly devel-
18
oped, robust, fully implemented, and monitored,

and that training is provided to those respon-
20
sible for executing these activities and to those 
21
