A BILL 
To support and expand civic engagement and political leader-
ship of adolescent girls around the world, and other 
purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Girls’ Leadership, En-
4
gagement, Agency, and Development Act of 2019’’ or the 
5
‘‘Girls LEAD Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
7
Congress makes the following findings: 
8
(1) Inclusive democracy and governance are 
9
fundamental objectives and critical foundations for 
10

•HR 6626 IH
sustainable development and global peace. Pro-
1
motion of democracy, human rights, and governance 
2
is a reflection of fundamental American values and 
3
identity. 
4
(2) Democracies score consistently higher than 
5
nondemocracies on a broad range of socioeconomic 
6
development indicators, including infant and child 
7
mortality, life expectancy, primary school enrollment, 
8
adult literacy, female youth literacy, female sec-
9
ondary school enrollment, and access to clean water. 
10
(3) Women’s political participation results in 
11
tangible gains for democracy, including greater re-
12
sponsiveness to citizen needs, increased cooperation 
13
across party and ethnic lines, and more sustainable 
14
peace. 
15
(4) Women in leadership positions are more 
16
likely to resolve national crises without resorting to 
17
violence, sustain peace agreements over longer peri-
18
ods of time, advocate for social issues that benefit 
19
all, and allocate budgets to health and education. 
20
(5) Despite comprising over 50 percent of the 
21
world’s population, women are underrepresented at 
22
all levels of public sector decision making. At the 
23
current rate of progress, it will take over 100 years 
24
to achieve gender parity in political participation.

(6) Engaging adolescent girls more in civil and 
1
political activities contributes to increased political 
2
participation and women’s leadership around the 
3
world over time. Adolescents who participate actively 
4
in their community from early on are more likely to 
5
become engaged citizens and voters, with higher lev-
6
els of ambition for future leadership positions in 
7
both politics and the private sector. Their safe, 
8
meaningful, and appropriate participation is key to 
9
creating democratic societies with informed and en-
10
gaged citizens. 
11
(7) Adolescence is a critical period in a girl’s 
12
life, when significant physical, emotional, and social 
13
changes shape her future. Adolescent girls are par-
14
ticularly vulnerable to HIV/AIDS, child, early, and 
15
forced marriage, and other forms of gender-based vi-
16
olence, including sexual exploitation, harassment, 
17
and assault, which are detrimental to their futures. 
18
(8) Approximately 132,000,000 adolescent girls 
19
between the ages of 6–17 are out of school. United 
20
Nations data revealed an increase of over six percent 
21
in the number of adolescent girls not in primary 
22
school, in just one year, from 32,000,000 in 2015 to 
23
34,000,000 in 2016.

(9) By 2030, over 150,000,000 more adolescent 
1
girls will marry as children. Despite global progress, 
2
12,000,000 adolescent girls under 18 will marry an-
3
nually. The number one cause of death for adoles-
4
cent girls 15–19 years old is childbirth, and 90 per-
5
cent of births to adolescent girls 15–19 occur within 
6
a marriage. 
7
(10) Every 10 minutes, somewhere in the 
8
world, an adolescent girl dies as a result of violence. 
9
A girl’s risk of dying as a result of violence increases 
10
from early to late adolescence. Violence is the second 
11
leading cause of death among adolescent girls glob-
12
ally. 
13
(11) Empowering adolescent girls and young 
14
women in childhood and as they transition to become 
15
adults, investing in their leadership potential, and 
16
ensuring there are established pathways to positions 
17
of political leadership and civic engagement con-
18
tribute to ensuring a world where women can thrive 
19
as political leaders and decisionmakers, in economic 
20
spaces and across society as a whole.
