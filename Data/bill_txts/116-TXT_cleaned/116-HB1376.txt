A BILL 
To require a report on the continuing participation of 
Cambodia in the Generalized System of Preferences. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Cambodia Trade Act 
4
of 2019’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Prime Minister Hun Sen has been in power 
8
in Cambodia since 1985 and is the longest-serving 
9
leader in Southeast Asia.

•HR 1376 IH
(2) The Paris Peace Accords in 1991 provided 
1
a vital framework, supported by the United States, 
2
European Union, and Japan, intended to help Cam-
3
bodia undertake a transition to democracy, including 
4
through elections and multiparty democracy. 
5
(3) For more than 25 years, the United States 
6
Government has provided hundreds of millions of 
7
dollars in development aid and other types of assist-
8
ance to the people of Cambodia, including pref-
9
erential trade treatment. 
10
(4) In 1997, the United States included Cam-
11
bodia in the Generalized System of Preferences 
12
(GSP) program, which extends specialized duty-free 
13
exports to developing nations. 
14
(5) The Trade Act of 1974 establishes condi-
15
tions of eligibility for inclusion in GSP, including 
16
‘‘whether or not other major developed countries are 
17
extending generalized preferential tariff treatment to 
18
such country’’, and ‘‘whether or not such country 
19
has taken or is taking steps to afford to workers in 
20
that country (including any designated zone in that 
21
country) internationally recognized worker rights’’. 
22
(6) The two sectors in Cambodia’s economy 
23
that benefits from GSP are garment and handbag 
24
production. The garment industry is the largest em-

ployer in Cambodia’s economy and accounts for 
1
nearly half of gross domestic product growth. The 
2
sector employs more than 700,000 Cambodians, 
3
most of whom are women. In 2018, Human Rights 
4
Watch warned that these women are often subjected 
5
to forced overtime and pregnancy-based discrimina-
6
tion, and denied paid maternity leave. 
7
(7) In 2015, Human Rights Watch released a 
8
broader study on the garment sector in Cambodia 
9
with the following finding: ‘‘[Labor rights abuses] 
10
include forced overtime and retaliation against those 
11
who sought exemption from overtime, lack of rest 
12
breaks, denial of sick leave, use of underage child 
13
labor, and the use of union-busting strategies to 
14
thwart independent unions.’’. 
15
(8) In October 2017, the Office of the United 
16
States Trade Representative (USTR) announced a 
17
new triennial process to assess GSP beneficiary 
18
country eligibility. The first assessment period cov-
19
ered 25 Asian and Pacific Island GSP beneficiary 
20
countries. For each such country, USTR and other 
21
United States Government agencies examined the 
22
country’s policies and practices related to each of 
23
the 15 eligibility criteria established by Congress, in-
24
cluding respecting arbitral awards in favor of United 
25

States citizens or corporations, combating child 
1
labor, respecting internationally recognized worker 
2
rights, providing adequate and effective intellectual 
3
property protection, reducing barriers to services 
4
trade and investment, and providing the United 
5
States with equitable and reasonable market access. 
6
In April 2018, USTR announced that it is reviewing 
7
the eligibility of India, Indonesia, and Kazakhstan in 
8
the GSP program based on concerns about the coun-
9
tries’ compliance with the program. This review did 
10
not mention Cambodia. 
11
(9) In the 2017 Human Rights Report, the De-
12
partment of State warned: ‘‘Labor inspectors did not 
13
enforce labor standards in the informal sector or in 
14
unlicensed workplaces. In the formal sector, sources 
15
reported labor inspectors conducted routine inspec-
16
tions only in registered garment and footwear fac-
17
tories, where the incidence of child labor remained 
18
extremely low.’’. 
19
(10) In its country-specific Cambodia report in 
20
2017, the Department of Labor stated: ‘‘When child 
21
labor inspections do occur, they are concentrated in 
22
the city of Phnom Penh, as well as in the provincial, 
23
formal-sector factories producing goods for export, 
24
such as textiles and garments.’’.

(11) In 2018, the Department of Labor re-
1
leased a report on goods produced by child labor 
2
pursuant to the Trafficking Victims Protection Re-
3
authorization Act of 2005, and identified Cambodia 
4
as one of four countries, including the People’s Re-
5
public of China, which produces textiles with child 
6
labor. 
7
(12) The European Union established ‘‘Every-
8
thing But Arms’’ (EBA) in 2001, a comparable 
9
GSP program, which included Cambodia. The Euro-
10
pean Union began the formal process of reviewing 
11
Cambodia’s inclusion in EBA in 2018 in response to 
12
Prime Minister Hun Sen’s authoritarian manipula-
13
tion of the 2018 general elections, which included 
14
imprisoning 
Cambodia 
National 
Rescue 
Party 
15
(CNRP) President Kem Sokha, dissolving CNRP, 
16
and closing independent newspapers and radio sta-
17
tions. 
18
(13) On February 11, 2019, the European 
19
Commission launched a procedure that could lead to 
20
suspension of Cambodia from EBA trade pref-
21
erences. In the announcement the Commission stat-
22
ed: ‘‘Following a period of enhanced engagement, in-
23

24
2018 and subsequent bilateral meetings at the high-

est level, the Commission has concluded that there 
1
is evidence of serious and systematic violations of 
2
core human rights and labour rights in Cambodia, in 
3
particular of the rights to political participation as 
4
well as of the freedoms of assembly, expression and 
5
association. These findings add to the longstanding 
6
EU concerns about the lack of workers’ rights and 
7
disputes linked to economic land concessions in the 
8
country.’’.
