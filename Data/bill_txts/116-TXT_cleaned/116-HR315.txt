RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the designation of April 2019 as 
‘‘National Donate Life Month’’. 
Whereas, in April 2019, over 113,000 individuals were on the 
official waiting list managed for organ donation by the 
Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network estab-
lished under section 372 of the Public Health Service Act 
(42 U.S.C. 274) (referred to in this resolution as the 
‘‘national transplant waiting list’’); 
Whereas in 2018, 36,529 transplant procedures were per-
formed with organs from 10,721 deceased donors and 
6,841 living donors, yet on average, 20 people die each 
day while waiting for an organ donation;

Whereas over 145,000,000 people in the United States are 
registered to be organ and tissue donors, yet the demand 
for donated organs outweighs the supply of organs made 
available each day; 
Whereas, in 2018, a record was set for the number of organ 
transplants performed in a single year, for the sixth con-
secutive year, yet every 10 minutes, 1 person is added to 
the national transplant waiting list; 
Whereas an organ donation from a single deceased donor can 
benefit up to 8 individuals, and tissue donation can ben-
efit an additional 75 or more; 
Whereas a living donor can donate a kidney or a portion of 
a lung or the liver to save the life of another individual; 
and 
Whereas April is traditionally recognized as ‘‘National Do-
nate Life Month’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the goals and ideals of National 
2
Donate Life Month; 
3
(2) supports promoting awareness of organ and 
4
tissue donation by increasing public awareness; 
5
(3) encourages States, localities, and territories 
6
of the United States to support the goals and ideals 
7
of National Donate Life Month by issuing a procla-
8
mation to designate ‘‘National Donate Life Month’’;

(4) commends each individual who—
