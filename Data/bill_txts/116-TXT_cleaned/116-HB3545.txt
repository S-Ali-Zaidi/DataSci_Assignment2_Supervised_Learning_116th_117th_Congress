SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The incidence of violence known as hate 
3
crimes or crimes motivated by bias poses a serious 
4
national problem. 
5
(2) According to data obtained by the Federal 
6
Bureau of Investigation, the incidence of such vio-
7
lence increased in 2017, the most recent year for 
8
which data is available. 
9
(3) In 1990, Congress enacted the Hate Crime 
10
Statistics Act (Public Law 101–275; 28 U.S.C. 534 
11
note) to provide the Federal Government, law en-
12
forcement agencies, and the public with data regard-
13
ing the incidence of hate crime. The Hate Crimes 
14
Statistics Act and the Matthew Shepard and James 
15
Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act (division E of 
16
Public Law 111–84; 123 Stat. 2835) have enabled 
17
Federal authorities to understand and, where appro-
18
priate, investigate and prosecute hate crimes. 
19
(4) A more complete understanding of the na-
20
tional problem posed by hate crime is in the public 
21
interest and supports the Federal interest in eradi-
22
cating bias-motivated violence referenced in section 
23
249(b)(1)(C) of title 18, United States Code. 
24
(5) However, a complete understanding of the 
25
national problem posed by hate crimes is hindered 
26
20:35 Jul 09, 2019
H3545
3 
•HR 3545 IH
by incomplete data from Federal, State, and local 
1
jurisdictions through the Uniform Crime Reports 
2
program authorized under section 534 of title 28, 
3
United States Code, and administered by the Fed-
4
eral Bureau of Investigation. 
5
(6) Multiple factors contribute to the provision 
6
of inaccurate and incomplete data regarding the in-
7
cidence of hate crime through the Uniform Crime 
8
Reports program. A significant contributing factor is 
9
the quality and quantity of training that State and 
10
local law enforcement agencies receive on the identi-
11
fication and reporting of suspected bias-motivated 
12
crimes. 
13
(7) The problem of crimes motivated by bias is 
14
sufficiently serious, widespread, and interstate in na-
15
ture as to warrant Federal financial assistance to 
16
States and local jurisdictions. 
17
(8) Federal financial assistance with regard to 
18
certain violent crimes motivated by bias enables Fed-
19
eral, State, and local authorities to work together as 
20
partners in the investigation and prosecution of such 
21
crimes.
