RESOLUTION 
Calling upon all candidates for Federal office to respect 
the American tradition of the peaceful transfer of power 
and reject any efforts to prevent people from exercising 
their right to vote. 
Whereas the 15th Amendment guarantees the right to vote 
shall not be denied on account of race or color; 
Whereas the 19th Amendment guarantees the right to vote 
shall not be denied on account of sex; 
Whereas, in 1964, the Supreme Court of the United States 
held that ‘‘The right to vote freely for the candidate of 
one’s choice is of the essence of a democratic society, and

any restrictions on that right strike at the heart of rep-
resentative government.’’; 
Whereas the 20th Amendment states that the term of the 
President ends at noon on the 20th day of January; 
Whereas since George Washington left office in 1797, every 
transfer between Presidential administrations has been 
peaceful; 
Whereas the 1876, 1888, 2000, and 2016 elections featured 
the winner of the popular vote losing the electoral college, 
but still resulted in a peaceful transfer of power; 
Whereas, on September 23, 2020, in response to the question 
‘‘Win, lose, or draw in this election, will you commit here, 
today, for a peaceful transferal of power after the elec-
tion?’’ President Trump responded ‘‘Well, we’re going to 
have to see what happens. You know that. I’ve been com-
plaining very strongly about the ballots. And the ballots 
are a disaster.’’; and 
Whereas when given the opportunity to clarify his statement, 
President Trump stated that ‘‘We want to have—get rid 
of the ballots and you’ll have a very trans—we’ll have a 
very peaceful—there won’t be a transfer, frankly; there’ll 
be a continuation. The ballots are out of control. You 
know it.’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
