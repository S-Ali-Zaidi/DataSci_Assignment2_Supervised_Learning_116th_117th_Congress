To encourage the protection and promotion of internationally

pandemic, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Protecting Human 
4
Rights During Pandemic Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress makes the following findings: 
7
(1) The United States led the drafting of the 
8
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which en-
9

•HR 6986 IH
shrines the commitment of countries around the 
1
world to the protection and promotion of universal 
2
human rights and values that are indispensable for 
3
human dignity, including the rights to life, liberty, 
4
security of person, freedom of movement, religion, 
5
speech, peaceful assembly, association, freedom of 
6
expression and the press, and freedom from arbi-
7
trary detention, discrimination, or invasion of pri-
8
vacy. 
9
(2) Authorities in more than 83 countries, in-
10
cluding the United States, have declared states of 
11
emergency and restricted the movement of people 
12
due to the threat of the novel coronavirus, which 
13
causes COVID–19, and which the World Health Or-
14
ganization designated a global pandemic on March 
15
11, 2020. 
16
(3) During public health emergencies, it may be 
17
necessary and appropriate for governments to take 
18
extraordinary action to halt the spread of disease 
19
through steps such as restricting the movement of 
20
people, closing businesses, and limiting access to 
21
public spaces. 
22
(4) States are legally obligated to continue to 
23
protect the human rights of their citizens at all 
24
times, subject to the principles of limitation and 
25
01:04 Jun 18, 2020

•HR 6986 IH
derogation, even and especially during national 
1
emergencies. 
2
(5) In many countries with COVID–19 cases, 
3
governments have taken steps that violate the 
4
human rights of their citizens without clear scientific 
5
or public health justifications, or any end date or 
6
functional oversight. 
7
(6) In some countries, including China and 
8
Russia, governments are using existing and emerg-
9
ing surveillance technologies, including artificial in-
10
telligence and facial recognition software, without 
11
appropriate safeguards, which violates the human 
12
rights of their citizens, such as the rights to privacy 
13
and freedom of movement, while claiming such ac-
14
tions are necessary to combat the novel coronavirus. 
15
(7) In some countries, including Azerbaijan, El 
16
Salvador, Hungary, Kazakhstan, and the Phil-
17
ippines, governments with a history of repressing 
18
human rights are exploiting the current crisis to 
19
consolidate power, sideline representative legislative 
20
bodies, and silence criticism. 
21
(8) In several countries, including Algeria, 
22
Azerbaijan, Belarus, Cambodia, China, Egypt, Hon-
23
duras, Hungary, Iran, Jordan, Russia, South Africa, 
24
Tajikistan, 
Thailand, 
the 
Philippines, 
Turkey, 
25
01:04 Jun 18, 2020

•HR 6986 IH
Turkmenistan, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe, govern-
1
ments have restricted the ability of journalists and 
2
other individuals to distribute or publish information 
3
related to the novel coronavirus, including by impos-
4
ing criminal penalties, which violates the universal 
5
human rights of free speech and freedom of the 
6
press, and limits people’s access to information. 
7
(9) Governments in countries with a history of 
8
discrimination against minority populations, includ-
9
ing India and Uganda, have used the novel 
10
coronavirus pandemic response to further discrimi-
11
nate against vulnerable populations. 
12
(10) Actions taken by foreign governments, 
13
under the guise of the coronavirus, that weaken 
14
democratic institutions and restrict internationally 
15
recognized human rights, contrary to the principles 
16
of limitation and derogation, pose a threat to the 
17
health, economic, and national security interests of 
18
the United States.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.
