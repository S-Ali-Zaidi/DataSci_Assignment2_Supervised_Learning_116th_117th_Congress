To provide for research and education with respect to uterine

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Uterine Fibroid Re-
4
search and Education Act of 2020’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds as follows: 
2
(1) It is estimated that between 20 and 30 per-
3
cent of women of reproductive age have clinically 
4
recognized uterine fibroids, and screening studies in-
5
dicate the prevalence of uterine fibroids in women 
6
may be much higher. 
7
(2) In the United States, an estimated 
8
26,000,000 women between the ages of 15 and 50 
9
have uterine fibroids. Uterine fibroids may cause sig-
10
nificant morbidity through their presence in the 
11
uterus and pelvic cavity, causing significant pelvic 
12
pain, iron-deficiency anemia, miscarriages, infer-
13
tility, and heavy bleeding—one of the most common 
14
and bothersome symptoms. 
15
(3) The pain, discomfort, stress, and other 
16
physical and emotional symptoms of living with 
17
fibroids may significantly interfere with a woman’s 
18
quality of life, compromising her ability to function 
19
normally or work or care for her family, and may 
20
lead to more severe health and wellness issues. 
21
(4) The development of uterine fibroids is a 
22
common and significant health problem, affecting 
23
women, primarily of reproductive age, across all 
24
ages, racial backgrounds, and socioeconomic levels.

•HR 6383 IH
(5) Most women will experience uterine fibroids 
1
by the age of 50, yet few data exist describing the 
2
overall patient experience with fibroids. Women with 
3
fibroids or symptoms suggestive of fibroids experi-
4
ence significant distress that reduces quality of life 
5
and many women are likely undiagnosed, under-
6
scoring the need for improved awareness and edu-
7
cation. 
8
(6) Minority women are more likely to develop 
9
uterine fibroids. It is estimated that more than 80 
10
percent of African-American women and about 70 
11
percent of Caucasian women develop fibroids by the 
12
time they reach menopause. African-American 
13
women have also been shown to have more severe 
14
symptoms and develop early-onset uterine fibroids 
15
that develop into larger tumors. 
16
(7) The exact number of affected women is un-
17
known, because only 1 out of 4 women who have a 
18
uterine fibroid tumor exhibit symptoms severe 
19
enough to require treatment. 
20
(8) Current research and available data do not 
21
provide adequate information on the rates of preva-
22
lence and incidence of fibroids in Asian, Hispanic, 
23
and African-American minority women. There is no 
24
quantitative data available in regard to the costs as-
25

sociated with treating fibroids, and the methods by 
1
which fibroids may be prevented in these women 
2
available. 
3
(9) Symptomatic uterine fibroids can cause 
4
heavy menstrual bleeding, pain, and reproductive 
5
problems, including infertility. Women with uterine 
6
fibroids are much more likely to miscarry during 
7
early pregnancy than women without them. 
8
(10) According to the Evidence Report Sum-
9
mary on the Management of Uterine Fibroids, as 
10
compiled by the Agency for Healthcare Research and 
11
Quality of the Department of Health and Human 
12
Services, there is a ‘‘remarkable lack of high-quality 
13
evidence supporting the effectiveness of most inter-
14
ventions for symptomatic fibroids’’. 
15
(11) The presence of symptomatic uterine 
16
fibroids 
is 
the 
most 
common 
reason 
for 
17
hysterectomies, accounting for approximately one- 
18
third of hysterectomies, or 200,000 procedures an-
19
nually. Twenty-two percent of African-American 
20
women and 7 percent of Caucasian women have 
21
hysterectomies as a result of uterine fibroids. Lack 
22
of patient and provider awareness of less invasive al-
23
ternatives to hysterectomies lead to an estimated 
24
80,000 to 120,000 unnecessary hysterectomies an-
25
18:26 Apr 09, 2020

nually. Uterine fibroids are also the leading cause of 
1
hospitalization related to a gynecological disorder. 
2
(12) The personal and societal costs of uterine 
3
fibroids in the United States are significant. Uterine 
4
fibroid tumors have been estimated to cost the 
5
United States $5,900,000,000 to $34,400,000,000 
6
annually. The annual direct costs, including surgery, 
7
hospital admissions, outpatient visits, and medica-
8
tions, 
were 
estimated 
at 
$4,100,000,000 
to 
9
$9,400,000,000 annually. Estimated lost work-hour 
10
costs 
ranged 
from 
$1,550,000,000 
to 
11
$17,200,000,000 annually. Obstetric outcomes that 
12
were attributed to fibroid tumors resulted in costs of 
13
$238,000,000 to $7,760,000,000 annually.
