lent backlash occurred; 
Whereas Jacksonville NAACP President Rutledge Pearson, 
Jacksonville Youth Council NAACP member Rodney 
Hurst, and other community activists fought for social 
injustice by demonstrating at James Weldon Johnson 
Park; 
Whereas rioters planted and passed out ax handles and began

Whereas it was reported that authorities stood idly by, leav-
ing citizens and the peaceful protestors comprised of 
young students defenseless in the face of the violent mob;

tory practices, and risked their lives and reputations at 
James Weldon Johnson Park, to dismantle Jim Crow

jorie Meeks Brown, and Patricia Pearson; and
