(2) During a 40-year career with the National 
1
Park Service, Mr. Bearss distinguished himself as 
2
one of America’s preeminent historians, particularly 
3
in the field of the Civil War, not only through his 
4
work to preserve the places in which our Nation’s 
5
history was forged but also through his captivating 
6
interpretive storytelling about the people and events 
7
that shaped those places. 
8
(3) Mr. Bearss’ lifelong passion for Civil War 
9
history was kindled during his youth. Even at an 
10
early age, Mr. Bearss demonstrated a knack for 
11
committing facts to memory, a skill that helped him 
12
win school contests in history, current events, and 
13
geography. 
14
(4) He graduated high school in May 1941 and 
15
the following year joined the U.S. Marine Corps, 
16
serving with the 3rd Marine Raider Battalion during 
17
the invasion of Guadalcanal and the Russell Islands. 
18
He was badly wounded in gunfire at ‘‘Suicide 
19
Creek’’, Cape Gloucester, New Britain, while serving 
20
with the 7th Regiment, 1st Marine Division. 
21
(5) Upon returning home, Mr. Bearss attended 
22
Georgetown University, obtaining a bachelor’s de-
23
gree in Foreign Service studies, and later attended

Indiana University, earning a master’s degree in his-

(6) It was during a fortuitous visit to the Shi-
3
loh National Military Park in Tennessee, on a tour 
4
with the park historian, where the seeds were plant-
5
ed for Mr. Bearss’ future career with the National 
6
Park Service. 
7
(7) In 1955, he landed a job as park historian 
8
at the National Battlefield Park in Vicksburg, Mis-
9
sissippi, where his research helped fill in missing 
10
pieces of Civil War history. None were more signifi-
11
cant than the discovery of the USS Cairo, a long- 
12
lost Union ironclad gunboat sunk by Confederate 
13
submarine torpedoes in 1862 that was buried in the 
14
mud of the Yazoo River. Mr. Bearss later authored 
15
a book on the ‘‘sinking and salvage’’ of the ironclad. 
16
(8) It was during his tenure at Vicksburg that 
17
he met his wife, Margie, a teacher who shared Mr. 
18
Bearss’ love of history. They had three children, 
19
Sara, Cole, and Jenny. 
20
(9) Mr. Bearss became the National Park Serv-
21
ice’s chief historian in 1981. Following his retire-
22
ment in 1994, he was recognized with the title Chief 
23
Historian Emeritus, a fitting title as his research

and recounting of our Nation’s history continues to 
1
this day. 
2
(10) Whenever possible, he travels to our Na-
3
tion’s Civil War battlefields, helping to preserve the 
4
places where history happened and make those 
5
places come alive as a public historian. He once said, 
6
‘‘You can’t describe a battlefield unless you walk 
7
it.’’. Anyone who has spent time with Mr. Bearss 
8
touring a battlefield, sometimes braving the ele-
9
ments, enthralled by his prodigious tales regards 
10
him as a National Treasure. His unique chronicling 
11
of our Nation’s history has been described as a 
12
‘‘transcendental experience’’ of ‘‘Homeric mono-
13
logues’’ punctuated by ‘‘colorful, vivid images’’. Mr. 
14
Bearss himself has been described as a cross be-
15
tween ‘‘a good-natured platoon sergeant and Walter 
16
Cronkite’’. He lectures with his eye closed, so he can 
17
‘‘see’’ the history better, he once said. 
18
(11) Mr. Bearss has received multiple honors 
19
for his contributions to the preservation of our Na-
20
tion’s history: the Harry S. Truman Award in 1961 
21
for Meritorious Service in the field of Civil War his-

ment of the Interior’s Distinguished Service Award

in 1983, and a commendation from the Secretary of 
3
the Army in 1985. The Secretary of the Interior at 
4
the time, James Watt, called Mr. Bearss ‘‘unques-
5
tionably the most productive historian in the history 
6
of the National Park Service’’. 
7
(12) Mr. Bearss continued to tour the country 
8
well into his later years, visiting battlefields and 
9
Civil War organizations, to keep America’s history 
10
fresh in the minds of future generations.
