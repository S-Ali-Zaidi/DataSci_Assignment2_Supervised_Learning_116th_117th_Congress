A BILL 
To provide for mortgage forbearance during the COVID– 
19 emergency, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

SECTION 1. MORTGAGE FORBEARANCE.

(a) FINDINGS.— 
4
(1) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that— 
5
(A) the collection of debts involves the use 
6
of the mails and wires and other instrumental-
7
ities of interstate commerce; 
8
(B) at times of major disaster or emer-
9

paired and their necessary daily expenses often 
1
increase; 
2
(C) temporary forbearance benefits not 
3
only consumer and small business debtors, but 
4
also other creditors by avoiding downward col-
5
lateral price spirals triggered by an increase in 
6
foreclosure activity; 
7
(D) without forbearance, many consumers 
8
and small businesses are unlikely to be able to 
9
pay their obligations according to their original 
10
terms and are likely to default on obligations or 
11
file for bankruptcy, resulting in reduced recov-
12
eries for creditors, and in the case of bank-
13
ruptcy, no recovery of unaccrued interest; 
14
(E) with forbearance, creditors are likely 
15
to realize greater long-term value because con-
16
sumers and small businesses will be more likely 
17
to be able to repay their obligations after the 
18
major disaster or emergency has subsided; 
19
(F) the legislative and administrative re-
20
sponse to major disasters and emergencies may 
21
consist of multiple components divided among 
22
different statutes and programs; and 
23
(G) when evaluating whether property has 
24
been taken from a person without just com-

pensation, a holistic evaluation of the burdens 
1
and benefits of all legislative and administrative 
2
responses, including indirect benefits from mac-
3
roeconomic stabilization, is appropriate. 
4
(2) FURTHER FINDINGS REGARDING MORTGAGE 
5
FORBEARANCE.—Congress further finds that— 
6
(A) ensuring that consumers are able to 
7
remain in their residences reduces the disrup-
8
tions and economic harm caused by such disas-
9
ters and emergencies by ensuring that con-
10
sumers are able to continue their existing em-
11
ployment, education, childcare, and healthcare 
12
arrangements, which are often geographically 
13
based; 
14
(B) temporary forbearance on residential 
15
mortgages is therefore critical to fostering eco-
16
nomic recovery and stability in the wake of 
17
major disasters or emergencies; 
18
(C) temporary mortgage forbearance dur-
19
ing a declared disaster benefits not only mort-
20
gagors, but also mortgagees because mortga-
21
gors’ ability to pay is likely to be restored after 
22
a disaster or emergency subsides, so forbear-
23
ance may increase mortgagors’ total recovery. 
24
Without forbearance, mortgagors are likely to 
25

•HR 6340 IH
default or file for bankruptcy, resulting in sig-
1
nificant losses for mortgagees; and 
2
(D) temporary mortgage forbearance dur-
3
ing a declared disaster also benefits the mortga-
4
gees of other properties because housing prices 
5
are geographically and serially correlated so an 
6
increase in foreclosures can drive down the 
7
value of collateral for all mortgage lenders, fur-
8
ther destabilizing the economy. 
9
(3) FURTHER FINDINGS REGARDING MORTGAGE 
10
SERVICERS.—Congress further finds that— 
11
(A) mortgage servicers are often contrac-
12
tually obligated to advance scheduled mortgage 
13
payments to securitization investors, irrespec-
14
tive of whether the servicer collects the payment 
15
from the mortgagor; 
16
(B) mortgage servicers are often thinly 
17
capitalized and with limited capacity for engag-
18
ing in large scale advancing of payments to 
19
securitization investors; 
20
(C) securitization investors have long been 
21
aware of servicers’ thin capitalization; 
22
(D) in the wake of the 2008 financial cri-
23
sis, several servicers had difficulty obtaining 
24
sufficiently liquidity to make advances; 
25
22:46 Apr 13, 2020
H6340

•HR 6340 IH
(E) mortgage servicing is a heavily regu-
1
lated industry; 
2
(F) in response to the 2008 financial cri-
3
sis, Congress created a safe harbor for mort-
4
gage servicers that undertook loan modifica-
5
tions; 
6
(G) in response to the 2008 financial cri-
7
sis, the Home Affordable Modification Program 
8
paid mortgage servicers to undertake loan 
9
modifications; 
10
(H) as part of the 2012 joint State-Fed-
11
eral National Mortgage Settlement, mortgage 
12
servicers committed to undertaking loan modi-
13
fications; and 
14
(I) investors in mortgage securitizations 
15
are or should be aware of servicers’ thin cap-
16
italization, liquidity constraints, the extent and 
17
history of servicing regulation and therefore do 
18
not have a reasonable expectation that the 
19
terms of servicing contracts will be enforceable 
20
at times of national financial crisis. 
21
(4) DETERMINATION.—It is the sense of the 
22
Congress that, on the basis of the findings described 
23
under paragraphs (1), (2), and (3), the Congress de-
24
termines that the provisions of this Act are nec-
