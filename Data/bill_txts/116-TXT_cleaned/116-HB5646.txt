SEC. 2. FINDINGS, DECLARATIONS, AND PURPOSES. 
1
(a) FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS.—Congress finds 
2
and declares the following: 
3
(1) A vast number of records relating to Miss-
4
ing Armed Forces Personnel have not been identi-
5
fied, located, or transferred to the National Archives 
6
following review and declassification. Only in the 
7
rarest cases is there any legitimate need for contin-
8
ued protection of records pertaining to Missing 
9
Armed Forces Personnel who have been missing for 
10
decades. 
11
(2) There has been insufficient priority placed 
12
on identifying, locating, reviewing, or declassifying 
13
records relating to Missing Armed Forces Personnel 
14
and then transferring the records to the National 
15
Archives for public access. 
16
(3) Mandates for declassification set forth in 
17
multiple Executive orders have been broadly written, 
18
loosely interpreted, and often ignored by Federal 
19
agencies in possession and control of records related 
20
to Missing Armed Forces Personnel. 
21
(4) No individual or entity has been tasked with 
22
oversight of the identification, collection, review, and 
23
declassification of records related to Missing Armed 
24
Forces Personnel. 
25
01:22 Jan 18, 2020

•HR 5646 IH
(5) The interest, desire, workforce, and funding 
1
of Federal agencies to assemble, review, and declas-
2
sify records relating to Missing Armed Forces Per-
3
sonnel have been lacking. 
4
(6) All records of the Federal Government re-
5
lating to Missing Armed Forces Personnel should be 
6
preserved for historical and governmental purposes 
7
and for public research. 
8
(7) All records of the Federal Government re-
9
lating to Missing Armed Forces Personnel should 
10
carry a presumption of declassification, and all such 
11
records should be disclosed under this Act to enable 
12
the fullest possible accounting for Missing Armed 
13
Forces Personnel. 
14
(8) Legislation is necessary to create an en-
15
forceable, independent, and accountable process for 
16
the public disclosure of records relating to Missing 
17
Armed Forces Personnel. 
18
(9) Legislation is necessary because section 552 
19
of title 5, United States Code (commonly known as 
20
the ‘‘Freedom of Information Act’’), as implemented 
21
by Federal agencies, has prevented the timely public 
22
disclosure of records relating to Missing Armed 
23
Forces Personnel.

(b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this Act are—

•HR 5646 IH
