SEC. 2. PURPOSE. 
1
The purpose of this Act is to create a refundable tax 
2
credit for early childhood educators, teachers, early child-
3
hood education program directors, school leaders, and 
4
school-based mental health services providers in early 
5
childhood, elementary, and secondary education settings 
6
that rewards retention based on the time spent serving 
7
high-need students. 
8
SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
9
Congress finds the following: 
10
(1) The shortage of experienced, qualified early 
11
childhood educators and elementary school and sec-
12
ondary school teachers is a national problem that 
13
compromises the academic outcomes and long-term 
14
success of students. 
15
(2) The shortage is the result of many factors 
16
including low pay, frequent turnover in school lead-
17
ership, poor teaching conditions, and inadequate 
18
teacher supports. 
19
(3) The shortage is worse in high-poverty areas 
20
where the factors contributing to the shortage are 
21
particularly acute and have an increased negative 
22
impact on teachers of color remaining in the field. 
23
(4) A child’s access to high-quality early child-
24
hood education is critical to supporting positive out-
25
comes, and early childhood educators— 
26

•HR 7769 IH
(A) play an important role in setting the 
1
foundation for future learning, and 
2
(B) promote the development of vital skills, 
3
habits, and mindsets that children need to be 
4
successful in school and in life. 
5
(5) In 2015, the national median pay of early 
6
childhood educators was a mere $28,570, with many 
7
early childhood educators relying on government as-
8
sistance programs such as Medicaid, the supple-
9
mental nutrition assistance program established 
10
under the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 (7 U.S.C. 
11
2011 et seq.), or the temporary assistance for needy 
12
families program established under part A of title IV 
13
of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), 
14
and struggling to provide for their own families. 
15
(6) Studies have demonstrated that well-quali-
16
fied, experienced teachers are the single most impor-
17
tant school-based element contributing to a child’s 
18
academic achievement and success. 
19
(7) In 2016, the average teacher salary in pub-
20
lic elementary schools and secondary schools was 
21
only $58,950, which is on average 21.4 percent less 
22
than other college graduates working in non-teach-
23
ing fields, and with many teachers struggling with 
24
large amounts of student loan debt.

(8) An experienced, well-qualified education 
1
workforce must also be reflective of the diversity of 
2
the student body across race, ethnicity, and dis-
3
ability. 
4
(9) Experienced, well-qualified school leaders 
5
and school-based mental health service providers are 
6
essential for providing strong educational opportuni-
7
ties and services for students and promoting teacher 
8
retention through improved professional supports 
9
and teaching conditions.
