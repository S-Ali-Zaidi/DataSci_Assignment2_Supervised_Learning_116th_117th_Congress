SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Accountability for Sex-
2
ual and Gender-based Violence as a Tool in Conflict Act 
3
of 2019’’. 
4
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
5
Congress makes the following findings: 
6
(1) The United States, as a permanent member 
7
of the United Nations Security Council, voted in 
8
favor of Security Council Resolutions 1325 (2000); 
9
1820 (2008); 1888 (2009); 1960 (2010); 2106 
10
(2013); 2242 (2015); and 2331 (2016), which state 
11
that acts of sexual violence and human trafficking 
12
threaten international peace and security and can 
13
constitute war crimes, crimes against humanity, acts 
14
of genocide, and terrorism. 
15
(2) The United States is a signatory to the G8 
16
Declaration on Preventing Sexual Violence in Con-
17
flict, done in London April 11, 2013, and sponsored 
18
by the United Kingdom’s Foreign & Commonwealth 
19
Office’s Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative. The 
20
United States and its allies declared that concerns 
21
related to sexual violence in armed conflict must be 
22
part of peace and security efforts, post-conflict tran-
23
sition and reform measures, and accountability proc-
24
esses.

•HR 3212 IH
(3) Despite these advances in normative frame-
1
works, sexual and gender-based violence continues to 
2
be pervasive, and the responses from governments 
3
and the international community range from insuffi-
4
cient and inadequate to negligent and complicit, as 
5
documented in United Nations’ reports. 
6
(4) Gender-based violence, including sexual vio-
7
lence— 
8
(A) is a global pandemic that affects 1 in 
9
3 women during their lifetimes; and 
10
(B) occurs at higher rates in conflict-af-
11
fected areas. 
12
(5) Incidences of domestic violence, child, early, 
13
or forced marriages, human trafficking, and other 
14
forms of sexual and gender-based violence within 
15
displaced or conflict-affected communities— 
16
(A) increase during conflict due to exacer-
17
bated social tensions and underlying gender in-
18
equalities that existed in communities prior to 
19
such conflict; and 
20
(B) occur in parallel to sexual and gender- 
21
based violence perpetrated as a weapon of war. 
22
(6) Gender-based violence is underreported in 
23
all settings. Recorded cases of gender-based violence 
24
represent only a small fraction of the overall total. 
25

•HR 3212 IH
A lack of available data should not be interpreted to 
1
mean that gender-based violence is not a major and 
2
pressing issue, but should be viewed as an indication 
3
of the challenges in gathering information. 
4
(7) Rape and sexual assault have been used as 
5
tactics of war and terror in conflict zones, including 
6
Burma, Central African Republic, Colombia, the 
7
Democratic Republic of Congo, Iraq, Mali, Somalia, 
8
South Sudan, Sudan, and Syria. 
9
(8) Rape, sexual slavery, and other forms of 
10
sexual violence have been used by terrorist and ex-
11
tremist groups, such as the so-called Islamic State, 
12
Boko Haram, and the Lord’s Resistance Army, to 
13
intimidate and terrorize communities. 
14
(9) Sexual and gender-based violence in recent 
15
conflicts has been used in Iraq, Syria, and Burma 
16
as a form of ethnic or religious persecution or geno-
17
cide against Yazidis, Christians, Turkmen Shi’a, and 
18
Rohingya Muslims. 
19
(10) The Secretary-General of the United Na-
20
tions stated that sexual violence in conflict triggers 
21
mass migration and forced displacement. 
22
(11) Sexual and gender-based violence in con-
23
flict is primarily used against women and girls, but 
24
can also be used against men and boys.

•HR 3212 IH
(12) Sexual and gender-based violence is not in-
1
cidental to conflict and is a weapon of choice for 
2
armed actors seeking to destabilize societies, given 
3
that its stigma and trauma continue after the con-
4
flict has ended. 
5
(13) Existing laws often fail to protect sur-
6
vivors of conflict-related sexual or gender-based vio-
7
lence, especially when the perpetrators are represent-
8
atives of government entities, such as military offi-
9
cers, soldiers, or non-state actors operating in areas 
10
where governments have failed to keep the peace. 
11
(14) Under the doctrine of military command 
12
responsibility, leaders can be prosecuted for war 
13
crimes when they— 
14
(A) knew or should have known that their 
15
subordinates were committing war crimes; and 
16
(B) failed to take all necessary and reason-
17
able measures to prevent such crimes or inves-
18
tigate and prosecute those responsible for such 
19
crimes. 
20
(15) Courts with jurisdiction over war crimes 
21
may be nonexistent, may lack capacity, or may be 
22
subject to the same political failings that allowed 
23
conflict-related sexual or gender-based violence to 
24
take place. While the United Nations Security Coun-
25

•HR 3212 IH
cil could refer a case to the International Criminal 
1
Court, it is constrained by the prospects of a veto. 
2
(16) Convicting and imprisoning top military 
3
leaders with command or superior responsibility for 
4
rape or other forms of sexual and gender-based vio-
5
lence in conflict is essential to deter future crimes of 
6
sexual violence. Further support to civil society, 
7
grassroots organizations, women-led organizations, 
8
and justice actors is necessary to combat sexual vio-
9
lence and provide services and support to survivors. 
10
The landmark decision on December 15, 2017, by 
11
military justice authorities in the Democratic Repub-
12
lic of the Congo for the conviction of a provincial 
13
parliamentarian and members of the ‘‘Army of 
14
Jesus’’ militia for the crimes against humanity of 
15
rape of dozens of children in Kavumu, Democratic 
16
Republic of the Congo is a significant step for end-
17
ing impunity for sexual violence.

19

22
