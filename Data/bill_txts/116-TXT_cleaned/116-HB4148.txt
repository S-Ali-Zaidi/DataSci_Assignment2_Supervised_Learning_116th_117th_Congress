Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Green Jobs and Oppor-
4
tunity Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. 
6
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) The 21st century has some of the highest 
8
recorded temperatures in known history. 
9
(2) Scientists have high confidence that global 
10
temperatures will continue to rise for decades to 
11
come, largely due to greenhouse gases produced by 
12
human activities. 
13
(3) According to the Intergovernmental Panel 
14
on Climate Change (IPCC), which includes more 
15
than 1,300 scientists from the United States and 
16
other countries, there will likely be a temperature 
17
rise of 2.5 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit over the next 
18
century. 
19
(4) With only around 4.4 percent of the Earth’s 
20
population, World Bank studies have found that the 
21
United States is the second largest contributor of 
22
carbon dioxide emissions at 14.6 metric tons of CO2 
23
per capita.

(5) When the world gets hotter, it can fuel the 
1
proliferation of drought, typhoons, hurricanes, wild-
2
fires, and general habitat change, and can affect the 
3
availability of food and water, among other issues. 
4
(6) IPCC findings have revealed that the 
5
United States is projected to lose more than 
6
$500,000,000,000 in annual economic output by the 
7
year 2100 from global warming. 
8
(7) Additionally, the IPCC discovered that to 
9
avoid the most severe impacts of a changing climate, 
10
net-zero global emissions by 2050 will be required. 
11
(8) According to the Brookings Institution, a 
12
clean economy would encompass a vast array of in-
13
dustries and jobs directly involved in producing 
14
goods and providing services with an environmental 
15
benefit. 
16
(9) Under the 2019 Clean Jobs America report 
17
by E2 (Environmental Entrepreneurs), it is esti-
18
mated that 3.26 million workers are currently em-
19
ployed in, or are engaged in closely related activities, 
20
to the clean economy. 
21
(10) According to the International Labor Or-
22
ganization, by 2030, it is projected that over 24 mil-
23
lion new clean energy jobs will be needed globally to 
24
transition to a clean economy.

(11) To meet this clean energy agenda, invest-
1
ing in job training will be crucial to ensuring the 
2
United States has a readied workforce. 
3
(b) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act is to ensure 
4
the current United States workforce is prepared to transi-
5
tion to a clean energy economy.
