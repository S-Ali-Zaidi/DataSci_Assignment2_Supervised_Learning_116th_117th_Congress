SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Hours after the attacks on Pearl Harbor, 
3
Hawaii, Imperial Japanese forces launched an at-
4
tack on the Philippines, cutting off vital lines of 
5
communication to members of the Armed Forces of 
6
the United States (referred to in this Act as the 
7
‘‘Armed Forces’’) and Filipino troops in the Far 
8
East under the command of General Douglas Mac-
9
Arthur. 
10
(2) On December 8, 1941, the 200th and 515th 
11
Coast Artillery Regiments, successors to the New 
12
Mexico National Guardsmen who made up part of 
13
the famed ‘‘Rough Riders’’ of the Spanish-American 
14
War, were the ‘‘first to fire’’. 
15
(3) Despite being cut off from supply lines and 
16
reinforcements, members of the Armed Forces and 
17
Philippine troops quickly executed a plan to delay 
18
the Japanese invasion and defend the Philippines 
19
against that invasion. 
20
(4) Combined U.S.-Filipino ground forces fight 
21
a prolonged six-month resistance to Imperial Ja-
22
pan’s invasion of the Philippines. With the U.S. un-
23
able to deliver reinforcements, the U.S.-Filipino 
24
forces slowly deteriorate in combat effectiveness

through lack of food, supplies, ammunition, and dis-
1
ease as well as from no air and naval support. 
2
(5) By December 10, 1941, the U.S. Army Air 
3
Corps airfields at Del Carmen, Clark, Nichols, and 
4
Nielson on Luzon in the Philippines, as well as the 
5
nearby U.S. Naval facilities at Cavite and Olongapo 
6
had been destroyed. The surviving sailors, Marines, 
7
and airmen were organized into provisional infantry 
8
units and sent to fight on the Bataan Peninsula. 
9
(6) By April 1942, troops from the United 
10
States and the Philippines had bravely and staunch-
11
ly fought off enemy attacks in Bataan for more than 
12
4 months under strenuous conditions that resulted 
13
in widespread starvation and disease. 
14
(7) Securing the withdrawal of United States 
15
forces on Luzon to the Bataan Peninsula were— 
16
(A) 1,809 New Mexico National Guards-
17
men from 200th and 515th Coast Artillery 
18
(Antiaircraft) regiments. First stationed at 
19
Fort Stotsenberg north of Manila, they are 
20
credited as being the ‘‘First to Fire’’ in the de-
21
fense of the Philippines on December 8, 1941; 
22
(B) 1,006 National Guardsmen of the 
23
192nd GHQ Light Tank Battalion (596) com-
24
posed of Company A from Janesville, Wis-

consin; Company B from Maywood, Illinois; 
1
Company C from Port Clinton, Ohio; and Com-
2
pany D from Harrodsburg, Kentucky; and the 
3
194th Light Tank Battalion (410) composed of 
4
Company A from Brainerd, Minnesota; Com-
5
pany B from Saint Joseph, Missouri; and Com-
6
pany C from Salinas, California. The 192nd 
7
and 194th Tank Battalions had arrived in the 
8
Philippines on or before Thanksgiving Day 
9
1941; and 
10
(C) barely half of the men from these Na-
11
tional Guard units returned home at the end of 
12
the war, with the majority dying as POWs of 
13
the Imperial Japanese Army. 
14
(8) By maintaining their position and engaging 
15
the enemy for as long as they did, the troops at Ba-
16
taan were able to change the momentum of the war, 
17
delaying the Japanese timetable to take control of 
18
the Southeast Pacific for needed war materials. Be-
19
cause of the heroic actions of the defenders of Ba-
20
taan, members of the Armed Forces and other Allied 
21
forces throughout the Pacific had time to regroup 
22
and prepare for the successful liberation of the Pa-
23
cific and the Philippines.

(9) On April 9, 1942, approximately 12,000 
1
United States military personnel and 66,000 Fili-
2
pino soldiers became POWs with the surrender of 
3
the American-Filipino forces on the Bataan Penin-
4
sula in the Philippines by Major General Edward P. 
5
King. 
6
(10) Beginning on April 9 and lasting for al-
7
most two weeks, troops from the Armed Forces and 
8
the Philippines were taken prisoner and forced to 
9
march 65 miles without any food, water, or medical 
10
care in what came to be known as the ‘‘Bataan 
11
Death March’’. They marched from Marviveles north 
12
to the San Fernando train station. At San Fer-
13
nando, 
the 
men 
were 
packed 
standing 
in 
14
unventilated boxcars for 24-mile journey by rail to 
15
Capas. Survivors then marched an additional three 
16
miles to the make-shift POW camp at Camp 
17
O’Donnell, an unfinished Philippine Army training 
18
facility. 
19
(11) During this forced march, an estimated 
20
700 American and possibly 10,000 thousand Filipino 
21
soldiers died from starvation, lack of medical care, 
22
sheer exhaustion, or abuse by their captors. Hun-
23
dreds of men on the Death March remain unac-

counted for from the march and its immediate after-
1
math. 
2
(12) Conditions at the prisoner of war camps 
3
were appalling, leading to increased disease and mal-
4
nutrition, which precipitated extraordinary death 
5
rates of as high as 300 per day. 
6
(13) Thousands of troops fought under siege 
7
conditions on Corregidor (Fort Mills), a fortress is-
8
land in Manila Bay, the headquarters of the wartime 
9
U.S. Army Forces in the Far East, and the nearby 
10
fortified islands of Fort Hughes, Fort Drum, and 
11
Fort Frank until May 6, 1942. 
12
(14) On May 6, 1942, Corregidor, which had 
13
become the military command center for all the Phil-
14
ippines, United States Forces in the Philippines 
15
(USFIP), was surrendered by Lt. General Jonathan 
16
M. Wainwright. Nearly 10,000 American soldiers, 
17
sailors, airmen, and Marines as well as over 3,000 
18
Filipino soldiers and nurses become POWs of Impe-
19
rial Japan. 
20
(15) On June 6, 1942, the prisoners at Camp 
21
O’Donnell were transferred to Camp Cabanatuan, 
22
north of Camp O’Donnell. 
23
(16) Nearly 26,000 of the 50,000 Filipino pris-
24
oners of war died at Camp O’Donnell and survivors

were gradually paroled from September through De-
1
cember 1942. 
2
(17) Between September of 1942 and December 
3
of 1944, prisoners of war from the Armed Forces 
4
who had survived the horrific death march were 
5
shipped north for forced labor aboard ‘‘hell ships’’ 
6
and succumbed in great numbers because of the 
7
abysmal conditions. Many of those ships were mis-
8
takenly targeted by Allied naval forces because the 
9
Japanese military convoys were not properly labeled 
10
as carrying prisoners of war. The sinking of the 
11
Arisan Maru alone claimed nearly 1,800 lives of 
12
members of the Armed Forces. 
13
(18) The prisoners who remained in the camps 
14
suffered from continued mistreatment, malnutrition, 
15
lack of medical care, and horrific conditions until 
16
they were liberated in 1945. 
17
(19) The veterans of Bataan and Corregidor 
18
represented the best of the United States and the 
19
Philippines, hailed from various locales across both 
20
countries, and represented true diversity. 
21
(20) Over the subsequent decades, the veterans 
22
of Bataan and Corregidor formed support groups, 
23
were honored in local and State memorials, and told 
24
their stories to all people of the United States.

(21) The United States Navy has continued to 
1
honor the history and stories of the veterans of Ba-
2
taan by naming 2 ships after the battle, including 1 
3
ship that is still in service, the USS Bataan (LHD– 
4
5), in memory of their valor and honorable resist-
5
ance against Imperial Japanese forces. 
6
(22) Many of the survivors of Bataan and Cor-
7
regidor have died and those who remain continue to 
8
tell their stories. 
9
(23) The people of the United States and the 
10
Philippines are forever indebted to these men for— 
11
(A) the courage and tenacity they dem-
12
onstrated during the first 4 months of World 
13
War II fighting against enemy soldiers; and 
14
(B) the perseverance they demonstrated 
15
during 3 years of capture, imprisonment, and 
16
atrocious conditions, while maintaining dignity, 
17
honor, patriotism, and loyalty.
