(1) Hazing is a problem in the United States, 
1
but most especially in our Nation’s educational sys-
2
tem. 
3
(2) Hazing undermines the educational experi-
4
ence of the victims and the perpetrators. Hazing 
5
often perpetuates a cycle in which students who have 
6
been hazed feel the need to haze other students as 
7
a rite of passage to join a student organization. 
8
(3) While hazing takes many forms, including 
9
menial labor, disparagement, public or private hu-
10
miliation, and forced exercise, the combination of al-
11
cohol or drug consumption as a form of hazing has 
12
caused bodily injury to thousands of students and 
13
has been fatal in many instances. 
14
(4) Numerous students have died as a result of 
15
collegiate hazing. Some of the recent tragedies in-
16
clude Nicky Cumberland, Max Gruver, Tim Piazza, 
17
Dalton Debrick, Marquise Braham, and Harrison 
18
Kowiak.
