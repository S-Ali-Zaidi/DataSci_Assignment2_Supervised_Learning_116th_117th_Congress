•HR 4989 IH
(1) Heart disease is the leading cause of death 
1
in the United States. 
2
(2) Sudden cardiac arrest is the leading cause 
3
of death for student athletes. 
4
(3) In 2017, there were approximately 356,000 
5
sudden cardiac arrests that occurred in the United 
6
States, with 9 out of 10 being fatal (320,400). Only 
7
1 in 10 victims survive a sudden cardiac arrest 
8
(35,600). 
9
(4) The American Heart Association estimates 
10
that 5 in 10 victims (178,000) could survive if by-
11
standers gave CPR and used AEDs immediately, an 
12
additional 142,400 victims. 
13
(5) The chain of survival includes prompt noti-
14
fication of emergency services and early CPR, 
15
defibrillation, and advanced cardiac life support. 
16
(6) Health education should include basic emer-
17
gency lifesaving skills. Incorporating these lifesaving 
18
training programs into the health curriculum of ele-
19
mentary and secondary schools will give school chil-
20
dren these skills.
