SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Partnership Fund for 
2
Peace Act of 2019’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) Economic development in conflict settings 
6
has been shown to support stabilization by empow-
7
ering entrepreneurs, growing the middle class, and 
8
mitigating unemployment. 
9
(2) In 2018, unemployment in the Palestinian 
10
territories was 32.4 percent, reaching 53.7 percent 
11
in Gaza and 18 percent in the West Bank. GDP 
12
growth in the Palestinian territories declined from 
13
2.7 percent in 2017 to 2 percent in 2018, and it is 
14
projected to further decline to between 1.7 and 1.9 
15
percent in 2019 and 2020. 
16
(3) Increased economic activity and projects to 
17
improve the quality and conditions of life for the 
18
Palestinians will help create a viable Palestinian 
19
economy. 
20
(4) Although economic development is an im-
21
portant tool for stabilizing conflict-prone settings 
22
and establishing connections between communities, 
23
economic development by itself will not lead to last-
24
ing peace. People-to-people peacebuilding programs 
25
further advance reconciliation efforts by promoting 
26
05:06 Jun 12, 2019
H3104
3 
•HR 3104 IH
greater understanding, mutual trust, and coopera-
1
tion between communities. 
2
(5) While the United States and its inter-
3
national allies continue to support diplomatic and 
4
political negotiations between the representatives of 
5
the parties to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, such 
6
efforts require broad popular support among the 
7
people on the ground to succeed. 
8
(6) Achieving sustainable, high-level agreements 
9
for lasting peace in the Middle East must come 
10
through, and with the support of, the people who 
11
live there. 
12
(7) Economic initiatives and people-to-people 
13
peacebuilding programs can help millions of ordinary 
14
Israelis and Palestinians affected by the ongoing 
15
conflict in the Middle East. 
16
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
17
It is the sense of Congress that— 
18
(1) building a viable Palestinian economy is 
19
central to the effort to preserve the possibility of a 
20
2-state solution; 
21
(2) strengthening engagement between the Pal-
22
estinian territories, the United States and Israel in 
23
the areas of economic development and people-to- 
24
people peacebuilding programs will— 
25

•HR 3104 IH
(A) increase the bonds of friendship and 
1
understanding between the people living in the 
2
Palestinian territories and the people of the 
3
United States and Israel; and 
4
(B) advance the state of research and de-
5
velopment in multiple sectors to the benefit of 
6
all parties; 
7
(3) cooperation between the business sectors of 
8
the Palestinian territories, the United States and 
9
Israel will benefit the Palestinian, American, and 
10
Israeli people and should be encouraged; and 
11
(4) United States and international support for 
12
grassroots, people-to-people efforts aimed at shared 
13
reconciliation and fostering tolerance can help 
14
counter extremist propaganda and the growing issue 
15
of incitement.
