1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Private passenger automobile insurance 
3
companies are institutions which help spread risk of 
4
loss over a collective group of policyholders. 
5
(2) Private passenger automobile insurance is 
6
mandated in all States but New Hampshire. Legal 
7
penalties for operating a vehicle without liability in-
8
surance in these States range from fines, to license 
9
suspensions or revocations, to imprisonment. 
10
(3) The private passenger automobile insurance 
11
industry uses different variables to predict the over-
12
all costs and risks of drivers. The analysis and use 
13
of these variables ultimately help the automobile in-
14
surer set premium rates charged to consumers which 
15
the automobile insurer determines to be actuarially 
16
supported. 
17
(4) A pure loss ratio, a measurement of profit-
18
ability in insurance, is defined as losses divided by 
19
premiums. Statistical correlations between certain 
20
variables and pure loss ratios should be interpreted 
21
to mean that the selected variable relates to profit-
22
ability, but not necessarily to the risk that an indi-
23
vidual will get into an automobile accident. 
24
(5) A growing trend in the private passenger 
25
automobile insurance industry is to use income prox-
26
00:18 Jul 20, 2019
H3693

•HR 3693 IH
ies for underwriting and rating. The use of income 
1
proxies such as a driver’s education level, occupa-
2
tion, employment status, home ownership status, 
3
credit score, consumer report, previous insurer, and 
4
prior purchase of insurance by the industry as vari-
5
ables that significantly influence the insurance pre-
6
miums charged to drivers has become commonplace. 
7
Use of these income proxies in this fashion results 
8
in higher rates being charged to lower income driv-
9
ers while lower rates are being charged to the more 
10
affluent driver. 
11
(6) The American public is largely unaware 
12
that a person’s education level, occupation, employ-
13
ment status, home ownership status, credit score, 
14
consumer report, zip code, census tract, previous in-
15
surer, and prior purchase of insurance may be sig-
16
nificant factors used to determine eligibility for pre-
17
ferred auto insurance rates regardless of the per-
18
son’s driving history. As a result of the individual’s 
19
ineligibility for preferred rates, the driver’s policy 
20
and rate will be only offered from an affiliate com-
21
pany that has higher rates.
