A BILL 
To expand the number of scholarships available to Pakistani 
women under the Merit and Needs-Based Scholarship 
Program. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Malala Yousafzai 
4
Scholarship Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress makes the following findings: 
7
(1) In late 2008, Malala Yousafzai began mak-
8
ing the case for access to education for women and 
9
girls despite objections from the Pakistani Taliban.

On October 9, 2012, Malala was shot in the head by 
1
Pakistani Taliban on her way home from school. 
2
(2) In 2013, Malala Yousafzai and her father 
3
Ziauddin Yousafzai co-founded the Malala Fund. 
4
The Malala Fund works to secure twelve years of 
5
free, safe, and quality education for all girls. Com-
6
pletion of a full twelve-year cycle of primary and sec-
7
ondary education ensures a pipeline of girls able to 
8
pursue higher education. 
9
(3) On July 12, 2013, Malala delivered a 
10
speech before the United Nations General Assembly 
11
calling for expanded access to education for women 
12
and girls across the globe. She said, ‘‘[L]et us wage 
13
a glorious struggle against illiteracy, poverty, and 
14
terrorism. Let us pick up our books and our pens. 
15
They are the most powerful weapons . . . Education 
16
is the only solution.’’. 
17
(4) On October 10, 2014, Malala Yousafzai be-
18
came the co-recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize for 
19
her ‘‘struggle against the suppression of children 
20
and young people and for the right of all children to 
21
education’’. 
22
(5) According to the United Nations 2016 
23
Global Education Monitoring Report, more than 130 
24
million girls worldwide are out of school. 15 million 
25

girls of primary-school age will never enter a class-
1
room. As of 2016, at least 500 million adult women 
2
across the globe are illiterate. 
3
(6) According to the World Bank, ‘‘Girls’ edu-
4
cation is a strategic development priority. Better 
5
educated women tend to be healthier, participate 
6
more in the formal labor market, earn higher in-
7
comes, . . . marry at a later age, and enable better 
8
health care and education for their children, should 
9
they choose to become mothers. All these factors 
10
combined can help lift households, communities, and 
11
nations out of poverty.’’. 
12
(7) In 2015, all United Nations Member States, 
13
including the United States, adopted quality edu-
14
cation, including access to higher education, and 
15
gender equality as sustainable development goals to 
16
be attained by 2030. One of the education goal tar-
17
gets is to ‘‘ensure equal access for all women and 
18
men to affordable and quality technical, vocational 
19
and tertiary education, including university’’. 
20
(8) In January 2010, Secretary of State Hillary 
21
Rodham Clinton stated, ‘‘We will open the doors of 
22
education to all citizens, but especially to girls and 
23
women . . . We are doing all of these things because 
24
we have seen that when women and girls have the

tools to stay healthy and the opportunity to con-
1
tribute to their families’’ well-being, they flourish 
2
and so do the people around them.

(9) In February 2019, the White House 
4
launched the Women’s Global Development and 
5
Prosperity Initiative to advance women’s economic 
6
empowerment across the globe and reach more than 
7
100,000 women. 
8
(10) The World Economic Forum ranks Paki-
9
stan the second lowest among all countries in the 
10
world evaluated for gender equality. On educational 
11
attainment for women, Pakistan is ranked the tenth 
12
lowest. 
13
(11) In Pakistan, the rate of higher education 
14
enrollment beyond high school for girls and women 
15
is just 9 percent as reported by the World Bank. 
16
The global rate is 40 percent. Less than 6 percent 
17
of women 25 and older in Pakistan attain a bach-
18
elor’s degree or equivalent as of 2016. 
19
(12) According to the World Bank, ‘‘Higher 
20
education benefits both individuals and society. Eco-
21
nomic returns for college graduates are the highest 
22
in the entire educational system—an average 17 per-
23
cent increase in earnings per year of schooling as 
24
compared with 10 percent for primary school.’’.

(13) The United States provides critical foreign 
1
assistance to Pakistan’s education sector to improve 
2
access to and the quality of basic and higher edu-
3
cation. Since 2010, the United States Agency for 
4
International Development (referred to in this Act 
5
as ‘‘USAID’’) has awarded more than 6,000 scholar-
6
ships for young women to receive higher education 
7
in Pakistan. 
8
(14) The Merit and Needs-Based Scholarship 
9
Program administered by USAID awards scholar-
10
ships to academically talented, financially needy 
11
Pakistani students from all regions, including female 
12

14
stani universities.
