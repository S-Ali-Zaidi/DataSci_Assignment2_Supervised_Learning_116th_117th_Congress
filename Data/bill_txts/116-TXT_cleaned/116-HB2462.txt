5
OWNER EMPOWERMENT PILOT PROGRAM. 
6
(a) IN GENERAL.—The Administrator of the Federal 
7
Emergency Management Agency shall carry out a pilot 
8
program to make grants to units of local government to 
9
enhance the mapping of urban flooding and associated 
10
property damage and the availability of such mapped data 
11
to homeowners, businesses, and units of local government 
12
to enable them to minimize the risk of such flooding. 
13
(b) OBJECTIVES.—Amounts from grants made under 
14
the pilot program under this section may be used only to 
15
carry out activities to meet the following objectives: 
16
(1) To develop a methodology for assessing 
17
urban flood risk through the deployment of tech-
18
nology-based mapping tools that are easily under-
19
standable by the public and effectively convey infor-
20
mation regarding the level of flood risk. 
21
(2) To provide structure-specific projections of 
22
annual chance flood frequency. 
23
(3) To provide structure-based flood-risk assess-
24
ments.

(5) To incorporate information regarding cli-
3
mate trends into urban flooding risk assessments.

(l) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Congress 
12
that, because the pilot program is limited with respect to 
13
scope and resources, communities that participate in the

efforts to mitigate the effects of urban flooding— 
16
(1) take a structural-based mitigation approach 
17
with respect to construction, which includes— 
18
(A) recognizing any post-storm damage 
19
that may occur; and 
20
(B) pursuing designs that proactively mini-
21
mize future flood damage; 
22
(2) make individuals in the community aware, 
23
through any cost-effective and available means of 
24
education, of the best approaches regarding the con-
25

H2462
11 
•HR 2462 IH
struction of properties that are able to survive 
1
floods, which reduces the cost of future repairs; and 
2
(3) encourage home and property owners to 
3
consider the measures described in paragraphs (1) 
4
and (2), which are the most cost-effective and pru-
5
dent ways to reduce the impact of flooding, when 
6
constructing or renovating building components.
