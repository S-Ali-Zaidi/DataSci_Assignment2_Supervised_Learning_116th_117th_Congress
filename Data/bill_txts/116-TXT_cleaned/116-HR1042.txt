RESOLUTION 
Calling on the Senate to rename the Russell Senate Office 
Building. 
Whereas Senator Richard B. Russell opposed civil rights as 
‘‘unconstitutional and unwise’’; 
Whereas in 1935, Senator Russell participated in his first fil-
ibuster of a civil rights bill, when he and his colleagues 
in the Senate stopped an anti-lynching bill with 6 days 
of nonstop talking; 
Whereas in 1936, Senator Russell stated in a re-election cam-
paign speech that ‘‘as one who was born and reared in 
the atmosphere of the Old South, with six generations of 
my forebears now resting beneath Southern soil, I am

serve and insure White supremacy in the social, eco-
nomic, and political life of our state as any man who lives 
within her borders’’; 
Whereas in 1956, Senator Russell wrote an initial draft of 
the Southern Manifesto, the bicameral resolution stating 
support for segregation and refusal to observe Brown v. 
Board of Education; 
Whereas, because President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the 
Civil Rights Act of 1964, Senator Russell, along with 
more than a dozen other Senators, including Herman 
Talmadge, boycotted the 1964 Democratic National Con-
vention in Atlantic City; 
Whereas, on March 17, 1964, the New York Times published 
an article entitled, ‘‘Relocate Negroes Evenly in States’’, 
in which Senator Russell proposed a voluntary ‘‘racial re-
location’’ program to adjust the imbalance of the African- 
American population between the 11 States of the old 
Confederacy and the rest of the Union; 
Whereas in 1972, shortly after Senator Russell’s death, the 
Senate voted in an overwhelming majority (99–1) that 
the Old Senate Office Building be named the Russell 
Senate Office Building; 
Whereas historian Gilbert C. Fite wrote at the conclusion of 
his biography of Senator Russell, ‘‘White supremacy and 
racial segregation were to him cardinal principles for 
good and workable human relationships’’; and 
Whereas Public Law 115–58, a joint resolution signed into 
law on September 14, 2017, rejects ‘‘White nationalism, 
White supremacy, and neoNazism’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
