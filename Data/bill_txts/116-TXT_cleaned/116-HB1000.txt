1
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The Federal Government has established 
3
the achievement of full employment as a national 
4
goal in the Employment Act of 1946 and the Full 
5
Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978. 
6

•HR 1000 IH
(2) Consistent with this goal and pursuant to 
1
these Acts, the Congress has declared it to be the 
2
continuing policy and responsibility of the Federal 
3
Government to use all practicable means to create 
4
and maintain conditions which promote useful em-
5
ployment opportunities for all who seek them, in-
6
cluding the self-employed. 
7
(3) Consistent with this goal and pursuant to 
8
these Acts, the Congress has also declared and es-
9
tablished as a national goal the fulfillment of the 
10
right to full opportunities for useful paid employ-
11
ment at fair rates of compensation of all individuals 
12
able, willing, and seeking to work. 
13
(4) The United States also has a duty under 
14
Articles 55 and 56 of the United Nations Charter to 
15
promote ‘‘full employment’’ and the ‘‘universal re-
16
spect for, and observance of, human rights and fun-
17
damental freedoms for all without distinction as to 
18
race, sex, language, or religion’’. 
19
(5) The human rights the United States has a 
20
duty to promote pursuant to this obligation are set 
21
forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
22
(6) Article 23 of the Universal Declaration of 
23
Human Rights states that ‘‘Everyone has the right 
24
to work’’ and to ‘‘just and favorable remuneration’’ 
25

•HR 1000 IH
that insures for his or her family ‘‘an existence wor-
1
thy of human dignity, and supplemented, if nec-
2
essary, by other means of social protection’’. 
3
(7) Consistent with the purpose and intent of 
4
the Employment Act of 1946, the Full Employment 
5
and Balanced Growth Act of 1978, Articles 55 and 
6
56 of the United Nations Charter, and Article 23 of 
7
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the 
8
Congress recognizes and declares that the meaning 
9
of full employment under both United States and 
10
international law is synonymous with the realization 
11
of the right to work. 
12
(8) Consistent with this understanding of the 
13
meaning of full employment, the stated policy of the 
14
United States with respect to the achievement of full 
15
employment and the realization of the right to work, 
16
and the obligations of the United States under inter-
17
national law, the Full Employment and Balanced 
18
Growth Act of 1978 established an interim 5-year 
19
target of 3 percent unemployment for individuals 20 
20
years of age and older, and 4 percent for individuals 
21
age 16 and over within 5 years, with full employ-
22
ment to be achieved ‘‘as soon as practicable’’ there-
23
after.

•HR 1000 IH
(9) Notwithstanding the targets set forth in the 
1
Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 
2
1978, the United States continues to suffer substan-
3
tial unemployment and underemployment across all 
4
phases of the business cycle, including periods when 
5
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Sys-
6
tem is pursuing policies that may be useful in con-
7
trolling inflation but whose necessary consequence is 
8
the continuation of a level of unemployment and 
9
underemployment that is inconsistent with the 
10
achievement of full employment and the realization 
11
of the right to work. 
12
(10) The Federal Government’s failure to de-
13
velop and implement policies capable of reconciling 
14
the need to control inflation with its obligation to 
15
achieve full employment and secure the right to 
16
work imposes numerous economic and social costs on 
17
the Nation, the following among them: 
18
(A) The Nation is deprived of the full sup-
19
ply of goods and services and related increases 
20
in economic well-being that would occur under 
21
conditions of genuine full employment. 
22
(B) The Nation’s depressed output of 
23
goods and services, especially in the public sec-
24
tor, is insufficient to meet pressing national 
25
19:31 Feb 19, 2019

•HR 1000 IH
needs for infrastructure investment and mainte-
1
nance, public transportation, clean energy pro-
2
duction, low and moderate income housing, edu-
3
cation, health care, child and elder care, and 
4
many other public goods and human services. 
5
(C) Unemployment and underemployment 
6
expose many workers and families to signifi-
7
cant, social, psychological, and physiological 
8
costs, including disruption of family life, the 
9
loss of individual dignity and self-respect, and 
10
the aggravation of physical and mental ill-
11
nesses. 
12
(D) Persisting unemployment and under-
13
employment have devastating financial con-
14
sequences for its victims, resulting in the loss of 
15
income and spending power for families, and 
16
interfering with their ability to save and accu-
17
mulate assets for a secure family life and retire-
18
ment. 
19
(E) Because disadvantaged population 
20
groups suffer the burdens and harmful con-
21
sequences of unemployment with greater fre-
22
quency and at higher levels than nondisadvan-
23
taged population groups, unemployment pre-
24
sents a virtually insurmountable barrier to the 
25

7 
•HR 1000 IH
achievement of equal opportunity for all Ameri-
1
cans. 
2
(F) Exceptionally high levels of unemploy-
3
ment among the Nation’s youth are particularly 
4
harmful because of their long-term negative ef-
5
fects. 
6
(G) High levels of unemployment and inad-
7
equate consumer demand also contribute to 
8
poor conditions for retail businesses, manufac-
9
turers, and many other firms to grow and pros-
10
per. 
11
(H) In the real estate sector, the Congress 
12
finds that high levels of unemployment con-
13
tribute to foreclosures, evictions, and commer-
14
cial vacancies, thereby undermining the quality 
15
of neighborhood and community life, and ham-
16
pering prospects for the economic development 
17
of all the Nation’s neighborhoods and commu-
18
nities. 
19
(11) Since the historic promise of the Employ-
20
ment Act of 1946 and the Full Employment and 
21
Balanced Growth Act of 1978 has not been realized, 
22
the Congress declares and reaffirms the Federal 
23
Government’s obligation to insure the availability of 
24
decent jobs for all at living wages. 
25
19:31 Feb 19, 2019

•HR 1000 IH
(12) The Congress further declares and reaf-
1
firms that the elimination of job disparities among 
2
groups of workers who experience chronically higher 
3
rates of unemployment and underemployment is an 
4
essential component of the Federal Government’s 
5
commitment to the achievement of full employment 
6
and the realization of the right to work. 
7
(13) The Congress also finds that both job va-
8
cancy surveys and historic experience shows that 
9
even at the top of the business cycle, when the na-
10
tional unemployment rate drops to the 4 percent or 
11
below, the economy fails to provide enough jobs to 
12
employ everyone who wants to work. Consequently, 
13
the need for direct job creation by the Federal Gov-
14
ernment is especially important at such times to 
15
close the economy’s job gap without adding signifi-
16
cantly to inflationary pressures, a goal it is virtually 
17
impossible to achieve with economic policies directed 
18
at boosting production in the private sector of the 
19
economy. 
20
(14) The Congress further finds that in addi-
21
tion to providing a non-inflationary pathway for the 
22
achievement of full employment and the realization 
23
of the right to work, the direct job-creation strategy, 
24
conceived and tested by the Federal Government 
25
19:31 Feb 19, 2019
H1000
9 
•HR 1000 IH
during the New Deal era, would also reduce the se-
1
verity of recessions while enriching the Nation with 
2
a substantial increase in the production of badly 
3
needed public goods and services. 
4
(15) The Congress further finds that because of 
5
the broad range of social costs the problem of unem-
6
ployment imposes on society, including in particular 
7
reduced tax collections and increased social welfare 
8
expenditures by all levels of government, the achieve-
9
ment of full employment and the realization of the 
10
right to work by means of the New Deal’s direct job 
11
creation strategy would cost far less than other 
12
major social welfare benefits provided by government 
13
and might even end up saving the public money. 
14
(16) Therefore, while the Congress fully sup-
15
ports efforts to maximize the creation of private, 
16
public, and nonprofit sector jobs through improved 
17
use of general economic and structural policies, it 
18
recognizes and affirms the need to supplement those 
19
policies with a well-designed direct job creation pro-
20
gram committed to and capable of closing the econo-
21
my’s job gap across all phases of the business cycle. 
22
(b) PURPOSE.—It is the purpose of the Jobs for All

Act to achieve genuine full employment and fulfill the

Full Employment Trust Fund to pay for a national pro-
2

these goals by supplementing the employment opportuni-
4
