The sense of Congress is the following: 
5
(1) The Community Development Financial In-
6
stitutions Fund (the ‘‘CDFI Fund’’) is an agency of 
7
the Department of the Treasury, and was estab-
8
lished by the Riegle Community Development and 
9
Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994. The mission 
10
of the CDFI Fund is ‘‘to expand economic oppor-
11
tunity for underserved people and communities by 
12
supporting the growth and capacity of a national 
13
network of community development lenders, inves-
14
tors, and financial service providers’’. A community 
15
development financial institution (a ‘‘CDFI’’) is a

specialized financial institution serving low-income 
1
communities and a Community Development Entity 
2
(a ‘‘CDE’’) is a domestic corporation or partnership 
3
that is an intermediary vehicle for the provision of 
4
loans, investments, or financial counseling in low-in-
5
come communities. The CDFI Fund certifies CDFIs 
6
and CDEs. Becoming a certified CDFI or CDE al-
7
lows organizations to participate in various CDFI 
8
Fund programs as follows: 
9
(A) The Bank Enterprise Award Program, 
10
which provides FDIC-insured depository institu-
11
tions awards for a demonstrated increase in 
12
lending and investments in distressed commu-
13
nities and CDFIs. 
14
(B) The CDFI Program, which provides 
15
Financial and Technical Assistance awards to 
16
CDFIs to reinvest in the CDFI, and to build 
17
the capacity of the CDFI, including financing 
18
product development and loan loss reserves. 
19
(C) The Native American CDFI Assistance 
20
Program, which provides CDFIs and spon-
21
soring entities Financial and Technical Assist-
22
ance awards to increase lending and grow the 
23
number of CDFIs owned by Native Americans 
24
to help build capacity of such CDFIs.

(D) The New Market Tax Credit Program, 
1
which provides tax credits for making equity in-
2
vestments in CDEs that stimulate capital in-
3
vestments in low-income communities. 
4
(E) The Capital Magnet Fund, which pro-
5
vides awards to CDFIs and nonprofit affordable 
6
housing organizations to finance affordable 
7
housing solutions and related economic develop-
8
ment activities. 
9
(F) The Bond Guarantee Program, a 
10
source of long-term, patient capital for CDFIs 
11
to expand lending and investment capacity for 
12
community and economic development purposes. 
13
(2) The Department of the Treasury is author-
14
ized to create multi-year grant programs designed to 
15
encourage low-to-moderate income individuals to es-
16
tablish accounts at federally insured banks, and to 
17
improve low-to-moderate income individuals’ access 
18
to such accounts on reasonable terms. 
19
(3) Under this authority, grants to participants 
20
in CDFI Fund programs may be used for loan-loss 
21
reserves and to establish small-dollar loan programs 
22
by subsidizing related losses. These grants also allow 
23
for the providing recipients with the financial coun-
24
seling and education necessary to conduct trans-

actions and manage their accounts. These loans pro-
1
vide low-cost alternatives to payday loans and other 
2
nontraditional forms of financing that often impose 
3
excessive interest rates and fees on borrowers, and 
4
lead millions of Americans to fall into debt traps. 
5
Small-dollar loans can only be made pursuant to 
6
terms, conditions, and practices that are reasonable 
7
for the individual consumer obtaining the loan. 
8
(4) Program participation is restricted to eligi-
9
ble institutions, which are limited to organizations 
10
listed in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue 
11
Code and exempt from tax under 501(a) of such 
12
Code, federally insured depository institutions, com-
13
munity development financial institutions and State, 
14
local, or Tribal government entities. 
15
(5) Since its founding, the CDFI Fund has 
16
awarded over $3,300,000,000 to CDFIs and CDEs, 
17
allocated $54,000,000,000 in tax credits, and 
18
$1,510,000,000 in bond guarantees. According to 
19
the CDFI Fund, some programs attract as much as 
20
$10 in private capital for every $1 invested by the 
21
CDFI Fund. The Administration and the Congress 
22
should prioritize appropriation of funds for the loan
