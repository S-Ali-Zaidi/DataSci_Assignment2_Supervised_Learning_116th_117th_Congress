SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
1
The Congress finds as follows: 
2
(1) The population of racial and ethnic minori-
3
ties is expected to increase over the next few dec-
4
ades, yet racial and ethnic minorities have the poor-
5
est health status and face substantial cultural, so-
6
cial, and economic barriers to obtaining quality 
7
health care. 
8
(2) Health disparities are a function of not only 
9
access to health care, but also the social deter-
10
minants of health—including the environment, the 
11
physical structure of communities, nutrition and 
12
food options, educational attainment, employment, 
13
race, ethnicity, sex, geography, language preference, 
14
immigrant or citizenship status, sexual orientation, 
15
gender identity, socioeconomic status, or disability 
16
status—that directly and indirectly affect the health, 
17
health care, and wellness of individuals and commu-
18
nities. 
19
(3) Over the next few decades, the United 
20
States will face a shortage of health care providers 
21
and allied health workers. 
22
(4) All efforts to reduce health disparities and 
23
barriers to quality health services require better and 
24
more consistent data, and better and more con-
25
sistent collection of and access to data.

•HR 6637 IH
(5) A full range of culturally and linguistically 
1
appropriate health care and public health services 
2
must be available and accessible in every community. 
3
(6) Racial and ethnic minorities and under-
4
served populations must be included early and equi-
5
tably in health reform innovations. 
6
(7) Efforts to improve minority health have 
7
been limited by inadequate resources in funding, 
8
staffing, stewardship, and accountability. Targeted 
9
investments that are focused on disparities elimi-
10
nation must be made in providing care and services 
11
that are community-based, including prevention and 
12
policies addressing social determinants of health. 
13
(8) In 2011, the Department of Health and 
14
Human Services developed the HHS Action Plan to 
15
Reduce Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities and 
16
the National Stakeholder Strategy for Achieving 
17
Health Equity, which are 2 strategic plans that rep-
18
resent the first coordinated roadmap in the United 
19
States to reducing health disparities. These com-
20
prehensive plans, along with the National Prevention 
21

2012 National Healthcare Quality and Disparities 
2
Reports, will work to increase the number of people 
3
in the United States who are healthy at every stage 
4
of life. 
5
(9) The Secretary of Health and Human Serv-
6
ices has also reviewed and advanced updated clinical 
7
guidelines and developed other strategic planning 
8
documents to combat health disparities with a high 
9
impact on minority populations and to provide high- 
10
quality family planning services. Such guidelines and 
11
documents include the National HIV/AIDS Strategy, 
12
the Action Plan for the Prevention, Care, and Treat-
13
ment of Viral Hepatitis, and recommendations of the 
14
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the 
15
Office of Population Affairs.

17
Care Act (Public Law 111–148), as amended by the 
18
Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (Pub-
19

section 3400 of the Public Health Service Act, as added 
15
by section 204, shall apply.

(b) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
17
(1) Effective communication is essential to 
18
meaningful access to quality physical and mental 
19
health care. 
20
(2) Research indicates that the lack of appro-
21
priate language services creates language barriers 
22
that result in increased risk of misdiagnosis, ineffec-
23
tive treatment plans, and poor health outcomes for 
24
individuals with limited English proficiency and indi-

viduals with communication disabilities such as cog-
1
nitive, hearing, vision, or print impairments. 
2
(3) The number of limited English speaking 
3
residents in the United States who speak English 
4
less than very well and, therefore, cannot effectively 
5
communicate with health and social service providers 
6
continues to increase significantly. 
7
(4) The responsibility to fund language services 
8
in the provision of health care and health-care-re-
9
lated services to individuals with limited English 
10
proficiency and individuals with communication dis-
11
abilities such as cognitive hearing, vision, or print 
12
impairments is a societal one that cannot fairly be 
13
placed solely upon the health care, public health, or 
14
social services community. 
15
(5) Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 
16
U.S.C. 2000d et seq.) prohibits discrimination based 
17
on the grounds of race, color, or national origin by 
18
any entity receiving Federal financial assistance. In 
19
order to avoid discrimination on the grounds of na-
20
tional origin, all programs or activities administered 
21
by the Federal Government must take adequate 
22
steps to ensure that their policies and procedures do 
23

1
benefits and services for which such persons qualify. 
2
(6) Both the Americans with Disabilities Act of 
3
1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.) and the Rehabilita-
4
tion Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 701 et seq.) prohibit 
5
discrimination on the basis of disability and require 
6
the provision of appropriate auxiliary aids and serv-
7
ices necessary to ensure effective communication 
8
with individuals with disabilities. The type of auxil-
9
iary aid or service necessary to ensure effective com-
10
munication will vary in accordance with the method 
11
of communication used by the individual; the nature, 
12
length, and complexity of the communication in-
13
volved; and the context in which the communication 
14
is taking place. A public accommodation should con-
15
sult with individuals with disabilities whenever pos-
16
sible to determine what type of auxiliary aid is need-
17
ed to ensure effective communication. The public ac-
18
commodation should use the person’s preferred 
19
method of communication whenever possible, unless 
20
it would be an undue burden to the public accommo-
21
dation and an alternative would provide an equally 
22
effective means of communication. The ultimate de-
23
cision as to what measures to take rests with the

that the United States population will grow from 
5
321 million in 2015 to 347 million in 2025. Further, 
6
the number of Medicare beneficiaries is estimated to 
7
increase from 47,800,000 in 2015 to approximately 
8
66,000,000 in 2025.

(4) Approximately 36 percent of practicing phy-
10
sicians are over the age of 55 and are likely to retire 
11
within the next decade. 
12
(5) A nationwide physician shortage will result 
13
in many people in the United States waiting longer 
14
and traveling farther for health care; seeking non-
15
emergent care in emergency departments; and delay-
16
ing treatment until their health care needs become 
17
more serious, complex, and costly. 
18
(6) Changing demographics (such as an aging 
19
population), new health care delivery models (such 
20
as medical homes), and other factors (such as dis-
21
aster preparedness) are contributing to a shortage of 
22
both generalist and specialist physicians.

including racial and ethnic minorities and the ap-
1
proximately 20 percent of people in the United 
2

3
ignated as health professional shortage areas. 
4
(8) The health care utilization equity model of 
5
the Association of American Medical Colleges esti-
6
mates that if racial and ethnic minorities and indi-
7
viduals from rural areas utilized health care in a 
8
similar way to their Caucasian counterparts living in 
9
metropolitan areas, the physician shortage would re-
10
quire an additional 96,000 physicians. 
11
(9) To address the physician shortage in rural 
12
and medically underserved areas, medical education 
13
and training need to be accessible to underrep-
14
resented minorities (African American, Hispanic, 
15
Native American, and Native Hawaiian), and need 
16
to increase pathway programs for underrepresented 
17
minorities who make up less than 12 percent as well 
18
as for international medical graduates who make up 
19
25 percent of graduate medical education. Immigra-
20
tion pathways like student, exchange-visitor, and em-
21
ployment visas, and programs like the National In-
22
terest Waiver and Conrad 30 J–1 Visa Waiver, help 
23
improve health access across the United States.

(10) United States medical school enrollment

will grow by 30 percent from 2018 to 2019 to help 
2
reduce the shortage of quality physicians in the

United States. 
4
(11) An increase in United States medical 
5
school graduates must be accompanied by an in-
6
crease of 4,000 graduate medical education training 
7
positions each year. 
8
(12) Graduate medical education programs and 
9
teaching hospitals provide venues in which the next 
10
generation of physicians learns to work collabo-
11
ratively with other physicians and health profes-
12
sionals, adopt more efficient care delivery models 
13
(such as care coordination and medical homes), in-
14
corporate health information technology and elec-

(13) The Medicare program under title XVIII 
20
of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.) 
21
(having more beneficiaries than any other health 
22
care program), supports its ‘‘fair share’’ of the costs

medical education by the Medicare program has 
2
been capped since 1997 and has not been increased

to support the expansion of graduate medical edu-

cation programs needed to avert the projected physi-

(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-

gress that eliminating the limit of the number of residency 
9
positions that receive some level of Medicare support 
10
under section 1886(h) of the Social Security Act (42 
11
U.S.C. 1395ww(h)), also referred to as the Medical grad-
12
uate medical education cap, is critical to— 
13
(1) ensuring an appropriate supply of physi-
14
cians to meet the health care needs in the United 
15
States; 
16
(2) facilitating equitable access for all who seek 
17
health care; and

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
23
(1) According to the Association of Schools and 
24
Programs of Public Health, projections indicate a 
25
23:08 Jul 08, 2020
H6637
195 
•HR 6637 IH
nationwide shortage of up to 250,000 public health 
1
workers needed by 2020. 
2
(2) Similar trends are projected for other health 
3
professions indicating shortages across disciplines, 
4
including within the fields of nursing (500,000 by 
5
2025), dentistry (15,000 by 2025), pharmacy 
6
(38,000 by 2030), mental and behavioral health, pri-
7
mary care (46,000 by 2025), and community and al-
8
lied health. 
9
(3) A nationwide health workforce shortage will 
10
result in serious health threats and more severe and 
11
costly health care needs, due to, in part, a delayed 
12
response to food-borne outbreaks, emerging infec-
13
tious diseases, natural disasters, fewer cancer 
14
screenings, and delayed treatment. 
15
(4) Vulnerable and underserved populations and 
16
health professional shortage areas will be most se-
17
verely impacted by the health workforce shortage. 
18
(5) According to the Migration Policy Institute, 
19
more than 2,000,000 college-educated immigrants in 
20
the United States today are unemployed or under-
21
employed in low- or semi-skilled jobs that fail to 
22
draw on their education and expertise.

for Labor Markets and Policy, underemployment for 
5
internationally educated immigrant women is 28 per-
6
cent higher than for their male counterparts.

(8) According to the Drexel University Center 
8
for Labor Markets and Policy, the mean annual 
9
earnings 
of 
underemployed 
immigrants 
were 
10
$32,000, or 43 percent less than United States born 
11
college graduates employed in the college labor mar-
12
ket. 
13
(9) According to Upwardly Global and the Wel-
14
come Back Initiative, with proper guidance and sup-
15
port, underemployed skilled immigrants typically in-
16
crease their income by 215 percent to 900 percent. 
17
(10) According to the Brookings Institution and 
18
the Partnership for a New American Economy, im-
19
migrants working in the health workforce are, on av-
20
erage, better educated than United States-born

10
for the volume of services provided to the value the

(2) high-value care is care that provides higher- 
13
quality care more efficiently, achieving greater 
14
health improvement and better health outcomes at 
15
lower cost (per patient and overall);

(3) a high-value health care system must deliver

This subtitle may be cited as the ‘‘Health Empower-

12
SEC. 452. FINDINGS. 
13
Congress finds the following: 
14
(1) Numerous studies and reports, including 
15
the 2015 National Healthcare Quality and Dispari-
16
ties Report of the Agency for Healthcare Research 
17
and Quality and the 2002 report of the Institute of 
18
Medicine entitled ‘‘Unequal Treatment: Confronting 
19
Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Care’’, doc-
20
ument the extensiveness to which health disparities 
21
exist across the country. 
22
(2) These studies have found that, on average, 
23
racial and ethnic minorities are disproportionately 
24
afflicted with chronic and acute conditions—such as 
25
23:08 Jul 08, 2020
H6637
351 
•HR 6637 IH
cancer, diabetes, musculoskeletal disease, obesity, 
1
and hypertension—and suffer worse health out-
2
comes, worse health status, and higher mortality 
3
rates than their White counterparts. 
4
(3) Several recent studies also show that health 
5
disparities are a function of not only access to health 
6
care, but also the social determinants of health—in-
7
cluding the environment, the physical structure of 
8
communities, nutrition and food options, educational 
9
attainment and health literacy, employment, race, 
10
ethnicity, immigration status, geography, and lan-
11
guage preference—that directly and indirectly affect 
12
the health, health care, and wellness of individuals 
13
and communities. 
14
(4) Integrally involving and fully supporting the 
15
communities most affected by health inequities in 
16
the assessment, planning, launch, and evaluation of 
17
health disparity elimination efforts are among the 
18
leading recommendations made to adequately ad-
19
dress and ultimately reduce health disparities. 
20
(5) Recommendations also include supporting 
21
the efforts of community stakeholders from a broad 
22
cross section—including local businesses, local de-
23
partments of commerce, education, labor, urban 
24
planning, and transportation, and community-based

(b) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
10
(1) Every year, across the United States, 
11
4,000,000 women give birth, about 700 women suf-
12
fer fatal complications during pregnancy, while giv-
13
ing birth or during the postpartum period, and 
14
70,000 women suffer near-fatal, partum-related 
15
complications. 
16
(2) The maternal mortality rate is often used as 
17
a proxy to measure the overall health of a popu-
18
lation. While the infant mortality rate in the United 
19
States has reached its lowest point, the risk of death 
20
for women in the United States during pregnancy, 
21
childbirth, or the postpartum period is higher than 
22
such risk in many other developed nations. The esti-
23
mated maternal mortality rate (per 100,000 live 
24
births) for the 48 contiguous States and Wash-
25

ington, DC, increased from 18.8 percent in 2000 to 
1
23.8 percent in 2014 to 26.6 percent in 2018. This 
2
estimated rate is on par with such rate for under-
3
developed nations such as Iraq and Afghanistan. 
4
(3) International studies estimate the 2015 ma-
5
ternal mortality rate in the United States as 26.4 
6
per 100,000 live births, which is almost twice the 
7
2015 World Health Organization estimation of 14 
8
per 100,000 live births. 
9
(4) It is estimated that more than 60 percent 
10
of maternal deaths in the United States are prevent-
11
able. 
12
(5) According to the Centers for Disease Con-
13
trol and Prevention, the maternal mortality rate var-
14
ies drastically for women by race and ethnicity. 
15
There are 12.7 deaths per 100,000 live births for 
16
White women, 43.5 deaths per 100,000 live births 
17
for African-American women, and 14.4 deaths per 
18
100,000 live births for women of other ethnicities. 
19
While maternal mortality disparately impacts Afri-
20
can-American women, this urgent public health crisis 
21
traverses race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, edu-
22
cational background, and geography. 
23
(6) African-American women are 3 to 4 times 
24
more likely to die from causes related to pregnancy

3
through (6) are of major concern to researchers, 
4
academics, members of the business community, and 
5
providers across the obstetrical continuum rep-
6

plications. Most of these conditions are largely pre-
1
ventable or manageable. 
2
(9) Oral health is an important part of 
3
perinatal health. Reducing bacteria in a woman’s 
4
mouth during pregnancy can significantly reduce her 
5
risk of developing oral diseases and spreading decay- 
6
causing bacteria to her baby. Moreover, some evi-
7
dence suggests that women with periodontal disease 
8
during pregnancy could be at greater risk for poor 
9
birth outcomes, such as preeclampsia, pre-term 
10
birth, and low-birth weight. Furthermore, a woman’s 
11
oral health during pregnancy is a good predictor of 
12
her newborn’s oral health, and since mothers can 
13
unintentionally spread oral bacteria to their babies, 
14
putting their children at higher risk for tooth decay, 
15
prevention efforts should happen even before chil-
16
dren are born, as a matter of pre-pregnancy health 
17
and prenatal care during pregnancy. 
18
(10) The United States has not been able to 
19
submit a formal maternal mortality rate to inter-
20
national data repositories since 2007. Thus, no offi-
21
cial maternal mortality rate exists for the United 
22
States. There can be no maternal mortality rate 
23
without streamlining maternal mortality-related data

from the State level and extrapolating such data to 
1
the Federal level. 
2
(11) In the United States, death reporting and 
3
analysis is a State function rather than a Federal 
4
process. States report all deaths—including mater-
5
nal deaths—on a semi-voluntary basis, without 
6
standardization across States. While the Centers for 
7
Disease Control and Prevention has the capacity and 
8
system for collecting death-related data based on 
9
death certificates, these data are not sufficiently re-
10
ported by States in an organized and standard for-
11
mat across States such that the Centers for Disease 
12
Control and Prevention is able to identify causes of 
13
maternal death and best practices for the prevention 
14
of such death. 
15
(12) Vital statistics systems often underesti-
16
mate maternal mortality and are insufficient data 
17
sources from which to derive a full scope of medical 
18
and social determinant factors contributing to ma-
19
ternal deaths. While the addition of pregnancy 
20
checkboxes on death certificates since 2003 have 
21
likely improved States’ abilities to identify preg-
22
nancy-related deaths, they are not generally com-
23
pleted by obstetrical providers or persons trained to 
24
recognize pregnancy-related mortality. Thus, these 
25

•HR 6637 IH
vital forms may be missing information or may cap-
1
ture inconsistent data. Due to varying maternal 
2
mortality-related analyses, lack of reliability, and 
3
granularity in data, current maternal mortality 
4
informatics do not fully encapsulate the myriad med-
5
ical and socially determinant factors that contribute 
6
to such high maternal mortality rates within the 
7
United States compared to other developed nations. 
8
Lack of standardization of data and data sharing 
9
across States and between Federal entities, health 
10
networks, and research institutions keep the Nation 
11
in the dark about ways to prevent maternal deaths. 
12
(13) Having reliable and valid State data ag-
13
gregated at the Federal level is critical to the Na-
14
tion’s ability to quell surges in maternal death and 
15
imperative for researchers to identify long-lasting 
16
interventions. 
17
(14) Leaders in maternal wellness highly rec-
18
ommend that maternal deaths be investigated at the 
19
State level first, and that standardized, streamlined, 
20
de-identified data regarding maternal deaths be sent 
21
annually to the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
22
vention. Such data standardization and collection 
23
would be similar in operation and effect to the Na-
24

for Disease Control and Prevention and akin to the 
1
Confidential Enquiry in Maternal Deaths Pro-
2
gramme in the United Kingdom. Such a maternal 
3
mortalities and morbidities registry and surveillance 
4
system would help providers, academicians, law-
5
makers, and the public to address questions con-
6
cerning the types of, causes of, and best practices to 
7
thwart, pregnancy-related or pregnancy-associated 
8
mortality and morbidity. 
9
(15) The United Nations Millennium Develop-
10
ment Goal 5a aimed to reduce by 75 percent, be-
11
tween 1990 and 2015, the maternal mortality rate, 
12
yet this metric has not been achieved. In fact, the 
13
maternal mortality rate in the United States has 
14
been estimated to have more than doubled between 
15
2000 and 2014. Yet, because national data are not 
16
fully available, the United States does not have an 
17
official maternal mortality rate. 
18
(16) Many States have struggled to establish or 
19
maintain Maternal Mortality Review Committees 
20
(referred to in this section as ‘‘MMRC’’). On the 
21
State level, MMRCs have lagged because States have 
22
not had the resources to mount local reviews. State- 
23
level reviews are necessary as only the State depart-
24
ments of health have the authority to request med-
25
23:08 Jul 08, 2020

386 
•HR 6637 IH
ical records, autopsy reports, and police reports crit-
1
ical to the function of the MMRC. 
2
(17) The United Kingdom regards maternal 
3
deaths as a health systems failure and a national 
4
committee of obstetrics experts review each maternal 
5
death or near-fatal childbirth complication. Such 
6
committee also establishes the predominant course of 
7
maternal-related deaths from conditions such as 
8
preeclampsia. Consequently, the United Kingdom 
9
has been able to reduce its incidence of preeclampsia 
10
to less than one in 10,000 women—its lowest rate 
11
since 1952. 
12
(18) The United States has no comparable, co-
13
ordinated Federal process by which to review cases 
14
of maternal mortality, systems failures, or best prac-
15
tices. Many States have active MMRCs and leverage 
16
their work to impact maternal wellness. For exam-
17
ple, the State of California has worked extensively 
18
with their State health departments, health and hos-
19
pital systems, and research collaborative organiza-
20
tions, including the California Maternal Quality Care 
21
Collaborative and the Alliance for Innovation on Ma-
22
ternal Health, to establish MMRCs, wherein such 
23
State has determined the most prevalent causes of 
24
maternal mortality and recorded and shared data 
25
23:08 Jul 08, 2020
H6637

•HR 6637 IH
with providers and researchers, who have developed 
1
and implemented safety bundles and care protocols 
2
related to preeclampsia, maternal hemorrhage, and 
3
the like. In this way, the State of California has 
4
been able to leverage its maternal mortality review 
5
board system, generate data, and apply those data 
6
to effect changes in maternal care-related protocol. 
7
To date, the State of California has reduced its ma-
8
ternal mortality rate, which is now comparable to 
9
the low rates of the United Kingdom. 
10
(19) Hospitals and health systems across the 
11
United States lack standardization of emergency ob-
12
stetrical protocols before, during, and after delivery. 
13
Consequently, many providers are delayed in recog-
14
nizing critical signs indicating maternal distress that 
15
quickly escalate into fatal or near-fatal incidences. 
16
Moreover, any attempt to address an obstetrical 
17
emergency that does not consider both clinical and 
18
public health approaches falls woefully under the 
19
mark of excellent care delivery. State-based maternal 
20
quality collaborative organizations, such as the Cali-
21
fornia Maternal Quality Care Collaborative or enti-
22
ties participating in the Alliance for Innovation on 
23
Maternal Health (AIM), have formed obstetrical pro-
24
tocols, tool kits, and other resources to improve sys-

tem care and response as they relate to maternal 
1
complications and warning signs for such conditions 
2
as 
maternal 
hemorrhage, 
hypertension, 
and 
3
preeclampsia. 
4
(20) The Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
5
vention reports that nearly half of all maternal 
6
deaths occur in the immediate postpartum period— 
7
the 42 days following a pregnancy—whereas more 
8
than one-third of pregnancy-related or pregnancy-as-
9
sociated deaths occur while a person is still preg-
10
nant. Yet, for women eligible for the Medicaid pro-
11
gram on the basis of pregnancy, such Medicaid cov-
12
erage lapses at the end of the month on which the 
13
60th postpartum day lands. 
14
(21) The experience of serious traumatic 
15
events, such as being exposed to domestic violence, 
16
substance use disorder, or pervasive racism, can 
17
over-activate the body’s stress-response system. 
18
Known as toxic stress, the repetition of high doses 
19
of cortisol to the brain can harm healthy neuro-
20
logical development, which can have cascading phys-
21
ical and mental health consequences, as documented 
22
in the Adverse Childhood Experiences study of the 
23
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

(22) A growing body of evidence-based research 
1
has shown the correlation between the stress associ-
2
ated with one’s race—the stress of racism—and 
3
one’s birthing outcomes. The stress of sex and race 
4
discrimination and institutional racism has been 
5
demonstrated to contribute to a higher risk of ma-
6
ternal mortality, irrespective of one’s gestational 
7
age, maternal age, socioeconomic status, or indi-
8
vidual-level health risk factors, including poverty, 
9
limited access to prenatal care, and poor physical 
10
and mental health (although these are not nominal 
11
factors). African-American women remain the most 
12
at risk for pregnancy-associated or pregnancy-re-
13
lated 
causes 
of 
death. 
When 
it 
comes 
to 
14
preeclampsia, for example, which is related to obe-
15
sity, African-American women of normal weight re-
16
main the most at risk of dying during the perinatal 
17
period compared to non-African-American obese 
18
women. 
19
(23) The rising maternal mortality rate in the 
20
United States is driven predominantly by the dis-
21
proportionately high rates of African-American ma-
22
ternal mortality. 
23
(24) African-American women are 3 to 4 times 
24
more likely to die from pregnancy or maternal-re-

lated distress than are White women, yielding one of 
1
the greatest and most disconcerting racial disparities 
2
in public health. 
3
(25) Compared to women from other racial and 
4
ethnic 
demographics, 
African-American 
women 
5
across the socioeconomic spectrum experience pro-
6
longed, unrelenting stress related to racial and gen-
7
der discrimination, contributing to higher rates of 
8
maternal mortality, giving birth to low-weight ba-
9
bies, and experiencing pre-term birth. Racism is a 
10
risk factor for these aforementioned experiences. 
11
This cumulative stress often extends across the life 
12
course and is situated in everyday spaces where Afri-
13
can-American women establish livelihood. Structural 
14
barriers, lack of access to care, and genetic pre-
15
dispositions to health vulnerabilities exacerbate Afri-
16
can-American women’s likelihood to experience poor 
17
or fatal birthing outcomes, but do not fully account 
18
for the great disparity. 
19
(26) African-American women are twice as like-
20
ly to experience postpartum depression, and dis-
21
proportionately higher rates of preeclampsia com-
22
pared to White women. 
23

1
in disparate treatment for pain, irreverence for cul-
2
tural 
norms 
with 
respect 
to

and

dismissiveness. Research has demonstrated that pa-
4
tients respond more warmly and adhere to medical 
5
treatment plans at a higher degree with providers of 
6
the same race or ethnicity or with providers with 
7
great ability to exercise empathy. However, the pro-
8
vider pool is not primed with many people of color, 
9
nor are providers (whether student-doctors in train-
10
ing or licensed practitioners) consistently required to 
11
undergo implicit bias, cultural competency, or empa-
12
thy training on a consistent, on-going basis.

TITLE VI—MENTAL HEALTH 
6
SEC. 601. MENTAL HEALTH FINDINGS. 
7
Congress finds the following: 
8
(1) Despite the existence of effective treat-
9
ments, inequities lie in the availability, accessibility, 
10
and quality of mental health services for racial and 
11
ethnic minorities and people with disabilities. 
12
(2) These inequities have powerful significance 
13
for minority groups and for society as a whole. 
14
(3) Racial and ethnic minorities and people 
15
with disabilities bear a greater burden from unmet 
16
mental health needs and thus suffer a greater loss 
17
to their overall health and productivity. 
18
(4) Improving community conditions and one’s 
19
home environment, paired with high-quality, acces-
20
sible, and culturally tailored mental health services, 
21
can reduce the likelihood, frequency, and intensity of 
22
challenges to one’s mental health. 
23
(5) The presence of strong social connections 
24
and trust, opportunities to experience and share cul-
25
23:08 Jul 08, 2020
H6637
539 
•HR 6637 IH
tural identity, safe gathering places, and economic 
1
opportunity are community factors that benefit men-
2
tal health. 
3
(6) The social, physical, and economic condi-
4
tions in communities can have tremendous influence 
5
on daily stressors that shape mental health out-
6
comes. 
7
(7) The foremost barriers include the cost of 
8
care, societal stigma, and the fragmented organiza-
9
tion of services. 
10
(8) People with disabilities who are racial or 
11
ethnic minorities may have co-occurring mental 
12
health conditions which, without proper accommoda-
13
tions and support, further stigmatize them and limit 
14
their participation in society. 
15
(9) African-American, Latinx, Asian-American, 
16
Pacific Islander, Native, and other people of color 
17
have attitudes toward mental health challenges that 
18
are another barrier to seeking mental health care. 
19
(10) Mental illness retains considerable stigma 
20
in many communities of color, including those of 
21
Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, and seeking 
22
treatment is not always encouraged. 
23
(11) Addressing mental health stigma and in-
24
creasing culturally appropriate treatment modalities 
25
23:08 Jul 08, 2020
H6637
540 
•HR 6637 IH
in communities will help to increase utilization of 
1
mental health services for people who have trouble 
2
functioning because of mental health challenges. 
3
(12) There is a link between mental health di-
4
agnosis and the likelihood of an individual commit-
5
ting suicide. 
6
(13) A comprehensive public health approach to 
7
behavioral health fosters protective factors in racial 
8
and ethnic communities that support mental health. 
9
(14) Approaches to mental health and address-
10
ing trauma must keep in mind the historical and 
11
cultural trauma that has impacted many commu-
12
nities of color. 
13
(15) Treatment modalities must keep individual 
14
communities’ approaches to mental health in mind, 
15
for example— 
16
(A) cultural healing practices; and 
17
(B) the mental health professionals needed 
18
to provide those services such as peer support 
19
specialists. 
20
(16) Approaches to mental health and address-
21
ing trauma must keep in mind the concept of 
22
intersectionality of individuals; that individuals may 
23
have many inequities that shape the way they proc-
24
ess and experience everyday life.

SEC. 701. LUNG CANCER MORTALITY REDUCTION. 
13
(a) SHORT TITLE.—This section may be cited as the 
14
‘‘Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Act of 2020’’. 
15
(b) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following find-
16
ings: 
17
(1) Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer 
18
death for both men and women, accounting for 25 
19
percent of all cancer deaths. 
20
(2) Lung cancer kills more people annually 
21
than breast cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer, 
22
liver cancer, melanoma, and kidney cancer combined. 
23
(3) Since the National Cancer Act of 1971 
24
(Public Law 92–218; 85 Stat. 778), coordinated and 
25
23:08 Jul 08, 2020

•HR 6637 IH
comprehensive research has raised the 5-year sur-
1
vival rates for breast cancer to 90 percent, for pros-
2
tate cancer to 99 percent, and for colon cancer to 
3
64 percent. 
4
(4) The 5-year survival rate for lung cancer is 
5
still only 18 percent, and a similar coordinated and 
6
comprehensive research effort is required to achieve 
7
increases in lung cancer survivability rates. 
8
(5) Sixty percent of lung cancer cases are now 
9
diagnosed in nonsmokers or former smokers. 
10
(6) Two-thirds of nonsmokers diagnosed with 
11
lung cancer are women. 
12
(7) Certain minority populations, such as Afri-
13
can-American males, have disproportionately high 
14
rates of lung cancer incidence and mortality, despite 
15
their smoking rate being similar to other racial 
16
groups. 
17
(8) Members of the Baby Boomer Generation 
18
are entering their 60s, the most common age at 
19
which people develop lung cancer. 
20
(9) Tobacco addiction and exposure to other 
21
lung cancer carcinogens such as Agent Orange and 
22
other herbicides and battlefield emissions are serious 
23
problems among military personnel and war vet-
24
erans. 
25
23:08 Jul 08, 2020
H6637
589 
•HR 6637 IH
(10) Significant and rapid improvements in 
1
lung cancer mortality can be expected through great-
2
er use and access to lung cancer screening tests for 
3
at-risk individuals. 
4
(11) Recent research has shown that screening 
5
with low-dose computed tomography scan reduced 
6
lung cancer death mortality by 20 percent for those 
7
with a high risk of lung cancer through early detec-
8
tion. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 
9
supports annual lung cancer screening for high-risk 
10
patients with low-dose computed tomography. 
11
(12) Additional strategies are necessary to fur-
12
ther enhance the existing tests and therapies avail-
13
able to diagnose and treat lung cancer in the future. 
14
(13) The August 2001 Report of the Lung 
15
Cancer Progress Review Group of the National Can-
16
cer Institute stated that funding for lung cancer re-
17
search was ‘‘far below the levels characterized for 
18
other common malignancies and far out of propor-
19
tion to its massive health impact’’. 
20
(14) The Report of the Lung Cancer Progress 
21
Review Group identified as its ‘‘highest priority’’ the 
22
creation of integrated, multidisciplinary, multi-insti-
23
tutional research consortia organized around the 
24
23:08 Jul 08, 2020
H6637
590 
•HR 6637 IH
problem of lung cancer rather than around specific 
1
research disciplines. 
2
(15) The United States must enhance its re-
3
sponse to the issues raised in the Report of the 
4
Lung Cancer Progress Review Group, and this can 
5
be accomplished through the establishment of a co-
6
ordinated effort designed to reduce the lung cancer 
7
mortality rate by 50 percent by 2020 and targeted 
8
funding to support this coordinated effort. 
9
(c) SENSE OF CONGRESS CONCERNING INVESTMENT 
10
IN LUNG CANCER RESEARCH.—It is the sense of the Con-
11
gress that— 
12
(1) lung cancer mortality reduction should be 
13
made a national public health priority; and 
14
(2) a comprehensive mortality reduction pro-
15
gram coordinated by the Secretary of Health and

17
quately address and reduce lung cancer mortality.

SEC. 702. EXPANDING PROSTATE CANCER RESEARCH, OUT-

REACH, SCREENING, TESTING, ACCESS, AND

TREATMENT EFFECTIVENESS. 
3
(a) SHORT TITLE.—This section may be cited as the 
4
‘‘Prostate Research, Outreach, Screening, Testing, Access, 
5
and Treatment Effectiveness Act of 2020’’ or the ‘‘PROS-
6
TATE Act’’. 
7
(b) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following find-
8
ings: 
9
(1) Prostate cancer is the second leading cause 
10
of cancer death among men. 
11
(2) In 2018, an estimated 164,690 men will be 
12
diagnosed with prostate cancer and more than 
13
29,000 will die from this disease. 
14
(3) Roughly 2,000,000 to 3,000,000 people in 
15
the United States are living with a diagnosis of pros-
16
tate cancer and its consequences. 
17
(4) While prostate cancer generally affects older 
18
individuals, younger men are also at risk for the dis-
19
ease, and when prostate cancer appears in early 
20
middle age, it frequently takes on a more aggressive 
21
form. 
22
(5) There are significant racial and ethnic dis-
23
parities that demand attention; African Americans 
24
have prostate cancer mortality rates that are more 
25
than double those in the White population. 
26
23:08 Jul 08, 2020
H6637

•HR 6637 IH
(6) Underserved rural populations have higher 
1
rates of mortality compared to their urban counter-
2
parts, and innovative and cost-efficient methods to 
3
improve rural access to high-quality care should take 
4
advantage of advances in telehealth to diagnose and 
5
treat prostate cancer when appropriate. 
6
(7) Certain veterans populations may have 
7
nearly twice the incidence of prostate cancer as the 
8
general population of the United States. 
9
(8) Urologists may constitute the specialists 
10
who diagnose and treat the vast majority of prostate 
11
cancer patients. 
12
(9) Although much basic and translational re-
13
search has been completed and much is currently 
14
known, there are still many unanswered questions, 
15
such as the extent to which known disparities are at-
16
tributable to disease etiology, access to care, or edu-
17
cation and awareness in the community. 
18
(10) Causes of prostate cancer are not known. 
19
There is not good information regarding how to dif-
20
ferentiate accurately, early on, between aggressive 
21
and indolent forms of the disease. As a result, there 
22
is significant overtreatment in prostate cancer. 
23
There are no treatments that can durably arrest

•HR 6637 IH
growth or cure prostate cancer once it has metasta-
1
sized. 
2
(11) A significant proportion (about 23 to 54 
3
percent) of cases may be clinically indolent and 
4
‘‘overdiagnosed’’, resulting in significant overtreat-
5
ment. More accurate tests will allow men and their 
6
families to face less physical, psychological, financial, 
7
and emotional trauma, and billions of dollars could 
8
be saved in private and public health care systems 
9
in an area that has been identified by the Medicare 
10
program under title XVIII of the Social Security Act 
11
(42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.) as one of 8 high-volume, 
12
high-cost areas in the Resource Utilization Report 
13
Program established under the Medicare Improve-
14
ments for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 (Pub-
15
lic Law 110–275). 
16
(12) Prostate cancer research and health care 
17
programs across Federal agencies should be coordi-
18
nated to improve accountability and actively encour-
19
age the translation of research into practice, to iden-
20
tify and implement best practices, in order to foster

an integrated and consistent focus on effective pre-
22

(4) While it is important for men to take ad-
5
vantage of current prostate cancer screening tech-
6
niques, a recent NCI-funded study demonstrated 
7
that the most common available methods of detect-
8
ing prostate cancer (PSA blood test and physical 
9
exams) are not foolproof, causing numerous false 
10
alarms and false reassurances. 
11
(5) The absence of advanced imaging tech-
12
nologies for prostate cancer causes the lack of accu-
13
rate information critical for clinical decisions, result-
14
ing in missed cancers and lost lives, as well as un-
15
necessary and costly medical procedures, with re-
16
lated complications. 
17
(6) With prostate imaging tools, men and their 
18
families would face less physical, psychological, fi-
19
nancial and emotional trauma and billions of dollars 
20
could be saved in private and public health care sys-
21
tems.

(b) FINDINGS.—Congress finds as follows: 
24
23:08 Jul 08, 2020
H6637
645 
•HR 6637 IH
(1) Only a small percent of patients participate 
1
in cancer clinical trials, even though most express an 
2
interest in clinical research. There are several obsta-
3
cles that restrict individuals from participating in-
4
cluding lack of available local trials, restrictive eligi-
5
bility criteria, transportation to trial sites, taking 
6
time off from work, and potentially increased med-
7
ical and nonmedical costs. Ultimately, about 1 in 5 
8
cancer clinical trials fail because of lack of patient 
9
enrollment. 
10
(2) Groups that are generally underrepresented 
11
in clinical trials include racial and ethnic minorities 
12
and older, rural, and lower-income individuals. 
13
(3) Henrietta Lacks, an African-American 
14
woman, was diagnosed with cervical cancer at the 
15
age of 31, and despite receiving painful radium 
16
treatments, passed away on October 4, 1951. 
17
(4) Medical researchers took samples of Hen-
18
rietta Lacks’ tumor during her treatment and the 
19
HeLa cell line from her tumor proved remarkably 
20
resilient. 
21
(5) HeLa cells were the first immortal line of 
22
human cells. Henrietta Lacks’ cells were unique, 
23
growing by the millions, commercialized and distrib-

uted worldwide to researchers, resulting in advances 
1
in medicine. 
2
(6) Henrietta Lacks’ prolific cells continue to 
3
grow and contribute to remarkable advances in med-
4
icine, including the development of the polio vaccine, 
5
as well as drugs for treating the effects of cancer, 
6
HIV/AIDS, hemophilia, leukemia, and Parkinson’s 
7
disease. These cells have been used in research that 
8
has contributed to our understanding of the effects 
9
of radiation and zero gravity on human cells. These 
10
immortal cells have informed research on chromo-
11
somal conditions, cancer, gene mapping, and preci-
12
sion medicine. 
13
(7) Henrietta Lacks and her immortal cells 
14
have made a significant contribution to global 
15
health, scientific research, quality of life, and patient 
16
rights. 
17
(8) For more than 20 years, the advances made 
18
possible by Henrietta Lacks’ cells were without her 
19
or her family’s consent, and the revenues they gen-
20
erated were not known to or shared with her family. 
21

22
is fundamental to modern and future bioethics poli-
23

(a) SHORT TITLE.—This subtitle may be cited as the

‘‘Viral Hepatitis and Liver Cancer Control and Prevention 
21
Act of 2020’’. 
22
(b) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
23
(1) In the United States, nearly 5,000,000 per-
24
sons are living with the hepatitis B virus (referred 
25
23:08 Jul 08, 2020
H6637
649 
•HR 6637 IH
to in this section as ‘‘HBV’’) or the hepatitis C virus 
1
(referred to in this section as ‘‘HCV’’). 
2
(2) In the United States, chronic HBV and 
3
HCV are the most common causes of liver cancer, 
4
the second deadliest and fastest growing cancer in 
5
this country. Such viruses are the most common 
6
cause of chronic liver disease, liver cirrhosis, and the 
7
most common indications for liver transplantation. 
8
At least 21,000 deaths per year in the United States 
9
can be attributed to chronic HBV and HCV. Chron-
10
ic HCV is also a leading cause of death in Ameri-
11
cans living with HIV/AIDS; many of those living 
12
with HIV/AIDS are coinfected with chronic HBV, 
13
chronic HCV, or both. 
14
(3) According to the Centers for Disease Con-
15
trol and Prevention (referred to in this section as 
16
the ‘‘CDC’’), approximately 2 percent of the popu-
17
lation of the United States is living with chronic 
18
HBV, chronic HCV, or both. The CDC has recog-
19
nized HCV as the Nation’s most common chronic 
20
bloodborne virus infection and HBV as the deadliest 
21
vaccine-preventable disease. 
22
(4) HBV is transmitted through contact with 
23
infectious blood, semen, or other bodily fluids and is 
24
100 times more infectious than HIV. HCV is trans-
25
23:08 Jul 08, 2020
H6637
650 
•HR 6637 IH
mitted by contact with infectious blood, particularly 
1
through percutaneous exposures (such as puncture 
2
through the skin). 
3
(5) The CDC estimates that in 2016, more 
4
than 41,000 people in the United States were newly 
5
infected with HCV and nearly 21,000 people in the 
6
United States were newly infected with HBV. These 
7
estimates could be much higher due to many rea-
8
sons, including lack of screening education and 
9
awareness, and perceived marginalization of the pop-
10
ulations at risk. 
11
(6) In 2012, CDC released new guidelines rec-
12
ommending every person born between 1945 and 
13
1965 receive a one-time test for HCV. Among the 
14
estimated 102,000,000 (1,600,000 chronically HCV- 
15
infected) eligible for screening, birth-cohort screen-
16
ing leads to 84,000 fewer cases of decompensated 
17
cirrhosis, 46,000 fewer cases of hepatocellular car-
18
cinoma, 10,000 fewer liver transplants, and 78,000 
19
fewer HCV-related deaths gained versus risk-based 
20
screening. 
21
(7) In 2013, the United States Preventive Serv-
22
ices Task Force (referred to in this section as the 
23
‘‘USPSTF’’) issued a Grade B rating for screening 
24
for HCV infection in persons at high risk for infec-
25
23:08 Jul 08, 2020
H6637
651 
•HR 6637 IH
tion and adults born between 1945 and 1965. In 
1
2014, the USPSTF issued a Grade B for screening 
2
for HBV in persons at high risk of hepatitis B infec-
3
tion. In 2009, the USPSTF issued a Grade A for 
4
screening pregnant women for HBV during their 
5
first prenatal visit, and in 2019, reaffirmed this 
6
grade. 
7
(8) There were 59 outbreaks (24 of HBV and 
8
36 of HCV, including one of both HBV and HCV) 
9
reported to CDC for investigation from 2008 
10
through 2016 related to health care-associated infec-
11
tion of HBV and HCV, 56 of which occurred in non- 
12
hospital settings. There were more than 115,983 pa-
13
tients potentially exposed to one of the viruses. 
14
(9) Chronic HBV and chronic HCV usually do 
15
not cause symptoms early in the course of the dis-
16
ease, but after many years of a clinically ‘‘silent’’ 
17
phase, CDC estimates show more than 33 percent of 
18
infected individuals will develop cirrhosis, end-stage 
19
liver disease, or liver cancer. Since most individuals 
20
with chronic HBV, HCV, or both are unaware of 
21
their infection, they do not know to take precautions 
22
to prevent the spread of their infection and can un-
23
knowingly exacerbate their own disease progression. 
24
23:08 Jul 08, 2020
H6637
652 
•HR 6637 IH
(10) HBV and HCV disproportionately affect 
1
certain populations in the United States. Although 
2
representing only about 6 percent of the population, 
3
Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders account for 
4
half of all chronic HBV cases in the United States. 
5
Baby Boomers (those born between 1945 and 1965) 
6
account for approximately 75 percent of domestic 
7
chronic HCV cases. In addition, African Americans, 
8
Latinos, and American Indian and Native Alaskans 
9
are among the groups which have disproportionately 
10
high rates of HBV or HCV infections in the United 
11
States. 
12
(11) For both chronic HBV and chronic HCV, 
13
behavioral changes and appropriate medical care can 
14
slow disease progression if diagnosis is made early. 
15
Early diagnosis, which is determined through simple 
16
blood tests, can reduce the risk of transmission and 
17
disease progression through education and vaccina-
18
tion of household members and other susceptible 
19
persons at risk. 
20
(12) Advancements have led to the development 
21
of improved diagnostic tests for viral hepatitis. 
22
These tests, including rapid, point-of-care testing 
23
and others in development, can facilitate testing, no-
24
tification of results and post-test counseling, and re-
25
23:08 Jul 08, 2020
H6637
653 
•HR 6637 IH
ferral to care at the time of the testing visit. In par-
1
ticular, these tests are also advantageous because 
2
they can be used simultaneously with HIV rapid 
3
testing for persons at risk for both HCV and HIV 
4
infections. 
5
(13) For those chronically infected with HBV 
6
or HCV, regular monitoring can lead to the early de-
7
tection of liver cancer at a stage where a cure is still 
8
possible. Liver cancer is the second deadliest cancer 
9
in the United States; however, liver cancer has re-
10
ceived little funding for research, prevention, or 
11
treatment. 
12
(14) Treatment for chronic HCV can eradicate 
13
the disease in approximately 90 percent of those cur-
14
rently treated. While there is no cure for chronic 
15
HBV, available treatments can effectively suppress 
16
viral replication in the overwhelming majority of 
17

20
(15) To combat the viral hepatitis epidemic in 
21
the United States, in February 2017, the Depart-
22
ment of Health and Human Services released its 
23
‘‘National Viral Hepatitis Action Plan 2017–2020’’ 
24
(referred to in this section as the ‘‘HHS Action 
25
23:08 Jul 08, 2020
H6637
654 
•HR 6637 IH
Plan’’). In March 2017, the National Academies of 
1
Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine released a re-
2
port entitled, ‘‘A National Strategy for the Elimi-
3
nation of Hepatitis B and C: Phase Two Report’’ 
4
(referred to in this section as the ‘‘NAS report’’), 
5
recommending specific actions to eliminate viral hep-
6
atitis as public health problems in the United States 
7
by 2030. 
8
(16) The annual health care costs attributable 
9
to HBV and HCV in the United States are signifi-
10
cant. For HBV, it is estimated to be approximately 
11
$2,500,000,000 ($2,000 per infected person). In 
12
2000, the lifetime cost of HBV—before the avail-
13
ability of most current therapies—was approximately 
14
$80,000 per chronically infected person, totaling 
15
more than $100,000,000,000. For HCV, medical 
16
costs for patients are expected to increase from 
17
$30,000,000,000 in 2009 to over $85,000,000,000 
18
in 2024. Avoiding these costs by screening and diag-
19
nosing individuals earlier—and connecting them to 
20
appropriate treatment and care, will save lives and 
21
critical health care dollars. Currently, without a 
22
comprehensive screening, testing, and diagnosis pro-
23
gram, most patients are diagnosed too late when 
24
they need a liver transplant costing at least 
25
23:08 Jul 08, 2020
H6637
655 
•HR 6637 IH
$314,000 for uncomplicated cases or when they have 
1
liver cancer or end-stage liver disease which costs 
2
$30,980 to $110,576 per hospital admission. As 
3
health care costs continue to grow, it is critical that 
4
the Federal Government invests in effective mecha-
5
nisms to avoid documented cost drivers. 
6
(17) According to the NAS report in 2010, 
7
chronic HBV and HCV infections cause substantial 
8
morbidity and mortality despite being preventable 
9
and treatable. Deficiencies in the implementation of 
10
established guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, 
11
and medical management of chronic HBV and HCV 
12
infections perpetuate personal and economic bur-
13
dens. Existing grants are not sufficient for the scale 
14
of the health burden presented by HBV and HCV. 
15
(18) Screening and testing for HBV and HCV 
16
is aligned with the goal of Healthy People 2020 to 
17
increase immunization rates and reduce preventable 
18
infectious diseases. Awareness of disease and access 
19
to prevention and treatment remain essential compo-
20
nents for reducing infectious disease transmission. 
21
(19) Federal support is necessary to increase 
22
knowledge and awareness of HBV and HCV and to 
23
assist State and local prevention and control efforts 
24

•HR 6637 IH
in reducing the morbidity and mortality of these 
1
epidemics. 
2
(20) The Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
3
vention reported a 233 percent increase in hepatitis 
4
C cases from 2010 to 2016, stemming from the 
5
opioid, heroin, and overdose epidemics affecting com-
6
munities nationwide. From 2014 to 2015, the num-
7
ber of reported cases of acute hepatitis B infection 
8
in the United States rose for the first time since 
9
2006, increasing by 20.7 percent, which is also 
10
largely attributable to the opioid epidemic. 
11
(21) The Secretary of Health and Human Serv-
12

13
cluding the amendments made by this subtitle) di-
14
rectly and through whichever of the agencies of the

(a) SHORT TITLE.—This subtitle may be cited as the 
17
‘‘Bone Marrow Failure Disease Research and Treatment 
18
Act of 2020’’. 
19
(b) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds the following: 
20
(1) Between 20,000 and 30,000 people in the 
21
United States are diagnosed each year with 
22
myelodysplastic syndromes, aplastic anemia, parox-
23
ysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, and other acquired 
24
bone marrow failure diseases.

(2) Acquired bone marrow failure diseases have 
1
a debilitating and often fatal impact on those diag-
2
nosed with these diseases. 
3
(3) While some treatments for acquired bone 
4
marrow failure diseases can prolong and improve the 
5
quality of patients’ lives, there is no single cure for 
6
these diseases. 
7
(4) The prevalence of acquired bone marrow 
8
failure diseases in the United States will continue to 
9
grow as the general public ages. 
10
(5) Evidence exists suggesting that acquired 
11
bone marrow failure diseases occur more often in 
12
minority populations, particularly in Asian-American 
13
and Latino or Hispanic populations. 
14
(6) The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Insti-
15
tute and the National Cancer Institute have con-
16
ducted important research into the causes of and 
17
treatments for acquired bone marrow failure dis-
18
eases. 
19
(7) The National Marrow Donor Program Reg-
20
istry has made significant contributions to the fight 
21
against bone marrow failure diseases by connecting 
22
millions of potential marrow donors with individuals 
23
and families suffering from these conditions.

(8) Despite these advances, a more comprehen-
1
sive Federal strategic effort among numerous Fed-
2
eral agencies is needed to discover a cure for ac-
3
quired bone marrow failure disorders. 
4
(9) Greater Federal surveillance of acquired 
5
bone marrow failure diseases is needed to gain a bet-
6
ter understanding of the causes of acquired bone 
7
marrow failure diseases. 
8
(10) The Federal Government should increase 
9
its research support for and engage with public and 
10
private organizations in developing a comprehensive 
11
approach to combat and cure acquired bone marrow 
12
failure diseases.

The Congress finds the following: 
17
(1) Over 1,100,000 people are estimated to be 
18
living with HIV in the United States according to 
19
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 14 
20
percent of whom are unaware they are living with

23
infections and 15,800 deaths in people with an HIV

diagnoses in 50 States and 6 dependent areas of the

United States. 
2
(3) The Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
3
vention estimates that, in 2017, there were approxi-
4
mately 38,700 people newly diagnosed with HIV. 
5
The estimated number of annual new HIV infections 
6
declined 9 percent from 2010 to 2016. However, the 
7
number of new infections is increasing among cer-
8
tain populations, such as Latino gay and bisexual 
9
men, where annual infections increase 21 percent. 
10
(4) HIV disproportionately affects certain popu-
11
lations in the United States. Though African Ameri-
12
cans represent approximately 12 percent of the pop-
13
ulation, African Americans account for almost half 
14
(42 percent) of all people living with HIV in the 
15
United States. African-American men who have sex 
16
with men account for 26 percent of all new HIV in-
17
fections and have remained stable from 2010 to 
18

(5) Disparities continue to exist among Latinos 
20
and Hispanics; in 2017, Latinos and Hispanics 
21
made up 18 percent of the United States population 
22
and 26 percent of new infections. 
23
(6) Though the rate of new infections among 
24

this section as ‘‘AI/AN’’) is proportional to their 
1
population size, from 2010 to 2016, the annual 
2
number of HIV diagnoses increased 46 percent 
3
among AI/AN overall and 81 percent among AI/AN 
4
gay and bisexual men. 
5
(7) Asian Americans account for about 2 per-
6
cent of new HIV infections, but in 2013, 22 percent 
7
were undiagnosed, the highest rate of undiagnosed 
8
HIV among any race or ethnicity. Between 2010 
9
and 2016, the number of Asians receiving an HIV 
10
diagnosis increased by 42 percent. 
11
(8) The latest data from the Centers for Dis-
12
ease Control and Prevention indicates that new in-
13
fections among women declined 21 percent between 
14
2010 and 2016. 
15
(9) The history of HIV shows that culturally 
16
relevant and gender-responsive supportive services, 
17
including psychosocial support, treatment literacy, 
18
case management, and transportation are necessary 
19
strategies to reach and engage women and girls in 
20
medical care. 
21
(10) Among the 3 million HIV testing events 
22
reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
23
vention in 2017, the percentage of transgender peo-
24
ple who received a new HIV diagnosis was 3 times

the national average. A 2019 systematic review and 
1
meta-analysis found that an estimated 14 percent of 
2
transgender women have HIV. By race/ethnicity, an 
3
estimated 44 percent of Black/African-American 
4
transgender women, 26 percent of Hispanic/Latina 
5
transgender women, and 7 percent of White 
6
transgender women have HIV. The limited data 
7
available on transgender individuals point to a dis-
8
proportionate burden of HIV infection. 
9
(11) Stigma and discrimination contribute to 
10
such disparities. 
11
(12) The Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
12
vention has determined that increasing the propor-
13
tion of people who know their HIV status is an es-
14
sential component of comprehensive HIV treatment 
15
and prevention efforts and that early diagnosis is 
16
critical in order for people with HIV to receive life- 
17
extending therapy. Additionally, the Centers for Dis-
18
ease Control and Prevention recommend routine 
19
HIV screening in health care settings for all patients 
20
aged 13 to 64, regardless of risk. 
21
(13) In 1998, Congress created the National 
22
Minority AIDS Initiative to provide technical assist-
23
ance, build capacity, and strengthen outreach efforts 
24
among local institutions and community-based orga-

nizations that serve racial and ethnic minorities liv-
1
ing with or vulnerable to HIV. 
2
(14) To combat the HIV epidemic in the United 
3
States, the National HIV/AIDS Strategy (referred 
4
to in this section as ‘‘NHAS’’) provides a framework 
5
of increasing access to care, reducing new infections, 
6
and eliminating HIV-related health disparities. The 
7
vision of NHAS is ‘‘The United States will become 
8
a place where new HIV infections are rare and when 
9
they do occur, every person, regardless of age, gen-
10
der, race/ethnicity, gender identity, or socioeconomic 
11
circumstance, will have unfettered access to high 
12
quality, life-extending care, free from stigma and 
13
discrimination.’’. 
14
(15) In January 2019, the Department of 
15
Health and Human Services began implementing the 
16
‘‘Ending the HIV Epidemic: A Plan for America’’. 
17
The initiative seeks to reduce the number of new 
18
HIV infections in the United States by 75 percent 
19
by 2025, and then by at least 90 percent by 2030, 
20
for an estimated 250,000 total HIV infection avert-
21
ed. 
22
(16) At present, many States and United 
23
States territories have criminal statutes based on 
24
‘‘exposure’’ to HIV. Most of these laws were adopted

before the availability of effective antiretroviral 
1
treatment for HIV/AIDS. 
2
(17) Research shows that stable housing leads 
3
to better health outcomes for those living with HIV. 
4
Inadequate or unstable housing is not only a barrier 
5
to effective treatment, but also increases the likeli-
6
hood of engaging in risky behaviors leading to HIV 
7
infection. Insecure housing puts people with HIV/ 
8
AIDS at risk of premature death from exposure to 
9
other diseases, poor nutrition, and lack of medical 
10
care. 
11
(18) Due to advances in treatment, many peo-
12
ple living with HIV today are living healthy lives and 
13
have the ability and desire to fully participate in all 
14
aspects of community life, including employment. 
15
Research associates being employed with tremendous 
16
economic, social, and health benefits for many people 
17
living with HIV. 
18
(19) The common benefits associated with em-
19
ployment include income, autonomy, productivity, 
20
and status within society, daily structure, making a 
21
contribution to one’s community, and increased skills 
22
and self-esteem. Research also indicates that many 
23
people with disabilities, including people living with 
24
HIV, report perceiving themselves as being less dis-

abled or not disabled at all, when working. Further-
1
more, some studies link working with better physical 
2
and mental health outcomes for people living with 
3
HIV when compared to those who are not working. 
4
Preliminary data also suggest that transitioning to 
5
employment is associated with reduced HIV-related 
6
health risk behavior for many people. 
7
(20) In July 2012, the Food and Drug Admin-
8
istration approved the first drug to be used as pre- 
9
exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). PrEP reduces the risk 
10
of HIV infection in HIV-negative individuals. Stud-
11
ies have shown that PrEP reduces HIV transmission 
12
from sex by about 99 percent when taken consist-
13
ently. Despite increases in PrEP uptake, PrEP use 
14
remains low among gay and bisexual men of color. 
15
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
16
found that uptake was lower among African-Amer-
17
ican (26 percent) and Latino (30 percent) men com-
18
pared with White men (42 percent). Similarly, PrEP 
19
awareness was lower among African-American (86 
20
percent) and Latino (87 percent) men compared 
21
with White men (95 percent). While clinical research 
22
on transgender populations and PrEP is currently 
23
limited, the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
24
tion recommends PrEP use in transgender popu-

lations. In September 2019, the Food and Drug Ad-
1
ministration approved the second drug to be used as 
2
PrEP. 
3
(21) Syringe service programs have been associ-
4
ated with lowered HIV infections, lower hepatitis C 
5
infections, and increased linkage to substance use 
6
treatment. 
7
(22) There is now conclusive scientific evidence 
8
that a person living with HIV who is on 
9
antiretroviral therapy and is durably virally sup-
10
pressed (defined as having a consistent viral load of 
11
less than <200 copies/ml) does not sexually trans-
12
mit HIV. The conclusive evidence about the highly 
13
effective preventative benefits of antiretroviral ther-
14
apy provides an unprecedented opportunity to im-
15
prove the lives of people living with HIV, improve 
16
treatment uptake and adherence, and advocate for 
17
expanded access to treatment and care.

(1) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (re-
11
ferred to in this subsection as ‘‘COPD’’) refers to 
12
chronic bronchitis and emphysema, incurable dis-
13
eases that make it difficult to exhale all the air from 
14
one’s lungs, and that can cause persistent coughing, 
15
shortness of breath, and sputum. 
16
(2) COPD exacerbations—episodes of acute dif-
17
ficulty breathing and moderate to severe fatigue— 
18
are dangerous, and their treatment often requires 
19
hospitalization. 
20
(3) While smoking is the primary risk factor for 
21
COPD, other risk factors include air pollution, occu-
22
pational exposures, heredity, a history of childhood 
23
respiratory infections, and socioeconomic status.

3
the United States, claiming over 134,000 lives in 
4
2010. 
5
(6) Since 2000, deaths for women with COPD 
6
have exceeded deaths in men. 
7
(7) Although African Americans have a lower 
8
prevalence of COPD in the United States, research-
9
ers have shown that African Americans may be

population-adjusted rate of TB among Hispanics

3
(6) TB is both preventable and curable, but the 
4
current rate of decline of TB in the United States 
5
remains too slow to achieve TB elimination in this 
6
century. 
7
(7) TB is transmitted through the air when a 
8
person who has TB disease in their lungs coughs or 
9
sneezes. People who are in close proximity to the 
10
person with TB can breathe in the TB bacteria, and 
11
the bacteria will initially settle in their lungs. With-
12
out proper and timely diagnosis and access to treat-
13
ment, the TB bacteria may grow and spread to 
14
other parts of their body. 
15
(8) As many as 13,000,000 people in the 
16
United States may have latent TB Infection (re-
17
ferred to in this section as ‘‘LTBI’’). People with 
18
LTBI have TB bacteria in their bodies, but their 
19
immune system is containing the bacteria, and they 
20
are not sick, nor do they have any current risk of 
21
spreading TB to others. LTBI can activate into in-
22
fectious, life-threatening TB if not treated. Modeling 
23
has shown that eliminating TB is not possible with-
24
out addressing LTBI.

(9) Comorbidities associated with TB include 
1
cancer, diabetes mellitus, and HIV. People with 
2
these medical conditions and compromised immune 
3
systems are more likely to develop active TB disease 
4
and to have worse outcomes from TB. 
5
(10) Forms of active TB that do not show drug 
6
resistance are classified as drug-susceptible TB (re-
7
ferred to in this section as ‘‘DS–TB’’). Drug-resist-
8
ant TB (referred to in this section as ‘‘DR–TB’’) is 
9
a rising threat to the public health of the United 
10
States. DR–TB that exhibits resistance to two or 
11
more first-line drugs is referred to as multi-drug re-
12
sistant TB (referred to in this section as ‘‘MDR– 
13
TB’’). MDR–TB that also is resistant to at least 
14
one injectable second-line medication and at least 
15
one fluoroquinolone is classified as extensively drug- 
16
resistant TB (referred to in this section as ‘‘XDR– 
17
TB’’). 
18
(11) Approximately 97 people in the United 
19
States were diagnosed with MDR–TB in 2018. One 
20
person was diagnosed with XDR–TB in the same 
21
year. 
22
(12) In the United States, $480 million was 
23
spent in 2018 to treat TB; direct treatment costs 
24
average $19,000 to treat a patient with DS–TB, 
25
23:08 Jul 08, 2020
H6637
819 
•HR 6637 IH
$175,000 to treat a patient with MDR–TB, and 
1
$544,000 to treat a patient with XDR–TB. When 
2
factoring in productivity losses during treatment, 
3
DS–TB averages $46,000, MDR–TB averages 
4
$294,000 and XDR–TB averages $694,000. Treat-
5
ment is often difficult, with daily complex multi-pill 
6
regimens and injections, with side-effects ranging 
7
from hearing and vision loss to mental health issues. 
8
(13) Recognizing the public health, economic 
9
and societal costs to the threat of MDR–TB, the 
10
National Action Plan to Combat MDR–TB was de-
11
veloped by the White House to provide the United 
12
States with a comprehensive three-pronged strategy 
13
to address MDR–TB by strengthening domestic ca-
14
pacity to combat MDR–TB; improve international 
15
capacity and cooperation to combat MDR–TB; accel-
16
erate basic and applied research and development 
17
for new therapies, diagnostics and prevention strate-
18
gies to combat MDR–TB. 
19
(14) Additional Federal support is necessary to 
20
expand TB control efforts in case finding and treat-
21
ment to address LTBI in a national prevention ini-
22
tiative. Key policy and research breakthroughs in-
23

tion’s ‘‘B’’ rating, screening for LTBI among high- 
1
risk adults as a covered service increases the likeli-
2
hood that impacted racial and ethnic minority 
3
groups can get tested for TB; a new, shorter course 
4
treatment regimen reduces the length of treatment 
5
for LTBI from every day for 6 to 9 months to one 
6
dose per week for 12 weeks, increasing likelihood of 
7
treatment completion; and the use of blood-based di-
8
agnostic tests, Interferon-gamma release assays or 
9
IGRAs, increases ability to detect LTBI among pa-
10
tients in affected communities. 
11
(15) The right to health, and the right to 
12
science as a necessary human right to help achieve 
13
the right to health, is enshrined in Articles 25 and 
14
27 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
15
These fundamental human rights cannot be achieved 
16
when anyone lacks access to TB prevention or treat-
17
ment, and when the benefits of scientific innovation 
18
are not extended to people with all forms of TB.

Congress finds as follows: 
4
(1) Eighty percent of African-American women 
5
and nearly 74 percent of Hispanic men are either 
6
overweight or obese, speeding the onset and progres-
7
sion of arthritis. 
8
(2) Arthritis affects 46,000,000 people in the 
9
United States, and that number will rise to 
10
67,000,000 by the year 2030. 
11
(3) Twenty-seven million people in the United 
12
States suffer from osteoarthritis, the most common 
13
form of arthritis, making it the leading cause of dis-
14
ability in the United States. Osteoarthritis is some-
15
times referred to as degenerative joint disease. 
16
(4) Obesity accelerates the onset of arthritis: 70 
17
percent of obese adults with mild osteoarthritis of 
18
the knee at age 60 will develop advanced end-stage 
19
disease by age 80. In contrast, just 43 percent of 
20
non-obese adults will have end-stage disease over the 
21
same time period. 
22
(5) Arthritis affects 1 in 5 people in the United 
23
States and is the single greatest cause of chronic 
24
pain and disability in the United States. 
25

•HR 6637 IH
(6) Women, African Americans, and Hispanics 
1
have more severe arthritis and functional limitations. 
2
These same individuals are more likely to be obese, 
3
diabetic, and have higher incidence of heart dis-
4
ease—medical conditions that can be improved with 
5
physical activity. Instead of moving, however, these 
6
groups have an inactivity rate of 40 to 50 percent, 
7
which continues to increase. 
8
(7) Arthritis costs $128,000,000,000 a year, in-
9
cluding $81,000,000,000 in direct costs (medical) 
10
and $47,000,000,000 in indirect costs (lost earn-
11
ings). Each year, $309,000,000,000 in direct and in-
12
direct costs is lost due to disparities in osteoarthritis 
13
and musculoskeletal diseases. 
14
(8) Obesity and other chronic health conditions 
15
exacerbate the debilitating impact of arthritis, lead-
16
ing to inactivity, loss of independence, and a per-
17
petual cycle of comorbid chronic conditions.

20
mated 43,000,000 annual visits to physicians’ offices

and outpatient clinics where arthritis was the pri-
22
mary diagnosis. Women also represented 60 percent

diagnosis. 
2
(10) Women ages 65 and older have up to 21⁄2 
3
times more disabilities than men of the same age. 
4
Higher rates of obesity and arthritis among this 
5
group explained up to 48 percent of the gender gap 
6
in disability, above all other common chronic health 
7
conditions. 
8
(11) The primary indication for total knee 
9
arthroplasty (referred to in this section as ‘‘TKA’’), 
10
also known as knee replacement, is relief of signifi-
11
cant, disabling pain caused by severe arthritis. 
12
(12) Knee replacement is surgery for people 
13
with severe knee damage. Knee replacement can re-
14
lieve pain and allow you to be more active. When 
15
you have a total knee replacement, the surgeon re-
16
moves damaged cartilage and bone from the surface 
17
of your knee joint and replaces them with a man- 
18
made surface of metal and plastic. In a partial knee 
19
replacement, the surgeon only replaces one part of 
20
your knee joint. 
21
(13) Total hip replacement, also called total hip 
22
arthroplasty (referred to in this section as ‘‘THA’’), 
23
is used if your hip pain interferes with daily activi-

helped. Arthritis damage is the most common reason 
1
to need hip replacement. 
2
(14) The odds of a family practice physician 
3
recommending TKA to a male patient with moderate 
4
arthritis are twice that of a female patient, while the 
5
odds of an orthopaedic surgeon recommending TKA 
6
to a male patient with moderate arthritis are 22 
7
times that of a female patient. 
8
(15) African Americans with doctor-diagnosed 
9
arthritis have a higher prevalence of severe pain at-
10
tributable to arthritis, compared with Whites (34.0 
11
percent versus 22.6 percent). African Americans, 
12
compared to Whites, report a higher proportion of 
13
work limitations (39.5 percent versus 28.0 percent) 
14
and a higher prevalence of arthritis-attributable 
15
work limitation (6.6 percent versus 4.6 percent). 
16
(16) Hispanics are 50 percent more likely than 
17
non-Hispanic Whites to report needing assistance 
18
with at least one instrumental activity of daily living 
19
and to have difficulty walking. 
20
(17) African Americans and Hispanics were 1.3 
21
times more likely to have activity limitation, 1.6 
22
times more likely to have work limitations, and 1.9 
23
times more likely to have severe joint pain than

significantly lower than for Whites—even for those 
4
with equitable health care coverage such as through

8
Medicare enrollees were 37 percent less likely than

‘‘Sleep and Circadian Rhythm Disorders Health Dispari-
10
ties Act’’. 
11
(b) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
12
(1) Decrements in sleep health such as sleep 
13
apnea, insufficient sleep time, and insomnia, affect 
14
50,000,000 to 70,000,000 adults in the United 
15
States. Twelve to eighteen million United States 
16
adults have sleep apnea, a chronic disorder charac-
17
terized by one or more pauses in breathing which 
18
can last from a few seconds to minutes. They may 
19
occur 30 times or more an hour, disrupting sleep 
20
and resulting in excessive daytime sleepiness and 
21
loss in productivity. 
22
(2) Seventy percent of high school students are 
23
not getting enough sleep on school nights, while 33 
24
percent of people in the United States get fewer

than 7 hours of sleep per night, and roughly 6,000 
1
fatal motor vehicle crashes are caused by drowsy 
2
drivers. 
3
(3) Insufficient sleep and insomnia are more 
4
prevalent in women. Women who are pregnant and 
5
have sleep apnea are at an increased risk of cardio-
6
vascular complications during pregnancy. The im-
7
pact of disparities in sleep health is associated with 
8
a growing number of health problems, including the 
9
following: 
10
(A) Hypertension. 
11
(B) Cancer. 
12
(C) Stroke. 
13
(D) Cardiac arrhythmia. 
14
(E) Chronic heart failure and heart dis-
15
ease. 
16
(F) Diabetes. 
17
(G) Cognitive functioning and behavior. 
18
(H) Depression and bipolar disorder. 
19
(I) Substance abuse. 
20
(4) A sleep disparity exists in that poor sleep 
21
quality is strongly associated with poverty and race. 
22
Factors such as employment, education, and health 
23
status, amongst others, significantly mediated this 
24
effect only in poor subjects, suggesting a differential 
25

•HR 6637 IH
vulnerability to these factors in poor relative to 
1
nonpoor individuals in the context of sleep quality. 
2
(5) African Americans sleep worse than Cauca-
3
sian Americans. African Americans take longer to 
4
fall asleep, report poorer sleep quality, have more 
5
light and less deep sleep, and nap more often and 
6
longer. 
7
(6) African Americans and individuals in lower 
8
socioeconomic status groups may be at an increased 
9
risk for sleep disturbances and associated health 
10
consequences. 
11
(7) Among young African Americans, the likeli-
12
hood of having sleep disordered breathing and exhib-
13
iting risk factors for poor sleep is twice that in 
14
young Caucasians. Frequent snoring is more com-
15
mon among African-American and Hispanic women 
16
and Hispanic men compared to non-Hispanic Cauca-
17
sians, independent of other factors including obesity. 
18
(8) African Americans with sleep-disordered 
19
breathing develop symptoms at a younger age than 
20
Caucasians but appear less likely to be diagnosed 
21
and treated in a timely manner. This delay may at 
22
least in part be due to reduced access to care. 
23
(9) Sleep loss contributes to increased risk for 
24
chronic conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and hy-

pertension, all of which have increased prevalence in 
1
underserved, underrepresented minorities. Racial 
2
and ethnic disparities related to obesity may also 
3
contribute to disparities in health outcomes related 
4
to sleep-disordered breathing. 
5
(10) Non-Caucasian adults report an insomnia 
6
rate of 12.9 percent compared to only 6.6 percent 
7
for Caucasians. 
8
(11) African-American women have a higher in-
9
cidence of insomnia than African-American men, 
10
perhaps related in part to higher risk for chronic 
11
persisting symptoms.

(1) DETERMINANTS
OF
HEALTH.—The term 
8
‘‘determinants of health’’— 
9
(A) means the range of personal, social, 
10
economic, and environmental factors that influ-
11
ence health status; and

22
made and natural environments), psychological, so-
23
cial, spiritual, cultural and aesthetic environment.

(3) BUILT
ENVIRONMENT.—The term ‘‘built

2
ment, and the location of these components in a geo-
3
graphically defined space, that are created or modi-
4
fied by individuals to form the physical and social 
5
characteristics of a community or enhance quality of 
6
human life, including— 
7
(A) homes, schools, and places of work and

11
(C) transportation systems; 
12
(D) business, industry, and agriculture; 
13
and 
14
(E) land-use plans, projects, and policies 
15
that impact the physical or social characteris-
16
tics of a community, including access to services 
17
and amenities. 
18
(4) PERSONAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH.— 
19
The term ‘‘personal determinants of health’’ means 
20
an individual’s behavior, biology, and genetics. 
21
(5) SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH.—The 
22
term ‘‘social determinants of health’’ means a subset 
23
of determinants of the health of individuals and en-
24
vironments (such as communities, neighborhoods, 
25
23:08 Jul 08, 2020

and societies) that describe an individual’s or group 
1
of people’s social identity, describe the social and 
2
economic resources to which such individual or 
3
group has access, and describe the conditions in 
4
which an individual or group of people works, lives, 
5
and plays. 
6
(6) ECONOMIC DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH.— 
7
The term ‘‘economic determinants of health’’ refers 
8
to income and social status. Higher income and so-
9
cioeconomic status (SES) are linked to decreased 
10
rates of morbidity and mortality. The higher your 
11
SES, the healthier you are the longer you’ll live. 
12
Low SES leads to an increased risk of illness and 
13
death. 
14
SEC. 1002. FINDINGS. 
15
Congress finds as follows: 
16
(1) Social determinants of health are the larg-
17
est predictors of health outcomes. 
18
(2) Social determinants of health, including 
19
health-related behaviors, social and economic factors, 
20
and physical environment factors account for 80 per-
21
cent of health outcomes, whereas clinical care ac-
22
counts for 20 percent of improved health outcomes. 
23
Yet, in 2017, public health spending only rep-
24

•HR 6637 IH
resented 2.5 percent of all health spending in the 
1
United States. 
2
(3) There are more opportunities to improve 
3
health for everyone when we understand that health 
4
starts, first, not in a medical setting, but in our 
5
families, in our schools and workplaces, in our 
6
neighborhoods, in the air we breathe, and in the 
7
water we drink. 
8
(4)(A) Healthy People 2020 identifies health 
9
and health care quality as a function of not only ac-
10
cess to health care, but also the social determinants 
11
of health, categorized into the following: neighbor-
12
hoods and the built environment; social and commu-
13
nity context; education; and economic stability. 
14
(B) The following examples illustrate the nexus 
15
between the unequal distribution of the social deter-
16
minants of health and health disparities: 
17
(i) The built environment influences resi-
18
dents’ level of physical activity. Neighborhoods 
19
with high levels of poverty are significantly less 
20
likely to have places where children can be 
21
physically active, such as parks, green spaces, 
22
and bike paths and lanes. Neighborhoods and 
23
communities can provide opportunities for phys-
24
ical activity and support active lifestyles

through accessible and safe parks and open 
1
spaces and through land use policy, zoning, and 
2
healthy community design. 
3
(ii) Emotional and physical health and 
4
well-being are directly impacted by perceived 
5
levels of safety, such as unlit streets at night. 
6
Community members have expressed that safety 
7
is not only a barrier to accessing programs and 
8
services that increase quality of life but they 
9
are also not able to access physical activity in 
10
their community through the built environment. 
11
(iii) In many workplace environments. 
12
(iv) Historical and institutional racism in 
13
the United States has shaped the way in which 
14
social and economic resources and exposure to 
15
health promoting environments are distributed. 
16
Income, education, occupation, neighborhood 
17
conditions, schools, workplaces, the use of 
18
health and social services, and experiences with 
19
the criminal justice system are all highly pat-
20
terned by race, with people of color experiencing 
21
more that is health harming. Finding ways to 
22
uncouple the link between race and access to re-
23
sources and healthy environments is a principal 
24
means of reducing health disparities. Addition-
25

•HR 6637 IH
ally, the anticipation of racism itself causes 
1
higher psychological and cardiovascular stress 
2
levels that are linked to poor health outcomes. 
3
Remedying discriminatory practices at the indi-
4
vidual and systemic levels will likely reduce 
5
health disparities caused by this unequal dis-
6
tribution of stress. 
7
(v) Poor health among Native Americans 
8
has largely been driven by post-colonial oppres-
9
sion and historical trauma. The expropriation of 
10
native lands and territories to the American 
11
state had severe consequences on Native Amer-
12
ican health. This resulted in the deprivation of 
13
traditional food sources—and nutrients—for 
14
Native Americans and also the destruction of 
15
traditional economies and community organiza-
16
tion. Today, Native Americans have twice the 
17
rate of diabetes of non-Hispanic Whites. Rec-
18
ognition of the origins of the diabetes as having 
19
a social and community context, rather than 
20
just individual responsibility and genetic pre-
21
disposition, will shape better policy to provide 
22
food security. 
23
(vi) In the context of prisons, overcrowding 
24
has led to the deterioration of the physical and 
25
23:08 Jul 08, 2020
H6637
903 
•HR 6637 IH
mental health of individuals after they leave 
1
prison. In particular, the mass incarceration of 
2
African-American males as a result of unequal 
3
contact with and treatment in the criminal jus-
4
tice system has contributed to an overburdening 
5
of certain infectious diseases within the African- 
6
American community. As a social institution, 
7
incarceration amplifies existing adverse health 
8
conditions by concentrating diseases and harm-
9
ful health behaviors such as tobacco use, drug 
10
use, and violence. 
11
(vii) Educational attainment is the strong-
12
est predictor of adult mortality. It is a basic 
13
component of socioeconomic status that shapes 
14
earning potential to access resources that pro-
15
mote health. People with more education are 
16
less likely to report that they are in poor health, 
17
and are also less likely to have diabetes and 
18
other chronic diseases. 
19
(viii) Individuals with lower levels of edu-
20
cational attainment are much more likely to re-
21
port to be current smokers. In 2017, smoking 
22
prevalence was 36.8 percent among adults with 
23
a GED diploma, 23.1 percent with less than a 
24
high school diploma, and 18.7 percent with a

high school diploma, while dropping signifi-
1
cantly to 7.1 percent among adults with an un-
2
dergraduate college degree and 4.1 percent with 
3
a postgraduate college degree. 
4
(ix) Income inequality differences account 
5
for a large part of health disparities. For exam-
6
ple, children living in poverty experience poorer

housing conditions, increased exposure to in-
8
door allergens and toxins (such as pesticides, 
9
lead, mercury, radon, air pollution, and carcino-
10
gens), increased food insecurity, and more psy-
11
chological stress. These experiences culminate 
12
in worse adult health as compared with children 
13
with higher socioeconomic status. Specifically, 
14
children living in lower socioeconomic neighbor-
15
hoods have higher rates of asthma due to high-
16
er rates of psychological stress resulting from 
17
higher rates of violence. Food insecurity is asso-

(xi) Individuals in older and cheaper hous-
10
ing are at higher risks to be exposed to lead, 
11
particularly in housing built prior to 1960. The 
12
threat of lead poisoning disproportionally af-
13
fects vulnerable populations, with children living 
14
in poverty (5.6 percent) and Black children 
15
(5.6) experiencing the highest rates. According 
16
to the Department of Housing and Urban De-
17
velopment, about 3,600,000 homes nationwide 
18
that house young children have lead hazards 
19
such as contaminated drinking water, peeling

REGULA-
3
TIONS.— 
4
(I) On February 12, 2003, the 
5
Environmental 
Protection

WATERS
OF
THE
UNITED 
5
STATES.— 
6
(I) On December 2, 2008, the 
7
Environmental Protection Agency and 
8
the Corps of Engineers jointly issued 
9
a guidance document, entitled ‘‘Clean 
10
Water Act Jurisdiction Following the 
11
U.S. Supreme Court’s Decision in 
12
Rapanos v. United States & Carabell 
13
v. United States’’. 
14
(II) The guidance described in 
15
subclause (I) dictates enforcement ac-
16
tions under the Federal Water Pollu-
17
tion Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et 
18
seq.) and calls for a complicated 
19
‘‘case-by-case’’ analysis to determine 
20
jurisdiction for waterways that do not 
21
flow all year. 
22
(III) Enforcement actions de-
23
scribed in subclause (II) endanger 
24
small streams and wetlands that serve

which play a fundamental role in safe-

4
fects of floods and droughts. 
5
(IV) The definition provided in 
6
the guidance described in subclause 
7
(I) for ‘‘waters of the United States’’ 
8
is applicable to the Federal Water 
9
Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 
10
1251 et seq.) as a whole, potentially 
11
affecting programs that control indus-
12
trial pollution and sewage levels, pre-
13
vent oil spills, and set water quality

(i) HEALTHY FORESTS RESTORATION 
18
ACT OF 2003.— 
19
(I) On December 3, 2003, the 
20
President signed into law the Healthy 
21
Forests Restoration Act of 2003 (16 
22
U.S.C. 6501 et seq.) (referred to in

964 
•HR 6637 IH
(II) Although the law attempts to 
1
reduce the risk of catastrophic forest 
2
fires, the law provides a boon to tim-
3
ber companies by accelerating the ag-
4
gressive thinning of backcountry for-
5
ests that are located far from at-risk 
6
communities. 
7
(III) The law allows for increased 
8
logging of large, fire-resistant trees 
9
that are not in close proximity to 
10
homes and communities. 
11
(IV) The law undermines critical 
12
protections for endangered species by 
13
exempting Federal land management 
14
agencies from consulting with the 
15
United States Fish and Wildlife Serv-
16
ice before approving any action that 
17
could harm endangered plants or wild-
18

(V) The law limits public partici-

10
(I) On September 20, 2006, the

10
(II) Despite the enjoinment of 
11
the 2005 rule and the subsequent res-
12
toration of the 2001 rule, the Forest 
13
Service has continued to allow States 
14
to petition for a special rule under the

regulations governing interagency coopera-
7
tion under section 7 of the Endangered 
8
Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1536). 
9
(ii) The rule described in clause (i) 
10
undermines the intention of the Endan-
11
gered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) 
12
to protect species and the ecosystems on 
13
which those species depend by allowing

15
fund an action without proper environ-
16
mental review and expert third-party con-
17
sultation from Federal wildlife experts.

(iii) Under the rule described in 
19
clause (i), Federal agencies can unilaterally 
20
circumvent the formal review process,
