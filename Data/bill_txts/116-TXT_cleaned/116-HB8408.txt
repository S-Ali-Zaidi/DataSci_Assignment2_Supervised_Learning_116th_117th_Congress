section (a), the Administrator shall— 
3
(1) require an applicant for an amended type 
4
certificate for a transport airplane to— 
5
(A) perform a system safety assessment 
6
with respect to each proposed design change 
7
that the Administrator determines is signifi-
8
cant, with such assessment considering the air-
9
plane-level effects of individual errors, malfunc-
10
tions, or failures and realistic pilot response 
11
times to such errors, malfunctions, or failures 
12
related to such change;

(B) update such assessment to account for 
14
each subsequent proposed design change that 
15
the Administrator determines is significant; and 
16
(C) provide appropriate employees of the

Administration with the data and assumptions 
18
underlying each assessment and amended as-
19
sessment; and
