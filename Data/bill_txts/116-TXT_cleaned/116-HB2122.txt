SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Protect Our Workers 
2
Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
The Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) The Davis-Bacon Act of 1931 (40 U.S.C. 
6
3141 et seq.) requires that contractors and sub-
7
contractors on certain government projects pay con-
8
struction workers locally prevailing wages as deter-
9
mined by the Department of Labor. 
10
(2) Locally prevailing wages vary by job classi-
11
fication and consist of a basic hourly rate of pay and 
12
benefits. 
13
(3) Generally, the Davis-Bacon Act applies to 
14
projects that meet three criteria— 
15
(A) there is a contract for construction in 
16
excess of $2,000; 
17
(B) the United States or the District of 
18
Columbia is a party to the contract; and 
19
(C) the contract is for construction, alter-
20
ation, or repair. 
21
(4) Under the Davis-Bacon Act, the Govern-
22
ment may terminate a contract if locally prevailing 
23
wages have not been paid to employees working on 
24
the project.

(5) For close to 90 years, this law has helped 
1
ensure quality craftsmanship on Federal projects, 
2
protected the standard of living of skilled and 
3
trained blue-collar construction workers, improved 
4
workplace safety by discouraging low-road contrac-
5
tors from bidding, and stimulated the economy. 
6
(6) The Wage and Hour Division of the De-
7
partment of Labor administers the Davis-Bacon Act 
8
by, among other things, determining prevailing wage 
9
rates and prescribing regulations and standards to 
10
be observed by contracting agencies. 
11
(7) Contracting agencies, such as the Corps of 
12
Engineers, however, have the primary day-to-day re-
13
sponsibility for enforcement of the Davis-Bacon Act 
14
and its labor standards requirements. See, e.g., sub-
15
parts 22.406 and 22.407 of the Federal Acquisition 
16
Regulation. 
17
(8) Some irresponsible contractors and sub-
18
contractors often avoid their prevailing wage obliga-
19
tions by, among other things, engaging in craft and 
20
independent contractor misclassification. 
21
(9) Craft misclassification refers to the practice 
22
in which contractors misclassify high-skilled workers 
23
as general laborers or other classifications in order 
24

•HR 2122 IH
to avoid paying the higher prevailing wage rate ap-
1
plicable to the high-skilled work actually performed. 
2
(10) Independent contractor misclassification 
3
refers 
to 
the 
practice 
in 
which 
contractors 
4
misclassify employees as independent contractors to 
5
avoid paying prevailing wages, reduce labor costs, 
6
and avoid State and Federal taxes. 
7
(11) This practice denies workers access to fed-
8
erally prescribed prevailing wages for the work done 
9
and related benefits. Communities also suffer be-
10
cause misclassification results in lower tax revenues 
11
for Federal, State, and local governments. 
12
(12) In 2000, the Department of Labor com-
13
missioned a study to determine the extent of 
14
misclassification, and found that up to 30 percent of 
15
audited firms had employees misclassified as inde-
16
pendent contractors. 
17
(13) In light of the intended Federal invest-
18
ment for military construction projects for fiscal 
19
year 2020, it is appropriate to investigate the com-
20
pliance of the Corps of Engineers with the require-
21
ments of the Davis-Bacon Act.

11
(2) Any programs or protocols the Corps of En-
12
gineers has in place for the purpose of identifying 
13
and 
addressing 
independent 
contractor 
14
misclassification on projects subject to the Davis- 
15
Bacon Act. 
16
(3) The frequency with which the Corps of En-
17
gineers conducts site visits on each covered project 
18
to monitor Davis-Bacon Act compliance. 
19
(4) The frequency with which the Corps of En-
20
gineers monitors certified payroll reports submitted 
21
by contractors and subcontractors on each covered 
22
project. 
23
(5) Whether the Corps of Engineers accepts 
24
and investigates complaints of Davis-Bacon Act vio-

lations submitted by third parties, such as contrac-
1
tors and workers’ rights organizations. 
2
(6) Whether the Corps of Engineers maintains 
3
a database listing all contractors and subcontractors 
4
who have, in one way or another, violated the Davis- 
5
Bacon Act and whether the Corps consults this 
6
database as part of its contract award process. 
7
(7) The frequency, over the last five years, with 
8
which the Corps of Engineers penalized, disqualified, 
9
terminated, or moved for debarment of a contractor 
10
for Davis-Bacon violations. 
11
(8) How the Corps of Engineers verifies that 
12
the contractors it hires for its projects are properly 
13
licensed.

(b) REPORT TO CONGRESS.—Not later than 1 year 
15
