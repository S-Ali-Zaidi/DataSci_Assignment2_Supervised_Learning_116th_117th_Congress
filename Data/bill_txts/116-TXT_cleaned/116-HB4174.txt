To assist States in improving guardianship oversight and 
data collection. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Guardianship Account-
4
ability Act of 2019’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSES. 
6
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) An estimated 1,300,000 adults and approxi-
8
mately $50,000,000,000 in assets are under the care 
9
of guardians in the United States.

(2) Most guardians are selfless, dedicated indi-
1
viduals who play an important role in safeguarding 
2
individuals in need of support. However, unscrupu-
3
lous guardians acting with little oversight have used 
4
guardianship proceedings to obtain control of indi-
5
viduals in need of support. 
6
(3) Once a guardianship is imposed, there are 
7
often few safeguards in place to protect against indi-
8
viduals who choose to abuse the system and few 
9
States are able to report accurate or detailed guard-
10
ianship data. 
11
(4) A full guardianship order may remove more 
12
rights than necessary and may not be the best 
13
means of providing support and protection to an in-
14
dividual. If individuals subject to guardianship re-
15
gain capacity, all or some rights should be quickly 
16
and efficiently restored. 
17
(5) States should encourage courts to use alter-
18
natives to guardianship through State statutes, in-
19
cluding the adoption of the Uniform Guardianship, 
20
Conservatorship, and Other Protective Arrange-
21
ments Act, to ensure better protections and control 
22
for individuals being considered for guardianship 
23
and those pursuing a restoration of their rights.

(6) A national resource center on guardianship 
1
is needed to collect and publish information for the 
2
benefit of courts, policy makers, individuals subject 
3
to guardianship, guardians, community organiza-
4
tions, and other stakeholders. 
5
(b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this Act are to help 
6
States improve guardianship oversight and data collection 
7
by— 
8
(1) designating a National Online Resource 
9
Center on Guardianship; 
10
(2) authorize grants for the purpose of devel-
11
oping State Guardianship Databases; and 
12
(3) establishing procedures for sharing back-
13
ground check information related to appointed 
14
guardians with other jurisdictions.
