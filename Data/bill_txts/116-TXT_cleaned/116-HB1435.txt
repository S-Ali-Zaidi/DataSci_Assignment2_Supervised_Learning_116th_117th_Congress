A BILL 
To direct the Secretary of the Interior to take actions sup-
porting non-Federal investments in water infrastructure 
improvements in the Sacramento Valley, and for other 
purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Sites Reservoir Project

Congress finds the following:

•HR 1435 IH
(1) According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, the 
1
State of California experienced one of the longest, 
2
driest periods on record from late December 2011 
3
until April 2017, with a statewide emergency dec-
4
laration in effect from mid-January 2014 until early 
5
April 2017. In water year 2017, the State of Cali-
6
fornia experienced one of the wettest years on 
7
record. New surface water storage infrastructure 
8
with the capacity to store water in wet years for use 
9
in dry periods is urgently needed. 
10
(2) The Sites Project (sometimes referred to as 
11
‘‘North-of-Delta Offstream Storage’’) has been iden-
12
tified by the State of California and the Federal 
13
Government as an important component to inte-
14
grated water management in the Sacramento Valley 
15
that would advance the co-equal objectives of im-
16
proving water management and restoring ecological 
17
health for beneficial uses of the Sacramento-San 
18
Joaquin Delta and the Sacramento River watershed. 
19
Further, the Sites Reservoir was found in the 2000 
20
CALFED Record of Decision to be the preferred lo-
21
cation to provide North-of-Delta Offstream Storage 
22
and subsequent studies have shown the Sites Res-
23
ervoir to be technically and economically feasible. 
24

•HR 1435 IH
(3) Among other things, the Sites Project 
1
would— 
2
(A) increase surface water storage to en-
3
hance water management flexibility in the Sac-
4
ramento Valley; 
5
(B) improve operation of the State’s water 
6
system to provide improvements in ecosystem 
7
and water quality conditions in the Bay-Delta 
8
while providing a more reliable water supply for 
9
the State of California; 
10
(C) improve conditions for fish, waterfowl, 
11
and wildlife in the Sacramento Valley, including 
12
anadromous fish in the Sacramento River; 
13
(D) provide local flood control benefits; 
14
(E) 
integrate 
with 
renewable 
energy 
15
sources consistent with applicable Federal and 
16
State of California goals; 
17
(F) create both construction and long-term 
18
jobs to improve the local and regional econo-
19
mies in the Sacramento Valley; 
20
(G) provide additional recreational bene-
21
fits; and 
22
(H) reduce local flooding. 
23
(4) The Sites Project has been shown to provide 
24
approximately 
500,000 
acre-feet 
of 
additional 
25

annualized yield that, when integrated into the oper-
1
ations of the State and Federal reservoirs upstream 
2
of the Bay-Delta, can improve the system-wide oper-
3
ational efficiency for both water supply reliability 
4
and the environment. 
5
(5) Healthy wetlands and wildlife refuges are of 
6
vital importance to wildlife in California and require 
7
a reliable supply of water. Additional surface water 
8
storage can help meet water supply goals under the 
9
Central Valley Project Improvement Act (title 
10
XXXIV of Public Law 102–575). 
11
(6) It is in the interests of the United States 
12
for the Federal Government to work with the Sites 
13
Project Authority, which has been established under 
14
the laws of the State of California as an independent 
15
joint exercise of powers authority to, among other 
16
things, study, promote, develop, design, finance, ac-
17
quire, construct, manage, and operate Sites Res-
18
ervoir and related facilities to advance the Sites 
19
Project in the most expeditious and cost-effective 
20
manner possible. 
21
(7) On July 24, 2018, the California Water 
22
Commission voted to award $816,000,000 to the 
23
Sites Project under Proposition 1 (Water Quality, 
24
Supply, and Infrastructure Improvement Act of

2014), showing a strong commitment from the State 
1
of California to advance the project.

(8) As of the date of the introduction of this 
3
Act, the Sites Project Authority had the following 
4
public agencies serving on its 11-member governing 
5
board: Colusa County Water District, Glenn-Colusa 
6
Irrigation District, Placer County Water District/

City of Roseville, Reclamation District 108, Sac-
8
ramento County Water Agency/City of Sacramento,

the Tehama-Colusa Canal Authority, Westside

12
Sacramento Valley and agencies from the Bay Area,

San Joaquin Valley, and southern California are ac-
14
tively participating to advance the Sites Project.
