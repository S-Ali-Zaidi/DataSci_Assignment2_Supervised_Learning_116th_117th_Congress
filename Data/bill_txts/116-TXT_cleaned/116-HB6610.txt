Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Director of Pandemic 
4
and Biodefense Preparedness and Response Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
6
(a) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) The United States could have, and should 
8
have, been significantly more prepared to combat the 
9
COVID–19 pandemic. 
10
(2) Examples of this are numerous but include 
11
the loss of stockpiled ventilators to breakage because 
12
the Federal Government let maintenance contracts 
13
lapse in 2018, the reuse of personal protective equip-
14
ment that is only sanitary for single-patient use due 
15
to shortages, and the scarcity of available testing 
16
compared to other nations. 
17
(3) The loss of life and harm to the national 
18
economy is already staggering yet its extent will not 
19
be known for some time. 
20
(4) As in previous pandemics and other major 
21
health crises, confusion during the COVID–19 pan-
22
demic about which agency was in charge of what 
23
and who would coordinate the response of multiple 
24
23:45 Jun 25, 2020
H6610
3 
HR 6610 IH1S 
agencies lead to calls for a ‘‘czar’’ to be named, as 
1
well as a task force to be created. 
2
(5) The Federal Government currently supports 
3
pandemic and biodefense preparedness and response 
4
in several ways through a myriad of agencies, each 
5
responsible for disparate programs and responsibil-
6
ities related to pandemics, biological attacks, and 
7
other major health crises. 
8
(6) Following the attack on our homeland on 
9
September 11, 2001, the Director of National Intel-
10
ligence position was created to ensure the coopera-
11
tion of several agencies in the Intelligence Commu-
12
nity through one Cabinet-level official coordinating 
13
between and among multiple Federal agencies 
14
charged with breaking down silos while keeping the 
15
Nation safe. 
16
(7) Preparing the United States for and re-
17
sponding to a future pandemic, biological attack, or 
18
other major health crisis should be a top priority 
19
across agencies of the Federal Government, yet the 
20
COVID–19 pandemic exposed the need for greater 
21
cohesion and speed in both preparedness and re-
22
sponse. 
23
(8) Various Federal agencies report on rec-
24
ommendations for preparation and response to 
25
23:45 Jun 25, 2020
H6610
4 
HR 6610 IH1S 
pandemics, biological attacks, and other major 
1
health crises, but no one Federal official can produce 
2
and speak with authority on a national pandemic 
3
and biodefense preparedness and response strategy 
4
or execute such a strategy. 
5
(9) A key element for success during response 
6
activities will be ‘‘staying ahead of the emergency’’— 
7
in other words, being more proactive than reactive. 
8
This will require elements including— 
9
(A) timely, accurate assessments of newly 
10
emerged risks and vulnerabilities; 
11
(B) a streamlined, unified effort to lead all 
12
Federal Government efforts, coordinate State 
13
and local government activities, and provide 
14
clear guidance to assets in the private sector; 
15
(C) a coordinated national communications 
16
program to inform, educate, and gain the trust 
17
and support of the American public; and 
18
(D) a national leader with the authority, 
19
responsibility, and accountability to ensure the 
20
most effective coordination of Federal agencies 
21
and best use of national assets. 
22
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
23
gress that the creation of the Cabinet-level position of the 
24
Director of Pandemic and Biodefense Preparedness and

Response and a well-designed National Pandemic and Bio-

2
efit the United States in several important ways, including 
3
by ending silos between and among various Federal agen-
4
cies charged with parts of pandemic and biodefense pre-
5
paredness and response, including the Federal Emergency 
6
Management Agency, the Centers for Disease Control and
