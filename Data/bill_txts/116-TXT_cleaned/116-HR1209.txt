RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for Supreme Court decisions affirming 
the constitutionally protected right of same-sex couples 
to marry. 
Whereas, on June 26, 2013, the Supreme Court held in 
Windsor v. United States that the so-called Defense of 
Marriage Act unconstitutionally deprived same-sex cou-
ples of the liberty protected by the Fifth Amendment; 
Whereas pursuant to the Windsor ruling, same-sex couples 
cannot be deprived of Federal benefits and protections 
provided by the Government to married couples in a wide 
array of areas; 
Whereas Supreme Court Justice Ginsburg recognized that 
Federal marital benefits affect every area of life, and that 
denying them to married same-sex couples created, in ef-
fect, a ‘‘sort of skim milk marriage’’; 
Whereas married same-sex couples have accessed and relied 
upon these equal benefits, including some funded gen-
erally by all program participants, such as Social Secu-
rity survivor benefits, and many that can provide an es-
sential economic lifeline, such as retirement benefits and 
veteran and military benefits, as well as inheritance bene-
fits and other Federal tax benefits; 
Whereas, on June 26, 2015, the Supreme Court held in 
Obergefell v. Hodges that States may not deprive same- 
sex couples of the constitutionally protected freedom to 
marry; 
Whereas the Supreme Court confirmed in Obergefell v. 
Hodges that ‘‘the Constitution promises liberty to all

within its reach, a liberty that allows persons, within a 
lawful realm, to define and express their identity’’; 
Whereas, on June 27, 2017, the Supreme Court confirmed in 
Pavan v. Smith that it is unconstitutional to deny same- 
sex couples the benefits and responsibilities of marriage 
that are provided to different-sex couples; 
Whereas the Census Bureau has estimated there are approxi-
mately 543,000 same-sex married-couple households in 
the United States and almost 500,000 households with 
same-sex unmarried partners living together; 
Whereas there are an estimated 114,000 same-sex couples 
raising children in the United States; 
Whereas same-sex couples are seven times more likely than 
different-sex couples to be raising an adopted or foster 
child; 
Whereas same-sex couples may not be deprived of the right 
to marry and the protections and responsibilities of mar-
riages in 29 other countries; 
Whereas the European Court of Justice requires that all Eu-
ropean Union countries recognize same-sex couples’ mar-
riages for immigration purposes; 
Whereas, on October 5, 2020, Supreme Court Justice Thom-
as issued a Statement, with which Justice Alito joined, 
concerning the Court’s denial of a petition for a writ of 
certiorari in Kim Davis v. David Ermold; 
Whereas the Statement improperly invites legal challenges to 
the Supreme Court’s important Obergefell precedent by 
announcing the Justices are seeking to grant review of a 
case that ‘‘cleanly’’ challenges that precedent in order to 
address what they characterize as a ‘‘problem that only 
it can fix’’;

•HRES 1209 IH 
Whereas the Statement incorrectly asserts the Obergefell v. 
Hodges decision brands religious adherents as ‘‘bigots’’; 
Whereas the Statement wrongfully frames marriage equality 
for same-sex couples and religious liberty interests as 
mutually exclusive; 
Whereas marriage equality for same-sex couples does not im-
pinge upon the rights of clergy or religious institutions by 
forcing them to solemnize the marriages of same-sex cou-
ples, just as they are free not to solemnize the marriages 
of couples of different faith traditions; 
Whereas although the rulings in Windsor v. United States, 
Obergefell v. Hodges, and Pavan v. Smith are Supreme 
Court precedents preventing the Federal and all State 
governments 
from 
marriage-related 
discrimination 
against same-sex couples, Federal legislation is needed to 
prevent discrimination against same-sex couples and 
LGBTQ individuals in the private sector; 
Whereas, on May 17, 2019, the House of Representatives 
passed the Equality Act in a bipartisan vote; and 
Whereas, on May 20, 2019, the Senate received the Equality 
Act for consideration and has not acted on the bill: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) strongly opposes Justice Thomas and Jus-
2
tice Alito’s Statement in Davis v. Ermold; 
3
(2) acknowledges that same-sex couples have re-
