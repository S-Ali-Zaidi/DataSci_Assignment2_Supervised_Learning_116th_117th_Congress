SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist and 
8
Washington Post columnist, was killed and dis-

membered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Tur-
1
key on October 2, 2018, by agents with close ties to 
2
the Government of Saudi Arabia. 
3
(2) Khashoggi was a longtime resident of the 
4
United States, living in Virginia under an ‘‘O’’ visa 
5
and was in the process of applying for a permanent 
6
residency. Two of his four children are United 
7
States citizens. 
8
(3) For many years, Khashoggi wrote on Saudi 
9
political and cultural issues and after criticisms of 
10
Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, Khashoggi 
11
chose to reside in the United States due to his grow-
12
ing fear of arrest in Saudi Arabia. From a self-im-
13
posed exile, he wrote monthly columns in the Wash-
14
ington Post, including columns that criticized var-
15
ious Saudi policies. 
16
(4) On October 2, 2018, Khashoggi visited the 
17
Saudi consulate in Istanbul with his fiance´e to con-
18
duct routine consular matters. She waited for him 
19
for over ten hours outside the consulate, but he 
20
never re-emerged. The Turkish authorities subse-
21
quently reported that Khashoggi was murdered in-
22
side the Saudi consulate. 
23
(5) For over two weeks following the murder, 
24
Saudi Arabia denied any knowledge of Khashoggi’s 
25

•HR 4507 IH
whereabouts and claimed the allegations were 
1
‘‘false’’ and ‘‘baseless’’. However, on October 20, 
2
2018, state television in Saudi Arabia reported that 
3
the journalist was murdered in a ‘‘rogue operation’’ 
4
under the orders of intelligence officers. 
5
(6) Though Saudi Arabia has detained 21 peo-
6
ple, dismissed two senior officials, and charged elev-
7
en people for Khashoggi’s murder, the Government 
8
of Saudi Arabia has denied that Saudi leadership or-
9
dered the killing and has refused to extradite any 
10
suspects to Turkey. 
11
(7) To date the United States Government has 
12
taken no actions to force an independent, inter-
13
national investigation of the killing of Jamal 
14
Khashoggi nor shown any willingness to hold ac-
15
countable the highest levels of Saudi leadership.
