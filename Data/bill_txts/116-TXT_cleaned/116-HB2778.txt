•HR 2778 IH
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Healthy Maternity and 
4
Obstetric Medicine Act’’ or the ‘‘Healthy MOM Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. 
6
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Pregnancy is a significant life event for mil-
8
lions of women in the United States each year. 
9
(2) For more than 30 years, our Nation, 
10
through the Medicaid program, has recognized that 
11
pregnant women need immediate access to afford-
12
able care, and has allowed women who meet income- 
13
eligibility requirements to enroll in Medicaid cov-
14
erage when they become pregnant. 
15
(3) Congress recognized the central importance 
16
of maternity coverage by classifying maternity and 
17
newborn care as one of the ten essential health bene-
18
fits that must now be covered on most individual 
19
and small group health insurance plans under sec-
20
tion 1302(b)(1) of the Patient Protection and Af-
21
fordable Care Act (42 U.S.C. 18022(b)(1)). 
22
(4) Congress has also recognized the significant 
23
challenge of maternal mortality and the need to 
24
eliminate disparities in maternal health outcomes for 
25
00:34 May 30, 2019
H2778

•HR 2778 IH
pregnancy-related and pregnancy-associated deaths, 
1
and to improve health outcomes for both mothers 
2
and babies through passage of the Preventing Ma-
3
ternal Deaths Act of 2018 (Public Law 115–344). 
4
(5) Access to comprehensive maternity coverage 
5
allows women to access important pregnancy-related 
6
care, which is demonstrated to improve health out-
7
comes for women and newborns and reduce financial 
8
costs for both consumers and insurers. 
9
(6) Uninsured women, women with grand-
10
fathered and transitional health plans, self-funded 
11
student health plans, and catastrophic and high-de-
12
ductible health plans may lack access to comprehen-
13
sive and affordable maternity coverage. 
14
(7) Employer health plans that exclude depend-
15
ent daughters from maternity coverage leave young 
16
women without coverage for their pregnancy, even 
17
though Federal law has long held that treating preg-
18
nancy differently than other conditions is sex-based 
19
discrimination. 
20
(8) A special enrollment period is especially im-
21
portant for young adults, who are at high risk for 
22
unintended pregnancies, yet young adults are fre-
23
quently enrolled in catastrophic coverage, which 
24
00:34 May 30, 2019
H2778

•HR 2778 IH
often has fewer benefits, more restrictions, and high-
1
er deductibles. 
2
(9) This coverage would be an equalizer for 
3
communities of color. The maternal mortality rate 
4
varies drastically by race and ethnicity, and where a 
5
woman lives. The rising maternal mortality rate in 
6
the United States is driven predominantly by the 
7
disproportionately high African-American maternal 
8
mortality rate, which is four times more than the 
9
rate for White women. 
10
(10) According to the Centers for Disease Con-
11
trol and Prevention, about 700 women die each year 
12
in the United States from pregnancy-related com-
13
plications. Black and American Indian/Alaska Native 
14
women are about three times more likely to die from 
15
a pregnancy-related cause than White women. 
16
(11) Data demonstrates that 3 in 5 pregnancy 
17
related deaths could be prevented. Improving access 
18
to care is one way to help prevent deaths, regardless 
19
of race or ethnicity. 
20
(12) Timely maternity care improves the health 
21
of pregnant women, as well as birth outcomes and 
22
the health of babies throughout their lifetimes. Preg-
23
nancy-related maternal mortality is three to four 
24
times higher among women who receive no maternity 
25
00:34 May 30, 2019
H2778

•HR 2778 IH
care compared to women who do. Regular maternity 
1
care can detect or mitigate serious pregnancy-related 
2
health complications, including preeclampsia, pla-
3
cental abruption, complications from diabetes, com-
4
plications from heart disease, and Graves’ disease, 
5
all of which can result in morbidity or mortality for 
6
the mother or newborn. 
7
(13) The Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
8
vention reports that more than half of all maternal 
9
deaths occur at delivery or in the first postpartum 
10
year, whereas just more than one-third of preg-
11
nancy-related or pregnancy-associated deaths occur 
12
while a person is still pregnant. Yet, for women eligi-
13
ble for the Medicaid program on the basis of preg-
14
nancy, such Medicaid coverage lapses at the end of 
15
the month on which the 60th postpartum day lands. 
16
(14) Timely maternity care and adequate 
17
postpartum care can reduce short- and long-term 
18
health care costs. If a woman does not have access 
19
to affordable maternity care during her pregnancy, 
20
and she or her newborn experiences pregnancy com-
21
plications that result in health problems after birth, 
22
their insurer may end up paying much higher costs 
23
than if the insurer had covered the woman’s mater-
24
nity care during her pregnancy. Intensive maternity 
25
00:34 May 30, 2019
H2778
6 
•HR 2778 IH
care can reduce hospital and neonatal intensive care 
1
unit admissions among infants, resulting in cost sav-
2
ings of $1,768 to $5,560 per birth. For women with 
3
high-risk pregnancies, intensive maternity care saves 
4
$1.37 for every $1 invested in maternity care. 
5
(b) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act is to protect 
6
the health of women and newborns by ensuring that all 
7
women eligible for coverage through the Exchanges estab-
8
lished under title I of the Patient Protection and Afford-
9
able Care Act (Public Law 111–148) and women eligible 
10
for other individual or group health plan coverage can ac-
11
cess affordable health coverage during their pregnancy.
