Whereas sexual violence and gender-based violence are tools

Whereas survivors of sexual violence face a significant num-
ber of health problems, including chronic conditions, sui-
cide, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder; 
Whereas discrimination on the basis of sex includes discrimi-
nation on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, 
sex stereotypes, pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, 
childbirth, and related medical conditions; 
Whereas the 2015 United States Transgender Survey found 
that— 
(1) 47 percent of transgender people have been sexu-
ally assaulted; and

Native Americans, 59 percent of multiracial people, 58

stalking by an intimate partner, compared to 35 percent 
of heterosexual women; and 
(2) 40 percent of gay men and 37 percent of bisex-
ual men have experienced sexual violence other than rape, 
compared to 21 percent of heterosexual men; 
Whereas the National Women’s Law Center 2017 Let Her

Whereas, according to a research report by the National In-
stitute of Justice, 56.1 percent of American Indian and 
Alaska Native women have experienced sexual violence; 
Whereas sexual violence also affects adolescent girls and, ac-
cording to the National Women’s Law Center 2017 Let 
Her Learn Survey, 1 in 5 girls aged 14 to 18 has been 
kissed or touched without consent, including 24 percent 
of Latina girls, 23 percent of Native American girls, and 
22 percent of Black girls; 
Whereas studies show that sexual violence and gender-based 
violence are underreported crimes, indicating that the 
rates of sexual violence and gender-based violence may be 
even higher than these estimates; 
Whereas too many survivors from communities that face sys-
temic barriers are ignored, blamed, and cast aside when 
seeking support after experiencing a form of sexual vio-
lence or gender-based violence; 
Whereas communities that have been disproportionately 
harmed by the criminal justice system, including Black 
women and girls, may be less likely to report sexual vio-
lence when that violence occurs; 
Whereas incarcerated women report extensive histories of 
emotional, physical, and sexual abuse; 
Whereas, according to the Department of Justice, ‘‘allega-
tions of sexual misconduct were made in all but one State

lence; 
Whereas communities of color are overrepresented in jails 
and prisons in the United States and disproportionately 
impacted by violence, including sexual violence, in the 
criminal justice system; 
Whereas youth of color, youth with disabilities, and youth 
who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or 
gender non-conforming are overrepresented in the child 
welfare system; 
Whereas lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender youth are 
overrepresented in the youth homeless population, mak-
ing them particularly at risk for sexual violence; 
Whereas the Center for American Progress reports that 22 
percent of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender youth 
have been sexually assaulted or raped, which is more 
than 3 times the rate of sexual assault and rape among 
other homeless youth; 
Whereas, according to the GLSEN 2016 report entitled 
‘‘From Teasing to Torment: School Climate Revisited’’— 
(1) 
59.6 
percent 
of 
lesbian, 
gay, 
bisexual, 
transgender, and queer (referred to in this preamble as 
‘‘LGBTQ’’) secondary students have been sexually har-
assed at school, and LGBTQ students are more likely to 
experience sexual harassment than non-LGBTQ students; 
and 
(2) students with nontraditional gender expression 
are more likely to experience sexual harassment than stu-
dents with traditional gender expression;

sault, harassment, and affirmative consent; 
Whereas less than 40 percent of all high schools and only 14 
percent of middle schools in the United States teach all 
of the topics identified by the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention as important sexual health education top-
ics; 
Whereas, according to the National Center for Victims of 
Crime, a child who is the victim of prolonged sexual 
abuse usually develops low self-esteem, a feeling of worth-
lessness, and an abnormal or distorted view of sex; 
Whereas, according to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National 
Network, there is an increased likelihood that an indi-
vidual will suffer from suicidal or depressive thoughts 
after experiencing sexual violence; 
Whereas, at a time of prioritized mass detention and deporta-
tion and the rescinding of the Deferred Action for Child-
hood Arrivals Program, it is less safe for immigrants to 
report sexual violence; 
Whereas immigrant children are separated from their families 
and thousands of those children report sexual abuse in 
Government-funded detention camps; 
Whereas a history of systemic inequality and discrimination 
as well as incomplete solutions has resulted in a lack of 
resources to meet the needs of diverse survivor popu-
lations; 
Whereas, according to the National Alliance to End Sexual 
Violence— 
(1) there is a lack of resources for sexual violence 
and gender-based violence prevention for youth;

(2) many rape crisis centers have waiting lists for 
prevention programs; and 
(3) more investment is needed in the Rape Preven-

Whereas a 2016 National Consensus Statement of Anti-Sex-
ual Assault and Domestic Violence Organizations in Sup-
port of Full and Equal Access for the Transgender Com-
munity, signed by over 300 local, State, and national or-
ganizations, stated: ‘‘As organizations that care about re-
ducing assault and violence, we favor laws and policies 
that protect transgender people from discrimination, in-
cluding in accessing facilities that match the gender they 
live every day.’’; 
Whereas sexual violence and gender-based violence will only 
end if— 
(1) the experiences and needs of immigrant sur-
vivors, survivors who are incarcerated, American Indian 
or Alaska Native survivors, survivors of child sexual 
abuse, queer and intersex survivors, and survivors with 
disabilities are respected and supported; and 
(2) those survivors are provided culturally and lin-
guistically appropriate and relevant services and accom-
modations; 
Whereas current support systems mandated by Federal law 
for survivors of sexual violence are neither comprehensive 
nor fully representative of the vast and pervasive ele-
ments within rape culture; and 
Whereas Congress is working to confront pervasive sexual vi-
olence in the workplace, in schools, and in every area of 
life: Now, therefore, be it
