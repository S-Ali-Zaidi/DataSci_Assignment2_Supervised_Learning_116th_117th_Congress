It is the sense of Congress that— 
6
(1) with respect to the alliance between the

8
(A) ‘‘we go together’’ or ‘‘katchi kapshida’’

sacrifice of the United States and the Republic 
1
of Korea during the Korean War, reinforced by 
2
our shared values and reaffirmed each time the 
3
Republic of Korea has stood alongside the 
4
United States in the four major wars the 
5
United States has fought outside Korea since 
6
1945; 
7
(B) a transactional view of the alliance be-
8
tween the United States and the Republic of 
9
Korea is contrary to the spirit of ‘‘we go to-
10
gether’’; 
11
(C) 70 years since the start of the Korean 
12
War, as the People’s Republic of China esca-
13
lates its aggressive behavior in maritime and air 
14
domains and the Democratic People’s Republic 
15
of Korea continues to enhance and test weapons 
16
that threaten regional peace and security, a new 
17
strategic environment in the Indo-Pacific region 
18
has reinforced the importance of the alliance 
19
between the United States and the Republic of 
20
Korea; 
21
(D) the 2018 National Defense Strategy 
22
states that ‘‘the willingness of rivals to abandon 
23
aggression will depend on their perception of

tions and public statements that undermine the 
2
United States relationship with the Republic of 
3
Korea harm United States national security 
4
and exacerbate risks to members of the Armed 
5
Forces and United States allies and partners; 
6
and 
7
(E) United States alliances and troop de-
8
ployments should be based on shared principles 
9
and goals, not on the profit motive; and 
10
(2) with respect to nationals of the Republic of 
11
Korea who are employees of United States Forces 
12
Korea— 
13
(A) the United States Government should 
14
endeavor to avoid actions that negatively affect 
15
the welfare or well-being of such individuals; 
16
(B) as stated by the Commander of United 
17
States Forces Korea on March 31, 2020, the 
18
partial furlough of such individuals was ‘‘heart-
19
breaking’’ and ‘‘in no way a reflection of their 
20
performance, dedication, or conduct’’; and 
21
(C) the United States Government should 
22
work with the Government of the Republic of 
23
Korea to ensure that such individuals do not
