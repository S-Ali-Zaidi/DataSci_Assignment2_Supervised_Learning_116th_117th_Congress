SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
7
(a) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds the following: 
8
(1) The Coronavirus 2019 (COVID–19) pan-
9
demic and the resulting recession have led to more 
10
than 4.8 million cases and at least 157,000 deaths 
11
in the United States as of August 6, 2020; a 7.6 
12
percent increase in the unemployment rate from 
13
February to June, or approximately 12 million more 
14
persons who have lost their job; and an estimated 36 
15
percent of renters and 4.1 million homeowners who 
16
are struggling to pay their rent and mortgages. 
17
(2) According to the Centers for Disease Con-
18
trol, ‘‘long-standing systemic health and social in-
19
equities have put some members of racial and ethnic 
20
02:11 Sep 04, 2020

•HR 7993 IH
minority groups at increased risk of getting COVID– 
1
19 or experiencing severe illness’’. 
2
(3) Minority-owned businesses are also facing 
3
more difficult economic circumstances than others as 
4
a result of the COVID–19 pandemic. In April 2020, 
5
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported 
6
that minority- and women-owned businesses were 
7
not only more likely to show signs of limited finan-
8
cial health, but also twice as likely to be classified 
9
as ‘‘at risk’’ or ‘‘distressed’’ than their non-minority 
10
counterparts. 
11
(4) During the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID–19) 
12
pandemic, community development financial institu-
13
tions (CDFIs) and minority depository institutions 
14
(MDIs) have delivered needed capital and relief to 
15
underserved communities, many of which have borne 
16
a disproportionate impact of the COVID–19 pan-
17
demic. Through July 31, 2020, CDFIs and MDIs 
18
have provided more than $16.2 billion in Paycheck 
19
Protection Program (PPP) loans to small businesses 
20
with a smaller median loan size of about $75,000 
21
compared to the overall program median loan size of 
22
$103,000. 
23
(5) In addition to establishing relief funds and 
24
services for local businesses and individuals experi-
25

•HR 7993 IH
encing loss of income, CDFIs and MDIs have pro-
1
vided mortgage forbearances, loan deferments, and 
2
modifications to help address the needs of their bor-
3
rowers. CDFIs and MDIs are reaching underserved 
4
communities and minority-owned businesses at a 
5
critical time. 
6
(6) The Community Development Financial In-
7
stitutions Fund (CDFI Fund) is an agency of the 
8
U.S. Department of the Treasury and was estab-
9
lished by the Riegle Community Development and 
10
Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994. The mission 
11
of the CDFI Fund is ‘‘to expand economic oppor-
12
tunity for underserved people and communities by 
13
supporting the growth and capacity of a national 
14
network of community development lenders, inves-
15
tors, and financial service providers’’. As of July 13, 
16
2020, there were 1,129 certified CDFIs in all 50 
17
States, District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto 
18
Rico. 
19
(7) Following the 2008 financial crisis and the 
20
disproportionate impact the Great Recession had on 
21
minority communities, the number of MDI banks fell 
22
more than 30 percent over the following decade, to 
23
143 as of the first quarter of 2020. Meanwhile, MDI 
24
credit unions have seen similar declines, with more 
25

•HR 7993 IH
than one-third of such institutions disappearing 
1
since 2013. 
2
(8) The Committee on Financial Services of the 
3
House of Representatives has examined the impor-
4
tance of CDFIs and MDIs through three hearings 
5
held during the 116th Congress. At these hearings, 
6
the Committee received testimony from 13 witnesses, 
7
most of whom were representatives of CDFIs or 
8
MDIs, and four of whom were Federal regulators. 
9
These hearings include: 
10
(A) October 22, 2019, ‘‘An Examination of 
11
the Decline of Minority Depository Institutions 
12
and the Impact on Underserved Communities’’. 
13
(B) November 20, 2019, ‘‘An Examination 
14
of Regulators’ Efforts to Preserve and Promote 
15
Minority Depository Institutions’’. 
16
(C) June 3, 2020, Virtual Hearing—‘‘Pro-
17
moting Inclusive Lending During the Pandemic: 
18
Community Development Financial Institutions 
19
and Minority Depository Institutions’’. 
20
At these hearings, the Committee discussed the op-
21
portunities and challenges facing CDFIs and MDIs. 
22
The Committee discussed 9 different pieces of legis-
23
lation to address some of these challenges and fully 
24
support the work of MDIs and CDFIs.

(1) The Community Development Financial In-

15
the Department of the Treasury, and was estab-
16
lished by the Riegle Community Development and

18
of the CDFI Fund is ‘‘to expand economic oppor-

(a ‘‘CDE’’) is a domestic corporation or partnership 
2
that is an intermediary vehicle for the provision of 
3

4

Fund programs as follows:

(A) The Bank Enterprise Award Program,

which provides FDIC-insured depository institu-
10
tions awards for a demonstrated increase in 
11
lending and investments in distressed commu-
12

(B) The CDFI Program, which provides 
14
Financial and Technical Assistance awards to 
15
CDFIs to reinvest in the CDFI, and to build 
16
the capacity of the CDFI, including financing 
17
product development and loan loss reserves.

number of CDFIs owned by Native Americans

(F) The Bond Guarantee Program, a 
10
source of long-term, patient capital for CDFIs 
11
to expand lending and investment capacity for 
12
community and economic development purposes. 
13
(2) The Department of the Treasury is author-
14
ized to create multi-year grant programs designed to 
15
encourage low-to-moderate income individuals to es-
16
tablish accounts at federally insured banks, and to 
17
improve low-to-moderate income individuals’ access 
18
to such accounts on reasonable terms. 
19
(3) Under this authority, grants to participants 
20
in CDFI Fund programs may be used for loan-loss 
21
reserves and to establish small-dollar loan programs 
22
by subsidizing related losses. These grants also allow 
23

1
vide low-cost alternatives to payday loans and other 
2
nontraditional forms of financing that often impose 
3
excessive interest rates and fees on borrowers, and 
4
lead millions of Americans to fall into debt traps. 
5
Small-dollar loans can only be made pursuant to 
6
terms, conditions, and practices that are reasonable 
7
for the individual consumer obtaining the loan. 
8
(4) Program participation is restricted to eligi-
9
ble institutions, which are limited to organizations 
10
listed in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue 
11
Code and exempt from tax under 501(a) of such 
12
Code, federally insured depository institutions, com-
13
munity development financial institutions and State, 
14
local, or Tribal government entities. 
15
(5) Since its founding, the CDFI Fund has 
16
awarded over $3,300,000,000 to CDFIs and CDEs, 
17
allocated $54,000,000,000 in tax credits, and 
18
$1,510,000,000 in bond guarantees. According to 
19
the CDFI Fund, some programs attract as much as 
20
$10 in private capital for every $1 invested by the 
21
CDFI Fund. The Administration and the Congress 
22
