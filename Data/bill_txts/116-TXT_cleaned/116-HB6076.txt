Congress finds the following:

•HR 6076 IH
(1) According to the Office of the Taxpayer Ad-
1
vocate, the difference between tax liabilities owed to 
2
the Internal Revenue Service and those liabilities ac-
3
tually collected by the IRS, known as the ‘‘tax gap’’, 
4
averaged roughly $381,000,000,000 annually in un-
5
paid taxes from 2011 to 2013. 
6
(2) Recent studies project that the tax gap will 
7
be a cumulative $7,500,000,000,000 between 2020 
8
and 2029. 
9
(3) Individual income taxes are the largest 
10
group of uncollected taxes before audits, represent-
11
ing about $314,000,000,000. 
12
(4) Estimates suggest that at least 70 percent 
13
of the tax gap comes from underpayment by the top 
14
1 percent. 
15
(5) In 2011, more than 12 percent of individ-
16
uals making $1,000,000 or more annually were au-
17
dited. In 2018, only 3.2 percent of such individuals 
18
were audited. 
19
(6) For the eighth year in a row, IRS tax en-
20
forcement declined. The IRS audited 0.45 percent of 
21
personal income-tax returns, the lowest level in at 
22
least four decades. 
23
(7) Individuals are about half as likely to be au-
24
dited now compared to 2010.

(8) Audit rates for those making $10,000,000 
1
or more have fallen from more than 14 percent in 
2
2017 to roughly 6.5 percent in 2018. 
3
(9) Over the course of the past decade, the 
4
number of income tax returns has increased by 
5
roughly nine percent. 
6
(10) Businesses are being audited at a rate of 
7
1.6 percent, a near record low. The IRS had set a 
8
target of 2.2 percent. 
9
(11) Audit rates for the largest corporations in 
10
2011 were more than 90 percent. Now, they are 
11
closer to 50 percent. 
12
(12) Business taxes in 2019 are on track to be 
13
the lowest portion of Federal revenue on record, ac-
14
counting for 3.5 percent of all Federal tax revenue 
15
through the third quarter of 2019. 
16
(13) In 2010, corporate taxes accounted for 9 
17
percent of Federal revenue. 
18
(14) The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has pushed 
19
business taxes to record lows, and, according to the 
20
Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, 91 of 
21
the Fortune 500 companies paid $0 in income tax 
22
in 2018 despite turning a profit. 
23
(15) According to a new report from the Office 
24
of the Taxpayer Advocate, the average United States 
25
23:43 Mar 06, 2020

•HR 6076 IH
household is paying an annual surtax of more than 
1
$3,000 to subsidize taxpayers who aren’t paying all 
2
that they owe. 
3
(16) According to the Congressional Budget Of-
4
fice, the IRS’s budget is roughly 20 percent below 
5
its peak 2010 inflation-adjusted budget. 
6
(17) According to the IRS, the agency has lost 
7
nearly 30,000 full-time positions since 2010. 
8
(18) According to the IRS, 31 percent of its 
9
workers will retire within the next five years. 
10
(19) Despite this, the agency has also seen in-
11
creased workload due to the implementation of the 
12
Affordable Care Act and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 
13
(20) Studies have shown that investing in en-
14
forcement and tightening rules could generate more 
15
than $1,000,000,000,000 over a decade. 
16
(21) The Federal Government estimates that 
17
each additional dollar spent on tax enforcement 
18
could yield more than $4 in revenue. 
19
(22) IRS data demonstrates that an extra audi-
20
tor-hour spent auditing returns for those earning 
21
$5,000,000 or more raises nearly $5,000. 
22
(23) In fiscal year 2018, the IRS collected 
23
nearly $3,500,000,000,000 on a budget of about 
24
$11,430,000,000.

(24) According to a 2018 study by the Congres-
1
sional Budget Offce, increasing IRS funding by a 
2
total of $20,000,000,000 over 10 years could in-
3
crease revenue by a total of $55,000,000,000.
