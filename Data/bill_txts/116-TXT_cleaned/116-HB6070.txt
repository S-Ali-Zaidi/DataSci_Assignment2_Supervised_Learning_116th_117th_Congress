A BILL 
To establish grant programs to improve the health of border 
area residents and for all hazards preparedness in the 
border area including bioterrorism, infectious disease, 
and noncommunicable emerging threats, and for other 
purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Border Health Secu-
2
rity Act of 2020’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress makes the following findings: 
5
(1) The United States-Mexico border is an 
6
interdependent and dynamic region of approximately 
7
15,000,000 residents and millions of border cross-
8
ings each year, with significant and unique public 
9
health challenges. 
10
(2) These challenges include low rates of health 
11
insurance coverage, poor access to health care serv-
12
ices, lack of education or access to information, pov-
13
erty, and high rates of dangerous diseases, such as 
14
tuberculosis and West Nile virus, as well as other 
15
noncommunicable diseases such as cardiovascular 
16
disease, asthma, diabetes, and obesity. 
17
(3) As the 2020 dengue outbreak in Mexico and 
18
many parts of Latin America illustrates, diseases do 
19
not respect international boundaries, and a strong 
20
public health effort at and along the borders is cru-
21
cial to not only protect and improve the health of 
22
Americans but also to help secure the country 
23
against threats to biosecurity and other emerging 
24
threats.

•HR 6070 IH
(4) For 20 years, the United States-Mexico 
1
Border Health Commission has served as a crucial 
2
binational institution to address these unique and 
3
truly cross-border health issues. 
4
(5) In 2016, 66 percent of Canadians lived 
5
within 100 miles of the United States border. The 
6
2003 epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome 
7
caused more than 250 illnesses in the Greater To-
8
ronto Area, just 80 miles from New York. 
9
(6) The recent coronavirus outbreak has high-
10
lighted the need for continued coordination of re-
11
sources, effective communication, and information 
12
sharing between countries to address emerging pub-
13
lic health crises.
