•HR 4270 IH
(1) During the 2019 anti-extradition bill and 
1
pro-democracy protests, the Hong Kong Police 
2
Force used non-lethal crowd control articles such as 
3
water cannon trucks, tear gas, rubber bullets, 
4
sponge grenades, beanbag rounds, batons, pepper 
5
spray, pepper balls, and projectile launchers. 
6
(2) The United Nations High Commissioner for 
7
Human Rights, along with human rights organiza-
8
tions, have called for an investigation of the use of 
9
crowd control tactics used in Hong Kong which fall 
10
short of international standards, including the 
11
United Nations Code of Conduct for Law Enforce-
12
ment Officials and the Basic Principles on the Use 
13
of Force and Firearms for Law Enforcement Offi-
14
cials. 
15
(3) United States companies received export li-
16
censes to sell the Hong Kong Police Force munitions 
17
and non-lethal crowd control defense articles and 
18
services and at least some of those articles were used 
19
by the police unnecessarily and disproportionately 
20
during largely peaceful demonstrations. 
21
(4) The Government of the United Kingdom 
22
suspended export licenses for the sale of tear gas 
23
and other non-lethal crowd control equipment to 
24
Hong Kong until concerns about human rights

abuses are addressed by the Hong Kong Special Ad-
1
ministrative Region government. 
2
(5) The European Parliament adopted a resolu-
3
tion calling on European governments and the inter-
4
national community to impose export-control mecha-
5
nisms to deny the Hong Kong and Chinese govern-
6
ments access to technologies used to violate basic 
7
rights. 
8
(6) Hong Kong citizens and the international 
9
community have called for changes to the Hong 
10
Kong Police’s crowd control tactics and these re-
11
quests have gone unheeded by the Hong Kong Spe-
12
cial Administrative Region government.

(b) STATEMENT OF POLICY.—It is the policy of the 
14
United States— 
15
(1) to restrict the export of security assistance

internationally recognized human rights as required 
20
by section 502B(a) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 
21
1961 (22 U.S.C. 2304(a)); and 
22
