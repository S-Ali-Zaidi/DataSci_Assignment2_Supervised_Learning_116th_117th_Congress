RESOLUTION 
Reaffirming support for the Good Friday Agreement and 
other agreements to ensure a lasting peace in Northern 
Ireland. 
Whereas, on April 10, 1998, the Government of Ireland and 
the Government of the United Kingdom signed the Good 
Friday Agreement; 
Whereas the main goal of the Good Friday Agreement was 
to bring an end to the violence on the island of Ireland 
and to ensure self-determination, peace, and reconcili-
ation for the people of the island of Ireland; 
Whereas the successful negotiation of the Good Friday Agree-
ment stands as a historic and groundbreaking success

that has proven critical to the decades of relative peace 
that have followed; 
Whereas an exit from the European Union by the United 
Kingdom that does not appropriately protect the Good 
Friday Agreement threatens to undermine progress that 
has been made in moving beyond the legacy of the past 
in Northern Ireland; 
Whereas the power-sharing agreement negotiated between the 
Government of Ireland, the Government of the United 
Kingdom, and parties in Northern Ireland in 1998 was 
a critical step toward negotiating lasting solutions to the 
issues described in the Good Friday Agreement and in 
other agreements that followed; 
Whereas the collapse of the power-sharing institutions in 
2017 has created additional difficulties and is serving as 
a roadblock to continued progress; 
Whereas despite the historic progress of the Good Friday 
Agreement and subsequent agreements, important issues 
remain unresolved in Northern Ireland, including secur-
ing justice for victims of state-sponsored violence and 
other violence and providing for the rights of all sections 
of the community; 
Whereas the reintroduction of barriers, checkpoints, or per-
sonnel, also known as a ‘‘hard border’’, between the Re-
public of Ireland and Northern Ireland would further 
threaten economic cooperation between the Republic of 
Ireland and the United Kingdom as well as the successes 
of the Good Friday Agreement; 
Whereas the United States Congress served a prominent as-
sisting role in the negotiation of Good Friday Agreement

and has taken a leading role in striving for peace on the 
island of Ireland more broadly; and 
Whereas Congress greatly values the close relationships the 
United States shares with both the United Kingdom and 
the Republic of Ireland and stands steadfastly committed 
to supporting the peaceful resolution of any and all polit-
ical challenges in Northern Ireland: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) urges the United Kingdom and the Euro-
2
pean Union to ensure that any exit from the Euro-
3
pean Union by the United Kingdom supports contin-
4
ued peace on the island of Ireland and the prin-
5
ciples, objectives, and commitments of the Good Fri-
6
day Agreement; 
7
(2) urges a successful outcome to the dialogue 
8
between all parties in Northern Ireland to ensure 
9
that all of the institutions of the Good Friday Agree-
10
ment operate again and that ongoing political chal-
11
lenges and debates can be overcome; 
12
(3) expresses support for the full implementa-
13
tion of the Good Friday Agreement and subsequent 
14
agreements; 
15
(4) expresses opposition to the reintroduction of 
16
a hard border between the Republic of Ireland and 
17
Northern Ireland;

(5) supports the right of all the people on the

provided for in the Good Friday Agreement; and

(6) will insist that any new or amended trade

agreements and other bilateral agreements between

the Government of the United States and the Gov-
6
ernment of the United Kingdom include conditions

requiring obligations under the Good Friday Agree-
