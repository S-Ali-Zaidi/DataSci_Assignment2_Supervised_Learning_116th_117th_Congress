SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 539 IH
(1) The National Science Foundation Innova-
1
tion Corps Program (hereinafter referred to as ‘‘I- 
2
Corps’’), created administratively by the Foundation 
3
in 2011 and statutorily authorized in the American 
4
Innovation and Competitiveness Act, has succeeded 
5
in increasing the commercialization of Government- 
6
funded research. 
7
(2) I-Corps provides valuable entrepreneurial 
8
education to graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, 
9
and other researchers, providing formal training for 
10
scientists and engineers to pursue careers in busi-
11
ness, an increasingly common path for advanced de-
12
gree holders. 
13
(3) The I-Corps Teams program is successful in 
14
part due to its focus on providing the specific types 
15
of education and mentoring entrepreneurs need 
16
based on the early stage of their companies, however 
17
the program does not provide similar support to 
18
them at later stages. 
19
(4) The success of I-Corps in the very early 
20
stages of the innovation continuum should be ex-
21
panded upon by offering additional entrepreneurship 
22
training to small businesses as they advance toward 
23
commercialization.

•HR 539 IH
(5) The excellent training made available to 
1
grantees of participating agencies through the I- 
2
Corps Program should be made available to all Fed-
3
eral grantees as well as other businesses willing to 
4
pay the cost of attending such training. 
5
(6) The success of the I-Corps Program at pro-
6
moting entrepreneurship within research institutions 
7
and encouraging research commercialization has 
8
been due in part to the National Science Founda-
9
tion’s efforts to date on building a national network 
10
of science entrepreneurs, including convening stake-
11
holders, promoting national I-Corps courses, cata-
12
loguing best practices and encourage sharing be-
13
tween sites and institutions, and developing a men-
14
tor network. 
15
(7) As the I-Corps Program continues to grow 
16
and expand, the National Science Foundation should 
17
maintain its focus on networking and information 
18
sharing to ensure that innovators across the country 
19
can learn from their peers and remain competitive.
