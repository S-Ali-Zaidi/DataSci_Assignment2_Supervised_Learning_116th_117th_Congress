(b) FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.— 
10
(1) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds that— 
11
(A) energy costs for homeowners are a sig-
12
nificant and increasing portion of their house-
13
hold budgets; 
14
(B) household energy use can vary sub-
15
stantially depending on the efficiency and char-
16
acteristics of the house; 
17
(C) expected energy cost savings are im-
18
portant to the value of the house; 
19
(D) the current test for loan affordability 
20
used by most covered agencies, commonly 
21
known as the ‘‘debt-to-income’’ test, is inad-
22
equate because it does not take into account the 
23
expected energy cost savings for the homeowner 
24
of an energy efficient home; and 
25
02:54 Sep 04, 2020
H8021
16 
•HR 8021 IH
(E) another loan limitation, commonly 
1
known as the ‘‘loan-to-value’’ test, is tied to the 
2
appraisal, which often does not adjust for effi-
3
ciency features of houses. 
4
(2) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this section 
5
are to— 
6
(A) improve the accuracy of mortgage un-
7
derwriting by Federal mortgage agencies by en-
8
suring that energy cost savings are included in 
9
the underwriting process as described below, 
10
and thus to reduce the amount of energy con-
11
sumed by homes and to facilitate the creation 
12
of energy efficiency retrofit and construction 
13
jobs; 
14
(B) require a covered agency to include the 
15
expected energy cost savings of a homeowner as 
16
a regular expense in the tests, such as the debt- 
17
to-income test, used to determine the ability of 
18
the loan applicant to afford the cost of home-
19
ownership for all loan programs; and 
20
(C) require a covered agency to include the 
21
value home buyers place on the energy effi-
22
ciency of a house in tests used to compare the 
23
mortgage amount to home value, taking pre-

(1) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 1 year after 
5
the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary 
6
shall, in consultation with the advisory group estab-
7

8
lines for a covered agency to implement enhanced 
9
loan eligibility requirements, for use when testing 
10
the ability of a loan applicant to repay a covered 
11
loan, that account for the expected energy cost sav-
12
ings for a loan applicant at a subject property, in 
13
the manner set forth in paragraphs (2) and (3).

(2) REQUIREMENTS TO ACCOUNT FOR ENERGY 
15
COST SAVINGS.— 
16
(A) IN GENERAL.—The enhanced loan eli-
17
gibility requirements under paragraph (1) shall 
18
require that, for all covered loans for which an

to the mortgagee by the mortgagor, the covered 
21
agency and the mortgagee shall take into con-
22
sideration the estimated energy cost savings ex-
23
pected for the owner of the subject property in 
24
determining whether the loan applicant has suf-

3
tent that a covered agency uses a test, such as

6
property taxes, the expected energy cost savings 
7
shall be included as an offset to these expenses. 
8
(C) ASSESSED
ENERGY
COSTS.—Energy 
9
costs to be assessed include the cost of elec-
