the Inspector General determines that a facility 
3
has failed to comply with the standards under 
4
section 2 for the first time during any 2-year

6
a deficiency that threatens the health, safety, or 
7
the due process rights of detainees, the Inspec-
8
tor General shall notify the Secretary of Home-
9
land Security of such finding, and the Secretary 
10
shall—

13
ciency that threatens the health, safety, or the 
14
constitutional rights of detainees, the Inspector 
15
General shall notify the Secretary of Homeland 
16
Security of such finding, and the Secretary 
17
shall—

14 
•HR 2415 IH
(1) by amending subsection (a) to read as fol-
1
lows: 
2
‘‘(a) ARREST, DETENTION, AND RELEASE.—On a 
3
warrant issued by an immigration judge, or pursuant to 
4
section 287(a)(2), the Secretary of Homeland Security 
5
may arrest an alien, and in accordance with this section, 
6
detain the alien or release the alien on bond, subject to 
7
conditions, or recognizance, pending a decision on whether 
8
the alien is to be removed from the United States.’’; 
9
(2) by striking subsections (b), (c), (d), and (e); 
10
(3) by adding at the end the following: 
11
‘‘(b) BOND DETERMINATION.—In the case that an 
12
immigration judge makes a determination to release an 
13
alien on bond under this section, the immigration judge 
14
shall consider, for purposes of setting the amount of the 
15
bond, the alien’s financial position and ability to pay the 
16
bond without imposing financial hardship on the alien, and 
17
set bond at no amount greater than necessary to ensure 
18
the alien’s appearance for removal proceedings. 
19
‘‘(c) CUSTODY DETERMINATION.— 
20
‘‘(1) INITIAL DETERMINATION.—Not later than 
21
48 hours after taking an alien into custody under 
22
the authority provided by this section or section 235 
23
of this Act, or those subject to a reinstated order of 
24
removal pursuant to section 241(a)(5) who have 
25
00:09 May 03, 2019
H2415
15 
•HR 2415 IH
been found to have a credible or reasonable fear of 
1
return, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall 
2
make an initial custody determination with regard to 
3
that alien, and provide that determination in writing 
4
to the alien. If the Secretary determines that the re-
5
lease of an alien will not reasonably ensure the ap-
6
pearance of the alien as required or will endanger 
7
the safety of any other person or the community, the 
8
custody determination under this paragraph will im-
9
pose the least restrictive conditions, as described in 
10
paragraph (4). 
11
‘‘(2) TIMING.—If an alien seeks to challenge 
12
the initial custody determination under paragraph 
13
(1), the alien shall be provided with the opportunity 
14
for a hearing before an immigration judge to deter-
15
mine whether the alien should be detained, which 
16
hearing shall occur not later than 72 hours after the 
17
initial custody determination. 
18
‘‘(3) PRESUMPTION OF RELEASE.—In a hearing 
19
under this subsection, there shall be a presumption 
20
that the alien should be released. The Secretary of 
21
Homeland Security shall have the duty of rebutting 
22
this presumption, which may only be shown based on 
23
clear and convincing evidence, including credible and 
24
individualized information, that the use of alter-
25
00:09 May 03, 2019

•HR 2415 IH
natives to detention will not reasonably ensure the 
1
appearance of the alien at removal proceedings, or 
2
that the alien is a threat to another person or the 
3
community. The fact that an alien has a criminal 
4
charge pending against the alien may not be the sole 
5
factor to justify the continued detention of the alien. 
6
‘‘(4) LEAST
RESTRICTIVE
CONDITIONS
RE-
7
QUIRED.—If an immigration judge determines pur-
8
suant to a hearing under this section that the re-
9
lease of an alien will not reasonably ensure the ap-
10
pearance of the alien as required or will endanger 
11
the safety of any other person or the community, the 
12
immigration judge shall order the least restrictive 
13
conditions, or combination of conditions, that the 
14
judge determines will reasonably ensure the appear-
15
ance of the alien as required and the safety of any 
16
other person and the community, which may include 
17
release on recognizance, secured or unsecured re-
18
lease on bond, or participation in a program de-
19
scribed in subsection (f). Any conditions assigned to 
20
an alien pursuant to this paragraph shall be re-
21
viewed by the immigration judge on a monthly basis.
