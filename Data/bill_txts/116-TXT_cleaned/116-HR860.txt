RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the rise of cardiovascular disease as the world’s 
leading cause of preventable death and disability and 
as a global public health crisis and supporting the rec-
ognition of February 2020 as ‘‘American Heart Month’’. 
Whereas the World Health Organization estimates that in 
2017, 17.8 million people died from cardiovascular dis-
eases (referred to in this resolution as ‘‘CVDs’’) globally; 
Whereas of these deaths, 85 percent were due to heart at-
tacks and strokes, and over three-quarters of CVD deaths 
occur in low- and middle-income countries;

Whereas CVDs result in tremendous health care costs and 
lost productivity and, if not addressed, the United States 
alone will spend over $1,000,000,000 by 2035 on costs 
relating to CVD; 
Whereas the heavy burden of death and disability from CVDs 
can be decreased through changes in behavior linked to 
major risk factors, including reduced tobacco use and salt 
consumption and improvements in access to medical 
treatment and services; 
Whereas essential quality-assured medicines and technologies 
are critical components to address the global burden of 
CVDs; and 
Whereas United States leadership and support has strength-
ened surveillance, enhanced workforce capacity, and pro-
vided valuable technical exchanges with respect to the 
prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of CVD: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
