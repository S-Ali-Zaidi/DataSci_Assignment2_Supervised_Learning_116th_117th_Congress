RESOLUTION 
Recognizing ‘‘National Public Works Week’’. 
Whereas public works professionals focus on infrastructure, 
facilities, and services that are of vital importance to sus-
tainable and resilient communities and to the public 
health, high quality of life, and well-being of the United 
States of America; 
Whereas such infrastructure, facilities, and services could not 
be provided without the dedicated efforts of public works 
professionals, who are engineers, managers, and employ-
ees of Federal, State, and local government and the pri-
vate sector, and who are responsible for rebuilding, im-
proving, and protecting our Nation’s transportation, 
water supply, water treatment and solid waste systems, 
public buildings, and other structures and facilities essen-
tial for our citizens;
