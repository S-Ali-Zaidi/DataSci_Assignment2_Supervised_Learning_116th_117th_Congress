(VWP). Visitors through VWP constituted roughly 
1
1⁄3 of all temporary visitors. According to the De-
2
partment of Commerce, VWP travelers in fiscal year 
3
2014 spent approximately $84 billion on goods and 
4
services. 
5
(2) Due to the VWP, the U.S. Government 
6
saved from $1.9 billion to $3.2 billion for the cost 
7
of interviewing visitors in 2010. 
8
(3) All VWP countries are required to enter 
9
into information-sharing agreements with the United 
10
States on whether the citizens or nationals of that 
11
country traveling to the United States represent a 
12
security or criminal threat to the United States. 
13
(4) VWP countries have provided the United 
14
States with information on more than 6,000 known 
15
or suspected terrorists as a result of VWP informa-
16
tion sharing arrangements. 
17
(5) VWP countries have provided nearly 70 per-
18
cent of the records in INTERPOL’s Stolen and Lost 
19
Travel Document Database, which DHS utilizes in 
20
its daily vetting of ESTA applications and Advance

120,000 nonimmigrant visas to Polish nationals and 
1
over 50,000 nonimmigrant visas to Romanian na-
2
tionals. 
3
(7) A Fiscal Year 2017 Report by the Depart-
4
ment of Homeland Security found that the suspected 
5
in-country overstay rate was 1.17 percent for Poland 
6
and 1.19 percent for Romania. 
7
(8) Poland has taken a serious stance against 
8
terrorism in recent years. This has included with-
9
drawing from a refugee relocation plan by the EU 
10
after the 2015 Paris terror attacks. 
11
(9) Romania deployed approximately 730 troops 
12
to Afghanistan and Iraq and has signed all twelve 
13
of the international protocols and conventions per-
14
taining to terrorism. 
15
(10) Congress should continue to promote the 
16
economy and provide government agencies with the 
17
necessary resources through the VWP. The inclusion 
18
of Poland and Romania in the VWP program would 
19
contribute to program goals.
