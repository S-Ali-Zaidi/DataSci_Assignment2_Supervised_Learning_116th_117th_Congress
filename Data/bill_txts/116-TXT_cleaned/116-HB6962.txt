SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress makes the following findings: 
7
(1) Approximately 10,000,000 individuals age 
8
65 and older live in rural America today. In fact, 
9

•HR 6962 IH
one out of every 4 older adults lives in a small town 
1
or other rural area. 
2
(2) Residents of rural areas are more likely to 
3
be poorer, sicker, and have lower incomes compared 
4
to their urban counterparts. 
5
(3) According to the Office of Rural Health 
6
Policy, from 2005 to 2009, people living in rural 
7
areas had an average life expectancy of 76.8 years, 
8
a full two years less than their urban counterparts 
9
who had an average life expectancy of 78.8 years. 
10
(4) Many rural hospitals are located in areas 
11
where a majority of the population is age 65 and 
12
older and has Medicare coverage. 
13
(5) Certain State-based demonstrations to im-
14
prove payment models for rural hospitals show 
15
promise in improving healthcare, reducing costs, and 
16
integrating services for patients. 
17
(6) Experts and organizations suggest that 
18
transitioning rural hospitals to global payment sys-
19
tems would benefit patients, providers, and rural 
20
communities.
