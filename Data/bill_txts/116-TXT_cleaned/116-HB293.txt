SEC. 101. FINDINGS. 
3
The Congress finds the following: 
4
(1) Tobacco products cause numerous serious 
5
diseases, including cancer, heart disease, and res-
6
piratory disease, and they contain nicotine, a highly 
7
addictive substance. 
8
(2) According to the Surgeon General of the 
9
United States, adolescents are particularly vulner-
10
able to the adverse effects of nicotine, and adoles-
11
cent exposure to nicotine may have lasting adverse 
12
consequences for brain development. 
13
(3) Youth use of electronic cigarettes and hook-
14
ah (water pipe) has risen according to the National 
15
Youth Tobacco Survey released by the Centers for 
16
Disease Control and Prevention, and the Food and 
17
Drug Administration, in April 2015.

(4) Current use of electronic cigarettes among 
1
high school students tripled from 4.5 percent in 
2
2013 to 13.4 percent in 2014 (compared to 1.5 per-
3
cent in 2011); approximately 2,000,000 high school 
4
students currently use these products. 
5
(5) Current use of electronic cigarettes among 
6
middle school students tripled from 1.1 percent in 
7
2013 to 3.9 percent in 2014; approximately 450,000 
8
middle school students currently use these products. 
9
(6) Current use of hookah among high school 
10
students increased from 4.1 percent in 2011 to 9.4 
11
percent in 2014. 
12
(7) Current use of cigars among high school 
13
students was 8.2 percent in 2014 (1,200,000 stu-
14
dents). Current use of cigars among high school 
15
boys was 10.8 percent, about the same rate at which 
16
they smoke cigarettes (10.6 percent). 
17
(8) The sale of electronic cigarettes, cigars, 
18
hookah, and other tobacco products over the inter-
19
net, and through mail, fax, or phone orders, makes 
20
it cheaper and easier for children to obtain these 
21
products. 
22
(9) Electronic cigarettes are being marketed in 
23
ways that appeal to youth, in the form of advertising 
24
using images that appeal to youth, advertisements

(10) According to a study published in March 
4
2015 in the Journal of the American Medical Asso-
5
ciation Pediatrics, 93.7 percent of youth partici-
6
pating in a study of internet electronic cigarette

sales successfully purchased electronic cigarettes be-
