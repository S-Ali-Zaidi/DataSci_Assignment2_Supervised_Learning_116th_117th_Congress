RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for designation of May 2020 as 
‘‘National Brain Tumor Awareness Month’’. 
Whereas more than 86,000 people in the United States were 
diagnosed with a primary brain tumor last year, and an 
estimated 87,240 Americans will receive a primary brain 
tumor diagnosis in 2020; 
Whereas brain tumors are the leading cause of death from 
cancer in children under the age of 14, the leading cause 
of death from cancer for teens under the age of 19, and 
third leading cause of death from cancer in young adults 
ages 20 to 39; 
Whereas the five-year relative survival rate in the United 
States following diagnosis of a primary malignant brain 
and spinal tumor is only 36 percent;

Whereas over 18,000 people in the United States lost their 
battle with a brain tumor last year; 
Whereas brain tumors may be either malignant or benign, 
but can be life-threatening in either case; 
Whereas an estimated 700,000 people in the United States 
are currently living with a brain tumor; 
Whereas treatment of brain tumors is complicated by the fact 
that there are more than 130 different types of tumors; 
Whereas the treatment and removal of brain tumors present 
significant challenges because of the brain’s uniquely 
complex and fragile nature; 
Whereas brain tumors affect the primary organ in the human 
body that not only controls cognitive ability, but the ac-
tions of every other organ and limb in the body, leading 
to it being described as a disease that affects the essence 
of self; 
Whereas the first resolution recognizing the need for a ‘‘Na-
tional Brain Tumor Awareness Month’’ was passed by 
the House of Representatives on May 21, 2008; 
Whereas brain tumor research is supported by a number of 
private nonprofit research foundations and by institutes 
at the National Institutes of Health, including the Na-
tional Cancer Institute and National Institute for Neuro-
logical Disorders and Stroke; 
Whereas basic research advances may fuel research and de-
velopment of new treatments; 
Whereas there still remain daunting obstacles to the develop-
ment of new treatments and there are no strategies for 
screening or early detection of brain tumors;

•HRES 980 IH 
Whereas despite the number of new people diagnosed with a 
brain tumor every year, and their devastating prognosis, 
there have only been five Food and Drug Administration- 
approved drugs and one device to treat brain tumors in 
the past 30 years; 
Whereas the five approved drugs for brain tumors have pro-
vided only incremental improvements to patient survival, 
and mortality rates remain little changed over the past 
30 years; 
Whereas there is a need for greater public awareness of brain 
tumors, including the difficulties associated with research 
on these tumors and the opportunities for advances in 
brain tumor research and treatment; and 
Whereas May 2020, when brain tumor advocates nationwide 
unite in awareness, outreach, and advocacy activities, 
would be an appropriate month to recognize as ‘‘National 
Brain Tumor Awareness Month’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the designation of ‘‘National Brain 
2
Tumor Awareness Month’’; 
3
(2) encourages increased public awareness of 
4
brain tumors to honor those who have lost their lives 
5
to this devastating disease or are currently living 
6
with a brain tumor diagnosis; 
7
(3) supports efforts to develop better treat-
8
ments for brain tumors that will improve the quality 
9
of life and the long-term prognosis of those individ-
10
uals diagnosed with a brain tumor;

(4) expresses its support for those individuals

who are battling brain tumors, as well as the fami-

lies, friends, and caregivers of those individuals; and 
3
(5) urges that a collaborative public-private ap-

proach to brain tumor research is the best means of

advancing knowledge of and treatment for the dis-
