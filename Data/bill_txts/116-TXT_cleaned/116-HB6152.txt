SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
7
It is the sense of Congress that— 
8
(1) foreign investment provides substantial eco-
9
nomic benefits to the United States, including the 
10
promotion of economic growth, productivity, com-
11
petitiveness, and job creation, thereby enhancing na-
12
tional security; 
13
(2) maintaining the commitment of the United 
14
States to an open investment policy encourages 
15
other countries to reciprocate and helps open new 
16
foreign markets for United States businesses; 
17
(3) it should continue to be the policy of the 
18
United States to enthusiastically welcome and sup-
19
port foreign investment, consistent with the protec-
20
tion of national security; 
21
(4) at the same time, the national security land-
22
scape has shifted in recent years, and so has the na-
23
ture of the investments that pose the greatest poten-
24
tial risk to national security; and
