come, more highly segregated neighborhoods; 
Whereas low-income communities often have limited social 
capital and political voice;

Whereas the COVID–19 pandemic threatens to increase 
health, food, housing, and economic insecurity and push 
millions of people into poverty; 
Whereas low-income and minority communities have long ex-
perienced inadequate access to health care, housing, nu-
tritious food, and education and economic opportunity, 
which increase the prevalence of COVID–19 risk factors, 
such as diabetes, asthma, heart disease, and high blood 
pressure; and 
Whereas the COVID–19 pandemic has exposed and exacer-
bated the inequality and poverty afflicting the United 
States, as well as underlined the shortcomings of its so-
cial safety net programs: Now, therefore, be it
