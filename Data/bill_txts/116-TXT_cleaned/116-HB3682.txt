SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) From the 17th to the mid-19th centuries, 
3
the Governments of Spain and Mexico made grants 
4
of land to individuals, groups, and communities 
5
throughout the Southwest United States to promote 
6
settlement in frontier lands. 
7
(2) The key land ownership feature for a land 
8
grants-merced was common lands, meaning lands 
9
that were not individually owned but were considered 
10
‘‘commons’’ for use by all local residents to provide 
11
the necessary resources to sustain the entire commu-
12
nity. 
13
(3) On February 2, 1848, the United States 
14
and Mexico ended the Mexican-American war by 
15
signing the Treaty of Peace, Friendship, Limits, and 
16
Settlement (commonly known as the Treaty of Gua-
17
dalupe Hidalgo), in which Mexico formally relin-
18
quished to the United States claims to over 790,000 
19
square miles of land now constituting all or part of 
20
23:13 Jul 18, 2019
H3682

•HR 3682 IH
Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, 
1
Texas, Utah, and Wyoming. 
2
(4) The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo included 
3
provisions under article VIII for the protection of es-
4
tablished property rights, including community land 
5
grants located in the new territories, and the United 
6
States and Mexico further affirmed these protections 
7
in the Protocol of Queretaro. 
8
(5) Although the Senate struck article X of the 
9
Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo as negotiated, the 
10
United States clarified in the subsequent Protocol of 
11
Queretaro that ‘‘these grants . . . preserve the legal 
12
value which they may possess’’ and the grantees in 
13
the new territories retained their property rights. 
14
(6) As noted by the Government Accountability 
15
Office in the 2001 report GAO–01–951, ‘‘The Pro-
16
tocol specified the United States’ position that land 
17
grant titles would be protected under the treaty and 
18
that grantees could have their ownership of land ac-
19
knowledged before American tribunals.’’. 
20
(7) In the second half of the 19th century, the 
21
United States enacted various laws establishing 
22
processes to review property claims in the new terri-
23
tories, such as the Act of July 22, 1854 (10 Stat. 
24
308; ch. 103), that created the office of Surveyor 
25
23:13 Jul 18, 2019
H3682

•HR 3682 IH
General of New Mexico and the Act of March 3, 
1
1891 (26 Stat. 854; ch. 539), that created the Court 
2
of Private Land Claims. 
3
(8) The established processes differed from 
4
State to State, and a history of problematic surveys 
5
and corruption may explain why there was so much 
6
acreage lost by community land grants and why so 
7
few survived into modern times as self-governing en-
8
tities administering intact common lands. 
9
(9) Studies have concluded that for land grant 
10
communities and community members to survive in 
11
the non-cash economies prior to the mid-20th cen-
12
tury, it was essential that they have access to the 
13
common land resources of their own private 
14
inholdings, which provided a complete resource base 
15
for successful small-scale family farming and stock- 
16
raising activities, upon which the local economy was 
17
based. 
18
(10) New Mexico’s community land grants, now 
19
known as land grant-mercedes, are an important 
20
part of the State’s culture and history and have been 
21
recognized under the Kearny Code of 1846 and sub-
22
sequent territorial laws of New Mexico and New 
23
Mexico State law.

(11) Article 2, section 5 of the constitution of 
1
New Mexico states, ‘‘The rights, privileges and im-
2
munities, civil, political and religious guaranteed to 
3
the people of New Mexico by the Treaty of Guada-
4
lupe Hidalgo shall be preserved inviolate’’, providing 
5
powerful constitutional protection for the rights of 
6
the State’s land grant communities. 
7
(12) Water delivery systems known as acequias, 
8
or community ditches, are a centuries-old system 
9
used for water distribution, introduced to New Mex-
10
ico by the Spanish in the 16th century, to allow for 
11
farming to sustain the needs of the community, cre-
12
ating a cultural landscape and way of life centered 
13
around local agriculture. 
14
(13) In New Mexico, acequias are governed by 
15
a centuries-old form of water governance, known as 
16
acequias, that are political subdivisions of the State 
17
and are composed of a board of private land owners 
18
that are responsible for the upkeep and maintenance 
19
of the acequias and for monitoring and admin-
20
istering surface water rights along the acequia. 
21
(14) In New Mexico, acequias have created a 
22
cultural landscape and way of life centered around 
23
local agriculture, water governance, and a custom of 
24
sharing scarce water.
