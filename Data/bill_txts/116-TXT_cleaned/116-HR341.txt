Whereas bladder cancer symptoms, such as blood in the 
urine, are easily recognized, however, many are unaware 
of the threat of bladder cancer, often prolonging time to 
diagnosis; 
Whereas if diagnosed early, bladder cancer is treatable; 
Whereas military veterans are twice as likely as non-veterans 
to be diagnosed with bladder cancer; 
Whereas women are often diagnosed at a later stage in the 
development of bladder cancer, and when diagnosed at 
the same stage as men, women have a worse prognosis; 
Whereas if diagnosis and treatment are delayed, the life ex-
pectancy of an individual with bladder cancer decreases; 
Whereas the quality of life of a person with bladder cancer 
will depend on future treatment and diagnosis develop-
ments, which will rely on research advancements; 
Whereas there have been few new treatments developed for 
bladder cancer in more than 20 years; 
Whereas research advancements for bladder cancer are lim-
ited by lack of awareness about the disease within the 
medical community and general public; 
Whereas increased awareness will promote early diagnosis 
and increase chances of survival; 
Whereas increased awareness will bolster public support of 
the disease and thus increase funding for innovative re-
search and the development of new treatment options and 
diagnostic tools; 
Whereas traditionally, throughout May, survivors, caregivers, 
and loved ones walk together throughout the United 
States to raise awareness of bladder cancer;
