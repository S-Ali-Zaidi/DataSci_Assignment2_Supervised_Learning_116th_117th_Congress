SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
3
Congress finds the following: 
4
(1) The United States Armed Forces represent 
5
the finest fighting force in the world. 
6
(2) An interruption in compensation could af-
7
fect morale and cause hardship which would threat-
8
en United States security and the safety of our 
9
troops. 
10
(3) It is a vital national interest that the 
11
United States Armed Forces, including reserve com-
12
ponents, can operate with the assurance that they 
13
will continue to receive pay and allowances for their 
14
service if a funding gap occurs. 
15
(4) Federal law enforcement officers are highly 
16
trained and dedicated men and women, committed to 
17
protecting liberty, public safety, and the security of 
18
our Nation from both foreign and domestic threats. 
19
(5) They have no equal in the private sector, 
20
and perform a role that is both unique and vital to 
21
the continuing operation of the Federal Government 
22
and commerce during times of crisis. 
23
(6) Each and every day, Federal law enforce-
24
ment officers are engaged around the clock in activi-

ties that include, but are not limited to, dignitary 
1
protection, criminal investigation, homeland security, 
2
border security, intelligence gathering, and fighting 
3
waste, fraud and abuse. 
4
(7) These critical Government functions cannot 
5
be interrupted due to an absence of congressional 
6
appropriations or during periods of a Government 
7
shutdown, nor can we expect that the threats posed 
8
by violent criminals, terrorists and America’s en-
9
emies will lessen during such periods of fiscal uncer-
10
tainty.
