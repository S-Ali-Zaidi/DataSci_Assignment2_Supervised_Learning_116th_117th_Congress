cent of whom have been charged with nonviolent 
1
crimes. 
2
(2) Under current bail systems that use pay-
3
ment of money as a condition of pretrial release, 
4
nearly 50 percent of the most dangerous pretrial de-
5
tainees are released without supervision, according 
6
to a study by the Arnold Foundation. 
7
(3) Throughout the Nation, those with money 
8
can buy their freedom while poor defendants remain 
9
incarcerated awaiting trial. 
10
(4) Pretrial detention costs State and local gov-
11
ernments an estimated $14,000,000,000 each year. 
12
(5) Pretrial detention should be based on 
13
whether the accused is likely to fail to appear in 
14
court or is a threat to public safety, not the ability 
15
to pay money as a condition of pretrial release. 
16
(6) The States, the United States Department 
17
of Justice, law enforcement agencies, public officials, 
18
and community groups should collaborate to develop 
19
pretrial detention systems that improve public safe-
20
ty, reduce costs, and discourage criminal behavior.
