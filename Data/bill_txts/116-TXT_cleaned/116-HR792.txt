RESOLUTION 
Supporting the contributions of Catholic schools. 
Whereas Catholic schools in the United States are inter-
nationally acclaimed for their academic excellence and 
provide students with more than an exceptional scholastic 
education; 
Whereas Catholic schools instill a broad, values-added edu-
cation emphasizing the lifelong development of moral, in-
tellectual, physical, and social values in young people in 
the United States; 
Whereas Catholic schools serve the Nation by providing a di-
verse student population from all regions of the country 
and all socioeconomic backgrounds a strong academic and 
moral foundation, including 39 percent of students from

racial and ethnic minority backgrounds and 19 percent 
from non-Catholic families; 
Whereas Catholic schools are an affordable option for par-
ents, particularly in underserved urban areas; 
Whereas Catholic schools produce students strongly dedicated 
to their faith, values, families, and communities by pro-
viding an intellectually stimulating environment rich in 
spiritual, character, and moral development; 
Whereas Catholic schools are committed to community serv-
ice, producing graduates who hold ‘‘helping others’’ 
among their core values; 
Whereas the total Catholic school student enrollment for the 
2018–2019 academic year was almost 1,800,000 and the 
student-teacher ratio was 12 to 1; 
Whereas the Catholic high school graduation rate is 99 per-
cent, with 86 percent of graduates attending 4-year col-
leges; 
Whereas in the 2005 pastoral message ‘‘Renewing Our Com-
mitment to Catholic Elementary and Secondary Schools 
in the Third Millennium’’, the United States Conference 
of Catholic Bishops stated, ‘‘Catholic schools are often 
the Church’s most effective contribution to those families 
who are poor and disadvantaged, especially in poor inner 
city neighborhoods and rural areas. Catholic schools cul-
tivate healthy interaction among the increasingly diverse 
populations of our society. In cities and rural areas, 
Catholic schools are often the only opportunity for eco-
nomically disadvantaged young people to receive an edu-
cation of quality that speaks to the development of the 
whole person. Our Catholic schools have produced count-

less numbers of well-educated and moral citizens who are 
leaders in our civic and ecclesial communities.’’; 
Whereas the week of January 26, 2020, to February 1, 2020, 
has been designated as National Catholic Schools Week 
by the National Catholic Educational Association and the 
United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, and Janu-
ary 29, 2020, has been designated National Appreciation 
Day for Catholic Schools; 
Whereas the National Catholic Schools Week was first estab-
lished in 1974 and has been celebrated annually for the 
past 46 years; 
Whereas 30 percent of Catholic schools have waiting lists for 
admission and new schools are opening across the coun-
try; and 
Whereas the theme for National Catholic Schools Week 2020 
is Catholic Schools: Learn. Serve. Lead. Succeed: Now, 
therefore, be it
