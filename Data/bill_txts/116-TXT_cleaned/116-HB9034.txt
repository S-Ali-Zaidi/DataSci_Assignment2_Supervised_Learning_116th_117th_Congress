A BILL 
To amend the Competitive, Special, and Facilities Grant 
Act to include agricultural climate adaptation and miti-
gation as a priority area addressed by the Agriculture 
and Food Research Initiative, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Research to Reduce

Congress makes the following findings:

(1) Greenhouse gasses, including carbon diox-
1
ide, methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gasses, 
2
are gasses that trap heat in the atmosphere. 
3
(2) Global climate change is widely attributed 
4
to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gasses in 
5
our atmosphere. 
6
(3) According to the Global Carbon Project, 
7
methane (CH4) is the second highest greenhouse gas 
8
contributing to human-induced climate change. 
9
Methane has a significantly larger global warming 
10
potential than carbon dioxide. 
11
(4) According to EPA’s 2018 Inventory of U.S. 
12
Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks, enteric fer-
13
mentation was the largest anthropogenic source of 
14
methane in the United States representing 28 per-
15
cent of domestic methane emissions. 
16
(5) Ruminants, hooved, four legged mammals 
17
that possess stomachs with four compartments, such 
18
as cattle, buffaloes, sheep and goats, produce meth-
19
ane through enteric fermentation, their normal di-
20
gestive process, and manure management and have 
21
the highest methane emissions per unit of body mass 
22
among all animal types. 
23
(6) Many factors influence methane emissions 
24
from livestock including, level of feed intake, type of 
25

carbohydrate in the diet, feed processing, and 
1
changes in the animal’s microbiome. 
2
(7) Multiple peer review studies have indicated 
3
enormous methane mitigation potential of feed addi-
4
tives, including seaweed. 
5
(8) Farming practices, including methods to re-
6
duce methane emissions from livestock, hold enor-
7
mous potential to address climate change. 
8
(9) Farmers and growers are leading stewards 
9
of the land and are on the front lines experiencing 
10
the immediate impacts of climate change.
