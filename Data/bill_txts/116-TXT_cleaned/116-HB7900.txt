A BILL 
To amend the National Organ Transplant Act to clarify 
the definition of valuable consideration, to clarify that 
pilot programs that honor and promote organ donation 
do not violate that Act, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Organ Donation Clari-
4
fication Act of 2020’’.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 7900 IH
(1) As of June 2020, 111,000 people await an 
1
organ transplant, with 93,000 of those people wait-
2
ing for a kidney, and average wait times are ap-
3
proaching five years for a kidney, with nearly twice 
4
as many people being added to the waiting lists as 
5
getting a transplant. 
6
(2) Of the roughly two million Americans who 
7
die annually, only 10,500 to 13,800, representing 
8
less than one percent of all deaths each year, possess 
9
major organs healthy enough for transplanting. 
10
(3) On average, 22 people a day died while 
11
waiting for an organ in 2019, with the majority of 
12
those people waiting for a kidney. 
13
(4) In 2019, approximately 4,200 people were 
14
removed from kidney waiting lists and approximately 
15
1,700 from liver, heart, and lungs waiting lists be-
16
cause they became permanently too sick to receive a 
17
transplant. 
18
(5) Ninety percent of dialysis patients are not 
19
employed because dialysis requires multiple treat-
20
ments per week which last several hours and leave 
21
patients drained, thus creating a huge financial bur-
22
den on the patients, their families, and the govern-
23
ment; moreover, lost tax revenue from these individ-
24
uals is not included in the cost estimates above, and 
25

which can help lead to as few as 10 percent of dialy-
1
sis patients being employed. 
2
(6) A patient receiving a kidney transplant, and 
3
thus no longer needing dialysis, can enjoy a much 
4
higher quality of life for another 10–15 years on av-
5
erage. 
6
(7) As medical advances extend people’s lives on 
7
dialysis, the number of patients on dialysis will in-
8
crease significantly, as will the costs for individuals 
9
and the Federal Government. 
10
(8) Roughly seven percent of the Medicare 
11
budget goes to the End Stage Renal Disease Pro-
12
gram, with dialysis costing Medicare over $90,000 
13
per patient per year, as Federal law dictates that 
14
Medicare will cover dialysis for everyone who has 
15
made minimal Social Security tax payments. 
16
(9) A kidney transplant pays for itself in less 
17
than two years, with each transplant saving an aver-
18
age of over $700,000 in medical costs over a 10-year 
19
period, 85 percent of which is savings to the tax-
20
payers. 
21
(10) Experts project that if the supply of trans-
22
plant kidneys could be increased to meet the de-
23
mand, 
taxpayers 
would 
save 
more 
than 
24
$12,000,000,000 per year in medical costs.

•HR 7900 IH
(11) The World Health Organization estimates 
1
that 10 percent of all transplants take place on the 
2
international black market, the last choice for des-
3
perate patients facing an alternative of death, how-
4
ever recipients often receive infected kidneys and 
5
suffer poor health outcomes and donors are often 
6
victimized. 
7
(12) Present policy on domestic donation has 
8
never been subject to studies or pilots to determine 
9
effectiveness in increasing the availability of donated 
10
organs and the effectiveness of safeguards that pre-
11
vent coercion or exploitation, precludes all but altru-
12
istic donation, prohibiting any form of incentive or 
13
benefit for donors. 
14
(13) In 2010, Israel implemented sweeping 
15
changes to its national organ donation program in-
16
cluding reducing financial burdens on donors, giving 
17
future transplantation priority to registered organ 
18
donors and their families, and promoting donation 
19
by reimbursing the donor’s medical costs, 40 days of 
20
lost wages, and five years of medical and life insur-
21
ance costs, and as a result saw organ donation ap-
22
proximately triple over a 10-year period. 
23
(14) Experts are arriving at a consensus that 
24
trials are necessary to find new methods of pro-

moting additional organ donation which will save

lives and reduce organ trafficking.
