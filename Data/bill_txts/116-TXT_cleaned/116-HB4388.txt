SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) According to the National Human Traf-
3
ficking Hotline, operated by the National Human 
4
Trafficking Resource Center, there is no single pro-
5
file for trafficking survivors—trafficking survivors 
6
include adults and minors from rural, suburban, and 
7
urban communities across the country. Survivors of 
8
human trafficking have diverse socioeconomic back-
9
grounds, varied levels of education, and may be doc-
10
umented or undocumented. According to the 2018 
11
Trafficking In Persons Report produced by the De-
12
partment of State, the Department of Justice, the 
13
National Human Trafficking Resource Center, and 
14
Youth.gov, vulnerable populations and risk factors 
15
for human trafficking include— 
16
(A) children in the child welfare and juve-
17
nile justice systems; 
18
(B) runaway youth; 
19
(C) homeless youth; 
20
(D) youth forced to leave home by parents 
21
or caregivers with no alternate care arranged; 
22
(E) unaccompanied children; 
23
(F) American Indians and Alaska Natives; 
24

•HR 4388 IH
(G) migrant laborers, including undocu-
1
mented workers and individuals with temporary 
2
visas; 
3
(H) recent migration or relocation; 
4
(I) persons with disabilities; 
5
(J) LGBTI individuals; 
6
(K) people of color; 
7
(L) those with limited-English proficiency; 
8
(M) low literacy; 
9
(N) substance abuse; 
10
(O) mental health issues; 
11
(P) past trauma or violence; 
12
(Q) stigma or discrimination; 
13
(R) family conflict, disruption, or dysfunc-
14
tion; 
15
(S) community-level risk factors such as 
16
peer pressure, social norms, social isolation, 
17
gang involvement, and living in an under- 
18
resourced school, neighborhood, or community; 
19
and 
20
(T) society-level risk factors such as lack 
21
of awareness of commercial exploitation and 
22
human trafficking, sexualization of children, 
23
and lack of resources.

•HR 4388 IH
(2) According to the National Human Traf-
1
ficking Resource Center, human trafficking survivors 
2
have been identified in cities, suburbs, and rural 
3
areas in all 50 States, and in Washington, DC. The 
4
3 States with the highest incidents of human traf-
5
ficking cases reported via phone calls, emails, and 
6
online tips to the National Human Trafficking Hot-
7
line in 2018 were California, Texas, and Florida, re-
8
spectively. 
9
(3) According to the National Human Traf-
10
ficking Resource Center, the top recruitment meth-
11
ods used by sex traffickers based on self-reported 
12
data from survivors involve an intimate partner or 
13
marriage proposition, family members, individuals 
14
posing as a benefactor, offers of employment, or in-
15
dividuals perpetrating fraud or offering false prom-
16
ises. 
17
(4) According to the National Center on Safe 
18
Supportive Learning Environments, traffickers may 
19
systematically target vulnerable children by fre-
20
quenting locations where children congregate—malls, 
21
schools, bus and train stations, and group homes, 
22
among other locations. Traffickers also use peers or 
23
classmates who befriend the target and slowly groom 
24
the child for the trafficker by bringing the child 
25

along to parties and other activities. According to 
1
Common Sense Media, nearly all children age 8 and 
2
under live in a home with some type of mobile device 
3
and use it every day. This is especially concerning 
4
given that traffickers often recruit through social 
5
media platforms and other websites. 
6
(5) Those within vulnerable populations are 
7
often exploited or groomed for entry into human 
8
trafficking at a very young age. According to a 2005 
9
clinical report, ‘‘The Evaluation of Sexual Abuse in 
10
Children’’, published by the American Academy of 
11
Pediatrics, studies have suggested that each year ap-
12
proximately 739,000 children experience some form 
13
of sexual abuse, resulting in the sexual victimization 
14
of 12 percent to 25 percent of girls and 8 percent 
15
to 10 percent of boys before the age of 18. 
16
(6) Sex trafficking and exploitation can take 
17
many harmful forms, including a lesser-known but 
18
just as damaging form of uncoerced exploitation re-
19
ferred to as ‘‘survival sex’’, meaning the exchange of 
20
sex for basic needs including clothing, food, shelter, 
21
or other basic necessities. Survival sex does not in-
22
volve a third-party trafficker or exploiter, and often 
23
affects youth, including those who are homeless, 
24
runaways, or housing-insecure, who lack the finan-
25

•HR 4388 IH
cial resources, job readiness, support system, or op-
1
portunity to afford or access these basic necessities. 
2
(7) Training students, teachers, and school per-
3
sonnel to understand, recognize, and respond to 
4
signs of human trafficking and exploitation in chil-
5
dren and youth is invaluable in the effort to identify 
6
and prevent human trafficking and exploitation be-
7
fore it occurs. According to the National Human 
8
Trafficking Resource Center, the widespread lack of 
9
awareness and understanding of human trafficking 
10
leads to low levels of survivor identification by the 
11
people who most often encounter them. Survivors of 
12
human trafficking are often forced to work or pro-
13
vide commercial sex against their will in legal and le-
14
gitimate business settings or underground markets. 
15
It is often the case that those who are being ex-
16
ploited or trafficked are in plain view and may inter-
17
act with community members, underscoring the ur-
18
gent need for the expansion of training programs to 
19
increase awareness and prevention activities in com-
20
munities across the United States.
