SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
5
Congress makes the following findings: 
6
(1) The Joint Declaration and the Basic Law 
7
clarify certain obligations and promises that the 
8
Government of China has made with respect to the 
9
future of Hong Kong. 
10
(2) The obligations of the Government of China 
11
under the Joint Declaration were codified in a le-
12
gally-binding treaty, signed by the Government of 
13
the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern 
14
Ireland and registered with the United Nations. 
15
(3) The obligations of the Government of China 
16
under the Basic Law originate from the Joint Dec-
17
laration, were passed into the domestic law of China 
18
by the National People’s Congress, and are widely 
19
considered by citizens of Hong Kong as part of the 
20
de facto legal constitution of Hong Kong. 
21
(4) Foremost among the obligations of the Gov-
22
ernment of China to Hong Kong is the promise that, 
23
pursuant to Paragraph 3b of the Joint Declaration, 
24
‘‘the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will 
25
6 
•HR 7440 EH
enjoy a high degree of autonomy, except in foreign 
1
and defence affairs which are the responsibilities of 
2
the Central People’s Government’’. 
3
(5) The obligation specified in Paragraph 3b of 
4
the Joint Declaration is referenced, reinforced, and 
5
extrapolated on in several portions of the Basic Law, 
6
including Articles 2, 12, 13, 14, and 22. 
7
(6) Article 22 of the Basic Law establishes that 
8
‘‘No department of the Central People’s Government 
9
and no province, autonomous region, or municipality 
10
directly under the Central Government may interfere 
11
in the affairs which the Hong Kong Special Admin-
12
istrative Region administers on its own in accord-
13
ance with this Law.’’. 
14
(7) The Joint Declaration and the Basic Law 
15
make clear that additional obligations shall be un-
16
dertaken by China to ensure the ‘‘high degree of au-
17
tonomy’’ of Hong Kong. 
18
(8) Paragraph 3c of the Joint Declaration 
19
states, as reinforced by Articles 2, 16, 17, 18, 19, 
20
and 22 of the Basic Law, that Hong Kong ‘‘will be 
21
vested with executive, legislative and independent ju-
22
dicial power, including that of final adjudication’’. 
23
(9) On multiple occasions, the Government of 
24
China has undertaken actions that have contravened 
25
7 
•HR 7440 EH
the letter or intent of the obligation described in 
1
paragraph (8) of this section, including the fol-
2
lowing: 
3
(A) In 1999, the Standing Committee of 
4
the National People’s Congress overruled a de-
5
cision by the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal 
6
on the right of abode. 
7
(B) On multiple occasions, the Government 
8
of Hong Kong, at the advice of the Government 
9
of China, is suspected to have not allowed per-
10
sons entry into Hong Kong allegedly because of 
11
their support for democracy and human rights 
12
in Hong Kong and China. 
13
(C) The Liaison Office of China in Hong 
14
Kong has, despite restrictions on interference in 
15
the affairs of Hong Kong as detailed in Article 
16
22 of the Basic Law— 
17
(i) openly expressed support for can-
18
didates in Hong Kong for Chief Executive 
19
and Legislative Council; 
20
(ii) expressed views on various policies 
21
for the Government of Hong Kong and 
22
other internal matters relating to Hong 
23
Kong; and 
24
8 
•HR 7440 EH
(iii) on April 17, 2020, asserted that 
1
both the Liaison Office of China in Hong 
2
Kong and the Hong Kong and Macau Af-
3
fairs Office of the State Council ‘‘have the 
4
right to exercise supervision . . . on affairs 
5
regarding Hong Kong and the mainland, 
6
in order to ensure correct implementation 
7
of the Basic Law’’. 
8
(D) The National People’s Congress has 
9
passed laws requiring Hong Kong to pass laws 
10
banning disrespectful treatment of the national 
11
flag and national anthem of China. 
12
(E) The State Council of China released a 
13
white paper on June 10, 2014, that stressed 
14
the ‘‘comprehensive jurisdiction’’ of the Govern-
15
ment of China over Hong Kong and indicated 
16
that Hong Kong must be governed by ‘‘patri-
17
ots’’. 
18
(F) The Government of China has directed 
19
operatives to kidnap and bring to the mainland, 
20
or is otherwise responsible for the kidnapping 
21
of, residents of Hong Kong, including business-
22
man Xiao Jianhua and bookseller Gui Minhai. 
23
(G) The Government of Hong Kong, acting 
24
with the support of the Government of China, 
25
9 
•HR 7440 EH
introduced an extradition bill that would have 
1
permitted the Government of China to request 
2
and enforce extradition requests for any indi-
3
vidual present in Hong Kong, regardless of the 
4
legality of the request or the degree to which it 
5
compromised the judicial independence of Hong 
6
Kong. 
7
(H) The spokesman for the Standing Com-
8
mittee of the National People’s Congress said, 
9
‘‘Whether Hong Kong’s laws are consistent 
10
with the Basic Law can only be judged and de-
11
cided by the National People’s Congress Stand-
12
ing Committee. No other authority has the 
13
right to make judgments and decisions.’’. 
14
(10) Paragraph 3e of the Joint Declaration 
15
states, as reinforced by Article 5 of the Basic Law, 
16
that the ‘‘current social and economic systems in 
17
Hong Kong will remain unchanged, as so will the 
18
life-style.’’. 
19
(11) On multiple occasions, the Government of 
20
China has undertaken actions that have contravened 
21
the letter or intent of the obligation described in 
22

23
lowing: 
24
10

1
pressured the Government of Hong Kong to in-
2
troduce ‘‘patriotic’’ curriculum in primary and 
3
secondary schools. 
4
(B) The governments of China and Hong 
5
Kong proposed the prohibition of discussion of 
6
Hong Kong independence and self-determina-
7
tion in primary and secondary schools, which 
8
infringes on freedom of speech. 
9
(C) The Government of Hong Kong man-
10
dated that Mandarin, and not the native lan-
11
guage of Cantonese, be the language of instruc-
12
tion in Hong Kong schools. 
13
(D) The governments of China and Hong 
14
Kong agreed to a daily quota of mainland im-
15
migrants to Hong Kong, which is widely be-
16
lieved by citizens of Hong Kong to be part of 
17
an effort to ‘‘mainlandize’’ Hong Kong. 
18
(12) Paragraph 3e of the Joint Declaration 
19
states, as reinforced by Articles 4, 26, 27, 28, 29, 
20
30, 31, 32 33, 34, and 39 of the Basic Law, that 
21
the ‘‘rights and freedoms, including those of person, 
22

3
China has undertaken actions that have contravened 
4
the letter or intent of the obligation described in 
5
paragraph (12) of this section, including the fol-
6
lowing: 
7
(A) On February 26, 2003, the Govern-
8
ment of Hong Kong introduced a national secu-
9
rity bill that would have placed restrictions on 
10
freedom of speech and other protected rights. 
11
(B) The Liaison Office of China in Hong 
12

16
(C) The Hong Kong Police Force selec-
17

22

•HR 7440 EH
(E) The Justice Department of Hong 
1
Kong selectively prosecuted cases against lead-
2

4
sive force during the protests in 2014. 
5
(F) On April 18, 2020, the Hong Kong 
6
Police Force arrested 14 high-profile democracy 
7
activists and campaigners for their role in orga-
8
nizing a protest march that took place on Au-
9
gust 18, 2019, in which almost 2,000,000 peo-
10
ple rallied against a proposed extradition bill. 
11
(14) Articles 45 and 68 of the Basic Law assert 
12
that the selection of Chief Executive and all mem-
13
bers of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong should 
14
be by ‘‘universal suffrage.’’. 
15
(15) On multiple occasions, the Government of 
16
China has undertaken actions that have contravened 
17
the letter or intent of the obligation described in 
18
paragraph (14) of this section, including the fol-
19
lowing: 
20
(A) In 2004, the National People’s Con-
21
gress created new, antidemocratic procedures 
22
restricting the adoption of universal suffrage

for the election of the Chief Executive of Hong 
24
Kong.

•HR 7440 EH

14
(E) In 2018, the Government of Hong 
15
Kong banned the Hong Kong National Party 
16
and blocked the candidacy of pro-democracy 
17
candidates. 
18
(16) The ways in which the Government of 
19
China, at times with the support of a subservient 
20
Government of Hong Kong, has acted in contraven-
21
tion of its obligations under the Joint Declaration 
22
and the Basic Law, as set forth in this section, are 
23
deeply concerning to the people of Hong Kong, the

SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING HONG KONG. 
3
It is the sense of Congress that— 
4
(1) the United States continues to uphold the 
5
principles and policy established in the United 
6
States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 (22 U.S.C. 
7
5701 et seq.) and the Hong Kong Human Rights 
8
and Democracy Act of 2019 (Public Law 116–76; 
9
22 U.S.C. 5701 note), which remain consistent with 
10
China’s obligations under the Joint Declaration and 
11
certain promulgated objectives under the Basic Law, 
12
including that— 
13
(A) as set forth in section 101(1) of the 
14
United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 
15
(22 U.S.C. 5711(1)), ‘‘The United States 
16
should play an active role, before, on, and after 
17
July 1, 1997, in maintaining Hong Kong’s con-
18
fidence and prosperity, Hong Kong’s role as an 
19
international financial center, and the mutually 
20
beneficial ties between the people of the United 
21
States and the people of Hong Kong.’’; and 
22
(B) as set forth in section 2(5) of the 
23
United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 
24
(22 U.S.C. 5701(5)), ‘‘Support for democratiza-
25
15 
•HR 7440 EH
tion is a fundamental principle of United States 
1
foreign policy. As such, it naturally applies to 
2
United States policy toward Hong Kong. This 
3
will remain equally true after June 30, 1997.’’; 
4
(2) although the United States recognizes that, 
5
under the Joint Declaration, the Government of 
6
China ‘‘resumed the exercise of sovereignty over 
7
Hong Kong with effect on 1 July 1997’’, the United 
8
States supports the autonomy of Hong Kong in fur-
9
therance of the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act 
10
of 1992 and the Hong Kong Human Rights and De-
11
mocracy Act of 2019 and advances the desire of the 
12
people of Hong Kong to continue the ‘‘one country, 
13
two systems’’ regime, in addition to other obligations 
14
promulgated by China under the Joint Declaration 
15
and the Basic Law; 
16
(3) in order to support the benefits and protec-
17
tions that Hong Kong has been afforded by the Gov-
18
ernment of China under the Joint Declaration and 
19
the Basic Law, the United States should establish a 
20
clear and unambiguous set of penalties with respect 
21
to foreign persons determined by the Secretary of 
22
State, in consultation with the Secretary of the 
23
Treasury, to be involved in the contravention of the 
24
obligations of China under the Joint Declaration and 
25
16 
•HR 7440 EH
the Basic Law and the financial institutions 
1
transacting with those foreign persons; 
2
(4) the Secretary of State should provide an un-
3
classified assessment of the reason for imposition of 
4
certain economic penalties on entities, so as to per-
5
mit a clear path for the removal of economic pen-
6
alties if the sanctioned behavior is reversed and 
7
verified by the Secretary of State; 
8
(5) relevant Federal agencies should establish a 
9
multilateral sanctions regime with respect to foreign 
10
persons involved in the contravention of the obliga-
11
tions of China under the Joint Declaration and the 
12
Basic Law; and 
13
(6) in addition to the penalties on foreign per-
14
sons, and financial institutions transacting with 
15
those foreign persons, for the contravention of the 
16
obligations of China under the Joint Declaration and 
17
the Basic Law, the United States should take steps, 
18
in a time of crisis, to assist permanent residents of 
19
Hong Kong who are persecuted or fear persecution 
20
as a result of the contravention by China of its obli-
21
gations under the Joint Declaration and the Basic 
22
Law to become eligible to obtain lawful entry into 
23
the United States.
