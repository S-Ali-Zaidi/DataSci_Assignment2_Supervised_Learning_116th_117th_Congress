SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Allergies, when not properly diagnosed, can-
3
not be effectively treated. 
4
(2) Allergies to food, inhaled particles, or other 
5
sources can cause debilitating and, in some cases, 
6
fatal reactions. 
7
(3) Allergies can substantially compound other 
8
illnesses, including asthma, emphysema, and adult 
9
obstructive pulmonary diseases, leading to social and 
10
economic costs for families and our Nation’s health 
11
care system. 
12
(4) According to clinical guidelines from the 
13
National Institutes of Health and recommendations 
14
from peer-reviewed literature, in vitro specific IgE 
15
tests and percutaneous tests are considered equiva-
16
lent as confirmatory tests in terms of their sensi-
17
tivity and accuracy. 
18
(5) Despite these recommendations, some cur-
19
rent Medicare local coverage determinations and 
20
Medicaid coverage policies deny equal access to in 
21
vitro specific IgE tests and percutaneous tests. 
22
(6) In vitro specific IgE tests and percutaneous 
23
tests must be equally accessible for clinicians and 
24
patients to improve health outcomes, reduce system
