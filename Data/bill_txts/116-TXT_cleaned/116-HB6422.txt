SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Throughout our Nation’s history, national 
3
banks have played a crucial role in financing our 
4
Nation’s public infrastructure, which in turn contrib-
5
uted to the United States becoming the world’s lead-
6
ing producing nation. 
7
(2) Canals, the Transcontinental Railroad, the 
8
Hoover Dam, rural electrification, and the national 
9
system of roads and bridges are all examples of in-
10
vestments in infrastructure that created the condi-
11
tions for improved productivity, job creation, and 
12
economic growth. 
13
(3) Four previous national banks financed such 
14
infrastructure, each according to a development 
15
plan: The First (1791–1811) and Second (1816– 
16
1836) Banks of the United States, President Lin-
17
coln’s national banking system, and President 
18
Franklin Roosevelt’s Reconstruction Finance Cor-
19
poration (1932–1957). 
20
(4) However, according to the American Society 
21
of Civil Engineers (ASCE) in a 2017 report, the 
22
current condition of the infrastructure in the United 
23
States earns a grade point average of D+, and an 
24
estimated $4,590,000,000,000 investment is needed

by 2025 to bring the following systems to a state of 
1
good repair (amounts in parentheses): 
2
(A) 
Roads, 
bridges, 
and 
transit 
3
($2,042,000,000,000). 
4
(B) Electricity grids ($934,000,000,000). 
5
(C) Schools ($870,000,000,000). 
6
(D) Dams, levees, waterways, and ports 
7
($162,000,000,000). 
8
(E) Airports ($157,000,000,000). 
9
(F) Rail ($154,000,000,000). 
10
(G) Drinking water and wastewater sys-
11
tems ($150,000,000,000). 
12
(H) 
Public 
parks 
and 
recreation 
13
($114,000,000,000). 
14
(I) 
Hazardous 
and 
solid 
waste 
15
($7,000,000,000). 
16
(5) In addition, expanded investment is needed 
17
in new manufacturing centers, affordable housing, 
18
broadband access, science and technology drivers, to 
19
accommodate population growth and migration, and 
20
for other improvements in rural, urban, and low-in-
21
come areas that the private sector is not currently 
22
serving. 
23
(6) Although Federal grant programs, along 
24
with matching State and local funding, should con-
25

•HR 6422 IH
tinue to play a central role in financing infrastruc-
1
ture in the United States, current and foreseeable 
2
demands on existing Federal, State, and local budg-
3
ets exceed the resources to support these programs 
4
by a wide margin. ASCE estimates that funds are 
5
available for only about half of the infrastructure it 
6
currently monitors. Meanwhile, long-term savers, in-
7
cluding central banks, pension funds, corporations, 
8
sovereign wealth funds, and insurance companies, 
9
have a growing interest in infrastructure investment. 
10
(7) The establishment of a United States public 
11
deposit money bank would provide direct loans and 
12
other financing of up to $4,000,000,000,000 for 
13
qualifying infrastructure projects. Such funding 
14
would be adequate to finance all of the United 
15
States identified infrastructure needs, in all parts of 
16
the country, according to strategic plans. At the 
17
same time, it would return the United States to its 
18
most recent ‘‘golden age’’ when a National Infra-
19
structure Bank was in place (1933–1957), during 
20
which time total factor productivity advanced by 3.5 
21
percent per year, the economy grew on average 5.5 
22
percent per year, income inequality fell by one-third, 
23
and Federal and State tax receipts rose dramati-
24
cally.
