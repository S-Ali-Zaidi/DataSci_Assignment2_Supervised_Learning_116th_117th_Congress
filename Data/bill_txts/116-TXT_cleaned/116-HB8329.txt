SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS.

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:

H8329
2 
•HR 8329 IH
(1) United States arms embargoed countries 
1
are implementing malign and aggressive industrial 
2
policies using non-market means and engaging in 
3
predatory investment to gain control of critical tech-
4
nologies in order to achieve market dominance and 
5
control supply chains. 
6
(2) These countries integrate their industrial 
7
policies into initiatives that break down the barriers 
8
and distinctions between the commercial sector and 
9
the military to ensure that critical technologies sup-
10
port the development of their military. 
11
(3) These countries seek to obtain critical tech-
12
nologies from the United States and covered United 
13
States allies and partners. 
14
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
15
gress that— 
16
(1) the fast-paced nature of technological inno-
17
vation and the systemic diversion of technological in-
18
novation and know-how by United States arms em-
19
bargoed countries for the benefit of developing and 
20
enhancing their militaries, challenges the effective-
21
ness of existing multilateral fora established specifi-
22
cally to prevent such export control risks, such as 
23
the Wassenaar Arrangement; and 
24
23:55 Oct 03, 2020
H8329

•HR 8329 IH
(2) the ability of United States arms embargoed 
1
countries to access critical technologies that affect 
2
the national security of the United States should 
3
spur the United States to work with covered United 
4
States allies and partners to develop unified export 
5
control policies to eliminate or substantially reduce 
6
the global availability of critical technologies to 
7
United States arms embargoed countries.

CRITICAL TECHNOLOGIES. 
10
(a) STATEMENT OF POLICY.—It is the policy of the 
11
United States to— 
12
(1) work with covered United States allies and 
13
partners to develop unified export control policies to 
14
eliminate or substantially reduce the global avail-
15
ability of critical technologies to United States arms 
16
embargoed countries, including by— 
17
(A) leading regular and rapid bilateral and 
18
plurilateral negotiations with respect to specific 
19
critical technologies with different groupings of 
20
such allies and partners; 
21
(B) using policy instruments, including 
22
tax, investment, licensing, lending, and trade, to 
23
provide incentives to such allies and partners;

and

(C) using, if necessary, existing authori-
1
ties, including trade remedies, the United 
2
States Munitions List, the Entity List, eco-
3
nomic sanctions, and other authorities available 
4
under the International Emergency Economic 
5
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.); 
6
(2) ensure critical technologies do not advance 
7
the economic strategies, industrial policy goals, or 
8
military capabilities of United States arms embar-
9
goed countries; 
10
(3) carry out joint research and development 
11
projects with covered United States allies and part-
12
ners, with adequate safeguards for the protection 
13
and promotion of any resulting intellectual property, 
14
to—

16
technical disciplines, including with respect to 
17
critical technologies that may be affected by the 
18
implementation of the strategy required by sub-
19
section (b); and 
20
(B) develop alternative markets to com-
21
pensate for lost sales opportunities; and
