SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The Russian Federation’s increased pres-
3
ence in the western hemisphere is of concern to the 
4
United States and our allies in the region. 
5
(2) In December 2018, the Russian Federation 
6
sent two Tu–160 nuclear-capable bombers to Ven-
7
ezuela for joint exercises with the Venezuelan mili-
8
tary. The Tu–160 can carry conventional or nuclear- 
9
tipped cruise missiles with an estimated maximum 
10
range of around 3,000 miles. 
11
(3) Russian and Venezuelan forces took part in 
12
a joint 10-hour exercise across the Caribbean in De-
13
cember 2018 with the Tu–160 nuclear-capable 
14
bombers. 
15
(4) The Maduro regime has turned to the Rus-
16
sian Federation, one of its strongest political allies, 
17
for financial support during its current economic cri-
18
sis. 
19
(5) Nicolas Maduro secured loans from the 
20
Russian Federation to be repaid through future oil 
21
exports, but fell behind on those payments in 2017. 
22
News reports in December 2018 suggest that Rus-
23
sian State oil company Rosneft has lent Venezuelan 
24
state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela (PdVSA) 
25
$6.5 billion partly as prepayment for crude oil, $3.1

•HR 1477 IH
billion of which remained outstanding as of the end 
1
of September 2018. 
2
(6) In 2016, PdVSA secured a $1.5 billion loan 
3
from Rosneft, and PdVSA used 49.9 percent of its 
4
shares in United States-based and Venezuelan- 
5
owned company CITGO as collateral. A Venezuelan 
6
default could lead to potential Russian ownership of 
7
United States energy infrastructure. 
8
(7) At the conclusion of a 3-day visit to Moscow 
9
in December 2018, Maduro announced $6 billion 
10
worth of Russian investment pledges focused on the 
11
oil and mining sectors as well as the export of 
12
600,000 tons of Russian wheat to Venezuela to 
13
cover its 2019 needs.
