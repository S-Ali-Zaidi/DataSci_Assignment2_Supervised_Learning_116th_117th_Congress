•HR 8939 IH
(1) Pain receptors (nociceptors) are present 
1
throughout the unborn child’s entire body and 
2
nerves link these receptors to the brain’s thalamus 
3
and subcortical plate by no later than 20 weeks after 
4
fertilization. 
5
(2) By 8 weeks after fertilization, the unborn 
6
child reacts to touch. After 20 weeks, the unborn 
7
child reacts to stimuli that would be recognized as 
8
painful if applied to an adult human, for example, 
9
by recoiling. 
10
(3) In the unborn child, application of such 
11
painful stimuli is associated with significant in-
12
creases in stress hormones known as the stress re-
13
sponse. 
14
(4) Subjection to such painful stimuli is associ-
15
ated with long-term harmful neurodevelopmental ef-
16
fects, such as altered pain sensitivity and, possibly, 
17
emotional, behavioral, and learning disabilities later 
18
in life. 
19
(5) For the purposes of surgery on unborn chil-
20
dren, fetal anesthesia is routinely administered and 
21
is associated with a decrease in stress hormones 
22
compared to their level when painful stimuli are ap-
23
plied without such anesthesia. In the United States, 
24
surgery of this type is being performed by 20 weeks

after fertilization and earlier in specialized units af-
1
filiated with children’s hospitals. 
2
(6) The position, asserted by some physicians, 
3
that the unborn child is incapable of experiencing 
4
pain until a point later in pregnancy than 20 weeks 
5
after fertilization predominately rests on the as-
6
sumption that the ability to experience pain depends 
7
on the cerebral cortex and requires nerve connec-
8
tions between the thalamus and the cortex. However, 
9
recent medical research and analysis, especially since 
10
2007, provides strong evidence for the conclusion 
11
that a functioning cortex is not necessary to experi-
12
ence pain. 
13
(7) Substantial evidence indicates that children 
14
born missing the bulk of the cerebral cortex, those 
15
with hydranencephaly, nevertheless experience pain. 
16
(8) In adult humans and in animals, stimula-
17
tion or ablation of the cerebral cortex does not alter 
18
pain perception, while stimulation or ablation of the 
19
thalamus does. 
20
(9) Substantial evidence indicates that struc-
21
tures used for pain processing in early development 
22
differ from those of adults, using different neural 
23
elements available at specific times during develop-

ment, such as the subcortical plate, to fulfill the role 
1
of pain processing. 
2
(10) The position, asserted by some commenta-
3
tors, that the unborn child remains in a coma-like 
4
sleep state that precludes the unborn child experi-
5
encing pain is inconsistent with the documented re-
6
action of unborn children to painful stimuli and with 
7
the experience of fetal surgeons who have found it 
8
necessary to sedate the unborn child with anesthesia 
9
to prevent the unborn child from engaging in vig-
10
orous movement in reaction to invasive surgery. 
11
(11) Consequently, there is substantial medical 
12
evidence that an unborn child is capable of experi-
13
encing pain at least by 20 weeks after fertilization, 
14
if not earlier. 
15
(12) It is the purpose of the Congress to assert 
16
a compelling governmental interest in protecting the 
17
lives of unborn children from the stage at which sub-
18
stantial medical evidence indicates that they are ca-
19
pable of feeling pain. 
20
(13) The compelling governmental interest in 
21
protecting the lives of unborn children from the 
22
stage at which substantial medical evidence indicates 
23
that they are capable of feeling pain is intended to 
24
be separate from and independent of the compelling

governmental interest in protecting the lives of un-

born children from the stage of viability, and neither

governmental interest is intended to replace the

(14) Congress has authority to extend protec-
5
tion to pain-capable unborn children under the Su-
6
preme Court’s Commerce Clause precedents and

under the Constitution’s grants of powers to Con-
8
gress under the Equal Protection, Due Process, and
