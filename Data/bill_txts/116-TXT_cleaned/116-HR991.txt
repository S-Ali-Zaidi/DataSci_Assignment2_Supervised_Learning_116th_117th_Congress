RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for designation of March 1 as ‘‘National 
Healthcare Professional Appreciation Day’’ in commemo-
ration of the day the first American healthcare profes-
sional became infected with COVID-19 while caring for 
a patient. 
Whereas healthcare professionals have put saving and caring 
for others above their own personal health and safety; 
Whereas healthcare professionals have gone above and beyond 
their call of duty to help stem the spread of Coronavirus 
Disease 2019 (in this resolution referred to as ‘‘COVID- 
19’’) through treating and testing millions of Americans 
and by performing vaccine research;

•HRES 991 IH 
Whereas healthcare professionals have saved thousands of 
lives during the COVID-19 pandemic with their selfless 
care; 
Whereas through these unprecedented times healthcare pro-
fessionals have continued to treat and comfort those most 
affected by COVID-19 even when those professionals 
have not had access to adequate personal protective 
equipment; 
Whereas over 10,000 healthcare professionals have tested 
positive for COVID-19; 
Whereas brave healthcare professionals have left their fami-
lies daily to tend to those in need, and some have not 
seen their loved ones for extended periods of time; 
Whereas many healthcare professionals have been working 
around the clock, seven days a week; 
Whereas hundreds of healthcare professionals have lost their 
lives to COVID-19; and 
Whereas February 29, 2020, a leap day, was the date on 
which the first healthcare professional was infected with 
COVID-19: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the designation of ‘‘National 
2
Healthcare Professional Appreciation Day’’; and 
3
(2) acknowledges the heroism and sacrifice of 
4
healthcare professionals in addressing the COVID- 
5
19 pandemic.
