To provide women with increased access to preventive and 
life-saving cancer screening. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 2. PURPOSE. 
1
It is the purpose of this Act to provide women with 
2
increased access to preventive and life-saving cancer 
3
screening, including clinical breast exams and cervical, 
4
ovarian, uterine, vaginal, and vulvar cancer screening, pro-
5
vided by leading women’s health care providers who— 
6
(1) serve populations most at risk; and 
7
(2) play an outsized role in the prevention and 
8
detection of cancer in order to serve the goal of re-
9
ducing health care disparities among low-income 
10
women and women of color, decrease health care 
11
spending, and expand health literacy, access, and 
12
education about the benefits of regular preventive 
13
cancer screening for women. 
14
SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
15
Congress finds as follows: 
16
(1) Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer 
17
death in women under the age of 54, and the Amer-
18
ican Cancer Society recommends that women in 
19
their 20s and 30s have a clinical breast exam at 
20
least every 3 years. 
21
(2) Ovarian cancer causes more deaths than 
22
any other cancer of the female reproductive system, 
23
but it accounts for only about 3 percent of all can-
24
cers in women. 
25

•HR 3129 IH
(3) The cancers that most frequently impact 
1
women include breast, uterine, ovarian, and cervical 
2
cancer, and there were 331,394 new cases of these 
3
cancers in 2015. 
4
(4) Rates of incidence and death for gynecologic 
5
cancers by race and ethnicity show that, while for 
6
some cancers, like ovarian cancer, the rates of inci-
7
dence and death are similar among all races, for 
8
other cancers, like cervical cancer, women of color 
9
have a disproportionate rate of incidence. While the 
10
incidence of uterine cancer is similar for White 
11
women and women of color, rates of death for uter-
12
ine cancer are 2 times higher for Black women than 
13
for White women. 
14
(5) Prevention and cancer screening are the 
15
best approaches to protecting women from cancer 
16
and ensuring early detection and life-saving treat-
17
ment. Many deaths from breast and cervical cancers 
18
could be avoided if cancer screening rates and diag-
19
nostic care and services increased among women at 
20
risk. Deaths from these cancers occur disproportion-
21
ately among women who are uninsured or under-
22
insured. 
23
(6) Due to enhanced screening, cervical cancer, 
24
which used to be the leading cause of cancer death 
25
19:50 Jun 12, 2019
H3129

•HR 3129 IH
for women in the United States, is now a much more 
1
preventable and treatable cancer. It is also highly 
2
curable when found and treated early. 
3
(7) Increased access to education, information, 
4
and preventive cancer screening increase women’s 
5
ability to survive cancer. 
6
(8) While more than 15 percent of cases of cer-
7
vical cancer are found in women over the age of 65, 
8
it becomes less likely that women are tested for cer-
9
vical cancer ever or within the previous 5 years as 
10
their age increases. 
11
(9) Women’s health care providers that are pri-
12
marily engaged in family planning services, such as 
13
Planned Parenthood health centers, provide nec-
14
essary screening tests, education, and information to 
15
women, especially women of color who face the high-
16
est risks of breast cancer and other gynecologic can-
17
cers.
