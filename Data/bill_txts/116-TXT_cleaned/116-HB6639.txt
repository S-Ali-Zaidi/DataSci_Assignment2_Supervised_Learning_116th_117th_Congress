congressional approval under the United States Con-
1
stitution and United States law. 
2
(2) The Constitution, in article I, section 8, 
3
grants Congress the sole power to declare war. 
4
(3) George Washington, in a letter to William 
5
Moultrie dated August 28, 1793, wrote, ‘‘The con-
6
stitution vests the power of declaring war in Con-
7
gress; therefore no offensive expedition of impor-
8
tance can be undertaken until after they shall have 
9
deliberated upon the subject and authorized such a 
10
measure.’’. 
11
(4) In Examination Number 1 of the Hamilton 
12
Papers, dated December 17, 1801, Alexander Ham-
13
ilton wrote, ‘‘The Congress shall have the power to 
14
declare war; the plain meaning of which is, that it 
15
is the peculiar and exclusive duty of Congress, when 
16
the nation is at peace, to change that state into a 
17
state of war.’’. 
18
(5) James Madison wrote, in Madison Papers, 
19
Helvidius, Number 4, dated September 14, 1793, 
20
‘‘The power to declare war, including the power of 
21
judging the causes of war, is fully and exclusively 
22
vested in the legislature . . . the executive has no 
23
right, in any case, to decide the question, whether 
24
there is or is not cause for declaring war.’’.

(6) Section 2(c) of the War Powers Resolution

2
powers of the President as Commander-in-Chief to 
3
introduce United States Armed Forces into hos-
4
tilities, or into situations where imminent involve-
5
ment in hostilities is clearly indicated by the cir-
6
cumstances, are exercised only pursuant to (1) a 
7
declaration of war, (2) specific statutory authoriza-
8
tion, or (3) a national emergency created by attack 
9
upon the United States, its territories or posses-
10
sions, or its armed forces’’. 
11
(7) On April 12, 2018, then-Director of the 
12
Central Intelligence Agency, Mike Pompeo, testified 
13
before the Committee on Foreign Relations of the 
14
Senate that he believed the President had the au-
15
thority to send U.S. military forces into action even 
16
if none of the qualifications of section 2(c) of the 
17
War Powers Resolution are met.

19
ity in the Senate directed the President to remove

22
explicitly authorized by Congress, following passage 
23
of a similar measure in the House of Representa-
24
tives on January 9, 2020.

5

SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS IN SUPPORT OF DIPLOMATIC 
12
RESOLUTION TO GROWING TENSIONS WITH 
13
NORTH KOREA. 
14
It is the sense of Congress that— 
15
(1) a conflict on the Korean peninsula would 
16
have catastrophic consequences for the American 
17
people, for members of the United States Armed 
18
Forces stationed in the region, for United States in-
19
terests, for United States allies the Republic of 
20
Korea and Japan, for the long-suffering people of 
21
North Korea, and for global peace and security more 
22
broadly, and that actions and statements that in-
23
crease tensions and could lead to miscalculation 
24
should be avoided; and

2
sible opportunity to engage in talks with the Govern-
3
ment of North Korea on concrete steps to reduce

tensions and improve communication, and to reinvig-
5
orate high-level negotiations aimed at achieving a

diplomatic agreement consistent with the June 12,
