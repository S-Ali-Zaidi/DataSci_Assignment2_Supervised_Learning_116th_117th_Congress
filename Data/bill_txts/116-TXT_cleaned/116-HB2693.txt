A BILL 
To amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to improve 
access to, and utilization of, bone mass measurement 
benefits under part B of the Medicare program by estab-
lishing a minimum payment amount under such part 
for bone mass measurement. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. FINDINGS. 
1
The Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Osteoporosis is a major public health prob-
3
lem with 54 million Americans as of 2010 having ei-
4
ther low bone mass or osteoporosis, responsible for 
5
over 2 million fractures per year, including over 
6
300,000 hip fractures. The estimated total cost of 
7
these fractures is expected to rise to over $25 billion 
8
by 2025. 
9
(2) Osteoporosis is a silent disease that often is 
10
not discovered until a fracture occurs. One out of 
11
two women and up to one of four men will suffer an 
12
osteoporotic fracture in their lifetimes. 
13
(3) Osteoporosis disproportionately impacts 
14
women, who account for 71 percent of osteoporotic 
15
fractures, and 75 percent of costs. 
16
(4) Most women are not aware of their personal 
17
risk factors for osteoporosis, the prevalence of, or 
18
the morbidity and mortality associated with the dis-
19
ease, despite the fact that broken bones due to 
20
osteoporosis lead to more hospitalizations and great-
21
er health care costs than heart attack, stroke, or 
22
breast cancer in women age 55 and above. 
23
(5) A woman’s risk of hip fracture is equal to 
24
her combined risk of breast, uterine, and ovarian 
25
cancer. More women die in the United States in the 
26

year following a hip fracture than from breast can-
1
cer. 
2
(6) One out of four people who have an 
3
osteoporotic hip fracture will need long-term nursing 
4
home care. Half of those who experience osteoporotic 
5
hip fractures are unable to walk without assistance. 
6
(7) Approximately 25 percent of women over 
7
the age of 50 who sustain a hip fracture die in the 
8
year following the fracture, while a further 20 per-
9
cent will never leave a nursing facility. 
10
(8) Bone density testing is more powerful in 
11
predicting fractures than cholesterol is in predicting 
12
myocardial infarction or blood pressure in predicting 
13
stroke. 
14
(9) Osteoporosis remains both under-recognized 
15
and under-treated. Over a 7-year period (2007– 
16
2013), 45 percent of older female Medicare bene-
17
ficiaries had no DXA bone density test, and 25 per-
18
cent had only one test. 
19
(10) Since 2007, Medicare has cut DXA reim-
20
bursement by over 70 percent. By 2016, the pay-
21
ment cuts caused a loss of 36 percent of DXA pro-
22
viders, resulting in a 21 percent decline in 
23
osteoporosis diagnosis and treatment.

(11) A decade of steady decline in hip fractures 
1
stopped abruptly in 2013. Since then, there have 
2
been more than 24,000 additional hip fractures, 
3
costing over $1 billion, leading to 4,800 more deaths 
4
than expected if the decline had continued.

Section 1848(b) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.
