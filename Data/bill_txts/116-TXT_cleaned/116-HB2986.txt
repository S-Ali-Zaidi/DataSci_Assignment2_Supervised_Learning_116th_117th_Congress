‘‘(A) ENERGY
STORAGE
SYSTEM.—The 
15
term ‘energy storage system’ means a system, 
16
equipment, facility, or technology that—

19
and dispatching the stored energy; and 
20
‘‘(ii)(I) uses a mechanical, electrical, 
21
chemical, electrochemical, or thermal proc-
22
ess to store energy that— 
23
‘‘(aa) was generated at an earlier 
24
time for use at a later time; or

1
chanical process, and would otherwise

‘‘(II) stores thermal energy for direct 
5
use for heating or cooling at a later time 
6

8
manner as the storage and use offered by 
9
a grid-enabled water heater.
