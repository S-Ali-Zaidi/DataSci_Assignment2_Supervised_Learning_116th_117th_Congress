Whereas Federal agencies have made some efforts to imple-
ment the goals and directives of Executive Order 13443, 
and the agencies should still work to complete the direc-
tives completely and purposefully; 
Whereas public lands throughout the country promote rec-
reational opportunities for American families, economic 
revenue, public health and education, and environmental 
protection and conservation; and 
Whereas the primary objective with any and all Federal land 
management should be to provide for their protection and 
conservation while also maintaining access for those 
whom these lands belong, the American public: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House supports efforts— 
1
(1) to reaffirm to Federal agencies the prior-

ities and goals of Executive Order 13443, completely
