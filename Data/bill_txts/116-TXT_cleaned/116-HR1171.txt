RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the instrumental role United States global food 
security programs, particularly the Feed the Future pro-
gram, have played in reducing global poverty, building 
resilience and tackling hunger and malnutrition around 
the world, and calling for continued investment in global 
food security in the face of the economic impact of 
COVID–19. 
Whereas food security and nutrition are fundamental to 
human development, particularly in the critical 1,000 day 
window until a child’s second birthday, and persistent 
hunger and malnutrition stunt children’s mental and 
physical development and hinder the health, prosperity, 
and security of societies;

•HRES 1171 IH 
Whereas food insecurity and malnutrition in low- and middle- 
income countries force tens of millions of people into pov-
erty, contribute to political and social instability, and 
erode economic growth; 
Whereas in its 2014 Worldwide Threat Assessment of the 
United States, the United States intelligence community 
reported that the ‘‘lack of adequate food will be a desta-
bilizing factor in countries important to United States 
national security’’ and has since consistently linked global 
food insecurity to broader instability; 
Whereas, despite decades of progress, the State of Food Se-
curity and Nutrition in the World report for 2020 indi-
cates that global hunger has increased since 2014, with 
2,000,000,000 people worldwide currently experiencing 
food insecurity, of which nearly 750,000,000 people are 
facing severe food insecurity, and 10,000,000 more peo-
ple having fallen into hunger between 2018 and 2019, 
144,000,000 children stunted, and 47,000,0000 children 
experiencing wasting; 
Whereas the COVID–19 pandemic has exposed vulnerabilities 
in global food systems and food supply chains, and has 
severely exacerbated existing food security shocks, such 
as the Fall Army Worm and desert locust infestations in 
the Horn of Africa region, particularly in Kenya, Ethi-
opia, and Somalia, as well as parts of Asia and the Mid-
dle East, which already represented an unprecedented 
threat to global food security and livelihoods; 
Whereas the COVID–19 pandemic and its second-order im-
pacts are expected to dramatically worsen the state of 
global food security and nutrition, with preliminary as-
sessments predicting a doubling of severe hunger (from 
135,000,000 to 265,000,000 people) and an increase in

child wasting (from 47,000,000 to 52,000,000) by the 
end of 2020; 
Whereas the United States has been a global leader in ad-
dressing food insecurity on a bipartisan basis and across 
Administrations, particularly in response to the global 
food price crisis in 2007–2008 and subsequent launch of 
the whole-of-government, United States Agency for Inter-
national Development-led, Feed the Future program in 
2010; 
Whereas the late Senator Richard Lugar of Indiana was in-
strumental in advancing United States efforts to reduce 
global poverty through smart investments in agriculture 
and food security, including through his stewardship of 
the Global Food Security Acts of 2008 and 2009, support 
for the launch of the Feed the Future program in 2010, 
and continued advocacy to formally authorize the Feed 
the Future program through enactment of the Global 
Food Security Act of 2016 (Public Law 114–195) and 
the Global Food Security Reauthorization Act of 2018 
(Public Law 115–266); 
Whereas the Global Food Security Act of 2016 (Public Law 
114–195), as enacted in 2016 and reauthorized in 2018, 
required the development and implementation of a com-
prehensive United States Government Global Food Secu-
rity Strategy and codified the Feed the Future frame-
work, strengthening its accountability and transparency 
mechanisms, deepening interagency engagement, and en-
gaging a broad coalition of stakeholders, including faith- 
based and civil society organizations, universities and re-
search institutions, the United States private sector, and 
United States farm and commodity organizations;

Whereas Feed the Future investments have helped transform 
countries’ food systems and improve their own food secu-
rity and nutrition, with investments currently focused in 
twelve target countries and 35 aligned countries and re-
gions in Asia, Central America, and east, southern, and 
west Africa; 
Whereas according to its most recent progress report, Feed 
the Future has helped more than 23,400,000 people lift 
themselves out of poverty, prevented 3,400,000 children 
from being stunted, and ensured that 5,200,000 families 
no longer suffer from hunger in areas where the program 
operates; 
Whereas Feed the Future is making significant progress to-
wards building local capacity and resilience by promoting 
inclusive economic growth, strengthening monitoring and 
evaluation, implementing sustainable agricultural prac-
tices, risk management, improving forecasting and adap-
tation, and building the agricultural capacity of rural 
communities; 
Whereas Feed the Future also is advancing women’s eco-
nomic empowerment by providing targeted technical as-
sistance to women working in agricultural systems and 
equipping women with adequate tools, training, and tech-
nology for small-scale agriculture; 
Whereas Feed the Future investments benefit communities in 
the United States as well, including by increasing United 
States trade and agricultural exports to Feed the Future 
countries by more than $1,400,000,000 since inception; 
and 
Whereas Feed the Future investments in international agri-
cultural research and development through partnerships

with United States universities and land-grant institu-
tions, international research systems, such as the Consor-
tium of International Agricultural Research Centers, and 
other organizations will help the United States agricul-
tural sector prepare for, adapt to, and remain resilient 
amid evolving threats; Now, therefore, be it
