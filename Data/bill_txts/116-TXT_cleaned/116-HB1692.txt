A BILL 
To ensure affordable abortion coverage and care for every 
woman, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Equal Access to Abor-
4
tion Coverage in Health Insurance (EACH Woman) Act 
5
of 2019’’. 
6
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
7
Congress makes the following findings: 
8
(1) Affordable, comprehensive health insurance 
9
that includes coverage for a full range of pregnancy- 
10
related care, including abortion, is critical to the 
11
health of every person regardless of actual or per-
12
ceived race, color, national origin, immigration sta-
13
tus, sex (including sexual orientation, gender iden-
14
tity, pregnancy, childbirth, a medical condition relat-
15
ing to pregnancy or childbirth, or sex stereotyping), 
16
age, or disability status. 
17
(2) Neither a woman’s income level nor her 
18
type of insurance should prevent her from having ac-
19
cess to a full range of pregnancy-related care, in-
20
cluding abortion services.

(3) No woman should have the decision to have, 
1
or not to have, an abortion made for her based on 
2
her ability or inability to afford the procedure. 
3
(4) Since 1976, the Federal Government has 
4
withheld funds for abortion coverage in most cir-
5
cumstances, affecting women of reproductive age in 
6
the United States who are insured through the Med-
7
icaid program, as well as women who receive insur-
8
ance or care through other federal health plans and 
9
programs. Of women aged 15–44 enrolled in Med-
10
icaid in 2017, 55 percent lived in the 35 States and 
11
the District of Columbia that do not cover abortion, 
12
except in limited circumstances. This amounts to 
13
roughly 7.3 million women of reproductive age, in-
14
cluding 3.1 million women living below the Federal 
15
poverty level. Women of color are disproportionately 
16
likely to be insured by the Medicaid program: Na-
17
tionwide, 32 percent of Black women and 27 percent 
18
of Hispanic women aged 15–44 were enrolled in 
19
Medicaid in 2017, compared with 16 percent of 
20
White women. 
21
(5) Moreover, 26 States also prohibit abortion 
22
coverage in private insurance plans within or beyond 
23
health insurance marketplaces under the Patient 
24
Protection and Affordable Care Act.

(6) Restrictions on abortion coverage interfere 
1
with a woman’s personal decision making, with her 
2
health and well-being, and with her constitutionally 
3
protected right to a safe and legal medical proce-
4
dure. 
5
(7) Restrictions on abortion coverage have a 
6
disproportionate impact on low-income women, 
7
women of color, immigrant women, and young 
8
women. These women are already disadvantaged in 
9
their access to the resources, information, and serv-
10
ices necessary to prevent an unintended pregnancy 
11
or to carry a healthy pregnancy to term.

17
(1) the Federal Government, acting in its ca-
18
pacity as an insurer, employer, or health care pro-

vider, should serve as a model for the Nation to en-
20
sure coverage of abortion care; and 
21
(2) moreover, restrictions on coverage of abor-
22
tion care in the private insurance market must end.
