SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress makes the following findings: 
2
(1) Recent natural and man-made disasters 
3
have highlighted the need for planning to minimize 
4
the impact of disasters. 
5
(2) Lack of preparedness in times of disaster 
6
can have especially devastating effects on animals 
7
and the people who risk their lives to protect them. 
8
(3) Local first-responders, nongovernmental 
9
agencies, and private individuals most often shoulder 
10
the cost and responsibility of animals affected by 
11
disasters. 
12
(4) It is reasonable to ask those who use ani-
13
mals commercially to demonstrate a level of readi-
14
ness to protect the animals under their care.
