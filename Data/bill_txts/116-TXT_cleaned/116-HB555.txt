SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Disability Integration 
2
Act of 2019’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. 
4
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) In enacting the Americans with Disabilities 
6
Act of 1990 (referred to in this Act as the ‘‘ADA’’), 
7
Congress— 
8
(A) recognized that ‘‘historically, society 
9
has tended to isolate and segregate individuals 
10
with disabilities, and, despite some improve-
11
ments, such forms of discrimination against in-
12
dividuals with disabilities continue to be a seri-
13
ous and pervasive social problem’’; and 
14
(B) intended that the ADA assure ‘‘full 
15
participation’’ and ‘‘independent living’’ for in-
16
dividuals with disabilities by addressing ‘‘dis-
17
crimination against individuals with disabilities 
18
[that] persists in critical areas’’, including insti-
19
tutionalization. 
20
(2) While Congress expected that the ADA’s in-
21
tegration mandate would be interpreted in a manner 
22
that ensures that individuals who are eligible for in-
23
stitutional placement are able to exercise a right to 
24
community-based long-term services and supports, 
25
that expectation has not been fulfilled. 
26

•HR 555 IH
(3) The holdings of the Supreme Court in 
1
Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), and com-
2
panion cases, have clearly articulated that individ-
3
uals with disabilities have a civil right under the 
4
ADA to participate in society as equal citizens. How-
5
ever, many States still do not provide sufficient com-
6
munity-based long-term services and supports to in-
7
dividuals with disabilities to end segregation in insti-
8
tutions. 
9
(4) The right to live in the community is nec-
10
essary for the exercise of the civil rights that the 
11
ADA was intended to secure for all individuals with 
12
disabilities. The lack of adequate community-based 
13
services and supports has imperiled the civil rights 
14
of all individuals with disabilities, and has under-
15
mined the very promise of the ADA. It is, therefore, 
16
necessary to recognize in statute a robust and fully 
17
articulated right to community living. 
18
(5) States, with a few exceptions, continue to 
19
approach decisions regarding long-term services and 
20
supports from social welfare and budgetary perspec-
21
tives, but for the promise of the ADA to be fully re-
22
alized, States must approach these decisions from a 
23
civil rights perspective. 
24
21:01 Feb 04, 2019
H555

•HR 555 IH
(6) States have not consistently planned to en-
1
sure sufficient services and supports for individuals 
2
with disabilities, including those with the most sig-
3
nificant disabilities, to enable individuals with dis-
4
abilities to live in the most integrated setting. As a 
5
result, many individuals with disabilities who reside 
6
in institutions are prevented from residing in the 
7
community and individuals with disabilities who are 
8
not in institutions find themselves at risk of institu-
9
tional placement. 
10
(7) The continuing existence of unfair and un-
11
necessary institutionalization denies individuals with 
12
disabilities the opportunity to live and participate on 
13
an equal basis in the community and costs the 
14
United States billions of dollars in unnecessary 
15
spending related to perpetuating dependency and 
16
unnecessary confinement. 
17
(b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this Act are— 
18
(1) to clarify and strengthen the ADA’s inte-
19
gration mandate in a manner that accelerates State 
20
compliance; 
21
(2) to clarify that every individual who is eligi-
22
ble for long-term services and supports has a feder-
23
ally protected right to be meaningfully integrated 
24

into that individual’s community and receive commu-
1
nity-based long-term services and supports; 
2
(3) to ensure that States provide long-term 
3
services and supports to individuals with disabilities 
4
in a manner that allows individuals with disabilities 
5
to live in the most integrated setting, including the 
6
individual’s own home, have maximum control over 
7
their services and supports, and ensure that long- 
8
term services and supports are provided in a manner 
9
that allows individuals with disabilities to lead an 
10
independent life; 
11
(4) to establish a comprehensive State planning 
12
requirement that includes enforceable, measurable 
13
objectives that are designed to transition individuals 
14
with all types of disabilities at all ages out of institu-
15
tions and into the most integrated setting; and 
16
(5) to establish a requirement for clear and uni-
17
form annual public reporting by States that includes 
18
reporting about— 
19
(A) the number of individuals with disabil-
20
ities who are served in the community and the 
21
number who are served in institutions; and 
22
(B) the number of individuals with disabil-
23
ities who have transitioned from an institution 
24
to a community-based living situation, and the
