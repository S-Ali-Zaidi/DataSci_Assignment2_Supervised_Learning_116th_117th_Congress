This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Commission on the

Social Status of Black Men and Boys Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress makes the following findings:

•HR 1636 IH
(1) Black men and boys face disproportionate 
1
hardships that result in disparities in areas includ-
2
ing: education, criminal justice, health, employment, 
3
fatherhood, mentorship, and violence. These hard-
4
ships have negative consequences for national pro-
5
ductivity, especially for Black families and commu-
6
nities. 
7
(2) A Commission to study and examine issues 
8
which disproportionately have a negative impact on 
9
Black men and boys in America will signal that the 
10
issues facing the Black male population are a na-
11
tional priority, will develop solutions to these hard-
12
ships, and will help eliminate the obstacles facing 
13
Black men and boys. 
14
(3) A Commission will also be able to inves-
15
tigate potential civil rights violations affecting this 
16
population that attract national attention. 
17
(4) Black babies are three times more likely to 
18
be born in poverty and rapidly fall behind their 
19
White counterparts in cognitive development. 
20
(5) By fourth grade, Black students are ex-
21
pected to be three years behind White male students. 
22
According to the Educational Testing Service Policy 
23
Informational Center, only 12 percent of Black 
24
eighth-grade male students are proficient in math, 
25

•HR 1636 IH
compared to 44 percent of White eighth-grade male 
1
students. 
2
(6) The Educational Testing Service Policy In-
3
formational Center also found that nationally, more 
4
than 50 percent of Black male students attending 
5
urban schools will drop out. 
6
(7) The low rate of high school retention among 
7
Black male students directly relates to high rates of 
8
joblessness and incarceration among this population. 
9
This barrier to employment exacerbates cycles of 
10
poverty, which in turn results in health inequalities, 
11
including higher levels of diabetes, obesity, and HIV/ 
12
AIDS. According to a study by the American Acad-
13
emy of Arts and Sciences, more than 66 percent of 
14
Black male dropouts are expected to serve time in 
15
State or Federal prison. 
16
(8) Black men are subjected to unequal 
17
profiling by the police and disproportionately harsh 
18
sentences in the judicial system. The Black male 
19
population is six times more likely to become incar-
20
cerated than their White counterparts. Although the 
21
Black male population comprises approximately six 
22
percent of the United States population, of the 
23
2,300,000 people incarcerated nationwide, 1 million 
24
are Black males. Black males receive ten percent 
25

•HR 1636 IH
longer Federal sentences than White males who 
1
commit the same crime. 
2
(9) According to the Bureau of Statistics and 
3
the Pew Research Center, Black male unemployment 
4
is consistently almost double that of White male un-
5
employment. 
6
(10) Black fathers are more than twice as likely 
7
to live apart from their children as White fathers. 
8
(11) Young boys with male mentors are more 
9
likely to progress further in school and have greater 
10
financial success in life.
