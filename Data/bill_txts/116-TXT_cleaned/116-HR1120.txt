RESOLUTION 
Urging the Government of Tanzania and all parties to re-
spect human rights and constitutional rights and ensure 
free and fair elections in October 2020, and recognizing 
the importance of multi-party democracy in Tanzania. 
Whereas the United States has an important interest in sup-
porting democracy in Tanzania and has consistently dem-
onstrated support for the Tanzanian people through ef-
forts to advance good governance, economic growth, and 
improved access to health and education resources; 
Whereas Tanzania has held successive multiparty elections 
since 1995, with the elections in 2015 being the most 
competitive to date, despite facing substantial State in-
terference in political organizing, both during and fol-
lowing the campaign period;

Whereas since President John Magufuli’s election in 2015, 
the Government of Tanzania has adopted and enforced 
multiple repressive laws that restrict freedom of the 
press, and of expression, assembly, and association, in-
cluding the Cybercrimes Act of 2015, the Media Services 
Act of 2016, the Electronic and Postal Communications 
(Online Content) Regulations Act of 2018, the Written 
Laws (Miscellaneous Amendments) (No. 3) Act, 2018, 
and the Written Laws (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act 
No. 3 of 2020; 
Whereas the Government of Tanzania has actively under-
mined independent collection, dissemination, and publica-
tion of statistics without government approval, and sus-
pended or halted activities by multiple newspapers and 
digital and broadcast media outlets for publishing content 
deemed critical of the State or officials; 
Whereas State or State-sponsored actors have threatened, ar-
bitrarily arrested, and attacked journalists with impunity, 
some of whom have disappeared; 
Whereas in mid-2016, the Magufuli Government placed a ban 
on political party rallies until the 2020 elections, political 
freedoms were further eroded following the amendment of 
the Political Parties Act in January 2019, and private 
opposition political party meetings have been broken up 
by police; 
Whereas freedom of association has been limited through ar-
bitrary and mandatory registration and reporting proc-
esses for nongovernmental organizations; 
Whereas, in September 2019, the Government of Tanzania 
amended both the Companies Act and Nongovernmental 
Organization Act, which have severely restricted the abil-

ity of civil society organizations working on democracy 
and human rights to receive foreign funds; 
Whereas opposition leaders have been threatened, intimi-
dated, and physically attacked, and the government has 
failed to hold perpetrators accountable; 
Whereas President Magufuli’s lack of action to hold Tanza-
nian authorities accountable for arbitrary arrests, paired 
with actions to limit democratic space for civil society, 
the opposition party, and citizens of Tanzania has under-
mined the Constitution and rule of law in the country; 
Whereas the United States companies operating in Tanzania 
have reported harassment, corruption, and lack of respect 
for contracts and business operations, which threatens 
future United States business investment and trade part-
nerships; and 
Whereas the Government of Tanzania’s denial of the exist-
ence of COVID–19 in the country and suppression of in-
formation related to the pandemic has not only placed 
citizens’ health at risk, but has also violated citizens’ 
freedom of speech and right of access to information: 
Now, therefore be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) urges the Government of Tanzania to en-
2
sure that the 2020 election is carried out in a free,
