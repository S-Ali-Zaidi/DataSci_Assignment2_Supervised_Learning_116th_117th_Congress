A BILL 
To authorize assistance to aid in the prevention and treat-
ment of obstetric fistula in foreign countries, and for 
other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Obstetric Fistula Pre-
4
vention, Treatment, Hope, and Dignity Restoration Act 
5
of 2020’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
7
Congress finds the following: 
8
(1) Every two minutes, one woman dies from 
9
pregnancy-related complications. This means ap-

proximately 830 women die from pregnancy- or 
1
childbirth-related complications around the world 
2
every day. Of these deaths, 99 percent occur in de-
3
veloping countries. Over half of these deaths are in 
4
sub-Saharan Africa and one-third are in South Asia. 
5
(2) Obstetric fistula is one of the most severe 
6
and tragic pregnancy-related injuries, which occurs 
7
when a woman experiences prolonged, obstructed 
8
labor in the absence of trained medical assistance, 
9
which is most commonly a Caesarean section, nec-
10
essary for a safe delivery. 
11
(3) Obstetric fistula is a hole that is formed be-
12
tween the bladder and the vagina, or the rectum and 
13
the vagina (or both). In the struggle to pass through 
14
the birth canal, the fetus puts constant pressure, 
15
sometimes for several days, on the bladder and vag-
16
inal or rectal walls, destroying the tissue that then 
17
dies and sloughs off, resulting in the abnormal open-
18
ing or hole. 
19
(4) In approximately 90 percent of obstetric fis-
20
tula cases, the baby will be stillborn. A mother will 
21
experience physical pain and multiple physical dis-
22
abilities, as well as social and emotional trauma 
23
from living with incontinence and from the loss of 
24
her child.

(5) In addition to constant uncontrollable leak-
1
ing of urine, feces, or both, the physical conse-
2
quences of obstetric fistula may include frequent 
3
bladder infections, painful sores, kidney failure, in-
4
fertility, foul odor, orthopedic injury, nerve damage 
5
that makes normal walking impossible and internal 
6
genital scarring that destroys normal sexual func-
7
tion. 
8
(6) Women and girls with obstetric fistula are 
9
commonly ostracized by their families and commu-
10
nities, leading to depression, anxiety, post-traumatic 
11
stress disorder, social isolation and discrimination, 
12
suicidal thoughts or actions, and lack of adequate 
13
economic opportunities, resulting in deepening pov-
14
erty, isolation, and vulnerability. 
15
(7) Although data on obstetric fistula are 
16
scarce, the World Health Organization (WHO) esti-
17
mates there are more than 2,000,000 women and 
18
girls living with fistula, and 50,000 to 100,000 new 
19
cases each year. 
20
(8) Obstetric fistula was once common through-
21
out the world, but over the last century has been vir-
22
tually eliminated in Europe, North America, and 
23
other developed regions through improved access to 
24
high-quality, timely medical interventions, particu-
25

•HR 8971 IH
larly emergency obstetric care including Caesarean 
1
section. 
2
(9) Obstetric fistula is preventable through 
3
timely medical interventions and providing access to 
4
family planning for all women who need it. Social 
5
interventions such as alleviating poverty, delaying 
6
early marriage and early childbearing, educating and 
7
empowering young women, remedying gender and 
8
socioeconomic inequalities, and addressing malnutri-
9
tion can also help prevent this complication. 
10
(10) The majority of obstetric fistula can be 
11
surgically treated. When performed by a skilled, 
12
competent surgeon, the procedure is relatively inex-
13
pensive with high rates of success. 
14
(11) In 2003, the United Nations Population 
15
Fund (UNFPA), EngenderHealth, and other part-
16
ners launched a global Campaign to End Fistula 
17
(the Campaign) to identify and address obstetric fis-
18
tula in an effort to develop a means to treat and 
19
support those women who are suffering and provide 
20
the necessary health services to prevent further 
21
cases. Operating in more than 50 countries across 
22
Africa, Asia, and the Arab region, the Campaign has 
23
four main goals: the prevention of fistula cases, 
24
treatment of existing fistula cases, social reintegra-

tion and follow up for fistula survivors, and advocacy 
1
for ending fistula. 
2
(12) In order to meet these goals, The Cam-
3
paign supports and participates in the emerging 
4
‘‘safe surgery’’ community of practice that strength-
5
ens surgical ecosystems in low- and middle-income 
6
countries (LMIC) towards better access to essential 
7
and life-saving surgeries, which includes improved 
8
training, equipment, supplies, infrastructure and 
9
health worker density for timely access to Caesarean 
10
section and for environments that optimize outcomes 
11
of fistula surgery. 
12
(13) Since 2003, UNFPA has directly sup-
13
ported more than 85,000 fistula repairs, with addi-
14
tional repairs supported by Campaign partners. 
15
(14) USAID, in accordance with the United 
16
States Government’s commitment to ending prevent-
17
able maternal and newborn deaths and disabilities, 
18
currently supports fistula treatment services in 137 
19
sites in six countries. USAID addresses prevention 
20
in those sites and thirty-six more. Since 2004, more 
21
than 39,000 women have received fistula repairs 
22
with USAID support. 
23
(15) The United States has committed to join-
24
ing multilateral efforts involving the United Nations

and others to make progress toward achieving the 
1
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including 
2
through the Global Strategy for Women’s, Children’s 
3
and Adolescents’ Health (2016–2030). Eliminating 
4
obstetric fistula is key to achieving the SDGs’ vision 
5
of ‘‘leaving no one behind.’’. 
6
(16) In his 2016 statement on the International 
7
Day to End Obstetric Fistula, United Nations Sec-
8
retary General Ban Ki-Moon boldly laid forth a new 
9
global vision and goal of ending obstetric fistula 
10
within a generation, saying that, ‘‘The persistence of 
11
fistula in some countries and regions is an indicator 
12
of very poor access to quality maternal health serv-
13
ices. To end it, we must strengthen health systems 
14
and address broader development and human rights 
15
issues affecting women and girls: poverty, gender in-
16
equality, early marriage, early childbearing, and lack 
17
of education. Let us use the momentum of the Sus-
18
tainable Development Goals together with strong po-
19
litical leadership, accelerated investment and action, 
20
and passionate and committed champions, to achieve 
21
this historic and transformative goal.’’.
