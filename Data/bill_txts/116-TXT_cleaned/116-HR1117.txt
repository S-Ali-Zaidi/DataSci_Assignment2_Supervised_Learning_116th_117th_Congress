and up to three times as likely than White Americans to 
have an amputation; 
Whereas if not properly diagnosed, peripheral artery disease 
can lead to nontraumatic lower limb amputations; 
Whereas unnecessary amputations drastically reduce the 
quality of life for peripheral artery disease patients; and 
Whereas educating people on the risks of peripheral artery 
disease and encouraging early screenings are crucial to 
preventing unnecessary amputations: Now, therefore, be 
it
