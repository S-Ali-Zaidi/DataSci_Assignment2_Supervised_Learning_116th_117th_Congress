ations: 
11
(1) How to promote an ecosystem of devices 
12
employing such sharing techniques or such other 
13
sharing strategies. 
14
(2) How to incentivize spectrum users to em-
15
ploy such sharing techniques or such other sharing 
16
strategies. 
17
(3) How to ensure that any Federal protection 
18
zones and corresponding technical rules and power 
19
levels are no more protective than necessary. 
20
(4) The applicability of such sharing techniques 
21
or such other sharing strategies to frequencies be-
22
tween 3100 megahertz and 3550 megahertz, inclu-
23
sive, and frequencies between 7125 megahertz and
