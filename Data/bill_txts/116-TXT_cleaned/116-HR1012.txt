ance available ‘‘to a unified command under the United 
States of America’’; 
Whereas, on July 27, 1953, an Armistice Agreement was 
signed by United States Army Lieutenant General Wil-
liam Harrison, Jr., representing the United Nations 
Command with the Korean People’s Army and the Chi-
nese People’s Volunteer Army to ‘‘ensure a complete ces-
sation of hostilities and of all acts of armed force in 
Korea until a final peaceful settlement is achieved’’; 
Whereas the Armistice Agreement remains in force today and 
that by its terms has neither formally ended the Korean 
war nor constituted a permanent settlement of peace on 
the Korean Peninsula; 
Whereas, on October 1, 1953, the Mutual Defense Treaty 
Between the United States and the Republic of Korea (5 
UST 2368) was signed in Washington with ratification

in force today ‘‘to strengthen their efforts for collective 
defense for the preservation of peace and security’’;

brance to be added to the Korean War Veterans Memo-
rial with the names of those that died in theater, are list-
ed as missing, or prisoners of war, and would also list the 
number of members of the Korean Augmentation to the 
United States Army (KATUSA) that were killed in ac-
tion, wounded in action, prisoners of war, or are listed 
as missing in action; 
Whereas the Korean war is no longer ‘‘The Forgotten War’’ 
but ‘‘The Forgotten Victory’’ and June 25, 1950, is con-
sidered the symbolic start of the ironclad United States- 
Korea alliance that was forged in blood; 
Whereas in the 70 years since the outbreak of the Korean 
conflict, the United States-Korea alliance has trans-
formed itself from a security relationship into a com-
prehensive global partnership; 
Whereas the Republic of Korea is considered one of the 
greatest success stories in the post-World War II era and 
constitutes one of the lynchpins of United States foreign 
policy in Northeast Asia; 
Whereas the United States and the Republic of Korea have 
stood shoulder to shoulder in all four major conflicts the 
United States has faced since the Korean war while 
maintaining peace on the Korean Peninsula; 
Whereas this partnership has contributed to regional and 
global prosperity through the shared values of democracy, 
free market economy, human rights, and the rule of law; 
Whereas it is in the national interest of the United States to 
maintain its forward deployed presence in the Republic of 
Korea through United States Forces Korea (USFK), a 
premier Joint Force that is ‘‘well led, disciplined, trained 
and ready to Fight Tonight and win’’;

recently led to important coordination and cooperation in 
confronting global pandemics including H1N1 in 2009, 
and COVID–19 in 2020; 
Whereas the Republic of Korea has made significant con-
tributions to the global community in combating and con-
taining COVID–19, including the manufacture and ex-
port of Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction 
(RT–PCR) test kits to the United States Government 
and various States; 
Whereas, on May 8, 2020, the Republic of Korea donated
