CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of Congress that the Secretary of the 
Navy should name the next Virginia-class submarine of 
the United States Navy the ‘‘USS Wisconsin’’. 
Whereas Wisconsin has a rich and historical connection to 
the United States Navy, evidenced particularly by the 
fact that the submarine fleet of the United States Navy 
produced 28 freshwater submarines for the World War II 
war effort; 
Whereas the first USS Wisconsin (BB–9) was an 11,565-ton 
Illinois-class battleship that was commissioned in 1901, 
sailed as the flagship of both the Pacific Squadron and 
Asiatic Fleet, and went on to sail in the Great White 
Fleet that circumnavigated the globe;

Whereas the USS Wisconsin (BB–64), commonly known as 
‘‘Big Wisky’’ and ‘‘the Last Battleship’’, was commis-
sioned in 1944 and served in every major conflict until 
its decommissioning in 1991, including World War II, the 
Korean War, and the Persian Gulf War; 
Whereas the USS Wisconsin (BB–64) continues to play a 
vital role in educating visitors to Hampton Roads, Vir-
ginia, about the famed history of the ship; 
Whereas individual citizens of Wisconsin have played a cru-
cial role in the history of the United States Navy, includ-
ing— 
(1) Admiral Marc A. Mitscher, who was one of the 
first aviators of the United States Navy and was born in 
Hillsboro, Wisconsin; and 
(2) Green Bay native Vice Admiral James H. 
Flatley, Jr., who was a key figure in the Battle of the 
Coral Sea and the Guadalcanal campaign; 
Whereas 63 citizens of Wisconsin have been recipients of a 
Medal of Honor, including 10 citizens of Wisconsin who 
have received a Medal of Honor from the Department of 
the Navy; and 
Whereas there has not been a USS Wisconsin in service for 
nearly 3 decades: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate 
1
concurring), That the Secretary of the Navy should name 
2
the next Virginia-class submarine of the United States 
3
Navy the ‘‘USS Wisconsin’’.
