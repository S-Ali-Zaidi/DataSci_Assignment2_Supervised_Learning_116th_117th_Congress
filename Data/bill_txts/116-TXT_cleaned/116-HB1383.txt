3
(1) Since January 2017 at least 35 human 
4

5
Vietnam. Nineteen of these individuals have already 
6
been convicted and sentenced to jail terms and the 
7
other 16 individuals have been formally charged and 
8
placed in pre-trial detention. These individuals have 
9
been sentenced to an estimated 1,000 years of im-
10

11
arrest. 
12
(2) There are over 100 Vietnamese currently 
13
detained or imprisoned for political or religious rea-
14
sons. Prisoners include human rights defenders, 
15
bloggers, lawyers, religious leaders, trade unionists, 
16
land rights activists, political dissidents, environ-
17
mental campaigners, and others arrested for exer-
18
cising their internationally guaranteed rights, such 
19
as the right to freedom of expression, to promote 
20

(3) There are also a significant number of reli-
22
gious prisoners affiliated with independent religious 
23
communities, including some who have actively en-
24
gaged in the promotion and protection of freedom of 
25

00:26 Mar 12, 2019
H1383

10 
•HR 1383 IH
(1) The promotion and protection of the univer-
1
sally recognized right to the freedom of religion is a 
2
priority of United States foreign policy as stated in 
3
section 402 of the International Religious Freedom 
4
Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6442) and the Bipartisan 
5
Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability 
6
Act of 2015 (title I of Public Law 114–26; 19 
7
U.S.C. 4201 et seq.) which requires the Administra-
8
tion to take religious freedom into account when ne-
9
gotiating trade agreements. 
10
(2) Countries that protect religious freedom are 
11
more prosperous, stable, peaceful and democratic. 
12
Thus, the severe restrictions faced by religious 
13
groups in Vietnam, such as members of the United 
14
Buddhist Church of Vietnam (UBCV), Catholics, 
15
and independent Hoa Hao Buddhists, Cao Dai, and 
16
Protestants groups, are detrimental to the interests 
17
of both the United States and Vietnam. 
18
(3) Since 2016, the Government of Vietnam has 
19
reportedly 
stepped 
up 
its 
efforts 
to 
force 
20
Montagnard and Hmong Christians to renounce 
21
their faith, expropriate lands and other real prop-
22

1
freedom remain in prison. 
2
(b) STATEMENT OF POLICY.—Since the protection of 
3
religious freedom is vital to peace, stability, and pros-
4
perity, and countries with the highest levels of restrictions 
5
on religious freedom are often those countries seeking to 
6
undermine United States national interests, it is the policy 
7
of the United States to— 
8
(1) prioritize religious freedom in bilateral rela-
9
tions, including with the Government of Vietnam, by 
10
fully implementing the provisions of the Frank R. 
11
Wolf International Religious Freedom Act (Public 
12
Law 114–281); and 
13
(2) strategically employ sanctions and other 
14
tools under the International Religious Freedom Act 
15
of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6401 et seq.). 
16
(c) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
17
gress that— 
18
(1) Vietnam should be designated as a country 
19
of particular concern for religious freedom under 
20
section 402(b) of the International Religious Free-
21
dom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6442(b)) because there 
22
are a significant number of individuals imprisoned

freedom and for ‘‘systematic, egregious, and ongo-
1
ing’’ violations of religious freedom; 
2
(2) the President, in making the annual des-
3
ignations under section 402(b) of such Act, should 
4
take into account the annual report of the United 
5
States Commission on International Religious Free-
6
dom under section 203 of such Act and the Commis-
7
sion’s assessment that the designation of Vietnam as 
8
a country of particular concern for religious freedom 
9
from 2004 to 2006 led to tangible improvements in 
10
religious freedom conditions while trade and security 
11
cooperation increased; and 
12
(3) because the Government of Vietnam tightly 
13
controls religious institutions and then persecutes 
14
those individuals who establish or operate inde-
15
pendent religious institutions and genuinely non-
16
governmental organizations, the Secretary of State 
17
should— 
18
(A) use all available diplomatic, develop-
19
ment, economic assistance, and political tools to 
20
ensure that independent religious and civil soci-
21
ety organizations can operate freely and without 
22
restriction in Vietnam; and

(B) raise these issues in all appropriate 
24
statements, dialogues, reports, and negotiations

(a) FINDING.—Congress finds that Vietnam con-
5
tinues to have one of the world’s most restrictive internet 
6
environments, with pervasive filtering of content and the 
7
frequent arrests of bloggers and others whose only offense 
8
is to advocate online for positions different than those held 
9
by the government.

open internet and the free flow of news and informa-
13
tion— 
14
(A) are fundamental components of United 
15
States foreign policy because they foster eco-
16

advance national security;

(B) are critical to the advancement of both 
19
United States economic interests and inter-
20
nationally recognized human rights globally;
