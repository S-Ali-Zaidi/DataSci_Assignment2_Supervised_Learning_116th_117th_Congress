SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds as follows: 
2
(1) The Indian Boarding School Policy was 
3
adopted by the United States Government to strip 
4
American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) chil-
5
dren of their indigenous identities, beliefs, and tradi-
6
tional languages to assimilate them into White 
7
American culture through federally funded Chris-
8
tian-run schools, which had the effect of cultural 
9
genocide. 
10
(2) For nearly a century, between 1869 and the 
11
1960s, the Federal Government implemented the In-
12
dian Boarding School Policy. This policy authorized 
13
the forced removal of hundreds of thousands of AI/ 
14
AN children, as young as 5 years old, relocating 
15
them from their homes in Tribal communities to one 
16
of the 367 Indian Boarding Schools across 30 
17
States. 
18
(3) By 1926, nearly 83 percent of AI/AN 
19
school-age children were enrolled in Indian boarding 
20
schools in the United States. However, because near-
21
ly 62 percent of the school records have been lost or 
22
destroyed, the full extent of the Federal Indian 
23
boarding school policy has not been identified. 
24
(4) Gen. Richard Henry Pratt, the founder and 
25
superintendent of the Carlisle Indian Industrial 
26

School in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, stated the ethos of 
1
this policy to ‘‘kill the Indian in him, and save the 
2
man’’. Founded in 1879, the Carlisle Indian School 
3
set the precedent as the first government-funded off- 
4
reservation Indian boarding school in the United 
5
States where over 10,000 AI/AN children were en-
6
rolled from over 140 Tribes. 
7
(5) The Indian Boarding School policy was de-
8
signed to assimilate AI/AN children into White 
9
American culture by stripping them of their cultural 
10
identities, often through physical, sexual, psycho-
11
logical, and spiritual abuse and neglect. Many of the 
12
children who were taken to boarding schools never 
13
returned to their communities. At the Carlisle In-
14
dian School alone, approximately 180 AI/AN chil-
15
dren were buried. 
16
(6) While attending Indian boarding schools, 
17
AI/AN children suffered additional psychological 
18
abuses as they were sent to White-owned homes and 
19
businesses for involuntary and unpaid manual labor 
20
work during the summers. Many children ran away 
21
and remained missing, or died of illnesses due to 
22
harsh living conditions, abuse, and/or substandard 
23
health care provided by the schools. 
24

•HR 8420 IH
(7) Many of the children were buried in un-
1
marked graves or off-campus cemeteries. Inaccurate, 
2
scattered, and missing school records make it nearly 
3
impossible for families to locate the final resting 
4
place of their loved ones, especially since only 38 
5
percent of the school’s records have been located 
6
from 142 of the known 367 boarding schools. 
7
(8) Parents of the children who were forcibly 
8
removed to the boarding schools were prohibited 
9
from visiting or engaging in correspondence with 
10
their children. Parental resistance to compliance 
11
with this harsh no-contact policy resulted in their in-
12
carceration or loss of access to basic provisions in-
13
cluding food rations, clothing, or both. 
14
(9) The 2018 Broken Promises Report pub-
15
lished by the United States Commission on Civil 
16
Rights reported that AI/AN communities continue to 
17
experience intergenerational trauma resulting from 
18
experiences in Indian Boarding Schools that divided 
19
cultural family structures, damaged indigenous iden-
20
tities, and inflicted chronic psychological ramifica-
21
tions on AI/AN children and families. 
22
(10) The Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
23
vention Kaiser Permanente Adverse Childhood Expe-
24
riences Study shows that adverse or traumatic child-

hood experiences disrupts brain development leading 
1
to a higher likelihood of negative health outcomes as 
2
adults including, but not limited to, heart disease, 
3
obesity, diabetes, and autoimmune diseases. AI/ANs 
4
suffer from disproportional rates of each of these 
5
diseases compared to the national average today. 
6
(11) The longstanding ramifications of the in-
7
humane treatment of AI/AN children and families at 
8
these boarding schools continues to impact Tribal 
9
communities through intergenerational trauma, cy-
10
cles of violence and abuse, disappearance, health dis-
11
parities, substance abuse, premature deaths, and ad-
12
ditional undocumented psychological trauma. 
13
(12) The continuing lasting implications of the 
14
Federal Indian Boarding School Policy and inhu-
15
mane treatment of AI/AN children and families in-
16
fluenced modern U.S. Department of the Interior’s 
17
Bureau of Indian Education (BIE)-operated schools. 
18
These schools have often failed to meet the many 
19
needs of nearly 50,000 AI/AN students across 23 
20
States. 
21
(13) The replication of assimilation policies of 
22
the boarding school era also presented itself through 
23
other Federal programs like the Indian Adoption 
24
Project (1958 to 1967) that placed AI/AN children 
25
20:29 Oct 24, 2020
H8420

•HR 8420 IH
in non-Indian households and institutions for foster 
1
care or adoption across 25 States. 
2
(14) The Association on American Indian Af-
3
fairs reported that the continuation of cultural geno-
4
cide and assimilation policies through Federal AI/ 
5
AN adoption and foster care programs between 
6
1941 to 1967 separated as many as one-third of Na-
7
tive American children from their families in Tribal 
8
communities, subsequently prompting the creation of 
9
the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) to stop the re-
10
moval of children. 
11
(15) In some States, over 50 percent of foster 
12
care children in State adoption systems are Native 
13
American. The general lack of public awareness, in-
14
formation, and acknowledgment of the residual im-
15
pacts of the Indian Boarding School Policy and in-
16
tergenerational trauma remain, signaling the over-
17
due need for an investigative Federal committee to 
18
further document and expose the assimilation and 
19
cultural genocide implemented under this policy.

study the impact and ongoing effects of historical 
4
and intergenerational trauma in Tribal communities, 
5
and to provide a forum for Indigenous victims and

7
psychological, and spiritual violence.

(2) To further develop recommendations for the 
9
Federal Government to acknowledge and heal the 
10
historical and intergenerational trauma caused by 
11
the Federal Indian Boarding School Policy and 
12
other cultural genocide practices, including rec-
