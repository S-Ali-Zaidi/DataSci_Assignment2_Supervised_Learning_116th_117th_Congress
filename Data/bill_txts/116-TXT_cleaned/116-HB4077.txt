Congress finds the following: 
9
(1) During the Holocaust, which took place 
10
from 1933 through 1945, an estimated 6,000,000 
11
21:52 Jul 26, 2019

•HR 4077 IH
Jews, as well as millions of victims from other tar-
1
geted groups, were murdered by the Nazis and their 
2
collaborators. 
3
(2) More than 200,000 Jews fleeing from Nazi- 
4
occupied territory found refuge in the United States 
5
from 1933 through 1945, and approximately 
6
137,000 additional Jewish refugees settled in the 
7
United States from 1945 through 1952. 
8
(3) Hundreds of thousands of additional Jewish 
9
refugees continued to immigrate to the United 
10
States from Europe and countries of the former So-
11
viet Union during the subsequent decades. 
12
(4) The number of Holocaust survivors living in 
13
the United States at the end of 2018 was approxi-
14
mately 80,000 individuals, down from an estimated 
15
127,000 in 2010. 
16
(5) Every Holocaust survivor is now at least 74 
17
years old, most are in at least their mid-to-late 
18
eighties, and many are in their nineties and beyond. 
19
(6) One-third of all Holocaust survivors in the 
20
United States live at or below the official poverty 
21
threshold (as defined by the Bureau of the Census), 
22
including more than half of the Holocaust survivors 
23
who emigrated from the countries of the former So-
24
viet Union.

(7) Holocaust survivors continue to live with 
1
the unique mental and physical scars of the uncon-
2
scionable trauma caused by the Holocaust, and while 
3
institutionalized settings are beneficial for some, cer-
4
tain aspects of institutionalization may have particu-
5
larly adverse effects on Holocaust survivors. 
6
(8) For many Holocaust survivors, institutional-
7
ized settings produce sights, sounds, smells, emo-
8
tions, and routines that can induce panic, anxiety, 
9
and re-traumatization as a result of experiences 
10
from the Holocaust. 
11
(9) Holocaust survivors are more economically 
12
and socially vulnerable, report poorer health and 
13
more health problems, and have greater social serv-
14
ice needs, than other older individuals. 
15
(10) In comparison to most other older individ-
16
uals, low-income Holocaust survivors are more reli-
17
ant on social service programs that provide services 
18
such as personal care, provision of home-delivered 
19
and congregate meals, transportation, counseling, 
20
and mental health support to promote health and 
21
quality of life. 
22
(11) Community organizations serving Holo-
23
caust survivors report that approximately one-quar-
24
ter of Holocaust survivors live alone, and living alone 
25

is a risk factor for hospitalization and nursing home 
1
admission, poverty, falls, depression, poor nutrition, 
2
social isolation, and loneliness, which have been as-
3
sociated with poor health outcomes and an increased 
4
risk of death. 
5
(12) Community organizations serving Holo-
6
caust survivors report that transportation is vital to 
7
help Holocaust survivors attend medical appoint-
8
ments, shop and purchase necessary items, visit 
9
family and friends, and participate in cultural, rec-
10
reational, or social events, such as congregate meals 
11
or religious services. 
12
(13) As the general population of older individ-
13
uals increases in the United States and many public 
14
or philanthropic resources remain constant, pro-
15
viders serving Holocaust survivors need additional 
16
capacity to cover needed services. 
17
(14) The Administration for Community Living 
18
in the Department of Health and Human Services 
19
serves as the Federal agency responsible for increas-
20
ing access to community supports for, focusing at-
21
tention and resources on the unique needs of, older 
22
individuals and individuals with disabilities across 
23
their lifespans.

•HR 4077 IH
(15) The mission of the Administration for 
1
Community Living is to maximize the independence, 
2
well-being, and health of older individuals, individ-
3
uals with disabilities, and their families and care-
4
givers. 
5
(16) The Administration for Community Living 
6
in 2017 issued guidance entitled ‘‘ACL Guidance for 
7
Outreach and Providing Services for Holocaust Sur-
8
vivors’’ in accordance with a requirement of the 
9
Older Americans Act Reauthorization Act of 2016 
10
which states that the Assistant Secretary for Aging 
11
shall ‘‘issue guidance to States, that shall be applica-
12
ble to States, area agencies on aging, and providers 
13
of services for older individuals, with respect to serv-
14
ing Holocaust survivors, including guidance on 
15
promising practices for conducting outreach to that 
16
population.’’. 
17
(17) Many social service agencies that receive 
18
funding under the Older Americans Act of 1965 for 
19
home-delivered or congregate meals serve diverse 
20
seniors, including Holocaust survivors, with special-
21
ized dietary needs based on religious, cultural, or 
22
ethnic requirements, and the necessary special meals 
23
often cost more than other meals.
