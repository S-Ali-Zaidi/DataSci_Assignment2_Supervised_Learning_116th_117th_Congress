A BILL 
To eliminate mandatory minimum sentences for all drug 
offenses. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Mandatory Minimum 
4
Reform Act of 2020’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress makes the following findings: 
7
(1) Mandatory minimum sentences are statu-
8
torily prescribed terms of imprisonment that auto-

matically attach upon conviction of certain criminal 
1
conduct, often pertaining to drug offenses. Absent 
2
very narrow criteria for relief, a sentencing judge is 
3
powerless to mandate a term of imprisonment below 
4
the mandatory minimum. Mandatory minimum sen-
5
tences for drug offenses rely solely upon the weight 
6
of the substance as a proxy for the defendant’s role 
7
and degree of involvement. 
8
(2) In the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, and 
9
at the height of the public concern over crack co-
10
caine, Congress acted hastily, without sufficient 
11
hearings, and enacted hard line penalties that tar-
12
geted low-level drug offenders. These penalties in-
13
cluded new, long mandatory minimum sentences for 
14
such offenders. 
15
(3) According to the Bureau of Prisons, in 
16
1986, when the new drug law containing lengthy 
17
mandatory minimum sentences passed, the prison 
18
population was 36,000. Today, the Federal prison 
19
population is over 177,000 up over 390 percent in 
20
33 years. 
21
(4) According to the Bureau of Prisons, the av-
22
erage cost to keep one prisoner in Federal prison for 
23
the fiscal year of 2017 was $36,299.25, which 
24
equates to $99.45 per day.

(5) Annual spending on the Federal prison sys-
1
tem rose by over 600 percent, from roughly 
2
$966,000,000 to more than $6.9 billion in inflation- 
3
adjusted dollars, between 1980 and 2015. 
4
(6) According to the U.S. Sentencing Commis-
5
sion, 69,425 offenders were sentenced in fiscal year 
6
2018. Of those, 18,964 offenders were sentenced for 
7
a drug trafficking offense; with over half (58.4 per-
8
cent) of all drug trafficking offenders convicted of 
9
an offense carrying a mandatory minimum penalty. 
10
(7) According to the U.S. Sentencing Commis-
11
sion, drug offenders released from prison in 1986 
12
who had been sentenced before the adoption of man-
13
datory sentences and sentencing guidelines had 
14
served an average of 22 months in prison. In fiscal 
15
year 2018, the average sentence for drug trafficking 
16
offenders subject to a mandatory minimum penalty 
17
was more than 10 years (131 months; 62 months 
18
with relief). 
19
(8) In fiscal year 2016, many of those offenders 
20
convicted of an offense carrying a mandatory min-
21
imum sentence were nonviolent or low-level offend-
22
ers. According to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, 
23
only 28.7 percent of convictions for drug trafficking 
24
offenses carrying a mandatory minimum penalty in-
25

•HR 7194 IH
volved the use of a weapon, violence, or threats of 
1
violence. Only 11.7 percent of offenders convicted of 
2
such offenses played a leadership role. 
3
(9) Mandatory minimum sentences have histori-
4
cally been shown to have a disproportionate impact 
5
on African Americans. The United States Sen-
6
tencing Commission, in a 15-year overview of the 
7
Federal sentencing system, concluded that ‘‘manda-
8
tory penalty statutes are used inconsistently’’ and 
9
disproportionately affect African-American defend-
10
ants. According to another United States Sentencing 
11
Commission report, in fiscal year 2016, of the 8,342 
12
offenders who were subject to a Federal mandatory 
13
minimum penalty at sentencing, Black offenders 
14
were the largest group, representing 35.5 percent, 
15
followed by White offenders, who represented 31.1 
16
percent, and Hispanic offenders, who represented 
17
30.9 percent. 
18
(10) According to the U.S. Sentencing Commis-
19
sion, between 1994 and 2003, the average time 
20
served by African Americans for a drug offense in-
21
creased by 62 percent, compared to a 17-percent in-
22
crease among White drug defendants. 
23
(11) According to the Substance Abuse and 
24
Mental Health Services Administration, surveys have 
25
20:58 Jul 08, 2020

•HR 7194 IH
documented that drug use is roughly consistent 
1
across racial and ethnic groups. While there is less 
2
data available regarding drug sellers, research from 
3
the Office of National Drug Control Policy and the 
4
National Institute of Justice has found that drug 
5
users generally buy drugs from someone of their own 
6
racial or ethnic background. But, according to the 
7
U.S. Sentencing Commission, about 73 percent of all 
8
drug offenders sentenced in 2018 were African 
9
American and Hispanic, many of whom are low-level 
10
offenders. 
11
(12) As a result of Federal prosecutors’ focus 
12
on low-level drug offenders, the overwhelming major-
13
ity of individuals subject to the heightened crack co-
14
caine penalties are African American. According to 
15
the U.S. Sentencing Commission, in fiscal year 
16
2016, of those offenders sentenced on Federal crack 
17
cocaine charges, only 5.5 percent were White, while 
18
82.6 percent and 11.4 percent were African Amer-
19
ican and Hispanic, respectively. 
20
(13) According to the U.S. Census, African 
21
Americans comprise 13.3 percent of the U.S. popu-
22
lation, but according to the U.S. Sentencing Com-
23
mission, in fiscal year 2018 African Americans made 
24
up 24.9 percent of all drug trafficking offenders.

•HR 7194 IH
(14) According to the U.S. Sentencing Commis-
1
sion, in fiscal year 2016, about 34.6 percent of 
2
women entering Federal prison did so for a drug of-
3
fense. Linking drug quantity with punishment sever-
4
ity has had a particularly profound impact on 
5
women, who are historically more likely to play pe-
6
ripheral roles in a drug enterprise than men. How-
7
ever, because prosecutors can attach drug quantities 
8
to an individual regardless of the level of a defend-
9
ant’s participation in the charged offense, women 
10
have been exposed to increasingly punitive sentences. 
11
(15) Low-level and mid-level drug offenders can 
12
be adequately prosecuted by the States and punished 
13
or supervised in treatment as appropriate. 
14
(16) Congress has an obligation to taxpayers to 
15
use sentencing policies that are cost-effective and in-
16
crease public safety, in addition to establishing a 
17
criminal justice system that is fair, efficient, and 
18
provides just sentences for offenders. Mandatory 
19
sentences have not been conclusively shown to re-
20
duce recidivism or deter crime. 
21
(17) The limited resources in the Federal crimi-
22
nal justice system should be used to protect society 
23
by incapacitating dangerous and violent offenders 
24
who pose a threat to public safety.
