To rename the Oyster Bay National Wildlife Refuge as the 
Congressman Lester Wolff Oyster Bay National Wildlife 
Refuge. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. FINDINGS. 
3
The Congress finds the following: 
4
(1) The Oyster Bay National Wildlife Refuge 
5
was created in 1968. It is located on the north shore 
6
of Long Island in eastern Nassau County, is the 
7
largest refuge in the Long Island National Wildlife

Refuge Complex, and receives the most public use of 
1
all the refuges in the Complex. 
2
(2) The State of New York designated Oyster 
3
Bay a significant coastal fish and wildlife habitat. It 
4
is especially important for wintering waterfowl such 
5
as black duck, greater scaup, bufflehead, canvasback 
6
and long-tailed ducks. Management activities include 
7
wetland restoration and protection of the natural 
8
shoreline and vegetation. 
9
(3) The refuge is unique in consisting solely of 
10
bay bottom and adjacent shoreline up to the mean 
11
high-tide mark. Ninety percent of New York’s com-
12
mercial oyster harvest comes from the refuge. Visi-
13
tors enjoy fishing, wildlife observation, photography 
14
and environmental education. The refuge is truly a 
15
national treasure. 
16
(4) Many visitors are unaware that were it not 
17
for the tireless work and advocacy of then-freshman 
18
Congressman Lester Wolff, this area would today be 
19
an 8.5-mile causeway and bridge across Long Island 
20
Sound between Oyster Bay and Rye, New York, con-
21
necting Nassau and Westchester Counties. 
22
(5) The bridge was first proposed by Robert 
23
Moses, the well-known New York City Planner, to 
24
divert traffic from New York City. Former Governor

Nelson Rockefeller signed into law legislation cre-
1
ating the bridge authorized by the New York State 
2
Legislature in 1967. 
3
(6) Congressman Wolff, elected in 1964, quick-
4
ly decided the bridge would be an intrusion in a pris-
5
tine area, and that Long Island Sound was a very 
6
precious resource that was despoiled. The conserva-
7
tion threats in the mid-1960s were suburban devel-
8
opment, wetland filling, and industrial pollution. The 
9
fight to preserve this land became an enormous po-
10
litical fight and is considered to be a turning point 
11
in New York State’s environmental legacy. 
12
(7) With State and local political and commu-
13
nity leaders, and especially the North Shore leaders 
14
and the Committee to Save the Long Island Sound, 
15
Congressman Wolff arranged a meeting with De-
16
partment of the Interior representatives and local 
17
leaders where the idea of creating a wildlife refuge 
18
from municipal and privately owned wetlands was 
19
created. 
20
(8) The Town of Oyster Bay, in which one end 
21
of the bridge was to be located, deeded 5,000 acres 
22
of wetlands to the United States to be maintained 
23
as a Federal wildlife preserve. It was stipulated that 
24
if the Department of the Interior agreed to an intru-

sion of the property, it would revert to the town. 
1
Creating a Federal wildlife preserve provided the 
2
land with Federal protection. 
3
(9) Because of the vision, dedication, and perse-
4
verance of Congressman Lester Wolff, all of us and 
5
future generations can enjoy the beauty and mag-
6
nificence of this refuge.
