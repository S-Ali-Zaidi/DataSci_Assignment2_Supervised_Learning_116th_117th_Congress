RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the Fourth of July, America’s birth-
day, and bringing celebration and fireworks to our Na-
tion’s ‘‘Shrine of Democracy’’ at Mount Rushmore. 
Whereas, on July 3, 1776, Founding Father John Adams 
wrote to Abigail Adams expressing his belief that the 
signing of the Declaration of Independence should be 
commemorated ‘‘with Pomp and Parade, with Shows, 
Games, Sports, Guns, Bells, Bonfires and Illuminations 
from one End of this Continent to the other from this 
Time forward forever more’’; 
Whereas, on July 4, 1777, reflecting the vision of John 
Adams, fireworks were set off in Philadelphia as part of 
a celebration to commemorate Independence Day;

towns large and small have celebrated the birth of our 
great Nation; 
Whereas an estimated 49 million Americans traveled on vaca-
tion to these cities and towns during the Fourth of July 
holiday in 2019; 
Whereas for the first time in over 10 years, Mount Rush-
more, our Nation’s ‘‘Shrine of Democracy’’, will resume 
using fireworks in 2020; 
Whereas many cities and towns across the country are can-
celing or are considering canceling their annual Fourth of 
July celebrations: Now, therefore, be it

3
pendence Day celebrations;
