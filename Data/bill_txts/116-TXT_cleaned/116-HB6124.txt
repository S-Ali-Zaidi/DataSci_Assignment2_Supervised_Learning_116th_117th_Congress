•HR 6124 IH
(1) In recognition that trade policy can result 
1
in disparate and disruptive changes to the economy, 
2
the Trade Adjustment Assistance program was en-
3
acted to help workers adversely impacted by the 
4
trade policy decisions of the Federal Government. 
5
(2) The Trump Administration has made clear 
6
that it intends to aggressively use Federal trade 
7
statutes, including section 232 of the Trade Expan-
8
sion Act of 1962 (19 U.S.C. 1862) and section 301 
9
of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2411), and po-
10
tentially the International Emergency Economic 
11
Powers Act (Public Law 95–223), to increase tariffs 
12
on selected imports. 
13
(3) Foreign countries affected by such tariff in-
14
creases have, as of the date of the enactment of this 
15
Act, already raised tariffs on United States exports 
16
or have indicated that they intend to respond by 
17
raising tariffs on such exports. 
18
(4) Increased tariffs on such exports threaten 
19
to reduce employment in affected sectors of the 
20
United States economy. 
21
(5) Firms adversely impacted by these effects 
22
deserve adjustment assistance.
