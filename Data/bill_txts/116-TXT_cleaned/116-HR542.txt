Whereas grandparents and other relatives residing in urban, 
rural, and suburban households in every county of the 
United States have stepped forward out of love and loy-
alty to care for children during times in which biological 
parents are unable to do so; 
Whereas kinship caregivers provide safety, promote well- 
being, and establish stable households for vulnerable chil-
dren; 
Whereas kinship care enables a child— 
(1) to maintain family relationships and cultural 
heritage; and 
(2) to remain in the community of the child; 
Whereas kinship care is a national resource that provides lov-
ing homes for children at risk; 
Whereas kinship caregivers face daunting challenges to keep 
countless children from entering foster care; 
Whereas the House of Representatives is proud to recognize 
the many kinship care families in which a child is raised 
by grandparents or other relatives; 
Whereas the House of Representatives wishes to honor the 
many kinship caregivers who throughout the history of 
the United States have provided loving homes for 
parentless children; 
Whereas National Kinship Care Month provides an oppor-
tunity to urge people in every State to join in recognizing 
and celebrating kinship caregiving families and the tradi-
tion of families in the United States to help raise chil-
dren; and 
Whereas much remains to be done to ensure that all children 
have a safe, loving, nurturing, and permanent family, re-
gardless of age or special needs: Now, therefore, be it
