SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Prenatal Non-
2
discrimination Act of 2019’’ or the ‘‘PRENDA Act of 
3
2019’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY. 
5
(a) FINDINGS.—The Congress makes the following 
6
findings: 
7
(1) Women and girls possess the same funda-
8
mental human rights and civil rights as men and are 
9
essential to the formation of stable, peaceful soci-
10
eties. 
11
(2) Approximately 126,000,000 women and 
12
girls are missing from the world population due to 
13
systematic violence against women and girls, par-
14
ticularly sex-selection abortions, according to the 
15
United Nations Population Fund. 
16
(3) United States law prohibits the dissimilar 
17
treatment of males and females who are similarly 
18
situated and prohibits sex discrimination in various 
19
contexts, including the provision of employment, 
20
education, housing, health insurance coverage, and 
21
athletics. 
22
(4) A ‘‘sex-selection abortion’’ is an abortion 
23
undertaken for purposes of eliminating an unborn 
24
child of an undesired sex. Sex-selection abortion is 
25
described by scholars and civil rights advocates as

•HR 2373 IH
an act of sex-based or gender-based violence, predi-
1
cated on sex discrimination. By definition, sex-selec-
2
tion abortions do not implicate the health of the 
3
mother of the unborn, but instead are elective proce-
4
dures motivated by sex or gender bias. 
5
(5) The targeted victims of sex-selection abor-
6
tions performed in the United States and worldwide 
7
are overwhelmingly female. 
8
(6) Sex-selection abortions are not expressly 
9
prohibited by United States law, and only 7 States 
10
ban abortions for reason of sex selection at some 
11
point in pregnancy. Sex is an immutable char-
12
acteristic ascertainable at the earliest stages of 
13
human development through existing medical tech-
14
nology and procedures commonly in use, including 
15
maternal-fetal bloodstream DNA sampling, amnio-
16
centesis, chorionic villus sampling or ‘‘CVS’’, and 
17
obstetric ultrasound. 
18
(7) Sex-selection abortions have the effect of di-
19
minishing the representation of women in the Amer-
20
ican population, and therefore, the American elec-
21
torate. 
22
(8) Sex-selection abortions reinforce sex dis-
23
crimination and have no place in a civilized society.

•HR 2373 IH
(9) The history of the United States includes 
1
many examples of sex discrimination. The people of 
2
the United States ultimately responded in the 
3
strongest possible legal terms by enacting a constitu-
4
tional amendment correcting an element of this dis-
5
crimination. Women, once subjected to sex discrimi-
6
nation that denied them the right to vote, now have 
7
suffrage guaranteed by the 19th Amendment. The 
8
elimination of discriminatory practices has been and 
9
is among the highest priorities and greatest achieve-
10
ments of American history. 
11
(10) Implicitly approving the discriminatory 
12
practices of sex-selection abortion by choosing not to 
13
prohibit them will reinforce sex discrimination, and 
14
coarsen society to the value of females. Thus, Con-
15
gress has a compelling interest in acting—indeed it 
16
must act—to prohibit sex-selection abortion. 
17
(b) CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY.—In accordance 
18
with the above findings, Congress enacts the following 
19
pursuant to Congress’ power under— 
20
(1) the Commerce Clause; 
21
(2) section 5 of the 14th Amendment, including 
22
the power to enforce the prohibition on government 
23
action denying equal protection of the laws; and
