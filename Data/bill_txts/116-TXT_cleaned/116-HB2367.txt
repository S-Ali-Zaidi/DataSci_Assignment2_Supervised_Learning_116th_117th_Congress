‘‘(iii) ASSUMPTIONS
AND
RULES.— 
1
Not later than 1 year after the date of the 
2
enactment of the Lifetime Income Disclo-

‘‘(I) prescribe assumptions that 
5
administrators of individual account

plans may use in converting total ac-
7
crued benefits into lifetime income

stream equivalents for purposes of 
9
this subparagraph; and

‘‘(II) issue interim final rules 
11
under clause (i).

In prescribing assumptions under sub-
13
clause (I), the Secretary may prescribe a 
14
single set of specific assumptions (in which 
15
case the Secretary may issue tables or fac-
16
tors that facilitate such conversions), or 
17
ranges of permissible assumptions. To the 
18
extent that an accrued benefit is or may be 
19
invested in a lifetime income stream de-
20
scribed in clause (i)(III), the assumptions 
21
prescribed under subclause (I) shall, to the 
22
extent appropriate, permit administrators 
23
of individual account plans to use the

amounts payable under such lifetime in-
