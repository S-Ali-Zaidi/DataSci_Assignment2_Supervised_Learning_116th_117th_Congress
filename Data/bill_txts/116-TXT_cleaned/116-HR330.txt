RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for honoring Earth Day, and for other 
purposes. 
Whereas Earth Day was first celebrated on April 22, 1970; 
Whereas the late Senator Gaylord Nelson, the founder of 
Earth Day, called on the people of the United States to 
hold elected officials accountable for failing to adequately 
protect the health of people and the natural environment; 
Whereas after witnessing years of environmental neglect, mil-
lions of Americans of all ages, walks of life, and political 
affiliations gathered in cities across the Nation on the 
first Earth Day to demand basic protections for our plan-
et and to commit to leaving behind a healthier world for 
the next generation; 
Whereas Earth Day united people who had been fighting 
against oil spills, polluting factories and power plants, 
raw sewage and toxic dumps, the loss of wildlife, and 
other environmental ills; 
Whereas that work continues today; 
Whereas Earth Day is an annual event created to promote 
environmental citizenship and action year-round; 
Whereas the first celebration of Earth Day was the largest 
environmental grassroots event ever held at that time and 
is widely credited with launching the modern environ-
mental movement; 
Whereas the voices of inaugural Earth Day participants gal-
vanized an unparalleled period of legislative and grass-
roots activity that changed the way we interact with the 
environment, leading to the creation of the Environ-
mental Protection Agency, and passage of legislation

such as the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, and the 
Endangered Species Act; 
Whereas by 1990, Earth Day was celebrated globally, with 
200,000,000 people in 141 countries participating in 
Earth Day events; 
Whereas Earth Day encourages environmental activism and 
stewardship around the world, and reminds people to find 
ways to protect the environment, including managing 
their own environmental impact; 
Whereas on Earth Day, people engage in projects, initiatives, 
and campaigns to protect and restore the planet includ-
ing planting trees, removing litter, cleaning up coral 
reefs, conserving water and energy, and other environ-
mentally responsible actions; 
Whereas new and continuing challenges, including climate 
change, pollution, and loss of forest, wetlands, and other 
wildlife habitats, reinforce the need for adequate protec-
tions for the air we breathe, the water we drink, the land 
we inhabit, and the animals we live alongside; 
Whereas Earth Day reaffirms our national responsibility in 
the global effort to combat climate change and protect 
our planet for all; 
Whereas Earth Day encourages us to acknowledge the preva-
lence of environmental injustices that directly affect the 
health and well-being of individuals and communities 
across the country, and affirms our commitment to ame-
liorating existing environmental injustices, and to pre-
venting future injustices; 
Whereas Earth Day reminds us of the need to expand envi-
ronmental and climate literacy not only to strengthen en-
vironmental and climate protections but also to accelerate
