(1) Puget Sound and its tributary waters are 
1
one of the most ecologically diverse ecosystems in 
2
North America with natural resources that have eco-
3
logical, economic, and cultural importance to the 
4
United States and the many Tribal nations that 
5
have stewarded it for millennia. The health and pro-
6
ductivity of Puget Sound is not only the cornerstone 
7
of the region’s quality of life and vibrant economy, 
8
but its word-class salmon fishery, commercial aqua-
9
culture, agriculture, and port activities ripple 
10
throughout the Nation. 
11
(2) Threats to Puget Sound, such as water pol-
12
lution, sediment contamination, environmental deg-
13
radation, and habitat loss, jeopardize the economic 
14
productivity and natural resources that support the 
15
increasing population of the region. 
16
(3) For nearly a decade, State, local, and Tribal 
17
governments, cooperative partnerships, and con-
18
cerned citizens have worked together in a deliberate 
19
and coordinated way to direct and manage public re-
20
source allocation toward habitat restoration, improv-
21
ing water quality and shellfish farms, and developing 
22
a body of scientific knowledge, all of which have ad-
23
vanced the Puget Sound recovery efforts.

(4) Tribal governments with treaty-reserved 
1
rights in the natural resources of Puget Sound have 
2
long served as co-managers of fishery resources, 
3
have engaged in Puget Sound Partnership processes 
4
and public forums to encourage a holistic and sci-
5
entific approach to recovery efforts, and have contin-
6
ued in their role as stewards of Puget Sound, includ-
7
ing by engaging with multi-faceted restoration and 
8
protection actions, and are thus an indispensable, 
9
equal partner in all Puget Sound recovery actions. 
10
(5) Despite significant and nationally recog-
11
nized accomplishments, the rate of damage to Puget 
12
Sound still exceeds the rate of recovery. To outpace 
13
mounting pollutants and other cascading negative 
14
impacts, the next step in fortifying the recovery sys-
15
tem is to align Federal recovery and protection ef-
16
forts seamlessly with State, local, and Tribal invest-
17
ments. 
18
(6) At this time, water and air pollution, sedi-
19
ment contamination, habitat loss and decline, and 
20
water flow disruption continue to devastate the fish, 
21
marine mammal, bird, and shellfish populations of 
22
Puget Sound, threatening local economies and Tribal

covery and protection of which will significantly con-
15
tribute to the environmental, cultural, and economic 
16
well-being of the United States and the many Tribal 
17
nations that have stewarded it for millennia; 
18
(2) a more deliberate coordination of Federal

20
and preservation efforts will be the most effective 
21
and efficient use of public resources; and
