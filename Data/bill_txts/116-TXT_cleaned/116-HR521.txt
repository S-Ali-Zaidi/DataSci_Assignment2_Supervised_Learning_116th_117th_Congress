‘‘Huawei operated Skycom as an unofficial subsidiary to 
obtain otherwise prohibited U.S.-origin goods, technology, 
and services, including banking services, for Huawei’s 
Iran-based business while concealing the link to Huawei’’; 
Whereas the United States Government is seeking the extra-

grave consequences, and [Canada] will have to bear the 
full responsibility for it’’;

detained Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and Cana-
dian executive Michael Spavor on December 10, 2018, in 
apparent retaliation for the arrest of Meng Wanzhou; 
Whereas Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig have faced 
harsh conditions while in detention that include limited 
consular access, no access to a lawyer, being unable to 
turn off the lights at night, and lengthy interrogations, 
including in the case of Mr. Kovrig, about his official ac-
tivities during his previous tenure as an accredited dip-
lomat in the People’s Republic of China, potentially in 
violation of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Rela-
tions, done at Vienna April 18, 1961;

his case reviewed and his 15-year sentence changed to

Human 
Rights 
Practices 
for 
2018 
stated 
that 
‘‘[a]rbitrary arrest and detention remained serious prob-
lems’’ in China and that Chinese judges ‘‘regularly re-
ceived political guidance on pending cases, including in-
structions on how to rule, from both the government and 
the CCP [Chinese Communist Party], particularly in po-
litically sensitive cases’’; and 
Whereas while neither Michael Kovrig nor Michael Spavor 
has been formally charged with any crime under Chinese 
law, the Government of the People’s Republic of China
