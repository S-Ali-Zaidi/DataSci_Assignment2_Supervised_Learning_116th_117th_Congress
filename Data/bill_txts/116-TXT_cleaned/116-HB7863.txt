•HR 7863 IH
(1) Congress should enact tax reform that re-

peals unfair and unnecessary tax loopholes and ex-

penditures, simplifies the system for millions of tax-

payers and businesses, and makes sure that the 
4
wealthiest taxpayers pay a fair share; and

quickly and serve as a floor on taxes for the highest- 
7
income taxpayers, cut the deficit by billions of dol-
8
lars a year, and help encourage more fundamental

reform of the tax system.
