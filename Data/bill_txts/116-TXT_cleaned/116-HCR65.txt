United States and defending the authority of States 
under the Clean Air Act to protect the people of those 
States from harmful air pollution. 
Whereas Congress enacted the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 
7401 et seq.), which requires the Administrator of the 
Environmental Protection Agency to set standards con-
trolling air pollutant emissions from motor vehicles to 
prevent the endangerment of public health and welfare; 
Whereas motor vehicle pollution contributes to serious health 
problems faced by the people of the United States, in-
cluding— 
(1) asthma attacks; 
(2) heart attacks; 
(3) lung cancer; and 
(4) premature death; 
Whereas through climate change, greenhouse gas (referred to 
in this preamble as ‘‘GHG’’) emissions from motor vehi-
cles contribute to other health burdens, including— 
(1) worsened air pollution; 
(2) extreme heat; 
(3) increased spread of infectious diseases; and 
(4) exacerbated natural disasters; 
Whereas all people of the United States are vulnerable to the 
health impacts of GHGs, but many individuals and com-
munities are at a greater risk of experiencing those im-
pacts, including— 
(1) children; 
(2) the elderly; 
(3) individuals with lung and heart disease; 
(4) low-income communities; and 
(5) communities of color;

Whereas recent reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change and the United States Global Change 
Research Program affirm the need to mitigate climate 
change and its impacts; 
Whereas section 209 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7543) 
preserves the authority of the State of California to set 
vehicle emissions standards that, in the aggregate, are at 
least as protective of public health and welfare as applica-
ble Federal vehicle emissions standards; 
Whereas section 177 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7507) 
allows States other than California to adopt the stand-
ards, which are, in the aggregate, at least as protective 
of public health and welfare as applicable Federal vehicle 
emissions standards, set by California in lieu of the Fed-
eral requirements; 
Whereas the Environmental Protection Agency (referred to in 
this preamble as the ‘‘EPA’’) has authority under the 
Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) to regulate GHG 
emissions from vehicles; 
Whereas the States of California, Colorado, Connecticut, 
Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, 
New 
York, 
Oregon, 
Pennsylvania, 
Rhode 
Island, 
Vermont, and Washington have exercised the authority to 
adopt, pursuant to the rights of those States preserved 
under section 177 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7507), 
vehicle emissions standards adopted by California that 
are, in the aggregate, at least as protective of public 
health and welfare as the otherwise applicable standards 
set by the Federal Government; 
Whereas the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 
6201 et seq.) and the Ten-in-Ten Fuel Economy Act

(Public Law 110–140; 121 Stat. 1498) require the Sec-
retary of Transportation to set maximum feasible cor-
porate average fuel economy standards, with the ultimate 
goal of promoting energy savings and reducing oil con-
sumption; 
Whereas the Federal Government, the State of California, 
and the automobile industry have agreed to a coordinated 
set of regulations, known as the ‘‘One National Pro-
gram’’, that— 
(1) aligns, as closely as possible, the model years 
2012 and later Federal light-duty vehicle GHG emissions 
standards and fuel economy standards with the light-duty 
vehicle GHG emissions standards adopted by California; 
and 
(2) sets achievable standards for light-duty vehicle 
GHG emissions and fuel economy that increase in strin-
gency through model year 2025; 
Whereas the EPA, the National Highway Traffic Safety Ad-
ministration, and the California Air Resources Board 
have collaborated on an extensive analysis that clearly 
demonstrates that the Federal GHG emission standards 
and the Federal fuel economy standards adopted in 2012 
for model years 2017–2025— 
(1) can be met with a wide range of technologies; 
(2) are expected to be met with advanced gasoline 
technologies; and 
(3) will accommodate contemporary consumer pur-
chasing trends; 
Whereas, in January 2017, the Administrator of the EPA 
issued a final determination to maintain the existing 
GHG emissions standards for vehicles of model year 
2022 through 2025, based on the extensive technical

record showing that those standards are appropriate and 
achievable; 
Whereas the light-duty vehicle GHG emissions and fuel econ-
omy standards of the United States— 
(1) support more than 288,000 automobile manufac-
turing jobs across 1,200 facilities in the United States; 
(2) keep automobile companies in the United States 
globally competitive as other countries adopt strict clean 
vehicle emissions standards; and 
(3) protect consumers in the United States from 
dirtier and more costly technology; 
Whereas the transportation sector has surpassed the energy 
sector as the largest source of GHG emissions in the 
United States; 
Whereas the light-duty vehicle GHG emissions and fuel econ-
omy standards of the United States, if fully implemented 
through model year 2025, will— 
(1) reduce the consumption of oil in the United 
States by 2,400,000 barrels per day; 
(2) 
save 
consumers 
in 
the 
United 
States 
$130,000,000,000 at the gas pump by 2030; and 
(3) reduce GHG emissions in the United States by 
470,000,000 metric tons by 2030; 
Whereas the light-duty vehicle GHG emissions and fuel econ-
omy standards of the United States protect low-income 
communities and communities of color from being dis-
proportionately affected by public health and economic 
burdens; and 
Whereas 87 percent of people in the United States— 
(1) support maintaining strong clean vehicle emis-
sions standards; and

Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate 
1
concurring), That Congress— 
2
(1) supports the existing set of regulations, 
3
known as the ‘‘One National Program’’, which con-
4
tains the goals of— 
5
(A) reducing greenhouse gas (referred to 
6
in this resolving clause as ‘‘GHG’’) emissions 
7
and oil usage; 
8
(B) protecting national security; and 
9
(C) protecting human health and welfare;

and 
11
(2) to meet those goals, supports policies that— 
12
(A) achieve maximum feasible reductions 
13
in oil use; 
14
(B) reduce GHG emissions from mobile

(C) recognize the rights and importance of 
17
States under cooperative federalism to choose to
