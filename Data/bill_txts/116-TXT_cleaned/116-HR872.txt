RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the vital importance of Native American 
participation in the 2020 decennial census of population. 
Whereas the 2020 United States census is an opportunity to 
provide a better future for Tribal Nations by providing 
an accurate count of American Indians and Alaska Na-
tives; 
Whereas the Federal Government, Tribal Nations, and deci-
sion makers will use 2020 census data in a variety of 
ways that can benefit Tribal Nations; 
Whereas under the Federal Indian trust responsibility, the 
United States has a legally enforceable fiduciary obliga-
tion to protect Tribal treaty rights, lands, assets, and re-
sources, as well as a duty to carry out the mandates of

Federal law with respect to American Indian and Alaska 
Native Nations; 
Whereas 2020 census data will be used to evaluate govern-
ment programs and policies to ensure they fairly and eq-
uitably serve the needs of all groups of people and to 
monitor compliance with antidiscrimination laws, regula-
tions, and policies; 
Whereas States will also use 2020 census data to meet legis-
lative redistricting and apportionment requirements; 
Whereas many Tribal Nations will use census data to make 
governmental decisions on allocating resources, the needs 
of their communities, economic development opportuni-
ties, and areas of growth for future decision making; 
Whereas American Indians and Alaska Natives have histori-
cally been at a higher risk for undercounting in the cen-
sus than other populations; 
Whereas, in the 2010 census, the Census Bureau estimates 
that American Indians and Alaska Natives living on res-
ervations or in Native villages were undercounted by ap-
proximately 
4.9 
percent, 
more 
than 
double 
the 
undercount rate of the next closest population group; 
Whereas 2020 census data will affect the allocation of ap-
proximately $1,500,000,000,000 in Federal funds; 
Whereas 2020 census responses can help shape how billions 
of dollars in Federal funds are allocated each year to 
Tribal Nations in furtherance of the Federal trust re-
sponsibility; 
Whereas undercounting of American Indian and Alaska Na-
tives could significantly undercut Federal funding levels 
for various programs for 10 years;

•HRES 872 IH 
Whereas Federal funding for Indian schools and education 
programs, Native American workforce programs, Indian 
health programs, Indian housing programs, water and 
sewage projects, roads, and economic development are 
based on data collected by the Census Bureau every 10 
years; 
Whereas over 300 Federal spending programs rely on data 
derived from the census to guide the geographic distribu-
tion of funds to States, counties, cities, and households; 
Whereas responses to the 2020 census are confidential and 
protected by law; 
Whereas personal information is never shared by the Census 
Bureau with any other government agencies or law en-
forcement, including Federal, local, and Tribal authori-
ties; 
Whereas census responses cannot be used against individuals 
by any government agency or court in any way—not by 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation, not by the Central 
Intelligence Agency, not by the Department of Homeland 
Security, and not by U.S. Immigration and Customs En-
forcement; and 
Whereas the 2020 census will offer households the option to 
respond online, by mail, by phone, or in person: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-

(1) ensuring an accurate count of American In-

dians and Alaska Natives is vital for the essence and

purpose of the 2020 decennial census of population;

(2) an undercount of American Indians and

Alaska Natives could result in significant underrep-

and Alaska Native Nations and households; and 
4
(3) the Federal Government, State and local

governments, and Tribal Nations should work to-

2020 decennial census of population among Amer-

form the public that the 2020 decennial census of

population is safe, easy, and important.
