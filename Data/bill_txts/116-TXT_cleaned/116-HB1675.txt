to accommodate the conversion of heavy crude oils 
1
into refined petroleum products. 
2
(2) As coking capacity has grown, the domestic 
3
production of petroleum coke is expected to grow, 
4
leading to increases in the storage, transportation, 
5
and use of the material. 
6
(3) In Detroit, piles of petroleum coke have 
7
been stored in the open air on the banks of the De-
8
troit River. 
9
(4) Uncovered piles of petroleum coke have also 
10
been stored in Southeast Chicago near homes and 
11
local baseball fields. 
12
(5) State regulators, communities, and industry 
13
stakeholders would benefit from a complete under-
14
standing of petroleum coke and the potential impact 
15
on public health and the environment related to the 
16
production, transportation, storage, and use of pe-
17
troleum coke.
