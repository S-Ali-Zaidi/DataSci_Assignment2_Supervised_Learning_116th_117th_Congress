•HR 4307 IH
(1) An underproduction in housing units rel-
1
ative to demand has led to a national housing short-
2
age. 
3
(2) The shortage of housing leaves 47 percent 
4
of households cost-burdened, paying more than 30 
5
percent of their income on rent. 
6
(3) The number of housing units underpro-
7
duced from 2000 through 2015 is equal to 7.3 mil-
8
lion units in 23 States. 
9
(4) Lack of housing supply and rising rent 
10
costs exacerbate inequality and reduce opportunity 
11
for many Americans. 
12
(5) Over half of all renters are cost-burdened, 
13
paying more than 30 percent of their income for 
14
housing, and 71 percent of extremely low-income 
15
households are severely cost-burdened, paying more 
16
than half of their income for housing. 
17
(6) Low-income households often live far from 
18
their jobs which may result in long commute times, 
19
increased cost burdens, and limitations on the jobs 
20
they can access. 
21
(7) Low-income households who live near public 
22
transit have lower cost burdens than those who live 
23
far from public transit.

(8) Public transit system ridership is higher if 
1
more housing is located within walking distance of 
2
transit stations. 
3
(9) Housing built around transit stops should 
4
target middle-income families, particularly those 
5
with 60 to 100 percent area median income.
