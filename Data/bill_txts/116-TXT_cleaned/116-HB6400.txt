•HR 6400 IH
(1) As of the date of introduction of this Act, 
1
the novel coronavirus has spread to all 50 States, 
2
the District of Columbia, and 3 territories. 
3
(2) The Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
4
vention have projected that between 160,000,000 
5
and 214,000,000 people could be infected by the 
6
novel coronavirus in the United States over the 
7
course of the pandemic. 
8
(3) Although the United States has less than 5 
9
percent of the world’s population, the United States 
10
holds approximately 21 percent of the world’s pris-
11
oners and leads the world in the number of individ-
12
uals incarcerated, with nearly 2,200,000 people in-
13
carcerated in State and Federal prisons and local 
14
jails. 
15
(4) Studies have shown that individuals age out 
16
of crime starting around 25 years of age, and re-
17
leased individuals over the age of 50 have a very low 
18
recidivism rate. 
19
(5) According to public health experts, incarcer-
20
ated individuals are particularly vulnerable to being 
21
gravely impacted by the novel corona virus pandemic 
22
because— 
23
(A) they have higher rates of underlying 
24
health issues than members of the general pub-

lic, including higher rates of respiratory disease, 
1
heart disease, diabetes, obesity, HIV/AIDS, 
2
substance abuse, hepatitis, and other conditions 
3
that suppress immune response; and 
4
(B) the close conditions and lack of access 
5
to hygiene products in prisons make these insti-
6
tutions 
unusually 
susceptible 
to 
viral 
7
pandemics. 
8
(6) The spread of communicable viral disease in 
9
the United States generally constitutes a serious, 
10
heightened threat to the safety of incarcerated indi-
11
viduals, and there is a serious threat to the general 
12
public that prisons may become incubators of com-
13
munity spread of communicable viral disease.
