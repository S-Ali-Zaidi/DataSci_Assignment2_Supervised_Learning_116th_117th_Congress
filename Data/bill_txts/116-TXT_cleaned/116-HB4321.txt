(2) to reorient the national approach to the 
1
presence of lead-based pipe and taps in public and 
2
private homes to implement, on a priority basis, a 
3
program to evaluate and reduce lead-based pipe haz-
4
ards in the Nation’s building stock; 
5
(3) to encourage effective action to prevent 
6
childhood lead poisoning by establishing a workable 
7
framework for lead-based pipe and tap hazard eval-
8
uation and reduction and by ending the current con-
9
fusion over reasonable standards of care; 
10
(4) to ensure and implement the definitions of 
11
lead hazards in section 1417 of the Safe Drinking 
12
Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300g–6) and ensure that the 
13
existence of lead-based pipe and taps hazards is 
14
taken into account in the development of Federal 
15
Government housing policies and in the sale, rental 
16
and renovation of homes, and apartments; 
17
(5) to mobilize national resources expeditiously, 
18
through a partnership among all levels of govern-
19
ment and the private sector, to develop the most 
20
promising, cost-effective methods for evaluating and 
21
reducing lead-based pipe and tap hazards;

(6) to reduce the threat of childhood lead poi-
23
soning in housing owned, assisted, or transferred by 
24
the Federal Government; and
