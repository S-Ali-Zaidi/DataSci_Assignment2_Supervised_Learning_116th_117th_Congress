tainability of robust rural broadband networks in high

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

Congress finds the following:

•HR 2929 IH
(1) Internet data demands are increasing, and 
1
video streaming services represent a significant por-
2
tion of the growth of internet traffic today. 
3
(2) Broadband network operators must invest 
4
in additional capacity to accommodate that data and 
5
other traffic generated by third-party online services 
6
leveraging underlying broadband networks. 
7
(3) These edge providers depend upon the avail-
8
ability of such robust underlying network capacity to 
9
deliver their services to users. 
10
(4) The costs associated with broadband infra-
11
structure upgrades are significant and growing to 
12
keep pace with the online services that depend on 
13
these underlying networks. 
14
(5) The challenges of investing in and maintain-
15
ing such robust network capacity are even greater in 
16
rural areas due to the significant distances over 
17
which networks must be built and operated and the 
18
limited densities of the rural communities to be 
19
served. 
20
(6) All persons and entities that utilize and le-
21
verage networks should share equitably in sup-
22
porting the availability and sustainability of rural 
23
broadband networks.
