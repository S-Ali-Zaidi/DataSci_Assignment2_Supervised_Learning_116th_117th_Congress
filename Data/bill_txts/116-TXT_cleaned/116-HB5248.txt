Congress finds the following:

•HR 5248 IH
(1) When the United States officially entered 
1
World War I in April 1917, the Armed Forces were 
2
still segregated, even though African-American sol-
3
diers had served and distinguished themselves in 
4
every war since the Revolutionary War. 
5
(2) The 15th New York National Guard Regi-
6
ment was mobilized in 1917 as the 369th Infantry 
7
Regiment and called into Federal service on July 25, 
8
1917. 
9
(3) The 369th completed its basic military 
10
practice training at Camp Whitman, New York. 
11
(4) To receive combat training, the 369th re-
12
ported on October 8, 1917, to Camp Wadsworth, 
13
South Carolina, where the 369th experienced many 
14
incidents of racial discrimination. 
15
(5) Because many White soldiers refused to 
16
perform combat duty with Black soldiers, members 
17
of the 369th were initially assigned manual labor 
18
tasks, such as loading and unloading supplies, and 
19
constructing roads and railroads. 
20
(6) To escape such prejudice, the Regiment 
21
shipped off to France in early 1918 and, on April 
22
8 of that year, was assigned to the French Army for 
23
the duration of American participation in the war.

(7) On September 25, 1918, the Fourth French 
1
Army went on the offensive in conjunction with the 
2
American drive in the Meuse-Argonne where the 
3
369th captured the important village of Sechault de-
4
spite sustaining severe losses. 
5
(8) The 369th was also present in the Cham-
6
pagne-Marne, Meuse-Argonne, Champagne 1918, 
7
and Alsace 1918 campaigns, and fought in the Bat-
8
tles of Belleau Wood and Chateau-Thierry. 
9
(9) On November 26, 1918, the 369th reached 
10
the banks of the Rhine River, the first Allied unit 
11
to do so. 
12
(10) The 369th was relieved of its assignment 
13
with the French 161st Division on December 12, 
14
1918, then returned to New York, and was demobi-
15
lized on February 28, 1919. 
16
(11) The 369th received a parade down 5th Av-
17
enue in New York on February 17, 1919, receiving 
18
applause and cheers from hundreds of thousands of 
19
onlookers. 
20
(12) For his courageous and patriotic service, 
21
Private Henry Johnson of the 369th received the 
22
French Croix de Guerre, with Palm, for extraor-
23
dinary valor, the first American to be awarded this 
24
honor. He also belatedly received a Purple Heart,

was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, and in 
1
2015 was awarded the Medal of Honor. 
2
(13) Over 170 individual members of the 369th 
3
received the Croix de Guerre, many, the Distin-
4
guished Service Cross, and the 369th was awarded 
5
a unit citation. 
6
(14) The 369th was dubbed the ‘‘Harlem 
7
Hellfighters’’ by German soldiers, who found the 
8
men to be incredibly determined and courageous in 
9
battle. 
10
(15) The 369th was one of the first regiments 
11
of African Americans to serve with the American 
12
Expeditionary Forces during World War I and one 
13
of the first units in the United States to have Black 
14
officers lead enlisted men. 
15
(16) Altogether, the 369th spent 191 days on 
16
the front line in World War I, more than any other 
17
American unit. 
18
(17) The 369th never lost a foot of ground or 
19
had a man taken prisoner, despite suffering greater 
20
losses than any other American regiment, with over 
21
1,500 casualties.
