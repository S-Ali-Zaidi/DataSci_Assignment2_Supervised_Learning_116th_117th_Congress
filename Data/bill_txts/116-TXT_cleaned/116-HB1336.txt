SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
1
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) On April 6, 2018, Attorney General Jeff 
3
Sessions announced that the Trump Administration 
4
would begin implementing a new zero tolerance pol-
5
icy for immigrants crossing the border into the 
6
United States illegally. 
7
(2) Between April 19 and May 31, 2018, 1,995 
8
children were separated by the Department of 
9
Homeland Security from their migrant parents at 
10
the border. 
11
(3) On May 8, 2018, the president of the Amer-
12
ican Academy of Pediatrics issued a statement op-
13
posing separation of children and parents at the bor-
14
der, explaining that ‘‘highly stressful experiences, 
15
like family separation, can cause irreparable harm, 
16
disrupting a child’s brain architecture and affecting 
17
his or her short- and long-term health. This type of 
18
prolonged exposure to serious stress—known as 
19
toxic stress—can carry lifelong consequences for 
20
children.’’. 
21
(4) On May 29, 2018, the president of the 
22
American Psychological Association issued a state-
23
ment regarding the ‘‘traumatic effects of separating 
24
immigrant families’’, explaining that ‘‘[t]he longer 
25
that children and parents are separated, the greater

the reported symptoms of anxiety and depression for 
1
the children. Negative outcomes for children include 
2
psychological distress, academic difficulties and dis-
3
ruptions in their development.’’. 
4
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
5
gress that the separation of children from migrating par-
6
ents, as is resulting from the Trump Administration’s im-
7
plementation of the zero tolerance immigration policy, is 
8
cruel, inhumane, and harmful to the mental health of sep-
9
arated children.
