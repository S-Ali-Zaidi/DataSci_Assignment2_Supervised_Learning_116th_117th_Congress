RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for addressing the Arab-Israeli conflict 
in a concurrent track with the Israeli-Palestinian peace 
process and commending Arab and Muslim-majority 
states that have improved bilateral relations with Israel. 
Whereas a lasting two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict is essential to achieving long-term peace and se-
curity in the Middle East; 
Whereas it is the long-standing policy of the United States 
that a peaceful resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian con-
flict will only come through direct negotiations between 
the Government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority; 
Whereas successive United States Presidential administra-
tions have pursued peace agreements between the parties

for over 30 years, including the 1982 Reagan Plan for 
Middle East Peace, the 1991 Madrid Peace Conference, 
the 1993 Oslo Accords, the 1995 Wye River Memo-
randum, the 2000 Camp David Summit, the 2000 Clin-
ton Parameters, the 2001 Sharm El-Sheikh Fact-Finding 
Committee Report, the 2003 Roadmap for Peace in the 
Middle East, the 2005 Agreement on Movement and Ac-
cess, the 2007 Annapolis Conference, and efforts to re-
start the peace process under the Obama Administration; 
Whereas these efforts to encourage direct and bilateral nego-
tiations between the two parties have presently been un-
successful at ending the Israeli-Palestinian conflict; 
Whereas the inability to achieve a two-state solution threat-
ens the State of Israel’s security and identity as the 
democratic homeland of the Jewish people; 
Whereas the inability to achieve a two-state solution impedes 
the well-being and self-determination of the Palestinian 
people; 
Whereas reports indicate that Arab and Muslim-majority 
states have taken steps to improve bilateral relations with 
the State of Israel and are seeking new ways to advance 
strategic cooperative initiatives; and 
Whereas recent strategic trends in the region suggest that an 
integrated regional approach, defined by concurrent bilat-
eral negotiations between the Government of Israel and 
the Palestinian Authority and conversations between the 
Government of Israel and regional Arab and Muslim-ma-
jority states, could result in new progress in the Israeli- 
Palestinian peace process: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
