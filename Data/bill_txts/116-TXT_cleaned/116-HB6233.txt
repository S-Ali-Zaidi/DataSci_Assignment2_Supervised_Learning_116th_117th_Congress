A BILL 
To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide 
a tax credit for taxpayers who remove lead-based hazards. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; PURPOSE. 
3
(a) SHORT TITLE.—This Act may be cited as the 
4
‘‘Home Lead Safety Tax Credit Act of 2020’’. 
5
(b) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that: 
6
(1) Lead is a metal that can produce a wide 
7
range of health effects in humans when ingested. 
8
Children are more vulnerable to lead poisoning than 
9
adults.

(2) Lead poisoning is a serious, entirely pre-
1
ventable threat to a child’s intelligence, behavior, 
2
and learning. In severe cases, lead poisoning can re-
3
sult in death. 
4
(3) According to the Department of Housing 
5
and Urban Development, approximately 22,000,000 
6
housing units nationwide have at least 1 lead paint 
7
hazard. 
8
(4) While appropriated Federal lead abatement 
9
programs, such as the Lead Hazard Control and 
10
Healthy Homes grant programs, have helped reduce 
11
childhood lead poisoning, funding constraints have 
12
limited their impact to only about 400,000 homes 
13
since 1993. 
14
(5) Childhood lead poisoning can be dramati-
15
cally reduced by the abatement or complete removal 
16
of all lead-based hazards. Empirical studies also 
17
have shown substantial reductions in lead poisoning 
18
when the affected properties have undergone ‘‘in-
19
terim control measures’’ that are less costly than 
20
abatement. 
21
(c) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this section is to en-
22
courage the safe removal of lead hazards from homes and 
23
thereby decrease the number of children who suffer re-

duced intelligence, learning difficulties, behavioral prob-
