CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 
Supporting efforts to enact a bold jobs and infrastructure 
package that benefits all Americans, not just billionaires. 
Whereas the Nation’s crumbling roads, bridges, and schools, 
unsafe drinking water facilities, and outdated energy sys-
tems are in need of major transformation, and a plan is 
needed to rebuild the Nation and create millions of good 
jobs; 
Whereas the Nation’s taxpayers should not subsidize billion-
aires and Wall Street banks that will profit from 
privatizing roads, bridges, drinking water and sanitation 
systems, and utilities; 
Whereas any investment in the Nation’s roads and bridges 
must support the repair and rehabilitation of existing as-
sets, improve resilience to more extreme weather, and 
support targeted expansions to reduce congestion, im-
prove air quality, and enable job growth; 
Whereas the Nation must ensure that every child who attends 
a public school has safe facilities that contribute to a 
high-quality education, and therefore the Nation must in-
vest to construct, renovate, repair, and modernize its 
schools; 
Whereas direct public investment in the United States public 
transportation network can meet the Nation’s infrastruc-
ture needs without selling off roads and bridges to pri-
vate investors and foreign entities; 
Whereas any clean water initiative must prioritize investment 
in communities most in need, ensure safe drinking water 
for millions of Americans, and protect the Nation’s riv-
ers, lakes, and oceans;

Whereas any public investment in high-speed internet facili-
ties must ensure that this increasingly essential resource 
is available to all Americans through direct funding, tax 
credits for low-income workers, and investments in 
broadband to promote economic development, public safe-
ty, and a vibrant quality of life; 
Whereas any investments made to update Federal Aviation 
Administration facilities and United States ports, water-
ways, dams, and levees should ensure that these entities 
remain public, improve security, and facilitate commerce; 
Whereas public investment to repair and upgrade the more 
than 1,800 Veterans Affairs facilities is critical to ensure 
that every veteran has access to quality institutions and 
state-of-the-art treatment; 
Whereas any investment plan should prioritize creating mil-
lions of living-wage jobs for struggling communities and 
especially for people of color, women, and individuals in 
high-poverty areas; 
Whereas any public investment in Federal funding to public 
lands should be directed through Federal land manage-
ment agencies that would strengthen the Nation’s out-
door industry and ensure that public lands are widely en-
joyed by Americans for generations to come and are not 
sold off to private entities or foreign governments; 
Whereas true public investment also includes investment in 
Tribal transportation, Indian Health Service facilities, 
and Bureau of Indian Education schools to promote job 
creation in Indian country where community members 
have had to make do with substandard services for gen-
erations;

Whereas public investment should aim to build resilient com-
munities and infrastructure protection to ensure that the 
Nation’s infrastructure can withstand cyber attacks, 
physical attacks, and the extreme weather events caused 
by climate change; 
Whereas a genuine infrastructure agenda should not sell or 
lease roads, water systems, or other essential infrastruc-
ture facilities, resulting in new tolls and user fees on 
working families; 
Whereas we cannot leave essential rural infrastructure in dis-
repair simply because it would not generate profits for 
private investors; 
Whereas public investment to repair and upgrade the Na-
tion’s public housing and assisted housing stock is critical 
to address the Nation’s dire rental and affordable hous-
ing crisis; 
Whereas government spending on infrastructure as a share of 
the economy has fallen to a 2-decade low, and yet for 
every $1 in government investment the Nation’s economy 
would gain $1.70 back through greater employment and 
efficiency; and 
Whereas in its 2017 Infrastructure Report Card, the Amer-
ican Society of Civil Engineers estimates approximately 
$4.6 trillion in infrastructure needs over 10 years, of 
which $2.06 trillion does not have funding: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate
