(2) Following the enactment of the No Child 
1
Left Behind Act of 2001, which amended the Ele-
2
mentary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, 
3
Federal education policy has placed an increased 
4
emphasis on testing assessments, requiring students 
5
to undergo standardized testing every year in grades 
6
3 through 8. 
7
(3) Reducing the frequency of federally required 
8
testing will allow more time for student learning and 
9
empower States and school districts to have more 
10
local control over the frequency of testing. 
11
(4) Students will have more time to receive one- 
12
on-one instruction and develop critical thinking and 
13
problem-solving skills through a well-rounded edu-
14
cation and curriculum. 
15
(5) Moving away from the Federal practice of 
16
annually ‘‘teaching to the test’’ will empower edu-
17
cators to provide instruction in a way that best in-
18
spires and prepares our country’s next generation of 
19
leaders. 
20
(6) With grade span testing, our educators will 
21
be more able to focus on those students who are 
22
most in need but who also lose the most class time 
23
preparing for annual tests.

(7) Grade span testing will allow States the 
1
flexibility to develop more meaningful, tailored as-
2
sessment systems that provide valid, reliable data.

(8) The yearly testing currently required by 
4
Federal law should be replaced with grade span test-
5
ing.
