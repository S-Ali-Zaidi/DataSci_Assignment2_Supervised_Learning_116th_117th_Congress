A BILL 
To prohibit unfair and deceptive advertising of rates for 
hotel rooms and other places of short-term lodging. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Hotel Advertising 
4
Transparency Act of 2019’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress makes the following findings: 
7
(1) As of the day before the date of the enact-
8
ment of this Act, hotel rooms and other places of 
9
lodging are often advertised at a rate and later in

the buying process mandatory fees are disclosed that 
1
were not included in the advertised room rate. 
2
(2) The mandatory fees described in paragraph 
3
(1) are sometimes called by names such as ‘‘resort 
4
fees’’, ‘‘cleaning fees’’, or ‘‘facility fees’’ and they are 
5
all mandatory and charged by a place of short-term 
6
lodging in addition to advertised room rates. 
7
(3) The number of short-term lodging facilities 
8
that charged mandatory resort fees is growing. 
9
(4) Advertising that does not reflect the true 
10
mandatory cost of a stay at a place of short-term 
11
lodging is deceptive. 
12
(5) The Federal Trade Commission has author-
13
ity under section 5 of the Federal Trade Commis-
14
sion Act (15 U.S.C. 45) to regulate and prohibit un-
15
fair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting 
16
commerce. 
17
(6) In 2012 and 2013, the Federal Trade Com-
18
mission exercised its authority under that section 5 
19
to issue warning letters to 35 hotel operators and 11 
20
online travel agents. In those letters, the Commis-
21
sion cautioned hotel operators and online travel 
22
agents that mandatory resort fees could confuse con-
23
sumers in violation of section 5(a)(2) of such Act 
24
(15 U.S.C. 45(a)(2)).

(7) In 2017, an economist at the Federal Trade 
1
Commission published an issue paper that found 
2
that forcing consumers to click through additional 
3
webpages to see a hotel’s resort fee increases the 
4
time spent searching and learning the hotel’s price, 
5
and went on to state the following: ‘‘Separating the 
6
room rate from the resort fee increases the cognitive 
7
costs of remembering the hotel’s price. When it be-
8
comes more costly to search and evaluate an addi-
9
tional hotel, a consumer’s choice is either to incur 
10
higher total search and cognitive costs or to make an 
11
incomplete, less informed decision that may result in 
12
a more costly room, or both.’’
