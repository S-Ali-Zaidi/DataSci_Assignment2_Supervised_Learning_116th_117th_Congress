ranks 36th in the world ‘‘in terms of access to water and 
sanitation,’’ and Americans can expect to ‘‘live shorter

Whereas poverty and inequality are not inevitabilities; 
Whereas poverty and inequality are choices made by people 
in power; 
Whereas every American has the right to just working condi-

food, and safe housing; 
Whereas the United States Government can and should be 
held accountable by Americans and the international 
community for ensuring these rights for all Americans; 
and 
Whereas to guarantee this accountability, the United States 
must ratify the International Covenant on Economic, So-
cial and Cultural Rights: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-
1
resentatives that the Senate should give its advice and

consent to the ratification of the United Nations Covenant

on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.
