•HR 3629 IH
(1) The February 2015 report of the Bureau of 
1
Consumer Financial Protection titled ‘‘Consumer 
2
Voices on Credit Reports and Scores’’ found that 
3
some consumers are reluctant to comparison shop 
4
for loans and other types of consumer credit prod-
5
ucts out of fear that they will lower their credit 
6
scores by doing so. 
7
(2) The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protec-
8
tion found that one of the most common barriers for 
9
people in reviewing their own credit reports and 
10
shopping for the best credit terms was a lack of un-
11
derstanding of the differences between ‘‘soft’’ and 
12
‘‘hard’’ inquiries and whether requesting a copy of 
13
their own report would adversely impact their credit 
14
standing. 
15
(3) The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protec-
16
tion revealed that consumers with accurate percep-
17
tions of their creditworthiness may be better 
18
equipped to shop for favorable credit terms.

‘‘(a) VALIDATED CREDIT SCORING MODELS.—Not 
2
later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this 
3
section, the Bureau shall issue final regulations applicable 
4
to any person that creates, maintains, or purchases credit 
5
scoring models used in making credit decisions to establish 
6
standards for validating the accuracy and predictive value 
7
of all such credit scoring models, both before release for 
8
initial use and at regular intervals thereafter, for as long 
9
as such credit scoring models are made available for pur-
10
chase or use by such person.

‘‘(b) PROHIBITION.—At least once every 2 years, the 
12
Bureau shall conduct a review of credit scoring models to 
13
determine whether the use of any particular factors, or 
14
the weight or consideration given to certain factors by 
15
credit scoring models, is inappropriate, including if such 
16
factors do not enhance or contribute to the accuracy and 
17
predictive value of the models. Upon the conclusion of its 
18
review, the Bureau may prohibit a person described in 
19
subsection (a) from weighing, considering, or including 
20
certain factors in, or making available for purchase or use,
