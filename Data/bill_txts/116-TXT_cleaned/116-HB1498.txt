A BILL 
To impose additional restrictions on tobacco flavors for use 
in e-cigarettes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Stopping Appealing 
4
Flavors in E-Cigarettes for Kids Act’’ or the ‘‘SAFE Kids 
5
Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
7
Congress finds as follows: 
8
(1) Tobacco use almost always begins during 
9
adolescence and, because nicotine is addictive, most

•HR 1498 IH
youth tobacco users continue to use tobacco as 
1
adults, even if they intended to quit. 
2
(2) According to the Surgeon General, ‘‘The 
3
use of products containing nicotine in any form 
4
among youth, including e-cigarettes, is unsafe’’ and 
5
‘‘Nicotine exposure during adolescence can cause ad-
6
diction and can harm the developing brain’’. 
7
(3) In 2018, youth e-cigarette use increased by 
8
78 percent among high school students and by 48 
9
percent among middle school students. More than 
10
3.6 million youth currently use e-cigarettes, an in-
11
crease of 1.5 million high school and middle school 
12
students in one year. 
13
(4) In 2018, 28 percent of high school e-ciga-
14
rette users and 16 percent of middle school e-ciga-
15
rette users reported frequent use of e-cigarettes, 
16
using e-cigarettes on at least 20 of the preceding 30 
17
days. 
18
(5) Rising youth use of e-cigarettes is hindering 
19
progress in reducing youth tobacco use. The use of 
20
any tobacco product increased by 38 percent among 
21
high school students and 29 percent among middle 
22
school students between 2017 and 2018.

(6) Both the Surgeon General and the Commis-
1
sioner of Food and Drugs have called the recent 
2
surge in youth e-cigarettes use an ‘‘epidemic’’. 
3
(7) The Surgeon General in 2018 issued an ad-
4
visory emphasizing the need to take immediate ac-
5
tion to stem the youth e-cigarette epidemic and to 
6
protect kids from a lifetime of nicotine addiction and 
7
related health risks. 
8
(8) Youth use of cigars is a public health con-
9
cern. High school boys smoke cigars at a higher rate 
10
than cigarettes (9 percent for cigars and 7.6 percent 
11
for cigarettes). 
12
(9) Flavors play a significant role in attracting 
13
kids to tobacco products and make them easier to 
14
use by masking the harshness of tobacco products. 
15
(10) A 2017 study identified more than 15,000 
16
unique e-cigarette flavors available online. E-ciga-
17
rettes come in flavors such as gummy bear, cotton 
18
candy, and fruit loops. 
19
(11) The number of unique cigar flavor names 
20
more than doubled, from 108 to 250, between 2008 
21
and 2015, and flavored cigars made up more than 
22
half of the convenience store cigar market in 2015. 
23
Cigars come in flavors such as chocolate, water-

melon, and tropical fusion and are sold in conven-
1
ience stores for as little as 3 for 99 cents. 
2
(12) Youth often begin tobacco use with a fla-
3
vored product. Eighty-one percent of youth who have 
4
ever used a tobacco product started with a flavored 
5
tobacco product. 
6
(13) Flavors are a primary reason why youth 
7
use e-cigarettes and cigars. Eighty-two percent of 
8
current youth e-cigarette users and 74 percent of 
9
current youth cigar smokers said they used these 
10
products ‘‘because they come in flavors I like’’. 
11
(14) In 2018, the Food and Drug Administra-
12
tion (FDA) and the Federal Trade Commission 
13
(FTC) took action against some deceptive e-liquid 
14
products that look like kid-friendly juice boxes, cook-
15
ies, and candy. Many similar products remain on the 
16
market. 
17
(15) The American Association of Poison Con-
18
trol Centers reported more than 3,100 calls in 2018 
19
due to exposure to e-liquids, and the American 
20
Academy of Pediatrics has warned about the dan-
21
gers of accidental poisonings because of the appeal 
22
of the packaging of flavored products. 
23
(16) Curbing the use of flavors in tobacco prod-
24
ucts will help to protect kids from nicotine addiction
