(a) IN GENERAL.—The United States Energy Stor-
4
age Competitiveness Act of 2007 (42 U.S.C. 17231) is 
5
amended by inserting after subsection (p) the following:

8
TION PROGRAM.— 
9
‘‘(1) DEFINITIONS.—In this subsection: 
10
‘‘(A) ELECTRIC
MOTOR
VEHICLE.—The 
11
term ‘electric motor vehicle’ means a vehicle 
12
that derives all or part of its power for loco-
13
motion from electricity and is able to exceed a 
14
maximum speed of 25 miles per hour without 
15
any external assistance, including gravity, as 
16
determined by the Secretary. 
17
‘‘(B) 
ELECTRONIC
SCRAP.—The 
term 
18
‘electronic scrap’ means personal electronic 
19
products near or at the end of their useful life, 
20
containing embedded energy storage systems, as 
21
determined by the Secretary. 
22
‘‘(C) ENERGY CRITICAL MATERIAL.—The 
23
term ‘energy critical material’ means any of a 
24
class of chemical materials that have a high 
25
risk of a supply disruption and are critical to

•HR 8232 IH
one or more existing or new, energy-related 
1
technologies such that a substantial supply dis-
2
ruption of such material would significantly in-
3
hibit large-scale deployment of technologies that 
4
produce, transmit, store, or conserve energy. 
5
‘‘(D) ENERGY
STORAGE
SYSTEM.—The 
6
term ‘energy storage system’ means a system, 
7
equipment, facility, or technology that— 
8
‘‘(i) is capable of absorbing energy, 
9
storing such energy for a period of time, 
10
and dispatching such energy after storage; 
11
and 
12
‘‘(ii) uses a mechanical, electrical, 
13
chemical, electrochemical, or thermal proc-
14
ess to store such energy, or any other proc-
15
ess that the Secretary determines relevant. 
16
‘‘(E) LOW-SPEED
ELECTRIC
VEHICLE.— 
17
The term ‘low-speed electric vehicle’ means a 
18
vehicle with fewer than four wheels that derives 
19
all or part of its power for locomotion from 
20
electricity and is unable to exceed a maximum 
21
speed of 25 miles per hour without any external 
22
assistance, including gravity, as determined by 
23
the Secretary.

‘‘(F) RECYCLING.—The term ‘recycling’ 
1
means the separation of energy critical mate-
2
rials embedded within an energy storage system 
3
through physical or chemical means and reuse 
4
of those separated energy critical materials in 
5
other technologies.

‘‘(2) ESTABLISHMENT.—Not later than one 
7
year after the date of enactment of this subsection, 
8
the Secretary shall establish a research, develop-

ONSTRATION.—In carrying out the program, the 
14
Secretary shall focus research, development, and 
15
demonstration activities on— 
16
‘‘(A) technologies, process improvements, 
17
design optimizations, and methods that improve 
18
collection, sorting, storage, and transportation 
19
of energy storage systems for the purposes of 
20
recycling, including— 
21
‘‘(i) removal of electronic scrap and 
22
low-speed electric vehicles from landfill and 
23
general recycling waste streams;
