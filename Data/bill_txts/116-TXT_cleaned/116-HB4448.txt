A BILL 
To address loopholes in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule 
of the United States that allow companies to avoid the 
duty rate applicable to dehydrated garlic. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Giving Agriculture Re-
4
lief from Loopholes in International Commerce Act’’ or 
5
the ‘‘GARLIC Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
7
Congress finds the following: 
8
(1) The United States domestic dried garlic in-
9
dustry currently provides approximately 50,000,000

pounds of dried garlic for the United States market 
1
and has the capacity to increase production. 
2
(2) Dried garlic imported from China accounts 
3
for approximately 140,000,000 pounds of the total 
4
amount sold in the United States market. 
5
(3) Dried garlic is classifiable under subheading 
6
0712.90.40 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of 
7
the United States, with a duty rate of 29.8 percent. 
8
(4) Chinese companies have found apparent 
9
loopholes in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule and are 
10
importing dehydrated garlic at much lower tariff 
11
rates, causing direct harm to the United States do-
12
mestic industry. 
13
(5) Imports of Chinese dehydrated garlic under 
14
the subheading for dried garlic, 0712.90.40, have 
15
decreased approximately 70 percent over the past 
16
few years, but there has not been a corresponding 
17
change in United States consumption or imports 
18
from other locations. 
19
(6) Importers of Chinese dried garlic are now 
20
engaging in limited further processing of the product 
21
and importing it as a ‘‘further processed vegetable’’ 
22
classifiable under subheading 2005.99.97, at a duty 
23
rate of 11.2 percent.

(7) Importers of Chinese dried garlic are also 
1
adding minimal amounts of other dehydrated vegeta-
2
bles, such as onion, to the dehydrated garlic and im-
3
porting it as ‘‘other mixed vegetables’’ classifiable 
4
under subheading 0712.90.85, at a duty rate of 8.3 
5
percent. 
6
(8) The dried garlic products imported from 
7
China 
under 
subheadings 
2005.99.97 
and 
8
0712.90.85 are still marketed and sold in the United 
9
States as dried garlic and directly compete against 
10
United States-produced dried garlic. 
11
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
12
It is the sense of Congress that— 
13
(1) the duty rate on dried garlic was set at 29.8 
14
percent to support United States domestic producers 
15
of dried garlic and create a more level playing field 
16
when competing against low-cost dried garlic im-
17
ported from China; 
18
(2) the use of these loopholes in the Har-
19
monized Tariff Schedule of the United States is di-
20
rectly harming United States domestic dried garlic 
21
producers, their employees, and the farmers that 
22
grow garlic in support of this domestic industry; and 
23
(3) the use of these loopholes in the Har-
24
monized Tariff Schedule of the United States has

(a) ADDITION OF U.S. NOTE.—The Additional U.S. 
6
Notes to chapter 7 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of 
7
the United States are amended by inserting in numerical 
8
sequence the following: 
9
‘‘6. In the assessment of duty on dried garlic, 
10
the presence of other vegetables mixed with the 
11
dried garlic shall not remove the product from sub-
12
heading 0712.90.40 unless the percentage of garlic, 
13
by weight, is less than 50 percent. 
14
‘‘7. In the assessment of duty on dried garlic, 
15
the application of additional heat to dried garlic does 
16
not constitute further processing such that the dried 
17
garlic 
would 
be 
excluded 
from 
subheading 
18
0712.90.40 unless the resulting dried garlic has an 
19
extractable color (optical index) of 1000+/¥500 as 
20
set forth under Section IV.C.5 of the American De-
21
hydrated Onion and Garlic Association (ADOGA)
