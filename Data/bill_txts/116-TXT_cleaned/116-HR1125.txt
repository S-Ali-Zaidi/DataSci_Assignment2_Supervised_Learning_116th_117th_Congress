Whereas American Indians and Alaska Natives are more than 
five times more likely to be hospitalized for COVID–19 
than White Americans; 
Whereas African Americans and Hispanic or Latino Ameri-
cans are more than four and one-half times as likely to 
be hospitalized for COVID–19 than White Americans; 
Whereas Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders are 10

despite vaccination rates that are typically as high as 
those of other communities: Now, therefore, be it
