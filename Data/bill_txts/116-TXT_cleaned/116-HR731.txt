RESOLUTION 
Condemning the inflammatory and racially offensive state-
ment of the President of the United States suggesting 
falsely a moral equivalence between the domestic terrorist 
act of lynching and the constitutionally provided congres-
sional impeachment power. 
Whereas in February 2014, the military of the Russia Fed-
eration, without merit or cause, invaded the eastern part 
of the free and independent country of Ukraine, including 
the Donbass region and the Crimean Peninsula; 
Whereas the United States, a strategic ally of Ukraine, re-
acted swiftly to the Russian invasion, condemning the 
military action in strong and bipartisan fashion, and pro-
viding military, humanitarian, and non-military financial 
assistance to the determined but beleaguered nation of

Ukraine, which since 2014 has totaled approximately 
$1.5 billion; 
Whereas in September 2019, members of the House of Rep-
resentatives were alerted to a complaint filed by a whis-
tleblower within the Intelligence Community alleging that 
on a July 25, 2019, call with the President of Ukraine, 
the current President of the United States sought to 
withhold $391 million in foreign military aid to Ukraine 
unless and until it announced publicly that it was cur-
rently conducting corruption investigations against one of 
the American president’s political rivals; 
Whereas, on September 25, 2019, the White House released 
a Memorandum of Conversation in which the July 25, 
2019, telephone conversation between the presidents of 
the United States and of Ukraine was memorialized and 
which corroborated in all material respects the allegations 
of the whistleblower; 
Whereas the Memorandum of Conversation released by the 
White House confirms that the President of the United 
States engaged in behavior that undermines the integrity 
of American elections, demeans the dignity of the office 
of the President of the United States, and jeopardizes the 
security of the United States; 
Whereas, on September 24, 2019, the Speaker of the House 
announced that the House of Representatives would com-
mence an impeachment inquiry pursuant to its constitu-
tional authority under article I, section 2, clause 5 to de-
termine whether in connection with the July 25, 2019, 
telephone conversation with the President of Ukraine, the 
President of the United States has engaged in conduct 
constituting ‘‘Treason, Bribery, or other High Crimes or 
Misdemeanors’’ as specified in article II, section 4;

Whereas, on October 22, 2019, bemoaning his fate, but not 
regretting his conduct, the President of the United States 
tweeted that ‘‘All Republicans must remember what they 
are witnessing here—a lynching,’’ thus falsely drawing a 
moral equivalence between the exercise of the impeach-
ment power expressly and solely conferred on the House 
of Representatives by the Constitution and lynching, the 
most heinous act of domestic terrorism and symbolic of 
one of the darkest and most shameful periods in Amer-
ica’s past; 
Whereas the statement asserted in the President’s tweet is 
false, inflammatory, racially offensive, unbecoming the 
Nation’s Chief Magistrate but consistent with prior state-
ments the President has made to stoke to division, dis-
cord, and disharmony among the American people; 
Whereas the current President of the United States bur-
nished his political reputation by claiming falsely for 
more than 5 years that his predecessor was born in 
Kenya and not the United States and thus was an illegit-
imate President; 
Whereas the current President of the United States launched 
his 2016 campaign for the Presidency said of persons 
from Mexico seeking to immigrate to the United States: 
‘‘They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re 
rapists.’’; 
Whereas the current President of the United States claimed 
that a Hispanic Federal jurist could not preside over a 
court proceeding to which he was a defendant accused of 
civil fraud because ‘‘He’s a Mexican.’’; 
Whereas in January 2018 the current President of the 
United States is reported to have inquired of his advi-

sors: ‘‘Why are we having all these people from shithole 
countries come here?’’, referring to persons from coun-
tries in Africa, the Caribbean, and Central and South 
America; 
Whereas, on August 15, 2017, the current President of the 
United States said he regarded as some ‘‘very fine peo-
ple,’’ the neo-Nazis, White supremacists, and Ku Klux 
Klansmen who descended on the peaceful community of 
Charlottesville, Virginia, to advocate racism and were met 
by peaceful counter-protestors; 
Whereas in his continuous and determined effort to exacer-
bate ethnic tensions and racial divisions in the body poli-
tic, the current President of the United States is reveal-
ing himself to be an unwitting instrument of the plan 
hatched in Moscow by Russian Federation President 
Vladimir Putin to interfere in the 2016 presidential cam-
paign to help elect his preferred candidate and sow dis-
cord and division among the American people; and 
Whereas statements and actions of the current President of 
the United States demean the office he holds and falls 
short of the standard set by the 16th President, whose 
administration was devoted to unity, healing, and ending 
racial division and who famously foretold in his March 4, 
1861, Inaugural Address the reasons why the efforts of 
the current President of the United States are destined 
to fail: ‘‘We are not enemies, but friends. We must not 
be enemies. Though passion may have strained, it must 
not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of 
memory, stretching from every battlefield, and patriot 
grave, to every living heart and hearthstone, all over this 
broad land, will swell when again touched, as surely they

stitution and lynching, the most heinous act of do-

(2) calls upon all Americans to read, celebrate,

and revere the Constitution of the United States, fi-

delity to which is the surest best means of forming

a more perfect union, establishing justice, ensuring
