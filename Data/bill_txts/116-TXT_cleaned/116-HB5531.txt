•HR 5531 IH
(1) Cities, towns, and rural communities in the 
1
United States continue to face enormous challenges 
2
regarding domestic violence, sexual assault, dating 
3
violence, stalking, and other forms of intimate part-
4
ner violence. 
5
(2) One in 3 women have experienced rape, 
6
physical violence, or stalking by an intimate partner 
7
in their lifetime. 
8
(3) Approximately 7,000,000 women are raped 
9
or physically assaulted by a current or former inti-
10
mate partner each year. 
11
(4) Each day, an average of 3 women are killed 
12
by a current or former partner. 
13
(5) Researchers estimate that domestic violence 
14
costs employers up to $13,000,000,000 each year. 
15
(6) A fundamental component of ending domes-
16
tic and sexual violence is securing safe and afford-
17
able housing for victims. 
18
(7) Research indicates that— 
19
(A) nearly 50 percent of all homeless 
20
women report that domestic violence was the 
21
immediate cause of their homelessness; 
22
(B) 92 percent of homeless women report 
23
having experienced severe physical or sexual vi-
24
olence at some point in their lives; 
25

•HR 5531 IH
(C) victims become homeless as a result of 
1
sexual assault, and once homeless, are vulner-
2
able to further sexual victimization and exploi-
3
tation; 
4
(D) women of color in the lowest income 
5
category experience 6 times the rate of nonfatal 
6
intimate partner violence compared to white 
7
women in the highest income category; 
8
(E) poor women of color, domestic violence 
9
victims, and women with children have a high 
10
risk of eviction; and 
11
(F) approximately 38 percent of all victims 
12
of domestic violence become homeless at some 
13
point in their life. 
14
(8) Surveys show that a majority of victims who 
15
experience a sexual assault in their home do not re-
16
locate to a safe environment because they do not 
17
have sufficient funds and are not aware of better op-
18
tions. 
19
(9) Domestic and sexual violence victims often 
20
find themselves trapped in homes where they are 
21
further victimized by caregivers, parents, siblings, 
22
landlords, intimate partners, neighbors, or others in 
23
or near their home. Economic insecurity and the 
24
trauma that often follows sexual assault make it dif-

ficult, if not impossible, for many victims to access 
1
safe, affordable housing options for themselves and 
2
their families. 
3
(10) Domestic and sexual violence victims con-
4
tinue to face discrimination in securing and main-
5
taining housing based on their status as victims and 
6
as a result of crimes committed against them. 
7
(11) Research by the Attorney General of the 
8
State of New York found that 67 percent of domes-
9
tic violence victims reported that discrimination by 
10
landlords is a significant obstacle in obtaining hous-
11
ing. 
12
(12) Research also shows that victims of domes-
13
tic violence or sexual assault are commonly denied 
14
housing opportunities if a previous residence of the 
15
victim was a domestic violence shelter, if the victim 
16
has secured a protective order, or if there is other 
17
evidence that the victim has experienced a previous 
18
domestic violence incident. 
19
(13) Studies show that victims of domestic vio-
20
lence or sexual assault often face eviction based on 
21
a single domestic violence incident. 
22
(14) It is in the public interest to ensure that 
23
victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, dating 
24
violence, stalking, and other forms of intimate part-

ner violence are not discriminated against, particu-
1
larly with respect to housing, based on their status 
2
as victims or the crimes committed against them. 
3
(15) Nothing in this Act should be interpreted 
4
to limit the ability of victims of domestic violence or 
5
sexual assault to recover for claims of discrimination 
6
on the basis of sex or race under the Fair Housing 
7
Act (42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq.), including with respect 
8
to failure to conform to gender stereotypes or poli-
9
cies that disproportionately affect women.
