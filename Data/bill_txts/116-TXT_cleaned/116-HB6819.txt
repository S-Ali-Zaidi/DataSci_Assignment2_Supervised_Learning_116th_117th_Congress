SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘COVID–19 Designa-
2
tion of Immediate Special Authority of Spectrum for 
3
Tribes’ Emergency Response in Indian Country Act’’ or 
4
the ‘‘COVID–19 DISASTER in Indian Country Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) The immediate grant of emergency special 
8
temporary authority of available spectrum that will 
9
efficiently support temporary wireless broadband 
10
networks and allow Indian Tribes to provide Tribal 
11
members with wireless broadband service over Tribal 
12
lands or Hawaiian Home Lands during the COVID– 
13
19 crisis due to the increased demand for tele-
14
communications and disproportionate impacts of the 
15
COVID–19 pandemic in Indian Country is essential. 
16
(2) Reservations are the most digitally discon-
17
nected areas in the United States that lack basic ac-
18
cess to broadband and wireless services at rates 
19
comparable to, and in some cases lower than, third- 
20
world countries. 
21
(3) In 2018, the Government Accountability Of-
22
fice and the Federal Communications Commission 
23
reported that only 65 percent of American Indian 
24
and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) living on Tribal lands 
25
had access to fixed broadband services, and only 68 
26

•HR 6819 IH
percent of AI/AN households on rural Tribal lands 
1
had telephone services. This is a stark comparison to 
2
only 8 percent of the national average that lacks ac-
3
cess to fixed broadband services. 
4
(4) Indian Tribes have previously encountered 
5
substantial barriers to accessing broadband and 
6
other communications services on Tribal lands to de-
7
ploy telecommunication services for the safety and 
8
well-being of Tribal members and to decrease the 
9
alarming rates of unnecessary loss of lives that AI/ 
10
ANs 
disproportionately 
experience, 
especially 
11
through the lack of access to health care services 
12
and emergency resources, as demonstrated during 
13
the COVID–19 pandemic that continues to dis-
14
proportionately impact Indian Country. 
15
(5) Indian Tribes’ lack of access to broadband 
16
services on Tribal lands and Hawaiian Home Lands 
17
during the COVID–19 pandemic further highlights 
18
the digital divide in Indian Country. 
19
(6) The Government Accountability Office 
20
found that health information technology systems at 
21
the Indian Health Service rank as the Federal Gov-
22
ernment’s third-highest need for agency system mod-
23
ernization, since 50 percent of Indian Health Service 
24
facilities depend on outdated circuit connections 
25

•HR 6819 IH
based on one or two TI circuit lines (3 Mbps), cre-
1
ating slower response times than any other health 
2
facility system in the United States. 
3
(7) A 2018 Tribal health reform comment filed 
4
with the Federal Communications Commission has 
5
further stated that approximately 1.5 million people 
6
living on Tribal lands lack access to broadband and, 
7
of the 75 percent of rural Indian Health Service fa-
8
cilities, many still lack reliable broadband networks 
9
for American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) 
10
to access telehealth or clinical health care services, 
11
which is a critical need in the most geographically 
12
isolated areas of the country with some of the high-
13
est poverty rates, and lack of access to reliable 
14
transportation. 
15
(8) The Bureau of Indian Education has stated 
16
that recent estimates from 142 out of 174 schools 
17
have indicated that approximately 15 to 95 percent 
18
of students do not have access to internet services 
19
at home depending on Bureau school location and 
20
limitations on data caps during the COVID–19 cri-
21
sis.
