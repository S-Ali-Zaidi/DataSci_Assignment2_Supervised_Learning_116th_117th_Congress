RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the United States should formally withdraw from the 
Paris Agreement. 
Whereas, on June 1, 2017, President Trump announced that 
the United States would cease all implementation of the 
Paris Agreement; 
Whereas, on August 4, 2017, the Department of State noti-
fied the United Nations Secretary General that the 
United States would provide formal notification of with-
drawal ‘‘as soon as it is eligible to do so’’; 
Whereas the agreement entered into force on November 4, 
2016;

•HRES 676 IH 
Whereas according to article 28 of the Paris Agreement, the 
period of eligibility for the United States to begin the for-
mal withdrawal process begins November 4, 2019, three 
years from the date on which the agreement has entered 
into force; 
Whereas withdrawal may take effect one year later, on or 
after November 4, 2020, and in the meantime, the 
United States will remain a Party to the Paris Agree-
ment, unless, following customary international law, the 
other Parties agree to allow an earlier exit; 
Whereas President Obama unilaterally accepted the Paris 
Agreement in August 2016 under the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change, rather than 
ratifying it as a treaty with the advice and consent of the 
Senate, a requirement stated in article II, section 2 of 
the Constitution; 
Whereas in addition to entering into the Agreement without 
congressional approval, burdensome regulatory measures 
have put the United States at a competitive disadvan-
tage, costing American jobs and increasing energy costs 
for consumers and taxpayers; 
Whereas according to one report, implementing policies to 
comply with the Paris Agreement would have increased 
electricity costs for a family of 4 between 13 and 20 per-
cent annually; 
Whereas a cost-benefit analysis was not conducted at the 
time of commitments, and subsequent reports have found 
that meeting the commitments agreed to could cost the 
United States GDP $250,000,000,000 and 2,700,000 
jobs by 2025;

•HRES 676 IH 
Whereas all 28 European Union countries are falling short of 
their commitments under the Paris Agreement, and 
meanwhile, the world’s worst emitters, China, Russia, 
and India, are exempted from its requirements; 
Whereas according to the International Energy Agency, the 
United States has seen the largest absolute decline in 
emissions among all countries since 2000; 
Whereas a recent study showed that the Paris Agreement will 
not have any meaningful impact on climate change, re-
ducing global average temperatures by just 0.086° F in 
2100; 
Whereas the United States is pioneering environmental pro-
tection without international interference, is a world lead-
er at reducing pollutants known to cause immediate harm 
to humans, and is ranked number one in the world for 
clean water, according to the World Health Organiza-
tion’s airborne particulate matter standards and the En-
vironmental Protection Agency; and 
Whereas instead of binding the United States to international 
agreements that put Americans at a national security 
and economic disadvantage to our competitors abroad, we 
should be focused on continuing to reduce emissions, de-
veloping and exporting clean energy technologies, and 
making our communities more resilient, all while ensur-
ing affordable, reliable energy prices and prioritizing the 
consumer, American security, and prosperity: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the United States should formally sub-
1
mit its notification to withdraw from the Paris Agreement.
