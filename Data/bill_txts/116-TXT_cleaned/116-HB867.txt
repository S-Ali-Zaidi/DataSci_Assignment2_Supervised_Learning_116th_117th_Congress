paragraph (4) of which requires Executive Branch 
6
appointees to contractually commit to the following: 
7
‘‘I will not, at any time after the termination of my 
8
employment in the United States Government, en-
9
gage in any activity on behalf of any foreign govern-
10
ment or foreign political party which, were it under-
11

12
register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act 
13
of 1938, as amended.’’.

15
