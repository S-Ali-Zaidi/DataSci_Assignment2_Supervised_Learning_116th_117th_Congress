RESOLUTION 
Condemning and censuring President Donald Trump. 
Whereas since its founding, our Nation has recognized the 
strength in diversity by making our national motto E 
Pluribus Unum; 
Whereas we continue to strive to live up to our national val-
ues equality, opportunity, and pluralism as we continu-
ously strive to create a more perfect union; 
Whereas President Donald Trump has continually maligned 
and scapegoated immigrants, people of color, and reli-
gious minorities, and attempted to use race and national 
origin to degrade people of color and delegitimize public 
officials; 
Whereas President Donald Trump has a long history of mak-
ing repugnant statements, including stating that ‘‘both

sides’’ were to blame for the violence in Charlottesville, 
Virginia, attempting to create a moral equivalency be-
tween White supremacists, the KKK, neo-Nazi groups, 
and those counter-protesting the ‘‘Unite the Right’’ rally, 
and referring to African nations as ‘‘shithole countries’’ 
or ‘‘shithouse countries’’; 
Whereas the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) 
has planned to intimate domestic immigration raids, tar-
geting thousands of migrant families; 
Whereas to sow widespread fear, on June 19, 2019, Presi-
dent Donald Trump tweeted ‘‘Next week ICE will begin 
the process of removing the millions of illegal aliens who 
have illicitly found their way into the United States.’’; 
Whereas on July 14, when ICE was expected to initiate co-
ordinated immigration raids across the United States, 
President Donald Trump tweeted ‘‘So interesting to see 
‘Progressive’ Democrat Congresswomen, who originally 
came from countries whose governments are a complete 
and total catastrophe, the worst, most corrupt and inept 
anywhere in the world (if they even have a functioning 
government at all), now loudly . . . and viciously telling 
the people of the United States, the greatest and most 
powerful Nation on earth, how our Government is to be 
run. Why don’t they go back and help fix the totally bro-
ken and crime infested places from which they came. 
Then come back and show us how . . . it is done. These 
places need your help badly, you can’t leave fast enough. 
I’m sure that Nancy Pelosi would be very happy to quick-
ly work out free travel arrangements!’’; 
Whereas President Donald Trump was referring to Rep-
resentatives Alexandra Ocasio Cortez, Ilhan Omar, 
Ayanna Pressley, and Rashida Tlaib, who are all United

States citizens and duly elected members of the House of 
Representatives; 
Whereas these comments were widely criticized as racist and 
designed to promote a White nationalist view of the 
United States where immigrants and people of color 
should be expelled; 
Whereas on July 15, President Donald Trump was asked if 
‘‘it concerned you that many people saw that tweet as 
racist and that White nationalists are finding common 
cause with you on that point?’’, and responded by stating 
that ‘‘It doesn’t concern me because many people agree 
with me and all I’m saying is if they want to leave, they 
can leave’’; and 
Whereas in response to the criticism and outrage about his 
comments, President Donald Trump sought to further di-
vide the Nation: Now, therefore, be it
