SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
5
Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) The future strength of the Nation’s democ-
7
racy, as well as the Nation’s economy, is dependent 
8
upon the investments made in children and youth 
9
today. 
10
(2) Evidence demonstrates that effective part-
11
nerships among schools and communities increase 
12
student achievement by addressing the academic 
13
needs of students as well as the challenges the stu-
14
dents face outside the classroom. For example: 
15
(A) Chicago Public Schools leads one of 
16
the Nation’s largest community school initia-
17
tives and found that students in grades 9 to 12 
18
who attend a community school have 61 percent 
19
21:10 Mar 10, 2020
H6106
3 
•HR 6106 IH
fewer school-day absences than their non-com-
1
munity school counterparts. When compared to 
2
non-community school counterparts, students in 
3
grades 9 to 12 were found to have more positive 
4
educational experiences; students in grades 4 to 
5
8 had higher Emotional Health scores on the 
6
survey; and students in grades K to 3 had 53 
7
percent fewer suspensions and 55 percent fewer 
8
misconducts. 
9
(B) In a 7-year study of 200 Chicago pub-
10
lic schools, sociologist Anthony Bryk found that 
11
in schools where grassroots organizations forge 
12
strong connections with their schools, trust lev-
13
els and parent involvement are greater. 
14
(C) United Way of Salt Lake’s Promise 
15
Partnership, an initiative across multiple school 
16
districts in the Salt Lake, Utah area, has 
17
helped increase student achievement and grad-
18
uation rates. At one of United Way’s partner 
19
schools, Granite Park Junior High, the percent-
20
age of students completing 9th grade and on 
21
track to graduate has more than doubled in 2 
22
years. Their efforts also have increased pre-
23
school opportunities in their poorest neighbor-
24
hoods so that 1,000 additional low-income stu-
25

dents attend high-quality preschool. Third 
1
grade reading proficiency scores rose 15.5 per-
2
cent from 2013–2014, and chronic absence de-
3
creased from 21 percent to 14 percent from 
4
2013–2014. A Promise Partnership Regional 
5
Council, which was formed in 2014, includes 
6
education, business, government, and nonprofit 
7
leaders, guides the initiative and focuses on 
8
keeping the work aligned. 
9
(D) In Wisconsin, where formal partner-
10
ships with community agencies are required for 
11
grant programs, non-traditional partners have 
12
proven to be instrumental for smaller commu-
13
nities to enrich after school programs. Those 
14
partners have included local trucking compa-
15
nies, statewide nonprofit organizations like the 
16
Grange, Farm Bureau, small retailers, and re-
17
tirees. 
18
(E) Union City Public Schools (New Jer-
19
sey) school district proves that by breaking 
20
down institutional ‘‘silos’’ and creating deep 
21
partnerships, through collaboration and munic-
22
ipal involvement, schools can be vibrant places 
23
of hope despite poverty, unemployment, and 
24
lack of affordable housing.

(F) Social Justice Humanitas Academy in 
1
Los Angeles, California, enrolls approximately 
2
500 students with 88 percent eligible for free or 
3
reduced school lunch. Students are supported 
4
by 
Individualized 
Pupil 
Education 
Plans 
5
(IPEP) that determine how teachers and part-
6
ners involved in the Community School can best 
7
help struggling students and reflect the close 
8
relationships between students and teachers. At 
9
the conclusion of the 2013–2014 school year, 
10
the graduation rate rose from 83 percent to 
11
93.9 percent, and 99 percent of those graduates 
12
enrolled in college. The suspension rate was 
13
0.02 percent, compared to 1.02 percent across 
14
the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
15
(G) By meeting the comprehensive needs 
16
of students, Communities In Schools, a national 
17
dropout prevention organization, found that 99 
18
percent of participating students stayed in 
19
school, 78 percent of participating students met 
20
or made progress toward their attendance goals, 
21
90 percent met or made progress toward their 
22
behavior goals, and 88 percent met or made 
23
progress toward their academic improvement 
24
goals.

(3) In adopting the Every Student Succeeds 
1
Act (Public Law 114–95), Congress recognized com-
2
munity schools as a strategy to significantly improve 
3
the coordination and integration, accessibility, and 
4
effectiveness of services for children and families, 
5
particularly for children attending high-poverty 
6
schools, including high-poverty rural schools. 
7
(4) Approximately 84 percent of 9th graders 
8
graduate from high school within 4 years. Of stu-
9
dents who graduate from high school, 69 percent en-
10
roll in a 2- or 4-year college in the fall after com-
11
pleting high school. Only about half (58 percent) of 
12
first-time, full-time college freshmen seeking a 4- 
13
year degree receive a bachelor’s degree within 6 
14
years or less. 
15
(5) Over the past 4 decades, the United States 
16
has slipped from being first in the world in high 
17
school and college graduation rates to 21st and 
18
14th, respectively, putting the Nation at a growing 
19
competitive disadvantage with other countries. 
20
(6) In a study conducted by Hanover Research, 
21
data showed that quality partnerships between 
22
schools and their communities can result in im-
23
proved attendance, motivation, conduct, and aca-
24
demic achievement. Community-level strategies like 
25

•HR 6106 IH
focusing on parental involvement, community build-
1
ing, and cultural competence were shown to con-
2
tribute to decreases in the achievement gap between 
3
lower- and upper-income students. 
4
(7) Research from the Government Account-
5
ability Office found that students who change 
6
schools less frequently are more likely to perform at 
7
grade level and less likely to repeat a grade than 
8
their less stable peers. 
9
(8) In research studies in psychology, health, 
10
and education by Teachers College, Columbia Uni-
11
versity, school ‘‘connectedness’’ is identified as im-
12
portant to student learning, achievement, and well- 
13
being. When students feel a sense of connection with 
14
the larger world and community institutions, they 
15
are more engaged in instructional activities and ex-
16
press greater commitment to school. 
17
(9) It has been learned from successful experi-
18
ences that hundreds of thousands of arts, cultural, 
19
service, sports, colleges and other youth organiza-
20
tions, as well as civic and faith-based groups want 
21
to partner with schools and educators to reinforce 
22
learning, but far too often, neither the school nor 
23
the community know how to effectively connect with 
24
each other.

(10) In order for the United States to compete 
1
in a global economy, the co-partnering efforts of gov-
2
ernment, social services, business, arts, home, com-
3
munity-based organizations, and philanthropy need 
4
to concentrate their efforts where they are most 
5
needed: in our schools. 
6
(11) Research from Johns Hopkins University 
7
has shown that access to summer learning opportu-
8
nities leads to significant student learning gains not 
9
experienced by students who cannot access summer 
10
learning opportunities. 
11
(12) A 2011 study conducted by the RAND 
12
Corporation found that students who attend summer 
13
learning programs, particularly those featuring indi-
14
vidualized instruction, parental involvement, and 
15
small class sizes, experience clear benefits in over-
16
coming the achievement gap between low- and 
17
upper-income students. 
18
(13) Research from the Community School 
19
Partnership finds that community schools see a re-
20

21
