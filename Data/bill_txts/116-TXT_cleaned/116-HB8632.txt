8
storage, lasting an equivalent time period as the 
9
carbon storage lost by the adverse impact;

11
best available science, that the carbon storage 
12
offset will result in a net increase in ecological

carbon storage and is located in close proximity

seafood can be a sustainable healthy source of pro-

(4) fresh, frozen, dried, and canned domestic 
22
seafood can be produced, processed, and transported

in a manner that has a low carbon footprint;

(6) therefore, any executive agency that pur-
4
chases seafood products should, to the extent prac-

speed is confirmed by the pilot on board or, when a

sel. If a deviation from the applicable speed limit is

CARBON EMISSIONS TO 33 PERCENT BELOW

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that— 
24
19:26 Nov 17, 2020
H8632
169 
•HR 8632 IH
(1) black carbon is a highly potent greenhouse 
1
gas that is likely responsible for about a quarter of 
2
the warming the Arctic has experienced over the last 
3
century; 
4
(2) black carbon particles have a short lifecycle 
5
in the atmosphere but trap heat far more powerfully 
6
than carbon dioxide; and 
7
(3) when black carbon falls on land and sea ice, 
8
it darkens surfaces and thus absorbs more heat, 
9
causing ice to melt at a faster rate. 
10
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
11
gress that the United States should honor its commitment 
12
to the Arctic Council to cut black carbon emissions by 
13
2025 to a level that is between 25 and 33 percent below 
14
the levels emitted by the United States in 2013. 
15
(c) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 180 days after the 
16
date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State, 
17
in consultation with the Secretary of Transportation, the 
18
Administrator, and the Administrator of the Environ-

SEC. 1201. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS; PURPOSES. 
7
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following find-
8
ings: 
9
(1) The ocean and coastal waters of the United 
10
States are foundational to the economy, security, 
11
global competitiveness, and well-being of the United 
12
States and continuously serve the people of the 
13
United States and other countries as an important 
14
source of food, energy, economic productivity, recre-
15
ation, culture, beauty, and enjoyment. 
16
(2) Over many years, the resource productivity 
17
and water quality of the ocean and coastal areas of 
18
the United States have been diminished by pollution, 
19
increasing population demands, economic develop-
20
ment, and natural and man-made hazard events, 
21
both acute and chronic. 
22
(3) Ocean and coastal areas of the United 
23
States are managed by State and Federal resource 
24
agencies and regulated on an interstate and regional

scale by various overlapping Federal authorities, 
1
thereby creating a significant need for interstate co-
2
ordination to enhance regional priorities, including 
3
the ecological and economic health of those areas. 
4
(4) Regional Ocean Partnerships, established by 
5
coastal states working in close coordination with 
6
Federal agencies, regional fisheries managers, and 
7
Tribal governments, help coordinate interstate re-
8
sponses to critical ocean issues that extend beyond 
9
individual State boundaries. 
10
(5) Regional Ocean Partnerships have improved 
11
understanding of climate change’s impact on fish 
12
and shellfish populations, have invested in identi-
13
fying indicators of ocean health and addressing 
14
coastal mitigation, and have played leading roles in 
15
the creation and upkeep of regional ocean data por-
16
tals that allow for improved understanding of ocean 
17
use synergies and trade-offs. 
18
(6) Regional Ocean Partnerships engage in co-
19
ordinated efforts to protect and enhance the health 
20
of living resources and engage the public in steward-
21
ship of ocean and coastal areas. 
22
(7) The coordination offered by Regional Ocean 
23
Partnerships is particularly critical in the era of cli-
24
mate change, with coastal and ocean resources under

8
(2) To expand Federal support for monitoring, 
9
data management, and restoration activities in ocean 
10
and coastal areas. 
11
(3) To commit the United States to a com-
12
prehensive cooperative program to achieve improved 
13
water quality in, and improvements in the produc-
14
tivity of living resources of, all coastal ecosystems. 
15
(4) To authorize Regional Ocean Partnerships 
16
as intergovernmental coordinators for shared inter-
17
state and regional priorities relating to the collabo-
18
rative management of the large marine ecosystems, 
19
thereby reducing duplication of efforts and maxi-

(a) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds the following: 
3
(1) 49 marine mammal species are considered 
4
depleted under the Marine Mammal Protection Act 
5
of 1972, and of those species, 42 are listed as 
6
threatened or endangered under the Endangered 
7
Species Act of 1973. 
8
(2) Climate change is altering marine mammal 
9
migration routes and timing. 
10
(3) Hundreds of threatened and endangered 
11
marine mammals, including North Atlantic right 
12
whales and blue whales, die from vessel strikes each 
13
year. 
14
(4) Underwater noise generated by vessels has 
15
increased significantly since 1950, impeding for-
16
aging, breeding, communication, and other behaviors 
17
of marine animals, including of threatened species 
18
and endangered species. 
19
(5) Slower ship speeds reduce the lethality of 
20
vessel strikes on marine life, moderate underwater 
21
noise, and provide climate benefits through reduced 
22
fuel consumption and lower particulate emissions.
