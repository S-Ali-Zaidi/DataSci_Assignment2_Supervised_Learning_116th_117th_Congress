A BILL 
To amend the Public Health Service Act to clarify liability 
protections regarding emergency use of automated exter-
nal defibrillators. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Cardiac Arrest Sur-

Congress finds the following:

automated external defibrillators (in this section re-
1
ferred to as ‘‘AEDs’’) in perceived medical emer-
2
gencies, who own or hold other property interests in 
3
AEDs used in perceived medical emergencies, or who 
4
own, occupy, or manage premises in which an AED 
5
is used or from which an AED is taken for use in 
6
a perceived medical emergency will encourage the 
7
deployment of additional AEDs, which will ulti-
8
mately save lives that would otherwise have been lost 
9
to cardiac arrest. 
10
(2) The current patchwork of State ‘‘Good Sa-
11
maritan’’ laws provides incomplete, inconsistent, 
12
and, in some instances, inadequate protection for en-
13
tities considering the acquisition or deployment of 
14
AEDs. In these circumstances, concerns about po-
15
tential liability resulting from the good-faith acquisi-
16
tion and deployment of this life-saving technology 
17
are inhibiting its deployment. 
18
(3) Such concerns are especially acute for enti-
19
ties with operations or facilities in multiple States, 
20
yet such entities are also among those in which the 
21
widespread deployment of AEDs would be most ben-
22
eficial. 
23
(4) A nationally uniform baseline of protection 
24
from civil liability is needed for persons who use
