•HR 4209 IH
(1) Foreign adversaries of the United States 
1
are currently using malign influence to disrupt, 
2
alter, and undermine United States foreign and do-
3
mestic policy and democratic processes at low cost 
4
and low risk to themselves. 
5
(2) In exporting malign influence, foreign ad-
6
versaries use ambiguity to their advantage, employ-
7
ing proxies, hackers, private sector companies, 
8
‘‘independent’’ research agencies, and other actors 
9
with varying degrees of separation from their gov-
10
ernments in an effort to obscure foreign government 
11
involvement and maintain deniability. 
12
(3) Since the Cold War, the Soviet Union and 
13
now the Russian Federation (in this Act referred to 
14
as ‘‘Russia’’) has attempted to use these types of 
15
tools of statecraft to influence the foreign and do-
16
mestic policies and actions of the United States gov-
17
ernment, as well as the beliefs and political decisions 
18
of America and its citizens. 
19
(4) The United States intelligence community 
20
has credibly concluded that Russia interfered in the 
21
2016 election for President of the United States, 
22
and European allies and partners have credibly con-
23
cluded that Russia attempted to influence several 
24
key European votes in 2016 and 2017, including the

Brexit referendum in the United Kingdom and elec-
1
tions in the Netherlands, France, and Germany. 
2
(5) Russia has attempted to deter or derail as-
3
piring NATO members from achieving accession, as 
4
evidenced by their aggression against Ukraine and 
5
Georgia and the attempted violent coup in Monte-
6
negro in 2016 with the assistance of local Serbian 
7
nationalists. 
8
(6) Russia has leveraged its gas monopoly over 
9
Europe to influence politics and political decisions of 
10
our NATO allies and European Union partners, as 
11
it has done repeatedly in Ukraine and across East-
12
ern Europe. 
13
(7) Russia has attempted to finance fringe po-
14
litical movements in countries throughout Europe, 
15
using a network of oligarchs and organized criminal 
16
enterprises in an effort to obscure Kremlin involve-
17
ment. 
18
(8) Russia operates Russia Today (RT), Sput-
19
nik, and other state-sponsored media outlets in doz-
20
ens of languages across Europe and the United 
21
States to spread disinformation and undermine gov-
22
ernment and electoral systems. It also assaults

American institutions and those of our European al-

1
in the information space. 
2
(9) The United States national security appa-
3
ratus has credibly concluded that Russia continues 
4
to utilize malign influence to undermine our democ-
5
racies and will continue to do so for the foreseeable 
6
future. 
7
(10) Parts of the United States Government 
8
interagency response, such as the Global Engage-
9
ment Center (GEC), were empowered to address 
10
specific elements of Russian malign influence, par-
11
ticularly disinformation. 
12
(11) The mission of the GEC is ‘‘to direct, lead, 
13
synchronize, integrate, and coordinate efforts of the 
14
Federal Government to recognize, understand, ex-
15
pose, and counter foreign state and foreign non-state 
16
propaganda and disinformation efforts aimed at un-
17
dermining or influencing the policies, security, or 
18
stability of the United States and its allies and part-
19
ner nations’’. 
20
(12) The GEC plays an important role in coun-
21
tering the disinformation tactics used by foreign ad-
22
versaries and coordinating these responses across 
23
the United States Government.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
5
It is the sense of Congress that United States Gov-
6
ernment efforts to counter Russian malign influence 
7
should be led by the Department of State in close coordi-
8
nation with the Department of Defense, the intelligence 
9
community, and other relevant Federal departments and 
10
agencies and relevant private sector and civil society enti-
11
ties. 
12
SEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
13
It shall be the policy of the United States to— 
14
(1) continually seek to strengthen the United 
15
States defenses, and the defenses of its European al-
16
lies and partners, against malign Russian influence 
17
by closing off vulnerabilities that Russia can exploit, 
18
including by strengthening civil society, media lit-
19
eracy, and cyber defenses; 
20
(2) clearly state the costs that should be im-
21
posed on Russia for its attempts to utilize tools of 
22
malign influence against the United States and its 
23
European allies and partners;

(3) proactively mitigate Russian attempts to in-
1
fluence or interfere with the United States and its 
2
European allies and partners through deterrence, de-
3
nial, and resilience measures such that the damage 
4
inflicted upon the United States and its allies and 
5
partners when attacks do occur is reduced; and 
6
(4) promote stronger ties with democratic coun-
7
tries around the world, understanding that the best

defense against malign Russian influence is a strong

democracy and respect for individual liberty and the

rule of law.
