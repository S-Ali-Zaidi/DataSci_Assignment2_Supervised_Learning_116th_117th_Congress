A BILL 
To enact a comprehensive legislative response to the threats 
posed by the Chinese Communist Party to the United 
States of America and to freedom, democracy, and 
human rights around the world. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘China Task Force Act’’ 
2
or the ‘‘CTF Act’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is 
6
completely committed to a hostile communist ide-
7
ology in which individuals exist to serve the state, 
8
enjoying rights and freedoms only at the state’s dis-
9
cretion. 
10
(2) The CCP applies this ideology onto the Peo-
11
ple’s Republic of China (PRC) through a system of 
12
government called ‘‘socialism with Chinese charac-
13
teristics’’, the main tenet of which is the absolute to-
14
talitarianism of the CCP. CCP General Secretary Xi 
15
Jinping recently described this political system by 
16
writing ‘‘the Party, the government, the military, the 
17
people, and academia—east, west, south, north, and 
18
center—the Party leads everything’’. 
19
(3) The CCP’s adherence to communist ide-
20
ology and its application of this ideology through to-
21
talitarianism drives its persistently malign conduct 
22
as the CCP seeks to eliminate perceived threats to 
23
the security of its regime. 
24
(4) The CCP has legally defined the national 
25
security of the PRC as the ‘‘absence of international 
26
20:44 Oct 20, 2020

•HR 12 IH
or domestic threats to the state’s power’’, enshrining 
1
in law its belief that the CCP will not be secure until 
2
all threats foreign and domestic are eliminated, a 
3
concept which requires external aggression. 
4
(5) The CCP considers constitutional democ-
5
racy, internationally recognized human rights, free 
6
markets, independent journalism, and internal dis-
7
sent to be security threats. 
8
(6) It is a bedrock American principle that the 
9
United States Government is not built to grant 
10
rights, but to protect rights inalienable to every 
11
human being, and furthermore that the infringement 
12
of such rights anywhere is unjust. 
13
(7) Driven by its hostile communist ideology 
14
and enabled by decades of foreign policy from the 
15
United States and likeminded democracies which 
16
disregarded this ideology, the CCP has risen to be-
17
come the United States prevailing economic and na-
18
tional security threat of this generation. 
19
(8) The CCP’s malign conduct, its threat to 
20
American interests and values, and its fundamental 
21
illegitimacy as a means of governing one-fifth of 
22
mankind all ultimately derive from the CCP’s hostile 
23
communist ideology. As in the United States prior 
24
great power competition with a communist super-
25

•HR 12 IH
power, the United States goal should be the end of 
1
the CCP’s monopoly on power, rather than indefinite 
2
coexistence with a fundamentally hostile communist 
3
state. 
4
(9) The theory that unprincipled economic en-
5
tanglement with the PRC’s CCP-controlled economy 
6
would induce economic and political liberalization 
7
while contributing to United States interests has 
8
been proven false. Decisive action is required to stop 
9
the CCP from further exploiting the United States 
10
economy, defend United States national security in-
11
terests, impose costs on the CCP’s malign actions, 
12
and uphold American values.
