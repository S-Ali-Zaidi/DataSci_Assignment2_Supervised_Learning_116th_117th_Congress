SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
The Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Senior employees of major bank holding 
3
companies receive extraordinary pay packages, even 
4
when they oversee massive frauds and financial mis-
5
conduct. 
6
(2) Widespread financial misconduct by indi-
7
vidual Wall Street bankers led to the 2008 financial 
8
crisis, which caused the Great Recession. The De-
9
partment of Justice brought litigation against every 
10
major 
bank, 
resulting 
in 
more 
than 
11
$163,000,000,000 in fines. 
12
(3) This misconduct resulted from the actions 
13
of individuals and was a direct result of a banking 
14
culture that rewards bad behavior. 
15
(4) Despite the actions of individuals, Wall 
16
Street banks paid billions of dollars in fines out of 
17
monies that otherwise were owned and could be paid 
18
in dividends to shareholders. While culpable bankers 
19
continued to receive extraordinary pay, innocent 
20
shareholders paid the price for banker misconduct. 
21
(5) In the aftermath of the Great Recession, 
22
and after further misconduct in the financial serv-
23
ices industry, the Federal Reserve Bank of New 
24
York has urged financial firms to reevaluate and re-

form their compensation incentive structures to align 
1
with shareholders and customers interests. 
2
(6) Misaligned incentives within the banking in-
3
dustry continue to fail to hold Wall Street executives 
4
and their senior employees accountable for their ac-
5
tions.
