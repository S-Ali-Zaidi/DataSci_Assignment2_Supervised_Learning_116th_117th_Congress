SECTION 1. FINDINGS. 
3
Congress finds the following: 
4
(1) Communities of color, low-income commu-
5
nities, Tribal and indigenous communities, fossil

fuel-dependent communities, and other vulnerable

dren, and the elderly, are disproportionately bur-
1
dened by environmental hazards that include expo-
2
sure to polluted air, waterways, and landscapes. 
3
(2) Environmental justice disparities are also 
4
exhibited through a lack of equitable access to infor-
5
mation and data on potential exposure to environ-
6
mental hazards. 
7
(3) Communities experiencing environmental in-
8
justice have been subjected to systemic racial, social, 
9
and economic injustices and face a disproportionate 
10
burden of adverse human health or environmental 
11
effects, a higher risk of intentional, unconscious, and 
12
structural discrimination, and disproportionate en-
13
ergy burdens. 
14
(4) These disproportionate burdens are being 
15
exacerbated by the COVID–19 pandemic. 
16
(5) The Environmental Protection Agency has 
17
announced a nonenforcement policy under all envi-
18
ronmental laws during the COVID–19 pandemic for 
19
monitoring and recordkeeping requirements. 
20
(6) This policy is likely to increase the pollution 
21
burden in environmental justice communities and de-
22
crease access to monitoring data and information.

during this pandemic.
