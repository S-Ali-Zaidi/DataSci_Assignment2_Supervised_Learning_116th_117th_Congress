A BILL 
To direct the Comptroller General of the United States to 
conduct a study regarding women involuntarily separated 
or discharged from the Armed Forces due to pregnancy 
or parenthood, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. FINDINGS. 
3
Congress finds the following: 
4
(1) In June 1948, Congress enacted the Wom-
5
en’s Armed Services Integration Act of 1948, which 
6
formally authorized the appointment and enlistment

of women in the regular components of the Armed 
1
Forces. 
2
(2) With the expansion of the Armed Forces to 
3
include women, the possibility arose for the first 
4
time that members of the regular components of the 
5
Armed Forces could become pregnant. 
6
(3) The response to such possibilities and actu-
7
alities was Executive Order 10240, signed by Presi-
8
dent Harry S. Truman in 1951, which granted the 
9
Armed Forces the authority to involuntarily separate 
10
or discharge a woman if she became pregnant, gave 
11
birth to a child, or became a parent by adoption or 
12
a stepparent. 
13
(4) The Armed Forces responded to the Execu-
14
tive order by systematically discharging any woman 
15
in the Armed Forces who became pregnant, regard-
16
less of whether the pregnancy was planned, un-
17
planned, or the result of sexual abuse. 
18
(5) Although the Armed Forces were required 
19
to offer women who were involuntarily separated or 
20
discharged due to pregnancy the opportunity to re-
21
quest retention in the military, many such women 
22
were not offered such opportunity. 
23
(6) The Armed Forces did not provide required 
24
separation benefits, counseling, or assistance to the 
25

•HR 7383 IH
members of the Armed Forces who were separated 
1
or discharged due to pregnancy. 
2
(7) Thousands of members of the Armed 
3
Forces were involuntarily separated or discharged 
4
from the Armed Forces as a result of pregnancy. 
5
(8) There are reports that the practice of the 
6
Armed Forces to systematically separate or dis-
7
charge pregnant members caused some such mem-
8
bers to seek an unsafe or inaccessible abortion, 
9
which was not legal at the time, or to put their chil-
10
dren up for adoption, and that, in some cases, some 
11
women died by suicide following their involuntary 
12
separation or discharge from the Armed Forces. 
13
(9) Such involuntary separation or discharge 
14
from the Armed Forces on the basis of pregnancy 
15
was challenged in Federal district court by Steph-
16
anie Crawford in 1975, whose legal argument stated 
17
that this practice violated her constitutional right to 
18
due process of law. 
19
(10) The Court of Appeals for the Second Cir-
20
cuit ruled in Stephanie Crawford’s favor in 1976 
21
and found that Executive Order 10240 and any reg-
22
ulations relating to the Armed Forces that made 
23
separation or discharge mandatory due to pregnancy 
24
were unconstitutional.

•HR 7383 IH
(11) By 1976, all regulations that permitted in-
1
voluntary separation or discharge of a member of 
2
the Armed Forces because of pregnancy or any form 
3
of parenthood were rescinded. 
4
(12) Today, women comprise 17 percent of the 
5
Armed Forces, and many are parents, including 12 
6
percent of whom are single parents. 
7
(13) While military parents face many hard-
8
ships, today’s Armed Forces provides various lengths 
9
of paid family leave for mothers and fathers, for 
10
both birth and adoption of children.

SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
12
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
13
gress that women who served in the Armed Forces before 
14
February 23, 1976, should not have been involuntarily 
15
separated or discharged due to pregnancy or parenthood. 
16
(b) EXPRESSION OF REMORSE.—Congress hereby ex-
17
presses deep remorse for the women who patriotically 
18
served in the Armed Forces, but were forced, by official 
19
United States policy, to endure unnecessary and discrimi-
20
natory actions, including the violation of their constitu-
21
tional right to due process of law, simply because they be-
22
came pregnant or became a parent while a member of the 
23
Armed Forces.
