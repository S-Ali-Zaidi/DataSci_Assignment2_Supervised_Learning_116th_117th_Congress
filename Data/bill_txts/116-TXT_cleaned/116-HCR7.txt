CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of Congress that all direct and indirect 
subsidies that benefit the production or export of sugar 
by all major sugar-producing and -consuming countries 
should be eliminated. 
Whereas every major sugar-producing and sugar-consuming 
country in the world maintains some form of direct or in-
direct subsidy to support its sugar growers, processors, or 
consumers; 
Whereas virtually all of the more than 100 countries that 
produce sugar maintain market-distorting subsidy pro-
grams, including—

(1) the Government of Brazil which provides direct 
and indirect subsidies of at least $2,500,000,000 per year 
for programs to promote its sugar and ethanol industry 
and has increased subsidies in recent years in the form 
of preferential loans, debt forgiveness, and increased eth-
anol usage mandates; 
(2) the Government of India which provides at least 
$1,700,000,000 per year in subsidy supports to prop up 
its inefficient sugar industry, including WTO-illegal ex-
port subsidies in 2014, 2015, and 2018; 
(3) the Government of Thailand which has more 
than tripled its sugar exports since 2004 by providing at 
least $1,300,000,000 in subsidies and government pro-
grams to its sugar industry and by maintaining domestic 
prices well above export prices; 
(4) the Government of the European Union which is 
sending an estimated $665,000,000 per year in subsidies 
to sugar farmers; and 
(5) the Government of Mexico which has used direct 
and indirect subsidies to keep open sugar mills owned by 
private industry and the government has sent direct pay-
ments to sugarcane growers, and has been found guilty 
of injuring United States sugar producers by dumping 
subsidized sugar into the United States market; 
Whereas the world sugar market is the most volatile com-
modity market in the world; 
Whereas the foregoing clauses provide ample evidence there 
is no undistorted, free market in sugar in the world 
today; and 
Whereas if such a free market did exist, United States sugar 
farmers and processors could compete effectively in that 
market: Now, therefore, be it
