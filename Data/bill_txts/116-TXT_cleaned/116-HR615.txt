RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the designation of October 8, 2019, 
as ‘‘National Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Day’’. 
Whereas hydrogen, which has an atomic mass of 1.008, is the 
most abundant chemical substance in the universe; 
Whereas the United States is a world leader in the develop-
ment and deployment of fuel cell and hydrogen tech-
nologies; 
Whereas hydrogen fuel cells played an instrumental role in 
the United States space program, helping the United 
States achieve the mission of landing a man on the 
Moon;

Whereas private industry, Federal and State governments, 
national laboratories, and institutions of higher education 
continue to improve fuel cell and hydrogen technologies 
to address the most pressing energy, environmental, and 
economic issues of the United States; 
Whereas fuel cells utilizing hydrogen and hydrogen-rich fuels 
to generate electricity are clean, efficient, and resilient 
technologies being used for— 
(1) stationary and backup power generation; and 
(2) zero-emission transportation for light-duty vehi-
cles, industrial vehicles, delivery vans, buses, trucks, ma-
rine applications, and aerial vehicles; 
Whereas stationary fuel cells are being placed in service for 
continuous and backup power to provide business and en-
ergy consumers with reliable power in the event of grid 
outages; 
Whereas stationary fuel cells can help reduce water use, as 
compared to traditional power generation technologies; 
Whereas fuel cell electric vehicles that utilize hydrogen can 
completely replicate the experience of internal combustion 
vehicles, including comparable range and refueling times; 
Whereas hydrogen fuel cell industrial vehicles are being de-
ployed at logistical hubs and warehouses across the 
United States and exported to facilities in Europe and 
Asia; 
Whereas hydrogen is a nontoxic gas that can be derived from 
a variety of domestically available traditional and renew-
able resources, including solar, wind, biogas, and the 
abundant supply of natural gas in the United States;

•HRES 615 IH 
Whereas hydrogen and fuel cells can store energy to help en-
hance the grid and maximize opportunities to deploy re-
newable energy; 
Whereas the United States produces and uses approximately 
10,000,000 metric tons of hydrogen per year; 
Whereas engineers and safety code and standard profes-
sionals have developed consensus-based protocols for safe 
delivery, handling, and use of hydrogen; and 
Whereas October 8 would be an appropriate day to establish 
as ‘‘National Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Day’’: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives supports 
1
the designation of ‘‘National Hydrogen and Fuel Cell
