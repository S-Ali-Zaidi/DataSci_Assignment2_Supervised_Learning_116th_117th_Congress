RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
congressional redistricting should be reformed to remove 
political gerrymandering. 
Whereas political gerrymandering occurs when politicians 
draw their own congressional district lines to protect 
their self-interest at the expense of creating districts that 
reflect communities of interest; 
Whereas political gerrymandering can result in decreased 
electoral competition between congressional candidates, 
and in turn decreased responsiveness by Members of 
Congress to their voters’ interests; 
Whereas political gerrymandering can be used to split or pack 
certain demographic and political groups into congres-
sional districts in order to disproportionately diminish 
their representation in Congress;

ity for Congress to regulate elections and redistricting;
