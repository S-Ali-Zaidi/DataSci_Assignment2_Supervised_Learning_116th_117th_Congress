To improve the public health response to addressing maternal 
mortality and morbidity during the COVID–19 public 
health emergency. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Maternal Health Pan-

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds as follows: 
2
(1) The World Health Organization declared 
3
COVID–19 a ‘‘Public Health Emergency of Inter-
4
national Concern’’ on January 30, 2020. By the be-
5
ginning of August 2020, there have been over 
6
18,000,000 confirmed cases of, and over 700,000 
7
deaths associated with, COVID–19 worldwide. 
8
(2) In the United States, the number of cases 
9
of COVID–19 has quickly surpassed the number of 
10
such cases in every other nation, and as of August 
11
5, 2020, over 4,000,000 cases and 156,000 deaths 
12
have been reported by the United States alone. 
13
(3) Long-standing systemic health and social 
14
inequities have put communities of color at increased 
15
risk of contracting COVID–19 or experiencing se-
16
vere illness; age-adjusted hospitalization rates from 
17
COVID–19 are highest for American Indian and 
18
Alaska Native, Black, and Latinx people. 
19
(4) Prior to the start of the COVID–19 pan-
20
demic, the United States was facing a maternal mor-
21
tality and morbidity crisis, in which the United 
22
States has the highest maternal mortality rate in the 
23
developed world, and that rate is not improving. 
24
(5) More than 50,000 women in the United 
25
States annually experience severe maternal mor-
26
23:11 Aug 29, 2020
H8027

•HR 8027 IH
bidity, and much larger numbers experience more 
1
common harmful challenges, such as prenatal and 
2
postpartum anxiety and depression and lack of sup-
3
port for meeting breastfeeding goals. 
4
(6) Compared to White women, Black and 
5
American Indian and Alaska Native women in the 
6
United States are significantly more likely to die 
7
from pregnancy-related complications, and Black 
8
and American Indian and Alaska Native women suf-
9
fer disproportionately high rates of maternal mor-
10
bidity. 
11
(7) The causes of maternal mortality and mor-
12
bidity are complex and include racial, ethnic, and so-
13
cioeconomic inequities; racism, bias, and discrimina-
14
tion; comorbidities; and inadequate access to the 
15
health care system, including behavioral health care, 
16
which are factors that have similarly contributed to 
17
the racial disparities seen in COVID–19 outcomes. 
18
(8) The burden of morbidity and mortality in 
19
the United States for both COVID–19 and maternal 
20
health outcomes has also fallen disproportionately on 
21
Black, Latinx, and American Indian and Alaska Na-
22
tive communities, who suffer the most from great 
23
public health needs and are the most medically un-
24
derserved. 
25
23:11 Aug 29, 2020
H8027

•HR 8027 IH
(9) According to the Centers for Disease Con-
1
trol and Prevention, ‘‘pregnant people have changes 
2
in their bodies that may increase their risk of some 
3
infections’’ and ‘‘pregnant people have had a higher 
4
risk of severe illness when infected with viruses from 
5
the same family as COVID–19 and other viral res-
6
piratory infections, such as influenza’’. 
7
(10) As of June 25, 2020, the latest informa-
8
tion from the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
9
vention indicates that pregnant women are more 
10
likely to be hospitalized and are at higher risk for 
11
intensive care unit admissions than nonpregnant 
12
women due to COVID–19, and Latinx and Black 
13
pregnant people have been disproportionately in-
14
fected by COVID–19. 
15
(11) Our understanding of the specific impact 
16
of COVID–19 on pregnant people is limited, in part 
17
due to a lack of robust data collection, but the 
18
COVID–19 pandemic has further strained the health 
19
care system and added another layer of fear and vul-
20
nerability for pregnant people, with disproportionate 
21
effects on people of color. 
22
(12) As of July 30, 2020, over 14,000 pregnant 
23
people in the United States have tested positive for 
24
23:11 Aug 29, 2020
H8027
5 
•HR 8027 IH
COVID–19 and 35 pregnant people have died as re-
1
sult of COVID–19. 
2
(13) The World Health Organization states 
3
that everyone ‘‘has the right to safe and positive 
4
childbirth experience, whether or not they have a 
5
confirmed COVID–19 infection, this includes the 
6
right to respect and dignity, a companion of choice, 
7
clear communication by maternity staff, pain relief 
8
strategies, and mobility in labor when possible and 
9
the position of choice’’. 
10
(14) A COVID–19 public health response with-
11
out concerted Federal action and focus on maternal 
12
health care access and quality, research, data collec-
13
tion, mitigating negative socioeconomic consequences 
14
of the pandemic, and safeguarding the right to safe 
15
and positive childbirth experience will risk exacer-
16
bating the maternal mortality and morbidity crisis.
