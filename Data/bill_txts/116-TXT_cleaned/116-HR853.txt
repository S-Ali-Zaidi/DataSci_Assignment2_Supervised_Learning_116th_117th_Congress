RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the maternal health crisis in the United States 
and the importance of reducing mortality and morbidity 
among all women, and honoring mothers. 
Whereas the pregnancy-related mortality ratio, defined as the 
number of pregnancy-related deaths per 100,000 live 
births, more than doubled between 1987 and 2016; 
Whereas the United States is the only developed country 
whose maternal mortality rate has increased over the last 
several decades; 
Whereas of all pregnancy-related deaths between 2011 and 
2015— 
(1) nearly 31 percent occurred during pregnancy;

(2) about 36 percent occurred during childbirth or 
the week after childbirth; and 
(3) 33 percent occurred between 1 week and 1 year 
postpartum; 
Whereas more than 60 percent of maternal deaths in the 
United States are preventable; 
Whereas, in 2014 alone, 50,000 women suffered from a 
‘‘near miss’’ or severe maternal morbidity, which includes 
potentially life-threatening complications that arise from 
labor and childbirth; 
Whereas 28 percent of women who gave birth in a hospital 
in the United States reported experiencing 1 or more 
types of mistreatment, such as— 
(1) loss of autonomy; 
(2) being shouted at, scolded, or threatened; and 
(3) being ignored or refused or receiving no response 
to requests for help; 
Whereas certain social determinants of health, including bias 
and racism, have a negative impact on maternal health 
outcomes; 
Whereas significant disparities in maternal health exist, in-
cluding that— 
(1) Black women are more than 3 times as likely to 
die from a pregnancy-related cause as are White women; 
(2) American Indian and Alaska Native women are 
more than 2 times as likely to die from a pregnancy-re-
lated cause as are White women; 
(3) Black, American Indian, and Alaska Native 
women with at least some college education are more 
likely to die from a pregnancy-related cause than are

women of all other racial and ethnic backgrounds with 
less than a high school diploma; 
(4) Black, American Indian, and Alaska Native 
women are about 2 times as likely to suffer from severe 
maternal morbidity as are White women; 
(5) women who live in rural areas have a greater 
likelihood of severe maternal morbidity and mortality 
compared to women who live in urban areas; 
(6) nearly 50 percent of rural counties do not have 
a hospital with obstetric services; 
(7) counties with more Black and Hispanic residents 
and lower median incomes are less likely to have access 
to hospital obstetric services; 
(8) more than 50 percent of women who live in a 
rural area must travel more than 30 minutes to access 
hospital obstetric services, compared to 7 percent of 
women who live in urban areas; and 
(9) American Indian and Alaska Native women liv-
ing in rural communities are twice as likely as their 
White counterparts to report receiving late or no prenatal 
care; 
Whereas more than 40 States have designated committees to 
review maternal deaths; 
Whereas State and local maternal mortality review commit-
tees are positioned to comprehensively assess maternal 
deaths and identify opportunities for prevention; 
Whereas more than 25 States are participating in the Alli-
ance for Innovation on Maternal Health, which promotes 
consistent and safe maternity care to reduce maternal 
morbidity and mortality; 
Whereas community-based maternal health care models, in-
cluding midwifery childbirth services, doula support serv-

ices, community and perinatal health worker services, and 
group prenatal care, in collaboration with culturally com-
petent physician care, show great promise in improving 
maternal health outcomes and reducing disparities in ma-
ternal health outcomes; 
Whereas many organizations have implemented initiatives to 
educate patients and providers about— 
(1) all causes of, contributing factors to, and dis-
parities in maternal mortality; 
(2) the prevention of pregnancy-related deaths; and 
(3) the importance of listening to and empowering 
all women to report pregnancy-related medical issues; 
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (in 
this Resolution, referred to as the ‘‘CDC’’), for the first 
time in over a decade, released a report on January 30, 
2020, assessing the United States maternal mortality 
rate that— 
(1) found in 2018, the maternal mortality rate was 
17.4 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births; 
(2) found the maternal mortality rate for non-His-
panic Black women was more than double that of non- 
Hispanic White women at 37.1 deaths per 100,000 live 
births compared to 14.7, and 3 times the rate of His-
panic women (11.8); and 
(3) while using a new standardized methodology to 
improve the accuracy of States reporting maternal 
deaths, still has potential methodological concerns with 
the reporting of maternal mortality data, such as the 
CDC report excluding mothers over the age of 44 and 
only accounting for deaths within 42 days of giving birth, 
potentially omitting later postpartum deaths; and
