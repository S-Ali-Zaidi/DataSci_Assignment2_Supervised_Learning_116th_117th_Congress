RESOLUTION 
Congratulating the United States Women’s National Team 
for its win on July 7, 2019, of the 2019 Fe´de´ration 
Internationale de Football Association Women’s World 
Cup, and for becoming the most successful team in inter-
national women’s soccer. 
Whereas the United States Women’s National Team 
(USWNT) is the first team to win the Women’s World 
Cup 4 times and the second team to win back-to-back 
World Cup titles; 
Whereas the USWNT is ranked #1 by the Fe´de´ration Inter-
nationale de Football Association (FIFA);

Whereas, during the 2019 World Cup, the USWNT set the 
record for most goals scored in a single game, as well as 
most goals scored in the group stage, with 13 and 18 
goals, respectively, and also set a record for the most 
goals scored in a single World Cup, with 26 goals, and 
a record for wins at a Women’s World Cup with 7 wins; 
Whereas the team’s goal difference of +23 is the highest ever 
recorded by a country at a Women’s World Cup; 
Whereas USWNT players have won the Golden Ball at the 
Women’s World Cup 3 times, while no other country has 
won more than 1; 
Whereas Alex Morgan tied the record set by Michelle Akers 
in 1991 for goals in a match with 5 goals; 
Whereas Megan Rapinoe became the first player to score 
from a penalty kick in a Women’s World Cup final, and 
the first player to win the Golden Boot and the Golden 
Ball at a Women’s World Cup Final; 
Whereas Carli Lloyd set a record of scoring at least 1 goal 
in 6 consecutive Women’s World Cup matches, which 
scoring run started in 2015, and Coach Jill Ellis became 
the first coach to win the Women’s World Cup twice; 
Whereas the game against the Netherlands was the 50th 
game played by the USWNT at the World Cup—the 
most by any country—and the USWNT is also the first 
to play in 3 consecutive Women’s World Cup Finals; 
Whereas, as the USWNT continues to score big on the global 
stage, it continues to fight for equal treatment in the 
workplace at home, and, following a Federal wage com-
plaint with the United States Equal Employment Oppor-
tunity Commission in 2016, the members of the USWNT 
sued the United States Soccer Federation on March 28,

2019, for discrimination by paying the women’s national 
team less than the men’s national team for equal work 
and by denying them equal playing, training, and travel 
conditions, promotion of their games, support, and devel-
opment; 
Whereas the USWNT generates more revenue and attracts 
higher TV ratings than their male counterparts, but get 
paid less simply because they are women; 
Whereas women have been fighting for equal rights in sports 
since the enactment of title IX, the 1972 law that pro-
hibits discrimination based on sex in all federally funded 
education initiatives; 
Whereas the World Cup champions won America’s respect for 
their grit and determination on and off the field, and the 
USWNT members who inspire our country with their pa-
triotism, poise, tenacity, skill, and excellence every time 
they take the field deserve to be fairly compensated; and 
Whereas, despite FIFA’s efforts to increase the Women’s 
World Cup prize money from $15,000,000 in 2015 to 
$30,000,000 in 2019, the gap between men’s and wom-
en’s pay is still significant, as the 2018 men’s World Cup 
prize stood at $400,000,000: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives con-

gratulates the United States Women’s National Team for

its win on July 7, 2019, of the 2019 Fe´de´ration Inter-
