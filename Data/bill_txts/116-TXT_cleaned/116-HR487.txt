RESOLUTION 
Expressing full support to the Ukrainian people in their 
aspiration to continue consolidating their democracy and 
rule of law. 
Whereas the Ukrainian people have demonstrated their com-
mitment to democracy and sovereignty during the Revo-
lution of Dignity demonstrations as well as peacefully at 
the ballot box in three nationwide elections since then; 
Whereas the overwhelming majority of Ukrainians in all re-
gions say it is important that Ukraine continues to con-
solidate its democracy in the face of Russian-sponsored 
disinformation campaigns aimed at dividing the country 
as well as portraying Ukraine and its democratically 
elected leaders as a failed state; 
Whereas the results of the spring 2019 Ukrainian presi-
dential election indicate Ukrainians want to see progress

on reforms through processes that are both democratic 
and timely, particularly more accountable leadership and 
more consistent headway against public corruption; 
Whereas Ukrainian voters and election commissioners 
throughout the country conducted an orderly and demo-
cratic voting process, defying bomb threats, cybersecurity 
incursions, and predictions of disruption by extremist 
groups; 
Whereas Ukraine’s electoral systems stood the test of the 
presidential campaign, and the International Election Ob-
servation Mission organized by the Organization for Se-
curity and Cooperation in Europe found that the election 
was ‘‘competitive and held with respect for fundamental 
freedoms’’, 
but 
also 
highlighted 
potential 
future 
vulnerabilities and shortcomings in the electoral frame-
work; 
Whereas there may be attempts to exploit these shortcomings 
to discredit the snap parliamentary elections, currently 
scheduled for July, including as part of a Kremlin-orches-
trated disinformation campaign; 
Whereas Russian attempts to disrupt and discredit demo-
cratic electoral processes in Ukraine have direct and neg-
ative consequences for the American people, as Ukraine 
has served as a ‘‘testing ground’’ for Russian techniques 
later employed in the United States and Europe; 
Whereas a democratic electoral process, the results of which 
are seen as highly credible by all Ukrainians and the 
international community, will demonstrate the commit-
ment of the new Ukrainian administration to continuing 
or accelerating reform processes begun by its prede-
cessors; and
