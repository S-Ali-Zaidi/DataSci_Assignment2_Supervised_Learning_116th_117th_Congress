A BILL 
To ensure that Medicaid beneficiaries have the opportunity 
to receive care in a home and community-based setting. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Community Integra-
4
tion Act of 2020’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) The Supreme Court’s 1999 decision in 
8
Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), held that 
9
the unnecessary segregation of individuals with dis-
10

•HR 8934 IH
abilities is a violation of the Americans with Disabil-
1
ities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.). 
2
(2) Under Olmstead, individuals generally have 
3
the right to receive their supports and services in 
4
home and community-based settings, rather than in 
5
institutional settings, if they so choose. 
6
(3) Olmstead envisioned that States would pro-
7
vide appropriate long-term services and supports to 
8
individuals with disabilities through home and com-
9
munity-based services and end forced segregation in 
10
nursing homes and other institutions. 
11
(4) While there has been progress in rebal-
12
ancing State spending on individuals with disabilities 
13
in institutions as compared to home and community- 
14
based settings, more than 75 percent of States con-
15
tinue to spend the majority of their long-term care 
16
dollars on nursing homes and other institutional set-
17
tings, and the number of individuals with disabilities 
18
under age 65 in nursing homes increased between 
19
2008 and 2012. 
20
(5) As of June 2013, there were more than 
21
200,000 individuals younger than age 65 in nursing 
22
homes—almost 16 percent of the total nursing home 
23
population.

•HR 8934 IH
(6) Thirty-eight studies published from 2005 to 
1
2012 concluded that providing services in home and 
2
community-based settings is less costly than pro-
3
viding care in a nursing home or other institutional 
4
setting. 
5
(7) No clear or centralized reporting system ex-
6
ists to compare how effectively States are meeting 
7
the Olmstead mandate.
