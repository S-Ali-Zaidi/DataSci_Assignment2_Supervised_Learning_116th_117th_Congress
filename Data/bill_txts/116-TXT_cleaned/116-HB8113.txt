1
Spanish Kingdom in the Spanish-American War and 
2
acquired by conquest Puerto Rico, Guam, and the 
3

(2) In 1900, Congress established a civilian 
5
government on the island through the Foraker Act.

Among other points, that Act established an ‘‘execu-

tive council’’ consisting of various department heads

15
poses of the Constitution’s Uniformity Clause, Puer-
16
to Rico was not part of the United States. Justice 
17
White, in concurrence, opined that Congress has dis-
18
cretion to decide whether and when to incorporate a 
19
territory into the United States. 
20

21
over matters of internal governance in 1950 with the 
22
passage of the Puerto Rico Federal Relations Act of 
23

24
tional government for the island which was adopted

2

(6) On November 18, 1953, the United Nations 
4
recognized Puerto Rico as a self-governing political 
5
entity under the United Nations General Assembly 
6
Resolution 748.

(7) The United States has a legal duty to com-
8
ply with Article 1 of the International Covenant on 
9
Civil and Political Rights, which establishes that all 
10
peoples have the right to self-determination and ‘‘by 
11
virtue of that right they freely determine their polit-
12
ical status and freely pursue their economic, social 
13
and cultural development’’.
