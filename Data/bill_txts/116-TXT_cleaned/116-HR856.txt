RESOLUTION 
Opposing kleptocracy around the world and supporting ef-
forts to develop an effective, independent International 
Anti-Corruption Court. 
Whereas kleptocracy involves a country’s leaders at the high-
est levels illegally using public power for private gain, in-
cluding by bribery, nepotism, fraud, or embezzlement; 
Whereas the corrupt actions of leaders may be facilitated and 
enabled by professionals who provide those leaders with 
money management, legal public relations, and other 
services; 
Whereas kleptocracy has deprived citizens of countries across 
the world of billions of dollars; 
Whereas an estimated 5 percent of the world’s gross domestic 
product (GDP) is lost to corruption;

Whereas research by the International Monetary Fund has 
found 
that 
corruption 
is 
responsible 
for 
$1,000,000,000,000 in lost tax revenues; 
Whereas kleptocracy fosters an environment of criminality in 
a country, as leaders make corrupt use of or undermine 
institutions to allow them to steal, launder, hide, and 
store wealth, rather than effectively govern their coun-
tries; 
Whereas an environment of criminality creates incentives for 
human rights abuses, including restrictions on the free-
dom of the press, as leaders stigmatize and silence those 
who would shed light on their activities; 
Whereas kleptocracy also undermines human rights by steal-
ing funds that could otherwise be invested in health, edu-
cation, safe drinking water, and the defense and pro-
motion of other rights; 
Whereas the amassing of illicit wealth in the hands of a few 
is detrimental to democratic processes and the rule of 
law; 
Whereas the World Bank has found corruption disproportion-
ately harms the poor by impeding access to social services 
and the investment necessary for jobs and economic 
growth; 
Whereas grand corruption fuels the global migration crisis by 
depriving people of opportunities and livelihoods and gen-
erating criminal violence, thus pushing thousands around 
the world to leave their kleptocratic home countries and 
threatening international peace and security; 
Whereas kleptocracy is a global problem requiring a coordi-
nated international response;

•HRES 856 IH 
Whereas the United States has long led the fight against 
kleptocracy domestically and internationally; 
Whereas the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 allows 
the United States to prosecute businesses that engage in 
corrupt behavior and has served as a model for the legis-
lation of other countries concerned with good governance 
and best practices; 
Whereas United States actions under the Foreign Corrupt 
Practices Act of 1977 have led to the seizure of millions 
of dollars in assets from corrupt foreign governments; 
Whereas the United States has used existing criminal money 
laundering, mail and wire fraud, and other authorities to 
investigate and prosecute kleptocrats for bribery; 
Whereas democratic countries are considering the expansion 
of foreign bribery laws to address the demand side of 
bribery; 
Whereas the United States is a state party to the Inter- 
American Convention Against Corruption, the United 
Nations 
Convention 
Against 
Corruption, 
and 
the 
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Develop-
ment’s Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign 
Public Officials in International Business Transactions; 
Whereas existing international conventions facilitate inter-
state cooperation in the fight against many forms of cor-
ruption, but are not sufficient to eliminate the impunity 
from which kleptocrats in many countries benefit; 
Whereas judicial systems in kleptocracies often fail because 
they have been captured or weakened by rulers seeking 
to protect their ill-gotten gains; 
Whereas an International Anti-Corruption Court (IACC) 
shows great promise for combating kleptocracy and cor-

ruption by reducing impunity for acts of grand corrup-
tion around the world; 
Whereas an IACC would complement efforts to enforce anti- 
kleptocracy laws in countries where domestic judicial sys-
tems have failed; 
Whereas an IACC could offer an alternative avenue for citi-
zens of many countries to pursue the return of stolen 
money, property, and other assets; 
Whereas an IACC would be structured to fairly and inde-
pendently investigate and prosecute kleptocracy as de-
fined by law; 
Whereas an IACC would be staffed with expert investigators 
and internationally recognized judges with the expertise 
and experience needed to effectively pursue kleptocracy 
cases; 
Whereas an IACC would safeguard the rights of the accused 
in keeping with internationally recognized due process 
rights; 
Whereas an IACC would even the playing field for United 
States businesses by strengthening the enforcement of 
antikleptocracy laws everywhere in the world; 
Whereas entering into international treaties is an exercise of 
national sovereignty; 
Whereas international judicial mechanisms already operate 
only when domestic mechanisms are unwilling or unable; 
and 
Whereas IACC rulings would be enforced through the exer-
cise of the powers of its member states: Now, therefore, 
be it
