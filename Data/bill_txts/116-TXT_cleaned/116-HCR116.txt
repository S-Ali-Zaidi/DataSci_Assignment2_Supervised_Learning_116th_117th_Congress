bias, fairness, and privacy issues in artificial in-
1
telligence; 
2
(B) improve access to non-sensitive govern-
3
ment datasets to help reduce bias in the data 
4
used to train artificial intelligence systems; 
5
(C) implement title II of the Foundations 
6
for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018
