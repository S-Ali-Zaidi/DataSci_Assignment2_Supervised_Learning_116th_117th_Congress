1
The purposes of this Act are— 
2
(1) to encourage the research and use of inno-
3
vative materials, in concert with traditional mate-
4
rials, and associated techniques in the construction 
5
and preservation of the domestic infrastructure net-
6
work; 
7
(2) to accelerate the deployment and extend the 
8
