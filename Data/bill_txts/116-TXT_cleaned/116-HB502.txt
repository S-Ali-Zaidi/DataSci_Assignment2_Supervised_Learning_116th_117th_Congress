SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
The Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) According to the Drug Enforcement Admin-
3
istration (DEA) 2017 National Drug Threat Assess-
4
ment, transnational criminal organizations are in-
5
creasingly using virtual currencies. 
6
(2) In its 2015 National Money Laundering 
7
Risk Assessment, the Department of the Treasury 
8
concluded: ‘‘The development of virtual currencies is 
9
an attempt to meet a legitimate market demand. Ac-
10
cording to a Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago econ-
11
omist, United States consumers want payment op-
12
tions that are versatile and that provide immediate 
13
finality. No United States payment method meets 
14
that description, although cash may come closest. 
15
Virtual currencies can mimic cash’s immediate final-
16
ity and anonymity and are more versatile than cash 
17
for online and cross-border transactions, making vir-
18
tual currencies vulnerable for illicit transactions.’’. 
19
(3) Virtual currencies have become a prominent 
20
method to pay for goods and services associated with 
21
illegal sex trafficking and drug trafficking, which are 
22
two of the most detrimental and troubling illegal ac-
23
tivities facilitated by online marketplaces. 
24
(4) Online marketplaces, including the dark 
25
web, have become a prominent platform to buy, sell,

and advertise for illicit goods and services associated 
1
with sex trafficking and drug trafficking. 
2
(5) According to the International Labour Or-
3
ganization, in 2016, 4.8 million people in the world 
4
were victims of forced sexual exploitation, and in 
5
2014, the global profit from commercial sexual ex-
6
ploitation was $99 billion. 
7
(6) In 2016, within the United States, the Cen-
8
ter for Disease Control estimated that there were 
9
64,000 deaths related to drug overdose, and the 
10
most severe increase in drug overdoses were those 
11
associated with fentanyl and fentanyl analogs (syn-
12
thetic opioids), which amounted to over 20,000 over-
13
dose deaths. 
14
(7) According to the United States Department 
15
of the Treasury 2015 National Money Laundering 
16
Risk Assessment, an estimated $64 billion is gen-
17
erated annually from United States drug trafficking 
18
sales. 
19
(8) Illegal fentanyl in the United States origi-
20
nates primarily from China, and it is readily avail-
21
able to purchase through online marketplaces.

2
(1) how online marketplaces, including the dark 
3

4
cilitate the financing of goods or services associated 
5
with sex trafficking or drug trafficking (specifically, 
6
opioids and synthetic opioids, including fentanyl, 
7
fentanyl analogs, and any precursor chemicals asso-
8
ciated with manufacturing fentanyl or fentanyl 
9
analogs) destined for, originating from, or within the 
10
United States; 
11
(2) how financial payment methods, including 
12
virtual currencies and peer-to-peer mobile payment 
13
services, are being utilized by online marketplaces to 
14
facilitate the buying, selling, or financing of goods 
15
and services associated with sex or drug trafficking 
16
destined for, originating from, or within the United 
17
States; 
18
(3) how virtual currencies are being used to fa-
19
cilitate the buying, selling, or financing of goods and 
20
services associated with sex or drug trafficking, des-
21
tined for, originating from, or within the United 
22

destined for, originating from, or within the United 
10
States;

(6) Federal and State agency efforts to impede 
12
the buying, selling, or financing of goods and serv-
13
ices associated with sex or drug trafficking through 
14
online marketplaces or virtual currencies that are 
15
destined for, originating from, or within the United 
16
States, including efforts to prevent the proceeds 
17
from sex or drug trafficking from entering the 
18
United States banking system through online mar-
19
ketplaces or virtual currencies; and 
20
(7) to what extent can the immutable and 
21
