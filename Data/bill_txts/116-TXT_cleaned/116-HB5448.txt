A BILL 
To direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to 
conduct a study to assess the unintended impacts on 
the health and safety of people engaged in transactional 
sex, in connection with the enactment of the Allow States 
and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act of 
2017 (Public Law 115–164) and the loss of interactive 
computer services that host information related to sexual 
exchange, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘SESTA/FOSTA Ex-
2
amination of Secondary Effects for Sex Workers Study 
3
Act’’ or the ‘‘SAFE SEX Workers Study Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
5
The Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) People who engage in consensual, trans-
7
actional sex utilize online platforms to protect their 
8
health, safety, and independence. This use includes 
9
building community connections, distribution of 
10
harm reduction information and techniques, identi-
11
fication and screening of potential clients, and nego-
12
tiating the terms of consensual, transactional sex 
13
services, including condom use and other harm re-
14
duction strategies. 
15
(2) Widespread discrimination against popu-
16
lations, including LGBTQI+ individuals, particu-
17
larly transgender women of color, prevents many 
18
from accessing formal employment resources and 
19
educational opportunities. 
20
(3) In the 2015 United States Transgender 
21
Survey conducted by the National Center for 
22
Transgender Equality, 19 percent of respondents re-
23
ported having exchanged sex for resources, such as 
24
for money, food, or a place to sleep. Transgender 
25
women of color, including Black (42 percent), Amer-
26

•HR 5448 IH
ican Indian (28 percent), multiracial (27 percent), 
1
Latina (23 percent), and Asian (22 percent) re-
2
spondents were more likely to have participated in 
3
sex work than the overall sample. 
4
(4) In the 2015 United States Transgender 
5
Survey, respondents who experienced homelessness 
6
in the past year (17 percent) were more than three 
7
times as likely to have participated in sex work dur-
8
ing that year compared to the overall sample. 
9
(5) On a broader scale, internet platforms fos-
10
ter connections between people and play an integral 
11
part in American society. Meaningful regulation of 
12
internet platforms must take into account the role 
13
they play in the health, safety, and privacy of all 
14
people’s lives. 
15
(6) While policymakers, representatives of inter-
16
net platforms, and some advocates have discussed 
17
ways to mitigate the use of internet platforms to de-
18
crease exploitation, people who consensually trade 
19
sex are rarely involved in the drafting of legislation 
20
or policies, or in assessing their impact, despite 
21
being amongst the populations who are impacted by 
22
legislation and policies related to the regulation of 
23
these internet platforms.

(7) On February 27, 2018, the House of Rep-
1
resentatives passed the Allow States to Fight Online 
2
Sex Trafficking Act, known as SESTA/FOSTA. 
3
While SESTA/FOSTA holds websites liable for user- 
4
generated content that facilitates sex trafficking, it 
5
also impacts online platforms where users discuss 
6
consensual sex work and related topics. 
7
(8) Contemporaneously with the passage of 
8
SESTA/FOSTA in the Senate on March 21, 2018, 
9
websites preemptively shut down, some directly cit-
10
ing the law’s passage as the rationale for closure. 
11
(9) One week before President Donald Trump 
12
signed SESTA/FOSTA into law (Public Law 115– 
13
164), the Department of Justice seized Back-
14
page.com and arrested Backpage employees, citing 
15
promotion of prostitution and money laundering 
16
charges, similar to the Department of Homeland Se-
17
curity’s seizure of Rentboy.com only a few years 
18
prior. 
19
(10) While these websites and individual ac-
20
counts have been closing down, there has been no 
21
national investigation rigorously examining the im-
22
pact of losing access to these platforms on the health 
23
and safety of people in consensual, transactional sex 
24
work. Regional and anecdotal information from 
25
01:46 Dec 27, 2019

•HR 5448 IH
health and safety service providers and sex workers 
1
has pointed to significant impacts on the health and 
2
safety of people who engage in consensual, trans-
3
actional sex. 
4
(11) Community organizations have reported 
5
increased homelessness of sex workers, including of 
6
sex workers who are caretakers for their families 
7
and have lost the economic stability provided by ac-
8
cess to online platforms. 
9
(12) Sex workers have reported a reduced abil-
10
ity to screen potential clients for safety, and nego-
11
tiate for boundaries such as condom use, resulting in 
12
reports of physical and sexual violence. 
13
(13) Many sex workers have turned to street- 
14
based work, which has historically involved higher 
15
rates of violence than other forms of transactional 
16
sex. Street-based sex workers have frequently noted 
17
practices which harm their health and safety, such 
18
as the confiscation of condoms by police, or use of 
19
condoms as evidence of arrest for prostitution. 
20
(14) With this new level of precarity, isolation, 
21
and vulnerability, there is substantial anecdotal evi-
22
dence that members of the sex work community are 
23
more frequently being contacted by third parties 
24
seeking to engage in management activities. This in-
25
01:46 Dec 27, 2019

•HR 5448 IH
cludes both sex workers who had always worked 
1
independently, as well as those who have previously 
2
experienced violence and exploitation by a third 
3
party. 
4
(15) The United States Government has long 
5
discussed the importance of assessing collateral con-
6
sequences when looking at other industries. A com-
7
prehensive study is essential to evaluate the impact 
8
on the health and safety of those involved in consen-
9
sual, transactional sex, who are increasingly losing 
10
access to digital platforms, which have been used for 
11
harm reduction information and techniques, and to 
12
screen clients. Informed government policies begin 
13
with seeking out relevant information to better guide 
14
our actions moving forward.
