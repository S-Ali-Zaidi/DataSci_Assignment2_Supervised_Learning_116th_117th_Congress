A BILL 
To prohibit use of facial recognition technology on any image 
acquired by body-worn cameras of law enforcement offi-
cers, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Stop Biometric Sur-
4
veillance by Law Enforcement Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 7235 IH
(1) Facial recognition and other biometric sur-
1
veillance technology pose unique and significant 
2
threats to the civil rights and civil liberties of resi-
3
dents and visitors. 
4
(2) The use of facial recognition and other bio-
5
metric surveillance is the functional equivalent of re-
6
quiring every person to show a personal photo iden-
7
tification card at all times in violation of recognized 
8
constitutional rights. This technology also allows 
9
people to be tracked without consent. 
10
(3) It would also generate massive databases 
11
about law-abiding Americans, and may chill the ex-
12
ercise of free speech in public places. 
13
(4) Facial recognition and other biometric sur-
14
veillance technology has been repeatedly dem-
15
onstrated to misidentify women, young people, and 
16
people of color and to create an elevated risk of 
17
harmful ‘‘false positive’’ identifications. 
18
(5) Facial and other biometric surveillance 
19
would corrupt the core purpose of officer-worn body- 
20
worn cameras by transforming those devices from 
21
transparency and accountability tools into roving 
22
surveillance systems. 
23
(6) The use of facial recognition and other bio-
24
metric surveillance would disproportionately impact 
25

•HR 7235 IH
the civil rights and civil liberties of persons who live 
1
in highly policed communities. 
2
(7) Its use would also diminish effective polic-
3
ing and public safety by discouraging people in these 
4
communities, including victims of crime, undocu-
5
mented persons, people with unpaid fines and fees, 
6
and those with prior criminal history from seeking 
7
police assistance or from assisting the police.
