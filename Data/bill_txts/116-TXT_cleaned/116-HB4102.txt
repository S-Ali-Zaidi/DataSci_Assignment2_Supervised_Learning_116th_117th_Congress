SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress makes the following findings: 
2
(1) The United States continues to experience 
3
an epidemic of overdoses of fentanyl, heroin, and 
4
prescription opioids that claimed more than 49,000 
5
lives in 2017. 
6
(2) Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that de-
7
presses central nervous system and respiratory func-
8
tion, with euphoric effects that may be more power-
9
ful than the euphoric effects of heroin or morphine. 
10
(3) The effect of fentanyl can be up to 50 times 
11
stronger than the effect of heroin, and 50 to 100 
12
times stronger than the effect of morphine. 
13
(4) Although pharmaceutical fentanyl can be di-
14
verted for misuse, most fentanyl deaths are believed 
15
to be linked to illicit fentanyl. 
16
(5) Across the United States, the use of illicit 
17
fentanyl and deaths related to that use are rising at 
18
alarming rates. 
19
(6) According to the Centers for Disease Con-
20
trol and Prevention, between 2016 and 2017, the 
21
rate of drug overdose deaths involving synthetic 
22
opioids—largely fentanyl—increased by 45 percent. 
23
(7) In 2017, more than 28,000 deaths involving 
24
synthetic opioids—largely fentanyl—occurred in the 
25
United States, outnumbering deaths from any other 
26

type of opioid. According to preliminary data from 
1
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that 
2
figure increased to nearly 32,000 deaths in 2018. 
3
(8) Depending on the route of administration 
4
and other factors, as little as 2 milligrams of illicit 
5
fentanyl (similar in size to a few grains of salt) can 
6
be fatal. 
7
(9) Fentanyl is the primary synthetic opioid 
8
available in the United States. 
9
(10) The internet has significantly increased 
10
the availability of illicit fentanyl and other illicit syn-
11
thetic opioids in the United States. Those drugs are 
12
widely advertised for sale, and are available for pur-
13
chase, on the open and dark web. 
14
(11) Most illicit fentanyl trafficked into the 
15
United States originates in the People’s Republic of 
16
China and is transported into the United States in 
17
parcel packages directly from the People’s Republic 
18
of China or from the People’s Republic of China 
19
through Canada. 
20
(12) Fentanyl arriving in the mail directly from 
21
the People’s Republic of China can have exception-
22
ally high purities—over 90 percent—posing a great 
23
risk to the purchaser and user, and allowing it to be

adulterated many more times and turned into larger 
1
amounts for sale and use. 
2
(13) As the designated postal operator in the 
3
United States, the United States Postal Service ac-
4
cepts and delivers inbound international mail on be-
5
half of designated postal operators around the world. 
6
(14) Express consignment operators accept 
7
items from customers in foreign countries and trans-
8
port and deliver those items in the United States. 
9
(15) U.S. Customs and Border Protection in-
10
spects mail and express cargo arriving in the United 
11
States and seizes illegal goods, including those that 
12
may pose threats to health and safety, ecology, and 
13
businesses in the United States. 
14
(16) U.S. Customs and Border Protection is 
15
able to screen only a tiny fraction of all inbound 
16
international mail and express cargo into the United 
17
States, contributing to the influx of illicit fentanyl 
18
that is causing tens of thousands of deaths in the 
19
United States annually. 
20
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
21
It is the sense of Congress that— 
22
(1) in order to save potentially tens of thou-
23
sands of lives in the United States annually, the 
24
Federal Government must make it a high priority to

stem the flow of illicit fentanyl into the United 
1
States through increased detection and interception 
2
of inbound international mail and express cargo; and 
3
(2) the Federal Government must resolve to 
4
achieve the automated screening of 100 percent of 
5
international mail and express cargo inbound into 
6
the United States from high-risk countries for illicit 
7
fentanyl and other illicit synthetic opioids.
