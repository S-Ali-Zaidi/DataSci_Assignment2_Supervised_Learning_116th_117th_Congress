•HR 1493 IH
(1) On February 13, 2018, the Director of Na-
1
tional Intelligence stated in his testimony before the 
2
Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that ‘‘Rus-
3
sia, China, Iran, and North Korea will pose the 
4
greatest cyber threats to the United States during 
5
the next year’’ through the use of cyber operations 
6
as low-cost tools of statecraft, and assessed that 
7
these states would ‘‘work to use cyber operations to 
8
achieve strategic objectives unless they face clear re-
9
percussions for their cyber operations’’. 
10
(2) The 2017 Worldwide Threat Assessment of 
11
the United States Intelligence Community stated 
12
that ‘‘The potential for surprise in the cyber realm 
13
will increase in the next year and beyond as billions 
14
more digital devices are connected—with relatively 
15
little built-in security—and both nation states and 
16
malign actors become more emboldened and better 
17
equipped in the use of increasingly widespread cyber 
18
toolkits. The risk is growing that some adversaries 
19
will conduct cyber attacks—such as data deletion or 
20
localized and temporary disruptions of critical infra-
21
structure—against the United States in a crisis 
22
short of war.’’. 
23
(3) On March 29, 2017, President Donald J. 
24
Trump deemed it necessary to continue the national

emergency declared in Executive Order No. 13694 
1
as ‘‘Significant malicious cyber-enabled activities 
2
originating from, or directed by persons located, in 
3
whole or in substantial part, outside the United 
4
States, continue to pose an unusual and extraor-
5
dinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, 
6
and economy of the United States.’’. 
7
(4) On January 5, 2017, former Director of 
8
National Intelligence, James Clapper, former Under-
9
secretary of Defense for Intelligence, Marcel Lettre, 
10
and the Commander of the United States Cyber 
11
Command, Admiral Michael Rogers, submitted joint 
12
testimony to the Committee on Armed Services of 
13
the Senate that stated ‘‘As of late 2016 more than 
14
30 nations are developing offensive cyber attack ca-
15
pabilities’’ and that ‘‘Protecting critical infrastruc-
16
ture, such as crucial energy, financial, manufac-
17
turing, transportation, communication, and health 
18
systems, will become an increasingly complex na-
19
tional security challenge.’’.

21
affiliated with foreign governments have conducted

cyber operations targeting companies and critical in-

(A) on March 15, 2018, five Russian enti-
3
ties and 19 Russian individuals were designated 
4
under the Countering America’s Adversaries 
5
Through Sanctions Act, as well as pursuant to 
6
Executive Order No. 13694, for interference in 
7
the 2016 United States elections and other ma-
8
licious cyber-enabled activities; 
9
(B) on March 24, 2016, seven Iranians 
10
working for Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps- 
11
affiliated entities were indicted for conducting 
12
distributed denial of service attacks against the 
13
financial sector in the United States from 2012 
14
to 2013; and 
15
(C) on May 19, 2014, five Chinese military 
16
hackers were charged for hacking United States 
17
companies in the nuclear power, metals, and 
18
solar products industries, and engaging in eco-
19
nomic espionage. 
20
(6) In May 2017, North Korea released 
21
‘‘WannaCry’’ pseudo-ransomware, which posed a sig-
22
nificant risk to the economy, national security, and 
23
the citizens of the United States and the world, as

it resulted in the infection of over 300,000 computer

(7) In June 2017, Russia carried out the most 
5
destructive cyber-enabled operation in history, re-
6
leasing the NotPetya malware that caused billions of 
7
dollars’ worth of damage within Ukraine and across 
8
Europe, Asia, and the Americas. 
9
(8) In May 2018, the Department of State, 
10
pursuant to section 3(b) of Executive Order No. 
11
13800, prepared recommendations to the President 
12
on Deterring Adversaries and Better Protecting the 
13
American People From Cyber Threats, which stated 
14
‘‘With respect to activities below the threshold of the 
15
use of force, the United States should, working with 
16
likeminded partners when possible, adopt an ap-
17
proach of imposing swift, costly, and transparent 
18
consequences on foreign governments responsible for 
19
significant malicious cyber activities aimed at harm-
20
