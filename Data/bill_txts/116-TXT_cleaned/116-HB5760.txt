SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The Nation, and every critical infrastruc-
3
ture sector, depends on reliable electricity. 
4
(2) Intelligent electronic devices, advanced ana-
5
lytics, and information systems used across the en-
6
ergy sector are essential to maintaining reliable op-
7
eration of the electric grid. 
8
(3) The cybersecurity threat landscape is con-
9
stantly changing and attacker capabilities are ad-
10
vancing rapidly, requiring ongoing modifications, ad-
11
vancements, and investments in technologies and 
12
procedures to maintain security. 
13
(4) It is in the national interest for Federal 
14
agencies to invest in cybersecurity research that in-
15
forms and facilitates private sector investment and 
16
use of advanced cybersecurity tools and procedures 
17
to protect information systems. 
18
(5) The number of devices and systems con-
19
necting to the electric grid is increasing, and inte-
20
grating cybersecurity protections into information 
21
systems when they are built is more effective than 
22
modifying products after installation to meet cyber-
23
security goals. 
24
(6) An understanding of human factors can be 
25
leveraged to understand the behavior of cyber threat
