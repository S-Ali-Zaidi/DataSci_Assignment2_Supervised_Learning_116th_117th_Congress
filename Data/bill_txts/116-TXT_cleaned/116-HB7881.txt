To amend the Ted Stevens Olympic and Amateur Sports 
Act to provide for congressional oversight of the board 
of directors of the United States Olympic and 
Paralympic Committee and to protect amateur athletes 
from emotional, physical, and sexual abuse, and for other 
purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Empowering Olympic, 
2
Paralympic, and Amateur Athletes Act of 2020’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress makes the following findings: 
5
(1) The courageous voice of survivors is a call 
6
to action to end emotional, physical, and sexual 
7
abuse in the Olympic and Paralympic movement. 
8
(2) Larry Nassar, the former national team 
9
doctor for USA Gymnastics, sexually abused over 
10
300 athletes for over two decades because of ineffec-
11
tive oversight by USA Gymnastics and the United 
12
States Olympic Committee. 
13
(3) While the case of Larry Nassar is unprece-
14
dented in scale, the case is hardly the only recent in-
15
cident of sexual abuse in amateur sports. 
16
(4) Survivors of Larry Nassar’s abuse and all 
17
survivors of abuse in the Olympic and Paralympic 
18
movement deserve justice and redress for the wrongs 
19
the survivors have suffered. 
20
(5) After a comprehensive congressional inves-
21
tigation, including interviews and statements from 
22
survivors, former and current organization officials, 
23
law enforcement, and advocates, Congress found 
24
that the United States Olympic Committee and USA 
25
Gymnastics fundamentally failed to uphold their ex-
26

H7881
3 
•HR 7881 IH
isting statutory purposes and duty to protect ama-
1
teur athletes from sexual, emotional, or physical 
2
abuse. 
3
(6) USA Gymnastics and the United States 
4
Olympic Committee knowingly concealed abuse by 
5
Larry Nassar, leading to the abuse of dozens of ad-
6
ditional amateur athletes during the period begin-
7
ning in the summer of 2015 and ending in Sep-
8
tember 2016. 
9
(7) 
Ending 
abuse 
in 
the 
Olympic 
and 
10
Paralympic movement requires enhanced oversight 
11
to ensure that the Olympic and Paralympic move-
12
ment does more to serve athletes and protect their 
13
voice and safety.
