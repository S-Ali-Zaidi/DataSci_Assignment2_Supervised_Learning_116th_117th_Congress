•HR 1923 IH
(1) The tireless and passionate efforts of the 
1
suffragists, their supporters, and other stakeholders 
2
contributed to the movement to grant and protect 
3
the right of all women to vote. 
4
(2) On August 26, 1920, after a long campaign 
5
by suffragists across the country, the United States 
6
Constitution was amended with the 19th Amend-
7
ment, granting women the right to vote. 
8
(3) On June 24, 1924, all Native Americans 
9
were granted citizenship, and by extension the right 
10
to vote. 
11
(4) In 1948, the legal victories of Native Amer-
12
ican veterans granted protections for the right of all 
13
Native men and women to vote. 
14
(5) On June 27, 1952, the Immigration and 
15
Nationality Act of 1952 was enacted, granting citi-
16
zenship to all individuals of Asian descent, and by 
17
extension, the right to vote. 
18
(6) Enactment of the Voting Rights Act of 
19
1965 on August 6, 1965, granted Black women pro-
20
tections to overcome the legal barriers that pre-
21
vented many from exercising their right to vote even 
22
though all Blacks had been granted citizenship in 
23
1868 with ratification of the 14th Amendment.

(7) On August 6, 1975, the amendments to the 
1
reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 re-
2
moved language barriers to mitigate discrimination 
3
against Hispanic, Asian, and Native American vot-
4
ers. 
5
(8) It was not until March 29, 1961, when the 
6
23rd Amendment passed that women in Washington, 
7
DC, were allowed to vote in all elections. 
8
(9) Women’s history and the movement for 
9
women’s rights that the suffragists began extends 
10
beyond ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment. 
11
(10) August 26, 2020, marks the centennial of 
12
the day that women were granted the right to vote 
13
in America.
