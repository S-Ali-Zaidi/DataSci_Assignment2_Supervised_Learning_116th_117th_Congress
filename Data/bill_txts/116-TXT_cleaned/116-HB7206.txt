‘‘§ 242A. Excessive force 
1
‘‘(a) INTENTIONAL ACTS.—Whoever, acting under 
2
color of law, causes bodily injury to another through the 
3

4
more than ten years; and if death results, shall be impris-
5
oned for any term of years or for life. 
6
‘‘(b) RECKLESS ACTS.—Whoever, acting under color 
7
of law, causes bodily injury to another through the reck-
8
less use of excessive force, shall be imprisoned not more 
9
than five years; and, if death results, shall be imprisoned 
10
not more than 20 years. 
11
‘‘(c) FAILURE TO INTERVENE.— 
12
‘‘(1) Whoever, acting under color of law, is con-
13
temporaneously aware of an ongoing violation of 
14
subsection (a) or (b), has the opportunity to stop or 
15
prevent the use of excessive force, and chooses not 
16
to intervene shall be imprisoned not more than 5 
17
years; and if death results, shall be imprisoned not 
18
more than 20 years.

‘‘(2) It shall not be a defense under this sub-
20

23
using excessive force.

25
fense under this section, there need not be proof that the

defendant had familiarity with this code section, or had 
1
any knowledge that any particular constitutional amend-
2
ment, Federal or State law, or any policy or regulation 
3
prohibited the use of force at issue. 
4
‘‘(e) DEFINITIONS.— 
5
‘‘(1) INTENTIONAL.—Purposefully using more 
6
force than what the person knows is reasonably nec-
7
essary under all the facts and circumstances. 
8
‘‘(2) RECKLESS.—Consciously disregarding a 
9
substantial and unjustifiable risk that excessive force 
10
will result from the person’s actions. The risk must 
11
be of such a nature and degree that, considering the 
12
nature and purpose of the person’s conduct and the 
13
circumstances known to that person, its disregard 
14
involves a gross deviation from the standard of con-
15
duct that a law-abiding person, acting under color of 
16
law, would observe in the person’s situation. 
17
‘‘(3) EXCESSIVE FORCE.—Force that is more 
18
than what is reasonably necessary to accomplish a 
19
legitimate law enforcement function. In a jail, pris-
20
on, or other correctional setting, force that is more 
21
than is reasonably necessary to accomplish a legiti-
22
mate penological function.

‘‘(4) COLOR

LAW.—A person acts under 
24
color of law if the person is performing a legitimate
