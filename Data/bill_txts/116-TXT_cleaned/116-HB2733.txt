SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. 
1
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) On some reservations, Indian women are 
3
murdered at more than 10 times the national aver-
4
age. 
5
(2) American Indians and Alaska Natives are 
6
2.5 times as likely to experience violent crimes—and 
7
at least 2 times more likely to experience rape or 
8
sexual assault crimes—compared to all other races, 
9
according to the National Congress of American In-
10
dians. 
11
(3) More than 4 in 5 American Indian and 
12
Alaska Native women, or 84.3 percent, have experi-
13
enced violence in their lifetime, according to the Na-
14
tional Institute of Justice. 
15
(4) More than 4 in 5 American Indian and 
16
Alaska Native men, or 81.6 percent, have experi-
17
enced violence in their lifetime, according to the Na-
18
tional Institute of Justice. 
19
(5) According to the Centers for Disease Con-
20
trol and Prevention, homicide is the third leading 
21
cause of death among American Indian and Alaska 
22
Native women and girls between 10 and 24 years of 
23
age and the fifth leading cause of death for Amer-
24
ican Indian and Alaska Native women between 25 
25
and 34 years of age.

•HR 2733 IH
(6) Investigation into cases of missing and mur-
1
dered Indian women is made difficult for Tribal law 
2
enforcement agencies due to a lack of resources, 
3
such as— 
4
(A) necessary training, equipment, or 
5
funding; 
6
(B) a lack of interagency cooperation; and 
7
(C) a lack of appropriate laws in place. 
8
(7) The complicated jurisdictional scheme that 
9
exists in Indian country— 
10
(A) has a significant negative impact on 
11
the ability to provide public safety to Indian 
12
communities; 
13
(B) has been increasingly exploited by 
14
criminals; and 
15
(C) requires a high degree of commitment 
16
and cooperation among Tribal, Federal, and 
17
State law enforcement officials. 
18
(8) In states with restrictive land settlement 
19
acts such as Maine and Alaska, ‘‘Indian country’’ is 
20
limited, resources for local tribal responses either 
21
nonexistent or insufficient to meet the needs, and ju-
22
risdiction is unnecessarily complicated and increases 
23
the already high levels of victimization of American 
24
Indian and Alaska Native women. According to the 
25

•HR 2733 IH
Indian Law and Order Commission Report, Alaska 
1
Native women are over-represented in the domestic 
2
violence victim population by 250 percent; they com-
3
prise 19 percent of the state population, but are 47 
4
percent of reported rape victims. These issues are 
5
further complicated as the Indian Law and Order 
6
Commission Report noted that at least 30 percent of 
7
villages lack any law enforcement at all. 
8
(b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this Act are— 
9
(1) to clarify the responsibilities of Federal, 
10
State, Tribal, and local governments and law en-
11
forcement agencies with respect to responding to 
12
cases of missing and murdered Indians; 
13
(2) to increase coordination and communication 
14
among Federal, State, Tribal, and local law enforce-
15
ment agencies, including medical examiner and cor-
16
oner offices; 
17
(3) to empower Tribal governments with the re-
18
sources and information necessary to effectively re-
19
spond to cases of missing and murdered Indians, in-
20
cluding Tribes located in any State known as a 
21
‘‘PL–280 State’’; and 
22
(4) to increase the collection of data related to 
23
missing and murdered Indian men, women, and chil-
24
