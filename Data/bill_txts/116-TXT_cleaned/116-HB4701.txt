SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Health Equity and 
2
Access under the Law for Immigrant Women and Families 
3
Act of 2019’’ or as the ‘‘HEAL for Immigrant Women 
4
and Families Act of 2019’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE. 
6
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds as follows: 
7
(1) Health insurance coverage reduces harmful 
8
disparities by alleviating cost barriers to and in-
9
creasing utilization of necessary health care services, 
10
especially among low-income and underserved popu-
11
lations, including women. 
12
(2) Based solely on their immigration status, 
13
many immigrants and their families face legal and 
14
policy restrictions on their ability to obtain afford-
15
able health insurance coverage through Medicaid, 
16
the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), 
17
and the health insurance exchanges. 
18
(3) Lack of health insurance coverage contrib-
19
utes to persistent disparities in the prevention, diag-
20
nosis, and treatment of negative health outcomes ex-
21
perienced by immigrants and their families. 
22
(4) Nearly half of immigrant women are of re-
23
productive age. Immigrant women are also dis-
24
proportionately living in low-income households and 
25
lacking health insurance coverage. Legal and policy 
26

•HR 4701 IH
barriers to affordable health insurance coverage 
1
therefore particularly exacerbate their risk of nega-
2
tive sexual, reproductive, and maternal health out-
3
comes, with lasting health and economic con-
4
sequences for immigrant women, their families, and 
5
society as a whole. 
6
(5) Denying health insurance coverage or im-
7
posing waiting periods for health insurance coverage 
8
unfairly hinders the ability of immigrants to attain 
9
good health and undermines the economic well-being 
10
of their families. 
11
(6) The population of immigrant families in the 
12
United States is expected to continue to grow. One 
13
in seven United States residents is foreign-born, and 
14
approximately one in four children in the United 
15
States has at least one immigrant parent. It is 
16
therefore in the Nation’s shared public health and 
17
economic interest to remove legal and policy barriers 
18
to affordable health insurance coverage based on im-
19
migration status. 
20
(7) Although Deferred Action for Childhood Ar-
21
rivals (DACA) recipients are authorized to live and 
22
work in the United States, they have been unfairly 
23
excluded from the definition of lawfully present and 
24
lawfully residing for purposes of health insurance

coverage through the Department of Health and 
1
Human Services, including Medicaid and CHIP, and 
2
the health insurance exchanges. 
3
(8) Immigration law is constantly evolving and 
4
new immigration categories for individuals with fed-
5
erally authorized presence in the United States may 
6
be created. 
7
(b) PURPOSE.—It is the purpose of this Act to— 
8
(1) ensure that all individuals who are lawfully 
9
present in the United States are eligible for all fed-
10
erally funded health care programs; and 
11
(2) advance the ability of undocumented indi-
12
viduals to obtain health insurance coverage through 
13
the health insurance exchanges.
