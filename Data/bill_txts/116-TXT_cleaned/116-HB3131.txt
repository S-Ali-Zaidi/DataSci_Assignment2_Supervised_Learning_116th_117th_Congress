SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The South Asian diaspora population in the 
3
United States is primarily from India, Pakistan, 
4
Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Fiji, 
5
Maldives, East Africa, the West Indies, and the Car-
6
ibbean. 
7
(2) Heart disease refers to several types of 
8
heart conditions; the most common form is coronary 
9
artery disease, which affects blood flow to the heart. 
10
(3) Heart disease is the leading cause of death 
11
for both men and women—one in every 4 deaths 
12
each year, according to the Centers for Disease Con-
13
trol and Prevention. 
14
(4) Risk factors for heart disease include diabe-
15
tes, high blood pressure, smoking, and abnormal 
16
cholesterol levels. 
17
(5) Though the traditional South Asian diet 
18
consists of lentils, vegetables, grains, and spices, 
19
there is higher consumption of suboptimal nutri-
20
tional elements including refined carbohydrates, 
21
trans fats, and sugar that have been associated with 
22
higher risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular dis-
23
ease. 
24
(6) South Asians in the United States have four 
25
times the risk of heart disease than the general pop-
26

ulation and have a much greater chance of having 
1
a heart attack before age 50, according to the Stan-
2
ford South Asian Translational Heart Initiative. 
3
(7) In addition, diabetes is one of the strongest 
4
risk factors for heart disease; South Asian Ameri-
5
cans have among the highest rates of type 2 diabetes 
6
in the Nation. 
7
(8) A Mediators of Atherosclerosis in South 
8
Asians Living in America (MASALA) showed a 26- 
9
percent prevalence of diabetes among South Asians, 
10
compared to 6 percent among Whites, 18 percent 
11
among 
African-Americans, 
17 
percent 
among 
12
Latinos, and 13 percent among Chinese-Americans 
13
in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. 
14
(9) Early intervention and treatment through 
15
awareness campaigns, nutritional education, and in-
16
struction on physical activity can greatly reduce the 
17
burden of diabetes, risk of heart disease, decreased 
18
quality of life, and untimely death. 
19
(10) Successful efforts to prevent and combat 
20
heart disease in the South Asian population of the 
21
United States can serve as a model for the general 
22
population.
