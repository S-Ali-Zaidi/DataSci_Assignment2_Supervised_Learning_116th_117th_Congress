SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress makes the following findings: 
2
(1) On February 1, 2019, Secretary of State 
3
Mike Pompeo announced the United States would 
4
immediately suspend its obligations and would with-
5
draw, in six months, from the Treaty between the 
6
United States of America and the Union of Soviet 
7
Socialist Republics on the Elimination of Their In-
8
termediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles, to-
9
gether with the Memorandum of Understanding and 
10
Two Protocols (commonly known as the ‘‘INF Trea-
11
ty’’), signed at Washington, December 8, 1987, and 
12
entered into force June 1, 1988. 
13
(2) The United States Senate provided its ad-
14
vice and consent to ratification of the INF Treaty 
15
on May 27, 1988, by a vote of 93 to 5. 
16
(3) The INF Treaty permanently bans the 
17
United States and twelve former Soviet republics, in-
18
cluding Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan, 
19
from testing or possessing ground-launched cruise or 
20
ballistic missiles of intermediate range (500 to 5,500 
21
kilometers, or roughly 300 to 3,400 miles). 
22
(4) The INF Treaty, signed by President Ron-
23
ald Reagan and Soviet General Secretary Mikhail 
24
Gorbachev, led to the elimination of entire classes of 
25
United States and Russian nuclear and conventional

ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles—2,692 
1
in total—supported by on-site inspections that al-
2
lowed both sides to ‘‘trust but verify’’ compliance 
3
with the Treaty. 
4
(5) The North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
5
(NATO) allies were deeply involved in the pursuit of 
6
negotiation on the INF Treaty and have significant 
7
national security interests in the Treaty’s preserva-
8
tion. The communique from the July 11, 2018, 
9
NATO Summit in Brussels stated that the INF 
10
Treaty ‘‘has been crucial to Euro-Atlantic security’’. 
11
(6) Less than one month prior to the announce-
12
ment of the United States intent to withdraw from 
13
the INF Treaty, then-Secretary of Defense Jim 
14
Mattis met with his NATO counterparts to discuss 
15
the full-range of diplomatic, economic, and INF- 
16
compliant military options to pressure the Russian 
17
Federation to return to compliance with the Treaty 
18
as outlined in the ‘‘Trump Administration INF 
19
Treaty Integrated Strategy’’ published December 8, 
20
2017. 
21
(7) Since the United States publicly declared in 
22
July 2014 that the Russian Federation was in viola-
23
tion of the INF Treaty’s prohibition on possessing, 
24
producing, or flight-testing a ground-launched cruise

missile (GLCM), which is the equivalent of the Rus-
1
sian SSC–8 missile system, the United States has 
2
worked with its NATO allies to identify a unified ap-
3
proach on the best way forward. 
4
(8) The United States did not exhaust diplo-
5
matic, economic, and military means to bring the 
6
Russian Federation back into compliance with the 
7
Treaty, and in 2018 alone, the United States can-
8
celled at least two strategic stability dialogues 
9
planned to be conducted with the Russian Federa-
10
tion. 
11
(9) On January 16, 2019, Under Secretary of 
12
State for Arms Control and International Security 
13
Andrea Thompson confirmed that the Russian Fed-
14
eration offered to exhibit the SSC–8 missile system 
15
for the United States, which, while insufficient in 
16
itself to resolve its Treaty violation, represented the 
17
first such offer since the first United States finding 
18
of non-compliance in 2014. 
19
(10) The United States withdrawal from the 
20
INF Treaty will allow the Russian Federation to es-
21
cape international criticism for its violation of the 
22
Treaty and sow division among NATO allies at a 
23
time when Alliance unity is critical to respond to a

range of destabilizing actions by the Russian Fed-
1
eration. 
2
(11) The United States withdrawal from the 
3
INF Treaty will free the Russian Federation to ex-
4
pand deployment of the SSC–8 missile system in 
5
ways that threaten NATO and Indo-Pacific allies 
6
without bearing any international legal cost in doing 
7
so. 
8
(12) The Department of Defense has also not 
9
yet identified the full estimated research, develop-
10
ment, testing, and evaluation, procurement, or per-
11
sonnel costs of producing, testing, and deploying a 
12
new short- or intermediate-range ground-launched 
13
cruise or ballistic missile currently prohibited by the 
14
INF Treaty. 
15
(13) No European or Asian ally has publicly de-
16
clared its willingness or readiness to host a future 
17
United States short- or intermediate-range ground- 
18
launched cruise or ballistic missile currently prohib-
19
ited by the INF Treaty should the United States 
20
seek to deploy that capability. 
21
(14) The Secretary General of NATO, Jens 
22
Stoltenberg, stated on October 24, 2018, that ‘‘we 
23
don’t want a new Cold War, we don’t want a new 
24
arms race and therefore I don’t foresee that Allies

will deploy more nuclear weapons in Europe as a re-
1
sponse to the new Russian missile,’’ which precedes 
2
United States National Security Advisor John 
3
Bolton’s statement of November 9, 2018, that 
4
‘‘there are no American plans to seek to deploy INF 
5
non-compliant missiles in Europe for the foreseeable 
6
future’’. 
7
(15) Any effort by the United States Govern-
8
ment to proceed beyond research and development of 
9
an intermediate-range cruise or ballistic missile that 
10
is nuclear armed will be portrayed in as deeply in-
11
consistent with the United States obligation under 
12
Article VI of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of 
13
Nuclear Weapons, signed at Washington, July 1, 
14
1968 (commonly known as the ‘‘NPT’’), to ‘‘pursue 
15
negotiations in good faith on effective measures re-
16
lating to the cessation of the nuclear arms race’’. 
17
(16) Achieving the objective of expanding the 
18
INF Treaty’s membership to the People’s Republic 
19
of China, which has deployed intermediate-range 
20
missile systems in great number, is greatly dimin-
21
ished if parties to the existing Treaty cease imple-
22
mentation. 
23
(17) The Congressional Budget Office in Octo-
24
ber 2017 estimated that the costs of United States

nuclear weapons spending over the next three dec-

ades 
will 
amount 
to 
$1,200,000,000,000, 
or 
2
$1,700,000,000,000 when adjusted for inflation, 
3
which does not include new systems proposed in the 
4
2018 United States Nuclear Posture Review such as 
5
a low-yield submarine-launched ballistic missile 
6
(SLBM), a sea-launched cruise missile (SLCM), and 
7
a ground-launched cruise missile (GLCM).

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
9
It is the sense of Congress that— 
10
(1) Secretary of State Pompeo’s announcement 
11
of the decision of the United States to withdraw 
12
from the INF Treaty, without proper consultation 
13
with Congress, is a serious breach of Congress’s 
14
proper constitutional role as a co-equal branch of 
15
government; 
16
(2) United States withdrawal from the INF 
17
Treaty will free the Russian Federation to deploy 
18
greater quantities of the SSC–8 missile to the det-
19
riment of United States national security and that 
20
of our allies in Europe and the Indo-Pacific; 
21
(3) withdrawal from the INF Treaty will fail to 
22
limit or eliminate China’s short- and intermediate- 
23
range missiles;

(4) the NATO alliance makes critical contribu-
1
tions to United States national security, and the 
2
failure to weigh the concerns of NATO allies risks 
3
weakening the joint resolve necessary to counter 
4
Russia’s aggressive behavior; and 
5
(5) as opposed to withdrawing from the INF 
6
Treaty, the United States should continue to ad-
7
vance other diplomatic, economic, and military meas-
8
ures outlined in the ‘‘Trump Administration INF 
9
Treaty Integrated Strategy’’ to resolve the concerns 
10
related to the Russian Federation’s violation of the 
11
Treaty and to reach agreement on measures to en-
12
sure the Treaty’s future viability.

7

(2) confirms that the United States has not re-

10
missile system, negotiations on a verifiable mutual 
11
agreement prohibiting the placement of INF-range 
12
missiles on NATO territory or within range of a 
13
NATO Member State, or any other transparency

measure which may successfully move Russia closer

to returning to compliance with the Treaty or pre-

within the NATO alliance.
