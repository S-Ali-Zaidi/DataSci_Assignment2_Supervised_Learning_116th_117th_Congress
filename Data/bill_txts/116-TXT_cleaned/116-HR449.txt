RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for a genuinely democratic repeat 
mayoral election in Istanbul, Turkey. 
Whereas, on March 31, 2019, the Republic of Turkey held 
local elections across each of its 81 provinces; 
Whereas this local election cycle included the election of 30 
metropolitan and 1,351 district municipal mayors as well 
as 1,251 provincial and 20,500 municipal councilors; 
Whereas more than 57,000,000 Turkish citizens were reg-
istered to vote and turnout was high with just under 85 
percent of registered voters casting their vote; 
Whereas this election was the first to be held since the coun-
try transitioned from a parliamentary to a Presidential 
system;

Whereas following the release of electoral results indicating a 
victory by a candidate from the opposition Republican 
People’s Party, the ruling Justice and Development 
Party (AKP) alleged that electoral irregularities invali-
dated the results of the election; 
Whereas, on May 7, 2019, the Turkish Supreme Election 
Council announced its decision to invalidate the results of 
the Istanbul mayoral election, citing irregularities in the 
administration of the polling stations, even though the re-
sults of the Istanbul district and provincial council elec-
tions, which the AKP won, will stand; 
Whereas a repeat election for Istanbul mayor has been called 
for June 23, 2019; 
Whereas these developments contributed to a perception that 
the invalidation was politically motivated; and 
Whereas such perceptions, regardless of their accuracy, can 
erode public confidence in electoral institutions: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives recog-
