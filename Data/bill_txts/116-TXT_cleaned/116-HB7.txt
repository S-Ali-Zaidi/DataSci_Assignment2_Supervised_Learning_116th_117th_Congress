A BILL 
To amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to provide 
more effective remedies to victims of discrimination in 
the payment of wages on the basis of sex, and for other 
purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Paycheck Fairness 
2
Act’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) Women have entered the workforce in 
6
record numbers over the past 50 years. 
7
(2) Despite the enactment of the Equal Pay Act 
8
of 1963, many women continue to earn significantly 
9
lower pay than men for equal work. These pay dis-
10
parities exist in both the private and governmental 
11
sectors. In many instances, the pay disparities can 
12
only be due to continued intentional discrimination 
13
or the lingering effects of past discrimination. 
14
(3) The existence of such pay disparities— 
15
(A) depresses the wages of working fami-
16
lies who rely on the wages of all members of the 
17
family to make ends meet; 
18
(B) undermines women’s retirement secu-
19
rity, which is often based on earnings while in 
20
the workforce; 
21
(C) prevents the optimum utilization of 
22
available labor resources; 
23
(D) has been spread and perpetuated, 
24
through commerce and the channels and instru-
25
21:35 Feb 08, 2019

•HR 7 IH
mentalities of commerce, among the workers of 
1
the several States; 
2
(E) burdens commerce and the free flow of 
3
goods in commerce; 
4
(F) constitutes an unfair method of com-
5
petition in commerce; 
6
(G) leads to labor disputes burdening and 
7
obstructing commerce and the free flow of 
8
goods in commerce; 
9
(H) interferes with the orderly and fair 
10
marketing of goods in commerce; and 
11
(I) in many instances, may deprive workers 
12
of equal protection on the basis of sex in viola-
13
tion of the 5th and 14th Amendments. 
14
(4)(A) Artificial barriers to the elimination of 
15
discrimination in the payment of wages on the basis 
16
of sex continue to exist decades after the enactment 
17
of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 
18
201 et seq.) and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 
19
U.S.C. 2000a et seq.). 
20
(B) These barriers have resulted, in significant 
21
part, because the Equal Pay Act of 1963 has not 
22
worked as Congress originally intended. Improve-
23
ments and modifications to the law are necessary to 
24
ensure that the Act provides effective protection to 
25
21:35 Feb 08, 2019
H7
5 
•HR 7 IH
those subject to pay discrimination on the basis of 
1
their sex. 
2
(C) Elimination of such barriers would have 
3
positive effects, including— 
4
(i) providing a solution to problems in the 
5
economy created by unfair pay disparities; 
6
(ii) substantially reducing the number of 
7
working women earning unfairly low wages, 
8
thereby reducing the dependence on public as-
9
sistance; 
10
(iii) promoting stable families by enabling 
11
all family members to earn a fair rate of pay; 
12
(iv) remedying the effects of past discrimi-
13
nation on the basis of sex and ensuring that in 
14
the future workers are afforded equal protection 
15
on the basis of sex; and 
16
(v) ensuring equal protection pursuant to 
17
Congress’ power to enforce the 5th and 14th 
18
Amendments. 
19
(5) The Department of Labor and the Equal 
20
Employment Opportunity Commission have impor-
21
tant and unique responsibilities to help ensure that 
22
women receive equal pay for equal work. 
23
(6) The Department of Labor is responsible 
24
for— 
25

•HR 7 IH
(A) collecting and making publicly avail-

able information about women’s pay;

(B) ensuring that companies receiving

Federal contracts comply with anti-discrimina-
4
tion affirmative action requirements of Execu-
5
tive Order 11246 (relating to equal employment 
6
opportunity); 
7
(C) disseminating information about wom-
8
en’s rights in the workplace; 
9
(D) helping women who have been victims 
10
of pay discrimination obtain a remedy; and 
11
(E) being proactive in investigating and 
12
prosecuting equal pay violations, especially sys-
13
temic violations, and in enforcing all of its man-
14
dates. 
15
(7) The Equal Employment Opportunity Com-
16
mission is the primary enforcement agency for 
17
claims made under the Equal Pay Act of 1963, and 
18
issues regulations and guidance on appropriate in-
19
terpretations of the law. 
20
(8) With a stronger commitment by the Depart-
21
ment of Labor and the Equal Employment Oppor-
22
tunity Commission to their responsibilities, increased

(9) Certain employers have already made great

strides in eradicating unfair pay disparities in the

workplace and their achievements should be recog-
5
nized.
