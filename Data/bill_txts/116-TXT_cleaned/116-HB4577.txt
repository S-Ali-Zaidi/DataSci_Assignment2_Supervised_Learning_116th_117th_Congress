A BILL 
To amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to promote 
the matriculation, and increase in the graduation rates, 
of individuals with disabilities within higher education. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Expanding Disability 
4
Access to Higher Education Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:

•HR 4577 IH
(1) Students who are low income attend institu-
1
tions of higher education at a rate significantly 
2
lower than middle- and high-income students. 
3
(2) Similarly, students who are first-generation 
4
college students or are from minority backgrounds 
5
attend institutions of higher education at lower rates 
6
than the general public. 
7
(3) Many students who are low income, first 
8
generation, or minorities also have a disability. 
9
(4) In the last decade, both high school and 
10
postsecondary graduation rates for students with 
11
disabilities were significantly lower than for students 
12
without disabilities. 
13
(5) In 2015, approximately 65 percent of the 
14
total population of adults 25 to 34 years old had 
15
completed some postsecondary education compared 
16
with approximately 44 percent of adults with disabil-
17
ities in the same age range. 
18
(6) For students with disabilities who do attend 
19
an institution of higher education, only half will re-
20
ceive a diploma compared to 72 percent of students 
21
without disabilities. 
22
(7) Many researchers cite lack of support, such 
23
as in-class accommodations, accessible housing, and 
24
accessible technology, as a significant challenge as 
25
00:30 Oct 05, 2019

•HR 4577 IH
students with disabilities transition from high school 
1
to postsecondary education. 
2
(8) As with their peers without disabilities who 
3
are first-generation students or come from low-in-
4
come backgrounds, students who are first-generation 
5
or low-income students with disabilities who receive 
6
mentoring and support services can successfully pre-
7
pare for, enroll in, and graduate from postsecondary 
8
education programs and gain greater economic con-
9
trol of their lives. 
10
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
11
gress that individuals with disabilities, particularly those 
12
who are low income or first generation, should be able to 
13
attend institutions of higher education at the same rate 
14
as their peers in the general population. 
15
(c) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this Act are the fol-
16
lowing: 
17
(1) To provide first-generation or low-income 
18
students with disabilities with information, support, 
19
and resources to matriculate and complete a course 
20
of study at an institution of higher education. 
21
(2) To encourage and support first-generation 
22
or low-income students with disabilities to achieve 
23
postsecondary credentials that benefit them and 
24
their communities both socially and economically.

(3) To increase the number of faculty with dis-
1
abilities in institutions of higher education. 
2
(4) To provide programs authorized under 
3
chapter 1 of subpart 2 of part A of title IV of the 
4
Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070a– 
5

6
generation or low-income students with disabilities

to prepare for, enroll in, and graduate from institu-
8
