13
(A) these financial institutions have, as a

effects, and therefore have a responsibility to

19
Federal benefits not available to other types of

the onset of the COVID-19 health crisis;

(v) other actions to ensure financial

stability and mitigate risk to the financial 
12
system as a whole.

15
environmentally sustainable investment needs of the 
16
local communities in which they are chartered.
