SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. 
1
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Child welfare service providers, both individ-
3
uals and organizations, have the inherent, funda-
4
mental, and inalienable right to free exercise of reli-
5
gion protected by the United States Constitution. 
6
(2) The right to free exercise of religion for 
7
child welfare service providers includes the freedom 
8
to refrain from conduct that conflicts with their sin-
9
cerely held religious beliefs. 
10
(3) Most States provide government-funded 
11
child welfare services through various charitable, re-
12
ligious, and private organizations. 
13
(4) Religious organizations, in particular, have 
14
a lengthy and distinguished history of providing 
15
child welfare services that predates government in-
16
volvement. 
17
(5) Religious organizations have long been and 
18
should continue contracting with and receiving 
19
grants from governmental entities to provide child 
20
welfare services. 
21
(6) Religious organizations cannot provide cer-
22
tain child welfare services, such as foster-care or 
23
adoption placements, without receiving a government 
24
contract, grant or license.

•HR 897 IH
(7) Religious organizations display particular 
1
excellence when providing child welfare services. 
2
(8) Children and families benefit greatly from 
3
the child welfare services provided by religious orga-
4
nizations. 
5
(9) Governmental entities and officials admin-
6
istering federally funded child welfare services in 
7
some States, including Massachusetts, California, Il-
8
linois, and the District of Columbia, have refused to 
9
contract with religious organizations that are unable, 
10
due to sincerely held religious beliefs or moral con-
11
victions, to provide a child welfare service that con-
12
flicts, or under circumstances that conflict, with 
13
those beliefs or convictions; and that refusal has 
14
forced many religious organizations to end their long 
15
and distinguished history of excellence in the provi-
16
sion of child welfare services. 
17
(10) Ensuring that religious organizations can 
18
continue to provide child welfare services will benefit 
19
the children and families that receive those federally 
20
funded services. 
21
(11) States also provide government-funded 
22
child welfare services through individual child wel-
23
fare service providers with varying religious and 
24
moral convictions.

•HR 897 IH
(12) Many individual child welfare service pro-
1
viders maintain sincerely held religious beliefs or 
2
moral convictions that relate to their work and 
3
should not be forced to choose between their liveli-
4
hood and adherence to those beliefs or convictions. 
5
(13) Because governmental entities provide 
6
child welfare services through many charitable, reli-
7
gious, and private organizations, each with varying 
8
religious beliefs or moral convictions, and through 
9
diverse individuals with varying religious beliefs or 
10
moral convictions, the religiously impelled inability 
11
of some religious organizations or individuals to pro-
12
vide certain services will not have a material effect 
13
on a person’s ability to access federally funded child 
14
welfare services. 
15
(14) The activities of funding and admin-
16
istering these child welfare services substantially af-
17
fect interstate commerce. 
18
(15) Taking adverse actions against child wel-
19
fare service providers that are unable, due to their 
20
sincerely held religious beliefs or moral convictions, 
21
to provide certain services (or provide services under 
22
certain circumstances) substantially affects inter-
23
state commerce.

17
with the sincerely held religious beliefs or moral con-
18
victions of the provider. 
19
(2) To protect child welfare service providers’ 
20
exercise of religion and to ensure that governmental 
21
entities will not be able to force those providers, ei-
22
ther directly or indirectly, to discontinue all or some 
23
of their child welfare services because they decline to 
24
provide a child welfare service that conflicts, or
