RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the designation of the second Monday 
in October as ‘‘Indigenous Peoples’ Day’’ to celebrate 
and honor indigenous peoples and their shared history 
and culture. 
Whereas ‘‘Indigenous Peoples’ Day’’ was first proposed in 
1977, by a delegation of Native Nations to the United

Whereas currently over 50 municipalities and 10 States cele-
brate ‘‘Indigenous Peoples’ Day’’ on the second Monday

ognized by some cities and States around the country on 
the second Monday of October; 
Whereas Columbus Day does not currently provide an oppor-
tunity to reflect on the colonization of North America by 
Europeans; 
Whereas prior to colonization, indigenous peoples lived and 
flourished in the Americas for thousands of years; 
Whereas the European colonization of North America led to 
the suppression, forced assimilation, and genocide of in-
digenous peoples and their cultures; 
Whereas the House of Representatives recognizes and values 
the vast contributions made to the United States by in-
digenous peoples’ knowledge, science, philosophy, arts, 
and culture; 
Whereas it is the responsibility of the House of Representa-
tives to foster inclusivity, racial equity, and justice for all 
people and oppose systemic practices that perpetuate op-
pression; 
Whereas the House of Representatives recognizes its respon-
sibility to honor the Nation’s indigenous roots, history, 
traditions, and cultural contributions; and 
Whereas the second Monday in October would be an appro-
priate date to designate as ‘‘Indigenous Peoples’ Day’’: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) honors and recognizes the unique contribu-

tions indigenous peoples have made to the United

States of America;
