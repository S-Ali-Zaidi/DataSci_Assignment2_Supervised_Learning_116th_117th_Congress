RESOLUTION 
Calling for an end to escalating violence in the Nagorno- 
Karabakh enclave, for each side to return to the peace 
process, and for external parties to cease their support 
for and interference in the conflict. 
Whereas, on September 27, 2020, the most significant out-
break of violence since the signing of the 1994 cease-fire 
agreement began across the line of contact in Nagorno- 
Karabakh between Armenian and Azerbaijani forces; 
Whereas military operations by each side have included the 
exchange of air strikes, rocket attacks, and artillery fire, 
resulting in the deaths of soldiers and civilians, the 
wounding of hundreds more, and causing needless suf-
fering to families and communities in the conflict zone;

Whereas both Armenia and Azerbaijan have declared martial 
law, mobilized their armed forces, and called up reserve 
forces, further escalating tensions; 
Whereas the conflict has the potential to escalate into proxy 
warfare among regional powers, including Turkey and 
Russia, which would further entrench the conflict, in-
crease risk of civilian harm, and threaten long-term peace 
and stability in the region; 
Whereas Russia maintains close economic ties to both Arme-
nia and Azerbaijan and provides weapons, other support, 
and military guarantees to Armenia, which is a member 
of the Russian-led Collective Security Treaty Organiza-
tion (CSTO); 
Whereas the United States serves as a neutral co-chair of the 
Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe 
(OSCE) Minsk Group, along with France and Russia, 
and the Presidents of the Co-Chair countries have urged 
the parties to return to a ceasefire and substantive nego-
tiations as soon as possible; 
Whereas the United States remains committed to working 
with each side through the OSCE Minsk Group to settle 
the conflict peacefully and sustainably; 
Whereas both Azerbaijan and Armenia are North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization (NATO) Partnership for Peace 
countries, which made a commitment to increase sta-
bility, diminish threats to peace, and build strengthened 
security relationships among NATO and non-member 
countries in the Euro-Atlantic area; and 
Whereas a long-standing conflict like the one between Arme-
nia and Azerbaijan must be solved through a political
