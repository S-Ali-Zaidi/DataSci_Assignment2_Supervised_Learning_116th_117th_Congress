SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Across the United States, there are hun-
3
dreds of thousands of children younger than 18 
4
years old who are working in the agricultural indus-
5
try. It is difficult to know exactly how many children 
6
are performing the grueling work that is required to 
7
plant, pick, process, and pack the food that people 
8
eat every day. 
9
(2) For farmworkers, many of whom are immi-
10
grants, all of whom are poor and some of whom are 
11
undocumented, it is challenging to capture accurate 
12
data that reflects both the percentage of children 
13
working in one of the nation’s most dangerous occu-
14
pations, as well as the scope of the work that they 
15
are engaged in. One thing that is notable is that un-
16
like virtually every other job in the labor market, 
17
Congress has made exceptions to allow children to 
18
lawfully work in this industry. 
19
(3) Historically, children have been permitted to 
20
work in agriculture at younger ages, for longer 
21
hours and under more hazardous conditions than 
22
other working children. Like most other agricultural 
23
workers, they remain excluded from basic protec-
24
tions provided to workers in other industries under 
25
Federal employment laws. Even where protections 
26
22:28 Jun 26, 2019
H3394
3 
•HR 3394 IH
exist under Federal law, they are seldom ever en-
1
forced. 
2
(4) Allowing children to engage in agricultural 
3
work from a young age can result in long-term nega-
4
tive consequences, especially when the child worker 
5
is not employed on a family farm where family mem-
6
bers take precautions for their children and family 
7
members. Working in agriculture as a child can re-
8
sult in an early end to childhood, and long hours 
9
worked at unfair and unlawful wages can pose risks 
10
to their overall health and lives. 
11
(5) Child farmworkers suffer work-related fa-
12
talities at over four times the rate of other young 
13
workers, often because exceptions are made that 
14
allow farmworker children to operate heavy, dan-
15
gerous equipment and to be exposed to other haz-
16
ards. Yet, great efforts have been taken to strictly 
17
limit the possibility of children in other industries 
18
from engaging in dangerous work activities or jobs. 
19
The demands imposed by doing agricultural work, 
20
coupled with the low pay and poor working condi-
21
tions, result in shocking drop-out rates from school. 
22
Aside from these risks, farmworker girls are excep-
23
tionally vulnerable to sexual abuse and harassment 
24
22:28 Jun 26, 2019
H3394
4 
•HR 3394 IH
by supervisors, company owners, crew leaders, co- 
1
workers and others. 
2
(6) While the focus of this Act is on improving 
3
the health and safety for all children engaged in ag-
4
ricultural labor, primarily through strengthened gen-
5
eral wage and hour protections, the high rates of 
6
workplace sexual violence against farmworker women 
7
and girls should not be ignored, particularly given 
8
that they are susceptible to this violence due to the 
9
overall lack of workplace protections available to 
10
them.
