SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
1
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds as follows: 
2
(1) Many means-tested public assistance pro-
3
grams limit eligibility for benefits on the basis of the 
4
assets of a family, such as savings and other re-
5
sources. Such asset limits impede the ability of 
6
needy families to improve their financial cir-
7
cumstances and thereby reduce their dependence on 
8
public assistance programs. 
9
(2) Restricting eligibility for public assistance 
10
programs on the basis of assets negatively affects 
11
the financial security of low-income families. For ex-
12
ample, to avoid losing eligibility for public assistance 
13
under an asset limit, a family may avoid mainstream 
14
financial services such as bank accounts, or refrain 
15
from acquiring and saving resources that would en-
16
able the family to weather an unanticipated expense. 
17
(3) The risk that people who don’t need public 
18
assistance will take advantage of public assistance 
19
programs in the absence of asset limits is low, in 
20

part because most applicants for public assistance 
1
have very few assets, must meet strict work require-
2
ments, and usually may only participate in a pro-
3
gram for a limited time. 
4
(4) Evidence from States that have eliminated 
5
asset limits suggests that the administrative cost 
6
savings associated with the elimination of asset lim-
7
its outweigh any increases in payments made to 
8
beneficiaries. 
9
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
10
gress that certain federally funded means-tested public as-
11
sistance programs should not utilize asset limits to restrict 
12
eligibility for assistance under those programs.
