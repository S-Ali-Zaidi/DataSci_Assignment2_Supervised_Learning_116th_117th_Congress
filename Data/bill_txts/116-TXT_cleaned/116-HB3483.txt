The Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) On April 15, 1947, future Hall of Famer 
8
Jackie Robinson changed the landscape of the Na-
9
tional Pastime and the Nation itself when he 
10
stepped onto the grass at Ebbets Field as the start-
11
ing first baseman for the Brooklyn Dodgers and the 
12
first African-American to play Major League Base-
13
ball in the modern era. 
14
(2) On July 5, 1947, future Hall of Famer 
15
Larry Doby took his first at-bat for the Cleveland 
16
Indians, ending the color barrier in the American 
17
League forever. 
18
(3) The integration of Major League Baseball 
19
in 1947 is recognized today as a seminal moment in
