SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE 
1
DESIGN-BUILD CONSTRUCTION METHOD FOR 
2
DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS CON-
3
STRUCTION PROJECTS. 
4
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following find-
5
ings: 
6
(1) The Inspector General of the Department of 
7
Veterans Affairs found that, in the Aurora, Colo-
8
rado, replacement medical center project, the De-
9
partment decided to change its acquisition strategy 
10
from traditional design-bid-build to integrated-design 
11
and construct in the fourth year of the project, 
12
which was too late for the integrated design-con-
13
struction firm to provide effective input into the de-
14
sign. 
15
(2) In response to deficiencies in the Depart-
16
ment’s management of the Aurora, Colorado, re-
17
placement medical center project and in order to 
18
prevent reoccurrence of such deficiencies in the fu-
19
ture, Congress enacted section 8103 of title 38, 
20
United States Code, which mandates that an appro-
21
priate non-Department Federal entity take over 
22
management of future super construction projects of 
23
the Department, including project design, acquisi-
24
tion, construction, and contract changes.

(3) It has been the policy of the Federal Gov-
1
ernment since the enactment of the Clinger-Cohen 
2
Act of 1996 (Public Law 104–106) that design-build 
3
shall be used when appropriate circumstances are 
4
present. 
5
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
6
gress that— 
7
(1) the unsuccessful use of the integrated-de-
8
sign and construct acquisition method in the Aurora, 
9
Colorado, replacement medical center project should 
10
not be interpreted to mean that design-build, as de-
11
scribed in section 3309 of title 41, United States 
12
Code, is unsuitable for construction projects of the 
13
Department of Veterans Affairs; and 
14
(2) when used properly by adequately trained 
15
acquisition and construction management personnel 
16
and in the appropriate circumstances, design-build is 
17
an effective construction acquisition method for the 
18
Department of Veterans Affairs, which has been 
19
demonstrated to reduce change orders, decrease the 
20
duration between design completion and beneficial 
21
occupancy, and increase warranty protections.

tion 3309 of title 41. 
10
‘‘(2) In the case of a super construction project for 
11
which a non-Department Federal entity provides project 
12
management services under section 8103(e) of this title, 
13
the Secretary shall not discourage the entity from using 
14
the procedures established in section 3309 of title 41.’’.

(b) COVERED CERTIFICATION PROGRAM.—Section 
16
