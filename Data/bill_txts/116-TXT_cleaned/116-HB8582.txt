‘‘(a) THRESHOLD REVIEW.—For each category of

covered entities listed in section 701(5), the Adminis-
6
trator— 
7
‘‘(1) in 2025, and once every 5 years thereafter, 
8
shall review the threshold for electricity or useful 
9
thermal energy output production that is used to de-
10
fine covered entities in such category; and 
11
‘‘(2) may by rule lower such threshold after 
12
consideration of— 
13
‘‘(A) greenhouse gas emissions from cov-
14
ered entities in such category, and from other 
15
entities of the same type that produce less elec-
16
tricity or useful thermal energy output (includ-
17
ing greenhouse gas emission sources that com-
18
mence operation after the date of enactment of 
19
this title that are not covered entities); and 
20
‘‘(B) whether greater greenhouse gas emis-
21
sion reductions can be cost-effectively achieved 
22
by lowering the applicable threshold.

‘‘(b) DESIGNATED REPRESENTATIVES.—The regula-
24
tions promulgated under section 729 shall require that

14
affecting the authority of the Federal Energy Regu-
