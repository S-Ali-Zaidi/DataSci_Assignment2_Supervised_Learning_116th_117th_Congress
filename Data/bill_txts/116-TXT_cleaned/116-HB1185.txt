A BILL 
To provide paid family and medical leave benefits to certain 
individuals, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Family and Medical 
4
Insurance Leave Act’’ or the ‘‘FAMILY Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. 
6
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) In more than two-thirds of families with 
8
children, 
all 
adults 
in 
the 
household 
work. 
9
43,500,000 people provide unpaid care to family 
10
members, and six of every ten family caregivers re-
11
port working at jobs unrelated to their care respon-
12
sibilities. More than half report working full time. 
13
An estimated 36,000,000 working age adults live 
14
with a family member who has a disability. Without 
15

•HR 1185 IH
paid family and medical leave, many workers are un-
1
able to take time away from work to care for new-
2
born children, parents and relatives with serious 
3
health conditions, or themselves. 
4
(2) Both women and men need to be able to 
5
take time off work to participate in the care of their 
6
children, in the care of seriously ill family members, 
7
and to address their own serious health conditions. 
8
Yet, a mere 17 percent of civilian workers in the 
9
United States have access to paid family leave 
10
through their employers, and fewer than 40 percent 
11
have access to short-term disability insurance pro-
12
vided by their employer to use for their own ill-
13
nesses. 
14
(3) Many workers cannot afford to take unpaid 
15
time off work to provide care. According to the De-
16
partment of Labor, nearly half of workers who quali-
17
fied for leave under the Family and Medical Leave 
18
Act of 1993 (FMLA) in 2011 were unable to take 
19
the leave because they could not afford to take time 
20
off without pay. Six in ten workers who took par-
21
tially paid or unpaid leave reported difficulty making 
22
ends meet; half of these workers were forced to cut 
23
their leaves short due to financial constraints. 
24

•HR 1185 IH
(4) Only 17 percent of all workers had access 
1
to paid family leave in 2017 and it was available to 
2
only 5 percent of people working in the lowest pay-
3
ing jobs. Workers who lack paid family and medical 
4
leave face lost wages or even job loss when they miss 
5
work because of their own illness or to care for an 
6
ill child or parent. In this way, access to paid family 
7
and medical leave plays a critical role in families’ ef-
8
forts to maintain employment and economic security. 
9
(5) Caregiving has a high value but also comes 
10
at a high cost for family caregivers. Working fami-
11
lies in the United States lose an estimated 
12
$20,600,000,000 in wages each year due to lack of 
13
access to paid family and medical leave. 
14
(6) The estimated value of unpaid family care 
15
provided in 2013 was $470,000,000,000. Family 
16
caregivers face financial, physical and emotional 
17
hardships, and in many cases their careers, incomes, 
18
and retirement security suffer because of their fam-
19
ily responsibilities. 
20
(7) The average worker age 50 and older who 
21
leaves the workforce to care for an elderly parent 
22
loses more than $300,000 in earnings and retire-
23
ment income. Working caregivers should not have to 
24
00:07 Feb 26, 2019
H1185
5 
•HR 1185 IH
risk their family’s economic security to fulfill their 
1
caregiving obligations. 
2
(8) By 2030, one in five United States resi-
3
dents will have reached retirement age, and individ-
4
uals 65 and older are projected to outnumber those 
5
under the age of 18 for the first time in the history 
6
of the United States. The number of potential family 
7
caregivers for each person age 80 and older will fall 
8
from 7:1 in 2010 to fewer than 3:1 by 2050. Addi-
9
tionally, the number of people with chronic condi-
10
tions is expected to reach nearly 160,000,000 by 
11
2020. Many of these individuals will at some point 
12
require family care, and for older workers still in the 
13
workforce, many will need time off at some point to 
14
address serious health conditions. 
15
(9) Ensuring working family caregivers have 
16
paid family leave to care for seriously ill or injured 
17
older adult relatives could drive down Medicare costs 
18
by decreasing recurrences of ailments and re-admit-
19
tance into hospitals. The implementation of Califor-
20
nia’s paid family leave insurance program, which has 
21
been in effect since 2004, accounted for an 11 per-
22
cent relative decline in elder nursing home usage. 
23
(10) Only half of cancer patients and survivors 
24
report having access to paid leave, and only four in 
25
00:07 Feb 26, 2019
H1185
6 
•HR 1185 IH
ten caregivers of those patients are able to take paid 
1
leave to help with completing treatment, managing 
2
symptoms and side effects, and caring for their own 
3
health. 
4
(11) Many workers are forced to quickly return 
5
to work after the birth or arrival of a child because 
6
they have no access to paid family and medical 
7
leave. Only half of new mothers take paid leave of 
8
any duration after the birth of their first child, and 
9
among women with less than a high school education 
10
the figure is less than 20 percent—a rate that has 
11
not changed in more than half a century. Access to 
12
paid leave is even rarer for men, as just 9 percent 
13
of private sector workers are employed at worksites 
14
that offer paid paternity leave to all male employees. 
15
Three out of every four fathers in white-collar jobs 
16
took one week or less of leave after their most recent 
17
child was born, and nearly 60 percent of low-income 
18
fathers reported taking zero weeks of paid time 
19
away from work after the birth or adoption of a 
20
child. 
21
(12) When new mothers have no choice but to 
22
return to work without taking leave, children can ex-
23
perience a variety of negative outcomes including 
24
higher rates of infant mortality, lower rates of 
25
00:07 Feb 26, 2019
H1185
7 
•HR 1185 IH
breastfeeding, and lower rates of immunization. Cali-
1
fornia’s paid leave program improved child health 
2
outcomes, particularly for economically vulnerable 
3
children, and improved breastfeeding and vaccina-
4
tion rates. 
5
(13) New mothers without sufficient leave expe-
6
rience a higher incidence of physical and mental 
7
health concerns, and new mothers with fewer than 
8
12 weeks of leave experience elevated risks of 
9
postpartum depression. California’s paid family leave 
10
insurance program increased the number of weeks of 
11
leave that women take after childbirth, with larger 
12
effects among women in jobs that do not provide 
13
paid leave. New Jersey’s paid leave program, which 
14
has been in effect since 2009, was strongly associ-
15
ated with improvements in new mothers’ physical 
16
health. 
17
(14) A gender-inclusive nationwide paid family 
18
and medical leave program would address persistent 
19
sex discrimination in the utilization of leave benefits 
20
and reduce the disparity between women and men 
21
regarding who takes time off from work to fulfill 
22
caregiving duties. 
23
(15) Many men would like to be more involved 
24
in caregiving and report greater work-family conflict 
25
00:07 Feb 26, 2019
H1185

•HR 1185 IH
than ever before. When fathers in two-parent, oppo-
1
site-sex households take paid leave, their involvement 
2
in caregiving and domestic chores increases, sup-
3
porting equal co-parenting and making it easier for 
4
women to return to the workforce. In California, 
5
men’s use of the State’s paid family leave insurance 
6
program to care for a new child has more than dou-
7
bled since the program’s implementation. In Rhode 
8
Island, which implemented its program in 2014, men 
9
took leave at higher rates in the program’s first year 
10
than other State programs’ first year. 
11
(16) Paid family and medical leave promotes 
12
families’ financial security and independence, in-
13
creases worker retention, and promotes savings for 
14
taxpayers. Women who take paid leave after a 
15
child’s birth are more likely to be in the labor force 
16
in the 9 to 12 months after a child’s birth and to 
17
earn higher wages in the year following their child’s 
18
birth. Both men and women who take paid leave 
19
after a child’s birth are less likely to receive SNAP 
20
benefits and other public assistance in the year fol-
21
lowing a child’s birth. 
22
(17) Without paid medical leave, workers who 
23
are ill or injured may return to work before being 
24
fully recovered, thus making them susceptible to a 
25
00:07 Feb 26, 2019
H1185
9 
•HR 1185 IH
relapse or recurrence, and potentially placing addi-
1
tional burdens on the health care system. When a 
2
job requires physical stamina or ability, individuals 
3
who return to work too early may put themselves or 
4
others in jeopardy. 
5
(18) A social insurance model of providing paid 
6
family leave pioneered and implemented by the 
7
States of California, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and 
8
New York, and recently passed in the District of Co-
9
lumbia, Washington, and Massachusetts, has worked 
10
well for workers, their families, and employers. The 
11
overwhelming majority of California employers re-
12
port that the State’s program had a positive or neu-
13
tral effect on their business, and businesses surveyed 
14
in New Jersey and Rhode Island reported having lit-
15
tle trouble adjusting to the State’s law. 
16
(19) When workers can care for themselves and 
17
their loved ones, employers experience positive im-
18
pacts. In California, where a family leave insurance 
19
program has existed for more than a decade, work-
20
ers in low-wage, high-turnover industries are much 
21
more likely to return to their jobs after using the 
22
program, and 9 out of 10 businesses report positive 
23
or neutral effects on profitability and productivity. 
24
00:07 Feb 26, 2019
H1185
10 
•HR 1185 IH
(20) High-profile employers are increasingly 
1
recognizing the value of providing paid leave in re-
2
duced turnover and improved employee morale and 
3
productivity, yet access to paid leave remains low 
4
across most industries, particularly for low- and 
5
middle-income workers. Some of the fastest-growing 
6
occupations, such as home health care and service 
7
jobs, typically pay low wages and are particularly 
8
unlikely to offer paid leave benefits. As of 2018, 
9
more than 75 businesses and business leaders have 
10
endorsed the need for a strong, inclusive national 
11
paid leave policy. 
12
(21) Californians have filed nearly 2,810,000 
13
paid family leave claims between the implementation 
14
of the State’s paid family leave program in 2004 
15
and November 2017. In New Jersey, more than 
16
255,000 claims have been filed over the more than 
17
7 years of the program’s existence, and in Rhode Is-
18
land, nearly 34,000 claims were filed in the pro-
19
grams first 3 years. These claims represent valuable 
20
care for new children and seriously ill loved ones. 
21
(22) Social Security is the Nation’s primary so-
22
cial insurance system, with the most complete record 
23
of workers’ earnings history. It provides retirement 
24
assistance and disability benefits currently and, 
25
00:07 Feb 26, 2019
H1185
11 
•HR 1185 IH
since its creation in 1934, the programs the Social 
1
Security Administration administers have been up-
2
dated multiple times to reflect the changing needs of 
3
the population, families and the workforce. The sys-
4
tem needs to be changed again now—with appro-
5
priate investments to meet the agency’s needs—to 
6
reflect today’s realities. 
7
(23) Researchers at Brandeis University esti-
8
mate that, following enactment of this Act, the share 
9
of families falling into financial hardship (earnings 
10
below 200 percent of the Federal poverty line) as a 
11
result of taking 12 weeks of unpaid leave would be 
12
reduced by more than 81 percent. 
13
(24) Without a national paid leave policy, the 
14
United States is missing out on substantial economic 
15
activity, which has been estimated at approximately 
16
$500,000,000,000 by the Department of Labor, as 
17
women in particular are held back from partici-
18
pating in the workforce in equal shares. 
19
(25) A national paid family and medical leave 
20
program has the support of more than eight in ten 
21
voters across demographic and party lines. 
22
(b) PURPOSE.—It is the purpose of this Act— 
23

working parents and workers in dual-earner families,

(2) to provide workers with a reasonable level 
3
of wage replacement during time away from work 
4
for a serious health condition, for the birth or adop-
5

6
parent who has a serious health condition, for the 
7
care of an injured servicemember, or for qualifying 
8
exigencies arising from the deployment of a service-
9
member; 
10
(3) to address sex discrimination, promote the 
11
goal of equal employment opportunity for women 
12
and men, and to provide relief when employers vio-
13
late the law; and 
14
(4) to accomplish the purposes described in 
15
paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) in a manner that ac-
16
commodates the legitimate interests of employers.
