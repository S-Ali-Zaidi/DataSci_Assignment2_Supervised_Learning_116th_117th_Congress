A BILL 
To establish a congressionally chartered seaway development 
corporation in the Arctic, consistent with customary 
international law, with the intention of uniting Arctic 
nations in a cooperative Arctic shipping union, where 
voluntary collective maritime shipping fees will help fund 
the infrastructural and environmental demands of safe 
and reliable shipping in the region. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Shipping and Environ-
2
mental Arctic Leadership Act’’ or the ‘‘SEAL Act’’. 
3
SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS. 
4
In this Act: 
5
(1) ARCTIC.—The term ‘‘Arctic’’ has the mean-
6
ing given the term in section 112 of the Arctic Re-
7
search and Policy Act of 1984 (15 U.S.C. 4111). 
8
(2) ARCTIC
SEA
ROUTES.—The term ‘‘Arctic 
9
Sea Routes’’ means the international Northern Sea 
10
Route, the Transpolar Sea Route, and the North-
11
west Passage. 
12
SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
13
Congress finds the following: 
14
(1) The Arctic seas have historically been con-
15
sidered impassable and impractical maritime routes, 
16
but diminishing Arctic sea ice, better icebreaking 
17
technology, and global demand for Arctic resources 
18
has opened up opportunity for international trade 
19
routes through Arctic Ocean waters. 
20
(2) According to the National Oceanic and At-
21
mospheric Administration, over the last 20 years at-
22
mospheric temperatures have increased at a rate at 
23
least 3 times the global average, and as of 2011 sea 
24
ice thickness was 42 percent below what it was in 
25

•HR 3020 IH
1979. If trends continue, summers may produce ice- 
1
free waters in the Arctic Ocean by the late 2030s. 
2
(3) The Bering Strait is experiencing signifi-
3
cant increases in international traffic from vessels 
4
using the Arctic Sea Routes. Increases in inter-
5
national traffic are projected to continue. 
6
(4) While the Arctic Council’s agreements on 
7
search and rescue, spill prevention and response, 
8
and initiatives through the International Maritime 
9
Organization to bring about a mandatory polar code 
10
are significant, little or no cooperation yet exists in 
11
the Arctic region to bring about needed maritime in-
12
frastructure, nor do Arctic coastal states and user 
13
states cooperate in establishing common seaway ad-
14
ministration. International coordination and invest-
15
ment in infrastructure for shipping routes, ice-
16
breaker service and refuge, ports, spill prevention 
17
and response, salvage, and LNG bunkering, would 
18
be collectively beneficial for all associated states, the 
19
environment, and global commerce. 
20
(5) Trans-Arctic shipping brings substantial 
21
commercial benefits. Shipping distance between Eu-
22
rope and Asia could be reduced by 4,500 nautical 
23
miles, saving a week’s time and 40 percent in freight 
24
shipping distances compared to alternative routes. 
25

•HR 3020 IH
Through a voluntary tariff model, user nations from 
1
the remainder of the world can be invited to share 
2
with Arctic nations the capital and operating costs 
3
necessary for safe and reliable infrastructure in the 
4
Arctic Ocean and its approaches. 
5
(6) As this new frontier emerges, the United 
6
States should assume leadership to ensure safe, se-
7
cure, and reliable Arctic seaway development, and 
8
further to ensure that the Arctic becomes a place of 
9
international cooperation rather than competition or 
10
conflict. 
11
(7) Setting precedent for cooperative infrastruc-
12
ture investment and greater reliability in domestic 
13
and international shipping is the St. Lawrence Sea-
14
way between the United States and Canada, which 
15
links the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean. The 
16
Seaway operates in internal waters, rather than 
17
international waters, but offers ship operators a co-
18
ordinated suite of services, similar to what is needed 
19
in the Arctic Ocean and its approaches. 
20
(8) The St. Lawrence Seaway Development 
21
Corporation, established in 1954, is a model for a 
22
United States Government corporation that con-
23
structs, operates, and maintains sea passage infra-
24
structure in water bodies shared with another na-

tion. It corresponds with its Canadian counterpart, 
1
the St. Lawrence Seaway Management Corporation. 
2
In 2010 the Great Lakes-Seaway system gen-
3
erated— 
4
(A) 226,833 United States and Canadian 
5
jobs; 
6
(B) $33,600,000,000 in business revenue 
7
from maritime activity; and 
8
(C) $4,600,000,000 in Federal, State, pro-
9
vincial, and local tax revenue from maritime ac-
10
tivity. 
11
(9) In 2012 the Russian Duma passed legisla-
12
tion to create a single management agency called the 
13
Northern Sea Route Administration, to manage all 
14
infrastructural and navigational services across what 
15
Russia claims to be its Arctic territorial waters. This 
16
is a claim the United States and many other nations 
17
do not recognize. Russia is investing heavily into 
18
Northern Sea Route infrastructure, anticipating an 
19
increase in cargo transport from 1,800,000 tons in 
20
2010 to 64,000,000 tons by 2020. The Russian 
21
Northern Sea Route Administration charges escort 
22
fees for international cargo ships as high as 
23
$500,000, and aims to collect a share of revenues 
24
that might otherwise be paid as tariffs on the Suez

Canal where collections totaled $5,300,000,000 in 
1
2017. 
2
(10) The Russian Federation has considered 
3
legislation to require all energy traffic on the North-
4
ern Sea Route to be carried by Russian-flagged 
5
ships. 
6
(11) Rising transit in United States Arctic re-
7
gion waters necessitates a management agency and 
8
infrastructure investment in a transportation sys-
9
tem. As identified in the Ten-Year Prioritization of 
10
Infrastructure Needs in the United States Arctic 
11
prepared by the United States Committee on the 
12
Marine Transportation System Arctic Transpor-
13
tation Integrated Action Team for the United States 
14
Department of Transportation, there is a significant 
15
infrastructure gap in the Arctic in the areas of— 
16
(A) navigable waterways, such as waterway 
17
coordination with international stakeholders; 
18
(B) physical infrastructure, such as infra-
19
structure around Port Clarence and Port of 
20
Nome in Alaska to support commercial activity; 
21
(C) informational infrastructure, such as 
22
up-to-date nautical charts and electronic aids to 
23
navigation; 
24
02:24 Jun 08, 2019
H3020

•HR 3020 IH
(D) MTS Response Services, such as emer-
1
gency response and rescue capabilities; and 
2
(E) vessel operations, such as United 
3
States icebreaking capabilities. 
4
(12) The Arctic offers economic value to the 
5
United States through commercial shipping and 
6
international trade routes, energy, mining, commer-
7
cial fishing, tourism, and tug and barge operations. 
8
The Arctic offers environmental and cultural value 
9
through ecological significance, unique wildlife, in-
10
digenous peoples and Alaskan communities, and sci-
11
entific research. The Arctic offers security value to 
12
the United States as a way to move United States 
13
vessels and forces between the world’s oceans, and 
14
through other waters. While the United States does 
15
not support mandatory tariffs in this region, it does 
16
not currently have a way to collect voluntary tariffs 
17
for providing assistance to vessels crossing through 
18
the Bering Strait or the Arctic Ocean. 
19
(13) Reinvesting into infrastructural and envi-
20
ronmental demands with funds collected from inter-
21
national shipping fees will be essential to the long- 
22
term viability of the Arctic. 
23
02:24 Jun 08, 2019

•HR 3020 IH
(14) Environmental protection of the Arctic 
1
takes the form of pollution prevention, clean-up, and 
2
accident response. 
3
(15) Arctic prevention and clean-up involves all 
4
feasible efforts to remove or mitigate pollutants from 
5
the environment. Arctic ecosystems are more suscep-
6
tible to biological damage from pollutants than more 
7
temperate climates. Existing removable hazards, 
8
such as dumped radioactive waste and other toxic 
9
substances, must be handled. 
10
(16) Arctic pollution prevention takes collective 
11
adherence to regulations and best practices. United 
12
States leadership on clean practices in the Arctic will 
13
be essential in the ecosystem’s sustainability. Provi-
14
sion of bunkering facilities to enable the use of clean 
15
LNG fuels for ships will strengthen pollution preven-
16
tion. 
17
(17) Environmental response capabilities in the 
18
Arctic are weak, sparse, and have only begun to be 
19
internationally coordinated. Transportation of oil 
20
and gas and maritime traffic is expected to increase 
21
significantly in the Arctic, which will increase the 
22
risk of accidents. The Arctic region is particularly 
23
vulnerable to pollution from oil and gas shipping. 
24
Because oil spills in ice are considerably more com-
25

•HR 3020 IH
plicated to address than oil spills in open waters, ef-
1
fects of oil spills could remain in the region for peri-
2
ods of 50 years or more. In 2010 the International 
3
Maritime Organization passed Guidelines for Ships 
4
Operating in Polar Waters, citing, ‘‘the need to en-
5
sure that all ship systems both are capable of func-
6
tioning effectively under anticipated operating condi-
7
tions and provide adequate levels of safety in acci-
8
dent and emergency situations’’. 
9
(18) In June 2014, the Government Account-
10
ability Office (GAO) reported that the Coast Guard 
11
was experiencing a gap in its heavy icebreaking ca-
12
pacity and was without a heavy icebreaker from 
13
2010 to 2013. Tariffs collected through this system 
14
can help United States public and private icebreaker 
15
capacity grow, and induce additional private invest-
16
ment in marine safety and services. 
17
(19) During the most recent United States 
18
Chairmanship of the Arctic Council, May 2017, the 
19
Arctic Council’s Protection of the Arctic Marine En-
20
vironment Working Group established an Arctic 
21
Shipping Best Practices Information Forum to help 
22
serve as a resource hub of information, guidance, 
23
and guidelines that aid decision-makers involved in 
24
Arctic maritime navigation and those affected by

maritime operations related to the Polar Code. In-
1
surers of Arctic shipping encouraged this Forum to 
2
help bring about safer and more reliable shipping in 
3
the Arctic region, and to reduce losses. This Act is 
4
in support of the same goals.
