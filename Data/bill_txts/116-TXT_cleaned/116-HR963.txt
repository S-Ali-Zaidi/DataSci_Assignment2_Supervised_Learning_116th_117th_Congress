Whereas the 2019 Trafficking in Persons Report of the De-
partment of State relating to the People’s Republic of 
China indicates that— 
(1) authorities in the People’s Republic of China 
have arbitrarily detained more than 1,000,000 ethnic 
Muslims, including Uyghur, ethnic Kazakh, and Kyrgyz 
individuals, in as many as 1,200 ‘‘vocational training cen-
ters’’, which are internment camps designed to erase eth-
nic and religious identities; 
(2) the national household registry system of the 
People’s Republic of China restricts the freedom of rural 
inhabitants to legally change their workplace or resi-
dence, placing the internal migrant population of the 
People’s Republic of China at high risk of forced labor 
in brick kilns, coal mines, and factories; 
(3) the Government of the People’s Republic of 
China subjects Christians and members of other religious 
groups to forced labor in brick kilns, food processing cen-
ters, and factories as part of detention for the purpose 
of ideological indoctrination; and 
(4) the Government of the People’s Republic of 
China provides financial incentives for companies to open 
factories near the internment camps, and local govern-
ments receive additional funds from the Government of 
the People’s Republic of China for each inmate forced to 
work in an internment camp; 
Whereas, in October 2019, Radio Free Asia reported that— 
(1) the Government of the People’s Republic of 
China, as part of its Pair Up and Become Family pro-
gram, assigns male Han Chinese ‘‘relatives’’ to monitor 
the homes of Uyghur families in the Xinjiang Uyghur 
Autonomous Region (XUAR) and to regularly sleep in

the same beds as the wives of men detained in the intern-
ment camps of the region; and 
(2) Uyghur individuals who protest hosting ‘‘rel-
atives’’ or refuse to take part in study sessions or other 
activities with the officials in their homes are subject to 
additional restrictions and may face detention in the in-
ternment camps; 
Whereas, in July 2019, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, 
Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, 
Ireland, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the 
Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Sweden, 
Switzerland, and the United Kingdom jointly condemned 
the arbitrary detention and surveillance of Uyghur indi-
viduals and other minorities in the Xinjiang Uyghur Au-
tonomous Region; 
Whereas, in June 2019, the Independent Tribunal Into 
Forced Organ Harvesting from Prisoners of Conscience 
in China of the China Tribunal found that— 
(1) forced organ harvesting has been carried out for 
years throughout the People’s Republic of China on a sig-
nificant scale, and practitioners of Falun Gong have been 
the main source of organs; and 
(2) the Government of the People’s Republic of 
China has committed crimes against humanity with re-
spect to Uyghur individuals and practitioners of Falun 
Gong; 
Whereas the report of Freedom House entitled ‘‘Freedom in 
the World 2019’’ indicates that— 
(1) women, ethnic and religious minorities, and the 
LGBT community in the People’s Republic of China have 
no opportunity to gain meaningful political representation

and are barred from advancing their interests outside the 
formal structures of the Communist Party of China;

China were surveilled, harassed, physically abused, de-
tained to prevent meetings with certain individuals, and 
had their visas withheld; 
(3) hundreds of Falun Gong practitioners have re-
cently received long prison terms, and many other indi-
viduals were arbitrarily detained in various ‘‘legal edu-
cation’’ facilities, where they were tortured, sometimes fa-
tally, until they abandoned their beliefs; 
(4) limitations on due process in the People’s Re-
public of China, including the excessive use of pretrial de-
tention, are rampant, and an extended crackdown on 
human rights lawyers has weakened the access of defend-
ants to independent legal counsel; and 
(5) individuals attempting to petition the Govern-
ment of the People’s Republic of China with respect to 
grievances or injustices are routinely intercepted in their 
efforts to travel to Beijing, forcefully returned to their 
hometowns, or subjected to extralegal detention in ‘‘black 
jails’’, psychiatric institutions, and other sites at which 
they are at risk of abuse; 
Whereas the annual report of the United States Congres-
sional-Executive Commission on China for 2019 indicates 
that— 
(1) the one-party authoritarian political system of 
the People’s Republic of China deprives the people of the 
People’s Republic of China of their right to meaningfully 
participate in electoral processes and public life generally; 
(2) in 2019, the Government of the People’s Repub-
lic of China detained and prosecuted individuals who 
criticized government officials and policies online and

Uyghur Autonomous Region; and 
(C) the protests in Hong Kong against pro-

cial Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of 
China (referred to in this preamble as the ‘‘Basic Law’’), 
including the freedoms of expression, association, and as-
sembly; 
(4) the Government of the People’s Republic of 
China has used propaganda, disinformation, and censor-
ship in an attempt to shape reporting on the Hong Kong 
protests, attributing the protests to influence by ‘‘foreign 
forces’’, and threatening protesters in Hong Kong; 
(5) officials of the Government of the People’s Re-
public of China and the Communist Party of China con-
tinue to abuse criminal law and police power to punish 
critics and ‘‘maintain stability’’ with the goal of perpet-
uating one-party rule, often targeting human rights advo-
cates, religious believers, and ethnic minority groups; and 
(6) the Government of the People’s Republic of 
China is likely committing crimes against humanity; 
Whereas before the 2008 Summer Olympics were held in Bei-
jing, the Department of State Country Reports on

2018, such repression has intensified since the 2008 
Summer Olympics in Beijing; 
Whereas four Special Rapporteurs of the United Nations

of Hong Kong, as articulated in the Basic Law; 
Whereas the report of the Network of Chinese Human Rights 
Defenders entitled ‘‘Defending Rights in a ‘No Rights
