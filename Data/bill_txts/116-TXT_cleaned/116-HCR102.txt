Whereas, on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization 
declared a pandemic declaration for COVID–19; 
Whereas, on March 13, 2020, the President declared, pursu-
ant to the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et 
seq.), that the COVID–19 pandemic constitutes a na-
tional emergency; 
Whereas in the weeks following such declaration, individuals 
in the United States followed guidance from the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention by avoiding large 
gatherings, practicing social distancing, and practicing 
good hygiene; 
Whereas the employment status of many individuals in the 
United States was changed since this period of the out-
break, bringing great levels of financial stress and suf-
fering to such individuals; 
Whereas the schooling of children and young adults across 
the United States was greatly changed due to the elimi-
nation of in-person classes and the transition to distance 
learning models; 
Whereas, as of May 1, 2020, thousands of individuals in the 
United States have passed away due to COVID–19; 
Whereas the number of deaths in the United States due to 
COVID–19 is likely higher than the reported number due 
to the lack of posthumous testing for COVID–19; 
Whereas communities of color have faced a higher proportion 
of hospitalization and death from COVID–19 due to un-
derlying health conditions; 
Whereas the human cost of the COVID–19 pandemic tran-
scends mere statistics and has resulted in deeply personal 
tragedies for numerous families and communities across 
the United States and around the world;

Whereas due to guidance by the Centers for Disease Control 
and local and State recommendations, individuals in the 
United States are limited in how they could mourn the 
loss of friends, family members, and acquaintances who 
had passed away due to COVID–19; 
Whereas a risk remains for a resurgence of cases of COVID– 
19 until a vaccine is developed, approved, and available 
for use; and 
Whereas the date of September 30, 2020, would be an appro-
priate day to designate as a ‘‘National Day of Mourn-
ing’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate 
1
concurring), That Congress— 
2
(1) supports the designation of a ‘‘National 
3
Day of Mourning’’; 
4
(2) recognizes, commends, and honors the self-
5
less dedication and bravery of fellow Americans as 
6
first responders, health care professionals, transpor-
7
tation personnel, and essential and frontline employ-
8
ees for their actions that saved countless lives in the 
9
United States during the COVID–19 pandemic; 
10
(3) recognizes the sacrifice made by millions of 
11
Americans as they observed stay-at-home orders 
12
from local, State, and national officials to help pre-
13
vent the spread of COVID–19; 
14
(4) recognizes that people of all faiths have 
15
been affected by the COVID–19 pandemic;
