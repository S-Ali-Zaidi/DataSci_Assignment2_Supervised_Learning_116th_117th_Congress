A BILL 
To amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to uphold 
freedom of association protections, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Collegiate Freedom 
4
of Association Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. 
6
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Single-sex social organizations, including so-
8
rorities, fraternities, and private social clubs, have 
9

•HR 3128 IH
existed at institutions of higher education for over 
1
200 years, where they have played, and should con-
2
tinue to play, unique roles in the development of 
3
young women and men by creating sisterhoods and 
4
brotherhoods that foster leadership, promote aca-
5
demic achievement, and encourage civic and campus 
6
involvement through philanthropic activities. 
7
(2) The freedom of association—that is, the 
8
freedom of joining, assembling, and residing with 
9
others—is protected under the First and Fourteenth 
10
Amendments to the Constitution, and allows individ-
11
uals to create spaces that are safe, welcoming, em-
12
powering, enabling, uninhibited, and free. 
13
(3) Single-sex social sororities, fraternities, and 
14
private social clubs meet the requirements for inti-
15
mate and expressive associations protected by the 
16
freedom of association because they are small and 
17
selective, are bound together by friendship, common 
18
interests, and common purpose, and create safe and 
19
empowering spaces for their members. 
20
(4) Some institutions of higher education, which 
21
stand in positions of power and authority over their 
22
students, have increasingly sought to eliminate or re-
23
strict access to single-sex social organizations, which 
24
are designed to nurture, lift, and empower students.

•HR 3128 IH
(5) While the history of equal access in higher 
1
education includes discriminatory actions taken on 
2
the basis of race, religion, national origin, and sex 
3
by students, faculty, staff, and social organizations, 
4
many members of these same groups have taken, 
5
and continue to take actions to make the higher edu-
6
cation community more open and inclusive to all. 
7
(6) While sex discrimination remains a serious 
8
problem in our society, allowing institutions of high-
9
er education to sanction members of sororities, fra-
10
ternities, and private social clubs based solely on the 
11
single-sex status of the organization that the student 
12
belongs to will not solve these problems, is counter-
13
productive, and violates an individual’s constitutional 
14
right to freedom of association. 
15
(b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this Act are as fol-
16
lows: 
17
(1) Protect any student in a single-sex social 
18
organization or any single-sex social organization 
19
from any adverse action by an institution of higher 
20
education based solely on the membership practice of 
21
such organization of limiting membership to only in-
22
dividuals of one sex. 
23
(2) Ensure any student in a single-sex social or-
24
ganization or any single-sex social organization is 
25

•HR 3128 IH
treated equitably in comparison to students at an in-
1
stitution of higher education who do not participate 
2
in single-sex social organizations, or other social or-
3
ganizations at an institution of higher education 
4
that are not single-sex. 
5
(3) Protect the rights of students to freely asso-
6
ciate with and participate in social organizations, in-
7
cluding single-sex social organizations.

9
STUDENTS IN SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS.
