(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:

•HR 1230 IH
(1) In enacting section 107 of the Civil Rights 
1
Act of 1991 (adding section 703(m) of the Civil 
2
Rights Act of 1964), Congress reaffirmed its under-
3
standing that unlawful discrimination is often dif-
4
ficult to detect and prove because those who dis-
5
criminate do not usually admit their discrimination 
6
and often try to conceal their true motives. Section 
7
703(m) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 expressly ap-
8
proved so-called ‘‘mixed motive’’ claims, providing 
9
that an unlawful employment practice is established 
10
when a protected characteristic was a motivating 
11
factor for any employment practice, even though 
12
other factors also motivated the practice. 
13
(2) Congress enacted amendments to other civil 
14
rights statutes, including the Age Discrimination in 
15
Employment Act of 1967 (referred to in this section 
16
as the ‘‘ADEA’’), the Americans with Disabilities 
17
Act of 1990, and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, but 
18
Congress did not expressly amend those statutes to 
19
address mixed motive discrimination. 
20
(3) In the case of Gross v. FBL Financial Serv-
21
ices, Inc., 557 U.S. 167 (2009), the Supreme Court 
22
held that, because Congress did not expressly amend 
23
the ADEA to address mixed motive claims, such 
24
claims were unavailable under the ADEA, and in-
25

•HR 1230 IH
stead the complainant bears the burden of proving 
1
that a protected characteristic or protected activity 
2
was the ‘‘but for’’ cause of an unlawful employment 
3
practice. This decision has significantly narrowed 
4
the scope of protections afforded by the statutes that 
5
were not expressly amended in 1991 to address 
6
mixed motive claims. 
7
(b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this Act are— 
8
(1) to clarify congressional intent that mixed 
9
motive claims shall be available, and that a com-
10
plaining party need not prove that a protected char-
11
acteristic or protected activity was the ‘‘but for’’ 
12
cause of an unlawful employment practice, under the 
13
ADEA and similar civil rights provisions; 
14
(2) to reject the Supreme Court’s reasoning in 
15
the Gross decision that Congress’ failure to amend 
16
any statute other than title VII of the Civil Rights 
17
Act of 1964 (with respect to discrimination claims), 
18
in enacting section 107 of the Civil Rights Act of 
19
1991, suggests that Congress intended to disallow 
20
mixed motive claims under other statutes; and 
21
(3) to clarify that complaining parties— 
22
(A) may rely on any type or form of ad-
23
missible evidence to establish their claims of an 
24
unlawful employment practice;

the protected characteristic or activity was the

sole cause of the employment practice; and

4
ment practice through any available method of 
5
proof or analytical framework.
