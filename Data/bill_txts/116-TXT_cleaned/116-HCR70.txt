(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:

•HCON 70 IH 
(1) Congress has the sole power to declare war 
1
under article I, section 8 of the Constitution. 
2
(2) Congress has not declared war with respect 
3
to, or provided any specific statutory authorization 
4
for, United States military participation in any ac-
5
tivity related to securing, guarding, possessing, prof-
6
iting off of, or developing oil fields in northern 
7
Syria. All of these actions are unconstitutional. 
8
(3) President Donald Trump stated on October 
9
27, 2019 regarding Syria that ‘‘we are leaving sol-
10
diers to secure the oil. Now, we may have to fight 
11
for the oil. That’s OK. Maybe somebody else wants 
12
the oil, in which case they have a hell of a fight.’’ 
13
And that ‘‘it can help us, because we should be able 
14
to take some also. And what I intend to do, perhaps, 
15
is make a deal with an ExxonMobil or one of our 
16
great companies to go in there and do it properly. 
17
Right now it’s not big. It’s big oil underground but 
18
it’s not big oil up top.’’. 
19
(4) The Secretary of Defense, Mark Esper, 
20
stated on October 28, 2019, regarding oil in Syria 
21
that ‘‘US troops will remain positioned in this stra-
22
tegic area to deny ISIS access those vital resources. 
23
And we will respond with overwhelming military 
24
force against any group that threatens the safety of

our forces there.’’. Secretary Esper confirmed that 
1
this includes denying access to the oil from Russian 
2
and Syrian forces. 
3
(5) Oil, natural resources, and land in Syria be-
4
long to the Syrian people, not the United States. 
5
(6) Depriving the Syrian people from the eco-
6
nomic benefit of their natural resources will inhibit 
7
them from rebuilding their country. It is not hu-
8
mane or in the national security interests of the 
9
United States for the Syrian Arab Republic to be an 
10
unstable or failed state. An unstable or failed Syrian 
11
state further proliferates the presence of terrorist or-
12
ganizations like al-Qaeda and ISIS in Syria, and sig-
13
nificantly deteriorates the humanitarian condition of 
14
the Syrian people. 
15
(7) Section 8(c) of the War Powers Resolution 
16
(50 U.S.C. 1547(c)) defines the introduction of 
17
United States Armed Forces to include ‘‘the assign-
18
ment of members of such armed forces to command, 
19
coordinate, participate in the movement of, or ac-
20
company the regular or irregular military forces of 
21
any foreign country or government when such mili-
22
tary forces are engaged, or there exists an imminent 
23
threat that such forces will become engaged, in hos-
24
tilities.’’.
