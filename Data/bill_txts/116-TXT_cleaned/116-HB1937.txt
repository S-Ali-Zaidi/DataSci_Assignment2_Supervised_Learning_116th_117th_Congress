SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds that— 
2
(1)(A) to bring industry and economic develop-
3
ment to Indian communities, Indian Tribes must 
4
overcome a number of barriers, including— 
5
(i) geographical location; 
6
(ii) lack of infrastructure or capacity; 
7
(iii) lack of sufficient collateral and capital; 
8
and 
9
(iv) regulatory bureaucracy relating to— 
10
(I) development; and 
11
(II) access to services provided by the 
12
Federal Government; and 
13
(B) the barriers described in subparagraph (A) 
14
often add to the cost of doing business in Indian 
15
communities; 
16
(2) Indian Tribes— 
17
(A) enact laws and exercise sovereign gov-
18
ernmental powers; 
19
(B) determine policy for the benefit of 
20
Tribal members; and 
21
(C) produce goods and services for con-
22
sumers; 
23
(3) the Federal Government has— 
24
(A) an important government-to-govern-
25
ment relationship with Indian Tribes; and 
26

•HR 1937 IH
(B) a role in facilitating healthy and sus-
1
tainable Tribal economies; 
2
(4) the input of Indian Tribes in developing 
3
Federal policy and programs leads to more meaning-
4
ful and effective measures to assist Indian Tribes 
5
and Indian entrepreneurs in building Tribal econo-
6
mies; 
7
(5)(A) many components of Tribal infrastruc-
8
ture need significant repair or replacement; and 
9
(B) access to private capital for projects in In-
10
dian communities— 
11
(i) may not be available; or 
12
(ii) may come at a higher cost than such 
13
access for other projects; 
14
(6)(A) Federal capital improvement programs, 
15
such as those that facilitate tax-exempt bond financ-
16
ing and loan guarantees, are tools that help improve 
17
or replace crumbling infrastructure; 
18
(B) lack of parity in treatment of an Indian 
19
Tribe as a governmental entity under Federal tax 
20
and certain other regulatory laws impedes, in part, 
21
the ability of Indian Tribes to raise capital through 
22
issuance of tax exempt debt, invest as an accredited 
23
investor, and benefit from other investment incen-

tives accorded to State and local governmental enti-
1
ties; and 
2
(C) as a result of the disparity in treatment of 
3
Indian Tribes described in subparagraph (B), inves-
4
tors may avoid financing, or demand a premium to 
5
finance, projects in Indian communities, making the 
6
projects more costly or inaccessible; 
7
(7) there are a number of Federal loan guar-
8
antee programs available to facilitate financing of 
9
business, energy, economic, housing, and community 
10
development projects in Indian communities, and 
11
those programs may support public-private partner-
12
ships for infrastructure development, but improve-
13
ments and support are needed for those programs 
14
specific to Indian communities to facilitate more ef-
15
fectively private financing for infrastructure and 
16
other urgent development needs; and 
17
(8)(A) most real property held by Indian Tribes 
18
is trust or restricted land that essentially cannot be 
19
held as collateral; and 
20
(B) while creative solutions, such as leasehold 
21
mortgages, have been developed in response to the 
22
problem identified in subparagraph (A), some solu-
23
