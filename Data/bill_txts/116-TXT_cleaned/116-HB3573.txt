A BILL 
To increase research, education, and treatment for cerebral 
cavernous malformations. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Cerebral Cavernous 
4
Malformations Clinical Awareness, Research, and Edu-
5
cation Act of 2019’’ or the ‘‘CCM–CARE Act’’. 
6
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
7
Congress finds as follows: 
8
(1) Cerebral cavernous malformations (referred 
9
to in this section as ‘‘CCM’’), also known as cav-
10

•HR 3573 IH
ernous angioma, or cavernoma, is a devastating 
1
blood vessel disease characterized by vascular lesions 
2
that develop and grow within the brain and spinal 
3
cord. 
4
(2) Detection of CCM lesions is achieved 
5
through costly and specialized medical imaging tech-
6
niques, often not accessible or convenient to patients 
7
who need them. 
8
(3) While CCM is a common type of vascular 
9
anomaly, many individuals are not aware they have 
10
the disease until the onset of serious clinical symp-
11
toms. CCM is often inherited unknowingly. 
12
(4) CCM affects an estimated 600,000 people 
13
in the United States. 
14
(5) Individuals diagnosed with CCM may expe-
15
rience neurological deficits, seizure, stroke, or sud-
16
den death. 
17
(6) Due to limited research, there is currently 
18
no treatment for CCM other than brain and spinal 
19
surgery, and only for certain patients. 
20
(7) There is also a shortage of trained physi-
21
cians to provide skilled and timely diagnosis and ap-
22
propriate treatment for CCM. 
23
(8) While the hereditary form of CCM may 
24
occur among any ethnicity, the presence of a muta-
25

tion called the ‘‘common Hispanic mutation’’, has 
1
passed through 14 or more generations of American 
2
descendants from the original Spanish settlers of the 
3
Southwest in the 1590s. New Mexico has the highest 
4
population density of CCM in the world; Texas, Ari-
5
zona, and Colorado also have high rates of CCM due 
6
to the common Hispanic mutation. 
7
(9) A second mutation (CCM2 Common Dele-
8
tion) originating in the Southeastern United States 
9
before 1800 has increased rates of the illness in 
10
South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mis-
11
sissippi, Louisiana, Texas, Oklahoma, Kentucky, 
12
Kansas, and northern California.
