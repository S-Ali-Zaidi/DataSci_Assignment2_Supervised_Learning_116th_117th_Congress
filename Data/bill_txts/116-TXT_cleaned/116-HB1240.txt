1
continues to increase due to fewer new entrants re-
2
placing retiring fishermen; 
3
(2) there are fewer young or beginning fisher-
4
men entering the commercial fisheries for many rea-
5
sons, including the lack of training, fewer entry level

opportunities, lack of capital, and other barriers to 
7
entry; 
8
(3) without well-trained young or beginning

fishermen to replace those retiring, fishing busi-
10
nesses and vessels will be lost and fishing commu-
11
nities will suffer; 
12
(4) for food security and economic reasons, it is 
13
in the United States national interest to sustainably 
14
harvest United States fishery resources; 
15
(5) United States farmers and ranchers faced 
16
similar difficulties and Congress responded by enact-
17
ing the Beginning Farmers and Ranchers Develop-
18
ment Program administered by the Department of 
19
Agriculture; 
20
(6) the Young Fishermen’s Development Grant 
21
Program established by this Act is modeled after the 
22
successful Department of Agriculture program; and
