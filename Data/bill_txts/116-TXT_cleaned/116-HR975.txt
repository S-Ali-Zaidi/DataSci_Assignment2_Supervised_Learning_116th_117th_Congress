RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for a national day of mourning, a recur-
ring moment of silence in the House of Representatives, 
and a national memorial for American civilians killed 
by COVID–19. 
Whereas the writer and history professor Dr. Micki McElya, 
in her May 15, 2020, perspective piece in the Washington 
Post, highlighted the stark absence of national mourning 
for American lives lost to COVID–19, and the rightful 
ownership of these lives to the American fabric and com-
munity soul;

Whereas the national death toll from the scourge of COVID– 
19 throughout the United States rapidly approaches 
100,000 less than 5 months since its arrival; 
Whereas the United States dutifully and unquestioningly hon-
ors its military dead and those who have died by mass 
violence, through national mourning, prayer, and mo-
ments of silence; 
Whereas the United States understands the importance of 
collective and unified mourning of its dead in times of 
war, and the institution of grief must continue and be ac-
knowledged during this domestic fight; 
Whereas President Donald J. Trump has declared the coun-
try ‘‘at war’’, and that all Americans are ‘‘warriors’’ in 
the face of this common and invisible enemy; 
Whereas the United States is defined by its unified national 
front and has always offered ubiquitous mourning in 
times of national grief and loss, and this pillar of Amer-
ican society must not be lost on the fallen who have 
touched many thousands of lives across our country; 
Whereas the virus has disproportionately impacted specific 
groups of people, namely, immigrants, people of color, 
Native Americans, African Americans, Asian American 
Pacific Islanders, Hispanics, the disabled, the elderly, the 
chronically ill, and the poor and underpaid; 
Whereas when Americans have historically come together to 
address, mourn, and love, this unified spirit, which tran-
scends ideological lines, has always conquered the dead-
liest of threats; and 
Whereas the COVID–19 pandemic calls for this unity, as it 
is the actions of a collaborative and focused government
