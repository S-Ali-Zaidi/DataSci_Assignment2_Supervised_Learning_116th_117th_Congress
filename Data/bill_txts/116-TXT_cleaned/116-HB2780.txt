Congress finds the following:

•HR 2780 IH
(1) From 1999–2017, nearly 400,000 people in 
1
the United States died from opioid overdose. 
2
(2) Overdose deaths from opioids have in-
3
creased nearly six-fold since 1999, killing approxi-
4
mately 130 Americans every day. 
5
(3) Since 2013, there has been a significant in-
6
crease in overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids, 
7
particularly fentanyl. 
8
(4) Opioids, especially synthetic opioids such as 
9
fentanyl, are currently the main driver of drug over-
10
dose deaths, and were involved in nearly 68 percent 
11
of all drug overdose deaths in 2017. 
12
(5) Fentanyl illicitly trafficked into the United 
13
States from abroad is significantly responsible for 
14
the ongoing fentanyl epidemic. 
15
(6) The vast majority of heroin used in the 
16
United States comes from Mexico, and fentanyl gen-
17
erally originates from sources in China. 
18
(7) Illicit opioids are trafficked into the United 
19
States through a variety of routes, including over-
20
land across the Southwest border, and through on-
21
line orders that are shipped by international mail 
22
and express consignment services. 
23
(8) Because these illicit drugs originate almost 
24
exclusively from overseas, stopping these drug flows

requires enhanced foreign policy engagement by the

ment the strategy, should, at a minimum, prioritize the 
1
following:

(2) Strengthening the capacity of partner coun-
7
tries to detect, interdict, and share information on 
8
opioid threats. 
9
(3) Increasing the ability and political will of

ated financial flows, and the use of postal systems 
12
and shipping services to transport illicit opioids, in-
13

15
for drug control to better keep pace with rapidly
