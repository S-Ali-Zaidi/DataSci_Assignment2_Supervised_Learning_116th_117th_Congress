ural Gas Act (15 U.S.C. 717f) with respect to a

pipeline for the transportation of natural gas that

will cross a national scenic trail established under

section 5 of the National Trails System Act (16

mission should specifically consider the conservation

(2) if such certificate, or an action taken pursu-

court should consider the loss of any natural, cul-

(a) APPLICABILITY.— 
16
(1) PIPELINE.—This section applies with re-
17
spect to a pipeline for the transportation of natural 
18
gas that will— 
19
(A) intersect a trail described in paragraph 
20
(2); or 
21
(B) affect the surrounding radius of the 
22
viewshed of a trail described in paragraph (2), 
23
as determined as the result of a viewshed anal-
24
ysis performed and submitted to the Federal

(2) TRAIL.—A trail described in this paragraph 
4
is a national scenic trail established under section 5 
5
of the National Trails System Act (16 U.S.C. 1244). 
6
(b) DETERMINATION.—The Federal Energy Regu-
7
latory Commission may issue a certificate of public con-
8
venience and necessity under section 7 of the Natural Gas 
9
Act (15 U.S.C. 717f) for a pipeline described in subsection 
10
(a)(1) only if the Commission determines that— 
11
(1) the pipeline is the only prudent and feasible 
12
alternative to meet an overriding public need; 
13
(2) the applicant, in order to result in no, or 
14
minimal, adverse effect to a trail described in sub-
15
section (a)(2) and the viewshed of such a trail, thor-
16
oughly considered, in this order, avoidance measures, 
17
minimization measures, mitigation measures, and 
18
enhancement measures, including alternative routes, 
19
expanding existing pipeline infrastructure, and poli-
20
cies to reduce energy demand in the region of need; 
21
(3) minimal road construction will be required 
22
to construct and operate the pipeline;

(4) construction of the pipeline will use the best 
1
available technology in order to minimize, as much 
2
as possible, the potential for leakage; 
3
(5) if the pipeline will intersect a trail described 
4
in subsection (a)(2), the pipeline will intersect the 
5
trail— 
6
(A) at a point that is already subject to 
7
significant impact, including an existing energy 
8
or transportation infrastructure crossing, or the 
9
applicant made a documented effort to consider 
10
such a route; and 
11
(B) only once and using the shortest path 
12
possible in crossing the trail; 
13
(6) the pipeline will not affect the surrounding 
14
viewshed of a trail described in subsection (a)(2) in 
15
an area that— 
16
(A) has been identified, through the 
17
viewshed analysis of the trail described in 
18
(a)(1)(B), as an area of high conservation, rec-
19
reational, or scenic value; 
20
(B) is a protected wilderness area, as de-
21
fined by the Wilderness Act of 1964, an old- 
22
growth forest, or an alpine area; or 
23
(C) has an existing designated location for 
24
a shelter or campsite;

(7) construction techniques to be used for the 
1
pipeline will produce a minimal disturbance to any 
2
trail described in subsection (a)(2) and surrounding 
3
conserved lands; 
4
(8) the applicant has demonstrated plans for 
5
the ongoing maintenance and operation of the pipe-
6
line that ensures such maintenance and operation is 
7
done in a way that minimizes impact on any trail 
8
described in subsection (a)(2) that the pipeline will 
9
intersect, or the viewshed of which will be affected 
10
by the pipeline, and surrounding conserved lands; 
11
and 
12
(9) the applicant clearly acknowledges that it 
13
has an affirmative duty to— 
14
(A) protect any trail described in sub-
15
section (a)(2) that the pipeline will intersect, or 
16
the viewshed of which will be affected by the 
17
pipeline, and surrounding environment; and 
18
(B) ensure the health and safety of the 
19
public who use such trail and surrounding envi-
20
