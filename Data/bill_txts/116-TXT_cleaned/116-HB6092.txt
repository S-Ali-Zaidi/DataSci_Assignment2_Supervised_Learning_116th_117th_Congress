life-saving extending precision clinical trials and research, 
and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

Congress makes the following findings:

•HR 6092 IH
(1) Prostate cancer is the number one cancer 
1
diagnosed in the Veterans Health Administration. 
2
(2) A 1996 report published by the National 
3
Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine es-
4
tablished a link between prostate cancer and expo-
5
sure to herbicides, such as Agent Orange. 
6
(3) It is essential to acknowledge that due to 
7
these circumstances, certain veterans are made 
8
aware that they are high-risk individuals when it 
9
comes to the potential to develop prostate cancer. 
10
(4) In being designated as ‘‘high risk’’, it is es-
11
sential that veterans are proactive in seeking earlier 
12
preventative clinical services for the early detection 
13
and successful treatment of prostate cancer, whether 
14
that be through the Veterans Health Administration 
15
or through a community provider. 
16
(5) Clinical preventative services and initial de-
17
tection are some of the most important components 
18
in the early detection of prostate cancer for veterans 
19
at high risk of prostate cancer. 
20
(6) For veterans with prostate cancer, including 
21
prostate cancer that has metastasized, precision on-
22

23
