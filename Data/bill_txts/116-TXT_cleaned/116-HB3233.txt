A BILL 
To support the implementation of the National Defense 
Strategy for the United States, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘National Defense 
4
Strategy Implementation Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) According to the 2017 National Security 
8
Strategy (NSS), ‘‘China and Russia are developing 
9

advanced weapons and capabilities that could threat-
1
en our critical infrastructure and our command and 
2
control architecture’’ and ‘‘China and Russia chal-
3
lenge American power, influence, and interests, at-
4
tempting to erode American security and pros-
5
perity’’. The NSS sets the country’s primary focus 
6
as sustaining favorable regional balances of power in 
7
the key regions of the world, and the use of our alli-
8
ance and partnership architecture as the mechanism 
9
for doing so. 
10
(2) The 2018 National Defense Strategy (NDS) 
11
rightly stresses that long-term, strategic competition 
12
with China and Russia should be the top priority of 
13
the United States and the Department of Defense 
14
and require both increased and sustained invest-
15
ment, both because of the magnitude of the threats 
16
they pose to United States security and prosperity 
17
today and the potential for those threats to increase 
18
in the future. 
19
(3) To meet such challenges, the NDS states 
20
that the strategy of the United States will be to ex-
21
pand the competitive space while pursuing three dis-
22
tinct lines of effort, including rebuilding military 
23
readiness to build a more lethal Joint Force, 
24
strengthening alliances and attracting new partners,

and reforming the Department’s business practices 
1
for greater performance and affordability. 
2
(4) In the January 2019 Worldwide Threat As-
3
sessment, the United States Intelligence Community 
4
stated that ‘‘Russia and China seek to shape the 
5
international system and regional security dynamics 
6
and exert influence over the politics and economics 
7
of states in all regions of the world and especially in 
8
their backyards’’. 
9
(5) ‘‘China and Russia will present a wide vari-
10
ety of economic, political, counterintelligence, mili-
11
tary, and diplomatic challenges to the United States 
12
and its allies. We anticipate that they will collabo-
13
rate to counter U.S. objectives, taking advantage of 
14
rising doubts in some places about the liberal demo-
15
cratic model.’’. 
16
(6) The December 2018 U.S. Government Ac-
17
countability Office (GAO) report to congressional 
18
committees on Long-Range Emerging Threats Fac-
19
ing the United States as Identified by Federal Agen-
20
cies stated that, ‘‘China is marshalling its diplo-
21
matic, economic, and military resources to facilitate 
22
its rise as a regional and global power. This may 
23
challenge U.S. access to air, space, cyberspace, and 
24
maritime domains. China’s use of cyberspace and 
25

electronic warfare could impact various U.S. systems 
1
and operations. Russia is increasing its capability to 
2
challenge the United States across multiple warfare 
3
domains, including attempting to launch computer- 
4
based directed energy attacks against U.S. military 
5
assets. Russia is also increasing its military and po-
6
litical presence in key locations across the world.’’. 
7
(7) According to the 2018 Assessment and Rec-
8
ommendations by the National Defense Strategy 
9
Commission (NDSC), ‘‘the U.S. military could suf-
10
fer unacceptably high casualties and loss of major 
11
capital assets in its next conflict. It might struggle 
12
to win, or perhaps lose, a war against China or Rus-
13
sia. The United States is particularly at risk of 
14
being overwhelmed should its military be forced to 
15
fight on two or more fronts simultaneously. Addi-
16
tionally, it would be unwise for and irresponsible not 
17
to expect adversaries to attempt debilitating kinetic, 
18
cyber, or other types of attacks against Americans 
19
at home while they seek to defeat our military 
20
abroad. U.S. military superiority is no longer as-
21
sured and the implications for American interests 
22
and American security are severe.’’. 
23
(8) As such, the NDSC states that ‘‘DOD and 
24

security must focus current and future investments 
1
on operational challenges such as protecting critical 
2
bases of operations; rapidly reinforcing and sus-
3
taining forces engaged forward; assuring information 
4
systems and conducting effective information oper-
5
ations; defeating anti-access/area-denial threats; de-
6
terring, and if necessary defeating, the use of nu-
7
clear or other strategic weapons in ways that fall 
8
short of justifying a large-scale nuclear response; en-
9
hancing the capabilities and survivability of space 
10
systems and supporting infrastructure; and devel-
11
oping an interoperable joint command, control, com-
12
munications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, 
13
and reconnaissance (C4ISR) architecture that sup-
14
ports the warfare of the future.’’. 
15
(9) Additionally, the NDSC states that ‘‘Mak-
16
ing informed decisions about strategic, operational, 
17
and force development issues requires a foundation 
18
of state-of-the-art analytic capabilities. . . . Specifi-
19
cally, the Department needs a rigorous force devel-
20
opment plan that connects its investment strategy 
21
with its key priorities of winning in conflict and 
22
competing effectively with China and Russia.’’.

1
‘‘The Department of Defense’s (DOD) analytic ap-
2
proach has not provided senior leaders with the sup-
3
port they need to evaluate and determine the force 
4
structure necessary to implement the National De-
5
fense Strategy.’’. 
6
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
7
It is the sense of Congress as follows: 
8
(1) The United States must be prepared to 
9
meet the challenges of competitive nations that are 
10
seeking to diminish the United States military ad-
11
vantage and threaten vital United States interests, 
12
and China is the most significant such challenge. 
13
(2) The National Defense Strategy provides the 
14
correct framework to prepare for major-power com-
15
petition and conflict, but adequate resources are re-
16
quired and implementation across the entire Depart-
17
ment of Defense enterprise in line with the focus of 
18
that strategy on readying the Joint Force for com-
19
petition and conflict against China and Russia. 
20
(3) The United States is committed to uphold-
21
ing a free and open international order that pro-
22
motes republican government and governance in con-
23
cert with collective security, international laws, and

human dignity while respecting the sovereignty of 
1
other countries. 
2
(4) The Department of Defense should urgently 
3
and at scale adapt the Joint Force’s shape, posture, 
4
development vectors, and employment models to 
5
maintain military advantage alongside our allies and 
6
partners against China and Russia. To do this, the 
7
Department of Defense should develop adapted, new 
8
warfighting concepts at the operational level of war 
9
that allow the United States to achieve its political 
10
objectives in politically tenable ways. In concert, the 
11
Joint Force should become more lethal, resilient, 
12
agile, and ready to deal with Chinese and Russian 
13
strategies and theories of victory. 
14
(5) Investments should be focused on expanding 
15
United States operational options while constraining 
16
those to strategic competitors, such as China and 
17
Russia.
