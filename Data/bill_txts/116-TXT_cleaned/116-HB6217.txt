The Congress finds the following:

•HR 6217 IH
(1) In 2018, according to the Department of 
1
Agriculture, 37,200,000 individuals in the United 
2
States (including 11,100,000 children) lived in food 
3
insecure households. That equals 1 in 9 individuals 
4
and 1 in 7 children. 
5
(2) In 2017, according to the Bureau of the 
6
Census, 
38,100,000 
individuals 
(including 
7
13,200,000 children) lived below the Federal poverty 
8
line. The majority of these individuals living in pov-
9
erty were working people, children, older individuals, 
10
and individuals with disabilities. 
11
(3) Many low-income individuals work multiple 
12
jobs and, contrary to common misconceptions, if un-
13
employed, they spend a great deal of time looking 
14
for work. They often travel by public transportation, 
15
laboriously making multiple connections to shuttle 
16
between home, work, social service agencies, houses 
17
of worship, and grocery stores. For those living in 
18
rural and suburban areas far from work and without 
19
adequate public transportation they rely upon vehi-
20
cles to get to work, but these are often less reliable 
21
secondhand vehicles, that often break down. From 
22
traveling greater distances between available jobs 
23
and livable areas with affordable housing options, 
24
seeking out scarce childcare options that fit a tight

budget and a constrained travel schedule, and caring 
1
for elderly parents or grandparents because a senior 
2
living facility is not financially realistic, low-income 
3
individuals have little spare time. 
4
(4) While government safety net programs help 
5
tens of million of individuals avoid starvation, home-
6
lessness, and other outcomes even more dreadful 
7
than everyday poverty, there are significant obstacles 
8
that those seeking and maintaining government as-
9
sistance face for as long as they are eligible. Quali-
10
fied applicants are often required to travel signifi-
11
cant distances to multiple government offices, pre-
12
paring and submitting piles of nearly identical pa-
13
perwork to access the different government assist-
14
ance programs. Even when the application process 
15
begins online, the eligible applicant is typically still 
16
required to physically follow up with each govern-
17
ment office with physical copies, for near identical 
18
meetings. As a result, many low-income people are 
19
actually unaware of all the government benefits for 
20
which they are eligible, reducing the amount of help 
21
going to individuals in need by tens of billions of 
22
dollars every year. The lines in these offices can 
23
seem endless, and sometimes clients need to wait 
24
outside, for hours, in the worst kinds of weather. 
25

•HR 6217 IH
Many offices don’t have weekend or night hours, so 
1
an applicant is at risk of losing wages when often 
2
their only option is to apply for government help 
3
during work hours. 
4
(5) Each year, many vital government programs 
5
go underutilized because eligible beneficiaries are 
6
hindered by obtrusive, time consuming, and repet-
7
itive application barriers. In 2015, according to the 
8
Department of Agriculture, 15 percent of all people 
9
eligible for supplemental nutrition assistance pro-
10
gram (SNAP), 25 percent of the ‘‘working poor’’ eli-
11
gible for SNAP, and 55 percent of seniors over 60 
12
who were eligible failed to receive it. 
13
(6) The United States has hundreds of thou-
14
sands of nonprofit groups providing high quality and 
15
much needed social services, but it is nearly impos-
16
sible for struggling people to determine which of 
17
those organizations provides services they need, 
18
whether the organization is conveniently located, and 
19
for which services they are eligible. If they do deter-
20
mine that a nonprofit (or multiple nonprofits) could 
21
help, they need to take yet more time to visit each 
22
one. 
23
(7) Since many government and nonprofit pro-
24
grams require frequent reapplications and recertifi-
25

•HR 6217 IH
cations, a low-income person often has to repeat the 
1
same endless and frustrating process. 
2
(8) Technology has fundamentally revamped the 
3
lives of most individuals, usually for the better. Ac-
4
cording to the Pew Research Center, 64 percent of 
5
low-income individuals have a smart phone as of 
6
2016 (not because a smart phone is a luxury but be-
7
cause it is an essential tool of learning and work in 
8
modern America) but they rarely can use these de-
9
vices to apply for benefits. Digital technology, com-
10
bined with policy improvements, can simplify the 
11
lives and boost the long-term self-sufficiency of our 
12
lowest income residents.
