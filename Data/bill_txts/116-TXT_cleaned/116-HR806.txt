RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
Congress should enact the Voters with Disabilities Bill 
of Rights to fulfill the promises of the Americans With 
Disabilities Act of 1990 and other civil rights laws which 
demand equal access to the ballot box for people with 
disabilities and to reaffirm and ensure that voters with 
disabilities have equal access to the ballot box. 
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention re-
ported that 61,000,000 Americans live with a disability;

Whereas the School of Management and Labor Relations at 
Rutgers University projected that in 2016 there were 
35,400,000 people with disabilities eligible to vote in the 
United States, one-sixth of the total American electorate; 
Whereas, despite the size, diversity, and the interest of people 
with disabilities to participate in the United States elec-
toral system, America’s elections are woefully, inexcus-
ably, and unjustly not fully accessible to all voters; 
Whereas the Government Accountability Office found that 65 
percent of voting stations had an accessible voting system 
that could impede the casting of a private and inde-
pendent vote in 2016; 
Whereas despite the demonstrated investment of the dis-
ability community in elections, people with disabilities 
continue to turn out to vote at a lower rate than their 
nondisabled peers; and 
Whereas the School of Management and Labor Relations at 
Rutgers University found that voter turnout of people 
with disabilities lagged behind the nondisabled population 
by a difference of 6 percentage points in 2016 and 5.7 
percentage points in 2012: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-
