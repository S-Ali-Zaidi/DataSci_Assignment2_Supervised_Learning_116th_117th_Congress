dina, Saudi Arabia, the first day of which began the Is-

Whereas Islam is the fastest growing religion of the world; 
Whereas it is estimated that there are approximately

Whereas the fundamental Muslim practices are known as the 
Five Pillars of Islam;

salat (prayer 5 times daily), zakat (give 2.5 percent of all 
earnings to charity), sawm (fasting in the month of 
Ramadan), and Hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Ara-
bia);

lievers praying in congregations and helps one refrain 
from committing sins; 
Whereas the obligatory charity purifies a person from selfish-
ness and encourages empathy to the poor; 
Whereas fasting in Ramadan promotes self-restraint and 
spiritual renewal for Muslims worldwide;

1,000 pilgrims were allowed while adhering to ‘‘safety 
bubbles’’ and social distancing measures over fears of the 
coronavirus; 
Whereas Muslims consider Islam to be a way of life; and 
Whereas carrying out these obligations provides the frame-
work of a Muslim’s life, and weaves their everyday activi-
ties and their beliefs into a single cloth of religious devo-
tion: Now, therefore, be it
