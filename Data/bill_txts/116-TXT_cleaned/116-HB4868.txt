A BILL 
To certify that United States assistance to the United Na-
tions for humanitarian programs in the Syrian Arab 
Republic is not misdirected, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Stop UN Support for 
4
Assad Act of 2019’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) The United States, which has been the big-
8
gest donor to the United Nations (UN) Humani-
9

tarian Response in Syria, has provided more than 
1
$6,000,000,000 for UN Syria programming since 
2
2011, including over $435,000,000 in fiscal year 
3
2018 alone. 
4
(2) During the past eight years of conflict, the 
5
Assad regime has repeatedly weaponized access to 
6
United Nations aid in prolonged and unlawful sieges 
7
of civilians as part of a widespread ‘‘starve or sur-
8
render’’ campaign, with the United Nations esti-
9
mating 975,000 Syrians under siege at the peak of 
10
this strategy. 
11
(3) The United Nations Office for the Coordi-
12
nation of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has re-
13
ported repeated failures to deliver aid to the hardest- 
14
hit areas due to such obstructions by the Assad re-
15
gime. 
16
(4) On February 12, 2018, former U.S. Ambas-
17
sador to Syria Robert Ford wrote of UN aid in 
18
Syria that ‘‘it is clear the aid is not neutral and is 
19
being used as a weapon by the Syrian government.’’. 
20
(5) The United Nations continues to procure 
21
goods and services from several entities that have 
22
close ties to the Assad regime, despite their role in 
23
supporting the Assad regime’s gross human rights 
24
violations and international crimes—including tor-

•HR 4868 IH
ture, sexual violence, the targeting of medical facili-
1
ties, weaponized mass starvation, enforced dis-
2
appearance, and forced displacement—for which the 
3
United Nations itself has found the Assad regime 
4
culpable. 
5
(6) A 2016 study of the UN Report of Procure-
6
ment showed that UN operations in Syria delivered 
7
$4 million to Syria’s state-owned fuel industry, $5 
8
million to blood banks operated by the Syrian Arab 
9
Army for the benefit of its troops, and $8.5 million 
10
to charities co-opted by members of the Assad fam-
11
ily. 
12
(7) International NGOs working with the 
13
United Nations are forced to select local partners, 
14
many of which are controlled by the Assad family 
15
and inner circle, from a government-approved list, 
16
therefore allowing these actors to profit from hu-
17
manitarian relief efforts and perpetuate the conflict, 
18
international crimes, and human rights violations. 
19
(8) The Assad regime compels the United Na-
20
tions to house its 150 international staff in the Four 
21
Seasons Hotel Damascus where, since 2016, the 
22
United Nations has spent more than $26,000 a 
23
night, equalling nearly $10 million a year.

(9) On June 11, 2019, the United States 
1
Treasury Department sanctioned the Four Seasons 
2
Hotel in Damascus for its role in fueling an illicit 
3
network benefitting the Assad regime, and also sanc-
4
tioned its owner Samer Foz a businessman who is 
5
‘‘directly supporting the murderous Assad regime 
6
and building luxury developments on land stolen 
7
from those fleeing his brutality’’, according to U.S. 
8
Treasury Undersecretary Sigal Mandelker; the Euro-
9
pean Union likewise sanctioned Foz for funding the 
10
Military Security Shield Forces, a pro-government 
11
militia responsible for severe human rights abuses. 
12
(10) United Nation agencies and international 
13
NGOs are required to purchase mobile phones from 
14
Syriatel, a company owned by Rami Makhlouf, a 
15
cousin of Bashar al-Assad who is sanctioned for cor-
16
ruption and whose involvement in human rights 
17
abuses in Syria is well documented. 
18
(11) The Assad regime has regularly siphoned 
19
humanitarian funds for the war effort and bypassed 
20
international sanctions through exploiting humani-
21
tarian exemptions. 
22
(12) On July 15, 2019, United Nations High 
23
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Middle East 
24
Director Amin Awad recognized in an interview with 
25

•HR 4868 IH
The National that the United Nations has no proce-
1
dure for assessing ownership and partnerships of 
2
suppliers it uses for procurement in Syria: ‘‘I do not 
3
have a mechanism where we comb every single con-
4
tract to see do you have one, 10 or 90 percent con-
5
nection with the regime or not.’’. 
6
(13) On June 28, 2019, Human Rights Watch 
7
published a comprehensive report with the following 
8
conclusion: ‘‘While seemingly benign, the Syrian gov-
9
ernment’s aid and reconstruction policies are being 
10
used to punish perceived opponents and reward its 
11
supporters. . . . The Syrian government’s aid 
12
framework undermines human rights, and donors 
13
need to ensure they are not complicit . . . .’’. 
14
SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
15
It is the policy of the United States that— 
16
(1) the delivery of assistance funded by the 
17
United States through the United Nations must 
18
meet reasonable expectations that aid reaches its in-
19
tended recipients; 
20
(2) programming provided through the United 
21
Nations based on United States funding should be 
22
determined according to greatest need, not only 
23
greatest access; 
24

H4868
6 
•HR 4868 IH
(3) United States assistance to Syria should not 
1
be manipulated for political or financial gain of any 
2
party to the conflict, especially those most respon-
3
sible for compounding the suffering of Syrian civil-
4
ians, including the Assad regime, the Russian Fed-
5
eration, the Islamic Republic of Iran, any entities 
6
owned or controlled thereof, or non-state actors in-
7
volved in international crimes and human rights 
8
abuses; 
9
(4) no United States assistance should be given 
10
directly or indirectly to the Assad regime in Syria, 
11
including through organs or subsidiaries of the 
12
United Nations; 
13
(5) the United States should support all efforts 
14
by the United Nations to establish an independent 
15
mechanism to vet procurement contracts in Syrian 
16
government-held areas, and such a mechanism 
17
must— 
18
(A) ensure no contracts are entered into 
19
with the Assad regime or its affiliates; 
20
(B) develop and implement enhanced 
21
human rights due diligence practices, including 
22
conducting quarterly human rights impact as-
23
sessments that review how United Nations aid 
24
03:54 Nov 01, 2019

•HR 4868 IH
is disbursed and how such aid flows through its 
1
suppliers and local partners in Syria; and 
2
(C) make certain that the findings of the 
3
human rights impact assessments are inte-
4
grated into all levels of United Nations oper-
5
ations, monitor the effectiveness of such assess-
6
ments on such operations, and report how 
7
human rights impacts are being addressed and 
8
mitigated; 
9
(6) the United Nations procurement operations 
10
throughout Syria should abide by its own United 
11
Nations Supplier Code of Conduct, which states that 
12
suppliers to the United Nations must ‘‘ensure that 
13
they are not complicit in human rights abuses’’; and 
14
(7) the United States will continue providing 
15
humanitarian assistance to Syria while also con-
16
tinuing its efforts to facilitate a negotiated political 
17
transition from the Assad regime, in accordance 
18
with its commitment in United Nations Security 
19
Council Resolution 2254.
