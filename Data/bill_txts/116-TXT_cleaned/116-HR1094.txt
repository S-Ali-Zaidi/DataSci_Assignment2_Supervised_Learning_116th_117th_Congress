RESOLUTION 
Condemning QAnon and rejecting the conspiracy theories 
it promotes. 
Whereas throughout history, conspiracy theories that falsely 
blame secret cabals or marginalized groups for society’s 
ills have fueled prejudice, genocide, and acts of terrorism; 
Whereas QAnon is a movement promoting a collection of un-
founded conspiracy theories that have spread widely on 
the internet since 2017; 
Whereas QAnon initially alleged that prominent Americans 
are engaged in a secret plot to control the world, while 
using their power to exploit children, and has expanded 
to embrace virtually every popular conspiracy theory of 
the last several decades, from questioning the Kennedy 
assassination, to believing in alien landings, to denying 
the safety of vaccines;

Whereas many QAnon followers express anti-Semitic views, 
and the Anti-Defamation League has said that the move-
ment’s central conspiracy theory includes anti-Semitic 
elements; 
Whereas the FBI has assessed with high confidence that 
‘‘fringe political conspiracy theories’’, including QAnon, 
‘‘very likely motivate some domestic extremists, wholly or 
in part, to engage in criminal or violent activity’’, and 
that these conspiracy theories ‘‘very likely encourage the 
targeting of specific people, places and organizations, 
thereby increasing the likelihood of violence against these 
targets’’; 
Whereas the FBI bases this assessment on ‘‘events in which 
individuals committed crimes, plotted attacks, or success-
fully carried out deadly violence, and who—either before 
or after their arrests—attributed their actions to their 
conspiratorial beliefs’’; 
Whereas QAnon adherents have been implicated in crimes 
that they claim their QAnon beliefs inspired, including— 
(1) a man arrested in 2018 for plotting to plant a 
bomb in the Illinois Capitol rotunda to make Americans 
aware of the ‘‘Pizzagate’’ conspiracy theory; 
(2) a man arrested in 2018 for using an armored 
car to block traffic on the Hoover Dam Bypass Bridge; 
(3) a man in Arizona arrested in 2019 for vandal-
izing a Catholic church; 
(4) a woman in Colorado arrested in 2019 for plot-
ting an armed raid to kidnap her child, who had been 
taken from her custody; 
(5) a man charged with the murder of an organized 
crime boss in New York in 2019; and

(6) a woman arrested in New York with a car full 
of knives after posting a video accusing Joe Biden of par-
ticipating in child sex trafficking and threatening to kill 
him; 
Whereas the FBI further assesses that ‘‘these conspiracy 
theories very likely will emerge, spread and evolve in the 
modern information marketplace . . . fostering anti-gov-
ernment sentiment, racial and religious prejudice, [and] 
increasing political tensions’’; 
Whereas according to the Combatting Terrorism Center at 
the West Point Military Academy, ‘‘QAnon is arguably 
no longer simply a fringe conspiracy theory but an ide-
ology that has demonstrated its capacity to radicalize to 
violence individuals at an alarming speed’’; 
Whereas Facebook, Twitter, and Google have removed or 
blocked QAnon groups and content from their platform 
for violating their policies against misinformation, bul-
lying, hate speech, and harassment; 
Whereas QAnon adherents have been harming legitimate ef-
forts to combat child exploitation and sex trafficking, in-
cluding by overwhelming anti-trafficking hotlines with 
false reports; and 
Whereas the conspiracy theories promoted by QAnon under-
mine trust in America’s democratic institutions, encour-
age rejection of objective reality, and deepen our Nation’s 
political polarization: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) condemns QAnon and rejects the conspiracy 
2
theories it promotes;
