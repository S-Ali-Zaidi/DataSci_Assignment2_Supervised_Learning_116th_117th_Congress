JOINT RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for designation of July 20th as ‘‘National 
Space Exploration Day’’ to commemorate the anniver-
sary of the Apollo 11 moon landing. 
Whereas President John Fitzgerald Kennedy, before a joint 
session of Congress on May 25, 1961, declared that ‘‘this 
Nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before 
this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and 
returning him safely to the Earth’’; 
Whereas, on July 20, 1969, the world’s attention was riveted 
on the historic achievement of the first landing, footsteps, 
and exploration of our Moon; 
Whereas the 9-day mission of Apollo 11 kept the world spell-
bound from its July 16th launch through its July 24th

splashdown, securing its place among the epic voyages of 
human history with those of Magellan, Drake, Columbus, 
and others; 
Whereas United States national space policy provides for a 
United States-led, integrated program with commercial 
and international partners for a human return to the 
Moon, followed by missions to Mars and beyond; 
Whereas the purpose of the United States space program is, 
and has always been, the peaceful exploration of space 
for the benefit of all humanity; 
Whereas the United States space program has provided im-
mense scientific and technological benefits affecting a 
multitude of aspects of 21st century life for all humanity; 
Whereas the United States space program, through other-
worldly programs such as Apollo, Viking, Voyager, 
Cassini-Huygens, Spirit, Opportunity, New Horizons and 
other missions to the planets, the Space Shuttle, the 
Hubble Space Telescope, the International Space Station, 
and other great space efforts, have provided our Nation 
with unparalleled scientific and technological leadership 
in the space, aeronautics, medical, and engineering 
sciences; 
Whereas the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 
the United States aerospace industry, and educational in-
stitutions throughout the Nation contribute enormously 
to our Nation’s intellectual capacity through research and 
development in support of the space program, and add 
great strength to the United States economy; 
Whereas the United States space program and the aerospace 
industry engage the best and the brightest minds that 
mirror the scientific and technical skill and quality of the

highest order and the finest in our national character— 
sacrifice, ingenuity, inventiveness, commitment, and our 
unrelenting spirit of adventure; 
Whereas over 400,000 patriots, from government, industry 
and academia, made exemplary efforts to put our astro-
nauts on the Moon, and those efforts created millions of 
private sector jobs as a result of the technological chal-
lenges they overcame to bring Project Apollo to fruition; 
Whereas the same spirit of adventure and engineering excel-
lence that landed our Apollo space pioneers on the Moon 
may be applied to all noble pursuits involving peace, 
brotherhood, courage, unity of the human spirit, and the 
exploration of new frontiers; 
Whereas, as a Nation, it is important to mobilize and invig-
orate appreciation and enthusiasm for space, to advance 
science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) edu-
cation through the excitement of space exploration, and 
to inspire today’s and future generations to build upon 
the accomplishments of our early space pioneers so they 
may reach new milestones of human achievement; and 
Whereas humankind will continue to explore, expand, and 
settle the new frontier of space with United States lead-
ership, courage, and values for the benefit of future 
spacefaring generations and for life on Earth: Now, 
therefore, be it
