SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress makes the following findings: 
2
(1) In August 1943 President Franklin D. Roo-
3
sevelt and other allied leaders proposed the creation 
4
of an American ground unit that would engage in a 
5
‘‘long-range penetration mission’’ in Japanese-occu-
6
pied Burma. This unit’s mission would be to cut off 
7
Japanese communications and supply lines, and cap-
8
ture Japanese-held airfield and town of Myitkyina. 
9
(2) President Roosevelt issued a call for volun-
10
teers for ‘‘a dangerous and hazardous mission’’, the 
11
call was answered by approximately 3,000 American 
12
soldiers. The unit was officially designated as the 
13
‘‘5307th Composite Unit (Provisional)’’ Code Name: 
14
‘‘Galahad’’. Later it became known as ‘‘Merrill’s 
15
Marauders’’ named after its leader, Brigadier Gen-
16
eral Frank Merrill. 
17
(3) In February 1944 the Marauders began 
18
their approximately 1,000-mile trek through the 
19
dense Burmese jungle. The Marauders had no artil-
20
lery support and carried their supplies on their 
21
backs or the pack saddles of mules. 
22
(4) Over the course of their 5-month trek to 
23
Myitkyina, 
the 
Marauders 
fought 
victoriously 
24
against larger Japanese forces through 5 major and 
25
30 minor engagements.

(5) During their march to Myitkyina the Ma-
1
rauders faced hunger and disease that were exacer-
2
bated by inadequate aerial resupply drops. Malaria, 
3
typhus, and dysentery inflicted more casualties on 
4
the Marauders than the Japanese. 
5
(6) By August 1944 the Marauders accom-
6
plished their mission, successfully disrupting Japa-
7
nese supply and communication lines, taking the 
8
town of Myitkyina and the Myitkyina airstrip, the 
9
only all-weather airstrip in Northern Burma. 
10
(7) After taking Myitkyina only 130 Marauders 
11
out of the original 2,750 were fit for duty. All re-
12
maining Marauders still in action were evacuated to 
13
hospitals due to tropical diseases, exhaustion, and 
14
malnutrition. 
15
(8) For their bravery and accomplishments the 
16
Marauders were awarded the ‘‘Distinguished Unit 
17
Citation’’, later redesignated as the ‘‘Presidential 
18
Unit Citation’’. Each Marauder also earned a 
19
Bronze Star for his service. 
20
(9) Though Merrill’s Marauders were oper-
21
ational for only a few months, the legacy of their 
22
bravery is honored by the United States Army 
23
through the modern day 75th Ranger Regiment,
