Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Student Loan Fairness 
4
Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) A well-educated citizenry is critical to our 
8
Nation’s ability to compete in the global economy. 
9
(2) The Federal Government has a vested inter-
10
est in ensuring access to higher education. 
11
(3) Higher education should be viewed as a 
12
public good benefitting our country rather than as a 
13
commodity solely benefitting individual students. 
14
(4) Total outstanding student loan debt offi-
15
cially surpassed total credit card debt in the United 
16
States 
in 
2015, 
and 
now 
exceeds 
17
$1,400,000,000,000. 
18
(5) Excessive student loan debt is impeding eco-
19
nomic growth in the United States. Faced with ex-
20
cessive repayment burdens, many individuals are un-
21
able to start businesses, invest, or buy homes. Re-
22
lieving student loan debt would give these individuals 
23
greater control over their earnings and would in-
24
02:23 Jun 18, 2019
H3257
3 
•HR 3257 IH
crease entrepreneurship and demand for goods and 
1
services. 
2
(6) Because of soaring tuition costs, students 
3
often have no choice but to amass significant debt 
4
to obtain an education that is widely considered a 
5
prerequisite for earning a living wage. 
6
(7) Amidst rising tuition rates and stagnant 
7
grant funding, many students are forced to supple-
8
ment Federal loans with private loans, which fre-
9
quently feature higher interest rates with fewer con-
10
sumer protections. 
11
(8) A borrower who experiences an extended 
12
hardship for whatever reason, or a borrower who ex-
13
periences a series of separate hardships over a 
14
longer period of time, will often have no choice but 
15
to default on his or her private student loans. Op-
16
portunities to put such private loans into forbear-
17
ance are limited. 
18
(9) During the period of forbearance on private 
19
student loans, interest continues to accrue and is 
20
capitalized, and once the borrower comes out of for-
21
bearance, he or she owes significantly more on the 
22
principal of the loan than before the hardship period 
23
began.
