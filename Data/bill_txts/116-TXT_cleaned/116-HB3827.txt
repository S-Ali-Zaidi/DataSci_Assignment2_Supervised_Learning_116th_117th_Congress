SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Hispanics are the largest, youngest, and 
3
second-fastest growing minority population in the 
4
United States. 
5
(2) While Hispanics compose 18 percent of the 
6
population of the United States, they compose 26 
7
percent of the prekindergarten through grade 12 
8
public school student enrollment in the United 
9
States. 
10
(3) Over 3,300 school districts have 25 percent 
11
or more Hispanic enrollment and those school dis-
12
tricts enroll 78 percent of all prekindergarten 
13
through grade 12 Hispanic students in the United 
14
States. 
15
(4) Hispanic students are overrepresented in 
16
lower educational outcomes, including lower grades, 
17
lower scores on standardized tests, and higher drop-
18
out rates. 
19
(5) Hispanic students tend to face greater bar-
20
riers once in college than non-Hispanic peers. Sev-
21
enty percent of Hispanic college students are first- 
22
generation college students and 48 percent of His-
23
panic college students have an expected family con-
24
tribution of $0, as calculated under title IV of the 
25
Higher Education Act of 1965.

(6) Hispanics are at high risk of not enrolling 
1
or graduating from institutions of higher education. 
2
(7) More Hispanics are going to college than 
3
ever before, but only a little more than half of the 
4
Hispanic students who enroll earn a bachelor’s de-
5
gree. 
6
(8) Hispanics lag behind non-Hispanic Whites, 
7
Blacks, and Asian American and Native American 
8
Pacific Islanders in attainment of high school diplo-
9
mas, associate’s degrees, and bachelor’s degrees. 
10
(9) Gains in Hispanic educational attainment 
11
will greatly benefit the United States economy be-
12
cause Hispanics will make up nearly 20 percent of 
13
the United States labor force by 2024. 
14
(10) Hispanics are an increasingly vital compo-
15
nent of the workforce of the United States. Between 
16
2010 and 2020, 74 percent of the growth in the 
17
workforce in the United States will be Hispanic 
18
workers. 
19
(11) Without eliminating the education gap for 
20
Hispanics now, the growing Hispanic population will 
21
not be prepared for the jobs of the future, hindering 
22
the economy of the United States.
