(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) The evidence for human-induced climate 
7
change is clear and undeniable. 
8
(2) According to the 2019 Worldwide Threat 
9
Assessment of the U.S. Intelligence Community, cli-
10
mate change will fuel competition for resources and 
11
cause economic distress and social discontent 
12
through 2019 and beyond. 
13
(3) In 2016, the National Intelligence Council 
14
found that ‘‘climate change and its resulting effects 
15
are likely to pose wide-ranging national security 
16
challenges for the United States and other countries 
17
over the next 20 years.’’.

(A) threaten the national security infra-

21
and abroad;

5
partnerships to improve understanding about the ef-
6
fects of climate change on national security, how-

ever, such efforts were undertaken in a sporadic 
8
manner because of inconsistent commitments to im-
9
proving understanding of those effects. 
10
(6) The United States needs to be fully pre-
11
pared to respond to the threats to, and harmful im-
12
pacts on, national security from climate change, but 
13
is not fully prepared at the present time.
