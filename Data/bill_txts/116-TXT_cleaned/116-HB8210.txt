(7) According to the Centers for Disease Con-
1
trol and Prevention— 
2
(A) between 2018 and 2019, drug overdose 
3
deaths involving methamphetamine and other 
4
stimulants increased by 27 percent nationally; 
5
(B) the number of deaths described in sub-
6
paragraph (A) increased in 27 of the 38 States 
7
that provide drug-specific overdose data to the 
8
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; 
9
and 
10
(C) between January 2019 and January 
11
2020, among 36 States and the District of Co-
12
lumbia, suspected stimulant overdoses, includ-
13
ing methamphetamine, treated in emergency de-
14
partments increased by 23 percent. 
15
(8) Methamphetamine-related overdose deaths 
16
will likely continue to increase in 2020, due in part 
17
to the ongoing COVID–19 pandemic, which makes 
18
obtaining treatment for substance use disorders, in-
19
cluding methamphetamine use, more difficult. 
20
(9) The increase in methamphetamine use and 
21
the negative respiratory and pulmonary health ef-
22
fects associated with its use has caused the National 
23
Institute on Drug Abuse to warn clinicians to be 
24
prepared to monitor adverse effects when treating

United States, the number of law enforcement and 
4
first responder agencies entering data into nation-
5
wide overdose mapping applications to track real- 
6
time suspected overdoses, including methamphet-
7
amine overdoses, has increased. 
8
(11) In the first 9 months of fiscal year 2020, 
9
there was a 52-percent increase in the amount of 
10
methamphetamine seized by U.S. Customs and Bor-

12
(12) Public reports indicated that Mexican car-
13
tels may be stockpiling money and illicit drugs, in-
14
cluding methamphetamine, on both sides of the 
15
Southwest Border and that the Drug Enforcement 
16
Administration is preparing to respond to any poten-
17
tial surge in supply. 
18
(13) Intentional preparation to counter any 
19
surges in production, distribution, and use are essen-
20
tial in lowering methamphetamine-related overdose 
21
deaths and substance use disorders.
