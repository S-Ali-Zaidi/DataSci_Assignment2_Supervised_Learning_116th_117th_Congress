a Foreign Terrorist Organization in 2013, and supports 
efforts to defeat Boko Haram with security and develop-
ment tools;

is engaged in an armed revolt against the Government of 
Nigeria, and has carried out vicious campaigns of vio-
lence against schools, public institutions, law enforce-
ment, and civilians;

mass kidnappings of women, girls, and boys, and has ab-
ducted thousands of women and girls from schools and 
markets, during raids on villages and houses, and on

Whereas, on April 14, 2014, Boko Haram militants attacked 
a boarding school in Chibok in Borno State, where girls

ing off the kidnappers’ trucks as they were driving away;

Whereas the international community, including the United 
Nations Secretary-General and the United Nations Secu-
rity Council, condemned the abduction and called for the 
immediate release of the girls; 
Whereas Boko Haram ruthlessly killed some of the kidnapped 
girls for trying to escape, while other girls died during 
childbirth while in captivity; 
Whereas thousands of women, girls, and boys kidnapped by 
Boko Haram have endured similar horrific experiences; 
Whereas the parents of the kidnapped girls and concerned 
citizens banded together and embarked upon a global 
awareness campaign to urge the rescue of the girls, using

more than 3,300,000 people around the world expressed 
their outrage at the abductions and continue maintaining 
a vigil for the girls’ return to their families; 
Whereas the United States Government sent advisors to Ni-
geria and supplied surveillance and reconnaissance to 
help rescue the girls; 
Whereas 21 of the kidnapped girls were released in October 
2016, and an additional 82 girls were released in May 
2017; 
Whereas nearly 5 years since their abduction, more than 100 
girls remain in captivity and are subjected to deplorable 
abuses as recounted by the girls who have been released; 
Whereas many of the released girls are being kept in a gov-
ernment facility in Abuja away from their families; 
Whereas despite claims by the Government of Nigeria that 
Boko Haram had been defeated, the terrorist organiza-
tion continues to mount attacks against civilians, schools, 
and security forces;

2017, a significant increase from the 19 used for such 
purpose in 2016;

in the northern region of Nigeria, routinely forcing girls

the purpose of sexual slavery) or becoming suicide bomb-
ers; 
Whereas, on February 19, 2018, Boko Haram militants 
stormed the town of Dapchi and abducted 110 girls from

2 other children; 
Whereas 106 of the children from the Dapchi kidnapping 
have been released and 5 of the children are presumed 
to have died in captivity; 
Whereas Leah Sharibu remains a hostage because she refuses 
to convert to Islam; 
Whereas a surge in violence at the end of 2018 has resulted 
in the displacement of an additional 80,000 people, fur-
ther burdening already overwhelmed communities and 
humanitarian services; 
Whereas according to the International Committee of the Red 
Cross and the Nigerian Red Cross Society, an estimated 
17,000 individuals from Nigeria are missing, including 
7,100 children; 
Whereas for several years the United States Government has 
provided assistance for women and girls targeted by Boko 
Haram and individuals displaced by Boko Haram vio-
lence, and has assisted in combating Boko Haram;

Whereas in section 1(c) of Public Law 114–266 (130 Stat. 
1383), Congress stated that ‘‘lack of economic oppor-
tunity and access to education, justice, and other social 
services contributes to the ability of Boko Haram to 
radicalize and recruit individuals’’;

giving girls the knowledge and tools to make positive de-
cisions about their futures, live healthier lives, provide 
nurturing environments for their families, and play active 
roles in their communities and economies;
