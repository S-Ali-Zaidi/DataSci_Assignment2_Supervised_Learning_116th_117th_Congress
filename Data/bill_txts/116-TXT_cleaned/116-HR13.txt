ARTICLE I 
3
In his conduct while President of the United States, 
4
Donald John Trump, in violation of his constitutional oath 
5
faithfully to execute the office of President of the United 
6
States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect, 
7
and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in 
8
violation of his constitutional duty to take care that the 
9
laws be faithfully executed, has prevented, obstructed and 
10
impeded the administration of justice during a Federal in-
11
vestigation in that: 
12
Knowing that Federal law enforcement authorities 
13
were investigating possible criminal law violations of his 
14
former National Security Advisor, General Michael Flynn 
15
and knowing that Federal law enforcement authorities 
16
were conducting one or more investigations into Russian 
17
state interference in the 2016 campaign for President of 
18
the United States, and that such investigation(s) included 
19
the conduct of his campaign personnel and associates act-
20
ing on behalf of the campaign, to include the possible col-
21
lusion by those individuals with the Russian government, 
22
Donald John Trump sought to use his authority to hinder 
23
and cause the termination of such investigation(s) includ-
24
ing through threatening, and then terminating, James

Comey, who was until such termination the Director of 
1
the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
2
The pattern of behavior leading to the conclusion that 
3
he sought to cause the hindrance or termination of said 
4
investigation(s) include the following: 
5
(1) Requesting that the Director of the Federal 
6
Bureau of Investigation curtail the investigation of 
7
the activities of General Michael Flynn under cir-
8
cumstances wherein it appeared that Director 
9
Comey might be terminated if he failed to adhere to 
10
such request. 
11
(2) Making a determination to terminate the 
12
Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and 
13
only thereafter requesting that the Deputy Attorney 
14
General provide him with a memorandum detailing 
15
inadequacies in the Director’s performance of his 
16
duties. 
17
(3) Despite offering differing rationales for the 
18
termination of the Director of the Federal Bureau of 
19
Investigation, admitted subsequently that the main 
20
reason for the termination was that the Director 
21
would not close or alter the investigation of matters 
22
related to the involvement of Russia in the 2016 
23
campaign for President of the United States.

(4) Stated that, once he had terminated the Di-
1
rector of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the 
2
pressure of said investigation had been significantly 
3
reduced. 
4
In all of this, Donald John Trump has acted in a 
5
manner contrary to his trust as President and subversive 
6
of constitutional government, to the great prejudice of the 
7
cause of law and justice and to the manifest injury of the 
8
people of the United States. 
9
Wherefore, Donald John Trump, by such conduct, 
10
warrants impeachment and trial, and removal from office.
