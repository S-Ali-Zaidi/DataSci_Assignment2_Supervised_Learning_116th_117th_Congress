(6) cooperation among cooperatives; and 
(7) concern for community; 
Whereas cooperative entrepreneurs are often categorized into

in almost every economic sector in the United States, 
throughout all 50 States and territories, and every con-
gressional district in the United States; 
Whereas internationally the principles of cooperation and the 
cooperative business model help smallholder farmers or-
ganize themselves and gain access to local and global

and marketing; 
Whereas this provides farmers ownership over their economic 
decisions, a focus on learning, and a broader under-
standing of environmental and social concerns; 
Whereas cooperatives help farmers increase incomes and be-
come more resilient to shocks and stresses by working to-
gether to plan and prepare for the future; 
Whereas cooperative values stress self-help, diversity, and in-
clusion of vulnerable groups to ensure access to women 
and youth;

grantee organizations use funding to provide technical as-
sistance to cooperatively owned businesses;

gram, and grantee organizations use funding to advance

nizations that have cooperative programs and interests, 
and has organized four meetings thus far; 
Whereas a bipartisan Congressional Cooperative Business 
Caucus unites Members of Congress in a cause to create

where are co-ops, and why do people choose them; 
Whereas, the Census Bureau, as part of its 2017 Economic 
Census, included a question in its survey of all businesses 
asking if the business is organized as a cooperative which 
will yield both quantitative and qualitative data on the ef-
fects and importance of cooperatives across the American 
economy; 
Whereas the University of Wisconsin Center for Cooperatives 
completed a research study in 2009, entitled, ‘‘Research 
on the Economic Impacts of Cooperatives’’, wherein they 
built a comprehensive list of all United States coopera-
tives, gathered economic data from cooperatives, analyzed 
the direct and indirect economic impacts of cooperatives, 
and developed approaches for measuring the unique eco-
nomic and social impacts of cooperatives; 
Whereas, in 2017, the University of Wisconsin Center for Co-
operatives found that there were 64,017 cooperatives in 
the United States operating in the commercial sales, 
marketing and production, financial services, social and 
public services, and utilities sectors; 
Whereas in the utility services sector, utility cooperatives are 
tasked with the delivery of public services such as elec-
tricity, water, telecommunications, and broadband, main-
ly throughout the rural United States, where investor- 
owned utility companies typically do not operate due to 
low profitability;

Whereas in the agriculture sector, cooperatives account for a 
significant portion of the economic activity in the United

or processed products more than if they performed these 
duties individually; 
Whereas food cooperatives range in size from small, local 
buying clubs to multistore regional giants that go head-

bility; 
Whereas housing cooperatives have roots dating to the late

like New York City, Chicago, and the District of Colum-

dents at colleges throughout the United States;

have converted to a resident-owned model; 
Whereas in worker cooperatives, members both perform the 
work and govern the business;

over the business in which they work and own; 
Whereas many sole proprietor, partnership, or family busi-
nesses are converting to worker-owned cooperatives when 
faced with a potential closure or buyout;

build a more inclusive economy that is more equitable,
