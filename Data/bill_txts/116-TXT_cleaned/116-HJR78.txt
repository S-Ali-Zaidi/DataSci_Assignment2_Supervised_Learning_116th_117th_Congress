JOINT RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for freedom of conscience. 
Whereas the settlement of the 13 colonies was driven in part 
by those seeking refuge from government-sponsored reli-
gious persecution; 
Whereas the Framers of the Constitution of the United 
States recognized the centrality of freedom of conscience 
to the establishment of the United States, enshrining in 
the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United 
States that ‘‘Congress shall make no law respecting an 
establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise 
thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the 
press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, 
and to petition the Government for a redress of griev-
ances’’;

Whereas churches, synagogues, mosques, and other religious 
organizations have played a central and invaluable role in 
life in the United States; and 
Whereas Congress has recognized the importance of religious 
institutions by enacting a variety of legal protections for 
those institutions, including exemption from income 
taxes: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives
1
of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
That— 
3
(1) the protections of freedom of conscience en-
4
shrined in the First Amendment to the Constitution 
5
of the United States remain central to the experi-
6
ment of the United States in republican self-govern-
7
ment under the Constitution of the United States; 
8
(2) government should not be in the business of 
9
dictating what ‘‘correct’’ religious beliefs are; and 
10
(3) any effort by the government to condition 
11
the receipt of the protections of the Constitution of 
12
the United States and the laws of the United States, 
13
including an exemption from taxation, on the public 
14
policy positions of an organization is an affront to 
15
the spirit and letter of the First Amendment to the 
16
Constitution of the United States.
