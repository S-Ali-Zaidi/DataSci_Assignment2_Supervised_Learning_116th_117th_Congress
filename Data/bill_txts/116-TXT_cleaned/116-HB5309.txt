SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

‘‘CROWN Act of 2019’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS; PURPOSE. 
5
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) Throughout United States history, society 
7
has used (in conjunction with skin color) hair tex-
8
ture and hairstyle to classify individuals on the basis 
9
of race. 
10
(2) Like one’s skin color, one’s hair has served 
11
as a basis of race and national origin discrimination. 
12
(3) Racial and national origin discrimination 
13
can and do occur because of longstanding racial and 
14
national origin biases and stereotypes associated 
15
with hair texture and style. 
16
(4) For example, routinely, people of African 
17
descent are deprived of educational and employment 
18
opportunities because they are adorned with natural 
19
or protective hairstyles in which hair is tightly coiled 
20
or tightly curled, or worn in locs, cornrows, twists, 
21
braids, Bantu knots, or Afros. 
22
(5) Racial and national origin discrimination is 
23
reflected in school and workplace policies and prac-
24
tices that bar natural or protective hairstyles com-
25
monly worn by people of African descent. 
26

•HR 5309 IH
(6) For example, as recently as 2018, the 
1
United States Armed Forces had grooming policies 
2
that barred natural or protective hairstyles that 
3
servicewomen of African descent commonly wear and 
4
that described these hairstyles as ‘‘unkempt’’. 
5
(7) In 2018, the United States Armed Forces 
6
rescinded these policies and recognized that this de-
7
scription perpetuated derogatory racial stereotypes. 
8
(8) The United States Armed Forces also rec-
9
ognized that prohibitions against natural or protec-
10
tive hairstyles that African-American servicewomen 
11
are commonly adorned with are racially discrimina-
12
tory and bear no relationship to African-American 
13
servicewomen’s occupational qualifications and their 
14
ability to serve and protect the Nation. 
15
(9) As a type of racial or national origin dis-
16
crimination, discrimination on the basis of natural 
17
or protective hairstyles that people of African de-
18
scent are commonly adorned with violates existing 
19
Federal law, including provisions of the Civil Rights 
20
Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq.), section 1977 
21
of the Revised Statutes (42 U.S.C. 1981), and the 
22
Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq.). How-
23
ever, some Federal courts have misinterpreted Fed-
24
eral civil rights law by narrowly interpreting the 
25
23:42 Dec 10, 2019
H5309
4 
•HR 5309 IH
meaning of race or national origin, and thereby per-
1
mitting, for example, employers to discriminate 
2
against people of African descent who wear natural 
3
or protective hairstyles even though the employment 
4
policies involved are not related to workers’ ability to 
5
perform their jobs. 
6
(10) Applying this narrow interpretation of race 
7
or national origin has resulted in a lack of Federal 
8
civil rights protection for individuals who are dis-
9
criminated against on the basis of characteristics 
10
that are commonly associated with race and national 
11
origin. 
12
(11) In 2019, State legislatures and municipal 
13
bodies throughout the United States have introduced 
14
and passed legislation that rejects certain Federal 
15
courts’ restrictive interpretation of race and national 
16
origin, and expressly classifies race and national ori-
17
gin discrimination as inclusive of discrimination on 
18
the basis of natural or protective hairstyles com-
19
monly associated with race and national origin. 
20
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
21
gress that— 
22
(1) the Federal Government should acknowl-
23
edge that individuals who have hair texture or wear 
24
a hairstyle that is historically and contemporarily as-
25

•HR 5309 IH
sociated with African Americans or persons of Afri-
1
can descent systematically suffer harmful discrimi-
2
nation in schools, workplaces, and other contexts 
3
based upon longstanding race and national origin 
4
stereotypes and biases; 
5
(2) a clear and comprehensive law should ad-
6
dress the systematic deprivation of educational, em-
7
ployment, and other opportunities on the basis of 
8
hair texture and hairstyle that are commonly associ-
9
ated with race or national origin; 
10
(3) clear, consistent, and enforceable legal 
11
standards must be provided to redress the wide-
12
spread incidences of race and national origin dis-
13
crimination based upon hair texture and hairstyle in 
14
schools, workplaces, housing, federally funded insti-
15
tutions, and other contexts; 
16
(4) it is necessary to prevent educational, em-
17
ployment, and other decisions, practices, and policies 
18
generated by or reflecting negative biases and 
19
stereotypes related to race or national origin; 
20
(5) the Federal Government must play a key 
21
role in enforcing Federal civil rights laws in a way 
22
that secures equal educational, employment, and 
23
other opportunities for all individuals regardless of 
24
their race or national origin; 
25

•HR 5309 IH
(6) the Federal Government must play a central 
1
role in enforcing the standards established under 
2
this Act on behalf of individuals who suffer race or 
3
national origin discrimination based upon hair tex-
4
ture and hairstyle; 
5
(7) it is necessary to prohibit and provide rem-
6
edies for the harms suffered as a result of race or 
7
national origin discrimination on the basis of hair 
8
texture and hairstyle; and 
9
(8) it is necessary to mandate that school, 
10
workplace, and other applicable standards be applied 
11
in a nondiscriminatory manner and to explicitly pro-
12
hibit the adoption or implementation of grooming re-
13
quirements that disproportionately impact people of 
14
African descent. 
15
(c) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act is to institute 
16
definitions of race and national origin for Federal civil 
17
rights laws that effectuate the comprehensive scope of pro-
18
tection Congress intended to be afforded by such laws and 
19
Congress’ objective to eliminate race and national origin 
20
discrimination in the United States.
