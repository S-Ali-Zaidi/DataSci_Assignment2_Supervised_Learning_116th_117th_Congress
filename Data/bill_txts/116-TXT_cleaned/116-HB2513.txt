A BILL 
To ensure that persons who form corporations or limited 
liability companies in the United States disclose the bene-
ficial owners of those corporations or limited liability 
companies, in order to prevent wrongdoers from exploit-
ing United States corporations and limited liability com-
panies for criminal gain, to assist law enforcement in 
detecting, preventing, and punishing terrorism, money 
laundering, and other misconduct involving United States 
corporations and limited liability companies, and for 
other purposes.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Corporate Trans-
4
parency Act of 2019’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Nearly 2,000,000 corporations and limited 
8
liability companies are being formed under the laws 
9
of the States each year. 
10
(2) Very few States require information about 
11
the beneficial owners of the corporations and limited 
12
liability companies formed under their laws. 
13
(3) A person forming a corporation or limited 
14
liability company within the United States typically 
15
provides less information at the time of incorpora-
16
tion than is needed to obtain a bank account or driv-
17
er’s license and typically does not name a single ben-
18
eficial owner. 
19
(4) Criminals have exploited State formation 
20
procedures to conceal their identities when forming 
21
corporations or limited liability companies in the 
22
United States, and have then used the newly created 
23
entities to commit crimes affecting interstate and 
24
international commerce such as terrorism, prolifera-
25

tion financing, drug and human trafficking, money 
1
laundering, tax evasion, counterfeiting, piracy, secu-
2
rities fraud, financial fraud, and acts of foreign cor-
3
ruption. 
4
(5) Law enforcement efforts to investigate cor-
5
porations and limited liability companies suspected 
6
of committing crimes have been impeded by the lack 
7
of available beneficial ownership information, as doc-
8
umented in reports and testimony by officials from 
9
the Department of Justice, the Department of 
10
Homeland Security, the Department of the Treas-
11
ury, and the Government Accountability Office, and 
12
others. 
13
(6) In July 2006, the leading international anti- 
14
money laundering standard-setting body, the Finan-
15
cial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (in 
16
this section referred to as the ‘‘FATF’’), of which 
17
the United States is a member, issued a report that 
18
criticizes the United States for failing to comply 
19
with a FATF standard on the need to collect bene-
20
ficial ownership information and urged the United 
21
States to correct this deficiency by July 2008. In 
22
December 2016, FATF issued another evaluation of 
23
the United States, which found that little progress 
24
has been made over the last ten years to address 
25
22:23 May 06, 2019

•HR 2513 IH
this problem. It identified the ‘‘lack of timely access 
1
to adequate, accurate and current beneficial owner-
2
ship information’’ as a fundamental gap in United 
3
States efforts to combat money laundering and ter-
4
rorist finance. 
5
(7) In response to the 2006 FATF report, the 
6
United States has urged the States to obtain bene-
7
ficial ownership information for the corporations and 
8
limited liability companies formed under the laws of 
9
such States. 
10
(8) In contrast to practices in the United 
11
States, all 28 countries in the European Union are 
12
required to have corporate registries that include 
13
beneficial ownership information. 
14
(9) To reduce the vulnerability of the United 
15
States to wrongdoing by United States corporations 
16
and limited liability companies with hidden owners, 
17
to protect interstate and international commerce 
18
from criminals misusing United States corporations 
19
and limited liability companies, to strengthen law en-
20
forcement investigations of suspect corporations and 
21
limited liability companies, to set a clear, universal 
22
standard for State incorporation practices, and to 
23
bring the United States into compliance with inter-
24
national anti-money laundering standards, Federal
