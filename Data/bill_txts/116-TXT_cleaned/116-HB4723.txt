•HR 4723 IH
(1) Pacific and Atlantic salmon are important 
1
for food, culture, ecology, and the economy.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act: 
10
(1) SALMON CONSERVATION AREA.—The term 
11
‘‘salmon conservation area’’ means a watershed, a 
12
portion of a watershed, multiple watersheds, or other 
13
defined spatial units that— 
14
(A) is identified under section 4(b); 
15
(B) meets the biological criteria (as identi-
16
fied by the Administrator of the National Oce-
17
anic and Atmospheric Administration and the 
18
Director of the Fish and Wildlife Service in co-
19
ordination with the relevant Federal agency 
20
with jurisdiction over such salmon conservation 
21
area) for abundance, productivity, diversity (ge-
22
netic and life history), habitat quality, or other 
23
biological attributes important to sustaining 
24

•HR 4723 IH
viable populations of salmon throughout their 
1
range; or 
2
(C) a watershed that is regionally signifi-
3
cant for the conservation of salmon. 
4
(2) SALMON STRONGHOLD.—The term ‘‘salmon 
5
stronghold’’ means a salmon conservation area that 
6
has relatively high anadromous salmonid abundance, 
7
productivity, and diversity (life history and run tim-
8
ing), as well as habitat quality or other biological at-
9
tributes important to sustaining viable populations 
10
of wild salmon throughout their range. The term 
11
stronghold can be applied to a watershed, multiple 
12
watersheds, or other defined spatial units where pop-
13
ulations are strong and diverse, and habitats have a 
14
high intrinsic potential to support a particular spe-
15
cies or suite of species. 
16
(3) RELEVANT FEDERAL AGENCY.—The term 
17
‘‘relevant Federal agency’’ means— 
18
(A) the Forest Service;
