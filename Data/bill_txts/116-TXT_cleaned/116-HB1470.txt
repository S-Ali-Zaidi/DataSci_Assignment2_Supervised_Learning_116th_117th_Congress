SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Anti-Hunger Em-

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
The Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) In 2014 the number of Americans facing 
8
hunger or food insecurity was 48,100,000, and 
9
15,300,000 children lived in these households. 
10
5,400,000 seniors ages 60 and up were also experi-
11
encing food hardship. 
12
(2) In August 2015 approximately 45,500,000 
13
people participate in the supplemental nutrition as-
14
sistance program (SNAP). In fiscal year 2014 on a 
15
monthly average, 47,600,000 people participated in 
16
this program, about 15 percent of the United States 
17
population. SNAP, the Special Supplemental Nutri-
18
tion Assistance Program for Women, Infants, and 
19
Children (WIC), and the National School Lunch 
20
Program (NSLP) are the largest nutrition assist-
21
ance programs, and 61 percent of food-insecure 
22
households participated in 1 or more of the 3 pro-
23
grams.

•HR 1470 IH
(3) Administrative burdens involved in securing 
1
supplemental nutrition assistance benefits are par-
2
ticularly burdensome for working families. 
3
(4) Each year tens of millions people in the 
4
United States, including children and seniors, are 
5
forced to rely on soup kitchens, food pantries, and 
6
other charitable feeding programs. 
7
(5) The charitable food distribution system in 
8
the United States would benefit from increased co-
9
ordination and technical assistance. 
10
(6) Helping those who use feeding programs to 
11
move ‘‘beyond the soup kitchen’’, by promoting the 
12
values of community, opportunity, and responsibility, 
13
is a national priority.
