SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Mothers and Offspring 
2
Mortality and Morbidity Awareness Act’’ or the 
3
‘‘MOMMA’s Act’’. 
4
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
5
Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) Every year, across the United States, 
7
4,000,000 women give birth, about 700 women suf-
8
fer fatal complications during pregnancy, while giv-
9
ing birth or during the postpartum period, and 
10
70,000 women suffer near-fatal, partum-related 
11
complications. 
12
(2) The maternal mortality rate is often used as 
13
a proxy to measure the overall health of a popu-
14
lation. While the infant mortality rate in the United 
15
States has reached its lowest point, the risk of death 
16
for women in the United States during pregnancy, 
17
childbirth, or the postpartum period is higher than 
18
such risk in many other developed nations. The esti-
19
mated maternal mortality rate (per 100,000 live 
20
births) for the 48 contiguous States and Wash-
21
ington, DC increased from 18.8 percent in 2000 to 
22
23.8 percent in 2014 to 26.6 percent in 2018. This 
23
estimated rate is on par with such rate for under-
24
developed nations such as Iraq and Afghanistan. 
25

•HR 1897 IH
(3) International studies estimate the 2015 ma-
1
ternal mortality rate in the United States as 26.4 
2
per 100,000 live births, which is almost twice the 
3
2015 World Health Organization estimation of 14 
4
per 100,000 live births. 
5
(4) It is estimated that more than 60 percent 
6
of maternal deaths in the United States are prevent-
7
able. 
8
(5) According to the Centers for Disease Con-
9
trol and Prevention, the maternal mortality rate var-
10
ies drastically for women by race and ethnicity. 
11
There are 12.7 deaths per 100,000 live births for 
12
White women, 43.5 deaths per 100,000 live births 
13
for African-American women, and 14.4 deaths per 
14
100,000 live births for women of other ethnicities. 
15
While maternal mortality disparately impacts Afri-
16
can-American women, this urgent public health crisis 
17
traverses race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, edu-
18
cational background, and geography. 
19
(6) African-American women are 3 to 4 times 
20
more likely to die from causes related to pregnancy 
21
and childbirth compared to non-Hispanic White 
22
women. 
23
(7) The findings described in paragraphs (1) 
24
through (6) are of major concern to researchers, 
25

academics, members of the business community, and 
1
providers across the obstetrical continuum rep-
2
resented by organizations such as March of Dimes; 
3
the Preeclampsia Foundation; the American College 
4
of Obstetricians and Gynecologists; the Society for 
5
Maternal-Fetal Medicine; the Association of Wom-
6

11
of Certified Professional Midwives; PCOS Challenge: 
12
The National Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Associa-
13
tion; and the American College of Nurse Midwives. 
14
(8) Hemorrhage, cardiovascular and coronary 
15
conditions, cardiomyopathy, infection, embolism, 
16
mental health conditions, preeclampsia and eclamp-
17
sia, polycystic ovary syndrome, infection and sepsis, 
18
and anesthesia complications are the predominant 
19
medical causes of maternal-related deaths and com-
20
plications. Most of these conditions are largely pre-
21
ventable or manageable. 
22
(9) Oral health is an important part of 
23
perinatal health. Reducing bacteria in a woman’s 
24
mouth during pregnancy can significantly reduce her 
25
22:59 Apr 03, 2019
H1897
5 
•HR 1897 IH
risk of developing oral diseases and spreading decay- 
1
causing bacteria to her baby. Moreover, some evi-
2
dence suggests that women with periodontal disease 
3
during pregnancy could be at greater risk for poor 
4
birth outcomes, such as preeclampsia, pre-term 
5
birth, and low-birth weight. Furthermore, a woman’s 
6
oral health during pregnancy is a good predictor of 
7
her newborn’s oral health, and since mothers can 
8
unintentionally spread oral bacteria to their babies, 
9
putting their children at higher risk for tooth decay, 
10
prevention efforts should happen even before chil-
11
dren are born, as a matter of pre-pregnancy health 
12
and prenatal care during pregnancy. 
13
(10) The United States has not been able to 
14
submit a formal maternal mortality rate to inter-
15
national data repositories since 2007. Thus, no offi-
16
cial maternal mortality rate exists for the United 
17
States. There can be no maternal mortality rate 
18
without streamlining maternal mortality-related data 
19
from the State level and extrapolating such data to 
20
the Federal level. 
21
(11) In the United States, death reporting and 
22
analysis is a State function rather than a Federal 
23
process. States report all deaths—including mater-
24
nal deaths—on a semi-voluntary basis, without 
25
22:59 Apr 03, 2019
H1897
6 
•HR 1897 IH
standardization across States. While the Centers for 
1
Disease Control and Prevention has the capacity and 
2
system for collecting death-related data based on 
3
death certificates, these data are not sufficiently re-
4
ported by States in an organized and standard for-
5
mat across States such that the Centers for Disease 
6
Control and Prevention is able to identify causes of 
7
maternal death and best practices for the prevention 
8
of such death. 
9
(12) Vital statistics systems often underesti-
10
mate maternal mortality and are insufficient data 
11
sources from which to derive a full scope of medical 
12
and social determinant factors contributing to ma-
13
ternal deaths. While the addition of pregnancy 
14
checkboxes on death certificates since 2003 have 
15
likely improved States’ abilities to identify preg-
16
nancy-related deaths, they are not generally com-
17
pleted by obstetrical providers or persons trained to 
18
recognize pregnancy-related mortality. Thus, these 
19
vital forms may be missing information or may cap-
20
ture inconsistent data. Due to varying maternal 
21
mortality-related analyses, lack of reliability, and 
22
granularity in data, current maternal mortality 
23
informatics do not fully encapsulate the myriad med-
24
ical and socially determinant factors that contribute 
25
22:59 Apr 03, 2019
H1897
7 
•HR 1897 IH
to such high maternal mortality rates within the 
1
United States compared to other developed nations. 
2
Lack of standardization of data and data sharing 
3
across States and between Federal entities, health 
4
networks, and research institutions keep the Nation 
5
in the dark about ways to prevent maternal deaths. 
6
(13) Having reliable and valid State data ag-
7
gregated at the Federal level are critical to the Na-
8
tion’s ability to quell surges in maternal death and 
9
imperative for researchers to identify long-lasting 
10
interventions. 
11
(14) Leaders in maternal wellness highly rec-
12
ommend that maternal deaths be investigated at the 
13
State level first, and that standardized, streamlined, 
14
de-identified data regarding maternal deaths be sent 
15
annually to the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
16
vention. Such data standardization and collection 
17
would be similar in operation and effect to the Na-
18
tional Program of Cancer Registries of the Centers 
19
for Disease Control and Prevention and akin to the 
20
Confidential Enquiry in Maternal Deaths Pro-
21
gramme in the United Kingdom. Such a maternal 
22
mortalities and morbidities registry and surveillance 
23
system would help providers, academicians, law-
24
makers, and the public to address questions con-
25

•HR 1897 IH
cerning the types of, causes of, and best practices to 
1
thwart, pregnancy-related or pregnancy-associated 
2
mortality and morbidity. 
3
(15) The United Nations’ Millennium Develop-
4
ment Goal 5a aimed to reduce by 75 percent, be-
5
tween 1990 and 2015, the maternal mortality rate, 
6
yet this metric has not been achieved. In fact, the 
7
maternal mortality rate in the United States has 
8
been estimated to have more than doubled between 
9
2000 and 2014. Yet, because national data are not 
10
fully available, the United States does not have an 
11
official maternal mortality rate. 
12
(16) Many States have struggled to establish or 
13
maintain Maternal Mortality Review Committees 
14
(referred to in this section as ‘‘MMRC’’). On the 
15
State level, MMRCs have lagged because States have 
16
not had the resources to mount local reviews. State- 
17
level reviews are necessary as only the State depart-
18
ments of health have the authority to request med-
19
ical records, autopsy reports, and police reports crit-
20
ical to the function of the MMRC. 
21
(17) The United Kingdom regards maternal 
22
deaths as a health systems failure and a national 
23
committee of obstetrics experts review each maternal 
24
death or near-fatal childbirth complication. Such 
25
22:59 Apr 03, 2019
H1897
9 
•HR 1897 IH
committee also establishes the predominant course of 
1
maternal-related deaths from conditions such as 
2
preeclampsia. Consequently, the United Kingdom 
3
has been able to reduce its incidence of preeclampsia 
4
to less than one in 10,000 women—its lowest rate 
5
since 1952. 
6
(18) The United States has no comparable, co-
7
ordinated Federal process by which to review cases 
8
of maternal mortality, systems failures, or best prac-
9
tices. Many States have active MMRCs and leverage 
10
their work to impact maternal wellness. For exam-
11
ple, the State of California has worked extensively 
12
with their State health departments, health and hos-
13
pital systems, and research collaborative organiza-
14
tions, including the California Maternal Quality Care 
15
Collaborative and the Alliance for Innovation on Ma-
16
ternal Health, to establish MMRCs, wherein such 
17
State has determined the most prevalent causes of 
18
maternal mortality and recorded and shared data 
19
with providers and researchers, who have developed 
20
and implemented safety bundles and care protocols 
21
related to preeclampsia, maternal hemorrhage, and 
22
the like. In this way, the State of California has 
23
been able to leverage its maternal mortality review 
24
board system, generate data, and apply those data 
25
22:59 Apr 03, 2019
H1897
10 
•HR 1897 IH
to effect changes in maternal care-related protocol. 
1
To date, the State of California has reduced its ma-
2
ternal mortality rate, which is now comparable to 
3
the low rates of the United Kingdom. 
4
(19) Hospitals and health systems across the 
5
United States lack standardization of emergency ob-
6
stetrical protocols before, during, and after delivery. 
7
Consequently, many providers are delayed in recog-
8
nizing critical signs indicating maternal distress that 
9
quickly escalate into fatal or near-fatal incidences. 
10
Moreover, any attempt to address an obstetrical 
11
emergency that does not consider both clinical and 
12
public health approaches falls woefully under the 
13
mark of excellent care delivery. State-based maternal 
14
quality collaborative organizations, such as the Cali-
15
fornia Maternal Quality Care Collaborative or enti-
16
ties participating in the Alliance for Innovation on 
17
Maternal Health (AIM), have formed obstetrical pro-
18
tocols, tool kits, and other resources to improve sys-
19
tem care and response as they relate to maternal 
20
complications and warning signs for such conditions 
21
as 
maternal 
hemorrhage, 
hypertension, 
and 
22
preeclampsia. 
23
(20) The Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
24
vention reports that nearly half of all maternal 
25
22:59 Apr 03, 2019
H1897
11 
•HR 1897 IH
deaths occur in the immediate postpartum period— 
1
the 42 days following a pregnancy—whereas more 
2
than one-third of pregnancy-related or pregnancy-as-
3
sociated deaths occur while a person is still preg-
4
nant. Yet, for women eligible for the Medicaid pro-
5
gram on the basis of pregnancy, such Medicaid cov-
6
erage lapses at the end of the month on which the 
7
60th postpartum day lands. 
8
(21) The experience of serious traumatic 
9
events, such as being exposed to domestic violence, 
10
substance use disorder, or pervasive racism, can 
11
over-activate the body’s stress-response system. 
12
Known as toxic stress, the repetition of high-doses 
13
of cortisol to the brain, can harm healthy neuro-
14
logical development, which can have cascading phys-
15
ical and mental health consequences, as documented 
16
in the Adverse Childhood Experiences study of the 
17
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
18
(22) A growing body of evidence-based research 
19
has shown the correlation between the stress associ-
20
ated with one’s race—the stress of racism—and 
21
one’s birthing outcomes. The stress of sex and race 
22
discrimination and institutional racism has been 
23
demonstrated to contribute to a higher risk of ma-
24
ternal mortality, irrespective of one’s gestational

age, maternal age, socioeconomic status, or indi-
1
vidual-level health risk factors, including poverty, 
2
limited access to prenatal care, and poor physical 
3
and mental health (although these are not nominal 
4
factors). African-American women remain the most 
5
at risk for pregnancy-associated or pregnancy-re-
6
lated 
causes 
of 
death. 
When 
it 
comes 
to 
7
preeclampsia, for example, which is related to obe-
8
sity, African-American women of normal weight re-
9
main the most at risk of dying during the perinatal 
10
period compared to non-African-American obese 
11
women. 
12
(23) The rising maternal mortality rate in the 
13
United States is driven predominantly by the dis-
14
proportionately high rates of African-American ma-
15
ternal mortality. 
16
(24) African-American women are 3 to 4 times 
17
more likely to die from pregnancy or maternal-re-
18
lated distress than are White women, yielding one of 
19
the greatest and most disconcerting racial disparities 
20
in public health. 
21
(25) Compared to women from other racial and 
22
ethnic 
demographics, 
African-American 
women 
23
across the socioeconomic spectrum experience pro-
24
longed, unrelenting stress related to racial and gen-
25
22:59 Apr 03, 2019

13 
•HR 1897 IH
der discrimination, contributing to higher rates of 
1
maternal mortality, giving birth to low-weight ba-
2
bies, and experiencing pre-term birth. Racism is a 
3
risk-factor for these aforementioned experiences. 
4
This cumulative stress often extends across the life 
5
course and is situated in everyday spaces where Afri-
6
can-American women establish livelihood. Structural 
7
barriers, lack of access to care, and genetic pre-
8
dispositions to health vulnerabilities exacerbate Afri-
9
can-American women’s likelihood to experience poor 
10
or fatal birthing outcomes, but do not fully account 
11
for the great disparity. 
12
(26) African-American women are twice as like-
13
ly to experience postpartum depression, and dis-
14
proportionately higher rates of preeclampsia com-
15
pared to White women. 
16
(27) Racism is deeply ingrained in United 
17
States systems, including in health care delivery sys-
18
tems between patients and providers, often resulting 
19
in disparate treatment for pain, irreverence for cul-
20
tural 
norms 
with 
respect 
to 
health, 
and 
21
dismissiveness. Research has demonstrated that pa-
22
tients respond more warmly and adhere to medical 
23
treatment plans at a higher degree with providers of 
24
the same race or ethnicity or with providers with

great ability to exercise empathy. However, the pro-
1
vider pool is not primed with many people of color, 
2
nor are providers (whether student-doctors in train-
3
ing or licensed practitioners) consistently required to 
4
undergo implicit bias, cultural competency, or empa-
5
thy training on a consistent, on-going basis.
