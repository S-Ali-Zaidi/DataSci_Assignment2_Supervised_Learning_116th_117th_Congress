SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The rate of Americans dying by suicide is 
3
on the rise, increasing 10.7 to 14.0 deaths per 
4
100,000 people from 2001 to 2017. 
5
(2) Suicide is the tenth-leading cause of death 
6
among people in the United States and the second- 
7
leading cause of death for young people between the 
8
ages of 15 and 34. 
9
(3) The National Science Foundation funds re-
10
search that is improving our basic understanding of 
11
factors with potential relevance to suicide, including 
12
potential relevance to prevention and treatment. 
13
(4) Despite progress in mental health research, 
14
current gaps exist in scientific understanding and 
15
basic knowledge of human neural, genetic, cognitive, 
16
perceptual, behavioral, social, and environmental fac-
17
tors with potential relevance to suicide. 
18
SEC. 3. NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION RESEARCH.
