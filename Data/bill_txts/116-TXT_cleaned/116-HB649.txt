24
Congress makes the following findings: 
25
02:17 Feb 02, 2019
H649
3 
•HR 649 IH
(1) The Government of the People’s Republic of 
1
China (PRC) has a long history of repressing ap-
2
proximately 13,000,000 Turkic, moderate Sunni 
3
Muslims, particularly Uyghurs, in the nominally au-
4
tonomous Xinjiang region. These actions are in con-
5
travention of international human rights standards, 
6
including the Universal Declaration of Human 
7
Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and 
8
Political Rights, which China has signed but not yet 
9
ratified. 
10
(2) In recent decades, central and regional Chi-
11
nese government policies have systematically dis-
12
criminated against Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs, and 
13
other Muslims in Xinjiang by denying them a range 
14
of civil and political rights, including the freedoms of 
15
expression, religion, movement, and a fair trial, 
16
among others. 
17
(3) Increased unrest in the Xinjiang region as 
18
a result of the central government’s severe repres-
19
sion is used in Orwellian fashion by the Government 
20
of the People’s Republic of China as evidence of 
21
‘‘terrorism’’ and ‘‘separatism’’ and as an excuse for 
22
further disproportionate response. 
23
(4) In 2014, Chinese authorities launched their 
24
latest ‘‘Strike Hard against Violent Extremism’’

campaign, in which the pretext of wide-scale, inter-
1
nationally linked threats of terrorism were used to 
2
justify pervasive restrictions on, and gross human 
3
rights violations of, the ethnic minority communities 
4
of Xinjiang. 
5
(5) Those policies included— 
6
(A) pervasive, high-tech surveillance across 
7
the region, including the arbitrary collection of 
8
biodata, including DNA samples from children, 
9
without their knowledge or consent; 
10
(B) the use of QR codes outside homes to 
11
gather information on how frequently individ-
12
uals pray; 
13
(C) facial and voice recognition software 
14
and ‘‘predictive policing’’ databases; and 
15
(D) severe restrictions on the freedom of 
16
movement across the region. 
17
(6) Chinese security forces have never been held 
18
accountable for credible reports of mass shootings in 
19
Alaqagha (2014), Hanerik (2013), and Siriqbuya 
20
(2013), as well as the extrajudicial killings of 
21
Abdulbasit Ablimit (2013) and Rozi Osman (2014). 
22
(7)(A) The August 2016 transfer of former 
23
Tibet Autonomous Region Party Secretary Chen 
24
Quanguo to become the Xinjiang Party Secretary

prompted an acceleration in the crackdown across 
1
the region. 
2
(B) Local officials in Xinjiang have used 
3
chilling political rhetoric to describe the purpose of 
4
government policy including ‘‘eradicating tumors’’ 
5
and ‘‘spray[ing] chemicals’’ on crops to kill the 
6
‘‘weeds’’. 
7
(C) Uyghurs are forced to celebrate Chinese 
8
cultural traditions, such as Chinese New Year, and 
9
unique Uyghur culture is facing eradication due to 
10
state control over Uyghur cultural heritage, such as 
11
muqam (a musical tradition) and meshrep (tradi-
12
tional cultural gatherings), and due to elimination of 
13
the Uyghur language as a medium of instruction in 
14
Xinjiang schools and universities. 
15
(8) In 2017, credible reports found that family 
16
members of Uyghurs living outside of China had 
17
gone missing inside China, that Chinese authorities 
18
were pressuring those outside the country to return, 
19
and that individuals were being arbitrarily detained 
20
in large numbers. 
21
(9) There is ample credible evidence provided 
22
by scholars, human rights organizations, journalists, 
23
and think tanks substantiating the establishment by 
24
Chinese authorities of ‘‘political reeducation’’ camps.

Independent

conducted 
1
interviews, 
including 
testimonies 
from 
Kayrat

Samarkan, Omir Bekali, and Mihrigul Tursun, along 
3
with others who had been detained in such facilities, 
4
who described forced political indoctrination, torture, 
5
beatings, food deprivation, and solitary confinement, 
6
as well as uncertainty as to the length of detention, 
7
humiliation, and denial of religious, cultural, and lin-
8
guistic freedoms, and confirmed that they were told 
9
by guards that the only way to secure release was 
10

11

1
from Chinese officials. 
2
(12) Under pressure from the Government of 
3
the People’s Republic of China, countries have forc-
4
ibly returned Uyghurs to China in violation of the 
5
non-refoulement principle and their well-founded 
6
fear of persecution. States returning Uyghurs in-
7
clude Egypt (2017), the United Arab Emirates

10
(2009), Vietnam (2014), Kazakhstan (1999, 2001,

2003, 2006), Uzbekistan (2007), Tajikistan (2011), 
12
Pakistan (2003, 2009, 2011), Nepal (2002), and 
13
India (2016).

(13) Six journalists for Radio Free Asia’s 
15
Uyghur service have publicly detailed abuses their 
16
family members in Xinjiang have endured in re-
17
sponse to their work exposing abusive policies across 
18
the region.

conducting business with Xinjiang authorities with-
21
out sufficient due diligence or safeguards to ensure 
22
their business operations do not create or contribute

(15) The Government of the People’s Republic 
1
of China is increasingly investing in the ‘‘Belt and 
2
Road Initiative’’ across Xinjiang and throughout 
3
Central Asia, extending its influence through organi-
4
zations such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organiza-
5
tion without regard to the political, cultural, or lin-
6
guistic rights of ethnic minorities. 
7
(16) The Secretary of State, Congressional-Ex-
8
ecutive Commission on China, Tom Lantos Human 
9
Rights Commission, and individual members of the 
10
executive branch and Congress have all expressed 
11
growing concern regarding the pervasive human 
12
rights abuses across Xinjiang and the ‘‘political re-
13
education’’ camps. 
14
(17) In August 2018, the United Nations Com-
15
mittee to Eliminate Racial Discrimination challenged 
16
the Government of the People’s Republic of China 
17
over abuses in Xinjiang, including the establishment 
18
of mass arbitrary detention camps. 
19
(18) Between August and September 2018, 
20
Chinese authorities responded to these allegations by 
21
either flatly denying them or insisting that the facili-
22
ties are ‘‘vocational training centers’’.

Rights Michele Bachelet noted in her first speech as 
1
High Commissioner the ‘‘deeply disturbing allega-
2
tions of large-scale arbitrary detentions of Uighurs 
3
and other Muslim communities, in so-called re-edu-
4
cation camps across Xinjiang’’. 
5
(20) On September 18, 2018, the Washington 
6
Post editorial board wrote, ‘‘At stake is not just the 
7
welfare of the Uighurs, but also whether the tech-
8
nologies of the 21st century will be employed to 
9
smother human freedom.’’. 
10
(21) In December 2018 testimony before the 
11
Subcommittee on East Asia, the Pacific, and Inter-
12
national Cybersecurity Policy of the Committee on 
13
Foreign Relations of the Senate, Deputy Assistant 
14
Secretary for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor 
15
Scott Busby testified that the number of those de-
16
tained in camps since April 2017 was ‘‘at least 
17
800,000 and possibly more than 2 million’’. 
18
(22) In December 2018, independent media re-
19
ports pointed to growing evidence of forced labor in 
20
the camps, as well as reports of individuals who have 
21
been released from camps being forced to labor in 
22
nearby factories for low wages under threat of being 
23
sent back to ‘‘political reeducation’’ camps.

(23) In December 2018 and January 2019, 
1
Chinese officials organized visits to ‘‘political reedu-
2
cation’’ camps in Xinjiang for a small group of for-
3
eign journalists and diplomats from 12 non-Western 
4
countries. In the months preceding the visits, inter-
5
national media reported that officials worked to re-
6
move security features from some ‘‘political reeduca-
7
tion’’ facilities, and coached detainees and area resi-
8
dents not to make negative comments about the 
9
camps. Reports also indicated that officials had 
10
transferred large numbers of detainees to detention 
11
facilities in other parts of China. 
12
(24) Experts have described the Xinjiang region 
13
as ‘‘a police state to rival North Korea, with a for-
14
malized racism on the order of South African apart-
15
heid’’ and the repression in the Xinjiang region as 
16
a ‘‘slow motion Tiananmen’’.
