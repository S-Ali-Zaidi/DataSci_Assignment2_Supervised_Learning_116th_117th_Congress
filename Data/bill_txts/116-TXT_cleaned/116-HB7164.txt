Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Honoring Real Patri-
4
ots Act of 2020’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
The Congress makes the following findings: 
7
(1) The American Civil War of 1861–1865 was 
8
fought over the desire of the seceding States to keep 
9
human beings enslaved based upon their race. 
10
(2) The Confederacy was so committed to pre-
11
serving the institution of slavery that it killed more 
12
than 360,000 American soldiers in its failed effort to 
13
achieve this goal. 
14
(3) This act of treason was a direct attack on 
15
the existence of the United States and merits no 
16
honor to the Confederacy as an institution or its 
17
leaders as individuals by the United States Armed 
18
Forces. 
19
(4) Nonetheless, United States military installa-
20
tions and other property under the jurisdiction of 
21
the Department of Defense, including General Lee 
22
Avenue and Stonewall Jackson Drive at Fort Ham-
23
ilton, New York, remain named after rebels who 
24
took up arms against the United States.

(5) The United States Armed Forces are essen-
1
tial to defending the United States and protecting 
2
American values of freedom, equality, and demo-
3
cratic governance. 
4
(6) This role is undermined when military in-
5
stallations, facilities, roads, equipment, and other 
6
property are named after enemy combatants who 
7
took up arms during the Civil War to challenge the 
8
very values for which the United States stands. 
9
(7) Naming military property after armed in-
10
surrectionists with American blood on their hands is 
11
an affront to members of the Armed Forces, many 
12
of whom are people of color, who take an oath to 
13
protect and defend the Constitution. 
14
(8) There are an ample number of meritorious 
15
members of the Armed Forces, who loyally served 
16
the United States, for whom military property could 
17
and should be named.
