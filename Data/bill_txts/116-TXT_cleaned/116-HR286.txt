RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the United States remains committed to the North At-
lantic Treaty Organization. 
Whereas, for 70 years, the North Atlantic Treaty Organiza-
tion (NATO) has served as the world’s preeminent polit-
ical and military alliance committed to the collective de-
fense of its members and dedicated to ensuring the peace, 
security, and stability of the Euro-Atlantic area; 
Whereas NATO was founded on the principles of democracy, 
individual liberty, and the rule of law; 
Whereas the security of the United States is inseparable from 
the participation and leadership of the United States in 
NATO;

Whereas NATO continues to promote a Europe that is whole, 
free, and at peace; 
Whereas, since the end of the cold war, NATO has continued 
to redefine and transform itself and take on new missions 
and confront emerging threats such as terrorism, hybrid 
warfare, instability caused by failed states, cyber attacks, 
piracy, and threats to global energy security; 
Whereas after the 2001 terrorist attacks on the United 
States, article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, signed in 
Washington on April 4, 1949, was invoked for the first 
time in the history of the organization; 
Whereas NATO members subsequently deployed tens of thou-
sands of troops to Afghanistan to respond to a dangerous 
terrorist threat; 
Whereas European allies and Canada suffered approximately 
one-third of all fatalities suffered by NATO forces in Af-
ghanistan; 
Whereas NATO has worked to deter Russian aggression, in-
cluding responding to the illegal invasions and occupa-
tions of Georgia and Ukraine by the Russian Federation; 
Whereas the United States recognizes the significant in-
creases in allied national defense budgets following the 
Wales Summit in 2014 and continues to recognize allied 
burden-sharing as a critical component of collective de-
fense; 
Whereas NATO continues to support an open-door member-
ship policy of admitting any European country that can 
contribute to the promotion and protection of freedom, 
democracy, stability, and peace throughout Europe;
