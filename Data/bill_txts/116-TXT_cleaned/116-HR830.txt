RESOLUTION 
Congratulating the Kansas City Chiefs on their victory in 
Super Bowl LIV. 
Whereas, on February 2, 2020, the Kansas City Chiefs de-
feated the San Francisco 49ers by a score of 31 to 20, 
winning Super Bowl LIV at Hard Rock Stadium in 
Miami Gardens, Florida; 
Whereas this accomplishment marked the first Super Bowl 
championship for the Kansas City Chiefs since their last 
appearance 50 years ago in Super Bowl IV; 
Whereas quarterback Patrick Mahomes became only the third 
Black starting quarterback to win a Super Bowl as well 
as the youngest to have won both the Super Bowl and

Whereas quarterback Patrick Mahomes became the youngest 
quarterback to be named Super Bowl MVP and third 
youngest player of any position to achieve this honor; 
Whereas running back Damien Williams delivered 133 total 
yards, including a 38-yard touchdown run and a 5-yard 
touchdown catch, tying the Super Bowl record for most 
touchdowns in a single quarter; 
Whereas new hope was breathed into the team after wide re-
ceiver Tyreek Hill caught a 44-yard pass during an 83- 
yard drive that ended with tight end Travis Kelce catch-
ing a touchdown pass with only 6 minutes and 13 sec-
onds remaining; 
Whereas the Kansas City Chiefs overcame a 10-point deficit 
with less than 7 minutes left to win the game, becoming 
the first team in the history of the National Football 
League (NFL) to trail each postseason game by 10 or 
more points and still overcome the odds to win each of 
the 3 games; 
Whereas their 21 points scored in the fourth quarter tied a 
Super Bowl record and was complemented by a powerful 
defense that continued to stop the San Francisco 49ers 
offense and allow for the comeback victory to occur; 
Whereas this was the 222nd win for head coach Andy Reid 
in his NFL coaching history, a record for most wins be-
fore capturing his first championship; 
Whereas each of the 53 players on the roster deserves rec-
ognition, including Nick Allegretti, Jackson Barton, 
Blake Bell, Bashaud Breeland, Alex Brown, Harrison 
Butker, Morris Claiborne, Frank Clark, Dustin Colquitt, 
Laurent Duvernay-Tardif, Cam Erving, Rashad Fenton, 
Eric Fisher, Kendall Fuller, Mecole Hardman, Demone

as well as the fans of the team in Missouri, the rest of

Resolved, That the House of Representatives con-
