al-Nujaba (Nujaba) is an affiliated faction of AAH 
1
and the United States-designated foreign terrorist 
2
organization Kata’ib Hizballah that was formed in 
3
2013. 
4
(2) AAH and Nujaba are provided training, 
5
funding, and arms by the Iranian Islamic Revolu-
6
tionary Guard Corps (IRGC), IRGC-Quds Force, 
7
and mentored by Lebanese Hizballah. AAH leader, 
8
Qais Khazali, has pledged allegiance to Iran’s Su-
9
preme Leader Ali Khamenei. 
10
(3) AAH conducted numerous attacks against 
11
the United States and coalition forces in Iraq be-
12
tween its inception in 2006 and the United States 
13
withdrawal in December 2011. This includes the 
14
January 20, 2007, attack on the Karbala Provincial 
15
Headquarters that resulted in the killing of CPT 
16
Brian S. Freeman, 1LT Jacob N. Fritz, SPC Jona-
17
than B. Chism, PFC Shawn P. Falter, and PFC 
18
Jonathon M. Millican—four of whom were abducted 
19
and later executed. 
20
(4) AAH and Nujaba deploy forces to Syria to 
21
fight on behalf of the Bashar al-Assad regime, in-
22
cluding participating in the 2016 siege of Aleppo

Human Rights alleges pro-government Iraqi militia 
1
groups executed dozens of civilians. 
2
(5) In 2015, Human Rights Watch alleged 
3
AAH participated in forced evictions, kidnappings, 
4
and extrajudicial killings of Sunni and Kurdish civil-
5
ians in areas liberated from the Islamic State. 
6
(6) Nujaba is led by Akram al-Kabi, who was 
7
designated by the Department of the Treasury under 
8
Executive Order 13438 for threatening the peace 
9
and stability of Iraq. According to the United States 
10
Government, Kabi participated in multiple mortar 
11
and rocket attacks on the International Zone, or 
12
Green Zone, in Baghdad in early 2008. Kabi and 
13
other Nujaba commanders have claimed they follow 
14
orders from Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei 
15
and declared in March 2016 support for Lebanese 
16
Hizballah. 
17
(7) In 2017, a Nujaba spokesman declared that 
18
it had formed a unit tasked to ‘‘liberate’’ the Golan 
19
Heights from Israeli control and reports indicate the 
20
group is playing a key role in securing a land route 
21
between Iran and Lebanon to provide military aid to 
22
Lebanese Hezbollah.
