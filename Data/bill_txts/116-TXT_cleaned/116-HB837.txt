A BILL 
To authorize a special resource study on the spread vectors 
of chronic wasting disease in Cervidae, and for other 
purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Chronic Wasting Dis-
4
ease Transmission in Cervidae Study Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress makes the following findings:

•HR 837 IH
(1) Chronic wasting disease continues to spread 
1
in wild, free-ranging cervid herds and in captive 
2
cervid herds across the United States and Canada, 
3
and as of December 2018, is in 26 States and three 
4
Canadian provinces. 
5
(2) From December 2017 to December 2018 
6
alone, the disease was detected for the first time in 
7
free-ranging cervid herds in Mississippi, Montana, 
8
and Tennessee, and there were new positive detec-
9
tions of the disease in 13 captive cervid herds from 
10
Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, 
11
Wisconsin and Quebec, Canada. 
12
(3) Six of such herds are being monitored by 
13
the National Chronic Wasting Disease Herd Certifi-
14
cation Program of the Animal and Plant Health In-
15
spection Service, and therefore are considered to be 
16
at low-risk for chronic wasting disease. 
17
(4) From June 2017 to September 2018, 10 
18
States, including Arkansas, Illinois, Kansas, Min-
19
nesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Texas, West Virginia, 
20
Wisconsin, and Wyoming, are already fighting to 
21
control the transmission and spread of chronic wast-
22
ing disease and found positive detections for the dis-
23
ease in additional wild, free-ranging cervid herds. 
24

•HR 837 IH
(5) New positive detections in captive cervid 
1
herds were found in Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, 
2
Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. 
3
(6) There is no known cure for chronic wasting 
4
disease, no reliable live animal test to detect the dis-
5
ease, and only a post-mortem test that provides 
6
some measure of reliable detection of the disease. 
7
(7) Chronic wasting disease is 100 percent fatal 
8
and is arguably the most important disease threat-
9
ening North American cervid resources. 
10
(8) The spread of chronic wasting disease con-
11
tinues to increasingly and adversely affect the eco-
12
nomic well-being of rural communities, the hunting 
13
public, farmed cervid producers, and State wildlife 
14
and agricultural agencies, because the only known 
15
measure for reducing the spread of chronic wasting 
16
disease is the complete depopulation of herds that 
17
test positive for the disease, a drastic measure which 
18
comes with great costs for all. 
19
(9) The long-term environmental persistence of 
20
chronic wasting disease’s causative agent means that 
21
State wildlife management agencies, State depart-
22
ments of agriculture, and private cervid farmers 
23
have relatively few options to mitigate the effects of 
24
such disease.

•HR 837 IH
(10) There are ongoing debates about the pre-
1
dominant transmission pathways that are causing 
2
the new detections and continued spread of chronic 
3
wasting disease in cervids across the United States 
4
and Canada.

(a) STUDY.— 
8
(1) IN GENERAL.—The Secretaries shall enter 
9
into an arrangement with the Academy under which 
10
the Academy shall conduct, and submit to the Secre-
11
taries a report— 
12
(A) describing the findings of, a special re-
13
source study to identify the predominant path-
14
ways and mechanisms of the transmission of 
15
chronic wasting disease in wild, captive, and 
16
farmed populations of cervids in the United 
17
States; and 
18
(B) which may include the potential im-
19
pacts on the disease from transmissions from 
20
Canada. 
21
(2) REQUIREMENTS.—The arrangement under 
22
paragraph (1) shall provide that the actual expenses

(b) CONTENTS OF THE STUDY.—Within and between 
3
wild, captive, and farmed cervid populations, the study— 
4
(1) may include, to the extent the United States 
5
is affected on a continental scale, the potential im-
6
pacts on the disease from transmissions from Can-
7
ada; and 
8
(2) shall— 
9
(A) identify— 
10
(i) the pathways and mechanisms for 
11
the transmission of chronic wasting disease 
12
in cervids and cervid products; 
13
(ii) the dosage and infection rates for 
14
each such pathway and mechanism; and 
15
(iii) the relative frequency of each 
16
mode of such transmission; 
17
(B) identify anthropogenic and environ-
18
mental factors contributing to new chronic 
19
wasting disease emergence events, the develop-
20
ment of geographic areas with increased chronic 
21
wasting disease prevalence, and overall geo-
