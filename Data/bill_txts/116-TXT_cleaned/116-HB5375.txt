A BILL 
To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow the 
energy credit for certain ocean thermal energy equipment. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.

(a) SHORT TITLE.—This Act may be cited as the ‘‘E. 
4
Cooper Brown Ocean Clean Energy Act of 2019’’.

(b) FINDINGS RELATED TO OCEAN THERMAL EN-
6
ERGY CONVERSION.—Congress finds the following with re-
7
spect to ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC):

(1) OTEC is a clean energy technology that 
1
produces energy by using temperature differentials 
2
between cooler deep and warm surface seawaters. 
3
(2) OTEC technology has the potential to 
4
produce massive levels of clean energy to generate 
5
electricity. 
6
(3) Deployment of OTEC technology will reduce 
7
greenhouse gases and reliance on fossil fuels. 
8
(4) In tropical and subtropical remote locations, 
9
electricity is expensive to generate. Power generated 
10
from OTEC technology will be inexpensive when 
11
compared to the unit cost of power from a tradi-
12
tional oil based electrical generation system. 
13
(5) OTEC generated energy would reduce oper-
14
ational costs for remote military bases such as Kwaj-
15
alein and Diego Garcia;. 
16
(6) The United States became involved in 
17
OTEC research in 1974 with the establishment of 
18
the Natural Energy Laboratory of Hawaii Authority. 
19
The laboratory is one of the world’s leading test fa-
20
cilities for OTEC technology. The United States 
21
Navy supported the development of a 105 kW dem-
22
onstration OTEC plant at the laboratory site. This 
23
facility became operational in 2015 and supplies 
24
electricity to the local electricity grid.

(7) In certain regions, onshore OTEC plants 
1
are also feasible and they can be configured to sup-
2
port seawater or lake water air conditioning (SWAC/ 
3
LWAC) systems for refrigeration and cooling, agri-
4
culture, and desalination systems for water purifi-
5
cation. 
6
(8) Economic benefits of OTEC include reduced 
7
fuel imports, stable utilities pricing, reduced capital 
8
expense to power companies and governments, and 
9
significant energy costs savings. 
10
(9) Social benefits of OTEC include and an 
11
ability to produce freshwater and promotion of aqua-
12
culture. 
13
(c) FINDINGS RELATED TO SEAWATER AIR CONDI-
14
TIONING.—Congress finds the following with respect to 
15
seawater air conditioning (SWAC): 
16
(1) SWAC is an alternate-energy system that 
17
uses the cold water from the deep ocean (and in 
18
some cases a deep lake) to cool buildings. 
19
(2) SWAC was developed as a secondary benefit 
20
in the development of ocean thermal energy conver-
21
sion (OTEC) and can be used in conjunction with an 
22
OTEC system or as a standalone alternate energy 
23
system.

(3) The basic process involves water that is 
1
pumped from a deep cold-water source (ocean or 
2
lake) and then passed through a heat exchanger. A 
3
closed-loop freshwater water distribution system is 
4
pumped through a heat exchanger cooling the water 
5
and the cooled water is distributed throughout a 
6
building or group of buildings (i.e., a district cooling 
7
system). 
8
(4) The SWAC technology has been proven suc-
9
cessful with large systems at Cornell University, To-
10
ronto, Canada, and the Natural Energy Authority of 
11
Hawaii (NELHA). 
12
(5) Environmental benefits of SWAC include 
13
being a clean, renewable source of energy, decreased 
14
reliance on fossil fuels for cooling, and reduction in 
15
greenhouse gas emissions. 
16
(6) Economic benefits of SWAC include stable 
17
long-term energy costs and independence from mar-
18
ket trends, reduced operating costs (including lower 
19
costs in fuel, freshwater, equipment, and equipment 
20
maintenance), and being a cost-effective and attrac-
21
tive energy technology investment.

SEC. 2. ENERGY CREDIT FOR CERTAIN OCEAN THERMAL 
1
ENERGY PROPERTY. 
2
(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 48(a)(3)(A) of the Inter-
3
nal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by striking ‘‘or’’ 
4
at the end of clause (vi), by adding ‘‘or’’ at the end of 
5
clause (vii), and by adding at the end the following new 
6
clause: 
7
‘‘(viii) 
equipment 
which 
converts 
8
ocean thermal energy to usable energy or 
9
which uses ocean water as a thermal en-
10
ergy sink to cool a structure,’’. 
11
(b) 15-PERCENT CREDIT.—Section 48(a)(2)(A) of 
12
such Code is amended— 
13
(1) by striking ‘‘and’’ at the end of clause 
14
(i)(IV); 
15
(2) by redesignating clause (ii) as clause (iii); 
16
(3) by striking ‘‘any energy property to which 
17
clause (i) does not apply’’ in clause (iii) (as so redes-
18
ignated) and inserting ‘‘any other energy property’’; 
19
and 
20
(4) by inserting after clause (i) the following 
21
new clause: 
22
