SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) On July 4, 1776, the Second Continental 
3
Congress unanimously declared the independence of 
4
the 13 colonies, and the achievement of peace was 
5
recognized as one of the highest duties of the new 
6
organization of free and independent States by de-
7
claring, ‘‘We hold these truths to be self-evident, 
8
that all men are created equal, that they are en-
9
dowed by their Creator with certain unalienable 
10
Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the 
11
pursuit of Happiness.’’. 
12
(2) The Constitution of the United States, in 
13
its preamble, further sets forth the insurance of the 
14
cause of peace in stating, ‘‘We the People of the 
15
United States, in Order to form a more perfect 
16
Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tran-

quility, provide for the common defence, promote the 
1
general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty 
2
to ourselves and our Posterity’’. 
3
(3) The United States has been at peace for 
4
only 21 entire years since its birth during the Revo-
5
lutionary War. During the course of the 20th cen-
6
tury, more than 100,000,000 people perished in 
7
wars. Many of our citizens today have never known 
8
a peaceful year in their lifetimes. 
9
(4) Thus far in the 21st century, nearly 
10
1,000,000 people have died in conflict and war. In 
11
2017 alone, 68.5 million people, or one person in 
12
110, were displaced from their homes by conflict and 
13
persecution. The United States has been at war over 
14
15 years, with more than 6,800 members of the 
15
Armed Forces and hundreds of thousands of civil-
16
ians estimated to have been killed in the conflicts in 
17
Iraq, Afghanistan, and territories occupied by ISIL. 
18
(5) Every year more than 300,000 people are 
19
killed by gun violence around the world. In 2017, 
20
nearly 40,000 people died in the United States as a 
21
result of gun violence; the highest number of gun 
22
deaths in nearly 50 years. The rate of deaths—12 
23
fatal shootings per 100,000 residents—is also at the 
24
highest point since the mid-1990s. Approximately 20 
25
02:40 Feb 26, 2019

•HR 1111 IH
veterans a day commit suicide nationwide. Every 
1
day, 47 children and teens are shot, and each gun 
2
injury and fatality results in trauma to family mem-
3
bers and loved ones. More people have died from 
4
guns in the United States since 1968 than on battle-
5
fields of all the wars in United States history. 
6
(6) A World Health Organization report esti-
7
mates that interpersonal violence within the United 
8
States costs approximately $300 billion annually, not 
9
including war-related costs. The Centers for Disease 
10
Control and Prevention found that the total eco-
11
nomic cost of child abuse and neglect is estimated 
12
at $124 billion each year. 
13
(7) According to a report by the Institute of 
14
Economics and Peace, which measures the economic 
15
impact of violence and conflict to the global econ-
16
omy, the economic impact of violence to the global 
17
economy was $14.76 trillion in 2017. The report 
18
also found that the regional impact of violence in 
19
North America, 99 percent of which can be attrib-
20
uted to the United States, amounted to $2.73 tril-
21
lion in 2017. 
22
(8) A 2015 study by the Institute for Econom-
23
ics and Peace reports conservative estimates that 12 
24
percent of the gross domestic product of the United 
25
02:40 Feb 26, 2019
H1111
5 
•HR 1111 IH
States was spent on containing violence. The study 
1
included government, corporate, and individual ex-
2
penditures, regardless of whether the expenditure 
3
was related to international affairs such as offshore 
4
military activities, or domestic spending such as 
5
dealing with crime and the consequences of crime. 
6
(9) Violence prevention is cost effective. For 
7
every dollar spent on violence prevention and 
8
peacebuilding, thousands of lives and dollars are 
9
saved. Research indicates that investing early to pre-
10
vent conflicts from escalating into violent crises is, 
11
on average, 60 times more cost effective than inter-
12
vening after violence erupts. The philosophy and 
13
techniques of nonviolence and the science of 
14
peacebuilding provide tools and techniques that can 
15
be applied not only at the levels of individual and 
16
community growth, but also within the Federal Gov-
17
ernment and at national and international levels. 
18
(10) The United Nations recognizes that pro-
19
motion of peace is vital for the full enjoyment of all 
20
human rights and the United Nations Declaration 
21
on the Right of Peoples to Peace mandates that 
22
preservation of the right to peace is a fundamental 
23
obligation of each country. In 1999, the United Na-
24
tions adopted a Programme of Action on a Culture 
25
02:40 Feb 26, 2019
H1111

•HR 1111 IH
of Peace, stating that a culture of peace is an inte-
1
gral approach to preventing violence and violent con-
2
flicts, an alternative to the culture of war and vio-
3
lence, and is based on education for peace, the pro-
4
motion of sustainable economic and social develop-
5
ment, respect for human rights, equality between 
6
women and men, democratic participation, tolerance, 
7
and the free flow of information and disarmament. 
8
The United Nations declared the years 2001 
9
through 2010 an International Decade for a Culture 
10
of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the 
11
World, and the United Nations supports a culture of 
12
peace. In 2015, the UN adopted 17 sustainable de-
13
velopment goals, including promotion of peaceful and 
14
inclusive societies. 
15
(11) Peacebuilding is defined by the United Na-
16
tions as a range of measures targeted to reduce the 
17
risk of lapsing or relapsing into conflict by strength-
18
ening national capacities at all levels for conflict 
19
management and to lay the foundations for sustain-
20
able peace and development. Peacebuilding is built 
21
upon research into the root causes of violence in the 
22
United States and the world, through promotion and 
23
promulgation of effective policies and programs that 
24
ameliorate those root causes of violence, and through 
25

•HR 1111 IH
providing all citizens, organizations, and govern-
1
mental bodies with opportunities to learn about and 
2
practice the essential tools of nonviolent conflict res-
3
olution and peacebuilding. 
4
(12) In 2000, the Earth Charter Commission 
5
released the Earth Charter, an international declara-
6
tion of fundamental values and principles created to 
7
build a just, sustainable, and peaceful global society. 
8
The preamble of the Earth Charter provides, ‘‘To 
9
move forward we must recognize that in the midst 
10
of a magnificent diversity of cultures and life forms 
11
we are one human family and one Earth community 
12
with a common destiny. We must join together to 
13
bring forth a sustainable global society founded on 
14
respect for nature, universal human rights, economic 
15
justice, and a culture of peace.’’. Peacebuilding is 
16
working together with all countries to protect both 
17
life and land and hold the Earth in balance.
