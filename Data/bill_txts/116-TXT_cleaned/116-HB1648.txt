Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Small businesses represent more than 97 
8
percent of total businesses in the United States and 
9

make up an essential part of the supply chain to 
1
some of the largest companies, many of which are in 
2
critical infrastructure sectors, from financial and 
3
transportation organizations to power, water, and 
4
healthcare suppliers. 
5
(2) Many small businesses do not have dedi-
6
cated information technology (‘‘IT’’) departments 
7
and must outsource IT functions or assign these du-
8
ties to an employee as a secondary function. 
9
(3) The Internet Crime Complaint Center with-
10
in the United States Department of Justice recorded 
11
298,728 cybersecurity-related complaints in its 2016 
12
report. 
13
(4) There has been steady increases of cyberse-
14
curity-related complaints year over year since the 
15
year 2000, totaling 3,762,348. 
16
(5) Seventy-one percent of cyber attacks oc-
17
curred in businesses with fewer than 100 employees. 
18
(6) Only 14 percent of small- and medium-sized 
19
businesses believe they have the ability to effectively 
20
mitigate cyber risks and vulnerabilities. 
21
(7) Small businesses risk theft and manipula-
22
tion of sensitive data if they lack adequate cyberse-
23
curity measures.

•HR 1648 IH
(8) The Better Business Bureau found that 
1
half of small businesses could remain profitable for 
2
only one month if they lost essential data. 
3
(9) Cyber crime is growing rapidly and the an-
4
nual costs to the global economy are estimated to 
5
reach over $2,000,000,000,000 by 2019. 
6
(10) Cybersecurity is a global challenge where 
7
the security threat, attacks, and techniques contin-
8
ually evolve and no company, individual, or Federal 
9
agency is immune from these threats. 
10
(11) Strong collaboration between the public 
11
and private sector is essential in the fight against 
12
cyber crime. 
13
(12) There is a reluctance among small busi-
14
nesses to voluntarily share information with govern-
15
ment entities, and the Federal Government should 
16
work proactively to incentivize and encourage vol-
17
untary information sharing to improve the Nation’s 
18
cybersecurity posture.
