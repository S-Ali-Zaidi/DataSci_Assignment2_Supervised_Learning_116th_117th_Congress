SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Eight million metric tons of plastic enter 
3
the ocean every year. Marine debris damages the 
4
health of marine life, impedes local economic devel-
5
opment, and threatens health systems. Ten river sys-
6
tems carry an estimated 90 percent of the plastic 
7
waste that ends up in the ocean. 
8
(2) Mismanaged plastic waste has the highest 
9
risk of contaminating rivers and oceans. China con-
10
tributes the largest share of this mismanaged waste, 
11
followed by Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, 
12
Thailand, Egypt, Nigeria, and South Africa. The 
13
United States is the world’s second-largest producer 
14
and consumer of plastics products, and the top ex-
15
porter of plastic scrap. 
16
(3) Most marine debris, particularly plastics, 
17
enters the oceans from land-based sources, mainly in 
18
developing countries, that lack the capacity to ade-
19
quately manage waste and prevent dumping. 
20
(4) During the Our Ocean Conference in Octo-
21
ber 2018, the United States announced assistance to 
22
prevent marine debris from entering the ocean 
23
through development of waste management systems 
24
and reduce plastics in marine protected areas in the 
25
Indo-Pacific.

(5) During the June 2019 G20 Summit in 
1
Osaka, Japan, the United States joined other G20 
2
members in endorsing the ‘‘Osaka Blue Ocean Vi-
3
sion’’ to reduce additional pollution by marine plas-
4
tic litter to zero by 2050 and the G20 Implementa-
5
tion Framework for Actions on Marine Plastic Lit-
6
ter, which outlines a commitment to prevent and re-
7
duce plastic debris in the oceans through waste man-
8
agement and clean-up efforts to remove marine plas-
9
tic debris and prioritizes efforts to advance innova-
10
tive solutions and international cooperation to sup-
11
port such initiatives. 
12
SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
13
It is the policy of the United States to consult, part-
14
ner, and coordinate with the governments of foreign coun-
15
tries, international organizations, private and civil society 
16
entities, and other stakeholders in a concerted effort to— 
17
(1) prevent and reduce marine debris and plas-
18
tic waste, including through reduced consumption, 
19
greater transparency in global trade of plastic waste, 
20
and support for integrated waste management sys-
21
tems in developing countries; 
22
(2) advance innovative market-based solutions 
23
and catalyze private capital to prevent and reduce

marine debris and plastic waste, support integrated

waste management systems, and improve market de-
1
mand for recycled material; 
2
(3) build the capacity of national and sub-
3
national governments in other countries to develop 
4
and implement integrated waste management sys-
5
tems, measure and report progress in reducing plas-
6
tic waste, and prevent plastic waste from entering 
7
rivers and oceans; 
8
(4) support local economic development through 
9
programs that assist community members, particu-
10
larly women, youth, and marginalized populations, to 
11
derive economic benefit from waste products and 
12
participation in waste management systems; and 
13
(5) engage in international and regional co-
14
operation to prevent and reduce marine debris and 
15
plastic waste, share best practices, and empower na-
16
tional and subnational governments, local commu-
17
nities, civil society, and the private sector to engage 
18
in such efforts. 
19
SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
20
It is the sense of Congress that, in pursuing the pol-
21
icy described in section 3, the President should direct 
22
United States representatives to appropriate international 
23
bodies to use the voice, vote, and influence of the United 
24
States to advocate support for the following:
