and safety of the students of the United States;

opment and better health outcomes in children and ado-

orders such as delayed sleep-wake phase disorder, insom-
nia, obstructive sleep apnea, and restless legs syndrome; 
Whereas the new, unknown, and rapidly changing realities of 
the COVID–19 pandemic have caused widespread sleep 
disturbances in children; 
Whereas the amount of sleep needed to promote optimal 
health in children and adolescents varies by age; 
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the 
American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy 
of Sleep Medicine, and the Sleep Research Society rec-
ommend that teenagers sleep 8 to 10 hours per 24 hours 
on a regular basis to promote optimal health; 
Whereas data collected by the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention show that 75 percent of high school stu-
dents in the United States report getting insufficient 
sleep on school nights; 
Whereas the average sleep duration reported by adolescents 
varies by race, with a higher percentage of Black high 
school students reporting insufficient sleep on school 
nights than White and Latino students; 
Whereas shifts in biological rhythms during puberty causes 
adolescents to become sleepy later at night and wake up 
later in the morning; 
Whereas insufficient sleep, erratic sleep and wake schedules, 
late bedtimes, and poor sleep quality are associated with 
worse school performance for adolescents; 
Whereas insufficient sleep increases the risk of accidents, in-
juries, hypertension, obesity, diabetes, and depression;

Whereas insufficient sleep in teenagers is associated with an 
increased risk of self-harm, suicidal thoughts, and suicide 
attempts; 
Whereas the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Pro-
motion at the Department of Health and Human Serv-
ices seeks to increase the proportion of students in grades 
9 through 12 who get sufficient sleep as part of Healthy 
People 2020, a Federal initiative to improve the health 
of all Americans; 
Whereas the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American 
Medical Association, and the American Academy of Sleep 
Medicine recommends that middle school and high school 
start times should be 8:30 a.m. or later to promote stu-
dent health and performance; 
Whereas data show that 83 percent of middle schools and 93 
percent of high schools in the United States start before 
8:30 a.m.; 
Whereas insufficient sleep in teenagers is associated with an 
increased risk of drinking and driving, texting while driv-
ing, and drowsy driving; 
Whereas the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 
considers drowsy driving to be a profound impairment 
that mimics alcohol-impaired driving in many ways, in-
cluding slower reaction times and impaired attention, 
mental processing, judgement, and decision making; 
Whereas the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety estimates 
that drowsy driving causes an average of 328,000 motor 
vehicle accidents in the United States each year, includ-
ing 6,400 fatal crashes;

Whereas drivers between 16 and 24 years of age are 80 per-
cent more likely to be involved in a drowsy driving crash 
than adults who are 40 years of age or older; 
Whereas Congress established the National Center on Sleep 
Disorders Research in 1993 to foster the coordination of 
sleep and circadian research within the National Insti-
tutes of Health and other Federal agencies; 
Whereas sleep medicine is a multi-disciplinary medical spe-
cialty 
involving 
internal 
medicine 
physicians, 
pulmonologists, 
neurologists, 
psychiatrists, 
otolaryngologists, family physicians, pediatricians, anes-
thesiologists, dentists, psychologists, advanced practice 
providers, sleep technologists, and other health care pro-
fessionals; and 
Whereas more sleep and circadian research is needed to help 
improve the treatment of sleep disorders and reduce sleep 
health disparities in children and adolescents: Now, 
therefore, be it
