•HR 2354 IH
(1) Article I, Section 8, of the Constitution of 
1
the United States grants Congress the sole power to 
2
declare war. 
3
(2) President George Washington, in a letter to 
4
William Moultrie dated August 28, 1793, wrote that 
5
‘‘[t]he constitution vests the power of declaring war 
6
in Congress; therefore no offensive expedition of im-
7
portance can be undertaken until after they shall 
8
have deliberated upon the subject and authorized 
9
such a measure’’. 
10
(3) Alexander Hamilton wrote in Examination 
11
Number 1 of the Hamilton Papers, dated December 
12
17, 1801, that ‘‘ ‘[t]he Congress shall have the 
13
power to declare war’; the plain meaning of which is, 
14
that it is the peculiar and exclusive duty of Con-
15
gress, when the nation is at peace, to change that 
16
state into a state of war’’. 
17
(4) Iran’s support for terrorism presents a seri-
18
ous threat to the United States and our allies in the 
19
Middle East, Europe, and Asia. 
20
(5) Missile tests by Iran have led to escalating 
21
tensions with Israel, Saudi Arabia, the United 
22
States, and the United Nations. 
23
(6) Iran has threatened to shutdown crucial 
24
maritime lines of communication, putting United

States and international naval assets, as well as 
1
global energy assets, at risk. 
2
(7) According to the intelligence assessments of 
3
the United States, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of 
4
Action curtailed enrichment and prevented proc-
5
essing of fissile materials by Iran to levels which 
6
would preclude Iran from developing a nuclear weap-
7
on. 
8
(8) The International Atomic Energy Agency 
9
has repeatedly verified that Iran has continued to 
10
comply with its nuclear-related obligations as re-
11
quired by the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. 
12
(9) Noncompliance by the United States with 
13
the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action risks an un-
14
necessary conflagration with Iran through the use of 
15
sanctions against both allies and adversaries in the 
16
region and throughout the world, absent a clear dip-
17
lomatic path for resolving the crisis. 
18
(10) A war with Iran would also endanger 
19
United States assets, personnel, and foreign policy 
20
objectives throughout the region, including in Iraq, 
21
Afghanistan, and Israel. 
22
(11) President Trump tweeted that Iran ‘‘[w]ill 
23
suffer consequences the likes of which few through-
24
out history have ever suffered before’’.

•HR 2354 IH
(12) Loose talk of war and belligerent rhetoric 
1
increases the risk of miscalculation by either side 
2
and unsettles United States allies. 
3
(13) Section 2(c) of the War Powers Resolution 
4
(50 U.S.C. 1541(c)) states that ‘‘[t]he constitutional 
5
powers of the President as Commander-in-Chief to 
6
introduce United States Armed Forces into hos-
7
tilities, or into situations where imminent involve-
8
ment in hostilities is clearly indicated by the cir-
9
cumstances, are exercised only pursuant to (1) a 
10
declaration of war, (2) specific statutory authoriza-
11
tion, or (3) a national emergency created by attack 
12
upon the United States, its territories or posses-
13
sions, or its armed forces’’.

15
TARY OPERATIONS IN OR AGAINST IRAN.

11
restrictions on the use of force or reporting requirements 
12
set forth in the War Powers Resolution (50 U.S.C. 1541
