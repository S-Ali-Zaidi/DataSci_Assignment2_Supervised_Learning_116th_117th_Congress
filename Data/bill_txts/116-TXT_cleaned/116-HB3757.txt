A BILL 
To require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint coins 
in commemoration of the centennial of the minting of 
the Morgan dollar and the Peace dollar. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘1921 Silver Dollar 
4
Commemorative Coin Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) The United States of America entered the 
8
First World War when it declared war against Ger-
9
many on April 6, 1917.

(2) The armed hostilities ceased on November 
1
11, 1918, the ‘‘11th hour of the 11th day of the 
2
11th month’’. 
3
(3) The First World War effectively ended on 
4
June 28, 1919, with the Treaty of Versailles, but 
5
the United States Senate failed to ratify that treaty 
6
and later ratified a peace agreement with Germany 
7
on October 21, 1921. 
8
(4) Over 4,700,000 American military per-
9
sonnel served during the First World War with 
10
116,516 sacrificing their lives for freedom and an-
11
other 204,002 wounded. 
12
(5) In December 1921, the Peace silver dollar 
13
(in this Act referred to as the ‘‘Peace dollar’’) was 
14
approved by Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon, re-
15
placing the Morgan silver dollar (in this Act referred 
16
to as the ‘‘Morgan dollar’’) and commemorating the 
17
declaration of peace between the United States and 
18
the Imperial German government. 
19
(6) The Peace dollar was designed by Anthony 
20
de Francisci with the Goddess of Liberty on the ob-
21
verse and a bald eagle clutching the olive branch (a 
22
symbol of peace) on the reverse. The Peace dollars 
23
were minted between 1921–1935.

(7) The Morgan dollar was designed by George 
1
T. Morgan and was minted from 1878 to 1904, and 
2
again in 1921. The obverse depicts a profile portrait 
3
of Lady Liberty and on the reverse, a heraldic eagle. 
4
(8) The conversion from the Morgan dollar to 
5
the Peace dollar design in 1921 reflected a pivotal 
6
moment in American history. The Morgan dollar 
7
represents the country’s westward expansion and in-
8
dustrial development in the late 19th century. The 
9
Peace dollar symbolizes the country’s coming of age 
10
as an international power while recognizing the sac-
11
rifices made by her citizens in World War I and cele-
12
brating the victory and peace that ensued. 
13
(9) These iconic silver dollars with vastly dif-
14
ferent representations of Lady Liberty and the 
15
American Eagle, reflect a changing of the guard in 
16
1921 in the United States and therefore on the 
17
100th anniversary must be minted again to com-
18
memorate this significant evolution of American 
19
freedom.
