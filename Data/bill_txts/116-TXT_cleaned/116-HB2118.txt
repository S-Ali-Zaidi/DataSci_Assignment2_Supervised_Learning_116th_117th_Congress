(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:

12
2231 (2015)— 
13
04:19 Apr 17, 2019
H2118

•HR 2118 IH
(A) calls upon Iran ‘‘not to undertake any 
1
activity related to ballistic missiles designed to 
2
be capable of delivering nuclear weapons, in-
3
cluding launches using such ballistic missile 
4
technology’’; and 
5
(B) requires member states to ‘‘take the 
6
necessary measures to prevent, except as de-
7
cided otherwise by the UN Security Council in 
8
advance on a case-by-case basis, the supply, 
9
sale, or transfer of arms or related materiel 
10
from Iran’’. 
11
(2) The United States maintains bilateral sanc-
12
tions against Iran for its efforts to manufacture, ac-
13
quire, possess, develop, transport, transfer or use 
14
ballistic missiles or ballistic missile launch tech-
15
nology, and its acquisition of destabilizing types and 
16
amounts of conventional weapons. 
17
(3) According to the 2016 Worldwide Threat 
18
Assessment, the United States intelligence commu-
19
nity judges ‘‘that Tehran would choose ballistic mis-
20
siles as its preferred method of delivering nuclear 
21
weapons, if it builds them. Iran’s ballistic missiles 
22
are inherently capable of delivering [weapons of 
23
mass destruction], and Tehran already has the larg-
24
est inventory of ballistic missiles in the Middle East. 
25

•HR 2118 IH
Iran’s progress on space launch vehicles—along with 
1
its desire to deter the United States and its allies— 
2
provides Tehran with the means and motivation to 
3
develop longer-range missiles, including ICBMs.’’. 
4
(4) Since the passage of United Nations Secu-
5
rity Council 2231, Iran has conducted numerous 
6
tests of ballistic missiles designed to be capable of 
7
delivering nuclear weapons, and has acquired desta-
8
bilizing types of conventional weapons. 
9
(5) Iran has pursued the ability to indigenously 
10
produce ballistic missile and cruise missile goods, 
11
services, and technologies. 
12
(b) STATEMENT OF POLICY.—It is the policy of the 
13
United States to prevent Iran from undertaking any activ-
14
ity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of 
15
delivering nuclear weapons, including launches using such 
16
ballistic missile technology.
