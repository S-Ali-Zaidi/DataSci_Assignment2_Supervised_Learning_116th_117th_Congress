(2) Born on January 29, 1820, Tubman was a 
1
notable abolitionist who not only freed herself, but 
2
also freed others from slavery. 
3
(3) Harriet Ross Tubman, born Araminta 
4
‘‘Minty’’ Ross, was born a slave in the plantation of 
5
Edward Brodess in Dorchester County, Maryland. 
6
(4) With the Underground Railroad System, in 
7
the fall of 1849, Tubman escaped from the Poplar 
8
Neck Plantation, heading north to Pennsylvania. 
9
(5) With the passing of the Fugitive Slave Law 
10
as part of the Compromise of 1850, the operations 
11
to help enslaved persons escape became a threat to 
12
her life. 
13
(6) Despite the passing of the Compromise of 
14
1850 and the Fugitive Slave Law, Tubman was not 
15
deterred and continued her work, rerouting the rail-
16
road to Canada instead. 
17
(7) Tubman made 13 trips back to Maryland, 
18
guiding 300 enslaved persons to freedom in the 
19
process. 
20
(8) During the arduous process of helping fugi-
21
tive enslaved persons escape through the Under-
22
ground Railroad System not a single person suc-
23
cumbed to death under her supervision.

(9) Tubman led an estimated 50 to 60 enslaved 
1
persons towards Canada. 
2
(10) During the year of 1858, Tubman aided 
3
John Brown, by recruiting supporters for the John 
4
Brown’s Harper’s Ferry Raid, a plan to attack 
5
slaveholders in Virginia and Maryland to help 
6
enslaved persons flee and become freedmen. 
7
(11) In the beginning of the Civil War, Tubman 
8
served as a cook and as a nurse in South Carolina 
9
and Florida. 
10
(12) Tubman also recruited African-American 
11
soldiers to join the regiment of African-American 
12
Soldiers. 
13
(13) Later in recognition for her abilities, Tub-
14
man served as an army scout and spy for Colonel 
15
James Montgomery. 
16
(14) Tubman distinguished herself as the first 
17
woman to lead an armed expedition in the Civil War, 
18
the Combahee River Raid, resulting in more than 
19
700 enslaved persons in South Carolina being freed. 
20
(15) After the Civil War, Tubman frequently 
21
sheltered and fed freed slaves at her home in South 
22
Street even though she had little money herself. She 
23
found a means to an end by selling produce from her

garden, taking in donations of food, loans from 
1
friends, and raising pigs in her backyard.

(16) In her retirement, Tubman became active 
3
in the women’s suffrage movement, where she at-
4
tended meetings and gave speeches in her home 
5
State of New York, as well as in Boston and Wash-
6
ington, DC. 
7
(17) Tubman was an avid advocate for African- 
8
American women and their rights. In 1896, she was 
9
invited as a speaker at the first meeting of the Na-
10
tional Association of Colored Women. 
11
(18) Although living in financial insecurity, 
12
Tubman gave a parcel of her land to the African 
13
Methodist Episcopal Church, which eventually be-
14
came a home for the aged and indigent colored peo-
15
ple. At the time few social services existed for the 
16
elderly. 
17
(19) Escaping slavery; risking everything to 
18
save her family; aiding enslaved persons escape; 
19
leading a military raid; championing the cause of 
20
women’s suffrage; Harriet Tubman is an individual 
21
