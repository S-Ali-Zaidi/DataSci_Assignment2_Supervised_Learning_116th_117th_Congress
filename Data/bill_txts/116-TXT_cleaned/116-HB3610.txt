1
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The United States, through existing author-
3
ization and supervision mechanisms, satisfies and is 
4
in conformity with its obligation under the Outer 
5
Space Treaty to authorize and supervise nongovern-
6
mental space activities to assure such activities are 
7
carried out in conformity with the international obli-
8
gations of the United States under the Outer Space 
9
Treaty. 
10
(2) The United States has a robust and innova-
11
tive private sector that is investing in, developing, 
12
and placing into outer space, spacecraft and pay-
13
loads. 
14
(3) Authorization and supervision mechanisms 
15
as of the date of enactment of this Act could be im-
16
proved to relieve administrative burdens on new and 
17
innovative nongovernmental space actors. 
18
(4) It serves the national interest to address 
19
misperceptions of legal uncertainty through the es-
20
tablishment of a general authorization and super-

vision certification authority for nongovernmental 
1
outer space activities. 
2
(5) The private exploration and use of outer 
3
space by nongovernmental entities will further the 
4
national security, foreign policy, and economic inter-
5
ests of the United States. 
6
(b) POLICY.—It is the policy of the United States 
7
that— 
8
(1) United States citizens and entities are free 
9
to explore and use space, including the utilization of 
10
outer space and resources contained therein, without 
11
conditions or limitations; 
12
(2) this freedom is only to be limited when nec-
13
essary to assure United States national security in-
14
terests are met and to authorize and supervise non-
15
governmental space activities to assure such activi-
16
ties are carried out in conformity with the inter-
17
national obligations of the United States under the 
18
Outer Space Treaty; 
19
(3) to the maximum extent practicable, the 
20
Federal Government shall interpret and fulfill its 
21
international obligations to minimize regulations and 
22
limitations on the freedom of United States non-
23
governmental entities to explore and use space;

(4) to the maximum extent practicable, the 
1
Federal Government shall take steps to protect the 
2
physical safety of space objects operated by the 
3
United States that do not involve limitations on the 
4
freedoms of nongovernmental entities of the United 
5
States; and 
6
(5) nongovernmental activities in outer space 
7
shall only be authorized and supervised in a trans-
8
parent, timely, and predictable manner, with mini-
9
mal costs and burdens placed on the entities author-
10
ized and supervised. 
11
(c) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this Act and the 
12
amendments made by this Act are— 
13
(1) to enhance the existing outer space author-
14
ization and supervision framework to provide greater 
15
transparency, greater efficiency, and less administra-
16
tive burden for nongovernmental entities of the 
17
United States seeking to conduct space activities; 
18
and 
19
(2) to ensure that the United States remains 
20
the world leader in commercial space activities.

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
20
(1) The commercial market for space-based re-
21
mote sensing technologies and information has expe-
22
rienced significant growth since the passage of the 
23
Land Remote Sensing Policy Act of 1992. 
24
03:00 Jul 12, 2019
H3610
30 
•HR 3610 IH
(2) It is in the interest of the United States to 
1
foster new and novel space-based remote sensing ap-
2
plications and services and to help facilitate their 
3
continued domestic growth. 
4
(3) Since the passage of the Land Remote 
5
Sensing Policy Act of 1992, the National Oceanic 
6
and Atmospheric Administration’s Office of Com-
7
mercial Remote Sensing has experienced a signifi-
8
cant increase in applications for private remote sens-
9
ing space system licenses as authorized under sec-
10
tion 60121 of title 51, United States Code. 
11
(4) Many of the applicants for commercial 
12
space-based remote sensing licenses have encoun-
13
tered significant delays and unnecessary obstacles in 
14
the application process. 
15
(5) The current licensing paradigm must be up-
16
dated as to not discourage the continued growth of 
17
the United States space-based remote sensing indus-
18
try. It must be updated in a way that satisfies the 
19
needs of commercial remote sensing market as well 
20
as the national security of the United States. 
21
(6) In order to protect United States leadership 
22
and commercial viability in remote sensing tech-
23
nologies, the Federal Government should not limit 
24
commercial entities from providing remote sensing 
25

•HR 3610 IH

1
reasonably expected to be made available in the next 
2
3 years in the international or domestic marketplace. 
3
(b) POLICY.—It is the policy of the United States 
4
that, to the maximum extent practicable, the Federal Gov-
5
ernment shall take steps to protect the national security 
6
interests of the United States that do not involve regu-
7
lating or limiting the freedoms of United States non-
8
governmental entities to explore and use space. Federal

Government agencies shall mitigate any threat to national

security posed by the exploration and use of outer space

12
extent practicable, changing Federal Government activi-
