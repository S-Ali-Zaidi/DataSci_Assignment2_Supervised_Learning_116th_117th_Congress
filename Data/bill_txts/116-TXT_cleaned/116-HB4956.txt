•HR 4956 IH
(1) Communities across the country are facing 
1
an affordable housing crisis. 
2
(2) Families who pay more than 30 percent of 
3
their income for housing are considered cost bur-
4
dened and may have difficulty affording necessities 
5
such as food, clothing, transportation, and medical 
6
care. 
7
(3) The Department of Housing and Urban De-
8
velopment estimates 12,000,000 renter and home-
9
owner households now pay more than 50 percent of 
10
their annual incomes for housing. 
11
(4) The prohibitive cost of housing slows eco-
12
nomic growth and means fewer jobs and lower 
13
wages. 
14
(5) Housing demand depends on local demo-
15
graphics, job markets, and place-based amenities. 
16
(6) Housing supply depends on local availability 
17
of land and the cost and complexity of housing de-
18
velopment. 
19
(7) Land-use restrictions are a significant fac-
20
tor in housing supply and prices. 
21
(8) There is evidence that exclusionary and re-
22
strictive zoning raises housing prices and restricts 
23
the supply of housing across the country. 
24
(9) Housing markets are local.

(10) Exclusionary and restrictive zoning policies 
1
that affect development are adopted by local govern-
2
ments. 
3
(11) The Federal Government has limited con-
4
trol over State and local land-use policy and zoning. 
5
(12) To understand and correct housing short-
6
ages, Federal, State, and local governments need to 
7
look at all options. 
8
(13) Housing is critical for health, economic 
9
stability, and academic success.
