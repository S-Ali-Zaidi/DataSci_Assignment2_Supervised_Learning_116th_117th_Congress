23
Congress finds as follows: 
24
15:46 Aug 29, 2020

•HR 7992 IH
(1) Nearly 18 percent of adults in the United 
1
States reported a mental, behavioral, or emotional 
2
disorder in 2015. 
3
(2) Children are also significantly impacted. Ac-
4
cording to the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
5
vention, 1 in 6 children ages 2 years through 8 years 
6
have a diagnosed mental, behavioral, or develop-
7
mental disorder, indicating that disorders begin in 
8
early childhood and affect lifelong health. 
9
(3) Moreover, 1 in 7 children and adolescents 
10
have at least one treatable mental health disorder. 
11
(4) There is a critical link between mental 
12
health and substance use disorders. According to the 
13
Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Ad-
14
ministration, 1 in 4 adults with severe mental illness 
15
had a substance use disorder in 2017. 
16
(5) Moreover, children who have had a major 
17
depressive episode are more than twice as likely to 
18
use illicit drugs. 
19
(6) In 2017, approximately 19.7 million people 
20
aged 12 years or older had a substance use disorder 
21
related to their use of alcohol or illicit drugs in the 
22
past year. 
23

•HR 7992 IH
(7) Despite this overwhelming need, access to 
1
behavioral health services remains among the most 
2
pressing health care challenges in our country. 
3
(8) An estimated 56 percent of Americans with 
4
a mental health disorder did not receive treatment in 
5
2017. 
6
(9) Similarly, half of children and adolescents 
7
did not receive treatment for their mental health dis-
8
order in 2016. 
9
(10) Further complicating access to care, as de-
10
mand for behavioral health services increases in 
11
communities across the United States, the number 
12
of psychiatrists available to treat them continues to 
13
decline. 
14
(11) The population of practicing psychiatrists 
15
declined by more than 10 percent between the period 
16
of 2003 through 2013, while the population of pri-
17
mary care physicians and neurologists grew during 
18
the same period. 
19
(12) Technology has evolved to connect individ-
20
uals to health care services in new ways, including 
21
via telehealth. 
22
(13) Moreover, studies show that video visits 
23
are an effective strategy to provide mental health

treatment to children and, in fact, may be preferable 
1
in some cases. 
2
(14) During the 115th Congress, Congress rec-
3
ognized the potential of telehealth to ensure that 
4
those in urgent need of substance use disorder treat-
5
ment receive the care they require. 
6
(15) As passed and signed into law, sections 
7
2001 and 1009 of the SUPPORT for Patients and 
8
Communities Act (Public Law 115–271) expands 
9
the use of telehealth services for the treatment of 
10
opioid use disorder and other substance use dis-
11
orders. 
12
(16) It is widely recognized that there is a close 
13
relationship between mental health and substance 
14
use disorders.

TITLE VII—KNOWING THE EFFI-
1
CIENCY AND EFFICACY OF 
2
PERMANENT 
TELEHEALTH 
3
OPTIONS 
4
SEC. 701. FINDINGS. 
5
Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) On January 21, 2020, the United States 
7
confirmed the Nation’s first case of the 2019 novel 
8
coronavirus (which presents as the disease COVID– 
9
19). 
10
(2) On January 31, 2020, the Secretary of 
11
Health and Human Services (in this title referred to 
12
as the ‘‘Secretary’’) declared a public health emer-
13
gency in response to COVID–19. 
14
(3) By March, the disease reached the pan-
15
demic level according to the World Health Organiza-
16
tion, and the President proclaimed the COVID–19 
17
outbreak in the United States to constitute a na-
18
tional emergency. 
19
(4) This emergency declaration authorizes the 
20
Secretary ‘‘to temporarily waive or modify certain 
21
requirements of the Medicare, Medicaid, and State 
22
Children’s Health Insurance programs and of the 
23
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 
24
Privacy Rule throughout the duration of the public

27 
•HR 7992 IH
health emergency declared in response to the 
1
COVID–19 outbreak’’. 
2
(5) Under this authority, the Secretary, and the 
3
Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Med-
4
icaid Services (in this title referred to as the ‘‘Ad-
5
ministrator’’) acting under the Secretary’s authority, 
6
issued numerous rules, regulations, and waivers ena-
7
bling the expansion of telehealth services during the 
8
public health emergency. 
9
(6) Telehealth services play a critical role in en-
10
hancing access to care for patients while simulta-
11
neously reducing the risk of exposure to the corona-
12
virus for both patients and providers. 
13
(7) The Administrator expanded access to tele-
14
health services under the public health emergency to 
15
all Medicare beneficiaries (including clinician-pro-
16
vided services to new and established patients). 
17
(8) On April 23, 2020, the Administrator re-
18
leased a telehealth toolkit to assist States in expand-
19
ing the use of telehealth through Medicaid and 
20
CHIP. 
21
(9) Expanded telehealth options are valuable 
22
for all Americans during this public health crisis, 
23
but especially for high-risk patients and rural Ameri-
24
cans who already have difficulty accessing care.
