A BILL 
To direct the Attorney General to convene a national working 
group to study proactive strategies and needed resources 
for the rescue of children from sexual exploitation and 
abuse, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘National Response to 
4
Exploitation and Sexual Abuse of Children in Unad-
5
dressed Emergencies Act’’ or the ‘‘Child RESCUE Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
7
Congress finds the following:

2 
•HR 7919 IH
(1) The growing international trade in child 
1
abuse imagery creates demand and incentive for the 
2
sexual assault of children throughout the United 
3
States. 
4
(2) United States law enforcement efforts to 
5
combat child sexual exploitation have the potential 
6
to help multiple distinct groups of victims, including 
7
children depicted in the imagery itself who are still 
8
being assaulted; children and adults whose past vic-
9
timization is being viewed and shared online; and 
10
children who are being sexually assaulted by adults 
11
who could be interdicted while accessing or sharing 
12
illegal imagery online. 
13
(3) In 2006, Congressional hearings of the 
14
Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House 
15
of Representatives, the Department of Justice, Fed-
16
eral Bureau of Investigation, and State law enforce-
17
ment leaders estimated that there are hundreds of 
18
thousands of adults in the United States engaging 
19
in child sexual abuse material crimes. 
20
(4) A growing body of research—including aca-
21
demic studies, analysis by the United States Sen-
22
tencing Commission, and findings by law enforce-
23
ment polygraphers—indicates that a majority of in-
24
dividuals possessing and sharing child sexual abuse 
25

•HR 7919 IH
material are ‘‘dual offenders’’, who both possess ille-
1
gal imagery and also commit contact offenses. 
2
(5) According to the National Association to 
3
Protect Children, identifying dual offenders through 
4
proactive police investigations is one of the most ef-
5
fective strategies for child sexual abuse prevention 
6
available. By using technology-assisted policing 
7
strategies, law enforcement can follow the trail of il-
8
legal imagery to the locations of offenders who have 
9
a sexual interest in children, enabling the rescue of 
10
current victims and interrupting future assaults. 
11
(6) Despite this historic opportunity to locate 
12
child sexual predators and rescue children, United 
13
States law enforcement is increasingly unable to con-
14
duct proactive investigations aimed at finding the 
15
most dangerous predators. According to the Na-
16
tional Center for Missing and Exploited Children, 
17
leads from electronic service providers and the public 
18
grew exponentially over the past decade, from 
19
500,000 in 2008 to 18.4 million in 2018. This influx 
20
of reports has overwhelmed law enforcement agen-
21
cies and task forces, forcing them to limit proactive 
22
investigations. 
23
(7) While continued, rapid response to leads 
24
from electronic service providers and the public is 
25

essential, increasing child rescues also requires 
1
United States law enforcement to increase and im-
2
prove its capacity to conduct victim-centric, proac-
3
tive investigations of suspects it believes have the 
4
highest likelihood of being contact offenders.
