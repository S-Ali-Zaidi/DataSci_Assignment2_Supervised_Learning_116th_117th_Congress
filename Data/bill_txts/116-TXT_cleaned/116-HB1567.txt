A BILL 
To authorize the Department of Defense to temporarily pro-
vide water uncontaminated with perfluorooctanoic acid 
(PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) for agri-
cultural purposes to areas affected by contamination

retary of the Air Force to acquire real property to extend 
the contiguous geographic footprint of any Air Force

SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS. 
6
In this Act: 
7
(1) 
PFAS.—The 
term 
‘‘PFAS’’ 
means 
8
perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances. 
9
(2) 
PFOA.—The 
term 
‘‘PFOA’’ 
means 
10
perfluorooctanoic acid. 
11
(3) 
PFOS.—The 
term 
‘‘PFOS’’ 
means 
12
perfluorooctane sulfonate.

SEC. 3. FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
14
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
15
(1) PFAS have been manufactured and used in 
16
a variety of industries around the world, including in 
17
the United States since the 1940s. 
18
(2) PFAS are found in many consumer prod-
19
ucts like cookware, food packaging, and stain 
20
repellants. 
21
(3) PFAS manufacturing and processing facili-
22
ties and airports and military installations that use 
23
firefighting foams are some of the main sources of 
24
22:46 Mar 20, 2019
H1567
3 
•HR 1567 IH
PFAS contamination in large concentrations that 
1
can lead to human exposure. 
2
(4) There is evidence that exposure to PFAS 
3
can lead to adverse health effects in humans. 
4
(5) PFAS are a group of man-made chemicals 
5
that includes PFOA and PFOS. 
6
(6) PFOA and PFOS have been the most ex-
7
tensively produced and studied of the PFAS chemi-
8
cals. 
9
(7) PFOA and PFOS are very persistent in the 
10
environment and in the human body, meaning they 
11
do not break down and can accumulate over time. 
12
(8) Studies indicate that PFOA and PFOS can 
13
cause reproductive and developmental, liver and kid-
14
ney, and immunological effects in laboratory ani-
15
mals. 
16
(9) The Environmental Protection Agency is be-
17
ginning the necessary steps— 
18
(A) to propose designating PFOA and 
19
PFOS as hazardous substances through one of 
20
the available statutory mechanisms, including 
21
section 102 of the Comprehensive Environ-
22
mental Response, Compensation, and Liability 
23
Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. 9602); and

(B) to set a maximum contaminant level 
1
under the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 
2
300f et seq.). 
3
(10) In the 1970s, the Air Force began pur-
4
chasing and using aqueous film-forming foam con-
5
taining PFOA and PFOS for extinguishing petro-
6
leum fires and during firefighting training activities. 
7
(11) The Air Force has used a proactive, com-
8
prehensive approach to identify installations where 
9
aqueous film-forming foam containing PFOA or 
10
PFOS has been used and there is a suspected re-
11
lease that may impact drinking water and expose 
12
humans to PFOA and PFOS. 
13
(12) The Air Force uses authorities granted 
14
under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, 
15
Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. 
16
9601 et seq.) and the Defense Environmental Res-
17
toration Program under chapter 160 of title 10, 
18
United States Code, to ensure that no one is drink-
19
ing water containing unacceptable levels of PFOA or 
20
PFOS due to Air Force activities. 
21
(13) The Air Force provides alternative sources 
22
of drinking water, including filters or connections to 
23
public utilities, to provide longer-term assurances 
24
22:46 Mar 20, 2019

•HR 1567 IH
that individuals are not drinking water containing 
1
unacceptable levels of PFOA or PFOS. 
2
(14) The Air Force asserts that authorities 
3
under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, 
4
Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. 
5
9601 et seq.) do not extend to the provision of clean 
6
water for livestock or agricultural purposes. 
7
(15) Livestock and agriculture are produced for 
8
human consumption in items such as milk and dairy 
9
and provide a direct pathway for human exposure to 
10
PFOA and PFOS. 
11
(16) Under section 634 of the Departments of 
12
Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and 
13
Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1998 (Public 
14
Law 105–119; 111 Stat. 2525), the Department of 
15
Defense was authorized to use available funds to 
16
compensate cranberry growers adjacent to the Mas-
17
sachusetts Military Reservation, Cape Code, Massa-
18
chusetts, for commercial loss of crops in 1997 due 
19
to the presence of ethylene dibromide in ground-
20
water, demonstrating previous recognition by Con-
21
gress of the need to provide compensation for dam-
22
ages associated with chemical releases at military in-
23
stallations.

(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-

5
until such time as the Federal agencies with over-
6
sight over agricultural products and food have estab-
7
lished regulatory standards; and 
8
(2) supports the designation by the Environ-
9
mental Protection Agency of PFAS as hazardous 
10
chemicals.
