•HR 1656 IH
(1) Our Nation is facing a critical physician 
1
shortage. 
2
(2) The predicted supply of pediatric medical 
3
specialists is not expected to meet demand over the 
4
next ten years, which may make it more difficult to 
5
provide children with complex or special health con-
6
ditions the care they need. 
7
(3) Research reflects that poverty can have a 
8
negative impact on the long-term care outcomes of 
9
children. Poverty conditions can contribute to poor 
10
nutrition, chronic illness, obesity and delayed devel-
11
opment. Ensuring pediatric physicians incorporate 
12
anti-poverty initiatives into their medical training 
13
can help improve the health of children living in pov-
14
erty. 
15
(4) The purpose of this Act is to provide addi-
16
tional assistance to the Children’s Hospital Graduate 
17
Medical Education (CHGME) program for the pur-
18
pose of incorporating initiatives to address pediatric 
19
health disparities.
