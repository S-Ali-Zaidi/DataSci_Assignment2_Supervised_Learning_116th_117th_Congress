to exchange criminal history records on an automated 
and nationwide basis;

Whereas SEARCH is a nonprofit organization created by and 
for the States, governed by a Membership Group com-
prised of one gubernatorial appointee from each of the

mation and identification technology, enables the justice 
and public safety decision-maker to administer justice in 
a manner that promotes individual rights and public safe-
ty’’; 
Whereas SEARCH provides training and technical assistance 
to help the criminal justice community combat high-tech-
nology crimes, gather valuable information in investiga-
tions, and link the Nation’s law enforcement agencies 
through policy and technical solutions; 
Whereas SEARCH helps agencies effectively implement infor-
mation sharing technology to make accurate, more in-
formed, immediate, and appropriately secured decisions 
about criminal justice and security issues, and to admin-
ister justice in an efficient and effective manner; 
Whereas SEARCH has pioneered the development of both 
technology and policy solutions for justice implementation 
of biometric technologies, thereby enabling electronic fin-
gerprints to become a rapid, reliable, and cost-effective 
identification authentication process and further sup-
porting information sharing and collaboration among and 
between agencies; 
Whereas SEARCH has made a profound contribution, work-
ing with the Department of Justice, to develop successive

Index (III), the National Instant Criminal Background 
Check System (NICS), commonly called the Brady check 
system, the National Fingerprint File (NFF), the Inte-
grated Automated Fingerprint Identification System 
(IAFIS), and key standards for information sharing and 
interoperability, such as the National Information Ex-
change Model (NIEM); 
Whereas SEARCH’s work with the Departments of Justice 
and Homeland Security helps the Nation’s justice and 
public safety communities plan, develop, implement, test, 
and manage interoperable communications solutions; and 
Whereas SEARCH has had many accomplishments over its 
50-year history to help practitioners in criminal justice, 
public safety, and first response use information to plan 
for, predict, prevent, and interdict criminal events, ter-
rorism, and disasters: Now, therefore, be it
