Whereas Impact Aid payments are dispersed directly to local 
educational agencies, which allocate the resources based 
on local context and needs to provide a quality education 
to the students they serve; 
Whereas nearly 880,000 children of our men and women in 
uniform, children residing on Indian lands, children in 
low-rent public housing, and children of civilians working 
or living on Federal land are ‘‘federally connected chil-
dren’’ who are served by local educational agencies that 
are eligible for Impact Aid Basic Support Payments in 
2020; 
Whereas there are 4,800,000 federally owned acres in local 
educational agencies that are eligible for Impact Aid Fed-
eral Property payments, with Federal land making up a 
quarter or more of the overall property in nearly one- 
third of these agencies; 
Whereas, in 2020, 1,159 local educational agencies enrolling 
over 10,000,000 students will receive $1,486,112,000; 
Whereas the Impact Aid statute (Public Law 81–874) was 
the vehicle used by Congress in 1965 to pass the Elemen-
tary and Secondary Education Act of 1965; 
Whereas Congress has continued to demonstrate its support 
for Impact Aid by reauthorizing the program 16 times 
during the period between 1950 and 2020; 
Whereas the House Impact Aid Coalition was established in 
1995 and the Senate Impact Aid Coalition was estab-
lished in 1996 to formalize and energize the broad, bipar-
tisan support for the Impact Aid program; and 
Whereas the Federal obligation upon which the Impact Aid 
program is based is today the same as it was 70 years 
ago: Now, therefore, be it
