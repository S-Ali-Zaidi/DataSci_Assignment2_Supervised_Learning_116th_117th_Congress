(D) exacerbates existing wealth and income

legal, and economic obligations that necessarily ex-
10
tend to how the citizens and residents of those gov-
11

(1) STUDY.—The Office, in consultation with 
1
the Commission, the Department of Agriculture, the 
2
Department of the Treasury, and such other Federal 
3
agencies as the Office considers appropriate, shall, 
4
not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment

of this Act, and biennially thereafter, conduct a 
6
study that examines the following: 
7
(A) The number of households for which 
8
cost is a barrier to the adoption of broadband 
9
service, the financial circumstances of such 
10
households, and whether such households are 
11
eligible for the broadband benefit under section 
12
1301. 
13
(B) The extent to which the cost of adop-
14
tion of broadband service is a financial burden 
15
to households that have adopted broadband 
16
service, the financial circumstances of such fi-
17
nancially burdened households, and whether 
18
such households are receiving the broadband 
19
benefit under section 1301. 
20
(C) The appropriate standard to determine 
21
whether adoption of broadband service is af-
22
fordable for households, given the financial cir-
23
cumstances of such households.

(D) The feasibility of providing additional

Federal subsidies, including expanding the eligi-
2
bility for or increasing the amount of the 
3
broadband benefit under section 1301, to 
4
households to cover the difference between the 
5
cost of adoption of broadband service (deter-
6
mined before applying such additional Federal 
7
subsidies) and the price at which adoption of 
8
broadband service would be affordable. 
9
(E) How a program to provide additional 
10
Federal subsidies as described in subparagraph 
11
(D) should be administered to most effectively 
12
facilitate adoption of broadband service at the 
13
lowest overall expense to the Federal Govern-
14
ment, including measures that would ensure 
15
that the availability of the subsidies does not 
16
result in providers raising the price of

broadband service for households receiving sub-
18
sidies.

21

any Lifeline-supported services provided as

part of a bundle of services to which a

Lifeline discount is applied, which Lifeline- 
12
supported services are part of such bundle

and whether or not each Lifeline-supported
