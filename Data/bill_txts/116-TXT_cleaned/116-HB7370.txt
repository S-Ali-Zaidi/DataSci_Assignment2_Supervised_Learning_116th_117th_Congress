SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
The Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Business bankruptcies have increased 
3
sharply in recent years and remain at high levels 
4
due to the impact of the COVID–19 pandemic. As 
5
the use of bankruptcy has expanded, job preserva-
6
tion and retirement security are placed at greater 
7
risk. 
8
(2) Laws enacted to improve recoveries for em-
9
ployees and retirees and limit their losses in bank-
10

•HR 7370 IH
ruptcy cases have not kept pace with the increasing 
1
and broader use of bankruptcy by businesses in all 
2
sectors of the economy. However, while protections 
3
for employees and retirees in bankruptcy cases have 
4
eroded, management compensation plans devised for 
5
those in charge of troubled businesses have become 
6
more prevalent and are escaping adequate scrutiny. 
7
(3) Changes in the law regarding these matters 
8
are urgently needed as bankruptcy is used to ad-
9
dress increasingly more complex and diverse condi-
10
tions affecting troubled businesses and industries.
