SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress makes the following findings:

(1) Steve Bannon was appointed to serve as 
3
chief strategist and senior counselor to the President

5
order, to the National Security Council on January 
6
28, 2017. 
7
(2) Under section 101 of the National Security 
8
Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3021), the National Security 
9
Council is responsible for the integration of domes-
10
tic, foreign, and military policies relating to the na-
11
tional security so as to enable the military services 
12
and the other departments and agencies of the Gov-
13
ernment to cooperate more effectively in matters in-
14
volving the national security. 
15
(3) To participate in highly sensitive meetings 
16
of the National Security Council, it is a prerequisite 
17
to have the highest available security clearances, in-
18
cluding access to compartmented information. 
19
(4) Question 23.9 on United States Government 
20
Standard Form 86, which all applicants seeking a 
21

22

23
signed to overthrow the U.S. Government by force?’’ 
24
(5) Question 29.4 asks: ‘‘have you ever been a 
25
member of an organization dedicated to the use of 
26

violence or force to overthrow the United States 
1
Government . . .’’ 
2
(6) Question 29.6 asks: ‘‘have you ever know-
3
ingly engaged in activities designed to overthrow the 
4
United States Government by force?’’ 
5
(7) Steve Bannon has made numerous inflam-
6
matory statements in support of overthrowing the 
7
United States Government. 
8
(8) In an interview dated August 22, 2016, 
9
Bannon referred to himself as a ‘‘Leninist’’, saying 
10
‘‘Lenin . . . wanted to destroy the state, and that’s 
11
my goal too. I want to bring everything crashing 
12
down, and destroy all of today’s establishment’’. 
13
(9) The Director of the National Background 
14
Investigations Bureau, Charles Phalen, Jr., testified 
15
before the Committee on Oversight and Government 
16
Reform of the House of Representatives on Feb-
17
ruary 2, 2017, about the process to investigate ap-
18
plicants for security clearances. 
19
(10) In response to questions from Ranking 
20
Member Elijah E. Cummings, Director Phalen 
21
agreed that calling oneself a Leninist would cause 
22
concerns during the background check process for a 
23
security clearance, saying ‘‘It would, and the investi-
24

•HR 2028 IH
gator should pursue that avenue of discussion with 
1
the subject as to what that means.’’. 
2
(11) In response to a specific question about 
3
someone whose goal was to ‘‘destroy the state,’’ Di-
4
rector Phalen responded ‘‘That would elicit a very 
5
strong line of questioning with that individual and 
6
with others to determine what he means by that so 
7
that we can give a full picture to the adjudicator.’’. 
8
(12) When asked what would happen if Bannon 
9
denied making these statements, Director Phalen re-
10
sponded that background check investigators would 
11
‘‘determine what the truth is’’.

SION OF SECURITY CLEARANCES FOR FED-
10
ERAL EMPLOYEES WHO THREATEN TO DE-

It is the sense of Congress that the head of a depart-
13
ment or agency of the Federal Government that issues a 
14
security clearance for an employee, including for an em-
15
ployee of the Executive Office of the President, should 
16
consider suspending the security clearance of the em-
17
ployee, if the employee threatens or has threatened to de-
18
stroy the State or to take hostile actions against the 
19
United States, to ensure such employee does not pose a 
20
threat to the United States.
