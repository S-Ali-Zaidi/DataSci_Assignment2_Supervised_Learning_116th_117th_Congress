Condemning all forms of anti-Asian sentiment as related 
to COVID–19. 
Whereas 23,000,000 Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders 
account for 7 percent of the Nation’s population in the 
United States; 
Whereas over 2,000,000 Asian Americans and Pacific Island-
ers are working on the frontlines of this COVID–19 pan-
demic in health care, law enforcement, first responders, 
transportation, supermarkets, and other service indus-
tries; 
Whereas the use of anti-Asian terminology and rhetoric re-
lated to COVID-19, such as the ‘‘Chinese Virus’’, 
‘‘Wuhan Virus’’, and ‘‘Kung-flu’’ have perpetuated anti- 
Asian stigma; 
Whereas since January 2020, there has been a dramatic in-
crease in reports of hate crimes and incidents against 
those of Asian descent; 
Whereas according to a recent study, there were over 400 
cases related to COVID-19 anti-Asian discrimination be-
tween February 9, 2020, and March 7, 2020;

sulted in Asian-American businesses being targeted for 
vandalism; 
Whereas there are approximately 2 million Asian American- 
owned businesses that generate over $700 billion in an-
nual revenue and employ nearly 4.5 million workers; 
Whereas the World Health Organization (WHO) and the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recog-
nize that naming COVID–19 by its geographic location 
or linking it to a specific ethnicity perpetuates stigma; 
Whereas in 2015, the WHO issued guidance calling on media 
outlets, scientists, and national authorities to avoid nam-
ing infectious diseases for locations to avoid stigmatizing 
groups of people; 
Whereas, on February 27, 2020, the Secretary of Health and 
Human Services stated ‘‘ethnicity is not what causes the 
novel coronavirus’’ and that it is inappropriate and inac-
curate to call COVID-19 the ‘‘Chinese virus’’; 
Whereas, on February 28, 2020, Dr. Mitch Wolfe, the Chief 
Medical Officer of the CDC said, ‘‘Stigma is the enemy 
of public health’’;

tor of the CDC, testified that use of the term ‘‘Chinese 
coronavirus’’ is wrong and inappropriate; and

discrimination of the outbreak’s victims: Now, therefore,
