A BILL 
To promote the domestic development and deployment of 
clean energy technologies required for the 21st century. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Clean Energy Victory 
4
Bond Act of 2019’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 4041 IH
(1) Potential exists for increasing clean and re-
1
newable energy production and energy efficiency in-
2
stallation in the United States. 
3
(2) Other nations, including China and Ger-
4
many, are ahead of the United States in manufac-
5
turing and deploying various clean energy tech-
6
nologies, even though the United States invented 
7
many of these technologies. 
8
(3) Climate change represents an existential 
9
threat to American safety, security, and the econ-
10
omy. Rapid and robust deployment of clean energy 
11
will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate 
12
the effects of climate change on American society. 
13
(4) Many segments of the American public 
14
want to take charge of efforts to combat the effects 
15
of climate change and practice responsible consumer 
16
behavior. 
17
(5) The Office of Energy Efficiency and Renew-
18
able Energy (EERE) of the Department of Energy 
19
(DOE) estimates that taxpayer investment of $12 
20
billion into EERE research and development port-
21
folio has already yielded an estimated net economic 
22
benefit to the United States of more than $230 bil-
23
lion, with an overall annual return on investment of 
24
more than 20 percent.

•HR 4041 IH
(6) Investments in renewable energy and energy 
1
efficiency projects in the United States create green 
2
jobs across the United States. New and innovative 
3
jobs could be created through expanded government 
4
support for clean energy and energy efficiency. 
5
(7) As Americans choose energy efficiency and 
6
clean energy and transportation, it reduces our de-
7
pendence on foreign oils and improves our energy se-
8
curity. 
9
(8) Bonds are a low-cost method for encour-
10
aging clean energy, not requiring direct budget allo-
11
cations or expenditures. The projects supported 
12
through Clean Energy Victory Bonds will create jobs 
13
and business revenues that will increase Federal tax 
14
revenues, while simultaneously reducing health and 
15
environmental costs incurred by the Federal Govern-
16
ment nationwide. 
17
(9) Bonds are voluntary measures that allow 
18
Americans to contribute financially at whatever 
19
means they have available to them. 
20
(10) In World War II, over 80 percent of Amer-
21
ican households purchased Victory Bonds to support 
22
the war effort, raising over $185 billion, or over $2 
23
trillion in today’s dollars.
