•HR 4266 IH
(1) many water resources in the United States 
1
are declining, particularly in urban and agricultural 
2
areas; 
3
(2) the decline of water resources is the result 
4
of— 
5
(A) an increase in population, water con-
6
sumption, agricultural production, and imper-
7
meable surfaces; and 
8
(B) the negative effects of urbanization, 
9
commercial and industrial activities, and in-
10
creasing and persistent droughts; and 
11
(3) an October 2008 study by the National Re-
12
search Council found that some of the benefits of in-
13
novative stormwater control infrastructure include— 
14
(A) increased water supplies; 
15
(B) the creation of jobs; 
16
(C) cost savings; and 
17
(D) a reduction of stormwater runoff, sur-
18
face water discharge, stormwater pollution, and 
19
stormwater flows to protect and restore natural 
20
hydrology, meeting local conditions to the max-
21
imum extent feasible.
