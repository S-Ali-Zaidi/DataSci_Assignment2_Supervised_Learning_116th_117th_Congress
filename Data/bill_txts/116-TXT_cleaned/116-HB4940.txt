1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Texas Ranger Divi-

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

The Congress finds the following:

•HR 4940 IH
(1) Established in 1823, the Texas Ranger Di-
1
vision of the Texas Department of Public Safety is 
2
the oldest serving statewide law enforcement agency 
3
in the Nation and will commemorate their 200th an-
4
niversary in 2023. 
5
(2) The Texas Rangers began as a multicul-
6
tural agency, and over two centuries have included 
7
Native Americans, Tejanos, Anglo Europeans, Afri-
8
can Americans, and Asian Americans serving in all 
9
ranks. Women have also served in both field and 
10
command ranks. 
11
(3) Through the centuries, the Texas Rangers 
12
have served first as a citizen militia protecting 
13
ranches, farms, and settlements against hostile 
14
raids; they became frontier law enforcement. After 
15
the Civil War they became frontier peace officers 
16
protecting against outlaws and banditry and pro-
17
viding law enforcement to new towns and settle-
18
ments on burgeoning railroad routes and cattle 
19
trails. With the turn of the 20th century they be-
20
came a State Police handling lawlessness in oil 
21
boomtowns, violations of Prohibition, and gangsters. 
22
(4) In 1935, the Texas Rangers were incor-
23
porated into one of the first Departments of Public 
24
Safety in the Nation. Today, they are internationally 
25

respected for conducting major criminal investiga-
1
tions, suppression of organized crime, border recon-
2
naissance, SWAT, bomb squad, special rapid re-
3
sponse, crisis negotiation, joint intelligence center 
4
management, and investigation of unsolved crimes. 
5
Pioneering initiatives such as the interdiction for the 
6
protection of children have resulted in invitations 
7
from law enforcement agencies throughout the Na-
8
tion and internationally from Australia to Great 
9
Britain to help initiate similar law enforcement ini-
10
tiatives. 
11
(5) The Texas Rangers have partnered with 
12
Federal agencies on numerous public safety and re-
13
lief initiatives such as in the aftermath of Hurricane 
14
Harvey and with the Federal Bureau of Investiga-
15
tions on numerous occasions, including the pursuit 
16
of Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow in 1934. 
17
(6) The Texas Rangers are also an icon of 
18
American popular culture. Songs, books, and novels 
19
have been written about them since the 1840s. They 
20
are America’s largest and oldest multimedia ‘‘fran-
21
chise’’ dating back to the earliest years of film, 
22
radio, and television. They have been featured in 
23
more than 225 movies and seven television series.

•HR 4940 IH
After the Alamo, the Texas Rangers are the best 
1
internationally known historical symbol of Texas. 
2
(7) The Texas Ranger Division Commemorative 
3
Coin will be the first commemorative coin to honor 
4
the Ranger Division of the Texas Department of 
5
Public Safety. 
6
(8) The United States should pay tribute to the 
7
Nation’s oldest statewide investigative law enforce-
8
ment agency, the Ranger Division of the Texas De-
9
partment of Public Safety, by minting and issuing 
10
commemorative coins, as provided in this Act. 
11
(9) A commemorative coin will bring national 
12
and international attention to the lasting legacy of 
13
this Nation’s statewide investigative law enforcement 
14
agency. 
15
(10) The proceeds from a surcharge on the sale 
16
of such commemorative coins will assist the financ-
17
ing of the State museum, charitable organizations, 
18
and educational scholarship.
