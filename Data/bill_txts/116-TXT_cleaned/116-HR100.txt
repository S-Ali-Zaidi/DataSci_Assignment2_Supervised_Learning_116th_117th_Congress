Whereas, in 1945, Easterseals expanded its children-focused 
mission by opening its programs and services to include 
adults to meet the emerging and increasing needs of re-
turning World War II veterans and other adults with dis-
abilities; 
Whereas, since its inception, Easterseals has strongly advo-
cated for essential services and supports for individuals 
with disabilities and diverse needs, including by authoring 
a 1931 ‘‘Bill of Rights’’ for children with disabilities that 
led to government-funded disability services and by in-
creasing public awareness and support through its suc-
cessful ‘‘seals’’ and other national campaigns; 
Whereas Easterseals has grown from its humble Elyria, Ohio, 
beginnings to become a network of leading nonprofit or-
ganizations in States across the country who deliver high- 
quality local services and supports to help children and 
adults with disabilities, veterans, older adults, caregivers, 
and their families achieve milestones, live independently, 
and fully participate in their communities; 
Whereas Easterseals is a strong partner with local and State 
governments, the Federal Government, corporations, 
foundations, and other sectors to provide or connect indi-
viduals and families to early childhood education and 
intervention services, employment assistance and place-
ment, transportation solutions, mental health services, 
respite, camping and recreation, and caregiving and 
aging supports; and 
Whereas, on April 22, 2019, Easterseals will celebrate 100 
years as it continues the mission and commitment to 
service envisioned by its founder, Edgar Allen, a parent, 
businessman, and Rotarian who concluded that ‘‘Your life
