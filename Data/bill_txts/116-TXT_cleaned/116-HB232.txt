The Congress finds that—

(1) the United States is in the midst of a hous-
8
ing crisis, as the homeownership rate has declined to

64.4 percent, which is lower than it was 20 years 
1
ago, while rental demand has increased and pushed 
2
vacancy rates down to 7.1 percent; 
3
(2) the median rental asking price is $1,003, up 
4
from $708 ten years ago; 
5
(3) in June 2018, United States housing rents 
6
hit an all-time high of $1,405 per month; of the 250 
7
largest U.S. cities 88 percent experienced increases 
8
in housing rents over the previous year; 
9
(4) families and individuals that pay more than 
10
30 percent of their income for housing are consid-
11
ered cost-burdened and have difficultly affording 
12
other necessities like food, clothing, transportation, 
13
and medical care; 
14
(5) almost half of all renters in the United 
15
States, approximately 19.9 million households, are 
16
cost-burdened; 
17
(6) 9.7 million extremely low-income renters 
18
spend more than 30 percent of their income on rent; 
19
of those renters, 8 million are considered severely 
20
cost-burdened and forced to spend more than half of 
21
their income on rent; 
22
(7) the current rental environment makes rental 
23
assistance under the Section 8 Housing Choice

Voucher Program of the Department of Housing

and Urban Development vital to finding affordable 
1
housing for many families; 
2
(8) the Section 8 Program helps approximately 
3
4.5 million low-income families, the elderly, and the 
4
disabled afford respectable housing in the private 
5
market; 
6
(9) the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Pro-
7
gram assists our Nation’s most economically vulner-
8
able families—the average annual income for all 
9
voucher-funded recipients is only $14,444; 
10
(10) many of the individuals and families as-
11
sisted by the Section 8 Program would be at risk of 
12
homelessness without the program; 
13
(11) the Section 8 program caps the rental cost 
14
for eligible families and individuals at 30 percent of 
15
their incomes, which frees up their limited resources 
16
to pay for life’s other necessities; 
17
(12) although families and individuals assisted 
18
under the program are free to choose any available 
19
housing in their community, that has not prevented 
20
landlords from discriminating against low-income 
21
tenants; 
22
(13) public housing authorities are experiencing 
23
historically low ‘‘success rates’’ as measured by the 
24
percentage of families who are receiving housing

vouchers that are actually able to use them in the 
1
private market; 
2
(14) given the strong connection between the 
3
classes currently protected under the Fair Housing 
4
Act, including race, gender, those with disabilities, 
5
familial status, and economic status, establishing a 
6
ban on income discrimination would further the 
7
goals of the Fair Housing Act and better protect 
8
these families and individuals; 
9
(15) for many years, landlords have relied on 
10
the Section 8 housing program to provide affordable 
11
housing to tenants in low-income areas, but as more 
12
urban areas have undergone rapid revitalization, 
13
property values have risen dramatically; 
14
(16) as a result of rising property values, there 
15
have been serious allegations that landlords are in-
16
tentionally allowing their federally subsidized units 
17
to deteriorate in an effort to drive voucher-users out 
18
and convert units to higher, market-rate apartments; 
19
(17) in addition, landlords are failing to meet 
20
the housing quality standards of the Department of 
21
Housing and Urban Development and improperly 
22
demanding rent in excess of 30 percent of voucher- 
23
holders’ incomes; and

1
nation against source of income, discourage inten-
2
tional acts to disqualify dwelling units from Federal 
3
housing programs, and encourage proper mainte-
4
nance of multifamily housing in order to revive the
