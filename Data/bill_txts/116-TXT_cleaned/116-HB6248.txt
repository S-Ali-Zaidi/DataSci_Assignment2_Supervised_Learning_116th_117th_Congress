A BILL 
To amend title 23, United States Code, to increase accessible 
transportation for individuals with disabilities. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Disability Access to 
4
Transportation Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) According to the Centers for Disease Con-
8
trol and Prevention, 1 in 4 U.S. adults has a dis-
9
ability.

•HR 6248 IH
(2) Section 2(b) of the Americans with Disabil-
1
ities Act (42 U.S.C. 12101) recognized that individ-
2
uals with disabilities face discrimination when using 
3
transportation services and sought to provide ‘‘a 
4
clear and comprehensive national mandate for the 
5
elimination of discrimination against individuals with 
6
disabilities’’. 
7
(3) 30 years after the enactment of the Ameri-
8
cans with Disabilities Act, individuals with disabil-
9
ities continue to face systemic discrimination and a 
10
lack of accessible transportation options. 
11
(4) Transportation is a core component of inde-
12
pendent living; without the ability to easily move 
13
from one location to another, especially to drop a 
14
child off at day care, arrive at work on time, or run 
15
basic errands, true community living is impossible. 
16
(5) Technology is changing the way the trans-
17
portation industry provides services. 
18
(6) As technology continues to change the way 
19
people move from one place to another, the transpor-
20
tation sector, including Federal agencies, local tran-
21
sit systems, and private entities must innovate and 
22
provide services in a way that empowers individuals 
23
with disabilities to travel independently in their com-
24
munities.
