(1) State Approving Agencies (SAAs) play a 
1
critical role administering GI Bill benefits to vet-
2
erans. 
3
(2) SAAs ensure veterans can use their GI Bill 
4
benefits at quality education and job-training pro-
5
grams like apprenticeships. 
6
(3) The SAAs primary purpose is to review, 
7
evaluate, and approve education and training pro-
8
grams to ensure veterans have the highest quality 
9
education. 
10
(4) The VALOR Act (Public Law 115–89), 
11
makes it easier for employers to offer apprentice-
12
ships to veterans. 
13
(5) In 2015, SAAs across the country con-
14
ducted almost 50,000 outreached-related actions to 
15
ensure veterans were informed of the benefits they 
16
are entitled to receive. 
17
(6) SAAs are now left to rely on outreach prod-
18
ucts created before 2015 and can no longer travel to 
19
job fairs and employers to ensure veterans, edu-
20
cational institutions, and employers know about the 
21
potential benefits and opportunities of the GI Bill.
