A BILL 
To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to revise 
the incentives for electric vehicles, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.

(a) SHORT TITLE.—This Act may be cited as the

‘‘Affordable American-made Automobile Act’’.

(b) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:

(1) The automobile industry is vital to the na-
1
tional economy and to national security. It employs 
2
millions of Americans and develops new technologies 
3
with widespread civilian and military application. 
4
(2) The global automobile industry is already in 
5
the midst of an historic transformation to electric 
6
vehicle technology. This transition has profound im-
7
plications for all Americans. 
8
(3) In critical measures of the global competi-
9
tion in the electric vehicle industry, the United 
10
States is behind China and is projected to fall fur-
11
ther behind. The United States is behind in total ve-
12
hicle sales, behind in the market share of new car 
13
sales, behind in investment, behind in battery manu-
14
facturing capacity, and behind in manufacturing ca-
15
pacity. The United States lags China to a great ex-
16
tent, but the United States is in third place in this 
17
competition, behind the European Union. 
18
(4) China sells half the electric vehicles sold in 
19
the world. In addition, China’s percent of new car 
20
market share of electric vehicles is twice that of the 
21
United States. In a few short years, the Chinese new 
22
market share of electric vehicles is expected to be 
23
triple the new market share in the United States.

(5) China is predicted to control about 75 per-
1
cent of the global battery capacity. 
2
(6) Global investment in electric vehicles is ex-
3
pected to reach $300 billion or even more; half of 
4
which is intended for China and only 10 percent for 
5
the United States. 
6
(7) There are 17 Chinese automobile manufac-
7
turers that have announced or undertaken electric 
8
vehicle investment. Even assuming some consolida-
9
tion of the Chinese industry, it will dwarf the num-
10
ber of manufacturers headquartered in the United 
11
States which is currently 4. 
12
(8) China supports its electric vehicle industry 
13
through a wide array of practices including state- 
14
owned enterprises, direct subsidies, special access to 
15
financing, government guarantees of financing, ex-
16
emptions from various regulatory requirements, pub-
17
lic purchasing, favoritism for Chinese firms, restric-
18
tions on market entry to foreign competition, and 
19
regulatory mandates. 
20
(9) Chinese domination of the electric vehicle 
21
industry will inevitably erode United States auto-
22
mobile manufacturing and the United States supply 
23
chain potentially resulting in the loss of hundreds of 
24
thousands of jobs. Employment in the innovation

and research side of the industry has already begun 
1
a migration outside the United States. 
2
(10) United States communities are also cur-
3
rently suffering from extreme events of flood, wind, 
4
and fire, as well as health-threatening air pollution, 
5
all of which are related to a warming planet. Electric 
6
vehicles will play a critical role in reducing the pollu-
7
tion that contributes to these tragedies. 
8
(11) Without changes to public policy, the auto-
9
motive industry in the United States will face ag-
10
gressive competition from foreign companies, chiefly 
11
located in China, and will fight a competitive battle 
12
on grossly unequal terms due to foreign government 
13
policies that unfairly favor overseas manufacturers. 
14
(12) Such an unfair fight is unwinnable by pri-
15
vate industry alone and is therefore a national pri-
16
ority for the Government of the United States to 
17
enter on behalf of every current and future Amer-
18
ican. 
19
(13) The United States faces a moment of crit-
20
ical choice. It either makes the investments nec-
21
essary to achieve global competitive leadership in 
22
this key industry, or it will face profound and dire 
23
consequences to its economy and its national secu-
24
rity.

(14) The United States needs to stimulate de-
1
mand for electric vehicles from middle class con-
2
sumers. Tax incentives for the development of con-
3
venient fast charging infrastructure are essential. 
4
Investment is needed to support increased electric 
5
vehicle and battery manufacturing capacity.
