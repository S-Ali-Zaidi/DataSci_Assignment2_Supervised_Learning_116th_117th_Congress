(b) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
1
(1) The decennial census was embedded in arti-
2
cle I of the Constitution of the United States by the 
3
founders of the United States for the purpose of ap-
4
portionment of seats among the States in the U.S. 
5
House of Representatives. 
6
(2) The founders believed that a census was es-
7
sential in measuring the progress of the country and 
8
helping to chart its future. 
9
(3) The 2020 decennial census will, for the dec-
10
ade to follow, shape the reapportionment of the 
11
House of Representatives and the drawing of thou-
12
sands of State and local political districts. 
13
(4) Over $800,000,000,000 in Federal assist-
14
ance to State and local communities every year is in-
15
formed by the results of the decennial census. 
16
(5) Congress seeks to make the 2020 decennial 
17
census the most complete, accurate, and fair decen-
18
nial census in the history of the United States. 
19
(6) The decennial census is the largest peace-
20
time mobilization undertaken by the Federal Gov-
21
ernment. 
22
(7) Any late, untested changes to the oper-
23
ational design of the decennial census will jeopardize
