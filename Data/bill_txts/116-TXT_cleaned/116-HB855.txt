A BILL 
To minimize the economic and social costs resulting from 
losses of life, property, well-being, business activity, and 
economic growth associated with extreme weather events 
by ensuring that the United States is more resilient 
to the impacts of extreme weather events in the short- 
and long-term, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Strengthening The Re-
2
siliency of Our Nation on the Ground Act’’ or the 
3
‘‘STRONG Act’’. 
4
SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. 
5
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following find-
6
ings: 
7
(1) Extreme weather has serious economic costs 
8
for Americans, American businesses, and State and 
9
local governments. Hurricanes, droughts, floods, tor-
10
nadoes, extreme heat, and extreme cold cause death, 
11
result in loss of property and well-being, especially 
12
among the most vulnerable populations, and nega-
13
tively impact business activity and economic growth. 
14
(2) In the past 10 years, there have been more 
15
than 109 weather-related disasters in the United 
16
States, generating $715.8 billion in total losses. 
17
(3) According to NOAA, in 2018 there were 11 
18
weather and climate disaster events that each caused 
19
$1 billion in damage across the United States. 
20
(4) These events and natural disaster trends, 
21
when combined with the volatility of weather, ongo-
22
ing demographic changes, and development in high 
23
risk areas, indicate that the negative impacts of ex-
24
treme weather events and natural disasters have the 
25
potential to increase over time. The fact that a sig-
26
03:27 Feb 07, 2019
H855
3 
•HR 855 IH
nificant number of people and assets continue to be 
1
located in areas prone to volatile and extreme weath-
2
er indicates that these events will continue to be ex-
3
pensive and deadly if the United States fails to en-
4
hance its resiliency to such events. Recent studies 
5
show that the intensity and frequency of some types 
6
of, but not all, extreme weather events will likely in-
7
crease in the future. 
8
(5) Economic savings can be achieved by con-
9
sidering the impacts of extreme weather over the 
10
short- and long-term in the planning process. For 
11
example, a 2017 review of the Federal Emergency 
12
Management Agency’s hazard mitigation programs, 
13
conducted by the National Institute of Building 
14
Sciences’ Multi-Hazard Mitigation Council, found 
15
that on average, society saves $6 for every $1 spent 
16
on mitigation projects, such as elevating floodprone 
17
buildings, improving stormwater management sys-
18
tems, following practices to reduce fire hazards, and 
19
building earthquake-resistant structures. 
20
(6) There are several efforts currently under-
21
way at the Federal, regional, tribal, State, and local 
22
levels that have helped lay the foundation for a fed-
23
erally coordinated effort to increase the Nation’s re-
24
siliency to extreme weather events, such as the Hur-

ricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force, the Presi-
1
dential Policy Directive on National Preparedness 
2
(referred to in this Act as ‘‘PPD–8’’), the National 
3
Preparedness System, the whole community ap-
4
proach led by the Department of Homeland Secu-
5
rity, and the Silver Jackets Program by the Army 
6
Corps of Engineers. Other recent reports on this 
7
subject include the National Academies of Sciences’ 
8
reports ‘‘Disaster Resilience: A National Imperative’’ 
9
and ‘‘Building Community Disaster Resilience 
10
through Public-Private Collaboration’’. 
11
(b) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act is to mini-
12
mize the economic and social costs and future losses of 
13
life, property, well-being, business activity, and economic 
14
growth by making the United States more resilient to the 
15
impacts of extreme weather events over the short- and 
16
long-term, thereby creating business and job growth op-
17
portunities by— 
18
(1) ensuring that the Federal Government is 
19
optimizing its use of existing resources and funding 
20
to support State and local officials, businesses, tribal 
21
nations, and the public to become more resilient, in-
22
cluding— 
23
(A) encouraging the consideration of, and 
24
ways to incorporate, extreme weather resilience 
25
03:27 Feb 07, 2019
H855
5 
•HR 855 IH
across Federal operations, programs, policies, 
1
and initiatives; 
2
(B) promoting improved coordination of 
3
existing and planned Federal extreme weather 
4
resilience and adaptation efforts that impact ex-
5
treme weather resilience and ensuring their co-
6
ordination with, and support of, State, local, re-
7
gional, and tribal efforts; 
8
(C) minimizing Federal policies that may 
9
unintentionally hinder or reduce resilience, such 
10
as damaging wetlands or other critical green in-
11
frastructure, or lead Federal agencies to oper-
12
ate at cross-purposes in achieving extreme 
13
weather resilience; and 
14
(D) building upon existing related efforts, 
15
such as the Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task 
16
Force, the PPD–8, the National Preparedness 
17
System, and the whole community approach; 
18
(2) communicating the latest understanding 
19
and likely short- and long-term human and economic 
20
impacts and risks of extreme weather to businesses 
21
and the public; 
22
(3) supporting decisionmaking that improves 
23
resilience by providing forecasts and projections,
