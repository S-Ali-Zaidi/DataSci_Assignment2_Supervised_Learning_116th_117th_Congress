SEC. 106. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE IMPOR-
8
TANCE OF TEACHERS IN INSPIRING CIVIC EN-
9
GAGEMENT. 
10
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
11
(1) Parents have a critical voice in ensuring 
12
their children receive an education that will help 
13
them to be engaged and productive members of 
14
American society, and members of the teaching pro-
15
fession are crucial to helping them achieve that goal. 
16
(2) The United States suffers from a lack of 
17
consistently effective civic education that imparts 
18
knowledge about government, democratic engage-
19
ment, and the Constitution. 
20
(3) Recent polling by the Annenberg Public 
21
Policy Center revealed that 22 percent of American 
22
adults are unable to name any of the three branches 
23
of government and 37 percent are unable to name

1
First Amendment to the Constitution. 
2
(4) Every State, the District of Columbia, the 
3
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and any other terri-
4
tory or possession of the United States reported a 
5
lack of qualified teachers in at least one academic 
6
subject during the 2017–2018 school year. 
7
(5) The Learning Policy Institute reported a 
8
teacher shortage of about 64,000 teachers during 
9
the 2015–2016 academic year and estimated that, 
10
beginning in 2020, 300,000 new teachers will be 
11
needed each year. 
12
(6) Teachers often do not receive full support 
13
for classroom activities or for advancing their con-
14
tributions to the education system through career 
15
development. 
16
(7) A survey by the Department of Education 
17
found that 94 percent of public school teachers in 
18
the United States paid for their own classroom sup-
19
plies and materials without reimbursement during 
20
the 2014–2015 school year, with the average teacher 
21
spending $479 out-of-pocket. 
22
(8) Eighteen percent of teachers work a second 
23
job during the school year, making teachers three

(9) Teachers in all subjects and at all grade lev-
3
els play a crucial role in educating youth about serv-
4
ice options and the ways youth can engage in their 
5
communities. 
6
(10) The advancement of civic education and 
7
the availability of well-trained and effective teachers 
8
are essential for the future health of civil society in 
9
the United States. 
10
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
11
gress that— 
12
(1) teachers of all subjects and at all grade lev-
13
els, 
including 
those 
in 
public, 
private, 
and 
14
homeschool settings, are essential in inspiring civic 
15
knowledge and engagement in their students; 
16
(2) public school teachers are dedicated public 
17
servants and should be honored and supported in 
18
their work to educate youth in the United States; 
19
(3) teachers are crucial in inspiring their stu-
20
dents to contribute to their Nation and communities 
21
through all forms of service; 
22
(4) the profession of teaching is a noble endeav-
23
or and one that is vital to the civic education of 
24
American youth;

(5) teachers across the country have sought to 
1
raise awareness of a crisis in resource support and 
2
adequate compensation for teachers, especially at 
3
public schools; 
4
(6) officials at all levels of government should 
5
seek to address these concerns by providing teachers 
6
with resource support, adequate compensation, and 
7
career development opportunities; and 
8
(7) more Americans will be called to the teach-
9
ing profession when government officials at all levels 
10
demonstrate value for the essential role of teachers 
11
in our society by providing teachers with resource 
12
support, adequate compensation, and career develop-

17
(1) The implementation of Federal laws and the 
18
competent administration of Federal programs re-
19
quire skilled and capable personnel. 
20
(2) Executive agencies depend on a blended 
21
workforce that includes Federal employees, employ-
22
ees of prime contractors and subcontractors per-
23
forming services to Executive agencies, and employ-
24
ees of State or local governments, nonprofit organi-
25

•HR 6415 IH
zations, or institutions of higher education per-
1
forming services to Executive agencies under the 
2
terms of grants and cooperative agreements (in this 
3
section referred to as ‘‘grantees’’), all of whom make 
4
essential contributions to achieving the missions of 
5
the Government in service to the American people. 
6
(3) Approximately 2,000,000 Federal employees 
7
help to execute the laws of the United States, sup-
8
plemented by an unknown number, estimated to ex-
9
ceed 5,000,000, of employees of prime contractors, 
10
subcontractors, and grantees providing services to 
11
Executive agencies. 
12
(4) Policymakers, Executive agencies, and ob-
13
servers have often focused on individual components 
14
of the blended workforce, such as employees, without 
15
considering all components or considering the entire 
16
blended workforce and how all 3 components can 
17
work most effectively together. 
18
(5) Executive agencies inhibit their own work-
19
force planning and risk making decisions that may 
20
reduce the overall efficiency and cost effectiveness of 
21
the blended workforce by focusing on only 1 compo-
22
nent in isolation. 
23
(6) Establishing artificial limits on headcounts 
24
or full-time equivalent positions for Federal employ-
25

150 
•HR 6415 IH
ees, administrators, and managerial employees of 
1
Executive agencies may discourage the employment 
2
of interns or entry-level employees to build a bal-
3
anced employment pipeline and may inadvertently 
4
encourage managers to shift work to contractors and 
5
grantees for the purpose of complying with such nu-
6
merical limits, even if those decisions are not justi-
7
fied by an approach to improve the efficiency or cost 
8
effectiveness of the Executive agency’s work. 
9
(7) The Government Accountability Office has 
10
identified strategic human capital management as a 
11
high-risk area for the Federal Government, adding 
12
that critical skills gaps ‘‘impede the government 
13
from cost-effectively serving the public and achieving 
14
results’’. 
15
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
16
gress that— 
17
(1) Executive agencies should manage the en-
18
tire Federal blended workforce, including employees, 
19
contractors, and grantees, using a comprehensive 
20
and holistic approach to advance their missions as 
21
effectively and cost efficiently as possible, within ap-
22

24
positions; and
