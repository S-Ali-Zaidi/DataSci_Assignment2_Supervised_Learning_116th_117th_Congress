To expand the research activities of the National Institutes 
of Health with respect to functional gastrointestinal and 
motility disorders, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

Congress finds the following:

•HR 3396 IH
(1) Functional gastrointestinal and motility dis-
1
orders (FGIMDs) are chronic conditions associated 
2
with increased sensitivity of the GI tract, abnormal 
3
motor functioning, and brain-gut dysfunction. 
4
(2) FGIMDs are characterized by chronic or re-
5
curring symptoms in the GI tract including pain or 
6
discomfort, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, 
7
incontinence, problems in the passage of food or 
8
feces, or a combination of these symptoms. 
9
(3) FGIMDs include both common and rare 
10
conditions, 
such 
as 
functional 
dysphagia, 
11
gastroesophageal reflux disease, dyspepsia, cyclic 
12
vomiting syndrome, gallbladder and bile duct dys-
13
function, gastroparesis, irritable bowel syndrome 
14
(IBS), Hirschsprung’s disease, chronic intestinal 
15
pseudo-obstruction, bowel incontinence, opioid in-
16
duced 
GI 
hyperalgesia, 
abdomino-phrenic 
17
dyssynergia (APD), and many others, which affect 
18
the esophagus, stomach, gallbladder, small and large 
19
intestine, and anorectal areas of the body. 
20
(4) The severity of FGIMDs ranges from mildly 
21
uncomfortable to debilitating and in some cases can 
22
be life-threatening. 
23
(5) Effective treatments for the multiple symp-
24
toms of FGIMDs are lacking, and while sufferers 
25

H3396

•HR 3396 IH
frequently use a variety of medications and therapies 
1
for symptoms, few patients report satisfaction with 
2
available treatments. 
3
(6) Physicians are not sufficiently educated on 
4
the proper diagnosis and up-to-date treatments for 
5
FGIMDs. This leads to excess health care costs due 
6
to unneeded diagnostic procedures and errors in 
7
treatments. 
8
(7) Frequently there is a need for a multidisci-
9
plinary care approach to patients with FGIMDs, in-
10
cluding access to nutritional and mental health sup-
11
port to improve pain management and facilitate pa-
12
tient and parent understanding of the brain-gut axis 
13
and overall patient functioning. 
14
(8) Patients with FGIMDs frequently suffer for 
15
years before receiving an accurate diagnosis, expos-
16
ing them to unnecessary and costly tests and proce-
17
dures including surgeries, as well as needless suf-
18
fering and expense. 
19
(9) The economic impact of FGIMDs is high. 
20
The annual cost in the United States for IBS alone 
21
is estimated to be between $1.7 billion and $10 bil-
22
lion in direct medical costs (excluding prescription 
23
and over-the-counter medications) and $20 billion in 
24
indirect medical costs.

•HR 3396 IH
(10) FGIMDs frequently take a toll on the 
1
workplace, as reflected in work absenteeism, lost 
2
productivity, and lost opportunities for the individual 
3
and society. 
4
(11) Gastrointestinal symptoms consistent with 
5
functional gastrointestinal disorders, such as IBS 
6
and functional dyspepsia, are recognized as a serious 
7
and disabling issue for military veterans, particularly 
8
those who have been deployed in war zones and ex-
9
perience posttraumatic stress disorder. 
10
(12) FGIMDs affect individuals of all ages in-
11
cluding children, and pediatric FGIMDs can be par-
12
ticularly serious, leading to a lifetime of painful 
13
symptoms and medical expenses associated with 
14
management of chronic illness or death, as well as 
15
missed school days and homebound instruction. 
16
(13) There is inadequate public education and 
17
misunderstanding of FGIMDs leading to stigma 
18
placed upon individuals so afflicted. 
19
(14) The National Institutes of Health’s Na-
20
tional Commission on Digestive Diseases identified 
21
comprehensive research goals related to FGIMDs in 
22
its April 2009 report to Congress and the American 
23

It is the sense of Congress that, considering the cur-

rent lack of effective treatment options for the global 
13
symptoms of functional gastrointestinal and motility dis-
14
orders (in this section referred to as ‘‘FGIMDs’’) and the 
15
inherent challenges of developing and bringing such treat-
16
ments to market, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs 
17
should continue and accelerate important efforts to im-
18
prove the development and oversight of treatment options 
19
for FGIMDs by— 
20
(1) enhancing the commitment to emerging ef-
21
forts like the Patient Reported Outcomes Consor-
22
tium to expedite medical device and drug develop-
23
ment, the study of appropriate balances between risk 
24
and patient benefit, and identification of proper

endpoints for conditions without clear, biological in-
1
dicators; 
2
(2) enhancing the commitment to broad efforts 
3
like the Critical Path Initiative focused on ensuring 
4
that scientific breakthroughs are quickly translated 
5
into safe and beneficial treatment options for both 
6
pediatric and adult patients; and 
7
(3) continuing collaboration with patient and 
8
provider organizations that treat FGIMDs so that 
9
the patient perspective is considered when deter-
10
mining the need for innovative treatments.
