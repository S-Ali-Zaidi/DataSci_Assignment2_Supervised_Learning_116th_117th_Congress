as a foundation of our economic competitiveness and

national security. It is imperative that Congress 
1
maintain and revitalize the roads, bridges, ports, 
2
railways, airports, transit systems, water systems, 
3
and information networks of this country, enabling 
4
all industries to achieve the growth and productivity 
5
that make the United States strong and prosperous. 
6
(2) Investing in transportation, water, and in-
7
formation infrastructure creates long-term capital 
8
assets for the Nation that will improve economic 
9
productivity. 
10
(3) Investment in infrastructure creates jobs 
11
and spurs economic activity to put people back to 
12
work and grow the economy. 
13
(4) The cost to maintain and improve our Na-
14
tion’s highways, bridges, and other critical transpor-
15
tation infrastructure significantly exceeds what is 
16
currently being provided by all levels of government. 
17
(5) Investment in our Nation’s infrastructure 
18
must be multi-faceted, both by ensuring that there 
19
is a sustainable long-term funding source for infra-
20
structure and through using innovative financing 
21
mechanisms. 
22
(6) Areas that are underserved by modern 
23
broadband connections are disadvantaged, and en-
24
suring that those areas are connected will enable the 
25

•HR 1508 IH
Nation to benefit from the fuller participation of 
1
previously underserved citizens in the national econ-
2
omy. 
3
(7) Investment in infrastructure is needed 
4
throughout the Nation, and it is essential that infra-
5
structure legislation, including but not limited to 
6
this legislation, benefit urban and rural areas, and 
7
large and small States. 
8
(b) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act is to provide 
9
tools to finance additional transportation, water, and in-
10
formation infrastructure capital investments, through an 
11
approach that provides assistance for financing of infra-
12
structure to all States, rural and urban, and large and 
13
small.
