A BILL 
To amend the Public Health Service Act to establish a pro-
gram of research regarding the risks posed by the pres-
ence of dioxin, synthetic fibers, chemical fragrances, and 
other components of feminine hygiene products. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Robin Danielson Femi-

The Congress finds as follows:

•HR 3865 IH
(1) Feminine hygiene products are widely used 
1
by women in the United States today, but there is 
2
not enough research on the components of these 
3
products. 
4
(2) Women may be exposed to substances in 
5
tampons and other menstrual products for as long 
6
as 60 years over the course of their reproductive 
7
lives. The average woman may use as many as 
8
16,800 tampons in her lifetime. A woman on meno-
9
pausal hormone therapy may use as many as 24,360 
10
tampons in her lifetime. 
11
(3) Trace amounts of dioxins can be found in 
12
tampons or other feminine hygiene products. The 
13
Environmental Protection Agency and the Inter-
14
national Agency for Research on Cancer, an arm of 
15
the World Health Organization, have concluded that 
16
dioxins are a probable human carcinogen (cancer- 
17
causing agent). 
18
(4) The Food and Drug Administration (re-
19
ferred to in this section as the ‘‘FDA’’) has histori-
20
cally relied on data provided by manufacturers of 
21
feminine hygiene products in determining product 
22
safety. 
23
(5) Although the FDA currently requires tam-
24
pon manufacturers to routinely monitor dioxin levels

in raw materials and finished tampons, this informa-
1
tion is not readily available to the public. The FDA 
2
should consider whether to expand regulation to in-
3
clude other types of feminine hygiene products and 
4
a broader list of contaminants.
