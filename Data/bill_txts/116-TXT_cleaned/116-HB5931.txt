(1) affordable homeownership opportunities are 
1
being stymied due to the lack of financing available 
2
for home purchases under $70,000; 
3
(2) according to the Urban Institute, small-dol-
4
lar mortgage loan applications in 2017 were denied 
5
by lenders at double the rate of denial for large 
6
mortgage loans, and these denial rates were not re-
7
lated to applicants’ creditworthiness; 
8
(3) according to data compiled by Attom Data 
9
solutions, small-dollar mortgage originations have 
10
decreased 38 percent since 2009, while there has 
11
been a 65-percent increase in origination of mort-
12
gages for more than $150,000; 
13
(4) although the FHA’s mission is to serve 
14
creditworthy borrowers who are underserved, accord-
15
ing to the Urban Institute the FHA serves 24 per-
16
cent of the overall market, but only 19 percent of 
17
the small-dollar mortgage market; and 
18
(5) the FHA should play a greater role in sup-
19
porting affordable homeownership opportunities by 
20
reducing barriers to small-dollar lending, as is con-
21
sistent with the Department of Housing and Urban 
22
Development’s mission, including meeting the hous-
23
ing needs of borrowers the program is designed to

(b) REVIEW.—The Secretary of Housing and Urban 
3
Development shall conduct a review of its FHA single- 
4
family mortgage insurance policies, practices, and prod-
5
ucts to identify any barriers or impediments to supporting, 
6
facilitating, and making available mortgage insurance for 
7
mortgages having an original principal obligation of 
8
$70,000 or less. Not later than the expiration of the 12- 
9
month period beginning on the date of the enactment of 
10
this Act, the Secretary shall submit a report to the Con-
11
gress describing the findings of such review and the ac-
12
tions that the Secretary will take to remove such barriers 
13
and impediments to providing mortgage insurance for 
14
such mortgages without adversely affecting the solvency 
15
of the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund.
