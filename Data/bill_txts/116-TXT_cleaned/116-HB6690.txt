identified the virus as a novel coronavirus which 
5
would later be understood to cause a respiratory ill-
6
ness in humans, known as COVID-19.

(3) The spread of the coronavirus and the geo-
8
graphic location of the original outbreak caused re-
9
verberations in medical supply chains that reached 
10

United States dependency on China for critical med-
13

15
vices to the United States.

nounce strategic control over medical products and 
6
ban exports to the United States. Then the United 
7
States will be caught in the ocean of the new

coronaviruses.’’.
