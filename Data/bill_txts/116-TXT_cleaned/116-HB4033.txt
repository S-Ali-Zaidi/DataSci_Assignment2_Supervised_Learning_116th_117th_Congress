Congress finds that— 
4
(1)(A) everyone has the right to clean and safe 
5
drinking water and appropriate sanitation services; 
6
and 
7
(B) the Federal Government has the responsi-
8
bility to ensure that the rights described in subpara-

estimated 
that 
2
$1,000,000,000,000 is necessary to maintain and ex-
3
pand service during the 25-year period beginning on 
4
the date of enactment of this Act; 
5
(3) deterioration and aging of the water infra-
6
structure of the United States has resulted in mil-
7
lions of people of the United States being exposed to 
8
unsafe drinking water, including lead contamination; 
9
(4) exposure to lead can cause serious health 
10
problems, especially to young children and pregnant 
11
women, including damage to the brain and nervous 
12
system, kidney problems, and high blood pressure; 
13
(5) the Government Accountability Office esti-
14
mates that 43 percent of school districts, serving 
15
35,000,000 students, tested for lead in school drink-
16
ing water in 2016 or 2017; 
17
(6) of the schools that tested for lead as de-
18
scribed in paragraph (5), an estimated 37 percent 
19
found levels of lead above the threshold of the school 
20
district for taking remedial action; 
21
(7) according to the American Water Works As-
22
sociation, approximately 30 percent of surveyed com-
23
munity water systems in the United States reported 
24
having some lead-containing service lines;

(8) the continuing emergency of drinking water 
1
contamination in communities like Flint, Michigan, 
2
demonstrates the severity of this crisis across the 
3
United States; 
4
(9) many rural areas across the United States 
5
also face severe drinking water challenges, as the 
6
community water systems serving small populations 
7
in the United States often lack sufficient financial 
8
and technical resources; 
9
(10) boil water advisories are a daily occurrence 
10
in the United States, and those advisories dispropor-
11
tionately impact small drinking water systems, with 
12
some advisories in rural areas lasting for years; 
13
(11) it is estimated that 13,000,000 households 
14
in the United States rely on well water, with no Fed-
15
eral regulation or testing of contaminants; 
16
(12) past appropriations for the Environmental 
17
Protection Agency grant programs that address 
18
school drinking water and drinking water contami-
19
nation in high-risk communities are not sufficient to 
20
address the tremendous need throughout the United 
21
States; 
22

23
while 
fulfilling 
critical 
needs 
in 
communities

throughout the United States;

(14) it is estimated that nearly 17,200,000 
1
workers, about 12 percent of the United States 
2
workforce, were employed in infrastructure jobs in 
3
2018; 
4
(15) infrastructure occupations often provide 
5
more competitive and equitable wages in comparison 
6
to all jobs nationally, consistently paying up to 30 
7
percent more to workers at lower ends of the income 
8
scale; 
9
(16) the sixth national assessment by the Envi-
10
ronmental Protection Agency of drinking water in-
11
frastructure needs shows a total 20-year capital im-
12
provement need of $472,600,000,000 for public 
13
water systems; 
14
(17) emergency supplemental appropriations for 
15
the Environmental Protection Agency, provided in 
16
addition to other appropriations and not subject to 
17
sequestration, will improve drinking water in schools 
18
and high-risk communities and create jobs through-
19
out the United States without reducing funding for 
20
other domestic priorities; 
21
(18) appropriating $50,000,000,000 in fiscal 
22
year 2020 for the Environmental Protection Agency,

and allowing the funds to remain available for 5

(19) a $50,000,000,000 investment in drinking 
4
water infrastructure could create 1,250,000 jobs; 
5
(20) an emergency supplemental appropriation 
6
of $50,000,000,000 for the Environmental Protec-
7
tion Agency, to be made available in fiscal year 
8
2020, and to remain available for 5 years, will allow 
9
States to begin immediately to distribute funds to el-
10
igible schools and high-risk communities to develop 
11
and implement plans to improve drinking water in-
12
frastructure, through accelerated and expanded re-
13
placement of lead-based service lines and other crit-

16
(21) emergency supplemental appropriations for 
17
remediating the drinking water infrastructure emer-

gency in the United States can be leveraged— 
19
(A) to create high-quality union jobs; and

TITLE II—WATER ACCESSIBILITY 
17
AND AFFORDABILITY 
18
SEC. 201. FINDINGS. 
19
Congress finds the following: 
20
(1) Obtaining reliable and affordable water 
21
service is becoming increasingly difficult due to 
22
aging infrastructure, climate change, and population 
23
changes. 
24
22:51 Aug 26, 2019

•HR 4033 IH
(2) Household water rates have increased by 
1
approximately 41 percent since 2010. Over the last 
2
several decades, the cost for drinking water and 
3
wastewater services has risen much more rapidly 
4
than other household expenses. 
5
(3) According to the Environmental Protection 
6
Agency, low-income households are particularly im-
7
pacted by water affordability challenges when drink-
8
ing water, wastewater, and stormwater rates are 
9
raised. 
10
(4) Across the United States, water and waste-
11
water bills have been increasing at more than twice 
12
the rate of inflation for nearly 2 decades. Addition-
13
ally, incomes have barely kept up with inflation over 
14
the same period. It is anticipated that rates for 
15
water and wastewater services will continue to in-
16
crease to meet the need for billions of dollars of 
17
overdue investment in our Nation’s water and waste-
18
water systems. 
19
(5) The Environmental Protection Agency re-
20
ports that approximately 15 percent of residential 
21
water customers nationally are low-income house-
22
holds that are constantly at risk of being unable to 
23
pay their water bills. 
24
22:51 Aug 26, 2019
H4033
11 
•HR 4033 IH
(6) Low-income households are 3 times more 
1
likely than other households to have their utility 
2
service disconnected for unpaid or overdue bills. 
3
(7) An estimated 15,000,000 people in the 
4
United States experienced a water shutoff in 2016 
5
with the highest shutoff rates in lower-income cities 
6
with higher rates of poverty and unemployment. 
7
(8) In 2017, total appropriations to the Envi-
8
ronmental Protection Agency for water infrastruc-
9
ture were 35 percent lower than the corresponding 
10
2001 appropriations (adjusted for inflation) despite 
11
massive capital investments being needed for drink-
12
ing water and wastewater systems. 
13
(9) Water accessibility is a fundamental ele-
14
ment of public health, safety, welfare, and security.
