SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Rights for Transpor-
2
tation Security Officers Act of 2019’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
4
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) On September 11, 2001, nineteen terrorists, 
6
who underwent airport security screening prior to 
7
boarding domestic flights, were able to commandeer 
8
four airplanes and use those airplanes to perpetrate 
9
the most deadly terrorist attack ever to be executed 
10
on United States soil. 
11
(2) In the aftermath of those attacks, Congress 
12
passed the Aviation and Transportation Security Act 
13
(ATSA), enacted by President George W. Bush on 
14
November 19, 2001 (Public Law 107–71), to en-
15
hance the level of security screening throughout our 
16
aviation system and transfer responsibility for such 
17
screening from the private sector to a new Federal 
18
agency, the Transportation Security Administration 
19
(TSA). 
20
(3) TSA was established in recognition of the 
21
need to raise the level of screener performance and 
22
that achieving such performance is directly linked to 
23
employment and training standards, pay and bene-
24
fits, and the creation of an experienced, committed 
25
Federal screening workforce. 
26

•HR 1140 IH
(4) The Aviation and Transportation Security 
1
Act included a statutory footnote allowing the TSA 
2
Administrator to ‘‘employ, appoint, discipline, termi-
3
nate, and fix the compensation’’, including the 
4
‘‘terms, and conditions of employment of Federal 
5
Service for such a number of individuals as the [Ad-
6
ministrator] determines to be necessary to carry out 
7
the screening functions of the Under Secretary 
8
under section 44901 of title 49, United States 
9
Code’’. 
10
(5) TSA has cited the ATSA footnote as the 
11
basis for developing a personnel system for the TSO 
12
workforce, while all other Transportation Security 
13
Administration employees, including managers, are 
14
under the Federal personnel system provided under 
15
title 5, United States Code, as incorporated in title 
16
49 of such Code. 
17
(6) In November 2006, the International Labor 
18
Organization ruled that the Bush administration vio-
19
lated international labor law when it prohibited 
20
Transportation Security Officers from engaging in 
21
collective bargaining. 
22
(7) After the Federal Labor Relations Board 
23
approved a petition for the election of an exclusive 
24
representative, on February 4, 2011, then-TSA Ad-
25
23:41 Feb 21, 2019
H1140

•HR 1140 IH
ministrator John Pistole issued a binding determina-
1
tion stating in part ‘‘it is critical that every TSA 
2
employee feels that he or she has a voice and feels 
3
safe raising issues and concerns of all kinds. This is 
4
important not just for morale; engagement of every 
5
employee is critically important for security’’. 
6
(8) Subsequently, in 2014, then-Administrator 
7
Pistole issued a second determination, which was su-
8
perseded by a 2016 determination, which changed 
9
the previous guidelines for collective bargaining and 
10
limited the subjects that can be bargained as well as 
11
issues in dispute that may be raised to an inde-
12
pendent, third-party neutral decisionmaker. 
13
(9) The 2011, 2014, and 2016 determinations 
14
cited the ATSA footnote as authority to create a 
15
personnel system that denies the Transportation Se-
16
curity Officer workforce the same rights and protec-
17
tions under title 5, United States Code, as other 
18
Federal workers, including the right to present 
19
grievances to a neutral third party, fair pay under 
20
the General Services wage system, including access 
21
to overtime pay and earned leave, and Fair Labor 
22
Standards Act protections. 
23
(10) The Transportation Security Officer work-
24
force is an integral component of the security frame-
25

•HR 1140 IH
work in place since the terrorist attacks on Sep-
1
tember 11, 2001, and responsible for screening more 
2
than 738 million passengers annually. 
3
(11) In the course of their work, Transpor-
4
tation Security Officers not only identify aviation se-
5
curity threats but also identify kidnapping and traf-
6
ficking victims and prevent firearms from being 
7
brought on planes in carry-on bags. In 2018 alone, 
8
4,239 firearms were discovered by Transportation 
9
Security Officers at aviation security checkpoints. 
10
(12) Every day, Transportation Security Offi-
11
cers put their safety on the line to protect the flying 
12
public and on November 1, 2013, a Transportation 
13
Security Officer, Gerardo Hernandez, gave his life to 
14
protect the flying public when he was killed by a 
15
gunman who attacked the Los Angeles International 
16
Airport. 
17
(13) Transportation Security Officers are vital 
18
to aviation security and have kept the American 
19
aviation system secure, even during lapses in appro-
20
priations, when they were not paid. For 16 days in 
21
2013, three days in 2018, and, most recently, 35 
22
days in at the end of 2018 through early 2019, the 
23
TSA workforce worked without pay alongside air-
24
plane safety specialists, air traffic controllers, and 
25
23:41 Feb 21, 2019
H1140

•HR 1140 IH
other Federal workers responsible for the aviation 
1
security and safety framework that has protected 
2
United States air travel since 2001. 
3
(14) The adverse impact of two missed pay-
4
checks during the shutdown that took place between 
5
December 22, 2018, and January 25, 2019, was felt 
6
disproportionately by the Transportation Security 
7
Officer workforce, with many Officers receiving 
8
starting salaries of as low as $32,000. 
9
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
10
gress that the Transportation Security Administration’s 
11
personnel system for the Transportation Security Officer 
12
workforce provides insufficient benefits and workplace 
13
protections to these frontline personnel who secure the 
14
United States aviation system, and that such personnel 
15
should be provided protections and benefits under title 5, 
16
United States Code.
