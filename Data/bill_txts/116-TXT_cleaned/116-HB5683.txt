SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
The Congress finds as follows: 
2
(1) Data from the Centers for Disease Control 
3
and Prevention shows that in 2015–2016 close to 40 
4
percent of adults in the United States were obese 
5
and 71.6 percent of Americans were overweight or 
6
obese. Approximately 7.7 percent of adults were se-
7
verely obese. 
8
(2) Data from two National Health and Nutri-
9
tion Examination Surveys shows that the prevalence 
10
of obesity among adults increased from 15.0 percent 
11
in 1976–1980 to 39.8 percent in 2015–2016. 
12
(3) In 2015–2016, the prevalence of obesity 
13
among youth aged 2–19 was 18.5 percent and af-
14
fected approximately 13,700,000 children and ado-
15
lescents. 
16
(4) The percentage of children and adolescents 
17
who are obese has increased since 1971–1974, when 
18
the percentage was 5 percent. 
19
(5) In 2018, only 53.3 percent of United States 
20
adults aged 18–64 met the 2008 Federal guidelines 
21
for aerobic activity. The 2008 Federal Physical Ac-
22
tivity Guidelines for American Adults recommends 
23
150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity aerobic 
24
physical activity or 75 minutes a week of vigorous- 
25
intensity aerobic physical activity.

(6) The rising rates of obesity portend greater 
1
disease and health conditions, including hyper-
2
tension, high total cholesterol, Type 2 diabetes, coro-
3
nary heart disease, stroke, gallbladder disease, 
4
osteoporosis, sleep apnea, respiratory problems, and 
5
some cancers, such as endometrial, breast, and colon 
6
cancer. 
7
(7) Many underlying factors have been linked to 
8
the increase in obesity, such as increasing portion 
9
sizes, eating out more often, increased consumption 
10
of sugar-sweetened drinks, increasing television, 
11
computer, and electronic gaming time, changing 
12
labor markets, and fear of crime, which prevents 
13
outdoor exercise. 
14
(8) Chronic diseases account for 1,700,000, or 
15
70 percent, of all deaths in the United States each 
16
year. Although chronic diseases are among the most 
17
common and costly health problems, they are also 
18
among the most preventable. Adopting a healthy 
19
lifestyle, such as eating nutritious foods and engag-
20
ing in physical activity, can prevent or control the 
21
devastating effects of these diseases. 
22
(9) In 2008, overall medical costs related to 
23
obesity for United States adults were estimated to 
24
be as high as $147,000,000,000. People who were

obese had medical costs that were on average $1,429

higher than the cost for people of normal body

weight.
