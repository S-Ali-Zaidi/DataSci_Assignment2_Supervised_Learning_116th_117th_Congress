1
(a) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds as follows: 
2
(1) The United States has the objective of sta-
3
bilizing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmos-
4
phere at a level that would prevent ‘‘dangerous an-
5
thropogenic interference’’ with the climate system as 
6
demonstrated by becoming a party to the 1992 
7
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
8
Change, pledging to China to reduce greenhouse gas 
9
emissions to 28 percent of their 2005 levels by 2025, 
10
and regulating greenhouse gas emissions from sta-
11
tionary sources, mobile sources, and electrical power 
12
suppliers. 
13
(2) To achieve this objective, the increase in 
14
global mean surface temperature should not exceed 
15
2°C (3.6°F) above preindustrial temperature by 
16
2100 consistent with the Paris Agreement that en-
17
tered into force in 2016. 
18
(3) The risks associated with a temperature in-
19
crease above 2°C (3.6°F) are grave, including the 
20

disintegration of the Greenland ice sheet, which, if 
1
it were to melt completely, would raise global aver-
2
age sea level by approximately 23 feet, devastating 
3
many of the world’s coastal areas and population 
4
centers. 
5
(4) A 2018 report by the Intergovernmental 
6
Panel on Climate Change demonstrated that limiting 
7
the temperature increase to 1.5°C will result in still 
8
harmful, but significantly less severe outcomes than 
9
a 2°C increase. 
10
(5) The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
11
Change projects that temperatures will rise 1.5°C 
12
between 2030 and 2052. In order to limit the tem-
13
perature increase to 1.5°C, global net anthropogenic 
14
carbon dioxide emissions must reach net zero by 
15
2050. 
16
(6) The 2018 National Climate Assessment, au-
17
thored by more than 300 experts and released by the 
18
United States Global Change Research Program, 
19
makes clear that the present unprecedented rises in 
20
global temperature are primarily due to human ac-
21
tivities. The changing climate will devastate all sec-
22
tors of society and disproportionately harm the most 
23
vulnerable communities.

(7) Serious global warming impacts have al-
1
ready been observed in the United States and world-
2
wide, including— 
3
(A) increases in heat waves and other ex-
4
treme weather events; 
5
(B) rise in sea level, retreat of glaciers and 
6
polar ice; 
7
(C) decline in mountain snowpack, in-
8
creased drought (including droughts in the 
9
West and South United States) resulting in 
10
damage to our economy and property; 
11
(D) extreme weather conditions resulting 
12
in wildfires, stronger hurricanes, and polar vor-
13
tex occurrences resulting in further damage to 
14
property and our economy; 
15
(E) damage to our environment such as 
16
ocean acidification, extensive coral bleaching, 
17
migrations, and shifts in the yearly cycles of 
18
plants and animals; and 
19
(F) effects on human population, including 
20
population displacement and adverse health ef-
21
fects such as the spread of infectious diseases 
22
and climate-related conditions such as asthma. 
23
(8) Scientists project that under a midrange es-
24
timate of global warming, by 2050, roughly 25 per-
25

cent of animal and plant species will be committed 
1
to extinction. 
2
(9) After remaining steady from 2014 to 2016, 
3
global carbon dioxide emissions increased 1.6 per-
4
cent in 2017. 
5
(10) Decisive action is needed to minimize the 
6
many dangers posed by global warming. 
7
(11) The timing of such action is critical, given 
8
that greenhouse gases can persist in the atmosphere 
9
for more than a century. 
10
(12) With less than 5 percent of the world pop-
11
ulation, the United States emits approximately 15 
12
percent of the world’s total greenhouse gas emissions 
13
and must be a leader in addressing global warming. 
14
(13) The State of California, the 5th largest 
15
economy in the world, has shown that renewable en-
16
ergy standards and greenhouse gas emissions regula-
17
tion can reduce greenhouse gas emissions while fos-
18
tering significant economic growth. 
19
(14) Existing energy efficiency and clean, re-
20
newable energy technologies can reduce global warm-
21
ing pollution, while saving consumers money, reduc-
22
ing our dependence on oil, enhancing national secu-
23
rity, cleaning the air, and protecting pristine places 
24
from drilling and mining.

(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of the 
1
Congress that the United States should participate in ne-
2
gotiations under the 1992 United Nations Framework 
3
Convention on Climate Change and honor its commit-
4
ments therefrom with the objective of securing and con-
5
tinuing United States participation in agreements, includ-
6
ing the Paris Agreement that the United States accepted 
7
on September 3, 2016, and took effect on November 4, 
8
2016, that— 
9
(1) establish mitigation commitments by all 
10
countries that are major emitters of greenhouse 
11
gases, consistent with the principle of common but 
12
differentiated responsibilities; 
13
(2) achieve reductions in global greenhouse gas 
14
emissions at a pace and level sufficient to avoid dan-
15
gerous interference with the Earth’s climate; and 
16
(3) advance and protect the economic and na-
17
tional security interests of the United States.
