Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Air Travel Public

Health Emergency Protection Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 7128 IH
(1) Passenger air travel is or can be a major 
1
vector in the spread of certain communicable dis-
2
eases such as COVID–19. 
3
(2) Air passengers who have been infected by 
4
such communicable diseases, especially during a de-
5
clared national public health emergency, present a 
6
serious public health risk not only to their fellow 
7
passengers but to all who come in contact with them 
8
at their destinations and upon their return. 
9
(3) Further, such air passengers present a seri-
10
ous negative economic consequence to the airlines on 
11
which they fly and to the destinations at which they 
12
arrive, especially destinations reliant on the travel 
13
and tourism industry, as they destroy public con-
14
fidence in the health and safety of air travel and of 
15
such destinations. 
16
(4) The best mechanism to address these nega-
17
tive consequences during a declared national public 
18
health emergency is for potential air passengers to 
19
be tested for symptoms of the relevant commu-
20
nicable disease before boarding airlines and to be de-
21
nied boarding if such symptoms are indicated. 
22
(5) The Federal Aviation Administration has 
23
taken the position that it does not have existing 
24
statutory authority to impose a public health-related 
25

•HR 7128 IH
requirement on passenger airlines that they test all 
1
potential air passengers for symptoms of the rel-
2
evant communicable disease before boarding airlines 
3
and deny boarding if such symptoms are indicated, 
4
and further that individual States are not authorized 
5
to impose such requirements in the exercise of their 
6
police power to protect the public health and foster 
7
economic and social stability. 
8
(6) As a result, some States, in furtherance of 
9
those goals, have been required to adopt far more 
10
risky and less effective methods which consume 
11
scarce resources, including a post-arrival self-polic-
12
ing quarantine which is widely disregarded. 
13
SEC. 3. PURPOSE. 
14
The purpose of this Act shall be to authorize any 
15
State to impose reasonable public health-protective condi-
16
tions on the boarding of any passenger on a passenger 
17
airline at the point of origin of a direct flight to such State 
18
during a public health emergency.

Aviation Administration shall allow States, territories of
