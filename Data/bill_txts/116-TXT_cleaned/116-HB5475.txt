SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
3
Congress finds the following: 
4
(1) A child’s brain grows at a faster rate be-
5
tween birth and age 3 than at any later point in the 
6
child’s lifetime.

(2) Decades of research shows that children 
1
under age 3 that receive quality child care are more 
2
likely to have the behavioral, cognitive, and language 
3
skills development necessary for success in school, 
4
college, and life. 
5
(3) According to a 2018 survey, 83 percent of 
6
parents with a child under age 5 responded that 
7
finding quality, affordable child care was a serious 
8
problem in their area. 
9
(4) In 2017, on average, center-based child care 
10
for an infant cost 61 percent more than for a pre-
11
schooler, over $11,000 annually per child, and in 28 
12
States, more than the cost of public college tuition. 
13
(5) In the 2015–2016 academic year, approxi-
14
mately 4,300,000 postsecondary education students 
15
were raising children while in college, and over half 
16
of those students had children preschool-aged or 
17
younger. 
18
(6) According to a 2016 survey, 95 percent of 
19
child care centers at 2-year and 4-year colleges 
20
across the United States had a waiting list, with the 
21
average list containing 82 children. 
22
(7) Student parents were 20 percent more likely 
23
to leave college without a degree than students with-
24
out children.

(8) The Child Care Access Means Parents in 
1
School Federal Grant program under subpart 7 of 
2
part A of title IV of the Higher Education Act of 
3
1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070e et seq.) helps over 3,300 
4
students at institutions of higher education afford 
5
child care each year, but this program impacts just 
6
0.5 percent of the entire student parent population, 
7
and many institutions of higher education do not 
8
open their subsidized child care programs to children 
9
under age 3. 
10
(9) The share of community colleges and 4-year 
11
institutions of higher education with on-campus 
12
child care has been in decline. Community colleges 
13
saw a 10 percent decrease in the number of cam-
14
puses with child care between 2002 and 2017. 
15
(10) Student parents are more likely to be en-
16
rolled at community colleges and minority-serving 
17
institutions than other institutions of higher edu-
18
cation. Over a quarter of all community college stu-
19
dents are parents, and in the 2015–2016 academic 
20
year, 40 percent of Black women attending college 
21
were parents, 3 times the rate for White male col-
22
lege students.
