ment of a National Infrastructure Development Bank, 
and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘National Infrastruc-
4
ture Development Bank Act of 2019’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Investment in infrastructure has always cre-
8
ated jobs and economic growth for the United States 
9
and has been a key component of maintaining a 
10
global competitive edge for the United States. 
11
(2) The Erie Canal, the transcontinental rail-
12
road, the Hoover Dam, rural electrification, and the 
13
interstate highway system are all examples of invest-
14
ments in infrastructure that created the conditions 
15
for future economic growth. 
16
(3) According to the American Society of Civil 
17
Engineers, the current condition of the infrastruc-
18
ture in the United States earns a grade point aver-
19
age of D+, and an estimated $4,690,000,000,000 
20
investment is needed by 2025 to meet adequate con-
21
ditions. 
22
(4) According to the American Water Works 
23
Association, an estimated $1 trillion is necessary to 
24
21:56 Jan 31, 2019

•HR 658 IH
maintain and expand service to meet demands over 
1
the next 25 years. 
2
(5) Most electric transmission and distribution 
3
lines were constructed in the 1950s and 1960s with 
4
a 50-year life expectancy, and the more than 
5
640,000 miles of high-voltage transmission lines in 
6
the lower 48 States power grids are at full capacity. 
7
(6) Although grant programs of the Govern-
8
ment must continue to play a central role in financ-
9
ing the transportation, environment, energy, and 
10
telecommunications infrastructure needs of the 
11
United States, current and foreseeable demands on 
12
existing Federal, State, and local funding for infra-
13
structure expansion exceed the resources to support 
14
these programs by margins wide enough to prompt 
15
serious concerns about the United States ability to 
16
sustain long-term economic development, produc-
17
tivity, and international competitiveness. 
18
(7) The capital markets, including central 
19
banks, pension funds, financial institutions, sov-
20
ereign wealth funds, and insurance companies, have 
21
a growing interest in infrastructure investment. The 
22
establishment of a United States Government-owned 
23
institution that would provide this investment oppor-
24
tunity to finance qualifying infrastructure projects
