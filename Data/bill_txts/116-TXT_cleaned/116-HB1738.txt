and sexual abuse occurring throughout the world; 
2
(2) major loopholes in Federal law have allowed

4
riages; 
5
(3) under the Immigration and Nationality Act

14
cated for preventing and reducing the occurrence of

•HR 1738 IH
(6) acknowledges that although the Federal 
1
Government is limited in its ability to address child 
2
marriage within individual States, establishing a 
3
minimum age of 18 years for marriage-based and 
4
fiance´-based immigrant visa petitions is an imme-
5
diate and viable solution for preventing child mar-
6
riage through exploitation of the United States im-
7
migration system; 
8
(7) affirms that child well being is a foremost 
9
priority and consideration when imposing strict age 
10
requirements for visa spousal and fiance´ petitions 
11
within the United States immigration system; 
12
(8) recognizes that under the current immigra-
13
tion legal framework, individuals may exploit visa 
14
marriage and fiance´ petitions for nefarious purposes, 
15
including— 
16
(A) coercing forced marriages; and 
17
(B) the trafficking and abuse of children;
