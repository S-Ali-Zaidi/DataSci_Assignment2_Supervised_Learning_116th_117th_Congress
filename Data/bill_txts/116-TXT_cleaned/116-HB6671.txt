A BILL 
To amend title 23, United States Code, to aid States in 
the deployment of fueling infrastructure to increase the 
use of higher blends of biofuels, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:

•HR 6671 IH
(1) According to the Energy Information Ad-
1
ministration, 
United 
States 
fuel 
consumption 
2
reached a new record high in 2018, breaking the 
3
previous record from 2007. 
4
(2) Biofuels are an immediately available path 
5
toward decarbonizing the transportation sector while 
6
lowering fuel prices, driving economic growth, and 
7
creating jobs. 
8
(3) Ninety-eight percent of the gasoline sold in 
9
the United States already uses a 10 percent ethanol 
10
blend, E10. 
11
(4) E15 has been approved since 2011 for any 
12
car or light truck model year 2001 or later, and as 
13
of January 2020, it is sold at 2,081 locations in 30 
14
States primarily at independently owned gas sta-
15
tions. 
16
(5) On May 30, 2019, the Environmental Pro-
17
tection Agency issued a final rule titled ‘‘Modifica-
18
tions to Fuel Regulations to Provide Flexibility for 
19
E15 and to Elements of the Renewable Identifica-
20
tion Number Compliance System’’ to permit year- 
21
round sale of E15. 
22
(6) E15 is dispensed using blender pumps or 
23
dedicated E15 pumps.

(7) In addition to flex-fuel infrastructure to dis-
1
pense E85, all major United States pump manufac-
2
turers offer pumps certified for blends up to 25 per-
3
cent ethanol. 
4
(8) Pilot programs have demonstrated that pub-
5
lic-private partnerships increase the installation rate 
6
of fueling infrastructure for higher blends of eth-
7
anol, with the USDA Biofuel Infrastructure Part-
8
nership delivering $100,000,000 to 21 States to as-
9
sist 1,486 stations install 4,880 pumps and 515 
10
tanks. 
11
(9) The United States has used more than 2.6 
12
billion gallons of biomass-based diesel each year 
13
since 2016 for on-road transport, heating applica-
14
tions, and jet fuel. 
15
(10) Nearly all United States diesel engine 
16
original equipment manufacturers approve the use of 
17
biodiesel blends up to B20 and renewable diesel up 
18
to 100 percent. 
19
(11) Multiple States have enacted or are poised 
20
to adopt requirements and incentives for blending 
21
biodiesel and renewable diesel into distillate fuels for 
22
transportation and heating. 
23
(12) The greatest barriers to biodiesel distribu-
24
tion are at the terminal and pipeline terminal level,

as well as rail to reach distribution centers. 
1
Incentivizing terminals would make fuel widely avail-
2
able and would be helpful for a larger penetration of 
3
biodiesel. 
4
(13) Investment will accelerate the increased 
5
use of higher blends of biofuels and quickly cut 
6
greenhouse gas emissions while lowering gas prices 
7
and driving economic growth.
