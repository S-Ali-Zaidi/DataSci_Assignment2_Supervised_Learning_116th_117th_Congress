PRODUCTION

SEC. 101. POLICY. 
11
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—Congress finds the fol-
12
lowing: 
13
(1) The assured supply of critical minerals and 
14
the resiliency of their supply chains are essential to 
15
the economic prosperity and national defense of the 
16
United States. 
17
(2) The United States is heavily dependent on 
18
foreign sources of critical minerals and on foreign 
19
supply chains resulting in the potential for strategic 
20
vulnerabilities to both the economy and the military. 
21
(3) As deployment of clean energy technologies 
22
and emissions control devices increase, the demand 
23
for critical minerals will grow significantly.

•HR 7061 IH
(4) The United States is import-reliant for 31 
1
of the 35 minerals designated as critical by the De-
2
partment of the Interior and relies completely on im-
3
ports to supply its demand for 14 of these minerals. 
4
(5) Over the past two decades China has pro-
5
duced more than 80 percent of the world’s produc-
6
tion of rare-earth elements and processed chemicals. 
7
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
8
gress that to break from China’s control on the mineral 
9
supply chain, the United States should support significant 
10
research and development activities to drive innovation in 
11
domestic critical minerals production, promote responsible 
12
development of critical minerals, and encourage inter-
13
national collaboration to limit the impact of mineral sup-
14
ply disruptions. 
15
(c) IN GENERAL.—Section 3 of the National Mate-
16
rials and Minerals Policy, Research and Development Act 
17
of 1980 (30 U.S.C. 1602) is amended— 
18

19
lows: 
20
‘‘(3) establish an analytical and forecasting ca-
21

22

(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
8
gress that— 
9
(1) critical minerals are fundamental to the 
10
economy, competitiveness, and security of the United

ical mineral needs of the United States should be 
14
satisfied by minerals, elements, substances, and ma-
15
terials responsibly produced and recycled in the

17
(3) the Federal permitting process has been 
18
identified as an impediment to mineral production
