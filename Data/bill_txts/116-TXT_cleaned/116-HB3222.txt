SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘No Federal Funds for 
2
Public Charge Act of 2019’’.

SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
4
It is the sense of Congress that— 
5
(1) immigrants and their families are a core 
6
part of our Nation; 
7
(2) their health and safety is critical to the 
8
health and safety of our communities; 
9
(3) Federal, State, and local assistance pro-
10
grams promote self-sufficiency by ensuring that fam-
11
ilies, including immigrant and mixed-status families, 
12
maintain their health, strength, and stability, and 
13
can continue contributing to the Nation’s social and 
14
economic life; 
15
(4) the proposed rule of the Department of 
16
Homeland Security entitled ‘‘Inadmissibility on Pub-
17
lic Charge Grounds’’ is a sweeping and dangerous 
18
proposal that will impede access to essential food, 
19
medical care, and housing for many families; 
20
(5) the proposed rule would damage State and 
21
local economies while burdening health and service 
22
providers, and the Department of Homeland Secu-
23
rity itself, in the preamble of the proposed rule, ac-
24
knowledges the severe consequences of this proposal 
25
including that it could cause ‘‘worse health out-

comes, including increased prevalence of obesity and 
1
malnutrition, especially for pregnant or breastfeed-
2
ing women, infants, or children’’, that it may ‘‘de-
3
crease disposable income and increase the poverty of 
4
certain families and children, including U.S. citizen 
5
children’’ and that it could lead to ‘‘reduced reve-
6
nues for healthcare providers’’, ‘‘pharmacies’’, ‘‘com-
7
panies that manufacture medical supplies or phar-
8
maceuticals’’, ‘‘grocery retailers’’, and ‘‘agricultural 
9
producers’’; and 
10
(6) the proposed rule would circumvent Con-
11
gress and reverse 100 years of law and policy, re-
12
stricting immigration and chilling access to services 
13
for which immigrants and their citizen family mem-
14
bers are eligible, in a manner not authorized or con-
15
templated by Congress. 
16
SEC. 3. RESTRICTION ON FEDERAL FUNDS. 
17
No Federal funds (including fees) made available for 
18
any fiscal year, may be used to implement, administer, en-
19
force, or carry out the proposed rule of the Department 
20
of Homeland Security entitled ‘‘Inadmissibility on Public 
21
Charge Grounds’’.
