Whereas National Foster Care Month was established more 
than 20 years ago to— 
(1) bring foster care issues to the forefront; 
(2) highlight the importance of permanency for 
every child; and 
(3) recognize the essential role that foster parents, 
social workers, and advocates have in the lives of children 
in foster care throughout the United States; 
Whereas all children deserve a safe, loving, and permanent 
home; 
Whereas the primary goal of the foster care system is to en-
sure the safety and well-being of children while working 
to provide a safe, loving, and permanent home for each 
child; 
Whereas, in 2017, there were approximately 443,000 children 
living in foster care; 
Whereas there were approximately 269,690 youth that en-
tered the foster care system in 2017, while over 117,794 
youth were eligible and awaiting adoption at the end of 
2017; 
Whereas children of color are more likely to stay in the foster 
care system for longer periods of time and are less likely 
to be reunited with their biological families; 
Whereas foster parents are the front-line caregivers for chil-
dren who cannot safely remain with their biological par-
ents and provide physical care, emotional support, edu-
cation advocacy, and are the largest single source of fam-
ilies providing permanent homes for children leaving fos-
ter care to adoption; 
Whereas children in foster care who are placed with relatives, 
compared to children placed with nonrelatives, have more

stability, including fewer changes in placements, have 
more positive perceptions of their placements, are more 
likely to be placed with their siblings, and demonstrate 
fewer behavioral problems; 
Whereas some relative caregivers receive less financial assist-
ance and support services than do foster caregivers; 
Whereas recent studies show foster children enrolled in Med-
icaid were prescribed antipsychotic medications at nearly 
4 times the rate of other children receiving Medicaid; 
Whereas youth in foster care are much more likely to face 
educational instability with 65 percent of former foster 
children experiencing at least 7 school changes while in 
care; 
Whereas an increased emphasis on prevention and reunifica-
tion services is necessary to reduce the number of chil-
dren that are forced to remain in the foster care system; 
Whereas more than 19,945 youth ‘‘aged out’’ of foster care 
in 2017 without a legal permanent connection to an adult 
or family; 
Whereas the number of youth who age out of foster care has 
steadily increased for the past decade; 
Whereas foster care is intended to be a temporary placement, 
but children remain in the foster care system for an aver-
age of 19.2 years; 
Whereas children in foster care experience an average of 3 
different placements, which often leads to disruption of 
routines and the need to change schools and move away 
from siblings, extended families, and familiar sur-
roundings;

•HRES 340 IH 
Whereas children entering foster care often confront the 
widespread misperception that children in foster care are 
disruptive, unruly, and dangerous, even though placement 
in foster care is based on the actions of a parent or 
guardian, not the child; 
Whereas children who age out of foster care lack the security 
or support of a biological or adoptive family and fre-
quently struggle to secure affordable housing, obtain 
health insurance, pursue higher education, and acquire 
adequate employment; 
Whereas on average, 8.5 percent of the positions in child pro-
tective services remain vacant; 
Whereas due to heavy caseloads and limited resources, the 
average tenure for a worker in child protection services 
is just 3 years; 
Whereas States, localities, and communities should be encour-
aged to invest resources in preventative and reunification 
services and postpermanency programs to ensure that 
more children in foster care are provided with safe, lov-
ing, and permanent placements; 
Whereas Federal legislation over the past 3 decades, includ-
ing the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 
1980 (Public Law 96–272), the Adoption and Safe Fami-
lies Act of 1997 (Public Law 105–89), the Fostering 
Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 
2008 (Public Law 110–351), the Child and Family Serv-
ices Improvement and Innovation Act (Public Law 112– 
34), the Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening 
Families Act (Public Law 113–183), and title VII of divi-
sion E of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, also known 
as the Family First Prevention Services Act (Public Law

115–123), provided new investments and services to im-
prove the outcomes of children in the foster care system; 
Whereas May 2019 is an appropriate month to designate as 
National Foster Care Month to provide an opportunity to 
acknowledge the accomplishments of the child welfare 
workforce, foster parents, advocacy community, and men-
tors for their dedication, accomplishments, and positive 
impact they have on the lives of children; and 
Whereas much remains to be done to ensure that all children 
have a safe, loving, nurturing, and permanent family, re-
gardless of age or special needs: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—

(1) supports the designation of National Foster
