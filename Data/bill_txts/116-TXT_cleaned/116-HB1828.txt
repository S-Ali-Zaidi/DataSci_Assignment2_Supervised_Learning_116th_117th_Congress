SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS. 
3
(a) SHORT TITLE.—This Act may be cited as the 
4
‘‘Ending Secrecy About Workplace Sexual Harassment 
5
Act’’. 
6
(b) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that the following:

•HR 1828 IH
(1) Thirty years after the United States Su-
1
preme Court held in Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson 
2
that sexual harassment creates a hostile or abusive 
3
work environment and is a violation of title VII of 
4
the Civil Rights Act of 1964, sexual harassment re-
5
mains a widespread problem, affecting victims in 
6
every industry, at every level of employment. 
7
(2) In fiscal year 2015, almost one-third of the 
8
90,000 charges filed with the Equal Employment 
9
Opportunity Commission involved harassment, and 
10
nearly a quarter of those harassment charges in-
11
volved sexual harassment. Of the total number of 
12
charges received that alleged harassment from em-
13
ployees working for private employers or for State 
14
and local government employers, approximately 45 
15
percent alleged harassment on the basis of sex. 
16
(3) According to the Commission’s Select Task 
17
Force in 2016, on the Study of Harassment in the 
18
Workplace, the prevalence of such harassment— 
19
(A) causes mental and physical harm to 
20
the victim, as the study concluded that ‘‘em-
21
ployees experiencing sexual harassment are 
22
more likely to report symptoms of depression, 
23
general stress and anxiety, posttraumatic stress 
24

disorder (PTSD), and overall impaired psycho-
1
logical well-being’’; 
2
(B) results in harms, which are not limited 
3
to victims, as the study concluded that ‘‘em-
4
ployees, female and male alike, who observed 
5
hostility directed toward female coworkers (both 
6
incivility and sexually harassing behavior) were 
7
more likely to experience lower psychological 
8
well-being’’, which were ‘‘in turn linked to lower 
9
physical well-being’’. 
10
(4) Prevalence of sexual harassment in the 
11
workplace causes substantial financial harm to vic-
12
tims, as they often try to avoid the harassing behav-
13
ior by taking leave without pay or leaving the work-
14
place entirely, resulting in a loss of wages. The U.S. 
15
Merit Systems Protection Board’s 1995 report on 
16
Sexual Harassment in the Federal Workplace found 
17
sexual harassment cost Federal employees $4.4 mil-
18
lion between 1992 and 1994. 
19
(5) According to Commission records, from fis-
20
cal year 2010 to 2016, U.S. companies have paid 
21
out more than $295 million in public penalties over 
22
sexual harassment claims. This sum does not include 
23
any private settlements or internally resolved com-

•HR 1828 IH
plaints about which there is limited public informa-
1
tion. 
2
(6) The Commission is responsible for enforcing 
3
Federal anti-discrimination laws that protect job ap-
4
plicants and employees, and has the authority to in-
5
vestigate charges of discrimination against employ-
6
ers who are covered by the law. 
7
(7) The Commission does not currently receive 
8
disclosures from employers on annual EEO–1 re-
9
ports regarding claims of discrimination on the basis 
10
of sex, including verbal and physical sexual harass-
11
ment made directly to the employer and resolved in-
12
ternally through out-of-court settlements or other 
13
mediation.
