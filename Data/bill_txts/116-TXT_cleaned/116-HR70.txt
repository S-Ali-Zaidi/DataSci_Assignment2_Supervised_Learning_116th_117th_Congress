RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the roles and the contributions of America’s 
Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists (CRNAs) and 
their role in providing quality health care for the public. 
Whereas Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists (CRNAs) 
are essential to America’s health care system, providing 
high-quality, cost-effective anesthesia care for more than 
150 years; 
Whereas CRNAs safely administer approximately 43 million 
anesthetics to patients each year; 
Whereas CRNAs are the primary providers of anesthesia care 
in rural America, enabling health care facilities in these 
medically underserved areas to offer obstetrical, surgical, 
trauma stabilization, and pain management services;

Whereas CRNAs practice in every setting in which anesthesia 
is delivered, including traditional hospital surgical suites 
and obstetrical delivery rooms; the offices of dentists, po-
diatrists, ophthalmologists, and plastic surgeons; ambula-
tory surgical centers; and United States Military and 
Public Health Services and Department of Veterans Af-
fairs medical facilities; 
Whereas nurse anesthetists first provided anesthesia to 
wounded soldiers during the American Civil War and 
have been the main provider of anesthesia care to United 
States military personnel on the front lines since World 
War I, including all current United States military ac-
tions around the globe; and 
Whereas the purpose of National CRNA Week, held January 
20, 2019, through January 26, 2019, is to raise public 
awareness of and celebrate the Nation’s 52,000 Certified 
Registered Nurse Anesthetists and student registered
