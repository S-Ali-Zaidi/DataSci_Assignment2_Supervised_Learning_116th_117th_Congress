(7) As the team celebrated on the field, chants 
8
of ‘‘Equal Pay’’ were reported in the stadium. This

experienced by the USWNT compared to their male

counterparts.

(8) The efforts of USWNT regarding wage in-

equity, in tandem with their continued success on 
15
the field, have advanced our Nation’s dialogue sur-
16

17
(9) The USWNT also serves as a powerful and 
18
visible advocate of the LGBTQ community in ath-

(10) Their work on these issues sets a powerful 
21
example to young women across the globe, particu-
22
larly women athletes, to stand up for equal treat-
23
ment.
