RESOLUTION 
Expressing opposition to banning service in the Armed 
Forces by openly transgender individuals. 
Whereas, on July 26, 2017, President Trump announced via 
Twitter that the United States Government would reverse 
the existing policy of allowing transgender servicemem-
bers to serve openly in order to implement a ban on 
transgender people from serving in the Armed Forces; 
Whereas transgender servicemembers have served openly 
since 2016, bravely defending our Nation with distinction 
while preserving unit cohesion and contributing to mili-
tary readiness; 
Whereas a 2016 study by the RAND Corporation found that 
allowing transgender Americans to serve openly in the 
Armed Forces would ‘‘have minimal impact on readiness 
and health care costs’’ and ‘‘little or no impact on unit 
cohesion, operational effectiveness or readiness’’; 
Whereas thousands of transgender Americans currently serve 
actively in the Armed Forces and in the Reserves 
throughout all branches and military occupational spe-
cialties; 
Whereas the American Medical Association, the American 
Psychological Association, the American Psychiatric As-
sociation, and three former military Surgeons General 
each have affirmed the medical efficacy of transition-re-
lated care and have expressed opposition to President 
Trump’s discriminatory ban; 
Whereas the claims attempting to justify President Trump’s 
ban are based on flawed scientific and medical assertions;

Whereas the Department of Defense report from 2018 falsely 
asserts there is ‘‘considerable scientific uncertainty’’ re-
garding the efficacy of transition-related care; 
Whereas there is a global medical consensus that such care 
is effective, safe, and reliable; 
Whereas the Department of Defense has failed to provide evi-
dence the existing policy has impaired morale, unit readi-
ness, or unit cohesion; 
Whereas all five military Chiefs of Staff have testified pub-
licly that the existing policy has had no adverse effect on 
military readiness; 
Whereas, on August 1, 2017, fifty-six retired generals and 
admirals released a statement affirming, ‘‘This proposed 
ban, if implemented, would cause significant disruptions, 
deprive the military of mission-critical talent, and com-
promise the integrity of transgender troops who would be 
forced to live a lie, as well as non-transgender peers who 
would be forced to choose between reporting their com-
rades or disobeying policy’’; 
Whereas at least 18 nations allow transgender people to serve 
openly and effectively in their armed forces; 
Whereas transgender members of the Armed Forces have 
fought in defense of our freedoms with honor and distinc-
tion since our Nation’s founding and have been bestowed 
with such commendations and awards as the Bronze Star 
and Purple Heart for their courage and sacrifices; 
Whereas President Trump’s ban on transgender members of 
the Armed Forces targets and stigmatizes a whole class 
of people; and 
Whereas President Trump’s ban on transgender members of 
the Armed Forces would affect all transgender members
