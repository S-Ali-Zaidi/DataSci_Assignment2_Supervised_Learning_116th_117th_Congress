RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the roles and the contributions of America’s 
certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs) and their 
role in providing quality health care for the public. 
Whereas certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs) are 
essential to America’s health care system, providing high- 
quality, cost-effective anesthesia care for more than 150 
years; 
Whereas CRNAs safely administer approximately 49 million 
anesthetics to patients each year; 
Whereas CRNAs are the primary providers of anesthesia care 
in rural America, enabling health care facilities in these 
medically underserved areas to offer obstetrical, surgical, 
trauma stabilization, and pain management services;

Whereas CRNAs practice in every setting in which anesthesia 
is delivered, including traditional hospital surgical suites 
and obstetrical delivery rooms; the offices of dentists, po-
diatrists, ophthalmologists, and plastic surgeons; ambula-
tory surgical centers; and United States Military and 
Public Health Services and Department of Veterans Af-
fairs medical facilities; 
Whereas nurse anesthetists first provided anesthesia to 
wounded soldiers during the Civil War and have been the 
main provider of anesthesia care to United States mili-
tary personnel on the front lines since World War I, in-
cluding all current United States military actions around 
the globe; and 
Whereas the purpose of National CRNA Week, held January 
19, 2020, through January 25, 2020, is to raise public 
awareness of and celebrate the Nation’s 54,000 certified 
registered nurse anesthetists and student registered
