•HR 3206 IH
(1) the Government of the Russian Federation, 
1
working through Russian state-owned enterprises, 
2
uses energy as a tool of coercion and political lever-
3
age; 
4
(2) the Government of Russia pursues a strat-
5
egy to make European countries dependent on Rus-
6
sia for energy supplies, so as to increase this polit-
7
ical leverage; 
8
(3) a central aspect to this Russian strategy is 
9
the development of export energy pipelines that are 
10
driven not by commercial viability but by the foreign 
11
policy goals of Russia; 
12
(4) the Nord Stream 2 pipeline and the Turk 
13
Stream pipeline are two examples of such Russian 
14
energy export pipelines; 
15
(5) the President should take action to halt 
16
such Russian energy export pipelines unless the 
17
President determines that doing so is not in the na-
18
tional interest of the United States; and 
19
(6) in making such a determination, the Presi-
20
dent should consider whether— 
21
(A) the non-Russian parties involved in the 
22
project have put in place safeguards to mini-
23
mize the ability of Russia to use the pipeline as 
24
a tool of coercion and political leverage, includ-

ing by requiring unbundling of energy produc-
1
tion and transmission, transparency in the en-
2
ergy market, and effective regulatory oversight; 
3
and 
4
(B) the non-Russian parties involved in the 
5
project have taken concrete steps to ensure that 
6
it will not result in a significant decrease in the 
7
transit of Russian energy exports through exist-
8
ing pipelines in other countries, particularly

Ukraine.
