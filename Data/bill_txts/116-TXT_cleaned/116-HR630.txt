RESOLUTION 
Condemning and censuring Adam Schiff, Representative of 
California’s 28th Congressional District. 
Whereas President Trump released the transcript of a call 
between him and the President of Ukraine; 
Whereas President Trump subsequently released the whistle-
blower complaint of August 12, 2019; 
Whereas, in a September 26, 2019, hearing on the whistle-
blower complaint, House Intelligence Committee Chair-
man Adam Schiff purported to relay the content of the 
phone call to the American people; 
Whereas, instead of quoting directly from the available tran-
script, Chairman Schiff manufactured a false retelling of 
the conversation between President Trump and President 
Zelensky;

Whereas this egregiously false and fabricated retelling had no 
relationship to the call itself; 
Whereas these actions of Chairman Schiff misled the Amer-
ican people, bring disrepute upon the House of Rep-
resentatives, and make a mockery of the impeachment 
process, one of this chamber’s most solemn constitutional 
duties; 
Whereas, for more than 2 years, Chairman Schiff has spread 
false accusations that the Trump campaign colluded with 
Russia; 
Whereas, on March 20, 2017, then-Ranking Member Schiff 
read out false allegations from the Steele dossier accusing 
numerous Trump associates of colluding with Russia; 
Whereas then-Ranking Member Schiff falsely claimed in a 
March 2017 interview to have ‘‘more than circumstantial 
evidence’’ of collusion with Russia; 
Whereas then-Ranking Member Schiff negotiated with Rus-
sian comedians whom he believed to be Ukrainian offi-
cials to obtain materials to damage the President of the 
United States politically; 
Whereas, according to a New York Times article on October 
2, 2019, Chairman Schiff’s committee staff met with the 
whistleblower prior to the filing of his complaint, and 
staff members communicated the content of the com-
plaint to Chairman Schiff; 
Whereas Chairman Schiff concealed his dealings with the 
whistleblower from the rest of the Intelligence Com-
mittee, and when asked directly in a television interview 
whether he had any contact with the whistleblower, he 
lied to the American people and said, ‘‘We have not spo-
ken directly with the whistleblower.’’;

•HRES 630 IH 
Whereas members of the Intelligence Committee have lost 
faith in his objectivity and capabilities as Chairman, with 
every Republican member on the Committee having 
signed a letter calling for his immediate resignation as 
Chairman; and 
Whereas Chairman Schiff has hindered the ability of the In-
telligence Committee to fulfill its oversight responsibilities 
of the Intelligence Community, an indispensable pillar of 
our national security: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That— 
1
(1) the House of Representatives censures and 
2
condemns Representative Adam Schiff for conduct 
3
that misleads the American people in a way that is 
4
not befitting an elected Member of the House of 
5
Representatives; 
6
(2) Representative Adam Schiff will forthwith 
7
present himself in the well of the House for the pro-
8
nouncement of censure; and 
9
(3) Representative Adam Schiff will be cen-
10
sured with the public reading of this resolution by 
11
the Speaker.
