RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the rise of cardiovascular disease as the world’s 
leading cause of preventable death and disability and 
as the global public health crisis of our generation and 
supporting the recognition of February 2019 as ‘‘Amer-
ican Heart Month’’. 
Whereas the World Health Organization estimates that in 
2016, 17.9 million people died from cardiovascular dis-
eases (CVDs) globally; 
Whereas, of these deaths, 85 percent were due to heart at-
tacks and strokes and over three-quarters of CVD deaths 
occur in low- and middle-income countries;

Whereas CVDs result in tremendous health care costs and 
lost productivity and, if not addressed, the United States 
alone will spend over 1 trillion dollars by 2035 on costs 
relating to CVD; 
Whereas the heavy burden of death and disability from CVDs 
can be decreased through changes in behavior linked to 
major risk factors, including reduced tobacco use and salt 
consumption and improvements in access to medical 
treatment and services; 
Whereas essential quality-assured medicines and technologies 
are critical components to address the global burden of 
CVDs; and 
Whereas United States leadership and support has strength-
ened surveillance, enhanced workforce capacity, and pro-
vided valuable technical exchanges in the area of CVD: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports recognition of American Heart 
2
Month to bring awareness to the cardiovascular dis-
3
ease (CVD) public health crisis in the United States 
4
and abroad; 
5
(2) affirms that the key to overcoming CVDs is 
6
prevention and early detection and treatment to re-
7
duce long-term disability and mortality; 
8
(3) urges the deployment of United States tech-
9
nical expertise on CVDs in support of developing ca-
10
pacities and strengthening of the health care sys-
11
tems of other countries;
