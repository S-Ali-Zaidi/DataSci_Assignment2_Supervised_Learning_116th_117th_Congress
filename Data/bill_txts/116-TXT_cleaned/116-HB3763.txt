SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Market analysts estimate that in the United 
3
States, 5G technologies could create up to 3,000,000 
4
new jobs and add $500,000,000,000 to the country’s 
5
gross domestic product. Globally, analysts estimate 
6
that 
5G 
technologies 
could 
generate 
7
$12,300,000,000,000 in sales activity across mul-
8
tiple industries and support 22,000,000 jobs by 
9
2035. 
10
(2) China is the most active espionage power 
11
when it comes to industrial espionage, theft of intel-
12
lectual property, and actions against groups or coun-
13
tries that the regime perceives as threatening. Its 
14
targets go well beyond the United States and include 
15
any country where China has interests and access. 
16
There are credible reports of China taking advan-
17
tage of network equipment supplied by its companies 
18
for intelligence advantage that date back almost two 
19
decades. 
20
(3) In the last year, China has ignored agree-
21
ments between China, the United States, and others 
22
not to engage in commercial espionage, and efforts 
23
to acquire American, European, and Asian tech-
24
nology have reached an unprecedented level.

(4) A recent report by the Defense Innovation 
1
Board lists a number of difficulties facing the de-
2
ployment of 5G technologies in the United States 
3
and concludes that ‘‘The country that owns 5G will 
4
own many of these innovations and set the stand-
5
ards for the rest of the world. . . .’’. 
6
(5) Standards adopted at international bodies, 
7
such as the International Telecommunication Union, 
8
the 3rd Generation Partnership Project, and the 5G 
9
Infrastructure Public Private Partnership, are crit-
10
ical to the global economy and to ensuring that net-
11
works and technology can connect globally. 
12
(6) The 2018 report to Congress by the U.S.- 
13
China Economic and Security Review Commission 
14
states that ‘‘International 5G standards will be set 
15
by 2019, facilitating large-scale commercial deploy-
16
ment expected by 2020. The Chinese government is 
17
encouraging its companies to play a greater role in 
18
international 5G standards organizations to ensure 
19
they set global standards; such leadership may result 
20
in higher revenues and exports from internationally 
21
accepted intellectual property and technology and 
22
more global influence over future wireless technology 
23
and standards development.’’.

•HR 3763 IH
(7) China’s Made in China 2025 initiative is 
1
driving support to Chinese companies to increasingly 
2
participate in and dominate international standards- 
3
setting bodies so that it can restructure the global 
4
marketplace and dominate economically strategic in-
5
dustries. 
6
(8) Chinese officials have assumed a greater 
7
number of leadership roles at the International Tele-
8
communication Union, an intergovernmental public- 
9
private partnership under the United Nations that 
10
allocates global radio spectrum and satellite orbits 
11
and establishes international technical standards for 
12
information and communication technologies. 
13
(9) Patented technology is used in international 
14
standards and a company that owns the patent nec-
15
essary to comply with international standards (also 
16
known as a standards-essential patent) gains global 
17
market share, licensing revenues, and a competitive 
18
edge in subsequent technology development. As such, 
19
the Chinese government, through its Made in China 
20
2025 and Internet Plus initiatives, is seeking to 
21
dominate the international standards-setting bodies 
22
so as to create an unfair advantage for Chinese com-
23
panies as the world adopts 5G technologies.

(10) General Joseph Dunford, Chairman of the 
1
Joint Chiefs of Staff, testified before the House 
2
Committee on Appropriations on May 1, 2019, that 
3
‘‘One of the things that underlines an alliance is the 
4
ability to share information, and when we share in-
5
formation with allies and partners we have to have 
6
common standards of information assurance. We 
7
have to be sure that our secrets are protected, 
8
whether it be intelligence or technology transfer.’’.

(11) On May 3, 2019, the Prague 5G Security 
10
Conference, which was widely attended by represent-
11
atives from the European Union, and the North At-
12
lantic Treaty Organization, including the United 
13
States, produced the Prague Proposals, which state 
14
that ‘‘communication networks and services should 
15
be designed with resilience and security in mind’’.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
17
It is the sense of Congress that— 
18
(1) the United States and its allies and part-
19
ners should maintain participation and leadership at 
20
international standards-setting bodies for 5th and 
21
future generations mobile telecommunications sys-
22
tems and infrastructure; 
23
(2) the United States should work with its allies 
24
and partners to encourage and facilitate the develop-

ment of secure supply chains and networks for 5th

and future generations mobile telecommunications 
2
systems and infrastructure; and 
3
(3) the maintenance of a standard of security 
4
in telecommunications and cyber between the United 
5
States and its allies and partners is a vital strategic 
6
and security interest of the United States.
