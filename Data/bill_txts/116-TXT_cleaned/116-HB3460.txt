SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
1
It is the policy of the United States to support a 
2
broad range of implementation and research and develop-
3
ment activities that work toward the achievement of cost- 
4
effective and sustainable treatment, control, and, where 
5
possible, elimination of neglected tropical diseases for the 
6
economic and social well-being of all people. 
7
SEC. 4. FINDINGS. 
8
Congress finds the following: 
9
(1) The World Health Organization (WHO) has 
10
identified 17 neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). 
11
Approximately 2 billion people, almost one-third of 
12
the world’s population, are at risk of contracting an 
13
NTD, and more than 1.4 billion people are currently 
14
afflicted with 1 or more NTDs. 
15
(2) In 2013, WHO adopted a comprehensive 
16
resolution on NTDs recognizing that increased na-
17
tional and international investments in prevention 
18
and control of neglected tropical diseases have suc-
19
ceeded in improving health and social well-being in 
20
many countries. 
21
(3) NTDs have an enormous impact in terms of 
22
disease burden and quality of life. NTDs cause the 
23
loss of up to 534,000 lives and 57 million disability- 
24
01:36 Jun 26, 2019
H3460

•HR 3460 IH
adjusted life-years each year. NTDs surpass both 
1
malaria and tuberculosis in causing greater loss of 
2
life-years to disability and premature death. Many 
3
NTDs cause disfigurement and disability, leading to 
4
stigma, 
social 
discrimination, 
and 
societal 
5
marginalization. 
6
(4) NTDs create an economic burden of billions 
7
of dollars through the loss of productivity and high 
8
costs of health care required for treatment. People 
9
afflicted by NTDs are less productive than their 
10
healthy counterparts. NTDs jeopardize the ability of 
11
people to attend work and school, or to produce at 
12
full capacity. For example, controlling one NTD, 
13
hookworm, in children can result in a 43-percent in-
14
crease in future wage earnings. 
15
(5) The social, economic, and health burden of 
16
NTDs falls primarily on low- and middle-income 
17
countries, where access to safe water, sanitation, 
18
and health care is limited. At least 100 countries 
19
face 2 endemic NTD burdens, and 30 countries 
20
carry 6 or more endemic NTDs. 
21
(6) NTDs are not confined to the developing 
22
world, however. Several NTD outbreaks have been 
23
reported in the United States and other developed 
24
countries, especially among the poor. In the United 
25
01:36 Jun 26, 2019
H3460
4 
•HR 3460 IH
States, NTDs disproportionately affect people living 
1
in poverty, and especially minorities, including up to 
2
2.8 million African Americans with toxocariasis and 
3
300,000 or more people, mostly Hispanic Americans, 
4
with Chagas disease. 
5
(7) Many NTDs can be controlled, prevented, 
6
and even eliminated using low-cost, effective, and 
7
feasible solutions. Understanding the economic bur-
8
den of NTDs on productivity and health care costs 
9
can help to assure governments and donors that the 
10
resources directed toward NTDs represent a good 
11
investment. 
12
(8) Research and development efforts are imme-
13
diately needed for all NTDs, especially those for 
14
which limited or no treatment currently exists. 
15
(9) Critical to developing robust NTD control 
16
strategies are epidemiological data that identify at- 
17
risk populations, ensure appropriate treatment fre-
18
quency, and inform decisions about when treatment 
19
can be reduced or stopped. 
20
(10) Of the 14 most common NTDs, roughly 
21
80 percent of infections are caused by soil-trans-
22
mitted helminths (STH) and schistosomiasis. STH 
23
are a group of 3 parasitic worms (roundworms, 
24
whipworms, and hookworms) that afflict more than 
25
01:36 Jun 26, 2019
H3460
5 
•HR 3460 IH
1 billion people worldwide, including 600 million 
1
school-age children, of whom more than 300 million 
2
suffer from severe morbidity. Schistosomiasis is an-
3
other helminth infection affecting at least 200 mil-
4
lion people in developing countries, but some esti-
5
mates indicate that the true number of people af-
6
fected may be double or even triple that number. 
7
(11) The benefits of deworming are immediate 
8
and enduring. A rigorous randomized controlled trial 
9
has shown school-based deworming treatment to re-
10
duce school absenteeism by 25 percent. School-based 
11
deworming also benefits young siblings and other 
12
children who live nearby but are too young to be 
13
treated, leading to large cognitive improvements 
14
equivalent to half a year of schooling.

SEC. 7. EXPANSION OF UNITED STATES AGENCY FOR 
1
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT NEGLECTED 
2
TROPICAL DISEASES PROGRAM. 
3
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
4
(1) Since fiscal year 2006, the United States 
5
Government has been an essential leader in global 
6
efforts to control seven targeted neglected tropical 
7
diseases: 
lymphatic 
filariasis 
(elephantiasis), 
8
onchocerciasis (river blindness), schistosomiasis, soil- 
9
transmitted helminthiases (roundworm, whipworm, 
10
and hookworm), and trachoma. Additional informa-
11
tion suggests that such efforts could also produce 
12
collateral benefits for at least three other neglected 
13
tropical diseases: foodborne trematodiases, scabies, 
14
and yaws (endemic treponematoses). 
15
(2) The United States Government is a partner 
16
in the London Declaration on Neglected Tropical 
17
Diseases (2012), which represents a new, coordi-
18
nated international push to accelerate progress to-
19
ward eliminating or controlling 10 NTDs by 2020. 
20
(3) While many of the most common NTDs 
21
have safe, easy to use, and effective treatments, 
22
treatment options for the NTDs with the highest 
23
death 
rates, 
including 
human 
African 
24
trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness), visceral leishma-
25
niasis, and Chagas disease, are extremely limited.

(4) The United States Agency for International 
1
Development (USAID) Neglected Tropical Diseases 
2
Program has made important and substantial con-
3
tributions to the global fight to control and eliminate 
4
5 of the most common NTDs. Leveraging more than 
5
$15,700,000,000 in donated medicines, USAID has 
6
supported the distribution of more than 1 billion 
7
treatments in 31 countries across Africa, Asia, and 
8
Latin America and the Caribbean. 
9
(5) Since 2014, the USAID Neglected Tropical 
10
Diseases Program has been investing in research 
11
and development for the treatment of certain NTDs 
12
to ensure that promising new breakthrough medi-
13
cines can be rapidly evaluated, registered, and made 
14
available to patients. 
15
(6) The USAID Neglected Tropical Diseases 
16
Program is a clear example of a successful public- 
17
private partnership between the Government and the 
18
private sector and should be judiciously expanded, as 
19
practicable and appropriate.

(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
21
gress that the USAID Neglected Tropical Diseases Pro-
22

(2) better integrate NTD control and treatment 
6
tools and approaches into complementary develop-
7
ment and global health programs by coordinating, to 
8
the extent practicable and appropriate, across mul-
9
tiple sectors, including those relating to HIV/AIDS, 
10
malaria, tuberculosis, education, nutrition, other in-
11
fectious diseases, maternal and child health, and 
12
water, sanitation, and hygiene; 
13
(3) establish low-cost, high-impact community- 
14
and school-based NTD programs to reach large at- 
15
risk populations, including school-age children, with 
16
integrated drug treatment packages, as feasible; 
17
(4) as opportunities emerge and resources 
18
allow, engage in research and development of new 
19
tools and approaches to reach the goals relating to 
20
the elimination of NTDs as set forth by the 2012

order to accurately measure impact, identify and 
14
share lessons learned, and inform future NTD con-
15
trol and elimination strategies. 
16
(2) Coordinating program activities with com-
17
plementary USAID development and global health 
18
programs, including programs relating to water, 
19
sanitation, and hygiene, food and nutrition security, 
20
