SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Hidden Figures Con-
2
gressional Gold Medal Act’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) In 1935, the National Advisory Committee 
6
for Aeronautics (referred to in this section as 
7
‘‘NACA’’) hired 5 women to serve as the first ‘‘com-
8
puter pool’’ at the Langley Memorial Aeronautical 
9
Laboratory where those women took on work mak-
10
ing calculations that male engineers had made pre-
11
viously. 
12
(2) During the 1940s, NACA began recruiting 
13
African-American women to work as computers and 
14
initially separated those women from their White 
15
counterparts in a group known as the ‘‘West Area 
16
Computers’’ where the women were restricted to seg-
17
regated dining and bathroom facilities. 
18
(3) Katherine Johnson was born on August 26, 
19
1918, in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia. 
20
(4) In 1953, Katherine Johnson began her ca-
21
reer in aeronautics as a computer in the segregated 
22
West Area Computing unit described in paragraph 
23
(2). 
24
(5) As a member of the Flight Research Divi-
25
sion, Katherine Johnson analyzed data from flight

tests. After NACA was reformulated into the Na-
1
tional Aeronautics and Space Administration (re-
2
ferred to in this section as ‘‘NASA’’), Katherine 
3
Johnson— 
4
(A) calculated the trajectory for Alan 
5
Shepard’s Freedom 7 mission in 1961, which 
6
was the first human spaceflight by an indi-
7
vidual from the United States; 
8
(B) coauthored a report that provided the 
9
equations for describing orbital spaceflight with 
10
a specified landing point, which made her the 
11
first woman to be recognized as an author of a 
12
report from the Flight Research Division; 
13
(C) was asked to verify the calculations 
14
when electronic computers at NASA were used 
15
to calculate the orbit for John Glenn’s Friend-
16
ship 7 mission; and 
17
(D) 
provided 
calculations 
for 
NASA 
18
throughout her career, including for the Apollo 
19
missions. 
20
(6) Katherine Johnson retired from NASA in 
21
1986. 
22
(7) Dr. Christine Darden was born on Sep-
23
tember 10, 1942, in Monroe, North Carolina.

(8) In 1962, Dr. Christine Darden graduated 
1
from Hampton Institute with a B.S. in Mathematics 
2
and a teaching credential. 
3
(9) Dr. Christine Darden attended Virginia 
4
State University where she studied aerosol physics 
5
and earned an M.S. in Applied Mathematics. 
6
(10) Dr. Christine Darden began her career in 
7
aeronautics in 1967 as a data analyst at NASA’s 
8
Langley Research Center (referred to in this section 
9
as ‘‘Langley’’) before being promoted to aerospace 
10
engineer in 1973. Her work in this position resulted 
11
in the production of low-boom sonic effects, which 
12
revolutionized aerodynamics design. 
13
(11) Dr. Christine Darden completed her edu-
14
cation by earning a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineer-
15
ing from George Washington University in 1983. 
16
(12) While working at NASA, Dr. Christine 
17
Darden— 
18
(A) was appointed to be the leader of the 
19
Sonic Boom Team, which worked on designs to 
20
minimize the effects of sonic booms by testing 
21
wing and nose designs for supersonic aircraft; 
22
(B) wrote more than 50 articles on aero-
23
nautics design; and

(C) became the first African American to 
1
be promoted to a position in the Senior Execu-
2
tive Service at Langley. 
3
(13) Dorothy Vaughan was born on September 
4
20, 1910, in Kansas City, Missouri. 
5
(14) Dorothy Vaughan began working for 
6
NACA in 1943. Dorothy Vaughan— 
7
(A) started at NACA as a member of the 
8
West Area Computing unit; 
9
(B) was promoted to be the head of the 
10
West Area Computing unit, becoming NACA’s 
11
first African-American supervisor, a position 
12
that she held for 9 years; and 
13
(C) became an expert programmer in 
14
FORTRAN as a member of NASA’s Analysis 
15
and Computation Division. 
16
(15) Dorothy Vaughan retired from NASA in 
17
1971 and died on November 10, 2008. 
18
(16) Mary Jackson was born on April 9, 1921, 
19
in Hampton, Virginia. 
20
(17) Mary Jackson started her career at NACA 
21
in 1951, working as a computer as a member of the 
22
West Area Computing unit. 
23
(18) After petitioning the City of Hampton to 
24
allow her to take graduate-level courses in math and

physics at night at the all-White Hampton High 
1
School, Mary Jackson was able to complete the re-
2
quired training to become an engineer, making her 
3
NASA’s first female African-American engineer. 
4
(19) Mary Jackson— 
5
(A) while at NACA and NASA— 
6
(i) worked in the Theoretical Aero-
7
dynamics Branch of the Subsonic-Tran-
8
sonic Aerodynamics Division at Langley 
9
where she analyzed wind tunnel and air-
10
craft flight data; and 
11
(ii) published a dozen technical papers 
12
that focused on the boundary layer of air 
13
around airplanes; and 
14
(B) after 21 years working as an engineer 
15
at NASA, transitioned to a new job as 
16
Langley’s Federal Women’s Program Manager 
17
where she worked to improve the prospects of 
18
NASA’s female mathematicians, engineers, and 
19
scientists. 
20
(20) Mary Jackson retired from NASA in 1985 
21
and died in 2005. 
22
(21) These 4 women, along with the other Afri-
23
can-American women in NASA’s West Area Com-
24
puting unit, were integral to the success of the early

space program. The stories of these 4 women exem-
1
plify the experiences of hundreds of women who 
2
worked as computers, mathematicians, and engi-
3
neers at NACA beginning in the 1930s and their 
4
handmade calculations played an integral role in— 
5
(A) aircraft testing during World War II; 
6
(B) supersonic flight research; 
7
(C) sending the Voyager probes to explore 
8
the solar system; and
