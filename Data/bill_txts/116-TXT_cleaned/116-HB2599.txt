SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Suicide and Threat 
2
Assessment Nationally Dedicated to Universal Prevention 
3
Act of 2019’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
5
The Congress finds as follows: 
6
(1) Since 2010, suicide has been the second- 
7
leading cause of death for young people ages 10–24. 
8
In 2016, 6,159 young people ages 10–24 completed 
9
suicide. 
10
(2) Based on the 2017 Youth Risk Behavior 
11
Survey of the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
12
vention (in this section referred to as ‘‘CDC’’), 7.4 
13
percent of youth in grades 9–12 reported that they 
14
made at least one suicide attempt in the past 12 
15
months. 
16
(3) While there is no complete count of suicide 
17
attempts in the United States, CDC data suggests 
18
that for every reported suicide death, approximately 
19
11.4 people visit a hospital for self-harm-related in-
20
juries. 
21
(4) In 2016, suicide was the 10th-leading cause 
22
of death overall in the United States, with over 
23
44,000 people completing suicide, and there were 
24
more than twice as many suicides in the United 
25
States as there were homicides.

•HR 2599 IH
(5) Youth often display warning signs and sig-
1
nals before harming themselves or others. Research 
2
shows that 70 percent of those who complete suicide 
3
tell someone of their plans or give another warning 
4
sign, and 80 percent of school shooters tell someone 
5
of their plans. 
6
(6) According to the CDC, the rates of suicide 
7
among American Indians and Alaska Natives have 
8
been increasing since 2003 and are the highest of 
9
any racial or ethnic group in the United States. In 
10
addition, recent studies of CDC data from 2001 
11
through 2015 show that suicide rates for Black chil-
12
dren aged 5 through 12 were roughly two times 
13
higher than those of similarly aged White children. 
14
(7) Research has shown that evidence-based 
15
school threat assessment teams reduce suicide; inter-
16
personal violence, bullying, and aggression; school 
17
staff anxiety about violence; and expulsion and sus-
18
pension rates. Evidence-based school threat assess-
19
ment teams have been shown to increase the willing-
20
ness of students to seek help for threats of violence 
21
and mental illness, use of school counseling, and pa-
22
rental involvement. 
23
(8) Research has shown that evidence-based 
24
school threat assessment teams can lead to a reduc-
25

tion in racial disparities between White, Black, and 
1
Hispanic students in school disciplinary outcomes 
2
and legal actions. Additionally, research shows that 
3
evidence-based school threat assessment teams can 
4
help combat the school-to-prison pipeline.
