SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Wage theft occurs when an employer does 
3
not pay an employee for work that the employee has 
4
performed, depriving the worker of wages and earn-
5
ings to which the worker is legally entitled. This 
6
theft occurs in many forms, including by employers 
7
violating minimum wage requirements, failing to pay 
8
overtime compensation, requiring off-the-clock work, 
9
failing to provide final payments, misclassifying em-
10
ployees as being exempt from overtime compensation 
11
or as independent contractors rather than as em-
12
ployees, and improperly withholding tips. 
13
(2) Wage theft poses a serious and growing 
14
problem across industries for working individuals of 
15
the United States. Wage theft is widespread and is 
16
estimated 
to 
cost 
workers 
more 
than 
17
$15,000,000,000 per year. In certain industries, 
18
compliance with Federal wage and hour laws is less 
19
than 50 percent. 
20
(3) Wage theft is closely associated with em-
21
ployment discrimination, with women, immigrants, 
22
and minorities being disproportionately affected. 
23
Women are significantly more likely to experience 
24
minimum wage violations than men, foreign-born 
25
workers are nearly 2 times as likely to experience 
26
23:13 Jul 15, 2019
H3712
3 
•HR 3712 IH
minimum wage violations as their counterparts born 
1
in the United States, and African Americans are 3 
2
times more likely to experience minimum wage viola-
3
tions than their White counterparts. 
4
(4) Wage theft is closely associated with unsafe 
5
working conditions. 
6
(5) Wage theft— 
7
(A) depresses the wages of working fami-
8
lies who are already struggling to make ends 
9
meet; 
10
(B) strains social services funds; 
11
(C) diminishes consumer spending power 
12
and hurts local economies; 
13
(D) reduces vital State and Federal tax 
14
revenues; 
15
(E) places law-abiding employers at a com-
16
petitive disadvantage with noncompliant em-
17
ployers; 
18
(F) burdens commerce and the free flow of 
19
goods; and 
20
(G) lowers labor standards throughout 
21
labor markets. 
22
(6) Low-wage workers are at the greatest risk 
23
of suffering from wage theft. A survey of 4,387 low- 
24
wage workers in New York, Los Angeles, and Chi-
25
23:13 Jul 15, 2019
H3712
4 
•HR 3712 IH
cago found that 68 percent of the workers surveyed 
1
had experienced some form of wage theft in the 
2
workweek immediately before the survey was con-
3
ducted. These workers experienced a range of wage 
4
and hour violations: 26 percent of such workers were 
5
not paid minimum wage; 76 percent of such workers 
6
who worked more than 40 hours in the workweek 
7
immediately before the survey was conducted were 
8
not paid at the overtime rate; and, in the year before 
9
the survey was conducted, 43 percent of the workers 
10
who attempted to address such issues by filing a 
11
complaint with their employer or who attempted to 
12
form a labor organization experienced retaliation by 
13
their employers, including by being fired, suspended, 
14
or receiving threats of reductions in their hours or 
15
pay. 
16
(7) In 2012, State and Federal authorities as 
17
well as private attorneys recovered at least 
18
$933,000,000 in wage theft enforcement actions, 
19
which was nearly 3 times the value of all bank rob-
20
beries, residential robberies, convenience store and 
21
gas station robberies, and street robberies in the 
22
United States during that year. 
23
(8) A Department of Labor study of wage theft 
24
in California and New York found that wage theft 
25
23:13 Jul 15, 2019
H3712
5 
•HR 3712 IH
deprived workers of 37 percent to 49 percent of 
1
their income, pushing at least 15,000 families below 
2
the poverty line and driving another 50,000 to 
3
100,000 families deeper into poverty. 
4
(9) A study analyzing wage theft claims in the 
5
State of Washington from 2009 to 2013 estimated 
6
that the total economic cost of wage theft to the 
7
State totaled more than $64,000,000 resulting from 
8
the lower economic activity and spending of low- 
9
wage workers due to their lost wages. 
10
(10) A Department of Labor study of wage vio-
11
lations in California and New York found that wage 
12
theft deprived families of $5,600,000 in possible 
13
earned income tax credits and resulted in a 
14
$22,000,000 
loss 
in 
State 
tax 
revenue, 
a 
15
$238,000,000 loss in payroll tax revenue, and a 
16
$113,000,000 loss in Federal income tax revenue. 
17
(11) Barriers to addressing wage theft continue 
18
to exist decades after the enactment of the Fair 
19
Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 201 et 
20
seq.). These barriers have resulted, in significant 
21
part, because enforcement of such Act has not 
22
worked as Congress originally intended and because 
23
many of the provisions of such Act do not include 
24
sufficient penalties to discourage violations. Improve-
25
23:13 Jul 15, 2019
H3712
6 
•HR 3712 IH
ments to enforcement and amendments to such Act 
1
are necessary to ensure that such Act provides effec-
2
tive protection to individuals subject to wage theft. 
3
(12) The lack of a Federal right for employees 
4
to receive full compensation at the agreed upon wage 
5
rate for all work performed by the employee has re-
6
sulted in workers being able to recover only the ap-
7
plicable minimum wage, or the overtime rate if ap-
8
plicable, when employers engage in wage theft. 
9
(13) The lack of a Federal requirement to pro-
10
vide employees with paystubs indicating how their 
11
pay is calculated or to allow employees to inspect 
12
their employers’ payroll records significantly impedes 
13
efforts to identify and challenge wage theft. 
14
(14) The lack of a Federal requirement to pay 
15
employees their final payments in a timely manner 
16
upon termination of the employment relationship be-
17
tween the employer and employee has led to unrea-
18
sonable, and sometimes indefinite, delays in com-
19
pensation after an employment relationship ends. 
20
(15) While the Fair Labor Standards Act of 
21
1938, and regulations promulgated by the Secretary 
22
of Labor, as in effect on the day before the date of 
23
enactment of this Act, require employers to com-
24
pensate employees at the minimum wage rate and to 
25
23:13 Jul 15, 2019
H3712
7 
•HR 3712 IH
provide overtime compensation when appropriate, 
1
the lack of civil penalties for violations of these re-
2
quirements has dampened their effectiveness. 
3
(16) While the Fair Labor Standards Act of 
4
1938 and regulations promulgated by the Secretary 
5
of Labor, as in effect on the day before the date of 
6
enactment of this Act, provide employees who are 
7
subject to wage theft with the right to unpaid min-
8
imum wages or unpaid overtime compensation plus 
9
an additional equal amount as liquidated damages, 
10
this low level of damages has proved insufficient to 
11
deter employers from stealing the wages of their em-
12
ployees. 
13
(17) While the Fair Labor Standards Act of 
14
1938 and regulations promulgated by the Secretary 
15
of Labor, as in effect on the day before the date of 
16
enactment of this Act, require employers to keep 
17
records of employees’ pay, the lack of remedies for 
18
this requirement diminishes the effectiveness of the 
19
requirement. 
20
(18) While the Fair Labor Standards Act of 
21
1938 and regulations promulgated by the Secretary 
22
of Labor, as in effect on the day before the date of 
23
enactment of this Act, provide for limited criminal 
24
penalties when employers violate the provisions of 
25
23:13 Jul 15, 2019
H3712
8 
•HR 3712 IH
such Act, the Secretary of Labor rarely resorts to 
1
these penalties, causing them to serve as a hollow 
2
threat. 
3
(19) The statute of limitations under section 6 
4
of the Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947 (29 U.S.C. 255), 
5
in effect on the day before the date of enactment of 
6
this Act, precludes employees from bringing claims 
7
for wage theft 2 years after the cause of action ac-
8
crued, or 3 years after the cause of action accrued 
9
if the claim is with respect to a willful violation by 
10
the employer. Additionally, the statute of limitations 
11
is not suspended while the Secretary of Labor inves-
12
tigates a complaint. These strict confines of the stat-
13
ute of limitations sometimes result in employees 
14
being deprived of their ability to institute a private 
15
lawsuit against their employer in order to recover 
16
their stolen wages. 
17
(20) Section 16(b) of the Fair Labor Standards 
18
Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 216(b)), as in effect on the 
19
day before the date of enactment of this Act, re-
20
quires employees to affirmatively ‘‘opt-in’’ in order 
21
to be a party plaintiff in a collective action brought 
22
by another aggrieved employee seeking to recover 
23
stolen wages in court. This provision limits the abil-
24
23:13 Jul 15, 2019
H3712
9 
•HR 3712 IH
ity of employees to unite and pursue private lawsuits 
1
against employers. 
2
(21) Under the penalty structure of the Fair 
3
Labor Standards Act of 1938, as in effect on the 
4
day before the date of enactment of this Act, many 
5
employers who are caught violating such Act con-
6
tinue to violate the Act. A Department of Labor in-
7
vestigation found that one-third of employers who 
8
had previously engaged in wage theft continued to 
9
do so. 
10
(22) The Government Accountability Office and 
11
the Department of Labor have recognized that when 
12
employers are assessed civil penalties, they are more 
13
likely to comply with the law in the future and other 
14
employers in the same region—regardless of indus-
15
try—are also more likely to comply with the law. 
16
(23) States that have enacted legislation to ad-
17
dress wage theft by increasing the damages to which 
18
employees are entitled following violations of wage 
19
and hour laws have positively impacted the workers 
20
in such States. However, many States have not en-
21
acted such legislation and, worse still, some States 
22
do not have any laws protecting workers from wage 
23
theft or even agencies to enforce workers’ rights to 
24
compensation for work. This discrepancy in State 
25
23:13 Jul 15, 2019
H3712
10 
•HR 3712 IH
laws has resulted in a fragmentation of workers’ 
1
rights across the United States, with some workers 
2
having a measure of protection from wage theft and 
3
other workers being left extremely vulnerable to 
4
wage theft. 
5
(24) Effective enforcement of wage and hour 
6
laws is critical to increasing compliance. Given the 
7
limited resources available for enforcement, en-
8
hanced strategic enforcement of Federal wage and 
9
hour laws is crucial. 
10
(25) For enhanced strategic enforcement to be 
11
effective, government regulators must work with 
12
community stakeholders who have direct knowledge 
13
of ongoing violations of Federal wage and hour re-
14
quirements and who are in a position to prevent 
15
such violations. 
16
(26) Partnerships between regulators, workers, 
17
nonprofit organizations, and businesses can increase 
18
compliance by educating workers about their rights, 
19
collecting evidence, reporting violations, identifying 
20
noncompliant employers, and modeling good prac-
21
tices. 
22
(27) Partnerships between regulators, workers, 
23
nonprofit organizations, and businesses have been 
24
successful in combating wage theft. In 2006, the Di-
25

vision of Labor Standards Enforcement of the State 
1
of California created a janitorial enforcement team 
2
to work closely with a local janitorial watchdog orga-
3
nization. As of 2015, the partnership had resulted in 
4
countless administrative, civil, and criminal actions 
5
against employers and in the collection of more than 
6
$68,000,000 in back pay for janitorial workers. 
7
(28) The Comptroller General of the United 
8
States has recommended that the Department of 
9
Labor identify ways to leverage its resources to bet-
10
ter combat wage theft by improving services pro-
11
vided through partnerships.
