A BILL 
To provide for a grants program to develop and enhance 
integrated nutrition and physical activity curricula in 
medical schools. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Expanding Nutrition’s

Role in Curricula and Healthcare Act’’ or the ‘‘ENRICH

Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
7
Congress finds the following: 
8
(1) In 2012, United States health care spend-
9
ing was about $8,915 per resident and accounted for 
10

•HR 1888 IH
17.2 percent of the Nation’s gross domestic product, 
1
which is among the highest of all industrialized 
2
countries. 
3
(2) Expenditures in the United States on health 
4
care surpassed $2.3 trillion in 2008, more than 
5
three times the $714 billion spent in 1990, and over 
6
eight times the $253 billion spent in 1980. Cardio-
7
vascular disease cost American’s $555 billion in 
8
2016 alone. 
9
(3) It is estimated that health care costs for 
10
chronic disease treatment account for over 75 per-
11
cent of national health expenditures. 
12
(4) In March 2003, a report from the World 
13
Health Organization concluded diet was a major fac-
14
tor in the cause of chronic diseases. 
15
(5) Seven out of 10 deaths among Americans 
16
each year are from chronic diseases. Heart disease, 
17
cancer, and stroke—each of which has been strongly 
18
linked to dietary and lifestyle choices—account for 
19
more than 50 percent of all deaths each year. 
20
(6) In 2015, 102.7 million people in the United 
21
States had at least one form of cardiovascular dis-
22
ease. Approximately 2,300 Americans die every day 
23
from cardiovascular disease. In 2010, cardiovascular 
24
disease cost American taxpayers $189.4 billion. The 
25

•HR 1888 IH
American Heart Association estimates that, by 
1
2035, costs related to cardiovascular disease will tri-
2
ple to around $1.1 trillion. Research has shown that 
3
following a healthful diet can not only reduce symp-
4
toms related to heart disease but also reverse the 
5
damage done to the arteries. 
6
(7) Two-thirds of the American population is 
7
currently overweight, half of whom are obese. One in 
8
three children is now overweight, and one-fifth of 
9
children are obese. In 2008, the United States spent 
10
$190 billion on obesity-related health care costs. 
11
(8) An estimated 29 million Americans have di-
12
abetes. Another 86 million adults have prediabetes. 
13
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention pre-
14
dict that one in three children born in 2000 will de-
15
velop diabetes at some point in their lives. Diabetes 
16
cost the government $116 billion in 2007. Research 
17
has shown that nutrition therapy is a key component 
18
of diabetes management and can improve clinical 
19
outcomes. 
20
(9) Cancer kills approximately 570,000 Ameri-
21
cans each year, accounting for one in every four 
22
deaths. More than 1.5 million new cancer cases are 
23
diagnosed annually. In 2010, the direct costs of can-
24
cer were $102.8 billion and that number is expected 
25
21:50 Apr 06, 2019
H1888

•HR 1888 IH
to rise to $172 billion by 2020. More than 33 per-
1
cent of cancers are diet related and could be pre-
2
vented with a healthful diet. 
3
(10) Eating is a complex social phenomenon in-
4
fluenced by family, social networks, culture, socio-
5
economic and educational status. An interprofes-
6
sional approach to nutrition education for clinicians 
7
may not necessarily overcome these forces but may 
8
help the health professions team, including physi-
9
cians and non-physicians, identify effective strategies 
10
for nutrition counseling and management. 
11
(11) Physicians are an important source of in-
12
formation and motivation for patients’ health behav-
13
ior. Multiple studies have shown that physician 
14
counseling on weight loss increases the likelihood 
15
that patients will attempt weight loss, increase phys-
16
ical activity, improve diet, and lose weight. 
17
(12) Leading medical bodies recommend that 
18
physicians address diet with overweight patients. 
19
Guidelines from leading medical bodies such as the 
20
National Institutes of Health, the American Heart 
21
Association, the American College of Cardiology, and 
22
the Obesity Society recommend that physicians 
23
counsel overweight and obese patients on the bene-
