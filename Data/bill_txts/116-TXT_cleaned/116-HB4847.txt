•HR 4847 IH
(1) Of all foreign assistance provided by the 
1
United States, global health appropriations are sec-
2
ond only to security assistance. 
3
(2) Several Federal agencies and departments 
4
execute global health activities, including the United 
5
States Agency for International Development, the 
6
Department of Health and Human Services, the De-
7
partment of Defense, the Department of Agriculture, 
8
and the Department of State. 
9
(3) Global health assistance provided by the 
10
United States supports— 
11
(A) activities carried out by numerous pri-
12
vate, corporate, and nongovernmental organiza-
13
tions worldwide; and 
14
(B) multilateral organizations, such as the 
15
Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and 
16
Malaria and the World Health Organization. 
17
(4) The United States provides foreign assist-
18
ance to achieve national security, commercial, and 
19
humanitarian objectives while demonstrating global 
20
leadership. 
21

22
programs, regardless of the implementing agency, 
23
support the objectives referred to in paragraph (4),

•HR 4847 IH
but the manner in which the programs achieve the 
1
objectives varies widely. 
2
(6) The approach for global health assistance 
3
provided by the United States is largely program- 
4
based or disease-based and often does not allow 
5
agencies to work across the health system or on 
6
issues of greatest concern to the host country. 
7
(7) Such an approach hampers long-term sta-
8
bility, diplomacy with key partnerships, and sustain-
9
able capacity building. 
10
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
11
gress that— 
12
(1) each global health implementing agency 
13
should establish a program for the development of a 
14
cadre of health advisors who can serve as United 
15
States global health attache´s; 
16
(2) country or regional health teams and health 
17
development partners working groups should be es-
18
tablished in all countries with significant United 
19
States health investments; and 
20
(3) all global health activities supported by the 
21
United States Government should be implemented in 
22
a coordinated manner.
