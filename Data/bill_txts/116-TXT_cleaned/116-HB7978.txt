SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds that— 
2
(1) in 2017 and 2018, the State of California, 
3
the State of Montana, and other Western States ex-
4
perienced some of the deadliest and most destructive 
5
wildfires in the last 100 years, devastating Federal, 
6
State, and private land, destroying tens of thousands 
7
of homes, killing dozens of people, and burning large 
8
areas of land in the wildland-urban interface (as de-
9
fined in section 101 of the Healthy Forests Restora-
10
tion Act of 2003 (16 U.S.C. 6511)); 
11
(2) fire suppression practices over several dec-
12
ades, inadequate levels of forest management, and

1
and, according to the Fourth National Climate As-
2
sessment by the United States Global Change Re-
3
search Program, the cumulative number of acres 
4
burned in the period from 1984 to 2015 was twice 
5
the number of acres that would have burned in the 
6
absence of climate change; 
7
(3) increased development in the wildland-urban 
8
interface near overgrown forest landscapes has in-
9
creased the number of people living in areas that are 
10
at risk of wildfire; 
11
(4) despite legislation enacted over the last 20 
12
years to facilitate hazardous fuels reduction, certain 
13
statutory, regulatory, and administrative require-
14
ments, including studies, publication periods, season- 
15
specific surveys, and objection processes, and litiga-
16
tion can significantly impede rapid implementation 
17
of hazardous fuels reduction projects necessary to 
18
protect lives and property; 
19
(5) increasing the pace and scale of science- 
20
based, publicly developed forest management activi-
21
ties that reduce hazardous fuels, including through 
22
mechanical thinning and controlled burning, can re-

5
est System land in the State of California and 
6
6,300,000 acres of National Forest System land in 
7
the State of Montana were at high or very high wild-
8
fire hazard potential, of which 3,100,000 acres and 
9
1,600,000 acres, respectively, were within proximity 
10
to populated areas; and 
11
(7) the Governor of the State of California has 
12
proclaimed a ‘‘State of Emergency’’ due to a vast 
13
tree die-off throughout the State that has increased 
14
the risk of wildfires and has created extremely dan-
15
gerous fire conditions.
