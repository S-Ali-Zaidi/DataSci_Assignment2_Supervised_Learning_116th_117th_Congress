A BILL 
To prohibit discrimination on the basis of religion, sex (in-
cluding sexual orientation and gender identity), and mar-
ital status in the administration and provision of child 
welfare services; to improve safety, well-being, and per-
manency for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and 
queer/questioning foster youth; and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Every Child Deserves 
2
a Family Act’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. 
4
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) Every child or youth unable to live with 
6
their family of origin is entitled to a supportive and 
7
affirming foster care placement. Federal law re-
8
quires, and child welfare experts recommend, that 
9
children and youth be placed with a family or in the 
10
most family-like setting available. 
11
(2) Thousands of children and youth lack a sta-
12
ble, safe, and loving temporary or permanent home 
13
and have been placed in a congregate care setting, 
14
which is associated with more placements, poorer 
15
educational outcomes, and greater risk of further 
16
trauma. More homes are needed to accommodate the 
17
growing number of children and youth involved with 
18
child welfare services. 
19
(3) In 2017, there were an estimated 443,000 
20
children and youth in the United States foster care 
21
system, and 123,000 were eligible and waiting to be 
22
adopted. Tragically, approximately 20,000 ‘‘aged 
23
out’’ of the child welfare system without a forever 
24
family, placing them at higher risk of negative out-
25

•HR 3114 IH
comes including poverty, homelessness, incarcer-
1
ation, and early parenthood. 
2
(4) Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 
3
U.S.C. 2000d et seq.) protects people from discrimi-
4
nation based on race, color, or national origin in 
5
programs, activities, and services administered or 
6
performed by child welfare agencies. Eliminating dis-
7
crimination in child welfare based on religion, sex 
8
(including sexual orientation and gender identity), 
9
and marital status would increase the number and 
10
diversity of foster and adoptive homes able to meet 
11
the individual needs of children and youth removed 
12
from their homes. 
13
(5) Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and 
14
queer/questioning (referred to in this Act as 
15
‘‘LGBTQ’’) youth are overrepresented in the foster 
16
care system by at least a factor of 2, comprising at 
17
least 22 to 30 percent of children and youth in fos-
18
ter care. 
19
(A) While some LGBTQ youth enter foster 
20
care for similar reasons as non-LGBTQ youth, 
21
the two most common reasons for LGBTQ 
22
youth are high rates of physical abuse and con-
23
flict with parents. 
24
05:11 Jun 12, 2019
H3114

•HR 3114 IH
(B) LGBTQ foster youth report twice the 
1
rate of poor treatment while in care experienced 
2
by foster youth who do not identify as LGBTQ 
3
and are more likely to experience discrimina-
4
tion, harassment, and violence in the child wel-
5
fare system than their LGBTQ peers not in the 
6
child welfare system. 
7
(C) Because of high levels of bias, LGBTQ 
8
foster youth have a higher average number of 
9
placements and higher likelihood of living in a 
10
group home than their non-LGBTQ peers, neg-
11
atively affecting mental health outcomes and 
12
long-term prospects. 
13
(D) Approximately 60 percent of homeless 
14
LGBTQ youth were previously in foster care, 
15
and many reported that living on the streets 
16
felt safer than living in a group or foster home. 
17
(6) ‘‘Conversion therapy’’ is a form of discrimi-
18
nation that harms LGBTQ people. It undermines an 
19
individual’s sense of self-worth, increases suicide ide-
20
ation and substance abuse, exacerbates family con-
21
flict, and contributes to second-class status. No sci-
22
entifically valid evidence supports this discredited 
23
practice, which is prohibited by many States and 
24
foreign nations. Approximately 350,000 LGBTQ 
25
05:11 Jun 12, 2019
H3114
5 
•HR 3114 IH
adults were subjected to so-called ‘‘conversion ther-
1
apy’’ as adolescents, and an estimated 20,000 
2
LGBTQ youth ages 13 to 17 will be subjected to it 
3
by a licensed health care professional before age 18. 
4
(7) Many youth, especially LGBTQ youth, in-
5
volved with child welfare services identify with a 
6
cross-section of marginalized communities. Youth of 
7
color are overrepresented in the foster care system, 
8
and the majority of LGBTQ foster youth are youth 
9
of color. Children and youth with multiple margina-
10
lized identities often experience more stress and 
11
trauma than other youth, compounding the negative 
12
effects of discrimination and increasing the likeli-
13
hood of negative outcomes. 
14
(8) Prospective parents who experience the 
15
heartbreak and dignitary harm of discrimination 
16
based on religion, sex (including sexual orientation 
17
and gender identity), or marital status may not be 
18
able or willing to apply at another agency, resulting 
19
in fewer available homes, and knowing that discrimi-
20
nation exists may deter them from even attempting 
21
to foster or adopt. 
22
(9) Professional organizations that serve chil-
23
dren in the fields of medicine, psychology, law, and 
24
05:11 Jun 12, 2019
H3114
6 
•HR 3114 IH
child welfare oppose discrimination against prospec-
1
tive parents in adoption and foster care. 
2
(10) Religious organizations play a critical role 
3
in providing child welfare services. Most welcome all 
4
children, youth, and families and affirm a diversity 
5
of religions and faiths. State assessments, planning, 
6
and counseling should connect children and youth 
7
for whom spirituality and religion are important 
8
with affirming, faith-based resources consistent with 
9
the faith of the child or youth. 
10
(11) Child welfare agencies that refuse to serve 
11
same-sex couples and LGBTQ individuals reduce the 
12
pool of qualified and available homes for children 
13
and youth who need placement on a temporary or 
14
permanent basis. 
15
(A) Same-sex couples are 7 times more 
16
likely to foster and adopt than their different- 
17
sex counterparts. 
18
(B) Same-sex couples raising adopted chil-
19
dren tend to be older than, just as educated as, 
20
and have access to the same economic resources 
21
as other adoptive parents. 
22
(C) Research shows that sexual orientation 
23
is a nondeterminative factor in parental success 
24
and that children with same-sex parents have 
25
05:11 Jun 12, 2019
H3114
7 
•HR 3114 IH
the same advantages and expectations for 
1
health, social, and psychological development as 
2
children whose parents are different-sex. 
3
(D) Discrimination against qualified pro-
4
spective foster and adoptive parents for non- 
5
merit related reasons denies religious minority, 
6
LGBTQ, and unmarried relatives the oppor-
7
tunity to become foster and adoptive parents 
8
for their own kin in care, including grand-
9
children. 
10
(12) LGBTQ families of origin are at risk for 
11
discrimination in child welfare referrals, investiga-
12
tions, removals, reunification, kinship placements, 
13
and other case management services. A study of low- 
14
income African-American mothers showed that those 
15
who identified as lesbian or bisexual were four times 
16
more likely than their non-LGBTQ counterparts to 
17
lose custody of their children in child welfare pro-
18
ceedings. LGBTQ-positive services are necessary to 
19
shield families and protect parents’ rights to reunifi-
20
cation. 
21
(13) Single people are more likely than couples 
22
to experience challenges in adopting due to biases 
23
that persist against single-parent adoption. In 2017, 
24
28 percent of adoptions from foster care were com-
25
05:11 Jun 12, 2019
H3114
8 
•HR 3114 IH
pleted by unmarried single people, including adop-
1
tions from almost 2,000 single men and over 14,800 
2
single women. Studies show that the outcomes for 
3
children adopted and raised by single parents are 
4
just as good as, if not better than, outcomes for chil-
5
dren adopted by couples. 
6
(14) More nationwide data about the experi-
7
ences of LGBTQ children and youth involved with 
8
child welfare services is needed to understand fully 
9
the extent and impact of discrimination and ensure 
10
accountability. States must report and researchers 
11
must collect this sensitive data in an ethical, affirm-
12
ing, and non-intrusive manner, with appropriate 
13
safeguards to protect respondents. 
14
(b) PURPOSE.—The purposes of this Act are— 
15
(1) to prohibit discrimination on the basis of re-
16
ligion, sex (including sexual orientation and gender 
17
identity), and marital status in the administration 
18
and provision of child welfare services that receive 
19
Federal funds; and

(2) to improve safety, well-being, and perma-
21
