RESOLUTION 
Keeping guns out of classrooms. 
Whereas Congress has consistently made clear that it is un-
lawful for Federal funds to be used for training or arm-
ing school personnel with firearms; 
Whereas Congress passed the STOP School Violence Act of 
2018 (title V of division S of Public Law 115–141) in 
response to the shooting in Parkland, Florida, and 
amended part AA of title I of the Omnibus Crime Con-
trol and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (34 U.S.C. 10551 et 
seq.) to specify that ‘‘No amounts provided as a grant 
[for school security under such part] may be used for the 
provision to any person of a firearm or training in the 
use of a firearm.’’;

Whereas section 4102 of the Elementary and Secondary Edu-
cation Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 7113), as added by section 
4101 of the Every Student Succeeds Act (Public Law 
114–95; 129 Stat. 1970), defines drug and violence pre-
vention in schools as including the ‘‘creation . . . of a 
school environment that is free of weapons’’; 
Whereas existing research demonstrates that training or arm-
ing school personnel with firearms will not make schools 
safer; 
Whereas an analysis by the Federal Bureau of Investigation 
of active shooters between 2000 and 2013 found that 
trained law enforcement suffered casualties in 21 of the 
45 incidents in which officers engaged the shooter to end 
the threat; 
Whereas a survey of gun violence on school campuses showed 
that out of 225 incidents of gun violence between 1999 
and 2018, trained armed personnel or school resource of-
ficers failed to disarm an active shooter 223 times; 
Whereas proposed and existing programs to train or arm 
school personnel with firearms require significantly less 
training than law enforcement officers receive; 
Whereas research demonstrates that increased gun access 
and possession are not associated with protection from vi-
olence and a greater prevalence of guns increases the 
likelihood of gun violence; 
Whereas a greater prevalence of guns in schools creates 
undue risk of students gaining unauthorized access to 
firearms and the potential for unintentional shootings 
and school staff using guns in situations that do not war-
rant lethal force;

•HRES 231 IH 
Whereas students of color, students with disabilities, and 
other vulnerable groups would experience a disparate im-
pact of programs that arm school personnel as those stu-
dents are disproportionately disciplined and arrested; 
Whereas heightened policing within public school spaces de-
creases a student’s sense of safety and the associated an-
ticipation of violence leads to increased anxiety, fear, and 
depression; 
Whereas 73 percent of teachers in the United States do not 
want to carry guns in school and 58 percent say arming 
personnel would make schools less safe, according to a 
Gallup poll from March 2018; 
Whereas the majority of parents of school-aged children op-
pose arming school personnel, according to surveys; 
Whereas, as of March 2019, there is no evidence supporting 
the value of arming school personnel; 
Whereas the broad consensus among participants in the lis-
tening tour for the final report of the Federal Commis-
sion on School Safety released in December 2018 was 
disagreement with programs that would arm school per-
sonnel, according to transcripts; and 
Whereas, in that final report, the Department of Education 
endorsed the use of Federal funds to train personnel to 
use firearms: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-
1
resentatives that Federal funds shall not be used to train 
2
or arm school personnel with firearms.
