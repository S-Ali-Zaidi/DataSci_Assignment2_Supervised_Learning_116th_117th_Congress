SEC. 2. LIMITATION ON USE OF FUNDS TO REDUCE DE-
1
PLOYMENT TO AFGHANISTAN. 
2
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
3
gress that— 
4
(1) it is in the national security interests of the 
5
United States to deny terrorists safe haven in Af-
6
ghanistan, protect the United States homeland, up-
7
hold the United States partnership with the Govern-
8
ment of Afghanistan and cooperation with the Af-
9
ghan National Defense and Security Forces, and 
10
protect the hard-fought rights of women, girls, and 
11
other vulnerable populations in Afghanistan; 
12
(2) a rapid military drawdown and a lack of 
13
United States commitment to the security and sta-
14
bility of Afghanistan would undermine diplomatic ef-
15
forts for peace; 
16
(3) the current agreement between the United 
17
States and the Taliban does not provide for the ap-
18
propriate protections for vulnerable populations, 
19
does not create conditions for the rejection of vio-
20
lence and prevention of terrorist safe havens, and 
21
does not represent a realistic diplomatic solution, 
22
based on verifiable facts and conditions on the 
23
ground, that provides for long-term stability; and 
24
(4) the Administration has a constitutional obli-
25
gation to provide Congress with timely and com-
26

9
gated or expended for any activity having either of the
