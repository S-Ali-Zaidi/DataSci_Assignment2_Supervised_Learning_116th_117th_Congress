RESOLUTION 
Recognizing September 2020 as National Ovarian Cancer 
Awareness Month. 
Whereas ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer 
deaths of women in the United States and accounts for 
more deaths than any other cancer of the female repro-
ductive system; 
Whereas in the United States, a women’s lifetime risk of 
being diagnosed with ovarian cancer is about 1 in 78; 
Whereas the American Cancer Society estimates 21,750 new 
cases of ovarian cancer will be diagnosed in 2020 and 
13,940 people will die from the disease nationwide; 
Whereas the five-year survival rate for ovarian cancer is 46.5 
percent and survival rates vary greatly depending on the 
stage of diagnosis;

Whereas the five-year survival rate for ovarian cancer is over 
90 percent for women diagnosed in early stages; 
Whereas while the mammogram can detect breast cancer and 
the Pap smear can detect cervical cancer, there is no reli-
able early detection test for ovarian cancer; 
Whereas, in June 2007, the first national consensus state-
ment on ovarian cancer symptoms was developed to pro-
vide consistency in describing symptoms to make it easier 
for women to learn and remember those symptoms; 
Whereas too many people remain unaware that the symptoms 
of ovarian cancer often include bloating, pelvic or abdom-
inal pain, difficulty eating or feeling full quickly, urinary 
symptoms, and several other vague symptoms that are 
often easily confused with other diseases; 
Whereas improved awareness of the symptoms of ovarian 
cancer by the pubic and health care providers can lead 
to a quicker diagnosis; 
Whereas the lack of an early detection test for ovarian cancer 
combined with its vague symptoms mean that approxi-
mately 80 percent of cases of ovarian cancer are detected 
at an advanced stage; 
Whereas all women are at risk for ovarian cancer, but ap-
proximately 20 percent of women who are diagnosed with 
ovarian cancer have a hereditary predisposition to ovar-
ian cancer, which places them at even higher risk; 
Whereas scientists and physicians have uncovered changes in 
the BRCA genes that some women inherit from their 
parents, which may make those women 30 times more 
likely to develop ovarian cancer; 
Whereas the family history of a woman has been found to 
play an important role in accurately assessing their risk

of developing ovarian cancer and medical experts believe 
that family history should be taken into consideration 
during the annual well-woman visit of any woman; 
Whereas women who know that they are at high risk of ovar-
ian cancer may undertake prophylactic measures to help 
reduce the risk of developing this disease; 
Whereas guidelines issued by the National Comprehensive 
Cancer Network and Society of Gynecologic Oncology 
recommend that all individuals diagnosed with ovarian 
cancer receive genetic counseling and genetic testing re-
gardless of their family history; 
Whereas studies consistently show that compliance with these 
guidelines is alarmingly low, with recently published Na-
tional Cancer Institute-funded research finding that in 
2013 and 2014, only one-third of ovarian cancer sur-
vivors have undergone such testing; 
Whereas according to a 2016 consensus report by the Na-
tional Academy of Medicine, ‘‘there remain surprising 
gaps in the fundamental knowledge about and under-
standing of ovarian cancer’’ across all aspects of the dis-
ease; 
Whereas ongoing investments in ovarian cancer research and 
education and awareness efforts are critical to closing 
these gaps and improving survivorship for women with 
ovarian cancer; 
Whereas each year during the month of September, the Ovar-
ian Cancer Research Alliance and its community partners 
hold a number of events to increase public awareness of 
ovarian cancer and its symptoms; 
Whereas due to current unprecedented circumstances around 
the COVID–19 pandemic, the Ovarian Cancer Research

Alliance reformatted its annual National Conference, 
which draws hundreds of patients, caregivers, and re-
searchers from around the world and typically occurs in- 
person each July and is occurring this year virtually from 
September 29 through October 2; and 
Whereas September 2020 should be designated as ‘‘National 
Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month’’ to increase public 
awareness of ovarian cancer: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives supports

the goals and ideals of National Ovarian Cancer Aware-
