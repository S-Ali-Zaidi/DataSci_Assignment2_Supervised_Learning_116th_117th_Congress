SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress makes the following findings: 
2
(1) In 2009, the National Research Council 
3
published a report entitled ‘‘Strengthening Forensic 
4
Science in the United States: A Path Forward’’, 
5
which provided a roadmap for the future of forensics 
6
research. 
7
(2) The Federal Government, forensic science 
8
community, the research community, and the legal 
9
community have taken steps to move the field of fo-
10
rensic science forward since the release of this re-
11
port. 
12
(3) There are still scientific advances to be 
13
made to bring further rigor to the forensic analyses 
14
used in courts across the United States.
