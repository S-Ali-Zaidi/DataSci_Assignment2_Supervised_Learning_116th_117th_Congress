and west of the Washington Monument.

(2) The dedication of the National World War 
6
II Memorial was the culmination of a 17-year effort 
7
that started when the Memorial was authorized by 
8
an Act of Congress signed into law on May 25,

1993. Construction began September 4, 2001, after 
10
several years of fundraising and public hearings. 
11
(3) Opening to the public on April 29, 2004, 
12
the World War II Memorial is the first national me-
13
morial dedicated to all who served during World

15
achievement of the entire Nation.

(4) The Memorial honors the 16,000,000 who 
17
served in the Armed Forces of the United States 
18
during World War II, the more than 400,000 who 
19
died, and the millions who supported the war effort 
20
from home.

6
tion’s remembrance of the sacrifices made by the 
7
World War II generation.

programs.

(8) The Friends of the National World War II 
13
Memorial play a vital role in the preservation and 
14
maintenance of the National World War II Memorial 
15
as a treasure for the American people, while helping 
16
to facilitate key commemorative and educational pro-
17
grams at the Memorial to pay tribute to America’s 
18
‘‘Greatest Generation’’ and their efforts to preserve 
19
liberty for generations to come.

21
stands as an important symbol of America’s national

power that flows when free people are at once united
