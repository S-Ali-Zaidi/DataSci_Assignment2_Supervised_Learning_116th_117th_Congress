RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the designation of April 11, 2019, 
as ‘‘Remanufacturing Day’’. 
Whereas remanufacturing is a comprehensive and rigorous 
industrial process by which a previously sold, leased, 
used, worn, or nonfunctional product or part is returned 
to a ‘‘same-as-when-new’’ or better condition, from both 
a quality and performance perspective, through a con-
trolled, reproducible, and sustainable process; 
Whereas remanufacturing has been recognized by leading 
universities, research institutions, and manufacturers 
around the world as the highest form of recycling, by re-
ducing greenhouse gas production, saving energy, and re-
claiming end-of-life products;
