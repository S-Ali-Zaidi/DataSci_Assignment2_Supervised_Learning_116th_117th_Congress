SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
5
Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) The incidence of unwanted telephone calls 
7
and text messages is a nationwide nuisance. 
8
(2) The Federal Trade Commission received al-
9
most 5,800,000 complaints about unwanted tele-
10
phone calls in fiscal year 2018. 
11
(3) Telephone scammers target vulnerable con-
12
sumers, particularly the elderly. 
13
(4) The national ‘‘do-not-call’’ registry has ef-
14
fectively addressed unwanted telephone calls from le-
15
gitimate companies, but consumers continue to be 
16
subject to unwanted calls originating from sources 
17
outside the United States and illegitimate operators. 
18
(5) Telemarketing fraud cost consumers an es-
19
timated $350,000,000 in 2011. 
20
(6) Existing Federal law is inadequate to ad-
21
dress this problem. 
22
(7) Preventing unwanted telephone calls and 
23
text messages from reaching consumers requires 2 
24
approaches:
