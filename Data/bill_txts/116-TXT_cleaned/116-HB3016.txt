Congress finds the following:

•HR 3016 IH
(1) Liver cancer is the fastest-growing cause of 
1
cancer death in the United States and among the 
2
leading causes of cancer deaths globally. 
3
(2) In 2018, approximately 42,220 people in 
4
the United States will be diagnosed with primary 
5
liver cancer, and approximately 30,200 will die from 
6
the disease. 
7
(3) Liver cancer is a leading cause of cancer 
8
death among the Asian-American and Pacific Is-
9
lander community. 
10
(4) The most vulnerable Asian-Americans are 
11
those who are foreign-born, low-income, and living in 
12
ethnic enclaves. 
13
(5) Asian and Pacific Islander men and women 
14
are more than twice as likely to develop liver cancer 
15
compared to the non-Hispanic White population. 
16
(6) Among the Asian and Pacific Islander pop-
17
ulation, the higher incidence rate of liver cancer is 
18
partially explained by higher incidence rates of Hep-
19
atitis B and diabetes, which are comorbidities shown 
20
to increase an individual’s risk of developing liver 
21
cancer. 
22
(7) The most common causes of liver cancer in-
23
clude Hepatitis B virus and Hepatitis C virus infec-
24
tion. 
25
00:53 Jun 08, 2019
H3016

•HR 3016 IH
(8) Hepatitis B is a primary risk factor for de-
1
veloping liver cancer, and 1 in 4 of those chronically 
2
infected with hepatitis B develop cirrhosis, liver fail-
3
ure, or liver cancer. 
4
(9) Half of all individuals with hepatitis B in 
5
the United States are Asian-American or Pacific Is-
6
lander, though this group accounts for only 5 per-
7
cent of the U.S. population. 
8
(10) Among African immigrants in the United 
9
States, the prevalence of hepatitis B infection is ap-
10
proximately 1 in 10, and African immigrants make 
11
up 30 percent of those with chronic hepatitis B in-
12
fection in the United States. 
13
(11) Among Hispanic/Latino communities, liver 
14
cancer incidence and death rates are twice as high 
15
compared to the non-Hispanic White population. 
16
(12) Hispanics/Latinos are 60 percent more 
17
likely to die from viral hepatitis than non-Hispanic 
18
Whites.
