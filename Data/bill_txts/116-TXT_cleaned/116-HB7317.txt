SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Masks Work Act of 
2
2020’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) The SARS–CoV–2 virus has killed over 
6
110,000 Americans and infected at least 2,000,000 
7
others. 
8
(2) The measures taken to contain the virus, in-
9
cluding social distancing and stay at home orders, 
10
have resulted in a significant economic disruption, 
11
causing tens of millions of Americans to lose jobs 
12
and income. 
13
(3) Scientific experts, including Dr. Anthony 
14
Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy 
15
and Infectious Diseases, have warned of the danger 
16
of a second wave of infections striking the United 
17
States in fall and winter. 
18
(4) Scientific experts within the United States 
19
Government and elsewhere have strongly advised 
20
Americans to wear cloth face coverings as a means 
21
to slow the spread of COVID–19 and have stated 
22
that wearing cloth face coverings may reduce the 
23
spread of respiratory droplets that may carry the 
24
disease.

(5) There is a growing body of scientific re-
1
search indicating that high levels of cloth face cov-
2
ering adoption by a population can reduce trans-
3
mission of the virus, and may prevent asymptomatic 
4
or presymptomatic carriers from unknowingly infect-
5
ing others. 
6
(6) One scientific model estimated that if 80 
7
percent of the population adopted proper face cov-
8
ering use, transmission would be 1⁄12 what it would 
9
be in a population without wearing cloth face cov-
10
erings. Another newly released study conducted with 
11
animals found that face coverings reduced trans-
12
mission of COVID–19 by 75 percent. 
13
(7) Nations in Southeast Asia with high levels 
14
of cloth face covering wearing have been more effec-
15
tive than others in reducing the spread of COVID– 
16
19, and have experienced comparably fewer infec-
17
tions and deaths as a result. 
18
(8) A recent study from the University of 
19
Iowa’s College of Public Health suggests that the 15 
20
States and the District of Columbia, having man-
21
dated wearing face coverings in public between April 
22
8, 2020, and May 15, 2020, averted as many as 
23
230,000 to 450,000 COVID–19 cases.

(9) Many Americans have heeded the calls of 
1
public health experts to wear cloth face coverings 
2
and have made major sacrifices in other aspects of 
3
their life in order to control the spread of the virus. 
4
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
5
It is the sense of Congress that — 
6
(1) following the consensus advice of public 
7
health experts to wear face coverings can meaning-
8
fully reduce transmission rates for COVID–19, re-
9
sulting in fewer deaths, fewer Americans made seri-
10
ously ill, and lower economic disruption; 
11
(2) Americans should wear appropriate face 
12
coverings in situations where social distancing is dif-
13
ficult or impossible, particularly in indoors environ-
14
ments, both to protect themselves and to protect 
15
older Americans or others with health conditions 
16
that increase the risks of serious illness due to 
17
COVID–19; and 
18
(3) leaders across the political spectrum should 
19
model medically recommended behaviors by wearing 
20
face coverings appropriately and encouraging those 
21
around them to do the same.
