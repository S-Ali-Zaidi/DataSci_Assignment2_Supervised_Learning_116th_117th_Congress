A BILL 
To authorize the Secretary of Defense to carry out research, 
development, test, and evaluation activities, on a joint 
basis with the United Kingdom, to establish directed 
energy capabilities that address threats to the United 
States, deployed forces of the United States, or the 
United Kingdom, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘United States-United 
2
Kingdom Directed Energy Cooperation Act’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) Directed energy platforms are electro-
6
magnetic systems capable of converting chemical or 
7
electrical energy to radiated energy and focusing it 
8
on a target, resulting in physical damage that de-
9
grades or neutralizes an adversarial capability. 
10
These systems include high-energy lasers that emit 
11
photons and high-power microwaves that release ra-
12
diofrequency waves. 
13
(2) Directed energy platforms hold enormous 
14
potential for non-lethal, defensive capabilities, in-
15
cluding protection against advanced missiles and 
16
swarms of unmanned aerial systems. 
17
(3) At a fraction of the per-use cost of kinetic 
18
defense platforms, directed energy capabilities could 
19
greatly enhance the deterrence posture of the United 
20
States and protect against emerging threats such as 
21
hypersonic and maneuverable missiles. 
22
(4) Collaboration between the United States 
23
and the United Kingdom on the development and 
24
application of directed energy weapon technologies 
25
can be traced back to 2010. The UK/US Directed

•HR 3626 IH
Energy Symposium was created under bilateral ex-
1
change agreements between the United States and 
2
the United Kingdom, covering topics such as high- 
3
energy lasers, modeling and simulation, and protec-
4
tion against high-power radio frequency weapons. 
5
(5) In response to technological advances and 
6
emerging threats, the United States has increased 
7
investments in next-generation directed energy capa-
8
bilities and is exploring the potential for boost-phase 
9
ballistic missile defense with the Low-Power Laser 
10
Demonstrator program. Existing programs within 
11
each service branch are developing technologies to 
12
protect members of the Armed Forces from rocket, 
13
artillery, mortar, and unmanned aerial systems. 
14
(6) In 2017, the United Kingdom’s Ministry of 
15
Defence awarded £30M to an international defense 
16
consortium to build a prototype for the Laser Di-
17
rected Energy Weapon (LDEW) Capability Demon-
18
strator. The air defense system will be capable of en-
19
gaging targets in land and maritime environments. 
20
(7) In 2017, the United Kingdom’s Minister for 
21
Defence Procurement Harriett Baldwin said, ‘‘The 
22
UK has long enjoyed a reputation as a world leader 
23
in innovation and it is truly ground-breaking 
24
projects like the Laser Directed Energy Weapon

which will keep this country ahead of the curve. The 
1
Defense Innovation Initiative and £800M Defense 
2
Innovation Fund aim to encourage imagination, in-
3
genuity and entrepreneurship, in pursuit of main-
4
taining a military advantage in the future.’’. 
5
(8) In 2018, while offering remarks at the Di-
6
rected Energy Summit, Undersecretary of Defense 
7
for Research and Engineering Michael Griffin ex-
8
pressed support for the United States partnering 
9
with allies to develop directed energy technologies. 
10
(9) In 2019, the United States Missile Defense 
11
Review highlighted the promise that high-powered 
12
laser technology holds for boost-phase ballistic mis-
13
sile defense.
