inflation, soaring crime rates, and an authoritarian 
1
President. 
2
(2) President Nicola´s Maduro and his prede-
3
cessor have, through authoritarianism, graft, and in-
4
competence, precipitated a massive humanitarian 
5
crisis both inside Venezuela and throughout the 
6
Western Hemisphere. 
7
(3) The Venezuelan gross domestic product is 
8
expected to contract for the sixth year in a row in 
9
2019, with the Government defaulting on its exter-
10
nal debt and inflation projected to exceed 1 million 
11
percent this year. 
12
(4) Health outcomes in Venezuela have ap-
13
proached critical levels as food, medicine, and serv-
14
ices become increasingly inaccessible, with 11.4 per-
15
cent of children in Venezuela under 5 years old suf-
16
fering from moderate or acute malnutrition. 
17
(5) Nearly 10 percent of Venezuela’s population 
18
of 31 million have fled overseas, with nearly 90 per-
19
cent of those remaining living in poverty. 
20
(6) Venezuelans have lost an average of 19 
21
pounds of weight due to nationwide food shortages 
22
since the beginning of the country’s economic crisis.

(7) Venezuela is suffering from an 88 percent 
1
medicine shortage, with more than 22,000 doctors 
2
leaving Venezuela in the past 4 years. 
3
(8) The Maduro Government has repeatedly re-
4
jected offers of humanitarian assistance, despite the 
5
return of once-vanquished diseases like diphtheria 
6
and measles, rampant cases of malaria, and the 
7
sharp rise in infant and maternal mortality. 
8
(9) Venezuela’s rates of homicide and other 
9
crimes have risen dramatically over the course of the 
10
crisis, with chronic underreporting contributing to 
11
an insufficient understanding of the scope of the cri-
12
sis.
