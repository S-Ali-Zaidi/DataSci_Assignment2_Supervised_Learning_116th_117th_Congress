SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) 
In 
December 
2019, 
a 
novel 
(new) 
3
coronavirus known as SARS–CoV–2 was first de-
4
tected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, People’s Republic 
5
of China, causing outbreaks of the coronavirus dis-
6
ease COVID–19 that has now spread globally. 
7
(2) Secretary Azar declared a Public Health 
8
Emergency under section 319 of the Public Health 
9
Service Act (42 U.S.C. 247d) for the United States 
10
for the transmission of the 2019 novel coronavirus, 
11
originating out of Wuhan, Hubei Province China, on 
12
January 31, 2020. 
13
(3) President Donald J. Trump proclaimed, on 
14
March 13, 2020, that the COVID–19 outbreak in 
15
the United States constitutes a national emergency, 
16
beginning March 1, 2020. 
17
(4) In order to catalyze and stabilize consistent 
18
growth in the economy, schools must be protected 
19
from liability of persons on campus (including stu-
20
dents, employees, and visitors) who assume the risk 
21
of contracting the virus upon return to the 2020– 
22
2021 academic school year. There is a strong desire 
23
from Congress to make sure academic institutions 
24

25
threat of economic penalties from assumed risk.
