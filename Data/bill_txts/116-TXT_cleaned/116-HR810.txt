RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the Free File program has made vital contributions to 
the public. 
Whereas the Free File program is an innovative public-pri-
vate partnership between tax preparation software com-
panies, also known as the Free File Alliance, and the In-
ternal Revenue Service (IRS) to offer free online tax 
preparation and e-filing services to low- and moderate-in-
come taxpayers at no cost to the Government; 
Whereas a recent independent study over the Free File pro-
gram stated that this critical public-private partnership 
provides ‘‘substantial’’ benefits, and that without this 
partnership, the ‘‘IRS would sustain prohibitive costs in 
funding such a program itself, with added risk of com-
peting with a highly competitive private sector’’;

Whereas 100,000,000 individuals, or 70 percent of taxpayers, 
are eligible to qualify for the Free File program each 
year; 
Whereas, since 2003, over 53,000,000 American taxpayers 
have filed their taxes for free through the Free File pro-
gram, saving them over $1,600,000,000 in tax prepara-
tion fees; 
Whereas 22 States and the District of Columbia have also 
created their own Free File program modeled after the 
IRS Free File Program; 
Whereas the Free File program compliments other free tax 
preparation services, such as the Volunteer Income Tax 
Assistance (VITA) program, that work to promote the 
welfare of our Nation’s most vulnerable populations; 
Whereas these populations that are impacted by VITA in-
clude those who are disabled, the elderly, and limited 
English-speaking taxpayers who need assistance in pre-
paring their own tax returns; 
Whereas the Free File program is featured on a wide range 
of tax preparation products donated by the best known 
and most trusted industry-leading private sector tax 
preparation companies; 
Whereas through these donations, these companies allow tax-
payers to choose who they file with and promote competi-
tion within their industry; 
Whereas the Free File program has also actively engaged in 
a collaborative effort to fight stolen identity tax refund 
fraud through the IRS Security Summit; 
Whereas this summit consists of the IRS, State tax agencies, 
and various entities from the tax industry;

•HRES 810 IH 
Whereas the Security Summit consists of 6 working groups 
that address identity theft, and in the first 2 years after 
the summit’s establishment, the number of reported iden-
tity theft victims fell by 65 percent, tax returns with con-
firmed identity theft decreased, and the IRS withheld 
$6,000,000,000 in fraudulent refunds; and 
Whereas the benefits of the Free File program have shown 
that the Free File program encourages consumer choice 
and savings for the Government, and promotes strong cy-
bersecurity protections for individuals filing a tax return: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives recog-
1
nizes the vital contributions the Free File program has 
2
made to the public and fully supports the continued suc-
3
cess of the program.
