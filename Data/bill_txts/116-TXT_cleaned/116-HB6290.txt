1
Americans at risk; 
2
(2) direct economic stimulus such as advanced 
3
refundable tax credits, referred to as universal emer-
4
gency rebates in this Act, can help bring much need-
5
ed relief to people who need short-term payments 
6
now in order to get by during this crisis; 
7
(3) these direct payments should supplement 
8
the immediate, substantial expansion of existing so-
9
cial insurance programs including but not limited to 
10
unemployment insurance, supplemental nutrition as-
11
sistance program, Medicaid, as well as relief for 
12
small businesses and other emergency economic 
13

(4) as soon as possible and not later than two 
15

16
the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with 
17
the Commissioner of the Social Security Administra-
18
tion and the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue 
19
