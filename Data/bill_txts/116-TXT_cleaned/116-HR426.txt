RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the United States should continue to engage with and 
support the people and governments of El Salvador, Gua-
temala, and Honduras in order to improve security and 
prosperity and address the root causes of migration to 
the United States. 
Whereas two-thirds of the population of Honduras and nearly 
60 percent of the population of Guatemala live in pov-
erty, according to the World Bank; 
Whereas El Salvador and Honduras have two of the world’s 
highest murder rates, according to the United Nations 
Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC);

•HRES 426 IH 
Whereas the region of Central America that encompasses the 
countries of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, 
commonly known as the ‘‘Northern Triangle’’, is a major 
trafficking route for illegal drugs, including for 90 per-
cent of the cocaine destined for the United States; 
Whereas youth in Northern Triangle countries are relent-
lessly persecuted by gangs and often victims of forced re-
cruitment; 
Whereas more than a quarter of youth in each country be-
tween the ages of 15 and 24 is not engaged in employ-
ment, education, or vocational training; 
Whereas El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras all receive 
low scores in Transparency International’s Corruption 
Perceptions Index, indicating a high degree of perceived 
corruption; 
Whereas the rate of impunity in all three countries has been 
estimated at over 90 percent; 
Whereas violent crimes targeting women, including femicides, 
occur at alarming rates and are rarely prosecuted; 
Whereas violence, poverty, forced gang recruitment, food in-
security, absence of rule of law, and corruption and ex-
tortion are among the key factors driving people to mi-
grate from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras; 
Whereas research shows that violence is a direct driver of mi-
gration; 
Whereas according to the Inter-American Dialogue, ‘‘a 1 per-
cent increase in homicides corresponds with respective in-
creases in migration of 120%, 100%, and 188% in Hon-
duras, Guatemala, and El Salvador’’;

•HRES 426 IH 
Whereas the Northern Triangle countries are the primary 
source of irregular migration flows to the United States; 
Whereas in 2014, the conditions in the Northern Triangle 
contributed to a crisis in which the U.S. Border Patrol 
apprehended nearly 52,000 unaccompanied minors at the 
southwest border of the United States, according to the 
Congressional Research Service; 
Whereas, while the United States has been committed to a 
strong foreign assistance program for the Northern Tri-
angle to improve good governance and spur economic de-
velopment, these countries are still experiencing economic 
insecurity, corruption and violence; 
Whereas it remains essential that the United States continues 
to implement development programs in the region; 
Whereas promoting security, the rule of law, and economic 
prosperity in this region is a long-term goal, and to suc-
cessfully allocate aid to these countries, the United States 
should continue to assist, and should work to maintain 
effectiveness of its foreign development assistance pro-
grams, through institutions such as the new United 
States International Development Finance Corporation, 
which was established under the Better Utilization of In-
vestments Leading to Development Act of 2018 or the 
BUILD Act of 2018 (division F of Public Law 115–254); 
Whereas, on March 20, 2019, the Overseas Private Invest-
ment Corporation, which is the predecessor to the United 
States International Development Finance Corporation, 
approved more than $350 million in financing to con-
struct a liquified natural gas power generation facility in 
El Salvador;

•HRES 426 IH 
Whereas the new power generation facility would become the 
largest thermal power plant in El Salvador and would in-
crease the country’s power generating capacity by 23 per-
cent, helping it meet growing demand and reduce depend-
ence on diesel and heavy fuel oil; 
Whereas the U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central Amer-
ica constitutes a multi-faceted, bipartisan approach to 
improve governance and security and enhance prosperity 
in the region; 
Whereas United States foreign assistance to governmental 
and non-governmental organizations has enabled the in-
vestigation and prosecution of important corruption 
cases, a reduction in crime in many dangerous neighbor-
hoods of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, the sei-
zure of record amounts of illegal drugs, increased employ-
ment opportunities for youth, and the strengthening of 
the agricultural sector in the region; 
Whereas, for example, United States food security and agri-
cultural assistance programs in Guatemala helped create 
more than 78,000 jobs and $160 million in sales from 
2013 to 2017, according to the United States Agency for 
International Development; and 
Whereas targeted United States security assistance in gang- 
controlled neighborhoods contributed to a reduction in 
homicides by more than 50 percent in Rivera Hernandez 
in Honduras, according to the Los Angeles Times, and 
a reduction in homicides by 61 percent in targeted mu-
nicipalities in El Salvador, according to the United States 
Agency for International Development: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
