•HR 1908 IH
(1) Rodrick W. Edmonds (in this Act referred 
1
to as ‘‘Roddie Edmonds’’ or ‘‘Edmonds’’) was born 
2
in 1919 in South Knoxville, Tennessee, and grad-
3
uated from Knoxville High School in 1938. 
4
(2) Roddie Edmonds was a Master Sergeant in 
5
the United States Army and a member of the 422nd 
6
Infantry Regiment while serving during World War 
7
II. 
8
(3) Roddie Edmonds landed in Europe in 1944 
9
and fought to the border between Belgium and Ger-
10
many. In December of 1944, while fighting in the 
11
Battle of the Bulge, Edmonds was captured by Nazi 
12
forces and detained in Stalag IX–A, a prisoner of 
13
war camp in Ziegenhain, Germany. 
14
(4) Stalag IX–A was a site used to identify, 
15
segregate, and remove Jewish soldiers from the gen-
16
eral population of prisoners of war and many of the 
17
Jewish soldiers who were so removed were sent to 
18
labor camps or murdered. Members of the Armed 
19
Forces were warned of this policy and aware that 
20
their fellow servicemen could be at risk. 
21
(5) As the senior noncommissioned officer in 
22
Stalag IX–A, Master Sergeant Edmonds was re-
23
sponsible for 1,275 members of the Armed Forces at 
24
the camp. Approximately 1 month after the date on

which Edmonds was detained, Edmonds was di-
1
rected to order the Jewish-American soldiers under 
2
his command to fall out in order to separate the 
3
Jewish-American soldiers from their fellow prisoners. 
4
(6) Disregarding the orders of the Nazis, 
5
Roddie Edmonds commanded all of his men to fall 
6
out and, the following morning, all of the 1,275 
7
members of the Armed Forces under the command 
8
of Edmonds stood outside of their prison barracks. 
9
(7) Upon seeing the soldiers, a German officer 
10
angrily shouted, ‘‘They cannot all be Jews!’’, to 
11
which Edmonds replied, ‘‘We are all Jews here’’. 
12
(8) The German officer took out his pistol and 
13
pointed the gun at the head of Edmonds, but Ed-
14
monds refused to identify the Jewish soldiers. In-
15
stead, Edmonds responded, ‘‘According to the Gene-
16
va Convention, we only have to give our name, rank, 
17
and serial number. If you shoot me, you will have 
18
to shoot all of us and, after the war, you will be 
19
tried for war crimes’’. 
20
(9) The German officer turned away from Ed-
21
monds and the other soldiers and left the scene. The 
22
actions taken by Edmonds saved the lives of ap-
23
proximately 200 Jewish-American members of the 
24
Armed Forces.

(10) Lester Tanner, a Jewish-American mem-
1
ber of the Armed Forces also captured during the 
2
Battle of the Bulge, witnessed the incident and stat-
3
ed that, ‘‘There was no question in my mind, or that 
4
of Master Sergeant Edmonds, that the Germans 
5
were removing the Jewish prisoners from the general 
6
population at great risk to their survival. The U.S. 
7
Army’s standing command to its ranking officers in 
8
9
for the safety of your men to the greatest extent 
10
possible. Master Sergeant Edmonds, at the risk of 
11
his immediate death, defied the Germans with the 
12
unexpected consequences that the Jewish prisoners 
13
were saved’’. 
14
(11) Edmonds survived 100 days in captivity 
15
and returned home after the war. Later, Edmonds 
16
served the United States in Korea as a member of 
17
the National Guard. Edmonds died in 1985, but 
18
never told his family or anyone else of his brave ac-
19
tions outside the barracks of Stalag IX–A during 
20
World War II. 
21
(12) Edmonds was posthumously recognized by 
22
Yad Vashem, the World Holocaust Remembrance 
23
Center in Jerusalem, as ‘‘Righteous Among the Na-
24
tions’’, the first member of the Armed Forces and

1 of only 5 people of the United States to be so rec-
1
ognized. Avner Shalev, Chairman of Yad Vashem, 
2
announced the selection of Edmonds by saying, 
3
‘‘Master Sergeant Roddie Edmonds seemed like an 
4
ordinary American soldier, but he had an extraor-
5
dinary sense of responsibility and dedication to his 
6
fellow human beings. . . . The choices and actions 
7
of Master Sergeant Edmonds set an example for his 
8
fellow American soldiers as they stood united against 
9
the barbaric evil of the Nazis’’.
