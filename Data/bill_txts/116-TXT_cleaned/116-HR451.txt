16 through June 23, 2019, as National GI Bill Com-

sive set of veterans benefits during a fireside chat saying, 
‘‘While concentrating on military victory, we are not ne-
glecting the planning of things to come . . . among many 
other things we are, today, laying plans for the return to 
civilian life of our gallant men and women in the Armed 
Services.’’;

Whereas, on June 22, 1944, in demonstration of the full sup-
port of the United States for the transition of members 
of the Armed Forces to civilian life, President Franklin 
D. Roosevelt signed into law the Servicemen’s Readjust-
ment Act of 1944 (58 Stat. 284), more commonly known 
as the ‘‘G.I. Bill of Rights’’; 
Whereas such Act was the culmination of the tireless work 
and advocacy of Veteran Service Organizations and Mem-
bers of Congress; 
Whereas such Act made immediate financial support, trans-
formative educational benefits, and home loan guarantees 
available to the 16,000,000 veterans who served in the 
Armed Forces during World War II; 
Whereas such Act helped 7,800,000 veterans enroll in post- 
secondary education or training and democratize higher 
education in America and caused total post-secondary 
education 
enrollment 
to 
grow 
exponentially 
from 
1,676,856 in 1945, with veterans accounting for 5.2 per-
cent of the total, to 2,338,226 in 1947, with veterans ac-
counting for 49.2 percent of that total; 
Whereas such Act contributed 450,000 engineers, 240,000 
accountants, 238,000 teachers, 91,000 scientists, 67,000 
doctors, 122,000 dentists, 17,000 writers and editors, 
and thousands of other professionals to the workforce of 
the United States and expanded the middle class more 
than at any other point in American history; 
Whereas such Act expressed the duty, responsibility, and de-
sire of a grateful United States to see to it that those 
who served on active duty in the Armed Forces are af-
forded every opportunity to become disciplined forces for

prosperity and progress in the United States through 
economic opportunity and investment; 
Whereas Congress enacted subsequent Acts to provide edu-
cational assistance to new generations of veterans, includ-
ing the Veterans’ Readjustment Benefits Act of 1966 
(Public Law 89–358), the Post-Vietnam Era Veterans’ 
Educational Assistance Act of 1977 (Public Law 94– 
502), the Veterans’ Educational Assistance Act of 1984 
(Public Law 98–525), the Post-9/11 Veterans Edu-
cational Assistance Act of 2008 (Public Law 110–252), 
and the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assist-
ance Act of 2017 (Public Law 115–247); 
Whereas since the signing of such Act, the U.S. Department 
of Veterans Affairs has paid about $400 billion in edu-
cational benefits to 25 million veterans and their loved 
ones who continue to excel academically in post-secondary 
education; 
Whereas such Act created the U.S. Department of Veterans 
Affairs Home Loan Guarantee program, which, since 
1944, has provided a pathway for 24 million veterans to 
purchase a home guaranteed by the Department, the ma-
jority of which are purchased with no down payment; 
Whereas such Act improved health care opportunities for vet-
erans by transferring medical facilities from the U.S. 
Army and U.S. Navy and providing funding for U.S. De-
partment of Veterans Affairs hospitals; 
Whereas this combination of opportunities changed the social 
and economic fabric of the United States for the better, 
with a 1988 report from the Subcommittee on Education 
and Health of the Joint Economic Committee of Con-
gress concluding that for every $1 the United States in-

vested in such Act, $6.90 was returned in growth to the 
economy of the United States; 
Whereas 1,262 Members of Congress served in the U.S. mili-
tary on or after June 22, 1944, and, therefore, many 
Members of Congress directly benefitted from the pas-
sage of this Act; 
Whereas June 22, 2019, is the 75th Anniversary of the Act 
being signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt; 
and 
Whereas the week of June 16 through June 23, 2019, is an 
appropriate week to designate as ‘‘National GI Bill Com-
memoration Week’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—

Readjustment Act of 1944 (58 Stat. 284) in democ-
