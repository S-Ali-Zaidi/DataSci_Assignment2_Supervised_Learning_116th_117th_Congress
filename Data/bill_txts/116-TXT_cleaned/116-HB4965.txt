SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. 
7
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
8
(1) A highly skilled workforce is necessary to 
9
compete in the global economy, support economic 
10
growth, and maintain the standard of living of the 
11
United States. 
12
(2) The apprenticeship model is a longstanding, 
13
on-the-job training and education model that pre-
14
pares workers for the skill demands of particular oc-
15
cupations and employers while, at the same time, 
16
providing the workers with recognized, portable cre-
17
dentials, and wages while in training. 
18
(3) The registered apprenticeship program 
19
model has been successful in skilled trade industries, 
20
16:31 Nov 10, 2019
H4965

•HR 4965 IH
including construction and manufacturing, as well as 
1
service industries, such as health care, and holds 
2
great potential for expansion into other industries. 
3
(4) Registered apprenticeships are becoming in-
4
creasingly innovative and diverse in their designs, 
5
partnerships, timeframes, and use of emerging con-
6
cepts such as competency-based learning, and will 
7
continue to evolve to meet emerging skill require-
8
ments, while maintaining high standards and qual-
9
ity. 
10
(5) Registered apprenticeship programs are an 
11
essential element of an effective workforce develop-
12
ment system and help individuals attain a recognized 
13
postsecondary credential, contributing to their per-
14
sonal economic sustainability. 
15
(6) According to a report from the Georgetown 
16
University Center on Education and the Workforce, 
17
by 2020 the United States will face a shortage of 
18
5,000,000 workers with recognized postsecondary 
19
credentials. 
20
(7) According to a 2012 report from the Annie 
21
E. Casey Foundation, youth employment in the 
22
United States has reached the lowest point since 
23
World War II. More than 6,000,000 young people

ages 16 through 24 are disconnected from school 
1
and work. 
2
(8) A 2012 evaluation of registered apprentice-
3
ship programs in 10 States by Mathematica Policy 
4
Research found that— 
5
(A) individuals who completed registered 
6
apprenticeship programs earned over $240,000 
7
more over their careers than individuals not 
8
participating in such apprenticeship programs; 
9
(B) the estimated social benefits of reg-
10
istered apprenticeship programs, including addi-
11
tional productivity of apprentices and the reduc-
12
tion in governmental expenditures as a result of 
13
reduced use of unemployment compensation and 
14
public assistance, exceeded the costs of the pro-
15
grams by more than $49,000 per program; and 
16
(C) the tax return on every Federal Gov-
17
ernment dollar invested in registered appren-
18
ticeship programs was $27. 
19
(b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this Act are— 
20
(1) to increase the number of highly skilled 
21
workers in the United States, particularly in in-de-
22
mand industry sectors and occupations; 
23
(2) to increase the attainment of recognized 
24
postsecondary credentials by participants; 
25
16:31 Nov 10, 2019

•HR 4965 IH
(3) to increase awareness about the value of the 
1
registered apprenticeship program model as an effec-
2
tive earn-and-learn model for students, workers, and 
3
employers; 
4
(4) to support the development and expansion 
5
of registered apprenticeship programs with employ-
6
ers, joint labor-management partnerships, trade and 
7
professional associations, and other program spon-
8
sors, that offer jobs that lead to economic self-suffi-
9
ciency; 
10
(5) to support the development and expansion 
11
of effective pre-apprenticeship programs that lead to 
12
success in a registered apprenticeship program; 
13
(6) to support a closer alignment between reg-
14
istered apprenticeship programs, the workforce de-
15
velopment system, career and technical education, 
16
and postsecondary education, including institutions 
17
of higher education; and 
18
(7) to support innovative models of effective 
19
work-based learning.
