SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) In the past decades it has become standard 
8
practice to publish versions of the White House and 
9
other agency websites in Spanish. 
10
(2) At least 36,000,000 United States residents 
11
who speak Spanish as their first language depend 
12
upon these websites to access important information 
13
that can play a critical role in their life. 
14
(3) In 2010, for 59,000,000 people, English 
15
was not their first language. 
16
(4) In addition to English, the top languages in 
17
the United States are Spanish, Chinese, Tagalog, 
18
Vietnamese, and French. 
19
(5) Millions of people within the United States 
20
will benefit by having websites translated into mul-
21
tiple languages. 
22
(6) The United States of America is a diverse 
23
Nation and, as such, does not have an official lan-
24
guage.

a constant state of growth. We have consistently

rying a hope of achieving the American dream.

(8) As this is happening, the United States 
6
must adapt and make our democracy more accessible

for everyone.
