SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Prior to the COVID–19 pandemic, the 
3
United States faced a mental health crisis. 
4
(2) This mental health crisis touches all age 
5
groups. Suicide rates among individuals ages 10 
6
through 24 increased by 56 percent from 2007 to 
7
2017. More than 25 percent of college students have 
8
been diagnosed or treated by a professional for a 
9
mental health condition within the past year. Nearly 
10
one in five adults in the United States live with a 
11
mental illness. Suicide rates for all ages increased 
12
from 1999 to 2016. 
13
(3) The COVID–19 pandemic has resulted in 
14
large-scale economic hardship and long periods of 
15
social isolation for Americans. 
16
(4) In non-crisis conditions, a 1-point increase 
17
in unemployment correlates to a 1.3 percent increase 
18
in suicide rates. In April 2020, the unemployment 
19
rate increased from 4.4 percent to 14.7 percent. 
20
(5) Exposure to large-scale trauma like the cur-
21
rent pandemic commonly results in negative emo-
22
tional states, acute stress, physical health com-
23
plaints, and poor sleep, particularly during the ini-
24
tial onset of the trauma.

(6) People who receive practical and social sup-
1
port and resources soon after the initial onset of a 
2
trauma tend to have better outcomes. 
3
(7) There is an increased need for mental 
4
health services to be provided through telehealth 
5
platforms due to the necessity for social distancing.
