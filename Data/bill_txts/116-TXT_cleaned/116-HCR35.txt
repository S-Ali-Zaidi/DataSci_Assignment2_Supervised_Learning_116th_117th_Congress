CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of Congress that the United States 
is committed to ensuring a safe and healthy climate 
for future generations, and to creating solutions for re-
storing the climate. 
Whereas humanity has a continuing obligation to provide fu-
ture generations a safe and healthy climate, similar to 
the climate of a hundred years ago; 
Whereas the human species has never before lived with sus-
tained atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels above 300 
parts per million (ppm), which were exceeded in 1925; 
Whereas current CO2 levels are already about 410 ppm, and 
are expected to rise to 450 ppm or higher by 2050, based 
on current Paris Agreement goals;

Whereas the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 
has stated that temperatures corresponding to CO2 levels 
of 450 ppm or above will lead to grave damage to eco-
systems; 
Whereas restoring CO2 to levels of 300 ppm requires remov-
ing about 1 trillion tons of CO2 from the atmosphere, 
and doing that in 20 to 50 years requires removing 50 
gigatons (GT) of CO2 (which is equal to 50 billion tons) 
per year from the atmosphere; 
Whereas multiple methods capable of CO2 removal from the 
atmosphere at 50 GT CO2 per year have been dem-
onstrated, and annual costs for implementing these meth-
ods are expected to be less than 1 to 3 percent of global 
gross domestic product (GDP); 
Whereas if known methods prove to be incapable of removing 
50 GT CO2 per year, then we must develop other meth-
ods that will restore a safe and healthy climate for future 
generations; 
Whereas scientists have researched methods for keeping 
warming below 2° C, but have not yet researched the best 
methods to remove all excess CO2, stop sea-level rise, and 
restore a safe and healthy climate for future generations; 
and 
Whereas declaring a goal of restoring a safe and healthy cli-
mate will encourage scientists to research the most effec-
tive ways to restore safe CO2 levels, stop sea-level rise, 
and restore a safe and healthy climate for future genera-
tions: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate 
1
concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that the
