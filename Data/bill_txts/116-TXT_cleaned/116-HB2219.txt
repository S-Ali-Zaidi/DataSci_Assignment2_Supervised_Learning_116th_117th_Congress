A BILL 
To promote United States-Mongolia trade by authorizing 
duty-free treatment for certain imports from Mongolia, 
and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Mongolia Third Neigh-
4
bor Trade Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) In 1992, Mongolia adopted a constitution 
8
establishing a parliamentary democracy, becoming 
9

•HR 2219 IH
the only country in Asia to transition from com-
1
munism to democracy. Mongolia shares land borders 
2
with only the Russian Federation and the People’s 
3
Republic of China. With a large land area and a 
4
population of only 3,000,000, Mongolia is the 
5
world’s most sparsely populated country, and Mon-
6
golia’s sovereignty is thought to be at risk from the 
7
overwhelming influence of its much larger and more 
8
populous neighbors. 
9
(2) Mongolia has shown its commitment to a 
10
‘‘third neighbor’’ relationship with the United States 
11
by sending troops to support United States combat 
12
operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and has a 
13
strong record of troop contributions to international 
14
peacekeeping missions. Mongolia’s success as a de-
15
mocracy, strategic location, sovereignty, territorial 
16
integrity, and ability to pursue an independent for-
17
eign policy are highly relevant to the national secu-
18
rity of the United States. 
19
(3) Mongolia describes the United States as its 
20
most important ‘‘third neighbor’’, but United States- 
21
Mongolia trade is substantially lower than many 
22
other bilateral trading relationships, and trade has 
23
declined in recent years. Total trade between the 
24
countries in 2012 measured $707,000,000, but in 
25
04:12 Apr 19, 2019
H2219

•HR 2219 IH
2017 the United States exported only $82,200,000 
1
in goods to Mongolia and imported only $9,400,000 
2
in goods from Mongolia. 
3
(4) After mining, agriculture is the second most 
4
important sector contributing to the Mongolian econ-
5
omy. The livestock sector accounts for 87 percent of 
6
agricultural production in Mongolia and employs 
7
around one-third of the working population. 
8
(5) Since the 1940s, the annual mean air tem-
9
perature in Mongolia has risen at three times the 
10
global rate. Average precipitation is declining and 
11
extreme weather disasters are more frequent, posing 
12
acute challenges for livestock herding in the country. 
13
In 2017, an estimated 700,000 of the country’s live-
14
stock population were killed due to the post-drought 
15
extreme winter phenomenon known as ‘‘dzud’’. This 
16
phenomenon is unique to Mongolia and has in-
17
creased in frequency and severity in recent years, 
18
causing a rise in livestock mortality and diminishing 
19
livelihoods for herders which has led to widespread 
20
rural poverty and a contraction in the national econ-
21
omy. 
22
(6) Mongolia would greatly benefit from pref-
23
erential treatment for United States imports of cer-
24
04:12 Apr 19, 2019
H2219
4 
•HR 2219 IH
tain Mongolian products to help address some of the 
1
economic impacts of the dzuds. 
2
(7) The cashmere trade is particularly impor-
3
tant to Mongolia’s economy, but while Mongolia pro-
4
duces over one-third of the world’s raw cashmere, it 
5
produces few finished cashmere products. Most Mon-
6
golian raw cashmere is exported to China, and the 
7
United States buys nearly all of its cashmere prod-
8
ucts from China. Preferential treatment for United 
9
States imports of certain Mongolian products, in-
10
cluding cashmere products, would benefit the United 
11
States by facilitating increased trade with Mongolia. 
12
(8) The development of Mongolia’s garment in-
13
dustry would also promote women’s employment and 
14
empowerment. Women have historically participated 
15
in Mongolia’s garment industry at high rates, and 
16
the garment industry has historically provided safe 
17
and stable employment for women in Mongolia. 
18
(9) In developing and expanding Mongolia’s 
19
cashmere industry, it is critical for Mongolia to take 
20
steps to ensure the protection of its grasslands and 
21
prevent overgrazing of cashmere goats. 
22
(10) Preferential treatment for United States 
23
imports of such Mongolian products would benefit 
24
Mongolia at this critical time.
