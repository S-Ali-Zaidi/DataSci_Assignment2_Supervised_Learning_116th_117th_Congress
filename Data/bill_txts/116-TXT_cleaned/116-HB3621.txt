A BILL 
To amend the Fair Credit Reporting Act to remove adverse 
information for certain defaulted or delinquent private 
education loan borrowers who demonstrate a history of 
loan repayment, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Student Borrower

•HR 3621 IH
(1) The October 2014 report of the Consumer 
1
Financial Protection Bureau titled ‘‘Annual Report 
2
of the CFPB Student Loan Ombudsman’’ noted 
3
many private education loan borrowers, who sought 
4
to negotiate a modified repayment plan when they 
5
were experiencing a period of financial distress, were 
6
unable to get assistance from their loan holders, 
7
which often resulting in them defaulting on their 
8
loans. This pattern resembles the difficulty that a 
9
significant number of mortgage loan borrowers expe-
10
rienced when they sought to take responsible steps 
11
to work with their mortgage loan servicer to avoid 
12
foreclosure during the Great Recession. 
13
(2) Although private student loan holders may 
14
allow a borrower to postpone payments while en-
15
rolled in school full-time, many limit this option to 
16
a certain time period, usually 48 to 66 months. This 
17
limited time period may not be sufficient for those 
18
who need additional time to obtain their degree or 
19
who want to continue their education by pursing a 
20
graduate or professional degree. The Consumer Bu-
21
reau found that borrowers who were unable to make 
22
payments often defaulted or had their accounts sent 
23
to collections before they were even able to graduate.
