SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
The Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Trophy hunting of imperiled species under-
3
mines efforts to conserve wildlife populations be-
4
cause trophy hunters routinely target the biggest, 
5
strongest males, and removing those individuals 
6
from the population can decrease genetic variation, 
7
decrease reproduction, alter social structures, in-
8
crease infanticide, and cause unnatural evolutionary 
9
impacts. 
10
(2) When trophy hunting of imperiled species is 
11
sanctioned, poaching activity increases, further 
12
threatening the survival of wildlife populations. 
13
(3) Legal trade in wildlife parts and products 
14
can provide cover for markets for illegal trade in 
15
wildlife 
products, 
which 
is 
worth 
up 
to 
16
$20,000,000,000 annually and run by professional 
17
criminal networks linked to other transnational orga-
18
nized criminal activities, including trafficking in nar-
19
cotics, weapons, and humans. 
20
(4) While the Endangered Species Act of 1973 
21
(16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) currently prohibits the take 
22
and import of species listed under that Act as en-
23
dangered species, it does not automatically extend 
24
those protections to species listed as threatened spe-
25
cies.
