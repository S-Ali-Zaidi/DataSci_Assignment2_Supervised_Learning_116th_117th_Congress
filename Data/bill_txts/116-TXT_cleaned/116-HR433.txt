RESOLUTION 
Affirming that trade is an integral part of the United States 
economy and the importance of the United States-Mexico 
economic relationship. 
Whereas trade is foundational to the United States economy 
and maintaining healthy trade relationships is essential 
to creating new jobs and maintaining a prosperous econ-
omy; 
Whereas Mexico is one of the United States most important 
trading partners, recently surpassing China as our coun-
try’s top trading partner for 2019; 
Whereas trade with Mexico accounted for 14.5 percent of all 
United States trade in 2018;

Whereas approximately 60,000 United States companies ex-
port to Mexico, roughly one-third of which are small- and 
medium-sized businesses; 
Whereas President Donald Trump has indicated that it is a 
viable strategy to impose a tariff on all imports from 
Mexico that would increase over time; 
Whereas the Department of Commerce estimated that if a 5 
percent tariff on all imported goods from Mexico—which 
totaled $346,500,000,000—had been imposed last year, 
it would have created a potential tax increase on United 
States businesses and consumers of $17,000,000,000; 
Whereas if the tariffs increased to 25 percent, the tax burden 
imposed on United States consumers and businesses 
would soar to $86,000,000,000; 
Whereas if the tariffs are implemented on Mexican imports, 
Mexico could retaliate by imposing tariffs on United 
States exports—which last year alone reached more than 
$265,000,000,000—further harming United States work-
ers, businesses, and consumers; 
Whereas Mexico was the largest supplier of agricultural im-
ports to the United States in 2018, with a total of 
$26,000,000,000 worth of produce and processed fruits 
and vegetables, and any tariff imposed on these goods 
would likely be passed to United States consumers and 
families; and 
Whereas the imposition of tariffs would create economic un-
certainty and potential retaliatory tariffs could cause an 
unexpected supply chain disruption, likely leading to work 
stoppages at United States auto and manufacturing 
plants, and risking the furlough of United States workers
