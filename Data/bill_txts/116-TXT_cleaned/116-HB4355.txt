A BILL 
To direct the Director of the National Science Foundation 
to support research on the outputs that may be gen-

known as deepfakes, and other comparable techniques 
that may be developed in the future, and for other pur-
poses. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Research gaps currently exist on the under-
3
lying technology needed to develop tools to identify 
4
authentic videos, voice reproduction, or photos from 
5
those generated by generative adversarial networks. 
6
(2) The National Science Foundation’s focus to 
7
support research in artificial intelligence through 
8
computer and information science and engineering, 
9
cognitive science and psychology, economics and 
10
game theory, control theory, linguistics, mathe-
11
matics, and philosophy, is building a better under-
12
standing of how new technologies are shaping the 
13
society and economy of the United States. 
14
(3) The National Science Foundation has iden-
15
tified the ‘‘10 Big Ideas for NSF Future Invest-
16
ment’’ including ‘‘Harnessing the Data Revolution’’ 
17
and the ‘‘Future of Work at the Human-Technology 
18
Frontier’’, in with artificial intelligence is a critical 
19
component. 
20
(4) The outputs generated by generative adver-
21
sarial networks should be included under the um-
22
brella of research described in paragraph (3) given 
23
the grave national security and societal impact po-
24
tential of such networks.

(5) Generative adversarial networks are not 
1
likely to be utilized as the sole technique of artificial 
2
intelligence or machine learning capable of creating 
3
credible deepfakes and other comparable techniques 
4
may be developed in the future to produce similar 
5
outputs.

SEC. 3. NSF SUPPORT OF RESEARCH FOR OUTPUTS OF 
7
GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS. 
8
The Director of the National Science Foundation, in 
9
consultation with other relevant Federal agencies, shall 
10
support merit-reviewed and competitively awarded re-
11
search on the science and ethics of material produced by 
12
generative adversarial networks, which may include— 
13
(1) supplementing fundamental research on dig-
14
ital media forensic tools or comparable technologies 
15
for detection of the outputs of generative adversarial 
16
networks completed by the Defense Advanced Re-
17
search Projects Agency and the Intelligence Ad-
18
vanced Research Projects Activity; 
19
(2) fundamental research on developing con-
20
straint aware generative adversarial networks; and 
21
(3) social and behavioral research on the ethics 
22
of the technology, and human engagement with the 
23
networks.

•HR 4355 IH
(1) GENERATIVE
ADVERSARIAL
NETWORK.— 
1
The term ‘‘generative adversarial network’’ means, 
2
with respect to artificial intelligence, the machine 
3
learning process of attempting to cause a generator 
4
artificial neural network (referred to in this para-
5
graph as the ‘‘generator’’ and a discriminator artifi-
6
cial neural network (referred to in this paragraph as 
7
a ‘‘discriminator’’)) to compete against each other to 
8
become more accurate in their function and outputs, 
9
through which the generator and discriminator cre-
10
ate a feedback loop, causing the generator to 
11
produce increasingly higher-quality artificial outputs 
12
and the discriminator to increasingly improve in de-
13
tecting such artificial outputs. 
14
(2) COMPARABLE
TECHNOLOGY.—The term 
15
‘‘comparable technology’’ means technology that uti-
16
lizes similar techniques to achieve the same outputs 
17
as a generative adversarial network. 
18
(3) CONSTRAINT
AWARE.—The term ‘‘con-
19
straint aware’’ means, with respect to artificial intel-
20
ligence, the generation of realistic relational data by 
21
a machine with constraint on the modules generated 
22
by an adversarial network.
