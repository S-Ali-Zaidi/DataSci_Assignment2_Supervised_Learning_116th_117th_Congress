ing in purchasing power parity terms from $3,470 in 
1
1980 to more than $55,000 in 2018; 
2
(2) the experience of Taiwan in creating a vi-
3
brant and advanced economy under democratic gov-
4
ernance and the rule of law can inform the work of 
5
the international financial institutions, including 
6
through the contributions and insights of Taiwanese 
7
nationals; and 
8
(3) Taiwanese nationals who seek employment 
9
at the international financial institutions should not 
10
be held at a disadvantage in hiring because the eco-
11
nomic success of Taiwan has rendered it ineligible 
12
for financial assistance from such institutions.
