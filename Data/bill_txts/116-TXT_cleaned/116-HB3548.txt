A BILL 
To improve data collection and monitoring of the Great 
Lakes, oceans, bays, estuaries, and coasts, and for other 
purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Bolstering Long-Term 
4
Understanding and Exploration of the Great Lakes, 
5
Oceans, Bays, and Estuaries Act’’ or the ‘‘BLUE GLOBE 
6
Act’’.

SEC. 2. PURPOSE. 
1
The purpose of this Act is to promote and support— 
2
(1) the monitoring, understanding, and explo-
3
ration of the Great Lakes, oceans, bays, estuaries, 
4
and coasts; and 
5
(2) the collection, analysis, synthesis, and shar-
6
ing of data related to the Great Lakes, oceans, bays, 
7
estuaries, and coasts to facilitate science and oper-
8
ational decision making. 
9
SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
10
Congress makes the following findings: 
11
(1) The Great Lakes, oceans, bays, estuaries, 
12
and coasts face significant challenges from, among 
13
other things, marine debris, illegal, unreported, and 
14
unregulated fishing, and changing conditions. 
15
(2) Most of the ocean floor is mapped only at 
16
a very coarse resolution of 5 kilometers per pixel, 
17
whereas Mars, the Moon, and Venus are mapped at 
18
a much finer resolution of 100 meters per pixel or 
19
better. 
20
(3) Many industries, including the fishing and 
21
aquaculture, energy, shipping, insurance, telecommu-
22
nications, weather and climate forecasting, and tour-
23
ism industries, among others, use ocean data, wheth-
24
er or not the industries collect that data themselves.

•HR 3548 IH
(4) In 2017, the National Oceanic and Atmos-
1
pheric Administration estimated that United States 
2
businesses that collect ocean data or provide en-
3
hanced ocean data products have overall revenues of 
4
approximately $58,000,000,000. 
5
(5) Although a large amount of data related to 
6
the Great Lakes, oceans, bays, estuaries, and coasts 
7
is collected internationally, nationally, and region-
8
ally, by international bodies, national agencies, insti-
9
tutes, private companies, and other entities, that 
10
data collection is often uncoordinated, and the re-
11
sulting data are not always shared in a timely and 
12
useful manner between those entities. 
13
(6) Improved collection, analysis, synthesis, and 
14
sharing of such data will improve our understanding 
15
of, and responses to, the challenges faced by the 
16
Great Lakes, oceans, bays, estuaries, and coasts. 
17
(7) Innovation, research, and a skilled work-
18
force are required to improve our understanding of 
19
the Great Lakes, oceans, bays, estuaries, and coasts 
20
and the challenges they face. 
21
(8) According to the National Oceanic and At-
22
mospheric Administration, in 2015, the ocean and 
23
Great Lakes economy in the United States employed 
24
approximately 3,200,000 people and accounted for 
25
04:50 Jul 09, 2019
H3548
4 
•HR 3548 IH
approximately $320,000,000,000 of the gross do-
1
mestic product of the United States. 
2
(9) The value and impact of the industries re-
3
lated to the Great Lakes, oceans, bays, estuaries, 
4
and coasts on the economy of the United States are 
5
evidently immense; however, what is known as the 
6
‘‘Blue Economy’’ is neither consistently defined nor 
7
regularly quantified. 
8
(10) The Federal Government has a responsi-
9
bility to support the monitoring, understanding, and 
10
exploration of the Great Lakes, oceans, bays, estu-
11
aries, and coasts in pursuit of the national security 
12
and economic and environmental well-being of the 
13
United States, and as a world leader. 
14
SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
15
It is the sense of Congress that— 
16
(1) agencies should optimize data collection, 
17
management, and dissemination, to the extent prac-
18
ticable, to maximize their impact for research, com-
19
mercial, regulatory, and educational benefits and to 
20
foster innovation, scientific discoveries, the develop-
21
ment of commercial products, and the development 
22
of sound policy with respect to the Great Lakes, 
23
oceans, bays, estuaries, and coasts;

(2) the United States is a leading member of 
1
the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of 
2
the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cul-
3
tural Organization, a founding member of the Atlan-
4
tic Ocean Research Alliance, and a key partner in 
5
developing the United Nations Decade of Ocean 
6
Science for Sustainable Development; 
7
(3) the Integrated Ocean Observing System and 
8
the Global Ocean Observing System are key assets 
9
and networks that bolster our understanding of the 
10
marine environment; 
11
(4) the National Oceanographic Partnership 
12
Program is a meaningful venue for collaboration and 
13
coordination among Federal agencies, scientists, and 
14
ocean users; 
15
(5) the National Centers for Environmental In-
16
formation of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
17
Administration should be looked to by other Federal 
18
agencies as a primary, centralized repository for 
19
Federal ocean data; 
20
(6) the Marine Cadastre, a joint effort of the 
21
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
22
and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, pro-
23
vides access to data and information for specific 
24
issues and activities in ocean resources management

efforts; 
2
(7) the regional associations of the Integrated 
3
Ocean Observing System, certified by the National 
4
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for the 
5
quality and reliability of their data, are important 
6
sources of observation information for the Great 
7
Lakes, oceans, bays, estuaries, and coasts; and 
8
(8) the Regional Ocean Partnerships and re-
9
gional data portals, which provide publicly available 
10
tools such as maps, data, and other information to 
11
inform decisions and enhance marine development, 
12
should be supported by and viewed as collaborators 
13
with Federal agencies and ocean users.
