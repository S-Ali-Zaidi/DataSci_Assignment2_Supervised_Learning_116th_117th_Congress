SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Counterterrorism 
2
Screening and Assistance Act of 2019’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FOREIGN PARTNER ENGAGEMENT PLAN. 
4
(a) FINDINGS.—Consistent with the final report of 
5
the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of 
6
Representatives bipartisan ‘‘Task Force on Combating 
7
Terrorist and Foreign Fighter Travel’’, Congress makes 
8
the following findings: 
9
(1) It is important for the national security of 
10
the United States to assist foreign partners in clos-
11
ing security gaps which may allow terrorists and for-
12
eign fighters to travel internationally, avoiding de-
13
tection. 
14
(2) Building foreign partner capacity to combat 
15
terrorist travel helps extend the United States secu-
16
rity beyond its border to mitigate threats before they 
17
reach the United States. 
18
(3) United States Government departments and 
19
agencies have spent billions of dollars to help foreign 
20
partners improve their security against terrorist 
21
travel since the attacks of September 11, 2001, in-
22
cluding through the provision of technical assistance, 
23
equipment, training, and other tools. 
24
(4) The lack of a United States Government- 
25
wide, risk-based approach increases the odds that 
26
02:46 Feb 02, 2019
H630
3 
•HR 630 IH
systematic security gaps abroad may persist and 
1
that United States response efforts will not be maxi-
2
mized in order to close these gaps. 
3
(5) Failure to effectively coordinate capacity- 
4
building activities also results in greater risk of over-
5
lap, waste, and unnecessary duplication between the 
6
United States and international programs. 
7
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
8
gress that the United States Government must ensure ca-
9
pacity-building assistance to deter travel by terrorists and 
10
foreign fighters is coordinated both among United States 
11
Government departments and agencies as well as with for-
12
eign implementing partners. 
13
(c) PLAN.— 
14
(1) IN
GENERAL.—Not later than 180 days 
15
after the date of the enactment of this Act and every 
16

17

18
of title 31, United States Code, until 2025, the Sec-
19
