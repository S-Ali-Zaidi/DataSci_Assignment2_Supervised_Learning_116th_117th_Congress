Congress finds the following:

•HR 4221 IH
(1) High levels of stress are adversely affecting 
1
teachers’ health. Teachers with high levels of stress 
2
are less effective in raising student achievement than 
3
their healthier peers. 
4
(2) Elementary school teachers who have great-
5
er stress and show more symptoms of depression 
6
create classroom environments that are less condu-
7
cive to learning. 
8
(3) Stress is contributing to the high turnover 
9
rate among teachers, which causes instability for 
10
students and communities. This leads to higher costs 
11
for school districts to train new teachers and hinders 
12
students’ academic success. 
13
(4) School organization, low job autonomy, and 
14
a lack of ability to access teacher leadership oppor-
15
tunities are main sources of teacher stress. If teach-
16
ers are unable to manage their stress levels, this 
17
leads to lower level teacher instruction, which then 
18
impacts student well-being. 
19
(5) High teacher turnover brings down stu-
20
dents’ math and language arts scores. 
21
(6) According to a 2014 Gallup survey, 46 per-
22
cent of teachers experience high daily stress during 
23
the school year. This percentage is tied for the high-
24
est rate of high daily stress among occupations and

improve teacher performance. 
18
(4) Mentoring and induction programs during 
19

20

sion making regarding school interventions and man-

mental health and psychological support.

(7) Complementary health approaches, such as

9
ditions to facilitate the transmission and sharing of 
10
knowledge among teachers.
