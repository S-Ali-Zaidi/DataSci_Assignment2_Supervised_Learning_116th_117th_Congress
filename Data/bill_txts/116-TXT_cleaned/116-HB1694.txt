Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Native American Vot-
4
ing Rights Act of 2019’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. 
6
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) The Constitution explicitly and implicitly 
8
grants Congress broad general powers to legislate on 
9
issues relating to Indian Tribes, powers consistently 
10
described as plenary and exclusive. These powers 
11
arise from the grant of authority in the Indian Com-
12
merce Clause and through legislative matters arising 
13
under the Treaty Clause. 
14
(2) The Federal Government is responsible for 
15
upholding the obligations that the Federal Govern-
16
ment has agreed to through treaties, legislation, and 
17
executive orders, referred to as the Federal trust re-
18
sponsibility toward Indian Tribes and their mem-
19
bers. 
20
(3) The Supreme Court has repeatedly relied on 
21
the nature of this ‘‘government to government’’ rela-
22
tionship between the United States and sovereign 
23
Indian Tribes for congressional authority to enact 
24
‘‘legislation that singles out Indians for particular 
25

and special treatment.’’ Morton v. Mancari, 417 
1
U.S. 535, 554–555 (1974). 
2
(4) Legislation removing barriers to Native 
3
American voting is vital for the fulfillment of Con-
4
gress’ ‘‘unique obligation’’ toward Indians, particu-
5
larly ensuring that Native American voters are fully 
6
included as ‘‘qualified members of the modern body 
7
politic.’’ Board of County Comm’rs v. Seber, 318 
8
U.S. 705, 715 (1943). 
9
(5) Under the Elections Clause of article I, sec-
10
tion 4 of the Constitution, Congress has additional 
11
power to regulate any election conducted at least in 
12
part to select Members of Congress. Taken together, 
13
the Indian Commerce Clause and the Election 
14
Clause give Congress broad authority to enact legis-
15
lation to safeguard the voting rights of Native Amer-
16
ican voters. 
17
(6) Despite Congress’ decision to grant Native 
18
Americans Federal citizenship, and with it the pro-
19
tections of the Fifteenth Amendment, with passage 
20
of the Act of June 2, 1924 (Public Law 68–233; 43 
21
Stat. 253) (commonly known as the ‘‘Indian Citizen-
22
ship Act of 1924’’), States continued to deploy dis-
23
tinct methods for disenfranchising Indians by enact-
24
ing statutes to exclude from voter rolls Indians liv-
25

ing on reservations, requiring that Indians first ter-
1
minate their relationship with their Indian Tribe, re-
2
stricting the right to vote on account of a Tribal 
3
member’s ‘‘guardianship’’ status, and imposing lit-
4
eracy tests. 
5
(7) Barriers to voter access for Native Ameri-
6
cans persist today, and such barriers range from ob-
7
structing voter access, to vote dilution and inten-
8
tional malapportionment of electoral districts. 
9
(8) The Native American Voting Rights Coali-
10
tion’s recent 9 field hearings in Indian Country and 
11
4-State survey of voter discrimination revealed a 
12
number of additional obstacles that Native Ameri-
13
cans must overcome in some States, including— 
14
(A) a lack of accessible registration and 
15
polling sites, either due to conditions such as 
16
geography, lack of paved roads, the absence of 
17
reliable and affordable broadband connectivity, 
18
and restrictions on the time and place that peo-
19
ple can register and vote, and the manner in 
20
which people can register and vote, including 
21
unequal opportunities for absentee, early, mail- 
22
in, and in-person voting; 
23
(B) nontraditional addresses for residents 
24
on Indian reservations, which make voter reg-
25

•HR 1694 IH
istration, acquisition of mail-in ballots, and se-
1
curing required identification difficult, if not 
2
impossible; 
3
(C) inadequate language assistance for 
4
Tribal members, including lack of outreach and 
5
publicity, the failure to provide complete, accu-
6
rate, and uniform translations of all voting ma-
7
terials in the relevant Native language, and an 
8
insufficient number of trained bilingual poll 
9
workers; and 
10
(D) voter identification laws that discrimi-
11
nate against Native Americans. 
12
(9) The Department of Justice and courts have 
13
also recognized that some jurisdictions have been 
14
unresponsive to reasonable requests from federally 
15
recognized Indian Tribes for more accessible voter 
16
registration sites and in-person voting locations. 
17
(10) According to the National Congress of 
18
American Indians, there is a wide gap between the 
19
voter registration and turnout rates of eligible Amer-
20
ican Indians and Alaska Natives, and the voter reg-
21
istration and turnout rates of non-Hispanic White 
22
and other racial and ethnic groups. 
23
02:10 Apr 02, 2019
H1694

•HR 1694 IH
(11) Despite these obstacles, the Native Amer-
1
ican vote continues to play a significant role in na-
2
tional, State, and local elections. 
3
(12) In Alaska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and 
4
South Dakota, Native Americans comprise approxi-
5
mately 10 percent or more of the voting population. 
6
(13) The Native American vote also holds great 
7
potential, with over 1,000,000 voters who are eligible 
8
to vote, but are not registered to vote. 
9
(b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this Act are— 
10
(1) to fulfill the Federal Government’s trust re-
11
sponsibility to protect and promote Native Ameri-
12
cans’ exercise of their constitutionally guaranteed 
13
right to vote, including the right to register to vote 
14
and the ability to access all mechanisms for voting; 
15
(2) to establish preclearance procedures for a 
16
specific subset of State actions that have been used 
17
to restrict access to the polls on Indian lands; 
18
(3) to expand voter registration under the Na-
19
tional Voter Registration Act of 1993 (52 U.S.C. 
20
20506 et seq.) to cover all Federal facilities, at the 
21
request of the Indian Tribe; 
22
(4) to afford equal treatment to forms of identi-
23
fication unique to Indian Tribes and their members; 
24
02:10 Apr 02, 2019
H1694
7 
•HR 1694 IH
(5) to clarify the obligations of States and polit-
1
ical subdivisions regarding the provision of trans-
2
lated voting materials for American Indians and 
3
Alaska Natives under section 203 of the Voting 
4
Rights Act of 1965 (52 U.S.C. 10503); 
5
(6) to provide Tribal leaders with a direct path-
6
way to request Federal election observers, and to 
7
allow public access to the reports of those election 
8
observers; and 
9
(7) to direct the Department of Justice to con-

related to voting.
