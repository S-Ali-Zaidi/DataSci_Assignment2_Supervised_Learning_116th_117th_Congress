RESOLUTION 
Affirming the right of all renters to a safe, affordable, and 
decent home. 
Whereas housing is a basic human right; 
Whereas evidence-based research has shown that families 
with safe, decent, and affordable homes are better able 
to find employment, achieve economic mobility, perform 
better in school, and maintain improved health; 
Whereas providing housing assistance is one of the most ef-
fective ways to help families, children, and youth escape 
poverty and domestic violence and to prevent homeless-
ness; 
Whereas investing in affordable housing infrastructure has 
numerous benefits for the economy, including creating

jobs, boosting families’ incomes, promoting healthy fami-
lies, and encouraging further development; 
Whereas far too many families living in urban, suburban, and 
rural communities struggle to afford their rent each 
month, putting them at increased risk of eviction and 
homelessness; 
Whereas people of color, especially single Black and Latina 
mothers, experience disparate rates of eviction; 
Whereas according to the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development (HUD) point-in-time count of 2018, there 
were over 553,000 people in the United States experi-
encing homelessness on any given night, including over 
110,000 children; 
Whereas homelessness has become so pervasive that some 
States and cities have declared that homelessness has 
reached a state of emergency; 
Whereas people experiencing homelessness are more likely to 
be the victims of violent crimes and face dehumanizing 
conditions; 
Whereas major progress toward the national goals for ending 
homelessness in our Nation has stalled in the absence of 
increased funding; 
Whereas a shortage of affordable housing exists in every 
State and major metropolitan area; 
Whereas a full-time worker earning the Federal minimum 
wage cannot afford a modest two-bedroom apartment in 
any State, metropolitan area, or county in the United 
States; 
Whereas over half of all renters are cost-burdened, paying 
more than 30 percent of their income for housing, and

71 percent of extremely low-income households are se-
verely cost-burdened, paying more than half of their in-
come for housing; 
Whereas rapidly rising rents across the country have pushed 
many long-time residents and families out of the commu-
nities they call home; 
Whereas 3 out of every 4 families in need of housing assist-
ance are turned away due to chronic underfunding; 
Whereas the role of Federal affordable housing investment is 
even more important given the limited ability of the pri-
vate market alone to address these needs; 
Whereas various programs at the Department of Housing 
and Urban Development provide Federal rental assist-
ance, which helps about 10,000,000 people, including 
nearly 4,000,000 children and more than 4,000,000 low- 
income families, and such programs include the Public 
Housing program, the section 8 Housing Choice Vouch-
ers (HCV) program, the section 8 Project-Based Rental 
Assistance program, the section 202 Supportive Housing 
for the Elderly program, the section 811 Supportive 
Housing for Persons with Disabilities program, and the 
Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) 
program; 
Whereas despite leveraging billions of dollars in private re-
sources to preserve and expand the supply of affordable 
housing, affordable housing programs continue to be 
chronically underfunded despite their success at providing 
safe housing to families in need; 
Whereas chronic underfunding of the Public Housing Capital 
Fund has led to a backlog of up to $70,000,000,000 in 
capital repairs and deteriorating conditions for residents;

Whereas without Federal investments, many more families 
would be homeless, living in substandard or overcrowded 
conditions, or struggling to meet other basic needs be-
cause too much of their limited income would be used to 
pay rent; 
Whereas low Federal spending caps required by the Budget 
Control Act of 2011 (Public Law 112–25) have decreased 
funding for affordable housing and community develop-
ment programs; 
Whereas these austere spending caps threaten affordable 
housing and community development for millions of low- 
income families; 
Whereas even renters with housing subsidies often face bar-
riers to finding housing providers willing to rent to them; 
Whereas under current Federal law, housing discrimination 
against a renter is illegal if it is based on race, color, reli-
gion, sex, familial status, national origin, or disability; 
Whereas 68,000,000 Americans believe they have been treat-
ed differently in their search for housing based on their 
race, color, religion, sex, familial status, national origin, 
or disability; 
Whereas renters and others experiencing housing need should 
be protected against housing discrimination through 
stronger enforcement of fair housing laws; and 
Whereas despite various clarifying guidance from HUD, the 
reentry community continues to face barriers in trying to 
secure access to federally assisted housing: Now, there-
fore, be it
