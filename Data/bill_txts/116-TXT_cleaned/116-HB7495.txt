SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds as follows: 
2
(1) Charitable nonprofit organizations serve on 
3
our society’s frontlines in good times and bad. Col-
4
lectively, nonprofit organizations employ more than 
5
12,000,000 Americans. 
6
(2) As the Nation confronts the coronavirus 
7
pandemic and the attendant economic crisis and re-
8
covery, communities throughout the United States 
9
will rely on nonprofit organizations more than ever 
10
to help more people in more challenging cir-
11
cumstances. 
12
(3) Nonprofit shelters, food banks, domestic vi-
13
olence services, early childhood care and education 
14
centers, and after-school facilities are being called to 
15
feed, house, and care for the people whose lives have 
16
been disrupted by illness, job loss, and closures. 
17
(4) Charitable nonprofit organizations are being 
18
confronted by a combination of contradictory forces: 
19
exponentially increasing demand and devastating de-
20
creases in revenues. 
21
(5) At the same time that need is soaring, 
22
many nonprofit organizations are unable to host 
23
fundraising events, which threatens an essential 
24
source of revenue. Charitable giving has also become 
25

H7495
3 
•HR 7495 IH
more precarious as American families conserve re-
1
sources in the face of the economic crisis. 
2
(6) Without immediate and longer-term re-
3
sources to keep their doors open to meet ever-in-
4
creasing needs, many nonprofit organizations will 
5
cease to exist for people in local communities 
6
throughout the country. 
7
(7) In order to meet the needs of the 
8
coronavirus pandemic and drive recovery, many non-
9
profit organizations must innovate and create new 
10
models of service delivery. 
11
(8) More than 36,000,000 American workers 
12
lost their jobs and filed for unemployment benefits 
13
in the 8 weeks following March 15, 2020. 
14
(9) Providing these newly unemployed workers 
15
the opportunity to find employment at nonprofit or-
16
ganizations in their local communities will benefit 
17
these workers, nonprofit organizations, and the peo-
18
ple these organizations serve.
