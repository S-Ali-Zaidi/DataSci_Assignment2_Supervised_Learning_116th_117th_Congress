Whereas across the United States, clean and readily abun-
dant forms of energy are powering more homes and busi-
nesses than ever before; 
Whereas clean energy generation is readily available from 
zero- and low-emissions sources; 
Whereas the clean energy sector is a growing part of the 
economy and has been a key driver of economic growth 
in the United States in recent years; 
Whereas technological innovation can further reduce costs 
and increase deployment of clean energy sources; 
Whereas the ‘‘2020 U.S. Energy and Employment Report’’ 
found that— 
(1) at the end of 2019, the energy sector in the 
United States employed 6,800,000 individuals; and 
(2) in 2019, the energy sector in the United States 
generated more than 120,000 new jobs; 
Whereas the scaling of clean energy is essential to reducing 
harmful pollution; 
Whereas clean energy jobs are inherently local, contribute to 
the growth of local economies, and cannot be outsourced 
due to the on-site nature of construction, installation, 
and maintenance; and 
Whereas innovative clean energy solutions and clean energy 
jobs are part of the energy future of the United States: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the designation of ‘‘National Clean 
2
Energy Week’’;
