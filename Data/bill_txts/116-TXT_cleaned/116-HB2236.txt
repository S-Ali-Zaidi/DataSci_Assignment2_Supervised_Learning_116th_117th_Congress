SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
10
Section 2(a) (16 U.S.C. 1801(a)) is amended by add-
11
ing at the end the following: 
12
‘‘(13) Forage fish are generally small to inter-
13
mediate-sized species, occurring in schools or dense 
14
aggregations, and function as a main pathway for 
15
energy to flow from phyto- and zooplankton to high-
16
er trophic level predators, such as tuna, Alaska pol-
17
lock, and other wildlife, in marine ecosystems. While 
18
most species function as prey of others at some life 
19
stage, especially when small and young, forage fish 
20
maintain this important trophic role throughout 
21
their life. Further, fluctuations in their populations 
22
can result in significant changes in marine commu-
23
nities and ecosystems. Therefore, particular atten-

tion to management of forage fish species, and ad-
1
dressing their unique role in marine ecosystems, is 
2
critical to maintaining ecosystem function and sus-
3
tainable fisheries.’’.
