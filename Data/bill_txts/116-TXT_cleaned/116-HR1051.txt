RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the designation of July 20, 2020, 
as ‘‘National Heroes Day’’ to honor the sacrifices of 
everyday heroes who save lives and improve their commu-
nities. 
Whereas, on July 20, 2012, in Aurora, Colorado, 12 people’s 
lives were taken and so many more were injured, yet we 
saw remarkable acts of bravery in the face of unspeak-
able violence and everyday people risked their lives to 
save countless others; 
Whereas today, during a global pandemic where over 100,000 
Americans have lost their lives, we are witnessing every-
day people again rising up and putting their lives in jeop-
ardy to help others;

Whereas first inspired by the two servicemembers and two ci-
vilians whose lives were taken while shielding others on 
July 20, 2012, we recognize July 20 as ‘‘National Heroes 
Day’’ to honor the sacrifices of everyday heroes who save 
lives and improve their communities; 
Whereas, on July 20, 2012, 12 lives were taken, 70 were 
wounded, and hundreds suffered emotional damage in-
cluding one victim losing a daughter and suffering a mis-
carriage when a gunman opened fire at the Aurora Mall 
Theater; 
Whereas during this heinous act of violence, moviegoers cou-
rageously took immediate action risking their own lives to 
protect and save the lives of others; 
Whereas there are countless other examples of individuals 
stepping up for their communities every day, during cri-
ses, and during natural disasters; 
Whereas the COVID–19 pandemic has called on individuals 
to demonstrate heroism, courage, and initiative to aid 
their communities, including— 
(1) medical professionals providing lifesaving care 
and support to patients in times of need; 
(2) law enforcement, firefighters, emergency re-
sponders, and the National Guard who courageously sup-
port, protect, and care for their fellow citizens; 
(3) frontline workers such as farmers, those at food 
processing and packaging plants, truck drivers, grocery 
workers, sanitation personnel, and those in correctional 
facilities and nursing homes and all other essential work-
ers providing critical services during challenging times; 
(4) teachers providing quality education, encourage-
ment, and support to their students during a global pan-
demic;

(5) journalists who continue to provide critical news 
coverage of global events to the public; 
(6) letter carriers, postal workers, and delivery work-
ers who keep our communities and economies connected; 
(7) small businesses adopting and repurposing their 
facilities to produce medical equipment; 
(8) community members volunteering their time and 
resources to support and care for their neighbors; and 
(9) all those who have lost family and loved ones to 
the pandemic and who have been unable to grieve to-
gether as they mourn their loss; and 
Whereas the American people have always courageously an-
swered the call to save lives, persevered to find cures, 
fought bravely for others, and set a shining example for 
generations to come: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) recognizes, commends, and honors the self-

less dedication to fellow citizens displayed through

heroic actions across the country;

(2) calls upon the Members of the House of
