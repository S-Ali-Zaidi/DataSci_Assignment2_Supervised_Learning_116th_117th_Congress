Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS. 
3
(a) SHORT TITLE.—This Act may be cited as the 
4
‘‘Social Security and Medicare Lock-Box Act’’. 
5
(b) FINDINGS REGARDING SOCIAL SECURITY AND 
6
MEDICARE PART A.—The Congress finds the following: 
7
(1)(A) Long-term projections show serious 
8
problems facing the fiscal health of the trust funds 
9
associated with Social Security and Medicare Hos-
10
pital Insurance. 
11
(B) According to the 2018 Annual Report of 
12
the Board of Trustees of the Federal Old-Age and 
13
Survivors Insurance and Federal Disability Insur-
14
ance Trust Funds, the assets of the combined Fed-
15
eral Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund 
16
and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund 
17
will be exhausted by 2034, and the Disability Insur-
18
ance Trust Fund alone will be depleted by 2032. 
19
(C) According to the 2018 Annual Report of 
20
the Board of Trustees of the Federal Hospital In-
21
surance and Federal Supplementary Medical Insur-

•HR 1215 IH
ance Trust Funds, the assets of the Federal Hos-
1
pital Insurance Trust Fund will be exhausted by 
2
2026. 
3
(2)(A) The Trustees of these trust funds 
4
strongly encourage action to protect the solvency of 
5
the trust funds. 
6
(B) In their message to the public, included in 
7
the 2018 Annual Reports, the Social Security and 
8
Medicare Boards of Trustees wrote, ‘‘The Trustees 
9
recommend that lawmakers address the projected 
10
trust fund shortfalls in a timely way in order to 
11
phase in necessary changes gradually and give work-
12
ers and beneficiaries time to adjust to them. Imple-
13
menting changes sooner rather than later would 
14
allow more generations to share in the needed rev-
15
enue increases or reductions in scheduled benefits 
16
and could preserve more trust fund reserves to help 
17
finance future benefits. Social Security will play a 
18
critical role in the lives of 63 million beneficiaries 
19
and 175 million covered workers and their families 
20
during 2018. With informed discussion, creative 
21
thinking, and timely legislative action, Social Secu-
22
rity can continue to protect future generations.’’.

(3) Social Security and Medicare are meant to 
1
provide a secure and stable base so that older Amer-
2
icans can live in dignity. 
3
(4) Protecting the future surpluses of these 
4
trust funds can only occur when meaningful reform 
5
has been enacted by Congress. Any path to solvency 
6
must include the protection of future surpluses.
