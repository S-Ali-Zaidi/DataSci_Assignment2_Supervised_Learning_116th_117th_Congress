A BILL 
To amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to strengthen 
prevention and response measures for hate crimes on 
college campuses by establishing robust accountability 
measures, providing needs-based grants, and amending 
the Clery Act. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
3
Congress finds the following: 
4
(1) The incidence of violence motivated by the 
5
actual or perceived race, color, religion, national ori-
6
gin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or 
7
disability of the victim, known as hate crimes or 
8
crimes motivated by bias, poses a serious national 
9
problem. 
10
(2) Such violence motivated by hatred and big-
11
otry endangers our citizens and disrupts the commu-
12
nities they live in, by tearing at the fabric of our 
13
Nation and our constitutional aspiration to create a 
14
stronger, more perfect union. 
15
(3) According to data obtained by the Southern 
16
Poverty Law Center, schools were a particularly 
17
common location for hate crimes to occur—including 
18
150 incidents on college campuses in 33 States since 
19
November. 
20
(4) This level of violence demonstrates an un-
21
precedented escalation in race and hate-based crime 
22
being committed on college campuses compared to 
23
recent years. 
24

•HR 761 IH
(5) Hate groups have openly declared their ef-
1
forts to establish a physical presence on college cam-
2
puses and have specifically targeted young individ-
3
uals and students for their messaging. Such efforts 
4
include placing fliers around campus, online orga-
5
nizing, and bringing national leaders to speak. 
6
(6) College campuses have become the ideal lo-
7
cation for hate group activity because they tradition-
8
ally embrace diversity, tolerance, and social justice 
9
and strive for equality and have created safe spaces 
10
for students of every gender and identity. 
11
(7) These are soft targets for such groups, be-
12
cause students are more curious and receptive to 
13
new, even radical, ideas than older individuals. 
14
(8) The Higher Education Act of 1965 and the 
15
Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy 
16
and Campus Crime Statistics Act have enabled Fed-
17
eral authorities to understand, report, and where ap-
18
propriate, investigate and prosecute hate crimes 
19
committed within the jurisdiction of an institution of 
20
higher education. 
21
(9) However, an enduring effort cannot be 
22
made to address the national problem posed by hate 
23
crimes if many of our institutions of higher edu-
24
cation fail to properly evaluate, prepare, and imple-

ment an effective strategy to prevent and respond to 
1
such crimes. 
2
(10) The annual dissemination of relevant in-
3
formation to students and faculty regarding the in-
4
stitution’s campus safety apparatus will provide for 
5
a more transparent and informed campus commu-
6
nity on the infrastructure and process in place, and 
7
the assistance services available. 
8
(11) Federal financial assistance with regard to 
9
providing training, technical assistance, evaluation, 
10
and other associated services will allow school secu-
11
rity and administration to understand the unique 
12
needs for the campus and the assistance to imple-
13
ment the proper safety plan to address those needs. 
14
(12) Amending the Program Participation 
15
Agreement between an institution of higher edu-
16
cation and the Department of Education to include 
17
hate crime programs provides substantial assurance 
18
that campus climate and safety will become an in-
19
creasing priority and focal point to the higher edu-
20
cation community. 
21
(13) Modifying the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of 
22
Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statis-
23
tics Act will enable campus security and local law 
24
enforcement to more efficiently collaborate in detail-

ing and recording information on crimes, including 
1
violence motivated by the actual or perceived race, 
2
color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual ori-
3
entation, gender identity, or disability of the victim. 
4
(14) The problem of crimes motivated by bias 
5
is sufficiently serious, widespread, and interstate in 
6
nature as to warrant Federal financial assistance to 
7
States and local jurisdictions.
