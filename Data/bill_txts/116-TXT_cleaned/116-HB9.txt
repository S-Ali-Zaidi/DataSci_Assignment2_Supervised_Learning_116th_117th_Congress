Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Climate Action Now

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) In Paris, on December 12, 2015, parties to 
8
the United Nations Framework Convention on Cli-
9
mate Change (UNFCCC) reached a landmark agree-
10
ment to combat climate change and to accelerate 
11
and intensify the actions and investments needed for 
12
a sustainable low carbon future. 
13
(2) The Paris Agreement’s central aim is to 
14
strengthen the global response to the threat of cli-
15
mate change by keeping a global temperature rise 
16
well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial lev-
17
els and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature in-
18
crease even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius. 
19
(3) The Paris Agreement requires all parties to 
20
put forward their best efforts through nationally de-
21
termined contributions (NDCs) and to strengthen 
22
these efforts in the years ahead.

(4) The Paris Agreement further requires each 
1
party to update its nationally determined contribu-
2
tion every 5 years, with each successive nationally 
3
determined contribution representing a progression 
4
beyond the previous nationally determined contribu-
5
tion, and reflecting the party’s highest possible am-
6
bition. 
7
(5) The United States communicated its nation-
8
ally determined contribution to achieve an economy- 
9
wide target of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions 
10
by 26 to 28 percent below its 2005 level in 2025 and 
11
to make best efforts to reduce its emissions by 28 
12
percent. 
13
(6) A number of existing laws, regulations, and 
14
other mandatory measures in the United States are 
15
relevant to achieving this target, including the Clean 
16
Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.), the Energy Policy 
17
Act of 1992 (Public Law 102–486), and the Energy 
18
Independence and Security Act of 2007 (Public Law 
19
110–140). 
20
(7) On June 1, 2017, President Trump an-
21
nounced his intention to withdraw the United States 
22
from the Paris Agreement, which would leave the 
23
United States as the only UNFCCC member state 
24
that is not a signatory to the Paris Agreement.

commitments under the Paris Agreement, such as 
5
continuing to report its emissions to the United Na-
6
tions.

10

are authorized to be appropriated, obligated, or expended 
12
to take any action to advance the withdrawal of the United 
13
States from the Paris Agreement.
