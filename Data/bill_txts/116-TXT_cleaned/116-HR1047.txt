RESOLUTION 
Condemning the statements of Representative Ilhan Omar 
of Minnesota. 
Whereas, on July 7, 2020, Representative Ilhan Omar of 
Minnesota said, ‘‘We are not merely fighting to tear 
down the systems of oppression in the criminal justice 
system. We are fighting to tear down systems of oppres-
sion that exist in housing, in education, in healthcare, in 
employment, in the air we breathe.’’; 
Whereas Representative Ilhan Omar continued, ‘‘As long as 
our economy and political systems prioritize profit with-
out considering who is profiting, who is being shut out 
we will perpetuate this inequality. We cannot stop at the 
criminal justice system, we must begin the work of dis-

mantling the whole system of oppression wherever we 
find it’’; 
Whereas Representative Ilhan Omar has a documented his-
tory of expressing anti-American sentiments; 
Whereas Representative Ilhan Omar and other Members of 
Congress continue to advocate for a Marxist form of gov-
ernment that is incompatible with the principles laid out 
in the founding documents of the United States; 
Whereas Karl Marx wrote in the Communist Manifesto that 
‘‘[w]hen in the course of development, class distinctions 
have disappeared, and all production has been con-
centrated in the hands of a vast association of the whole 
nation, the public power will lose its political character. 
Political power, properly so called, is merely the orga-
nized power of one class for oppressing another’’; 
Whereas Marxism, in calling for the abolition of private prop-
erty, does not represent equality or inspire justice, and 
is diametrically opposed to the sensible bounds that the 
Framers of the Constitution established; 
Whereas individuals throughout the world living under Marx-
ist form of governments and a centrally planned economy 
experience unparalleled oppression and brutality at the 
hands of their governments; 
Whereas these experiences show that the imposition of regu-
lations by government over economic and noneconomic 
decisions kill our free society; 
Whereas these experiences demonstrate that the centraliza-
tion of government power always produces the loss of 
freedom; 
Whereas the history of Marxism demonstrates the wisdom of 
the Founders’ understanding that no form of government

can successfully control a system as complex as the free 
market; 
Whereas the United States—despite its imperfect history— 
remains a beacon of hope and human liberty for millions 
across the world due to the freedoms and liberties af-
forded to the people and the system of limited govern-
ment established under the Constitution; and 
Whereas Members of Congress, in calling for the dismantling 
of this system of government and supplanting it with a 
Marxist form of government, are willfully and inten-
tionally violating their oath to ‘‘support and defend the 
Constitution of the United States’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) condemns the statements of Representative

Ilhan Omar of Minnesota; 
3
(2) condemns Members of Congress who advo-

cate for Marxist policies; and

(3) reaffirms its commitment to support and

defend the Constitution of the United States.
