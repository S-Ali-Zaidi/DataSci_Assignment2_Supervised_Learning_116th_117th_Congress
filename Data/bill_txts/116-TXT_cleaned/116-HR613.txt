Whereas the Department of Housing and Urban Develop-
ment (HUD) is responsible for safeguarding and serving 
the most vulnerable among us; 
Whereas the Secretary of HUD, Benjamin S. Carson, Sr., 
made statements to HUD employees in San Francisco re-
garding transgender people; 
Whereas in those statements, Secretary Carson referred to 
transgender women as ‘‘big, hairy men’’ and accused 
them of pretending to be women to access women’s shel-
ters; 
Whereas those statements are incredibly disrespectful and re-
flect bigoted, outdated thinking that is both offensive and 
counterproductive to the mission of the agency; 
Whereas the Washington Post has reported that Secretary 
Carson has ‘‘repeatedly mocked transgender people in in-
ternal meetings in Washington’’; 
Whereas it is the responsibility of the Secretary of HUD, an 
agency with more than 8,000 employees, to ensure a wel-
coming work environment that fosters productivity on be-
half of the American people; 
Whereas the Secretary’s comments and cavalier attitude to-
ward those that HUD is supposed to help has created a 
divisive and demoralizing atmosphere which does not best 
serve the American people; 
Whereas a HUD employee was reportedly applauded as she 
walked out in protest from Secretary Carson’s remarks; 
Whereas these most recent comments are not the first actions 
that Secretary Carson has taken that show a basic dis-
respect toward LGBTQ people;

Whereas, in 2015, then-Presidential candidate Carson said, 
‘‘I do not appreciate using our military as a laboratory 
for social experimentation. The last thing we need to be 
doing is saying, ‘What would it be like if we introduced 
several transgender people into this platoon?’ Give me a 
break. Deal with the transgender thing somewhere else.’’; 
Whereas, in 2016, then-Presidential candidate Carson said, 
‘‘Boys who say, ‘I feel like a girl today, I want to go into 
the girl’s lavatory’—that is such a bunch of garbage. If 
we continue to cater to that, where will it lead? Where 
will it lead us to be? I mean, it’s beyond ridiculous that 
you take the most abnormal situation and then you make 
everyone else conform to it . . . when we start trying to 
impose the extra rights based on a few people who per-
haps are abnormal, where does that lead?’’; 
Whereas, in 2017, HUD removed resource documents de-
signed to help emergency homeless shelters and other 
housing providers comply with HUD nondiscrimination 
policies regarding LGBT service recipients; 
Whereas despite repeated interactions with Congress, both in 
hearings and otherwise, HUD left this guidance in limbo 
for nearly two years before finally announcing, with flim-
sy justification, it would not repost or replace it at all; 
Whereas, in May of 2019, Secretary Carson testified in front 
of the Financial Services Committee of the House of 
Representatives that HUD had no intention of elimi-
nating the crucial Equal Access Rule one day before 
HUD proposed a new rule that would essentially gut it;

Whereas Secretary Carson seems committed to ensuring that 
LGBT individuals are unable to exercise even the basic 
rights afforded to all Americans: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) believes that every American, regardless of 
2
religion, race, gender identity sexual orientation, or 
3
any other classification, deserves access to safe and 
4
secure shelter; 
5
(2) questions the ability and commitment of 
6
Secretary Carson to effectively lead the Department 
7
of Housing and Urban Development and its thou-
8
sands of dedicated employees; and 
9
(3) strongly condemns Secretary Carson’s big-
10
oted comments regarding transgender people and de-
11
cries HUD’s continued effort, under Secretary Car-
12
son’s leadership, to single out and discriminate 
13
against LGBTQ individuals.
