Congress finds the following:

•HR 5276 IH
(1) The Government of Iraq responded to the 
1
protests 
in 
Baghdad, 
Babil, 
Basra, 
Maysan, 
2
Nasiriya, Karbala, and Najaf from October 1 
3
through November 2019, by using unprecedented re-
4
pressive measures against protestors that included 
5
shootings, sniper fire, illegal and unlawful detention, 
6
mass arrests, and weaponizing public services such 
7
as electricity and the internet. 
8
(2) The United Nations Assistance Mission for 
9
Iraq, under United Nations Security Council Resolu-
10
tion 2470 (2019), states that 149 people were killed 
11
in early October and another 97 between October 25 
12
and November 6, 2019, while over 6,100 civilians 
13
have been wounded during the suppression of these 
14
protests. These human rights violations and abuses 
15
resulted due to excessive force against protestors by 
16
Iraqi Security Forces. 
17
(3) Since 2017, Iraqi Security Forces aligned 
18
with the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), pre-
19
dominantly Shi’ite militias frequently backed by 
20
Iran, have committed unlawful and arbitrary killings 
21
according to the United States Department of State. 
22
Some reports indicate that PMF-aligned fighters 
23
were behind the roof-top sniper attacks in Baghdad 
24
in early October 2019 targeting protestors. Iraqi po-

lice also fired military grade tear gas grenades which 
1
lodged in protestors bodies. On October 8, 2019, the 
2
Iraqi military acknowledged the excessive use of 
3
force. 
4
(4) The Iraqi government also suppressed free-
5
dom of expression during the protests through the 
6
detention of journalists, blocking internet access 
7
from October 3 through 9, 2019, and again since 
8
late October, and attacking media outlets. These at-
9
tacks included intimidation, harassment, and pre-
10
paring journalist watchlists while also raiding sat-
11
ellite television stations in Baghdad. 
12
(5) The Commander of the Iranian Quds Force 
13
traveled to Iraq in October 2019 and met with mili-
14
tia leaders from the PMF. The PMF report to the 
15
Iraqi Prime Minister but many units maintain a 
16
command structure outside the formal military chain 
17
of command linked directly to the Iranian Revolu-
18
tionary Guard Corps. The PMF and the Iranian 
19
Revolutionary Guard Corps established a joint oper-
20
ational cell in Baghdad on October 3, 2019, that 
21
may have directly contributed to the use of excessive 
22
force and snipers. 
23
(6) The 2018 Country Reports on Human 
24
Rights Practices of the Department of State found 
25

•HR 5276 IH
that ‘‘civilian authorities did not maintain effective 
1
control over some elements of the security forces, 
2
particularly certain units of the Popular Mobilization 
3
Forces (PMF) that were aligned with Iran’’. 
4
(7) The Government of Iran continues to inter-
5
vene and maintain influence with the militia leaders 
6
and Commanders of the PMF. This undermines the 
7
formal Iraqi chain of command and contributes to 
8
actions by the PMF that use repressive actions 
9
against Iraqi protestors to maintain Iranian proxy 
10
power.
