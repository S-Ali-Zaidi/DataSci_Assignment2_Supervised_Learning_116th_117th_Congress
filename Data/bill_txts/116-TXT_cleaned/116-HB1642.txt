SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
10
Congress makes the following findings: 
11
(1) The illicit trade in tobacco products or their 
12
precursors is a multibillion dollar business that fuels 
13
organized crime, fosters public corruption, under-
14
mines public health goals, and finances terrorist 
15
groups that threaten global security and stability. 
16
(2) According to an estimate by the World 
17
Health Organization, one in every 10 cigarettes 
18
smoked is illegal. 
19
(3) The Center for Public Integrity states, 
20
‘‘while one 40-foot container of cigarettes (con-
21
taining 10 million sticks) can be produced in China 
22
for just $100,000, the street value of such a con-
23
tainer smuggled into the United States is up to $2 
24
million.’’. 
25
03:53 Mar 22, 2019
H1642

•HR 1642 IH
(4) According to the International Criminal Po-
1
lice Organization (commonly known as ‘‘Interpol’’), 
2
the trade in illicit cigarettes accounts for 11.6 per-
3
cent 
of 
global 
consumption, 
equaling 
4
657,000,000,000 cigarettes a year. 
5
(5) According to the Department of State re-
6
port entitled ‘‘The Global Illicit Trade in Tobacco: 
7
A Threat to National Security’’, cigarette smuggling 
8
enables corruption and undermines good governance. 
9
(6) According to that Department of State re-
10
port, illicit trade in tobacco products or their precur-
11
sors costs governments and taxpayers between 
12
$40,000,000,000 and $50,000,000,000 annually in 
13
tax revenues. 
14
(7) According to that Department of State re-
15
port, the illicit trade in tobacco products or their 
16
precursors facilitates other crimes and provides 
17
funding for additional criminal activities, including 
18
money laundering, bulk cash smuggling, and the 
19
trafficking in humans, weapons, drugs, antiquities, 
20
diamonds, and counterfeit goods. 
21
(8) The report entitled ‘‘Illicit Trade: Con-
22
verging Criminal Networks’’ by the Organisation for 
23
Economic Co-operation and Development stated that 
24
cigarettes present a high-profit margin and are 
25
03:53 Mar 22, 2019
H1642

•HR 1642 IH
among the most commonly traded products on the 
1
black market due to the relative ease of production 
2
and movement, along with low detection rates and 
3
penalties. 
4
(9) According to the Department of State re-
5
port entitled, ‘‘The Global Illicit Trade in Tobacco: 
6
A Threat to National Security’’, illicit trade in to-
7
bacco products or their precursors can be transna-
8
tional, with proceeds earned domestically and sent 
9
overseas to finance attacks against United States in-
10
terests, or earned domestically by foreign actors who 
11
can operate more easily from within the country. 
12
(10) The Center for the Analysis of Terrorism 
13
reports that nearly 15 terrorist organizations 
14
throughout the world regularly have recourse in 
15
large proportions to smuggling and counterfeiting 
16
cigarettes to be financed, in particular the Pakistani 
17
Taliban, Lashkar-E–Taiba, Al-Qaida au Maghreb 
18
Islamique, Hezbollah, Hamas, the Revolutionary 
19
Armed Forces of Colombia, the Kurdistan Workers’ 
20
Party, Euskadi Ta Askatasuna, and the Irish Re-
21
publican Army.
