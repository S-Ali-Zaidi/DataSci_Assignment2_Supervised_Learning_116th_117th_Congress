SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Federal Funding Ac-
2
countability for Sexual Harassers Act’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
4
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) Discrimination on the basis of sex remains 
6
pervasive in the academic workplace and especially 
7
in the fields of science, engineering, and medicine. 
8
(2) According to a study conducted by the Na-
9
tional Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Med-
10
icine in 2018— 
11
(A) academic workplaces have a rate of 
12
sexual harassment equal to 58 percent, which is 
13
second only to the military, which has a rate of 
14
sexual harassment equal to 69 percent; 
15
(B) more than 50 percent of female faculty 
16
and staff and an estimated 20 to 50 percent of 
17
female students encounter or experience sexual 
18
harassment in academia; 
19
(C) in a survey of undergraduate and 
20
graduate students, 1 in 5 female science stu-
21
dents, 1 in 4 female engineering students, and 
22
2 in 5 female medical students experienced sex-
23
ual harassment from faculty and staff; 
24

•HR 5328 IH
(D) with respect to sexual harassment, 
1
sexual and racial minorities are disproportion-
2
ately targeted; 
3
(E) in a study of employees in higher edu-
4
cation, nearly 77 percent of sexual minorities of 
5
both genders experienced gender harassment 
6
compared to 30 percent of heterosexuals; 
7
(F) women of color and racial or ethnic 
8
minorities experience harassment differently 
9
from other populations given their intersectional 
10
identities; and 
11
(G) policies and procedures in effect as of 
12
the date of enactment of this Act often protect 
13
the liability of institutions of higher education 
14
but are not effective in preventing sexual har-
15
assment. 
16
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
17
gress that academic institutions and the Federal Govern-
18
ment should work together to meaningfully address the 
19
issue of sexual harassment by ensuring a culture of ac-
20
countability, transparency, and inclusion.
