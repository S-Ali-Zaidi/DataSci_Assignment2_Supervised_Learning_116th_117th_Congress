SEC. 1002. DEFINITIONS. 
12
In this title: 
13
(1) CHRONIC
WASTING
DISEASE.—The term 
14
‘‘chronic wasting disease’’ means the animal disease 
15
afflicting among deer, elk, and moose populations 
16
that— 
17
(A) is a transmissible disease of the nerv-
18
ous system resulting in distinctive lesions in the 
19
brain; and 
20
(B) belongs to the group of diseases known 
21
as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, 
22
which group includes scrapie, bovine spongiform 
23
encephalopathy, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. 
24
(2) ELIGIBLE
GRANT
RECIPIENT.—The term 
25
‘‘eligible grant recipient’’ means a State department 
26

•HR 1326 IH
of wildlife, State department of agriculture, college 
1
or university, or related research center conducting 
2
scientific applied research regarding chronic wasting 
3
disease. 
4
(3) INDIAN TRIBE.—The term ‘‘Indian Tribe’’ 
5
has the meaning given the term in section 4 of the 
6
Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance 
7
Act (25 U.S.C. 450b). 
8
(4) SECRETARY.—The term ‘‘Secretary’’ means 
9
the Secretary of Agriculture, acting through the Ani-
10
mal and Plant Health Inspection Service-Wildlife 
11
Services. 
12
SEC. 1003. FINDINGS. 
13
Congress finds the following: 
14
(1) Pursuant to State and Federal law, the 
15
States retain primary and policymaking authority 
16
with regard to wildlife management, and nothing in 
17
this title interferes with or otherwise affects the pri-
18
mary authority of the States in managing wildlife 
19
generally, or managing, surveying, and monitoring 
20
the incidence of chronic wasting disease. 
21
(2) Chronic wasting disease, the fatal neuro-
22
logical disease found in cervids, is a fundamental 
23
threat to the health and vibrancy of deer, elk, and 
24
moose populations, and the increased occurrence of 
25
19:57 Mar 05, 2019
H1326
85 
•HR 1326 IH
chronic wasting disease in regionally diverse loca-
1
tions in recent months necessitates an escalation in 
2
applied research, surveillance, monitoring, and man-
3
agement activities focused on containing and man-
4
aging this lethal disease. 
5
(3) As the States move to manage existing lev-
6
els of chronic wasting disease and insulate non-
7
infected wild and captive cervid populations from the 
8
disease, the Federal Government should endeavor to 
9
provide integrated and holistic financial and tech-
10
nical support to these States and the many State de-
11
partments of wildlife, State departments of agri-
12
culture, colleges and universities, and related re-
13
search centers conducting scientific applied research 
14
regarding chronic wasting disease. 
15
(4) The Secretary should provide consistent, co-
16
herent, and integrated support structures and pro-
17
grams for the benefit of State wildlife and agricul-
18
tural administrators, as chronic wasting disease can 
19
move freely between captive and wild cervids across 
20
the broad array of Federal, State, Tribal, and local 
21
land management jurisdictions. 
22
(5) The Secretary can provide consistent, coher-
23
ent, and integrated support systems under existing 
24
legal authorities to States and the many State de-

•HR 1326 IH
SEC. 1102. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress makes the following findings: 
2
(1) Chronic wasting disease continues to spread 
3
in wild, free-ranging cervid herds and in captive 
4
cervid herds across the United States and Canada, 
5
and as of December 2018, is in 26 States and three 
6
Canadian provinces. 
7
(2) From December 2017 to December 2018 
8
alone, the disease was detected for the first time in 
9
free-ranging cervid herds in Mississippi, Montana, 
10
and Tennessee, and there were new positive detec-
11
tions of the disease in 13 captive cervid herds from 
12
Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, 
13
Wisconsin, and Quebec, Canada. 
14
(3) Six of such herds are being monitored by 
15
the National Chronic Wasting Disease Herd Certifi-
16
cation Program of the Animal and Plant Health In-
17
spection Service, and therefore are considered to be 
18
at low risk for chronic wasting disease. 
19
(4) From June 2017 to September 2018, 10 
20
States, including Arkansas, Illinois, Kansas, Min-
21
nesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Texas, West Virginia, 
22
Wisconsin, and Wyoming, are already fighting to 
23
control the transmission and spread of chronic wast-
24
ing disease and found positive detections for the dis-
25
ease in additional wild, free-ranging cervid herds. 
26
19:57 Mar 05, 2019
H1326
92 
•HR 1326 IH
(5) New positive detections in captive cervid 
1
herds were found in Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, 
2
Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. 
3
(6) There is no known cure for chronic wasting 
4
disease, no reliable live animal test to detect the dis-
5
ease, and only a post-mortem test that provides 
6
some measure of reliable detection of the disease. 
7
(7) Chronic wasting disease is 100 percent fatal 
8
and is arguably the most important disease threat-
9
ening North American cervid resources. 
10
(8) The spread of chronic wasting disease con-
11
tinues to increasingly and adversely affect the eco-
12
nomic well-being of rural communities, the hunting 
13
public, farmed cervid producers, and State wildlife 
14
and agricultural agencies, because the only known 
15
measure for reducing the spread of chronic wasting 
16
disease is the complete depopulation of herds that 
17
test positive for the disease, a drastic measure which 
18
comes with great costs for all. 
19
(9) The long-term environmental persistence of 
20
chronic wasting disease’s causative agent means that 
21
State wildlife management agencies, State depart-
22
ments of agriculture, and private cervid farmers 
23
have relatively few options to mitigate the effects of 
24
such disease. 
25

•HR 1326 IH
(10) There are ongoing debates about the pre-
1
dominant transmission pathways that are causing

the new detections and continued spread of chronic

4
and Canada.

(1) IN GENERAL.—The Secretaries shall enter 
9
into an arrangement with the Academy under which 
10
the Academy shall conduct, and submit to the Secre-
11
taries a report— 
12
(A) describing the findings of, a special re-
13
source study to identify the predominant path-
14
ways and mechanisms of the transmission of 
15
chronic wasting disease in wild, captive, and 
16
farmed populations of cervids in the United 
17
States; and 
18
(B) which may include the potential im-
19
pacts on the disease from transmissions from 
20
Canada.

(2) REQUIREMENTS.—The arrangement under 
22
paragraph (1) shall provide that the actual expenses

(b) CONTENTS OF THE STUDY.—Within and between 
3
wild, captive, and farmed cervid populations, the study— 
4
(1) may include, to the extent the United States 
5
is affected on a continental scale, the potential im-
6
pacts on the disease from transmissions from Can-
7
ada; and 
8
(2) shall— 
9
(A) identify— 
10
(i) the pathways and mechanisms for 
11
the transmission of chronic wasting disease 
12
in cervids and cervid products; 
13
(ii) the dosage and infection rates for 
14
each such pathway and mechanism; and 
15
(iii) the relative frequency of each 
16
mode of such transmission; 
17
(B) identify anthropogenic and environ-
18
mental factors contributing to new chronic 
19
wasting disease emergence events, the develop-
20
ment of geographic areas with increased chronic 
21
wasting disease prevalence, and overall geo-
22
graphic patterns of chronic wasting disease dis-

1
entific knowledge regarding the transmission 
2
pathways identified under subparagraph (A); 
3
(D) identify and prioritize scientific re-
4
search projects that will address the knowledge 
5
gaps referred to in subparagraph (C); and 
6
(E) review science-based best practices, 
7
standards, and guidance regarding the manage-
8
ment of chronic wasting disease in wild, captive, 
9
and farmed cervid populations in the United 
10
States which have been developed by—

(ii) the United States Geological Sur-

(iii) State wildlife and agricultural 
18
agencies, which provide practical, science-

based recommendations to State and Fed-
20
eral agencies for minimizing or eliminating 
21
the risk of transmission of chronic wasting 
22
disease in the United States.
