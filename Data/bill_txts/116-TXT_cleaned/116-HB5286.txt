Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

school, and over 70 percent of young people say they 
1
have seen bullying in their schools. 
2
(2) Since most instances of bullying take place 
3
on school grounds, school staff and teachers play an 
4
instrumental role in bullying prevention. 
5
(3) Research shows that engaged educators who 
6
are supportive of all students help to reduce the 
7
overall presence of bullying and harassment on 
8
school grounds. 
9
(4) 87.3 percent of transgender students report 
10
feeling unsafe at school, and nine out of ten stu-
11
dents who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
12
transgender, or queer (LGBTQ) report being har-
13
assed and bullied every year. 
14
(5) Hostile school environments have a detri-
15
mental effect on the academic success and health of 
16
students. 
17
(6) Law in effect before the date of the enact-
18
ment of this Act does not sufficiently address bul-
19
lying prevention, and governments and educators in 
20
every State have a responsibility to ensure State and 
21
local education systems have processes in place for 
22
students to be able to learn in a safe environment, 
23
regardless of their actual or perceived race, color,
