SEC. 2. ESTABLISHMENT OF ACQUISITION PATHWAYS FOR 
1
SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND SOFTWARE 
2
UPGRADES. 
3
(a) GUIDANCE REQUIRED.—Not later than March 1, 
4
2020, the Secretary of Defense shall establish guidance 
5
authorizing the use of acquisition pathways described in 
6
subsection (b) for the rapid acquisition of software appli-
7
cations and software upgrades that are intended to be 
8
fielded within one year. A contract awarded under this sec-
9
tion— 
10
(1) shall be in an amount equal to or less than 
11
$50,000,000; and 
12
(2) may be entered into for a period of not 
13
more than one year. 
14
(b) SOFTWARE ACQUISITION PATHWAYS.—The guid-
15
ance required by subsection (a) shall provide for the use 
16
of the following two acquisition pathways: 
17
(1) APPLICATIONS.—The applications pathway 
18
shall provide for the use of rapid development and 
19
implementation of software applications to be used 
20
with commercially available hardware. 
21
(2) UPGRADES.—The upgrades pathway shall 
22
provide for the rapid development and insertion of 
23

(c) GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.—The guidance re-
1
quired by subsection (a) shall provide for— 
2
(1) the use of proven technologies and solutions 
3
to continuously engineer, update, and deliver capa-
4
bilities in software; and 
5
(2) a streamlined and coordinated require-
6
ments, budget, and acquisition process that results 
7
in the rapid fielding of software applications and 
8
software upgrades. 
9
(d) EXPEDITED PROCESS.— 
10
(1) IN
GENERAL.—An acquisition conducted 
11
under the guidance required by subsection (a) shall 
12
not be subject to the Joint Capabilities Integration 
13
and Development System Manual and Department 
14
of Defense Directive 5000.01, except to the extent 
15
specifically provided in such guidance. 
16
(2) REQUIREMENTS
PROCESS.—The guidance 
17
required by subsection (a) shall provide that the re-
18
quirements for acquisition of software applications 
19
and software upgrades— 
20
(A) are developed, refined, and prioritized 
21
on an iterative basis through continuous partici-
22
pation and collaboration by users, testers, and 
23
requirements authorities;

(B) include an identification of the need 
1
for, and users of, the software to be acquired 
2
and a rationale for how the software will sup-
3
port increased efficiency of the Department of 
4
Defense; 
5
(C) are stated in the form of a summary- 
6
level list of vulnerabilities in existing software 
7
systems and desired features or capabilities of 
8
the software to be acquired; and 
9
(D) consider issues related to lifecycle 
10
costs, systems interoperability, and logistics 
11
support if the developer of the software to be 
12
acquired stops providing support. 
13
(3) EXECUTION OF RAPID ACQUISITIONS.—The 
14
Secretary shall ensure that— 
15
(A) an acquisition conducted under the 
16
guidance required by subsection (a) is sup-
17
ported by an entity capable of regular auto-
18
mated testing of the source code of the software 
19
to be acquired and that such entity is author-
20
ized to buy storage, bandwidth, and computing 
21
capability as necessary; 
22
(B) the Department of Defense can collect 
23
and analyze the testing data described in sub-

Evaluation and the project manager appointed 
4
under paragraph (5) design test cases to ensure 
5
that the entity described in subparagraph (A)

can test the software to be acquired to ensure 
7
such software meets the requirements of the 
8
contract; 
9
(D) the project manager appointed under 
10
paragraph (5) closely monitors the progress of 
11
an acquisition conducted under the guidance re-
12
quired by subsection (a); 
13
(E) an independent cost estimate is con-
14
ducted that considers— 
15
(i) the iterative process of the develop-
16
ment of the software to be acquired; and 
17
(ii) the long-term value of the soft-
18
ware to be acquired to the Department of 
19
Defense, not based on the value of indi-
20
vidual lines of source code of the software; 
21
(F) the performance of fielded versions of 
22
the software to be acquired are demonstrated 
23
and evaluated in an operational environment;

be acquired, such as metrics relating to when 
2
the software can be fielded, delivery capabilities 
3
of the software (including speed of recovery 
4
from outages and cybersecurity vulnerabilities),

(4) ADMINISTRATION OF SOFTWARE ACQUISI-
11
TION PATHWAYS.—The guidance required by sub-
12
section (a) may provide for the use of any of the fol-
13
lowing streamlined procedures: 
14

15
military department concerned shall appoint a 
16
project manager for each acquisition of software 
17
applications and software upgrades, as deter-
18
mined by the service acquisition executive. Such 
19
project manager shall be appointed from among 
20
civilian employees or members of the Armed 
21
Forces who have significant and relevant expe-
22
rience in current software processes. 
23
(B) Each project manager shall report 
24
with respect to such acquisition directly, and

without intervening review or approval, to the 
1
service acquisition executive of the military de-
2
partment concerned. 
3
(C) The service acquisition executive of the 
4
military department concerned shall evaluate 
5
the job performance of such manager on an an-
6
nual basis. In conducting an evaluation under 
7
this paragraph, a service acquisition executive 
8
shall consider the extent to which the manager 
9
has achieved the objectives of the acquisition 
10
for which the manager is responsible, including 
11
quality, timeliness, and cost objectives. 
12
(D) The project manager shall be author-
13
ized staff positions for a technical staff, includ-
14
ing experts in software engineering to enable 
15
the manager to manage the acquisition without 
16
the technical assistance of another organiza-
17
tional unit of an agency to the maximum extent 
18
practicable. 
19
(E) The project manager shall be author-
20
ized, in coordination with the users and testers 
21
of the software to be acquired, to make trade-
22
offs among lifecycle costs, requirements, and 
23
schedules to meet the goals of the acquisition.
