1
Congress makes the following findings: 
2
(1) The stated goal of the United States Inter-
3
national Strategy for Cyberspace, launched on May 
4
16, 2011, is to ‘‘work internationally to promote an 
5
open, interoperable, secure, and reliable information 
6
and communications infrastructure that supports 
7
international trade and commerce, strengthens inter-
8
national security, and fosters free expression and in-
9
novation . . . in which norms of responsible behav-
10
ior guide states’ actions, sustain partnerships, and 
11
support the rule of law in cyberspace’’. 
12
(2) In its June 24, 2013 report, the Group of 
13
Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field 
14
of Information and Telecommunications in the Con-
15
text of International Security (referred to in this 
16
section as ‘‘GGE’’), established by the United Na-
17
tions General Assembly, concluded that ‘‘State sov-
18
ereignty and the international norms and principles 
19
that flow from it apply to States’ conduct of [infor-
20
mation and communications technology] ICT-related 
21
activities and to their jurisdiction over ICT infra-
22
structure with their territory’’.

(3) In January 2015, China, Kazakhstan, 
1
Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan pro-
2
posed a troubling international code of conduct for 
3
information security, which could be used as a pre-
4
text for restricting political dissent, and includes 
5
‘‘curbing the dissemination of information that in-
6
cites terrorism, separatism or extremism or that in-
7
flames hatred on ethnic, racial or religious grounds’’. 
8
(4) In its July 22, 2015 consensus report, GGE 
9
found that ‘‘norms of responsible State behavior can 
10
reduce risks to international peace, security and sta-
11
bility’’. 
12
(5) On September 25, 2015, the United States 
13
and China announced a commitment that neither 
14
country’s government ‘‘will conduct or knowingly 
15
support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property, 
16
including trade secrets or other confidential business 
17
information, with the intent of providing competitive 
18
advantages to companies or commercial sectors’’.

(6) At the Antalya Summit on November 15 
20
and 
16, 
2015, 
the 
Group 
of 
20 
Leaders’ 
21
communique´— 
22

23
national law to state behavior in cyberspace;

•HR 739 IH
(B) called on states to refrain from cyber- 
1
enabled theft of intellectual property for com-
2
mercial gain; and 
3
(C) endorsed the view that all states 
4
should abide by norms of responsible behavior. 
5
(7) The March 2016 Department of State 
6
International Cyberspace Policy Strategy noted that 
7
‘‘the Department of State anticipates a continued in-
8
crease and expansion of our cyber-focused diplomatic 
9
efforts for the foreseeable future’’. 
10
(8) On December 1, 2016, the Commission on 
11
Enhancing National Cybersecurity, which was estab-
12
lished within the Department of Commerce by Exec-
13
utive Order 13718 (81 Fed. Reg. 7441), rec-
14
ommended that ‘‘the President should appoint an 
15
Ambassador for Cybersecurity to lead U.S. engage-
16
ment with the international community on cyberse-
17
curity strategies, standards, and practices’’. 
18
(9) On April 11, 2017, the 2017 Group of 7 
19
Declaration on Responsible States Behavior in 
20
Cyberspace— 
21
(A) recognized ‘‘the urgent necessity of in-
22
creased international cooperation to promote se-
23
curity and stability in cyberspace’’; 
24

•HR 739 IH
(B) expressed commitment to ‘‘promoting 
1
a strategic framework for conflict prevention, 
2
cooperation and stability in cyberspace, con-
3
sisting of the recognition of the applicability of 
4
existing international law to State behavior in 
5
cyberspace, the promotion of voluntary, non- 
6
binding norms of responsible State behavior 
7
during peacetime, and the development and the 
8

10
and 
11
(C) reaffirmed that ‘‘the same rights that 
12
people have offline must also be protected on-
13

(10) In testimony before the Select Committee 
15
on Intelligence of the Senate on May 11, 2017, Di-
16
rector of National Intelligence Daniel R. Coats iden-
17
tified 6 cyber threat actors, including— 
18
(A) Russia, for ‘‘efforts to influence the 
19
2016 US election’’; 
20
(B) China, for ‘‘actively targeting the US 
21
Government, its allies, and US companies for

(E) terrorists, who ‘‘use the Internet to or-
7
ganize, recruit, spread propaganda, raise funds, 
8
collect intelligence, inspire action by followers, 
9
and coordinate operations’’; and 
10
(F) criminals, who ‘‘are also developing 
11
and using sophisticated cyber tools for a variety 
12
of purposes including theft, extortion, and fa-
13
cilitation of other criminal activities’’. 
14
(11) On May 11, 2017, President Donald J. 
15
Trump issued Executive Order 13800 (82 Fed. Reg. 
16
22391), entitled ‘‘Strengthening the Cybersecurity of 
17
Federal Networks and Infrastructure’’, which— 
18
(A) designates the Secretary of State to 
19
lead an interagency effort to develop an engage-
20
ment strategy for international cooperation in 
21
cybersecurity; and 
22
(B) notes that ‘‘the United States is espe-
