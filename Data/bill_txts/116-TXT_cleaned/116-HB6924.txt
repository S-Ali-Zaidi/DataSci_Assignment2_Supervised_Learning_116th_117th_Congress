SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Prize competitions have been used through-
3
out America’s history, dating back to the designing 
4
of the United States Capitol Building in 1792. 
5
(2) The America COMPETES Reauthorization 
6
Act of 2010 granted authority for Federal agencies 
7
to carry out prize competitions in order to stimulate 
8
innovation to advance each agency’s mission. 
9
(3) Prize competitions provide a benefit to the 
10
American people by providing a high reward return 
11
on taxpayer dollars. 
12
(4) Since 2010, Federal agencies have con-
13
ducted nearly 1,000 prize competitions to help ad-
14
dress some of our Nation’s greatest challenges. 
15
(5) In order to mitigate the spread of COVID– 
16
19, Americans needs access to rapid diagnostic test-
17
ing in their homes. 
18
(6) At-home infectious disease tests provide re-
19
sults in real time, rather than in hours or days. 
20
(7) Infectious disease tests are useful in re-
21
source-limited situations where there may not be ac-
22
cess to a central laboratory or where infrastructure 
23

(8) Although other Federal agencies are cur-
1
rently involved in supporting and conducting re-
2
search into at-home testing, research spurred by 
3
prize competitions at the National Institutes of 
4
Health in consultation with the National Institute of 
5
Standards and Technology can have broader benefits 
6
for the American public. 
7
(9) The National Institute of Standards and 
8
Technology, due to its expertise in materials meas-
9
urement, including for DNA and other biological 
10
materials, is well positioned to support the National 
11
Institutes of Health in the development of reference 
12
materials and best practices for the assessment and 
13
validation of COVID–19 test results.
