SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds that— 
2
(1) Julius Rosenwald was born in 1862 in 
3
Springfield, Illinois, to Samuel Rosenwald and his 
4
wife, Augusta Hammerslough, a Jewish immigrant 
5
couple from Germany; 
6
(2) in 1868, Samuel Rosenwald purchased the 
7
Lyon House, where Julius grew up and lived with 
8
his family until the 1880s, which— 
9
(A) was diagonally across the street from 
10
the home where Abraham Lincoln lived prior to 
11
becoming president; and 
12
(B)(i) was restored recently before the date 
13
of enactment of this Act; and 
14
(ii) as of that date of enactment, was with-
15
in the boundary of the Lincoln Home National 
16
Historic Site, a unit of the National Park Sys-
17
tem; 
18
(3) Julius Rosenwald— 
19
(A) learned the clothing trade with rel-
20
atives in New York City; and 
21
(B) used that knowledge on moving to Chi-
22
cago, where he became part-owner and presi-
23
dent of Sears, Roebuck & Company, which— 
24
(i) he transformed into a retailing 
25
powerhouse in the early 20th century; and

(ii) could be considered the Amazon of 
1
its day; 
2
(4) the embodiment of the Jewish concept of 
3
‘‘tzedakah’’, righteousness and charity, Rosenwald 
4
used his fortune for numerous philanthropic activi-
5
ties, particularly to enhance the lives of African 
6
Americans, including by— 
7
(A) providing $25,000 for the construction 
8
of Young Men’s Christian Associations (com-
9
monly known as ‘‘YMCAs’’) for African Ameri-
10
cans during the Jim Crow era in cities that 
11
raised $75,000; and 
12
(B) eventually, supporting the construction 
13
of YMCAs in 24 cities across the United States; 
14
(5)(A) after his introduction to Booker T. 
15
Washington in 1911, Julius Rosenwald— 
16
(i) joined the Board of Trustees of the 
17
Tuskegee Institute; and 
18
(ii) financially contributed to a pilot pro-
19
gram to build 6 schools in rural Alabama for 
20
African-American children who were receiving 
21
little to no education; and 
22
(B) the donations by Rosenwald described in 
23
subparagraph (A) were matched by the local Afri-

can-American communities that were committed to 
1
providing education for their children; 
2
(6)(A) the success of the pilot program referred 
3
to in paragraph (5)(A)(ii) led to the construction of 
4
more than 5,300 Rosenwald Schools and related 
5
buildings over a 20-year period in 15 southern 
6
States under the direction of the Julius Rosenwald 
7
Fund; 
8
(B) the schools described in subparagraph 
9
(A)— 
10
(i) were the result of a 3-way partnership 
11
among the Julius Rosenwald Fund, local com-
12
munities that, although generally poor, contrib-
13
uted land, labor, materials, and money to build 
14
and maintain the schools, and local govern-
15
ments that were required by law to provide pub-
16
lic schools for all children but divided funds un-
17
equally between Black and White systems; and 
18
(ii) often became the focus of great pride 
19
and affection among the applicable commu-
20
nities; 
21
(C) during the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s, 1⁄3 of 
22
all African-American children in the South were edu-
23
cated in Rosenwald Schools;

(D) a 2011 study by 2 Federal Reserve econo-
1
mists concluded that the schools played a significant

role in narrowing the gap between the educational 
3
levels of Black and White students in the South; and 
4
(E) Members of Congress and poet Maya 
5
Angelou are among prominent graduates of Rosen-

wald Schools;

(7) the Julius Rosenwald Fund— 
8
(A) supported early National Association

for the Advancement of Colored People cases 
10
that eventually led to the Supreme Court deci-
11
sion in Brown v. Board of Education of To-
12
peka, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), which outlawed 
13
segregation in public education; and 
14
(B) provided fellowships to talented Afri-
15
can Americans in the arts and sciences— 
16
(i) including the acclaimed historian 
17
John Hope Franklin, noted writer and civil 
18
rights activist W.E.B. Du Bois, artist 
19
Jacob Lawrence, singer Marian Anderson, 
20
diplomat Ralph Bunche, and many others;

and

(ii) some of whom worked under 
23
Thurgood Marshall on the Supreme Court

case referred to in subparagraph (A);

(A) provided support for a number of His-
2
torically Black Colleges and Universities, in-
3
cluding Fisk, Dillard, and Howard Universities;

and

(B) used his wealth for other worthy 
6
causes, including the creation of the Jewish 
7
United Fund of Metropolitan Chicago and the

Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago;

and 
10
(9) the contributions of Julius Rosenwald to 
11
improving the lives of African Americans, as well as 
12
the lives of those who reside in Chicago and

throughout the United States, are worthy of recogni-
14
tion and further examination.
