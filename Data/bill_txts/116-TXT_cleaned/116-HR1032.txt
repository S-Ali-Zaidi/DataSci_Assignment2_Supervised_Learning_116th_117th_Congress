RESOLUTION 
Instructing the Committee on the Judiciary to further its 
inquiry into the misconduct of William P. Barr, Attorney 
General of the United States. 
Whereas William P. Barr, Attorney General of the United 
States, has taken deliberate actions that violate the 
rights of the American people, assault the principle of im-
partial administration of justice, and undermine the con-
stitutional structure of separation of powers across three 
co-equal branches of Government;

•HRES 1032 IH 
Whereas Attorney General Barr abused the power of his of-
fice to initiate pretextual antitrust investigations into 
‘‘unpopular’’ American corporations in the cannabis, 
automobile, and technology industries; 
Whereas such investigations misused the resources Congress 
appropriated for the Department of Justice to harass and 
intimidate companies based on President Donald J. 
Trump’s whims and without a proper legal predicate for 
such investigations; 
Whereas Attorney General Barr impaired the proper function 
of the Congress of the United States, a coequal branch 
of Government, by— 
(1) withholding subpoenaed information, including 
Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s full report, and refusing 
to appear before the House of Representatives Committee 
on the Judiciary on March 2, 2019; 
(2) failing to comply with a subpoena issued by the 
House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and 
Reform on April 2, 2019, to produce documents; 
(3) ordering a Department of Justice employee, 
John Gore, not to comply with a Committee on Oversight 
and Reform subpoena requiring him to appear for deposi-
tion testimony before the Committee on April 11, 2019; 
and 
(4) prohibiting the referral of the Intelligence Com-
munity whistleblower complaint to the House Permanent 
Select Committee on Intelligence as directed by law; 
Whereas Attorney General Barr eroded confidence in the ju-
dicial system by questioning the legitimacy of Depart-
ment of Justice investigations and discrediting the De-
partment’s finding, by—

•HRES 1032 IH 
(1) casting aspersions on the lawful inquiry into for-
eign interference in the 2016 Presidential elections call-
ing it a ‘‘travesty’’ and repeatedly asserting the United 
States ‘‘spied’’ on then candidate Donald Trump’s cam-
paign; 
(2) misleading the Congress and the public by offer-
ing a ‘‘summary letter’’ of the Special Counsel Robert 
Mueller’s report that, according to Mueller, did ‘‘not fully 
capture the context, nature, and substance of this Of-
fice’s work and conclusion’’ and created ‘‘Public confu-
sion about critical aspects of the results of our investiga-
tion. This threatens to undermine a central purpose for 
which the Department appointed the Special Counsel: to 
assure full public confidence in the outcome of the inves-
tigation,’’; and 
(3) soliciting foreign assistance for information that 
would raise doubts about the origins and integrity of the 
investigation into the foreign inference in the 2016 elec-
tion; 
Whereas Attorney General Barr has abused his office to fur-
ther the personal political goals of President Trump and 
target former Vice President Joe Biden, a candidate for 
President in 2020, by announcing that the Department 
of Justice is accepting and reviewing information from 
the President’s personal attorney, Rudolph Giuliani, who 
has peddled disproven conspiracy theories about Vice 
President Joe Biden’s and his son, Hunter Biden’s, en-
gagement in Ukraine; 
Whereas President Trump withheld congressionally approved 
military assistance to Ukraine to pressure that nation to 
announce an investigation into the same conspiracy theo-
ries promoted by Rudolph Giuliani in an effort to smear

•HRES 1032 IH 
Vice President Joe Biden and further President Trump’s 
election prospects, an offense that ultimately led to the 
President Trump’s impeachment; 
Whereas Attorney General Barr has obstructed justice, un-
dermined the American people’s confidence in the crimi-
nal justice system, abused the authority of his office, and 
violated the principle of equal justice under law, by re-
peatedly providing favor to the friends and political allies 
of President Trump, including— 
(1) interfering with the prosecution of President 
Trump’s former attorney, Michael Cohen, who pleaded 
guilty to campaign finance violations in connection with 
Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign for President; 
(2) endeavoring to shield President Trump from 
criminal charges for campaign finance violations by hav-
ing the Department of Justice write a memorandum de-
signed to undercut the legal rationale for Michael 
Cohen’s prosecution and subsequent prosecutions in the 
case, knowing President Trump, identified as ‘‘Individual 
1’’ in the Government’s complaint, directed Cohen’s ac-
tions and therefore may also be criminally liable; 
(3) corruptly pressuring acting United States Attor-
ney Timothy Shea, and in so doing career prosecutors in 
the United States Attorney’s Office, to reduce the rec-
ommended sentence for President Trump’s friend and 
campaign advisor Roger Stone and ‘‘cut Stone a break’’ 
because of ‘‘political concerns’’; 
(4) creating a culture of intimidation within the De-
partment of Justice designed to provide preferential 
treatment to the friends and associates of President 
Trump such that a career prosecutor testified to the 
House of Representatives that if Roger Stone was not

•HRES 1032 IH 
provided special treatment, the prosecutor would ‘‘loose 
[his] job’’; 
(5) overruling the career prosecutors in the Depart-
ment of Justice and instructing United States Attorney 
Timothy Shea to move to dismiss the false-statements 
charges against Michael Flynn, former Donald Trump 
campaign advisor and White House National Security 
Advisor, even after Flynn had pleaded guilty, based on a 
distortion of the record; 
(6) decontextualizing the words of acting Assistant 
Attorney General for National Security, Mary B. 
McCord, in an effort to mislead the Court and the Amer-
ican public about the legality and process of the inves-
tigation into Flynn’s contacts with Russian Ambassador 
Sergey Kislyak; and 
(7) removing without cause acting United States At-
torney for the Southern District of New York, Geoffrey 
Berman, who was overseeing several investigations into 
the friends and associates of President Trump, includ-
ing— 
(A) the President’s 2016 inaugural committee; 
(B) President Trump’s former attorney Michael 
Cohen; 
(C) 
President 
Trump’s 
attorney 
Rudolph 
Giuliani; 
(D) Giuliani’s associates Lev Parnas and Igor 
Fruman; and 
(E) Deutsche Bank, a financial institution with 
an extensive business relationship with President 
Trump, the Trump Organization, and entities con-
trolled by the family of his son-in-law, Jared 
Kushner;

•HRES 1032 IH 
Whereas such a pattern interference in the specific cases that 
may affect the President or his family, friends, or inter-
ests, raises a logical inference that Attorney General 
Barr is acting corruptly to protect President Trump from 
any criminal culpability and effectively placing the Presi-
dent beyond the reach of the law; 
Whereas the New York City Bar, raised ‘‘enormous con-
cerns’’ about United States Attorney Geoff Berman’s fir-
ing, stating that Attorney General Barr’s actions to 
‘‘summarily remove a U.S. Attorney in a context in which 
associates of the President (and possibly the President 
himself) are reported to be under active investigation by 
that office suggests political interference and undermines 
confidence in the integrity of our justice system’’; 
Whereas the New York City Bar Association called on Con-
gress to ‘‘examine closely Mr. Barr’s motives for taking 
this precipitous action and whether or not he commu-
nicated with the president before, during or after doing 
so’’; 
Whereas Attorney General Barr violated rights of American 
People enshrined in the First Amendment of the United 
States Constitution by— 
(1) ordering the dispersal of a peaceful racial justice 
protest on Lafayette Square and H Street, Northwest in 
Washington, District of Columbia, with chemical agents, 
flash bangs, and batons so that President Trump could 
walk across Lafayette Square to the site of the recently 
cleared protest for a photo opportunity; and 
(2) deploying law enforcement officers across the 
country and in particular, the unidentified officers in 
Washington, DC, to control activity protected by the 
First Amendment;

•HRES 1032 IH 
Whereas Attorney General Barr, echoing a common assertion 
by President Trump that elections in the United States 
are ‘‘rigged’’, is further undermining the people’s con-
fidence in the democratic system by making unsubstan-
tiated claims that elections conducted by mail, which will 
be necessary in November 2020 because of the inter-
national coronavirus pandemic, are insecure and rife with 
fraud, and insinuating the results may not be legitimate; 
and 
Whereas, if the actions and events described in this resolution 
are accurate, Attorney General Barr would have repeat-
edly engaged in misconduct that would constitute a gross 
violation of his oath of office and betrayal of trust of the 
American people: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That— 
1
(1) the Committee on the Judiciary shall in-
2
quire into the foregoing instances to determine
