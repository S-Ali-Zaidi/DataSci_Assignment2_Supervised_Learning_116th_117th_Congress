RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the goals of November National Lung 
Cancer Awareness Month and for the early detection 
of lung cancer. 
Whereas lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related 
death among men and women in the United States, ac-
counting for more deaths than colon cancer, breast can-
cer, and prostate cancer combined; 
Whereas lung cancer is the second most common cancer in 
the United States; 
Whereas 1 in 15 men and 1 in 17 women in the United 
States will develop lung cancer during their lifetime; 
Whereas it is estimated that in 2020, 228,820 individuals in 
the United States will be diagnosed with lung cancer, and 
135,720 individuals will die from the disease;

Whereas the 5-year survival rate for localized lung cancer is 
around 59 percent, yet only about 17 percent of lung 
cancers are diagnosed at this stage; 
Whereas screening for lung cancer for high-risk individuals 
using low-dose computed tomography can lead to the ear-
lier detection of lung cancer and save lives, reducing the 
mortality by 20 percent when compared to screening by 
chest x-ray in the National Lung Screening Trial and re-
ducing the risk of death at 10 years by 24 percent in 
men and 33 percent in women when compared to no 
screening as demonstrated by another large randomized 
trial; 
Whereas lung cancer screening can effectively reduce lung 
cancer mortality, yet only a small percentage of individ-
uals (3.9 to 8.6 percent) considered to be at high risk for 
developing lung cancer actually undergo lung cancer 
screening with low-dose computed tomography; and 
Whereas educational efforts can increase awareness for lung 
cancer and lung cancer screening among the general pub-
lic, patients, and health care workers, thereby increasing 
the early detection of lung cancer: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the goals and ideals of November

National Lung Cancer Awareness Month;

(2) supports efforts to increase awareness of,

and education about, lung cancer and lung cancer
