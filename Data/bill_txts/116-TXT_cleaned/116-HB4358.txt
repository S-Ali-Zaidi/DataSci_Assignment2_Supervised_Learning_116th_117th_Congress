•HR 4358 IH
(1) Preliminary damage assessments play a 
1
critical role in assessing and validating the impact 
2
and magnitude of a disaster. 
3
(2) Through the preliminary damage assess-
4
ment process, representatives from the Federal 
5
Emergency Management Agency work with State 
6
and local officials to gather information that serves 
7
as the basis for disaster assistance requests. 
8
(3) Various factors can impact the duration of 
9
a preliminary damage assessment and the cor-
10
responding submission of a major disaster request, 
11
however, the average time between when a disaster 
12
occurs, and the submission of a corresponding dis-
13
aster request has been found to be approximately 
14
twenty days longer for flooding disasters. 
15
(4) With communities across the country facing 
16
increased instances of catastrophic flooding and 
17
other extreme weather events, accurate and efficient 
18
preliminary damage assessments have become criti-
19
cally important to the relief process for impacted 
20
states and municipalities.
