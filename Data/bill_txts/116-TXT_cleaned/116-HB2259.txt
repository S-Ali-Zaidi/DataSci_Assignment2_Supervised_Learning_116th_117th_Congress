SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

(2) The tactic of using professional union orga-
1
nizers and agents to infiltrate a targeted employer’s 
2
workplace, a practice commonly referred to as ‘‘salt-
3
ing’’ has evolved into an aggressive form of harass-
4
ment not contemplated when the National Labor Re-
5
lations Act was enacted and threatens the balance of 
6
rights which is fundamental to collective bargaining. 
7
(3) Increasingly, union organizers are seeking 
8
employment with nonunion employers not because of 
9
a desire to work for such employers but primarily to 
10
organize the employees of such employers or to in-
11
flict economic harm specifically designed to put non-
12
union competitors out of business, or to do both. 
13
(4) While no employer may discriminate against 
14
employees based upon the views of employees con-
15
cerning collective bargaining, an employer should 
16
have the right to expect job applicants to be pri-
17
marily interested in utilizing the skills of the appli-
18
cants to further the goals of the business of the em-
19
ployer. 
20
(b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this Act are— 
21
(1) to preserve the balance of rights between 
22
employers, employees, and labor organizations which 
23
is fundamental to collective bargaining;

(2) to preserve the rights of workers to orga-
1
nize, or otherwise engage in concerted activities pro-
2

4
individuals who seek or gain employment in order to 
5
disrupt the workplace of the employer or otherwise 
6
inflict economic harm designed to put the employer

out of business.
