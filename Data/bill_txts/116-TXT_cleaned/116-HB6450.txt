SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) During a national emergency, state of emer-
8
gency, or public health emergency, some merchants 
9
have taken unfair advantage of consumers by greatly 
10
increasing prices for essential consumer goods.

•HR 6450 IH
(2) While the pricing of consumer goods and 
1
other supplies is generally best left to the market-
2
place under ordinary conditions, when a declared na-
3
tional emergency or state of emergency results in ab-
4
normal disruptions of the market, the public interest 
5
requires that excessive and unjustified increases in 
6
the prices of essential consumer goods be prohibited. 
7
(3) To protect citizens from excessive and un-
8
justified increases in the prices charged during or 
9
shortly after a declared national emergency or state 
10
of emergency for consumer goods and supplies that 
11
are vital and necessary for the health, safety, and 
12
welfare of consumers is of utmost concern and im-
13
portance.

15
GENCIES. 
16
(a) IN GENERAL.—During an emergency declaration, 
17
including a renewal thereof, and for a period of 30 days 
18
after such emergency period ends, it shall be unlawful, in 
19
the region or State affected by the emergency declaration, 
20
for any seller to sell or offer to sell any consumer good 
21
for a price that is more than 10 percent greater than the

23
sumer goods during the 120-day period before the date 
24
of the declaration of the emergency.

(b) FACTORS FOR CONSIDERATION.—In determining 
1
whether a seller has violated subsection (a), there shall 
2
be taken into account, with respect to the price at which 
3
such seller sold or offered for sale the consumer good, fac-
4
tors that include— 
5
(1) whether such increase in price was directly 
6
attributable to additional costs of the consumer 
7
goods, or directly attributable to additional costs for 
8
labor or materials used to provide the consumer 
9
goods during the emergency declaration; and 
10
(2) whether such price is not more than 10 per-
11
cent greater than the total of the cost to the seller 
12
plus the markup customarily applied by the seller for 
13
that consumer good in the usual course of business 
14
before the onset of the public health emergency.
