SEC. 2. REPORT ON EFFORTS BY DEPARTMENT OF VET-
1
ERANS 
AFFAIRS 
TO 
IMPLEMENT 
SAFETY 
2
PLANNING IN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS. 
3
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following find-
4
ings: 
5
(1) The Department of Veterans Affairs must 
6
be more effective in its approach to reducing the 
7
burden of veteran suicide connected to mental health 
8
diagnoses, to include expansion of treatment deliv-
9
ered via telehealth methods and in rural areas. 
10
(2) An innovative project, known as Suicide As-
11
sessment and Follow-up Engagement: Veteran 
12
Emergency Treatment (in this subsection referred to 
13
as ‘‘SAFE VET’’), was designed to help suicidal vet-
14
erans seen at emergency departments within the 
15
Veterans Health Administration and was success-
16
fully implemented in five intervention sites beginning 
17
in 2010. 
18
(3) A 2018 study found that safety planning 
19
intervention under SAFE VET was associated with 
20
45 percent fewer suicidal behaviors in the six-month 
21
period following emergency department care and 
22
more than double the odds of a veteran engaging in 
23
outpatient behavioral health care. 
24
(4) SAFE VET is a promising alternative and 
25
acceptable delivery of care system that augments the 
26

3 
•HR 8107 IH
treatment of suicidal veterans in emergency depart-
1
ments of the Veterans Health Administration and 
2
helps ensure that those veterans have appropriate 
3
follow-up care. 
4
(5) Beginning in September 2018, the Veterans 
5
Health Administration implemented a suicide pre-
6
vention program based on the findings of SAFE 
7
VET, known as the SPED program, for veterans 
8
presenting to the emergency department who are as-
9
sessed to be at risk for suicide and are safe to be 
10
discharged home. 
11
(6) The SPED program includes issuance and 
12
update of a safety plan and post-discharge follow-up 
13
outreach for veterans to facilitate engagement in 
14
outpatient mental health care. 
15
(b) REPORT.— 
16
(1) IN
GENERAL.—Not later than 180 days 
17
after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Sec-

20
forts of the Secretary to implement a suicide preven-
21
tion program for veterans presenting to an emer-
22

23
erans Health Administration who are assessed to be 
24
at risk for suicide and are safe to be discharged
