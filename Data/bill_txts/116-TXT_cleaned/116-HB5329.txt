•HR 5329 IH
(1) Private sector business concerns, which are 
1
free to respond to the private or public demands of 
2
the marketplace, constitute the strength of the 
3
United States economic system. 
4
(2) Competitive private enterprises are the most 
5
productive, efficient, and effective sources of goods 
6
and services. 
7
(3) Unfair Government competition with the 
8
private sector of the economy is detrimental to the 
9
United States economic system. 
10
(4) Unfair Government competition with the 
11
private sector of the economy is at an unacceptably 
12
high level, both in scope and in dollar volume. 
13
(5) Current law and policy have failed to ad-
14
dress adequately the problem of unfair Government 
15
competition with the private sector of the economy. 
16
(6) It is in the public interest that the Federal 
17
Government establish a consistent policy to rely on 
18
the private sector of the economy to provide goods 
19
and services necessary for or beneficial to the oper-
20
ation and management of Federal agencies and to 
21
avoid unfair Government competition with the pri-
22
vate sector of the economy.

SEC. 4. PROCUREMENT FROM PRIVATE SOURCES. 
7
(a) POLICY.—In the process of governing, the Fed-
8
eral Government should not compete with its citizens. The 
9
competitive enterprise system, characterized by individual 
10
freedom and initiative, is the primary source of national 
11
economic strength. In recognition of this principle, it has 
12
been and continues to be the general policy of the Federal 
13
Government— 
14
(1) to rely on commercial sources to supply the 
15
products and services the Government needs; 
16
(2) to refrain from providing a product or serv-
17
ice if the product or service can be procured more 
18
economically from a commercial source; and 
19
(3) to utilize Federal employees to perform in-
20
herently governmental functions (as that term is de-
21
fined in section 5 of the Federal Activities Inventory 
22
Reform Act of 1998 (Public Law 105–270; 112 
23
Stat. 2384)).

10
(2) the head of the agency determines and cer-
11
tifies to Congress in accordance with regulations 
12
promulgated by the Director of the Office of Man-
13
agement and Budget that— 
14
(A) Federal Government production, man-
15
ufacture, or provision of a good or service is 
16
necessary for the national defense or homeland 
17
security; 
18
(B) a good or service is so critical to the 
19
mission of the agency or so inherently govern-
20
mental in nature that it is in the public interest 
21
to require production or performance, respec-
22
tively, by Government employees; or 
23
(C) there is no private source capable of 
24
providing the good or service.
