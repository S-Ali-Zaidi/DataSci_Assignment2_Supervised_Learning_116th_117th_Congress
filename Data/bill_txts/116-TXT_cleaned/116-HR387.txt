RESOLUTION 
Condemning continued violence against civilians by armed 
groups in the Central African Republic and supporting 
efforts to achieve a lasting political solution to the con-
flict. 
Whereas the overthrow of the Government of the Central Af-
rican Republic in March 2013 and subsequent violence 
has led to the proliferation of multiple armed groups, 
which have been responsible for widespread atrocities 
based on perceived or actual religious or ethnic identities; 
Whereas the United Nations (UN) concluded in 2014 that 
the Central African Republic’s minority Muslim commu-
nity had been the target of ethnic cleansing, and multiple 
UN officials have warned of a risk of genocide;

Whereas, according to the United Nations, an estimated 
2,900,000 people are in need of humanitarian assistance, 
over 590,000 Central Africans are refugees in neigh-
boring countries, and over 640,000 people are displaced, 
most of whom are women and children; 
Whereas armed groups continue to engage in gross human 
rights abuses, violence, pillaging, and the illicit traf-
ficking of natural resources such as ivory, gold, cattle, 
and diamonds; 
Whereas armed groups have intentionally targeted personnel 
from the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated 
Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic 
(MINUSCA), aid workers, and journalists, making the 
Central African Republic one of the world’s most dan-
gerous operating environments for humanitarian actors; 
Whereas the Central African Republic has made significant 
progress toward democracy by conducting democratic 
elections despite the lack of security around electoral poll-
ing stations and some irregularities, and inaugurated 
President Faustin-Archange Touade´ra in March 2016; 
Whereas the establishment of the Special Criminal Court in 
June 2017 and the creation of more than 1,000 peace 
committees across the country demonstrate a genuine 
commitment to justice and accountability on the part of 
the people of the Central African Republic; and 
Whereas, since 2013, the United States has been the largest 
single donor to the humanitarian response in the Central 
African Republic, promoted peace and social cohesion, 
supported the deployment of MINUSCA, enacted sanc-
tions against senior leaders of armed groups, and pro-
vided life-saving assistance to communities in the Central
