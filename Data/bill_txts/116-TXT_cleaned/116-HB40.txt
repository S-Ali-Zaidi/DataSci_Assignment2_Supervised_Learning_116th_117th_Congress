SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. 
7
(a) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds that— 
8
(1) approximately 4,000,000 Africans and their 
9
descendants were enslaved in the United States and 
10
colonies that became the United States from 1619 to 
11
1865; 
12
(2) the institution of slavery was constitu-
13
tionally and statutorily sanctioned by the Govern-
14
ment of the United States from 1789 through 1865; 
15
(3) the slavery that flourished in the United 
16
States constituted an immoral and inhumane depri-
17
vation of Africans’ life, liberty, African citizenship 
18
rights, and cultural heritage, and denied them the 
19
fruits of their own labor; 
20
(4) a preponderance of scholarly, legal, commu-
21
nity evidentiary documentation and popular culture 
22
markers constitute the basis for inquiry into the on- 
23
going effects of the institution of slavery and its leg-

acy of persistent systemic structures of discrimina-
1
tion on living African-Americans and society in the 
2
United States; and 
3
(5) following the abolition of slavery the United 
4
States Government, at the Federal, State, and local 
5
level, continued to perpetuate, condone and often 
6
profit from practices that continued to brutalize and 
7
disadvantage African-Americans, including share 
8
cropping, convict leasing, Jim Crow, redlining, un-
9
equal education, and disproportionate treatment at 
10
the hands of the criminal justice system; and 
11
(6) as a result of the historic and continued dis-
12
crimination, African-Americans continue to suffer 
13
debilitating economic, educational, and health hard-
14
ships including but not limited to having nearly 
15
1,000,000 black people incarcerated; an unemploy-
16
ment rate more than twice the current white unem-
17
ployment rate; and an average of less than 1⁄16 of 
18
the wealth of white families, a disparity which has 
19
worsened, not improved over time. 
20
(b) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act is to estab-
21
lish a commission to study and develop Reparation pro-
22
posals for African-Americans as a result of— 
23
(1) the institution of slavery, including both the 
24
Trans-Atlantic and the domestic ‘‘trade’’ which ex-

1
through 1865 within the other colonies that became 
2
the United States, and which included the Federal 
3
and State governments which constitutionally and 
4
statutorily supported the institution of slavery; 
5
(2) the de jure and de facto discrimination 
6
against freed slaves and their descendants from the 
7
end of the Civil War to the present, including eco-
8
nomic, political, educational, and social discrimina-

tion; 
10
(3) the lingering negative effects of the institu-
11
tion of slavery and the discrimination described in 
12
paragraphs (1) and (2) on living African-Americans 
13
and on society in the United States; 
14
(4) the manner in which textual and digital in-
15
structional resources and technologies are being used 
16
to deny the inhumanity of slavery and the crime 
17
against humanity of people of African descent in the 
18
United States; 
19
(5) the role of Northern complicity in the 
20
Southern based institution of slavery; 
21
(6) the direct benefits to societal institutions, 
22
public and private, including higher education, cor-
23
porations, religious and associational;
