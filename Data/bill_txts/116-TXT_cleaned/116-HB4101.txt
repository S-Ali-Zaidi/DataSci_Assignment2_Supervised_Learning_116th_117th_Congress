SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds that— 
2
(1) infrastructure plays a vital role in the lives 
3
of all people in the United States; 
4
(2) the aging infrastructure of the United 
5
States is in need of a significant investment to re-
6
pair, rebuild, and modernize, and in the process, the 
7
Federal Government can take necessary steps to ad-
8
dress economic and racial injustices that have lim-
9
ited opportunities for far too many people of the 
10
United States; 
11
(3) decades of disinvestment and exclusionary 
12
policies have isolated many people of color, low-in-
13
come people, and disabled individuals in the United 
14
States from opportunity across the urban centers, 
15
deindustrialized cities, rural regions, and Tribal 
16
areas of the United States, including horribly inad-
17
equate investment to ensure universal access to 
18
clean air and water, safe and reliable transportation, 
19
affordable housing, quality living wage jobs, high- 
20
speed internet, modernized schools, and parks and 
21
community facilities; 
22
(4) while the construction of the National High-
23
way System remains one of the most transformative

achievements in the history of the United States, it 
1
came at the expense of many low-income commu-
2
nities as well as minority neighborhoods of all in-
3
come levels that were destroyed by the construction 
4
and isolated from the broader community and from 
5
economic opportunity; 
6
(5) investing in repairing, rebuilding, and mod-
7
ernizing the infrastructure of the United States pre-
8
sents an opportunity to learn from the mistakes of 
9
the past and reimagine how communities can design 
10
and build infrastructure to be more equitable, help-
11
ing to address structural inequities faced by 
12
marginalized communities nationwide, including a 
13
lack of good paying jobs, affordable, accessible, and 
14
inclusive housing, decaying roads, bridges, and 
15
schools, inadequate access to technology, and expo-
16
sure to toxic emissions and poisoned water; 
17
(6) accessibility to quality infrastructure, train-
18
ing, and jobs is an issue across the United States, 
19
spanning from rural and Tribal areas to urban and 
20
suburban areas; 
21
(7) transportation infrastructure has a signifi-
22
cant impact on access to jobs, education, healthcare, 
23
healthy foods, and other essential services;

(8) accessibility to essential services is defined 
1
not only by speed, but also by ease of access, which 
2
includes the ability to safely and conveniently access 
3
services by all modes of travel; 
4
(9) with a shortage of construction firms that 
5
are ready and able to take on the large-scale infra-
6
structure projects the United States demands, the 
7
close to 478,000 specialty trade contractors in small-
8
er minority, women, and disadvantaged businesses 
9
could be supported to meet this demand; 
10
(10) small businesses and under-represented 
11
contractors, including minority-, women-, veteran- 
12
owned businesses, and businesses owned by disabled 
13
individuals should have the opportunity to rebuild 
14
their communities and employ hardworking people of 
15
the United States along the way; 
16
(11) as of 2018, about 1⁄4 of the infrastructure 
17
workforce is projected to retire or permanently leave 
18
their jobs over the next decade, compounding the in-
19
frastructure crisis in the United States; 
20
(12) as of 2019, the Board of Governors of the 
21
Federal Reserve System finds that skilled trades and 
22
many occupations that do not require a 4-year de-
23
gree are not considered to be at significant risk of 
24
automation;

1
employment opportunities in both the public and pri-
2
vate sectors, including design, manufacturing, con-
3
struction, operation, governance, and maintenance of 
4
infrastructure assets in the United States; 
5
(14) more than 1 in 10 jobs in the United 
6
States is a transportation- or infrastructure-related 
7

8
(15) many infrastructure jobs provide competi-
9
tive wages with low barriers to entry, many of which 
10
require on-the-job training in lieu of formal 4-year

12
(16) in spite of rising income inequality, infra-
13
structure jobs paid approximately 30 percent more

to low income individuals than other occupations in

(17) women, people of color, and particularly

women of color are underrepresented in construction

20
rently make up about 50 percent of the workforce,

women in construction and extraction occupations

2
(20) by focusing on improving workforce devel-
3

4
egies, the Federal Government can improve the qual-
5
ity of future projects and better ensure that all com-

(A) protect workers;

have unfairly burdened low-income communities

and communities of color with pollution of geo-
