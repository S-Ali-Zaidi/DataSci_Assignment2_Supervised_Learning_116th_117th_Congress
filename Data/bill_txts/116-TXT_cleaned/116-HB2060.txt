SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Ensuring a Secure Af-
2
ghanistan Act’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) A premature withdrawal of United States 
6
Armed Forces from Afghanistan would result in in-
7
creased instability, violence, and the loss of human 
8
rights established through the presence of the 
9
United States and its allies over the past 17 years. 
10
(2) It is the objective of the United States Gov-
11
ernment to ensure a secure and stable Afghanistan 
12
that has the ability to secure its borders, maintain 
13
its own military forces, and prevent the establish-
14
ment of terrorist safe havens that could be used to 
15
launch attacks against the United States. 
16
(3) A hasty withdrawal without ensuring the 
17
stability of the Government of Afghanistan and its 
18
ability to perform the functions as outlined will im-
19
pact the security of the United States and its allies. 
20
Additionally, a hasty withdrawal will jeopardize the 
21
tremendous gains made in development and human 
22
rights for the citizens of Afghanistan. 
23
(4) The current talks with the Taliban led by 
24
Special Representative Zalmay Khalilzad have ex-
25
cluded the legitimate Afghan government, despite 
26
21:31 Apr 15, 2019
H2060

•HR 2060 IH
the apparent completion of two ‘‘draft’’ agreements 
1
between the United States and the Taliban. Other 
2
vital constituencies have been excluded as well. 
3
(5) The foreign terrorist organization al Qaeda, 
4
responsible for the attacks of September 11, 2001, 
5
continues to operate in Afghanistan. 
6
(6) The Taliban, which contests or controls ap-
7
proximately half of Afghanistan, has a strong and 
8
intricate relationship with al Qaeda, and al Qaeda 
9
still sees Afghanistan as a safe haven for its leader-
10
ship. 
11
(7) The Taliban has not publicly disavowed al 
12
Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, or al Qaeda’s current 
13
leader, Ayman al Zawahiri. The Taliban has also 
14
never apologized for harboring al Qaeda, the 9/11 
15
hijackers, and others responsible for murdering 
16
thousands of American citizens. 
17
(8) The withdrawal of United States Armed 
18
Forces from Afghanistan, a long-standing Taliban 
19
demand, is a key component of the ongoing talks be-
20
tween the United States and the Taliban. 
21
(9) The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, also 
22
known as ISIS, grew rapidly after the United States 
23
withdrawal of forces from Iraq in 2011. Today, ISIS 
24

still controls thousands of militants, including in Af-
1
ghanistan. 
2
(10) According to the administration’s South 
3
Asia strategy, announced by the President in August 
4
2017, ‘‘Conditions on the ground—not arbitrary 
5
timetables—will guide our strategy from now on.’’.
