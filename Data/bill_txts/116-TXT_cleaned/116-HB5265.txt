SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Holocaust Insurance 
4
Accountability Act of 2019’’. 
5
SEC. 2. PURPOSES. 
6
The purposes of this Act are to— 
7
(1) allow for the enforcement of State laws re-
8
quiring the disclosure of information about Holo-

caust-era insurance policies, notwithstanding the 
1
holding of the Supreme Court of the United States 
2
in American Insurance Association v. Garamendi, 
3
539 U.S. 396 (2003) that such laws are preempted 
4
by the foreign policy espoused by the executive 
5
branch of the Federal Government addressed in that 
6
case; 
7
(2) facilitate the disclosure of information about 
8
Holocaust-era insurance policies under applicable 
9
State laws so that citizens of the United States (and 
10
other persons on whose behalf such laws were en-
11
acted) may know whether they hold any rights under 
12
the policies; 
13
(3) create a new Federal private cause of action 
14
and subject matter jurisdiction to allow the bene-
15
ficiaries of Holocaust-era insurance policies, many of 
16
whom are citizens of the United States, to bring 
17
suits in the courts of the United States to recover 
18
any proceeds under the policies to which they may 
19
be entitled, notwithstanding the defense that such 
20
suits are preempted by the executive branch foreign 
21
policy addressed in Garamendi, with the State law of 
22
the forum or Federal common law providing the rule 
23
of decision governing the right of a beneficiary to re-
24
cover under such policies;

•HR 5265 IH
(4) foreclose defenses to claims brought under 
1
section 4 of this Act arising from any prior judg-
2
ments or settlement agreements (including the class 
3
action judgment and settlement agreement (M21– 
4
89, United States District Court for the Southern 
5
District of New York) in In re: Assicurazioni Gen-
6
eral S.p.A. Holocaust Insurance Litigation) that 
7
were entered and approved based on the erroneous 
8
conclusion that State law claims to recover under 
9
Holocaust-era insurance claims are preempted by 
10
the executive branch foreign policy addressed in 
11
Garamendi; 
12
(5) provide for a uniform statute of limitations 
13
of 10 years after the date of enactment of this Act 
14
in any action to recover under Holocaust-era insur-
15
ance policies under this Act or State law; and 
16
(6) in carrying out the purposes described in 
17
paragraphs (1) through (5), preserve the lawmaking 
18
powers of Congress under article I of the Constitu-
19
tion of the United States, with which the judicial de-
20
cisions cited in this section are inconsistent.
