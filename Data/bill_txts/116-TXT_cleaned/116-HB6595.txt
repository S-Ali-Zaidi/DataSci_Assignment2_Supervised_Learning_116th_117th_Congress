to protecting Americans worldwide.

10
triation of United States citizens, as well as repatri-

ation of remains when deaths occur abroad.

cedures, are unable to handle the remote workload 
15
and requirements for social distancing simulta-
16
neously. 
17

20
American Citizen Services and perform other essen-
21
tial diplomatic duties. 
22
(6) Current United States laws and regulations 
23
are not adequate to meet worldwide needs such as
