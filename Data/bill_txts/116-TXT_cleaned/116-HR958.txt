RESOLUTION 
Condemning the practice of politically motivated imprison-
ment and calling for the immediate release of political 
prisoners in the Russian Federation and urging action 
by the United States Government to impose sanctions 
with respect to persons responsible for that form of 
human rights abuse. 
Whereas the right to liberty and security of a person and the 
protection from arbitrary imprisonment are among the 
principal human rights guaranteed by Article 9 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Ar-
ticle 23 of the Concluding Document of the Vienna Meet-
ing of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Eu-
rope, and Article 5 of the European Convention on

Whereas the Russian Federation, as member of the United 
Nations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation 
in Europe (OSCE), and the Council of Europe, is bound 
by international commitments with regard to human 
rights and the rule of law; 
Whereas, on October 3, 2012, the Parliamentary Assembly of 
the Council of Europe adopted Resolution 1900 (2012) 
which defined anyone whose ‘‘detention has been imposed 
in violation of one of the fundamental guarantees set out 
in the European Convention on Human Rights and its 
Protocols’’ and ‘‘is the result of proceedings which were 
clearly unfair and . . . appears to be connected with po-
litical motives of the authorities’’ as a political prisoner; 
Whereas based on the criteria of the Parliamentary Assembly 
of the Council of Europe Resolution 1900 (2012), the 
Memorial Human Rights Center, a Russian nongovern-
mental organization, estimates that there are currently 
more than 300 political prisoners in the Russian Federa-
tion—a six-fold increase since 2015; 
Whereas the Memorial Human Rights Center list of Russian 
political prisoners includes journalists, civil society activ-
ists, human rights advocates, participants of peaceful or-
ganizations, and Ukrainian citizens from illegally annexed 
Crimea; 
Whereas the Russian Federation’s longest-detained political 
prisoner, Alexey Pichugin, has been incarcerated since 
June 19, 2003, in violation of two rulings by the Euro-
pean Court of Human Rights and the opinion by the 
United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention; 
Whereas, investigative journalist and former editor of the 
independent newspaper Noviye Kolyosa, Igor Rudnikov

has been in pretrial detention since November 1, 2017, 
for alleged extortion charges; 
Whereas Igor Rudnikov’s detention and charges were criti-
cized by the OSCE Representative on Freedom of the 
Media and Reporters without Borders, calling them 
‘‘clearly trumped-up’’ and ‘‘an act of political revenge’’, 
respectively; 
Whereas opposition activist Konstantin Kotov was sentenced 
to 1.5 years’ imprisonment on April 20, 2020, for partici-
pating in peaceful demonstrations, in a ruling Amnesty 
International has described as ‘‘a profound injustice’’; 
Whereas Anastasia Shevchenko, an activist in the Open Rus-
sia movement, has been held under house arrest since 
January 23, 2019, on the charge of belonging to an ‘‘un-
desirable’’ organization and has been designated by Am-
nesty International as a prisoner of conscience; 
Whereas Yuri Dmitriev, a leader of Memorial Human Rights 
Center’s branch in the Republic of Karelia region of the 
Russian Federation who has worked to document mass 
burial sites from Stalin-era executions, is being held in 
pretrial detention on charges of child pornography that 
Human Rights Watch has described as ‘‘bogus’’ and part 
of an ongoing ‘‘smear campaign’’; 
Whereas Dennis Christensen, a Jehovah’s Witness and a 
Danish citizen, was sentenced to 6 years’ imprisonment 
on February 6, 2019, in a decision condemned by the 
United States Commission on International Religious 
Freedom as part of the broader pattern of the Russian 
Government ‘‘engaging in or tolerating severe violations 
of religious freedom’’;

Whereas, on February 10, 2020, seven activists from Rus-
sia’s Penza Oblast were sentenced to terms of six to 
eighteen years for alleged membership in a terrorist 
group following a detention marked by torture, ill-treat-
ment to extract confessions, and periods held incommuni-
cado; 
Whereas Human Rights Watch described the case as an ex-
ample of the Russian authorities ‘‘abusing counterter-
rorism laws to silence critics and deny fundamental 
human rights’’; 
Whereas, on June 18, 2019, the Department of State af-
firmed that ‘‘the United States is deeply concerned by 
the growing number of individuals . . . identified by 
credible human rights organizations as political and reli-
gious prisoners held by the Government of the Russian 
Federation’’ and called on the Government of the Rus-
sian Federation ‘‘to release all those identified as political 
or religious prisoners immediately and cease its use of 
the legal system to suppress dissent and peaceful reli-
gious practice’’; and 
Whereas, on January 28, 2020, 43 parliamentarians from 16 
European countries introduced a Resolution in the Par-
liamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe to appoint 
a rapporteur ‘‘to examine the growing crisis with politi-
cally motivated imprisonments in the Russian Federa-
tion’’: Now, therefore, be it
