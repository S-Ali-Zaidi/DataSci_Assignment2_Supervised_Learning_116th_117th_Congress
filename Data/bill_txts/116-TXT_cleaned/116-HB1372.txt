•HR 1372 IH
(1) On September 1, 1975, President Gerald 
1
Ford provided a diplomatic assurance to Israel that 
2
‘‘the U.S. will support the position that an overall 
3
settlement with Syria in the framework of a peace 
4
agreement must assure Israel’s security from attack 
5
from the Golan Heights [and] it will give great 
6
weight to Israel’s position that any peace agreement 
7
with Syria must be predicated on Israel remaining 
8
on the Golan Heights’’. 
9
(2) In October 1991, Secretary of State James 
10
Baker provided a diplomatic assurance to Israel that 
11
‘‘the United States continues to stand behind the as-
12
surance given by President Ford to Prime Minister 
13
Rabin on September 1, 1975’’. 
14
(3) Iran has used the war in Syria to establish 
15
a long-term military presence in the Levant, to at-
16
tack Israel from across the Golan Heights, and to 
17
create territorial corridors that allow it to provide 
18
arms to its troops and terrorist proxies.

SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
20
It is the sense of Congress that— 
21
(1) Israel’s security from attacks from Syria 
22
and Lebanon cannot be assured without Israeli sov-
23
ereignty over the Golan Heights;

•HR 1372 IH
(2) in light of new realities on the ground, in-
1
cluding Iran’s presence in Syria— 
2
(A) it is unrealistic to expect that the out-
3
come of a peace agreement between Israel and 
4
Syria will be an Israeli withdrawal from the 
5
Golan Heights; and 
6
(B) it is realistic to expect that any peace 
7
agreement between Israel and Syria will only be 
8
achieved on the basis of Israel remaining on the 
9
Golan Heights; and 
10
(3) it is in the United States national security 
11
interest to ensure that— 
12
(A) Israel retains control of the Golan 
13
Heights; and 
14
(B) the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad 
15
faces diplomatic and geopolitical consequences 
16
for its killing of civilians, the ethnic cleansing 
17
of Arab Sunnis, and the use of weapons of 
18
mass destruction.
