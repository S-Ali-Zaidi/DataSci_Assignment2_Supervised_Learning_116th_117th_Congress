SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
3
It is the sense of Congress that— 
4
(1) understanding and preparing for the ongo-
5
ing development of artificial intelligence is critical to 
6
the economic prosperity and social stability of the 
7
United States; 
8
(2) as artificial intelligence evolves, it can great-
9
ly benefit society by powering the information econ-
10
omy, fostering better informed decisions and helping 
11
unlock answers to questions that, as of the date of 
12
the enactment of this Act, are unanswerable; 
13
(3) for the reasons set forth in paragraph (2), 
14
it is beneficial to better understand artificial intel-
15
ligence and foster the development of artificial intel-
16
ligence in a manner that maximizes its benefit to so-
17
ciety; and 
18
(4) it is critical that the priorities of the advi-
19
sory committee established under section 3(a)(1) in-
20
clude developing guidance or recommendations— 
21
(A) to promote a climate of investment and 
22
innovation to ensure the global competitiveness 
23
of the United States;

(B) to optimize the development of artifi-
1
cial intelligence to address the potential growth, 
2
restructuring, or other changes in the United 
3
States workforce that result from the develop-
4
ment of artificial intelligence, with particular 
5
attention to traditionally underrepresented pop-
6
ulations that may be uniquely impacted; 
7
(C) to promote and support the unbiased 
8
development and application of artificial intel-

6
ical hardware, or other contexts not yet con-
7
templated. They may solve tasks requiring 
8
human-like perception, cognition, planning, 
9

6
as advanced as a person across the range of cog-
7
nitive, emotional, and social behaviors.
