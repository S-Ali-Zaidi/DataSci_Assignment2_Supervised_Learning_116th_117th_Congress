RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of Congress that the Office of the 
Speaker of the House is vacant. 
Whereas, on December 18, 2019, the House of Representa-
tives passed H. Res. 755, impeaching Donald John 
Trump, President of the United States; 
Whereas, on December 18, 2019, a motion to reconsider H. 
Res. 755 was laid upon the table; 
Whereas laying a motion to reconsider on the table is an act 
that ‘‘extinguish[es] reconsideration’’ of the bill in ques-
tion;

•HRES 788 IH 
Whereas the motion to lay on the table is used in the House 
for a final, adverse disposition of a matter without de-
bate; 
Whereas after a bill is passed, there can be no further alter-
ation of it in any point; 
Whereas, upon adoption of the Articles of Impeachment, 
which do not name managers, the House subsequently 
adopts resolutions electing managers to present the arti-
cles before the Senate, notifying the Senate of the adop-
tion of articles and election of managers, and authorizing 
the managers to prepare for and to conduct the trial in 
the Senate; 
Whereas President Andrew Johnson was impeached by the 
House of Representatives on March 2, 1868, and the Ar-
ticles of Impeachment against him were delivered to the 
Senate on March 4, 1868; 
Whereas President William Jefferson Clinton was impeached 
by the House of Representatives on December 19, 1998, 
and the Articles of Impeachment against him were deliv-
ered to the Senate the same day; 
Whereas President Donald John Trump was impeached by 
the House of Representatives on December 18, 2019, and 
the Articles of Impeachment against him have yet to be 
delivered to the Senate; 
Whereas no further action can be taken by the House of Rep-
resentatives to address H. Res. 755; 
Whereas it is the duty of the Speaker of the House to oversee 
election of managers to carry the Articles in obedience to 
the resolution of the House to the bar of the Senate, the 
House having previously informed the Senate;

•HRES 788 IH 
Whereas H. Res. 755 is the resolution of the House to inform 
the Senate; 
Whereas failure to present H. Res. 755 implies physical in-
ability to discharge the full duties of the Speaker of the 
House of Representatives; and 
Whereas Clause 8(b)(3)(C) of Rule One of the House Rules 
states ‘‘a vacancy in the Office of Speaker may exist by 
reason of the physical inability of the Speaker to dis-
charge the duties of the office’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, 
1
(1) That Speaker of the House Nancy D. Pelosi 
2
is unable to perform an essential part of her admin-
3
istrative duties and is thus incapacitated; and 
4
(2) that incapacity creates a vacancy in the of-
5
fice of the Speaker of the House of Representatives 
6
in accordance with Clause 8(b)(3)(C) of Rule One of 
7
the House Rules.
