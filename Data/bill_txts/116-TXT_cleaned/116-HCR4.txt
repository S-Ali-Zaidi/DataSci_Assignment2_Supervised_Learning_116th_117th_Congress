CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 
Calling for credible, transparent, and peaceful elections in 
Nigeria, and for other purposes. 
Whereas it is in the national interest of the United States to 
maintain a strong bilateral relationship with a politically 
stable, democratic, and economically sound Nigeria that 
can play a leadership role in the region and the continent 
more broadly; 
Whereas Nigeria has Presidential elections scheduled for Feb-
ruary 16, 2019, and gubernatorial and National Assem-
bly elections scheduled for March 2, 2019; 
Whereas credible elections could further consolidate demo-
cratic gains achieved in Nigeria over the last two decades 
since the transition from military to civilian democratic 
rule;

Whereas a 2017 survey conducted by Afrobarometer found 
that 72 percent of Nigerians agreed that democratic elec-
tions are the best means of choosing their country’s lead-
ers, thus indicating that the country’s citizens are deeply 
committed to democracy; 
Whereas collaboration between civil society actors and the 
international community was a key factor that contrib-
uted to successful elections in 2015; 
Whereas successive elections in Nigeria have featured varying 
degrees of violence; 
Whereas there have been deeply concerning instances of in-
citement to violence in Nigeria by members of both the 
ruling coalition and the opposition inciting supporters to 
ethnic violence as a means by which to gain electoral ad-
vantage, intimidate electoral rivals, or suppress voter 
turnout; 
Whereas, during the Ekiti and Osun gubernatorial elections 
in July 2018 and September 2018, respectively, there 
were concerning incidents in which some elements of Ni-
geria’s security agencies displayed partisanship and a 
lack of objectivity, which risks escalating tensions within 
the country; 
Whereas Nigeria’s Independent National Electoral Commis-
sion (INEC) has improved the voting process, notably 
through the introduction of continuous voter registration, 
the adoption of simultaneous accreditation and voting, 
improvements to the secrecy of the ballot, and the ad-
vancement of smart card reader technology; 
Whereas the statement of the September 2018 Joint National 
Democratic Institute/International Republican Institute 
Pre-Election Assessment Mission to Nigeria cited remain-

ing challenges and concerns such as delays in finalizing 
the legal framework for the elections, delayed release of 
funds for the elections, security threats in the Middle 
Belt and North East, instances of vote-buying, and in-
citement to violence and disinformation; and 
Whereas ensuring transparency in electoral preparations and 
building public confidence in the electoral process is vital 
for the success of the upcoming elections in Nigeria: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate
