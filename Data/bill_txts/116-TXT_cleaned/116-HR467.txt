RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the essential contributions of frontline health 
workers to strengthening the United States national se-
curity and economic prosperity, sustaining and expanding 
progress on global health, and saving the lives of millions 
of women, men, and children around the world. 
Whereas the estimated 140,000,000 people in 2017 affected 
by humanitarian crises, including conflicts and natural 
disasters, was 200 percent higher than 10 years prior; 
Whereas frontline health workers are a critical and cost-effec-
tive component to building country resilience and the ca-
pacity to save lives, foster inclusive economic growth, and 
prevent and respond to humanitarian crises and global 
health security threats from infectious diseases, including 
Ebola;

Whereas frontline health workers include a range of occupa-
tions, such as community health workers, midwives, 
nurses, pharmacists, doctors, and surgeons; 
Whereas the World Health Organization reports that the 
world will face a shortfall of 18,000,000 health workers 
by 2030 without immediate and concerted action, par-
ticularly in low- and middle-income countries, many of 
which are in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, and these are 
regions that have the greatest share of the global disease 
burden and the highest number of preventable deaths, 
and from which many emerging and reemerging global 
health threats originate; 
Whereas nations with healthy populations are more likely to 
be productive, prosperous, and peaceful, while countries 
with poorer health are more prone to instability, conflict, 
and extremism; 
Whereas the United Nations Secretary-General’s High-Level 
Commission on Health Employment and Economic 
Growth found that health employment is a force-multi-
plier for inclusive economic growth and that health in-
vestments provide a nine-fold economic return; 
Whereas frontline health workers are particularly crucial dur-
ing natural or complex emergency situations to saving 
lives and aiding communities to recover, rebuild, and be-
come more resilient; 
Whereas health workers provide lifesaving care at great per-
sonal risk in conflict settings; 
Whereas, in 2018, at least 167 health workers were killed 
and 710 injured in attacks, which occurred in at least 23 
countries in conflict and impeded access to essential

health services for millions while exacerbating refugee cri-
ses; 
Whereas United States leadership and investment has led to 
dramatic successes in global health, including the reduc-
tion of child mortality by 58 percent and of maternal 
mortality by 44 percent from 1990 to 2017, the reduc-
tion of new HIV infections by 36 percent from 2000 to 
2017, and the decrease in malaria mortality by 62 per-
cent from 2000 to 2015, and this progress has contrib-
uted to corresponding productivity and economic growth; 
Whereas access to a well-trained, well-equipped, and well-sup-
ported frontline health workforce is critical to the efficacy 
and sustainability of United States global health pro-
grams; 
Whereas frontline health workers are the first, and often 
only, link to health services for millions of people living 
in low- and middle-income countries and provide services 
where they are most needed, especially in remote and 
rural areas; 
Whereas frontline health workers too often work without the 
resources and equipment they need to adequately protect 
themselves and their patients, including personal protec-
tive 
equipment, 
clean 
water, 
decent 
toilets, 
and 
handwashing facilities with soap; 
Whereas partnerships with faith-based organizations, human-
itarian nongovernmental organizations, and the private 
sector in adequately training, equipping, compensating, 
protecting, and supporting frontline health workers help 
countries achieve progress toward global health goals; 
Whereas despite the key role of frontline health workers in 
improving health, advancing peace and security, and

spurring economic growth, the World Bank and the 
World Health Organization estimate that at least half the 
world’s population lacks access to essential health serv-
ices; 
Whereas the Commission on Health Employment and Eco-
nomic Growth found that increased health workforce em-
ployment is critical to saving lives, spurring inclusive eco-
nomic growth, and promoting women’s empowerment, as 
women comprise at least 70 percent of employment in the 
health and social sectors, compared with about 40 per-
cent across all sectors; 
Whereas every day, more than 14,000 children die worldwide, 
mostly from preventable causes, and 830 women die due 
to pregnancy or childbirth-related complications; 
Whereas every year, millions of people succumb to the rav-
ages of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and other treatable 
and often preventable chronic conditions; and 
Whereas successful implementation of the United States glob-
al health contributions and improved health and socio-
economic outcomes for those served by these programs 
requires integrated, flexible, and cross-sectoral program-
ming: Now, therefore, be it
