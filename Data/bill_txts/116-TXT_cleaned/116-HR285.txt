RESOLUTION 
Recognizing over 85 years of successful State-based alcohol 
regulation since the creation of an effective system of 
independent beer, wine, and spirits distribution. 
Whereas Federal and State regulation of the licensed alcohol 
beverage industry has effectively balanced competition 
with control, while maintaining an orderly, transparent, 
and accountable market, and has moderated the respon-
sible sale and consumption of alcohol, while promoting 
consumer choice and variety; 
Whereas regulated commerce of alcohol beverages annually 
contributes $136 billion in Federal and State tax reve-
nues as well as $682 billion to the United States econ-
omy, and further supports the employment of 4.7 million 
people in the United States in more than 25,000 per-

mitted breweries, distilleries, wineries, more than 20,000 
wholesale distributor facilities, more than 640,000 retail 
outlets, and numerous agricultural, construction, manu-
facturing, transportation, and service industry businesses; 
Whereas prior to the passage of the 18th Amendment to the 
Constitution (Prohibition), which prohibited ‘‘the manu-
facture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors’’, 
the lack of sufficient regulation led to widespread abuses 
of alcohol distribution and consumption to the detriment 
of the public health, welfare, and safety; 
Whereas after its passage, a dramatic increase in illegal ac-
tivity occurred, including unsafe black market alcohol 
production, a growth in violent organized crime, and in-
creased noncompliance with alcohol laws; 
Whereas, in 1933, the 72d Congress submitted to the States 
the question of repealing the 18th Amendment and re-
quiring the transportation or importation of alcohol bev-
erages for delivery or use in any State to be carried out 
in compliance with the laws of that State; 
Whereas Congress has consistently recognized and respected 
the primary authority of States to regulate alcohol in 
order to promote orderly, safe, and stable markets, effi-
cient tax collection, and temperance, as evidenced by and 
through passage of the Webb-Kenyon Act, creating an ex-
ception to the Commerce Clause and empowering States 
to regulate the importation and sale of alcohol beverages 
within their own borders (originally enacted in 1913; 27 
U.S.C. 122), the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (27 
U.S.C. 201 et seq.), the 21st Amendment Enforcement 
Act (27 U.S.C. 122a), and the Sober Truth on Pre-
venting Underage Drinking Act (Public Law 109–422; 
120 Stat. 2890);

Whereas, for decades, the legislatures and alcohol beverage 
control agencies of the 50 States have exercised their pri-
mary authority under the 21st Amendment to ensure the 
creation and maintenance of State-based regulatory sys-
tems for alcohol distribution, promote accountability and 
responsibility by licensing local vendors of alcohol, pre-
vent the vertical integration of the alcohol industry, and 
maintain the integrity of a three-tier system made up of 
producers, importers, wholesale distributors, and retail-
ers; 
Whereas unlike other nations, the development of a trans-
parent, efficient, and accountable United States system 
for the distribution and sale of alcohol beverages, temper-
ance in consumption and sales practices, efficient tax col-
lection, and other essential public health and safety poli-
cies have been successfully guided by the collective experi-
ence and cooperation of government agencies and licensed 
industry members throughout the geographically and cul-
turally diverse Nation; 
Whereas the State-based system of alcohol regulation and a 
system of independent distribution have resulted in re-
ducing barriers to market and providing unprecedented 
choice, variety, and selection for consumers; and 
Whereas members of the licensed alcohol beverage industry 
have created, funded, and supported a wide range of na-
tional, State, and community programs to address prob-
lems associated with alcohol abuse, including drunk driv-
ing and underage drinking: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
