SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. 
1
(a) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds that— 
2
(1) the opportunity for full participation in our 
3
free enterprise system by socially and economically 
4
disadvantaged individuals is essential if we are to 
5
obtain social and economic equality for such individ-
6
uals and improve the functioning of our national 
7
economy; 
8
(2) many such individuals are socially disadvan-
9
taged because of their identification as members of 
10
certain groups that have suffered the effects of dis-
11
criminatory practices or similar invidious cir-
12
cumstances over which they have no control; 
13
(3) such groups include, but are not limited to, 
14
African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native 
15
Americans, Asian Pacific Americans, Asian Indian 
16
Americans, and other minorities; 
17
(4) it is in the national interest to expeditiously 
18
ameliorate the conditions of socially and economi-
19
cally disadvantaged groups; 
20
(5) such conditions can be improved by pro-
21
viding the maximum practicable opportunity for the 
22
development of business concerns owned by members 
23
of socially and economically disadvantaged groups; 
24
(6) such opportunity cannot be fully realized 
25
unless the Federal Government secures the partici-
26

3 
•HR 1432 IH
pation and cooperation of the private sector in a 
1
joint effort to promote the development of business 
2
owned by disadvantaged individuals; 
3
(7) such effort will result in a more equitable 
4
share of productive resources being devoted to busi-
5
ness owned by the disadvantaged and will promote 
6
a balanced economy and increased competition; 
7
(8) while other Federal agencies focus on 
8
broader demographic and emerging businesses, 
9
MBDA focuses exclusively on the unique needs of 
10
minority-owned businesses and enhancing the capac-
11
ity and reach of medium and large scale minority- 
12
owned firms; and 
13
(9) MBDA’s national network of business cen-
14
ters is critical to assisting minority-owned businesses 
15
gain access to capital, contracts, and new markets 
16
through public-private engagement. Therefore, Con-
17
gress must continue to invest in the MBDA business 
18
centers, as they provide direct services to minority- 
19
owned businesses. 
20
(b) PURPOSE.—It is, therefore, the purpose of this 
21
Act to— 
22
(1) establish an Administration within the De-
23
partment of Commerce which will promote and ad-
24
minister programs in the private and public sectors 
25

•HR 1432 IH
to assist the development of business owned by the 
1
disadvantaged; and 
2
(2) achieve such development through the con-
3
duct of programs which will result in increased ac-
4
cess to skilled labor, capital, management, and tech-
5
nology by such business.
