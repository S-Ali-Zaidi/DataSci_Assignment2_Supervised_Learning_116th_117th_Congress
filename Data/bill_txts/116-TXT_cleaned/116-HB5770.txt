A BILL 
To establish a national network of electric vehicle charging 
stations, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Electric Vehicle Free-
4
dom Act’’ or the ‘‘EV Freedom Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:

•HR 5770 IH
(1) Electric vehicles will play an important role 
1
in transitioning to a cleaner transportation system 
2
that protects Americans’ health and our planet. Ac-
3
cording to the United States Department of Energy, 
4
electric vehicles ‘‘produce fewer emissions that con-
5
tribute to climate change and smog than conven-
6
tional vehicles.’’ 
7
(2) Electric vehicles are becoming more popular 
8
among American consumers. United States sales of 
9
electric vehicles increased 27 percent between 2016 
10
and 2017, and 81 percent between 2017 and 2018. 
11
(3) Access to electric vehicle charging stations 
12
is currently insufficient to meet consumer demand. 
13
According to the National Renewable Energy Lab-
14
oratory, ‘‘two key areas of needed improvement in 
15
actual vehicle charging are speed (reducing battery 
16
charging times) and coverage (having adequate and 
17
accessible charging stations)’’. 
18
(4) Demand for publicly accessible electric vehi-
19
cle chargers is projected to grow. At the end of 
20
2017, there were an estimated 17,000 electric vehi-
21
cle direct current fast charging stations with 55,000 
22
electric vehicle direct current fast charging plugs 
23
available in the United States. Estimates by the Na-
24
tional Renewable Energy Laboratory suggest that, 
25
04:02 Feb 07, 2020
H5770
3 
•HR 5770 IH
by 2050, between 106,000 and 138,000 stations 
1
with 343,000 and 447,000 plugs could be needed to 
2
meet consumer demand. 
3
(5) Failure to expand access to publicly acces-
4
sible electric vehicle chargers will prevent the wider 
5
adoption of electric vehicles and, therefore, hinder 
6
progress towards a more sustainable transportation 
7
system. According to a study produced by the Michi-
8
gan Energy Office and Michigan State University, 
9
‘‘limited charging infrastructure for electric vehicles 
10
has been one of the main barriers in adopting these 
11
vehicles’’. 
12
(6) Expediting the wider adoption of electric ve-
13
hicles will require considerable changes to consumer 
14
behavior, which will not be possible without the cre-
15
ation of necessary infrastructure. According to a 
16
study produced by the Transportation Research 
17
Board and National Research Council, ‘‘adoption 
18
and diffusion of new innovations can be a long-term, 
19
complicated process that is especially slow for prod-
20
ucts that cost tens of thousands of dollars and where 
21
consumers have questions about infrastructure avail-
22
ability, resale value, and other variables’’, and ‘‘a 
23
perception of a lack of public charging infrastructure 
24
might hinder [plug-in electric vehicle] deployment.’’ 
25

•HR 5770 IH
Thus, greatly expanding access to publicly accessible 
1
electric vehicle chargers will be essential to changing 
2
consumer behavior radically and, accordingly, accel-
3
erating the wider adoption of electric vehicles. 
4
(b) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act is to estab-
5
lish a network of electric vehicle charging stations along 
6
eligible roads so that the United States may lead the world 
7
in protecting the environment while improving consumer 
8
experiences. The implementation of this Act will encourage 
9
the widespread adoption of light-, medium-, and heavy- 
10
duty electric vehicles by— 
11
(1) eliminating ‘‘range anxiety’’; 
12
(2) allowing drivers to charge vehicles more 
13
quickly; and 
14
(3) ensuring that vehicle charging is equitably 
15
accessible and reasonably priced, enabling long-dis-
16
tance travel along eligible roads. 
17
(c) DEFINITIONS.—In this Act: 
18
(1) ELIGIBLE ROAD.—The term ‘‘eligible road’’ 
19

•HR 5770 IH
(1) The distance between publicly available 
1
EVSE locations. 
2

12
publicly available EVSE location, accounting for 
13
dense corridors where multiple stations or a greater 
14
number of charging ports at the location are nec-
15
essary and for rural corridors where special consid-
16
erations will need to be made for less dense corridors 
17
that will still require publicly available EVSE place-
18
ment.

(7) The long-term operation and maintenance 
1
of publicly available EVSE, including consideration

7
EVSE placement off of eligible roads.

(11) Publicly available EVSE placement and 
17
construction in communities in which climate 
18
change, pollution, or environmental destruction have
