Whereas Lori Gilbert Kaye, a founding member of the con-
gregation, was killed while bravely saving the life of 
Rabbi Goldstein; 
Whereas, in describing the attack, Rabbi Goldstein said— 
(1) ‘‘Lori took the bullet for all of us. She died to 
protect all of us’’; and 
(2) ‘‘This is Lori. This is her legacy, and her legacy 
will continue. It could have been so much worse.’’; 
Whereas Oscar Stewart, a veteran of the Army, and Jona-
than Morales, a border patrol agent, bravely fought back, 
running toward the perpetrator of the attack; 
Whereas law enforcement and first responders, including the 
San Diego Sheriff’s Department, acted quickly and pro-
fessionally to respond to the attack and care for the vic-
tims; 
Whereas the perpetrator of the attack, who expressed White 
supremacist and White nationalist sentiments, entered 
the synagogue shouting anti-Semitic slurs; 
Whereas the attack occurred 6 months to the day after the 
attack on the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, 
Pennsylvania, which killed 11 innocent people and in-
jured 6 others, including 4 law enforcement officers; 
Whereas anti-Semitism is an age-old form of prejudice, dis-
crimination, persecution, and marginalization of Jewish 
people that runs counter to the values of the United 
States; 
Whereas, according to an annual audit conducted by the 
Anti-Defamation League, in 2018— 
(1) anti-Semitic incidents remained at near-historic 
levels in the United States; and

(2) the number of anti-Semitic incidents with known 
connections to extremists or inspired by extremist ide-
ology reached the highest levels since 2004; 
Whereas, in a manifesto attributed to the perpetrator of the 
attack, the perpetrator of the attack claimed responsi-
bility for the burning of a mosque in Escondido, Cali-
fornia, and demonstrated anti-Muslim bias; 
Whereas growing White supremacy and White nationalism 
is— 
(1) a threat to the security of the United States; 
and 
(2) antithetical to the American values of dignity 
and respect of all people, including Jewish, Muslim, 
Black, Latino, Asian American, immigrant, and LGBTQ 
peoples; and 
Whereas hate has no place in the United States and there is 
a duty to condemn all forms of hatred: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) condemns the horrific anti-Semitic attack
