5

holdover and short-term lease extensions, in-
7
cluding short firm term leases; 
8
(B) improving office space utilization rates 
9
of Federal tenants; and 
10
(C) streamlining and simplifying the leas-
11
ing process to take advantage of real estate 
12
markets; and

14
backlog of expiring leases over the next 5 years.

(1) 
SIMPLIFIED

20
special simplified procedures for acquisitions of 
21
leasehold interests in real property at rental rates 
22
that do not exceed the simplified lease acquisition 
23

24
rate under a multiyear lease does not exceed the

simplified lease acquisition threshold if the average 
1
annual amount of the rent payable for the period of 
2
the lease does not exceed such threshold.

4
of this section, the simplified lease acquisition 
5

11

12

13
3307(b), subject to the following requirements: 
14
(1) COST PER SQUARE FOOTAGE.—The cost per 
15

16
posed rental rate designated for the respective geo-
17
graphical area. 
18
(2) SPACE
UTILIZATION.—The overall space

•HR 3158 IH
(4) GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION.—The geographical 
1
location is identified as having a large amount of 
2
square footage of Federal office space and lease 
3
turnover and will likely result in providing for the 
4
ability, on a timely basis, of the agency to consoli-
5
date space effectively or meet any requirements for 
6
temporary or interim space required for planned 
7
consolidations. 
8
(5) 
SUBMARKETS.—Agencies 
may 
consider 
9
space in submarket locations that meet mission re-
10
quirements.

12
trator may consolidate more than one project into a single 
13
prospectus submitted pursuant to section 3307(b) of title 
14
40, United States Code, if such consolidation will facilitate 
15
efficiencies and reductions in overall space and improved 
16
utilization rates. 
17
(f) WAIVER AUTHORITY.—The Administrator may— 
18
(1) waive notice and comment rulemaking, if 
19
the Administrator determines the waiver is necessary 
20
to implement this section expeditiously; and 
21
