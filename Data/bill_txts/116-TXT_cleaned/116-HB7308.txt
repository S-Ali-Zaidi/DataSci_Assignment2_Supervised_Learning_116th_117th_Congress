A BILL 
To authorize appropriations for offsetting the costs related 
to reductions in research productivity resulting from the 
coronavirus pandemic. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 7308 IH
(1) Agencies provided Federal research grantees 
1
flexibility during the pandemic to support graduate 
2
students, postdocs, principal investigators, and tech-
3
nical support staff. 
4
(2) Agencies will need to provide current Fed-
5
eral research grants extensions to cover time lost in 
6
research labs and in the field that will impact the 
7
completion of that agency’s research missions and 
8
priorities. Additionally, agencies allowed federally 
9
funded labs to donate necessary equipment, like per-
10
sonal protective equipment among others, to support 
11
hospitals and first responders, which will need to be 
12
re-purchased and will create additional expenses to 
13
Federal contracts. 
14
(3) The need to ensure the United States sus-
15
tains the critical human infrastructure that under-
16
girds the United States research enterprise, which 
17
has created a longstanding government-university 
18
partnership which has made America the global 
19
leader in innovation, strengthening the health of our 
20
Nation’s citizens, economy, and national security. 
21
(4) While the Federal Government has made 
22
significant investments in new research to address 
23
COVID–19, existing research has been slowed down

or stopped due to COVID–19 modified operations of 
1
campuses and laboratories. 
2
(5) Given the modified operations of many uni-
3
versity-based and national laboratories due to the 
4
pandemic, Congress is concerned that the people 
5
who comprise the research workforce—graduate stu-
6
dents, postdocs, principal investigators, and tech-
7
nical support staff—and the future health and 
8
strength of the United States research enterprise 
9
and manufacturing and technology economies, 
10
among others, are at risk. 
11
(6) While our Nation’s research capacity has 
12
demonstrated it can absorb shocks and pivot to ad-
13
dress immediate national threats, the scale of this 
14
pandemic is still growing and unprecedented in du-
15
ration and impact. 
16
(7) Without funding, future innovations in 
17
areas such as quantum, artificial intelligence, robot-
18
ics, computing, 5G, space exploration, digital agri-
19
culture, cancer, and aging will be forestalled while 
20
the agencies are forced to use future appropriations 
21
for new research, meant to create new knowledge 
22
leading to the next generation of discoveries, to 
23
cover existing grants. The Nation must innovate to 
24
launch the next 50 years of unparalleled economic

leadership and be prepared for any future pandem-
1
ics. 
2
(8) Therefore, Congress believes it is vital that 
3
the Federal Government take measures to help re-
4
lieve the strain agencies will be forced to face and 
5
sustain the strength of our Nation’s ability to re-
6
main a global leader in an increasingly competitive 
7
global research environment, as other countries con-
8
tinue to make disproportionately large investments 
9
in key research areas.
