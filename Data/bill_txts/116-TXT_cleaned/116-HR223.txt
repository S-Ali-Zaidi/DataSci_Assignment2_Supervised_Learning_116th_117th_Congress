ous and credible’’;

the Western Sahara territory and called for the ‘‘imme-
diate withdrawal’’ of the Polisario Front from portions of 
the Western Sahara and for the group ‘‘to refrain from 
[any] destabilizing actions’’;

ering diplomatic ties with Iran due to its purported sup-
port, along with that of the Lebanon-based Hezbollah mi-
litia, for the Polisario Front;
