RESOLUTION 
Recognizing Black History Month and the contributions of 
Harlem to American history and culture. 
Whereas the celebration of Black History Month every Feb-
ruary is an integral way to recognize and appreciate the 
multitude of progress that has been made in the African- 
American community; 
Whereas during Black History Month, we reflect upon the 
works and teachings of historic figures such as Harriet 
Tubman, Ella Fitzgerald, James Brown, James Baldwin, 
Madam C.J. Walker, Malcolm X, Maya Angelou, and 
Langston Hughes, to the modern day contributions of 
civil rights leaders and icons of the 21st century includ-

erend Al Sharpton, Henry Louis Gates, Jr., Ava 
DuVernay, Oprah Winfrey, and many others; 
Whereas Black History Month is celebrated in communities 
around the Nation and especially throughout New York’s 
13th Congressional District with its rich culture of inclu-
sion and diverse heritage, and particularly in Harlem 
neighborhood, which is recognized around the Nation and 
the world for its historic landmarks and legacy of social 
revolution and artistic expression of the African-Amer-
ican community; 
Whereas Harlem, specifically, has made immense contribu-
tions to America’s culture and historical foundations due 
to individuals such as Langston Hughes, W.E.B. Du 
Bois, Duke Ellington, Romare Bearden, Zora Neale 
Hurston, and many more key figures; and 
Whereas Black History Month gives us a platform to recog-
nize the numerous parts of our country that would not 
be present today without the contributions of the African- 
American people in the areas of music, arts and enter-
tainment, education and technology, business and policy, 
and our Nation’s Armed Forces: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—

contributions of Harlem to American history and

culture; and 
4
(2) recognizes the fact that there is much more

improvement that is yet to be made, and our efforts

must continue to ensure equal representation and di-

versity within our Nation’s workforce, to address the
