To impose sanctions with respect to Turkey, and for other 
purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Protect Against Con-
4
flict by Turkey Act’’ or the ‘‘PACT Act’’.

SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
6
It is the sense of Congress that— 
7
(1) the United States and Turkey have been 
8
treaty allies since 1952, when Turkey became a

•HR 4695 IH
member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
1
(NATO); 
2
(2) being a NATO member means that Turkey 
3
is treaty bound to safeguard the principles of democ-
4
racy, individual liberty, and the rule of law, and im-
5
portantly, should be united with other NATO allies 
6
in efforts for collective defense and the preservation 
7
of peace and security; 
8
(3) Turkey’s military invasion of northern Syria 
9
on October 9, 2019, is an unacceptable and unneces-
10
sary escalation of tensions with the potential to 
11
cause a severe humanitarian crisis and undo the col-
12
lective gains made in the fight against the Islamic 
13
State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) by the United States 
14
and the 81 countries and organizations of Global 
15
Coalition to Defeat ISIS, including NATO and the 
16
European Union (EU); 
17
(4) Turkey should immediately cease attacks 
18
against the Syrian Democratic Forces, Kurdish and 
19
Arab civilians, and other religious and ethnic minor-
20
ity communities in northern Syria and recall its 
21
forces back to Turkey; 
22
(5) targeted sanctions against Turkey are an 
23
appropriate response in order for Turkey to be held

•HR 4695 IH
accountable for its military invasion of northern 
1
Syria; 
2
(6) Turkey’s military invasion of northern Syria 
3
is the latest example of the weakening and problem-
4
atic United States-Turkey bilateral relationship and 
5
undermines the security of the United States and its 
6
NATO allies, including that of Turkey; and 
7
(7) the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have 
8
been critical partners to the United States and allied 
9
counter-ISIS and broader counterterrorism efforts in 
10
Syria.
