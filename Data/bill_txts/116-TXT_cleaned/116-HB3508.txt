SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
3
Congress makes the following findings: 
4
(1) According to the Asia-Pacific Maritime Se-
5
curity Strategy issued by the Department of Defense 
6
in August 2015, ‘‘Although the United States takes 
7
no position on competing sovereignty claims to land 
8
features in the region, all such claims must be based 
9
upon land (which in the case of islands means natu-
10
rally formed areas of land that are above water at 
11
high tide), and all maritime claims must derive from 
12
such land in accordance with international law.’’. 
13
(2) According to the annual report of the De-
14
partment of Defense to Congress on the military 
15
power of the People’s Republic of China submitted 
16
01:56 Jul 09, 2019
H3508
3 
•HR 3508 IH
in April 2016, ‘‘Throughout 2015, China continued 
1
to assert sovereignty claims over features in the 
2
East and South China Seas. In the East China Sea, 
3
China continued to use maritime law enforcement 
4
ships and aircraft to patrol near the Senkaku 
5
(Diaoyu) Islands in order to challenge Japan’s 
6
claim. In the South China Sea, China paused its 
7
land reclamation effort in the Spratly Islands in late 
8
2015 after adding more than 3,200 acres of land to 
9
the seven features it occupies in the archipelago. Al-
10
though these artificial islands do not provide China 
11
with any additional territorial or maritime rights 
12
within the South China Sea, China will be able to 
13
use them as persistent civil-military bases to en-
14
hance its long-term presence in the South China Sea 
15
significantly.’’. 
16
(3) On May 30, 2015, at the Shangri-la Dia-
17
logue of the International Institute for Strategic 
18
Studies, Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter stated 
19
that ‘‘with its actions in the South China Sea, China 
20
is out of step with both the international rules and 
21
norms that underscore the Asia-Pacific’s security ar-
22
chitecture, and the regional consensus that favors di-
23
plomacy and opposes coercion’’.

(4) On July 24, 2015, Admiral Harry Harris, 
1
Jr., noted at a forum in Colorado that each year 
2
more than $5,300,000,000,000 in global sea-based 
3
trade passes through the South China Sea. 
4
(5) On June 4, 2016, at the Shangri-la Dia-
5
logue, Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter stated: 
6
‘‘[T]he United States will stand with regional part-
7
ners to uphold core principles, like freedom of navi-
8
gation and overflight and the peaceful resolution of 
9
disputes through legal means and in accordance with 
10
international law. As I affirmed here last year, and 
11
America’s Freedom of Navigation Operations in the 
12
South China Sea have demonstrated, the United 
13
States will continue to fly, sail and operate wherever 
14
international law allows, so that everyone in the re-
15
gion can do the same.’’. 
16
(6) On July 12, 2016, the Permanent Court of 
17
Arbitration’s Tribunal organized pursuant to the 
18
United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea 
19
issued its unanimous award in the arbitration insti-
20
tuted by Republic of the Philippines against the Peo-
21
ple’s Republic of China. The Tribunal noted that its 
22
award is final and binding under that Convention. 
23
(7) Also according to the award, the Tribunal 
24
‘‘concluded that, to the extent China had historical 
25
01:56 Jul 09, 2019
H3508
5 
•HR 3508 IH
rights to resources in the waters of the South China 
1
Sea, such rights were extinguished to the extent they 
2
were incompatible with the exclusive economic zones 
3
provided for in the Convention. The Tribunal con-
4
cluded that there was no legal basis for China to 
5
claim historic rights to resources within the sea 
6
areas falling within the ‘nine-dash line’.’’. 
7
(8) Also according to the award, the Tribunal 
8
‘‘held that the Spratly Islands cannot generate mari-
9
time zones collectively as a unit. Having found that 
10
none of the features claimed by China was capable 
11
of generating an exclusive economic zone, the Tri-
12
bunal found that it could—without delimiting a 
13
boundary—declare that certain sea areas are within 
14
the exclusive economic zone of the Philippines, be-
15
cause those areas are not overlapped by any possible 
16
entitlement of China.’’. 
17
(9) Also according to the award, the Tribunal 
18
‘‘found that China had violated the Philippines’ sov-
19
ereign rights in its exclusive economic zone by (a) 
20
interfering with Philippine fishing and petroleum ex-
21
ploration, (b) constructing artificial islands, and (c) 
22
failing to prevent Chinese fishermen from fishing in 
23
the zone. The Tribunal also held that fishermen 
24
from the Philippines (like those from China) had 
25
05:29 Jul 10, 2019
H3508
6 
•HR 3508 IH
traditional fishing rights at Scarborough Shoal and 
1
that China had interfered with these rights in re-
2
stricting access. The Tribunal further held that Chi-
3
nese law enforcement vessels had unlawfully created 
4
a serious risk of collision when they physically ob-
5
structed Philippine vessels.’’. 
6
(10) On July 12, 2016, the Ministry of Foreign 
7
Affairs of the People’s Republic of China issued a 
8
statement that China ‘‘declares that the [Tribunal] 
9
award is null and void and has no binding force. 
10
China neither accepts nor recognizes it. . . . China’s 
11
territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and inter-
12
ests in the South China Sea shall under no cir-
13
cumstances be affected by those awards. China op-
14
poses and will never accept any claim or action 
15
based on those awards.’’. 
16
(11) On July 12, 2016, the Government of the 
17
People’s Republic of China issued the fifth state-
18
ment in the name of that Government since 1979 
19
that— 
20
(A) stated that the People’s Republic of 
21
China has sovereignty over the 4 rocks and 
22
shoals in the South China Sea; 
23
(B) claims internal waters, territorial seas, 
24
contiguous zones, one or more exclusive eco-

•HR 3508 IH
nomic zones, and a continental shelf based on 
1
that sovereignty claim; and 
2
(C) continues to claim historic rights in 
3
the South China Sea. 
4
(12) On July 12, 2016, Assistant Secretary of 
5
State and Department of State Spokesperson John 
6
Kirby noted that the ‘‘United States strongly sup-
7
ports the rule of law. We support efforts to resolve 
8
territorial and maritime disputes in the South China 
9
Sea peacefully, including through arbitration. . . . 
10
we urge all claimants to avoid provocative state-
11
ments or actions. This decision can and should serve 
12
as a new opportunity to renew efforts to address 
13
maritime disputes peacefully.’’. 
14
(13) On July 13, 2016, the Vice Foreign Min-
15
ister of the People’s Republic of China, Liu 
16
Zhenmin, said that declaring an air defense identi-
17
fication zone in the South China Sea would depend 
18
on the threat China faces and stated that ‘‘[i]f our 
19
security is threatened, we of course have the right 
20
to set it up’’. 
21
(14) On July 18, 2016, the People’s Liberation 
22
Army Air Force of the People’s Republic of China 
23
stated that it had conducted a ‘‘combat air patrol’’ 
24
over the South China Sea and that it would become 
25
01:56 Jul 09, 2019
H3508

•HR 3508 IH
‘‘regular practice’’ in the future. A spokesperson 
1
stated that the People’s Liberation Army Air Force 
2
‘‘will firmly defend national sovereignty, security and 
3
maritime interests, safeguard regional peace and 
4
stability, and cope with various threats and chal-
5
lenges’’. 
6
(15) On August 2, 2016, the Supreme People’s 
7
Court of the People’s Republic of China issued a ju-
8
dicial interpretation that people caught illegally fish-
9
ing in Chinese waters could be jailed for up to one 
10
year. 
11
(16) In the Agreement concerning the Ryukyu 
12
Islands and the Daito Islands with Related Arrange-
13
ments, signed at Washington and Tokyo June 17, 
14
1971 (23 UST 446), between the United States and 
15
Japan (commonly referred to as the ‘‘Okinawa Re-
16
version Treaty’’), the United States agreed to apply 
17
the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security, with 
18
Agreed Minute and Exchanges of Notes (11 UST 
19
1632), signed at Washington January 19, 1961, be-
20
tween the United States and Japan, to the area cov-
21
ered by the Okinawa Reversion Treaty, including the 
22
Senkaku Islands. 
23
(17) In April 2014, President Barack Obama 
24
stated, ‘‘The policy of the United States is clear— 
25
01:56 Jul 09, 2019

•HR 3508 IH
the Senkaku Islands are administered by Japan and 
1
therefore fall within the scope of Article 5 of the 
2
U.S.-Japan Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Secu-
3
rity. And we oppose any unilateral attempts to un-
4
dermine Japan’s administration of these islands.’’. 
5
(18) In February 2017, President Donald 
6
Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe 
7
issued a joint statement that ‘‘affirmed that Article 
8
V of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Mutual Cooperation 
9
and Security covers the Senkaku Islands’’.
