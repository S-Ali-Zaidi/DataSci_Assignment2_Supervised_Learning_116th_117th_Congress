(a) EVALUATION.—Not later than 18 months after 
3
the date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator of 
4
the Federal Railroad Administration, in coordination with 
5
the Administrator of the Pipeline and Hazardous Mate-
6
rials Safety Administration, shall conduct an evaluation 
7
of the safety, security, and environmental risks of trans-
8
porting liquefied natural gas by rail. 
9
(b) TESTING.—In conducting the evaluation under 
10
subsection (a), the Administrator of the Federal Railroad 
11
Administration shall— 
12
(1) perform physical testing of rail tank cars, 
13
including, at a minimum, the DOT–113 specifica-
14
tion, to ensure such rail tank cars are able to with-
15
stand the effects of an accident or impact and pre-
16
vent or mitigate the release of liquefied natural gas; 
17
(2) analyze multiple release scenarios, including 
18
derailments, front-end collisions, rear-end collisions, 
19
side-impact 
collisions, 
grade-crossing 
collisions, 
20
punctures, and impact of an incendiary device, at a 
21
minimum of 3 speeds of travel with a sufficient 
22
range of speeds to evaluate the safety, security, and 
23
environmental risks posed under real-world oper-
24
ating conditions; and

(3) examine the effects of exposure to climate 
1
conditions across rail networks, including tempera-
2
ture, humidity, and any other factors that the Ad-
3
ministrator of the Federal Railroad Administration 
4
determines could influence performance of the inner 
5
or outer walls of rail tank cars. 
6
(c) OTHER FACTORS TO CONSIDER.—In conducting 
7
the evaluation under subsection (a), the Administrator of 
8
the Federal Railroad Administration shall evaluate the im-
9
pact of a discharge of liquefied natural gas from a rail 
10
tank car on public safety and the environment, and con-
11
sider— 
12
(1) the benefits of route restrictions, speed re-
13
strictions, enhanced brake requirements, personnel 
14
requirements, rail tank car technological require-
15
ments, and other operating controls; 
16
(2) the advisability of consist restrictions, in-
17
cluding limitations on the arrangement and quantity 
18
of rail cars carrying liquefied natural gas in any 
19
given consist; 
20
(3) the identification of potential impact areas, 
21
and the number of homes and structures that would 
22
be endangered by a discharge in rural, suburban, 
23
and urban environments;

(4) the impact of discharge on the environment,

including examining environmentally sensitive areas

with rail tracks that move through them; 
3
(5) the benefits of advanced notification to the 
4
Department of Transportation, State Emergency 
5
Response Commissions, and Tribal Emergency Re-
6
sponse Commissions of routes for moving liquefied 
7
natural gas by rail tank car; 
8
(6) how first responders respond to a discharge, 
9
including the extent to which specialized equipment 
10
or training would be required and the cost to com-
11
munities for acquiring any necessary equipment or 
12
training; 
13
(7) whether thermal radiation could occur from 
14
a discharge; 
15
(8) an evaluation of rail tank cars authorized 
16
by the Secretary of Transportation, a determination 
17
of which rail tank car would provide the best out-
18
come in the event of a discharge, and a determina-
19
tion of whether a new standard is necessary to en-
20
sure the safety of rail transport of liquefied natural 
21
gas; and
