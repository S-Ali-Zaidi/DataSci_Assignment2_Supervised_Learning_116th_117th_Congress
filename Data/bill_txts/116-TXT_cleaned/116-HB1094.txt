SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The national security of the United States 
3
continues to depend on language readiness, in par-
4
ticular among the seventeen agencies of the Intel-
5
ligence Community. 
6
(2) The levels of language proficiency required 
7
for national security necessitate long sequences of 
8
language training for personnel in the Intelligence 
9
Community and the Department of Defense. 
10
(3) The future national security and economic 
11
well-being of the United States will depend substan-
12
tially on the ability of its citizens to communicate 
13
and compete by knowing the languages and cultures 
14
of other countries. 
15
(4) The Federal Government has an interest in 
16
ensuring that the employees of its departments and 
17
agencies with national security responsibilities are 
18
prepared to meet the challenges of this changing 
19
international environment. 
20
(5) The Federal Government also has an inter-
21
est in taking actions to alleviate the problem of 
22
American students being inadequately prepared to 
23
meet the challenges posed by increasing global inter-
24
action among nations.
