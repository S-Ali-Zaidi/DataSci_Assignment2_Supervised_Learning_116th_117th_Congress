as determined by State fish and wildlife agencies, and 
for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Recovering America’s 
4
Wildlife Act of 2019’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) The populations of several species of wildlife 
8
across America are in crisis. The Nation’s efforts to 
9
recover at-risk wildlife populations are not keeping 
10
pace with the increased demand for natural re-
11
sources and threats to native wildlife, including dis-
12
ease, invasive species, habitat loss and fragmenta-
13
tion, shifts in temperature ranges, and extreme 
14
weather. More than 150 species are presumed ex-
15
tinct, another 500 are likely extinct, and more than 
16
12,000 species are designated as species of greatest 
17
conservation need, including more than 700 wildlife 
18
species in the United States that are already listed 
19
as threatened or endangered under the Endangered 
20
Species Act. An assessment of the best-known 
21
groups of United States wildlife and plants indicates 
22
that one-third of America’s species are vulnerable to 
23

extinction and one-fifth imperiled and at high-risk of 
1
extinction. 
2
(2) A diverse array of species of fish and wild-
3
life is of significant value to the United States for 
4
aesthetic, ecological, educational, cultural, rec-
5
reational, economic, and scientific reasons. 
6
(3) More than 100 million citizens of the 
7
United States participate in outdoor recreation 
8
through hunting, fishing, birding, and other wildlife- 
9
dependent recreation, all of which have significant 
10
value to the citizens who engage in those activities 
11
and provide economic benefits to local communities. 
12
(4) It is in the interest of the United States— 
13
(A) to retain for present and future gen-
14
erations the opportunity to hunt, fish, observe, 
15
understand, and appreciate a wide variety of 
16
fish and wildlife; 
17
(B) to recover species of fish and wildlife 
18
listed as threatened species or endangered spe-
19
cies under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 
20
(16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) and to prevent fish 
21
and wildlife species from declining to the point 
22
of requiring Federal protection under such Act; 
23
and 
24

•HR 3742 IH
(C) to support collaborative and proactive 
1
conservation that will sustain the diverse fish 
2
and wildlife populations of the United States. 
3
(5) The first nongovernmental conservation or-
4
ganizations to instill fish and wildlife conservation 
5
values in hunters, anglers, bird watchers, and all 
6
citizens were founded during the 1880s to 1890s at 
7
the behest of hunters and anglers, including Theo-
8
dore Roosevelt and naturalist George Bird Grinnell, 
9
who were alarmed that game and sportfish could not 
10
sustain unregulated harvest and that avifauna need-
11
ed protection from commercial take. 
12
(6) At the turn of the 20th century, the 
13
States— 
14
(A) realized the need to regulate the har-
15
vest of game and sportfish for sustainable use; 
16
(B) required hunters and anglers to obtain 
17
licenses and established regulations for game 
18
seasons, bag and creel limits, and legal means 
19
of take for game and sportfish; and 
20
(C) used the funds received for such li-
21
censes largely for enforcement of such regula-
22
tions. 
23
(7) In 1937, an alliance between hunters and 
24
conservation organizations, States, the Federal Gov-
25

ernment, and the shooting sports industry convinced 
1
Congress to transfer to the States receipts from an 
2
existing Federal excise tax on sporting arms and 
3
ammunition, matched by State hunting license dol-
4
lars, for the management of wildlife and conserva-
5
tion of habitat under the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife 
6
Restoration Act (16 U.S.C. 669 et seq.), which 
7
greatly enhanced the States’ ability to move from 
8
primarily enforcing game seasons and bag limits to 
9
science-based research and management of wildlife. 
10
(8) In 1951, an alliance between anglers and 
11
conservation organizations, States, the Federal Gov-
12
ernment, and the sportfishing industry convinced 
13
Congress to impose a Federal excise tax on fishing 
14
equipment under the Dingell-Johnson Sportfish Res-
15
toration Act (16 U.S.C. 777 et seq.) and to transfer 
16
to the States such receipts, matched by State fishing 
17
license revenues, to manage sportfish and conserve 
18
aquatic habitats, enhancing the State fish and wild-
19
life department’s ability to use science-based re-
20
search and management of fish species. 
21
(9) Such user-pay, public-benefits means of 
22
funding fish and wildlife conservation are unique in 
23
the world, having been started in the United States 
24
by sportsmen and sportswomen who were willing to 
25
02:39 Jul 23, 2019
H3742
6 
•HR 3742 IH
pay these fees to ensure dedicated funds went to fish 
1
and wildlife conservation delivered by the States. 
2
(10) Such user-pay funds (licenses and excise 
3
taxes)— 
4
(A) have benefitted not only hunters and 
5
anglers, but all citizens of the United States by 
6
providing abundant fish and wildlife (including 
7
both game and nongame species), clean water, 
8
outdoor recreation, healthy activities, and qual-
9
ity of life; and 
10
(B) provide, and will continue to provide, 
11
a majority of the funds that are available to 
12
State fish and wildlife departments for science- 
13
based research and management of fish and 
14
wildlife. 
15
(11) State fish and wildlife agencies are respon-
16
sible for the conservation and management of all 
17
fish and wildlife in the State, but are grossly under-
18
funded because there are few funds available at the 
19
State level for fish and wildlife conservation, except 
20
those driven by hunting and fishing license revenues 
21
and Federal excise tax revenues. 
22
(12) Congress created a subaccount known as 
23
the Wildlife Conservation and Restoration Sub-
24
account under section 3(a)(2) of the Pittman-Rob-
25

2
wildlife conservation needs identified by State fish 
3
and wildlife departments, including for species that 
4
are not hunted or fished, but only authorized appro-
5
priations for the Subaccount for one year. 
6
(13) While some appropriated funds have been 
7
made available through related programs, the lack of 
8
assured and sufficient dedicated funding for the 
9
Wildlife Conservation and Restoration Subaccount 
10
has left unrealized the goals of the Subaccount, 
11
thereby allowing fish and wildlife populations to con-
12
tinue to decline across the United States and result-
13
ing in hundreds of species being listed as threatened 
14
species or endangered species under the Endangered 
15
Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.). 
16
(14) Under the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife 
17
Restoration Act (16 U.S.C. 669 et seq.), each State 
18
and territory is required to seek public input and

produce a comprehensive fish and wildlife conserva-
