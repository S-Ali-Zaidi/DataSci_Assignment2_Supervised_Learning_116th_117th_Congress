SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be referred to as the ‘‘Wage Equity 
2
Act of 2019’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
(1) In 1963, Congress passed on a bipartisan 
5
basis the Equal Pay Act of 1963 to prohibit dis-
6
crimination on account of sex in the payment of 
7
wages for equal work performed by employees for 
8
employers engaged in commerce or in the production 
9
of goods for commerce. 
10
(2) Following the passage of such Act, in 1964, 
11
Congress passed on a bipartisan basis the Civil 
12
Rights Act of 1964. Since the passage of both the 
13
Equal Pay Act of 1963 and the Civil Rights Act of 
14
1964, women have made significant strides, both in 
15
the workforce and in their educational pursuits. 
16
(3) Currently, there are nearly 75,000,000 
17
women in the workforce, the most in American his-
18
tory. Of the 2,800,000 jobs created in 2018, 58 per-
19
cent went to women. This follows a trend that has 
20
been rising for some time. Women are graduating 
21
from college at a higher rate than their male counter 
22
parts, making up over 58 percent of all college de-
23
grees conferred in 2017. Additionally, according to a 
24
recent survey of working women, 49 percent of em-
25
ployed women are their family’s primary bread-

winner. Women hold the majority of positions in the 
1
five fastest growing fields. 
2
(4) Despite these advances there is still concern 
3
among the American public that gender-based pay 
4
discrimination has not been eliminated.
