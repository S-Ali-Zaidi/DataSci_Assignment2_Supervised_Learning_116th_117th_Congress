RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the designation of August 7 through 
14, 2020, as World Mask Week, and encouraging all 
Americans to wear appropriate face coverings to protect 
themselves and to protect older Americans or others with 
health conditions that increase the risks of serious illness 
due to COVID–19. 
Whereas cloth face coverings, or nonmedical masks, serve as 
a barrier to SARS–CoV–2-carrying droplets, helping to 
prevent the spread of COVID–19 and save lives; 
Whereas a substantial portion of people infected with SARS– 
CoV–2 are asymptomatic or presymptomatic and can

transmit the virus to others when they do not know they 
are infected; 
Whereas research conducted long before the COVID–19 pan-
demic has shown the utility of wearing masks in pro-
viding protection against the transmission of respiratory 
infections; 
Whereas various types of cloth masks, including masks made 
of cotton, gauze, and other fabrics, reduced infection 
rates among health care workers and others during the 
Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918 and the Manchurian 
plague of 1920 through 1921, and were used by health 
care workers and others to protect against tuberculosis in 
the 1930s and 1940s; 
Whereas a model projection of COVID–19 deaths by the In-
stitute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the Univer-
sity of Washington showed if 95 percent of people in the 
United States wore a mask in public spaces, nearly 
34,000 fewer people would die from the disease; 
Whereas, on April 3, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention recommended all individuals two years of 
age and older and medically able to wear a mask, wear 
nonmedical, cloth masks in public settings and when 
around people who don’t live in their household; 
Whereas a survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention from May 11 through May 13, 2020, 
found that 76 percent of adults support mask-wearing 
outside of the home; 
Whereas a study published by the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention on July 17, 2020, found no sec-
ondary cases of COVID–19 in 139 mask-wearing clients

of two mask-wearing hair stylists with confirmed cases of 
COVID–19; 
Whereas to suppress COVID–19 transmission, the World 
Health Organization advises governments to encourage 
the general public to use nonmedical cloth masks as part 
of a comprehensive disease control strategy in areas of 
widespread transmission; 
Whereas countries in Southeast Asia with a strong mask- 
wearing culture like Japan and the Republic of South 
Korea have been far more successful in controlling 
COVID–19, experiencing few cases and lower mortality 
levels without instituting severe restrictions on their pop-
ulations; 
Whereas raising awareness about the effectiveness of every-
one wearing cloth masks when in public would encourage 
the adoption of mask-wearing, help to prevent the spread 
of COVID–19, and save lives both at home and abroad; 
Whereas one recent economic analysis estimated that uni-
versal masking could save five percent of GDP, or one 
trillion dollars, by making lockdowns unnecessary and 
getting people back to work earlier; and 
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and 
the Pandemic Action Network are partnering with more 
than 40 organizations to host World Mask Week from 
August 7 through 14, 2020, in an effort to increase the 
use of face coverings across the globe: Now, therefore, be 
it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
