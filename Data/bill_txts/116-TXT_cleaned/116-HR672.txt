RESOLUTION 
Expressing support of the Three Seas Initiative in its efforts 
to increase energy independence and infrastructure 
connectivity thereby strengthening the United States and 
European national security. 
Whereas, in 2015, 12 Central and European nations of the 
European Union established the Three Seas Initiative to 
increase energy autonomy and resilience through support 
of collective financing for new infrastructure projects to 
connect the region between the Adriatic, Baltic, and 
Black Seas;

Whereas the United States pledged support and willingness 
to serve as a steadfast partner of the Three Seas Initia-
tive’s effort at the July 2017 Warsaw summit; 
Whereas the Three Seas Initiative will advance economic 
growth, resilience, and energy security in this strategic 
region, thereby increasing the national security of the 
United States; 
Whereas the President of the European Commission recog-
nized the Three Seas Initiative as a ‘‘catalyst for the co-
hesion and convergence of the EU and for the strength-
ening of the transatlantic link’’; 
Whereas Soviet-imposed communist rule in Central and East-
ern Europe left the region with a significant infrastruc-
ture deficit, especially in the realm of north-south trans-
portation and energy lines; 
Whereas the current state of infrastructure in Central and 
Eastern Europe nations restricts energy, water, and tele-
communications interconnectivity across the region; 
Whereas the infrastructure deficit leaves these nations overly 
dependent on Russia for their energy and additional eco-
nomic needs; 
Whereas Russia seeks to undermine democratic institutions 
and liberty in Europe through hybrid means, including 
using energy as a tool for coercion; 
Whereas Russian gas pipeline projects, such as Nord Stream 
II and Turk Stream, are political and seek to undermine 
Europe’s energy security; 
Whereas diversification of energy sources and supply routes, 
including development of renewable energy sources and 
technology, is critical to bolstering energy security;
