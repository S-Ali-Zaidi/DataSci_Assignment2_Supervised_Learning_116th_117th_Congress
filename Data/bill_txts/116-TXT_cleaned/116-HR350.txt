RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the value and importance of the Electoral 
College. 
Whereas the framers of the Constitution of the United States 
established the Electoral College in article II, section 1 
of the Constitution, America’s founding document; 
Whereas the Electoral College serves as a formal body which 
elects the President and Vice President of the United 
States, and each State has a number of electors based on 
the State’s number of Representatives and Senators; 
Whereas the Electoral College is unique to our Federal re-
public and provides representation to an American popu-
lation comprised of different cultures, religions, and eco-
nomic backgrounds;

•HRES 350 IH 
Whereas the United States is not a homogeneous Nation, but 
historically a Nation of immigrants requiring a unique 
electoral structure like the Electoral College; and 
Whereas the Electoral College encourages the smooth transi-
tion of power and maintains our American system of gov-
ernment that protects against the tyranny of the major-
ity: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) recognizes that the Electoral College pre-
2
serves the concept of federalism; 
3
(2) recognizes that the Electoral College is 
4
uniquely American; and 
5
(3) recognizes that the Electoral College is vital 
6
to the continued preservation of our government.
