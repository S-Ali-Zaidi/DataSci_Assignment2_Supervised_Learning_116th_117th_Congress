•HR 3061 IH
(1) Research shows that mentors make a dif-
1
ference in young people’s lives. At-risk youth who 
2
have mentors are 55 percent more likely to enroll in 
3
college. Students who meet regularly with their men-
4
tors are 52 percent less likely than their peers to 
5
skip a day of school. Youth who have mentors are 
6
also 130 percent more likely to hold a leadership po-
7
sition. 
8
(2) Young people that have mentors have im-
9
proved relationships with adults, fewer disciplinary 
10
referrals, and more confidence to achieve their goals. 
11
(3) In 2017, 442,995 youth were in foster care. 
12
Of those youth 70,858 were between the ages of 10 
13
and 13, and 101,983 were between the ages of 14 
14
and 20. 
15
(4) Mentoring programs that serve foster youth 
16
are unique and require additional considerations, in-
17
cluding specialized training and support necessary to 
18
provide for consistent, long-term relationships for 
19
children in foster care. 
20
(5) Mentoring programs can be used as an ef-
21
fective preventative or intervention strategy to sup-
22
port positive outcomes for foster youth.
