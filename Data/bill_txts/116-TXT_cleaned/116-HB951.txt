ficial partnership focused on enhancing the tourism 
1

6

7
which represented a 3 percent growth from 2015. 
8
(4) Tourist activity to the United States from

10
to an overall international tourism industry increase 
11
in the United States. 
12
(5) In 2017, international tourist arrivals to-
13
taled 76,900,000, up 0.7 percent from 76,400,000 in 
14

15
(6) The same year, 77,000,000 international 
16

17
el, food, and souvenirs, a 2-percent increase over

20

21
Mexico, comprising a loss of 1,166,585 Mexican 
22

the United States, but a corresponding monetary de-
1
cline would be approximately $1.24 billion in lost 
2
revenue. 
3
(9) This is a critical economic trend given that 
4
Mexico is the biggest source of international visitors 
5
to the United States after Canada.
