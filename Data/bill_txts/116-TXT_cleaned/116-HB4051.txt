A BILL 
To create a Climate Action Rebate Fund in order to effi-
ciently reduce greenhouse gas emissions, provide a 
monthly rebate to the American people, encourage inno-
vation of clean energy technologies and create new eco-
nomic opportunities, ensure the resiliency of our infra-
structure, assist with the transition to a clean energy 
economy, and leave a healthier, more stable, and more 
prosperous nation for future generations.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Climate Action Rebate 
4
Act of 2019’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
The Congress finds that— 
7
(1) climate change is costing the United States 
8
billions of dollars of economic losses and poses an 
9
existential threat to our safety and security; 
10
(2) markets should reflect all costs of goods, in-
11
cluding external factors such as pollution; and 
12
(3) creation of a Climate Action Rebate Fund 
13
can make markets more efficient, create jobs, stimu-
14
late innovation, invest in infrastructure, put money 
15
back in the pockets of Americans, and provide for 
16
the transition to a cleaner energy future.
