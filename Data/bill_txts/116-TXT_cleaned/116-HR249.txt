RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for Ukraine in its upcoming elections

Whereas in an effort to undermine democracy in Ukraine, 
Russian hackers targeted the country’s voting infrastruc-
ture just days before its 2014 Presidential election; 
Whereas the Government of the Russian Federation con-
tinues to undermine democratic processes and institu-
tions in Ukraine and threatens the peace, security, sta-
bility, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of Ukraine, in-
cluding through its illegal occupation of Crimea and parts 
of eastern Ukraine;

niques to seek to influence public opinion across Europe 
and Eurasia’’; 
Whereas in the 2019 Worldwide Threat Assessment of the 
United States Intelligence Community, Director of Na-
tional Intelligence Daniel Coats stated, ‘‘Russia’s inter-
ception of Ukrainian ships in the Kerch Strait and deten-
tion of the ships’ sailors in November 2018 demonstrates 
Russia’s willingness to limit Ukrainian freedom of navi-
gation in the area and exert political pressure on the 
country’s leadership, particularly in advance of Ukraine’s 
elections this year . . . Russia is taking steps to influ-
ence these elections, applying a range of tools to exert in-
fluence and exploit Kyiv’s fragile economy, widespread 
corruption, cyber vulnerabilities, and public discontent in 
hopes of ousting Poroshenko and bringing to power a less 
anti-Russia Parliament’’; 
Whereas Ukraine will hold its Presidential election on March 
31, 2019, and parliamentary elections in the fall of 2019; 
and 
Whereas, on March 6, 2019, Ukraine reported thwarting at-
tempts of the Russian Federation to organize hacker at-
tacks on Ukrainian state agencies tasked with preparing 
and conducting the elections: Now, therefore, be it
