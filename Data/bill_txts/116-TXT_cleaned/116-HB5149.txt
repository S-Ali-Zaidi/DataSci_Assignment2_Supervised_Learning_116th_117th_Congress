7
(2) due to the significant benefits that observa-
8
tion missions under the Open Skies Treaty provide 
9
to the United States and United States allies, the 
10
United States should commit to continued participa-
11
tion in the Treaty; and

13
United States from the Open Skies Treaty.

15
It is the policy of the United States— 
16
(1) to continue to fulfill its obligations under

(2) consistent with section 5, to reject any ef-
19
forts to withdraw the United States from the Open 
20
Skies Treaty, or to indirectly withdraw from the 
21
Open Skies Treaty in a manner that creates a de 
22
facto withdrawal.

ures, has been developed.
