1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The recent signing of the Abraham Accords 
3
and establishment of full diplomatic relations be-
4

5
Israel represents a historic step towards perusing 
6
peace and security for all peoples in the Middle East 
7
region. 
8
(2) Israel remains the most important and most 
9
reliable strategic ally of the United States in the 
10
Middle East. 
11
(3) The enactment of the United States-Israel 
12
Strategic Partnership Act of 2014 (Public Law 113– 
13
296) established Israel as a major strategic partner 
14
of the United States. 
15
(4) Certain countries and non-state actors in 
16
the Middle East region have been at war, both de-
17
clared and undeclared, with Israel since its founding 
18
in 1948. 
19
(5) For more than 50 years, the United States 
20
has worked to ensure Israel’s qualitative military 
21
edge when considering the sale or export of defense 
22
articles and defense services to Israel or to others in

security, and has been a vital consideration in all

previous sales of weapons to the region.

4
lished and reaffirmed several times in law.

6
signed a 10-year Memorandum of Understanding, in 
7
which the United States committed that ‘‘the acqui-
8
sition of additional U.S.-produced capabilities and 
9
technology provide the best means to ensure Israel

preserves its Qualitative Military Edge (QME)’’.

13
sistent with long established United States law and in sup-
14
port of one of the most important United States allies, 
15
must ensure that any sale or export of defense articles 
16
or defense services to countries in the Middle East region 
17
does not in any way adversely affect Israel’s qualitative 
18
military edge.
