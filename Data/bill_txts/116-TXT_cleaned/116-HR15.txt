RESOLUTION 
Calling upon any agreement reached between the President 
and Vladimir Putin at their meeting in Helsinki, Fin-
land, to be approved by Congress. 
Whereas the strength of the American constitutional system 
designed in 1787 in Philadelphia is the National Govern-
ment’s separated powers in which the legislative, execu-
tive, and judicial branches serve as checks and counter-
balances on each other, and fidelity to the rule of law is 
the highest value and responsibility; 
Whereas United States intelligence agencies concluded in 
2016 that Russia was behind an effort to tip the scale 
of the United States Presidential election against Demo-
cratic Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, with a

tion (FBI) opened an investigation into the hacking of 
the Democratic National Committee’s emails, which the 
United States intelligence community would attribute to 
the Russian Government; 
Whereas an Intelligence Community Assessment (ICA) issued 
in January 2017 concluded that Russian efforts to influ-
ence the 2016 United States Presidential election rep-
resented the most recent expression of the Russian gov-
ernment’s longstanding objective to undermine the 
United States-led Western Alliance and international 
democratic order, and that these activities demonstrated 
a significant escalation in directness, level of activity, and 
scope of effort compared to previous operations; 
Whereas the ICA assessed that Russian Federation President 
Vladimir Putin ordered a disinformation campaign in 
2016 aimed at influencing the outcome of the United 
States Presidential election and that Russia’s goals were 
to undermine public faith in the United States demo-
cratic process, undermine the Presidential campaign of 
Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, and facilitate the 
election of President Putin’s preferred candidate, Donald 
J. Trump; 
Whereas Russian interference in the election processes of 
democratic countries is not new but instead a continu-
ation of the ‘‘Translator Project’’, an ongoing informa-
tion warfare effort launched by Russian Federation 
President Putin in 2014 to use social media to manipu-
late public opinion and voters in Western democracies;

emails that are missing,’’ referring to Secretary of State

Whereas at the meeting in Helsinki, Finland, rather than em-
bracing the conclusions of the intelligence community, the

Putin in heaping scorn on the ICA regarding Russian in-
terference and called Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s in-
vestigation into Russia’s interference ‘‘the greatest polit-
ical witch hunt in history’’; 
Whereas at their postmeeting joint press conference in Hel-
sinki, President Putin stated that in order for him to per-
mit the Special Counsel to question the 12 Russian mili-

making available for interrogation by Russian authorities

of the United States nonetheless characterized favorably

Whereas prior to the July 2018 meeting in Helsinki, Finland, 
Americans have become increasingly concerned regarding 
the cozy relationship between the President of the United 
States and the leader of its most formidable adversary, 
President Putin, whose actions or conduct the President

Whereas according to media reports the President of the 
United States did not raise with President Putin the 
causes contributing to United States-Russia tension, in-
cluding Russia’s annexation of Crimea and support for 
the rebels in Ukraine, its continued support of the Assad 
regime in Syria, its interference in the elections in the 
United States and Europe, the nerve agent poisonings in
