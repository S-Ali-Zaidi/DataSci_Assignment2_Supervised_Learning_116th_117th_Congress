Whereas Cesar Chavez believed that preventing illegal immi-
gration was an essential prerequisite to improving the cir-
cumstances of American farmworkers; 
Whereas, in 1969, Chavez led a march to the Mexican border 
to protest illegal immigration, joined by Senator Walter 
Mondale and Martin Luther King’s successor as head of 
the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, Ralph 
Abernathy; 
Whereas Chavez noted that it is ‘‘almost impossible to start 
some effective program to get these people their jobs 
back from the braceros’’ once employers replace them; 
Whereas, in the 1970s, Chavez combined a campaign of iden-
tifying and reporting illegal workers with a campaign to 
boycott nonunionized farms in order to protect the labor 
of the unionized American worker; 
Whereas Chavez recognized that flooding the labor market 
with people from abroad undermines the unionized Amer-
ican worker; 
Whereas, in 1979, at the National Press Club, Chavez em-
phatically supported enforcement of immigration laws, 
stating that ‘‘people are being hurt and being destroyed, 
and with the complicity and with the help, of the Federal 
Government’’; and 
Whereas President Clinton recognized Chavez’s work saying, 
‘‘We can be proud of his enormous accomplishments and 
in the dignity and comfort he brought to the lives of so 
many of our country’s least powerful and most dispos-
sessed workers’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
