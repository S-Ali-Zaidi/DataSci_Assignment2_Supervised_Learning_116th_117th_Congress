SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Good transition services are critical to the 
3
success of youth with disabilities transitioning from 
4
school to employment. 
5
(2) Federal law, including the Individuals with 
6
Disabilities Education Act and the Workforce Inno-
7
vation and Opportunity Act, require that schools and 
8
adult disability systems (including the State voca-
9
tional rehabilitation agency (or agencies), the State 
10
developmental disabilities agency, the State mental 
11
health agency, and the State Medicaid agency) col-
12
laborate to ensure the successful transition of stu-
13
dents from school to competitive integrated employ-
14
ment. 
15
(3) The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity 
16
Act requires States to provide preemployment transi-
17
tion services to students with disabilities, with the 
18
goal of assisting with the transition to competitive 
19
integrated employment. 
20
(4) Despite the goals of Federal laws, schools 
21
and State systems continue to have challenges 
22
transitioning students with intellectual, develop-
23
mental, mental health, and other significant disabil-
24
ities and such students continue to achieve the goal 
25
of competitive integrated employment at far lower

rates than their non-disabled peers and even peers 
1
with other disabilities. Only 24 percent of transition- 
2
aged youth with disabilities are employed and only 
3
21 percent of youth with intellectual or develop-
4
mental disabilities are employed (according to Cor-
5
nell University). This leads to fewer adults with dis-
6
abilities working. The most current data indicate 
7
that while 74 percent of working age adults with no 
8
disability are working, only 35 percent of adults with 
9
disabilities, and only 25 percent of adults with cog-
10
nitive disabilities, are working (according to the 
11
American Community Survey). 
12
(5) Schools and State systems should have 
13
knowledge and expertise in the range of evidence- 
14
based strategies that are particularly effective for 
15
employment of students with disabilities, including 
16
customized employment, the Individual Plan and 
17
Support model, and supported employment.
