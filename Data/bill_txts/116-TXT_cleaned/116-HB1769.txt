SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds as follows: 
2
(1) Dairy products are an important part of a 
3
healthy diet for both children and adults, according 
4
to the 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans 
5
(referred to in this section as the ‘‘Dietary Guide-
6
lines’’) published by the Department of Health and 
7
Human Services and the Department of Agriculture. 
8
The Dietary Guidelines state that most Americans 
9
are not meeting recommended intake for the dairy 
10
food group. Consumption of dairy foods provides nu-
11
merous health benefits, including lowering the risk 
12
of diabetes, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular dis-
13
ease, and obesity. 
14
(2) The Dietary Guidelines state that dairy 
15
foods are excellent sources of critical nutrients for 
16
human health, including vitamin D, calcium, and po-
17
tassium, all of which are under consumed by people 
18
of the United States. When consumed in the 
19
amounts recommended by the Food Patterns of the 
20
Department of Agriculture, on average across the 
21
calorie levels, dairy foods contribute about 67 per-
22
cent of calcium, 64 percent of vitamin D, and 17 
23
percent of magnesium. 
24
(3) About 30 percent of adolescent boys meet or 
25
exceed the recommended 3-cup equivalents per day, 
26

•HR 1769 IH
but less than 10 percent of adolescent females meet 
1
or exceed this recommendation. An age-related de-
2
cline in dairy intake appears to begin in adolescence 
3
and intakes persist at very low levels among adult 
4
females across the age distribution. Less than 5 per-
5
cent of adult females consume the recommended 3- 
6
cup equivalents per day. Overall, more than 80 per-
7
cent of the entire population of the United States 
8
does not meet the daily dairy intake recommenda-
9
tion. 
10
(4) The Dietary Guidelines state that vitamin 
11
D and potassium amounts vary across plant-based 
12
milk alternatives. The amount of calcium per calorie 
13
is lower for most plant-based alternative milk prod-
14
ucts. To obtain the amount of calcium contained in 
15
one cup of non-fat fluid milk from a plant-based 
16
milk alternative, the portion size and calorie intake 
17
must be greater. 
18
(5) Imitation dairy products, such as plant- 
19
based products derived from rice, nuts, soybeans, 
20
hemp, coconut, algae, and other foods that imitate 
21
milk, yogurt, and cheese, often do not provide the 
22
same nutrition content as real milk, cheese, and yo-
23
gurt derived from dairy cows. 
24

•HR 1769 IH
(6) Plant-based products labeled as milk are 
1
misleading to consumers. 
2
(7) The Food and Drug Administration has 
3
regulations that define milk and cream as the ‘‘lac-
4
teal secretion, practically free from colostrum, ob-
5
tained by the complete milking of one or more 
6
healthy cows’’ (section 131.110 of title 21, Code of 
7
Federal Regulations). This definition further applies 
8
to milk used to create other dairy products, includ-
9
ing yogurt and cheese, as specified in sections 131 
10
and 133 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations. 
11
(8) Given the proliferation of plant-based prod-
12
ucts in the marketplace that are mislabeled as milk 
13
despite the standard of identity defined for this sub-
14
stance, enforcement by the Food and Drug Adminis-
15
tration against these practices should be improved to 
16
avoid misleading consumers. 
17
SEC. 3. PURPOSE. 
18
No food may be introduced or delivered for introduc-
19
tion into interstate commerce using a market name for 
20
a dairy product if the food does not meet the criterion 
21
set forth for dairy products under paragraph (z)(2) of sec-
22
tion 403 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act 
23
(21 U.S.C. 343) (as added by section 4(a)).
