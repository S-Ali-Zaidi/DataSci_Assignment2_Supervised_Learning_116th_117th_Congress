RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for designation of the month of 
September as ‘‘National Voting Rights Month’’. 
Whereas voting is one of the single most important rights 
that can be exercised in our democracy; 
Whereas over the course of history, various voter suppression 
laws in the United States have hindered, and even pro-
hibited, certain individuals and groups from exercising 
this right; 
Whereas during the 19th and early 20th centuries, many Na-
tive Americans and Americans who were born abroad, 
many individuals who did not speak or write English, and 
many who were formerly subjected to slavery, were de-
nied full citizenship and prevented from voting by 
English literacy tests; 
Whereas since the 1870s, minority groups such as African 
Americans in the South suffered from the oppressive ef-
fects of Jim Crow laws designed to prevent political, eco-
nomic, and social mobility; 
Whereas African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, Na-
tive Americans, and other underrepresented groups were 
subject to violence, poll taxes, literacy tests, all-White pri-
maries, property ownership tests, and grandfather 
clauses; 
Whereas members of the aforementioned groups and others 
are currently, in some cases, subject to intimidation, 
voter roll purges, bans on former prisoners from voting, 
and financial barriers that act effectively as modern day 
poll taxes;

•HRES 556 IH 
Whereas in 1965, Congress passed the Voting Rights Act of 
1965 to protect the rights of African Americans and 
other traditionally disenfranchised groups to vote, among 
other reasons; 
Whereas in 2013, the Supreme Court invalidated section 4 of 
the Voting Rights Act of 1965, dismantling the 
preclearance provision in the law that protected voters in 
States and local governments that historically have sup-
pressed the rights of minorities to vote; 
Whereas since the preclearance provisions of the Voting 
Rights Act of 1965 have been vacated, among other ef-
fects, many States’ gerrymandered districts have gone 
unchallenged or have become less likely to be invalidated 
by the courts; 
Whereas these gerrymandered districts have been found to 
have a discriminatory impact on traditionally disenfran-
chised minorities through tactics that include ‘‘cracking’’, 
diluting their voting power across many districts, and 
‘‘packing’’, concentrating minority voters’ power in one 
district to reduce their voting power in other districts; 
Whereas the courts have found the congressional and, in 
some cases, State legislative district maps in Texas, 
North Carolina, Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Wis-
consin to be gerrymandered districts that were created to 
favor some groups over others; 
Whereas the Shelby County v. Holder Supreme Court deci-
sion calls on Congress to update the formula in the Vot-
ing Rights Act of 1965 to better match current data; 
Whereas in 22 States, some form of restrictive voting law has 
been instituted since 2013;

•HRES 556 IH 
Whereas these restrictive voting laws encompass cutbacks in 
early voting, voter roll purges, placement of faulty equip-
ment in minority communities, requirement of photo 
identification—the procurement of which amounts to a 
modern day poll tax,—and elimination of same-day reg-
istration; 
Whereas these changes could outright disenfranchise or make 
voting much more difficult for more than 80 million mi-
nority, elderly, poor, and disabled voters, among other 
groups; 
Whereas in 2016 alone, discriminatory laws in North Caro-
lina, Wisconsin, North Dakota, and Texas were ruled to 
violate voters’ rights and overturned by the courts; 
Whereas there is much more work to be done to ensure all 
Americans have the right to vote; 
Whereas National Voter Registration Day is September 25; 
and 
Whereas the month of September would be an appropriate 
month to designate as ‘‘National Voting Rights Month’’: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the designation of ‘‘National Vot-
2
ing Rights Month’’; 
3
(2) encourages all people in the United States 
4
to uphold the right of every American to exercise his

(3) encourages Congress to pass—
