SEC. 412. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS ON THE NEED FOR A 
12
NEW GREAT LAKES ICEBREAKER. 
13
(a) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds the following: 
14
(1) The Great Lakes shipping industry is cru-
15
cial to the American economy, including the U.S. 
16
manufacturing base, providing important economic 
17
and national security benefits. 
18
(2) A recent study found that the Great Lakes 
19
shipping industry supports 237,000 jobs and tens of 
20
billions of dollars in economic activity. 
21
(3) United States Coast Guard icebreaking ca-
22
pacity is crucial to full utilization of the Great Lakes 
23
shipping system, as during the winter icebreaking 
24
season up to 15 percent of annual cargo loads are 
25
03:25 Jun 25, 2019
H3409
83 
•HR 3409 IH
delivered and many industries would have to reduce 
1
their production if Coast Guard icebreaking services 
2
were not provided. 
3
(4) Six of the Coast Guard’s nine icebreaking 
4
cutters in the Great Lakes are more than 30 years 
5
old and are frequently inoperable during the winter 
6
icebreaking season, including those that have com-
7
pleted a recent service life extension program. 
8
(5) During the previous 10 winters, Coast 
9
Guard Great Lakes icebreaking cutters have been in-
10
operable for an average of 65 cutter-days during the 
11
winter icebreaking season, with this annual lost ca-
12
pability exceeding 100 cutter-days, with a high of 
13
246 cutter-days during the winter of 2017–2018. 
14
(6) The 2019 ice season provides further proof 
15
that current Coast Guard icebreaking capacity is in-
16
adequate for the needs of the Great Lakes shipping 
17
industry, as only six of the nine icebreaking cutters 
18
are operational and millions of tons of cargo was not 
19
loaded or was delayed due to inadequate Coast 
20
Guard icebreaking assets during a historically aver-
21
age winter for Great Lakes ice coverage. 
22
(7) The Congress has authorized the Coast 
23
Guard to acquire a new Great Lakes icebreaker as 
24
capable as Coast Guard Cutter MACKINAW 
25
03:25 Jun 25, 2019

•HR 3409 IH
(WLBB–30), the most capable Great Lakes ice-
1
breaker, and $10 million has been appropriated to 
2
fund the design and initial acquisition work for this 
3
icebreaker. 
4
(8) The Coast Guard has not initiated a new 
5
acquisition program for this Great Lakes icebreaker. 
6
(b) SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
7
the Congress of the United States that a new Coast Guard 
8
icebreaker as capable as Coast Guard Cutter MACKI-
9
NAW (WLBB–30) is needed on the Great Lakes and the 
10
Coast Guard should acquire this icebreaker as soon as pos-
11
sible.
