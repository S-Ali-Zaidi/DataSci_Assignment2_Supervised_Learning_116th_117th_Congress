Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Grand Jury Reform 
4
Act of 2020’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
The Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Grand juries are typically used as the proc-
8
ess by which allegations of police misconduct are 
9
prosecuted. 
10
(2) There exists a symbiotic relationship be-
11
tween local prosecutors and the law enforcement of-
12
ficers who regularly testify in routine grand jury in-
13
vestigations. 
14
(3) The closeness of this relationship creates 
15
public suspicion that accused police officers receive 
16
preferential consideration from grand juries when 
17
they are subject to grand jury investigations. 
18
(4) Police officers have the right to appear be-
19
fore the grand jury investigating allegations of 
20
wrongdoing by said officer, and give testimony not 
21
subject to a thorough cross examination. 
22
(5) Grand jury proceedings are by law secret 
23
proceedings. 
24

•HR 5779 IH
(6) The secret grand jury process has histori-
1
cally resulted in a refusal to indict when the subject 
2
of their investigation is a local law enforcement offi-
3
cer. 
4
(7) The recent grand jury proceedings following 
5
the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner have 
6
followed historical tradition, ending with a refusal to 
7
indict the law enforcement officers involved in their 
8
deaths. 
9
(8) The American people have lost confidence in 
10
the secretive grand jury process when it is used to 
11
evaluate allegations of police misconduct. 
12
(9) The loss of confidence in our system of jus-
13
tice leads to the undermining of the principles of 
14
equality and justice upon which this country was 
15
founded. 
16
(10) Preliminary hearings are often replaced 
17
with direct presentments, whereby the prosecutor 
18
may send a case directly to the grand jury without 
19
a public preliminary hearing.
