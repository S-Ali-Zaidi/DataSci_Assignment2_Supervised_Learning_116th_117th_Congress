RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the designation of September 2020 
as ‘‘National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month’’. 
Whereas an estimated 3,170,399 men in the United States 
live with prostate cancer; 
Whereas according to the National Cancer Institute, the per-
centage of newly diagnosed prostate cancer cases in men 
under 65 has significantly increased and stands at 41.9 
percent;

Whereas 1 in 9 men in the United States will be diagnosed 
with prostate cancer in his lifetime; 
Whereas prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed 
nonskin cancer and the second-leading cause of cancer- 
related deaths among men in the United States; 
Whereas the American Cancer Society estimates that in 
2020, 191,930 men will be diagnosed with, and more 
than 33,330 men will die of, prostate cancer; 
Whereas the odds of developing prostate cancer rise rapidly 
after age 50; 
Whereas African-American men suffer from a prostate cancer 
incidence rate that is significantly higher than that of 
White men and have more than double the prostate can-
cer mortality rate than that of White men; 
Whereas men who are exposed to hazardous chemicals may 
be at a higher risk for prostate cancer; 
Whereas some veterans are at an increased risk of prostate 
cancer due to chemical or radiation exposure during mili-
tary service; 
Whereas a study conducted at the Portland VA Medical Cen-
ter and Oregon Health and Science University found that 
veterans exposed to Agent Orange were at an increased 
risk for both developing prostate cancer and developing 
more aggressive forms of the disease; 
Whereas having a father or brother with prostate cancer 
more than doubles the risk of a man developing prostate 
cancer, with a higher risk for men who have a brother 
with the disease and the highest risk for men with several 
affected relatives;

•HRES 1118 IH 
Whereas screening by a digital rectal examination and a pros-
tate-specific antigen blood test can detect the disease at 
the earlier, more treatable stages, which could increase 
the chances of survival for more than 5 years to nearly 
100 percent; 
Whereas prostate cancer is almost always diagnosed with a 
needle biopsy where the prostate is mapped and tissue 
cores are removed from at least a dozen sites; 
Whereas even with state-of-the-art laboratory techniques and 
specimen tracking, peer-reviewed literature reports that 
as many as 2.5 percent of prostate biopsy patients are 
affected by biopsy tissue switching or contamination lead-
ing to misdiagnosis; 
Whereas misdiagnosis can result in inappropriate overtreat-
ment or undertreatment of men; 
Whereas only 30 percent of men survive more than 5 years 
if diagnosed with prostate cancer after the cancer has 
metastasized; 
Whereas there are no noticeable symptoms of prostate cancer 
in the early stages, making appropriate screening critical; 
Whereas ongoing research promises further improvements in 
prostate cancer prevention, early detection, and treat-
ment; and 
Whereas educating people in the United States, including 
health care providers, about prostate cancer and early de-
tection strategies is crucial to saving the lives of men and 
preserving and protecting families: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
