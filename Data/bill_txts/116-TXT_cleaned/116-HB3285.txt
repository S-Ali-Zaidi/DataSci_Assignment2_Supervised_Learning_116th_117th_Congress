To provide for a grant program for handgun licensing 
programs, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Handgun Purchaser 
4
Licensing Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds as follows: 
7
(1) In 2017, 91 percent of firearm homicides in 
8
the United States in which firearm type was speci-
9
fied were committed with handguns.

(2) Research by top national experts shows that 
1
handgun purchaser licensing laws are associated 
2
with significant reductions in firearm-related homi-
3
cides. Research on the effects of Connecticut’s adop-
4
tion of a handgun purchaser licensing law in 1995 
5
was associated with a 40-percent reduction in the 
6
rate of firearm homicide and a 15-percent reduction 
7
in firearm suicide rates during the first 10 years the 
8
law was in place. Published research has shown that 
9
Missouri’s repeal of its handgun purchaser licensing 
10
law in 2007 was associated with an increase in fire-
11
arm homicide rates in the state of 27 percent and 
12
a 16-percent increase in suicides committed with 
13
firearms. 
14
(3) In States which have had effective handgun 
15
purchaser licensing laws for decades, such as Con-
16
necticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York, 
17
the vast majority of guns traced to crimes originated 
18
in other States, which supports the need for hand-
19
gun purchaser licensing laws in every State.
