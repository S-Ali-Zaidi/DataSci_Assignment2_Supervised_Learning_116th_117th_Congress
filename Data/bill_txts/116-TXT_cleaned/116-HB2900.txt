A BILL 
To establish the United States Chief Manufacturing Officer 
in the Executive Office of the President with the respon-
sibility of developing a National Manufacturing Strategy 
to revitalize the manufacturing sector, spur economic 
growth, and expand United States competitiveness, and 
for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Chief Manufacturing 
2
Officer Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
4
(a) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) The manufacturing sector consists of estab-
6
lishments that are primarily engaged in the trans-
7
formation of materials, substances, or components 
8
into products. 
9
(2) A healthy, innovative manufacturing base 
10
plays a central role in the United States economy 
11
and national defense. 
12
(3) The Federal Government supports manufac-
13
turing in a variety of ways; support for manufac-
14
turing-related activities are dispersed across several 
15
agencies in the executive branch. 
16
(4) Manufacturing employment, output, and ex-
17
ports are impacted by a myriad of factors including 
18
the state of infrastructure and transportation, tax 
19
policies, environmental and other business regula-
20
tions, trade policies, innovation ecosystems, work-
21
force development, and education initiatives. Legisla-
22
tion and executive actions can have unintended im-
23
pact on the growth of manufacturing in the United 
24
States. 
25

•HR 2900 IH
(5) Manufacturers account for 11 percent of 
1
the total gross domestic product output in the 
2
United States, employing 8 percent of the workforce. 
3
Total output from manufacturing is more than 2 
4
trillion dollars. There are nearly 13 million manufac-
5
turing employees in the United States, with an aver-
6
age annual compensation of about $80,000. 
7
(6) Given that 99 percent of manufacturing 
8
firms are small and medium size enterprises with a 
9
predominantly local employment footprint, workforce 
10
development programs must be rooted in local cir-
11
cumstance and requirements. 
12
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
13
gress that a well-designed National Manufacturing Strat-
14
egy would benefit the United States economy in several 
15
important ways, including the following: 
16
(1) A revitalized manufacturing sector would 
17
enable the United States to increase its economic 
18
growth from domestic and export production. 
19
(2) Manufacturing jobs continue to pay higher 
20
wages and benefits than non-manufacturing jobs. 
21
Average domestic wages would rise in response to 
22
growing manufacturing output. 
23
(3) Manufacturing industries undertake two- 
24
thirds of private-sector research and development, 
25
21:03 Jun 06, 2019
H2900

•HR 2900 IH
which fuels the innovation that serves as a primary 
1
engine of economic growth. A growing manufac-
2
turing sector would help lay the foundations for fu-
3
ture economic expansion. 
4
(4) The United States would expand its long- 
5
standing leadership in advanced manufacturing tech-
6
nologies with Federal investments in manufacturing 
7
research and development, education, and workforce 
8
training. 
9
(5) There exists a longstanding connection be-
10
tween domestic manufacturing, national defense, and 
11
homeland security. A strong and innovative manu-
12
facturing industry will maintain the technical superi-
13
ority of the United States military and secure supply 
14
chain integrity.
