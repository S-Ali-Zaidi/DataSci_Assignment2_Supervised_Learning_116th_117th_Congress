Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Achieving Lasting 
4
Electoral Reforms on Transparency and Security Act’’ or 
5
the ‘‘ALERTS Act’’. 
6
SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
7
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds as follows: 
8
(1) Free and fair elections are central to our 
9
democratic system of government. 
10
(2) An attack on election systems in the United 
11
States by a foreign government is a hostile act, and 
12
protecting our election systems from such attacks is 
13
a critical national security objective. 
14
(3) The March 2019 ‘‘Report on the Investiga-
15
tion into Russian Interference in the 2016 Presi-
16
dential Election’’, known as the Mueller Report, con-
17
cludes that Russian military intelligence officers tar-
18
geted individuals and entities involved in the admin-
19
istration of the November 2016 elections, including 
20
State boards of elections, Secretaries of State, coun-
21
ty governments, and private technology firms re-
22
sponsible for manufacturing and administering elec-
23
tion-related software and hardware.

•HR 3529 IH
(4) The Mueller Report states that Russian 
1
military intelligence officers sent spearphishing 
2
emails to over 120 email accounts used by Florida 
3
county officials responsible for administering the 
4
2016 elections, and further states that the Federal 
5
Bureau of Investigation ‘‘believes that this operation 
6
enabled Russian military intelligence officers to gain 
7
access to the network of at least one Florida county 
8
government’’. 
9
(5) In May 2019, it came to light that Russian 
10
military intelligence officers had gained access to the 
11
computer network of a second Florida county in the 
12
run-up to the 2016 elections. 
13
(6) To date, government officials have not pub-
14
licly disclosed or confirmed the identity of the Flor-
15
ida counties whose voter registration systems were 
16
breached. 
17
(7) As a result, voters in affected counties do 
18
not possess the information necessary to take appro-
19
priate responsive action, such as taking affirmative 
20
steps to confirm that their individual registration 
21
data is accurate and holding State and local election 
22
officials accountable for their actions or inactions. 
23
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
24
gress that the principal victim of an attack on election 
25

•HR 3529 IH
systems in the United States is the voting public and, ex-
1
cept in certain narrowly defined cases, the voting public 
2
should be promptly informed if Federal officials have cred-
3
ible evidence of an unauthorized intrusion into an election 
4
system and a basis to believe that such intrusion could 
5
have resulted in voter information systems or voter tabula-
6
tion systems being altered or otherwise affected.
