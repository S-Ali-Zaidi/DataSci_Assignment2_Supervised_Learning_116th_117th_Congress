legal assistance (including assistance related to pretrial

(c) POINT SYSTEM FOR PREFERENCE FACTORS.—In 
12
awarding grants under this section, the Secretary shall— 
13
(1) establish a system that awards points to ap-
14
plicants in accordance with the preference factors 
15
described in subsection (d); and

17

19
for which an applicant shall be awarded points under the

system established pursuant to subsection (c)(1) are as

rates of eviction. In making such determinations, the 
1
Secretary shall use data determined by the Secretary

4
mine the rate of eviction in a census tract. The Sec-
5
retary may not require applicants to provide data on 
6
the rates of eviction in the census tract in which the 
7
applicant intends to provide services or award more 
8
points to applicants who provide such data than to 
9
applicants who do not. 
10
(2) CAPACITY PREFERENCE.—If the Secretary 
11
determines that the applicant has a greater capacity 
12
to produce more favorable outcomes regarding evic-
13
tion for eligible tenants. In making such determina-
14
tions, the Secretary may consider the applicant’s— 
15
(A) past experience in producing favorable 
16
outcomes for households facing eviction; 
17
(B) proposed use of grant funds to in-
18
crease staff resources to provide legal assist-

(E) ability to effectively communicate with

2
(3) PREFERENCE FOR GOVERNMENT ENTITIES 
3
THAT PROMOTE TENANT RIGHTS.—With respect to 
4
any applicant that is a governmental entity, if the 
5
applicant has in effect laws or regulations that pro-
6

9
tablishing a tenant’s right to— 
10
(i) counsel in evictions cases; 
11
(ii) withhold rent if a landlord fails to 
12
provide essential services to ensure habit-
13
ability of the premises; 
14
(iii) deduct appliance repair costs 
15

19
to one month’s rent; and 
20

21
curity deposit after terminating a lease;

3
(ii) advance notice of landlord entry to 
4
the property; or

(iii) adequate time to recover aban-
6
doned property after eviction.

Points awarded under this paragraph shall not re-
8
sult in an applicant governmental entity being 
9
awarded a grant that, in the absence of this para-
10
graph, would have been awarded to either an appli-
11
cant nonprofit entity or an applicant governmental 
12
entity lacking the legal authority to enact laws or 
13
regulations described in this paragraph because such 
14
entity is subject to legal restrictions enacted by an-
15
other governmental entity. 
16
(e) RURAL EQUITY.—In awarding grants under this 
17
section, the Secretary— 
18
(1) shall, to the extent practicable, ensure that 
19
the proportion of eligible tenants living in rural
