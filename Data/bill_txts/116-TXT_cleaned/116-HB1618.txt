•HR 1618 IH
(1) Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas 
1
produced by burning any fuel. Exposure to un-
2
healthy levels of carbon monoxide can lead to carbon 
3
monoxide poisoning, a serious health condition that 
4
could result in death. 
5
(2) Unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning 
6
from motor vehicles and the abnormal operation of 
7
fuel-burning appliances, such as furnaces, water 
8
heaters, portable generators, and stoves, kills more 
9
than 400 people each year and sends more than 
10
15,000 to hospital emergency rooms for treatment. 
11
(3) Research shows that purchasing and install-
12
ing carbon monoxide alarms close to the sleeping 
13
areas in residential homes and other dwelling units 
14
can help avoid fatalities. 
15
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
16
gress that Congress should promote the purchase and in-
17
stallation of carbon monoxide alarms in residential homes 
18
and dwelling units nationwide in order to promote the 
19
health and public safety of citizens throughout the United 
20
States.
