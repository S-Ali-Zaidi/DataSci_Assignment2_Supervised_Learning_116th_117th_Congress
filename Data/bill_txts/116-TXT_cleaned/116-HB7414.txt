SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSES. 
6
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) The Taiwan Relations Act (Public Law 96– 
8
8; 22 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.) affirmed United States 
9
policy ‘‘to preserve and promote extensive, close, and 
10

tween the people of the United States and the people 
1
on Taiwan, as well as the people on the China main-
2
land and all other peoples of the Western Pacific 
3
area’’. 
4
(2) Consistent with the Asia Reassurance Ini-
5
tiative Act of 2018 (Public Law 115–409), the 
6
United States has grown its strategic partnership 
7
with Taiwan’s vibrant democracy of 23,000,000 peo-
8
ple. 
9
(3) Despite a concerted campaign by the Peo-
10
ple’s Republic of China to isolate Taiwan from its 
11
diplomatic partners and from international organiza-
12
tions, including the World Health Organization, Tai-
13
wan has emerged as a global leader in the 
14
coronavirus global pandemic response, including by 
15
donating more than 2,000,000 surgical masks and 
16
other medical equipment to the United States. 
17
(4) The creation of a United States fellowship 
18
program with Taiwan would support a key priority 
19
of expanding people-to-people exchanges, which was 
20
outlined in the President’s 2017 National Security 
21
Strategy. 
22
(b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this Act are— 
23
(1) to further strengthen the United States-Tai-
24
wan strategic partnership and broaden under-
25

standing of the Indo-Pacific region by temporarily 
1
assigning officials of any branch of the United 
2
States Government to Taiwan for intensive study in 
3
Mandarin and placement as Fellows with Taiwan 
4
central authorities or a Taiwanese civic institution; 
5
(2) to provide for eligible United States per-
6
sonnel to learn Mandarin Chinese and expand their 
7
understanding of the political economy of Taiwan 
8
and the Indo-Pacific region; 
9
(3) to better position the United States to ad-
10
vance its economic, security, and human rights in-
11
terests in the Indo-Pacific region; and 
12
(4) to encourage further expansion of other 
13
people-to-people exchanges, including by expanding 
14
the Fulbright Scholars Program, the International 
15
Visitors Leadership Program, and other exchange 
16
programs that permit the people of Taiwan to work 
17
and study in the United States.
