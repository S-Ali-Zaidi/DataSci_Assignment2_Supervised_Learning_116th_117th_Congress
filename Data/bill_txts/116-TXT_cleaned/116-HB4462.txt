expanding upon and improving spectrum sharing tech-
12
niques developed for use in the 3.5 gigahertz band and 
13
that includes the following considerations: 
14
(1) How to promote an ecosystem of devices 
15
employing such sharing techniques. 
16
(2) How to ensure that any Federal protection 
17
zones and corresponding technical rules and power 
18
levels are no more protective than necessary. 
19
(3) The applicability of such sharing techniques 
20
to frequencies between 3100 megahertz and 3550 
21
megahertz, inclusive, and frequencies between 7125 
22
megahertz and 8400 megahertz, inclusive, to the ex-
23
tent any portion of such frequencies cannot be
