(1) continued inaction in addressing climate 
16
change poses a significant and increasing threat to 
17
the growth and stability of the economy of the 
18
United States;

20
States and many American businesses are exposed 
21
to multiple channels of climate-related risk, which 
22
may include exposure to— 
23
(A) the physical impacts of climate change, 
24
including the rise of the average global tem-

perature, accelerating sea-level rise, desertifica-
1
tion, ocean acidification, intensification of 
2
storms, increase in heavy precipitation, more 
3
frequent and intense temperature extremes, 
4
more severe droughts, and longer wildfire sea-
5
sons; 
6
(B) the economic disruptions and security 
7
threats that result from the physical impacts 
8
described in subparagraph (A); and 
9
(C) the transition impacts that result as 
10
the global economy transitions to a clean and 
11
renewable energy, low-emissions economy, in-
12
cluding financial impacts as fossil fuel assets 
13
risk becoming stranded and it becomes uneco-
14
nomic for companies to develop fossil fuel assets 
15
as policymakers act to limit the worst impacts 
16
of climate change by keeping the average rise in 
17
global temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius above 
18
pre-industrial levels; 
19
(3) assessing the potential impact of climate-re-
20
lated risks on national and international financial 
21
systems is an urgent concern; 
22
(4) companies have a duty to disclose financial 
23
risks that climate change presents to their investors, 
24
lenders, and insurers;

(5) the Commission has a duty to promote a 
1
risk-informed securities market that is worthy of the 
2
trust of the public as families invest for their fu-
3
tures; 
4
(6) investors, lenders, and insurers are increas-
5
ingly demanding climate risk information that is 
6
consistent, comparable, reliable, and clear; 
7
(7) including standardized, material climate 
8
change risk and opportunity disclosure that is useful 
9
for decision makers in annual reports to the Com-
10
mission will increase transparency with respect to 
11
risk accumulation and exposure in financial markets; 
12
(8) requiring companies to disclose climate-re-
13
lated risk exposure and risk management strategies 
14
will encourage a smoother transition to a clean and 
15
renewable energy, low-emissions economy and guide 
16
capital allocation to mitigate, and adapt to, the ef-
17
fects of climate change and limit damages associated 
18
with climate-related events and disasters; and 
19
(9) a critical component in fighting climate 
20
change is a transparent accounting of the risks that 
21
climate change presents and the implications of con-
22
tinued inaction with respect to climate change.
