SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
11
Congress finds the following: 
12
(1) Pursuant to State and Federal law, the 
13
States retain primary and policy-making authority 
14
with regard to wildlife management, and nothing in 
15
this Act interferes with or otherwise affects the pri-
16
mary authority of the States in managing wildlife 
17
generally, or managing, surveying, and monitoring 
18
the incidence of chronic wasting disease. 
19
(2) Chronic wasting disease, the fatal neuro-
20
logical disease found in cervids, is a fundamental 
21
threat to the health and vibrancy of deer, elk, and 
22
moose populations, and the increased occurrence of 
23
chronic wasting disease in regionally diverse loca-
24
tions in recent months necessitates an escalation in 
25

•HR 1550 IH
applied research, surveillance, monitoring, and man-
1
agement activities focused on containing and man-
2
aging this lethal disease. 
3
(3) As the States move to manage existing lev-
4
els of chronic wasting disease and insulate non-
5
infected wild and captive cervid populations from the 
6
disease, the Federal Government should endeavor to 
7
provide integrated and holistic financial and tech-
8
nical support to these States and the many State de-
9
partments of wildlife, State departments of agri-
10
culture, colleges and universities, and related re-
11
search centers conducting scientific applied research 
12
regarding chronic wasting disease. 
13
(4) The Secretary should provide consistent, co-
14
herent, and integrated support structures and pro-
15
grams for the benefit of State wildlife and agricul-
16
tural administrators, as chronic wasting disease can 
17
move freely between captive and wild cervids across 
18
the broad array of Federal, State, tribal, and local 
19
land management jurisdictions. 
20
(5) The Secretary can provide consistent, coher-
21
ent, and integrated support systems under existing 
22
legal authorities to States and the many State de-
23
partments of wildlife, State departments of agri-
24
culture, colleges and universities, and related re-

(a) AVAILABILITY OF ASSISTANCE.—The Secretary 
5
shall allocate funds made available under subparagraphs

9
ment strategies to address chronic wasting disease.
