A BILL 
To direct the Comptroller General of the United States to 
complete a study on barriers to participation in federally 
funded cancer clinical trials by populations that have 
been traditionally underrepresented in such trials. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Henrietta Lacks En-

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds as follows: 
2
(1) Only a small percent of patients participate 
3
in cancer clinical trials, even though most express an 
4
interest in clinical research. There are several obsta-
5
cles that restrict individuals from participating in-
6
cluding lack of available local trials, restrictive eligi-
7
bility criteria, transportation to trial sites, taking 
8
time off from work, and potentially increased med-
9
ical and nonmedical costs. Ultimately, about 1 in 5 
10
cancer clinical trials fail because of lack of patient 
11
enrollment. 
12
(2) Groups that are generally underrepresented 
13
in clinical trials include racial and ethnic minorities 
14
and older, rural, and lower-income individuals. 
15
(3) Henrietta Lacks, an African-American 
16
woman, was diagnosed with cervical cancer at the 
17
age of 31, and despite receiving painful radium 
18
treatments, passed away on October 4, 1951. 
19
(4) Medical researchers took samples of Hen-
20
rietta Lacks’ tumor during her treatment and the 
21
HeLa cell line from her tumor proved remarkably 
22
resilient. 
23
(5) HeLa cells were the first immortal line of 
24
human cells. Henrietta Lacks’ cells were unique, 
25
growing by the millions, commercialized and distrib-

uted worldwide to researchers, resulting in advances 
1
in medicine. 
2
(6) Henrietta Lacks’ prolific cells continue to 
3
grow and contribute to remarkable advances in med-
4
icine, including the development of the polio vaccine, 
5
as well as drugs for treating the effects of cancer, 
6
HIV/AIDS, hemophilia, leukemia, and Parkinson’s 
7
disease. These cells have been used in research that 
8
has contributed to our understanding of the effects 
9
of radiation and zero gravity on human cells. These 
10
immortal cells have informed research on chromo-
11
somal conditions, cancer, gene mapping, and preci-
12
sion medicine. 
13
(7) Henrietta Lacks and her immortal cells 
14
have made a significant contribution to global 
15
health, scientific research, quality of life, and patient 
16
rights. 
17
(8) For more than 20 years, the advances made 
18
possible by Henrietta Lacks’ cells were without her 
19
or her family’s consent, and the revenues they gen-
20
erated were not known to or shared with her family. 
21
(9) Henrietta Lacks and her family’s experience 
22
is fundamental to modern and future bioethics poli-
23
cies and informed consent laws that benefit patients 
24
nationwide by building patient trust; promoting eth-

traditionally underrepresented populations; and pro-

(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 2 years after the 
9
date of enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General 
10
of the United States shall— 
11
(1) complete a study that— 
12
(A) reviews what actions Federal agencies 
13
have taken to help to address barriers to par-
14
ticipation in federally funded cancer clinical 
15
trials by populations that have been tradition-
16
ally underrepresented in such trials, and identi-
17
fies challenges, if any, in implementing such ac-
18
tions; and 
19
(B) identifies additional actions that can 
20
be taken by Federal agencies to address bar-
21
riers to participation in federally funded cancer 
22
clinical trials by populations that have been tra-
23
ditionally underrepresented in such trials; and 
24

(2) submit a report to the Congress on the re-
1
sults of such study, including recommendations on 
2
potential changes in practices and policies to im-
3
prove participation in such trials by such popu-
4
lations. 
5
(b) INCLUSION OF CLINICAL TRIALS.—The study 
6
under subsection (a)(1) should include review of cancer 
7
clinical trials that are largely funded by Federal agencies, 
8
including the National Institutes of Health, the Depart-
9
ment of Defense, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the 
10
Agency for Health Research and Quality, the Food and 
11
Drug Administration, and such other Federal agencies as 
12
the Comptroller General of the United States may iden-
13
tify.
