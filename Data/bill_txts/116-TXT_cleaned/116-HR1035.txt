Whereas 41,700 DACA recipients perform critical roles in the 
health care industry;

provide medical care to approximately 4,600 patients a 
year; 
Whereas immigrants have filled approximately one-third of 
physician roles in the United States for a decade; 
Whereas the Association of American Medical Colleges at-
tested to the United States Supreme Court that our 
health care system relies on current immigrant health 
care providers; 
Whereas in response to COVID–19, immigrants are putting 
their own lives on the line to save lives every day, work-
ing as diagnosing and treating practitioners, physicians 
assistants, nurses, health aides, nursing assistants and 
orderlies, health care support workers, medical students 
and residents, and health technologists and technicians; 
Whereas nearly one-third of all DACA recipients (200,000 in-
dividuals), and more than 130,000 of the estimated 
411,000 Temporary Protected Status holders, are serving 
on the frontlines of the response to COVID–19 and are

Whereas immigrant essential workers, including first-re-

Whereas immigrants have served in the Armed Forces since 
the founding of our country, and have fought in every 
major conflict in American history, including the Civil 
War, World Wars I and II, and conflicts in Vietnam, Af-
ghanistan, and Iraq; 
Whereas immigrants have put their lives on the line to pro-
tect the ideals of America and democracy, as well as 
American lives, by serving as translators and interpreters 
for the Armed Forces, and performing sensitive and 
trusted activities for United States military personnel 
stationed at the international Security Assistance Force; 
Whereas immigrants who serve in emerging industries with 
pronounced labor shortages in America such as artificial 
intelligence that rely on science, technology, engineering, 
and math (STEM) skills, not only bolster the economy, 
but also enhance national security and global leadership; 
Whereas when immigrants have a trusting relationship with 
local law enforcement, they have reported crime and have 
worked with police on neighborhood crime reduction 
strategies; 
Whereas more immigrants reside in the United States than 
any other country in the world, and represent almost 
every country in the world, contributing to our rich diver-
sity of people, cultures, cuisine, literature, art, language, 
academia, music, media, fashion, and customs; 
Whereas the United States is more diverse than ever before 
in its history, with greater shares of immigrants from 
countries such as India, China (including those born in 
Hong Kong and Macao, but not Taiwan), the Philippines, 
El Salvador, Vietnam, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, 
South Korea, and Guatemala, and an increase of 71 per-

cent since 2000 of Black immigrants from across the Af-

lation in the United States; 
Whereas in response to recent civil unrest in the United 
States immigrants of all backgrounds have pledged their

immigrants, to fight for accountability from law enforce-
ment and the criminal justice system and to demand that 
law enforcement protect people, regardless of their skin 
color; 
Whereas celebrating racial, ethnic, linguistic, and religious 
differences of immigrants has resulted in a unified, patri-
otic, and prosperous Nation; 
Whereas immigration has long been one of America’s greatest 
competitive advantages; 
Whereas immigrants of all skill levels have helped make the 
economy of the United States the strongest in the world, 
complementing existing American businesses in times of 
need and founding successful businesses of their own;

although 
only 
accounting 
for 
13.5 
percent 
(40,000,000) of the total population of the United States, 
nearly half of Fortune 500 companies were founded by 
immigrants or their children, which has created over 
$6,000,000,000,000 in annual revenue and employs mil-
lions of Americans; 
Whereas 72.5 percent of immigrants believe that hard work 
is necessary to succeed in America and are responsible

•HRES 1035 IH 
Whereas 62.2 percent of immigrants aged 16 and older (as 
opposed to 58.1 percent of native-born Americans) were 
employed; 
Whereas immigrants are entrepreneurial, self-starters who 
create their own opportunity and employment opportuni-
ties for others with 7.6 percent of immigrants being self- 
employed compared to 5.6 percent of native-born Ameri-
cans; 
Whereas immigrant-owned businesses provide jobs across the 
United States, respectively employing an average of 11 
employees; 
Whereas immigrants are more likely to have college degrees 
than native-born Americans and are more likely to have 
advanced degrees; 
Whereas our high-skilled immigration system has not been 
updated in over 25 years, and is now outdated and over-
burdened, putting our global leadership at risk; 
Whereas national security experts agree that it is essential 
for 
the 
United 
States 
to 
maintain 
its 
military 
exceptionalism by being the leader in advanced tech-
nologies such as artificial intelligence, cyber, quantum, 
robotics, directed energy and hypersonic weapons, which 
are all STEM fields where immigrants fill dangerous 
labor shortages in the United States; 
Whereas due to population aging and longer life expectancy 
of the population in the United States requiring an in-
crease in health care workers, immigrants are expected to 
fill a crucial need in future health care of the United 
States, keeping us healthy; 
Whereas in just 20 years, meaningful immigration policy re-
form 
would

1,200,000,000,000, contributing to greater economic sta-
bility and safety; 
Whereas over the course of the next decade, immigration pol-
icy reform would result in the creation of 3,230,000 new 
jobs, keeping us more economically sound; 
Whereas if Dreamers, alone, were provided a pathway to citi-
zenship, 
they 
would 
contribute 
approximately 
$1,000,000,000,000 to the economy of the United States; 
Whereas over 70 percent of immigrants are between the ages 
of 25 and 64 compared to less than 50 percent of native- 
born Americans, and by 2035, the working age of immi-
grants will increase by 18,000,000, keeping us safer and 
prosperous; 
Whereas because immigrants in the United States are more 
likely to be working-age than their United States-born 
counterparts, they are more likely to contribute to the 
labor force and economy as both consumers and tax-
payers, thereby helping to fund social services and pro-
grams like Medicare and Social Security, keeping us 
healthier, safer, and economically prosperous; and 
Whereas continued integration of immigrants from around 
the world that encourages and facilitates a pathway to 
citizenship, economic and social mobility, and civic en-
gagement, will perpetuate America’s prosperity and en-
force the patriotism we all feel for our great Nation, no 
matter the color of skin, country of origin, or religious 
background: Now, therefore, be it
