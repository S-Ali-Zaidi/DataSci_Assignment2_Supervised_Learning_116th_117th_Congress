RESOLUTION 
Supporting the goals and ideals of Menstrual Hygiene Day. 
Whereas, since 2013, Menstrual Hygiene Day is annually 
commemorated on May 28 to raise awareness and cata-
lyze political action around the challenges menstruating 
women and girls around the world face; 
Whereas the Joint Monitoring Programme of the World 
Health Organization and UNICEF defines menstrual hy-
giene management as when ‘‘women and adolescent girls 
are using a clean menstrual management material to ab-
sorb or collect menstrual blood, that can be changed in

privacy as often as necessary for the duration of a men-
strual period, using soap and water for washing the body 
as required, and having access to safe and convenient fa-
cilities to dispose of used menstrual management mate-
rials’’; 
Whereas 500,000,000 women and girls around the world lack 
adequate facilities for menstrual health and hygiene man-
agement; 
Whereas cultural stigma and lack of access to menstrual 
health and hygiene education, sanitation, and infrastruc-
ture can limit access to schools, jobs, and religious activi-
ties; 
Whereas, around the world, 1 in 3 girls have access to inad-
equate toilets, and many others face social and cultural 
restrictions when they have their periods; 
Whereas displaced women and adolescent girls, whether by 
conflict, climate, or natural disaster, face significant bar-
riers to managing monthly menstruation in a safe, pri-
vate, and dignified manner; 
Whereas failing to provide disposal facilities for used sanitary 
pads or cloths can result in a significant solid waste 
issue, causing blockage of latrines and pits; 
Whereas 25,000,000 women in the United States live at or 
below the poverty line, often without consistent access to 
menstrual hygiene products; 
Whereas a survey of low-income women in a large United 
States city published in January 2019 found that nearly 
two-thirds couldn’t afford menstrual hygiene products 
during the previous year; 
Whereas estimates reveal that a woman may spend over 
$1,700 in her lifetime on tampons, a figure that is multi-

plied for women who also support children who are men-
struating; 
Whereas incarcerated women have illustrated that their dig-
nity has been compromised as they seek to access men-
strual hygiene products; and 
Whereas, in the United States, a school’s failure to provide 
a supportive environment for menstruating students can 
have negative consequences: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—

(1) recognizes the need to break the silence,
