RESOLUTION 
Condemning and censuring Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the 
House of Representatives. 
Whereas, on February 4, 2020, President Donald J. Trump 
delivered the State of the Union address, a traditional 
event where the President of the United States, irrespec-
tive of party, celebrates the accomplishments benefitting 
the country, and lays out a plan for additional work; 
Whereas the address is one of the rare times the House and 
Senate meet jointly with the President; 
Whereas proper decorum, and a respect for the institution of 
Congress, requires the Members in attendance to dem-

onstrate civility even to those whose opinions with whom 
they disagree; 
Whereas this has been an accepted and bipartisan practice 
for generations; 
Whereas the State of the Union speech in 2020 recognized 
great Americans, including the last surviving Tuskegee 
Airman, the miraculous survival of a child born pre-
maturely at 21 weeks, the mourning families of Rocky 
Jones and Kayla Mueller, the grandfather of political talk 
radio, historic low rates of unemployment for African 
Americans, Asian Americans and Hispanics, and the 
speech took a heartfelt moment to recognize an active 
duty soldier’s happy reunion with his family; 
Whereas instead of taking responsibility for her impetuous 
and petty outburst, she instead falsely claimed the speech 
was a ‘‘manifesto’’ and contained untruths; 
Whereas Speaker Nancy Pelosi discredited the House of Rep-
resentatives by publicly ripping up an official copy of the 
State of the Union speech in what has been described as 
a ‘‘temper tantrum’’, ‘‘classless’’, ‘‘disrespectful’’, and a 
‘‘misguided emotional outburst of hate’’; and 
Whereas Speaker Nancy Pelosi has, based on the conduct 
documented above, violated clause 1 of rule XXIII of the 
Code of Official Conduct which states that ‘‘A Member, 
Delegate, Resident Commissioner, officer or employee of 
the House shall behave at all times in a manner that 
shall reflect creditably on the House’’: Now, therefore, be 
it 
Resolved, That—
