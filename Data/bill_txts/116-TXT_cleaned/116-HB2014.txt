mental discrimination against providers of health services 
that are not involved in abortion. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Conscience Protection 
4
Act of 2019’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds as follows: 
7
(1) Thomas Jefferson stated a conviction com-
8
mon to our Nation’s founders when he declared in 
9
1809 that ‘‘[n]o provision in our Constitution ought 
10
to be dearer to man than that which protects the 
11
rights of conscience against the enterprises of the 
12
civil authority’’. 
13
(2) In 1973, the Supreme Court concluded that 
14
the government must leave the abortion decision ‘‘to 
15
the medical judgment of the pregnant woman’s at-
16
tending physician’’, recognizing that a physician may 
17
choose not to participate in abortion. Roe v. Wade, 
18
410 U.S. 113, 164 (1973). The Court cited with ap-
19
proval a policy that ‘‘neither physician, hospital, nor 
20
hospital personnel shall be required to perform any 
21
act violative of personally-held moral principles’’, 
22
410 U.S. at 143 n. 38, and cited State laws uphold-
23

ing this principle. Doe v. Bolton, 410 U.S. 179, 
1
197–8 (1973). 
2
(3) Congress’ enactments to protect this right 
3
of conscience in health care include the Church 
4
amendment of 1973 (42 U.S.C. 300a–7), the Coats/ 
5
Snowe amendment of 1996 (42 U.S.C. 238n), and 
6
the Weldon amendment approved by Congresses and 
7
Presidents of both parties every year since 2004. 
8
(4) None of these laws explicitly provides a 
9
‘‘private right of action’’ so victims of discrimination 
10
can defend their conscience rights in court, and ad-
11
ministrative enforcement by the Department of 
12
Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights 
13
has been lax, at times allowing cases to languish for 
14
years without resolution. 
15
(5) Defying the Federal Weldon amendment, 
16
California’s Department of Managed Health Care 
17
has mandated coverage for all elective abortions in 
18
all health plans under its jurisdiction. Other States 
19
such as New York and Washington have taken or 
20
considered similar action, and some States may go 
21
farther to require all physicians and hospitals to pro-
22
vide or facilitate abortions. On June 21, 2016, the 
23
Obama Administration concluded a nearly two-year 
24
investigation of this matter by determining that 
25
19:18 Apr 15, 2019
H2014
4 
•HR 2014 IH
California’s decision to require insurance plans 
1
under the California Department for Managed 
2
Health Care authority to cover all legal abortion 
3
services did not violate the Weldon amendment. 
4
Until the new Administration is able to reverse this 
5
finding, individuals will have to choose between ig-
6
noring their conscience or forgoing health care cov-
7
erage. 
8
(6) The vast majority of medical professionals 
9
do not perform abortions, with 86 percent of ob/gyns 
10
unwilling to provide them in a recent study (Obstet-
11
rics & Gynecology, Sept. 2011) and the great major-
12
ity of hospitals choosing to do so in rare cases or not 
13
at all. 
14
(7) A health care provider’s decision not to par-
15
ticipate in an abortion, like Congress’ decision not to 
16
fund most abortions, erects no new barrier to those 
17
seeking to perform or undergo abortions but leaves 
18
each party free to act as he or she wishes. 
19
(8) Such protection poses no conflict with other 
20
Federal laws, such as the law requiring emergency 
21
stabilizing treatment for a pregnant woman and her 
22
unborn child when either is in distress (Emergency 
23
Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act). As the 
24
previous Administration has said, these areas of law 
25

•HR 2014 IH
have operated side by side for many years and both 
1
should be fully enforced (76 Fed. Reg. 9968–77 
2
(2011) at 9973). 
3
(9) Reaffirming longstanding Federal policy on 
4
conscience rights and providing a right of action in 
5
cases where it is violated allows longstanding and 
6
widely supported Federal laws to work as intended.

9
