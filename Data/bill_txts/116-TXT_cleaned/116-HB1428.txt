SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Investments in infrastructure create jobs 
3
while 
fulfilling 
critical 
needs 
in 
communities 
4
throughout the United States. 
5
(2) According to the Brookings Institution, 
6
nearly 14.5 million workers—11 percent of the U.S. 
7
workforce—were employed in infrastructure jobs in 
8
2013. 
9
(3) According to data from the Brookings Insti-
10
tution, infrastructure occupations often provide more 
11
competitive and equitable wages in comparison to all 
12
jobs nationally, consistently paying up to 30 percent 
13
more to low-income workers. 
14
(4) The American Society of Civil Engineers 
15
gave the infrastructure of the United States an over-
16
all grade of ‘‘D+’’ in 2017 and estimated that the 
17
United States will need to invest $4.59 trillion by 
18
2025 in order to improve the condition of the Na-
19
tion’s infrastructure and bring it to a state of good 
20
repair. 
21
(5) The American Society of Civil Engineers as-
22
signed a ‘‘D’’ grade to the Nation’s roads, a ‘‘C+’’ 
23
grade to the Nation’s bridges, and a ‘‘D¥’’ grade 
24
to the Nation’s transit systems and estimated that 
25
the United States will need to invest $2.04 trillion

by 2025 to bring the Nation’s surface transportation 
1
infrastructure to a state of good repair. 
2
(6) BUILD is a nationwide competitive grant 
3
program that creates jobs by funding investments in 
4
transportation infrastructure by States, local govern-
5
ments, and transit agencies. 
6
(7) BUILD is formally known as the Better 
7
Utilizing Investments to Leverage Development 
8
(BUILD) Transportation Grants program and was 
9
previously known as the Transportation Investment 
10
Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) grant pro-
11
gram. 
12
(8) BUILD funds projects that will have a sig-
13
nificant impact on the Nation, a metropolitan area, 
14
or a region. 
15
(9) In distributing grants under BUILD, the 
16
Secretary of Transportation is required to ensure an 
17
equitable geographic distribution of funds, a balance 
18
in addressing the needs of urban and rural areas, 
19
and investments in a variety of modes of transpor-
20
tation. 
21
(10) TIGER or BUILD received an appropria-
22
tion of $600,000,000 in fiscal year 2014, an appro-
23
priation of $500,000,000 in fiscal year 2015, an ap-
24
propriation of $500,000,000 in fiscal year 2016, an 
25

•HR 1428 IH
appropriation of $500,000,000 in fiscal year 2017, 
1
and an appropriation of $1,500,000,000 in fiscal 
2
year 2018. 
3
(11) Past appropriations for TIGER and 
4
BUILD are not sufficient to address the need for in-
5
vestments in transportation infrastructure in com-
6
munities throughout the United States as the 
7
amounts only fund a small fraction of the transpor-
8
tation infrastructure projects for which grant appli-
9
cations have been received. 
10
(12) Appropriating $7.5 billion in fiscal year 
11
2019 for BUILD and allowing the funds to remain 
12
available for 6 years will enable the Secretary of 
13
Transportation to begin immediately to expand in-
14
vestments in transportation infrastucture throughout 
15
the United States. 
16
(13) Restricting appropriations for BUILD 
17
through the use of arbitrary budget caps or seques-
18
tration undermines economic recovery and job cre-
19
ation efforts; disrupts planning by States, local gov-
20
ernments, and transit agencies; and leaves critical 
21
infrastructure needs unmet. 
22
(14) Emergency supplemental appropriations 
23
for BUILD, provided in addition to other appropria-
24
tions and not subject to sequestration, will improve 
25

transportation 
infrastructure 
and 
create 
jobs 
1
throughout the United States without reducing 
2
funding for other domestic priorities. 
3
(15) An emergency supplemental appropriation 
4
of $7.5 billion for BUILD to be made available in 
5
fiscal year 2019 and to remain available for 6 years 
6
will allow the Secretary of Transportation to begin 
7
immediately to organize new competitions for 
8
BUILD grants and allow States, local governments, 
9
and transit agencies to prepare grant applications, 
10
thus ensuring an efficient use of funds and timely 
11
job creation.
