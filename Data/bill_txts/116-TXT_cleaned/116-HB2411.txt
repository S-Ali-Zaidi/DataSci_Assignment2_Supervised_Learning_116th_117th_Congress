A BILL 
To prohibit the sale of tobacco products to individuals under 
the age of 21. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Tobacco to 21 Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
5
Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) Tobacco use has caused more than 
7
20,800,000 premature deaths in the United States 
8

since the Surgeon General’s first report on smoking 
1
in 1964. 
2
(2) The 1964 Surgeon General’s report linked 
3
cigarette smoking to cancer, and since then, other 
4
tobacco products, including cigars, cigarillos, roll- 
5
your-own products, and smokeless tobacco have been 
6
causally linked to cancer. 
7
(3) While substantial gains have been made 
8
since 1964, tobacco use remains the leading prevent-
9
able cause of death in the United States, responsible 
10
for more than 480,000 premature deaths each year. 
11
(4) Tobacco use costs the United States ap-
12
proximately $175,000,000,000 in direct medical 
13
costs and $156,000,000,000 in lost productivity 
14
every year. 
15
(5) More than 34,000,000 people in the United 
16
States still smoke, and the tobacco industry con-
17
tinues to challenge tobacco control measures in 
18
court, manipulate products to evade existing regula-
19
tions, introduce new and dangerous tobacco prod-
20
ucts, and spend billions of dollars on marketing to 
21
deceive the public and addict more children. 
22
(6) An estimated 5,600,000 youth aged 17 and 
23
under are projected to die prematurely from a to-
24

bacco-related illness if prevalence rates do not 
1
change. 
2
(7) Each day in the United States, more than 
3
2,000 youth under 18 years of age smoke their first 
4
cigarette. 
5
(8) Use of tobacco products in any form is not 
6
safe, especially during adolescence, as such use can 
7
lead to nicotine dependence and subsequent tobacco- 
8
related diseases and death. 
9
(9) Adolescents are especially vulnerable to the 
10
effects of nicotine and nicotine addiction and appear 
11
to show signs of nicotine addiction at lower levels of 
12
exposure compared to adults. 
13
(10) Nicotine exposure during adolescence may 
14
have lasting adverse consequences on brain develop-
15
ment. According to the Surgeon General, the use of 
16
products containing nicotine in any form among 
17
youth, including in electronic cigarettes, is unsafe. 
18
(11) The likelihood of developing smoking-re-
19
lated cancers increases with duration of smoking. 
20
Therefore, smokers that start at younger ages and 
21
continue to smoke are at higher risk for tobacco-re-
22
lated disease and death. 
23
(12) National data show that about 94 percent 
24
of adult smokers begin smoking before they turn 21. 
25

•HR 2411 IH
The ages of 18 to 21 are a critical period when 
1
many smokers move from experimental smoking to 
2
regular, daily use. 
3
(13) Three-quarters of adults in the United 
4
States favor raising the tobacco age of sale to 21 
5
years, including 7 in 10 smokers. 
6
(14) In 2018, the Surgeon General issued an 
7
advisory on the electronic cigarette epidemic among 
8
youth. Electronic cigarette use among high school 
9
students in the United States increased 78 percent 
10
from 2017 to 2018. In 2018, more than 3,600,000 
11
youth, including 1 in 5 high school students and 1 
12
in 20 middle school students used electronic ciga-
13
rettes. 
14
(15) Electronic cigarettes are the most com-
15
monly used tobacco product among youth. According 
16
to the Surgeon General’s 2016 report on electronic 
17
cigarettes, electronic cigarette use is strongly associ-
18
ated with the use of other tobacco products among 
19
youth and young adults. 
20
(16) The 2015 report of the National Academy 
21
of Medicine entitled, ‘‘Public Health Implications of 
22
Raising the Minimum Age of Legal Access to To-
23
bacco Products’’, concluded that raising the min-
24
imum legal age of sale of tobacco products nation-
25

•HR 2411 IH
wide will reduce tobacco initiation, particularly 
1
among adolescents aged 15 to 17, and will improve 
2
health across the lifespan and save lives. Specifically, 
3
the report said that raising the minimum legal age 
4
of sale of tobacco products nationwide to age 21 
5
would, over time, lead to a 12-percent decrease in 
6
smoking prevalence. 
7
(17) The National Academy of Medicine report 
8
also predicts that raising the minimum legal age of 
9
sale of tobacco products nationwide to age 21 would 
10
result in 223,000 fewer premature deaths, 45,000 
11
fewer deaths from lung cancer, and 4,200,000 fewer 
12
years of life lost for those born between 2000 and 
13
2019. In addition, the report concluded that raising 
14
the minimum legal age of sale would result in near 
15
immediate reductions in preterm birth, low birth 
16
weight, and sudden infant death syndrome. 
17
(18) Regulating the retail environment, actively 
18
enforcing laws, and educating retailers are strategies 
19
that Federal, State, and local governments can take 
20
to restrict the availability of tobacco products to 
21
youth.

23
and more than 110 localities in an additional 15
