RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the national debt as a threat to national 
security. 
Whereas, in February 2019, the total public debt outstanding 
was more than $22,000,000,000,000, resulting in a total

cal year 2019;

Whereas, on December 21, 2018, the total public debt as a 
percentage of gross domestic product was 104 percent; 
Whereas the last balanced Federal budget was signed into 
law in 1997; 
Whereas, in fiscal year 2018, Federal tax receipts totaled 
$3,329,000,000,000, 
but 
Federal 
outlays 
totaled 
$4,108,000,000,000, leaving the Federal Government 
with a 1-year deficit of $779,000,000,000; 
Whereas, every year since the last balanced Federal budget 
was signed in 1997, Congress has failed to maintain a 
fiscally responsible budget and has typically relied on 
raising the debt ceiling; 
Whereas the House of Representatives failed to pass a bal-
anced budget for fiscal year 2019 and failed to restore 
regular order to the legislative process by not allowing 
Representatives to offer and debate amendments; 
Whereas regular order permits the House of Representatives 
to separately debate and adopt all appropriations bills in 
a timely fashion and facilitates congressional oversight of 
Federal spending; 
Whereas the Social Security and Medicare Boards of Trust-
ees project that the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust 
Fund will be depleted in 2026; 
Whereas the Social Security and Medicare Boards of Trust-
ees project that the Federal Old-Age and Survivors In-
surance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance 
Trust Fund will be depleted in 2034; 
Whereas the credit rating of the United States was reduced 
by Standard and Poor’s from AAA to AA+ on August 
5, 2011, and has remained at that level since that date;

Whereas, without a targeted effort to balance the Federal 
budget, the credit rating of the United States is certain 
to continue to fall; 
Whereas the National Security Strategy issued by President 
Donald Trump highlights the need to reduce the national 
debt through fiscal responsibility; 
Whereas, on April 12, 2018, former Secretary of Defense 
James Mattis warned that ‘‘any Nation that can’t keep 
its fiscal house in order eventually cannot maintain its 
military power’’; 
Whereas, on March 6, 2018, Director of National Intelligence 
Dan Coats warned: ‘‘Our continued plunge into debt is 
unsustainable and represents a dire future threat to our 
economy and to our national security’’; 
Whereas, on November 15, 2017, former Secretaries of De-
fense Leon Panetta, Ash Carter, and Chuck Hagel 
warned: ‘‘Increase in the debt will, in the absence of a 
comprehensive budget that addresses both entitlements 
and revenues, force even deeper reductions in our na-
tional security capabilities’’; and 
Whereas, on September 22, 2011, former Chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff Michael Mullen warned: ‘‘I believe 
the single, biggest threat to our national security is 
debt’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) recognizes that the national debt is a threat 
2
to the national security of the United States; 
3
(2) realizes that deficits are unsustainable, irre-
4
sponsible, and dangerous;

by the United States.
