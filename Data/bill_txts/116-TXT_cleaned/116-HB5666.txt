1
Congress makes the following findings: 
2
(1) NASA should remain a multimission agency 
3
and continue to carry out, in partnership with aca-
4
demia, industry, and international partners, a bal-
5
anced program of science, aeronautics, space tech-
6
nology, human exploration, and educational activi-
7
ties. 
8
(2) The Nation’s investments in civil space re-
9
search, technology, and development have and will 
10
continue to contribute significantly to the Nation’s 
11
innovation capacity and economic strength, and pro-
12

•HR 5666 IH
vide applications and benefits that improve the lives 
1
of United States citizens and society. 
2
(3) International cooperation and collaboration 
3
strengthen the Nation’s science, aeronautics, and 
4
human exploration programs and unify partner na-
5
tions in the peaceful uses of outer space. 
6
(4) NASA’s leadership in aeronautics has con-
7
tributed greatly to the Nation’s strength in civil and 
8
commercial aviation and should remain a priority as 
9
innovative technologies and aviation concepts offer 
10
the potential to transform the future of aviation and 
11
support the Nation’s economic growth. 
12
(5) NASA makes essential contributions to our 
13
understanding of the global challenge of climate 
14
change through its collection of space-based Earth 
15
science data, research on global, integrated Earth 
16
system science, and development of models that ad-
17
vance our understanding of the climate system and 
18
the natural and human impacts on it. 
19
(6) The Nation’s human space exploration goal 
20
should be to send humans to the surface of Mars. 
21
(7) Reducing the risk and demonstrating the 
22
capabilities and operations needed to support a 
23
human mission to Mars may require human explo-
24
ration of the cis-lunar vicinity and lunar surface. 
25
22:16 Jan 25, 2020
H5666
6 
•HR 5666 IH
(8) A constancy of purpose, including clear and 
1
consistent goals and objectives, is essential for mak-
2
ing effective progress on the Nation’s science, aero-
3
nautics, space technology, and human exploration 
4
programs and for attracting and keeping the Na-
5
tion’s best, brightest, and most capable workforce. 
6
(9) Clearly defined roles, responsibilities, and 
7
accountability provides transparency in the imple-
8
mentation of the Nation’s civil space goals and ob-
9
jectives. 
10
(10) The innovative capabilities of the commer-
11
cial space industry are essential to the Nation’s 
12
science, aeronautics, and human space exploration 
13
activities, are an important instrument of techno-
14
logical and economic competitiveness, and should be 
15
leveraged, as appropriate, to advance the Nation’s 
16
objectives in civil space.

data for applied uses, including on natural resource man-
12
agement, agriculture, forestry, food security, air quality

growth and to supporting the health and safety of Ameri-
18
cans and citizens of the world.

be to pursue a program of Earth observations, research, 
24
and applications activities to better understand the Earth,

how it supports life, and how human activities affect its

ability to do so in the future. In pursuit of this goal, the

Administration’s Earth Science program shall ensure that 
3
securing practical benefits for society will be an important 
4
measure of its success in addition to securing new knowl-
5
edge about the Earth system and climate change. In fur-
6
ther pursuit of this goal, the Administration shall, to-
7
gether with other relevant agencies, provide United States 
8
leadership in developing and carrying out a cooperative 
9
international Earth observations-based research program.

3
to the extent practicable and in collaboration with other 
4
Federal Government agencies, industry, and academia, to

other Federal Government agencies is important for un-
9
derstanding the impact and value of the Nation’s invest-
10
ments in space-based Earth science observations and data.

SEC. 332. MARS SAMPLE RETURN STRATEGY AND PLAN. 
13
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
14
gress that the 2011 National Academies decadal survey, 
15
‘‘Vision and Voyages for Planetary Science in the Decade 
16
2013-2022’’ states that ‘‘The Mars community . . . was 
17
emphatic in their view that a sample return mission is the 
18
next step in Mars exploration. Mars science has reached 
19
a level of sophistication such that fundamental advances 
20
in addressing the important questions . . . will come only 
21
from analysis of returned samples.’’. It is the further sense 
22
of Congress that the decadal survey recommended a Mars 
23
sample return mission as the highest priority large mis-
24
sion, and that in addition to advancing high priority

tify— 
8
(1) technologies required to carry out a sample 
9
return mission, including requirements for sample 
10
containment and handling in space and upon return 
11
to Earth;

needed to effectively manage planetary protection;

9
It is the sense of Congress that: 
10
(1) Space nuclear technology development, in-
11
cluding nuclear propulsion and surface power reac-
12
tors, is critical for enabling Moon and Mars mis-
13
sions. Nuclear propulsion technologies can reduce 
14
transit times to Mars, particularly making possible 
15
opposition class missions. Surface power would en-
16
able robotic and human exploration. It is important 
17
that the United States lead in developing the safe 
18
and sustainable use of space nuclear power. 
19
(2) NASA should continue to develop tech-
20
nologies that rely on low enriched uranium fuel and 
21
continue partnerships on such concepts with the 
22
commercial sector. Where feasible, the use of low en-
23

portunities and challenges that can transform scientific in-
1
vestigations in space and support deep space human explo-

4
tems are lighter, more compact and use less power than

the potential to offer significant benefits to the private sec-

the Nation’s goal of sending humans to Mars, especially 
14
for use in emplacing the cargo and infrastructure nec-
15
essary to support human activities at Mars. It is the fur-
16
ther sense of Congress that additional testing capabilities 
17
may be needed to support research and development on

19
government, industry, and university work on maturing
