Whereas during the past two decades, the United States Air 
Force fighter inventory was cut in half and most current 
Air Force fighter aircraft are more than 25 years old; 
Whereas the allies of the United States need to recapitalize 
their aging fighter fleets with new and more capable air-
craft; 
Whereas maintaining air superiority is essential to preserving 
global security and stability; 
Whereas the F–35 program will support the United States 
Air Force, United States Navy, and United States Ma-
rine Corps; 
Whereas through global partnerships, the F–35 Lightning II 
offers unprecedented capability and supportability across 
the spectrum of military operations; 
Whereas the F–35 Lightning II is better than any other 
fighter aircraft for air-to-ground strike missions; 
Whereas the F–35 Lightning II is a 5th Generation fighter, 
combining advanced stealth with fighter speed and agil-
ity, fully fused sensor information, network-enabled oper-
ations and advanced sustainment; 
Whereas the Department of Defense has announced that the 
price of the conventional version of the F–35 has dropped 
more than 60 percent and will drop more than another 
5 percent in the next lot; 
Whereas the most recent national security strategy empha-
sizes building a more lethal and survivable force and 
strengthening alliances; 
Whereas Luke Air Force Base, Arizona, Eglin Air Force 
Base, Florida, and Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort, 
South Carolina, are succeeding in their missions to build

the future of airpower and leading the Armed Forces in 
developing airmen and training fighter pilots; 
Whereas Luke Air Force Base, Eglin Air Force Base, and 
Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort, play significant roles 
in the F–35 program and provide invaluable training 
grounds for military pilots and pilots of allies of the 
United States to learn how to operate and maintain the 
stealth fighter jet; 
Whereas the F–35B squadron at Marine Corps Air Station 
Beaufort is the only location in the world where pilots 
train to fly the F–35B; 
Whereas the F–35 is currently flying in operational combat 
squadrons at Hill Air Force Base, Utah, Marine Corps 
Air Station Yuma, Arizona, Naval Air Station Lemoore, 
California, and in overseas locations and will soon be fly-
ing at Eilson Air Force Base, Arkansas, Burlington Air 
National Guard Base, Vermont, Truax Air National 
Guard Base, Wisconsin, Dannely Air National Guard 
Base, Alabama, and Naval Air Station Joint Reserve 
Base Fort Worth, Texas; and 
Whereas Luke Air Force Base has welcomed and trained pi-
lots and maintainers from countries such as Australia, 
Italy, Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Israel, South 
Korea, and Japan: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) finds that the continued support for the F–

35 Joint Strike Fighter Program is imperative to

national security; and
