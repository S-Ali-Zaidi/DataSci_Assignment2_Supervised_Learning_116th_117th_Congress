SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Eating disorders affect 30 million Ameri-
3
cans during their lifetime and have the highest mor-
4
tality rate of any psychiatric illness. 
5
(2) Eating disorders affect people of all body 
6
sizes, ages, races, sexual orientations, ethnicities, 
7
and socioeconomic statuses. 
8
(3) Eating disorders are complex, biologically 
9
based serious mental illnesses that include the spe-
10
cific disorders of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, 
11
binge eating disorder, avoidant-restrictive food in-
12
take disorder, and other specified feeding or eating 
13
disorders. 
14
(4) Eighty percent of people with an eating dis-
15
order are normal or higher weight, and 81 percent 
16
of people with binge eating disorder are clinically 
17
higher weight or have obesity. 
18
(5) One in 4 people seeking obesity treatment 
19
has an underlying eating disorder that is often 
20
undiagnosed. 
21
(6) Children in higher weight bodies are more 
22
likely to engage in unhealthy weight-control meas-
23
ures, and 2⁄3 are at risk of an eating disorder. 
24
(7) Research shows that focusing on weight 
25
talk, weight stigma, and dieting does not result in

long-term reduction in weight; 2⁄3 of dieters will re-
1
gain more weight than lost from dieting. 
2
(8) Studies show that shifting prevention fo-
3
cuses from weight and dieting towards long-term 
4
health practices, including a focus on body positivity, 
5
nutrition, decreasing weight-based bullying or har-
6
assment, and physical activity, without a focus on 
7
weight, BMI testing, or negative weight talk, re-
8
duces risk factors for populations affected by eating 
9
disorders and populations affected by obesity.
