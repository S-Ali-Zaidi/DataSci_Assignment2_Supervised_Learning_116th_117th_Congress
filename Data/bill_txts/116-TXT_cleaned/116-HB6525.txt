ods of isolation have sufficiently reduced coronavirus in-
fection and transmission rates, and with adequate testing 
and other safeguards to ensure infection rates do not 
exceed medical resources, and virus transmission rates 
are maintained below 1 and thereby steadily reduce the 
number of infected, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; DEFINITIONS; FINDINGS. 
3
(a) SHORT TITLE.—This Act may be cited as the 
4
‘‘Reopen America Act of 2020’’. 
5
(b) DEFINITIONS.—In this Act: 
6
(1) The term ‘‘coronavirus’’ means SARS– 
7
CoV–2. 
8
(2) The term ‘‘Governor’’ means the chief exec-
9
utive officer of a State. 
10
(3) The term ‘‘reopening plan’’ means a 
11
coronavirus State economy reopening plan under 
12
section 2.

19
(c) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds the following: 
20
02:09 Apr 22, 2020
H6525

•HR 6525 IH
(1) The majority of States have imposed forms 
1
of extreme social isolation, including strict limita-
2
tions on businesses and social behaviors, to reduce 
3
coronavirus transmission rates and avoid cata-
4
strophic harms to health from infections. 
5
(2) Despite the necessity of such economic and 
6
social restrictions, it is critically important to the 
7
economy of the United States to progressively loosen 
8
these restrictions and to reopen economic and social 
9
activity as soon and by as much as possible, but this 
10
reopening must occur under conditions that ensure 
11
infection transmission rates do not rise again, and 
12
that infections do not overwhelm health services, 
13
cause unnecessary deaths and illnesses, or neces-
14
sitate successive new rounds of social isolation. 
15
(3) Planning and implementation of State safe-
16
guards will be critical to the achievement of success-
17
ful economic and social reopening. 
18
(4) Large increases in test kits, machines, and 
19
testing supplies and of protective gear and supplies 
20
designed to limit disease transmission, are essential 
21
to the implementation of reopening plans that do not 
22
lead to unacceptable increases in transmission rates 
23
and maximize the level and rate of economic reopen-
24
ing. 
25
02:09 Apr 22, 2020
H6525

•HR 6525 IH
(5) Once effective treatments become proven, 
1
quickly scaling up their production is also necessary 
2
to save lives and to increase the capacity of the 
3
country to remain open. 
4
(6) Because of market uncertainties and the 
5
limited time for production, the necessary level of 
6
production will not occur without aggressive govern-
7
ment purchasing and market guaranties and 
8
prioritization of necessary resources. 
9
(7) It is in the public interest for the Federal 
10
Government to assume the added costs of State re-
11
opening plans and to support such plans with nec-
12
essary technical support and coordinated procure-
13
ment and distribution of necessary supplies. 
14
(8) Because extensive testing for coronavirus 
15
protection will be a critical component of reopening 
16
strategies, it is necessary for the Federal Govern-
17
ment to advance understanding of the capacities and 
18
potential uses of different, and rapidly emerging, 
19
tests.

TESTING AND CONTRIBUTION TO REOPEN-
5
ING PLANS. 
6
(a) IN GENERAL.—The Director of the Biomedical 
7
Advanced Research and Development Authority (in this 
8
section referred to as the ‘‘Director’’), in coordination with 
9
the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
10
vention, shall carry out an emergency program to evaluate 
11
on an expedited basis both the reliability of different tests 
12
and forms of testing and the capacity of those tests to 
13
contribute to reopening plans. 
14
(b) PROGRAM COMPONENTS.—This program under 
15
this section shall recognize the different practicalities to 
16
scale up different forms of tests, including self-adminis-
17
tered and professionally administered tests, and shall in-
18
clude the following: 
19
(1) 
EVALUATION
OF
SELF-ADMINISTERED 
20
TESTS.—The Director shall institute, on an expe-
21
dited basis, an evaluation of those promising self-ad-
22
ministered test products that have the capacity to 
23
provide cost-effective, high volume human testing of 
24
either presence of active virus or proof of prior infec-
25

tion and likely immunity or resistance to reinfection. 
1
The Director shall establish a network of hospitals 
2
and research institutions capable of carrying out 
3
these analyses, and shall quickly develop protocols 
4
for such testing with a goal of providing useful in-
5
formation within one week and more complete infor-
6
mation in two weeks. 
7
(2) EVALUATION OF PROFESSIONALLY ADMIN-
8
ISTERED TESTS.—The Director shall review infor-
9
mation regarding different tests that have been de-
10
veloped that require independent technical personnel 
11
and shall conduct such independent evaluations as 
12
the Director determines will be helpful to determine 
13
those mechanisms that have the greatest potential to 
14
contribute to reopening plans. 
15
(3) EVALUATION OF POPULATION-LEVEL TEST-
16
ING.—The Director shall evaluate the potential and 
17
feasibility of population-level testing for contributing 
18
to State reopening plans. For purposes of this para-
19
graph, the term ‘‘population-level testing’’ means 
20
testing of significant parts of the population that 
21
might be accomplished other than at points of med-
22
ical care, and may include testing of the entire or 
23
portions of the population, random testing, rota-
24
tional testing, mobile testing programs, and testing 
25
02:09 Apr 22, 2020

•HR 6525 IH
of categories of individuals at high risk of becoming 
1
infected or passing on infections. 
2
(4) POTENTIAL SCALE-UP.—The Director shall 
3
consult with the industry and shall determine the 
4
maximum technical and economic capacity and 
5
shortest times that would be possible to scale up 
6
production and supplies of different methods of test-
7
ing. 
8
(5) DETERMINATION OF INFECTION RATES.— 
9
The Director shall implement an emergency sero-
10
logic testing program in at least two distinct geo-
11
graphic areas of high infection rates to help deter-
12
mine levels of infection relative to levels of those 
13
with symptoms, those hospitalized, and those in need 
14
of intensive care. 
15
(6) USE OF TESTS IN REOPENING PLANS.—The 
16
Director shall evaluate the potential and logistics of 
17
different forms of testing, including mobile testing 
18
units, using different products as appropriate, to 
19
contribute to reopening plans. Possible ways of using 
20
testing to be evaluated shall include using different 
21
forms of tests as a way to filter those available for 
22
employment or eligible to engage on other social ac-
23
tivities, use of tests for contact tracing and quar-
24
antine, use of tests for particular categories of high-

contact employment, and use of population-level test-
1
ing. Based on these analyses and the best available 
2
information regarding sources and levels of disease 
3
transmission, the Director shall provide as soon as 
4
possible recommendations for how different forms of 
5
testing under different requirements might be capa-
6
ble of contributing to reopening plans and shall up-
7
date these recommendations as new information be-
8
comes available.
