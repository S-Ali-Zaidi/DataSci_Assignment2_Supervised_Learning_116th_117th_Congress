CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of Congress that Hong Kong’s loss 
of judicial and political autonomy would expose individ-
uals residing in the United States to a judicial system 
subservient to the Chinese Communist Party, and that 
the United States should suspend its extradition treaty 
with Hong Kong until it can be certified that Hong 
Kong’s judicial independence has been reestablished. 
Whereas, on December 19, 1984, the United Kingdom and 
the People’s Republic of China (PRC) agreed to the Sino- 
British Joint Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong, 
a legal binding treaty registered with the United Nations, 
laying the framework guaranteeing the autonomy of 
Hong Kong;

Whereas upon the transfer of Hong Kong to the People’s Re-
public of China, the National People’s Congress, in ac-
cordance with the Joint Declaration, adopted the Basic 
Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region 
committing Beijing to maintaining a ‘‘one country, two 
systems’’ policy regarding Hong Kong and solidifying the 
autonomy of the region; 
Whereas the Basic Law provided the safeguards by which 
Hong Kong was promised a high degree of autonomy and 
preserved Hong Kong’s right to self-governance and its 
highly regarded common law legal system committed to 
protecting universal human rights and upholding com-
mercial rules and regulations; 
Whereas Congress adopted the United States-Hong Kong 
Policy Act of 1992 ensuring continued special treatment 
of Hong Kong as separate from the People’s Republic of 
China and authorized the President to suspend those pro-
tections if it were determined that Hong Kong was not 
sufficiently autonomous from the PRC; 
Whereas Hong Kong’s independent legal system and strong 
commitment to the rule of law were paramount to its suc-
cess as a global financial and banking center and estab-
lishing itself as a strong and reliable trading partner with 
the United States; 
Whereas, in the 23 years of the ‘‘one country, two systems’’ 
policy, the Chinese Communist Party has made repeated 
attempts to challenge and erode the autonomy and open 
society of Hong Kong, including suppression of free 
speech and democratic institutions;

Whereas, since June 2019, the Chinese Communist Party has 
aggressively escalated efforts to undermined and usurp 
Hong Kong’s autonomy; 
Whereas, on May 27, 2020, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo 
declared that ‘‘Hong Kong does not continue to warrant 
treatment under United States laws in the same manner 
as U.S. laws were applied to Hong Kong before July 
1997. No reasonable person can assert today that Hong 
Kong maintains a high degree of autonomy from China, 
given facts on the ground.’’; 
Whereas, on May 28, 2020, the National People’s Congress 
approved a new national security law that would unravel 
the autonomy of Hong Kong and bypass the region’s 
independent legislature; 
Whereas, on June 30, 2020, the Chinese Communist Party, 
in violation of international agreements, finalized and en-
acted sweeping new powers over Hong Kong, ending its 
long-held political and economic autonomy and destroying 
the firewall between the two legal systems; 
Whereas, on July 3, 2020, Canada suspended its extradition 
agreement with Hong Kong; 
Whereas, on July 9, 2020, Australia suspended its extra-
dition agreement with Hong Kong; and 
Whereas, on July 20, 2020, the United Kingdom suspended 
its extradition agreement with Hong Kong: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate

(1) the Hong Kong’s loss of judicial and polit-

ical autonomy would expose individuals residing in
