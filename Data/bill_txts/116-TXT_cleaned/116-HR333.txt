2019 as Fair Housing Month, which includes bringing 
attention to the discrimination faced by everyday Ameri-
cans in the United States in housing and housing-related 
transactions on the basis of race, color, national origin, 
sex, familial status, disability, and religion. 
Whereas April 11, 2019, marks the 51st anniversary of the 
congressional passage of title VIII of the Civil Rights Act 
of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq.), commonly known as 
the ‘‘Fair Housing Act’’; 
Whereas September 13, 2019, marks the 31st anniversary of 
the congressional passage of the Fair Housing Amend-
ments Act of 1988 (Public Law 100–430; 102 Stat. 
1619); 
Whereas the Chicago Freedom Movement, led by the Rev-
erend Doctor Martin Luther King, Jr., expanded the 
fight for civil rights from the South to the North, raised 
the national consciousness about housing discrimination, 
and shaped the debate that led to the landmark fair 
housing legislation, the Fair Housing Act; 
Whereas the National Advisory Commission on Civil Dis-
orders, appointed by President Lyndon B. Johnson and 
commonly known as the ‘‘Kerner Commission’’, found on 
February 29, 1968, that ‘‘our nation is moving toward 
two societies, one black and one white—separate and un-
equal’’; 
Whereas Congress passed the Fair Housing Act as part of 
the Civil Rights Act of 1968, and President Lyndon B. 
Johnson signed the Act into law on April 11, 1968, one 
week after the assassination of the Reverend Doctor Mar-
tin Luther King, Jr.;

•HRES 333 IH 
Whereas the original Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimina-
tion in housing and housing-related transactions on the 
basis of race, color, national origin, and religion; 
Whereas the mission statement of the Department of Hous-
ing and Urban Development (HUD) reflects this commit-
ment to ‘‘build inclusive and sustainable communities free 
from discrimination’’; 
Whereas in section 808 of the Housing and Community De-
velopment Act of 1974, Congress amended the Fair 
Housing Act to include protection on the basis of sex; 
Whereas the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 passed 
by overwhelming margins in Congress, included protec-
tion on the basis of familial status and disability, created 
an important enforcement mechanism, and expanded the 
definition of ‘‘discriminatory housing practices’’ to in-
clude interference and intimidation, requiring HUD to 
issue regulations to implement and interpret the Fair 
Housing Act and report annually to Congress on the na-
ture and extent of housing discrimination; 
Whereas the intent of Congress in passing the Fair Housing 
Act was broad and inclusive, to advance equal oppor-
tunity in housing and achieve racial integration for the 
benefit of all people in the United States; 
Whereas the intent of Congress in passing the Fair Housing 
Act was to prohibit discrimination in all housing and 
housing-related transactions, including policies or prac-
tices that appear facially neutral but have a discrimina-
tory effect on protected classes; 
Whereas the Supreme Court of the United States of America 
has reaffirmed the use of the disparate impact doctrine

to challenge policies or practices that have a discrimina-
tory effect on protected classes; 
Whereas housing testing has revealed that discrimination on 
the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity exists 
and that fair housing protections must be extended to the 
lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) 
community; 
Whereas housing testing has revealed that discrimination 
against people who use public housing assistance, includ-
ing support from the Housing Choice Voucher Program 
(established under section 8(o) of the United States 
Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f(o)) and the Vet-
erans Affairs Supportive Housing Program (established 
under section 8(o)(19) of the United States Housing Act 
of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f(o)(19))), and other forms of 
legal income exists and that fair housing protections 
against source of income discrimination must be extended 
to all people; 
Whereas housing conditions impact the health, educational 
attainment level, employment opportunities, and personal 
wealth of individuals; 
Whereas borrowers of color lack access to quality and afford-
able credit compared to similarly situated White bor-
rowers; 
Whereas research shows that African-American and Latinx 
people pay anywhere between $250 million to $500 mil-
lion a year more than similarly situated White borrowers 
due to discriminatory factors in mortgage lending; 
Whereas the majority of Americans support neighborhood in-
tegration, and numerous studies have shown the uni-
versal benefits of residential integration;

•HRES 333 IH 
Whereas more than 4,000,000 violations of fair housing laws 
still occur each year against people of all protected class-
es, and testing of the enforcement of fair housing laws 
continues to uncover a high rate of discrimination in the 
rental, sales, mortgage lending, and insurance markets; 
Whereas less than 1 percent of violations of fair housing laws 
are reported each year; 
Whereas private nonprofit fair housing centers funded by the 
Fair Housing Initiatives Program (FHIP) are on the 
frontline in the effort to resolve housing discrimination 
and train local housing providers on how to comply with 
the Fair Housing Act; 
Whereas, in 2017, approximately 28,843 housing discrimina-
tion complaints were filed, of which 20,595 complaints or 
approximately 70 percent were filed with local private 
nonprofit fair housing centers; 
Whereas the Fair Housing Assistance Program (FHAP) 
funds State and local civil and human rights enforcement 
agencies to investigate and process housing discrimina-
tion complaints, conduct special enforcement projects, 
and take part in training and other projects designed to 
enhance the agency’s administration and enforcement of 
its fair housing law; 
Whereas while our Nation has made great strides in elimi-
nating housing discrimination, families with children, 
women, people with disabilities, people of color, religious 
minorities, LGBTQ people, and low-income people on 
public assistance still face discriminatory barriers to 
housing; 
Whereas fair housing education and enforcement play a piv-
otal role in increasing housing choice and home owner-

ship opportunities for people of color and combating
