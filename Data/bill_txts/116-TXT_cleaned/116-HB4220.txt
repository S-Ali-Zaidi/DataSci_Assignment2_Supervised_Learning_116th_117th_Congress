A BILL 
To amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act 
of 1965 to allow local educational agencies to use Federal 
funds for programs and activities that address chronic 
absenteeism. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Chronic Absenteeism 
4
Reduction in Every School (CARES) Act’’.

The Congress finds the following:

(1) Students who are chronically absent— 
1
meaning they miss 10 percent or more of the school 
2
year—are more likely to fall behind academically, 
3
which can lead to hardships later in life. These stu-
4
dents are 68 percent less likely than their peers to 
5
graduate. This leaves them prone to living in pov-
6
erty, suffering from diminished health, and being in-
7
volved in the criminal justice system later in life. 
8
(2) The Department of Education’s Office of 
9
Civil Rights Data Collection found that over 
10
7,000,000 students were chronically absent during 
11
the 2015–2016 school year. This makes up 14 per-
12
cent of all students. 
13
(3) Students of color are disproportionately 
14
chronically absent compared to their White peers. 
15
Latino students are 17 percent more likely to be 
16
chronically absent, African-American students are 
17
40 percent more likely, and American Indian and 
18
Pacific Islander students are over 50 percent more 
19
likely, according to the Department of Education’s 
20
Office of Civil Rights Data Collection. 
21
(4) The Department of Education has found 
22
that chronic absenteeism is widespread, stemming 
23
from a wide range of often overlapping internal and 
24
external factors. External factors include homeless-

ness, challenges within families, and transportation; 
1
while internal factors include health, fear of bullying, 
2
concern for safety, and not valuing daily school at-
3
tendance. Therefore, it is critical to have cross-sector 
4
collaborations and multifaceted strategies that incor-
5
porate parents (or guardians, as appropriate), pub-
6
lic-partner partnerships, and community partners. 
7
(5) Studies have shown that mentors can help 
8
reduce chronic absenteeism. Students who regularly 
9
meet with mentors are 52 percent less likely than 
10
their peers to skip a day of school and 37 percent 
11
less likely to skip a class. In one program, previously 
12
chronically absent students in 2012–2013 with 
13
‘‘Success Mentors’’ gained 51,562 additional days of 
14
school compared to previously chronically absent stu-
15
dents without mentors at comparison schools; and 
16
92,277 additional days compared to comparison 
17
school students without mentors during the 3-year 
18
initiative. A report on the impact of one mentoring 
19
program found that it reduced school absenteeism by 
20
half. In another study, youth showed a gain of more 
21
than a week of class attendance.
