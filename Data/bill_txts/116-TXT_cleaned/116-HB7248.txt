SEC. 1207. PILOT PROGRAM ON USE OF INNOVATIVE PRAC-
11
TICES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS. 
12
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
13
(1) The environmental review process for trans-
14
portation infrastructure projects is complex and inef-
15
ficient, resulting in delays and increased costs of de-
16
livery of needed improvements to our transportation 
17
system. 
18
(2) It is in the national interest to promote 
19
truly innovative approaches that have the potential 
20
to yield positive environmental and transportation 
21
outcomes more quickly and efficiently, with greater 
22
transparency and responsiveness to all stakeholders. 
23
(b) ESTABLISHMENT.—The Secretary of Transpor-
24
tation shall establish a pilot program to promote the use 
25

1
views for transportation projects, including innovative 
2
practices that— 
3
(1) integrate environmental planning or other 
4
techniques involving consideration of multiple re-
5
sources on a watershed or ecosystem scale; 
6
(2) enhance environmental mitigation and en-
7
hancement measures that will result in a substantial 
8
improvement over existing conditions in an eco-
9
system or watershed; 
10
(3) use innovative technologies that enable more 
11
effective public participation in decision making, in-
12
cluding use of visualization, animation, and other 
13
advanced methods for depicting alternatives; and 
14
(4) focus on environmental and transportation 
15
outcomes rather than processes. 
16
(c) FLEXIBILITIES.—In carrying out the pilot pro-
17
gram established under subsection (b), the Secretary, in 
18
concurrence with the affected agency may waive, with re-
19
spect to an eligible project, any requirement under Federal 
20
law, regulation, or order, if the Secretary and such agen-
