Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘EMS Counts Act of

(1) Emergency Medical Services (in this Act re-
1
ferred to as ‘‘EMS’’) personnel provide a critical role 
2
in emergency response. EMS consists of a diverse 
3
group of health care practitioners, such as para-
4
medics, emergency medical technicians (in this Act 
5
referred to as ‘‘EMTs’’), dual-role firefighter/EMTs, 
6
firefighter/paramedics, and volunteer personnel serv-
7
ing in each of such roles. 
8
(2) EMS is an integral component of the re-
9
sponse capacity of the United States to disasters 
10
and public health crises, such as outbreaks of infec-
11
tious diseases, bombings, mass shootings, earth-
12
quakes, tornadoes, and hurricanes. EMS personnel 
13
respond to more than 22,000,000 emergency calls 
14
each year including strokes, heart attacks, cardiac 
15
arrest, and trauma. 
16
(3) The Bureau of Labor Statistics compiles in-
17
formation on the number of individuals working in 
18
roles across the entire United States workforce. The 
19
Bureau of Labor Statistics completes this work by 
20
maintaining the Standard Occupational Classifica-
21
tion system which classifies workers and jobs into 
22
occupational categories for the purpose of collecting, 
23
calculating, analyzing, or disseminating data.

•HR 8592 IH
(4) The BLS fails to accurately count EMS 
1
practitioners because of its failure to include dual- 
2
role firefighter/EMTs and firefighter/paramedics in 
3
their count of EMS personnel. 
4
(5) Accurately counting the EMS workforce is 
5
critical for government agencies in determining the 
6
needs of EMS agencies and practitioners. These 
7
data are also crucial for informing many aspects of 
8
policy including preparedness for natural disasters, 
9
public health emergencies, and acts of terrorism.
