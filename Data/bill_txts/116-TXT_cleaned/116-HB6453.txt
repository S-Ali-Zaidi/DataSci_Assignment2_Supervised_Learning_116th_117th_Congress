by the National Instant Criminal Background Check Sys-
tem during the month of March 2019 and during the

SECTION 1. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 6453 IH
(1) COVID–19 infections have grown rapidly 
1
throughout the United States creating a widespread 
2
outbreak that has been deemed a public health emer-
3
gency by the World Health Organization. 
4
(2) The COVID–19 public health emergency 
5
has led to an increase in firearm sales, which poses 
6
a serious health and security risk to the American 
7
public. 
8
(3) A firearm may be sold before a background 
9
check is completed. 
10
(4) The increased public demand to purchase a 
11
firearm strains the resources of the National Instant 
12
Criminal Background Check System (‘‘NICS’’). 
13
(5) A person who is prohibited by Federal law 
14
from possessing a firearm, such as a person who has 
15
been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic 
16
violence, has an increased chance of acquiring a fire-
17
arm due to this increased public demand to purchase 
18
a firearm. 
19
(6) This strain on resources is affecting the 
20
ability of the NICS to complete background checks 
21
within 3-business-days, allowing for federally li-
22
censed firearm dealers to complete a firearm sale 
23
without a completed background check, which is 
24
known as a ‘‘default proceed sale’’.

(7) Such firearm sales conducted in the absence 
1
of a completed background check are known as ‘‘de-
2
fault proceeds’’ and may have devastating con-
3
sequences by making it easier for a person who is 
4
prohibited by Federal law from possessing firearms 
5
to acquire such firearms.
