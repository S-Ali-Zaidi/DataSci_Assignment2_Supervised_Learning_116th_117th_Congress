RESOLUTION 
Celebrating the 50th anniversary of the entry into force 
of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weap-
ons (NPT), recognizing the importance of the NPT’s 
continued contributions to United States and inter-
national security, and commemorating United States 
leadership in strengthening the nuclear nonproliferation 
regime since the dawn of the nuclear era. 
This resolution may be cited as the ‘‘NPT at 50 Resolution’’. 
Whereas the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons has been a 
bedrock principle of United States foreign policy since 
1945;

Whereas the United States and the former Soviet Union 
averted a catastrophic nuclear exchange during the Octo-
ber 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, which led to a series of 
bilateral and multilateral agreements to reduce the 
chances of nuclear war and prevent the spread of nuclear 
weapons; 
Whereas President John F. Kennedy predicted in 1963 that 
as many as 25 countries would acquire nuclear weapons 
by 1970 absent a treaty to control nuclear weapons; 
Whereas the nuclear nonproliferation regime, led by the 
United States, has been strengthened by a complex net-
work of complementary treaties, and agreements, the cor-
nerstone of which is the NPT; 
Whereas the NPT was signed by the United States, alongside 
the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union, on its first 
day of opening for signature, July 1, 1968; 
Whereas the United States ratified the treaty on March 13, 
1969, with a vote on ratification of 83 to 15; 
Whereas the NPT entered into force on March 5, 1970; 
Whereas the NPT provides important stability for United 
States and international security, and its success has and 
will continue to depend upon the full implementation by 
all State Parties of the treaty’s three mutually rein-
forcing pillars: nonproliferation, access to peaceful uses of 
nuclear energy, and disarmament; 
Whereas United States leadership has been and will con-
tribute to be indispensable to the development and suc-
cess of the nuclear nonproliferation regime; 
Whereas, on May 11, 1995, the NPT was extended indefi-
nitely;

•HRES 825 IH 
Whereas the NPT has grown to include 191 State Parties, 
making an irreplaceable contribution to international se-
curity by preventing the spread of nuclear weapons; 
Whereas only one nonnuclear weapon state that was a party 
to the treaty has acquired nuclear weapons; 
Whereas the United States has led the NPT’s disarmament 
pillar by negotiating bilateral arms control agreements, 
achieving dramatic reductions in the nuclear weapons 
stockpile, in support of Article VI and the disarmament 
aims of the NPT, such as 1972 SALT I, 1979 SALT II, 
1991 START I, 1993 START II, SORT, and New 
START; 
Whereas the United States has promoted the NPT’s non-
proliferation pillar by supporting states which relin-
quished their nuclear weapons and acceded to the NPT, 
such as Belarus, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and South Africa; 
Whereas the United States has also been a lead supporter of 
many regional nuclear-weapons-free zones, including 
Latin America, Central Asia, the South Pacific, Africa, 
and Southeast Asia, and bans on nuclear weapons on the 
seabed, in outer space, and on the Moon; 
Whereas the United States has worked to ensure the peaceful 
uses of nuclear energy by supporting the International 
Atomic Energy Agency and its safeguards programs, in-
cluding the Additional Protocol; 
Whereas every President has supported the NPT, such as 
when President Donald Trump noted in a message to the 
International Atomic Energy Agency’s General Con-
ference September 16, 2019, ‘‘For nearly 50 years, the 
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty has prevented the 
spread of nuclear weapons’’;

Whereas, on September 18, 2018, Assistant Secretary of 
State for International Security and Nonproliferation 
Christopher Ford recalled a President Trump statement 
in which he called the Additional Protocol ‘‘the inter-
national standard’’, and then Ford noted that ‘‘consistent 
with that message, the AP should be universalized’’; 
Whereas the United States has been a strong supporter of 
the implementing bodies of the nonproliferation and ex-
port control regimes, such as the Zangger Committee and 
the Nuclear Suppliers Group; 
Whereas the 2018 Department of Defense Nuclear Posture 
Review affirms, ‘‘The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty 
(NPT) is a cornerstone of the nuclear nonproliferation 
regime. It plays a positive role in building consensus for 
non-proliferation and enhances international efforts to 
impose costs on those that would pursue nuclear weapons 
outside the Treaty’’; 
Whereas, on June 28, 2018, the 50th anniversary of the trea-
ty first being signed, the United States, United Kingdom, 
and Russian governments released a joint statement, re-
affirming their commitment to work toward ‘‘the ultimate 
goal of the elimination of nuclear weapons, as set forth 
in the NPT’’; 
Whereas Congress has often been at the forefront of advo-
cating for nonproliferation, including through the Export- 
Import Bank Act of 1945, the McMahon Act of 1946, 
the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, the Nuclear Non-Pro-
liferation Act of 1978, the Export Administration Act of 
1979, the Nunn-Lugar Soviet Nuclear Threat Reduction 
Act of 1991, and the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention 
Act of 1994; and
