•HR 8502 IH
(1) The town of Rosewood was originally sur-
1
veyed in 1847 in Levy County, Florida, and quickly 
2
became a majority minority community. 
3
(2) On January 1, 1923, a young married 
4
White woman from a neighboring town falsely ac-
5
cused an African-American man of assault. 
6
(3) This accusation started a riot and the ma-
7
jority of Rosewood was burned to the ground. 
8
(4) This riot led to an unjust massacre and 
9
death toll that is still unknown. 
10
(5) Survivors were forced to flee to the woods 
11
and ultimately resettle around the State of Florida. 
12
(6) The town of Rosewood never recovered from 
13
this event. 
14
(7) The Governor of Florida was notified of the 
15
events, but did not intervene. 
16
(8) A small attempt was eventually made to in-
17
dict locals by a grand jury, but this was unsuccess-
18
ful. 
19
(9) This tragedy went unnoticed by those who 
20
were not immediately affected for almost 60 years, 
21
until 1982 when a reporter for the Saint Petersburg 
22
Times began to investigate the massacre. 
23
(10) In 1993, the State of Florida formally in-
24
vestigated the event and eventually passed a law

issuing compensation for the losses to the victims

5
less acts of violence.

7
must make sure to remember it.
