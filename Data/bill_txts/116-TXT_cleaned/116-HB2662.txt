•HR 2662 IH
(1) The United States is a nation of immi-
1
grants. 
2
(2) The Immigration and Nationality Act allows 
3
for immigrants to apply for asylum regardless of 
4
manner of entry. 
5
(3) All individuals seeking asylum in the United 
6
States are entitled to due process and access to an 
7
attorney. Sending asylum seekers to another country 
8
limits or may completely eliminate their opportunity 
9
to meet with counsel, thereby lowering their chances 
10
of obtaining relief. 
11
(4) The Department of Homeland Security an-
12
nounced the Migrant Protection Protocols on De-
13
cember 20, 2018, and it has already had devastating 
14
consequences given that some migrants have been 
15
returned to Mexico even though they fear staying in 
16
the country. 
17
(5) The 2018 Department of State country re-
18
port for Mexico acknowledges serious and targeted 
19
risks faced by migrants and asylum seekers in, and 
20
transiting through, Mexico, such that it remains an 
21
unsafe place for many. 
22
(6) Current immigration law is broken and 
23
Congress must work to pass humane comprehensive 
24
immigration reform.
