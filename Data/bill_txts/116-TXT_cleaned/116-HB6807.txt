A BILL 
To expand vote by mail and early voting, and to improve 
the safety, accessibility, and efficiency of in-person voting 
during elections for Federal office. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘VoteSafe Act of 2020’’. 
2
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
3
Congress finds the following: 
4
(1) The right to vote is the foundation of Amer-
5
ican democracy. Voting provides the citizenry with a 
6
vital check on their elected officials and grants peo-
7
ple the political power necessary to exercise and de-
8
fend the rights guaranteed by the United States 
9
Constitution. 
10
(2) The Elections Clause of the United States 
11
Constitution gives Congress sweeping power to regu-
12
late the time, place, and manner of Federal elections 
13
(article I, section 4 of the Constitution of the United 
14
States; see also Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council of 
15
Arizona, Inc., 570 U.S. 1 (2013)). Congress also has 
16
enforcement power under the Fourteenth and Fif-
17
teenth Amendments of the Constitution of the 
18
United States. 
19
(3) As Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., explained 
20
in a speech delivered on May 17, 1957, ‘‘So long as 
21
I do not firmly and irrevocably possess the right to 
22
vote I do not possess myself. I cannot make up my 
23
mind—it is made up for me. I cannot live as a 
24
democratic citizen, observing the laws I have helped 
25
to enact—I can only submit to the edict of others.’’. 
26

•HR 6807 IH
(4) The right to vote was not guaranteed to all 
1
Americans at our Nation’s founding. The ratification 
2
of the Fifteenth and Nineteenth Amendments, the 
3
civil rights movement’s struggle for justice and 
4
equality, and the enactment of the Voting Rights 
5
Act of 1965 and its subsequent amendments suc-
6
ceeded in expanding access to the franchise. 
7
(5) Unfortunately, the barriers faced by voters 
8
who have historically experienced the greatest obsta-
9
cles to voting are exacerbated by the coronavirus 
10
(COVID-19) pandemic. 
11
(6) Strategies to mitigate the spread of 
12
COVID-19 include ‘‘social distancing’’, a practice 
13
that requires individuals to maintain a distance be-
14
tween themselves and other people in order to avoid 
15
acquiring or transmitting the virus. The need to em-
16
brace such precautions will require States to quickly 
17
modify voting processes to minimize person-to-per-
18
son contact. 
19
(7) Voting by mail is a critical part of the solu-
20
tion and must be expanded as quickly as possible, 
21
not simply as a means of ensuring access during 
22
public health emergencies, but also as a means of ex-
23
panding access to the franchise to those whose work, 
24
health, or ability to access the ballot may be limited.

(8) However, safe and secure in-person voting 
1
remains vitally important for large groups of voters, 
2
including voters with disabilities, language minority 
3
voters, American Indian and Alaska Native voters, 
4
and African American voters. 
5
(9) The Americans with Disabilities Act of 
6
1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.) and the Rehabilita-
7
tion Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 701 et seq.) require 
8
that individuals with disabilities have equal access to 
9
every aspect of the voting process. Vote-by-mail 
10
poses various accessibility challenges for voters with 
11
disabilities, including blind, low-vision, or other 
12
print-disabled voters who may require in-person vot-
13
ing or assistive technology in order to privately and 
14
independently mark their ballots. Remedies for vot-
15
ers with disabilities require an investment of re-
16
sources to ensure State and local election websites, 
17
online voter registration portals, and vote-by-mail 
18
systems are accessible; that in-person voting loca-
19
tions permit a safe, dignified, and accessible voting 
20
experience; and that the right of voters with disabil-
21
ities to a secret ballot is not sacrificed due to the 
22
pandemic. 
23
(10) Language minority voters face unique bar-
24
riers to voting that require additional resources and 
25
16:58 Jun 01, 2020
H6807
5 
•HR 6807 IH
support to ensure full and equal access, including 
1
additional resources to ensure local compliance with 
2
the language minority voting protections in section 
3
203 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (52 U.S.C. 
4
10503) and greater language assistance services, in-
5
cluding additional bilingual or multilingual poll 
6
workers and election workers. 
7
(11) American Indian and Alaska Native voters 
8
face unique obstacles in a vote-by-mail system. Trib-
9
al communities in rural areas often do not have tra-
10
ditional residential mailing addresses and have lim-
11
ited access to transportation. Tribal members have 
12
distant rural post offices, slow mail routes, limited 
13
numbers of post office operation, and too few post 
14
office boxes. As a result, rural Tribal communities 
15
require distinct voting accommodations to ensure 
16
participation in a vote-by-mail system. 
17
(12) Finally, in-person voting holds great sig-
18
nificance for African American voters, for whom the 
19
right to vote was hard won. African Americans have 
20
been excluded from the franchise through State and 
21
local laws, poll taxes, voting literacy tests, physical 
22
violence, and lynchings. For many African American 
23
voters today, casting a ballot at one’s polling place 
24
is a solemn ritual that honors those who sacrificed 
25
16:58 Jun 01, 2020
H6807
6 
•HR 6807 IH
their safety and their lives in order to secure the 
1
right to vote. However, COVID-19 poses substantial 
2
risks to the African American population and has in-
3
fected and killed African Americans in the United 
4
States at disproportionately high rates, highlighting 
5
longstanding inequalities in resources and access to 
6
health care. 
7
(13) Social distancing designed to curb the 
8
COVID-19 pandemic will also greatly impact in-per-
9
son voter registration efforts, including voter reg-
10
istration drives and voter registration services re-
11
quired by the National Voter Registration Act. Many 
12
government offices, like State departments of motor 
13
vehicles, are currently closed to in-person traffic and 
14
are likely to remain closed for an indefinite period 
15
of time in 2020. 
16
(14) Therefore, it is appropriate for Congress 
17
to expand no-excuse absentee vote-by-mail while also 
18
ensuring the safety and accessibility of in-person 
19
voting and voter registration during exigent cir-
20
cumstances, including the current pandemic.
