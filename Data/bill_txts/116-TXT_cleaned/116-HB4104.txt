African-American players being banned from the 
1
major leagues.

(2) On February 13, 1920, Andrew ‘‘Rube’’ 
3
Foster convened a meeting of 8 independent Afri-
4
can-American baseball team owners at the Paseo 
5
YMCA in Kansas City, Missouri, to form a ‘‘league 
6
of their own,’’ establishing the Negro National 
7
League, the first successful, organized professional 
8
African-American baseball league in the United 
9
States. 
10
(3) Soon, additional leagues formed in eastern 
11
and southern States. 
12
(4) The Negro Leagues would operate for 40 
13
years until 1960. 
14
(5) The story of the Negro Leagues is a story 
15
of strong-willed athletes who forged a glorious his-
16
tory in the midst of an inglorious era of segregation 
17
in the United States. 
18
(6) The passion of the Negro Leagues players 
19
for the National Pastime would not only change the 
20
game, but also the United States. 
21
(7) The creation of the Negro Leagues provided 
22
a playing field for more than 2,600 African-Amer-
23
ican and Hispanic baseball players to showcase their 
24
world-class baseball abilities.

(8) The Negro Leagues introduced an exciting 
1
brand of baseball that was in stark contrast to 
2
Major League Baseball. 
3
(9) A fast, aggressive style of play attracted 
4
black and white fans who sat together to watch 
5
those games at a time when it was virtually unheard 
6
of to interact socially in such a way. 
7
(10) Negro Leagues baseball would become a 
8
catalyst for economic development across the United 
9
States in major urban centers such as Kansas City, 
10
St. Louis, New York, Memphis, Baltimore, Wash-
11
ington, DC, Chicago, and Atlanta. 
12
(11) The Negro Leagues pioneered ‘‘Night 
13
Baseball’’ in 1930, 5 years before Major League 
14
Baseball, and would introduce game changing inno-
15
vations such as shin guards and the batting helmet. 
16
(12) The Negro Leagues helped make the Na-
17
tional Pastime a global game as players from the 
18
Negro Leagues— 
19
(A) were the first people from the United 
20
States to play in many Spanish-speaking coun-
21
tries; and 
22
(B) introduced professional baseball to the 
23
Japanese in 1927.

(13) Jackie Robinson, a military veteran and 
1
former member of the Negro league’s Kansas City 
2
Monarchs, would break Major League Baseball’s 
3
color barrier on April 15, 1947, with the Brooklyn 
4
Dodgers, paving the way for other African-American 
5
and Hispanic baseball players. 
6
(14) The Negro Leagues were born out of seg-
7
regation yet would become a driving force for social 
8
change in the United States. 
9
(15) The Negro Leagues produced future Major 
10
League Baseball stars, including Leroy ‘‘Satchel’’ 
11
Paige, Larry Doby, Willie Mays, Henry Aaron, 
12
Ernie Banks, and Roy Campanella. 
13
(16) The Negro Leagues Baseball Museum was 
14
established in Kansas City, Missouri, in 1990— 
15
(A) to save from extinction a precious 
16
piece of Americana and baseball history; and 
17
(B) to use the many life lessons of the 
18
powerful story of triumph over adversity of 
19
Negro Leagues players to promote tolerance, di-
20
versity, and inclusion. 
21
(17) In 2006, Congress granted National Des-
22
ignation to the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum, 
23
recognizing it as ‘‘America’s Home’’ for Negro 
24
Leagues baseball history.
