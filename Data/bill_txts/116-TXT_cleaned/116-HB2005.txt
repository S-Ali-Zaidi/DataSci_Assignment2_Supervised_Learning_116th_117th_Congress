A BILL 
To amend the Employee Retirement Income Security Act 
of 1974 to provide for greater spousal protection under 
defined contribution plans, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Women’s Retirement

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 2005 IH
(1) Approximately 29 percent of households 
1
headed by individuals aged 55 through 74 have no 
2
defined benefit plan or retirement savings, according 
3
to 2016 data from the Survey of Consumer Fi-
4
nances. 
5
(2) Just over one-third of the private sector 
6
workforce does not have access to a retirement plan 
7
at the workplace, and only half of the workforce ac-
8
tually participates in a retirement plan. 
9
(3) Women’s retirement preparedness often lags 
10
significantly behind their male counterparts’, result-
11
ing in the median retirement income for women in 
12
2016 being just 58 percent of men’s retirement in-
13
come. 
14
(4) Women are 1.5 times as likely as men to 
15
live in poverty after age 65. 
16
(5) Women make up 2⁄3 of low-wage workers, 
17
even though they comprise less than half of all work-
18
ers, and low-wage workers are less likely than other 
19
workers to participate in a retirement plan at work. 
20
(6) Because of the pay gap, women working 
21
full-time, year-round typically lose $403,440 over a 
22
40-year career thereby requiring the average woman 
23
to work almost a decade longer than her male coun-
24
terpart to make up that career wage gap. 
25
18:19 Apr 08, 2019
H2005

•HR 2005 IH
(7) Due to the lower lifetime wages stemming 
1
from unequal pay and caregiving duties, the average 
2
Social Security benefit for a woman age 65 or older 
3
is $14,044 a year, while men of the same age receive 
4
$18,173 a year, on average. 
5
(8) Just 1 in 5 part-time workers who work a 
6
full year are eligible for a retirement plan, and 
7
women are almost twice as likely to work part-time 
8
as men. 
9
(9) While traditional defined benefit retirement 
10
plans have spousal protections, defined contribution 
11
retirement plans, which have become increasingly 
12
common, currently provide no similar spousal protec-
13
tions. 
14
(10) Every year, more than 1,200,000 couples 
15
get divorced in the United States. After the family 
16
home, retirement savings tends to be the largest 
17
asset to be divided in a divorce. 
18
(11) While fees and expenses associated with 
19
retirement plans have been in decline, participants 
20
have seen direct charges for processing qualified do-
21
mestic relations orders increase significantly.
