are becoming increasingly vulnerable to cyber at-
2

the COVID–19 pandemic.

give school districts the ability to reduce their risk 
17

19
tricts will enable school district residents to pursue 
20
formal education, training, and industry recognized 
21
certifications for careers in cybersecurity, which will 
22
aid in the prevention and mitigation of the effects of 
23
future attacks.
