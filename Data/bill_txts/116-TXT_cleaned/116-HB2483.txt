SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress makes the following findings: 
2
(1) The Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
3
vention estimate that from August 2017 through 
4
August 2018 more than 48,000 people in the United 
5
States died from an opioid overdose, with synthetic 
6
opioids (excluding methadone), contributing to a 
7
record 31,900 overdose deaths. While drug overdose 
8
deaths from methadone, semi-synthetic opioids, and 
9
heroin have decreased in recent months, overdose 
10
deaths from synthetic opioids have continued to in-
11
crease.

•HR 2483 IH
(2) The objective of preventing the proliferation 
1
of synthetic opioids though existing multilateral and 
2
bilateral initiatives requires additional efforts to 
3
deny illicit actors the financial means to sustain 
4
their markets and distribution networks. 
5
(3) The People’s Republic of China is the 
6
world’s largest producer of illicit fentanyl, fentanyl 
7
analogues, and their immediate precursors. From 
8
the People’s Republic of China, those substances are 
9
shipped primarily through express consignment car-
10
riers or international mail directly to the United 
11
States, or, alternatively, shipped directly to transna-
12
tional criminal organizations in Mexico, Canada, and 
13
the Caribbean. 
14
(4) In 2015, Mexican heroin accounted for 93 
15
percent of the total weight of heroin seized in the 
16
United States, transported to the United States by 
17
transnational criminal organizations that maintain 
18
territorial influence over large regions in Mexico and 
19
remain the greatest criminal drug threat to the 
20
United States. 
21
(5) The United States and the People’s Repub-
22
lic of China, Mexico, and Canada have made impor-
23
tant strides in combating the illicit flow of opioids 
24
23:51 May 08, 2019
H2483

•HR 2483 IH
through bilateral efforts of their respective law en-
1
forcement agencies. 
2
(6) Insufficient regulation of synthetic opioid 
3
production and export and insufficient law enforce-
4
ment efforts to combat opioid trafficking in the Peo-
5
ple’s Republic of China and Mexico continue to con-
6
tribute to a flood of opioids into the United States. 
7
(7) While the Department of the Treasury used 
8
the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (21 
9
U.S.C. 1901 et seq.) to sanction the first synthetic 
10
opioid trafficking entity in April 2018, precision eco-
11
nomic and financial sanctions policy tools are needed 
12
to address the flow of synthetic opioids. 
13
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
14
It is the sense of Congress that— 
15
(1) the United States should apply economic 
16
and other financial sanctions to foreign traffickers of 
17
illicit opioids to protect the national security, foreign 
18
policy, and economy of the United States; and 
19
(2) it is imperative that the People’s Republic 
20
of China follow through on the commitments it made 
21
to the United States on December 6, 2018, through 
22
the Group of Twenty—
