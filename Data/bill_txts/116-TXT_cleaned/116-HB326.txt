SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. 
1
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following find-
2
ings: 
3
(1) 
From 
1961 
to 
1971, 
approximately 
4
19,000,000 gallons of 15 different herbicides were 
5
sprayed over the southern region of Vietnam. The 
6
agents included 13,000,000 gallons of Agent Or-
7
ange, 4,500,000 gallons of Agent White, 1,000,000 
8
gallons of Agent Blue, 420,000 gallons of Agent 
9
Purple, and relatively smaller quantities of the other 
10
herbicides. Many of the herbicides, including Agents 
11
Orange, Purple, Green, Pink, Dinoxol, and Trinoxol 
12
contained the toxic contaminant dioxin (TCDD). 
13
Agent Blue contained high levels of arsenic. The 
14
aforementioned 15 herbicides, including the contami-
15
nant dioxin, are usually collectively referred to as 
16
Agent Orange. 
17
(2) Between 1968 and 1971, a total of 6,500 
18
spraying missions were carried out in an area of 
19
about 1,500,000 hectares, which represented about 
20
10 percent of South Vietnam. 
21
(3) Studies show that between 2,100,000 and 
22
4,800,000 Vietnamese and tens of thousands of 
23
Americans were exposed to Agent Orange during the 
24
spraying. Many other Vietnamese were or continue 
25
to be exposed to Agent Orange through contact with

the environment and food that was contaminated or 
1
as offspring of those exposed who now suffer from 
2
illnesses and disabilities. 
3
(4) Today, there are still dozens of environ-
4
mental hot spots that continue to contaminate the 
5
food, soil, sediment, livestock, and wildlife with 
6
Agent Orange. In fact, concentrations of TCDD as 
7
high as 1,000 mg/kg were found in soil and sedi-
8
ment samples more than 30 years after Agent Or-
9
ange was sprayed in Vietnam. 
10
(5) Agent Orange exposure continues to nega-
11
tively affect the lives of veterans of the United 
12
States Armed Forces, Vietnamese people, Viet-
13
namese-Americans, and their children. The lives of 
14
many victims are cut short and others live with dis-
15
ease, disabilities, and pain, often untreated or unrec-
16
ognized. 
17
(6) The Department of Veterans Affairs recog-
18
nizes certain illnesses and diseases, including AL 
19
amyloidosis, chronic B-cell leukemia, chloracne, dia-
20
betes mellitus type 2, Hodgkin’s disease, ischemic 
21
heart disease, multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin’s 
22
lymphoma, Parkinson’s disease, acute and sub-acute 
23
peripheral neuropathy, porphyria cutanea tarda, 
24
prostate cancer, respiratory cancers, and soft-tissue

sarcomas as associated with the spraying and use of 
1
Agent Orange by the United States Armed Forces 
2
during the Vietnam era. 
3
(7) No similar consideration has been given to 
4
affected Vietnamese or Vietnamese-Americans. 
5
(8) The Department of Veterans Affairs pro-
6
vides compensation for many severe birth defects 
7
among the children of American women veterans 
8
who served in Vietnam. The list of birth defects cov-
9
ered includes but is not limited to: Achondroplasia, 
10
cleft lip, cleft palate, congenital heart disease, con-
11
genital talipes equinovarus (clubfoot), esophageal 
12
and intestinal atresia, Hallerman-Streiff syndrome, 
13
hip dysplasia, Hirschsprung’s disease (congenital 
14
megacolon), hydrocephalus due to aqueductal ste-
15
nosis, hypospadias, imperforate anus, neural tube 
16
defects, 
Poland 
syndrome, 
pyloric 
stenosis, 
17
syndactyly (fused digits), tracheoesophageal fistula, 
18
undescended testes, and Williams syndrome. Af-
19
fected children of these women veterans receive med-
20
ical care and other benefits. 
21
(9) The only birth defect recognized for the 
22
children of male American veterans is spina bifida 
23
(but not occulta), resulting in most affected children 
24
receiving no benefits.

(10) No assistance has been given to the chil-
1
dren of male or female Vietnamese or Vietnamese- 
2
Americans connected with their exposure, or their 
3
parent’s or grandparent’s exposure. 
4
(11) The Institute of Medicine for the past sev-
5
eral years has noted that ‘‘it is considerably more 
6
plausible than previously believed that exposure to 
7
the herbicides sprayed in Vietnam might have 
8
caused paternally mediated transgenerational effects 
9
. . . attributable to the TCCD contaminant in 
10
Agent Orange.’’. In recent years, scientific studies 
11
have identified likely epigenetic links between expo-
12
sure to toxins and birth defects and developmental 
13
disorders in subsequent generations. Some of the 
14
children and grandchildren of exposed persons 
15
(Americans, Vietnamese, and Vietnamese-Ameri-
16
cans) who were in southern Vietnam during the 
17
Vietnam era likely suffer from disorders, birth de-
18
fects, and illnesses related to Agent Orange. 
19
(12) Dating back to 2007, the United States 
20
has engaged in environmental remediation of con-
21
tamination at the Da Nang and Bien Hoa airports, 
22
and provided funds for public health and disabilities 
23
activities for individuals residing in some affected 
24
areas.
