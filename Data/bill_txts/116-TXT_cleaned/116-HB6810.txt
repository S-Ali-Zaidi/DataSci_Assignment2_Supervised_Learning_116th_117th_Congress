SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Health Care Protection 
2
Act’’. 
3
SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
4
It is the sense of Congress that— 
5
(1) the COVID–19 pandemic has caused many 
6
individuals to lose access to employer-sponsored 
7
health insurance at no fault of their own; 
8
(2) individuals should not be forced to cover ad-
9
ditional costs associated with healthcare due to a 
10
loss of access to employer-sponsored health insur-
11
ance; 
12
(3) employers should utilize all tools provided to 
13
them by the Federal Government to bring individ-
14
uals back onto payroll so that they may receive bene-
15
fits such as employer-sponsored health insurance; 
16
and 
17
(4) individuals unable to rejoin the workforce 
18
should receive assistance equal to that received while 
19
employed so that when an employer makes an offer 
20
of employment, the individual does not have an in-
21
centive to reject.
