SEC. 101. GOALS. 
2
(a) UNITED STATES AGRICULTURE GOAL.—As part 
3
of a national greenhouse gas emission reduction effort to 
4
prevent climate change from exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius 
5
of warming above preindustrial levels, the goal for the ag-
6
ricultural sector in the United States shall be to achieve 
7
at least a 50 percent reduction in net greenhouse gases 
8
from 2010 levels by not later than 2030 and to achieve 
9
net zero emissions by not later than 2040. 
10
(b) SUBGOALS.— 
11
(1) RESEARCH.—To help achieve the goal speci-
12
fied in subsection (a), the total Federal investment 
13
in public food and agriculture research and exten-
14
sion should, at a minimum, triple by not later than 
15

16
heightened emphasis on climate change adaptation 
17

5
(2) SOIL HEALTH.—To help achieve the goal 
6

9
forum and consortium, hosted by the Consult-
10
ative Group for International Agricultural Re-
11
search (commonly referred to as the ‘‘CGIAR’’), 
12
with the aim of increasing total soil carbon 
13
stocks by 0.4 percent annually to reduce carbon 
14
in the atmosphere, restore soil health and pro-
15
ductivity, and thereby improve food security; 
16
(B) the agricultural sector should expand 
17
adoption of soil health practices (including di-
18
verse crop rotations, cover cropping, conserva-
19
tion tillage, perennialization of highly erodible 
20
land,
