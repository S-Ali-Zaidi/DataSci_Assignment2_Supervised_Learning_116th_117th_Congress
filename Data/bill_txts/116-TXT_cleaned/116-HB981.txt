‘‘SEC. 1441. FINDINGS.

‘‘The Congress finds the following: 
9
‘‘(1) Nationally, only 70 percent of students 
10
graduate from high school with a regular high school 
11
diploma. 
12
‘‘(2) Every school day, 7,000 American high 
13
school students become dropouts. 
14
‘‘(3) High school students living in low-income 
15
families drop out of school at three times the rate 
16
of their peers from high-income families. 
17
‘‘(4) Only about 55 percent of African Amer-
18
ican students and 52 percent of Hispanic students 
19
graduate on time from high school with a regular di-
20
ploma, compared to 78 percent of white students. 
21
‘‘(5) The dropout rate for students with disabil-
22
ities is approximately twice that of general education 
23
students. 
24
‘‘(6) High school is the final transition into

1
pathways. As our next generation of leaders, our 
2
youth, are deciding their futures, they are faced with 
3
many challenges, including peer pressure and bul-
4
lying, high-stakes testing, the challenges of college 
5
admissions, the scholarship and financial aid appli-
6
cation process, and entrance into an ever more com-
7
petitive job market. Students need guidance and 
8
skills to help them navigate these complex decisions, 
9
which have serious and life-changing consequences. 
10
‘‘(7) School counseling programs are essential 
11
for students to achieve optimal personal growth, ac-
12
quire positive social skills and values, set appropriate 
13
career goals, and realize full academic potential to 
14
become productive, contributing members of the 
15
world community. 
16
‘‘(8) Professional secondary school counselors 
17
are highly qualified educators with a mental health 
18
perspective who understand and respond to the chal-
19
lenges presented by today’s diverse student popu-
20
lation.

‘‘(10) Professional secondary school counselors 
3
are integral to the total educational program. They 
4
provide proactive leadership that engages all stake-
5
holders in the delivery of programs and services to 
6
help the student achieve success in school. Profes-
7
sional secondary school counselors align and work 
8
with the school’s mission to support the academic 
9
achievement of all students as they prepare for the 
10
ever-changing world of the 21st century. 
11
‘‘(11) Professional secondary school counselors’ 
12
opportunities to assist students are often hindered 
13
by extraordinarily high student-to-counselor ratios. 
14
Currently, the average student-to-counselor ratio in 
15
America’s public schools is 471 to 1. The American 
16
School Counselor Association, the American Coun-
17
seling Association, and the National Association for 
18
College Admissions Counseling all recommend a 
19
ratio of one school counselor to 250 students and a 
20
lower ratio for counselors working primarily with 
21
students at risk.
