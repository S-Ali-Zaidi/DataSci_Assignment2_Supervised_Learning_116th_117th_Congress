SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
15
Congress finds that— 
16
(1) millions of citizens of the United States re-
17
side in territories of the United States; 
18
(2) the Federal Government owes a special duty 
19
of care and stewardship to the citizens of territories 
20
of the United States because— 
21
(A) historically, Federal administration of 
22
these territories was often wanting and many 
23
residents of the territories faced discriminatory 
24
treatment by the Federal Government; 
25
04:15 May 10, 2019
H2526
10 
•HR 2526 IH
(B) the economies of these territories face 
1
special constraints, including diminishment of 
2
property tax bases because of large, untaxed, 
3
Federal land holdings; and 
4
(C) these territories lack the benefits of 
5
many Federal programs, such as Supplemental 
6
Security Income, the Earned Income Tax Cred-
7
it, and full access to Medicaid; 
8
(3) prolonged economic downturns, declines in 
9
population, and natural disasters have resulted in 
10
some territories of the United States and the instru-
11
mentalities of those territories having unsupportable 
12
debt burdens on financial obligations, which cannot 
13
realistically be repaid without imposing undue hard-
14
ship on the citizens and residents of those terri-
15
tories; 
16
(4) disaster recovery funds that are provided by 
17
the Federal Government should be used for disaster 
18
recovery and not for direct or indirect debt pay-
19
ments; 
20
(5) unsecured creditors of financially distressed 
21
territories and instrumentalities of those territories 
22
have little prospect of recovery upon default because 
23
of— 
24
04:15 May 10, 2019
H2526
11 
•HR 2526 IH
(A) the severe indebtedness of those terri-
1
tories; and 
2
(B) the lack of effective remedies for unse-
3
cured creditors against those territories and the 
4
instrumentalities of those territories; and 
5
(6) the people of the Commonwealth of Puerto 
6
Rico deserve to know about the social, political, and 
7
legal factors associated with the amount of the pub-
8
lic debt of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico ac-
9
crued over the past 5 decades, and the Federal Gov-
10
ernment has a responsibility to support efforts to ob-
11
tain those answers, including public or private ef-
12
forts to conduct a comprehensive audit of the public 
13
debt of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
