RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the Haitian people and their Con-
stitution, rule of law, and commitment to democratic 
principles. 
Whereas, for the second time this year, the President of the 
Republic of Haiti has nominated a new head of Govern-
ment (a Prime Minister) along with a cabinet, while con-
sulting with the presidents of both chambers of the Par-
liament, in accordance with the Constitution of Haiti; 
Whereas in order to get sworn in, the Prime Minister has to 
get his general political plan approved by a simple major-
ity in each of the two chambers of Parliament; 
Whereas the lower chamber has approved that general polit-
ical plan on September 3, 2019, with a majority vote;

•HRES 619 IH 
Whereas, on September 11, 2019, the Senate was to hold a 
session to hear the general political plan of Mr. Michel, 
where the Senators needed to approve or reject it in 
order to form a government; 
Whereas the Parliament was vandalized for the second time 
this year to prevent the session from happening; 
Whereas these individuals intended to intimidate and create 
a chaotic environment; 
Whereas without a new functioning government, a budget 
cannot be passed, midterm elections cannot be organized, 
new agreements with international financial institutions 
(such as the International Monetary Fund and the Inter- 
American Development Bank) cannot be finalized, and 
many urgent matters cannot be addressed; 
Whereas in January of 2020, the term for the entire lower 
chamber and 2⁄3 of the Senate will expire, and the Presi-
dent could then rule by decree; and 
Whereas democracy in Haiti is in peril because of the actions 
of a few, which affect the short-term and long-term inter-
ests of all Haitians: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) condemns on a bipartisan basis the violence 
2
inside the Senate of Haiti on September 11, 2019, 
3
for disrupting constitutional process and the rule of 
4
law; 
5
(2) expresses support for the Haitian people 
6
and their Constitution, rule of law, and commitment 
7
to democratic principles;
