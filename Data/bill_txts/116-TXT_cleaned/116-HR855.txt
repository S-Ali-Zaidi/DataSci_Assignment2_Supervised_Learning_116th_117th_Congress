RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the United States should ratify the Rome Statute and 
join the International Criminal Court. 
Whereas crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, and 
war crimes are uniquely heinous and of global concern; 
Whereas the United States has been a global leader in the 
field of international criminal justice for atrocity crimes 
since the Nuremberg Trials; 
Whereas the fundamental principles of the rule of law and ac-
countability for atrocity crimes are central to the United 
States values and interests at home and abroad;

Whereas the United States has demonstrated its commitment 
to these values and interests by tangibly supporting nu-
merous domestic, international, and hybrid courts for 
atrocity crimes, including the International Criminal Tri-
bunal for the Former Yugoslavia, the International 
Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, the Special Court for Si-
erra Leone, the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of 
Cambodia, the Extraordinary African Chambers, and the 
Special Tribunal for Lebanon; 
Whereas the United States further demonstrates this commit-
ment by being party to the Convention on the Prevention 
and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, the United 
Nations Convention Against Torture, and the Geneva 
Conventions; 
Whereas the United States further demonstrates this commit-
ment by the existence of offices at the Department of 
Justice and the Department of Homeland Security that 
are dedicated to pursuing and apprehending the perpetra-
tors of atrocity crimes, as well as the existence of a dedi-
cated Office of Global Criminal Justice at the Depart-
ment of State; 
Whereas the United States signed the Rome Statute of the 
International Criminal Court on December 31, 2000, but 
has yet to ratify the statute and join the Court as a full 
member; 
Whereas the International Criminal Court is an important in-
stitution in the global fight against impunity for war 
crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide; 
Whereas the International Criminal Court operates on the 
principle of complementarity and as a court of last resort;

Whereas because of these principles, cases are not admissible 
before the International Criminal Court where they are 
being genuinely investigated or prosecuted before domes-
tic courts; 
Whereas despite the United States not being a member of the 
Court, administrations of both political parties have rec-
ognized its utility for the national interests of the United 
States; 
Whereas only by ratifying the Rome Statute and becoming a 
member of the International Criminal Court can the 
United States credibly shape the Court’s activities and 
priorities; 
Whereas the vast majority of the United States oldest and 
closest allies are state parties to the International Crimi-
nal Court; and 
Whereas it is in line with American values, interests, and 
proud history as a global leader in the fight against im-
punity and for justice that the United States becomes a 
full member of the International Criminal Court: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-
