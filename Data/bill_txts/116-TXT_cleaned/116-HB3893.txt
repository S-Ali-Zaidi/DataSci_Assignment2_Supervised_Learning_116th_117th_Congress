A BILL 
To direct the Secretary of Education to establish a program 
that awards grants to State coalitions that build or ex-
pand career pathways programs in schools within the 
State, and to direct the Secretary of Education to estab-
lish a program that awards grants to eligible agencies 
to carry out career pathways programs. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This act may be cited as the ‘‘School to Career Path-
4

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) In every congressional district, career and 
3
technical education programs and career-connected 
4
pathways programs play a vital role in ensuring 
5
workers remain competitive in high-wage, high-skill, 
6
and in-demand career fields, including information 
7
technology, health care, and the skilled trades, all of 
8
which have hundreds of thousands of job openings 
9
across the United States. 
10
(2) Every student should have access to career 
11
and technical education opportunities to learn how 
12
their academic background will prepare them for 
13
postsecondary education and a career. 
14
(3) Curriculum and course offerings should not 
15
be based on the assumption that every student has 
16
the same academic needs, interests, and goals. In-
17
stead, schools should prepare students for their indi-
18
vidualized career goals by providing opportunities for 
19
students to discover and delve into their interests. 
20
These opportunities may include career and tech-
21
nical education, personalized learning, apprentice-
22
ships, early college and dual enrollment, and lan-
23
guage immersion programs. 
24
(4) Specifically, career and technical education 
25
and dual enrollment programs integrate classroom 
26
00:08 Aug 13, 2019

•HR 3893 IH
learning with technical, job-specific skills to prepare 
1
students for high-skill careers in industries such as 
2
information 
technology, 
manufacturing, 
health 
3
science, nursing, medical professions, construction, 
4
engineering, and more. Under the Carl D. Perkins 
5
Vocational and Technical Education Act (20 U.S.C. 
6
2301), States receive funding to integrate career 
7
pathway programs with academic learning for stu-
8
dents who choose to enroll in career and technical 
9
education programs. 
10
(5) Career and technical education programs 
11
currently serve 12,500,000 high school and college 
12
students and boast a graduation rate of about 90 
13
percent, which is 15 percent higher than the na-
14
tional average. 
15
(6) Career-connected learning programs, which 
16
integrate college preparatory academics, technical 
17
training, work-based learning, and support, have had 
18
positive outcomes for students. 
19
(7) Six out of ten students plan to pursue a ca-
20
reer related to the career-connected learning pro-
21
grams they are exploring in high school. 
22
(8) According to the Census Bureau 33.4 per-
23
cent of individuals in the United States hold college 
24
degrees as of 2017, which falls drastically short of 
25
00:08 Aug 13, 2019
H3893

•HR 3893 IH
meeting the national need for skilled labor and dem-
1
onstrates that traditional college career paths only 
2
work for about 30 percent of individuals in the 
3
United States. 
4
(9) While career and technical education models 
5
have been piloted across the United States, grant 
6
programs need to be expanded to encourage addi-
7
tional school districts to offer students opportunities 
8
for career-connected learning, including apprentice-
9
ships, and project-based learning pathways. 
10
(10) Career and technical education programs 
11
should incentivize school districts to offer summer 
12
internships or course credit through opportunities 
13
created by business and community partnerships. 
14
