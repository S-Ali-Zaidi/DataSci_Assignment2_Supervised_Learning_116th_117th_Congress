tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Global Learning Loss 
4
Assessment Act of 2020’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 7911 IH
(1) Before the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (com-
1
monly referred to as ‘‘COVID-19’’) pandemic began, 
2
258 million children were out of school, including 
3
130 million girls. 
4
(2) Students already at a disadvantage before 
5
COVID-19 will experience greater learning loss, 
6
thereby worsening inequity and inequality. 
7
(3) Approximately 90 percent of the world’s 
8
student population—over 1.7 billion children and 
9
youth—have had their education disrupted by school 
10
closure due to COVID-19. 
11
(4) School closures lead to interrupted learning, 
12
poor nutrition, gaps in childcare, increased dropout, 
13
exposure to violence, and social isolation. 
14
(5) Up to 9.7 million children are at risk of 
15
dropping out of school due to rising levels of child 
16
poverty associated with the pandemic. 
17
(6) School closure and remote learning is espe-
18
cially burdensome on girls, who are frequently ex-
19
pected to shoulder more household chores and re-
20
sponsibilities, and are more vulnerable to gender- 
21
based violence. 
22
(7) During the Ebola epidemic, nationwide 
23
school closures in Sierra Leone in 2014 led to in-
24
creased instances of sexual and gender-based vio-
25

lence, teenage pregnancy, school dropout, and child 
1
labor for girls. 
2
(8) Over 60 percent of national distance learn-
3
ing alternatives rely exclusively on online platforms 
4
but as many as 465 million children and young peo-
5
ple in these countries do not have access to the 
6
internet at home, with 80 percent of students in 
7
sub-Saharan Africa without such access, and an 
8
even higher rate for girls. 
9
(9) Distance learning tools are not always ac-
10
cessible to learners with disabilities or those with 
11
complex learning needs, especially in poorer and 
12
rural households. 
13
(10) The economic downturn caused by the 
14
COVID-19 pandemic could lead to an education fi-
15
nancing gap of $77 billion in low- and middle-income 
16
countries over the next two years. 
17
(11) The economic cost of school closures could 
18
be up to $1,337 per student, which on a global scale 
19
equates to approximately $10 trillion in lost eco-
20
nomic output over the coming generation. 
21
SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
22
