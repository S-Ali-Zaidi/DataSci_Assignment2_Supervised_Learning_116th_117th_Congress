RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives regard-
ing the prevention of Iran from obtaining or developing 
nuclear weapons. 
Whereas it is in the vital interest of the United States and 
its allies to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons; 
Whereas Iran remains a leading state sponsor of terrorism, 
continues to develop and test missile technology in viola-
tion of United Nations Security Council resolutions, 
threatens United States forces and interests, continues to 
imprison American citizens, threatens regional allies and

partners, and utilizes proxies to destabilize the Middle 
East; 
Whereas these activities remain under non-nuclear sanctions 
and must be addressed through sustained diplomatic en-
gagement with Iran and our allies; 
Whereas the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) 
was agreed to by the P5+1 (the United States, the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China, France, Germany, the Russian 
Federation, the United Kingdom), and Iran on July 14, 
2015, and entered into effect on January 16, 2016, se-
curing an international agreement that effectively cut off 
all pathways to an Iranian nuclear weapon; 
Whereas the JCPOA was unanimously endorsed by the 
United Nations Security Council; 
Whereas the JCPOA committed Iran to implementing the 
Non-Proliferation Treaty that would prohibit Iran from 
ever seeking, developing, or acquiring any nuclear weap-
ons; 
Whereas the JCPOA allows for indefinite inspections and 
verification to ensure Iranian compliance, including 24- 
hour, 7-day-a-week inspections and mitigation mecha-
nisms for any potential violations; 
Whereas the JCPOA was solely intended to prevent Iran 
from obtaining nuclear weapons, allowing the United 
States and its allies to counter other Iranian malign ac-
tivities without Iran being shielded by a nuclear umbrella; 
Whereas the JCPOA resulted in Iran taking verifiable and 
concrete steps to eliminate 97 percent of its uranium 
stockpile, halt all uranium enrichment activities at the 
underground Fordow site, decommission over 13,000 cen-
trifuges and place them under international monitoring,

and destroy the core of its heavy-water reactor, thereby 
blocking production of weapons-grade plutonium; 
Whereas the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), 
United States verified that Iran remained in compliance 
with the terms of the JCPOA until July 2019; 
Whereas Iran’s decision to surpass limits on its low enriched 
uranium stockpile was a direct response to the Trump 
Administration’s unilateral violation of JCPOA; 
Whereas nothing in the JCPOA prevents the United States 
and its allies from seeking follow-on agreements with 
Iran, just as the United States has done with other inter-
national nonproliferation agreements and such agree-
ments may address expiring provisions under the 
JCPOA; 
Whereas President Donald J. Trump unilaterally violated the 
United States commitment to the JCPOA and United 
Nations Security Council Resolution 2231 by with-
drawing the United States from the agreement on May 
8, 2018; 
Whereas the United States unilateral withdrawal from the 
JCPOA has undermined United States global leadership 
and isolated the United States from its allies, leading al-
lies and any future negotiating partners to question the 
United States commitment to international agreements; 
Whereas the withdrawal of the United States from the 
JCPOA undermines global nuclear nonproliferation ef-
forts and jeopardizes the international community’s abil-
ity to maintain nuclear inspectors on the ground in Iran; 
Whereas the reimplementation of JCPOA-related secondary 
sanctions by the United States has led to the attempted 
creation of a vehicle to circumvent United States sanc-

tions, which undermines the influence of the United 
States in the global financial system and the United 
States global sanctions architecture; 
Whereas since withdrawing from the JCPOA, tensions with 
Iran have increased, and the Trump administration has 
failed to communicate or implement a viable and coordi-
nated strategy to curb Iranian activities at odds with the 
interests of the United States, greatly increasing the risk 
of a direct military confrontation; and 
Whereas the lack of sustained and principled diplomatic en-
gagement with Iran and the absence of United States- 
Iran deconfliction channels undermines the ability of the 
United States to deal with rising tensions with Iran: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-

(1) the JCPOA is a key international non-
