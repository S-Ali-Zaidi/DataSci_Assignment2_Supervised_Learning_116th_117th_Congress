RESOLUTION 
Supporting the goals and ideals of Engineers Week. 
Whereas engineers employ their scientific knowledge and ana-
lytical skills for the betterment of the United States, and 
for the protection of the public health, safety, and wel-
fare; 
Whereas the mission of the National Engineers Week Foun-
dation (doing business as DiscoverE) is to sustain and 
grow a dynamic engineering profession through outreach, 
education, celebration, and volunteerism as needed to

keep the United States a global leader in engineering and 
engineering education; 
Whereas the sponsors of Engineers Week are working to-
gether to transform the engineering workforce through 
greater inclusion of women and underrepresented minori-
ties; 
Whereas by engaging young students, parents, and educators 
in hands-on science, technology, engineering, and math 
(STEM) activities, engineers help them discover how they 
can make a meaningful difference in the world; 
Whereas the partnership between engineers and teachers in-
spires future generations of engineering and technology 
talent; 
Whereas tens of thousands of engineers and engineering stu-
dents will serve their communities not only through their 
work but, at this time of year, by reaching into hundreds 
of local communities; 
Whereas engineers have helped meet the major global chal-
lenges of our time, including providing state-of-the-art 
transportation and information technology infrastruc-
tures, enhancing national security, and developing the 
clean energy technologies needed to power the people of 
the United States into the future; 
Whereas ‘‘science creates more opportunity for the next gen-
eration’’, according to the National Science Board’s 
‘‘Science and Engineering Indicators 2018’’; 
Whereas engineers are a crucial link in research, develop-
ment, and the transformation of scientific discoveries into 
useful products and jobs, as the people of the United 
States look more than ever to engineers and their imagi-

nation, knowledge, and analytical skills to meet the chal-
lenges of the future; 
Whereas the National Science Board’s ‘‘Science and Engi-
neering Indicators 2018’’ shows that the number of stu-
dents obtaining engineering bachelor’s degrees in the 
United States has increased steadily for the last 15 years 
for which data are available, yet the rates for women do 
not reflect our national demographics, with only 20 per-
cent of bachelor’s degrees in engineering being earned by 
women; 
Whereas the National Science Board’s ‘‘Science and Engi-
neering Indicators 2018’’ shows that historically under-
represented racial and ethnic groups, particularly Blacks 
and Hispanics, continue to display lower participation 
rates in science and engineering (S&E) occupations rel-
ative to their presence in the United States population, 
comprising about 11 percent of the S&E workforce; 
Whereas the National Science Foundation’s National Center 
for Science and Engineering Statistics report on 
‘‘Women, Minorities, and Persons with Disabilities in 
Science and Engineering 2017’’ shows that women are 
closing the gap with men in S&E educational attainment 
but are still underrepresented in S&E occupations; 
Whereas only around 4 percent of the Nation’s workforce is 
comprised of scientists and engineers, yet this group dis-
proportionately creates jobs for the other 96 percent; 
Whereas DiscoverE has grown into a formal coalition of more 
than 100 professional societies, major corporations, and 
government agencies that serves as a hub of engineering 
outreach dedicated to ensuring a diverse and well-edu-
cated engineering workforce, promoting literacy in

science, technology, engineering, and math, and raising 
public awareness and appreciation of the contributions of 
engineers to society; 
Whereas the United States Congress has recognized National 
Engineers Week every year since 1951; and 
Whereas February 17, 2019, to February 23, 2019, has been 
designated as Engineers Week by DiscoverE and the 
theme is ‘‘Engineers: Invent Amazing’’, spotlighting the 
important contributions of the engineering community to 
our quality of life now and in the future, including awe- 
inspiring wonders like cloud-busting skyscrapers and 
human travel to Mars and daily marvels like clean drink-
ing water, computers, and cars: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the goals and ideals of Engineers 
2
Week to increase understanding of and interest in 
3
engineering and technology careers and to promote 
4
technological literacy and engineering education; 
5
(2) recognizes that engineering education is a 
6
critical component of STEM (science, technology, 
7
engineering, and mathematics) education and essen-
8
tial to improving the United States educational sys-
9
tem and economic prosperity; and 
10
(3) ensures that technological solutions de-
11
signed by the engineering community can be ad-
12
vanced through research, development, standardiza-
13
tion, and innovation.
