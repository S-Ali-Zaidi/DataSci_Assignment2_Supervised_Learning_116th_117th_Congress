Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives to 
recognize the crisis of violence against Native women. 
Whereas according to a study commissioned by the Depart-

the number of missing American Indian and Alaska Na-
tive women in the United States; 
Whereas American Indians and Alaska Natives are 2.5 times 
more likely to experience violent crimes and at least 2 
times more likely to experience rape or sexual assault 
crimes than people who are not American Indians or 
Alaska Natives; 
Whereas 96 percent of female and 89 percent of male Amer-
ican Indian and Alaska Native victims report being vic-
timized by a non-Indian; 
Whereas according to a 2010 Government Accountability Of-
fice report, the Offices of the United States Attorneys de-
clined to prosecute nearly 52 percent of violent crimes 
that occur in Indian country; 
Whereas Indian Tribes report that children are usually in-
volved in domestic violence and dating violence incidents 
that occur on Indian lands, either as witnesses or as vic-
tims themselves; 
Whereas the Indian Law and Order Commission issued a re-
port entitled ‘‘A Roadmap for Making Native America 
Safer’’, which recommends the restoration of the inherent 
authority of Tribal courts; and 
Whereas Tribal communities should be able to protect them-
selves from dating violence, domestic violence, and child 
violence, and from violence committed against members 
of the Tribal justice system: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives ex-
1
presses the sense of the House to recognize the crisis of

violence against Native women.
