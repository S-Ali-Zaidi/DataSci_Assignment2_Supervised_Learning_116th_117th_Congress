Whereas, in the 110th Congress, the NAACP was prominent 
in lobbying for the passage of H. Res. 826, a resolution 
with resolving clauses that express that the hanging of 
nooses is a horrible act when used for the purpose of in-
timidation, that under certain circumstances such an act 
can be criminal, and that such acts should be inves-
tigated thoroughly by Federal authorities and any crimi-
nal violations arising from such acts should be vigorously 
prosecuted; 
Whereas, in 2008, the NAACP vigorously supported the pas-
sage of the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act

bringing those who perpetrated such crimes to justice;

Whereas, in 2009, the NAACP was instrumental in the en-
actment of the Matthew Shepard–James Byrd, Jr., Hate

operation between Federal, State, and local authorities in 
the investigation and prosecution of crimes committed 
out of hate for a group of people; 
Whereas, in 2010, the NAACP, an advocate for sentencing 
reform, applauded the passage of the Fair Sentencing

mark piece of legislation that reduces the quantity of 
crack cocaine that triggers a mandatory minimum sen-

tence; 
Whereas throughout its existence, the NAACP has led the

minority communities; 
Whereas, in 2013, the NAACP signed a historic Memo-
