Congress makes the following findings:

•HR 2413 IH
(1) Since April 18, 2018, protesters in Nica-
1
ragua have demanded transparent government with-
2
out corruption, access to necessities such as food 
3
and medicines, and free, fair, multiparty elections. 
4
(2) The World Bank reported that Nicaragua’s 
5
economy contracted by 3.8 percent in 2018, and ex-
6
pects the economic downturn to continue to an esti-
7
mated decrease in growth of 5 percent in 2019. 
8
(3) The United States Department of State’s 
9
Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 
10
2018 stated that between the protests of April 18, 
11
2018, and late November 2018, at least 325 persons 
12
died, more than 2,000 were injured, and hundreds 
13
more were illegally detained and tortured, while 
14
more than 52,000 fled to neighboring countries. 
15
(4) The United States Department of State’s 
16
Country Reports on Human Rights for 2018 stated 
17
that ‘‘[h]uman rights deteriorated markedly during 
18
the year. Issues included reports of unlawful or arbi-
19
trary killings committed by the government or its 
20
agents; forced disappearance by parapolice forces; 
21
torture; physical abuse, including rape, by govern-
22
ment officials; and arbitrary arrest and detention. 
23
There were harsh and life-threatening prison condi-
24
tions; political prisoners; arbitrary and unlawful in-

terference with privacy; arrests of journalists, cen-
1
sorship, site blocking, and criminal libel; and sub-
2
stantial interference with the rights of peaceful as-
3
sembly and freedom of association, including attacks 
4
on the Roman Catholic Church and Church officials. 
5
The government stripped the legal status of several 
6
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and civil so-
7
ciety organizations, seizing their assets and pre-
8
venting them from operating. There was widespread 
9
corruption; trafficking in persons; attacks against 
10
lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex 
11
(LGBTI) persons; discrimination against ethnic mi-
12
norities and indigenous communities; and child 
13
labor.’’. 
14
(5) On February 22, 2019, Michelle Bachelet, 
15
the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, 
16
said, ‘‘I am deeply concerned about the apparent 
17
lack of due process and increasing criminalization of 
18
dissent in Nicaragua. The arrest and jailing of oppo-
19
sition leaders, possibly in some cases as a reprisal 
20
for cooperating with the UN, clearly hinders the cre-
21
ation of an environment conducive to holding a gen-
22
uine and inclusive dialogue—which the Government 
23
says it wants. . . . I also call on the authorities to 
24
release all those deprived of their liberty in connec-

tion with their intrinsic right to peaceful protest and 
1
dissent, and to ensure people who cooperate with the 
2
UN and other human rights organizations do not 
3
face reprisals. It is a fundamental tenet of democ-
4
racy that people from all parts of society should be 
5
able to engage freely in debate about the future of 
6
their country, without fear of arrest or intimida-
7
tion.’’. 
8
(6) On April 4, 2019, the Inter-American Com-
9
mission on Human Rights of the Organization of 
10
American States condemned the human rights 
11
abuses perpetrated by the Ortega regime, stating 
12
that, ‘‘[t]he acts of repression in question include il-
13
legal arbitrary arrests, the prohibition of all forms of 
14
social demonstration of protest, the refusal to re-es-
15
tablish the legal status of civil society organizations, 
16
and the increasing repression of people who are 
17
being deprived of their liberty. The IACHR once 
18
more calls for repression in the country to cease and 
19
for public liberties to be restored.’’. 
20
(7) International human rights groups such as 
21
Human Rights Watch, the Committee to Protect 
22
Journalists, and Reporters Without Borders have 
23
highlighted the Ortega regime’s efforts to silence 
24
independent media. For example, offices of Radio

Dario were burned down after the protests began in 
1
April 2018, Nicaragua’s most widely read newspaper 
2
La Prensa’s printing materials were confiscated in 
3
January 2019, and numerous journalists were ar-
4
rested and imprisoned since the protests began, 
5
while death threats and other intimidation tactics 
6
have forced dozens of journalists to flee the country. 
7
(8) In response to corruption and human rights 
8
abuses, the United States Department of Treasury 
9
has sanctioned six Nicaraguans for corruption and 
10
gross violations of human rights. Those sanctioned 
11
include the Vice President, who is the wife of cor-
12
rupt President Daniel Ortega, as well as the former 
13
President of the Supreme Electoral Council, the Di-
14
rector of the Nicaraguan National Police, a National 
15
Security Advisor to the President, the Political Sec-
16
retary for the municipality of Managua, and the 
17
Treasurer of the Sandinista Party. 
18
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
19
It is the sense of the Congress that— 
20
(1) Nicaragua’s economic, humanitarian, and 
21
human rights crisis has resulted in extraordinary 
22
and temporary conditions that currently prevent 
23
Nicaraguan nationals from safely returning to Nica-
24
ragua; and

3
of 18 months to permit nationals of Nicaragua to be

with such section.
