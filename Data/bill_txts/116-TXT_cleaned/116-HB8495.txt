(1) The intelligence community’s assessment of 
1
‘‘Russia’s Influence Campaign Targeting the 2016 
2
US Presidential Election’’, produced by the Central 
3
Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Inves-
4
tigation, and the National Security Agency and pub-
5
lished by the Office of the Director of National In-
6
telligence on January 6, 2017, found that the fol-
7
lowing: 
8
(A) Russian President Vladimir Putin or-
9
dered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at 
10
the United States presidential election. 
11
(B) Russian operations to influence the 
12
2016 United States presidential election dem-
13
onstrated a significant escalation in directness, 
14
level of activity, and scope of effort compared to 
15
previous operations aimed at undermining 
16
United States democratic institutions and 
17
order. 
18
(C) Russia will apply lessons learned from 
19
its Putin-ordered campaign aimed at the United 
20
States presidential election to future influence 
21
efforts worldwide, including against the United 
22
States and its allies and their election proc-
23
esses.

(2) In July 2018, Director of the Federal Bu-
1
reau of Investigation Christopher Wray publicly stat-
2
ed, ‘‘My view has not changed, which is that Russia 
3
attempted to interfere with the last election and that 
4
it continues to engage in malign influence operations 
5
to this day.’’ Director Wray also stated that Russia’s 
6
malign influence operations represent ‘‘a threat that 
7
we need to take extremely seriously and respond to 
8
with fierce determination and focus’’. 
9
(3) In August 2018, Director of National Intel-
10
ligence Dan Coates publicly stated that ‘‘We con-
11
tinue to see a pervasive messaging campaign by Rus-
12
sia to try to weaken and divide the United States.’’. 
13
In December 2018, Director Coates submitted the 
14
report of the intelligence community on foreign in-
15
terference in the 2018 midterm elections, which 
16
found that Russia continued to conduct influence ac-
17
tivities and messaging campaigns targeted at the 
18
United States to promote its strategic interests. 
19
(4) Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report, re-
20
leased in April 2019, concluded that, ‘‘The Russian 
21
government interfered in the 2016 presidential elec-
22
tion in a sweeping and systemic fashion.’’ On July 
23
24, 2019, during congressional testimony, Mueller 
24
noted that Russia’s malign efforts to interfere in 
25
04:18 Oct 29, 2020

•HR 8495 IH
United States elections were continuing ‘‘as we sit 
1
here’’. 
2
(5) On August 7, 2020, in an ‘‘Election Threat 
3
Update for the American Public’’, National Counter-
4
intelligence and Security Center Director William 
5
Evanina included Russia among foreign states of 
6
primary concern that continue to use covert and 
7
overt influence measures in its ‘‘attempts to sway 
8
U.S. voters’ preferences and perspectives, shift U.S. 
9
policies, increase discord in the United States, and 
10
undermine the American people’s confidence in our 
11
democratic process’’. 
12
(6) On September 10, 2020, the Department of 
13
the Treasury issued sanctions targeting a Russian 
14
agent and other Russia-linked individuals for inter-
15
ference in United States elections, including efforts 
16
to influence the 2020 United States presidential 
17
election. 
18
(7) On September 17, 2020, during congres-
19
sional testimony, FBI Director Wray stated that the 
20
intelligence community has observed ‘‘very active, 
21
very active, efforts by the Russians to influence our 
22
election in 2020’’, and that this has been done ‘‘to 
23
primarily to denigrate Vice President Biden in what 
24

the Russians see as a kind of an anti-Russian estab-

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE 
3
IN UNITED STATES ELECTIONS. 
4
It is the sense of Congress that—

interfere in the 2020 United States presidential elec-

tion;

(2) to date the United States has not subjected 
9
the Government of Russia to meaningful con-
10
sequences for its interference in United States elec-
11
tions; and 
12
(3) the imposition of significant economic sanc-
13
tions against the Government of Russia is appro-
14
priate to deter continued Russian interference in 
15
United States elections.
