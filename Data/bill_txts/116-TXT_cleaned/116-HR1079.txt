15, 2020, as National Health Center Week and encour-
ages all Americans to take part in this week by visiting 
their local health center and celebrating the important 
partnership between America’s community health centers 
and the communities they serve. 
Whereas for over 50 years, community health centers have 
provided high-quality, affordable, and comprehensive pri-
mary and preventive health care in our Nation’s under-
served communities, delivering value to, and having a sig-
nificant impact on America’s health care system; 
Whereas the country’s largest primary care network, commu-
nity health centers are the health care home for 
30,000,000 Americans in over 14,000 communities across 
the Nation; 
Whereas 1 in every 12 people in the United States gets care 
in a community health center; 
Whereas community health centers are a critical element of 
the health system, serving both rural and urban commu-
nities, and often providing the only accessible and de-
pendable source of primary care in their communities; 
Whereas nationwide, community health centers serve 1 in 
every 5 residents of rural areas; 
Whereas every day, community health centers develop new 
approaches to integrating a wide range of services beyond 
primary care, including oral health, vision, behavioral 
health, and pharmacy services, to meet the needs and 
challenges of their communities; 
Whereas community health centers are governed by patient- 
majority boards, ensuring that the patients of each health 
center are engaged in their own health care decisions;

Whereas community health centers are locally owned and op-
erated small businesses that serve as critical economic en-
gines, helping to power local economies by generating 
$54,600,000,000 in economic activity in some of the 
country’s most economically deprived communities; 
Whereas community health centers nationally employ more 
than 236,000 people, including physicians, nurse practi-
tioners, physician assistants, and certified nurse midwives 
who work as part of multi-disciplinary clinical teams de-
signed to treat the whole patient; 
Whereas the community health center model continues to 
prove an effective means of overcoming barriers to health 
care access, including geography, income, and insurance 
status, improving health care outcomes and reducing 
health care system costs; 
Whereas community health centers reduce overall costs of 
care by helping manage chronic conditions of patients, 
which keeps them out of costlier health care settings like 
hospital emergency rooms; 
Whereas community health centers are on the front lines of 
emerging health care crises, providing access to care for 
our Nation’s veterans, addressing the opioid epidemic, 
and responding to public health threats in the wake of 
natural disasters; 
Whereas community health centers serve as beacons of essen-
tial resources and support in testing and treatment in the 
face of the global coronavirus pandemic, and will continue 
to offer reliable, affordable, and high-quality care against 
COVID–19 for America’s most vulnerable and under-
served communities;

Whereas during the COVID–19 pandemic, health centers 
served as front line responders and were able to provide 
tests to 1,549,690 patients over a 4-month period; 
Whereas National Health Center Week offers the opportunity 
to celebrate America’s over 1,400 health center organiza-
tions with over 12,000 service delivery sites, their dedi-
cated staff, board members, patients, and all those re-
sponsible for their continued success and growth since 
the first health centers opened their doors more than 50 
years ago; and 
Whereas during National Health Center Week, we celebrate 
the legacy of America’s community health centers, and 
their vital role in shaping the past, present, and future 
of America’s health care system: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
