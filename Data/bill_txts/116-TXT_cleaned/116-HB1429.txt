SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Investments in infrastructure create jobs 
3
while 
fulfilling 
critical 
needs 
in 
communities 
4
throughout the United States. 
5
(2) According to the Brookings Institution, 
6
nearly 14.5 million workers—11 percent of the U.S. 
7
workforce—were employed in infrastructure jobs in 
8
2013. 
9
(3) According to data from the Brookings Insti-
10
tution, infrastructure occupations often provide more 
11
competitive and equitable wages in comparison to all 
12
jobs nationally, consistently paying up to 30 percent 
13
more to low-income workers. 
14
(4) The American Society of Civil Engineers 
15
gave the infrastructure of the United States an over-
16
all grade of ‘‘D+’’ in 2017 and estimated that the 
17
United States will need to invest $4.59 trillion by 
18
2025 in order to improve the condition of the Na-
19
tion’s infrastructure and bring it to a state of good 
20
repair. 
21
(5) The American Society of Civil Engineers as-
22
signed a ‘‘D’’ grade to the Nation’s drinking water 
23
infrastructure and a ‘‘D+’’ grade to the Nation’s 
24
wastewater infrastructure and estimated that the 
25

•HR 1429 IH
United States will need to invest $150 billion by 
1
2025 to bring them to a state of good repair. 
2
(6) According to the American Society of Civil 
3
Engineers, there are an estimated 240,000 water 
4
main breaks per year in the United States, wasting 
5
over two trillion gallons of treated drinking water. 
6
(7) In 2016, the U.S. Environmental Protection 
7
Agency (EPA) reported that although exposure to 
8
lead can cause serious health problems, including 
9
damage to the brain and nervous system in children 
10
and kidney problems and high blood pressure in 
11
adults, an estimated 6.5 to 10 million homes nation-
12
wide receive drinking water through lead service 
13
lines. 
14
(8) Congress created the Drinking Water State 
15
Revolving Funds in 1996 to help eligible public 
16
water systems finance infrastructure projects in 
17
order to comply with Federal drinking water regula-
18
tions and meet the health objectives of the Safe 
19
Drinking Water Act. 
20
(9) The EPA is required periodically to conduct 
21
a survey of the capital improvement needs of eligible 
22
public water systems and distribute funding appro-
23
priated for the Drinking Water State Revolving 
24

Funds among the States based on the results of the 
1
most recent survey. 
2
(10) In March of 2018, the EPA issued the 
3
2015 Drinking Water Needs Survey and Assess-
4
ment, which is the most recent survey of the capital 
5
improvement needs of eligible public water systems 
6
and which estimated that $472.6 billion in improve-
7
ments are needed for the Nation’s drinking water in-
8
frastructure over 20 years in order to ensure the 
9
safety of drinking water. 
10
(11) In fiscal year 2018, Congress appropriated 
11
$1.163 billion for the Drinking Water State Revolv-
12
ing Funds to enable States to provide grants and fi-
13
nancing assistance to eligible public water systems in 
14
order to improve drinking water infrastructure in 
15
communities throughout the United States. 
16
(12) Past appropriations for the Drinking 
17
Water State Revolving Funds are not sufficient to 
18
address the tremendous need for investments in 
19
drinking 
water 
infrastructure 
in 
communities 
20
throughout the United States. 
21
(13) Appropriating $7.5 billion in fiscal year 
22
2019 for the Drinking Water State Revolving 
23
Funds, and allowing the funds to remain available 
24
for 6 years, will enable States to begin immediately

to expand investments in drinking water infrastruc-
1
ture in communities throughout the United States. 
2
(14) Restricting appropriations for the Drink-
3
ing Water State Revolving Funds through the use of 
4
arbitrary budget caps or sequestration undermines 
5
economic recovery and job creation efforts; disrupts 
6
planning by States, local communities, and eligible 
7
public water systems; and leaves critical infrastruc-
8
ture needs unmet. 
9
(15) Emergency supplemental appropriations 
10
for the Drinking Water State Revolving Funds, pro-
11
vided in addition to other appropriations and not 
12
subject to sequestration, will improve drinking water 
13
infrastructure and create jobs throughout the United 
14
States without reducing funding for other domestic 
15
priorities. 
16
(16) An emergency supplemental appropriation 
17
of $7.5 billion for the Drinking Water State Revolv-
18
ing Funds to be made available in fiscal year 2019, 
19
and to remain available for 6 years, will allow States 
20
to begin immediately to distribute funds to eligible 
21
public water systems and allow local communities 
22
and eligible public water systems to develop and im-
