(1) From 2015–2016, 3,900,000 students 
1
dropped out of college while holding Federal student 
2
debt. 
3
(2) Approximately half of students who dropped 
4
out with debt did so because they were unable to se-
5
cure funding to affordably continue their studies. 
6
(3) Students who drop out are 4.2 times more 
7
likely to default on their loans than students who 
8
graduated and comprise 63 percent of defaults, in 
9
large part because they don’t receive the increase in 
10
earnings that comes along with a degree. 
11
(4) Eliminating the time limit on taking out 
12
federally subsidized loans would allow students who 
13
have not hit the borrowing limit to continue to get 
14
the funding they need to graduate, and would give 
15
students more flexibility throughout their education. 
16
(5) Eliminating the time limit on taking out 
17
federally subsidized loans would ease the administra-
18
tive burden on colleges’ financial aid offices so they 
19
can spend their time focused on helping students 
20
succeed.
