and widespread destruction of both public and private 
property, some tied to interstate commerce, that is rav-
aging our communities and being carried out by violent 
mobs, criminals, and domestic terrorists; 
Whereas ‘‘domestic terrorism’’ is defined under section 
2331(5) of title 18, United States Code, as violent crimes 
perpetrated against civilians to intimidate or coerce for 
the purpose of influencing government policy; 
Whereas numerous Federal crimes are continuously being 
committed, including— 
(1) advocating the violent overthrow of government; 
(2) aggravated assault and battery; 
(3) arson; 
(4) assault with a deadly weapon; 
(5) assaulting or killing Federal law enforcement of-
ficer; 
(6) conspiracy to impede or injure a Federal officer; 
(7) damage to Federal property; 
(8) destruction of memorials; 
(9) shoplifting; 
(10) trespassing; 
(11) looting; and 
(12) use of fire or explosives (including fireworks) to 
destroy property or injure Federal officers. 
Whereas some local, State, and Federal elected officials are 
either incapable of or unwilling to stop it; and 
Whereas these actions must be prosecuted to the fullest ex-
tent of the law and Federal law enforcement, property, 
and the constitutional rights of United States citizens 
must immediately be protected: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
