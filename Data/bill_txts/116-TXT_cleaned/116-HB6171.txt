tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

Congress finds the following:

•HR 6171 IH
(1) In 2018, the United Nations Intergovern-
1
mental Panel on Climate Change released a report 
2
that found that global warming could reach 1.5 de-
3
grees Celsius above average temperature levels by 
4
the year 2030. 
5
(2) The report outlined the potential impacts 
6
and associated risks of a temperature increase of 1.5 
7
degrees Celsius, including increasing— 
8
(A) intensity and frequency of droughts; 
9
(B) frequency and amount of heavy pre-
10
cipitation; and 
11
(C) other extreme weather events. 
12
(3) The report found that in order to avoid the 
13
impacts of a temperature increase of 1.5 degrees 
14
Celsius, greenhouse gas emissions must be re-
15
duced— 
16
(A) between 40 to 60 percent below the 
17
level of greenhouse gas emissions recorded in 
18
the year 2010 by the year 2030; and 
19
(B) to net zero emissions by the year 
20
2050. 
21
(4) According to a report by the Environmental 
22
Protection Agency entitled ‘‘Inventory of U.S. 
23
Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks’’, transpor-
24
tation activities accounted for the largest portion 
25
00:26 Mar 17, 2020
H6171
3 
•HR 6171 IH
(approximately 29.9 percent) of total greenhouse gas 
1
emissions in the United States in 2017. 
2
(5) The Secretary of Transportation has a lead-
3
ing role in reducing United States greenhouse gas 
4
emissions since transportation activities continue to 
5
account for a large portion of total greenhouse gas 
6
emissions in the United States. 
7
(6) Reducing greenhouse gas emissions will 
8
demonstrate adherence to the commitments of the 
9
United States under the Paris Agreement, and any 
10
other similar international climate change agree-
11
ments.

SEC. 3. NATIONAL STRATEGIC ACTION PLAN TO REDUCE 
13
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. 
14
(a) REQUIREMENT.—Not later than 2 years after the 
15
date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary, using the 
16
best available science and in collaboration with the Admin-
17
istrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, shall 
18
publish an action plan known as the ‘‘National Strategic 
19
Action Plan’’ (in this Act referred to as the ‘‘action plan’’) 
20
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the transportation 
21
sector to the emissions target by the year 2040. 
22
(b) CONTENT.—The action plan may include— 
23
(1) The implementation of strategies that in-
24
crease the usage of passenger rail, public transpor-

tation systems, walking, cycling, and other low-car-
1
bon modes of transportation including— 
2
(A) improvements to infrastructure; and 
3
(B) changes to engineering and design 
4
guidelines, including the Manual on Uniform 
5
Control Devices for Streets and Highways or 
6
current design criteria codified under part 625, 
7
title 23 of the United States Code of Federal 
8
Regulations. 
9
(2) Strategies and policies that reduce Vehicle 
10
Miles Traveled (VMT), including— 
11
(A) the promotion of transit oriented or 
12
transit accessible development; 
13
(B) access to jobs and services as a metric 
14
to measure transportation success instead of 
15
level of service; and 
16
(C) more efficient land use or walkable 
17
communities; 
18
(3) recommendations for tax incentives for the 
19
adoption of technology that produces low levels of 
20
greenhouse gas emissions; 
21
(4) the development of transportation tech-
22
nology that dramatically reduces existing greenhouse 
23
gas emissions or produces low levels of greenhouse 
24
gas emissions, including—
