SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Most Americans, including most children 
3
and adolescents, consume on average only about half 
4
of the recommended amounts of dairy foods daily. 
5
(2) Milk is a source of many nutrients essential 
6
to health, and is the leading source of nine essential 
7
nutrients in the diets of children and adolescents, in-
8
cluding three nutrients of public health concern: vi-
9
tamin D, calcium, and potassium. 
10
(3) Dairy foods are associated with improved 
11
bone health, a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, a bene-
12
ficial or neutral effect on blood pressure, and may 
13
help reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, coro-
14
nary heart disease, and stroke. 
15
(4) In a September 2019 report on beverage 
16
recommendations for early childhood, the Academy 
17
of Nutrition and Dietetics, American Academy of 
18
Pediatric Dentists, American Academy of Pediatrics, 
19
and the American Heart Association found that— 
20
(A) medical professionals are in agreement 
21
that whole milk is good for childhood develop-
22
ment; 
23
(B) skim and low-fat milk are rec-
24
ommended for young children;

(C) plant-based, non-dairy milks are not 
1
recommended for young children; and 
2
(D) an expert panel under the study recog-
3
nized that there has been recent research and 
4
discussion regarding the role of dairy fat in 
5
healthy dietary patterns but in the absence of 
6
clear evidence justifying a departure from cur-
7
rent recommendations, such expert panel chose 
8
to remain consistent with current guidance rec-
9
ommending whole milk for most children ages 
10
12 to 24 months and fat-free (skim) or low-fat 
11
(1 percent) milk for children ages 2 years and

older.
