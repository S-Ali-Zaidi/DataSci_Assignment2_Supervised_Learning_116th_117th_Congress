RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
there should be a direct emergency economic stimulus 
for individual Americans in response to COVID–19. 
Whereas the COVID–19 has rapidly spread throughout the 
entire world, creating a widespread outbreak that has 
been deemed a public health emergency in the United 
States and has been declared a global pandemic by the 
World Health Organization; 
Whereas COVID–19 has created a threat to the American 
public and the economic stability of our Nation, and 
American families will require immediate economic relief 
to survive the short- and long-term effects of the out-
break;

Whereas COVID–19 poses an especially high health threat, 
which has led to numerous safety measures that, by ne-
cessity, will keep people away from their daily routines 
and activities, such as going to work, school, shopping for 
food and medicine, and other impactful economic activi-
ties, triggering an economic slowdown, which will heavily 
affect many industries; 
Whereas these necessary safety measures inevitably will eco-
nomically hurt our working-class and low-income families, 
many of whom will not be able to go to work because 
they or their loved ones are infected or quarantined, or 
because they are caring for an individual affected by clo-
sures triggered by the outbreak; 
Whereas thousands of American families will require direct 
economic relief that will immediately affect their ability 
to purchase medicine and other essential goods and serv-
ices, also enabling them to continue contributing to the 
economy; 
Whereas the Federal Government should more readily provide 
and prioritize direct economic relief for the American 
people, the majority of which are living paycheck to pay-
check, rather than bailing out Wall Street banks and 
large corporations and industries; and 
Whereas every individual taxpayer should receive the direct 
assistance necessary to weather the effects of this global 
pandemic, and Congress must ensure that individuals 
most impacted by this crisis will receive economic relief 
to address their financial needs, including assistance with 
mortgage payments, student loans, and other debt obliga-
tions: Now, therefore, be it
