(1) The Government of the Kingdom of Saudi 
8

mental progress in removing intolerant content in 
1
state-published textbooks. 
2
(2) Saudi Arabia has committed to educational 
3
reforms through its Vision 2030 and National 
4
Transformation Program, and is an important part-
5
ner of the United States in combating terrorism and 
6
violent extremism. 
7
(3) The 2006 ‘‘confirmation of policies’’ nego-
8
tiated by the United States and Saudi Arabia stated 
9
that textbooks would be revised within one or two 
10
years ‘‘to remove remaining intolerant references 
11
that disparage Muslims or non-Muslims or that pro-
12
mote hatred toward other religions or religious 
13
groups.’’. 
14
(4) According to the Department of State’s Au-
15
gust 2017 International Religious Freedom Report, 
16
‘‘[t]he government continued to distribute revised 
17
textbooks, although some intolerant material re-
18
mained in circulation, particularly at the high school 
19
level, including content justifying the execution of 
20
‘sorcerers’ ’’ and social exclusion of non-Muslims. 
21
(5) Saudi textbooks have been exported inter-
22
nationally, including to countries in the Middle East, 
23
Africa, South, Central, and South East Asia, and 
24
parts of Europe and North America.

(6) The International Religious Freedom Act of 
1
1998 requires the President to designate countries 
2
in which violations of religious freedom are ‘‘system-
3
atic, ongoing, [and] egregious’’ as countries of par-
4
ticular concern. 
5
(7) The President has designated Saudi Arabia 
6
as a country of particular concern since 2004, pur-
7
suant to the International Religious Freedom Act of 
8
1998, and a waiver of further action has been in 
9
place since 2006. 
10
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
11
It is the sense of Congress that, in spite of some 
12
progress, Saudi Arabia has not yet sufficiently met its 
13
commitments for eliminating all forms of incitement from 
14
its educational materials and curriculum in line with its 
15
commitments to combat terrorism and violent extremism. 
16
