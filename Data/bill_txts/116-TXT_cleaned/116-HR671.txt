RESOLUTION 
Urging the United Arab Emirates to immediately end any 
activities enabling money laundering in violation of 
United States sanctions against Iran. 
Whereas the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has undertaken 
efforts to coordinate with United States partners to 
counter money laundering and terrorist financing and has 
participated in regional bodies to counter money laun-
dering such as the Middle East and North Africa Finan-
cial Action Task Force; 
Whereas recent efforts by the UAE to restrain illicit money 
transfers remain insufficient in addressing concerns 
about the evasion of United States sanctions and money

voted to investigating, prosecuting and disrupting money 
laundering’’, according to the Department’s ‘‘Narcotics 
Control Strategy Report’’; 
Whereas the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign 
Assets Control (OFAC) designated 11 entities and indi-
viduals involved in procurement on behalf of Iran’s bal-
listic missile program in 2016; 
Whereas, in 2016, OFAC sanctioned Mabrooka Trading Co 
LLC (Mabrooka Trading)—based in the UAE—and its 
China- and UAE-based network that have been involved 
in procuring goods for Iran’s ballistic missile program; 
Whereas OFAC targeted two Iranian regime-linked networks 
pursuant to Executive Order 13382 (2005) for engaging 
in covert procurement activities benefitting multiple Ira-
nian military organizations in August 2019; 
Whereas the second network targeted by OFAC in August 
2019 was led by Seyed Hossein Shariat and procured 
various aluminum alloy products on behalf of components 
entities owned or controlled by Iran’s Ministry of Defense 
and Armed Forces Logistics; and 
Whereas the UAE’s lax enforcement of its antiproliferation 
export control laws have facilitated these violations of 
United States sanctions policy: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) condemns the failure of the United Arab

Emirates (UAE) to effectively counter money laun-

dering activities conducted by Iranian companies to
