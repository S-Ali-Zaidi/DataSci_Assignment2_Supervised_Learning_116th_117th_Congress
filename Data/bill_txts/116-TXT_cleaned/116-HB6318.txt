SEC. 213. FINDINGS. 
3
The Congress finds as follows: 
4
(1) Youth gang crime has taken a toll on a 
5
number of communities, and senseless acts of gang- 
6
related violence have imposed economic, social, and 
7
human costs. 
8
(2) Drug- and alcohol-dependent youth, and 
9
youth dually diagnosed with addiction and mental 
10
health disorders, are more likely to become involved 
11
with the juvenile justice system than youth without 
12
such risk factors, absent appropriate prevention and 
13
intervention services. 
14
(3) Children of color are over-represented rel-
15
ative to the general population at every stage of the 
16
juvenile justice system. Black youth are 17 percent 
17
of the United States population, but represent 38 
18
percent of youth in secure placement juvenile facili-
19
ties, and 58 percent of youth incarcerated in adult 
20
prisons. 
21
(4) Research funded by the Department of Jus-
22
tice indicates that gang membership is short-lived 
23
among adolescents. With very few youth remaining 
24
21:21 Apr 22, 2020
H6318
63 
HR 6318 IH1S 
gang-involved throughout their adolescent years, on-
1
going opportunities for intervention exist. 
2
(5) Criminal justice costs have become burden-
3
some in many States and cities, requiring reductions 
4
in vital educational, social, welfare, mental health, 
5
and related services. 
6
(6) Direct expenditures for each of the major 
7
criminal justice functions, police, corrections, and ju-
8
dicial services, have increased steadily over the last 
9
30 years. In fiscal year 2012, Federal, State, and 
10
local 
governments 
spent 
an 
estimated 
11
$265,000,000,000 for police protection, corrections, 
12
and judicial and legal services, nearly a 213-percent 
13
increase since 1982. 
14
(7) Estimates suggest that each year the 
15
United States incurs over $8,000,000,000 in long- 
16
term costs for the confinement of young people. The 
17
average annual cost to incarcerate one youth is 
18
$146,302. 
19
(8) Coordinated efforts of stakeholders in the 
20
juvenile justice system in a local community, to-
21
gether with other organizations and community 
22
members concerned with the safety and welfare of 
23
children, have a strong record of demonstrated suc-
24
cess in reducing the impact of youth and gang-re-

lated crime and violence, as demonstrated in Boston, 
1
Massachusetts; Chicago, Illinois; Richmond, Vir-
2
ginia; Los Angeles, California; and other commu-
3
nities. 
4
(9) Investment in prevention and intervention 
5
programs for children and youth, including quality 
6
early childhood programs, comprehensive evidence- 
7
based school, after school, and summer school pro-
8
grams, mentoring programs, mental health and 
9
treatment programs, evidence-based job training 
10
programs, and alternative intervention programs, 
11
has been shown to lead to decreased youth arrests, 
12
decreased delinquency, lower recidivism, and greater 
13
financial savings from an educational, economic, so-
14
cial, and criminal justice perspective. 
15
(10) Quality early childhood education pro-
16
grams have been demonstrated to help children start 
17
school ready to learn and to reduce delinquency and 
18
criminal street gang activity risks. 
19
(11) Evidence-based mentoring programs have 
20
been shown to prevent youth drug abuse and vio-
21
lence. 
22
(12) Evidence-based school-based comprehen-
23
sive instructional programs that pair youth with re-
24
21:21 Apr 22, 2020
H6318
65 
HR 6318 IH1S 
sponsible adult mentors have been shown to have a 
1
strong impact upon delinquency prevention. 
2
(13) After-school programs that connect chil-
3
dren to caring adults and that provide constructive 
4
activities during the peak hours of juvenile delin-
5
quency and criminal street gang activity, between 3 
6
p.m. and 6 p.m., have been shown to reduce delin-
7
quency and the attendant costs imposed on the juve-
8
nile and criminal justice systems. 
9
(14) States with higher levels of educational at-
10
tainment have been shown to have crime rates lower 
11
than the national average. Researchers have found 
12
that a 5-percent increase in male high school grad-
13
uation rates would produce an annual estimated sav-
14
ings of $18,500,000,000 in crime-related expenses. 
15
(15) Therapeutic programs that engage and 
16
motivate high-risk youth and their families to 
17
change behaviors that often result in criminal activ-
18
ity have been shown to significantly reduce recidi-
19
vism among juvenile offenders, and significantly re-
20
duce the attendant costs of crime and delinquency 
21
imposed upon the juvenile and criminal justice sys-
22
tems. 
23
(16) Comprehensive programs that target kids 
24
who are already serious juvenile offenders by ad-
25

H6318
66 
HR 6318 IH1S 
dressing the multiple factors in peer, school, neigh-
1
borhood, and family environments known to be re-
2
lated to delinquency can reduce recidivism among ju-
3
venile offenders and save the public significant eco-
4
nomic costs. 
5
(17) There are many alternatives to incarcer-
6
ation of youth that have been proven to be more ef-
7
fective in reducing crime and violence at the Na-
8
tional, State, local, and tribal levels, and the failure 
9
to provide for such effective alternatives is a perva-
10
sive problem that leads to increased youth, and later 
11
adult, crime and violence. 
12
(18) Savings achieved through early interven-
13
tion and prevention are significant, especially when 
14
noncriminal 
justice 
social, 
educational, 
mental 
15
health, and economic outcomes are considered. 
16
(19) The prevention of child abuse and neglect 
17
can help stop a cycle of violence and save up to 
18
$5.00 for every $1.00 invested in preventing such 
19
abuse and neglect. 
20
(20) Targeting interventions at special youth 
21
risk groups and focusing upon relatively low-cost 
22
interventions increases the probability of fiscal ben-
23
efit.

1
cilities have been shown to reduce youth delinquency 
2
and to be cost-effective. 
3
(22) States, including Wisconsin, Ohio, New 
4
York, Texas, and Pennsylvania, have seen a reduc-
5
tion in juvenile incarceration due to a reallocation of 
6
criminal justice funds towards prevention programs.
