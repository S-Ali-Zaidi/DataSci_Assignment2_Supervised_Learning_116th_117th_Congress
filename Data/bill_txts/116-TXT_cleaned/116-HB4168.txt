1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

•HR 4168 IH
(1) According to the Equal Employment Oppor-
1
tunity Commission (EEOC) and the Census Bureau, 
2
which together provide detail on the racial composi-
3
tion of government workers in large American cities, 
4
in about two-thirds of the United States cities with 
5
the largest police forces, the majority of police offi-
6
cers live outside of the city in which they work. 
7
(2) When officers live in the cities in which they 
8
work, it may reduce the carbon footprint by employ-
9
ees in their journey to work, foster more employee 
10
concern in the affairs of their city, ensure manpower 
11
will be available in case of emergencies, generate ad-
12
ditional tax revenue for the city, and cut down on 
13
absenteeism and tardiness. 
14
(3) According to a New York Times article en-
15
titled, ‘‘When Police Don’t Live in the City They 
16
Serve (2016)’’, trust is greater between community 
17
and police force when officers live in and are demo-
18
graphically representative of the communities they 
19
police. 
20
(4) Existing programs, such as the Secure 
21
Neighborhoods Pathways to Homeownership in At-
22
lanta, are strengthening police legitimacy and cre-
23
ating more cooperative relationships with civilians 
24
across racial lines which holds promise for reducing

crime and violence. As a result of this program, the 
1
percentage of Atlanta’s police force, living in the city 
2
of Atlanta, increased from 14 percent to 22 percent. 
3
(5) Strained ties between police departments 
4
and the communities they serve predate the 1960s 
5
civil rights movement. During and after the civil 
6
rights movement, activists across the country have 
7
marched in support of improved police-community 
8
relations. 
9
(6) Police officers have an important job to 
10
maintain the safety, security, and resiliency of the 
11
cities they serve. By residing in the same commu-
12
nities in which they serve, officers may have oppor-
13
tunities to ameliorate their relationships with com-
14
munity residents and heal relationships between po-
15
lice and communities. 
16
(7) Substantive criminal justice reform should 
17
include initiatives to ameliorate the relationships po-
18
lice officers have with the communities they serve.
