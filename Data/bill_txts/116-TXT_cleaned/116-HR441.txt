lution of this case and encouraging accountability for 
the attack.

tack to the terrorist group Hezbollah, which is based in 
Lebanon, supported by the Government of the Syrian

wanted list—Ali Fallahijan, Mohsen Rabbani, Ahmad 
Reza Asghari, Ahmad Vahidi, and Mohsen Razaee from 
Iran and Imad Fayez Moughnieh from Lebanon; 
Whereas Interpol currently has 4 red alerts in place in rela-
tion to the AMIA attack; 
Whereas, on January 13, 2015, prosecutor Alberto Nisman 
alleged in a complaint that then-Argentinian President 
Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner and then-Minister of

up Iranian involvement in the 1994 terrorist bombing, 
and reportedly agreed to negotiate immunity for Iranian 
suspects and help get their names removed from the 
INTERPOL list;

his new findings to the Argentinian Congress on January

2015; 
Whereas the investigation of the AMIA bombing has been 
marked by judicial misconduct; 
Whereas, in March 2019, an Argentine court handed down 
convictions and sentences, finding that the judge, pros-
ecutors, and head of the Argentina’s secret services—the 
individuals responsible for investigating the AMIA bomb-
ing, Argentina’s deadliest terrorist attack—had interfered 
with the inquiry, diverting the investigation away from 
the truth; 
Whereas former Federal judge Juan Jose´ Galeano was hand-
ed down a 6-year conviction by the court, which will not

ligence head Hugo Anzorreguy was handed a prison sen-
tence of 54 months;

faced prosecution: Now, therefore, be it
