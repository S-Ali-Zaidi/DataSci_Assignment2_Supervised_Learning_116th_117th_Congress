RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the Federal Government should establish a national goal 
of conserving at least 30 percent of the land and ocean 
of the United States by 2030. 
Whereas access to public land, nature, and a healthy environ-
ment should be a right for all people, as that access is 
essential to the health, well-being, identity, cultures, and 
economic prosperity of the United States; 
Whereas the United States faces a conservation and climate 
crisis, with nature in a steep decline and greenhouse gas 
emissions not declining at the rate scientists say is need-
ed in the United States and worldwide;

Whereas scientists are documenting a rapid loss of natural 
areas and wildlife in the United States and throughout 
the world, including— 
(1) a finding that, from 2001 to 2017, a quantity 
of natural areas equal to the size of a football field dis-
appeared to development every 30 seconds in the United 
States, constituting more than 1,500,000 acres per year; 
(2) a finding, published in the journal ‘‘Science’’, 
that 
the 
United 
States 
and 
Canada 
have 
lost 
2,900,000,000 birds since 1970, representing a decline of 
29 percent; 
(3) the identification by State fish and game agen-
cies of approximately 12,000 animal and plant species in 
the United States that require proactive conservation ef-
forts to avoid extinction, of which approximately 1⁄3 will 
be lost in the next decades; 
(4) a finding by the United States Fish and Wildlife 
Service that the United States has lost more than 1⁄2 of 
all freshwater and saltwater wetlands in the contiguous 
48 States; and 
(5) the 2019 findings by the Intergovernmental 
Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem 
Services that— 
(A) human activities are damaging 2⁄3 of ocean 
areas; 
(B) only 3 percent of ocean areas remain pris-
tine; 
(C) 15 percent of mangroves remain; 
(D) 50 percent of coral reefs remain; and 
(E) at the current rate of losses, less than 10 
percent of the Earth will be free of substantial 
human impact by 2050;

Whereas climate change is accelerating the decline of nature 
in the United States; 
Whereas the Third National Climate Assessment found that 
climate change— 
(1) is reducing the ability of ecosystems to provide 
clean water and regulate water flows; 
(2) is limiting the ability of nature to buffer commu-
nities against disasters such as fires, storms, and floods, 
which disproportionately impacts communities of color 
and indigenous populations; and 
(3) is having far-reaching effects on marine and ter-
restrial wildlife, including by altering habitats, forcing 
changes to migratory patterns, and altering the timing of 
biological events; 
Whereas the decline of natural areas and wildlife in the 
United States follows global patterns, as the Intergovern-
mental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Eco-
system Services found that approximately 1,000,000 
plant and animal species are threatened by extinction 
over the coming decades as a result of land conversion, 
development, climate change, invasive species, pollution, 
and other stressors; 
Whereas nature, like the climate, is nearing a tipping point 
where the continued loss and degradation of the natural 
environment will— 
(1) push many ecosystems and wildlife species past 
the point of no return; 
(2) threaten the health and economic prosperity of 
the United States; and 
(3) increase the costs of natural disasters, for which 
the Federal Government spent about $91,000,000,000 in 
2018;

•HRES 835 IH 
Whereas the existing protections for land, the ocean, and 
wildlife in the United States are not sufficient to prevent 
a further decline of nature in the United States, with— 
(1) only 12 percent of the land area in the United 
States permanently protected, mostly in Alaska and the 
West; and 
(2) only 26 percent of Federal ocean territory per-
manently protected, the vast majority of which is in the 
remote western Pacific Ocean or northwestern Hawaii; 
Whereas the United States has historically demonstrated 
leadership and resolve to protect, conserve, and restore 
the natural environment, including through a network of 
protected areas; 
Whereas that network of protected areas is protected and 
supported by a variety of conservation laws passed at 
other times of crisis; 
Whereas the United States— 
(1) ranks among the top 5 countries in the world for 
the amount of wilderness-quality land and ocean remain-
ing; and 
(2) has the conservation experience and traditions 
necessary to make great strides in the protection of the 
remaining natural areas in the United States for future 
generations; 
Whereas the Federal Government, the private sector, civil so-
ciety, farmers, ranchers, fishing communities, and sports-
men have a history of working together to conserve the 
land and ocean of the United States; 
Whereas the Exclusive Economic Zone of the United States, 
consisting of waters within 200 miles of the coastline— 
(1) covers 4,500,000 square miles;

(2) is 23 percent larger than the landmass of the 
United States; and 
(3) provides a home to various ocean habitats and 
ecosystems, including— 
(A) coral reefs; 
(B) kelp forests; 
(C) mangroves; 
(D) seagrass beds; and 
(E) deep-sea corals; 
Whereas conserving and restoring nature is one of the most 
efficient and cost-effective strategies for fighting climate 
change; 
Whereas, to confront the deterioration of natural systems and 
the loss of biodiversity around the world, and to remain 
below a 1.5 degrees Celsius increase in average global 
temperature, scientists recommend that roughly 1⁄2 of the 
planet be conserved; and 
Whereas, as a step toward achieving that goal, some sci-
entists have recommended that all countries commit to 
conserving and protecting at least 30 percent of the land 
and 30 percent of the ocean in each country by 2030, 
with a long-term goal of conserving 1⁄2 of the planet: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-
1
resentatives that— 
2
(1) given the evidence as of October 2019, the 
3
Federal Government should establish a national goal 
4
of conserving at least 30 percent of the land and 30 
5
percent of the ocean within the territory of the 
6
United States by 2030;

(2) the goal described in paragraph (1) should 
1
be accomplished through an effort that includes the 
2
objectives of— 
3
(A) working with local communities, Indian 
4
Tribes, States, and private landowners to con-
5
serve natural places and resources; 
6
(B) improving access to nature for all peo-
7
ple in the United States, including for commu-
8
nities of color and economically disadvantaged 
9
communities; 
10
(C) sequestering carbon and greenhouse 
11
gas emissions in the land and ocean of the 
12
United States; 
13
(D) increasing public incentives for private 
14
landowners to voluntarily conserve and protect 
15
areas of demonstrated conservation value and 
16
with a high capacity to sequester carbon and 
17
greenhouse gas emissions; 
18
(E) focusing work at a large-landscape 
19
scale that is biologically and ecologically mean-
20
ingful;

(F) preventing extinction by recovering 
22
and restoring animal and plant species;

of ecosystems, restoring degraded ecosystems,

and maintaining ecological functions; and

(H) increasing economic opportunities for

farmers, ranchers, fishermen, and foresters; and 
5
(3) the goal described in paragraph (1) and the 
6
objectives described in paragraph (2) should be ac-
7
complished through an effort that— 
8
(A) makes science the foundation of con-
9
servation decisions by providing communities 
10
access to sound, up-to-date scientific informa-
11
tion about— 
12
(i) the land and waters around those 
13
communities; and 
14
(ii) how the land and waters around 
15
those communities are changing in a 
16
warming world; 
17
(B) respects Tribal sovereignty and the 
18
right to Tribal self-determination so that Amer-
19
ican Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawai-
20
ian communities can fulfill what each views as 
21
priorities for the stewardship of the natural,

cultural, and historic resources of the commu-

traditional land uses and enables land owners

to pass down the working land of those land

owners to the next generation because private 
4
land accounts for approximately 60 percent of

that the areas described in subparagraphs (A)
