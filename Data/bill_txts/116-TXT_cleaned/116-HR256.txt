RESOLUTION 
Recognizing people of African descent and Black Europeans. 
Whereas the 109th Congress passed H. Con. Res. 60 and S. 
Con. Res. 90, recognizing African descendants in Latin 
America and the Caribbean, raising awareness of the rac-
ism and discrimination faced by those communities, and 
leading to numerous public and private sector initiatives 
between the United States and Latin American and Car-
ibbean countries to improve the situation of African de-
scendants; 
Whereas the persistence of racism and discrimination in Eu-
rope similarly necessitates congressional action to raise 
awareness and promote public and private sector initia-
tives to stem this trend; 
Whereas the May 19, 2018, royal wedding of Meghan Markle 
and Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, raised awareness

•HRES 256 IH 
of the long history and situation of African-descent popu-
lations in Europe; 
Whereas the terms ‘‘Afro-European’’, ‘‘African European’’, 
or ‘‘Black European’’ refer to people of African ancestry 
or descent born in, citizens of, or living in Europe; 
Whereas an estimated 15,000,000 to 20,000,000 Black Euro-
peans live in and have long had a presence in Europe, 
forming an influential part of the African diaspora; 
Whereas the story of Black Europeans remains widely untold, 
rendering many of their past and present contributions to 
the political and social life of Europe invisible or forgot-
ten; 
Whereas unlike more contemporary figures, largely unknown 
Blacks have made significant contributions to European 
history and culture, including Spanish poet Juan Latino, 
Italian 
Duke 
Alessandro 
Medici, 
French 
novelist 
Alexandre Dumas, German scholar Anthony William 
Amo, French Composer Le Chevalier de St. George, Brit-
ish abolitionist Oladuah Equiano, and Russian General 
and Governor Abram Hannibal, great-grandfather of 
Russian poet Aleksandr Pushkin; 
Whereas the largest estimated populations of Black Euro-
peans can be found in France (approximately 2,500,000), 
the United Kingdom (approximately 1,500,000), and the 
Netherlands (approximately 500,000), in addition to size-
able populations in Germany, Italy, Portugal, Sweden, 
Norway, Ireland, Russia, Switzerland, Spain, Belgium, 
Denmark, and Austria; 
Whereas the presence of Blacks in Europe can be traced to 
voluntary and forced migration resulting from the geo-
graphical proximity of Europe to Africa and the Middle

East, including the transatlantic slave trade, the coloniza-
tion of Africa and the Caribbean, African and African- 
American military deployments, the movement of refu-
gees and asylum seekers, and educational and other pro-
fessional exchanges; 
Whereas although Black Europeans have made significant 
achievements in and contributions to European society, 
large numbers have and continue to be more likely than 
the general population to experience discrimination and 
be underrepresented in leadership roles in the public and 
private sector as a result of the color of their skin and 
ancestry; 
Whereas racism has long been, and continues to be, a prob-
lem in Europe; 
Whereas, on April 29, 2008, before the Commission on Secu-
rity and Cooperation in Europe, at a hearing entitled 
‘‘The State of (In)visible Black Europe: Race, Rights, 
and Politics’’, Dr. Philomena Essed stated, ‘‘Probably the 
only common European experience among many, if not 
all, Afro-descendants is their exposure to [. . .] racism 
and systemic discrimination, regardless of country, socio- 
economic conditions, gender, age, or level of education.’’; 
Whereas, as early as 1997, the European Commission opinion 
poll entitled ‘‘Racism and Xenophobia in Europe’’ re-
ported a ‘‘worrying level of racism and xenophobia in 
[European Union] member states, with nearly 33% of 
those interviewed openly describing themselves as ‘quite 
racist’ or ‘very racist’.’’; 
Whereas annual reports of the European Union Fundamental 
Rights Agency (EUFRA) and both the 2009 and 2018 
European Union Minorities and Discrimination Survey 
21:41 Mar 26, 2019

•HRES 256 IH 
(EU–MIDIS I and II), the first European Union-wide 
surveys of ethnic minority and immigrant groups’ experi-
ences of discrimination and victimization in everyday life 
in the 28 member states of the European Union, found 
that persons of African descent experience high incidents 
of discriminatory treatment, racist crime, and victimiza-
tion, and lacked an awareness of their rights, often 
underreporting cases of hate crimes and other forms of 
discrimination to law enforcement and human rights 
agencies, and that the situation has not drastically im-
proved in the years between the two reports; 
Whereas, in November 2018, the European Union Funda-
mental Rights Agency (EUFRA) launched ‘‘Being Black 
in the EU: Second European Union Minorities and Dis-
crimination Survey’’, and called for member states to de-
velop specific solutions and guidance to address findings 
that 30 percent of respondents had been racially har-
assed, 5 percent physically attacked, 25 percent discrimi-
nated against at work or when looking for work, up to 
76 percent faced unemployment in some countries, and 
were experiencing high rates of discrimination in housing 
and in the justice system, including profiling by law en-
forcement; 
Whereas the Organization for Security and Cooperation in 
Europe Office for Democratic Institutions and Human 
Rights’ (OSCE/ODIHR) most recent 2017 hate crimes 
report found more than 1,608 racist and xenophobic inci-
dents, including a number targeting Black Europeans, 
while OSCE reports in previous years found a number of 
deaths and violent assaults against people of African ori-
gin, and that persons of African descent are often targets 
of racist and antimigrant violence, especially in Eastern

Europe, yet in many countries hate crimes are under-
reported and, legal assistance and financial support for 
victims while recovering from violent attacks does not 
exist; 
Whereas prejudice and discrimination toward Black Euro-
peans has also been linked to changes in immigration and 
asylum laws as a result of antiterrorism initiatives and 
the growth and mainstreaming of nationalist and anti-im-
migrant political parties and groups, including neo-Nazis 
and skinheads; 
Whereas the Open Society Justice Initiative in an initial 
2009 report, entitled ‘‘Ethnic Profiling in the European 
Union’’, and subsequent reports have found that police 
officers in the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Germany, 
and the Netherlands routinely use racial profiling, includ-
ing targeting African descendants, when deciding whom 
to target for stops, searches, raids, and surveillance, lead-
ing to some of the first Europeanwide grassroots and 
legal efforts to end racial profiling in France, Germany, 
and elsewhere in Europe, and over a decade of pan-Euro-
pean antiracism and empowerment initiatives supported 
by Open Society Foundations; 
Whereas there have been numerous efforts by the public and 
private sector to address racial discrimination and in-
equality in Europe, including the introduction of anti-
discrimination and equality laws that include the legal 
support for special measures or positive (affirmative) ac-
tion, creation of equality bodies, media campaigns, and 
efforts to increase minority political participation, and 
campaigns to end the use of stereotypes and derogatory 
terms to refer to Blacks in everyday language, the media, 
and textbooks;

Whereas these efforts include the United Nations designation 
of 2011 as the International Year for People of African 
Descent and 2015–2024 the International Decade for 
People of African Descent in an effort to strengthen na-
tional actions to ensure that people of African descent 
enjoy economic, cultural, social, civil, and political rights, 
as well as promote a greater knowledge of and respect for 
their diverse heritage and culture; 
Whereas these efforts also include the OSCE Parliamentary 
Assembly’s (PA) adoption of Resolutions: ‘‘A Call for 
OSCE Action to Address Violence and Discrimination’’ in 
2016, ‘‘Addressing Racism and Xenophobia Affecting 
People of African Descent in the OSCE Region’’ in 2012, 
and ‘‘Strengthening Efforts to Combat Racism and Xen-
ophobia and Foster Inclusion’’ in 2011 that included rec-
ognition of the International Year for People of African 
Descent, and calling for the OSCE to implement several 
strategic initiatives to address racial and ethnic discrimi-
nation in the OSCE region; 
Whereas, in 2011, OSCE/ODIHR held its first ‘‘Roundtable 
on the contemporary forms of racism and xenophobia af-
fecting Peoples of African Descent in the OSCE region’’, 
and has since annually hosted antidiscrimination initia-
tives focused on People of African Descent including fo-
cused on hate crimes, women, political participation, 
strengthening civil society, and other issues; 
Whereas these efforts also include transatlantic meetings of 
Black and other diverse legislators held annually at the 
European Parliament in Brussels, Belgium, and in the 
United States Congress in Washington, DC, including 
the April 17–19, 2009, ‘‘Black European Summit: Trans-

Political Leadership Conference worked in partnership 
with the German Marshall Fund, the Department of 
State, and other stakeholders to found the Transatlantic 
Inclusion Leaders Network (TILN) to increase diverse 
representation in policymaking; 
Whereas, in October 2013, European Parliamentarians in 
partnership with the European Network Against Racism 
(ENAR) held ‘‘(In)visible Diversity’’ a series of debates 
in the European Parliament, including a debate entitled, 
‘‘People of African Descent and Black Europeans: Reali-
ties of Afrophobia’’ and in 2015 released the first pan- 
European policy guide reviewing the current situation en-
titled, ‘‘ENAR Anti-Racism in Focus 2 - InvisibleVisible 
Minority: Confronting Afrophobia and Advancing Equal-
ity for People of African Descent and Black Europeans 
in Europe’’; 
Whereas, in January 2017, the European Network Against

peans, including in employment, housing, education, 
health, political participation, criminal justice and other 
sectors’’; 
Whereas, on July 25, 2017, the Council of Europe Commis-
sioner for Human Rights stated, ‘‘The position of Black 
people in Europe needs to be strengthened, irrespective 
of whether it concerns recent migrants from Africa or al-
ready established Black communities [. . .] European 
states must first come to terms with their own past [in-
cluding] publicly acknowledge that slavery, the slave 
trade and colonialism are among the major sources of 
current discrimination against Black people.’’, and rec-
ommended European states implement strategies across 
health, education, justice, employment, and other sectors; 
Whereas, in October 2017, the United Kingdom Prime Min-
ister released the Race Disparity Audit ‘‘examin[ing] how 
people of different backgrounds are treated across areas 
including health, education, employment and the criminal 
justice system’’, which found inequalities in education, 
housing, income and employment, justice, and health be-
tween persons of African and Caribbean background and 
others, and has since published the findings online, ap-
pointed a Special Advisor, created a Race Disparity Advi-
sory Group, and announced 90 million British pounds to 
implement strategies to address disparities found by the

African descent living in Europe and to discuss solutions 
to address the racial discrimination and violence they 
face; 
Whereas Member of the European Parliament Cecile Kyenge 
stated, ‘‘In addition to honouring the history and con-
