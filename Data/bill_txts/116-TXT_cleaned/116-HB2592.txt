A BILL 
To enhance transparency and accountability for online polit-
ical advertisements by requiring those who purchase and 
publish such ads to disclose information about the adver-
tisements to the public, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Honest Ads Act’’.

SEC. 2. PURPOSE. 
1
The purpose of this Act is to enhance the integrity 
2
of American democracy and national security by improving 
3
disclosure requirements for online political advertisements 
4
in order to uphold the United States Supreme Court’s 
5
well-established standard that the electorate bears the 
6
right to be fully informed. 
7
SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
8
Congress makes the following findings: 
9
(1) On April 18, 2019, Special Counsel Robert 
10
Mueller released a report titled ‘‘Report on the In-
11
vestigation into Russian Interference in the 2016 
12
Presidential Election’’ which concluded that ‘‘the 
13
Russian government interfered in the 2016 presi-
14
dential election in sweeping and systemic fashion.’’. 
15
The report details that Russia interfered in the 2016 
16
presidential election principally through two oper-
17
ations: first, through a Russian government spon-
18
sored social media influence campaign, and second, 
19
by Russian intelligence ‘‘computer-intrusion’’ oper-
20
ations against those associated with both presi-
21
dential campaigns. 
22
(2) On September 6, 2017, the Nation’s largest 
23
social media platform disclosed that between June 
24
2015 and May 2017, Russian entities purchased 
25
$100,000 in political advertisements, publishing 
26
06:21 May 16, 2019
H2592
3 
•HR 2592 IH
roughly 3,000 ads linked to fake accounts associated 
1
with the Internet Research Agency, a pro-Kremlin 
2
organization. According to the company, the ads 
3
purchased focused ‘‘on amplifying divisive social and 
4
political messages . . .’’. 
5
(3) In 2002, the Bipartisan Campaign Reform 
6
Act became law, establishing disclosure requirements 
7
for political advertisements distributed from a tele-
8
vision or radio broadcast station or provider of cable 
9
or satellite television. In 2003, the Supreme Court 
10
upheld regulations on electioneering communications 
11
established under the Act, noting that such require-
12
ments ‘‘provide the electorate with information and 
13
insure that the voters are fully informed about the 
14
person or group who is speaking.’’. 
15
(4) According to a study from Borrell Associ-
16
ates, in 2016, $1,415,000,000 was spent on online 
17
advertising, more than quadruple the amount in 
18
2012. 
19
(5) The reach of a few large internet plat-
20
forms—larger than any broadcast, satellite, or cable 
21
provider—has greatly facilitated the scope and effec-
22
tiveness of disinformation campaigns. For instance, 
23
the largest platform has over 210,000,000 American 
24
users—over 160,000,000 of them on a daily basis. 
25
06:21 May 16, 2019
H2592

•HR 2592 IH
By contrast, the largest cable television provider has 
1
22,430,000 subscribers, while the largest satellite 
2
television provider has 21,000,000 subscribers. And 
3
the most-watched television broadcast in U.S. his-
4
tory had 118,000,000 viewers. 
5
(6) The public nature of broadcast television, 
6
radio, and satellite ensures a level of publicity for 
7
any political advertisement. These communications 
8
are accessible to the press, fact-checkers, and polit-
9
ical opponents; this creates strong disincentives for 
10
a candidate to disseminate materially false, inflam-
11
matory, or contradictory messages to the public. So-
12
cial media platforms, in contrast, can target portions 
13
of the electorate with direct, ephemeral advertise-
14
ments often on the basis of private information the 
15
platform has on individuals, enabling political adver-
16
tisements that are contradictory, racially or socially 
17
inflammatory, or materially false. 
18
(7) According to comScore, 2 companies own 8 
19
of the 10 most popular smartphone applications as 
20
of June 2017, including the most popular social 
21
media and email services—which deliver information 
22
and news to users without requiring proactivity by 
23
the user. Those same 2 companies accounted for 99 
24
percent of revenue growth from digital advertising in 
25
06:21 May 16, 2019
H2592
5 
•HR 2592 IH
2016, including 77 percent of gross spending. Sev-
1
enty-nine percent of online Americans—representing 
2
68 percent of all Americans—use the single largest 
3
social network, while 66 percent of these users are 
4
most likely to get their news from that site. 
5
(8) In its 2006 rulemaking, the Federal Elec-
6
tion Commission noted that only 18 percent of all 
7
Americans cited the internet as their leading source 
8
of news about the 2004 Presidential election; by con-
9
trast, the Pew Research Center found that 65 per-
10
cent of Americans identified an internet-based 
11
source as their leading source of information for the 
12
2016 election. 
13
(9) The Federal Election Commission, the inde-
14
pendent Federal agency charged with protecting the 
15
integrity of the Federal campaign finance process by 
16
providing transparency and administering campaign 
17
finance laws, has failed to take action to address on-
18
line political advertisements. 
19
(10) In testimony before the Senate Select 
20
Committee on Intelligence titled, ‘‘Disinformation: A 
21
Primer in Russian Active Measures and Influence 
22
Campaigns,’’ multiple expert witnesses testified that 
23
while the disinformation tactics of foreign adver-
24
saries have not necessarily changed, social media 
25
06:21 May 16, 2019
H2592

•HR 2592 IH
services now provide ‘‘platform[s] practically pur-
1
pose-built for active measures[.]’’ Similarly, as Gen. 
2
(RET) Keith B. Alexander, the former Director of 
3
the National Security Agency, testified, during the 
4
Cold War ‘‘if the Soviet Union sought to manipulate 
5
information flow, it would have to do so principally 
6
through its own propaganda outlets or through ac-
7
tive measures that would generate specific news: 
8
planting of leaflets, inciting of violence, creation of 
9
other false materials and narratives. But the news 
10
itself was hard to manipulate because it would have 
11
required actual control of the organs of media, which 
12
took long-term efforts to penetrate. Today, however, 
13
because the clear majority of the information on so-
14
cial media sites is uncurated and there is a rapid 
15
proliferation of information sources and other sites 
16
that can reinforce information, there is an increasing 
17
likelihood that the information available to average 
18
consumers may be inaccurate (whether intentionally 
19
or otherwise) and may be more easily manipulable 
20
than in prior eras.’’. 
21
(11) Current regulations on political advertise-
22
ments do not provide sufficient transparency to up-
23
hold the public’s right to be fully informed about po-
24
litical advertisements made online.

SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
1
It is the sense of Congress that— 
2
(1) the dramatic increase in digital political ad-
3
vertisements, and the growing centrality of online 
4
platforms in the lives of Americans, requires the 
5
Congress and the Federal Election Commission to 
6
take meaningful action to ensure that laws and reg-
7
ulations provide the accountability and transparency 
8
that is fundamental to our democracy; 
9
(2) free and fair elections require both trans-
10
parency and accountability which give the public a 
11
right to know the true sources of funding for polit-
12
ical advertisements in order to make informed polit-
13
ical choices and hold elected officials accountable; 
14
and 
15
(3) transparency of funding for political adver-
16
tisements is essential to enforce other campaign fi-
17
nance laws, including the prohibition on campaign 
18
spending by foreign nationals.
