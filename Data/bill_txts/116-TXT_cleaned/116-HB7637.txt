SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.

(a) SHORT TITLE.—This Act may be cited as the 
4
‘‘New Executive Workgroup for the White House as an

Iconic Treasure Expressing Honor, Obligation, Unity,

Strength, and Excellence of our Nation Act’’ or the ‘‘New 
1
White House Act’’. 
2
(b) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
3
(1) In 1789, the United States became the 
4
world’s first modern national constitutional republic. 
5
(2) In 1791, the Nation’s first president, 
6
George Washington, selected the site for the White 
7
House, and the cornerstone was laid in 1792, after 
8
a competition design submitted by Irish-born archi-
9
tect James Hoban was chosen. 
10
(3) The security of the White House and the 
11
First Family has always been of utmost importance 
12
to the Nation. 
13
(4) The security needs of the White House have 
14
evolved along with the Nation. As conditions war-
15
ranted, the White House has been modified in order 
16
to meet these evolving needs. 
17
(5) In 1808, the first fence around the White 
18
House was constructed under the oversight of 
19
Thomas Jefferson’s administration. This fence was 
20
constructed of wooden split-rail barriers on three 
21
sides of the grounds and a retaining wall on the 
22
other side which bordered the Potomac River wet-
23
lands.

(6) In the 1930s, the wrought-iron fence of the 
1
19th century was replaced by a steel fence tipped 
2
with tall bronze spears. 
3
(7) The current fence is about 7-feet tall and 
4
there are plans to install a taller one in 2018. 
5
(8) During World War II, security became es-
6
pecially strict. The remaining gaps in the White 
7
House fence were closed and access to the driveways 
8
was restricted. At the same time, the gates to the 
9
White House grounds were reinforced. 
10
(9) In 1983, following a truck-bomb attack on 
11
the U.S. Marine barracks in Lebanon, low concrete 
12
walls were put up around the White House. 
13
(10) With the rise of vehicle traffic in Wash-
14
ington DC, bollards—sturdy, vertical posts—were 
15
added to prevent security breaches by automobiles. 
16
(11) In 1950, an assassination attempt on 
17
President Harry S. Truman further raised concerns 
18
over the safety of the President. 
19
(12) In the 20th century, there were numerous 
20
instances of the White House perimeter being 
21
breached by those who wished to reach the Presi-
22
dent. 
23
(13) On April 13, 1912, Michael Winter made 
24
it several feet inside the front door of the White

House before being stopped by staff. This was his 
1
second attempt to reach President William Howard 
2
Taft. 
3
(14) On September 26, 1963, Doyle Allen 
4
Hicks rammed his pickup truck through the White 
5
House gates and drove 25 feet into the North Por-
6
tico main entrance. He intended to reach President 
7
John F. Kennedy. 
8
(15) On February 17, 1974, Robert K. Preston, 
9
an Army private, stole a helicopter from Fort 
10
Meade, Maryland. He hovered over the Washington 
11
Monument and the White House grounds before 
12
leading two State police helicopters on an aerial 
13
chase around Maryland and Washington, DC. Pres-
14
ton then returned to the White House and officers 
15
were forced to shoot at the helicopter. Preston was 
16
upset about flunking out of flight school. 
17
(16) On February 22, 1974, Samuel Joseph 
18
Byck tried to hijack a Delta passenger jet at Balti-
19
more-Washington International Airport. His inten-
20
tion was to crash the jet into the White House. He 
21
forced his way onto the plane and killed an airport 
22
policeman and the copilot before being shot by po-
23
lice.

(17) On December 25, 1974, Marshall Fields 
1
crashed his automobile through the Northwest Gate 
2
of the White House and drove close to the North 
3
Portico. He threatened to detonate explosives which 
4
he had strapped to his body. Fields surrendered to 
5
officials after hours of negotiation. 
6
(18) In October 1978, Anthony Henry scaled 
7
the White House fence while wielding a knife. He 
8
slashed two officers before White House guards were 
9
able to subdue him. He intended to find President 
10
Jimmy Carter. 
11
(19) On September 12, 1994, Frank Eugene 
12
Corder stole a Cessna plane and entered the prohib-
13
ited airspace around the White House. He crashed 
14

15
(20) On October 29, 1994, Francisco Martin 
16
Duran, armed with a semiautomatic rifle, fired over 
17
29 rounds at the White House from the sidewalk on 
18
Pennsylvania Avenue. He intended to kill President 
19
Bill Clinton. 
20
(21) On May 23, 1995, Leland W. Modjeski 
21
climbed over the White House fence and ran towards 
22
the White House with a handgun. He was shot by 
23
the Secret Service.

1
W. Bush was taken to an undisclosed location due 
2
to security concerns at the White House following 
3
attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pen-
4
tagon. 
5
(23) A 2015 House of Representatives report 
6
showed that there were 104 attempted breaches of 
7
White House security between April 2005 and April 
8
2015. 
9
(24) On November 11, 2011, Oscar Ramiro Or-
10
tega-Hernandez fired an assault rifle at the White 
11
House. He hit the residential wing of the building at 
12
least seven times. This attack was not immediately 
13
detected and Ortega-Hernandez was not found and 
14
arrested for 5 days. 
15
(25) On January 26, 2015, the Secret Service 
16
was forced to lock down the White House due to a 
17
drone flying above the White House grounds. The 
18
drone crashed on the Southeast side of the complex. 
19
(26) On November 26, 2015, a man draped in 
20
an American flag jumped the White House fence 
21
during a Thanksgiving celebration at the Executive 
22
