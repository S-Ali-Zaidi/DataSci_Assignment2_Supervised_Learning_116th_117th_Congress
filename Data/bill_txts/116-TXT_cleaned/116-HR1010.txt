RESOLUTION 
Commemorating Juneteenth by calling for the implementa-
tion of safeguards to protect the integrity of United 
States elections and end voter suppression.

criminate, hinder, and prohibit the rights of Americans to 
vote are prevalent;

Whereas voter suppression laws disproportionately impact 
historically marginalized people, including persons of 
color, low income persons, and elderly persons; 
Whereas these laws especially target and disenfranchise mi-
norities and people of color in African-American and 
Latino communities, among other demographics; 
Whereas as we celebrate the anniversary of Juneteenth, 
which marked the ending of slavery 155 years ago, we 
must protect the constitutional right of African Ameri-
cans and other minorities to vote; 
Whereas the fear of reverting back to the time of Jim Crow 
voting restrictions and the complete suppression of mi-
norities at the polls can be fought by investing in our de-
mocracy; 
Whereas the recent primary elections in States such as Wis-
consin, Washington, Georgia, and South Carolina exposed 
many flaws in our electoral system that undermines the 
sacred right to vote in the United States; 
Whereas the active threats posed by the emergence of 
COVID–19 have created new challenges and barriers re-
lating to access to the ballot box for voters; 
Whereas additional investments in new technology and im-
proved election systems are crucial to the health of our 
democratic institutions and the administration of fair 
elections; and 
Whereas more work must be done to remove oppressive vot-
ing laws and increase access to the polls to ensure that 
all Americans have the right to vote in the midst of the 
global health threats posed by COVID–19: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
