RESOLUTION 
Recognizing January 2019 as ‘‘National Mentoring Month’’, 
and for other purposes. 
Whereas the goals of National Mentoring Month are to raise 
awareness of youth mentoring, recruit individuals to men-
tor, celebrate the powerful impact of real life mentoring 
relationships that form and thrive each day because of 
the caring adults who volunteer their time for young peo-
ple, and encourage mentoring organizations to engage 
and integrate quality mentoring into their efforts, and 
thank the mentors who made us who we are today; 
Whereas many young people across the Nation make every-
day choices that lead up to life’s big decisions without 
guidance and support;

Whereas mentoring relationships provide powerful tools for 
connection and are critical for our Nation’s future; 
Whereas a mentor is a caring, consistent presence who de-
votes time to help a young person discover personal 
strength and achieve his or her potential; 
Whereas quality mentoring supports positive life and social 
skills, promotes self-esteem, bolsters academic achieve-
ment and college access, and nurtures young leadership 
development; 
Whereas mentoring relationships are a shared opportunity for 
learning and growth, positively impacting both the men-
tor and the mentee; 
Whereas, mentoring programs are run by many different or-
ganizations and agencies with different goals for young 
people. Seventy-nine percent of programs are nonprofits, 
9 percent are K12 schools or districts, 3 percent are gov-
ernment agencies, 3 percent are higher education institu-
tions, and the remaining 6 percent are religious institu-
tions, for-profits, healthcare facilities, and others; 
Whereas mentoring programs have been shown to be effective 
in helping young people make healthy choices, and youth 
who meet regularly with their mentors are 46 percent 
less likely than their peers to start using illegal drugs; 
Whereas research shows that young people who were at risk 
for not completing high school but who had mentors were 
55 percent more likely to be enrolled in college, 81 per-
cent more likely to report participating regularly in 
sports or extracurricular activities, more than twice as 
likely to say they held a leadership position in a club or 
sports team, and 78 percent more likely to pay it forward 
by volunteering regularly in their communities, and that

90 percent are now interested in becoming mentors them-
selves; 
Whereas mentoring can play a role in helping young people 
attend school regularly, as research shows that students 
who meet regularly with their mentors are 52 percent 
less likely than their peers to skip a day of school and 
37 percent less likely to skip a class; 
Whereas mentors prepare young people for professional ca-
reers by helping them set career goals, introducing them 
to industry professionals, and helping them train for and 
find jobs; 
Whereas all of the above listed benefits link youth to eco-
nomic and social capital while also strengthening commu-
nities; and 
Whereas despite these benefits, 9 million young people in the 
United States feel isolated from meaningful connections 
with adults outside their homes, constituting a ‘‘men-
toring gap’’ that demonstrates a need for collaboration 
and resources: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
