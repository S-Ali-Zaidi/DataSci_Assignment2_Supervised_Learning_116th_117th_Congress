To protect and educate children about the dangers of e- 
cigarettes and other electronic nicotine delivery systems, 
and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Smoke-Free Schools 
4
Act of 2019’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) The use of tobacco among young students 
8
remains a serious health concern, with more than 1 
9
in every 4 high school students, and approximately 
10

1 in every 14 middle school students, reporting re-
1
cently using a tobacco product. 
2
(2) Roughly 95 percent of smokers will start 
3
smoking before they are 21 years of age, with more 
4
than 90 percent of adult smokers reporting having 
5
started when they were teens. 
6
(3) E-cigarettes and other electronic nicotine 
7
delivery systems (commonly referred to as ‘‘ENDS’’) 
8
entered the market in 2006 and, by 2014, became 
9
the most commonly used and popular tobacco prod-
10
ucts among middle school and high school students. 
11
(4) The use of electronic nicotine delivery sys-
12
tems, including e-cigarettes, continues to rise, with 
13
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and 
14
the Food and Drug Administration having recorded 
15
a 78 percent increase in e-cigarette use among high 
16
school students and 48 percent increase in e-ciga-
17
rette use among middle school students from 2017 
18
to 2018. 
19
(5) The most recent data finds that 3,620,000 
20
middle school and high school students were current 
21
e-cigarette users in 2018, an increase of 1,500,000 
22
students in just one year. 
23
(6) Despite a 2018 National Academies of 
24
Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine report that 
25

•HR 4019 IH
found e-cigarette aerosol contained fewer toxicants 
1
than combusted cigarette smoke, e-cigarettes present 
2
unique health concerns for middle school and high 
3
school students. 
4
(7) Electronic nicotine delivery systems, includ-
5
ing e-cigarettes, can contain nicotine, a drug the 
6
Surgeon General has determined is highly addictive 
7
and can be harmful to the development of the ado-
8
lescent brain. 
9
(8) Congress has a major policy-setting role in 
10
ensuring that the use of tobacco products among mi-
11
nors is discouraged to the maximum extent possible. 
12
(9) Additionally, local educational agencies 
13
should be given greater flexibility to target specific 
14
funding to efforts aimed at eradicating the problem 
15
of the use of electronic nicotine delivery systems, in-
16
cluding e-cigarettes, as such use affects student 
17
health, productivity, safety, and outcomes and im-
18
pedes a distraction-free learning environment.
