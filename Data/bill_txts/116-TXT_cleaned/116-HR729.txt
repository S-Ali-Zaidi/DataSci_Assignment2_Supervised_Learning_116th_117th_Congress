RESOLUTION 
Encouraging the President to expand the list of the Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs of presumptive medical condi-
tions associated with exposure to Agent Orange to in-
clude Parkinsonism, bladder cancer, hypertension, and

tion of the United States; 
Whereas veterans and their families deserve the benefits that 
they have earned;

Whereas members of the Armed Forces sprayed millions of 
gallons of Agent Orange, a tactical herbicide, and other 
tactical herbicides on trees and vegetation during the 
Vietnam War, from 1962 to 1975; 
Whereas 58,220 members of the Armed Forces died in com-
bat during the Vietnam War, and veterans are still dying 
from diseases related to exposure to Agent Orange; 
Whereas approximately 83,000 veterans are currently living 
with at least one of the presumptive medical conditions 
associated with exposure to Agent Orange; 
Whereas the report set forth by the National Academy of 
Medicine in 2018 entitled ‘‘Veterans and Agent Orange 
Exposure: Update 11’’ recognized— 
(1) hypothyroidism and bladder cancer to have a 
limited or suggestive evidence of association to exposure 
to Agent Orange; and 
(2) 
Parkinson-like 
symptoms, 
also 
known 
as 
Parkinsonism, and hypertension to have sufficient evi-
dence of association to exposure to Agent Orange; 
Whereas, due to exposure to Agent Orange, veterans and 
their families are facing monumental hurdles with respect 
to financial stress, mental health, substance addiction, 
and physical health issues; and 
Whereas internal documents obtained by a veteran under sec-
tion 552 of title 5, United States Code (commonly re-
ferred to as the ‘‘Freedom of Information Act’’), deter-
mined that the Director of the Office of Management and 
Budget and other White House officials objected to the 
recommendation by former Secretary of Veterans Affairs 
David Shulkin to add bladder cancer, Parkinsonism, and
