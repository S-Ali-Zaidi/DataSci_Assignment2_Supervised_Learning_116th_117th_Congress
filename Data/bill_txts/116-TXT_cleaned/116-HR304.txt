Whereas in truth and fact, attorney for Michael Cohen, Mi-
chael Monico, admitted in a March 12, 2019, letter that 
Cohen’s testimony was inaccurate; 
Whereas in truth and fact, the ex post representation by 
Cohen’s attorney does not annul Cohen’s intentionally 
false and misleading testimony; 
Whereas in truth and fact, Cohen’s testimony under oath was 
delivered in the context of apologizing for all his criminal 
activities; 
Whereas in truth and fact, Cohen’s denial of ever seeking a 
pardon contained no qualifiers about the context of his 
statement; 
Whereas in truth and fact, Cohen’s denial of ever seeking a 
pardon, as uttered under oath in his testimony, was abso-
lute and unequivocal; 
Whereas in truth and fact, Cohen testified under oath that 
he and his lawyers spent hours editing his written state-
ment submitted to the Committee on Oversight and Re-
form preceding his testimony, which included the written 
assertion, ‘‘I have never asked for, nor would I accept, 
a pardon from President Trump’’; 
Whereas in truth and fact, Cohen’s denial in his written 
statement of never asking for a Presidential pardon was 
an unqualified assertion; 
Whereas Michael Cohen falsely testified under oath that he 
‘‘did not want to go to the White House’’ and he ‘‘did 
not want a role or title in the administration’’; 
Whereas in truth and fact the United States Attorney’s Of-

plaining: ‘‘during and after the campaign, Cohen pri-
vately told friends and colleagues, including in seized text 
messages, that he expected to be given a prominent role 
and title in the new administration. When that did not 
materialize, Cohen found a way to monetize his relation-
ship with and access to the President’’; 
Whereas Michael Cohen falsely testified under oath on other 
factual matters of material significance; 
Whereas Michael Cohen’s intentionally false testimony was 
aimed at obscuring the truth and ameliorating the extent 
of his own personal embarrassment; 
Whereas intentionally false testimony to a Committee of the 
House of Representatives harms the integrity of the pro-
ceedings of the House; 
Whereas it is a Federal crime to provide false information to 
Congress and the failure to enforce this crime further un-
dermines the integrity of the House; and 
Whereas it is the judgment of the House of Representatives 
that providing a copy of the official transcript of the 
hearing of the Committee on Oversight and Reform on 
February 27, 2019, to the Department of Justice would 
aid the Attorney General’s consideration of investigation 
and potential prosecution of Michael Cohen’s criminal 
conduct: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives directs 
1
the Chair of the Oversight and Reform Committee to sub-
2
mit to the Attorney General an official copy of the tran-

script of the hearing during which Michael Cohen testified

under oath on February 27, 2019.
