•HR 3110 IH
(1) The evidence for human-induced climate 
1
change is clear and undeniable. 
2
(2) According to the 2019 Worldwide Threat 
3
Assessment of the U.S. Intelligence Community, cli-
4
mate change will fuel competition for resources, and 
5
cause economic distress and social discontent 
6
through 2019 and beyond. 
7
(3) In 2016, the National Intelligence Council 
8
found that ‘‘climate change and its resulting effects 
9
are likely to pose wide-ranging national security 
10
challenges for the United States and other countries 
11
over the next 20 years.’’. 
12
(4) The intelligence community, the Depart-
13
ment of Defense, the Department of State, inter-
14
national organizations, and national security experts 
15
have all concluded that the impacts of climate 
16
change pose a significant risk to the national secu-
17
rity of the United States. 
18
(5) The impacts of climate change— 
19
(A) threaten the national security infra-
20
structure of the United States both domestically 
21
and abroad; 
22
(B) negatively impact the readiness and 
23
operations of the Armed Forces; and

(C) contribute to the conditions that lead 
1
to subnational, national, regional, and global in-
2
stability. 
3
(6) The intelligence community has previously 
4
analyzed, studied, and engaged in public-private 
5
partnerships to improve understanding about the ef-
6
fects of climate change on national security, how-
7
ever, such efforts were undertaken in a sporadic 
8
manner due to inconsistent policy commitment to 
9
such efforts. 
10
(7) The United States needs to be fully pre-
11
pared to respond to the threats to and harmful im-
12
pacts on national security from climate change, but 
13
is not at the present time.
