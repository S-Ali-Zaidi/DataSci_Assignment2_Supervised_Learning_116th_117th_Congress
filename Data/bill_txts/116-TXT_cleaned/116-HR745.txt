Whereas India’s Constitution mandates a secular state that 
upholds the rights of all citizens to the freedoms of reli-
gion, expression, and speech and to equal treatment be-
fore the law; 
Whereas international human rights law holds that all people 
have the right to freedom of opinion and expression, in-
cluding freedom to practice, worship, or observe one’s 
own religion; 
Whereas, since 1989, Jammu and Kashmir has been the site 
of a 30-year conflict between the Indian government, 
local Kashmiris, and militants, that has claimed tens of 
thousands of lives, exacerbated by disenfranchisement of 
the local population and external state support for the in-
surgency; 
Whereas, on February 14, 2019, an Indian national and 
member of a Pakistan-based, United States-designated 
foreign terrorist organization conducted the deadliest ter-
rorist attack against Indian forces since 1989, killing 40 
security personnel; 
Whereas, on August 5, 2019, the Government of India cut 
all telephone service and internet access in Jammu and 
Kashmir, the 53rd time the Indian government restricted 
communication in Kashmir in 2019; 
Whereas the Government of India has stated that commu-
nications restrictions are required to stop terrorists from 
communicating with one another; 
Whereas the Government of India announced it had restored 
landline phone service to Jammu and Kashmir on Sep-
tember 5, 2019, and partially restored cellphone service

Whereas 60 percent of the 6,000,000 mobile subscribers in 
Jammu and Kashmir rely on prepaid cellphones, which 
remain inoperable for communication, and text messaging 
and mobile internet services remain suspended; 
Whereas people across the United States maintain ties with 
family and friends in Jammu and Kashmir and have re-
ported difficulty contacting their loved ones since the 
communications blockade was imposed on August 5, 
2019; 
Whereas press accounts and human rights observers have 
documented that the communications restrictions derailed 
health services in Jammu and Kashmir, with patients re-
porting difficulty calling ambulances and hospitals, and 
physicians reporting difficulty accessing critical medicines 
for advanced stages of disease; 
Whereas the Committee to Protect Journalists, Reporters 
Without Borders, Reporters Committee for Freedom of 
the Press, and independent reporters have documented 
detentions and harassment of journalists in Jammu and 
Kashmir; 
Whereas the Government of India has barred senior United 
States Government officials and foreign journalists from 
traveling to Jammu and Kashmir since August 5, 2019; 
Whereas international human rights observers have docu-
mented the police’s use of excessive force against de-
tained people and excessive and indiscriminate use of pel-
let shotguns, tear gas, and rubber bullets against pro-
testers; 
Whereas data from the Government of India found that more 
than 3,800 people in Jammu and Kashmir were arrested 
between August 5 and September 6, 2019, 2,600 had

been released from detention, and prominent political and 
business leaders remain in detention; 
Whereas the Jammu and Kashmir police have acknowledged 
that 144 children, as young as 9 years old, have been ar-
rested; 
Whereas Indian authorities have used the Public Safety Act 
to preventatively detain people for a broad range of ac-
tivities that are vaguely defined and without charge for 
up to 2 years in some cases, including human rights de-
fenders, journalists, political leaders, and people involved 
in protests; 
Whereas India’s Public Safety Act violates article 9(2) of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights by 
allowing authorities to not communicate grounds of de-
tention for up to 10 days of detention, and also to with-
hold any information considered ‘‘to be against the public 
interest to disclose’’; 
Whereas photographic evidence indicates that detained people 
have been required to sign surety bonds forbidding them 
from making statements or participating in political ac-
tivities as a condition of their release; and 
Whereas the Department of State reports that the security 
situation in Jammu and Kashmir remains dire, with in-
surgents and terrorists threatening the lives of civilians, 
armed forces, police, and government officials: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
