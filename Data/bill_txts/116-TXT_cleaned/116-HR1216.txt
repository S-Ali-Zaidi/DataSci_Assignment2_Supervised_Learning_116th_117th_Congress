RESOLUTION 
Supporting the #EndSARS peaceful protest movement in 
Nigeria. 
Whereas, on October 20, 2020, armed security forces report-
edly indiscriminately fired live ammunition on a crowd of 
peaceful protestors that had gathered at the Lekki toll-
gate in Lagos, Nigeria, resulting in numerous deaths and 
injuries, in an event now known as ‘‘Black Tuesday’’; 
Whereas, on October 3, 2020, a widely shared video emerged 
appearing to show footage of the brutal murder and rob-
bery of a Nigerian civilian by officers of the Federal Spe-
cial Anti-Robbery Squad, commonly known as ‘‘SARS’’; 
Whereas since the emergence of this footage, thousands of 
people across Nigeria have been publicly and peacefully

demonstrating against police brutality and demanding the 
complete disbandment of SARS; 
Whereas the #EndSARS protest movement in Nigeria has 
been peacefully calling for the disbandment of SARS, 
which has been implicated in widespread human rights 
abuses, including torture and extrajudicial killings; 
Whereas there has been significant evidence of police violence 
and abuse by SARS in Nigeria, which must be thor-
oughly and immediately investigated in order to achieve 
justice for victims; 
Whereas all peaceful protestors who were wrongfully arrested 
for participating or supporting the #EndSARS protests 
must immediately be released; 
Whereas there must be an immediate independent investiga-
tion of the actions that led to the killing of and the use 
of deadly force against protestors at the Lekki tollgate on 
October 20, 2020; 
Whereas justice for the victims—and their families—killed by 
Nigerian security forces during peaceful demonstrations 
against police abuse must be addressed; 
Whereas comprehensive reform of the security sector, includ-
ing specific measures of accountability, should be imme-
diately initiated and implemented in a public and trans-
parent manner; 
Whereas the Nigerian Government must uphold the right to 
peaceful protest and assembly in accordance with the 
International Bill of Rights, the African Charter on 
Human and Peoples’ Rights, and the Constitution of the 
Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended);
