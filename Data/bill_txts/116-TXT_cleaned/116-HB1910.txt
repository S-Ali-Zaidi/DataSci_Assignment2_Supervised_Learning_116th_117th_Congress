A BILL 
To abolish the Export-Import Bank of the United States, 
and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Export-Import Bank 
4
Termination Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
The Congress finds as follows: 
7
(1) Export subsidies provide advantages to spe-
8
cific industries or businesses at the expense of their 
9

•HR 1910 IH
domestic competition, other sectors of the United 
1
States economy, and the public at large. 
2
(2) Banks and other financial institutions that 
3
provide trade facilitation credit also profit from ex-
4
port subsidies such as loan guarantees and trade in-
5
surance. 
6
(3) International trade finance is well developed 
7
and supplied by the private sector at competitive 
8
rates that reflect market conditions. 
9
(4) The Export-Import Bank of the United 
10
States is an agency of the United States Govern-
11
ment that subsidizes exports by insuring or guaran-
12
teeing trade facilitation loans and other credit from 
13
private financial institutions and by providing direct 
14
loans to United States exporters. 
15
(5) Export subsidies impose risks on United 
16
States taxpayers. In a June 2012 paper using accu-
17
rate, fair value estimation, the Congressional Budget 
18
Office found that the expected return of the Export- 
19
Import Bank of the United States was less than a 
20
tenth of the estimate under the current, flawed 
21
methodology used pursuant to the Federal Credit 
22
Reform Act of 1990. 
23
(6) In recent years, other ‘‘safe’’ Federal credit 
24
programs have been shown to create significant risk 
25
18:32 Apr 09, 2019
H1910
3 
•HR 1910 IH
for taxpayers, for example, Fannie Mae, Freddie 
1
Mac, and the Federal Housing Administration. 
2
(7) The Export-Import Bank of the United 
3
States claims to serve small businesses primarily, 
4
but most of its financing subsidizes exports of large 
5
multinational corporations.
