This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Fixing Global Free-

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) International government price controls of 
6
pharmaceutical products and services creates an un-
7
fair playing field because the rest of the world relies 
8
on and benefits from the biopharmaceutical innova-
9
tion that takes place in the United States, which 
10
supports 4.5 million jobs and amounts to $90 billion 
11
in research and development investment every year. 
12
(2) The United States pays the cost of devel-
13
oping innovative and life-saving prescription drugs 
14
while other countries refuse to pay their fair share 
15
for their health care needs. 
16
(3) In fact, some of the United States trading 
17
partners are ignoring obligations established under 
18
trade agreements and setting up discriminatory 
19
rules to benefit local competitors over United States 
20
companies. 
21
(4) Between 2010 and 2011, 23 countries im-
22
plemented 89 distinct measures to contain govern-
23
ment spending on prescription drugs. Most used 
24
their single-payer healthcare systems to impose drug 
25
price controls alongside increased copayments, value-

added tax rates on prescription drugs, and other 
1
measures. 
2
(5) Studies have shown that government price 
3
controls result in prices below actual market value 
4
and push the burden of paying for innovative treat-
5
ments on to United States patients.
