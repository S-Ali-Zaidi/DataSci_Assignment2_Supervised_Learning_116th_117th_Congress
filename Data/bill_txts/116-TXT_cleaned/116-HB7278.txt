This title may be cited as the ‘‘Justice for Victims 
13
of Lynching Act of 2020’’. 
14
SEC. 402. FINDINGS. 
15
Congress finds the following: 
16
(1) The crime of lynching succeeded slavery as 
17
the ultimate expression of racism in the United 
18
States following Reconstruction. 
19
(2) Lynching was a widely acknowledged prac-
20
tice in the United States until the middle of the 
21
20th century. 
22
(3) Lynching was a crime that occurred 
23
throughout the United States, with documented inci-
24
dents in all but 4 States.

03:34 Jul 21, 2020

45 
•HR 7278 IH
(4) At least 4,742 people, predominantly Afri-
1
can Americans, were reported lynched in the United 
2
States between 1882 and 1968. 
3
(5) Ninety-nine percent of all perpetrators of 
4
lynching escaped from punishment by State or local 
5
officials. 
6
(6) Lynching prompted African Americans to 
7
form the National Association for the Advancement 
8
of Colored People (referred to in this section as the 
9
‘‘NAACP’’) and prompted members of B’nai B’rith 
10
to found the Anti-Defamation League. 
11
(7) Mr. Walter White, as a member of the 
12
NAACP and later as the executive secretary of the 
13
NAACP from 1931 to 1955, meticulously inves-
14
tigated lynchings in the United States and worked 
15
tirelessly to end segregation and racialized terror. 
16
(8) Nearly 200 anti-lynching bills were intro-
17
duced in Congress during the first half of the 20th 
18
century. 
19
(9) Between 1890 and 1952, 7 Presidents peti-
20
tioned Congress to end lynching. 
21
(10) Between 1920 and 1940, the House of 
22
Representatives passed 3 strong anti-lynching meas-
23
ures.

(11) Protection against lynching was the min-
1
imum and most basic of Federal responsibilities, and 
2
the Senate considered but failed to enact anti-lynch-
3
ing legislation despite repeated requests by civil 
4
rights groups, Presidents, and the House of Rep-
5
resentatives to do so. 
6
(12) The publication of ‘‘Without Sanctuary: 
7
Lynching Photography in America’’ helped bring 
8
greater awareness and proper recognition of the vic-
9
tims of lynching. 
10
(13) Only by coming to terms with history can 
11
the United States effectively champion human rights 
12
abroad. 
13
(14) An apology offered in the spirit of true re-
14
pentance moves the United States toward reconcili-
15
ation and may become central to a new under-
16
standing, on which improved racial relations can be 
17
forged. 
18
(15) Having concluded that a reckoning with 
19
our own history is the only way the country can ef-
20
fectively champion human rights abroad, 90 Mem-
21
bers of the United States Senate agreed to Senate 
22
Resolution 39, 109th Congress, on June 13, 2005, 
23
to apologize to the victims of lynching and the de-

scendants of those victims for the failure of the Sen-
1
ate to enact anti-lynching legislation. 
2
(16) The National Memorial for Peace and Jus-
3
tice, which opened to the public in Montgomery, Ala-
4
bama, on April 26, 2018, is the Nation’s first memo-
5
rial dedicated to the legacy of enslaved Black people, 
6
people terrorized by lynching, African Americans hu-
7
miliated by racial segregation and Jim Crow, and 
8
people of color burdened with contemporary pre-
9
sumptions of guilt and police violence. 
10
(17) Notwithstanding the Senate’s apology and 
11
the heightened awareness and education about the 
12
Nation’s legacy with lynching, it is wholly necessary 
13
and appropriate for the Congress to enact legisla-
14
tion, after 100 years of unsuccessful legislative ef-
15
forts, finally to make lynching a Federal crime. 
16
(18) Further, it is the sense of Congress that 
17
criminal action by a group increases the likelihood 
18
that the criminal object of that group will be suc-
19
cessfully attained and decreases the probability that 
20
the individuals involved will depart from their path 
21
of criminality. Therefore, it is appropriate to specify 
22
criminal penalties for the crime of lynching, or any 
23
attempt or conspiracy to commit lynching.

2
(21) Senate Joint Resolution 49 (Public Law 
3
115–58; 131 Stat. 1149) specifically took notice of 
4
‘‘hundreds of torch-bearing White nationalists, 
5
White supremacists, Klansmen, and neo-Nazis [who] 
6
chanted racist, anti-Semitic, and anti-immigrant slo-

12
where are concerned about the growing and open 
13

15
(22) Lynching was a pernicious and pervasive 
16
tool that was used to interfere with multiple aspects 
17
of life—including the exercise of federally protected 
18
rights, as enumerated in section 245 of title 18, 
19

20

22
enumerated in section 247 of title 18, United States
