SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress makes the following findings: 
2
(1) The People’s Republic of China has dra-
3
matically increased engagement with Latin America 
4
and the Caribbean since 2004. Latin America is the 
5
second largest destination for Chinese foreign direct 
6
investment. China has become the top trading part-
7
ner of Brazil, Chile, Peru, and Uruguay. China’s 
8
trade 
with 
Latin 
America 
has 
grown 
from 
9
$17,000,000,000 in 2002 to $306,000,000,000 in 
10
2018. 
11
(2) Between 2005 and 2018, the People’s Re-
12
public of China provided Latin America with an esti-
13
mated $141,000,000,000 in development loans and 
14
other assistance. The annual amount of such loans 
15
and assistance consistently surpasses the annual sov-
16
ereign lending to Latin America and the Caribbean 
17
from either the World Bank or the Inter-American 
18
Development Bank. 
19
(3) The People’s Republic of China— 
20
(A) is investing extensively across the re-
21
gion’s extractive sector and agricultural supply 
22

chains to more effectively control raw materials 
1
supply and pricing; 
2
(B) has acquired and built new port facili-
3
ties and other transport and energy infrastruc-
4
ture in Brazil, Panama, Costa Rica, El Sal-
5
vador, and elsewhere in the region to expand its 
6
footprint in Latin America; and 
7
(C) has developed strong partnerships and 
8
engaged in extensive deal-making in tele-
9
communications and other technology-intensive 
10
sectors in the Latin American and Caribbean 
11
region. 
12
(4) In 2015, the People’s Republic of China 
13
and countries of the Community of Latin American 
14
and Caribbean States (CELAC) held the first meet-
15
ing of the China-CELAC Ministerial Forum, at 
16
which they agreed to a 5-year cooperation plan re-
17
garding politics, security, trade, investment, finance, 
18
infrastructure, energy, resources, industry, agri-
19
culture, science, and people-to-people exchanges. 
20
China is also active in other regional institutions, in-
21
cluding multilateral development banks. 
22
(5) The United States Southern Command has 
23
warned that China’s space and telecommunications 
24
ventures in Latin America and the Caribbean have 
25

created United States commercial and security 
1
vulnerabilities. 
2
(6) 
China 
has 
spent 
more 
than 
3
$244,000,000,000 on energy projects worldwide 
4
since 2000, 25 percent of which was spent in Latin 
5
America and the Caribbean. Although the majority 
6
of this spending was for oil, gas, and coal, China has 
7
also been the largest investor in clean energy glob-
8
ally for almost a decade. 
9
(7) China promotes the repressive use of tech-
10
nology— 
11
(A) by selling crowd control weapons and 
12
riot gear used against demonstrators; and 
13
(B) by developing tracking systems that 
14
can be used by governments to surveil and mon-
15
itor their citizens. 
16
(8) Although China did not originally include 
17
the Latin America and Caribbean region in its Belt 
18
and Road Initiative— 
19
(A) at a meeting with the Community of 
20
Latin American and Caribbean States in Janu-
21
ary 2018, China invited Latin America and the 
22
Caribbean to participate in the Belt and Road 
23
Initiative, referring to the region as a natural 
24
fit for a program that aims to improve

connectivity between land and sea through 
1
jointly built logistic, electricity and information 
2
pathways; and 
3
(B) Nineteen Latin American and Carib-
4
bean countries have signed bilateral Belt and 
5
Road Cooperation Agreements since 2017. 
6
(9) The People’s Republic of China offers to fi-
7
nance projects in Latin America and the Caribbean 
8
on deceptively easy terms that frequently lead recipi-
9
ent countries to become dependent on, and deeply 
10
indebted to, China. Chinese companies frequently 
11
engage in exploitative practices, including predatory 
12
lending, and project requirements that— 
13
(A) provide little or no benefit to the host 
14
country; and 
15
(B) facilitate corrupt practices. 
16
(10) The Government of China expects that 
17
Chinese companies will invest the equivalent of 
18
$250,000,000,000 in Latin America and the Carib-
19
bean by 2025. 
20
(11) Since 2017, China has used its increasing 
21
economic influence in Latin America and the Carib-
22
bean to encourage countries, including El Salvador, 
23
Panama, and the Dominican Republic, to sever dip-
24
lomatic relations with Taiwan. Of the 15 countries

Belize, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua, 
3
Paraguay, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, and St.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
6
It is the sense of Congress that— 
7
(1) the United States shares extensive economic 
8
and commercial relations, democratic values, cultural 
9
ties, and geographic proximity with the nations of 
10
the Western Hemisphere; 
11
(2) increased United States engagement with 
12
countries in the Western Hemisphere is essential to 
13
addressing initiatives by rival powers, such as China, 
14
to increase their presence and influence over govern-
15
ments in Latin American and the Caribbean at the 
16
expense of strategic economic and security interests 
17
of the United States; 
18
(3) the United States is uniquely positioned to 
19
promote the rule of law and support the strength-
20
ening of democratic institutions and individual free-
21
doms in Latin America and the Caribbean, while im-
22
proving the quality of life of citizens throughout the 
23
Western Hemisphere;

(4) China’s growing presence in the Western 
1
Hemisphere— 
2
(A) has contributed to the survival of auto-
3
cratic and anti-democratic regimes, such as the 
4
Maduro regime and the Government of Cuba, 
5
by acting as a lender of last resort and pro-
6
viding other forms of economic support; 
7
(B) has assisted such regimes in under-
8
mining democratic norms through weapons 
9
sales and the proliferation of surveillance tech-
10
nology; and 
11
(C) has provided governments with the re-
12
sources to implement irresponsible economic 
13
policies to the detriment of its citizens; and 
14
(5) the United States Government should con-
15
tinue to assert a positive presence in the Western 
16
Hemisphere based upon— 
17
(A) supporting the rule of law, combating 
18
corruption, and advancing digital security as a 
19
means to improve prospects for regional growth 
20
and development and mitigate the unfair advan-

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following find-
8
ings: 
9
(1) According to a 2018 report by Freedom 
10
House— 
11
(A) China has stepped up efforts to use 
12
digital media to increase its own power, both in-
13
side and outside of China; 
14
(B) in 2018, for the second year in a row, 
15
China was the worst abuser of internet free-
16
dom, and during that year, the Government of 
17
China hosted media officials from dozens of 
18
countries for 2- and 3-week seminars on its 
19
sprawling system of censorship and surveillance; 
20
(C) Chinese companies have supplied tele-
21
communications hardware, advanced facial-rec-
22
ognition technology, and data analytics tools to 
23
a variety of governments with poor human 
24
rights records, which could benefit Chinese in-

1

2
(D) China’s Belt and Road Initiative in-
3
cludes a ‘‘Digital Silk Road’’ of Chinese-built 
4
fiber-optic networks that could expose internet 
5
traffic to greater monitoring by local and Chi-
6
nese intelligence agencies, given that China is 
7
determined to set the technical standards for 
8
how the next generation of traffic is coded and 
9
transmitted. 
10
(2) As part of its engagement with Latin Amer-
11
ican and Caribbean governments, China has begun 
12
promoting the installation of pervasive surveillance 
13
camera systems, under the pretext of citizen secu-
14
rity, in Bolivia, Ecuador, and Venezuela, to be fi-
15
nanced, designed, installed, and maintained by com-

(1) China is exporting its model for internal se-

lead to breaches of citizens’ private information, in-
