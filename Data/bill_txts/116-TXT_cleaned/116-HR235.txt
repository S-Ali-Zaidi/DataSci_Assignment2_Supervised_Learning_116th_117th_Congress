RESOLUTION 
Recognizing Women’s History Month and the historic 
contributions of women to the American labor movement. 
Whereas women’s labor has historically been denigrated and 
overlooked in a male-dominated society, and women were 
long excluded from the workforce; 
Whereas women have made critical contributions to the labor 
movement since its inception by leading strikes, orga-
nizing workers, and demanding progress in pursuit of fair 
compensation and strong protection; 
Whereas women workers suffered some of the greatest of 
abuses on the job, such as the horrific Triangle Shirt-
waist Factory Fire in New York City, in which over a 
hundred immigrant women workers lost their lives;

Whereas women heroically flooded into our Nation’s factories 
during World War II, and by way of such patriotism, 
helped win the war and drive economic prosperity 
through the following decades; 
Whereas women of color in the labor movement, such as Lucy 
Parsons and Dolores Huerta, battled through both gen-
der barriers and racial prejudice in pursuit of a more eq-
uitable workplace for all Americans; 
Whereas today many women hold important leadership posi-
tions in major national labor unions; and 
Whereas New York’s 13th Congressional District is home to 
many women leaders in the labor community, from teach-
ers to childcare workers to transportation workers, and 
they have demonstrated true leadership within key 
unions, including CWA Local 1180, the Central Labor 
Council—AFL–CIO, 1199 and 32BJ of the SEIU, HTC, 
RWDSU, UFT, UNITE HERE Local 100, DC37, TWU, 
NYSNA, AFT, UFCW’s Local 888, and AFSCME’s 
Local 299 and Local 372: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—

6
women’s work, the dignity of equal pay, respect for

women’s leadership, and high standards for labor 
8
rights for all workers; and
