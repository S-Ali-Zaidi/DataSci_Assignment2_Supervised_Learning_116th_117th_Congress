SEC. 4. DIFFERENTIATING MILITARY TRAINING PROGRAMS 
1
BASED ON TYPOLOGY OF RISK. 
2
(a) IN GENERAL.—In determining who should be ac-
3
cepted in military training programs operated in the 
4
United States by the Department of Defense, the Sec-
5
retary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of 
6
State, shall develop a method for classifying the relative 
7
risk, by country, of accepting foreign military personnel 
8
into such programs. The risk level of an applicant’s coun-
9
try of nationality shall be considered by the Secretary 
10
when making such determinations. 
11
(b) POSITIVE RISK FACTORS.—In classifying coun-
12
tries based on relative risks under subsection (a), an appli-
13
cant shall be more likely to be accepted into a military 
14
training program in the United States if the country of 
15
his or her nationality— 
16
(1) has a formal military alliance with the 
17
United States; or 
18
(2) has a long history of close cooperation with 
19
the United States Armed Forces that— 
20

21
trust; and

23
their own applicants for military training pro-
24
grams in the United States.

(c) NEGATIVE RISK FACTORS.—In classifying coun-
1
tries based on relative risks under subsection (a), an appli-
2
cant shall be less likely to be accepted into a military 
3
training program in the United States if— 
4
(1) the country of his or her nationality— 
5
(A) has not closely cooperated with the 
6
United States Armed Forces; or 
7
(B) has not demonstrated its ability to vet 
8
their own applicants for military training pro-
9
grams in the United States procedures; or 
10
(2) hosting applicants from the country of his 
11
or her nationality has a high potential to put Amer-
12
ican communities and military families at risk.

PRO-
14
GRAMS.—If the Secretary of Defense determines, in ac-
15
cordance with this section, that applicants from specified 
16
countries present too high of a risk for acceptance into 
17
a military training program in the United States and 
18
issued a military training visa under section 214(s) of the 
19
Immigration and Nationality Act, as added by section 
20
3(a), the Secretary of State shall provide, to the fullest 
21
extent possible, an equivalent military training program 
22
for such applicants in the country of the applicant’s na-
23
tionality or in a third country—

7
Not later than 2 years after the date of the enact-
8
ment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall provide 
9
Congress with a briefing, report, or update regarding the 
10
impact and effects of this Act, which shall address—
