Whereas health care, pharmaceutical, and research sectors 
working on COVID-19 response are the prime targets of 
these attacks; 
Whereas, on May 13, 2020, the Federal Bureau of Investiga-
tion (FBI) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Se-
curity Agency (CISA) issued a public announcement to 
raise awareness of the cyber threat to COVID-19-related 
research and that any potential theft of such research 
would jeopardize the delivery of secure, effective, and effi-
cient treatment options for American citizens; 
Whereas the FBI and CISA attributed the attacks on these 
American organizations to the People’s Republic of China 
(PRC); 
Whereas the PRC has a long history of conducting cyber-at-
tacks on Americans and the United States Government, 
including the 2015 hack of the Office of Personnel Man-
agement, which resulted in the theft of private informa-
tion belonging to millions of American citizens: Now, 
therefore, be it
