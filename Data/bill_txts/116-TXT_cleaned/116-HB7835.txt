with respect to the awarding of certain medals to persons 
1
who served in the Armed Forces, the President may award 
2
the Medal of Honor under section 7271 of such title to 
3
Eric Fisher Wood, Jr. for the acts of valor during the Bat-

tle of the Bulge described in subsection (b). 
5
(b) ACTS OF VALOR DESCRIBED.—(1) The acts of 
6
valor referred to in subsection (a) are the actions of Eric 
7
Fisher Wood, Jr. in the Ardennes region of Wallonia, Bel-
8
gium, during the Battle of the Bulge, when, as a Lieuten-
9
ant in Battery A, 589th Field Artillery Battalion, 106th 
10
Infantry Division, from December 17, 1944, to January 
11
22, 1945, he displayed extraordinary heroism in action 
12
against the enemy in Belgium. 
13
(2) After ordering his artillery battery to fire against 
14
enemy tanks in a delaying action, allowing other American 
15
units avoid capture, his unit was surrounded and forced 
16
to surrender. Rather than accept capture, as enemy fire 
17
converged on him from all sides, he raced across a large 
18
open field into the woods beyond. 
19
(3) Cut off from his own lines, and surrounded by 
20
the enemy in the Ardennes forest, Lieutenant Wood rallied 
21
a small band of American soldiers who were also separated 
22
from their units. Over the course of several weeks, he re-
23
peatedly initiated harassing ambush attacks against 
24
enemy communications, supply columns and patrols, ac-

counting for the deaths and wounding of scores of enemy 
1
soldiers and further slowing their advance to strategic 
2
road intersections and helping other American units from 
3
being overrun or captured. 
4
(4) Lieutenant Wood continued his offensive actions 
5
until a final, fierce engagement with overwhelming enemy 
6
forces, where he made the last full measure of service. His 
7
body was found surrounded by several enemy dead. Lieu-
8
tenant Wood’s extraordinary heroism and selflessness 
9
above and beyond the call of duty in the service of his 
10
country are in keeping with the highest traditions of mili-
11
tary service. Lieutenant Wood was posthumously awarded 
12
the Distinguished-Service Cross, Silver Star, Bronze Star, 
13
and the Purple Heart for his heroism.
