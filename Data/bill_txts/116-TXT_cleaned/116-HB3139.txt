A BILL 
To better support our early childhood educators and elemen-
tary school and secondary school teachers, and for other 
purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE AND FINDINGS. 
3
(a) SHORT TITLE.—This Act may be cited as the 
4
‘‘Supporting the Teaching profession through Revitalizing 
5
Investments in Valuable Educators Act’’ or the ‘‘STRIVE 
6
Act’’. 
7
(b) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:

•HR 3139 IH
(1) States identified significant teacher short-
1
ages in their reports to the Department of Edu-
2
cation during the 2017–2018 school year, with 46 
3
States and the District of Columbia identifying 
4
shortages in special education, 47 States and the 
5
District of Columbia identifying teacher shortages in 
6
mathematics, 43 States identifying teacher shortages 
7
in science, 32 States identifying shortages in teach-
8
ers of English learners, and 32 States identifying 
9
teacher shortages in career and technical education. 
10
One reason for the shortages in these areas is be-
11
cause mathematics and science teachers can earn 
12
significantly higher starting salaries in the private 
13
sector. Further, rural communities face limitations 
14
in recruiting and retaining teachers for reasons such 
15
as funding issues, limited teacher supply, and geo-
16
graphic isolation. 
17
(2) Students in high-poverty and high-minority 
18
schools, both urban and rural, typically feel the larg-
19
est impact of teacher shortages. These schools often 
20
experience difficulty hiring and high turnover on a 
21
regular basis, and they are the most severely af-
22
fected when teacher shortages become widespread. 
23
This happens, in part, because inequitable funding 
24
of schools leaves many low-wealth urban and rural 
25
18:19 Jun 18, 2019
H3139

•HR 3139 IH
communities with inadequate resources, so they 
1
must pay lower salaries and typically have poorer 
2
working conditions. 
3
(3) According to a study by Mathematica, when 
4
high-performing teachers were offered large financial 
5
incentives to transfer to low-performing schools, 
6
their students’ scores climbed 10 points in reading 
7
and 9 points in math compared to students state-
8
wide over 2 years. 
9
(4) According to a survey conducted by Scho-
10
lastic, 97 percent of teachers list supportive school 
11
leadership as essential or very important for retain-
12
ing strong teachers and improving student achieve-
13
ment, more than any other factor. 
14
(5) Research suggests that incurring postsec-
15
ondary education debt can decrease the likelihood 
16
that high-achieving students, lower-income students, 
17
and students of color choose to work in lower-wage 
18
professions in general, especially in the education 
19
system. Therefore, loan forgiveness and service 
20
scholarships for educators may be especially effective 
21
for recruiting teachers and school leaders from di-
22
verse, lower-income backgrounds. 
23
(6) According to the Learning Policy Institute, 
24
teacher loan forgiveness and service scholarship pro-
25

grams can be successful in both recruiting and re-
1
taining teachers. To be effective, these programs 
2
should provide a financial benefit that meaningfully 
3
offsets the cost of a teacher’s professional prepara-
4
tion. This includes covering licensing and certifi-
5
cation costs. 
6
(7) A 2015 Government Accountability Office 
7
study and a 2018 follow up study by the Depart-
8
ment of Education of Federal grant and loan for-
9
giveness programs for teachers found that the struc-
10
ture of these programs matters. Further research 
11
shows effective loan forgiveness and service scholar-
12
ship programs follow 5 design principles. These pro-
13
grams— 
14
(A) cover all or a large percentage of tui-
15
tion; 
16
(B) target high-need fields or schools, or 
17
both; 
18
(C) recruit candidates who are academi-
19
cally strong, committed to teaching, and well- 
20
prepared; 
21
(D) commit recipients to teach with rea-
22
sonable incentives to fulfill their commitment;

(E) are bureaucratically manageable for 
1
participating teachers, local educational agen-
2
cies, and institutions of higher education.

(8) The TEACH grant program under subpart 
4
9 of part A of title IV of the Higher Education Act 
5
of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070g et seq.) provides up to 
6
$16,000 in grants to prospective teachers who agree 
7
to teach in low-income schools and high-need subject 
8
areas for 4 years. This is far below the Department 
9
of Education’s most recent estimate of the average 
10
annual cost of approximately $25,409 in tuition, 
11
fees, and room and board at the average full-time 
12
undergraduate 4-year institution. 
13
(9) The National Center for Education Statis-
14
tics found that more than 2⁄3 of the individuals en-
15
tering the education field borrow money to pay for 
16
their higher education. Teachers with a bachelor’s 
17
degree have an average debt of $20,000 and teach-
18
ers with a master’s degree have an average debt of 
19
$50,000. Teachers also start out earning 20 percent 
20
less than their peers with comparable degrees who 
21
pursue jobs outside of education. According to a re-
22
port by the Center for American Progress, in more 
23
than 30 States, a mid-career teacher heading a fam-
24
ily of 4 is eligible for several forms of government

assistance, including the free and reduced-price 
1
lunch 
program 
for 
their 
children. 
These 
2
compounding factors can disincentivize prospective 
3
teachers from entering the profession. 
4
(10) In evaluating the TEACH grant program, 
5
the Government Accountability Office found that al-
6
most 2⁄3 of the requests for assistance under the pro-
7
gram from October 2011 through March 2014 cited 
8
problems submitting certification paperwork. The 
9
Government Accountability Office recommended im-
10
provements in the program’s design, including re-
11
ducing burdensome annual paperwork, increasing 
12
awareness about the program, and streamlining the 
13
dispute process. 
14
(11) Spending by teachers on school supplies 
15
adds up to $1,600,000,000 per year nationally. Ac-
16
cording to the Education Market Association, most 
17
teachers spend around $500, with 10 percent spend-
18
ing $1,000 or more. 
19
(12) Teacher quality partnerships are designed 
20
to strengthen higher education-based teacher and 
21
school leader preparation. Studies show that teach-
22
ers who are better prepared to enter the classroom 
23
stay longer and perform better than their underpre-
24
pared peers. Teacher quality partnerships also fund 
25
18:19 Jun 18, 2019
H3139
7 
•HR 3139 IH
programs like induction and mentoring that have 
1
been shown to increase teacher and school leader re-
2
tention. Research indicates that the ongoing support 
3
for teachers provided by teacher quality partner-
4
ships, including mentoring and coaching, is an im-
5
portant part of early childhood education programs. 
6
(13) According to the Center for Education 
7
Data and Research, a more diverse teaching work-
8
force leads to better student outcomes, particularly 
9
in high-poverty environments with significant at-risk 
10
student populations. Further, researchers from Van-
11
derbilt University found that greater racial and eth-
12
nic diversity in the principal corps benefits students, 
13
especially children of color. Three commonly cited 
14
rationales for this benefit are— 
15
(A) students of color benefit from seeing 
16
minority adult role models in a position of au-
17
thority; 
18
(B) the higher expectations that teachers 
19
of color tend to place on students of color; and 
20
(C) the effect of cultural differences be-
21
tween teachers of different backgrounds on in-
22
structional strategies and interpretation of stu-
23
dents’ behavior. 
24

•HR 3139 IH
(14) According to the report entitled ‘‘Empow-
1
ered Educators: How Leading Nations Design Sys-
2
tems for Teaching Quality’’, effective teacher prepa-
3
ration successfully integrates theory and practice 
4
components. Further, according to the ‘‘Preparing 
5
Teachers for a Changing World’’ report sponsored 
6
by the National Academy Foundation, highly effec-
7
tive teachers vary in styles, yet have many teaching 
8
strategies in common. Research has identified a set 
9
of knowledge, skills, and dispositions essential for 
10
beginning teachers that should be incorporated into 
11
the teacher education curriculum. This includes the 
12
opportunity and capacity to reflect on and evaluate 
13
skills and to learn from practice. Evidence-based 
14
teacher preparation includes developing teacher 
15
skills, content knowledge, inquiry, and the capacity 
16
to provide effective learning experiences for a diverse 
17
set of students. 
18
(15) As it does in medicine, the Federal Gov-
19
ernment should maintain a substantial, sustained 
20
program of service scholarships or loan forgiveness 
21
programs that cover training costs in high-quality 
22
preparation programs at the undergraduate or grad-
23
uate level for those who will teach in a high-need 
24
field or location for at least 4 years, as candidates

are much more likely to remain in the profession 
1
and to make a difference for student achievement 
2
after 3 years of teaching. State governments can 
3
augment such an approach with programs targeted 
4
to specific local needs. 
5
(16) Research has shown the impact cultural 
6
competence can have on closing student achievement 
7
gaps and improving student outcomes by incor-
8
porating racial and ethnic minority contributions in 
9
curricula and diversifying pedagogical practices. Cul-
10
tural competence is both a moral and ethical respon-
11
sibility to create a welcoming environment for stu-
12
dents to succeed. The impact of having educators 
13
who have the ability to challenge and motivate di-
14
verse student populations can dramatically improve 
15
our educational system and student outcomes.
