RESOLUTION 
Condemning anti-Semitism as hateful expressions of intoler-
ance that are contradictory to the values and aspirations 
that define the people of the United States and con-
demning anti-Muslim discrimination and bigotry against 
minorities as hateful expressions of intolerance that are 
contrary to the values and aspirations of the United 
States. 
Whereas the first amendment to the Constitution established 
the United States as a country committed to the prin-
ciples of tolerance and religious freedom, and the 14th 
amendment to the Constitution established equal protec-

tion of the laws as the heart of justice in the United 
States; 
Whereas adherence to these principles is vital to the progress 
of the American people and the diverse communities and 
religious groups of the United States; 
Whereas whether from the political right, center, or left, big-
otry, discrimination, oppression, racism, and imputations 
of dual loyalty threaten American democracy and have no 
place in American political discourse; 
Whereas White supremacists in the United States have ex-
ploited and continue to exploit bigotry and weaponize 
hate for political gain, targeting traditionally persecuted 
peoples, including African Americans, Native Americans, 
and other people of color, Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs, 
immigrants, and others with verbal attacks, incitement, 
and violence; 
Whereas the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., taught that 
persecution of any American is an assault on the rights 
and freedoms of all Americans; 
Whereas on August 11 and 12, 2017, self-identified neo-Con-
federates, White nationalists, neo-Nazis, and Ku Klux 
Klansmen held White supremacist events in Charlottes-
ville, Virginia, where they marched on a synagogue under 
the Nazi swastika, engaged in racist and anti-Semitic 
demonstrations and committed brutal and deadly violence 
against peaceful Americans; 
Whereas a White nationalist murdered nine African-American 
worshipers at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal 
Church in Charleston, South Carolina, on the evening of 
June 17, 2015, in the hopes of igniting a nationwide race 
war;

Whereas, on October 27, 2018, the perpetrator of the dead-
liest attack on Jewish people in the history of the United 
States killed 11 worshippers at the Tree of Life Syna-
gogue building in Pittsburgh and reportedly stated that 
he ‘‘wanted all Jews to die’’; 
Whereas anti-Semitism is the centuries-old bigotry and form 
of racism faced by Jewish people simply because they are 
Jews; 
Whereas in 2017 the Federal Bureau of Investigation re-
ported a 37-percent increase in hate crimes against Jews 
or Jewish institutions and found that attacks against 
Jews or Jewish institutions made up 58.1 percent of all 
religious-based hate crimes; 
Whereas there is an urgent need to ensure the safety and se-
curity of Jewish communities, including synagogues, 
schools, cemeteries, and other institutions; 
Whereas Jews are the targets of anti-Semitic violence at even 
higher rates in many other countries than they are in the 
United States; 
Whereas it is a foreign policy priority of the United States 
to monitor and combat anti-Semitism abroad; 
Whereas anti-Semitism includes blaming Jews as Jews when 
things go wrong; calling for, aiding, or justifying the kill-
ing or harming of Jews in the name of a radical ideology 
or extremist view of religion; or making mendacious, de-
humanizing, demonizing, or stereotyped allegations about 
Jews; 
Whereas Jewish people are subject in the media and political 
campaigns to numerous other dangerous anti-Semitic 
myths as well, including that Jews control the United

States Government or seek global, political, and financial 
domination and that Jews are obsessed with money; 
Whereas scapegoating and targeting of Jews in the United 
States have persisted for many years, including by the 
Ku Klux Klan, the America First Committee, and by 
modern neo-Nazis; 
Whereas accusing Jews of being more loyal to Israel or to the 
Jewish community than to the United States constitutes 
anti-Semitism because it suggests that Jewish citizens 
cannot be patriotic Americans and trusted neighbors, 
when Jews have loyally served our Nation every day since 
its founding, whether in public or community life or mili-
tary service; 
Whereas accusations of dual loyalty generally have an insid-
ious and pernicious history, including— 
(1) the discriminatory incarceration of Americans of 
Japanese descent during World War II on their basis of 
race and alleged dual loyalty; 
(2) the Dreyfus affair, when Alfred Dreyfus, a Jew-
ish French artillery captain, was falsely convicted of 
passing secrets to Germany based on his Jewish back-
ground; 
(3) when the loyalty of President John F. Kennedy 
was questioned because of his Catholic faith; and 
(4) the post-9/11 conditions faced by Muslim-Ameri-
cans in the United States, including Islamophobia and 
false and vicious attacks on and threats to Muslim-Amer-
icans for alleged association with terrorism; 
Whereas anti-Muslim bigotry entails prejudicial attitudes to-
wards Muslims and people who are perceived to be Mus-
lim, including the irrational belief that Muslims are in-
herently violent, disloyal, and foreign; 
02:12 Mar 08, 2019

•HRES 183 IH 
Whereas Muslims and people perceived to be Muslim are sub-
jected to false and dangerous stereotypes and myths in-
cluding unfair allegations that they sympathize with indi-
viduals who engage in violence or terror or support the 
oppression of women, Jews, and other vulnerable commu-
nities; 
Whereas in 2017, mosques were bombed in Bloomington, 
Minnesota, and burned in Austin, Texas, Victoria, Texas, 
Bellevue, Washington, and Thonotosassa, Florida, and 
mass attacks on Muslim communities were planned 
against communities in Islamberg, New York, in 2019, 
Jacksonville, Florida, in 2017, and Garden City, Kansas, 
in 2016; 
Whereas the Federal Bureau of Investigation reported that 
hate crimes against Muslims or Muslim institutions in 
the United States increased by over 99 percent between 
2014 and 2016; 
Whereas attacks motivated by bigotry against those who are 
Muslim or perceived to be Muslim have substantially in-
creased since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks; 
Whereas the violation of an individual’s civil rights based on 
his or her actual or perceived membership in a particular 
religious group clearly violates the Constitution and laws 
of the United States; and 
Whereas all Americans, including Jews, Muslims, and Chris-
tians and people of all faiths and no faith, have a stake 
in fighting anti-Semitism, as all Americans have a stake 
in fighting every form of bigotry and hatred against peo-
ple based on religion, race, or place of birth and origin: 
Now, therefore, be it
