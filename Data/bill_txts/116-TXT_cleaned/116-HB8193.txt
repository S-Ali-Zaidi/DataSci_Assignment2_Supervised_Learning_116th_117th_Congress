SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
The Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Title IX of the Education Amendments of 
3
1972 (20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.) (in this Act referred 
4
to as ‘‘title IX’’) mandates that no individual in the 
5
United States shall be excluded on the basis of sex 
6
from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or 
7
be subjected to discrimination under any education 
8
program or activity that receives Federal financial 
9
assistance. 
10
(2) Although title IX protects against sexual 
11
and sex-based harassment and violence, sexual as-
12
saults in K–12 schools and institutions of higher 
13
education remain a pervasive problem. 
14
(3) Peer sexual harassment is a significant so-
15
cial problem with consequences for both students 
16
and schools. Four out of 5 students report experi-
17
encing sexual harassment. These experiences have 
18
been linked to poor psychological health and aca-
19
demic withdrawal. 
20
(4) Many school districts have only a part-time, 
21
single title IX coordinator at the local educational 
22
agency level to oversee principals, school-site specific 
23
title IX coordinators, staff, and the safety of thou-
24
sands of students. 
25

•HR 8193 IH
(5) Although educational institutions have a 
1
legal responsibility to enforce, monitor, and respond 
2
to sexual harassment and assault, far more students 
3
experience sexual harassment than schools report.
