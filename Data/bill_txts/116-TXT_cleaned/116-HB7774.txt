(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
11
(1) Indian Tribes are sovereign nations that are 
12
independent and legally distinct political bodies that 
13
exercise self-governance with the inherent power to 
14
control their internal relations including natural re-

•HR 7774 IH
source development and management of assets, in-
1
cluding spectrum over Tribal lands. 
2
(2) This longstanding precedent established ter-
3
ritorial sovereignty through distinct and separate ju-
4
risdictions in which Indian Tribes retain their sov-
5
ereign power to control their internal relations and 
6
protect Tribal self-governance within designated 
7
Tribal lands or reservations. 
8
(3) Tribal lands were established during the 
9
‘‘Allotment’’ or ‘‘Reservation’’ era of Federal Indian 
10
law and policy (1871–1928) when the Federal Gov-
11
ernment significantly narrowed the control and 
12
rights of Indian Tribes through the unilateral acqui-
13
sition of Tribal lands and resources, then subse-
14
quently gave the rights to this property to non-In-
15
dian settlers. 
16
(4) Under the General Allotment Act of 1887, 
17
Tribal members were forced to surrender their pre-
18
viously undivided interest in Tribally owned trust es-
19
tate for individually assigned land interests creating 
20
permanently divided land allotments on Tribal lands, 
21
and further coercing Native Americans into assimila-
22
tion and dependency on the Federal Government, 
23
thus depriving them of their traditional economies.

•HR 7774 IH
(5) Congress has acknowledged that this Res-
1
ervation Era policy is widely known as failed Federal 
2
policy that established individual non-Indian land 
3
holdings on reservations resulting in checkerboarded 
4
Tribal lands that cause complex jurisdictional and 
5
legal complications today. 
6
(6) In response to these failed, paternalistic 
7
Federal assimilation policies, forced acquisition of 
8
indigenous lands, and genocide of Native Americans, 
9
the United States has recognized the unique legal 
10
relationship and trust responsibility it has with 
11
American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Ha-
12
waiians to promote their self-determination and sov-
13
ereignty in furtherance of its treaty obligations and 
14
longstanding government-to-government relationship. 
15
(7) Congressional authority to manage this 
16
unique government-to-government relationship with 
17
Native nations and Indian affairs generally is recog-
18
nized as plenary; constitutionally vested congres-
19
sional authority to regulate commerce and govern 
20
activities with Indian Tribes, which is distinct and 
21
separate from executive and judicial branch powers. 
22
(8) The Federal Government’s trust responsi-
23
bility with Indian Tribes extends to all governmental 
24
branches requiring the United States to uphold its 
25
16:58 Aug 15, 2020

•HR 7774 IH
fiduciary duties of care and loyalty, to make trust 
1
property income productive, to enforce reasonable 
2
claims on behalf of Native Americans, and to take 
3
affirmative action to preserve trust property, for the 
4
benefit of American Indians and Alaska Natives, 
5
and Native Hawaiians as part of this Federal-Tribal 
6
relationship and Tribal self-governance. 
7
(9) The Federal Communications Commission 
8
(FCC) has acknowledged this fiduciary responsibility 
9
to Native nations and has further recognized the 
10
Commission’s own responsibility to promote their 
11
self-sufficiency and economic development on Tribal 
12
lands. 
13
(10) In 2018, a Government Accountability Of-
14
fice (GAO) report noted that numerous Tribal enti-
15
ties, associations, and academic groups consider 
16
spectrum as a natural resource that should be man-
17
aged by Tribes. FCC officials responded that, ‘‘spec-
18
trum is not considered a reserved right under trea-
19
ties with Indian tribes, as it is not explicitly stated’’. 
20
(11) The first United States treaty with an 
21
American Indian Tribe was ratified in 1778, over 
22
240 years ago, and Indian treaty-making ended in 
23
1871, prior to the development of spectrum, and

adoption of the existing regime for licensing and reg-
1
ulating spectrum access. 
2
(12) Further, a 2020 GAO report repeatedly 
3
stated that ‘‘spectrum is a finite natural resource 
4
used to provide a variety of communication services’’ 
5
to governmental entities. 
6
(13) However, with the exception of the FCC’s 
7
efforts to allocate a severely limited bandwidth of 
8
temporary spectrum authority to select Tribal appli-
9
cants during the COVID–19 crisis, it failed to grant 
10
numerous emergency requests from Congress, Indian 
11
Tribes, and Native Hawaiian organizations to extend 
12
the 2.5 GHz Rural Tribal Priority Window timeline 
13
by 180 days to give Native nations a fair oppor-
14
tunity to secure spectrum over their Tribal lands be-
15
fore the August 3, 2020, expiration date amidst the 
16
pandemic. 
17
(14) To date, the Commission has failed to im-
18
plement nationwide spectrum opportunities or uni-
19
form licensing for Indian Tribes and Native Hawai-
20
ian organizations to make spectrum available over 
21
their Tribal lands or account for the unmet needs of 
22
native Nations in compliance with the Federal trust 
23
responsibility.

•HR 7774 IH
(15) To the contrary, the FCC has used its 
1
general authority to regulate for-profit commercial 
2
use of spectrum over Tribal lands to assign Indian 
3
Tribes’ spectrum licenses to non-Indian companies 
4
through privatized auctions, by promulgating regula-
5
tions for licensed and unlicensed spectrum over Trib-
6
al lands, and by conducting oversight over secondary 
7
market transactions, including leasing spectrum li-
8
censes over Tribal lands and Hawaiian Home Lands 
9
to private companies without Tribal consultation or 
10
consent. 
11
(16) The Commission’s actions parallel failed 
12
Federal Reservation Era policy that divided Indian 
13
land holdings and created systemic barriers to In-
14
dian Tribes’ economic development and legal juris-
15
dictional complications on Tribal lands that continue 
16
to disadvantage Tribal communities today. 
17
(17) Indian Tribes and Native Hawaiian orga-
18
nizations continue to encounter substantial barriers 
19
to accessing spectrum on Tribal lands and Hawaiian 
20
Home Lands to deploy telecommunications services 
21
for the safety and well-being of their members to de-
22
crease the alarming rates of violent crimes, suicides,

and additional unnecessary loss of lives that Native

Americans disproportionately experience, especially

through the lack of access to telehealth services and 
1
digital emergency resources as demonstrated during 
2
the COVID–19 pandemic that disproportionately im-
3
pacted Indian Country. 
4
(18) Further, the 2018 Broken Promises Re-
5
port published by the United States Commission on 
6
Civil Rights found Native Americans rank near the 
7
bottom of all Americans in terms of health, edu-
8
cation, and employment due to the unique challenges 
9
and harsh living conditions as a result of the Res-
10
ervation Era when the Federal Government relo-
11
cated Indian Tribes to geographically isolated res-
12
ervations where ‘‘persistent discrimination has ren-
13
dered their reality often invisible to other Ameri-
14
cans’’. 
15
(19) Today, Tribal lands are some of the most 
16
digitally disconnected areas in the United States, 
17
where 1.5 million people lack basic broadband and 
18
wireless services at rates comparable to, and in some 
19
cases lower than, developing countries, leaving Trib-
20
al lands further behind in the digital divide by global 
21
benchmarks. 
22
(20) In 2018, the Broadband Commission for 
23
Sustainable Development reported that wireless net-
24
work coverage in Sub-Saharan Africa increased to 
25
16:58 Aug 15, 2020
H7774
9 
•HR 7774 IH
70 percent, surpassing the network coverage rates 
1
on Tribal lands and Hawaiian Home Lands in the 
2
United States. 
3
(21) In 2018, the Government Accountability 
4
Office (GAO) and the Federal Communications 
5
Commission (FCC) reported that over 92 percent of 
6
people living outside of Tribal lands and Hawaiian 
7
Home Lands have access to fixed broadband serv-
8
ices, and 98 percent of American households have 
9
telephone services. However, only 65 percent of 
10
American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Ha-
11
waiians living on Tribal lands and Hawaiian Home 
12
Lands have access to fixed broadband services, and 
13
only 69 percent of households on Tribal lands have 
14
telephone services. 
15
(22) Lack of Indian Tribes’ access to spectrum 
16
over their Tribal lands during the COVID–19 pan-
17
demic also highlighted Indian Country’s expanding 
18
digital divide, as supported by the GAO’s finding 
19
that health information technology systems at the 
20
Indian Health Service (IHS) rank as the Federal 
21
Government’s third-highest need for agency system 
22
modernization since 50 percent of IHS facilities de-
23
pend on outdated circuit connections based on one 
24
or two T1 circuit lines (3 Mbps), creating slower re-

sponse times than any other health facility system in 
1
the country. 
2
(23) A 2018 National Congress of American In-
3
dians and National Indian Health Board health re-
4
form comment filed with the Federal Communica-
5
tions Commission has further stated that 75 percent 
6
of rural Indian Health Service (IHS) facilities do 
7
not have reliable broadband networks for American 
8
Indians and Alaska Natives to access telehealth- 
9
based services, which is a critical need in the most 
10
geographically isolated areas of the United States 
11
with some of the highest poverty rates, and lack of 
12
access to reliable transportation. 
13
(24) Additionally, IHS officials reported during 
14
the COVID–19 pandemic that deficiencies within 
15
their health IT system inhibited the agency’s ability 
16
to adequately conduct coronavirus disease surveil-
17
lance and record accurate data contributing to the 
18
disproportional rates of coronavirus transmissions on 
19
reservations. 
20
(25) The Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) 
21
estimated from a survey of 142 out of 174 schools, 
22
that up to 95 percent of their students do not have 
23
access to residential internet services depending on

•HR 7774 IH
Bureau school locations and data cap limitations be-

fore and during the pandemic. 
2
(26) As an additional barrier, no dedicated 
3
Federal funding streams exist for Indian Tribes or 
4
Native Hawaiian organizations to deploy tele-
5
communications or broadband services, both wireline 
6
and wireless, on Tribal lands and Hawaiian Home 
7
Lands. In 2018, the GAO found that the FCC and 
8
Department of Agriculture’s combined total of 
9
$34,600,000,000 was available for broadband serv-
10
ices and infrastructure; however, from 2010 to 2017, 
11
only 0.7 percent was allocated to Tribal tele-
12
communications deployment. 
13
(27) It is estimated that only 0.3 percent of the 
14
13,000 radio facilities in the country belong to feder-
15
ally recognized Indian Tribes, indicating a severe 
16
lack of Tribal ownership of telecommunications serv-
17
ices generally. 
18
(28) Indian Tribes’ and Native Hawaiian orga-
19
nizations’ longstanding funding and administrative 
20
barriers to access spectrum over Tribal lands and 
21
Hawaiian Home Lands prohibits their self-govern-
22

demonstrate the third-party licensee failed to meet

totality of the circumstances standard in presenting

the case of the Indian Tribe, Native Hawaiian orga-

ate whether the negotiations were made in good

(5) GOOD FAITH NEGOTIATION REQUIREMENT 
11
FACTORS.—The relevant factors to determine wheth-
12
er the third-party licensee failed to negotiate in good 
13
faith are to include the following objective elements 
14
of negotiation standards: 
15
(A) The third-party licensee must have ap-
16
pointed a negotiating representative with au-
17
thority to bargain on partitioning and spectrum 
18
licensing issues. 
19
(B) The third-party licensee must have 
20
agreed to meet at reasonable times and loca-
21
tions with adequate notice. 
22
(C) The third-party licensee must not have 
23
acted in a manner that would unduly delay the 
24
course of negotiations. 
25
16:58 Aug 15, 2020
H7774
31 
•HR 7774 IH
(D) The third-party licensee must not have 
1
put forth an unreasonable, unilateral proposal 
2
or further demonstrated an unwillingness to 
3
consider alternative reasonable terms or coun-
4
terproposals. Bargaining without consideration 
5
of reasonable alternatives is inconsistent with 
6
an affirmative obligation to negotiate in good 
7
faith. 
8
(E) The third-party licensee must have 
9
showed good faith in negotiations through im-
10
plementing or concluding action within a rea-
11
sonable time period with reasonable notice and 
12
forum requests that are standard for negoti-
13
ating practices. This standard is also applicable 
14
to any proposed forum requests by either party. 
15
Indian Tribes, Native Hawaiian organizations, 
16
and qualifying Tribal entities availing them-
17
selves of this process can also make a showing 
18
that the third-party licensee had reasonable no-
19
tice or understanding that the Indian Tribe, 
20
Native Hawaiian organization, or qualifying 
21
Tribal entity did not have the financial means 
22
to fulfill the third-party licensee’s expedited 
23
timing or change of forum requests or that ex-

16:58 Aug 15, 2020

•HR 7774 IH
tenuating circumstances existed that prohibited 
1
reasonable conduct to execute negotiations. 
2
(F) The Indian Tribe, Native Hawaiian or-
3
ganization, or qualifying Tribal entity that is 
4
responding to an offer proposed by the third- 
5
party licensee must also provide reasons and 
6
consideration for rejecting aspects of the third- 
7
party licensee’s offer in writing. 
8
(6) ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS.—The Com-
9
mission may make additional considerations for un-
10
reasonable behavior or egregious behavior for the to-
11
tality of the circumstances standard under this sub-
12
section to determine whether a party negotiated in 
13
bad faith.

(c) SAFE
HARBOR
EXEMPTION
FOR
EXISTING 
15
THIRD-PARTY LICENSEES.—Where a third-party licensee 
16
that holds a license to use spectrum over Tribal lands and 
17
has failed to meet additional construction requirements 
18
determined by the Commission under section 6(a)(5), a 
19
safe harbor exemption may apply to the third-party li-
20
censee, if such licensee has deployed coverage to at least

6
vide a source of funds for networks and infrastructure 
7
buildout over Tribal lands, including support for infra-
8
structure deployment, ‘‘middle mile’’ and long haul fiber 
9
buildout, adoption of digital literacy on Tribal lands, and 
10
other related activities to ensure Tribal lands have full ac-
11

(b) SOURCES OF FUNDING.—In addition to universal 
14
service contributions under section 254(d) of the Commu-
15
nications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 254(d)), the Tribal
