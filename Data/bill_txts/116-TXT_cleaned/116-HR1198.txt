RESOLUTION 
Calling on States to implement ‘‘ban the box’’ legislation. 
Whereas systemic racism within the criminal justice system 
has led to deep racial disparities within the population of 
Americans with felony convictions; 
Whereas a 2017 study from the University of Georgia found 
that while 8 percent of all Americans have a felony con-
viction, 33 percent of African-American males have been 
convicted of a felony; 
Whereas the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission 
recommends that employers refrain from asking about 
conviction history on job applications and limit their que-
ries to job-related convictions or convictions that would 
be consistent with business necessities if they choose to 
ask these questions;

Whereas a 2018 report from the Brookings Institution found 
that one-third of all 30-year-old men in the United States 
who reported no annual earnings are either incarcerated 
or formerly incarcerated; 
Whereas the 2018 Brookings Institution report found that 
while only 49 percent of prime-age men were employed 2 
years prior to their incarceration, 45 percent of former 
prisoners reported no earnings in the year after their re-
lease; 
Whereas a 2003 study in the American Journal of Sociology 
found that stating a criminal record on a job application 
reduces the likelihood of an employer calling back a po-
tential employee by 50 percent; 
Whereas eliminating questions about an applicant’s criminal 
history on their initial applications would allow job appli-
cants a fair hearing with potential employers; 
Whereas 13 States already prohibit private employers from 
asking questions about a job applicant’s conviction his-
tory; 
Whereas an analysis by the Prison Policy Initiative found 
that, in 2008, 27 percent of formerly incarcerated indi-
viduals were unemployed, compared to just 5.2 percent of 
the overall population; 
Whereas the racial disparities in the United States criminal 
justice system are reflected in our current employment 
statistics, as in the second quarter of 2019, 6.1 percent 
of African Americans were unemployed, compared to an 
overall unemployment rate of 3.5 percent during the
