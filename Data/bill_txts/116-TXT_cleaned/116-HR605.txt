RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the goals and ideals of ‘‘National 
Hydrocephalus Awareness Month’’. 
Whereas hydrocephalus, an abnormal accumulation of cere-
brospinal fluid in the brain, is a life-threatening condition 
that affects approximately 1,000,000 Americans of all 
ages; 
Whereas each year, one in 770 babies develops hydro-
cephalus; 
Whereas hospitalization charges for pediatric hydrocephalus 
cases alone cost the United States health care system 
$2,000,000,000 per year; 
Whereas adults living with hydrocephalus add exponentially 
to health care system costs, as well as costs related to re-
duced productivity in the workplace;

Whereas the incidence of undiagnosed and untreated hydro-
cephalus in older Americans can result in unnecessary 
confinement to assisted living facilities and nursing 
homes; 
Whereas up to two-thirds (24,000 potential cases) of our cur-
rent and former military service members suffering from 
moderate to severe traumatic brain injuries are at risk of 
developing hydrocephalus; 
Whereas there is no cure for this condition, and the only 
treatment is costly brain surgery which frequently must 
be repeated to replace the shunt, a medical device that 
is the most common treatment for the condition and has 
one of the highest failure rates of all medical devices; 
Whereas various research studies are being conducted in the 
United States in order to better understand, prevent, and 
treat hydrocephalus; 
Whereas organizations, such as the Pediatric Hydrocephalus 
Foundation and the Hydrocephalus Association, serve as 
global leaders for hydrocephalus awareness, education, 
support, advocacy, and research funding; 
Whereas the Pediatric Hydrocephalus Foundation established 
‘‘National Hydrocephalus Awareness Month’’ in 2009; 
and 
Whereas the Pediatric Hydrocephalus Foundation and the 
Hydrocephalus Association recognize September as ‘‘Na-
tional Hydrocephalus Awareness Month’’: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the goals and ideals of ‘‘National 
2
Hydrocephalus Awareness Month’’; and
