Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Public Safety Officer

Congress finds the following:

(1) Every day, public safety officers, including 
1
police officers, firefighters, emergency medical tech-
2
nicians, and others, work to maintain the safety, 
3
health, and well-being of the communities they serve. 
4
(2) From time to time this means being called 
5
to respond to stressful and potentially traumatic sit-
6
uations, sometimes even putting their own lives in 
7
danger. 
8
(3) This work not only puts them at risk for ex-
9
periencing harm, serious injury, and severe trauma, 
10
but also places them at up to 25.6 times higher risk 
11
for developing post-traumatic stress disorder when 
12
compared to those without such experiences. 
13
(4) Psychological evidence indicates law en-
14
forcement officers experience significant job-related 
15
stressors and exposures that may confer increased 
16
risk for mental health morbidities (for example post- 
17
traumatic stress disorder, and suicidal thoughts and 
18
behaviors), and hastened mortality. 
19
(5) Public safety officers often do not have the 
20
resources or support they need, leaving them at 
21
higher risk for long-term mental health con-
22
sequences. 
23
(6) In 2017, the Department of Justice ap-
24
proved 481 Public Safety Officer Benefit (PSOB)

claims, but not one of them for the over 240 public 
1
safety officers who died by suicide that year. 
2
(7) As it currently stands, officers who have 
3
died or are disabled as a result of suicide or post- 
4
traumatic stress disorder do not qualify for this pro-
5
gram, despite officers being more likely to die by 
6
suicide than in the line of duty.

Section 1201 of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe

Streets Act of 1968 (34 U.S.C. 10281) is amended by

adding at the end the following:

‘‘(o) As determined by the Bureau— 
13
‘‘(1) post-traumatic stress disorder suffered by 
14
a public safety officer, and diagnosed by a licensed 
15
medical or mental health professional, shall be pre-
16
sumed to constitute a personal injury within the 
17
meaning of subsection (a), sustained in the line of 
18
duty by the officer, if the officer, while on duty, en-
19
gages in situations involving stressful, tensional, or 
20
traumatic law enforcement, fire suppression, rescue, 
21
hazardous material response, emergency medical

‘‘(2) in the case that a public safety officer de-
3
scribed in paragraph (1) dies by suicide (for pur-
4
poses of a claim under subsection (a)), or is perma-
5
nently and totally disabled as a result of post-trau-
6
matic stress disorder, including as a result of at-
7
tempted suicide (for purposes of a claim under sub-
8
section (b)), such death or disability shall be pre-
9
sumed to be a direct and proximate result of such 
10
engagement, 
11
unless competent psychological or medical evidence estab-
12
lishes that the post-traumatic stress disorder was unre-
13
lated to the engagement or was directly and proximately 
14
caused by something other than the mere presence of post- 
15
traumatic stress disorder risk factors. For purposes of 
16
paragraph (2), a public safety officer shall be considered 
17
permanently and totally disabled as a result of post-trau-
18
matic stress disorder if the officer is unable to serve as 
19
a public safety officer in the same or substantially similar 
20
role as the officer was serving prior to suffering from post- 
21
traumatic stress disorder.’’.
