education programs to serve Asian Americans and Pacific 
Islanders and low-income students; 
Whereas the Asian American and Native American Pacific Is-
lander-Serving Institutions Program was originally au-
thorized on September 27, 2007, by the College Cost Re-
duction and Access Act of 2007; 
Whereas, since 2007, 217 colleges and universities have been 
eligible to be designated as Asian American and Native 
American Pacific Islander-Serving Institutions through-
out the United States, including the United States terri-
tories; 
Whereas, as of the 2020–2021 academic year, 39 Asian 
American and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving 
Institutions are or have been funded in the United 
States, including the United States territories; 
Whereas Asian American and Native American Pacific Is-
lander-Serving Institutions are of critical importance, as 
they enroll and graduate large proportions of Asian- 
American and Pacific Islander college students, the ma-
jority of whom are overwhelmingly low-income and first- 
generation; 
Whereas Asian American and Native American Pacific Is-
lander-Serving Institutions comprise 5.1 percent of all in-
stitutions of higher education, yet enroll nearly 40 per-
cent of all Asian-American and Pacific Islander under-
graduate students;

elor’s degrees attained by all Asian-American and Pacific 
Islander college students; 
Whereas over half of funded Asian American and Native 
American Pacific Islander-Serving Institutions have an 
Asian-American and Pacific Islander enrollment of over 
20 percent; 
Whereas one-third of the funded Asian American and Native 
American Pacific Islander-Serving Institutions have ac-
tive Asian American Studies programs that play a vital 
role in preserving the heritage, culture, history, and expe-
riences of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders; 
Whereas Asian American and Native American Pacific Is-
lander-Serving Institutions create culturally relevant aca-
demic programming, programs, research, and services to 
support low-income and first-generation students and in-
crease the graduation rates and educational experiences 
of Asian-American and Pacific Islander students; 
Whereas celebrating the vast contributions of Asian American 
and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institu-
tions strengthens the culture of the United States; and 
Whereas the achievements and goals of Asian American and 
Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institutions de-
serve national recognition: Now, therefore, be it
