A BILL 
To establish a new Directorate for Technology in the redesig-
nated National Science and Technology Foundation, to 
establish a regional technology hub program, to require 
a strategy and report on economic security, science, re-
search, and innovation, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Endless Frontier Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 6978 IH
(1) For over 70 years, the United States has 
1
been the unequivocal global leader in scientific and 
2
technological innovation, and as a result the people 
3
of the United States have benefitted through good- 
4
paying jobs, economic prosperity, and a higher qual-
5
ity of life. Today, however, this leadership position 
6
is being eroded and challenged by foreign competi-
7
tors, some of whom are stealing intellectual property 
8
and trade secrets of the United States and aggres-
9
sively investing in fundamental research and com-
10
mercialization to dominate the key technology fields 
11
of the future. While the United States once led the 
12
world in the share of our economy invested in re-
13
search, our Nation now ranks 9th globally in total 
14
research and development and 12th in publicly fi-
15
nanced research and development. 
16
(2) Without a significant increase in investment 
17
in research, education, technology transfer, and the 
18
core strengths of the United States innovation eco-
19
system, it is only a matter of time before the global 
20
competitors of the United States overtake the 
21
United States in terms of technological primacy. The 
22
country that wins the race in key technologies—such 
23
as artificial intelligence, quantum computing, ad-

•HR 6978 IH
vanced communications, and advanced manufac-
1
turing—will be the superpower of the future. 
2
(3) The Federal Government must catalyze 
3
United States innovation by boosting fundamental 
4
research investments focused on discovering, cre-
5
ating, commercializing, and producing new tech-
6
nologies to ensure the leadership of the United 
7
States in the industries of the future. 
8
(4) The distribution of innovation jobs and in-
9
vestment in the United States has become largely 
10
concentrated in just a few locations, while much of 
11
the Nation has been left out of growth in the innova-
12
tion sector. More than 90 percent of the Nation’s in-
13
novation sector employment growth in the last 15 
14
years was generated in just 5 major cities. The Fed-
15
eral Government must address this imbalance in op-
16
portunity by partnering with the private sector to 
17
build new technology hubs across the country, 
18
spreading innovation sector jobs more broadly, and 
19
tapping the talent and potential of the entire Nation 
20
to ensure the United States leads the industries of 
21
the future. 
22
(5) Since its inception, the National Science 
23
Foundation has carried out vital work supporting 
24
basic research and people to create knowledge that 
25
