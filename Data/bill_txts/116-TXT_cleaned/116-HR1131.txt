Whereas Barnard College President Judith Shapiro remem-
bered Sara as ‘‘a person of extraordinary talent and 
promise’’; 
Whereas Sara traveled to Israel with Matthew, a graduate of 
Yale University and a second-year rabbinical student at 
the Jewish Theological Seminary; 
Whereas Ira Weinstein, a dual American and Israeli citizen, 
died of burns suffered from the bus bombing, leaving be-
hind a widow and three children; 
Whereas, since 1993, the terrorist group Hamas has killed 
more than 400 Israelis and at least 25 United States citi-
zens, including Sara Duker; 
Whereas the Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs estimates that 
1,360 people have been killed by Palestinian violence and 
terrorism since September 2000; 
Whereas the Palestinian Authority’s practice of paying sala-
ries to terrorists serving in Israeli prisons, as well as to 
the families of deceased terrorists, is an incentive to com-
mit acts of terror; 
Whereas the Palestinian Authority rewards deadlier attacks 
of terrorism with even more money; 
Whereas, since fiscal year 2015, Congress has mandated the 
reduction of aid for the Palestinian Authority as a result 
of their payments for acts of terrorism including, in fiscal 
year 2017, a dollar-for-dollar reduction of the amount of 
money that the Palestinian Authority and Palestine Lib-
eration Organization pay to terrorists and their families 
from the Economic Support Fund aid that the United 
States provides; 
Whereas, on March 23, 2018, Congress passed the Taylor 
Force Act (Public Law 115–141), bipartisan legislation

which eliminates funds that directly benefit the Pales-
tinian Authority if the Palestinian Authority continues to 
make payments to terrorists; and 
Whereas martyr payments for violence and terror continue to 
undermine the prospects for peace, making it even harder 
to achieve a viable Palestinian state: Now, therefore, be 
it
