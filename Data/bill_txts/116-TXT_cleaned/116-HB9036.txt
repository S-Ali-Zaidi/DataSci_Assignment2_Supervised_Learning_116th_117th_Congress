A BILL 
To amend title VI of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies 
Act of 1978 to establish a Federal renewable electricity 
standard for retail electricity suppliers and a Federal

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

(b) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that— 
1
(1) the Federal renewable electricity standard 
2
established by section 610 of the Public Utility Reg-
3
ulatory Policies Act of 1978 (as added by this Act) 
4
establishes a market-based policy to create ongoing 
5
competition among renewable electricity generators 
6
across the United States and provide the greatest 
7
quantity of clean electricity for the lowest price; 
8
(2) the United States has vast wind, solar, hy-
9
dropower, biomass, and geothermal resources that— 
10
(A) are renewable; 
11
(B) are dispersed widely across different 
12
regions of the United States; and 
13
(C) can be harnessed to generate a signifi-
14
cant share of electricity in the United States; 
15
(3) the Federal energy efficiency resource 
16
standard established by section 611 of the Public 
17
Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (as added by 
18
this Act)— 
19
(A) establishes nationwide minimum levels 
20
of electricity and natural gas savings to be 
21
achieved through utility efficiency programs, 
22
building energy codes, appliance standards, and 
23
related efficiency measures; and

achieved through— 
2
(i) end-use energy efficiency upgrades; 
3
(ii) reduced losses in transmission and 
4
distribution of energy; and 
5
(iii) fuel switching, to the extent that 
6
the switching results in reduced primary 
7
energy use; and 
8
(4) in light of the cost-effective energy effi-
9
ciency opportunities that exist across the United 
10
States in every sector of the economy, retail elec-
11
tricity suppliers, retail natural gas suppliers, and 
12
States should— 
13
(A) include energy efficiency as a resource 
14
in utility planning and procurement activities;

and 
16
(B) seek to achieve all energy efficiency 
17
measures that are available at lower cost than
