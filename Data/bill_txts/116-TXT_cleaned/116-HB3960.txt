•HR 3960 IH
(1) During the more than 50 years since the 
1
United States initially restricted travel by Americans 
2
to Cuba— 
3
(A) the Soviet Union has dissolved into a 
4
dozen independent states; and 
5
(B) the United States has resumed diplo-
6
matic and trade relations with the communist 
7
governments of China and of Vietnam. 
8
(2) There are no such restrictions on travel by 
9
Americans to any other country except North Korea. 
10
(3) While restrictions on travel by Cuban Amer-
11
icans were lifted in 2009, continuing restrictions on, 
12
and requirements of licenses for, travel by non- 
13
Cuban Americans are discriminatory and without 
14
justification. 
15
(4) Since 2013, the Government of Cuba— 
16
(A) has ended restrictions on foreign travel 
17
for most Cubans; 
18
(B) has permitted Cubans to buy and sell 
19
real property; 
20
(C) has permitted hundreds of thousands 
21
of Cubans to work as private entrepreneurs; 
22
and 
23
(D) has greatly expanded public access to 
24
the Internet.

(5) Restrictions on travel by Americans to Cuba 
1
have resulted in a significant loss of revenue for pri-
2
vate Airbnb hosts, restaurants, taxi drivers, and 
3
other small businesses in Cuba. 
4
(6) Many companies in Europe, Canada, Rus-
5
sia, and other countries regularly send their rep-
6
resentatives to Cuba, while American companies can-
7
not do so, preventing American companies, including 
8
banks and credit card companies, from providing 
9
services to Americans who travel to Cuba under a 
10
general license issued by the Office of Foreign As-
11
sets Control of the Department of the Treasury. 
12
(7) A majority of Americans from every region 
13
of the country and in both major political parties 
14
consistently support normalizing travel by Americans 
15
to Cuba. 
16
(8) Ending restrictions on travel to Cuba, and 
17
transactions incident to such travel would— 
18
(A) pose no threat to the security of the 
19
United States; 
20
(B) advance United States national inter-
21
ests in the hemisphere; and 
22
(C) foster free enterprise and democracy in 
23
Cuba.
