curity there were attempts to hack the election infrastruc-
1
ture of 21 States during the 2016 elections. The failing 
2
security and vulnerabilities in our national election infra-
3
structure were later confirmed and highlighted by the 
4
hacking community in a report issued in September 2017, 
5
after the DEFCON 25 conference in Las Vegas, Nevada. 
6
A subsequent report issued in September 2018, after the 
7
DEFCON 26 Conference, highlighted the need for Federal 
8
funding to States to improve the security of election infra-
9
structure. In light of these findings, the Government must 
10
act with all deliberate purpose to ensure that the integrity 
11
of elections in the United States is protected against hack-
12
ers.
