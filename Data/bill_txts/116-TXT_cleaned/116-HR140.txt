RESOLUTION 
Calling on the President to resume the interpretation of 
section 1 of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution 
as originally intended and applied as law for a century. 
Whereas the language of the 14th Amendment to the Con-
stitution is recognized as vital for its contributions to 
civil rights law, due process, and equal protection under 
the law; 
Whereas the first sentence of section 1 of the 14th Amend-
ment to the Constitution was intended to assure that no 
State could deny fair and due citizenship to any formerly 
enslaved person domiciled in the United States; 
Whereas the jurisdiction clause of the 14th Amendment was 
specifically included to modify and clarify ‘‘all persons 
born or naturalized in the United States’’;

Whereas the words ‘‘subject to the jurisdiction thereof’’, as 
written in section 1 of the 14th Amendment to the Con-
stitution, meant not owing any allegiance to another for-
eign power; 
Whereas an illegal alien, upon setting foot into this Nation, 
cannot meet the requirement of section 1 of the 14th 
Amendment to reside in a State; 
Whereas being born on United States soil by parents who are 
illegally inside the country and therefore not under the 
legal jurisdiction of the United States does not qualify a 
person as a citizen of these United States but of the na-
tion to which the mother or father hold citizenship; 
Whereas if a person is present in the United States illegally, 
a child born in the United States to that parent would 
owe allegiance to that foreign power which has jurisdic-
tion over that parent; 
Whereas interpretation of section 1 of the 14th Amendment 
devolved in the latter half of the 20th century away from 
the original intent and clear meaning upon ratification of 
the amendment; 
Whereas the first sentence of section 1 of the 14th Amend-
ment to the Constitution has been manipulated and 
abused by illegal aliens to unfairly gain citizenship for 
their children and incentivizes illegality; 
Whereas ending the practice of automatically extending citi-
zenship to children born in the United States by a moth-
er in the country illegally and therefore not under the ju-
risdiction of the United States should not require an ad-
ditional constitutional amendment; 
Whereas those in the United States illegally are subject to 
our laws by their presence within our border, but are not

subject to the more complete jurisdiction envisioned by 
the 14th Amendment as a precondition for automatic 
citizenship; 
Whereas the Supreme Court has never held that children 
born on United States soil to parents who are in the 
country illegally should automatically receive citizenship; 
Whereas a sovereign nation has the right to determine its 
own qualifications for citizenship; 
Whereas only 30 sovereign nations recognize a form of birth-
right citizenship, including only two, the United States 
and Canada, classified by the International Monetary 
Fund as first world countries; 
Whereas during this century three sovereign nations, Ireland, 
New Zealand, and Australia, have ended their practice of 
birthright citizenship; and 
Whereas section 5 of the 14th Amendment explicitly dele-
gates to Congress the right to determine how the provi-
sions of the amendment are to be applied: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) calls upon the Government of the United 
2
States to return to the proper, original, and in-
3
tended interpretation of section 1 of the 14th 
4
Amendment, taking into account the jurisdiction 
5
clause; 
6
(2) disapproves of birthright citizenship and in-
7
tends to pursue legislative measures if necessary to 
8
ensure the practice is appropriately ended;
