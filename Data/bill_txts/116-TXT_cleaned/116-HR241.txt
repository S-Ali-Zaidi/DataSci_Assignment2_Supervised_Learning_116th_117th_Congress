RESOLUTION 
Condemning the anti-Semitic comments of Representative 
Ilhan Omar from Minnesota. 
Whereas in 2012, Representative Omar tweeted, ‘‘Israel has 
hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and 
help them see the evil doings of Israel.’’; 
Whereas in 2018, Representative Omar posted, ‘‘Drawing at-
tention to the apartheid Israeli regime is far from hating 
Jews.’’; 
Whereas the latest controversial tweets from Representative 
Omar suggest Jewish people are buying political support. 
She tweeted ‘‘It’s all about the Benjamins baby,’’ a ref-

erence to a song about $100 bill, and AIPAC, a pro- 
Israeli lobbying group; 
Whereas Representative Omar stated during a town hall, ‘‘I 
want to talk about the political influence in this country 
that says it is okay to push for the allegiance to a foreign 
country.’’; 
Whereas Speaker Nancy Pelosi denounced Representative 
Omar’s statements saying, ‘‘We condemn these remarks 
and call upon Congresswoman Omar to immediately 
apologize’’ is not going far enough; 
Whereas, on March 7, 2019, Democratic leadership failed to 
primarily and directly address Representative Omar’s 
anti-Semitic remarks in a resolution that should have 
been specifically about anti-Semitism so as to address the 
rising threat thereof; 
Whereas Jewish people are subject in the media and political 
campaigns to numerous other dangerous anti-Semitic 
myths, including that Jewish people control the United 
States Government or seek global, political, and financial 
domination and that Jewish people are obsessed with 
money; 
Whereas accusing Jewish people of being more loyal to Israel 
or to the Jewish community than to the United States 
constitutes anti-Semitism because it suggests that Jewish 
citizens cannot be patriotic Americans and trusted neigh-
bors, when Jewish citizens have loyally served our Nation 
every day since its founding, whether in public or commu-
nity life or military service; 
Whereas all Americans, including Jews, Muslims, and Chris-
tians and people of all faiths and no faith, have a stake 
in fighting anti-Semitism, as all Americans have a stake

in fighting every form of bigotry and hatred against peo-
ple based on religion, race, or place of birth and origin; 
and 
Whereas Representative Omar’s comments reflect negatively 
on the House of Representatives: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) directly disapproves the anti-Semitic com-
2
ments made by Representative Omar; 
3
(2) rejects the perpetuation of anti-Semitic 
4
stereotypes in the United States and around the

world, including the pernicious myth of dual loyalty

and foreign allegiance, especially in the context of 
7
support for the United States-Israel alliance;

(3) condemns anti-Semitic acts and statements 
9
as hateful expressions of intolerance that are con-
10
tradictory to the values that define the people of the 
11
United States; and 
12
(4) seeks to ensure that the United States will 
13
live up to the transcendent principles of tolerance, 
14
religious freedom, and equal protection as embodied 
15
in the Declaration of Independence and the First 
16
and 14th Amendments to the Constitution.
