SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

The Congress makes the following findings: 
7
(1) Cellular and molecular processes may be

used, mimicked, or redesigned to develop new prod-

ucts, processes, and systems that improve societal 
1
well-being, strengthen national security, and con-
2
tribute to the economy. 
3
(2) Engineering biology relies on a workforce 
4
with a diverse and unique set of skills combining the 
5
biological, 
physical, 
chemical, 
and 
information 
6
sciences and engineering. 
7
(3) Long-term research and development is nec-
8
essary to create breakthroughs in engineering biol-
9
ogy. Such research and development requires govern-
10
ment investment as many of the benefits are too dis-
11
tant or uncertain for industry to support alone. 
12
(4) Research is necessary to inform evidence- 
13
based governance of engineering biology and to sup-
14
port the growth of the engineering biology industry. 
15
(5) The Federal Government can play an im-
16
portant role by facilitating the development of tools 
17
and technologies to further advance engineering biol-
18
ogy, including user facilities, by facilitating public- 
19
private partnerships, by supporting risk research, 
20
and by facilitating the commercial application in the 
21
United States of research funded by the Federal 
22
Government. 
23
(6) The United States led the development of 
24
the science and engineering techniques that created

1
ing international competition, the United States is 
2
at risk of losing its competitive advantage if it does 
3
not invest the necessary resources and have a na-
4
tional strategy. 
5
(7) A National Engineering Biology Initiative 
6
can serve to establish new research directions and 
7
technology goals, improve interagency coordination 
8
and planning processes, drive technology transfer to 
9
the private sector, and help ensure optimal returns 
10
on the Federal investment.
