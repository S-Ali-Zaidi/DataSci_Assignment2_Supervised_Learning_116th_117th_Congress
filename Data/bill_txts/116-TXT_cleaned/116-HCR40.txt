CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 
Supporting reproductive health care in the United States. 
Whereas Roe v. Wade (410 U.S. 113 (1973)) upholds the 
constitutional right to privacy, including in health care 
decisions and the right to access abortion care; 
Whereas Roe v. Wade demonstrates quality legal reasoning 
and is consistent with related precedent since it was 
based on sound legal principles first established in Gris-
wold v. Connecticut (1965) and Eisenstadt v. Baird 
(1972), and repeatedly reaffirmed by the Supreme Court, 
including in Obergefell v. Hodges (2015); 
Whereas the facts that have developed since Roe v. Wade was 
decided reaffirm that people of the United States support 
the right to choose, that abortion is a medically safe pro-
cedure, and that access to reproductive health care pro-
vides women with greater economic opportunities; 
Whereas the rights established in Roe v. Wade have been re-
lied upon in this country for almost 50 years; 
Whereas a majority of people of the United States support 
access to abortion care; 
Whereas, while the State of Alabama, the State of Georgia, 
and other States passed laws in 2019 that clearly seek 
to overturn Roe v. Wade and are unconstitutional; mean-
while in 2018 there were over 60 bills introduced in more 
than 21 States to protect and expand access to reproduc-
tive care; 
Whereas low-income individuals and women of color are 
disproportionally impacted by restricting access to abor-
tion care; and
