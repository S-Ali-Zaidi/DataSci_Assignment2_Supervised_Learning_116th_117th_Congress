won their first World Series title in 1969;

Whereas the 1969 New York Mets bested the Chicago Cubs 
led by 3 future Hall-of-Famers to win the Eastern Divi-
sion; 
Whereas the 1969 New York Mets’ victory was so unexpected 
they came to be nicknamed the ‘‘Miracle Mets’’; 
Whereas the success of the 1969 New York Mets gave a 
struggling city a much needed opportunity to celebrate; 
Whereas a country struggling through the Vietnam war was 
given optimism by the characters that were the 1969 
New York Mets; 
Whereas ex-Marines Tom ‘‘The Franchise’’ Seaver and Gil 
Hodges steeled the team through thick and thin to bring 
a championship to a city in desperate need; 
Whereas the slugging of the likes of Ed Kranepool, Art 
Shamsky, Ron Swoboda, Cleon Jones, and Donn 
Clendenon led the unrivaled offense of the 1969 New 
York Mets; 
Whereas the arms of the likes of Tom ‘‘The Franchise’’ 
Seaver, Jerry Koosman, Nolan Ryan, Jim McAndrew, 
Tug McGraw, and Gary Gentry worked to overpower hit-
ters for the 1969 New York Mets; 
Whereas the leadership of Gil Hodges of the 1969 New York 
Mets will forever be unrivaled in Major League Baseball 
history; 
Whereas fifty years later the effect of the 1969 New York 
Mets on the city of New York, the State of New York, 
and the entire country has not been forgotten; and 
Whereas the 1969 New York Mets continue to serve as a re-
minder of why baseball will forever be America’s Pastime: 
Now, therefore, be it
