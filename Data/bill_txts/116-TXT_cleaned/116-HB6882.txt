A BILL 
To amend the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to prohibit 
payments under such Act to States which permit ballot 
harvesting, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Election Fraud Pre-
4
vention Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds that— 
7
(1) the right to vote is a fundamental right of 
8
citizens of the United States;

(2) it is the responsibility of the State and Fed-
1
eral Governments to ensure that elections are con-
2
ducted with integrity; 
3
(3) the Committee on House Administration of 
4
the House of Representatives, which is charged with 
5
investigating election irregularities, received reports 
6
through its official Election Observer Program for 
7
the 2018 general election that individuals other than 
8
voters themselves were depositing large amounts of 
9
absentee ballots at polling places throughout Cali-
10
fornia, a practice colloquially known as ‘‘ballot har-
11
vesting’’; 
12
(4) the practice of ballot harvesting in Cali-
13
fornia creates significant vulnerabilities in the chain- 
14
of-custody of ballots because individuals collecting 
15
ballots are not required to be registered voters and 
16
are not required to identify themselves at a voter’s 
17
home, and the State does not track how many bal-
18
lots are harvested in an election; 
19
(5) in North Carolina, a congressional election 
20
was invalidated due to fraud associated with ballot 
21
harvesting committed by a political operative, and it 
22
is unlikely such activity would have been detected 
23
were it not for the prohibition against ballot har-
24
vesting in the State; and

(6) ballot harvesting invites electioneering activ-
1
ity at home and creates the possibility of undue in-
2
fluence over voters by political operatives.
