Whereas for many years, women across races, ethnicities, so-
cioeconomic statuses, and age groups were underrep-
resented in biomedical and clinical research; 
Whereas the improvement of women’s health relies on sex- 
and gender-based biomedical and clinical research; 
Whereas the promise of individualized medicine cannot be re-
alized without sex- and gender-based parity in research; 
Whereas, on January 25, 2016, the National Institutes of 
Health (NIH) implemented a policy requiring federally 
funded investigators to consider sex as a biological vari-
able in preclinical research; and 
Whereas this policy ushered in a new era of inclusivity and 
parity in women’s health research: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) expresses support for the designation of a 
2
‘‘Women’s Health Research Day’’; and 
3
(2) supports efforts to— 
4
(A) recognize the importance of biomedical 
5
and clinical research to women’s health and 
6
well-being to advancing human health; 
7
(B) increase awareness of the value of sex- 
8
and gender-based biomedical research; and 
9

10

sex- and gender-inclusive research across races,
