CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 
Encouraging the Trump Administration to maintain protec-
tions under the National Environmental Policy Act and 
reverse ongoing administrative actions to weaken this 
landmark law and its protections for American commu-
nities. 
Whereas the National Environmental Policy Act is one of the 
Nation’s bedrock environmental laws that has helped pro-
tect the Nation’s environment and public health for half 
a century; 
Whereas the National Environmental Policy Act was passed 
by an overwhelming bipartisan majority in Congress and 
has long enjoyed widespread public support;

•HCON 89 IH 
Whereas the National Environmental Policy Act has a basic 
but critical purpose of directing Federal agencies to iden-
tify and disclose the significant environmental and public 
health impacts of major Federal actions before such ac-
tions are taken, encouraging a ‘‘look before you leap’’ ap-
proach in Federal decision making; 
Whereas the National Environmental Policy Act appro-
priately gives the public a chance to review and give 
input on major projects before building and development 
starts, resulting in improved, more democratic govern-
ment decision making on everything from fossil fuel, 
transportation, and water infrastructure decisions to 
habitat and ecosystem conservation; 
Whereas the National Environmental Policy Act is one of the 
most important tools available in the fight against the cli-
mate crisis; 
Whereas efforts to block the enforcement of the National En-
vironmental Policy Act will make it easier for corporate 
polluters to hide the air, water, and climate impacts of 
major projects; 
Whereas efforts to block the enforcement of the National En-
vironmental Policy Act will undermine critical building 
requirements that make our roads, bridges, and other in-
frastructure safer and better prepared to withstand nat-
ural disasters such as wildfires, floods, and storms, which 
are getting more destructive and severe as a result of cli-
mate change; 
Whereas efforts to block the enforcement of the National En-
vironmental Policy Act will require the United States to 
spend billions more taxpayer dollars on infrastructure 
projects that won’t survive the effects of climate change;

•HCON 89 IH 
Whereas the National Environmental Policy Act is a critical 
civil rights tool that gives all Americans a voice in Fed-
eral decision making by allowing communities to be in-
formed and weigh in on major proposed projects affecting 
their communities; 
Whereas the National Environmental Policy Act requires 
Federal agencies to evaluate the degree to which pro-
posed projects affect air quality, water quality, public 
health, and public safety in nearby communities and con-
sider alternative approaches that would be better for 
nearby communities and the environment; 
Whereas before the enactment of the National Environmental 
Policy Act there was often no way for people living in dis-
advantaged communities to become aware of, much less 
have their voices heard on, major projects that would re-
sult in disproportionate health and environmental im-
pacts in their neighborhoods; 
Whereas that when the National Environmental Policy Act’s 
public input process is cut short or weakened, ill-con-
ceived projects advance that can have devastating public 
health and environmental consequences for American 
communities; and 
Whereas the National Environmental Policy Act’s charge to 
‘‘foster and maintain conditions under which man and 
nature can exist in productive harmony’’ is timeless and 
its insistence on meaningful local involvement, sustain-
able development, and deliberate Federal decision making 
was, and remains, visionary: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate 
1
concurring), That Congress—
