SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

(1) Investor confidence in fair and equitable re-

securities markets and to the participation of retail 
1
investors in such markets. 
2
(2) Brokers, dealers, and investment advisers 
3
hold powerful advantages over investors, and manda-
4
tory arbitration clauses, including contracts that 
5
force investors to submit claims to arbitration or to 
6
waive their right to participate in a class action, le-
7
verage these advantages to severely restrict the abil-
8
ity of defrauded investors to seek redress. 
9
(3) Investors should be free to choose arbitra-
10
tion to resolve disputes if they judge that arbitration 
11
truly offers them the best opportunity to efficiently 
12
and fairly settle disputes, and investors should also 
13
be free to pursue remedies in court should they view 
14
that option as superior to arbitration.
