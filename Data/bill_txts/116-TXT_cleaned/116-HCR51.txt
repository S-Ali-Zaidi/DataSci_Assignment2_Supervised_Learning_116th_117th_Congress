CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 
Calling on President Donald J. Trump to comply with the 
Emoluments Clause of the United States Constitution. 
Whereas article 1, section 9, clause 8 of the United States 
Constitution states: ‘‘no person holding any office of prof-
it or trust . . . shall, without the consent of the Con-
gress, accept of any present, emolument, office, or title 
of any kind whatever, for any king, prince, or foreign 
state’’; 
Whereas in Federalist No. 22 (Alexander Hamilton) it is 
said, ‘‘One of the weak sides of republics, among their 
numerous advantages, is that they afford too easy an 
inlet to foreign corruption’’; 
Whereas the delegates to the Constitutional Convention spe-
cifically designed the Emoluments Clause as an antidote 
to potentially corrupting foreign practices of a kind that

the Framers had observed during the period of the Con-
federation; 
Whereas the word emoluments means profit, salary, fees, or 
compensation which would include direct payment as well 
as other benefits including extension of credit, forgiveness 
of debt, or the granting of rights of pecuniary value;

corporations owned or controlled by foreign governments 
presumptively qualify as foreign States under the Foreign

vest his ownership stake in his businesses; 
Whereas the then-Director of the nonpartisan Office of Gov-
ernment Ethics said that the President’s transfer of his 
business holdings to a trust managed by family members 
is ‘‘meaningless’’ and ‘‘does not meet the standards that 
. . . every president in the past four decades has met’’; 
Whereas Congress has previously given its consent for sitting 
presidents to accept foreign emoluments, after being 
given the opportunity to review the gift; 
Whereas Congress can only give its consent for emoluments 
received by a president if the president provides informa-
tion on the emoluments he has received from foreign 
sources, including the amount, the source, and the cir-
cumstances under which the emolument was received; 
Whereas President Trump has failed to provide Congress the 
opportunity to review any information related to emolu-
ments he has received and continues to receive, denying 
Congress the opportunity to fulfill its duty to review and 
consent to the emoluments;
