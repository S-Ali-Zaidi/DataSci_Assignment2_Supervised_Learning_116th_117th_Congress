SEC. 70310. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING SURPRISE 
1
MEDICAL BILLS. 
2
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
3
(1) Surprise medical bills can be financially dev-
4
astating for consumers. 
5
(2) Surprise medical bills are often unavoidable 
6
and occur in situations where consumers have no 
7
ability to reasonably choose an in-network provider 
8
or insurance company networks are too narrow for 
9
consumers to be able to access seamless in-network 
10
care. 
11
(3) Consumers and their financial stability 
12
should not be caught in the middle between insur-
13
ance companies and health care providers. 
14
(4) It is imperative that Congress enacts a com-
15
prehensive, long-term solution to protect consumers 
16
and end surprise medical billing. 
17
(5) During the COVID-19 pandemic, con-
18
sumers across the country will increasingly require 
19
emergency or unanticipated health care services and 
20
at the same time may have limited access to in-net-
21
work providers due to the increased demand on the 
22
health care system and it is critical that they are not 
23
deterred from seeking care due to the threat of a 
24
surprise medical bill.

(6) The virus is now spreading faster in the 
1
United States than anywhere else in the world and 
2
experts indicate that day by day, more hospital beds 
3
will be full, more resources will be depleted, and the 
4
virus will claim more lives. 
5
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of the 
6
Congress that, during the COVID-19 pandemic— 
7
(1) heath care providers should refrain from 
8
balance billing consumers for out-of-network claims 
9
related to COVID-19 testing or treatment and insur-
10
ance companies should do their utmost to secure ac-
11
cess to in-network treatment for their plan partici-
12
pants, including providing adequate reimbursement 
13
rates for services; and 
14
(2) consumers’ cost-sharing should be limited to 
15
what they would have paid if the providers testing 
16
or treating them for COVID-19 were in-network for 
17
their insurance plan.

(a) FINDINGS.— 
4
(1) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that— 
5
(A) the collection of debts involves the use 
6
of the mails and wires and other instrumental-
7
ities of interstate commerce; 
8
(B) at times of major disaster or emer-
9
gency, the income of consumers is often im-
10
paired and their necessary daily expenses often 
11
increase; 
12
(C) temporary forbearance benefits not 
13
only consumer and small business debtors, but 
14
also other creditors by avoiding downward col-
15
lateral price spirals triggered by an increase in 
16
foreclosure activity; 
17
(D) without forbearance, many consumers 
18
and small businesses are unlikely to be able to 
19
pay their obligations according to their original 
20
terms and are likely to default on obligations or 
21
file for bankruptcy, resulting in reduced recov-
22
eries for creditors, and in the case of bank-
23
ruptcy, no recovery of unaccrued interest;

•HR 6379 IH
(E) with forbearance, creditors are likely 
1
to realize greater long-term value because con-
2
sumers and small businesses will be more likely 
3
to be able to repay their obligations after the 
4
major disaster or emergency has subsided; 
5
(F) the legislative and administrative re-
6
sponse to major disasters and emergencies may 
7
consist of multiple components divided among 
8
different statutes and programs; and 
9
(G) when evaluating whether property has 
10
been taken from a person without just com-
11
pensation, a holistic evaluation of the burdens 
12
and benefits of all legislative and administrative 
13
responses, including indirect benefits from mac-
14
roeconomic stabilization, is appropriate. 
15
(2) FURTHER FINDINGS REGARDING MORTGAGE 
16
FORBEARANCE.—Congress further finds that— 
17
(A) ensuring that consumers are able to 
18
remain in their residences reduces the disrup-
19
tions and economic harm caused by such disas-
20
ters and emergencies by ensuring that con-
21
sumers are able to continue their existing em-
22
ployment, education, childcare, and healthcare 
23
arrangements, which are often geographically- 
24
based;

•HR 6379 IH
(B) temporary forbearance on residential 
1
mortgages is therefore critical to fostering eco-
2
nomic recovery and stability in the wake of 
3
major disasters or emergencies; 
4
(C) temporary mortgage forbearance dur-
5
ing a declared disaster benefits not only mort-
6
gagors, but also mortgagees because mortga-
7
gors’ ability to pay is likely to be restored after 
8
a disaster or emergency subsides, so forbear-
9
ance may increase mortgagors’ total recovery. 
10
Without forbearance, mortgagors are likely to 
11
default or file for bankruptcy, resulting in sig-
12
nificant losses for mortgagees; and 
13
(D) temporary mortgage forbearance dur-
14
ing a declared disaster also benefits the mortga-
15
gees of other properties because housing prices 
16
are geographically and serially correlated so an 
17
increase in foreclosures can drive down the 
18
value of collateral for all mortgage lenders, fur-
19
ther destabilizing the economy.

(3) FURTHER FINDINGS REGARDING MORTGAGE 
21
SERVICERS.—Congress further finds that— 
22
(A) mortgage servicers are often contrac-
23
tually obligated to advance scheduled mortgage 
24
payments to securitization investors, irrespec-

tive of whether the servicer collects the payment 
1
from the mortgagor; 
2
(B) mortgage servicers are often thinly 
3
capitalized and with limited capacity for engag-
4
ing in large scale advancing of payments to 
5
securitization investors; 
6
(C) securitization investors have long been 
7
aware of servicers’ thin capitalization; 
8
(D) in the wake of the 2008 financial cri-
9
sis, several servicers had difficulty obtaining 
10
sufficiently liquidity to make advances; 
11
(E) mortgage servicing is a heavily regu-
12
lated industry; 
13
(F) in response to the 2008 financial cri-
14
sis, Congress created a safe harbor for mort-
15
gage servicers that undertook loan modifica-
16
tions; 
17
(G) in response to the 2008 financial cri-
18
sis, the Home Affordable Modification Program 
19
paid mortgage servicers to undertake loan 
20
modifications;

are or should be aware of servicers’ thin cap-

not have a reasonable expectation that the

terms of servicing contracts will be enforceable

sense of Congress is the following: 
6
(1) The Community Development Financial In-
7
stitutions Fund (the ‘‘CDFI Fund’’) is an agency of 
8
the Department of the Treasury, and was estab-
9
lished by the Riegle Community Development and 
10
Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994. The mission 
11
of the CDFI Fund is ‘‘to expand economic oppor-
12
tunity for underserved people and communities by 
13
supporting the growth and capacity of a national 
14
network of community development lenders, inves-
15
tors, and financial service providers’’. A community 
16
development financial institution (a ‘‘CDFI’’) is a 
17
specialized financial institution serving low-income 
18
communities and a Community Development Entity 
19
(a ‘‘CDE’’) is a domestic corporation or partnership 
20
that is an intermediary vehicle for the provision of 
21
loans, investments, or financial counseling in low-in-
22
come communities. The CDFI Fund certifies CDFIs 
23
and CDEs. Becoming a certified CDFI or CDE al-

Fund programs as follows:

(A) The Bank Enterprise Award Program, 
3
which provides FDIC-insured depository institu-
4
tions awards for a demonstrated increase in 
5
lending and investments in distressed commu-
6
nities and CDFIs. 
7
(B) The CDFI Program, which provides 
8
Financial and Technical Assistance awards to 
9
CDFIs to reinvest in the CDFI, and to build 
10
the capacity of the CDFI, including financing 
11
product development and loan loss reserves. 
12
(C) The Native American CDFI Assistance 
13
Program, which provides CDFIs and spon-
14
soring entities Financial and Technical Assist-
15
ance awards to increase lending and grow the 
16
number of CDFIs owned by Native Americans 
17
to help build capacity of such CDFIs. 
18
(D) The New Market Tax Credit Program, 
19
which provides tax credits for making equity in-
20
vestments in CDEs that stimulate capital in-

2
(F) The Bond Guarantee Program, a 
3
source of long-term, patient capital for CDFIs 
4
to expand lending and investment capacity for 
5
community and economic development purposes. 
6
(2) The Department of the Treasury is author-
7
ized to create multi-year grant programs designed to 
8
encourage low-to-moderate income individuals to es-
9
tablish accounts at federally insured banks, and to 
10
improve low-to-moderate income individuals’ access 
11
to such accounts on reasonable terms. 
12
(3) Under this authority, grants to participants 
13
in CDFI Fund programs may be used for loan-loss 
14
reserves and to establish small-dollar loan programs 
15
by subsidizing related losses. These grants also allow 
16
for the providing recipients with the financial coun-
17
seling and education necessary to conduct trans-
18
actions and manage their accounts. These loans pro-
19
vide low-cost alternatives to payday loans and other 
20
nontraditional forms of financing that often impose 
21
excessive interest rates and fees on borrowers, and 
22
lead millions of Americans to fall into debt traps. 
23
Small-dollar loans can only be made pursuant to

(4) Program participation is restricted to eligi-
3
ble institutions, which are limited to organizations 
4
listed in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue 
5
Code and exempt from tax under 501(a) of such 
6
Code, federally insured depository institutions, com-
7
munity development financial institutions and State, 
8
local, or Tribal government entities. 
9
(5) Since its founding, the CDFI Fund has 
10
awarded over $3,300,000,000 to CDFIs and CDEs, 
11
allocated $54,000,000,000 in tax credits, and 
12
$1,510,000,000 in bond guarantees. According to 
13
the CDFI Fund, some programs attract as much as 
14
$10 in private capital for every $1 invested by the 
15
CDFI Fund. The Administration and the Congress 
16
should prioritize appropriation of funds for the loan 
17
loss reserve fund and technical assistance programs 
18
administered by the Community Development Finan-
19
cial Institution Fund, as included in the version of

•HR 6379 IH
SEC. 160002. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Federal Unions play a critical role in pro-
3
tecting the rights of Federal workers by allowing 
4
members to have a collective voice on the job and in 
5
the legislative process, advance issues for working 
6
families, ensure equal opportunities for all workers, 
7
and raise the standards by which all professional 
8
and technical workers are employed. 
9
(2) Collective bargaining is essential to the 
10
union process, because it provides mutual agreement 
11
between all parties that fosters harmonious relation-
12
ships between the Federal Government and its em-
13
ployees and protects the interest of both parties. 
14
(3) The current administration has acted 
15
through Executive Orders and official memorandums 
16
to dismantle Federal Unions and undermine their 
17
collective bargaining rights across the Federal work-
18
force and these directives have already negatively 
19
impacted labor contracts, both signed and under ac-
20
tive negotiation. 
21
(4) These orders set an aggressive schedule for 
22
unions to engage in collective bargaining, while also 
23
slashing the unions official time for performing 
24
union duties by over 91 percent in some cases. 
25
These actions are limiting the ability for unions to 
26
05:03 Mar 24, 2020
H6379
dlhill on DSKBBY8HB2PROD with BILLS
909 
•HR 6379 IH
prepare for negotiations and perform their legally re-
1
quired employee representational duties. 
2
(5) Section 7101(a) of title 5, United States 
3
Code, states, ‘‘Congress finds that labor organiza-
4
tions and collective bargaining in the civil service are 
5
in the public interest.’’. Attempting to eliminate the 
6
Union by eliminating almost all its official time re-
7
pudiates the statutory position that unions are in 
8
the public interest. 
9
(6) Through these orders, agencies are required 
10
to comply with artificial bargaining schedules, which 
11
undermine good faith negotiations and divert the de-
12
cision-making to an impasse panel, which has no 
13
union representation on it and does not represent 
14
both parties. 
15
(7) Collectively, the administration’s actions 
16
have violated Congressional intent, undermined the 
17
ability of unions to engage in collective bargaining, 
18
and threatened the rights and benefits of millions of 
19
Federal workers.

that were paid, incurred, or reasonably anticipated 
23
by such person, or reasonably reflects the profit-
