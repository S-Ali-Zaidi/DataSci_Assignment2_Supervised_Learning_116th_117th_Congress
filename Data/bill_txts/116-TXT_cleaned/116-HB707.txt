ment of Commerce to provide estimates relating to the 
distribution of aggregate economic growth across specific 
percentile groups of income. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Economic inequality in the United States 
3
has increased dramatically during the 4 decades pre-
4
ceding the date of enactment of this Act, with fewer 
5
households taking home a larger share of the na-
6
tional income. 
7
(2) While growth was once distributed relatively 
8
evenly across all individuals in the United States, re-
9
search shows that economic gains are increasingly 
10
enjoyed by the most affluent. By contrast, the ma-
11
jority of individuals in the United States have seen 
12
income and wage growth significantly below what is 
13
suggested by national measures of output and in-
14
come. 
15
(3) The Bureau of Economic Analysis of the 
16
Department of Commerce (referred to in this section 
17
as ‘‘BEA’’) reports annual and quarterly estimates 
18
of gross domestic product (referred to in this section 
19
as ‘‘GDP’’) in the United States. These estimates 
20
are important measures of the overall size and 
21
health of the economy of the United States but do 
22
not describe how economic gains are distributed 
23
across the population of the United States. 
24
(4) In a country of 325,000,000 individuals, 
25
top-line GDP numbers do not capture the full range 
26

of household economic experiences and may be mis-
1
leading. The real GDP grew more than 3 percent 
2
annually between 2003 and 2005, but the average 
3
income for 1⁄2 of all individuals in the United States 
4
fell during that period. 
5
(5) Disaggregating economic growth by income 
6
groups will provide a more complete picture of how 
7
families in the United States are faring across all 
8
rungs of the economic ladder and whether economic 
9
growth is benefiting all individuals in the United 
10
States. 
11
(6) Recent academic estimates of distributional 
12
growth show how much of the economic gains during 
13
the 40 years preceding the date of enactment of this 
14
Act have accrued to the top of the income distribu-
15
tion. Between 1980 and 2014, the average income of 
16
the top 1 percent of the income distribution grew 5 
17
times as much as the average income of the bottom 
18
90 percent of the income distribution and more than 
19
9 times as much as the average income of the bot-
20
tom 1⁄2. 
21
(7) Official and timely estimates of distribu-
22
tional growth from BEA, reported alongside top-line 
23
GDP numbers, would enable Congress to better

evaluate economic policies that impact every indi-
1
vidual in the United States. 
2
(8) Efforts to address slow wage growth, stag-
3
nant incomes, and growing economic inequality re-
4
quire broadening the focus beyond GDP and obtain-
5
ing metrics that better correspond to the experiences 
6
of all families in the United States.
