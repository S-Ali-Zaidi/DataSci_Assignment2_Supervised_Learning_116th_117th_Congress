RESOLUTION 
Recognizing World Oceans Day and the necessity to protect, 
conserve, maintain, and rebuild our oceans and its resources. 
Whereas the oceans cover more than 70 percent of our plan-
et; 
Whereas the oceans generate the oxygen we breathe, regulate 
our climate and weather patterns, and provide healthy 
meals for people every day; 
Whereas scientists estimate more than 95 percent of the 
oceans remain unexplored;

Whereas the health of our oceans is a reflection of the health 
of our planet; 
Whereas changes in ocean chemistry pose a very real threat 
to marine resources, industries, and jobs; 
Whereas about one-third of the carbon dioxide in the atmos-
phere dissolves into our oceans, causing water chemistry 
to change and become more acidic; 
Whereas our oceans absorb chemical inputs, including carbon 
dioxide from the atmosphere, and the breakdown of or-
ganic matter, and become more acidic; 
Whereas ocean acidification harms oysters, mussels, lobsters, 
clams, corals, and other species building shells, skeletons, 
and reproducing; 
Whereas some finfish lose their sense of smell for identifying 
prey, reproducing, and navigating their habitats in acidic 
waters; 
Whereas, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration, 80 percent of pollution to the oceans 
comes from land; 
Whereas increased temperatures and nutrient runoff can re-
sult in colonies of harmful algal blooms that grow exces-
sively and produce toxins leaving ocean areas and water-
ways in a hypoxic state that threatens marine life; 
Whereas Tribes have a right and a deep cultural and histor-
ical connection to the fish populations threatened by 
changing ocean chemistry; 
Whereas, according to the United Nations, more than eight 
million tons of plastic end up in the oceans each year; 
Whereas marine debris harms our coastal economies, endan-
gers marine life, destroys important marine habitat,

propagates invasive species, and creates hazardous condi-
tions for the maritime industry; 
Whereas tiny pieces of plastic, fiber, fragments, and 
microbeads also make their way into marine life, blocking 
digestive tracts, altering growth, and in some cases kill-
ing animals and marine organisms; 
Whereas marine debris is considered a growing global crisis 
that requires collaborative work with partners from 
across the world; 
Whereas we need to improve our understanding of the impli-
cations of environmental stressors, such as harmful algal 
blooms and hypoxia, marine debris, warming and more 
acidic ocean waters, overfishing, and rising sea levels; 
Whereas these environmental stressors are indicators of a 
changing climate and threaten our economy and the live-
lihood of vulnerable coastal communities; 
Whereas, across the United States, the ocean economy sup-
ports more than 3 million jobs and contributes at least 
$352 billion in economic activity annually; 
Whereas, in 2008, the United Nations General Assembly des-
ignated June 8 as ‘‘World Oceans Day’’; and 
Whereas World Oceans Day provides an opportunity to re-
commit to protect, conserve, maintain, and rebuild our 
oceans and its resources: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, that the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) recognizes World Oceans Day and affirms 
2
the individual and collective duty, both nationally 
3
and internationally, to protect, conserve, maintain, 
4
and rebuild our oceans and its resources;
