SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, 
1
with the European Union as an observer. 
2
(2) The G7 countries are all democracies and 
3
focused on strengthening democratic governance 
4
globally. 
5
(3) In 1997, the G7 invited the Russian Fed-
6
eration to join the group, in recognition of the Rus-
7
sian political and economic reforms underway at 
8
that time. 
9
(4) In 2014, Russia invaded Ukraine and ille-
10
gally occupied Crimea. 
11
(5) In the aftermath of this aggression, the G8 
12
decided to suspend Russia’s membership, issuing a 
13
statement labeling Russia’s invasion a violation of 
14
international law that could have ‘‘grave implications 
15
for the legal order that protects unity and sov-
16
ereignty of all states’’. 
17
(6) In the wake of Russia’s suspension, the re-
18
maining countries reconstituted themselves as the 
19
G7. 
20
(7) Since 2014, Russia has repeatedly inter-
21
fered in democratic elections in G7 countries, includ-
22
ing the 2016 United States presidential election, and 
23
continues to conduct disinformation and covert influ-
24
ence campaigns against many of the G7 countries.

(8) In June 2018, the G7 created the G7 Rapid 
1
Response Mechanism, with the mandate to ‘‘identify 
2
and respond to diverse and evolving threats to our 
3
democracies’’. 
4
(9) Then-Director of National Intelligence, Dan 
5
Coats, testified before Congress on January 29, 
6
2019, that Russia is ‘‘stepping up its campaign to 
7
divide Western political and security institutions’’ 
8
and ‘‘we expect Russia will continue to wage its in-
9
formation war against democracies and to use social 
10
media to attempt to divide our societies’’. 
11
(10) Russia continues to flout the Minsk agree-
12
ments by directly leading and indirectly supporting 
13
separatist forces in Ukraine. 
14
(11) Russia continues to make attempts to 
15
tighten its hold on Crimea by further militarizing 
16
the territory and offering Russian passports to its 
17
residents. 
18
(12) Russia continues to illegally occupy Crimea 
19
and has stepped up its aggressive acts against 
20
Ukraine. 
21
(13) Despite this behavior, President Trump 
22
continues to advocate for an end to Russia’s suspen-
23
sion from the G7 with no preconditions.

5
into a reconstituted G8; and 
6
(2) no official representatives of the United 
7
States Government, including the President of the 
8
United States, should use the power of their office 
9
to advocate for Russia’s readmission into a reconsti-
10
tuted G8 unless Russia meets the conditions de-
11
scribed in section 4(b).
