RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the designation of April 30 as 
‘‘National Adult Hepatitis B Vaccination Awareness Day’’. 
Whereas up to 2.2 million individuals in the United States 
are chronically infected with hepatitis B, and up to two- 
thirds of individuals with chronic hepatitis B are unaware 
of their infection status; 
Whereas hepatitis B is a viral infection of the liver trans-
mitted via infected blood and other body fluids, including 
mother-to-child transmission and transmission through

uals on hemodialysis are at an increased risk for hepatitis 
B co-infection; 
Whereas there is no cure for hepatitis B and individuals with 
chronic hepatitis B require lifelong medical care; 
Whereas chronic hepatitis B represents one of the most com-
mon causes of liver cancer; 
Whereas 1 in every 4 individuals with unmanaged chronic 
hepatitis B will develop liver cancer, cirrhosis, or liver 
failure, with liver cancer only having an 18 percent 5- 
year survival rate in the United States; 
Whereas safe and highly effective vaccines to protect against 
hepatitis B are currently available and infants and chil-
dren have been routinely vaccinated against hepatitis B 
since the 1990s in accordance with universal childhood 
hepatitis B vaccination recommendations in the United 
States; 
Whereas the hepatitis B vaccine, which is 95 percent effective 
and was the first anticancer vaccine to be developed, is 
projected to prevent 310 million cases of hepatitis B 
worldwide from 1990 to 2020; 
Whereas only 25 percent of adults are vaccinated against 
hepatitis B in the United States; 
Whereas the number of reported acute hepatitis B cases in-
creased by 20 percent nationwide in 2015, and there have 
been significant regional increases in acute hepatitis B 
cases in the United States as a result of the opioid epi-
demic, with Maine reporting a 729-percent increase in 
acute hepatitis B infections from 2015 to 2017, Ken-
tucky, West Virginia, and Tennessee reporting a 114-per-
cent increase from 2009 to 2013, southeastern Massa-
chusetts reporting a 78-percent increase in 2017, and

North Carolina reporting a 62-percent increase from 
2012 to 2016; 
Whereas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, hepatitis B is 50 to 100 times more infec-
tious than HIV and 5 to 10 times more infectious than 
hepatitis C; and 
Whereas there are significant opportunities to prevent new 
hepatitis B infections and subsequently reduce the inci-
dence of liver cancer and cirrhosis through efforts to in-
crease adult hepatitis B vaccination and maintain child-
hood hepatitis B vaccination, particularly within the set-
ting of the opioid epidemic: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the designation of ‘‘National Adult 
2
Hepatitis B Vaccination Awareness Day’’; 
3
(2) recognizes the importance of providing sup-
4
port for individuals to be tested for hepatitis B, vac-
5
cinating those susceptible to hepatitis B, and linking 
6
to appropriate care those diagnosed with hepatitis B; 
7
and 
8
(3) encourages a commitment to increasing 
9
adult hepatitis B vaccination rates, maintaining 
10
childhood hepatitis B vaccination rates, and pro-
11
moting provider and community awareness of adult 
12
hepatitis B vaccination in order to reduce the num-
13
ber of new hepatitis B infections and hepatitis B-re-
14
lated deaths.
