RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the duty of the Federal Government to create 
a Green Real Deal. 
Whereas United States greenhouse gas emissions have de-
creased approximately 10 percent since 2005; 
Whereas the United States leads the world in gross emissions 
reductions; 
Whereas a clean energy economy is driven by a national com-
mitment to innovation, competitive markets, and the de-
ployment of advanced energy technologies, and the suc-
cess of this approach is visible in the United States 
where—

(1) energy productivity has grown 14 percent since 
2009; 
(2) the total production of natural gas has increased 
by 56 percent since 2009; and 
(3) the installed wind and solar power capacity has 
quadrupled since 2009; 
Whereas energy prices in the United States are historically 
low, and energy costs make up less than 5 percent of 
total United States personal consumption expenses; 
Whereas, in 2018, United States businesses set records by— 
(1) tripling corporate procurement of clean energy; 
(2) increasing liquified natural gas exports by 135 
percent; and 
(3) increasing sales of electric vehicles by 80 per-
cent; 
Whereas the Department of Defense, on an ongoing basis 
and at the direction of Congress, has identified risks to 
military assets, bases, and national security from climate 
change, and has developed opportunities to reduce green-
house gas emissions and improve national security; 
Whereas 13 Federal agencies, at the direction of Congress 
through the Global Change Research Act of 1990, have 
found that— 
(1) climate change creates new risks and exacerbates 
existing vulnerabilities in communities across the United 
States, and that climate change threatens human health 
and safety, quality of life, and the rate of economic 
growth; 
(2) communities, governments, and businesses are 
working to reduce risks from, and costs associated with, 
climate change, by taking action to lower greenhouse gas 
emissions and implement adaptation strategies; and

(3) while climate change mitigation and adaptation 
efforts have expanded substantially in the last 4 years, 
such efforts do not yet approach the scale considered nec-
essary to avoid substantial damages to the economy, envi-
ronment, and human health over the coming decades; and 
Whereas the House of Representatives recognizes unprece-
dented demand for job-creating, American-made, clean 
energy, and the need to empower individuals and busi-
nesses to come together in the marketplace, as a historic 
opportunity to— 
(1) create millions of good, high-wage jobs in the 
United States; 
(2) enable equal opportunity to achieve unprece-
dented levels of prosperity and economic security for all 
people of the United States; and 
(3) secure the position of the United States as a 
global environmental leader: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-

resentatives that—

(1) it is the duty of the Federal Government to

create a Green Real Deal— 
4
(A) to achieve robust, economy-wide green-
5
house gas emissions reductions; 
6
(B) to create more clean energy options 
7
through a commitment to innovation; 
8
(C) to position the United States as a 
9
global leader in clean energy, driving global in-
10
vestment in American-made clean energy tech-

(2) the goals described in subparagraphs (A) 
13
through (F) of paragraph (1) (referred to in this 
14
resolution as the ‘‘Green Real Deal goals’’) should 
15
be accomplished by—

(A) investing in carbon capture storage 
17
and carbon capture and use, and otherwise re-
18
ducing emissions or achieving net-zero emis-
19
sions from energy produced from fossil fuels; 
20
(B) investing in next-generation low- and 
21
zero-emission energy sources, including renew-
