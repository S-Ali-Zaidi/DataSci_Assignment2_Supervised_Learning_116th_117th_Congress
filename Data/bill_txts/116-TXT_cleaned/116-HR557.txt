(2) control the posture of the head (as in cervical 
dystonia); 
(3) speak (as in spasmodic dysphonia or oromandib-
ular dystonia); 
(4) see (as in blepharospasm); and 
(5) write (as in hand dystonia); 
Whereas there are limited treatments for dystonia, and there 
is currently no cure; 
Whereas dystonia is commonly misdiagnosed, delaying access 
to appropriate medical care for those affected; 
Whereas trauma like that experienced by military service-
members can lead to the onset of dystonia; 
Whereas countless friends, loved ones, spouses, and care-
givers must shoulder the physical, emotional, and finan-
cial burdens that dystonia causes; 
Whereas the severity of the symptoms of dystonia and the 
limited public awareness of the disease cause many pa-
tients to be isolated; 
Whereas National Dystonia Awareness Month will raise pub-
lic awareness and understanding of the disorder of 
dystonia, a disorder affecting people of all ages, races, 
ethnicities, genders, and backgrounds; 
Whereas National Dystonia Awareness Month will also foster 
understanding of the impact the various forms of 
dystonia have on those affected and their families; 
Whereas the dystonia community is uniting to cooperate on 
awareness efforts throughout September; and 
Whereas the Benign Essential Blepharospasm Research 
Foundation, the Dystonia Medical Research Foundation, 
the National Spasmodic Dysphonia Association, and the
