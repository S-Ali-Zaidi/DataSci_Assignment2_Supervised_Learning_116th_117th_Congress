SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. 
1
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) As many colleges and universities across the 
3
country kept their doors closed to African-American 
4
applicants, historically Black colleges and univer-
5
sities (referred to in this section as ‘‘HBCUs’’) 
6
played a central role in ensuring that African Ameri-
7
cans could attain an excellent education. 
8
(2) Today, HBCUs continue to play a critical 
9
role in ensuring that African Americans, and those 
10
of all races, can access high-quality educational op-
11
portunities. 
12
(3) HBCUs enroll nearly 300,000 students, an 
13
estimated 70 percent of whom come from low-income 
14
backgrounds and 80 percent of whom are African 
15
American. 
16
(4) According to the National Association For 
17
Equal Opportunity In Higher Education, HBCUs 
18
make up just 3 percent of American institutions of 
19
higher education but graduate more than a fifth of 
20
African-American college students. 
21
(5) According to the Thurgood Marshall College 
22
Fund (referred to in this section as ‘‘TMCF’’), ap-
23
proximately 9 percent of all African-American col-
24
lege students attend HBCUs.

•HR 1054 IH
(6) A March 2017 report from the Education 
1
Trust concluded that HBCUs have higher comple-
2
tion rates for African-American students than other 
3
institutions serving similar student populations. 
4
(7) In 2014, HBCUs generated a total direct 
5
economic impact of $14,800,000,000 and created 
6
more than 134,000 jobs, according to a study com-
7
missioned by the United Negro College Fund (re-
8
ferred to in this section as ‘‘UNCF’’). 
9
(8) According to TMCF, 40 percent of African- 
10
American Members of Congress and 80 percent of 
11
African-American judges are graduates of HBCUs. 
12
(9) According to UNCF, in 2013, HBCUs 
13
awarded a quarter of all science, technology, engi-
14
neering, and mathematics bachelor’s degrees award-
15
ed to African Americans. 
16
(10) According to UNCF, African-American 
17
graduates of HBCUs are almost twice as likely as 
18
African Americans who graduated from other insti-
19
tutions to report that their university prepared them 
20
well for life. 
21
(b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this Act are— 
22
(1) to strengthen the capacity and competitive-
23
ness of HBCUs to fulfill their principal mission of 
24
equalizing educational opportunity, as described in

3
economic competitiveness priorities of the United 
4
States; 
5
(3) to provide students enrolled at HBCUs with

the highest quality educational and economic oppor-
7
tunities;

(4) to bolster and facilitate productive inter-
9
