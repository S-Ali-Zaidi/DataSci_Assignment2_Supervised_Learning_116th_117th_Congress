SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) An inequity of voting rights exists in the 
3
United States because voters in some States have 
4
the universal right to vote by mail while voters in 
5
other States do not. 
6
(2) Many voters often have work, family, or 
7
other commitments that make getting to polls and 
8
waiting in line on the date of an election difficult or 
9
impossible. Many citizens with disabilities are phys-
10
ically unable to vote due to long lines, inadequate 
11
parking, no curb cuts, steep ramps, and large 
12
crowds. In 2012, 30 percent of voters with disabil-
13
ities had difficulty voting, and more than 5,000,000 
14
voters waited more than an hour to vote. Under cur-
15
rent State laws, many of these voters are not per-
16
mitted to vote by mail. 
17
(3) Twenty-eight States currently allow uni-
18
versal absentee voting (also known as ‘‘no-excuse’’ 
19
absentee voting), which permits any voter to request 
20
a mail-in ballot without providing a reason for the 
21
request. No State which has implemented no-excuse 
22
absentee voting has repealed it. 
23
(4) Three States currently hold elections en-
24
tirely by mail. Twenty-two States currently allow 
25
some elections to be conducted by mail, especially in 
26

•HR 92 IH
large and rural jurisdictions where voting by mail is 
1
especially convenient. Polling stations in rural juris-
2
dictions tend to have higher costs per voter, smaller 
3
staffs, and limited resources. Transportation is often 
4
a crucial barrier for rural voters. 
5
(5) Voting by mail gives voters more time to 
6
consider their choices, which is especially important 
7
as many ballots contain greater numbers of ques-
8
tions about complex issues than in the past due to 
9
the expanded use of the initiative and referendum 
10
process in many States. 
11
(6) Voting by mail is cost effective. After the 
12
State of Oregon adopted vote by mail for all voters 
13
in 1996, the cost to administer an election in the 
14
State dropped by nearly 30 percent over the next 
15
few elections, from $3.07 per voter to $2.21 per 
16
voter. After Colorado implemented all-mail balloting 
17
in 2013, voting administration costs decreased by an 
18
average of 40 percent. The cost of conducting vote- 
19
by-mail elections is generally one-third to one-half 
20
less than conducting polling place elections. Voting 
21
by mail also saves a substantial amount by getting 
22
rid of the temporary labor costs of hiring poll work-
23
ers. In addition to that cost, many jurisdictions have 
24

•HR 92 IH
been facing difficulty in obtaining sufficient numbers 
1
of poll workers. 
2
(7) Allowing all voters the option to vote by 
3
mail can reduce waiting times for those voters who 
4
choose to vote at the polls. In 2016, voters in Ari-
5
zona reported waiting in line from 1 to 5 hours to 
6
vote; in New York, voters reported that stations ran 
7
out of ballots and did not have staff during all of 
8
the hours scheduled for voting. 
9
(8) Voting by mail is preferable to many voters 
10
as an alternative to going to the polls. In 2016, 24 
11
percent of ballots in the United States were cast by 
12
mail, up from 10 percent in 2000. Voting by mail 
13
has become increasingly popular with voters who 
14
want to be certain that they are able to vote no mat-
15
ter what comes up on election day, as it reduces the 
16
physical obstacles and eases the time constraints 
17
connected with the act of voting. 
18
(9) The signature verification process, the 
19
tracking system for each ballot, and postal service 
20
cooperation in preventing ballots from being deliv-
21
ered to names not recognized as receiving mail at an 
22
address nearly eliminate the potential for fraud in 
23
vote-by-mail elections. Evidence of undue influence

or voter coercion after vote-by-mail implementation 
1
in Oregon has been nonexistent to minimal. 
2
(10) Many of the reasons which voters in many 
3
States are required to provide in order to vote by 
4
mail require the revelation of personal information 
5
about health, travel plans, or religious activities, 
6
which violate voters’ privacy while doing nothing to 
7
prevent voter fraud. 
8
(11) State laws which require voters to obtain 
9
a notary signature to vote by mail only add cost and 
10
inconvenience to voters without increasing security. 
11
(12) Many voters choose to cast ballots early 
12
when they have the option (over 50 percent in Ari-
13
zona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Geor-
14
gia, Hawaii, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, North 
15
Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and 
16
Washington). More than 40 percent of voters in the 
17
2016 election cast their ballot before election day. In 
18
Oregon, 7 years after vote-by-mail election imple-
19
mentation, over 80 percent of voters favored the 
20
vote-by-mail system. 
21
(13) Vote by mail typically increases turnout in 
22
all elections, but can be particularly effective in in-
23
creasing voter participation in special elections and 
24
primary elections. Oregon and Washington, the 2 
25

•HR 92 IH
States with the longest standing vote-by-mail sys-
1
tems, continue to have consistently high voter turn-
2
out rates. 
3
(14) A crucial component of a modern voting 
4
system is making it easy, affordable, and accessible 
5
to register to vote. Eighteen States and the District 
6
of Columbia introduced automatic voter registration 
7
legislation in 2015, and Oregon and California now 
8
automatically register their citizens to vote when 
9
they apply for a driver’s license. Automatic, perma-
10
nent voter registration has the potential to increase 
11
participation, protect election integrity, and reduce 
12
registration costs.
