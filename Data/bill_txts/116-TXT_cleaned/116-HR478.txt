RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the designation of Journeyman 
Lineman Recognition Day. 
Whereas journeyman linemen provide a vital service on a 
daily basis; 
Whereas journeyman linemen put their lives on the line every 
day to assure safe and reliable power for the American 
people; 
Whereas journeyman linemen work at heights and in close 
proximity to energized electric lines, and in emergencies 
they often work extremely long hours under sometimes 
dangerous conditions to restore power; 
Whereas Henry Miller, the first elected president of the 
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, was 
killed on July 10, 1896, at just 38 years old; 
Whereas Henry Miller died of injuries sustained while trou-
bleshooting an electrical outage; and 
Whereas there should be a day to honor those industry first 
responders who have given their lives in the line of duty 
along with those who provide skillful service in times of 
local or national crisis: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—

2
Lineman Recognition Day;

(2) honors and recognizes the contributions of

the countless individuals who often place themselves
