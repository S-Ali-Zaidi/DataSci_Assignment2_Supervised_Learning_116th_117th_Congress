Recognizing the 50th Anniversary of the National Oceanic 
and Atmospheric Administration. 
Whereas, on October 3, 1970, the National Oceanic and At-
mospheric Administration (hereafter referred to as 
‘‘NOAA’’) was created to become a world-class science, 
environmental forecasting and ocean resource manage-
ment agency with a reach that goes from the surface of 
the sun to the depths of the ocean floor;

Whereas in 2020, NOAA celebrates 50 years of continued 
dedication to its mission to— 
(1) understand and predict changes in weather, cli-
mate, oceans, and coasts; 
(2) to share that knowledge and information with 
others; and 
(3) to conserve and manage coastal and marine eco-
systems and resources; 
Whereas NOAA’s unique science mission benefits every 
American every day, including by keeping Americans 
safer and healthier and by contributing to the enhance-
ment of the national economy; and 
Whereas in the next 50 years, NOAA will advance innovative 
research and technology, answer critical scientific ques-
tions, explore the unexplored, inspire new approaches to 
conservation, and continue its proud legacy of science, 
service, and stewardship: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) recognizes that NOAA is a global leader in 
2
earth and environmental science and technology to 
3
help us better understand our planet; 
4
(2) recognizes that NOAA is at the forefront of 
5
terrestrial and space weather science and prediction, 
6
providing the public with earlier and more accurate 
7
forecasts, and supporting emergency managers with 
8
impact-based decision support services so commu-
9
nities are informed and prepared for environmental 
10
disasters;
