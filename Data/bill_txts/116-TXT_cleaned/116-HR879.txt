RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
Congress should continue to support the A–10 Thunder-
bolt II attack aircraft, also known as the Warthog and 
A–10C or OA–10C, program. 
Whereas the A–10 Thunderbolt II attack aircraft (hereinafter 
referred to as the ‘‘A–10’’) has seen action in every 
major United States conflict since the first production A– 
10 was delivered to Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in 
October, 1975, and has received several upgrades for the 
281 A–10s remaining in service; 
Whereas since Operation Desert Storm in 1991, the A–10 
has become a preferred close air support platform for 
ground troops;

Whereas the A–10 has been the backbone of the close air 
support mission for more than 40 years and has proven 
to be a highly accurate and durable weapons-delivery 
platform that can be used against all ground targets; 
Whereas the A–10 supports close air support with a variety 
of forward-firing, free-fall, and precision-guided muni-
tions, and performs combat search and rescue, air inter-
diction, armed reconnaissance, suppression of enemy air 
defenses, 
special 
operations 
forces 
support, 
and 
countersea operations in either low- or high-threat envi-
ronments, day or night; 
Whereas the A–10 provides the Air Force an extensive ability 
to survey the battlefield and then fix, engage, target, and 
destroy a wide range of both mobile and fixed targets, in-
cluding tanks and other armored vehicles in quantity, as 
an arsenal aircraft; 
Whereas the A–10 gets pilots back to base despite heavy 
damage from ground fire; 
Whereas the A–10 has the lowest rate of friendly fire inci-
dents of any combat fighter or bomber; 
Whereas the close air support as provided by the A–10 has 
proven invaluable on the battlefield, and it is better than 
any other fighter aircraft for close air support as it is 
simple, effective, and has excellent maneuverability at low 
air speeds and altitude; 
Whereas the A–10 is the least expensive combat plane in the 
United States arsenal to operate and buy; 
Whereas while the A–10 flew only 30 percent of the United 
States Air Force’s total sorties during Operation Desert 
Storm in 1991, these aircraft achieved more than half of

the confirmed Iraqi equipment losses and fired 90 per-
cent of the precision-guided Maverick missiles; 
Whereas during Operation Allied Force in 1999, A–10s de-
stroyed more field-deployed Serbian weaponry than any 
other allied weapon system, and combat search and res-
cue support from the A–10 was 100 percent effective, 
successfully rescuing one F–117 pilot and one F–16CG 
pilot; 
Whereas during Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003 and Oper-
ation Enduring Freedom in 2001, the A–10 flew 32 per-
cent of the combat sorties in both theaters, and from 
2006 to late 2013, flew 19 percent of close air operations 
in Iraq and Afghanistan; 
Whereas the A–10 is an effective close air support platform 
to counter violent extremist organizations such as the Is-
lamic State in Iraq and Syria, having flown 11 percent 
of Air Force sorties against that organization; 
Whereas the demands for close air support in Iraq and Af-
ghanistan keep the A–10 a relevant platform that re-
quires upgrades; 
Whereas if the A–10 is removed from service, certain gaps 
in responsive close air support, forward air controller, air 
interdiction, strike control and reconnaissance, and com-
bat search and rescue support could widen; 
Whereas the A–10 can be serviced and operated with high 
sortie rates from austere bases with limited facilities near 
battle areas, including unprepared dirt, grass, and nar-
row road runways, and from airfields that are too short 
or rough to handle fast jets; 
Whereas to continue providing unmatched airpower, gain and 
maintain air superiority, and extend global reach, global

power is essential to preserving global security and sta-
bility; 
Whereas the A–10 program will support the Air Force, in-
cluding the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve; 
Whereas the A–10 is currently flying in operational combat 
squadrons at Gowen Field Air National Guard Base, 
Idaho, Selfridge Air National Guard Base, Michigan, 
Warfield Air National Guard Base, Maryland, Fort 
Wayne Air National Guard Station, Indiana, Whiteman 
Air Force Base, Missouri, Davis-Monthan Air Force 
Base, Arizona, Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, Eglin Air 
Force Base, Florida, Moody Air Force Base, Georgia, 
and Osan Air Base, South Korea; and 
Whereas the 355th Wing at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, 
with the inventory of 84 A–10s, is responsible for train-
ing and deploying A–10 pilots, whose primary role is to 
support troops on the ground: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) finds that the continued support for the A– 
2
10 Thunderbolt II program is imperative to national 
3
security; and 
4
(2) affirms that Congress should continue to 
5
support the A–10 Thunderbolt II program in future 
6
fiscal years because the United States cannot afford 
7
to risk its security or the security of its allies by al-
8
lowing that program to fall short of its mission.
