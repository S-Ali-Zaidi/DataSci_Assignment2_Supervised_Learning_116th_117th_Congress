RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House that more should be 
done to instill Holocaust education in school curricula 
around the country. 
Whereas more than 70 years after the conclusion of World 
War II, it is even more important now to remember the 
events of the Holocaust and the genocidal pursuits of the 
Nazi regime; 
Whereas troubling numbers of people are ignorant of the 
events of the Holocaust and there are even those who 
deny that the Holocaust occurred; 
Whereas lies continue to be spread with the goal of perpet-
uating racist, xenophobic, and anti-Semitic principles;

Whereas these insensitive beliefs are all too common, and 
only serve to dishonor those that were persecuted, tor-
tured, and killed at the hands of the Nazis; 
Whereas with each passing year we lose some of our greatest 
ambassadors and storytellers as Holocaust survivors age 
and pass away; 
Whereas in the words of Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel, not 
all victims were Jews, but all Jews were victims; 
Whereas many Members of Congress are proud to represent 
large populations of survivors in each of their districts; 
Whereas too many students are graduating with little expo-
sure to Holocaust education and its universal relevance; 
Whereas education about this tragedy is our best defense 
against intolerance and bigotry, and against history re-
peating itself; 
Whereas we are proud that 11 States require by law that 
schools teach students about the Holocaust and the les-
sons that can be learned from that tragic chapter of his-
tory; and 
Whereas Congress has consistently acted to preserve the 
memory of the Holocaust, including establishing a na-
tional Holocaust Remembrance Day in 1978: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That—

(A) commends Holocaust education activ-

Holocaust education in States’ public school
