A BILL 
To establish a United States-Israel Operations-Technology 
Working Group, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘United States-Israel 
4
Military Capability Act of 2020’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress makes the following findings:

•HR 7148 IH
(1) The United States confronts an intense 
1
military technology competition with the People’s 
2
Republic of China and the Russian Federation that 
3
may determine whether the United States can effec-
4
tively deter and defeat adversaries in the future. 
5
(2) On July 11, 2019, Chairman of the Joint 
6
Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley said, ‘‘China is 
7
improving their military very, very rapidly in space, 
8
air, cyber, maritime, land domains, et cetera.’’. Not-
9
ing the rapid technology development by the People’s 
10
Republic of China, General Milley warned that the 
11
United States must ensure ‘‘that we do not lose our 
12
advantages that we have relative to other countries, 
13
specifically relative to China.’’. 
14
(3) The People’s Republic of China and the 
15
Russian Federation have already developed or field-
16
ed some capabilities in areas such as hypersonics 
17
and artificial intelligence that are superior to those 
18
of the United States. 
19
(4) A closer and more systematic early coopera-
20
tive research and development effort with select al-
21
lies may help the United States more quickly and in-
22
expensively restore and sustain military supremacy 
23
in critical military capabilities.

•HR 7148 IH
(5) The innovative and agile defense technology 
1
sector of Israel and the status of Israel as one of the 
2
closest and most reliable allies of the United States 
3
make Israel an ideal candidate for a more systematic 
4
and institutionalized partnership with the United 
5
States focused on early cooperative research and de-
6
velopment. 
7
(6) The defense innovation sector of Israel is a 
8
global leader in many of the technologies important 
9
to Department of Defense modernization efforts. 
10
(7) Despite many laudable ongoing defense 
11
partnership efforts between the United States and 
12
Israel, dangerous United States military capability 
13
gaps continue to emerge that a more systematic and 
14
institutionalized United States-Israel early coopera-
15
tive research and development program could have 
16
prevented. 
17
(8) Such a program would allow the United 
18
States to benefit from the innovation agility and 
19
sense of urgency of Israel, and Israel would benefit 
20
from the economy of scale of the United States. 
21
Such a program could be carefully designed to re-
22
duce the time and cost associated with research and 
23
development, assiduously avoiding anything that 
24
04:10 Jun 28, 2020
H7148
4 
•HR 7148 IH
would slow down or constrain the research and de-
1
velopment of either country. 
2
(9) Belatedly acquiring already produced equip-
3
ment or weapons from Israel to fill a United States 
4
capability gap is not a substitute for a systematic 
5
program that prevents the capability gap from 
6
emerging in the first place. 
7
(10) On March 4, 2020, Secretary of Defense 
8
Mark Esper said, ‘‘We have a very good innovative 
9
base, [the Israelis] have a very good innovative base. 
10
And I think the more we can cooperate together as 
11
allies and partners to come up with common solu-
12
tions, the better.’’. Secretary Esper continued, ‘‘so I 
13
think if there are ways to improve that, we should 
14
pursue it.’’. 
15
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
16
It is the sense of Congress that— 
17
(1) the United States Government has a re-
18
sponsibility to undertake all reasonable measures to 
19
ensure that members of the Armed Forces never 
20
confront a more technologically advanced foe; and 
21
(2) building on positive ongoing efforts, the 
22
United States and Israel should further institu-
23
tionalize and strengthen their defense innovation 
24
partnership by establishing a United States-Israel
