(2) United States Government efforts to protect 
1
and expand freedom of the press and free expres-
2
sion, including online, is in the national interests of

the United States by supporting democracy, pro-
4
moting good governance and public health, miti-
5
gating conflict, and encouraging transparency and 
6
civil society development around the world.

(3) Globally, journalists and media personnel 
8
that receive and impart information and ideas, on-
9

10
censorship, arbitrary detention, torture, enforced 
11
disappearances, extrajudicial killings, and other vio-
12
lence for exercising their right to freedom of expres-
13

versal Declaration of Human Rights and the Inter-
15
national Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
16
(4) Impunity for attacks on journalists and

Saudi Arabia, Dijbouti, Syria, Laos, Turkmenistan,

(6) The Government of Turkey, since a failed 
3
coup attempt in 2016, has used terrorism and na-
4
tional security laws to shutter hundreds of media 
5
outlets and jail dozens of journalists, compounding 
6
the effects of more than a decade of expanding rul-
7
ing party influence over the ownership of main-
8
stream media in the country at the expense of inde-
9
pendent outlets. 
10
(7) The Government of China maintains one of 
11
the most restrictive media and information environ-
12
ments in the world and seeks to control free speech 
13
inside and outside the country through censorship, 
14
onerous media organization registration require-
15
ments, harassment, imprisonment, conditioning of 
16
press credential renewals for foreign journalists and 
17
media personnel and visa issuance for foreign jour-
18
nalists and media personnel on ‘‘positive’’ coverage 
19
of China, and the operation of a digital surveillance 
20
system so pervasive that both routine and sensitive 
21
reporting activities and many aspects of daily life 
22
are subject to government monitoring. 
23

1
media. 
2
(9) Expansion and export of new technologies 
3
used for censorship and digital surveillance rep-
4
resents a notable threat to human rights, including 
5
press freedoms, transparency, and democratic gov-
6
ernance globally, and constitute a critical challenge 
7
to United States national interests. 
8
(10) Other countries’ restrictions on the activi-
9
ties of United States journalists and media per-
10
sonnel, other countries’ censorship and blocking of 
11
websites of United States news and media organiza-
12
tions, and other restrictions on the cross-border flow 
13
of information— 
14
(A) damages the competitiveness of such 
15
organizations and limits access to information 
16
critical for United States investors, consumers, 
17
and others making market and financial deci-
18
sions; and 
19
(B) should be considered a restriction of

SEC. 5. PLAN TO NEGOTIATE RECIPROCAL ACCESS FOR

23
ZATIONS GLOBALLY. 
24
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
25
00:01 Jun 17, 2020
H7001
10 
•HR 7001 IH
(1) United States news and media organizations 
1
and information portals are blocked or censored by 
2
certain foreign governments while the United States 
3
market remains open to websites of foreign news 
4
and media organizations and information portals, in-
5
cluding State-owned propaganda organizations. 
6
(2) The stark lack of reciprocity in market ac-
7
cess for United States news and media organizations 
8
and country access for United States journalists and 
9
media personnel limits constructive contacts between 
10
the United States and the world and allows some 
11
foreign governments unbalanced influence over their 
12
people’s views of the United States and perceptions 
13
in the United States of their policies and programs. 
14
(3) Foreign governments with a sizable media 
15
and information footprint in the United States have 
16
a distinct interest in maintaining that footprint. 
17
(4) Greater quotients of reciprocity in the flow 
18
of news and information will be mutually advan-
19
tageous in United States relations with countries 
20
such as China, Cuba, Eritrea, Iran, Russia, Viet-
21
nam, and Turkmenistan by fostering interactions 
22
that will create greater understanding, trust, and
