Whereas, on January 1, 2020, the Wuhan Public Security 
Bureau questioned eight Chinese doctors who had posted 
information on COVID–19 on WeChat; 
Whereas, on January 1, the Hubei Provincial Health Com-
mission ordered laboratories to stop testing for COVID– 
19 and destroy samples of the same; 
Whereas, on January 2, the Wuhan Institute of Virology 
mapped the genome of COVID–19 in order to inform de-
velopment of public health interventions and medical 
treatments for COVID–19, but the Government of the 
People’s Republic of China withheld genetic information 
on COVID–19 until January 9; 
Whereas, on January 11, the Wuhan Health Commission in-
sisted that there were no new cases of infection by 
COVID–19; 
Whereas, on January 13, the first COVID–19 case outside of 
the People’s Republic of China was announced in Thai-
land; 
Whereas, on January 14, the World Health Organization an-
nounced that the Government of the People’s Republic of 
China had seen ‘‘no clear evidence of human-to-human 
transmission of the novel coronavirus’’; 
Whereas, on January 23, the Government of the People’s Re-
public of China began to implement quarantine measures 
to stem the spread of COVID–19, at the same time as 
the disease had already begun to proliferate throughout 
the world; 
Whereas, on March 11, the World Health Organization de-
clared COVID–19 a global pandemic, with 118,000 per-
sons infected and 4,291 dead in 114 different countries

•HRES 909 IH 
Whereas the Government of the People’s Republic of China 
has argued recently that COVID–19 did not originate in 
the People’s Republic of China; 
Whereas the Foreign Ministry of the People’s Republic of 
China has alleged that the United States Army may have 
delivered COVID–19 to the city of Wuhan in the People’s 
Republic of China; 
Whereas the Foreign Ministry of the People’s Republic of 
China has said, ‘‘China’s endeavor to combating [sic] the 
epidemic has bought time for [international] prepared-
ness’’; and 
Whereas a University of Southampton study found that ear-
lier intervention by the Government of the People’s Re-
public of China could have ‘‘significantly’’ limited the ge-
ographic spread of COVID–19: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) condemns the decision by the Government 
2
of the People’s Republic of China to hide the emer-
3
gence and spread of COVID–19 within its borders 
4
during the initial weeks of the pandemic; 
5
(2) assesses that the decision by the Govern-
6
ment of the People’s Republic of China to hide the 
7
emergence and spread of COVID–19 during that pe-
8
riod almost certainly contributed to the rapid spread 
9
of that disease throughout the Indo-Pacific, Europe, 
10
and the rest of the world; 
11
(3) finds that the Government of the People’s 
12
Republic of China should be held accountable for the

impact of its decision to hide the emergence and 
1
spread of COVID–19 on the lives and livelihoods of 
2
the people of the United States and other nations; 
3
(4) calls for an international investigation led 
4
by public health officials from the United States and 
5
other affected nations to determine how the handling 
6
by the Government of the People’s Republic of 
7
China of the COVID–19 outbreak prior to March 
8
11, 2020, contributed to the emergence of the 
9
COVID–19 global pandemic; and 
10
(5) calls on the international community to— 
11
(A) quantify the harm caused by the han-
12
dling of the Government of the People’s Repub-
13
lic of China to the health and economic well- 
14
being of the people of the United States and 
15
other nations; and 
16
(B) design a mechanism for delivering 
17
compensation from the Government of the Peo-
18
ple’s Republic of China to all affected nations 
19
for the harm caused by its decision to hide the 
20
emergence and spread of COVID–19 during the 
21
initial weeks of the pandemic.
