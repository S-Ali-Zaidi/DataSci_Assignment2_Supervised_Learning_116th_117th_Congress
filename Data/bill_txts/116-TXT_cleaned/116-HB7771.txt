(1) the framers of our Constitution, recognizing 
1
participation in government and freedom of speech 
2
as inalienable rights essential to the survival of de-
3
mocracy, secured their protection through the First 
4
Amendment to the United States Constitution; 
5
(2) the communications, information, opinions, 
6
reports, testimony, claims and arguments that indi-
7
viduals, organizations and businesses provide to the 
8
government are essential to wise government deci-
9
sions and public policy, the public health, safety, and 
10
welfare, effective law enforcement, the efficient oper-
11
ation of government programs, the credibility and 
12
trust afforded government, and the continuation of 
13
America’s representative democracy; 
14
(3) civil lawsuits and counterclaims, often 
15
claiming millions of dollars in damages, have been 
16
and are being filed against thousands of individuals, 
17
organizations, and businesses based upon their valid 
18
exercise of the rights to petition or free speech, in-
19
cluding seeking relief, influencing action, informing, 
20
communicating, and otherwise participating with 
21
government, the electorate, or in matters of public 
22
interest;

Against Public Participation or SLAPPs, are often

ultimately dismissed as groundless or unconstitu-
1
tional, but not before the defendants are put to 
2
great expense, harassment, and interruption of their 
3
productive activities; 
4
(5) it is in the public interest for individuals, 
5
organizations and businesses to participate in mat-
6
ters of public concern and provide information to 
7
public entities and other citizens on public issues 
8
that affect them without fear of reprisal through 
9
abuse of the judicial process; 
10
(6) the threat of financial liability, litigation 
11
costs, destruction of one’s business, loss of one’s 
12
home, and other personal losses from groundless 
13
lawsuits seriously impacts government, interstate 
14
commerce, and individual rights by significantly 
15
chilling public participation in government, public 
16
issues, and in voluntary service; 
17
(7) SLAPPs are an abuse of the judicial proc-
18
ess that waste judicial resources and clog the al-
19
ready over-burdened court dockets; 
20
(8) while some courts and State legislatures 
21
have recognized and discouraged SLAPPs, protec-
22
tion against SLAPPs has not been uniform or com-
23
prehensive; and

(9) some SLAPP victims are deprived of the re-

lief to which they are entitled because the current

bankruptcy law allows for the discharge of fees,

costs and damages awarded against a party for 
4
maintaining a SLAPP.
