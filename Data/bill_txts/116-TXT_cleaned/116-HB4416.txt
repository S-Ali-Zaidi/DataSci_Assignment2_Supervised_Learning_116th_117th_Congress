To authorize the Secretary of Housing and Urban Develop-
ment to award grants to eligible entities to evaluate 
and reduce lead-based paint hazards, lead in drinking

residential real properties. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds as follows: 
2
(1) Lead poisoning is an entirely preventable 
3
environmental illness. 
4
(2) The Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
5
vention has declared that there is no safe level of 
6
lead, with even low-level exposure having lifelong 
7
negative impacts on children. 
8
(3) In 2012, the Centers for Disease Control 
9
and Prevention determined that a concentration of 5 
10
micrograms per deciliter (ug/dL) in blood is the ref-
11
erence level, at which it is recommended that public 
12
health action be initiated. 
13
(4) The American Academy of Pediatrics has 
14
described lead exposure as ‘‘a causal risk factor for 
15
diminished intellectual and academic abilities, higher 
16
rates of neurobehavioral disorders such as hyper-
17
activity and attention deficits, and lower birth 
18
weight in children.’’. 
19
(5) Studies of children with a history of ele-
20
vated blood lead levels at or above 5ug/dL show the 
21
impact over the course of their life, including dimin-
22
ished IQ scores, which lead to lower rates of high 
23
school graduation, lower earning potential, and fewer 
24
Quality-Adjusted Life Years.

•HR 4416 IH
(6) The Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
1
vention has found that children are at higher risk of 
2
lead or lead exposure if they are low-income, a per-
3
son of color, or a recent immigrant, live in poorly 
4
maintained rental properties, or have parents who 
5
are exposed to lead at work. 
6
(7) The primary sources of lead exposure are 
7
dust from chipping and peeling paint found in pre- 
8
1978 homes and water as a result of lead service 
9
lines used to transport drinking water, although lead 
10
has also been found in food, soil, jewelry, pottery, 
11
and other consumer products. 
12
(8) The Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
13
vention has found that about 23,000,000 housing 
14
units, most of them built before 1960, have one or 
15
more lead-based paint hazards, where young children 
16
under age 6 are endangered by chipping or peeling 
17
lead paint or excessive amounts of lead-contaminated 
18
dust. 
19
(9) According to the Centers for Disease Con-
20
trol and Prevention, there were over 88,000 new 
21
cases of lead poisoning in the United States in 2016. 
22
(10) A 2017 study by Pew Charitable Trust in-
23
dicates that removing lead-based paint hazards and 
24
lead service lines from older housing with low-income 
25

H4416

•HR 4416 IH
children results in a combined return on investment 
1
of $2.77 per dollar invested. 
2
(11) The 2019 Interagency Task Force Lead 
3
Action Plan found that a national strategy is re-
4
quired to holistically address lead hazards in hous-
5
ing, drinking water, and soil. 
6
(12) The Federal Government has historically 
7
had a role in assessing and correcting home health 
8
hazards to support the national goal of providing de-
9
cent, safe, and sanitary housing for every family in 
10
the United States. 
11
(13) Standards for lead cleanup funding 
12
should— 
13
(A) align with Federal health and environ-
14
mental recommendations; and 
15
(B) move all States to health-protective 
16
lead exposure prevention and mitigation strate-
17
gies.
