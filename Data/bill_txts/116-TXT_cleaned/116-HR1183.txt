RESOLUTION 
Supporting respect for human rights and encouraging contin-
ued democratic progress in Ethiopia, and for other pur-
poses. 
Whereas the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia has 
been a key ally of the United States and an important 
economic and security partner, as well as a major troop 
contributor to international peacekeeping; 
Whereas, in January 2018, the ruling Ethiopian People’s 
Revolutionary Democratic Front declared that it would 
pursue 
reforms 
in 
response 
to 
intensifying 
antigovernment protests that began in late 2015; 
Whereas Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed spearheaded significant 
and commendable reform measures following his selection 
in April 2018, including releasing thousands of political

prisoners, inviting exiled political opposition back to Ethi-
opia, negotiating a peace agreement with Eritrea, lifting 
bans on over 200 websites and improving media freedom, 
closing the notorious Maikelawi prison, repealing the dra-
conian Charities and Societies Proclamation and the 
Antiterrorism Proclamation, appointing a gender-bal-
anced cabinet, reforming electoral laws and the National 
Electoral Board of Ethiopia, taking steps to privatize the 
economy, and promoting private sector investment; 
Whereas key challenges, including recurring ethnic and inter-
communal clashes and increasingly polarized political 
views that have spurred violence, threaten to impede 
Ethiopia’s democratic progress; 
Whereas ethnic, intercommunal, and intracommunal violence 
since 2017 caused the death of hundreds and displaced 
more than 3,000,000 Ethiopians, including over a million 
people displaced by conflict and violence in 2019 alone, 
according to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Cen-
ter; 
Whereas the COVID–19 pandemic led the Government of 
Ethiopia to declare a state of emergency and indefinitely 
postpone elections originally scheduled for August 2020; 
Whereas the killing of prominent Oromo musician Haacaaluu 
Hundeessaa on June 29, 2020, sparked more than a 
week of violence and arrests, contributing to growing con-
cerns about instability; 
Whereas ethnic and religious minorities were targeted in vio-
lent attacks, and homes, businesses, and religious institu-
tions were looted or destroyed;

•HRES 1183 IH 
Whereas hundreds of people have been killed in the recent 
ethnic violence and unrest, some of them by Ethiopian 
security forces; 
Whereas Ethiopian security forces have arrested more than 
7,000 people since the unrest began, including several 
journalists and prominent opposition politicians, and 
their continued detention has spurred further protests 
and violence; 
Whereas the Government of Ethiopia has employed tactics, 
such as mass arrests, internet shutdowns, and prolonged 
detention without charge, that echo practices used before 
the opening of political space in 2018, threatening the 
democratic progress made over the last 2 years; 
Whereas polarizing narratives and threats of violence en-
dorsed by some members of the opposition and parts of 
the diaspora also jeopardize Ethiopia’s transition to de-
mocracy by raising tensions and increasing the prospects 
for interethnic and interreligious violence; 
Whereas dialogue among the ruling and opposition parties on 
elections and the democratic transition appears to have 
stalled; 
Whereas transitional justice processes and mechanisms can 
help address legitimate grievances, and strengthen secu-
rity, development, reconciliation, and good governance; 
Whereas the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) is 
nearing completion, and is expected to significantly in-
crease Ethiopia’s electricity generation capacity and gen-
erate billions of dollars from energy exports; 
Whereas negotiations surrounding Nile River water rights 
have a long, complex history involving regional and do-
