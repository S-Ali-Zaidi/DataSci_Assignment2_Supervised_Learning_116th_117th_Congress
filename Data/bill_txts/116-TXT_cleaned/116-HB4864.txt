•HR 4864 IH
(1) According to a 2019 report from the United 
1
Nations Inter-Agency Group for Child Mortality Es-
2
timation entitled ‘‘Levels & Trends in Child Mor-
3
tality’’, the total number of deaths among children 
4
younger than 15 years of age dropped by 56 percent 
5
between 1990 and 2018, from approximately 
6
14,200,000 to approximately 6,200,000. 
7
(2) According to a 2016 article published in 
8
The Lancet entitled ‘‘Early childhood development: 
9
the foundation of sustainable development’’— 
10
(A) an estimated 250,000,000 children in 
11
low-income and middle-income countries suffer 
12
suboptimal development due to poverty and 
13
stunting alone; and 
14
(B) children who do not meet develop-
15
mental milestones are expected to lose about 25 
16
percent of their average yearly income once 
17
they become adults. 
18
(3) According to a report from the United Na-
19
tions Children’s Fund (UNICEF), entitled ‘‘The 
20
State of the World’s Children 2016: A fair chance 
21
for every child’’, nearly 250,000,000 of the world’s 
22
650,000,000 primary school age children do not 
23
master basic literacy and numeracy.

•HR 4864 IH
(4) According to a 2018 report from the World 
1
Health Organization entitled ‘‘Nurturing Care for 
2
early childhood development’’— 
3
(A) the environment in which a child grows 
4
has a profound impact on future learning, be-
5
havior, and health; and 
6
(B) a country’s economic diversity and 
7
growth could be improved by investment in 
8
early childhood development. 
9
(5) According to a 2017 UNICEF report enti-
10
tled ‘‘UNICEF’s Programme Guidance for Early 
11
Childhood Development’’, nurturing care, which is 
12
key to early childhood development, consists of a 
13
core set of interrelated components, including— 
14
(A) behaviors, attitudes, and knowledge 
15
about caregiving, including health, hygiene care, 
16
and feeding; 
17
(B) stimulation, such as talking, singing, 
18
and playing; 
19
(C) responsiveness, such as early bonding, 
20
secure attachment, trust, and sensitive commu-
21
nication; and 
22
(D) safety, including routines, protection 
23
from violence, abuse, neglect, harm, and envi-
24
ronmental pollution.

(6) According to a 2016 report published in 
1
The Lancet entitled ‘‘Advancing Early Childhood 
2
Development: From Science to Scale’’— 
3
(A) nurturing care from parents, relatives, 
4
and other caregivers and services are formative 
5
experiences for young children; 
6
(B) programs promoting nurturing care 
7
can improve early childhood development out-
8
comes; and 
9
(C) children who do not receive nurturing 
10
care display negative development outcomes, 
11
such as greater sensitivity to the effects of 
12
stress or behavioral problems, especially chil-
13
dren who do not receive nurturing care before 
14
their second birthday. 
15
(7) According to the ‘‘United States Govern-
16
ment Action Plan on Children in Adversity, A 
17
Framework for International Assistance: 2012– 
18
2017’’, children who live without protective family 
19
care, in abusive households, on the streets, or in in-
20
stitutions, or who are trafficked, are participating in 
21
armed groups, or are being exploited for their labor 
22
are more likely to be exposed to violence, exploi-
23
tation, abuse, and neglect.

(8) According to a 2017 UNICEF report enti-
1
tled ‘‘Early Moments Matter for every child’’, vio-
2
lence, abuse, neglect, and traumatic experiences 
3
produce toxic stress that limits neural connectivity 
4
in developing brains. 
5
(9) According to a 2014 working paper from 
6
the National Scientific Council on the Developing 
7
Child at Harvard University entitled ‘‘Excessive 
8
Stress Disrupts the Architecture of the Developing 
9
Brain’’— 
10
(A) situations that produce toxic stress in-
11
crease the production of cortisol in a child’s 
12
brain, which disrupts its healthy development; 
13
and 
14
(B) chronic stress can potentially affect 
15
the expression of genes that regulate the stress 
16
response across the life course. 
17
(10) According to a 2018 article in the North 
18
Carolina Medical Journal entitled ‘‘Adverse Child-
19
hood Experiences (ACEs): An Important Element of 
20
a Comprehensive Approach to the Opioid Crisis’’, 
21
adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are traumatic 
22
or stressful experiences, including emotional, phys-
23
ical, or sexual abuse, domestic violence, household 
24
substance abuse, household mental illness, parental

(11) According to a 2016 report in Develop-
3
ment and Psychopathology entitled ‘‘Childhood Ad-
4
versity and Epigenetic Regulation of Glucocorticoid 
5
Signaling Genes: Associations in Children and 
6
Adults’’— 
7
(A) children and adults are at risk of de-
8
veloping psychiatric disorders and other medical 
9
conditions if they have had an adverse child-
10
hood experience (ACE); and 
11
(B) adults who have had numerous ACEs 
12
die nearly 20 years earlier, on average, than 
13
adults who have not had numerous ACEs.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
15
It is the sense of Congress that— 
16
(1) it is time to build on the reduction in pre-
17
ventable child deaths worldwide achieved by focusing 
18
new efforts and attention on— 
19
(A) saving children’s lives; and 
20
(B) supporting the healthy development of 
21
children’s brains; 
22
(2) methods of delivering parent training and 
23
education on nurturing care, such as the Center for 
24

and Early Childhood Home Visiting programs, could 
1
help other countries realize greater gains in early 
2
childhood development; 
3
(3) negative early childhood experiences can ob-
4
struct lifelong health and opportunity; 
5
(4) well-developed and inquisitive children are 
6
the global leaders of tomorrow; 
7
(5) countries will only be able to reach and ex-
8
ceed their development goals if their youngest chil-
9
dren get a strong start; and 
10
(6) focused cross-sectoral coordination for pro-
11
moting early childhood development is essential for 
12
the efficiency, effectiveness, and sustainability of all 
13
early childhood development initiatives.
