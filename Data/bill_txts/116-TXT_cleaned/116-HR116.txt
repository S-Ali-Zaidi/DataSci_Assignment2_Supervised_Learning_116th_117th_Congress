RESOLUTION 
Calling for a prompt multinational freedom of navigation 
operation in the Black Sea and urging the cancellation 
of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. 
Whereas, in late February 2014, the Russian Federation in-
vaded and illegally occupied Ukraine’s Crimean penin-
sula, in full contravention of the United Nations Charter 
and the Helsinki Final Act, which condemn the threat or 
use of force as means of altering international borders; 
Whereas the Russian Federation’s attempted illegal annex-
ation of Crimea is also a direct violation of its pledges 
as a signatory to the 1994 Budapest Memorandum on 
Security Assurances to respect Ukraine’s sovereignty and

existing borders and to refrain from the threat or use of 
force against Ukraine; 
Whereas the inclusion of the United States and the United 
Kingdom as signatories to the Budapest Memorandum 
was essential in order to provide Ukraine the security as-
surances needed to give up its nuclear arsenal; 
Whereas, on November 25, 2018, military forces of the Rus-
sian Federation attacked and seized three Ukrainian 
Navy vessels and their crews as they attempted to transit 
the Kerch Strait between the Black Sea and the Sea of 
Azov; 
Whereas the Government of the Russian Federation still has 
not released the Ukrainian crew members or returned the 
Ukrainian ships that were seized illegally; 
Whereas European Commissioner Julian King stated that the 
Government of the Russian Federation launched a 
disinformation campaign over a year ago designed to 
paint Ukraine and NATO as provocateurs in the Kerch 
Strait; 
Whereas, as part of the Russian Federation disinformation 
campaign, Russian state media outlets spread demon-
strable falsehoods, including claims that Ukraine was 
dredging the Kerch Strait seabed to facilitate the sta-
tioning of a NATO fleet, that Ukraine had intentionally 
infected the sea with cholera, and that Ukrainian and 
British clandestine services were conspiring to destroy 
the Kerch Strait bridge with a nuclear weapon; 
Whereas the United States has important national interests 
in the Black Sea region, including the security of three 
NATO littoral states, the promotion of European energy 
market diversification by ensuring unfettered European

access to energy exporters in the Caucuses and central 
Asia, and combating use of the region by smugglers as 
a conduit for trafficking in persons, narcotics, and arms; 
Whereas the Nord Stream 2 pipeline is a proposed under-
water natural gas pipeline project that would provide an 
additional 55,000,000,000 cubic meters of pipeline capac-
ity from the Russian Federation to the Federal Republic 
of Germany through the Baltic Sea; 
Whereas the Russian Federation’s state-owned oil and gas 
company, Gazprom, is the sole shareholder of the Nord 
Stream 2 project; 
Whereas, in 2017, there was spare capacity of approximately 
55,000,000,000 cubic meters in the Ukrainian gas transit 
system; 
Whereas Gazprom cut off natural gas exports to Europe via 
Ukraine in 2006, and again in 2009, over supply and 
pricing disputes with Ukraine’s state-owned oil and gas 
company, Naftogaz; 
Whereas transit of Russian natural gas to Europe via 
Ukraine declined precipitously after the completion of 
Nord Stream 1 in 2011, falling from 80 percent to be-
tween 40 and 50 percent of Russia’s total exports to Eu-
rope; 
Whereas, in 2017, Russian gas accounted for 37 percent of 
Europe’s natural gas imports, an increase of 5 percent 
over 2016; 
Whereas, on December 12, 2018, the European Parliament 
overwhelmingly passed a resolution condemning both the 
Russian Federation’s aggression in the Kerch Strait and 
the construction of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline; and
