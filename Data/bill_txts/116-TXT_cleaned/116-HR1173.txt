Whereas, on September 13, 1993, in Washington, DC, 
Yitzhak Rabin signed the Declaration of Principles 
framework agreement between Israel and the Palestin-
ians, also known as the Oslo Accords; 
Whereas Yitzhak Rabin, along with Shimon Peres and Yasser 
Arafat, received the 1994 Nobel Peace Prize for their ef-
forts to create peace in the Middle East; 
Whereas in his acceptance speech for the Nobel Prize, Rabin 
said, ‘‘We will pursue the course of peace with determina-
tion and fortitude. We will not let up. We will not give 
in. Peace will triumph over all our enemies, because the 
alternative is grim for us all. And we will prevail. We will 
prevail because we regard the building of peace as a 
great blessing for us, and for our children after us.’’; 
Whereas, on October 26, 1994, Yitzhak Rabin and King 
Hussein of Jordan signed a peace treaty between Israel 
and Jordan, saying at the time: ‘‘There is only one rad-
ical means of sanctifying human lives. Not armored plat-
ing, or tanks, or planes, or concrete fortifications. The 
one radical solution is peace.’’; 
Whereas, on November 4, 1995, Yitzhak Rabin was assas-
sinated after attending a peace rally in Tel Aviv, where 
his last words were, ‘‘I have always believed that the ma-
jority of the people want peace, are prepared to take 
risks for peace. . . . Peace is what the Jewish People as-
pire to.’’; 
Whereas Yitzhak Rabin dedicated his life to the cause of 
peace and security for the State of Israel by defending 
his nation against all threats, including terrorism and in-
vasion, and undertaking courageous risks in the pursuit 
of peace;

Whereas in the years following Yitzhak Rabin’s assassination, 
successive United States administrations have sought to 
help Israel and the Palestinians achieve a negotiated two- 
state solution that ends their conflict; and 
Whereas twenty-five years later, the leadership of Yitzhak 
Rabin can be a model for securing peace during a time 
of conflict: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) honors the historic role of Yitzhak Rabin 
2
for his distinguished service to the Israeli people and 
3
extends its deepest sympathy and condolences to the 
4
family of Yitzhak Rabin and the people of Israel on 
5
the 25th anniversary of his death; 
6
(2) recognizes and reiterates its continued sup-
7
port for the close ties and special relationship be-
8
tween the United States and Israel; 
9
(3) expresses support and admiration for com-
10
munity leaders and government officials who work 
11
tirelessly to encourage co-existence and cooperation 
12
between the Israelis and Palestinians; and 
13
(4) reaffirms its strong support for a negotiated 
14
solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict resulting 
15
in two states—a democratic Jewish State of Israel, 
16
and a viable, democratic Palestinian state—living 
17
side-by-side in peace, security, and mutual recogni-
18
tion.
