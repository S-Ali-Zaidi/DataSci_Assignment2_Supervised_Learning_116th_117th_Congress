Congress finds the following:

•HR 3588 IH
(1) In a survey of online peer-to-peer networks, 
1
there is an alarming amount of traffic related to the 
2
online trading and sharing of child sexual exploi-
3
tation material. 
4
(2) Child sexual exploitation, which includes 
5
child pornography, child sexual abuse, and child sex 
6
trafficking is a complex and growing problem that 
7
requires a coordinated, multifaceted response. 
8
(3) Victims of child sexual exploitation are less 
9
likely to self-report or be identified by outside 
10
sources because of their age and the nature of the 
11
crimes committed against them. 
12
(4) Individuals participating in the possession 
13
and trade of child pornography are significantly 
14
more likely to also participate in other forms of child 
15
sexual exploitation, including child sexual abuse and 
16
child trafficking. 
17
(5) The detection of online peer-to-peer trading 
18
of child pornography focuses on images of children 
19
under age 12. Approximately 20 percent of the total 
20
number of child sexual exploitation images discov-
21
ered feature children ages 0 to 4. 
22
(6) The Internet Crimes Against Children Child 
23
Online Protective Services (ICACCOPS) program 
24
has been used to identify and collect evidence for the 
25

purpose of prosecuting offenders online. The pro-
1
gram also catalogues images and creates a digital li-
2
brary for the purpose of identifying victims of child 
3
sexual exploitation through these images. 
4
(7) In 2017, using such program, which scans 
5
the Internet for peer-to-peer trading of child pornog-
6
raphy, law enforcement officials identified 663,853 
7
unique Internet Protocol (IP) addresses associated 
8
with the possession or trading of child pornography. 
9
Each unique Internet Protocol address is associated 
10
with possessing or trading a range of images, with 
11
some possessing more than 50,000 images that de-
12
pict the sexual abuse of children. 
13
(8) Training military criminal investigative or-
14
ganizations on advanced tools is integral to the pro-
15
tection of both military and civilian children. 
16
(9) Continued training on advanced techno-
17
logical tools will allow military criminal investigative 
18
organizations to acquire, adapt, and maintain the 
19
technical skills and knowledge needed to keep up 
20
with the landscape of online child sexual exploi-
21
tation, which is constantly changing as perpetrators 
22
take new steps to avoid detection. 
23
(10) There are existing best practices and mod-
24
els that the Department of Defense should leverage,

including online technologies that can simplify the
