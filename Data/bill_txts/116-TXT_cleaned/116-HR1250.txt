1
potential to improve quality of life for individuals in 
2
the United States, provided it is developed and used 
3
in a manner that is ethical, reduces bias, promotes 
4
fairness, and protects privacy. 
5
(2) A diverse artificial intelligence workforce is 
6
important for mitigating bias. 
7
(3) The United States is uniquely positioned to 
8
leverage its diverse workforce to lead in artificial in-
9
telligence. 
10
(4) The starting point for Federal oversight of 
11
artificial intelligence should be to review existing 
12
regulatory frameworks. 
13
(5) Regulatory sandboxes, in general, refer to 
14
regulatory structures where a participant obtains 
15
limited or temporary access to a market in exchange 
16
for reduced regulatory uncertainty, and can be used 
17
to test a product designed to mitigate unintended 
18
bias or promote fairness in a small-scale environ-
19
ment and under the supervision of regulators. 
20
(6) Federal programs should have necessary 
21
safeguards and oversight processes. 
22
(7) Artificial intelligence regulatory approaches 
23
should consider the level of risk associated with dif-
24
ferent artificial intelligence applications.

(b) MATTERS TO CONSIDER.— 
1
(1) BIAS MITIGATION.—It is the sense of the 
2
House of Representatives that departments and 
3
agencies of the Federal Government should— 
4
(A) support technical and non-technical re-
5
search and development to address potential 
6
bias, fairness, and privacy issues in artificial in-
7
telligence; 
8
(B) improve access to a broad range of 
9
non-sensitive government data assets to help 
10
train artificial intelligence systems; 
11
(C) implement title II of the Foundations 
12
for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018 
13
(Public Law 115–435; 132 Stat. 5529); 
14
(D) develop policies to identify the data 
15
used to train artificial intelligence algorithms as 
16
well as data analyzed by artificial intelligence 
17
algorithms and systems in use by departments 
18
and agencies; and 
19
(E) further develop and release to the pub-
20
lic available benchmark data assets with the 
21
proper safeguards to protect privacy, mitigate 
22
bias, and promote inclusivity.

(2) REGULATION AND LEGISLATION REVIEW.— 
1
It is the sense of the House of Representatives that 
2
congressional committees should— 
3
(A) review the range of existing Federal 
4
regulations and laws that potentially apply to 
5
artificial intelligence; 
6
(B) determine which laws apply to artifi-
7
cial intelligence; 
8
(C) determine if any gaps in appropriate 
9
legislation and regulation exist and how such 
10
gaps could be addressed; 
11
(D) advance Federal privacy reforms that 
12
build trust, prevent harm, and maintain United 
13
States global leadership in artificial intelligence; 
14
and 
15
(E) conduct regular oversight of artificial 
16
intelligence policies in the executive branch 
17
within their jurisdiction. 
18
(3) FEDERAL FUNDING.—It is the sense of the 
19
House of Representatives that Congress should sup-
20
port funding for departments and agencies of the 
21
Federal Government interested in adopting pro-
22
