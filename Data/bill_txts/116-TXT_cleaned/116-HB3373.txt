with Disabilities Act, and this leadership should be 
1
leveraged to support international disability rights. 
2
(2) There are more than one billion persons 
3
with disabilities around the world, and 80 percent 
4

across all sectors, including democracy, human 
8
rights, labor, global health, education, and disaster 
9
relief.

(12) Persons with disabilities are members of 
11
all marginalized groups, including women, young 
12
people, the LGBTI community, ethnic and religious 
13
minorities, internally displaced people, and refugees. 
14
(13) The public presence of the Special Advisor 
15
for International Disability Rights at the Depart-
16
ment of State, first appointed in 2010, helped raise 
17
the visibility of persons with disabilities in Depart-
18
ment policies and programs and improved the inclu-
19
sion of disabilities in the Department’s annual Coun-
20
try Reports on Human Rights Practices and Traf-
