A BILL 
To allow Americans to earn paid sick time so that they 
can address their own health needs and the health needs 
of their families. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Healthy Families Act’’. 
4
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
5
Congress makes the following findings: 
6
(1) Working people need time to meet their own 
7
health care needs and to care for family members. 
8
The absence of paid sick time has forced working 
9
people to make untenable choices between needed in-
10
come and jobs on the one hand and caring for their 
11
own and their family’s health on the other. It is in 
12
the national interest to ensure that all working peo-
13
ple can care for their own health and the health of 
14
their families while prospering at work. 
15
(2) Twenty-nine percent of the private sector 
16
workforce and 9 percent of the public sector work-
17
force lack paid sick time. Millions more theoretically 
18

•HR 1784 IH
have access to sick time, but have not been on the 
1
job long enough to use it. Millions more lack sick 
2
time they can use to care for a sick child or ill fam-
3
ily member. 
4
(3) Working people without paid sick days are 
5
more likely to go to work sick and delay or forgo 
6
needed health care. A 2016 study in the journal 
7
Health Affairs found that working adults without 
8
paid sick days are 3 times more likely to forgo med-
9
ical care for themselves, and 1.6 times more likely 
10
to forgo medical care for their family, compared to 
11
working adults with paid sick days. Lack of paid 
12
sick days is also a barrier to receiving annual health 
13
screenings and preventive care, according to a 2017 
14
study in the American Journal of Nursing. 
15
(4) Nearly 1 in 4 parents without paid sick 
16
time reports sending a sick child to school or child 
17
care because the parent has to go to work. When 
18
children go to school and child care sick, they risk 
19
their own health and that of other children, teach-
20
ers, and administrators. Research suggests that 
21
schools play a key role in transmitting contagious ill-
22
nesses like influenza. 
23
(5) A 2012 study published in the American 
24
Journal of Public Health found that a lack of work-
25
02:37 Apr 02, 2019
H1784
4 
•HR 1784 IH
place policies like paid sick days contributed to an 
1
additional 5,000,000 cases of influenza-like illness 
2
during the H1N1 pandemic of 2009. 
3
(6) A National Bureau of Economic Research 
4
analysis examining influenza rates following the im-
5
plementation of comprehensive paid sick time laws 
6
in 7 major cities in the United States found that 
7
when workers gained access to paid sick time in 
8
those cities, the general influenza rate in the popu-
9
lation decreased by 5.5 to 6.5 percent. This analysis 
10
estimates that those laws helped prevent about 100 
11
influenza-like infections per week for every 100,000 
12
people. 
13
(7) Paid sick days contribute to more cost-effec-
14
tive use of health care resources. A 2011 study by 
15
the Institute for Women’s Policy Research found 
16
that a universal paid sick days policy would reduce 
17
preventable visits to the emergency room and result 
18
in cost savings of $1,100,000,000 per year, includ-
19
ing $500,000,000 in savings for public health insur-
20
ance programs like Medicare and Medicaid. 
21
(8) The American Productivity Audit completed 
22
in 2003 found that lost productivity due to illness 
23
costs $226,000,000,000 ($308,000,000,000 in 2019 
24
dollars) annually, and that 71 percent of that cost 
25
02:37 Apr 02, 2019
H1784

•HR 1784 IH
stems from presenteeism—the practice of employees 
1
coming to work while ill. Studies in the Journal of 
2
Occupational and Environmental Medicine and the 
3
Journal of the American Medical Association show 
4
that presenteeism is a larger productivity drain than 
5
either absenteeism or short-term disability. 
6
(9) Working while sick also increases a worker’s 
7
probability of suffering an injury on the job. A 2012 
8
study published by the American Journal of Public 
9
Health found that workers with access to paid sick 
10
leave were 28 percent less likely than workers with-
11
out paid sick leave to suffer nonfatal occupational 
12
injuries. 
13
(10) Workers’ access to paid sick time varies 
14
dramatically by wage level, as demonstrated by the 
15
following: 
16
(A) For private sector workers— 
17
(i) for workers in the lowest quartile 
18
of earners, 55 percent lack paid sick time; 
19
(ii) for workers in the next 2 quar-
20
tiles, 27 and 17 percent, respectively, lack 
21
paid sick time; and 
22
(iii) even for workers in the highest 
23
quartile, 10 percent lack paid sick time. 
24
(B) For public sector workers— 
25
02:37 Apr 02, 2019
H1784
6 
•HR 1784 IH
(i) for workers in the lowest quartile 
1
of earners, 21 percent lack paid sick time; 
2
(ii) for workers in the next 2 quar-
3
tiles, 5 and 3 percent, respectively, lack 
4
paid sick time; and 
5
(iii) for workers in the highest quar-
6
tile, 5 percent lack paid sick time. 
7
(11) Workers’ access to paid sick days also var-
8
ies depending on their occupation and race. For ex-
9
ample, more than 80 percent of workers in food 
10
preparation and serving occupations lack access to 
11
paid sick days, compared to only 23 percent of work-
12
ers in management occupations. More than half of 
13
Latino workers and nearly half of Native American 
14
or Alaskan Native workers do not have access to 
15
paid sick days, compared to nearly 40 percent of 
16
White and Black workers. 
17
(12) According to the Centers for Disease Con-
18
trol and Prevention, more than 1 in 3 women and 
19
more than 1 in 4 men in America report having ex-
20
perienced rape, physical abuse, or some form of un-
21
wanted sexual contact at some point in their lives. 
22
Women and men of color are even more likely to re-
23
port being impacted by intimate partner violence. 
24
Too many people, and especially women, are forced 
25
02:37 Apr 02, 2019
H1784
7 
•HR 1784 IH
to risk losing their jobs or critical income when they 
1
need to take time away from work to address domes-
2
tic-violence-related issues, such as obtaining a re-
3
straining order or finding housing, in order to avoid 
4
or prevent physical or sexual abuse. 
5
(13) Without paid sick time that can be used 
6
to address the effects of domestic violence, these vic-
7
tims are in grave danger of losing their jobs. In a 
8
2018 survey of domestic violence survivors, nearly 3⁄4 
9
(73 percent) reported that financial problems forced 
10
them to remain with their abusers longer than they 
11
wanted or to return to their abusers after having 
12
left, and more than half (53 percent) said they lost 
13
a job because of the abuse. The loss of employment 
14
can be particularly devastating for victims of domes-
15
tic violence, who often need economic security to en-
16
sure safety. 
17
(14) The Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
18
vention has estimated that intimate partner violence 
19
costs over $700,000,000 annually due to the victims’ 
20
lost productivity in employment. 
21
(15) A 2018 study published in the American 
22
Journal of Orthopsychiatry found that workers with-
23
out paid sick leave benefits have higher levels of psy-
24
chological distress and are 1.45 times more likely to 
25
02:37 Apr 02, 2019
H1784
8 
•HR 1784 IH
report that their distress symptoms interfere ‘‘a lot’’ 
1
with their daily life activities. 
2
(16) Efforts to assist abused employees result 
3
in positive outcomes for employers as well as em-
4
ployees because employers can retain workers who 
5
might otherwise be compelled to leave. 
6
(17) Dozens of States, cities, and localities have 
7
or will soon have paid sick time laws in place and 
8
evidence shows that those laws are working well for 
9
workers, businesses, and the economy. 
10
(18) A 2009 study by the Center for Economic 
11
and Policy Research found that, of 22 countries with 
12
comparable economies, the United States was 1 of 
13
only 3 countries that did not provide any paid time 
14
off for workers with short-term illnesses. 
15
SEC. 3. PURPOSES. 
16
The purposes of this Act are— 
17
(1) to ensure that working people can address 
18
their own health needs and the health needs of their 
19
families by requiring employers to permit employees 
20
to earn up to 56 hours of paid sick time including 
21
paid time for family care; 
22
(2) to diminish public and private health care 
23
costs by enabling workers to seek early and routine 
24
health care for themselves and their family members; 
25
02:37 Apr 02, 2019
H1784
9 
•HR 1784 IH
(3) to assist employees who are, or whose fam-
1
ily members are, victims of domestic violence, sexual 
2
assault, or stalking, by providing the employees with 
3
paid time away from work to allow the victims to re-
4
ceive treatment and to take the necessary steps to 
5
ensure their protection; 
6
(4) to address the historical and persistent 
7
widespread pattern of employment discrimination on 
8
the basis of gender by both private and public sector 
9
employers; 
10
(5) to accomplish the purposes described in 
11
paragraphs (1) through (4) in a manner that is fea-
12
sible for employers; and 
13
(6) consistent with the provision of the 14th 
14
Amendment to the Constitution relating to equal 
15
protection of the laws, and pursuant to Congress’ 
16
power to enforce that provision under section 5 of 
17
that Amendment— 
18
(A) to accomplish the purposes described 
19
in paragraphs (1) through (4) in a manner that 
20
minimizes the potential for employment dis-
21
crimination on the basis of sex by ensuring gen-
22
erally that paid sick time is available for eligible 
23
medical reasons on a gender-neutral basis; and
