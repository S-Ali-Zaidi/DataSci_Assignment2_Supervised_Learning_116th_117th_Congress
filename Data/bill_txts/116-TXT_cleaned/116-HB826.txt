SEC. 4. FINDINGS. 
9
Congress finds the following: 
10
(1) The World Health Organization (WHO) has 
11
identified 17 neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). 
12
Approximately two billion people—almost one-third 
13
of the world’s population—are at risk of contracting 
14
an NTD, and more than 1.4 billion people are cur-
15
rently afflicted with one or more NTDs. 
16
23:59 Feb 05, 2019

•HR 826 IH
(2) In 2013, WHO adopted a comprehensive 
1
resolution on NTDs recognizing that increased na-
2
tional and international investments in prevention 
3
and control of neglected tropical diseases have suc-
4
ceeded in improving health and social well-being in 
5
many countries. 
6
(3) NTDs have an enormous impact in terms of 
7
disease burden and quality of life. NTDs cause the 
8
loss of up to 534,000 lives and 57 million disability- 
9
adjusted life years each year. NTDs surpass both 
10
malaria and tuberculosis in causing greater loss of 
11
life-years to disability and premature death. Many 
12
NTDs cause disfigurement and disability, leading to 
13
stigma, social discrimination, and societal marginali-
14
zation. 
15
(4) NTDs create an economic burden of billions 
16
of dollars through the loss of productivity and high 
17
costs of health care required for treatment. People 
18
afflicted by NTDs are less productive than their 
19
healthy counterparts. NTDs jeopardize the ability of 
20
people to attend work and school, or to produce at 
21
full capacity. For example, controlling one NTD, 
22
hookworm, in children can result in a 43-percent in-
23
crease in future wage earnings. 
24
23:59 Feb 05, 2019
H826

•HR 826 IH
(5) The social, economic, and health burden of 
1
NTDs falls primarily on low- and middle-income 
2
countries, where access to safe water, sanitation, 
3
and health care is limited. At least 100 countries 
4
face two endemic NTD burdens, and 30 countries 
5
carry six or more endemic NTDs. 
6
(6) NTDs are not confined to the developing 
7
world, however. Several NTD outbreaks have been 
8
reported in the United States and other developed 
9
countries, especially among the poor. In the United 
10
States, NTDs disproportionately affect people living 
11
in poverty, and especially minorities, including up to 
12
2.8 million African Americans with toxocariasis and 
13
300,000 or more people, mostly Hispanic Americans, 
14
with Chagas disease. 
15
(7) In 2014, an outbreak of Ebola Virus Dis-
16
eases (Ebola) caused a pandemic that infected more 
17
than 20,000 people, including more than 8,000 
18
deaths. Although not listed as an NTD by the World 
19
Health Organization, Ebola shares the same charac-
20
teristics as other NTDs by affecting people living 
21
‘‘under conditions of poverty’’ and is ‘‘concentrated 
22
almost exclusively in impoverished populations in the 
23
developing world’’. Even when the disease had 
24
spread to the United States and other developed 
25
23:59 Feb 05, 2019
H826

•HR 826 IH
countries, it was contained and controlled by the 
1
well-equipped health systems in those areas. 
2
(8) Many NTDs can be controlled, prevented, 
3
and even eliminated using low-cost, effective, and 
4
feasible solutions. Understanding the economic bur-
5
den of NTDs on productivity and health care costs 
6
can help to assure governments and donors that the 
7
resources directed toward NTDs represent a good 
8
investment. 
9
(9) Research and development efforts are imme-
10
diately needed for all NTDs, especially those for 
11
which limited or no treatment currently exists. 
12
(10) Critical to developing robust NTD control 
13
strategies are epidemiological data that identify at- 
14
risk populations, ensure appropriate treatment fre-
15
quency, and inform decisions about when treatment 
16
can be reduced or stopped. 
17
(11) Of the 14 most common NTDs, roughly 
18
80 percent of infections are caused by soil-trans-
19
mitted helminths (STH) and schistosomiasis. STH 
20
are a group of three parasitic worms (roundworms, 
21
whipworms, and hookworms) that afflict more than 
22
one billion people worldwide, including 600 million 
23
school-age children, of whom more than 300 million 
24
suffer from severe morbidity. Schistosomiasis is an-
25
23:59 Feb 05, 2019
H826
6 
•HR 826 IH
other helminth infection affecting at least 200 mil-
1
lion people in developing countries, but some esti-
2
mates indicate that the true number of people af-
3
fected may be double or even triple that number. 
4
(12) The main health problems caused by STH 
5
are related to their negative effect on childhood nu-
6
tritional status, which can cause stunting and wast-
7
ing. For example, STH infection may lead to ane-
8
mia, malabsorption of nutrients, loss of appetite, 
9
nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and reduced food 
10
intake. When such health problems are experienced 
11
in early childhood, a peak growth and development 
12
period, the mental and physical damage—and loss of 
13
future productivity and wage-earning potential—will 
14
likely be irreversible. Schistosomiasis causes end- 
15
organ damage to the urinary tract, female genital 
16
tract, liver and intestines. It also results in chronic 
17
health conditions in children. 
18
(13) STH and schistosomiasis are also particu-
19
larly detrimental to the health of women of repro-
20
ductive age and pregnant women. Their underlying 
21
poor iron status makes these women most suscep-
22
tible to developing anemia. Iron deficiency anemia 
23
resulting from hookworm infection during pregnancy 
24
has been linked to poor pregnancy outcomes such as 
25
23:59 Feb 05, 2019
H826
7 
•HR 826 IH
prematurity, low birth weight, and impaired lacta-
1
tion. Female genital schistosmiasis may be one of 
2
the most common gynecologic conditions in Africa 
3
leading to genital pain, itching, and bleeding and 
4
markedly increased susceptibility to HIV/AIDS. 
5
(14) Fortunately, there is a simple, cost-effec-
6
tive solution to STH and schistosomiasis infections: 
7
single-dose deworming pills that can be safely ad-
8
ministered once or twice annually to those at risk. 
9
Pharmaceutical companies have committed to donate 
10
the drugs needed to treat all at-risk, school-age chil-
11
dren in developing countries. Regular administration 
12
of deworming pills reduces morbidity associated with 
13
STH and schistosomiasis infections by reducing 
14
prevalence and transmission rates. 
15
(15) Improved access to water, sanitation, and 
16
hygiene (WASH) can also reduce the transmission of 
17
NTDs, particularly intestinal worms. 
18
(16) The benefits of deworming are immediate 
19
and enduring. A rigorous randomized controlled trial 
20
has shown school-based deworming treatment to re-
21
duce school absenteeism by 25 percent. School-based 
22
deworming also benefits young siblings and other 
23
children who live nearby but are too young to be

SEC. 101. EXPANSION OF UNITED STATES AGENCY FOR 
14
INTERNATIONAL 
DEVELOPMENT’S 
NE-
15
GLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES PROGRAM. 
16
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
17
(1) Since fiscal year 2006, the United States 
18
Government has been an essential leading partner in 
19
advancing control and elimination efforts for seven 
20
targeted neglected tropical diseases: lymphatic fila-
21
riasis (elephantiasis), onchocerciasis (river blind-
22
ness), schistosomiasis, soil-transmitted helminthiases 
23
(STH) (round worm, whip worm, and hook worm), 
24
and trachoma. Additional information suggests that 
25
23:59 Feb 05, 2019
H826
10 
•HR 826 IH
such efforts could also produce collateral benefits for 
1
at least three other NTDs: foodborne trematodiases, 
2
scabies, and yaws (endemic treponematoses). 
3
(2) The United States Agency for International 
4
Development’s (USAID) Neglected Tropical Dis-
5
eases Program has made important and substantial 
6
contributions to the global fight to control and elimi-
7
nate the seven most common NTDs. Leveraging 
8
more than $6.7 billion in donated medicines, USAID 
9
has supported the distribution of more than one bil-
10
lion treatments in 25 countries across Africa, Asia, 
11
and Latin America and the Caribbean. 
12
(3) United States Government leadership has 
13
been instrumental in maintaining the global fight 
14
against NTDs and is a partner in the London Dec-
15
laration on Neglected Tropical Diseases (2012), 
16
which represents a new, coordinated international 
17
push to accelerate progress toward eliminating or 
18
controlling 10 neglected tropical diseases by 2020. 
19
(4) USAID’s Neglected Tropical Diseases Pro-
20
gram is a clear example of a successful public-pri-
21
vate partnership between the Government and the 
22
private sector and should be judiciously expanded, as 
23
practicable and appropriate. 
24
23:59 Feb 05, 2019
H826
11 
•HR 826 IH
(5) While many of the most common NTDs 
1
have treatments that are safe, easy to use, and effec-
2
tive, treatment options for NTDs with the highest 
3
death rates, including human African trypanosomia-
4
sis, visceral leishmaniasis, and Chagas disease, are 
5
extremely limited. 
6
(6) Since 2014, USAID’s Neglected Tropical 
7
Diseases Program has been investing in gathering 
8
research on treatment for certain NTDs to ensure 
9
that promising new breakthrough medicines can be 
10
rapidly evaluated, registered, and made available to 
11
patients. 
12
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
13
gress that USAID’s Neglected Tropical Diseases Program 
14
should— 
15
(1) provide integrated drug treatment packages 
16
to as many individuals suffering from NTDs or at 
17
risk of acquiring NTDs as logistically feasible; 
18
(2) better integrate control and treatment tools 
19
and approaches for NTDs into complementary devel-
20
opment and global health programs by coordinating 
21
across multiple sectors, including sectors relating to 
22
HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other infectious diseases 
23
and development sectors relating to education (in-
24
cluding primary and pre-primary education), food

and nutrition security, maternal and child health, 
1
and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH), as 
2
practicable and appropriate; 
3
(3) establish low-cost, high-impact community 
4
and school-based NTD programs to reach large at- 
5
risk populations, including school-age children who 
6
require treatments for NTDs, with integrated drug 
7
treatment packages as feasible; 
8
(4) for other NTDs, such as human African 
9
trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness), Chagas disease, 
10
leishmaniasis, and dengue fever, engage in research 
11
and development of new tools and approaches to 
12
reach the goals relating to the elimination of NTDs 
13
as set forth in the World Health Organization’s ‘‘Ac-
14
celerating Work to Overcome the Global Impact of 
15
Neglected Tropical Diseases: A Roadmap for Imple-
16
mentation’’ (2012), as opportunities emerge and re-
17
sources allow; and 
18
(5) monitor the research on and developments 
19
in the prevention and treatment of other NTDs so 
20
they can be incorporated into the program, as prac-
21
ticable and appropriate. 
22
(c) PROGRAM PRIORITIES.—The Administrator of 
23
USAID should incorporate the following priorities into 
24
USAID’s Neglected Tropical Diseases Program: 
25
23:59 Feb 05, 2019

17
emerge, to the extent practicable and appropriate. 
18
(5) Continuing investments in research and de-
19
velopment for new tools, including diagnostics, 
20
drugs, and vaccines, for NTDs to ensure that new 
21
discoveries make it through the pipeline and become 
22
available to individuals who need them most.
