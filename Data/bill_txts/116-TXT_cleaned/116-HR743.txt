RESOLUTION 
Expressing strong disapproval of the President’s formal noti-
fication to the United Nations of his intent to withdraw 
the United States from the Paris Agreement. 
Whereas global climate change is a threat to the United 
States national security, public health, national economy, 
and the legacy we will leave to our children; 
Whereas there is expert-level consensus within the Federal 
Government, from the intelligence community and De-
partment of Defense to the Department of Agriculture, 
Department of Transportation, and the National Oceanic 
and Atmospheric Administration, that climate change is 
real, already affecting the United States, and poses a dire 
threat to our well-being and security if left unaddressed; 
Whereas on November 23, 2018, the U.S. Global Change Re-
search Program, a collaboration of thirteen Federal agen-
cies, released Volume II of its Fourth National Climate 
Assessment (NCA4) outlining the impact climate change 
will have on human and societal welfare, including re-
gion-specific effects, and issues affecting natural resource 
management, public health, emergency response, and 
other critical issues to national well-being;

Whereas NCA4 makes clear that communities around the 
country are already facing climate-driven impacts on 
human health such as extreme heat, expanded exposure 
to vector-borne diseases, poor air quality, and weather 
events that are displacing communities; 
Whereas NCA4 found that reducing greenhouse gas emis-
sions could, by the end of the century, result in thou-
sands of American lives saved and hundreds of billions of 
dollars in health-related economic benefits gained each 
year; 
Whereas NCA4 highlighted that already-aging United States 
infrastructure, from stormwater management to the elec-
trical grid, would be stretched to its limit in the face of 
Federal inaction toward combating climate change; 
Whereas on May 6, 2019, the United Nations Intergovern-
mental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Eco-
system Services (IPBES) released its updated Global As-
sessment, which found that around one million species, 1 
in 4, are at risk of extinction as a result of climate 
change; 
Whereas the IPBES Global Assessment found that the reduc-
tion in global biodiversity that is driven by climate 
changes threatens global food security, and the NCA4 
notes that climate change is expected to disrupt United 
States agricultural productivity and threaten domestic 
crop yields; 
Whereas the United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Gon-
zalez stated at the opening of the United Nations Climate 
Change Conference COP25, that ‘‘choosing the path of 
hope is not the job of one person, one industry or one 
government alone . . . the only solution is rapid, ambi-

tious, transformative action by all—governments, regions, 
cities, businesses and civil society’’, and that ‘‘we made 
a commitment to the people of the world through the 
Paris Agreement. It was a solemn promise . . . to do 
anything less will be a betrayal of our entire human fam-
ily and all the generations to come.’’; 
Whereas the World Meteorological Organization’s Provisional 
Statement on the State of the Global Climate in 2019, 
released on December 3, 2019, stated that 2019 ends the 
warmest decade on record and that greenhouse gas con-
centrations have reached a record new high of 407.8 
parts per million; 
Whereas the United Nations Environment Programme’s 
Emissions Gap Report 2019, released in November 2019, 
highlighted the significant work the global community 
must undertake in order to overcome the shortcomings of 
current commitments to keep global temperature rise to 
two degrees Celsius, that greenhouse gas emissions con-
tinued to increase in 2019, that G20 countries account 
for more than 75 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, 
and that ‘‘enhanced action by G20 members will be es-
sential for the global mitigation effort’’; 
Whereas the most vulnerable communities, including commu-
nities of color, women, children, the elderly, persons with 
disabilities, low-income communities, and those with un-
derlying health conditions, face even greater health risks 
as a result of climate change; 
Whereas the United States is already seeing climate change 
exacerbate extreme weather events, including 6 Category 
5 hurricanes in the past 4 years, the issuance of the first- 
ever Extreme Red Flag Warning for wildfires, and com-

munities around the country regularly facing ‘‘100 Year 
Floods’’; 
Whereas investing in energy efficiency and clean energy tech-
nologies is an extraordinary job creation opportunity for 
the United States that already employs more than 
3,260,000 people, with solar and wind technicians rep-
resenting the first and second fastest-growing jobs in the 
entire United States economy by 2026, respectively; 
Whereas the United States can lead the world in innovation 
and manufacturing clean energy technologies, creating 
good-paying jobs, modernizing the energy grid, and grow-
ing new companies that will be the titans of a new clean 
energy economy; 
Whereas the Paris Agreement highlights the importance of 
environmental justice and equity in our climate solutions, 
particularly in light of the impact climate change is ex-
pected to have on vulnerable communities around the 
globe; 
Whereas the Paris Agreement is an international accord that 
aims to limit the increase in global temperatures to less 
than two degrees Celsius and urges efforts to limit the 
increase to one and a half degrees Celsius above pre-in-
dustrial levels; 
Whereas the Paris Agreement was adopted on December 12, 
2015, opened for signature on April 22, 2016, and en-
tered into force on November 4, 2016; 
Whereas 197 parties are signatories and 187 are officially 
party to the Paris Agreement, including the largest 
emitters of carbon pollution, China, the European Union, 
and India;

Whereas if the United States withdrew from the Paris Agree-
ment, it would be the only nation in the world to do so; 
Whereas the United States, as one of the world’s top emitters 
of carbon pollution, has an obligation to participate in 
global efforts to curb climate change; 
Whereas the United States exit from the Paris Agreement 
will cede leadership on clean energy technologies, and the 
jobs they create, to China, India, and other nations; 
Whereas a group of States, including California, Colorado, 
Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Mary-
land, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Ne-
vada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Caro-
lina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Vir-
ginia, Washington, Wisconsin, and the territory of Puerto 
Rico, have all joined the United States Climate Alliance, 
a bipartisan group of States committed to upholding the 
goals of the Paris Agreement; 
Whereas more than 3,800 mayors, college and university 
leaders, businesses, and investors in the United States 
announced their continued support for the Paris Agree-
ment; 
Whereas leaders of the world’s religious communities recog-
nize the grave threat to humanity posed by climate 
change and our moral obligation to protect the earth and 
its people publicly have called upon politicians, business 
leaders, and the faithful to take action to address climate 
change; and 
Whereas millions of Americans have made their voices heard 
in support of the Paris Agreement, and the United States 
upholding its commitments to the international commu-
nity to reduce carbon pollution for the benefit of good-
