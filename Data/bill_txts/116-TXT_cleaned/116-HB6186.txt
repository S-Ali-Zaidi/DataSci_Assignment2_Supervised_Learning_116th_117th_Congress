A BILL 
To facilitate screening and criminal history background 
checks for individuals seeking access to qualified chemical 
and refining infrastructure entities, and for other pur-
poses. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Expedient Workforce 
4
Screening Act of 2020’’.

SEC. 2. PURPOSE; FINDINGS. 
6
(a) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act is to facili-
7
tate screening for individuals seeking access to qualified

chemical and refining infrastructure entities in a manner 
1
that promotes public safety while protecting the interests 
2
of both individuals and qualified entities. 
3
(b) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
4
(1) Federal Criminal History Record Informa-
5
tion (CHRI) is an essential and widely accepted re-
6
source for background screening. 
7
(2) The Federal Bureau of Investigation’s 
8
(FBI) existing CHRI system, the Interstate Identi-
9
fication Index (III), including the National Finger-
10
print File (NFF), is a partnership between the 
11
States and the FBI. It is the primary means for ac-
12
cessing and communicating CHRI for criminal jus-
13
tice and certain critical noncriminal justice purposes. 
14
(3) The existing CHRI system is built on infor-
15
mation maintained by the States. CHRI available 
16
from the States represents 95 percent of the CHRI 
17
available for background check decisions. 
18
(4) Today, access to a national criminal history 
19
background check through the FBI is dependent on 
20
a patchwork of legal authorizations, resulting in on-
21
going requests for new Federal or State authorizing 
22
legislation by private sector entities that do not cur-
23
rently have a means of access.

•HR 6186 IH
(5) An enhanced system for facilitating chem-
1
ical and refining infrastructure access to CHRI for 
2
venue access should rely upon a user-fee-funded 
3
mechanism through which qualified chemical and re-
4
fining infrastructure entities nationwide can obtain 
5
fingerprint-based positive identification and national 
6
criminal history background checks from the FBI. 
7
(6) Qualified chemical and refining infrastruc-
8
ture entities should be free to use either a national 
9
criminal history background check through the FBI 
10
or a court-sourced history record information 
11
through a check using name and other identifiers, 
12
fingerprints, or a combination of both. 
13
(7) Any national system for qualified chemical 
14
and refining infrastructure noncriminal justice back-
15
ground checks must adhere to high standards for 
16
privacy and security, including mechanisms for those 
17
seeking access to challenge accuracy and complete-
18
ness of the information reported about them. 
19
(8) The national criminal history background 
20
check system should leverage the most recent tech-
21
nological advances to obtain high speed responses, as 
22
well as enhance accuracy and completeness. 
23
(9) The national criminal history background 
24
check system does not alter the Department of 
25

SEC. 3. NATIONAL CRIMINAL HISTORY BACKGROUND 
4
CHECK PROGRAM. 
5
(a) ESTABLISHMENT OF THE PROGRAM.—The Attor-
6
ney General, acting through the Director of the FBI, shall 
7
establish and implement a program to be known as the 
8
‘‘National Criminal History Chemical and Refining Back-
9
ground Check Program’’ (referred to in this Act as the 
10
‘‘Program’’) to permit qualified entities to request na-
11
tional criminal history background checks for the purpose 
12
of obtaining identification authentication and criminal his-
13
tory background check information of individuals seeking 
14
access to a qualified entity. 
15
(b) REQUEST SYSTEM.—The Program shall include 
16
a system through which a qualified entity may request a 
17
national criminal history background check directly 
18
through the FBI, which system shall be fingerprint-sup-
19
ported and maintain appropriate privacy protections. 
20
(c) ROLE OF QUALIFIED EDUCATIONAL ENTITIES.— 
21
The Program shall include a process through which a 
22
qualified educational entity may assist in— 
23
(1) identification authentication of individuals 
24
seeking access to a qualified entity and may obtain 
25
04:16 Mar 17, 2020

•HR 6186 IH
access to the personally identifiable information of 
1
such individuals; and 
2
(2) setting criminal history record information 
3
standards for access to qualified entities. 
4
(d) RESPONSE TIME.—To the extent practicable, the 
5
FBI shall respond to a request received under the national 
6
criminal history background check program under this 
7
section not later than two business days after receipt of 
8
such request. 
9
(e) FEES.—The Attorney General may charge a fee 
10
for conducting a national criminal history background 
11
check under this section, except that the amount of such 
12
fee may not exceed the actual cost of the background 
13
check. For purposes of calculating the actual cost of the 
14
background check, the Attorney General shall include the 
15
cost of building, maintaining, and enhancing an appro-
16
priate Federal and State infrastructure for the national 
17
criminal history background check system, technology 
18
costs, staffing costs, and administrative costs based on the 
19
sum of both State-by-State and Federal costs, and shall 
20
review the amount of the fee no less frequently than every 
21
two years.
