vakia to study under Rabbi Shumel Dvoid Ungar in 
1
Nitra. 
2
(2) During his time in Nitra, he quickly became 
3
a senior figure within the local Jewish community 
4
and Yeshiva. 
5
(3) Weissmandl was responsible for some of the 
6
daring efforts to save the Jewish people of Slovakia 
7
from the Holocaust, which include the establishment 
8
of a ‘‘Working Group’’, an underground organization 
9
that raised funds to negotiate ransom with German 
10
and Slovakian officials in order to delay mass depor-
11
tations. 
12
(4) During the Nazi regime, Weissmandl used 
13
his contacts from England to obtain visas, becoming 
14
one of the first to actively protect people of Jewish 
15
ancestry in Europe. 
16
(5) Weissmandl also wrote telegrams to gen-
17
erate awareness of the Jewish people’s plight and 
18
encouraged other strategic approaches to stop the 
19
Holocaust, including the bombing of railroad tunnels 
20
to prevent the transportation of persons to con-
21
centration camps. 
22
(6) Weissmandl established a Working Group— 
23
a wide variety of people from different political and 
24

ideological spectrums—whose common goal was to 
1
save people from the ‘‘Final Solution’’. 
2
(7) The Working Group was one of the first to 
3
document in writing the accounts of Auschwitz 
4
Escapees in a document widely referred to as the 
5
‘‘Auschwitz Protocols’’. 
6
(8) Weissmandl himself later translated the ini-
7
tial documentation from German to Hebrew and in-
8
cluded a widely known addendum that pleaded for 
9
action. 
10
(9) Weissmandl wrote the first known appeal 
11
for the use of Allied air resources to disrupt the Hol-
12
ocaust. 
13
(10) In 1942 when Slovakia started deportation 
14
for ‘‘resettlement’’, Rabbi Weissmandl was the first 
15
to inform the Working Group that people were being 
16
murdered and not sent to work as originally claimed. 
17
(11) Rabbi Weissmandl also played an instru-
18
mental role in Solomon Schoenfeld Kindertransport 
19
rescue, helping save hundreds of lives. 
20
(12) Rabbi Weissmandl came to America and in 
21
1945 immediately got to work to establish a home 
22
and Yeshiva for Holocaust survivors. The Yeshiva of 
23
Nitra he established in Mount Kisco, New York, was 
24

the first Yeshiva campus in America and became an 
1
example that other institutions followed. 
2
(13) Rabbi Weissmandl has significantly influ-
3
enced the flourishing communities of Talmudic 
4
scholars in Brooklyn, New York, and generally
