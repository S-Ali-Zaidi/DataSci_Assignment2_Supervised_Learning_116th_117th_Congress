•HR 8731 IH
(1) Between 2015 and 2019, on average, 88 
1
percent of wildfires in the United States have been 
2
human-caused. 
3
(2) Human-caused fires tend to occur in or 
4
near the wildland-urban interface (as defined in sec-
5
tion 101 of the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 
6
2003 (16 U.S.C. 6511)), where there is a greater 
7
risk to people and communities and a higher cost to 
8
suppress fires. 
9
(3) The wildland-urban interface is the fastest- 
10
growing land use type in the United States, posing 
11
challenges for fire management and suppression. 
12
(4) Over the last 10 years, an average of 
13
64,100 wildfires and an average of 6.8 million acres 
14
burned annually. In 2019, 50,477 wildfires burned 
15
and 4,700,000 acres burned nationwide. Approxi-
16
mately 65 percent of these acres burned on Federal 
17
land, of which close to 20 percent or 600,000 acres 
18
were National Forest System lands. 
19
(5) The Forest Service suffers from chronic 
20
staffing shortages, with several National Forests 
21
struggling to maintain their acreage with insufficient 
22
recreation management and planning staff.
