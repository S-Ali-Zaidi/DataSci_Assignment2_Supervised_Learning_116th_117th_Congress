SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
1
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following find-
2
ings: 
3
(1) On July 16, 1969, the Apollo 11 spacecraft 
4
launched from the John F. Kennedy Space Center 
5
carrying Neil A. Armstrong, Edwin E. ‘‘Buzz’’ 
6
Aldrin, Jr., and Michael Collins. 
7
(2) July 20, 2019, will mark the 50th anniver-
8
sary of the date on which the Apollo 11 spacecraft 
9
landed on the Moon and Neil Armstrong and Buzz 
10
Aldrin became the first humans to set foot on a ce-
11
lestial body off the Earth. 
12
(3) The landing of the Apollo 11 spacecraft and 
13
humanity’s first off-world footprints are achieve-
14
ments unparalleled in history, a direct product of the 
15
work and perseverance of the more than 400,000 in-
16
dividuals who contributed to the development of the 
17
Apollo missions on the shoulders of centuries of 
18
science and engineering pioneers from all corners of 
19
the world. 
20
(4) Among the thousands of individuals who 
21
have contributed to the achievements of the National 
22
Aeronautics and Space Administration (in this sec-
23
tion referred to as ‘‘NASA’’) are African-American 
24
women 
such 
as 
Katherine 
Johnson, 
Dorothy 
25
Vaughn, Mary Jackson, and Dr. Christine Darden,

who made critical contributions to NASA space pro-
1
grams. Katherine Johnson worked at NASA for 35 
2
years and calculated the trajectory of the Apollo 11 
3
landing and the trajectories for the spaceflights of 
4
astronauts Alan Shepard and John Glenn. Katherine 
5
Johnson, together with many other individuals the 
6
work of whom often went unacknowledged, helped 
7
broaden the scope of space travel and charted new 
8
frontiers for humanity’s exploration of space. 
9
(5) The landing of the Apollo 11 spacecraft was 
10
made on behalf of all humankind, and Neil Arm-
11
strong and Buzz Aldrin were accompanied by mes-
12
sages of peace from the leaders of more than 70 
13
countries. 
14
(6) The lunar landing sites of the Apollo 11 
15
spacecraft, the robotic spacecraft that preceded the 
16
Apollo 11 mission, and the crewed and robotic 
17
spacecraft that followed, are of outstanding uni-
18
versal value to humanity. 
19
(7) Such landing sites— 
20
(A) are the first archaeological sites with 
21
human activity that are not on Earth; 
22
(B) provide evidence of the first achieve-
23
ments of humankind in the realm of space trav-
24
el and exploration; and 
25

(C) contain artifacts and other evidence of 
1
human exploration activities that remain a po-
2
tential source of cultural, historical, archae-
3
ological, anthropological, scientific, and engi-
4
neering knowledge. 
5
(8) As commercial enterprises and more coun-
6
tries acquire the ability to land on the Moon, it is 
7
necessary to ensure the recognition and protection of 
8
the Apollo 11 landing site and other historic landing 
9
sites together with all the human effort and innova-
10
tion the sites represent. 
11
(9) On July 20, 2011, NASA published the vol-
12
untary guidance entitled ‘‘NASA’s Recommendations 
13
to Space-Faring Entities: How to Protect and Pre-
14
serve the Historic and Scientific Value of U.S. Gov-
15
ernment Lunar Artifacts’’. 
16
(10) In March 2018, the Office of Science and 
17
Technology Policy published a report entitled ‘‘Pro-
18
tecting & Preserving Apollo Program Lunar Landing 
19
Sites & Artifacts’’. 
20
(11) The Apollo 11 landing site and other simi-
21
lar historic landing sites in outer space merit legal 
22
protection from inadvertent or intentional inter-
23
ference with such sites or the environment sur-
24
rounding such sites in order to prevent irremediable

•HR 3766 IH
loss of archaeological, anthropological, historical, sci-
1
entific, and engineering significance and value. 
2
(12) Space-faring entities based outside the 
3
United States have the capacity to land on the 
4
Moon. 
5
(13) The licensing requirements under this Act 
6
are applicable only to United States-based activities 
7
in outer space and therefore have limited efficacy for 
8
protecting against intentional or inadvertent disturb-
9
ances of the Apollo 11 landing site and other similar 
10
historic sites from space-faring entities based outside 
11
the United States. 
12
(14) A binding international agreement to pro-
13
tect the Apollo 11 landing site and other similar his-
14
toric sites by requiring adherence to the rec-
15
ommendations described in section 3(b) would be 
16
sufficient to protect against intentional or inad-
17
vertent disturbances of the Apollo 11 landing site 
18
and other similar historic sites. 
19
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
20
gress that the President should initiate a diplomatic initia-
21
tive to negotiate an international agreement described in 
22
subsection (a)(14).
