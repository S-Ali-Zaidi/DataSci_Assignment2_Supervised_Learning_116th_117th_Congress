RESOLUTION 
To state the need for action on statehood for Puerto Rico 
if the status wins a majority of the vote on the question 
in the territory’s plebiscite on November 3. 
Whereas the United States acquired Puerto Rico through the 
Spanish-American War intending to keep the islands, but 
the Supreme Court divined that the territory had become 
a possession of the United States, meaning that it can 
become either a State or a sovereign nation and it can 
be treated differently than parts of the United States;

Whereas, in 1917, United States citizenship was granted to 
individuals born in Puerto Rico to permanently bind the 
territory to the Nation; 
Whereas territory status prevents the 3.1 million Americans 
of the islands from having votes in the Government that 
makes their laws (other than the vote in committee of a 
resident commissioner), a democratic deficit, which all of 
the territory’s leaders reject; 
Whereas Puerto Rico is a State for the purposes of most— 
but not all—Federal laws, but the territory and our fel-
low Americans there are, overall, treated worse than the 
States and their residents; 
Whereas it has been the longstanding policy of the United 
States that a vote among our citizens in the territory will 
determine whether it will ultimately become a State or a 
nation; 
Whereas Puerto Rico’s last two status plebiscites, which were 
limited to but included all of the territory’s possible fu-
ture statuses, rejected the current status and chose state-
hood but the number of votes caused some people to 
question whether they accurately reflected the electorate; 
Whereas the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Eco-
nomic Stability Act (Public Law 114–187) recognizes the 
territory’s ‘‘right to determine its future political status’’ 
through the plebiscite provided for by Public Law 113– 
76 or otherwise; 
Whereas the elected government of Puerto Rico has enacted 
a law to have a plebiscite on statehood on November 3, 
2020; 
Whereas the vote would resolve any question as to the will 
of the territory because opponents of equality within the

Nation for any reason—including, but not limited to, 
support of the current status or a desire for nation-
hood—could vote ‘‘No’’; 
Whereas we recognize the Department of Justice has issued 
an opinion and express our opposition to it on grounds 
that the plebiscite language is a simple, clear question 
and allows voters to vote for the status of their choice 
through the yes-or-no framework; 
Whereas those who favor Puerto Rico’s status as a territory 
or sovereign nation can vote ‘‘No’’ on the ballot in No-
vember; and 
Whereas Congress has the ultimate authority to admit new 
States regardless of any Department of Justice opinion 
in accordance with article IV, section 3, clause 1 of the 
Constitution: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) declares that the Congress and the Presi-
2
dent will have a duty to act in 2021 on the self-de-
3
termination choice of the people of Puerto Rico if 
4
the plebiscite chooses statehood; 
5
(2) recognizes that implementation legislation 
6
will need to include measures to phase-in the equal 
7
treatment of the territory and its residents in Fed-
8
eral laws; and 
9
(3) states that such measures should implement 
10
equality for Puerto Rico and Puerto Ricans as expe-
11
ditiously as reasonably possible.
