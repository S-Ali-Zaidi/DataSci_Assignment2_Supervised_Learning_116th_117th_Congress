Congress makes the following findings:

(1) According to the report issued by the Na-
5
tional Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Med-
6
icine in 2018 entitled ‘‘Sexual Harassment of 
7
Women: Climate, Culture, and Consequences in Aca-
8
demic Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine’’— 
9
(A) sexual harassment is pervasive in insti-
10
tutions of higher education; 
11
(B) the most common type of sexual har-
12
assment is gender harassment, which includes 
13
verbal and nonverbal behaviors that convey in-
14
sulting, hostile, and degrading attitudes about 
15
members of one gender; 
16
(C) 58 percent of individuals in the aca-
17
demic workplace experience sexual harassment, 
18
the second highest rate when compared to the 
19
military, the private sector, and Federal, State, 
20
and local government;

•HR 36 IH
(D) women who are members of racial or 
1
ethnic minority groups are more likely to expe-
2
rience sexual harassment and to feel unsafe at 
3
work than White women, White men, or men 
4
who are members of such groups; 
5
(E) the training for each individual who 
6
has a doctor of philosophy in the science, tech-
7
nology, engineering, and mathematics fields is 
8
estimated to cost approximately $500,000; and 
9
(F) attrition of an individual so trained re-
10
sults in a loss of talent and money. 
11
(2) Sexual harassment undermines career ad-
12
vancement for women. 
13
(3) According to a 2017 study led by Dr. Kath-
14
ryn Clancy at the University of Illinois, among as-
15
tronomers and planetary scientists, 18 percent of 
16
women who are members of racial or ethnic minority 
17
groups and 12 percent of White women skipped pro-
18
fessional events because they did not feel safe at-
19
tending. 
20
(4) Many women report leaving employment at 
21
institutions of higher education due to sexual har-
22
assment. 
23
(5) Research shows the majority of individuals 
24
do not formally report experiences of sexual harass-
25
02:52 Jan 08, 2019

•HR 36 IH
ment due to a justified fear of retaliation or other 
1
negative professional or personal consequences. 
2
(6) Reporting procedures with respect to such 
3
harassment are inconsistent among Federal science 
4
agencies and have varying degrees of accessibility. 
5
(7) There is not adequate communication 
6
among Federal science agencies and between such 
7
agencies and grantees regarding reports of sexual 
8
harassment, which has resulted in harassers receiv-
9
ing Federal funding after moving to a different in-
10
stitution.
