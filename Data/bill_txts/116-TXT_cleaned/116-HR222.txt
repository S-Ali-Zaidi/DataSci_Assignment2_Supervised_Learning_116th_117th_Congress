RESOLUTION 
Emphasizing the importance of alliances and partnerships. 
Whereas from the American Revolution, through two World 
Wars, the Cold War, and the fight against international 
terrorist organizations, the United States has successfully 
relied on alliances and partnerships with like-minded 
countries to further its vital security, political, and eco-
nomic interests, starting with the Treaty of Alliance with 
France in 1778 and continuing to the present day; 
Whereas the United States alliances and partnerships are 
among America’s most precious geopolitical assets, 
strengthening 
the 
United 
States 
military 
power, 
geostrategic influence, global legitimacy, diplomatic lever-
age, and economic influence by establishing enduring co-
operation among like-minded countries and deterring po-
tential aggressors;

Whereas alliances and partnerships strengthen the ability of 
the United States to advance the universal values of de-
mocracy, human rights, and the rule of law; 
Whereas the United States has maintained alliances since 
1945 to protect its security and long-term interests and 
which often resulted in substantial diplomatic, political, 
and military support for bilateral or multilateral action 
that advanced United States interests, including major 
humanitarian missions and the use of military force; 
Whereas the United States has built a global network of mu-
tually beneficial alliances and partnerships with countries 
across Europe, Asia-Pacific, Africa, the Middle East, and 
the Western Hemisphere, which allows the United States 
to extend its influence, conduct military operations, and 
reduce the impact that adversary countries might have in 
these regions; 
Whereas, since 1945, successive generations of United States 
leaders have learned to successfully manage the chal-
lenges and constraints inherent in alliances, thus ensur-
ing that the benefits of alliances outweigh the costs; 
Whereas the United States was a founding member and lead-
er of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), a 
bastion of democratic allies, which continues to be the 
bedrock of transatlantic security and stability after nearly 
70 years; 
Whereas allies have greatly enhanced the United States mili-
tary power by contributing significant forces to many 
American military actions for more than 100 years, thus 
placing more combat power on the battlefield while reduc-
ing the burden borne by the United States;

Whereas the United States military alliances and partner-
ships allow the United States to leverage allies’ special-
ized 
capabilities, 
including 
unique 
technologies, 
warfighting skills, and specific intelligence assets; 
Whereas longstanding alliances have allowed the United 
States and its allies to implement the training, equip-
ment, and interoperability standards necessary to quickly 
mobilize and respond to any threat across the world; 
Whereas the United States alliances reduce weapons of mass 
destruction proliferation by enabling better global co-
operation against the spread of nuclear weapons and 
other threats; and 
Whereas alliances and partnerships support the United 
States diplomatic interests by providing the United 
States with the ability to leverage a multinational global 
response to issues through a variety of means and con-
tribute to a global rules-based order: Now, therefore, be 
it
