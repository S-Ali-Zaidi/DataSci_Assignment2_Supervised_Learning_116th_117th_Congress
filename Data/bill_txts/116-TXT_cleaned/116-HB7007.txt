SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) In the early weeks of the spread of the virus 
3
responsible for COVID–19, the Government of 
4
China systematically suppressed, misrepresented, 
5
and falsified information concerning such spread. 
6
(2) The first reported instance of such virus 
7
may have occurred on November 17, 2019, in 
8
Wuhan, China. The Government of China did not 
9
notify the WHO that it had detected an unknown 
10
respiratory illness until December 31, 2020. 
11
(3) The Government of China violated inter-
12
national law by covering up the origins and spread 
13
of such virus. 
14
(4) Articles 6 and 7 of the International Health 
15
Regulations of 2005 require notification to the 
16
WHO within 24 hours of an assessment of events 
17
that may constitute a public health emergency of 
18
international concern. 
19
(5) The International Health Regulations re-
20
quire the WHO to be notified of ‘‘all relevant public 
21
health information’’ regarding public health events 
22
of international concern, and for information to be 
23
shared in a ‘‘timely, accurate, and sufficiently de-
24
tailed manner’’. 
25
02:20 Jun 17, 2020
H7007

•HR 7007 IH
(6) The Government of China failed to share 
1
information with the WHO, and embarked on a 
2
campaign to silence doctors, scientists, and whistle-
3
blowers in an attempt to mislead the Chinese people 
4
and the international community concerning the 
5
spread of such virus. 
6
(7) On December 27, 2020, samples of the 
7
virus found in hospitals in Wuhan, China, were ana-
8
lyzed and determined to be a novel coronavirus. 
9
(8) The Government of China did not share 
10
with the WHO such determination concerning the 
11
novel coronavirus. 
12
(9) On January 3, 2020, the Government of 
13
China ordered Chinese scientists working to se-
14
quence the genome of such virus to surrender or de-
15
stroy their samples and the Government of China 
16
did not publicly share the genetic sequence until 
17
January 12, 2020. 
18
(10) In early January, the Government of 
19
China jailed eight medical professionals who sought 
20
to share information relating to such virus. 
21
(11) 
A 
Chinese 
ophthalmologist, 
Dr. 
Li 
22
Wenliang, tried to warn the medical community of 
23
such virus. The Government of China forced Dr. Li 
24
to sign a letter stating that he made ‘‘false state-
25
02:20 Jun 17, 2020
H7007
5 
•HR 7007 IH
ments’’ concerning such virus. Dr. Li later became 
1
infected with such virus and died on February 7, 
2
2020. 
3
(12) The Government of China insisted that no 
4
evidence existed concerning the spread of such virus 
5
through person-to-person transmission, and allowed 
6
Chinese citizens to travel unimpeded, including dur-
7
ing the Lunar New Year, when travelers numbered 
8
in the hundreds of millions. 
9
(13) On December 31, 2020, the Government 
10
of Taiwan noted the possibility that such virus could 
11
spread through person-to-person transmission. Offi-
12
cials of the WHO sent to China did not announce 
13
that such virus could spread through person-to-per-
14
son transmission until January 22, 2020. 
15
(14) The Government of China continues to 
16
neutralize or eliminate actors who threaten to expose 
17
the Government of China’s culpability in the spread 
18
of such virus. 
19
(15) Wuhan Central Hospital reprimanded Dr. 
20
Ai Fen for sharing a picture of a patient report la-
21
beled ‘‘SARS Coronavirus’’. In an interview pub-
22
lished in the Chinese magazine Ren Wu on March 
23
10, 2020, Doctor Ai said ‘‘This incident has shown 
24
that everyone needs to have their own thoughts be-
25

•HR 7007 IH
cause someone has to step up to speak the truth.’’. 
1
Dr. Ai has been missing since March 29, 2020, and 
2
it is believed the Government of China is involved in 
3
his disappearance. 
4
(16) The repeated violations of the Inter-
5
national Health Regulations by the Government of 
6
China caused the spread of such virus first in 
7
Wuhan, China, and then worldwide. 
8
(17) As of May 18, 2020, such spread affected 
9
188 countries worldwide, resulting in millions of con-
10
firmed cases and more than 317,000 deaths. 
11
(18) As of May 18, 2020, 496,509 Americans 
12
were infected by such virus and 89,874 of those peo-
13
ple died. 
14
(19) On May 15, 2020, the Asia Development 
15
bank estimated that such spread will cost the global 
16
economy between $5.8 trillion and $8.8 trillion in 
17
2020. 
18
(20) The International Labor Organization esti-
19
mated that the spread of such virus caused a 10.5 
20
percent drop in working hours globally, which is 
21
equivalent to 305 million full-time jobs. 
22
(21) As of April 2020, the Bureau of Labor 
23
Statistics reported 26.5 million Americans lost their 
24
jobs. 
25
02:20 Jun 17, 2020

•HR 7007 IH
(22) More than 38.6 million Americans filed 
1
unemployment claims over an eight-week period end-
2
ing on May 16, 2020, bringing the total of unem-
3
ployed Americans to more than 40 million. 
4
(23) The real unemployment rate is estimated 
5
to be between 22.8 percent and 25 percent. 
6
(24) On April 24, 2020, the Congressional 
7
Budget Office predicted that the United States 
8
Gross Domestic Product would fall 12 percent in the 
9
second quarter of 2020, equivalent to a decline at 
10
annual rate of 40 percent. 
11
(25) To mitigate the economic impact of such 
12
spread and bolster response efforts, Congress appro-
13
priated nearly $3 trillion in emergency spending. 
14
(26) In April 2020, the Congressional Budget 
15
Office nearly quadrupled its Fiscal Year 2020 Fed-
16
eral budget deficit projection from $1 trillion in Jan-
17
uary 2020 to $3.7 trillion. 
18
(27) If China had acted in accordance with its 
19
international obligations just three weeks earlier, the 
20
number of early coronavirus cases may have been 95 
21
percent lower.

(1) in February 2020, the United States cor-
1
rectly designated Chinese state-owned media outlets

SEC. 5. STATEMENT OF POLICY.
