1
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that— 
2
(1) the native fish, wildlife, and plant species in 
3
the United States are part of a rich natural heritage 
4
and an important legacy to pass on to future genera-
5
tions; 
6
(2) the populations of many native fish, wildlife, 
7
and plant species in the United States are in decline; 
8
(3) scientists estimate that 1 in 5 animal and 
9
plant species in the United States is at risk of ex-
10
tinction, and many species are declining in numbers; 
11

(4) threats to the survival and diversity of 
1
many native fish, wildlife, and plant species in the 
2
United States include the loss, degradation, frag-
3
mentation, and obstruction of natural habitats; 
4
(5) climate change threatens native fish, wild-
5
life, and plant species; 
6
(6) the 2019 global assessment report from the 
7
Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Bio-
8
diversity and Ecosystem Services found that— 
9
(A) 1,000,000 wildlife and plant species 
10
worldwide are now threatened with extinction; 
11
and 
12
(B) 75 percent of the land-based environ-
13
ment, and approximately 66 percent of the ma-
14
rine environment, have been significantly al-
15
tered by human actions; 
16
(7) the conservation of new and existing land-
17
scape and seascape corridors, through which native 
18
species can transition from 1 habitat to another, 
19
plays an important role in helping— 
20
(A) to conserve native biodiversity; and 
21
(B) to ensure resiliency against impacts 
22
from a range of biotic and abiotic stressors; 
23
(8) the conservation, restoration, and establish-
24
ment of new ecological connections to facilitate the 
25
16:47 May 25, 2019
H2795

•HR 2795 IH
movement of species into more suitable habitats is a 
1
key climate change adaptation strategy; 
2
(9) the protection of new and existing corridors 
3
is often one of the first steps in restoration and re-
4
covery planning; 
5
(10) States have recognized the importance of 
6
habitat connectivity, including— 
7
(A) a New England Governors and East-
8
ern Canadian Premiers’ Conference on the im-
9
portance of connectivity for ecosystem adapt-
10
ability and resilience, biodiversity, and human 
11
communities; and 
12
(B) an expired 2007 policy resolution of 
13
the Western Governors’ Association; 
14
(11) the strategic plan of the United States 
15
Fish and Wildlife Service to respond to accelerating 
16
climate change entitled ‘‘Rising to the Urgent Chal-
17
lenge’’ acknowledges that ‘‘processes such as polli-
18
nation, seed dispersal, nutrient cycling, natural dis-
19
turbance cycles, predator-prey relations, and others 
20
must be part of the natural landscapes we seek to 
21
maintain or restore . . . and are likely to function 
22
more optimally in landscapes composed of large 
23
habitat blocks connected by well-placed corridors’’;

•HR 2795 IH
(12) Federal and State agencies continue to de-
1
velop policies to address— 
2
(A) the importance of conserving fish, 
3
wildlife, and plant corridors; 
4
(B) the gap between science and manage-
5
ment for at-risk species; and 
6
(C) ecological connectivity; and 
7
(13) Federal policies consistently recognize the 
8
importance of voluntary improvement projects by 
9
private landowners to habitat conservation and res-
10
toration for native species. 
11
(b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this Act are— 
12
(1) to support a diverse array of native species, 
13
including species protected under Federal, State, 
14
and Tribal law, that have experienced or may experi-
15
ence habitat loss, degradation, fragmentation, or ob-
16
struction to connectivity; 
17
(2) to provide long-term habitat connectivity for 
18
native species migration, dispersal, adaptation to cli-
19
mate and other environmental change, and genetic 
20
exchange; 
21
(3) to help restore wildlife movements that have 
22
been disrupted by habitat loss, degradation, frag-
23
mentation, or obstruction;
