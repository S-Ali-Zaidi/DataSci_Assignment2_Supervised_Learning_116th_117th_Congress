Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

4
of 2019’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
The Congress finds the following:

•HR 2787 IH
(1) Each year the Bureau of Labor Statistics of 
1
the Department of Labor prepares and publishes 
2
consumer price indices (the most notable being the 
3
Consumer Price Index or ‘‘CPI’’) that measure the 
4
rate of inflation in the economy of the United 
5
States. 
6
(2) A derivative of the CPI is used to determine 
7
an annual cost-of-living adjustment (hereinafter re-
8
ferred to as ‘‘COLA’’) for millions of senior citizens 
9
(individuals aged 62 and over) who depend on their 
10
respective Social Security benefits. 
11
(3) The Social Security COLA is calculated 
12
using the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage 
13
Earners and Clerical Workers (hereinafter referred 
14
to as ‘‘CPI–W’’), a subset of the population covered 
15
by the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Con-
16
sumers (hereinafter referred to as ‘‘CPI–U’’). 
17
(4) While the experimental Consumer Price 
18
Index for Americans 62 Years of Age and Older 
19
(hereinafter referred to as ‘‘CPI–E’’) is a more ac-
20
curate measure of the average price of consumer 
21
goods and services purchased by senior citizens than 
22
the CPI–W, it too is derived from the CPI–U. 
23
(5) According to numerous credible authorities, 
24
the present methods (CPI–U, CPI–W, and CPI–E

to a lesser extent) used to measure inflation are 
1
flawed and deficient in measuring the average price 
2
of consumer goods and services purchased by senior 
3
citizens, and the overall impact of inflation on such 
4
citizens. 
5
(6) The present sampling regarding senior citi-
6
zens is too small under the methods referred to in 
7
paragraph (5), creating an opportunity for sampling 
8
error. 
9
(7) Prices used under the methods referred to 
10
in paragraph (5) are based on geographic areas, re-
11
tail outlets, and sample items used and purchased by 
12
younger consumers and are not necessarily rep-
13
resentative of the geographic areas, retail outlets, 
14
and sample items used and purchased by senior citi-
15
zens. 
16
(8) The locations used under the methods re-
17
ferred to in paragraph (5) are urban locations that 
18
do not reflect the economic challenges faced in rural 
19
communities, which often have a far larger demo-
20
graphic segment of senior citizens. 
21
(9) Senior citizens neither have the flexibility or 
22
the ability that younger consumers have to sub-
23
stitute necessary purchases in response to changes 
24

in prices, nor the same options as younger con-
1
sumers have to supplement their income. 
2
(10) Premium increases for part B of Medicare, 
3
part D of Medicare, and other health care costs af-
4
fecting senior citizens are not adequately considered 
5
under the methods referred to in paragraph (5). 
6
(11) The cost of taxes on Social Security in-
7
come is not considered under the methods referred 
8
to in paragraph (5), thus putting senior citizens at 
9
a greater economic disadvantage each year.
