RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the Congress should enact the Older Americans Bill of 
Rights to establish that older Americans should have 
the right to live with dignity and with independence. 
Whereas the percentage of the United States population that 
is 65 years of age and older, including the percentage of 
aging veterans, is rapidly expanding, with 10,000 Ameri-
cans turning age 65 every day; 
Whereas Federal policies are needed that promote economic 
well-being and quality of life for older Americans across 
many different communities, recognizing race and eth-
nicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, cultural diver-
sity, and the growing inequality between poor and 
wealthy families; 
Whereas Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and the Older 
Americans Act of 1965 provide critical resources to aging 
Americans and their families but should be expanded and 
improved to meet growing needs; 
Whereas prescription drug prices in the United States are 
nearly 4 times higher on average than in other peer na-
tions, a burden that disproportionately falls on older

Americans, as almost 90 percent of adults 65 or older 
take a prescription drug; 
Whereas aging Americans deserve a dignified, secure, and 
independent retirement, but nearly half of all Americans 
55 and older have no retirement benefits or savings; 
Whereas aging women (the majority of those over 65) live 
longer on average, are more likely to live in poverty, earn 
lower Social Security benefits, and are less likely to have 
pensions because of paycheck disparities, time spent out 
of the workforce for family caregiving responsibilities, 
and a greater chance of having worked low-wage jobs; 
Whereas older Americans in rural, low-income, minority, In-
dian country, and other underserved communities may be 
especially vulnerable because of a lack of access to needed 
and affordable services that allow them to remain in their 
communities, including adequate transportation, func-
tioning technology, and protected voting rights; 
Whereas 5,140,000 older Americans lived in poverty in 2018; 
5,500,000 older Americans were food insecure in 2017; 
40,000 older Americans experienced homelessness in 
2017 (a number projected to nearly triple to 106,000 by 
2030), and 1 in 5 Americans age 65 and older are so-
cially isolated; 
Whereas many older Americans are living longer, working 
longer, and enjoying healthier, more active lifestyles than 
past generations, while others are facing shorter lifespans 
and increased physical, mental, and psychological chal-
lenges; 
Whereas age-friendly movements are gaining momentum 
across the country in communities, health systems, and

public health initiatives but are not yet fully aligned and 
coordinated to ensure maximum results; 
Whereas 70 percent of those reaching age 65 will require 
long-term services and supports and will need to rely on 
family, friends, or paid caregivers; 
Whereas by 2035 it is estimated that 1 in 3 households will 
be headed by someone aged 65 or older, but many older 
Americans face challenges in obtaining or keeping afford-
able, safe, and accessible housing; 
Whereas 6,000,000 children are being raised by their grand-
parents who require the same rights and supports as par-
ents; 
Whereas approximately 75 percent of Medicare beneficiaries 
who need a hearing aid do not have one; 70 percent of 
beneficiaries who have trouble eating because of their 
teeth did not go to the dentist in the past year; and 43 
percent of beneficiaries who have trouble seeing did not 
have an eye exam in the past year; and 
Whereas older Americans are increasingly the victims of 
fraud, scams, exploitation, identity theft, and even phys-
ical and financial abuse, that threaten their dignity, secu-
rity, and health: Now, therefore, be it
