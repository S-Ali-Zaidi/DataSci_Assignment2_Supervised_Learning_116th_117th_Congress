A BILL 
To authorize the Secretary of Defense, upon request of the 
Ministry of Defense of Israel and with the concurrence 
of the Secretary of State, to carry out research, develop-
ment, test, and evaluation activities, on a joint basis 
with Israel, to establish directed energy capabilities that 
address threats to the United States, deployed forces 
of the United States, or Israel, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘United States-Israel 
2
Directed Energy Cooperation Act’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) Directed energy platforms are electro-
6
magnetic systems capable of converting chemical or 
7
electrical energy to radiated energy and focusing it 
8
on a target, resulting in physical damage that de-
9
grades or neutralizes an adversarial capability. 
10
These systems include high-energy lasers that emit 
11
photons and high-power microwaves that release ra-
12
diofrequency waves. 
13
(2) Directed energy platforms hold enormous 
14
potential for non-lethal, defensive capabilities, in-
15
cluding protection against advanced missiles and 
16
swarms of unmanned aerial systems. 
17
(3) At a fraction of the per-use cost of kinetic 
18
defense platforms, directed energy capabilities could 
19
greatly enhance the deterrence posture of the United 
20
States and protect against emerging threats such as 
21
hypersonic and maneuverable missiles. 
22
(4) The United States and Israel successfully 
23
partnered on directed energy capabilities during the 
24
1990s and early 2000s based on earlier-generation 
25

•HR 1795 IH
chemical laser technology, including the Tactical 
1
High Energy Laser (THEL). 
2
(5) In response to technological advances and 
3
emerging threats, the United States has increased 
4
investments in next-generation directed energy capa-
5
bilities and is exploring the potential for boost-phase 
6
ballistic missile defense with the Low-Power Laser 
7
Demonstrator program. Existing programs within 
8
each service branch are developing technologies to 
9
protect members of the Armed Forces from rocket, 
10
artillery, mortar, and unmanned aerial systems. 
11
(6) Since 2014, Israel has been developing Iron 
12
Beam, a laser platform to intercept mortars. In re-
13
sponse to a growing missile threat, Israel’s Ministry 
14
of Defense has increased investments in directed en-
15
ergy capabilities in recent years. 
16
(7) In 2017, the Department of Defense issued 
17
a report to Congress on the merits of renewed 
18
United States-Israel cooperation on directed energy, 
19
concluding that, ‘‘The United States should pursue 
20
joint collaboration with Israel on directed energy ca-
21
pabilities.’’. 
22
(8) In 2018, while offering remarks at the Di-
23
rected Energy Summit, Undersecretary of Defense 
24
for Research and Engineering Michael Griffin ex-
25

•HR 1795 IH
pressed support for the United States partnering 
1
with allies to develop directed energy technologies. 
2
(9) In 2019, the U.S. Missile Defense Review 
3
highlighted the promise that high-powered laser 
4
technology holds for boost-phase ballistic missile de-
5
fense.

(1) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary of Defense, 
10
upon request of the Ministry of Defense of Israel 
11
and with the concurrence of the Secretary of State,

test, and evaluation activities, on a joint basis with 
14
Israel, to establish directed energy capabilities that 
15
address threats to the United States, deployed forces 
16
of the United States, or Israel. Any activities carried 
17
out pursuant to such authority shall be conducted in 
18
a manner that appropriately protects sensitive infor-
19
mation and the national security interests of the
