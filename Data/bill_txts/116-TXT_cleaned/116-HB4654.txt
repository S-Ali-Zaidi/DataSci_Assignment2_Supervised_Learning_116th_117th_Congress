•HR 4654 IH
(1) The Department of Veterans Affairs pro-
1
vided $10,800,000,000 in educational assistance 
2
under the Post-9/11 Educational Assistance Pro-
3
gram benefits to almost 800,000 veterans during fis-
4
cal year 2014. 
5
(2) According to the General Accountability Of-
6
fice’s October 2015 report, the Department of Vet-
7
erans Affairs identified $416,000,000 in overpay-
8
ments under such Program during fiscal year 2014, 
9
affecting approximately one-in-four veteran bene-
10
ficiaries and about 6,000 schools. 
11
(3) According to such report, ‘‘while veterans 
12
using other VA education programs have to verify 
13
their enrollment each month, VA generally does not 
14
require those using the Post-9/11 GI Bill to do so. 
15
By not requiring veterans to verify their enrollment 
16
every month, which can cause significant time to 
17
lapse between when veterans drop courses and when 
18
this is reported, VA’s process allows veterans to 
19
incur thousands of dollars in overpayments and also 
20
increases the program’s costs associated with col-
21
lecting these debts.’’.
