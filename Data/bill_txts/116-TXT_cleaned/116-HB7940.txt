the harmful effects of pesticide products, as envi-
5
sioned by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and 
6
Rodenticide Act (7 U.S.C. 136 et seq.), resulting in 
7
the use of billions of pounds of pesticides every year 
8
that were approved based on outdated science;

(2) the United States lags behind the European 
10
Union and other developed nations in protecting its 
11
people and its environment from toxic chemicals, al-
12
lowing the use of 72 pesticides that have been 
13
banned or are being phased out in the European 
14
Union alone; 
15
(3) the EPA registers nearly 65 percent of pes-

19

that the most up-to-date, rigorous scientific informa-
