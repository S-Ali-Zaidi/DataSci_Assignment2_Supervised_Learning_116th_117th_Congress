of the Revised Statutes of the United States (42 
3
U.S.C. 1983) against a government official for ac-
4
tions taken in their official capacity is to be treated 
5
as a lawsuit against the entity of which the officer 
6
is an agent.

12
ernment officials in personal capacity cases in any 
13
way, but helps to ensure equitable and monetary re-
14
lief for victims of civil rights violations.
