CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the International Day of Peace. 
Whereas, on November 30, 1981, during the 77th plenary 
meeting, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a 
resolution to declare the third Tuesday of September as 
the International Day of Peace; 
Whereas, nearly 20 years later, the United Nations General 
Assembly adopted A/RES/55/282, which officially des-
ignated September 21 as a global day to recognize and 
celebrate international cease-fire and nonviolence; 
Whereas, on September 21, all United Nations Member 
States, organizations, regional and nongovernmental or-
ganizations, and individuals are encouraged to celebrate 
and recognize global peace efforts; 
Whereas the United States Institute of Peace coordinates an 
annual Peace Day Challenge, an international effort to

reaffirm peace as an authentic alternative to violence and 
war; 
Whereas according to the United States Institute of Peace, 
since 2015 the Peace Day Challenge has reached more 
than 104 million people in 148 countries; 
Whereas, in 2015, the USIP Global Peacebuilding Center de-
veloped an inaugural USIPEACE Teachers program 
which selected educators to incorporate peacebuilding into 
curricula and activities with students across the country; 
Whereas peace education programs help break the cycle of vi-
olence and conflict by developing active communities com-
mitted to peace scholarship and instruction; 
Whereas the 2019 Global Peace Index found that peaceful-
ness improved slightly for the first time in five years, but 
declined in 76 countries of those studied; 
Whereas the 2019 Global Peace Index also noted that for the 
past 10 years there has been a persistent decrease in the 
world’s peacefulness and that global violence cost $14.1 
trillion in 2018; 
Whereas these reports and actions underscore the importance 
of strengthening and supporting domestic and global ef-
forts to study, discuss, teach, and develop techniques and 
methods to encourage and augment global peace efforts; 
Whereas climate change threatens world economies, public 
health, and the environment, which affect the security 
and peaceful existence of global citizens and countries 
around the world; 
Whereas the Institute for Economics and Peace found that 
countries with lower levels of positive peace have a higher 
ratio of fatalities as a result of natural disasters;

tries around the world launched coordinated global pro-
tests demanding action on climate change in September
