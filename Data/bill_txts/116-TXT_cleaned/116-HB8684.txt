A BILL 
To provide for the establishment of the Alabama Underwater 
Forest National Marine Sanctuary, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Alabama Underwater 
4
Forest National Marine Sanctuary and Protection Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
The Congress finds and declares the following: 
7
(1) An ancient cypress forest dating back 
8
50,000 to 70,000 years B.C. has been exposed in the 
9
Gulf of Mexico off the Alabama coastline. The trees,

•HR 8684 IH
which were uncovered by massive waves associated 
1
with Hurricane Ivan, are still rooted in the mud they 
2
were growing in at least 50,000 years ago. 
3
(2) The Underwater Forest site is unique on a 
4
global scale, the only known site where trees between 
5
50,000 and 70,000 years old have been preserved in-
6
tact with the ecosystem they were growing in. 
7
(3) Exploration of the site continues to yield in-
8
valuable scientific insight in a variety of fields, 
9
though scientists have just begun to study the an-
10
cient forest. 
11
(4) Commercial interests are seeking to mine 
12
the ancient trees for the purpose of making con-
13
sumer goods, which would result in an irreplaceable 
14
loss to the scientific community. 
15
(5) Protection of the forest from commercial 
16
harvest also protects the site as a globally significant 
17
destination for scuba diving and associated tourism. 
18
Millions of people from around the world have seen 
19
news stories and documentaries about the forest, in-
20
undating dive tourism operators with requests to 
21
visit the site. 
22
