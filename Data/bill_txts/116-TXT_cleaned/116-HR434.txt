RESOLUTION 
Expressing the appreciation of the House of Representatives 
for Robert E. Wallace, retiring Executive Director of 
the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States, 
Washington Office. 
Whereas the congressionally-chartered Veterans of Foreign 
Wars of the United States (hereinafter, ‘‘VFW’’) has, 
since its founding in 1899, existed to serve United States 
veterans, members of the Armed Forces, and their fami-
lies, wherever they reside or are assigned; 
Whereas since 1996, Robert E. ‘‘Bob’’ Wallace, has helped 
lead the VFW Washington Office, which this year marks 
a centennial of service and advocacy in our Nation’s Cap-
ital to ensure that veterans and military communities are 
properly cared for by the Government that creates them;

Whereas Bob received three Purple Hearts for injuries sus-
tained in Vietnam as a member of the Marine Corps, re-
turned home to pursue a career in banking after earning 
a bachelor of science degree from Rutgers University and 
a master’s degree in business administration from 
Fairleigh Dickinson University, as well as graduating 
from the School for Bank Administration at the Univer-
sity of Wisconsin; 
Whereas Bob joined the VFW while in Vietnam and would 
be the recipient of the national organization’s 1979 
Young Veteran of the Year award, as well as from his 
home State of New Jersey, and he would go on to ap-
pointed and to elected VFW positions, including being 
the first Vietnam veteran and the youngest veteran to 
command the VFW Department of New Jersey from 
1980 to 1981, and culminating in his being elected as the 
VFW National Commander from 1991 to 1992; 
Whereas Bob has worked with five United States Presidents 
and a countless number of members of Congress, their 
staffs and fellow veterans organizations’ leadership to im-
plement change for America’s veterans, members of the 
Armed Forces, and their families; his is a voice of reason 
and motivation, coupled with a can-do attitude to meet 
every challenge that improves the quality of life of the 
military and veterans communities he serves; 
Whereas the VFW’s service officer program impacts lives, 
and Bob’s direct oversight of VFW National Veterans 
Service has enabled a nationwide and international cadre 
of 2,100 accredited service officers to recoup $8.3 billion 
in earned disability benefits for more than 526,000 
wounded, ill, and injured veterans in 2018 alone;

Whereas the VFW’s advocacy on Capitol Hill creates change 
that affects lives, and Bob’s direct oversight of the VFW 
National Legislative Service ensured that the organiza-
tion continued to have its fingerprints on every piece of 
quality-of-life legislation signed into law at the end of the 
20th century and well into the 21st; 
Whereas Bob’s proudest legislative accomplishments are 
many, from Department of Veterans Affairs funding bat-
tles prior to the signing of advanced appropriations, to 
the Millennium Act, significant improvements to the 
Montgomery GI Bill, the GI Bill for the 21st Century, 
and the Forever GI Bill, as well the passage of the VOW 
to Hire Heroes Act, appeals reform, expansion of the 
Caregiver program, and the new VA/Department of De-
fense electronic medical record, among numerous others; 
and 
Whereas the VFW’s support of our Nation’s Full Accounting 
mission is without peer because of Bob Wallace’s hands- 
on approach to ensure the governments of former en-
emies know from a veteran’s perspective—and from a 
family perspective—that the return of fallen members of 
the Armed Forces is a humanitarian mission that tran-
scends politics: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, that the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) salutes the leadership, guidance, and friend-
2
ship of Robert E. Wallace at the helm of the VFW 
3
Washington Office for the past 23 years; he met 
4
every challenge and the VFW, veterans, members of 
5
the Armed Forces, and their families everywhere are 
6
better off for his faithful service and advocacy; and
