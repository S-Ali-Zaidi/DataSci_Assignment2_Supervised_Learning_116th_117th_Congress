RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the President and the Secretary of State should ensure 
that the Government of Canada does not permanently 
store nuclear waste in the Great Lakes Basin. 
Whereas the water resources of the Great Lakes Basin are 
precious public natural resources shared by the Great 
Lakes States and the Provinces of Canada; 
Whereas, since 1909, the United States and Canada have 
worked to maintain and improve the water quality of the 
Great Lakes through water quality agreements;

Whereas more than 40,000,000 individuals in both Canada 
and the United States depend on the fresh water from 
the Great Lakes for drinking water; 
Whereas Ontario Power Generation is proposing to build a 
permanent deep geological repository for nuclear waste 
less than 1 mile from Lake Huron in Kincardine, On-
tario, Canada; 
Whereas the Government of Canada is proposing to build a 
permanent deep geological repository for high-level nu-
clear waste in the Great Lakes Basin; 
Whereas nuclear waste is highly toxic and can take tens of 
thousands of years to decompose to safe levels; 
Whereas a spill of nuclear waste into the Great Lakes, in-
cluding during transit to a permanent deep geological re-
pository for nuclear waste, could have lasting and se-
verely adverse environmental, health, and economic im-
pacts on the Great Lakes and the individuals who depend 
on the Great Lakes for their livelihoods; 
Whereas more than 187 local, county, State, and Tribal gov-
ernments have passed resolutions in opposition to the 
proposed nuclear waste repository of Ontario Power Gen-
eration; 
Whereas Tribes and First Nations’ citizens have a strong 
spiritual and cultural connection to the Great Lakes; 
Whereas the protection of the Great Lakes is fundamental to 
treaty rights; and 
Whereas, during the 1980s, when the Department of Energy 
was studying potential sites for a permanent nuclear 
waste repository in the United States in accordance with 
the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (42 U.S.C. 10101 
et seq.), the Government of Canada expressed concern

Lakes Basin; and 
10
(3) the President and the Secretary of State

should work together with their counterparts in the 
12
