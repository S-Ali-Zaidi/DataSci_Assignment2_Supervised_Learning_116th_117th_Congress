1
constituting diverse and dynamic cultures and 
2
people; and 
3
(C) face shared challenges and opportuni-
4
ties in development, including climate change, 
5
geographic distances from major markets and 
6
vulnerability to external shocks such as natural 
7
disasters. 
8
(2) The United States is a Pacific country with 
9
longstanding ties and shared values and interests 
10
with the Pacific Islands, including through the Com-
11
pacts of Free Association with the Freely Associated 
12
States, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the 
13
Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of 
14
Palau. 
15
(3) The United States has vital national secu-
16
rity interests in the Pacific Islands, including— 
17
(A) protecting regional peace and security, 
18

19
spects the sovereignty of all nations;

(4) The United States National Security Strat-
1
egy released in December 2017 outlines a United 
2
States foreign policy in the Indo-Pacific region based 
3
on strengthening alliances and partnerships old and 
4
new, promoting regional development including 
5
through fair and reciprocal trade, and maintaining a 
6
strong defense to protect regional peace and secu-
7
rity. The National Security Strategy includes a com-
8
mitment to ‘‘shore up fragile partner states in the 
9
Pacific Islands region to reduce their vulnerability to 
10
economic fluctuations and natural disasters’’. 
11
(5) At the 30th Forum Partners Dialogue of 
12
the Pacific Islands Forum held in Nauru in Sep-
13
tember 2018, then-Secretary of the Interior Ryan 
14
Zinke stated: ‘‘The United States is deeply com-
15
mitted to the security and prosperity of our friends 
16
and neighbors in the Pacific . . . We see all of the 
17
Pacific Islands as an essential part of our free and 
18
open Indo-Pacific policy . . . When the United States 
19
invests in the Pacific Islands, we do so as a partner 
20
committed to a shared future that advances national 
21
sovereignty, regional cooperation, and trust.’’. 
22
(6) The Department of Defense’s June 2019 
23
Indo-Pacific Strategy Report identified the Pacific 
24
Islands as ‘‘critical to U.S. strategy because of our 
25

shared values, interests, and commitments’’ and 
1
committed the United States to ‘‘building capacity 
2
and resilience to address maritime security; Illegal, 
3
Unreported, and Unregulated fishing; drug traf-
4
ficking; and resilience to address climate change and 
5
disaster response’’.

(7) The United States has deepened its diplo-
7
matic engagement with the Pacific Islands through 
8
several recent meetings, including— 
9
(A) a historic White House meeting be-
10
tween President Trump and the three Presi-
11
dents of the Freely Associated States on May 
12
21, 2019;

17
Wilkie’s attendance at the inauguration of 
18

19
States of Micronesia in July 2019; and 
20
(D) Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s visit 
21
to the Federated States of Micronesia in Au-
22
gust 2019.

signed by leaders of the Pacific Islands Forum in 
25
02:30 Aug 22, 2020
H7797
6 
•HR 7797 IH
2018, affirmed that climate change ‘‘remains the 
1
single greatest threat to the livelihoods, security, and 
2
wellbeing of the peoples of the Pacific’’ and asserted 
3
‘‘the sovereign right of every Member to conduct its 
4
national affairs free of external interference and co-
5
ercion’’. 
6
(9) The Asian Development Bank has estimated 
7
that the Pacific Islands region needs upwards of 
8
$2.8 billion a year in investment needs through 
9
2030, in addition to $300 million a year for climate 
10
mitigation and adaptation over the same period. 
11
(10) The Pacific Islands swiftly enacted effec-
12
tive policies to prevent and contain the spread of the 
13
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (commonly referred to as 
14
‘‘COVID–19’’) pandemic to their populations. To as-
15
sist the Pacific Islands in their response, the United 
16
States has provided over $32,000,000 in funding 
17
and coordinated its efforts with the Pacific Joint In-
18
cident Management Team. However, priorities must 
19
be met to ensure continued success in preventing the 
20
spread of the COVID–19 pandemic and long-term 
21
economic recovery in the Pacific Islands, including— 
22
(A) expanding testing capacity and acquisi-
23
tion of needed medical supplies through a reli-
24
able supply chain;

1
reopening of economic and social activities; and

(C) mitigating the impacts of lost tourism 
3
revenue and other economic damages caused by 
4
the pandemic. 
5
(11) Since 1966, thousands of Peace Corps vol-
6
unteers have proudly served in the Pacific Islands, 
7
building strong people-to-people relationships and 
8
demonstrating the United States commitment to 
9
peace and development in the region. Prior to the 
10
COVID–19 pandemic, the Peace Corps maintained 
11
presence in four Pacific Island countries. Peace 
12
Corps volunteers continue to be in high demand in 
13
the Pacific Islands and have been requested across 
14
the region.
