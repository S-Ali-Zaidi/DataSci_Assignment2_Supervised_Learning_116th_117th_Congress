To prohibit certain Federal funds from being made available 
to sanctuary jurisdictions, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as—

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

The Congress finds as follows:

•HR 3218 IH
(1) According to United States law, found at 
1
section 274 of the Immigration and Nationality Act 
2
(8 U.S.C. 1324), it is illegal to bring or harbor ille-
3
gal immigrants in our Nation. 
4
(2) In contravention of this law, cities, counties, 
5
parishes, other political subdivisions, and States in 
6
our Nation have adopted policies specifically oriented 
7
to bring in, harbor, and even attract illegal aliens 
8
into their jurisdictions. 
9
(3) Although the Federal Government, and spe-
10
cifically the Congress of the United States, is con-
11
stitutionally charged with establishing ‘‘an uniform 
12
Rule of Naturalization’’, in certain cases States and 
13
political subdivisions, including cities, have been as-
14
suming the role of immigration authorities, clearly in 
15
violation of both the Constitution and Federal stat-
16
ute. 
17
(4) Historically, the Federal Government has 
18
proven lackadaisical about enforcing its sole jurisdic-
19
tion in the serious matter of illegal immigration and 
20
taking action against those jurisdictions that know-
21
ingly or recklessly disregard the Rule of Law to con-
22
ceal, harbor, attempt to, or actually shield from de-
23
tection, such illegal aliens, or that prohibit their offi-

cers from gathering information for, or cooperating 
1
with, Federal officials. 
2
(5) In these wanton acts, such jurisdictions 
3
break the law that its citizens are held to, violate the 
4
trust of the taxpayers who are already charged with 
5
a $22 trillion dollar Government debt that grows 
6
daily, and—perhaps worst—subject those they 
7
should protect and serve to death by deliberate mur-
8
derous acts and traffic accidents by those who 
9
should not be in the country at all. 
10
(6) In this way, such jurisdictions aid and abet 
11
American deaths that are 100 percent preventable. 
12
(7) Such tragic, preventable American deaths 
13
have been suffered by ‘‘Angel Families’’ who have 
14
lost spouses, sons, daughters, grandchildren, par-
15
ents, and grandparents at the hands of illegal aliens. 
16
(8) These families are left to suffer deaths that 
17
should not have been, according to the law of the 
18
land, while too often complicit public officials, cities, 
19
States, and the Federal Government are not held ac-
20
countable. 
21
(9) Meanwhile, our Nation’s American homeless 
22
and veterans are too often left out in the cold, with-
23
out the basic necessities and care that they need and 
24
deserve as citizens of this country.

•HR 3218 IH
(10) Our American homeless and veterans must 
1
be prioritized and cared for by law and in fact. 
2
(11) Jurisdictions’ responsibilities must be 
3
taken seriously, and never aid and abet, violations of 
4
immigration law. 
5
(12) These are dual injustices that the law, as 
6
is, dictates must end.
