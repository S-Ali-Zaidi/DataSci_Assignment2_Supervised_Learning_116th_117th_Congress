SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
1
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Under the status quo, empty Federal agen-
3
cy office buildings cannot be sold by agencies that 
4
want to be efficient. Instead, each agency must let 
5
their vacant office spaces remain a purposeless and 
6
excessive cost on their balance sheets. 
7
(2) According to a 2017 Congressional Re-
8
search Service report, in fiscal year 2016, U.S. Fed-
9
eral agencies owned 3,120 buildings that were va-
10
cant or unutilized and owned another 7,859 build-
11
ings that were partially empty or underutilized. 
12
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
13
gress that— 
14
(1) Federal agencies should not be limited when 
15
placing unused or underused office space on the 
16
market for sale; and 
17
(2) Federal agencies should be able to sell their 
18
unused offices to provide for greater fiscal responsi-
19
bility and better stewardship of taxpayer dollars.
