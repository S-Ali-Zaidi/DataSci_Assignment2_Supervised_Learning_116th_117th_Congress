SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The concept and practice of nonviolent 
3
thoughts, words, and actions have a history and a 
4
legacy in the United States and the global commu-
5
nity. 
6
(2) In the 19th century, American philosophers 
7
and authors Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry 
8
David Thoreau were leaders of the transcendentalist 
9
philosophical movement which emphasized the poten-
10
tial good of humanity, the importance of truth, and 
11
the courage and power of peace. 
12
(3) In the early 20th century, Mohandas (Ma-
13
hatma) Gandhi advanced the concepts and practices 
14
of ahimsa, or non-injury, and satya, or truth as inte-
15
gral to social and active concepts and practices. 
16
(4) Gandhi continued Thoreau’s ideas of Civil 
17
Disobedience in developing the doctrine of satyagra-
18
ha which connects truth and nonviolence to active ef-
19
forts in nonviolent, civil disobedience. 
20
(5) Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., built upon 
21
these philosophies in developing six principles of 
22
nonviolence. He explained these to be a way of life 
23
which sought to build friendships and under-
24
standing, defeat injustice, accept suffering as a way 
25
to educate and transform, and to choose love instead

of hate. Nonviolence’s strength is reinforced by the 
1
universe siding with justice. 
2
(6) Rev. James E. Lawson, Jr., a leading theo-
3
rist and strategist, helped spread the philosophy and 
4
doctrine of nonviolence by organizing and teaching 
5
workshops to young activists during the American 
6
Civil Rights Movement. 
7
(7) During his Presidency, Nelson Rolihlahla 
8
Mandela expanded the spirit of ubuntu, the African 
9
philosophy of the interconnectedness, caring, shar-
10
ing, and harmony of humanity, throughout the 
11
world. 
12
(8) According to the 2019 Global Peace Index, 
13
violence cost $14,100,000,000 in constant pur-
14
chasing power parity terms or $1,853 per person in 
15
2018. The fiscal loss resulting from conflict greatly 
16
exceeds investments in peacebuilding and peace-
17
keeping. 
18
(9) Given its proven success and evolution, the 
19
philosophy and doctrine of nonviolence can and 
20
should play an important role in breaking the cycle 
21
and reducing the frequency of violence throughout 
22
the United States and as a model to the global com-
23
munity.

should be made available to Americans of all ages
