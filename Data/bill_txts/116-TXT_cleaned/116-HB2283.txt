To provide better care and outcomes for Americans living 
with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias and their 
caregivers while accelerating progress toward prevention 
strategies, disease modifying treatments, and, ultimately, 
a cure.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS; FINDINGS. 
1
(a) SHORT TITLE.—This Act may be cited as the 
2
‘‘Concentrating on High-value Alzheimer’s Needs to Get 
3
to an End Act of 2019’’ or the ‘‘CHANGE Act of 2019’’. 
4
(b) TABLE OF CONTENTS.—The table of contents of 
5
this Act is as follows: 
6
Sec. 1. Short title; table of contents; findings. 
Sec. 2. Cognitive impairment detection benefit in the Medicare annual wellness 
visit and initial preventive physical examination. 
Sec. 3. Medicare quality payment program. 
Sec. 4. Report to Congress on implementation of this Act. 
Sec. 5. Study and report on regulatory and legislative changes or refinements 
that would accelerate Alzheimer’s disease research progress. 
(c) FINDINGS.—Congress finds as follows: 
7
(1) It is estimated that 5.8 million Americans 
8
are living with Alzheimer’s disease in 2019. This in-
9
cludes an estimated 5.6 million people age 65 and 
10
older and approximately 200,000 individuals under 
11
age 65 who have younger-onset Alzheimer’s. By 
12
2050, the number of people age 65 and older with 
13
Alzheimer’s dementia is projected to increase to 13.8 
14
million Americans. 
15
(2) As many as half of the estimated 5,100,000 
16
American seniors with Alzheimer’s disease and other 
17
dementias have never received a diagnosis. 
18
(3) In 2019, it is estimated that Alzheimer’s 
19
and related dementias will have cost the Medicare 
20
and Medicaid programs $195 billion. By 2050, it is 
21
23:27 May 01, 2019
H2283

•HR 2283 IH
estimated that these direct costs will increase to as 
1
much as $1.1 trillion. 
2
(4) Alzheimer’s exacts an emotional and phys-
3
ical toll on caregivers, resulting in higher incidence 
4
of heart disease, cancer, depression, and other health 
5
consequences. 
6
(5) Alzheimer’s disease disproportionately im-
7
pacts women and people of color. Women are twice 
8
as likely to develop Alzheimer’s as they are breast 
9
cancer. African Americans are about two times more 
10
likely than White Americans to have Alzheimer’s dis-
11
ease and other dementias. Latinos are about one 
12
and one-half times more likely than White Ameri-
13
cans to have Alzheimer’s disease and other demen-
14
tias. According to the Centers for Disease Control 
15
and Prevention, among people ages 65 and older, 
16
African Americans have the highest prevalence of 
17
Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (13.8 per-
18
cent), followed by Hispanics (12.2 percent), and 
19
non-Hispanic Whites (10.3 percent), American In-
20
dian and Alaska Natives (9.1 percent), and Asian 
21
and Pacific Islanders (8.4 percent). This higher 
22
prevalence translates into a higher death rate: Alz-
23
heimer’s deaths increased 55 percent among all 
24
Americans between 1999 and 2014, while the num-
25
19:43 Apr 23, 2019
H2283

•HR 2283 IH
ber was 107 percent for Latinos and 99 percent for 
1
African Americans. 
2
(6) There are evidence-based, reliable, and 
3
NIH-identified cognitive impairment detection tools 
4
available at the National Institute on Aging’s Alz-
5
heimer’s and Dementia Resources for Professionals 
6
website that must replace detection by direct obser-
7
vation in the Medicare Annual visits and Welcome to 
8
Medicare visits. The NIH-identified tools will allow 
9
for appropriate follow-up instead of delaying diag-
10
nosis or impeding opportunities for patients to ac-
11
cess timely treatment options, including clinical trial 
12
participation. 
13
(7) An early, documented diagnosis, commu-
14
nicated to the patient and caregiver, enables early 
15
access to care planning services and available med-
16
ical and nonmedical treatments, and optimizes pa-
17
tients’ ability to build a care team, participate in 
18
support services, and enroll in clinical trials. 
19
(8) African Americans represent 13 percent of 
20
the population of the United States but only 5 per-
21
cent of clinical trial participants, and Latinos rep-
22
resent 17 percent of the population of the United 
23
States but less than one percent of clinical trial par-
24
ticipants. Further, Latinos and African Americans 
25
19:43 Apr 23, 2019
H2283
5 
•HR 2283 IH
account for only 3.5 percent and 1.2 percent, respec-
1
tively, of principal investigators supported by the 
2
National Institutes of Health funding, limiting this 
3
perspective in research. Better recruitment and trial 
4
designs are critical to addressing innovation in Alz-
5
heimer’s generally, including the underrepresentation 
6
of African Americans and Latinos. 
7
(9) Inability to identify eligible patients at the 
8
earliest stages of disease is a substantial impediment 
9
to efficient research toward Alzheimer’s disease pre-
10
vention, treatment, and cure. 
11
(10) Advancing treatment options to prevent, 
12
treat, or cure Alzheimer’s is an urgent national pri-
13
ority. 
14
(11) A paradigm shift to drive synergies be-
15
tween high-value patient care, caregiver support, 
16
brain health promotion, and research initiatives is 
17
our best hope for preventing, treating, and curing 
18
Alzheimer’s disease.
