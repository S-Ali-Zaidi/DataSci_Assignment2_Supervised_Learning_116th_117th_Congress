Congress finds that—

•HR 4143 IH
(1) short-lived climate pollutants account for 40 
1
percent of near-term global warming impacting the 
2
atmosphere, even though those pollutants account 
3
for a much smaller percentage of warming agents by 
4
weight; 
5
(2) reducing short-lived climate pollutant emis-
6
sions could— 
7
(A) cut the rate of sea-level rise by 25 per-
8
cent, according to the National Center for At-
9
mospheric Research and the Scripps Institution 
10
of Oceanography; and 
11
(B) according to the United Nations Envi-
12
ronment Programme— 
13
(i) prevent more than 2,000,000 pre-
14
mature deaths each year; 
15
(ii) prevent more than 30,000,000 
16
tons of crop losses each year; 
17
(iii) cut the rate of warming by up to 
18
0.6 degrees Celsius by 2050; and 
19
(iv) significantly contribute toward the 
20
overall global target of holding increased 
21
warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius; 
22
(3) the United States— 
23
(A) is one of the largest consumers of hy-
24
drofluorocarbons in the world; 
25
02:09 Aug 06, 2019

•HR 4143 IH
(B) provides significant innovation in the 
1
development and commercialization of low-glob-
2
al warming potential alternatives that are al-
3
ready penetrating markets worldwide; and 
4
(C) could serve as a leader and exemplar 
5
of responsibly phasing down hydrofluorocarbon 
6
production and consumption, with strong sup-
7
port from industries that formerly used hydro-
8
fluorocarbons but are transitioning quickly to 
9
lower-global warming potential alternatives; 
10
(4) the Montreal Protocol on Substances that 
11
Deplete the Ozone Layer has been an extraordinarily 
12
successful model for— 
13
(A) protecting the stratospheric ozone 
14
layer; and 
15
(B) achieving significant climate protection 
16
cobenefits; 
17
(5) since the Montreal Protocol was signed in 
18
1987, there has been an elimination of more than 95 
19
percent of ozone-depleting substances; 
20
(6) on full implementation of the Montreal Pro-
21
tocol, the ozone layer should return to pre-1980 lev-
22
els by 2050; and 
23
(7) the Interagency Strategy to Reduce Meth-
24
ane Emissions, released in March 2014, outlines a
