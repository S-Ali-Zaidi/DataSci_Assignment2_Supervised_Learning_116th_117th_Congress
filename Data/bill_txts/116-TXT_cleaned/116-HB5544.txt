17
The Administrator may, at the Administrator’s

8
(A) Production of a regulated substance 
9
without holding a production allowance that au-
10
thorizes such production. 
11
(B) Consumption of a regulated substance 
12
without holding a consumption allowance that 
13
authorizes such consumption. 
14
(C) Holding, using, or transferring any 
15
production allowance or consumption allowance 
16
allocated under this section, except in accord-
17
ance with regulations promulgated by the Ad-
18
ministrator pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2). 
19
(4) NATURE OF ALLOWANCES.—An allowance

Act or in any other provision of law shall be con-
22
strued to limit the authority of the United States to 
23
terminate or limit the authorization for the produc-
24

H5544
16 
•HR 5544 IH
tion or consumption of a regulated substance, as ap-
1
plicable, granted by the allowance. 
2
(5) COMPLIANCE.—For each year listed in table 
3
4, the Administrator shall ensure that the annual 
4
quantity of production or consumption in the United 
5
States of all regulated substances does not exceed 
6
the product obtained by multiplying the production 
7
baseline or consumption baseline, as applicable, and 
8
the applicable percentage listed in Table 4. 
9
(c) TRANSFERS.—The regulations required by sub-
10
section (b)(1) shall— 
11
(1) utilize the exchange values for each regu-
12
lated substance by or pursuant to section 3; 
13
(2) ensure that transfers of production allow-
14
ances and consumption allowances will result in 
15
greater total reductions in the annual production or 
16
consumption, as applicable, of regulated substances 
17
than would occur in that year in the absence of such 
18
transfers; and 
19
(3) authorize the transfer of production allow-
20
ances or consumption allowances among two or more 
21
persons only if the transferor and transferee are 
22
subject to an enforceable and quantifiable reduction 
23
in, respectively, annual production or consumption.
