individual will remain in detention for the duration 
1
of a national emergency. 
2
(2) PROCESS.—Not later than 7 days after the 
3
declaration of a national emergency related to a 
4
communicable disease, the Secretary shall establish 
5
a process for reviewing the immigration files of all 
6
individuals in detention who are not covered individ-
7
uals, and apply a presumption that aliens should be 
8
released based upon the need to significantly reduce 
9
the detention population due to the risk of spread of 
10
a communicable disease in congregate setting. 
11
(b) EXCEPTIONS.— 
12
(1) IN GENERAL.—In carrying out subsection 
13
(a), the Secretary— 
14
(A) may only rebut the presumption of re-
15
lease based on a credible and individualized de-
16
termination by clear and convincing evidence

(i) the use of alternatives to detention, 
19
including release on recognizance or parole, 
20
will not reasonably ensure the appearance 
21
of the individual at removal proceedings; or

23
specific and substantial risk of causing

the person of another;

(B) may not release an individual with a 
3
final order of removal entered against him or 
4
her, after all appeals have been exhausted if the 
5
removal of such alien is reasonably foreseeable; 
6
and 
7
(C) may not use the results of any deter-
8
mination under this section as evidence in any 
9
underlying immigration proceeding. 
10
(2) PENDING CRIMINAL CHARGE OR PAST CON-
11
VICTIONS.—For purposes of paragraph (1)(A), the 
12
Secretary may not justify the continued detention of 
13
an individual solely based on the fact that the indi-
14
vidual— 
15
(A) has a criminal charge pending against 
16
him or her; or 
17
(B) was convicted of a crime more than 5 
18
years previously.

(3) REASONABLY FORESEEABLE DEFINED.— 
20
(A) IN GENERAL.—For purposes of para-
21
graph (1)(C), the removal of an alien is reason-
22
ably foreseeable if the Government—

24
ments for the alien; or

convincing evidence, that such travel docu-
2
ments will likely be obtained within 10 
3
days. 
4
(B) EXCEPTION.—For purposes of para-
5
graph (1)(C), the removal of an alien is not rea-
6
sonably foreseeable if such removal is not likely 
7
during the period of the national emergency re-
8
lated to a communicable disease due to— 
9
(i) the unavailability of transportation 
10
options to the country of removal; or 
11
(ii) the refusal of the country of re-
12
moval to accept the repatriation of the 
13
alien during such period. 
14
(c) REPORT.—Not later than 180 days after the expi-
15
ration of the national emergency related to a commu-
16
nicable disease, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall 
17
submit a report to Congress that documents—

(1) the demographic data, including country of 
19
origin, race, gender, age, the status and basis of re-
20
moval proceedings, and criminal history, of the indi-
21
