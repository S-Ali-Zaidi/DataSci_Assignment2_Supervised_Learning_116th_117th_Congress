To amend the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to prohibit 
payments under such Act to States which permit ballot 
harvesting, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Election Fraud Pre-
4
vention Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) The elections clause in the United States 
8
Constitution provides the States the responsibility of

the administration of the elections process within 
1
their jurisdictions. 
2
(2) Free and fair elections are the lock and key 
3
to the democratic process in the United States and 
4
it is Congress’ duty to protect and uphold the re-
5
sponsibility of the States to conduct an election 
6
process with the utmost integrity regardless of polit-
7
ical party affiliation. 
8
(3) Depending on the State or locality, voters 
9
have the option of leaving their mail ballots in a 
10
drop box, having their ballots collected and sub-
11
mitted by a third party, or returning them at the 
12
polls or a local election office. 
13
(4) Third-party collection of ballots, which some 
14
refer to as ‘‘ballot harvesting’’, is a practice long 
15
used by special-interest groups and both major polit-
16
ical parties that is viewed either as a voter service 
17
that boosts voter turnout or an activity that has the 
18
potential to make elections vulnerable to fraud. 
19
(5) Today, several States have allowed or tried 
20
to limit ballot harvesting by restricting who can turn 
21
in another person’s ballot. Nine States allow a fam-
22
ily member to return a ballot for a voter, 27 States 
23
allow voters to designate someone to return their 
24
ballot for them, although some of these States have

placed limits on who may collect the ballots or how 
1
many they may collect, and 13 States are silent on 
2
the issue of ballot collection.
