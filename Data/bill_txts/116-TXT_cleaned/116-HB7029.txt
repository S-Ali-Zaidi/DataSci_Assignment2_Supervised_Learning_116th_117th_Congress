A BILL 
To facilitate the re-opening of schools through study of chil-
dren’s role in transmitting SARS–CoV–2, and for other 
purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Protect our Children 
4
from COVID–19 Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) School closures have substantial negative ef-
8
fects on children’s education, mental health, and so-
9
cial development.

(2) In general, school closures compound in-
1
equalities in rural and low-income communities, 
2
where students often lack access to computers and 
3
high-speed internet. 
4
(3) Returning children to the classroom will not 
5
only facilitate their development, but also free up 
6
their adult caregivers as they return to work. 
7
(4) To date, scientific evidence suggests chil-
8
dren have a lower probability of developing a serious 
9
illness from COVID–19 than adults. It remains un-
10
clear, however, what role children play in transmit-
11
ting SARS–CoV–2. 
12
(5) Pursuing research that analyzes and under-
13
stands the transmissibility of SARS–CoV–2 in chil-
14
dren will help families, educators, and elected lead-
15
ers make better decisions on re-opening schools and 
16
our economy.
