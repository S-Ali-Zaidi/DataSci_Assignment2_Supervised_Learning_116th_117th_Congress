RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
immigration makes the United States stronger. 
Whereas President Reagan said that you can go to live in 
France, but you cannot become a Frenchman, or you can 
go to live in Germany, Turkey, or Japan, but you cannot 
become a German, a Turk, or a Japanese, but anyone, 
from any corner of the Earth, can come to live in the 
United States and become an American; 
Whereas the torch of Lady Liberty symbolizes our freedom 
and represents our heritage, the compact with our par-
ents, our grandparents, and our ancestors, and gives us 
our great and special place in the world; 
Whereas it is the great life force of each generation of new 
Americans that guarantees that the United States tri-
umph shall continue unsurpassed into the coming century 
and beyond; 
Whereas other countries may seek to compete with us, but in 
one vital area—as a beacon of freedom and opportunity 
that draws the people of the world—no country on Earth 
comes close; 
Whereas this is one of the most important sources of the 
greatness of the United States—we lead the world be-
cause, unique among nations, we draw our people, our 
strength, from every country and every corner of the 
world, and by doing so we continuously renew and enrich 
our Nation; 
Whereas while other countries cling to the stale past, here in 
the United States we breathe life into dreams, we create 
the future and the world follows us into tomorrow;

Whereas thanks to each wave of new arrivals to this land of 
opportunity, we’re a Nation forever young, forever burst-
ing with energy and new ideas, and always on the cutting 
edge, always leading the world to the next frontier; 
Whereas if we ever closed the door to new Americans, our 
leadership in the world would soon be lost; 
Whereas it is bold men and women, yearning for freedom and 
opportunity, who leave their homelands and come to a 
new country to start their lives over, believing in the 
American dream, and over and over making it come true 
for themselves, for their children, and for others; 
Whereas immigrants give more than they receive—they labor 
and succeed, often as entrepreneurs, but their greatest 
contribution is more than economic, because they under-
stand in a special way how glorious it is to be an Amer-
ican; and 
Whereas they renew our pride and gratitude in the United 
States, the greatest, freest Nation in the world—the last, 
best hope of men and women on Earth: Now, therefore, 
be it

(2) is committed to keeping the United States 
1
open to those lawfully seeking refuge and asylum

3
the American dream, no matter their race, faith, or 
4
country of origin; 
5
(3) recognizes that the Federal Government has 
6
a duty to secure our borders, and that patriotic

8
within the boundaries set by our Constitution, our 
9
laws, and our ideals as a Nation of immigrants; 
10
(4) rejects the hateful propaganda of White su-
11
premacist terrorists, including those who committed 
12
the massacres of Jewish people at Pittsburgh’s Tree 
13

Christchurch, New Zealand, that immigrants to our 
15
country or to other countries are ‘‘invaders’’ or that 
16
they pose any intrinsic threat to society; 
17
(5) condemns political leaders who legitimize 
18
White supremacist ideology by echoing claims of an 
19
immigrant invasion, by falsely alleging that our fel-
20
low Americans who are immigrants and refugees 
21
commit more crimes or contribute less to our society 
22
than native born citizens, or by spreading conspiracy 
23
theories about the law enforcement and intelligence

agencies seeking to protect every American;

tice Department, including the Federal Bureau of

Investigation, the Department of Homeland Secu-
3
rity, and State and local law enforcement agencies,

tional steps to remove extremist content from their
