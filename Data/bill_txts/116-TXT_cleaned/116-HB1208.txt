A BILL 
To amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to waive 
certain requirements for naturalization for American Sa-
moan United States nationals to become United States 
citizens, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. WAIVER OF CERTAIN NATURALIZATION RE-
3
QUIREMENTS 
FOR 
AMERICAN 
SAMOAN 
4
UNITED STATES NATIONALS TO BECOME 
5
UNITED STATES CITIZENS.

(a) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds the following:

H1208
2 
•HR 1208 IH
(1) Under the Immigration and Nationality 
1
Act, persons born in Puerto Rico, Guam, the United 
2
States Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of the 
3
Northern Mariana Islands are citizens of the United 
4
States at birth. Persons born in the United States 
5
territory of American Samoa are nationals of the 
6
United States, but not citizens, at birth. 
7
(2) The term ‘‘national of the United States’’ 
8
is defined under the Immigration and Nationality 
9
Act to include persons who, though not citizens of 
10
the United States, owe permanent allegiance to the 
11
United States. 
12
(3) For more than 100 years, American 
13
Samoans who are United States nationals have dem-
14
onstrated their loyalty and allegiance to the United 
15
States. On April 17, 1900, the village chiefs of 
16
Tutuila and Aunu’u ceded their islands to the 
17
United States. On July 16, 1904, his Majesty King 
18
Tuimanu’a of the Manu’a Islands and his village 
19
chiefs did the same. On February 20, 1929, the 
20
Congress officially ratified the Treaty of Cession of 
21
Tutuila and Aunu’u and the Treaty of Cession of 
22
Manu’a. On March 4, 1925, by Joint Resolution of 
23
the Congress, American sovereignty was officially ex-
24
tended over Swains Island and it was placed under 
25

•HR 1208 IH
the jurisdiction of the government of American 
1
Samoa. 
2
(4) Since ratification of the Treaties of Cession, 
3
many American Samoans who are United States na-
4
tionals have joined the United States Armed Forces 
5
and fought for the United States during World War 
6
II, the Korean, Vietnam, and Persian Gulf wars, 
7
and most recently in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
8
(5) However, in order for American Samoans 
9
who are United States nationals to become United 
10
States citizens, they must follow the same procedure 
11
as aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence. 
12
This procedure requires, among other steps, an ap-
13
plication, fingerprinting, an interview, an English 
14
language and civics examination, and participation 
15
in an oath ceremony. The procedure may take years 
16
to complete. 
17
(6) Given that American Samoa’s education 
18
system is structured to closely resemble that of pub-
19
lic schools in the United States, that courses on 
20
United States history, civics, and government are 
21
thoroughly taught, that English is the language of 
22
public school instruction, and that United States na-
23
tionals by definition owe permanent allegiance to the 
24
United States, it is in the national interest that 
25

United States nationals be allowed to become United 
1
States citizens by more expeditious means.
