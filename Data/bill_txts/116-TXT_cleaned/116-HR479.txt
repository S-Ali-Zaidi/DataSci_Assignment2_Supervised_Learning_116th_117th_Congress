RESOLUTION 
Seeking the return of the USS Pueblo to the United States 
Navy. 
Whereas the USS Pueblo, which was attacked and captured 
by the navy of North Korea on January 23, 1968, was 
the first ship of the United States Navy to be hijacked 
on the high seas by a foreign military force in more than 
150 years; 
Whereas 1 member of the USS Pueblo crew, Petty Officer 
Duane Hodges, was killed in the assault, while the other 
82 crew members were held in captivity, often under in-
humane conditions, for 11 months; 
Whereas the USS Pueblo, an intelligence collection auxiliary 
vessel, was operating in international waters at the time 
of the capture, and therefore did not violate the terri-
torial waters of North Korea;

als against the Government or people of North Korea and

ment of North Korea for more than 50 years, was sub-

capital city of North Korea: Now, therefore, be it
