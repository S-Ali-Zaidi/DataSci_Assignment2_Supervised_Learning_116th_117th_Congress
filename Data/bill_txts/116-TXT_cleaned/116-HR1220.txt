Whereas there are far too many unparented children in the 
United States; 
Whereas the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Report-
ing System Report on fiscal year 2019 foster care and 
adoption population characteristics indicates that, in the 
United States— 
(1) there are approximately 424,000 children in the 
foster care system, approximately 122,200 of whom are 
waiting for adoption; 
(2) 65 percent of the children in foster care are 10 
years of age or younger; 
(3) the average length of time a child spends in fos-
ter care is approximately 20 months; 
(4) during fiscal year 2019, approximately 20,400 
youth ‘‘aged out’’ of foster care by reaching adulthood 
without being placed in a permanent home; and 
(5) during fiscal year 2019, the number of children 
who— 
(A) achieved permanency through adoption in-
creased for the fifth year in a row; and 
(B) entered foster care decreased for the third 
year in a row; 
Whereas still, for many foster children, the wait for a loving 
family in which they are nurtured, comforted, and pro-
tected seems endless; 
Whereas a survey conducted in 2019 showed that— 
(1) 21 percent of respondents had considered or 
were considering adoption; 
(2) about 1⁄2 of respondents viewed adoption through 
the foster care system favorably; and 
(3) of the respondents who had not considered adop-

(A) 20 percent believed that they could not af-
ford adoption; and 
(B) 18 percent believed that they would be un-
prepared for the emotional or health needs of an 
adopted child; 
Whereas the Children’s Bureau, an office of the Administra-
tion for Children and Families within the Department of 
Health and Human Services, supports programs, re-
search, and monitoring to help eliminate barriers to 
adoption and find permanent families for children; 
Whereas, every day, loving and nurturing families are 
strengthened and expanded when committed and dedi-
cated individuals make an important difference in the life 
of a child through adoption; 
Whereas the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID–19) pandemic 
has presented unprecedented challenges to the United 
States, the foster care system, prospective adoptive par-
ents, and the children awaiting permanency; 
Whereas the President traditionally issues an annual procla-
mation to declare the month of November as National 
Adoption Month, and the President has proclaimed No-
vember 2020 as National Adoption Month; 
Whereas National Adoption Day has been celebrated as a col-
lective national effort to find permanent and loving fami-
lies for children in the foster care system; and 
Whereas the Saturday before Thanksgiving has been recog-
nized as National Adoption Day since at least 2000, and, 
in 2020, the Saturday before Thanksgiving is November 
21: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
