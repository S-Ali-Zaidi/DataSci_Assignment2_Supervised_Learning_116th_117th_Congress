RESOLUTION 
Condemning the attacks on peaceful protesters and sup-
porting an immediate peaceful transition to a civilian- 
led democratic government in Sudan. 
Whereas in 2016, the Government of the United States 
launched a plan aimed at reducing conflict and expanding 
humanitarian access in Sudan, improving counterter-
rorism cooperation, ending Sudan’s negative interference 
in South Sudan, and addressing the threat of the Lord’s 
Resistance Army, that, according to the Department of 
State, led to significant progress in these areas and re-
sulted in the lifting of some United States sanctions on 
Sudan in October 2017; 
Whereas the Department of State announced ‘‘Phase II’’ of 
the bilateral reengagement framework with Sudan in No-

vember 2018, under which the United States would con-
sider rescinding Sudan’s designation as a state sponsor 
of terrorism if the country met the relevant statutory cri-
teria for delisting and if the Government of Sudan made 
progress along six identified areas of concern related to 
counterterrorism cooperation, humanitarian access, re-
spect for human rights, a cessation of internal hostilities 
and a conducive environment for peace processes, efforts 
to address outstanding terrorism-related legal claims, and 
adherence to United Nations Security Council resolutions 
on North Korea; 
Whereas despite the Government of Sudan’s pledge to cease 
hostilities, the United Nations Panel of Experts on the 
Sudan reported in January 2019 that forces of the Gov-
ernment of Sudan had launched ‘‘large-scale military op-
erations’’ against insurgents in the Jebel Marra region of 
Darfur in 2018 and that elements of Sudan’s Rapid Sup-
port Forces and associated militia were implicated in in-
discriminate shootings, rape, acts of torture, and other 
inhumane treatment of civilians; 
Whereas the Department of State’s country reports on 
human rights practices describe reports of serious human 
rights violations by Sudan’s intelligence service and mili-
tary, including the Rapid Support Forces, citing credible 
reports that villages in Jebel Marra were targeted for at-
tack in 2018, resulting in the displacement of thousands 
of civilians and noting that Sudan’s Rapid Support 
Forces were implicated in the majority of reported 
human rights violations against civilians in the country; 
Whereas contrary to the requirements of Phase II, humani-
tarian organizations report that humanitarian access re-
strictions have persisted, including bureaucratic inter-

ference, and reports of serious human rights abuses and 
media censorship increased after Phase II was launched; 
Whereas in December 2018, protests that began in Damazin 
and Atbara spread across the country, with thousands of 
Sudanese gathering to demand political change; 
Whereas the Government of Sudan responded to the protests 
by detaining hundreds of people, including protesters, 
members of the political opposition, civil society, journal-
ists, and more than a dozen American citizens, and by 
using excessive and lethal force against protesters, killing 
more than 100 people since the demonstrations began; 
Whereas in late February 2019, President Bashir declared a 
yearlong nationwide state of emergency, dissolving the 
Federal and State governments and appointing senior 
military officers to key government posts, banning unau-
thorized gatherings, demonstrations, and strikes, expand-
ing authorization for searches, seizures, and arrests, and 
barring news deemed to undermine his government; 
Whereas tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of protesters 
gathered in Khartoum on April 6, 2019, calling for the 
end of the government of President Bashir, and on April 
11, 2019, he was ousted from power by the military and 
replaced by Defense Minister and First Vice President 
Lt. Gen. Ahmed Awad Ibn Auf, who later ceded power 
to Military Inspector General and Army Chief Lt. Gen. 
Abdel Fattah al-Burhan; 
Whereas Lt. Gen. Burhan has stated that his Transitional 
Military Council is committed to transferring power to a 
civilian government, but the Council has yet to reach con-
sensus with opposition representatives on a transitional 
arrangement;

Whereas protesters have maintained their vigil in Khartoum, 
despite the reported arrest of Bashir, calling for the mili-
tary to transfer power to a civilian-led transitional au-
thority that will end Sudan’s civil wars, address the coun-
try’s economic crisis, and lay the foundations for demo-
cratic elections; 
Whereas the delay by the Transitional Military Council in 
meeting the demands of the protesters and the African 
Union Peace and Security Council to ‘‘step aside and 
hand over power to a civilian-led transitional authority, 
in accordance with the will of the people and constitu-
tional order’’, has led to rising tensions; 
Whereas negotiations between the Transitional Military 
Council and the opposition coalition, known as the Forces 
for Freedom and Change, on the composition and powers 
of a transitional government are complicated by the role 
of individuals in the Military Council who have been ac-
cused of war crimes, by the Council’s insistence on Is-
lamic Sharia law as the basis for laws, and by security 
forces use of live fire against protesters in the cities of 
Nyala, Zalingei, and Khartoum, resulting in multiple 
deaths, during the talks; and 
Whereas in the Comprehensive Peace in Sudan Act of 2004, 
Congress expressed its sense that individuals found to be 
involved in the planning or carrying out of genocide, war 
crimes, or crimes against humanity should not hold lead-
ership positions in the Government of Sudan: Now, there-
fore, be it
