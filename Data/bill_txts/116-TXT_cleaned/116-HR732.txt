killed 22 people in El Paso, Texas; 
Whereas, on October 9, 2019, a White supremacist extremist 
killed 2 people in Halle, Germany; 
Whereas the easy dissemination of White supremacist extrem-
ist content through online platforms has accelerated the 
internationalization of hateful ideologies, exacerbated 
radicalization, and contributed to the establishment of an 
insidious global network; 
Whereas, in March 2019, the United Nations recognized the 
International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimi-
nation with the theme of ‘‘Mitigating and countering ris-
ing nationalist populism and extreme supremacist 
ideologies’’; 
Whereas, in May 2019, France and New Zealand convened 
the Christchurch Call to Action Summit, producing a 
pledge supported by 48 countries underscoring the ‘‘ur-
gent need for action and enhanced cooperation among the 
wide range of actors with influence over this issue, in-
cluding governments, civil society, and online service pro-
viders, such as social media companies, to eliminate ter-
rorist and violent extremist content online.’’; 
Whereas, in September 2019, the Department of Homeland 
Security published the Strategic Framework for Coun-
tering Terrorism and Targeted Violence, identifying

•HRES 732 IH 
White supremacist extremism as ‘‘one of the most potent 
forces driving domestic terrorism’’; 
Whereas White supremacist extremism is a danger to the 
peace and security of democratic peoples around the 
world; 
Whereas additional and related forms of discrimination, intol-
erance, and repression around the world, such as xeno-
phobia, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, autocracy, sexism, 
homophobia, nationalism, and others, contradict universal 
principles of freedom and equality; 
Whereas a champion of liberal values, the United States has 
long fought to uphold domestically and around the world 
the creed of the Declaration of Independence, which pro-
claimed at our Nation’s founding, ‘‘We hold these truths 
to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that 
they are endowed by their Creator with certain 
unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty 
and the pursuit of Happiness.’’; 
Whereas the scourge of White supremacist extremism around 
the world must be denounced unequivocally; and 
Whereas relevant parties, including governments, social media 
companies, and civil society organizations, have a respon-
sibility to combat White supremacist extremism: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—

(1) expresses condolences to the victims of

White supremacist extremism and their families;
