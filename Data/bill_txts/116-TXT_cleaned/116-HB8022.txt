Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Lobbying Disclosure

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds that— 
7
(1) the right to petition government for redress 
8
of grievances is a fundamental right in our rep-
9
resentative democracy, which is often realized 
10
through lobbying; 
11
(2) responsible representative government re-
12
quires public awareness of the efforts of paid lobby-
13
ists to influence the public decision making process 
14
in both the legislative and executive branches of the 
15
Federal Government; 
16
(3) existing lobbying disclosure laws have not 
17
been as effective as they could be because of unclear 
18
statutory language, weak administrative and enforce-
19
ment provisions, and an absence of clear guidance as 
20
to who is required to register and what they are re-
21
quired to disclose; 
22
(4) the effective public disclosure of the identity 
23
and extent of the efforts of paid lobbyists to influ-
24
ence Federal officials in the conduct of government 
25

•HR 8022 IH
actions will increase public confidence in the integ-
1
rity of government; and 
2
(5) experience with lobbying laws and regula-
3
tions for nearly a half century led to substantial im-
4
provements in the law in 1995, and experience with 
5
the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 over the last 
6
decade provides a sound basis for new refinements 
7
today.
