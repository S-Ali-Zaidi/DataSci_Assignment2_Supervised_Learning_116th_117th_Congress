SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforce-
3
ment repatriated or attempted to repatriate dozens 
4
of foreign nationals who tested positive for SARS– 
5
CoV–2 prior to departure from the United States or 
6
upon arrival in their country of destination. 
7
(2) Haiti is one of the most vulnerable nations 
8
in the world to SARS–CoV–2 with only a few dozen 
9
ventilators for 11 million people. Yet, in April 2020, 
10
multiple individuals who were repatriated or other-
11
wise removed to Haiti on a single flight tested posi-
12
tive for SARS–CoV–2 upon their arrival. In May, 
13
U.S. 
Immigration 
and 
Customs 
Enforcement 
14
planned to repatriate more than 100 individuals to 
15
Haiti, including individuals known to have COVID– 
16
19, but abandoned these plans after media scrutiny 
17
and pressure from the Haitian government. 
18
(3) As of mid-May 2020, more than 100 indi-
19
viduals have tested positive for SARS–CoV–2 upon 
20
arrival in Guatemala, prompting Guatemala to sus-
21
pend repatriation flights from the United States on 
22
several occasions. 
23
(4) U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforce-
24
ment’s patchwork approach to the screening and 
25
testing of deportees prior to repatriation has failed,
