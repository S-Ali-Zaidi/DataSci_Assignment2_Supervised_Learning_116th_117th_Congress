A BILL

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Pandemic Essential 
2
Supplies Act’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) The global shortage of medical and sanita-
6
tion supplies due to the COVID–19 pandemic has 
7
paralyzed health care systems and strained emer-
8
gency response capabilities of governments around 
9
the world. 
10
(2) The pandemic demonstrated the inter-
11
dependent nature and the limitations of global sup-
12
ply chains as both our nation and the world com-
13
petes for a finite number of suppliers for critical 
14
medical and sanitation resources. 
15
(3) Providing a comprehensive understanding of 
16
how to procure, manage, deliver, and sustain at scale 
17
was necessary during this crisis, and will be critical 
18
as the U.S. replenishes current supplies and plans 
19
for future crises. 
20
(4) The Federal Emergency Management Agen-
21
cy and the Department of Health and Human Serv-
22
ices were challenged to rapidly identify, procure and 
23
deploy large quantities of goods and services while 
24
simultaneously responding and planning for the re-
25

•HR 8562 IH
covery of the United States from this global pan-
1
demic. 
2
(5) The traditional interagency emergency re-
3
sponse structure, built to respond to natural disas-
4
ters typically defined by geographic locales, does not 
5
have the capacity to scale quickly to address a crisis 
6
of this magnitude. 
7
(6) The Department of Defense leveraged ac-
8
quisition and supply chain expertise are uniquely 
9
suited to rapidly scale and establish acquisition 
10
strategies, for both procurement of supplies, expan-
11
sion of industrial capabilities and distribution of 
12
such supplies as the COVID–19 response require-
13
ments evolved. 
14
(7) As the combat logistics support agency for 
15
the Nation, the Defense Logistics Agency (‘‘DLA’’) 
16
manages the global supply chain—from raw mate-
17
rials to end user to disposition—for the Army, Ma-
18
rine Corps, Navy, Air Force, Space Force, Coast 
19
Guard, 11 combatant commands, other Federal 
20
agencies, and partner and allied nations. 
21
(8) DLA has supported the COVID–19 re-
22
sponse of the Department of Defense by increasing 
23
the production and acquisition of critical items 
24
02:55 Nov 01, 2020
H8562
4 
•HR 8562 IH
through existing large-scale contracts across multiple 
1
supply chains. 
2
(9) As a logistics integrator and acquisition and 
3
service provider, DLA has the unique capability to 
4
manage the supply chain that few other organiza-
5
tions, public or private, can match to assist States, 
6
local governments, hospitals, and health care pro-
7
viders around the country with supplies so they are 
8
not needlessly competing against one another. 
9
(10) Additionally, the COVID–19 Joint Acqui-
10
sition Task Force (‘‘JATF’’), established by the Un-
11
dersecretary 
of 
Defense 
for 
Acquisition 
and 
12
Sustainment, plays a critical role in the national re-
13
sponse to the COVID–19 pandemic. 
14
(11) The JATF’s understanding of reliance on 
15
foreign suppliers, often many tiers down in the sup-
16
ply chain, and the impact of that reliance on pro-
17
ducing at scale has allowed the Secretary of Health 
18
and Human Services to better plan for replenish-
19
ment of the Strategic National Stockpile. 
20
(12) DLA should provide direct support for 
21
States during the COVID–19 pandemic and future 
22
emergencies. 
23
(13) DLA can identify private sector capacity 
24
and assess additional needs for rapid mass produc-

tion a COVID–19 vaccine in advance of approval by 
1
the Federal Drug Administration of such vaccine. 
2
(14) The Secretary of Defense should be pre-
3
pared to reconvene the JATF to support future 
4
emergencies such as COVID–19.
