RESOLUTION 
Calling on Congress to condemn voter suppression laws 
enacted by States and political subdivisions. 
Whereas the ratification of the 15th Amendment in 1870 af-
firms that voting rights cannot be denied to citizens on 
the basis of race; 
Whereas post-Reconstruction Jim Crow laws severely re-
stricted minority voting rights, particularly those of Afri-
can Americans; 
Whereas the Voting Rights Act of 1965 contributed to a sig-
nificant increase in voter registration and participation 
by African Americans and other minorities; 
Whereas the Supreme Court’s 2013 decision in Shelby Coun-
ty v. Holder struck down section 4(b) of the Voting 
Rights Act of 1965, the coverage provision of the law

that identified States and political subdivisions with a 
chronic history of passing restrictive voting laws; 
Whereas the Shelby County decision effectively immobilized 
section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which allowed 
the Department of Justice and Federal courts to 
‘‘preclear’’ any proposed changes to voting rules, allowing 
a preemptive strike of unjust and discriminatory voting 
laws in the regions identified by section 4(b); 
Whereas the absence of this preclearance requirement has al-
lowed for voter suppression laws to proliferate by permit-
ting States and political subdivisions to pass restrictive 
voting laws without Federal preclearance to determine if 
the laws are racially discriminatory; 
Whereas following the Shelby County decision, at least 14 
States had voting restrictions in place for the first time 
in a Presidential election in time for the 2016 contest; 
Whereas approximately 11 percent of American citizens lack 
government-issued photo identification, and a dispropor-
tionate number are low-income, elderly, or people of 
color; 
Whereas African Americans are as much as 305 percent and 
Latinos are as much as 195 percent more likely than 
Whites to lack acceptable identification required to vote; 
Whereas since the Shelby County decision, at least 4 States 
have reduced early voting access; 
Whereas restricting early voting disproportionately affects 
people of color, low-income citizens, and the elderly, who 
often rely on flexible, early voting periods; 
Whereas many voting-eligible, low-income Latino voters are 
naturalized United States citizens who lack proof of citi-
zenship and cannot afford a Certificate of Citizenship or

a Replacement Certificate of Naturalization, which cost 
$1,170 and $555, respectively; 
Whereas since the Shelby County decision, at least 2 States 
have imposed more stringent requirements on nongovern-
mental organizations that help register and engage citi-
zens in voter participation; 
Whereas restricting nongovernmental voter participation or-
ganizations directly affects people of color, low-income 
citizens, and the elderly, as these organizations are par-
ticularly likely to reach and engage these populations; 
Whereas since the Shelby County decision, at least 5 States 
have passed laws making it more difficult to vote by ab-
sentee ballot; 
Whereas reducing absentee voting disproportionately affects 
low-income, minority voters, who are more likely than 
other citizens to have inflexible work- and childcare-re-
lated schedules; 
Whereas in addition to State-level voter suppression laws, po-
litical subdivisions have also passed new laws that sup-
press minority voters, including reducing the number of 
polling places and offering insufficient language assist-
ance for non-English-speaking voters; 
Whereas following the Shelby County decision, there were at 
least 868 fewer polling places in the 2016 election than 
in past elections; 
Whereas insufficient language assistance at polling places 
could possibly threaten eligible Latino voter turnout in 
the 2020 Presidential election; 
Whereas since the Shelby County decision, courts have struck 
down restrictive voting laws in at least 4 States, dem-

onstrating the discriminatory nature of voting restrictions 
that have proliferated post-Shelby County; 
Whereas had a preclearance formula been in effect, the De-
partment of Justice and Federal courts would have been 
able to prevent discriminatory voter suppression laws 
from being passed; 
Whereas the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of 
Representatives has favorably reported the Voting Rights 
Advancement Act of 2019 (H.R. 4), to update and re-
store the Voting Rights Act of 1965; and 
Whereas many unjust voter laws that were passed or went 
into effect after the Shelby County decision threaten to 
affect a significant number of minority voters in upcom-
ing elections: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives con-
1
demns the use by States and political subdivisions of the 
2
voter suppression laws and techniques described in the 
3
preamble of this resolution.
