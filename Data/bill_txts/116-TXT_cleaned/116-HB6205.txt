•HR 6205 IH
(1) In recognition that trade policy can result 
1
in disparate and disruptive changes to the economy, 
2
the Trade Adjustment Assistance program was en-
3
acted to help workers adversely impacted by global 
4
trade. 
5
(2) The Coronavirus Disease (COVID–19) has 
6
severely disrupted global supply chains due to Chi-
7
na’s role as the main supplier of intermediate out-
8
puts for manufacturing companies around the world. 
9
A drop in the Chinese supply of these inputs nega-
10
tively impacts production for American manufactur-
11
ers. 
12
(3) COVID–19 has also depressed cargo vol-
13
umes at major ports in the United States and closed 
14
off certain foreign markets to American exporters. 
15
(4) Workers adversely impacted by these effects 
16
deserve access to trade adjustment assistance.
