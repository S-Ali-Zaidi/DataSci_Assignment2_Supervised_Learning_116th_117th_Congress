RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the designation of July 22, 2020, 
as ‘‘Glioblastoma Awareness Day’’. 
Whereas more than 13,000 new cases of glioblastoma will be 
diagnosed in the United States in 2020; 
Whereas glioblastoma is— 
(1) the most common malignant (cancerous) brain 
tumor, accounting for 48 percent of all primary malig-
nant brain tumors; and 
(2) the most aggressive, complex, difficult to treat, 
and deadly type of brain tumor; 
Whereas it is estimated that more than 10,000 individuals in 
the United States will succumb to glioblastoma every 
year;

Whereas the 5-year survival rate for glioblastoma patients is 
only 6.8 percent, and the average length of survival for 
glioblastoma patients is estimated to be only 12 to 18 
months; 
Whereas glioblastoma is described as a disease that affects 
the ‘‘essence of self’’, as the treatment and removal of 
glioblastoma presents significant challenges due to the 
uniquely complex and fragile nature of the brain, the pri-
mary organ in the human body that controls not only 
cognitive ability, but also the actions of every organ and 
limb; 
Whereas, relative to other types of cancers, brain cancer 
has— 
(1) the highest per-patient initial cost of care, with 
an annualized mean net cost of care approaching 
$150,000; and 
(2) the highest annualized mean net costs for last- 
year-of-life care, with a cost of between $135,000 and 
$210,000 per patient, depending on the age and gender 
of a patient; 
Whereas, although research advances may fuel the develop-
ment of new treatments for glioblastoma, challenging ob-
stacles to accelerating progress toward new treatments 
for glioblastoma remain, and there are no screening or 
early detection methods; 
Whereas, although glioblastoma was first described in medical 
and scientific literature in the 1920s, and despite its dev-
astating prognosis, only 4 drugs and 1 medical device 
have been approved by the Food and Drug Administra-
tion to treat glioblastoma since the 1920s, and the mor-
tality rates associated with glioblastoma have changed lit-
tle during the past 30 years; and

•HRES 1004 IH 
Whereas there is a need for greater public awareness of glio-
blastoma, including awareness of both— 
(1) the urgent unmet medical needs of glioblastoma 
patients; and 
(2) the opportunities for research and treatment ad-
vances for glioblastoma: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the designation of ‘‘Glioblastoma 
2
Awareness Day’’; 
3
(2) encourages increased public awareness of 
4
glioblastoma; 
5
(3) honors the individuals who have lost their 
6
lives to glioblastoma, a devastating disease, or are 
7
currently living with it; 
8
(4) supports efforts to develop better treat-
9
ments for glioblastoma that will improve the long- 
10
term prognosis of individuals diagnosed with glio-
11
blastoma; 
12
(5) expresses its support for the individuals who 
13
are battling brain tumors, as well as the families, 
14
friends, and caregivers of those individuals; and 
15
(6) urges a collaborative approach to brain 
16
tumor research, which is a promising means of ad-
17
vancing the understanding and treatment of glio-
18
blastoma.
