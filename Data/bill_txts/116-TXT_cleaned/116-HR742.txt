RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the continued success of the Food for Peace 
Act. 
Whereas, on July 10, 1954, President Dwight D. Eisenhower 
signed the Agricultural Trade Development and Assist-
ance Act which created the Office of Food for Peace; 
Whereas the purpose of the Office of Food for Peace is to 
promote democratic values abroad, advance freedom and 
peace, and help to alleviate humanitarian crises through-
out the world; 
Whereas the 2018 Global Nutrition Report reveals that 
150,800,000 children under 5 years old worldwide are 
stunted as a result of malnutrition, 50,500,000 are se-

verely malnourished, and 20,000,000 babies a year are 
born underweight; 
Whereas 16,400,000 children under 5 years old suffer from 
severe acute malnutrition (SAM) and require life-chang-
ing, ready-to-use therapeutic foods (RUTF), and Food 
for Peace is a major contributor to the United Nations 
Children’s Fund (UNICEF) for the purchase of RUTF, 
helping UNICEF reach more than 4,100,000 children 
with treatment for SAM in 2018, and supporting RUTF 
needs in 31 countries around the world; 
Whereas undernutrition contributes to approximately 45 per-
cent of deaths of children under 5 years old worldwide; 
Whereas large numbers of vulnerable and chronically food-in-
secure people reside in war-torn areas including Syria, 
South Sudan, Somalia, Nigeria, and Yemen; 
Whereas the United Nations Refugee Agency estimates that 
6,600,000 people have been internally displaced in Syria, 
including 2,500,000 children, and 11,700,000 people are 
in urgent need of humanitarian assistance which includes 
6,500,000 food-insecure people; 
Whereas the United Nations Refugee Agency estimates that 
4,800,000 people have been displaced by the ongoing con-
flict in Yemen, and more than 24,000,000 Yemenis are 
in urgent need of humanitarian assistance, including over 
20,000,000 in need of food; 
Whereas the United Nations Refugee Agency estimates that 
15,000,000 Yemenis are on the brink of starvation and 
400,000 children are suffering from extreme malnutri-
tion; 
Whereas up to 7,100,000 people in South Sudan require hu-
manitarian assistance, nearly all of whom are facing

acute food insecurity and need lifesaving aid provided by 
the United States Agency for International Development 
(USAID) and other international donors; 
Whereas approximately 2,100,000 people in Somalia are in 
need of emergency food assistance due to high levels of 
food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or higher) with the most 
affected areas including Awdal, Bari, Galgaduud, and 
Hiiraan; 
Whereas Nigeria, with the largest economy in Africa, still ex-
periences massive income inequality, and almost half its 
population, more than 91,000,000 people, live in extreme 
poverty, and 3,000,000 people are severely food-insecure; 
Whereas nearly half of children under 5 years old in Guate-
mala are stunted due to malnutrition, and in some areas 
the percentage is much higher, making it the highest in 
the region; 
Whereas Latin America and the Caribbean are most vulner-
able to a range of natural hazards including droughts, 
earthquakes, forest fires, floods, hurricanes, and volcanic 
eruptions which require robust humanitarian assistance, 
including food aid; 
Whereas hundreds of thousands of people who have fled Ven-
ezuela are now facing serious food shortages and other 
hardships, which risk both lives and the stability of the 
region; 
Whereas women and children are disproportionately affected 
by food shortages and political instability; 
Whereas the assistance provided by Food for Peace programs 
helps to address the root causes of mass migration of 
populations from poverty-stricken and food-insecure re-
gions;

and the United Nations World Food Programme has led 
to millions of people receiving critical food aid around the 
world; and 
Whereas the largest recipients of Food for Peace aid in 2018 
were the conflict-torn regions of Somalia, Ethiopia, 
Yemen, South Sudan, and Syria, all of which have large 
populations of refugees and other displaced persons 
whose lives have been irrevocably shattered by war and 
its aftermath: Now, therefore, be it
