RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the Government of the People’s Republic of China made 
multiple, serious mistakes in the early stages of the 
COVID–19 outbreak that heightened the severity and 
spread of the ongoing COVID–19 pandemic, which in-
clude the Chinese Government’s intentional spread of 
misinformation to downplay the risks of the virus, a 
refusal to cooperate with international health authorities,

internal censorship of doctors and journalists, and mali-

Whereas, on December 31, 2019, Wuhan Central Hospital 
authorities formally reprimanded Fei for ‘‘spreading ru-
mors’’ about the virus; 
Whereas, on January 1, 2020, an official at the Hubei Pro-
vincial Health Commission ordered at least one private 
genomics testing company to cease testing samples of a 
SARS-like virus from Wuhan and to destroy all existing 
samples of the virus; 
Whereas, on January 3, 2020, Wuhan’s Public Security Bu-
reau detained, questioned and forced Dr. Li Wenliang 
and seven other doctors to sign a letter confessing he had 
made ‘‘false comments’’ that ‘‘severely disturbed the so-
cial order’’; 
Whereas, on January 3, 2020, the leading public health au-
thority in China, the National Health Commission, di-
rected all Chinese research institutions to cease publicly 
publishing any information related to a then unknown 
SARS-like virus, and ordered them to destroy existing

missibility of COVID–19 on January 1, 2020; 
Whereas, on January 18, 2020, over 10,000 families attended

Whereas, on February 7, 2020, one month after checking 
into Wuhan Central Hospital, Dr. Li Wenliang died of a 
severe case of COVID–19; 
Whereas the COVID–19 outbreak has disproportionately 
harmed China’s persecuted Uyghur Muslim minority as a 
result of the following actions taken by the Chinese Gov-
ernment— 
(1) the detention of over 1,000,000 Uyghur Muslims 
and other ethnic minorities in ‘‘re-education camps’’, 
whose crowded and unsanitary conditions makes the 
camps hotspots for viral disease and leave prisoners at an 
elevated risk of contracting COVID–19; 
(2) as reported by Uyghur Human Rights Project, 
and corroborated by video evidence and Radio Free Asia, 
an unannounced and strictly enforced quarantine of mil-
lions of residents in its predominantly Uyghur Muslim 
Xinjiang Province around January 24, 2020, resulted in 
mass starvation and shortages of basic medical supplies; 
and 
(3) on February 25, 2020, Xinhua News Service re-
ported that China had ‘‘re-located’’ 30,000 Uyghur labor-
ers to temporarily shuttered factories in the Hotan pre-

ernment deemed unacceptable for the ethnically Han ma-
jority; 
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control, being the premier 
infectious disease research institution in the world, was 
well situated at the beginning of the COVID–19 outbreak 
to both assist China’s response and prepare the United 
States to handle the virus should it spread internation-
ally; 
Whereas China’s National Health Commission failed to in-
clude individuals who tested positive for COVID–19 but 
remained asymptomatic in its daily tally of confirmed 
COVID–19 cases, hampering American public health au-
thorities’ ability to accurately account for the health risks 
of infection and spread rate of the virus; 
Whereas Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman, Zhao Lijian, 
claimed that COVID–19 originated in the United States 
and that the United States Army brought the virus to 
Wuhan to wage biological warfare on China; 
Whereas other Chinese Government officials including sci-
entists working on China’s COVID–19 response, China’s 
Ambassador to South Africa and China’s Ambassador to 
Australia have claimed that there is no evidence that 
COVID–19 originated in China; 
Whereas, on March 4, 2020, Xinhua News Agency, an official 
mouthpiece of the Chinese Government, published an ar-
ticle threatening to cut off medical supply exports to the 
United States and ‘‘plunge [the United States] into the 
mighty sea of coronavirus’’; 
Whereas, on March 17, 2020, China expelled American na-

and 
Whereas a study by the University of Southampton found 
that if China had taken action 3 weeks earlier, the spread 
of coronavirus would be reduced by 95 percent globally:
