(2) Eight to 10 hours of sleep a day is rec-
1
ommended for teenagers aged 13 to 18 years, but 
2
early school start times are contributing to lack of 
3
sleep among adolescents. 
4
(3) Despite the shift in biological rhythms dur-
5
ing puberty, which causes adolescents to sleep later 
6
at night and wake later in the morning, 93 percent 
7
of high schools and 83 percent of middle schools in 
8
the United States started before 8:30 a.m. in 2014. 
9
(4) Numerous local educational agencies across 
10
46 States have recently changed or are considering 
11
changing school start times in an effort to improve 
12
adolescent health, well-being, and performance. 
13
(5) Later school start times are associated 
14
with— 
15
(A) improvements in academic perform-
16
ance, including attendance rates, grade point 
17
averages, and test scores; 
18
(B) improvements in mental and physical 
19
health, including reduced risk of depression and 
20
obesity; and 
21
(C) improvements in public safety, includ-
22
ing reduced risk of automobile accidents. 
23
(6) A universal delay in school start times 
24
would be a cost-effective policy measure.
