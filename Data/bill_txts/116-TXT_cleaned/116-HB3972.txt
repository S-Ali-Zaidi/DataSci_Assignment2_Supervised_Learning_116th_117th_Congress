A BILL 
To amend chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, to provide 
that major rules of the executive branch shall have no 
force or effect unless a joint resolution of approval is 
enacted into law. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

SEC. 2. PURPOSE. 
1
The purpose of this Act is to increase accountability 
2
for and transparency in the Federal regulatory process. 
3
Section 1 of article I of the United States Constitution 
4
grants all legislative powers to Congress. Over time, Con-
5
gress has excessively delegated its constitutional charge 
6
while failing to conduct appropriate oversight and retain 
7
accountability for the content of the laws it passes. By 
8
requiring a vote in Congress, the REINS Act will result 
9
in more carefully drafted and detailed legislation, an im-
10
proved regulatory process, and a legislative branch that 
11
is truly accountable to the American people for the laws 
12
imposed upon them.
