(1) Early care and learning settings directly im-
1

2
ment of young children, and these settings should be 
3
designed and equipped to keep children safe and 
4
help children thrive. 
5
(2) An investigation in 10 States conducted by 
6
the Office of the Inspector General of the Depart-
7
ment of Health and Human Services found that 96 
8
percent of early care and learning facilities inspected 
9
during unannounced visits had at least 1 potentially 
10
hazardous condition. 
11
(3) Approximately 500,000 early care and 
12
learning facilities are not regulated under the Safe 
13
Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300f), and only 11 
14
States and New York City require licensed early 
15
care and learning facilities to test drinking water 
16
within such facilities for lead. 
17
(4) A Department of Health and Human Serv-
18
ices report from 2015 found that an estimated 2,201 
19
Head Start centers needed facility improvements, in-
20
cluding improvements related to rebuilding, ren-
21
ovating, and conducting maintenance on such facili-
22

(A) A 2011 statewide study of Massachu-

2
cessive levels of carbon dioxide in early care and 
3
learning facilities throughout the State, insuffi-
4
cient ventilation systems, and furnishings con-
5
taining formaldehyde. 
6
(B) A 2014 statewide study in Rhode Is-
7
land found that— 
8
(i) all centers visited had at least one 
9
playground safety hazard; 
10
(ii) centers in poor condition tend to 
11
serve higher rates of low-income, State- 
12
subsidized children; and 
13
(iii) nearly 70 percent of early learn-
14
ing centers visited had one or more issues 
15
related to the overall building condition, 
16
such as water stains, excessive wear, and 
17
peeling paint.

(6) The National Children’s Facilities Network 
19
estimates that the United States would require at 
20
least $17 billion to bring existing early care and 
21
learning facilities up to best-practice standards. 
22
(7) While data on the condition of facilities is 
23
available for 2 States, it is lacking elsewhere. The 
24
extent of the problem is impossible to determine

19
tion from employers claiming the credit under section 45F 
20
