RESOLUTION 
Supporting the goals and ideals of ‘‘National Nonviolence 
Week’’ to raise awareness of youth violence in the United 
States. 
Whereas teaching youth the practice of nonviolence may en-
courage a more peaceful society and promote principles 
of mutual respect, unity, dignity, and equality; 
Whereas the practice of nonviolence has been instrumental in 
promoting unity, safety, and equal rights in various 
movements across the globe; 
Whereas the impact of the civil rights movement, particularly 
in the Southern United States, continues to serve as an 
example of the power of nonviolence philosophy and how

Whereas the Sojourn to the Past program annually takes 
high school students to the historic locations of the civil 
rights movement, teaching them how the practice of non-
violence influenced the civil rights movement by miti-
gating discrimination, violence, hatred, bigotry, and in-
equity in schools and communities across America; 
Whereas students visit historic sites in Atlanta, including the 
Martin Luther King National Historical Park, where stu-
dents are able to learn about the life of Dr. King and his 
impact on American history; 
Whereas Atlanta served as an epicenter during the civil rights 
movement, and other Southern cities such as Selma, Bir-
mingham, Jackson, Montgomery, and Nashville also have 
historic monuments and sites relevant to the civil rights 
movement; 
Whereas the goal of the Sojourn to the Past program is to 
inspire students to become civic leaders with a duty and 
ability to unite people in their communities in equality 
and justice through knowledge, understanding, and com-
passion; 
Whereas the Sojourn to the Past program has afforded par-
ticipating students with a life-changing experience and 
serves as a catalyst for them becoming activists and ap-
plying nonviolence principles throughout their lives and 
professions; 
Whereas the Youngstown Sojourn to the Past students suc-
cessfully petitioned the Youngstown School Board, the 
Youngstown City Council, and the Youngstown State 
University trustees to declare the first week in October 
each year to be Nonviolence Week;

Whereas the Sojourn to the Past program has afforded par-
ticipating students with a life-changing experience by al-
lowing them to visit the American South and serves as 
a catalyst for them to become activists and apply non-
violence principles throughout their lives and professions; 
Whereas youth violence is becoming increasingly common in 
American society, the practice of nonviolence may serve 
as a tool to dismantle egregious acts such as school 
shootings and other forms of mass shootings, bullying, 
and the continued violence plaguing American commu-
nities; 
Whereas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (in this resolution referred to as the ‘‘CDC’’), 
youth violence is common, and nearly one in five high 
school students reported being bullied on school property 
in the last year; 
Whereas, according to the CDC, youth violence results in 
considerable physical, emotional, and economic con-
sequences; 
Whereas, according to the CDC’s nationwide Youth Risk Be-
havior Survey, about 6 percent of students had been 
threatened or injured with a weapon on school property 
one or more times during the 12 months before the sur-
vey; 
Whereas youth violence can significantly inhibit a child’s ac-
cess to education and their ability to feel safe, secure, 
and confident in an academic environment; 
Whereas sexual violence on college campuses is a pervasive 
issue plaguing the American education system and im-
pacts both men and women;

Whereas hostility toward homosexuality and gender noncon-
formity continues to plague gay, lesbian, bisexual, and 
transgender youth and adults in the United States; 
Whereas gun violence is an issue that continues to impact all 
Americans, with one-third of gun deaths being homicides 
and hundreds of mass shootings occurring annually; 
Whereas thousands of Americans have died as a result of gun 
violence and families have been impacted by egregious 
acts of gun violence and youth have been particularly vul-
nerable to its impact in their schools; 
Whereas the practice of nonviolence is one that may be bene-
ficial to people of all age groups, and beneficial to Amer-
ican society overall in combating increased violence and 
loss of life in our society; and 
Whereas the principle of nonviolence has been a core philos-
ophy of many successful social change movements: Now, 
therefore, be it
