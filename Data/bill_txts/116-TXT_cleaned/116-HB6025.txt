A BILL 
To improve the health and academic achievement of students 
in highly polluted environments, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Clean Air Sharp Minds 
4
Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. PURPOSES. 
6
The purposes of this Act are— 
7
(1) to improve the health and academic achieve-
8
ment of students in highly polluted environments;

(2) to demonstrate the impacts of clean air at 
1
school on student learning and well-being; and 
2
(3) to support the Nation’s schools to advance 
3
environmental justice. 
4
SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
5
Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) Substantial research demonstrates that air 
7
pollution negatively impacts health and cognition. 
8
(2) More than 1 in 5 public schools in the 
9
United States are located within a mile of a toxic re-
10
lease site. Nearly 1 in 11 public schools, serving 
11
4,400,000 students, are less than 500 feet from a 
12
major road. 
13
(3) According to a 2017 report, 4 percent of 
14
schools serving predominantly White students are 
15
next to major roads, while 15 percent of schools 
16
serving largely students of color are next to major 
17
roads. 
18
(4) Indoor levels of air pollutants can be 2 to 
19
5 times higher, and sometimes 100 times higher, 
20
than outdoor levels. In 2014, nearly half of schools 
21
in the United States reported having problems re-
22
lated to indoor air quality. 
23

•HR 6025 IH
(5) Schools in poor repair may have additional 
1
air quality problems, including lead, asbestos, dust, 
2
and radon contamination. 
3
(6) Poor indoor air quality increases the risk of 
4
severe asthma attacks and allergic reactions. Asthma 
5
is the leading cause of missed school days in the 
6
United States. 
7
(7) High-performance air filters can decrease 
8
indoor particulate matter by 90 percent. 
9
(8) Research demonstrates the potential for 
10
school air filters to improve student learning. In 
11
2016, commercial air filters were installed in every 
12
classroom, office, and common area of 18 public 
13
schools in Los Angeles. Controlling for student de-
14
mographics, mathematics test scores at these schools 
15
improved dramatically, nearly matching the impact 
16
of reducing class sizes by a third, and gains per-
17
sisted the following the year.
