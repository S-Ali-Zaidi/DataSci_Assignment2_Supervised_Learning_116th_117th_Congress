for Federal antidiscrimination claims. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Fair Employment Pro-

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:

•HR 4015 IH
(1) In fiscal year 2018, sex discrimination 
1
charges comprised 32.3 percent of the charges filed 
2
with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commis-
3
sion (referred to in this section as the ‘‘EEOC’’) 
4
under all the statutes the agency enforces. In fiscal 
5
year 2018, 84.1 percent of sexual harassment 
6
charges were filed by women. 
7
(2) Women and people of color working in low- 
8
wage jobs are particularly vulnerable to harassment 
9
in the workplace. 
10
(3) In some industries, harassment is even 
11
more widespread. For example, a survey conducted 
12
by the Restaurant Opportunities Centers United 
13
Forward Together found that two-thirds of women 
14
workers and over half of men workers had experi-
15
enced some form of sexual harassment from man-
16
agement in the restaurant industry; nearly 80 per-
17
cent of women and 70 percent of men experienced 
18
some form of sexual harassment from co-workers; 
19
and nearly 80 percent of women and 55 percent of 
20
men experienced some form of sexual harassment 
21
from customers. 
22
(4) Studies indicate that sexual harassment of 
23
women, including unwanted touching, grabbing, and 
24
stalking, is also common in male-dominated indus-
25

•HR 4015 IH
tries, such as construction, public safety, manufac-
1
turing, farming, and the high-tech industry. Harass-
2
ment in male-dominated industries operates as a 
3
barrier to women’s entry into higher paying jobs. 
4
(5) Racial harassment remains a pervasive 
5
problem in the workplace in the United States. In 
6
fiscal year 2018, 32.2 percent of the charges of al-
7
leged violations filed with the EEOC were charges 
8
on the basis of race. 
9
(6) Research shows that workers in a wide 
10
spectrum of occupations, ranging from service and 
11
support positions to management and professional 
12
positions, report experiencing race-based harassment 
13
while on the job. 
14
(7) Harassment in the workplace is a persistent 
15
barrier to opportunity for people with disabilities. 
16
Harassment can result in workers with disabilities 
17
being forced off the job. Workplace harassment is 
18
used to send the message that workers with disabil-
19
ities do not belong at work. 
20
(8) Age discrimination continues to be a barrier 
21
to employment for older workers. Nearly one-third of 
22
older workers report that they or someone they know 
23
experienced age discrimination in the workplace.

(9) The Supreme Court’s decision in Vance v. 
1
Ball State University, No. 11–556 (June 24, 2013), 
2
significantly undermines protections against dis-
3
crimination that the Supreme Court established in 
4
Faragher v. Boca Raton, 524 U.S. 775 (1998) and 
5
Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, 524 U.S. 742 
6
(1998), which held that an employer may be vicari-
7
ously liable under title VII of the Civil Rights Act 
8
of 1964 for harassment of an employee by an indi-
9
vidual that has supervisory authority over that em-
10
ployee. 
11
(10) In Faragher and Ellerth, the Supreme 
12
Court held that employers will be subject to a strict 
13
liability standard when employees with supervisory 
14
authority engage in harassment that results in ‘‘tan-
15
gible employment actions’’. However, in situations 
16
where ‘‘supervisors’’ engage in harassment that does 
17
not result in tangible employment actions, the Court 
18
explained, an employer can avoid vicarious liability 
19
by showing that— 
20
(A) the employer exercised reasonable care 
21
to prevent and correct any harassing behavior; 
22
and 
23
02:04 Aug 03, 2019
H4015

•HR 4015 IH
(B) the plaintiff unreasonably failed to 
1
take advantage of the preventive or corrective 
2
opportunities that the employer provided. 
3
(11) Whether an employer should be vicariously 
4
liable for harassment is a functional analysis that is 
5
based not on the title of the harasser or the employ-
6
er’s job description for the harasser’s position but on 
7
the authority vested in that individual by the em-
8
ployer. 
9
(12) The Supreme Court holding in Vance lim-
10
its the category of individuals who are considered su-
11
pervisors and for which an employer may be held vi-
12
cariously liable under Faragher and Ellerth to those 
13
individuals that have authority to take tangible em-
14
ployment actions. This holding ignores the reality 
15
that employees with the authority to control their 
16
subordinates’ daily work should be included in that 
17
category, for which an employer may be held vicari-
18
ously liable, because such individuals are aided by 
19
that authority in perpetuating a discriminatory work 
20
environment. 
21
(13) Individuals who direct the daily work ac-
22
tivities of employees but do not have the authority 
23
to take tangible employment actions against those 
24
employees are common in the workplace in the 
25

•HR 4015 IH
United States, particularly in industries that employ 
1
low-wage workers. Workers in industries including 
2
retail, restaurant, health care, housekeeping, and 
3
personal care, which may pay low wages and employ 
4
large numbers of female workers, are particularly 
5
vulnerable to harassment by individuals who have 
6
the power to direct day-to-day work activities but 
7
lack the power to take tangible employment actions. 
8
(b) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act is to clarify 
9
that an employer’s vicarious liability for harassment under 
10
title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Age Discrimi-
11
nation in Employment Act of 1967, the Americans with 
12
Disabilities Act of 1990, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 
13
section 1977 of the Revised Statutes, the Genetic Informa-
14
tion Nondiscrimination Act of 2008, the Government Em-
15
ployee Rights Act of 1991, the Congressional Account-
16
ability Act of 1995, and title 3, United States Code, ex-
17
tends to— 
18
(1) an individual with the authority to under-
19
take or recommend tangible employment actions af-
20
fecting the victim of the harassment; or 
21
(2) an individual with the authority to direct 
22
the victim’s daily work activities.
