Congress makes the following findings:

•HR 2529 IH
(1) Since the end of World War II, the United 
1
States has relied on a robust and effective nuclear 
2
deterrent as part of its national defense, particularly 
3
against the Soviet Union and its successor state, the 
4
Russian Federation. 
5
(2) The United States nuclear arsenal must re-
6
main, safe, secure, and reliable such that it can ef-
7
fectively ensure the security of the United States 
8
and its allies. 
9
(3) Along with its nuclear deterrent, the United 
10
States has pursued a number of arms control, disar-
11
mament, and nonproliferation agreements with the 
12
Soviet Union and Russia to ensure strategic stability 
13
and the protection of the United States homeland, 
14
such as— 
15
(A) the Interim Agreement Between the 
16
United States of America and the Union of So-
17
viet Socialist Republics on Certain Measures 
18
with Respect to the Limitation of Strategic Of-
19
fensive Arms, signed on May 26, 1972 (com-
20
monly referred to as SALT I); and 
21
(B) the Treaty Between the United States 
22
of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist 
23
Republics on Strategic Offensive Reductions, 
24
00:31 May 14, 2019
H2529

•HR 2529 IH
signed on July 31, 1991 (commonly referred to 
1
as START I). 
2
(4) In the aftermath of the fall of the Soviet 
3
Union, the United States continues to rely on a com-
4
bination of nuclear deterrence and strategic arms 
5
control to help protect the United States from nu-
6
clear attack. 
7
(5) On April 8, 2010, the United States and 
8
the Russia signed the Treaty between the United 
9
States of America and the Russian Federation on 
10
Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation 
11
of Strategic Offensive Arms (commonly referred to 
12
as ‘‘New Start Treaty’’). 
13
(6) In an op-ed to the Washington Post dated 
14
December 2, 2010, former Secretaries of State 
15
Henry A. Kissinger, George P. Shultz, James A. 
16
Baker III, Lawrence S. Eagleburger, and Colin L. 
17
Powell urged the Senate to ratify the Treaty, stating 
18
that it was in ‘‘the national interest to ratify’’. 
19
(7) During the ratification process, the Treaty 
20
garnered bipartisan support, and the United States 
21
Senate approved the Treaty on December 22, 2010, 
22
by a 71–26 vote. 
23
(8) The Treaty entered into force on February 
24
5, 2011, placing numerical limits on United States 
25

and Russian strategic systems, including interconti-
1
nental ballistic missiles, submarine launched ballistic 
2
missiles, and heavy bombers, as well as warheads. 
3
(9) On February 5, 2018, the Treaty’s central 
4
limits on strategic arms took effect. 
5
(10) Through the Treaty’s verification regime, 
6
which includes short-notice, on-site inspections at 
7
military bases and facilities, the United States is 
8
able to verify the data provided by Russia regarding 
9
its strategic nuclear arsenal. The verification regime 
10
provides both countries insight into each other’s 
11
strategic nuclear delivery systems, warheads, and fa-
12
cilities, as well as data exchanges to track the status 
13
and makeup of nuclear weapons systems. 
14
(11) During a February 26, 2019, hearing on 
15
nuclear deterrence requirements of the Senate 
16
Armed Services Committee, Commander of the 
17
United States Strategic Command (STRATCOM) 
18
General John Hyten voiced his support for the Trea-
19
ty, saying he was ‘‘a big supporter of the New 
20
START agreement’’ and stating, ‘‘The New START 
21
treaty’’ provides ‘‘insights into the Russians capa-
22
bilities. Those are hugely beneficial to me.’’. 
23
(12) During a March 2017 hearing on nuclear 
24
deterrence requirements of the House Armed Serv-
25

•HR 2529 IH
ices Committee, Air Force General Paul Selva, the 
1
Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, also en-
2
dorsed the New START Treaty, saying the Treaty 
3
is ‘‘a bilateral, verifiable agreement that gives us 
4
some degree of predictability on what our potential 
5
adversaries look like’’. 
6
(13) Lieutenant General Jack Weinstein, the 
7
Air Force Deputy Chief of Staff for Strategic Deter-
8
rence and Nuclear Integration, asserted that the 
9
New START Treaty was of ‘‘huge value’’ to United 
10
States security. 
11
(14) During a September 2018 hearing before 
12
the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Deputy 
13
Secretary of Defense for Policy David Trachtenberg 
14
stated that ‘‘the transparency and verification re-
15
quirements of the New START Treaty are a ben-
16
efit’’ to the security of the United States and, in re-
17
sponse to a question regarding missile defense, as-
18
serted that the Treaty had ‘‘no’’ effect on limiting 
19
United States missile defense capabilities. 
20
(15) In a March 2017 hearing of the Strategic 
21
Forces Subcommittee of the House Armed Services 
22
Committee, Retired Air Force General and former 
23
commander of United States Strategic Command 
24
Robert Kehler stated, ‘‘I think that we have gotten 
25
00:31 May 14, 2019

•HR 2529 IH
tremendous benefit out of those kinds of agreements 
1
with the Russians over the years, provided that the 
2
Russians comply,’’ regarding the importance of the 
3
New START Treaty. 
4
(16) The Department of State confirmed in 
5
February 2018 that Russia had met the Treaty’s 
6
central limits on strategic arms and stated that ‘‘im-
7
plementation of the New START Treaty enhances 
8
the safety and security of the United States’’. 
9
(17) The Nuclear Posture Review states that 
10
arms control agreements can ‘‘foster transparency, 
11
understanding, and predictability in adversary rela-
12
tions, thereby reducing the risk of misunderstanding 
13
and miscalculation’’. 
14
(18) The New START Treaty strengthens 
15
United States nuclear security and strategic stability 
16
by reducing the number of strategic systems in Rus-
17
sia’s nuclear arsenal and provides the United States 
18
with the inspection and monitoring tools necessary 
19
to confidently verify Russian compliance with the 
20
Treaty. 
21
(19) The New START Treaty does not restrict 
22
United States nuclear modernization programs or 
23
limit United States missile defense efforts.

•HR 2529 IH
(20) If the New START Treaty is not extended 
1
or replaced before it expires in 2021, the United 
2
States runs the risk of having no legally binding, 
3
verifiable limits on Russia’s strategic nuclear arsenal 
4
for the first time since 1972. 
5
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
6
It is the sense of Congress that the United States 
7
should seek to extend the New START Treaty from its 
8
initial termination date in February 2021 to February 
9
2026, as provided for under Article XIV of the Treaty, 
10
unless the President determines and informs the appro-
11
priate congressional committees that— 
12
(1) Russia is in material breach of the Treaty; 
13
or 
14
(2) the United States and Russia have entered 
15
into a new arms control agreement to replace the 
16
Treaty that provides equal or greater constraints, 
17
transparency, and verification measures with regard 
18
to Russia’s nuclear forces.
