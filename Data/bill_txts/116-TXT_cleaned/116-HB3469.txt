PROVEMENT. 
2
(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 180 days after the 
3
date of the enactment of this Act and annually thereafter, 
4
the Administrator of the Transportation Security Admin-
5
istration shall implement the following: 
6
(1) A system for conducting risk-informed 
7
headquarters-based covert tests of aviation security 
8
operations, including relating to airport passenger 
9
and baggage security screening operations, that can 
10
yield statistically valid data that can be used to iden-
11
tify 
and 
assess 
the 
nature 
and 
extent 
of 
12
vulnerabilities to such operations that are not miti-
13
gated by current security practices. The Adminis-
14
trator shall execute annually not fewer than three 
15
risk-informed covert testing projects designed to 
16
identify systemic vulnerabilities in the transportation 
17
security system, and shall document the assumptions 
18
and rationale guiding the selection of such projects. 
19
(2) A long-term headquarters-based covert test-
20
ing program, employing static but risk-informed 
21
threat vectors, designed to assess changes in overall 
22
screening effectiveness. 
23
(b) MITIGATION.— 
24
(1) IN
GENERAL.—The Administrator of the 
25
Transportation Security Administration shall estab-
26

•HR 3469 IH
lish a system to address and mitigate the 
1
vulnerabilities identified and assessed pursuant to 
2
the testing conducted under subsection (a). 
3
(2) ANALYSIS.—Not later than 60 days after 
4
the identification of any such vulnerability, the Ad-
5
ministrator shall ensure a vulnerability described in 
6
paragraph (1) is analyzed to determine root causes. 
7
(3) DETERMINATION.—Not later than 120 days 
8
after the identification of any such vulnerability, the 
9
Administrator shall make a determination regarding 
10
whether or not to mitigate such vulnerability. The 
11
Administrator 
shall 
prioritize 
mitigating 
12
vulnerabilities based on their ability to reduce risk. 
13
If the Administrator determines— 
14
(A) to not mitigate such vulnerability, the 
15
Administrator shall document the reasons for 
16
the decision; or 
17
(B) to mitigate such vulnerability, the Ad-
18
ministrator shall establish and document— 
19
(i) key milestones appropriate for the 
20
level of effort required to so mitigate such 
21
vulnerability; and 
22
(ii) a date by which measures to so 
23
mitigate such vulnerability shall be imple-

(4) RETESTING.—Not later than 180 days after 
3
the date on which measures to mitigate a vulner-
4
ability are completed by the Transportation Security 
5
Administration pursuant to paragraph (3)(B)(ii), the 
6
Administrator shall conduct a covert test in accord-
7
ance with subsection (a) of the aviation security op-
8
eration with respect to which such vulnerability was 
9
identified to assess the effectiveness of such meas-
10
ures to mitigate such vulnerability. 
11
(c) COMPILATION OF LISTS.— 
12
(1) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 60 days after 
13
completing a covert testing protocol under sub-
14
section (a), the Administrator of the Transportation 
15
Security Administration shall compile a list (includ-
16
ing a classified annex if necessary) of the 
17
vulnerabilities identified and assessed pursuant to 
18
such testing. Each such list shall contain, at a min-
19
imum, the following: 
20
(A) A brief description of the nature of 
21
each vulnerability so identified and assessed. 
22
(B) The date on which each vulnerability 
23
was so identified and assessed.

(C) Key milestones appropriate for the

level of effort required to mitigate each vulner-
2
ability, as well as an indication of whether each 
3
such milestone has been met. 
4
(D) An indication of whether each vulner-
5
ability has been mitigated or reduced and, if so, 
6
the date on which each such vulnerability was 
7
so mitigated or reduced. 
8
(E) If a vulnerability has not been fully 
9
mitigated, the date by which the Administrator 
10
shall so mitigate such vulnerability or a deter-
11
mination that it is not possible to fully mitigate 
12
such vulnerability. 
13
(F) The results of any subsequent covert 
14
testing undertaken to assess whether mitigation 
15
efforts have eliminated or reduced each vulner-
16
ability.

(2) SUBMISSION TO CONGRESS.—The Adminis-
18
