SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Ending Homelessness 
2
Act of 2019’’.

SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS. 
4
The Congress finds that— 
5
(1) although the United States has experienced 
6
a reduction in veteran homelessness after a surge of 
7
new Federal funding targeted to homeless veterans 
8
starting in fiscal year 2008, major progress towards 
9
the national goals for ending homelessness in our 
10
Nation has virtually stalled in the absence of in-
11
creased funding; 
12
(2) according to the Department of Housing 
13
and Urban Development’s 2018 point-in-time count, 
14
there were 552,830 people experiencing homeless-
15
ness in the United States on any given night, includ-
16
ing nearly 160,000 children and youth; 
17
(3) homelessness in many communities has 
18
reached crisis proportions and some cities have de-
19
clared that homelessness has reached a state of 
20
emergency; and 
21
(4) the Federal Government must renew its 
22
commitment to the national goals to end homeless-
23
ness.
