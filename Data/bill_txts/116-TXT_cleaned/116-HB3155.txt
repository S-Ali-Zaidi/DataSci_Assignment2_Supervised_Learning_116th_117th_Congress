•HR 3155 IH
(1) the United States entered World War II as 
1
a result of the surprise Japanese attack against our 
2
fleet at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on December 7, 
3
1941, which killed 2,403 people of the United 
4
States; 
5
(2) the United States joined the wartime Allied 
6
cause against the militarist, fascist, and racist dicta-
7
torships of Germany, Japan, and Italy (the Axis), 
8
fighting for President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s ‘‘Four 
9
Freedoms’’ (freedom of speech, of worship, from 
10
want, and from fear); 
11
(3) the United States placed no more than 
12
16,000,000 of its citizens into uniform in the course 
13
of the struggle, enduring a string of early defeats, 
14
recovering to conduct a total war on land, sea, and 
15
air, and eventually establishing total dominance over 
16
its enemies; 
17
(4) the war took the lives of 405,399 United 
18
States military personnel, fellow citizens who made 
19
the supreme sacrifice in a perilous moment in the 
20
history of the United States, giving their lives for 
21
the cause of democracy and peace; 
22
(5) the conflict led to a comprehensive trans-
23
formation of the home front from a civilian economy 
24
dedicated to peacetime production into the mightiest

engine of military might in human history (labeled 
1
the ‘‘Arsenal of Democracy’’), demanding the par-
2
ticipation of the entire citizenry and thus leading to 
3
increased opportunities for racial minorities and 
4
women; 
5
(6) the war ended on September 2, 1945, after 
6
the unconditional surrender of Nazi Germany, Fas-
7
cist Italy, and Imperial Japan, and a total victory 
8
for the United States and the Allies; 
9
(7) Allied victory in World War II transformed 
10
the United States into the leader of the ‘‘free 
11
world,’’ a community of countries dedicated to demo-
12
cratic principles and to resisting all forms of tyr-
13
anny, including authoritarian, militarist, or com-
14
munist, and an international order founded on open 
15
societies, liberal economies, and the peaceful resolu-
16
tion of disputes; 
17
(8) participation in the wartime struggle 
18
emboldened women, African Americans and other 
19
previously marginalized groups to seek equal rights, 
20
encouraged the growth of the civil rights movement, 
21
and thus contributed to the development of ‘‘a more 
22
perfect union,’’ guaranteeing freedom, justice, and 
23
equality for all;

•HR 3155 IH
(9) the generation of United States citizens who 
1
fought World War II is passing away with the 
2
march of time, and that therefore the urgent need 
3
to give honor to those who served is all the more 
4
critical; and 
5
(10) the period from May 8, 2020, to Sep-
6
tember 2, 2020, will mark the 75th anniversary of 
7
the end of the involvement of the United States in 
8
World War II and the surrender of Nazi Germany 
9
and Imperial Japan, respectively.
