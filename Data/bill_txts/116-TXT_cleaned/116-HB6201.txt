SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE. 
11
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘COVID-19 Health 
12
Care Worker Protection Act of 2020’’. 
13
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
14
Congress finds the following: 
15
(1) The infectious disease COVID–19 presents 
16
a grave danger to health care workers who are the 
17
first line of defense of the United States against this 
18
epidemic. 
19
(2) Hundreds of health care workers in the 
20
United States have been infected or quarantined due 
21
to exposure to patients with COVID–19. Surveys 
22
conducted by health care worker unions and others 
23
have found that many health care facilities are inad-
24

H6201
20 
•HR 6201 IH
equately prepared to safely protect health care work-
1
ers who are exposed to the virus. 
2
(3) Inadequate infection control precautions 
3
have a detrimental impact on health care workers, 
4
patients and the public, and if there is breakdown in 
5
health care worker protections, the nation’s public 
6
health system is placed at risk. 
7
(4) The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 
8
(hereinafter referred to as ‘‘SARS’’) epidemic of 
9
2003 and 2004 in Canada, which involved a 
10
coronavirus, resulted in a disproportionately large 
11
number of infections of both health care workers and 
12
patients in Ontario, Canada, hospitals due to insuffi-
13
cient infection control procedures involving SARS. 
14
(5) The Occupational Safety and Health Ad-
15
ministration began rulemaking on a standard to pro-
16
tect health care workers from airborne and other in-
17
fectious diseases in 2009. In 2017, the Trump Ad-
18
ministration suspended work on this rulemaking, re-
19
moving it from the active Regulatory Agenda. 
20
(6) The Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
21
vention issued a document entitled, ‘‘2007 Guideline 
22
for Isolation Precautions: Preventing Transmission 
23
of Infectious Agents in Healthcare Settings’’ in July, 
24
00:50 Mar 12, 2020
H6201
21 
•HR 6201 IH
2007. However, the guideline in such document is 
1
not binding. 
2
(7) Absent an enforceable standard, employers 
3
lack mandatory requirements to implement an effec-
4
tive and ongoing infection and exposure control pro-
5
gram that provides protection to health care workers 
6
from COVID–19. 
7
(8) Section 6(c)(1) of the Occupational Safety 
8
and Health Act authorizes the Occupational Safety 
9
and Health Administration to issue an ‘‘Emergency 
10
Temporary Standard’’ if employees are exposed to 
11
grave danger from harmful agents or new hazards 
12
and if an emergency standard is necessary to protect 
13
employees from such danger. The widespread out-
14
break of COVID–19 clearly satisfies these two condi-
15
tions. 
16
(9) The Occupational Safety and Health Ad-
17
ministration has received two petitions in March 
18
2020 calling on the Occupational Safety and Health 
19
Administration to issue an Emergency Temporary 
20
Standard to protect workers from COVID–19. 
21
(10) An Emergency Temporary Standard is 
22
necessary to ensure the immediate protection of 
23
workers in health care workplaces and other high- 
24
risk workplaces identified by the Centers for Disease
