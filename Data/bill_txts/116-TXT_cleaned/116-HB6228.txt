(ii) at the headwaters of the streams 
20
and rivers on land with respect to which 
21

23

(II) opportunities for diversion, 
1
storage, or other uses of water occur-
2
ring outside the land that would ad-
3
versely affect the wilderness values of 
4
the land; 
5
(B) the wilderness areas are generally not 
6
suitable for use or development of new water re-
7
source facilities; and 
8
(C) because of the unique nature of the 
9
wilderness areas, it is possible to provide for 
10
proper management and protection of the wil-
11
derness and other values of land in ways dif-
12
ferent from those used in other laws.
