adapted’’, with respect to plants, means plants that 
2
originate from an area that is geographically proxi-

4
mentally adapted to, and likely to succeed in becom-
5
ing established and persisting within, such area. 
6
(3) NATIVE PLANT SPECIES.—The term ‘‘native 
7
plant species’’ means indigenous terrestrial and 
8
aquatic plant species that evolved naturally in a de-
9
fined native ecosystem.

(4) NONNATIVE
PLANT
SPECIES.—The term 
11
‘‘nonnative plant species’’ means a plant that has 
12
been introduced by humans to a location outside its
