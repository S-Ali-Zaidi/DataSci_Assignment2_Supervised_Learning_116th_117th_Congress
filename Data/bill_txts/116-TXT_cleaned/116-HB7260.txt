A BILL 
To reduce and eliminate threats posed by nuclear weapons 
to the United States, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Hastening Arms Limi-
4
tations Talks Act of 2020’’ or the ‘‘HALT Act of 2020’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress makes the following findings:

•HR 7260 IH
(1) The use of nuclear weapons poses an exis-
1
tential threat to humanity, a fact that led President 
2
Ronald Reagan and Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorba-
3
chev to declare in a joint statement in 1987 that a 
4
‘‘nuclear war cannot be won and must never be 
5
fought’’. 
6
(2) On June 12, 1982, an estimated 1,000,000 
7
people attended the largest peace rally in United 
8
States history, in support of a movement to freeze 
9
and reverse the nuclear arms race, a movement that 
10
helped to create the political will necessary for the 
11
negotiation of several bilateral arms control treaties 
12
between the United States and former Soviet Union, 
13
and then the Russian Federation. Those treaties 
14
contributed to strategic stability through mutual and 
15
verifiable reciprocal nuclear weapons reductions. 
16
(3) Since the advent of nuclear weapons in 
17
1945, millions of people around the world have stood 
18
up to demand meaningful, immediate international 
19
action to halt, reduce, and eliminate the threats 
20
posed by nuclear weapons, nuclear weapons testing, 
21
and nuclear war, to humankind and the planet. 
22
(4) In 1970, the Treaty on the Non-Prolifera-
23
tion of Nuclear Weapons done at Washington, Lon-
24
don, and Moscow July 1, 1968 (21 UST 483) (com-

monly referred to as the ‘‘Nuclear Non-Proliferation 
1
Treaty’’ or the ‘‘NPT’’), entered into force, which 
2
includes a binding obligation on the 5 nuclear-weap-
3
on states (commonly referred to as the ‘‘P5’’), 
4
among other things, ‘‘to pursue negotiations in good 
5
faith on effective measures relating to the cessation 
6
of the nuclear arms race . . . and to nuclear disar-
7
mament’’. 
8
(5) Bipartisan United States global leadership 
9
has curbed the growth in the number of countries 
10
possessing nuclear weapons and has slowed overall 
11
vertical proliferation among countries already pos-
12
sessing nuclear weapons, as is highlighted by a more 
13
than 85-percent reduction in the United States nu-
14
clear weapons stockpile from its Cold War height of 
15
31,255 in 1967. 
16
(6) The United States testing of nuclear weap-
17
ons is no longer necessary as a result of the fol-
18
lowing major technical developments since the Sen-
19
ate’s consideration of the Comprehensive Nuclear- 
20
Test-Ban Treaty (commonly referred to as the 
21
‘‘CTBT’’) in 1999:

nization 
(commonly 
referred 
to 
as 
the

‘‘CTBTO’’)— 
2
(i) has made significant advance-
3
ments, as seen through its network of 300 
4
International Monitoring Stations and its 
5
International Data Centre, which together 
6
provide for the near instantaneous detec-
7
tion of nuclear explosives tests, including 
8
all 6 such tests conducted by North Korea 
9
between 2006 and 2017; and 
10
(ii) is operational 24 hours a day, 7 
11
days a week. 
12
(B) Since the United States signed the 
13
CTBT, confidence has grown in the science- 
14
based Stockpile Stewardship and Management 
15
Plan of the Department of Energy, which forms 
16
the basis of annual certifications to the Presi-
17
dent regarding the continual safety, security, 
18
and effectiveness of the United States nuclear 
19
deterrent in the absence of nuclear testing, 
20
leading former Secretary of Energy Ernest 
21
Moniz to remark in 2015 that ‘‘lab directors 
22
today now state that they certainly understand 
23
much more about how nuclear weapons work 
24
than during the period of nuclear testing’’.

(7) Despite the progress made to reduce the 
1
number and role of, and risks posed by, nuclear 
2
weapons, and to halt the Cold War-era nuclear arms 
3
race, tensions between countries that possess nuclear 
4
weapons are on the rise, key nuclear risk reduction 
5
treaties are under threat, significant stockpiles of 
6
weapons-usable fissile material remain, and a quali-
7
tative global nuclear arms race is now underway 
8
with each of the countries that possess nuclear 
9
weapons spending tens of billions of dollars each 
10
year to maintain and improve their arsenals. 
11
(8) The United States and the Russian Federa-
12
tion are both pursuing the development of desta-
13
bilizing types of nuclear weapons, including new 
14
lower-yield nuclear weapons that are more usable, 
15
and the People’s Republic of China, India, Pakistan, 
16
and North Korea have each taken concerning steps 
17
to diversify their more modest, but nonetheless very 
18
deadly, nuclear arsenals. 
19
(9) Since January 2017, President Donald 
20
Trump has taken the following actions, which have 
21
run counter to the objectives of the Creating an En-
22
vironment for Nuclear Disarmament (commonly re-
23
ferred to as ‘‘CEND’’) initiative that his administra-
24
tion launched in 2018:

•HR 7260 IH
(A) The release of the 2018 Nuclear Pos-
1
ture Review on February 5, 2018, which low-
2
ered the threshold for nuclear weapons use and 
3
called for the development of the following new 
4
nuclear weapons: 
5
(i) A low-yield warhead on a sub-
6
marine-launched ballistic missile, which 
7
was deployed before the date of the enact-
8
ment of this Act. 
9
(ii) A sea-launched cruise missile, still 
10
under development on the date of the en-
11
actment of this Act. 
12
(B) The unilateral United States with-
13
drawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of 
14
Action (commonly referred to as the ‘‘JCPOA’’) 
15
announced on May 8, 2018, which may lead to 
16
the complete collapse of an agreement that had 
17
verifiably closed of each of Iran’s pathways to 
18
a nuclear weapon. 
19
(C) The unilateral United States with-
20
drawal, completed on August 2, 2019, from the

ington December 8, 1987, and entered into 
1
force June 1, 1988 (commonly referred to as 
2
the ‘‘Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Trea-
3
ty’’ or the ‘‘INF Treaty’’), in response to the 
4
material breach by the Russian Federation of 
5
its obligations under that Treaty, which has re-
6
moved all legal constraints on the testing, pro-
7
curement, and deployment of ground-based 
8
shorter-range and intermediate-range missiles, 
9
increasing the risk of a missile arms race in the 
10
Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific regions. 
11
(D) The unilateral United States with-
12
drawal, announced on May 22, 2020, from the 
13
Treaty on Open Skies, done at Helsinki March 
14
24, 1992, and entered into force January 1, 
15
2002 (commonly referred to as the ‘‘Open Skies 
16
Treaty’’), which is likely to deny to United 
17
States allies and partners a key confidence- 
18
building measure and one of the few remaining 
19
operational diplomatic forums, through the 
20
Open Skies Consultative Commission, to engage 
21
with the Russian Federation. 
22
(10) During a May 15, 2020, National Security 
23
Council meeting, one or more senior officials of the 
24
Trump administration reportedly advocated that the

•HR 7260 IH
United States conduct its first nuclear explosives 
1
test since 1992, as part of an effort to bring the 
2
Russian Federation and the People’s Republic of 
3
China into negotiations on a trilateral arms control 
4
agreement. 
5
(11) A move by the United States to break its 
6
moratorium on nuclear explosives testing would con-
7
flict with United Nations Security Council Resolu-
8
tion 2310, led by the United States and adopted in 
9
2016, which states that any nuclear explosives test 
10
would defeat the ‘‘object and purpose’’ of the CTBT 
11
and called on all countries to maintain their respec-
12
tive moratoriums on such tests. 
13
(12) In light of moves by the United States and 
14
other countries to increase their reliance on nuclear 
15
weapons, the 21st century nuclear freeze movement 
16
would seek to halt the new nuclear arms race by 
17
seeking conclusion of a comprehensive and verifiable 
18
freeze on the testing, deployment, and production of 
19
nuclear weapons and delivery vehicles for such weap-
20
ons. 
21
(13) The United States would benefit from con-
22
clusion of a comprehensive nuclear arms agreement 
23
with each of the nuclear-weapon state parties to the

NPT and potentially all countries that possess nu-

(14) In 2013, the report on a nuclear weapons 
3
employment strategy of the United States submitted 
4
under section 492 of title 10, United States Code, 
5
determined that it is possible to ensure the security 
6
of the United States and allies and partners of the 
7
United States and maintain a strong and credible 
8
strategic deterrent while safely pursuing up to a 1⁄3 
9
reduction in deployed nuclear weapons from the level 
10
established in the Treaty between the United States 
11
of America and the Russian Federation on Measures 
12
for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Stra-
13
tegic Offensive Arms, signed April 8, 2010, and en-
14
tered into force February 5, 2011 (commonly re-
15
ferred to as the ‘‘New START Treaty’’). 
16
SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
17
It is the policy of the United States that: 
18
(1) The United States should build upon its 
19
decades long, bipartisan efforts to reduce the num-
20
ber and salience of nuclear weapons by leading inter-
21
national negotiations on specific arms-reduction 
22
measures as part of a 21st century global nuclear 
23
freeze movement. 
24
21:22 Jul 12, 2020
H7260
10 
•HR 7260 IH
(2) The United States should immediately agree 
1
to extend the New START Treaty for 5 years, until 
2
February 5, 2026, through mutual agreement with 
3
the Russian Federation to provide continued insight 
4
into the location, movement, and disposition of stra-
5
tegic delivery vehicles and deployed warheads belong-
6
ing to the Russian Federation, which would be an 
7
important first step to building momentum for a 
8
multilateral arms control initiative. 
9
(3) Upon the successful extension of the New 
10
START Treaty, the United States should engage 
11
with all other countries that possess nuclear weapons 
12
to negotiate and conclude future multilateral arms 
13
control, disarmament, and risk reduction agree-
14
ments, which should contain some or all of the fol-
15
lowing provisions: 
16
(A) An agreement on a verifiable freeze on 
17
the testing, production, and further deployment 
18
of all nuclear weapons and delivery vehicles for 
19
such weapons. 
20
(B) An agreement that establishes a 
21
verifiable numerical ceiling on the deployed 
22
shorter-range and intermediate-range and stra-
23
tegic delivery systems (as defined by the INF 
24
Treaty and the New START Treaty, respec-

tively) and the nuclear warheads associated 
1
with such systems belonging to the P5, and to 
2
the extent possible, all countries that possess 
3
nuclear weapons, at August 2, 2019, levels. 
4
(C) An agreement by each country to 
5
adopt a policy of no first use of nuclear weap-
6
ons. 
7
(D) An agreement on a proactive United 
8
Nations Security Council resolution that ex-
9
pands access by the International Atomic En-
10
ergy Agency to any country found by the Board 
11
of Governors of that Agency to be noncompliant 
12
with its obligations under the NPT. 
13
(E) An agreement to refrain from config-
14
uring nuclear forces in a ‘‘launch on warning’’ 
15
nuclear posture allowing a country to launch a 
16
ballistic missile attack in response to detection 
17
by an early-warning satellite or sensor of a sus-
18
pected incoming ballistic missile. 
19
(F) An agreement not to target or inter-
20
fere in the nuclear command, control, and com-
21
munications (commonly referred to as ‘‘NC3’’) 
22
infrastructure of another country through a 
23
cyberattack. 
24
21:22 Jul 12, 2020
H7260
12 
•HR 7260 IH
(G) An agreement on transparency meas-
1
ures or verifiable limits, or both, on hypersonic 
2
cruise missiles and glide vehicles that are 
3
mounted on ballistic missiles. 
4
(H) An agreement to provide a baseline 
5
and continuous exchanges detailing the aggre-
6
gate number of active nuclear weapons and as-
7
sociated systems possessed by each country. 
8
(4) The United States should rejuvenate efforts 
9
in the United Nations Conference on Disarmament 
10
governing the consensus rule on negotiation of a 
11
verifiable Fissile Material Treaty or Fissile Material 
12
Cutoff Treaty, or move negotiations to another 
13
international body or fora, such as a meeting of the 
14
P5. Successful conclusion of such a treaty would 
15
verifiably prevent any country’s production of highly 
16
enriched uranium and plutonium for use in nuclear 
17
weapons. 
18
(5) The United States should convene a series 
19
of high level summits on nuclear disarmament mod-
20
eled on the Nuclear Security Summits process, 
21
which saw the elimination of the equivalent of 3,000 
22
nuclear weapons. 
23
(6) The President should seek ratification by 
24
the Senate of the CTBT and mobilize all countries 
25
21:22 Jul 12, 2020
H7260
13 
•HR 7260 IH
covered by Annex 2 of the CTBT to pursue similar 
1
action to hasten entry into force of the CTBT. The 
2
entry into force of the CTBT, for which ratification 
3
by the United States will provide critical momentum, 
4
will activate the CTBT’s onsite inspection provision 
5
to investigate allegations that any country that is a 
6
party to the CTBT has conducted a nuclear test of 
7
any yield. 
8
(7) The President should make the accession of 
9
North Korea to the CTBT a component of any final 
10
agreement in fulfilling the pledges the Government 
11
of North Korea made in Singapore, as North Korea 
12
is reportedly the only country to have conducted a 
13
nuclear explosive test since 1998. 
14
(8) The United States should— 
15
(A) refrain from developing any new de-
16
signs for nuclear warheads or bombs, but espe-
17
cially designs that could add a level of technical 
18
uncertainty into the United States stockpile and 
19
thus renew calls to resume nuclear explosive 
20
testing in order to test that new design; and 
21
(B) seek reciprocal commitments from 
22
other countries that possess nuclear weapons.
