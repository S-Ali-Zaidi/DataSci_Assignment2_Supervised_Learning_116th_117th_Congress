Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Pandemic Supplies 
4
Production Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) The global shortage of medical and sanita-
8
tion supplies due to the COVID–19 pandemic has 
9
paralyzed health care systems and strained emer-
10
gency response capabilities of governments around 
11
the world. 
12
(2) The pandemic demonstrated the inter-
13
dependent nature and the limitations of global sup-
14
ply chains as both our nation and the world com-
15
petes for a finite number of suppliers for critical 
16
medical and sanitation resources. 
17
(3) Providing a comprehensive understanding of 
18
how to procure, manage, deliver, and sustain at scale 
19
was necessary during this crisis, and will be critical 
20
as the U.S. replenishes current supplies and plans 
21
for future crises. 
22
(4) The Federal Emergency Management Agen-
23
cy and the Department of Health and Human Serv-
24
ices were challenged to rapidly identify, procure, and 
25

deploy large quantities of goods and services while 
1
simultaneously responding and planning for the re-
2
covery of the United States from this global pan-
3
demic. 
4
(5) The traditional interagency emergency re-
5
sponse structure, built to respond to natural disas-
6
ters typically defined by geographic locales, does not 
7
have the capacity to scale quickly to address a crisis 
8
of this magnitude. 
9
(6) The Department of Defense leveraged ac-
10
quisition and supply chain expertise are uniquely 
11
suited to rapidly scale and establish acquisition 
12
strategies, for both procurement of supplies, expan-
13
sion of industrial capabilities and distribution of 
14
such supplies as the COVID–19 response require-
15
ments evolved. 
16
(7) As the combat logistics support agency for 
17
the Nation, the Defense Logistics Agency (‘‘DLA’’) 
18
manages the global supply chain—from raw mate-
19
rials to end user to disposition—for the Army, Ma-
20
rine Corps, Navy, Air Force, Space Force, Coast 
21
Guard, 11 combatant commands, other Federal 
22
agencies, and partner and allied nations. 
23
(8) DLA has supported the COVID–19 re-
24
sponse of the Department of Defense by increasing 
25

•HR 8943 IH
the production and acquisition of critical items 
1
through existing large-scale contracts across multiple 
2
supply chains. 
3
(9) As a logistics integrator and acquisition and 
4
service provider, DLA has the unique capability to 
5
manage the supply chain that few other organiza-
6
tions, public or private, can match to assist States, 
7
local governments, hospitals, and health care pro-
8
viders around the country with supplies so they are 
9
not needlessly competing against one another. 
10
(10) Additionally, the COVID–19 Joint Acqui-
11
sition Task Force (‘‘JATF’’), established by the 
12
Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and 
13
Sustainment, plays a critical role in the national re-
14
sponse to the COVID–19 pandemic. 
15
(11) The JATF’s understanding of reliance on 
16
foreign suppliers, often many tiers down in the sup-
17
ply chain, and the impact of that reliance on pro-
18
ducing at scale has allowed the Secretary of Health 
19
and Human Services to better plan for replenish-
20
ment of the Strategic National Stockpile. 
21
(12) DLA should provide direct support for 
22
States during the COVID–19 pandemic and future 
23
emergencies.

(13) DLA can identify private sector capacity 
1
and assess additional needs for vaccines and supplies 
2
during the COVID–19 pandemic and during future 
3
emergencies. 
4
(14) The Department of Health and Human 
5
Services estimated that healthcare providers may 
6
need 3,500,000,000 face masks to meet potential 
7
long-term need. 
8
(15) Testing capacity and testing materials

have not met existing needs, as well as therapeutics.
