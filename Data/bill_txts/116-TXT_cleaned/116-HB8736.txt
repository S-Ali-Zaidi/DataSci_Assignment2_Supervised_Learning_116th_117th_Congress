A BILL 
To amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to 
allow the sponsor of a drug to use a non-animal test 
as an alternative to an animal test for purposes of dem-
onstrating the safety and effectiveness of a drug if such 
approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable 
statutes and regulations. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
The Congress finds that— 
2
(1) the Food and Drug Administration (in this 
3
section referred to as the ‘‘FDA’’) often requires 
4
pharmaceutical companies to conduct or commission 
5
testing on dogs and other animals to assess the safe-
6
ty or effectiveness of new drugs, even though such 
7
testing is inefficient, expensive, and ineffective; 
8
(2) the National Institutes of Health states, 
9
‘‘Approximately 30 percent of promising medications 
10
have failed in human clinical trials because they are 
11
found to be toxic despite promising preclinical stud-
12
ies in animal models. About 60 percent of candidate 
13
drugs fail due to lack of efficacy’’; 
14
(3) current FDA nonbinding pharmaceutical 
15
testing guidelines support the use of alternatives to 
16
animal testing to improve the effectiveness and effi-
17
ciency of drug development; 
18
(4) current FDA drug testing guidance for the 
19
pharmaceutical 
industry 
states, 
‘‘consideration 
20
should be given to use of new in vitro alternative 
21
methods for safety evaluation’’; 
22
(5) the FDA’s drug testing guidance for indus-
23
try additionally states, ‘‘alternative approaches . . . 
24
can also be used . . . . The use of any of these ap-

proaches can reduce overall animal use in drug de-
1
velopment’’; 
2
(6) the FDA writes that alternatives to animal 
3
testing, ‘‘may help bring FDA-regulated products to 
4
market faster, with improved efficacy, or prevent 
5
products with increased toxicological risk from 
6
reaching the market. Also critical is the potential for 
7
these advances to replace, reduce, and/or refine ani-
8
mal testing’’; 
9
(7) pharmaceutical companies are reducing ani-
10
mal testing by investing in the development and use 
11
of alternative methods, which studies show are often 
12
more effective and efficient than traditional animal 
13
use; 
14
(8) the FDA states, ‘‘FDA encourages sponsors 
15
to consult with us if they wish to use a non-animal 
16
testing method they believe is suitable, adequate, 
17
validated, and feasible’’; and 
18
(9) in some cases, drug manufacturers and 
19
sponsors have not been allowed by the FDA to use 
20
alternatives to animal testing to fulfill regulatory re-
21
quirements, despite the FDA’s support for this tech-
22
nology in its industry guidance document.
