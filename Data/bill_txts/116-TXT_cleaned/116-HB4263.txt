SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Two-thirds of the Amazon rainforest is lo-
3
cated in Brazil’s borders. 
4
(2) The Amazon rainforest is commonly re-
5
ferred to as the ‘‘lungs of the Earth’’. 
6
(3) The Amazon rainforest contains upwards of 
7
100 billion metric tons of sequestered carbon, help-
8
ing to stabilize the Earth’s climate. 
9
(4) The Amazon rainforest is home to 10 per-
10
cent of the Earth’s biodiversity. 
11
(5) More forest has been cleared in Brazil in 
12
the summer 2019 alone than in the last three years 
13
combined. 
14
(6) Brazilian satellites indicate that about three 
15
football fields worth of trees in the Amazon 
16
rainforest located in Brazil were felled every minute 
17
in July 2019. 
18
(7) As of August 26, 2019, there were more 
19
than 41,000 fires burning in the Amazon rainforest. 
20
(8) The National Institute for Space Research 
21
(INPE) reports this to be a 78-percent increase 
22
from fires during the same period in 2018. 
23
(9) These fires have released the equivalent of 
24
228 megatons of carbon so far this year.

(10) Natural fires in the Amazon rainforest are 
1
rare, and the majority of fires are human-caused to 
2
deforest land for agriculture and mining. 
3
(11) Cattle ranching leads to approximately 80 
4
percent of deforestation of the Amazon rainforest. 
5
(12) Soy cultivation has led to the destruction 
6
of 40,000 square miles of native forests in Brazil 
7
since 2008. 
8
(13) Deforestation is taking place illegally in 
9
some of the more than 305 indigenous territories in 
10
Brazil. 
11
(14) Brazilian President Bolsonaro has imple-
12
mented policies that violate the collective and indi-
13
vidual rights of indigenous peoples. 
14
(15) Brazil’s National Indigenous Movement 
15
has called for an international boycott of commod-
16
ities that are in conflict with indigenous territories. 
17
(16) President Bolsonaro has promised to scale 
18
back enforcement of environmental laws. 
19
(17) President Bolsonaro blames nongovern-
20
mental organizations for the fires without evidence. 
21
(18) President Bolsonaro has rejected deforest-
22
ation data from his own government agency, the 
23
INPE, as false and later fired the INPE director for 
24
rebutting his criticisms.

(19) Under President Bolsonaro’s administra-
1
tion, deforestation has spiked by more than 50 per-
2
cent. 
3
(20) President Bolsonaro’s chief of staff said 
4
that G7 aid ‘‘would be put to better use reforesting 
5
Europe’’. 
6
(21) Brazil’s Environment Minister has inhib-
7
ited the environmental enforcement agencies from 
8
investigating environmental crimes. 
9
(22) Brazil’s Environment Minister is a con-
10
victed environmental criminal. 
11
(23) Brazilian government enforcement actions, 
12
including fines and the confiscation and destruction 
13
of illegal equipment, has significantly decreased 
14
under the Bolsonaro administration. 
15
(24) The continued lack of enforcement actions 
16
against deforestation tactics and unwillingness to ag-
17
gressively fight the fires in the Amazon rainforest by 
18
the Government of Brazil poses a direct threat to 
19
United States interests and national security. 
20
(25) The destruction of the Amazon rainforest 
21
poses serious threats to our ecosystem, potentially 
22
significantly affecting agricultural production, in-
23
creasing extreme weather events, and more.

3

4
tively, in 2017, leading the world in exports of both 
5
commodities.
