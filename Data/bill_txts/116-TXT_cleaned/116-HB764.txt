SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The United States maintains an open mar-
3
ket for goods, with relatively low tariffs, and has 
4
long encouraged trading partners, both bilaterally 
5
and in multilateral fora, to liberalize their markets. 
6
(2) The United States is the world’s largest im-
7
porter of goods. 
8
(3) Trading partners of the United States in 
9
many instances impose significantly higher tariffs on 
10
United States goods than the United States imposes 
11
on the same or similar goods imported from those 
12
same countries. 
13
(4) United States trading partners in many in-
14
stances impose significant nontariff barriers that 
15
greatly undermine the value of negotiated tariff con-
16
cessions. 
17
(5) The lack of reciprocity in tariff levels and 
18
disproportionate use of nontariff barriers by United 
19
States trading partners facilitates foreign imports, 
20
discourages United States exports, and puts United 
21
States producers, farmers, and workers at a com-
22
petitive disadvantage. 
23
(6) The lack of reciprocity in tariff levels and 
24
nontariff barriers contributes to the large and grow-
25
ing United States trade deficit in goods, which is a 
26
00:20 Feb 08, 2019
H764
3 
•HR 764 IH
drag on economic growth and undermines economic 
1
prosperity. 
2
(7) To date a number of United States trading 
3
partners have been unwilling, including in multilat-
4
eral negotiations, to reduce tariffs and eliminate 
5
nontariff barriers applied to United States exports. 
6
(8) The United States should seek action by 
7
United States trading partners to lower tariffs and 
8
eliminate nontariff barriers, to promote efficiency in 
9
those markets and enhance opportunities for United 
10
States producers, farmers, and workers. 
11
(9) The President should have a wide array of 
12
tools to open the markets of United States trading 
13
partners and encourage participation in negotiations 
14
to liberalize trade in goods on a fair and reciprocal 
15
basis, including the authority to adjust tariff rates 
16
to reciprocal levels.

TO RECIPROCAL TRADE.

(a) IN
GENERAL.—If the President determines 
20
that— 
21
(1) the rate of duty imposed by a foreign coun-
22
try with respect to a particular good, when imported

•HR 764 IH
the rate of duty imposed by the United States on 
1
that good, when imported from that country, or 
2
(2) the nontariff barriers applied by a foreign 
3
country with respect to a particular good, when im-
4
ported from the United States, impose significantly 
5
higher burdens, alone or in combination with any 
6
tariffs imposed by that country on that good, than 
7
the burdens of the nontariff barriers applied by the 
8
United States with respect to that good, alone or in 
9
combination with any tariffs imposed by the United 
10
States on that good, when imported from that coun-
11
try, 
12
the President may take one or more of the actions author-
13
ized under subsection (b). 
14
(b) ACTIONS AUTHORIZED.—The actions authorized 
15
under this subsection are the following: 
16
(1) To negotiate and seek to enter into an 
17
agreement with the foreign country that commits the 
18
country to reduce the rate of duty or reduce or 
19
eliminate nontariff barriers on the good that is the 
20
subject of the determination under subsection (a). 
21
(2) To impose a rate of duty on imports of the 
22
good that is equal to—

24
country with respect to the good, in the case of 
25
00:20 Feb 08, 2019
H764

•HR 764 IH
a determination described in subsection (a)(1); 
1
or 
2
(B) the effective rate of duty of the non-
3
tariff barriers applied by the foreign country 
4
with respect to the good, alone or in combina-
5
tion with any tariffs imposed by that country 
6
on that good, in the case of a determination de-
7
scribed in subsection (a)(2). 
8
(c) FACTORS.—In taking an action authorized under 
9
subsection (b), the President shall consider the following 
10
factors: 
11
(1) The tariff classification of the good by the 
12
United States and the tariff classification of the 
13
good by the foreign country. 
14
(2) The rate of duty applied by the United 
15
States with respect to the good and the rate of duty 
16
applied by the foreign country with respect to the 
17
good. 
18
(3) The physical characteristics of the good. 
19
(4) The end uses and existence of a competitive 
20
relationship between the good— 
21
(A) as exported from the United States to 
22
the foreign country; and 
23
(B) as imported from the country to the 
24
United States. 
25
00:20 Feb 08, 2019

•HR 764 IH
(5) The level of exports of the good by the 
1
country to the United States and to other countries. 
2
(6) In the case of a determination described in 
3
subsection (a)(1), the extent to which the rate of 
4
duty applied by the foreign country with respect to 
5
the good is impeding or distorting trade. 
6
(7) In the case of a determination described in 
7
subsection (a)(2)— 
8
(A) the extent of the nontariff barriers ap-
9
plied by the foreign country with respect to the 
10
good and the extent of the nontariff barriers 
11
applied by the United States with respect to the 
12
good; 
13
(B) the extent to which the nontariff bar-
14
riers applied by the country with respect to the 
15
good, alone or in combination with any tariffs 
16
imposed by that country on that good, are im-
17
peding or distorting trade; 
18
(C) the identified purpose of the nontariff 
19
barriers applied by the country with respect to 
20
the good, if any, and the extent to which the 
21
nontariff barriers are more restrictive than nec-
22
essary to meet that purpose; and 
23
00:20 Feb 08, 2019
H764
7 
•HR 764 IH
(D) the degree of transparency of the proc-

appropriate.

(d) ROLE OF USTR.—The United States Trade Rep-
6
resentative, in consultation with the Secretary of Treas-
7
ury, the Secretary of Commerce, and the heads of other

termining the effective rate of duty imposed by the non-
10
tariff barriers applied by a foreign country with respect 
11
to a good, alone or in combination with any tariffs imposed 
12
by that country on that good, in the case of a determina-
13
tion described in subsection (a)(2). 
14
(e) LOWER RATE OF DUTY.—The President may im-
15
pose a rate of duty on imports of a good from a foreign 
16
country that is lower than the rate of duty described in 
17
subsection (b)(2)(A) or lower than the effective rate of 
18
duty described in subsection (b)(2)(B), as the case may 
19
be, if the President determines that application of such 
20
lower rate of duty is necessary and appropriate. 
21
(f) HIGHER RATE OF DUTY.—If the President im-
22
poses a rate of duty on imports of a good from a foreign 
23
country under subsection (b)(2), and the country further 
24
increases its rate of duty on imports of the good from the 
25
00:20 Feb 08, 2019
H764

•HR 764 IH
United States, the President may further increase the rate 
1
of duty on imports of the good from the country to a rate 
2
that is equal to the rate of duty applied by that country. 
3
(g) TERMINATION.—The President shall terminate 
4
the imposition of any increase in the rate of duty on im-
5
ports of a good from a foreign country under subsection 
6
(b)(2) effective on the date on which the President deter-
7
mines that— 
8

10
the good, as described in subsection (a)(1); or 
11
(B) applying nontariff barriers with re-
12
spect to the good, as described in subsection 
13
(a)(2); or 
14
(2) continued imposition of the increased rate 
15
of duty on imports of the good from the foreign 
16
country is not in the economic or public interest of 
17
the United States.
