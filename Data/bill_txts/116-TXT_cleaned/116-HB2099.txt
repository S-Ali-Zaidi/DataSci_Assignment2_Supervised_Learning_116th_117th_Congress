SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
3
Congress makes the following findings: 
4
(1) Fish and wildlife are important natural re-
5
sources of the United States. They belong to all citi-
6
zens, and are managed in perpetuity by State and 
7
Federal conservation agencies, often with significant 
8
assistance from universities, zoos, aquariums, and 
9
nonprofit and nongovernmental organizations. 
10
(2) Wildlife and zoological veterinarians are the 
11
primary source of essential health care for wild ani-
12
mals in their natural habitat and in captivity in fa-
13
cilities such as zoos, wildlife refuges, breeding re-
14
serves, and aquariums.

(3) Wildlife and zoological veterinarians have 
1
the resources and expertise necessary to help re-
2
spond to environmental disasters and address short- 
3
term and long-term impacts on wildlife and their 
4
habitats. Wildlife and zoological veterinarians have 
5
proven to be essential to the rescue and rehabilita-
6
tion efforts in the Gulf of Mexico region following 
7
the Deepwater Horizon oil spill that began on April 
8
20, 2010. 
9
(4) According to the Department of the Inte-
10
rior, wildlife disease expertise and resources are crit-
11
ical to protecting both human and animal life. 
12
(5) Wildlife veterinarians have been actively in-
13
volved in preventing, detecting, and responding to 
14
such important exotic, dangerous, and zoonotic dis-
15
eases as anthrax, avian influenza, brucellosis, tuber-
16
culosis, West Nile virus, SARS, chronic wasting dis-
17
ease, and foot and mouth disease. 
18
(6) Globalization, climate change, and wildlife 
19
habitat loss and alteration, along with a growing 
20
interface among humans, livestock, and wildlife have 
21
increased the threat posed by emerging infectious 
22
diseases to humans, domestic animals, and wildlife. 
23
(7) According to the February 2009 report by 
24
the Government Accountability Office entitled ‘‘Vet-

erinarian Workforce: Actions Are Needed to Ensure 
1
Sufficient Capacity for Protecting Public and Ani-
2
mal Health’’, the Nation is facing a growing short-
3
age of veterinarians, and the Federal Government 
4
may not have the necessary veterinarian workforce 
5
to control pandemic and large-scale outbreaks of dis-
6
ease. 
7
(8) There is a shortage of positions for wildlife 
8
and zoological veterinarians at the State, Federal, 
9
nonprofit, and university levels due to inadequate 
10
funding. According to the American Veterinary Med-
11
ical Association (‘‘AVMA’’), less than one percent of 
12
AVMA members identify themselves as wildlife or 
13
zoological veterinarians. 
14
(9) According to the AVMA, a growing number 
15
of students enter veterinary schools with an interest 
16
in wildlife or zoological veterinary medicine, but 
17
choose different fields of study and practice due to 
18
the small number of positions available for wildlife 
19
and zoological veterinarians upon graduation. 
20
(10) Veterinary students face large educational 
21
debt upon graduation. According to the AVMA, 
22
graduating student loan debt averaged $143,757 in 
23
2016.

•HR 2099 IH
(11) According to the American Association of 
1
Wildlife Veterinarians (‘‘AAWV’’) and National As-
2
sociation of Federal Veterinarians (‘‘NAFV’’), sala-
3
ries for wildlife and zoological veterinarians are rel-
4
atively low, the second-to-lowest specialty, compared 
5
to the average salaries of veterinarians in companion 
6
animal medicine. Lower salaries, combined with high 
7
educational debt and the small number of positions 
8
available in wildlife and zoological veterinary medi-
9
cine, discourage students from pursuing careers in 
10
wildlife or zoological veterinary medicine. 
11
(12) According to the AAWV and NAFV, most 
12
schools and colleges of veterinary medicine lack both 
13
a comprehensive curriculum and sufficient numbers 
14
of formal educational programs and internships spe-
15
cializing in wildlife or zoological veterinary medicine 
16
to adequately prepare graduates for a competitive 
17
workplace. 
18
(13) According to the AVMA, while some train-
19
ing opportunities exist for aspiring wildlife and zoo-
20
logical veterinarians, such opportunities are not 
21
available each year, pay low salaries or stipends, if 
22
any, and are highly competitive.
