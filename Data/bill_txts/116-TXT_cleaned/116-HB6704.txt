1
viduals experiencing homelessness, and individuals at 
2
risk of homelessness, making it difficult for them to 
3
pay their mortgages or rents on time; 
4
(2) housing counseling is critical to ensuring 
5
that homeowners, renters, individuals experiencing 
6
homelessness, and individuals at risk of homeless-

ness have the resources they need to manage finan-
8
cial hardships from the COVID-19 crisis; 
9
(3) foreclosure mitigation services are also crit-
10
ical to address the needs of homeowners who lose 
11
employment and income because of the pandemic 
12
and who face serious delinquency or mortgage de-
13
fault, or are in foreclosing proceedings during this 
14
period; 
15
(4) evaluations from the National Foreclosure 
16
Mitigation Counseling program revealed that home-
17
owners at risk of or facing foreclosure are better 
18
served when they have access to a housing counselor 
19
and a range of tools and resources to help them 
20
avoid losing their home and have the support they 
21
need to tailor the best possible response to their sit-
