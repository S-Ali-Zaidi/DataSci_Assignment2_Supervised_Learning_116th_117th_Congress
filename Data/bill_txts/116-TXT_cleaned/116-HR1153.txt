RESOLUTION 
Condemning unwanted, unnecessary medical procedures on 
individuals without their full, informed consent. 
Whereas there is a shameful history in the United States of 
Black, Indigenous, people of color, immigrants, poor peo-
ple, and people with disabilities being subjected to med-
ical procedures without their informed consent; 
Whereas 32 States passed eugenic-sterilization laws, resulting 
in the sterilization of between 60,000 to 70,000 people 
beginning in the early 1900s; 
Whereas 25 percent of Native American women of child-
bearing age were sterilized over the course of 6 years 
after the passage of the Family Planning Services and 
Population Research Act of 1970; 
Whereas incarcerated individuals have continued to face steri-
lization practices, including nearly 150 incarcerated 
women in California prisons sterilized between 2006 and 
2010;

County Detention Center in Ocilla, Georgia, including de-

share stories of unwanted, unnecessary medical proce-
dures, including full or partial hysterectomies and other 
procedures involving their reproductive organs, performed 
without their knowledge or consent; 
Whereas, on September 16, 2020, U.S. Immigration and 
Customs Enforcement nearly deported a woman who was 
formerly detained at Irwin County Detention Center who 
had one fallopian tube removed without her knowledge or 
consent; 
Whereas, on September 18, 2020, 4 women came forward 
saying that they did not approve of the procedures they 
received; 
Whereas an initial review of available medical records by 
independent gynecologists raises serious questions about 
whether patients detained at the Irwin County Detention 
Center provided informed consent and whether prevailing 
standards of care were adhered to in their care; and 
Whereas these allegations indicate a failure by U.S. Immigra-
