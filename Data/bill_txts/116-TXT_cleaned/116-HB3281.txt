A BILL 
To prohibit deceptive practices in Federal elections. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Deceptive Practices 
4
and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act of 2019’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress makes the following findings: 
2
(1) The right to vote by casting a ballot for 
3
one’s preferred candidate is a fundamental right ac-
4
corded to United States citizens by the Constitution, 
5
and the unimpeded exercise of this right is essential 
6
to the functioning of our democracy. 
7
(2) Historically, certain citizens, especially ra-
8
cial, ethnic, and language minorities, were prevented 
9
from voting because of significant barriers such as 
10
literacy tests, poll taxes, and property ownership re-
11
quirements. 
12
(3) Some of these barriers were removed by the 
13
15th, 19th, and 24th Amendments to the Constitu-
14
tion. 
15
(4) Despite the elimination of some of these 
16
barriers to the polls, the integrity of today’s elec-
17
tions is threatened by newer tactics aimed at sup-
18
pressing voter turnout. These tactics include ‘‘decep-
19
tive practices’’, which involve the dissemination of 
20
false or misleading information intended to prevent 
21
voters from casting their ballots, prevent voters from 
22
voting for the candidate of their choice, intimidate 
23
the electorate, and undermine the integrity of the 
24
electoral process.

•HR 3281 IH
(5) Furthermore, since the decision in Shelby 
1
County v. Holder in which the Supreme Court 
2
struck down the coverage formula used by the Vot-
3
ing Rights Act of 1965 to determine which States 
4
with a history of racial discrimination must affirma-
5
tively receive government permission before changing 
6
local voting laws, there have been Federal court de-
7
cisions finding or affirming that States or localities 
8
intentionally discriminated against African Ameri-
9
cans and other voters of color. 
10
(6) Denials of the right to vote, and deceptive 
11
practices designed to prevent members of racial, eth-
12
nic, and language minorities from exercising that 
13
right, are an outgrowth of discriminatory history, in-
14
cluding slavery. Measures to combat denials of that 
15
right are a legitimate exercise of congressional power 
16
under article I, section 4 and article II, section 1 of, 
17
and the 14th and 15th Amendments to, the United 
18
States Constitution. 
19
(7) For the last few decades, there have been 
20
a number of instances of deceptive or intimidating 
21
practices aimed towards suppressing minority access 
22
to the voting booth that demonstrates the need for 
23
strengthened protections.

(8) In addition, in at least one instance in 
1
1990, thousands of voters reportedly received post-
2
cards providing false information about voter eligi-
3
bility and warnings about criminal penalties for 
4
voter fraud. Most of the voters who received the 
5
postcards were African American. 
6
(9) During the 2004 elections, Native American 
7
voters in South Dakota reported being required to 
8
provide photographic identification in order to vote, 
9
despite the fact that neither State nor Federal law 
10
required such identification. 
11
(10) In the 2006 midterm elections, thousands 
12
of Latino voters received mailings warning them in 
13
Spanish that voting in a Federal election as an im-
14
migrant could result in incarceration—despite the 
15
fact that any immigrant who is a naturalized citizen 
16
of the United States has the same right to vote as 
17
any other citizen. 
18
(11) In 2008, fliers were distributed in pre-
19
dominantly African-American neighborhoods falsely 
20
warning that people with outstanding warrants or 
21
unpaid parking tickets could be arrested if they 
22
showed up at the polls on Election Day. In the same 
23
year, there were reports of people receiving text mes-
24
04:23 Jun 18, 2019
H3281
5 
•HR 3281 IH
sages on Election Day asking them to wait until the 
1
following day to vote. 
2
(12) In 2012, there were reports of voters re-
3
ceiving calls falsely informing them that they could 
4
vote via telephone. 
5
(13) In the 2016 elections, there were reports 
6
of students receiving fliers stating that in order to 
7
vote in a local precinct, they had to pay to change 
8
their driver’s license and re-register vehicles in the 
9
city in which the precinct was located. 
10
(14) Those responsible for these and similar ef-
11
forts should be held accountable, and civil and crimi-
12
nal penalties should be available to punish anyone 
13
who seeks to keep voters away from the polls by pro-
14
viding false information. 
15
(15) Moreover, the Federal Government should 
16
help correct such false information in order to assist 
17
voters in exercising their right to vote without confu-
18
sion and to preserve the integrity of the electoral 
19
process. 
20
(16) The Federal Government has a compelling 
21
interest in ‘‘protecting voters from confusion and 
22
undue influence’’ and in ‘‘preserving the integrity of 
23
its election process’’. Burson v. Freeman, 504 U.S. 
24
191, 199 (1992).

•HR 3281 IH
(17) The First Amendment does not preclude 
1
the regulation of some intentionally false speech, 
2
even if it is political in nature. As the Supreme 
3
Court of the United States has recognized, ‘‘[t]hat 
4
speech is used as a tool for political ends does not 
5
automatically bring it under the protective mantle of 
6
the Constitution. For the use of the known lie as a 
7
tool is at once at odds with the premises of demo-
8
cratic government and with the orderly manner in 
9
which economic, social, or political change is to be 
10
effected . . . . Hence the knowingly false statement 
11
and the false statement made with reckless disregard 
12
of the truth, do not enjoy constitutional protection.’’.
