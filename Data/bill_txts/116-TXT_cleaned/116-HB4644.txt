(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following find-
2
ings: 
3

4
is critical to the security of the United States, Eu-
5
rope, North Africa, and the Sahel, as well as mari-
6
time routes in the southern Mediterranean Sea.

(AFRICOM), told the Senate Armed Services Com-
1
mittee in March 2017, ‘‘instability in Libya and 
2
North Africa may be the most significant, near-term 
3
threat to U.S. and allies’ interests on the continent’’. 
4
(3) AFRICOM identifies containing instability 
5
in Libya as one of its six main lines of effort in Afri-
6
ca and works to support diplomatic efforts to recon-
7
stitute the Libyan state and to disrupt terrorist or-
8
ganizations that impede that process or threaten 
9
United States interests. 
10
(4) According to the Director of National Intel-
11
ligence, as of 2019, the capabilities of the Libya- 
12
based Islamic State (ISIS) affiliate ‘‘have been de-
13
graded, but it is still capable of conducting attacks 
14
on local and Western targets in Libya and possibly 
15
elsewhere in the region’’. According to United Na-
16
tions Special Representative of the Secretary Gen-
17
eral (SRSG) Ghassan Salame´, ISIS has conducted 
18
six attacks since April 4, 2019. 
19
(5) On September 22, 2016, a Joint Commu-
20
nique on Libya, signed by Egypt, Italy, Qatar, Rus-
21
sia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the United Arab Emir-
22
ates, and others, reaffirmed a joint ‘‘commitment to

[UNSMIL] efforts under the leadership of the UN

Special Representative of the Secretary General’’.

(6) On March 1, 2019, the United States Gov-
3
ernment, along with the governments of France, 
4
Italy, and the United Kingdom, reiterated its strong 
5
support to the diplomatic efforts of SRSG Ghassan 
6
Salame´ and UNSMIL, rejected a military solution in 
7
Libya, and called on all Libyans to work construc-
8
tively with SRSG Salame´ to realize a stable and uni-
9
fied government that can deliver security and pros-
10
perity for all Libyans. 
11
(7) UNSMIL planned to host a long-awaited 
12
National Conference in Ghadames, Libya to begin 
13
on April 12, 2019, to help the Libyan people nego-
14
tiate a path toward interim governance structures 
15
and credible and secure elections. 
16
(8) On April 4, 2019, Khalifa Haftar, the com-
17
mander of the Libyan National Army (LNA) move-
18
ment ordered forces loyal to him to begin a unilat-
19
eral military operation to take control of Tripoli, the 
20
capital of Libya. 
21
(9) Tripoli is the seat of the Government of Na-
22
tional Accord (GNA), an interim body that emerged 
23
from previous United Nations-backed negotiations 
24
and that the United States Government and the 
25
03:44 Oct 12, 2019
H4644
5 
•HR 4644 IH
United Nations Security Council have recognized 
1
since 2015. 
2
(10) Both the LNA movement, the GNA, and 
3
their associated forces have failed to observe their 
4
obligations under international humanitarian law, in-
5
creased the geographic scope of the conflict, ignored 
6
calls for de-escalation and a ceasefire, recruited for-
7
eign mercenaries, and intensified ground and air 
8
campaigns using heavy weapons, aircraft, and re-
9
portedly using armed drones provided by foreign 
10
powers. 
11
(11) Without the full cooperation of all United 
12
Nations Member States in implementing the arms 
13
embargo in accordance with United Nations Security 
14
Council Resolution 2473 (2019), and all relevant 
15
predecessor resolutions, the flow of weapons to 
16
Libya will continue to fuel the conflict. 
17
(12) According to SRSG Salame´, weapons pro-
18
vided by foreign powers to the warring parties are 
19
being sold to or captured by terrorist groups active 
20
in Libya. 
21
(13) According to the United Nations, since the 
22
LNA movement offensive began in April 2019, the 
23
conflict in Libya has led to the deaths of more than 
24
03:44 Oct 12, 2019
H4644

•HR 4644 IH
1,100 people and the displacement of more than 
1
120,000 people. 
2
(14) Both the LNA movement and opposing 
3
forces have requisitioned the houses of civilians, tar-
4
geted medical facilities, and inhibited humanitarian 
5
access to food, health, and other life-saving services, 
6
worsening humanitarian conditions. 
7
(15) More than 5,100 refugees and migrants 
8
are detained in detention facilities in Libya, includ-
9
ing more than 3,000 in and around the conflict 
10
zones in Tripoli, with serious risks of torture, star-
11
vation, sexual abuse, and death. On July 2, 2019, an 
12
airstrike against the Tajura Detention Center killed 
13
53 and wounded 130 people trapped in the center. 
14
The United Nations has called for the immediate re-
15
lease, evacuation, and protection of refugees and mi-
16
grants detained in conflict zones. 
17
(b) STATEMENT OF POLICY.—It is the policy of the 
18
United States— 
19
(1) to assert there is no military solution to the 
20
conflict in Libya and that only a political process 
21
can secure United States interests, ensure a stable 
22
and unified Libya, reduce the threat of terrorism, 
23
and provide peace and opportunity to the Libyan 
24
people;
