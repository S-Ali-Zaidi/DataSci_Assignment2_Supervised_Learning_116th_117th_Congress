Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘ ‘Six Triple Eight’ Con-
4
gressional Gold Medal Act of 2019’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) On July 1, 1943, President Franklin D. 
8
Roosevelt signed into law legislation that established 
9
the Women’s Army Corps (referred to in this section 
10
as the ‘‘WAC’’) as a component in the Army. The 
11
WAC was converted from the Women’s Army Auxil-
12
iary Corps (referred to in this section as the 
13
‘‘WAAC’’), which had been created in 1942 without 
14
official military status. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt 
15
and Mary McLeod Bethune, the founder of the Na-
16
tional Council of Negro Women, advocated for the 
17
admittance of African-American women into the 
18
newly formed WAC to serve as officers and enlisted 
19
personnel. 
20
(2) Dubbed ‘‘10 percenters’’, the recruitment of 
21
African-American women to the WAAC was limited 
22
to 10 percent of the population of the WAAC to 
23
match the proportion of African Americans in the 
24
national population. Despite an Executive order 
25

•HR 3138 IH
issued by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1941 
1
banning racial discrimination in civilian defense in-
2
dustries, the Armed Forces remained segregated. 
3
Enlisted women served in segregated units, partici-
4
pated in segregated training, lived in separate quar-
5
ters, ate at separate tables in mess halls, and used 
6
segregated recreational facilities. Officers received 
7
their officer candidate training in integrated units 
8
but lived under segregated conditions. Specialist and 
9
technical training schools were integrated in 1943. 
10
During World War II, a total of 6,520 African- 
11
American women served in the WAAC and the 
12
WAC. 
13
(3) After several units of White women were 
14
sent to serve in the European theater of operations 
15
(referred to in this section as the ‘‘ETO’’) during 
16
World War II, African-American organizations advo-
17
cated for the War Department to extend the oppor-
18
tunity to serve overseas to African-American WAC 
19
units. 
20
(4) In November 1944, the War Department 
21
approved sending African-American women to serve 
22
in Europe. A battalion of all African-American 
23
women drawn from the WAC, the Army Service 
24
Forces, and the Army Air Forces was created and 
25

•HR 3138 IH
designated as the 6888th Central Postal Directory 
1
Battalion (referred to in this section as the 
2
‘‘6888th’’), which was nicknamed the ‘‘Six Triple 
3
Eight’’. 
4
(5) With the exception of smaller units of Afri-
5
can-American nurses who served in Africa, Aus-
6
tralia, and England, the 6888th was the only Afri-
7
can-American women’s unit to serve overseas during 
8
World War II. 
9
(6) Army officials reported a shortage of quali-
10
fied postal officers within the ETO, which resulted 
11
in a backlog of undelivered mail. As Allied forces 
12
drove across Europe, the ever-changing locations of 
13
servicemembers hampered the delivery of mail to 
14
those servicemembers. One general predicted that 
15
the backlog in Birmingham, England, would take 6 
16
months to process and the lack of reliable mail serv-
17
ice was hurting morale. 
18
(7) In May 1945, the 6888th arrived in Bir-
19
mingham. Upon their arrival, the 6888th found 
20
warehouses filled with millions of pieces of mail in-
21
tended for members of the Armed Forces, United 
22
States Government personnel, and Red Cross work-
23
ers serving in the ETO.

•HR 3138 IH
(8) The 6888th created effective processes and 
1
filing systems to track individual servicemembers, 
2
organize ‘‘undeliverable’’ mail, determine the in-
3
tended recipient for insufficiently addressed mail, 
4
and handle mail addressed to servicemembers who 
5
had died. Adhering to their motto of ‘‘No mail, low 
6
morale’’, the women processed an average of 65,000 
7
pieces of mail per shift and cleared the 6-month 
8
backlog of mail within 3 months. 
9
(9) The 6888th traveled to Rouen, France, 
10
later in May 1945 and worked through a separate 
11
backlog of undelivered mail dating back as far as 3 
12
years. 
13
(10) At the completion of their mission, the en-
14
tire unit returned to the United States. The 6888th 
15
was discontinued on March 9, 1946, at Fort Dix, 
16
New Jersey. 
17
(11) These women faced racism and sexism, 
18
and worked in austere conditions, but were able to 
19
clear more than 18,000,000 pieces of backlog mail 
20
for Americans in the ETO. Three died in France 
21
and are buried in Normandy, France, while three 
22
others were beaten in a bus station in Kentucky. 
23
(12) According to the Department of Defense, 
24
during the period between February 1945 and Feb-
25
04:47 Jun 13, 2019

•HR 3138 IH
ruary 1946, the members of the ‘‘Six Triple Eight’’ 
1
‘‘displayed meritorious service while deployed to 
2
England and France’’ and ‘‘conducted combat sup-
3
port operation which impacted the morale and wel-
4
fare of U.S. servicemembers fighting across the Eu-
5
ropean continent’’. 
6
(13) The Department of the Army awarded its 
7
Meritorious Unit Commendation award to the mem-
8
bers of the ‘‘Six Triple Eight’’ noting that their 
9
‘‘professionalism and dedication are in keeping with 
10
the finest tradition of military service and reflect 
11
great credit upon themselves, the Women’s Army 
12
Corps, and the U.S. Army’’. 
13
(14) The accomplishments of the 6888th in Eu-
14
rope encouraged the General Board, United States 
15
Forces, European Theater of Operations to adopt 
16
the following premise in their study of the WAC 
17
issued in December 1945: ‘‘[T]he national security 
18
program is the joint responsibility of all Americans 
19
irrespective of color or sex’’ and ‘‘the continued use 
20
of colored, along with white, female military per-
21
sonnel is required in such strength as is proportion-
22
ately appropriate to the relative population distribu-
23
tion between colored and white races’’.

(16) While over 850 African-American women 
6
from across the United States have been docu-
7
mented to serve overseas with the ‘‘Six Triple
