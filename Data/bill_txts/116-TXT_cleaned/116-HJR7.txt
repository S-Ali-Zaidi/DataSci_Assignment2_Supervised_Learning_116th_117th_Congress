JOINT RESOLUTION 
Proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United 
States to abolish the electoral college and to provide 
for the direct election of the President and Vice Presi-
dent of the United States. 
Whereas the Founders of the Nation established the electoral 
college in an era of limited nationwide communication 
and information sharing; 
Whereas the electoral college is premised on an antiquated 
theory that citizens will have a better chance of knowing 
about electors from their home States than about Presi-
dential candidates from out of State; 
Whereas the development of mass media and the Internet has 
made information about Presidential candidates easily ac-

cessible to United States citizens across the country and 
around the world; 
Whereas citizens now have a far better chance of knowing 
about out-of-State Presidential candidates than about 
Presidential electors from their home State; 
Whereas Thomas Jefferson wrote, ‘‘I am not an advocate for 
frequent changes in laws and constitutions, but laws and 
institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of 
the human mind. As that becomes more developed, more 
enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new truths dis-
covered and manners and opinions change, with the 
change of circumstances, institutions must advance also 
to keep pace with the times. We might as well require a 
man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy 
as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of 
their barbarous ancestors.’’; 
Whereas since the Nation’s founding, United States citizens 
have amended the Constitution to expand the opportunity 
for citizens to directly elect their elected leaders; 
Whereas the 15th Amendment guarantees the right of all citi-
zens to vote regardless of race; 
Whereas the 19th Amendment guarantees the right of all citi-
zens to vote regardless of gender; 
Whereas the 26th Amendment guarantees the right of all citi-
zens 18 years of age and older to vote regardless of age; 
Whereas the 17th Amendment establishes both a precedent 
and a preference for the direct election of citizens’ elected 
representatives; and 
Whereas the electoral college has become an anachronism: 
Now, therefore, be it
