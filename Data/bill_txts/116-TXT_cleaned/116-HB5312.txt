(1) IN GENERAL.—The Speaker of the House of 
1
Representatives, the President pro tempore of the 
2
Senate, and the Secretary of Education shall estab-
3
lish an independent commission, comprised of key 
4
stakeholders, to develop voluntary guidelines for ac-
5
cessible postsecondary electronic instructional mate-
6
rials and related technologies in order— 
7
(A) to ensure students with disabilities are 
8
afforded the same educational benefits provided 
9
to nondisabled students through the use of elec-
10
tronic instructional materials and related tech-
11
nologies; 
12
(B) to inform better the selection and use 
13
of such materials and technologies at institu-
14
tions of higher education; and 
15
(C) to encourage entities that produce such 
16
materials and technologies to make accessible 
17
versions more readily available in the market. 
18
In fulfilling the duties set forth in subparagraphs 
19
(1)(A), (1)(B), and (1)(C), the commission shall re-
20
view applicable national and international informa-
21

COMMISSION.— 
6
(1) VOLUNTARY GUIDELINES.—It is the intent 
7
of the Congress that use of the voluntary guidelines 
8
developed pursuant to this Act is and should remain 
9
voluntary. The voluntary guidelines shall not confer 
10
any rights or impose any obligations on commission 
11
participants, institutions of higher education, or 
12
other persons. Thus, no department or agency of the 
13
Federal Government may incorporate the voluntary 
14
guidelines, whether produced as a discrete document 
15
or electronic resource, into regulations promulgated 
16
under the Rehabilitation Act, the Americans with 
17
Disabilities Act, or any other Federal law or instru-
18
ment. This restriction applies only to the voluntary 
19
guidelines as a discrete document or resource; it im-
20
poses no limitation on Federal use of standards or 
21
resources to which the voluntary guidelines may 
22
refer.

24
gress that use of the annotated list of information

1
is and should remain voluntary. The annotated list 
2
shall not confer any rights or impose any obligations 
3
on commission participants, institutions of higher 
4
education, or other persons. Thus, no department or 
5
agency of the Federal Government may incorporate 
6
the annotated list, whether produced as a discrete 
7
document or electronic resource into regulations pro-
8
mulgated under the Rehabilitation Act, the Ameri-
9

or instrument. This provision applies only to the an-
11
notated list as a discrete document or resource; it 
12
imposes no limitation on Federal use of standards or 
13
resources to which the annotated list may refer. 
14
(3) PILOT TESTING FRAMEWORK.—It is the in-
15
tent of Congress that use of the model framework 
16
for pilot testing postsecondary instructional mate-
17
rials and related technologies developed pursuant to 
18
this Act is and should remain voluntary. The pilot 
19
testing framework shall not confer any rights or im-
20
pose any obligations on commission participants, in-
21
stitutions of higher education, or other persons.

Thus, no department or agency of the Federal Gov-
