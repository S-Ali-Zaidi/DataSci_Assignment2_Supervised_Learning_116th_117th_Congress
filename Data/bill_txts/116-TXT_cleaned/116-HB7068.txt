during elections for Federal office.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘VoteSafe Act of 2020’’. 
4
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
5
Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) The right to vote is the foundation of Amer-
7
ican democracy. Voting provides the citizenry with a 
8
vital check on their elected officials and grants peo-
9
ple the political power necessary to exercise and de-
10
fend the rights guaranteed by the United States 
11
Constitution. 
12
(2) The Elections Clause of the United States 
13
Constitution gives Congress sweeping power to regu-
14
late the time, place, and manner of Federal elections 
15
(Article I, section 4 of the Constitution of the 
16
United States; see also Arizona v. Inter Tribal 
17
Council of Arizona, Inc., 570 U.S. 1 (2013)). Con-
18
gress also has enforcement power under the Four-
19
teenth and Fifteenth Amendments of the Constitu-
20
tion of the United States. 
21
(3) As Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., explained 
22
in a speech delivered on May 17, 1957, ‘‘So long as 
23
I do not firmly and irrevocably possess the right to 
24
vote I do not possess myself. I cannot make up my 
25

•HR 7068 IH
mind—it is made up for me. I cannot live as a 
1
democratic citizen, observing the laws I have helped 
2
to enact—I can only submit to the edict of others.’’. 
3
(4) The right to vote was not guaranteed to all 
4
Americans at our Nation’s founding. The ratification 
5
of the Fifteenth and Nineteenth Amendments, the 
6
civil rights movement’s struggle for justice and 
7
equality, and the enactment of the Voting Rights 
8
Act of 1965 and its subsequent amendments suc-
9
ceeded in expanding access to the franchise. 
10
(5) Unfortunately, the barriers faced by voters 
11
who have historically experienced the greatest obsta-
12
cles to voting are exacerbated by the coronavirus 
13
(COVID–19) pandemic. 
14
(6) Strategies to mitigate the spread of 
15
COVID–19 include ‘‘social distancing’’, a practice 
16
that requires individuals to maintain a distance be-
17
tween themselves and other people in order to avoid 
18
acquiring or transmitting the virus. The need to em-
19
brace such precautions will require States to quickly 
20
modify voting processes to minimize person-to-per-
21
son contact. 
22
(7) Voting by mail is a critical part of the solu-
23
tion and must be expanded as quickly as possible, 
24
not simply as a means of ensuring access during 
25
02:01 Jun 23, 2020
H7068

•HR 7068 IH
public health emergencies, but also as a means of ex-
1
panding access to the franchise to those whose work, 
2
health, or ability to access the ballot may be limited. 
3
(8) However, safe and secure in-person voting 
4
remains vitally important for large groups of voters, 
5
including voters with disabilities, language minority 
6
voters, American Indian and Alaska Native voters, 
7
and African-American voters. 
8
(9) The Americans with Disabilities Act of 
9
1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.) and the Rehabilita-
10
tion Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 701 et seq.) require 
11
that individuals with disabilities have equal access to 
12
every aspect of the voting process. Vote-by-mail 
13
poses various accessibility challenges for voters with 
14
disabilities, including blind, low-vision, or other 
15
print-disabled voters who may require in-person vot-
16
ing or assistive technology in order to privately and 
17
independently mark their ballots. Remedies for vot-
18
ers with disabilities require an investment of re-
19
sources to ensure State and local election websites, 
20
online voter registration portals, and vote-by-mail 
21
systems are accessible; that in-person voting loca-
22
tions permit a safe, dignified, and accessible voting 
23
experience; and that the right of voters with disabil-
24

•HR 7068 IH
ities to a secret ballot is not sacrificed due to the 
1
pandemic. 
2
(10) Language minority voters face unique bar-
3
riers to voting that require additional resources and 
4
support to ensure full and equal access, including 
5
additional resources to ensure local compliance with 
6
the language minority voting protections in section 
7
203 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (52 U.S.C. 
8
10503) and greater language assistance services, in-
9
cluding additional bilingual or multilingual poll 
10
workers and election workers. 
11
(11) American Indian and Alaska Native voters 
12
face unique obstacles in a vote-by-mail system. Trib-
13
al communities in rural areas often do not have tra-
14
ditional residential mailing addresses and have lim-
15
ited access to transportation. Tribal members have 
16
distant rural post offices, slow mail routes, limited 
17
numbers of post office operation, and too few post 
18
office boxes. As a result, rural Tribal communities 
19
require distinct voting accommodations to ensure 
20
participation in a vote-by-mail system. 
21
(12) Finally, in-person voting holds great sig-
22
nificance for African-American voters, for whom the 
23
right to vote was hard won. African Americans have 
24
been excluded from the franchise through State and 
25
02:01 Jun 23, 2020
H7068
ctelli on DSK30NT082PROD with BILLS
6 
•HR 7068 IH
local laws, poll taxes, voting literacy tests, physical 
1
violence, and lynchings. For many African-American 
2
voters today, casting a ballot at one’s polling place 
3
is a solemn ritual that honors those who sacrificed 
4
their safety and their lives in order to secure the 
5
right to vote. However, COVID–19 poses substantial 
6
risks to the African-American population and has in-
7
fected and killed African Americans in the United 
8
States at disproportionately high rates, highlighting 
9
longstanding inequalities in resources and access to 
10
health care. 
11
(13) Social distancing designed to curb the 
12
COVID–19 pandemic will also greatly impact in-per-
13
son voter registration efforts, including voter reg-
14
istration drives and voter registration services re-
15
quired by the National Voter Registration Act. Many 
16
government offices, like State departments of motor 
17
vehicles, are currently closed to in-person traffic and 
18
are likely to remain closed for an indefinite period 
19
of time in 2020. 
20
(14) Therefore, it is appropriate for Congress 
21
to expand no-excuse absentee vote-by-mail while also 
22
ensuring the safety and accessibility of in-person 
23
voting and voter registration during exigent cir-
24
cumstances, including the current pandemic.
