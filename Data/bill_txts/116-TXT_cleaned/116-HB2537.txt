To defer removal of certain nationals of Iraq for a 24- 
month period, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Deferred Removal for

Iraqi Nationals Including Minorities Act of 2019’’.

(1) There are over 1,000 Iraqi nationals living 
1
in the United States who have been ordered re-
2
moved. Over the past three decades, Iraq has gen-
3
erally declined permission for repatriation of its na-
4
tionals, so that many Iraqis who were ordered re-
5
moved could not be repatriated. As a result, the re-
6
moval orders for many Iraqis are years or decades 
7
old, and are not based on current country condi-
8
tions. 
9
(2) Conditions in Iraq have worsened dramati-
10
cally since these removal orders were entered. Re-
11
moval orders entered years or decades ago do not re-
12
liably indicate whether an Iraqi is currently remov-
13
able based on current country conditions and cur-
14
rent law. Iraq’s humanitarian, security, and refugee 
15
crisis has resulted in extraordinary conditions that 
16
today prevent many Iraqi nationals from safely re-
17
turning to Iraq. Many Iraqis with removal orders 
18
will face persecution, torture, or death if removed. 
19
They are therefore now eligible for immigration re-
20
lief that was unavailable when they were originally 
21
ordered removed. 
22
(3) The U.S. State Department currently warns 
23
against any travel to Iraq due to ‘‘terrorism, kidnap-
24
ping, and armed conflict’’.

(4) The most recent State Department report 
1
on human rights practices in Iraq warns of ‘‘unlaw-
2
ful or arbitrary killings by some members of the 
3
Iraq Security Forces (in this Act referred to as 
4
‘ISF’), particularly Iran-aligned elements of the 
5
Popular Mobilization Forces (in this Act referred to 
6
as ‘PMF’); forced disappearances; torture; arbitrary 
7
detention; harsh and life-threatening prison and de-
8
tention center conditions; arbitrary or unlawful in-
9
terference with privacy; restrictions on free expres-
10
sion, the press, and the internet, including censor-
11
ship, site blocking, and criminal libel; legal restric-
12
tions on freedom of movement of women; widespread 
13
official corruption; unlawful recruitment or use of 
14
child soldiers by Iran-aligned elements of the PMF 
15
that operate outside government control; trafficking 
16
in persons; criminalization of lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
17
transgender, and intersex (in this Act referred to as 
18
‘LGBTI’) status or conduct; violence targeting 
19
LGBTI persons; threats of violence against inter-
20
nally displaced persons (in this Act referred to as 
21
‘IDPs’) and returnee populations perceived to have 
22
been affiliated with ISIS; and restrictions on worker 
23
rights, including restrictions on formation of inde-
24
pendent unions and reports of child labor’’.

(5) Iraqis who are removed to Iraq are also at 
1
particular risk if they are perceived as American or 
2
affiliated with the United States, which is the case 
3
for the vast majority of Iraqis facing removal, since 
4
most have lived in the United States for many years. 
5
Iraqis who have family or employment ties in the 
6
United States face heightened risks within Iraq on 
7
the basis of their perceived loyalty to the United 
8
States. For more than a decade, groups hostile to 
9
the United States have persecuted and tortured ex-
10
tended family on account of a single family mem-
11
ber’s affiliation with the United States through em-
12
ployment or family ties. In 2007, Congress specifi-
13
cally created a refugee program for Iraqis affiliated 
14
with the United States because of the dangers facing 
15
Iraqis who have allied themselves with the United 
16
States. 
17
(6) Noncitizens previously ordered removed 
18
have a right to seek immigration relief based on cur-
19
rent country conditions. 
20
(7) In the summer of 2017, U.S. Immigration 
21
and Customs Enforcement sought to remove many 
22
Iraqi nationals, eventually detaining over 300. As a 
23
result of litigation, most of those detained Iraqis 
24
were able to seek immigration relief based on cur-
25

rent country conditions. Once they were able to ac-
1
cess the immigration court system, a large majority 
2
won motions to reopen their cases so that their eligi-
3
bility for relief can be determined based on current 
4
country conditions. While most of the cases remain 
5
in process, many of these Iraqis have won merits re-
6
lief, including withholding or deferral of removal 
7
under the Immigration and Nationality Act or Con-
8
vention Against Torture, asylum, reinstatement of 
9
their status as lawful permanent residents, and nat-
10
uralization. 
11
(8) There are an estimated 1,000 Iraqis who 
12
have not yet been able to seek immigration relief 
13
based on current country conditions. Due to the 
14
complexity of the required legal filings and the back-
15
logs in the immigration courts it can take several 
16
years for an individual to seek to reopen their immi-
17
gration case and have their eligibility for immigra-
18
tion relief decided on the merits. 
19
(9) Without sufficient time to seek immigration 
20
relief based on current country conditions, Iraqis 
21
could be removed to persecution, torture, or death 
22
before they receive an individualized adjudication of 
23
their eligibility for relief in light of current law and 
24
current facts.

(10) Deferring removals 24 months would allow 
1
Iraqis who have not yet done so time to seek immi-
2
gration relief based on changed country conditions.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
4
It is the sense of the Congress that— 
5
(1) Iraqis should not be deported if they face 
6
persecution, torture, or death; 
7
(2) because of changing country conditions in 
8
Iraq and the age of the Iraqis’ removal orders, it 
9
would be both unfair and dangerous to deport Iraqis 
10
without ensuring that their cases will be individually 
11
considered based on current country conditions; and 
12
(3) the removal of Iraq nationals described in 
13
section 4 should be deferred for a period of 24 
14
months, at the end of which Congress should have 
15
the opportunity to reevaluate country conditions in 
16
Iraq.
