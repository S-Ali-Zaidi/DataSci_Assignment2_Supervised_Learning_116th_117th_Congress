RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives with 
respect to the whistleblower complaint of August 12, 
2019, made to the Inspector General of the Intelligence 
Community. 
Whereas the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of 
the House of Representatives (in this resolution referred 
to as the ‘‘Committee’’) is charged with oversight of the 
intelligence community of the United States and all intel-
ligence-related activities and programs of the Federal 
Government; 
Whereas Federal statutes set forth a procedure for employ-
ees, assignees, detailees, and contractors of an element of

•HRES 576 IH 
the intelligence community to disclose classified informa-
tion related to ‘‘urgent concerns’’ to the Office of the In-
spector General of the Intelligence Community (in this 
resolution referred to as the ‘‘Inspector General’’) and to 
the congressional intelligence committees (as defined by 
section 3 of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 
U.S.C. 3003)) in a manner that protects whistleblowers 
from reprisal and threats of reprisal while also protecting 
the national security of the United States, including pur-
suant to section 103H(k)(5) of such Act (50 U.S.C. 
3033(k)(5)) and section 8H of the Inspector General Act 
of 1978 (5 U.S.C. App.); 
Whereas an ‘‘urgent concern’’ is defined by section 
103H(k)(5)(G)(i) of the National Security Act of 1947 
(50 U.S.C. 3033(k)(5)(G)(i)) to include ‘‘[a] serious or 
flagrant problem, abuse, violation of law or Executive 
order, or deficiency relating to the funding, administra-
tion, or operation of an intelligence activity within the re-
sponsibility and authority of the Director of National In-
telligence involving classified information, but does not 
include differences of opinions concerning public policy 
matters’’; 
Whereas since at least the establishment of the Inspector 
General in 2010, the Director of National Intelligence 
and the Inspector General have never withheld from the 
Committee a whistleblower complaint under section 
103H(k)(5) of the National Security Act of 1947, regard-
less of whether the complaint was determined to be cred-
ible or satisfy the definition of ‘‘urgent concern’’; 
Whereas, on August 12, 2019, the Inspector General received 
a complaint (in this resolution referred to as the ‘‘Com-
plaint’’) from an employee, assignee, detailee, or con-

tractor of an element of the intelligence community (in 
this resolution referred to as the ‘‘Whistleblower’’) re-
garding an ‘‘urgent concern’’ that the Whistleblower in-
tended to report to Congress; 
Whereas the independent Inspector General, within the 14- 
day period required by section 103H(k)(5)(B) of the Na-
tional Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3033(k)(5)(B)), 
conducted a preliminary review to determine whether the 
information alleged in the Complaint appeared credible 
and whether it met the statutory definition of an ‘‘urgent 
concern’’; 
Whereas the Inspector General concluded that the Complaint 
appeared credible and that it met the statutory definition 
of an ‘‘urgent concern’’; 
Whereas, on August 26, 2019, as required by section 
103H(k)(5)(B) of the National Security Act of 1947, the 
Inspector General transmitted the Complaint, accom-
panying materials, and the Inspector General’s deter-
mination that the Complaint was a credible urgent con-
cern, to the Acting Director of National Intelligence (in 
this resolution referred to as the ‘‘Acting Director’’); 
Whereas section 103H(k)(5)(C) of the National Security Act 
of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3033(k)(5)(C)) states unambiguously 
that the Director of National Intelligence ‘‘shall, within 
7 calendar days of such receipt, forward such transmittal 
to the congressional intelligence committees, together 
with any comments the Director considers appropriate’’; 
Whereas contrary to section 103H(k)(5)(C) of the National 
Security Act of 1947, the Acting Director, in consultation 
with the Department of Justice, which conducted its own 
fact-specific analysis, attempted to overrule the inde-

•HRES 576 IH 
pendent Inspector General’s determination and the law, 
claiming that the Complaint did not meet the statutory 
definition of an ‘‘urgent concern’’ because the Complaint 
did not ‘‘relate to the funding, administration or oper-
ation of an intelligence activity within the responsibility 
and supervision of the DNI’’ and that no statute—in-
cluding statutes governing whistleblowers—requires dis-
closure of the Complaint to the congressional intelligence 
committees; 
Whereas the Acting Director has breached his obligations 
under section 103H(k)(5)(C) of the National Security 
Act of 1947, and potentially other statutes, by refusing 
to transmit the Complaint to the congressional intel-
ligence committees by no later than September 2, 2019; 
Whereas the Inspector General, in explaining his disagree-
ment with the Acting Director to the congressional intel-
ligence committees, and his view as to why the Complaint 
readily met the definition of an ‘‘urgent concern’’, ob-
served that the Complaint ‘‘relates to one of the most sig-
nificant and important of the DNI’s responsibilities to 
the American people’’; 
Whereas the Trump Administration’s interpretation of sec-
tion 103H(k)(5) of the National Security Act of 1947 
represents a stark and unprecedented break with how 
whistleblower procedures have been interpreted in the 
past, raises serious and related questions about the appli-
cation of Federal laws relating to whistleblowers, and un-
dermines the Committee’s statutory oversight over ele-
ments of the intelligence community and intelligence-re-
lated activities and programs of the Federal Government; 
Whereas, on September 9, 2019, the Inspector General noti-
fied the Committee of the Complaint and the Acting Di-

•HRES 576 IH 
rector’s refusal to transmit the Complaint to the congres-
sional intelligence committees; 
Whereas, on September 13, 2019, in accordance with the 
Rules of Procedure of the Committee and the Rules of 
the House of Representatives for the 116th Congress, the 
Committee served a subpoena (in this resolution referred 
to as the ‘‘Subpoena’’) to the Acting Director to produce 
to the Committee the Complaint and accompanying mate-
rials, the Inspector General’s credibility determination, 
and any and all records related to the decision to with-
hold the Complaint from the Committee; 
Whereas the Acting Director, notwithstanding the Subpoena 
and in violation of a clear statutory command, continues 
to refuse to transmit the Complaint and the Inspector 
General’s determination to the Committee; 
Whereas notwithstanding a specific request from the Inspec-
tor General, the Acting Director has refused to provide 
direction to the Whistleblower, through the Inspector 
General, on how to contact the congressional intelligence 
committees directly ‘‘in accordance with appropriate secu-
rity practices’’ pursuant to clauses (i) and (ii) of section 
103H(k)(5)(D) of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 
U.S.C. 3033(k)(5)(D)(i) and (ii)); 
Whereas, as a direct result of the Acting Director’s violation 
of a clear and lawful statutory directive, the Committee 
is not fully and currently informed of alleged significant 
problems and deficiencies relating to programs and activi-
ties within the responsibility and authority of the Direc-
tor of National Intelligence, and the Committee is unable 
to exercise its constitutionally mandated oversight, inves-
tigative, and legislative responsibilities;

Whereas a Washington Post article on September 20, 2019, 
reported that the White House Counsel ‘‘has been en-
gaged in the matter since shortly after the whistleblower 
action surfaced . . . helping to identify legal obstacles to 
the sharing of information that could be politically dam-
aging to [President Donald J.] Trump’’; 
Whereas only days after the Director of National Intelligence 
assured Congress that the Whistleblower would be pro-
tected against ‘‘any retaliation or adverse consequence’’, 
President Donald J. Trump himself publicly has derided 
the Whistleblower as ‘‘a political hack job’’ and a ‘‘par-
tisan person’’ and questioned whether the Whistleblower 
is ‘‘on our Country’s side’’; and 
Whereas allegations of such unprecedented and highly inap-
propriate efforts by President Donald J. Trump, and 
White House and other senior officials of the Trump Ad-
ministration to— 
(1) discredit the Whistleblower and other lawful 
whistleblowers; 
(2) influence the Acting Director to violate a clear 
statutory command; and 
(3) not comply in full with the Subpoena, 
embody a serious breach of the obligation imposed by ar-
ticle II, section 3 of the Constitution of the United 
States on the President and the subordinates of the 
President to ‘‘take care that the Laws be faithfully exe-
cuted’’: Now, therefore, be it
