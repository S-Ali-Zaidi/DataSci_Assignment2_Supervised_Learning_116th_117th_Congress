‘‘(1) Each agency shall identify the problem 
1
that it intends to address (including, if applicable, 
2
the failures of private markets or public institutions 
3
that warrant new agency action) as well as assess 
4
the significance of that problem. 
5
‘‘(2) Each agency shall examine whether exist-
6
ing regulations (or other law) have created, or con-
7
tributed to, the problem that a new regulation is in-
8
tended to correct and whether those regulations (or

12
available alternatives to direct regulation, including 
13
providing economic incentives to encourage the de-
14
sired behavior, such as user fees or marketable per-
15
mits, or providing information upon which choices

can be made by the public.

18
is the best available method of achieving the regu-
19
latory objective, it shall design its regulations in the 
20
most cost-effective manner to achieve the regulatory 
21
objective. In doing so, each agency shall consider in-

and the benefits of the intended regulation and, rec-
4
ognizing that some costs and benefits are difficult to 
5
quantify, propose or adopt a regulation, unless ex-
6
pressly prohibited by law, only upon a reasoned de-

termination that the benefits of the intended regula-

best reasonably obtainable scientific, technical, eco-

nomic, and other information concerning the need

for, and consequences of, the intended regulation.

are inconsistent, incompatible, or duplicative with its
