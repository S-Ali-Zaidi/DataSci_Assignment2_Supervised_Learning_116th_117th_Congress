Government of the People’s Republic of China to respect 
the universally recognized human rights of all people

Whereas an estimated 1,000,000 people joined the protests in 
Tiananmen Square and citizens in over 400 Chinese cit-
ies staged similar protests calling for democratic reform, 
including not only students, but also government employ-
ees, journalists, workers, police officers, members of the 
armed forces, and other citizens; 
Whereas the peaceful demonstrations of 1989 called upon the 
Government of the People’s Republic of China to elimi-
nate corruption, accelerate economic and political reform, 
and protect human rights, particularly the freedoms of 
expression and assembly, issues that remain relevant in 
United States-China relations 30 years later; 
Whereas the Government of the People’s Republic of China 
takes active measures to deny its citizens the truth about 
the Tiananmen Square massacre, including the blocking 
of uncensored internet sites and social media commentary 
on microblog and other messaging services, and the 
placement of misleading information on the events of 
June 3 and 4, 1989, on internet sites available in China; 
Whereas, on May 20, 1989, martial law was declared in Bei-
jing, China, after authorities had failed to persuade dem-
onstrators to leave Tiananmen Square; 
Whereas during the late afternoon and early evening hours 
of June 3, 1989, thousands of armed troops, supported 
by tanks and other armor, moved into Beijing and sur-
rounding streets; 
Whereas, on the night of June 3, 1989, and continuing into 
the morning of June 4, 1989, soldiers fired into crowds, 
inflicting high casualties on the demonstrators and injur-
ing many unarmed civilians;

Whereas tanks crushed to death some protesters and onlook-
ers and seriously injured many others; 
Whereas independent observers reported that hundreds, per-
haps thousands, were killed and wounded by People’s 
Liberation Army soldiers and other security forces in 
Beijing and other cities in China; 
Whereas tens of thousands were detained and sent to prison 
or reeducation through labor, often without trial and 
many were tortured and imprisoned for decades; 
Whereas the Tiananmen Mothers is a group of relatives and 
friends of those killed in June 1989 whose demands in-
clude the right to mourn victims publicly and who call for 
a full, public, and independent accounting of the wound-
ed, dead, and those imprisoned for participating in the 
spring 1989 demonstrations; 
Whereas members of the Tiananmen Mothers group have 
faced arrest, harassment, and discrimination, with the 
group’s website blocked in China and the freezing by Chi-
nese authorities of international cash donations made to 
the group to support families of victims; 
Whereas despite the Government of the People’s Republic of 
China’s integration into the international economic sys-
tem and its obligations under international treaties and 
covenants, the political reforms and the protection of uni-
versally recognized rights sought by the Tiananmen dem-
onstrators have not been realized during the past 30 
years; 
Whereas the Government of the People’s Republic of China 
continues to actively suppress universally recognized 
rights by imprisoning or restricting the activities of pro- 
democracy activists, human rights lawyers, citizen jour-

of ethnic minorities, and individuals in the Xinjiang and 
Tibetan regions, among many others who seek to express 
their political or religious views or their ethnic identity in 
a peaceful manner, including in Hong Kong where the 
Government of the People’s Republic of China has in-
creasingly exerted influence, eroding freedoms there, and 
placing its special status at risk; 
Whereas the Government of the People’s Republic of China 
continues to harass, disappear, and detain peaceful advo-
cates for human rights, religious freedom, ethnic minority 
rights and the rule of law, and their family members, 
such as Ilham Tohti, Gao Zhisheng, Wang Bingzhang,

Whereas according to the Political Prisoner Database main-
tained by the United States Congressional-Executive 
Commission on China, the Government of the People’s 
Republic of China continues to detain over 1,500 political 
and religious prisoners, though the number is presumed 
to be much higher; 
Whereas Nobel Peace Prize laureate and prominent advocate 
for human rights and political reform Liu Xiaobo died in

Whereas over a million Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other ethnic 
and religious minorities are interned in political reeduca-

elsewhere in China and are subjected to the forced renun-
ciation of faith, torture, and forced assimilation of their 
language and culture through actions that may constitute 
crimes against humanity; 
Whereas the Government of the People’s Republic of China 
harasses, detains, and tortures human rights lawyers who 
take on cases deemed politically sensitive; prevents Chi-
nese workers from forming independent unions and en-
gages in an ongoing crackdown on labor advocates, orga-
nizations, and their supporters; restricts severely the reli-
gious activity of Protestants, Catholics, Tibetan Bud-
dhists, and Turkic Muslims and has sought to eradicate

fuses to negotiate with His Holiness the Dalai Lama or 
his representatives over Tibetan issues and asserts con-
trol over the reincarnation process through which the

refugees to North Korea and pressures neighboring gov-
ernments to repatriate refugees from China who reach 
their territory in contravention of the international legal 
principle of non-refoulement; restricts the activities of 
and detains citizen journalists; and continues to limit the 
size of Chinese families; 
Whereas the protection of universally recognized human

economic, political, and security relations with its neigh-
bors and the United States; and

Whereas the United States Congress annually observes the 
1989 Tiananmen demonstrations and their violent sup-
pression— 
(1) because of the enduring impact this historical 
episode has had on United States-China relations; 
(2) because there has been no justice for those who 
lost their lives seeking freedom and political reform dur-
ing the Spring of 1989; 
(3) because the Government of the People’s Republic 
of China censors research, discussion and commemora-
tion of Tiananmen in China; 
(4) because the demonstrations showed that the 
ideas of democracy and freedom, human rights and the 
rule of law are not foreign to the people of China; 
(5) because the demonstrations and their violent 
suppression showed the lengths to which the leaders of 
the Government of the People’s Republic of China will go 
to suppress universally recognized rights and to maintain 
their hold on power; and 
(6) because, despite persistent, ongoing, and some-
times brutal repression, there continue to be Chinese citi-
zens bravely seeking to exercise universally recognized 
human rights, ensure the rule of law, and promote polit-
ical reform thus carrying on the legacy of the Tiananmen 
demonstrations: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
