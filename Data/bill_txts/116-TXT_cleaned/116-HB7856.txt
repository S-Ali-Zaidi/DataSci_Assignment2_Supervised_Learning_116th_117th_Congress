11
the Armed Forces and the intelligence community, 
12
which are obligated to protect the rights of all the 
13
people of the United States;

(2) in a democracy, intelligence activities must 
15
not only be legitimate, they must also be perceived 
16
as legitimate; 
17
(3) intelligence support to domestic-focused ac-
18
tivities by the Armed Forces or Federal law enforce-
19
ment components involved in responding to protests, 
20
including to monitor, assess, or otherwise track 
21
Americans who are taking to the streets or otherwise 
22
engaging in constitutionally protected activity within

most extreme circumstances;

is ‘‘not precluded by applicable law’’, activities that

may be appropriate in the context of routine crimi-

in the context of law enforcement response to pro-

test or civil disturbances.

(a) FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.—

(1) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
12
(A) There is a strong bipartisan conviction, 
13
shared widely throughout the legislative and ex-
14
ecutive branches of the United States Govern-
15
ment and elsewhere, that ensuring full account-
16
ability for the brutal murder on October 2, 
17
2018, of Jamal Khashoggi, a former Wash-
18
ington Post columnist and resident of the 
19
United States, is in the public interest and also

the national interest of the United States.

ten report in ‘‘unclassified form’’ that includes 
3
‘‘identification of those who carried out, partici-
4
pated in, ordered, or were otherwise complicit in

or

for 
the

(C) Section 1277 of the National Defense 
8
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 (Public 
9
Law 116–92; 133 Stat. 1701) likewise obligated 
10
the Director to submit to the Committee on 
11

12

13

16
sessment of the intelligence community regard-
17
ing Mr. Khashoggi’s brutal murder. 
18
(D) Such section 1277 specifically called, 
19
among other things, for a determination and 
20
presentation of evidence with respect to the ad-
21
vance knowledge and role of any current or 
22

pering 
of 
evidence 
in 
relation 
to 
Mr. 
1
Khashoggi’s murder. 
2
(E) Such section 1277 also required the 
3
Director to submit a list of foreign persons 
4
whom the Director has high confidence were re-
5
sponsible for, complicit in, or otherwise know-
6
ingly and materially assisted the murder, or im-
7
peded its impartial investigation, or who or-
8
dered or otherwise directed an act or acts con-
9
tributing to or causing the murder. 
10
(F) Contrary to the unambiguous and law-
11
ful command of Congress under such sections 
12
5714 and 1277, the Director did not produce 
13
any unclassified report as required by either 
14
such section, and instead, on February 20, 
15
2020, the Director submitted to such commit-
16
tees a classified report, which the Director re-
17
ferred to as an ‘‘annex’’. 
18
(G) The evident belief of the Director that 
19
no unclassified information can be produced in 
20
accordance with the directives of Congress is 
21
dubious, in light of the extensive body of cred-
22
ible, unclassified reporting available regarding

5

6

7
telligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 2018, 
8

did not alter or obscure, in any way, the intelligence

13
quired, without putting sources and methods at risk.
