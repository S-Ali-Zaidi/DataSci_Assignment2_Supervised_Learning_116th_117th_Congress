A BILL 
To provide for the protection of the Boundary Waters Canoe 
Area Wilderness and interconnected Federal lands and 
waters, including Voyageurs National Park, within the 
Rainy River Watershed in the State of Minnesota, and 
for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 5598 IH
(1) The Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilder-
1
ness is a 1,090,000 acre Federal wilderness area, lo-
2
cated within the Superior National Forest, that was 
3
originally designated in the Wilderness Act of 1964 
4
(Public Law 88–577). 
5
(2) The Forest Service manages the Boundary 
6
Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, which includes— 
7
(A) nearly 2,000 pristine lakes ranging in 
8
size from 10 acres to 10,000 acres, and more 
9
than 1,200 miles of canoe routes; 
10
(B) 1,500 cultural resource sites including 
11
historic Ojibwe village sites and Native Amer-
12
ican pictograph panel sites; and 
13
(C) 150 miles of land and water on the 
14
international border with the Government of 
15
Canada. 
16
(3) In 1978, Congress passed the Boundary 
17
Waters Canoe Area Wilderness Act (Public Law 95– 
18
495) to remove incompatible uses, prohibit mining 
19
within the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness 
20
and on 220,000 acres of the Superior National For-
21
est, and to provide management guidance to protect, 
22
preserve, and enhance the lakes, waterways, and for-
23
ested areas of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area

Wilderness to enhance public enjoyment of the 
1
unique landscape and wildlife. 
2
(4) The federally recognized Grand Portage 
3
Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, the Fond du Lac 
4
Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, and the Bois 
5
Forte Band of Chippewa retain hunting, fishing, and 
6
other usufructuary rights throughout the entire 
7
northeast portion of Minnesota, including the 
8
Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, under the 
9
1854 Treaty of LaPointe. All Bands have a legal in-
10
terest in protecting natural resources and the Forest 
11
Service shares in the Federal trust responsibility to 
12
maintain treaty resources. 
13
(5) The Rainy River Watershed lies within the 
14
Superior National Forest, which contains 20 percent 
15
of the fresh water supply in the entire National For-
16
est System. 
17
(6) The Rainy River Watershed headwaters 
18
begin in northeastern Minnesota and flow north 
19
through the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilder-
20
ness and Voyageurs National Park and into Canada 
21
along the shared international border. These inter-
22
national waters are governed by the 1909 Boundary 
23
Waters Treaty, which states that ‘‘boundary waters 
24
and the waters flowing across the boundary shall not 
25

•HR 5598 IH
be polluted on either side to the injury of health or 
1
property on the other’’. 
2
(7) The waters of the Boundary Waters Canoe 
3
Area Wilderness and Voyageurs National Park are 
4
classified as Outstanding Resource Value Waters 
5
under Federal and State law, and degradation of 
6
water quality is prohibited. A risk of mining develop-
7
ment is acid mine drainage which generally occurs 
8
when sulfide minerals are exposed to air and water 
9
creating sulfuric acid, which decreases water pH and 
10
leaches harmful metals such as copper, zinc, lead, 
11
cadmium, iron, and nickel. 
12
(8) Acid mine runoff from sulfide-ore copper 
13
mining entering groundwater, rivers, streams, and 
14
lakes harms aquatic life, degrades water quality, and 
15
results in potential severe environmental impacts. 
16
(9) A peer-reviewed study of water quality im-
17
pacts from 14 operating United States copper sul-
18
fide mines found 100 percent of the mines experi-
19
enced pipeline spills or accidental releases: 13 mines 
20
experienced failures of water collection and treat-
21
ment systems to control contaminated mine seepage 
22
resulting in significant negative water quality im-
23
pacts.

(10) The mining of copper and other metals in 
1
sulfide bearing ore on Federal lands in the Superior 
2
National Forest, within the Rainy River Watershed, 
3
poses a direct and long-term threat from sulfide-ore 
4
mining contamination to the pristine water and air 
5
quality and healthy forested habitat of the Boundary 
6
Waters Canoe Area Wilderness and Voyageurs Na-
7
tional Park. 
8
(11) The likely contamination of the air, water, 
9
and forested habitat of the Boundary Waters Canoe 
10
Area Wilderness and Voyageurs National Park from 
11
the mining of copper, nickel, platinum, palladium, 
12
gold, and silver on Federal lands within the Rainy 
13
River Watershed puts at risk— 
14
(A) the nationally recognized natural re-
15
sources of the area; and 
16
(B) the region’s amenity-based and tour-
17
ism industry, which if protected by a mineral 
18
withdrawal, would grow by 1,500 to 4,600 more 
19
jobs and $100,000,000 to $900,000,000 more 
20
income over the next 20 years than if such min-
21
ing were not banned. 
22
(12) In 2016, the Forest Service issued a 
23
Record of Decision which found ‘‘unacceptable the 
24
inherent potential risk that development of a region-
25

ally-untested copper-nickel sulfide ore mine within 
1
the same watershed as the Boundary Waters Canoe 
2
Area Wilderness might cause serious and irreplace-
3
able harm to this unique, iconic, and irreplaceable 
4
wilderness area’’. The Forest Service subsequently 
5
proposed a 20-year mineral withdrawal of 234,328 
6
acres of Federal lands and waters in the Rainy 
7
River Watershed. 
8
(13) In 2018, approximately 20 months into a 
9
24-month review period of the Rainy River Water-
10
shed mineral withdrawal proposal, the Department 
11
of Agriculture abruptly abandoned the Environ-
12
mental Assessment. The Administration has subse-
13
quently refused multiple directives from Congress to 
14
complete and release the Environmental Assessment.
