SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) America’s overdose epidemic is spreading 
3
geographically, is increasing across all demographic 
4
groups and the sharp increase in drug overdose 
5
deaths in the United States between 2015 to 2016 
6
was fueled by a surge in illicit fentanyl, a highly po-
7
tent drug about 80 to 100 times as strong as mor-
8
phine by weight and is 30 to 40 times stronger than 
9
heroin by weight, as well as fentanyl-related com-
10
pound analogue overdoses. 
11
(2) Fentanyl began to appear on United States 
12
streets in the early 2000s, in recent years it has be-
13
come a major international drug control issue as 
14
overdose deaths from its abuse continue to rise, with 
15
a spike beginning in 2013. Foreign-sourced fentanyl 
16
killed more Americans in 2016 than all other illicit 
17
drugs, and synthetic opioids such as fentanyl and 
18
tramadol accounted for more than 29,000 United 
19
States drug overdose deaths in 2017, according to 
20
provisional data from the Centers for Disease Con-
21
trol and Prevention. Illicit fentanyl is not a diverged 
22
pharmaceutical product, is illicitly manufactured, 
23
and is clandestinely distributed and integrated into 
24
the illicit drug supply, usually sold as ‘‘heroin’’ in 
25

powder 
form, 
or 
as 
counterfeit 
opioid 
or 
1
benzodiazepine pills. 
2
(3) In Ocean County, New Jersey, based on 
3
data from the Ocean County Prosecutor’s Office, in 
4
2014, 10 percent of all overdose deaths had fentanyl 
5
in their systems, and by 2018 that number had risen 
6
to 80 percent. 
7
(4) The Drug Enforcement Administration re-
8
ports that of the illicit fentanyl class substances and 
9
hundreds of other designer drugs it has identified, 
10
‘‘the vast majority . . . are manufactured in 
11
China’’. In 2018, a year-long congressional probe 
12
found that illicit fentanyl could easily be bought on-
13
line from Chinese ‘‘labs’’ and mailed to the United 
14
States due to gaps in oversight in the United States 
15
Postal Service, and despite increased cooperation be-
16
tween United States and Chinese counter-narcotics 
17
agencies, illicit fentanyl is still shipped to the United 
18
States. 
19
(5) According to written testimony submitted to 
20
Congress by the RAND Corporation, regulatory ca-
21
pacity in China is inadequate to effectively police its 
22
expansive pharmaceutical and chemical industries, 
23
and according to the United States-China Economic 
24
and Security Review Commission, corrupt practices

among local officials limit the effectiveness of regula-
1
tions and allows criminal actors to facilitate the 
2
fentanyl trade. 
3
(6) In June 2018, $1,700,000 worth of Chinese 
4
fentanyl was detected by counternarcotics agents in 
5
a Philadelphia port during a routine inspection, 
6
China has publicly gone to great lengths to shirk re-
7
sponsibility for illicit fentanyl emanating out of the 
8
country, and in June 2018, Chinese official Liu 
9
Yuejin blamed the crisis on the American people, 
10
saying ‘‘When fewer and fewer Americans use 
11
fentanyl, there would be no market for it’’, ignoring 
12
the Chinese supply of the illicit substance, and 
13
China fails to effectively regulate precursor chemi-
14
cals, including fentanyl precursors. 
15
(7) According to Dr. Daniel Ciccarone’s street- 
16
based research, fentanyl lacks a lingo or slang, indi-
17
cating that this is more of a supply than a demand 
18
issue and its intentional use is far outweighed by 
19
non-intentional use. On September 6, 2018, at a 
20
hearing before the House Committee on Foreign Af-
21
fairs Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global 
22
Human Rights, and International Organizations, ex-
23
pert private witnesses from diverse professional and

academic backgrounds all concurred that China can 
1
do more to stem the flow of fentanyl. 
2
(8) According to the United Nations General 
3
Assembly, the drug trade poses a threat to ‘‘develop-
4
ment, peace and security and human rights’’, and 
5
the 
United 
Nations 
Convention 
against 
6
Transnational Organized Crime (the Palermo Con-
7
vention), a multilateral treaty against transnational 
8
organized crime including in the realm of narcotics 
9
signed and ratified by China which entered into 
10
force in 2003, obligates States Parties to ‘‘ensure ef-
11
fective action by its authorities in the prevention, de-
12
tection and punishment of the corruption of public 
13
officials’’. 
14
(9) Combating illicit fentanyl is a top priority 
15
of the Trump Administration and the President has 
16
called it ‘‘outrageous’’ that fentanyl comes from 
17
China. The Trump Administration has both high-
18
lighted China’s role in the crisis and targeted Chi-
19
nese manufacturers and traffickers, and at an Au-
20
gust 16, 2018, cabinet meeting, President Trump di-
21
rected then Attorney General Sessions to step up ef-
22
forts to stem inflows of fentanyl from China. 
23
(10) Statewide in New York, the number of 
24
fentanyl related deaths increased by nearly 160 per-
25

cent from 2015 to 2016. In April 2018, in Suffolk 
1
County, New York, Federal agents seized more than 
2
90 lbs of fentanyl and heroin with $10,000,000 
3
street value, the largest opioid bust in Suffolk Coun-
4
ty history to date. 
5
(11) At the 2018 G20 summit in Buenos Aires, 
6
China had agreed to tighten fentanyl controls. How-
7
ever, there has not yet been demonstratable and sus-
8
tained evidence of commitment.
