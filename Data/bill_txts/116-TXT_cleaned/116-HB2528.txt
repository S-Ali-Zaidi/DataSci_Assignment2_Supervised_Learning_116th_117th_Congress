(c) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds the following: 
3
(1) Many reports over the past decade have 
4
found that it is critical to our Nation’s economic 
5
leadership and global competitiveness that the 
6
United States educates and trains more scientists 
7
and engineers. 
8
(2) Research shows that women and minorities 
9
who are interested in STEM careers are dispropor-
10
tionately lost at nearly every educational transition. 
11
(3) The National Center for Science and Engi-
12
neering Statistics at the National Science Founda-
13
tion collects, compiles, and publishes data on the de-
14
mographics of STEM degrees and STEM jobs in the 
15
United States. 
16
(4) Women now earn nearly 37 percent of all 
17
STEM bachelor’s degrees, but major variations per-
18
sist among fields. In 2017, women earned only 20 
19

•HR 2528 IH
percent of all bachelor’s degrees awarded in engi-
1
neering and 19 percent of bachelor’s degrees award-
2
ed in computer sciences. Based on Bureau of Labor 
3
Statistics data, jobs in computing occupations are 
4
expected to account for nearly 60 percent of the pro-
5
jected annual growth of newly created STEM job 
6
openings from 2016 to 2026. 
7
(5) In 2017, underrepresented minority groups 
8
comprised 39 percent of the college-age population 
9
of the United States, but only 18 percent of stu-
10
dents who earned bachelor’s degrees in STEM fields. 
11
The Higher Education Research Institute at the 
12
University of California, Los Angeles, found that, 
13
while freshmen from underrepresented minority 
14
groups express an interest in pursuing a STEM un-
15
dergraduate degree at the same rate as all other 
16
freshmen, only 22.1 percent of Latino students, 18.4 
17
percent of African-American students, and 18.8 per-
18
cent of Native American students studying in STEM 
19
fields complete their degree within 5 years, com-
20
pared to approximately 33 percent of White students 
21
and 42 percent of Asian students who complete their 
22
degree within 5 years. 
23
(6) In some STEM fields, including the com-
24
puter sciences, women persist at about the same rate 
25
23:47 May 13, 2019
H2528

•HR 2528 IH
through doctorate degrees. In other STEM fields, 
1
women persist through doctorate degrees at a lower 
2
rate. In mathematics, women earn just 26 percent of 
3
doctorate degrees compared with 42 percent of un-
4
dergraduate degrees. Overall, women earned 38 per-
5
cent of STEM doctorate degrees in 2016. The rate 
6
of minority students earning STEM doctorate de-
7
grees in physics is 9 percent, compared with 15 per-
8
cent for bachelor’s degree. Students from underrep-
9
resented minority groups accounted for only 11.5 
10
percent of STEM doctorate degrees awarded in 
11
2016. 
12
(7) The representation of women in STEM 
13
drops significantly from the doctorate degree level to 
14
the faculty level. Overall, women hold only 26 per-
15
cent of all tenured and tenure-track positions and 27 
16
percent of full professor positions in STEM fields in 
17
our Nation’s universities and 4-year colleges. Black 
18
and Hispanic faculty together hold about 6.8 percent 
19
of all tenured and tenure-track positions and 7.5 
20
percent of full professor positions. Many of the num-
21
bers in the American Indian or Alaskan Native and 
22
Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander cat-
23
egories for different faculty ranks were too small for 
24
the National Science Foundation to report publicly 
25
23:47 May 13, 2019
H2528
5 
•HR 2528 IH
without potentially compromising confidential infor-
1
mation about the individuals being surveyed. 
2
(8) The representation of women is especially 
3
low at our Nation’s top research universities. Even 
4
in the biological sciences, in which women now earn 
5
more than 50 percent of the doctorates and passed 
6
the 25 percent level 37 years ago, women make up 
7
only 25 percent of the full professors at the approxi-
8
mately 100 most research-intensive universities in 
9
the United States. In the physical sciences and 
10
mathematics, women make up only 11 percent of full 
11
professors, in computer sciences only 10 percent, 
12
and across engineering fields only 7 percent. The 
13
data suggest that approximately 6 percent of all ten-
14
ure-track STEM faculty members at the most re-
15
search-intensive universities are from underrep-
16
resented minority groups, but in some fields the 
17
numbers are too small to report publicly. 
18
(9) By 2050, underrepresented minorities will 
19
comprise 52 percent of the college-age population of 
20
the United States. If the percentage of female stu-
21
dents and students from underrepresented minority 
22
groups earning bachelor’s degrees in STEM fields 
23
does not significantly increase, the United States 
24
will face an acute shortfall in the overall number of 
25
23:47 May 13, 2019
H2528
6 
•HR 2528 IH
students who earn degrees in STEM fields just as 
1
United States companies are increasingly seeking 
2
students with those skills. With this impending 
3
shortfall, the United States will almost certainly lose 
4
its competitive edge in the 21st century global econ-
5
omy. 
6
(10) According to a 2014 Association for 
7
Women in Science survey of over 4,000 scientists 
8
across the globe, 70 percent of whom were men, 
9
STEM researchers face significant challenges in 
10
work-life integration. Researchers in the United 
11
States were among the most likely to experience a 
12
conflict between work and their personal life at least 
13
weekly. One-third of researchers surveyed said that 
14
ensuring good work-life integration has negatively 
15
impacted their careers, and, of researchers intending 
16
to leave their current job within the next year, 9 
17
percent indicated it was because they were unable to 
18
balance work and life demands. 
19
(11) Female students and students from under-
20
represented minority groups at institutions of higher 
21
education who see few others ‘‘like themselves’’ 
22
among faculty and student populations often do not 
23
experience the social integration that is necessary for 
24
success in all disciplines, including STEM.

(12) One in five children in the United States 
1
attend school in a rural community. The data shows 
2
that rural students are at a disadvantage with re-
3
spect to STEM readiness. Among STEM-interested 
4
students, 17 percent of students in rural high 
5
schools and 18 percent of students in town-located 
6
high schools meet the ACT STEM Benchmark, com-
7
pared with 33 percent of students in suburban high 
8
schools and 27 percent of students in urban high 
9
schools. 
10
(13) A substantial body of evidence establishes 
11
that most people hold implicit biases. Decades of 
12
cognitive psychology research reveal that most peo-
13
ple carry prejudices of which they are unaware but 
14
that nonetheless play a large role in evaluations of 
15
people and their work. Unintentional biases and out-
16
moded institutional structures are hindering the ac-
17
cess and advancement of women, minorities, and 
18
other groups historically underrepresented in STEM. 
19
(14) Workshops held to educate faculty about 
20
unintentional biases have demonstrated success in 
21
raising awareness of such biases.

(A) is specifically designed to help NASA 
3

4
women in STEM fields continues and to ensure 
5
that it is not due to discrimination; and

(B) provides guidance that is usable by all 
7
institutions of higher education receiving sig-
8
nificant Federal research funding on how to 
9
conduct meaningful self-evaluations of campus 
10
culture and policies. 
11
(16) The Federal Government provides 55 per-
12
cent of research funding at institutions of higher 
13
education and, through its grant-making policies, 
14
has had significant influence on institution of higher 
15

after the date of enactment of this Act, the Director, 
12
in consultation with the interagency working group 
13
on inclusion in STEM, shall recommend a uniform 
14
policy for Federal science agencies to carry out a 
15
program of workshops that educate STEM depart-
16
ment chairs at institutions of higher education, sen-
17
ior managers at Federal laboratories, and other fed-
18
erally funded researchers about methods that mini-
19
mize the effects of implicit bias in the career ad-
20
vancement, including hiring, tenure, promotion, and 
21
selection for any honor based in part on the recipi-
22
ent’s research record, of academic and Federal 
23
STEM researchers.

9
PANTS.—In considering the participation of STEM 
10
department chairs and other academic researchers, 
11
the Director shall prioritize workshops for the broad 
12
fields of STEM in which the national rate of rep-
13
resentation of women among tenured or tenure-track 
14
faculty or nonfaculty researchers at doctorate-grant-
15
