SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

rights as human rights, including in connection with 
10
the 1994 International Conference on Population 
11
and Development, the 1995 Beijing World Con-
12
ference on Women, and through its ratification of 
13

session, states that under Article 6 of the ICCPR, 
1
State parties have a duty to ensure that all persons 
2
have the right to receive— 
3
(A) evidence-based information and edu-
4
cation about sexual and reproductive health, 
5
and access to a range of affordable contracep-
6
tive methods; 
7
(B) safe, legal, and effective access to 
8
abortion where the life and health of the preg-
9
nant woman or girl is at risk, or where carrying 
10
a pregnancy to term would cause the pregnant 
11
woman or girl substantial pain or suffering, no-
12
tably where pregnancy is the result of rape or 
13
incest or is not viable; and, access to quality 
14
prenatal and post-abortion health care; and 
15
(C) access by women and girls to safe 
16
abortion without the imposition of restrictions, 
17
which subject them to physical or mental pain 
18
or suffering, or which discriminate or arbi-
19
trarily interfere with their privacy, or place 
20
them at risk of undertaking unsafe abortions. 
21
(3) The Department of State’s deletion of the 
22
reproductive rights subsection from its 2017 Coun-
23
try Reports on Human Rights Practices dem-
24
onstrates an alarming level of politicization of

human rights by the Trump Administration and un-
1
dermines the human rights of women around the 
2
world. 
3
(4) When women’s reproductive rights are lim-
4
ited, so are their pathways to economic, social, and 
5
political empowerment. 
6
(5) Sexual health and reproductive rights are 
7
essential for sustainable economic development, are 
8
intrinsically linked to gender equality and women’s 
9
well-being, and are critical to maternal, newborn, 
10
child, adolescent, family, and community health.
