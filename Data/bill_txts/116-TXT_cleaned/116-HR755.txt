its impeachment against him for high crimes and mis-

demeanors.

ARTICLE I: ABUSE OF POWER 
3
The Constitution provides that the House of Rep-
4
resentatives ‘‘shall have the sole Power of Impeachment’’ 
5
and that the President ‘‘shall be removed from Office on 
6
Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or 
7
other high Crimes and Misdemeanors’’. In his conduct of 
8
the office of President of the United States—and in viola-
9
tion of his constitutional oath faithfully to execute the of-
10
fice of President of the United States and, to the best of 
11
his ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution 
12
of the United States, and in violation of his constitutional 
13
duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed— 
14
Donald J. Trump has abused the powers of the Presi-
15
dency, in that: 
16
Using the powers of his high office, President Trump 
17
solicited the interference of a foreign government, 
18
Ukraine, in the 2020 United States Presidential election. 
19
He did so through a scheme or course of conduct that 
20
included soliciting the Government of Ukraine to publicly 
21
announce investigations that would benefit his reelection, 
22
harm the election prospects of a political opponent, and 
23
influence the 2020 United States Presidential election to 
24
his advantage. President Trump also sought to pressure 
25
the Government of Ukraine to take these steps by condi-

•HRES 755 IH 
tioning official United States Government acts of signifi-
1
cant value to Ukraine on its public announcement of the 
2
investigations. President Trump engaged in this scheme 
3
or course of conduct for corrupt purposes in pursuit of 
4
personal political benefit. In so doing, President Trump 
5
used the powers of the Presidency in a manner that com-
6
promised the national security of the United States and 
7
undermined the integrity of the United States democratic 
8
process. He thus ignored and injured the interests of the 
9
Nation. 
10
President Trump engaged in this scheme or course 
11
of conduct through the following means: 
12
(1) President Trump—acting both directly and 
13
through his agents within and outside the United 
14
States Government—corruptly solicited the Govern-
15
ment of Ukraine to publicly announce investigations 
16
into— 
17
(A) a political opponent, former Vice Presi-
18
dent Joseph R. Biden, Jr.; and 
19
(B) a discredited theory promoted by Rus-
20
sia alleging that Ukraine—rather than Rus-
21
sia—interfered in the 2016 United States Pres-
22
idential election. 
23
(2) With the same corrupt motives, President 
24
Trump—acting both directly and through his agents 
25

•HRES 755 IH 
within and outside the United States Government— 
1
conditioned two official acts on the public announce-
2
ments that he had requested— 
3
(A) the release of $391 million of United 
4
States taxpayer funds that Congress had appro-
5
priated on a bipartisan basis for the purpose of 
6
providing vital military and security assistance 
7
to Ukraine to oppose Russian aggression and 
8
which President Trump had ordered suspended; 
9
and 
10
(B) a head of state meeting at the White 
11
House, which the President of Ukraine sought 
12
to demonstrate continued United States support 
13
for the Government of Ukraine in the face of 
14
Russian aggression. 
15
(3) Faced with the public revelation of his ac-
16
tions, President Trump ultimately released the mili-
17
tary and security assistance to the Government of 
18
Ukraine, but has persisted in openly and corruptly 
19
urging and soliciting Ukraine to undertake investiga-
20
tions for his personal political benefit. 
21
These actions were consistent with President 
22
Trump’s previous invitations of foreign interference in 
23
United States elections.

•HRES 755 IH 
In all of this, President Trump abused the powers 
1
of the Presidency by ignoring and injuring national secu-
2
rity and other vital national interests to obtain an im-
3
proper personal political benefit. He has also betrayed the 
4
Nation by abusing his high office to enlist a foreign power 
5
in corrupting democratic elections. 
6
Wherefore President Trump, by such conduct, has 
7
demonstrated that he will remain a threat to national se-
8
curity and the Constitution if allowed to remain in office, 
9
and has acted in a manner grossly incompatible with self- 
10
governance and the rule of law. President Trump thus 
11
warrants impeachment and trial, removal from office, and 
12
disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, 
13
trust, or profit under the United States.

ARTICLE II: OBSTRUCTION OF CONGRESS 
15
The Constitution provides that the House of Rep-
16
resentatives ‘‘shall have the sole Power of Impeachment’’ 
17
and that the President ‘‘shall be removed from Office on 
18
Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or 
19
other high Crimes and Misdemeanors’’. In his conduct of 
20
the office of President of the United States—and in viola-
21
tion of his constitutional oath faithfully to execute the of-
22
fice of President of the United States and, to the best of 
23
his ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution 
24
of the United States, and in violation of his constitutional 
25
duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed—

•HRES 755 IH 
Donald J. Trump has directed the unprecedented, categor-
1
ical, and indiscriminate defiance of subpoenas issued by 
2
the House of Representatives pursuant to its ‘‘sole Power 
3
of Impeachment’’. President Trump has abused the pow-
4
ers of the Presidency in a manner offensive to, and subver-
5
sive of, the Constitution, in that: 
6
The House of Representatives has engaged in an im-
7
peachment inquiry focused on President Trump’s corrupt 
8
solicitation of the Government of Ukraine to interfere in 
9
the 2020 United States Presidential election. As part of 
10
this impeachment inquiry, the Committees undertaking 
11
the investigation served subpoenas seeking documents and 
12
testimony deemed vital to the inquiry from various Execu-
13
tive Branch agencies and offices, and current and former 
14
officials. 
15
In response, without lawful cause or excuse, Presi-
16
dent Trump directed Executive Branch agencies, offices, 
17
and officials not to comply with those subpoenas. Presi-
18
dent Trump thus interposed the powers of the Presidency 
19
against the lawful subpoenas of the House of Representa-
20
tives, and assumed to himself functions and judgments 
21
necessary to the exercise of the ‘‘sole Power of Impeach-
22
ment’’ vested by the Constitution in the House of Rep-
23
resentatives.

President Trump abused the powers of his high office 
1
through the following means: 
2
(1) Directing the White House to defy a lawful 
3
subpoena by withholding the production of docu-
4
ments sought therein by the Committees. 
5
(2) Directing other Executive Branch agencies 
6
and offices to defy lawful subpoenas and withhold 
7
the production of documents and records from the 
8
Committees—in response to which the Department 
9
of State, Office of Management and Budget, Depart-
10
ment of Energy, and Department of Defense refused 
11
to produce a single document or record. 
12
(3) Directing current and former Executive 
13
Branch officials not to cooperate with the Commit-
14
tees—in response to which nine Administration offi-
15
cials defied subpoenas for testimony, namely John 
16
Michael ‘‘Mick’’ Mulvaney, Robert B. Blair, John A. 
17
Eisenberg, Michael Ellis, Preston Wells Griffith, 
18
Russell T. Vought, Michael Duffey, Brian McCor-
19
mack, and T. Ulrich Brechbuhl. 
20
These actions were consistent with President 
21
Trump’s previous efforts to undermine United States Gov-
22
ernment investigations into foreign interference in United 
23
States elections.

•HRES 755 IH 
Through these actions, President Trump sought to 
1
arrogate to himself the right to determine the propriety, 
2
scope, and nature of an impeachment inquiry into his own 
3
conduct, as well as the unilateral prerogative to deny any 
4
and all information to the House of Representatives in the 
5
exercise of its ‘‘sole Power of Impeachment’’. In the his-
6
tory of the Republic, no President has ever ordered the 
7
complete defiance of an impeachment inquiry or sought 
8
to obstruct and impede so comprehensively the ability of 
9
the House of Representatives to investigate ‘‘high Crimes 
10
and Misdemeanors’’. This abuse of office served to cover 
11
up the President’s own repeated misconduct and to seize 
12
and control the power of impeachment—and thus to nul-
13
lify a vital constitutional safeguard vested solely in the 
14
House of Representatives. 
15
In all of this, President Trump has acted in a manner 
16
contrary to his trust as President and subversive of con-
17
stitutional government, to the great prejudice of the cause 
18
of law and justice, and to the manifest injury of the people 
19
of the United States. 
20
Wherefore, President Trump, by such conduct, has 
21
demonstrated that he will remain a threat to the Constitu-
22
tion if allowed to remain in office, and has acted in a man-
23
ner grossly incompatible with self-governance and the rule 
24
of law. President Trump thus warrants impeachment and

trial, removal from office, and disqualification to hold and

enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United

States.
