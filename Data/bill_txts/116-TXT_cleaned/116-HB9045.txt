(a) LAWS AGAINST DISCRIMINATION.—An ambiguity 
2
in a statute that provides protection against discrimina-
3
tion on the basis of race, color, ethnicity, national origin, 
4
religion, disability, or sex (including gender, gender iden-
5
tity, and sexual orientation) shall be construed in the man-
6
ner that will provide the greatest protection against such 
7
discrimination. For purposes of this subsection, the Reli-
8
gious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (42 U.S.C. 
9
2000bb–1) is not a statute that provides protection 
10
against discrimination on the basis of religion.

(b) OTHER LAWS.—An ambiguity in a statute de-
12
signed to provide protection for freedom of speech or of 
13
the press, or for individual informational privacy, or for 
14
the environment, or for consumers, shall be construed in 
15
the manner that will provide the greatest protection for 
16
freedom of speech or of the press, or for individual infor-
17
mational privacy, for the environment, or for consumers, 
18
respectively. 
19
(c) CONSTITUTIONAL AVOIDANCE.—No statute de-
20
scribed in this section shall be construed so as to avoid 
21
a constitutional question if that construction differs from 
22
the construction required under this section. 
23
(d) LIBERAL CONSTRUCTION.—Nothing in this sec-
24
tion may be construed to prevent the liberal construction

4
sion of law, an individual may bring an action in the ap-

7
or regulation if the individual— 
8
(1) is within a class of individuals that the law 
9
or regulation was intended to or does benefit; and 
10
(2) was harmed by the violation of the law or 
11
regulation, 
12
regardless of whether the law or regulation provides such 
13
a private right of action, or provides other enforcement 
14
mechanisms. 
15
(b) EXCEPTION.—Subsection (a) does not apply in 
16
the case of a Federal law or regulation that explicitly pre-
17
cludes a private right of action.
