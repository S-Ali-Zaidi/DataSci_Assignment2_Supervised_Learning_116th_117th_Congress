achieved in the regular order of the appropriations proc-
ess; 
Whereas the Senate, on December 19, 2018, unanimously 
passed legislation to fund Government operations and

lation due to the President’s insistence that appropria-
tions for particular items be provided at his preferred lev-
els;

longest Government shutdown in the history of our coun-
try;

nificant financial hardships on those workers and their 
families;

tering of and, in some cases, damage to, countless na-
tional parks, monuments and other public lands;

ability to help communities rebuild after natural disas-
ters;

loughed, with negative consequences for public health and

sation in inspection and enforcement activities, and a 
stop to new chemical and pesticide safety evaluations and 
approvals;

partment of Agriculture loans, operating loan decisions,

sistance for farmers harmed by retaliatory tariffs im-

istration loans; 
Whereas the lapse in appropriations impeded the operations 
of United States embassies abroad, undermining the abil-

of the Department of Homeland Security to respond to 
increased cybersecurity threats, natural disasters, and 
terror threats;

ing the house they were attempting to buy or sell;

‘‘shutdowns represent the ultimate failure to govern and

come’’; and 
Whereas Senator Lamar Alexander said on January 24, 
2019, ‘‘it is always wrong for either side to use shutting 
down the Government as a bargaining chip in budget ne-
gotiations—it should be as off-limits as chemical weapons 
are to warfare’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-

(1) the shutdown of the Government of the

United States, or any portion thereof, causes sub-
4
stantial damage to Federal employees, to every

American who benefits directly or indirectly from 
6
Federal services, to our Nation’s economy, and to 
7
the reputation of the United States around the 
8
world; 
9
(2) shutting down the Government of the 
10
United States, or any portion thereof, is not an ac-
11
ceptable tactic or strategy for resolving differences 
12
regarding policy, funding levels, or governing philos-
13
ophy; and

(3) in the future the Congress must ensure the
