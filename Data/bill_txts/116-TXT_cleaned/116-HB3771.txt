A BILL 
To establish an interagency One Health Program, and for 
other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Advancing Emergency 
4
Preparedness Through One Health Act of 2019’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) The term ‘‘One Health’’ reflects the inter-
8
connectedness of human health, animal health, and

the environment. As technology and population 
1
growth facilitates increased interaction of human 
2
settlements with wildlife habitats and as inter-
3
national travel and trade increases, the interface be-
4
tween these elements will also continue to rise. 
5
(2) When zoonotic diseases spillover to humans, 
6
there are often enormous health and economic costs. 
7
The World Bank estimates that, between 1997 and 
8
2009, the global costs from six zoonotic outbreaks 
9
exceeded $80,000,000,000 and the Centers for Dis-
10
ease Control and Prevention estimates that there are 
11
annually 2,500,000,000 cases of zoonotic infections 
12
globally, resulting in 2,700,000 deaths. 
13
(3) There are also immense effects on the agri-
14
culture sector. In 2014 and 2015, a high pathogenic 
15
avian influenza (HPAI) outbreak in the United 
16
States led to the cull of nearly 50,000,000 birds, 
17
and imposed up to approximately $3,300,000,000 in 
18
losses for poultry and egg farmers, animal feed pro-
19
ducers, baked good production, and other related in-
20
dustries. 
21
(4) Public health preparedness depends on agri-
22
culture in a variety of ways. For example, a wide 
23
range of vaccines, including those for influenza, yel-
24
low 
fever, 
rabies, 
and 
measles-mumps-rubella

(MMR), are primarily cultivated in poultry eggs. 
1
Egg shortages resulting from zoonotic disease out-
2
breaks could impose serious risks to vaccine manu-
3
facturing efforts. 
4
(5) It is estimated that approximately 80 per-
5
cent of potential pathogens likely to be used in bio-
6
terrorism or biowarfare are common zoonotic patho-
7
gens. 
8
(6) While existing Federal Government initia-
9
tives related to One Health span multiple agencies, 
10
including the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
11
vention One Health office and the Department of 
12
Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection 
13
Services’ One Health Coordination Center, addi-
14
tional interagency coordination is necessary to help 
15
better prevent, prepare for, and respond to zoonotic 
16
disease outbreaks.
