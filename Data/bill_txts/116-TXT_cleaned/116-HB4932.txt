3
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
4
(1) The use of technology in health care and 
5
coverage of telehealth services are rapidly evolving. 
6
(2) Research has found that telehealth services 
7
can expand access to care, improve the quality of 
8
care, and reduce spending, and that patients receiv-
9
ing telehealth services are satisfied with their experi-
10
ences. 
11
(3) Health care workforce shortages are a sig-
12
nificant problem in many areas and for many types 
13
of health care clinicians. 
14
(4) Telehealth increases access to care in areas 
15
with workforce shortages and for individuals who 
16

•HR 4932 IH
live far away from health care facilities, have limited 
1
mobility or transportation, or have other barriers to 
2
accessing care. 
3
(5) The use of health technologies can strength-
4
en the expertise of the health care workforce, includ-
5
ing by connecting clinicians to specialty consulta-
6
tions. 
7
(6) Utilization of telehealth services in Medicare 
8
remains low, with only 0.25 percent of Medicare fee- 
9
for-service beneficiaries utilizing telehealth services 
10
in 2016. 
11
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
12
gress that— 
13
(1) health care providers can furnish safe, effec-
14
tive, and high-quality health care services through 
15
telehealth; and 
16
(2) barriers to the use of telehealth should be 
17
removed.
