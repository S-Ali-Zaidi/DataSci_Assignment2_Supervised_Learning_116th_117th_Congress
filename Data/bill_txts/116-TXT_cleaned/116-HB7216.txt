SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) On January 21, 2020, the United States 
3
confirmed the Nation’s first case of the 2019 novel 
4
coronavirus, which presents as the disease COVID– 
5
19. 
6
(2) On March 11, 2020, the World Health Or-
7
ganization upgraded the COVID–19 outbreak from 
8
global health emergency status to a pandemic. 
9
(3) On March 15, 2020, the Centers for Dis-
10
ease Control and Prevention recommended a restric-
11
tion on gatherings of 50 or more people in the 
12
United States. 
13
(4) Beginning in mid-March, the administration 
14
issued new guidelines on the pandemic and called for 
15
nationwide social distancing, among other pre-
16
cautions, to slow the spread of COVID–19. 
17
(5) On March 17, 2020, Dr. Anthony Fauci, in 
18
his capacity as Director of the National Institute of 
19
Allergy and Infectious Diseases, explained that ‘‘so-
20
cial distancing is really physical separation of people, 
21
wherein circumstances where there are crowds, you 
22
remove yourself from very close contact.’’ 
23
(6) Most Governors executed orders in States 
24
across the country to close or restrict operations of 
25
business across various industries on a temporary

basis, in an effort to promote social distancing, sty-
1
mie the rapid spread of the coronavirus, and flatten 
2
the curve so as not to overwhelm the Nation’s health 
3
care system’s capacity. 
4
(7) Those closures or operating limitations have 
5
caused significant strain on America’s small busi-
6
nesses in the interest of public health. 
7
(8) Small businesses are the engine of the 
8
United States economy, comprising 99 percent of all 
9
business ventures in the United States and account-
10
ing for half of the United States economy. 
11
(9) In order to safely resume full operations, 
12
these small businesses need access to personal pro-
13
tective equipment; in some cases, States are requir-
14
ing employers and employees use this personal pro-
15
tective equipment in order to allow public entry. 
16
(10) Due to the fiscal strain of pandemic-re-
17
lated losses on these small businesses, they cannot 
18
and should not bear the financial burden of acquir-
19
ing personal protective equipment without relief. 
20
(11) Providing relief through a tax credit for 
21
the purchase and use of personal protective equip-
22
ment will directly support small businesses returning 
23
to and exceeding pre-COVID-19 pandemic produc-
24
tion levels.

1
May 28, 2020, Mr. Charles ‘‘Tee’’ Rowe, President 
2
and Chief Executive Officer of America’s SBDC, 
3
testified to the potential value of such credits. 
4
(13) Personal protective equipment tax credits 
5
will be instrumental in safely and responsibly re-
6
starting the engine of the United States economy.
