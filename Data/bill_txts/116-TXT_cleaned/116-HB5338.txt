•HR 5338 IH
(1) Cancer is a leading cause of death for chil-
1
dren and adolescents around the world, and approxi-
2
mately 300,000 children aged 0 to 19 years old are 
3
diagnosed with cancer each year. 
4
(2) The most common categories of childhood 
5
cancers include leukemia, brain cancer, lymphoma, 
6
and solid tumors, such as neuroblastoma and Wilms 
7
tumor. 
8
(3) Most childhood cancers can be cured with 
9
generic medicines and can be cost-effective for all in-
10
come levels. 
11
(4) In the United States, the survival rate for 
12
children diagnosed with cancer is over 80 percent. In 
13
many developing countries, the mortality rate of 
14
children diagnosed with cancer is around 80 percent. 
15
In some parts of Africa, the mortality rate reaches 
16
90 percent. 
17
(5) In September 2018, the World Health Or-
18
ganization announced a new effort—the Global Ini-
19
tiative for Childhood Cancer—with the aim of reach-
20
ing at least a 60-percent survival rate for children 
21
with cancer by 2030, thereby saving an additional 
22
1,000,000 lives.

the goals of the World Health Organization Initia-
10
tive for Childhood Cancer, helping increase survival
