RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the designation of September 2019 
as Campus Fire Safety Month. 
Whereas student-related housing fires in Texas, Oregon, Illi-
nois, Washington, DC, Pennsylvania, and other schools 
across the country have tragically cut short the lives of 
some of the youth of the Nation; 
Whereas, since January 2000, at least 175 people, including 
students, parents, and children have died in college-re-
lated fires; 
Whereas approximately 87 percent of these deaths have oc-
curred in off-campus occupancies; 
Whereas a majority of the students across the Nation live in 
off-campus occupancies;

Whereas a number of fatal fires have occurred in buildings 
where the fire safety systems have been compromised or 
disabled by the occupants; 
Whereas it is recognized that automatic fire alarm systems 
and smoke alarms provide the necessary early warning to 
occupants and the fire department of a fire so that ap-
propriate action can be taken; 
Whereas it is recognized that automatic fire sprinkler systems 
are a highly effective method of controlling or extin-
guishing a fire in its early stages, protecting the lives of 
the building’s occupants; 
Whereas many students are living in off-campus occupancies, 
Greek housing, and residence halls that are not ade-
quately protected with automatic fire sprinkler systems 
and automatic fire alarm systems or adequate smoke 
alarms; 
Whereas it is recognized that fire safety education is an effec-
tive method of reducing the occurrence of fires and re-
ducing the resulting loss of life and property damage; 
Whereas students are not routinely receiving effective fire 
safety education throughout their entire college career; 
Whereas it is vital to educate the future generation of the 
Nation about the importance of fire safety behavior so 
that these behaviors can help to ensure their safety dur-
ing their college years and beyond; and 
Whereas by developing a generation of fire-safe adults, future 
loss of life from fires can be significantly reduced: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
