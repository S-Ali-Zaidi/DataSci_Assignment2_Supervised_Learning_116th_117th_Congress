A BILL 
To declare a national goal that the United States achieve 
a 100 percent clean economy by not later than 2050, 
and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘100% Clean Economy 
4
Act of 2019’’. 
5
SEC. 2. NATIONAL GOAL. 
6
It is hereby declared that it is the national goal for 
7
the United States to achieve a 100 percent clean economy 
8
by not later than 2050.

SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
10
Congress makes the following findings: 
11
(1) In 2018, the United Nations Intergovern-
12
mental Panel on Climate Change released a report 
13
which projected that the global mean surface tem-
14
perature of the Earth could rise 1.5 °C above 
15
03:08 Dec 04, 2019

•HR 5221 IH
preindustrial levels as early as 2030. Increases be-
1
yond this threshold would likely have devastating ef-
2
fects on our society. 
3
(2) The 2018 report indicates that to prevent 
4
1.5 °C of warming above preindustrial levels, emis-
5
sions from human sources must be reduced by 40 to 
6
60 percent from 2010 levels by 2030, and to net 
7
zero emissions by 2050. 
8
(3) The Federal Government can and must play 
9
a leading role in global efforts to minimize climate 
10
change and to mitigate its worst effects. By achiev-
11
ing a 100 percent clean economy by 2050, the 
12
United States can take a critical step toward meet-
13
ing that obligation. 
14
(4) Greenhouse gas pollution, like many other 
15
forms of pollution, adversely affects human beings 
16
on both local and global scales. These effects are 
17
intersectional and accretive, and the cumulative im-
18
pact of past and present pollution has fallen dis-
19
proportionately 
upon 
already-vulnerable 
and 
20
-marginalized communities, including communities of 
21
color, Tribal and indigenous communities, low-in-
22
come communities, and rural communities. Current 
23
and future effects of climate change, including ad-
24
verse health effects and other harms, are being and 
25
03:08 Dec 04, 2019
H5221
4 
•HR 5221 IH
will likely continue to be felt first and most severely 
1
in many of these same vulnerable communities. 
2
(5) Governmental action to correct environ-
3
mental injustice is morally imperative and necessary 
4
for public health. Federal policy can and should ac-
5
knowledge, and make use of, the intersections be-
6
tween the interlinked challenges of correcting envi-
7
ronmental injustice and reducing greenhouse gas 
8
pollution. 
9
(6) At the same time, American workers and 
10
communities are also suffering from economic in-
11
equality and wages are not keeping up with the cost 
12
of living for healthcare and other necessities. The 
13
trend downward in union representation and the 
14
bargaining power that provides for workers has cor-
15
responded with an increase in income going to the 
16
top 10 percent of earners. Federal climate policy can 
17
and should be shaped to diminish economic inequal-
18
ity and expand the rights of workers. 
19
(7) All people deserve clean air, clean water, a 
20
life free from toxic pollution that endanger public 
21
health or welfare, and to share in the benefits of a 
22
100 percent clean economy. 
23
(8) Sound climate policies to achieve a 100 per-
24
cent clean economy will spur the development and 
25
03:08 Dec 04, 2019
H5221
5 
•HR 5221 IH
manufacturing of new technologies, the construction 
1
and repair of infrastructure, the restoration of nat-
2
ural systems for resilience and carbon sequestration, 
3
and the creation of new high-quality jobs. These in-
4
vestments can help ensure the competitiveness of the 
5
United States in the global economy. 
6
(9) As the Federal Government seeks to combat 
7
climate change, these new resources and opportuni-
8
ties should be concentrated, as quickly as possible 
9
and to the greatest extent practicable, in commu-
10
nities that are currently experiencing or potentially 
11
face disproportionate harm from pollution, and that 
12
face greater challenges in the transition to a 100 
13
percent clean economy.
