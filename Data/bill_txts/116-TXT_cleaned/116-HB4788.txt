A BILL 
To address the needs of workers in industries likely to be 
impacted by rapidly evolving technologies. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Investing in Tomor-

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress makes the following findings: 
7
(1) In 2014, the United States spent just 0.1 
8
percent of the Nation’s Gross Domestic Product on 
9
labor market policies, less than half of what the 
10

H4788
2 
•HR 4788 IH
United States spent on labor market policies 30 
1
years ago. 
2
(2) The number of workers receiving federally 
3
supported training has declined in the past 3 dec-
4
ades as advances in technology have simultaneously 
5
shifted labor market demand over time. 
6
(3) As much as 47 percent of all jobs in the 
7
United States are at risk of being replaced by auto-
8
mation technology, and job losses from automation 
9
are more likely to impact workers making less than 
10
$40,000 annually. 
11
(4) Strong Federal investment in expanding 
12
training services for workers whose jobs may be lost 
13
due to automation could prepare the United States 
14
workforce to better adapt to changes in the labor 
15
market and enter into skilled positions in techno-
16
logically oriented occupations and industries. 
17
(5) A focus on preparing the workforce of the 
18
United States for jobs that utilize advanced tech-
19
nologies could grow wages, increase economic pro-
20
ductivity, and boost the competitiveness of the 
21
United States.
