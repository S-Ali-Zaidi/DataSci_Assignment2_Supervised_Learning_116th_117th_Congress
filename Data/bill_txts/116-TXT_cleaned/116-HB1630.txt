SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
7
Congress makes the following findings: 
8
(1) The Department of State’s 2018 Inter-
9
national Narcotics Control Strategy Report stated 
10
that, in Guatemala, ‘‘widespread corruption per-
11
meates public and private institutions and exacer-
12
bates the country’s security, governmental, and eco-
13
nomic challenges’’. 
14
(2) The same report, discussing money laun-
15
dering in Guatemala, noted that ‘‘[d]rug trafficking 
16
is a major source of illicit funds. Other sources in-
17
clude corruption, extortion, human trafficking, com-
18
merce of other illicit goods, and tax evasion. Money 
19
is laundered primarily through real estate, ranching, 
20
and the gaming industry. It is also laundered 
21
through a series of small transactions below the U.S. 
22
$10,000 reporting requirement, either in small 
23
banks along the Guatemala-Mexico border, or by 
24
travelers carrying cash to other countries’’.

(3) On August 10, 2018, Guatemala’s Attorney 
1
General filed a request before the Supreme Court of 
2
Guatemala to remove the immunity of Guatemala’s 
3
President, Jimmy Morales, so that he could be 
4
charged for the crime of illicit election financing, 
5
based on investigations carried out jointly by the Of-
6
fice of the Attorney General and the International 
7
Commission 
against 
Impunity 
in 
Guatemala 
8
(CICIG). 
9
(4) In August 2018, the Guatemalan Supreme 
10
Court ruled that there was sufficient evidence for 
11
the Guatemalan Congress to decide if President Mo-
12
rales should be investigated for illicit election financ-
13
ing. 
14
(5) On January 7, 2019, the Government of 
15
Guatemala announced that it was terminating the 
16
agreement establishing CICIG effective immediately. 
17
(6) The United Nations responded that the Sec-
18
retary-General ‘‘strongly rejects’’ the announcement, 
19
stating ‘‘The mandate of the Commission is set to 
20
end on 3 September 2019. Until that date, we ex-
21
pect the Government of Guatemala to entirely fulfill 
22
its legal obligations under the Agreement. The Sec-
23
retary-General expects the Government of Guate-
24
mala to abide by its international undertakings to
