Whereas, in 1838, music as its own curriculum was first 
adopted by public authority in the public schools of Bos-
ton, Massachusetts; 
Whereas the development of a musical people has been and 
remains dependent on a public commitment to the teach-
ing of music in all schools; 
Whereas State legislatures and educational agencies have 
supported music as part of the regular school curriculum; 
Whereas the Every Student Succeeds Act identified music as 
part of a well-rounded education; 
Whereas music is a means for exploring the emotional and 
aesthetic dimensions of the human experience; 
Whereas music holds intrinsic value as an art form, providing 
opportunity for self-expression, fellowship, and spiritual 
fulfillment; 
Whereas research has documented that participation in school 
music promotes student engagement, leading to improved 
social and academic outcomes, particularly for at-risk 
students; 
Whereas research has documented that participation in school 
music also promotes cognitive, social, and emotional de-
velopment, exercising skills valuable to the workforce 
such as motivation, attentiveness, self-discipline, team-
work, persistence, empathy, respect, and leadership; and 
Whereas racial minorities and students who are of low-socio-
economic backgrounds are less likely to have access to a 
high-quality music education: Now, therefore, be it
