CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the honorable service of military working dogs 
and soldier handlers in the tactical explosive detection 
dog program of the Army and encouraging the Army 
and other government agencies, including law enforce-
ment agencies, with former tactical explosive detection 
dogs to prioritize adoption of the dogs to former tactical 
explosive detection dog handlers. 
Whereas the 341st Training Squadron, 37th Training Wing 
at Lackland Air Force Base provides highly trained mili-
tary working dogs to the Department of Defense and 
other government agencies;

Whereas in 2010, the operational needs of the Army for mili-
tary working dogs increased without an increase in re-
sources to train a sufficient number of dogs for the detec-
tion of improvised explosive devices at the 341st Training 
Squadron; 
Whereas the Army initiated the tactical explosive detection 
dog program in August 2010 as a nontraditional military 
working dog program to train and field improvised explo-
sive device detection dogs for use in Afghanistan as part 
of Operation Enduring Freedom; 
Whereas the tactical explosive detection dog program was cre-
ated to reduce casualties from improvised explosive de-
vices in response to an increase in the use of asymmetric 
weapons by the enemy; 
Whereas the tactical explosive detection dogs were a unique 
subset of military working dogs because the Army se-
lected and trained soldiers from deploying units to serve 
as temporary handlers for only the duration of deploy-
ment to Operation Enduring Freedom; 
Whereas the tactical explosive detection dogs and their soldier 
handlers, like other military working dog and handler 
teams, formed strong bonds while training for combat 
and performing extremely dangerous improvised explosive 
device detection missions in service to the United States; 
Whereas the tactical explosive detection dog program was a 
nontraditional military working dog program that termi-
nated in February 2014; 
Whereas at the termination of the tactical explosive detection 
dog program in February 2014, neither United States 
law nor Department of Defense policy established an 
adoption order priority, and Department of Defense pol-

icy only provided that military working dogs be adopted 
by former handlers, law enforcement agencies, and other 
persons capable of humanely caring for the animals; 
Whereas an August 2016 report to Congress by the Air 
Force entitled ‘‘Tactical Explosive Detector Dog (TEDD) 
Adoption Report’’ concluded that the Army had a limited 
transition window for the disposition of tactical explosive 
detection dogs and the lack of a formal comprehensive 
plan contributed to the disorganized disposition process 
for the tactical explosive detection dogs; 
Whereas the August 2016 report stated that, in 2014, the 
Army disposed of 229 tactical explosive detection dogs; 
Whereas 40 tactical explosive detection dogs were adopted by 
handlers, 47 dogs were adopted by private individuals, 70 
dogs were transferred to Army units, 17 dogs were trans-
ferred to other government agencies, 46 dogs were trans-
ferred to law enforcement agencies, and 9 dogs were de-
ceased; 
Whereas the disposition of tactical explosive detection dogs 
was poorly executed, proper procedures outlined in De-
partment of Defense policy were ignored, and, as a re-
sult, the former soldier handlers were not provided the 
opportunity to adopt their tactical explosive detection 
dogs; 
Whereas the Army should have deliberately planned for the 
disposition of the tactical explosive detection dogs and 
provided appropriate time to review and consider adop-
tion applications to mitigate handler and civilian adoption 
issues; 
Whereas section 342(b) of the National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act for Fiscal Year 2016 (Public Law 114–92; 129

Stat. 793) amended section 2583(c) of title 10, United 
States Code, to modify the list of persons authorized to 
adopt a military animal and prioritize the list with pref-
erence, respectively, to former handlers, other persons ca-
pable of humanely caring for the animal, and law en-
forcement agencies; 
Whereas since 2000, Congress has passed legislation that 
protects military working dogs, promotes their welfare, 
and recognizes the needs of their veteran handlers; 
Whereas Congress continues to provide oversight of military 
working dogs to prevent a reoccurrence of the disposition 
issues that affected tactical explosive detection dogs; 
Whereas former soldier handlers should be reunited with 
their tactical explosive detection dogs; 
Whereas congressional recognition of the military service of 
tactical explosive detection dogs and their former soldier 
handlers is a small measure of gratitude this legislative 
body can convey; 
Whereas over 4 years have passed since the termination of 
the tactical explosive detection dog program; 
Whereas Congressman Walter B. Jones has been a long-time 
advocate for military working dogs and their handlers; 
Whereas Congressman Walter B. Jones has worked to ensure 
that handlers are given priority when their military work-
ing dogs reach retirement; 
Whereas Congressman Walter B. Jones was a strong pro-
ponent of the Wounded Warrior Service Dog program, 
which is a valuable program that helps wounded members 
of the Armed Forces manage and recover from post-trau-
matic stress;

Whereas the advocacy of Congressman Walter B. Jones for 
military working dogs is well known throughout the non-
profit community that supports military working dogs; 
Whereas Congressman Walter B. Jones worked with the De-
partment of Defense and the Senate to update the lan-
guage in the Air Force Manual on Military Working 
Dogs to clarify that military working dogs are not equip-
ment and to indicates the true level of appreciation and 
respect the Department of Defense has for these valuable 
members of the military team; 
Whereas Congressman Walter B. Jones was the chief legisla-
tive sponsor of the Military Working Dog Teams Monu-
ment, which was built with no taxpayer dollars but 
through corporate and private donations; and 
Whereas with the support of Congressman Walter B. Jones, 
the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 
2008 (Public Law 110–181) authorized the Burnam 
Foundation to design, fund, build, and maintain the Mili-
tary Working Dog Teams National Monument: Now, 
therefore, be it—
