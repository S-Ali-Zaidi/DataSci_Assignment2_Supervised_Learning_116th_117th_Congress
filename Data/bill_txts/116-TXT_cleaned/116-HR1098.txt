Whereas, as part of DEFENDER-EUROPE 2020, United 
States civilian and military ships coordinated their move-
ments across the Atlantic Ocean, validating their ability 
to move thousands of troops and equipment through con-
tested waters during opposed transit convoy operations; 
Whereas, additionally, the Army leveraged the use of its 
Prepositioned Stocks located in Europe that were de-
ployed 
to 
exercise 
sites 
throughout 
Europe 
for 
sustainment; 
Whereas, through this elaborate coordination, the United 
States military validated its ability to rapidly deploy and 
sustain massive military capability to deter adversaries 
from conducting destabilizing hostilities against demo-
cratic institutions; 
Whereas NATO Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Eu-
rope (SHAPE) planned the training and logistics for 
37,000 troops across 18 NATO countries that would par-
ticipate in 6 complex exercises to demonstrate NATO’s 
ability to deter aggression while protecting peace 
throughout Europe, enhance relationships, readiness, and 
interoperability among NATO allies, and achieve the ob-
jectives of the United States National Defense Strategy 
and strategic objectives of NATO; 
Whereas United States commanders and partner countries 
quickly adapted exercise plans to the COVID–19 crisis in 
Europe by adjusting troop movements and activities to 
protect the force and its readiness from a highly infec-
tious pandemic; 
Whereas, by leveraging existing NATO institutions and 
agreements, NATO forces completed, on short notice, 
more than 350 flights to transport over 1,000 tons of

medical supplies, established in excess of 100 field hos-
pitals containing more than 25,000 medical beds, and 
supported civilian medical and security efforts to respond 
to a global health emergency; 
Whereas, despite the COVID–19 pandemic, military leaders 
were able to safely proceed with DEFENDER-EUROPE 
2020 training objectives during two coordinated phases; 
Whereas, starting with Allied Spirit, the first phase, United 
States and Polish forces completed a Division-size wet 
gap crossing of 6,000 troops and 100 vehicles over sev-
eral hundred feet of river, and the exercise was also able 
to test casualty evacuation capabilities over arduous ter-
rain, validating United States and Polish forces inter-
operability in deploying rapidly together; and 
Whereas, during the second phase of DEFENDER-EU-
ROPE 2020, in the Emergency Deployment Readiness 
Exercise, the United States Army validated its ability to 
surge and rapidly redeploy combat vehicles and over 500 
troops to Poland under the Department of Defense’s Dy-
namic Force Employment concept, and these flexes in 
operational plans ensured that military forces could adapt 
logistical and protective requirements vital in sustaining 
the force during an emergent threat: Now, therefore, be 
it
