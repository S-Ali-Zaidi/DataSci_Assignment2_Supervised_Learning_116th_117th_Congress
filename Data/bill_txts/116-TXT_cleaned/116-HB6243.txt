money laundering concern and imposed restrictions 
1
on correspondent accounts in the United States in-
2
volving Iranian financial institutions. 
3
(2) In June 2019, the Financial Action Task 
4
Force (‘‘FATF’’) urged all jurisdictions to require 
5
increased supervisory examination for branches and 
6
subsidiaries of financial institutions based in Iran. 
7
The FATF later called upon its members to intro-
8
duce enhanced relevant reporting mechanisms or 
9
systematic reporting of financial transactions, and 
10
require increased external audit requirements, for fi-
11
nancial groups with respect to any of their branches 
12
and subsidiaries located in Iran. 
13
(3) According to the State Department’s 
14
‘‘Country Reports on Terrorism’’ in 2018, ‘‘Iran is 
15
the world’s foremost state sponsor of terrorism.’’ 
16
The regime has spent nearly one billion dollars per 
17
year to support terrorist groups that serve as its 
18
proxies and expand its malign influence across the 
19
globe. Tehran has funded international terrorist 
20
groups such as Hizballah, Hamas, and Palestinian 
21
Islamic Jihad.
