Whereas Diwali is a festival of lights, during which celebrants 
light small oil lamps, place them around the home, and 
pray for health, knowledge, and peace; 
Whereas celebrants of Diwali believe that the rows of lamps 
symbolize the light within the individual that rids the 
soul of the darkness of ignorance; 
Whereas Diwali falls on the last day of the last month in the 
lunar calendar and is celebrated as a day of thanksgiving 
and the beginning of the New Year for many Hindus; 
Whereas for Hindus, Diwali is a celebration of the belief that 
light triumphs over darkness, and good triumphs over 
evil; 
Whereas for Sikhs, Diwali is feted as the day on which the 
sixth founding Sikh guru, Guru Hargobind, was released 
from captivity by the Mughal Emperor Jehangir; 
Whereas for Jains, Diwali marks the anniversary of the at-
tainment of Nirvana by Lord Mahavira, the last of the 
Tirthankaras (founders of the Jain philosophy); and 
Whereas Diwali is a celebration of great importance in In-
dian-American communities throughout the United 
States: Now, therefore, be it
