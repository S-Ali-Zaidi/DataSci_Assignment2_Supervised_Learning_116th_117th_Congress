3
The Congress finds the following: 
4
(1) The Congress created a patent system to 
5
‘‘promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, 
6
by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inven-
7
tors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings 
8
and Discoveries,’’ as provided for in the Constitution 
9
of the United States. 
10
(2) The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act 
11
(Public Law 112–29) enacted on September 16, 
12
2011, and several decisions of the Supreme Court 
13
have harmed the progress of Science and the useful 
14
Arts by eroding the strength and value of the patent 
15
system. 
16
(3) The United States Government exists to 
17
protect life, liberty, and property, which includes in-
18
tellectual property.

3
sioned by the Constitution of the United States.

SEC. 3. RESTORING THE RIGHT OF THE FIRST INVENTOR 
5
TO SECURE A PATENT. 
6
(a) REPEAL OF FIRST-TO-FILE SYSTEM UNDER THE 
7
AMERICA INVENTS ACT.—Section 3 of the Leahy-Smith 
8
America Invents Act (Public Law 112–29), including each 
9
amendment made by such section, is repealed and any 
10
amendment made by such section to any provision shall 
11
be effective as if the provision had not been amended by 
12
such section. 
13
(b) FIRST-TO-INVENT.—Notwithstanding any other 
14
provision under title 35, United States Code, a person 
15
shall be entitled to a patent where the inventor is first 
16
to conceive of the invention and diligently reduces the in-
17
vention to practice. 
18
(c) ONE-YEAR GRACE PERIOD.—Notwithstanding 
19
any other provision under title 35, United States Code, 
20
a person shall be entitled to a one-year grace period before 
21
filing an application for a patent, as the grace period ex-
22
isted before the date of the enactment of the Leahy-Smith 
23

(d) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
4
gress that— 
5
(1) reverting the United States patent system 
6
from a ‘‘first-to-file’’ system back to ‘‘first-to-in-
7
vent’’ system will promote the progress of science 
8
and the useful arts by securing for limited times to 
9
inventors the exclusive rights to their discoveries and 
10
incentivize innovation and protect inventors’ rights; 
11
(2) restoring the one-year grace period before 
12
the first and true inventor must file a patent appli-
13
cation on an invention will promote the progress of 
14
science and useful arts by enabling inventors once 
15
again to disclose inventions in order to attract in-
16
vestment, complete research and development on the 
17
invention, test, improve, and perfect the invention so 
18
as to improve the invention and the quality of the 
19
patent application; and 
20
(3) the repeal of section 3, and the amendments 
21
made by section 3, of the Leahy-Smith America In-
22
vents Act, restore sections 100, 102, 103, 135, and

13
gress that— 
14
(1) inter partes review and post-grant review 
15
proceedings introduced by the Leahy-Smith America 
16
Invents Act have harmed the progress of science and 
17
the useful arts by subjecting inventors to serial chal-
18
lenges to patents; 
19
(2) inter partes review and post-grant review 
20
proceedings invalidate patents at an unreasonably 
21
high rate; 
22

9
gress that— 
10
(1) automatic publication of patent applications

ation of law that prevents a patent owner from ap-
14
plying for a patent on the same invention if a patent 
15
does not issue; and
