RESOLUTION 
Supporting the goals and ideals of a National Move Over 
Law Day. 
Whereas the House of Representatives wishes to recognize 
tow truck operators (as defined by the Federal Highway 
Workers Association Manual of Uniform Traffic Control 
Devices) as private sector responders; 
Whereas due to the increasingly high rate of distracted driv-
ers on the roadway, many towing operators lose their 
lives while performing their duties each year; 
Whereas nationally in 2018 the towing industry lost 21 tow-
ers, of which it is aware, to roadside collisions; 
Whereas every State has a ‘‘move over’’ law, which has cor-
related directly to a safer environment along our Nation’s 
roadsides for towers, law enforcement, first responders, 
and stranded citizens;

•HRES 373 IH 
Whereas these laws generally require motorists to move at 
least one lane over when there is an emergency or rescue 
activity taking place on the shoulder or side of the road-
way; or, if unable to do so safely, to alternatively slow 
down and pass the scene with caution; and 
Whereas providing the towing industry and law enforcement 
an enhanced opportunity to inform the motoring public 
about these laws is critical to the public safety: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the goals and ideals of a National 
2
Move Over Law Day; 
3
(2) urges the national incident management or-
4
ganizations, as well as State and regional incident 
5
management organizations, to spread awareness and 
6
promote the existence of, and adherence to, State 
7
move over laws; and 
8
(3) urges the national incident management or-
9
ganizations, and similar State and regional incident 
10
management organizations, to further educate the 
11
public on the dangers and loss of life if the provi-
12
sions and requirements of State move over laws are 
13
not faithfully observed.
