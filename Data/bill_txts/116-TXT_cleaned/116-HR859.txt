vide safe, high-quality health care in all settings across 
the United States; 
Whereas, with an estimated population of more than 
4,000,000 registered nurses in the United States and 
20,700,000 registered nurses worldwide, nurses and mid-
wives— 
(1) represent nearly 50 percent of the global health 
workforce; and 
(2) are the largest single component of the health 
care professions; 
Whereas investing in nurses and midwives provides great 
value to communities; 
Whereas a report of the High-Level Commission on Health 
Employment and Economic Growth of the United Na-
tions concluded that ‘‘investments in education and job 
creation in the health and social sectors result in a triple 
return of improved health outcomes, global health secu-
rity, and inclusive economic growth’’; 
Whereas nurses and midwives have contributed to major 
global health achievements, including— 
(1) the eradication of smallpox; and 
(2) the dramatic reductions in maternal and child 
mortality that have occurred in many countries; 
Whereas, for the 18th consecutive year, nurses ranked first 
in the annual Most Honest and Ethical Professions Poll 
conducted by Gallup; 
Whereas that poll found that 85 percent of the people of the 
United States rate the honesty and ethical standards of 
nurses as high or very high;

cates, acting to protect the lives of the individuals under

life; 
(2) are invaluable members of the health care team; 
and 
(3) are leading in the delivery of quality care in a 
transformed health care system that improves patient 
outcomes and safety; 
Whereas better integration of the model of care used by 
nurses and midwives into health care systems is funda-
mental to reducing primary and maternity care provider 
shortages and improving maternal health outcomes; 
Whereas nurses and midwives are well-positioned to provide 
leadership to eliminate the health care disparities that 
exist in the United States, including the maternal health 
crisis; 
Whereas the Future of Nursing report of the Institute of 
Medicine has called for the nursing profession to meet 
the call for leadership in a team-based delivery model; 
Whereas nurses are experienced researchers, and the work of 
nurses encompasses a wide scope of scientific inquiry, in-
cluding clinical research, health systems and outcomes re-
search, and nursing education research; 
Whereas nurses provide culturally and ethnically competent 
care that is sensitive to the regional and community cus-
toms of individuals needing care;

frastructure, promoting healthy lifestyles and educating
