ones with chronic, disabling health conditions across 
1
the lifespan. 
2
(2) The economic value of uncompensated fam-
3
ily caregiving to the United States economy was esti-
4
mated at $470,000,000,000 in 2013, more than 
5
total Medicaid spending of $449,000,000,000, in-
6
cluding both Federal and State contributions for 
7
medical and long-term care in the same year. 
8
(3) While caring for the aging population re-
9
mains a growing concern, more than half of care re-
10
cipients are under age 75, and almost one-third are 
11
under age 50. 
12
(4) Respite provides temporary relief to care-
13
givers from the ongoing responsibility of caring for 
14
individuals of all ages with special needs. 
15
(5) Respite care is one of the most commonly 
16
requested caregiver support services. 
17
(6) Respite has been shown to provide family 
18
caregivers with the relief necessary to maintain their 
19
own health, balance work and family, bolster family 
20
stability, keep marriages intact, and avoid or delay 
21
more costly nursing home or foster care placements. 
22
(7) Delaying nursing home, institutional, or fos-
23
ter care placement of just one individual for several

months can save Medicaid, child welfare, or other 
1
government programs tens of thousands of dollars. 
2
(8) The Lifespan Respite Care Act of 2006 
3
(Public Law 109–442) was originally enacted to im-
4
prove the delivery and quality of respite care services 
5
available to families across all age and disability 
6
groups by establishing coordinated lifespan respite 
7
systems. 
8
(9) Thirty-seven States and the District of Co-
9
lumbia have received grants under the Lifespan Res-
10
pite Care Act of 2006 to improve the availability and 
11
quality of respite services across the lifespan. 
12
(10) For the Nation’s wounded servicemembers 
13
and veterans with traumatic brain injuries and other 
14
conditions, respite systems could be an integral life-
15
line for families in their new roles as lifelong family 
16
caregivers. 
17
(11) The Department of Veterans Affairs and 
18
Congress have both acknowledged the unique chal-
19
lenges facing caregivers of returning servicemembers 
20
and veterans, as well as the need for increased care-
21
giver services. 
22
(12) The increased utilization of, and costs to, 
23
long-term care systems requires the continued devel-
