Whereas this attack follows increasingly aggressive rhetoric 
and destabilizing actions on the part of Azerbaijan Presi-
dent Ilham Aliyev’s government toward Nagorno- 
Karabakh and Armenia, including a July 2020 Defense 
Ministry threat to bomb Armenia’s Metsamor Nuclear 
Power Plant; 
Whereas Azerbaijan’s ongoing military offensive, which in-
cludes the shelling of Stepanakert, Nagorno-Karabakh’s 
most densely populated city with a population of 55,200, 
has resulted in at least dozens of civilians killed and hun-
dreds wounded and, as of September 30, 2020, the threat 
to civilians continues; 
Whereas, as of September 30, 2020, the conflict has resulted 
in the deaths of at least 84 Nagorno-Karabakh 
servicemembers, and both Armenia and Azerbaijan have 
declared martial law, mobilized their Armed Forces, and 
called up Reserve Forces; 
Whereas the Guardian reports that Azerbaijan’s military ac-
tions in Nagorno-Karabakh may be part of a planned 
military operation; 
Whereas the conflict follows joint military exercises conducted 
by Turkey and Azerbaijan in August 2020; 
Whereas, according to multiple reports, including the Wash-
ington Post, Reuters, and the Guardian, in the weeks 
prior to Azerbaijan’s military operation Turkey recruited 
mercenaries from Syria and, as of September 29, 2020, 
has facilitated their deployment to Azerbaijan; 
Whereas the BBC, New York Times, and Washington Post 
have reported on the Armenian Foreign Ministry’s claim

down an Armenian Su–25 fighter jet in Armenian air-
space, killing the pilot; 
Whereas the conflict has the potential to escalate into proxy 
warfare among regional powers, including Turkey, and to 
further entrench the conflict and threaten peace and sta-
bility in the region; 
Whereas the United States serves as a co-chair of the Minsk 
Group along with France and Russia, and the co-chairs 
have urged a cease-fire and urged the parties to return 
to substantive negotiations as soon as possible; and 
Whereas the European Union and the United Nations sup-
port a peaceful resolution and immediate cease-fire: Now, 
therefore, be it
