RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the 10th anniversary of Outdoor Afro. 
Whereas Outdoor Afro started as a blog about nature in 
2009 and has grown into a cutting-edge nationwide net-
work with volunteer leaders in 30 States, guiding hun-
dreds of outdoor events each year based on a simple mis-
sion to celebrate and inspire African-American connec-
tions to nature through recreational activities like camp-
ing, hiking, birding, fishing, gardening, skiing, and more; 
Whereas, in the past 10 years, Outdoor Afro, a national non-
profit organization, has cultivated and trained more than 
200 outdoor leaders, leading thousands of outdoor events, 
and reaching well over 150,000 participants; 
Whereas Outdoor Afro has disrupted the false perception that 
African Americans do not have a relationship with nature 
and is inspiring access to the most pristine nature as well

spaces; 
Whereas Outdoor Afro not only promotes a healthy lifestyle, 
it also helps communities find healing, connect to Black 
history found in many natural areas, and inspires an in-

enjoy; 
Whereas Outdoor Afro has shifted the visual representation 
of who can connect with and lead in the outdoors by of-
fering activities such as hiking, biking, camping, environ-
mental education, conservation stewardship, and more; 
Whereas Outdoor Afro held its first international expedition 
in 2018 to climb Mt. Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, which was 
widely covered in the media; 
Whereas Outdoor Afro is engaging millions of people through 
digital outreach by reaching 50,000 people per day and 
is changing the narrative of who engages in the outdoors 
by posting thousands of photos and stories; 
Whereas Outdoor Afro’s growing network mostly comprises 
college-educated, civically engaged men and women, many 
who plan and act on behalf of children and senior com-
munity members, thereby restoring African-American 
leadership in nature back to the home; 
Whereas more than any other group, African Americans turn 
to Outdoor Afro for advice on where to recreate, which 
outdoor gear to use, and which causes need our greatest 
attention; and 
Whereas 2019 marks the 10th year since Outdoor Afro has 
established itself as a community that supports recon-
necting African Americans with natural spaces and one
