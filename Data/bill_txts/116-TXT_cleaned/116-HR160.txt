RESOLUTION 
Expressing concern about the threat posed to democracy 
and human rights by theocratic groups operating in 
South Asia. 
Whereas Bangladesh achieved independence in 1971 and es-
tablished a secular democratic state, which is home to 
over 163 million Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, Christians, 
and atheists; 
Whereas this freedom was won at the cost of approximately 
3,000,000 deaths, more than 10,000,000 displaced, and 
200,000 women raped, many at the hands of Islamist 
militants led by Jamaat-e-Islami; 
Whereas Bangladesh plays a critical role in the safe and vol-
untary repatriation of over 800,000 Rohingya Muslims 
who have taken refuge in Bangladesh from religious and 
political persecution in Myanmar;

Whereas religious minorities, including Hindus, Buddhists, 
Christians, and Ahamadi Muslims, have been attacked by 
Jamaat-e-Islami, and their subsidiary Islami Chhatra 
Shibir, as a result of which hundreds of homes have been 
damaged, shops damaged or looted, and temples vandal-
ized; 
Whereas Jamaat-e-Islami applauded the assassination of 
Punjab Governor Salmaan Taseer for defending the 
rights of Asia Bibi, a Christian woman accused of blas-
phemy in Pakistan; 
Whereas Jamaat-e-Islami led funeral prayers for the terrorist 
who assassinated Salmaan Taseer, during which they 
prayed for the strength and power to enforce Shariah 
throughout the world; 
Whereas Jamaat-e-Islami has refused to accept the acquittal 
of Asia Bibi on blasphemy charges and worked to prevent 
her from leaving Pakistan where she faces mortal danger; 
Whereas Jamaat-e-Islami members have been linked with al- 
Qaida and the Taliban; 
Whereas Jamaat-e-Islami and affiliated theocratic extremist 
groups pose an immediate and ongoing threat to stability 
and secular democracy in South Asia, leaving religious 
minorities at grave risk of continuing violence; 
Whereas the European Parliament adopted a resolution urg-
ing the Bangladesh Nationalist Party to unequivocally 
distance itself from Jamaat-e-Islami; 
Whereas respected Bangladeshi jurist and political opposition 
leader Kamal Hossain has publicly called for the Ban-

Whereas various organizations in the United States that re-
ceive Federal funds, such as the Islamic Circle of North 
America, share leadership and are openly affiliated with 
Jamaat-e-Islami;

istered charitable organization in the United States, 
openly partnered in 2017 with Pakistan’s Falah-e- 
Insaniat Foundation, which the United States Govern-
ment designated as a terrorist organization in 2016; 
Whereas repeated attacks on religious minorities, expanding 
religious extremism, and growing destabilization caused 
by radical groups, including Jamaat-e-Islami and its af-
filiates, undermine United States economic and strategic 
interests in Bangladesh; and 
Whereas there is a growing trend of Islamic extremism in 
South Asia tied to pro-Islamic State of Iraq and Syria 
activity, with several arrests of Islamists linked with the 
terrorist group made in recent years: Now, therefore, be 
it
