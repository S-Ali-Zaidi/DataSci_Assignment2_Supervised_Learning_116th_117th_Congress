RESOLUTION 
Affirming the nature and importance of the United States– 
Iraq bilateral relationship, including security and eco-
nomic components of the relationship. 
Whereas the United States remains committed to supporting 
a sovereign and democratic Iraq at peace with its neigh-
bors and safe for its citizens, regardless of their religion, 
sect, or ethnicity; 
Whereas in 2014, forces of the Islamic State (commonly 
known as ‘‘IS’’ and also known as ‘‘ISIS’’ or ‘‘ISIL’’) 
seized significant territory in Iraq, leading Iraq’s Prime 
Minister to request international military intervention; 
Whereas the United States began military intervention 
against the Islamic State in Iraq in 2014, working with

•HRES 1062 IH 
international coalition partners and Iraqi security forces 
to combat the Islamic State and to retake Iraqi territory 
from Islamic State fighters; 
Whereas the Islamic State ruled areas it controlled with ter-
ror and brutal violence, including through heinous acts 
such as mass executions, public beheadings, desecration 
of holy sites, sexual enslavement and rape, and abuse and 
torture of minors; 
Whereas the Government of Iraq declared military victory 
against the Islamic State in December 2017, but insur-
gent attacks by remaining terrorist fighters have contin-
ued and threaten peace and stability in some areas of 
Iraq; 
Whereas an estimated 6 million Iraqis have been rendered in-
ternally displaced since 2014, of which 1.4 million remain 
internally displaced; 
Whereas members of religious and ethnic minority groups, in-
cluding Iraqi Christian communities and Yezidis, faced 
particular brutality under the Islamic State and often 
lacked the resources and capacity for protection; 
Whereas the Islamic State’s destructive rule and ensuing 
military campaign left large areas of key population cen-
ters uninhabitable, including Anbar, Salah al-Din, and 
Ninewa governorates, where efforts at resettlement, re-
construction, service delivery, governance, and security 
remain challenging; 
Whereas the United Nations Office for the Coordination of 
Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) 2020 humanitarian 
needs assessment previously anticipated that as many as 
4.1 million Iraqis will need some form of humanitarian 
assistance in 2020, and humanitarian needs are likely to

•HRES 1062 IH 
be further exacerbated by socio-economic disruptions at-
tributable to the COVID-19 pandemic; 
Whereas the United States was the top donor to the 2018 
and 2019 United Nations Iraq Humanitarian Response 
Plans and has contributed nearly $2.75 billion to human-
itarian relief efforts in Iraq since 2014, including more 
than $750 million in humanitarian support since fiscal 
year 2018; 
Whereas in July 2017, the United Nations Office for the Co-
ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) reported 
that ‘‘after decades of war, the sheer volume of explosive 
devices renders Iraq one of the most heavily contami-
nated countries in the world’’; 
Whereas multiple nongovernmental human rights organiza-
tions and media investigations have reported that areas 
still suffering from the lack of reconstruction, service de-
livery, governance, and security are acutely susceptible to 
re-radicalization by Islamic State underground cells or 
follow-on elements; 
Whereas human rights organizations have reported that thou-
sands of displaced Iraqis, including children, are unable 
to obtain or replace civil documentation due to displace-
ment caused by Islamic State; 
Whereas some paramilitary forces, including some elements 
of the ‘‘Popular Mobilization Units’’ or ‘‘PMUs’’ that 
mobilized to fight Islamic State terrorists have yet to be 
fully integrated into national security institutions and 
threaten civilian populations in some areas, including vul-
nerable minority groups; 
Whereas in late 2019, some Iraqi security force units, includ-
ing non-state militias, responded violently to peaceful

•HRES 1062 IH 
protests resulting in the deaths of more than 550 Iraqi 
civilians and many more injured; 
Whereas in 2019 and 2020, Iranian aligned militias, some of 
whom operate Iraqi PMUs conducted numerous attacks 
on United States and coalition forces in Iraq as well as 
Iraqi military facilities and Iraqi nationals, including a 
December 2019 attack that killed a United States citizen 
contractor and wounded others, and a March 2020, at-
tack that killed a United States servicemember, a United 
States contractor, a British soldier, and injured at least 
a dozen other troops; 
Whereas Iranian aligned militias and some PMUs were re-
portedly involved in the December 31, 2019, to January 
1, 2020, siege on the United States Embassy in Bagh-
dad, in which attackers set fire to structures and dam-
aged property; 
Whereas in July 2019 the Combined Joint Task Force-Oper-
ation Inherent Resolve (CJTF–OIR) informed the De-
partment of Defense and Department of State Inspector 
General that the Islamic State in Iraq continues to re-
cruit from isolated rural areas ‘‘exploiting perceived 
weaknesses and failures of the Iraqi government, particu-
larly in Sunni areas where the population feels ne-
glected’’; 
Whereas a July 2019 Department of Defense and Depart-
ment of State Lead Inspector General (LIG) Report to 
Congress on Operation Inherent Resolve stated the ‘‘De-
partment of State and USAID reported that the greatest 
obstacles preventing IDPs from returning . . . are lack 
of security and economic opportunity, and damage to 
housing’’ as well as a lack of ‘‘legal assistance to recover 
or renew identification documents’’;

Whereas in March 2020 Iraq confirmed its first case of 
COVID-19, which soon spread throughout the country, 
straining Iraq’s already struggling healthcare system, and 
infecting 64,000 Iraqis and killing 2,685 Iraqis, including 
592 Iraqi doctors, as of June 2020; and 
Whereas the LIG reported in May 2020 that ‘‘the emergence 
of COVID-19 in Iraq has further restricted humanitarian 
access and presented a significant risk to internally dis-
placed person (IDP) and refugee camps across the coun-
try’’: Now, therefore, be it
