SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Philippine Human 
2
Rights Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) The U.S. State Department’s 2019 Human 
6
Rights Report on the Philippines states ‘‘There were 
7
numerous reports of government security agencies 
8
and their informal allies committed arbitrary or un-
9
lawful killings in connection with the government di-
10
rected campaign against illegal drugs.’’. The Report 
11
goes on to state, ‘‘Government mechanisms to inves-
12
tigate and punish abuse and corruption in the secu-
13
rity forces were poorly resourced and remained 
14
largely ineffective’’. The United Nations Office of 
15
the High Commissioner on Human Rights in its an-
16
nual report for the 44th Session of the Human 
17
Rights Council concluded that there is ‘‘long-stand-
18
ing overemphasis on public order and national secu-
19
rity at the expense of human rights has become 
20
more acute in recent years, and there are concerns 
21
that the vilification of dissent is being increasingly 
22
institutionalized and normalized in ways that will be 
23
very difficult to reverse;’’. 
24
(2) The United States continues to provide sup-
25
port via security assistance to the administration of

Philippines President Duterte, whose brutal Drug 
1
War and other campaigns have taken the lives of 
2
over 30,000 urban poor, peasants, workers, indige-
3
nous and environmental activists as well as human 
4
rights defenders, religious leaders, and peace advo-
5
cates. 
6
(3) Government agencies of the Philippines re-
7
port 4,948 suspected drug users and dealers, includ-
8
ing 60 children, died during police operations from 
9
July 1, 2016 to September 30, 2018, and according 
10
to Human Rights Watch, the Philippine National 
11
Police (PNP) have reported 22,983 deaths remain 
12
classified as ‘‘homicides under investigation’’ since 
13
the Drug War began. 
14
(4) As of April 2020, the Alliance for Advance-
15
ment of People’s Rights (‘‘Karapatan’’) has docu-
16
mented 308 extrajudicial political killings, 439 vic-
17
tims of attempted politically motivated killings, 214 
18
victims of torture, around 2,500 victims of illegal ar-
19
rests, over 100,000 victims of threats and harass-
20
ments, and nearly half a million internal refugees 
21
under the Duterte administration. 
22
(5) More than 16 mayors and vice mayors have 
23
been killed since President Duterte took office, and 
24
Duterte has personally spoke blatantly in press con-

ferences advocating for the killing of Catholic 
1
bishops during a period where three Catholic priests 
2
were assassinated. 
3
(6) Labor leaders and legislators have also been 
4
amongst those attacked by the administration, with 
5
30 labor leaders killed, 3 labor leaders being held as 
6
political prisoners, and Senator Leila De Lima who 
7
has been a staunch critic of the drug war killings 
8
having been detained for over 2 years. 
9
(7) The international NGO Global Witness has 
10
declared the Philippines to be the deadliest country 
11
in the world for defenders of human rights, the envi-
12
ronment, and natural resources, with 13 environ-
13
mentalists, 54 indigenous people, and 207 farmers 
14
and peasants extrajudicially killed since Duterte 
15
took office in 2016. Included in the targeting of en-
16
vironmental activists was American citizen, Brandon 
17
Lee, who was subjected to an assassination attempt 
18
on August 6, 2019. Brandon has been subjected to 
19
repeated threats and harassment by the Philippine 
20
military due to his advocacy relating to the land and 
21
rights of indigenous people in Ifugao province and 
22
the surrounding Cordillera region of the Philippines. 
23
While Brandon Lee survived the attack, he has been

left paralyzed and his assailants have not been 
1
brought to justice. 
2
(8) It is widely recognized that the Duterte ad-
3
ministration silences dissent and the press. The 
4
State Department’s 2019 Report states, ‘‘Govern-
5
ment harassment of some media outlets occurred, 
6
however, and polls suggested many Filipinos con-
7
sider it dangerous to publish information critical of 
8
the administration.’’ In May 2020, ABS-CBN, one 
9
of the Philippines’ two major sources of news, and 
10
an occasional critic of Duterte’s policies, was forced 
11
off air due to the denial of a franchise license by the 
12
Congress of the Philippines, at the behest of the 
13
Duterte administration. Similarly, Maria Ressa, a 
14
vocal critic of the Duterte administration, Times 
15
Magazine’s Person of the Year 2018 recipient, and 
16
founder of the digital news site Rappler was con-
17
victed of cyber libel in June 2020. In July 2020, the 
18
Duterte administration signed the ‘‘Anti-Terrorism 
19
Act of 2020’’ into law. Countless Filipino and inter-
20
national commentators, including fifty U.S. Rep-
21
resentatives have warned that the law will be used 
22
to further target critics and silence dissent. 
23
(9) The United States continues to arm state 
24
security forces of the Philippines. Despite clear doc-

umentation of abuses and international condemna-
1
tion, in April 2020, the United States announced a 
2
pair of arms sales totaling $2,000,000,000 for items 
3
including hellfire missiles and attack helicopters. In 
4
July 2020, the United States announced an addi-
5
tional sale of $126,000,000 worth of assault boats 
6
and armaments.
