SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
10
Congress makes the following findings: 
11
(1) The North Korean nuclear weapons pro-
12
gram is the culmination of the Government of North 
13
Korea’s illegal efforts over six decades to acquire a 
14
nuclear weapons program capable of threatening 
15
both the United States and United States critical al-
16
lies in the Indo-Pacific region. 
17
(2) North Korea maintains a robust ballistic 
18
missile arsenal that includes a diverse array of deliv-
19
ery systems capable of striking targets throughout 
20
the Indo-Pacific region, including short- and me-
21
dium-range missiles that hold regional countries, in-
22
cluding some United States allies, at risk, and inter-
23
continental ballistic missiles that are potentially ca-
24
pable of targeting the United States mainland.

•HR 2949 IH
(3) North Korea has flagrantly defied the inter-
1
national community by continuing to illicitly develop 
2
its nuclear and ballistic missile programs in violation 
3
of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 
4
1718 (2006), 1874 (2009), 2087 (2013), 2094 
5
(2013), 2270 (2016), 2321 (2016), 2356 (2017), 
6
2371 (2017), 2375 (2017), and 2397 (2017).

(4) United States law, including the North 
8
Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act of 
9
2016 (Public Law 114–122; 22 U.S.C. 9201 et seq.) 
10
authorizes sanctions in response to North Korea’s 
11
pursuit of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, 
12
and ballistic missiles, and its human rights abuses. 
13
United States law also specifies the conditions under 
14
which sanctions may be removed or waived, includ-
15
ing that North Korea takes meaningful and 
16
verifiable actions toward denuclearization and ad-
17
dresses human rights concerns. 
18
(5) International economic and diplomatic sanc-
19
tions applied since the passage of the North Korea 
20
Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act of 2016, in-
21
cluding by the United States and the United Na-
22
tions, when enforced, have intensified pressure on 
23
North Korea and degraded North Korea’s ability to 
24
advance it’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.

(6) The United States has applied sanctions 
1
against North Korean individuals and entities, in-
2
cluding on Kim Jong Un, for their complicity in 
3
human rights abuses against the North Korean peo-
4
ple and citizens of other countries, including the 
5
United States, South Korea, and Japan. 
6
(7) For decades, the Government of North 
7
Korea has failed to live up to its diplomatic commit-
8
ments, rejecting good faith efforts by United States 
9
and international negotiators, and leveraging talks 
10
to extract concessions such as sanctions relief. 
11
(8) On January 1, 2018, in a New Year’s Day 
12
address, Kim Jong Un signaled an interest in under-
13
taking diplomatic engagement, which led to direct 
14
bilateral talks between Kim Jong Un and the leaders 
15
of the South Korea, China, and the United States. 
16
(9) On April 22, 2018, Kim Jong Un asserted 
17
that North Korea had completed its quest for nu-
18
clear weapons, stating that ‘‘under the proven condi-
19
tion of complete nuclear weapons, we no longer need 
20
any nuclear tests, mid-range and intercontinental 
21
ballistic rocket tests, and that the nuclear test site 
22
in northern area has also completed its mission’’.

27, 2018, and the joint declaration by President 
1
Trump and Kim Jong Un at the June 12, 2018, 
2
summit between the United States and North Korea 
3
in Singapore reaffirmed that North Korea ‘‘commits 
4
to working toward the complete denuclearization of 
5
the Korean Peninsula’’. 
6
(11) On June 13, 2018, Secretary of State 
7
Pompeo said, ‘‘President Trump has been incredibly 
8
clear about the sequencing of denuclearization and 
9
relief from the sanctions. We are going to get com-
10
plete denuclearization; only then will there be relief 
11
from the sanctions.’’. 
12
(12) The Secretary of State confirmed on July 
13
25, 2018, in testimony before the Senate Foreign 
14
Relations Committee, that North Korea does ‘‘con-
15
tinue to produce fissile material’’ and, according to 
16
open source analysis, North Korea has enough fissile 
17
material for at least 30 to 60 nuclear weapons. 
18
(13) The North Korea Sanctions and Policy 
19
Enhancement Act of 2016 provides that certain 
20
sanctions terminate when North Korea has ‘‘made 
21
significant progress toward— 
22
(A) ‘‘completely, verifiably, and irreversibly 
23
dismantling all of its nuclear, chemical, biologi-
24
cal, and radiological weapons programs, includ-
25

ing all programs for the development of systems 
1
designed in whole or in part for the delivery of 
2
such weapons’’; and 
3
(B) accounting for and repatriating the 
4
citizens of other countries abducted or unlaw-
5
fully held captive, releasing political prisoners 
6
including those in political prison camps, and 
7
accepting and abiding by internationally recog-
8
nized standards for the distribution and moni-
9
toring of humanitarian aid. 
10
(14) A robust military posture, including reg-
11
ular training and exercises, by the United States, 
12
South Korea, and Japan, has contributed to peace 
13
and stability in Northeast Asia. 
14
(15) South Korea has contributed heavily to its 
15
own defense and to the defense of the United States 
16
military forces in South Korea, including by pro-
17
viding $10 billion of the $10.8 billion toward the 
18
Camp Humphreys project to build and relocate 
19
United States military forces to a new base in South 
20
Korea. 
21
(16) United States military forces, pursuant to 
22
international law, are lawfully deployed on the Ko-
23
rean Peninsula.

•HR 2949 IH
(17) The nuclear and ballistic missile programs 
1
of North Korea are clear and consistent violations of 
2
international law. 
3
(18) The long-stated strategic objective of au-
4
thoritarian states, such as China, Russia, and North 
5
Korea, has been the removal of United States mili-
6
tary forces from the Korean Peninsula. 
7
(19) On September 18, 2018, the Pyongyang 
8
Declaration between President Moon of South Korea 
9
and Chairman Kim Jong Un of North Korea clari-
10
fied that North Korea’s willingness to denuclearize 
11
was conditioned on unspecified United States or 
12
international concessions stating, ‘‘The North ex-
13
pressed its willingness to continue to take additional 
14
measures, such as the permanent dismantlement of 
15
the nuclear facilities in Yeongbyeon, as the United 
16
States takes corresponding measures in accordance 
17
with the spirit of the June 12 U.S.–DPRK Joint 
18
Statement.’’. 
19
(20) On December 31, 2018, President Trump 
20
signed into law the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act 
21
of 2018 (Public Law 115–409), which states that— 
22
(A) it is the policy of the United States

complete, verifiable, and irreversible dismantle-
2
ment of such programs; 
3
(B) it is the policy of the United States to 
4
continue to impose sanctions with respect to ac-
5
tivities of the Government of the Democratic 
6
People’s Republic of Korea, persons acting for 
7
or on behalf of such government, or other per-
8
sons in accordance with applicable United 
9
States law; 
10
(C) the Secretary of State shall submit 
11
regular reports to the appropriate congressional 
12
committees that describe actions taken by the 
13
United States to address the threats posed by, 
14
and the capabilities of, the Democratic People’s 
15
Republic of Korea; and 
16
(D) the Secretary of State, in consultation 
17
with the Secretary of the Treasury, shall submit 
18
justifications to the appropriate committees not 
19
later than 30 days after terminating any sanc-
20
tion with respect to the activities of the Govern-
21

•HR 2949 IH
(21) On December 20, 2018, North Korean 
1
state media reiterated North Korea’s longstanding 
2
nuclear policy, stating ‘‘if we unilaterally eliminate 
3
our security guarantees against a U.S. nuclear pre-
4
emptive 
strike, 
it 
would 
not 
be 
considered 
5
denuclearization’’, 
and 
further 
defined 
6
‘‘denuclearization of the Korean peninsula’’ as ‘‘re-
7
moving all nuclear threats, not only from North and 
8
South Korean territory, but also from the sur-
9
rounding area aimed at the Korean Peninsula’’. 
10
(22) On January 1, 2019, in his New Year’s 
11
Day address, Kim Jong Un stated, ‘‘Given that the 
12
North and South committed themselves to advancing 
13
along the road of peace and prosperity, we maintain 
14
that the joint military exercises with foreign forces, 
15
which constitute the source of aggravating the situa-
16
tion on the Korean Peninsula, should no longer be 
17
permitted and the introduction of war equipment in-
18
cluding strategic assets from outside should be com-
19
pletely suspended.’’. 
20
(23) On January 1, 2019, in his New Year’s 
21
Day address, Kim Jong Un further stated, ‘‘But if 
22
the United States does not keep the promise it made 
23
in the eyes of the world, and of the miscalculation 
24
of our people’s patience, it attempts to unilaterally

enforce something upon us and persists in imposing 
1
sanctions and pressure against our Republic, we may 
2
be compelled to find a new way for defending the 
3
sovereignty of the country and the supreme interests 
4
of the state and for achieving peace and stability of 
5
the Korean Peninsula.’’. 
6
(24) On January 29, 2019, Director of Na-
7
tional Intelligence Coats testified before the Select 
8
Committee on Intelligence of the Senate that ‘‘we 
9
currently assess that North Korea will seek to retain 
10
its WMD (weapons of mass destruction) capabilities 
11
and is unlikely to completely give up its nuclear 
12
weapons and production capability because its lead-
13
ers ultimately view nuclear weapons as critical to re-
14
gime survival’’ and that the United States intel-
15
ligence agencies are observing ‘‘activity that is incon-
16
sistent with full denuclearization’’. 
17
(25) On February 28, 2019, a second United 
18
States-North Korea summit ended without a joint 
19
statement or agreement, and Secretary of State 
20
Pompeo has said that ‘‘I am confident there will be’’ 
21
a third summit between President Trump and 
22
Chairman Kim Jong Un, adding ‘‘We came out of 
23
Hanoi with a deeper understanding of each other. 
24
The positions that the two sides had, the two leaders

were able to make progress in that respect. We 
1
didn’t get as far as the world is demanding. These 
2
are global sanctions that are on North Korea today 
3
. . . We’re determined. I’m convinced the North Ko-
4
reans are determined as well. Chairman Kim has 
5
promised me, he’s promised President Trump, he 
6
will denuclearize. Now it’s the mission of my team 
7
to make sure that happens.’’. 
8
(26) On May 5, 2019, North Korea tested three 
9
missile systems at ranges of up to 240 kilometers, 
10
including a short-range ballistic missile (SRBM), a 
11
300mm multiple rocket launcher (MRL), and a 
12
240mm multiple rocket launcher. 
13
(27) On May 9, 2019, the Department of Jus-
14
tice announced the filing of a civil forfeiture com-
15
plaint against a bulk carrier ship registered in North 
16
Korea, which according to the complaint, ‘‘was used 
17
to illicitly ship coal from North Korea and to deliver 
18
heavy machinery to the DPRK’’, in violation of 
19
‘‘longstanding U.S. law and United Nations Security 
20
Council resolutions’’.
