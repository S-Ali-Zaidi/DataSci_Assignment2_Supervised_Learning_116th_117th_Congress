SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress makes the following findings: 
2
(1) An effective transportation system for the 
3
Nation requires dedicated, predictable Federal fund-
4
ing for various capital and operating expenses, as 
5
demonstrated by the Highway Trust Fund, which 
6
supports all Federal highway programs, most public 
7
transit programs, and many Federal transportation 
8
safety programs. 
9
(2) Intercity passenger rail is the only surface 
10
transportation mode in the United States that— 
11
(A) does not receive any Federal funding 
12
through a trust fund for capital investment; 
13
and 
14
(B) is completely dependent on annual dis-
15
cretionary appropriations for both its capital ex-
16
penses and its operating costs. 
17
(3) In fiscal year 2019, Amtrak experienced 
18
record ridership, a historic low-operating loss, and a 
19
record capital spend rate. 
20
(4) In markets with sufficient infrastructure 
21
and train frequency, Amtrak has proven to be an ef-
22
fective mode of transportation when compared to 
23
commercial air and bus service and private auto-
24
mobile use.

(5) Intercity passenger rail offers substantial 
1
safety, energy, and environmental advantages over 
2
most other transportation modes, but decades of in-
3
sufficient capital funding has drastically limited the 
4
role that intercity passenger rail can play in the Na-
5
tion’s overall transportation network. 
6
(6) There are critical capital needs on both the 
7
Northeast Corridor and the National Network, in-
8
cluding infrastructure, fleet, stations and facilities. 
9
(7) Adding to the urgency of all these needs, 
10
due to changing demographics, population growth, 
11
urbanization, and changing travel trends, intercity 
12
passenger rail will be needed to help move our Na-
13
tion into the future. 
14
(8) For these reasons, an Intercity Passenger 
15
Rail Trust Fund is needed now, more than ever, to 
16
ensure a safe, sustainable, convenient transportation 
17
option for the people of the United States.
