Whereas despite the shortage of protective gear in many of 
our Nation’s hospitals, health care workers continue to 
show up and risk their lives to save the lives of others; 
Whereas these men and women continue to go above and be-
yond the call of duty to serve citizens across the Nation; 
Whereas law enforcement officers continue to check in on 
their neighbors and keep our communities safe; 
Whereas no part of our Nation could successfully battle this 
pandemic without the coordination and assistance of our 
first responders and health care providers; 
Whereas first responders serve as key sources of information 
to community and national leaders; and 
Whereas when people need help, these first responders are al-
ways counted upon to assist: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-

(1) health care workers and first responders

should be recognized for their bravery and contribu-
4
tions during this global pandemic; and

every day.
