SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
The Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Climate change threatens global stability 
3
and our national economy. 
4
(2) Carbon emissions are a significant contrib-
5
utor to these threats and must be addressed. 
6
(3) The United States private sector can face 
7
these challenges and be a global leader in tech-
8
nology, innovation, and efficiency. 
9
(4) A price on carbon levels the economic play-
10
ing field and spurs adoption of less carbon-intensive 
11
practices and technologies. 
12
(5) Recycling revenues back to employers and 
13
employees will neutralize the potential impacts of a 
14
tax.
