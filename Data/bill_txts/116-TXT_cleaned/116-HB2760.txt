A BILL 
To further deployment of Next Generation 9–1–1 to enhance 
and upgrade the 9–1–1 systems of the United States, 
and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Next Generation 9– 
4
1–1 Act of 2019’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress makes the following findings: 
7
(1) The 9–1–1 systems of the United States, 
8
while a model for the entire world, lack the advanced 
9
functionality, interoperability, and capabilities that 
10

•HR 2760 IH
come with the adoption of new digital communica-
1
tions technologies. 
2
(2) 
Communications 
technologies 
currently 
3
available to the public, including first responders 
4
and other public safety personnel, have substantially 
5
outpaced the legacy communications technologies 
6
still used by most emergency communications cen-
7
ters in the 9–1–1 systems of the United States. 
8
(3) This lack of modern technology, when cou-
9
pled with other challenges, is impacting the ability of 
10
the 9–1–1 systems of the United States to efficiently 
11
and effectively provide responses to emergencies. 
12
(4) Modernizing the 9–1–1 systems of the 
13
United States to incorporate the new and evolving 
14
capabilities of broadband voice and data communica-
15
tions is essential for the safety and security of the 
16
public, including first responders and other public 
17
safety personnel. 
18
(5) Efforts to modernize the 9–1–1 systems of 
19
the United States to date, while laudable and impor-
20
tant, have been limited due to a lack of funding and 
21
inconsistent or unclear policies related to the govern-
22
ance, deployment, and operations of Next Genera-
23
tion 9–1–1.

•HR 2760 IH
(6) A nationwide strategy for Next Generation 
1
9–1–1 has become essential to help guide the transi-
2
tion and create a common framework for implemen-
3
tation of Next Generation 9–1–1 while preserving 
4
State, regional, and local control over the governance 
5
and technology choices of the 9–1–1 systems of the 
6
United States. 
7
(7) Accelerated implementation of Next Genera-
8
tion 9–1–1 will— 
9
(A) increase compatibility with emerging 
10
communications trends; 
11
(B) enhance the flexibility, reliability, and 
12
survivability of the 9–1–1 systems of the United 
13
States during major incidents; 
14
(C) improve emergency response for the 
15
public, including first responders and other 
16
public safety personnel; 
17
(D) promote the interoperability of the 9– 
18
1–1 systems of the United States with emer-
19
gency response providers including users of the 
20
Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network 
21
being deployed by the First Responder Network 
22
Authority; and 
23
(E) increase the cost effectiveness of oper-
24
ating the 9–1–1 systems of the United States.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
1
It is the sense of Congress that— 
2
(1) the 9–1–1 professionals in the United 
3
States perform important and lifesaving work every 
4
day, and need the tools and communications tech-
5
nologies to perform the work effectively in a world 
6
with digital communications technologies; 
7
(2) the transition from the legacy communica-
8
tions technologies used in the 9–1–1 systems of the 
9
United States to Next Generation 9–1–1 is a na-
10
tional priority and a national imperative; 
11
(3) the United States should complete the tran-
12
sition described in paragraph (2) as soon as prac-
13
ticable; 
14
(4) the United States should develop a nation-
15
wide framework that facilitates cooperation among 
16
Federal, State, and local officials on deployment of 
17
Next Generation 9–1–1 in order to meet that goal; 
18
(5) the term ‘‘Public Safety Answering Point’’ 
19
becomes outdated in a broadband environment and 
20
9–1–1 centers are increasingly and appropriately 
21
being referred to as emergency communications cen-
22
ters; and 
23
(6) 9–1–1 authorities and emergency commu-
24
nications centers should have sufficient resources to 
25
implement Next Generation 9–1–1, including re-
26

sources to support associated geographic information 
1
systems (commonly known as ‘‘GIS’’), and cyberse-
2
curity measures. 
3
SEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
4
It is the policy of the United States that— 
5
(1) Next Generation 9–1–1 should be techno-
6
logically and competitively neutral; 
7
(2) Next Generation 9–1–1 should be interoper-
8
able; 
9
(3) the governance and control of the 9–1–1 
10
systems of the United States, including Next Gen-
11
eration 9–1–1, should remain at the State, regional, 
12
and local level; and 
13
(4) individuals in the United States should re-
14
ceive information on how to best utilize Next Gen-
15
eration 9–1–1 and on its capabilities and usefulness.
