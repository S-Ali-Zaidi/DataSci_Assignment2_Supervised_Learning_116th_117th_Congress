RESOLUTION 
Supporting the development of guidelines for ethical

touches every aspect of American society; 
Whereas AI has demonstrated increasing competency in areas 
as diverse as image and speech recognition, autonomous 
driving, and the mastery of complex games; 
Whereas AI has the potential to transform the economy and 
dramatically alter industries including health care, retail, 
finance, energy, transportation, law, education, and man-
ufacturing over the coming years;
