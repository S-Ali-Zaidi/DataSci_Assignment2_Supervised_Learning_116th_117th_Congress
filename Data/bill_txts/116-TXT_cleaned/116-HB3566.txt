‘‘(n)(1) Not later than 1 year after the date of the

9
section 202 by reason of being under a disability in the 
10
following manner:

‘‘(A) An individual shall be classified as ‘med-
12
ical improvement expected’ if the impairment or 
13
combination of impairments causing the individual 
14

15
the point where the individual will no longer be dis-
16
abled in 12 to 24 months.

4
bination of impairments causing the individual to be 
5
disabled is not expected to medically improve to the 
6
point where the individual will no longer be disabled 
7

‘‘(D) An individual shall be classified as ‘med-

is chronic or progressive with permanent, irreversible

13
no known effective therapy, treatment, or surgical

‘‘(2) In classifying an individual under the system es-
18
tablished under this subsection, the Commissioner of So-
19
cial Security shall not classify an individual as ‘medical 
20

21
