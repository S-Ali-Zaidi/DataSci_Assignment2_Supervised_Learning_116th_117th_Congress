16
It is the sense of Congress that— 
17
(1) lead is a dangerous neurotoxin that can per-
18
manently impact brain development, especially in 
19
young children; 
20
(2) the Centers for Disease Control, the Envi-
21
ronmental Protection Agency, the American Associa-
22

23
termined that there is no safe level of lead exposure;

(3) for vulnerable populations like young chil-

Agency, lead service lines are the single largest 
8
source of lead in drinking water; and

only a portion of a lead service line is replaced, can 
11
increase lead exposure.
