A BILL 
To amend the Public Health Service Act to create a National 
Neuromyelitis Optica Consortium to provide grants and 
coordinate research with respect to the causes of, and 
risk factors associated with, neuromyelitis optica, and 
for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Neuromyelitis Optica 
4
Consortium Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 321 IH
(1) Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is a dev-
1
astating neurologic disease leading to blindness and 
2
paralysis. 
3
(2) There are an estimated 16,000 to 17,000 
4
people with NMO in the United States and a quar-
5
ter-million worldwide. 
6
(3) Women are affected 4 to 5 times more than 
7
men, and Afro-Caribbeans are about 2.5 times more 
8
predisposed to NMO than Caucasians. The reasons 
9
why Blacks are disproportionately affected cannot be 
10
fully understood without further studies. 
11
(4) The average age at diagnosis is between 40 
12
and 50 years, but the range is broad and includes 
13
children as young as 3 years of age and adults as 
14
old as 90 years of age. 
15
(5) NMO incurs substantial costs for affected 
16
patients and their families. 
17
(6) The cause of NMO is unknown, but it is hy-
18
pothesized to be autoimmune in nature. 
19
(7) More than 90 percent of NMO patients will 
20
suffer recurrent disease and accumulate neurologic 
21
disability. 
22
(8) Because of their relatively low overall inci-
23
dence, orphan diseases like NMO frequently do not 
24
receive sufficient attention and research funding. 
25

•HR 321 IH
(9) No single institution has a sufficient num-
1
ber of patients to independently conduct research 
2
that will adequately address the cause of NMO. 
3
(10) There has been no comprehensive study 
4
analyzing all relevant clinical, biological, and epide-
5
miological aspects of NMO to identify potential risk 
6
factors and biomarkers for NMO. 
7
(11) We can apply our understanding of NMO 
8
to the study of other autoimmune diseases, including 
9
multiple sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
11
It is the sense of Congress that there is a need— 
12
(1) to establish and coordinate a multicenter re-
13
search effort based on collaboration between regional 
14
consortia and governmental and nongovernmental 
15
entities in order to— 
16
(A) comprehensively study the causes of 
17
NMO; and 
18
(B) identify potential biomarkers of disease 
19
activity; and 
20
(2) to encourage a collaborative effort among 
21
academic medical centers with epidemiological study 
22
groups to gather comprehensive and detailed infor-
23
mation for each patient enrolled in those groups, in 
24
order to investigate environmental, nutritional, and

genetic factors with respect to, and the pathological

and epidemiological characteristics of, NMO.
