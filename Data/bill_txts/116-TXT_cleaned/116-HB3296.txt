SEC. 2. PURPOSE. 
1
The purpose of this Act is to ensure timely access 
2
to affordable birth control by requiring coverage without 
3
cost-sharing for oral birth control for routine, daily use 
4
that is approved by, or otherwise legally marketed under 
5
regulation by, the Food and Drug Administration for use 
6
by women without a prescription. 
7
SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
8
The House of Representatives finds the following: 
9
(1) Birth control is critical health care that al-
10
most all women will use at some point in their life-
11
times. 
12
(2) Access to the full range of reproductive 
13
health care, including birth control coverage as guar-
14
anteed under Federal law, provides women with the 
15
opportunity to lead healthy lives and get the care 
16
they need to reach their goals. 
17
(3) Family planning has well-documented 
18
health benefits for women, newborns, families, and 
19
communities and can lower the risk of harm to ma-
20
ternal and infant health. 
21
(4) An estimated 66,000,000 women of repro-
22
ductive age (ages 15 through 44) live in the United 
23
States, of which nearly 70 percent are at risk of 
24
having an unintended pregnancy. Sixty percent of 
25
women of reproductive age are using a contraceptive

method and 10 percent of women at risk for unin-
1
tended pregnancy are not using contraception. The 
2
rates of non-use of contraception are highest among 
3
those between 15 and 19 years old. 
4
(5) The birth control benefit enacted under the 
5
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public 
6
Law 111–148) has been a crucial step forward in 
7
advancing access to birth control and has helped en-
8
sure nearly 62,800,000 women have the power to de-
9
cide for themselves if and when to start a family. 
10
(6) Despite legal requirements for birth control 
11
coverage and access to services, gaps remain for mil-
12
lions of women. A national survey found that 1 in 
13
3 women have struggled to afford birth control at 
14
some point in their lives, and as a result, have used 
15
birth control inconsistently. Access to birth control is 
16
particularly difficult for women who live in contra-
17
ceptive deserts and lack reasonable access to a 
18
health center that offers the full range of contracep-
19
tive methods. 
20
(7) Health disparities persist among low-income 
21
women, women of color, and women who lack access 
22
to health coverage and health care providers. 
23
(8) There are numerous social and economic 
24
barriers that make it harder to access birth control, 
25

•HR 3296 IH
including rising income and wealth inequality, gaps 
1
in insurance coverage and challenges accessing 
2
health providers. 
3
(9) Leading health experts support over-the- 
4
counter birth control pills. 
5
SEC. 4. SENSE OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. 
6
It is the sense of the House of Representatives that— 
7
(1) in order to increase women’s access to oral 
8
birth control, it must be both easier to obtain and 
9
affordable and, to make it either easier to obtain or 
10
more affordable, but not both, is to leave unaccept-
11
able barriers in place for women; 
12
(2) it is imperative that the entities that re-
13
search and develop oral birth control and whose 
14
medical and scientific experts have developed clinical 
15
and other evidence that oral birth control for rou-
16
tine, daily use is safe and effective for women when 
17
sold without a prescription, apply to the Food and 
18
Drug Administration for review and approval for 
19
sale of such birth control without a prescription; 
20
(3) upon the receipt of such an application, the 
21
Food and Drug Administration should determine 
22
whether the oral birth control meets the rigorous 
23
safety, efficacy, and quality standards for over-the- 
24
counter use under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cos-
25

metic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.), and if the prod-
1
uct meets those standards, the Food and Drug Ad-
2
ministration should approve the application without 
3
delay; and 
4
(4) if and when the Food and Drug Adminis-
5
tration approves an oral birth control that is avail-
6
able over-the-counter, such birth control should be 
7
covered by health insurance, without a prescription 
8
and without cost-sharing. 
9
SEC. 5. CLARIFYING COVERAGE REQUIREMENTS. 
10
The Secretaries of Health and Human Services, 
11
Labor, and the Treasury shall clarify that coverage of con-
12
traceptives pursuant to section 2713(a)(4) of the Public 
13
Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300gg–13(a)(4)) includes 
14
coverage of over-the-counter contraceptive methods ap-
15
proved by the Food and Drug Administration, even if the 
16
enrollee does not have a prescription for the contraceptive.
