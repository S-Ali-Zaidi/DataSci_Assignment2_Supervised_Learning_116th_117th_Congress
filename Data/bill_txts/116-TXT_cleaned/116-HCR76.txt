CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the significance of equal pay and the disparity 
in wages paid to Latina women in comparison to men. 
Whereas November 20, 2019, is Latina Equal Pay Day, 
which marks the day that symbolizes how long into 2019 
Latina women, on average, must work to make what 
White, non-Hispanic men were paid in 2018; 
Whereas section 6(d) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 
1938 (29 U.S.C. 206(d)(1)) prohibits discrimination in 
wages on the basis of sex for equal work;

Whereas title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 
2000e et seq.) prohibits discrimination in compensation 
because of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex; 
Whereas despite the passage of the Equal Pay Act of 1963 
(29 U.S.C. 206 note) more than 5 decades ago, which es-
tablishes that employers shall not discriminate in wages 
on the basis of sex but shall provide equal pay for equal 
work, Census Bureau data shows that Latina women 
working full-time, year-round are typically paid 54 cents 
for every dollar paid to White, non-Hispanic men; 
Whereas if the current trends continue, on average Latina 
women will have to wait 205 years to achieve equal pay; 
Whereas the median annual pay for a Latina woman in the 
United States working full-time, year-round is $33,540, 
which means that, on average, Latina women lose over 
$1.1 million dollars in potential earnings over their life-
time to the wage gap; 
Whereas certain groups of Latinas experience even wider pay 
gaps, with noncitizen immigrant Latinas being paid just 
38 cents for every dollar paid to White, non-Hispanic 
male workers; 
Whereas lost wages mean Latina women have less money to 
support themselves and their families, save and invest for 
the future, and spend on goods and services; 
Whereas the underpayment of Latina workers cause busi-
nesses and the economy to suffer; 
Whereas Latina women’s median earnings are less than 
men’s at every level of academic achievement, with 
Latina women with less than a high school diploma earn-
ing 18 percent less than White, non-Hispanic men, and 
Latina women with an advanced degree earning 20 per-

cent less than White, non-Hispanic men with the same 
level of education; 
Whereas in the United States, more than 60.3 percent of 
Latina mothers are primary, sole or cobreadwinners for 
their families, but Latina mothers working full-time, 
year-round are typically paid only 46 percent as much as 
White fathers; 
Whereas the lack of access to affordable, quality child care, 
paid family and medical leave, paid sick leave, and other 
family friendly workplace policies force many Latina 
women to choose between their paycheck or job and get-
ting quality care for themselves or their family members, 
and contributes to the wage gap; 
Whereas if the wage gap were eliminated, on average, a 
Latina woman working full-time, year-round would have 
enough money for approximately 3 years of child care; 
more than 3 additional years of tuition and fees for a 4- 
year public university, or the full cost of tuition and fees 
for a 2-year community college; nearly 4 years of food for 
her family; more than 18 additional months of mortgage 
and utilities payments; 2 years of rent payments; among 
other basic living expenses; 
Whereas workplace harassment forces many women to leave 
their occupation or industry, as targets of harassment 
were 6.5 times as likely as nontargets to change jobs, or 
pass up opportunities for advancement, and this contrib-
utes to the gender wage gap; 
Whereas nearly two-thirds of workers paid the minimum 
wage or less are women, and there is a disproportionate 
concentration of women of color in low-wage and tipped 
jobs;

Whereas more than 40 percent of private sector employees 
say that discussion of wage and salary information is dis-
couraged and another 25 percent report that it is for-
mally prohibited, which can hide pay discrimination and 
prevent remedies; 
Whereas the pay disparity Latina women face is part of a 
wider set of disparities Latina women face in homeowner-
ship, unemployment, poverty, access to child care, and 
the ability to accumulate wealth; 
Whereas true pay equity requires a multi-faceted strategy 
that addresses the gender and racial injustices that 
Latina women face daily; and 
Whereas many national organizations have designated No-
vember 20, 2019, as Latina Equal Pay Day to represent 
the additional time that Latina women must work into 
the next calendar year to receive the earnings of their 
White, non-Hispanic counterparts in the prior Census 
year: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate 
1
concurring), That Congress— 
2
(1) recognizes the disparity in wages paid to 
3
Latina women and its impact on women, families, 
4
the economy and our entire country; and 
5
(2) reaffirms its support for ensuring equal pay 
6
and closing the gender wage gap.
