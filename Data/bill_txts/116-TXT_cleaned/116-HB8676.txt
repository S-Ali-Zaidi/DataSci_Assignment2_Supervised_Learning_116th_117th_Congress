Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Opposing Foreign 
4
Fundraising at United States Embassies Act of 2020’’ or 
5
the ‘‘OFF U.S. Embassies Act of 2020’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
7
Congress makes the following findings: 
8
(1) The promotion of democratic institutions 
9
and free and fair elections is a key foreign policy ini-

tiative of the United States, carried out by the De-
1
partment of State through its embassies, diplomats, 
2
programs, and policies around the world. 
3
(2) Meeting with and building relationships 
4
with a range of political parties in foreign countries 
5
are appropriate and important functions consistent 
6
with the duties of any United States Ambassador or 
7
representative of the United States Government 
8
abroad. 
9
(3) It is the longstanding and bipartisan prac-
10
tice of the United States to encourage democratic 
11
norms, free and fair elections, rule of law, and free 
12
speech abroad, without regard for political party or 
13
affiliation. 
14
(4) The use of United States embassy or con-
15
sulate grounds, or the grounds of any other United 
16
States diplomatic post, to raise funds for any foreign 
17
political party or candidate in a foreign democratic 
18
electoral process is inappropriate and distinct from 
19
longstanding Department of State efforts to engage 
20
with foreign persons, including democracy activists 
21
and representatives of political parties, to advance 
22
democratic institutions and universal values around 
23
the world.

(5) On September 10, 2020, United States Am-
1
bassador to the Netherlands Pete Hoekstra held a 
2
private event for a Dutch political party and its do-
3
nors at the United States Embassy in The Hague. 
4
(6) The invitations to the event asked guests to 
5
join the United States Embassy ‘‘at the invitation of 
6
the Forum for Democracy and Pete Hoekstra,’’ and 
7
included contact details for the ‘‘Head of Fund-
8
raising’’ of that foreign political party. 
9
(7) Prior donors to the political party were in-
10
vited and attended the event at the United States 
11
Embassy. 
12
(8) The leader of the foreign political party 
13
used the event at the United States Embassy to 
14
speak about campaign strategy and to display a 
15
video made ahead of the 2021 electoral campaign in 
16
the Netherlands. 
17
(9) Following news reports highlighting the 
18
similarities between the September 10, 2020, event 
19
held at the United States Embassy and a political 
20
fundraiser, Dutch lawmakers raised concerns, with 
21
one member of parliament calling on the Dutch For-
22
eign Ministry to investigate whether Ambassador 
23
Hoekstra had ‘‘facilitated a fund raising event for a 
24
political party’’.

(10) Such behavior is part of a pattern in which 
1
Department of State officials under President Don-
2
ald J. Trump have publicly engaged in political ac-
3
tivities that break with the longstanding practice of 
4
not using one’s official position to lend support to 
5
particular parties or candidates, domestic or foreign, 
6
with whom one shares a partisan affinity. 
7
(11) In 2018, United States Ambassador to 
8
Germany Richard Grenell said, from his official resi-
9
dence in Berlin, ‘‘I absolutely want to empower 
10
other conservatives throughout Europe’’ and praised 
11
the leader of an Austrian political party, leading 
12
multiple German political figures to publicly rebuke 
13
the United States Ambassador for political inter-
14
ference.
