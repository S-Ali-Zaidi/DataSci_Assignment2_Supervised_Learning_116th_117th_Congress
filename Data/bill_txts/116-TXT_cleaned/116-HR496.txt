RESOLUTION 
Affirming that all Americans have the right to participate 
in boycotts in pursuit of civil and human rights at home 
and abroad, as protected by the First Amendment to 
the Constitution. 
Whereas boycotts have been effectively used in the United 
States by advocates for equal rights since the Boston Tea 
Party and include boycotts led by civil rights activists 
during the 1950s and 1960s in order to advocate for ra-
cial equality, such as the Montgomery bus boycott, and 
promote workers’ rights, such as the United Farm Work-
ers-led boycott of table grapes; 
Whereas Americans of conscience have a proud history of 
participating in boycotts to advocate for human rights

(1) attempting to slow Japanese aggression in the 
Pacific by boycotting Imperial Japan in 1937 and 1938; 
(2) boycotting Nazi Germany from March 1933 to 
October 1941 in response to the dehumanization of the 
Jewish people in the lead-up to the Holocaust;

the 1980 summer Olympics in Moscow in protest of the 
Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in the preceding year; and 
(4) leading the campaign in the 1980s to boycott

country; 
Whereas the Supreme Court, in the 1966 case Rosenblatt v. 
Baer, held that the First Amendment to the Constitution 
ensures that ‘‘[c]riticism of government is at the very

Whereas the Supreme Court held in the 1982 case NAACP 
v. Claiborne Hardware that ‘‘[t]he right of the States to 
regulate economic activity could not justify a complete

boycott . . . .’’; 
Whereas the Supreme Court has recognized various activities 
as ‘‘expressive conduct’’ warranting constitutional protec-
tion, such as flag burning, wearing black armbands, si-

tempt to stifle constitutionally protected political expres-
sion: Now, therefore, be it
