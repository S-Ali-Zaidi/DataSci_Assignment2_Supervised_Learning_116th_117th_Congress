(1) it is crucial to understand the vulnerabilities 
1
to the national security of the United States re-
2
vealed by the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID–19)

7
terrorist attack;

14
creasing likelihood of pandemic threats (such as the 
15
recent threats of severe acute respiratory syndrome 
16
(SARS), Ebola, the 2009–H1N1 influenza, and 
17
COVID–19) and health issues that the United 
18
States could face during the next several decades; 
19
and 
20
(4) the commission established under section 2 
21
should use the authority under subsection (j)(1) of
