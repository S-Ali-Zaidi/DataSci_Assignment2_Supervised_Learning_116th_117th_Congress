•HR 7157 IH
(1) The Fiscal Year 2018 Population Represen-
1
tation in the Military Services report found that 
2
while minorities comprise 38 percent of the national 
3
population, they comprise only 23 percent of the ac-
4
tive component commissioned officer corps. 
5
(2) The Fiscal Year 2018 Population Represen-
6
tation in the Military Services report further found 
7
that African Americans only comprised 8 percent of 
8
the active component commissioned officer corps, 
9
while more than 12 percent of the general popu-
10
lation is African American. 
11
(3) The Fiscal Year 2018 Population Represen-
12
tation in the Military Services report further found 
13
that African-American and Hispanic cadets were re-
14
cipients of a Reserve Officers’ Training Corps 
15
(ROTC) scholarship at a rate of half of their rep-
16
resentation in the general population. 
17
(4) A 2018 RAND study titled ‘‘Understanding 
18
Demographic Differences in Undergraduate Pilot 
19
Training Attrition’’ found that ‘‘[candidates for pilot 
20
training from Reserve Officers’ Training Corps pro-
21
gram] with more hours of flying experience were also 
22
less likely to be eliminated from Initial Flight Train-
23
ing and Primary Pilot Training’’.

(5) In 2020, Air Education and Training Com-
1
mand, in partnership with the University of Texas- 
2
San Antonio, conducted a study that reinforced, in-
3
cluding within the Pilot Candidate Selection Method, 
4
the number of flight hours a candidate accumulates 
5
before attending undergraduate pilot training. 
6
(6) The United States Air Force has acknowl-
7
edged that ‘‘flight hours . . . can be difficult to ob-
8
tain for potential candidates depending on their 
9
socio-economic background’’.
