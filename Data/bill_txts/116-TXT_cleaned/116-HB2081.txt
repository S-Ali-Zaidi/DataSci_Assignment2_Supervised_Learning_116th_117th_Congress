‘‘SEC. 10409B. CHRONIC WASTING DISEASE RESEARCH

‘‘(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that— 
8
‘‘(1) a focus on research into the transmission 
9
of, resistance to, and epidemiology of chronic wast-
10
ing disease is needed to inform future policies to 
11
combat the disease and ensure the health of cervid 
12
populations; 
13
‘‘(2) because States have diverse policies for ad-
14
dressing chronic wasting disease, the Federal Gov-
15
ernment should coordinate financial and technical 
16
support to States, State departments of agriculture, 
17
institutions of higher education, and research cen-
18
ters conducting scientific research on chronic wast-
19
ing disease; 
20
‘‘(3) under current policies, chronic wasting dis-
21
ease remains a systemic threat to cervids; and 
22
‘‘(4) scientific advances that lead to the ability 
23
to stop transmission of chronic wasting disease are 
24
needed to ensure the long-term viability of cervids.
