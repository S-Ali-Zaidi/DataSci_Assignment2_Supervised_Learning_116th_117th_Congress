SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) According to the Fourth National Climate 
6
Assessment, climate change, which results in ocean 
7
warming, acidification, and oxygen loss, is rapidly al-
8
tering the abundance, productivity, and distribution 
9
of fish stocks. 
10
(2) United States commercial and recreational 
11
fisheries generate approximately $210 billion in sales 
12
impacts each year and are a critical economic driver 
13
for thousands of coastal communities. 
14
(3) Changing water temperatures have already 
15
affected many commercially and recreationally tar-
16
geted fish stocks. 
17
(4) Changing conditions and effects on fish 
18
stocks are impacting subsistence fishing, which is 
19
critical to food security and culture for Alaska Na-
20
tive and American Indian tribes, and fishing commu-
21
nities throughout the Nation, according to the 
22
Fourth National Climate Assessment. 
23
(5) The impacts of climate change on fish are 
24
resulting in a cascade of management and sustain-

ability challenges, which negatively affect marine 
1
ecosystems, fishermen, and fishing communities. 
2
(6) A better understanding of current efforts 
3
underway by the Regional Fishery Management 
4
Councils, the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Com-
5
mission, and the National Marine Fisheries Service 
6
to address the impact of climate change on fishery 
7
management is needed to ensure our fisheries and 
8
their marine ecosystems are well prepared for chang-
9
ing ocean conditions.

SEC. 3. REPORT ON EFFORTS TO PREPARE AND ADAPT 
11
UNITED STATES FISHERY MANAGEMENT FOR 
12
THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. 
13
(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 1 year after the 
14
date of enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General 
15
of the United States shall submit a report to Congress 
16
examining efforts by the Regional Fishery Management 
17
Councils, the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commis-
18
sion, and the National Marine Fisheries Service to prepare 
19
and adapt to the impacts of climate change. 
20
(b) CONTENTS
OF STUDY.—The report required 
21
under subsection (a) shall include— 
22
(1) an examination of current or previous ef-
23
forts, and whether those efforts have resulted in

Fisheries Commission, and the National Marine

Fisheries Service to prepare and adapt Federal and 
3
jointly managed fisheries for the impacts of climate

change; 
5
(2) an examination of any guidance issued to 
6
the Regional Fishery Management Councils by the 
7
National Marine Fisheries Service to prepare and 
8
adapt Federal fishery management for the impacts 
9
of climate change and whether and how that guid-

ance has been utilized; 
11
(3) identification of and recommendations for 
12
how best to address the most significant economic, 
13
social, ecological, or other knowledge gaps, as well as 
14
key funding gaps, that would increase the ability of 
15
the Regional Fishery Management Councils, the At-

17
National Marine Fisheries Service to prepare and

change; 
20
(4) recommendations for how the Regional 
21
Fishery Management Councils, the Atlantic States 
22
Marine Fisheries Commission, and the National Ma-
23
rine Fisheries Service can better adapt fishery man-

(5) recommendations for how to enhance the

capacity of the National Marine Fisheries Service to

monitor climate-related changes to fisheries and ma-

change, to evaluate risks and priorities, to provide
