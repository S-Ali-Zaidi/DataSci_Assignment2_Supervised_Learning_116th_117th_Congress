1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Medicare requires beneficiaries to be hos-
3
pitalized for medically necessary inpatient hospital 
4
care for at least three consecutive days before cov-
5
ering post-hospital care in a skilled nursing facility 
6
under section 1861(i) of the Social Security Act (42 
7
U.S.C. 1395x(i)). 
8
(2) Often patients remain under ‘‘observation 
9
status’’ in the hospital for several days and these ob-
10
servation days are not counted toward the 3-day 
11
stay requirement because they are considered out-
12
patient days. 
13
(3) Hospitals’ use of observation stays has in-
14
creased sharply since 2006. According to the March 
15
2014 report of the Medicare Payment Advisory 
16
Commission, outpatient visits, many of which are ob-
17
servation stays, increased 28.5 percent between 
18
2006 and 2012, with a simultaneous 12.6-percent 
19
decrease in inpatient stays over this same six-year 
20
time period. A study published in Health Affairs 
21
found a 34-percent increase in the ratio of observa-
22
tion stays to inpatient admissions between 2007 and 
23
2009, leading the researchers to conclude that out-
24
patient observation status was becoming a substitute 
25
for inpatient admission. The same study also docu-
26

mented increases in long-stay outpatient status, in-
1
cluding an 88-percent increase in observation stays 
2
exceeding 72 hours. 
3
(4) To health care providers, care provided dur-
4
ing observation is indistinguishable from the care 
5
provided to inpatients and all medically necessary 
6
care is provided, regardless of patient status. Bene-
7
ficiaries are generally not informed of their inpatient 
8
or outpatient status and assume that they are inpa-
9
tients when they are placed in a hospital bed, only 
10
to find out that such care was not counted for pur-
11
poses of satisfying eligibility requirements for medi-
12
cally prescribed Medicare coverage of post-hospital 
13
care in a skilled nursing facility. 
14
(5) Older Americans and people with disabilities 
15
who are hospitalized but do not meet the 3-day inpa-
16
tient hospital stay requirement simply because they 
17
were placed in ‘‘outpatient observation status’’ for 
18
some or all of their hospital stay (even when their 
19
total actual stay exceeds three days in the hospital) 
20
can face a significant and unexpected financial bur-
21
den, which can amount to thousands of dollars, for 
22
skilled nursing facility care. Among beneficiaries 
23
who received care in a skilled nursing facility that 
24
Medicare did not cover, the average out-of-pocket 
25

charges were more than $10,000, according to the 
1
Office of Inspector General of the Department of 
2
Health and Human Services. 
3
(6) The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Serv-
4
ices (CMS) attempted to provide hospitals with clar-
5
ity on which patients should be categorized as inpa-
6
tients in the inpatient hospital payment rule for fis-
7
cal year 2014. However, this rule fails Medicare 
8
beneficiaries because it does not address the problem 
9
and explicitly states that days spent in observation 
10
status do not count for purposes of satisfying the 3- 
11
day inpatient stay requirement. 
12
(7) Because of CMS’ policy which indicates 
13
days under observation do not count towards the 3- 
14
day inpatient stay requirement, some patients under 
15
observation and their families will continue to face 
16
a significant, often insurmountable financial burden 
17
if they need skilled nursing care after their hospital 
18
stay. 
19
(8) This Act updates Medicare policy by deem-
20
ing patients under observation as inpatients for the 
21
purposes of satisfying the Medicare 3-day inpatient 
22
stay requirement. This Act does not repeal the 3-day 
23
inpatient stay requirement; rather it simply expands 
24
the Secretary’s administrative definition of ‘‘inpa-
25

tient’’ for purposes of the 3-day stay requirement to 
1
include time spent under observation. As such, it is 
2
not a reprise of the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage 
3
Act of 1988, which repealed the 3-day requirement. 
4
This Act simply restores the original objective of the 
5
3-day rule, which was to ensure Medicare coverage 
6
of skilled nursing facility stays following hospital 
7
care for patients who stayed in the hospital for 3 
8
days. 
9
(9) It is the intent of this Congress, through 
10
this Act, to allow access to skilled nursing care for 
11
the population of beneficiaries who meet medical ne-
12
cessity requirements for such care, but who do not 
13
satisfy the 3-day inpatient stay requirement simply 
14
because some or all of their time in the acute care 
15
hospital is characterized as ‘‘outpatient observation 
16
status’’ for billing purposes. 
17
(10) It is the understanding of Congress that 
18
the Secretary of Health and Human Services will 
19
monitor patterns of behavior to ensure that pro-
20
viders deliver appropriate and needed levels of care. 
21
(11) The Office of the Inspector General of the 
22
Department of Health and Human Services is sup-
23
portive of counting hospital observation days to-
24
wards the 3-day inpatient stay requirement. In addi-

Care

2
ommended that CMS’ count time spent in observa-
3
tion status toward meeting Medicare’s 3-day stay re-
4
quirement. In addition, in a December 2016 report, 
5
the Office of the Inspector General of the Depart-
6
ment of Health and Human Services found that an 
7
increased number of Medicare beneficiaries classified 
8
as outpatients are paying more for care that is sub-
9
stantively similar, and have limited access to skilled 
10
nursing facility care due to their patient status.

(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 1861(i) of the Social Se-
18
curity Act (42 U.S.C. 1395x(i)) is amended by adding at 
19
the end the following: ‘‘For purposes of this subsection, 
20
an individual receiving outpatient observation services 
21
shall be deemed to be an inpatient during such period, 
22
and the date such individual ceases receiving such services 
23
shall be deemed the hospital discharge date (unless such

individual is admitted as a hospital inpatient at the end 
1
of such period).’’. 
2
(b) EFFECTIVE DATE.—The amendment made by 
3
subsection (a) shall apply to receipt of outpatient observa-
4
tion services beginning on or after January 1, 2019, but 
5
applies to a period of post-hospital extended care services 
6
that was completed before the date of the enactment of 
7
this Act only if an administrative appeal is or has been 
8
made with respect to such services not later than 90 days 
9
after the date of the enactment of this Act. Notwith-
10
standing any other provision of law, the Secretary of 
11
Health and Human Services may implement such amend-
12
ment through an interim final regulation, program in-
13
struction, or otherwise.
