SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) In order to achieve domestic and inter-
3
national net-zero greenhouse gas emissions targets, 
4
a rapid and substantial investment in clean energy 
5
innovation is needed. 
6
(2) Clean energy technologies face unique ob-
7
stacles to successful commercial application, includ-
8
ing high up-front capital costs, long development 
9
times, and the need to displace incumbent tech-
10
nologies in highly regulated markets.

•HR 8273 IH
(3) Multiple technology development and fi-
1
nancing gaps exist in the clean energy innovation 
2
and commercial application landscape that are not 
3
currently met by private sector investment alone. 
4
(4) Federal investments in technology transfer 
5
and demonstration programs help fill existing gaps 
6
in the innovation cycle and improve the likelihood of 
7
successful and timely commercial application of 
8
clean energy technologies. 
9
(5) To maximize clean energy innovation’s posi-
10
tive impact on United States economic competitive-
11
ness and reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, 
12
the Department of Energy must show significant 
13
leadership in enabling the transfer of new tech-
14
nologies to the private sector, particularly through 
15
the Office of Technology Transitions.
