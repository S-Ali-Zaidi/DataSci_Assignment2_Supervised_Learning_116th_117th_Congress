RESOLUTION 
Supporting the Global Fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis 
(TB), malaria, and its Sixth Replenishment. 
Whereas the Global Fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis (TB), 
and malaria is an effective partnership of governments, 
the private sector, civil society, and affected communities 
to transform the response to these epidemics; 
Whereas since the Global Fund’s creation in 2002, and in 
close cooperation with the President’s Emergency Plan 
for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), more than 27,000,000 lives 
have been saved in countries where the Global Fund in-
vests; 
Whereas the Global Fund has contributed to extraordinary 
improvements in global health, including by helping to re-
duce by half the number of AIDS-related deaths since 
2005, contributing to a 37-percent decline in TB deaths

from 2000 to 2016, and a 60-percent decline in the num-
ber of malaria deaths since 2000; 
Whereas the Global Fund and its partners work to uphold a 
steadfast commitment to transparency and account-
ability, receiving high marks in multilateral aid reviews 
and by independent watchdogs; 
Whereas despite progress achieved to date in combating 
AIDS, TB, and malaria, significant challenges threaten 
future progress, including drug and insecticide resistance, 
reaching marginalized and vulnerable populations, and 
complacency in the fight against infectious diseases; 
Whereas United States leadership has been critical to the 
Global Fund’s success as its largest donor and through 
its oversight role on the Board of the Global Fund; 
Whereas the Global Fund amplifies and supports the results 
of United States bilateral heath programs, including the 
PEPFAR, the President’s Malaria Initiative, and the 
United States Agency for International Development TB 
program; 
Whereas a statutory cap on United States contributions to 
the Global Fund has successfully leveraged increased con-
tributions from other donors in prior Global Fund replen-
ishments and is expected to do so again during the Sixth 
Replenishment, to be held in Lyon, France, on October 
19, 2019; 
Whereas the United Kingdom and Japan, for example, al-
ready have pledged significant increases to the Global 
Fund for the Sixth Replenishment; 
Whereas the Global Fund’s requirements for cofinancing have 
spurred domestic investments, with recipient countries 
committing 41 percent more of their own funding to fight

AIDS, TB, and malaria for 2018 to 2020 compared to 
2015 to 2017; 
Whereas recipient countries are expected to increase their co- 
financing by 48 percent, growing to $46,000,000,000 
from 2021 to 2023; and 
Whereas with these resources secured, the Global Fund 
projects it will reduce the number of deaths due to AIDS, 
TB, and malaria by nearly 50 percent, avert 234,000,000 
infections or disease cases, and save an additional 
16,000,000 lives: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
