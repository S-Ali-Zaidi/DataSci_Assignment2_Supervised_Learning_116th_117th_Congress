9
tion and administering justice in a fair and impartial 
10
manner.

(2) Federal judges must be able to act without 
1
fear of personal reprisal from individuals affected by 
2
the decisions they make in the course of carrying out 
3
their public duties. 
4
(3) In recent years, partially as a result of the 
5
rise in the use of social media and online access to 
6
information, members of the Federal judiciary have 
7
been exposed to an increased number of personal 
8
threats in connection to their role. 
9
(4) Between 2015 and 2019, threats and other 
10
inappropriate 
communications 
against 
Federal 
11
judges and other judiciary personnel increased from 
12
926 in 2015 to approximately 4,449 in 2019. 
13
(5) Over the past decade, several members of 
14
the Federal judiciary have experienced acts of vio-
15
lence against themselves or a family member in con-
16
nection to their Federal judiciary role, including the 
17
murder of the family of United States District 
18
Judge for the Northern District of Illinois Joan 
19
Lefkow in 2005. 
20
(6) On Sunday July 19, 2020, an assailant 
21
went to the home of Esther Salas, a judge for the 
22
United States District Court for the District of New 
23
Jersey, impersonating a package delivery driver, 
24
opening fire upon arrival, and killing Daniel Anderl,

•HR 8591 IH
the 20-year-old son of Judge Salas, and seriously 
1
wounding Mark Anderl, her husband. 
2
(7) In the aftermath of the recent tragedy that 
3
occurred to Judge Salas and in response to the con-
4
tinuous rise of threats against members of the Fed-
5
eral judiciary, there is an immediate need for en-
6
hanced security procedures and increased availability 
7
of tools to protect Federal judges and their families.
