RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the importance of biomedical research and 
thanking biomedical researchers in the United States. 
Whereas biomedical researchers are working at a rapid pace 
to understand COVID–19, how it spreads, how it infects, 
who it infects, and why it progresses in such a deadly 
way; 
Whereas biomedical researchers are working at breakneck 
speed to find effective diagnostic tools and treatments, to 
see if other drugs might be useful and to find new ways 
to stop COVID–19 progression; 
Whereas biomedical researchers are working to develop vac-
cines that will be our best solution to stopping the virus 
and disease;

Whereas this research includes modeling the disease and po-
tential treatments in animals in order to steer the direc-
tion of human trials in the development of new treat-
ments and ideas for humans alongside the conduct of 
clinical trials so that new treatments are both effective 
and safe; 
Whereas there are tens of thousands of scientists, research-
ers, biological safety experts, animal care staff, clinical 
research staff, ethicists, and funders who are providing 
hope for the future; 
Whereas just like the doctors and nurses on the frontlines, 
the hard work and dedication of biomedical researchers 
saves lives and ensures we have a healthier community; 
and 
Whereas it is important to strengthen our research commu-
nity by cultivating knowledge and trust in research, in-
spiring students to pursue STEM fields, and fostering 
dialogue on the role of ethical and humane biomedical re-
search: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) commends our biomedical researchers, uni-
2
versities and research institutions, and hospitals in 
3
their efforts to ensure we have a healthier commu-
4
nity; and 
5
(2) encourages a continued commitment to bio-
6
medical research in the development of vaccines and 
7
treatments against diseases and infections.
