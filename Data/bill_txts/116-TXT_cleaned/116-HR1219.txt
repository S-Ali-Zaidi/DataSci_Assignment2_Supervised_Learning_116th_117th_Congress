8, 2020, as ‘‘National Apprenticeship Week’’. 
Whereas a highly skilled workforce is necessary to facilitate 
upward mobility, increase standards of living, create 
high-wage jobs, compete in the global economy, and sup-
port economic growth; 
Whereas the national registered apprenticeship system estab-
lished by the Act of August 16, 1937 (commonly known 
as the ‘‘National Apprenticeship Act’’; 50 Stat. 664, 
chapter 663; 29 U.S.C. 50 et seq.), which has existed for 
over 80 years—

(2) offers a combination of academic and technical 
instruction and paid on-the-job experience; 
(3) provides working people with portable, nationally 
recognized, industry credentials that lead to higher earn-
ing careers; and 
(4) develops a highly skilled workforce; 
Whereas registered apprenticeships— 
(1) are increasingly innovative and diverse in their 
design, their collaboration with local community partner-
ships, and their use of emerging educational and training 
concepts, including competency-based learning; 
(2) will continue to evolve to meet the emerging de-
mands of a 21st century workforce; 
(3) are critical elements of an effective workforce de-
velopment system and help individuals attain a recog-
nized postsecondary credential, contributing to their per-
sonal economic mobility; and 
(4) maintain high-quality standards for apprentices; 
Whereas the national registered apprenticeship system can 
provide education and training for apprentices in— 
(1) high-growth sectors, including information tech-
nology, financial services, advanced manufacturing, green 
energy, and health care; and 
(2) traditional industries including the building 
trades; 
Whereas, according to the Department of Labor, the national 
registered apprenticeship system leverages approximately 
$1,000,000,000 in private investment, largely in the con-
struction industry, which reflects the strong commitment 
of the sponsors of the national registered apprenticeship 
system;

Whereas the national registered apprenticeship system pro-
vides employers— 
(1) skilled workers trained to industry and employer 
specifications to produce quality results; 
(2) reduced turnover; 
(3) a diverse talent pipeline for new skilled workers 
and future managers; 
(4) reduced workers’ compensation costs due to an 
emphasis on safety training; 
(5) key employability skills such as improved em-
ployee engagement, greater problem-solving ability, flexi-
bility to perform a variety of tasks, and a reduced need 
for supervision; and 
(6) valuable contribution to output by apprentices; 
Whereas an evaluation of registered apprenticeship programs 
in 10 States conducted by Mathematica Policy Research 
in 2012 found that— 
(1) individuals who completed registered apprentice-
ship programs earned over $240,000 more over their ca-
reers than individuals who did not participate in reg-
istered apprenticeship programs; 
(2) over the career of an apprentice, the estimated 
social benefits of registered apprenticeship programs ex-
ceed the social costs by more than $49,000; and 
(3) the tax return on every dollar the Federal Gov-
ernment invested in registered apprenticeship programs 
was $27; 
Whereas according to the Department of Labor— 
(1) nearly 700,000 new registered apprenticeships 
have been created since January 1, 2017; 
(2) registered apprenticeships have a 94-percent 
placement rate at program completion; and

(3) after completion, registered apprenticeship par-
ticipants have an average annual salary of $70,000; and 
Whereas the celebration of National Apprenticeship Week— 
(1) honors industries that have mastered the reg-
istered apprenticeship model; 
(2) encourages expansion of the registered appren-
ticeship model into new industries; 
(3) encourages the creation of new opportunities for 
nontraditional apprenticeship populations like women and 
minorities; 
(4) recognizes the role the national registered ap-
prenticeship system has played in preparing workers for 
the jobs of today and tomorrow; and 
(5) promotes conversation about ways the national 
registered apprenticeship system can continue to respond 
to workforce challenges in the 21st century: Now, there-
fore, be it
