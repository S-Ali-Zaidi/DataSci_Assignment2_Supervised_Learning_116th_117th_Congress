Whereas cancer from radiation exposure is the second-leading 
cause of sickness and death on the Navajo Nation; 
Whereas the Environmental Protection Agency, upon the in-
sistence of the Navajo Nation, has secured settlement 
agreements with responsible parties to fund the cleanup 
of 219 of the abandoned uranium mines on the Navajo 
Nation; 
Whereas there are 305 abandoned uranium mines on the 
Navajo Nation for which Federal funds or settlement 
agreements are not available to fund their cleanup; and 
Whereas it is the express duty of the United States, through 
the Environmental Protection Agency, to address and en-
sure the timely remediation of the environmental con-
tamination resulting from abandoned uranium mines on 
the Navajo Nation: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-
