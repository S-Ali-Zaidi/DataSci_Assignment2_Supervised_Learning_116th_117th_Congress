Part B of the National Telecommunications and In-

921 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following

new section:

‘‘SEC. 120. ESTIMATE OF VALUE OF ELECTROMAGNETIC 
7
SPECTRUM. 
8
‘‘(a) ESTIMATES REQUIRED.—The NTIA, in con-
9
sultation with the Commission and the Director of OMB, 
10
shall estimate the value of electromagnetic spectrum in the 
11
covered band that is assigned or otherwise allocated to 
12
each Federal entity as of the date of the estimate, in ac-
13
cordance with the schedule under subsection (b). 
14
‘‘(b) SCHEDULE.—The NTIA shall conduct the esti-
15
mates under subsection (a) for the covered bands be-
16
tween— 
17
‘‘(1) 225 megahertz and 33 gigahertz not later 
18
than 1 year after the date of enactment of this sec-
19
tion, and every 3 years thereafter;

‘‘(2) 33 gigahertz and 66 gigahertz not later 
21
than 2 years after the date of enactment of this sec-
22
tion, and every 3 years thereafter; and

‘‘(c) BASIS FOR ESTIMATE.— 
1
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—The NTIA shall base each 
2
value estimate under subsection (a) on the value 
3
that the electromagnetic spectrum would have if the 
4
spectrum were reallocated for the use with the high-
5
est potential value of licensed or unlicensed commer-
6
cial wireless services that do not have access to that 
7
spectrum as of the date of the estimate. 
8
‘‘(2) CONSIDERATION OF GOVERNMENT CAPA-
9
BILITIES.—In estimating the economic value of spec-
10
trum under subsection (a), the NTIA may consider 
11
the spectrum needs of commercial interests while 
12
preserving the spectrum access necessary to satisfy 
13
mission requirements and operations of Federal enti-
14
ties. 
15
‘‘(3) DYNAMIC SCORING.—To the greatest ex-
16
tent practicable, the NTIA shall incorporate dynamic 
17
scoring methodology into the value estimate under 
18
subsection (a). 
19
‘‘(4) DISCLOSURE.— 
20
‘‘(A) IN
GENERAL.—Subject to subpara-
21
graph (B), the NTIA shall publicly disclose how 
22
the NTIA arrived at each value estimate under 
23
subsection (a), including any findings made 
24
under paragraph (2).

ON VALUE
OF ELECTRO-

MAGNETIC SPECTRUM.—The head of a Federal entity that
