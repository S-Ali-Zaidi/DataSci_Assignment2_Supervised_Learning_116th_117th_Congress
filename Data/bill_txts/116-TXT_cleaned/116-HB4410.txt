To provide for the establishment of the Thorium-Bearing 
Rare Earth Refinery Cooperative, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; STATEMENT OF POLICY.

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
8
02:00 Sep 21, 2019
H4410
2 
•HR 4410 IH
(1) Rare earth elements are critical for ad-
1
vanced energy technologies, national defense, and 
2
other commercial and industrial applications. 
3
(2) The People’s Republic of China (referred to 
4
in this subsection as ‘‘China’’) has leveraged its mo-
5
nopoly control over the rare earth value chain to 
6
force corporations from the United States, Europe, 
7
Japan, and South Korea to transfer manufacturing 
8
facilities, technology, and jobs to China in exchange 
9
for secure supply contracts. 
10
(3) The increasingly aggressive mercantile be-
11
havior of China has led to involuntary transfers of 
12
technology, manufacturing, and jobs, which has re-
13
sulted in onerous trade imbalances with the United 
14
States and trading partners of the United States. 
15
(4) The Comptroller General of the United 
16
States has confirmed that the monopoly control of 
17
China over the rare earth value chain has resulted 
18
in vulnerabilities in the procurement of multiple 
19
United States weapons systems. 
20
(5) Direct links exist between rare earth min-
21
eralogy and thorium. 
22
(6) Thorium is a radioactive element commonly 
23
associated with the lanthanide elements in most rare 
24
02:00 Sep 21, 2019
H4410
3 
•HR 4410 IH
earth deposits located in the United States and else-
1
where. 
2
(7) Regulations regarding thorium represent a 
3
barrier to the development of a rare earth industry 
4
that is based in the United States. 
5
(8) Meeting the strategic national interest ob-
6
jectives of the United States and economic and envi-
7
ronmental goals are best achieved through the cre-
8
ation of a rare earth cooperative. 
9
(9) A rare earth cooperative could— 
10
(A) greatly increase the production of rare 
11
earth elements; 
12
(B) ensure environmental safety; and 
13
(C) lower the cost of the production and fi-
14
nancial risks faced by rare earth producers in 
15
the United States. 
16
(10) Historically, agricultural and electric co-
17
operatives have stood as one of the greatest success 
18
stories of the United States. 
19
(b) STATEMENT OF POLICY.—It is the policy of the 
20
United States to advance domestic refining of rare earth 
21
elements and the safe storage of thorium in anticipation 
22
of the potential future industrial uses of thorium, includ-
23
ing energy, because— 
24
02:00 Sep 21, 2019
H4410
4 
•HR 4410 IH
(1) thorium has a mineralogical association 
1
with valuable rare earth elements; 
2
(2) there is a great need to develop domestic re-
3
fining capacity to process domestic rare earth ele-
4
ment deposits; and 
5
(3) the economy of the United States would 
6
benefit from the rapid development and control of 
7
intellectual property relating to the commercial de-
8
velopment of technology utilizing thorium.
