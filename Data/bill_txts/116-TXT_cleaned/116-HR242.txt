RESOLUTION 
Affirming the importance of the Orphan Drug Act, cele-
brating the over 750 new orphan therapies approved 
since its creation, and recognizing the need to continue 
supporting research and development for rare diseases. 
Whereas 30 million people in the United States, or nearly one 
out of every 10 individuals in the United States, lives 
with at least one of more than 7,000 known rare dis-
eases; 
Whereas the Orphan Drug Act (Public Law 97–414) was en-
acted to provide research and development incentives to 
encourage the development of new therapies for diseases 
affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the United States;

Whereas in the 10 years prior to enactment of such Act, only 
10 therapies for rare diseases were developed by private 
industry and approved by the Food and Drug Adminis-
tration; 
Whereas since enactment of such Act, research and develop-
ment of therapies addressing rare diseases has resulted 
in more than 750 new therapies for rare diseases; 
Whereas experts estimate that without the tax credit under 
section 45C of the Internal Revenue Code (relating to a 
tax credit for clinical testing expenses for certain drugs 
for rare diseases or conditions), one of the incentives for 
innovation established in the Orphan Drug Act (Public 
Law 97–414), at least one-third of such new therapies 
would likely not have been developed; 
Whereas the Orphan Drug Act (Public Law 97–414) con-
tinues to lead to increased research and successful thera-
peutic development along the full range of rare diseases; 
Whereas people with rare diseases benefit from new orphan 
drugs by having a longer life and a higher quality of life; 
Whereas society benefits from new orphan drugs through in-
creased productivity from individuals affected by rare dis-
eases as well as a potential decline in the resources de-
voted to health care, disability, caregiving, and related 
spending with respect to those individuals; 
Whereas despite the success of the Orphan Drug Act (Public 
Law 97–414), fewer than 10 percent of the more than 
7,000 identified rare diseases have at least one treatment 
option that is approved by the Food and Drug Adminis-
tration; and

should be recognized: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) applauds the tremendous growth in research

5
Drug Administration; 
6
(2) recognizes that significant research and de-
7
velopment efforts and related investments are need-
8
ed to develop therapies to treat and cure the thou-

10
tions are currently available; and 
11
(3) affirms the need to continue supporting 
12
public investment and encouraging private invest-
13
ment in research and development of new treatments 
14
for rare diseases.
