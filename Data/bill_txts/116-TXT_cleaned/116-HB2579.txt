partners during the scoping stage as described in section 
10
203. The agency shall include sufficient supporting docu-
11
mentation to the extent permitted by law and within avail-
12
able funds to enable any reviewing parties to understand

that withdrew from the process. At a minimum, the docu-
21
ment shall go to the Tribal leader and all members of any

10
decision letter, signed by the head of the agency. The let-
11
ter shall state the decision to proceed or not proceed with 
12
the mineral activity, the decision’s rationale, any changes 
13
in the proposal made in response to comments, and any 
14
points where the decision conflicts with the expressed re-
15
quests of any of the affected Indian Tribes. It shall par-
16
ticularly address why the decision was made to disregard 
17
any such requests. The agency shall mail and, if possible,

email a copy of the letter to all affected Indian Tribal Gov-
19
ernments, including those that withdrew from the process.

SEC. 205. DOCUMENTATION AND REPORTING. 
6
(a) OFFICIAL CONSULTATION RECORD.—The agency 
7
shall keep an official consultation record that allows accu-
8
rate tracking of the process so that agencies and con-
9
sulting parties can correct any errors or omissions, and 
10
provides an official record of the process that can be re-
11
ferred to in any litigation that may arise. The agency shall 
12
document all efforts to initiate consultation as well as doc-
13
umenting the process once it has begun. Such documenta-
14
tion, including correspondence, telephone logs, and emails, 
15
shall be included in the agency’s official consultation 
16
record. The agency shall also keep notes so that the con-
17

04:44 May 17, 2019
H2579
79 
•HR 2579 IH
(1) A determination that reclamation or res-
1
toration covered by the financial assurance has been

8
(f) RELEASE SCHEDULE.—The release referred to in 
9
subsection (e) shall be according to the following schedule: 
10
(1) After the operator has completed any re-
11
quired backfilling, regrading, and drainage control of 
12
an area subject to mineral activities and covered by 
13
the financial assurance, and has commenced revege-
14
tation on the regraded areas subject to mineral ac-
15
tivities in accordance with the approved plan, that 
16
portion of the total financial assurance secured for 
17
the area subject to mineral activities attributable to 
18
the completed activities may be released except that 
19
sufficient assurance must be retained to address 
20
other required reclamation and restoration needs 
21
and to assure the long-term success of the revegeta-
22
tion. 
23
(2) After the operator has completed success-
24
fully all remaining mineral activities and reclamation

9
(g) EFFLUENT.—Notwithstanding section 307(b)(4), 
10
where any discharge or other water-related condition re-
11
sulting from the mineral activities requires treatment in 
12
order to meet the applicable effluent limitations and water 
13
quality standards, the financial assurance shall include the 
14
estimated cost of maintaining such treatment for the pro-
15
jected period that will be needed after the cessation of 
16
mineral activities. The portion of the financial assurance 
17
attributable to such estimated cost of treatment shall not 
18
be released until the discharge has ceased for a period of 
19
5 years, as determined by ongoing monitoring and testing, 
20
or, if the discharge continues, until the operator has met 
21
all applicable effluent limitations and water quality stand-
22
ards for 5 full years without treatment.

fulfilled in fact at the time of release, such Secretary shall 
4
issue an order under section 606 requiring the claim hold-
5
er or operator (or any person who controls the claim hold-
6
er or operator) to correct the condition such that applica-
7
