A BILL 
To direct the Secretary of State, in consultation with the 
Secretary of Health and Human Services, to submit a 
report on the actions of the World Health Organization 
to address the spread of the virus responsible for 
COVID–19, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. FINDINGS. 
3
Congress finds the following: 
4
(1) On December 30, 2019, Dr. Li Wenliang of 
5
Wuhan, China warned the Chinese medical commu-

nity of the outbreak of the virus responsible for 
1
COVID–19. 
2
(2) Four days after warning the Chinese med-
3
ical community, the Chinese Public Security Bureau 
4
forced Dr. Li Wenliang to sign a letter admitting 
5
that he made ‘‘false comments’’ and that he had 
6
‘‘severely disturbed the social order’’. 
7
(3) Chinese authorities suppressed information 
8
concerning the spread of such virus by censoring 
9
certain keywords on Chinese messaging applications. 
10
(4) On January 14, 2020, the World Health 
11
Organization tweeted that ‘‘preliminary investiga-
12
tions conducted by Chinese authorities have found 
13
no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission 
14
of COVID–19 in Wuhan, China’’. 
15
(5) The virus was later determined to be highly 
16
contagious and spread through human-to-human 
17
contact. 
18
(6) Public health researchers have found incon-
19
sistencies in the data reported by the World Health 
20
Organization in their situation reports and that the 
21
World Health Organization has failed to address 
22
such inconsistences. 
23
(7) In the middle of the month of January 
24
2020, the World Health Organization refused to de-

clare a public health emergency as they did not want 
1
to ‘‘spook the world further’’. 
2
(8) On February 3, 2020, despite warning signs 
3
of an ongoing cover-up, the Director General of the 
4
World 
Health 
Organization, 
Tedros 
Adhanom 
5
Ghebreyesus, praised the People’s Republic of China 
6
saying he was ‘‘impressed’’ by President Xi’s leader-
7
ship. 
8
(9) Senior World Health Organization officials 
9
praised the People’s Republic of China’s response to 
10
the spread of the virus noting that the ‘‘Chinese peo-
11
ple feel protected’’. 
12
(10) There is a longstanding and concerning re-
13
lationship between the World Health Organization 
14
and the People’s Republic of China, as the People’s 
15
Republic of China co-chaired the China-Africa 
16
Health Ministers Conference, hosted the Belt and 
17
Road Forum for International Cooperation, and 
18
worked together with the World Health Organization 
19
for the ‘‘One Belt, One Road’’ initiative. 
20
(11) In 2017, the People’s Republic of China 
21
worked ‘‘tirelessly behind the scenes’’ to ensure the 
22
election of Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus as Direc-
23
tor General of the World Health Organization. 
24

•HR 6665 IH
(12) In 2014, while serving as Health Minister 
1
in Ethiopia, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus covered 
2
up three cholera outbreaks in Ethiopia. 
3
(13) In 2017, leaked emails revealed that the 
4
World Health Organization refused to classify ebola 
5
outbreak as a public health emergency for over two 
6
months as to not ‘‘anger’’ the leaders of African 
7
countries. 
8
(14) The United States is the largest financial 
9
contributor to the World Health Organization, pro-
10
viding the organization with up to $500 million in 
11
American taxpayer money every year. 
12
(15) If the World Health Organization had 
13
been truthful concerning the spread of the virus, the 
14
international community could have better prepared 
15
to combat such spread.
