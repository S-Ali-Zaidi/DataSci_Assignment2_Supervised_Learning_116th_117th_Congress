RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives regard-
ing United States efforts to promote peace and stability 
in the Gulf region between and among United States 
allies. 
Whereas the United States maintains a strategic alliance with 
numerous countries located in the Gulf region and spe-
cifically enjoys a strong relationship and partnership with 
the member nations of the Gulf Cooperative Council 
(GCC); 
Whereas the GCC is a regional political and economic union 
consisting of its member states of Bahrain, Kuwait, 
Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emir-
ates (UAE) formally established by the Charter of the 
Gulf Cooperation Council on May 25, 1981;

•HRES 482 IH 
Whereas the United States respects the state sovereignty of 
all member states in the GCC; 
Whereas the GCC has been a stabilizing force since 1981 in 
the aftermath of the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran and 
the turbulence following the outbreak of the Iran-Iraq 
War in 1980; 
Whereas the founding charter of the GCC emphasized the in-
tegration and interconnection of economics, education, 
and culture among members designed to respond to con-
cerns that Iran would emerge as a political, ideological, 
and economic power; 
Whereas, on June 5, 2017, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain, and 
Egypt officially cut diplomatic ties with Qatar, a member 
state of the GCC, resulting in a cessation of diplomatic 
relations, closed borders and airspace with Qatar, and a 
blockade that has now stretched longer than one year, 
and creating increased tensions between members of the 
GCC, as well as with other United States allies in the re-
gion; 
Whereas Qatar’s isolation by these countries has created a 
diplomatic crisis in the Gulf region challenging the unity 
of nations that comprise the GCC, as well as the security 
of the entire region; 
Whereas, on January 13, 2019, Secretary of State Mike 
Pompeo stated that the ‘‘rift between Qatar and its Gulf 
neighbors had gone on for too long and was threatening 
regional unity needed to counter Iran’’; 
Whereas Secretary Pompeo also noted that ‘‘Gulf unity was 
essential for a planned Middle East Strategic Alliance 
(MESA) that would also include Jordan and Egypt’’;

•HRES 482 IH 
Whereas a key component of the United States military strat-
egy in the Gulf is the maintenance of a United States 
military presence in the region with United States Armed 
Forces stationed at various Gulf state facilities that the 
United States has access to, in accordance with Defense 
Cooperation Agreements between the United States and 
these countries; 
Whereas Al-Udeid Air Base has allowed the United States to 
use strategic assets to counter ISIS, command and con-
trol United States air power in the region, and conduct 
missions integral to addressing conflicts in Yemen, Syria, 
Iraq, Afghanistan, and over 15 other nations; 
Whereas, on January 14, 2019, Secretary Pompeo signed a 
memorandum of understanding with Qatar regarding the 
expansion and renovation of Al-Udeid Air Base, which 
hosts the forward headquarters of the United States mili-
tary’s Central Command and some 10,000 American 
troops; 
Whereas the ability of ISIS and other terrorist groups to 
maintain influence in the Gulf runs counter to the na-
tional security objectives of the United States, the GCC, 
and the entire region; 
Whereas the President of the United States has recognized 
the importance of regional cooperation and a united GCC 
to mitigate regional threats and ensure the region’s eco-
nomic prosperity, counter Iranian destabilizing activities, 
and defeat terrorists and extremists; 
Whereas, on April 23, 2017, United States Ambassador to 
Kuwait Lawrence Silverman stated that President Trump 
was eager to find a ‘‘quick and final’’ solution to the Gulf 
crisis, and Kuwait’s Foreign Minister Khaled al-Jarallah

said, ‘‘Kuwait and the Gulf countries were determined to 
solve the crisis’’; 
Whereas the Government of Kuwait has led GCC efforts to 
resolve the crisis and has historically called for regional 
solidarity and diplomatic solutions to regional conflicts; 
Whereas the Trump administration has sought to negotiate 
a peaceful resolution to the crisis by hosting visits by sev-
eral Gulf leaders including that of Qatar in March and 
April 2018 and other nations in the region, to mediate 
a resolution of the dispute; 
Whereas a prolonged rift between our allies in the region 
threatens efforts to counter Iran and regional terrorist 
groups; 
Whereas the lengthy blockade has exacted an untold humani-
tarian cost on all the people of the region, long-term 
damage to the GCC’s economic and financial integration, 
and considerable harm to the region’s social bonds and 
cultural fabric; and 
Whereas the blockade of Qatar has undermined the Middle 
East’s stability and the United States has a significant 
national security interest in the stability and economic 
prosperity of the Gulf: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) reaffirms its appreciation to the Govern-
2
ment of Kuwait for the efforts they have made in 
3
trying to facilitate mediation between the Gulf Coop-
4
erative Council (GCC) and its member states; 
5
(2) reaffirms its support for the GCC and its

member states as allies and partners in combatting

terrorism and promoting stability and prosperity in

(3) reaffirms United States policy toward the

GCC and our allies, which has remained consistent

for decades, that a united Gulf is in the best inter-

(4) encourages President Trump and the Sec-

retary of State to use all efforts at their disposal to

resolve the current crisis peacefully in a manner that

is consistent with United States policy in the region

and will be enduring and enforceable, by initiating a 
11
serious mediation effort with GCC members and 
12
Egypt, including the possibility of hosting a summit 
13
among the GCC, Egypt, and the United States.
