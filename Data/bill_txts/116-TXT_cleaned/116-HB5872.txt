•HR 5872 IH
(1) The United States Armed Forces is the 
1
largest, all-volunteer military force in the world, yet 
2
less than one percent of the American population 
3
serves in the Armed Forces. 
4
(2) Each branch of the Armed Forces (Army, 
5
Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard) in-
6
stills in its members a sense of duty and obligation 
7
to the United States, their branch of service, and 
8
their comrades-in-arms. 
9
(3) The Department of Veterans Affairs esti-
10
mates that approximately 20 veterans of the Armed 
11
Forces commit suicide each day and a veteran’s risk 
12
of suicide is 21 percent higher compared to an adult 
13
who has not served in the Armed Forces. 
14
(4) The Department of Veterans Affairs is ag-
15
gressively undertaking measures to prevent these 
16
tragic outcomes, yet suicide rates among veterans 
17
remain unacceptably high. 
18
(5) Upon enlistment or appointment in the 
19
Armed Forces, a new member is obligated to take an 
20
oath of office or oath of enlistment. 
21
(6) Most members of the Armed Forces view 
22
this oath not as an imposition, but as a promise that 
23
they are bound to fulfill.
