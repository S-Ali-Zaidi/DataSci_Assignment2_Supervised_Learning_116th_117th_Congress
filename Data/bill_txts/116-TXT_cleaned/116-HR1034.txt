RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the need for a Senior Security Promise. 
Whereas after a lifetime of hard work, older Americans have 
earned the right to age with dignity and enjoy the fruits 
of their labor; 
Whereas over the past century, life expectancy has increased 
for many Americans, and the share of the population 
over age 65 has grown dramatically— 
(1) from 1900 through 2015, the percentage of peo-
ple in the United States age 65 and older more than tri-
pling; 
(2) according to the Administration on Aging, in 
2015, those 65 and older accounting for about 15 percent 
of the total population, or 50,900,000 individuals; and

(3) by 2085, those 65 and older are projected to 
make up about 22 percent of the total United States pop-
ulation; 
Whereas older Americans have paid into critical programs 
like Social Security and Medicare their entire working 
lives; 
Whereas the Federal Government should work to strengthen 
and protect these critical programs, ensure the trust 
funds are solvent for years to come, require higher in-
come earners to pay their fair share, and protect the 
safety net for older Americans; 
Whereas many older Americans on fixed incomes are strug-
gling to keep up with the skyrocketing prices costs of 
premiums and out of pocket costs of prescription drugs; 
Whereas access to affordable and reliable health care is a top 
priority for our Nation’s older Americans; 
Whereas scams and fraudulent activities calls are more than 
an annoyance, they can mean serious financial risks for 
older people; 
Whereas family caregivers allow older Americans to age with 
dignity in their homes, and the Federal Government 
should recognize the value of caregivers and provide more 
financial support; 
Whereas older Americans play an integral role in the labor 
force of the Nation, with 10,000,000 seniors working or 
actively seeking to work— 
(1) according to the Administration for Community 
Living in 2018, with 10,000,000 (19.6 percent) Ameri-
cans age 65 and over in the labor force (working or ac-
tively seeking work), including 5,500,000 men (24.0 per-
cent) and 4,500,000 women (15.9 percent); and

(2) in 2018 older adults constituting 6.2 percent of 
the United States labor force; 
Whereas older Americans are a vital part of the American 
workforce and our economy— 
(1) at the Federal level, people age 50 and older 
contributing 43 percent of the total tax take in 2018, or 
a little over $1,400,000,000,000; 
(2) an estimated seniors to provide 47 percent of 
total 
Federal 
tax 
revenue 
by 
2050, 
or 
$5,800,000,000,000; and 
(3) by some estimates in 2018, people 50 and older 
spending 56 cents out of every retail dollar spent, by 
2050, spending 61 cents of every dollar; 
Whereas for older Americans who want to keep working, age 
discrimination threatens their financial security, an esti-
mated 6-in-10 older workers across the Nation having ex-
perienced or seen age discrimination in the workplace; 
Whereas older Americans touch the lives of many through 
countless hours of volunteering or unpaid work, individ-
uals 50 and older creating an estimated additional 
$745,000,000,000 in value through unpaid activities, 
such as volunteering and family caregiving; 
Whereas older Americans are the cornerstones of American 
families, with 12,900,000 households led by people that 
are age 75 and older; and 
Whereas older Americans are a valued part of American life 
not only for their contributions, but also their wisdom 
and experience: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-

resentatives that—
