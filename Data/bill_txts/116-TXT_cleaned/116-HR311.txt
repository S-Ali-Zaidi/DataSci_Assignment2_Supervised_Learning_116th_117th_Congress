memorative stamp in honor of the 150th anniversary

founded on April 13, 1870, by civic leaders, artists, busi-
nessmen, collectors, and philanthropists for the express 
purpose of bringing art and art education to the Amer-
ican people;

Whereas conservation, preservation, and research has always 
been central to The Met’s mission, and the museum now 
houses centers dedicated to the conservation of objects, 
paintings, paper, photographs, textiles, clothing, and 
other media in the museum’s collection, ensuring that 
these treasures remain accessible to generations of visi-
tors;

resources for millions of Americans through tours, inter-

Whereas The Met has made it a priority to bring art to 
Americans of all ages and developed the MetFamilies and
