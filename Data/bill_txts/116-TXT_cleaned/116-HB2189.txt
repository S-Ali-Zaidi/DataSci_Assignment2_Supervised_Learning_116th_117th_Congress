A BILL 
To require the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the 
Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration, to establish a constituent-driven program 
to provide a digital information platform capable of effi-
ciently integrating coastal data with decision-support 
tools, training, and best practices and to support collec-
tion of priority coastal geospatial data to inform and 
improve local, State, regional, and Federal capacities to 
manage the coastal region, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress makes the following findings: 
4
(1) The Digital Coast is a model approach for 
5
effective Federal partnerships with State and local 
6
government, nongovernmental organizations, and the 
7
private sector. 
8
(2) Access to current, accurate, uniform, and 
9
standards-based geospatial information, tools, and 
10
training to characterize the United States coastal re-
11
gion is critical for public safety and for the environ-
12
ment, infrastructure, and economy of the United 
13
States. 
14
(3) More than half of all people of the United 
15
States (153,000,000) currently live on or near a 
16
coast and an additional 12,000,000 are expected in 
17
the next decade. 
18
(4) Coastal counties in the United States aver-
19
age 300 persons per square mile, compared with the 
20
national average of 98. 
21
(5) On a typical day, more than 1,540 permits 
22
for construction of single-family homes are issued in 
23
coastal counties, combined with other commercial, 
24
retail, and institutional construction to support this 
25
population.

(6) Over half of the economic productivity of 
1
the United States is located within coastal regions. 
2
(7) Highly accurate, high-resolution remote 
3
sensing and other geospatial data play an increas-
4
ingly important role in decision making and manage-
5
ment of the coastal zone and economy, including 
6
for— 
7
(A) flood and coastal storm surge pre-
8
diction;

(B) hazard risk and vulnerability assess-
10
ment; 
11
