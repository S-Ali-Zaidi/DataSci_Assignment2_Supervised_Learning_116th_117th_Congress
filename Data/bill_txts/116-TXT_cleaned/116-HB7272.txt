4
(3) In August of 1955, Emmett Till traveled to 
5
Tallahatchie County, Mississippi, to visit his great 
6
uncle, Moses Wright. 
7
(4) Before Emmett Till traveled to Tallahatchie 
8
County, Mamie Till-Mobley cautioned him about the 
9
dangers of the segregated South, instructing him to 
10
‘‘be very careful . . . humble himself to the extent 
11
of getting down on his knees’’. 
12
(5) When purchasing bubble gum in Money, 
13
Mississippi, Emmett Till was falsely accused of flirt-
14
ing with shopkeeper Carolyn Bryant, who would ac-
15
knowledge that her own claims were false in 2017. 
16
(6) Emmett Till was abducted at gunpoint from 
17
Moses Wright’s home by Roy Bryant and J.W. 
18
Milam on August 28, 1955. 
19

20
and J.W. Milam beat, tortured, and killed Emmett

tured that it was only recognizable from his father’s 
1
ring on his finger. 
2
(9) When Emmett Till’s body was recovered, 
3
his ear was found torn, his eye was displaced, his 
4
teeth were missing, and the iron cotton gin fan used 
5
in his murder was still attached to his corpse. 
6
(10) On September 2, 1955, Mamie Till-Mobley 
7
received her son’s casket at the Illinois Central Ter-
8
minal, falling in grief at its sight. 
9
(11) Mamie Till-Mobley demonstrated exem-
10
plary bravery, requesting an open-casket funeral for 
11
her son, because in her words, ‘‘everybody needed to 
12
know what had happened to Emmett Till’’. 
13
(12) Over a four-day period, over 50,000 visi-
14
tors viewed Emmett Till’s body at the Roberts Tem-
15
ple Church of God in Christ. 
16
(13) The horror and grief caused across the 
17

Emmet Till’s body helped spark the civil rights 
19

21
scribe Emmett Till’s open-casket funeral as the 
22
‘‘big-bang’’ of the civil rights movement. 
23
(15) Emmett Till was laid to rest at Burr Oak 
24
Cemetery on September 6, 1955, in Alsip, Illinois.

3
Till’s killers in open court.

5
minutes, arriving at their preposterous verdict to ac-
6
