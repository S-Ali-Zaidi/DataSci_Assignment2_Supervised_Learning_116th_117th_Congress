down of the Federal Government that began on De-
1
cember 22, 2018; 
2
(2) the negative impact the shutdown is having 
3

(3) financial institutions and other companies, 
11

engaged in the production of consumer scores should 
13
provide opportunities for consumers affected by the 
14
shutdown—including Federal employees, government 
15
contractors, small businesses, and other individ-
16
uals—who are or will be facing financial distress to 
17
easily contact and alert them of their situation im-

due to the temporary delay or permanent loss of

4
fees as well as ceasing foreclosures and providing 
5
forbearance for the duration of the shutdown, in

impaired because of the shutdown; 
12
(7) financial institutions and other companies, 
13
such as consumer reporting agencies and companies 
14
engaged in the production of consumer scores, 
15
should take steps to prevent adverse information 
16
being reported and utilized in any manner that 
17
harms affected consumers, including by preventing 
18
modified credit arrangements intended to help con-
19
sumers fulfill their financial obligations from being 
20
reported to, and coded by, consumer reporting agen-
21
cies on a person’s credit report in a manner that 
22
hurts the creditworthiness of the affected consumers;

ly to identify their customers who have been affected

and adopt flexible, prudent arrangements to help

such customers meet their debt and other obliga-

tions; and
