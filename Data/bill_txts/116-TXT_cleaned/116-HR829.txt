RESOLUTION 
Acknowledging the history and lasting impact of the Federal 
Government-created problem of redlining and the respon-
sibility of the Federal Government to address such im-
pact. 
Whereas access to opportunity plays a fundamental role in 
determining the prospects of an individual with respect to 
achieving upward mobility and the American Dream; 
Whereas where an individual lives plays an outsized role in 
determining the access of such individual to life-altering 
opportunities, such as finding a well-paying job and 
avoiding illnesses caused by environmental factors;

Whereas a persistent wealth gap exists in the United States 
between the wealthy and the vast majority of Americans, 
a gap that particularly impacts communities of color; 
Whereas a lack of wealth increases the vulnerability of a fam-
ily to socioeconomic emergencies, such as health-related 
emergencies that can cause financial ruin; 
Whereas an income gap only explains a small portion of the 
racial wealth gap; 
Whereas housing, as the most common household asset and 
largest source of private wealth, is the largest driver of 
the racial wealth gap; 
Whereas Federal Government redlining provided the financial 
foundation and legal impetus for the racially discrimina-
tory housing practices principally responsible for a dis-
parity in housing wealth; 
Whereas redlining used the authority of the Federal Govern-
ment and leveraged the borrowing power of that Govern-
ment to reinforce racially discriminatory incentive struc-
tures in the housing market that substantially contrib-
uted to the persistent segregation still seen today; 
Whereas segregation creates an additional barrier to upward 
mobility for minority communities by concentrating dis-
advantage regardless of income; 
Whereas neighborhoods with high concentrations of Jews and 
immigrants from Ireland, Italy, Poland, and other East-
ern European countries were also redlined, creating a 
multiethnic diaspora of the intentionally marginalized; 
Whereas the financial crisis of 2007 and 2008 exacerbated 
the racial wealth gap;

•HRES 829 IH 
Whereas intentionally malicious and racially motivated lend-
ing practices by large financial institutions directly re-
sulted in the widening of the racial wealth gap in the 
ruthless pursuit of profits; 
Whereas efforts to incentivize the private sector to lend to the 
victims of redlining and historically financially under-
served areas have failed to generate the private lending 
necessary to close the wealth gap or address disparate ac-
cess to credit; and 
Whereas the Trump administration seeks to undermine the 
already weak incentive structure that pushes financial in-
stitutions to lend to the victims of redlining: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives acknowl-

(1) the history and lasting impact of the Fed-

(2) that the Federal Government has a respon-
