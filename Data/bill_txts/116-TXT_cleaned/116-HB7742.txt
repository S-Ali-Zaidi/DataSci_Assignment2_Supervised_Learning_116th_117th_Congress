A BILL 
To require the Attorney General to report on potential viola-
tions of Bill of Rights during the COVID-19 pandemic, 
and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Defending Freedom 
4
Act of 2020’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
The Congress finds as follows: 
7
(1) The United States of America was founded 
8
to secure individual liberties and its powers are de-
9
rived from the consent of the governed.

(2) In the reaction to the COVID-19 outbreak, 
1
many government officials have used the state of 
2
emergency to unjustly, and often undemocratically, 
3
limit the liberty of their citizens. 
4
(3) Article IV section 4 of the United States 
5
Constitution guarantees the American people a re-
6
publican form of government and the prolonged use 
7
of executive decrees without legislative authorization 
8
will constitute a breach of that guarantee. 
9
(4) The due process clause of the Fourteenth 
10
Amendment prohibits any State from violating the 
11
Bill of Rights. 
12
(5) The First Amendment establishes protec-
13
tions for the free exercise of religion, the right to as-
14
semble, and freedom of speech. 
15
(6) Numerous local governments around the 
16
country have restricted the free exercise of religion 
17
by mandating closures of church buildings and drive- 
18
in church services. 
19
(7) Certain government officials have restricted 
20
the right of individuals to assemble in public places 
21
and government buildings. 
22
(8) On April 6, in the Commonwealth of Puerto 
23
Rico, Governor Wanda Va´zquez signed an Executive 
24
order making it illegal for media outlets or social 
25

media accounts ‘‘to transmit or allow the trans-
1
mission’’ of ‘‘false information’’ relating to govern-
2
ment proclamations or Executive orders concerning 
3
COVID-19 or other disasters. 
4
(9) The Second Amendment establishes that the 
5
right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not 
6
be infringed. 
7
(10) States demanded the closure of federally 
8
licensed firearms dealers, stripping citizens of Sec-
9
ond Amendment rights without due process. 
10
(11) Local governments are considering access-
11
ing Bluetooth and GPS cellular device data, which 
12
compromises the American right to privacy and the 
13
sanctity of our homes. This is possible because all 
14
bank accounts, new vehicles, and FCC regulated de-
15
vices have embedded government surveillance. The 
16
government is ever-present, in violation of the Third 
17
Amendment. 
18
(12) The Fourth Amendment guarantees the 
19
right of the people to be secure in their persons, 
20
houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable 
21
searches and seizures. 
22
(13) Numerous State governors have issued or-
23
ders to stop and search vehicles based on an Ameri-
24

can’s State of residence, rather than the probable 
1
cause standard required by the Fourth Amendment. 
2
(14) Private-sector telecommunications compa-
3
nies have the capability to track the location of 
4
American citizens and share that information with 
5
government officials without a warrant issued upon 
6
probable cause of a crime. 
7
(15) The Fifth Amendment ensures that Ameri-
8
cans will not be deprived of life, liberty, or property, 
9
without due process of law. 
10
(16) Forty-two states have issued stay-at-home 
11
orders or lockdowns which have deprived Americans 
12
of their economic liberty without due process. 
13
(17) Forcibly shutting down businesses denies 
14
business owners the economically viable use of their 
15
property and therefore constitutes a ‘‘taking’’ under 
16
the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. 
17
(18) The Sixth amendment protects our right 
18
to a speedy and public trial. 
19
(19) On March 21, 2020, it was reported that 
20
the Department of Justice requested the ability to 
21
pause court proceedings ‘‘whenever the district court 
22
is fully or partially closed by virtue of any natural 
23
disaster, civil disobedience, or other emergency situa-
24
tion.’’, thereby preventing speedy trials.
