•HR 8249 IH
(1) The 24th amendment to the Constitution of 
1
the United States prohibits Congress and States 
2
conditioning the right to vote in Federal elections on 
3
payment of any poll tax or any other tax, and this 
4
prohibition was extended to States under the 14th 
5
amendment in 1964 in Harper v. Virginia Board of 
6
Elections. 
7
(2) The right to vote is the most basic constitu-
8
tive act of citizenship. Regaining the right to vote 
9
reintegrates individuals with criminal convictions 
10
into free society, helping to enhance public safety. 
11
(3) An estimated 6,100,000 citizens of the 
12
United States, or about 1 in 40 adults in the United 
13
States, currently cannot vote as a result of a felony 
14
conviction. As of 2016, an estimated 6,100,000 citi-
15
zens, or about 1 in 40 adults in the United States, 
16
could not vote as a result of a felony convictions. 
17
(4) At least 8 States explicitly prohibit individ-
18
uals who owe money associated with their criminal 
19
convictions from voting. At least 22 other States 
20
have laws that can implicitly prohibit individuals 
21
from voting because of unpaid legal debts, either 
22
through requirements that individuals complete pa-
23
role or probation, which themselves hinge on pay-

ment of fines, fees or restitution, or clemency re-
1
strictions based on unpaid legal debts. 
2
(5) Across the Nation, approximately 10 million 
3
individuals owe a collective $50 billion in debt re-
4
lated to the criminal justice system, and findings 
5
from 14 States show that families on average owe 
6
$13,600 in fees and fines. 
7
(6) State disenfranchisement laws additionally 
8
disproportionately impact racial and ethnic minori-
9
ties. 
10
(7) The right to vote additionally may not be 
11
abridged or denied by the United States or by any 
12
State on account of race, color, gender, or previous 
13
condition of servitude. The 13th, 14th, 15th, 19th, 
14
and 26th Amendments to the Constitution of the 
15
United States empower Congress to enact measures 
16
to protect the right to vote. 
17
(8) Continuing to disenfranchise individuals 
18
who have outstanding fees, fines, and restitution and 
19
who are living and working in the community serves 
20
no State interest and hinders their rehabilitation 
21
and reintegration into society.
