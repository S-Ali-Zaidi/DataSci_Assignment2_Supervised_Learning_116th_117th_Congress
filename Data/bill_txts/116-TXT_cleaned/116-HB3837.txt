A BILL 
To establish the National Fab Lab Network, a federally 
chartered organization consisting of a national network 
of local digital fabrication facilities providing universal 
access to advanced manufacturing tools for workforce 
development, STEM education, developing inventions, 
creating businesses, producing personalized products, 
mitigating risks, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘National Fab Lab Net-
2
work Act of 2019’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) Scientific discoveries and technical innova-
6
tions are critical to the economic and national secu-
7
rity of the United States. 
8
(2) Maintaining the leadership of the United 
9
States in science, technology, engineering, and math-
10
ematics will require a diverse population with the 
11
skills, interest, and access to tools required to ad-
12
vance these fields. 
13
(3) Just as earlier digital revolutions in commu-
14
nications and computation provided individuals with 
15
the internet and personal computers, a digital revo-
16
lution in fabrication will allow anyone to make al-
17
most anything, anywhere. 
18
(4) These creations include elements of a typ-
19
ical household basket of goods (furnishings, apparel, 
20
food production equipment, shelter, transportation, 
21
education and communication, recreation, and other 
22
goods and services), personal technology, means for 
23
personal expression, the production of digital fab-
24
rication machinery, community design, and manufac-
25
turing capability.

(5) The Center for Bits and Atoms of the Mas-
1
sachusetts Institute of Technology (CBA) has con-
2
tributed significantly to the advancement of these 
3
goals through its work in creating and advancing 
4
digital fabrication facilities, or ‘‘fab labs’’ in the 
5
United States and abroad. 
6
(6) Such digital fabrication facilities may in-
7
clude MakerSpaces, Hackerspaces, and other cre-
8
ative spaces that use digital fabrication as a plat-
9
form for education, innovation, entrepreneurship, 
10
personal expression, public access, and social impact. 
11
(7) Such digital fabrication facilities provide a 
12
model for a new kind of national laboratory that op-
13
erates as a network, linking local facilities for ad-
14
vanced manufacturing, providing universal access, 
15
cultivating new literacies, and empowering commu-
16
nities. 
17
(8) The nonprofit Fab Foundation was estab-
18
lished to support the growth of the international net-
19
work of digital fabrication facilities, to amplify the 
20
educational, entrepreneurial, and social impacts of 
21
digital fabrication facilities, and to support the de-
22
velopment of regional capacity building organizations 
23
to broaden impact as well as address local, regional,

and global challenges through the use of digital fab-
1
rication technologies. 
2
(9) A coordinated array of national public-pri-
3
vate partnerships will be the most effective way to 
4
accelerate the provision of universal access to this 
5
infrastructure for workforce development, science, 
6
technology, engineering, and mathematics education, 
7
developing inventions, creating businesses, producing 
8
personalized products, and mitigating risks.
