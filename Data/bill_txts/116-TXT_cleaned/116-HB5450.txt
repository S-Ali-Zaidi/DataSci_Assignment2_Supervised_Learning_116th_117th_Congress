A BILL 
To amend title 51, United States Code, to require a National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration initiative on re-
duction of greenhouse gas emissions and noise emissions 
from aircraft, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Cleaner, Quieter Air-
4
planes Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress makes the following findings: 
2
(1) Air travel currently contributes approxi-
3
mately 3 percent to global carbon emissions, but 
4
emissions from this sector are expected to triple by 
5
2050. 
6
(2) A healthy, thriving aviation sector contrib-
7
utes to the quality of life and economic well-being of 
8
the United States. In 2014, the Federal Aviation 
9
Administration found that civil aviation accounted 
10
for 5.1 percent of the United States gross domestic 
11
product, generated $1.6 trillion, and supported 
12
10,600,000 jobs. 
13
(3) Existing aircraft technologies contribute to 
14
noise pollution that has adverse impacts on the qual-
15
ity of life in affected communities. As air traffic vol-
16
umes increase and the adoption of performance- 
17
based navigation technology proceeds, the problem of 
18
noise pollution is becoming more severe in some 
19
areas. 
20
(4) The United States has adopted a goal of 
21
carbon-neutral growth in aviation from 2020. 
22
(5) Research on technologies to lessen the envi-
23
ronmental and noise impacts of aviation is ongoing, 
24
but should accelerate, and should include work on 
25
the further maturation and integration of multiple

TION INITIATIVE ON REDUCTION OF GREEN-

HOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND NOISE EMIS-
5
SIONS FROM AIRCRAFT. 
6
(a) INITIATIVE REQUIRED.—Section 40112 of title 
7
51, United States Code, is amended— 
8
(1) by redesignating subsections (b) through (e) 
9
as subsections (c) through (f), respectively; and 
10
(2) by inserting after subsection (a) the fol-
11
lowing new subsection (b): 
12
‘‘(b) TECHNOLOGIES FOR GREENHOUSE GAS EMIS-
13
SIONS AND NOISE EMISSIONS REDUCTION.— 
14
‘‘(1) INITIATIVE
REQUIRED.—The Adminis-
15
trator shall establish an initiative to build upon and 
16
accelerate previous or ongoing work to develop and 
17
demonstrate new technologies, including systems ar-
18
chitecture, components, or integration of systems 
19
and airframe structures, in aircraft concepts that 
20
are capable of reducing both greenhouse gas emis-
21
sions and noise emissions from aircraft by at least 
22
50 percent compared to the highest-performing air-
23
craft technologies in service as of December 31, 
24
2019, with the goal of deploying new technologies

developed pursuant to the initiative on regional 
1
transport aircraft intended to enter into service by 
2
2030 and on single-aisle aircraft designed to accom-
3
modate more than 125 passengers intended to enter 
4
into service by 2040. 
5
‘‘(2) APPROACH.—In carrying out the initiative, 
6
the Administrator shall do the following: 
7
‘‘(A) Continue and expand work of the Ad-
8
ministration on research, development, and 
9
demonstration of aircraft concepts described in 
10
paragraph (1), and the integration of related 
11
advanced technologies and concepts, with the 
12
goal of carrying out test flights by 2025. 
13
‘‘(B) To the extent practicable, work with 
14
multiple partner organizations, including cur-
15
rent commercial production aircraft providers 
16
and small businesses and new entrants, on re-
17
search and development activities related to 
18
both regional transport aircraft and aircraft de-
19
signed to accommodate more than 125 pas-
20
sengers in order to achieve an industry-wide 
21
shift towards aircraft concepts for the reduction 
22
of greenhouse gas emissions and noise emis-
23
sions.

‘‘(C) Provide guidance to the Federal Avia-
1
tion Administration (FAA) on technologies de-
2
veloped and tested pursuant to the initiative in 
3
order to assist the work of the Federal Aviation 
4
Administration to identify new requirements for 
5
policy, infrastructure, and administrative capac-
6
ity necessary to enable the safe deployment of 
7
such technologies on transport category air-
8
craft.’’.

(b) REPORTS.—Not later than 180 days after the 
10
date of the enactment of this Act and annually thereafter, 
11
the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space 
12
Administration shall submit to Congress a report on the

Code (as amended by subsection (a) of this section), in-
16
cluding a description of any perceived obstacles to achiev-

ing the goal of a 50-percent reduction in both greenhouse 
18
gas emissions and noise emissions from aircraft as con-
19
templated for the initiative.
