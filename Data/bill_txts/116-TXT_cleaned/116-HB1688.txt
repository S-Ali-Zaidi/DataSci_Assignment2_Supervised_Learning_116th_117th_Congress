(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:

•HR 1688 IH
(1) Nontribal colleges that serve Native Amer-
1
ican Indian students have a valuable supplemental 
2
role to that provided by tribally controlled commu-
3
nity colleges in making available educational oppor-
4
tunities to Native American Indian students. 
5
(2) Some 4-year colleges serve Native American 
6
Indian students by providing tuition-free education, 
7
with the support of the State in which the institu-
8
tions are located, as mandated by Federal statute, to 
9
hundreds of Native American Indian students in ful-
10
fillment of a condition under which the United 
11
States provided land and facilities for colleges to a 
12
State or college. 
13
(3) The value of the Native American Indian 
14
student tuition waiver benefits contributed by these 
15
colleges and the States that support them today far 
16
exceeds the value of the original grant of land and 
17
facilities. 
18
(4) The ongoing financial burden of meeting 
19
this Federal mandate to provide tuition-free edu-
20
cation to Native American Indian students is no 
21
longer equitably shared among the States and col-
22
leges because it does not distinguish between Native 
23
American Indian students who are residents of the 
24
State or of another State.

•HR 1688 IH
(5) Native American Indian student tuition 
1
waiver benefits are now at risk of being terminated 
2
by severe budget constraints being experienced by 
3
these colleges and the States which support them. 
4
(b) PURPOSE.—It is the purpose of this Act to ensure 
5
that Federal funding is provided in order to relieve con-
6
strained State education budgets and to support and sus-
7
tain the longstanding Federal mandate requiring colleges 
8
and States to waive, in certain circumstances, tuition 
9
charges for Native American Indian students admitted to 
10
an undergraduate college program, including the waiver 
11
of tuition charges for Native American Indian students 
12
who are not residents of the State in which the college 
13
is located.
