To require health insurance coverage for the treatment of 
infertility. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

•HR 2803 IH
(1) Infertility is a medical disease recognized by 
1
the World Health Organization, the American Soci-
2
ety for Reproductive Medicine, and the American 
3
Medical Association that affects men and women 
4
equally. 
5
(2) According to the Centers for Disease Con-
6
trol and Prevention, 1 in 8 couples have difficulty 
7
getting pregnant or sustaining a pregnancy. 
8
(3) Infertility affects a broad spectrum of pro-
9
spective parents. No matter what race, religion, sex-
10
ual orientation, or economic status one is, infertility 
11
does not discriminate. 
12
(4) According to the Centers for Disease Con-
13
trol and Prevention, 11 percent of women in the 
14
United States between the ages of 15 and 44 have 
15
difficulty getting pregnant or staying pregnant. 
16
Similarly, 9 percent of men in the United States be-
17
tween the ages of 15 and 44 experience infertility. 
18
(5) Infertility disproportionately affects individ-
19
uals with particular health complications. For cancer 
20
patients and others who must undergo treatments 
21
such as chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hormone 
22
therapy, or surgery that are likely to harm the re-
23
productive system and organs, fertility preservation 
24
becomes necessary.

•HR 2803 IH
(6) Leading causes of infertility include chronic 
1
conditions and diseases of the endocrine or metabolic 
2
systems, such as primary ovarian insufficiency, poly-
3
cystic ovarian syndrome, endometriosis, thyroid dis-
4
orders, menstrual cycle defects, autoimmune dis-
5
orders, hormonal imbalances, testicular disorders, 
6
and urological health issues. Other causes include 
7
structural problems or blockages within the repro-
8
ductive system, exposure to infectious diseases, occu-
9
pational or environmental hazards, or genetic influ-
10
ences. 
11
(7) Recent improvements in therapy and 
12
cryopreservation make pregnancy possible for more 
13
people than in past years. 
14
(8) Like all other diseases, infertility and its 
15
treatments should be covered by health insurance. 
16
(9) A 2017 national survey of employer-spon-
17
sored health plans found that 44 percent of employ-
18
ers with at least 500 employees did not cover infer-
19
tility services, and 25 percent of companies with 
20
20,000 or more employees did not cover infertility 
21
services. 
22
(10) Coverage for infertility services under 
23
State Medicaid programs is limited. The Medicaid 
24
programs of only 5 States provide diagnostic testing 
25

for women and men in all of their program eligibility 
1
pathways; the Medicaid program of only one State 
2
provides coverage for certain medications for women 
3
experiencing infertility; and no State Medicaid pro-
4
grams cover intrauterine insemination or in vitro 
5
fertilization. 
6
(11) States that do not require private insur-
7
ance coverage of assisted reproductive technology 
8
have higher rates of multiple births. 
9
(12) The ability to have a family should not be 
10
denied to anyone on account of a lack of insurance 
11
coverage for medically necessary treatment.
