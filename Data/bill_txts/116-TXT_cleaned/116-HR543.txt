RESOLUTION 
Recognizing Hong Kong’s bilateral relationship with the 
United States, condemning the interference of the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China in Hong Kong’s affairs, and 
supporting the people of Hong Kong’s right to protest. 
Whereas the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 
(Public Law 102–383) states that— 
(1) ‘‘[s]upport for democratization is a fundamental 
principle of United States foreign policy’’; 
(2) ‘‘the human rights of the people of Hong Kong 
are of great importance to the United States and are di-
rectly relevant to United States interests in Hong Kong 
[and] serve as a basis for Hong Kong’s continued eco-
nomic prosperity’’; and

(3) Hong Kong must remain sufficiently autono-
mous from the People’s Republic of China to justify a 
different treatment than accorded to the People’s Repub-
lic of China under United States law; 
Whereas the United States maintains substantial economic 
and political interests in Hong Kong, with more than 
1,300 United States firms operating in the Special Ad-
ministrative Region, owing largely to Hong Kong’s favor-
able business environment; 
Whereas the United States supports Hong Kong’s ‘‘high de-
gree of autonomy’’ promised by the Sino-British Joint 
Declaration of 1984 in accordance with the ‘‘one country, 
two systems’’ framework by concluding and implementing 
bilateral agreements, promoting trade and investment, 
and bolstering educational, academic, and cultural links; 
Whereas the Department of State reported in its 2019 Hong 
Kong Policy Act Report, dated March 21, 2019, that the 
People’s Republic of China has implemented a number of 
fixed ‘‘redlines’’ inconsistent with China’s commitments 
in the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administra-
tive Region, and the Sino-British Joint Declaration of 
1984, which have diminished Hong Kong’s high degree of 
autonomy; 
Whereas the Communist Party of China has increasingly con-
strained Hong Kong’s freedoms in violation of the ‘‘one 
country, two systems’’ framework by supporting, among 
other actions, the banishment of the pro-independence 
Hong Kong National Party, the restriction of entry for 
individuals critical of the Communist Party of China, the 
refusal of a United States extradition request in May 
2018, and the indiscriminate disqualification of can-

didates for office due to their alleged support for Hong 
Kong self-determination; 
Whereas, on April 3, 2019, the Government of Hong Kong 
introduced a bill to amend the Fugitive Offenders and 
Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance 
laws (commonly known as the extradition bill) concerning 
extradition to expand the extradition arrangement to in-
clude mainland China, which would allow for the 
handover of any persons in the territory of Hong Kong, 
residents and nonresidents, as well as materials in their 
possession; 
Whereas the Department of State issued a statement on June 
9, 2019, warning that the lack of procedural protections 
in the bill could negatively impact Hong Kong’s long-
standing protections of human rights, fundamental free-
doms, and democratic values; 
Whereas, on June 9, 2019, approximately 1,000,000 people 
peacefully rallied against the bill, and on June 12, 2019, 
in Admiralty, tens of thousands staged a protest outside 
the city’s government headquarters to stop the legislators 
from moving forward with the bill; 
Whereas, on June 12, the Government of Hong Kong took 
advantage of the acts of a small minority of protesters 
and classified the largely peaceful protest as an unlawful 
assembly and a ‘‘riot’’, a charge that can result in a pris-
on sentence of up to 10 years for those who were ar-
rested; 
Whereas the police’s excessive use of force on June 12, 2019, 
to disperse the protestors, including tear gas, beanbag 
rounds, rubber bullets, batons, and pepper spray, widely 
visible in video footage, fueled tensions, contributed to

worsening violence, and caused severe injuries to pro-
testers; 
Whereas, on June 16, 2019, approximately 2,000,000 people 
peacefully gathered in Admiralty, equivalent to 25 per-
cent of the population, the largest protest in Hong 
Kong’s history; 
Whereas, on July 21, 2019, a self-professed progovernment 
mob of men violently attacked protestors, innocent by-
standers, and journalists with sticks and metal bars in 
Yuen Long, which resulted in the hospitalization of 45 
people, with 1 person in critical condition; 
Whereas the Royal Hong Kong Police have failed to take ac-
tion against the progovernment ‘‘triad’’ gangs, suggesting 
the police may be complicit in their actions; 
Whereas the protestors’ demands include: the complete with-
drawal of the bill to amend the extradition bill; the imple-
mentation of universal adult suffrage in the election of 
Chief Executive and the Legislative Council; the estab-
lishment of an independent commission to investigate 
whether police have used excessive force; the declassifica-
tion of the protest as a riot; and the dropping of all 
charges against persons who did not personally engage in 
violence; 
Whereas, on July 27, 2019, 9 people were injured when po-
lice fired rubber bullets at demonstrators in Yuen Long 
who were protesting the July 21, 2019, triad gangs’ vio-
lent attacks and the lack of a police response to them; 
Whereas, on July 29, 2019, China’s spokesman for the State 
Council’s Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office issued a 
statement referring to the protesters as ‘‘radical elements

police for sticking to their posts; 
Whereas, on July 30, 2019, China’s Foreign Ministry said 
the pro-democracy protests are the ‘‘work of the United 
States’’, alleging that there had been unprecedented lev-
els of contact between prodemocracy leaders and the 
United States; 
Whereas the Chinese Communist Party has expressed its 
‘‘strong indignation’’ and has called the protests ‘‘abso-
lutely intolerable’’, raising fears that the Party may use 
force in an attempt to violently suppress the protestors; 
Whereas, on August 5, 2019, teachers, aviation workers, fi-
nance employees, and civil servants went on strike across 
7 districts, the largest citywide strike in decades, which 
evolved into a wave of demonstrations, and resulted in 
the police firing 800 tear gas rounds to clear the 
protestors, almost as many as were used in the previous 
8 weeks; 
Whereas, on August 5, 2019, a self-professed pro-government 
mob of men violently attacked demonstrators with sticks 
and metal bars in North Point after the demonstrators 
were dispersed by police from Admiralty, and again the 
police did not respond to the ambush; 
Whereas, on August 6, 2019, a Chinese Communist Party of-
ficial threatened the demonstrators by stating that, 
‘‘those who play with fire will perish by it’’ and ‘‘as for 
their [the demonstrators,] punishment, it’s only a matter 
of time’’; and 
Whereas, on August 7, 2019, pro-Beijing media began pub-
