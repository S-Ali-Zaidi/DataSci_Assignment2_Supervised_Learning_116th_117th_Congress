A BILL 
To increase the annual funding for the Chronic Disease 
Prevention and Health Promotion Fund, the National 
Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities, and 
the Offices of Minority Health within the Office of the 
Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Agency 
for Healthcare Research and Quality, the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention, the Centers for Medi-
care & Medicaid Services, the Food and Drug Adminis-
tration, the Health Resources and Services Administra-
tion, and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Serv-

ices Administration to enable the United States and 
State departments of public health to better combat dis-
parities that have emerged during the COVID–19 crisis 
and beyond, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Reducing COVID–19 
4
Disparities by Investing in Public Health Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
The Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Funding under this Act is essential to core 
8
efforts at the Department of Health and Human 
9
Services and in local and State health departments 
10
to prevent and control the spread of chronic disease 
11
and conditions. The National Center for Chronic 
12
Disease Prevention and Health Promotion works to 
13
raise awareness of health disparities faced by minor-
14
ity populations of the United States such as Amer-
15
ican Indians, Alaska Natives, Asian Americans, Afri-
16
can Americans, Latino Americans, and Native Ha-
17
waiians or other Pacific Islanders. One of the pri-
18
mary functions of the Center is to reduce risk fac-
19
tors for groups affected by health disparities. 
20
(2) Six in ten Americans live with at least one 
21
chronic disease, like heart disease and stroke, can-
22

cer, or diabetes. These and other chronic diseases 
1
are the leading causes of death and disability in 
2
America. Specifically, chronic diseases are respon-
3
sible for 7 in 10 deaths each year. According to the 
4
Centers 
for 
Disease 
Control 
and 
Prevention 
5
(‘‘CDC’’), individuals who are at high risk for severe 
6
illness from COVID–19 are people with chronic lung 
7
disease or moderate to severe asthma, people with 
8
serious heart conditions, people who are immuno-
9
compromised—sometimes because of cancer or HIV/ 
10
AIDS, people with diabetes, people with liver dis-
11
ease, people with severe obesity, and people with 
12
chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis. 
13
(3) According to hospital data from the first 
14
month of the COVID–19 epidemic in the United 
15
States released by the CDC, roughly 1 in 3 people 
16
who required hospitalizations from COVID–19 were 
17
African American. While 33 percent of total hos-
18
pitalized patients are Black, African Americans con-
19
stitute just 13 percent of the entire American popu-
20
lation. Early data released by States and municipali-
21
ties show that African Americans suffer higher mor-
22
tality rates from COVID–19. Socioeconomic factors 
23
further contribute to racial disparities seen in both 
24
prevalence of chronic conditions and exposure to 
25

COVID–19. Individuals in low-income communities 
1
and people of color are more likely to have many of 
2
the chronic health conditions that have been identi-
3
fied as risk factors for complications from COVID– 
4
19, yet suffer decreased access to care, compounded 
5
by a decreased likelihood of undergoing appropriate 
6
treatment. 
7
(4) According to the American Diabetes Asso-
8
ciation, 12.1 percent of Hispanic Americans, 12.7 
9
percent of African Americans, 8 percent of Asian 
10
Americans, and 15.1 percent of American Indians/ 
11
Alaska Natives have been diagnosed with diabetes, 
12
compared to just 7.4 percent of White Americans. 
13
The CDC calculated that compared to non-Hispanic 
14
Whites, Hispanics are 40 percent more likely to die 
15
from diabetes, African Americans are twice as likely 
16
to die from diabetes, and American Indians/Alaska 
17
Natives are almost twice as likely to die from the 
18
disease. 
19
(5) According to the National Institutes of 
20
Health, African Americans are more than 30 percent 
21
more likely to die from heart disease, are twice as 
22
likely to have a stroke—which tends to be more se-
23
vere with a higher morbidity and results in higher 
24
mortality, are 40 percent more likely to have high

blood pressure, and have a higher rate of hyper-
1
tension and heart failure than their White counter-
2
parts. 
3
(6) Minority groups suffer from asthma at a 
4
disproportionate rate, have the highest number of 
5
emergency room visits and hospital stays due to 
6
asthma, and have higher mortality rates from asth-
7
ma than their White counterparts. The prevalence of 
8
childhood asthma for African Americans is 12.7 per-
9
cent compared to 8 percent for White Americans, 
10
while mortality rates in children and adults are 
11
eightfold and threefold higher, respectively, for Afri-
12
can Americans compared to White Americans. 
13
(7) President Trump has consistently proposed 
14
budgets that would cut the Chronic Disease Preven-
15
tion and Health Promotion Fund. In fiscal year 
16
2021, the President proposed to consolidate the 
17
CDC’s primary chronic disease prevention activities, 
18
including tobacco, diabetes, heart disease, and 
19
stroke, and nutrition and physical activity, into a 
20
single block grant to States, while proposing a 
21
$427,000,000 cut to the account. In fiscal year 
22
2020, the President proposed a $236,500,000 cut to 
23
the account. In fiscal year 2019, the President pro-
24
posed a $138,300,000 cut to the account. In fiscal 
25

•HR 6638 IH
year 2018, the President proposed a $222,300,000 
1
cut to the account. 
2
(8) Cuts to this Fund and other public health 
3
prevention efforts undermine efforts to create an af-
4
fordable and accessible health care system, and a 
5
better quality of life for Americans of all ethnic, ra-
6
cial, and socioeconomic backgrounds. Cuts to this 
7
Fund would also exacerbate existing disparities and 
8
underlying health conditions that have created seem-
9
ingly vast disparities in hospitalization and mortality 
10
rates due to COVID–19. 
11
(9) Prevention efforts have proven to be effec-
12
tive. Funding increases for community-based public 
13
health programs reduce preventable disease caused 
14
by diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. Im-
15
proved access to intervention, treatment, and afford-
16
able care is also proven to mitigate the development 
17
of associated chronic diseases and mortality rates.

(11) Further, the Office of Minority Health in

the Office of the Secretary of Health and Human 
4
Services (established by section 1707 of the Public 
5
Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300u–6)) was de-
6
signed for the purpose of ‘‘improving minority health 
7
and the quality of health care minorities receive, and 
8
eliminating racial and ethnic disparities’’. The Office 
9
of Minority Health and Health Equity at the CDC 
10
serves to decrease health disparities, address social 
11
determinants of health, and promote access to high- 
12
quality preventative health care. The Office of Mi-
13
nority Health and Health Equity at the Food and 
14
Drug Administration promotes and protects the 
15
health of diverse populations through research and 
16
communication of science that addresses health dis-
17
parities. The National Institute on Minority Health 
18
and Health Disparities leads scientific research that 
19
advances understanding of minority health and 
20
health disparities. 
21
(12) Increasing funding for these and other 
22
critical health programs will enable the United 
23
States and State departments of public health to
