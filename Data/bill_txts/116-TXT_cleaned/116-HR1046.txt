Whereas the ratification of the 19th Amendment marks the 
single largest expansion of voting rights in United States 
history; 
Whereas the ratification of the 19th Amendment did not, in 
practice, guarantee voting rights to all American women, 
as African-American women, Native American women, 
Asian American women, Hispanic American women, and 
other women of color in America continued to face legal 
and social barriers to voting throughout the twentieth 
century; 
Whereas the suffragists persevered in their quest for women’s 
equality through generations of hardships, including the 
Civil War, Reconstruction, World War I, and the Spanish 
Flu pandemic; and 
Whereas the Women’s Suffrage Centennial Commission was 
created to encourage, plan, develop, and execute pro-
grams, projects, and activities to commemorate the cen-
tennial of the passage and ratification of the 19th 
Amendment: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the designation of National Wom-
2
en’s Suffrage Month; 
3
(2) celebrates the 100th anniversary of the pas-
