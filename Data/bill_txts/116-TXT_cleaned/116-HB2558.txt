1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. FINDINGS. 
3
Congress finds the following: 
4
(1) The United States dollar has lost 30 per-
5
cent of its purchasing power since 2000, and 96 per-
6
cent of its purchasing power since the end of the 
7
gold standard in 1913. 
8
(2) Under the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent in-
9
flation objective, the dollar loses half of its pur-
10
chasing power every generation, or 35 years.

(3) American families need long-term price sta-
1
bility to meet their household spending needs, save 
2
money, and plan for retirement. 
3
(4) The Federal Reserve policy of long-term in-
4
flation has made American manufacturing uncom-
5
petitive, raising the cost of United States manufac-
6
tured goods by more than 40 percent since 2000, 
7
compared to less than 20 percent in Germany and 
8
France. 
9
(5) Between 2000 and 2010, United States 
10
manufacturing employment shrunk by one-third 
11
after holding steady for 30 years at nearly 
12
20,000,000 jobs. 
13
(6) The American economy needs a stable dol-
14
lar, fixed exchange rates, and money supply con-
15
trolled by the market not the government. 
16
(7) The gold standard puts control of the 
17
money supply with the market instead of the Fed-
18
eral Reserve. 
19
(8) The gold standard means legal tender de-
20
fined by and convertible into a certain quantity of 
21
gold. 
22
(9) Under the gold standard through 1913 the 
23
United States economy grew at an annual average of

four percent, one-third larger than the growth rate 
1
since then and twice the level since 2000. 
2
(10) The international gold exchange standard 
3
from 1914 to 1971 did not provide for a United 
4
States dollar convertible into gold, and therefore 
5
helped cause the Great Depression and stagflation. 
6
(11) The Federal Reserve’s trickle down policy 
7
of expanding the money supply with no demand for 
8
it has enriched the owners of financial assets but en-
9
dangered the jobs, wages, and savings of blue collar 
10
workers. 
11
(12) Restoring American middle-class pros-
12
perity requires change in monetary policy authorized 
13
to Congress in Article I, Section 8, Clause 5 of the 
14
Constitution. 
15
