Congress finds the following:

•HR 3580 IH
(1) Reporting abortion data has been voluntary 
1
in the past, which has not resulted in complete data 
2
being submitted to the Centers for Disease Control 
3
and Prevention. 
4
(2) While the Centers for Disease Control and 
5
Prevention requests specific data points from each 
6
State and the District of Columbia, there is a great 
7
variety in the information collected and published by 
8
the States. 
9
(3) In fact, there is not a single abortion data 
10
point publicly reported for all fifty States and the 
11
District of Columbia. 
12
(4) Even more alarming, three States that to-
13
gether account for 15 percent of the United States 
14
population of women of childbearing age do not re-
15
port any abortion data to the Centers for Disease 
16
Control and Prevention. 
17
(5) Accurate statistical data regarding abortion 
18
and those who survive abortion attempts is critical 
19
to public health and policy analysis.
