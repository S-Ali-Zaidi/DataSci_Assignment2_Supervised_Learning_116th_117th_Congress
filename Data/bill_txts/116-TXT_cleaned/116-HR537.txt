RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives regard-
ing United States policy recognizing the Assyrian Geno-
cide. 
Whereas the Ottoman Empire committed the crime of geno-
cide against the Assyrian people, killing at least 300,000 
innocent Assyrians during the time of the First World 
War; 
Whereas Raphael Lemkin, who coined the term ‘‘genocide’’ in 
1944, drew on the history of the Assyrian Genocide in his 
seminal work that guided the United Nations Convention 
on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide; 
Whereas the Elie Wiesel Genocide and Atrocities Prevention 
Act of 2018 (Public Law 115–441) establishes that

States to pursue a United States Government-wide strat-
egy to identify, prevent, and respond to the risk of atroc-
ities by ‘‘strengthening diplomatic response and the effec-
tive use of foreign assistance to support appropriate tran-
sitional justice measures, including criminal account-
ability, for past atrocities’’; 
Whereas the resilience and endurance of the Assyrian people 
is still commendable and praiseworthy, despite being vic-
tims of an ethnocide that is being continued by the Is-
lamic State; 
Whereas American families continue to feel the effects of the 
Assyrian Genocide, including families that have never 
been reunited since; 
Whereas recognition and commemoration of a genocide is 
critical to efforts to prevent both future genocides and 
further harm to the group upon which the genocide was 
committed; and 
Whereas the Assyrian Genocide remains unrecognized by 
many countries and organizations across the globe, in-
cluding the United States: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-
