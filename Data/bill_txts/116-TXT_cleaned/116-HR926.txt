•HRES 926 IH 
April 17, 2020, as ‘‘Black Maternal Health Week’’ to 
bring national attention to the United States maternal 
health crisis in the Black community and the importance 
of reducing maternal mortality and morbidity among 
Black women and birthing persons. 
Whereas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, Black women in the United States are three 
to four times more likely than White women to die from 
pregnancy-related causes; 
Whereas Black women in the United States suffer from life- 
threatening pregnancy complications, known as ‘‘mater-
nal morbidities’’, twice as often as White women; 
Whereas maternal mortality rates in the United States are— 
(1) among the highest in the developed world; and 
(2) increasing rapidly; 
Whereas the United States has the highest maternal mor-
tality rate among affluent countries, in part because of 
the disproportionate mortality rate of Black women; 
Whereas Black women are 49 percent more likely than all 
other women to deliver prematurely; 
Whereas the high rates of maternal mortality among Black 
women span across— 
(1) income levels; 
(2) education levels; and 
(3) socioeconomic status; 
Whereas structural racism, gender oppression, and the social 
determinants of health inequities experienced by Black 
women in the United States significantly contribute to 
the disproportionately high rates of maternal mortality 
and morbidity among Black women;

Whereas racism and discrimination play a consequential role 
in maternal health care, experiences, and outcomes; 
Whereas a fair distribution of resources, especially with re-
gard to reproductive health care services and maternal 
health programming, is critical to closing the maternal 
health racial disparity gap; 
Whereas the COVID–19 pandemic is disparately affecting the 
Black community and has further amplified existing 
health care inequities in the United States, exacerbating 
the Black maternal health crisis; 
Whereas, even as there is growing concern about improving 
access to mental health services, Black women are least 
likely to have access to mental health screenings, treat-
ment, and support before, during, and after pregnancy; 
Whereas justice-informed, culturally congruent models of care 
are beneficial to Black women; and 
Whereas an investment must be made in— 
(1) maternity care for Black women and birthing 
persons, including support of care led by the communities 
most impacted by the United States maternal health cri-
sis; and 
(2) policies that support and promote affordable, 
comprehensive, and holistic maternal health care that is 
free from gender and racial discrimination: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives recog-
1
nizes— 
2
(1) that Black women are experiencing high, 
3
disproportionate rates of maternal mortality and 
4
morbidity in the United States;
