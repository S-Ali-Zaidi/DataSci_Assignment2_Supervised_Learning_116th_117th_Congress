•HR 2250 IH
(1) Coast redwoods are an iconic California re-
1
source that represents the beauty and natural gran-
2
deur of the Golden State. 
3
(2) These ancient redwood forests contain the 
4
tallest trees on Earth, which grow to be more than 
5
3,500 years old. 
6
(3) Redwood forests serve as the most effective 
7
forest-based carbon sink in the world, storing 3 
8
times or more carbon per acre than any other forest 
9
ecosystem. 
10
(4) Healthy old-growth redwood forests provide 
11
important ecological benefits, including clean air, 
12
habitat for special status plants and animals, and 
13
water resources that are critical to the health and 
14
sustainability of federally listed salmon fisheries. 
15
(5) Redwood forests are true wonders of the 
16
world, inspiring more than 31 million visitors every 
17
year in California’s redwood parks and supporting a 
18
multi-billion dollar outdoor recreation economy. 
19
(6) The redwood forests of northern California 
20
are the ancestral home of several tribal nations, 
21
whose members use stewardship and natural re-
22
source management expertise to protect and restore 
23
these forestlands.

(7) After the 1849 Gold Rush, demand for lum-
1
ber devastated ancient redwood forests and today 
2
only 5 percent of the original old-growth coast red-
3
woods remain. 
4
(8) Redwood National and State Parks safe-
5
guard more than one-third of the world’s remaining 
6
old-growth coast redwood forests. 
7
(9) These parks contain tens of thousands of 
8
acres of redwood forests that have been logged, and 
9
require innovative application of science and tech-
10
nology to improve forest stewardship and accelerate 
11
forest regeneration. 
12
(10) Restoration of these forest ecosystems will 
13
hasten the return of healthy old-growth forests, 
14
while providing jobs in local communities and en-
15
hancing native habitat for numerous plant and ani-
16
mal species. 
17
(11) Redwood National and State Parks are 
18
partnering with nongovernmental organizations and 
19
tribes to restore these redwood forest ecosystems.

(12) Redwood forest restoration benefits the 
21
people of California for generations to come.
