SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
The Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) By law, the Postal Service operates as ‘‘a 
3
basic and fundamental service provided to the people 
4
by the Government of the United States’’ and must 
5
serve rural, suburban, and urban areas throughout 
6
the United States. 
7
(2) The Postal Service is a lifeline for busi-
8
nesses and consumers across the United States, es-
9
pecially those in remote and rural areas of the coun-
10
try, delivering business correspondence, educational, 
11
cultural and scientific information, critical prescrip-
12
tions and medications, household items, and com-
13
mercial goods with affordable, reliable service not 
14
fewer than 6 days per week. 
15
(3) The Postal Service helps small businesses 
16
stay connected with their customers no matter where 
17
they are located or where their customers live. 
18
(4) Since 1970, the Postal Service has been 
19
charged with operating as a self-sustaining entity 
20
and its operations are funded from postage paid for 
21
mail and shipping and not primarily by taxpayer 
22
funds. 
23
(5) The Government Accountability Office re-
24
ports that the Postal Service has lost approximately 
25
$78,000,000,000 from fiscal year 2007 through 
26

2019 due primarily to declining mail volumes and 
1
rising costs. 
2
(6) Package delivery volumes have more than 
3
doubled since 2010, but the Postal Service faces 
4
competition in this area. 
5
(7) The Postal Service is not on a sustainable 
6
path and needs reform to be viable over the long 
7
term. 
8
(8) Reforms must be focused on the long-term 
9
solvency of the Postal Service while ensuring the 
10
greatest benefit to the public and 630,000 employees 
11
of the Postal Service. 
12
(9) By law, the authority for operation and 
13
strategic direction of the Postal Service, an inde-
14
pendent establishment of the executive branch, is 
15
delegated to the Board of Governors of the Postal 
16
Service, including the Postmaster General. 
17
(10) On May 6, 2020, the Board of Governors 
18
of the Postal Service selected Louis DeJoy as the 
19
75th Postmaster General of the United States. 
20
(11) The new Postmaster General should be 
21
given the opportunity to review the operations and 
22
finances of the Postal Service and, in coordination 
23
with the rest of the Board of Governors of the Post-

al Service, propose a plan to ensure its long-term vi-
1
ability. 
2
(12) At the same time, the COVID–19 pan-
3
demic has significantly contributed to the decline in 
4
market dominant mail volumes and revenues while 
5
increasing costs, putting additional stress on the fi-
6
nancial situation of the Postal Service. 
7
(13) Now more than ever, affordable mail and 
8
package delivery provided by the Postal Service is a 
9
lifeline for people in the United States, especially for 
10
seniors and others living in remote and rural areas. 
11
(14) The critical services the Postal Service 
12
provides will play a fundamental part of the eco-
13
nomic recovery of the United States. 
14
(15) Congress should provide immediate emer-
15
gency appropriations to cover financial losses to the 
16
Postal Service caused by the COVID–19 pandemic 
17
in order to keep the Postal Service operating without 
18
interruptions in service and to give the new Post-
19
master General and the Board of Governors of the 
20
Postal Service time to formulate and propose to 
21
Congress a plan to ensure the long-term viability of 
22
the Postal Service.
