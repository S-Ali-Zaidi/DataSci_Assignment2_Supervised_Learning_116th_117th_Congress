SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Parren Mitchell Minor-
2
ity Business Education and Empowerment Act of 2019’’. 
3
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
The Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) As many colleges and universities across the 
6
country kept their doors closed to African-American 
7
applicants, historically Black colleges and univer-
8
sities (referred to in this section as ‘‘HBCUs’’) 
9
played a central role in ensuring that African Ameri-
10
cans could attain an excellent education. 
11
(2) In 1970, Congressman Parren Mitchell be-
12
came the first African American from Maryland to 
13
be elected to the House of Representatives. During 
14
his time in Congress, Congressman Mitchell served 
15
as the Chairman of the Small Business Committee, 
16
was a founding member of the Congressional Black 
17
Caucus, and served as a senior member of the then- 
18
House Banking, Finance, and Urban Affairs Com-
19
mittee. In these roles, Congressman Mitchell vigor-
20
ously supported economic empowerment for minority 
21
businesses and education as a vehicle for social mo-
22
bility. 
23
(3) The Bureau of the Census in 2017 indi-
24
cated that African Americans have a median house-
25
03:30 Jun 07, 2019
H2981
3 
•HR 2981 IH
hold income that is 63 percent of the median house-
1
hold income of Whites. 
2
(4) In the first quarter of 2019, the African- 
3
American unemployment rate was 7.1 percent, well 
4
above the national average of 4.1 percent. 
5
(5) According to the Minority Business Devel-
6
opment Agency— 
7
(A) minority firms are more likely to be 
8
denied loans at a rate of nearly three times 
9
higher than nonminority firms; 
10
(B) minority firms are likely to pay higher 
11
interest rates, on average 7.8 percent, while 
12
nonminority firms pay on average 6.4 percent; 
13
(C) minority firms are less likely to receive 
14
loans and, when approved, receive lower loan 
15
amounts; 
16
(D) minority firms secure a lower number 
17
and dollar amount of contracts in proportion to 
18
the number of available minority firms in the 
19
relevant market; and 
20
(E) minority business enterprises represent 
21
29 percent of all firms but only 11 percent have 
22
paid employees. 
23

•HR 2981 IH
(6) If minority business enterprises were to ob-
1
tain entrepreneurial parity, the United States econ-
2
omy would realize 13 million more jobs. 
3
(7) Minority-owned businesses are nearly twice 
4
as likely to export their products and services as 
5
nonminority owned businesses. Minority-owned busi-
6
nesses are three times more likely to generate 100 
7
percent of their revenues from exporting than non-
8
minority owned firms. 
9
(8) Minority-owned businesses expand and di-
10
versify the tax base, creating sustainable commu-
11
nities with a steady rate of economic growth. 
12
(9) A 2019 GAO report found that only 18 out 
13
of 101 HBCUs are in the Small Business Develop-
14
ment Center (SBDC) network, and only 2 serve as 
15
‘‘lead’’ (host organization) SBDCs. 
16
(10) Currently, to be a SBDC host organiza-
17
tion, an HBCU must provide matching funds, which 
18
has led to only 2 such sites in the history of the pro-
19
gram. 
20
(11) The 2019 GAO report stated that, while 
21
the Small Business Administration (SBA) is re-
22
quired by Executive order to submit an agency plan 
23
on an annual basis to the White House Initiative on 
24
HBCUs, GAO was only able to obtain the 2018 
25

•HR 2981 IH
agency plan from the 2008–2018 time period and 
1
was unable to determine if the SBA had met its 
2
goals related to supporting HBCUs. 
3
(12) The 2018 SBA agency plan stated that 
4
the SBA would encourage the formation of strategic 
5
alliance memorandums between SBA district offices 
6
and HBCUs to promote entrepreneurship in under-
7
served markets. 
8
(13) The 2019 GAO report found that, accord-
9
ing to SBA officials, strategic alliance memoran-
10
dums with HBCUs are largely symbolic in nature.
