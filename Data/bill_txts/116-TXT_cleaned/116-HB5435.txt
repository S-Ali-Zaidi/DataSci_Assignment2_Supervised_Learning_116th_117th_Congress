SEC. 2. PUBLIC LANDS ENERGY AND CLIMATE POLICY. 
3
It is the policy of the United States that— 
4
(1) the United States should aggressively re-
5
duce greenhouse gas emissions from United States 
6
public lands and oceans and strive to achieve net- 
7
zero emissions as soon as possible; 
8
(2) public lands should be managed to reduce 
9
greenhouse gas emissions and co-pollutant emissions 
10
and to respond to unavoidable impacts of climate 
11
change through increased resilience of ecosystems 
12
and wildlife habitats in accordance with the prin-
13
ciples of multiple use and sustained yield; 
14
(3) the protection of ocean ecosystems is vital 
15
to promoting ocean health and increasing resilience 
16
to climate change, and conservation of United States 
17
marine resources is one of the best ways to remove 
18
carbon dioxide from the atmosphere; 
19
(4) energy development decisions on public 
20
lands and oceans should be guided by the goals of— 
21
20:46 Dec 27, 2019
H5435
3 
•HR 5435 IH
(A) protecting human well-being, biodiver-
1
sity, and the environment; 
2
(B) avoiding the most harmful impacts of 
3
climate change; and 
4
(C) promoting a rapid, sustainable, just, 
5
and equitable transition to a clean energy econ-
6
omy; and 
7
(5) environmental justice communities are more 
8
vulnerable to the effects of emissions from public 
9
lands and oceans and often have the least resources 
10
to respond; thus, they should be meaningfully en-
11
gaged in government decision making as our Nation 
12
reduces emissions from public lands and oceans and 
13
builds its climate resilience against the effects of 
14
those emissions.
