A BILL 
To improve technology and address human factors in aviation 
safety, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Safe Landings Act’’. 
4
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
5
Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) Given that the United States enjoys an ex-
7
ceptionally safe aviation system with an exceedingly 
8
low frequency of airline accidents, efforts to improve 
9

•HR 4166 IH
aviation safety should examine nonaccident safety 
1
incidents for all possible insights. 
2
(2) Aviation safety should not be taken for 
3
granted, and even with so few accidents, the U.S. 
4
Aerospace System should proactively address safety 
5
concerns that emerge from our dynamic and evolving 
6
economic conditions, technology, aviation industry, 
7
and other factors. 
8
(3) Preventing accidents from occurring in the 
9
airport runway environment remains an objective re-
10
quiring continued effort, and incidents of runway 
11
confusion, defined as the subset of runway incur-
12
sions in which an aircraft unintentionally takes off 
13
or lands on a taxiway or incorrect runway, should be 
14
carefully monitored, reviewed, and studied for in-
15
sights to improve safety. 
16
(4) While technology continues to advance and 
17
new opportunities to use technology to address safe-
18
ty risks in aviation are examined and pursued, the 
19
evolving role of technology and the expanding use of 
20
automation should not be used as justification to di-
21
minish attention to and prioritization of the human 
22
contribution to aviation safety. The aviation industry 
23
and the Government must ensure that training pro-
24
grams for flight crews and other personnel are ap-
25
03:38 Aug 16, 2019

•HR 4166 IH
propriately evolving, that training standards and ex-
1
pectations remain rigorous, and that risks and con-
2
cerns associated with the interaction between hu-
3
mans, technology, and automated systems are identi-
4
fied, studied, and addressed in a timely manner.
