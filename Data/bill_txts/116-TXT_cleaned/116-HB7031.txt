(1) an infectious disease pandemic known as 
1
COVID–19 exists; 
2
(2) to date, there is much still unknown about 
3
COVID–19, but it is known that COVID–19 and re-
4
lated complications may be fatal; 
5
(3) services provided by public safety officers 
6
are nonetheless essential during this pandemic; 
7
(4) due to the COVID–19 pandemic and what 
8
is currently known about how the disease is spread, 
9
public safety officers are uncharacteristically at risk 
10
of contracting the disease; and 
11
(5) although the Public Safety Officers’ Bene-
12
fits program currently covers deaths and permanent 
13
and total disabilities resulting from infectious dis-
14
ease sustained by public safety officers in carrying 
15
out their duties, the determination of claims involv-
16
ing personal injuries believed to have resulted from 
17
COVID–19 or its complications may be uniquely 
18
challenging or delayed given the lack of— 
19
(A) definitive testing and medical records 
20
at this time; and 
21
(B) a definitive uniform body of medical 
22
information about how the disease is spread or 
23
its effects.

be processed expeditiously and under fair and clear stand-

ards.
