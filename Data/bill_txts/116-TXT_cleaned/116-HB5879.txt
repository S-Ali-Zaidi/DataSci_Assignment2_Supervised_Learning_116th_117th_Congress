A BILL 
To impose certain limits relating to the national emergency 
authorities of the President, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Congressional Over-
4
sight of Sanctions Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Article I, section 8 of the United States 
8
Constitution gives Congress the power ‘‘to regulate 
9

•HR 5879 IH
Commerce with foreign Nations’’ as well as to ‘‘de-
1
fine and punish Piracies and Felonies committed on 
2
the high Seas, and Offenses against the Law of Na-
3
tions’’. 
4
(2) The House Committee on International Re-
5
lations report (No. 95–459) on the International 
6
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 
7
et seq.) states ‘‘that given the breadth of the au-
8
thorities and their availability at the President’s dis-
9
cretion upon a declaration of national emergency, 
10
their exercise should be subject to various sub-
11
stantive restrictions. The main one stems from a 
12
recognition that emergencies are by their nature 
13
rare and brief, and are not to be equated with nor-
14
mal, ongoing problems’’. 
15
(3) It further states, ‘‘A national emergency 
16
should be declared and emergency authorities em-
17
ployed only with respect to a specific set of cir-
18
cumstances which constitute a real emergency, and 
19
for no other purpose’’ and that ‘‘[t]he emergency 
20
should be terminated in a timely manner when the 
21
factual state of emergency is over and not continued 
22
in effect for use in other circumstances. A state of 
23
emergency should not be a normal state of affairs’’.

•HR 5879 IH
(4) Since 1977, Presidents have invoked au-
1
thorities under the International Emergency Eco-
2
nomic Powers Act with respect to 56 declarations of 
3
national emergency. On average, these emergencies 
4
last nearly a decade. 
5
(5) As of August 2019, there are 31 ongoing 
6
national emergencies involving the International 
7
Emergency Economic Powers Act, the oldest of 
8
which was put in place forty years ago. 
9
(6) The average length of an emergency de-
10
clared in the 1980s and invoking International 
11
Emergency Economic Powers Act authorities was 
12
four years. That average extended to 10 years for 
13
emergencies declared in the 1990s and 12 years for 
14
emergencies declared in the 2000s. 
15
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
16
It is the sense of Congress that— 
17
(1) successive Presidents from both parties have 
18
used the authority granted by the International 
19
Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 
20
et seq.) and the National Emergencies Act (50 
21
U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) to declare national emergencies 
22
that do not meet the threshold of ‘‘unusual and ex-
23
traordinary threat[s] to the national security and 
24
foreign policy of the United States’’; and 
25

(2) in order to restore Congress’ original intent 
1
in enacting such laws, it is necessary to reclaim Con-
2
gress’ constitutional power over the use of sanctions.
