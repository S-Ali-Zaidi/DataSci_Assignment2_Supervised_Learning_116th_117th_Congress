RESOLUTION 
Expressing the opposition of the House of Representatives 
to a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Re-
public of Ireland. 
Whereas, in 1998, the Government of Ireland, the Govern-
ment of the United Kingdom, and the political party 
leaders of Northern Ireland agreed upon the Good Friday 
Agreement to end years of violence; 
Whereas the people of Northern Ireland and the Republic of 
Ireland voted overwhelmingly in favor of the Good Friday 
Agreement in a referendum on May 22, 1998; 
Whereas the completion of the Good Friday Agreement 
marked a historic success and has been the basis for a 
peaceful resolution of a longstanding conflict;

•HRES 88 IH 
Whereas the United States is one of the three guarantors of 
the Good Friday Agreement; 
Whereas the United States has consistently reaffirmed its 
commitment to assist in building a strong society, econ-
omy, and enduring peace in Northern Ireland; 
Whereas the United States has continuously supported the 
International Fund for Ireland and appointed successive 
Peace Envoys to Northern Ireland; 
Whereas continued United States engagement in the North-
ern Ireland peace process is essential to protect the Good 
Friday Agreement; 
Whereas a 2016 referendum in Britain to leave the European 
Union has increased concerns about the future of the 
Good Friday Agreement and sustained peace in Northern 
Ireland; and 
Whereas the free flow of persons across open borders between 
the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom has 
been a fundamental aspect of promoting peace and unity 
throughout the implementation of the Good Friday 
Agreement: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives opposes 
1
the imposition of a hard border, whether one that is 
2
strongly controlled by officials, police, or soldiers, or a 
3
physical barrier, between Northern Ireland and the Re-
4
public of Ireland.
