TITLE 
VII—COVID–19 
COMPAS-
1
SION AND MARTHA WRIGHT 
2
PRISON PHONE JUSTICE 
3
SEC. 130701. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) Prison, jails, and other confinement facili-
6
ties in the United States have unique telecommuni-
7
cations needs due to safety and security concerns. 
8
(2) Unjust and unreasonable charges for tele-
9
phone and advanced communications services in con-
10
finement facilities negatively impact the safety and 
11
security of communities in the United States by 
12
damaging relationships between incarcerated persons 
13
and their support systems, thereby exacerbating re-
14
cidivism. 
15
(3) The COVID–19 pandemic has greatly inten-
16
sified these concerns. Jails and prisons have become 
17
epicenters for the spread of the virus, with incarcer-
18
ated persons concentrated in small, confined spaces 
19
and often without access to adequate health care. At 
20
Cook County jail alone, hundreds of incarcerated 
21
persons and jail staff have tested positive for the 
22
virus since its outbreak. 
23
(4) To prevent the spread of the virus, many 
24
jails and prisons across the country suspended pub-

lic visitation, leaving confinement facility commu-
1
nications services as the only way that incarcerated 
2
persons can stay in touch with their families. 
3
(5) All people in the United States, including 
4
anyone who pays for confinement facility commu-
5
nications services, should have access to communica-
6
tions services at charges that are just and reason-
7
able. 
8
(6) Unemployment has risen sharply as a result 
9
of the COVID–19 pandemic, straining the incomes 
10
of millions of Americans and making it even more 
11
difficult for families of incarcerated persons to pay 
12
the high costs of confinement facility communica-
13
tions services. 
14
(7) Certain markets for confinement facility 
15
communications services are distorted due to reverse 
16
competition, in which the financial interests of the 
17
entity making the buying decision (the confinement 
18
facility) are aligned with the seller (the provider of 
19
confinement facility communications services) and 
20
not the consumer (the incarcerated person or a 
21
member of his or her family). This reverse competi-
22
tion occurs because site commission payments to the 
23
confinement facility from the provider of confine-
24
ment facility communications services are the chief

1215 
•HR 6800 IH
criterion many facilities use to select their provider 
1
of confinement facility communications services. 
2
(8) Charges for confinement facility commu-
3
nications services that have been shown to be unjust 
4
and unreasonable are often a result of site commis-
5
sion payments that far exceed the costs incurred by 
6
the confinement facility in accommodating these 
7
services. 
8
(9) Unjust and unreasonable charges have been 
9
assessed for both audio and video services and for 
10
both intrastate and interstate communications from 
11
confinement facilities. 
12
(10) Though Congress enacted emergency legis-
13
lation to allow free communications in Federal pris-
14
ons during the pandemic, it does not cover commu-
15
nications to or from anyone incarcerated in State 
16
and local prisons or jails. 
17
(11) Mrs. Martha Wright-Reed led a campaign 
18
for just communications rates for incarcerated peo-
19
ple for over a decade. 
20
(12) Mrs. Wright-Reed was the lead plaintiff in 
21
Wright v. Corrections Corporation of America, CA 
22
No. 00–293 (GK) (D.D.C. 2001).

(13) That case ultimately led to the Wright Pe-
1
tition at the Federal Communications Commission, 
2
CC Docket No. 96–128 (November 3, 2003). 
3
(14) As a grandmother, Mrs. Wright-Reed was 
4
forced to choose between purchasing medication and 
5
communicating with her incarcerated grandson. 
6
(15) Mrs. Wright-Reed passed away on Janu-
7
ary 18, 2015, before fully realizing her dream of just 
8
communications rates for all people.

14
SEC. 191002. FINDINGS. 
15
Congress finds the following: 
16
(1) The incidence of violence known as hate 
17
crimes or crimes motivated by bias poses a serious 
18
national problem. 
19
(2) According to data obtained by the Federal 
20
Bureau of Investigation, the incidence of such vio-
21
lence increased in 2017, the most recent year for 
22
which data is available. 
23
(3) In 1990, Congress enacted the Hate Crime 
24
Statistics Act (Public Law 101–275; 28 U.S.C. 534

note) to provide the Federal Government, law en-
1
forcement agencies, and the public with data regard-
2
ing the incidence of hate crime. The Hate Crimes 
3
Statistics Act and the Matthew Shepard and James 
4
Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act (division E of 
5
Public Law 111–84; 123 Stat. 2835) have enabled 
6
Federal authorities to understand and, where appro-
7
priate, investigate and prosecute hate crimes. 
8
(4) A more complete understanding of the na-
9
tional problem posed by hate crime is in the public 
10
interest and supports the Federal interest in eradi-
11
cating bias-motivated violence referenced in section 
12
249(b)(1)(C) of title 18, United States Code. 
13
(5) However, a complete understanding of the 
14
national problem posed by hate crimes is hindered 
15
by incomplete data from Federal, State, and local 
16
jurisdictions through the Uniform Crime Reports 
17
program authorized under section 534 of title 28, 
18
United States Code, and administered by the Fed-
19
eral Bureau of Investigation. 
20
(6) Multiple factors contribute to the provision 
21
of inaccurate and incomplete data regarding the in-
22
cidence of hate crime through the Uniform Crime 
23
Reports program. A significant contributing factor is 
24
the quality and quantity of training that State and

local law enforcement agencies receive on the identi-
1
fication and reporting of suspected bias-motivated 
2
crimes. 
3
(7) The problem of crimes motivated by bias is 
4
sufficiently serious, widespread, and interstate in na-
5
ture as to warrant Federal financial assistance to 
6
States and local jurisdictions. 
7
(8) Federal financial assistance with regard to 
8
certain violent crimes motivated by bias enables Fed-
9
eral, State, and local authorities to work together as 
10
partners in the investigation and prosecution of such 
11
crimes.

This title may be cited as the ‘‘Pandemic Justice Re-

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) As of the date of introduction of this Act, 
7
the novel coronavirus has spread to all 50 States, 
8
the District of Columbia, and 3 territories. 
9
(2) The Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
10
vention have projected that between 160,000,000 
11
and 214,000,000 people could be infected by the 
12
novel coronavirus in the United States over the 
13
course of the pandemic. 
14
(3) Although the United States has less than 5 
15
percent of the world’s population, the United States 
16
holds approximately 21 percent of the world’s pris-
17
oners and leads the world in the number of individ-
18
uals incarcerated, with nearly 2,200,000 people in-
19
carcerated in State and Federal prisons and local 
20
jails. 
21
(4) Studies have shown that individuals age out 
22
of crime starting around 25 years of age, and re-
23
leased individuals over the age of 50 have a very low 
24
recidivism rate.

•HR 6800 IH
(5) According to public health experts, incarcer-
1
ated individuals are particularly vulnerable to being 
2
gravely impacted by the novel corona virus pandemic 
3
because— 
4
(A) they have higher rates of underlying 
5
health issues than members of the general pub-
6
lic, including higher rates of respiratory disease, 
7
heart disease, diabetes, obesity, HIV/AIDS, 
8
substance abuse, hepatitis, and other conditions 
9
that suppress immune response; and 
10
(B) the close conditions and lack of access 
11
to hygiene products in prisons make these insti-
12
tutions 
unusually 
susceptible 
to 
viral 
13
pandemics. 
14
(6) The spread of communicable disease in the 
15
United States generally constitutes a serious, height-
16
ened threat to the safety of incarcerated individuals, 
17
and there is a serious threat to the general public 
18
that prisons may become incubators of community 
19
spread of communicable viral disease.

(1) In December 2009, President Obama re-
19
leased the National Strategy for Countering Biologi-
20
cal Threats, which listed as one of seven objectives 
21
‘‘Promote global health security: Increase the avail-

from outbreaks of infectious disease whether of nat-
1
ural, accidental, or deliberate origin’’. 
2
(2) In February 2014, the United States and 
3
nearly 30 other nations launched the Global Health 
4
Security Agenda (GHSA) to address several high- 
5
priority, global infectious disease threats. The 
6
GHSA is a multi-faceted, multi-country initiative in-
7
tended to accelerate partner countries’ measurable 
8
capabilities to achieve specific targets to prevent, de-
9
tect, and respond to infectious disease threats, 
10
whether naturally occurring, deliberate, or acci-
11
dental. 
12
(3) In 2015, the United Nations adopted the 
13
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which in-
14
clude specific reference to the importance of global 
15
health security as part of SDG 3 ‘‘ensure healthy 
16
lives and promote well-being for all at all ages’’ as 
17
follows: ‘‘strengthen the capacity of all countries, in 
18
particular developing countries, for early warning, 
19
risk reduction and management of national and 
20
global health risks’’. 
21
(4) On November 4, 2016, President Obama 
22
signed Executive Order 13747, ‘‘Advancing the 
23
Global Health Security Agenda to Achieve a World 
24
Safe and Secure from Infectious Disease Threats’’.

Meeting in Uganda, the United States and more 
2
than 40 GHSA member countries supported the 
3
‘‘Kampala Declaration’’ to extend the GHSA for an 
4
additional 5 years to 2024. 
5
(6) In December 2017, President Trump re-
6
leased the National Security Strategy, which in-
7
cludes the priority action: ‘‘Detect and contain bio-
8
threats at their source: We will work with other 
9
countries to detect and mitigate outbreaks early to 
10
prevent the spread of disease. We will encourage 
11
other countries to invest in basic health care systems 
12
and to strengthen global health security across the 
13
intersection of human and animal health to prevent 
14
infectious disease outbreaks’’.

(7) In September 2018, President Trump re-
16

17
cludes objectives to ‘‘strengthen global health secu-

SEC. 191513. FINDINGS. 
7
Congress finds the following: 
8
(1) Due to increasing population and popu-
9
lation density, human mobility, and ecological 
10
change, emerging infectious diseases pose a real and 
11
growing threat to global health security. 
12
(2) While vaccines can be the most effective 
13
tools to protect against infectious disease, the ab-
14
sence of vaccines for a new or emerging infectious 
15
disease with epidemic potential is a major health se-
16
curity threat globally, posing catastrophic potential 
17
human and economic costs. 
18
(3) The 1918 influenza pandemic infected 
19
500,000,000 people, or about one-third of the 
20
world’s 
population 
at 
the 
time, 
and 
killed 
21
50,000,000 people—more than died in the First 
22
World War. 
23
(4) The economic cost of an outbreak can be 
24
devastating. The estimated global cost today, should 
25
an outbreak of the scale of the 1918 influenza pan-
26

demic strike, is 5 percent of global gross domestic 
1
product. 
2
(5) Even regional outbreaks can have enormous 
3
human costs and substantially disrupt the global 
4
economy and cripple regional economies. The 2014 
5
Ebola outbreak in West Africa killed more than 
6
11,000 and cost $2,800,000,000 in losses in the af-
7
fected countries alone. 
8
(6) The ongoing novel coronavirus outbreak re-
9
flects the pressing need for quick and effective vac-
10
cine and countermeasure development. 
11
(7) While the need for vaccines to address 
12
emerging epidemic threats is acute, markets to drive 
13
the necessary development of vaccines to address 
14
them—a complex and expensive undertaking—are 
15
very often critically absent. Also absent are mecha-
16
nisms to ensure access to those vaccines by those 
17
who need them when they need them. 
18
(8) To address this global vulnerability and the 
19
deficit of political commitment, institutional capac-
20
ity, and funding, in 2017, several countries and pri-
21
vate partners launched the Coalition for Epidemic 
22
Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). CEPI’s mission 
23
is to stimulate, finance, and coordinate development 
24
of vaccines for high-priority, epidemic-potential 
25

•HR 6800 IH
threats in cases where traditional markets do not 
1
exist or cannot create sufficient demand. 
2
(9) Through funding of partnerships, CEPI 
3
seeks to bring priority vaccines candidates through 
4
the end of phase II clinical trials, as well as support 
5
vaccine platforms that can be rapidly deployed 
6
against emerging pathogens. 
7
(10) CEPI has funded multiple partners to de-
8
velop 
vaccine 
candidates 
against 
the 
novel 
9
coronavirus, responding to this urgent, global re-
10
quirement. 
11
(11) Support for and participation in CEPI is 
12
an important part of the United States own health 
13
security and biodefense and is in the national inter-
14
est, complementing the work of many Federal agen-
15
cies and providing significant value through global 
16
