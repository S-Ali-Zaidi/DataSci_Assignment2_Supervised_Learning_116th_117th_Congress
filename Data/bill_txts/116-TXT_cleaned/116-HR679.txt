‘‘Victims of Communism Memorial Day’’. 
Whereas the year 2017 marked 100 years since the Bolshevik

such infamous totalitarian dictators as Joseph Stalin, 
Mao Zedong, Ho Chi Minh, Pol Pot, Nicolae Ceausescu, 
the Castro brothers, and the Kim dynasty; 
Whereas Communist regimes worldwide have killed more than 
100 million people and subjected countless others to the 
worst and widest spread human rights abuses known to 
history, 
with 
victims 
representing 
many 
different 
ethnicities, creeds, and backgrounds; 
Whereas through false promises of equality and liberation, 
Communist regimes have as a matter of government pol-
icy robbed their own citizens of the rights of freedom of

through coercion, brutality, and fear; 
Whereas the bipartisan Congressional Caucus for the Victims 
of Communism stated publicly in 2018 that ‘‘Marx’s de-
fenders often say he cannot be held accountable for what 
Communist regimes did long after his life and death; but 
Marxist dictators who massacred their own people were 
applying Communist ideology to political practice’’; and 
Whereas President Donald Trump declared November 7, 
2017, as National Day for the Victims of Communism, 
condemning communism as a political philosophy ‘‘incom-
patible with liberty, prosperity, and the dignity of human 
life’’; and 
Whereas President Donald Trump issued a statement on No-
vember 7, 2018, honoring the ‘‘memory of the more than 
100 million people who have been killed and persecuted 
by communist totalitarian regimes’’ and reaffirming 
‘‘steadfast support for those who strive for peace, pros-
perity, and freedom around the world’’; and
