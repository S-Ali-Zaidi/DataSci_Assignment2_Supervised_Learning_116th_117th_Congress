RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for ‘‘Bike to Work Day’’ on May 17, 
2019. 
Whereas riding a bicycle is an excellent form of exercise that 
improves mental and physical health, and is part of a 
healthy lifestyle for men, women, and children to travel 
between home, school, and work; 
Whereas considering that bicycle riders and motor vehicle op-
erators share many of the same roads, it is important to 
ensure everyone’s safety by educating cyclists and motor-
ists regarding the proper and safe operation of bicycles; 
Whereas cycling deaths represent a disproportionate share of 
traffic deaths, and studies show measurable safety im-
provements result from investing in protected bike infra-
structure;

Whereas bicycling is an integral element in promoting energy- 
efficient and green-friendly technologies to enhance and 
sustain quality of life and to make communities more liv-
able; 
Whereas bicycle commuting is an effective means to improve 
air quality, reduce traffic congestion and noise, and con-
serve energy; 
Whereas bicycle commuting benefits both employees and em-
ployers through better employee health and fitness and a 
reduction in commuting, parking, and health care costs; 
Whereas companies and other organizations that participate 
in ‘‘Bike to Work Day’’ help to build morale and encour-
age camaraderie among their employees; 
Whereas when compared to sedentary employees, physically 
active employees are known to be typically more alert, 
take fewer sick days, and are more productive; 
Whereas biking to work provides an efficient and enjoyable 
means of getting much-needed regular exercise without 
having to set aside additional time before or after the 
workday to work out; 
Whereas people who bike to work typically arrive faster than 
their driving counterparts, particularly if the commute is 
a distance of three miles or less, and have equal or better 
commuter times for distances of five to seven miles in 
urban areas; 
Whereas a lack of incentives and knowledge about the bene-
fits of biking to work often discourages many employees 
from commuting by bicycle, even though more than half 
of United States workers live within five miles of their 
workplace;

Whereas many studies show the benefit to local economies 
from cyclists buying local goods and services when com-
munities support cycling infrastructure investments; and 
Whereas ‘‘Bike to Work’’ events, carried out on May 17th, 
encourage approximately 1 in 5 new participants to 
change their method of transportation by biking to work 
on a regular basis: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives hereby 
1
recognizes and supports ‘‘Bike to Work Day’’ on which 
2
companies, organizations, and individuals are encouraged 
3
to participate in a ‘‘Bike to Work’’ event.
