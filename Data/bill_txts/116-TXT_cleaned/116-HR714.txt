RESOLUTION 
Recognizing addiction as a disease and supporting efforts 
to prevent, treat, and destigmatize substance use dis-
order and addiction. 
Whereas substance use disorder is a diagnosis made based on 
a checklist of symptoms, is specific to the substance used, 
and may be mild, moderate, or severe; 
Whereas the American Society of Addiction Medicine defines 
‘‘addiction’’ as a chronic medical disease involving com-
plex interactions among brain circuits, genetics, the envi-
ronment, and an individual’s life experiences; 
Whereas people with addiction use substances or engage in 
behaviors that become compulsive and often continue de-
spite harmful consequences, symptoms that correspond to 
a moderate or severe substance use disorder;

Whereas recognizing addiction as a disease helps to 
destigmatize substance use disorder and addiction and 
acknowledges that substance use may be beyond an indi-
vidual’s control; 
Whereas certain factors place individuals at heightened risk 
of developing addiction; 
Whereas an individual’s environment and surroundings may 
intensify the risk of developing a substance use disorder; 
Whereas addiction may impact the mental and physical 
health of an individual, and mental and physical health 
disorders may contribute to substance use; 
Whereas diagnosing substance use and mental health dis-
orders is a complex process that requires consultation 
with appropriate professionals and experts; 
Whereas substance use by an individual with addiction may 
dominate all aspects of that individual’s life and, there-
fore, the biological, psychological, and social aspects of 
individuals diagnosed with substance use disorder should 
be treated and addressed through a mutually agreed- 
upon plan of action to accommodate the individual needs 
of the patient; 
Whereas treatment approaches for substance use disorder 
that target the symptoms and drivers of alcohol and drug 
use, as well as the mental health effects of such use, are 
needed; 
Whereas treatment approaches for substance use disorder 
that address the biological, psychological, and social as-
pects of the disorder are necessary for individuals to 
make a full recovery; 
Whereas while some treatment options may differ for dif-
ferent substance use disorders, other interventions such

as motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral 
therapy are effective regardless of the substance or be-
havior; and 
Whereas individuals with substance use disorder may lack fi-
nancial, social, emotional, or other resources necessary to 
secure treatment, even if such individuals recognize the 
need for treatment: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) recognizes addiction as a treatable, chronic

medical 
disease 
involving 
complex 
interactions 
3
among brain circuits, genetics, the environment, and 
4
an individual’s life experiences; 
5
(2) supports evidence-based treatment ap-
6
proaches for substance use disorder that address the 
7
biological, psychological, and social aspects of the 
8
disorder; and 
9
(3) supports efforts to prevent and destigmatize 
10
substance use disorder and addiction.
