(1) The Sport Fish Restoration and Boating 
1
Trust Fund (Trust Fund) was established in 1950 
2
to provide dedicated funding for aquatic conserva-
3
tion and boating safety. 
4
(2) The Trust Fund is a user fee-public benefit 
5
system funded through motorboat fuel tax receipts, 
6
import duties, and excise taxes on small engines, 
7
fishing equipment, and electric motors. 
8
(3) The Trust Fund provides nearly $650 mil-
9
lion annually for recreational infrastructure projects, 
10
coastal wetlands restoration, and boating safety and 
11
conservation programs in all 50 States. 
12
(4) Since 2010, more than 28,000 acres of 
13
habitats have been restored and improved through-
14
out coastal wetland ecosystems—which not only 
15
serve a critical role in conservation but provide a sig-
16
nificant economic impact to coastal communities. 
17
(5) The recreational boating and angling com-
18
munity, as well as State agencies, recognize the sig-
19
nificant increase in the use of non-motorized, 
20
human-propelled vessels in recent years. Growth of 
21
the human-propelled vessel community has required 
22
United States Coast Guard and State agencies to 
23
use significant resources to address human-propelled 
24
infrastructure, boating safety, law enforcement, and
