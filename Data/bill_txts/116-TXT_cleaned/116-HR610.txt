RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the designation of September 29, 
2019, as National Urban Wildlife Refuge Day. 
Whereas today over 80 percent of Americans live in or near 
cities with limited opportunities to access nature or expe-
rience outdoor recreation; 
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
states that youth ages 8 to 18 spend on average between 
6 to 9 hours a day in front of screens; 
Whereas the National Wildlife Refuge System, within the 
United States Fish and Wildlife Service, manages 567 
national wildlife refuges, a national network of lands and 
waters managed for the benefit of America’s fish, wildlife, 
and plants;

Whereas national wildlife refuges provide opportunities for 
children and people of all ages to discover and gain a 
greater appreciation for the natural world and the fact 
that there is a refuge located within a 1-hour drive of 
every metropolitan area in the United States; 
Whereas the Urban Wildlife Conservation Program within the 
United States Fish and Wildlife Service is an innovative 
model that centers on introducing Americans living in 
densely populated areas to the over 100 national wildlife 
refuges near urban areas and that provides a strategic 
opportunity to promote wildlife conservation and enjoy-
ment of hunting, fishing, and other wildlife-dependent 
recreation in the heart of where people live; 
Whereas urban wildlife refuges enhance and celebrate the 
grassroots efforts of local communities to protect local 
watersheds and ecosystems; 
Whereas the Urban Wildlife Conservation Program focuses 
on public-private partnerships to deliver greater wildlife 
conservation and access to recreation, including outdoor 
traditions like hunting and fishing, both on and off na-
tional wildlife refuges, collaborating and aligning with 
local efforts to enhance the visitor experience; 
Whereas by being a good neighbor, exploring community-cen-
tered approaches to address local needs, reaching out to 
the next generation of anglers and hunters, and providing 
infrastructure and safe access, the Urban Wildlife Con-
servation Program works to empower local organizations, 
cities, and towns across the country to support innova-
tive, community-based conservation; and
