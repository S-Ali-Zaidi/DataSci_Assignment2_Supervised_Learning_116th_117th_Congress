A BILL 
To eliminate the requirement that, to be eligible for foster 
care maintenance payments, a child would have been 
eligible for aid under the former program of Aid to 
Families with Dependent Children at the time of removal 
from the home. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Look-back Elimination 
4
Act of 2019’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

The Congress finds as follows:

•HR 4472 IH
(1) As part of President Franklin Delano Roo-
1
sevelt’s New Deal, the Social Security Act of 1935 
2
included the creation of the Aid to Dependent Chil-
3
dren program as a way to provide Federal support 
4
to poor children. Over time, this program became 
5
the Aid to Families with Dependent Children 
6
(AFDC) program and provided assistance to strug-
7
gling families for over 60 years. 
8
(2) Part E of title IV of the Social Security Act 
9
provides primary Federal funding for child welfare 
10
services. Under that part, the Federal Government 
11
pays a portion of the cost of providing Federal foster 
12
care and adoption assistance benefits for eligible 
13
children. 
14
(3) In 1996, when Congress replaced the AFDC 
15
program with the Temporary Assistance for Needy 
16
Families (TANF) program, Congress also fixed the 
17
income eligibility requirement for Federal foster care 
18
and adoption assistance benefits at a level based on 
19
the income thresholds established by the States 
20
under their former AFDC programs. This income 
21
eligibility requirement is now commonly referred to 
22
as the ‘‘AFDC look-back standard’’. 
23
(4) At that time, many States had established 
24
very strict household income requirements in order 
25
03:12 Sep 27, 2019
H4472
3 
•HR 4472 IH
for children to be eligible for AFDC benefits. As a 
1
result of this very strict requirement, many children 
2
in the Federal foster care and adoption assistance 
3
programs are ineligible to receive a wide range of 
4
Federal benefits, services, and activities. For exam-
5
ple, this outdated, restrictive standard prevents the 
6
State of Georgia from providing assistance to more 
7
than half of the children in the child welfare system. 
8
(5) Forced to adhere to a stagnant standard, 
9
States increasingly struggle to administer Federal 
10
foster care and adoption assistance programs and 
11
provide services to those children most in need. As 
12
inflation increases, fewer children are eligible to re-
13
ceive Federal benefits, and States struggle to pro-
14
vide services from other, limited local and State re-
15
sources. 
16
(6) Although the AFDC look-back standard still 
17
applies to the Federal foster care program, the Fos-
18
tering Connections to Success and Increasing Adop-
19
tions Act of 2008 completely eliminated the AFDC 
20
look-back standard in the Federal adoption assist-
21
ance program in 2018.

SEC. 4. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS. 
17
It is the sense of the Congress that— 
18
(1) the AFDC eligibility requirement for Fed-
19
eral foster care and adoption assistance benefits 
20
should be eliminated and replaced with income eligi-
21
bility standards that are based on modern, balanced 
22
criteria that treat all children equally; and 
23
(2) the Secretary of Health and Human Serv-
24
ices should collaborate with Members of Congress
