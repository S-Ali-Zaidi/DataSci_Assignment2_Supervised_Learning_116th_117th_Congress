A BILL 
To amend the District of Columbia Home Rule Act to pro-
vide for a uniform 60-day period for Congress to review 
laws of the District of Columbia before such laws may 
take effect, to permit Congress to use the authorities 
and procedures available under such Act for the consider-
ation and enactment of resolutions of disapproval of laws 
of the District of Columbia to disapprove specific provi-
sions of such laws, to clarify the expedited procedures 
available under such Act for the consideration of such

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘District of Columbia 
4
Home Rule Improvement Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
6
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) The District of Columbia was granted lim-
8
ited autonomy in 1973 by Congress, who at the time 
9
did not wish to intervene in the day-to-day govern-
10
ance of the city. 
11
(2) This grant of limited autonomy by Congress 
12
may be revoked by Congress at any time. 
13
(3) Article 1, section 8, clause 17 of the United 
14
States Constitution provides Congress with the ex-
15
clusive jurisdiction over the District of Columbia. 
16
(4) This clause was included for specific rea-
17
sons, notably the fact that the operation of the seat 
18
of the Federal Government of the United States, 
19
whose laws affect approximately 330 million Ameri-
20
cans, should not be impeded by local ordinances, ac-
21
tions, or taxation. 
22
(5) The Framers of the Constitution had good 
23
reason for this concern, having witnessed the reluc-
24
tance of local authorities to police disorderly conduct

by protestors in June of 1783, conduct that forced 
1
the adjournment of the Congress and the flight of 
2
its members into neighboring States. 
3
(6) James Madison wrote in Federalist No. 43, 
4
‘‘The indispensable necessity of compleat authority 
5
at the seat of Government carries its own evidence 
6
with it. It is a power exercised by every Legislature 
7
of the Union, I might say of the world, by virtue of 
8
its general supremacy. Without it, not only the pub-
9
lic authority might be insulted and its proceedings 
10
be interrupted, with impunity; but a dependence of 
11
the members of the general Government, on the 
12
State comprehending the seat of the Government for 
13
protection in the exercise of their duty, might bring 
14
on the national councils an imputation of awe or in-
15
fluence, equally dishonorable to the Government, and 
16
dissatisfactory to the other members of the confed-
17
eracy’’. 
18
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of Con-
19
gress that— 
20
(1) Congress is the proper, constitutionally 
21
mandated sovereign over the District of Columbia 
22
and that increasing congressional oversight of the 
23
District is a wise course, in particular improving the 
24
disapproval mechanisms of the District of Columbia
