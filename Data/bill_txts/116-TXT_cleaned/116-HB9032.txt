3
MUNIST PARTY CONNECTIONS AND INTENT 
4
TO ENGAGE IN UNLAWFUL ACTIVITIES. 
5
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) The Chinese Communist Party has an ex-
7
plicit and subversive interest in gaining access to 
8
and influence over U.S. political activity. 
9
(2) In a July 2020 speech, Director of the Fed-
10
eral Bureau of Investigations Chris Wray said that 
11
‘‘Beijing is engaged in a highly sophisticated malign 
12
foreign influence campaign’’ with efforts that involve 
13
‘‘subversive, undeclared, criminal, or coercive at-
14
tempts to sway our government’s policies, distort our 
15
country’s public discourse, and undermine con-
16
fidence in our democratic processes and values’’. 
17
(3) There have been several instances and in-
18
vestigations of Chinese operatives developing exten-
19
sive ties and employment with U.S. elected officials, 
20
both senior and junior. 
21
(4) These same operatives, mostly Chinese na-
22
tionals, have been deployed to infiltrate political op-
23
erations by the main civilian spy agency of their 
24
home country as a means to gain influence over de-

cision-makers and gain access to classified informa-
1
tion. 
2
(5) These instances demonstrate a devoted 
3
strategy of China that takes years, or sometimes 
4
decades, to knowingly gain access, influence, or in-
5
formation. 
6
(6) To protect classified information and pre-
7
vent seditious influence over elected officials, Con-
8
gress must act to develop stronger oversight with re-
9
spect to the foreign involvement of covered individ-
10
uals.
