(a) IN GENERAL.—Part A of title IV of the Elemen-

4

‘‘SEC. 4131. FINDINGS. 
9
‘‘The Congress finds the following: 
10
‘‘(1) The Surgeon General of the Public Health 
11
Service has found that 1 in 5 children has a 
12
diagnosable mental disorder and 1 in 10 children 
13
and adolescents suffer from mental illness severe 
14
enough to cause some level of impairment. However, 
15
75 to 80 percent of children in need of mental 
16
health services do not receive needed treatment. The 
17
short- and long-term consequences of untreated 
18
childhood mental disorders are costly, in both human 
19
and fiscal terms. 
20
‘‘(2) Thirty-seven percent of students with a 
21
mental health condition age 14 and older drop out 
22
of school—the highest dropout rate of any disability 
23
group. 
24

•HR 4525 IH
‘‘(3) Fifty percent of all lifetimes cases of men-
1
tal illness begin by the age of 14 and 75 percent by 
2
age 24. 
3
‘‘(4) In June 2010, the American Academy of 
4
Pediatrics called for all pediatricians to screen chil-
5
dren and adolescents for mental illness and sub-
6
stance use. 
7
‘‘(5) Just over half (50.6 percent) of children 
8
with a mental health condition aged 8–15 received 
9
mental health services in the previous year. 
10
‘‘(6) African Americans and Hispanic Ameri-
11
cans each use mental health services at about one- 
12
half the rate of Caucasian Americans and Asian 
13
Americans at about one-third the rate. 
14
‘‘(7) School counselors, school social workers, 
15
school psychologists, other qualified psychologists, 
16
and child and adolescent psychiatrists are critically 
17
needed to help these children and to provide a vari-
18
ety of crucial support services as 70–80 percent of 
19
children and adolescents who receive mental health 
20
services access these services in school settings. 
21
‘‘(8) Across the United States, there are insuffi-
22
cient resources for school-based counseling profes-
23
sionals, and often students do not get the help they 
24
need. The 2017 national average ratio of students to

•HR 4525 IH
school counselors in elementary and secondary 
1
schools was 482 to 1. 
2
‘‘(9) United States public schools need more 
3
mental health professionals because participation in 
4
the use of school-based mental health centers 
5
(SBHC) was positively associated with increases in 
6
grade point average (GPA) and attendance. 
7
‘‘(10) According to the leading counseling, guid-
8
ance, and mental health organizations, including the 
9
American School Counselor Association, the Na-
10
tional Association of Social Psychologists, the Na-
11
tional Association of Social Workers, and the School 
12
Social Work Association of America, the maximum 
13
recommended ratio of— 
14
‘‘(A) students to school counselors is 250 
15
to 1; 
16
‘‘(B) students to school psychologists is 
17
500 to 700 to 1; and 
18
‘‘(C) students to school social workers is 
19
250 to 1. 
20
‘‘(11) A recent study revealed a national aver-
21
age ratio of 1,653 students per school psychologist, 
22
despite the 1:500–700 recommendation from the 
23
National Association of Social Psychologists. This 
24
deficit is further compounded by studies predicting 
25
04:32 Oct 02, 2019
H4525
5 
•HR 4525 IH
a 2–4 percent shortage of school psychologists over 
1
the next 10 years due to retirement. In some 
2
schools, there are no school-based mental health and 
3
student service providers available to assist students 
4
in times of crisis, or at any other time. 
5
‘‘(12) Counselor-to-student ratios in 35 States 
6
exceed 1:400 despite recommendations from the 
7
American School Counselor Association for a 1:250 
8
ratio. Only three States—Vermont, Wyoming & New 
9
Hampshire—meet the recommended ratio. This 
10
shortage occurs during a time when the National 
11
Center on Education Statistics forecasts that the 
12
Nation’s number of public school students (Pre-K to 
13
12th) will grow by 7 percent between 2011 and 
14
2022, particularly in States that already spend the 
15
least money per student. 
16
‘‘(13) Model programs using school-based men-
17
tal health and student service providers have positive 
18
effects on emotional, behavioral and academic out-
19
comes, such as reductions in aggressive and disrup-
20
tive behavior, referrals to the principal’s office, the 
21
use of weapons, force, or threats, and increased stu-
22
dents’ feelings of safety. Studies also find that men-
23
