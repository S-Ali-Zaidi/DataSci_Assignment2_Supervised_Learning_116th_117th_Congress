RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for the designation of May 15, 2019, 
as ‘‘National Senior Fraud Awareness Day’’ to raise 
awareness about the barrage of fraud attempts that sen-
iors face, to encourage the implementation of policies 
to prevent these scams from happening, and to improve

geting older women, home repair scams, fraudulent in-
vestment schemes, and reverse mortgage scams; 
Whereas other types of fraud perpetrated against senior citi-
zens include health care fraud, health insurance fraud, 
counterfeit prescription drug fraud, funeral and cemetery 
fraud, ‘‘anti-aging’’ product fraud, telemarketing fraud, 
and internet fraud; 
Whereas the life savings of senior citizens who have saved for 
retirement are tempting targets for these methods of 
fraud and deception; 
Whereas the ease of access for criminals to contact seniors 
through the internet and telephone increases as more cre-
ative schemes emerge; 
Whereas according to the Consumer Sentinel Network Data 
Book 2018 released by the Federal Trade Commission, 
people aged 60 years and older were defrauded of $391 
million during 2018, with the median loss to defrauded 
victims aged 80 and older averaging $1,700 per person, 
more than three times the average amount lost by those 
aged between 50 and 59 years old; 
Whereas senior fraud is underreported by victims due to em-
barrassment and lack of information about where to re-
port fraud; and 
Whereas May 15, 2019, is an appropriate day to establish as 
‘‘National Senior Fraud Awareness Day’’: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
