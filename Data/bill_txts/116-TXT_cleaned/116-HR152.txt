RESOLUTION 
Calling for a formal end of the Korean war. 
Whereas the Korean war remains one of the world’s longest 
ongoing armed conflicts, in which the Democratic Peo-
ple’s Republic of Korea (North Korea), the Republic of 
Korea (South Korea), the United States, and 20 other 
nations have suffered hundreds of thousands of casualties 
and losses, and millions of civilians killed and wounded; 
Whereas, on June 25, 1950, the armed forces of North Korea 
attacked South Korea, an action which the United Na-
tions Security Council determined constituted a breach of

•HRES 152 IH 
the peace under chapter VII of the United Nations Char-
ter, after which the United States militarily intervened in 
the conflict in defense of South Korea; 
Whereas, on July 27, 1953, the commander in chief of the 
United Nations Command signed an Armistice Agree-
ment with the supreme commander of the North Korean 
People’s Army and the commander of the Chinese Peo-
ple’s Volunteers, aiming, by its terms, to ‘‘insure a com-
plete cessation of hostilities and of all acts of armed force 
in Korea until a final peaceful settlement is achieved’’; 
Whereas the Armistice Agreement, by its terms, neither for-
mally ended the war nor represented a final peaceful set-
tlement; 
Whereas the persistence of a state of war represents a con-
stant risk and threat to the national security of the 
United States and its allies; 
Whereas in Article III of the Mutual Defense Treaty between 
the United States of America and the Republic of Korea, 
signed at Washington on October 1, 1953, and still in 
force today, the United States recognized that an armed 
attack on South Korea would be dangerous to the peace 
and safety of the United States, and declared that the 
United States would act in accordance with its constitu-
tional principles to meet the common danger of such an 
armed attack; 
Whereas unprovoked military action against North Korea 
would pose extraordinary risks to the United States, 
United States troops and citizens in the region, United 
States allies, and security in Northeast Asia and would 
require explicit authorization by Congress under article I 
of the United States Constitution;

Whereas, on April 27, 2018, in Panmunjom, the leaders of 
South Korea and North Korea ‘‘solemnly declared’’ that 
‘‘there will be no more war and a new era of peace has 
begun on the Korean peninsula’’, and committed ‘‘to de-
clare the end of war’’ on the Korean peninsula 65 years 
after the signing of the Armistice Agreement, and further 
committing to actively promote meetings involving the 
United States ‘‘with a view to replacing the Armistice 
Agreement with a peace agreement and establishing a 
permanent and solid peace regime’’; 
Whereas, on June 12, 2018, in Singapore, the leaders of the 
United States and North Korea committed ‘‘to establish 
new relations in accordance with the desire of the peoples 
of the two countries for peace and prosperity’’; 
Whereas, on September 25, 2018, President of South Korea 
Moon Jae-in publicly affirmed that it is ‘‘simply not 
true’’ that an end-of-war declaration would affect the sta-
tus of the United Nations Command or of United States 
Forces in Korea, and further stated that the stationing 
of United States Forces in Korea ‘‘is simply a matter for 
the ROK–U.S. alliance to decide regardless of a declara-
tion to end the Korean war or the signing of a peace 
treaty’’; 
Whereas the failure to come to a final peace settlement on 
the Korean peninsula has exerted long-term negative 
pressures on human rights and humanitarian conditions, 
such as the restriction of civil liberties and redirection of 
national resources to defense and excessive military 
spending rather than to the livelihoods of Americans and 
the Korean peoples; 
Whereas the United Nations Security Council has determined 
that the ongoing nuclear- and ballistic-missile-related ac-

tivities of North Korea continue to pose a threat to inter-
national peace and security; 
Whereas the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear 
Weapons (NPT) remains a cornerstone of the nuclear 
nonproliferation regime and the United States has a duty 
to seek universal adherence to and compliance with the 
NPT; 
Whereas an end to the state of war would not legally imply 
recognition of North Korea as a nuclear weapons state, 
as the only states that can be recognized as such under 
the NPT are those which have ‘‘manufactured and ex-
ploded a nuclear weapon or other nuclear explosive device 
prior to January 1, 1967’’; and 
Whereas Special Representative for North Korea Stephen 
Biegun stated on January 31, 2019, that ‘‘the Trump 
administration is ready to end this war’’, that ‘‘We are 
not going to invade North Korea’’, and that ‘‘We are not 
seeking to topple the North Korean regime’’: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) pays tribute to the sacrifices of the veterans 
2
of the Korean war, its victims, and the families di-
3
vided since the initial outbreak of war; 
4
(2) calls for continued cooperative efforts to re-

(4) affirms that neither a declaration regarding 
1
the end of the Korean war nor a final peaceful set-
2
tlement by itself would have any legal effect on the 
3
commitments set forth in the 1953 Mutual Defense 
4
Treaty between the United States of America and 
5
the Republic of Korea, which by its terms is set to 
6
‘‘remain in force indefinitely’’ and which requires the 
7
United States to respond immediately and firmly to 
8
the common danger that any armed attack on South 
9
Korea would pose to both countries; 
10
(5) affirms its strong agreement with the state-
11
ment of the President of South Korea Moon Jae-in 
12
that questions about the stationing of United States 
13
Armed Forces in South Korea is ultimately a matter 
14
for the United States and South Korea to decide to-
15
gether regardless of whether a declaration to end the 
16
Korean war or any final peaceful settlement is 
17
achieved; 
18
(6) affirms that the United States does not 
19
seek armed conflict with North Korea; 
20
(7) would welcome a statement by President 
21
Trump, in coordination with South Korea, declaring 
22
the end of the state of war with North Korea;

among the United States, South Korea, and North

Korea to address the ongoing nuclear- and ballistic-

2
(9) calls for the conclusion of a binding peace 
3
agreement constituting a formal and final end to the 
4
state of war between North Korea, South Korea, 
5
and the United States, and calls for serious, urgent 
6
diplomatic engagement in pursuit of that goal; 
7
(10) affirms the vital role that women and 
8
other marginalized groups who would be particularly 
9
vulnerable to any resumption of active hostilities 
10
must play in building a lasting, sustainable, and 
11
peaceful settlement, and calls on all parties to take 
12
greater steps to include women and civil society in 
13
ongoing discussions, as outlined in the Women, 
14
Peace, and Security Act of 2017; 
15
(11) affirms that the denuclearization of the 
16
Korean peninsula and a final peaceful settlement 
17
cannot be achieved absent meaningful, reciprocal ac-
18
tions and confidence-building measures among all 
19
parties; and

State, or their designees, to detail for Congress and

the American people a clear roadmap for achieving
