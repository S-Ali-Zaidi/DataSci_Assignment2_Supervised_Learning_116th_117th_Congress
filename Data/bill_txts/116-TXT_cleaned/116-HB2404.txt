promoting trade and commerce, travel, communica-
1
tions, and cultural, academic, and scientific ex-
2
changes;

(2) extension to Cuba of unconditional normal 
4
trade relations treatment would assist Cuba in devel-
5
oping its economy based on free market principles 
6
and becoming competitive in the global marketplace; 
7
(3) expanding bilateral trade relations is likely 
8
to promote further progress in Cuba on human 
9
rights and democratic rule and assist Cuba in adopt-
10
ing regional and world trading rules and principles;

13
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in 
14

15
