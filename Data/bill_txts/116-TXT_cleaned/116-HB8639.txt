Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Mental Health Justice 
4
Act of 2020’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Needless institutionalization (including in 
8
psychiatric hospitals) of people with disabilities is 
9
generally a violation of the Americans with Disabil-
10
ities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.), and the 
11
failure to provide sufficient community-based serv-
12
ices (such as supported housing, assertive commu-
13
nity treatment, mobile crisis, peer support, and sup-
14
ported employment) has resulted in needless institu-
15
tionalization as well as incarceration of persons with 
16
mental illness or an intellectual or developmental 
17
disability. 
18
(2) In the landmark 1999 Supreme Court case 
19
Olmstead v. L.C., the Supreme Court ruled that the 
20
‘‘unjustified institutional isolation of persons with 
21
disabilities is a form of discrimination’’ prohibited by 
22
the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 
23
U.S.C. 12101 et seq.). 
24
18:35 Nov 06, 2020
H8639

•HR 8639 IH
(3) Regulations promulgated by the Attorney 
1
General in 1991 affirm that title II of the Ameri-
2
cans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12131 
3
et seq.) requires public entities to ‘‘administer serv-
4
ices, programs, and activities in the most integrated 
5
setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individ-
6
uals with disabilities’’ (28 C.F.R. 35.130(d)). The 
7
regulation defines ‘‘the most integrated setting’’ as 
8
one that ‘‘enables individuals with disabilities to 
9
interact with nondisabled persons to the fullest ex-
10
tent possible’’ (28 C.F.R. pt. 35, App. B). 
11
(4) Yet today, persons with a mental illness or 
12
an intellectual or developmental disability are more 
13
likely to be incarcerated and to be subject to exces-
14
sive use of force by law enforcement officers: 
15
(A) One out of every four of the deaths 
16
caused by law enforcement officers is a person 
17
with mental illness. 
18
(B) Persons with a mental illness or an in-
19
tellectual or developmental disability are often 
20
charged with minor, nonviolent offenses. For 
21
many of these persons, arrest and incarceration 
22
could have been avoided if they had access to 
23
intensive community-based services and stable 
24
housing. 
25

•HR 8639 IH
(5) Many of the police encounters that lead to 
1
the incarceration (and in too many cases, death) of 
2
people with mental illness or an intellectual or devel-
3
opmental disability could be avoided by having in 
4
place systems that ensure that calls to 911 or to law 
5
enforcement result in dispatch of mental health pro-
6
fessionals, peer support workers, or others rather 
7
than law enforcement officers. 
8
(6) Many people who are incarcerated would be 
9
better served in community services. If there were 
10
sufficient community services, and persons with 
11
mental illness or an intellectual or developmental 
12
disability were connected to those services rather 
13
than being arrested, thousands of people with men-
14
tal illness or an intellectual or developmental dis-
15
ability would avoid needless admissions to hospitals 
16
or jails. Further, jails and hospitals would experi-
17
ence less crowding.
