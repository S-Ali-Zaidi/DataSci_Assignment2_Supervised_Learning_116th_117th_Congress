RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for designation of the week of November 
3 through 9, 2019, as National Family Service Learning 
Week. 
Whereas the term ‘‘family service learning’’ means a method 
under which children and families learn and solve prob-
lems together in a multigenerational approach, with ac-
tive participation in thoughtfully organized service that— 
(1) is conducted in and meets the needs of their 
community; 
(2) is focused on children and families solving com-
munity issues together; 
(3) applies college and career readiness skills for 
children and relevant workforce training skills for adults;

(4) is coordinated with an elementary school, sec-
ondary school, institution of higher education, or family- 
community organization, and the community; 
Whereas family service learning is— 
(1) multigenerational learning that involves parents, 
children, caregivers, and extended family members in 
shared learning experiences in both physical and digital 
environments; 
(2) integrated into and enhances the academic 
achievement of the children or the educational compo-
nents of a family service program in which the families 
may be enrolled; and 
(3) encompasses skills such as investigation, plan-
ning and preparation, action, reflection, demonstration of 
results, and sustainability; 
Whereas family service learning has been shown to have posi-
tive two-generational effects and invests families in their 
communities to improve both economic and societal well- 
being; 
Whereas, through service learning, children and families are 
offered the opportunity to solve community issues and 
learn together, thereby enabling the development of life 
and career skills, such as flexibility and adaptability, ini-
tiative and self-direction, social and cross-cultural skills, 
productivity and accountability, and leadership and re-
sponsibility; 
Whereas family service learning activities provide opportuni-
ties for families to improve essential skills such as organi-
zation, research, planning, reading and writing, tech-
nology, teamwork, and sharing;

Whereas families participating together in service are af-
forded quality time learning about their communities; 
Whereas adults engaged in family service learning serve as 
positive role models for their children; 
Whereas service learning projects enable low-income families 
to build substantive connections with their community, 
develop a stronger sense of self-worth, experience a re-
duction in social isolation, and improve parenting skills; 
Whereas service learning has added benefits for non-native- 
English speakers as participation helps them to feel less 
like outsiders and more accepted in the United States; 
Whereas family service learning is particularly important for 
families at risk because it provides the opportunity for 
marginalized populations to develop future leadership op-
portunities, civic engagement, and the capacity to more 
effectively advocate for children’s and families’ needs; 
and 
Whereas the value that parents place on civic engagement 
and relationships within the community has been shown 
to transfer to the child who, in turn, replicates values 
such as responsibility, empathy, and caring for others: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
