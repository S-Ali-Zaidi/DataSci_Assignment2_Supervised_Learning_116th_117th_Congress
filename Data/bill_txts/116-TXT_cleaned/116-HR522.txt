RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the production of oil and natural gas is essential to 
the economy and well-being of the United States, and 
that addressing energy needs requires cooperation in-
stead of coercion. 
Whereas public leaders have attempted to coerce damages 
from energy companies with frivolous lawsuits and inves-
tigations, including— 
(1) on July 24, 2013, the Southeast Louisiana 
Flood Protection Authority-East filed lawsuits against 
nearly 100 energy companies, alleging liability for flood-
ing in New Orleans;

(2) on April 7, 2016, Louisiana Governor John Bel 
Edwards and his administration joined in 39 lawsuits 
against energy companies, alleging liability for damages 
to the coast of Louisiana; 
(3) on September 21, 2016, Governor John Bel 
Edwards sent letters to 16 Louisiana parishes directing 
them to file similar lawsuits against energy companies for 
alleged damages; 4 additional parishes have since joined 
the lawsuits; and 
(4) on March 29, 2019, the city of New Orleans 
filed lawsuits against 11 energy companies, alleging li-
ability for damages to the coast of Louisiana; 
Whereas these actions are not in the spirit of good govern-
ance; 
Whereas these actions create more problems than they intend 
to fix; 
Whereas these unseemly tactics are nothing more than a cyn-
ical attempt to use the power of government to shake 
down energy companies in order to fund public works; 
Whereas these actions deter the safe development of the vast 
natural resources of the United States, and hinder eco-
nomic growth; 
Whereas the United States has thrived and tackled its great-
est challenges by fostering a cooperative spirit with busi-
ness and industry; 
Whereas Federal revenues generated from mineral production 
contribute to the conservation and preservation of na-
tional parks and other public lands; 
Whereas without the revenues generated by oil and gas pro-
duction, coastal restoration projects in Louisiana would 
not be possible;

•HRES 522 IH 
Whereas the oil and natural gas industries are responsible for 
millions of American jobs and for adding trillions of dol-
lars to the economy; 
Whereas the production of oil and natural gas has provided 
affordable and reliable sources of energy to billions of 
people around the world; 
Whereas American innovation and ingenuity has made the 
United States the greatest energy producer in the world; 
and 
Whereas increased production of domestic energy sources is 
vital to American energy independence, national security, 
and the economy: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-
1
resentatives that— 
2
(1) the production of oil and natural gas is crit-
3
ical to the continued prosperity of the United States 
4
economy, its national security, and its people; 
5
(2) the Federal Government and public leaders 
6
throughout the United States should promote poli-
7
cies that encourage greater energy production and 
8
independence; and 
9
(3) public leaders should work in a spirit of 
10
good faith and cooperation with energy producers to 
11
address the energy needs and problems facing the 
12
United States, rather than in a spirit of coercion 
13
and division.
