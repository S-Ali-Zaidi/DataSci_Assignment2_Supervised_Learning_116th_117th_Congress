A BILL 
To protect the rights of passengers with disabilities in air 
transportation, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Air Carrier Access 
4
Amendments Act of 2019’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
6
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following find-
7
ings: 
8
(1) In 1986, President Ronald Reagan signed 
9
the Air Carrier Access Act of 1986 (Public Law 99– 
10
01:11 Mar 20, 2019
H1549
2 
•HR 1549 IH
435; 100 Stat. 1080), adding a provision now codi-
1
fied in section 41705 of title 49, United States Code 
2
(in this section referred to as the ‘‘ACAA’’), prohib-
3
iting disability-based discrimination in air transpor-
4
tation. 
5
(2) Despite progress, many individuals with dis-
6
abilities, including veterans, still encounter signifi-
7
cant barriers while traveling in air transportation, 
8
such as— 
9
(A) damaged assistive devices; 
10
(B) inaccessible aircraft, lavatories, and 
11
communication media; 
12
(C) delayed assistance; 
13
(D) inequitable treatment of service ani-
14
mals; 
15
(E) inadequate disability cultural com-
16
petency; and 
17
(F) a lack of suitable seating accommoda-
18
tions. 
19
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—The following is the sense 
20
of Congress: 
21
(1) Access for individuals with disabilities in air 
22
transportation must move into the 21st century. 
23
Otherwise, individuals with disabilities will be left 
24
behind and unable to compete in today’s job market

or enjoy the opportunities available to other citizens 
1
of the United States. 
2
(2) Aircraft must be designed to accommodate 
3
individuals with disabilities and air carriers must ac-
4
quire aircraft that meet broad accessibility stand-
5
ards. 
6
(3) The ACAA must be updated to improve ac-
7
cess to air transportation for individuals with dis-
8
abilities. Legislation is necessary for the moderniza-
9
tion of standards and requirements that will 
10
strengthen accessibility in air transportation, includ-
11
ing the accessibility of aircraft. 
12
(4) The Department of Transportation and the 
13
Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compli-
14
ance Board (in this section referred to as the ‘‘Ac-
15
cess Board’’) must promulgate regulations to ensure 
16
that all passengers with disabilities receive— 
17
(A) prompt and effective boarding, deplan-
18
ing, and connections between flights; 
19
(B) accommodations, including nonstan-
20
dard accommodations, that safely facilitate air 
21
travel; and 
22
(C) better access to airport facilities, in-
23
cluding the provision of visually accessible an-
24

•HR 1549 IH
nouncements and full and equal access to aural 
1
communications. 
2
(5) Legislation is necessary to ensure that indi-
3
viduals with disabilities have adequate remedies 
4
available when air carriers violate the ACAA (includ-
5
ing regulations prescribed under the ACAA). 
6
(6) Unlike other civil rights statutes, the ACAA 
7
does not contain a private right of action, which is 
8
critical to the enforcement of civil rights statutes. 
9
Legislation is necessary to correct this anomaly.
