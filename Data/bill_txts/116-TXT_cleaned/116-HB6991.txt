•HR 6991 IH
(1) The COVID–19 global pandemic has high-
1
lighted the need for United States leadership to ad-
2
dress the full range of international security chal-
3
lenges, which the Government of the United States 
4
can do by reaffirming its steadfast commitment to 
5
those mutually beneficial treaties and agreements 
6
forged with its European and Indo-Pacific allies, 
7
along with other states parties. 
8
(2) For more than 70 years, the United States 
9
has shown a bipartisan commitment to the North 
10
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), specifically to 
11
the principle of collective defense enshrined in Arti-
12
cle 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, signed at Wash-
13
ington April 4, 1949. 
14
(3) Section 1242 of the National Defense Au-
15
thorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 (Public Law 
16
116–92) prohibited the use of funds for the United 
17
States withdrawal from the North Atlantic Treaty in 
18
recognition that the NATO alliance remains a cor-
19
nerstone for peace and prosperity throughout the 
20
world. 
21
(4) On January 22, 2019, the House of Rep-
22
resentatives passed H.R. 676 (116th Congress) on a 
23
357–22 vote, prohibiting the use of funds for the 
24
United States withdrawal from the North Atlantic

Treaty, and on December 17, 2019, the Committee 
1
on Foreign Relations of the Senate reported out S.J. 
2
Res. 4 (116th Congress), which if enacted into law, 
3
would require approval of two-thirds of the Senate, 
4
or both Houses of Congress, before the President 
5
could withdraw the United States from the treaty. 
6
(5) The Treaty on Open Skies, signed at Hel-
7
sinki March 24, 1992, provides a critical confidence- 
8
building measure for Euro-Atlantic security to the 
9
mutual benefit of the 34 States Parties to the trea-
10
ty, and the Open Skies Consultative Commission 
11
(OSCC) is one of the few remaining operational dip-
12
lomatic forums from which the United States can 
13
engage with the Russian Federation. 
14
(6) Although the Government of the United 
15
States is right to diplomatically press the Govern-
16
ment of the Russian Federation to return to full 
17
compliance with its obligations under the Treaty on 
18
Open Skies, withdrawal or termination of the treaty 
19
would deprive United States allies and partners of 
20
the benefits derived from observation missions over 
21
Russian territory and Russian occupied Eastern 
22
Ukraine, missions that have vastly outnumbered 
23
Russian overflights of United States territory since 
24
entry into force of the treaty.

(7) The Mutual Defense Treaty Between the 
1
United States and the Republic of Korea, signed at 
2
Washington October 1, 1953, the ratification of 
3
which the Senate advised and consented to on Janu-
4
ary 26, 1954, was born from mutual sacrifice during 
5
the Korean War, is based on shared values and in-
6
terests, and remains critical to the national security 
7
of the United States nearly 7 decades after its sign-
8
ing. 
9
(8) A February 2020 report from the Depart-
10
ment of State confirmed, in part, that verifiable lim-
11
its on ‘‘Russia’s strategic nuclear force’’ under the 
12
New START Treaty ‘‘currently contribute to the na-
13
tional security of the United States’’. 
14
(9) A decision by the President to allow the 
15
New START Treaty to expire on February 5, 2021, 
16
without the United States having first successfully 
17
concluded a verifiable and binding agreement in its 
18
place, would lead to the United States losing visi-
19
bility into the location, movement, and disposition of 
20
the strategic arsenal of the Russian Federation to 
21
the detriment of the national security of the United 
22
States and its allies.

(10) The Constitution of the United States pro-
24
vides Congress an important role in the treaty proc-

ess, requiring the advice and consent of two-thirds

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
4
It is the sense of Congress that— 
5
(1) the President should refrain from taking 
6
any action to withdraw or terminate any inter-
7
national treaty to which the Senate has given its ad-
8
vice and consent to ratification without proper con-
9
sultation with, and affirmative approval from, Con-
10
gress; 
11
(2) the 1979 Supreme Court decision in Gold-
12
water v. Carter, 444 U.S. 996 (1979), is not control-
13
ling legal precedent with respect to the role of Con-
14
gress in the withdrawal or termination of the United 
15
States from an international treaty, as the Court di-
16
rected the lower court to dismiss the complaint and 
17
did not address the constitutionality of the decision 
18
by President Carter to terminate the Mutual De-
19
fense Treaty between the United States of America 
20
and the Republic of China, signed at Washington 
21
December 2, 1954 (commonly referred to as the 
22
‘‘Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty’’); and 
23
(3) the United States should take every action 
24
to reinforce its global reputation as a country that 
25

fully complies with its obligations under the inter-

INTERNATIONAL TREATY. 
5
No action to terminate or withdraw the United States 
6
from any international treaty to which the Senate has 
7
given its advice and consent to ratification may occur un-
8
less— 
9
(1) the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary 
10
of State meet the requirements under section 5; and 
11
(2) there is enacted into law a joint resolution 
12
that approves such action.
