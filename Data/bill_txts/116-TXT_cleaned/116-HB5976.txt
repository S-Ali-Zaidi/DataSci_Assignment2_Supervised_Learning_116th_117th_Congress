A BILL 
To direct the Secretary of Education to carry out a STEM 
grant program. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Partnerships for 
4
Progress and Prosperity Act’’ or the ‘‘P3 Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) As part of their Blueprint for Action re-
8
searchers at Harvard Graduate School of Education 
9
and the Pathways to Prosperity Network recommend 
10
creating programs designed to ‘‘combine work and

academic learning in post-secondary career prepara-
1
tion’’. In a follow-up study to the original ‘‘Path-
2
ways to Prosperity’’ published by Harvard’s Grad-
3
uate School of Education in 2011, the same re-
4
searchers released ‘‘A Blueprint for Action’’ in June 
5
2014. 
6
(2) The Executive Office of Science and Tech-
7
nology Policy have explicitly stated a goal of 
8
strengthening America’s STEM workforce. 
9
(3) According to a study by the Manufacturing 
10
Institute, a national survey of United States manu-
11
facturing executives found that 83 percent of Amer-
12
ican manufacturers reported a moderate or severe 
13
shortage of skilled workers. 
14
(4) The American Enterprise Institute further 
15
states that, ‘‘According to the U.S. Department of 
16
Labor, the percentage of manufacturing workers 
17
aged 55 to 64 and the share of workers older than 
18
65 have both significantly increased since 2000. 
19
Moreover, they also report that the median age of 
20
the manufacturing workforce increased from 40.5 in 
21
2000 to 44.1 in 2011. The Society of Manufacturing 
22
Engineers predicts that the shortfall of skilled fac-
23
tory workers could increase to 3 million jobs by 
24
2015 due to the aging manufacturing workforce and 
25

the resulting retirements of older workers, at the 
1
same time that an anticipated manufacturing re-
2
bound will increase demand for skilled workers.’’. 
3
(5) The 2012 Program for International Stu-
4
dent Assessment found the United States below the 
5
average score of participating countries in mathe-
6
matics and science. Furthermore, the United States 
7
has dropped in the rankings for mathematics 
8
achievement from 25th in 2009 to 36th in 2012. 
9
(6) NAE, along with other peer-reviewed publi-
10
cations and studies from universities around the 
11
country have examined the benefits of partnerships 
12
between schools and outside organizations. Partner-
13
ships for Progress and Prosperity Act programs as 
14
well as experiential learning play an important role 
15
in training students for the jobs of the future.
