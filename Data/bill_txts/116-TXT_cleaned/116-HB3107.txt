SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
1
It is the sense of Congress that— 
2
(1) use of prior authorization should be stream-
3
lined through electronic transmissions for coverage 
4
of covered services for individuals enrolled in feder-
5
ally funded programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, 
6
and federally contracted managed care plans to im-
7
prove patient access to medically appropriate serv-
8
ices and reduce administrative burden through auto-
9
mation informed by clinical decision support; 
10
(2) there should be increased transparency for 
11
beneficiaries and providers and increased oversight 
12
by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services on 
13
the processes used for prior authorization; and 
14
(3) prior authorization is a tool that can be 
15
used to responsibly prevent unnecessary care and 
16
promote safe and evidence-based care.
