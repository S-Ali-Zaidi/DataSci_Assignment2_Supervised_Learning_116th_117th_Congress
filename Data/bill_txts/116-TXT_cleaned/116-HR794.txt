RESOLUTION 
Supporting the designation of January 2020 as ‘‘National 
One Health Awareness Month’’ to promote awareness 
of organizations focused on public health, animal health, 
and environmental health collaboration throughout the 
United States and to recognize the critical contributions 
of those organizations to the future of the United States. 
Whereas One Health is a collaborative, multisectoral, and 
transdisciplinary approach, working at the local, regional, 
national, and global levels, with the goal of achieving op-
timal health outcomes recognizing the interconnection be-
tween people, animals, plants, and their shared environ-
ment;

Whereas the mission of One Health is to establish closer pro-
fessional interactions, collaborations, and educational op-
portunities across the various medical, veterinary, and 
environmental health professions and their allied science 
professions to simultaneously improve public health, ani-
mal health, and environmental health; 
Whereas the increasing threats posed by emerging diseases 
shared between animals and people, foodborne, vector- 
borne, and waterborne diseases, and changes to the envi-
ronment make the necessity of One Health clear and de-
mand an integrated effort by professionals from multiple 
disciplines, including health, science, technology, and en-
gineering; 
Whereas according to the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, up to 75 percent of new or emerging infec-
tious diseases in people are spread by animals; 
Whereas, each year, International One Health Day is Novem-
ber 3; and 
Whereas One Health is essential to combating and strength-
ening the surveillance of emerging and reemerging dis-
eases: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives supports

the designation of ‘‘National One Health Awareness

Month’’—

(1) to promote awareness of organizations that
