A BILL 
To promote digital citizenship and media literacy. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Digital Citizenship and 
4
Media Literacy Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) People in the United States rely on infor-
8
mation from mass media, social media, and digital 
9
media to make decisions about all aspects of social, 
10
economic, and political life, including products and 
11

services consumption, employment, career and pro-
1
fessional development, family and leisure choices, 
2
health and wellness, and democratic engagement. 
3
Ensuring that people in the United States possess 
4
the skills to make these informed decisions based on 
5
media begins early in life. 
6
(2) Adversaries from Russia, China, and Iran 
7
are using information warfare to influence democ-
8
racies across the world, and terrorist organizations 
9
often use digital communications to recruit mem-
10
bers. The United States can fight these influences 
11
by ensuring that citizens of the United States pos-
12
sess the necessary skills to discern disinformation 
13
and misinformation and think critically about their 
14
digital activities. 
15
(3) Influence campaigns by foreign and domes-
16
tic groups reached tens of millions of voters during 
17
the 2016 and 2018 elections with racially and divi-
18
sively targeted messages. The preservation of elec-
19
tions free of foreign influence is of utmost impor-
20
tance, and therefore Congress must take steps to 
21
counter influence campaigns with media literacy. 
22
(4) Media literacy education is critical to allow 
23
young people to make informed decisions about 
24
products and services, education, health and well-
25

ness, and democratic decisions associated with public 
1
policy. Media literacy education must be inclusive 
2
and accessible for all students, including at-risk stu-
3
dents and students with disabilities. Media literacy 
4
empowers young people and gives them the agency 
5
to make informed decisions about their future, ad-
6
vertisements, the use of controlled substances, nutri-
7
tion, and physical health. Equipping students with 
8
the skills to make informed decisions in these areas 
9
contributes to the betterment of mental health and 
10
public health. 
11
(5) A successful and inclusive media literacy 
12
program must be directed at students beginning in 
13
kindergarten and should continue throughout the 
14
completion of postsecondary education. Learning to 
15
critically analyze and create media is a lifelong proc-
16
ess that can be developed by integrating media lit-
17
eracy competencies into academic curriculum across 
18
content areas and disciplines. 
19
(6) Media literacy also allows young people to 
20
develop the critical thinking skills that will help 
21
them become informed voters. The right to vote is 
22
a fundamental right afforded to United States citi-
23
zens by the Constitution. The unimpeded free exer-
24
cise of this right is essential to the functioning of 
25

our democracy. The process to protect our democ-
1
racy begins with educating young people in the 
2
United States to ensure that the young people pos-
3
sess the skills to engage in civic activities, engage 
4
with communities, and eventually become informed 
5
voters.
