RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the goal of United States foreign policy should 
be to promote human rights and equal rights for all. 
Whereas the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopt-
ed by the United Nations (UN) 71 years ago on Decem-
ber 10, 1948, represented the first comprehensive agree-
ment among nations as to the specific rights and free-
doms of all human beings; 
Whereas the Department of State has declared that a central 
goal of the United States foreign policy is the promotion

of respect for human rights, as embodied in the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights; 
Whereas the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is a 
‘‘common standard of achievement for all peoples and all 
nations, to the end that every individual and every organ 
of society, keeping this Declaration constantly in mind, 
shall strive by teaching and education to promote respect 
for these rights and freedoms and by progressive meas-
ures, national and international, to secure their universal 
and effective recognition and observance, both among the 
peoples of UN Member States themselves and among the 
peoples of territories under their jurisdiction.’’; 
Whereas it is in the national interest of the United States to 
impose consistent and principled human rights policies 
when engaging with both allies and competitors alike; 
Whereas according to the Human Rights Foundation, more 
than half of the world’s population live under nondemo-
cratic regimes, meaning that 3,700,000,000 people are 
controlled by absolute monarchs, military occupation or 
juntas, competitive authoritarians, or full-fledged dicta-
torships; 
Whereas human rights, equal rights, and justice are essential 
to the realization of fundamental freedoms and pro-
moting more equitable societies, preventing conflict and 
atrocities, and enhancing participation in the democratic 
process; 
Whereas the United States must build respect for and the 
protection of human rights, equal rights, and justice for 
all here at home in order to set a standard by which both 
allies and competitors can be held to account; and

Whereas particularly in the face of rising global authoritari-
anism, the executive and legislative branches of the

around the globe: Now, therefore, be it
