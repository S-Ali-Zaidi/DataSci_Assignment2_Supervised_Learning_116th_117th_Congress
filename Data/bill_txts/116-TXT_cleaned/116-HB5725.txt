SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress makes the following findings: 
2
(1) In February 2019, the Government of Hong 
3
Kong proposed the ‘‘Fugitive Offenders and Mutual 
4
Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation 
5
(Amendment) Bill 2019’’ (in this section referred to 
6
as the ‘‘extradition bill’’). 
7
(2) The extradition bill would have allowed for 
8
the extradition of individuals from Hong Kong to 
9
the mainland of the People’s Republic of China for 
10
the first time and offered minimal if any legal re-
11
course to those individuals identified for extradition. 
12
(3) The extradition bill was but the latest ex-
13
ample of the steady encroachment of the Govern-
14
ment of the People’s Republic of China on the free-
15
doms guaranteed to the people of Hong Kong under 
16
the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law. 
17
(4) Millions of the people of Hong Kong have 
18
taken to the streets in peaceful protests since the in-
19
troduction of the extradition bill in order to defend 
20
Hong Kong’s democracy against predations by the 
21
Government of the People’s Republic of China, as 
22
enabled by Government of Hong Kong. 
23
(5) The Government of Hong Kong has re-
24
sponded to those peaceful protests with force and 
25
brutality, including by authorizing the use by the po-
26
02:13 Jan 31, 2020

5 
•HR 5725 IH
lice of tear gas, water cannons, rubber bullets, and 
1
beatings, resulting in the arrests and injuries of 
2
thousands of people. 
3
(6) On October 1, 2019, the Hong Kong police 
4
fired live ammunition at a teenage protestor, mark-
5
ing a dangerous escalation in the Hong Kong police 
6
force’s use of force against protestors. 
7
(7) The Government of Hong Kong has invoked 
8
the Emergency Regulations Ordinance in order to 
9
expand the powers available to Hong Kong’s police 
10
as they suppress protesters. 
11
(8) The Government of Hong Kong has coopted 
12
or coerced local companies like MTR Corporation 
13
Limited and Cathay Pacific Airways Limited into fa-
14
cilitating the suppression of protests by denying 
15
protestors’ access to reliable train services and ter-
16
minating staff who support the pro-democracy move-
17
ment. 
18
(9) The Government of Hong Kong continues 
19
to defy peaceful protestors’ rightful demands for the 
20
resignation of Chief Executive of Hong Kong Carrie 
21
Lam, an impartial inquiry into police brutality, and 
22
greater democratic freedoms, as guaranteed to the 
23
people of Hong Kong by the Government of the Peo-
24
ple’s Republic of China.

•HR 5725 IH
(10) The unwillingness of the Government of 
1
Hong Kong to meet protestors’ demands is a direct 
2
product of its role, not as a representative or pro-
3
tector of the people of Hong Kong, but rather as a 
4
proxy for the regime of the Communist Party of 
5
China in Beijing, which has demonstrated its intent 
6
to impose its will on Hong Kong, including through 
7
paramilitary or military force. 
8
(11) The approach of that regime to Hong 
9
Kong is not fundamentally dissimilar from the ap-
10
proach the regime has taken elsewhere in the Indo- 
11
Pacific region and beyond, including by using eco-
12
nomic threats to compel Air Canada, Air France, 
13
Apple, Audi, Blizzard Entertainment, British Air-
14
ways, Calvin Klein, Christian Dior, Coach, Dolce & 
15
Gabbana, Google, Malaysia Airlines, Marriott Ho-
16
tels, the National Basketball Association, Qantas 
17
Airlines, Swarovski, Tiffany & Co., and Versace into 
18
remaining silent in response to its treatment of 
19
protestors in Hong Kong. 
20
SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
21
It is the sense of Congress that— 
22
(1) the Government of the People’s Republic of 
23
China has willfully violated the terms of the Joint 
24
Declaration and the Basic Law; 
25
02:13 Jan 31, 2020
H5725
7 
•HR 5725 IH
(2) the steady encroachment of the Government 
1
of the People’s Republic of China on the freedoms 
2
and democracy of the people of Hong Kong reflects 
3
the fundamentally totalitarian nature of the regime 
4
of the Communist Party of China; and 
5
(3) the totalitarian ambitions of the Communist 
6
Party of China do not end in the territory of the 
7
mainland of the People’s Republic of China, but 
8
rather extend to the remainder of the Indo-Pacific 
9
region, as part of a broader hegemonic vision that 
10
would see the Government of the People’s Republic 
11
of China exert domineering influence over the inter-
12
ests and behavior of other countries in that region.
