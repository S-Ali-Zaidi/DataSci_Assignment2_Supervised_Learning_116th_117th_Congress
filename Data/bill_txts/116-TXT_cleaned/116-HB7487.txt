SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress makes the following findings: 
2
(1) The United States economy has changed 
3
rapidly as automation, artificial intelligence, digital 
4
technologies, and modern information and commu-
5
nication systems have transformed the way people in 
6
the United States work, live, and interact. 
7
(2) The United States must establish policies 
8
and create programs capable of responding to chang-
9
ing economic realities. 
10
(3) The United States must develop strategies 
11
to maximize current assets and help grow a United 
12
States economy and workforce that can thrive in a 
13
challenging environment of constant change and re-
14
invention.

•HR 7487 IH
(4) The Nation needs to strengthen and im-
1
prove Federal support for a Next Generation econ-
2
omy and workforce. 
3
(5) The United States must explore sustainable 
4
strategies to create jobs that will endure, will remain 
5
reliant on a local workforce, and are unlikely to 
6
move overseas. 
7
(6) There is great value and untapped potential 
8
in the Nation’s rich history, the creative freedoms 
9
enjoyed by its people, and the many cultures and 
10
traditions that make the United States so unique. 
11
(7) Promoting local arts and enhancing the cre-
12
ative economy of the United States would support 
13
the Nation’s diverse citizenry, rich traditions, and 
14
vast creative talents, including the unique history 
15
and continuing vitality of Native American commu-
16
nities. 
17
(8) The United States must embrace the oppor-
18
tunities and challenges the country faces and re-
19
imagine the role of the Federal Government in pro-
20
viding support for local arts and expanding the cre-
21
ative economy. 
22
(9) The United States needs to engage workers 
23
from around the Nation to develop, hone, and share 
24

•HR 7487 IH
expressions of their cultural heritage, including lan-
1
guages, creative collaborations, and artistic skills. 
2
(10) The Nation needs to recognize that there 
3
is a broad range of undervalued and underutilized 
4
human potential in the United States, and the exist-
5
ence of that human potential has profound social, 
6
economic, and workforce ramifications. 
7
(11) Securing the future well-being of individ-
8
uals, families, communities, and the Nation will de-
9
pend in part on adopting Federal policies that will 
10
increase support for the creative economy. 
11
(12) The Nation needs to improve creative 
12
workforce readiness and develop an education and 
13
job training plan, including a plan for education and 
14
training through specialized vocational schools and 
15
apprenticeship programs, to ensure that individuals 
16
of all ages in the United States can realize their full 
17
creative potential now and in the future. 
18
(13) Investing in a creative economy workforce 
19
would help showcase the Nation’s creative arts, 
20
strengthen its capacity for job growth, promote eco-
21
nomic inclusion, boost entrepreneurship, improve 
22
and revitalize rural, remote, and underserved areas, 
23
and empower communities to share their stories.
