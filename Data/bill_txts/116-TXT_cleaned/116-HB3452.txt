A BILL 
To amend part E of title IV of the Social Security Act 
to ensure that immigration status alone does not dis-
qualify a parent, legal guardian, or relative from being 
a placement for a foster child, to authorize discretion 
to a State, county, or other political subdivision of a 
State to delay filing for termination of parental rights 
in foster care cases in which an otherwise fit and willing 
parent or legal guardian has been deported or is involved 
in (including detention pursuant to) an immigration pro-
ceeding, unless certain conditions have been met, and 
for other purposes.
