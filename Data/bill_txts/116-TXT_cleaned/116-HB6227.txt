4
lected by the service may be used to identify

(b) PRIVACY SCORES.— 
16
(1) DEVELOPMENT.—The Commission shall use 
17
the privacy framework to develop a system for 
18
issuing a score for an interactive computer service 
19

20
the privacy of the covered information of users, tak-
21
ing into consideration the purpose of the service and 
22
options offered to users with respect to covered in-
23
