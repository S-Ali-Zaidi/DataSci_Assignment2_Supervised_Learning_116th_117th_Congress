This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Therapeutic Fraud 
2
Prevention Act of 2019’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress makes the following findings: 
5
(1) Being lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or 
6
gender nonconforming is not a disorder, disease, ill-
7
ness, deficiency, or shortcoming. 
8
(2) The national community of professionals in 
9
education, social work, health, mental health, and 
10
counseling has determined that there is no scientif-
11
ically valid evidence that supports the practice of at-
12
tempting to prevent a person from being lesbian, 
13
gay, bisexual, transgender, or gender nonconforming. 
14
(3) Such professionals have determined that 
15
there is no evidence that conversion therapy is effec-
16
tive or that an individual’s sexual orientation or gen-
17
der identity can be changed by conversion therapy. 
18
(4) Such professionals have also determined 
19
that the potential risks of conversion therapy are not 
20
only that it is ineffective, but also that it is substan-
21
tially dangerous to an individual’s mental and phys-
22
ical health, and has been shown to contribute to de-
23
pression, self-harm, low self-esteem, family rejection, 
24
and suicide.

(5) It is in the interest of the Nation to prevent 
1
lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and gender non-
2
conforming people and their families from being de-
3
frauded by persons seeking to profit by offering this 
4
harmful and wholly ineffective therapy.
