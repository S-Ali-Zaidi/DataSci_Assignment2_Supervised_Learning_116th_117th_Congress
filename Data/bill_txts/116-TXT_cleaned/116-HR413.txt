and bravery in an operation that helped bring an end 
to World War II. 
Whereas June 6, 2019, marks the 75th anniversary of the 
day the United States launched the assault at Normandy, 
France, alongside troops of the United Kingdom, Can-
ada, and Free France, known as ‘‘Operation Overlord’’; 
Whereas the D-Day landing was the largest single amphib-
ious assault in history; 
Whereas an attack by Nazi E-boats during a series of large- 
scale rehearsals conducted in preparation for D-Day, 
known as Exercise Tiger, resulted in at least 749 Amer-
ican servicemen deaths; 
Whereas soldiers of 6 divisions, including 3 from the United 
States, 2 from the United Kingdom with troops from 
Free France, and 1 from Canada, stormed ashore in 5 
main landing areas on beaches in Normandy, code-named 
‘‘Utah’’, ‘‘Omaha’’, ‘‘Gold’’, ‘‘Juno’’, and ‘‘Sword’’; 
Whereas approximately 10,000 Allied casualties were in-
curred on the first day of the landing, with more than 
6,000 being members of the United States Armed 
Forces; 
Whereas over the course of Operation Overlord, the Allies 
managed to land more than 2,000,000 men in Northern 
France and suffered nearly 230,000 casualties; 
Whereas military and civilians on the home front and abroad 
made significant contributions and sacrifices toward the 
success of Operation Overlord, including more than 
19,000 French civilian casualties during the Normandy 
campaign;

Whereas the Allied assault and following operations were sup-
ported by ships, aircraft, and troops from Australia, Bel-
gium, Czechoslovakia, Free Norway, Greece, the Nether-
lands, New Zealand, and the Polish Armed Forces in the 
West; 
Whereas the arrival of United States forces in Europe and 
the ultimate success of the Normandy campaign, albeit at 
tremendous cost, ultimately turned the tide for the Allies 
and led to victory over Adolf Hitler, the Nazi regime, and 
of one of the most evil ideologies the world has ever seen; 
Whereas the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial in 
Normandy, France, is the final resting place for more 
than 9,000 Americans who gave their lives to the cause 
of liberating Europe from Nazi tyranny; 
Whereas the advanced age of the last remaining veterans of 
World War II and the Normandy landings, and the grad-
ual disappearance of any living memory of the events, 
make it necessary to increase educational activities in-
tended to impart these critical moments in history, par-
ticularly to younger generations; 
Whereas the significant material remains of the Normandy 
landings found on the Normandy beaches and at the bot-
tom of the sea in the territorial waters of France, such 
as shipwrecks and various items of military equipment, 
bear witness to the remarkable and unique nature of the 
material resources used by the Allied forces to execute 
the Normandy landings; 
Whereas the 5 Normandy beaches and a number of sites on 
the Normandy coast, including Pointe du Hoc and var-
ious paratrooper drop zones, were the scene of the D-Day

and a symbol of peace and freedom; and

of the ‘‘Greatest Generation’’, who assumed the task of 
freeing the world from Nazi and Fascist regimes and re-
storing liberty in Europe: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
