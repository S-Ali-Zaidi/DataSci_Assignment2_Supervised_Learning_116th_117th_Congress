A BILL 
To take lands in Sonoma County, California, into trust as 
part of the reservation of the Lytton Rancheria of Cali-
fornia, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Lytton Rancheria 
4
Homelands Act of 2019’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) The Lytton Rancheria of California is a fed-
8
erally recognized Indian tribe that lost its homeland 
9
after its relationship to the United States was un-
10

justly and unlawfully terminated in 1958. The Tribe 
1
was restored to Federal recognition in 1991, but the 
2
conditions of its restoration have prevented it from 
3
regaining a homeland on its original lands. 
4
(2) Congress needs to take action to reverse 
5
historic injustices that befell the Tribe and that have 
6
prevented it from regaining a viable homeland for its 
7
people. 
8
(3) Prior to European contact there were as 
9
many as 350,000 Indians living in what is now the 
10
State of California. By the turn of the 19th century, 
11
that number had been reduced to approximately 
12
15,000 individuals, many of them homeless and liv-
13
ing in scattered bands and communities. 
14
(4) The Lytton Rancheria’s original homeland 
15
was purchased by the United States in 1926 pursu-
16
ant to congressional authority designed to remedy 
17
the unique tragedy that befell the Indians of Cali-
18
fornia and provide them with reservations called 
19
Rancherias to be held in trust by the United States. 
20
(5) After the Lytton Rancheria lands were pur-
21
chased by the United States, the Tribe settled on 
22
the land and sustained itself for several decades by 
23
farming and ranching.

(6) By the mid-1950s, Federal Indian policy 
1
had shifted back towards a policy of terminating the 
2
Federal relationship with Indian tribes. In 1958, 
3
Congress enacted the Rancheria Act of 1958 (72 
4
Stat. 619), which slated 41 Rancherias in California, 
5
including the Lytton Rancheria, for termination 
6
after certain conditions were met. 
7
(7) On August 1, 1961, the Federal Govern-
8
ment terminated its relationship with the Lytton 
9
Rancheria. This termination was illegal because the 
10
conditions for termination under the Rancheria Act 
11
had never been met. After termination was imple-
12
mented, the Tribe lost its lands and was left without 
13
any means of supporting itself. 
14
(8) In 1987, the Tribe joined three other tribes 
15
in a lawsuit against the United States challenging 
16
the illegal termination of their Rancherias. A Stipu-
17
lated Judgment in the case, Scotts Valley Band of 
18
Pomo Indians of the Sugar Bowl Rancheria v. 
19
United States, No. C–86–3660 (N.D.Cal. March 22, 
20
1991), restored the Lytton Rancheria to its status 
21
as a federally recognized Indian tribe. 
22
(9) The Stipulated Judgment provides that the 
23
Lytton Rancheria would have the ‘‘individual and 
24
collective status and rights’’ which it had prior to its 
25
00:29 Mar 08, 2019

termination and expressly contemplated the acquisi-
1
tion of trust lands for the Lytton Rancheria. 
2
(10) The Stipulated Judgment contains provi-
3
sions, included at the request of the local county 
4
governments and neighboring landowners, that pro-
5
hibit the Lytton Rancheria from exercising its full 
6
Federal rights on its original homeland in the Alex-
7
ander Valley. 
8
(11) In 2000, approximately 9.5 acres of land 
9
in San Pablo, California, was placed in trust status 
10
for the Lytton Rancheria for economic development 
11
purposes. 
12
(12) The Tribe has since acquired, from willing 
13
sellers at fair market value, property in Sonoma 
14
County near the Tribe’s historic Rancheria. This 
15
property, which the Tribe holds in fee status, is suit-
16
able for a new homeland for the Tribe. 
17
(13) On a portion of the land to be taken into 
18
trust, which portion totals approximately 124.12 
19
acres, the Tribe plans to build housing for its mem-
20
bers and governmental and community facilities. 
21
(14) A portion of the land to be taken into 
22
trust is being used for viniculture, and the Tribe in-
23
tends to develop more of the lands to be taken into 
24
trust for viniculture. The Tribe’s investment in the 
25
00:29 Mar 08, 2019

5 
•HR 1388 IH
ongoing viniculture operation has reinvigorated the 
1
vineyards, which are producing high-quality wines. 
2
The Tribe is operating its vineyards on a sustainable 
3
basis and is working toward certification of sustain-
4
ability. 
5
(15) No gaming shall be conducted on the lands 
6
to be taken into trust by this Act. 
7
(16) No gaming shall be conducted on any 
8
lands taken into trust on behalf of the Tribe in 
9
Sonoma County after the date of the enactment of 
10
this Act. 
11
(17) By directing that these lands be taken into 
12
trust, the United States will ensure that the Lytton 
13
Rancheria will finally have a permanently protected 
14
homeland on which the Tribe can once again live 
15
communally and plan for future generations. This 
16
action is necessary to fully restore the Tribe to the 
17
status it had before it was wrongfully terminated in 
18
1961. 
19
(18) The Tribe and County of Sonoma have en-
20
tered into a Memorandum of Agreement as amended 
21
in 2018 in which the County agrees to the lands in 
22
the County being taken into trust for the benefit of 
23
the Tribe in consideration for commitments made by 
24
the Tribe.
