(1) conditions inherent to traveling perform-
1
ances, including constant travel, temporary and col-
2
lapsible facilities, and the prolonged confinement 
3
and physical coercion of animals, subject exotic and 
4
wild animals to compromised welfare and chronic 
5
stress, and present public and worker health and 
6
safety risks not adequately addressed by current reg-
7
ulation; 
8
(2) current regulatory oversight of traveling 
9
performances is complex and costly, and these costs 
10
are not typically recouped via licensing fees, but are 
11
left to the American taxpayer; 
12
(3) the frequent mobility of traveling perform-
13
ances complicates oversight such that agencies and 
14
authorities cannot properly monitor, evaluate, or fol-
15
low through regarding the condition of animals or 
16
facilities, or their history of potential injuries, inci-
17
dents, illnesses, violations, or other issues, and so 
18
cannot properly protect animals, workers, or the 
19
public; 
20
(4) traveling exotic and wild animal perform-
21
ances use collapsible, temporary, mobile facilities, 
22
which risk escape and serious harm to animals, 
23
workers, and the public;

(5) traveling exotic and wild animal perform-

ances present safety risks by permitting or not pre-
2
venting public contact and by displaying animals in 
3
inappropriate, uncontrolled areas in dangerous prox-
4
imity to humans and other animals; 
5
(6) exotic and wild animals have intrinsic value; 
6
their wild instincts and needs are unpredictable and 
7
are not naturally suited to traveling performances, 
8
and they suffer as a result of being unable to fulfill 
9
instinctive natural behaviors; 
10
(7) exotic and wild animals used in traveling 
11
performances suffer severe and extended confine-
12
ment, and, deprived of natural movements and be-
13
haviors, are prone to chronic stress, behavioral, 
14
health, and psychological problems; 
15
(8) exotic and wild animals are forced to per-
16
form unnatural tricks requiring extreme physical co-
17
ercion, including, but not limited to the use of food 
18
and water restrictions, electric shock devices, bull-
19
hooks, metal bars, whips, shovels, and pitchforks, 
20
among other abuses; 
21
(9) it is not necessary to use exotic or wild ani-
22
mals in traveling performances to experience the cir-
23
cus or similar events;

(10) using exotic or wild animals as commod-
1
ities traded for traveling performances adds nothing 
2
to the understanding and conservation of such ani-
3
mals and the natural environment, and actually un-
4
dermines conservation efforts necessary to protect 
5
threatened and endangered species; 
6
(11) it is not possible to provide or ensure pub-
7
lic and worker safety or appropriate physical and 
8
mental welfare for exotic and wild animals under the 
9
traveling performance business model, which inher-
10
ently and significantly restricts animals’ natural 
11
movements and behaviors, and where abuse is preva-
12
lent and oversight problematic; 
13
(12) the use of exotic or wild animals in trav-
14
eling performances is or substantially affects inter-
15
state or foreign commerce, or the free flow thereof; 
16
it is essential to regulate such activities to assure 
17
animals’ humane care and treatment; and 
18
(13) restricting the use of exotic and wild ani-
19
mals in traveling performances is the most cost-ef-
20
fective and efficient way to safeguard animals, work-
21
ers, and the public.
