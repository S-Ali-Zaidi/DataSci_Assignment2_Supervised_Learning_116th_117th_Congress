RESOLUTION 
Condemning the genocide and other crimes against the 
Bosniak community perpetrated by Bosnian Serb forces 
at Srebrenica in Bosnia and Herzegovina in July 1995. 
Whereas, beginning in April 1992, aggression and ethnic 
cleansing perpetrated by Bosnian Serb forces supported 
by the military and paramilitary forces from Serbia while 
taking control in the surrounding territory resulted in a 
massive influx of Bosniaks seeking protection in 
Srebrenica and its environs, which the United Nations 
Security Council (UNSC) designated a ‘‘safe area’’ with-
in the Srebrenica enclave in Resolution 819 on April 16, 
1993, under the protection of the United Nations Protec-
tion Force (UNPROFOR);

Whereas the UNPROFOR presence in Srebrenica consisted 
of a Dutch peacekeeping battalion, with representatives 
of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, 
the International Committee of the Red Cross, and the 
humanitarian 
medical 
aid 
agency 
Medecins 
Sans 
Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) helping to provide 
humanitarian relief to the displaced population living in 
conditions of massive overcrowding, destitution, and dis-
ease; 
Whereas, early in 1995, an intensified blockade of the enclave 
by Bosnian Serb forces supported by the military and 
paramilitary forces from Serbia deprived the entire popu-
lation of humanitarian aid and outside communication 
and contact, and effectively reduced the ability of the 
Dutch peacekeeping battalion to respond effectively to a 
deteriorating situation; 
Whereas, beginning on July 6, 1995, Bosnian Serb forces at-
tacked UNPROFOR outposts, seized control of the iso-
lated enclave, held captured Dutch soldiers hostage and, 
after skirmishes with local defenders, took control of the 
town of Srebrenica on July 11, 1995; 
Whereas an estimated one-third of the population of 
Srebrenica at the time, including a relatively small num-
ber of soldiers, attempted to pass through the lines of 
Bosnian Serb forces to the relative safety of Bosnian 
Government-controlled territory, but many were killed by 
patrols and ambushes; 
Whereas the remaining population sought protection with the 
Dutch peacekeeping battalion at its headquarters in the 
village of Potocari north of Srebrenica, but many of these 
individuals were with seeming randomness seized by Bos-
nian Serb forces to be beaten, raped, or executed;

•HRES 1045 IH 
Whereas Bosnian Serb forces deported women, children, and 
the elderly in buses, but held over 8,000 primarily 
Bosniak men and boys at collection points in north-
eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina under their control, and 
then summarily executed the captives and buried them in 
mass graves; 
Whereas Bosnian Serb forces, hoping to conceal evidence of 
the Srebrenica massacre, subsequently moved corpses 
from initial mass grave sites to many secondary and ter-
tiary sites scattered throughout parts of northeastern 
Bosnia and Herzegovina under their control; 
Whereas the Srebrenica massacre was among the worst of 
many atrocities to occur in the conflict in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina from April 1992 to November 1995, during 
which the policies of aggression and ethnic cleansing pur-
sued by Bosnian Serb forces with the direct support of 
Slobodan Milosevic and the Yugoslav Government led to 
the displacement of more than 2,000,000 people, more 
than 100,000 killed, and tens of thousands raped, tor-
tured, and abused, including at concentration camps in 
the Prijedor area, with the innocent civilians of Sarajevo 
and other urban centers repeatedly subjected to trau-
matic shelling and sniper attacks; 
Whereas in addition to being the primary victims in 
Srebrenica, individuals with Bosniak heritage comprise 
the vast majority of the victims during the conflict in 
Bosnia and Herzegovina as a whole, especially among the 
civilian population; 
Whereas article 2 of the Convention on the Prevention and 
Punishment of the Crime of Genocide defines genocide as 
‘‘any of the following acts committed with intent to de-
stroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or

religious group, as such: (a) killing members of the 
group; (b) causing serious bodily or mental harm to 
members of the group; (c) deliberately inflicting on the 
group conditions of life calculated to bring about its 
physical destruction in whole or in part; (d) imposing 
measures intended to prevent births within the group; 
and (e) forcibly transferring children of the group to an-
other group’’; 
Whereas, on May 25, 1993, the UNSC adopted Resolution 
827 establishing the International Criminal Tribunal for 
the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), based in The Hague, the 
Netherlands, and charging the ICTY with responsibility 
for investigating and prosecuting individuals suspected of 
committing war crimes, genocide, crimes against human-
ity, and grave breaches of the 1949 Geneva Conventions 
on the territory of the former Yugoslavia since 1991; 
Whereas the ICTY, along with courts in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina and in Serbia, have indicted and convicted 
more than 1,000 individuals at the highest and additional 
levels of responsibility for grave breaches of the 1949 Ge-
neva Conventions, violations of the laws or customs of 
war, crimes against humanity, genocide, and complicity 
in genocide associated with the Srebrenica massacre; 
Whereas the ICTY found Radovan Karadzic guilty of geno-
cide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity and found 
Ratko Mladic guilty of war crimes and crimes against hu-
manity, and ultimately sentenced both to life in prison; 
Whereas both the ICTY and the International Court of Jus-
tice have ruled that the actions of Bosnian Serb forces 
in Srebrenica in July 1995 constitute genocide;

•HRES 1045 IH 
Whereas House Resolution 199, passed on June 27, 2005, 
and House Resolution 310, passed on July 8, 2015, ex-
pressed the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the aggression and ethnic cleansing committed by Bos-
nian Serb forces supported by military and paramilitary 
forces from Serbia in Bosnia and Herzegovina meets the 
terms defining genocide according to the 1949 Genocide 
Convention; 
Whereas the United Nations has acknowledged its failure to 
take actions and make decisions that could have deterred 
the assault on Srebrenica and prevented the subsequent 
genocide from occurring; 
Whereas some prominent Serbian and Bosnian Serb officials, 
including 
current 
Serb 
member 
of 
Bosnia 
and 
Herzegovina’s three-member presidency, Milorad Dodik, 
who has falsely labelled the Srebrenica genocide a ‘‘fab-
ricated myth’’ and ‘‘the greatest deception of the twen-
tieth century’’, have denied that the massacre at 
Srebrenica constituted a genocide or have sought to oth-
erwise trivialize the extent and importance of the geno-
cide; 
Whereas other prominent Serbian and Bosnian Serb officials 
have denied or refused to acknowledge that the 
Srebrenica massacre constituted a genocide, or have 
sought to trivialize the extent and importance of the mas-
sacre by disputing the number and identities of 
Srebrenica’s victims, claiming the existence of an inter-
national anti-Serb conspiracy, and disputing definitions 
under the UN Genocide Convention; 
Whereas many in the Republika Srpska, the Bosnian Serb 
entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and municipalities, in-
stitutions, and other authorities within it have honored

•HRES 1045 IH 
and glorified war criminals in an effort to rewrite the his-
tory of their offenses and instituted school curricula that 
teach students false narratives of Srebrenica or omit it; 
Whereas some nongovernmental organizations in Serbia dedi-
cated to human rights and justice have been instrumental 
in helping to document atrocities which occurred during 
the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as their 
perpetrators, and have worked tirelessly to encourage 
Serbian officials and the public to acknowledge the 
crimes committed by Serb forces during that conflict and 
to support the pursuit of justice regarding those crimes; 
Whereas the community of nations, including the United 
States, that intervened militarily to prevent further ag-
gression and ethnic cleansing as well as to advance nego-
tiation of the General Framework Agreement for Peace 
in Bosnia and Herzegovina (initialed in Dayton, Ohio, on 
November 21, 1995, and signed in Paris on December 
14, 1995) has continued to provide personnel and re-
sources to help ensure fullest implementation of the 
agreement, as well as to bring reconciliation among all of 
Bosnia and Herzegovina’s citizens; 
Whereas the Office of the High Representative of Bosnia and 
Herzegovina continues to operate through the multi-
nation Peace Implementation Council, but with dimin-
ished financial and personnel resources and, in its twice- 
yearly reports to the UNSC, repeated abstentions from 
exercise of its full executive powers; and 
Whereas the United States established the Atrocities Preven-
tion Board, an interagency committee that studied the 
lessons of Srebrenica and issued informed guidance on 
how to prevent similar incidents from recurring in the fu-
ture, and, in the Congress, passed the Elie Wiesel Geno-

United States Government reports to Congress its 
progress in such preventative measures: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) condemns the genocide perpetrated by Serb 
2
forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1992 to 
3
1995; 
4
(2) condemns statements, actions, and policies 
5
that deny or question that the massacre at 
6
Srebrenica constituted a genocide and that dishonor 
7
the victims or disrespect their families, and recog-
8
nizes that entire ethnic groups or communities are 
9
not responsible for the crimes committed by some 
10
members of their forces; 
11
(3) urges the Peace Implementation Council to 
12
restore full funding to the Office of the High Rep-
13
resentative of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and encour-
14
ages the High Representative to exercise his full ex-
15
ecutive powers to ensure that the General Frame-
16
work Agreement for Peace is implemented fully and 
17
to call for an end to historical revisionism, particu-
18
larly as it relates to the genocide at Srebrenica;

(4) encourages the United States to maintain 
20
and reaffirm its policy of supporting the sovereignty, 
21
legal continuity, unity, and territorial integrity of

2
(5) reaffirms its strong support for the people 
3
of Bosnia and Herzegovina and their aspirations for 
4
greater democracy, economic prosperity, and success 
5
in Euro-Atlantic and European Integration; 
6
(6) 
urges 
the 
people 
of 
Bosnia 
and 
7
Herzegovina, their elected representatives, and the 
8
international community to place renewed emphasis 
9
on respect for human rights and fundamental free-
10
doms held by the individual, which should not be 
11
compromised by any collective protections and privi-
12
leges to a group, ethnically based or otherwise; 
13
(7) encourages the United States to promote 
14
peace and stability in southeastern Europe as a 
15
whole, and the right of all people living in the re-
16
gion, regardless of national, racial, ethnic, or reli-
17
gious background, to return to their homes and 
18
enjoy the benefits of democratic institutions, the rule 
19
of law, and economic opportunity, as well as to know 
20
the fate of missing relatives and friends; 
21
(8) recognizes the assistance of the Inter-
22
national Commission for Missing Persons to Bosnia

missing after the Srebrenica massacre and approxi-
1
mately 75 percent of those reported missing during 
2
the whole of the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina; 
3
(9) welcomes the completion of the work of the 
4
International Criminal Tribunal for the former 
5
Yugoslavia, including its convictions and sentencing 
6
of Radovan Karadzic, Ratko Mladic, and 88 other 
7
persons convicted of offenses including war crimes, 
8
crimes against humanity, genocide, grave breaches 
9
of the 1949 Geneva Conventions, and related of-
10
fenses, a judicial process that has helped strengthen 
11
peace and encouraged reconciliation between the 
12
countries of the region and their citizens; 
13
(10) remains concerned that ethnic tensions 
14
stoked by political leaders and extreme nationalist 
15
sentiment can deter recovery and reconciliation in 
16
Bosnia and Herzegovina, and even encourage new 
17
violence with potentially deadly consequences; 
18
(11) urges all political leaders in Bosnia and 
19
Herzegovina to cease using divisive rhetoric to stoke 
20
ethnic divisions in order to achieve shortsighted po-
21
litical gains; 
22
(12) urges all political leaders to demonstrate 
23
courage by championing tolerance, empathy, and 
24
mutual respect for the purpose of fostering lasting

cuted at Srebrenica in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 
4
July 1995, along with all individuals who endured 
5
pain and suffering or who were killed in Bosnia and

Herzegovina from 1992 to 1995, as well as foreign

nationals, including United States citizens, and

those individuals in Serbia, Croatia, and Bosnia and

risked or lost their lives because of their defense of

human rights, fundamental freedoms, and ethnic

identity without discrimination.
