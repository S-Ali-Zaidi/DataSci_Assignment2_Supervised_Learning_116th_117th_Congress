SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The Russian Federation is constructing a 
3
gas pipeline from Russia to Germany, named the 
4
Nord Stream 2 pipeline, the completion of which 
5
could address potential increases in European en-
6
ergy consumption but also increase European de-
7
pendence on Russian energy and have destabilizing 
8
effects on the Government of Ukraine if Ukraine 
9
loses energy transit fees as a result of construction 
10
of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. 
11
(2) According to experts, the Nord Stream 2 
12
pipeline would transport 80 percent of Russia’s cur-
13
rent gas exports to Europe through one single pipe-
14
line system, which would run counter to the Euro-
15
pean Union energy policy of energy security and di-
16
versification of supply. 
17
(3) Section 257(a) of the Countering America’s 
18
Adversaries through Sanctions Act of 2017 (Public 
19
Law 115–44; 22 U.S.C. 9546(a)) states in part that 
20
it is the policy of the United States— 
21
(A) ‘‘to work with European Union mem-
22
ber states and European Union institutions to 
23
promote energy security through developing di-
24
versified and liberalized energy markets that 
25

•HR 1081 IH
provide diversified sources, suppliers, and 
1
routes’’; and 
2
(B) ‘‘to continue to oppose [the Nord 
3
Stream 2 pipeline] given its detrimental im-
4
pacts on the European Union’s energy security, 
5
gas market development in Central and Eastern 
6
Europe, and energy reforms in Ukraine’’. 
7
(4) On January 27, 2018, then-Secretary of 
8
State Rex Tillerson stated, ‘‘[T]he United States op-
9
poses the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. We see it as un-
10
dermining Europe’s overall energy security and sta-
11
bility. . .’’. Tillerson further stated that the pipeline 
12
would allow Putin to use energy as a ‘‘political tool’’. 
13
(5) On March 11, 2018, German chancellor An-
14
gela Merkel acknowledged ‘‘political’’ and ‘‘stra-
15
tegic’’ concerns regarding the Nord Stream 2 pipe-
16
line and stated that the pipeline ‘‘is not just an eco-
17
nomic project, but that, of course, political factors 
18
must also be taken into account’’. 
19
(6) Gazprom, a Russian energy company, is 
20
controlled by the Government of the Russian Fed-
21
eration, which, according to the European Commis-
22
sion’s Statement of Objections to Gazprom dated 
23
April 22, 2015, has undertaken efforts to use gas as 
24
a weapon of coercion.

(7) The Department of State, led by the Bu-
1
reau of Energy of Resources, has worked extensively 
2
with allies, including Denmark, to thwart such Rus-
3
sian efforts. 
4
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
5
It is the sense of Congress that the United States 
6
should— 
7
(1) continue to oppose construction of the Nord 
8
Stream 2 pipeline and other Russian Federation gas 
9
pipelines in northern Europe; and 
10
(2) take affirmative diplomatic steps to halt the 
11
construction of such pipelines.
