(a) DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM REQUIRED.—The 
5
Secretary of Defense shall establish a demonstration pro-
6
gram at a military installation in the United States, se-
7
lected as provided in subsection (c), to evaluate the feasi-
8
bility and benefits of employing innovative technologies, 
9
systems, and sensors to assist in the management of mili-
10
tary installations to enhance operations services, commu-
11
nications, safety, energy use, traffic management, air 
12
quality, and related operational and community services. 
13
(b) ELEMENTS
OF DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM.— 
14
Under the demonstration program, the Secretary shall 
15
evaluate innovative technologies, systems, and sensors— 
16
(1) to identify systems and service operations of 
17
a military installation that can be monitored and 
18
managed remotely using sensors or software; 
19
(2) to promote the quality and performance of 
20
operations at a military installation by improved sys-
21
tems and services performance to manage installa-
22
tion safety and security vehicles, improve installation 
23
traffic flows, and establish maintenance schedules 
24
that maximize the expected life of an item and elimi-
25
nate costly break-fix responses;

(3) to assist installation commanders and other 
1
installation managers in using technologies that are 
2
readily available to improve, enhance, and modernize 
3
methods and technologies to manage installations; 
4
and 
5
(4) to develop a framework and model plan to 
6
expand the use of innovative technologies to other 
7
military installations that results in readiness oper-
8
ational improvements and identifiable cost savings to 
9
the Department of Defense.

(c) MINIMUM CRITERIA FOR SELECTION OF MILI-
11
TARY INSTALLATION.—In an effort to determine the ca-
12
pacity and capability of using innovative technologies, sys-
13
tems, and sensors at military installations, the Secretary 
14
of Defense shall select as the site of the demonstration 
15
program a military installation that— 
16
(1) has a combined day-time, on-site population 
17
(including dependents and civilian personnel) of at 
18
least 65,000 persons; 
19
(2) provides both ground training and expedi-
20
tionary aviation training activities; and 
21
(3) is located within 75 miles of a military com-
22
mand headquarters focused on the use of advanced 
23
technology.
