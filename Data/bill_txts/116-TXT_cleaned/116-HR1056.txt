RESOLUTION 
Supporting the designation of a National Day of Civility. 
Whereas civility involves being nice or polite to others and 
treating others with respect; 
Whereas civil discourse and dialogue are hallmarks of the 
American political and social systems, and these hall-
marks have been jeopardized in recent years by growing 
division in and coarsening of our political culture; 
Whereas 9 out of 10 Americans agree incivility leads to in-
timidation, threats, harassment, discrimination, violence, 
and cyberbullying;

Whereas a majority of Americans believe incivility in our poli-
tics encourages general incivility in society and deters 
citizens from engaging in public service; 
Whereas racial and religious minorities, the homeless, people 
with disabilities, the poor, and law enforcement officers 
report having experienced the most incivility; 
Whereas civility training in schools, a national campaign to 
promote civility, a conscious public effort to practice civil-
ity, and a National Day of Civility may combat the 
threats posed by increasing incivility and distrust in our 
institutions; and 
Whereas July 12th would be an appropriate day to designate 
as a National Day of Civility: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) supports the designation of a National Day 
2
of Civility; 
3
(2) encourages a national campaign to promote 
4
civility in our schools, at work, and in our public 
5
spaces; and 
6
(3) calls on all Americans to practice civility.
