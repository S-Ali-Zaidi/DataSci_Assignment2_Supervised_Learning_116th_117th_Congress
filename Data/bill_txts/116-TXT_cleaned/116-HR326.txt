RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives regard-
ing United States efforts to resolve the Israeli-Pales-
tinian conflict through a negotiated two-state solution. 
Whereas the special relationship between the United States 
and Israel is rooted in shared national security interests 
and shared values of democracy, human rights, and the 
rule of law; 
Whereas the United States has worked for decades to 
strengthen Israel’s security through assistance and co-
operation on defense and intelligence matters in order to 
enhance the safety of United States and Israeli citizens; 
Whereas the United States remains unwavering in its com-
mitment to help Israel address the myriad challenges it 
faces, including threats from anti-Israel terrorist organi-

zations, regional instability, horrifying violence in neigh-
boring states, and hostile regimes that call for its de-
struction; 
Whereas the United States has long sought a just and stable 
future for Palestinians, and an end to the occupation, in-
cluding opposing settlement activity and moves toward 
unilateral annexation in Palestinian territory; 
Whereas for more than 20 years, Presidents of the United 
States from both political parties and Israeli Prime Min-
isters had supported reaching a two-state solution that 
establishes a Palestinian state coexisting side by side with 
Israel in peace and security; 
Whereas United States administrations from both political 
parties have put forward proposals to provide a frame-
work for negotiations toward a two-state solution, includ-
ing the parameters put forward by President Bill Clinton 
in December 2000, the Road Map proposed by President 
George W. Bush in April 2003, and the principles set 
forth by President Barack Obama and Secretary of State 
John Kerry in December 2016; 
Whereas ending the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is vital to the 
interests of both parties; and 
Whereas delays to a political solution to the conflict between 
Israelis and Palestinians pose a threat to the ability to 
maintain a Jewish and democratic state of Israel: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Rep-
