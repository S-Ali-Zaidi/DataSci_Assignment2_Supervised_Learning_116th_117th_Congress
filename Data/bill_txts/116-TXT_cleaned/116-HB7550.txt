SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) The American Civil War was fought be-
3
tween 1861 and 1865. 
4
(2) As early as 1864, efforts were underway to 
5
preserve places that had been the location of pivotal 
6
battles during the Civil War, even before surrender 
7
occurred. 
8
(3) The National Park Service preserves 
9
unimpaired the natural and cultural resources and 
10
values of the National Park System for the enjoy-
11
ment, education, and inspiration of this and future 
12
generations, including sites dedicated to the inter-
13
pretation of the American Civil War. 
14
(4) The National Park Service, the Department 
15
of Veterans Affairs, and the Department of Defense 
16
administer public lands that are responsible for Con-
17
federate commemorative works. Public lands play a 
18
vital role in capturing the historical and cultural sto-
19
ries that shape the Nation’s history, and the lands 
20
administered by the National Park Service, the De-
21
partment of Veterans Affairs, and the Department 
22
of Defense help facilitate the national narrative of 
23
the American Civil War. 
24
(5) There are 147 national cemeteries in the 
25
United States. Fourteen are maintained by the De-
26

partment of the Interior, through the National Park 
1
Service. The Department of Veterans Affairs, 
2
through the National Cemetery Administration, ad-
3
ministers 131 cemeteries. The Department of De-
4
fense, through the Army, administers 2 cemeteries. 
5
(6) The Department of Defense has jurisdiction 
6
over— 
7
(A) 10 major United States military instal-
8
lations named in honor of Confederate military 
9
leaders; and 
10
(B) Navy ships named after Confederate 
11
victories. 
12
(7) Given the significance these public lands 
13
and works play in our Nation’s education and reflec-
14
tion of the American Civil War, a full inventory and 
15
special resource study are necessary to locate Con-
16
federate commemorative works and help evaluate 
17
their suitability as resources for the interpretation of 
18
the American Civil War.
