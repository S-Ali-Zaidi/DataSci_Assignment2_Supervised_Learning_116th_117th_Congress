SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
The Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Reference product license or approval hold-
3
ers are restricting competitive access to reference 
4
products by sponsors seeking to develop drugs, ge-
5
neric drugs, and biosimilars under section 505(b)(2) 
6
or 505(j) of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 
7
U.S.C. 355(b)(2) and 355(j)) and under section 
8
351(k) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 
9
262(k)). These restrictions are deterring and delay-
10
ing development of drugs, generic drugs, and 
11
biosimilars by extending lawful patent-based monop-
12
olies beyond their lawful patent life. 
13
(2) The enforcement provisions set forth in sec-
14
tion 505–1(f)(8) of the Federal Food, Drug, and 
15
Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355–1(f)(8)) have not been 
16
sufficient to prevent anti-competitive practices that 
17
interfere with access to reference products which is 
18
necessary for the timely development of affordable 
19
drugs, generic drugs, and biosimilars. 
20
(3) There is not a regulatory structure in place 
21
that is sufficient to deter or remedy the anti-com-
22
petitive harm that results when— 
23
(A) access to reference products is re-
24
stricted to sponsors developing drugs, generic 
25
drugs, or biosimilars in accordance with section
