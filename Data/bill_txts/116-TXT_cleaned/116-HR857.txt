RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the 75th anniversary of the amphibious landing 
on the Japanese island of Iwo Jima during World War 
II and the raisings of the flag of the United States 
on Mount Suribachi. 
Whereas, following the surprise attack by Japanese forces on 
December 7, 1941, at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, the United 
States formally declared war on the Imperial Government 
of Japan on December 8, 1941; 
Whereas during the four years that followed the attack, the 
United States and allied forces fought a prolonged coun-

terattack against Japanese advances across the Pacific 
region; 
Whereas the tactic of attacking, defeating, and controlling 
Japanese-held outposts through the use of amphibious 
assault landings against Japanese-held islands and terri-
tories (referred to in this preamble as ‘‘island hopping’’) 
became crucial to successfully countering Japanese ad-
vances throughout the Pacific region; 
Whereas the goal of this island hopping was to secure air-
fields and supply bases— 
(1) in order to launch aerial bombardment attacks 
against the mainland of Japan using the new Boeing B– 
29 Superfortress; and 
(2) in preparation for, and in anticipation of, a 
United States invasion of Japan; 
Whereas, by early 1945, the United States and allied forces 
bravely fought and advanced to the island of Iwo Jima, 
an 8-square-mile volcanic island with 3 strategic airfields, 
located between the Mariana Islands and Japan; 
Whereas Iwo Jima was— 
(1) a strategic island with airfields to support bomb-
ers of the United States with fighter escorts; and 
(2) an essential base for emergency, refueling, and 
diversionary landings for B–29 bombers; 
Whereas, under the command of Japanese Lieutenant Gen-
eral Tadamichi Kuribayashi, Iwo Jima was a heavily for-
tified island with nearly 11 miles of underground and 
networked tunnels, rooms, bunkers, artillery emplace-
ments, ammunition dumps, and pillboxes supporting 
more than 21,000 Japanese soldiers;

Whereas, on February 19, 1945, under the leadership of 
United States Navy 5th Fleet Admiral Raymond A. 
Spruance and United States Marine Corps V Amphibious 
Corps Major General Harry Schmidt, with 3d Division 
Major General Graves B. Erskine, 4th Division Major 
General Clifton Cates, and 5th Division Major General 
Keller E. Rockey, the United States launched an amphib-
ious landing and assault on Iwo Jima that culminated 
with the engagement of more than 70,000 members of 
the United States Marine Corps, buttressed by thousands 
of members of the United States Navy and the United 
States Army serving as assault, garrison, and support 
forces (referred to in this preamble as the ‘‘Battle of Iwo 
Jima’’); 
Whereas the Marines who fought in the Battle of Iwo Jima 
overcame numerous disadvantages in the 36-day battle 
that included treacherous terrain, unfavorable weather 
conditions, and heavy enemy fire from an embedded, de-
termined, and fierce Japanese fighting force in places im-
mortalized by members of the United States Marine 
Corps, including the ‘‘Meat Grinder’’ and ‘‘Bloody 
Gorge’’; 
Whereas, on February 23, 1945, only 5 days into the Battle 
of Iwo Jima, members of the United States Marine Corps 
ascended the highest point on the island, Mount 
Suribachi, and raised the flag of the United States two 
separate times, and the second flag raising resulted in 
the iconic, Pulitzer Prize-winning image that— 
(1) was captured on film by photographer Joe 
Rosenthal; 
(2) has become a recognized symbol of determina-
tion, perseverance, and struggle; and

(3) has been memorialized as the United States Ma-
rine Corps War Memorial in Arlington, Virginia; 
Whereas the Battle of Iwo Jima, one of the bloodiest battles 
in the history of the Marine Corps, resulted in more than 
26,000 American casualties, including more than 6,800 
killed; 
Whereas most of the more than 20,000 estimated Japanese 
soldiers that fought in the Battle of Iwo Jima were killed, 
with only approximately 1,083 Japanese soldiers sur-
viving at the conclusion of the campaign; 
Whereas the Battle of Iwo Jima led to 22 members of the 
United States Marine Corps and 5 members of the 
United States Navy receiving the Medal of Honor, rep-
resenting— 
(1) the most Marines ever to receive the highest 
military decoration in the United States for a single bat-
tle; and 
(2) more than a quarter of all members of the 
United States Marine Corps to receive the decoration 
during World War II; 
Whereas the secured airfields on Iwo Jima became emergency 
landing locations for 2,400 B–29 Bombers, saving the 
lives of an estimated 24,000 flight crewmen; 
Whereas, 160 days after the end and victory of the pivotal 
Battle of Iwo Jima, the United States received the un-
conditional surrender of Japan on September 2, 1945; 
Whereas the world owes a debt of gratitude to the Marines 
who selflessly led the fight for the strategic island of Iwo 
Jima in the middle of the Pacific theater; and 
Whereas, on March 28, 2020, the 75th anniversary of the 
Battle of Iwo Jima will be marked by commemorative
