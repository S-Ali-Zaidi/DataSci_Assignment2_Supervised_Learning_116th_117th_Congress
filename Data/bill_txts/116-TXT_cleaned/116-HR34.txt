RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for designation of the first Saturday 
in October as ‘‘National Animal Rescue Day’’ to create 
awareness of the importance of adoption and to educate 
on the importance of spaying and neutering animals and 
the encouragement of animal adoptions throughout the 
United States. 
Whereas up to 6,000,000 cats and dogs are placed into shel-
ters every year and between 3,000,000 and 4,000,000 
cats and dogs are euthanized; 
Whereas there are between 3,000 to 4,000 animal shelters 
throughout the United States in need of medical supplies, 
blankets, towels, cleaning supplies, food, and educational 
materials about owning a pet;

Whereas increased knowledge and awareness of animal rescue 
programs throughout the United States will significantly 
reduce the number of cats and dogs euthanized and re-
duce the number of animals returned to a shelter who 
have been rescued; 
Whereas loving families welcome pets to their new ‘‘forever 
home’’ every day, but more adoption is needed; 
Whereas lowering the number of animals in need of rescue, 
by spaying and neutering, can help alleviate the over-
crowding of our Nation’s shelters; 
Whereas years of animal abandonment has left thousands of 
homeless pets in overpopulated shelters and rescues; 
Whereas a ‘‘National Animal Rescue Day’’ would encourage 
the rescue of animals like Winslow, a basset hound who 
spent his first 8 months of life starved and confined in 
a cage so small that his rear legs were unable to fully de-
velop and then was placed in multiple shelters before 
being adopted into a loving home; and 
Whereas the first Saturday in October would be an appro-
priate day to designate as ‘‘National Animal Rescue 
Day’’ to be celebrated through adoption events, festivals, 
and charitable giving which will increase revenues for 
shelters and pet adoptions: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives supports 
1
the designation of a ‘‘National Animal Rescue Day’’ to 
2
create awareness for animal rescue programs throughout 
3
the year and address the challenge of overpopulation 
4
through continued spaying and neutering.
