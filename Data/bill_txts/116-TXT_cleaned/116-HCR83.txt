Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate

concurring), 
2
SECTION 1. TERMINATION OF USE OF UNITED STATES 
3
ARMED FORCES TO ENGAGE IN HOSTILITIES 
4
IN OR AGAINST IRAN. 
5
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following find-
6
ings: 
7
(1) The Government of Iran is a leading state 
8
sponsor of terrorism and engages in a range of de-
9
stabilizing activities across the Middle East. Iranian 
10
General Qassem Soleimani was the lead architect of 
11
much of Iran’s destabilizing activities throughout the 
12
world. 
13
(2) The United States has an inherent right to 
14
self-defense against imminent armed attacks. The 
15
United States maintains the right to ensure the 
16
safety of diplomatic personnel serving abroad.

(3) In matters of imminent armed attacks, the 
1
executive branch should indicate to Congress why 
2
military action was necessary within a certain win-
3
dow of opportunity, the possible harm that missing 
4
the window would cause, and why the action was 
5
likely to prevent future disastrous attacks against 
6
the United States. 
7
(4) The United States has national interests in 
8
preserving its partnership with Iraq and other coun-
9
tries in the region, including by— 
10
(A) combating terrorists, including the Is-
11
lamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS); 
12
(B) preventing Iran from achieving a nu-
13
clear weapons capability; and 
14
(C) supporting the people of Iraq, Iran, 
15
and other countries throughout the Middle East 
16
who demand an end to government corruption 
17
and violations of basic human rights. 
18
(5) Over the past eight months, in response to 
19
rising tensions with Iran, the United States has in-
20
troduced over 15,000 additional forces into the Mid-
21
dle East. The killing of Iranian General Qassem 
22
Soleimani, as well as Iran’s ballistic missile attack 
23
on Iraqi bases, risks significant escalation in hos-
24
tilities between the United States and Iran.

•HCON 83 IH 
(6) When the United States uses military force, 
1
the American people and members of the United 
2
States Armed Forces deserve a credible explanation 
3
regarding such use of military force. 
4
(7) The War Powers Resolution (50 U.S.C. 
5
1541 et seq.) requires the President to consult with 
6
Congress ‘‘in every possible instance’’ before intro-
7
ducing United States Armed Forces into hostilities. 
8
(8) Congress has not authorized the President 
9
to use military force against Iran. 
10
(b) TERMINATION.—Pursuant to section 5(c) of the 
11
War Powers Resolution (50 U.S.C. 1544(c)), Congress 
12
hereby directs the President to terminate the use of 
13
United States Armed Forces to engage in hostilities in or 
14
against Iran or any part of its government or military, 
15
unless— 
16
(1) Congress has declared war or enacted spe-
17
cific statutory authorization for such use of the 
18
Armed Forces; or 
19
(2) such use of the Armed Forces is necessary 
20
and appropriate to defend against an imminent 
21
armed attack upon the United States, its territories 
22
or possessions, or its Armed Forces, consistent with 
23
the requirements of the War Powers Resolution.

branch set forth in the War Powers Resolution (50 
6

7
(3) to affect the provisions of an Act or joint

10
hostilities against Iran or any part of its government 
11
or military that is enacted after the date of the

and partners if authorized by Congress consistent

with the requirements of the War Powers Resolu-
17
tion; or
