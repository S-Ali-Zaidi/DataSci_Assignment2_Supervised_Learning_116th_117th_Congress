RESOLUTION 
Expressing support to designate the week of September 21 
through September 27, 2020, Rail Safety Week in the 
United States, and to support the goals and ideals of 
Rail Safety Week to reduce rail-related accidents, fatali-
ties, and injuries. 
Whereas the first Rail Safety Week was held from September 
24 through September 30, 2017, by the national edu-
cation safety nonprofit Operation Lifesaver, the Depart-
ment of Transportation, and other organizations; 
Whereas Rail Safety Week was launched to raise awareness 
about the need for increased education on how to be safe 
around highway-rail grade crossings and railroad tracks 
and to highlight efforts to further reduce collisions, inju-
ries, and fatalities;

Whereas the number of public crossings has decreased by 8 
percent, while the number of gates has increased by 26 
percent since 2005; 
Whereas over the course of 30 years, grade crossing fatalities 
have decreased by 57 percent; 
Whereas while grade crossing injuries are 11 percent higher, 
grade crossing fatalities are 21 percent higher, and grade 
crossing collisions are 15 percent higher, since 2009; 
Whereas preliminary Federal statistics show that more than 
2,216 highway-grade crossing crashes occurred across the 
United States in 2019, resulting in 299 persons killed 
and another 822 injured; 
Whereas highway-grade crossing crashes are more severe 
than highway collisions and are more likely to result in 
death and injury; 
Whereas an estimated 94 percent of collisions and 87 percent 
of fatalities result from risky driving behavior each year; 
Whereas many collisions between trains and motor vehicles or 
pedestrians could have been prevented by increased edu-
cation, engineering, and enforcement; 
Whereas Operation Lifesaver, the foremost public information 
and education program on rail safety, administers a pub-
lic education program about grade-crossing safety and 
trespassing prevention; 
Whereas during Rail Safety Week, from September 21 
through 27, and throughout the year, everyone is encour-
aged to take added caution as motorists or pedestrians 
approach tracks or trains; 
Whereas the United States, Canada, and Mexico will observe 
Rail Safety Week concurrently; and
