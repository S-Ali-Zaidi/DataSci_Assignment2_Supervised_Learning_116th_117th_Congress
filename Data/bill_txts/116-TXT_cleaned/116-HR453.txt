Whereas the United States has always been a Nation of im-

kept our workforce vibrant, our businesses on the cutting 
edge, and helped to build the greatest economic engine in 
the world; 
Whereas the entrepreneurial drive and spirit of the Nation is 
built on our diversity of origins; 
Whereas it is the American dream that first drew people to 
the United States and continues to drive business in the 
Nation; 
Whereas the success of the United States is a result of our 
many distinct experiences, not in spite of it; 
Whereas as a Nation of immigrants, we must remember the 
generations of pioneers that helped lay the railroads and 
build cities, develop new industries, and fuel innovation 
and the exchange of ideas;

businesses in the United States, and immigrants and 
their children start over 40 percent of Fortune 500 com-

nual revenue;

United States economy and contribute roughly $2 trillion, 
or about 10 percent of annual GDP;
