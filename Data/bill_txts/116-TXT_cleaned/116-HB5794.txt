SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Endometrial cancer is cancer of the lining 
3
of the uterus (or endometrium) and is the most com-
4
mon form of uterine cancer. 
5
(2) Endometrial cancer is the fourth most com-
6
mon cancer diagnosed in women, after breast, lung, 
7
and colon cancer. 
8
(3) Endometrial cancer mainly affects post-
9
menopausal women, with most women diagnosed be-
10
tween age 55 and 64. 
11
(4) Women with polycystic ovary syndrome 
12
(PCOS) and uterine leiomyoma have an increased 
13
risk of developing endometrial cancer. 
14
(5) Unlike most other types of cancer, the inci-
15
dence of endometrial cancer, particularly aggressive 
16
subtypes of such cancer, has been increasing in the 
17
United States among all women, particularly among 
18
African-American and Asian women, with a 2.5 an-
19
nual percent change for both groups. 
20
(6) In comparison to non-Hispanic White 
21
women, African-American women have significantly 
22
higher incidence rates of aggressive endometrial can-
23
cers.

•HR 5794 IH
(7) Such incidence rates for Hispanic and Asian 
1
women are equal to or lower than such incidence 
2
rates for non-Hispanic White women. 
3
(8) Although non-Hispanic White women are 
4
more likely to be diagnosed with endometrial cancer 
5
in comparison to African-American women, the rate 
6
of mortality is higher for African-American women. 
7
(9) Currently, the cause of such disparity is un-
8
known. Researchers have studied the disparity in re-
9
lation to the time between diagnosis and treatment 
10
of endometrial cancer, including socioeconomic fac-
11
tors.
