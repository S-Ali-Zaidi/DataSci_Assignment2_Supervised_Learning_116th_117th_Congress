Whereas this event harmed individuals of various faiths and 
backgrounds; 
Whereas acts of terrorism create tremendous pain and suf-
fering in local communities; 
Whereas terrorism disrupts the fabric of trust in society and 
should not be used as a means to solve problems, in 
South Asia or anywhere in the world;

Mehmood Qureshi admitted that the head of Jaish-e-Mo-
hammad, Masood Azhar, is in Pakistan;

as a global terrorist; 
Whereas efforts were taken to de-escalate tensions following 
the attack; 
Whereas India is the most populous democracy in the world; 
Whereas misinformation was rampant during the crisis and 
contributed to the rise in tensions; 
Whereas respect for religious, ethnic, and other minorities is 
a pillar of democracy and fosters peace and prosperity; 
Whereas India and the United States launched a strategic 
partnership in 2005 to deepen security ties; and 
Whereas India and the United States share many values as 
well as economic and security interests, including with re-
gards to counterterrorism: Now, therefore, be it
