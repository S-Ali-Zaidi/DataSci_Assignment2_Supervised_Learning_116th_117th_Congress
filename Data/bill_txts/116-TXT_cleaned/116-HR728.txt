RESOLUTION 
Condemning the decision of Federal Housing Finance Agency 
Director Mark A. Calabria to remove the borrower’s pre-
ferred language question and the housing counseling 
question from the Universal Residential Loan Applica-
tion. 
Whereas 8 percent of the United States population (25.1 mil-
lion) is considered limited-English proficient (LEP); 
Whereas the preferred language question was designed only 
to better understand the unique challenges that LEP per-
sons face throughout the home buying process; 
Whereas language barriers make it especially difficult to navi-
gate the complex process of purchasing a home;

Whereas over one-third of Asian Americans and Pacific Is-
landers (AAPI) are LEP individuals; 
Whereas Spanish speakers in the United States account for 
64 percent of the United States LEP population; 
Whereas LEP home buyers make up a growing share of the 
mortgage market; 
Whereas communities with larger LEP populations have 
lower home ownership rates; 
Whereas every American, regardless of their race, color, gen-
der, sexual orientation, religion, national origin, dis-
ability, LEP status, or gender identity should have a fair 
and equal opportunity to purchase a home in this coun-
try; 
Whereas the 2008 financial crisis caused countless borrowers 
to lose their homes because language barriers made it im-
possible to comprehend the terms of the loans some of 
them received; 
Whereas access to credit and home ownership is a struggle 
for far too many qualified home buyers who are new 
Americans or immigrants; 
Whereas AAPI and Hispanic home ownership continues to 
fall behind the national average due to a number of fac-
tors, including language barriers and misinformation 
about the home buying process; 
Whereas the Federal Housing Finance Agency should collect 
data on the preferred language of borrowers to better un-
derstand and address the growing needs of LEP home 
buyers; and 
Whereas a standardized question on the Universal Residential 
Loan Application (URLA) indicating the borrower’s pre-
