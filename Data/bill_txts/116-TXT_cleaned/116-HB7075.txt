A BILL 
To prohibit the President from deploying any strategic weap-
on, such as a nuclear bomb, for purposes of altering 
weather patterns or addressing climate change, and for 
other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
The Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) According to reports dated August 24, 
3
2019, President Trump suggested the use of nuclear 
4
weapons to disrupt hurricane paths. Specifically, the 
5
President stated, ‘‘I got it. I got it. Why don’t we 
6
nuke them? They start forming off the coast of Afri-
7
ca, as they’re moving across the Atlantic, we drop a 
8
bomb inside the eye of the hurricane and it disrupts 
9
it. Why can’t we do that?’’. 
10
(2) The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Ad-
11
ministration (NOAA), the United States Govern-
12
ment agency that monitors and researches weather 
13
patterns and changes, stated ‘‘During each hurri-
14
cane season, there always appear suggestions that 
15
one should simply use nuclear weapons to try and 
16
destroy the storms. Apart from the fact that this 
17
might not even alter the storm, this approach ne-
18
glects the problem that the released radioactive fall-
19
out would fairly quickly move with the tradewinds to 
20
affect land areas and cause devastating environ-
21
mental problems. Needless to say, this is not a good 
22
idea.’’. 
23
(3) Nuclear weapons are the most powerful 
24
weapons known to mankind. A nuclear blast radius 
25
carries exponentially damaging radioactive fallout, as

demonstrated by atmospheric tests conducted by the 
1
United States in the 1950s and 1960s in the Pacific 
2
and Nevada Test Range. 
3
(4) According to the Director of National Intel-
4
ligence and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 
5
climate change remains a critical national security 
6
threat. 
7
(5) Researchers found that if little is done to 
8
constrain greenhouse gas emissions, and the world 
9
warms by 3 oC to 4 oC this century, then hurricane 
10
rainfall could increase by a third, while wind speeds 
11
would be boosted by as much as 25 knots. 
12
(6) Stronger hurricanes are intensifying more 
13
rapidly than they were 30 years ago due to climate 
14
change, according to recent research. 
15
(7) Increasing numbers of hurricanes are a 
16
function of climate change and must be addressed 
17
through serious and long-term solutions that include 
18
scientific research and technological innovation. 
19
(8) There is cause for concern to public health, 
20
safety, and national security by the dangerous mis-
21
use of nuclear bombs to alter serious weather pat-
22
terns.

SEC. 3. PROHIBITION. 
1
The Federal Government (including the President 
2
and any Federal official, department, and agency) shall

for purposes of altering weather patterns or addressing

SEC. 4. SCIENTIFIC REPORT AND STRATEGIC PLAN TO AD-
7
DRESS CLIMATE CHANGE AND HURRICANES. 
8
(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 180 days after the 
9
date of enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter for 
10
5 years, the President, in coordination with the Adminis-
11
trators of the Environmental Protection Agency and the 
12
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, shall 
13
issue a report to Congress on ways to combat increasing 
14
hurricane activity due to warming oceans from climate 
15
change. 
16
(b) CONTENTS.—Each report submitted under sub-
17
section (a) shall— 
18
(1) specify the number, names, and dates of the 
19
hurricanes over the past 30 years; 
20
(2) with respect to such hurricanes, include sci-
21
entific evidence and research regarding— 
22
(A) fatalities and injuries; 
23
(B) local, State, and Federal costs per hur-
24
ricane; and

magnitude and intensity patterns; 
2
(3) additional analysis of observations and 
3
changes to human activity that cause climate change

would not address the systemic issues and challenges 
17
of hurricanes.
