11
days, and shall verify within 3 days any 
12
changes to such information that is provided to

6
mation. If the online marketplace becomes 
7
aware that a high-volume third-party seller has 
8
neither certified that the seller’s information is 
9
unchanged nor has not provided such changed 
10
information within 3 days of receiving such no-
11
tification, the online marketplace shall suspend

13

5
the following situations: 
6
(i) If the high-volume third-party sell-
7
er demonstrates to the online marketplace 
8
that the seller does not have a business ad-
9

10
dress, the online marketplace may direct 
11

12
close only the country and, if applicable, 
13
the State in which the high-volume third- 
14

13
volume third-party seller has made a false rep-
14
resentation to the online marketplace in order 
15
to justify the provision of a partial disclosure 
16
under subparagraph (A) or that a high-volume 
17
third-party seller who has requested and re-
18
ceived a provision for a partial disclosure under 
19
subparagraph (A) has not provided responsive 
20
answers within a reasonable timeframe to con-
21
sumer inquiries submitted to the seller by phone

24
require the full disclosure of the high-volume

that allows for electronic and telephonic reporting of 
8
suspicious marketplace activity to the online market-
9
place and a message encouraging individuals seeking 
10
goods for purchase to report suspicious activity to 
11
the online marketplace.

13
PARTY THAN SELLER.—In addition to the requirements 
14

18
product if different than the seller listed on the product 
19
listing page.
