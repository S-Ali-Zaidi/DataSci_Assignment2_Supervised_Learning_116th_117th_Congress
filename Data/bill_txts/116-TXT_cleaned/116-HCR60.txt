Service and Remembrance’’. 
Whereas, on September 11, 2001, the United States endured 
a violent terrorist attack leading to the tragic deaths and 
injuries of thousands of innocent United States citizens 
and other citizens from more than 90 different nations 
and territories; 
Whereas, in response to the attacks in New York City, Wash-
ington, DC, and Shanksville, Pennsylvania, firefighters,

ers immediately rose to service in the heroic attempt to 
save the lives of the people in danger; 
Whereas, in the immediate aftermath of the attacks, thou-
sands of recovery workers, including trades personnel, 
iron workers, equipment operators, and many others, 
joined with uniformed officers and military personnel to 
help search for and recover victims lost in the attacks; 
Whereas, in the days, weeks, and months following the at-
tacks, thousands of people in the United States and oth-
ers spontaneously volunteered to help support the rescue 
and recovery efforts, braving both physical and emotional 
hardship; 
Whereas many first responders, rescue and recovery workers, 
volunteers, and survivors of the attacks continue to suffer 
from serious medical illnesses and emotional distress re-
lated to the physical and mental trauma of the tragedy; 
Whereas hundreds of thousands of brave men and women 
continue to serve every day, having answered the call to 
duty as members of the Armed Forces, with some having 
given their lives or suffered injury to defend the security 
of the United States and prevent further terrorist at-
tacks; 
Whereas all people of the United States witnessed and en-
dured the tragedy of September 11, 2001, and, in the im-
mediate aftermath of the attacks, became unified under 
a remarkable spirit of service and compassion that in-
spired the people of the United States; 
Whereas, in the years immediately following the attacks of 
September 11, 2001, the Bureau of Labor Statistics doc-
umented a marked increase in volunteerism among the 
people of the United States;

Whereas, in 2009, Congress passed and President Barack 
Obama signed the bipartisan Serve America Act (Public 
Law 111–13; 123 Stat. 1460), which established, at the 
request of the 9/11 community, Federal recognition of 
September 11 as a ‘‘National Day of Service and Re-
membrance’’ and charged the Corporation for National 
and Community Service with leading this annual day of 
service; and 
Whereas, since Congress and the President provided for Fed-
eral recognition of September 11 as a ‘‘National Day of 
Service and Remembrance’’ (commonly referred to as ‘‘9/ 
11 Day’’), millions of people in the United States observe 
the anniversary by engaging in a wide range of service 
activities and private forms of prayer and remembrance: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate 
1
concurring), That Congress—

(1) recognizes, commends, and honors the self-

less dedication to fellow citizens displayed through 
4
the heroic actions of first responders and other citi-

zens 
in 
New 
York, 
Washington, 
DC, 
and

Shanksville, Pennsylvania; 
7
(2) calls upon the Members of the Senate and 
8
the House of Representatives and all people of the 
9
United States to observe September 11, 2019, as a 
10
‘‘National Day of Service and Remembrance’’, with 
11
appropriate and personal expressions of service and 
12
reflection, which can include performing good deeds,
