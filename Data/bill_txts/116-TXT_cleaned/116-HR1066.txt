RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the importance of independent living for individ-
uals with disabilities made possible by the Americans 
with Disabilities Act of 1990 and calling for further 
action to strengthen home and community living for indi-
viduals with disabilities. 
Whereas, in enacting the Americans with Disabilities Act of 
1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.), Congress recognized 
that ‘‘historically, society has tended to isolate and seg-
regate individuals with disabilities, and, despite some im-
provements, such forms of discrimination against individ-

uals with disabilities continue to be a serious and perva-
sive social problem’’; 
Whereas the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 recog-
nized the rights of individuals with disabilities to fully 
participate in their communities through independent liv-
ing, equitable opportunities, and economic self-suffi-
ciency; 
Whereas Congress intended that the integration mandate 
under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 would 
ensure that individuals who are eligible for institutional 
placement are able to exercise their rights to community- 
based long-term services and supports and be free of dis-
crimination in the form of institutionalization; 
Whereas, 30 years after the enactment of the Americans with 
Disabilities Act of 1990 and 21 years after the decision 
of the Supreme Court of the United States in Olmstead 
v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), many individuals with dis-
abilities continue to live in segregated institutional set-
tings because of a lack of support services, which violates 
their right to community living; 
Whereas the continued prevalence of segregated institutional 
settings has hindered the inclusion of individuals with 
disabilities in communities, schools, and workplaces, un-
dermining the promise of the Americans with Disabilities 
Act of 1990; 
Whereas people of color with disabilities experience dispropor-
tionately greater barriers to service and access; 
Whereas, 30 years after the enactment of the Americans with 
Disabilities Act of 1990, telecommunication, electronic, 
and information technologies continue to be developed

without the goal of full accessibility and inclusion for all 
people of the United States; and 
Whereas, 30 years after the enactment of the Americans with 
Disabilities Act of 1990, many businesses, public and pri-
vate organizations, transportation systems, and services 
are still not accessible to individuals with disabilities: 
Now, therefore, be it
