RESOLUTION 
Recognizing National School Breakfast Week from March 
2nd through March 6th, 2020, and expressing the sense 
of Congress that providing breakfast in schools through 
the National School Breakfast Program has a positive 
impact on classroom performance. 
Whereas National School Breakfast Program participants 
under the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 include public, pri-
vate, elementary, middle, and high schools, as well as 
rural, suburban, and urban schools; 
Whereas, on average per day in the 2018–2019 school year, 
12,400,000 students in the United States consumed free 
or reduced-price school breakfasts provided under the 
National School Breakfast Program established by sec-
tion 4 of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966;

Whereas over 6,000 schools that participate in the National 
School Lunch Program do not participate in the National 
School Breakfast Program; 
Whereas, in the 2018–2019 school year, 8 States failed to 
reach even half of the low-income students who partici-
pate in the National School Lunch Program with the Na-
tional School Breakfast Program; 
Whereas just over half of the low-income students who par-
ticipate in the National School Lunch Program also par-
ticipate in the National School Breakfast Program; 
Whereas making breakfast widely available through different 
venues or a combination thereof, such as breakfast after 
the bell programs, in the classroom, obtained as students 
exit their school bus, or outside the classroom, has been 
shown to increase participation in free or reduced-price 
breakfast programs and lessen the stigma regarding such 
participation, which often prevents eligible students from 
obtaining traditional breakfast in the cafeteria; 
Whereas providing free universal breakfast through the Com-
munity Eligibility Provision has been shown to signifi-
cantly increase National School Breakfast Program par-
ticipation rates and reduce administrative burden; 
Whereas States with high implementation of the Community 
Eligibility Provision have experienced high participation 
in the National School Breakfast Program; 
Whereas studies have shown that access to nutritious pro-
grams such as the National School Lunch Program and 
National School Breakfast Program help to create a 
strong learning environment for children and help to im-
prove children’s concentration in the classroom;

Whereas providing breakfast in the classroom has been shown 
in several instances to improve attentiveness and aca-
demic performance, while reducing tardiness and discipli-
nary referrals; 
Whereas students struggling with hunger experience a great-
er prevalence of behavioral, emotional, mental health, and 
academic problems; 
Whereas students who consume breakfast have been shown to 
perform better on mathematical tasks, vocabulary tests, 
demanding mental tasks, and in dealing with frustration; 
Whereas studies suggest that eating breakfast at school, 
which is closer to classroom and test-taking time, im-
proves student performance on standardized tests relative 
to students who skip breakfast or have breakfast at 
home; 
Whereas studies show that students who skip breakfast are 
more likely to have difficulty distinguishing among simi-
lar images, show increased errors, and have slower mem-
ory recall; 
Whereas children that experience hunger have been shown to 
be more likely to have lower math scores, face an in-
creased likelihood of repeating a grade, and receive more 
special education services; 
Whereas National School Breakfast Program participants 
have better nutrition status and intake of nutrients, such 
as calcium, fiber, protein, and vitamins A and C; and 
Whereas children who fail to eat breakfast are more likely to 
be overweight or obese than children who eat a daily 
healthy breakfast: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
