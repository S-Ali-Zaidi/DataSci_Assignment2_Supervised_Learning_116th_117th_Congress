has been asked by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), 
a Jewish nongovernmental organization that fights hate 
crimes, to explain why she invited Abbas Hamideh to at-
tend her swearing in events, who said in 2016, ‘‘Israel 
does not have a right to exist. The terrorist entity is ille-
gal and has no basis to exist other than a delusional 
ISIS-like ideology’’; 
Whereas Abbas Hamideh also stated in 2019, ‘‘I’m willing to 
go back to my country #Palestine if the Zionist terrorists 
go back to Poland. Deal? Let’s get that ball rolling

Whereas Omar Barghouti, founder of the BDS movement, 
said, ‘‘We are witnessing the rapid demise of Zionism, 
and nothing can be done to save it, for Zionism is intent 
on killing itself. I, for one, support euthanasia,’’ and also 
stated, ‘‘Many of the methods of collective and individual 
‘punishment’ meted out to Palestinian civilians at the 
hands of young, racist, often sadistic and ever impervious 
Israeli soldiers . . . are reminiscent of common Nazi prac-
tices against the Jews’’; 
Whereas, as a result of the BDS movement, Jewish students 
on college campuses across America have been exposed to 
rampant anti-Semitism, for example, at New York Uni-
versity, after the student government passed a resolution 
supporting BDS, the Bronfman Center for Jewish Life 
was temporarily closed in response to threatening Twitter 
posts by a student who expressed ‘‘a desire for Zionists 
to die’’;

of which the United States is a member, adopted a 
‘‘working definition’’ of anti-Semitism as ‘‘a certain per-
ception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred to-

anti-Semitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish 
individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish commu-
nity institutions and religious facilities’’; and
