RESOLUTION 
Affirming the validity of subpoenas duly issued and investiga-
tions undertaken by any standing or permanent select 
committee of the House of Representatives pursuant to 
authorities delegated by the Constitution and the Rules 
of the House of Representatives. 
Whereas Congress’ power to conduct oversight and investiga-
tions is firmly rooted in its legislative authority under Ar-
ticle I of the Constitution, which commits to the House 
of Representatives alone the authority to establish its 
rules governing the procedures and methods for the con-
duct of oversight and investigations, as well as to deter-
mine the powers that it delegates to its various commit-
tees;

Whereas those powers delegated to the committees include 
the power to conduct oversight into and to investigate, 
pursuant to the legitimate legislative purposes of the re-
spective committees, matters involving, referring, or re-
lated, directly or indirectly, to the persons, entities, and 
organizations specified in this resolution; 
Whereas committees of the House, pursuant to the authority 
delegated by clause 2(m) of rule XI and clause 11(d) of 
rule X of the Rules of the House of Representatives, have 
undertaken investigations and issued related subpoenas 
seeking personal, financial, banking, and tax information 
related to the President, his immediate family, and his 
business entities and organizations, among others; 
Whereas the validity of some of these investigations and sub-
poenas has been incorrectly challenged in Federal court 
on the grounds that the investigations and subpoenas 
were not authorized by the full House and lacked a 
‘‘clear statement’’ of intent to include the President, 
which the President’s personal attorneys have argued in 
Federal court is necessary before the committees may 
seek information related to the President; and 
Whereas while these arguments are plainly incorrect as a 
matter of law, it is nevertheless in the interest of the in-
stitution of the House of Representatives to avoid any 
doubt on this matter and to unequivocally reject these 
challenges presented in ongoing or future litigation: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives ratifies 
1
and affirms all current and future investigations, as well 
2
as all subpoenas previously issued or to be issued in the

future, by any standing or permanent select committee of
