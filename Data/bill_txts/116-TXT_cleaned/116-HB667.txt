The Secretary of the Army, at his cost, shall

9
quest of a permit applicant, landowner, or other

affected person with an identifiable and sub-
11
stantial legal interest in a property, to deter-
12
mine whether a water is a navigable water 
13
under clause (iv) of subparagraph (A). The re-
14
view process shall not exceed 60 days, begin-
15
ning on the date of receipt of a written request 
16
from the affected person. If no determination 
17
has been made within the 60-day review period, 
18
the water shall not be considered a navigable 
19
water. A determination that a water is not a 
20
navigable water, or a failure to provide a deter-
21
mination, shall be binding on both the Sec-
22
retary and the Administrator for as long as the 
23
person has an identifiable and substantial legal 
24
interest in the property. If a determination is

•HR 667 IH
made that a water is a navigable water, the de-
1
termination shall be binding for a period of no 
2
longer than 5 years. The affected person may 
3
obtain expedited judicial review not later than 
4
30 days after the date on which the determina-
5
tion is made in a district court of the United 
6
States, of appropriate jurisdiction and venue, 
7
which is located within the State of the affected 
8
person seeking the review.’’.
