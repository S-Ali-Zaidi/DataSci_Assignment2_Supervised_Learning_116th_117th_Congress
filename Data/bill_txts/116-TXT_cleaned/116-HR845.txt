mutual understanding by living, studying, and working in 
local communities throughout the United States; 
Whereas international education and exchange programs 
serve an effective and proven diplomatic function with 
countries key to foreign policy and national security pri-
orities, encouraging goodwill toward the United States; 
Whereas promoting the United States as a destination for 
international students and professionals, while also en-
couraging students and professionals to gain inter-
national experience abroad, are wise investments in our 
country’s economic competitiveness; 
Whereas it is imperative that students understand how to 
interact with their colleagues from around the world and 
operate in multicultural environments; 
Whereas it is important to diversify the pool of citizens par-
ticipating in international study and exchange experi-
ences; 
Whereas students and other young people are the world’s fu-
ture leaders and innovators; 
Whereas there are multitudes of privately organized and 
funded exchange programs, while many others are funded 
by the Government; 
Whereas international education and exchange programs exist 
at multiple levels—high school, college, graduate, educa-
tor, citizen, cultural, and sport programs;

ment of State and tuition data from the Department of 
Education; 
Whereas this analysis shows that international students 
studying at United States colleges and universities con-
tributed nearly $41 billion to the economy and supported 
458,290 jobs during the 2018–2019 academic year; 
Whereas their exchange experiences enable international visi-
tors to become informal ambassadors both for their home 
countries while they are in the United States and for the 
United States when they return home, sharing an appre-
ciation for common values, counteracting stereotypes, and 
enhancing respect for cultural differences; 
Whereas research indicates that the United States needs to 
encourage more students to graduate with expertise in 
foreign languages, cultures, and politics to fill the de-
mands of business, government, and universities; 
Whereas international education and exchange programs are 
a singularly effective way for American students to de-
velop foreign language capability and cultural awareness, 
skills that employers seek in order to remain globally 
competitive; and 
Whereas international education and exchange programs 
shape the views and opinions of participants, many of 
whom are, or will become, leaders in their communities, 
both in the United States and abroad: Now, therefore, be 
it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
