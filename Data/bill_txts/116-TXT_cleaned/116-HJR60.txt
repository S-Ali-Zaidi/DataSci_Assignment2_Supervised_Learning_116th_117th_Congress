memorialize the American story of human flight in the

Whereas Congress enacted the Act of July 29, 1958 (com-
monly known as the National Aeronautics and Space Act) 
(72 Stat. 426–438; 42 U.S.C. 2451 et seq.), to declare

the country in celebration of the Nation’s highest 
achievements, under the leadership and vision of Museum 
Director, NASA astronaut, and Apollo 11 Command 
Module Pilot Michael Collins; 
Whereas NASA continues to pursue space exploration on be-
half of the American people to increase humankind’s un-
derstanding of the heavens; and 
Whereas the National Air and Space Museum continues to 
memorialize the history of American discovery and inven-
tion, and seeks to educate and inspire new generations of 
innovators and explorers to ensure that our future 
achievements in space are fully empowered by the 
achievements of the past: Now, therefore, be it
