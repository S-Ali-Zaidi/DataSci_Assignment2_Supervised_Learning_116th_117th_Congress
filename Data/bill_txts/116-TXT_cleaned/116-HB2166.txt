Congress finds the following:

•HR 2166 IH
(1) In 2005, each of the 196 World Health Or-
1
ganization member states signed the International 
2
Health Regulations to improve the world’s ability to 
3
prevent, detect, and respond to public health events. 
4
(2) In December 2009, President Obama re-
5
leased the National Strategy for Countering Biologi-
6
cal Threats, which listed as one of seven objectives 
7
‘‘Promote global health security: Increase the avail-
8
ability of and access to knowledge and products of 
9
the life sciences that can help reduce the impact 
10
from outbreaks of infectious disease whether of nat-
11
ural, accidental, or deliberate origin’’. 
12
(3) In September 2011, the United States and 
13
the World Health Organization signed a memo-
14
randum of understanding to help developing coun-
15
tries strengthen their capabilities to meet the Inter-
16
national Health Regulations. 
17
(4) In February 2014, the United States and 
18
nearly 30 other nations launched the Global Health 
19
Security Agenda (GHSA) to address several high- 
20
priority, global infectious disease threats. The 
21
GHSA is a multi-faceted, multi-country initiative in-
22
tended to accelerate partner countries’ measurable 
23
capabilities to achieve specific targets to prevent, de-
24
tect, and respond to infectious disease threats,

whether naturally occurring, deliberate, or acci-

dental.

(5) 
The 
GHSA 
was 
funded 
with 
a 
3
$1,000,000,000, one-time, 5-year supplemental ap-
4
propriation that expires at the end of fiscal year 
5
2019. 
6
(6) As of 2014, approximately 67 percent of na-
7
tions have not fully implemented the International 
8
Health Regulations and built appropriate core ca-
9
pacities to detect, assess, report, and respond to 
10
public health emergencies. 
11
(7) In 2015, the United Nations adopted the 
12
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which in-
13
clude specific reference to the importance of global 
14
health security as part of SDG 3 ‘‘ensure healthy 
15
lives and promote well-being for all at all ages’’ as 
16
follows: ‘‘strengthen the capacity of all countries, in 
17
particular developing countries, for early warning, 
18
risk reduction and management of national and 
19
global health risks’’. 
20
(8) On November 4, 2016, President Obama 
21
signed Executive Order 13747, ‘‘Advancing the 
22
Global Health Security Agenda to Achieve a World 
23
Safe and Secure from Infectious Disease Threats’’.

(9) In October 2017 at the GHSA Ministerial 
1
Meeting in Uganda, the United States and more 
2
than 40 GHSA member countries supported the 
3
‘‘Kampala Declaration’’ to extend the GHSA for an 
4
additional 5 years to 2024. 
5
(10) In December 2017, President Trump re-
6
leased the National Security Strategy, which in-
7
cludes the priority action: ‘‘Detect and contain bio-
8
threats at their source: We will work with other 
9
countries to detect and mitigate outbreaks early to 
10
prevent the spread of disease. We will encourage 
11
other countries to invest in basic health care systems 
12
and to strengthen global health security across the 
13
intersection of human and animal health to prevent 
14
infectious disease outbreaks’’. 
15
(11) In February 2018, the Director of Na-
16
tional Intelligence, Daniel R. Coats, released the 
17
Worldwide Threat Assessment of the U.S. Intel-
18
ligence Community, which said ‘‘The increase in fre-
19
quency and diversity of reported disease outbreaks— 
20
such as dengue and Zika—probably will continue 
21
through 2018, including the potential for a severe 
22
global health emergency that could lead to major

economic and societal disruptions, strain govern-

calls on the United States for support’’.

(12) In the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 
3
2018 (Public Law 115–141), Congress provided 
4
$172,600,000 for global health security and required 
5
the President to submit a global health security 
6
strategy to Congress not later than 180 days after 
7
the date of the enactment of that Act. 
8
(13) In September 2018, President Trump re-
9
leased the National Biodefense Strategy, which in-
10
cludes objectives to ‘‘strengthen global health secu-
11
rity capacities to prevent local bioincidents from be-
12
coming epidemics’’, and ‘‘strengthen international 
13
preparedness to support international response and 
14
recovery capabilities’’. 
15
(14) In December 2018, President Trump re-
16
leased the National Strategy for Countering Weap-
17
ons of Mass Destruction Terrorism, which states 
18
that ‘‘Although securing dangerous biological agents, 
19
controlled chemical precursors, and nuclear and ra-
20
diological materials is principally the responsibility 
21
of the states that hold them, it is manifestly in the 
22
United States interest that these states have both 
23
the political will and the ability to discharge this re-
24
sponsibility. Consequently, we will work with partner
