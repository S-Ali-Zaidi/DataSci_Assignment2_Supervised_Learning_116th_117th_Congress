A BILL 
To allow the Administrator of the General Services Adminis-
tration to transfer certain surplus computers and tech-
nology equipment to nonprofit computer refurbishers for 
repair and distribution, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Computers for Vet-
4
erans and Students Act of 2020’’ or the ‘‘COVS Act’’.

Congress finds the following:

•HR 7566 IH
(1) Access to computers and computer tech-
1
nology is indispensable for success in the 21st cen-
2
tury. Millions of Americans do not regularly use a 
3
computer, and research shows that substantial dis-
4
parities remain in both internet use and the quality 
5
of access with the digital divide concentrated among 
6
older, less educated, less affluent populations, espe-
7
cially veterans, low-income students, and senior citi-
8
zens. 
9
(2) In 1996, the President issued Executive 
10
Order 12999 instructing the General Services Ad-
11
ministration (GSA) to allow schools and nonprofits 
12
the ability to receive Federal surplus computers for 
13
educational purposes. 
14
(3) GSA created the Computers for Learning 
15
Program, which distributes approximately 30,000 
16
computers and computer-related equipment annually 
17
to public schools and educational nonprofits for 
18
reuse. 
19
(4) In July 2017, the Inspector General for 
20
GSA issued a report on the lack of controls with the 
21
CFL website. The report noted multiple cases of 
22
theft or fraud pertaining to lack of vetting of edu-
23
cation nonprofits registering on the website. Al-
24
though GSA indicated that other Federal agencies 
25
23:59 Aug 05, 2020
H7566

•HR 7566 IH
had responsibility to vet nonprofits for eligibility, 
1
many agencies were not aware of this requirement. 
2
(5) Since the IG report was issued, GSA has 
3
implemented reforms to ensure that agencies are 
4
aware of their responsibility to determine that edu-
5
cational 
nonprofits 
are 
certified 
tax-exempt 
6
501(c)(3) organizations. However, there remains an 
7
issue with schools obtaining surplus computers that 
8
are not ready to use. In most cases, the schools do 
9
not have the resources to pay to refurbish the com-
10
puters, which results in computers being wasted. 
11
(6) Any Federal program that distributes re-
12
tired Federal computers to a public school, an edu-
13
cational nonprofit organization, or a nonprofit com-
14
puter refurbisher for repair and distribution, would 
15
benefit from a partnership with a nonprofit organi-
16
zation, whose mission includes bridging the digital 
17
divide.
