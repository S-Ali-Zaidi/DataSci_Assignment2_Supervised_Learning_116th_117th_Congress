(2) Greg began cycling at the age of 14, win-
1
ning an astonishing 11 straight races to begin his 
2
career. 
3
(3) Greg took home a full suite of medals at the 
4
1979 Junior World Championships, including gold, 
5
silver, and bronze, emerging victorious in the road 
6
race and placing in both team and track pursuit 
7
events. 
8
(4) At age 18, Greg became the youngest cyclist 
9
in the history of the sport to be selected for the 
10
United States Men’s Olympic team. 
11
(5) Greg emerged victorious in the 1980 Circuit 
12
de la Sarthe, becoming the first American in history 
13
and the youngest rider ever to win a major pro-am 
14
cycling event on the European continent. 
15
(6) At age 19, Greg signed his first professional 
16
contract. 
17
(7) In 1982, Greg made the first of several re-
18
markable recoveries, returning from a broken collar-
19
bone to win the silver medal at the world champion-
20
ships in Great Britain.

(8) The Tour de France, the world’s pre-
22

(9) The Tour de France takes place over 23 
1
days, covering an extraordinary 2,200 miles, winding 
2
through multiple mountain ranges, spanning mul-
3
tiple nations, and is viewed as comparable to run-
4
ning a marathon every day for three consecutive 
5
weeks. 
6
(10) Greg first competed in the Tour de France 
7
in 1984, finishing third, and finishing second the 
8
following year, in both years deputizing himself to 
9
his teammates, sacrificing a chance to win himself to 
10
boost his teammates toward victory. 
11
(11) Greg emerged victorious in the 1986 Tour 
12
de France, ascending the fabled Alpe D’Huez, de-
13
feating the field by more than three full minutes, be-
14
coming the first American and the first non-Euro-
15
pean to win cycling’s most prestigious race. 
16
(12) In 1987, while recovering from a broken 
17
wrist and collarbone, Greg was tragically shot during 
18
a turkey hunting accident, leaving him in intensive 
19
care, requiring the removal of over 40 shotgun pel-
20
lets from his abdomen, was deemed unlikely to ever 
21
ride a bicycle again, and likely survived only due to 
22
the abnormal strength of his cardiovascular system. 
23
(13) Greg mounted the greatest comeback in 
24
the history of American sports, taking home an as-

2

3
ning by eight seconds in the closest finish in the his-
4

8
de France.

10
healthy sport amongst athletes of all ages and com-
11
petition levels. 
12
(17) Greg and his wife, Kathy, are active in nu-
13
merous nonprofit causes, including healthy sport, as-
14
sisting victims of sexual abuse and various childhood 
15
illnesses. 
16
(18) Cycling offers young people a healthy, ac-
17
tive, outdoor hobby. 
18
(19) Greg completed his professional career 
19
having won two World Championships, three Tour 
20
de France championships, and twenty-two titles 
21
overall. 
22

23
fied the ‘‘breakaway’’ culture of American cycling in 
24
the 1970s and 80s, viewed universally as the epit-

ome of a young person on a bicycle, attempting to 
1
accomplish feats no other American had achieved. 
2

3
international sport, but has devoted his time and re-
4
