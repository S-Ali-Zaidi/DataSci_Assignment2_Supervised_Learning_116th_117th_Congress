lies: 
General Charles McGee, one of the last surviving 
Tuskegee Airmen, who served in World War II, the Ko-

Kayla Mueller, a humanitarian aid worker who was 
caring for suffering civilians in Syria when she was kid-
napped, tortured and enslaved by ISIS for over 500 days 
before being murdered by ISIS leader Abu Bakr al- 
Baghdadi; 
Army Staff Sergeant Christopher Hake, who was 
killed while serving his second tour of duty in Iraq by a 
roadside bomb supplied by Iranian terrorist leader Qasem 
Soleimani; and 
Sergeant First Class Townsend Williams, who is 
currently serving his fourth deployment in the Middle 
East and his wife Amy, who works full time for the Army 
and devotes hundreds of hours helping military families; 
Whereas immediately following the address, while still pre-
siding over the joint session, Speaker Pelosi ripped up an 
official copy of the President’s remarks, which contained 
the names and stories of these patriots who sacrificed so 
much for our country; and 
Whereas the conduct of Speaker Pelosi was a breach of deco-
rum and degraded the proceedings of the joint session, to 
the discredit of the House: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives dis-
1
approves of the behavior of Speaker Pelosi during the joint 
2
session of Congress held on February 4, 2020.
