SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress makes the following findings: 
2
(1) Aung San Suu Kyi and the National 
3
League for Democracy (NLD) pledged that they 
4
‘‘would not arrest anyone as political prisoners’’, but 
5
have failed to fulfill this promise since they took con-
6
trol of Burma’s Union Parliament and the Govern-
7
ment’s executive branch in April 2016. 
8
(2) As of March 1, 2019, there are 354 political 
9
prisoners in Burma, 43 of them serving sentences, 
10
86 awaiting trial inside prison, and 225 awaiting 
11
trial outside prison, according to the Assistance As-
12
sociation for Political Prisoners in Burma. 
13
(3) During its three years in power, the NLD 
14
Government has provided pardons for Burma’s polit-
15
ical prisoners on three occasions. State Counsellor 
16
Aung San Suu Kyi took steps to secure the release 
17
of nearly 235 political prisoners. On May 23, 2017, 
18
former President Htin Kyaw granted pardons to 259 
19
prisoners, including 89 political prisoners. On April 
20
17, 2018, current President Win Myint pardoned 
21
8,541 prisoners, including 36 political prisoners. 
22
(4) The Burmese security forces have used colo-
23
nial-era laws to arrest and charge political prisoners 
24
and prisoners of conscience. These laws include but 
25
are not limited to provisions of the Penal Code, the

•HR 2327 IH
Peaceful Assembly and Peaceful Procession Act, the 
1
1908 Unlawful Associations Act, the 2013 Tele-
2
communications Act, and the 1923 Official Secrets 
3
Act. 
4
(5) On January 5, 2015, then-President Thein 
5
Sein announced the reconstitution of the ‘‘Scruti-
6
nizing Committee into the Prisoners of Conscience 
7
Affairs Committee’’, which was to comprise 28 mem-
8
bers and which would ‘‘promptly [carry] out pris-
9
oners of conscience affairs at the grassroots level’’. 
10
However, the Committee never met and no informa-
11
tion has been made publicly available regarding its 
12
mandate, procedures, or activities. 
13
(6) On December 12, 2017, Reuters reporters 
14
Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were arrested and 
15
charged with violating the Official Secrets Act, con-
16
tinuing a trend of restricting media and free speech 
17
and attempting to thwart coverage of the events in 
18
Rakhine State. 
19
(7) On September 3, 2018, Wa Lone and Kyaw 
20
Soe Oo were convicted and sentenced to seven years 
21
in prison. Time Magazine included pictures of the 
22
two reporters on the cover of its ‘‘Person of the 
23
Year’’ issue on December 10, 2018, as two of the 
24
‘‘Guardians and the War on Truth’’.

(8) According to Burmese free speech organiza-
1
tion Athan, 44 journalists and 142 activists since 
2
2016 were charged with colonial-era laws used to sti-
3
fle dissent and restrict activist groups and have 
4
faced trial. 
5
(9) Since December 2018, three Kachin activ-
6
ists were sentenced to six months in prison in con-
7
nection with peaceful antiwar protests; a protester 
8
demonstrating against the Myitsone Dam (a con-
9
troversial Chinese-backed hydropower project) was 
10
charged for peaceful demonstrations, and police used 
11
excessive force to crack down on peaceful protesters 
12
in Kayah State, with some of the demonstrators 
13
charged under vaguely worded, repressive laws. 
14
(10) On August 18, 2017, Aung Ko Htwe was 
15
arrested because he gave a media interview in which 
16
he described his experience as a child soldier, includ-
17
ing how the military abducted and forcibly recruited 
18
him when he was 13 years old. He was charged 
19
under Section 505(b) of Burma’s Penal Code. He 
20
faces up to two-and-a-half years in jail from the date 
21
of his conviction. 
22
SEC. 3. CHILD SOLDIERS. 
23
It is the sense of Congress that former child soldier 
24
Aung Ko Htwe should be immediately and unconditionally 
25
21:57 Apr 23, 2019
H2327
5 
•HR 2327 IH
released, and that no one should be jailed for freely ex-
1
pressing him or herself or for speaking against the use 
2
of child soldiers. 
3
SEC. 4. PEACEFUL ASSEMBLY. 
4
It is the sense of Congress that Burma must imme-
5
diately drop defamation charges against the three Kachin 
6
activists, Lum Zawng, Nang Pu, and Zau Jet, who led 
7
a peaceful rally in Mytkyina, the capital of Kachin State 
8
in April 2018, and that the prosecution of Lum Zawng, 
9
Nang Pu, and Zau Jet is an attempt by the Burmese au-
10
thorities to intimidate, harass, and silence community 
11
leaders and human rights defenders who speak out about 
12
military abuses and the impact on civilian populations. 
13
SEC. 5. PRESS FREEDOM. 
14
It is the sense of Congress that Burma must imme-
15
diately and unconditionally release Wa Lone and Kyaw 
16
Soe Oo, and that the imprisonment of these two Reuters 
17
journalists for documenting and reporting the crimes 
18
under international law committed against the Rohingya 
19
people is a gross injustice. Congress holds that press free-
20
dom is a fundamental human right and should be upheld 
21
and protected in Burma and everywhere. 
22
SEC. 6. STATEMENT OF POLICY.

It is the policy of the United States that—
