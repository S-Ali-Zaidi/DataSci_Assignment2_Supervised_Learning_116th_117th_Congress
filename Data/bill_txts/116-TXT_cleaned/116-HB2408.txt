A BILL 
To amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to update 
and clarify the classification of and applicable payment 
methodology for complex rehabilitation technology items 
under the Medicare program, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Ensuring Access to

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) There is a small and specific population of 
3
Medicare beneficiaries who have significant disabil-
4
ities and medical conditions who require complex 
5
and individually configured medical equipment, 
6
items, and technologies. These items and tech-
7
nologies are referred to as complex rehabilitation 
8
technology (or ‘‘CRT’’) and include specialized 
9
wheelchairs, specialized seating and positioning, and 
10
other types of adaptive equipment and items that 
11
are uniquely configured and fitted to the specific in-
12
dividual. Individuals in this population often qualify 
13
for Medicare based on their disability (rather than 
14
their age) and have significant disabilities and med-
15
ical conditions that may include, but are not limited 
16
to, cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, multiple scle-
17
rosis, spinal cord injury, amyotrophic lateral scle-
18
rosis (ALS), traumatic brain injury, and spina 
19
bifida. This small population comprises less than 15 
20
percent of the Medicare beneficiaries who receive 
21
wheelchairs. 
22
(2) Current provisions addressing Medicare 
23
benefit categories and related definitions do not suf-
24
ficiently define certain complex rehabilitation tech-
25
nology items and do not adequately describe and dis-
26
21:29 May 02, 2019
H2408
3 
•HR 2408 IH
tinguish these items as compared to other types of 
1
Medicare-covered medical items and equipment. 
2
(3) This current lack of definitional clarity for 
3
complex rehabilitation technology items results in ac-
4
cess challenges for beneficiaries with significant dis-
5
abilities and medical conditions, as these items are 
6
often grouped with standardized, nonspecialized 
7
products that significantly differ with respect to the 
8
complexity and the individualized configuration in-
9
volved, as well as certain evaluation requirements, 
10
clinical coverage criteria, and other considerations. 
11
(4) To provide adequate access for the small 
12
population of Medicare beneficiaries with significant 
13
disabilities and medical conditions who require these 
14
complex, specialized, and individually configured 
15
items a distinct Medicare benefit category for com-
16
plex rehabilitative technology items is needed. This 
17
will allow for related improvements to clarify appli-
18
cable coding, coverage, payment, and supplier stand-
19
ards for such items. A separate benefit category is 
20
needed to ensure appropriate access to these items 
21
for individuals with significant disabilities and med-
22
ical conditions, and will help prevent potential over-
23
utilization of CRT by individuals for whom such 
24
items are not medically necessary.
