A BILL 
To provide financial lending mechanisms to assist North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization allies in modernizing their 
military forces, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘NATO Defense Fi-
4
nancing Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Many United States allies, including some

North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) mem-

bers, continue to operate Soviet era military equip-
1
ment. This equipment is outdated, unreliable, in-
2
creasingly unsafe and is unable to effectively inte-
3
grate and operate jointly with United States military 
4
forces. 
5
(2) The inability of some NATO allies to fully 
6
operate alongside United States military forces de-
7
creases NATO combat effectiveness and places addi-
8
tional strain on the United States military. 
9
(3) Some NATO allies are compelled to buy 
10
spare parts and services from Russian providers to 
11
keep their Soviet-designed equipment functional. 
12
These NATO allies desire to operate modern West-
13
ern military equipment, but have limited financial 
14
resources available to purchase expensive new equip-
15
ment. 
16
(4) Following the end of World War II, the 
17
United States faced a need to help allies rebuild 
18
their militaries, which it addressed by providing sub-
19
stantial financial assistance through the Mutual De-
20
fense Assistance Act of 1949 (22 U.S.C. 1571 et 
21
seq.) and the Mutual Security Act of 1951 (Public 
22
Law 82–165; 65 Stat. 373). However, the United 
23
States has not provided similar assistance to new 
24
NATO allies following the end of the Cold War.

•HR 3194 IH
(5) Given the return of ‘‘great power competi-
1
tion’’ and an aggressive Russia, there is a pressing 
2
need to assist NATO allies to modernize their forces 
3
and replace their obsolete Soviet military equipment. 
4
(6) The United States does provide some mili-
5
tary equipment to NATO allies through the foreign 
6
military financing program and other grant assist-
7
ance, but that assistance is insufficient to meet al-
8
lies’ needs. 
9
(7) To supplement existing grant assistance, 
10
providing foreign military financing loans to allies— 
11
at rates competitive with those already available on 
12
commercial markets—to purchase NATO interoper-
13
able military equipment supports allies’ moderniza-
14
tion requirements. 
15
(8) As described in Article 2 of the North At-
16
lantic Treaty, in addition to providing security to al-
17
lies, NATO was established to promote democratic 
18
institutions and values ‘‘by strengthening their free 
19
institutions, by bringing about a better under-
20
standing of the principles upon which these institu-
21
tions are founded, and by promoting conditions of 
22
stability and well-being’’.
