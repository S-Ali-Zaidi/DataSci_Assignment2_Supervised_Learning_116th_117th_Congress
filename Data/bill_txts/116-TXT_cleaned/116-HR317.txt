in the Black community and the importance of reducing 
maternal mortality and morbidity among Black women; 
Whereas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, Black mothers in the United States are three 
to four times as likely to die from pregnancy-related 
causes as White mothers; 
Whereas Black women in the United States suffer from life- 
threatening pregnancy complications, known as ‘‘mater-
nal morbidities’’, twice as often as White women; 
Whereas maternal mortality rates in the United States are— 
(1) among the highest in the developed world; and 
(2) increasing rapidly; 
Whereas the United States has the highest maternal mor-
tality rate among affluent countries, in part because of 
the disproportionate mortality rate of Black mothers; 
Whereas Black women are 49 percent more likely than White 
women to deliver prematurely; 
Whereas the high rates of maternal mortality among Black 
women span across— 
(1) income levels; 
(2) education levels; and 
(3) socioeconomic status; 
Whereas structural racism, gender oppression, and the social 
determinants of health inequities experienced by Black 
women in the United States significantly contribute to 
the disproportionately high rates of maternal mortality 
and morbidity among Black women; 
Whereas racism and discrimination play a consequential role 
in maternal health care, experiences, and outcomes;

•HRES 317 IH 
Whereas a fair distribution of resources, especially with re-
gard to reproductive health care services and maternal 
health programming, is critical to closing the maternal 
health racial disparity gap; 
Whereas, even as there is growing concern about improving 
access to mental health services, Black women are least 
likely to have access to mental health screenings, treat-
ment, and support before, during, and after pregnancy; 
Whereas justice-informed, culturally congruent models of care 
are beneficial to Black women; and 
Whereas an investment must be made in— 
(1) maternity care for Black women; and 
(2) policies that support and promote affordable, 
comprehensive, and holistic maternal health care that is 
free from gender and racial discrimination: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives recog-
1
nizes—

(1) that Black women are experiencing high,

disproportionate rates of maternal mortality and 
4
morbidity in the United States; 
5
(2) that the alarmingly high rates of maternal 
6
mortality among Black women are unacceptable; 
7
(3) that, in order to better mitigate the effects 
8
of systemic and structural racism, Congress must 
9
work toward ensuring that the Black community 
10
has—
