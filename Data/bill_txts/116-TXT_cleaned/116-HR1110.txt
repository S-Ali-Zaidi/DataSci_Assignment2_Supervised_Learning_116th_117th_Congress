has long-standing bipartisan support in Congress and 
among the American people; 
Whereas the UAE is the first Gulf Arab state to announce 
formal relations with Israel, followed by Bahrain;

strategic benefit for participating countries and can be 
mutually beneficial for important sectors such as invest-
ment, finance, health, civil space, civil aviation, foreign 
policy and diplomatic affairs, and tourism and culture; 
Whereas following the agreement, the UAE formally abol-
ished its boycott law, allowing UAE companies and indi-
viduals to trade directly with Israel;

peace or normalization agreements between Israel and 
other Arab and Muslim countries; 
Whereas the parties pledged to continue their efforts to 
achieve a just, comprehensive, and enduring resolution to 
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict; 
Whereas the agreements build upon the decades-long leader-
ship of the United States in helping Israel broker peace 
treaties with Egypt and Jordan and promoting peace 
talks between Israel and Syria, Lebanon, and the Pal-
estinians; 
Whereas the United States played a pivotal role in brokering 
both agreements, which follow years of diplomacy be-
tween the United States, Israel, the United Arab Emir-
ates, Bahrain and other partners, encouraging coopera-
tion between Israel and Gulf countries;
