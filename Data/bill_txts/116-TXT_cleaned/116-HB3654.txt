SEC. 2. FINDINGS; STATEMENT OF PURPOSE. 
1
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) In 1972, coverage was established under the 
3
Medicare program for beneficiaries to receive chiro-
4
practic care. 
5
(2) Unfortunately, the antiquated statute re-
6
stricts beneficiaries to one service in a chiropractic 
7
clinic and Medicare chiropractic coverage has not 
8
kept up with private sector coverage and other fed-
9
eral health delivery systems. 
10
(3) Today, due to positive evidence-based out-
11
comes and cost effectiveness of the services provided 
12
by doctors of chiropractic, private coverage for chiro-
13
practic services has evolved and State licensure for 
14
chiropractors has advanced to meet patient needs 
15
and health outcomes. 
16
(4) This Act would bring Medicare chiropractic 
17
coverage more in line with that provided with the 
18
Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of De-
19
fense, the Federal Employee Health Benefits Pro-
20
gram, and private health insurance coverage. 
21
(b) PURPOSE.—It is the purpose of this Act to ex-
22
pand recognition and coverage of a doctor of chiropractic 
23
as a ‘‘physician’’ under the Medicare program in connec-
24
tion with the performance of any function or action, in-
25
cluding current service of ‘‘manual manipulation of the
