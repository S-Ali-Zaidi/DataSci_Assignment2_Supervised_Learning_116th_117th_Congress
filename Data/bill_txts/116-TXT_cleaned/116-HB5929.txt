3
port or oppose political causes;

13
of corporations they own; 
14
(5) shareholders and the public have a right to 
15
know how corporate managers are spending com-
16
pany funds to make political contributions and ex-
17
penditures benefitting candidates, political parties, 
18

19
(6) corporations should be accountable to share-
20
