ing support for the Iranian people’s desire for a demo-
cratic, secular, and non-nuclear republic of Iran. 
Whereas, on July 2, 2018, the Belgian Federal Prosecutor’s

gle for freedom;

Whereas several prominent bipartisan former United States 
Government officials, several retired United States gen-
erals, congressional staff, and thousands of American 
citizens participated in that gathering; 
Whereas Assadollah Assadi, a senior Iranian diplomat based 
in the Iranian embassy in Vienna, Austria, was arrested 
in Germany in connection with the planned terror plot in 
Paris; 
Whereas the Iranian diplomat has been charged in Belgium 
in connection with the Paris terror plot and in Germany 
with ‘‘activity as a foreign agent and conspiracy to com-
mit murder’’; 
Whereas the Free Iran gathering had commenced to show 
support for the Iranian opposition leader Mrs. Maryam 
Rajavi’s 10-point plan for the future of Iran, which calls 
for the universal right to vote, free elections, and a mar-
ket economy, and advocates gender, religious, and ethnic 
equality, a foreign policy based on peaceful coexistence, 
and a non-nuclear Iran; 
Whereas, on July 10, 2018, a senior Department of State of-
ficial said, ‘‘Iran uses embassies as cover to plot terrorist 
attacks’’, and that ‘‘The most recent example is the plot 
that the Belgians foiled, and we had an Iranian diplomat 
out of the Austrian embassy as part of the plot to bomb 
a meeting of Iranian opposition leaders in Paris’’; 
Whereas, in January 2019, the European Union (EU) has in-
cluded the Internal Security Division of the Iranian Min-
istry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS), and two of its 
officials on the EU terror list in connection with the 
Paris bomb plot;

Whereas the United States Government arrested two Iranian 
nationals in August 2018 who had acted on behalf of the 
MOIS to conduct covert surveillance in the United States 
against officials of the National Council of Resistance of 
Iran for a target package, which, according to the De-
partment of Justice Federal complaint, may include ‘‘ap-
prehension, recruitment, cyber exploitation, or capture/ 
kill operations’’; 
Whereas according to the Select Iran-Sponsored Operational 
Activity in Europe, released by the Department of State 
on July 5, 2018, ‘‘Two Iranian operatives were arrested 
on charges of terrorism by Albanian authorities,’’ for a 
bomb plot against the March 2018 New Year gathering 
of thousands of Iranian opposition members in Tirana; 
Whereas, in December 2018, the Government of Albania ex-
pelled Iran’s Ambassador, Gholamhossein Mohammadnia, 
and MOIS station chief in Albania, Mostafa Roudaki, for 
planning terrorist activities against Iranian dissidents 
and members of the People’s Mojahedin Organization of 
Iran (PMOI/MEK); 
Whereas the expulsion of the Iranian Ambassador by the 
Government of Albania is a positive and important step, 
which sends the right message that no Iranian embassies 
should be used for plotting terror and conducting spying 
activities against dissidents; 
Whereas Iran’s malign activities in the Balkans, specifically 
its presence and activities in Albania, pose a serious 
threat to United States national security interests; 
Whereas the Department of State official has urged ‘‘all na-
tions to be vigilant about Iran using embassies as diplo-
matic cover to plot terrorist attacks’’;

Whereas senior Iranian Government, military, judicial, and 
security officials have for decades ordered or committed 
egregious human rights violations and acts of terror; 
Whereas the Iranian people have been deprived of their fun-
damental freedoms for which reason they rejected 
monarchic dictatorship and are opposing religious tyr-
anny; and 
Whereas in the 115th Congress, the House of Representa-
tives passed H.R. 4744 calling on the United States to 
‘‘condemn Iranian human rights abuses against dis-
sidents, including the massacre in 1988 and the suppres-
sion of political demonstrations in 1999, 2009, and 2017, 
and pressure the Government of Iran to provide family 
members detailed information that they were denied 
about the final resting places of any missing victims of 
such abuses’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) condemns past and present Iranian state- 
2
sponsored terrorist attacks against United States

citizens and officials, as well as Iranian dissidents,
