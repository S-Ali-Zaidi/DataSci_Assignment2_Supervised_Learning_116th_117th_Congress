A BILL 
To provide that certain Executive orders with respect to 
Federal employee collective bargaining shall have no 
force or effect, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Protecting Collective 
4
Bargaining and Official Time for Federal Workers Act’’. 
5
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Federal unions play a critical role in pro-
8
tecting the rights of Federal workers by allowing

members to have a collective voice on the job and in 
1
the legislative process, advance issues for working 
2
families, ensure equal opportunities for all workers, 
3
and raise the standards by which all professional 
4
and technical workers are employed. 
5
(2) Collective bargaining is essential to the 
6
union process, because it provides mutual agreement 
7
between all parties that fosters harmonious relation-
8
ships between the Federal Government and its em-
9
ployees and protects the interest of both parties. 
10
(3) The current administration has acted 
11
through Executive orders and official memorandums 
12
to dismantle Federal unions and undermine their 
13
collective bargaining rights across the Federal work-
14
force and these directives have already negatively 
15
impacted labor contracts, both signed and under ac-
16
tive negotiation. 
17
(4) These orders set an aggressive schedule for 
18
unions to engage in collective bargaining, while also 
19
slashing the unions official time for performing 
20
union duties by over 91 percent in some cases. 
21
These actions are limiting the ability for unions to 
22
prepare for negotiations and perform their legally re-
23
quired employee representational duties.

•HR 6246 IH
(5) Section 7101(a) of title 5, United States 
1
Code, states, ‘‘Congress finds that labor organiza-
2
tions and collective bargaining in the civil service are 
3
in the public interest.’’. Attempting to eliminate the 
4
union by eliminating almost all its official time repu-
5
diates the statutory position that unions are in the 
6
public interest. 
7
(6) Through these orders, agencies are required 
8
to comply with artificial bargaining schedules, which 
9
undermine good faith negotiations and divert the de-
10
cision making to an impasse panel, which has no 
11
union representation on it and does not represent 
12
both parties. 
13
(7) Collectively, the administration’s actions 
14
have violated congressional intent, undermined the 
15
ability of unions to engage in collective bargaining, 
16
and threatened the rights and benefits of millions of 
17
Federal workers.
