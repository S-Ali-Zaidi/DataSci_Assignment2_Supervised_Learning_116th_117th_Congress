‘‘(2) Some adopted children experience trauma, 
12
and the disruption and placement in another home 
13
by unregulated custody transfer creates additional

trauma and instability for children.

‘‘(3) Children who experience an unregulated 
16

17
have not completed required child welfare or crimi-
18
nal background checks or clearances.

‘‘(4) Social services agencies and courts are 
20
often unaware of the placement of children through

20
