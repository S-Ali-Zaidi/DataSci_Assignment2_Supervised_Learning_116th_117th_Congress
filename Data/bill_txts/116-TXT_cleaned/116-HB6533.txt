(1) According to a report by the Department of 
1
Defense published in July 2019 titled ‘‘Maternal and 
2
Infant Mortality Rates in the Military Health Sys-
3
tem,’’ between January 2009 and June 2018, the 
4
military health system achieved a pregnancy-related 
5
mortality ratio of 7.40 deaths per 100,000 live 
6
births across both direct care and purchased card 
7
systems. Over the same period, the National 
8
Perinatal Information Center ratio was a statis-
9
tically significantly higher ratio of 11.3 deaths per 
10
100,000 live births. 
11
(2) The same report by the Department of De-
12
fense found that the military health system’s infant 
13
mortality rate of 2.51 deaths per 1,000 live births 
14
was statistically significantly lower than the Na-
15
tional Perinatal Information Center rate of 4.76 
16
deaths per 1,000 live births. 
17
(3) In the United States, the maternal mor-
18
tality rate remains unfortunately high. Some States 
19
experience rates as high as 24.3 deaths per 100,000 
20
live births. 
21
(4) A report by the Centers for Disease Control 
22
published in May 2019 on pregnancy-related deaths 
23
found that nearly 60 percent of such deaths are pre-
24
ventable with improved medical care.
