or her behalf) a complaint with the Secretary of 
10
Labor (referred to in this section as the ‘‘Sec-
11
retary’’) alleging such discharge or discrimination 
12
and identifying employer or employers responsible 
13
for such act. Upon receipt of such a complaint, the

Secretary shall notify, in writing, the employer or 
15
employers named in the complaint of the filing of 
16
the complaint, of the allegations contained in the 
17
complaint, of the substance of evidence supporting 
18

after the date of receipt of a complaint filed

03:58 Jun 07, 2019
H2984
5 
•HR 2984 IH
reasonable cause to believe that the complaint 
1
has merit and notify, in writing, the complain-
2
ant and the employer or employers alleged to 
3
have committed a violation of subsection (a)(1) 
4
of the Secretary’s findings. The Secretary shall, 
5
during such investigation afford the complain-
6
ant and the employer or employers named in 
7
the complaint an opportunity to submit to the 
8
Secretary a written response to the complaint 
9
and an opportunity to meet with a representa-
10
tive of the Secretary to present statements from

with an opportunity to review the information

15
rebuttal by such the complaint, as part of such

(B) REASONABLE CAUSE FOUND; PRELIMI-
18

19
there is reasonable cause to believe that a viola-
20

21
retary shall accompany the Secretary’s findings

with a preliminary order providing the relief 
23
prescribed by paragraph (3)(B).

6
cluding the dismissal of the complaint, in whole 
7
or in part, and request a hearing on the record 
8
before an administrative law judge of the De-
9
partment of Labor. Any such hearing shall be 
10
conducted expeditiously. If a hearing is not re-
11
quested in such 30-day period, the preliminary 
12
order shall be deemed a final order that is not 
13
subject to judicial review. The filing of such ob-
14
jections shall not operate to stay any reinstate-
15
ment remedy contained in the preliminary order 
16
issued under subparagraph (B). The Secretary 
17
of Labor is authorized to enforce preliminary 
18
reinstatement orders in the United States dis-

filed under this subsection and shall not 
1
conduct an investigation otherwise required 
2
under subparagraph (A) unless the com-
3
plainant makes a prima facie showing that 
4
any behavior described in subparagraphs 
5
(A) through (G) of subsection (a)(1) was a 
6
contributing factor in the adverse action 
7
alleged in the complaint. 
8
(ii) STANDARD FOR EMPLOYER.—Not-
9
withstanding a finding by the Secretary 
10
that the complainant has made the show-
11
ing required under clause (i), no investiga-
12
tion otherwise required under subpara-
13
graph (A) shall be conducted if the em-
14
ployer demonstrates, by clear and con-
15
vincing evidence, that the employer would 
16
have taken the same adverse action in the 
17
absence of that behavior. 
18
(iii) 
VIOLATION
STANDARD.—The 
19
Secretary may determine that a violation 
20
of subsection (a)(1) has occurred only if 
21
the complainant demonstrates that any be-
22
havior described in subparagraphs (A) 
23
through (G) of such subsection was a con-
24

tributing factor in the adverse action al-
1
leged in the complaint. 
2
(iv) RELIEF STANDARD.—Relief may 
3
not be ordered under subparagraph (A) if

7
in the absence of that behavior.

(A) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 90 days

11
under subsection (b)(2)(B), the administrative 
12

the relief provided under this paragraph or 
14
deny the complaint. At any time before issuance 
15
of an order, a proceeding under this subsection 
16
may be terminated on the basis of a settlement 
17
agreement entered into by the Secretary, the 
18
complainant, and the person alleged to have 
19
committed the violation. Such a settlement may 
20
not be agreed by such parties if it contains con-
21
ditions which conflict with rights protected 
22
under this Act, are contrary to public policy, or 
23
include a restriction on a complainant’s right to
