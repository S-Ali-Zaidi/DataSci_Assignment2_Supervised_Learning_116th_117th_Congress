A BILL 
To amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to improve 
protections against foreign influence at institutions of 
higher education, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Intelligence on Nefar-
4
ious Foreign Leaders Using Education Networks for Cor-
5
rupt Enrichment Act’’ or the ‘‘INFLUENCE Act’’. 
6
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
7
Congress finds the following: 
8
(1) Schools in the United States, especially in-
9
stitutions of higher education overseeing either sen-

sitive research or critical military technology sys-
1
tems, have provided a level of access to the Chinese 
2
government that the Chinese government has re-
3
fused to provide to the United States. 
4
(2) China’s control over the flow of information 
5
means the American people have an incomplete pic-
6
ture of Chinese government actions and policies that 
7
run counter to the interest of the United States at 
8
home and abroad. 
9
(3) In the last 15 years, the Chinese govern-
10
ment has opened over 100 Confucius Institutes on 
11
college and university campuses in the United States 
12
to increase their cultural standing in popular cul-
13
ture. While there are currently more than 500 Con-
14
fucius Institutes worldwide, the United States has 
15
more Confucius Institutes than any other country. 
16
(4) Federal Government officials have expressed 
17
concerns about Confucius Institutes. Christopher 
18
Wray, Director of the Federal Bureau of Investiga-
19
tion, testified that the FBI is ‘‘watching warily’’ 
20
Confucius Institutes and ‘‘in certain instances have 
21
developed appropriate investigative steps’’. 
22
(5) The Department of Education has not con-
23
ducted regular oversight of the compliance of institu-
24
tions of higher education with foreign gift reporting 
25

requirements and, until recently, has failed to ade-
1
quately enforce the requirements of section 117 of 
2
the Higher Education Act of 1965 (relating to dis-
3
closures of foreign gifts). The Department of Edu-
4
cation maintains a database detailing the reporting 
5
of foreign gifts received by institutions, but relies 
6
solely on the institutions to self-report gifts. 
7
(6) The Department of Education is updating 
8
the reporting requirements applicable to institutions 
9
of higher education. Previously, the Department of 
10
Education had not issued guidance on foreign gift 
11
reporting by institutions of higher education since 
12
2004. As a result, institution’s informed Congress 
13
that the reporting requirements were unclear and 
14
confusing. Institutions also informed Congress that 
15
the Department of Education website used to report 
16
foreign gifts was dated and difficult to use. 
17
(7) Absent full transparency regarding how 
18
Confucius Institutes operate and full reciprocity for 
19
the cultural outreach efforts of the United States on 
20
college campuses in China, Confucius Institutes 
21
should not continue in the United States unchecked 
22
or unsupervised.
