To defer the removal of individuals to the Lao People’s 
Democratic Republic for a 72-month period, and for 
other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Hmong and Lao Ref-
4
ugee Deportation Prohibition Act of 2020’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Since 1975, nearly 200,000 refugees from 
8
the Lao People’s Democratic Republic (Lao P.D.R),

including persons of Hmong, Lao, Khmu, and Mien 
1
or Yao descent, have resettled in the U.S. as perma-
2
nent residents or become citizens. 
3
(2) Beginning in the 1950s in Laos, Hmong 
4
soldiers fought the Communist Pathet Lao move-
5
ment, and many Hmong and Lao later assisted U.S. 
6
forces during the Vietnam War. 
7
(3) The House Judiciary Committee reported in 
8
2000, ‘‘At great personal peril and loss of life, the 
9
Hmong fought with American forces and performed 
10
critical roles in dangerous missions.’’. 
11
(4) A former CIA officer stated to the Sub-
12
committee 
on 
Immigration 
and 
Claims 
that, 
13
‘‘[t]hroughout the war, CIA’s paramilitary forces 
14
collected intelligence, used it in combat operations to 
15
tie down some 50,000 North Vietnamese forces in 
16
Laos, rescued downed American pilots and protected 
17
sensitive American installations at remote mountain 
18
tops . . .’’. 
19
(5) Public Law 106–207, the Hmong Veterans 
20
Naturalization Act of 2000, provided thousands of 
21
Hmong refugees resettled to the U.S. who served 
22
with a special guerrilla unit, or irregular forces, op-
23
erating from a base in Laos in support of the United 
24
States military at any time during the period begin-

ning February 28, 1961, and ending September 18, 
1
1978, with exemptions from certain provisions of the 
2
Immigration and Naturalization Act. 
3
(6) In 2000, it was reported by the House Judi-
4
ciary Committee in Report 106–563 that ‘‘many 
5
Hmong refugees have found it difficult to naturalize 
6
because of a difficulty learning English. This is due 
7
to the facts that they came from a tribal society 
8
without a written language until recent decades and 
9
that many Hmong were recruited to be guerrillas at 
10
the age of 12–14 and hence did not attend school.’’. 
11
(7) Scholars argue that the U.S. insufficiently 
12
resettled refugees from Laos leaving many ill-pre-
13
pared for immediate work, unacculturated, and suf-
14
fering psychosocial trauma resulting in cycles of pov-
15
erty. In 2016, 37.8 percent of Hmong and 18.5 per-
16
cent of Lao in the U.S. were living in poverty. 
17
(8) There are currently over 4,700 long-time 
18
U.S. residents of Hmong, Lao, Khmu, and Mien or 
19
Yao descent with Final Orders for Removal who 
20
were born in the Lao P.D.R., fled persecution in 
21
Laos, were resettled in the U.S. as refugees, and 
22
now face deportation to Laos due to past criminal 
23
convictions.

(9) Individuals with Final Orders for Removal 
1
who could be deported to the Lao P.D.R. often do 
2
not speak the Lao language, lack familial connec-
3
tions, and are at risk of being a target for human 
4
rights abuses as a result of historic support for U.S. 
5
anti-communist policies. 
6
(10) A 2018 Department of State Laos Human 
7
Rights Report acknowledges the long record of 
8
human rights abuses in the Lao P.D.R. The report 
9
states, ‘‘The government neither prosecuted nor 
10
punished officials who committed abuses, and police 
11
and security forces committed human rights abuses 
12
with impunity.’’. 
13
(11) The Lao P.D.R. is a communist state that 
14
does not currently have an official deportation agree-
15
ment with the U.S. and there is no extradition trea-
16
ty between Laos and the U.S. 
17
(12) Many of the over 4,700 persons with Final 
18
Orders of Removal who are at risk of deportation to 
19
the Lao P.D.R. have not been able to seek adequate 
20
immigration relief based on the complexity of the re-
21
quired legal filings and the backlogs in immigration 
22
courts. It can take several years for an individual to 
23
seek to reopen their immigration case and have their

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
3
It is the sense of the Congress that— 
4
(1) individuals of Hmong, Lao, Khmu, and 
5
Mien or Yao descent who arrived in the U.S. as ref-
6
ugees fleeing persecution in the Lao People’s Demo-
7
cratic Republic shall not be deported to Laos for a 
8
period of 72 months; and 
9
(2) the Trump administration’s efforts to de-
10
port more than 4,700 individuals of Hmong, Lao, 
11
Khmu, and Mien or Yao descent residing in the U.S. 
12
to the Lao People’s Democratic Republic puts these 
13
individuals at grave risk, is unnecessary to ensure 
14
public safety, and cruelly inflicts trauma and harm 
15
on Hmong-American and Lao-American families and 
16
communities that are making significant contribu-
17
tions to the strength and success of the U.S.
