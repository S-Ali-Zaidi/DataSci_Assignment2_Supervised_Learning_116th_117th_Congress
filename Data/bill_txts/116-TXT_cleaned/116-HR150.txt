RESOLUTION 
Commemorating the 100th anniversary of the Elaine 
massacre. 
Whereas between September 30 and October 1, 1919, an un-
known number of African Americans were murdered in a 
racially motivated riot; 
Whereas the violence erupted when the unionization of share-
croppers was falsely portrayed as a Black insurrection 
against White landowners; 
Whereas estimates range between 100 to 240 victims, making 
the massacre one of the worst instances of mass racial 
violence in United States history; 
Whereas official investigations were only made into the 
deaths of 5 White people who were also killed in the vio-
lence;

Whereas those investigations resulted in the prosecution of 
122 African Americans; and 
Whereas subsequent litigation resulted in the historic United 
States Supreme Court decision of Moore et al. v. Demp-
sey in 1923, the first Supreme Court case regarding the 
treatment of African Americans in State criminal justice 
systems, setting a precedent for future review of State 
criminal convictions: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) honors the lives and legacies of the un-
2
known number of African Americans who were mur-
3
dered in Phillips County, Arkansas, 100 years ago; 
4
(2) expresses its deepest sympathies to the fam-
5
ilies of the victims; and 
6
(3) recognizes the role the massacre played in 
7
strengthening United States citizens’ due process 
8
rights through Moore v. Dempsey, which set a prece-
9
dent for the Supreme Court’s subsequent review of 
10
State criminal trials and their compliance with the 
11
Bill of Rights.
