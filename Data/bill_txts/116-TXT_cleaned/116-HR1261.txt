RESOLUTION 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives on 
addressing the reckless and unsustainable national debt 
while committing necessary resources to the COVID– 
19 pandemic. 
Whereas, in January 2020, prior to the COVID–19 pan-
demic, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected 
that for fiscal year 2020, United States deficit spending 
would total nearly $1,020,000,000,000, the first trillion- 
dollar deficit in history not caused by the Great Reces-
sion;

Whereas, in January 2020, prior to the pandemic, the CBO 
projected United States debt-to-GDP would rise from 80 
percent to 98 percent by 2030; 
Whereas even in the absence of the COVID–19 pandemic, our 
Nation’s fiscal situation was precarious and rapidly dete-
riorating; 
Whereas, throughout 2020, COVID–19 has had a significant 
impact on the health of our fellow citizens, our economy, 
and our fiscal stability; 
Whereas 25,000,000 people were immediately put out of 
work; 
Whereas in response to the health crisis, lockdowns, and an 
economic downturn, Congress passed a series of legisla-
tive packages totaling more than $3,600,000,000,000 to 
support hospitals, families, small businesses, schools, and 
local governments; 
Whereas as a result of these necessary measures, our fiscal 
condition is far worse than ever before; 
Whereas the ability to respond appropriately to emergencies 
is part of responsible budgeting and an important reason 
to control the debt during periods of economic strength; 
Whereas the fiscal year 2020 budget deficit exceeded 
$3,100,000,000,000, 
more 
than 
three 
times 
the 
prepandemic projection; 
Whereas the total deficit in 2020 was 16.0 percent of the Na-
tion’s gross domestic product (GDP), up from 4.6 per-
cent in 2019 and 3.8 percent in 2018, and the deficit was 
the largest as a percentage of GDP since 1945; 
Whereas the gross debt of the United States Government, 
which includes both debt held by the public and debt held

by 
Federal 
trust 
funds, 
now 
exceeds 
$27,000,000,000,000; 
Whereas the national debt for fiscal year 2020 has now ex-
ceeded the size of the entire United States economy, and 
the debt-to-GDP ratio will soon reach the highest level 
ever and is expected to continue rising at an 
unsustainable rate; and 
Whereas we recognize the need to provide temporary and tar-
geted support to those affected by the pandemic, includ-
ing future assistance: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives— 
1
(1) recognizes that an unprecedented response 
2
to provide relief to hundreds of millions of Ameri-
3
cans was required to address the COVID–19 pan-
4
demic; 
5
(2) realizes that additional relief measures are 
6
required; 
7
(3) believes that further efforts to address the 
8
COVID–19 pandemic must include measures and re-
9
forms to help Congress restore the Federal Govern-
10
ment’s long-term fiscal health once the pandemic 
11
ends and the economy regains its strength; and 
12
(4) believes Congress should promote the return 
13
to regular order and deliberation, and to change the 
14
broken and dysfunctional budget practices that
