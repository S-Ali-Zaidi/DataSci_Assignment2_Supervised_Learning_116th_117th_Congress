A BILL 
To modify permitting requirements with respect to the dis-
charge of any pollutant from the Point Loma Wastewater 
Treatment Plant in certain circumstances, and for other 
purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Ocean Pollution Re-

Congress finds the following:

•HR 4611 IH
(1) In 1972, Congress passed the Federal 
1
Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, 
2
which required publicly owned treatment works to 
3
achieve secondary treatment capability by 1977. 
4
(2) In 1994, the United States District Court 
5
for the Southern District of California determined 
6
that upgrading the City of San Diego’s Point Loma 
7
Wastewater Treatment Plant (in this Act referred to 
8
as the ‘‘Point Loma Plant’’) to secondary treatment 
9
standard would not be in the public interest, being 
10
excessively costly without producing additional envi-
11
ronmental benefits. 
12
(3) The Point Loma Plant currently meets all 
13
the requirements of secondary treatment except for 
14
the removal of total suspended solids and bio-
15
chemical oxygen demand. 
16
(4) At the direction of Congress, the Environ-
17
mental Protection Agency (in this Act referred to as 
18
the ‘‘EPA’’) requested that the National Research 
19
Council advise the agency on ways to improve waste-
20
water management in coastal urban areas. The re-
21
sulting study ‘‘Managing Wastewater in Coastal 
22
Urban Areas’’ produced several important findings, 
23
including— 
24
23:13 Oct 07, 2019

•HR 4611 IH
(A) biochemical oxygen demand discharged 
1
through a well-designed outfall is generally not 
2
of ecological concern in open coastal waters; 
3
(B) total suspended solids can be ade-
4
quately controlled by advanced primary treat-
5
ment and high dilution outfalls; and 
6
(C) over-control is particularly likely along 
7
ocean coasts, but nevertheless full secondary 
8
treatment is required regardless of cost or lack 
9
of benefits. 
10
(5) Past reviews by the City of San Diego, the 
11
EPA, the State of California, and scientists affili-
12
ated with the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, 
13
the University of California, San Diego, and other 
14
organizations have concluded the Point Loma Plant 
15
does not have any known significant adverse effect 
16
on the ocean environment outside the immediate 
17
area of the discharge. 
18
(6) The ocean outfall for the Point Loma Plant 
19
discharges effluent 4.5 miles from the coast at a 
20
depth of over 300 feet, one of the longest and deep-
21
est ocean outfalls in the world. 
22
(7) Implementing full secondary treatment 
23
standards at the Point Loma Plant will cost approxi-
24
mately $1,800,000,000.

•HR 4611 IH
(8) Implementing full secondary treatment 
1
standards at the Point Loma Plant is contrary to 
2
the national interest, in that it will compromise 
3
views from the Cabrillo National Monument and 
4
interfere with the Navy’s use of adjacent property. 
5
(9) The City of San Diego generates all the en-
6
ergy it needs to operate the Point Loma Plant onsite 
7
through co-generation. Implementing full secondary 
8
treatment will turn a ‘‘green’’ facility into one of the 
9
region’s largest energy consumers, requiring the pur-
10
chase of over $17,000,000 each year in electricity 
11
and producing more than 100,000 tons of green-
12
house gas emissions annually. 
13
(10) Implementing full secondary treatment 
14
standards at the Point Loma Plant will require re-
15
moval of 1,250,000 tons of earth from environ-
16
mentally sensitive habitat immediately adjacent to 
17
the Point Loma Ecological Reserve. 
18
(11) Recognizing the unique situation sur-
19
rounding the Point Loma Plant, Congress adopted 
20
the Ocean Pollution Reduction Act (OPRA). OPRA 
21
allowed the Point Loma Plant to avoid conversion to 
22
full secondary treatment and instead operate under 
23
a modified permit according to standards contained 
24

•HR 4611 IH
in sections 301(h) and 301(j)(5) of the Federal 
1
Water Pollution Control Act, as modified by OPRA. 
2
(12) The City of San Diego has complied with 
3
all requirements of OPRA and the results have been 
4
significant, including reduction in the discharge of 
5
total suspended solids and biochemical oxygen de-
6
mand, advanced ocean monitoring, and construction 
7
of 45,000,000 gallons per day of treatment capacity 
8
to produce reclaimed water at a cost of approxi-
9
mately $340,000,000. 
10
(13) This Act will capitalize on the record of 
11
improvements initiated under OPRA and provide a 
12
framework for further enhancements to the City of 
13
San Diego’s water and wastewater systems, in-
14
creased potable water reliability, and additional 
15
meaningful environmental protection. 
16
(14) The City of San Diego has completed its 
17
Water Purification Demonstration Project showing 
18
that municipal wastewater can successfully be treat-
19
ed to levels suitable for potable reuse. The City of 
20
San Diego completed its Recycled Water Study in 
21
2012 describing how wastewater can be diverted 
22
from the Point Loma Plant to new treatment facili-
23
ties to generate water suitable for potable reuse. 
24
Through the construction and operation of new

•HR 4611 IH
treatment facilities to produce 83,000,000 gallons 
1
per day of water suitable for potable reuse, the City 
2
of San Diego is expected to reduce the total sus-
3
pended solids discharged by the Point Loma Plant 
4
to the same or lower levels as would be achieved by 
5
implementing full secondary treatment, while cre-
6
ating an important new local source of water. 
7
(15) The City of San Diego currently relies on 
8
imported water for over 85 percent of its water sup-
9
ply. A new local source of water can significantly re-
10
duce the environmental impacts of importing water 
11
to San Diego from the Colorado River and the Cali-
12
fornia Bay-Delta by offsetting the City’s demand for 
13
imported water. 
14
(16) Due to the severe drought in California, 
15
the 2014 water allocation from the State Water 
16
Project was only 5 percent of normal, forcing water 
17
agencies to draw down water reserves, implement 
18
mandatory conservation measures, and search for 
19
new, dependable sources of water.
