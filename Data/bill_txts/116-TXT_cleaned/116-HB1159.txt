1
The purposes of this Act are— 
2
(1) to encourage the research and use of inno-
3
vative materials, in concert with traditional mate-
4

5
and preservation of the domestic infrastructure net-
6
work; 
7
(2) to accelerate the deployment and extend the 
8
service life, improve the performance, and reduce the 
9
cost of infrastructure projects; and 
10
(3) to improve the economy, resilience, main-
11
tainability, sustainability, and safety of the domestic 
12
infrastructure network.
