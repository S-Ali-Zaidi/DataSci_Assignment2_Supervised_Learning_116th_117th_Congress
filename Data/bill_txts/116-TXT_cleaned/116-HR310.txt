RESOLUTION 
Reaffirming the unique collaboration among United States 
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), including faith- 
based organizations, and the Israel Defense Forces to 
deliver humanitarian assistance to Syrians. 
Whereas the Syrian civil war, now in its eighth year, has 
forced 14,000,000 Syrians to flee, more than half of the 
country’s pre-war population, with 6,500,000 internally 
displaced people (IDPs) still within the country; 
Whereas ‘‘Operation Good Neighbor’’ is a program of the 
Israel Defense Forces to provide humanitarian relief to 
Syrians; 
Whereas Operation Good Neighbor worked with United 
States nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to help 
forge unprecedented partnerships between the Israel De-

fense Forces (IDF) and Syrian NGOs, which opened a 
new channel for the delivery of humanitarian assistance; 
Whereas, as a result, food, fuel, medicine, ambulances, and 
medical supplies were flowing cross-border from Israel 
into southern Syria; 
Whereas this new channel permitted these goods to arrive at 
Israeli ports, and be trucked by the IDF through Israel 
to the border with Syria; 
Whereas at the border, the IDF transferred these containers 
to Syrian NGOs for transport and distribution to IDPs 
and local residents in previously hard-to-reach locations 
in southern Syria; 
Whereas United States NGOs, including faith-based organi-
zations, facilitated the relationships between the Syrian 
NGOs and the IDF by providing overall coordination and 
support for this regional cooperation to help promote re-
gional peace through a multifaceted humanitarian relief 
operation; 
Whereas the program initially reached only villages along the 
border, but expanded to a broader area of southern 
Syria, and as deliveries continued on a sustained basis, 
the initiative ultimately reached an even greater popu-
lation; and 
Whereas in addition to the value of the humanitarian relief 
itself, the Syrian/Israeli partnerships, created and rein-
forced through the success of the new channel, dem-
onstrated the value of cooperation and continues to serve 
as a role model for strengthened positive relations be-
tween Syrians and Israelis: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives hereby

reaffirms the unique collaboration between United States
