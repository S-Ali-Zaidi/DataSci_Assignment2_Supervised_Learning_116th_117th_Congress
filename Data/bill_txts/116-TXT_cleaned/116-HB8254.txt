SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Although the relative rate of end-stage renal 
3
disease (referred to in this section as ‘‘ESRD’’) 
4
among the Nation’s minority populations has de-
5
clined, significant disparities remain. Compared to 
6
Whites, Black Americans are 2.6 times more likely 
7
to have kidney failure, while Native Americans and 
8
Alaska Natives are 1.2 times more likely. Hispanics 
9
are 1.3 times more likely to have kidney failure com-
10
pared to non-Hispanics. 
11
(2) Disparities also exist with respect to treat-
12
ment modalities. Specifically, although home dialysis 
13
can offer advantages, Black, Hispanic, and Native 
14
American and Alaska Native ESRD patients are less 
15
likely to initiate home treatment than White ESRD 
16
patients. 
17
(3) Numerous studies show that individuals 
18
with low incomes and in low-income communities are 
19
at greater risk for ESRD. 
20
(4) In addition to their kidney disease, ESRD 
21
patients across all races and ethnicities often suffer 
22
from one or more comorbidities. Eighty-eight per-
23
cent of ESRD patients have a history of hyper-
24
tension, 42 percent have diabetes, and nearly 30 
25
percent have congestive heart failure. 
26
21:19 Sep 25, 2020
H8254

•HR 8254 IH
(5) Each month, ESRD patients see multiple 
1
providers and take several medications to manage 
2
their kidney disease and comorbid conditions. Of all 
3
patients, those with ESRD stand to benefit greatly 
4
from better coordinated care. 
5
(6) The Executive Order on Advancing Amer-
6
ican Kidney Health recognizes the need to develop 
7
and implement new ESRD care delivery models to 
8
improve quality and value for ESRD patients and 
9
the Medicare program. 
10
(7) In alignment with that goal, it is imperative 
11
that Medicare test new models that have at their 
12
core an interdisciplinary care team, among other 
13
structural requirements, to— 
14
(A) help ESRD patients better navigate 
15
the health care system; 
16
(B) empower such patients to manage 
17
their plan of care and medication regimen; 
18
(C) support such patients in receiving the 
19
treatment modality, including a kidney trans-
20
plant, as prescribed by their nephrologist; 
21
(D) access services to meet the nonclinical 
22
needs of such patients that can affect care out-
23
