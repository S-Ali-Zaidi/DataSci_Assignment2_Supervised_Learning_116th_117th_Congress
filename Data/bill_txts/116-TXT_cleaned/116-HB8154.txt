SEC. 2. BROADCAST INCUBATOR PROGRAM. 
1
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Our Nation continues to respond to the on-
3
going COVID–19 pandemic, and all Americans must 
4
have access to accurate, reliable information. 
5
(2) Americans are fighting racial injustice, and 
6
promoting local and diverse media will play an im-
7
portant role in limiting misinformation. 
8
(3) Congress should commit to promoting 
9
media diversity and pledging to work with media en-
10
tities and diverse stakeholders to develop common- 
11
ground solutions to eliminate barriers to media di-
12
versity. 
13
(4) The principle that an informed and engaged 
14
electorate is critical to a vibrant democracy is deeply 
15
rooted in our laws of free speech and underpins the 
16
virtues on which we established our Constitution: ‘‘in 
17
Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Jus-
18
tice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the 
19
common defence, promote the general Welfare, and 
20
secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our 
21
Posterity’’. 
22
(5) Having independent, diverse, and local 
23
media that provide exposure to a broad range of 
24
viewpoints and the ability to contribute to the polit-
25
05:02 Sep 05, 2020
H8154

•HR 8154 IH
ical debate is central to sustaining informed engage-
1
ment. 
2
(6) It is in the public interest to encourage 
3
source, content, and audience diversity on our Na-
4
tion’s shared media platforms. 
5
(7) The survival of small, independent, and di-
6
verse media outlets that serve diverse audiences and 
7
local media markets is essential to preserving local 
8
culture and building understanding on important 
9
community issues that impact the daily lives of resi-
10
dents. 
11
(8) Research by the American Society of News 
12
Editors, the Radio Television Digital News Associa-
13
tion, the Pew Research Center, and others has docu-
14
mented the continued challenges of increasing diver-
15
sity among all types of media entities. 
16
(9) With increasing media experience and so-
17
phistication, it is even more important to have mi-
18
nority participation in local media to ensure a di-
19
verse range of information sources are available and 
20
different ideas and viewpoints are expressed to 
21
strengthen social cohesion among different commu-
22
nities. 
23
(10) The constriction in small, independent, 
24
and diverse media outlets and limited participation 
25
05:02 Sep 05, 2020
H8154

•HR 8154 IH
of diverse populations in media ownership and deci-
1
sionmaking are combining to negatively impact our 
2
goal of increasing local civic engagement and civic 
3
knowledge through increased voter participation, 
4
membership in civic groups, and knowledge of local 
5
political and civil information. 
6
(11) The Advisory Committee on Diversity and 
7
Digital Empowerment of the Commission, and pred-
8
ecessor Federal advisory committees, have rec-
9
ommended for decades that the Commission adopt 
10
an incubator program providing structural rule 
11
changes to facilitate new and diverse entrants into 
12
the marketplace. 
13
(12) The Broadcast Incubator Program estab-
14
lished under this section is consistent with the na-
15
tional policy described in section 257(b) of the Com-
16
munications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 257(b)): ‘‘to 
17
promote the policies and purposes of this Act favor-
18
ing diversity of media voices, vigorous economic com-
19
petition, technological advancement, and promotion 
20
of the public interest, convenience, and necessity’’. 
21
(b) ESTABLISHMENT.—Not later than 270 days after 
22
the date of the enactment of this Act, the Commission 
23
shall promulgate regulations establishing a program, to be
