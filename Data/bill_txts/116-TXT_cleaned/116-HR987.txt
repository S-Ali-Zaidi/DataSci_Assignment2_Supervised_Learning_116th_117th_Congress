Raising awareness regarding period poverty. 
Whereas National Period Poverty Awareness Week is recog-
nized on May 25 through May 31, 2020; 
Whereas, since 2013, Menstrual Hygiene Day is annually 
commemorated on May 28 to raise awareness and cata-
lyze action around the challenges menstruation poses to 
individuals around the world; 
Whereas more than half of the United States population will 
likely menstruate every month for decades of their lives; 
Whereas menstrual products are a necessity each month for 
millions of people across the country; 
Whereas studies have shown that 1 in 4 women and girls re-

Whereas this lack of menstrual products, often called ‘‘period 
poverty’’, can adversely affect a person’s health and well- 
being; 
Whereas studies have shown that 1 in 5 women and girls re-
ports missing work or school due to a lack of access to 
menstrual products; 
Whereas period poverty exacerbates the vicious cycle of pov-
erty by further marginalizing those who menstruate, 
causing them to withdraw from daily life, forego pay, or 
miss educational opportunities; 
Whereas period poverty can increase the risk of infections, 
because of the use of substitutes, such as paper towels 
or toilet paper, or because of an inability to change prod-
ucts as frequently as recommended; 
Whereas period poverty existed long before the COVID–19 
pandemic; 
Whereas the COVID–19 pandemic has forced millions of peo-
ple out of work, and thereby exacerbated the socio-
economic and health challenges of individuals facing pe-
riod poverty; 
Whereas menstrual products are essential to the health and 
economic well-being of individuals in both overcoming and 
recovering from the COVID–19 pandemic; and 
Whereas frontline health care workers in the fight against the 
COVID–19 pandemic have reported the challenges of 
working extended shifts in full-body protective gear while 
managing their periods, and that their overall menstrua-
tion needs have been overlooked: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
