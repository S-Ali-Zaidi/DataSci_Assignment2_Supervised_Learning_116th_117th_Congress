INDIVIDUAL BANKRUPTCY

SEC. 101. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. 
3
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that— 
4
(1) individuals and families are often in finan-
5
cial distress for reasons outside of their control, such 
6
as job loss, medical bills, or educational debt, and an 
7
effective bankruptcy system not only provides those 
8

•HR 8902 IH
individuals and families with a fresh start but also 
1
ensures that they can participate fully in the United 
2
States economy; 
3
(2) the Bankruptcy Code was adopted in 1978, 
4
and, since then, consumer lending has grown dra-
5
matically and been transformed by technology and 
6
the preemption of State usury and consumer protec-
7
tion laws for certain types of lenders; 
8
(3) unnecessary paperwork and overly complex 
9
laws increase the cost of bankruptcy and prevent in-
10
dividuals and families in the United States who need 
11
help from accessing the bankruptcy system; 
12
(4) many consumer debtors cannot afford bank-
13
ruptcy counsel and must instead save up to pay an 
14
attorney to file their bankruptcy petitions; 
15
(5) the dual-track bankruptcy system produces 
16
racially disparate outcomes that disadvantage people 
17
of color; 
18
(6) student loan debt burdens are creating dis-
19
tortions in the labor and housing market; 
20
(7) the nondischargeability of private student 
21
loan debt has not resulted in lower financing costs 
22
for student loan borrowers; 
23
(8) the inability of debtors to restructure home 
24
mortgage loans has led to unnecessary foreclosures 
25
00:27 Jan 06, 2021
H8902
4 
•HR 8902 IH
that have created hardships for individuals and fam-
1
ilies and their communities without reducing costs of 
2
mortgage financing; 
3
(9) individuals and families often rely on their 
4
cars to get to work and to get dependents to school 
5
and medical appointments but often cannot retain 
6
their cars in bankruptcy without paying substan-
7
tially more than the car is worth; 
8
(10) the difficulty of enforcing the discharge in-
9
junction has enabled illegal debt collection activity 
10
that undercuts the fresh start policy of bankruptcy; 
11
(11) existing law does not provide a sufficient 
12
deterrent to predatory creditors that harm individ-
13
uals and families in bankruptcy by violating con-
14
sumer financial laws or failing to comply with bank-
15
ruptcy rules; and 
16
(12) well-counseled, affluent debtors can avoid 
17
repaying creditors through asset protection planning. 
18
(b) PURPOSE.—The purpose of the Act is to establish 
19
a bankruptcy system that helps individuals and families 
20
in the United States regain financial stability and protects 
21
against abusive and predatory behavior by— 
22
(1) streamlining the process of filing for bank-
23
ruptcy, simplifying court procedures in bankruptcy, 
24
00:27 Jan 06, 2021
H8902
5 
•HR 8902 IH
and lowering the cost of bankruptcy for both con-
1
sumers and creditors; 
2
(2) creating a single-chapter consumer bank-
3
ruptcy system that allows consumers greater flexi-
4
bility in addressing their debts and prevents dis-
5
parate treatment of similarly situated consumers; 
6
(3) offering consumers more and better options 
7
to deal with debts, while ensuring the fair treatment 
8
of creditors; 
9
(4) making it easier for consumers to pay an 
10
attorney for counsel or representation in a bank-
11
ruptcy case; 
12
(5) simplifying the identification and treatment 
13
of cases by expanding the number of routine cases 
14
that are handled by the court in which there is no 
15
chance of a reasonable payment to creditors and re-
16
ducing paperwork requirements in those routine 
17
cases; 
18
(6) allowing the modification of mortgages on 
19
all residences; 
20
(7) allowing the modification of car loans based 
21
on the market value of a car; 
22
(8) allowing the discharge of student loan debt 
23
on equal terms with most other types of debt; 
24
00:27 Jan 06, 2021
H8902

•HR 8902 IH
(9) reducing racial, gender, and other harmful 
1
disparities in the availability, accessibility, costs, and 
2
outcomes with respect to the bankruptcy process; 
3
(10) ensuring the fair treatment of claimants 
4
for domestic support obligations; 
5
(11) reducing abusive creditor behavior; and 
6
(12) closing bankruptcy loopholes that allow the 
7
wealthy to exploit the bankruptcy process.
