SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress makes the following findings: 
2
(1) There is strong global support for actions 
3
that limit the severity of climate change. 
4
(2) On September 18, 2019, more than 200 
5
representatives of environmental groups, human 
6
rights groups, indigenous peoples, workers, and aca-
7
demia adopted a declaration calling on governments 
8
to urgently address environmental damage, including 
9
by increasing the pressure on those most responsible 
10
for climate change. 
11
(3) The United States Government has devel-
12
oped and implements targeted measures to restrict 
13
access to the United States financial system for spe-
14
cific individuals and entities involved in conduct in-
15
cluding malicious cyber-enabled activity, transnation-
16
al organized crime, narcotics trafficking, terrorism, 
17
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, human 
18
rights abuse, and corruption. Those conduct-based 
19
measures apply globally and are not focused on any 
20
specific country. 
21
(4) As of the date of the enactment of this Act, 
22
the United States Government seeks to apply exist-
23
ing sanctions authorities against individuals and en-
24
tities engaged in wildlife trafficking. On January 30, 
25
2018, the Office of Foreign Assets Control des-
26
19:24 Jan 17, 2020

•HR 5625 IH
ignated an organization for engaging in illicit activi-
1
ties including the trafficking of endangered and vul-
2
nerable animals such as black bears, pangolins, ti-
3
gers, rhinoceroses, and elephants. 
4
(5) Climate change has disproportionate impact 
5
on poorer communities and individuals in less devel-
6
oped countries. Targeted measures against individ-
7
uals and entities most responsible for exacerbating 
8
climate change could help ensure that efforts to ad-
9
dress climate change do not worsen global inequal-
10
ity. 
11
(6) Development of carbon-intensive electrical 
12
power plants is continuing across the developing 
13
world through new foreign investments, despite 
14
broad awareness of the dangers. 
15
(7) The current investment plans of countries 
16
likely to receive significant foreign energy invest-
17
ments may lead to an excess build-out of fossil fuel 
18
assets and create carbon ‘‘lock-in’’ absent urgent ac-
19
tion. 
20
(8) Governments that are investing in or direct-
21
ing foreign investment toward legacy fossil fuel en-
22
ergy generation often lack the incentive to formulate 
23
more efficient or sustainable national energy policies. 
24
19:24 Jan 17, 2020
H5625
4 
•HR 5625 IH
Those governments are thus likely to default to es-
1
tablished but harmful forms of energy generation. 
2
(9) Alternatives to carbon-intensive electrical 
3
power generation are now available and technological 
4
advancements continue to strengthen the economic 
5
competitiveness of such alternatives. 
6
(10) Corruption is especially harmful when indi-
7
viduals who abuse positions of influence for personal 
8
gain can simultaneously cause great damage to the 
9
global commons by facilitating significant increases 
10
in the emission of, or decreases in the absorption of, 
11
greenhouse gases. 
12
(11) Deforestation is doubly damaging because 
13
it undercuts the absorption of carbon dioxide, while 
14
also raising greenhouse gas emissions. 
15
(12) According to the Intergovernmental Panel 
16
on Climate Change, most pathways to limit warming 
17
to well below 2 degrees Celsius require reduced de-
18
forestation in concert with reforestation, afforesta-
19
tion, and bioenergy efforts. 
20
(13) From 2013 to 2019, some of the largest 
21
financial institutions in the world provided tens of 
22
billions of dollars in financing to entities either di-
23
rectly or indirectly deforesting the largest rainforests 
24
in the world. Most financial institutions have no in-

ternal policy covering dealings in key forest-risk 
1
commodities. 
2
(14) On September 22, 2019, 130 financial in-
3
stitutions worth $47,000,000,000,000 collectively, 
4
representing 1⁄3 of the global industry, signed on to 
5
the United Nations-backed Principles for Respon-
6
sible Banking, committing to strategically align their 
7
businesses with the goals of the agreement of the 
8
parties to the United Nations Framework Conven-
9
tion on Climate Change, done at Paris December 12, 
10
2015, and entered into force November 4, 2016 (in 
11
this Act referred to as the ‘‘Paris Climate Agree-
12
ment’’), and the Sustainable Development Goals 
13
adopted by all United Nations member countries in 
14
2015. 
15
(15) Illegal deforestation causes environmental 
16
harm while promoting criminal activity. In the Bra-
17
zilian Amazon, criminal networks with the capacity 
18
to coordinate large-scale extraction, processing, and 
19
sale of timber deploy armed personnel to protect 
20
their interests. They regularly kill and threaten peo-
21
ple who stand in the way of criminal activity, includ-
22
ing members of indigenous communities and envi-
23
ronmental enforcement officials. Perpetrators of vio-
24
lence are rarely brought to justice. 
25
19:24 Jan 17, 2020
H5625
6 
•HR 5625 IH
(16) Between 2002 and 2017, 1,558 people in 
1
50 countries were killed for defending their environ-
2
ments and lands. Environmental defenders currently 
3
face a wave of violence that includes threats of phys-
4
ical harm, intimidation, and criminalization. 
5
(17) Policies and measures to address climate 
6
change must also promote human rights, thereby ad-
7
vancing equality, justice, and dignity for all, in line 
8
with the Sustainable Development Goals of the 
9
United Nations.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON A COMPREHENSIVE AP-
11
PROACH TO ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE. 
12
It is the sense of Congress that— 
13
(1) the restrictive measures described in this 
14
Act are only one component of the comprehensive 
15
approach needed to address climate change and miti-
16
gate its effects; 
17
(2) the United States Government must ensure 
18
through law and regulation that United States enti-
19
ties are not engaged in any of the egregious behav-
20
iors for which foreign persons may be targeted 
21
under this Act; 
22
(3) the United States Government must recom-
23

24
any successor agreement;

(4) the United States Government must fulfill 
1
its pledges to the Green Climate Fund and promote 
2
international efforts to support climate change adap-
3
tation and mitigation; 
4
(5) the United States Government must work 
5
proactively with foreign governments, including by 
6
offering positive incentives, to address climate 
7
change and to promote economic development in 
8
ways that do not needlessly increase carbon emis-
9
sions or increase the risk of corruption; 
10
(6) the restrictive measures described in this 
11
Act should be employed if engagement has failed to 
12
prevent significant actions that exacerbate climate 
13
change; and 
14
(7) given broad international support for coun-
15
tering climate change, the Secretary of State should 
16
encourage the governments of other countries to im-
17
plement restrictive measures that are similar to the 
18
provisions of this Act in order to increase the effec-
19
tiveness of actions taken by the United States to 
20
combat significant actions that exacerbate climate 
21
change, including related corruption and human 
22
rights violations.
