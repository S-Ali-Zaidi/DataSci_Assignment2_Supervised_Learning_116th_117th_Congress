A BILL 
To nullify certain executive actions to permit the delayed 
withholding and deposit of payroll taxes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS. 
3
(a) SHORT TITLE.—This Act may be cited as the 
4
‘‘Save our Social Security Now Act’’. 
5
(b) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) Social Security is Americans’ commitment 
7
to each other; it is the foundation of retirement se-

curity and provides nearly all workers and their fam-
1
ilies with essential insurance protections for retire-
2
ment, disability, or death of a family breadwinner. 
3
(2) Americans are relying on Social Security 
4
more than ever during the COVID-19 pandemic 
5
which is harming the very Americans who most rely 
6
on Social Security, our seniors, people with disabil-
7
ities, women and people of color. 
8
(3) Americans have consistently ranked Social 
9
Security as one of the most important Federal pro-
10
grams. 
11
(4) Social Security enjoys deep and sustained 
12
public support because it is a benefit workers earn 
13
through their payroll contributions with each and 
14
every paycheck under the Federal Insurance Con-
15
tributions Act (FICA). 
16
(5) 65 million people, or nearly 1 in 3 house-
17
holds, receive their earned Social Security benefits 
18
each month, including seniors, widows, people with 
19
disabilities, children, and veterans. 
20
(6) Social Security’s progressive benefit for-
21
mula, family benefits, and disability and survivor 
22
protections make the program especially important 
23
to communities of color and to women, as it partially 
24
mitigates the systemic inequalities in the rest of the 
25

retirement system, which mirror systemic inequal-
1
ities in the labor market. 
2
(7) Social Security’s guaranteed benefits lift 22 
3
million Americans out of poverty each year, and 
4
allow millions more to live with dignity after their 
5
retirement or disability. 
6
(8) Social Security pays $1 trillion in benefits 
7
each year, and beneficiaries return those funds to 
8
their local economies in every Congressional District 
9
in the nation when they pay for their homes, gro-
10
ceries, and medical care. 
11
(9) Social Security functions as an automatic 
12
stabilizer and economic stimulus during recessions, 
13
and the current economic and public health crises 
14
make the program’s role more important than ever, 
15
as beneficiaries can count on its monthly payments 
16
as a reliable source of income. 
17
(10) At its inception 85 years ago, Social Secu-
18
rity was created by President Roosevelt as an earned 
19
benefit program where workers’ benefits are fun-
20
damentally linked to their earnings from work. 
21
(11) Payroll deductions under the FICA are the 
22
contributions that workers and their employers pay 
23
into Social Security, and represent the direct link 
24
between earnings and benefits.

(12) These payroll contributions provide a se-
1
cure and dedicated source of revenue to finance the 
2
earned benefits. 
3
(13) Eliminating these payroll contributions 
4
would end Social Security, making it unable to pay 
5
any disability benefits beginning in 2021 and unable 
6
to pay any retirement or survivor benefits beginning 
7
in 2023. 
8
(14) Social Security is irreplaceable and has 
9
been a cornerstone of our nation’s social compact for 
10
more than three-quarters of a century. 
11
(15) The President’s recent executive action to 
12
defer payroll taxes from September through Decem-
13
ber 2020 is the first step in his announced plan to 
14
entirely defund Social Security by eliminating pay-
15
roll contributions altogether beginning in 2021. 
16
(16) Eliminating the payroll tax would destroy 
17
Social Security and with it the financial stability of 
18
generations of retirees, widows, children, and people 
19
with severe disabilities. 
20
(17) Therefore, Congress rejects the President’s 
21
proposals to defer now and eliminate later the pay-
22
roll contributions which fund Social Security’s 
23
earned benefits.
