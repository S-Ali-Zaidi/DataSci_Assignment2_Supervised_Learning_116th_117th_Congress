A BILL 
To ban the practice of hydraulic fracturing, and for other 
purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Fracking Ban Act’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
5
Congress finds that— 
6
(1) the chemicals injected into the ground dur-
7
ing the hydraulic fracturing process include acids,

detergents, and toxic chemicals that put drinking 
1
water at risk; 
2
(2) hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, extracts 
3
natural gas containing methane, a greenhouse gas 
4
that traps more than 86 times the heat of carbon di-
5
oxide in the short term; 
6
(3) the process of fracking results in further 
7
methane leakages that could increase carbon pollu-
8
tion in the United States by 25 percent by 2050; 
9
(4) fracked natural gas is not a bridge fuel, as 
10
previously understood; 
11
(5) even if every coal plant were replaced by 
12
fracked gas electricity by 2030, emissions would re-
13
main on track to grow through 2050 due in part to 
14
pervasive methane leaks that make fracked gas as 
15
dangerous as coal; 
16
(6) similarly, even if methane leaks could be to-
17
tally eliminated, the direct emissions from burning 
18
the huge volumes of natural gas the United States 
19
plans to produce in the next decade do not fit in safe 
20
climate scenarios; 
21
(7) the American Petroleum Institute reports 
22
that ‘‘up to 95% of natural gas wells in the next 
23
decade in the United States will be fracked’’; 
24

(8) renewable energy and storage eliminate any 
1
need for fracked gas; 
2
(9) all the technologies needed to support a 
3
transition to 100 percent renewable electricity exist 
4
at commercial scale and equal or cheaper costs com-
5
pared to fossil fuels; 
6
(10) significant carbon reductions are impos-
7
sible if even 10 percent of electricity comes from 
8
natural gas going forward; 
9
(11) in some instances, fracking operations vio-
10
late property rights by taking the land of property 
11
owners for drilling and transportation of fracked 
12
gas; 
13
(12) in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, the 
14
Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Company, or 
15
Transco, seized private land and began construction 
16
for a fracked gas pipeline before the landowners 
17
could appear in court to protest and once the land-
18
owners did file an official protest, the Federal En-
19
ergy Regulatory Commission allowed Transco to 
20
continue construction while the case was decided in 
21
court; 
22
(13) scientists, along with governmental agen-
23
cies in the United States and Canada, report that 
24
fracking and fracking wastewater injections can be

linked to earthquakes all across North America, in-
1
cluding in the States of Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, 
2
Texas, Kansas, and Arkansas and in British Colum-
3
bia; 
4
(14) fracking contaminates ground and surface 
5
water with toxic chemicals though waste discharge, 
6
underground migration of fracking gas and chemi-
7
cals into drinking water sources, and spills; 
8
(15) numerous scientific studies have shown 
9
that the chemicals referred to in paragraph (14) 
10
cause serious negative health impacts such as cancer 
11
and birth defects; 
12
(16) in addition to toxic chemicals injected un-
13
derground, fracking fluid traveling back up to the 
14
surface contains additional toxic substances such as 
15
heavy metals, arsenic, barium, strontium, uranium, 
16
radium, and radon; 
17
(17) fracking pollutes the air and substantially 
18
contributes to ground-level ozone, which can cause 
19
serious negative health impacts such as strokes, 
20
heart attacks, and asthma; 
21
(18) research shows that expectant mothers liv-
22
ing near heavy fracking in the State of Pennsylvania 
23
were significantly more likely to experience a high- 
24
risk pregnancy or give birth prematurely;

(19) studies have linked drilling and fracking to 
1
elevated incidences of infant deaths, high-risk preg-
2
nancies, and low birth weight in the States of Colo-
3
rado and Texas; 
4
(20) the fracking industry regularly disposes of 
5
waste that will remain radioactive for thousands of 
6
years by spraying it on roads next to homes and 
7
farms; 
8
(21) the climate crisis represents a national 
9
emergency to the future stability, prosperity, and 
10
general welfare of the United States and a growing 
11
body of scientific research has demonstrated that 
12
leakage, venting, and flaring of methane and other 
13
greenhouse gases in the course of oil and gas pro-
14
duction and transmission significantly contributes to 
15
increased climate change; 
16
(22) a global rise in temperatures of more than 
17
1.5 degrees Celsius would result in irreversible and 
18
catastrophic changes to public health, livelihoods, 
19
quality of life, food security, water supplies, human 
20
security, and economic growth; 
21
(23) limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius re-
22
quires global carbon pollution emissions to be cut in 
23
half by 2030, and completely eliminated by 2050;

(24) the United States is on track to account 
1
for 60 percent of world growth in oil and gas pro-
2
duction by 2030 and extract enough new oil and gas 
3
by 2050 to make it impossible to avoid a rise in tem-
4
peratures of more than 1.5 degrees Celsius; 
5
(25) fracking can expose workers to toxic sub-
6
stances like radon, the second-leading cause of lung 
7
cancer in the United States, in concentrations hun-
8
dreds of times more radioactive than the legal limit 
9

(36) the Interstate Commerce Clause of section

(41) hydraulic fracturing activities and related

infrastructure create public nuisances for local com-
