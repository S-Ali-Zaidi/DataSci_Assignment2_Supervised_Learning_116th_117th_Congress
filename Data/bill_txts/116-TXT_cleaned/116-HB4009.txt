•HR 4009 IH
(1) Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (re-
1
ferred to in the section as ‘‘title VI’’) is one of the 
2
principal antidiscrimination statutes enforced by the 
3
Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights. 
4
(2) Title VI prohibits discrimination on the 
5
basis of race, color, or national origin. 
6
(3) Both the Department of Justice and the 
7
Department of Education have properly concluded 
8
that title VI prohibits discrimination against Jews, 
9
Muslims, Sikhs, and members of other religious 
10
groups when the discrimination is based on the 
11
group’s actual or perceived shared ancestry or ethnic 
12
characteristics or when the discrimination is based 
13
on actual or perceived citizenship or residence in a 
14
country whose residents share a dominant religion or 
15
a distinct religious identity. 
16
(4) A September 8, 2010, letter from Assistant 
17
Attorney General Thomas E. Perez to Assistant Sec-
18
retary for Civil Rights Russlynn H. Ali stated that 
19
‘‘[a]lthough Title VI does not prohibit discrimination 
20
on the basis of religion, discrimination against Jews, 
21
Muslims, Sikhs, and members of other groups vio-
22
lates Title VI when that discrimination is based on 
23
the group’s actual or perceived shared ancestry or 
24
ethnic characteristics’’.

(5) To assist State and local educational agen-
1
cies and schools in their efforts to comply with Fed-
2
eral law, the Department of Education periodically 
3
issues Dear Colleague letters. On a number of occa-
4
sions, these letters set forth the Department of Edu-
5
cation’s interpretation of the statutory and regu-
6
latory obligations of schools under title VI. 
7
(6) On September 13, 2004, the Department of 
8
Education issued a Dear Colleague letter regarding 
9
the obligations of schools (including colleges) under 
10
title VI to address incidents involving religious dis-
11
crimination. The 2004 letter specifically notes that 
12
‘‘since the attacks of September 11, 2001, OCR has 
13
received complaints of race or national origin harass-
14
ment commingled with aspects of religious discrimi-
15
nation against Arab Muslim, Sikh, and Jewish stu-
16
dents.’’. 
17
(7) An October 26, 2010, Dear Colleague letter 
18
issued by the Department of Education stated, 
19
‘‘While Title VI does not cover discrimination based 
20
solely on religion, groups that face discrimination on 
21
the basis of actual or perceived shared ancestry or 
22
ethnic characteristics may not be denied protection 
23
under Title VI on the ground that they also share 
24
a common faith. These principles apply not just to

Jewish students, but also to students from any dis-
1
crete religious group that shares, or is perceived to 
2
share, ancestry or ethnic characteristics (e.g., Mus-
3
lims or Sikhs).’’. 
4
(8) Anti-Semitism, and harassment on the basis 
5
of actual or perceived shared ancestry or ethnic 
6
characteristics with a religious group, remains a per-
7
sistent, disturbing problem in elementary and sec-
8
ondary schools and on college campuses. 
9
(9) Students from a range of diverse back-
10
grounds, including Jewish, Arab Muslim, and Sikh 
11
students, are being threatened, harassed, or intimi-
12
dated in their schools (including on their campuses) 
13
on the basis of their shared ancestry or ethnic char-
14
acteristics including through harassing conduct that 
15
creates a hostile environment so severe, pervasive, or 
16
persistent so as to interfere with or limit some stu-
17
dents’ ability to participate in or benefit from the 
18
services, activities, or opportunities offered by 
19
schools. 
20
(10) The 2010 Dear Colleague letter cautioned 
21
schools that they ‘‘must take prompt and effective 
22
steps reasonably calculated to end the harassment, 
23
eliminate any hostile environment, and its effects, 
24
and prevent the harassment from recurring,’’ but

did not provide guidance on current manifestations 
1
of anti-Semitism, including discriminatory anti-Se-
2
mitic conduct that is couched as anti-Israel or anti- 
3
Zionist. 
4
(11) The definition and examples referred to in 
5
paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 3 have been valu-
6
able tools to help identify contemporary manifesta-
7
tions of anti-Semitism, and include useful examples 
8
of discriminatory anti-Israel conduct that crosses the 
9
line into anti-Semitism. 
10
(12) Awareness of this definition of anti-Semi-
11
tism will increase understanding of the parameters 
12
of contemporary anti-Jewish conduct and will assist 
13
the Department of Education in determining wheth-
14
er an investigation of anti-Semitism under title VI 
15
is warranted. 
16
