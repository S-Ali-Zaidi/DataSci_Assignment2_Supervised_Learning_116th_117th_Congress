SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
22
Congress finds the following: 
23
(1) Landlords often make their largest profit 
24
margins in low-income neighborhoods. This is in 
25
23:22 May 20, 2020
H6768

•HR 6768 IH
part due to the difference between the perceived risk 
1
of low-income tenants defaulting on their rent and 
2
the actual risk. 
3
(2) A significant proportion of eviction money 
4
judgments—in some jurisdictions, potentially more 
5
than 40 percent—are for less than 1 month’s rent, 
6
based on median rent per census tract. 
7
(3) According to the book ‘‘Evicted: Poverty 
8
and Profit in the American City’’ by Matthew 
9
Desmond, families and individuals who are evicted 
10
are more likely to experience a decline in mental and 
11
physical health, have poor attendance in school, and 
12
have more trouble holding a job. 
13
SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
14
It is the sense of Congress that— 
15
(1) landlord-tenant mediation is a valuable and 
16
cost-effective way to keep tenants in their homes, 
17
and more investment in that type of mediation is 
18
warranted; 
19
(2) there is a lack of research on the potential 
20
for certain types of insurance to be cost-effective 
21
interventions that keep tenants in their homes, 
22
which warrants future study; 
23
(3) eviction should be a last resort; and 
24

•HR 6768 IH
(4) reducing the number of small-dollar evic-
1
tions will produce a substantial return on investment 
2
for individuals and families and for society as a 
3
whole.
