mental rights, including transparent pricing and terms, 
competitive products, responsible underwriting, fair treat-
ment from financing providers, brokers, and lead genera-
tors, inclusive credit access, and fair collection practices.

the United States, accounting for 99 percent of all firms;

tion and competitiveness in the United States and are in-
tegral to the Nation’s overall economic growth and pros-
perity; 
Whereas according to the National Small Business Associa-
tion, 73 percent of small firms used financing in the last 
12 months; 
Whereas entrepreneurs throughout the country face chal-
lenges accessing the capital needed to create, sustain, and 
grow small businesses and at the same time, are increas-
ingly targeted with irresponsible lending practices; 
Whereas a small business borrower has the right to have the 
cost and terms of any financing being offered presented 
to them in writing and in a form that is clear, complete, 
and easy to compare with other financing options, so they 
can make the best decision for their business; 
Whereas a small business borrower has the right to expect 
that financing products will not trap his or her business 
in an expensive cycle of reborrowing; 
Whereas a small business borrower has the right to expect 
that financing is offered to them based on underwriting 
practices that assess the ability of the borrower’s busi-
ness to succeed and repay;

transparent, and impartial communications with all fi-
nancing providers, brokers, and lead generators regarding 
loan options, conflicts of interest, fees, and the financing

Act; 
Whereas a small business borrower has the right to be treat-
ed fairly and respectfully throughout a collections process 
and the right to protections like those guaranteed under

Whereas a small business borrower has the right to expect 
that financing providers do not use confessions of judg-
ment or equivalent legal agreements by which a borrower 
preemptively agrees to lose disputes with the financing 
provider: Now, therefore, be it
