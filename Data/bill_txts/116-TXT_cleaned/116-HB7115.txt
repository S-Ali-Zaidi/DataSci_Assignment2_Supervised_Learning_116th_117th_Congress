7
(1) Section 1 of the Act entitled ‘‘An Act to en-

to the Constitution of the United States and for

other purposes’’ (commonly known as the ‘‘Civil 
1
Rights Act of 1871’’), approved April 20, 1871 (17 
2
Stat. 13, chapter 22) was enacted by Congress to 
3
provide a Federal forum to which a civil cause of ac-
4
tion could be brought by any citizen of the United 
5
States or other person within the jurisdiction there-
6
of, for the deprivation of any right, privilege or im-
7
munity secured by the Constitution or by Federal 
8
statute. 
9
(2) Congress was granted the authority to enact 
10
the Civil Rights Act of 1871 by sections 1 and 5 of 
11
the Fourteenth Amendment of Constitution of the 
12
United States. 
13
(3) Popularly known as the ‘‘Anti-Ku Klux 
14
Klan Act’’, the statute was enacted to provide a 
15
Federal remedy to fight the ‘‘Klan’s reign of terror’’ 
16
in the southern states, as reflected in President 
17
Grant’s message to Congress on March 23, 1871, 
18
which stated that the Klan had ‘‘render[ed] life and 
19
property insecure’’ and that the ‘‘power to correct 
20
these evils [was] beyond the control of state authori-
21
ties’’. 
22
(4) A Joint Committee from each House of 
23
Congress addressed the problem, and the Commit-
24
tee’s product was the Civil Rights Act of 1871, from

which section 1979 of the Revised Statutes was de-
1
rived (42 U.S.C. 1983), which reads as follows: 
2
‘‘Every person who, under color of any statute, ordi-
3
nance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or 
4
Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or 
5
causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United 
6
States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof 
7
to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immu-
8
nities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be 
9
liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit 
10
in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress, ex-
11
cept that in any action brought against a judicial of-
12
ficer for an act or omission taken in such officer’s 
13
judicial capacity, injunctive relief shall not be grant-
14
ed unless a declaratory decree was violated or de-
15
claratory relief was unavailable. For the purposes of 
16
this section, any Act of Congress applicable exclu-
17
sively to the District of Columbia shall be considered 
18
to be a statute of the District of Columbia.’’.

(5) Decisions of the United States Supreme 
20
Court, beginning with Monell v. New York City De-
21
partment of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658 (1978), 
22
have held that governmental entities are not respon-
23
sible or liable for damages caused by their agents or 
24
employees who, in the course and scope of their em-

ployment, violate the constitutional rights of citizens 
1
and other persons within the jurisdiction of the 
2
United States. 
3
(6) Decisions of the United States Supreme 
4
Court, beginning with Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 
5
U.S. 800 (1982), have established the doctrine of 
6
‘‘qualified immunity’’, absolving the individual 
7
wrongdoers themselves of liability for even the most 
8
egregious violations of the Constitution unless there 
9
exists a clearly established statutory or constitu-
10
tional precedent of which all reasonable public offi-
11
cials would have known. 
12
(7) To be a clearly established precedent, there 
13
must be a prior case whose ‘‘particularized facts’’ 
14
clearly place the statutory or constitutional question 
15
‘‘beyond debate’’. White v. Pauly, 137 S.Ct. 548, 
16
551–52 (2017). 
17
(8) Qualified immunity was not known at com-
18
mon law and has had the effect of nullifying the 
19
right to seek redress for constitutional violations un-
20
less a virtually identical set of facts existed in a case 
21
previously decided that is so well-known and recog-
22
nized that no reasonable public official would not 
23
have knowledge thereof.

(9) The failure to hold governmental entities, 
1
responsible for the constitutional violations of their 
2
agents or employees acting within the course and 
3
scope of their employment, together with the quali-
4
fied immunity the courts have granted the agents 
5
and employees from personal responsibility for their 
6
constitutional violations, deprive citizens of the 
7
United States and other persons within its jurisdic-
8
tion of an effective remedy for the deprivation of 
9
their rights, privileges or immunities secured by the 
10
Constitution and laws of the United States, and spe-
11
cifically, drastically weaken the remedy granted by 
12
section 1979 of the Revised Statutes (42 U.S.C. 
13
1983), making this bill which amends the section 
14
necessary in order to restore the purpose and intent 
15
of section 1979 of the Revised Statutes.

such act or omission if the act or omission of the person
