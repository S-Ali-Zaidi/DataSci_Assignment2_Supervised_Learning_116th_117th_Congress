RESOLUTION 
Expressing support for designation of February 12, 2019, 
as ‘‘Darwin Day’’ and recognizing the importance of 
science in the betterment of humanity. 
Whereas Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution by the mecha-
nism of natural selection, together with the monumental 
amount of scientific evidence he compiled to support it, 
provides humanity with a logical and intellectually com-
pelling explanation for the diversity of life on Earth; 
Whereas the validity of Darwin’s theory of evolution by nat-
ural selection is further strongly supported by the mod-
ern understanding of the science of genetics;

Whereas it has been the human curiosity and ingenuity exem-
plified by Darwin that has promoted new scientific dis-
coveries that have helped humanity solve many problems 
and improve living conditions; 
Whereas the advancement of science must be protected from 
those unconcerned with the adverse impacts of global 
warming and climate change; 
Whereas the teaching of creationism in some public schools 
compromises the scientific and academic integrity of the 
United States education systems; 
Whereas Charles Darwin is a worthy symbol of scientific ad-
vancement on which to focus and around which to build 
a global celebration of science and humanity intended to 
promote a common bond among all of Earth’s peoples; 
and 
Whereas February 12, 2019, is the anniversary of the birth 
of Charles Darwin in 1809 and would be an appropriate 
date to designate as ‘‘Darwin Day’’: Now, therefore, be 
it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—

2
and
