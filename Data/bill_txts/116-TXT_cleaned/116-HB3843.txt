SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Countering Russian 
2
and Other Overseas Kleptocracy Act’’ or the ‘‘CROOK 
3
Act’’. 
4
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
5
Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) Authoritarian leaders in foreign countries 
7
abuse their power to steal assets from state institu-
8
tions, enrich themselves at the expense of their coun-
9
tries’ economic development, and use corruption as 
10
a strategic tool both to solidify their grip on power 
11
and to undermine democratic institutions abroad. 
12
(2) Global corruption harms the competitiveness 
13
of United States businesses, feeds terrorist recruit-
14
ment and transnational organized crime, enables 
15
drug smuggling and human trafficking, and stymies 
16
economic growth. 
17
(3) Illicit financial flows often inconspicuously 
18
penetrate a country through what appears to be le-
19
gitimate financial transactions, as kleptocrats laun-
20
der money, use shell companies, amass offshore 
21
wealth, and participate in a global shadow economy. 
22
(4) The government of Vladimir Putin in Rus-
23
sia is the leading model of this type of foreign 
24
kleptocratic system, using corruption to erode demo-
25
cratic governance from within and discrediting de-
26

•HR 3843 IH
mocracy abroad, thereby strengthening his authori-
1
tarian rule. 
2
(5) Russia uses stolen money to— 
3
(A) purchase key assets in other countries, 
4
particularly with a goal of attaining monopo-
5
listic control of a sector; 
6
(B) gain access to and influence the poli-
7
cies of democratic countries; and 
8
(C) directly fund political parties and orga-
9
nizations that advance Russian interests in 
10
other countries, particularly those that under-
11
mine confidence and trust in democratic sys-
12
tems. 
13
(6) Thwarting these tactics by Russia and other 
14
kleptocratic governments requires the international 
15
community to strengthen democratic governance, the 
16
rule of law, and international cooperation in com-
17
bating illicit finance, especially by empowering re-
18
formers in foreign countries during historic political 
19
openings for the establishment of the rule of law in 
20
those countries. 
21
(7) New reformers in foreign countries must act 
22
quickly to seize political openings for anti-corruption 
23
reform, but as these reformers are often outsiders 
24
with little government experience, they may need sig-
