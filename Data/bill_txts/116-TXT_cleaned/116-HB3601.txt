A BILL 
To direct the Commissioner of Social Security to implement 
certain recordkeeping recommendations, and for other 
purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, 
2
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
3
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Social Security Integ-
4
rity Act of 2019’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) Individuals can commit various types of 
8
fraud against the Government by reporting earnings

under deceased individuals’ Social Security Numbers 
1
(SSNs). 
2
(2) Various Federal entities rely on the Social 
3
Security Administration’s (SSA) death information 
4
to detect unreported deaths and verify the accuracy 
5
of reported deaths. 
6
(3) The Numident is the SSA’s computer data-
7
base file on all who have applied for a Social Secu-
8
rity number. The Office of the Inspector General 
9
(OIG) of the SSA conducted an audit and deter-
10
mined that the SSA did not have controls in place 
11
to annotate death information on the Numident 
12
records of numberholders who exceeded maximum 
13
reasonable life expectancies and were likely deceased. 
14
(4) The OIG identified 34 cases in which it ap-
15
peared that the deceased numberholder’s name and 
16
Social Security Number (SSN) had been misused. In 
17
one instance an employer reported paying wages to 
18
someone 
from 
2008 
through 
2012 
using 
a 
19
numberholder’s name and SSN that had been born 
20
in 1886. SSA payment records indicated that the 
21
numberholder died in January 1965, but the SSA 
22
did not record the numberholder’s death on the 
23
Numident. SSA continued paying benefits to the 
24
numberholder’s widow until her death in February 
25

1973. SSA’s Master Earning File (MEF) contained 
1
no 
reported 
earnings 
information 
for 
this 
2
numberholder from 1956 through 2007. 
3
(5) The OIG determined that thousands of the 
4
SSNs could have been used to commit identity 
5
fraud. For tax years 2006 through 2011, SSA re-
6
ceived reports that individuals using 66,920 SSNs 
7
had approximately $3.1 billion in wages, tips, and 
8
self-employment income. SSA transferred the earn-
9
ings to the Earnings Suspense File because the em-
10
ployees’ or self-employed individuals’ names on the 
11
earnings reports did not match the numberholders’ 
12
names. 
13
(6) During calendar years 2008 through 2011, 
14
employers made 4,024 E-Verify inquiries using 
15
3,873 SSNs belonging to numberholders born before 
16
June 16, 1901. According to the OIG, these inquir-
17
ies indicate individuals’ attempts to use the SSNs to 
18
apply for work. 
19
(7) The OIG determined that resolving these 
20
discrepancies will improve the accuracy and com-
21
pleteness of the Death Master File and help prevent 
22
future misuse of these SSNs. 
23
(8) The American taxpayer deserves to have the 
24
surety of knowing that every agency and department 
25

•HR 3601 IH
within the Federal Government takes the prudent 
1
actions necessary to prevent future fraud and waste 
2
of hard-earned dollars. 
3
(9) In 2015, the OIG identified approximately 
4
6.5 million numberholders age 112 or older who did 
5
not have death information on the Numident. 
6
(10) Of the 6.5 million cases OIG identified, 
7
based on initial review, SSA believed approximately 
8
1.5 million of these individuals were deceased. After 
9
further in-depth analysis, SSA posted death infor-
10
mation to records for only those cases that passed 
11
complex identity matching protocols, and where the 
12
most current information indicated the individuals 
13
are in fact deceased. 
14
(11) For the remaining 5 million cases, the 
15
SSA reports that it does not have sufficient or reli-
16
able evidence that these individuals are deceased. 
17
However, the SSA also notes that the individuals 
18
have never received payments from the SSA; the 
19
records are decades old, and are the result of error- 
20
prone paper reporting processes; it is possible that, 
21
decades ago, SSA incorrectly recorded some dates of 
22
birth and that some individuals are much younger 
23
than current records indicate; and it would be im-
24
prudent to presume death in order to add these 
25

•HR 3601 IH
cases to the DMF because doing so could result in 
1
the inappropriate release of living individuals’ per-
2
sonally identifiable information—an action that has 
3
far-reaching and adverse consequences for these in-
4
dividuals. 
5
(12) In line with the OIG’s recommendations, 
6
the SSA should take proactive action to fully protect 
7
the American taxpayer by ensuring that there are 
8
comprehensive controls in place to annotate death 
9
information 
on 
the 
Numident 
records 
of 
10
numberholders who exceeded maximum reasonable 
11
life expectancies.
