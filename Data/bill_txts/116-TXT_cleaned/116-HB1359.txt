to the Internet in order to catalyze innovation, spur 
1
economic growth and job creation, improve health, 
2
education, and financial services, reduce poverty and 
3
gender inequality, mitigate disasters, and promote 
4
free speech, democracy, and good governance; 
5
(2) promote build-once policies and approaches 
6
and the multi-stakeholder approach to Internet gov-
7
ernance; and 
8
(3) ensure the effective use of United States 
9
foreign assistance resources toward that end.

SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
11
Congress makes the following findings: 
12
(1) Internet access has been a driver of eco-
13
nomic activity around the world. Bringing Internet 
14
access to the more than 4,000,000,000 people who 
15
do not have it could increase global economic output 
16
by $6,700,000,000,000 and raise 500,000,000 peo-
17
ple out of poverty. 
18
(2) The number of Internet users has more 
19
than 
tripled 
from 
1,000,000,000 
to 
over 
20
3,000,000,000 since 2005, including 2,000,000,000 
21
living in the developing world, yet more than half of 
22
the world’s population remains offline, living without 
23
the economic and social benefits of the Internet. By 
24
the end of 2016, over 80 percent of households in 
25
21:36 Mar 05, 2019
H1359
3 
•HR 1359 IH
the developed world had Internet access, compared 
1
with just 40 percent of households in developing 
2
countries and just 11 percent in the world’s least de-
3
veloped countries. Of the world’s offline population, 
4
an estimated 75 percent live in just 20 countries, 
5
and rural, female, elderly, illiterate, and low-income 
6
populations are being left behind. 
7
(3) Studies suggest that women are dispropor-
8
tionately affected by a digital gap in developing 
9
countries, where there are on average 23 percent 
10
fewer women online then men. Bringing an addi-
11
tional 600,000,000 women online could contribute 
12
$13,000,000,000 to $18,000,000,000 to annual 
13
GDP across 144 developing countries. 
14
(4) The United States has been a leader in pro-
15
moting access to an open, secure, interoperable 
16
Internet around the world. Recognizing that support 
17
for expanded Internet access furthers United States 
18
economic and foreign policy interests, including ef-
19
forts to end extreme global poverty and enabling re-
20
silient, democratic societies, the Department of State 
21
launched a diplomatic effort called ‘‘Global Con-
22
nect’’. 
23
(5) Internet access in developing countries is 
24
hampered, in part, by a lack of infrastructure and 
25
21:36 Mar 05, 2019

•HR 1359 IH
a poor regulatory environment for investment. Build- 
1
once policies and approaches, which seek to coordi-
2
nate public and private sector investments in roads 
3
and other critical infrastructure, can reduce the 
4
number and scale of excavation and construction ac-
5
tivities when installing telecommunications infra-
6
structure in rights-of-way, thereby reducing installa-
7
tion costs for high-speed Internet networks and serv-
8
ing as a development best practice.
