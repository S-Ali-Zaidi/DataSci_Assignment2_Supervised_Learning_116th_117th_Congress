SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
5
Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) Prostate cancer is the second leading cause 
7
of cancer death in men in the United States with 1 
8
in 41 men dying from prostate cancer and more 
9
than 31,600 men estimated to die from prostate 
10
cancer in 2019. 
11
(2) Prostate cancer is the second most com-
12
monly diagnosed cancer in the Nation with 1 in 9 
13
men being diagnosed in their lifetimes, 3.1 million 
14
men in the United States living with a diagnosis, 
15
and over 174,000 men estimated to be diagnosed in 
16
2019. 
17
(3) The survival rate for prostate cancer diag-
18
nosed in early stage is near 100 percent but prostate 
19
cancer diagnosed in late stage has only a 30-percent 
20
survival rate. 
21
(4) There are few, if any, symptoms of prostate 
22
cancer before it reaches late stage. 
23
(5) African-American men have a disproportion-
24
ately higher rate of prostate cancer and are 70 per-
25
cent more likely to be diagnosed with prostate can-
26

•HR 5200 IH
cer than White men, with 1 in 6 African-American 
1
men developing prostate cancer in their lifetimes. 
2
(6) African-American men are 2.3 times more 
3
likely to die from prostate cancer than White men. 
4
(7) Men with a father or brother with prostate 
5
cancer are more than twice as likely to be diagnosed 
6
with prostate cancer than men without a family his-
7
tory. 
8
(8) The common clinical definition for men at 
9
high-risk of prostate cancer includes African-Amer-
10
ican men and men with a family history. 
11
(9) Most of the major cancer and urological so-
12
cieties recommend beginning screening discussions 
13
earlier for African-American men and those with a 
14
family history of prostate cancer. 
15
(10) The United States Preventive Services 
16
Task Force has encouraged research on screening 
17
African-American men, including whether to screen 
18
African-American men at younger ages, and has 
19
identified this research as a high-priority cancer re-
20
search gap. 
21
(11) Barriers to screening should be minimized 
22
for high-risk men in order to catch asymptomatic 
23
prostate cancer before it metastasizes and the sur-
24
vival rate is dramatically reduced.

(12) The cost of treating metastatic prostate 
1
cancer in the United States health care system is 
2
hundreds of millions of dollars more annually than 
3
the cost of treating localized, early-stage cancer.
