the United States are the driving force behind the econ-
omy of the Nation, representing 99.9 percent of all busi-
nesses with employees in the United States;

ees in the private sector in America and are responsible

ing the economy of the Nation;

terests of small businesses; to ensure that a fair propor-
tion of the total purchases, contracts, and subcontracts 
for property and services for the Federal Government are 
placed with small businesses; to make certain access to 
critical capital is made available to such small businesses; 
and to maintain and strengthen the overall economy; 
Whereas the Small Business Administration has helped small 
businesses with access to critical lending opportunities, 
played a key role in ensuring full and open competition 
for government contracts, and improved the economic en-
vironment in which small business concerns compete; and

Business Week’’: Now, therefore, be it
