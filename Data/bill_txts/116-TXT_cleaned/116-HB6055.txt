Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

graphical barriers for inmates hoping to stay in 
1
touch with their families or members of their com-
2
munity may help lower recidivism rates. These con-
3
tinued relationships alleviate the risk of challenges 
4
such as unemployment, homelessness, and debt upon 
5
release. 
6
(2) In a study of inmates jailed close to home, 
7
the Vera Institute of Justice found that most par-
8
ticipants rely on family support to stay off of drugs 
9
and maintain requirements of parole as well as care 
10
for children. 
11
(3) According to the Vera study, more than 80 
12
percent of jailed respondents rely on family for sup-
13
port and more than 70 percent rely on friends. Even 
14
while incarcerated, inmates continue to rely heavily 
15
on their family and community outside of prison for 
16
basic needs and survival. 
17
(4) Family members report that distance is the 
18
greatest barrier to visiting incarcerated relatives 
19
while costs, such as transportation, follows. By re-
20
moving geographical and cost barriers, family mem-
21
bers of the incarcerated may have an opportunity to 
22
maintain a relationship with their incarcerated loved 
23
one.

(5) Incarcerated persons should be afforded op-
1
portunities to change and heal. Strengthening rela-
2
tionships between inmates and the family and com-
3
munity members they have left behind will help de-
4
crease recidivism rates and heal fragmented familial 
5
and community relationships.

10
ability, the Director shall place a prisoner in a residential 
11
reentry center that is within 50 miles of the prisoner’s 
12
previous or anticipated permanent legal address, except 
13
when the prisoner waives his right to be placed in such 
14
a center for reasons such as— 
15
‘‘(A) safety of the prisoner or his family; 
16
‘‘(B) physical or mental health; or 
17
‘‘(C) any other reason deemed to be ac-
18
ceptable by the Director.’’.
