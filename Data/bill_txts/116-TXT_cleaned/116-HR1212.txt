Whereas athletic administrators fulfill professional respon-
sibilities with honesty, integrity, commitment to equity, 
and fairness; 
Whereas athletic administrators preserve, enhance, and pro-
mote the educational values of athletics in our schools 
through professional growth in the areas of education,

ethics, sportsmanship, and personal conduct, and encour-
age coaching staffs, student-athletes, and community 
members to commit to these high standards as well;
