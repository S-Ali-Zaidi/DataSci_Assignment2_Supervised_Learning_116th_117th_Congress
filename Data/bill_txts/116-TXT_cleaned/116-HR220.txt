RESOLUTION 
Recognizing the interdependence of diplomacy, development, 
and defense as critical to effective national security. 
Whereas there has long been a strong bipartisan consensus 
that diplomacy, development, and defense are key pillars 
of an effective national security strategy; 
Whereas former Secretary of Defense James Mattis testified 
before Congress that ‘‘If you don’t fund the State De-
partment fully, then I need to buy more ammunition . . . 
.’’; 
Whereas President Barack Obama’s first National Security 
Strategy affirmed that ‘‘Our Armed Forces will always be 
a cornerstone of our security, but they must be com-
plemented. Our security also depends upon diplomats 
who can act in every corner of the world . . . .’’;

Whereas President George W. Bush, in his first National Se-
curity Strategy, recognized the interdependent relation-
ship between development, diplomacy, and defense as 
critical to advancing United States national security in-
terests; 
Whereas the Department of State and its employees are ex-
tremely effective in resolving international disputes 
through diplomacy, thus precluding the need for the use 
of Armed Forces and saving American lives and taxpayer 
dollars; 
Whereas the United States Agency for International Develop-
ment and its employees lead efforts that help countries 
and communities progress from crisis and poverty to sta-
bility and opportunity, creating a stronger, safer world 
that is ultimately less dependent on aid; 
Whereas in an April 21, 2010, letter to Congress, former 
Secretary of Defense Robert Gates wrote that ‘‘The work 
performed by diplomatic and development professionals 
helps build the foundation for more stable, democratic 
and prosperous societies. These are places where the po-
tential for conflict can be minimized, if not completely 
avoided, by State and USAID programs—thereby low-
ering the likely need for deployment of U.S. military as-
sets.’’; 
Whereas for between just one and one-and-a-half percent of 
the total Federal budget, the United States International 
Affairs Budget supports all United States diplomacy and 
development objectives, which advance United States na-
tional security interests at home and abroad;

Whereas diplomacy and development programs are critical 
tools in supporting key strategic allies like Israel and 
Jordan; 
Whereas the Department of State and the United States 
Agency for International Development are critical part-
ners in conflict mitigation, addressing some of the root 
causes of state failure and terrorism in order to prevent 
conflict before it starts; 
Whereas global health programs funded through the United 
States International Affairs Budget work to fight infec-
tious diseases and prevent deadly pandemics from reach-
ing America’s shores; 
Whereas humanitarian assistance programs funded through 
the United States International Affairs Budget assist vul-
nerable populations and help respond to humanitarian 
emergencies, such as famine and the growing numbers of 
displaced people worldwide; 
Whereas United States development and diplomacy programs 
promote America’s economic interests and help support 
jobs here at home by building and opening new markets 
for United States exports, attracting investment to the 
United States, and helping American companies and 
workers to compete globally on a level playing field; 
Whereas bipartisan support in Congress has resulted in sig-
nificant foreign assistance reform, ensuring more trans-
parent, accountable, and results-driven programs; and 
Whereas Members of Congress have built a bipartisan legacy 
of support for United States diplomacy and a strong and 
effective International Affairs Budget: Now, therefore, be 
it 
Resolved, That the House of Representatives—
