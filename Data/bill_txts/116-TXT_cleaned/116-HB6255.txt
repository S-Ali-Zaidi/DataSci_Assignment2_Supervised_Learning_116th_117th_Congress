SECTION 1. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA NATIONAL GUARD

EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM.

The Act entitled ‘‘An Act to provide for the organiza-
3
tion of the militia of the District of Columbia’’, approved 
4
March 1, 1889 (sec. 49–101 et seq., D.C. Official Code) 
5
is amended by adding at the end the following new title:

‘‘TITLE II—EDUCATIONAL

ASSISTANCE PROGRAM 
8
‘‘SEC. 201. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS. 
9
‘‘(a) SHORT TITLE.—This title may be cited as the 
10
‘Major General David F. Wherley, Jr. District of Colum-
11
bia National Guard Retention and College Access Act’. 
12
‘‘(b) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following find-
13
ings: 
14
‘‘(1) The District of Columbia National Guard 
15
is under the exclusive jurisdiction of the President of 
16
the United States as Commander-in-Chief and, un-
17
like other National Guards, is permanently federal-
18
ized. 
19
‘‘(2) The District of Columbia National Guard 
20
is unique and differs from the National Guards of 
21
the several States in that the District of Columbia 
22
National Guard is responsible, not only for residents 
23
of the District of Columbia, but also for a special 
24
and unique mission and obligation as a result of the 
25
00:38 Mar 27, 2020
H6255
3 
•HR 6255 IH
extensive presence of the Federal Government in the 
1
District of Columbia. 
2
‘‘(3) Consequently, the President of the United 
3
States, rather than the chief executive of the Dis-
4
trict of Columbia, is in command of the District of 
5
Columbia National Guard, and only the President 
6
can call up the District of Columbia National Guard 
7
even for local emergencies. 
8
‘‘(4) The District of Columbia National Guard 
9
has been specifically trained to address the unique 
10
emergencies that may occur regarding the presence 
11
of the Federal Government in the District of Colum-
12
bia. 
13
‘‘(5) The great majority of the members of the 
14
District of Columbia National Guard actually live in 
15
Maryland or Virginia, rather than in the District of 
16
Columbia. 
17
‘‘(6) The District of Columbia National Guard 
18
has been experiencing a disproportionate decline in 
19
force in comparison to the National Guards of Mary-
20
land and Virginia. 
21
‘‘(7) The States of Maryland and Virginia pro-
22
vide additional recruiting and retention incentives, 
23
such as educational benefits, in order to maintain 
24
their force, and their National Guards have drawn 
25
00:38 Mar 27, 2020
H6255
4 
•HR 6255 IH
recruits from the District of Columbia at a rate that 
1
puts at risk the maintenance of the necessary force 
2
levels for the District of Columbia National Guard. 
3
‘‘(8) Funds for an educational benefit for mem-
4
bers of the District of Columbia National Guard 
5
would provide an incentive to help reverse the loss 
6
of members to nearby National Guards and allow for 
7
maintenance and increase of necessary District of 
8
Columbia National Guard personnel. 
9
‘‘(9) The loss of members of the District of Co-
10
lumbia National Guard could adversely affect the 
11
readiness of the District of Columbia National 
12
Guard to respond in the event of a terrorist attack 
13
on the capital of the United States.
