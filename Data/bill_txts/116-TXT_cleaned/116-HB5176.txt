1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
1
Congress finds the following: 
2
(1) Every region of the United States is con-
3
fronting the effects of climate change and related 
4
natural disasters, including extreme heat and 
5
droughts, heavy rains and flooding, hurricanes and 
6
tornadoes, acidification of the oceans and sea level 
7
rise, wildfires, and mudslides, among other effects. 
8
(2) These changes affect the health, agriculture, 
9
food supply, infrastructure, energy supply, water 
10
quality and water supply, and have the potential to 
11
reduce the standard of living and quality of life in 
12
the United States. 
13
(3) The Fourth National Climate Assessment 
14
estimates that low-income communities will be dis-
15
proportionately impacted by climate change through 
16
higher rates of adverse health conditions, greater ex-
17
posure to environmental hazards, and more severe 
18
impacts and longer recovery from natural disasters. 
19
(4) The Fourth National Climate Assessment 
20
estimates that— 
21
(A) climate change will shrink the Amer-
22
ican economy by up to 10 percent by the year 
23
2100 
and 
will 
result 
in 
losses 
up 
to 
24
$141,000,000,000 from heat-related deaths, 
25
$118,000,000,000 from sea level rise, and 
26

•HR 5176 IH
$32,000,000,000 from infrastructure damage; 
1
and 
2
(B) proactive adaptation initiatives yield 
3
benefits in excess of their costs in both the near 
4
term and long term. 
5
(5) The frequency and severity of natural disas-
6
ters taking place each year is steadily and signifi-
7
cantly increasing. In 1970, there were 78 registered 
8
natural disasters. In 2017, there were 335 natural 
9
disasters, impacting approximately 96,000,000 peo-
10
ple and costing the United States more than 
11
$306,000,000,000. 
12
(6) Service and Conservation Corps, which are 
13
descended from the Civilian Conservation Corps of 
14
the 1930s, are trained for and have experience with 
15
the four stages of disaster: mitigation, preparedness, 
16
response, and recovery.
