A BILL 
To amend title 10, United States Code, to ensure that mem-
bers of the Armed Forces and their families have access 
to the contraception they need in order to promote the 
health and readiness of all members of the Armed 
Forces, and for other purposes. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
1
tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
1
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Access to Contracep-
2
tion for Servicemembers and Dependents Act of 2019’’.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
4
Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) Women are serving in the Armed Forces at 
6
increasing rates, playing a critical role in the na-
7
tional security of the United States. Women com-
8
prise more than 17 percent of members of the 
9
Armed Forces, and as of 2018 nearly 350,000 
10
women serve on active duty in the Armed Forces or 
11
in the Selected Reserve. 
12
(2) Ninety-five percent of women serving in the 
13
Armed Forces are of reproductive age. And as of 
14
2017, more than 700,000 female spouses and de-
15
pendents of active duty members are of reproductive 
16
age. 
17
(3) The TRICARE program covered 1,563,727 
18
women of reproductive age in 2017, including female 
19
spouses and dependents of active duty members. 
20
(4) The benefits of contraception are widely rec-
21
ognized and include improved health and well-being, 
22
reduced global maternal mortality, health benefits of 
23
pregnancy spacing for maternal and child health, 
24
and women’s greater educational and professional 
25
opportunities and increased lifetime earnings.

•HR 2091 IH
(5) Studies have shown that when cost barriers 
1
to the full range of methods of contraception are 
2
eliminated, and women receive comprehensive coun-
3
seling on the various methods of contraception (in-
4
cluding highly effective and more expensive long-act-
5
ing reversible contraceptives), rates of unintended 
6
pregnancy decline. 
7
(6) Research has also shown that investments 
8
in effective contraception save public and private 
9
dollars. 
10
(7) In order to fill gaps in coverage and access 
11
to preventive care critical for women’s health, the 
12
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public 
13
Law 111–148) requires all non-grandfathered indi-
14
vidual and group health plans to cover without cost- 
15
sharing preventive services, including a set of evi-
16
dence-based preventive services for women supported 
17
by the Health Resources and Services Administra-
18
tion of the Department of Health and Human Serv-
19
ices. These women’s preventive services include the 
20
full range of female-controlled contraceptive meth-
21
ods, effective family planning practices, and steriliza-
22
tion procedures, approved by the Food and Drug 
23
Administration. The Health Resources and Services 
24
Administration has affirmed that contraceptive care 
25
03:17 Apr 16, 2019
H2091

•HR 2091 IH
includes contraceptive counseling, initiation of con-
1
traceptive use, and follow-up care (such as manage-
2
ment, evaluation, and changes to and removal or dis-
3
continuation of the contraceptive method). 
4
(8) Under the TRICARE program, women 
5
members on active duty have full coverage of all pre-
6
scription drugs, including contraception, without 
7
cost-sharing requirements, in line with the Patient 
8
Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law 
9
111–148), which requires coverage of all contracep-
10
tive methods approved by the Food and Drug Ad-
11
ministration for women and related services and 
12
education and counseling. However, women members 
13
not on active duty and female dependents of mem-
14
bers do not have similar coverage of all prescription 
15
methods of contraception approved by the Food and 
16
Drug Administration without cost-sharing when they 
17
fill their prescriptions outside of a military medical 
18
treatment facility. 
19
(9) Studies indicate that women members need 
20
comprehensive counseling for pregnancy prevention 
21
and the lack thereof is contributing to unintended 
22
pregnancies among women members. Additionally, 
23
they need counseling on and availability of contra-
24
ception for non-contraceptive benefits (for example, 
25

•HR 2091 IH
menstrual suppression and predictable menstrual 
1
patterns) which is important in ensuring readiness 
2
for deployment to remote or operational theaters. 
3
(10) Research studies based on the Department 
4
of Defense Survey of Health Related Behaviors 
5
Among Active Duty Military Personnel found a high 
6
rate of unintended pregnancy among women mem-
7
bers. Adjusting for the difference between age dis-
8
tributions in the Armed Forces and the general pop-
9
ulation, the rate of unintended pregnancy among 
10
women members is higher than among the general 
11
population. 
12
(11) The Defense Advisory Committee on 
13
Women in the Services has recommended that all 
14
the Armed Forces, to the extent that they have not 
15
already, implement initiatives that inform members 
16
of the importance of family planning, educate them 
17
on methods of contraception, and make various 
18
methods of contraception available, based on the 
19
finding that family planning can increase the overall 
20
readiness and quality of life of all members of the 
21
military. 
22
(12) The military departments received more 
23
than 6,700 reports of sexual assaults involving mem-
24
bers as victims or subjects during fiscal year 2017.

•HR 2091 IH
Through regulations, the Department of Defense al-
1
ready supports a policy of ensuring that women

members who are sexually assaulted have access to 
3
emergency contraception, and the initiation of con-
4
traception if desired and medically appropriate.
