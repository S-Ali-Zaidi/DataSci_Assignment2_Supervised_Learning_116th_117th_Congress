•HR 6115 IH
(1) In October, 2016, the Comptroller General 
1
of the United States released a report detailing ef-
2
forts of the Department of Defense to establish pro-
3
grams to assist members of the Armed Forces in ob-
4
taining information on professional credentials re-
5
lated to their military occupational specialties so the 
6
members may find employment after separating 
7
from the Armed Forces. 
8
(2) In such report, the Comptroller General 
9
found that the Department of Defense failed to de-
10
velop performance measures to gauge the effective-
11
ness of such programs. 
12
(3) The Secretary of Defense did not concur 
13
with the recommendation of the Comptroller General 
14
to develop and implement performance measures for 
15
the programs. 
16
(4) Since the release of such report, the Sec-
17
retary has sought to improve opportunities for mem-
18
bers of the Armed Forces to obtain professional cre-
19
dentials by establishing performance goals, such as 
20
the integration of relevant policy of the Department 
21
of Defense into the career investment portfolio con-
22
cept, and the implementation and integration of cer-
23
tain programs into the Service Member Outcomes 
24
Portal.

ployers, education officials, and Members of Con-
