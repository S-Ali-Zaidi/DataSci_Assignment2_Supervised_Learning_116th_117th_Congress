(1) The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) 
1
has determined that certain foreign actors pose a se-
2
rious threat to the telecommunications supply chain. 
3
(2) Through cyber espionage and other delib-
4
erate acts, billions of dollars in trade secrets, intel-
5
lectual property, and technology are stolen each year 
6
from the Federal Government, corporations, and 
7
academic institutions. 
8
(3) The People’s Republic of China (China) is 
9
one of the two largest participants in cyber espio-
10
nage. 
11
(4) A 2012 report by the Permanent Select 
12
Committee on Intelligence of the House of Rep-
13
resentatives found that China exerts cyber espionage 
14
capabilities through telecommunications components 
15
and systems marketed directly to businesses and 
16
other entities in the United States. 
17
(5) A 2018 report by the Office of the United 
18
States Trade Representative found that Chinese gov-
19
ernment-owned entities were responsible for a sub-
20
stantial number of patent infringements.

shell companies to subvert the export control laws of 
1
the United States, explicitly stating that ‘‘[t]he big-
2
gest advantage of [this model] is that it is more ef-
3
fective, [because it’s] harder for the U.S. Govern-
4
ment to trace it or investigate the real flow of the 
5
controlled commodities.’’. 
6
(7) United States businesses provide an esti-
7
mated 25 to 30 percent of the components used in 
8
products of ZTE Corporation, including smart-
9
phones. 
10
(8) The FBI determined that ZTE Corporation 
11
sold banned technology to Iran and used the meth-
12
ods discussed in paragraph (6) to mask its trans-
13
action history in an effort to undermine investiga-
14
tions of the Department of Commerce. 
15
(9) Since 2008, ZTE Corporation has been the 
16
defendant, counterclaimant, or respondent in 722 
17
court actions. 
18
(10) On March 23, 2017, the Department of 
19
Justice stated that ‘‘ZTE Corporation has agreed to 
20
enter a guilty plea and to pay a $430,488,798 pen-
21
alty to the United States for conspiring to violate 
22
the International Emergency Economic Powers Act

by illegally shipping U.S.-origin items to Iran, ob-

structing justice and making a material false state-

(11) ZTE Corporation has also previously 
3
reached settlement agreements with the Bureau of 
4
Industry and Security of the Department of Com-
5
merce and the Office of Foreign Assets Control of 
6
the Department of the Treasury. 
7
(12) The Bureau of Industry and Security sub-
8
sequently found ZTE Corporation in violation of the 
9
settlement agreement with the Bureau due to— 
10
(A) falsification of reports and correspond-
11
ence with the Bureau; and 
12
(B) failure to discipline all individuals 
13
named in the settlement agreement. 
14
(13) On March 13, 2018, the Bureau of Indus-
15
try and Security notified ZTE Corporation that the 
16
agency would activate a conditionally suspended de-
17
nial order, due to the determination by the agency 
18
that ZTE Corporation had continuously made false 
19
statements to the United States Government. 
20
(14) On June 7, 2018, Secretary of Commerce 
21
Wilbur Ross announced that ZTE Corporation— 
22
(A) agreed to additional penalties and com-
23
pliance measures which would supplant a prior 
24
order of the Bureau; and

ment of Commerce’s Denied Persons List, a list

of individuals and entities that have been de-

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
5
It is the sense of Congress that— 
6
(1) ZTE Corporation poses a significant risk to 
7
the economy and national security of the United 
8
States; and 
9
(2) ZTE Corporation engages and will continue 
10
to engage in the theft of intellectual property to the 
11
detriment of businesses in the United States.
