Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
3
Congress finds the following: 
4
(1) Foreign governments have increasingly 
5
sought to extraterritorially intimidate American and 
6
non-American companies into policing media content 
7
and the free speech rights of staff, employees, and 
8
other associated persons. 
9
(2) Because the extraterritorial advocacy for 
10
human rights abroad is a core tenet of American 
11
foreign policy and central to American national secu-
12
rity, the growing extraterritorial suppression of 
13
speech of persons and companies represents a long- 
14
term threat to American interests. 
15
(3) Self-censorship by American companies and 
16
other nongovernmental entities in accordance with 
17
the stated or unstated wishes of foreign geopolitical 
18
rivals will only encourage more of the same. 
19
(4) While China’s economic weight affords it 
20
unique leverage to seek to compel corporate self-cen-
21
sorship or retaliation against staff expressing con-
22
trary views, including the manager of a basketball 
23
team expressing support for human rights, other 
24
countries such as North Korea have also sought to

stifle free speech through malign measures, includ-
1
ing conducting cyberattacks against a motion picture 
2
studio that distributed comedic content regarding its 
3
leadership. 
4
(5) The United States Congress not only de-
5
fends, but encourages, American persons and per-
6
sons within the United States to be outspoken de-
7
fenders of the rights of those around the world 
8
standing up against repression and persecution.

19
ployment or contract, on the basis of protected activ-
20
ity, in the case that such an adverse action was un-

action, or the domestic entity presumes that a 
1
designated foreign authority would prefer such 
2
an adverse action; 
3
(B) because the protected activity resulted 
4
in, or has the potential to result in— 
5
(i) financial, reputational, or other 
6
damage to the domestic entity’s profit-
7
ability or organizational prospects in a 
8
country governed by a designated foreign 
9
authority with which the protected activity 
10
relates; or 
11
(ii) economic retaliation by such coun-

action against any such employee or contractor with 
20
respect to his or her compensation, terms, condi-
21
tions, or privileges of employment or contract, on the 
22
basis of such employee or contractor’s actual or con-
23
templated assertion of any protection under this Act,

(B) a reasonable person, considering the 
7
context or content of the protected activity, 
8
would believe such activity was conducted in 
9
such employee or contractor’s official employ-
10
ment or contractual capacity, and such activity, 
11
if conducted in an official capacity, would have 
12
been contrary to an official policy or the finan-
13
cial or organizational interests of the domestic 
14
entity; or 
15
(C) the protected activity occurred— 
16
(i) in the territory of a country gov-
17
erned by a designated foreign authority

9
lege related to such employment or contract, a prospective, 
10
existing, or former employee or contractor to— 
11
(1) limit a protected activity conducted in an

14
tion on retaliation described in subsection (a); or 
15
(2) waive or abridge any right or cause of ac-
16
tion under this Act, including requiring an employee
