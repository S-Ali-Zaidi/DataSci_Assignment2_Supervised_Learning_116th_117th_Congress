ACT. 
6
Congress finds the following: 
7
(1) The right to vote for all Americans is sac-
8
rosanct and rules for voting and election administra-
9
tion should protect the right to vote and promote 
10
voter participation. 
11
(2) The Voting Rights Act has empowered the 
12
Department of Justice and Federal courts for nearly 
13
a half a century to block discriminatory voting prac-
14
tices before their implementation in States and local-
15
ities with the most troubling histories and ongoing 
16
records of racial discrimination. 
17
(3) There continues to be an alarming move-
18
ment to erect barriers to make it more difficult for 
19
Americans to participate in our Nation’s democratic 
20
process. The Nation has witnessed unprecedented ef-
21
forts to turn back the clock and erect barriers to 
22
voting for communities of color which have faced 
23
historic and continuing discrimination, as well as 
24
disabled, young, elderly, and low-income Americans.

(4) The Supreme Court’s 2013 Shelby County 
1
v. Holder decision gutted decades-long Federal pro-
2
tections for communities of color that face historic 
3
and continuing discrimination, emboldening States 
4
and local jurisdictions to pass voter suppression laws 
5
and implement procedures, such as those requiring 
6
photo identification, limiting early voting hours, 
7
eliminating same-day registration, purging voters 
8
from the rolls, and reducing the number of polling 
9
places. Congress is committed to reversing the dev-
10
astating impact of this decision. 
11
(5) Racial discrimination in voting is a clear 
12
and persistent problem. The actions of States and 
13
localities around the country post-Shelby County, in-
14
cluding at least 10 findings by Federal courts of in-
15
tentional discrimination, underscore the need for 
16
Congress to conduct investigatory and evidentiary 
17
hearings to determine the legislation necessary to re-
18
store the Voting Rights Act and combat continuing 
19
efforts in America that suppress the free exercise of 
20
the franchise in communities of color.

22
evidence that systemic voter discrimination and in-
23
timidation continues to occur in communities of 
24
color across the country, making it clear that democ-

1
stores key provisions of the Voting Rights Act.

every eligible citizen’s right to vote. Congress should 
4
respond by modernizing the electoral system to— 
5
(A) improve access to the ballot;

(B) enhance the integrity and security of 
7
our voting systems; 
8
(C) ensure greater accountability for the 
9
administration of elections; and 
10
(D) restore protections for voters against 
11
practices in States and localities plagued by the 
12
persistence of voter disenfranchisement; and 
13
(E) ensure that Federal civil rights laws 
14
protect the rights of voters against discrimina-

4
tion’s four-State survey of voter discrimination 
5
(2016) and nine field hearings in Indian Country 
6
(2017–2018) revealed obstacles that Native Ameri-
7
cans must overcome, including a lack of accessible 
8
and proximate registration and polling sites, non-
9
traditional addresses for residents on Indian reserva-
10
tions, inadequate language assistance for Tribal 
11
members, and voter identification laws that discrimi-
12
nate against Native Americans. The Department of 
13
Justice and courts have recognized that some juris-
14
dictions have been unresponsive to reasonable re-
15
quests from federally recognized Indian Tribes for 
16
more accessible and proximate voter registration 
17
sites and in-person voting locations. 
18
(3) The 2018 elections provide further evidence 
19
that systemic voter discrimination and intimidation 
20
continues to occur in communities of color and Trib-

MINING OUR DEMOCRACY.

Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) Criminals, terrorists, and corrupt govern-
7
ment officials frequently abuse anonymously held 
8
limited liability companies (LLCs), also known as 
9
‘‘shell companies,’’ to hide, move, and launder the 
10
dirty money derived from illicit activities such as 
11
trafficking, bribery, exploitation, and embezzlement. 
12
Ownership and control of the finances that run 
13
through shell companies are obscured to regulators 
14
and law enforcement because little information is re-
15
quired and collected when establishing these entities. 
16
(2) The public release of the ‘‘Panama Papers’’ 
17
in 2016 and the ‘‘Paradise Papers’’ in 2017 revealed 
18
that these shell companies often purchase and sell 
19
United States real estate. United States anti-money 
20
laundering laws do not apply to cash transactions in-
21
volving real estate effectively concealing the bene-
22
ficiaries and transactions from regulators and law 
23
enforcement.

•HR 1 IH
(3) Congress should curb the use of anonymous 
1
shell companies for illicit purposes by requiring 
2
United States companies to disclose their beneficial 
3
owners, strengthening anti-money laundering and 
4
counter-terrorism finance laws. 
5
(4) Congress should examine the money laun-
6
dering and terrorist financing risks in the real estate 
7
market, including the role of anonymous parties, and 
8
review legislation to address any vulnerabilities iden-
9
tified in this sector. 
10
(5) Congress should examine the methods by 
11
which corruption flourishes and the means to detect 
12
and deter the financial misconduct that fuels this 
13
driver of global instability. Congress should monitor 
14
government efforts to enforce United States anti- 
15
corruption laws and regulations.

18
(1) On January 6, 2017, the Office of the Di-
19
rector of National Intelligence published a report ti-
20
tled ‘‘Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in 
21
Recent U.S. Elections’’, noting that ‘‘Russian Presi-

messaging strategy that blends covert intelligence 
1
operation—such as cyber activity—with overt efforts 
2
by Russian Government agencies, state-funded 
3
media, third-party intermediaries, and paid social 
4
media users or ‘‘trolls’’. 
5
(2) On November 24, 2016, The Washington 
6
Post reported findings from 2 teams of independent 
7
researchers that concluded Russians ‘‘exploited 
8
American-made technology platforms to attack U.S. 
9
democracy at a particularly vulnerable moment . . . 
10
as part of a broadly effective strategy of sowing dis-
11
trust in U.S. democracy and its leaders.’’. 
12
(3) Findings from a 2017 study on the manipu-
13
lation of public opinion through social media con-
14
ducted by the Computational Propaganda Research 
15
Project at the Oxford Internet Institute found that 
16
the Kremlin is using pro-Russian bots to manipulate 
17
public discourse to a highly targeted audience. With 
18
a sample of nearly 1,300,000 tweets, researchers 
19
found that in the 2016 election’s 3 decisive States, 
20
propaganda constituted 40 percent of the sampled 
21
election-related tweets that went to Pennsylvanians, 
22
34 percent to Michigan voters, and 30 percent to 
23
those in Wisconsin. In other swing States, the figure 
24
reached 42 percent in Missouri, 41 percent in Flor-

ida, 40 percent in North Carolina, 38 percent in 
1
Colorado, and 35 percent in Ohio.

(4) On September 6, 2017, the nation’s largest 
3
social media platform disclosed that between June 
4
2015 and May 2017, Russian entities purchased 
5
$100,000 in political advertisements, publishing 
6
roughly 3,000 ads linked to fake accounts associated 
7
with the Internet Research Agency, a pro-Kremlin 
8
organization. According to the company, the ads 
9
purchased focused ‘‘on amplifying divisive social and 
10
political messages . . .’’. 
11
(5) In 2002, the Bipartisan Campaign Reform 
12
Act became law, establishing disclosure requirements 
13
for political advertisements distributed from a tele-
14
vision or radio broadcast station or provider of cable 
15
or satellite television. In 2003, the Supreme Court 
16
upheld regulations on electioneering communications 
17
established under the Act, noting that such require-
18
ments ‘‘provide the electorate with information and 
19
insure that the voters are fully informed about the 
20
person or group who is speaking.’’. 
21
(6) According to a study from Borrell Associ-
22
ates, in 2016, $1,415,000,000 was spent on online 
23
advertising, more than quadruple the amount in 
24
2012.

(7) The reach of a few large internet plat-
1
forms—larger than any broadcast, satellite, or cable 
2
provider—has greatly facilitated the scope and effec-
3
tiveness of disinformation campaigns. For instance, 
4
the largest platform has over 210,000,000 Ameri-
5
cans users—over 160,000,000 of them on a daily 
6
basis. By contrast, the largest cable television pro-
7
vider has 22,430,000 subscribers, while the largest 
8
satellite television provider has 21,000,000 sub-
9
scribers. And the most-watched television broadcast 
10
in United States history had 118,000,000 viewers. 
11
(8) The public nature of broadcast television, 
12
radio, and satellite ensures a level of publicity for 
13
any political advertisement. These communications 
14
are accessible to the press, fact-checkers, and polit-
15
ical opponents; this creates strong disincentives for 
16
a candidate to disseminate materially false, inflam-
17
matory, or contradictory messages to the public. So-
18
cial media platforms, in contrast, can target portions 
19
of the electorate with direct, ephemeral advertise-
20
ments often on the basis of private information the 
21
platform has on individuals, enabling political adver-
22
tisements that are contradictory, racially or socially 
23
inflammatory, or materially false.

6
while the disinformation tactics of foreign adver-

10
Keith B. Alexander (RET.), the former Director of 
11
the National Security Agency, testified, during the 
12
Cold War ‘‘if the Soviet Union sought to manipulate 
13
information flow, it would have to do so principally 
14
through its own propaganda outlets or through ac-
15
tive measures that would generate specific news: 
16
planting of leaflets, inciting of violence, creation of 
17
other false materials and narratives. But the news 
18
itself was hard to manipulate because it would have 
19
required actual control of the organs of media, which 
20
took long-term efforts to penetrate. Today, however, 
21
because the clear majority of the information on so-
22
cial media sites is uncurated and there is a rapid 
23
proliferation of information sources and other sites

that can reinforce information, there is an increasing

It is the sense of Congress that—

(1) the dramatic increase in digital political ad-

13
Congress and the Federal Election Commission to 
14
take meaningful action to ensure that laws and reg-
15
ulations provide the accountability and transparency 
16
that is fundamental to our democracy; 
17
(2) free and fair elections require both trans-
18
parency and accountability which give the public a 
19
right to know the true sources of funding for polit-

Citizens United Decision 
2
SEC. 5001. FINDINGS RELATING TO CITIZENS UNITED DECI-
3
SION. 
4
Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) The American Republic was founded on the 
6
principle that all people are created equal, with 
7
rights and responsibilities as citizens to vote, be rep-
8
resented, speak, debate, and participate in self-gov-
9
ernment on equal terms regardless of wealth. To se-
10
cure these rights and responsibilities, our Constitu-
11
tion not only protects the equal rights of all Ameri-
12
cans but also provides checks and balances to pre-
13
vent corruption and prevent concentrated power and 
14
wealth from undermining effective self-government. 
15
(2) The Supreme Court’s decisions in Citizens 
16
United v. Federal Election Commission, 558 U.S. 
17
21:47 Jan 22, 2019
H1
367 
•HR 1 IH
310 (2010) and McCutcheon v. FEC, 572 U.S. 185 
1
(2014), as well as other court decisions, erroneously 
2
invalidated even-handed rules about the spending of 
3
money in local, State, and Federal elections. These 
4
flawed decisions have empowered large corporations, 
5
extremely wealthy individuals, and special interests 
6
to dominate election spending, corrupt our politics, 
7
and degrade our democracy through tidal waves of 
8
unlimited and anonymous spending. These decisions 
9
also stand in contrast to a long history of efforts by 
10
Congress and the States to regulate money in poli-
11
tics to protect democracy, and they illustrate a trou-
12
bling deregulatory trend in campaign finance-related 
13
court decisions. Additionally, an unknown amount of 
14
foreign money continues to be spent in our political 
15
system as subsidiaries of foreign-based corporations 
16
and hostile foreign actors sometimes connected to 
17
nation-States work to influence our elections. 
18
(3) The Supreme Court’s misinterpretation of 
19
the Constitution to empower monied interests at the 
20
expense of the American people in elections has seri-
21
ously eroded over 100 years of congressional action 
22
to promote fairness and protect elections from the 
23
toxic influence of money.

(4) In 1907, Congress passed the Tillman Act 
1
in response to the concentration of corporate power 
2
in the post-Civil War Gilded Age. The Act prohibited 
3
corporations from making contributions in connec-
4
tion with Federal elections, aiming ‘‘not merely to 
5
prevent the subversion of the integrity of the elec-
6
toral process [but] . . . to sustain the active, alert 
7
responsibility of the individual citizen in a democ-
8
racy for the wise conduct of government’’. 
9
(5) By 1910, Congress began passing disclosure 
10
requirements and campaign expenditure limits, and 
11
dozens of States passed corrupt practices Acts to 
12
prohibit corporate spending in elections. States also 
13
enacted campaign spending limits, and some States 
14
limited the amount that people could contribute to 
15
campaigns. 
16
(6) In 1947, the Taft-Hartley Act prohibited 
17
corporations and unions from making campaign con-
18
tributions or other expenditures to influence elec-
19
tions. In 1962, a Presidential commission on election 
20
spending recommended spending limits and incen-
21
tives to increase small contributions from more peo-
22
ple. 
23
(7) The Federal Election Campaign Act of 
24
1971 (FECA), as amended in 1974, required disclo-

sure of contributions and expenditures, imposed con-
1
tribution and expenditure limits for individuals and 
2
groups, set spending limits for campaigns, can-
3
didates, and groups, implemented a public funding 
4
system for Presidential campaigns, and created the 
5
Federal Election Commission to oversee and enforce 
6
the new rules. 
7
(8) In the wake of Citizens United and other 
8
damaging Federal court decisions, Americans have 
9
witnessed an explosion of outside spending in elec-
10
tions. Outside spending increased nearly 900 percent 
11
between the 2008 and 2016 Presidential election 
12
years. Indeed, the 2018 elections once again made 
13
clear the overwhelming political power of wealthy 
14
special interests, to the tune of over $5,000,000,000. 
15
And as political entities adapt to a post-Citizens 
16
United, post-McCutcheon landscape, these trends 
17
are getting worse, as evidenced by the experience in 
18
the 2018 midterm congressional elections, where 
19
outside spending more than doubled from the pre-
20
vious midterm cycle. 
21
(9) The torrent of money flowing into our polit-
22
ical system has a profound effect on the democratic 
23
process for everyday Americans, whose voices and 
24
policy preferences are increasingly being drowned 
25

out by those of wealthy special interests. The more 
1
campaign cash from wealthy special interests can 
2
flood our elections, the more policies that favor those 
3
interests are reflected in the national political agen-
4
da. When it comes to policy preferences, our Na-
5
tion’s wealthiest tend to have fundamentally dif-
6
ferent views than do average Americans when it 
7
comes to issues ranging from unemployment benefits 
8
to the minimum wage to health care coverage. 
9
(10) The Court has tied the hands of Congress 
10
and the States, severely restricting them from set-
11
ting reasonable limits on campaign spending. For 
12
example, the Court has held that only the Govern-
13
ment’s interest in preventing quid pro quo corrup-
14
tion, like bribery, or the appearance of such corrup-
15
tion, can justify limits on campaign contributions. 
16
More broadly, the Court has severely curtailed at-
17
tempts to reduce the ability of the Nation’s wealthi-
18
est and most powerful to skew our democracy in 
19
their favor by buying outsized influence in our elec-
20
tions. Because this distortion of the Constitution has 
21
prevented truly meaningful regulation or reform of 
22
the way we finance elections in America, a constitu-
23
tional amendment is needed to achieve a democracy 
24
for all the people.

5

6
States and municipalities across the country that 
7
have placed amendment questions on the ballot have 
8
routinely supported these initiatives by considerably 
9
large margins.

(12) At the same time millions of Americans 
11
have signed petitions, marched, called their Members
