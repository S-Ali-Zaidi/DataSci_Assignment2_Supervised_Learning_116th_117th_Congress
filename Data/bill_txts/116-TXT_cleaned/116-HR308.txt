Whereas the Ryan White Part D Program is one of the na-
tional efforts to link HIV-positive youth to medical care 
and support services; 
Whereas the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act 
(PPACA) provides youth, including those at risk for and 
living with HIV/AIDS, better access to health care cov-
erage, more health insurance options, additional funding 
for sex education, a prohibition against denying people 
living with HIV access to health care, and expanded ac-
cess to Medicaid which will help more HIV-positive youth 
receive care; and
