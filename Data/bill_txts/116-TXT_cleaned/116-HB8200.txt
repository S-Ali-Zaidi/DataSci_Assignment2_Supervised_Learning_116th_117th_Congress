(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following find-
7
ings:

00:31 Nov 13, 2020
H8200
6 
•HR 8200 IH
(1) The World Health Organization (WHO) de-
1
clared COVID–19 a ‘‘Public Health Emergency of 
2
International Concern’’ on January 30, 2020. By 
3
late March 2020, there have been over 470,000 con-
4
firmed cases of, and 20,000 deaths associated with, 
5
COVID–19 worldwide. 
6
(2) In the United States, cases of COVID–19 
7
have quickly surpassed those across the world, and 
8
as of April 12, 2020, over 500,000 cases and 20,000 
9
deaths have been reported in the United States 
10
alone. 
11
(3) Early reporting on racial inequities in 
12
COVID–19 testing and treatment have renewed calls 
13
for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
14
and other relevant subagencies within the Depart-
15
ment of Health and Human Services to publicly re-
16
lease racial and demographic information to better 
17
inform the pandemic response, specifically in com-
18
munities of color and in Limited English Proficient 
19
(LEP) communities. 
20
(4) The burden of morbidity and mortality in 
21
the United States has historically fallen dispropor-
22
tionately on marginalized communities (those who 
23
suffer the most from great public health needs and 
24
are the most medically underserved). 
25
00:31 Nov 13, 2020
H8200

•HR 8200 IH
(5) Historically, structures and systems, such 
1
as racism, ableism and class oppression, have ren-
2
dered affected individuals more vulnerable to inequi-
3
ties and have prevented people from achieving their 
4
optimal health even when there is not a crisis of 
5
pandemic proportions. 
6
(6) Significant differences in access to health 
7
care, specifically to primary health care providers, 
8
health care information, and greater perceived dis-
9
crimination in health care place communities of 
10
color, individuals with disabilities, and LEP individ-
11
uals at greater risk of receiving delayed, and per-
12
haps poorer, health care. 
13
(7) Stark racial inequities across the United 
14
States, including unequal access to stable housing, 
15
quality education, and decent employment signifi-
16
cantly impact the ability of individuals to take care 
17
of their most basic health needs. Communities of 
18
color are more likely to experience homelessness and 
19
struggle with low-paying jobs or unemployment. To 
20
date, experts have cited that 2 in 5 Latino residents 
21
in New York City, the current epicenter of the 
22
COVID–19 pandemic, are recently unemployed as a 
23
direct consequence of COVID–19. And at a time 
24
when sheltering in place will save lives, less than 1

•HR 8200 IH
in 5 Black workers and roughly 1 in 6 Latino work-
1
ers are able to work from home. 
2
(8) Communities of color experience higher 
3
rates of chronic disease and disabilities, such as dia-
4
betes, hypertension, and asthma, than non-Hispanic 
5
White communities, which predisposes them to 
6
greater risk of complications and mortality should 
7
they contract COVID–19. 
8
(9) Such communities are made even more vul-
9
nerable to the uncertainty of the preparation, re-
10
sponse, and events surrounding the pandemic public 
11
health crisis, COVID–19. For instance, in the recent 
12
past, multiple epidemiologic studies and reviews have 
13
reported higher rates of hospitalization due to the 
14
2009 H1N1 pandemic among the poor, individuals 
15
with disabilities and preexisting conditions, those liv-
16
ing in impoverished neighborhoods, and individuals 
17
of color and ethnic backgrounds in the United 
18
States. These findings highlight the urgency to 
19
adapt the COVID–19 response to monitor and act 
20
on these inequities via data collection and research 
21
by race and ethnicity. 
22
(10) Research experts recognize that there are 
23
underlying differences in illness and death when 
24
each of these factors are examined through socio-
25
00:31 Nov 13, 2020
H8200

•HR 8200 IH
economic and racial or ethnic lenses. These socially 
1
determinant factors of health accelerate disease and 
2
degradation. 
3
(11) Language barriers are highly correlated 
4
with medication noncompliance and inconsistent en-
5
gagement with health systems. Without language ac-
6
cessibility data and research around COVID–19, 
7
these communities are less likely to receive critical 
8
testing and preventive health services. Yet, to date, 
9
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention do 
10
not disseminate COVID–19 messaging in critical 
11
languages, including Mandarin Chinese, Spanish, 
12
and Korean within the same timeframe as informa-
13
tion in English despite requirements to ensure lim-
14
ited English proficient populations are not discrimi-
15
nated against under title VI of the Civil Rights Act 
16
of 1964 and subsequent laws and Federal policies. 
17
(12) Further, it is critical to disaggregate data 
18
further by ancestry to address disparities among 
19
Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Is-
20
lander groups. According to the National Equity 
21
Atlas, while 13 percent of the Asian population over-
22
all lived in poverty in 2015, 39 percent of Burmese 
23
people, 29 percent of Hmong people, and 21 percent 
24
of Pacific Islanders lived in poverty. 
25

•HR 8200 IH
(13) Utilizing disaggregation of enrollment in 
1
Affordable Care Act-sponsored health insurance, the 
2
Asian and Pacific Islander American Health Forum 
3
found that prior to the passage of the Patient Pro-
4
tection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111– 
5
148), Korean Americans had a high uninsured rate 
6
of 23 percent, compared to just 12 percent for all 
7
Asian Americans. Developing targeted outreach ef-
8
forts assisted 1,000,000 people and resulted in a 56- 
9
percent decrease in the uninsured among the Asian, 
10
Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander population. 
11
Such efforts show that disaggregated data is essen-
12
tial to public health mobilizations efforts. 
13
(14) Without clear understanding of how 
14
COVID–19 impacts marginalized racial and ethnic 
15
communities, there will be exacerbated risk of en-
16
dangering the most historically vulnerable of our 
17
Nation. 
18
(15) The consequences of misunderstanding the 
19
racial and ethnic impact of COVID–19 expound be-
20
yond communities of color such that it would impact 
21
all. 
22
(16) Race and ethnicity are valuable research 
23
and practice variables when used and interpreted ap-
24
propriately. Health data collected on patients by

1
rect critical resources and inform risk communica-
2
tion development in languages and at appropriate 
3
health literacy levels, which resonate with historically 
4
vulnerable communities of color. 
5
(17) To date, there is no public standardized 
6
and comprehensive race and ethnicity data reposi-
7
tory of COVID–19 testing, hospitalizations, or mor-
8
tality. The inconsistency of data collection by Fed-
9
eral, State, and local health authorities, and the in-
10
ability to access data by public research institutions 
11
and academic organizations, poses a threat to anal-
12
ysis and synthesis of the pandemic impact on com-
13
munities of color. However, research and medical ex-
14
perts of Historically Black Colleges and Universities, 
15
academic health care institutions which are histori-
16
cally and geographically embedded in minoritized 
17
and marginalized communities, generally also pos-
18
sess rapport with the communities they serve. They 
19
are well-positioned, as trusted thought leaders and 
20
health care service providers, to collect data and con-
21
duct research toward creating holistic solutions to 
22
remedy the inequitable impact of this and future 
23
public health crises.

1
aligns with the goals of medicine, addresses ques-
2
tions relevant to the population among whom the 
3
study will be carried out, balances the potential for 
4
benefit against the potential for harm, employs 
5
study designs that will yield scientifically valid and 
6
significant data, and generates useful knowledge.

(19) The dearth of racially and ethnically

disaggregated data reflecting the health of commu-

10

associated with COVID–19 testing, hospitalizations,

(a) SHORT TITLE.—This section may be cited as the 
2
‘‘Mothers and Offspring Mortality and Morbidity Aware-
3
ness Act’’ or the ‘‘MOMMA’s Act’’. 
4
(b) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
5
(1) Every year, across the United States, 
6
4,000,000 women give birth, about 700 women suf-
7
fer fatal complications during pregnancy, while giv-
8
ing birth or during the postpartum period, and 
9
70,000 women suffer near-fatal, partum-related 
10
complications. 
11
(2) The maternal mortality rate is often used as 
12
a proxy to measure the overall health of a popu-
13
lation. While the infant mortality rate in the United 
14
States has reached its lowest point, the risk of death 
15
for women in the United States during pregnancy, 
16
childbirth, or the postpartum period is higher than 
17
such risk in many other developed nations. The esti-
18
mated maternal mortality rate (per 100,000 live 
19
births) for the 48 contiguous States and Wash-
20
ington, DC increased from 18.8 percent in 2000 to 
21
23.8 percent in 2014 to 26.6 percent in 2018. This 
22
estimated rate is on par with such rate for under-
23
developed nations such as Iraq and Afghanistan. 
24
(3) International studies estimate the 2015 ma-
25
ternal mortality rate in the United States as 26.4 
26
00:31 Nov 13, 2020
H8200
187 
•HR 8200 IH
per 100,000 live births, which is almost twice the 
1
2015 World Health Organization estimation of 14 
2
per 100,000 live births. 
3
(4) It is estimated that more than 60 percent 
4
of maternal deaths in the United States are prevent-
5
able. 
6
(5) According to the Centers for Disease Con-
7
trol and Prevention, the maternal mortality rate var-
8
ies drastically for women by race and ethnicity. 
9
There are 12.7 deaths per 100,000 live births for 
10
White women, 43.5 deaths per 100,000 live births 
11
for African-American women, and 14.4 deaths per 
12
100,000 live births for women of other ethnicities. 
13
While maternal mortality disparately impacts Afri-
14
can-American women, this urgent public health crisis 
15
traverses race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, edu-
16
cational background, and geography. 
17
(6) African-American women are 3 to 4 times 
18
more likely to die from causes related to pregnancy 
19
and childbirth compared to non-Hispanic White 
20
women.

(8) Hemorrhage, cardiovascular and coronary 
13
conditions, cardiomyopathy, infection, embolism, 
14
mental health conditions, preeclampsia and eclamp-
15
sia, polycystic ovary syndrome, infection and sepsis, 
16
and anesthesia complications are the predominant 
17
medical causes of maternal-related deaths and com-
18
plications. Most of these conditions are largely pre-
19
ventable or manageable. 
20
(9) Oral health is an important part of 
21
perinatal health. Reducing bacteria in a woman’s 
22
mouth during pregnancy can significantly reduce her 
23
risk of developing oral diseases and spreading decay- 
24
causing bacteria to her baby. Moreover, some evi-
25
00:31 Nov 13, 2020
H8200
189 
•HR 8200 IH
dence suggests that women with periodontal disease 
1
during pregnancy could be at greater risk for poor 
2
birth outcomes, such as preeclampsia, pre-term 
3
birth, and low-birth weight. Furthermore, a woman’s 
4
oral health during pregnancy is a good predictor of 
5
her newborn’s oral health, and since mothers can 
6
unintentionally spread oral bacteria to their babies, 
7
putting their children at higher risk for tooth decay, 
8
prevention efforts should happen even before chil-
9
dren are born, as a matter of pre-pregnancy health 
10
and prenatal care during pregnancy. 
11
(10) The United States has not been able to 
12
submit a formal maternal mortality rate to inter-
13
national data repositories since 2007. Thus, no offi-
14
cial maternal mortality rate exists for the United 
15
States. There can be no maternal mortality rate 
16
without streamlining maternal mortality-related data 
17
from the State level and extrapolating such data to 
18
the Federal level. 
19
(11) In the United States, death reporting and 
20
analysis is a State function rather than a Federal 
21
process. States report all deaths—including mater-
22
nal deaths—on a semi-voluntary basis, without 
23
standardization across States. While the Centers for 
24
Disease Control and Prevention has the capacity and 
25
00:31 Nov 13, 2020
H8200
190 
•HR 8200 IH
system for collecting death-related data based on 
1
death certificates, these data are not sufficiently re-
2
ported by States in an organized and standard for-
3
mat across States such that the Centers for Disease 
4
Control and Prevention is able to identify causes of 
5
maternal death and best practices for the prevention 
6
of such death. 
7
(12) Vital statistics systems often underesti-
8
mate maternal mortality and are insufficient data 
9
sources from which to derive a full scope of medical 
10
and social determinant factors contributing to ma-
11
ternal deaths. While the addition of pregnancy 
12
checkboxes on death certificates since 2003 have 
13
likely improved States’ abilities to identify preg-
14
nancy-related deaths, they are not generally com-
15
pleted by obstetrical providers or persons trained to 
16
recognize pregnancy-related mortality. Thus, these 
17
vital forms may be missing information or may cap-
18
ture inconsistent data. Due to varying maternal 
19
mortality-related analyses, lack of reliability, and 
20
granularity in data, current maternal mortality 
21
informatics do not fully encapsulate the myriad med-
22
ical and socially determinant factors that contribute 
23
to such high maternal mortality rates within the 
24
United States compared to other developed nations.

Lack of standardization of data and data sharing

across States and between Federal entities, health 
2
networks, and research institutions keep the Nation 
3
in the dark about ways to prevent maternal deaths. 
4
(13) Having reliable and valid State data ag-
5
gregated at the Federal level are critical to the Na-
6
tion’s ability to quell surges in maternal death and 
7
imperative for researchers to identify long-lasting 
8

9
(14) Leaders in maternal wellness highly rec-
10
ommend that maternal deaths be investigated at the 
11
State level first, and that standardized, streamlined, 
12
de-identified data regarding maternal deaths be sent 
13
annually to the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
14

would be similar in operation and effect to the Na-

(15) The United Nations’ Millennium Develop-
3
ment Goal 5a aimed to reduce by 75 percent, be-
4
tween 1990 and 2015, the maternal mortality rate, 
5
yet this metric has not been achieved. In fact, the 
6
maternal mortality rate in the United States has 
7
been estimated to have more than doubled between 
8
2000 and 2014. Yet, because national data are not 
9
fully available, the United States does not have an 
10
official maternal mortality rate. 
11
(16) Many States have struggled to establish or 
12
maintain Maternal Mortality Review Committees 
13
(referred to in this section as ‘‘MMRC’’). On the 
14
State level, MMRCs have lagged because States have 
15
not had the resources to mount local reviews. State- 
16
level reviews are necessary as only the State depart-
17
ments of health have the authority to request med-
18
ical records, autopsy reports, and police reports crit-
19
ical to the function of the MMRC. 
20
(17) The United Kingdom regards maternal 
21
deaths as a health systems failure and a national 
22
committee of obstetrics experts review each maternal 
23
death or near-fatal childbirth complication. Such 
24
committee also establishes the predominant course of

•HR 8200 IH
maternal-related deaths from conditions such as 
1
preeclampsia. Consequently, the United Kingdom 
2
has been able to reduce its incidence of preeclampsia 
3
to less than one in 10,000 women—its lowest rate 
4
since 1952. 
5
(18) The United States has no comparable, co-
6
ordinated Federal process by which to review cases 
7
of maternal mortality, systems failures, or best prac-
8
tices. Many States have active MMRCs and leverage 
9
their work to impact maternal wellness. For exam-
10
ple, the State of California has worked extensively 
11
with their State health departments, health and hos-
12
pital systems, and research collaborative organiza-
13
tions, including the California Maternal Quality Care 
14
Collaborative and the Alliance for Innovation on Ma-
15
ternal Health, to establish MMRCs, wherein such 
16
State has determined the most prevalent causes of 
17
maternal mortality and recorded and shared data 
18
with providers and researchers, who have developed 
19
and implemented safety bundles and care protocols 
20
related to preeclampsia, maternal hemorrhage, and 
21
the like. In this way, the State of California has 
22
been able to leverage its maternal mortality review

board system, generate data, and apply those data

ternal mortality rate, which is now comparable to 
2
the low rates of the United Kingdom. 
3
(19) Hospitals and health systems across the 
4
United States lack standardization of emergency ob-
5
stetrical protocols before, during, and after delivery. 
6
Consequently, many providers are delayed in recog-
7
nizing critical signs indicating maternal distress that 
8
quickly escalate into fatal or near-fatal incidences. 
9
Moreover, any attempt to address an obstetrical 
10
emergency that does not consider both clinical and 
11
public health approaches falls woefully under the 
12
mark of excellent care delivery. State-based maternal 
13
quality collaborative organizations, such as the Cali-
14
fornia Maternal Quality Care Collaborative or enti-
15
ties participating in the Alliance for Innovation on 
16
Maternal Health (AIM), have formed obstetrical pro-
17
tocols, tool kits, and other resources to improve sys-
18
tem care and response as they relate to maternal 
19
complications and warning signs for such conditions 
20
as 
maternal 
hemorrhage, 
hypertension, 
and 
21
preeclampsia. 
22
(20) The Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
23
vention reports that nearly half of all maternal 
24
deaths occur in the immediate postpartum period— 
25
00:31 Nov 13, 2020

•HR 8200 IH
the 42 days following a pregnancy—whereas more 
1
than one-third of pregnancy-related or pregnancy-as-
2
sociated deaths occur while a person is still preg-
3
nant. Yet, for women eligible for the Medicaid pro-
4
gram on the basis of pregnancy, such Medicaid cov-
5
erage lapses at the end of the month on which the 
6
60th postpartum day lands. 
7
(21) The experience of serious traumatic 
8
events, such as being exposed to domestic violence, 
9
substance use disorder, or pervasive racism, can 
10
over-activate the body’s stress-response system. 
11
Known as toxic stress, the repetition of high-doses 
12
of cortisol to the brain, can harm healthy neuro-
13
logical development, which can have cascading phys-
14
ical and mental health consequences, as documented 
15
in the Adverse Childhood Experiences study of the 
16
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
17
(22) A growing body of evidence-based research 
18
has shown the correlation between the stress associ-
19
ated with one’s race—the stress of racism—and 
20
one’s birthing outcomes. The stress of sex and race 
21
discrimination and institutional racism has been 
22
demonstrated to contribute to a higher risk of ma-
23
ternal mortality, irrespective of one’s gestational 
24
age, maternal age, socioeconomic status, or indi-

vidual-level health risk factors, including poverty, 
1
limited access to prenatal care, and poor physical 
2
and mental health (although these are not nominal 
3
factors). African-American women remain the most 
4
at risk for pregnancy-associated or pregnancy-re-
5
lated 
causes 
of 
death. 
When 
it 
comes 
to 
6
preeclampsia, for example, which is related to obe-
7
sity, African-American women of normal weight re-
8
main the most at risk of dying during the perinatal 
9
period compared to non-African-American obese 
10
women. 
11
(23) The rising maternal mortality rate in the 
12
United States is driven predominantly by the dis-
13
proportionately high rates of African-American ma-
14
ternal mortality. 
15
(24) African-American women are 3 to 4 times 
16
more likely to die from pregnancy or maternal-re-
17
lated distress than are White women, yielding one of 
18
the greatest and most disconcerting racial disparities 
19
in public health. 
20
(25) Compared to women from other racial and 
21
ethnic 
demographics, 
African-American 
women 
22
across the socioeconomic spectrum experience pro-
23
longed, unrelenting stress related to racial and gen-
24
der discrimination, contributing to higher rates of 
25

H8200
197 
•HR 8200 IH
maternal mortality, giving birth to low-weight ba-
1
bies, and experiencing pre-term birth. Racism is a 
2
risk-factor for these aforementioned experiences. 
3
This cumulative stress often extends across the life 
4
course and is situated in everyday spaces where Afri-
5
can-American women establish livelihood. Structural 
6
barriers, lack of access to care, and genetic pre-
7
dispositions to health vulnerabilities exacerbate Afri-
8
can-American women’s likelihood to experience poor 
9
or fatal birthing outcomes, but do not fully account 
10
for the great disparity. 
11
(26) African-American women are twice as like-
12
ly to experience postpartum depression, and dis-
13
proportionately higher rates of preeclampsia com-
14
pared to White women. 
15
(27) Racism is deeply ingrained in United 
16
States systems, including in health care delivery sys-
17
tems between patients and providers, often resulting 
18
in disparate treatment for pain, irreverence for cul-
19
tural 
norms 
with 
respect 
to 
health, 
and 
20
dismissiveness. Research has demonstrated that pa-
21
tients respond more warmly and adhere to medical 
22
treatment plans at a higher degree with providers of 
23
the same race or ethnicity or with providers with 
24
great ability to exercise empathy. However, the pro-

SEC. 604. IMPROVING SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. 
5
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
6
(1) Healthy People 2020 defines social deter-
7
minants of health as conditions in the environments 
8
in which people live, learn, work, play, worship, and 
9
age that affect a wide range of health, functioning, 
10
and quality-of-life outcomes and risks. 
11
(2) One of the overarching goals of Healthy 
12
People 2020 is to ‘‘create social and physical envi-
13
ronments that promote good health for all’’. 
14
(3) Healthy People 2020 developed a ‘‘place- 
15
based’’ organizing framework, reflecting five key 
16
areas of social determinants of health namely— 
17
(A) economic stability; 
18
(B) education; 
19
(C) social and community context; 
20
(D) health and health care; and 
21
(E) neighborhood and built environment. 
22
(4) It is estimated that medical care accounts 
23
for only 10 to 20 percent of the modifiable contribu-
24
tors to healthy outcomes for a population. 
25
00:31 Nov 13, 2020
H8200
265 
•HR 8200 IH
(5) The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Serv-
1
ices has indicated the importance of the social deter-
2
minants in its work stating that, ‘‘As we seek to fos-
3
ter innovation, rethink rural health, find solutions to 
4
the opioid epidemic, and continue to put patients 
5
first, we need to take into account social deter-
6
minants of health and recognize their importance.’’. 
7
(6) The Department of Health and Human 
8
Services’ Public Health 3.0 initiative recognizes the 
9
role of public health in working across sectors on so-
10
cial determinants of health, as well as the role of 
11
public health as chief health strategist in commu-
12
nities. 
13
(7) Through its Health Impact in 5 Years ini-
14
tiative, the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
15
tion has highlighted nonclinical, community-wide ap-
16
proaches that show positive health impacts, results 
17
within five years, and cost effectiveness or cost sav-
18
ings over the lifetime of the population or earlier. 
19
(8) Health departments and the Centers for 
20
Disease Control and Prevention are not funded for 
21
such cross-cutting work. 
22
(9) Providing grants to public health depart-
23
ments and other eligible entities to coordinate cross- 
24
sector collaboration will allow a community-wide, evi-

14
AUTHORITY 
OF 
SPECTRUM 
FOR 
TRIBES’ 
15
EMERGENCY RESPONSE IN INDIAN COUNTRY. 
16
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
17
(1) The immediate grant of emergency special 
18
temporary authority of available spectrum that will 
19
efficiently support temporary wireless broadband 
20
networks and allow Indian Tribes to provide Tribal 
21
members with wireless broadband service over Tribal 
22
lands or Hawaiian Home Lands during the COVID– 
23
19 crisis due to the increased demand for tele-

426 
•HR 8200 IH
communications and disproportionate impacts of the 
1
COVID–19 pandemic in Indian Country is essential. 
2
(2) Reservations are the most digitally discon-
3
nected areas in the United States that lack basic ac-
4
cess to broadband and wireless services at rates 
5
comparable to, and in some cases lower than, third- 
6
world countries. 
7
(3) In 2018, the Government Accountability Of-
8
fice and the Federal Communications Commission 
9
reported that only 65 percent of American Indian 
10
and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) living on Tribal lands 
11
had access to fixed broadband services, and only 68 
12
percent of AI/AN households on rural Tribal lands 
13
had telephone services. This is a stark comparison to 
14
only 8 percent of the national average that lacks ac-
15
cess to fixed broadband services. 
16
(4) Indian Tribes have previously encountered 
17
substantial barriers to accessing broadband and 
18
other communications services on Tribal lands to de-
19
ploy telecommunication services for the safety and 
20
well-being of Tribal members and to decrease the 
21
alarming rates of unnecessary loss of lives that AI/ 
22
ANs 
disproportionately 
experience, 
especially 
23
through the lack of access to health care services 
24
and emergency resources, as demonstrated during

427 
•HR 8200 IH
the COVID–19 pandemic that continues to dis-
1
proportionately impact Indian Country. 
2
(5) Indian Tribes’ lack of access to broadband 
3
services on Tribal lands and Hawaiian Home Lands 
4
during the COVID–19 pandemic further highlights 
5
the digital divide in Indian Country. 
6
(6) The Government Accountability Office 
7
found that health information technology systems at 
8
the Indian Health Service rank as the Federal Gov-
9
ernment’s third-highest need for agency system mod-
10
ernization, since 50 percent of Indian Health Service 
11
facilities depend on outdated circuit connections 
12
based on one or two TI circuit lines (3 Mbps), cre-
13
ating slower response times than any other health 
14
facility system in the United States. 
15
(7) A 2018 Tribal health reform comment filed 
16
with the Federal Communications Commission has 
17
further stated that approximately 1.5 million people 
18
living on Tribal lands lack access to broadband and, 
19
of the 75 percent of rural Indian Health Service fa-
20
cilities, many still lack reliable broadband networks 
21
for American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) 
22
to access telehealth or clinical health care services, 
23
which is a critical need in the most geographically 
24
isolated areas of the country with some of the high-

est poverty rates, and lack of access to reliable 
1
transportation. 
2
(8) The Bureau of Indian Education has stated 
3
that recent estimates from 142 out of 174 schools 
4
have indicated that approximately 15 to 95 percent 
5
of students do not have access to internet services 
6
at home depending on Bureau school location and 
7
limitations on data caps during the COVID–19 cri-
8

12
grams, and projects in order to maximize health 
13
benefits and minimize harms. 
14
(2) Health Impact Assessments fosters commu-
15
nity leadership, ownership and participation in deci-
16
sion-making processes. 
17
(3) Health Impact Assessments can build com-
